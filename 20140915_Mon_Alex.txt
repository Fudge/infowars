[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:38.080]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:38.080 --> 00:43.360]  ladies and gentlemen we are live and broadcasting worldwide thank you so much
[00:43.360 --> 00:50.560]  for joining us on this September 15th 2014 worldwide transmission I am your
[00:50.560 --> 00:57.680]  host Alex Jones obviously the Ebola story is really starting to get huge and
[00:57.680 --> 01:01.880]  is incredibly important they estimate more than 20,000 people very
[01:01.880 --> 01:07.360]  conservative number have Ebola right now in Africa as it exponentially spreads
[01:07.360 --> 01:13.240]  across the continent and we have this story by Paul Joseph Watson at info
[01:13.240 --> 01:19.480]  wars.com it's top-linked on drudge report.com US State Department orders
[01:19.480 --> 01:28.320]  160,000 Ebola hazmat suits Paul Watson co-hosted the Sunday show last night and
[01:28.320 --> 01:32.800]  I heard him breaking this down he has the article out today bulk purchases
[01:32.800 --> 01:41.880]  prompts concerns about spread of deadly epidemic continuing CDC issues Ebola
[01:41.880 --> 01:47.760]  checklist now is the time to prepare that story is also on drudge the Centers
[01:47.760 --> 01:52.680]  for Disease Control and Prevention warned hospitals and doctors that now is
[01:52.680 --> 01:56.480]  the time to prepare has issued a six-page Ebola checklist to help health
[01:56.480 --> 02:02.360]  care workers quickly determine if patients are infected all the CDC does
[02:02.360 --> 02:06.520]  not believe there are any new cases of Ebola in the United States the assumption
[02:06.520 --> 02:11.160]  is the checklist is that it is only a matter of time before the virus hits
[02:11.160 --> 02:16.960]  home for example one part reads encouraging health care personnel to use
[02:16.960 --> 02:21.360]  a buddy system when caring for patients another recommends a process to report
[02:21.360 --> 02:26.720]  cases to top officials and it goes on the checklist has been distributed to
[02:26.720 --> 02:31.800]  major hospitals and even little ones including urgent center in Leesburg
[02:31.800 --> 02:39.680]  Virginia and that dovetails again with our article directly from the Fed biz
[02:39.680 --> 02:47.200]  website that they have ordered the hundred and sixty thousand Ebola hazmat
[02:47.200 --> 02:52.720]  suits for Ebola bulk purchase prompts concerns about spread of deadly epidemic
[02:52.720 --> 02:57.000]  that's also being reported by Fox News the US State Department has ordered a
[02:57.000 --> 03:00.840]  hundred sixty thousand hazmat suits for Ebola prompting concerns that the
[03:00.840 --> 03:04.840]  federal government is anticipating the rapid spread of a virus that has
[03:04.840 --> 03:09.640]  already claimed an unprecedented number of lives in a press release posted to
[03:09.640 --> 03:15.240]  market watch Lakeland Industries the manufacturer of industry productive
[03:15.240 --> 03:20.600]  protective clothing for first responders announced that it had signaled its
[03:20.600 --> 03:25.040]  intention to join the fight against the spread of Ebola by encouraging other
[03:25.040 --> 03:30.040]  suppliers to meet the huge demand created by the US State Department ordering
[03:30.040 --> 03:34.960]  a hundred sixty thousand hazmat they put out other similar purchase orders again
[03:34.960 --> 03:42.640]  on the Fez been fed biz ops website with the US State Department alone putting
[03:42.640 --> 03:45.960]  on a bid for a hundred sixty thousand suits we encourage all protective
[03:45.960 --> 03:50.720]  apparel companies to increase their manufacturing capacity for sealed seam
[03:50.720 --> 03:54.800]  garments so that our industry can do its part of addressing this threat to global
[03:54.800 --> 03:58.560]  health and it just goes on from there I'll read more when we come back from
[03:58.560 --> 04:04.200]  break but this is pretty frightening information Friday we covered the
[04:04.200 --> 04:10.440]  articles in fact we you guys repull those out of the stack where top
[04:10.440 --> 04:15.400]  virologist out of Germany top World Health Organization virologist and others
[04:15.400 --> 04:23.680]  are saying millions are infected millions more will be infected and that
[04:23.680 --> 04:29.920]  they believe five million will die I'm not saying any of that a month ago or
[04:29.920 --> 04:35.040]  more than a month ago back on August 4th we talked about public documents that
[04:35.040 --> 04:40.120]  governments believe for two years that airborne is becoming above somewhat
[04:40.120 --> 04:44.000]  airborne not extremely airborne but can survive in the air long enough to be
[04:44.000 --> 04:48.200]  transmitted and we know it's just stating longer so that's why there's
[04:48.200 --> 04:53.880]  undoubtedly also carriers that are immune or resistant but that the viral

[08:38.240 --> 08:42.960]  ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for joining us today it is already the
[08:42.960 --> 08:50.280]  15th day hard to believe of September 2014 before we know it will be into
[08:50.280 --> 08:58.280]  2015 2016 and beyond obviously we're going to be focusing front and center on
[08:58.280 --> 09:05.200]  Ebola today but we have the backdrop of stories like this one out of the daily
[09:05.200 --> 09:10.640]  male dozens of Christians including women and children are arrested in Saudi
[09:10.640 --> 09:18.320]  Arabia after tip-off to states Islamist police force having a secret Christian
[09:18.320 --> 09:26.320]  meeting that is who our government is most allied with the Middle East is a
[09:26.320 --> 09:34.160]  group that will chop your head off if you're caught secretly worshiping Christ
[09:34.160 --> 09:40.880]  where is the tolerance we have the radical Islamic lobby in this country
[09:40.880 --> 09:47.840]  constantly pushing for everyone to basically adopt their worldview and
[09:47.840 --> 09:56.400]  we're so politically correct that we can't even hardly criticize ISIS as it
[09:56.400 --> 10:01.640]  runs around murdering people because it's Saudi Arabia funding the entire
[10:01.640 --> 10:09.680]  operation and it's since come out over the weekend that indeed almost all of
[10:09.680 --> 10:14.560]  the so-called rebels are the al-qaeda ISIS people in Syria that Obama is now
[10:14.560 --> 10:20.240]  saying he's going to pay money to to fight ISIS and then they just change
[10:20.240 --> 10:25.000]  their name to something else and attack Assad with all the new aid and weapons
[10:25.000 --> 10:30.160]  they've been given that's the real game plan here the American people woke up a
[10:30.160 --> 10:33.720]  year ago and didn't want to join forces with al-qaeda openly to attack a
[10:33.720 --> 10:38.800]  sovereign nation that had done nothing to anybody Syria also a pipeline can be
[10:38.800 --> 10:42.480]  run out of the Mediterranean right through Israel and Lebanon straight
[10:42.480 --> 10:50.000]  through Syria up to Europe to cut off the Russians that's one of the big
[10:50.000 --> 10:55.800]  reasons this is happening and its piracy using American muscle and money and
[10:55.800 --> 11:01.680]  and military weapons and then our name show that big oil companies the
[11:01.680 --> 11:09.760]  globalist and others can have control of that region completely which will also
[11:09.760 --> 11:13.800]  drive up gas prices again because they're not trying to compete with Russian
[11:13.800 --> 11:19.640]  gas they're trying to cut off Russian gas in the Ukraine or take it Joe Biden
[11:19.640 --> 11:23.200]  Sun is the head of a company now that's worth billions overnight that's
[11:23.200 --> 11:26.800]  declared ownership of basically Russian gas supplies and Russian gas
[11:26.800 --> 11:33.800]  corridors it is just wild to see how Al Capone all of this is but it's Al Capone
[11:33.800 --> 11:40.160]  squared and then of course as I've told you over and over again they will use
[11:40.160 --> 11:44.800]  the new al-qaeda threat under the name ISIL ISIS or IS to take American
[11:44.800 --> 11:50.680]  liberties and set up a bigger police state this is in Politico today Holder
[11:50.680 --> 11:55.480]  launches media campaign against homegrown terrorist cities across the
[11:55.480 --> 11:59.840]  nation to participate in pilot program of basically see something say something
[11:59.840 --> 12:04.400]  this is the cover for the checkpoints of the federalization and then they'll
[12:04.400 --> 12:10.080]  flip it back on to the Tea Party gun owners veterans things like that so we're
[12:10.080 --> 12:14.040]  gonna be breaking all of that down today now let's talk about the computer
[12:14.040 --> 12:25.040]  models last week top German virologist came out in build one of the biggest
[12:25.040 --> 12:31.200]  German publications and said quote it's too late Ebola will kill five million
[12:31.200 --> 12:36.600]  close quote according to current computer models and you have all these
[12:36.600 --> 12:40.720]  different African countries like Liberia and others Sierra Leone saying it may
[12:40.720 --> 12:48.240]  collapse them completely and it's much higher than 20,000 the numbers are 100,000
[12:48.240 --> 12:54.840]  with Ebola by December because it's exponentially growing right now
[12:56.480 --> 13:01.640]  Ebola outpaces global response who says that was on Friday let's look at the
[13:01.640 --> 13:08.080]  headlines today these are up on drudgereport.com CDC prepare for Ebola
[13:08.080 --> 13:14.800]  that's out of the Washington beacon but direct links to the CDC putting out the
[13:14.800 --> 13:20.240]  alerts the hospitals saying prepare for it then we have this report from info
[13:20.240 --> 13:25.280]  wars.com directly linking to the State Department purchase order State
[13:25.280 --> 13:38.280]  Department orders 160,000 Ebola hazmat suits alone for themselves so who was
[13:38.280 --> 13:47.200]  right back on August 4th a month and 12 days ago or 11 days ago who was right
[13:47.200 --> 13:53.640]  I'm gonna say this again who was right to put out news articles saying it was
[13:53.640 --> 13:57.320]  becoming a serious epidemic and threatened millions and that top virologist
[13:57.320 --> 14:00.840]  and others were saying they believe that it had made the first step towards
[14:00.840 --> 14:07.880]  going completely airborne meaning it could survive inside sneeze droplets
[14:07.880 --> 14:13.720]  mucus spit and look like it might even be going more airborne than that info
[14:13.720 --> 14:22.720]  wars.com prisonplanet.com we simply pointed to medical reports mainline
[14:22.720 --> 14:30.280]  news from two years ago saying that and then we asked the question why then is
[14:30.280 --> 14:35.880]  the mainstream media attacking us for saying this because for some reason they
[14:35.880 --> 14:39.320]  didn't want the public to understand how big a crisis this was that it was
[14:39.320 --> 14:43.480]  growing it was real plus it was fun to attack the new media the real media the
[14:43.480 --> 14:47.840]  non-state run media the talking point for whatever reason was Ebola's no big
[14:47.840 --> 14:53.960]  deal it's fair monitoring you talk about it while governments got prepared I
[14:53.960 --> 14:58.560]  don't know or or is this a staged bio attack has it been weaponized I don't
[14:58.560 --> 15:02.400]  know have Western governments been messing with Ebola for decades trying to
[15:02.400 --> 15:06.600]  weaponize it that's come out yeah there it is conspiracy theorist joins Dick
[15:06.600 --> 15:13.000]  Morris and shares views on Ebola outbreak claims it could be airborne that was
[15:13.000 --> 15:20.040]  August 6 when Paul Watson was on CBS news with Dick Morris and then the next
[15:20.040 --> 15:29.720]  day they came out and made fun of him conspiracy theorist Paul Watson says it
[15:29.720 --> 15:37.640]  could be airborne no Watson on CBS shited the federal and CDC studies and the
[15:37.640 --> 15:44.720]  World Health Organization studies from 2011 2012 on the laboratory test showing
[15:44.720 --> 15:52.280]  it was making it from a pin of monkeys to a pin of pigs that were not in the
[15:52.280 --> 15:59.680]  same area meaning airborne and then finally on Friday or actually Thursday
[15:59.680 --> 16:04.480]  September 11th what we're all afraid to say about Ebola New York Times that it's
[16:04.480 --> 16:10.640]  beginning to go airborne and mutating more than 200 known mutations in just
[16:10.640 --> 16:17.280]  the last few months so there you go I don't know the truth of how bad it is I
[16:17.280 --> 16:20.960]  don't think anybody does because there's not a lot of medical surveillance as they
[16:20.960 --> 16:28.600]  would call it in Africa but I tell you everything that hits Africa HIV Ebola you
[16:28.600 --> 16:34.320]  name it we know HIV is a weaponized autoimmune disorder that is race specific
[16:34.320 --> 16:39.800]  and much worse it was in the medical literature in the 80s that it's much
[16:39.800 --> 16:44.920]  worse in Africans and then it goes down the line genetically into Hispanics and
[16:44.920 --> 16:57.040]  others that HIV is much much much more aggressive in a more what they would call
[16:57.040 --> 17:06.960]  dominant trait bloodline everything white is a recessive mutation redheads
[17:06.960 --> 17:11.880]  are a completely recessive mutation almost not even on the current human
[17:11.880 --> 17:14.960]  chain and I'm part redhead I'm not bashing redheads here this is just the
[17:14.960 --> 17:19.840]  stuff they don't tell people so see they can make whatever they want ladies and
[17:19.840 --> 17:27.040]  gentlemen and it's very very dangerous to attack though the original human
[17:27.040 --> 17:31.600]  bloodline because the elite think they can control all this stuff a it's
[17:31.600 --> 17:34.880]  immoral and evil be it could end up spreading across the board and of
[17:34.880 --> 17:38.080]  course it could be an accident to all these labs all these vaccines being
[17:38.080 --> 17:42.960]  produced all these GMO systems crossing animals and plants and animals and
[17:42.960 --> 17:51.280]  fish within sex I mean it is just who knows but they use medical ignorance
[17:51.280 --> 18:04.440]  out there about all these issues so the public has no idea what's even going on
[18:05.520 --> 18:10.480]  but it's getting serious I'm gonna say this again US State Department orders a
[18:10.480 --> 18:14.400]  hundred and sixty thousand Ebola hazmat suits bulk purchases prompts concerns
[18:14.400 --> 18:20.760]  about spread of deadly epidemic info wars.com the examiner CDC issues Ebola
[18:20.760 --> 18:26.960]  checklist now it's time to prepare this is confirmed from the local hospitals
[18:26.960 --> 18:37.760]  they have copies of the checklist so I want to open the phones up for medical
[18:37.760 --> 18:42.760]  doctors for nurses for people that have been in the Congo been in the West Coast
[18:42.760 --> 18:51.720]  of Africa been in Central Africa people that work at the CDC folks that have
[18:51.720 --> 19:00.960]  survived different types of jungle viral infections what does your gut tell you
[19:00.960 --> 19:05.080]  about this then you've got the army and the Marines for at least six years
[19:05.080 --> 19:10.600]  training during a biological outbreak in the training manuals this is
[19:10.600 --> 19:13.880]  associated press Reuters you name it if you're a new Lester this sounds crazy
[19:13.880 --> 19:18.400]  so just please look it up yourself that will we'll come back and read one of
[19:18.400 --> 19:22.680]  the articles because it sounds so wild to quote kill zombies and mass during a
[19:22.680 --> 19:26.920]  biological outbreak where humans are running around biting and killing each
[19:26.920 --> 19:32.240]  other from a virus well the closest thing you can like in that too is Ebola so
[19:32.240 --> 19:35.480]  the Marines and the army are training to mow people down and mass during this
[19:35.480 --> 19:41.280]  while they've brought patients to South Dakota and four patients to Atlanta and
[19:41.280 --> 19:46.320]  patients to Spain and Germany and all over bringing Ebola in when it's never
[19:46.320 --> 19:51.240]  been done before and where now it just dates over several weeks not three days
[19:51.240 --> 19:56.480]  so you can just spread it and spread it spread it as a carrier it's just it's

[24:38.160 --> 24:42.040]  it's always interesting just to get your take on this also want to ask the public
[24:42.040 --> 24:46.440]  just in general but but doctors and medical people go to the head of the
[24:46.440 --> 24:51.440]  line where do you think this whole Ebola situation is going again if you just
[24:51.440 --> 24:54.960]  tuned in it's the Alex Jones show them your host Alex Jones we're here Monday
[24:54.960 --> 24:59.400]  through Friday from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. central the news websites are in full
[24:59.400 --> 25:04.640]  wars comm and prison planet comm u.s. State Department has ordered 160,000
[25:04.640 --> 25:10.440]  Ebola hazmat suits CDC is issued Ebola checklist saying quote now is the time
[25:10.440 --> 25:15.960]  to prepare the u.s. hospitals this is confirmed Dutch Ebola doctors to be
[25:15.960 --> 25:25.240]  evacuated on Sunday and this broke yesterday to Dutch doctors feared to
[25:25.240 --> 25:28.640]  have contracted deadly Ebola virus while working in Sierra Leone or sent me
[25:28.640 --> 25:32.760]  flown back to the Netherlands as soon as possible this is what's happening
[25:32.760 --> 25:36.680]  there's like a race by governments to get people that have it I guess to take
[25:36.680 --> 25:42.520]  their blood and try to figure out a cure or weaponize it I don't know but my dad
[25:42.520 --> 25:45.960]  pointed out and he's got a biology background is also an oral surgeon and
[25:45.960 --> 25:50.040]  worked in drug development and I looked it up last night when he mentioned it to
[25:50.040 --> 25:54.240]  me a yesterday I was over at his house with the kids swimming I looked it up
[25:54.240 --> 25:57.440]  and it's a whole area hadn't been looked at yet that we should probably write
[25:57.440 --> 26:04.160]  about and that's that you you don't just have this lasting weeks now in the body
[26:04.160 --> 26:07.480]  instead of taking days to show signs you can spread it further you're going to
[26:07.480 --> 26:15.480]  have carriers who have a quote high viral titer whose bodies haven't beaten it but
[26:15.480 --> 26:19.200]  that they're not dying from it and there's always a percentage of people
[26:19.200 --> 26:23.120]  with different mutations genetically to be able to handle it and it's inside
[26:23.120 --> 26:26.760]  those people that you get the mutations of the virus because it just keeps
[26:26.760 --> 26:30.800]  cooking in there they can go through a lot of different permutations inside one
[26:30.800 --> 26:37.160]  person and undoubtedly there's there's there's master carriers out there like
[26:37.160 --> 26:44.400]  typhoid Mary better known as typhoid Mary a Mary Mowen was the first person
[26:44.400 --> 26:50.320]  United States identified as a asymptomatic carrier of the pathogen
[26:50.320 --> 26:57.320]  associated with typhoid fever she was presumed to have affected 53 people three
[26:57.320 --> 27:02.800]  of whom died over the course of her career as a cook she was twice forcibly
[27:02.800 --> 27:06.480]  isolated by public health authorities and died after a total of nearly three
[27:06.480 --> 27:15.760]  decades in isolation so there is undoubtedly the typhoid Mary's of Ebola
[27:15.760 --> 27:21.160]  out there right now and that's a big question here that my dad was raising
[27:21.160 --> 27:27.080]  and again when I looked it up it was like wow this is well known that you
[27:27.080 --> 27:30.760]  can't just bring these doctors and nurses back here and keep them for a few
[27:30.760 --> 27:36.000]  months and let them go because it's very hard to identify if somebody still got
[27:36.000 --> 27:39.680]  the virus embedded in them it might pop back up and keep spreading basically and
[27:39.680 --> 27:44.520]  that's a layman just for me reading the medical info and that's all I do you know
[27:44.520 --> 27:50.040]  five weeks ago I was just reading CDC reports that they believe Ebola was
[27:50.040 --> 27:54.480]  beginning to go airborne and they confirmed it was monkeys on one end of
[27:54.480 --> 27:58.880]  the lab were infecting pigs on another end in test in Africa and there's other
[27:58.880 --> 28:03.240]  studies so I said hey right you know right about that and because we were the
[28:03.240 --> 28:07.840]  first to point it out oh no you can't break something you can't be smart you
[28:07.840 --> 28:12.480]  can't think of basic logic no you're a liar drudge is a liar drudge is fair
[28:12.480 --> 28:16.240]  mongering how dare drudge remember heraldos of era how dare drudge hyped
[28:16.240 --> 28:23.480]  the Ebola and the rest of it well I think all the political correctness is
[28:23.480 --> 28:26.840]  trumped by the fact that Ebola makes you bleed out in a horrible way and it's
[28:26.840 --> 28:30.240]  extremely painful and it's spreading exponentially I think it's political
[28:30.240 --> 28:36.160]  correct to just kind of brush off Africa and just not discuss it see how they
[28:36.160 --> 28:41.560]  use that actually to cover stuff up and so we need to have poll Watson or whoever
[28:41.560 --> 28:50.680]  write an article or somebody else out there the tie you know Ebola carriers
[28:50.680 --> 28:57.200]  sleeper cells of Ebola carriers could already be in the US or could already be
[28:57.200 --> 29:01.480]  in Europe something like that because that's the angle that I'm worried about
[29:01.480 --> 29:06.160]  when I sit here and look at this what do I think about myself my children the
[29:06.160 --> 29:12.680]  larger community where my children live humanity my goodwill I'm worried about
[29:12.680 --> 29:26.480]  typhoid Mary typhoid Ebola I'm worried about Ebola Mary Ebola Mary we know that
[29:26.480 --> 29:32.320]  some carriers can carry viruses for years and keep infecting are there Ebola
[29:32.320 --> 29:39.160]  Mary's loose in the world today undoubtedly in Africa there are people
[29:39.160 --> 29:44.320]  that have survived from it but the virus is staying active in them so already in
[29:44.320 --> 29:48.760]  Africa this is like a zombie apocalypse it's already reached that area we're on
[29:48.760 --> 29:54.520]  the March the Empire so right not fair mongering Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[29:54.520 --> 29:58.360]  we said it will be right back

[34:50.400 --> 34:55.840]  you're out there listening we have millions of listeners worldwide 800 259
[34:55.840 --> 35:06.120]  92 31 800 259 92 31 since I mentioned it they did find Christian science monitor
[35:06.120 --> 35:13.680]  AP you name it we'll put those back on screen from 2012 2013 were the army and
[35:13.680 --> 35:21.720]  we're FEMA and we're the CDC there's raw story US military trains to fight
[35:21.720 --> 35:29.800]  zombies US military forces train for zombie apocalypse November 2012 for a
[35:29.800 --> 35:35.040]  viral outbreak that turns the population into something like walking dead what is
[35:35.040 --> 35:41.200]  the only virus to be close to this that's rabies which they've always been
[35:41.200 --> 35:46.880]  worried might go airborne and is similar to Ebola in fact that a lot of
[35:46.880 --> 35:50.960]  experts believe that the super weapon would be Ebola crossed with airborne
[35:50.960 --> 35:55.880]  rabies they found another one seeing in Pentagon document lays out battle plan
[35:55.880 --> 36:00.600]  against zombies no they don't want to freak the public out so they call them
[36:00.600 --> 36:05.040]  zombies but if you read the paperwork and then they have actual drills it's to
[36:05.040 --> 36:10.960]  mow down masses of crowds for a viral outbreak but also during civil unrest
[36:10.960 --> 36:16.040]  like the in the scene in V for vendetta that's kind of based on what happened
[36:16.040 --> 36:19.560]  and with the fall of Chalcescu in Romania you got hundreds of thousands of
[36:19.560 --> 36:23.600]  people marching up to the ministry and the troops refused to fire on them so
[36:23.600 --> 36:28.200]  they take down the corrupt government well they want the troops to mow the
[36:28.200 --> 36:34.040]  people down so it's a simulant to say oh they're not human they're zombies and
[36:34.040 --> 36:37.640]  to train troops to mow down peaceful crowds but it's also in the training
[36:37.640 --> 36:45.280]  dual like all military training is generally on multi facets they are
[36:45.280 --> 36:51.440]  carrying it out in preparation for an Ebola a human transmitted mouse pox
[36:51.440 --> 36:58.040]  something like that human transmitted mouse pox and it only takes a couple
[36:58.040 --> 37:01.840]  hundred thousand dollars to design this with the right laboratory the FBI tried
[37:01.840 --> 37:06.040]  to block its release four years ago but was unable to they have released in the
[37:06.040 --> 37:10.080]  U.S. Canada and Australia three different university studies that are
[37:10.080 --> 37:17.000]  public on how to make human mouse pox that kills 90 plus percent of people
[37:17.000 --> 37:21.480]  some numbers are 98% now some idiots every time I mentioned that send me
[37:21.480 --> 37:26.520]  emails saying how dare you tell people that the mouse pox recipe is out it was
[37:26.520 --> 37:31.560]  all over the news okay it's like when we go show the southern borders open
[37:31.560 --> 37:36.680]  people say don't show it's wide open the terrorist believe me if there's any
[37:36.680 --> 37:42.840]  terrorists down there they know it's open more information exposes it's open
[37:42.840 --> 37:50.160]  and hopefully gets it under control sunshine is what stops these type of
[37:50.160 --> 37:56.420]  political infections there it is killer mouse pox virus raises bio-terror fears
[37:56.420 --> 38:02.760]  2001 killer mouse pox virus raises bio-terror fears and that was new
[38:02.760 --> 38:07.960]  scientists and back then they hadn't released it yet hadn't released how to
[38:07.960 --> 38:14.320]  make it and Western governments who I don't usually agree with tried to stop
[38:14.320 --> 38:17.880]  it for a long time but it was released there's the New York Times bio-terror
[38:17.880 --> 38:23.440]  researchers build a more lethal mouse pox and so this is an ongoing serial
[38:23.440 --> 38:29.720]  situation where it just happens repeatedly because governments continually
[38:29.720 --> 38:34.640]  try to block it my six FBI don't release that and generally I'm all for
[38:34.640 --> 38:40.120]  releasing university research but they shouldn't be creating weaponized mouse
[38:40.120 --> 38:45.880]  pox and weaponized Ebola they shouldn't be creating weaponized rabies and they
[38:45.880 --> 38:53.120]  sure shouldn't be releasing how to do it now call me conspiracy theorist common
[38:53.120 --> 38:57.920]  sense is now called conspiracy theory that's all I'm doing is putting out
[38:57.920 --> 39:05.160]  common sense here if you just joined us Obama to ask for 88 million to boost
[39:05.160 --> 39:11.520]  anti Ebola effort that's out of the rapler.com what does that mean you're
[39:11.520 --> 39:16.160]  doing that to then fly more Ebola patients back here and then put them in
[39:16.160 --> 39:20.760]  facilities that don't even have proper protection in them again we pointed this
[39:20.760 --> 39:24.840]  out back last month and we're called evil demons we're saying why are you
[39:24.840 --> 39:28.320]  flying people in when it's never been done before and you're not supposed to
[39:28.320 --> 39:31.640]  and this stuff could clearly already be airborne and you're not even putting them
[39:31.640 --> 39:34.720]  in level four bio weapons labs you're putting them in university research
[39:34.720 --> 39:41.320]  hospitals this is crazy I'm trying to not rant and rave here but it is just
[39:41.320 --> 39:48.400]  amazing they have CBS news call us conspiracy theorist on August 6 and AP
[39:48.400 --> 39:52.680]  and everybody else because we dared link to federal documents that are on the
[39:52.680 --> 40:00.000]  CDC website how dare us and I'm not making this about info wars and whining
[40:00.000 --> 40:05.320]  here I'm angry because what are they doing producing weaponized mouse pox
[40:05.320 --> 40:10.280]  weaponized rabies do you know what the only thing that would make people
[40:10.280 --> 40:16.720]  actually act like zombies and run around biting people would be weaponized rabies
[40:16.720 --> 40:22.600]  have you ever seen somebody dying of rabies I have seen a university
[40:22.600 --> 40:29.880]  film clip of it and let me tell you didn't pretty it's a lot scary in these
[40:29.880 --> 40:33.920]  zombies in these movies someone chained down strapped down to a gurney with
[40:33.920 --> 40:38.600]  sweat pouring off of them biting so hard their teeth break off with their eyes
[40:38.600 --> 40:47.560]  bugging out it makes the shining video whenever the actor comes through the
[40:47.560 --> 40:57.520]  door with the hatchet it makes Jack Nicholson look like an angelic creature
[40:57.520 --> 41:03.600]  what rabies makes people behave like and they've been messing with that on record
[41:03.600 --> 41:10.840]  for 50 something years Plum Island weaponized tick-borne syphilis is now
[41:10.840 --> 41:15.760]  called on record Lyme's disease and it's spread all over the country from the
[41:15.760 --> 41:25.640]  east coast from New York and it was a US facility run by Nazis declassified and
[41:25.640 --> 41:31.120]  then the deer one mile from New York swam across from Plum Island deer will
[41:31.120 --> 41:36.680]  do that when they're starving and introduced weaponized ticks to the
[41:36.680 --> 41:43.160]  United States it's syphilis ladies and gentlemen weaponized tick-borne syphilis
[41:43.160 --> 41:47.560]  that the Nazis had looked at in World War two trying to develop to drop on the
[41:47.560 --> 41:50.680]  Russians let's go back to that other article the guys are doing searches
[41:50.680 --> 41:54.040]  right now on the TV and showing viewers what we're talking about yeah let's not
[41:54.040 --> 42:03.720]  forget they dug up dead whalers from the North Pole back in 2005 to get the
[42:03.720 --> 42:10.520]  weaponized super flu and try to weaponize it even more special report the
[42:10.520 --> 42:17.960]  1918 flu virus is resurrected the Journal of Nature all right I said I'd go to
[42:17.960 --> 42:23.200]  your phone calls it's governments that are endangering us it's governments that
[42:23.200 --> 42:26.880]  help create ISIS and turn them loose
[42:29.720 --> 42:34.040]  hundreds of years ago it was reported that rabies was used as a biological
[42:34.040 --> 42:42.080]  weapon in the Middle Ages there's nothing new under the sun and you tie all
[42:42.080 --> 42:46.720]  this together it's crazy State Department orders a hundred sixty thousand
[42:46.720 --> 42:52.920]  Ebola hazmat suits they tell hospitals nationwide prepare for Ebola are you in
[42:52.920 --> 42:56.480]  a hospital that's gotten these notices give us a call I mean it's confirmed
[42:56.480 --> 43:02.280]  we're not asking you to confirm it give us your take on it eight hundred two five
[43:02.280 --> 43:07.200]  at nine ninety two thirty one we got Sean Tim Chris Christopher Dr. Davis and
[43:07.200 --> 43:13.880]  others and we're gonna go to Sean and others but first Dr. Davis in Florida
[43:13.880 --> 43:20.760]  wants to give us his take on this go ahead Dr. Davis hi Alex how are you I'm
[43:20.760 --> 43:24.160]  doing okay I guess I don't know why they're bringing Ebola patients back to
[43:24.160 --> 43:27.600]  the US they're supposed to keep them on medical Navy ships but I guess they
[43:27.600 --> 43:32.000]  don't do that anymore what do you think about this well I think it's ridiculous
[43:32.000 --> 43:35.800]  to bring these patients back it introduces risks that are just not
[43:35.800 --> 43:39.680]  reasonable and like you said there you can put a level three containment
[43:39.680 --> 43:44.200]  facility on just about any Navy ship and keep those people away from the rest
[43:44.200 --> 43:48.920]  of the population it only makes common sense why do you think they're bringing
[43:48.920 --> 43:53.840]  so many Ebola patients back to South Dakota and Georgia and other states I
[43:53.840 --> 43:58.960]  can't even speculate because it makes absolutely no sense like I said it
[43:58.960 --> 44:03.000]  creates risk where you don't have to have risk it just doesn't make an overall
[44:03.000 --> 44:08.800]  view of the Ebola epidemic well I think that from my perspective of running a
[44:08.800 --> 44:13.200]  biotech company that has a potential solution for this in a drug that we've
[44:13.200 --> 44:18.320]  developed and work with the army on it all of the emphasis right now appears
[44:18.320 --> 44:23.640]  to be on vaccines and I think that that's a mistaken solution because if you
[44:23.640 --> 44:27.520]  have hyper mutation like you have in this particular viral strain it's
[44:27.520 --> 44:33.400]  impossible to anticipate how it might mutate which is the key to developing a
[44:33.400 --> 44:38.800]  successful vaccine you you have to look forward at where it's gonna go and you
[44:38.800 --> 44:42.240]  can't predict where this is gonna go so I don't believe that the vaccines that
[44:42.240 --> 44:46.120]  Glaxo or any of the other companies are trying to work on even though I believe
[44:46.120 --> 44:50.000]  in those from a scientific standpoint I simply don't believe that you can predict
[44:50.000 --> 44:54.320]  where this will go well in order to make enough vaccines it'll make a you know a
[44:54.320 --> 44:57.560]  reasonable protection for the population sure well you've been a guest on the
[44:57.560 --> 45:00.000]  show before I'm glad you got into that you want to write an article for us
[45:00.000 --> 45:04.800]  about that and send it over we'd like to get your perspective on why an Ebola
[45:04.800 --> 45:09.200]  vaccine won't work at this point thank you so much for the call Sean in the
[45:09.200 --> 45:15.080]  bottom as a doctor works in an emergency room Sean thanks for calling in and give
[45:15.080 --> 45:21.040]  us your take on the situation hey thanks for having me Alex my take is that we
[45:21.040 --> 45:24.920]  may be dealing with something more than just spread by you know bodily fluids
[45:24.920 --> 45:30.880]  you know we get a CDC announcement today that you need to have a respirator you
[45:30.880 --> 45:35.120]  need to have basically a level 3 biosuit to engage with these patients
[45:35.120 --> 45:39.840]  that's becoming concerning to me that CDC sends something out like that
[45:39.840 --> 45:43.960]  unfortunately they can lag in their response to different infections and
[45:43.960 --> 45:48.360]  then the state of Nevada if you're a licensed physician you get notifications
[45:48.360 --> 45:55.480]  through the the sort of infectious disease gurus out of Vegas and they are
[45:55.480 --> 45:59.600]  now sending out a warning sheet of what to look for in patients who may have
[45:59.600 --> 46:03.800]  Ebola and as far as I know that there are quote-unquote no reported cases of
[46:03.800 --> 46:08.880]  Ebola in the United States but now because it takes weeks for it to
[46:08.880 --> 46:13.960]  show up before you know somebody sick I guess that's why they're doing this
[46:13.960 --> 46:18.720]  well my my concern is is that do we have a bunch of little time bombs walking
[46:18.720 --> 46:22.520]  around the streets of America that are going to suddenly explode and we're
[46:22.520 --> 46:26.240]  going to suddenly start having cases and certainly doesn't help like Dr. Davis
[46:26.240 --> 46:30.560]  suggested bringing in infected people because none of us really trained for
[46:30.560 --> 46:34.080]  dealing with this level of infectious disease it's not commonplace for us to
[46:34.080 --> 46:39.440]  down up and deal with patients of this caliber in our emergency rooms here in
[46:39.440 --> 46:42.280]  America and so it's really concerning that it's probably going to walk into
[46:42.280 --> 46:45.840]  one of our emergency rooms one day and you're going to have staff that are
[46:45.840 --> 46:48.640]  going to be fearful to care for these patients you're going to have staff that
[46:48.640 --> 46:52.360]  become infected and the ultimately other patients who are already jeopardized
[46:52.360 --> 46:56.320]  medically in the hospital becoming contaminated and it's going to be a
[46:56.320 --> 47:03.400]  nightmare I'll tell you what do you make of the typhoid Mary scenario that some
[47:03.400 --> 47:07.200]  of these people may be basically immune from it but may still be long-term
[47:07.200 --> 47:11.960]  carriers not just for two or three weeks but for longer this could just keep
[47:11.960 --> 47:16.640]  going on and on if it gets out of Africa which Ebola's never done because they
[47:16.640 --> 47:20.680]  would never allow people out of Africa that had it I just it seems like
[47:20.680 --> 47:26.160]  intentional that they're trying to have a cover story for why Ebola gets into the
[47:26.160 --> 47:32.720]  West I think you're absolutely right Alex that kind of scenario that is very
[47:32.720 --> 47:37.440]  concerning and unfortunately people may be you know sharing space with these
[47:37.440 --> 47:41.400]  folks already and unfortunately with the international travel as it is now and
[47:41.400 --> 47:45.520]  really kind of unregulated when screening for diseases like this I mean my
[47:45.520 --> 47:48.920]  thoughts are it's already here and if we do have somebody who's resistant to the
[47:48.920 --> 47:52.920]  virus then those people are going to be able to go farther and longer without
[47:52.920 --> 47:57.600]  detection and you're absolutely right about that scenario Wow a lot of medical
[47:57.600 --> 48:02.240]  doctors and virologists are saying that it's much worse than what the CDC or
[48:02.240 --> 48:05.840]  World Health Organization saying this top German virologist told Bill the
[48:05.840 --> 48:10.040]  Friday that he believes five million people from the computer models they
[48:10.040 --> 48:14.760]  have will and this is one of the top virology facilities in the world five
[48:14.760 --> 48:20.560]  million will die I mean I don't know I'm not a virologist what does that sound
[48:20.560 --> 48:25.580]  like to you sounds conceivable I mean it's happened before in our history so
[48:25.580 --> 48:29.080]  I'd be if something like the Spanish flu can wipe out gross swaths of
[48:29.080 --> 48:33.400]  population then absolutely this can and we're really not prepared for it I
[48:33.400 --> 48:37.160]  think unfortunately a lot of Americans have their heads buried and think they're
[48:37.160 --> 48:41.120]  immune or protected or it's not going to be me and that kind of mentality doesn't
[48:41.120 --> 48:44.800]  allow for the vigilance necessary to pick this stuff up early and to deal with
[48:44.800 --> 48:47.520]  it appropriately and there's gonna be people who come into the ER and they're
[48:47.520 --> 48:50.160]  just gonna be sent home either with antibiotics or you know some treatment
[48:50.160 --> 48:53.040]  for the flu or and and the next thing you know they're gonna go home to their
[48:53.040 --> 48:57.240]  family contaminate them and the cycle will continue but absolutely if this is
[48:57.240 --> 49:01.360]  truly something that now is possibly airborne you're talking a million that
[49:01.360 --> 49:05.720]  could be lost there's no doubt about that thank you so much for the call
[49:05.720 --> 49:09.840]  doctor it's a doctor in Las Vegas calling in we have some footage that came
[49:09.840 --> 49:13.320]  out about a week ago we're gonna repost it to info wars.com because it's so
[49:13.320 --> 49:19.280]  powerful of video in a market an open market in Liberia get of your radio
[49:19.280 --> 49:22.880]  listener go to info wars.com we just posted it minutes ago we're gonna tweet
[49:22.880 --> 49:28.800]  it out at real Alex Jones and it shows a man who they believe has Ebola trying to
[49:28.800 --> 49:35.640]  get food in the market basically wandering around with a club in his hand and
[49:35.640 --> 49:40.760]  people chasing him police chasing him and then the hazmat crew showing up and
[49:40.760 --> 49:45.400]  and rounding him up to taking basically to a medical camp where people are just
[49:45.400 --> 49:49.200]  in many cases strapped down to die now as the medical workers have gotten ill
[49:49.200 --> 49:54.360]  or died themselves this is really the breakdown of society we're gonna roll
[49:54.360 --> 49:58.120]  some of this in the background for TV viewers to see but again you'll want to
[49:58.120 --> 50:06.760]  go to info wars.com to look at it for yourself this is just extremely terrifying
[50:06.760 --> 50:10.960]  footage when you realize that in the human experience there have been black
[50:10.960 --> 50:14.800]  plagues and Spanish flues and you name it in some cases kill a third of the
[50:14.800 --> 50:21.880]  population and it's the civil unrest that's something like this would create
[50:21.880 --> 50:25.960]  and I keep saying this is the season of crises the last year that's just gonna
[50:25.960 --> 50:30.080]  be crazier and crazier we have an open border while this is happening and the
[50:30.080 --> 50:32.560]  politically correct doctors say we're not allowed to talk about it we have
[50:32.560 --> 50:38.080]  airports just wide open meanwhile the IRS and the FBI are busy going after the
[50:38.080 --> 50:42.520]  tea party and harassing people we're gonna go to break and come back with
[50:42.520 --> 50:47.960]  more of your phone calls Chris Eric Matt Tim and others we've got more doctors

[54:17.320 --> 54:27.440]  PBS Nova back in 1990 reported on an airborne outbreak of Ebola PBS nationwide
[54:27.440 --> 54:32.480]  aired this we have documents and mainstream news articles from two years
[54:32.480 --> 54:37.040]  ago that they believe Ebola is becoming airborne there have been different
[54:37.040 --> 54:44.040]  strains that have been before and that it's basically been covered up now
[54:44.040 --> 54:48.360]  again the mainstream media's response was we're lying it's not true we're
[54:48.360 --> 54:56.040]  conspiracy theorist well here it is from Nova PBS 1990 a year after the outbreak
[54:56.040 --> 55:00.680]  reporting on the secret operation and again they will probably have all the
[55:00.680 --> 55:04.560]  usual suspects come out and say none of this is real none of this is happening
[55:04.560 --> 55:11.040]  but of course it is here it is in 1989 Ebola made its way to the US
[55:11.040 --> 55:15.680]  residents of this Washington DC suburb had no idea that one of the world's
[55:15.680 --> 55:20.680]  deadliest viruses had emerged in their midst
[55:24.360 --> 55:30.520]  in a primate quarantine unit in rest in Virginia monkeys in one of the holding
[55:30.520 --> 55:37.360]  rooms suddenly began to die secretly a military team entered the quarantine
[55:37.360 --> 55:42.840]  unit and killed all 60 monkeys in the infected room
[55:50.640 --> 55:57.200]  the crisis heightened as monkeys began to die in a different room it appeared
[55:57.200 --> 56:02.720]  that the virus was moving through the ventilating system in response the
[56:02.720 --> 56:09.840]  military killed all 400 monkeys ending the outbreak this new strain of Ebola
[56:09.840 --> 56:14.600]  had shown the potential to spread through the air had it been lethal in humans
[56:14.600 --> 56:21.760]  it could have been catastrophic okay so that's one that they don't believe
[56:21.760 --> 56:26.600]  humans get now they're saying the type that humans can get two years ago in an
[56:26.600 --> 56:30.920]  African lab was spreading in the air I'm gonna say that again now that's in the
[56:30.920 --> 56:35.680]  precious New York Times something's different this time with the subola and

[01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:33.440]  previous outbreak and we know it's part of this season of craziness and I
[01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:37.440]  predict more craziness now more unprecedented events you can feel it
[01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:47.280]  it's in the air pun intended let's go to Chris in Nevada former EMT them will go

[01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:56.880]  the info wars truth news Central Command station and calling from FEMA zone 9
[01:01:56.880 --> 01:02:05.280]  near Las Vegas Nevada welcome this is absolutely a diabolic deception with a
[01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:12.000]  specially engineered to be tactically deployed as a biocare weapon of mass
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:20.520]  destruction this full spectrum spread or rollout that's the way this
[01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:29.640]  administration rolls to disseminate for a maximum kill rate and depopulation
[01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:36.960]  there was a book several years ago by dr. Judith Mary Baker called dr. Mary's
[01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:42.480]  monkey yes that talked about the centers for the disease creation and
[01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:50.240]  controls secret weaponized disease we sell the book and and she worked in the
[01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:57.000]  bio weapon lab and there was absolutely weaponized cancer all of it well
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:02.800]  recently there was a movie on TV that was very suggestive and on point I think
[01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:07.680]  it was called the immigrant showing seren stone and the line that I recall
[01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:13.600]  specifically from that movie is the best mule is a mule that doesn't know it's a
[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:23.760]  mule ah this is absolutely demonic is what's going on Alex you know you know
[01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:27.120]  this well you notice they've got Alcada running all over the world they've got
[01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:33.120]  open borders the dollar they're starting wars with Russia every number we see just
[01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:37.200]  shows they're just turning all the global meltdowns all the global crisis
[01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:40.960]  loose and I've been saying what's the next shoot a drop I said this months ago
[01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:45.240]  so the bio weapon is a new war well I mean what do you think the next shoot a
[01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:51.040]  drop is a huge terrorist event the US I think it's likely all the above this
[01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:56.680]  group has never done one thing with one purpose it's always multi-faceted in
[01:03:56.680 --> 01:04:01.960]  every scam they put forth on the American public as the domestic terrorist
[01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:07.160]  revolutionary occupation force that are sitting within the government they
[01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:11.960]  always have multiple different aspects to their plans and likely will employ
[01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:16.880]  multiple different asymmetric-styled attacks around the nation in different
[01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:25.440]  locations to get the maximum effect of invoking fear and to the public well I
[01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:31.480]  totally agree with you well look at that headline Ebola AIDS manufactured by
[01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:38.040]  Western pharmaceutical companies USD OD scientists allege wow what is that out

[01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:11.040]  that even now orders are being shouted into telephones and men with guns will
[01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:16.520]  still be on their way it's chances that why because while the truncheon may be
[01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:22.400]  used loo of conversation words will always retain their power words offer
[01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:27.080]  the means to meaning and for those who will listen the annunciation of truth
[01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:32.720]  the truth is there is something terribly wrong with this country isn't that you
[01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:36.080]  decided sir you wanted it foolproof you told me every television in London
[01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:40.840]  cruelty and injustice intolerance and depression and where once you have the
[01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:45.560]  freedom to object the thing can speak as you saw fit you now have sensors and
[01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:49.520]  systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and some cameras your
[01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:54.920]  submachine cameras how did this happen most blame well certainly there are
[01:08:54.920 --> 01:08:59.320]  those who are more responsible than others they will be held accountable but
[01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:04.200]  again truth be told if you're looking for the guilty you need only look into a
[01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:11.600]  mirror I know why you did it I know you were afraid who wouldn't be war terror
[01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:17.680]  disease there were a myriad of problems inspired to corrupt your reason and rub
[01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:22.600]  you of your common sense fear got the best of you and in your panic you turn
[01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:27.720]  to the now high chancellor Adam Sutler he promised you order he promised you
[01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:33.840]  peace and all he demanded in return was your silent to be didn't consent
[01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:44.960]  there is a war it's happening now it will decide the fate of humanity the
[01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:55.600]  time to choose sides has come we are the resistance we are the info war and we
[01:09:55.600 --> 01:10:00.960]  are well into our number two today the reason I wanted to air that V for vendetta
[01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:09.200]  intro is that in the film government uses a bio weapon that they release in
[01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:18.240]  London as the pretext to bring in martial law as the smokescreen for a
[01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:26.080]  totalitarian state and then also the people in the government coup own the
[01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:34.400]  stock in the drug that can save you from the viral release now the reason the
[01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:43.880]  Wachowski brother and sister put that out is because they're aware of problem
[01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:51.600]  reaction solution and so many of the big biological events we've seen the last
[01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:57.360]  hundred years got tracked back to government labs oh the Gates Foundation
[01:10:57.360 --> 01:11:02.600]  has pledged 50 million to fight Ebola how sweet of them when they're eugenicist
[01:11:02.600 --> 01:11:08.760]  who in population reduction and the word from the eugenicist is airborne Ebola
[01:11:08.760 --> 01:11:18.600]  will be what is used to reduce population and bring in world government in fact
[01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:22.920]  guys I want to get for the nightly news tonight or if not for the show tomorrow
[01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:28.040]  I want to get clips from hundred monkeys or 12 monkeys and I want to get clips
[01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:34.080]  from V for vendetta that I can just play so we can illustrate this for people but
[01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:47.760]  more importantly I want to get the video clip on Dr. Eric Pionka the section
[01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:54.240]  on airborne Ebola from my 2007 film endgame blueprint for global enslavement
[01:11:54.240 --> 01:12:02.600]  where we lay all this out because there is a globalist obsession with Ebola and
[01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:07.960]  now we're seeing it pop up in fact we have a nova clip then I'm going to your
[01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:11.600]  phone calls that I aired at the end of the last hour I know some stations only
[01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:16.840]  carry the second and third hour so I want to air that of this piece narrated by
[01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:26.320]  Stacy Keach breaking down an airborne Ebola release in the United States and
[01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:30.680]  similar things have happened in Africa at a monkey research facility now it's
[01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:34.440]  come out that they're not just quote trying to find cures or treatments of
[01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:38.120]  these facilities they're also looking to weaponize it and that's how they get
[01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:45.560]  around the biological weapons treaties how long until this stuff gets out the
[01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:50.960]  foot and mouth outbreak of 2000 in England we said was probably weaponized
[01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:55.760]  probably a government person how do we know it popped up in 20 plus locations
[01:12:55.760 --> 01:13:00.960]  in one day simultaneous same level of infection killed a higher number of the
[01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:04.680]  cows and sheep than naturally occurring foot and mouth did I went look at the
[01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:09.600]  numbers it came out a year later the government whitewash that it was animal
[01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:14.080]  rights activists working in the Ministry of Defense bio weapons area that wanted
[01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:18.920]  to end the domestication of animals who simultaneously released it in 20 plus
[01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:24.580]  places across England Scotland bull bull it was a deliberate attack on the
[01:13:24.580 --> 01:13:28.960]  farming communities and was a bio attack and we analyzed the attack pattern
[01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:37.360]  we accurately on air and at prison planet calm and info wars calm pioneered the
[01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:41.080]  articles understanding that it was government and it was confirmed so all
[01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:45.360]  I'm saying is I've dealt with this for a long time do you know that they did
[01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:49.080]  secret tests that were partially declassified putting pathogens in
[01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:53.440]  hepatitis shots in free clinics for gay men in New York City in the late 70s
[01:13:53.440 --> 01:13:58.280]  right before AIDS popped up you know about Tuskegee and black people all the
[01:13:58.280 --> 01:14:02.880]  rest of it there are thousands look it up of radiating troops nerve-gassing them
[01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:07.480]  shooting troops up with stuff that kills them so the number one suspect any time
[01:14:07.480 --> 01:14:13.000]  this stuff's going on is the criminal eugenesis that run our government 36,000
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:19.680]  top Nazis just like they say in the movie the right stuff they've got great
[01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:22.680]  Germans working on the rocket program our Germans are better than their Germans
[01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:26.560]  the reason our Germans were better than their Germans is most those Germans have
[01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:30.800]  been trained in the West to begin with in England and they were only coming home
[01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:34.960]  that's why we got five to one the Nazis because they didn't want to go with the
[01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:39.920]  Russians and I'm not blaming this on Nazis either it shows the mindset of our
[01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:51.400]  elite they took 36,000 top Nazis engineers rocket scientist Gestapo
[01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:57.760]  Klaus Barbie you name it to run everything it's got to be half the new
[01:14:57.760 --> 01:15:03.640]  university research facilities from 1946 on are named after Nazis the Goddard
[01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:08.840]  Space Center the Werner von Braun rocket propulsion lab you know on and on and
[01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:16.720]  on and on and on and on and on and on and on we got the Plum Island
[01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:21.680]  shifilis weaponized Lyme's disease just changed the name like you change
[01:15:21.680 --> 01:15:26.920]  al-qaeda to ISIS from the Plum Island facility who ran the Plum Island
[01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:35.720]  facility from 1946 until 1972 look it up just search Nazi scientist ran Plum
[01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:42.640]  Island you'll get his name the whole thing it's public it's declassified so
[01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:45.920]  when I get up here and I say I think this this a ball is weaponized I think
[01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:49.200]  this a ball is starting to go airborne now you see it in the New York Times
[01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:55.520]  because anybody who actually researches can see something is wrong here and we're
[01:15:55.520 --> 01:15:59.800]  told calm down let it spread don't people get ready for it that's why they
[01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:04.480]  slapped me down five weeks ago shut up in full wars shut up drudge don't warn
[01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:07.600]  people don't say this could be dangerous don't say you should get ready
[01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:11.120]  there is New York Post behind the secret plan to bring Nazi scientists the US
[01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:14.960]  yeah yeah I mean I mean that's part of that but operation paper clip and others
[01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:20.200]  in the rat line pull up Nazi scientist ran Plum Island it'll be like
[01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:26.520]  associated press it was declassified in the 90s okay I said I'd go to your
[01:16:26.520 --> 01:16:32.680]  phone calls all I know is this is a lot worse than they said it was and they're
[01:16:32.680 --> 01:16:35.880]  bringing people here that have Ebola so they can have plausible deniability when
[01:16:35.880 --> 01:16:39.560]  it gets out and only public pressure pointing out the globalist could be
[01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:46.080]  behind this or certainly are to blame if it gets out now may make them stop it
[01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:49.160]  but if they think they'll get away with it just like they're doing arming ISIS
[01:16:49.160 --> 01:16:52.680]  right now to fight ISIS they'll do it they found a headline there I'll give it
[01:16:52.680 --> 01:16:57.720]  to you did Lyme's disease originated out of Plum Island well they can debate
[01:16:57.720 --> 01:17:00.920]  that even though it's not up for debate that it's weaponized the point is is
[01:17:00.920 --> 01:17:03.880]  that a Nazi scientist ran it you can look it up there have been mainstream
[01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:11.560]  television programs on the subject and now the daily observer by Dr. Cyril
[01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:16.320]  Broderick who I want to get on the show guys Ebola AIDS manufactured by Western
[01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:27.760]  pharmaceuticals USD OD dear world citizens I read a number of articles from
[01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:30.640]  your internet outreach as well as articles from other sources about the
[01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:34.280]  casualties in Liberia and other West African countries and about the human
[01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:39.600]  devastation caused by Ebola virus by a week ago I read an article published in
[01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:44.840]  summary of the Friends of Liberia that said there was an agreement that the
[01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:49.400]  initiation of the old outbreak in West Africa was due to the contact of a two
[01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:56.280]  year old child with bats that had flown in from the Congo that report made me
[01:17:56.280 --> 01:18:04.200]  disconcerted with the reporting about Ebola and its simulation a response the
[01:18:04.200 --> 01:18:08.640]  Friends of Liberia saying that African people are not ignorant and gullible as
[01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:14.480]  is being implicated and then it just goes on to break it down number one Ebola is
[01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:19.160]  genetically modified organism GMO and he breaks down some of the studies on
[01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:23.280]  that front number two Ebola has a terrible history and testing has been
[01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:28.200]  secretly taking place in Africa that's been declassified number three sites
[01:18:28.200 --> 01:18:33.960]  around Africa and in the West Africa have over the years been set up for
[01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:37.720]  testing emerging diseases especially Ebola and then he links to all the
[01:18:37.720 --> 01:18:42.720]  bibliographed admissions of it which I'm aware of so it's a very good article
[01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:47.640]  Professor Broderick is a former professor of plant biology University of
[01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:52.880]  Liberia's College of Agriculture and Forestry he's also former observer farmer
[01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:59.160]  in 1980s it was from this column in our newspaper The Daily Observer that
[01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:03.000]  Firestone spotted him and offered in the position of director of research in the
[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:07.000]  1980s in addition he is a scientist who was taught for many years in
[01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:11.320]  agriculture college of the University of Delaware so let's look into him and get
[01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:16.760]  him on because I don't know who he is but I know I've seen mainstream news
[01:19:16.760 --> 01:19:21.920]  articles and documents and admissions on everything that was said right there and
[01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:29.240]  we come back I'm gonna play the clip of 1990 Nova talking about airborne Ebola
[01:19:29.240 --> 01:19:34.000]  in a secret lab in the United States and what happened there because that's my
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:37.760]  point even if they're not releasing this on purpose they can't contain it
[01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:41.720]  government can't do anything right what are they doing with all these
[01:19:41.720 --> 01:19:48.400]  facilities what are they doing bringing Ebola patients in to University medical
[01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:52.880]  hospitals well we have the wing blocked off for the Ebola patients I don't care
[01:19:52.880 --> 01:20:00.320]  keep them on ships that was always the policy before what is going on here my

[01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:14.960]  a list of joined us just so you know there's a lot of weapons labs playing
[01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:21.680]  with Ebola all over the world especially Africa here's a clip from 1990 from
[01:24:21.680 --> 01:24:28.720]  Nova narrated by Stacy Keach breaking down what happened at a US lab and these
[01:24:28.720 --> 01:24:36.280]  things are all over the place in 1989 Ebola made its way to the US
[01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:41.320]  residents of this Washington DC suburb had no idea that one of the world's
[01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:46.280]  deadliest viruses had emerged in their midst
[01:24:49.920 --> 01:24:55.680]  in a primate quarantine unit in rest in Virginia monkeys and one of the
[01:24:55.680 --> 01:25:02.320]  holding rooms suddenly began to die secretly a military team entered the
[01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:08.400]  quarantine unit and killed all 60 monkeys in the infected room
[01:25:16.240 --> 01:25:22.760]  the crisis heightened as monkeys began to die in a different room it appeared
[01:25:22.760 --> 01:25:28.280]  that the virus was moving through the ventilating system in response the
[01:25:28.280 --> 01:25:35.400]  military killed all 400 monkeys ending the outbreak this new strain of Ebola
[01:25:35.400 --> 01:25:40.160]  had shown the potential to spread through the air had it been lethal in humans
[01:25:40.160 --> 01:25:45.320]  it could have been catastrophic and now the New York Times last Friday
[01:25:45.320 --> 01:25:49.880]  reporting what we told you over a month ago is saying that there is a lot of
[01:25:49.880 --> 01:25:54.560]  medical evidence that it's becoming airborne what we are all afraid to say
[01:25:54.560 --> 01:26:01.080]  about Ebola was the headline regardless it's it's found legs it's
[01:26:01.080 --> 01:26:05.720]  spreading rapidly top scientists are saying it'll kill five million
[01:26:05.720 --> 01:26:09.760]  meanwhile our government saying a hundred thousand might get it fifty
[01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:14.360]  thousand eighty thousand might die we're not being told the truth here now
[01:26:14.360 --> 01:26:17.600]  this is a short segment I want to get through all your calls eight hundred two
[01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:22.160]  five nine ninety thirty one I'm gonna go to each caller quickly now why it in

[01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:39.760]  there okay let's go to Eric in Minnesota go ahead you're so you're becoming a
[01:26:39.760 --> 01:26:45.600]  doctor what's your take on all this yeah I may be having a problem with the phone
[01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:50.160]  systems at GCN or something I got a second call I can't get audio on caller
[01:26:50.160 --> 01:26:55.880]  can you hear me yes I can they go ahead hey how you doing Alex I'm just a few
[01:26:55.880 --> 01:26:59.720]  quick points I wanted to make about what we've been being told and what's
[01:26:59.720 --> 01:27:05.840]  supposedly going on no supposedly the incubation period is two to 22 days
[01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:11.040]  currently so someone could actually have it for 22 days before they even
[01:27:11.040 --> 01:27:18.000]  develop any symptoms they're saying it's mutated over 250 times so far in the
[01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:22.320]  last three months and I kind of wanted to go with the immunity discussion on this
[01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:29.440]  as well stem cells are what we call hemocytoblast they develop in the bone
[01:27:29.440 --> 01:27:35.080]  marrow and B cells go to the thymus where they mature and this develops our
[01:27:35.080 --> 01:27:40.480]  antibodies and what they're saying right now is you can use the blood of people
[01:27:40.480 --> 01:27:45.960]  who have recovered to treat people and it's partially true you can use the
[01:27:45.960 --> 01:27:50.680]  blood and their antibodies will work but the thing they're not telling anyone is
[01:27:50.680 --> 01:27:56.520]  that it won't make anyone immune you would have to continue taking the blood
[01:27:57.240 --> 01:28:02.480]  interesting so so as soon as those antibodies run out the virus continues
[01:28:02.480 --> 01:28:08.040]  to regenerate correct I mean you could become cured of but you won't become
[01:28:08.040 --> 01:28:12.440]  immune if you were exposed to it again what are the theories what are the
[01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:16.120]  theories around the medical people about why it's so much worse this time and
[01:28:16.120 --> 01:28:24.800]  how bad it really is I haven't heard too many theories about that yet it is
[01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:29.080]  strange how it started this time where the vector was actually in a large city
[01:28:29.080 --> 01:28:35.760]  instead of a small rural farming type population in the country so it's kind
[01:28:35.760 --> 01:28:39.200]  of spreading backwards which makes you think something else might be going on
[01:28:39.200 --> 01:28:43.160]  here what do you think about this top German virologist that heads up one of
[01:28:43.160 --> 01:28:46.240]  the most respected virologist facilities in the world Friday coming out and
[01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:52.800]  saying it's really gonna be five million that are gonna die well if it came into
[01:28:52.800 --> 01:28:56.920]  the United States I mean people here really are not educated on things like
[01:28:56.920 --> 01:29:02.600]  this for instance the safety precautions there's usually four that we use we use
[01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:08.960]  standard precaution airborne precaution droplet precaution and contact
[01:29:08.960 --> 01:29:12.800]  precaution right now they're telling us it's in the droplet precaution stage
[01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:18.760]  where it can spread three to five feet in saliva mucous membranes etc but who
[01:29:18.760 --> 01:29:22.840]  knows if that could spread further but I mean even the nurses and doctors and a
[01:29:22.840 --> 01:29:27.240]  lot of hospitals don't use proper precautions when they're dealing with
[01:29:27.240 --> 01:29:31.280]  patients imagine the bowl of getting into these hospitals with these super
[01:29:31.280 --> 01:29:34.920]  viruses in them who knows what could happen with that and of course Africans
[01:29:34.920 --> 01:29:38.680]  have been around these type of viruses for a long time they've got some herd
[01:29:38.680 --> 01:29:42.920]  immunity I guess they would call them a doctor but just imagine if it gets into
[01:29:42.920 --> 01:29:47.520]  the West it'll be like smallpox to the Indians incredible thank you so much for

[01:34:17.200 --> 01:34:29.160]  regardless of what's behind this it is a major major epidemic in africa i guess
[01:34:29.160 --> 01:34:33.560]  you'd call it pandemic and you've heard the medical doctors calling in i've
[01:34:33.560 --> 01:34:36.720]  been reading what medical doctors say what virologists say and the more
[01:34:36.720 --> 01:34:43.480]  prestigious they get the more dire their statements i mean this was in build
[01:34:43.480 --> 01:34:49.160]  last friday virologist it's too late abola will kill five million experts as
[01:34:49.160 --> 01:34:54.400]  virus will infect entire population of african countries a top german
[01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:58.720]  virologist has caused shockwaves by asserting that it's too late to halt the
[01:34:58.720 --> 01:35:02.800]  spread of abola and serralliano and iberia that five million people will die
[01:35:02.800 --> 01:35:06.560]  noting that efforts should now be focused on stopping the transmission of
[01:35:06.560 --> 01:35:10.840]  the virus to other countries and i agree with that statement what are we doing
[01:35:10.840 --> 01:35:17.320]  bringing people with abola into these countries what what our major passenger
[01:35:17.320 --> 01:35:25.240]  aircraft doing flying in to western africa remember how when h1n1 was out
[01:35:25.240 --> 01:35:29.480]  it was a super weak flu and came out was a quote stimulant from the year before
[01:35:29.480 --> 01:35:35.680]  to track viral spread a quote weakened virus it was just all the fair mongering
[01:35:35.680 --> 01:35:40.720]  i was in a restaurant this morning having a couple eggs at a diner before i came
[01:35:40.720 --> 01:35:45.640]  to work at about nine thirty and there were these two older couples sitting
[01:35:45.640 --> 01:35:48.840]  right next to me and they saw some lady who had a stroke come about a news they
[01:35:48.840 --> 01:35:53.880]  talked to her and they said get your flu shot and then i sat there and listened
[01:35:53.880 --> 01:35:57.560]  to these 65 70 year old people about all their health problems but how they were
[01:35:57.560 --> 01:36:00.360]  going to get their flu shots as soon as they were available how they got them
[01:36:00.360 --> 01:36:05.040]  every year and there i was knowing the studies main line that three flu shots
[01:36:05.040 --> 01:36:09.560]  doubles your chances of Alzheimer's and i can just see the Alzheimer graphs in
[01:36:09.560 --> 01:36:15.000]  my head going straight up and how it causes neurological disorders and how
[01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:22.240]  it causes problems with blood flow and causes autoimmune responses in the
[01:36:22.240 --> 01:36:26.640]  ventricles of the heart because i know this stuff and all the sudden they
[01:36:26.640 --> 01:36:31.280]  start listing all their illnesses yeah i've got this problem with my ventricles
[01:36:31.280 --> 01:36:36.960]  and i'm got a neurological disorder now and they're all with their iPhones they
[01:36:36.960 --> 01:36:41.040]  all had iPhones not not droids and we're all for 30 minutes ruining my
[01:36:41.040 --> 01:36:45.440]  breakfast shitting right next to me at the diner
[01:36:47.480 --> 01:36:52.520]  dan's hamburgers they have breakfast there and it's an old-fashioned diner
[01:36:52.520 --> 01:36:57.320]  and so it's diner chairs where you're like right up next to their booth and i'm
[01:36:57.320 --> 01:37:02.640]  in a single person booth right next to them listening to them and and their
[01:37:02.640 --> 01:37:08.400]  hands were shaking they were all soft killed they were all just wrecks of the
[01:37:08.400 --> 01:37:12.920]  medical system and all they were doing was talking about their doctors and i
[01:37:12.920 --> 01:37:17.280]  know they've never guessed the right flu shot for the next year they admit that
[01:37:17.280 --> 01:37:23.360]  the right mutation i know it doubles your chances of Alzheimer's i know the
[01:37:23.360 --> 01:37:27.840]  canadian study five years ago found that taking the h1n1 vaccine the swine flu
[01:37:27.840 --> 01:37:31.560]  vaccine doubled your chances of getting flu the next year lowering your immune
[01:37:31.560 --> 01:37:36.280]  system by 50 percent on and on and on i know it says on the insert geon beret
[01:37:36.280 --> 01:37:43.320]  narcolepsy neurological disorders epilepsy cancer miscarriage i know what
[01:37:43.320 --> 01:37:48.720]  it says and here comes their friend hobbling by look like she was about 65
[01:37:48.720 --> 01:38:00.760]  on a walker has had a stroke and they're in there eating breakfast and i'm just
[01:38:00.760 --> 01:38:05.080]  sitting there wanting to warn them and i just looked over at them and i knew they
[01:38:05.080 --> 01:38:10.120]  weren't gonna listen to a word i told them and it's not like i'm some health
[01:38:10.120 --> 01:38:15.080]  nut i didn't believe when i go to your calls that they didn't even let me live
[01:38:15.080 --> 01:38:17.960]  this long back when i was getting death-threaded and physically attacked
[01:38:17.960 --> 01:38:22.720]  everything else you could imagine 15 16 years ago so i just stopped jogging every
[01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:25.960]  other day stopped lifting weights almost every day just started working like 18
[01:38:25.960 --> 01:38:30.920]  hours a day wrecking my body gaining almost 100 pounds from 185 pounds to
[01:38:30.920 --> 01:38:39.640]  you know 275 pounds i have lost 50 now but i got another 20 or 30 to go and
[01:38:39.640 --> 01:38:44.760]  tommy pull out of them we just emailed me to the downer called me i need to he
[01:38:44.760 --> 01:38:48.160]  texted me and called me to give him a call always listen hollywood producer i
[01:38:48.160 --> 01:38:53.240]  know we were out bike riding and he said man he's being really good shape he
[01:38:53.240 --> 01:38:57.560]  goes you're a wreck he said they're already killing you by you believing you
[01:38:57.560 --> 01:39:01.800]  don't have a life you're gonna kill yourself it's not enough to go on a
[01:39:01.800 --> 01:39:05.640]  bike ride once a week for five miles you need to start jogging you need to stop
[01:39:05.640 --> 01:39:09.560]  smoking because i was smoking some then hanging around you know radio guys most
[01:39:09.560 --> 01:39:14.360]  of them smoke i just taken all these horrible habits and and and so that was
[01:39:14.360 --> 01:39:19.480]  about six years ago and it's taken me six years after i wrecked myself to give
[01:39:19.480 --> 01:39:23.320]  the point i am now and now that i had three family members die and look the
[01:39:23.320 --> 01:39:27.800]  best pitch is something that's true i really believe when i'm saying right
[01:39:27.800 --> 01:39:32.120]  now and i know what to be true when i saw three of my family members who were
[01:39:32.120 --> 01:39:37.560]  in pretty good shape especially my uncle i mean he was like a barrel chest and
[01:39:37.560 --> 01:39:42.280]  big arms and played football at lsu and you know ate healthy and everything
[01:39:42.280 --> 01:39:48.600]  but it killed his son he was taking care of him then it killed him
[01:39:48.600 --> 01:39:51.880]  of course killed my grand uncle before that but he was in bad shape but they
[01:39:51.880 --> 01:39:55.320]  were all taken care of each other that's the chain reaction best we can tell
[01:39:55.320 --> 01:39:59.080]  from a hospital-born illness that ended up getting into my family
[01:39:59.080 --> 01:40:02.920]  so what did i begin to do i went whoa i better go to the next level
[01:40:02.920 --> 01:40:05.880]  i'm taking colloidal silver all the time now i'm not telling you do that i'm
[01:40:05.880 --> 01:40:08.680]  telling you what i'm doing i am taking super levels of
[01:40:08.680 --> 01:40:13.720]  vitamin c i'm flushing my guts out uh with oxy powder and other things
[01:40:13.720 --> 01:40:17.960]  i'm taking the iodine religiously i have never religiously taken these
[01:40:17.960 --> 01:40:20.840]  supplements because i've never did it my whole life but now the last few years i
[01:40:20.840 --> 01:40:23.400]  get better and better about it you know a few times a week i'll take the
[01:40:23.400 --> 01:40:27.080]  supplements no now i'm taking them seven days a week
[01:40:27.080 --> 01:40:30.360]  every time i'm supposed to take them i'm taking the occupier
[01:40:30.360 --> 01:40:34.600]  i'm taking the oxy powder i'm taking the x2 nascent iodine
[01:40:34.600 --> 01:40:39.400]  and despite the fact that i still don't eat the best food and i still work late
[01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:43.400]  and you know still take care of three kids and all the rest of it
[01:40:43.400 --> 01:40:47.080]  it has been revolutionary what it's done for my family and myself
[01:40:47.080 --> 01:40:50.760]  so i challenge you support the broadcast get the survival shield get the
[01:40:50.760 --> 01:40:54.760]  survival shield x2 which is a lot stronger i recommend

[01:40:57.480 --> 01:41:00.280]  because when i talk to doctor group but also medical doctors and others they
[01:41:00.280 --> 01:41:02.600]  say oh you got to have the good halogen iodine you
[01:41:02.600 --> 01:41:06.680]  got to have vitamin c you got to have pure water you got to have clean guts
[01:41:06.680 --> 01:41:10.680]  you got to be in a good mood you got to have a positive outlook
[01:41:10.680 --> 01:41:13.640]  being positive and believing there's a good future coming
[01:41:13.640 --> 01:41:17.320]  is despite all this bad stuff happening we don't need to get stressed out by the
[01:41:17.320 --> 01:41:21.240]  Ebola we need to get prepared so i've been researching how do you
[01:41:21.240 --> 01:41:24.920]  survive a pandemic whether it's Ebola which i don't think
[01:41:24.920 --> 01:41:27.640]  is going to come over here and get really bad i pray but i feel so bad for
[01:41:27.640 --> 01:41:31.320]  Africa and other areas let's just hope but it could get worse
[01:41:31.320 --> 01:41:35.480]  my tell me i'm starting to get scared for my family
[01:41:35.480 --> 01:41:40.120]  but everybody i know is losing people from hospital-born illnesses or you go
[01:41:40.120 --> 01:41:42.840]  in to get your larynx worked on and you're dead
[01:41:42.840 --> 01:41:47.320]  Joan Rivers most people i know that die don't die in car wrecks or cancer
[01:41:47.320 --> 01:41:50.280]  or heart attacks they die going to the hospital to have their bunion
[01:41:50.280 --> 01:41:54.040]  worked on or to have their slip disc worked on or to have i mean i just
[01:41:54.040 --> 01:41:57.400]  almost everybody i know that's died has died in the hospital
[01:41:57.400 --> 01:42:01.160]  going to have a routine procedure done
[01:42:03.720 --> 01:42:07.720]  there's a lot of deadly bacteria and stuff out there now and so all i'm
[01:42:07.720 --> 01:42:12.200]  saying is we got to be positive we got to love each other we got to be upbeat
[01:42:12.200 --> 01:42:14.920]  but also be prepared that's what your brain wants you to do
[01:42:14.920 --> 01:42:18.360]  because if you're upbeat and positive but face the problems your brain goes
[01:42:18.360 --> 01:42:21.720]  hey i'm looking for things i'm on top of things i'm positive it boosts your
[01:42:21.720 --> 01:42:24.920]  immune system they've got the studies they know how to deal with it
[01:42:24.920 --> 01:42:29.400]  clean water get all the trace elements and minerals you need
[01:42:29.400 --> 01:42:37.960]  clean out your guts don't eat GMO and you do that and you will have a jump
[01:42:37.960 --> 01:42:41.560]  and it doesn't mean any you're perfect you don't sometimes eat the wrong thing
[01:42:41.560 --> 01:42:44.600]  it just means you start cutting it out i look at how much i've changed my
[01:42:44.600 --> 01:42:47.720]  lifestyle for i used to eat hamburgers at least
[01:42:47.720 --> 01:42:52.120]  once a day for 10 years now i eat a hamburger maybe once a week
[01:42:52.120 --> 01:42:55.160]  um i look at how i used to eat chicken fried steaks
[01:42:55.160 --> 01:42:58.680]  every week now i eat them once a year literally
[01:42:58.680 --> 01:43:02.040]  you know if grandma makes it
[01:43:02.520 --> 01:43:05.720]  we've just all got to incrementally change our lifestyle
[01:43:05.720 --> 01:43:09.720]  and get geared up because you can see the numbers of what's happening
[01:43:09.720 --> 01:43:12.680]  so info wars life.com i think is a great place to start
[01:43:12.680 --> 01:43:17.080]  it's where i start the oxy powder the x2 the supermail vitality that gets your
[01:43:17.080 --> 01:43:19.960]  lands going info wars life.com and then you can
[01:43:19.960 --> 01:43:23.720]  also rest assured your purchase is going towards funding this operation
[01:43:23.720 --> 01:43:27.560]  to get more great reporters to be able to send more crew out to break the big
[01:43:27.560 --> 01:43:30.760]  stories and defend the republic info wars life.com or
[01:43:30.760 --> 01:43:34.840]  888-253-3139 all right i'm gonna go quick now to
[01:43:34.840 --> 01:43:39.800]  Eric and to Barbara and Sean and Bob and Jay and others
[01:43:39.800 --> 01:43:43.160]  Eric thanks for calling in uh what is your take on
[01:43:43.160 --> 01:43:49.640]  abola isis you name it um i got a stadium
[01:43:49.640 --> 01:43:52.120]  yeah i'm sorry your phone's breaking up bro i'm gonna come back to you in a
[01:43:52.120 --> 01:43:55.080]  moment when you get closer to your wherever it
[01:43:55.080 --> 01:43:59.880]  works Sean in new mexico go ahead yeah i hope
[01:43:59.880 --> 01:44:03.400]  yeah go ahead yeah so here's a thought about
[01:44:03.400 --> 01:44:08.520]  how abola is being transmitted and that would be
[01:44:08.520 --> 01:44:12.600]  by uh mosquitoes fleas and flies you know
[01:44:12.600 --> 01:44:15.400]  it's like there's another way it could be transmitted
[01:44:15.400 --> 01:44:19.080]  oh i hadn't even thought of that because i keep saying it's from monkeys or from
[01:44:19.080 --> 01:44:22.600]  bats that fly over and some of their spit or
[01:44:22.600 --> 01:44:25.880]  whatever gets in your eye or your nose or your mouth
[01:44:25.880 --> 01:44:30.760]  but yeah i mean if a flea bites somebody that has it and then bites you
[01:44:30.760 --> 01:44:33.480]  they're carrying it inside the blood that would be
[01:44:33.480 --> 01:44:37.160]  transmittable guys look into that is abola transmittable by
[01:44:37.160 --> 01:44:41.080]  by insect yeah or even flies if they land
[01:44:41.080 --> 01:44:44.120]  on a carcass and then land on your food or you know
[01:44:44.120 --> 01:44:48.680]  something like that well what does your gut tell you about all this
[01:44:48.680 --> 01:44:51.560]  i don't know just hit me this morning when i was
[01:44:51.560 --> 01:44:54.520]  woke up this morning
[01:44:55.400 --> 01:44:58.760]  well some virologists that are highly respected say five million are gonna die
[01:44:58.760 --> 01:45:02.520]  others say a couple hundred thousand some say as little as fifty thousand
[01:45:02.520 --> 01:45:06.600]  do you think this is high or do you think this is serious
[01:45:06.600 --> 01:45:09.560]  no i think it's serious but i don't think it's gonna
[01:45:09.560 --> 01:45:13.160]  be as bad here if it's the states i think it's
[01:45:13.160 --> 01:45:16.920]  i think it's gonna be uh you know like it is here
[01:45:16.920 --> 01:45:19.880]  i mean like it isn't africa it's gonna be far worse
[01:45:19.880 --> 01:45:25.640]  sure well the web mds and others do say that among the suspected transmitters
[01:45:25.640 --> 01:45:31.480]  of it encyclopedia britannica says uh is
[01:45:31.480 --> 01:45:35.720]  abola can be transmitted by bats primates rodents insects
[01:45:35.720 --> 01:45:39.480]  that inhabit tropical forests in africa and asia
[01:45:39.480 --> 01:45:45.080]  so there you go um i just hope that it doesn't get to texas or some place
[01:45:45.080 --> 01:45:48.280]  that's hot and balmy like austin is right now
[01:45:48.280 --> 01:45:51.720]  austin's like a rainforest right now it's been raining one day it's a hundred the
[01:45:51.720 --> 01:45:54.520]  next day it's 60 uh so we'll see what happens i
[01:45:54.520 --> 01:45:58.040]  appreciate your call but it's a time bomb
[01:45:58.040 --> 01:46:02.040]  it's the flesh eating bacteria and the mercer and the drug resistant this and
[01:46:02.040 --> 01:46:05.240]  the drug resistant that
[01:46:06.280 --> 01:46:12.120]  every month or so somebody i know goes in for a minor surgery and gets a
[01:46:12.120 --> 01:46:15.640]  hospital transmitted illness and gets their leg chopped off their arm chopped
[01:46:15.640 --> 01:46:19.400]  off but most of the time that they just die
[01:46:19.400 --> 01:46:22.920]  but because it's the medical system that's so infected
[01:46:22.920 --> 01:46:29.160]  and in such a crisis they just cover it up and so it's not a big news issue
[01:46:30.040 --> 01:46:35.960]  and that's that's another big point if it starts spreading will we even get told
[01:46:35.960 --> 01:46:40.520]  if they start finding abola because you know the hospitals have to report to the
[01:46:40.520 --> 01:46:43.960]  cdc and i guarantee you the cdc isn't gonna want to panic or say don't tell
[01:46:43.960 --> 01:46:49.720]  anybody that a truck's gonna show up where are those people gonna be taken
[01:46:49.720 --> 01:46:53.560]  we know the procedure under the executive orders this is just disappear
[01:46:53.560 --> 01:46:57.480]  people there's a cnn whitewash one in 25
[01:46:57.480 --> 01:47:00.920]  patients get infection in hospital that's a lot worse than that
[01:47:00.920 --> 01:47:04.680]  and that's why my dad says go to a private clinic
[01:47:04.680 --> 01:47:07.960]  a newer private clinic that doesn't have sick people in it
[01:47:07.960 --> 01:47:11.800]  that has elective patient care elect but
[01:47:11.800 --> 01:47:18.360]  even jone rivers was in an elective facility she didn't die of a
[01:47:18.360 --> 01:47:21.720]  airborne illness she died when they were doing the surgery they think from
[01:47:21.720 --> 01:47:26.440]  touching on her larynx and it closing up on her suffocating
[01:47:27.640 --> 01:47:31.320]  jay in illinois thanks for calling you're on the air you're a hazmat tech you
[01:47:31.320 --> 01:47:34.920]  say uh what do you think about all this uh well
[01:47:34.920 --> 01:47:39.160]  you know like i said uh talking about nutrition uh is one of the main things i
[01:47:39.160 --> 01:47:43.320]  think you know we need to be concerned with and then also
[01:47:43.320 --> 01:47:47.720]  respiratory protection i mean if this is uh indeed
[01:47:47.720 --> 01:47:53.160]  gonna spread uh through the air then you know the normal person needs to be
[01:47:53.160 --> 01:47:58.920]  able to protect against that and there's some things you can do for that
[01:47:58.920 --> 01:48:03.400]  well if you're an expert in that i mean how good is just a paper mask
[01:48:03.400 --> 01:48:07.720]  uh not good at all you know for you need something that covers up your whole
[01:48:07.720 --> 01:48:11.560]  face don't you to cover your eyes up yes well you need you need
[01:48:11.560 --> 01:48:16.120]  some form of eye protection but then also uh you know for my family and i
[01:48:16.120 --> 01:48:21.880]  uh i went out and uh secured the highest level of protection that you can
[01:48:21.880 --> 01:48:25.560]  just buy you know over the counter the the p100s
[01:48:25.560 --> 01:48:29.080]  are are the highest level protection you can buy over the counter that's a
[01:48:29.080 --> 01:48:33.320]  filtered air you know type of type of mask um
[01:48:33.320 --> 01:48:37.640]  the cdc sent out a uh email a couple weeks ago
[01:48:37.640 --> 01:48:41.640]  you know to the first responders uh saying that they recommended at least an
[01:48:41.640 --> 01:48:47.080]  n95 an n95 is just your basic you know dust mask
[01:48:47.080 --> 01:48:51.000]  and would not protect against uh something that's airborne
[01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:55.720]  you want to research that out uh there's various levels that you can purchase
[01:48:55.720 --> 01:49:00.280]  um n or p p is the highest level protection
[01:49:00.280 --> 01:49:05.160]  and does protect you against viruses
[01:49:05.160 --> 01:49:09.320]  how often do you have to change the filter though uh the p is the highest
[01:49:09.320 --> 01:49:12.760]  level um n is just you know hours of protection
[01:49:12.760 --> 01:49:17.640]  r is like an eight hour protection this is all nyah nyosh recommended
[01:49:17.640 --> 01:49:21.480]  um the p is your highest level protection you can get i believe it's rated up to
[01:49:21.480 --> 01:49:26.760]  at least 40 hours of like an eight hour you know eight hour day five days a week
[01:49:26.760 --> 01:49:30.760]  um obviously you know if you're sure well what i've gone
[01:49:30.760 --> 01:49:34.520]  i've actually got now that you say the name of it i bought years ago p100s
[01:49:34.520 --> 01:49:38.360]  with the whole plastic face mask and the whole nine yards plus you want that
[01:49:38.360 --> 01:49:41.640]  when you're out operating uh you know trying to get out of town or whatever

[01:49:45.160 --> 01:49:48.280]  you know because look let's face it there's no telling what the
[01:49:48.280 --> 01:49:51.640]  globalists could pull down the road they could have drones flying around spraying
[01:49:51.640 --> 01:49:54.440]  this stuff i mean i hate to talk like that but you can see

[01:56:40.040 --> 01:56:43.080]  it came out the syrian government was actually looking at your website
[01:56:43.080 --> 01:56:46.360]  yes if you do in the comment at all but have you ever been contacted by any
[01:56:46.360 --> 01:56:50.280]  governments about information like to maybe consult with you guys or ask
[01:56:50.280 --> 01:56:52.520]  where you're getting your information from
[01:56:52.520 --> 01:56:55.720]  not in a bad way but i mean in a good way i mean i've had members of the
[01:56:55.720 --> 01:56:58.680]  german government on its guests japanese government
[01:56:58.680 --> 01:57:02.360]  u.s government i've had members of parliament members of congress

[01:57:13.560 --> 01:57:18.120]  uh you know to go on like foreign television stations that are state run
[01:57:18.120 --> 01:57:21.880]  i've been on russian state run i've been on um
[01:57:21.880 --> 01:57:25.400]  i've been on like a south american state run media as well
[01:57:25.400 --> 01:57:31.560]  it came out in the london telegraph that they hacked the sod's emails
[01:57:31.560 --> 01:57:35.240]  and that they were mentioning info wars dot com and our analysis

[01:57:47.240 --> 01:57:50.520]  we just tend to say stuff before other people do
[01:57:50.520 --> 01:57:54.520]  and before it's confirmed like the fear that obolos beginning to become
[01:57:54.520 --> 01:57:58.920]  partially airborne or more resistant doesn't mean it's fully airborne
[01:57:58.920 --> 01:58:03.720]  that's now in the new york times so it's just that people listen to us because
[01:58:03.720 --> 01:58:08.360]  a lot of the stuff sensational it's because reality is sensational
[01:58:08.360 --> 01:58:16.040]  but no i don't talk to um clearly years ago if i was in new york city or

[01:58:31.240 --> 01:58:34.440]  contacted by foreign governments does that answer your question

[02:00:25.720 --> 02:00:29.320]  bob was asking a very important question have i ever been contacted by foreign
[02:00:29.320 --> 02:00:33.960]  governments and ask where i got information and the
[02:00:33.960 --> 02:00:40.440]  answer is not really but i did once since he said that
[02:00:40.440 --> 02:00:44.600]  the official iranian government they do this with a bunch of journalists
[02:00:44.600 --> 02:00:48.760]  invited to pay for me to go to tay ron
[02:00:48.760 --> 02:00:53.160]  and meet with ockmede energy and of course i said no
[02:00:53.160 --> 02:00:56.840]  i mean do you imagine the propaganda value they would have
[02:00:56.840 --> 02:01:00.680]  showing that uh a lot of people go because they think it's like a big shot
[02:01:00.680 --> 02:01:05.160]  thing and no it's the optics of stuff like that they
[02:01:05.160 --> 02:01:08.680]  can act like you're disloyal or something i'm completely loyal to the
[02:01:08.680 --> 02:01:12.600]  republic and the ideas of it i'm against the foreign banks that
[02:01:12.600 --> 02:01:16.760]  launder the drug money that are involved in so much corruption that run
[02:01:16.760 --> 02:01:21.160]  our government that's the foreign occupying force
[02:01:21.160 --> 02:01:26.760]  that i'm trying to throw out uh so i'm allied with anybody who promotes
[02:01:26.760 --> 02:01:30.600]  liberty and freedom but if you start getting key
[02:01:30.600 --> 02:01:35.720]  information from sources and then giving it to state run
[02:01:35.720 --> 02:01:39.320]  media of another power or whatever that's just serving another bad master
[02:01:39.320 --> 02:01:42.280]  i don't serve the occupied government i don't serve the russians i don't serve
[02:01:42.280 --> 02:01:45.960]  the vatican i don't serve israel i don't serve
[02:01:45.960 --> 02:01:49.560]  you know the blood drinking lizards of minx sarcastic none of it i serve liberty
[02:01:49.560 --> 02:01:53.560]  and freedom and trying to be a good person in promoting that
[02:01:53.560 --> 02:01:57.560]  but now you can get into all sorts of stuff
[02:01:57.560 --> 02:02:02.360]  as a journalist even communicating with or anything in fact a lot of times i
[02:02:02.360 --> 02:02:06.760]  already know what's going on a lot of times over the years i've been
[02:02:06.760 --> 02:02:09.880]  said stuff that i'm just sticking a shredder throw away because i don't know
[02:02:09.880 --> 02:02:13.720]  if it's real or not it can't be vetted i mean you get a secret document
[02:02:13.720 --> 02:02:16.280]  saying the veterans of the number one terror threat we broke that of course
[02:02:16.280 --> 02:02:20.120]  six years ago well i called the fbi phone number

[02:02:31.480 --> 02:02:33.880]  who gave that to you and i said i'm not going to tell you that i don't know who
[02:02:33.880 --> 02:02:36.680]  gave it to me but okay i can see the southern barbie law
[02:02:36.680 --> 02:02:39.880]  center wrote this i'm going to consider this to be an authentic
[02:02:39.880 --> 02:02:43.720]  document now i'm going to put it out unless you tonight right now
[02:02:43.720 --> 02:02:48.680]  and but again i have a right as a citizen to expose treason like that
[02:02:48.680 --> 02:02:52.920]  and everybody else is just so not need afraid of the establishment that they
[02:02:52.920 --> 02:02:57.880]  just won't do anything while the criminals just run wild
[02:02:57.880 --> 02:03:01.080]  and the feds are federalizing police departments all over the country
[02:03:01.080 --> 02:03:04.840]  oh a cop shot somebody and it's questionable okay we federalize your
[02:03:04.840 --> 02:03:08.200]  department or oh williamson county you know
[02:03:08.200 --> 02:03:11.800]  uh you know cops are using steroids will federalize it you know it's just
[02:03:11.800 --> 02:03:15.640]  any type of nitpicking while the federal government's run by foreign banks that
[02:03:15.640 --> 02:03:20.760]  launder the money just run the major crime operations
[02:03:20.760 --> 02:03:24.600]  it's like the irs will go after blue collar people
[02:03:24.600 --> 02:03:28.600]  that's on record but won't go after billionaires
[02:03:28.920 --> 02:03:33.640]  it's just it's just it's just so out of control what was your other question
[02:03:33.640 --> 02:03:38.120]  you made a few references before about um about a satellite transmission like
[02:03:38.120 --> 02:03:40.840]  some sort of video transmission that you've been working on
[02:03:40.840 --> 02:03:45.000]  and uh you you know really enjoy you guys have some real hard-hitting news and
[02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:48.280]  might be a way of you guys spreading your message more i'm just wondering
[02:03:48.280 --> 02:03:51.960]  well yes i mean i've wanted to put us on television in a satellite for like 15
[02:03:51.960 --> 02:03:55.480]  years but now the internet is already so big
[02:03:55.480 --> 02:04:02.120]  we're on tvo and roku and boxy and scores of other platforms we've signed up
[02:04:02.120 --> 02:04:05.240]  on and we're always in the top 10 of political stuff
[02:04:05.240 --> 02:04:09.080]  or news on those so it's almost like we waited so long
[02:04:09.080 --> 02:04:12.200]  now we're on everybody's quote smart television already
[02:04:12.200 --> 02:04:16.280]  uh but but yeah we're looking at some satellites looking at some channels
[02:04:16.280 --> 02:04:19.880]  that's getting very very close but it's almost like we waited so long
[02:04:19.880 --> 02:04:24.600]  it just doesn't even matter i mean we we have like five six million views a week
[02:04:24.600 --> 02:04:29.720]  on our own channel on youtube now we have all these other channels even more
[02:04:29.720 --> 02:04:34.120]  that's just youtube and then we've got over 170 terrestrial
[02:04:34.120 --> 02:04:39.320]  affiliates where we reach millions a day and so but yes
[02:04:39.320 --> 02:04:42.680]  really the only way to go really have an effect on cable or satellite is to do
[02:04:42.680 --> 02:04:45.960]  24 hours a day like glenn beckstone and i just
[02:04:45.960 --> 02:04:48.840]  have the time the energy the money to try something like that
[02:04:48.840 --> 02:04:53.320]  that's why i'm glad glenn beck is out there and and really want him to succeed
[02:04:53.320 --> 02:04:56.200]  uh and others because i don't like being the only one talking about this stuff

[02:09:31.960 --> 02:09:36.680]  yeah uh you know everybody's dancing around the word conspiracy as far as
[02:09:36.680 --> 02:09:40.120]  abola goes and you got to know if they're
[02:09:40.120 --> 02:09:43.000]  going to release something they're not going to release it in the united
[02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:46.440]  states to release it in africa it's going to
[02:09:46.440 --> 02:09:51.320]  reduce the props up and because the strain seems to be so powerful
[02:09:51.320 --> 02:09:56.040]  it kind of leads itself to that also i was told that obama's real job was to
[02:09:56.040 --> 02:10:01.000]  take over africa and i was like what and they go the resources there and if you
[02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:05.640]  look where obola is cropping up it's right where a lot of the
[02:10:05.640 --> 02:10:11.640]  minerals gold uh and there are three keys that go into electronics
[02:10:11.640 --> 02:10:16.440]  you're right all of the trace elements all of the rare earth minerals
[02:10:16.440 --> 02:10:20.200]  thank you for the call that's a great point africa
[02:10:20.200 --> 02:10:23.000]  you can look at different numbers of what they claim has been discovered of
[02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:27.720]  minerals or natural gas oil trace elements things they need for
[02:10:27.720 --> 02:10:33.960]  computer chips but africa conservatively
[02:10:33.960 --> 02:10:40.440]  conservatively has as much resources as all the rest of the surface area of
[02:10:40.440 --> 02:10:46.440]  discovered resources africa it just just
[02:10:46.440 --> 02:10:51.720]  it's just loaded loaded with everything
[02:10:51.720 --> 02:10:56.600]  loaded and it's true there is a policy that's come out in the carnage
[02:10:56.600 --> 02:10:59.000]  endowment come out from the un you can look it up
[02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:03.560]  the plan to divide and conquer to keep africa
[02:11:03.560 --> 02:11:07.400]  on its knees to to keep it from being
[02:11:07.400 --> 02:11:11.000]  industrialized that's in the royal commission 1949
[02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:14.440]  put out by his royal highness the king of england
[02:11:14.440 --> 02:11:18.200]  the policy to artificially suppress not just africa but the whole world
[02:11:18.200 --> 02:11:22.680]  but then we see the policy writ large in agenda 21 or clowered and pivot we see
[02:11:22.680 --> 02:11:26.120]  it repeated over and over again that's serfdom
[02:11:26.120 --> 02:11:30.680]  feudalism is where you keep people poor as a tool of control
[02:11:30.680 --> 02:11:35.000]  living at a subsistence level i remember the new york times two years
[02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:37.960]  ago i woke up one morning and saw paul wasan's
[02:11:37.960 --> 02:11:40.360]  headline
[02:11:41.080 --> 02:11:45.240]  and it was dealing with new york times admits
[02:11:45.240 --> 02:11:51.640]  un kills africans for carbon tax and then the new
[02:11:51.640 --> 02:11:55.320]  york times article said well it is true mercenaries working with the un
[02:11:55.320 --> 02:11:58.120]  go in and kill everybody in the villages because they're forcing them off their
[02:11:58.120 --> 02:12:02.600]  ancestral land to have as an environmental set aside
[02:12:02.600 --> 02:12:06.600]  shows they're allowed to mine next door kind of like the bundy ranch
[02:12:06.600 --> 02:12:10.760]  is the environmental concession set aside it's like in austin if you want to
[02:12:10.760 --> 02:12:13.640]  build that's fine you can build but you've got to buy property somewhere
[02:12:13.640 --> 02:12:16.280]  else and set it aside that you won't build on it ever
[02:12:16.280 --> 02:12:21.960]  it's an environmental easement and i just read that with just calmly
[02:12:21.960 --> 02:12:25.240]  reporting i have an guardian article from like
[02:12:25.240 --> 02:12:29.000]  15 years ago where they just admitted oh the un went in and killed
[02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:33.640]  4 000 bermes in berma because the un wanted the minerals the land was on for
[02:12:33.640 --> 02:12:36.040]  the un
[02:12:36.680 --> 02:12:41.480]  un development fund or something you just read this and it shows how cheap life
[02:12:41.480 --> 02:12:46.120]  is and everywhere the cia tries to put
[02:12:46.120 --> 02:12:49.560]  dictators in or oppressive regimes they don't care if they're left wing or
[02:12:49.560 --> 02:12:52.200]  right wing carol quickly wrote an 1100 page
[02:12:52.200 --> 02:12:57.080]  book tragedy and hope he was a top insider wrote the
[02:12:57.080 --> 02:13:00.680]  history of the new world order for them basically
[02:13:00.680 --> 02:13:06.200]  wrote the history of the anglo-american empire another book he wrote
[02:13:06.200 --> 02:13:09.880]  and i've read both books i read most of tragedy and hope i've read the whole
[02:13:09.880 --> 02:13:13.560]  thing it's 1100 pages i skipped the boring stuff but
[02:13:13.560 --> 02:13:19.560]  i probably read 800 pages of it here's the thing i said i'd go to phone
[02:13:19.560 --> 02:13:25.000]  calls it's just overwhelming how public and open this
[02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:27.880]  conspiracy is
[02:13:28.360 --> 02:13:31.880]  and so it lends itself that it's such a powerful strain of obola
[02:13:31.880 --> 02:13:36.200]  it lends itself the timing and it's in the season of crisis
[02:13:36.200 --> 02:13:39.960]  where the globalists have decided to pull out the stops on every front so i'll
[02:13:39.960 --> 02:13:43.480]  ask the question again every major analyst from the secretary of
[02:13:43.480 --> 02:13:46.680]  defense to the ministry of defense to you name it is saying the whole world
[02:13:46.680 --> 02:13:51.080]  starting to blow up obama though then plays the part of the good cop and
[02:13:51.080 --> 02:13:55.000]  goes the world never been safer i brought stability
[02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:59.560]  it's meant to confuse people but undoubtedly by every metric cultural
[02:13:59.560 --> 02:14:08.120]  financial health wise the world is degenerating no one can deny that
[02:14:08.120 --> 02:14:11.000]  you've got some of the rich yuppies and people they're disconnected have a
[02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:14.600]  have no idea what's going on you've got some of the unwashed masses that are
[02:14:14.600 --> 02:14:16.760]  busy watching their football games all day
[02:14:16.760 --> 02:14:21.000]  they are going to have a rude awakening how rough it is in the third world
[02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:24.040]  if you have the dollar that's the world currency right now
[02:14:24.040 --> 02:14:27.640]  and all other currencies are basically pegged to it any currency of
[02:14:27.640 --> 02:14:33.400]  any serious value or or wide usage and you have a devaluation of 20 30 percent
[02:14:33.400 --> 02:14:36.360]  of the dollar the last few years conservatively
[02:14:36.360 --> 02:14:41.640]  when you with half your income is spent on food
[02:14:41.640 --> 02:14:48.520]  or more what happens when food prices go up 30 percent you have a revolution
[02:14:48.520 --> 02:14:54.360]  because people are hungry and so on the back of africa and the
[02:14:54.360 --> 02:14:57.880]  middle east and many areas of asia and eastern europe
[02:14:57.880 --> 02:15:02.520]  not having enough food greece collapsing basically
[02:15:02.520 --> 02:15:06.920]  greeks are having to dump their kids out on the street and mass
[02:15:06.920 --> 02:15:10.440]  record numbers are homeless not drunk homeless real homeless
[02:15:10.440 --> 02:15:17.080]  right next door to resorts with rich yuppie americans laying around
[02:15:17.080 --> 02:15:21.720]  in the sun enjoying themselves while greeks are there serving them drinks
[02:15:21.720 --> 02:15:25.240]  when their kids don't have food enough to eat at home
[02:15:25.240 --> 02:15:28.120]  i think that causes resentment and it's not that it's bad to want to go to
[02:15:28.120 --> 02:15:31.560]  greece and land on the beach that at least brings some tourism and helps
[02:15:31.560 --> 02:15:37.720]  the country it's that it's it's it's it's obscene
[02:15:37.720 --> 02:15:40.600]  like i'm getting to the point where i realize i need to go out and buy things
[02:15:40.600 --> 02:15:44.760]  and helps the economy and uh you know that's that's love our economy or hate
[02:15:44.760 --> 02:15:51.480]  our economy that's what we've got is this consumer economy
[02:15:51.480 --> 02:15:55.160]  i'm trying to develop a barter economy a grassroots economy but at the same time
[02:15:55.160 --> 02:15:58.920]  it's not evil to own a nice house or have people that work for you
[02:15:58.920 --> 02:16:03.880]  that's how the economy operates but it becomes obscene at a certain point
[02:16:03.880 --> 02:16:07.080]  when the whole world's collapsing and we're still sitting around having no
[02:16:07.080 --> 02:16:10.120]  idea what's going to happen once it gets here and we have such a self-centered
[02:16:10.120 --> 02:16:15.640]  yuppie society can you imagine when hard times really hit america
[02:16:15.640 --> 02:16:18.840]  what it's going to be like the answer is it's going to be hellish
[02:16:18.840 --> 02:16:23.080]  it's going to be barbarous the bigger they are the harder they fall when this
[02:16:23.080 --> 02:16:26.120]  empire goes down which is it's designed to do
[02:16:26.120 --> 02:16:33.000]  and fold into the new global order it is going to be spectacularly horrible
[02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:36.760]  and that's why elites from israel to the united states
[02:16:36.760 --> 02:16:40.760]  from germany to france from england to australia
[02:16:40.760 --> 02:16:45.240]  are buying armored redoubts the middle of nowhere around other armored redoubts
[02:16:45.240 --> 02:16:49.480]  with private security forces already ready or they're moving
[02:16:49.480 --> 02:16:54.120]  to switzerland or luxembourg and i said i'd go to your calls and i'm ranting
[02:16:54.120 --> 02:16:57.640]  it's just that a caller points out
[02:16:57.640 --> 02:17:02.440]  the clear evidence that this rebella thing stinks to high heaven
[02:17:03.640 --> 02:17:07.960]  and then obama we we break this down in the obama deception
[02:17:07.960 --> 02:17:12.360]  he was president-elect when we made it it was released one month after he was in
[02:17:12.360 --> 02:17:17.000]  office two months after
[02:17:17.560 --> 02:17:20.920]  and we expose that he will invade africa that they will turn loose radical
[02:17:20.920 --> 02:17:24.440]  muslims in north africa to invade the whole area use that as a pretext to
[02:17:24.440 --> 02:17:28.360]  roll in invade and take over
[02:17:28.360 --> 02:17:32.120]  and how they would then use bio weapons to depopulate
[02:17:32.120 --> 02:17:35.400]  and then people see it happen like how do you know this because once you know
[02:17:35.400 --> 02:17:40.440]  you understand the modus operandi and it's not that obama himself is doing it
[02:17:40.440 --> 02:17:43.640]  it's that he's the front man because you got to have a black
[02:17:43.640 --> 02:17:48.200]  face on it or the people resist it
[02:17:48.200 --> 02:17:51.240]  the british empire never went away 60 years ago
[02:17:51.240 --> 02:17:54.920]  it learned to remove its flag put in its corporate front people
[02:17:54.920 --> 02:17:58.440]  and then the locals will put up with three four times the abuse
[02:17:58.440 --> 02:18:01.800]  from a local guy that looks like them then they'll put up
[02:18:01.800 --> 02:18:08.600]  from some white queen on the money you take the white queen off the money and
[02:18:08.600 --> 02:18:12.840]  you put a black guy on the money and the people put up whatever they want
[02:18:12.840 --> 02:18:16.120]  skip this network break as i said i go to your calls again that time back
[02:18:16.120 --> 02:18:21.080]  nathan in kansas you're on the air go ahead hey can you hear me yes i can sir

[02:18:24.280 --> 02:18:27.720]  rewind the clock a little bit uh going back to uh
[02:18:27.720 --> 02:18:31.720]  early this year to january sometime alert fema steaks
[02:18:31.720 --> 02:18:40.680]  bio disposal for 1000 hospital tents and uh the uh the uh the tent the the gear
[02:18:40.680 --> 02:18:43.880]  and also the uh disposal the dumpsters to get rid of it all
[02:18:43.880 --> 02:18:47.720]  you remember that i do vaguely remember that and your points really well taken
[02:18:47.720 --> 02:18:51.320]  your your audio is a little low talk right into your phone and repeat that
[02:18:51.320 --> 02:18:57.240]  headline again okay basically um i wanted like i said i wanted to uh
[02:18:57.240 --> 02:19:00.680]  get back to uh a story that came out earlier this year
[02:19:00.680 --> 02:19:04.680]  and it said alert fema steaks bio disposal for one
[02:19:04.680 --> 02:19:10.360]  1000 tent uh tent hospitals within 24 hour notice i remember that
[02:19:10.360 --> 02:19:14.120]  i think that that plays into the open borders and a bullet
[02:19:14.120 --> 02:19:19.800]  in some type of way well they're constantly buying billions of
[02:19:19.800 --> 02:19:23.800]  bullets and armored vehicles and building a merge they've been mind huge
[02:19:23.800 --> 02:19:27.160]  incinerators homeland security for hundreds of millions and
[02:19:27.160 --> 02:19:30.200]  placing them all over the country they've been digging in
[02:19:30.200 --> 02:19:34.200]  like the end of the world's coming and the government's running around scared
[02:19:34.200 --> 02:19:38.440]  to death acting like it's real so i don't know what they've told
[02:19:38.440 --> 02:19:42.360]  them i know what's in a lot of the open documentation i mean they have the army
[02:19:42.360 --> 02:19:47.480]  training and the marines to mow down whole cities okay
[02:19:47.480 --> 02:19:51.400]  in in that um in that i think they call it an rfi
[02:19:51.400 --> 02:19:55.080]  uh they were actually testing the responsiveness you know they were they
[02:19:55.080 --> 02:20:00.280]  were testing the ability to put up these tent cities or these hospital tents
[02:20:00.280 --> 02:20:04.360]  and the disposal and uh one of the one of the things with it was
[02:20:04.360 --> 02:20:10.840]  it was within 24 to 48 hour notice and uh in the article at states in uh 1000
[02:20:10.840 --> 02:20:13.400]  different locations throughout the united states
[02:20:13.400 --> 02:20:19.640]  and you know they've already uh uh what is it the cdc or or someone i can't
[02:20:19.640 --> 02:20:24.120]  remember exactly but they've set up all these uh little areas throughout the
[02:20:24.120 --> 02:20:28.440]  southern kind of united states spread out that kind of pretty much shadows
[02:20:28.440 --> 02:20:32.120]  where all the uh the immigrants are going
[02:20:32.120 --> 02:20:35.160]  do you remember that or yes there it is it's a fema
[02:20:35.160 --> 02:20:40.440]  accelerated preparations for pandemic january 2014
[02:20:40.440 --> 02:20:44.680]  uh plans for mass graves confirmed government surveying cemetery readiness
[02:20:44.680 --> 02:20:48.680]  for flu outbreak that was on the fed biz website
[02:20:48.680 --> 02:20:51.800]  uh what was the exact headline because we've been trying to find it
[02:20:51.800 --> 02:20:55.640]  and we're but i remember the article is about six months ago give me the exact
[02:20:55.640 --> 02:20:59.240]  headline again there it is now that's an older article for 2009
[02:20:59.240 --> 02:21:04.120]  go ahead alert alert fema seeks biodisposal for 1000
[02:21:04.120 --> 02:21:11.960]  tent hospital within 24 hour notice that's it alert alert fema seeks
[02:21:13.480 --> 02:21:19.320]  uh 1000 tent hospitals within 24 hour notice all right we'll put that up on
[02:21:19.320 --> 02:21:22.040]  screen thank you so much for pointing that out that's
[02:21:22.040 --> 02:21:25.560]  when i say i've got all this background that i'm concerned with there's just so
[02:21:25.560 --> 02:21:29.480]  much intel so much data even if the threat isn't real
[02:21:29.480 --> 02:21:33.240]  they're gearing up spending tens of billions on it like they never have
[02:21:33.240 --> 02:21:37.000]  before uh hardening facilities you name it while
[02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:41.160]  trying to start a civil war between the tea party and the police
[02:21:41.160 --> 02:21:44.200]  which they will prime the pump with false flags that's clear
[02:21:44.200 --> 02:21:48.520]  because the tea party is about as pro cop as you're going to get i mean
[02:21:48.520 --> 02:21:53.000]  to a fault it's ridiculous how much they groveled the establishment
[02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:56.920]  uh and i'm not attacking police either i'm just saying it's ridiculous to claim
[02:21:56.920 --> 02:21:59.960]  the tea party is going to link up with muslim extremists the tea party is
[02:21:59.960 --> 02:22:04.120]  going to blow up police any cop out there who's got any brain cells knows
[02:22:04.120 --> 02:22:08.760]  that's propaganda so the question is how will they sell the attack
[02:22:08.760 --> 02:22:13.240]  they will provide the patsies so you can see different game plans they've got
[02:22:13.240 --> 02:22:16.680]  and you can see it all starting to come to a big disgusting head
[02:22:16.680 --> 02:22:22.040]  right now but anything else oh yeah actually one last thing um you know we've
[02:22:22.040 --> 02:22:25.000]  been talking about uh or you've been talking about uh
[02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:29.320]  just being prepared and you know eating right and all that and my thing is
[02:22:29.320 --> 02:22:33.240]  uh everybody needs to uh to get the the survival seeds
[02:22:33.240 --> 02:22:36.920]  you know little vaults and things like that but before you do that you need to
[02:22:36.920 --> 02:22:40.040]  actually grow the food you need to actually start a garden
[02:22:40.040 --> 02:22:43.400]  and and learn how to actually garden i mean if you're gonna
[02:22:43.400 --> 02:22:47.000]  depend on a survival seed vault and you've never grown before
[02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:51.320]  i'm you're in for a surprise i mean you actually need to get your
[02:22:51.320 --> 02:22:54.920]  your garden's going and uh it doesn't take much and you can
[02:22:54.920 --> 02:22:58.200]  literally go out into your backyard and pick your dinner

[02:23:16.920 --> 02:23:21.640]  and i totally agree with you people need to get the survival seed banks
[02:23:21.640 --> 02:23:26.200]  save one but plant the other even if you live in a city they'll have community
[02:23:26.200 --> 02:23:29.720]  gardens where you go get a free plot and plant it there and it's just so
[02:23:29.720 --> 02:23:33.560]  enjoyable to take your own watermelon home to take your own squash home to

[02:24:22.360 --> 02:24:24.920]  Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs were talking last week i believe it was on the
[02:24:24.920 --> 02:24:28.520]  anniversary of september 11th yes how obama didn't even mention anything
[02:24:28.520 --> 02:24:31.640]  about the christians being attacked and killed by uh
[02:24:31.640 --> 02:24:35.400]  isis isle whatever the heck he wants to call them you know for this week or for
[02:24:35.400 --> 02:24:39.080]  this hour and uh because it's because one is in
[02:24:39.080 --> 02:24:42.840]  charge and who is in charge of the shadow government that we
[02:24:42.840 --> 02:24:45.880]  don't see that people are just totally oblivious to
[02:24:45.880 --> 02:24:48.840]  because of the statism that they're force fed every day and they accepted as
[02:24:48.840 --> 02:24:53.240]  gospel it is a luciferian satanic cabal that is
[02:24:53.240 --> 02:24:57.160]  in charge that has does nothing and wants nothing more than to
[02:24:57.160 --> 02:25:00.280]  control us and be tyrannical over every aspect of our
[02:25:00.280 --> 02:25:02.040]  lives i know you said these weren't people to talk
[02:25:02.040 --> 02:25:05.320]  about Ebola and stuff like that you know and earlier you had said something
[02:25:05.320 --> 02:25:09.640]  what is it like the year of chaos or how did you say that i forgot how
[02:25:09.640 --> 02:25:13.560]  you had said that it's just a season of chaos on every front
[02:25:13.560 --> 02:25:18.520]  the people running world civilization are trying to wreck things on purpose
[02:25:18.520 --> 02:25:22.440]  and we even have their own documents like a june 21
[02:25:22.440 --> 02:25:27.720]  where they admit it exactly exactly and see it goes back to something that this
[02:25:27.720 --> 02:25:31.080]  isn't a bible that the disciples came to jesus and asked him what would be the
[02:25:31.080 --> 02:25:34.520]  signs of the times against the world jesus told them there'll be
[02:25:34.520 --> 02:25:38.520]  wars rumors and wars famines pestilence earthquakes and diverse places
[02:25:38.520 --> 02:25:42.120]  but he said something else after that that people forget
[02:25:42.120 --> 02:25:47.240]  he said then shall come the sorrows of sorrows such as never been seen before
[02:25:47.240 --> 02:25:50.920]  by man on the face of the earth and this is that that's the season of chaos
[02:25:50.920 --> 02:25:53.240]  that you're talking about and these glitter bug
[02:25:53.240 --> 02:25:56.440]  501c3 preachers that get up there until
[02:25:56.440 --> 02:25:59.560]  and preach the rapture you know that we're going to be taken away and we're
[02:25:59.560 --> 02:26:02.920]  not going to have to suffer jesus said in the bible who are used that you
[02:26:02.920 --> 02:26:05.640]  should not suffer even as your masters suffered
[02:26:05.640 --> 02:26:08.680]  these people well sure christ said they'll persecute you like they persecuted
[02:26:08.680 --> 02:26:12.840]  me and i'm not here being a Pharisee saying i'm all
[02:26:12.840 --> 02:26:17.720]  high and mighty and i'm great i pray i mean i pray privately
[02:26:17.720 --> 02:26:21.960]  my my issue is these name and claimant prosperity preachers
[02:26:21.960 --> 02:26:25.880]  have been linked to the government and they're there
[02:26:25.880 --> 02:26:29.880]  surely trying to neutralize christians so they won't be politically and
[02:26:29.880 --> 02:26:33.880]  culturally and spiritually involved telling them everything's wonderful
[02:26:33.880 --> 02:26:37.560]  like opiate like a drug like a sleeping gas
[02:26:37.560 --> 02:26:43.400]  to put them into a trance and it turns out they are clergy response team
[02:26:43.400 --> 02:26:49.560]  certified government agents on record to pacify people and let me tell you
[02:26:49.560 --> 02:26:52.360]  i wouldn't want to be those preachers on judgment day
[02:26:52.360 --> 02:26:56.840]  because leading your flock into the one world government
[02:26:56.840 --> 02:27:00.600]  telling them that everything's great and the and the worst things get wonderful
[02:27:00.600 --> 02:27:05.560]  it means jesus is around the corner that just sounds like a total cop out
[02:27:05.560 --> 02:27:08.760]  does anybody who's a christian think that god
[02:27:08.760 --> 02:27:14.760]  is looking for people like that that god is testing us here
[02:27:14.760 --> 02:27:20.440]  to try to find people like that that's why i'm so angry at these preachers
[02:27:20.440 --> 02:27:24.040]  you can see these devil worshipers and other scum they're out in the open
[02:27:24.040 --> 02:27:27.800]  and i don't like them but these sneaky government agents in fact guys go to
[02:27:27.800 --> 02:27:31.480]  youtube type in clergy response team it's a
[02:27:31.480 --> 02:27:35.400]  nbc news piece out on new orleans where they have the preachers admitting we
[02:27:35.400 --> 02:27:38.360]  work for the government so folks accept martial law
[02:27:38.360 --> 02:27:41.800]  we broke that three years before with pastor butch paul here on air
[02:27:41.800 --> 02:27:46.680]  before it was finally admitted on the news but now they think we're so stupid
[02:27:46.680 --> 02:27:50.360]  they admit that they've turned most of our preachers into actual government
[02:27:50.360 --> 02:27:55.000]  agents which totally violates the first amendment the first amendment says
[02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:59.400]  government isn't supposed to be involved not that government has a
[02:27:59.400 --> 02:28:02.600]  jurisdiction over religion god bless you i appreciate your call
[02:28:02.600 --> 02:28:06.200]  we're going to go to break and come back with kelly barbara
[02:28:06.200 --> 02:28:10.600]  frogo paul and others but before i do that let's go out to break with this
[02:28:10.600 --> 02:28:16.280]  tv news piece on the clergy response team let's start it at the beginning
[02:28:16.280 --> 02:28:19.240]  and then we'll go to break and come out in america
[02:28:19.240 --> 02:28:24.520]  some fear any nuclear biological or chemical attack on us territory
[02:28:24.520 --> 02:28:28.520]  might trigger just that and as case lay news 12 jeff ferrell discovered
[02:28:28.520 --> 02:28:32.920]  the clergy would help the government with potentially their biggest problem
[02:28:32.920 --> 02:28:38.040]  us from my cold dead hand charlton heston's famous
[02:28:38.040 --> 02:28:43.400]  declaration captures a truly american value the overarching desire to protect
[02:28:43.400 --> 02:28:47.000]  our freedoms but gun confiscation is exactly what
[02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:50.520]  happened during the state of emergency following hurricane katrina in new
[02:28:50.520 --> 02:28:55.000]  orleans u.s troops also arrived something far easier to do even
[02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:59.240]  now thanks to last year's elimination of the 1878 posse
[02:28:59.240 --> 02:29:05.960]  comatotus act that forbid us troops from policing on american soil
[02:29:05.960 --> 02:29:10.280]  if marshal law weren't acted here at home like depicted in the movie the siege
[02:29:10.280 --> 02:29:13.640]  easing public fears and quelling dissent would be critical
[02:29:13.640 --> 02:29:17.080]  and that's exactly what the clergy response team has its called
[02:29:17.080 --> 02:29:20.760]  helped accomplish in new orleans jeff the primary thing that we say to
[02:29:20.760 --> 02:29:23.240]  anybody is let's cooperate and get this thing over with
[02:29:23.240 --> 02:29:26.120]  and then we'll settle the differences once the crisis is over
[02:29:26.120 --> 02:29:29.880]  such clergy response teams would walk a tightrope between the needs of the
[02:29:29.880 --> 02:29:32.280]  government versus the wishes of the public
[02:29:32.280 --> 02:29:36.600]  a lot of cases these clergy are going to come back known in the neighborhood
[02:29:36.600 --> 02:29:40.440]  and again they begin the report saying under marshal law the clergy response
[02:29:40.440 --> 02:29:45.240]  team will make you basically submit we're going to break down what these
[02:29:45.240 --> 02:29:48.920]  wolves will do during a disaster
[02:29:48.920 --> 02:29:52.760]  we're on the march the empires on the run

[02:35:14.520 --> 02:35:17.560]  and this particular robot will carry a fair amount of weapons
[02:35:17.560 --> 02:35:20.600]  but ought to make you think twice about crossing the borders of
[02:35:20.600 --> 02:35:25.880]  south korea illegally and it has been tested out of a demilitarized zone
[02:35:25.880 --> 02:35:29.320]  along the border with its neighbor north korea
[02:35:29.320 --> 02:35:33.160]  this sgr a1 will be able to detect intruders
[02:35:33.160 --> 02:35:38.920]  with the help of machine vision cameras alongside a combination of heat and
[02:35:38.920 --> 02:35:44.760]  motion sensors isn't that just precious

[02:35:56.280 --> 02:36:00.600]  after the people the whole idea of the samsung
[02:36:00.600 --> 02:36:05.560]  sgr a1 is to let the military robot sendry to the work of its human
[02:36:05.560 --> 02:36:09.240]  counterparts over demilitarized zone with south and north border
[02:36:09.240 --> 02:36:13.000]  so there will be minimal loss of life on the south korean side
[02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:16.680]  just in case things turn sour
[02:36:17.560 --> 02:36:21.320]  oh yeah because north korea hasn't promised to train 100 000 pieces of
[02:36:21.320 --> 02:36:26.600]  artillery on seol and burn it in a matter of hours
[02:36:26.600 --> 02:36:31.000]  as it's estimated no this is giving control of human
[02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:34.520]  weapons systems to the machines and to the technocracy that runs it
[02:36:34.520 --> 02:36:38.840]  so they can launch attacks or or false flags this is just a disaster waiting
[02:36:38.840 --> 02:36:43.000]  to happen and it's all unfolding
[02:36:44.120 --> 02:36:46.760]  i got a lot of other news i'm gonna be getting to but let's race through your
[02:36:46.760 --> 02:36:50.360]  calls kelly in texas thanks for holding her on the air
[02:36:50.360 --> 02:36:56.040]  hi god bless you brother i bless you uh uh he does i have fun you talk about all

[02:36:59.800 --> 02:37:03.880]  your fema guards right there we're gonna come to but at any rate with
[02:37:03.880 --> 02:37:08.200]  all these uh viruses stuff i lost my wife to lou garis disease
[02:37:08.200 --> 02:37:12.120]  a year ago memorial day i'm 73 years old
[02:37:12.120 --> 02:37:17.320]  uh thanks and uh she was in the federal system for a little bit but i think
[02:37:17.320 --> 02:37:20.600]  i mean i had to go back and look and i think she got a blue shot i've never
[02:37:20.600 --> 02:37:25.800]  had one won't get one i don't take anything like that at all
[02:37:25.800 --> 02:37:30.760]  period as a matter of fact now i take uh your uh survival shield x2 and
[02:37:30.760 --> 02:37:34.840]  fatality and all that because of all this but and i'm fixing to go have a
[02:37:34.840 --> 02:37:38.120]  surgery done it wins the on my shoulder and i'm scared to go back in there
[02:37:38.120 --> 02:37:40.680]  because i don't know what's going to happen now that i got to get it done so
[02:37:40.680 --> 02:37:43.880]  i can work but my point is all these viruses
[02:37:43.880 --> 02:37:48.920]  we're not post antibiotic error now we have nothing to touch it but my wife
[02:37:48.920 --> 02:37:52.360]  was i took care of her here in my home because she passed away i took all the
[02:37:52.360 --> 02:37:55.720]  work to do it and i do it again in part of me because i wouldn't put her in a
[02:37:55.720 --> 02:37:59.160]  home but the times that she had to go to the hospital
[02:37:59.160 --> 02:38:03.080]  uh she uh uh got a
[02:38:03.080 --> 02:38:06.360]  infection of one of the super bugs so-called super bugs they got
[02:38:06.360 --> 02:38:10.600]  they got in her urine they said well there's no antibiotics it'll punch it
[02:38:10.600 --> 02:38:14.360]  i just think that our government is evil they're pulling out all stops they're
[02:38:14.360 --> 02:38:20.760]  using several different parts uh being taken down the borders being
[02:38:20.760 --> 02:38:24.520]  uh these biological warfare that they're putting out on the public which is what
[02:38:24.520 --> 02:38:27.560]  i think it is and i don't think that there's
[02:38:27.560 --> 02:38:30.840]  stopping yet they're trying to keep us confused so they can have so many
[02:38:30.840 --> 02:38:33.160]  different fronts you just can't focus on one
[02:38:33.160 --> 02:38:36.360]  that's my opinion that's right and they put estrogen mimickers in the printer
[02:38:36.360 --> 02:38:40.680]  ink in the food lining to make women hyper feminine that gives them thyroid
[02:38:40.680 --> 02:38:43.880]  problem breast problems you name it and to make men feminine
[02:38:43.880 --> 02:38:48.200]  so there's no real men normal men when they're being enslaved take action
[02:38:48.200 --> 02:38:52.360]  but they have lower the testosterone on record by at least 50 percent
[02:38:52.360 --> 02:38:55.880]  in the average man living in the industrialized nation i don't care if
[02:38:55.880 --> 02:39:00.520]  you're black white or hispanic your your testosterone has been artificially
[02:39:00.520 --> 02:39:03.000]  lowered by these people i mean they know exactly
[02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:06.600]  what they're doing and lo and behold bertrand russell wrote about lowering
[02:39:06.600 --> 02:39:11.160]  testosterone in the 1930s with additives in food and water
[02:39:11.160 --> 02:39:14.360]  and lo and behold in 1974 the year i was born
[02:39:14.360 --> 02:39:18.040]  the current white house science czar wrote eco science that by the way they've
[02:39:18.040 --> 02:39:20.600]  taken off scrib online they don't want you're eating now
[02:39:20.600 --> 02:39:24.520]  it was free online it was a government textbook on their plan to sterilize the
[02:39:24.520 --> 02:39:27.960]  population through the food and water they are doing it god bless your
[02:39:27.960 --> 02:39:31.640]  brother good to hear from you sorry about your wife
[02:39:32.440 --> 02:39:36.840]  barbara in arizona you're on the air go ahead
[02:39:37.320 --> 02:39:42.920]  hi alex hey yeah i was i'm calling about the um
[02:39:42.920 --> 02:39:46.920]  you know uh about carriers of disease like typhoid merry
[02:39:46.920 --> 02:39:51.000]  yes yes i have personal experience with that uh
[02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:55.080]  it's with a dog and a cat but i mean you know it's the same thing uh there was a
[02:39:55.080 --> 02:39:57.960]  dog of the tempered carrier that gave my puppy just
[02:39:57.960 --> 02:40:01.160]  temper and then afterwards the people told me oh yeah my dog's a
[02:40:01.160 --> 02:40:04.600]  you know carrier of december but it it was it you know they live
[02:40:04.600 --> 02:40:09.560]  long life and then i had a cat in 81 that lived for 20 years that was a
[02:40:09.560 --> 02:40:14.840]  carrier of feline leukemia and she never saw a symptom or anything but it was
[02:40:14.840 --> 02:40:18.520]  verified by the vet that she you know was a carrier i had to keep her away from
[02:40:18.520 --> 02:40:21.400]  everything and keep her in the house that's right my
[02:40:21.400 --> 02:40:24.600]  my parents had like three cats when i was growing up
[02:40:24.600 --> 02:40:28.360]  and then they found out that one of them was a carrier uh of
[02:40:28.360 --> 02:40:33.000]  the uh cat aids or whatever it is that humans can't get but it's hiv
[02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:36.840]  and then it wasn't killing that cat but but that it was viral and would kill
[02:40:36.840 --> 02:40:41.800]  other cats so they didn't get more cats after that until that cat had died
[02:40:41.800 --> 02:40:46.440]  because there's so many i haven't worked for a vet in years what is it
[02:40:46.440 --> 02:40:50.280]  there's there's there's there's kitty aids and then there's kitty uh
[02:40:50.280 --> 02:40:53.800]  leukemia like you said that's transferable and see there's a lot of
[02:40:53.800 --> 02:40:57.720]  stuff in humans like this too that they won't tell you's viral
[02:40:57.720 --> 02:41:01.800]  like they know a lot of type one diabetes that you know that they claim is
[02:41:01.800 --> 02:41:05.080]  genetic is really uh and this isn't me because i'm
[02:41:05.080 --> 02:41:07.640]  a medical doctor i've been told this by medical doctors on air
[02:41:07.640 --> 02:41:11.080]  i've seen it i've been told by people at the del medical center
[02:41:11.080 --> 02:41:14.440]  here in austin i've talked to folks that have been involved
[02:41:14.440 --> 02:41:17.480]  uh that they're getting pancreatitis from a virus they're telling them well it's
[02:41:17.480 --> 02:41:21.320]  genetic now when they know full well it's a virus that's done it
[02:41:21.320 --> 02:41:24.920]  and that their pancreas might turn back on but once they put them on the
[02:41:24.920 --> 02:41:28.280]  insulin it's not going to turn back on do you see what i'm saying
[02:41:28.280 --> 02:41:33.640]  right yes most cancer is viral that that's been known since the 20s
[02:41:33.640 --> 02:41:38.200]  right go ahead and i was just gonna you know so
[02:41:38.200 --> 02:41:41.320]  that's why you don't people yeah they could be carrying a bowl all around and
[02:41:41.320 --> 02:41:44.440]  you know and they just don't know symptoms it leaves a lot of like just
[02:41:44.440 --> 02:41:47.800]  like typhoid and mirrors and the other thing i want to say is um
[02:41:47.800 --> 02:41:52.040]  i'm a member of uh you know prison planet thank you with my family and friends
[02:41:52.040 --> 02:41:55.560]  and i just want to thank you so much for for my being able to do that to share
[02:41:55.560 --> 02:42:00.200]  it thank you thank you so much i'm going to say this again
[02:42:01.640 --> 02:42:04.920]  i am overall a very good person compared to everybody i know i'm probably one
[02:42:04.920 --> 02:42:11.240]  the nicest most moral people i i know but i still have really bad thoughts
[02:42:11.240 --> 02:42:16.840]  and and i'm a wicked person we all are so when you tell me thank you and how
[02:42:16.840 --> 02:42:20.840]  great i am it is such a responsibility to be here on air
[02:42:20.840 --> 02:42:25.320]  it is so humbling to be here on air and to have so many people counting on me
[02:42:25.320 --> 02:42:30.120]  while i stammer and stutter and you know do all my little tics and things that i
[02:42:30.120 --> 02:42:33.720]  do that that's why i want to tell you you don't
[02:42:33.720 --> 02:42:39.400]  need to thank me we're all in this together we we love justice and truth
[02:42:39.400 --> 02:42:42.360]  so much that we even hate our own worldliness even though it's not that
[02:42:42.360 --> 02:42:47.080]  big compared to people we would call bad but when you really meet somebody who
[02:42:47.080 --> 02:42:50.600]  is awake and does know what's going on they are always very humble it's
[02:42:50.600 --> 02:42:55.240]  because you're then aware of your own shortcomings and other people
[02:42:55.240 --> 02:43:01.800]  and it's not that it hurts me when you say thank you and things
[02:43:01.800 --> 02:43:05.800]  it's that you're counting on me so much that then i feel like i'm not working
[02:43:05.800 --> 02:43:10.040]  enough i'm not doing a good enough job you see what i'm saying
[02:43:10.040 --> 02:43:14.280]  yeah i understand yes but um yeah i mean i'm not how to describe it it's a
[02:43:14.280 --> 02:43:17.080]  feeling but listen god bless you i appreciate your call
[02:43:17.080 --> 02:43:20.680]  i mean i'd liken it to a video we never aired of australia
[02:43:20.680 --> 02:43:24.920]  i think it was australia where a train ran over a guy's leg and it was stuck on
[02:43:24.920 --> 02:43:29.560]  top his leg and
[02:43:29.560 --> 02:43:32.520]  one person got over there and started pushing on the train and nothing
[02:43:32.520 --> 02:43:36.200]  happened but then pretty soon everybody gets on the big train
[02:43:36.200 --> 02:43:42.360]  and they lean the whole train up so they can get his leg out from under it
[02:43:42.360 --> 02:43:45.400]  now if government would have tried to do that he'd have died of shock it had
[02:43:45.400 --> 02:43:47.880]  taken a day to get a crane in there and get it off his leg
[02:43:47.880 --> 02:43:51.960]  but the people took action together and they knew how to push the train how to
[02:43:51.960 --> 02:43:54.920]  get it off his leg and how to set it back down
[02:43:54.920 --> 02:43:58.760]  but it'd be like if i was pushing on the train and you were thanking me for
[02:43:58.760 --> 02:44:03.080]  pushing on the train listen if i'm not pushing on the train you
[02:44:03.080 --> 02:44:06.600]  need to be punching me in the nose figuratively
[02:44:06.600 --> 02:44:12.920]  it's not exceptional to push on the train or to pick the car up off the kid
[02:44:12.920 --> 02:44:16.920]  and in the fact that we think it's exceptional and by the way when i see a
[02:44:16.920 --> 02:44:20.680]  police officer helping a lady change her tire
[02:44:20.680 --> 02:44:24.200]  i want to pull over and thank them i want to write a letter of commendation
[02:44:24.200 --> 02:44:27.400]  you know to the police chief saying i saw him doing something good and then it
[02:44:27.400 --> 02:44:32.120]  clicks that's what cops used to do most of the time
[02:44:32.120 --> 02:44:36.200]  when they were on a call not because they were little pathetic servants but
[02:44:36.200 --> 02:44:40.360]  because they were real men and knew that was the highest order
[02:44:40.360 --> 02:44:45.000]  was going out and helping children and women and things like that with chivalry
[02:44:45.000 --> 02:44:48.280]  so then i think no i don't need to think that cop but i need to point out that
[02:44:48.280 --> 02:44:51.960]  there are good people like that out there so that that becomes the example
[02:44:51.960 --> 02:44:56.520]  of what it is to be manly and good but it's not something extra wonderful
[02:44:56.520 --> 02:45:00.840]  it's the bare minimum level that we should expect or we become
[02:45:00.840 --> 02:45:05.560]  self-centered arrogant blobs myself included
[02:45:05.560 --> 02:45:12.040]  entitled i said earlier i am uh i can't help it
[02:45:12.040 --> 02:45:17.560]  when i go out and like eat some expensive seafood dinner
[02:45:17.560 --> 02:45:21.480]  and i think about all the starving children around the world i feel guilty
[02:45:21.480 --> 02:45:24.520]  and i know it's good to go eat a nice seafood dinner and
[02:45:24.520 --> 02:45:27.480]  pay the waiter a nice tip and and have a restaurant
[02:45:27.480 --> 02:45:30.680]  but i see how the fake left controls well-meaning people
[02:45:30.680 --> 02:45:34.520]  that any type of wealth is bad because they take people who have empathy
[02:45:34.520 --> 02:45:37.480]  and and who feel guilty when they're doing better than others and they
[02:45:37.480 --> 02:45:42.040]  manipulate us into turning over our lives to the state to have our money
[02:45:42.040 --> 02:45:46.440]  spent where they would so i'm going to do an analogy soon
[02:45:46.440 --> 02:45:50.200]  or a or a parallel video or maybe even really do it for real a restaurant would
[02:45:50.200 --> 02:45:54.440]  let me where i want to go in and sit down with hidden cameras
[02:45:54.440 --> 02:45:58.280]  at a table at a nice restaurant and say mind if i have half your iced tea and
[02:45:58.280 --> 02:46:01.160]  half your steak they're going to say get out of here
[02:46:01.160 --> 02:46:03.320]  you're crazy and i'm going to say well i'm the government
[02:46:03.320 --> 02:46:06.360]  or i'm these corporations that want government welfare
[02:46:06.360 --> 02:46:10.200]  it's the equivalent of coming and sitting down at your dinner table
[02:46:10.200 --> 02:46:14.360]  see where is their guilt i feel guilty
[02:46:14.440 --> 02:46:17.800]  if i've got a new forward f150 pickup truck i mean i bought it two years ago
[02:46:17.800 --> 02:46:20.760]  but i consider it to be new
[02:46:20.760 --> 02:46:25.320]  meanwhile i see people who are government bureaucrats i know stole the
[02:46:25.320 --> 02:46:28.760]  money driving brand new Mercedes and they're all glitter bugs getting off
[02:46:28.760 --> 02:46:31.640]  on people looking at them in their fancy vehicle and i'm not
[02:46:31.640 --> 02:46:35.720]  seeing a fancy vehicle is bad in and of itself i'd love to drive some 700
[02:46:35.720 --> 02:46:39.320]  horsepower sports car but not because i want to be looked at because i want to
[02:46:39.320 --> 02:46:43.320]  drive a fast car and again i'm kind of
[02:46:43.320 --> 02:46:46.200]  waxing philosophical and i'm not even giving answers here
[02:46:46.200 --> 02:46:49.640]  i'm just talking about what goes on in my mind
[02:46:49.640 --> 02:46:53.560]  because i have a conscience i have guilt i have guilt about things i shouldn't
[02:46:53.560 --> 02:46:57.880]  even have guilt about because i intellectually know the right thing
[02:46:57.880 --> 02:47:00.840]  but there's that internal dialogue where i'm trying
[02:47:00.840 --> 02:47:04.920]  to be a good person trying to really be honorable trying to not just say i'm a
[02:47:04.920 --> 02:47:08.680]  good person but i'm trying to really be one
[02:47:08.680 --> 02:47:12.520]  there's that compared to these sociopaths and psychos
[02:47:12.520 --> 02:47:16.840]  who are running around everywhere who just think because it's for them
[02:47:16.840 --> 02:47:22.360]  and what they want why then it's fine and you can go dine a ditch
[02:47:24.440 --> 02:47:28.760]  and i know there's a mass awakening happening right now
[02:47:28.760 --> 02:47:31.800]  because things that have been going on for a long time that nobody made a big
[02:47:31.800 --> 02:47:36.920]  deal out of are now all over the news wall street journal new york times
[02:47:36.920 --> 02:47:41.960]  let me find it right here um that what doesn't matter
[02:47:41.960 --> 02:47:44.680]  i got a whole bunch of articles here on this subject today
[02:47:44.680 --> 02:47:49.880]  where police all over the country are pulling people over who haven't stolen
[02:47:49.880 --> 02:47:52.760]  anything or don't have drugs on them and taking their
[02:47:52.760 --> 02:47:57.960]  five thousand dollars or two thousand dollars or even taking their car
[02:47:58.760 --> 02:48:01.960]  one of the headlines today is when cops became robbers
[02:48:01.960 --> 02:48:05.400]  and there's a whole stack of news here about how the big banks are caught
[02:48:05.400 --> 02:48:08.520]  laundering drug money
[02:48:08.520 --> 02:48:16.840]  and that's old news for our audience but it's not old news
[02:48:17.560 --> 02:48:22.360]  for the general public it's just not waking up here's boston globe today
[02:48:22.360 --> 02:48:27.160]  and reason dot com both have articles police seizures of cash rise
[02:48:27.160 --> 02:48:30.920]  fueled by private training firms
[02:48:31.160 --> 02:48:35.560]  and then there's another one that we just mentioned
[02:48:35.560 --> 02:48:40.360]  out of reason when cops become robbers and it's a federal program because the
[02:48:40.360 --> 02:48:43.560]  states they got abused 20 years ago the state said okay
[02:48:43.560 --> 02:48:47.000]  cops can only keep you know 10 of the money they seize now for the department
[02:48:47.000 --> 02:48:50.120]  you can't have 90 of it you are clearly out there robbing old
[02:48:50.120 --> 02:48:53.880]  ladies in these departments and so the feds came along and said we'll give you
[02:48:53.880 --> 02:48:57.480]  75 80 percent if you will put the money into a federal
[02:48:57.480 --> 02:49:01.480]  program well that just federalized the police i've been talking about this
[02:49:01.480 --> 02:49:06.840]  since i got on air and it's now no exaggeration when i go through my stack
[02:49:06.840 --> 02:49:10.520]  every day the last month it's in the stack four or five times
[02:49:10.520 --> 02:49:13.240]  i only found two of these while sitting there fumbling around looking for it
[02:49:13.240 --> 02:49:17.080]  right now when i remembered it there's probably five of these today
[02:49:17.080 --> 02:49:22.600]  in the stack and you'd think alex jones wrote all these
[02:49:27.800 --> 02:49:31.320]  and let me tell you in the past it would be some weird boss hog thing and
[02:49:31.320 --> 02:49:35.480]  louisiana or texas because most towns the cops weren't criminals robbing you
[02:49:35.480 --> 02:49:40.600]  but you pull into the wrong town and
[02:49:40.600 --> 02:49:43.560]  the cop walks over and is obviously a criminal looking at you with a criminal
[02:49:43.560 --> 02:49:48.760]  looking his eyes giggling at you so let me see your driver's license
[02:49:48.760 --> 02:49:51.240]  and they that's a lot of money i've even had this happen to me and i go
[02:49:51.240 --> 02:49:55.080]  $200 a lot of money would you get it but there's something on it this actually
[02:49:55.080 --> 02:49:59.240]  happened to me once that's $200 they didn't take it
[02:49:59.240 --> 02:50:02.520]  they pull over an old lady she's got three grand in there they know old ladies
[02:50:02.520 --> 02:50:05.720]  tend to carry a lot of money on them especially depression error women
[02:50:05.720 --> 02:50:09.480]  they might carry half their money with them in their purse
[02:50:09.480 --> 02:50:13.480]  no more need you step to the back they get you in the out there they rob you
[02:50:13.480 --> 02:50:16.840]  they go i'm gonna take it and if you don't do it i'm gonna go ahead and arrest
[02:50:16.840 --> 02:50:19.880]  you and i know there's gonna be drugs on this money because they know all money
[02:50:19.880 --> 02:50:24.120]  has drugs on unless it's brand new and then they do that in one town in texas
[02:50:24.120 --> 02:50:27.480]  cnn had a special on it they had robbed something like
[02:50:27.480 --> 02:50:31.400]  20 000 people a year like that
[02:50:31.400 --> 02:50:34.600]  and let me tell you get pulled over by a cop with double swastikas on their
[02:50:34.600 --> 02:50:42.200]  forearms oh i forgot that part one time we were actually speeding
[02:50:42.200 --> 02:50:46.200]  when i was a teenager and we'd even been drinking beer not a lot of it
[02:50:46.200 --> 02:50:49.400]  but we both had blonde hair and blue eyes and the guy literally said oh you're
[02:50:49.400 --> 02:50:53.800]  white howl hitler and then you can go
[02:50:53.800 --> 02:50:59.960]  and we were like whoa oh my god this is incredible stay with us

[02:54:03.000 --> 02:54:05.880]  i apologize i've been a little bit scattered brain today but sometimes i
[02:54:05.880 --> 02:54:09.240]  say those are the best shows my children never wake up a lot of
[02:54:09.240 --> 02:54:11.880]  night unless they're sick but my daughter for whatever reason i don't
[02:54:11.880 --> 02:54:16.600]  know if she's not caffeine or what woke up i'm not exaggerating
[02:54:16.600 --> 02:54:20.520]  10 times last night and came into my bedroom and was waking me up
[02:54:20.520 --> 02:54:25.240]  and so i feel great today but i can tell i'm gonna crash later with no sleep i
[02:54:25.240 --> 02:54:28.920]  mean i it's weird when you don't get sleep we're almost more hyper
[02:54:28.920 --> 02:54:31.800]  early in the day but then later you're like brain dead that's how i'm starting
[02:54:31.800 --> 02:54:34.840]  to feel right now so the show has been a bit all over the
[02:54:34.840 --> 02:54:38.680]  map today i think the point i was getting to though
[02:54:38.680 --> 02:54:42.600]  about having a cop in east texas want to rob the money out of my wallet for no
[02:54:42.600 --> 02:54:45.080]  reason in a small town and then another one
[02:54:45.080 --> 02:54:49.880]  letting me and my buddy go because
[02:54:50.680 --> 02:54:54.600]  he was a racist and well what happens when the towns are all hispanic they're
[02:54:54.600 --> 02:54:58.120]  only going to give whites tickets or i mean it's i don't want to live in a
[02:54:58.120 --> 02:55:01.480]  country where they're pulling black people over and giving them tickets
[02:55:01.480 --> 02:55:05.080]  because they're black or i drive into a black town and i get
[02:55:05.080 --> 02:55:09.160]  mugged and killed because i'm white well white treat us bad so i'm going to
[02:55:09.160 --> 02:55:12.040]  kill you it's it's just like i want to live
[02:55:12.040 --> 02:55:15.640]  somewhere where people are treated off what they stand for
[02:55:15.640 --> 02:55:19.000]  and not stereotypes but then the so-called left
[02:55:19.000 --> 02:55:21.880]  thinks they've captured the moral high ground saying that when they're the
[02:55:21.880 --> 02:55:28.120]  ones pushing it more than any Ku Klux Klan ever could
[02:55:28.120 --> 02:55:32.040]  and i've now gone full circle from abola and africa and the epidemic
[02:55:32.040 --> 02:55:36.440]  to uh you know going off into police all over the country
[02:55:36.440 --> 02:55:39.640]  now now state police mainline police forces
[02:55:39.640 --> 02:55:43.080]  are robbing money out of your wallet that's a lot of money
[02:55:43.080 --> 02:55:48.200]  they're taking as little as five hundred dollars now
[02:55:49.560 --> 02:55:53.080]  and it is highway robbery and it is criminal i'm not evil because i want to
[02:55:53.080 --> 02:55:55.720]  carry some cash
[02:55:55.720 --> 02:55:59.480]  sometimes i give family and their stockings and stuff for christmas i'll
[02:55:59.480 --> 02:56:02.360]  get two or three thousand dollars out of the bank and you know give all the
[02:56:02.360 --> 02:56:05.800]  kids and cousins and the family two hundred bucks or whatever
[02:56:05.800 --> 02:56:08.920]  i mean am i bad when i'm carrying around two thousand dollars on me
[02:56:08.920 --> 02:56:13.800]  i don't usually mean no it's my money and don't give me your fake drug war
[02:56:13.800 --> 02:56:17.160]  excuse when the government ships in the majority of it and i've got a whole
[02:56:17.160 --> 02:56:21.480]  bunch of news articles today about bank of america city bank you name it caught
[02:56:21.480 --> 02:56:27.960]  laundering billions in drug money

[02:58:24.200 --> 02:58:27.640]  there it's because the taylo's phone system that most
[02:58:27.640 --> 02:58:32.440]  stations have makes a noise when it goes to you and people think they've
[02:58:32.440 --> 02:58:35.880]  been disconnected i i hate that phone system
[02:58:35.880 --> 02:58:40.200]  because of that but it's industry standard it works well
[02:58:40.200 --> 02:58:45.320]  it's a very nice phone system but for 19 years on air is it gcmi i have to deal
[02:58:45.320 --> 02:58:48.520]  with people wondering what that sound is that's why i'm irritated not with you

[03:00:22.280 --> 03:00:25.400]  there's a lot of news breaking on the abola front you name it we'll be covering
[03:00:25.400 --> 03:00:28.360]  it tonight seven o'clock central info wars nightly news
[03:00:28.360 --> 03:00:33.880]  going back to frogo in england what's your bottom line on scottish
[03:00:33.880 --> 03:00:37.080]  independence i have said i'm all for scotland being independent from the
[03:00:37.080 --> 03:00:41.000]  uk because the uk is already under e u control to begin with
[03:00:41.000 --> 03:00:46.040]  you've almost got to devolve to be able to evolve in these political systems now
[03:00:46.040 --> 03:00:50.200]  uh and it's there right but yes there are a lot of big megabanks and others
[03:00:50.200 --> 03:00:53.240]  that are even you know bigger than the uk itself
[03:00:53.240 --> 03:00:57.080]  they're going to come in and try to loot scotland afterwards what's your take on
[03:00:57.080 --> 03:00:58.680]  it
[03:00:58.680 --> 03:01:05.880]  um scottish quote independence unquote is a screwjob of obama care proportions
[03:01:05.880 --> 03:01:10.360]  is it not weird uh cameron is claiming that he's in favor of preserving the
[03:01:10.360 --> 03:01:14.520]  union that he's the man who pushed for the referendum
[03:01:14.520 --> 03:01:19.320]  um when the s n p had been pumping that line for
[03:01:19.320 --> 03:01:24.680]  about 30 years that i can remember well is that because it'll get rid of
[03:01:24.680 --> 03:01:27.640]  labor voters and he thinks it'll help this party
[03:01:27.640 --> 03:01:32.920]  it totally got it it will kind of decimate the labor party's chances of
[03:01:32.920 --> 03:01:37.000]  winning an election in what's left of the uk it will mean
[03:01:37.000 --> 03:01:40.680]  permanent Tory government in england and wales
[03:01:40.680 --> 03:01:44.360]  it will also mean permanent Tory government in scotland
[03:01:44.360 --> 03:01:48.920]  because the only serious opposition to the labor party for the last 20 years
[03:01:48.920 --> 03:01:53.320]  is the s n b now if i were the Tory party
[03:01:53.320 --> 03:01:58.120]  if i were a Tory central office i would observe the steady decline in the
[03:01:58.120 --> 03:02:00.840]  fortunes of the party in scotland it used to be
[03:02:00.840 --> 03:02:07.880]  um uh one of a Tory heartland and rubano law Tory prime minister had a
[03:02:07.880 --> 03:02:12.280]  constituency in dwellsgoe and somehow the party went from
[03:02:12.280 --> 03:02:16.360]  doing quite nicely there to having zero seats if i
[03:02:16.360 --> 03:02:19.960]  well i mean there's no doubt they're going to try to screw
[03:02:19.960 --> 03:02:24.840]  different globalist interest will try to screw any new deal that comes up i
[03:02:24.840 --> 03:02:28.440]  hear you i just fundamentally if texas tries to
[03:02:28.440 --> 03:02:31.800]  secede there'll be some scam involved to take that over
[03:02:31.800 --> 03:02:35.160]  anything and everything will get manipulated but we're going to find out
[03:02:35.160 --> 03:02:40.120]  very soon i do see what you're saying i am aware of what you're saying
[03:02:40.120 --> 03:02:42.600]  that's how i was able to predict what you were about to say i just want to show
[03:02:42.600 --> 03:02:45.800]  that i know uk politics a little bit i'm not just talking out of my you know what
[03:02:45.800 --> 03:02:49.960]  here arse as they would say in scotland but thank you so much look i'm
[03:02:49.960 --> 03:02:53.320]  basically out of time one more call paul in
[03:02:53.320 --> 03:02:59.880]  california sorry to debbie tj and jp paul you're our tail gunner go ahead
[03:02:59.880 --> 03:03:04.920]  uh thanks um i think you know money's important the truth is important
[03:03:04.920 --> 03:03:10.920]  and the easiest thing for us to get them waiting for a shoe to drop is attack
[03:03:10.920 --> 03:03:15.960]  them and that's true out at the fed i agree and ron paul's bill even though
[03:03:15.960 --> 03:03:18.360]  he's not in congress is back in the house again
[03:03:18.360 --> 03:03:23.480]  getting a lot of votes yeah we need to get them worried as opposed to us being
[03:03:23.480 --> 03:03:26.760]  worried about all of the stuff they're throwing at us
[03:03:26.760 --> 03:03:31.480]  and i think that the out at the fed is the way
[03:03:31.480 --> 03:03:35.000]  good point sir i want to go to jp real quick since he's still there
[03:03:35.000 --> 03:03:40.680]  i didn't know the feds purchased the bio dome uh jp tell me about that
[03:03:40.680 --> 03:03:44.840]  well in february of this year i i was doing some work
[03:03:44.840 --> 03:03:48.920]  for a production company looking for new shows in north carolina because it's a
[03:03:48.920 --> 03:03:53.720]  hospital i was doing on some virus i came across this uh company called the
[03:03:53.720 --> 03:03:57.400]  bio dome and this interesting guy i started talking to him
[03:03:57.400 --> 03:04:02.120]  he came up with a filtration system that he had the government the military
[03:04:02.120 --> 03:04:06.120]  test test test test and it blew away anything that they had
[03:04:06.120 --> 03:04:11.000]  so even the the inspector for the for the military okay when you said bio dome i
[03:04:11.000 --> 03:04:13.560]  thought you meant that thing that nasa was involved in
[03:04:13.560 --> 03:04:17.720]  to test a mars base you're talking about some kind of filter
[03:04:17.720 --> 03:04:24.840]  exactly and bottom line is he got a military contract to uh supply every
[03:04:24.840 --> 03:04:29.480]  any vehicle that the government had with these bio and he was just he said look
