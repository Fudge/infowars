[00:00.000 --> 00:16.600]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well
[00:16.600 --> 00:34.260]  so does he live from the info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones ladies and gentlemen it is
[00:34.260 --> 00:40.320]  Friday September 27th 2019 the deep state is behind this attempted coup on Trump they're
[00:40.320 --> 00:44.480]  moving forward with the impeachment whether they don't have any evidence or not and they
[00:44.480 --> 00:49.440]  were even proven to be involved in a giant hoax with the Ukraine situation but Pelosi
[00:49.440 --> 00:53.480]  says they've got lots of reasons and they want to have the articles forward for a vote
[00:53.480 --> 00:58.680]  by Thanksgiving that's right ladies and gentlemen they want to remove Trump in the next four
[00:58.680 --> 01:02.840]  to five months this is explosive we're going to break it all down but first this report
[01:02.840 --> 01:15.200]  we are law-abiding responsible gun owners and please don't legislate the 150 million
[01:15.200 --> 01:21.320]  people just like me into being criminals like his almost it has happened you've already
[01:21.320 --> 01:28.000]  done it the legislation on bump stocks I was a bump stock owner and I had to make a decision
[01:28.000 --> 01:34.240]  be do I become a felon or do I comply and like that gentleman that just got escorted
[01:34.240 --> 01:42.160]  out I will not comply the hearing on so-called assault weapons drew a line in the sand the
[01:42.160 --> 01:47.920]  Democrats want your president they want you taxed to death and they want your guns leading
[01:47.920 --> 02:09.840]  the charge politicians who know little to nothing about firearms clearly define those
[02:09.840 --> 02:16.360]  characteristics that define an assault weapon and assault weapons also include assault pistols
[02:16.360 --> 02:21.920]  and assault shotguns then we'll be on much firmer footing and that would that would eliminate
[02:21.920 --> 02:27.320]  these with these with these weapons that we commonly refer to as assault weapons and that
[02:27.320 --> 02:33.160]  can cause these mass casualties I would like to you know ask you know some of the people
[02:33.160 --> 02:41.560]  who support banning quote assault rifles to tell me and you know do you think that hunting
[02:41.560 --> 02:47.080]  rifles ought to be banned I believe any weapon that can be used to hunt individuals should
[02:47.080 --> 02:52.600]  be banned you said that anything used to hunt people should be banned is that correct any
[02:52.600 --> 02:59.320]  weapon that can be used to hunt individuals should be banned okay so you then stand for
[02:59.320 --> 03:03.640]  the proposition to ban any type of firearm because any type of firearm could be used
[03:03.640 --> 03:10.400]  to misuse and kill people as I stated before with law enforcement in particular there is
[03:10.400 --> 03:16.120]  a social contract that we have in asking based on your statement you said that anything used
[03:16.120 --> 03:21.120]  to hunt people should be banned that's what you stated you just said all so I'm clarifying
[03:21.120 --> 03:25.120]  your statement today is that all firearms because they can be used to hunt people should
[03:25.120 --> 03:29.240]  be banned that's your state your statement before this committee so that is not my statement
[03:29.240 --> 03:32.960]  so you haven't clarified my statement sir you've just added a statement you Mr. Chairman
[03:32.960 --> 03:38.320]  and I don't necessarily profess to be an expert in hunting vomit but my general sense is that
[03:38.320 --> 03:42.200]  if you're hitting them with AK-15 you're not hunting them you're killing them and that's
[03:42.200 --> 03:49.720]  the only purpose of of doing it Larry Elder writing for real clear politics asks how many
[03:49.720 --> 03:56.800]  are saved every year by guns almost all national survey estimates indicate that defensive gun
[03:56.800 --> 04:03.240]  uses by victims are at least as common as offensive uses by criminals with estimates
[04:03.240 --> 04:10.960]  of annual uses ranging from about 500,000 to more than 3 million per year 20 years ago
[04:10.960 --> 04:17.360]  economist John Lott author of more guns less crime wrote we find that allowing citizens
[04:17.360 --> 04:23.560]  to carry concealed weapons deters and it appears to produce no increase in accidental deaths
[04:23.560 --> 04:28.560]  if those states which did not have right to carry concealed gun provisions had adopted
[04:28.560 --> 04:40.240]  them back in 1992 approximately 1,570 murders 4,177 rapes and over 60,000 aggravated assaults
[04:40.240 --> 04:47.160]  would have been avoided yearly the democrats lean on totalitarianism as a solution a solution
[04:47.160 --> 04:53.080]  to increase their own power and control which is why we need to protect our second amendment
[04:53.080 --> 05:01.120]  rights now more than ever John bound reporting do you feel that my style is wrong or my substance
[05:01.120 --> 05:06.320]  is wrong trying to fact check the present the deceptive Humpty Dumpty troll known as
[05:06.320 --> 05:12.320]  Brian Stelter his little weasel minion Oliver Darcy have made it their life's mission to
[05:12.320 --> 05:16.920]  take patriots off the air in a censor us and of course he famously settled on many others
[05:16.920 --> 05:22.400]  that trump is the info wars president trump's furious reaction to facebook's action showcases
[05:22.400 --> 05:28.560]  that he is I'm sorry to say that info wars president and you know what is true our audience
[05:28.560 --> 05:33.880]  of activists our guest our crew and my drive and your drive has brought trump the white
[05:33.880 --> 05:37.760]  house and other nationalists to power around the world and now trumps openly coming out
[05:37.760 --> 05:42.560]  declaring war on these globalist tyrants and their unelected anti-human tyrannies so this
[05:42.560 --> 05:47.720]  is a day of great victory and I salute you all but now in the thick of the fight so info
[05:47.720 --> 05:52.840]  wars store dot com for products you need massive sales now so we can continue on to the future
[05:52.840 --> 05:57.400]  and give these bastards one hell of a fight right until the end until we've defeated them
[05:57.400 --> 06:19.400]  I miss long beach and I miss you I miss dancing with you the most of all I miss the bar where
[06:19.400 --> 06:29.960]  Dennis's last stop before come on those nights we're on fire we couldn't get high we didn't
[06:29.960 --> 06:38.960]  know that we had it all but nobody wants you before the fall
[06:38.960 --> 06:46.680]  Ladies and gentlemen we're live broadcasting worldwide on this Friday already 27th day
[06:46.680 --> 06:52.000]  of September 2019 I'm gonna be here for the next four hours live I've got Nick Baggins
[06:52.000 --> 06:57.360]  joining us we have constitutional lawyer Robert Barnes studio we also have famous criminal
[06:57.360 --> 07:03.640]  and first amendment lawyer civil rights lawyer norm paddice joining us because there was
[07:03.640 --> 07:10.000]  a public interest appeal at the supreme court of Connecticut yesterday dealing with the
[07:10.000 --> 07:20.680]  railroading that I am enjoying with the democratic party law firm there in there in Connecticut
[07:20.680 --> 07:26.040]  and it was pretty explosive pretty powerful statements the kind of stuff you see in movies
[07:26.040 --> 07:30.920]  not the stuff you usually see in courtrooms this is pretty dramatic stuff we're gonna
[07:30.920 --> 07:35.400]  look at that coming up at the bottom of the hour play some of those clips from inside
[07:35.400 --> 07:40.480]  the supreme court there in Connecticut and then we're going to obviously move into the
[07:40.480 --> 07:46.200]  whole attempt to remove Trump from office it has been announced that the democrats want
[07:46.200 --> 07:54.040]  to bring forward articles of impeachment one way or another by Thanksgiving and they would
[07:54.040 --> 08:02.000]  like to have already had a vote and president Trump removed from office by Christmas as
[08:02.000 --> 08:07.440]  a present to the American people these are all statements that have been made Hillary
[08:07.440 --> 08:13.240]  Clinton has come out and called Trump a clear and present danger to the country this is
[08:13.240 --> 08:21.280]  because he is rolling up the chai com spy grid that had taken control the U.S. he is
[08:21.280 --> 08:29.200]  ending our economic surrender to China and the globalist combine the actual traders
[08:29.200 --> 08:38.920]  are very upset their gravy train is in danger and so a secret agent man from the CIA inside
[08:38.920 --> 08:46.320]  the White House is the whistleblower that heard this not second hand but of course third
[08:46.320 --> 08:54.680]  hand ladies and gentlemen that the president had done quid pro quo I'll give you this if
[08:54.680 --> 09:00.480]  you give me that none of it's true they released a transcript but that didn't stop the head
[09:00.480 --> 09:10.200]  of the committee Mr. Besser chef to read in his opening statement a fake transcript and
[09:10.200 --> 09:20.560]  only later admit that it was a fake transcript and that didn't stop people like good old
[09:20.560 --> 09:31.680]  Joe Scarborough from tweeting on another fake transcript and it's all being done on purpose
[09:31.680 --> 09:46.600]  all being done just to confuse everybody and to put all this mud up into the atmosphere
[09:46.600 --> 09:52.640]  and into the air because they never get held accountable these criminals who would ever
[09:52.640 --> 10:01.880]  they want whenever they want however they want shock and all Democrats are rushing
[10:01.880 --> 10:07.720]  to have articles of impeachment ready for a vote around Thanksgiving complaint in hand
[10:07.720 --> 10:15.400]  Democrats aim for a fast and focused impeachment inquiry they want the articles by Thanksgiving
[10:15.400 --> 10:21.840]  Trump says shift must resign to be investigated for reading a fake transcript of Trump's conversation
[10:21.840 --> 10:27.820]  with the Ukrainian president shifts retelling of Trump phone call with Ukraine head gets
[10:27.820 --> 10:35.280]  mocked as unhinged orange man bad fan fiction again these stories are all upon info wars
[10:35.280 --> 10:42.040]  dot com and news wars dot com moron psycho Joe Scarborough tweets satire Trump Ukraine
[10:42.040 --> 10:49.240]  transcript as if it's real meanwhile dossier 2.0 whistleblower complaint relies on Soros
[10:49.240 --> 10:56.400]  funded investigative reporting close quote group that partnered with Buzzfeed on Piscay
[10:56.400 --> 11:00.360]  Trump properly warns that if they impeach him or try to remove him from office it could
[11:00.360 --> 11:09.800]  cause a stock market crash meanwhile shocked new survey finds Americans are completely
[11:09.800 --> 11:18.160]  unprepared for a recession or a depression but that's okay report hundreds of documents
[11:18.160 --> 11:22.840]  can flick with Joe Biden's account of why Ukraine prosecutor was fired Kelly's on TV
[11:22.840 --> 11:27.040]  saying if you don't fire him I'll keep a million dollars back that's totally illegal regardless
[11:27.040 --> 11:33.960]  of why they removed him let's see when you piss in our face in plain view and it's open
[11:33.960 --> 11:38.440]  and shut case then you don't get in trouble but when it's made about Trump it's all breathless
[11:38.440 --> 11:49.080]  we gotta get him right now so this is a complete charade you've got Omar and AOC running around
[11:49.080 --> 11:54.600]  foaming at the mouth so happy all this is going on but you've got Democrat privilege
[11:54.600 --> 12:00.440]  two months after Hunter Biden discharged from the Navy for cocaine use he's put on board
[12:00.440 --> 12:06.600]  of largest oil and gas company in Ukraine to funnel money back to daddy Mitt Romney's
[12:06.600 --> 12:13.920]  folks and everybody else but then you've got the Trump support treatment corrupt judge
[12:13.920 --> 12:20.280]  Amy Berman that's Obama's hanging judge Jackson bars Roger Stone defense from trying the case
[12:20.280 --> 12:25.520]  to Russian hackers they admitted in court there's no evidence of any Russian hackers
[12:25.520 --> 12:33.200]  of the DNC it's made up like Kavanaugh raping women it's all made up in a big article in
[12:33.200 --> 12:39.240]  the Washington Times Trump's earliest GOP backers fallen hard times and it gets into
[12:39.240 --> 12:45.040]  how everybody gets arrested and died in bankrupted sued I'm not a victim but I'm left out of
[12:45.040 --> 12:49.160]  the article meanwhile the Kremlin's come out and said something really important they said
[12:49.160 --> 12:53.480]  we thought there's executive privilege we thought our phone calls with the president
[12:53.480 --> 12:58.480]  are private I mean we're not releasing phone calls from Nancy Pelosi so we're not gonna
[12:58.480 --> 13:02.840]  talk to Trump on the phone of it's just released to the public that's private conversations
[13:02.840 --> 13:07.600]  presidents should be able to talk to each other you know privacy so you can really have
[13:07.600 --> 13:13.520]  discussions see the idea of Trump having any diplomacy or any detente or any communication
[13:13.520 --> 13:19.160]  is illegal you see hell if he's in public and shakes Putin's hand at a g20 or g8 oh
[13:19.160 --> 13:25.320]  my gosh you see the treason they're trying to paralyze the president we're gonna be looking

[19:14.640 --> 19:23.320]  He's promised to do the speech at the UN is as important as Eisenhower's military industrial complex beware their tyranny speech
[19:23.320 --> 19:26.960]  We talked about technological elite. He came out and he exposed
[19:27.360 --> 19:32.720]  How big tech is a new ruling class that is manipulating the minds of the people and engaging in
[19:33.320 --> 19:39.380]  Massive oppression and he talked about how globalism is not the future of the world and
[19:39.380 --> 19:47.220]  Trump has done a great job exposing the UN the globalist and the chai comms in their house that the Rockefeller set up in New York
[19:47.300 --> 19:49.780]  The UN this was incredible
[19:50.740 --> 19:53.820]  The future does not belong to globalists
[19:54.540 --> 19:56.780]  The future belongs to patriots
[19:56.780 --> 20:05.340]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[20:27.780 --> 20:35.100]  I'm gonna live forever. I'm gonna cross that river. I'm gonna catch tomorrow night
[20:37.300 --> 20:44.300]  You're gonna want to hold me just like I always told you you're gonna miss me when I'm gone
[20:46.660 --> 20:49.460]  Nobody here will never find me
[20:51.020 --> 20:53.520]  But I will always be around
[20:53.520 --> 20:55.520]  Yeah
[20:55.680 --> 20:58.680]  Just like the songs I leave behind me
[21:00.200 --> 21:03.640]  I'm gonna live forever now. Now here's the key
[21:13.920 --> 21:20.600]  You fathers and you mothers be good to one another please try to raise your children
[21:20.600 --> 21:22.600]  Right
[21:23.120 --> 21:30.040]  Don't let the darkness take on don't make them feel for a second. Just leave them safely to the line
[21:30.320 --> 21:32.560]  Don't let the darkness take
[21:33.800 --> 21:36.100]  Don't let them feel forsaken
[21:37.120 --> 21:40.360]  Everybody always knew the darkness comes trying to take your children
[21:41.440 --> 21:48.120]  The doctor spock and all the leftist armies in the 50s and 60s told us let your children be who they want to be
[21:48.120 --> 21:50.120]  Don't teach them anything
[21:50.680 --> 21:52.680]  Let the television
[21:52.680 --> 21:56.600]  Raise them. I'm gonna cross that and now Nambla is in the schools
[21:57.640 --> 21:59.640]  Now even conservatives
[22:00.200 --> 22:02.040]  adopt
[22:02.040 --> 22:04.040]  Whatever language
[22:04.720 --> 22:06.720]  We're told and
[22:07.040 --> 22:09.040]  Whatever we're given
[22:09.760 --> 22:11.760]  We don't call illegal aliens
[22:11.760 --> 22:19.000]  Illegals anymore. We call them migrants and then under the UN treaty. They're allowed to come and get everything free
[22:20.080 --> 22:22.080]  even the blaze and
[22:22.880 --> 22:24.880]  Breitbart
[22:25.120 --> 22:29.240]  I'm not even putting them down go along and use the terms we're given
[22:31.280 --> 22:35.000]  Huberti blocking drugs used to treat gender dysphoria
[22:35.000 --> 22:41.760]  In kids linked to thousands of deaths now, that's a good article exposing it's killing a bunch of people
[22:43.320 --> 22:50.320]  But you know chopping your genitals off or taking chemicals to block it because people abused you and confused you in the school and
[22:50.320 --> 22:56.480]  Gave you attention because you bought into it more than half of them are mentally retarded or autistic. That's on record
[22:56.480 --> 23:03.160]  That's called child abuse. That's called mind control. That's called sterilization. That's called experimentation
[23:04.280 --> 23:07.840]  But if you call it gender dysphoria
[23:10.080 --> 23:14.400]  Hell if you kidnap a woman maybe out of her car and rape her give it some fancy name
[23:16.040 --> 23:18.880]  Maybe call her confusion and fighting back a disease
[23:19.680 --> 23:21.680]  Then it'd be okay, right?
[23:23.320 --> 23:25.320]  Don't let the dark
[23:25.320 --> 23:27.320]  Don't let the darkness take them
[23:28.000 --> 23:32.720]  Don't let them feel forsaken. They need to know you're there for them
[23:33.880 --> 23:39.640]  That you'll kill for your children if you have to you're ready to they need to feel that
[23:41.040 --> 23:43.240]  It's like a rock. They know it's there
[23:44.040 --> 23:46.040]  First they break up the families though
[23:46.280 --> 23:52.640]  The women are all alone and the waves of corruption and drugs and culture come crashing in
[23:52.640 --> 23:57.520]  And then the gang members are there and the criminal groups are there and the leftist cults are there a
[23:58.120 --> 24:01.840]  Targeting the nerds targeting the Ashburgers targeting the autistic
[24:02.840 --> 24:05.560]  And giving them a library book when they're in fourth grade
[24:06.440 --> 24:12.200]  About the love you're gonna find it's gonna be getting the car with that man. He's gonna pull your pants down
[24:12.960 --> 24:14.960]  He's gonna suck you off and
[24:15.440 --> 24:19.440]  You're gonna be a big boy now and you know, we're on a lot of Christian stations
[24:19.440 --> 24:23.320]  But they know I'm not a Pharisee people are like that's pretty shocking to say that well
[24:23.320 --> 24:26.160]  They're teaching kids in elementary school that right now
[24:26.360 --> 24:28.840]  They have known killers convicted murderers
[24:29.280 --> 24:35.360]  That have TV shows with little kids that dance half naked in front of men put them on screen right now if you're a TV viewer
[24:36.480 --> 24:40.600]  It's praised on ABC and NBC and CBS is a wonderful thing
[24:41.160 --> 24:47.160]  They've got books in children schools from Australia to the US teaching children
[24:47.160 --> 24:48.960]  with
[24:48.960 --> 24:50.960]  hardcore
[24:51.680 --> 24:58.920]  Literature if you call it that about people who were abused as children and how great it was and again
[24:59.520 --> 25:02.600]  Three years ago and two years ago the Boy Scout Jamboree
[25:02.960 --> 25:10.600]  The leftist handed out 10,000 condoms to people as young as ten years old and they wondered why there's hundreds of lawsuits now and
[25:11.000 --> 25:13.000]  Diseases and kids got HIV
[25:13.000 --> 25:17.600]  And you're like that's crazy. Why would they do it because it's a religious right of
[25:18.560 --> 25:26.080]  Satanism to corrupt children like a boarding party a ship slamming in to another ship and pirates pouring off
[25:30.840 --> 25:33.000]  They mean to take down the Boy Scouts
[25:33.120 --> 25:38.640]  They mean to take down the Catholic Church and the Protestant Church and the Orthodox Church and the universities
[25:38.640 --> 25:42.080]  These are cults that seek power
[25:45.480 --> 25:51.880]  To defile and ruin and steal the life force of children and to wreck their trajectory
[25:52.560 --> 25:55.960]  there's a child fired by their parents and
[25:56.680 --> 25:58.680]  by the community
[25:58.960 --> 26:03.920]  And supposedly the real community not the system of the corporate evil, but the real community that's gone
[26:04.480 --> 26:06.920]  Where are the barbecues? Where are the neighbors looking out for each other?
[26:06.920 --> 26:09.400]  Where are the farming communities? Where is it? It's all gone
[26:10.280 --> 26:12.680]  That's like setting a arrow
[26:13.960 --> 26:21.720]  To your bow pulling back and then releasing and when you release that arrow properly done
[26:21.800 --> 26:29.120]  The trajectory of life is true and strong and productive and hits the bullseye, but if they can get into those children
[26:29.120 --> 26:37.080]  When they're little and put the dyes in the food and the vaccines with the with the adjuvants and hurt them and twist them
[26:37.080 --> 26:40.200]  And then program them. They'll never know what hit them
[26:41.320 --> 26:48.920]  Don't let the darkness take them. Don't let them feel forsaken. Well, that's exactly what's happening now
[26:52.840 --> 26:54.840]  Daily wire got it right with their headline
[26:55.680 --> 26:58.080]  puberty blocking chemicals kill thousands
[26:58.080 --> 27:04.360]  Not puberty blocking drugs used to treat gender dysphoria in kids linked to thousands of deaths
[27:04.760 --> 27:08.040]  Hey, why don't we just give what Hitler did a medical land? I don't make it. Okay?
[27:10.480 --> 27:17.440]  So military sees frustrating trend is suicide spike already AP reports above the previous record
[27:17.440 --> 27:26.480]  And they go up and up and up and up and up and then 24 veterans kill themselves every day that number's up
[27:28.320 --> 27:32.320]  Don't let the darkness take them. Don't let them feel forsaken
[27:38.480 --> 27:43.840]  Because when you don't feel like you're part of a community and doing good and you don't feel like you have any worth you kill yourself
[27:43.840 --> 27:50.160]  Especially white males and veterans and police are told they're crap. They're evil. They're trash. They know it's not true
[27:50.360 --> 27:56.160]  They're put on psychotropic drugs that kill you that make you commit suicide that make you lose your connection to God
[27:57.880 --> 28:02.480]  What all these people need to do is go out and help others and
[28:04.360 --> 28:09.920]  Decide the enemy the global is trying to program you to kill yourself with a hero young person an old person a veteran
[28:09.920 --> 28:15.720]  Doesn't matter that you're not gonna let them win and instead of feeling empty because the war is over and
[28:17.360 --> 28:19.360]  It's all over for the unknown soldier
[28:20.560 --> 28:27.240]  Bullet strikes the helmet's head. It's all over for the unknown soldier
[28:27.240 --> 28:33.200]  But it's not over the fights now against the global surrounding our free speech and trying to take our second amendment
[28:33.200 --> 28:38.920]  And trying to overthrow our elected president and trying to drive us into submission and so instead of running from that weight
[28:38.920 --> 28:43.800]  We need to lean into it and get stronger as we fight and then we won't want to commit suicide
[28:44.400 --> 28:46.400]  Don't want to live for as long as possible
[28:47.000 --> 28:49.000]  To fight and resist and be strong
[28:49.480 --> 28:54.640]  And we're going to do it. We're gonna defeat the Satanist their will is not as strong as ours and they know it

[32:57.900 --> 33:03.980]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[33:13.420 --> 33:17.860]  The following report is a lot bigger than Alex Jones yours truly are info wars
[33:18.140 --> 33:20.140]  It's about a fight to remove
[33:20.420 --> 33:26.340]  The first amendment the very same offer that successfully bankrupted the Alex Jones show
[33:26.340 --> 33:28.340]  Because there is a war on
[33:30.140 --> 33:33.140]  The same law firm that successfully bankrupted Remington
[33:34.340 --> 33:39.980]  Now has the sights on the most powerful law firm in Connecticut as its fangs and its claws out
[33:40.540 --> 33:44.060]  Licking its lips and even in front of the Supreme Court of the state yesterday
[33:44.060 --> 33:50.060]  They kept saying we can't violate its free speech right you you you want us to throw back this appeal saying he didn't
[33:50.780 --> 33:53.180]  Do what he was supposed to on discovery
[33:53.180 --> 33:57.380]  The cost off cost off and cost off said no
[33:58.020 --> 34:05.140]  It's a speech. It's not protected. He's a bad man. They actually said that you know, that doesn't make sense
[34:05.140 --> 34:07.540]  That's that's unconstitutional. That's the goal
[34:08.420 --> 34:13.900]  Overturn it all while getting awards for being a constitutionalist at the same time
[34:14.380 --> 34:20.700]  That's the sick joke. Here's the local Fox report and we'll talk to norm paddice who gave the oral argument on my behalf
[34:20.700 --> 34:26.300]  Right now Sandy Hook families are taking on Alex Jones at the state's highest court
[34:26.460 --> 34:28.300]  Jones didn't appear in court today
[34:28.300 --> 34:34.580]  But the families did as the free speech case against the controversial conspiracy theorists took another twisted turn
[34:34.700 --> 34:39.220]  Fox 61's Matt Karen live outside of the state Supreme Court with an update Matt
[34:40.660 --> 34:47.180]  Well today Alex Jones's attorney norm paddice argued that Bridgeport trial judge Barbara
[34:47.180 --> 34:52.500]  Bellas's decision to sanction Jones for his recent comments was unwarranted
[34:54.860 --> 35:00.740]  The first amendment on trial and they say that's me he threatened me the honorable Supreme Court
[35:00.740 --> 35:07.580]  The state of Connecticut is now open the state highest court heard arguments in the defamation lawsuit brought by Sandy Hook family members
[35:07.820 --> 35:13.380]  Against conspiracy theorist Alex Jones who for years said the school massacre was a hoax
[35:13.380 --> 35:20.380]  Alex Jones speaks in the vein of conspiracy theorists as conspiracy theorists have spoken in this country since the founding
[35:20.660 --> 35:26.540]  Thursday's arguments centering around alleged threats Jones made on his info wars internet broadcast
[35:26.940 --> 35:32.220]  Against Sandy Hook family attorney Chris Maddie. We addressed it by enhancing some security
[35:32.620 --> 35:36.620]  Around our office. There was no threat here. Chris Maddie's no wallflower
[35:36.620 --> 35:39.380]  Whatever we've had to deal with either me personally or as a firm
[35:39.380 --> 35:46.300]  Pails in comparison to the abuse that he unleashed on the people standing behind me those Sandy Hook family members
[35:46.380 --> 35:51.020]  Decline to speak inside the court Maddie's counterpart Joshua Coss Cops
[35:51.500 --> 35:58.060]  spirited exchange with Justice Steven Ecker. This case is a loaded case. Your firm brought the case
[35:58.820 --> 36:00.500]  against a
[36:00.500 --> 36:04.540]  known conspiracy theorist with a big microphone
[36:04.540 --> 36:10.060]  And you knew that when you did that you were getting into a war
[36:10.100 --> 36:16.820]  The court is implying that we have to accept that if you want to bring a case against somebody that is
[36:16.820 --> 36:21.300]  You believe is worthy of bringing a case against and it has done an injustice to you
[36:21.340 --> 36:27.340]  You better think twice because you have to accept that we as the court are going to treat that person differently
[36:27.340 --> 36:34.140]  Because you got what you asked for and that is the implication and it in fact a court should do the opposite
[36:34.580 --> 36:42.380]  Jones made his comments following the discovery that child porn was attached to emails sent from Jones to Sandy Hook family
[36:42.380 --> 36:47.980]  Attorneys as part of the evidence discovery process. Whoever was responsible for that child pornography
[36:47.980 --> 36:51.260]  He'd like to see that person's head on a pike. That is hyperbole
[36:51.260 --> 36:56.340]  Now the justices made no ruling today
[36:56.340 --> 37:00.340]  But the trial court judge did previously rule that Jones and Patis
[37:00.660 --> 37:06.380]  Stonewalled the court and the defense by not producing evidence documents and handing them over
[37:06.860 --> 37:12.220]  Patis meanwhile is arguing arguing that they did produce 57,000 emails
[37:13.340 --> 37:17.980]  Alright, we're gonna talk about this a little bit in the next hour then I get into all the big impeachment news the military news
[37:17.980 --> 37:22.220]  The economy news is just the incredible state this country said we have to understand
[37:22.900 --> 37:24.900]  everyone that supported President Trump
[37:25.940 --> 37:27.940]  In his initial run
[37:27.940 --> 37:34.420]  In 2015 2016 has been either put in prison or they've tried to put him in prison or they've been sued dozens of times
[37:34.700 --> 37:37.700]  They have been bankrupt that they've been attacked that that's all over the news
[37:37.700 --> 37:41.380]  And that's what this is and the Sandy Hook parents God bless them
[37:41.740 --> 37:45.660]  They go on the news all the time and say he's attacking us. He's coming after us
[37:45.660 --> 37:48.460]  He won't stop sending people to our houses
[37:49.020 --> 37:53.420]  One of the women I sued two days ago running for Congress in Massachusetts
[37:53.660 --> 37:56.580]  She says that I said kill the Sandy Hook kids
[37:56.740 --> 38:02.660]  So they're just escalating this when I barely ever hardly even talked about it plus. It's free speech. So
[38:03.180 --> 38:10.380]  That's how they got me deplatformed and it's the Democrats damaging me with this using kids as a human shield by Greta Thunberg
[38:10.380 --> 38:16.940]  To do that and so we have some astounding clips from the two hours of oral argument in the court
[38:17.700 --> 38:22.020]  The court was going to rule but then said no we can't rule that was pretty ominous for the other side
[38:22.260 --> 38:24.260]  But this is a big deal
[38:24.980 --> 38:29.820]  This is a big deal for the First Amendment and when you read what they're saying and what they're doing
[38:29.820 --> 38:34.460]  They're really trying to overturn the First Amendment even even NPR had a big report on that on Monday
[38:34.460 --> 38:40.940]  Saying well the First Amendment's in trouble in this country. Well, yeah, and the left is leading the charge to get rid of it
[38:40.940 --> 38:47.060]  So one of the most famous First Amendment lawyers in the country norm paddice joins us now to talk about what he witnessed yesterday
[38:47.060 --> 38:50.860]  We're gonna play some of these really intriguing clips that it's a lot better than the stuff
[38:50.860 --> 38:56.060]  You usually see on court TV back when it was around norm. Thanks for joining us. Thanks for having me Alex
[38:57.020 --> 38:59.940]  But yesterday was a very significant day
[38:59.940 --> 39:06.540]  We were we argued that whatever speech you uttered against mr. Maddy was not defamatory. It was not a threat
[39:06.540 --> 39:13.380]  It was vigorous angry speech by a person named Lee you or it was a grieved and had
[39:13.620 --> 39:20.540]  Suspicions the sandy hook lawyers shocked me at one point. They stood in front of the court and said Alex Jones is a bad man
[39:20.540 --> 39:26.060]  As though somehow their opinion of your moral worth if that's what they meant by that
[39:26.060 --> 39:31.420]  Warranted or justified silencing your speech, but at one point I stood in front of the court
[39:31.420 --> 39:37.140]  I said I would rather stand beside Alex Jones and just about any dispute then in next to some
[39:37.380 --> 39:43.660]  Officious inter meddler who's acting as a censor, but I think the court heard that it was a difficult argument
[39:43.660 --> 39:49.780]  We were set to be there only for an hour. All the justices had a lot of questions. It's what lawyers call a hot panel
[39:50.300 --> 39:55.220]  You know, we are waiting for a decision. It could come out this afternoon. It could come out weeks from now
[39:55.220 --> 40:02.260]  In my view, there's no dispute on this record that Judge Bellis was and in the other side admitted it
[40:02.260 --> 40:07.380]  Kasparov admitted it that Judge Bellis was animated in part by her distaste and
[40:07.820 --> 40:09.900]  Revulsion undiscussed at your speech
[40:10.460 --> 40:18.700]  That is not an adequate grounds to raise a discovery saying that and it is a chilling chilling chilling attack on the first amendment
[40:21.220 --> 40:23.220]  When are we gonna get a ruling on this
[40:23.220 --> 40:26.420]  You know, it could be it was interesting yesterday
[40:26.820 --> 40:31.180]  My general practice is the minute the gavel pounds ending the proceedings
[40:31.180 --> 40:35.540]  I've packed my briefcase up and run out the door. Nothing good ever happens in a courtroom
[40:35.540 --> 40:39.260]  So I was packing up to go and the Chief Justice looked at me and said you may want to stick around
[40:39.500 --> 40:44.980]  We may have us we may have something in 20 minutes and I looked at him as though to say really and he nodded
[40:45.340 --> 40:50.860]  So I went and waited in the lobby 20 minutes later a clerk came out to say we're not gonna have anything today
[40:50.860 --> 40:55.300]  I've been watching the docket sheets all morning to see if there's going to be a decision
[40:55.700 --> 40:58.460]  My read on the court is it's gonna be a close call
[40:59.140 --> 41:05.060]  We're likely to get a 4-3 or 5-2 ruling. I don't think it'll be unanimous and I really can't tell which way it goes
[41:05.820 --> 41:10.060]  One of the justices Justice McDonald seemed fairly hostile to our cause
[41:10.820 --> 41:17.420]  Justice Khan has been very difficult on first amendment issues over the years on the other hand justice Ecker
[41:17.420 --> 41:23.940]  Seemed to understand justice Mullen got it justice Robinson is a rule of law man who cares about respect for the law
[41:24.020 --> 41:26.920]  So, you know, I think we're in we've got a shot
[41:27.700 --> 41:32.140]  And I'm very very much hoping that we can get this case remanded
[41:32.300 --> 41:38.180]  And give you an opportunity to argue your motion to dismiss because the court at one point turned to me and said
[41:38.260 --> 41:41.740]  You know, what would be the harm if we if we denied this, you know, if mr.
[41:41.740 --> 41:45.820]  Jones just went to regular litigation and I said the whole point of the so-called
[41:45.820 --> 41:53.820]  Anti-slap statute is to protect plaintiffs or defendants rather against the crippling cost of litigation for frivolous claims
[41:53.940 --> 41:56.940]  And there this is a fundamentally frivolous claim
[41:57.620 --> 42:03.260]  Kostov's cut cut Connecticut unfair trade practice act has no support in existing law
[42:03.260 --> 42:09.220]  They are basically saying that you engage in speech they find to be offensive or their clients do at least
[42:09.460 --> 42:13.220]  And you also sell products therefore, that's an unfair trade practice
[42:13.220 --> 42:19.900]  Does that mean that we should sue the New York Times when they sell their cha-cha on their pages around the holiday globes and map and so
[42:19.900 --> 42:22.020]  Forth because we don't like the editorial policy
[42:22.020 --> 42:28.620]  It is a ridiculous and dangerous precedent this suit is I couldn't not be prouder to stand behind you and
[42:29.060 --> 42:33.380]  It's everybody's fight. We're gonna play some of these truly amazing clips
[42:33.380 --> 42:35.460]  It's like something out of a movie out of a few good men
[42:35.900 --> 42:40.660]  We come back on the other side. I don't want to make something clear to Kostov in the world and they know this
[42:40.660 --> 42:48.100]  We're not holding anything back on this cover. We gave him about a 60 something thousand emails anything with all these search terms in it
[42:48.340 --> 42:56.380]  They're demanding things that don't exist for much. Where's the marketing on Sandy Hook? Hey, you're the guys that make a living off Sandy Hook not me
[42:56.980 --> 43:01.220]  We sold secret 12 for four years and it was our number third best seller
[43:01.220 --> 43:08.140]  We had to discontinue it because when you upgrade a formula you are supposed to rename it that new formula is ultra 12
[43:08.140 --> 43:12.660]  It's twice as strong as secret 12 the very best vitamin B12 out there
[43:12.660 --> 43:17.700]  It's got the complex system that lets your body absorb it and it does amazing things

[43:24.980 --> 43:31.740]  Nervous system functioning goes on and on B12 deficiency is a serious problem that can cause anemia fatigue weakness constipation weight loss
[43:31.740 --> 43:38.780]  Depression poor memory loss asthma vision problems and low sperm count bottom line folks. You need ultra 12 it helps something in full war

[44:59.900 --> 45:05.900]  Premiers rebels and heroes who emboldened us Tuesday the 24th of September
[45:05.900 --> 45:13.900]  2019 is a historical day President Trump threw down the gauntlet and said globalism is not the future of the planet
[45:13.900 --> 45:21.900]  The future does not belong to globalists and then Trump went after them on how the chai comms are sealing our intellectual property
[45:21.900 --> 45:30.900]  Dependent on massive market barriers heavy-state subsidies currency manipulation forced technology transfers and the theft of intellectual property
[45:30.900 --> 45:37.900]  It was simply amazing and then he talked about the ruling leftist elite and their censorship and how it must be met head-on
[45:37.900 --> 45:44.900]  My administration has made clear to social media companies that we will uphold the right of free speech
[45:44.900 --> 45:53.900]  This is amazing. Find highlights and Trump's entire historic speech at info wars dot com and band dot video
[45:53.900 --> 45:57.900]  And god bless America. Thank you very much
[45:57.900 --> 46:06.900]  I was among the first 12 years ago to warn that Jeffrey Epstein was running a giant governmental blackmail ring using pedophilia
[46:06.900 --> 46:11.900]  I was the first to warn of human animal hybrids and organ harvesting
[46:11.900 --> 46:18.900]  I was the first to begin to warn that babies were being kept alive after they were born for their organs to be harvested
[46:18.900 --> 46:22.900]  I was the first to warn you along with Paul Watson and info wars dot com
[46:22.900 --> 46:28.900]  15 years ago that Google was using microphones and hidden cameras to record everything you do
[46:28.900 --> 46:32.900]  And hundreds and hundreds of other giant issues
[46:32.900 --> 46:37.900]  Like the Federal Reserve being private run for profit trying to control our economy
[46:37.900 --> 46:43.900]  That our government in Hollywood have been taken over by the Communist Chinese on every one of these issues and many others
[46:43.900 --> 46:47.900]  We've been dead on and we've raised the alarm on the planetary scale
[46:47.900 --> 46:54.900]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut us down and that's why you are more critical than ever to support the info war
[46:54.900 --> 46:57.900]  Please support the info war however you can
[46:57.900 --> 47:03.900]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[47:09.900 --> 47:16.900]  Yeah, here's our new single record from Highwayman 2 album Silver Stallion
[47:16.900 --> 47:18.900]  You
[47:25.900 --> 47:30.900]  I'm gonna steal me a silver stallion
[47:30.900 --> 47:32.900]  We're back live
[47:32.900 --> 47:37.900]  I'm your host Alex Jones, Norm Pattis is here and there's so many of these clips
[47:37.900 --> 47:42.900]  There's hours of this we're still digging around towards the last 10 minutes we're gonna get you that clip
[47:42.900 --> 47:45.900]  Where they actually say well he's a bad guy he doesn't deserve speech
[47:45.900 --> 47:47.900]  We're gonna get you that clip right now
[47:47.900 --> 47:49.900]  But let's start getting to some of these clips
[47:49.900 --> 47:51.900]  Let's go to clip 7
[47:51.900 --> 47:54.900]  This is the Democratic Party top law firm in the state
[47:54.900 --> 47:57.900]  Openly that's already bankrupted Remington
[47:57.900 --> 48:02.900]  Up there saying A that I haven't given them discovery I want to explain something
[48:02.900 --> 48:07.900]  The judge keeps saying we want the Sandy Hook marketing
[48:07.900 --> 48:11.900]  There is no Sandy Hook marketing we hardly ever talked about it
[48:11.900 --> 48:17.900]  I don't live this I'm not running for Congress like the Sandy Hook parents I'm not running charities I haven't raised millions of dollars
[48:17.900 --> 48:24.900]  Hillary Clinton looked at my whole life and said he looks weak on Sandy Hook because he used to have people on saying it didn't happen
[48:24.900 --> 48:30.900]  Now he says it happened years later let's pin it on him let's say it's his whole life and then it's their whole life
[48:30.900 --> 48:38.900]  This Costco law firm these people and the families are all fighting with each other over money and who gets it in the Bloomberg cash
[48:38.900 --> 48:43.900]  And then they keep saying Jones lives off us and then they forced me to talk about him
[48:43.900 --> 48:48.900]  But this is how the left operates it's just it's just not true and I heard the families on the news going
[48:48.900 --> 48:54.900]  He just won't stop coming after us he's sending people to our houses help us help us help us I never did any of that
[48:54.900 --> 49:04.900]  So it's really something else and it's very very dangerous so here's a clip of you can't rely on anything Jones says
[49:04.900 --> 49:12.900]  Within that week right because the hearing the broadcast was on the 14th and he's waving the Google Analytics obviously not knowing
[49:12.900 --> 49:20.900]  I mean like most favorable how clear is this what he has I mean because what wasn't there some issue about it's out with a vendor
[49:20.900 --> 49:29.900]  Well it's only not clear because Alex Jones said it and it's hard to rely on anything you're relying on it you're relying on that it's clear
[49:29.900 --> 49:37.900]  This amazing let's go to clip number one here's Norm Patis speaking about hate speech oh it's we say it's hate speech
[49:37.900 --> 49:42.900]  So magically there's no free speech there this is how they got rid of free speech in Europe in the UK and Canada
[49:42.900 --> 49:48.900]  I've been watching the campus speech cases for a number of years and I think I've argued Parnov and Taupier here
[49:48.900 --> 49:55.900]  And it's my view that the courts are perilously close to adopting something like the pornography standard for hate speech
[49:55.900 --> 50:02.900]  That they're going to say we don't know what impermissible hate speech is but when it lacks any serious artistic literary value
[50:02.900 --> 50:10.900]  Or in this case political value and it's just a rant and it's frightening we're going to prohibit it and we're going to whip by stroke of a pen
[50:10.900 --> 50:16.900]  Create a hate speech exception to the First Amendment I think that would that that is a terrifying prospect to me
[50:16.900 --> 50:20.900]  And it's what makes this case in my view so critically important
[50:20.900 --> 50:27.900]  Alex Jones speaks in the vein of conspiracy theorists as conspiracy theorists have spoken in this country since the founding
[50:27.900 --> 50:34.900]  Take your dollar bill out and look at the symbolism behind it read literally the allegations in the Declaration of Independence
[50:34.900 --> 50:42.900]  Yeah they're saying the king is conspiring to take our rights and conspiracy is two people meeting and agreeing to do something nefarious and a plan
[50:42.900 --> 50:49.900]  I mean there's thousands and thousands of people charged federally every year with conspiracy to commit this conspiracy to commit that Norm
[50:49.900 --> 50:56.900]  Absolutely I mean look the fact of the matter is we live in a world with billions of other people it's hard to come up with explanations
[50:56.900 --> 51:02.900]  Nothing is nothing is as simple as it appears and we have the right to connect dots and ways that make sense to it
[51:02.900 --> 51:10.900]  One of the things I've enjoyed about getting to know you and getting to know your show is you have a number of sources and you take risks that other people are afraid to take
[51:10.900 --> 51:17.900]  Every now and then you'll say something I'm not sure I understand it but I know it's worth looking at and I know that you didn't create your viewership
[51:17.900 --> 51:26.900]  Your viewers come to you because there's a crisis of legitimacy in this country pluralism has run its course and now we are a nation of pots saying to the potter why make us meet us
[51:26.900 --> 51:35.900]  And the center has fallen out I think you have every right to look for the center or a new center I think your viewers and listeners come to you for that
[51:35.900 --> 51:44.900]  I think that's why Donald Trump got elected now people may say oh we don't like the message it's this it's that you don't kill the messenger you argue it you debate it
[51:44.900 --> 51:50.900]  The critical question isn't why do we have Alex Jones? Why do we have Donald Trump? Why do we have this? Why do we have that?
[51:50.900 --> 51:56.900]  The critical question is if you don't like it but people are drawn to it maybe you should be asking yourself questions about your own speech
[51:56.900 --> 51:58.900]  What are you missing?
[51:58.900 --> 52:02.900]  Well exactly but let's take Adam Schiff the head of the intelligence committee
[52:02.900 --> 52:15.900]  He just came out and read a fake transcript of the president and didn't tell people till later it was fake in a giant criminal hoax but he's protected because he has the congressional immunity
[52:15.900 --> 52:25.900]  I mean that's a conspiracy right there there is a conspiracy by the Democrats to make something up on Trump the whole Russia gate it turned out was paid for and made up and a fraud
[52:25.900 --> 52:33.900]  That's a conspiracy to fraud the voters of who we elected so the idea that this law firm doesn't want us to be able to ask questions
[52:33.900 --> 52:43.900]  When so much of what we first broke from Epstein to fluoride in the water has been or fake WMDs in Iraq I said that was made up it was made up by the office of special plans
[52:43.900 --> 52:54.900]  So I mean people are crazy if they just believe what they're told but this idea now by the Democrats to throw away the first amendment to throw away the press is very dangerous
[52:54.900 --> 53:02.900]  It is and you mentioned the European example I mean in Europe you have to be careful what you say because it could offend someone it could be a crime
[53:02.900 --> 53:12.900]  Offensive speech is criminalized we've never criminalized offensive speech in the United States and the reason we've not done so is there needs to be someone who determines what is and is not offensive
[53:12.900 --> 53:16.900]  That person is the censor I do not want a censor in my life
[53:16.900 --> 53:21.900]  That's called a king that's called a lord and we set this country up to get away from that
[53:21.900 --> 53:27.900]  Absolutely and that's what makes your case the fight of the century at least in terms of the first amendment
[53:27.900 --> 53:36.900]  And by the way you're not just saying that that's what the law journals are saying that's what I mean and the justices say that let's go to clip to court defense protected speech here it is
[53:36.900 --> 53:48.900]  This we were in looking for this data for a long time and so this is a change he failed to comply he came to the 18th hearing now that was after the broadcast
[53:48.900 --> 53:52.900]  And he didn't bring the Google Analytics that he had for TV
[53:52.900 --> 53:59.900]  So the judge was absolute she would have been first of all we're talking about an abusive discretion we all recognize that
[53:59.900 --> 54:05.900]  And I think the I think we go back to where we started with Justice McDonald
[54:05.900 --> 54:13.900]  Identify I mean implicitly identifying the trial court is in the best position to know whether the compliance has been met they know the ins and outs
[54:13.900 --> 54:23.900]  They know whether they know the degree to which compliance is either just barely substantial or really substantial and they and we defer to them
[54:23.900 --> 54:31.900]  But if we were to find that Mr. Jones statements were protected speech could we even get there
[54:31.900 --> 54:44.900]  I want to be clear for Mr. Koskoff here again I showed Google Analytics how many times Sandy Hook was on the website was like zero point something to that I can
[54:44.900 --> 54:55.900]  Well in the term they were asking for the Google Analytics that's like saying I want the Internet you just go into this interface and we don't even know how it works you've been here and tried to figure it out
[54:55.900 --> 55:05.900]  It's just a it's a whole bunch and most of you got to pay for and so we saw what they did with our emails they got 60 something thousand emails not 50,000
[55:05.900 --> 55:13.900]  Then they data mined and scanned it and found hidden code of child porn someone had sent us right after they filed suit on us
[55:13.900 --> 55:20.900]  And then that was about the press that we sent child porn to the families when they subpoenaed emails we never opened
[55:20.900 --> 55:28.900]  We gave them to them they scanned them found it and then told the press we sent child porn in an attempt to damage us I mean it's just incredible norm
[55:28.900 --> 55:40.900]  Well it is and what's more one of the under reported parts of the argument is we claim that there were due process violations that in the hearing on the 18th when you were sanctioned you were not given notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard
[55:40.900 --> 55:55.900]  There are two very very important factual inaccuracies in what Mr. Koskow said to the Supreme Court the night before the the 17th at 756 we tried to email them a great deal of Google Analytics material that your office worked with me to identify
[55:55.900 --> 56:06.900]  I don't have any indication that they ever opened that email what's more an associate of my office appeared in court in the morning of the 18th and tried to hand them a thumb drive and they said no we don't want it
[56:06.900 --> 56:22.900]  So for you know these are facts that would be developed in an evidentiary hearing but you know the judge in our view shot first and didn't even ask questions later she refused to ask questions and she refused to ask questions because she was animated in substantial part by the
[56:22.900 --> 56:32.900]  speech that you engage and you were telling me you've never seen a judge I mean they're asking for everything so they can hand it over the Democratic Party basically in my view here is the judge the Supreme Court
[56:32.900 --> 56:44.900]  If they wanted to find out hey what part of this decision is based on the discovery issues and what part is based on the First Amendment there was literally there's nothing preventing them from doing that
[56:44.900 --> 57:04.900]  And that is a mixed motive situation though and I think you know that's an important point I mean if the claim if an employer for example you know says you're fired because you're incompetent and you're fired because of your gender the court won't say well those are independent at all in fact to the contrary
[57:04.900 --> 57:19.900]  You can't have and here what's a little different is this isn't a court just issuing an order the claim is that the court itself as the Chief Justice pointed out was the equivalent of the employer it was the unconstitutional actor
[57:19.900 --> 57:41.900]  It was doing something that was unconstitutional if the defendants are right that is it was violating First Amendment rights and so when there are two reasons in a mixed motive analysis I think under a month healthy in those cases if the unconstitutional motive is in there then you lose
[57:41.900 --> 57:50.900]  We'll be right back with more on the other side that will cover geopolitical developments
[58:11.900 --> 58:30.900]  The ideal altitude for the perfect cup a robust coffee with great flavor and mild acidity there has never been a more important time to support info wars so if you love coffee and if you want to fight for freedom then you can help

[58:47.900 --> 59:03.900]  Do you feel that my style is wrong or my substance is wrong trying to fact check the president the deceptive Humpty Dumpty troll known as Brian Stelter his little weasel minion Oliver Darcy have made it their life's mission to take patriots off the air and
[59:03.900 --> 59:15.900]  censor us and of course he famously settled on many others that Trump is the info wars president president Trump's furious reaction to Facebook's action showcases that he is I'm sorry to say that info wars president
[59:15.900 --> 59:28.900]  And you know what is true our audience of activists our guests our crew and my drive in your drive has brought Trump the White House and other nationalists to power around the world and now Trump's openly coming out declaring war on these
[59:28.900 --> 59:42.900]  globalist tyrants and their unelected anti human tyrannies so this is a day of great victory and I salute you all but now in the thick of the fight so info wars store.com for products you need massive sales now so we can continue on to the future and give these
[59:42.900 --> 59:47.900]  bastards one hell of a fight right until the end until we've defeated them
[1:00:12.900 --> 1:00:32.900]  I feel like I'm back in the trial court listening to a parade of pourables over the ordinary over and over and over again you get a snapshot of what the trial court proceedings were like Alex Jones is notoriously bad he needs to be silenced
[1:00:32.900 --> 1:00:51.900]  you know there was no threat here Chris Maddy's no wallflower he's a former United States attorney who tangled with a governor would you describe it as defamatory he didn't know he raised as he put it himself I learned of this on a particular day low and behold just days after I had been
[1:00:51.900 --> 1:01:07.900]  notified by this young man and this is a firm whenever they file a pleadings there on CNN the next morning with their allegations reported as fact they picked this fight let's be real about that in 2012 Sandy hook occurred let me finish justice Palmer they waited until 2018
[1:01:07.900 --> 1:01:23.900]  to file the suit why and and then they hire they file a highly creative piece of litigation that seeks to transform cut into a restriction on speech this is no claim about a defective product this is an attempt to silence the man
[1:01:23.900 --> 1:01:39.900]  let's be clear they say in these lawsuits in Texas and Connecticut that my empire as they call it is made off Sandy hook that is a hoax that is a lie their empires they run for office they live off this they sue
[1:01:39.900 --> 1:01:57.900]  Remington they sue the school they sue the hero teacher that's what they do they they eat drink and sleep Sandy hook and then they come here and then say I'm Mr Sandy hook make me deal with it and then say give us the documents your
[1:01:57.900 --> 1:02:12.900]  parents I really appreciate you was a lot of other clubs I know that you like the job that Robert Barnes did last on the war room covering at that's posted a band video he did do a great job but just closing comments about where you see all this going
[1:02:12.900 --> 1:02:16.340]  you see all this going because a lot of people have been celebrating. He's already on appeal
[1:02:16.340 --> 1:02:20.420]  to the Supreme Court. That means he'll be shut down. No, no, no. No, no, no, no. To everybody
[1:02:20.420 --> 1:02:25.940]  out there drooling, hoping we could shut down. This is before we ever even have a trial or even
[1:02:25.940 --> 1:02:31.460]  this is years away. This is the court coming in and getting involved because it looks like a
[1:02:31.460 --> 1:02:35.060]  train wreck to them. It looks like something shouldn't be happening. This is a good thing that
[1:02:35.060 --> 1:02:39.860]  they took this up to the Supreme Court and very rare, correct Norm? Correct. We asked for this
[1:02:39.860 --> 1:02:43.780]  appeal because we thought your rights had been violated. The court said, wow, we need to hear
[1:02:43.780 --> 1:02:48.020]  about this and they listened to our arguments. This is about the bottom of the first or second
[1:02:48.020 --> 1:02:52.260]  inning. There's a long way to go. The litigation isn't going to end as a result of this trip to
[1:02:52.260 --> 1:02:56.900]  the Supreme Court. I predict we'll have one or two more before it's done. We're in it to win it,
[1:02:56.900 --> 1:03:02.820]  and no matter how long it takes. I know you're personally shocked. A lot of other lawyers I
[1:03:02.820 --> 1:03:07.460]  talked to, like I've got good family friends that are lawyers, prominent ones. Some of them are
[1:03:07.460 --> 1:03:11.300]  Democrats and they can't believe there's this big an attack on the First Amendment. They read
[1:03:11.300 --> 1:03:15.860]  these suits and just said, I've never seen anything like it. I don't understand that that's why I
[1:03:15.860 --> 1:03:19.700]  worry so much about a hate speech restriction. You know, you've been de-platformed and you've
[1:03:19.700 --> 1:03:25.060]  been made into a scapegoat. And so they're trying out arguments on somebody they regard as quote,
[1:03:25.060 --> 1:03:30.180]  unquote, extreme on the theory that they can be sold. If those arguments are sold in your case,
[1:03:30.180 --> 1:03:36.580]  they'll be applied to others on an incremental basis until in the end, we've got a 51st star on
[1:03:36.580 --> 1:03:41.860]  the flag. And that's for the Republic of P.C., which is what they want to do. I do not want to
[1:03:41.860 --> 1:03:54.180]  live in that Republic. And what's more, I will not. Norm, now you've got all of these Democrat
[1:03:54.180 --> 1:03:59.940]  publications getting sued and losing too. And I mean, this just seems like a suicidal war
[1:03:59.940 --> 1:04:05.220]  on all sides, like a circular firing squad. Well, I think that we've got a problem in the country.
[1:04:05.220 --> 1:04:09.940]  I think pluralism is run riot. We don't have common conceptions. You know, Cicero once said a
[1:04:09.940 --> 1:04:13.940]  republic was not just any collection of human beings, but people bound together with common
[1:04:13.940 --> 1:04:18.100]  interests and common conceptions of right. We're afraid to talk about good and evil. As you point
[1:04:18.100 --> 1:04:23.540]  out, we're afraid to talk about God. We glorify every identity and we celebrate, we celebrate
[1:04:23.540 --> 1:04:28.180]  differences, though difference for an end in itself. The end to that is the bottom pulling
[1:04:28.180 --> 1:04:34.420]  out of pluralism and social chaos. And so right now, we don't have people actually arguing about
[1:04:34.420 --> 1:04:39.620]  what a good life is. What are the attributes of a good human being? Because to talk about the
[1:04:39.620 --> 1:04:43.540]  attributes of a good life or a good human being might offend somebody who's not living that.
[1:04:43.540 --> 1:04:48.980]  Well, if we have lost the courage, not just of our convictions, but to have convictions,
[1:04:48.980 --> 1:04:51.380]  then we're serious. That's right. It's really the end of what
[1:04:51.380 --> 1:04:55.460]  confound of this country is the death of America. Thank you, Norm. Thank you, Alex.
[1:04:56.180 --> 1:05:01.540]  The final days of September are turning out to be incredible. Trump's speech to the UN was
[1:05:01.540 --> 1:05:06.100]  like oxygen to a man who's been held under water for a big old glass of ice water in the Sahara
[1:05:06.100 --> 1:05:10.580]  Desert. It was amazing. And it shows that we've done our job. You've done your job to get the
[1:05:10.580 --> 1:05:14.900]  word out about who the real enemies of human freedom are. The globalist. Globalism is not our
[1:05:14.900 --> 1:05:18.740]  future and we're going to defeat it together. But now the battle has quickened. They're trying to
[1:05:18.740 --> 1:05:23.300]  bankrupt us and shut us down. We've got the best products out there that you absolutely need.
[1:05:23.300 --> 1:05:27.300]  And we're selling the huge discounts. We got to sell a lot to fund ourselves. So we've got Black

[1:05:44.020 --> 1:05:51.540]  week at Infowarsstore.com. Thank you for your support. The future does not belong to globalists.
[1:05:51.540 --> 1:05:57.540]  The future belongs to patriots.
[1:06:07.220 --> 1:06:15.540]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[1:06:15.540 --> 1:06:23.140]  At the bottom of the hour, we're going to get into
[1:06:24.260 --> 1:06:30.420]  new developments in the third attempted deep state coup against President Trump.
[1:06:31.860 --> 1:06:41.060]  And the developments are stunning. I mean, there's no way to hype this up as big as it is and as
[1:06:41.060 --> 1:06:47.060]  dangerous as it is. And if you study history, the people living in the really big historical
[1:06:47.060 --> 1:06:57.140]  events normally don't realize they're in it until it's almost over or over. And I am a lay historian.
[1:06:57.140 --> 1:07:02.180]  I mean, I'm really into history and the way people operate the things that have happened.
[1:07:02.180 --> 1:07:07.300]  Because I found out as a very young person who like comic books and science fiction,
[1:07:07.300 --> 1:07:14.740]  it was a voracious reader. I mean, I was a Chad, I was a jock, but I also hung out with the heavy
[1:07:14.740 --> 1:07:22.580]  metal kids and the Goths and also hung out with the black kids. And I also like to stay up late
[1:07:22.580 --> 1:07:29.300]  at night, you know, reading a good history book. And so I was well rounded. And I just by the time
[1:07:29.300 --> 1:07:34.100]  I was about 11, I didn't read comic books or science fiction anymore. My mom would be like,
[1:07:34.100 --> 1:07:37.780]  hey, you want to go to the mall and get some more comic books. She knew I like to collect them.
[1:07:37.780 --> 1:07:42.660]  And I said, no, mom, I'd like to go to the bookstore, though. And I bought mine comp when I
[1:07:42.660 --> 1:07:46.900]  was about 11. And the woman thought I was a Nazi at the counter. She got really upset.
[1:07:46.900 --> 1:07:52.580]  So I had blonde hair, blue eyes. And she said, are you a Nazi? And I said, are you a Nazi selling
[1:07:52.580 --> 1:07:58.260]  this book? She thought that was real witty. But it was a big orange version of mine comp with Hitler
[1:07:58.260 --> 1:08:03.540]  on the front. And I thought, no, this guy is supposedly the most evil man in history. I want
[1:08:03.540 --> 1:08:17.540]  to read what he wrote. Read Nietzsche, you know, read Plato. And I didn't get all of it till later.
[1:08:17.540 --> 1:08:24.340]  But I'm not bragging about that. I just get around most of these PhD historians or these leftist
[1:08:24.340 --> 1:08:31.300]  professor types. And they act like they're academic to impress people. But they really
[1:08:31.300 --> 1:08:37.780]  don't have even a wide range of knowledge and not even really a specific deep knowledge, generally,
[1:08:38.500 --> 1:08:44.500]  of what they're even involved in. They're very lazy. And if you watch a CFR meeting,
[1:08:44.500 --> 1:08:49.220]  they'll go on for three hours on C-SPAN. In the past, I would watch them when I had time.
[1:08:49.780 --> 1:09:00.180]  And it is the most arrogant, foppish, empty, sycophantic pretend world where these men
[1:09:00.180 --> 1:09:05.780]  and predominantly all sit around in their suits and kiss each other's butts and talk about how
[1:09:05.780 --> 1:09:10.100]  smart they are and then all scratch each other's back and give each other government contracts.
[1:09:12.340 --> 1:09:14.740]  And we've all been around groups of men like that, haven't we?
[1:09:16.180 --> 1:09:18.900]  Where people sit around a table and talk about how great they are.
[1:09:18.900 --> 1:09:27.540]  And I just really don't like those people. What about you? And then you find out
[1:09:30.100 --> 1:09:35.700]  that a good percentage of them are pedophiles. Some of them like to have sex with little girls,
[1:09:35.700 --> 1:09:40.020]  some of them like to have sex with little boys. And then you find out, oh, you're not a man of
[1:09:40.020 --> 1:09:43.220]  culture, you see, because you don't want to have sex with little boys and little girls.
[1:09:43.220 --> 1:09:50.020]  And then you find out they're even into more degenerate stuff. Because that's kind of like
[1:09:50.020 --> 1:09:56.340]  the entry drug, the gateway. The real heavy hitter, start wars, kill millions of people,
[1:09:57.060 --> 1:10:05.060]  put cancer viruses in vaccines, ship out factor 8 million, 500,000 people full HIV and hepatitis
[1:10:05.060 --> 1:10:09.540]  and cellam, that's a bear. You know, the Clintons for decades, shipping out blood, they knew had
[1:10:09.540 --> 1:10:18.740]  HIV in every pint. I mean, really, they're just big galactic size a-holes who do evil
[1:10:18.740 --> 1:10:25.060]  stuff and believe it makes them more powerful. And I use this analogy because it's only people
[1:10:25.060 --> 1:10:31.140]  ever get it. Everybody's probably seen episode four. I guess that's Star Wars. Episode three,
[1:10:31.140 --> 1:10:40.980]  Revenge of the Sith, where Darth Vader's just killed the head of the Jedi or helped Palpatine
[1:10:40.980 --> 1:10:49.780]  do it. Palpatine tells him, you must go to the Jedi Temple, kill all the younglings, only then
[1:10:49.780 --> 1:10:57.620]  we'll be more powerful on the dark side to defeat Obi-Wan Kenobi. And that's really Satanism right
[1:10:57.620 --> 1:11:04.900]  there. Because that is exactly what they do. If you're not strong enough to kill your Labrador
[1:11:04.900 --> 1:11:14.900]  retriever and slit its throat, then you're not strong enough to kill kids. You're not strong.
[1:11:15.860 --> 1:11:22.340]  And that's why militaries throughout the world, not just the Nazis, others do it. You take care
[1:11:22.340 --> 1:11:31.780]  of a dog for a year or so and then you kill it. You strangle it. Now that's Satanism, ladies and
[1:11:31.780 --> 1:11:42.180]  gentlemen. And it's a test to see if you'll go to the dark side. And it's wrong. And they're not
[1:11:42.180 --> 1:11:45.860]  really looking for that because it's strength. They're looking for that because they can corrupt you.
[1:11:45.860 --> 1:11:52.820]  You know, if I really need to kill my dog to save my kids, I'll do it just like that. I
[1:11:52.820 --> 1:11:58.020]  don't need to kill it to prove I can do it. For some evil son of a, you know what,
[1:11:59.300 --> 1:12:05.860]  so they can see it, they can get me to do bad things. I can do whatever I have to to take
[1:12:05.860 --> 1:12:12.020]  down evil people and I'll do it. But it doesn't mean that I then get into things like that to
[1:12:12.020 --> 1:12:21.540]  prove I can do it. And these people get a thrill out of it and they enjoy it. And they're building
[1:12:21.540 --> 1:12:28.340]  a grid of total control to make us comply. You think social media and the social score
[1:12:29.220 --> 1:12:36.420]  is only going to make you attack Alex Jones to get promoted or be vapid and be empty. So you get
[1:12:36.420 --> 1:12:44.340]  37 million followers on Instagram, but none of it matters. It's all empty. They want you pliable
[1:12:44.340 --> 1:12:48.900]  for the world they're building and the world they're building is very ugly. And once you bow,
[1:12:48.900 --> 1:12:55.380]  in one way, you're going to bow a thousand ways until you don't know who you are. When we come
[1:12:55.380 --> 1:13:00.900]  back, there's a story on dredgerport.com that everybody should go read at dredgerport.com.
[1:13:00.900 --> 1:13:07.220]  China unveiled super surveillance camera that can link to its social credit system. And this ties
[1:13:07.220 --> 1:13:13.780]  into what's being built here, what Amazon just rolled out two days ago, and the admissions
[1:13:14.420 --> 1:13:18.900]  that, oh, by the way, they're not just doing wireless communication with data packages.
[1:13:19.460 --> 1:13:26.900]  They're subaudible and also with dog whistle above what humans can hear communicating with each
[1:13:26.900 --> 1:13:32.980]  other and devices without asking you. And they're hidden microphones in everything. So even when
[1:13:32.980 --> 1:13:42.980]  you default turn them off, they've got microphones now that are smaller than a thin piece of hair.
[1:13:44.180 --> 1:13:48.580]  I always thought my hair was thin, blondes have thin hair. Now that I got a lot of gray hair,
[1:13:48.580 --> 1:13:57.300]  it's even thinner. It's thinner than a gray hair, and it can give you good audio. And that's 2019.
[1:13:57.300 --> 1:14:01.860]  It's exponentially getting better. Soon, there's going to be microphones, in fact, the word is
[1:14:01.860 --> 1:14:09.460]  they already have them, that are so small, the naked, I can't see them and are smaller than a grain
[1:14:09.460 --> 1:14:16.820]  of sand. See how that works? We're going to go to break, come back and break it all down.
[1:14:16.820 --> 1:14:22.340]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you want to really support the info war and give the globalists a

[1:14:26.820 --> 1:14:32.820]  you really need these products. David Knight has been having trouble sleeping. And I told him,
[1:14:32.820 --> 1:14:37.380]  hey, take a week off. He had a heart attack. Oh, you know, it was serious heart attack earlier
[1:14:37.380 --> 1:14:42.340]  this year, but try to come back like a week. I made him come back in two months. I said, man,
[1:14:42.340 --> 1:14:49.140]  take knockout and take fish oil. He said, I've taken knockout, then it's hard to get back up.
[1:14:49.140 --> 1:14:54.180]  I said, you got to do it. And I said, take the krill oil and some fish oil together. Take three
[1:14:54.180 --> 1:14:58.420]  of them when you go to bed. He did that last weekend and this week, he came to me yesterday
[1:14:58.420 --> 1:15:02.420]  looking 10 years younger. I'm not kidding. He said, it's incredible. I never did the fish
[1:15:02.420 --> 1:15:07.060]  oil with the knockout. And now I'm just going to bed earlier. And I do have trouble getting up,
[1:15:07.060 --> 1:15:12.740]  but yeah, I feel so good. And I said, man, I know. And by the way, nobody ever told me
[1:15:13.460 --> 1:15:18.340]  to do the fish oil to sleep. Except my ex-wife, she always would like to eat fish at night.
[1:15:18.340 --> 1:15:22.340]  She said, oh, I sleep so much better and have great dreams. It's true. The oils are psychoactive.
[1:15:23.460 --> 1:15:26.900]  And this doesn't have any of the mercury that fish can have. It's all been, these are high
[1:15:26.900 --> 1:15:30.580]  end ones, it's all been removed. And it's caused a lot more for us to produce these. But
[1:15:32.100 --> 1:15:35.460]  we've got the ultimate fish oil, the ultimate krill oil, and we've got honor roll for kids.
[1:15:35.460 --> 1:15:41.220]  They can take the adult one too. Just trust me. Just take three of them with knockout. And
[1:15:42.740 --> 1:15:45.940]  it's, it's, it's amazing. That's all 50% off right now.

[1:16:36.820 --> 1:16:44.020]  World Wars one and two left England broken. Its former colony, the U.S. had to save the empire.
[1:16:44.020 --> 1:16:49.540]  Was there ever a vote? Who do we fight for? The deep state began with World War one.

[1:19:54.100 --> 1:20:04.980]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:24.740 --> 1:20:34.980]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:46.420 --> 1:20:51.540]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. I am Alex Jones, your host. We are here live Monday through
[1:20:51.540 --> 1:20:58.980]  Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central Standard Time and then, of course, there is the War Room
[1:20:58.980 --> 1:21:05.460]  3 to 6 p.m. and then from 7 to 9, there is the War Room with Will Johnson and Tom Papert.
[1:21:05.460 --> 1:21:10.660]  That's really a great show because Will Johnson gets out in front, he walks around with his mic,
[1:21:10.660 --> 1:21:17.300]  he has a lot of guests on. Papert really knows the issues and does a lot of research along with
[1:21:17.300 --> 1:21:22.020]  Johnson. It's really great. We're going to have an hour show that's going to be a boil-down countdown
[1:21:22.020 --> 1:21:25.940]  show that's going to be mainly for TV. Radio stations are great to get it if they want.
[1:21:25.940 --> 1:21:29.460]  It's going to be launching soon, 6 to 7 in between there. We're going to have some more
[1:21:29.460 --> 1:21:35.060]  things by the end of the year, as promised. We've been trying to expand into 2020 to really give
[1:21:35.060 --> 1:21:41.940]  the globalists a run for their money and I should also say this, again, we were number one in news
[1:21:41.940 --> 1:21:47.380]  on Roku when we got banned. They used the Sandy Hook families to say that I was currently
[1:21:47.380 --> 1:21:51.460]  coming after them and coming to their homes, which I never did, and they used Democrats to
[1:21:51.460 --> 1:21:55.460]  say that I was threatening to kill the children. The owner of Roku wasn't going to take me off
[1:21:55.460 --> 1:21:59.380]  till he heard that and they did and there's obviously going to have to be some legal action over
[1:21:59.380 --> 1:22:09.140]  that. There's no end to these people and expanding on that, that's the same thing that's being done
[1:22:09.140 --> 1:22:15.780]  to Trump. I mean, none of this is true. None of this is real and it's just extremely dangerous
[1:22:15.780 --> 1:22:19.700]  what's happening. We're going to be breaking it all down next segment, the latest developments,
[1:22:19.700 --> 1:22:27.700]  but before I get to the control grid, before I break down this whole panopticon that's going
[1:22:27.700 --> 1:22:33.940]  into place and how we can hopefully stop it, I want to go back to a film I made that was released
[1:22:33.940 --> 1:22:43.700]  a long, long time ago. This film is now almost 13 years old. It's in-game blueprint for global
[1:22:43.700 --> 1:22:49.780]  enslavement. The film is two and a half hours long. The extras are an hour long. The DVD is
[1:22:49.780 --> 1:22:55.060]  still available at m4store.com to have it in your library. A lot of you do, but it's free on YouTube.
[1:22:55.060 --> 1:22:59.380]  One of the things they haven't taken down, I did, was in-game. When it was on Google
[1:22:59.380 --> 1:23:03.940]  Video, I was very proud of it. It had over 50 million views, but they got rid of Google Video the
[1:23:03.940 --> 1:23:09.300]  next year, so it only has like six million views on YouTube, but still proud of in-game
[1:23:10.020 --> 1:23:17.940]  because it really reads like a futurist report that then came true. So here's a little bit
[1:23:17.940 --> 1:23:25.700]  from in-game blueprint for global enslavement. In the near future, Earth is dominated by a
[1:23:25.700 --> 1:23:31.780]  powerful world government. Once free, nations are slaves to the will of a tiny elite.
[1:23:32.980 --> 1:23:40.980]  The dawn of a new dark age is upon mankind. Countries are a thing of the past. Every form
[1:23:40.980 --> 1:23:47.300]  of independence is under attack, with the family and even the individual itself nearing extinction.
[1:23:47.300 --> 1:23:55.940]  Close to 80% of the Earth's population has been eliminated. The remnants of a once free
[1:23:55.940 --> 1:24:01.060]  humanity are forced to live within highly controlled, compact, prison-like cities.
[1:24:02.740 --> 1:24:09.140]  Travel is highly restricted. Super highways connect the megacities and keep the population
[1:24:09.140 --> 1:24:16.900]  from entering into unauthorized zones. No human activity is private. AI supercomputers
[1:24:16.900 --> 1:24:23.620]  chronicle and categorize every action. A prison planet dominated by a ruthless gang of control
[1:24:23.620 --> 1:24:29.940]  freaks whose power can never be challenged. This is the vision of the global elite, their goal.
[1:24:31.540 --> 1:24:35.780]  A program of total dehumanization where the science of tyranny is lost.
[1:24:35.780 --> 1:24:42.740]  A worldwide control grid designed to ensure the overlord's monopoly of power forever.
[1:24:43.620 --> 1:24:48.260]  Our species will be condemned to this nightmare future unless the masses are awakened
[1:24:48.260 --> 1:24:52.260]  to the New World Order master plan and mobilized to defeat it.
[1:24:54.580 --> 1:25:00.900]  Erected by a secretive group, the Georgia Guidestones are a testament to the elite's plan
[1:25:00.900 --> 1:25:06.580]  for a world religion, global laws, with a global court and army to enforce it.
[1:25:08.980 --> 1:25:14.100]  And set in stone, it is written that the population never rise above 500 million.
[1:25:19.460 --> 1:25:27.380]  As zones, no human activity is private. AI supercomputers chronicle and categorize every
[1:25:27.380 --> 1:25:32.820]  action. A prison planet dominated by a ruthless gang of control freaks.
[1:25:35.140 --> 1:25:39.460]  And again, that's just a few clips sandwiched together haphazardly from the film
[1:25:39.460 --> 1:25:43.700]  that get into what's currently happening because this has been an admitted program.
[1:25:43.700 --> 1:25:50.500]  This story is up on DrudgeReport.com and I suggest that people get it there on the right hand side.
[1:25:50.500 --> 1:25:57.620]  China unveils super surveillance camera that can link to its social credit system.
[1:25:58.260 --> 1:26:04.260]  A new camera with a resolution five times more detailed than the human eye able to monitor
[1:26:04.260 --> 1:26:09.460]  thousands of people in real time and identify individual faces has been unveiled by Chinese
[1:26:09.460 --> 1:26:14.180]  scientists prompting renewed fears about mass surveillance. Renewed fears, it's here.
[1:26:14.180 --> 1:26:22.580]  ABC News in Australia reports that they knew 500 megapixel cloud camera AI system dubbed
[1:26:22.580 --> 1:26:29.060]  super camera was revealed at China's International Industry Fair last week and that feeds in the
[1:26:29.060 --> 1:26:35.940]  optics to their system. And they admit if already tens of millions of people are denied flights,
[1:26:35.940 --> 1:26:40.980]  they're denied able to buy cars or food or groceries because they violated something
[1:26:40.980 --> 1:26:46.100]  the party said. And then once you submit to that level, they begin tightening the news.
[1:26:46.100 --> 1:26:49.140]  And then once you submit to that and they're already proposing it to you in under the level
[1:26:49.140 --> 1:26:54.980]  social score, get sterilized. Well, you'll get decades of free credits. That's how you'll get your
[1:26:56.260 --> 1:27:03.860]  free income, your universal income, or you've had all your vaccines or oh, you
[1:27:04.820 --> 1:27:10.340]  made your son transgender. That's the highest bonus is chopping your son's genitals and testicles off.
[1:27:10.340 --> 1:27:13.300]  That's a big bonus when you do. I mean, I'm not kidding. That's the sacrament.
[1:27:14.660 --> 1:27:18.100]  That's the plan in human as we know it. And here's other articles. Oh,
[1:27:18.100 --> 1:27:25.220]  oh, Amazon unveils new method to auto delete Alexa recordings. First, they denied they were
[1:27:25.220 --> 1:27:29.540]  recording you. First, they denied that people were listening. All these devices are designed to do
[1:27:29.540 --> 1:27:35.060]  this. And now, oh, it's got a system where you can go in and tell it to auto delete funny.
[1:27:35.060 --> 1:27:40.660]  Google Nest says that to turned out there's a hidden microphone and it's never off. And it's
[1:27:40.660 --> 1:27:45.380]  communicating not just with other Google devices, but with everything because industry built. This
[1:27:45.380 --> 1:27:52.660]  is the smart revolution. You can't even find non smart stuff, non spy stuff, non anti technocracy
[1:27:52.660 --> 1:27:59.220]  stuff. Be a big business in the future for analog and systems that don't spy on you. And all this
[1:27:59.220 --> 1:28:03.460]  modern junk doesn't work. It's always breaking it screwed up. You always got to buy an update.
[1:28:03.460 --> 1:28:14.580]  It's all planned with obsolescence so that it breaks on purpose, planned obsolescence,
[1:28:15.460 --> 1:28:20.660]  all a scam, all a screw job. You know, they got light bulbs that cost maybe 10 cents, 20 cents
[1:28:20.660 --> 1:28:26.820]  more that last five years instead of six months. Well, it's beyond planned obsolescence. It's planned
[1:28:26.820 --> 1:28:32.980]  breakdown of society. It's planned annihilation. It's planned hell. And Amazon smart glasses,
[1:28:32.980 --> 1:28:38.740]  smart privacy nightmare as people fear an Orwellian world is on the horizon on the horizon. No,
[1:28:38.740 --> 1:28:44.580]  they're announcing it to you now. They rolled out more than a dozen new devices that spy on you
[1:28:44.580 --> 1:28:48.980]  all the time and are built into everything you do. And pretty soon there won't be any devices that

It's going to run as long as supplies last across the board, at least 50% off, store-wide, free shipping, double patriot points and more. We've not done this, ladies and gentlemen, since last Christmas. But I want you to take advantage of this. We need funds to run our operations so it is a win-win. We're going into 2020.
[1:31:46.180 --> 1:31:56.180]  InfoWars needs the funds. Plus, these are great products. Go take advantage of them right now at infowarsstore.com or infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[1:31:56.180 --> 1:32:14.180]  I want to thank the listeners of this broadcast. I want to thank our affiliates. I want to thank our sponsors. I want to thank the InfoWars crew and I want to thank God in Heaven, the ruler of our universe for the fact that Donald Trump is delivering on so much he's promised to do.
[1:32:14.180 --> 1:32:32.180]  The speech at the UN is as important as Eisenhower's military-industrial complex, beware of their tyranny speech. We talked about technological elite. He came out and he exposed how big tech is a new ruling class that is manipulating the minds of the people and engaging in massive oppression.
[1:32:32.180 --> 1:32:48.180]  And he talked about how globalism is not the future of the world. And Trump has done a great job exposing the UN, the globalists and the chai comms in their house that the Rockefellers set up in New York, the UN. This was incredible.
[1:32:48.180 --> 1:32:58.180]  The future does not belong to globalists. The future belongs to patriots.
[1:32:58.180 --> 1:33:06.180]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:06.180 --> 1:33:34.180]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[1:33:34.180 --> 1:33:52.180]  All right, we've got very successful national constitutional lawyer, criminal lawyer, First Amendment lawyer Robert Barnes, the InfoWars chief counsel who filed suit on Mother Jones's operative on the young turds and one other individual this week.
[1:33:52.180 --> 1:34:08.180]  And he's here with us working and co-hosting with me. We're going to get at the start of the next hour into the huge impeachment developments and the fact that the Democrats say they do intend to impeach Trump, begin the impeachment, bring forth the articles for a vote by Thanksgiving.
[1:34:08.180 --> 1:34:22.180]  And in the current statements, we're going to look at Trump saying, shift's got to step down, putting out that hoax announcement that he didn't say till later was a hoax transcript of President Trump talking to the Ukrainian in the quid pro quo.
[1:34:22.180 --> 1:34:40.180]  And then other fake dossiers, other fake transcripts were put out by the Morning Psycho. Joe, we'll talk about that next hour and we will open the phones up specifically on this constitutional crisis and the fact that I think they're very serious and are moving forward with it.
[1:34:40.180 --> 1:34:54.180]  People are saying, well, it's backfiring and it's making Trump more popular. They know he's popular in real polls. They know he's going to win. This is desperation. This is a Hail Mary, just like a Lazy Ford and the Kavanaugh garbage.
[1:34:54.180 --> 1:35:02.180]  It doesn't mean they'll be successful, but they are rabid. We'll talk about it next hour and take your phones with Robert Barnes because he's dead on on this.
[1:35:02.180 --> 1:35:12.180]  But I wanted to talk about some things. We talked about it dinner the other night when you and my wife and some friends were out that great little Italian place. I guess it was a Wednesday night.
[1:35:12.180 --> 1:35:24.180]  You were talking about living in LA a while and you knew some of the same people. I knew you've been to some of the same houses. We won't say any names and just the spirit of it and what it's like.
[1:35:24.180 --> 1:35:38.180]  And if you use that as a microcosm or a cross-section of what's happening with these globalists that are in love with Hollywood and Hollywood's really an expression of their worldview, then you understand where they're coming from and why they want some poverty and degradation,
[1:35:38.180 --> 1:35:46.180]  why they want to be on a castle hill with needles and feces all around them below and everyone else living in squalor. It's really a spiritual issue.
[1:35:46.180 --> 1:35:56.180]  And like a ten minute rant, a great part about dinner with you is you talked me out of the table, which is great, but you really laid out the spirit of the only place I get really depressed is LA.
[1:35:56.180 --> 1:36:08.180]  I feel my soul being sucked. A little bit of that around certain people in groups in DC, you feel it, but it's really the feeling of having your soul sucked and then there's people that enjoy that.
[1:36:08.180 --> 1:36:22.180]  And until we come to grips with this true evil, we won't know why they have a hunger to corrupt children. We'll never know why they create a climate where we have record suicide and why they push all these psychotrophics on people and why.
[1:36:22.180 --> 1:36:31.180]  The psychological system is run by such wicked folks. So Robert Barnes, you're an old school hand of the world. You're not just a great lawyer. You're a smart cookie, as they say.
[1:36:31.180 --> 1:36:42.180]  Looking at LA and not just LA in general, but Hollywood Hills as an epicenter. Is there anywhere else you feel that dark force and you really laid it out the other night?
[1:36:42.180 --> 1:36:50.180]  Well, sort of LA as a whole is a great description of New York City was that it's a bunch of little neighborhoods connected to one another.
[1:36:50.180 --> 1:37:01.180]  Well, LA is a bunch of neighborhoods disconnected from one another and some of those neighborhoods are black holes of darkness and malevolence and maliciousness and power driven behavior.
[1:37:01.180 --> 1:37:08.180]  And really what unites Washington DC culture and Hollywood culture is an obsession with power.
[1:37:08.180 --> 1:37:18.180]  So the I mean, for example, the reason why pedophilia tends to be predominant in occupations and industries where people have power over children is because the pedophile seek that out.
[1:37:18.180 --> 1:37:25.180]  There's nothing inherent in being a clown or a priest or anything else or school teacher or PE teacher that makes somebody bad.
[1:37:25.180 --> 1:37:30.180]  What it is is people that are bad seek out those positions of power over children will have physical access to them.
[1:37:30.180 --> 1:37:39.180]  They're power driven, corrupted cultures, cultures so driven by like the love of money is evil as it is read in the Bible because it's a power driven motive.
[1:37:39.180 --> 1:37:46.180]  Not money that's evil or resources is when you worship it and you'll do anything to have it.
[1:37:46.180 --> 1:37:51.180]  And the only reason you love it or worship it is for the status, the prestige and the power it provides.
[1:37:51.180 --> 1:37:54.180]  Money is just a means of power. That's all it is.
[1:37:54.180 --> 1:37:58.180]  So the Bible was really saying was that love of power is the root of all evil.
[1:37:58.180 --> 1:38:04.180]  And that's why places and cultures and communities that love evil, that love the love of power are the root of evil.
[1:38:04.180 --> 1:38:11.180]  That's where you find disproportionate degrees of pedophilia, child pornography, child abuse and corrupted cultures.
[1:38:11.180 --> 1:38:18.180]  Me too is more dominant in the media culture of New York, the political culture of DC and the entertainment culture of Hollywood.
[1:38:18.180 --> 1:38:21.180]  And why are they now externalizing the hierarchy?
[1:38:21.180 --> 1:38:26.180]  I mean, they're really coming out now and saying, yeah, we're pedophiles, we're going to have sex with your kids.
[1:38:26.180 --> 1:38:29.180]  Yeah, we're devil worshipers. Yeah, we're poisoning you. Yeah, we're going to kill you with 5G.
[1:38:29.180 --> 1:38:37.180]  Well, you have this. I mean, to a certain degree, there's a part of them that feels ashamed of their behavior and then there's a part of them that wants their behavior welcomed.
[1:38:37.180 --> 1:38:41.180]  It's like those people that were doing sort of a sex dance in front of a bunch of kids this weekend.
[1:38:41.180 --> 1:38:45.180]  So that became a popular or shameful video.
[1:38:45.180 --> 1:38:53.180]  You have people who at some level want their culture to be accepted and embraced and their perversions and distortions of morality to be embraced.
[1:38:53.180 --> 1:38:59.180]  And subconsciously, though, there's still some human programming in them. Part of their body wants to kill them and wants them to be caught.
[1:38:59.180 --> 1:39:02.180]  Exactly. And feels ashamed by it. Like serial killers.
[1:39:02.180 --> 1:39:08.180]  Almost every serial killer at some portion of them wants to be caught. That's why they rat themselves out to the police.
[1:39:08.180 --> 1:39:10.180]  That's why they rat themselves out to other people.
[1:39:10.180 --> 1:39:11.180]  Oh, they send letters.
[1:39:11.180 --> 1:39:14.180]  Exactly. They send letters to the press and notices and the rest.
[1:39:14.180 --> 1:39:21.180]  Part of it's a power game, but part of it's a need for punishment because there is some component of their human psyche that has it.
[1:39:21.180 --> 1:39:24.180]  But Hollywood's just rampant. I mean, Hollywood's a power-driven culture.
[1:39:24.180 --> 1:39:29.180]  That's why they seek out children because children is the ultimate form of abuse of power.
[1:39:29.180 --> 1:39:32.180]  And so that, like the whole, I quit representing...
[1:39:32.180 --> 1:39:33.180]  It's the ultimate selfishness.
[1:39:33.180 --> 1:39:39.180]  Absolutely. I quit representing anyone who had a house. If a client had a house in the Hollywood Hills, they were no longer a client.
[1:39:39.180 --> 1:39:43.180]  Because every client I had had a house in the Hollywood Hills was a client I didn't want moving forward.
[1:39:43.180 --> 1:39:50.180]  And without saying, without anything about clients, tell people, like, part of their sacrament is a Joker demon clown pain.
[1:39:50.180 --> 1:39:55.180]  I was invited to a wide range of parties up in LA, including in Hollywood Hills.
[1:39:55.180 --> 1:39:58.180]  And no Hollywood Hill party was normal. I mean, I went to two of them and that was it.
[1:39:58.180 --> 1:40:05.180]  You walk in and there's usually that sort of, from the movie Black Dahlia, you have some crazy clown poster that's right as you go in.
[1:40:05.180 --> 1:40:11.180]  It has this dark, comedic, just vicious sort of undercurrent, like the movie It.
[1:40:11.180 --> 1:40:16.180]  That's their logo is a child molesting clown.
[1:40:16.180 --> 1:40:20.180]  Exactly. It's just a commonplace. It's shockingly commonplace.
[1:40:20.180 --> 1:40:23.180]  You find it in places you would never expect to find it.
[1:40:23.180 --> 1:40:28.180]  And so the whole culture of it is just a disturbing culture and unsettling culture.
[1:40:28.180 --> 1:40:36.180]  And what is the root of it is a power driven culture, people who seek power at all costs, seek power at all expense.
[1:40:36.180 --> 1:40:41.180]  See, I've never sought power until I realize I've got to get it to protect myself and others.
[1:40:41.180 --> 1:40:49.180]  And then it makes me nervous when I have power and I want to do a better job and it actually makes me feel humble.
[1:40:49.180 --> 1:40:54.180]  But then you realize these people, they're just crazed and they love it.
[1:40:54.180 --> 1:41:01.180]  And it's like they always are, they're happy on the surface, but they're really unhappy and they're always seeking more power.
[1:41:01.180 --> 1:41:07.180]  No doubt about it. And what you find is that the people who should most seek power are the people who don't.
[1:41:07.180 --> 1:41:10.180]  The people who should most not seek power are those who do.
[1:41:10.180 --> 1:41:18.180]  And it's this power driven culture is what leads to this abuse of individuals, abuse of rights, abuse of liberties and endangers everybody.
[1:41:18.180 --> 1:41:22.180]  Like you look at the gun control debate, that debate isn't about whether or not guns should exist.
[1:41:22.180 --> 1:41:26.180]  That debate is about who should have the power of access to guns.
[1:41:26.180 --> 1:41:29.180]  Should you be able to have the power of it as an individual for your self-defense?
[1:41:29.180 --> 1:41:31.180]  Or should only the state have it?
[1:41:31.180 --> 1:41:32.180]  So the state have a monopoly on it.
[1:41:32.180 --> 1:41:35.180]  And that goes like, oh, you're so good, citizens are turning them in.
[1:41:35.180 --> 1:41:38.180]  Like, we're the bad people, only the state should have it.
[1:41:38.180 --> 1:41:42.180]  Well, then Mexico, again, has a crime rate almost 10 times ours.
[1:41:42.180 --> 1:41:45.180]  One of the worst in the world where only the state has guns.
[1:41:45.180 --> 1:41:48.180]  Well, deep irony today is that he was up at Kent State.
[1:41:48.180 --> 1:41:52.180]  Beato was up at Kent State saying, hey, oh, it's so terrible that some people brought some guns here.
[1:41:52.180 --> 1:41:55.180]  There were private citizens when the terrible event happened at Kent State.
[1:41:55.180 --> 1:41:56.180]  It wasn't the army.
[1:41:56.180 --> 1:41:58.180]  It wasn't private citizens shooting down protesters.
[1:41:58.180 --> 1:41:59.180]  The National Guard.
[1:41:59.180 --> 1:42:00.180]  Exactly.
[1:42:00.180 --> 1:42:01.180]  So the-
[1:42:01.180 --> 1:42:05.180]  Which is the whole reason if the government ever got out of control, we have the guns is exactly for that.
[1:42:05.180 --> 1:42:08.180]  Read the Declaration of Independence, Dumbo.
[1:42:08.180 --> 1:42:09.180]  Precisely.
[1:42:09.180 --> 1:42:10.180]  That's what it's all about.
[1:42:10.180 --> 1:42:11.180]  It's about self-defense.
[1:42:11.180 --> 1:42:12.180]  Self-defense.
[1:42:12.180 --> 1:42:13.180]  It's about a balance of power.
[1:42:13.180 --> 1:42:14.180]  Exactly.
[1:42:14.180 --> 1:42:19.180]  Because the constitutional founders recognized, and the people who put the Bill of Rights into power,
[1:42:19.180 --> 1:42:24.180]  which was the ordinary American people who required it as a precondition of the Constitution going into force in the first place,
[1:42:24.180 --> 1:42:28.180]  and the first Congress had to pass the Bill of Rights to honor that commitment,
[1:42:28.180 --> 1:42:33.180]  was because the balance of power, because they recognized that the people who needed power,
[1:42:33.180 --> 1:42:36.180]  who would best respect power, who would best safeguard power-
[1:42:36.180 --> 1:42:37.180]  It's about decentralizing power.
[1:42:37.180 --> 1:42:38.180]  Exactly.
[1:42:38.180 --> 1:42:41.180]  When we come back, let's play Trump, a clip I never got to, at the UN saying that.
[1:42:41.180 --> 1:42:42.180]  Exactly.
[1:42:42.180 --> 1:42:46.180]  And talk more about this, because Democrats like Swallowswell and Beto keep saying,
[1:42:46.180 --> 1:42:48.180]  oh yeah, citizens, you'll never fight the government.
[1:42:48.180 --> 1:42:49.180]  We'll defeat you guys.
[1:42:49.180 --> 1:42:51.180]  Oh yeah, like the Vietnamese rice farmers.
[1:42:51.180 --> 1:43:20.180]  We'll be back on Alex Jones.
[1:43:21.180 --> 1:43:50.180]  We'll be back on Alex Jones.
[1:43:51.180 --> 1:44:19.180]  We'll be back on Alex Jones.

[1:47:13.180 --> 1:47:41.180]  We'll be back on Alex Jones.
[1:47:41.180 --> 1:48:10.180]  We'll be back on Alex Jones.
[1:48:11.180 --> 1:48:38.180]  We'll be back on Alex Jones.
[1:48:38.180 --> 1:49:05.180]  We'll be back on Alex Jones.
[1:49:05.180 --> 1:49:34.180]  We'll be back on Alex Jones.
[1:49:35.180 --> 1:50:04.180]  We'll be back on Alex Jones.
[1:50:05.180 --> 1:50:32.180]  We'll be back on Alex Jones.
[1:50:32.180 --> 1:50:59.180]  We'll be back on Alex Jones.
[1:50:59.180 --> 1:51:28.180]  We'll be back on Alex Jones.
[1:51:29.180 --> 1:51:58.180]  We'll be back on Alex Jones.

[1:52:26.180 --> 1:52:53.180]  We'll be back on Alex Jones.
[1:52:53.180 --> 1:53:22.180]  We'll be back on Alex Jones.
[1:53:23.180 --> 1:53:52.180]  We'll be back on Alex Jones.
[1:53:53.180 --> 1:54:20.180]  We'll be back on Alex Jones.
[1:54:20.180 --> 1:54:49.180]  We'll be back on Alex Jones.
[1:54:50.180 --> 1:55:19.180]  We'll be back on Alex Jones.
[1:55:20.180 --> 1:55:49.180]  We'll be back on Alex Jones.
[1:55:50.180 --> 1:56:19.180]  We'll be back on Alex Jones.
[1:56:20.180 --> 1:56:47.180]  We'll be back on Alex Jones.
[1:56:47.180 --> 1:57:14.180]  We'll be back on Alex Jones.
[1:57:14.180 --> 1:57:43.180]  We'll be back on Alex Jones.

[2:00:06.180 --> 2:00:16.180]  There is no circumstance under which the United States will allow international entries to trample on the rights of our citizens,
[2:00:16.180 --> 2:00:21.180]  including the right to self-defense.
[2:00:21.180 --> 2:00:27.180]  That is why this year I announced that we will never ratify the UN Arms Trade Treaty,
[2:00:27.180 --> 2:00:32.180]  which would threaten the liberties of law-abiding American citizens.
[2:00:32.180 --> 2:00:38.180]  The United States will always uphold our constitutional right to keep and bear arms.
[2:00:38.180 --> 2:00:42.180]  We will always uphold our Second Amendment.
[2:00:42.180 --> 2:00:50.180]  The core rights and values America defends today were inscribed in America's founding documents.
[2:00:50.180 --> 2:01:01.180]  Our nation's founders understood that there will always be those who believe they are entitled to wield power and control over others.
[2:01:01.180 --> 2:01:10.180]  Tyranny advances under many names and many theories, but it always comes down to the desire for domination.
[2:01:10.180 --> 2:01:17.180]  It protects not the interests of many, but the privilege of few.
[2:01:17.180 --> 2:01:24.180]  Our founders gave us a system designed to restrain this dangerous impulse.
[2:01:24.180 --> 2:01:35.180]  They chose to entrust American power to those most invested in the fate of our nation, a proud and fiercely independent people.
[2:01:35.180 --> 2:01:46.180]  The true good of the nation can only be pursued by those who love it, by citizens who are rooted in its history,
[2:01:46.180 --> 2:01:54.180]  who are nourished by its culture, committed to its values, attached to its people,
[2:01:54.180 --> 2:02:01.180]  and who know that its future is theirs to build or theirs to lose.
[2:02:01.180 --> 2:02:08.180]  Patriots see a nation and its destiny in ways no one else can.
[2:02:08.180 --> 2:02:11.180]  Liberty is only preserved.
[2:02:11.180 --> 2:02:15.180]  Sovereignty is only secured.
[2:02:15.180 --> 2:02:17.180]  Democracy is only sustained.
[2:02:17.180 --> 2:02:22.180]  Greatness is only realized by the will and devotion of patriots.
[2:02:22.180 --> 2:02:29.180]  He just said that political power goes out of the barrel of a gun, and so our people have the guns, unlike China.
[2:02:29.180 --> 2:02:35.180]  He literally talked about the spirit of 1776 there, and the true definition, it's not about duck hunting.
[2:02:35.180 --> 2:02:41.180]  I mean, Trump is really, really starting to find his second wind here.
[2:02:41.180 --> 2:02:49.180]  Yeah, the answer to China's orwellian 1984 vision for the world is still America's spirit of 1776.
[2:02:49.180 --> 2:02:55.180]  And that's what the President made clear, and he made clear and articulated in detail and was willing to do it from the floor of the United Nations no less,
[2:02:55.180 --> 2:03:02.180]  by saying that he would never broach any international intrusion, any international interference with the right of self-defense,
[2:03:02.180 --> 2:03:04.180]  which is the right way to call the Second Amendment.
[2:03:04.180 --> 2:03:09.180]  The language is the right to bear arms because it needed to be literal for legal purposes,
[2:03:09.180 --> 2:03:13.180]  but what the principle it is protecting is the right of self-defense.
[2:03:13.180 --> 2:03:15.180]  The right of self-defense against other criminals.
[2:03:15.180 --> 2:03:20.180]  The right of self-defense against the state when the state acts inappropriately or improperly.
[2:03:20.180 --> 2:03:22.180]  The speech really was a third of force.
[2:03:22.180 --> 2:03:26.180]  I'm tempted to come in Sunday and go on a few hours early.
[2:03:26.180 --> 2:03:31.180]  I might do it Saturday, but regardless, just to play the whole speech and then calmly go through it,
[2:03:31.180 --> 2:03:34.180]  because I watched it again two nights ago.
[2:03:34.180 --> 2:03:35.180]  It's 43 minutes long.
[2:03:35.180 --> 2:03:39.180]  It's just pure America.
[2:03:39.180 --> 2:03:42.180]  Most presidents hide from this.
[2:03:42.180 --> 2:03:45.180]  Trump is just flaunting it.
[2:03:45.180 --> 2:03:49.180]  I have a sneaking suspicion that Stephen Miller wrote the speech.
[2:03:49.180 --> 2:03:51.180]  I know Trump adds to the speeches.
[2:03:51.180 --> 2:03:53.180]  That's Stephen Miller's language to it, too.
[2:03:53.180 --> 2:03:54.180]  I know Stephen Miller.
[2:03:54.180 --> 2:03:58.180]  So all that is Miller's language, Miller's template, Miller's text.
[2:03:58.180 --> 2:03:59.180]  Everything about it is Miller.
[2:03:59.180 --> 2:04:01.180]  It's a little bit of Trump editing.
[2:04:01.180 --> 2:04:04.180]  Patriots, as a word, Trump really likes.
[2:04:04.180 --> 2:04:07.180]  So there are certain words that are Trump's terminology.
[2:04:07.180 --> 2:04:08.180]  I thank God for Stephen Miller.
[2:04:08.180 --> 2:04:12.180]  That's just an example of how we need people to just go to college that are patriots,
[2:04:12.180 --> 2:04:13.180]  get involved in government.
[2:04:13.180 --> 2:04:15.180]  And then he's very unassuming.
[2:04:15.180 --> 2:04:16.180]  He knows to keep his head down.
[2:04:16.180 --> 2:04:20.180]  And then he's literally like, I hate to even talk about how important he is.
[2:04:20.180 --> 2:04:22.180]  They've already tried to dox him repeatedly.
[2:04:22.180 --> 2:04:24.180]  Whenever they've tried to track where he lives,
[2:04:24.180 --> 2:04:26.180]  tried to release it to the public,
[2:04:26.180 --> 2:04:28.180]  tried to get Antifa involved.
[2:04:28.180 --> 2:04:31.180]  Antifa tried to dox it, put it as graffiti on bus stops.
[2:04:31.180 --> 2:04:33.180]  They want to kill him flexibly.
[2:04:33.180 --> 2:04:34.180]  Yep, just like they're doing this.
[2:04:34.180 --> 2:04:35.180]  Flexibly.
[2:04:35.180 --> 2:04:37.180]  It's like they've done to Senator Paul,
[2:04:37.180 --> 2:04:39.180]  six ribs broken, punctured long.
[2:04:39.180 --> 2:04:41.180]  The left fall celebrates it.
[2:04:41.180 --> 2:04:43.180]  You know, I'm not somebody that hungers after physical war,
[2:04:43.180 --> 2:04:46.180]  but if you little jackass has put you too much longer,
[2:04:46.180 --> 2:04:47.180]  this fight starts.
[2:04:47.180 --> 2:04:48.180]  You're going to be begging for mommy.
[2:04:48.180 --> 2:04:49.180]  We'll be right back.
[2:04:54.180 --> 2:04:57.180]  Do you feel that my style is wrong or my substance is wrong,
[2:04:57.180 --> 2:04:58.180]  trying to fact check the present?
[2:04:58.180 --> 2:05:03.180]  The deceptive, humpy, dumpy troll known as Brian Stelter,
[2:05:03.180 --> 2:05:06.180]  his little weasel minion, Oliver Darcy,
[2:05:06.180 --> 2:05:10.180]  have made it their life's mission to take patriots off the air and to censor us.
[2:05:10.180 --> 2:05:12.180]  And of course, he famously settled on many others
[2:05:12.180 --> 2:05:14.180]  that Trump is the Info Wars president.
[2:05:14.180 --> 2:05:17.180]  President Trump's furious reaction to Facebook's action
[2:05:17.180 --> 2:05:22.180]  showcases that he is, I'm sorry to say, the Info Wars president.
[2:05:22.180 --> 2:05:23.180]  And you know what is true?
[2:05:23.180 --> 2:05:26.180]  Our audience of activists, our guests, our crew,
[2:05:26.180 --> 2:05:30.180]  and my drive and your drive has brought Trump to the White House
[2:05:30.180 --> 2:05:32.180]  and other nationalists to power around the world,
[2:05:32.180 --> 2:05:36.180]  and now Trump's openly coming out declaring war on these globalist tyrants
[2:05:36.180 --> 2:05:38.180]  and their unelected anti-human tyrannies.
[2:05:38.180 --> 2:05:40.180]  So this is a day of great victory,
[2:05:40.180 --> 2:05:42.180]  and I salute you all but now in the thick of the fight.
[2:05:42.180 --> 2:05:45.180]  So, infowarstore.com for products you need,
[2:05:45.180 --> 2:05:48.180]  massive sales now so we can continue on to the future
[2:05:48.180 --> 2:05:51.180]  and give these bastards one hell of a fight right until the end,
[2:05:51.180 --> 2:05:56.180]  until we've defeated them.
[2:06:22.180 --> 2:06:26.180]  Start your engines on this Friday edition.
[2:06:26.180 --> 2:06:28.180]  We're now into the third hour,
[2:06:28.180 --> 2:06:32.180]  and I'm going to open the phones up starting at the next segment.
[2:06:32.180 --> 2:06:37.180]  Your questions, your comments, your statements on the move to impeach Trump.
[2:06:37.180 --> 2:06:40.180]  Pelosi has said she's got six committees
[2:06:40.180 --> 2:06:43.180]  and that they are going to go ahead with articles of impeachment.
[2:06:43.180 --> 2:06:46.180]  We're going to show you the article and statement by Thanksgiving.
[2:06:46.180 --> 2:06:49.180]  We could have President Trump out of office by Christmas.
[2:06:49.180 --> 2:06:52.180]  That's their little present to stealing the election.
[2:06:52.180 --> 2:06:56.180]  But under the Constitution, he could still win the election
[2:06:56.180 --> 2:06:58.180]  and be back in the impeach again.
[2:06:58.180 --> 2:07:01.180]  They'll undoubtedly try to assassinate him at that point.
[2:07:01.180 --> 2:07:03.180]  This country is in the middle of a civil war,
[2:07:03.180 --> 2:07:05.180]  the powerful globalist forces,
[2:07:05.180 --> 2:07:07.180]  but I want to remind listeners of something.
[2:07:07.180 --> 2:07:12.180]  As bad as things could get, I've been on there 25 years,
[2:07:12.180 --> 2:07:17.180]  and when I was a little kid, my parents had a friend
[2:07:17.180 --> 2:07:21.180]  who was a big John Berger in Dallas.
[2:07:21.180 --> 2:07:25.180]  They had meetings at our house by White Rock Lake
[2:07:25.180 --> 2:07:27.180]  when I was like three, four, five years old,
[2:07:27.180 --> 2:07:29.180]  because we moved to Rockwell after that,
[2:07:29.180 --> 2:07:31.180]  and they still had some meetings at our house after that.
[2:07:31.180 --> 2:07:33.180]  And they'd be like Dallas cops and FBI agents
[2:07:33.180 --> 2:07:38.180]  and Army colonels coming over and high-level 7th-A Adventists.
[2:07:38.180 --> 2:07:41.180]  And these were top people that had Richard Nixon
[2:07:41.180 --> 2:07:43.180]  calling them up and stuff before that.
[2:07:43.180 --> 2:07:47.180]  And my mom worked for a group and Richard Nixon used to call up
[2:07:47.180 --> 2:07:48.180]  and she'd hand the phone off.
[2:07:48.180 --> 2:07:49.180]  I'm not bragging.
[2:07:49.180 --> 2:07:51.180]  I'm going to say that's the type of folks.
[2:07:51.180 --> 2:07:53.180]  Maybe 5% of the country was like that
[2:07:53.180 --> 2:07:57.180]  when I was five years old, four years old.
[2:07:57.180 --> 2:08:01.180]  Now, Trump is right up there laying it out at the UN
[2:08:01.180 --> 2:08:04.180]  in 43 minutes, 44 minutes, devastating them.
[2:08:04.180 --> 2:08:07.180]  Their world government, their corporate corruption,
[2:08:07.180 --> 2:08:09.180]  big techs wish to rule intellectually
[2:08:09.180 --> 2:08:11.180]  and create a new dark age.
[2:08:11.180 --> 2:08:13.180]  You want to take our guns to make us slaves?
[2:08:13.180 --> 2:08:16.180]  You want to kill the unborn and the already born?
[2:08:16.180 --> 2:08:18.180]  This was a gauntlet down.
[2:08:18.180 --> 2:08:23.180]  And I can tell you right now, ladies and gentlemen,
[2:08:23.180 --> 2:08:28.180]  I can tell you right now that as far as we've come
[2:08:28.180 --> 2:08:29.180]  against this world government model,
[2:08:29.180 --> 2:08:31.180]  this corporate world government model,
[2:08:31.180 --> 2:08:33.180]  that's still powerful, still in control, has all the money,
[2:08:33.180 --> 2:08:35.180]  has China, has Hollywood.
[2:08:35.180 --> 2:08:36.180]  It doesn't matter.
[2:08:36.180 --> 2:08:38.180]  Once people know it's illegitimate that the EU's unelected
[2:08:38.180 --> 2:08:40.180]  and took over the UK without a vote,
[2:08:40.180 --> 2:08:42.180]  it doesn't matter how many years they try to block a vote
[2:08:42.180 --> 2:08:43.180]  to get out.
[2:08:43.180 --> 2:08:45.180]  The UK will get out.
[2:08:45.180 --> 2:08:47.180]  I said that three years ago, four years ago
[2:08:47.180 --> 2:08:48.180]  when they passed Brexit, I said,
[2:08:48.180 --> 2:08:49.180]  watch, it'll take probably a decade.
[2:08:49.180 --> 2:08:52.180]  But it'll make people totally anti-New World Order
[2:08:52.180 --> 2:08:53.180]  once they ignore their vote.
[2:08:53.180 --> 2:08:54.180]  I predicted that.
[2:08:54.180 --> 2:08:56.180]  People go, oh, they keep coming back
[2:08:56.180 --> 2:08:59.180]  and trying to nullify it.
[2:08:59.180 --> 2:09:03.180]  Once you hit a chain reaction at this level,
[2:09:03.180 --> 2:09:05.180]  once people get, you mean there's big corporations
[2:09:05.180 --> 2:09:07.180]  that pay no taxes, they want to set up a world government,
[2:09:07.180 --> 2:09:10.180]  they want to domesticate men and families
[2:09:10.180 --> 2:09:13.180]  so that no one ever resists them.
[2:09:13.180 --> 2:09:15.180]  They believe there's a post-human world coming
[2:09:15.180 --> 2:09:17.180]  with silicon takeover.
[2:09:17.180 --> 2:09:18.180]  What?
[2:09:18.180 --> 2:09:19.180]  They're going to track everything I do,
[2:09:19.180 --> 2:09:21.180]  and if I don't do what they want,
[2:09:21.180 --> 2:09:25.180]  they'll cut me out of jobs or buying groceries or living.
[2:09:25.180 --> 2:09:26.180]  That's not coming.
[2:09:26.180 --> 2:09:28.180]  That's here now.
[2:09:28.180 --> 2:09:30.180]  So it's incredibly negative.
[2:09:30.180 --> 2:09:31.180]  It's frightening.
[2:09:31.180 --> 2:09:32.180]  It's dangerous.
[2:09:32.180 --> 2:09:34.180]  But at least we knew it was coming.
[2:09:34.180 --> 2:09:37.180]  At least we understand what was going to happen.
[2:09:37.180 --> 2:09:40.180]  I mean, I remember being five years old, people going,
[2:09:40.180 --> 2:09:42.180]  they're going to have a big giant computer that tracks
[2:09:42.180 --> 2:09:44.180]  everything you do, and they'll get rid of the cash,
[2:09:44.180 --> 2:09:45.180]  it'll all be digital.
[2:09:45.180 --> 2:09:48.180]  If you don't do what they want, the plan is to shut it off.
[2:09:48.180 --> 2:09:50.180]  I mean, and because these folks were reading
[2:09:50.180 --> 2:09:52.180]  what Zbigniew Brzezinski was writing.
[2:09:52.180 --> 2:09:53.180]  These folks, when I was a kid,
[2:09:53.180 --> 2:09:56.180]  my dad and others weren't just making this up.
[2:09:56.180 --> 2:09:58.180]  And here we are, 40 years later,
[2:09:58.180 --> 2:10:01.180]  we've got a president in that's actually fighting it
[2:10:01.180 --> 2:10:02.180]  to a great extent.
[2:10:02.180 --> 2:10:04.180]  We've got all these other populists being elected.
[2:10:04.180 --> 2:10:09.180]  So I want people to realize that we're not the one behind
[2:10:09.180 --> 2:10:10.180]  the eight ball.
[2:10:10.180 --> 2:10:13.180]  It's this global government system because they may try
[2:10:13.180 --> 2:10:15.180]  to bring in a total tyranny, and they are.
[2:10:15.180 --> 2:10:17.180]  That's not going to make this dog hunt.
[2:10:17.180 --> 2:10:19.180]  Am I wrong, Robert Barnes?
[2:10:19.180 --> 2:10:20.180]  No, that's precisely the case.
[2:10:20.180 --> 2:10:23.180]  And the biggest obstacle to their ability to do what they want
[2:10:23.180 --> 2:10:27.180]  is the support of the ordinary people, of the everyday person.
[2:10:27.180 --> 2:10:30.180]  It's the American people that continue to protect the president,
[2:10:30.180 --> 2:10:32.180]  that continue to protect democracy,
[2:10:32.180 --> 2:10:35.180]  that continue to protect the spirit of 1776
[2:10:35.180 --> 2:10:39.180]  against the sort of Chinese social credit tyrannical model
[2:10:39.180 --> 2:10:41.180]  where you don't have a right to privacy,
[2:10:41.180 --> 2:10:43.180]  where you don't have a right to speech,
[2:10:43.180 --> 2:10:44.180]  where you don't have a right to free press,
[2:10:44.180 --> 2:10:46.180]  where you don't have a right to self-defense,
[2:10:46.180 --> 2:10:49.180]  where you don't have a right to bail in criminal proceedings.
[2:10:49.180 --> 2:10:51.180]  You don't even have a right to a trial in a criminal proceeding,
[2:10:51.180 --> 2:10:54.180]  at least of all a jury trial in a criminal proceeding.
[2:10:54.180 --> 2:10:56.180]  You have none of the spirit of 1776,
[2:10:56.180 --> 2:10:59.180]  none of the 10 amendments that make up the Bill of Rights,
[2:10:59.180 --> 2:11:01.180]  none of the foundational fundamental freedoms
[2:11:01.180 --> 2:11:03.180]  that are the fountain of American liberty
[2:11:03.180 --> 2:11:05.180]  that have been spread around the world,
[2:11:05.180 --> 2:11:08.180]  that now the Chinese model is trying to counteract
[2:11:08.180 --> 2:11:11.180]  in its sort of communist capitalist hybrid system
[2:11:11.180 --> 2:11:15.180]  that's really about big tech, big corporate, big state dominance
[2:11:15.180 --> 2:11:17.180]  against the ordinary individual American
[2:11:17.180 --> 2:11:19.180]  and the ordinary individual person, period.
[2:11:19.180 --> 2:11:21.180]  And what the president was laying down
[2:11:21.180 --> 2:11:23.180]  and the reason why he did it at the United Nations
[2:11:23.180 --> 2:11:26.180]  is because the big models competing for the world power
[2:11:26.180 --> 2:11:29.180]  are the United States 1776 model
[2:11:29.180 --> 2:11:32.180]  and the Chinese 1984 model.
[2:11:32.180 --> 2:11:34.180]  And it's happening in real time, it's happening in live time.
[2:11:34.180 --> 2:11:36.180]  And the president stood up and said,
[2:11:36.180 --> 2:11:40.180]  I'm going to fight for the 1776 model all around the world
[2:11:40.180 --> 2:11:43.180]  and willing to say it right here on the floor of the United Nations.
[2:11:45.180 --> 2:11:47.180]  And I've noticed pushback from the controlled right wing
[2:11:47.180 --> 2:11:50.180]  and left wing on Info Wars and on YouTube.
[2:11:50.180 --> 2:11:53.180]  Oh, Jones is red herring, China's not powerful.
[2:11:53.180 --> 2:11:55.180]  There's nothing going on.
[2:11:55.180 --> 2:11:58.180]  Let's all have a race war. It's black versus white.
[2:11:58.180 --> 2:12:01.180]  China is a globalist colony of slaves.
[2:12:01.180 --> 2:12:05.180]  China is an organized top-down command and control economy.
[2:12:05.180 --> 2:12:08.180]  It's been given all the perks, all the one-sided trade deals,
[2:12:08.180 --> 2:12:12.180]  all the intellectual property, all the ports, Panama Canal,
[2:12:12.180 --> 2:12:15.180]  our Office of Personnel Management hack,
[2:12:15.180 --> 2:12:18.180]  our military secrets, the ICBM secrets,
[2:12:18.180 --> 2:12:21.180]  the particle beam weapons secrets,
[2:12:21.180 --> 2:12:25.180]  all of it should be positioned to bring us down.
[2:12:25.180 --> 2:12:27.180]  And so everyone working against America right now
[2:12:27.180 --> 2:12:29.180]  is literally for that model.
[2:12:29.180 --> 2:12:32.180]  The CFR says there's either the Chinese global model
[2:12:32.180 --> 2:12:37.180]  or the American model, and they want the American model to end.
[2:12:37.180 --> 2:12:40.180]  And so the Secretary General of the UN said,
[2:12:40.180 --> 2:12:42.180]  the day of the speech that Trump gave it,
[2:12:42.180 --> 2:12:45.180]  he said, the world is now divided between America and China.
[2:12:45.180 --> 2:12:50.180]  That's the bipolar world with progressivism with China against America.
[2:12:50.180 --> 2:12:52.180]  They're all against us.
[2:12:52.180 --> 2:12:56.180]  And when you look at the weak-minded little slaves of the left
[2:12:56.180 --> 2:12:58.180]  that say no borders, no wall, no USA at all,
[2:12:58.180 --> 2:13:01.180]  that really hate Trump and hate Info Wars and hate Christians
[2:13:01.180 --> 2:13:05.180]  and hate families, these are the scum of the earth.
[2:13:05.180 --> 2:13:07.180]  Just thank God every day you're not them.
[2:13:07.180 --> 2:13:09.180]  And remember, they'll never rule you.
[2:13:09.180 --> 2:13:12.180]  The average leftist with three degrees that are worthless
[2:13:12.180 --> 2:13:14.180]  was taught they're going to be rulers.
[2:13:14.180 --> 2:13:16.180]  They're just the people to bring the country down.
[2:13:16.180 --> 2:13:18.180]  They'll be the people actually pushed to the side
[2:13:18.180 --> 2:13:20.180]  if the authoritarians ever take over.
[2:13:20.180 --> 2:13:23.180]  You're going to be offered jobs by the authoritarians
[2:13:23.180 --> 2:13:25.180]  and they're going to have to refuse them and fight them
[2:13:25.180 --> 2:13:27.180]  if they win this leg of the fight.
[2:13:27.180 --> 2:13:29.180]  That's why it's so pathetic these little minions out there,
[2:13:29.180 --> 2:13:32.180]  the little anti-fumethed college students believe
[2:13:32.180 --> 2:13:34.180]  they're going to have positions of power.
[2:13:34.180 --> 2:13:37.180]  No, you're the ones that are going to be killed first if you're successful.
[2:13:37.180 --> 2:13:40.180]  I mean, if the climate change people were sincere at all,
[2:13:40.180 --> 2:13:42.180]  their obsession would be China,
[2:13:42.180 --> 2:13:44.180]  which is the fastest growing polluter in the world.
[2:13:44.180 --> 2:13:46.180]  And yet they don't even talk about China.
[2:13:46.180 --> 2:13:48.180]  If the human trafficking part of the left,
[2:13:48.180 --> 2:13:50.180]  who's opposed to human trafficking, was sincere about it,
[2:13:50.180 --> 2:13:52.180]  they would be obsessed with China,
[2:13:52.180 --> 2:13:54.180]  which is one of the leading human traffickers in the world.
[2:13:54.180 --> 2:13:55.180]  Or Mexico.
[2:13:55.180 --> 2:13:56.180]  Or Mexico.
[2:13:56.180 --> 2:13:58.180]  If the people who care about religious dissidents' rights,
[2:13:58.180 --> 2:14:01.180]  particularly they say they care about Islam being wrongfully targeted,
[2:14:01.180 --> 2:14:04.180]  well, they would be obsessed with the way China is treating its dissident Muslims
[2:14:04.180 --> 2:14:07.180]  and locking them up in basically a state controlled facility.
[2:14:07.180 --> 2:14:10.180]  Crop and Pence are defending the Muslims in China.
[2:14:10.180 --> 2:14:11.180]  Exactly.
[2:14:11.180 --> 2:14:12.180]  But the left isn't.
[2:14:12.180 --> 2:14:15.180]  If they cared about religious dissident rights,
[2:14:15.180 --> 2:14:17.180]  they would care about the fact that religious dissidents
[2:14:17.180 --> 2:14:19.180]  of a particular spiritual movement
[2:14:19.180 --> 2:14:21.180]  that helped found the epic times here in the United States
[2:14:21.180 --> 2:14:24.180]  are being targeted for human experimentation in China.
[2:14:24.180 --> 2:14:27.180]  Exactly, organ transfers and the rest,
[2:14:27.180 --> 2:14:29.180]  all of which has been documented repeatedly.
[2:14:29.180 --> 2:14:33.180]  So the left is exposed when they don't talk about China,
[2:14:33.180 --> 2:14:36.180]  that their real objective is undermining the U.S. experiment
[2:14:36.180 --> 2:14:38.180]  and the U.S. democratic system.
[2:14:38.180 --> 2:14:39.180]  Let me correct you.
[2:14:39.180 --> 2:14:41.180]  The Washington Post says,
[2:14:41.180 --> 2:14:45.180]  oh, crush Trump, destroy Trump, oh, zeezy ping,
[2:14:45.180 --> 2:14:48.180]  oh, you're my daddy, save me, oh, help me,
[2:14:48.180 --> 2:14:50.180]  don't defeat the American.
[2:14:50.180 --> 2:14:52.180]  It's the ultimate foreign meddling.
[2:14:52.180 --> 2:14:53.180]  The ultimate foreign meddling.
[2:14:53.180 --> 2:14:55.180]  All this talk about Ukraine and Russia and everyone else.
[2:14:55.180 --> 2:14:57.180]  The ultimate foreign meddling is China.
[2:14:57.180 --> 2:14:58.180]  China's doing this wrong.
[2:14:58.180 --> 2:15:00.180]  Wouldn't you say they're like 90% of all meddling?
[2:15:00.180 --> 2:15:01.180]  Oh, absolutely.
[2:15:01.180 --> 2:15:03.180]  Look at who's buying up banking infrastructure in the Caymans
[2:15:03.180 --> 2:15:07.180]  in the Caribbean with their donations of infrastructure.
[2:15:07.180 --> 2:15:10.180]  Look at who's buying up natural resources in Africa.
[2:15:10.180 --> 2:15:12.180]  Look at who's getting involved in oil politics.
[2:15:12.180 --> 2:15:13.180]  And it's all American money.
[2:15:13.180 --> 2:15:15.180]  America had half the world's wealth,
[2:15:15.180 --> 2:15:18.180]  4% of the population in the 50s and 60s.
[2:15:18.180 --> 2:15:20.180]  The globalists made the decision to break up our families,
[2:15:20.180 --> 2:15:23.180]  emasculate our men, sell off our industry and power
[2:15:23.180 --> 2:15:25.180]  that the West and the Renaissance created.
[2:15:25.180 --> 2:15:29.180]  They gave the Renaissance to the bloodthirsty chai comms.
[2:15:29.180 --> 2:15:32.180]  Well, you just look at it between 2000 and 2020
[2:15:32.180 --> 2:15:34.180]  due to deliberate decisions made by the U.S. government.
[2:15:34.180 --> 2:15:37.180]  U.S. military and manufacturing and industrial power
[2:15:37.180 --> 2:15:39.180]  was stripped in favor of China systematically.
[2:15:39.180 --> 2:15:42.180]  And they all wrote CFR books bragging how they did it.
[2:15:42.180 --> 2:15:44.180]  Well, listen here, you CFRs.
[2:15:44.180 --> 2:15:45.180]  You're gonna get it.
[2:15:45.180 --> 2:15:46.180]  We'll be back.
[2:15:46.180 --> 2:15:47.180]  I'll give the number out.
[2:15:47.180 --> 2:15:48.180]  We'll launch into the impeachment movement.
[2:15:48.180 --> 2:15:49.180]  How to stop it.
[2:15:49.180 --> 2:15:50.180]  Tomorrow's news today.
[2:15:50.180 --> 2:16:19.180]  Stay with us.
[2:16:20.180 --> 2:16:21.180]  We'll be back.
[2:16:50.180 --> 2:16:51.180]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[2:16:51.180 --> 2:16:53.180]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago
[2:16:53.180 --> 2:16:55.180]  when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[2:16:55.180 --> 2:16:56.180]  I sued the IRS in one.
[2:16:56.180 --> 2:16:59.180]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[2:16:59.180 --> 2:17:01.180]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement,
[2:17:01.180 --> 2:17:03.180]  and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems
[2:17:03.180 --> 2:17:05.180]  they thought might never be solved.
[2:17:05.180 --> 2:17:06.180]  I can help you too.
[2:17:06.180 --> 2:17:09.180]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[2:17:09.180 --> 2:17:11.180]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[2:17:11.180 --> 2:17:14.180]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website,
[2:17:14.180 --> 2:17:18.180]  danpilla.com, that's danpilla.com.
[2:17:18.180 --> 2:17:20.180]  Danpilla.com.
[2:17:48.180 --> 2:17:52.180]  Feel the thrill, only at slingbow.com.
[2:18:18.180 --> 2:18:23.180]  It's going to run as long as supplies last across the board,
[2:18:23.180 --> 2:18:27.180]  at least 50% off, store-wide, free shipping,
[2:18:27.180 --> 2:18:30.180]  double-patriot points, and more.
[2:18:30.180 --> 2:18:32.180]  We've not done this, ladies and gentlemen,
[2:18:32.180 --> 2:18:34.180]  since last Christmas.
[2:18:34.180 --> 2:18:36.180]  But I want you to take advantage of this.
[2:18:36.180 --> 2:18:38.180]  We need funds to run our operations,
[2:18:38.180 --> 2:18:40.180]  so it is a win-win.
[2:18:40.180 --> 2:18:41.180]  We're going into 2020.
[2:18:41.180 --> 2:18:42.180]  InfoWars needs the funds.
[2:18:42.180 --> 2:18:44.180]  Plus, these are great products.
[2:18:44.180 --> 2:18:46.180]  Go take advantage of them right now.
[2:18:46.180 --> 2:18:49.180]  At infowarsstore.com or infowarslife.com
[2:18:49.180 --> 2:19:18.180]  or triple-8-253-3139.
[2:19:19.180 --> 2:19:21.180]  We've done massive market barriers,
[2:19:21.180 --> 2:19:24.180]  heavy state subsidies, currency manipulation,
[2:19:24.180 --> 2:19:26.180]  forced technology transfers,
[2:19:26.180 --> 2:19:28.180]  and the theft of intellectual property.
[2:19:28.180 --> 2:19:30.180]  It was simply amazing, and then he talked about
[2:19:30.180 --> 2:19:33.180]  the ruling leftist elite and their censorship
[2:19:33.180 --> 2:19:35.180]  and how it must be met head-on.
[2:19:35.180 --> 2:19:37.180]  My administration has made clear
[2:19:37.180 --> 2:19:40.180]  to social media companies that we will uphold
[2:19:40.180 --> 2:19:42.180]  the right of free speech.
[2:19:42.180 --> 2:19:44.180]  This is amazing.
[2:19:44.180 --> 2:19:47.180]  Find highlights and Trump's entire historic speech
[2:19:47.180 --> 2:19:50.180]  at infowars.com and band.video.
[2:19:50.180 --> 2:19:51.180]  Band.video!
[2:19:51.180 --> 2:19:53.180]  And God bless America.
[2:19:53.180 --> 2:20:22.180]  You're going to miss me.
[2:20:24.180 --> 2:20:27.180]  Nobody here will ever find me.
[2:20:27.180 --> 2:20:29.180]  Money through Friday.
[2:20:29.180 --> 2:20:31.180]  I'm here live.
[2:20:31.180 --> 2:20:33.180]  11 a.m., 3 p.m. Central.
[2:20:33.180 --> 2:20:35.180]  Just like the song.
[2:20:35.180 --> 2:20:37.180]  But there's all those other great shows.
[2:20:37.180 --> 2:20:38.180]  Like David Knight.
[2:20:38.180 --> 2:20:40.180]  I'm going forever now.
[2:20:40.180 --> 2:20:42.180]  Bill Johnson and Tom Papert.
[2:20:42.180 --> 2:20:44.180]  Crank it up for a minute.
[2:20:46.180 --> 2:20:48.180]  A little bit of Christian music here
[2:20:48.180 --> 2:20:50.180]  from the Highwomen for you.
[2:20:50.180 --> 2:20:52.180]  Don't let the darkness take them.
[2:20:52.180 --> 2:20:54.180]  Don't let the darkness take them.
[2:20:54.180 --> 2:20:56.180]  Don't make them feel forsaken.
[2:20:56.180 --> 2:20:59.180]  Just leave them safely to the light.
[2:20:59.180 --> 2:21:01.180]  Look at Hollywood.
[2:21:01.180 --> 2:21:03.180]  Openly want to destroy your children.
[2:21:03.180 --> 2:21:05.180]  Openly saken.
[2:21:05.180 --> 2:21:07.180]  This isn't really a hard choice, is it?
[2:21:07.180 --> 2:21:09.180]  They're trying to demoralize you
[2:21:09.180 --> 2:21:11.180]  and break your will right now.
[2:21:11.180 --> 2:21:13.180]  The truth is they're trying to destroy you.
[2:21:13.180 --> 2:21:15.180]  They're trying to destroy you.
[2:21:15.180 --> 2:21:17.180]  They're trying to destroy you.
[2:21:17.180 --> 2:21:19.180]  They're trying to destroy you.
[2:21:19.180 --> 2:21:21.180]  Don't let them feel right now.
[2:21:21.180 --> 2:21:23.180]  The truth is they're going to lose.
[2:21:23.180 --> 2:21:26.180]  Right as the world government in prophecy is fulfilled.
[2:21:26.180 --> 2:21:29.180]  They are running around trying to kill still and destroy
[2:21:29.180 --> 2:21:31.180]  because they know they're cosmic losers.
[2:21:31.180 --> 2:21:33.180]  We're going to start taking your phone calls next segment.
[2:21:33.180 --> 2:21:35.180]  The toll free number to join us is 877-789.
[2:21:35.180 --> 2:21:36.180]  Alex.
[2:21:36.180 --> 2:21:38.180]  877-789-2539 on this Friday.
[2:21:38.180 --> 2:21:41.180]  In addition, Robert Barnes riding a shotgun with me.
[2:21:41.180 --> 2:21:44.180]  Specifically on how serious you think impeachment is.
[2:21:44.180 --> 2:21:46.180]  What do you think Trump should do?
[2:21:46.180 --> 2:21:48.180]  What should we do?
[2:21:48.180 --> 2:21:54.900]  They're making their move with articles by Thanksgiving and then they could have him
[2:21:54.900 --> 2:21:58.100]  out by the end of the year. People said, well, there's nothing there. They don't care. Now
[2:21:58.100 --> 2:22:01.300]  they're saying he obstructed. Now they're saying he intimidated the witness. They tried to trick
[2:22:01.300 --> 2:22:05.220]  him. As you said last night, you predicted it. And now today they say, oh, he may have leaked
[2:22:05.220 --> 2:22:11.940]  who it was, though he didn't. So they are really, really panicking right now. Trump has no privacy.
[2:22:11.940 --> 2:22:17.380]  He lives in a glass house. He's done nothing wrong. So they put out fake transcripts. MSNBC,
[2:22:17.380 --> 2:22:24.660]  Joe Scarborough, Psycho Joe, the head of the committee, Erwin, your chef, I mean, Adam Schiff,
[2:22:24.660 --> 2:22:30.740]  all these guys, it is completely and totally out of control. What do you think the biggest takeaway
[2:22:30.740 --> 2:22:36.340]  is from this, that it's the deep state? They really mean it this time and that this shouldn't,
[2:22:36.340 --> 2:22:40.180]  their first rodeo, they're really trying to get it done this time out of desperation because
[2:22:40.180 --> 2:22:43.300]  I know Trump's going to win the election. Well, I mean, part of it is the deepest factual truth
[2:22:43.300 --> 2:22:48.980]  about all of this is you can't spell quid pro quo without quid pro Joe that basically Joe Biden was
[2:22:48.980 --> 2:22:53.540]  deeply embedded with the deep state during the Obama administration and was using a Ukrainian
[2:22:53.540 --> 2:22:58.580]  front company to launder cash for the deep state and for his family. And the and in order to cover
[2:22:58.580 --> 2:23:02.980]  that up, they needed to attack the president of both Ukraine and the United States and keep the
[2:23:02.980 --> 2:23:06.500]  world from knowing the truth about what they were. So the big takeaway is this is a desperate
[2:23:06.500 --> 2:23:12.500]  distraction because it goes to Joe Biden. It goes to Mitt Romney. It goes to Obama, Hillary. This is
[2:23:12.500 --> 2:23:16.580]  their cash making operation that trumps over the target. Exactly. And one of the things they've
[2:23:16.580 --> 2:23:21.940]  been paranoid about is that their politics in Ukraine are connected to their politics in Russia
[2:23:21.940 --> 2:23:26.580]  because they've been the various deep state operatives have been in bed with actual Nazi
[2:23:26.580 --> 2:23:31.700]  elements. As you can see in movies like Ukraine on fire and other documentaries who actually
[2:23:31.700 --> 2:23:36.500]  embed long in fact, you can look up various CIA documents right on the CIA FOIL website. You can
[2:23:36.500 --> 2:23:41.300]  find documents that people have used the Freedom of Information Act to get that show the CIA 70
[2:23:41.300 --> 2:23:46.100]  year relationship with the Nazi party in Ukraine, which you did a great job detailing yesterday.
[2:23:46.100 --> 2:23:51.460]  But it's not like the I mean, this is Oliver Stone, totally documents HBO, one of the few
[2:23:51.460 --> 2:23:56.260]  good shows you're still on that isn't a bunch of lies because I before Stone ever even put the
[2:23:56.260 --> 2:24:00.260]  Ukraine on fire. We knew those facts. We've covered it. I mean, he's really reporting
[2:24:00.260 --> 2:24:03.460]  truth there, which is why you don't see it being promoted. So expanding on that.
[2:24:03.460 --> 2:24:10.740]  Warren's now going after Biden to put herself in the pole position. And I think they're willing
[2:24:10.740 --> 2:24:17.460]  to sacrifice Biden to try to get it Trump. But it just shows again, they are absolutely panicked.
[2:24:17.460 --> 2:24:22.980]  Well, and I think for them, the goal is multiple. It isn't just to get president impeached. It's to
[2:24:22.980 --> 2:24:27.940]  shut down his efforts to do a meaningful investigation of deep state corruption as it
[2:24:27.940 --> 2:24:33.780]  extends to Democratic Party elite collusion in foreign countries. And so what does he do?
[2:24:33.780 --> 2:24:38.500]  He's got to not take the bait, not allow them to deter him. He's got the Ukrainian president needs
[2:24:38.500 --> 2:24:42.500]  to move forward. He's come out and say, oh, we figured out what you're scared of. Hillary,
[2:24:42.500 --> 2:24:48.900]  uranium one, Hillary and Soros, he needs to go absolute full war. Yeah, exactly. Tell Attorney
[2:24:48.900 --> 2:24:54.260]  General Barr, there's a mutual legal assistance treaty between the United States and Ukraine
[2:24:54.260 --> 2:25:00.820]  signed and approved by Senator Biden in 1999, put through by President Clinton in 1999. Back
[2:25:00.820 --> 2:25:04.180]  then, they didn't know Ukraine was going to be such a key political place for them to do all this
[2:25:04.180 --> 2:25:09.700]  collusion and corruption. The mutual legal assistance treaty becomes by the US Constitution
[2:25:09.700 --> 2:25:14.260]  superior to congressional legislation. It's a treaty. It's a treaty. It is. So Trump's actually
[2:25:14.260 --> 2:25:18.100]  activating under law, even of what they said is true, though it's not. In fact, he would have
[2:25:18.100 --> 2:25:23.460]  been acting lawlessly had he not agreed to provide support and assistance to investigate
[2:25:23.460 --> 2:25:29.060]  Joe Biden. He that would have been the illegal act. If he would have obstructed justice to protect
[2:25:29.060 --> 2:25:33.620]  Joe Biden, then that would have been a violation of his constitutional obligations under the treaty
[2:25:33.620 --> 2:25:37.620]  provisions of the mutual legal assistance treaty between the United States and Ukraine. There
[2:25:37.620 --> 2:25:42.900]  are so many angles to this. It's just astounding. If I was his legal advisor, I would have told
[2:25:42.900 --> 2:25:47.700]  him to do and say exactly what he didn't said, because that's what was constitutionally obligated
[2:25:47.700 --> 2:25:53.140]  for him to do. His obligation was, Hey, I'm not going to hide running for president in the United
[2:25:53.140 --> 2:25:58.020]  States does not grant you legal immunity from criminal investigation for your bad acts as a
[2:25:58.020 --> 2:26:03.380]  prior official of the United States government. The so the idea that Joe Biden running for office
[2:26:03.380 --> 2:26:07.620]  magically grants him immunity. No, if he got elected, he would have a certain degree of immunity
[2:26:07.620 --> 2:26:11.860]  until he was out of office, but not when he's running for office for his past bad acts in
[2:26:11.860 --> 2:26:17.140]  office. That would be insane. What do you expect him to do next? So I think they're going to double
[2:26:17.140 --> 2:26:21.540]  down, triple down, move forward. They're talking about impeaching the president by Thanksgiving
[2:26:21.540 --> 2:26:26.100]  their Christmas gift to America. The American people is going to be a Senate removal trial of
[2:26:26.100 --> 2:26:29.700]  the president of the United States. That's the deep States idea of running this country. That's
[2:26:29.700 --> 2:26:34.100]  important. Explain how that works. So the first part is the impeachment is like the indictment.
[2:26:34.100 --> 2:26:38.420]  Like you go to the grand jury and indict or if it was a civil suit, it's like the complaint. It's
[2:26:38.420 --> 2:26:43.300]  the beginning of the process, not the conclusion of the process. The impeachment is only one half
[2:26:43.300 --> 2:26:48.500]  of the equation removal, which is the only thing that's consequential. Bill Clinton was impeached,
[2:26:48.500 --> 2:26:53.860]  but he was not removed. So the impeachment is the indictment from the House. That's almost
[2:26:53.860 --> 2:26:58.340]  guaranteed to happen. They're only short, I think, five Democrats currently as of today.
[2:26:58.340 --> 2:27:02.420]  They'll get those five Democrats who will likely lose in 2020 because of their vote,
[2:27:02.420 --> 2:27:06.820]  but they'll do it anyway. But they're going for it. Exactly. They're doubling down, tripling down,
[2:27:06.820 --> 2:27:11.300]  all the way across the board. They're doing anything possible to discourage and deter the
[2:27:11.300 --> 2:27:15.700]  exposure of deep state democratic party elite corruption in their collusion between each
[2:27:15.700 --> 2:27:19.860]  other. And then they're gonna threaten and twist arms on those senators. Exactly. They're already
[2:27:19.860 --> 2:27:24.740]  doing it. They're already leaking things. The intelligence committee is basically co-opted
[2:27:24.740 --> 2:27:29.300]  by the intelligence community. So Trump's real hope and all of our hope is to go on the total
[2:27:29.300 --> 2:27:34.340]  offense. Everybody should take their vacation in D.C. You should go get them by the hand. They're
[2:27:34.340 --> 2:27:39.140]  not gods. They work for you. The place is wide open. Go talk to them. Go to the committees. Go
[2:27:39.140 --> 2:27:43.140]  when they're in the district. The Democrats say, harass people, their houses, break their ribs,
[2:27:43.140 --> 2:27:46.980]  kill them. Don't do that. But you know what? You see them at church. You see them at the
[2:27:46.980 --> 2:27:50.740]  boat dock. You see them at the grocery store. You see them in a restaurant. It's time to let
[2:27:50.740 --> 2:27:54.020]  them know that you're going to hold them responsible for the criminal activity they're
[2:27:54.020 --> 2:27:58.820]  involved in. They want to bully us. BS. You started it. We're going to get in your face.
[2:27:58.820 --> 2:28:06.980]  877-789-2539, 877-789-Alex, specifically questions, comments. You disagree with us. You agree.
[2:28:06.980 --> 2:28:12.980]  877-789-Alex, 877-789-2539. Do you think Trump realizes how much danger he's
[2:28:12.980 --> 2:28:18.340]  in? Yes, he does. I mean, I'm getting text from his campaign people on an hourly basis talking
[2:28:18.340 --> 2:28:22.340]  about how serious and significant this is. And let's be clear. That's a great way to raise money,
[2:28:22.340 --> 2:28:27.460]  but I get his emails too. We're getting 10 times the volume we used to get. It's frantic because
[2:28:27.460 --> 2:28:33.060]  they get it. And he's willing to quintuple and double-triple and quintuple what people give him,
[2:28:33.060 --> 2:28:37.860]  which he hasn't done before. So he recognizes that the American people are his firewall and he's
[2:28:37.860 --> 2:28:43.140]  calling it that. And let's be clear. We're going to see Trump really take the gloves off rhetorically
[2:28:43.140 --> 2:28:47.220]  I predict. He said today this is war. Those are his words. This is war.
[2:28:53.220 --> 2:28:58.900]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners. If you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup
[2:28:58.900 --> 2:29:03.700]  system but were waiting for prices too crazy to pass up, this will be the most important message
[2:29:03.700 --> 2:29:08.260]  you'll ever hear. Bill Hyde here. I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices
[2:29:08.260 --> 2:29:13.220]  on our PPX microgrid system that's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity off
[2:29:13.220 --> 2:29:17.620]  the grid. The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the
[2:29:17.620 --> 2:29:21.780]  east bank of the Mississippi. Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory
[2:29:21.780 --> 2:29:26.260]  to a temporary location. And rather than move it back to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the
[2:29:26.260 --> 2:29:31.300]  system at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory. So
[2:29:31.300 --> 2:29:36.740]  here's what you should do right now. Check out the PPX microgrid system at myownpowergrid.com.

[2:29:56.900 --> 2:30:01.300]  to thank our affiliates. I want to thank our sponsors. I want to thank the M4s crew. And I
[2:30:01.300 --> 2:30:08.740]  want to thank God in heaven, the ruler of our universe, for the fact that Donald Trump is
[2:30:08.740 --> 2:30:15.620]  delivering on so much he's promised to do. The speech at the UN is as important as Eisenhower's
[2:30:15.620 --> 2:30:20.020]  military industrial complex, beware of their tyranny speech. We talked about technological
[2:30:20.020 --> 2:30:26.580]  elite. He came out and he exposed how big tech is a new ruling class that is manipulating the
[2:30:26.580 --> 2:30:32.500]  minds of the people and engaging in massive oppression. And he talked about how globalism
[2:30:32.500 --> 2:30:38.500]  is not the future of the world. And Trump has done a great job exposing the UN,
[2:30:38.500 --> 2:30:43.300]  the globalists, and the chai cons in their house that the Rockefellers set up in New York,
[2:30:43.300 --> 2:30:52.500]  the UN. This was incredible. The future does not belong to globalists. The future belongs to patriots.
[2:30:52.500 --> 2:31:00.180]  The final days of September are turning out to be incredible. Trump's speech at the UN was like
[2:31:00.180 --> 2:31:04.740]  oxygen to a man who's been held under water or a big old glass of ice water in the Sahara Desert.
[2:31:04.740 --> 2:31:09.300]  It was amazing. And it shows that we've done our job. You've done your job to get the word out
[2:31:09.300 --> 2:31:13.700]  about who the real enemies of human freedom are, the globalist. Globalism is not our future. And
[2:31:13.700 --> 2:31:17.460]  we're going to defeat it together. But now the battle has quickened. They're trying to bankrupt
[2:31:17.460 --> 2:31:21.860]  us and shut us down. We've got the best products out there that you absolutely need. And we're
[2:31:21.860 --> 2:31:25.940]  selling them at huge discounts. We've got to sell a lot to fund ourselves. So we've got Black Friday

[2:33:10.980 --> 2:33:23.540]  Watch me. Watch me. I got it. Watch me. I got it. Hey! I got something that makes me want a shelter.
[2:33:24.500 --> 2:33:31.540]  I got something that tells me what it's all about. Oh, yeah. I got something. I got some. And I'm super bad.
[2:33:31.540 --> 2:33:42.660]  Woo! Feels so good. Brown bringing us in. Your phone calls are loaded up. Pastor Sam Berry,
[2:33:42.660 --> 2:33:48.660]  J. John Wildman, Drucker, Vett, Brad, Matt, Jeff, and Martin. We'll get to all of you before
[2:33:48.660 --> 2:33:52.740]  our next baggage takes over. In the first two segments of the next hour, Paul Watson was almost
[2:33:52.740 --> 2:33:56.660]  Stephen Crowder. It was a powerful interview. We got some of the excerpts. So that's the first
[2:33:56.660 --> 2:34:02.340]  15 minutes. But we've got Robert Barns here with us right now. And I just keep watching clips,
[2:34:02.340 --> 2:34:07.220]  even during the breaks, because I see the promos and things we're running, the TV feed, and just
[2:34:07.220 --> 2:34:11.620]  Trump's speech, man. God bless America. God bless the world. Let's have peace. Let's fight
[2:34:11.620 --> 2:34:15.620]  communism and socialism. Let's empower the family. Right to self-defense. China's wrong,
[2:34:15.620 --> 2:34:20.500]  oppressing its people, including its Muslims, and enslaving them, and stealing our stuff, and
[2:34:21.380 --> 2:34:26.180]  big techs out of control, and it's a cult. I mean, it's just hitting on all cylinders. And I think
[2:34:26.180 --> 2:34:31.460]  that is what sent them into, and if he is playing three or 40 chess, if he wanted to fight, he's
[2:34:31.460 --> 2:34:36.660]  got one. I've got the article right here. Again, Trump says, this is war. This is war.
[2:34:37.940 --> 2:34:41.140]  I mean, no doubt about it. I mean, the president recognizes what's taking place,
[2:34:41.140 --> 2:34:47.380]  and the president realizes that this is a battle between the spirit of 1776 and the Chinese 1984
[2:34:47.380 --> 2:34:54.340]  Orwellian model. It's 1776 versus the world. And if that model is going to become the
[2:34:54.340 --> 2:35:01.060]  empowering model it has for the last 300 or so, almost years, the dating back to the founding
[2:35:01.060 --> 2:35:05.780]  of the country, and even before then, when the spirit of 1776 animated the people who came here
[2:35:05.780 --> 2:35:11.140]  in the first place, liberties they would enshrine in the Constitution, but did not begin with the
[2:35:11.140 --> 2:35:16.020]  Constitution. Liberties that, in the words of the founders themselves, began and were founded in
[2:35:16.020 --> 2:35:22.260]  the rights of man, in the contents of the man, in the contents of humankind, as scripted by the
[2:35:22.260 --> 2:35:27.780]  scriptures into the souls of humankind. That's what this is. This is a battle between a sort of AI
[2:35:27.780 --> 2:35:34.580]  future, a big tech future, a big state future, an institutional future, a future where only the
[2:35:34.580 --> 2:35:40.900]  state has a monopoly on guns and weapons and tools of destruction, where the ordinary person has no
[2:35:40.900 --> 2:35:47.060]  means of self-defense against privacy invasions, against their control of their financial well-being,
[2:35:47.060 --> 2:35:52.500]  a social credit system in the Chinese model that now with surveillance technology, with banking
[2:35:52.500 --> 2:35:58.660]  control, with currency control, with gun control, can basically completely monopolize what access
[2:35:58.660 --> 2:36:03.540]  to power and privilege an ordinary person could have. If that model was replicated and duplicated
[2:36:03.540 --> 2:36:07.780]  around the world, American freedom and American liberty would become mutant and dead overnight.
[2:36:07.780 --> 2:36:12.980]  That's why the president chose the floor of the United Nations to make his seminal speech
[2:36:12.980 --> 2:36:19.060]  that will resound in history as a call for all Americans to rally behind the flag, rally behind
[2:36:19.060 --> 2:36:24.180]  liberty, rally behind American freedom against this new threat. And I want to be infinity clear for
[2:36:24.180 --> 2:36:31.140]  everybody. The exact talking points, the exact names, the exact points we have said for 25 years
[2:36:31.140 --> 2:36:36.100]  is what the president's saying. Not because he adopted our nomenclature, this is the real world.
[2:36:36.100 --> 2:36:40.020]  Yeah, the only thing CNN got right is that Trump is the info wars president. That's true because
[2:36:40.020 --> 2:36:43.540]  if you notice Nuna said this is an information war against the president. Exactly, use the exact
[2:36:43.540 --> 2:36:50.020]  phrase theology. Trump declares war on Schiff because Schiff has declared war on reality and
[2:36:50.020 --> 2:36:54.740]  been caught in giant fraud and the media is covering up. So this is the fight, folks,
[2:36:55.460 --> 2:36:59.540]  for America. And we're not just going to replace America with something, you know, that's oh,
[2:36:59.540 --> 2:37:05.300]  not, not good. We're placing with pure nightmare scientific evil. Let's go to phone calls here.
[2:37:05.300 --> 2:37:11.620]  What does Trump need to do? Well, let's talk to trucker vet in FEMA region nine.
[2:37:12.500 --> 2:37:17.780]  Trucker vet. Thanks for holding her on the air. Welcome. Hey, Alex. Thanks for taking my call.
[2:37:19.060 --> 2:37:26.980]  Here's I have a couple things I have. This one thing will be an emergency message to the president.
[2:37:26.980 --> 2:37:34.660]  And it's also a dire prediction. And that is if Trump does not act act as in like a commander
[2:37:34.660 --> 2:37:42.580]  in chief, if he doesn't act, he doesn't take solid offensive hardcore action as if he only has the
[2:37:42.580 --> 2:37:49.540]  remainder of his term to do so. Absolutely. He does not if he does not do that, he will only get
[2:37:49.540 --> 2:37:54.900]  one term or less. That is my emergency message to the president. And then they're going to
[2:37:54.900 --> 2:37:58.820]  destroy him as a message to everyone. And I think Trump knows that that's why we're going to see
[2:37:58.820 --> 2:38:07.460]  some fireworks. Keep going. Yeah, OK. And then the second part of my message is, OK, yes, yes,
[2:38:07.460 --> 2:38:15.460]  we're no more. It's an information war, et cetera. However, instead of instead of engaging these
[2:38:15.460 --> 2:38:22.180]  people, these strong freak minions that want to have control over every aspect of our lives,
[2:38:22.180 --> 2:38:30.580]  it is time for us to transcend them. It is time for us to transcend them. And I got a few ideas
[2:38:30.580 --> 2:38:37.860]  on how to do that. But instead of engaging with them in a battle, we need to transcend them.
[2:38:37.860 --> 2:38:41.540]  That's that's the other part of my message. Look, Matt Rhodes talked about building our own
[2:38:41.540 --> 2:38:45.700]  internet and keeping our own sites. We've got our own audio, our own video, our own news sites.
[2:38:45.700 --> 2:38:50.820]  We're one of the few outfits that actually did it. Everybody else has been taken off the air. And
[2:38:50.820 --> 2:38:55.940]  you know, and I appreciate your call for great points. I've thought about this. We have to engage
[2:38:55.940 --> 2:38:59.940]  them when they make up huge lies, but we know they're liars. And so the only power they have is
[2:38:59.940 --> 2:39:04.580]  bigger and bigger lies to still distract us having to counter them. So how do you balance that?
[2:39:04.580 --> 2:39:10.420]  I mean, I think Trump is calling out Schiff is correct, saying that this is a war is correct.
[2:39:10.420 --> 2:39:14.420]  This that's what this is. This is a deep state combining with efforts he was talking to some
[2:39:14.420 --> 2:39:18.260]  people today that it came out where he talked about how basically the CIA and other operatives
[2:39:18.260 --> 2:39:21.620]  and rogue operatives have been spying on the White House, misusing and abusing. And now
[2:39:21.620 --> 2:39:25.380]  they're calling that intimidation. The president's like, man, these people that worked here spying
[2:39:25.380 --> 2:39:29.140]  on me, making stuff up. They go, oh, you're intimidating us when he fights back in any way.
[2:39:29.140 --> 2:39:33.380]  Oh, that's intimidation, which tells you what they're up to, because they project so much. So
[2:39:33.380 --> 2:39:36.340]  when they when they accuse the president of intimidating, what they mean is that they
[2:39:36.340 --> 2:39:40.580]  plan to engage in intimidation. And it's what they've been doing, intimidate by lies, intimidate
[2:39:40.580 --> 2:39:45.300]  by deception. They want to intimidate everybody around Trump, including Trump himself and the
[2:39:45.300 --> 2:39:49.940]  Ukrainian president, into not investigating their corruption, into not uncovering their criminal
[2:39:49.940 --> 2:39:55.380]  behavior, into not uncovering the scope and scale of bad activities under the Obama administration,
[2:39:55.380 --> 2:40:00.260]  the scandal free administration. They don't want all the scandals that got hidden for eight years
[2:40:00.260 --> 2:40:05.700]  by a compliant Congress and a corrupt media to now be fully viewed by the whole world. Absolutely.
[2:40:06.500 --> 2:40:11.300]  This is it folks. They're coming for Trump. This is bigger than ever. Yep. Let's go ahead and
[2:40:11.300 --> 2:40:17.380]  talk to John and Florida. John, you're on the air. Go ahead. Good afternoon, Alex and
[2:40:17.380 --> 2:40:22.260]  Attorney Barn. How are you today? We're good, sir. Thank you for calling. Great. Attorney
[2:40:22.260 --> 2:40:26.660]  Barns, first, I just want to tell you, you're the greatest shotgun rider and co-pilot I think I've
[2:40:26.660 --> 2:40:33.540]  ever seen. I really enjoy you on the show. Thank you very much. Okay. To you guys really quickly,
[2:40:33.540 --> 2:40:41.220]  here's the hashtag. If they reject, we reelect. Let's start there. And here's here's my question
[2:40:41.220 --> 2:40:45.460]  kind of prefaced with a little bit of a background that fits everything we're talking about.
[2:40:46.660 --> 2:40:53.220]  I'm sure you and your listeners will agree with me that as Trump supporters over the last two or
[2:40:53.220 --> 2:41:01.060]  three years, we're taking a compounding ass kicking and we're being continuously exposed to this
[2:41:01.060 --> 2:41:06.740]  ramped up let's creed. We're being pressurized from so many directions to make us try to,
[2:41:06.740 --> 2:41:12.660]  you know, chase our tails. We're being menaced by people 24 seven who are dedicated to pure evil.
[2:41:13.300 --> 2:41:17.540]  And these people should have been named as enemies of the state a long time ago.
[2:41:18.100 --> 2:41:26.580]  So here's my question. Do you believe that we can no longer afford to cycle analyze everything to
[2:41:26.580 --> 2:41:33.300]  death and wait for permission to fight back on our terms? In other words, is it time to get right
[2:41:33.300 --> 2:41:39.220]  with God and stop singing and start swinging? Well, I know this, they wind up their antifa
[2:41:39.220 --> 2:41:44.100]  folks to go shoot up places and they know what they're doing. This Joker movie is an order to go
[2:41:44.100 --> 2:41:48.260]  out and mass shoot. Even the Pentagon has come out and said that. I mean, this is a weapon system
[2:41:48.260 --> 2:41:52.660]  to trigger incels to go out and kill people. I said that two weeks ago when I saw the transcript
[2:41:52.660 --> 2:41:56.660]  of the film from one of my Hollywood sources and the Pentagon came out yesterday and said that
[2:41:56.660 --> 2:42:02.660]  in an army security services did. This is designed perfectly to get mental patients. I
[2:42:02.660 --> 2:42:05.780]  think they're going to be movie stars. They go out and kill people then blame gun owners. I don't
[2:42:05.780 --> 2:42:12.500]  want any offensive violence. But if everything ever kicks off again, they're going to try to have
[2:42:12.500 --> 2:42:16.100]  street battles and get right wingers to go out and fight antifa the streets. That doesn't need to
[2:42:16.100 --> 2:42:20.820]  happen. These globalists already know they're going to have to hide tail it. And you don't have
[2:42:20.820 --> 2:42:24.740]  to worry about that. They think they're going to hide out in Kauai or wherever their own security
[2:42:24.740 --> 2:42:29.540]  people. If this really goes to a hot war, I can tell you are going to deal with them. And that's
[2:42:29.540 --> 2:42:36.020]  not hype. So I appreciate your call, sir. People start talking about swinging. Hey, how about you
[2:42:36.020 --> 2:42:40.100]  call all the talk radio shows? Tell them about info wars.com. How about you email everybody?
[2:42:40.100 --> 2:42:43.780]  How about you climb on a billboard? You know, I'm not saying do this. That's, you know,
[2:42:43.780 --> 2:42:48.180]  some globalist thing and put a message up there. There's a lot of civil disobedience you can do
[2:42:48.180 --> 2:42:52.420]  before we talk about swinging for the fences and, you know, cracking heads and drawing blood.

[2:47:06.900 --> 2:47:22.820]  Info Wars tomorrow's news today.
[2:47:22.820 --> 2:47:38.100]  Okay let's go right back to your phone calls here and I'm getting the video right now.
[2:47:38.100 --> 2:47:47.380]  It's been posted to infowars.com and newswars.com and it's a textbook example of how the system
[2:47:47.380 --> 2:47:54.660]  spins everything and how they engage in deception. Trump attack on whistleblower in private meeting
[2:47:54.660 --> 2:48:03.220]  was caught on video. He's at a meeting speaking to the United States mission to the United Nations.
[2:48:03.220 --> 2:48:09.620]  He's speaking to a whole bunch of diplomats and he's saying it's all made up. We're at war now
[2:48:09.620 --> 2:48:15.780]  with the deep state. These are sick sick people. They're claiming that's an attack on a whistleblower.
[2:48:15.780 --> 2:48:22.020]  Now I mean that's why they're framing this. That if the president speaks and says he's innocent
[2:48:22.020 --> 2:48:27.540]  that's obstruction. Again there's just no end to this and we'll have this video for you.
[2:48:28.260 --> 2:48:32.660]  We'll air it at six after. I may just share the whole speech. Dr. McGregor understands he gets
[2:48:32.660 --> 2:48:37.940]  preempted sometimes. We'll just share the whole thing probably. But this is just an amazing
[2:48:37.940 --> 2:48:42.740]  time to be alive. Oh absolutely. If John Voight is out there today saying this was war in defense
[2:48:42.740 --> 2:48:46.740]  of the president in a video that's also going viral. So you're seeing across the board and
[2:48:46.740 --> 2:48:52.020]  that's the president having a conversation with his staff and UN staff and he's explaining what's
[2:48:52.020 --> 2:48:58.580]  going on. This person is not a whistleblower. It's a rat spy who makes stuff up. Exactly.
[2:48:59.060 --> 2:49:03.140]  I dealt with this when the media immediately has paid former employees just to make up stuff.
[2:49:03.140 --> 2:49:07.780]  Oh absolutely. This is a situation where this person does not have credibility,
[2:49:07.780 --> 2:49:12.580]  did not have authenticity, did not have admissible evidence and under the law you can only be in a
[2:49:12.580 --> 2:49:18.100]  whistleblower for these purposes if you have firsthand information. Why do they do that?
[2:49:18.100 --> 2:49:23.620]  Because they don't want people spreading rumor and innuendo and in a policy war with the elected
[2:49:23.620 --> 2:49:27.940]  president. This is a classic example of the deep state. There's all kinds of sort of mainstream
[2:49:27.940 --> 2:49:31.940]  press people out there today saying well obviously the deep state does exist doesn't it? Because
[2:49:31.940 --> 2:49:36.580]  that's what this is. There's no other explanation or articulation for what this is except deep
[2:49:36.580 --> 2:49:41.300]  state operatives. These are people who are saying we want to execute our policies against the will
[2:49:41.300 --> 2:49:45.540]  of the elected president of the United States and that includes covering up for prior corruption
[2:49:45.540 --> 2:49:50.100]  involving the Obama administration and deep state collusion in the Ukrainian politics.
[2:49:50.100 --> 2:49:53.380]  It just shows the American people have to say no to this. This is outrageous.
[2:49:54.260 --> 2:49:56.980]  Martin in Ohio. Martin thanks for holding her on the air. Go ahead.
[2:49:59.220 --> 2:50:04.740]  Hi Alex. Can you hear me? I sure can. All right. Yeah. I just wanted to ask you
[2:50:04.740 --> 2:50:12.500]  basically if the deep state does manage to impeach and remove Trump how does that not
[2:50:12.500 --> 2:50:19.060]  completely undermine and destroy our system of government because what they do is by removing
[2:50:19.060 --> 2:50:24.980]  Trump they avoid our elections. They say the elections buying for the people no longer have
[2:50:24.980 --> 2:50:28.900]  any weight and aren't worth anything. Oh yeah. This means that the government will be totally
[2:50:28.900 --> 2:50:32.740]  illegitimate if they're able to do this. I mean this is the corrupt evil anti-American
[2:50:32.740 --> 2:50:37.620]  globalist government that says America was never great. We suck having borders existing as bad.
[2:50:37.620 --> 2:50:42.500]  This is the enemy. Well in fact we'll probably be able to find Joe Biden's statement from 1998.
[2:50:42.500 --> 2:50:45.860]  He said the president does not serve at the privilege of Congress. The president does not
[2:50:45.860 --> 2:50:51.220]  serve at the privilege of Senator Joe Biden. The president serves at the will of the people
[2:50:51.220 --> 2:50:55.540]  and it is the people who elect the president not Congress and that's Joe Biden saying that.
[2:50:55.540 --> 2:50:59.940]  So the the the democratic political establishment used to admit and acknowledge that the people
[2:50:59.940 --> 2:51:04.100]  get to elect the president not the politicians not the deep state and the president gets to
[2:51:04.100 --> 2:51:08.100]  dictate policy not the deep state not the politicians and the congress and the house
[2:51:08.100 --> 2:51:12.660]  when it comes to foreign policy. So this is just a war against the president of the United States.
[2:51:12.660 --> 2:51:16.980]  This is a continuous war that they refuse to step back from or step down from. The president's
[2:51:16.980 --> 2:51:20.900]  going to have to double down and what when he said yeah this is war these are bad people
[2:51:20.900 --> 2:51:24.500]  and if they think I'm going to fold and go home and go gently into the good night they got another
[2:51:24.500 --> 2:51:29.060]  thing. This is just an incredible time to be alive. Anything else Martin? Nope that was it.
[2:51:29.060 --> 2:51:35.460]  I mean I could give you a plug the toothpaste and the toothbrush best combo ever. But yeah you

[2:52:51.700 --> 2:52:57.620]  air thanks for calling. Oh hello good evening Alex good evening to you and your guest host just a
[2:52:57.620 --> 2:53:04.100]  couple of things one I think now is the time for Trump to you know Trump be president and and just
[2:53:04.100 --> 2:53:08.820]  put an end to this I mean I understand he didn't do it before with all the russian staff in case
[2:53:08.820 --> 2:53:14.260]  people thought he was trying to cover up everybody knows he's covering up nothing and now he has to
[2:53:14.260 --> 2:53:18.900]  stop these people I mean they're deranged and apart from that it just makes everyone think
[2:53:18.900 --> 2:53:24.980]  that people in America are crazy I mean you know looking at Nancy Pelosi and and these people are
[2:53:24.980 --> 2:53:30.900]  just and Adam Schiff I don't know how these people are still there you know and they're questioning
[2:53:30.900 --> 2:53:37.300]  people of good stature and and and undermining them it just seems it's like it it just seems
[2:53:37.300 --> 2:53:42.020]  crazy now I mean I can't believe that they're they're even getting away with this somebody needs to
[2:53:42.020 --> 2:53:49.140]  just step in and stop them what comment on that Barnes right you want the sub clip so you want him
[2:53:49.140 --> 2:53:52.900]  the words him saying this is war oh yeah yeah we're gonna get it part of the clip absolutely we're
[2:53:52.900 --> 2:53:57.220]  gonna get that yeah I think that that was the they're confused sure absolutely but no what the
[2:53:57.220 --> 2:54:01.620]  ladies say I'm gonna go work on this you take over okay thanks thank you ma'am can't talk to you
[2:54:01.620 --> 2:54:06.100]  gotta go it's all right we're good keep going we're fine yeah I mean there's no question about it I
[2:54:06.100 --> 2:54:11.460]  mean I think the what's taking place and what's happening in the country do you have any further
[2:54:11.460 --> 2:54:16.660]  comment yeah well I tell you the one thing that I wanted to say and that was the other day I know
[2:54:16.660 --> 2:54:23.060]  it's a slightly different topic when Trump was with the Indian Prime Minister you know at his rally
[2:54:24.020 --> 2:54:29.060]  I got a dreadful feeling at the end you know when he came up to him and and took him around as it
[2:54:29.060 --> 2:54:34.260]  were you know I could see there was a real feeling of happiness and joy there but I wondered whether
[2:54:34.260 --> 2:54:38.580]  or not that wasn't planned and I thought that was a great security risk there I just sort of had a
[2:54:38.580 --> 2:54:45.540]  deja vu of something awful happening and I just think probably it's not advisable is it to be in
[2:54:45.540 --> 2:54:50.500]  that we put in that position again you know I doubt very much if it was planned but do you know
[2:54:50.500 --> 2:54:56.500]  what I mean when he went around the arena yes yes I do I mean and I think it's Trump willing to be
[2:54:56.500 --> 2:55:02.180]  Trump at any cost or at any consequence and I think he's sort of once he got over Robert Mueller and
[2:55:02.180 --> 2:55:06.980]  defeated Mueller's efforts to sort of take him out I think he gave him confidence that he needed
[2:55:06.980 --> 2:55:12.100]  to be himself continue to be himself no matter where it might lead with his opponents and his
[2:55:12.100 --> 2:55:16.340]  critics and I think that's what we're seeing and I think that what we're seeing is the sort of the
[2:55:16.340 --> 2:55:20.980]  deep state doubling down people who are his critics doubling down people who want him out
[2:55:20.980 --> 2:55:26.740]  doubling down rather than stepping back and reassessing the political landscape in light
[2:55:26.740 --> 2:55:33.540]  of the loss of the Robert Mueller effort to take him out well you know God bless him and and all
[2:55:33.540 --> 2:55:38.900]  the people that that follow him because you know they have to be extra brave now I think to you
[2:55:38.900 --> 2:55:45.940]  know just get rid of all of these terrible awful people I mean it's just incredible that it's still
[2:55:45.940 --> 2:55:50.820]  it's still going on and they're not speaking more about all the wonderful things that he's doing
[2:55:50.820 --> 2:55:55.220]  every time he's doing something good they seem to kick off in the other area with something
[2:55:55.220 --> 2:55:59.860]  to get the newspapers on board you know on their side talking about something that he's doing wrong
[2:55:59.860 --> 2:56:05.460]  but I actually think now nobody believes a word of it and it's about time some of the Democrats
[2:56:06.100 --> 2:56:11.380]  had some backbone and stood up and said listen when we're not going along with this anymore
[2:56:11.380 --> 2:56:16.180]  I mean are they all that corrupt that there's blackmail on all of them that none of them can
[2:56:16.180 --> 2:56:20.500]  can say a word because that's what it looks like doesn't it that is definitely what it looks like
[2:56:20.500 --> 2:56:24.340]  and I think the reason it looks that way is that is in fact what the intelligence community's power
[2:56:24.340 --> 2:56:29.460]  has been over time you've seen that the senators and the house members are pointed to the
[2:56:29.460 --> 2:56:34.020]  intelligence committee particularly in the senate on both political sides senator burr is
[2:56:34.020 --> 2:56:38.260]  particularly problematic in the way he has handled that committee I've had to deal with
[2:56:38.260 --> 2:56:42.340]  the senate intelligence committee on behalf of trump supporters and what I can tell you is
[2:56:42.340 --> 2:56:46.420]  that in my experience with him the democrats run that committee even when the republicans are
[2:56:46.420 --> 2:56:51.620]  nominally in charge so your questions and comments are precisely on point it reflects a disturbing
[2:56:51.620 --> 2:56:56.420]  and disconcerting a disconcerting pattern of behavior by the establishment republicans in
[2:56:56.420 --> 2:57:00.580]  Washington in the establishment press not to stand yeah and Laura you've made some really good
[2:57:00.580 --> 2:57:05.540]  points I was listening to you in there I was in between things working on getting this clip
[2:57:05.540 --> 2:57:10.260]  and getting it eq'd we've been able to fix the audio so it's very very clear I was just listening
[2:57:10.260 --> 2:57:15.700]  to it it's bombshell he's calling them scum criminals they're all scum but of course it's
[2:57:15.700 --> 2:57:20.980]  buried in an article about how he's intimidating people this is bombshell I mean this is the
[2:57:20.980 --> 2:57:24.500]  president really going after this is what we'd expect to hear absolutely a little bit of an
[2:57:24.500 --> 2:57:28.260]  exciting freak out here running around like a chicken on my head cut off because this is really
[2:57:28.260 --> 2:57:32.260]  historic folks I mean we're fighting for the whole damn future of this country Laura thank you so

[3:00:23.620 --> 3:00:27.380]  i gotta apologize the crew and some of the stuff on here i'm like flipping out and give me this
[3:00:27.380 --> 3:00:32.740]  clip give me that clip um i was reading the transcript of what trump said i went and watched
[3:00:32.740 --> 3:00:36.100]  the video i mean i ran out of here for a few minutes but i could hear the lady in the background
[3:00:36.100 --> 3:00:41.780]  that's why she was a good call um i've actually only had three cups of coffee today but i am lit
[3:00:41.780 --> 3:00:48.500]  ladies and gentlemen um i mean wait till you hear trump's speech that they surreptitiously
[3:00:48.500 --> 3:00:52.180]  recorded when he's talking to the diplomats next segment the segment after that then barnes is
[3:00:52.180 --> 3:00:56.500]  going to host the rest of the hour um because i got to get a haircut man i'm like a hippie but

[3:01:06.740 --> 3:01:13.700]  friday um but uh barnes this country's in a real war for its heart and soul and people get upset
[3:01:13.700 --> 3:01:18.740]  about their football team losing or winning i'm on the edge of my damn seat here i mean i am my
[3:01:18.740 --> 3:01:23.220]  heart rate's not really up but my brain is just like speeding well as we were discussing the last
[3:01:23.220 --> 3:01:28.180]  caller whoa after trump beat back the molar effort i think he gave him confidence to double down in
[3:01:28.180 --> 3:01:33.380]  his battles against the deep state and to end the democratic corrupt elites to implement a truly
[3:01:33.380 --> 3:01:39.380]  democratizing american spirit of 1776 agenda for the whole world and now he sees what the deep
[3:01:39.380 --> 3:01:43.140]  state is doing is they're doubling down the democratic elite corrupt elites are doubling
[3:01:43.140 --> 3:01:47.540]  down on trying to take him out rather than recognizing that the failed effort of molar should
[3:01:47.540 --> 3:01:53.220]  have given them a warning signal and a warning sign a stop sign to not go any further they're
[3:01:53.220 --> 3:01:58.340]  done they're going to doubly speed through that stop listen to this he added what appeared to be
[3:01:58.340 --> 3:02:02.420]  a thinly veiled thread no i mean this is treason it's not a threat yeah you know what we used to
[3:02:02.420 --> 3:02:08.020]  do in the old days when we were smart right the spies and treason we used to handle it differently
[3:02:08.020 --> 3:02:12.580]  than we do now they are literally trying to bring the country down absolutely he's pointing out that
[3:02:12.580 --> 3:02:16.660]  you're trying to not only kill the king you're trying to kill the people who elected that king
[3:02:16.660 --> 3:02:20.980]  you're trying to kill the dream of the american experiment for the whole world and he's not
[3:02:20.980 --> 3:02:24.340]  going to allow it to happen and he's like those people that keep coming for me and those people
[3:02:24.340 --> 3:02:28.020]  that keep coming for the american people and those people that keep coming for the american dream
[3:02:28.020 --> 3:02:33.220]  are going to face legal can you believe trump is a trump is a maniac i love it oh yeah i mean it
[3:02:33.220 --> 3:02:37.140]  shows he's completely fearless that he what he learned he learned the right lesson from the
[3:02:37.140 --> 3:02:42.420]  molar experiment which was don't uh don't back down don't apologize that's what stone's on him
[3:02:42.420 --> 3:02:47.700]  like 40 something years he says no trump isn't even courage he's very fatalistic he doesn't care
[3:02:47.700 --> 3:02:51.860]  exactly except about beating these people well it's what nelson mendela realized nelson mendela
[3:02:51.860 --> 3:02:56.500]  used to sing himself a poem and when he was in prison in south africa which is that he is the
[3:02:56.500 --> 3:03:01.380]  captain of his own fate he's the master of his own destiny based on an old english poem and it's
[3:03:01.380 --> 3:03:05.780]  what it's based upon is it's self-empowerment when you realize that the system cannot take you out
[3:03:05.780 --> 3:03:12.020]  or if they can you forfeit the fear connected to it then that is incredibly empowering you realize
[3:03:12.020 --> 3:03:17.540]  i'm going to do what is right because i no longer worry about the consequences of what i cannot control
[3:03:17.540 --> 3:03:22.420]  and because of that it's like what the the god footprints poem is all about it's you give up
[3:03:22.420 --> 3:03:26.980]  worries about things you can't control seize the things you can control and do what's right and
[3:03:26.980 --> 3:03:32.020]  righteous regardless of the consequence i just hear people saying oh life's so boring oh there's
[3:03:32.020 --> 3:03:37.220]  so many netflix shows are all boring this country is in the middle of fighting for its life right now
[3:03:37.780 --> 3:03:43.220]  and thank god they surreptitiously you know record he's up there on a big stage well maybe trump
[3:03:43.220 --> 3:03:47.620]  even had himself leaked no i'm sure he wanted to be able to say well this isn't my official statement
[3:03:47.620 --> 3:03:52.980]  but this is really war this is a call this is a paul revere call to patriots to get together
[3:03:52.980 --> 3:03:57.700]  to rally behind the president against the deep state against the democratic corruption in congress
[3:03:57.700 --> 3:04:01.940]  against the democratic corrupt elites against the corrupt media establishment that wants to lie
[3:04:01.940 --> 3:04:06.820]  and libel him on a routine and regular base he calls him sick he calls him scum he says we're at war
[3:04:06.820 --> 3:04:13.300]  he says it's treason i mean this is just over the top exciting and i guess i've got to come in here

[3:06:14.500 --> 3:06:19.700]  who's ever when i was in high school twice i got convinced at parties to do a rail of metham
[3:06:19.700 --> 3:06:26.740]  fetamine and i'd be up for two days and thought i was gonna die threw up said i never do it again
[3:06:26.740 --> 3:06:32.500]  did it one more time swear i never do it again never did same thing hate cocaine i am naturally
[3:06:32.500 --> 3:06:39.060]  awake but i i can tell you right now i feel like when i did a rail of metham fetamine when i was
[3:06:39.060 --> 3:06:47.220]  16 i mean i literally and just my brain is exploding right now with just the realization
[3:06:47.220 --> 3:06:53.620]  but also the energy and the atmosphere politically and how much danger this nation's in and how
[3:06:53.620 --> 3:06:59.620]  truly able the globalist are and then trump is up there swinging for the fences we're about to
[3:06:59.620 --> 3:07:06.420]  play this video that's getting a little bit of attention oh it's threats on whistleblowers
[3:07:06.420 --> 3:07:11.300]  well what do you do when people are in your administration lie about you put out fake statements
[3:07:11.300 --> 3:07:15.220]  on what you did you released the transcript and they're from the cia trying to undermine
[3:07:15.220 --> 3:07:20.740]  elected president it is treason when we're in a war with china right now corporate economic and spy
[3:07:21.860 --> 3:07:26.900]  and so it's the facts and and and i hate to use the drug analogy barns but i mean how are you
[3:07:26.900 --> 3:07:31.300]  feeling right now well it's empowering to realize that the president of the united states is willing
[3:07:31.300 --> 3:07:36.900]  to stand up for the american people against these degrees of threats of basically espionage of
[3:07:36.900 --> 3:07:43.220]  extortion that's the kind of behavior this leaker this rat this spy this non whistleblower was
[3:07:43.220 --> 3:07:47.700]  engaged you know the awake feeling though you get when they call up god forbid and you know uh
[3:07:48.660 --> 3:07:52.900]  your your mom's had a heart attack or something yeah it's like that fully awake thing but it's
[3:07:52.900 --> 3:07:58.260]  not even a good feeling well you're saying energized you're saying you feel good man i just
[3:07:58.260 --> 3:08:02.900]  am pissed the general public doesn't realize what the situation we're in well i mean are you
[3:08:02.900 --> 3:08:07.860]  physiologically feeling this or i guess you're just too calm i think there's an awakening across the
[3:08:07.860 --> 3:08:11.700]  board that the president is triggering that has continued i mean even the tremendous we're feeling
[3:08:11.700 --> 3:08:16.100]  the fear of the enemy no i think we're uh the awakening of the american people to the risk and
[3:08:16.100 --> 3:08:21.540]  the threat that exists that has continued to exist i think that to a lot i mean the term deep state
[3:08:21.540 --> 3:08:25.780]  was a term that many americans had never even heard before president trump yeah and now world
[3:08:25.780 --> 3:08:30.740]  government communism new world order pedophile rings it's all out in the open exactly he's
[3:08:30.740 --> 3:08:34.660]  awakening and so actually you're saying we're winning exactly absolutely in terms of the mindset
[3:08:34.660 --> 3:08:39.540]  of the american people the threat is that those who hold in wield power unlawfully are going to
[3:08:39.540 --> 3:08:44.500]  continue to fight again but how crazy is it is that america's history and now we've got a president
[3:08:44.500 --> 3:08:49.380]  like this and it's just so incredible and then and then like almost feel guilty i've criticized
[3:08:49.380 --> 3:08:54.420]  trump sum well it's like living i mean this is just it's like being alive in 1775 that's what it's
[3:08:54.420 --> 3:08:59.300]  like it's like being in a little bar a little pub in boston in 1775 and the sons of liberty
[3:08:59.300 --> 3:09:03.460]  are getting together and organizing to begin the first true democratic revolution in the history
[3:09:03.460 --> 3:09:08.900]  of the world that's what it's like well absolutely and you know all of us are empathetic or at least
[3:09:08.900 --> 3:09:13.860]  that we've tuned into that we are and i'm very uh you know i'm gonna pick up what's going on yeah
[3:09:13.860 --> 3:09:20.660]  and i mean well i mean you you feel that energy oh man i think it's a great thing that it's great
[3:09:20.660 --> 3:09:25.060]  and risky at the same time it'd be like being sitting with martin luther king in 1963 when
[3:09:25.060 --> 3:09:28.580]  you're about to go out on a march where you know you're gonna get arrested and beaten it's like that
[3:09:28.580 --> 3:09:33.140]  you know the enemy is real but you know the possibility of reform is real and so both are
[3:09:33.140 --> 3:09:39.220]  sit the both sit right at the crossroads for everybody to take a chance and so the uh that's
[3:09:39.220 --> 3:09:42.660]  where we're at and that's what the president's making clear to everybody and he's probably a
[3:09:42.660 --> 3:09:46.900]  situation where he's leaking the tape himself because he wants people aware but he wants people
[3:09:46.900 --> 3:09:51.140]  to be aware in a certain way absolutely we're gonna get to your calls after we play this we'll
[3:09:51.140 --> 3:09:57.300]  take this segment the next here's trump closed door gathering with us diplomats in new york
[3:09:57.300 --> 3:10:02.820]  attack democratic rival joe biden the sparrows whistleblower complaint said we're at war they're
[3:10:02.820 --> 3:10:10.820]  sick sick people they're scum it's treason here it is really going to be a star and the only
[3:10:10.820 --> 3:10:16.020]  way you're a star no matter how you look or feel or talk is when you make good deals okay i found
[3:10:16.020 --> 3:10:20.740]  that out over here you gotta make good deals otherwise it's over and uh she's doing great
[3:10:20.740 --> 3:10:27.300]  deals i was with her now for three days and she's developed incredible relationships in a very
[3:10:27.300 --> 3:10:33.860]  short period of time and we appreciate it and you'll be out there you'll be in the firing line
[3:10:33.860 --> 3:10:39.060]  today for instance i just heard well you know while i'm coming up here you know they have a whistleblower
[3:10:39.060 --> 3:10:47.940]  out of this we think he's attack highly partisan whistleblower uh the lord has contributed to buying
[3:10:47.940 --> 3:10:53.140]  they contributed the whole thing is but more importantly you know the whistleblower was
[3:10:53.140 --> 3:10:58.420]  the same letter that we announced yesterday which was perfect it was i couldn't have looked
[3:10:58.420 --> 3:11:04.980]  at better if i wrote it myself i could not have said or had a better conversation and we had a
[3:11:04.980 --> 3:11:12.260]  really nice gentleman and the president of ukraine yesterday and uh he was sued they said what is he
[3:11:12.260 --> 3:11:17.220]  pressuring you you know these animals in the bush they're animals so it's so that we're sure we'll
[3:11:17.220 --> 3:11:24.340]  reach a lot of people thank you thank you many of them were scum many of you have some good reports
[3:11:24.340 --> 3:11:31.140]  but i'll be honest with you but and that's one of the things we battle and you'll find out but
[3:11:31.140 --> 3:11:37.060]  they're probably like you don't know like me but i haven't yet i see it right right but they total
[3:11:37.780 --> 3:11:43.780]  just terrible dishonest people and uh they wouldn't they couldn't figure out what do we say bad about
[3:11:43.780 --> 3:11:49.620]  this conversation then it turns out that they had senators democrats senators that went over there
[3:11:49.620 --> 3:11:55.140]  and strong on the gun you better damn well do this or you're not going to get any money from your
[3:11:55.140 --> 3:12:01.540]  congress oh i see that's okay and then you have to sleep each other by the news don't know why
[3:12:03.620 --> 3:12:10.180]  this guy was dumb in his best day and he's not having his best day right now he's dumb as a rock
[3:12:10.180 --> 3:12:15.380]  so you're sleeping Joe and he goes up and his kid who's got a lot of problems he got thrown out of
[3:12:15.380 --> 3:12:20.900]  the Navy through the profits and we look i'm not gonna this is a problem that that's a problem
[3:12:20.900 --> 3:12:27.060]  because so we won't get into why he got thrown out of the Navy and now this kid goes into Ukraine
[3:12:27.060 --> 3:12:33.300]  walks away with millions of dollars and he becomes a consultant for 50,000 a month and he doesn't
[3:12:33.300 --> 3:12:40.420]  know anything compared to anybody in this room okay he's just stiff he knows nothing he's walking
[3:12:40.420 --> 3:12:46.900]  away with 50,000 or as you would say in the old days 50k a month not bad not bad would anybody
[3:12:46.900 --> 3:12:59.060]  else in this room want to represent you? That's on top of hundreds of thousands and millions of
[3:12:59.060 --> 3:13:06.020]  dollars but that's not the best one the best one is the China this came up so now he goes to China
[3:13:06.020 --> 3:13:10.820]  and i was with the head of Blackstone which is the big deal state force but i said see was that
[3:13:10.820 --> 3:13:16.820]  possible now why why who got that who got that and i said back and said oh well then you know he
[3:13:16.820 --> 3:13:24.180]  said maybe i should be involved you know who was right over there i say i say Steve what happens
[3:13:24.180 --> 3:13:30.500]  when you come off a vice presidential plane it's called Air Force two you follow this with you you
[3:13:30.500 --> 3:13:37.860]  walk into a room in China and they give you a fund of 1.5 billion billion dollars you make
[3:13:37.860 --> 3:13:42.820]  hundreds of thousands of dollars and millions of dollars out of that that's probably not all the
[3:13:42.820 --> 3:13:48.580]  game they gave plenty for i'm sure who might never find out and then they talk about me and i didn't
[3:13:48.580 --> 3:13:55.620]  do anything i don't know if i'm the most innocent person in the world but you know you look at that
[3:13:55.620 --> 3:14:01.220]  most presidential like i said i'm the most presidential except for possibly Abe Lincoln when
[3:14:01.220 --> 3:14:06.580]  he wore that that was tough to me honestly when he wore that hat that was tough to me but i can't
[3:14:06.580 --> 3:14:15.380]  do that that one was better it was a yeah but honestly but it was tough to me remember we used
[3:14:15.380 --> 3:14:21.940]  to do that during the campaign they used to say when i speak they probably be crazy i go great
[3:14:21.940 --> 3:14:25.940]  we're not going great we have a lot of fun together right we have 25 that we had we've never
[3:14:25.940 --> 3:14:31.940]  had an empty seat from the day i came down the escalator were they potential unbelievable
[3:14:31.940 --> 3:14:35.700]  woman who became a first lady
[3:14:42.980 --> 3:14:48.580]  but we've never had an empty seat not one i would yeah i would believe that there was one case
[3:14:48.580 --> 3:14:55.140]  where we had a tremendous snowstorm it was and it was just about frozen mess or it was like a
[3:14:55.140 --> 3:15:00.100]  monster storm i don't even know how i got there i said how's the crowd it's just about full sir i
[3:15:00.100 --> 3:15:04.100]  said what does that mean like there's about two seats on top thousands and thousands of people
[3:15:04.100 --> 3:15:10.900]  who get there so they show pictures of the empty seats i don't say this is the worst storm they've
[3:15:10.900 --> 3:15:15.940]  had in us they show pictures of like nine empty seats they could have been people this is supposedly

[3:19:08.100 --> 3:19:14.020]  future of the planet the future does not belong to globalists and then trump went after them on
[3:19:14.020 --> 3:19:18.980]  how the chai cons are stealing intellectual property dependent on massive market barriers
[3:19:18.980 --> 3:19:24.740]  heavy state subsidies currency manipulation force technology transfers and the theft of

[3:20:42.100 --> 3:20:48.980]  trump talking to the diplomatic corps here it is
[3:20:48.980 --> 3:20:52.980]  good location if you can but get the biggest arena we did it the other night Tuesday night
[3:20:53.700 --> 3:21:00.500]  we had two congressmen one was possibly going to when he was up by two we went by about 27 i think
[3:21:00.500 --> 3:21:06.420]  or something like that a lot the other one was down by 17 and they said sir no campaign form
[3:21:06.420 --> 3:21:11.700]  that's why because if he loses they're gonna kid you the press i said they're gonna kill me whether i can't
[3:21:11.700 --> 3:21:17.140]  pay for that sorry don't make a little bit worse you know they'll say you worked and he failed
[3:21:17.140 --> 3:21:22.820]  trump failed that was down 17 points and he ended up winning by a lot you know he ended up winning
[3:21:22.820 --> 3:21:28.180]  by a lot tried to hold and i'd see an end and we built the most beautiful two million dollar maybe
[3:21:28.180 --> 3:21:32.660]  they spent the one that i was in the rest of no range and they built it studios all over the place
[3:21:32.660 --> 3:21:41.380]  but they had a studio the studio was going to stay up for weeks and toward the end of the night
[3:21:41.380 --> 3:21:46.500]  they were taking it down there's so-called stars were leaving bad stars they're not many stars
[3:21:47.860 --> 3:21:52.900]  less than six but they were taking the stars were leaving and they didn't want to put it but
[3:21:52.900 --> 3:21:59.140]  the candidate David Bishop won by a lot he was down by 17 and they had lines a mile long i mean
[3:21:59.140 --> 3:22:04.900]  the lines going into them as long as we're unbelievable and without the rally speech and a
[3:22:04.900 --> 3:22:12.180]  couple of tweets and Twitter stuff is good we are like way over a hundred million people on six or
[3:22:12.180 --> 3:22:17.620]  seven different platforms it's actually much higher than that even higher than just about everybody
[3:22:18.260 --> 3:22:25.140]  and it helps it helps they have sons oftentimes when i speak they said please keep this woman
[3:22:25.140 --> 3:22:32.500]  the other night beautiful woman she's got a son please keep tweeting sir it matters because we
[3:22:32.500 --> 3:22:39.060]  got our voices and i wouldn't do that i can't say what a great job Kelly sir and i can't say we're
[3:22:39.060 --> 3:22:44.100]  a wonderful house and the husband she had nothing to do with you she's a rich man too it's modern
[3:22:44.100 --> 3:22:48.820]  what are you doing why are you working he's talking about his wife he can't leave his office
[3:22:48.820 --> 3:22:56.020]  that's really great don it's good like you are proud of him he said very much and he's
[3:22:56.020 --> 3:23:03.380]  really a fantastic guy he's been a friend of mine for a long time before i met Kelly i met Joe and
[3:23:03.380 --> 3:23:09.540]  Joe who invested because of his knowledge of energy now he could be paid okay you're gonna pay a guy
[3:23:10.580 --> 3:23:16.500]  now he wouldn't take it so yeah that's not uh he's not quite good enough although he might
[3:23:16.500 --> 3:23:22.260]  he might it's easy money Joe you have to say but he would be an expert of energy he'd be a real
[3:23:22.260 --> 3:23:27.220]  expert and he would be uh someone that just spent a lot of money too but not about himself
[3:23:27.220 --> 3:23:32.660]  so the whistleblower came out and said nothing he said a couple of people told me he had a
[3:23:32.660 --> 3:23:41.060]  conversation with Ukraine we're in a war these people are sick they're sick and nobody scrolled
[3:23:41.060 --> 3:23:45.380]  it out like i do i don't understand people are afraid to call it out they're afraid to say that
[3:23:45.380 --> 3:23:50.580]  the press is crooked we have a crooked press we haven't decided to meet them so now they're
[3:23:50.580 --> 3:23:54.420]  devastated but they'll always find something i'm sure there'll be something they'll find in this
[3:23:55.060 --> 3:24:02.500]  report that will suit their right but basically that person never saw the report never saw the
[3:24:02.500 --> 3:24:09.860]  call we never saw the call her excited and decided that he or she whatever the hell it is
[3:24:09.860 --> 3:24:15.540]  oh i'm almost a spy i want to know who's the person that gave the whistleblower who's the
[3:24:15.540 --> 3:24:21.140]  person that gave the whistleblower the information because that's close to a spy you know what we
[3:24:21.140 --> 3:24:27.060]  used to do in the old days when we were smart right the spies and treason we used to handle
[3:24:27.060 --> 3:24:32.980]  the little differently than what you know now you have guys like a little Adam Schiff
[3:24:32.980 --> 3:24:41.380]  defending you that thing's about the neck it's about the neck it's about this big
[3:24:41.380 --> 3:24:45.940]  big he's got shit so too big as you can't buy shirts that's cold he was never a cold minor
[3:24:45.940 --> 3:24:49.860]  here let's put it down i don't think he worked in the mines do you think i don't think so these
[3:24:49.860 --> 3:24:53.780]  miners come out we love our miners so they come out they have hands on them they shake our
[3:24:53.780 --> 3:25:00.660]  drug user i love you sir but we gave him back their jobs they were dead and you know hillary came in
[3:25:00.660 --> 3:25:02.380]  and just before the questioner came, he says,
[3:25:02.380 --> 3:25:06.420]  no, we want the muggers, we're going to retrain them.
[3:25:06.420 --> 3:25:08.540]  And then I think, can you imagine a miner
[3:25:08.540 --> 3:25:11.580]  with massive arms, shoulders, and gloves,
[3:25:11.580 --> 3:25:14.340]  what they're doing, stitching in a line,
[3:25:14.340 --> 3:25:16.100]  little tiny winches.
[3:25:16.100 --> 3:25:19.100]  They're putting little tiny computer cards together.
[3:25:19.100 --> 3:25:21.380]  There's a big strong, and they don't want me killing them.
[3:25:21.380 --> 3:25:23.100]  And I said to them, it's the only time
[3:25:23.100 --> 3:25:25.420]  they haven't got any of me, I said to them,
[3:25:25.420 --> 3:25:27.500]  that was supposing, is there any trust,
[3:25:27.500 --> 3:25:29.700]  supposing we take you out of that business?
[3:25:29.700 --> 3:25:35.660]  And we do retrain you, and you go into technology, OK?
[3:25:35.660 --> 3:25:38.820]  They almost threw up all over the place.
[3:25:38.820 --> 3:25:40.220]  And it's a funny thing, you know, to me,
[3:25:40.220 --> 3:25:42.740]  I call them dangerous and rough stuff,
[3:25:42.740 --> 3:25:45.140]  but it's become much safer.
[3:25:45.140 --> 3:25:47.660]  In Australia now, they have no black lung disease.
[3:25:47.660 --> 3:25:49.260]  They really got all of that dust out,
[3:25:49.260 --> 3:25:51.300]  and they've done a fantastic job of more coffee
[3:25:51.300 --> 3:25:52.300]  in that system.
[3:25:52.300 --> 3:25:54.820]  We give credit where credit is due.
[3:25:54.820 --> 3:25:56.460]  But it's incredible.
[3:25:56.460 --> 3:25:59.100]  But, you know, they were talking about retraining these guys.
[3:25:59.100 --> 3:26:01.660]  And by the way, I was thinking about doing a walk-in,
[3:26:01.660 --> 3:26:03.140]  and I look at these big rough guys,
[3:26:03.140 --> 3:26:04.700]  and I said, nah, they don't want to do that.
[3:26:04.700 --> 3:26:06.460]  And I said, well, would you want that?
[3:26:06.460 --> 3:26:08.820]  Would you want any retraining?
[3:26:08.820 --> 3:26:11.740]  And the one guy actually said, sir, my great-grandfather
[3:26:11.740 --> 3:26:15.540]  was a miner, my grandfather, my father, and I'm a miner,
[3:26:15.540 --> 3:26:16.860]  and we love our life.
[3:26:16.860 --> 3:26:17.940]  We want to dig coal.
[3:26:17.940 --> 3:26:19.100]  That's what we want to do, sir.
[3:26:19.100 --> 3:26:20.100]  We don't want anything else.
[3:26:20.100 --> 3:26:21.260]  We want to just dig coal.
[3:26:21.260 --> 3:26:22.300]  That's true.
[3:26:22.300 --> 3:26:24.900]  You couldn't, if I said I'm going to give you a farm on Fifth
[3:26:24.900 --> 3:26:26.940]  Avenue, you come with me, you're going to have a great time
[3:26:26.940 --> 3:26:28.140]  in New York.
[3:26:28.140 --> 3:26:29.820]  They would say, oh, thank you.
[3:26:29.820 --> 3:26:31.660]  Just the way it is, you know, that's their life.
[3:26:31.660 --> 3:26:32.460]  That's what they want.
[3:26:32.460 --> 3:26:33.140]  They love it.
[3:26:33.140 --> 3:26:35.140]  They don't want to do anything different.
[3:26:35.140 --> 3:26:36.660]  And I understand.
[3:26:36.660 --> 3:26:39.220]  I'm the only fool that decided to do something.
[3:26:39.220 --> 3:26:40.980]  I had a great life.
[3:26:40.980 --> 3:26:44.540]  And I said, that's run for president in this country, yeah.
[3:26:44.540 --> 3:26:47.420]  And we've been hitting harder than anybody in history.
[3:26:47.420 --> 3:26:48.420]  And we're done.
[3:26:48.420 --> 3:26:48.920]  Thank you.
[3:26:48.920 --> 3:26:49.420]  Thank you.
[3:26:49.420 --> 3:26:49.920]  Thank you.
[3:26:49.920 --> 3:26:50.420]  Thank you.
[3:26:50.420 --> 3:26:50.920]  Thank you.
[3:26:50.920 --> 3:26:51.420]  Thank you.
[3:26:51.420 --> 3:26:51.920]  Thank you.
[3:26:51.920 --> 3:26:52.420]  Thank you.
[3:26:52.420 --> 3:26:54.420]  Thank you.
[3:26:54.420 --> 3:26:58.420]  I'm going to ask a lot of people, though, no rich guys have
[3:26:58.420 --> 3:27:00.420]  a run for politics, I can tell you.
[3:27:00.420 --> 3:27:02.420]  If anybody did this, I don't think they'd have a run.
[3:27:02.420 --> 3:27:04.420]  But I love doing it.
[3:27:04.420 --> 3:27:07.420]  And I guess I love it because we've made so much progress.
[3:27:07.420 --> 3:27:09.420]  And you're really a big part of it.
[3:27:09.420 --> 3:27:11.420]  And you know our deputy permanent representative,
[3:27:11.420 --> 3:27:13.420]  Ambassador Jonathan Cohen, maybe here.
[3:27:13.420 --> 3:27:15.420]  Jonathan, where's Jonathan?
[3:27:15.420 --> 3:27:16.420]  Is he here?
[3:27:16.420 --> 3:27:17.420]  Yes, sir.
[3:27:17.420 --> 3:27:18.420]  Yes, sir.
[3:27:18.420 --> 3:27:19.420]  Yes, sir.
[3:27:19.420 --> 3:27:22.420]  I just want to give you a big round of applause.
[3:27:22.420 --> 3:27:24.420]  Thank you, John.
[3:27:24.420 --> 3:27:27.420]  Everybody's saying what a good job he's doing.
[3:27:27.420 --> 3:27:28.420]  So, Jonathan, thank you.
[3:27:28.420 --> 3:27:29.420]  Good luck.
[3:27:29.420 --> 3:27:30.420]  Do well.
[3:27:30.420 --> 3:27:35.420]  We have plenty of, I call them points of confliction, right?
[3:27:35.420 --> 3:27:37.420]  Points of confliction.
[3:27:37.420 --> 3:27:40.420]  But you don't realize how important you are.
[3:27:40.420 --> 3:27:42.420]  You make it all possible.
[3:27:42.420 --> 3:27:44.420]  And I've always said about the United Nations,
[3:27:44.420 --> 3:27:47.420]  it has more potential than any institution that I've ever dealt
[3:27:47.420 --> 3:27:48.420]  with.
[3:27:48.420 --> 3:27:51.420]  It hasn't lived up to its potential.
[3:27:51.420 --> 3:27:52.420]  It's starting to war.
[3:27:52.420 --> 3:27:55.420]  I think one of the reasons it is because I feel that way,
[3:27:55.420 --> 3:27:59.420]  I will use the United Nations to our benefit as a country.
[3:27:59.420 --> 3:28:01.420]  And because I'm doing it, others are doing it,
[3:28:01.420 --> 3:28:03.420]  and we're sort of getting together and doing things
[3:28:03.420 --> 3:28:04.420]  in a special way.
[3:28:04.420 --> 3:28:07.420]  And Nikki did a great job, and Kelly's going to do a great
[3:28:07.420 --> 3:28:09.420]  job, and it's very important.
[3:28:09.420 --> 3:28:11.420]  This position is so important.
[3:28:11.420 --> 3:28:13.420]  So important.
[3:28:13.420 --> 3:28:17.420]  It's another thing that I think was underrated,
[3:28:17.420 --> 3:28:19.420]  that the importance of your position,
[3:28:19.420 --> 3:28:21.420]  I think it was very underrated.
[3:28:21.420 --> 3:28:24.420]  But you have the right person in that position.
[3:28:24.420 --> 3:28:27.420]  But the United Nations is going to finally live up to its
[3:28:27.420 --> 3:28:28.420]  potential.
[3:28:28.420 --> 3:28:31.420]  It's really got something.
[3:28:31.420 --> 3:28:33.420]  And I like you, Secretary General.
[3:28:33.420 --> 3:28:35.420]  He's really working hard.
[3:28:35.420 --> 3:28:37.420]  He's always on the ball.
[3:28:37.420 --> 3:28:39.420]  He's always there if you need him.
[3:28:39.420 --> 3:28:40.420]  I really like him.
[3:28:40.420 --> 3:28:43.420]  So I think he has the stuff, the right stuff.
[3:28:43.420 --> 3:28:46.420]  If you have a video from the President of the United States,
[3:28:46.420 --> 3:28:49.420]  talk more about it on the other side of the break,
[3:28:49.420 --> 3:28:50.420]  and take your calls.
[3:28:50.420 --> 3:29:19.420]  We'll see you next time.
[3:29:20.420 --> 3:29:21.420]  Thank you.
[3:29:51.420 --> 3:29:53.420]  September is almost over.
[3:29:53.420 --> 3:29:56.420]  And right now we're offering store-wide free shipping,
[3:29:56.420 --> 3:30:00.420]  double Patriot points, and 50% off for a limited time.
[3:30:00.420 --> 3:30:03.420]  As a lot of you know, I don't play by the establishment's
[3:30:03.420 --> 3:30:04.420]  rules.
[3:30:04.420 --> 3:30:07.420]  In fact, I like to hijack things they've created and turn it
[3:30:07.420 --> 3:30:10.420]  towards the use of the people and the information war.
[3:30:10.420 --> 3:30:12.420]  And we're doing that right now with a big game changer.
[3:30:12.420 --> 3:30:16.420]  We're going to bring you real Black Friday prices months
[3:30:16.420 --> 3:30:19.420]  early in late September and early October.
[3:30:19.420 --> 3:30:23.420]  It's going to run as long as supplies last across the board,
[3:30:23.420 --> 3:30:28.420]  at least 50% off, store-wide, free shipping, double Patriot
[3:30:28.420 --> 3:30:30.420]  points, and more.
[3:30:30.420 --> 3:30:34.420]  We've not done this, ladies and gentlemen, since last Christmas.
[3:30:34.420 --> 3:30:36.420]  But I want you to take advantage of this.
[3:30:36.420 --> 3:30:40.420]  We need funds to run our operations, so it is a win-win.
[3:30:40.420 --> 3:30:41.420]  We're going into 2020.
[3:30:41.420 --> 3:30:43.420]  Info Wars needs the funds.
[3:30:43.420 --> 3:30:44.420]  Plus, these are great products.
[3:30:44.420 --> 3:30:47.420]  Go take advantage of them right now at infowarstore.com
[3:30:47.420 --> 3:30:52.420]  or infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[3:30:52.420 --> 3:30:54.420]  I want to thank the listeners of this broadcast.
[3:30:54.420 --> 3:30:55.420]  I want to thank our affiliates.
[3:30:55.420 --> 3:30:56.420]  I want to thank our sponsors.
[3:30:56.420 --> 3:30:58.420]  I want to thank the Info Wars crew.
[3:30:58.420 --> 3:31:03.420]  And I want to thank God in Heaven, the ruler of our universe,
[3:31:03.420 --> 3:31:08.420]  for the fact that Donald Trump is delivering on so much he's
[3:31:08.420 --> 3:31:09.420]  promised to do.
[3:31:09.420 --> 3:31:13.420]  The speech at the UN is as important as Eisenhower's military
[3:31:13.420 --> 3:31:16.420]  industrial complex, beware of their tyranny speech.
[3:31:16.420 --> 3:31:18.420]  We talked about technological elite.
[3:31:18.420 --> 3:31:23.420]  He came out and he exposed how big tech is a new ruling class
[3:31:23.420 --> 3:31:25.420]  that is manipulating the minds of the people
[3:31:25.420 --> 3:31:28.420]  and engaging in massive oppression.
[3:31:28.420 --> 3:31:33.420]  And he talked about how globalism is not the future of the world.
[3:31:33.420 --> 3:31:37.420]  And Trump has done a great job exposing the UN, the globalists,
[3:31:37.420 --> 3:31:40.420]  and the chai cons in their house that the Rockefellers set up
[3:31:40.420 --> 3:31:42.420]  in New York, the UN.
[3:31:42.420 --> 3:31:44.420]  This was incredible.
[3:31:44.420 --> 3:31:48.420]  The future does not belong to globalists.
[3:31:48.420 --> 3:31:52.420]  The future belongs to patriots.
[3:31:52.420 --> 3:31:55.420]  Do you feel that my style is wrong or my substance is wrong,
[3:31:55.420 --> 3:31:57.420]  trying to fact-check the president?
[3:31:57.420 --> 3:32:01.420]  The deceptive, humpty-dumpty troll known as Brian Stelter,
[3:32:01.420 --> 3:32:04.420]  his little weasel minion, Oliver Darcy,
[3:32:04.420 --> 3:32:07.420]  have made it their life's mission to take patriots off the air
[3:32:07.420 --> 3:32:09.420]  and to censor us.
[3:32:09.420 --> 3:32:11.420]  And of course, he famously said, along with many others,
[3:32:11.420 --> 3:32:13.420]  that Trump is the Info Wars president.
[3:32:13.420 --> 3:32:17.420]  Trump's furious reaction to Facebook's action showcases that he is,
[3:32:17.420 --> 3:32:20.420]  I'm sorry to say, the Info Wars president.
[3:32:20.420 --> 3:32:22.420]  And you know what is true?
[3:32:22.420 --> 3:32:24.420]  Our audience of activists, our guests, our crew,
[3:32:24.420 --> 3:32:28.420]  and my drive and your drive has brought Trump to the White House
[3:32:28.420 --> 3:32:30.420]  and other nationalists to power around the world,
[3:32:30.420 --> 3:32:34.420]  and now Trump's openly coming out declaring war on these globalist tyrants
[3:32:34.420 --> 3:32:36.420]  and their unelected anti-human tyrannies.
[3:32:36.420 --> 3:32:39.420]  So this is a day of great victory, and I salute you all,
[3:32:39.420 --> 3:32:41.420]  but now I'm the thick of the fight.
[3:32:41.420 --> 3:32:45.420]  So infowarstore.com for products you need, massive sales now,
[3:32:45.420 --> 3:32:49.420]  so we can continue on to the future and give these bastards one hell of a fight
[3:32:49.420 --> 3:33:15.420]  until the end, until we've defeated them.
[3:33:15.420 --> 3:33:19.420]  I really like him, so I think he has some stuff.
[3:33:19.420 --> 3:33:21.420]  The ranked stuffers need to say, right?
[3:33:21.420 --> 3:33:22.420]  You know what I'm saying?
[3:33:22.420 --> 3:33:23.420]  A couple of very good books.
[3:33:23.420 --> 3:33:26.420]  But I just came up with this one, and I wanted to thank you.
[3:33:26.420 --> 3:33:27.420]  I wanted to congratulate you.
[3:33:27.420 --> 3:33:29.420]  I wanted to congratulate Jonathan and Kelly.
[3:33:29.420 --> 3:33:31.420]  I didn't know Joe was going to be here,
[3:33:31.420 --> 3:33:34.420]  but I'm happy to see you, gentlemen.
[3:33:34.420 --> 3:33:38.420]  And you folks are fantastic, and just keep it going.
[3:33:38.420 --> 3:33:40.420]  We've got it really rocking.
[3:33:40.420 --> 3:33:41.420]  We're looking good.
[3:33:41.420 --> 3:33:43.420]  We're looking good for another four years,
[3:33:43.420 --> 3:33:48.420]  and now we've got him here.
[3:33:48.420 --> 3:33:51.420]  And what I'm saying right now is that the people have reported, as I say,
[3:33:51.420 --> 3:33:53.420]  we're looking good for another four years,
[3:33:53.420 --> 3:33:55.420]  and they never would want to do another four,
[3:33:55.420 --> 3:33:57.420]  or maybe another five.
[3:33:57.420 --> 3:33:59.420]  And they go, please, just write to Bill Maher.
[3:33:59.420 --> 3:34:01.420]  He goes, there's a lot of somebody out there.
[3:34:01.420 --> 3:34:05.420]  He goes, you know he's going to win, don't you?
[3:34:05.420 --> 3:34:07.420]  He's just so eager that he's going to win.
[3:34:07.420 --> 3:34:09.420]  He says, you know he's going to win.
[3:34:09.420 --> 3:34:12.420]  No, no, I think you know he's going to win.
[3:34:12.420 --> 3:34:14.420]  And you know he's not leaving, don't you?
[3:34:14.420 --> 3:34:16.420]  What do you guys know and what do you mean?
[3:34:16.420 --> 3:34:17.420]  He's not leaving.
[3:34:17.420 --> 3:34:18.420]  He's not leaving yet.
[3:34:18.420 --> 3:34:19.420]  And I thought he was kidding.
[3:34:19.420 --> 3:34:21.420]  He's been sick for years.
[3:34:21.420 --> 3:34:25.420]  So did everybody ever see The Time Magazine while we had it?
[3:34:25.420 --> 3:34:29.420]  2020, 2024, 2028, 2032.
[3:34:29.420 --> 3:34:30.420]  In other words, you know,
[3:34:30.420 --> 3:34:34.420]  we do that to drive them freaking crazy.
[3:34:34.420 --> 3:34:36.420]  So I just want to thank you.
[3:34:36.420 --> 3:34:38.420]  Congratulations to Kelly and Jonathan
[3:34:38.420 --> 3:34:40.420]  and everybody in this room who make it work,
[3:34:40.420 --> 3:34:42.420]  and it's so important.
[3:34:42.420 --> 3:34:44.420]  We're all in peace and we're going to have it.
[3:34:44.420 --> 3:34:45.420]  We'll have it.
[3:34:45.420 --> 3:34:46.420]  We're going to have it.
[3:34:46.420 --> 3:34:47.420]  We have a lot of good things going.
[3:34:47.420 --> 3:34:50.420]  And that is problems with India and Pakistan,
[3:34:50.420 --> 3:34:53.420]  big problems with North Korea.
[3:34:53.420 --> 3:34:55.420]  We have a pretty good relationship going there.
[3:34:55.420 --> 3:34:57.420]  I'll tell you, we have a good relationship going.
[3:34:57.420 --> 3:34:59.420]  But we have a lot of great things going
[3:34:59.420 --> 3:35:00.420]  and you make it possible.
[3:35:00.420 --> 3:35:02.420]  Thank you very much, everybody.
[3:35:02.420 --> 3:35:05.420]  Thank you very much.
[3:35:32.420 --> 3:35:35.420]  Thank you very much.
[3:36:02.420 --> 3:36:05.420]  Thank you very much.
[3:36:32.420 --> 3:36:33.420]  And we ask why.
[3:36:33.420 --> 3:36:36.420]  We ask how can a human being have such anger
[3:36:36.420 --> 3:36:39.420]  toward the greatness of our country's glory?
[3:36:39.420 --> 3:36:41.420]  I'll tell you why.
[3:36:41.420 --> 3:36:45.420]  Because for so long their anger has been growing
[3:36:45.420 --> 3:36:47.420]  and with such deep pain,
[3:36:47.420 --> 3:36:53.420]  with no open heart of loving and seeing the truth.
[3:36:53.420 --> 3:36:55.420]  The truth of what truly matters
[3:36:55.420 --> 3:36:58.420]  is the productivity of what was promised.
[3:36:58.420 --> 3:37:01.420]  And what we, the American people of the United States,
[3:37:01.420 --> 3:37:05.420]  were promised and have received.
[3:37:05.420 --> 3:37:08.420]  And what does the radical left do for such greatness?
[3:37:08.420 --> 3:37:10.420]  They want to destroy.
[3:37:10.420 --> 3:37:16.420]  They want civilization to be run like a corrupt ring.
[3:37:16.420 --> 3:37:18.420]  I say, stand now with Trump.
[3:37:18.420 --> 3:37:20.420]  Let truth prevail.
[3:37:20.420 --> 3:37:24.420]  And may God show all the truth
[3:37:24.420 --> 3:37:28.420]  that we are truly a nation stronger because of our president.
[3:37:28.420 --> 3:37:32.420]  The left are afraid for their power is lessening
[3:37:32.420 --> 3:37:36.420]  with every deal that is accomplished by Donald Trump.
[3:37:36.420 --> 3:37:39.420]  In the name of God and his power for this nation,
[3:37:39.420 --> 3:37:45.420]  let us stay strong and without such evil among us.
[3:37:45.420 --> 3:37:48.420]  God bless.
[3:37:48.420 --> 3:37:51.420]  I could not have been better set by John Voight
[3:37:51.420 --> 3:37:52.420]  in defense of the president
[3:37:52.420 --> 3:37:54.420]  as the president himself talked about today
[3:37:54.420 --> 3:37:56.420]  that we're at war with the deep state.
[3:37:56.420 --> 3:37:59.420]  A war that they are waging and the radical left is waging
[3:37:59.420 --> 3:38:01.420]  and that the democratic political establishment
[3:38:01.420 --> 3:38:03.420]  is waging against truth, against honesty,
[3:38:03.420 --> 3:38:06.420]  against honor, against the spirit of 1776.
[3:38:06.420 --> 3:38:08.420]  So in that same spirit,
[3:38:08.420 --> 3:38:12.420]  let's go to one of our callers, Brad from Pennsylvania.
[3:38:12.420 --> 3:38:14.420]  Thanks, Robert.
[3:38:14.420 --> 3:38:15.420]  I totally agree.
[3:38:15.420 --> 3:38:19.420]  My feeling is it's really the CIA that's behind this
[3:38:19.420 --> 3:38:22.420]  and it's a weaponized media.
[3:38:22.420 --> 3:38:25.420]  They've got that weapon at their disposal.
[3:38:25.420 --> 3:38:29.420]  They've been at war with the American people
[3:38:29.420 --> 3:38:31.420]  and honest presidents since JFK.
[3:38:31.420 --> 3:38:34.420]  They killed him, flat out killed him.
[3:38:34.420 --> 3:38:36.420]  We've never dealt with that.
[3:38:36.420 --> 3:38:38.420]  If you have another honest president,
[3:38:38.420 --> 3:38:41.420]  and this is probably the first one in a long time,
[3:38:41.420 --> 3:38:43.420]  then that's what you're going to run up against.
[3:38:43.420 --> 3:38:45.420]  And since he's been elected,
[3:38:45.420 --> 3:38:49.420]  they've been on the offensive to keep him off balance
[3:38:49.420 --> 3:38:51.420]  and never to let him get comfortable.
[3:38:51.420 --> 3:38:54.420]  And this is just an extension at every turn.
[3:38:54.420 --> 3:38:58.420]  And now that the election coming up, 2020,
[3:38:58.420 --> 3:39:04.420]  this is their first or another attempt to undermine him,
[3:39:04.420 --> 3:39:06.420]  what's your feeling about that?
[3:39:06.420 --> 3:39:07.420]  Oh, absolutely.
[3:39:07.420 --> 3:39:09.420]  I mean, I think the Kennedy assassination
[3:39:09.420 --> 3:39:13.420]  sort of broke the American public's virgin minds,
[3:39:13.420 --> 3:39:15.420]  a civic book version of American history
[3:39:15.420 --> 3:39:17.420]  and American politics and American power.
[3:39:17.420 --> 3:39:19.420]  And what happened is when that happened,
[3:39:19.420 --> 3:39:21.420]  there was a shock that we have never,
[3:39:21.420 --> 3:39:24.420]  the American public has never fully come to terms with,
[3:39:24.420 --> 3:39:27.420]  a realization and a recognition that something was deeply a wall
[3:39:27.420 --> 3:39:29.420]  and deeply a miss in the powers that be
[3:39:29.420 --> 3:39:32.420]  that had entrenched themselves in institutional power.
[3:39:32.420 --> 3:39:35.420]  The doctrine of the deep state originates from a doctrine
[3:39:35.420 --> 3:39:37.420]  called the dual state in political science,
[3:39:37.420 --> 3:39:41.420]  which was originated by a pretty conservative editor
[3:39:41.420 --> 3:39:44.420]  for the economist back in the middle of the 19th century
[3:39:44.420 --> 3:39:46.420]  to explain the dichotomy of a government
[3:39:46.420 --> 3:39:48.420]  that was unresponsive to the people
[3:39:48.420 --> 3:39:50.420]  and unresponsive to elections
[3:39:50.420 --> 3:39:52.420]  and yet could continually wield power
[3:39:52.420 --> 3:39:55.420]  for its own policy, prerogatives and priorities.
[3:39:55.420 --> 3:39:58.420]  And he came up with the idea that there was really a dual state,
[3:39:58.420 --> 3:40:01.420]  one state that was elected, another state that was unelected,
[3:40:01.420 --> 3:40:03.420]  that could continue to exercise power
[3:40:03.420 --> 3:40:06.420]  without regard to the elected will of the public.
[3:40:06.420 --> 3:40:08.420]  That doctrine was further established
[3:40:08.420 --> 3:40:11.420]  by German political science professors in the 1930s
[3:40:11.420 --> 3:40:14.420]  who escaped Germany to try to explain the rise of fascism,
[3:40:14.420 --> 3:40:17.420]  not only in Germany, but in Italy and other countries.
[3:40:17.420 --> 3:40:19.420]  And there are articulation and understanding of it,
[3:40:19.420 --> 3:40:21.420]  including the rise of communism to a certain degree,
[3:40:21.420 --> 3:40:23.420]  was the power of a dual state
[3:40:23.420 --> 3:40:27.420]  to accomplish these kind of anti-democratic objectives.
[3:40:27.420 --> 3:40:29.420]  And so they expanded and deepened
[3:40:29.420 --> 3:40:31.420]  the understanding of the dual state.
[3:40:31.420 --> 3:40:33.420]  This was further expanded by studies
[3:40:33.420 --> 3:40:35.420]  of the United States State Department in the 1950s,
[3:40:35.420 --> 3:40:38.420]  which culminated in Eisenhower's famous speech
[3:40:38.420 --> 3:40:40.420]  and his departure speech in 1961.
[3:40:40.420 --> 3:40:42.420]  Too bad he didn't have the courage to give that speech
[3:40:42.420 --> 3:40:44.420]  a little earlier when it might have some more meaning,
[3:40:44.420 --> 3:40:47.420]  but was still impactful for the purposes of historic legacy,
[3:40:47.420 --> 3:40:51.420]  where he said a military industrial complex was being built up.
[3:40:51.420 --> 3:40:53.420]  And what he was referencing was the dual state
[3:40:53.420 --> 3:40:55.420]  that had been uncovered in the studies of the State Department,
[3:40:55.420 --> 3:40:58.420]  where people were allowed to promulgate and propagate policies
[3:40:58.420 --> 3:41:00.420]  against the will of the elected politicians
[3:41:00.420 --> 3:41:03.420]  and the elected interest of the ordinary everyday voter.
[3:41:03.420 --> 3:41:05.420]  That ultimately reflected itself
[3:41:05.420 --> 3:41:07.420]  in the assassination of John Kennedy,
[3:41:07.420 --> 3:41:11.420]  which has been continually unexplained by the official version
[3:41:11.420 --> 3:41:14.420]  in ways that don't meet evidentiary standards.
[3:41:14.420 --> 3:41:16.420]  That was continued further in the assassination
[3:41:16.420 --> 3:41:19.420]  of Martin Luther King and the assassination of Robert Kennedy,
[3:41:19.420 --> 3:41:21.420]  which further destabilized the public's confidence
[3:41:21.420 --> 3:41:23.420]  in our institutions and whether our institutions
[3:41:23.420 --> 3:41:25.420]  were really recognizing and respecting
[3:41:25.420 --> 3:41:27.420]  the power of the ordinary people.
[3:41:27.420 --> 3:41:30.420]  Then that culminated further in Nixon and Watergate scandal,
[3:41:30.420 --> 3:41:33.420]  which it really unveiled wasn't Watergate itself,
[3:41:33.420 --> 3:41:35.420]  which was in fact a second rate burglary,
[3:41:35.420 --> 3:41:37.420]  but was more what was happening
[3:41:37.420 --> 3:41:39.420]  by the people who took Nixon out.
[3:41:39.420 --> 3:41:42.420]  This included Mark Felt, Deep Throat,
[3:41:42.420 --> 3:41:45.420]  who was actually what the media has constantly hidden.
[3:41:45.420 --> 3:41:47.420]  I had a conversation with Ben Bradley,
[3:41:47.420 --> 3:41:49.420]  the Washington Post editor, the Washington Post,
[3:41:49.420 --> 3:41:51.420]  some years ago about this precise topic
[3:41:51.420 --> 3:41:54.420]  before it was known that I argued with Mr. Bradley
[3:41:54.420 --> 3:41:57.420]  that the real reason why he and Bob Woodward and others
[3:41:57.420 --> 3:41:59.420]  were hiding the identity of Deep Throat
[3:41:59.420 --> 3:42:03.420]  wasn't to protect his sort of virgin impregnability,
[3:42:03.420 --> 3:42:05.420]  but that he wasn't a real whistleblower,
[3:42:05.420 --> 3:42:08.420]  that in fact he was likely a corrupt agent within the FBI,
[3:42:08.420 --> 3:42:12.420]  who was mad that Nixon was trying to dehooverize the FBI.
[3:42:12.420 --> 3:42:15.420]  Later that became confirmed and true when Mark Felt,
[3:42:15.420 --> 3:42:17.420]  what's name was revealed as Deep Throat,
[3:42:17.420 --> 3:42:20.420]  who actually was the man who invented Cointel Pro
[3:42:20.420 --> 3:42:22.420]  and ran Cointel Pro to spy on Americans.
[3:42:22.420 --> 3:42:24.420]  Now we have another fake whistleblower,
[3:42:24.420 --> 3:42:26.420]  an actual rogue CIA agent,
[3:42:26.420 --> 3:42:28.420]  connected allied party to John Brennan
[3:42:28.420 --> 3:42:31.420]  trying to take down the elected president of the United States
[3:42:31.420 --> 3:42:33.420]  to continue to put in the Deep States agenda.
[3:42:33.420 --> 3:42:36.420]  So when we come back on the other half of this segment,
[3:42:36.420 --> 3:42:38.420]  let's get into Paul Joseph Watson's interview
[3:42:38.420 --> 3:42:40.420]  with Stephen Crowder and the continuous effort
[3:42:40.420 --> 3:42:42.420]  of big tech, big media and big state
[3:42:42.420 --> 3:42:45.420]  to undermine democratic freedoms and liberties here in America.
[3:42:45.420 --> 3:43:11.420]  You're in the Alex Jones on the Info World Show.
[3:43:15.420 --> 3:43:44.420]  You're in the Alex Jones on the Info World Show.
