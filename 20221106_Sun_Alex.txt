[00:00.000 --> 00:10.480]  Apple was the first company to remove Alex Jones's hateful anti-government conspiratorial
[00:10.480 --> 00:14.760]  rants from their platform.
[00:14.760 --> 00:17.440]  And other tech companies, as we know, followed their lead.
[00:17.440 --> 00:23.600]  We have the ADL that is openly the arbiter with big tech and the sensors on who can be
[00:23.600 --> 00:28.840]  online, who can basically in the future, with a social credit score, even have a job you're
[00:28.840 --> 00:32.600]  going to be put into ghettos and then into camps under their admitted plans.
[00:32.600 --> 00:37.560]  Whether our children will be arrested and conceivably killed, we're on the edge of a
[00:37.560 --> 00:41.200]  brutal authoritarian system, and it could be a week away.
[00:41.200 --> 00:45.600]  The head of the ADL put out a letter attacking Elon Musk and saying, you will not reinstate
[00:45.600 --> 00:46.600]  President Trump.
[00:46.600 --> 00:48.560]  He is a danger and a terrorist.
[00:48.560 --> 00:54.840]  And they went on to say, Alex Jones is the other big enemy, and he must not be allowed
[00:54.840 --> 00:55.840]  back on Twitter.
[00:55.840 --> 00:59.480]  Now, a lot of people are saying, well, when are we going to see you back on Twitter?
[00:59.480 --> 01:01.720]  I'm not worried about trying to get back on Twitter.
[01:01.720 --> 01:05.960]  I am worried about the social credit score, the debanking that's coming for everybody
[01:05.960 --> 01:08.560]  in the next phase of this real tyranny.
[01:08.560 --> 01:11.160]  You talk about clear and present danger.
[01:11.160 --> 01:17.800]  We're talking about the ability to track and trace and surveil upon subjects from the cradle
[01:17.800 --> 01:23.720]  to the grave, effectively, from the beginning of your life or your children's lives or your
[01:23.720 --> 01:29.680]  grandchildren's lives, they'll have biometric identity markers placed on you and connected
[01:29.680 --> 01:31.720]  with this digital ID.
[01:31.720 --> 01:36.400]  And then all records about all activity will be associated with it.
[01:36.400 --> 01:40.040]  This is not simply some identification.
[01:40.040 --> 01:48.080]  This is a database that is kept in a centralized place by the state and then is a collection
[01:48.080 --> 01:51.960]  of all activities from the beginning of your life onward.
[01:51.960 --> 01:55.400]  But what you're doing going after President Trump and Tucker Carlson and others that are
[01:55.400 --> 02:03.600]  good people is discrediting the ADL and discrediting groups that are against anti-Semitism, and
[02:03.600 --> 02:05.000]  it's a lie.
[02:05.000 --> 02:11.920]  Tucker Carlson has a history of sanitizing stereotypes and of spreading this kind of
[02:11.920 --> 02:13.160]  poison.
[02:13.160 --> 02:19.600]  The great replacement theory, as it's known, is this toxic idea that there are a cabal
[02:19.600 --> 02:26.600]  of Jews plotting to overrun the country with immigrants, Muslims, black people, et cetera,
[02:26.600 --> 02:29.120]  and commit what they call white genocide.
[02:29.120 --> 02:35.720]  It is literally a staple of white supremacist and extremist ideology.
[02:35.720 --> 02:40.920]  This is the coalition of Jewish values, rabbinic group, largest in the country, calls for CEO,
[02:40.920 --> 02:49.240]  Greenblatt's resignation after ADL tweets minimizes the Holocaust.
[02:49.240 --> 02:53.680]  As he said, Tucker Carlson is a Nazi and is as bad as Hitler.
[02:53.680 --> 02:59.400]  The Republican Party today is dominated, driven, and intimidated by Donald Trump and
[02:59.400 --> 03:03.360]  the Magna Republicans, and that is a threat to this country.
[03:03.360 --> 03:07.800]  Yeah, they're a threat, says the guy with the blood red Nazi background and Marines
[03:07.800 --> 03:09.360]  standing behind him.
[03:09.360 --> 03:14.720]  Tucker Carlson's dangerous to tyrants, and the ADL is basically just a group, the globalist
[03:14.720 --> 03:20.120]  rent to go out and call anybody that's for freedom and Nazi, and this major rabbinical
[03:20.120 --> 03:24.000]  organization said, what you're doing is evil.
[03:24.000 --> 03:28.440]  And so the good news is here, people across the board are dumb with the ADL.
[03:28.440 --> 03:34.440]  The bad news is, the anti-defamation league is completely globalist, completely leftist.
[03:34.440 --> 03:40.360]  It defends radical Islam while attacking basic American values and attacking Christians
[03:40.360 --> 03:43.960]  and creating dissension, but that's what the left does.
[03:43.960 --> 03:50.520]  It's just preposterous that a former president who had the election stolen from him was taking
[03:50.520 --> 03:54.800]  off Twitter when he said peacefully march the Capitol, and the left had provocateurs
[03:54.800 --> 03:59.480]  there, and then they falsely claimed that Trump ordered people to attack the Capitol.
[03:59.480 --> 04:00.480]  That's a fraud.
[04:00.480 --> 04:04.880]  Who died and made the ADL our controllers?
[04:04.880 --> 04:07.480]  The greatest propaganda machine in history.
[04:07.480 --> 04:08.480]  Let's think about it.
[04:08.480 --> 04:13.800]  Facebook, YouTube, and Google, Twitter, and others, they reach billions of people.
[04:13.800 --> 04:19.720]  The algorithms, these platforms depend on, deliberately amplify the type of content that
[04:19.720 --> 04:26.720]  keeps users engaged, stories that appeal to our baser instincts and that trigger outrage
[04:26.720 --> 04:27.800]  and fear.
[04:27.800 --> 04:35.160]  It's why YouTube recommended videos by the conspiracist Alex Jones billions of times.
[04:35.160 --> 04:43.000]  Because the closest thing I've seen to Nazis in America is the left and the ADL and the
[04:43.000 --> 04:47.880]  Southern Poverty Law Center and their vaccine passports and their lockdowns and their bullying
[04:47.880 --> 04:52.640]  that violates the Nuremberg Code trying to make us take experimental shots.
[04:52.640 --> 04:56.480]  And the social credit score that'll take your bank account and your job if they don't agree
[04:56.480 --> 04:59.600]  with your political views, that's already happening.
[04:59.600 --> 05:19.160]  The answer to 1984 is 1776, live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[05:19.160 --> 05:23.680]  Despite all the globalist efforts, thanks to you the viewers and listeners of this broadcast,
[05:23.680 --> 05:25.920]  we're still on air.
[05:25.920 --> 05:33.440]  Now we're only 37 hours from the incredibly historic official day of this midterm.
[05:33.440 --> 05:37.720]  We'll be here Tuesday, right through midnight, two o'clock, three o'clock, as long as we
[05:37.720 --> 05:40.360]  need to be here tracking this.
[05:40.360 --> 05:48.440]  The deep state has promised that they are going to manipulate things, of course, and
[05:48.440 --> 05:52.440]  are saying that in key battleground states, it'll stay open for days because they've got
[05:52.440 --> 05:56.280]  to count all the special ballots they've got rattled and ready to try to steal things
[05:56.280 --> 05:57.280]  like last time.
[05:57.280 --> 06:02.080]  But it's very hard for them to beat a massive red tsunami because they're using the names
[06:02.080 --> 06:05.800]  of dead people and folks that have moved out of the districts.
[06:05.800 --> 06:09.000]  But I'm going to get to that coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[06:09.000 --> 06:14.680]  There is a big report out, the big election watch state commission in Pennsylvania that
[06:14.680 --> 06:18.920]  has the database of who real voters are so they can find out what real votes are that
[06:18.920 --> 06:20.560]  was put in a few years ago.
[06:20.560 --> 06:26.680]  It just went offline and failed, and so they'll be able to try to carry out their fraud and
[06:26.680 --> 06:34.520]  prop up the creature, the ghoul, Federman, so we're going to be tracking all of that
[06:34.520 --> 06:35.520]  coming up.
[06:35.520 --> 06:43.720]  But I wanted first today to just really let something seek in here because if we don't
[06:43.720 --> 06:47.240]  understand this, we're not going to understand anything.
[06:47.240 --> 06:51.800]  There is a planetary world government being established, it's now out in the open.
[06:51.800 --> 06:55.040]  And if we can simply identify that this is happening and understand the tactics they're
[06:55.040 --> 07:02.000]  using, try to stop debate about it, the system will not be able to carry out its criminal
[07:02.000 --> 07:04.280]  activity.
[07:04.280 --> 07:07.920]  And I've harped on this and I've harped on this critical issue that we need to get good
[07:07.920 --> 07:12.760]  leaders around the world, which is starting to happen at an accelerated rate, to identify
[07:12.760 --> 07:18.200]  the new world order and the private corporate fascist model for the Debo group in the UN
[07:18.200 --> 07:23.360]  outlaw of the communist China so that the general population realizes the direct control
[07:23.360 --> 07:29.400]  they have over most governments and over policy to carry out these very hellish hellscape
[07:29.400 --> 07:32.880]  type operations.
[07:32.880 --> 07:37.160]  Now over the years, the deep state run by Obama and other globalists will do yearly
[07:37.160 --> 07:44.320]  polls and they'll ask the public what percentage of them think secret cabals run the government.
[07:44.320 --> 07:48.000]  These aren't secret cabals anymore, they're out in the open running things.
[07:48.000 --> 07:53.120]  Falshwab we penetrate, the cabinets we control, half the governments in the world, our agenda
[07:53.120 --> 07:58.400]  is here, we will take the property from you and control you, we own your body now, the
[07:58.400 --> 07:59.640]  future is not human.
[07:59.640 --> 08:06.840]  I mean, these are all real quotes, not just from him at this entire cult.
[08:06.840 --> 08:12.520]  And so there's a new poll out, Jamie White wrote about it at infowars.com, shock poll,
[08:12.520 --> 08:19.280]  nearly half of voters believe secret cabal controls the U.S. government, and who ran
[08:19.280 --> 08:21.280]  the poll?
[08:21.280 --> 08:25.520]  It's a poll of likely voters, half of U.S. voters believe the federal government is
[08:25.520 --> 08:28.360]  controlled by a secret cabal according to new poll.
[08:28.360 --> 08:35.080]  The Benison strategy group headed by Obama campaign pollster Joel Benenson surveyed 1000
[08:35.080 --> 08:41.960]  Americans between October 27th and 30th to see how much they were influenced by QAnon.
[08:41.960 --> 08:47.560]  They call anybody that questions the new world order world government QAnon because that's
[08:47.560 --> 08:52.360]  a nebulous group that puts out a lot of disinfo and some real info so they can act like only
[08:52.360 --> 08:55.360]  QAnon people are saying this.
[08:55.360 --> 08:59.720]  We wanted to test QAnon's language, the world's controlled by a secret cabal.
[08:59.720 --> 09:06.680]  So they're saying QAnon, not JFK question secret societies or not Ronald Reagan or not
[09:06.680 --> 09:12.120]  Alex Jones or not Ron Paul, or not the actual quotes these people know just say QAnon owns
[09:12.120 --> 09:17.800]  that real estate which is some nebulous group itself filled with globalist operatives.
[09:17.800 --> 09:22.480]  We wanted to test QAnon's language, the world's controlled by a secret cabal, he said, given
[09:22.480 --> 09:27.080]  that the U.S. is the world's strongest democracy, wanted to see how far the appeal of language
[09:27.080 --> 09:28.400]  like this might reach.
[09:28.400 --> 09:33.280]  As a result, 44% of respondents believe the U.S. government is controlled by a secret
[09:33.280 --> 09:35.280]  cabal.
[09:35.280 --> 09:37.960]  Now here's what's really important.
[09:37.960 --> 09:41.600]  Here's the actual poll, share of voters who say they think the federal government is
[09:41.600 --> 09:51.480]  controlled by a secret cabal, the total 44% by party, Republicans 53%, independent 41%,
[09:51.480 --> 09:56.600]  Democrat 37.
[09:56.600 --> 10:01.200]  So this is how this has worked, this is so important, listen to me carefully, that even
[10:01.200 --> 10:04.520]  more important issue will be covered in the next segment.
[10:04.520 --> 10:06.120]  This cannot get more important.
[10:06.120 --> 10:08.680]  Here's how the gaslighting works.
[10:08.680 --> 10:14.520]  For decades, if you look at UN treaties and open plans going back to the 60s to have the
[10:14.520 --> 10:19.480]  United Nations take over every major government's systems and basically establish a corporate
[10:19.480 --> 10:24.520]  world dictatorship, they would then have the New York Times, the Washington Post, ABC
[10:24.520 --> 10:30.200]  News, back on the Times, CBS News attack those people and say they were insane, it didn't
[10:30.200 --> 10:34.680]  exist, even though it was officially in the treaties and in the plans.
[10:34.680 --> 10:39.160]  Kind of like we have a 1979 weather control treaty, the Department of Energy admits since
[10:39.160 --> 10:43.280]  the early 90s they've been spraying aluminum dioxide, Miriam salts in the air to manipulate
[10:43.280 --> 10:44.280]  weather.
[10:44.280 --> 10:49.200]  When you talk about it, they just say you're crazy, even though it's on C-SPAN, it's CIA
[10:49.200 --> 10:52.640]  hearings, and it's in all the documents, the Department of Energy spends $5 billion a year
[10:52.640 --> 10:55.480]  on it, at least.
[10:55.480 --> 11:00.040]  They try to silence and shut down the voices that actually give you the details that's
[11:00.040 --> 11:02.640]  public, but they don't want to debate about it.
[11:02.640 --> 11:08.080]  So they go ahead with the agenda, just like human animal cloning across species been going
[11:08.080 --> 11:10.520]  on for at least 30 years, it's admitted.
[11:10.520 --> 11:13.640]  But I would talk about it 25 years ago, people say you're crazy, there aren't human animal
[11:13.640 --> 11:14.640]  clones.
[11:14.640 --> 11:17.160]  Now they come out in the news the last five years and go, yeah, we've been making human
[11:17.160 --> 11:21.040]  animal clones for a long time, we harvest the organs in medical experiments, we've got
[11:21.040 --> 11:23.920]  them in secret bases, but you're not allowed to see them.
[11:23.920 --> 11:29.000]  That's mainstream news now, see, because they didn't want to debate forming while they perfected
[11:29.000 --> 11:32.160]  whatever it is they're really up to.
[11:32.160 --> 11:34.240]  So it's the same tactic.
[11:34.240 --> 11:38.880]  You talk about world government run by corporate interest and you quote the UN and Klaus Schwab
[11:38.880 --> 11:44.280]  and Bill Gates, and the Financial Times of London a few years ago had a headline saying,
[11:44.280 --> 11:46.760]  yeah, world government's good, we're going to carry it out, and it's going to be authoritarian
[11:46.760 --> 11:49.280]  for your own good.
[11:49.280 --> 11:53.200]  Even the very same Financial Times of London, just one example, a week later ran a headline
[11:53.200 --> 11:57.440]  saying arrest anybody basically, or censor people that say there's a corporate one,
[11:57.440 --> 11:59.240]  world government being formed.
[11:59.240 --> 12:05.040]  So it's okay to promote world government, support world government, support the tyranny,
[12:05.040 --> 12:08.880]  support forced inoculation, but then when you criticize it, they go, whoa, whoa, whoa,
[12:08.880 --> 12:14.160]  there's no new world order, or there's no forced inoculation, or there's no inflation.
[12:14.160 --> 12:19.240]  We've now got a bunch of the different corporate mouthpieces will play the clips coming up.
[12:19.240 --> 12:21.920]  Saying there is no such thing as inflation.
[12:21.920 --> 12:26.640]  It's a word invented by Republicans to scare you.
[12:26.640 --> 12:31.200]  All inflation is, is prices exploding, the evaluation of currency.
[12:31.200 --> 12:34.680]  So that's the level of gaslighting here.
[12:34.680 --> 12:45.560]  But it was 5% of the colonies that initiated the Revolutionary War in 1775, 1776.
[12:45.560 --> 12:49.720]  And it was maybe 15, 20% won the war.
[12:49.720 --> 12:58.360]  If we've got 44% of Americans, even in Obama's own deep state poll, that know a shadow government
[12:58.360 --> 13:05.280]  runs things that's now emerging, taking the mask off, it's game over for these guys.
[13:05.280 --> 13:07.120]  That's a very important article by Jamie White.
[13:07.120 --> 13:11.040]  So good job, everybody, whether you're in Brazil or whether you're in Sweden or Germany
[13:11.040 --> 13:18.640]  or France or England or Russia or South Africa or Nigeria or Japan.
[13:18.640 --> 13:22.520]  The hottest thing is people discovering the WEF and the UN control their countries.
[13:22.520 --> 13:26.240]  And now it's all over the news that Twitter and Facebook and all of them were interfacing
[13:26.240 --> 13:31.320]  on a minute by minute basis with the UN and their censorship board on who to control working
[13:31.320 --> 13:35.240]  with the Democratic Party and the CIA and FBI illegally.
[13:35.240 --> 13:39.120]  Those documents came out a week and a half ago.
[13:39.120 --> 13:42.080]  That Twitter was under direct UN command.
[13:42.080 --> 13:49.080]  It's all coming out, ladies and gentlemen.
[13:49.080 --> 13:53.160]  And so once the people figure this out and that their pain and the inflation and the
[13:53.160 --> 13:59.480]  crime and the destruction is caused by the New World Order, it's game over.
[13:59.480 --> 14:06.840]  But they want to make it where it's a no-no, not kosher, from a side of nongrata, a scarlet
[14:06.840 --> 14:10.880]  letter if you talk about the globalist, the New World Order.
[14:10.880 --> 14:14.160]  So they're simultaneously announcing it, trying to mainline it and normalize you're under
[14:14.160 --> 14:18.560]  UN control with corporations running the planet ruthlessly for depopulation.
[14:18.560 --> 14:20.280]  You'll own nothing, you'll have nothing, you'll like it.
[14:20.280 --> 14:23.080]  Well, at the same time, when you talk about it, shut up, we're going to be platforming
[14:23.080 --> 14:25.440]  you and put you in jail because that doesn't exist.
[14:25.440 --> 14:29.600]  David Eich was about to give a speech in Amsterdam to 50,000 people.
[14:29.600 --> 14:32.120]  And David said you're at level three terrorist officially.
[14:32.120 --> 14:33.200]  You can't come to Europe.
[14:33.200 --> 14:36.080]  We'll arrest you because you say there's a secret government.
[14:36.080 --> 14:37.080]  Well, guess what?
[14:37.080 --> 14:40.280]  You already failed, you monsters, and you're going to go to prison.
[14:40.280 --> 14:41.720]  It's only a matter of time.
[14:41.720 --> 14:50.280]  Now the bigger news, the big news, the unbelievable genocide news, you'll want to stay with us
[14:50.280 --> 14:55.480]  until everybody you know tune in now.
[14:55.480 --> 15:01.080]  Welcome back to what they don't want you to know, despite the establishment's most wicked
[15:01.080 --> 15:07.320]  attempts, you're still here defiance to their tyranny, the grace of God, and your energy
[15:07.320 --> 15:11.920]  spreading the word about infowars.com and Band-Aid video in our local stations across
[15:11.920 --> 15:14.000]  the United States.
[15:14.000 --> 15:15.000]  You are the resistance.
[15:15.000 --> 15:19.000]  You are the strength of this operation, viewers and listeners, don't forget that ever.
[15:19.000 --> 15:22.800]  The children are counting on you and our entire future is in your hands.
[15:22.800 --> 15:27.200]  All right, look, we've known this for about a year and a half since the deadly injection
[15:27.200 --> 15:35.840]  started almost two years because in the fine print, the CDC said in October of 2000, they'd
[15:35.840 --> 15:41.280]  already secretly tested these mRNA shots before and that's now come out on other COVID category
[15:41.280 --> 15:45.960]  diseases on humans and animals that was going to cause myocarditis, heart attacks, blood
[15:45.960 --> 15:51.640]  clots, infertility, stillbirths, spontaneous abortions, the list goes on and on.
[15:51.640 --> 15:59.080]  And so now there's a big article up on infowars.com tonight by the intrepid and prolific Jamie
[15:59.080 --> 16:10.680]  White that links directly to the German government, the Swedish government, and the United States
[16:10.680 --> 16:14.480]  government.
[16:14.480 --> 16:20.640]  Now remember what came out a year ago in the New England Journal of Medicine in the first
[16:20.640 --> 16:30.800]  and second trimester, more than 10,000 pregnant women they tracked in the study, 82% had miscarriages
[16:30.800 --> 16:38.920]  when usually about 3% of women have miscarriages in the first and second trimesters.
[16:38.920 --> 16:43.440]  So they're only counting it as stillbirths in the third trimester, so remember that number
[16:43.440 --> 16:44.840]  is much higher.
[16:44.840 --> 16:53.360]  It was a little under 15% of the women having the miscarriages in the third trimester.
[16:53.360 --> 16:57.720]  This is very tailored to going to the radar.
[16:57.720 --> 17:00.440]  It kills 82% of the babies.
[17:00.440 --> 17:02.960]  Remember there's too many of us, the same people that want us to take the shots and
[17:02.960 --> 17:07.560]  say they love us, tells us there's too many of us, they want to get rid of us.
[17:07.560 --> 17:10.680]  And they're hitting who they see is using the most resources, the Western worlds where
[17:10.680 --> 17:15.000]  they hit us with the Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, and J&J, they all do the same thing.
[17:15.000 --> 17:23.400]  They create folding protein systems similar to spongiform encephalopathy or what causes
[17:23.400 --> 17:28.400]  mad cow disease, spongiform encephalopathy, prions, and I had Dr. Peter McCullough in
[17:28.400 --> 17:31.680]  the studio for two hours yesterday, that's now an archived video, he talked a lot about
[17:31.680 --> 17:34.120]  that and we show the studies.
[17:34.120 --> 17:40.920]  So it colonizes your body, it migrates to areas that have a lot of cellular change going
[17:40.920 --> 17:47.360]  on, like the ovaries, like the testicles, like the breast, those are the most hormonal
[17:47.360 --> 17:52.640]  areas of the body, they go to the most interchange with the platelets of the body, but even
[17:52.640 --> 17:59.480]  separate with platelets being in the area, the so-called vaccine creates a nanotech formation
[17:59.480 --> 18:10.680]  in your body of self-replicating folding nanotech prion crystals, and that's what coroners and
[18:10.680 --> 18:14.400]  pathologists reporting everywhere that they've given the shots, where they don't take these
[18:14.400 --> 18:20.360]  shots in China and Russia, many of the hundreds of other countries, they have no problem.
[18:20.360 --> 18:26.360]  Everywhere they do take the shots, where the Pentagon through Bill and Melinda Gates gave
[18:26.360 --> 18:32.240]  the directives in the years before the release of COVID to develop these exact same plans,
[18:32.240 --> 18:39.480]  viral vector vaccines, and mRNA, gene therapy, so-called vaccines.
[18:39.480 --> 18:44.360]  So it's all to order, directed by the UN and the Pentagon, and even Dr. McCullough broke
[18:44.360 --> 18:47.120]  this down in an article about it, we'll be getting to.
[18:47.120 --> 18:50.840]  I think the troops are on your side, the average person, the military is a great person, but
[18:50.840 --> 18:53.680]  the people that run our military are the globalist.
[18:53.680 --> 19:01.400]  This is a world government, UN, Pentagon-directed operation, and so the German government looks
[19:01.400 --> 19:08.480]  at the last hundred plus years of statistics, and this is a higher stillbirth and death-rated
[19:08.480 --> 19:17.160]  children than when five million Russian troops were invading Germany in 1945.
[19:17.160 --> 19:24.200]  Now, to put that in perspective, the Russians killed 20 million Germans in World War II,
[19:24.200 --> 19:30.000]  that's a third of the population, look it up, the Germans killed 22 million Russians
[19:30.000 --> 19:36.440]  conservatively, about a third of them or 25% of them, but side issues, sorry, so this is
[19:36.440 --> 19:40.280]  bigger than World War II for our children.
[19:40.280 --> 19:44.640]  COVID vaccines linked to plummeting fertility rate, German study finds an alarming study
[19:44.640 --> 19:49.280]  of the German and he reveals a strong association between the COVID-19 vaccine rollout and the
[19:49.280 --> 19:53.840]  sudden dramatic drop in fertility rates in Germany and Sweden and stillbirths, according
[19:53.840 --> 19:59.040]  to the German Federal Institute for Population Research, there is a strong association between
[19:59.040 --> 20:04.800]  the onset of vaccination programs and the fertility decline nine months after it says
[20:04.800 --> 20:10.840]  this is not connected to COVID and not connected to anything in the economy, it is the shot
[20:10.840 --> 20:12.920]  they found is the causal effect.
[20:12.920 --> 20:20.760]  You might want to actually look at those statistics, here is Germany, it's very interesting, we've
[20:20.760 --> 20:30.840]  got Sweden, Sweden right here, had basically the same rollout as Germany and they have
[20:30.840 --> 20:34.720]  almost the exact same graph.
[20:34.720 --> 20:45.000]  So here you see 2000, 2002, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12 and it goes back 100 years and then boom,
[20:45.000 --> 20:55.080]  the injections begin at the end of 2020 and looky there what happens, the exact same basic
[20:55.080 --> 21:06.280]  graph in Sweden and in Germany and then as soon as people get smart out of the first
[21:06.280 --> 21:13.360]  year and stop taking it, it reverses itself but not back to the levels it was, only goes
[21:13.360 --> 21:23.400]  back up a third of where it was, now let me show you the stillbirth logs, they're exactly
[21:23.400 --> 21:24.400]  the same.
[21:24.400 --> 21:32.120]  Well, but that's just Sweden, that's just Germany, oh, we have the VAERS reporting system
[21:32.120 --> 21:37.760]  here in the United States and here's what it shows for miscarriages of stillbirths,
[21:37.760 --> 21:55.400]  look at all these years, this one goes back to 1990, 32 years ago and it is 3,500 plus
[21:55.400 --> 22:03.640]  percent, I guess that's 3, that's 36, 3,700 times, excuse me, that's 36 and a half, so
[22:03.640 --> 22:12.000]  3,650 percent increase exactly at the start of 2021 when the shots start in the United
[22:12.000 --> 22:24.240]  States, exactly a 3,600 plus percent increase in miscarriages and stillbirths.
[22:24.240 --> 22:30.600]  People get wise, the poison shot uptake dramatically drops but still those people are pretty much
[22:30.600 --> 22:39.440]  permanently disabled and probably will never be able to have children but now some of the
[22:39.440 --> 22:44.840]  folks start having children again and it bounces back about a third, a little less than a little
[22:44.840 --> 22:56.880]  more than a third, just like Germany and Sweden, the exact same graph, so guess what I've got
[22:56.880 --> 23:05.400]  Australia to, oh, and I've got New Zealand and I've got the UK and guess what, they're
[23:05.400 --> 23:10.640]  even worse because they took it up at a higher level, they were good little citizens and
[23:10.640 --> 23:14.760]  after all the publics that done them believes murdering criminals like this, should they
[23:14.760 --> 23:20.440]  really be having children, you know I'm starting to like Bill Gates, it's the left that did
[23:20.440 --> 23:23.200]  all this and they're not going to be having children, see I'm not evil so I don't agree
[23:23.200 --> 23:28.160]  with that but I mean they do like to be murdered, they do like to have their children die and
[23:28.160 --> 23:36.520]  don't worry, they're going to, oh, it's so liberal, we'll be right back.
[23:36.520 --> 23:43.440]  Please don't forget we're going to have live coverage kicking off Tuesday morning at 8am
[23:43.440 --> 23:48.680]  right through past midnight, these incredibly important midterms and all the obvious chicanery
[23:48.680 --> 24:03.160]  that has already begun there, now let's go ahead and get back into what I was just covering,
[24:03.160 --> 24:08.040]  you can say hey it's the leftists that are taking these poison shots, so who cares if
[24:08.040 --> 24:10.680]  they all kill themselves, well I actually morally do because most of them aren't that
[24:10.680 --> 24:15.280]  evil, they're just misled, plus they're going after the children, no country's going after
[24:15.280 --> 24:20.640]  children like the United States hijacked by the New World Order, six month olds and up,
[24:20.640 --> 24:25.760]  the FDA and federal government's trying to make it mandatory in schools so they're coming
[24:25.760 --> 24:30.600]  after our children, our children cannot make these conscious decisions, they can't join
[24:30.600 --> 24:35.840]  the military, they can't buy a pack of cigarettes, they can't buy a bottle of liquor and they
[24:35.840 --> 24:41.480]  shouldn't be able to take these poison shots, if their evil parents want to take it they
[24:41.480 --> 24:46.880]  should take it and it's definitely a cult thing with them to prove that they're part
[24:46.880 --> 24:50.760]  of the system but if you just joined us, Sweden and Germany have basically the exact same
[24:50.760 --> 24:56.160]  numbers with the US and you can follow the higher the rate of taking the shots, the higher
[24:56.160 --> 25:02.760]  the rate of miscarriages and stillbirth, same thing with Israel, it all starts right when
[25:02.760 --> 25:07.400]  the countries start the injections, England started the shots first in late 2020 so it
[25:07.400 --> 25:12.440]  started there first, everywhere else it started in 2021 and you see the numbers explode after
[25:12.440 --> 25:22.440]  that, pretty shocking information, now that leads us to this next big point, we have an
[25:22.440 --> 25:27.480]  info wars dot com poll in the middle of the right hand side of the page, are you willing
[25:27.480 --> 25:33.880]  to forgive the establishment for forcing COVID-19 upon you for two years, 2% have Stockholm
[25:33.880 --> 25:50.720]  syndrome and said yes, no was 31%, that was some day and we have no Nuremberg 2.0 trials
[25:50.720 --> 26:01.920]  66%, so let me read that again, yes said 2%, no was 31, so yes 2% said they'll forgive
[26:01.920 --> 26:12.520]  the system, no was 31%, some day was 1% and no Nuremberg war crime trials 2.0, 66% and
[26:12.520 --> 26:20.320]  that really should be 100% ladies and gentlemen, so that leads me now to this story that's
[26:20.320 --> 26:24.200]  been out for a week and a half, it's been so huge, it's really got people's attention
[26:24.200 --> 26:28.160]  and got them thinking and angry, the Atlantic came out which is the mouthpiece of the New
[26:28.160 --> 26:33.560]  World Order and said okay, we made some mistakes, we're sorry, the shot doesn't work but we
[26:33.560 --> 26:37.200]  still want to make you take it and we locked you down on our kids and the masks don't work
[26:37.200 --> 26:42.480]  and we want an amnesty, just forgive us because they see the political worldwide movement
[26:42.480 --> 26:45.720]  that's built, it's not going away, we're not forgiving, we're not forgetting, they're
[26:45.720 --> 26:53.280]  going to go to prison for this, Nuremberg 2.0, they can see what's building against them
[26:53.280 --> 27:02.880]  and totally backfired and so they're saying give them amnesty but meanwhile, COVID vaccination
[27:02.880 --> 27:09.760]  proof still required to enter America in 2023, the only country doing it, so there is no
[27:09.760 --> 27:16.520]  amnesty for people coming to the US or people leaving and coming, no, they're still coming
[27:16.520 --> 27:22.680]  after us, they're giving us no amnesty from their tyranny, they're coming after us now
[27:22.680 --> 27:27.400]  more than ever and targeting the doctors and scientists who were right, who were vindicated
[27:27.400 --> 27:31.720]  like Sherry Tenpenny, I'm on her show for two hours tomorrow morning and Dr. Peter McCullough
[27:31.720 --> 27:35.320]  and countless others are targeting trying to strip their license and not even saying
[27:35.320 --> 27:45.120]  why, very important article about Dr. Peter McCullough on America Out Loud, why COVID-19
[27:45.120 --> 27:49.800]  mass vaccination is a military operation, I'm going to have this article posted right
[27:49.800 --> 27:56.640]  now on infowars.com, he actually worked for this government agency, he's run programs
[27:56.640 --> 28:02.280]  for them and he exposes that it's mad scientists at the top of the Pentagon running the worldwide
[28:02.280 --> 28:07.120]  program and that they're the ones creating weaponized versions of COVID that kill the
[28:07.120 --> 28:11.800]  vast majority, over 80% of those that come in contact with the ones, they've gotten the
[28:11.800 --> 28:16.600]  Boston lab and others, there's that famous meme of the woman mad at the cat at the table,
[28:16.600 --> 28:22.280]  they've changed it to say what America needs right now is COVID amnesty, the cat says
[28:22.280 --> 28:30.760]  it's pronounced tribunal, so there you go and China of course is bringing back all its
[28:30.760 --> 28:37.880]  big lockdowns that ever even went away, they're building COVID facilities all over the world
[28:37.880 --> 28:45.600]  under UN regulations and directives to lock us up during the next big power grab, but
[28:45.600 --> 28:50.440]  what an important article, COVID vaccines linked to plummeting fertility rate, German
[28:50.440 --> 28:57.640]  study finds, that's a powerful headline, but if we put the full show headline up there,
[28:57.640 --> 29:08.920]  it tells it all, Germany, Sweden and the US have basically the exact same numbers, a 3,600%
[29:08.920 --> 29:17.720]  increase in stillbirths and miscarriages of those that took the shots, they directly
[29:17.720 --> 29:24.040]  in the study show it's people taking the deadly shots and if you look at the US numbers it
[29:24.040 --> 29:29.440]  follows the same number and it actually matches up almost identically with the New England
[29:29.440 --> 29:36.280]  Journal of Medicine study a year ago of an 82% increase in miscarriages in the first
[29:36.280 --> 29:42.560]  and second trimester and a massive increase in stillbirths after that, that's over a 3,000%
[29:42.560 --> 29:48.280]  increase as well, so study after study after study by the German government, by the US
[29:48.280 --> 29:55.560]  government, by the Swedish government, now what about Israel, they forced more shots
[29:55.560 --> 29:59.880]  than anybody on their public, now they got even higher numbers and after them the next
[29:59.880 --> 30:06.320]  is Australia, New Zealand where they hold you as prisoners until they force all the
[30:06.320 --> 30:14.120]  shots they want on you, it is absolutely outrageous and how were they able to carry all of this
[30:14.120 --> 30:19.720]  out, well we've been covering this for a week and a half now, first broken the intercept
[30:19.720 --> 30:24.880]  confirming everything we'd already told you, we had lots of other documents, but that under
[30:24.880 --> 30:28.560]  Obama and then secretly under Trump, he didn't run it, they were targeting him the documents
[30:28.560 --> 30:35.920]  say, his own quote, executive branch, the bureaucrats, the permanent deep state and
[30:35.920 --> 30:42.720]  accelerating under the third administration of Obama, Biden, under the third administration
[30:42.720 --> 30:48.920]  of Obama, they come right out in the open with the UN and the ADL, the Southern Prairie
[30:48.920 --> 30:54.560]  Law Center, all interfacing with the federal government, the DHS, on who to censor and
[30:54.560 --> 31:03.160]  who to surveil and who to debank, that's them meeting with the big banks, absolutely criminal.
[31:03.160 --> 31:09.520]  So Rand Paul, there's a video, it's on infowars.com, on Fox News, Vow's Internet is Bill, to stop
[31:09.520 --> 31:14.320]  government and big tech colluding to censor speech, well they're surveilling you and they're
[31:14.320 --> 31:19.120]  engaged in racketeering, there's already laws against it, okay sure, pass another one, remember
[31:19.120 --> 31:22.200]  they had that disinformation board they were sending out, well it turns out it was already
[31:22.200 --> 31:26.920]  set up secretly operating, the Disinformation Governance Board, paying direct orders from
[31:26.920 --> 31:34.200]  Biden, the DHS and the UN, but guess who the document says, writes the rules that the UN
[31:34.200 --> 31:40.280]  then gives the orders to implement, the consortium of think tanks led by the Anti-Defamation
[31:40.280 --> 31:51.720]  League of the Nye Breath, don't believe me, let's go research the
[31:51.720 --> 31:55.440]  Disinformation Governance Board, but if you go to Google they'll misdirect you to the
[31:55.440 --> 32:00.440]  ADL saying nothing exists, it's not real, but you can actually go to the federal court
[32:00.440 --> 32:04.440]  documents and all the rest, if you search on Duck Duck Go or even Bing I'll let you
[32:04.440 --> 32:09.880]  find it, but Google is totally controlled and you cannot get the information that Senator
[32:09.880 --> 32:16.560]  Rand Paul is talking about, they even censor and block him because it's an enemy operation,
[32:16.560 --> 32:20.160]  total takeover of the United States.
[32:20.160 --> 32:23.960]  So when we come back ahead of a special guest in the next hour, I want to just play a few
[32:23.960 --> 32:28.800]  of the clips in Australia and Europe and the United States and Canada where they were all
[32:28.800 --> 32:32.160]  lockstep following the same talking points, that those that didn't take the shots were
[32:32.160 --> 32:35.920]  going to make everybody sick and that the shots worked 100% of the time and that we
[32:35.920 --> 32:40.800]  were terrorists, we were criminals, we were racist, we were bad.
[32:40.800 --> 32:44.960]  Why David Ike's been listed by the EU as a tight level three terrorist, level three
[32:44.960 --> 32:49.680]  terrorist had the official EU document banned from Europe because he questions the shots
[32:49.680 --> 32:53.960]  and he says there's secret cabals running the government, not allowed to say that and
[32:53.960 --> 32:57.440]  the secret cabal will ban you if you do.
[32:57.440 --> 33:09.760]  The globalists are losing folks, humanity's winning.
[33:09.760 --> 33:13.600]  Let it sink in that they're actually murdering us, very groups that tell us there's too
[33:13.600 --> 33:18.600]  many of us all there, they want to depopulate us, now the 500 million Bill Gates, Klaus Schwab
[33:18.600 --> 33:25.400]  all of them, they're really doing it, Ted Turner, the whole sync group and think about
[33:25.400 --> 33:33.000]  the miscarriages up 3,600 plus percent in the western world of even higher places like
[33:33.000 --> 33:37.120]  Israel and Australia where they have even higher poison injection rates, it follows
[33:37.120 --> 33:38.120]  it exactly.
[33:38.120 --> 33:43.520]  I just showed you hard government data and findings by the German government that it's
[33:43.520 --> 33:50.320]  the shot, the government just told by the UN what to do and they implemented it and
[33:50.320 --> 33:58.560]  the UN's told what to do by the big corporations and the Pentagon, so it hits its own troops
[33:58.560 --> 34:02.320]  with a deadly shot, it's an attack on all of us, they got to hit us all so there's even
[34:02.320 --> 34:06.080]  death rates everywhere, we don't notice exactly what they're doing, but they got to hit the
[34:06.080 --> 34:12.360]  kids too, but here is British member of parliament Andrew Bridge calls for investigation into
[34:12.360 --> 34:18.760]  excess deaths in their relationship to the jabs, 18 to 40 percent increase in death across
[34:18.760 --> 34:24.440]  the board, myocarditis, heart attacks, huge, weird, synthetic blood clots, all confirmed,
[34:24.440 --> 34:32.080]  they're growing protein crystals in you, it's mad cow, weaponized mad cow spike protein,
[34:32.080 --> 34:38.320]  now I had Peter McCullough top scientist on your stage affirming that, it's all in the
[34:38.320 --> 34:40.960]  studies, this is really going on.
[34:40.960 --> 34:49.920]  Now, it's got to stay cool, 87 degrees or lower, that's why a lot of places, lazy folks
[34:49.920 --> 34:55.120]  let it get too hot so it didn't hurt as many people as it would have, that's confirmed,
[34:55.120 --> 34:59.480]  and it needs to be injected directly in the body, preferably repeatedly to take hold to
[34:59.480 --> 35:05.480]  grow the colonies, that's why they want repeated boosters, so it's not obvious right up front
[35:05.480 --> 35:12.160]  they begin to colonize, and then the more the protein is the more it can grow, so let's
[35:12.160 --> 35:18.640]  go ahead now and play, there's dozens of these clubs all over the world, EU, you name it,
[35:18.640 --> 35:22.000]  everybody coming out recognizing they've been murdered, so the good news is murderers, we
[35:22.000 --> 35:25.960]  know you did it, we're going to get you, you're going to be exposed, you're murdering beyond
[35:25.960 --> 35:33.160]  Nazis 2.0, Satanist, here it is, I wish I had longer to speak, finally the excess deaths
[35:33.160 --> 35:39.760]  we're suffering at the moment in this country across Europe and in the Americas, what analysis
[35:39.760 --> 35:45.640]  is the government making of these excess deaths, but even a casual glance at the data shows
[35:45.640 --> 35:51.440]  that there's a very strong correlation between vaccine uptake and the level of excess deaths
[35:51.440 --> 35:56.520]  being found in that country, surely we must have an investigation, these are tens of thousands
[35:56.520 --> 36:01.120]  of people who are dying more than we're expected, it's really, really important, and I think
[36:01.120 --> 36:04.960]  if we don't get this right, no one's going to believe we're going to lose trust in politicians
[36:04.960 --> 36:10.240]  and we're going to lose trust in our medicine and our medical system, thank you very much.
[36:10.240 --> 36:15.680]  Which was the plan as I told you three years ago to collapse everything, it's all planned
[36:15.680 --> 36:19.280]  but they think they won't get the blame, they think our governments will, our governments
[36:19.280 --> 36:24.120]  are their stuges, we need our governments to arrest the globalist, we must take control
[36:24.120 --> 36:29.960]  of them, we're about to in 35 hours if we can, now let's play a bunch of back to back,
[36:29.960 --> 36:33.640]  I've got hours of this but we'll just play 7, 8, 9, 10 minutes until we go to the break,
[36:33.640 --> 36:39.440]  come back with more, here is the system, bullying people here, France, Europe, Australia, you
[36:39.440 --> 36:42.920]  name it, Macron's in France so we won't play it, it says we have, we're going to make your
[36:42.920 --> 36:46.680]  life healthy, take the shots, including your children, you'll never stop us, we're going
[36:46.680 --> 36:53.720]  to break you, just go ahead and play a smattering of these back to back, yeah it turns out that
[36:53.720 --> 36:58.440]  this was all a lie, yep, I was really just kind of hoping we could put all this behind
[36:58.440 --> 37:03.360]  us and move on, is that like, is that an apology because it doesn't really sound like one,
[37:03.360 --> 37:07.680]  I know that I called you a grandma killer but I really just wanted what was best for
[37:07.680 --> 37:11.640]  you, I actually couldn't visit my grandma in the hospital or even attend her funeral
[37:11.640 --> 37:17.160]  but my heart was in the right place, I also lost my business and my job, I had good intentions
[37:17.160 --> 37:22.880]  and my kids' social, mental and physical development was also hurt, listen we just didn't know,
[37:22.880 --> 37:26.960]  I knew, lots of people knew but you refused to listen, instead you called us names and
[37:26.960 --> 37:32.520]  wished death upon us, let's just call a truce okay, but according to your hat you care about
[37:32.520 --> 37:37.240]  social justice, what does that have to do with anything, why don't you care about justice
[37:37.240 --> 37:41.720]  here, I don't hear you demanding apologies or reparations, because that would have to
[37:41.720 --> 37:48.480]  come from me and we just need to move on, so you don't believe in accountability for systemic
[37:48.480 --> 37:53.840]  injustices when you're the one guilty, can't we just build back and move forward and I
[37:53.840 --> 37:58.480]  want to build back a system that allowed this to occur, don't you want peace, I found this
[37:58.480 --> 38:05.200]  sign on the ground maybe you recognize it.
[38:05.200 --> 38:09.560]  We have to start doing things for the greater good of society and not for idiots who think
[38:09.560 --> 38:14.400]  that they can do their own research or that they are above the law and they can break
[38:14.400 --> 38:22.120]  the rules, Australia, Novak Djokovic, Australia said no no no, we're going to look at the
[38:22.120 --> 38:25.400]  greater good of everyone in our society and you're not part of it.
[38:25.400 --> 38:32.240]  And people have also heard these are new vaccines and they've been done quicker than usually
[38:32.240 --> 38:37.360]  takes years and years and years to approve a vaccine, well the reason it was able to
[38:37.360 --> 38:46.080]  be done quicker is because we threw more money and more people to do the work than ever had
[38:46.080 --> 38:50.520]  been done before to get a vaccine because it was so important to get it run, there wasn't
[38:50.520 --> 38:57.400]  any shortcuts taken, there weren't any steps skipped, the full approval was done, it was
[38:57.400 --> 39:02.480]  just done with a lot more people and a lot more attention on it than ever before.
[39:02.480 --> 39:08.600]  So that's how you can know that vaccines absolutely are safe.
[39:08.600 --> 39:14.000]  Lord knows what happened if he didn't partake but back then anyone who refused to get vaccinated
[39:14.000 --> 39:18.640]  would get ratted out immediately because we knew that person could hurt other people.
[39:18.640 --> 39:22.080]  The common wheel was a common wheel.
[39:22.080 --> 39:25.800]  Now we're engaged in a similar struggle with COVID and Eisenhower would be aghast.
[39:25.800 --> 39:30.960]  We have immuno-compromised people who are incubators for every variant to come walking
[39:30.960 --> 39:35.200]  around lawfully unvaccinated, that's psychotic.
[39:35.200 --> 39:38.760]  We have companies that have tried hard to get people vaccinated and now backing down.
[39:38.760 --> 39:41.960]  We have governors who want to be president by grandstanding on a foolish state's right
[39:41.960 --> 39:45.440]  issue, the right to get sick and get other people sick.
[39:45.440 --> 39:48.760]  So it's time to admit that we have to go to war against COVID.
[39:48.760 --> 39:51.480]  Require vaccination universally, have the military brought it.
[39:51.480 --> 39:56.320]  If you don't want to get vaccinated, you better be ready to prove your conscience, just object
[39:56.320 --> 40:00.800]  your status in court and even then you need to help in the war effort by staying home
[40:00.800 --> 40:03.280]  until we finally beat this thing.
[40:03.280 --> 40:09.160]  Many of us are frustrated with the nearly 80 million Americans who are still not vaccinated
[40:09.160 --> 40:14.040]  even though the vaccine is safe, effective and free.
[40:14.040 --> 40:19.600]  Nobody will be safe if not everybody is vaccinated.
[40:19.600 --> 40:25.000]  Young people, you are championing an open internet and a two trillion digital access
[40:25.000 --> 40:31.880]  plan to bring the world online and prevent internet shutdown and you are presenting
[40:31.880 --> 40:41.200]  new ways to minimize the spread of misinformation and you want to combat dangerous extremist
[40:41.200 --> 40:43.240]  views in the internet.
[40:43.240 --> 40:48.440]  For us to simply go back to some kind of normal, but to be honest, normal was the problem and
[40:48.440 --> 40:54.080]  today we have a very rare and narrow opportunity for us to build back better and leave that
[40:54.080 --> 40:55.280]  all known behind.
[40:55.280 --> 41:00.920]  Let me be very, very clear, nothing is off the table, any and every idea at this stage
[41:00.920 --> 41:01.920]  is worth considering.
[41:01.920 --> 41:06.440]  Speaking the truth, you have to have leaders, the data will help be more, yeah, of course
[41:06.440 --> 41:11.000]  I said that is true, but also, I mean, in addition to, you've got to have people start
[41:11.000 --> 41:12.000]  speaking the truth.
[41:12.000 --> 41:14.880]  You can't have them speaking out of both sides of their mouths saying, you know, I trust
[41:14.880 --> 41:18.680]  the science and I'm doing this, I heard you had Jerome Adams on and he's saying, talking
[41:18.680 --> 41:24.440]  about some bright wing conservative propaganda hosts who are saying, oh yeah, no one really
[41:24.440 --> 41:25.440]  said get vaccine.
[41:25.440 --> 41:28.680]  They said, I believe in the science and it's up to you to get it.
[41:28.680 --> 41:31.120]  We can't have mealy mouth people like that.
[41:31.120 --> 41:37.800]  You have to be more direct, a more concerted effort to say get vaccinated because you're
[41:37.800 --> 41:41.560]  not just killing yourself, you're going to kill other people.
[41:41.560 --> 41:43.160]  That's what you have to start telling people.
[41:43.160 --> 41:47.200]  You got to start telling people if you don't get vaccinated, you can't come into this office
[41:47.200 --> 41:48.720]  or this place of business.
[41:48.720 --> 41:51.440]  If you don't get vaccinated, you can't come to work.
[41:51.440 --> 41:54.480]  If you don't get vaccinated, you can't come into this gym.
[41:54.480 --> 41:59.000]  If you don't get vaccinated, you can't come into this, get onto this airplane.
[41:59.000 --> 42:02.360]  It has nothing to do with freedom.
[42:02.360 --> 42:03.880]  There's nothing new with liberty.
[42:03.880 --> 42:08.520]  You don't have the freedom and the liberty to put other people in jeopardy.
[42:08.520 --> 42:09.520]  You don't have that.
[42:09.520 --> 42:12.060]  You have to drive the speed limit.
[42:12.060 --> 42:14.040]  You have to obey the rules.
[42:14.040 --> 42:17.160]  Put some rules in place that will demand that people get vaccinated.
[42:17.160 --> 42:21.560]  The rules like you can't mandate an experimental shot.
[42:21.560 --> 42:24.440]  Rules like you guys said it worked when it didn't and you knew it didn't.
[42:24.440 --> 42:28.240]  Rules like you said it had been tested and all been approved when it wasn't.
[42:28.240 --> 42:31.200]  We're going to go to break and start the next hour.
[42:31.200 --> 42:32.200]  We're going to get into the election.
[42:32.200 --> 42:33.200]  We're going to get into evidence.
[42:33.200 --> 42:36.720]  They're going to try to steal it big time and so much more.
[42:36.720 --> 42:40.840]  Laura Loomer is going to be popping in then Sunday live tonight.
[42:40.840 --> 42:44.560]  I interviewed Dr. Peter McCullough for two-plus hours yesterday in studio.
[42:44.560 --> 42:51.520]  We're going to re-air that to our radio stations out there coming up today in the third and
[42:51.520 --> 42:54.920]  fourth hour of the Sunday Live We Expanded Weekend broadcast.
[42:54.920 --> 42:58.840]  We're attending soon to start live shows on the weekend and some at night.
[42:58.840 --> 43:03.360]  I'm going to leave it at that, but a lot of stuff has been gearing up around here.
[43:03.360 --> 43:07.160]  Please remember we have Black Friday sale comes earlier, biggest sale of the year just
[43:07.160 --> 43:10.480]  builds towards Christmas, but this is as big as the sales get.
[43:10.480 --> 43:13.800]  It'll continue to Christmas, but we'll sell out a lot of stuff, but almost all the products
[43:13.800 --> 43:15.400]  are still in stock right now.
[43:15.400 --> 43:22.800]  X2, X3, Vitamin Mineral Fusion, DNA Force Plus, up to 60% off at infowarsshore.com with
[43:22.800 --> 43:23.800]  promo code 1776.
[43:23.800 --> 43:30.800]  We're doing God's work, hour number two coming up.
[43:30.800 --> 43:37.680]  All right, Laura Lommer's coming up.
[43:37.680 --> 43:43.440]  She's heavily involved, battling the globalists with national ads she put out that are going
[43:43.440 --> 43:44.440]  mega viral.
[43:44.440 --> 43:48.720]  Saw her on the war room with Steve Bannon, wanted to get her on.
[43:48.720 --> 43:53.200]  She'll be doing some election night coverage with us along with Roger Stone, Steve Bannon,
[43:53.200 --> 43:54.200]  and so many others.
[43:54.200 --> 43:58.640]  Robert Barnes, Tuesday night into the morning, Olly Alexander and more.
[43:58.640 --> 44:04.920]  But coming up, breaking out outage in PA voter database, an election day nears.
[44:04.920 --> 44:08.080]  The database put in a few years ago to make sure only voters could vote, magically has
[44:08.080 --> 44:12.000]  failed, and they say it won't be there to make sure Federman doesn't cheat.
[44:12.000 --> 44:18.520]  We'll be covering that coming up, ladies and gentlemen, with a whole other stack of key,
[44:18.520 --> 44:25.320]  several big stacks of key election news with Laura Lommer and more throughout this hour.
[44:25.320 --> 44:31.440]  And then as I said, Dr. Peter McCullough will be in our three and four tonight, his most
[44:31.440 --> 44:37.120]  powerful interview ever, where he takes the gloves off big time and says, yes, it's an
[44:37.120 --> 44:39.600]  inside the population plan, mass murder.
[44:39.600 --> 44:40.600]  He's known it for years.
[44:40.600 --> 44:42.400]  We've had private conversations.
[44:42.400 --> 44:52.440]  But here is the latest report on the theft going on in Brazil.
[44:52.440 --> 44:58.720]  Before his first election, the radical opposition attempted to assassinate Jair Bolsonaro.
[44:58.720 --> 45:03.640]  Jair Bolsonaro has been left in a serious but stable condition in hospital.
[45:03.640 --> 45:08.680]  This after being stabbed while drumming up support ahead of next month's vote.
[45:08.680 --> 45:12.000]  Hospital officials say it could take two months for him to recover.
[45:12.000 --> 45:18.240]  They failed, and President Bolsonaro went on to become today's leading model of what
[45:18.240 --> 45:20.200]  a world leader should be.
[45:20.200 --> 45:22.000]  A man of the people.
[45:22.000 --> 45:27.040]  He spoke out against the COVID pandemic hoax from the very beginning.
[45:27.040 --> 45:32.240]  Brazil's right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro said he will not take a coronavirus vaccine,
[45:32.240 --> 45:34.240]  calling it his quote, right.
[45:34.240 --> 45:39.560]  He made statements live on social media Thursday, adding that Congress was not likely to require
[45:39.560 --> 45:41.320]  Brazilians to take a vaccine.
[45:41.320 --> 45:45.600]  He thanked the farmers of Brazil for not shutting down.
[45:45.600 --> 46:15.160]  And declared every single Brazilian as being essential, and now the world is realizing that
[46:15.160 --> 46:17.160]  Bolsonaro was right.
[46:17.160 --> 46:41.600]  No matter how much the media tries to smear him, the people of Brazil love him.
[46:41.600 --> 46:47.640]  The awakening masses in Brazil, like everywhere else in the world today, were expecting election
[46:47.640 --> 46:48.640]  fraud.
[46:48.640 --> 46:56.360]  Pols show Bolsonaro still trailing behind left-wing former leader, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
[46:56.360 --> 46:57.360]  Pols are lying.
[46:57.360 --> 46:59.760]  If Lula is really the front-runner, where is he?
[46:59.760 --> 47:00.920]  Where are his crowds?
[47:00.920 --> 47:04.080]  We are here to show that Bolsonaro represents the majority.
[47:04.080 --> 47:09.040]  He will only lose the election if there is fraud, and the people will take to the streets
[47:09.040 --> 47:10.320]  to stop that from happening.
[47:10.320 --> 47:12.360]  They have taken to the streets.
[47:12.360 --> 47:18.240]  All over Brazil, the people are not willing to go the way of Joe Obama, the way of the
[47:18.240 --> 47:20.600]  world economic forum.
[47:20.600 --> 47:24.200]  What will it take for the people to be represented?
[47:24.200 --> 47:29.480]  And what will America do if the anticipated red wave is stolen?
[47:29.480 --> 47:33.880]  The president's office may have conceded a defeat, but many of Jair Bolsonaro's millions
[47:33.880 --> 47:36.840]  of supporters have not.
[47:36.840 --> 47:41.720]  They took to the streets of São Paulo in their thousands.
[47:41.720 --> 47:46.360]  The national flag is waved above the crowds as they gathered outside the headquarters
[47:46.360 --> 47:48.960]  of the military's southeastern command.
[47:48.960 --> 47:57.160]  They're calling for an intervention, put simply, they want a military coup.
[47:57.160 --> 48:05.760]  They despise the leftist policies of Lula da Silva, and they want him out by any means.
[48:05.760 --> 48:09.400]  I think the red wave that's coming is going to be like the elevator doors opening up in
[48:09.400 --> 48:16.360]  the shining.
[48:16.360 --> 48:22.040]  Reporting for Infowars, this is Greg Rees.
[48:22.040 --> 48:28.560]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[48:28.560 --> 48:33.440]  And we are now into hour number two of this five Sunday night broadcast, hour three and
[48:33.440 --> 48:36.520]  four, Dr. Peter McCullough in studio.
[48:36.520 --> 48:40.800]  He's taking the gloves off, saying yes, it is the population weapon, the poison shot,
[48:40.800 --> 48:44.880]  one of the most respected doctors and scientists, one of the most peer-reviewed people out there.
[48:44.880 --> 48:48.000]  That's coming up in hour number three and four.
[48:48.000 --> 48:52.960]  And then tomorrow morning, 8 a.m. American Journal, Harrison Smith, my own show, 11-3
[48:52.960 --> 48:53.960]  p.m.
[48:53.960 --> 48:58.240]  The War Room, I went to Troyer's War Room, 3-6 p.m., and then don't forget, kicking off
[48:58.240 --> 49:02.240]  Tuesday morning, we're going right through midnight, election coverage, and we're going
[49:02.240 --> 49:06.520]  to get into all that now in the next 55 minutes with Laura Lummer.
[49:06.520 --> 49:09.120]  She's riding shotgun with us as a political analyst.
[49:09.120 --> 49:14.280]  She's one of the most manned people in the world, the most manned woman.
[49:14.280 --> 49:19.840]  And she has run for Congress and almost won recently by just a few points, despite the
[49:19.840 --> 49:22.480]  Republican establishment working against her.
[49:22.480 --> 49:23.480]  But that's a side issue.
[49:23.480 --> 49:29.160]  I want to get her take on the election, on Trump, the Santas, and that rift on what she's
[49:29.160 --> 49:34.440]  predicting for the midterms, open up in just about 35 hours.
[49:34.440 --> 49:38.360]  We're also going to be looking at a pack that she's involved with that's doing a great
[49:38.360 --> 49:42.840]  job putting out some powerful national TV ads exposing the Democrats in general, their
[49:42.840 --> 49:47.640]  poison shots, and their penchant for promoting pedophilia that have gone super viral, saw
[49:47.640 --> 49:50.640]  Steve Bannon in his War Room covering with her a few days ago.
[49:50.640 --> 49:53.200]  So I wanted to get her on with us.
[49:53.200 --> 49:58.280]  But before we drill into these ads, and the rest of it, Laura, great to see you there,
[49:58.280 --> 49:59.280]  Tom.
[49:59.280 --> 50:02.840]  Only the people who can find you is actually going to your site, one of the most censored
[50:02.840 --> 50:03.840]  people out there.
[50:03.840 --> 50:06.680]  They can find some of the conservative social media you're on there, but you're still doing
[50:06.680 --> 50:07.680]  amazing work.
[50:07.680 --> 50:10.280]  And in many ways, more effective than ever, Lumbered.com.
[50:10.280 --> 50:15.720]  Laura, with 30-something hours left until the polls open, obviously, red tsunami, but
[50:15.720 --> 50:18.720]  can the seawall of election fraud block it?
[50:18.720 --> 50:20.720]  What do you expect to see?
[50:20.720 --> 50:24.320]  Well, Alex, thanks so much for having me on.
[50:24.320 --> 50:25.880]  I appreciate it.
[50:25.880 --> 50:30.200]  And look, as an America First candidate myself, who recently had my own election stolen from
[50:30.200 --> 50:36.920]  me during my primary here in Florida in August, I'll say that I'm cautiously optimistic, but
[50:36.920 --> 50:39.080]  I'm not really getting my hopes up.
[50:39.080 --> 50:43.600]  The Republican Party has done absolutely nothing to address voter fraud.
[50:43.600 --> 50:45.440]  I'm talking about machine fraud.
[50:45.440 --> 50:48.240]  I'm talking about massive mail-in ballot fraud.
[50:48.240 --> 50:54.920]  Since the stolen 2020 election, to this day, the official RNC and Republican Party leadership
[50:54.920 --> 51:00.680]  has not even issued an official statement admitting that the 2020 election was stolen.
[51:00.680 --> 51:06.920]  Here in Florida, you had politicians like Governor Ron DeSantis promising, right, promising
[51:06.920 --> 51:11.360]  that he was going to ban big tech social media censorship in the state of Florida.
[51:11.360 --> 51:16.360]  But big tech, as we have seen, is allowed to roam completely wild here in the state of
[51:16.360 --> 51:17.360]  Florida.
[51:17.360 --> 51:22.720]  Zero punishment whatsoever from big tech, completely deplatforming and silencing people.
[51:22.720 --> 51:27.760]  And so there aren't really a lot of measures that have been taken nationwide to prevent
[51:27.760 --> 51:28.760]  the fraud.
[51:28.760 --> 51:33.560]  However, I think that, given the fact, right, that the Democrat Party has now decided to
[51:33.560 --> 51:40.360]  embrace full-blown pedophilia and violent criminals, and they are advocating for open
[51:40.360 --> 51:44.920]  borders, allowing for criminals and terrorists and poisonous fentanyl to come across our
[51:44.920 --> 51:52.480]  border, over 5 million illegal aliens coming in since Joe Biden, you know, occupied the
[51:52.480 --> 51:56.920]  White House as an illegitimate dementia patient.
[51:56.920 --> 52:01.600]  Even Democrats, even your most moderate Democrats, are saying that this is too much for them.
[52:01.600 --> 52:06.160]  So I'm thinking that maybe this extreme radical shift in the Democrat Party might be enough
[52:06.160 --> 52:08.200]  to push the Republicans over.
[52:08.200 --> 52:13.440]  But I do think, and from seeing it myself here on the ground in Florida, we don't have
[52:13.440 --> 52:15.440]  election integrity in this country.
[52:15.440 --> 52:19.840]  And so people definitely need to be vigilant and aware, because the cheaters are going
[52:19.840 --> 52:20.840]  to be out.
[52:20.840 --> 52:25.000]  We've already seen videos in Florida from Broward County of people illegally stuffing
[52:25.000 --> 52:29.360]  ballot boxes with multiple ballots this election season.
[52:29.360 --> 52:34.000]  People need to be alert, because people are going to be cheating to try to stop this red
[52:34.000 --> 52:35.000]  wave.
[52:35.000 --> 52:36.000]  Well, that's right.
[52:36.000 --> 52:37.000]  There's been arrest all over the country.
[52:37.000 --> 52:43.400]  Texas, Wisconsin, open charges where they're just catching Democrats already creating fake
[52:43.400 --> 52:45.080]  ballots and stuffing them.
[52:45.080 --> 52:46.720]  But let's be very clear.
[52:46.720 --> 52:48.680]  We know how they generally steal it.
[52:48.680 --> 52:50.960]  With these mail-in ballots, not absentee, those are fine.
[52:50.960 --> 52:53.920]  Those are people that are on record, already as voters, and they ask for them themselves
[52:53.920 --> 52:54.920]  and they get them.
[52:54.920 --> 53:00.480]  But by bombing everywhere with these fake ballots, these ballots that can be faked,
[53:00.480 --> 53:04.680]  these raw blank ballots, they then put the names of dead people and folks that have moved
[53:04.680 --> 53:09.000]  out of the state or out of the jurisdiction on those, but they've only got so many bullets
[53:09.000 --> 53:12.800]  in their gun, so they can only use them in particular areas.
[53:12.800 --> 53:18.120]  That's why Biden's announced, Federman's announced, Obama's announced, Hillary's announced, MSNBC's
[53:18.120 --> 53:23.720]  announced CNN, New York Times, yes, in key battleground states, like Wisconsin, like Michigan,
[53:23.720 --> 53:28.320]  like Pennsylvania, like Arizona, over and over again, we're not going to know on election
[53:28.320 --> 53:29.320]  night.
[53:29.320 --> 53:32.400]  So we always knew before, but the Democrats are telling us, no, no, it's completely normal.
[53:32.400 --> 53:33.800]  You're not going to know.
[53:33.800 --> 53:38.200]  And now this in Pennsylvania, as folks know, a few years ago, they created an election
[53:38.200 --> 53:43.440]  integrity database run by the state to simply check and make sure that the person that's
[53:43.440 --> 53:44.440]  voted voted.
[53:44.440 --> 53:49.520]  Once they voted, it's in a database that they did vote so that the same name can't vote
[53:49.520 --> 53:50.520]  multiple times.
[53:50.520 --> 53:54.600]  So we know that Federman's losing by such tsunami levels in the real internal polling
[53:54.600 --> 53:55.600]  they've got.
[53:55.600 --> 53:58.120]  They don't have enough dead people or fake names to do it.
[53:58.120 --> 54:02.160]  So they have to cut off the election integrity computer system.
[54:02.160 --> 54:05.280]  And now that's been shut off and the Democrats are saying, sorry, it's not going to be there
[54:05.280 --> 54:06.280]  for the election.
[54:06.280 --> 54:11.920]  So now it's a total free for all in Pennsylvania breaking outage in PA voter database, a election
[54:11.920 --> 54:13.040]  day nears.
[54:13.040 --> 54:17.120]  The computer system of state runs to make sure there's no election fraud is down.
[54:17.120 --> 54:18.120]  What do you make of that?
[54:18.120 --> 54:19.120]  Laura Loomer.
[54:19.120 --> 54:23.240]  Well, it's no surprise and you're absolutely correct, Alex.
[54:23.240 --> 54:28.160]  It's now why all of a sudden we've seen a lot of, you know, so-called Democrat Party
[54:28.160 --> 54:33.320]  political strategists and analysts and a lot of these pundits on CNN and MSNBC talking
[54:33.320 --> 54:37.440]  about how the Republicans are going to steal the election.
[54:37.440 --> 54:38.440]  And so it's funny, right?
[54:38.440 --> 54:42.840]  Because they always told us in the aftermath of 2020 that we had the most secure election
[54:42.840 --> 54:46.560]  systems in this country and that it was impossible to steal elections.
[54:46.560 --> 54:49.720]  And now you're actually seeing reports, right?
[54:49.720 --> 54:57.440]  Early pre-election day reports from these political pundits and Democrat Party strategists, because
[54:57.440 --> 55:02.760]  I think that they know that deep down inside, if we were to truly have free and fair elections
[55:02.760 --> 55:06.440]  without any cheating in this country, it would be a massive red wave.
[55:06.440 --> 55:10.440]  It would truly be a sweeping red wave in this country.
[55:10.440 --> 55:17.100]  But they have to continuously justify the craziness, okay, and the absolute radical
[55:17.100 --> 55:22.080]  Communist takeover of their own party, because I don't even think Democrats are excited to
[55:22.080 --> 55:23.080]  get out and vote.
[55:23.080 --> 55:27.840]  You see Barack Obama, he's been stumping for some candidates in some of these swing states,
[55:27.840 --> 55:30.280]  and he's telling people, you have to get out and vote.
[55:30.280 --> 55:32.880]  These numbers are not good for the Democrat Party.
[55:32.880 --> 55:38.280]  The lowest early voting turnout numbers, lower than 2018, especially here in Florida, if
[55:38.280 --> 55:42.920]  you compare the numbers from Democrat early voting turnout in 2018 during the midterm
[55:42.920 --> 55:45.280]  race to the midterms now.
[55:45.280 --> 55:49.800]  And so there's not a lot of enthusiasm in the Democrat Party, because I think that really
[55:49.800 --> 55:56.600]  the Democrat Party has become so radical, okay, so pro-crime, pro-pedophilia, pro-open
[55:56.600 --> 56:02.240]  borders that a lot of Democrats are either going to be voting Republican or sitting
[56:02.240 --> 56:03.240]  this one out.
[56:03.240 --> 56:06.800]  That's what Laura, and let's elaborate on that, since you mentioned it.
[56:06.800 --> 56:12.000]  Here is Obama and a bunch of other star-studded top Democrats with Uncle Fester, the literal
[56:12.000 --> 56:16.800]  troll creature, Thedermann, who can't even talk, and he makes Biden look like the most
[56:16.800 --> 56:21.760]  eloquent orator in history since William Shakespeare or something.
[56:21.760 --> 56:27.080]  Well, here they are in Pennsylvania at their biggest rally, and it's not even the amount
[56:27.080 --> 56:31.520]  of people at a high school basketball game in a 2A town.
[56:31.520 --> 56:35.640]  I mean, it's literally maybe 10,000, 5,000 people.
[56:35.640 --> 56:39.920]  I mean, this is pathetic, so they had to black curtain it all off to make it look bigger
[56:39.920 --> 56:42.920]  for the media.
[56:42.920 --> 56:50.600]  Yeah, it's absolutely shameful, and you're right, you're right, Alex, I mean, here you
[56:50.600 --> 56:51.840]  have Fetterman.
[56:51.840 --> 56:57.640]  For those who didn't watch the debate in Pennsylvania the other nights between John Fetterman and
[56:57.640 --> 57:03.600]  Dr. Oz, they actually made Dr. Oz seem palatable, which is pretty hard to do, given the fact
[57:03.600 --> 57:09.000]  that Dr. Oz isn't exactly the most MAGA America first Republican out there.
[57:09.000 --> 57:14.040]  I personally preferred Kathy Barnett, but at the end of the day, John Fetterman, you
[57:14.040 --> 57:17.920]  said it yourself, he's in worse physical and cognitive shape than Joe Biden.
[57:17.920 --> 57:24.000]  I do believe that John Fetterman suffered a stroke after taking a lethal death jab, right?
[57:24.000 --> 57:28.600]  He was promoting the COVID vaccine, and then shortly after announcing he took the vaccine
[57:28.600 --> 57:32.360]  in the booster, he had a stroke, and that's why he can't speak.
[57:32.360 --> 57:37.720]  And so if anybody should be the poster child for why you should not take the COVID vaccine,
[57:37.720 --> 57:39.240]  I'm pretty sure it's John Fetterman.
[57:39.240 --> 57:42.280]  And by the way, even though I don't like Fetterman, he's obviously very out of control
[57:42.280 --> 57:44.280]  and corrupt.
[57:44.280 --> 57:47.720]  If people would just tell him, take a bunch of ivermectin, even when you have a serious
[57:47.720 --> 57:52.480]  onset of the protein crystals, taking large doses of ivermectin has been documented in
[57:52.480 --> 57:55.360]  major studies, would at least stop them growing.
[57:55.360 --> 58:04.880]  That's why people that have had really bad COVID, you kill long COVID by taking ivermectin.
[58:04.880 --> 58:11.080]  It's Sunday, November 6th, 2022, I'm your host, Alex Jones, Laura Limbers, Ryzen Shotgun,
[58:11.080 --> 58:16.000]  recovering the midterm actual election day that kicks off in just 35 hours.
[58:16.000 --> 58:21.480]  I want to put an image back on screen for TV viewers, radio listeners, I'll describe
[58:21.480 --> 58:27.680]  it, this is an image of Fetterman, who literally doesn't know what planet he's on, not just
[58:27.680 --> 58:28.680]  his speech patterns.
[58:28.680 --> 58:33.360]  You've had a stroke and have a speech problem, you thought like this or had trouble, is your
[58:33.360 --> 58:34.880]  mouth paralyzed partially?
[58:34.880 --> 58:40.880]  No, he's got cognitive problems, obvious brainstem problems.
[58:40.880 --> 58:44.400]  He tries to read off a teleprompter and can't do it.
[58:44.400 --> 58:51.320]  Everything he says is worse than Biden, but that's what Obama loves is zombies.
[58:51.320 --> 58:56.080]  Perfect puppets that'll do what they're told, so he and his controllers can run them.
[58:56.080 --> 59:01.000]  This is the next phase of puppets, you have Biden, you have Obama, you have Fetterman,
[59:01.000 --> 59:08.000]  all there at a arena that looks like it might hold 20,000 people and maybe there's 10,000
[59:08.000 --> 59:16.800]  and Trump getting 50, 60, 70, 100,000, I mean, that is maximum, maximum, maybe 6,000, right
[59:16.800 --> 59:18.640]  there, ladies and gentlemen.
[59:18.640 --> 59:22.080]  So I mean, that arena looks smaller in the Moody Center in Austin, that holds like 6,000,
[59:22.080 --> 59:27.200]  yeah, maybe, maybe that's 3,000, 4,000, I don't know, it's a very small crowd, put it back
[59:27.200 --> 59:31.160]  on screen for a minute for me, go ahead and pan over, those bleachers, let's just say it's
[59:31.160 --> 59:36.520]  1,000 on that side, 1,000 up at the bleachers on the other side, and then maybe on the ground,
[59:36.520 --> 59:44.440]  maybe 2,000, 3,000, maybe behind them, maybe another 500, I mean, wow, that's not even,
[59:44.440 --> 59:55.440]  that's not even 5,000 people, boys and girls, I mean, I mean, a 3A football game in Texas
[59:55.440 --> 59:59.600]  has got a lot more people than that, wow.
[59:59.600 --> 1:00:03.280]  So let's play a couple clips here, some of the latest Fetterman, it's not like he was
[1:00:03.280 --> 1:00:07.560]  in high wind and then the American flags fell down sometime during the speech, right as he
[1:00:07.560 --> 1:00:12.320]  gets up, they are typally all fall down, showing there was no preparation to put sandbags
[1:00:12.320 --> 1:00:17.440]  on him, which again, is an omen, because they don't care, they don't think things through,
[1:00:17.440 --> 1:00:24.880]  and then here he is saying he is against Roe v. Wade, doesn't know what planet he's on,
[1:00:24.880 --> 1:00:32.320]  even though he's super bloodthirsty and pro-abortion, here it is.
[1:00:32.320 --> 1:00:43.480]  I'm ready to serve Pennsylvania, I run on Roe v. Wade, I celebrate the demise of Roe
[1:00:43.480 --> 1:00:47.360]  v. Wade.
[1:00:47.360 --> 1:00:51.280]  You know, these are not out of context, we could play more of it if you'd like, I mean,
[1:00:51.280 --> 1:00:56.040]  I was watching, his speech was usually about 2 minutes long anyways, and it literally sounds
[1:00:56.040 --> 1:01:01.760]  like his brain's been put in a blender, Laura Loomer, is this not our type of who these slaves
[1:01:01.760 --> 1:01:02.760]  of Satan are?
[1:01:02.760 --> 1:01:07.400]  I mean, this is pathetic, but Obama is smiling like a Cheshire cat, when he's even found
[1:01:07.400 --> 1:01:09.760]  a better zombie than Biden.
[1:01:09.760 --> 1:01:15.080]  Well, you're absolutely correct, Alex, and it's like what you said, right?
[1:01:15.080 --> 1:01:20.640]  We already know that this is the third term for Barack Hussein Obama, Joe Biden doesn't
[1:01:20.640 --> 1:01:25.360]  even know what day it is, I don't even think Joe Biden knows who Joe Biden is, and you're
[1:01:25.360 --> 1:01:30.000]  correct in that Barack Hussein Obama, he likes puppets, because he's the one that's really
[1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:34.760]  controlling things and pulling all the strings behind the scenes, and he wants people who
[1:01:34.760 --> 1:01:38.240]  really can't think for themselves, people who are not going to push back, people who
[1:01:38.240 --> 1:01:44.880]  are not really going to put up much opposition to his destructive agenda, right, his communist
[1:01:44.880 --> 1:01:46.600]  agenda for America.
[1:01:46.600 --> 1:01:51.080]  And so that's why they want Fetterman, and of course, there's been a lot of speculation
[1:01:51.080 --> 1:01:57.560]  about whether Fetterman will have to step down if he somehow does manage to win, and
[1:01:57.560 --> 1:02:01.840]  I say that in quotation marks, because we do know from the report that you just shared
[1:02:01.840 --> 1:02:07.240]  on screen moments ago, that they're already preparing to steal the election out of Pennsylvania,
[1:02:07.240 --> 1:02:12.560]  just like they did in 2020, they're planning to have him step down and replace him immediately
[1:02:12.560 --> 1:02:17.960]  with his illegal alien wife, who I believe is an illegal alien from Brazil.
[1:02:17.960 --> 1:02:22.800]  And so if you think that John Fetterman is radical, wait until he steps down due to his
[1:02:22.800 --> 1:02:28.200]  cognitive incompetence, and they put his illegal alien wife in the position.
[1:02:28.200 --> 1:02:31.040]  So we have to make sure that that doesn't happen.
[1:02:31.040 --> 1:02:34.960]  But I did notice in that clip that nobody rushed to pick up the flags.
[1:02:34.960 --> 1:02:38.080]  I mean, that just shows you how much Democrats hate this country.
[1:02:38.080 --> 1:02:41.920]  Here, I was at a gala the other day, one of these political galas.
[1:02:41.920 --> 1:02:45.000]  There's a lot of political events, as you can imagine right now.
[1:02:45.000 --> 1:02:51.320]  And the flag somehow tilted, and there are people willing to really nose dive toward
[1:02:51.320 --> 1:02:55.640]  the stage at this gala to make sure that that American flag didn't touch the ground.
[1:02:55.640 --> 1:02:59.360]  Because you're not supposed to allow for an American flag to touch the ground.
[1:02:59.360 --> 1:03:03.880]  But you notice from that clip that not a single person rushed to pick up those flags.
[1:03:03.880 --> 1:03:07.080]  And let's be clear, Laura, we're not in a cult of the American flag.
[1:03:07.080 --> 1:03:10.400]  It's a beautiful flag, a beautiful country, the greatest in history.
[1:03:10.400 --> 1:03:14.480]  But it's respect for the veterans and the people that fought and died for it.
[1:03:14.480 --> 1:03:19.920]  It's a symbol of them, like grandma's ashes on the mantle, or somebody's tombstone.
[1:03:19.920 --> 1:03:23.520]  But beyond that, it is a symbol of sacrifice.
[1:03:23.520 --> 1:03:28.000]  And that's why we support it and honor it for those that fought and died for it.
[1:03:28.000 --> 1:03:29.000]  Absolutely.
[1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:34.840]  And you can see that clearly, John Fetterman and the Democrats and his supporters and Barack
[1:03:34.840 --> 1:03:39.120]  Hussein Obama and everybody that came out to that rally to support Fetterman, they clearly
[1:03:39.120 --> 1:03:42.840]  don't have respect for what the American flag represents and stands for.
[1:03:42.840 --> 1:03:47.120]  So that's why I tell people, it's really the lesser of two evils.
[1:03:47.120 --> 1:03:52.080]  I mean, I think that, and I say this as a two-time congressional candidate, an American
[1:03:52.080 --> 1:03:56.840]  first Republican who ran against a Democrat right in 2020, where I was endorsed by President
[1:03:56.840 --> 1:03:58.360]  Trump and he voted for me.
[1:03:58.360 --> 1:04:04.680]  And then again, right, against a rhino, anti-Trump election denying zombie, who is also cognitively
[1:04:04.680 --> 1:04:05.680]  unfit.
[1:04:05.680 --> 1:04:09.120]  And despite no establishment support, you almost beat him in the primary.
[1:04:09.120 --> 1:04:11.480]  You had a little bit of support, you don't want.
[1:04:11.480 --> 1:04:17.000]  Well, I do believe that I won and the election is currently being contested right now.
[1:04:17.000 --> 1:04:20.520]  There's a lawsuit that's actually been filed and you may have heard about the Democrat
[1:04:20.520 --> 1:04:24.680]  whistleblower in Orange County who came forward to talk about the massive ballot fraud that's
[1:04:24.680 --> 1:04:25.680]  happening.
[1:04:25.680 --> 1:04:26.680]  I did.
[1:04:26.680 --> 1:04:27.680]  That's big news.
[1:04:27.680 --> 1:04:29.480]  And I want to talk about that now, but let me give people a prelude to what's coming
[1:04:29.480 --> 1:04:30.480]  up.
[1:04:30.480 --> 1:04:33.600]  You're involved with an amazing pact that I've known about for years that is producing
[1:04:33.600 --> 1:04:34.600]  some of the best ads.
[1:04:34.600 --> 1:04:35.600]  You helped produce these ads.
[1:04:35.600 --> 1:04:36.600]  They are amazing.
[1:04:36.600 --> 1:04:37.600]  They're going super viral.
[1:04:37.600 --> 1:04:38.600]  We're going to air them next segment.
[1:04:38.600 --> 1:04:41.080]  We're going to air them all over the inforwards operation.
[1:04:41.080 --> 1:04:43.400]  They're just culture ads exposing really what the lefts for.
[1:04:43.400 --> 1:04:47.760]  We'll talk about those, but also play Joy Reid, one of the most amazing gaslighting videos
[1:04:47.760 --> 1:04:48.760]  yet.
[1:04:48.760 --> 1:04:51.760]  You've probably seen it, Laura, where she says inflation doesn't exist.
[1:04:51.760 --> 1:04:53.640]  It's a made up word.
[1:04:53.640 --> 1:04:55.920]  Another word she said that should be banned.
[1:04:55.920 --> 1:04:57.960]  Did you know inflation isn't real, Laura?
[1:04:57.960 --> 1:04:59.680]  I don't know.
[1:04:59.680 --> 1:05:04.480]  I've just been, I guess all I hear these days is how the Democrats want to gaslight us about
[1:05:04.480 --> 1:05:08.880]  being election deniers, but it turns out all these people are our inflation deniers
[1:05:08.880 --> 1:05:14.080]  and crime deniers and baby killing deniers and pedophilia deniers and, you know, not
[1:05:14.080 --> 1:05:15.080]  pedophilia deniers.
[1:05:15.080 --> 1:05:16.080]  They now endorse it.
[1:05:16.080 --> 1:05:17.080]  But you're right.
[1:05:17.080 --> 1:05:18.080]  They are deniers.
[1:05:18.080 --> 1:05:19.080]  Oh, yeah.
[1:05:19.080 --> 1:05:21.880]  The talking point by all hoechul, all of them is the crime's down.
[1:05:21.880 --> 1:05:23.880]  You didn't know that, Laura.
[1:05:23.880 --> 1:05:24.880]  Exactly.
[1:05:24.880 --> 1:05:29.280]  And so I say that if they're going to call us election deniers, because we know, right?
[1:05:29.280 --> 1:05:32.920]  Everybody with a brain knows that the 2020 election was stolen.
[1:05:32.920 --> 1:05:33.920]  Even Democrats.
[1:05:33.920 --> 1:05:37.720]  I mean, you're going to tell me that Joe Biden received more votes than Barack Hussein Obama.
[1:05:37.720 --> 1:05:39.000]  I don't think so.
[1:05:39.000 --> 1:05:44.120]  And so even Democrats should find this, this claim, right, that Joe Biden received the
[1:05:44.120 --> 1:05:49.600]  most votes out of anybody in U.S. history offensive because it's an insult to grassroots
[1:05:49.600 --> 1:05:50.600]  movements.
[1:05:50.600 --> 1:05:54.720]  And even though I cannot stand Barack Hussein Obama and anything that he represents, he
[1:05:54.720 --> 1:05:55.720]  still has.
[1:05:55.720 --> 1:05:59.640]  He did win those elections because they ran ringers against him, McCain and Romney.
[1:05:59.640 --> 1:06:00.640]  Stay there.
[1:06:00.640 --> 1:06:03.680]  We'll come back because it gets into election fraud, how it works, that big case in Florida
[1:06:03.680 --> 1:06:08.120]  that you're actually been covering and are actually connected to exposing with the Democrat
[1:06:08.120 --> 1:06:09.720]  coming out, admitting the fraud.
[1:06:09.720 --> 1:06:13.840]  And then I want to get to the Joy Reid clip and I want to get to these ads that are going
[1:06:13.840 --> 1:06:15.960]  viral really exposing these people.
[1:06:15.960 --> 1:06:19.440]  Laura Loomer, Laura is the best site, loomer.com.
[1:06:19.440 --> 1:06:22.440]  Yeah, loomer.com.
[1:06:22.440 --> 1:06:26.880]  And then for people when you show the ads, you can go to AmericanLibertyFund.com.
[1:06:26.880 --> 1:06:30.600]  That's where people can support the work that we're doing over these next crucial two days
[1:06:30.600 --> 1:06:35.360]  because my team and I are creating amazing ads and we want to air these on television
[1:06:35.360 --> 1:06:36.360]  across the nation.
[1:06:36.360 --> 1:06:38.880]  So you'll get to see them when we return from the break.
[1:06:38.880 --> 1:06:41.680]  We've already gone mega viral, so you've already won.
[1:06:41.680 --> 1:06:42.920]  We've got to make them go more viral.
[1:06:42.920 --> 1:06:43.920]  Stay with us.
[1:06:43.920 --> 1:06:59.320]  And we are back live broadcasting worldwide on this Sunday night.
[1:06:59.320 --> 1:07:05.680]  The midterms are in 34 hours from now East Coast time kicking off live coverage in FullWars.com
[1:07:05.680 --> 1:07:06.680]  for its last show.
[1:07:06.680 --> 1:07:11.040]  Okay, we're not like corporate media where they go, Jones says he loves Hitler.
[1:07:11.040 --> 1:07:12.040]  They don't show the clip.
[1:07:12.040 --> 1:07:13.040]  Not true.
[1:07:13.040 --> 1:07:15.040]  Or Jones says this and that don't show the clip.
[1:07:15.040 --> 1:07:16.040]  They're lying.
[1:07:16.040 --> 1:07:18.960]  We tell you Joy Reid's gaslighting about inflation.
[1:07:18.960 --> 1:07:20.280]  It's a talking point.
[1:07:20.280 --> 1:07:23.840]  It's not important if one of them just said something like this, but they're all over
[1:07:23.840 --> 1:07:28.600]  the news saying Republicans want to put you in a death camp and kill your children.
[1:07:28.600 --> 1:07:31.840]  On Friday, I played some of those clips.
[1:07:31.840 --> 1:07:37.760]  And it's the same talking point that oh, inflation is just some fancy Republican term.
[1:07:37.760 --> 1:07:41.160]  You wouldn't know it if they weren't using it to control you.
[1:07:41.160 --> 1:07:45.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, we all learned about inflation in our first economics class.
[1:07:45.960 --> 1:07:46.960]  At least I did.
[1:07:46.960 --> 1:07:48.920]  They teach there were else, don't they?
[1:07:48.920 --> 1:07:50.520]  About over printing money.
[1:07:50.520 --> 1:07:55.360]  You learn about the Weimar Republic or in recent years you learn about Zimbabwe or you learn
[1:07:55.360 --> 1:07:59.600]  about Mexico that you value their peso in the early 1990s.
[1:07:59.600 --> 1:08:03.720]  It helps the rich people who get the use of the money printing first and they pass it
[1:08:03.720 --> 1:08:07.920]  on to the middle class and the poor people in the middle class gets a lot smaller.
[1:08:07.920 --> 1:08:10.520]  It is a tool of war.
[1:08:10.520 --> 1:08:17.520]  If you look at Brazil or you look at Argentina or you look at Costa Rica or you look at Venezuela,
[1:08:17.520 --> 1:08:25.020]  all those countries until the 60s and 70s were richer per capita than the average American.
[1:08:25.020 --> 1:08:29.480]  And then their governments devalued their currencies with the IMF and World Bank and
[1:08:29.480 --> 1:08:32.800]  now their hell holes in many areas.
[1:08:32.800 --> 1:08:33.800]  Very sad.
[1:08:33.800 --> 1:08:35.480]  I'd love to be able to live forever.
[1:08:35.480 --> 1:08:36.480]  Brazil's gorgeous.
[1:08:36.480 --> 1:08:37.480]  Mexico's gorgeous.
[1:08:37.480 --> 1:08:38.920]  Sorry, their governments did.
[1:08:38.920 --> 1:08:40.640]  What are governments now doing?
[1:08:40.640 --> 1:08:44.800]  Can we point our finger at Mexico and go, oh, look at you people and, you know, our dollar
[1:08:44.800 --> 1:08:46.560]  buys 10 times what your does.
[1:08:46.560 --> 1:08:53.480]  Not very long because what they did in Mexico, they're now doing to us and it is, I just got
[1:08:53.480 --> 1:08:54.480]  a chill of anger.
[1:08:54.480 --> 1:08:59.880]  It is robbery of people's social security and their whole future and businesses and savings
[1:08:59.880 --> 1:09:01.960]  and it is so destructive.
[1:09:01.960 --> 1:09:10.040]  So here she is saying price increases driven by devaluation of currency is a made up, fancy
[1:09:10.040 --> 1:09:15.600]  term by the Republicans where if she was honest, she'd say the Republicans have been part
[1:09:15.600 --> 1:09:16.600]  of this too.
[1:09:16.600 --> 1:09:20.280]  I mean, the Republicans drive the car of inflation at about 65 miles an hour.
[1:09:20.280 --> 1:09:21.280]  That's wrong.
[1:09:21.280 --> 1:09:25.320]  Biden's been driving at about 400 miles an hour.
[1:09:25.320 --> 1:09:26.920]  So there's the difference.
[1:09:26.920 --> 1:09:29.240]  It's been really bad.
[1:09:29.240 --> 1:09:34.160]  And look, you can have inflation if your country dominates the world because then your prices
[1:09:34.160 --> 1:09:38.000]  still don't go up even though your currency's been inflated and Trump tried that gamble.
[1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:39.400]  Everybody was coming back here.
[1:09:39.400 --> 1:09:45.640]  He went along with some of it, but Biden's created now it's 56% of the money in history
[1:09:45.640 --> 1:09:46.640]  in less than two years.
[1:09:46.640 --> 1:09:48.400]  I'm going to say that again.
[1:09:48.400 --> 1:09:59.880]  From 1776 and really 1789 was official from 1789 until January 2001, only 47% of the money
[1:09:59.880 --> 1:10:00.880]  was created.
[1:10:00.880 --> 1:10:05.480]  Now it's 50 plus percent has been created in less than two years, 2021 months.
[1:10:05.480 --> 1:10:12.760]  So in 21, 22 months, 50 plus percent of the money in history of the country has been created.
[1:10:12.760 --> 1:10:14.960]  And then you wonder why your prices are exploded.
[1:10:14.960 --> 1:10:18.800]  By the way, most suppliers don't try to increase prices we haven't, even though it's killing
[1:10:18.800 --> 1:10:23.400]  us because you just don't want to do it because your listeners can't pay it.
[1:10:23.400 --> 1:10:26.600]  And that's the line we're about to have to go up on prices.
[1:10:26.600 --> 1:10:29.760]  So everything's exploding because we can't buy it anymore.
[1:10:29.760 --> 1:10:34.760]  I had my main accountant tell me on Thursday, they said, you can't offer 60% off on that.
[1:10:34.760 --> 1:10:36.080]  They said, you lose money at that.
[1:10:36.080 --> 1:10:37.960]  So I went, okay, well, what products can I?
[1:10:37.960 --> 1:10:40.880]  Well, these and these, you're still making 10% on that.
[1:10:40.880 --> 1:10:43.640]  These other products, you're losing money at 60.
[1:10:43.640 --> 1:10:48.080]  So when you, so when you see the news, Jones grows 60 million this year.
[1:10:48.080 --> 1:10:49.440]  Well, yeah.
[1:10:49.440 --> 1:10:51.200]  And we sell stuff mainly at sale.
[1:10:51.200 --> 1:10:53.440]  So we're operating on 20 million.
[1:10:53.440 --> 1:10:57.240]  That's the whole point, ladies and gentlemen, and that's what they're manipulating out there.
[1:10:57.240 --> 1:11:00.920]  And so if you run a business or you live in the real world, you know how bad this is.
[1:11:00.920 --> 1:11:03.640]  It hasn't gotten to the general public that's employed yet.
[1:11:03.640 --> 1:11:06.680]  I know I'm ranting and we get Laura Loomers take on this for a moment, get to her amazing
[1:11:06.680 --> 1:11:07.680]  pack ad.
[1:11:07.680 --> 1:11:08.760]  She's running nationwide.
[1:11:08.760 --> 1:11:11.080]  But here is the clip I was talking about.
[1:11:11.080 --> 1:11:18.320]  The people I ever heard here use the word inflation are journalists and economists, right?
[1:11:18.320 --> 1:11:22.840]  So that is not part of the normal lexicon of the way people talk.
[1:11:22.840 --> 1:11:26.240]  So it's interesting that Republicans are doing something they don't normally do, right?
[1:11:26.240 --> 1:11:28.960]  Which is not use the common tongue, right?
[1:11:28.960 --> 1:11:31.760]  Not use just common English to sort of use, do on their campaigns like they're doing with
[1:11:31.760 --> 1:11:32.920]  prime.
[1:11:32.920 --> 1:11:36.600]  But what they've done is they've taught people the word inflation, right?
[1:11:36.600 --> 1:11:39.400]  Most people who would have never used that word ever in their lives are using it now
[1:11:39.400 --> 1:11:41.640]  because they've been taught it.
[1:11:41.640 --> 1:11:46.200]  Including on TV, including in newspapers, they've been taught this word.
[1:11:46.200 --> 1:11:50.920]  And they sort of wrap this word around whatever it is that they really want to vote, you know,
[1:11:50.920 --> 1:11:52.600]  the reasons they really want to vote.
[1:11:52.600 --> 1:11:53.720]  You know where they've been taught it?
[1:11:53.720 --> 1:12:02.440]  When Trump left office, the average cost of premium 93 octane was $2.32.
[1:12:02.440 --> 1:12:04.560]  Diesel was even less.
[1:12:04.560 --> 1:12:11.880]  And now diesel's over five and the national average is almost $4 for 93 octane.
[1:12:11.880 --> 1:12:13.080]  Some areas it's $7, $8.
[1:12:13.080 --> 1:12:14.080]  You've seen that.
[1:12:14.080 --> 1:12:15.160]  Diesel's up to nine in some areas.
[1:12:15.160 --> 1:12:21.560]  So what teaches people about inflation is when they used to fill their car for 50 bucks
[1:12:21.560 --> 1:12:23.400]  and now it costs 100.
[1:12:23.400 --> 1:12:28.920]  When they used to buy a package of bacon for $3 and now it costs $7 or they used to buy
[1:12:28.920 --> 1:12:33.320]  a four pack of yogurt because I do a lot of the shopping, I used to buy that for $3.
[1:12:33.320 --> 1:12:34.320]  Now it's $8.
[1:12:34.320 --> 1:12:38.200]  When I used to buy a gallon of milk for $2 and now it's $5, when I used to buy a carton
[1:12:38.200 --> 1:12:44.440]  of egg for $3 and now it's $7, when I used to buy a thing of ham for $3, now it's $10.
[1:12:44.440 --> 1:12:46.600]  You know, you know, no, no, no.
[1:12:46.600 --> 1:12:51.240]  We know when I used to go to a steakhouse and the delicious steak was $25.
[1:12:51.240 --> 1:12:52.240]  Now it's $50.
[1:12:52.240 --> 1:12:57.440]  Laura, we're being taught inflation by being beat over the head with it, aren't we?
[1:12:57.440 --> 1:13:00.440]  Absolutely, Alex.
[1:13:00.440 --> 1:13:04.200]  And it just goes to show you, too, how the Democrat party, you know, they just have so
[1:13:04.200 --> 1:13:09.680]  much disdain and contempt for the average American voter or American citizen.
[1:13:09.680 --> 1:13:12.120]  They really honestly think that people are stupid.
[1:13:12.120 --> 1:13:17.400]  They think that we're a bunch of brain dead minions and that, you know, we just need to
[1:13:17.400 --> 1:13:21.200]  sit back and be quiet because we don't know what's good for us and we just have to listen
[1:13:21.200 --> 1:13:26.880]  to the pundits on CNN and MSNBC tell us what we need to know and we don't need to know
[1:13:26.880 --> 1:13:30.160]  anything else except for what they tell us we need to know.
[1:13:30.160 --> 1:13:31.640]  And so it's very insulting.
[1:13:31.640 --> 1:13:36.920]  I think I saw another clip the other day, I forget some, and I can't recall which pundit
[1:13:36.920 --> 1:13:40.640]  it was who said it, but they said the same thing that Joy Reese said, but they were talking
[1:13:40.640 --> 1:13:42.320]  about the black community.
[1:13:42.320 --> 1:13:46.200]  They said that black people do not know what inflation is.
[1:13:46.200 --> 1:13:50.800]  And so they're insulting, you know, their traditional voting base.
[1:13:50.800 --> 1:13:54.680]  You're seeing a shift in black voters and Hispanic voters move from the Democrat party
[1:13:54.680 --> 1:13:57.000]  over to the Republican party.
[1:13:57.000 --> 1:14:03.360]  And now we're seeing how the Democrat party truly feels about minorities who have traditionally
[1:14:03.360 --> 1:14:04.360]  voted Democrat.
[1:14:04.360 --> 1:14:08.200]  They really honestly think these people are stupid, but I'm glad that they're saying it
[1:14:08.200 --> 1:14:12.540]  because it's good for people to hear it out in the open to understand what the Democrat
[1:14:12.540 --> 1:14:16.920]  party thinks of them so that they know to get off the Democrat party plantation and
[1:14:16.920 --> 1:14:20.640]  start voting for policies and voting for America first candidates that are actually
[1:14:20.640 --> 1:14:24.000]  going to put them and their families in their best interests.
[1:14:24.000 --> 1:14:29.040]  Wasn't this a Marie Antoinette quote, there's nobody knows a Marie Antoinette actually said
[1:14:29.040 --> 1:14:32.520]  when they were hundreds of thousands starving doesn't bear us and they said, please open
[1:14:32.520 --> 1:14:34.600]  up the grain reserves are starving to death, the children are dying.
[1:14:34.600 --> 1:14:35.760]  She said, let them eat cake.
[1:14:35.760 --> 1:14:38.640]  We don't know if she said that, but Joy Reed just said, let them eat cake.
[1:14:38.640 --> 1:14:40.280]  She said, this doesn't exist.
[1:14:40.280 --> 1:14:43.040]  They taught them price increases.
[1:14:43.040 --> 1:14:44.040]  Nobody's heard.
[1:14:44.040 --> 1:14:46.840]  That is such a disconnected evil statement.
[1:14:46.840 --> 1:14:50.440]  Well, that's why the Democrats should lose.
[1:14:50.440 --> 1:14:52.880]  That's why there should be a massive red wave.
[1:14:52.880 --> 1:14:57.440]  That's why, you know, there should have been a massive red wave in 2020 as well.
[1:14:57.440 --> 1:15:01.920]  But that's why, of course, we see the Democrats, the only way they can, quote, unquote, win
[1:15:01.920 --> 1:15:03.640]  is by cheating.
[1:15:03.640 --> 1:15:09.240]  This is the same messaging that was pushed out in 2020, except with regards to crime.
[1:15:09.240 --> 1:15:12.480]  We had Black Lives Matter in Antifa destroying our cities.
[1:15:12.480 --> 1:15:14.920]  They told us, you don't know what violent crime is.
[1:15:14.920 --> 1:15:17.120]  You don't know what domestic terrorism is.
[1:15:17.120 --> 1:15:18.800]  That's a peaceful protest.
[1:15:18.800 --> 1:15:23.360]  And now, they've used that same argument and that same logic, but applied it to our economy
[1:15:23.360 --> 1:15:28.960]  when many Americans are going without three meals a day because so many people are struggling.
[1:15:28.960 --> 1:15:33.120]  Even if you're making over $70,000 a year, I was watching a report out of New York the
[1:15:33.120 --> 1:15:34.120]  other day.
[1:15:34.120 --> 1:15:39.360]  New York families making $70,000 to $80,000 per year are living paycheck to paycheck and
[1:15:39.360 --> 1:15:43.560]  are having to make tough decisions about whether they put food on the table for their kids
[1:15:43.560 --> 1:15:48.600]  or more gas in their cars, because the price of everything goes up, which, of course, diminishes
[1:15:48.600 --> 1:15:51.120]  your overall yearly annual salary.
[1:15:51.120 --> 1:15:56.240]  So everybody's, you know, feeling the pain at the pump and is truly experiencing and
[1:15:56.240 --> 1:16:01.600]  seeing inflation in real time when they watch their bank accounts get destroyed.
[1:16:01.600 --> 1:16:04.920]  What was the exact quote of Biden a month ago with an ice cream cone in his hand?
[1:16:04.920 --> 1:16:07.920]  He said, we have an incredibly strong economy.
[1:16:07.920 --> 1:16:11.920]  What was the quote?
[1:16:11.920 --> 1:16:13.440]  I don't know what the quote was.
[1:16:13.440 --> 1:16:15.120]  You'll have to pull up the video.
[1:16:15.120 --> 1:16:16.120]  Yeah, Biden.
[1:16:16.120 --> 1:16:17.120]  We'll be right back.
[1:16:17.120 --> 1:16:22.120]  Biden said the economy was strong as hell.
[1:16:22.120 --> 1:16:23.120]  Here it is.
[1:16:23.120 --> 1:16:24.120]  Just one more economic one.
[1:16:24.120 --> 1:16:27.120]  Are you concerned about the strength of the dollar right now?
[1:16:27.120 --> 1:16:32.120]  I'm not concerned about the chance to develop.
[1:16:32.120 --> 1:16:37.120]  I'm concerned about the rest of the world.
[1:16:37.120 --> 1:16:38.120]  Does that make sense?
[1:16:38.120 --> 1:16:39.120]  Yes.
[1:16:39.120 --> 1:16:41.120]  Our economy is strong as hell.
[1:16:41.120 --> 1:16:47.120]  In the internals, inflation is worldwide.
[1:16:47.120 --> 1:16:51.120]  Of course, off everywhere else in the United States.
[1:16:51.120 --> 1:16:52.120]  That's a talking point.
[1:16:52.120 --> 1:17:01.120]  So the problem is the lack of economic growth and sound policy in other countries.
[1:17:01.120 --> 1:17:02.120]  Not so much.
[1:17:02.120 --> 1:17:06.120]  So when Kirby got asked that question, he's out with the White House helping out, he's
[1:17:06.120 --> 1:17:07.120]  at the same thing.
[1:17:07.120 --> 1:17:11.120]  We don't care about America, we care about Ukraine.
[1:17:11.120 --> 1:17:14.120]  Laura Loomer is our guest.
[1:17:14.120 --> 1:17:19.120]  Dr. Pierre McCullough in studio coming up in our three and four tonight.
[1:17:19.120 --> 1:17:20.120]  It's a big article.
[1:17:20.120 --> 1:17:25.120]  He just exposes who's behind the COVID, who's behind the shots.
[1:17:25.120 --> 1:17:27.120]  This is going to be a big interview.
[1:17:27.120 --> 1:17:29.120]  The gloves are off.
[1:17:29.120 --> 1:17:32.120]  Laura, get into this pack you're involved with.
[1:17:32.120 --> 1:17:33.120]  I've seen his work before.
[1:17:33.120 --> 1:17:34.120]  It's great stuff.
[1:17:34.120 --> 1:17:39.120]  And then preface, you want to go to the COVID ads that you cut, that you made for the pack
[1:17:39.120 --> 1:17:43.120]  or do you want to get to the pedo and first showing how the Democrats are?
[1:17:43.120 --> 1:17:44.120]  Well, we can show both of them.
[1:17:44.120 --> 1:17:47.120]  Let's start with the groomer, the pedophile ad.
[1:17:47.120 --> 1:17:52.120]  But yeah, after my campaign ended, I was actually invited to come work with a pack
[1:17:52.120 --> 1:17:54.120]  called American Liberty Fund.
[1:17:54.120 --> 1:17:59.120]  And American Liberty Fund is a pack that is focused on supporting pro-liberty candidates.
[1:17:59.120 --> 1:18:04.120]  Candidates that are focused on preserving our freedoms and our liberties.
[1:18:04.120 --> 1:18:09.120]  And you see that political messaging in the Republican Party is very weak.
[1:18:09.120 --> 1:18:15.120]  And even though these issues of sexualization of our children and people dying from vaccine
[1:18:15.120 --> 1:18:19.120]  injuries and the death shot and children getting myocarditis are in the news, thanks
[1:18:19.120 --> 1:18:25.120]  to people like you and grassroots independent media every single day, you see so many
[1:18:25.120 --> 1:18:29.120]  Republican and even so called America first candidates.
[1:18:29.120 --> 1:18:33.120]  And I say that, of course, because not everybody who calls themselves America first actually
[1:18:33.120 --> 1:18:34.120]  is America first.
[1:18:34.120 --> 1:18:37.120]  They refuse to talk about these issues.
[1:18:37.120 --> 1:18:40.120]  And so we decided to actually create advertisements.
[1:18:40.120 --> 1:18:44.120]  My team and I, Norman, who does incredible animations.
[1:18:44.120 --> 1:18:47.120]  And then Shane Corey, who is the founder of the pack.
[1:18:47.120 --> 1:18:50.120]  And Laura, Laura, where do people find the ads?
[1:18:50.120 --> 1:18:52.120]  We're about to play and people can clip out of the show and play.
[1:18:52.120 --> 1:18:55.120]  I'm going to find them in better quality before.
[1:18:55.120 --> 1:18:56.120]  Yeah.
[1:18:56.120 --> 1:18:57.120]  American Liberty Fund.
[1:18:57.120 --> 1:18:59.120]  That's AmericanLibertyFund.com.
[1:18:59.120 --> 1:19:04.120]  And then you can also find them on my telegram and my accounts.
[1:19:04.120 --> 1:19:06.120]  AmericanLibertyFund.com.
[1:19:06.120 --> 1:19:10.120]  Let's just do this because there's there's two poison Vax ads.
[1:19:10.120 --> 1:19:12.120]  We'll play those secondary back to back.
[1:19:12.120 --> 1:19:13.120]  Play them all back to back.
[1:19:13.120 --> 1:19:15.120]  Here is the anti-pino ad.
[1:19:15.120 --> 1:19:19.120]  This book that you expose is at the Austin Library.
[1:19:19.120 --> 1:19:22.120]  For middle school and high schoolers.
[1:19:22.120 --> 1:19:24.120]  This is all over the country.
[1:19:24.120 --> 1:19:27.120]  There are hundreds of these type books we've reviewed.
[1:19:27.120 --> 1:19:28.120]  More than 50 of them here.
[1:19:28.120 --> 1:19:30.120]  And let me tell you, I've been scarred by looking at it.
[1:19:30.120 --> 1:19:32.120]  I can't imagine children looking at it.
[1:19:32.120 --> 1:19:35.120]  It's kids being picked up by pedophiles and then loving it,
[1:19:35.120 --> 1:19:37.120]  training kids to get in vans with men.
[1:19:37.120 --> 1:19:39.120]  Let's go ahead and roll it.
[1:19:39.120 --> 1:19:41.120]  Put something into your.
[1:19:41.120 --> 1:19:44.120]  Not even a.
[1:19:44.120 --> 1:19:46.120]  So you've never.
[1:19:46.120 --> 1:19:49.120]  Yourself.
[1:19:49.120 --> 1:19:52.120]  As a team, I got bored of.
[1:19:52.120 --> 1:19:55.120]  I then dreamed about having a massive.
[1:19:55.120 --> 1:19:58.120]  That lasted all day.
[1:19:58.120 --> 1:20:01.120]  Do you feel sad that you weren't born with.
[1:20:01.120 --> 1:20:05.120]  These are exact excerpts from the book gender queer.
[1:20:05.120 --> 1:20:08.120]  This book is being taught to public school children.
[1:20:08.120 --> 1:20:12.120]  America, we have a problem on November 8th.
[1:20:12.120 --> 1:20:14.120]  Vote to stop.
[1:20:14.120 --> 1:20:19.120]  On November 8th, vote to stop the sexualization of your kids.
[1:20:19.120 --> 1:20:22.120]  Vote Republican paid for by American Liberty Fund,
[1:20:22.120 --> 1:20:25.120]  not authorized by any candidate or candidate committee.
[1:20:25.120 --> 1:20:28.120]  All right, here's two of the ads exposing the death shot.
[1:20:28.120 --> 1:20:30.120]  Mommy, I don't want to get it.
[1:20:30.120 --> 1:20:32.120]  Mommy, I'm not sick.
[1:20:32.120 --> 1:20:34.120]  Mommy, please.
[1:20:34.120 --> 1:20:35.120]  I'm scared.
[1:20:35.120 --> 1:20:37.120]  I'm sorry, baby.
[1:20:37.120 --> 1:20:39.120]  I wish I had a choice.
[1:20:39.120 --> 1:20:42.120]  The CDC is recommending the COVID-19 vaccine
[1:20:42.120 --> 1:20:44.120]  for all school children.
[1:20:44.120 --> 1:20:47.120]  If Democrat Kathy Huckle gets elected as governor of New York,
[1:20:47.120 --> 1:20:50.120]  you may no longer have the same your child's health.
[1:20:50.120 --> 1:20:52.120]  On November 8th, vote for parental rights.
[1:20:52.120 --> 1:20:55.120]  Vote Republican, paid for by American Liberty Fund,
[1:20:55.120 --> 1:20:58.120]  not authorized by any candidate or candidate's committee.
[1:20:58.120 --> 1:21:00.120]  Mommy, I don't want to get it.
[1:21:00.120 --> 1:21:02.120]  Mommy, I'm not sick.
[1:21:02.120 --> 1:21:04.120]  Mommy, please.
[1:21:04.120 --> 1:21:05.120]  I'm scared.
[1:21:05.120 --> 1:21:07.120]  I'm sorry, baby.
[1:21:07.120 --> 1:21:09.120]  I wish I had a choice.
[1:21:09.120 --> 1:21:12.120]  The CDC is recommending the COVID-19 vaccine
[1:21:12.120 --> 1:21:14.120]  for all school children.
[1:21:14.120 --> 1:21:17.120]  If Democrat Josh Shapiro gets elected as governor of Pennsylvania,
[1:21:17.120 --> 1:21:20.120]  you may no longer have the same your child's health.
[1:21:20.120 --> 1:21:22.120]  On November 8th, vote for parental rights.
[1:21:22.120 --> 1:21:25.120]  Vote Republican, paid for by American Liberty Fund,
[1:21:25.120 --> 1:21:28.120]  not authorized by any candidate or candidate's committee.
[1:21:28.120 --> 1:21:30.120]  And again, that means that's an independent pack
[1:21:30.120 --> 1:21:32.120]  and do whatever it wants, and that's the beauty of these,
[1:21:32.120 --> 1:21:34.120]  to be able to warn people.
[1:21:34.120 --> 1:21:37.120]  I want to see some ads, too, about the UN, about censorship,
[1:21:37.120 --> 1:21:41.120]  about all these different organizations, Laura Lummer.
[1:21:41.120 --> 1:21:43.120]  In closing here,
[1:21:43.120 --> 1:21:45.120]  because I got some final news after you leave us,
[1:21:45.120 --> 1:21:47.120]  what else do you want in part to the viewers and listeners
[1:21:47.120 --> 1:21:51.120]  of this broadcast on pretty much the eve of the election?
[1:21:51.120 --> 1:21:54.120]  Well, I appreciate you airing these ads, Alex,
[1:21:54.120 --> 1:21:57.120]  and I just want to let people know that American Liberty Fund
[1:21:57.120 --> 1:22:00.120]  and these ads that I've been writing and producing with my team,
[1:22:00.120 --> 1:22:03.120]  this is the tip of the spear of what political messaging
[1:22:03.120 --> 1:22:05.120]  needs to be on the right.
[1:22:05.120 --> 1:22:08.120]  I look forward to creating more of these powerful ads with my team, Alex,
[1:22:08.120 --> 1:22:11.120]  especially regarding these issues that you just highlighted,
[1:22:11.120 --> 1:22:14.120]  election integrity, a lot of things,
[1:22:14.120 --> 1:22:16.120]  the World Economic Forum,
[1:22:16.120 --> 1:22:20.120]  more vaccine injury ads, censorship, big tech tyranny.
[1:22:20.120 --> 1:22:24.120]  You're going to see a lot more from American Liberty Fund,
[1:22:24.120 --> 1:22:27.120]  but I just want everybody to be vigilant and aware.
[1:22:27.120 --> 1:22:30.120]  If you're going and voting at the polls, keep your eyes open.
[1:22:30.120 --> 1:22:32.120]  If you see any fraud, make sure you record it
[1:22:32.120 --> 1:22:36.120]  and you report it to your local sheriff because the Republican Party,
[1:22:36.120 --> 1:22:38.120]  they're not coming to save you, okay?
[1:22:38.120 --> 1:22:41.120]  The Republican Party was just as guilty as the Democrat Party
[1:22:41.120 --> 1:22:43.120]  in stealing the 2020 election.
[1:22:43.120 --> 1:22:47.120]  They had no election day, ground day operations in 2020,
[1:22:47.120 --> 1:22:52.120]  and I doubt that they're going to have strong election grounding operations
[1:22:52.120 --> 1:22:55.120]  this year to prevent fraud on election day.
[1:22:55.120 --> 1:22:57.120]  And so if you want your vote to count,
[1:22:57.120 --> 1:22:59.120]  you're going to have to be out there yourself.
[1:22:59.120 --> 1:23:01.120]  You're going to have to volunteer as a poll watcher, poll worker,
[1:23:01.120 --> 1:23:04.120]  and really keep your eyes open because it's a unit party.
[1:23:04.120 --> 1:23:07.120]  And regardless of which party is in control,
[1:23:07.120 --> 1:23:10.120]  I personally, I don't really see much of a difference.
[1:23:10.120 --> 1:23:13.120]  Obviously, I'm rooting for Republicans to win and take back the House,
[1:23:13.120 --> 1:23:17.120]  but with the likelihood of Kevin McCarthy potentially being Speaker of the House
[1:23:17.120 --> 1:23:21.120]  and a lot of candidates making deals with him behind the scenes
[1:23:21.120 --> 1:23:25.120]  and not really having the balls or the testicular fortitude, as I say,
[1:23:25.120 --> 1:23:29.120]  to campaign openly against the McCarthy speakership,
[1:23:29.120 --> 1:23:31.120]  which would be worse than Paul Ryan.
[1:23:31.120 --> 1:23:34.120]  We're talking about Paul Ryan on steroids times a million.
[1:23:34.120 --> 1:23:38.120]  That's what you're going to get with Kevin McCarthy, a Speaker of the House.
[1:23:38.120 --> 1:23:40.120]  Absolutely. Laura Lommer will talk to you on election night.
[1:23:40.120 --> 1:23:41.120]  Thank you so much.
[1:23:41.120 --> 1:23:43.120]  All right, let me just say this right here.
[1:23:43.120 --> 1:23:46.120]  I agree with her that the unit party is there,
[1:23:46.120 --> 1:23:50.120]  but there's a beachhead with Republicans, Trumpites, patriots,
[1:23:50.120 --> 1:23:52.120]  and whether you believe in the Senate or not,
[1:23:52.120 --> 1:23:55.120]  he's acting like a super patriot because he's making it popular.
[1:23:55.120 --> 1:23:58.120]  And so we're taking control of the party with great folks
[1:23:58.120 --> 1:24:01.120]  that are out there in the grassroots fighting like Laura Lommer.
[1:24:01.120 --> 1:24:02.120]  We're going to go to break here.
[1:24:02.120 --> 1:24:04.120]  Dr. Peter McCullough is coming in.
[1:24:04.120 --> 1:24:06.120]  Two-hour powerful interview.
[1:24:06.120 --> 1:24:07.120]  He's taking the gloves off.
[1:24:07.120 --> 1:24:08.120]  He don't want to miss his information.
[1:24:08.120 --> 1:24:11.120]  But let me hit these stories here that I forgot to get to.
[1:24:11.120 --> 1:24:14.120]  I'll cover more tomorrow on my regular weekday show.
[1:24:14.120 --> 1:24:17.120]  Report, pedophiles can exploit trans loopholes
[1:24:17.120 --> 1:24:20.120]  tied criminal history when applying to work with children
[1:24:20.120 --> 1:24:22.120]  in the U.K. London telegraph reports
[1:24:22.120 --> 1:24:24.120]  and in the United States is the same.
[1:24:24.120 --> 1:24:28.120]  It's men dressed up like women trying to get access to your children.
[1:24:28.120 --> 1:24:30.120]  And as I started the show, this is really important.
[1:24:30.120 --> 1:24:33.120]  Shock poll put on by the Democratic Party.
[1:24:33.120 --> 1:24:36.120]  Nearly half of American voters, 50% of Republicans,
[1:24:36.120 --> 1:24:39.120]  40% of independents, 30% of Democrats,
[1:24:39.120 --> 1:24:42.120]  believe a shadow criminal group is running America.
[1:24:42.120 --> 1:24:44.120]  That is extremely important.
[1:24:44.120 --> 1:24:46.120]  37% of Democrats, 41% of independents,
[1:24:46.120 --> 1:24:49.120]  and 3% of Republicans.
[1:24:49.120 --> 1:24:52.120]  A total of 44%, we have been doing our job.
[1:24:52.120 --> 1:24:55.120]  You've been doing your job and doing an incredible job.
[1:24:55.120 --> 1:24:58.120]  We are going to take the German government study,
[1:24:58.120 --> 1:25:01.120]  the Swedish government study, the U.S. government studies,
[1:25:01.120 --> 1:25:03.120]  showing the almost exact same numbers,
[1:25:03.120 --> 1:25:07.120]  3,600-plus percent increase in stillbirths,
[1:25:07.120 --> 1:25:10.120]  miscarriages in the vaccinated.
[1:25:10.120 --> 1:25:12.120]  That's the biggest in history.
[1:25:12.120 --> 1:25:15.120]  As soon as this broadcast, this live part ends,
[1:25:15.120 --> 1:25:17.120]  I'm going to go make sure that gets cut out
[1:25:17.120 --> 1:25:19.120]  and put on the front page of Bandai Video.
[1:25:19.120 --> 1:25:21.120]  We're going to save a lot of children and a lot of lives.
[1:25:21.120 --> 1:25:23.120]  They want abortion,
[1:25:23.120 --> 1:25:25.120]  but they can't get the average mother to kill their child.
[1:25:25.120 --> 1:25:28.120]  This is abortion. This is forced abortion.
[1:25:28.120 --> 1:25:30.120]  This is one child policy.
[1:25:30.120 --> 1:25:33.120]  Also, we're fearless.
[1:25:33.120 --> 1:25:35.120]  We're fighting for you. We're fighting for our shared destiny.
[1:25:35.120 --> 1:25:37.120]  We'll never back down.
[1:25:37.120 --> 1:25:39.120]  We'll never give up, but we can give out.
[1:25:39.120 --> 1:25:41.120]  We need financial support.
[1:25:41.120 --> 1:25:43.120]  So go to infowars.com, forward slash crypto.

[1:25:56.120 --> 1:25:58.120]  and beat all these fake judgments and the rest of it.
[1:25:58.120 --> 1:26:00.120]  But we need donations.
[1:26:00.120 --> 1:26:02.120]  Thanks for your past support. Those that haven't donated,
