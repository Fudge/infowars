[02:12.340 --> 02:18.820]  hour to talk about whatever issues you wish on the economy front jobless rate
[02:18.820 --> 02:26.780]  climbs 12% in the last two weeks wow 12% increase in people losing their jobs in
[02:26.780 --> 02:31.900]  the last two weeks and real unemployment's around 22% according to all
[02:31.900 --> 02:36.420]  the private indexes that are out there so you add this to it boy that is amazing
[02:36.420 --> 02:43.620]  also oil gains to around $79 a barrel amid mixed u.s. data you have world
[02:43.620 --> 02:47.940]  currencies declining in tandem through a coordinated effort of the private
[02:47.940 --> 02:52.540]  parasitic central banks that run our globe and the new world order and so of
[02:52.540 --> 02:58.700]  course you see gold surging to a six week high and gold futures rose today as
[02:58.700 --> 03:02.780]  well pushing prices on the precious metal to the highest in six weeks as the
[03:02.780 --> 03:07.620]  u.s. dollar declined increasing the appeal of gold as an alternative
[03:07.620 --> 03:11.940]  investment we told you this will be short-lived gold going down it's a
[03:11.940 --> 03:15.620]  buying opportunity and they may push it down again but if you look at the
[03:15.620 --> 03:22.700]  overall trend of gold the last decade it is up up up up up up and away because
[03:22.700 --> 03:29.180]  currencies are being debased it is a law of economics and currencies and
[03:29.180 --> 03:34.420]  commodities meanwhile in Alabama and other states they're reporting they
[03:34.420 --> 03:39.260]  can't hire enough local census workers people don't like doing it even though
[03:39.260 --> 03:43.420]  they need jobs they don't like going to people's doors and threatening to arrest
[03:43.420 --> 03:47.020]  them if they don't answer questions about their toilet their stocks and bonds
[03:47.020 --> 03:52.540]  their light bulbs their firearms all violations of the Fifth Amendment the
[03:52.540 --> 03:58.180]  police can't make you answer questions and a census worker sure can't do it
[03:58.180 --> 04:02.300]  in fact I may want to have a space later during open phones for just census
[04:02.300 --> 04:06.020]  workers to call in and to talk about what they think of their job and if they
[04:06.020 --> 04:09.220]  enjoy it or people that have been harassed by census workers but we'll
[04:09.220 --> 04:13.620]  see if that happens we have time to do that Medicare payment reductions worry
[04:13.620 --> 04:18.420]  doctors patients this out of bay news 9 and I saw similar reports across the
[04:18.420 --> 04:23.500]  country massive 21% reduction in Medicare and Medicaid payments see they're
[04:23.500 --> 04:28.300]  already just slashing even though they can't pass the health care bill to slash
[04:28.300 --> 04:35.020]  the banks have to get all the money all your tax money has to go to them
[04:35.020 --> 04:45.860]  continuing I saw a case of censorship today I saw a case of censorship today
[04:45.860 --> 04:51.300]  dealing with an article on blogspot dealing with Larry Silverstein that is
[04:51.300 --> 04:58.940]  coming up and a lot of other important news straight ahead more reports of well

[05:02.740 --> 05:07.140]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[05:07.140 --> 05:11.180]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[05:11.180 --> 05:15.100]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[05:15.100 --> 05:19.100]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[05:19.100 --> 05:23.660]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[05:23.660 --> 05:27.660]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[05:27.660 --> 05:31.460]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[05:31.460 --> 05:35.100]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[05:35.100 --> 05:39.420]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[05:39.420 --> 05:42.580]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[05:42.580 --> 05:46.260]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you

[06:19.380 --> 06:24.140]  are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[06:24.140 --> 06:28.500]  citizens to pay attention full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our

[08:12.700 --> 08:17.700]  we're gonna be breaking down all the different major economic indicators that
[08:17.700 --> 08:23.140]  show that the economy not just of the United States but of every Western
[08:23.140 --> 08:29.220]  nation is in systemic designed freefall here's just one of the reports
[08:29.220 --> 08:36.260]  House majority leader says Greek debt crisis can happen here the United
[08:36.260 --> 08:42.340]  States must embrace a blend of tax increases and spending cuts to rein in
[08:42.340 --> 08:46.860]  its deficit or face a potentially crippling debt crisis like the one in
[08:46.860 --> 08:53.340]  Greece yes all the money must be paid to the bankers we must raise your taxes we
[08:53.340 --> 08:58.220]  must cut your supposed benefits like a third-world nation everything has to go
[08:58.220 --> 09:04.620]  to the bankers the top US lawmaker warned yesterday it's enough to look
[09:04.620 --> 09:10.500]  across the Atlantic at Greece's extreme economic crises and understand it can
[09:10.500 --> 09:14.980]  happen here if we don't change course it will happen here is a Democratic House
[09:14.980 --> 09:21.180]  majority leader Hoyer Hoyer a close White House ally said Democrats and
[09:21.180 --> 09:26.980]  Republicans in the US Congress must take the politically tough decisions yes
[09:26.980 --> 09:32.740]  following their banker master's orders to deflate the ballooning US deficit and
[09:32.740 --> 09:36.780]  tackle record high US debt and they have all these articles in the Washington
[09:36.780 --> 09:40.660]  Post the Washington Times everywhere else that I've looked explaining that
[09:40.660 --> 09:45.380]  Americans are greedy bad people and that Americans don't like the government but
[09:45.380 --> 09:49.420]  why why are they complaining they're getting record amounts of money the
[09:49.420 --> 09:54.300]  American people are getting more money than they are paying in taxes no we're
[09:54.300 --> 09:57.740]  not the offshore banks are getting almost all of it along with the military
[09:57.740 --> 10:02.660]  industrial complex and the ballooning federal and state bureaucracies at every
[10:02.660 --> 10:07.980]  level government's growing and they'll pull a few stunts like in California
[10:07.980 --> 10:13.380]  teachers have to work one day away a week free and DPS workers have to work one
[10:13.380 --> 10:17.860]  day a week free and yes we're gonna shut down part of some national parks and
[10:17.860 --> 10:23.380]  we're not gonna fill potholes see we need more taxes no they need to stop
[10:23.380 --> 10:30.660]  giving trillions of dollars a month a month to private offshore banks that
[10:30.660 --> 10:35.580]  created this scam but they're already positioning it oh we're gonna have a
[10:35.580 --> 10:39.820]  depression we're a year and a half after the bailout we need more bailouts we
[10:39.820 --> 10:43.700]  need to let the banker set up a constitution of the bankers worldwide a
[10:43.700 --> 10:47.340]  world government they've got a they've got to call the shots but don't worry
[10:47.340 --> 10:51.660]  the bankers say they're gonna fix the economy they've got a plan it's called
[10:51.660 --> 10:55.540]  green jobs you lose two jobs for every job it creates and they give the money
[10:55.540 --> 11:00.500]  to select cronies it's a wonderful thing and it'll it'll shut down more power
[11:00.500 --> 11:05.300]  plants and put more taxes on businesses and we're gonna harass all the farmers
[11:05.300 --> 11:09.300]  and ranchers that are barely holding on by their fingernails and and this is
[11:09.300 --> 11:12.700]  gonna be great and China and India and everybody else in the third world and
[11:12.700 --> 11:16.700]  first a developing world they don't have to make any cuts but we do and then
[11:16.700 --> 11:23.620]  this is our plan and it's gonna be great and meanwhile jobless claims up 12% in
[11:23.620 --> 11:27.620]  the last two weeks CNN reports the number of Americans filing for initial
[11:27.620 --> 11:32.780]  unemployment insurance surged just below the 500,000 level last week that's
[11:32.780 --> 11:39.140]  500,000 ladies and gentlemen and have that's a month and have climbed more
[11:39.140 --> 11:44.060]  than 12% over the past two weeks the government said Thursday and these are
[11:44.060 --> 11:47.540]  cooked numbers they don't count you as unemployed once you're off the
[11:47.540 --> 11:51.100]  unemployment rolls and have been refused that for six months to a year and they
[11:51.100 --> 11:56.420]  don't count the underemployed there were 496,000 initial job claims filed the
[11:56.420 --> 12:04.900]  week ended February 20th up 22,000 from a revised 474,000 the previous week
[12:04.900 --> 12:10.020]  amazing the Labor Department said in a weekly report the prior week there were
[12:10.020 --> 12:15.820]  442,000 claims excuse me I read that wrong because last year you would see
[12:15.820 --> 12:24.260]  around 500 to 600,000 a month losing their jobs excuse me I misread this they
[12:24.260 --> 12:35.300]  are now losing 496,000 a week see my mind tends to underestimate things people
[12:35.300 --> 12:39.820]  think I exaggerate generally when I make mistakes my brain plays tricks on me and
[12:39.820 --> 12:44.980]  I underestimate it an article will say the banks just got another two trillion
[12:44.980 --> 12:51.620]  and I'll say two billion because I just the mind cannot process this so excuse
[12:51.620 --> 13:09.660]  me what is four times 496,000 in a month that is just shy of two million jobs
[13:09.660 --> 13:16.220]  what is that like one million eight hundred and something thousand jobs one
[13:16.220 --> 13:29.580]  million eight hundred thousand plus jobs lost in just the last month one
[13:29.580 --> 13:41.740]  million eight hundred thousand oh this is unspeakably bad that's got to be
[13:41.740 --> 13:49.820]  nudging real unemployment up to 25% or close to it I mean in the depths of the
[13:49.820 --> 13:54.980]  depression it was 30% I mean this is unbelievable and back in 2006 we passed
[13:54.980 --> 14:01.340]  the Rubicon and had a higher debt ratio than even in the depths of the
[14:01.340 --> 14:06.140]  depression you like globalism you like NAFTA and GATT well they're saying don't
[14:06.140 --> 14:13.620]  worry we got the next phase of globalism it will get you out of the
[14:13.620 --> 14:23.420]  depression oil gains to around $79 and mixed u.s. data as commodities begin
[14:23.420 --> 14:31.220]  surging gold reaches six-week high gold futures rose on Tuesday pushing prices
[14:31.220 --> 14:34.620]  on the precious metal to the highest of six weeks as US dollar declined
[14:34.620 --> 14:41.700]  increasing the appeal of gold as an investment instrument gold for April
[14:41.700 --> 14:50.540]  delivery rose $4.30 to 1,122 and 30 cents in earlier touched 1,125 50 the
[14:50.540 --> 14:57.700]  highest on a closing basis since January 19th the dollar index which measures
[14:57.700 --> 15:02.780]  the greenback against a trade weighted basket of six major currencies slid to
[15:02.780 --> 15:10.820]  80.607 from 80.753 in late North American trading last night
[15:12.020 --> 15:18.140]  continuing here's this an article out of st. Petersburg Florida and it mirrors
[15:18.140 --> 15:22.260]  what we're seeing all over the nation and all over the world for that matter
[15:22.260 --> 15:28.620]  we're all under the same groups control Medicare payment reductions worry
[15:28.620 --> 15:33.660]  doctors and patients March begins with a financial blow for doctors we're
[15:33.660 --> 15:38.060]  facing a major reduction in Medicare payments the 21% reduction is the
[15:38.060 --> 15:42.220]  result of what some say is an outdated reimbursement formula from the 1990s
[15:42.220 --> 15:46.060]  over the years Congress managed to waive the deficit reduction measure but
[15:46.060 --> 15:53.740]  legislatures failed to repeal it last week so 21% cut in the payments with
[15:56.660 --> 16:03.540]  with funds that are absolutely essential in Medicare and the news just
[16:03.540 --> 16:09.060]  continues on from there I just want to mention this for a run out of time
[16:09.060 --> 16:13.860]  because Ray McGovern's coming up here in about 15 minutes I was surfing
[16:13.860 --> 16:19.140]  around on the internet or internet says Bush would say this morning and I
[16:19.140 --> 16:24.100]  tried to go over to a blog spot article headlined will Larry pull it
[16:24.100 --> 16:31.340]  Silverstein will Mr. Larry pull it Silverstein did you commit insurance
[16:31.340 --> 16:36.500]  fraud on 9 11 and it's a pretty good article but I noticed when I tried it
[16:36.500 --> 16:40.900]  when I tried to go to the link to the blog spot it said this is a message in
[16:40.900 --> 16:45.100]  fact I sent that to you Jeremy did you get the message out may not have been
[16:45.100 --> 16:49.140]  clear I wanted you to print the message that they put up on blog spot first or
[16:49.140 --> 16:58.460]  maybe try to go to this from an outside link and it says on there that Google
[16:58.460 --> 17:04.060]  has listed this as possibly dangerous information are you sure you want to go
[17:04.060 --> 17:08.500]  to this and then you go to it it's an article about Larry Silverstein getting
[17:08.500 --> 17:12.580]  all this insurance in the World Trade Centers and building seven and the fact
[17:12.580 --> 17:16.380]  that he got a record insurance policy and a double insurance policy and how
[17:16.380 --> 17:20.460]  suspicious the whole thing is and how on a hundred and fifty million dollar
[17:20.460 --> 17:27.700]  investment he made over nine billion and no no no you can't go to that or you
[17:27.700 --> 17:31.980]  better be careful when you go to that because it's so dangerous it's so evil
[17:31.980 --> 17:38.020]  just another example of more and more attempts at internet censorship and
[17:38.020 --> 17:41.300]  intimidating people away from alternative information that are going on
[17:41.300 --> 17:46.020]  coming up later in the broadcast Supreme Court waive Chicago strict gun
[17:46.020 --> 17:52.540]  ban justice is here second amendment case right to have a gun at home but it
[17:52.540 --> 17:56.020]  says that handgun control incorporated in others and the Justice Department are
[17:56.020 --> 17:59.620]  hopeful because they think the Supreme Court is going to rule okay you have a
[17:59.620 --> 18:03.660]  right to own firearms in Chicago and New York where they're basically banned for
[18:03.660 --> 18:08.380]  the general public but you make lucrative payments to the sheriff who will
[18:08.380 --> 18:12.300]  then in a few cases let you have a concealed weapons permit mainly
[18:12.300 --> 18:15.780]  Goldman Sachs employees that came out of the ones that get it some cases they
[18:15.780 --> 18:19.540]  pay more than thirty thousand dollars in campaign donations to get just one like
[18:19.540 --> 18:24.900]  buying a nice new car but they say oh the court though is set probably we're
[18:24.900 --> 18:29.180]  thinking according to court watchers and experts to rule yes you have an
[18:29.180 --> 18:34.100]  individual right but we have a right to restrict that right so more orwellian
[18:34.100 --> 18:41.980]  double-speak and then last week I saw a report out of the Ninth Circuit Court of
[18:41.980 --> 18:45.940]  Appeals the presiding Chief Justice said it was a total police state into the
[18:45.940 --> 18:50.420]  fourth amendment that police can now go into your house without a warrant without
[18:50.420 --> 18:55.820]  even having suspicion that a crime has been committed and that dovetails with
[18:55.820 --> 19:07.620]  a Seattle Times article today no curbs on border searches of cell phones
[19:07.620 --> 19:12.580]  laptops of US citizens and the LA Times had an article last week we covered
[19:12.580 --> 19:17.900]  where they mainly focus on citizens business people and now foreign
[19:17.900 --> 19:20.900]  governments are doing this as well and sometimes they keep your laptop for six
[19:20.900 --> 19:25.100]  weeks or longer your cell phone and they take it and they download everything
[19:25.100 --> 19:29.900]  off of it and then say on your way no fourth amendment no nothing and it says
[19:29.900 --> 19:36.620]  here that the US Customs and Border Protection says yes we don't need any
[19:36.620 --> 19:42.380]  suspicion of wrongdoing it says without first establishing suspicion of
[19:42.380 --> 19:47.620]  wrongdoing and the precedents they set in airports and on the border are what
[19:47.620 --> 19:54.100]  they then roll out in the general public so just rapidly becoming a bonafide

[28:15.220 --> 28:19.020]  clear that agents at airports and borders can look into your electronic

[35:35.100 --> 35:42.300]  Ray McGovern also has been exposing a lot of the things that the government's
[35:42.300 --> 35:47.700]  been doing some of the stage crises that they use to expand wars and tyranny and
[35:47.700 --> 35:51.620]  I wanted to get him on on a host of issues today Ray good to have you back
[35:51.620 --> 35:56.300]  with us thank you Alex good to be with you so much is going on but out of the
[35:56.300 --> 36:00.180]  gates before we get into terrorists working for our government staging attacks
[36:00.180 --> 36:06.940]  overseas open discussions of assassinating US citizens abroad Barack Obama
[36:06.940 --> 36:11.660]  you've been hopeful that there would be a shift away from the neocons now we
[36:11.660 --> 36:16.740]  hear continued talk of new wars expanded wars continuing torture he
[36:16.740 --> 36:21.540]  reauthorized the Patriot Act who is Barack Obama are you disappointed and
[36:21.540 --> 36:27.660]  who's really running the White House good question who is Barack Obama I did
[36:27.660 --> 36:34.460]  have I did have some expectations which have been dashed I don't mean on the
[36:34.460 --> 36:40.740]  Middle East and right into the Israeli Arab dispute at the conflict there he
[36:40.740 --> 36:44.100]  offered some hope that he would take a more realistic view as matter of fact
[36:44.100 --> 36:49.100]  major speech he said these Israel no more settlements on the occupied
[36:49.100 --> 36:55.900]  territories no ifs ands or buts no more settlements and Netanyahu took his thumb
[36:55.900 --> 37:01.140]  and his other fingers and you know thumbed his nose at Barack Obama and
[37:01.140 --> 37:06.380]  said oh yeah by the way we've stopped working on this this little part of
[37:06.380 --> 37:10.260]  your Easter result but now we're we're gonna do a new settlement at this hill
[37:10.260 --> 37:16.860]  of that hill so for Barack Obama after a year in office to tell I guess it was a
[37:16.860 --> 37:25.340]  time reporter in this plaintiff plaintiff tone gee you know I I I didn't
[37:25.340 --> 37:29.700]  think that the Arab is really thing with was so intractable that they both
[37:29.700 --> 37:35.700]  that is so stubborn it's as though he has no leverage you know and you know
[37:35.700 --> 37:41.060]  three billion dollars a year from your tax tax money in mind that they give to
[37:41.060 --> 37:46.020]  Israel every year that doesn't give any leverage give me a break so Mike my
[37:46.020 --> 37:53.500]  major my major fear right now Alex is is that the Netanyahu has to look on this
[37:53.500 --> 37:58.860]  Obama character as a real was you know a real captive of the Israel lobby in this
[37:58.860 --> 38:04.220]  country and so what's to prevent Netanyahu from starting a war with Iran
[38:04.220 --> 38:11.100]  with the full expectation that Congress will vote as it usually does at 492 to
[38:11.100 --> 38:18.540]  three in favor of you know defending our quote ally and I use quotation marks
[38:18.540 --> 38:25.540]  because an ally is a country with which another country has a defense agreement
[38:25.540 --> 38:29.980]  and there is no mutual defense agreement between Israel and the United States
[38:29.980 --> 38:34.460]  and that's more than just the technicality that does not apply just to
[38:34.460 --> 38:39.180]  go to war if Israel provokes a war with Iran well Ryan McGovern you were one of
[38:39.180 --> 38:43.700]  the chief analyst in the morning raffer for Ronald Reagan George Bush senior I
[38:43.700 --> 38:48.380]  mean if you were there sitting in front of the president today i.e. the American
[38:48.380 --> 38:52.300]  people you're speaking to right now what's the word with all your
[38:52.300 --> 38:56.220]  intelligence sources and also just analyzing the full spectrum we see
[38:56.220 --> 39:00.300]  Ahmed Enigides saying they plan Israel plans to attack in the spring or
[39:00.300 --> 39:04.260]  summer we see the communist Chinese saying you know they're basically
[39:04.260 --> 39:13.580]  girding for conflict with the United States we see Russia now becoming more
[39:13.580 --> 39:20.460]  and more angry at what the West is doing we see John Kerry dispatched to Israel
[39:20.460 --> 39:27.940]  in the speech say look don't attack let us just do crippling sanctions what are
[39:27.940 --> 39:32.260]  the chances they are gonna launch a war what will it look like are we in real
[39:32.260 --> 39:38.980]  danger right now it all depends in my view Alex on how innocent Yahoo and his
[39:38.980 --> 39:47.700]  cohorts there in Tel Aviv view Obama the incredible traveling back and forth
[39:47.700 --> 39:54.100]  that between Washington and Tel Aviv you have the CIA head you have the the
[39:54.100 --> 39:58.740]  national security advisor you have the defense secretary you have you have the
[39:58.740 --> 40:03.180]  chairman of the joint chiefs of staff at you know it never stops Biden is so
[40:03.180 --> 40:07.740]  either there or going there this week something's being planned well you know
[40:07.740 --> 40:13.020]  it seems to me that what's happening is what happened a year and a half ago when
[40:13.020 --> 40:18.580]  Admiral Bowen just named joint chief of staff chairman went to Israel and he
[40:18.580 --> 40:26.100]  said look we don't want a war with Iran so stop listening to Elliot Abrams and
[40:26.100 --> 40:31.420]  Dick Cheney I'm the head of the US Armed Forces and I don't want you to provoke
[40:31.420 --> 40:36.340]  war now listen to me listen I'm a naval officer okay I know what happened on
[40:36.340 --> 40:42.380]  June 8th 1967 when you try to sink one of our ships okay that's not gonna happen
[40:42.380 --> 40:46.860]  again so don't even think of it now that was amazing Alex because that was the
[40:46.860 --> 40:51.900]  first time any senior statesman any senior military officer ever raised the
[40:51.900 --> 40:57.620]  USS Liberty incident with the Israelis he read on the riot act and it worked at
[40:57.620 --> 41:03.420]  a time when Cheney and Bush were were watching the juggernaut toward war
[41:03.420 --> 41:07.740]  against Iran and the other thing that helps of course in those days that was
[41:07.740 --> 41:13.380]  the sensible US intelligence estimate that said and most people forget this
[41:13.380 --> 41:18.900]  the estimate said yeah Iran had been working on the weapons part of a
[41:18.900 --> 41:25.940]  nuclear program up until the fall of 2003 and then they stopped and we say
[41:25.940 --> 41:34.620]  that with with great great confidence now whether they've resumed between 2003
[41:34.620 --> 41:40.100]  and 2007 when the estimate came out we're not sure but we have reasonable
[41:40.100 --> 41:44.340]  confidence that they have not started that again well Ray I saw that in the
[41:44.340 --> 41:47.740]  paper when it happened and I don't want to just glaze over it that's an important
[41:47.740 --> 41:51.980]  point you raised a few minutes ago that I really kind of forgotten about it gone
[41:51.980 --> 41:56.540]  in the memory hole that Admiral Mullen and I saw it in the Jerusalem Post said
[41:56.540 --> 42:02.540]  don't stage an event like the USS Liberty I mean that was an amazing
[42:02.540 --> 42:07.100]  statement by a top military officer of don't launch a false flag and I remember
[42:07.100 --> 42:13.140]  you almost four years ago on this show saying I think Cheney will try to stage
[42:13.140 --> 42:17.220]  a Gulf of Tonkin near the Strait of Hormuz and then a year and a half later
[42:17.220 --> 42:21.100]  it came out that right around that time Sy Hirsch reported MSNBC it was
[42:21.100 --> 42:26.940]  confirmed what wanted to have US Navy SEALs attack US destroyers as a stage
[42:26.940 --> 42:30.620]  provocation looks like they only did the fake radio transmission but that wasn't
[42:30.620 --> 42:36.980]  enough and in the the Admiralty is as it goes didn't didn't bite and and Fox
[42:36.980 --> 42:41.940]  Fallon didn't a Fallon didn't bite on it so so flesh that out for people in
[42:41.940 --> 42:46.660]  layman's terms what it means to have a top military officer go to the Israelis
[42:46.660 --> 42:49.060]  and say look don't stage an event
[42:49.060 --> 42:54.660]  mm-hmm well it's good that you pointed out Sy Hirsch is reporting because he
[42:54.660 --> 42:59.420]  also reported that Dick Cheney had proposed and I don't know how far this
[42:59.420 --> 43:05.500]  got but proposed a painting PT boats or you know these swift boats with Iranian
[43:05.500 --> 43:10.580]  colors and having them dropped off by the Israelis in the Persian Gulf and
[43:10.580 --> 43:16.620]  created incident that way so all this is very real and there's a distinction I
[43:16.620 --> 43:21.660]  would make between what one did a year and a half ago and what he did just
[43:21.660 --> 43:27.260]  less well two weeks ago is this now he's sounding like please please don't
[43:27.260 --> 43:32.340]  start an attack it wouldn't be good I don't yeah it's on the table an attack
[43:32.340 --> 43:36.900]  is on the table never mind Alex that it's you know a war crime to attack the
[43:36.900 --> 43:41.140]  country that hasn't attacked you or has no capability of attacking you it's still
[43:41.140 --> 43:46.860]  on the table but please pretty please you know it would really be nice so the
[43:46.860 --> 43:51.500]  tone has changed it's not a kind of a forward look we know what you're up to
[43:51.500 --> 43:57.220]  don't even think of it now it's we know what you're up to but please please
[43:57.220 --> 44:01.660]  this would really create quite a mess and so that this concerns me that really
[44:01.660 --> 44:06.500]  worries me because you know mullen has been pretty when he had when he had
[44:06.500 --> 44:11.220]  fallen out there also than you know things were we're pretty hard nose in
[44:11.220 --> 44:15.260]  the military does not want to get involved with war with Iran because
[44:15.260 --> 44:19.820]  they know it would be a catastrophe I at the end of this article I wrote you
[44:19.820 --> 44:26.500]  know I compared Iraq and Afghanistan you know in light of a of a war with Iran
[44:26.500 --> 44:32.300]  well Iran would make the war with Iraq and Afghanistan look like you know a
[44:32.300 --> 44:37.060]  girl's volleyball a match between Mount Sinosla and Holy Name Academy you know
[44:37.060 --> 44:42.940]  that's how bad it would be so what's the word in Washington with all your
[44:42.940 --> 44:46.820]  sources I mean clearly they're trying to sell a war we see it all over the
[44:46.820 --> 44:52.820]  newspapers it's being pushed I mean what are the chances statistically or dead
[44:52.820 --> 44:57.020]  reckoning that they are gonna launch an attack what will that attack look like
[44:57.020 --> 45:04.500]  and what will the aftermath be well I would not exclude the Israelis doing
[45:04.500 --> 45:12.980]  what they did on the 9th of June 1967 the day after the attack on the USS
[45:12.980 --> 45:16.820]  Liberty that's when they went up on the Golan and took the Golan Heights from
[45:16.820 --> 45:23.140]  Syria now why do I compare that to these days well the US ambassador the people
[45:23.140 --> 45:26.860]  in Washington they were all over the Israeli leaders say no now okay all right
[45:26.860 --> 45:31.260]  you took you took the side it took off please please don't go up but don't go
[45:31.260 --> 45:35.140]  up on the Golan but he'd say that would not get you involved in a war with
[45:35.140 --> 45:39.940]  don't do that okay and of course they had every intention of doing that and one
[45:39.940 --> 45:44.060]  of the reasons I believe that they tried to sink the Liberty it's because the
[45:44.060 --> 45:49.020]  Liberty was in position to intercept communications without which the
[45:49.020 --> 45:52.860]  Israelis couldn't do Golan okay so they were sure the US was going to point out
[45:52.860 --> 45:57.260]  about it and therefore they thought they would nip the nip it in the bud there
[45:57.260 --> 46:02.500]  by taking a ship in any case the situation is very similar now because
[46:02.500 --> 46:07.620]  there's no guarantee that the Israelis won't go ahead with the full expectation
[46:07.620 --> 46:12.100]  that a lopsided vote in Congress and in the administration I mean look who's
[46:12.100 --> 46:16.420]  running the place is ramen manual now it's always credit you know he's a very
[46:16.420 --> 46:20.740]  patriotic guy and you know when the balloon went up in the first Gulf War he
[46:20.740 --> 46:25.340]  immediately rejoined the army most people don't realize that it was the
[46:25.340 --> 46:31.620]  Israeli army that they joined and for all I know he's still a reservist in the
[46:31.620 --> 46:36.460]  Israeli army probably an intelligence now he's running a White House give me a
[46:36.460 --> 46:42.460]  break so we have a bunch of people who as I've said before have great
[46:42.460 --> 46:46.860]  difficulty distinguishing between what they believe to be the strategic
[46:46.860 --> 46:52.780]  necessities of Israel vis-à-vis the strategic needs of our own country and
[46:52.780 --> 46:57.140]  that is is the kind of situation that George Washington himself our first
[46:57.140 --> 47:01.700]  president warned about when he talked about passionate attachments of one
[47:01.700 --> 47:08.100]  country to the perceived needs of another absolutely when he was of course
[47:08.100 --> 47:12.380]  first president they burned evasives of him all over the country the French
[47:12.380 --> 47:16.700]  tried to foam in a rebellion in the US because he would not authorize a new
[47:16.700 --> 47:20.820]  war against the British he said no we want our independence and our freedoms
[47:20.820 --> 47:26.580]  not to be in an imperial alliance with the French and these entangling
[47:26.580 --> 47:30.500]  alliances are not what we need to do and that's what built America but but
[47:30.500 --> 47:34.780]  what's wrong with Israel I mean I'm no geopolitical wizard but I can look at
[47:34.780 --> 47:39.860]  the pieces it really isn't in Israel's interest they know Iran doesn't have
[47:39.860 --> 47:46.500]  nukes Iran even tried to buy the uranium for the power plants from France a
[47:46.500 --> 47:52.700]  few months ago which proves it wasn't to be used in weapons why does Israel want
[47:52.700 --> 48:02.820]  to attack Iran it's the last the last bastion of the of support for people who
[48:02.820 --> 48:11.420]  in in Israel's eyes endanger the state of Israel it is true that Iran affords a
[48:11.420 --> 48:19.340]  lot of help to Hamas and Hamas and Gaza and and his fallah in Lebanon now these
[48:19.340 --> 48:24.660]  have been branded terrorists their organizations by the US but what they're
[48:24.660 --> 48:29.580]  mostly they're so popular because they help the common people the poor people
[48:29.580 --> 48:35.060]  and they do have terrorist wings now these terrorists can wreak havoc on
[48:35.060 --> 48:39.500]  Israel and that's why Israel is doing all this pre-emptive stuff including
[48:39.500 --> 48:48.340]  killing 14,000 guys with mostly civilians at the turn of a year ago so so
[48:48.340 --> 48:54.060]  Israelis would like to take advantage of the opportunity to raise this or should
[48:54.060 --> 49:01.220]  we call it this pretext of Iran becoming close to a nuclear weapon to do in
[49:01.220 --> 49:06.860]  the regime there and to do were to make Iran the kind of basket case that they
[49:06.860 --> 49:12.260]  succeeded in getting the Bush administration to make Iraq into and
[49:12.260 --> 49:17.260]  we've seen a lot of different breakdowns by analysts of what will happen if Iran
[49:17.260 --> 49:21.660]  is attacked all of the scenarios are bad but they go from bad to worse briefly
[49:21.660 --> 49:26.460]  what will happen if Iran is bombarded one of the things they'll do and this
[49:26.460 --> 49:31.980]  will hurt most Americans is mine the streets of four moves and that you know
[49:31.980 --> 49:36.980]  through those through that straight straight of almost go I think 40% of
[49:36.980 --> 49:42.580]  the exported oil to the rest of the world so you talk about Japan China talk
[49:42.580 --> 49:45.900]  about some really interesting and a powerful countries that would be
[49:45.900 --> 49:51.820]  affected by this not to mention US people at the gas pump now Admiral
[49:51.820 --> 49:57.340]  Mullen was asked two and a half years ago well couldn't the Iranians blockade
[49:57.340 --> 50:01.980]  the straight there and he swallowed hard he said yeah they could but but we could
[50:01.980 --> 50:08.380]  take it back within no within within three days probably well right well how
[50:08.380 --> 50:11.740]  you gonna take it back Admiral Mullen you're gonna send the Marines to scale
[50:11.740 --> 50:15.860]  those to those clips we're gonna get the Marines from
[50:15.860 --> 50:19.900]  Admiral Mullen you can take them out again if there aren't any Marines is
[50:19.900 --> 50:24.340]  and so you know the situation and the Iranians aren't the Iraqis I mean they
[50:24.340 --> 50:28.660]  really are gonna have focused sustained counter attacks and from what I've
[50:28.660 --> 50:32.140]  read all they've got to do is not mine it they'll sink a bunch of ships there
[50:32.140 --> 50:35.740]  and you're not gonna get that out in a month sure they could do that and you
[50:35.740 --> 50:40.260]  know they have all these little little boats with the rocket punches on them and
[50:40.260 --> 50:44.980]  they have coastal defense things that won't quit these big US ships in the
[50:44.980 --> 50:51.820]  Persian Gulf are sitting ducks frankly they're not if I were maybe I get them
[50:51.820 --> 50:57.460]  out of there and and not make them sit what is it 13,000 sunburned missiles
[50:57.460 --> 51:02.020]  that can hit all our ships we'll be right back with right now for safety you

[51:44.380 --> 51:47.060]  greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army
[51:47.060 --> 51:50.660]  hi Ted Anderson I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary
[51:50.660 --> 51:56.060]  system call for your copy 800-686-2237 it's time to understand the system call
[51:56.060 --> 52:04.220]  800-686-2237 that's 800-686-2237 hundreds of nations have fallen to
[52:04.220 --> 52:09.500]  tyranny in the last century alone this is our last chance to not relive history
[52:09.500 --> 52:13.620]  as they're finishing off this agenda they'll be pulling the rug from underneath
[52:13.620 --> 52:19.300]  Americans at home turn menace influence on our president in Congress and they
[52:19.300 --> 52:24.420]  really are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[52:24.420 --> 52:28.780]  citizens to pay attention for the republic identifies the enemies of our

[54:10.380 --> 54:18.020]  planet dot TV with Mike Rivera ladies and gentlemen I've seen all these big
[54:18.020 --> 54:23.380]  statements out of the State Department and many others that this is one of the
[54:23.380 --> 54:27.500]  most critical times in world history in the last 200 years Henry Kissinger has
[54:27.500 --> 54:31.980]  said that everything is coming together like a perfect storm like we saw in the
[54:31.980 --> 54:37.540]  lead-up World War one World War two the world economy is plunging the banks are
[54:37.540 --> 54:43.340]  looting they need a political distraction like a war Israel wants a war now you
[54:43.340 --> 54:47.460]  have all that coming together in a perfect storm how do we avert this we
[54:47.460 --> 54:51.180]  were finishing up with Ray McGovern on the subject of what Iran would do
[54:51.180 --> 54:56.940]  certainly Ray they wouldn't stop just with closing the Strait of Hormuz would
[54:56.940 --> 55:02.940]  they know I think that you know they have so many options it's really hard
[55:02.940 --> 55:06.620]  to predict I mean one of the things they could do is close all kinds of
[55:06.620 --> 55:13.540]  casualties in any rock they could do the same in Afghanistan they could shoot a
[55:13.540 --> 55:18.340]  couple rockets into Israel and some people believe that they could destroy
[55:18.340 --> 55:24.540]  the Israeli weapons reactor in Devona so you know it the Israelis can't be really
[55:24.540 --> 55:31.460]  clear about what would happen unless they enlist the US to be at the ready if
[55:31.460 --> 55:36.580]  at one they decide to attack I think that's a lot of their concern though
[55:36.580 --> 55:41.060]  even the Israeli concern is kind of like a synthetic one as manufactured
[55:41.060 --> 55:46.300]  concern they're whipping up this hysteria even how the Iranians poor souls
[55:46.300 --> 55:50.500]  having all kinds of trouble trying to enrich the uranium even to to work in a
[55:50.500 --> 55:55.260]  nuclear reactor for electricity they're whipping up this hysteria because it's
[55:55.260 --> 56:01.220]  something that the US citizens can be sold on just like before Iraq now one of
[56:01.220 --> 56:04.980]  the things that's really curious is here's here's Hillary Clinton our our
[56:04.980 --> 56:12.860]  Secretary of State out there and in Doha out there the United Arab Emirates and
[56:12.860 --> 56:19.420]  she's saying you know we recognize that Iran is not a threat to the United
[56:19.420 --> 56:25.580]  States but it is a threat to our friends and allies now for that read Israel and
[56:25.580 --> 56:34.060]  so you know why how is it a threat well if it got one one nuclear weapon you know
[56:34.060 --> 56:39.660]  I'll be real threat to an existential threat to Israel which only has between
[56:39.660 --> 56:46.900]  two hundred three hundred deliverable by rocket by under the sea by they will
[56:46.900 --> 56:51.420]  wear grip you know you name it deliverable in all kinds of ways so it's
[56:51.420 --> 56:57.060]  real stretch you know despite the you know the paranoia or the
[56:57.060 --> 57:01.940]  means Pakistan's got quite a few nukes and medium-range delivery systems yeah
[57:01.940 --> 57:07.700]  well even you know my friend Robert Gates who was nominated to be Defense
[57:07.700 --> 57:15.020]  Secretary right there in that 2000 and and for I guess at the well my six is
[57:15.020 --> 57:20.780]  what after the terrible election for the Republicans you know when he was asked
[57:20.780 --> 57:27.140]  by some one of the people one of the actually is to call 11 the head of the
[57:27.140 --> 57:32.660]  arms services committee and Senate he said mr. Gates tell me why would it tell
[57:32.660 --> 57:38.100]  me just tell me why would he run I want to happen to clear weapons and Gates I
[57:38.100 --> 57:43.380]  guess thinking more as an analyst breath and the politicians as well I look at
[57:43.380 --> 57:49.380]  the map they're surrounded by countries that have nuclear weapons is Pakistan
[57:49.380 --> 57:58.100]  it's Russia it's Israel Turkey and Turkey and well we've got nukes there
[57:58.100 --> 58:02.420]  yeah but and then in the Persian Gulf at the U.S. so they're surrounded
[58:02.420 --> 58:12.420]  Pakistan Russia Israel and the U.S. and Persian Gulf well because Gates should
[58:12.420 --> 58:15.820]  have known that it's not politically correct to mention Israel in this
[58:15.820 --> 58:20.980]  connection okay but he did and of course that's the sensible sensible look
[58:20.980 --> 58:25.340]  look at the right look at from their point of view they're named one of the
[58:25.340 --> 58:33.060]  three axis of axes of easel okay now what happens to North Korea they have a
[58:33.060 --> 58:37.620]  bomb nothing what happens to Iraq they all have a bomb they get a bomb they're

[1:00:23.100 --> 1:00:27.020]  we have the son of one of the top your gun terrorists that blew up british
[1:00:27.020 --> 1:00:34.900]  military bases and villages of arabs in palestine and israel he's basically in
[1:00:34.900 --> 1:00:39.940]  their running a white house is open israeli officer he's their advising
[1:00:39.940 --> 1:00:45.100]  obama i was talking to uh... you're right about chances of them attacking iran
[1:00:45.100 --> 1:00:49.780]  all i mean i'll ask him that on air but if you were there talking to obama if
[1:00:49.780 --> 1:00:53.620]  you could have an hour with obama what would be the first thing you said to
[1:00:53.620 --> 1:00:56.340]  him rama govern
[1:00:56.340 --> 1:01:00.180]  you know this kind of thing is not impossible let me let me go back a
[1:01:00.180 --> 1:01:04.900]  couple years and tell you that i met senator john warner might distinguish
[1:01:04.900 --> 1:01:08.540]  senator from virginia at a concert okay
[1:01:08.540 --> 1:01:11.740]  he was walking alone outside and i said to my wife all
[1:01:11.740 --> 1:01:13.620]  it's a great chance i went out there
[1:01:13.620 --> 1:01:16.700]  and introduced myself as the fellow that gave him
[1:01:16.700 --> 1:01:19.500]  gave up my seat at the bolshoi ballet
[1:01:19.500 --> 1:01:23.660]  uh... when he came to sign agreements on disarmament back in nineteen seventy
[1:01:23.660 --> 1:01:28.300]  two but he said oh you're the world so we we have a little comradery there
[1:01:28.300 --> 1:01:31.580]  and as we walk back into the the crowd there
[1:01:31.580 --> 1:01:36.380]  he's hanging on to my onto my arm and i said you know senator warner you really
[1:01:36.380 --> 1:01:39.980]  ought to look into why they hate us why they really hate us
[1:01:39.980 --> 1:01:45.500]  and he turned to me he said oh why is that and i said because they identify us
[1:01:45.500 --> 1:01:48.860]  specifically and exclusively with the state of israel
[1:01:48.860 --> 1:01:52.540]  and the kinds of oppression that israel's doing in the middle east
[1:01:52.540 --> 1:01:59.500]  now his grip on my arm alex was like a vice he cut off the circulation
[1:01:59.500 --> 1:02:05.260]  and and and he said well i don't know what we could do about that
[1:02:05.260 --> 1:02:09.180]  and i looked at him and i said holy moses is a guy
[1:02:09.180 --> 1:02:12.780]  last term in the senate uh... he's been around a long time and he
[1:02:12.780 --> 1:02:18.380]  he he panics he grabs my it cuts off the blood circulation my left arm and says
[1:02:18.380 --> 1:02:21.340]  oh i don't know if we could do anything about that and there it is so what i
[1:02:21.340 --> 1:02:24.140]  would do to obama is grab his arm and say look
[1:02:24.140 --> 1:02:27.900]  brock you're surrounded by people who don't have
[1:02:27.900 --> 1:02:31.500]  the interests of the united states primary in mind
[1:02:31.500 --> 1:02:36.940]  but this uh... iran thing is a cockamamie way to do the kind of regime change
[1:02:36.940 --> 1:02:40.540]  that uh... bush and cheney did in iraq
[1:02:40.540 --> 1:02:44.060]  face up to obama or else just go away because you're
[1:02:44.060 --> 1:02:47.660]  terrible disappointment the way you cave into all these
[1:02:47.660 --> 1:02:54.300]  crooks that's what i'd say to obama plus there's the ramifications i've seen a
[1:02:54.300 --> 1:02:57.980]  lot of top analysts saying this could trigger a world war three type
[1:02:57.980 --> 1:03:02.380]  of scenario or bare minimum of wider conflict there's a lot of other regimes
[1:03:02.380 --> 1:03:06.780]  around the world that on both sides are on different sides on their own side
[1:03:06.780 --> 1:03:11.180]  who may take an attack on iran knowing we're totally overextended
[1:03:11.180 --> 1:03:15.340]  as a chance to start new wars and and and take over other areas
[1:03:15.340 --> 1:03:19.260]  well not only that but the iranians have a kind of terrorist system that
[1:03:19.260 --> 1:03:22.220]  you know makes al qaeda look like a grammar school
[1:03:22.220 --> 1:03:26.060]  uh... they can cause all kinds of troubles here in this country as well
[1:03:26.060 --> 1:03:31.180]  so you know it's really it's really necessary for this word to get out
[1:03:31.180 --> 1:03:35.180]  and what i call the the fawning corporate media halux
[1:03:35.180 --> 1:03:38.140]  uh... the mass media in this country
[1:03:38.140 --> 1:03:42.860]  tv radio owned by the kind of corporations that are profiting from
[1:03:42.860 --> 1:03:45.900]  wars such as we have any rock in afghanistan
[1:03:45.900 --> 1:03:49.820]  and god forbid you be run they don't know which end is up they don't care
[1:03:49.820 --> 1:03:52.780]  about u.s soldiers perishing in these wars
[1:03:52.780 --> 1:03:58.220]  all they care about is to disguise the real roots of these wars
[1:03:58.220 --> 1:04:01.340]  and one thing i'll just add to this calculus
[1:04:01.340 --> 1:04:04.620]  today there's a washington post-tenageric
[1:04:04.620 --> 1:04:10.460]  uh... you know a very laudatory uh... exposition on ramen manual
[1:04:10.460 --> 1:04:14.460]  uh... the reason that barack obama is foundering is because he hasn't
[1:04:14.460 --> 1:04:18.620]  heated ramen manuals advice that's the whole point of this thing
[1:04:18.620 --> 1:04:23.340]  written by uh... one of their neocon writers okay now in the midst of this
[1:04:23.340 --> 1:04:25.740]  thing it turns out that ramen manual
[1:04:25.740 --> 1:04:28.620]  was first and foremost among those that said
[1:04:28.620 --> 1:04:33.420]  you can't try halichik muhammad in a civilian court
[1:04:33.420 --> 1:04:37.340]  now he wants him to try it in the military court why is that
[1:04:37.340 --> 1:04:40.380]  well you know why that is because halichik muhammad
[1:04:40.380 --> 1:04:44.300]  when he was asked when he's first apprehended why he did what he did in
[1:04:44.300 --> 1:04:49.260]  master mining 9-11 he said because of my my extreme hatred
[1:04:49.260 --> 1:04:53.900]  for u.s policy favoring israel that's going to come out in a civilian court
[1:04:53.900 --> 1:04:57.420]  ramen manual and the other eucons don't want to stay there
[1:04:57.420 --> 1:05:01.740]  let's let's talk about your article the good terrorist

[1:08:48.780 --> 1:08:51.900]  we're going to be getting into the economy the police state and a lot more
[1:08:51.900 --> 1:08:55.020]  the attack on the internet that's taking place the transformation of our
[1:08:55.020 --> 1:08:59.500]  republic into a first rate banana republic
[1:08:59.500 --> 1:09:03.340]  but uh going back to rame mcgovern
[1:09:03.340 --> 1:09:09.820]  here uh ray shifting gears just into uh the policies
[1:09:09.820 --> 1:09:13.500]  that our nation has really now openly adopted
[1:09:13.500 --> 1:09:17.340]  uh what three years ago four years ago bush put out a press release from the
[1:09:17.340 --> 1:09:19.900]  white house saying oh we're funding these four
[1:09:19.900 --> 1:09:24.460]  patriot groups inside iran three of them tied to al qaeda one of them commanded
[1:09:24.460 --> 1:09:27.340]  by the number three in al qaeda and i remember
[1:09:27.340 --> 1:09:31.020]  years ago you talk about the golden mosque in iraq being bombed
[1:09:31.020 --> 1:09:34.620]  by uh western forces to get the sunnis and shiites killing each other that
[1:09:34.620 --> 1:09:38.860]  later came out that that was the case uh i mean this is standard operating
[1:09:38.860 --> 1:09:45.180]  procedure and you wrote an article titled a good terrorist captured by iran
[1:09:45.180 --> 1:09:49.500]  for counter punch break down the type of uh
[1:09:49.500 --> 1:09:53.420]  covert operations the black ops the false flags
[1:09:53.420 --> 1:09:56.220]  uh that are being launched to get us to iran because from
[1:09:56.220 --> 1:09:59.980]  all this evidence in the white house admitting it no bomb continuing it
[1:09:59.980 --> 1:10:06.380]  iran has been incredibly restrained in in putting up with this and not responding
[1:10:06.380 --> 1:10:10.140]  well they had to be a piece of luck because they had captured one of the
[1:10:10.140 --> 1:10:15.180]  good terrorists now as is well known there are good terrorists and there are
[1:10:15.180 --> 1:10:19.180]  bad terrorists the bad ones are the bad guys the good ones are the ones that we
[1:10:19.180 --> 1:10:22.780]  fund to the tune of four hundred million dollars
[1:10:22.780 --> 1:10:27.420]  can you imagine four hundred million bucks for covert operation you can do a
[1:10:27.420 --> 1:10:29.980]  lot of stuff with four hundred million dollars
[1:10:29.980 --> 1:10:34.220]  and one of the uh one of the terrorist organizations that seems to
[1:10:34.220 --> 1:10:37.980]  be acquiring some of this large s our tax money
[1:10:37.980 --> 1:10:41.580]  as a as a violent organization called college with
[1:10:41.580 --> 1:10:46.860]  dollar now people have to realize that almost half the population in iran is
[1:10:46.860 --> 1:10:49.980]  minorities okay you have the isaries you have the
[1:10:49.980 --> 1:10:54.940]  bullies you have the Kurds only about 51 percent are actually Persians so
[1:10:54.940 --> 1:10:59.260]  so there's a fertile field for causing trouble and putting the regime off
[1:10:59.260 --> 1:11:03.100]  balance well they they caught this one fella and
[1:11:03.100 --> 1:11:06.940]  his claim to fame was running uh this uh Jodhalla
[1:11:06.940 --> 1:11:10.220]  which is not only harassing everyone at ken
[1:11:10.220 --> 1:11:15.740]  not only tried to assassinate Ahmadinejad but also can be used in this
[1:11:15.740 --> 1:11:21.660]  manner on october 1st last year there was a breakthrough agreement
[1:11:21.660 --> 1:11:27.820]  that shocked everyone for the first time a high level
[1:11:27.820 --> 1:11:34.940]  negotiator that is it was the undersecretary of state was sent to
[1:11:34.940 --> 1:11:38.940]  talk with the Iranians together with the europeans about the Iranian nuclear
[1:11:38.940 --> 1:11:43.900]  problem and the proposal was hey why don't you send
[1:11:43.900 --> 1:11:48.860]  75 percent of your low-enriched uranium uh to Russia and to France and we'll
[1:11:48.860 --> 1:11:52.540]  turn it into the fuel you need for your small reactor that produces medical
[1:11:52.540 --> 1:11:56.220]  isotopes and guess what the Iranian said okay
[1:11:56.220 --> 1:11:59.980]  that sounds like a good idea what a shock even
[1:11:59.980 --> 1:12:03.180]  even the New York Times acknowledged that if this happens
[1:12:03.180 --> 1:12:06.940]  that would represent a major accomplishment reducing Iran's ability to
[1:12:06.940 --> 1:12:10.780]  make a nuclear weapon quickly and buying more time for negotiations okay
[1:12:10.780 --> 1:12:14.780]  well that looked really good guess what happened Jodhalla
[1:12:14.780 --> 1:12:20.940]  rose to the occasion and two and a half weeks later namely on october 18 2009
[1:12:20.940 --> 1:12:24.940]  mounted a guerrilla operation that killed the deputy commander
[1:12:24.940 --> 1:12:28.940]  of the revolutionary guards ground forces another brigadier general who
[1:12:28.940 --> 1:12:33.580]  commanded that part of uh of Iran three other brigade commanders
[1:12:33.580 --> 1:12:37.260]  and dozens of other military officers and civilians Jodhalla
[1:12:37.260 --> 1:12:41.020]  took proud credit for that now the next day
[1:12:41.020 --> 1:12:47.500]  uh was the resumption of negotiations uh in vienna this time to follow up on the
[1:12:47.500 --> 1:12:51.180]  breakthrough agreement and what you know you could see what happened would
[1:12:51.180 --> 1:12:54.060]  happen the revolutionary guards went to their patron
[1:12:54.060 --> 1:12:58.140]  who was the supreme leader Hamani and said you're gonna trust
[1:12:58.140 --> 1:13:01.660]  you're gonna trust the west after what they've done just now
[1:13:01.660 --> 1:13:05.420]  you're gonna trust them by putting 75 percent of your
[1:13:05.420 --> 1:13:09.340]  radium into russian and french chance give me a break
[1:13:09.340 --> 1:13:14.860]  and so the deal fell through um now was that a terrible disappointment to
[1:13:14.860 --> 1:13:18.780]  hillary clinton the rest of not at all they wanted the deal to
[1:13:18.780 --> 1:13:24.380]  so they're not concerned about the nuclear potential of Iran what they
[1:13:24.380 --> 1:13:28.300]  want is regime change and where these deals have gone through
[1:13:28.300 --> 1:13:32.460]  um within a jet and the rest of them would have been in a stronger position
[1:13:32.460 --> 1:13:36.460]  than the one they are now so you know this is so hypocritical
[1:13:36.460 --> 1:13:39.900]  and you know so i mean it doesn't take a
[1:13:39.900 --> 1:13:43.900]  uh rocket scientist to realize what's going on there they want regime change
[1:13:43.900 --> 1:13:48.300]  they don't care much about the nuclear
[1:13:48.300 --> 1:13:51.260]  thing or else they would have taken the iranians
[1:13:51.260 --> 1:13:56.380]  at you know on their on their agreement and principle to go through with it
[1:13:56.380 --> 1:13:59.660]  now rest of the story is the iranians have come up with several other very
[1:13:59.660 --> 1:14:03.420]  constructive suggestions they've all been turned down by guess who
[1:14:03.420 --> 1:14:06.700]  Rahm Emanuel and David and Dennis Ross another
[1:14:06.700 --> 1:14:10.860]  neo-con and so the idea is not so much
[1:14:10.860 --> 1:14:14.620]  the iranian problem but and the uh nuclear probably
[1:14:14.620 --> 1:14:19.180]  you know iranium but it's the iran problem it's off my dinner's yet
[1:14:19.180 --> 1:14:23.580]  when people still call and i saw it in usa today yesterday
[1:14:23.580 --> 1:14:28.060]  still say that he's trying to wipe israel off the face of the map
[1:14:28.060 --> 1:14:32.140]  that is a proved manufactured translation
[1:14:32.140 --> 1:14:35.340]  by the new york times and others of what he really said
[1:14:35.340 --> 1:14:38.540]  and what he really said it was nowhere close to that
[1:14:38.540 --> 1:14:42.940]  well we also what six months ago they said secret nuclear plant found in iran
[1:14:42.940 --> 1:14:45.820]  and it turned out they reported a plant they were building
[1:14:45.820 --> 1:14:48.620]  six months before they had to according to the
[1:14:48.620 --> 1:14:54.460]  iea rules and so hoax after hoax by the same globalist
[1:14:54.460 --> 1:14:59.740]  that have brought us wmd's in iraq yeah alex we have to be just a trifle
[1:14:59.740 --> 1:15:04.300]  careful here um i think uh talked a lot of experts here
[1:15:04.300 --> 1:15:09.100]  um iran should have notified us before they did about that thing when they
[1:15:09.100 --> 1:15:12.780]  did invite us in of course the uh he went inspectors found nothing so we're
[1:15:12.780 --> 1:15:17.100]  still at a very rudimentary stage but one has to remember that there are
[1:15:17.100 --> 1:15:22.460]  certain obligations iranians have not uh have not lived up to
[1:15:22.460 --> 1:15:26.060]  and uh and and you know people have been said to me
[1:15:26.060 --> 1:15:29.260]  well did the ran ever try to do a nuclear weapon
[1:15:29.260 --> 1:15:34.700]  well hell yes you know what's let's realize that up until the fall of 2003
[1:15:34.700 --> 1:15:38.460]  they spent almost two decades not working on nuclear weapons
[1:15:38.460 --> 1:15:42.940]  right i'm certainly no fan of iran i'm not a fan of any of these governments
[1:15:42.940 --> 1:15:46.300]  around the world they're almost always run by you know corrupt
[1:15:46.300 --> 1:15:49.420]  oligarchies or or these different you know regimes
[1:15:49.420 --> 1:15:52.620]  my issue is i don't want world war three to start
[1:15:52.620 --> 1:15:56.300]  uh there in the middle east and central asia and we really appreciate you
[1:15:56.300 --> 1:15:59.420]  coming on and breaking down all these different angles today
[1:15:59.420 --> 1:16:02.540]  and we certainly hope that war isn't launched in the spring
[1:16:02.540 --> 1:16:06.140]  uh or the summer we'll talk to you again soon thanks for the time most welcome
[1:16:06.140 --> 1:16:13.340]  all right there goes rey mcgovern now for the balance of this hour
[1:16:13.340 --> 1:16:17.340]  for the balance of this hour we are joined by
[1:16:17.340 --> 1:16:20.620]  micro vera of what really happened dot com
[1:16:20.620 --> 1:16:24.700]  fellow gc and radio host he joins us once a month here of course i'm alex
[1:16:24.700 --> 1:16:27.180]  jones of info wars dot com we just began
[1:16:27.180 --> 1:16:30.620]  simulcasting the last two hours and 45 minutes
[1:16:30.620 --> 1:16:33.900]  of this radio show we always take a portion of the show and
[1:16:33.900 --> 1:16:39.260]  transmitted visually for prison planet dot tv members i want to shift gears
[1:16:39.260 --> 1:16:43.500]  into the economy i want to get into the burgeoning
[1:16:43.500 --> 1:16:47.900]  police state the attack on the internet and a host of other issues with mike
[1:16:47.900 --> 1:16:50.540]  revero but in the balance of this short segment
[1:16:50.540 --> 1:16:55.020]  since we were just talking about senator carrie going over to israel this
[1:16:55.020 --> 1:16:57.820]  week saying please don't watch an attack on iran
[1:16:57.820 --> 1:17:01.100]  we have the military saying they don't want to do it but most of the newspapers
[1:17:01.100 --> 1:17:05.500]  pushing it i do want to get mike reveros take
[1:17:05.500 --> 1:17:08.620]  on what's happening in the middle east right now mike revero thanks for
[1:17:08.620 --> 1:17:11.740]  joining us thank you for having me there alex and my
[1:17:11.740 --> 1:17:14.860]  take on the middle east is as you point out we have
[1:17:14.860 --> 1:17:18.540]  a group of individuals in the united states and in israel
[1:17:18.540 --> 1:17:21.980]  who want yet another war on israel's enemies
[1:17:21.980 --> 1:17:25.580]  they're still pushing as hard as they can about two weeks ago leading up to the
[1:17:25.580 --> 1:17:28.700]  olympics there was this huge renewed propaganda effort
[1:17:28.700 --> 1:17:32.220]  to try and convince america that iran is some kind of a threat
[1:17:32.220 --> 1:17:35.900]  to us they didn't get any traction with that and they've kind of backed off
[1:17:35.900 --> 1:17:39.020]  then we were hearing about how israel might just go ahead and attack iran
[1:17:39.020 --> 1:17:42.700]  without the permission of the united states they were supposed to vote on
[1:17:42.700 --> 1:17:46.620]  that in the knesset on sunday i don't think they got the vote
[1:17:46.620 --> 1:17:50.700]  they're not acting like they got it now yes last night we got the statement
[1:17:50.700 --> 1:17:54.780]  from hillary clinton that renewed new sanctions against iran
[1:17:54.780 --> 1:17:59.020]  may take a couple of months and so i think the uh... news story we were
[1:17:59.020 --> 1:18:01.740]  seeing about how russia was now open to sanctions
[1:18:01.740 --> 1:18:05.100]  was not one hundred percent accurate because what russia really said is what
[1:18:05.100 --> 1:18:09.900]  they've always said if there was evidence of uh... a nuclear weapon
[1:18:09.900 --> 1:18:13.580]  program in iran they would support more sanctions but they're not willing to
[1:18:13.580 --> 1:18:16.940]  just support them uh... as things are right now
[1:18:16.940 --> 1:18:19.980]  what about iranian statements that we've been seeing from akhmed
[1:18:19.980 --> 1:18:25.340]  energy and others that they expect israel to attack him in the spring or summer
[1:18:25.340 --> 1:18:29.260]  uh... it seems a very reasonable expectation i think the only reason
[1:18:29.260 --> 1:18:34.220]  israel hasn't attacked yet is because the american government cannot get the
[1:18:34.220 --> 1:18:36.300]  support of the american people for another war
[1:18:36.300 --> 1:18:39.500]  and cannot get the support of the american people for any more assistance
[1:18:39.500 --> 1:18:42.780]  in aid in israel's wars against other countries
[1:18:42.780 --> 1:18:47.820]  i think uh... operation cast lead in gaza may prove in hindsight to have been
[1:18:47.820 --> 1:18:50.540]  israel's greatest political miscalculation
[1:18:50.540 --> 1:18:55.180]  they're trying to basically rebrand and spin it away as no big deal
[1:18:55.180 --> 1:18:59.500]  but i think the world got a real wake-up call about what israel is really like
[1:18:59.500 --> 1:19:02.700]  and the american people buying large do not want to support that
[1:19:02.700 --> 1:19:06.860]  either morally or financially and because of that i i think that's putting a
[1:19:06.860 --> 1:19:10.860]  break on the situation now of course our future is always under the control of
[1:19:10.860 --> 1:19:14.060]  whichever world leader is the least mentally stable
[1:19:14.060 --> 1:19:17.820]  and there are definitely people in israel who are capable of ordering an attack
[1:19:17.820 --> 1:19:22.060]  against iran knowing that israel could not withstand a counterattack
[1:19:22.060 --> 1:19:27.020]  but just absolutely serenely confident that they can get the u s to come in
[1:19:27.020 --> 1:19:31.180]  spend american dollars shed american lives to protect israel from the
[1:19:31.180 --> 1:19:34.540]  don't let a good crisis go to waste get us into a crisis
[1:19:34.540 --> 1:19:38.940]  and we're going to come back and finish up on this topic because
[1:19:38.940 --> 1:19:42.540]  we know israel at least large sectors of their government as you just said to
[1:19:42.540 --> 1:19:45.740]  connect it isn't really going for it right now so that's some good news
[1:19:45.740 --> 1:19:48.780]  but large sectors of the israeli government including their leader net
[1:19:48.780 --> 1:19:52.780]  nyahu do want it right now and they have some allies the military
[1:19:52.780 --> 1:19:56.300]  industrial complex and the big banks that want a new political
[1:19:56.300 --> 1:19:59.500]  distraction to bring in this new bank of the world
[1:19:59.500 --> 1:20:03.100]  that's being pushed we'll talk about that we all know that the burki water

[1:24:02.700 --> 1:24:15.980]  is it getting better
[1:24:17.420 --> 1:24:22.380]  or do you feel the same bottom line ladies and gentlemen
[1:24:22.380 --> 1:24:27.660]  the united states has become an engine of oppression and preemptive war
[1:24:27.660 --> 1:24:31.900]  and wars of aggression we're being robbed by the same offshore banks that own
[1:24:31.900 --> 1:24:35.980]  the big military industrial complex that are making hundreds of billions a year
[1:24:35.980 --> 1:24:39.260]  off the surveillance grid being installed all over the world
[1:24:39.260 --> 1:24:42.460]  but predominantly in england the u.s and canada australia
[1:24:42.460 --> 1:24:47.980]  new zealand and they want new wars and they are waging war against our
[1:24:47.980 --> 1:24:52.060]  liberties and freedoms and i was talking to mike revero
[1:24:52.060 --> 1:24:55.420]  about the fact that israel says they want to go to war with iran
[1:24:55.420 --> 1:25:00.060]  they have some allies though don't they mike in that the corrupt corporations
[1:25:00.060 --> 1:25:03.660]  need this political distraction and they need
[1:25:03.660 --> 1:25:07.500]  because they know if we're in a war people will put up with losing their
[1:25:07.500 --> 1:25:10.460]  jobs or having their pension funds seized
[1:25:10.460 --> 1:25:13.980]  they hope that people will put up with losing their jobs and having their
[1:25:13.980 --> 1:25:18.220]  pension funds seized it's this kind of wars distraction has
[1:25:18.220 --> 1:25:21.580]  worked before but this is a very new age and we're going
[1:25:21.580 --> 1:25:25.100]  into this potential escalation of conflict with the american people
[1:25:25.100 --> 1:25:28.940]  already polling as two-thirds are already angry with the federal government
[1:25:28.940 --> 1:25:32.220]  they don't trust the government they don't trust the banks they understand
[1:25:32.220 --> 1:25:34.540]  that wars are just a big money-making deal
[1:25:34.540 --> 1:25:38.380]  it places you know the banks want wars they don't even care which side wins or
[1:25:38.380 --> 1:25:42.620]  loses because both sides go into debt and that the american people certainly
[1:25:42.620 --> 1:25:46.140]  understand this and so i think the reaction of the american public to a new
[1:25:46.140 --> 1:25:49.340]  war is going to be dramatically different from what the government and
[1:25:49.340 --> 1:25:51.740]  the corporations and the banks hope it will be
[1:25:51.740 --> 1:25:55.180]  we understand about the military industrial complex we understand that
[1:25:55.180 --> 1:25:58.380]  iran is not actually a threat to the united states of america
[1:25:58.380 --> 1:26:01.420]  we understand that we were lied to the wars in afghanistan
[1:26:01.420 --> 1:26:06.060]  and iraq and that we're engaging in these covert wars in pakistan somalia and
[1:26:06.060 --> 1:26:09.740]  yemen we're killing more civilians than we are enemy combatants
[1:26:09.740 --> 1:26:13.180]  the american people i think are really kind of fed up i think a new war in
[1:26:13.180 --> 1:26:15.660]  iran is going to blow up in the government space
[1:26:15.660 --> 1:26:19.420]  i think that's the reason it hasn't started yet
[1:26:19.420 --> 1:26:23.660]  the only way i ran is a threat and this is just for my own common sense but i've
[1:26:23.660 --> 1:26:28.300]  seen a lot of top analysts say the same thing is if you do attack them
[1:26:28.300 --> 1:26:31.820]  according to the law of war if you're preemptively attacked
[1:26:31.820 --> 1:26:36.540]  you can fight back any way you want like us militaries always put special forces
[1:26:36.540 --> 1:26:40.860]  in behind enemy lines to blow up dams to attack police stations
[1:26:40.860 --> 1:26:43.740]  to engage in terror attacks that's just called
[1:26:43.740 --> 1:26:49.580]  uh you know guerrilla warfare but then the media has said if i ran so much as
[1:26:49.580 --> 1:26:53.900]  fires any aircraft guns at israel or us jets while they're
[1:26:53.900 --> 1:26:57.180]  bombing them that that's an act of terror i mean this is
[1:26:57.180 --> 1:27:01.820]  mass mental illness where anyone who buys into this is is
[1:27:01.820 --> 1:27:06.140]  basically the equivalent of saying anyone who raised a hand against hitler
[1:27:06.140 --> 1:27:09.180]  was bad or anyone who raised a hand against stalin was bad
[1:27:09.180 --> 1:27:14.060]  uh... that you don't have a right to raise your hand against an aggressor
[1:27:14.060 --> 1:27:18.220]  yes basically it's the how dare you fight back at us kind of situation
[1:27:18.220 --> 1:27:21.900]  and ours any is it would say you know are they allowed to do that
[1:27:21.900 --> 1:27:26.140]  kind of mentality and it is i mean you know we're waging war on all these
[1:27:26.140 --> 1:27:29.500]  countries and i think this is an extension of this whole idea
[1:27:29.500 --> 1:27:32.940]  that we're somehow doing these nations of favor we saw that with the run-up to
[1:27:32.940 --> 1:27:36.620]  iraq that they're going to greet us with flowers and therefore anybody who's
[1:27:36.620 --> 1:27:38.940]  shooting back this is just being a spoil sport
[1:27:38.940 --> 1:27:42.540]  the same thing going into iran we're just bringing those people democracy of
[1:27:42.540 --> 1:27:45.420]  course they're gonna welcome us and the only people shooting back at us are a
[1:27:45.420 --> 1:27:49.580]  bunch of malcontents and it's it's completely absurd the people that are
[1:27:49.580 --> 1:27:54.300]  shooting back at the american forces are the ordinary every day men women and
[1:27:54.300 --> 1:27:57.900]  children who live in a country and they want to hang on to it they don't want
[1:27:57.900 --> 1:28:00.860]  to see it taken over one another u.s. puppet
[1:28:00.860 --> 1:28:04.700]  we know why fema in all their manuals demonizes the founding fathers and
[1:28:04.700 --> 1:28:08.140]  calls them terrorists because the british were invading and they were
[1:28:08.140 --> 1:28:12.460]  fighting back against the imperial power and that is terrorism
[1:28:12.460 --> 1:28:16.300]  and if you read the internal pentagon documents the banks
[1:28:16.300 --> 1:28:20.300]  in syria and iraq and other places they want to wreck the infrastructure
[1:28:20.300 --> 1:28:23.740]  so the big banks can come in with loans at thirty percent interest
[1:28:23.740 --> 1:28:27.500]  with our tax money paying for it and take over their countries they
[1:28:27.500 --> 1:28:30.860]  they know there's not going to be roses they know they're not liberating
[1:28:30.860 --> 1:28:35.740]  we know in every case where the west has its druthers it installs dictators or
[1:28:35.740 --> 1:28:40.220]  oligarchs over these countries and actually puts muslim extremists
[1:28:40.220 --> 1:28:46.220]  back in power in afghanistan and into power in iraq because they like them
[1:28:46.220 --> 1:28:49.740]  they just want to keep the turmoil going because the turmoil creates business
[1:28:49.740 --> 1:28:53.900]  opportunities for american interest this is a war to impose american
[1:28:53.900 --> 1:28:57.260]  western banks on the rest of the world when you hear the buzz phrase
[1:28:57.260 --> 1:29:01.980]  clash of civilizations it's literally a war between two banking systems
[1:29:01.980 --> 1:29:05.420]  you have the islamic banking system on one and you have the western style
[1:29:05.420 --> 1:29:08.540]  banking system on the other the reserve banking system and as i've
[1:29:08.540 --> 1:29:11.820]  pointed out many many times before the problem with the federal reserve
[1:29:11.820 --> 1:29:14.300]  banking system is because all the money
[1:29:14.300 --> 1:29:17.020]  represents a loan from the private central bank
[1:29:17.020 --> 1:29:21.580]  to the people the instant that first federal reserve note goes into
[1:29:21.580 --> 1:29:24.620]  circulation more money is owed to the banking system
[1:29:24.620 --> 1:29:27.820]  than is actually in existence and this is why we have
[1:29:27.820 --> 1:29:30.780]  recession after recession after depression after depression
[1:29:30.780 --> 1:29:34.780]  and now they want to impose the same thing on the rest of the world
[1:29:34.780 --> 1:29:39.020]  we'll talk about the global dictatorship of the bank straight ahead a
[1:29:39.020 --> 1:29:44.140]  financial black hole designed from its inception to fully dominate and create
[1:29:44.140 --> 1:29:47.660]  neo feudalism they then come in with the phony environmentalism
[1:29:47.660 --> 1:29:51.820]  to camouflage open slavery
[1:29:51.900 --> 1:29:55.740]  we're on the march the empires on the run

[1:35:56.780 --> 1:36:01.020]  revero again who joins us from hawaii via video skype
[1:36:01.020 --> 1:36:04.860]  for the prison planet dot tv viewers radio you're hearing him
[1:36:04.860 --> 1:36:09.580]  the economy how long i guess the answer is they can't i mean
[1:36:09.580 --> 1:36:12.140]  they aren't fooling people but how long can they fool
[1:36:12.140 --> 1:36:16.300]  the rest of the dumbbells out there that we're not really in a depression
[1:36:16.300 --> 1:36:20.540]  that the banks gordon brown and others announcing a constitution of and by the
[1:36:20.540 --> 1:36:24.460]  banks globally bankrupting all the nations by design
[1:36:24.460 --> 1:36:27.740]  not just iceland not just spain not just uh grease
[1:36:27.740 --> 1:36:32.540]  but the us they're now openly in our media bloomberg financial everywhere
[1:36:32.540 --> 1:36:36.460]  parroting the banks will save us later this year early next year the next 16
[1:36:36.460 --> 1:36:40.060]  months the banks will save you they're going to bankrupt everything and then
[1:36:40.060 --> 1:36:43.180]  you will pay your taxes to them and we've got to raise taxes
[1:36:43.180 --> 1:36:46.780]  to pay the banks and cut medicare and medicaid and we've got to do this and
[1:36:46.780 --> 1:36:50.060]  we're going to have a depression who are already going into a depression
[1:36:50.060 --> 1:36:54.380]  because they've done it by design mike revero how do you see this unfolding
[1:36:54.380 --> 1:36:57.420]  and how bad from your research is the economy really
[1:36:57.420 --> 1:37:01.100]  well the economy is i think in a hopeless situation i mean
[1:37:01.100 --> 1:37:04.220]  the government has plunged us all deeply into debt
[1:37:04.220 --> 1:37:07.100]  they impoverished us even further to save wall street
[1:37:07.100 --> 1:37:10.780]  meanwhile they were sending all of our manufacturing jobs to other countries
[1:37:10.780 --> 1:37:15.660]  as i equate our economy to a boat with 10 holes in the bottom and the
[1:37:15.660 --> 1:37:19.580]  government only has five corks and all it's able to do right now is grab a
[1:37:19.580 --> 1:37:21.820]  cork out of one hole and shove it into another
[1:37:21.820 --> 1:37:25.260]  in full view of the press cameras and say look i'm correcting the problem i'm
[1:37:25.260 --> 1:37:27.900]  fixing the problem but we know the long term
[1:37:27.900 --> 1:37:31.260]  there i don't think it's possible to save this country right now i don't think
[1:37:31.260 --> 1:37:35.020]  it's possible to save the economy and you know you and i have talked about the
[1:37:35.020 --> 1:37:39.660]  push for a global government and we know that the three avenues of three venues
[1:37:39.660 --> 1:37:43.660]  that they've been pushing forward are one is human cause global warming which is
[1:37:43.660 --> 1:37:48.140]  crumbling uh... the second one was the global pandemic that's not working out
[1:37:48.140 --> 1:37:52.460]  but the one that they're still very much on track with is the global economic
[1:37:52.460 --> 1:37:55.740]  meltdown where they're going to destroy the economies of all these various
[1:37:55.740 --> 1:37:59.180]  nations and then say look we've got a brand new world bank
[1:37:59.180 --> 1:38:02.700]  that is going to make everything all better and of course that's nonsense
[1:38:02.700 --> 1:38:06.060]  insanity is defined as doing the same thing over and over again
[1:38:06.060 --> 1:38:10.300]  and expecting a different outcome we have a reserve banking system in place
[1:38:10.300 --> 1:38:13.740]  in the united states of america that has brought us nothing but pain
[1:38:13.740 --> 1:38:17.820]  misery recession depression the real wealth of the nation has been sucked
[1:38:17.820 --> 1:38:21.180]  out of the hands of the people and put in the pockets of the private bankers
[1:38:21.180 --> 1:38:24.780]  and now they want to impose that entire that same exact system
[1:38:24.780 --> 1:38:29.180]  over the entire globe and this is why we're cranking up for war in the mid-east
[1:38:29.180 --> 1:38:32.300]  because in order for the western style banking system to become the global
[1:38:32.300 --> 1:38:35.900]  standard all the nations using the islamic banking system
[1:38:35.900 --> 1:38:39.260]  have to be conquered that's what the clash of civilizations is
[1:38:39.260 --> 1:38:45.820]  it's a war between banking systems
[1:38:45.820 --> 1:38:49.740]  now this is their big gamble i mean they've got homeland security north com
[1:38:49.740 --> 1:38:53.100]  openly set up to suppress the people they're federalizing all the local police
[1:38:53.100 --> 1:38:56.780]  they're putting in surveillance they're trampling the bill of rights federal
[1:38:56.780 --> 1:39:00.380]  courts everywhere ruling there's no fourth amendment
[1:39:00.380 --> 1:39:04.940]  they clearly are going for broke how do you see you say you don't think they'll
[1:39:04.940 --> 1:39:08.140]  get away with it and i think you're there's a chance that you're right
[1:39:08.140 --> 1:39:12.460]  but they're still going ahead with it how do you see this unfolding
[1:39:12.460 --> 1:39:15.500]  well i think the reason they're going ahead with it is first of all there's a
[1:39:15.500 --> 1:39:18.460]  lot of social inertia in that governmental structure
[1:39:18.460 --> 1:39:21.900]  and the people in charge are really still kind of living back at the height of
[1:39:21.900 --> 1:39:24.940]  the cold war which is why they're they're waving missiles at the russians
[1:39:24.940 --> 1:39:27.100]  again and the problem is
[1:39:27.100 --> 1:39:30.700]  that the people who are at the top of these pyramids there they're really
[1:39:30.700 --> 1:39:33.500]  old very rich ultra rich and powerful people
[1:39:33.500 --> 1:39:38.140]  don't really understand the very fundamental change to the nature
[1:39:38.140 --> 1:39:41.980]  information flows to our society brought by the internet by the alternative
[1:39:41.980 --> 1:39:45.340]  media they're still playing the game by the rules that worked at the height of
[1:39:45.340 --> 1:39:48.940]  the cold war in the nineteen fifties nineteen sixties and had they done
[1:39:48.940 --> 1:39:52.540]  this what they're doing today fifty years ago that probably would have been
[1:39:52.540 --> 1:39:55.180]  able to work today i don't think so
[1:39:55.180 --> 1:39:58.060]  and we're seeing more and more people around the world getting angry
[1:39:58.060 --> 1:40:02.140]  and starting to kick this old style government and economic system out they
[1:40:02.140 --> 1:40:05.260]  didn't know island they're getting ready to do it in greece i think it could
[1:40:05.260 --> 1:40:11.260]  even happen here in the united states very soon
[1:40:11.260 --> 1:40:17.420]  but we go back to the same issue they are just continuing their takeover
[1:40:17.420 --> 1:40:22.060]  and the states are moving more than thirty of them
[1:40:22.060 --> 1:40:24.940]  to declare tenth amendment ninth amendment powers over the federal
[1:40:24.940 --> 1:40:28.620]  government the mainstream media spends that to say all the states want rebellion
[1:40:28.620 --> 1:40:31.820]  they want to succeed no they want to implement
[1:40:31.820 --> 1:40:35.020]  the ninth and tenth amendment saying the states created you
[1:40:35.020 --> 1:40:38.220]  you don't have these powers uh... that you've claimed
[1:40:38.220 --> 1:40:41.660]  you keep giving us unfunded mandates you keep taking our tax money and then
[1:40:41.660 --> 1:40:44.780]  sending part of it back with strings attached
[1:40:44.780 --> 1:40:49.260]  uh... washington is run by foreign countries and big corporations
[1:40:49.260 --> 1:40:53.340]  uh... congress now has an eight percent approval rating ron paul is an eighty
[1:40:53.340 --> 1:40:54.300]  four
[1:40:54.300 --> 1:40:57.220]  again showing that they have lost the war
[1:40:57.220 --> 1:40:59.380]  for the hearts and minds of the people
[1:40:59.380 --> 1:41:04.620]  and so i agree with you that we've got a really good chance of
[1:41:04.620 --> 1:41:08.500]  somehow displacing these people and just arresting this lot of
[1:41:08.500 --> 1:41:10.580]  of uh... kinley slash
[1:41:10.580 --> 1:41:13.100]  made off times
[1:41:13.100 --> 1:41:15.740]  still you have the fact that
[1:41:15.740 --> 1:41:18.380]  if they wreck us bad enough financially
[1:41:18.380 --> 1:41:20.980]  then the federal government's the only thing big enough
[1:41:20.980 --> 1:41:23.140]  and they control the fiat money machine
[1:41:23.140 --> 1:41:25.620]  to basically buy off enough people
[1:41:25.620 --> 1:41:29.540]  uh... you know with their little credits on their on their welfare cards
[1:41:29.540 --> 1:41:32.340]  to go along with the system you've got half the public working for the
[1:41:32.340 --> 1:41:35.980]  government or getting government contracts so i see that as
[1:41:35.980 --> 1:41:40.180]  an internal type of almost political civil war
[1:41:40.180 --> 1:41:43.900]  uh... the parasite class against the rest of us and we have jobless claims
[1:41:43.900 --> 1:41:45.940]  up twelve percent the last two weeks
[1:41:45.940 --> 1:41:49.660]  you know last year we were losing on average a half million jobs a month
[1:41:49.660 --> 1:41:51.060]  now it's
[1:41:51.060 --> 1:41:54.820]  uh... right at one million eight hundred thousand jobs being lost a month
[1:41:54.820 --> 1:41:57.140]  this is clearly a depression
[1:41:57.140 --> 1:42:01.100]  uh... that we're in oil surges of seventy nine dollars as the dollar
[1:42:01.100 --> 1:42:02.180]  plunges
[1:42:02.180 --> 1:42:04.100]  uh... gold reaches
[1:42:04.100 --> 1:42:05.860]  uh... it's uh...
[1:42:05.860 --> 1:42:08.380]  six week high of one thousand one hundred and
[1:42:08.380 --> 1:42:10.380]  twenty five fifty
[1:42:10.380 --> 1:42:15.780]  uh... we've got uh... medicare cut across the country twenty one percent
[1:42:15.780 --> 1:42:17.740]  outside of any legislation
[1:42:17.740 --> 1:42:22.180]  uh... that's in the news i mean all of this is going on and we see the signals
[1:42:22.180 --> 1:42:25.180]  by the media and the government that they want to start clamping down on the
[1:42:25.180 --> 1:42:26.220]  internet
[1:42:26.220 --> 1:42:28.780]  uh... that's my next point i have for you
[1:42:28.780 --> 1:42:31.900]  i was trying to go to this article
[1:42:31.900 --> 1:42:34.220]  out of blog spot today
[1:42:34.220 --> 1:42:38.260]  headline mister larry pullett silvestain did you commit insurance fraud on nine
[1:42:38.260 --> 1:42:39.340]  eleven
[1:42:39.340 --> 1:42:42.300]  and it's a pretty mild article just basing the facts
[1:42:42.300 --> 1:42:45.340]  all this record insurance he bought in the fact that building seven was
[1:42:45.340 --> 1:42:46.700]  clearly blown up
[1:42:46.700 --> 1:42:48.860]  uh... give me a document cam shot guys
[1:42:48.860 --> 1:42:51.260]  there's a little bit doodling on here but the point is
[1:42:51.260 --> 1:42:53.060]  uh... content warning
[1:42:53.060 --> 1:42:54.900]  when i tried to go to blogger
[1:42:54.900 --> 1:42:56.100]  google
[1:42:56.100 --> 1:42:58.300]  which isn't even the browser i use
[1:42:58.300 --> 1:43:00.580]  somehow laid this over
[1:43:00.580 --> 1:43:02.460]  uh... the template
[1:43:02.460 --> 1:43:05.660]  and i'm getting reports people are sending screenshots for info wars dot com
[1:43:05.660 --> 1:43:08.580]  present planet dot com this is happening as well
[1:43:08.580 --> 1:43:11.980]  it says some readers of this blog have contacted google because they believe

[1:43:49.980 --> 1:43:51.180]  by microsoft
[1:43:51.180 --> 1:43:55.100]  just without a court order without anything we see open calls for this
[1:43:55.100 --> 1:43:58.260]  micro vero comment on the attacks on the internet
[1:43:58.260 --> 1:44:03.420]  we're absolutely correct the uh... i think that the copenhagen disaster and
[1:44:03.420 --> 1:44:05.540]  that the climate-gate scandal
[1:44:05.540 --> 1:44:08.700]  was the wake-up call for the powers that think they are
[1:44:08.700 --> 1:44:11.900]  where they're finally beginning to realize they've lost the ability to
[1:44:11.900 --> 1:44:15.700]  lie the people of the world into going to whatever direction they want to go
[1:44:15.700 --> 1:44:19.220]  they just now realizing they can't sell us the wars they want anymore
[1:44:19.220 --> 1:44:22.740]  they can't always sell us the president's are gonna want the american people are
[1:44:22.740 --> 1:44:26.260]  angry with the government they're starting to turn away they've lost trust not
[1:44:26.260 --> 1:44:28.500]  only in the government but in the corporate media
[1:44:28.500 --> 1:44:32.700]  and so we know that cast sunsteen obama's are was saying
[1:44:32.700 --> 1:44:37.380]  well if we can't automatically wave a magic wand and bring the public's trust
[1:44:37.380 --> 1:44:39.420]  back to the government the corporate media
[1:44:39.420 --> 1:44:42.700]  then let's go out and start destroying the trust they have in the
[1:44:42.700 --> 1:44:45.540]  alternative media and the blogosphere to at least
[1:44:45.540 --> 1:44:48.900]  you know level the playing field and then we'll spend a lot of money back at
[1:44:48.900 --> 1:44:49.900]  the tv networks
[1:44:49.900 --> 1:44:52.980]  for really beautiful high-tech sets in a lot of really pretty people
[1:44:52.980 --> 1:44:56.220]  and see if we can lure the people back that way but it really isn't working
[1:44:56.220 --> 1:44:58.100]  again it's cold war mindset
[1:44:58.100 --> 1:45:01.460]  and the bottom line is all these little warnings that are going up there are
[1:45:01.460 --> 1:45:02.980]  just telling people okay
[1:45:02.980 --> 1:45:04.220]  this is something that
[1:45:04.220 --> 1:45:07.700]  some vested interest doesn't want me to see and it's going to have the band in
[1:45:07.700 --> 1:45:08.420]  boston
[1:45:08.420 --> 1:45:11.300]  affect people go right past those warnings
[1:45:11.300 --> 1:45:14.500]  and they say oh wow this got to be something really tasty in here now
[1:45:14.500 --> 1:45:17.180]  and and so i think it's actually having the opposite
[1:45:17.180 --> 1:45:19.220]  effect from what is being intended
[1:45:19.220 --> 1:45:21.620]  but it's setting the precedent
[1:45:21.620 --> 1:45:26.420]  for them to start gatekeeping according to anonymous complaints
[1:45:26.420 --> 1:45:29.780]  well in i think that's where they want to go with that
[1:45:29.780 --> 1:45:34.420]  but i think the american people are are going to understand
[1:45:34.420 --> 1:45:37.700]  that basically is the hallmark of the dick dictatorship and i think at the
[1:45:37.700 --> 1:45:41.460]  point where they start saying you cannot look at certain websites any longer
[1:45:41.460 --> 1:45:45.700]  is when america is going to lose any last remaining denial that it has about
[1:45:45.700 --> 1:45:48.180]  what this country's become
[1:45:48.180 --> 1:45:51.860]  i agree with you separately
[1:45:51.860 --> 1:45:54.820]  now not just the borders but at airports everywhere
[1:45:54.820 --> 1:45:58.100]  the federal government says they have the right without due process without
[1:45:58.100 --> 1:46:02.260]  probable cause without what's the exact quote here
[1:46:02.260 --> 1:46:04.740]  um i actually had the uh seattle
[1:46:04.740 --> 1:46:09.220]  seattle times is also in the la times it's a hugo martin article published in
[1:46:09.220 --> 1:46:09.940]  both
[1:46:09.940 --> 1:46:14.420]  no curves on border searches of cell phones and laptops and then it says
[1:46:14.420 --> 1:46:16.820]  us customs and airports
[1:46:16.820 --> 1:46:21.140]  uh so separately uh are taking electronic devices without
[1:46:21.140 --> 1:46:24.820]  first establishing suspicion of wrongdoing and keeping them
[1:46:24.820 --> 1:46:28.740]  for sometimes six weeks and downloading everything off of them without warrants
[1:46:28.740 --> 1:46:32.260]  we know whatever they do in the airports is a beta test for the wider society i
[1:46:32.260 --> 1:46:35.220]  mean this is worse than communist china
[1:46:35.220 --> 1:46:37.780]  yeah it absolutely is i mean we're already hearing that they're going to
[1:46:37.780 --> 1:46:42.100]  start putting the naked scanners in bus and train stations and this idea of
[1:46:42.100 --> 1:46:46.020]  grabbing somebody's portable electronic device and simply looting it
[1:46:46.020 --> 1:46:49.460]  uh... i i mean this is such a dangerous situation
[1:46:49.460 --> 1:46:53.460]  not because we're necessarily carrying anything electronic or terror
[1:46:53.460 --> 1:46:56.340]  or uh... terror plans or or anything like that
[1:46:56.340 --> 1:46:59.700]  basically they're trying to enforce the digital millennium copyright act
[1:46:59.700 --> 1:47:03.300]  they're basically trying to make sure you don't have pirated music and without
[1:47:03.300 --> 1:47:07.060]  due process without due process they just do it they just line up and take
[1:47:07.060 --> 1:47:08.180]  your goods
[1:47:08.180 --> 1:47:11.620]  i mean i thought he's the nazis just lined you up and took your papers and
[1:47:11.620 --> 1:47:15.300]  looked at him and this is now just we're just taking this from you
[1:47:15.300 --> 1:47:17.620]  we'll see the problem i have with this
[1:47:17.620 --> 1:47:21.700]  is that a lot of us are carrying information data on our on our cell
[1:47:21.700 --> 1:47:23.220]  phones on our laptops
[1:47:23.220 --> 1:47:27.540]  that may be confidential to our clients and we already know that every time the
[1:47:27.540 --> 1:47:31.220]  fb i get something they think they can use to do some insider stock trading
[1:47:31.220 --> 1:47:34.180]  they've been caught doing insider trading with information they loot
[1:47:34.180 --> 1:47:38.580]  from cell phones and laptops and phone taps exactly they admit this is being
[1:47:38.580 --> 1:47:42.420]  dumped into the nsa database and the government hands it out to all their
[1:47:42.420 --> 1:47:44.020]  criminal friends
[1:47:44.020 --> 1:47:47.860]  absolutely which opens up opportunities to basically for in government
[1:47:47.860 --> 1:47:52.900]  insiders to make money off of your work in my day job i have information
[1:47:52.900 --> 1:47:56.900]  visuals that belong to my clients that are not supposed to get out in the
[1:47:56.900 --> 1:48:00.740]  public until after the program has aired if they get out early and get into
[1:48:00.740 --> 1:48:02.340]  people magazine or something
[1:48:02.340 --> 1:48:06.500]  i'm in real big trouble i don't mean you work on some of the hottest tv shows
[1:48:06.500 --> 1:48:07.620]  out there
[1:48:07.620 --> 1:48:12.820]  yes i am and you know some guy at t's tsa sees a compromising picture of a star
[1:48:12.820 --> 1:48:15.300]  sells it to his buddy over at the fan magazine
[1:48:15.300 --> 1:48:18.820]  they all make money and i get in trouble because i'm not taking proper care
[1:48:18.820 --> 1:48:23.140]  of the uh... proprietary information i already got caught in england last month
[1:48:23.140 --> 1:48:28.100]  with a with a tv movie star to taking his naked photo in the scanner
[1:48:28.100 --> 1:48:31.060]  yeah absolutely so we we cannot trust these people
[1:48:31.060 --> 1:48:34.900]  with our data and so basically what the government is saying is
[1:48:34.900 --> 1:48:38.260]  that you know they they have the right to come into our place of business which
[1:48:38.260 --> 1:48:41.700]  is our cell phone and simply rifle through and anything they find useful
[1:48:41.700 --> 1:48:43.380]  they're going to take and sell
[1:48:43.380 --> 1:48:46.260]  and meanwhile and you know anything that we have that they don't think we
[1:48:46.260 --> 1:48:48.420]  should have they're gonna throw us in jail about
[1:48:48.420 --> 1:48:50.660]  but also frame you with it
[1:48:50.660 --> 1:48:53.140]  yeah very and yeah they can plant data on that
[1:48:53.140 --> 1:48:55.700]  device just as easily as they can take it off
[1:48:55.700 --> 1:48:59.300]  and that's the only videos do we see from cops on squad cars
[1:48:59.300 --> 1:49:02.580]  where they do hand signals and plant drugs on people
[1:49:02.580 --> 1:49:06.100]  it's it's a major problem and they they could put something like them
[1:49:06.100 --> 1:49:10.740]  uh... we already have seen cases where uh... hackers working for example for
[1:49:10.740 --> 1:49:14.340]  israel will hack into somebody's computer and plant child porn
[1:49:14.340 --> 1:49:17.380]  and then call the authorities on somebody to get them busted
[1:49:17.380 --> 1:49:21.220]  and it's just a huge problem somebody could take an iphone going through the
[1:49:21.220 --> 1:49:24.660]  gate and then come up to you later on so we found this picture of an underage
[1:49:24.660 --> 1:49:28.580]  girl you know whatever and then you get to go off
[1:49:28.580 --> 1:49:31.140]  to jail and they put you in the sexual predator register
[1:49:31.140 --> 1:49:36.020]  and basically destroy your life and it all comes down to the fact that we
[1:49:36.020 --> 1:49:39.460]  cannot trust this government with our personal
[1:49:39.460 --> 1:49:42.820]  data and this is why we should be very angry about this idea that they're
[1:49:42.820 --> 1:49:45.140]  going to be grabbing our cell phones and laptops
[1:49:45.140 --> 1:49:47.300]  it's not because we've got anything to hide
[1:49:47.300 --> 1:49:51.700]  it's just that we have a government that thinks it already owns all of our own
[1:49:51.700 --> 1:49:55.380]  private and that's why we have the precious fourth amendment this hedge
[1:49:55.380 --> 1:49:58.980]  around us from the experiences of an oppressive government
[1:49:58.980 --> 1:50:01.780]  that our forebears went through and they traveled from europe
[1:50:01.780 --> 1:50:04.980]  to the colonies and what they went through in the colonies
[1:50:04.980 --> 1:50:09.860]  uh... i mean it's just common sense and these precious ancient rights that go
[1:50:09.860 --> 1:50:12.500]  back to before the magna carter
[1:50:12.500 --> 1:50:16.820]  i mean think about eight years ago everybody freaked out of the patriot act
[1:50:16.820 --> 1:50:20.340]  now without even a whimper obama reauthorizes
[1:50:20.340 --> 1:50:24.980]  the worst provisions the whole thing and there's almost no fanfare with it
[1:50:24.980 --> 1:50:28.740]  and their naked body recording us and seizing our laptops
[1:50:28.740 --> 1:50:32.020]  and and and and public schools are watching children
[1:50:32.020 --> 1:50:36.020]  through the laptops at home without warrants and they think it's so normal
[1:50:36.020 --> 1:50:40.820]  they tell on themselves and say yeah we're watching you this is freedom
[1:50:40.820 --> 1:50:44.420]  this is what the founders wanted was laptops watching you in your bedroom
[1:50:44.420 --> 1:50:49.220]  you know without warrants i mean this is unbelievable and it's just getting
[1:50:49.220 --> 1:50:52.100]  worse by the day by the week by the month by the year
[1:50:52.100 --> 1:50:54.980]  i mean think how far we've come the last eight and a half years since 9 11
[1:50:54.980 --> 1:50:58.660]  where are we going two segments straight ahead with mike revero your phone

[1:55:21.220 --> 1:55:25.780]  alex i i got two things uh... can you hear me okay yes i can
[1:55:25.780 --> 1:55:31.140]  yeah um... it's about it's about glenn beck and chris mathews and people like
[1:55:31.140 --> 1:55:34.340]  that uh... my question is
[1:55:34.340 --> 1:55:39.380]  uh... we know that they're phonies and that but they're also working towards an
[1:55:39.380 --> 1:55:43.380]  agenda with what they come out with and that it's a
[1:55:43.380 --> 1:55:48.580]  highly uh... sophisticated psi op but but it's also
[1:55:48.580 --> 1:55:54.500]  we know that it's not personally them that that's doing that and their ideas
[1:55:54.500 --> 1:55:58.900]  and stuff so my question is how do you think
[1:55:58.900 --> 1:56:03.220]  who gives them their orders and how to how does this how do they
[1:56:03.220 --> 1:56:08.340]  uh... in there you know who's telling them what to do and running that agenda
[1:56:08.340 --> 1:56:11.860]  all right let me comment on that and get mike reveros take on it
[1:56:11.860 --> 1:56:15.140]  okay it's it's it's sophisticated chris mathews has been a political operative
[1:56:15.140 --> 1:56:18.020]  for thirty years that is what chris mathews believes
[1:56:18.020 --> 1:56:21.300]  and they'll get a talking point ron paul surging in the polls for president
[1:56:21.300 --> 1:56:24.900]  to come out and say his supporters are dangerous he's bad he's racist
[1:56:24.900 --> 1:56:28.820]  and then beck and uh... mathews put that out once he's driven down in the
[1:56:28.820 --> 1:56:31.620]  polls they can have him on and make themselves look good
[1:56:31.620 --> 1:56:34.740]  uh... they get talking points this is on record
[1:56:34.740 --> 1:56:38.980]  about what they're pushing so you see mathews and beck pushing new taxes
[1:56:38.980 --> 1:56:42.660]  to pay the bankers i mean it it's very transparent there
[1:56:42.660 --> 1:56:46.180]  their teleprompters are loaded for them on talking points
[1:56:46.180 --> 1:56:49.300]  and when they have guests on they just regard to take those talking points
[1:56:49.300 --> 1:56:53.940]  mike revero yeah absolutely i mean the message is uh... sending and you know
[1:56:53.940 --> 1:56:57.620]  and it's not exactly that they sit in an office and somebody says you will tell
[1:56:57.620 --> 1:57:01.220]  us to your audience but when they go to parties and dinners and on the golf
[1:57:01.220 --> 1:57:04.340]  course and they have discussions with their backers and supporters and
[1:57:04.340 --> 1:57:08.740]  friends it's this little sort of gentlemen's club or this little click
[1:57:08.740 --> 1:57:12.180]  where they're saying this is what the agenda is going to be to serve the
[1:57:12.180 --> 1:57:15.540]  collective good of the very very rich people
[1:57:15.540 --> 1:57:19.140]  and uh... the the general way that it operates is somebody like a glenbeck
[1:57:19.140 --> 1:57:22.900]  will come out and for a while he'll say the things that we all want to hear
[1:57:22.900 --> 1:57:27.460]  and then slowly he'll start turning around and start trying to lead us
[1:57:27.460 --> 1:57:30.260]  back into the fold it's like the way a sheep dog
[1:57:30.260 --> 1:57:34.340]  will try and get some errant sheep and and nudge them back into the to the
[1:57:34.340 --> 1:57:37.300]  greater flock and that's kind of what they're doing here
[1:57:37.300 --> 1:57:40.340]  and so every once in a while you'll see somebody and you say yeah i love the
[1:57:40.340 --> 1:57:43.860]  way that you know that uh... glenbeck is saying the things i want to hear and
[1:57:43.860 --> 1:57:47.060]  keith oberman is saying all the good things and then once they've built the
[1:57:47.060 --> 1:57:51.460]  audience then they basically start towing them back well i mean here's an
[1:57:51.460 --> 1:57:55.860]  example there was a political article yesterday i never got it to it uh...
[1:57:55.860 --> 1:57:59.380]  it had a headline like republicans go after radicals in their own party will
[1:57:59.380 --> 1:58:02.980]  you print that for me and it had top republican strategist saying
[1:58:02.980 --> 1:58:07.140]  we're going after the birthers uh... we're going after the truthers we're
[1:58:07.140 --> 1:58:09.940]  going after people that don't like the fellow reserve
[1:58:09.940 --> 1:58:13.540]  we're targeting them and demonizing them so they have
[1:58:13.540 --> 1:58:17.140]  the real talking points get written by their strategist put out
[1:58:17.140 --> 1:58:20.820]  and then they load that into teleprompters and follow it and it's come out
[1:58:20.820 --> 1:58:26.260]  in 2000 the cnn is full of cia operatives uh... literally scripting it so there
[1:58:26.260 --> 1:58:29.380]  is some actual scripting uh... that's going on we're going to come back
[1:58:29.380 --> 1:58:33.700]  with another segment with mike revero talk to karen john herman bob and others

[2:02:27.220 --> 2:02:30.340]  uh at the end as we were opening the phones up for questions or comments for
[2:02:30.340 --> 2:02:33.460]  mike uh mike the good news is people are becoming
[2:02:33.460 --> 2:02:35.540]  politically active and they don't have to save the world
[2:02:35.540 --> 2:02:40.100]  with one stroke uh put a website up put up flyers go to city council
[2:02:40.100 --> 2:02:42.820]  start an access tv show start a local radio show
[2:02:42.820 --> 2:02:47.620]  i mean we really are seeing a giant wave of people waking up
[2:02:47.620 --> 2:02:50.580]  absolutely and that's just wonderful to see happen because
[2:02:50.580 --> 2:02:53.540]  the very best thing that anybody can do because you know they call and they say
[2:02:53.540 --> 2:02:57.700]  what can i do to help in everything the very best thing you can do is speak out
[2:02:57.700 --> 2:03:00.820]  share your concerns with everybody around you because the more you speak
[2:03:00.820 --> 2:03:04.100]  out the more you're going to give courage to others to speak out
[2:03:04.100 --> 2:03:07.220]  because the biggest lie the government is telling all of us
[2:03:07.220 --> 2:03:10.260]  is that those who are unhappy with the government are this tiny little fringe
[2:03:10.260 --> 2:03:12.900]  minority who really no polite company should
[2:03:12.900 --> 2:03:15.620]  tolerate and they should just go away and stay silent
[2:03:15.620 --> 2:03:18.740]  but when you all speak out at the same time you begin to realize
[2:03:18.740 --> 2:03:22.100]  that it really is a majority of americans are totally fed up
[2:03:22.100 --> 2:03:24.900]  they're furious with the federal government they think the time has come
[2:03:24.900 --> 2:03:29.300]  for a change and if enough of us wake up and
[2:03:29.300 --> 2:03:32.580]  speak out and just do little things every day
[2:03:32.580 --> 2:03:35.620]  the illusion is going to completely implode
[2:03:35.620 --> 2:03:39.220]  absolutely i mean i think the illusion has already imploded
[2:03:39.220 --> 2:03:42.820]  i think the idea that the government is ruling with the consent of the govern
[2:03:42.820 --> 2:03:46.500]  that one is completely gone at this point the polls are always showing the
[2:03:46.500 --> 2:03:50.100]  the people of america see the government as the biggest threat to their freedom
[2:03:50.100 --> 2:03:52.900]  they are angry with the government they don't trust the government
[2:03:52.900 --> 2:03:56.820]  uh... support for the government i think uh... if you discount all the people
[2:03:56.820 --> 2:03:58.660]  who are getting a government paycheck
[2:03:58.660 --> 2:04:02.900]  support for the federal government has collapsed completely at this point
[2:04:02.900 --> 2:04:06.580]  and when the media tells us the economy is getting better and people know it's
[2:04:06.580 --> 2:04:09.540]  getting worse again they're just bleeding out they're losing
[2:04:09.540 --> 2:04:13.380]  whatever little bit of credibility and mystique i see the statistics
[2:04:13.380 --> 2:04:16.420]  now that came out today that the internet is now way bigger than the
[2:04:16.420 --> 2:04:20.100]  mainstream media put together i mean they are in free fall
[2:04:20.100 --> 2:04:23.380]  they absolutely are they're losing their audience the audience is coming over to
[2:04:23.380 --> 2:04:27.540]  me we just upgraded to a new server only two weeks ago and already it's swamped
[2:04:27.540 --> 2:04:32.180]  and saturated and i mean that's how fast this thing is growing
[2:04:32.180 --> 2:04:35.620]  it's unbelievable michael talk to you again live next month thank you for

[2:08:30.100 --> 2:08:34.340]  scrutinizes state local gun control the gun grabbers are in here saying this
[2:08:34.340 --> 2:08:39.700]  may be good for us we'll explain why coming up
[2:08:39.700 --> 2:08:44.820]  i'm also going to get into some other important news that we haven't even
[2:08:44.820 --> 2:08:48.260]  covered yet like green fuels cause more harm
[2:08:48.260 --> 2:08:52.820]  than fossil fuels according to report this out of the london times now we
[2:08:52.820 --> 2:08:56.340]  already knew this so why is the un pushing it
[2:08:56.340 --> 2:09:01.220]  because they know it cause tens of millions that's a conservative number
[2:09:01.220 --> 2:09:05.380]  of more people to starve to death than the last five years per year
[2:09:05.380 --> 2:09:10.020]  than previously were over a billion people are living on the
[2:09:10.020 --> 2:09:15.780]  edge of starvation ladies and gentlemen our poorest live like kings
[2:09:15.780 --> 2:09:18.580]  compared to people in many areas of africa asia
[2:09:18.580 --> 2:09:22.740]  and latin america so we're going to be breaking that down
[2:09:22.740 --> 2:09:27.220]  coming up as well i talked about some of this in the first hour and we
[2:09:27.220 --> 2:09:30.580]  discussed it as well in the second with mitre vero
[2:09:30.580 --> 2:09:36.980]  but i want to really flesh this out for people
[2:09:36.980 --> 2:09:41.300]  how do we get the word out to the public that it's the private central banks
[2:09:41.300 --> 2:09:45.220]  bringing in the green tyranny the fake environmentalism the taxing system
[2:09:45.220 --> 2:09:48.900]  the bank of the world the global government that engineered the financial
[2:09:48.900 --> 2:09:51.620]  collapse that have built the big government so they could get us into
[2:09:51.620 --> 2:09:55.380]  debt and control us how do we get the word out to
[2:09:55.380 --> 2:09:59.140]  the people that it's worse than they even know the average person knows the
[2:09:59.140 --> 2:10:03.620]  economy's falling apart but do they know in the last
[2:10:03.620 --> 2:10:10.260]  month every week 496,000 jobs were lost that's almost
[2:10:10.260 --> 2:10:15.940]  2 million in a month 1,800,000 that is so incredible and that's from
[2:10:15.940 --> 2:10:20.420]  cnn we have oil starting to go back up in price
[2:10:20.420 --> 2:10:24.180]  and other commodities because the central banks that met in secret three
[2:10:24.180 --> 2:10:27.860]  weeks ago in australia are in a concerted coordinated
[2:10:27.860 --> 2:10:32.980]  operation to lower currencies in tandem so that the
[2:10:32.980 --> 2:10:37.700]  public doesn't notice it as much just like if the mexican peso started
[2:10:37.700 --> 2:10:40.740]  going down the dollar goes down with it so you don't notice
[2:10:40.740 --> 2:10:44.740]  overall that hey my dollar isn't worth as much next to the peso
[2:10:44.740 --> 2:10:51.300]  we've got gold at a six-week high of $1,125 and 50 cents and it's
[2:10:51.300 --> 2:10:55.220]  trending up even higher in its futures market what the
[2:10:55.220 --> 2:10:59.540]  different markets are saying it'll be in the days and weeks to come
[2:10:59.540 --> 2:11:02.660]  and then i've got articles here you know you've heard obama and others say oh
[2:11:02.660 --> 2:11:04.500]  we're going to give you all this free health care
[2:11:04.500 --> 2:11:08.500]  but oh we've got to pass this to cut back on health care cost
[2:11:08.500 --> 2:11:13.540]  and then you see all these big insurance stock owners
[2:11:13.540 --> 2:11:17.620]  running around like the owner of berkshire
[2:11:17.620 --> 2:11:21.380]  hathaway warren buffett saying we need this government health care
[2:11:21.380 --> 2:11:25.060]  and then when obama said oh looks like we may pass it the next few weeks
[2:11:25.060 --> 2:11:29.780]  it went back up again all the major insurance companies medical insurance
[2:11:29.780 --> 2:11:33.860]  company stock went up because this is a legislation written by
[2:11:33.860 --> 2:11:37.940]  them and simultaneously it's being reported all over the
[2:11:37.940 --> 2:11:41.620]  country medicare payment reductions worry doctors patients this is out of
[2:11:41.620 --> 2:11:45.620]  st petersburg news nine march begins with a financial
[2:11:45.620 --> 2:11:49.940]  blow for doctors who are facing major reduction of medicare payments give me
[2:11:49.940 --> 2:11:53.620]  a document cam on that for prison planet dot tv viewers
[2:11:53.620 --> 2:11:57.460]  the 21 percent reduction is the result of what some say
[2:11:57.460 --> 2:12:00.500]  is an outdated reimbursement formula from the 1990s
[2:12:00.500 --> 2:12:03.860]  over the years congress managed to waive the deficit reduction measure
[2:12:03.860 --> 2:12:08.020]  but legislatures failed to repeal it last week
[2:12:08.020 --> 2:12:12.740]  and then similar things are happening all over the country this is very
[2:12:12.740 --> 2:12:16.660]  very serious and so i wanted to get ted anderson up
[2:12:16.660 --> 2:12:19.460]  before we go to your calls for a few minutes because
[2:12:19.460 --> 2:12:23.620]  over the weekend the headline was imf chief
[2:12:23.620 --> 2:12:28.420]  Strauss con says new global currency end of the dollar
[2:12:28.420 --> 2:12:32.180]  but dollar dominance you'll still have a dollar you'll still have a euro you'll
[2:12:32.180 --> 2:12:36.420]  still have a pound you'll still have a young you'll still have a yen
[2:12:36.420 --> 2:12:41.220]  but under this new global charter that gordon brown talked about two weeks ago
[2:12:41.220 --> 2:12:43.780]  or weekend a half ago prime minister of england
[2:12:43.780 --> 2:12:48.100]  it's a charter where the banks that have taken over our nations openly
[2:12:48.100 --> 2:12:52.420]  sign agreements with each other and executive agreements unelected
[2:12:52.420 --> 2:12:59.060]  unaccountable agreements with the heads of the g20
[2:12:59.060 --> 2:13:02.500]  and four other separate central banks there's g20 but there's four others that
[2:13:02.500 --> 2:13:07.300]  met so it's 24 total i mean this is a revolution of the banking
[2:13:07.300 --> 2:13:11.700]  structure now coming out and setting up open government
[2:13:11.700 --> 2:13:16.260]  to shut off economies and bankrupt society for a post industrial world
[2:13:16.260 --> 2:13:20.420]  or neo feudalism serfdom guys pull up the definition of neo
[2:13:20.420 --> 2:13:22.980]  feudalism or serfdom for me i want to read that
[2:13:22.980 --> 2:13:26.180]  before ted leaves us here in the next 10 minutes or so
[2:13:26.180 --> 2:13:29.860]  ted anderson you know you're here obviously to promote gold
[2:13:29.860 --> 2:13:34.020]  i've shopped all over a few times i bought silver
[2:13:34.020 --> 2:13:37.780]  a decade ago from other people but you've always had the best
[2:13:37.780 --> 2:13:42.420]  deals and you bought gold when it was 1050 it's now
[2:13:42.420 --> 2:13:50.820]  1125 and and rising and i just think it's so important for
[2:13:50.820 --> 2:13:55.940]  people to take advantage of what you do because you buy it when it's dips
[2:13:55.940 --> 2:13:59.620]  and then you still sell it at the lower price when it goes up until you run out
[2:13:59.620 --> 2:14:02.420]  of supplies then you do things like give people a year
[2:14:02.420 --> 2:14:07.540]  subscription for free when they make one coin order
[2:14:07.540 --> 2:14:10.660]  of a fifth of an ounce frank i don't know if you can still offer that but
[2:14:10.660 --> 2:14:14.020]  i didn't talk to you before we went on air but you're with us but i first wanted
[2:14:14.020 --> 2:14:19.300]  you to talk about your view 30 years in the economy in the gold and
[2:14:19.300 --> 2:14:22.980]  silver brokerage business what you see happening because we've been right
[2:14:22.980 --> 2:14:27.060]  again we've been predicting all of this ted yeah you're right about that alex
[2:14:27.060 --> 2:14:30.420]  and there is um right now the the europeans are
[2:14:30.420 --> 2:14:34.660]  watching gold go up they've never seen it this high before by the way it is
[2:14:34.660 --> 2:14:38.180]  hitting a peak that they have never seen and the reason why that is is because
[2:14:38.180 --> 2:14:42.340]  there is a rally here uh just a short time ago on the u.s dollar
[2:14:42.340 --> 2:14:45.460]  against the euro when greece was in trouble
[2:14:45.460 --> 2:14:48.340]  and now the dollar is starting to slip back again
[2:14:48.340 --> 2:14:54.180]  and gold right now it did jump over that 1125 it's at 1137 30 right now
[2:14:54.180 --> 2:14:59.060]  and is seen as high as 1139 so it's really moving upwards oh i didn't know
[2:14:59.060 --> 2:15:03.860]  that so since i looked two hours ago it went to 1139
[2:15:03.860 --> 2:15:07.540]  it's definitely running right now alex and in the in british
[2:15:07.540 --> 2:15:11.860]  for the british pound and for people that are trading in the european unit
[2:15:11.860 --> 2:15:15.060]  that's right the times of london said three days ago the pound may crash in
[2:15:15.060 --> 2:15:17.620]  the next month yeah well they're looking at a peak on gold
[2:15:17.620 --> 2:15:20.660]  that they've never seen before and we'd be seeing it right now in the u.s
[2:15:20.660 --> 2:15:23.940]  dollar too except for we had this little rally let's explain that england and
[2:15:23.940 --> 2:15:27.220]  europe are seeing the highest level of gold ever
[2:15:27.220 --> 2:15:31.140]  but we're only seeing it go up some because it's all about currencies
[2:15:31.140 --> 2:15:33.940]  currencies go down the gold didn't really go up in price
[2:15:33.940 --> 2:15:37.780]  your currency is turning into toilet paper yep that's exactly what's happening
[2:15:37.780 --> 2:15:41.140]  and you look at bloomberg Reuters i mean there's a whole long list of news
[2:15:41.140 --> 2:15:44.020]  agencies out there and they're all saying the same thing
[2:15:44.020 --> 2:15:47.860]  like here's bloomberg's headline right here it says gold climbs to record in
[2:15:47.860 --> 2:15:52.340]  pound euro as investors seek haven here's one from Reuters
[2:15:52.340 --> 2:15:56.980]  gold gold gains in new york on an alternative investment to currencies
[2:15:56.980 --> 2:16:01.300]  here's another one from Reuters right here gold extends gains as dollar swings
[2:16:01.300 --> 2:16:05.060]  lower the dollars dropping right now alex and that's going to drive gold
[2:16:05.060 --> 2:16:08.500]  prices up for us here in the united states it just happens to be
[2:16:08.500 --> 2:16:13.300]  that everybody else in the western world is watching the gold prices increase
[2:16:13.300 --> 2:16:15.860]  and they've now seen a peak that's never been seen before
[2:16:15.860 --> 2:16:18.900]  and by the way bob Chapman was just saying two weeks ago
[2:16:18.900 --> 2:16:22.420]  that in two weeks it would go up i don't know how he knows this
[2:16:22.420 --> 2:16:26.180]  well you know bob Chapman's pretty darn sharp and i can tell you he could
[2:16:26.180 --> 2:16:29.940]  he could see what's going on what's developing better than a lot of other
[2:16:29.940 --> 2:16:32.020]  people can because they don't they're not
[2:16:32.020 --> 2:16:34.820]  they're not brainwashed and thinking that the economy is going to be great
[2:16:34.820 --> 2:16:38.500]  forever and uh... you know just all you got to do is take a look at the
[2:16:38.500 --> 2:16:41.620]  fundamental reasons why gold and silver go up and down
[2:16:41.620 --> 2:16:44.340]  and and realize what's going on when you see
[2:16:44.340 --> 2:16:48.340]  a country like Greece failing and then they're asking the united states and
[2:16:48.340 --> 2:16:51.140]  the european union to step in and bail them out
[2:16:51.140 --> 2:16:54.580]  you know that you know that there's trouble there and what you've got is
[2:16:54.580 --> 2:16:58.580]  jp morgan goldman sacks and others this is even in mainstream Reuters
[2:16:58.580 --> 2:17:02.260]  gobbling up different countries so that they don't scare everybody to implode
[2:17:02.260 --> 2:17:05.780]  at once they pick us off like wolves pick off sheep
[2:17:05.780 --> 2:17:09.060]  one at a time one at a time in wolf packs
[2:17:09.060 --> 2:17:12.660]  and uh... we saw the leader of the democrats
[2:17:12.660 --> 2:17:15.380]  uh... that's up on prisonplanet dot com
[2:17:15.380 --> 2:17:18.980]  uh... come out today and say the u.s could crash
[2:17:18.980 --> 2:17:23.460]  uh... like like greece i mean i mean this is getting crazier
[2:17:23.460 --> 2:17:27.700]  and crazier here's the headline house majority leader greek debt crisis can
[2:17:27.700 --> 2:17:31.700]  happen here but then he holds everybody hostage and says
[2:17:31.700 --> 2:17:36.900]  accept higher taxes to the banks or they will lower our
[2:17:36.900 --> 2:17:40.820]  triple a bond rating i mean we are held hostage by these people the only way
[2:17:40.820 --> 2:17:45.460]  you individually in my opinion get some type of uh...
[2:17:45.460 --> 2:17:49.300]  uh... uh... protection from this is gold and silver
[2:17:49.300 --> 2:17:52.660]  i mean it's so fundamental it really is
[2:17:52.660 --> 2:17:56.340]  gold and silver has been money for six thousand years and what you're watching
[2:17:56.340 --> 2:17:59.780]  is this pond game against this fiat currency
[2:17:59.780 --> 2:18:04.180]  that is going to grow weaker every day because we continue to rely on the
[2:18:04.180 --> 2:18:07.220]  printing press to bail out our problems you cannot
[2:18:07.220 --> 2:18:11.220]  continue to increase money supply without having a
[2:18:11.220 --> 2:18:15.540]  loss in purchasing power i mean it's just that's the way that the world works
[2:18:15.540 --> 2:18:19.300]  and if you know that and you see the united states government or the federal
[2:18:19.300 --> 2:18:22.340]  reserve system i mean for goodness sakes they're trying to bail out
[2:18:22.340 --> 2:18:26.900]  goldman sacks is investments that they have sitting in greece i mean
[2:18:26.900 --> 2:18:30.980]  what more does the taxpayer of the united states have to take on it
[2:18:30.980 --> 2:18:35.460]  absolutely tatted it's incredible fire out the offers for folks
[2:18:35.460 --> 2:18:38.740]  yeah right now what we have is we have the frank they've edged up a little bit
[2:18:38.740 --> 2:18:41.540]  in price there at two sixty one sixty one

[2:18:50.740 --> 2:18:53.860]  dollars per ounce that i mean you'd have to go back to the
[2:18:53.860 --> 2:18:57.620]  middle nineteen nineties to be able to buy gold at five hundred and ten dollars
[2:18:57.620 --> 2:19:01.140]  an ounce that's just a steal you mean the middle two thousands

[2:24:45.780 --> 2:24:49.860]  wing once i called in to hitler uh because i actually kind of look like him
[2:24:49.860 --> 2:24:53.460]  when i go out to uh do my protest i do a little hit
[2:24:53.460 --> 2:24:56.180]  stash and tell my youtube it's funny stuff
[2:24:56.180 --> 2:24:59.140]  what do you do go out and support hold on i mean you go out and support the
[2:24:59.140 --> 2:25:04.500]  government and say i like warrantless wiretapping and then your hitler that's
[2:25:04.500 --> 2:25:10.500]  i go out of the shock of value uh uh look to uh promote if he can act like
[2:25:10.500 --> 2:25:16.100]  hitler i can look like hitler routine oh if if if who
[2:25:16.100 --> 2:25:20.020]  can act like hitler it's the current president what's
[2:25:20.020 --> 2:25:22.740]  your website i mean what's your youtube i want to see this
[2:25:22.740 --> 2:25:27.700]  right now let's let's put it up it's it's it's gerd chapels channel
[2:25:27.700 --> 2:25:34.340]  g-e-r-g-c-h-a-p-p-l-e give me a name of one of your hitler videos
[2:25:34.340 --> 2:25:40.980]  uh let's see a good hitler hits the fair hitler hits the fair
[2:25:40.980 --> 2:25:44.740]  and okay and and because that would be a great way to illustrate a lot of people
[2:25:44.740 --> 2:25:48.900]  are now protesting with bullhorns going i love naked body scanners i love the
[2:25:48.900 --> 2:25:52.020]  new world order i love being surveilled i love the banks
[2:25:52.020 --> 2:25:56.020]  taking all my money and it's having a really powerful effect on crowds and
[2:25:56.020 --> 2:25:58.420]  they're handing out obama deceptions or other things
[2:25:58.420 --> 2:26:02.660]  and i've seen some protest videos of people coming out dressed like hitler
[2:26:02.660 --> 2:26:07.460]  it may have even been you pushing tyranny as a way to kind of shock
[2:26:07.460 --> 2:26:11.220]  people into realizing you know that tyranny doesn't always look like hitler
[2:26:11.220 --> 2:26:16.180]  but it sure acts like hitler um i mean is that what you do
[2:26:16.180 --> 2:26:20.340]  now i'd like to first thank you for saving my life because if a year ago i
[2:26:20.340 --> 2:26:23.140]  would be just sitting in the couch drinking myself to sleep because i've
[2:26:23.140 --> 2:26:27.060]  been unemployed over a year and now i'm dressed up like hitler
[2:26:27.060 --> 2:26:30.340]  right now one of the 70 percent of the unemployed carpenters turned into
[2:26:30.340 --> 2:26:35.540]  unit or a political activist and i haven't had so much fun in my life
[2:26:35.540 --> 2:26:39.860]  so what's on your mind today hitler i i created a youtube channel and i met a
[2:26:39.860 --> 2:26:42.980]  gentleman that lives here in mowgli he's writing a book it'll be published in
[2:26:42.980 --> 2:26:47.140]  the month he doesn't know you but i told him about you and he wants to meet
[2:26:47.140 --> 2:26:50.500]  you he was involved in a cover-up co-op black op
[2:26:50.500 --> 2:26:53.940]  kia something or other and he told us that hitler
[2:26:53.940 --> 2:26:56.500]  send us the info we're gonna look up your videos
[2:26:56.500 --> 2:27:01.380]  okay hitler hits the fair did did we find one all right if you really did this
[2:27:01.380 --> 2:27:05.620]  send it to me but it is a good idea i mean a way to illustrate tyranny
[2:27:05.620 --> 2:27:08.100]  like have a bunch of people dressed up like hitler
[2:27:08.100 --> 2:27:11.940]  and say you're for the body scanners and you're for more preemptive wars
[2:27:11.940 --> 2:27:16.820]  uh let's talk to herman in new york herman you're on the air
[2:27:16.820 --> 2:27:22.740]  yes hello alice can you hear me yes sir uh yes i have a two questions uh my
[2:27:22.740 --> 2:27:26.900]  first question is um i've often heard you and webster partly say that we need
[2:27:26.900 --> 2:27:31.460]  to build bridges roads high tech uh high technology
[2:27:31.460 --> 2:27:35.380]  trains etc now um how does infrastructure
[2:27:35.380 --> 2:27:38.660]  create wealth because you guys often said you know if we had great
[2:27:38.660 --> 2:27:43.540]  infrastructure we all be you know wealthy so well partly saying that if you
[2:27:43.540 --> 2:27:47.780]  haven't imploded economy you have to build infrastructure first instead of
[2:27:47.780 --> 2:27:51.380]  just giving all the money to banks that move offshore or use it to buy up
[2:27:51.380 --> 2:27:54.740]  control your local government the american
[2:27:54.740 --> 2:27:58.100]  infrastructure in the fifties was the best in the world since then
[2:27:58.100 --> 2:28:02.820]  it's been rotting and so you don't get corporations investing
[2:28:02.820 --> 2:28:06.100]  you don't you know when they build a new road you get new housing projects you
[2:28:06.100 --> 2:28:11.140]  get new malls being built new factories i mean it just goes to basic
[2:28:11.140 --> 2:28:15.700]  economics and if you have government spending and i'm not even
[2:28:15.700 --> 2:28:20.180]  for big government but if you're going to have it the spending needs to be then
[2:28:20.180 --> 2:28:23.940]  on infrastructure because then you hire local people
[2:28:23.940 --> 2:28:28.340]  when they build the infrastructure so most of the tax money
[2:28:28.340 --> 2:28:31.220]  and if there's a competitive bidding process goes back
[2:28:31.220 --> 2:28:38.420]  in to the population and it has a uh dynamo effect and i mean what's your
[2:28:38.420 --> 2:28:42.020]  take on that i definitely i understand what you're
[2:28:42.020 --> 2:28:45.780]  saying now um and my second question is um
[2:28:45.780 --> 2:28:49.220]  i know that i watched an old youtube video of you where you said how you know
[2:28:49.220 --> 2:28:53.220]  the government has two sets of books i believe it's the ca fr
[2:28:53.220 --> 2:28:56.660]  comprehensive annual financial reports exposed yes
[2:28:56.660 --> 2:29:00.900]  absolutely and um i want to know how would they allow the states to just
[2:29:00.900 --> 2:29:04.500]  collapse while they have that money sitting on the side how could they feel
[2:29:04.500 --> 2:29:06.820]  like this well what they do is they go in and take over the
[2:29:06.820 --> 2:29:10.740]  cities and counties the mafia did it in the 30s 40s and 50s in chicago
[2:29:10.740 --> 2:29:15.780]  in the late uh 40s early 50s they took the 1313 chicago model
[2:29:15.780 --> 2:29:19.540]  created double sets of books they pay off the county and city officials
[2:29:19.540 --> 2:29:22.820]  they invest most the money in private corporations
[2:29:22.820 --> 2:29:26.580]  and now they're at the end of the ponzi scheme they steal the money that was in
[2:29:26.580 --> 2:29:29.220]  those accounts implode the states and counties
[2:29:29.220 --> 2:29:33.620]  then the banks loaned them our own money back at 30 interest
[2:29:33.620 --> 2:29:38.260]  and bankrupt us to the point of nigeria or argentina
[2:29:38.260 --> 2:29:42.900]  and so that's how the scam works we'll be right back don't forget that gold deal

[2:33:51.780 --> 2:33:55.620]  so they're not even bb guns it's a little bit bigger pellet than a bb
[2:33:55.620 --> 2:33:59.620]  about i guess three times the size i've bought quite a few of these guns

[2:34:02.900 --> 2:34:08.420]  on marksmanship in the backyard and the atf in
[2:34:08.420 --> 2:34:14.980]  cornelius oregon went in to one of the local dealers of airsoft
[2:34:15.220 --> 2:34:20.340]  plastic pellet guns that they have no statutory authority nothing
[2:34:20.340 --> 2:34:27.780]  went in took the guns from customs it turns out customs called them
[2:34:27.780 --> 2:34:32.180]  the toy guns and are now claiming that they can just basically
[2:34:32.180 --> 2:34:38.100]  outside of law rule what is a firearm and we see cases where
[2:34:38.100 --> 2:34:41.300]  somebody's got an ar-15 that they bought legal it
[2:34:41.300 --> 2:34:45.300]  it has a malfunction fires two or three rounds the shooting range calls the
[2:34:45.300 --> 2:34:48.500]  police on them and in federal court they say it doesn't
[2:34:48.500 --> 2:34:53.460]  matter even if you knew you didn't know and it was a legal gun
[2:34:53.460 --> 2:34:57.780]  you're going to prison so the atf is harassing lawful gun owners
[2:34:57.780 --> 2:35:01.460]  now uh they're raiding people every day i see in the news
[2:35:01.460 --> 2:35:04.420]  neighbors will see somebody with a rifle putting their car at their house
[2:35:04.420 --> 2:35:08.100]  the police come they find five guns a thousand rounds of ammo
[2:35:08.100 --> 2:35:12.180]  there's no law against an arsenal they call an arsenal they take your guns
[2:35:12.180 --> 2:35:18.340]  arrest you without a law and so we're joined by
[2:35:18.340 --> 2:35:22.660]  brad martin of airsoft and i will give you his
[2:35:22.660 --> 2:35:29.060]  website here specifically from oregon but he and his son run this toy store
[2:35:29.060 --> 2:35:33.620]  and these are sold in walmart these are sold in academy these are sold most
[2:35:33.620 --> 2:35:38.100]  hardware stores hunting supply stores i mean this is ridiculous and for them
[2:35:38.100 --> 2:35:42.420]  to say you can cartridge and and and could build a real gun out of this
[2:35:42.420 --> 2:35:45.220]  because it looks like a gun i mean it would
[2:35:45.220 --> 2:35:48.420]  it's asinine i mean yeah if you spent two or three times the money it takes to make
[2:35:48.420 --> 2:35:52.420]  i mean to buy a real gun maybe you couldn't blow up in your face
[2:35:52.420 --> 2:35:55.780]  so he joins us to talk about all the different facets
[2:35:55.780 --> 2:35:59.860]  and angles of this and how this is just being
[2:35:59.860 --> 2:36:03.620]  selectively enforced and even the selective enforcement
[2:36:03.620 --> 2:36:06.900]  is just made up and if this is allowed to stand
[2:36:06.900 --> 2:36:12.900]  it sets an incredibly dangerous precedent because if they can ban
[2:36:12.900 --> 2:36:17.860]  BB guns that shoot plastic BBs what's going to happen to the deadly red rider
[2:36:17.860 --> 2:36:22.100]  will it be banned as an assault weapon uh so we now speak to our guest brad
[2:36:22.100 --> 2:36:25.380]  martin brad break down exactly what happened in all the latest developments
[2:36:25.380 --> 2:36:28.980]  for us well hi there mr john yeah this started
[2:36:28.980 --> 2:36:34.660]  back in october of oh nine um we we we import airsoft
[2:36:34.660 --> 2:36:39.140]  toy guns and airsoft equipment to go along with those
[2:36:39.140 --> 2:36:43.940]  and uh over the last five or six years we've had several interventions from
[2:36:43.940 --> 2:36:47.140]  customs where they've taken in the vicinity of about
[2:36:47.140 --> 2:36:50.420]  seventeen thousand dollars worth of product from us
[2:36:50.420 --> 2:36:55.300]  and you know i haven't really made a big issue out of it we just took our licks
[2:36:55.300 --> 2:36:59.060]  and kept on kept on keeping on keeping on sort of
[2:36:59.060 --> 2:37:05.540]  but bottom line is um this most recent seizure in october was
[2:37:05.540 --> 2:37:12.740]  of thirty a gas-powered m4 lookalikes and these
[2:37:12.740 --> 2:37:16.900]  these pieces are a hundred percent legitimate that they
[2:37:16.900 --> 2:37:22.420]  they're designed to fire these quarter inch plastic BBs as you described and
[2:37:22.420 --> 2:37:26.660]  that's their function well when customs receive or the
[2:37:26.660 --> 2:37:30.900]  customs receive these one or two of their agents looked at and
[2:37:30.900 --> 2:37:35.460]  decided that uh it was above their pay grade to make a call on these things
[2:37:35.460 --> 2:37:40.340]  so they called in the atf to look at them so atf took
[2:37:40.340 --> 2:37:44.420]  one or more of these things back to their laboratory in maryland or wherever
[2:37:44.420 --> 2:37:48.260]  this thing is held them for five months and then in early
[2:37:48.260 --> 2:37:52.420]  february uh after i had mailed some protest letters
[2:37:52.420 --> 2:37:55.940]  to the atf and customs i finally get a response back
[2:37:55.940 --> 2:38:00.180]  saying that i was not going to get these toy guns back
[2:38:00.180 --> 2:38:07.700]  and they they they quoted a code uh i was code number 922
[2:38:07.700 --> 2:38:11.780]  and it seems that the thing that they're seizing upon is that
[2:38:11.780 --> 2:38:15.620]  these toy guns are easily convertible
[2:38:15.620 --> 2:38:19.780]  to real steel firearms so in other words they're saying
[2:38:19.780 --> 2:38:23.300]  anybody with a little bit of effort can take these guns
[2:38:23.300 --> 2:38:27.460]  these toys and turn them into real guns and from our perspective this is just
[2:38:27.460 --> 2:38:30.180]  totally absurd
[2:38:31.780 --> 2:38:39.140]  because they look like real guns yeah yeah the other day the port director
[2:38:39.140 --> 2:38:43.780]  from customs in seattle called called all the local tv
[2:38:43.780 --> 2:38:47.460]  affiliates in and gave this news conference on
[2:38:47.460 --> 2:38:54.180]  on air holding one of our guns and and saying that this is a
[2:38:54.180 --> 2:38:58.820]  threat to the safety of america and these are made labeled them as machine guns
[2:38:58.820 --> 2:39:03.140]  and while he was talking and handling this gun of ours his toy of ours
[2:39:03.140 --> 2:39:06.660]  he was trying to stick the magazine into the magwell
[2:39:06.660 --> 2:39:11.220]  and he had the he had the magazine turned around backwards he didn't even
[2:39:11.220 --> 2:39:16.020]  know which way the bloody we're going to play a clip of this coming up
[2:39:16.020 --> 2:39:19.220]  we're going to play a clip of this coming up you've got the atf agent
[2:39:19.220 --> 2:39:24.740]  putting on this big hullabaloo trying to scare everybody
[2:39:24.740 --> 2:39:29.460]  to set the precedent to ban something that isn't even a bb gun
[2:39:29.460 --> 2:39:34.020]  because it looks scary to them my god if this is allowed to stand this is an
[2:39:34.020 --> 2:39:37.780]  incredible new precedent well it is it is scary
[2:39:37.780 --> 2:39:41.700]  you know and if this is a david and goliath scenario where you know
[2:39:41.700 --> 2:39:44.900]  i could bankrupt myself fighting the federal government still end up a
[2:39:44.900 --> 2:39:49.540]  loser here but uh you know it's time for us to stir up the pod a little bit and
[2:39:49.540 --> 2:39:53.620]  kind of try to put the brakes on this behavior
[2:39:54.500 --> 2:39:57.700]  we're going to play this video that's up on
[2:39:57.700 --> 2:40:02.100]  your website for the prison planet dot tv viewers and radio listeners
[2:40:02.100 --> 2:40:05.860]  give us your web address for folks that want to follow this case
[2:40:05.860 --> 2:40:14.180]  okay sure the web address is airsoft outlet nw.com
[2:40:14.180 --> 2:40:18.980]  so airsoft outlet northwest dot com just nw
[2:40:18.980 --> 2:40:23.860]  yeah just nw not the northwest just nw all right we're going to play
[2:40:23.860 --> 2:40:30.340]  one of the myriad of newscast trying to create a panic over the devilish
[2:40:30.340 --> 2:40:34.340]  plastic bb gun that is so scary looking
[2:40:34.340 --> 2:40:38.580]  here it is and welcome everyone and good evening i'm jeff gianola
[2:40:38.580 --> 2:40:43.620]  and i'm kelly day federal agents sees a ship of toy guns they say in the wrong
[2:40:43.620 --> 2:40:47.700]  hands they could have actually been deadly in this coin local six exclusive
[2:40:47.700 --> 2:40:50.820]  our reporter lexus del cid talked to the local businessman
[2:40:50.820 --> 2:40:54.580]  who ordered these toy guns and i see you have one there huh lexus jeff this is an
[2:40:54.580 --> 2:40:58.020]  example of one of the toy guns seized and besides the orange chip it looks
[2:40:58.020 --> 2:41:00.820]  pretty real but this is an airsoft toy it shoots
[2:41:00.820 --> 2:41:04.020]  plastic bbs and the man who ordered these says
[2:41:04.020 --> 2:41:11.060]  anyone with any knowledge of weapons should be able to figure that out
[2:41:11.060 --> 2:41:14.340]  no bullets just plastic bbs not a battlefield
[2:41:14.340 --> 2:41:18.100]  just a wooded area made to look like one it's another version of paintball
[2:41:18.100 --> 2:41:21.780]  for the past seven years brad martin and his son ben say their family business
[2:41:21.780 --> 2:41:26.580]  in cornelius has steadily grown as simulated combat gaming grows in
[2:41:26.580 --> 2:41:31.380]  popularity across the country this is the contemporary version of civil war
[2:41:31.380 --> 2:41:33.940]  reenacting while they aim for authenticity in
[2:41:33.940 --> 2:41:38.340]  every piece of gear the martins didn't anticipate a seizure by customs and
[2:41:38.340 --> 2:41:42.500]  atf agents in tecoma as their latest shipment of toy guns arrived
[2:41:42.500 --> 2:41:47.780]  from taiwan any kid any parent any adult going out of the
[2:41:47.780 --> 2:41:52.740]  house with this needs to be ready for trouble
[2:41:52.740 --> 2:41:57.460]  atf special agent kelvin cranchoff says not only is the shipment missing the
[2:41:57.460 --> 2:42:00.820]  orange tips required on all imported toy guns
[2:42:00.820 --> 2:42:06.660]  with minimal work it could be converted to a machine gun
[2:42:06.660 --> 2:42:10.260]  but say these are really convertible to machine guns is absolutely preposterous
[2:42:10.260 --> 2:42:13.300]  the round wouldn't go into the barrel for one and two if the firing pin did
[2:42:13.300 --> 2:42:16.260]  strike the primer the gun would basically blow up in your face
[2:42:16.260 --> 2:42:20.020]  also the martins say there are tens of thousands of replicas just like these
[2:42:20.020 --> 2:42:24.260]  sold in america already the only reason they buy from taiwan is because it's
[2:42:24.260 --> 2:42:27.860]  cheaper until now he spent all this manpower
[2:42:27.860 --> 2:42:35.780]  tax dollars and time and wasted my time my money my profitability
[2:42:35.780 --> 2:42:39.300]  to seize 30 toy guns that's what he's done
[2:42:39.300 --> 2:42:43.540]  and he's portrayed himself as a great hero
[2:42:43.540 --> 2:42:47.780]  but atf insists that it did the testing and determined that yes these can be
[2:42:47.780 --> 2:42:51.380]  converted into military-grade weapons the martins requested to see the
[2:42:51.380 --> 2:42:54.260]  documentation of that and they were told that they'd have to file
[2:42:54.260 --> 2:42:58.820]  a freedom of information request with atf now as for the orange tips this one
[2:42:58.820 --> 2:43:02.660]  has one the ones that came in from taiwan didn't but the martins say that's
[2:43:02.660 --> 2:43:05.940]  happened before with their shipments from taiwan and they just had to go up to
[2:43:05.940 --> 2:43:09.220]  to coma and paint the tips orange themselves so they wonder
[2:43:09.220 --> 2:43:14.180]  why this is being made into an issue now alexa still said coin local six
[2:43:14.180 --> 2:43:17.780]  okay and we have brad martin online with us so
[2:43:17.780 --> 2:43:21.460]  you've got an atf officer in a fancy suit who can't even
[2:43:21.460 --> 2:43:26.020]  put the cartridge in it he can't put the magazine in it shoots little bitty
[2:43:26.020 --> 2:43:30.660]  round plastic bbs that are looked like they're even smaller in 22 caliber
[2:43:30.660 --> 2:43:33.540]  there's no room for a cartridge to go in there's no
[2:43:33.540 --> 2:43:37.620]  room for propellant now he uses air to shoot plastic
[2:43:37.620 --> 2:43:41.460]  bbs and what's really happening i saw this five years ago or so in england
[2:43:41.460 --> 2:43:44.900]  where they're trying to ban these over there they don't like the gun
[2:43:44.900 --> 2:43:48.660]  culture growing because this is a gateway to real firearms
[2:43:48.660 --> 2:43:52.180]  people are finding out how much fun it is to target shoot
[2:43:52.180 --> 2:43:56.660]  or to dress up in gear and you know go to the equivalent of paintball ranges
[2:43:56.660 --> 2:44:01.220]  i you know run around with my children you know in the backyard and shoot
[2:44:01.220 --> 2:44:05.300]  targets and shoot 10 cans and you learn how to be a good marksman
[2:44:05.300 --> 2:44:09.380]  then they graduate to bb guns and they graduate to real firearms
[2:44:09.380 --> 2:44:13.780]  and to this is incredible this is lawlessness and you told me off air
[2:44:13.780 --> 2:44:17.060]  that you've talked to other atf branches and they're like we can't believe
[2:44:17.060 --> 2:44:20.180]  this happened that these aren't real firearms we don't
[2:44:20.180 --> 2:44:25.620]  we don't have a statutory authority but it doesn't matter there in your area
[2:44:25.620 --> 2:44:29.860]  they're just going to do whatever they want and i guess if they don't have a
[2:44:29.860 --> 2:44:33.460]  law they don't care because he says you go outside with this you're looking
[2:44:33.460 --> 2:44:37.860]  you're looking for trouble he feels like you shouldn't have this as a slave
[2:44:37.860 --> 2:44:41.220]  and so he's going to take them that's the end of it doesn't matter if it's 30
[2:44:41.220 --> 2:44:45.940]  thousand dollar shipment doesn't matter because they run this country now
[2:44:45.940 --> 2:44:50.580]  yep that's exactly right i have been after about three months of this
[2:44:50.580 --> 2:44:55.540]  seizure going on i started writing letters and calling people i talked to uh
[2:44:55.540 --> 2:44:59.060]  an agent back in maryland i believe it was
[2:44:59.060 --> 2:45:05.220]  who was uh in the atf division of firearms importations
[2:45:05.220 --> 2:45:11.060]  and i explained the situation to her and she said well why did atf take airsoft
[2:45:11.060 --> 2:45:15.620]  and i said well i guess because they can and she said well atf has no
[2:45:15.620 --> 2:45:19.620]  jurisdiction over over airsoft and if you would like to
[2:45:19.620 --> 2:45:23.860]  if you would give my telephone number meaning her telephone number
[2:45:23.860 --> 2:45:27.780]  to the local atf people and tell them to call her
[2:45:27.780 --> 2:45:31.940]  she would inform them that they have no jurisdiction over airsoft
[2:45:31.940 --> 2:45:36.260]  now again i didn't dissuade them we're gonna oh that didn't dissuade them so
[2:45:36.260 --> 2:45:41.620]  so no no so so explain who you separately talked to atatf
[2:45:41.620 --> 2:45:46.100]  who was uh what her position is and then what they said because we want to write
[2:45:46.100 --> 2:45:50.820]  an article about this yeah well exactly and i can provide you with a phone
[2:45:50.820 --> 2:45:53.940]  number at some future i don't have it with me right here
[2:45:53.940 --> 2:45:59.940]  but as i mentioned after going through after calling the atf back east and
[2:45:59.940 --> 2:46:04.420]  explaining my situation to about four or five people i finally got
[2:46:04.420 --> 2:46:08.260]  to this agent in as i mentioned the division
[2:46:08.260 --> 2:46:12.660]  of firearms importation and i explained it to her
[2:46:12.660 --> 2:46:18.100]  and she said we have no we have no jurisdiction over airsoft
[2:46:18.100 --> 2:46:22.340]  so well sir what the atf controls by by ruling
[2:46:22.340 --> 2:46:26.340]  that's that's what they do they they see something they don't need a law about it
[2:46:26.340 --> 2:46:30.260]  they just make a ruling yeah let me let me expand on that
[2:46:30.260 --> 2:46:35.300]  let me expand on that yeah this is a commerce issue you've been robbed
[2:46:35.300 --> 2:46:40.020]  when an officer federal or state operates clearly outside their jurisdiction
[2:46:40.020 --> 2:46:44.420]  consciously through color of law you have been physically robbed and so you
[2:46:44.420 --> 2:46:49.140]  file a criminal police report that you've been robbed
[2:46:49.140 --> 2:46:53.460]  well in essence i wrote to i wrote to them and i said you know
[2:46:53.460 --> 2:46:57.220]  what's happening with this shipment why am i getting no information about this
[2:46:57.220 --> 2:46:59.460]  because they're included they're incredibly
[2:46:59.460 --> 2:47:03.860]  secretly they don't they don't give you any information no judge no jury no
[2:47:03.860 --> 2:47:07.380]  indictment no interview no arrest no paperwork
[2:47:07.380 --> 2:47:10.980]  just your 30 000 of toy guns is gone pal
[2:47:10.980 --> 2:47:14.100]  we don't need no stinking warrants or paperwork
[2:47:14.100 --> 2:47:18.820]  we rule america you don't sell toy guns around here boy
[2:47:18.820 --> 2:47:22.900]  absolutely that's right and i figured that if they really thought my guns were
[2:47:22.900 --> 2:47:27.460]  machine guns like they said they were i'd be in handcuffs by now
[2:47:27.460 --> 2:47:31.620]  but they're not down here arrested me um and they're not
[2:47:31.620 --> 2:47:37.940]  in other vendors stores this is sold at walmart academy
[2:47:37.940 --> 2:47:42.660]  everywhere the exact same fake m16 plastic toy guns
[2:47:42.660 --> 2:47:45.540]  people are running around with these having a great time
[2:47:45.540 --> 2:47:49.940]  and it's buoying the gun culture and i think this is an atf case
[2:47:49.940 --> 2:47:53.940]  on purpose uh from the obama administration we confirmed in austin
[2:47:53.940 --> 2:47:57.940]  they shut down a gun show with no law to set a national precedent
[2:47:57.940 --> 2:48:01.460]  and i believe they picked you as a small independent dealer

[2:55:14.340 --> 2:55:18.340]  i mean this is like more than orwellian it's surreal like a comedy
[2:55:18.340 --> 2:55:21.620]  the news holding up a gun with a red tip a little
[2:55:21.620 --> 2:55:26.980]  toy toy plastic machine gun saying oh my gosh it's so scary and an atf guy will
[2:55:26.980 --> 2:55:29.860]  put his picture up there you know looking like he's in deep
[2:55:29.860 --> 2:55:33.380]  fear over all this i mean if they can get toy guns
[2:55:33.380 --> 2:55:37.380]  nothing safe it's true the truth you know i was
[2:55:37.380 --> 2:55:42.340]  talking i went over to the local coffee shop for a cup this morning and uh
[2:55:42.340 --> 2:55:47.060]  the police chief from the open martin was in there
[2:55:47.060 --> 2:55:52.740]  and off the record not as not as police chief but he's 100 behind us on this
[2:55:52.740 --> 2:55:56.340]  and he and i were talking and he was saying that that
[2:55:56.340 --> 2:56:00.660]  americans are afraid of everything and and the government
[2:56:00.660 --> 2:56:04.740]  wants to protect us from everything that's even a little bit scary and
[2:56:04.740 --> 2:56:08.980]  basically that's what's happening here you know this creeping totalitarianism
[2:56:08.980 --> 2:56:12.900]  of the government wanting to have their fingers and control everything
[2:56:12.900 --> 2:56:16.420]  and it's uh it's just it's just got to stop somewhere i don't know where it
[2:56:16.420 --> 2:56:20.260]  stops but we got to do something about it well look at this atf officer
[2:56:20.260 --> 2:56:23.460]  what is his name clevin throwing back up on screen
[2:56:23.460 --> 2:56:26.420]  clevin krenshaw i mean he's in what looks like a
[2:56:26.420 --> 2:56:32.100]  $2,000 suit taxpayer paid for you know he's a beautiful suit he's wearing i gotta
[2:56:32.100 --> 2:56:37.940]  say yeah i mean this is a stunt for him a stunt from the atf guaranteed obama's
[2:56:37.940 --> 2:56:41.300]  pushing this and he's he's here trampling on your
[2:56:41.300 --> 2:56:46.820]  right to commerce they've now got $50,000 of your toy guns
[2:56:46.820 --> 2:56:49.860]  and they just think you're not even human i mean
[2:56:49.860 --> 2:56:54.100]  taking yeah doing this to you it's like you don't even exist
[2:56:54.100 --> 2:56:57.700]  that's so true you know it's like since when
[2:56:57.700 --> 2:57:03.620]  does it is it a crime against a vendor who brings in a legal product
[2:57:03.620 --> 2:57:09.460]  and somebody somewhere some wacko decides that he's going to convert that
[2:57:09.460 --> 2:57:15.460]  legal product into something illegal why does that make it the vendors crime
[2:57:15.460 --> 2:57:19.380]  that he's brought in a legal product and that's by the way
[2:57:19.380 --> 2:57:24.180]  i i own some of these you mean it converts something that's air powered
[2:57:24.180 --> 2:57:28.180]  and and and doesn't even have the mechanism to you know put in a cartridge
[2:57:28.180 --> 2:57:31.380]  that has powder that projects it i mean this is asinine
[2:57:31.380 --> 2:57:34.740]  i mean i mean sure if you went to a top machinist
[2:57:34.740 --> 2:57:38.180]  maybe they could build something that would chamber around but then this is
[2:57:38.180 --> 2:57:42.340]  10 metal it would blow up well that's that is that's our point
[2:57:42.340 --> 2:57:49.220]  too and and if if a guy wanted an ar-15 or an m4
[2:57:49.220 --> 2:57:55.220]  he could go to his local gun store and pay a thousand bucks and get a dependable
[2:57:55.220 --> 2:57:58.660]  platform instead of going to an airsoft store
[2:57:58.660 --> 2:58:01.940]  and paying probably around $500 for this product
[2:58:01.940 --> 2:58:06.900]  spending all kinds of time and energy trying to convert this into a gun that's
[2:58:06.900 --> 2:58:11.540]  going to blow it up into his face it's totally illogical this is you agree
[2:58:11.540 --> 2:58:15.700]  with me though that they've been trying to kill the gun culture and that airsoft
[2:58:15.700 --> 2:58:20.580]  is literally one of the and i noticed this years ago one of the key things
[2:58:20.580 --> 2:58:24.500]  getting people into the gun culture i i think you're right i think they're
[2:58:24.500 --> 2:58:26.900]  scared of i think they're scared of an armed
[2:58:26.900 --> 2:58:31.060]  electorate is what they're scared of i tell you what i know you've got to go
[2:58:31.060 --> 2:58:34.500]  but we're going to break for one minute let's do five more so we can talk
[2:58:34.500 --> 2:58:37.060]  about this creeping totalitarianism with you
[2:58:37.060 --> 2:58:43.300]  then it's open phones and news blitz for the rest of the final hour

[2:59:34.820 --> 2:59:38.340]  and right now in washington dc we have seen

[3:00:29.540 --> 3:00:33.300]  quite easy to convert absolutely made up
[3:00:33.300 --> 3:00:38.100]  it's an air powered plastic pellet system
[3:00:38.100 --> 3:00:42.500]  anybody that knows about guns and knows about BB guns or air guns this is an
[3:00:42.500 --> 3:00:47.540]  asinine joke but this is the domestication of the
[3:00:47.540 --> 3:00:49.780]  population you know they ban people in england
[3:00:49.780 --> 3:00:53.700]  defending themselves in their own home with a baseball bat or with a butcher knife

[3:00:57.540 --> 3:01:00.660]  in your house so the criminals and the government can come in

[3:01:58.420 --> 3:02:01.940]  attorney general two years ago before he was even in office for the
[3:02:01.940 --> 3:02:07.380]  justice department argued there is no civilian right to own any firearms
[3:02:07.380 --> 3:02:11.380]  obama as a state senator was for total ban of guns
[3:02:11.380 --> 3:02:14.740]  they're moving against the second amendment on all fronts but then saying
[3:02:14.740 --> 3:02:18.260]  stop buying record amounts of firearms we don't want your guns
[3:02:18.260 --> 3:02:21.860]  they're shutting down gun shows illegally they're grabbing plastic
[3:02:21.860 --> 3:02:26.900]  pellet bb guns illegally i think this guy will actually get promoted to say tf
[3:02:26.900 --> 3:02:31.220]  guy this is the type of guy they want um
[3:02:31.220 --> 3:02:35.780]  but this is a big wake-up call yeah that's a guy i've made that comment that

[3:02:56.180 --> 3:03:01.380]  condemning us for you know the tyranny against the country it's just
[3:03:01.380 --> 3:03:05.860]  everything is so upside down it's incredible well this is a revolution by
[3:03:05.860 --> 3:03:10.500]  the collectivist by the control freaks and they can't
[3:03:10.500 --> 3:03:16.260]  stand it that we're not disarmed yeah couldn't agree more

[3:03:34.500 --> 3:03:39.940]  dot com and so you had the atf column from the east and say you have no
[3:03:39.940 --> 3:03:43.380]  jurisdiction and you said they just don't care i mean when you call them
[3:03:43.380 --> 3:03:46.500]  do they respond you said they won't give you paperwork i mean that's even more
[3:03:46.500 --> 3:03:50.660]  outrageous just it's like the airports now grab your laptop and won't give it
[3:03:50.660 --> 3:03:55.300]  back well i was mentioning this atf agent i spoke
[3:03:55.300 --> 3:03:58.740]  to a week or so ago who seemed like a really level headed fella
[3:03:58.740 --> 3:04:02.740]  and he was the one that told me that customs has my company flagged for all
[3:04:02.740 --> 3:04:05.620]  imports now but also he told me
[3:04:05.620 --> 3:04:11.940]  that uh that i would most likely have to file under the freedom of information
[3:04:11.940 --> 3:04:15.780]  act in order to try to get their laboratory results
[3:04:15.780 --> 3:04:20.020]  and yeah i would i've been reading up on the freedom of information act and
[3:04:20.020 --> 3:04:23.540]  there are something like nine exemptions that various
[3:04:23.540 --> 3:04:28.020]  governmental agencies can claim to withhold reports from you
[3:04:28.020 --> 3:04:32.820]  so i fully expect that upon my petition for freedom of information that they
[3:04:32.820 --> 3:04:36.420]  will hide behind one of these exemptions oh yeah they could they could go into a
[3:04:36.420 --> 3:04:39.220]  five and dime and confiscate all their water
[3:04:39.220 --> 3:04:42.740]  guns and say it could be easily converted into a nuclear weapon
[3:04:42.740 --> 3:04:46.740]  yeah yeah or they can be you can put acid in those and squirt acid in
[3:04:46.740 --> 3:04:50.660]  somebody's face i mean anything can be turned into a weapon

[3:05:10.500 --> 3:05:13.540]  and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream
[3:05:13.540 --> 3:05:17.540]  by breathing the solution through the lungs the respiratory system is the
[3:05:17.540 --> 3:05:20.820]  first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses
[3:05:20.820 --> 3:05:24.260]  the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system
[3:05:24.260 --> 3:05:28.660]  with your self-produced nano silver solutions and also delivers
[3:05:28.660 --> 3:05:32.340]  the silver nano particles instantly into the bloodstream
[3:05:32.340 --> 3:05:36.420]  with continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products
[3:05:36.420 --> 3:05:39.940]  you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver
[3:05:39.940 --> 3:05:44.420]  with the silver lungs generator very easy to follow step by step instructions

[3:06:20.180 --> 3:06:23.860]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country
[3:06:23.860 --> 3:06:28.340]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[3:06:28.340 --> 3:06:32.180]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[3:06:32.180 --> 3:06:35.300]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose

[3:08:20.820 --> 3:08:25.300]  remember the european union parliament from england he's refused to apologize
[3:08:25.300 --> 3:08:28.820]  there's the prison planet dot com headline a joking headline

[3:08:40.260 --> 3:08:43.460]  gotten to yet uh... that we're gonna be breaking down
[3:08:43.460 --> 3:08:45.780]  but i want to go to your calls when we have each caller about a minute and a
[3:08:45.780 --> 3:08:49.700]  half go to the next person we're gonna go to bob in ohio first bob you're on the
[3:08:49.700 --> 3:08:53.700]  year and it's an honor alexey uh...
[3:08:53.700 --> 3:08:57.380]  ex-veteran just a quick rundown what they know
[3:08:57.380 --> 3:09:01.300]  down the road is they're going to implode the economy even worse
[3:09:01.300 --> 3:09:06.020]  when you got half of detroit not want to finish high school
[3:09:06.020 --> 3:09:10.500]  okay when they implode half of detroit is uh... out of work
[3:09:10.500 --> 3:09:14.660]  yeah i know that too but when they really implode the economy
[3:09:14.660 --> 3:09:17.940]  because they refuse to address napkin gap
[3:09:17.940 --> 3:09:22.100]  force uh... do a little protectionism for american workers
[3:09:22.100 --> 3:09:26.260]  and manufacturing industry protectionism built this country
[3:09:26.260 --> 3:09:29.380]  and they know and the roving hordes of
[3:09:29.380 --> 3:09:33.220]  criminals they're going to try to take our guns so we can't protect ourselves
[3:09:33.220 --> 3:09:38.100]  and then make us go along with the police i am a very strong supporter of you
[3:09:38.100 --> 3:09:42.900]  and for people having guns but if you remember braveheart
[3:09:42.900 --> 3:09:48.260]  the uncle car carlile uh... said to the young boy mel Gibson
[3:09:48.260 --> 3:09:53.300]  uh... when he was a child he said first he capped him in the head first learned
[3:09:53.300 --> 3:09:56.500]  to use this and then he pointed to the sword and
[3:09:56.500 --> 3:09:59.620]  held the sword and then i'll teach you how to use
[3:09:59.620 --> 3:10:03.540]  this and i am a very strong gun supporter
[3:10:03.540 --> 3:10:09.060]  and i'm glad you brought that uh... talking point up about the gun show
[3:10:09.060 --> 3:10:13.060]  because what they're doing is they're getting ready to really make things
[3:10:13.060 --> 3:10:17.380]  really believe they're grabbing toy guns that don't even shoot bbs
[3:10:17.380 --> 3:10:23.220]  well metal babies yes because what they need to do is get the replicas off
[3:10:23.220 --> 3:10:27.460]  the market because it's going to get so bad in this country people
[3:10:27.460 --> 3:10:32.020]  and children and women are going to start using replicas
[3:10:32.020 --> 3:10:36.420]  and all to scare people away exactly because at a great point bob i
[3:10:36.420 --> 3:10:38.980]  appreciate your call that's exactly what's happening
[3:10:38.980 --> 3:10:42.100]  it's growing the gun culture because a lot of people are too afraid to buy a
[3:10:42.100 --> 3:10:45.380]  BB gun they're too afraid to buy a real firearm
[3:10:45.380 --> 3:10:49.860]  so it goes BB guns firearms but below that you've got these
[3:10:49.860 --> 3:10:53.540]  paintballs and i've seen the feds going after those
[3:10:53.540 --> 3:10:57.780]  and that are air powered and going after these air soft
[3:10:57.780 --> 3:11:02.260]  that shoot the little plastic pellets and people are having wars with them
[3:11:02.260 --> 3:11:05.460]  they're learning marksmanship look here's the deal
[3:11:05.460 --> 3:11:08.740]  why do i support the apple seed movement the firearms training for
[3:11:08.740 --> 3:11:12.340]  citizens everywhere because we're relearning our heritage
[3:11:12.340 --> 3:11:16.580]  i mean when i was 14 folks i've been shooting guns since i was four years
[3:11:16.580 --> 3:11:21.460]  old and i really got into it and i could shoot to the same hole
[3:11:21.460 --> 3:11:25.140]  on a good day at 200 yards if there wasn't any wind
[3:11:25.140 --> 3:11:28.100]  but i mean i'm not exaggerating i could shoot
[3:11:28.100 --> 3:11:34.580]  through the same hole now 200 yards i can you know shoot a pattern about that
[3:11:34.580 --> 3:11:38.020]  big would say a 30 odd six i'm still a great marksman i can
[3:11:38.020 --> 3:11:40.900]  few times i got to go deer hunting i won't even shoot deer up close or wild
[3:11:40.900 --> 3:11:44.660]  hogs i'll wait till i see one 600 yards away
[3:11:44.660 --> 3:11:53.060]  because i want a little bit of a little bit of challenge
[3:11:53.780 --> 3:11:57.780]  and what i really learned to shoot good with was a 22 rifle single shot
[3:11:57.780 --> 3:12:01.700]  just walking around out in the woods out in the hills and
[3:12:01.700 --> 3:12:05.620]  dales of our family ranch where my dad learned to shoot where his dad
[3:12:05.620 --> 3:12:07.780]  learned to shoot where his dad learned to shoot
[3:12:07.780 --> 3:12:11.060]  you know all the way back and the women those
[3:12:11.060 --> 3:12:15.060]  those free people out there and women wazing to see those
[3:12:15.060 --> 3:12:25.780]  those free people
[3:12:25.780 --> 3:12:29.300]  out there and women were tough and women were strong and and and women
[3:12:29.300 --> 3:12:32.820]  defended themselves and when america did go to war
[3:12:32.820 --> 3:12:36.980]  everyone the germans in world war one were terrified
[3:12:36.980 --> 3:12:40.740]  of americans because it didn't matter if you were from new york or texas
[3:12:40.740 --> 3:12:45.380]  or tennessee or california americans were just dreaded
[3:12:45.380 --> 3:12:49.860]  dreaded because germans weren't brought up
[3:12:49.860 --> 3:12:53.140]  compared to americans shooting as many firearms because they didn't let you
[3:12:53.140 --> 3:12:56.020]  know their slaves be armed only the wealthy really had the money and the
[3:12:56.020 --> 3:12:59.620]  licenses to hunt and you know the germans were tough
[3:12:59.620 --> 3:13:02.900]  and fought and were intelligent fighters but
[3:13:02.900 --> 3:13:05.380]  you know they could brush the british aside they could brush the french
[3:13:05.380 --> 3:13:09.140]  aside they could brush the russians aside but when the americans showed up
[3:13:09.140 --> 3:13:14.020]  it was doom since then they destroyed much of the
[3:13:14.020 --> 3:13:17.700]  gun culture gotten people in big cities banned the high school
[3:13:17.700 --> 3:13:21.460]  shooting clubs that even new york city had just 20 years ago
[3:13:21.460 --> 3:13:25.540]  and so mothers get scared of guns they get scared of bb guns oh my kid can't
[3:13:25.540 --> 3:13:28.660]  have a bb gun you'll shoot your eye out and yeah if your kids got bb guns and
[3:13:28.660 --> 3:13:31.540]  was bad kids with no training that will happen
[3:13:31.540 --> 3:13:34.740]  just like running in the street will happen with no training and i said i go
[3:13:34.740 --> 3:13:37.860]  to your calls but now i'm ranting on this subject
[3:13:37.860 --> 3:13:43.300]  but really the last five years but i really noticed the last two
[3:13:43.300 --> 3:13:46.340]  masses of people are getting into airsoft i mean you go
[3:13:46.340 --> 3:13:49.460]  to walmart you go which i never go to but i've seen it there the few times i've
[3:13:49.460 --> 3:13:54.100]  been there you go to academy where i go big sporting goods channel over texas
[3:13:54.100 --> 3:13:58.260]  they've got double aisles in the sporting goods
[3:13:58.260 --> 3:14:01.940]  of airsoft i mean people are while you're there just grabbing them buying them
[3:14:01.940 --> 3:14:05.300]  i tried to buy some more at christmas almost everything was sold out
[3:14:05.300 --> 3:14:08.980]  and you've got women grabbing them men grabbing them and they're going out
[3:14:08.980 --> 3:14:11.780]  they're shooting them they're learning marksmanship then they're buying real
[3:14:11.780 --> 3:14:15.540]  guns and it's this doorway into the gun
[3:14:15.540 --> 3:14:19.780]  culture that they cannot stand
[3:14:19.780 --> 3:14:23.540]  ten years ago in texas they tried to pass a law banning junior olympics banning
[3:14:23.540 --> 3:14:27.140]  four-eight shooting clubs banning ymca shooting clubs banning people under the
[3:14:27.140 --> 3:14:30.020]  age of 18 being a part of this we beat that bill
[3:14:30.020 --> 3:14:33.620]  they've they've tried it all over the country they want to kill the gun culture
[3:14:33.620 --> 3:14:37.860]  and all the polls show the majority of people are swinging back to a pro gun
[3:14:37.860 --> 3:14:41.460]  culture they were drinking the kool-aid 20 30 years ago
[3:14:41.460 --> 3:14:46.020]  and they're panicking and so the atf just lawlessly shows up
[3:14:46.020 --> 3:14:50.020]  and says i say you can't have this toy gun and just does it
[3:14:50.020 --> 3:14:53.620]  it's illegal you heard him he talked to the head atf
[3:14:53.620 --> 3:14:58.100]  regulation import people in in dc and they said what on earth
[3:14:58.100 --> 3:15:02.260]  you give him my number you tell him you know call me
[3:15:02.260 --> 3:15:05.380]  and he calls up and tells them they don't even want to hear it
[3:15:05.380 --> 3:15:09.940]  so they're showing us who they are and they cannot
[3:15:09.940 --> 3:15:15.860]  stand you and folks buy a book on gun safety or go to a gun
[3:15:15.860 --> 3:15:19.620]  shooting range pay a guy you know 30 bucks that works there
[3:15:19.620 --> 3:15:26.100]  to give you an hour lesson because even with airsoft or anything
[3:15:26.100 --> 3:15:29.620]  you must train your children first how the gun works
[3:15:29.620 --> 3:15:34.100]  you must show them how to use it they must do it the first 10 or 15 times you
[3:15:34.100 --> 3:15:36.740]  take them out the backyard to shoot the airsoft
[3:15:36.740 --> 3:15:41.940]  or wherever you go shoot it uh shooting at tin cans or whatever the case is
[3:15:41.940 --> 3:15:45.700]  that if they don't do everything just right hold at their side never aiming
[3:15:45.700 --> 3:15:48.900]  at anyone then the first time they do something
[3:15:48.900 --> 3:15:51.300]  wrong you say i'm taking it away from you for a week
[3:15:51.300 --> 3:15:54.980]  and then they'll remember then you train them on that you train them as if it's a
[3:15:54.980 --> 3:15:58.660]  real gun once you've learned basic safety yourself for those that aren't in the
[3:15:58.660 --> 3:16:02.580]  culture of liberty we want you to join us it's an open hand
[3:16:02.580 --> 3:16:07.860]  stand with george washington in 1776 be an armed free person
[3:16:07.860 --> 3:16:12.340]  and then after they know their gun safety for a year with an airsoft get
[3:16:12.340 --> 3:16:15.460]  them a bb gun only let them take it out lock it up
[3:16:15.460 --> 3:16:19.220]  when you're with them and they will be completely gun safety
[3:16:19.220 --> 3:16:23.060]  for the rest of their lives it's like dog training you must
[3:16:23.060 --> 3:16:26.740]  pass on the liberty you must pass the sword on
[3:16:26.740 --> 3:16:30.500]  generation after generation you must not allow them to gelge you
[3:16:30.500 --> 3:16:34.500]  to to castrate you okay i just spent 10 minutes on that let's go to calls
[3:16:34.500 --> 3:16:38.740]  scott and arizona you're on the air hey alex thanks for taking the call
[3:16:38.740 --> 3:16:42.180]  hey um i know it's been a little while since i think you've had uh
[3:16:42.180 --> 3:16:46.900]  dr lebo on and i just want to bring to everybody's attention the um
[3:16:46.900 --> 3:16:50.740]  the wonderful uh john mccain who's running reelection commercials here in
[3:16:50.740 --> 3:16:54.020]  arizona talking about how he's not for big business and how he's fighting
[3:16:54.020 --> 3:16:59.700]  obama has introduced this uh dietary supplement safety act
[3:16:59.700 --> 3:17:03.540]  and um there is a i don't know if dr lebo has
[3:17:03.540 --> 3:17:07.540]  information on her foundation website to take direct action but there is a
[3:17:07.540 --> 3:17:11.140]  website i have no affiliation with them but it's uh
[3:17:11.140 --> 3:17:18.020]  triple w dot lef dot org lef stands for life extension foundation and they
[3:17:18.020 --> 3:17:21.860]  have an article about this and what this act is set up to do
[3:17:21.860 --> 3:17:26.500]  which is basically uh it's a step in the wrong direction in
[3:17:26.500 --> 3:17:29.460]  well mccain's introduced as you know legislation
[3:17:29.460 --> 3:17:32.660]  to restrict mainline vitamins under codex alimentarius
[3:17:32.660 --> 3:17:36.100]  it just happened a month ago in canada this is really happening
[3:17:36.100 --> 3:17:40.980]  yeah it is it is and this uh this particular act basically says that
[3:17:40.980 --> 3:17:47.060]  if the fda suspects that there could be a problem with the product with a
[3:17:47.060 --> 3:17:51.380]  particular supplement they can take full control
[3:17:51.380 --> 3:17:55.860]  over that supplement yank it off the shelves give it over to the pharmaceuticals
[3:17:55.860 --> 3:17:59.860]  under use patents and this supports completely putting
[3:17:59.860 --> 3:18:04.500]  dietary just like the atf is is been given phony power to do over at once
[3:18:04.500 --> 3:18:06.980]  outside law just like the environmental protection
[3:18:06.980 --> 3:18:10.740]  agencies listing carbon dioxide as a deadly nerve weapon the most deadly
[3:18:10.740 --> 3:18:13.540]  thing ever known i mean they're just it's ridiculous
[3:18:13.540 --> 3:18:17.140]  congress won't pass the law so they just do it great points in fact i keep
[3:18:17.140 --> 3:18:20.740]  meaning to cover that mccain act we got search engine forming will cover it
[3:18:20.740 --> 3:18:24.740]  coming up at for some more calls uh mccain bill to restrict supplements it's
[3:18:24.740 --> 3:18:28.100]  been all over the mainstream news and then there was that toronto star
[3:18:28.100 --> 3:18:33.540]  article about uh pharmacies told to pull supplements off shelves they just said
[3:18:33.540 --> 3:18:39.060]  period this all must be prescription and you've got the big pharma companies
[3:18:39.060 --> 3:18:42.660]  patenting fish oil patenting vitamin c
[3:18:42.660 --> 3:18:47.540]  patenting this so you have to pay hundreds of dollars for fish oil or
[3:18:47.540 --> 3:18:51.300]  hundreds of dollars for vitamin c or malaleuca oil
[3:18:51.300 --> 3:18:56.020]  or one of the big ones they're going after is aloe vera

[3:19:36.820 --> 3:19:40.740]  no i don't know about what kevin trudeau says but uh i don't really remember
[3:19:40.740 --> 3:19:43.700]  that but i'll look into it but your other question
[3:19:43.700 --> 3:19:47.060]  was very very important know what was the first question again it was about the
[3:19:47.060 --> 3:19:49.540]  north american union if there's all the

[3:24:55.540 --> 3:24:58.020]  for a north american union towards the union and
[3:24:58.020 --> 3:25:02.260]  vincente fox has been on cnn and said it is a north american union
[3:25:02.260 --> 3:25:06.820]  and if you notice they have cross military agreements cross drug
[3:25:06.820 --> 3:25:10.180]  trafficking interdiction agreements cutting off their competition
[3:25:10.180 --> 3:25:14.180]  they have agreements on trade they have internal trade ports with mexico
[3:25:14.180 --> 3:25:18.580]  and the napa superhighways the big leg of it in texas
[3:25:18.580 --> 3:25:23.220]  they just renamed it last year but i was saw dallas morning news sunday
[3:25:23.220 --> 3:25:26.820]  when i was at dan's hamburgers driving home hitting a hamburger and i i didn't
[3:25:26.820 --> 3:25:29.620]  have a dollar fifty to buy the sunday paper of change but
[3:25:29.620 --> 3:25:32.980]  i saw it in the in the in the in the paper machine
[3:25:32.980 --> 3:25:37.220]  it said uh... all this big uh... highway that wasn't going to be a toll road in
[3:25:37.220 --> 3:25:39.780]  dallas is going to be one it was part of the
[3:25:39.780 --> 3:25:45.060]  texas trans texas corridor uh... part of the napa superhighway system but now
[3:25:45.060 --> 3:25:48.020]  it's it's just been named something different so what they did is they
[3:25:48.020 --> 3:25:51.540]  stopped branding it as the big north american superhighway
[3:25:51.540 --> 3:25:56.340]  and they just call it now uh... legs of it
[3:25:56.340 --> 3:25:59.540]  oh we won't make this road outside austin the toll road since the legislature said
[3:25:59.540 --> 3:26:02.180]  no and since taxpayers already paid for it
[3:26:02.180 --> 3:26:05.780]  it is now oh we're not going to build these eight thousand miles of roads or
[3:26:05.780 --> 3:26:09.220]  seize eight thousand miles of roads in texas and put toll roads on it we won't
[3:26:09.220 --> 3:26:12.340]  call it the trans texas corridor anymore but we're just going to go ahead and do
[3:26:12.340 --> 3:26:16.020]  it i remember early two thousand and nine it was in the
[3:26:16.020 --> 3:26:21.140]  associated press uh... that pull up the headline trans texas corridor
[3:26:21.140 --> 3:26:25.380]  cancelled and then the third paragraph down
[3:26:25.380 --> 3:26:29.220]  in the headline trans texas corridor cancelled it said
[3:26:29.220 --> 3:26:32.740]  the new plan is to no longer have that name
[3:26:32.740 --> 3:26:39.060]  but build them each as a piece in pieces and take over existing roads no longer
[3:26:39.060 --> 3:26:44.260]  under the the high publicity name and so out of depression out of
[3:26:44.260 --> 3:26:48.260]  recession if you read the sbp documents the judicial watch got that we cover
[3:26:48.260 --> 3:26:52.260]  an end game they said out of the threat of terror out of
[3:26:52.260 --> 3:26:56.660]  economic collapse out of a flu pandemic

[3:27:12.580 --> 3:27:15.860]  they always get more federal control the feds order to stand down at katrina
[3:27:15.860 --> 3:27:19.380]  then they say oh we screwed up we need more funds we need more power

[3:27:41.140 --> 3:27:45.220]  like fact sheet and stand there and hand them out and talk to everybody who
[3:27:45.220 --> 3:27:49.060]  comes in or goes in more fluoride that's why you're upset
[3:27:49.060 --> 3:27:53.220]  drink your extra fluoride you'll start feeling better
[3:27:53.220 --> 3:27:57.460]  that's pretty much what they claim well give the name of your town again
[3:27:57.460 --> 3:28:00.340]  everybody should go who's listening in that surrounding area and say
[3:28:00.340 --> 3:28:03.620]  stop force medicating even if you believe fluoride
[3:28:03.620 --> 3:28:06.900]  is good for your teeth which the american dental association three years ago
[3:28:06.900 --> 3:28:09.540]  said kids under six shouldn't do it gives you dental
[3:28:09.540 --> 3:28:14.020]  phlerosis weakens your teeth uh... safer sunburn
[3:28:14.020 --> 3:28:17.540]  you don't you know to stop a sunburn you don't drink
[3:28:17.540 --> 3:28:20.580]  sunscreen is the analogy i've seen people put out
[3:28:20.580 --> 3:28:24.500]  so why are they force medicating us and now proposing lithium
[3:28:24.500 --> 3:28:27.940]  and prozac in our water to make us stop killing each other
[3:28:27.940 --> 3:28:32.100]  if it would just stop one murder or if it would stop one assault
[3:28:32.100 --> 3:28:35.540]  shouldn't we all just be drugged it's a kindler
[3:28:35.540 --> 3:28:38.900]  gentler place but taken to north american union
[3:28:38.900 --> 3:28:42.420]  think of all the headlines you've seen in your canadian news about the olympics

[3:28:59.460 --> 3:29:02.420]  seen there's like three quarters of the classroom really knew what was going on

[3:33:47.860 --> 3:33:50.820]  ordering him to not criticize herman von rumpi
[3:33:50.820 --> 3:33:55.140]  violating his free speech herman von rumpi is unelected the bureaucrats put
[3:33:55.140 --> 3:33:59.220]  him in as the head of the eu but then the elected parliament from the nations
[3:33:59.220 --> 3:34:04.980]  has no authority or power and england never voted to be under this
[3:34:04.980 --> 3:34:08.500]  they're just expanding it in every country that gets to vote on it like
[3:34:08.500 --> 3:34:11.860]  france votes to get out but then the bureaucrats won't let him get out
[3:34:11.860 --> 3:34:16.180]  so that is coming up amongst some other important news
[3:34:16.180 --> 3:34:19.540]  right now let's go ahead and talk to roger and georgia roger you're on the
[3:34:19.540 --> 3:34:21.060]  air
[3:34:21.060 --> 3:34:24.580]  hey alex i just wanted to call and thank you for always being spot on i really
[3:34:24.580 --> 3:34:27.540]  enjoyed your interview with shooter jennings didn't realize he was well in
[3:34:27.540 --> 3:34:30.740]  sun um the reason that i'm calling is um i just
[3:34:30.740 --> 3:34:33.540]  wanted to tell you about our local newspaper here the cherokee ledger news
[3:34:33.540 --> 3:34:36.180]  you know rather than talking about the fact that teachers are
[3:34:36.180 --> 3:34:40.340]  getting pay cuts of five percent next year furloughed in economies terrible
[3:34:40.340 --> 3:34:43.300]  they're excited to let everybody know that the forces with our police
[3:34:43.300 --> 3:34:46.660]  department we're getting a new bear cat armored vehicles
[3:34:46.660 --> 3:34:50.500]  um and they're going to be sent out of all domestic violence calls 90 percent
[3:34:50.500 --> 3:34:53.300]  of police calls and these uh nice vehicles are going to have blue lights
[3:34:53.300 --> 3:34:57.780]  in them so when they come you armored armored tanks rolling around
[3:34:57.780 --> 3:35:01.060]  uh just everywhere because we're the enemy the government is building up
[3:35:01.060 --> 3:35:05.700]  to wage war against the people absolutely i don't have to take my kid to the
[3:35:05.700 --> 3:35:08.740]  debate museum or build you know toy tanks with him at home to get him to
[3:35:08.740 --> 3:35:11.860]  learn about military equipment because it's going to be in his neighborhood
[3:35:11.860 --> 3:35:15.620]  just like communist russia during the cold war
[3:35:15.620 --> 3:35:19.300]  i mean look i had by every yardstick we are becoming a
[3:35:19.300 --> 3:35:24.740]  mega tyranny go ahead absolutely um but yeah i just wanted one more comment i
[3:35:24.740 --> 3:35:27.460]  want to say again i really enjoyed you know steven kane's lead in the shooter
[3:35:27.460 --> 3:35:30.980]  jennings and i i've got a good idea for you is to put together um alex
[3:35:30.980 --> 3:35:34.260]  jones top 20 hits because i just love the the music you play during the
[3:35:34.260 --> 3:35:37.860]  interim and maybe have your little commentary with each song that you play
[3:35:37.860 --> 3:35:40.500]  and i just wanted to share that with you because i just think you're awesome
[3:35:40.500 --> 3:35:43.140]  you're doing a great thing you really woke me up about a year ago and i'm
[3:35:43.140 --> 3:35:45.780]  bringing some family members on board that would never
[3:35:45.780 --> 3:35:48.980]  believe what's going on but now that i can show them locally in the paper and
[3:35:48.980 --> 3:35:51.700]  stuff which you're talking about it it brings the uh
[3:35:51.700 --> 3:35:56.500]  the needle to the head so to speak so well sir i appreciate your call i love
[3:35:56.500 --> 3:36:00.820]  the great point you make about like we're communist russia or something
[3:36:00.820 --> 3:36:04.260]  i mean it's just in the whole world saying we're like communist russia i mean
[3:36:04.260 --> 3:36:08.900]  this is but again the black mask the tanks the
[3:36:08.900 --> 3:36:12.740]  wheeled vehicles the armored vehicles the apcs
[3:36:12.740 --> 3:36:18.580]  the la v's it is all too intimidate us if it really goes into martial law
[3:36:18.580 --> 3:36:22.580]  those things aren't going to do anything for them
[3:36:22.580 --> 3:36:27.380]  tyrants go to bars tyrants live at home tyrants are out on the street
[3:36:27.380 --> 3:36:30.580]  you know i mean they've ever gotten to a physical conflict which i don't want to
[3:36:30.580 --> 3:36:35.060]  happen their apcs will become our apcs i mean don't you
[3:36:35.060 --> 3:36:39.620]  understand you could have no weapons and take back your country
[3:36:39.620 --> 3:36:43.700]  with a baseball bat you can get all the guns you ever wanted with a baseball
[3:36:43.700 --> 3:36:49.220]  bat or a ball bean hammer or a sword you can get all the weapons all the apcs
[3:36:49.220 --> 3:36:53.620]  if you've got the will but again we want to fix it we want to reach out to police

[3:37:03.140 --> 3:37:06.820]  okay let's go to another caller let's talk to bill in north carolina bill you're
[3:37:06.820 --> 3:37:09.220]  on the air hey alex how you doing today
[3:37:09.220 --> 3:37:11.940]  good good hey alex first off i want to thank you
[3:37:11.940 --> 3:37:16.100]  for waking me up about two years ago um i want to just add on to a conversation
[3:37:16.100 --> 3:37:21.060]  that you're having brad martin on the user consumer side of the
[3:37:21.060 --> 3:37:24.900]  airsoft right after christmas after a bunch of kids in my neighborhood
[3:37:24.900 --> 3:37:29.220]  got the airsoft guns we went out to my boss's property where we have a
[3:37:29.220 --> 3:37:32.980]  building but also some wooded area and it's all paid for we own it
[3:37:32.980 --> 3:37:36.980]  and we had about seventeen kids out there with their soft rifles aging from
[3:37:36.980 --> 3:37:39.620]  probably you know four years old all the way on up and
[3:37:39.620 --> 3:37:42.660]  bunch of little tiny four-foot kids with helmets on
[3:37:42.660 --> 3:37:48.900]  and uh... within minutes we had uh... nine sheriff cars show up the corridor
[3:37:48.900 --> 3:37:51.780]  the uh... the corridor the uh... both sides of the road
[3:37:51.780 --> 3:37:54.580]  yeah well i mean hold on tell your story tell your story but
[3:37:54.580 --> 3:37:58.420]  i see in the news about every week or two
[3:37:58.420 --> 3:38:03.540]  i've had friends i have some uh... iraq war vet friends
[3:38:03.540 --> 3:38:07.940]  who were out at their own cousins farm
[3:38:07.940 --> 3:38:13.620]  in a rural area of the state and they were having an airsoft battle
[3:38:13.620 --> 3:38:18.500]  and even their neighbors called the police on them and they confiscated
[3:38:18.500 --> 3:38:22.180]  the airsoft so people aren't allowed to have fun
[3:38:22.180 --> 3:38:26.500]  because the public is so brainwashed that if they see people running around
[3:38:26.500 --> 3:38:30.580]  uh... you know shooting toy guns at each other
[3:38:30.580 --> 3:38:33.380]  so so so what happened you're on your own property
[3:38:33.380 --> 3:38:36.660]  you're out there you got people having a good time what happened
[3:38:36.660 --> 3:38:39.380]  well the first thing is uh... i i actually i was in the woods and i came
[3:38:39.380 --> 3:38:43.140]  out with woods and i'm prime military i came out with uh... my weapon down on
[3:38:43.140 --> 3:38:47.300]  the ground my hands on my head and uh... we go up to the uh... main main man
[3:38:47.300 --> 3:38:50.020]  and now we're like hey look we own this and he's like let me see the guns and
[3:38:50.020 --> 3:38:53.460]  it's like dude they're fake you know can you see the orange on them you know
[3:38:53.460 --> 3:38:56.740]  so we're you know so we we took the casing off and we showed them the the bbs
[3:38:56.740 --> 3:38:58.020]  inside of it
[3:38:58.020 --> 3:39:00.980]  after arguing with them for about fifteen minutes uh... you know if they
[3:39:00.980 --> 3:39:03.940]  finally agreed to leave but uh... wait a minute also
[3:39:03.940 --> 3:39:07.140]  so when they knew it was a plastic toy uh...
[3:39:07.140 --> 3:39:10.500]  uh... uh... uh... gun people aren't really familiar with airsoft some it's
[3:39:10.500 --> 3:39:14.980]  like paintball they you were still bad see because if they come you're bad
[3:39:14.980 --> 3:39:19.860]  you're a slave with even a toy gun that doesn't look good to a parasite
[3:39:19.860 --> 3:39:22.900]  absolutely and and and the worst part about it you know we've got all these
[3:39:22.900 --> 3:39:25.780]  scared kids there and then and uh... they said well you you kids are running
[3:39:25.780 --> 3:39:27.700]  into the other buildings holding you know
[3:39:27.700 --> 3:39:30.740]  going up to people with weapons and it's like no we're not we're sitting on our
[3:39:30.740 --> 3:39:35.220]  own private property yeah this is about this is about teaching the kids no
[3:39:35.220 --> 3:39:37.700]  you're not going to be involved in a second amendment culture
[3:39:37.700 --> 3:39:41.140]  that's why they have these drills from texas to minnesota
[3:39:41.140 --> 3:39:44.900]  from california to new york every state i've seen articles
[3:39:44.900 --> 3:39:48.900]  i put in some of my films where the police unannounced come in
[3:39:48.900 --> 3:39:53.380]  point real guns at kids heads in one case in dallas they killed cop of the year
[3:39:53.380 --> 3:39:58.100]  just so happened at one and on video and and and uh... was a detroit the cops
[3:39:58.100 --> 3:40:01.940]  shoots himself and they scream and yell i'm gonna kill you i'm a
[3:40:01.940 --> 3:40:05.780]  militia who's against public school to demonize and brainwash
[3:40:05.780 --> 3:40:09.300]  that's trauma-based mind control to demonize the second amendment
[3:40:09.300 --> 3:40:14.020]  so so after fifteen minutes i mean did the cops apologize or did they say no
[3:40:14.020 --> 3:40:17.620]  we can't wait for the day to even take your toy gun punk
[3:40:17.620 --> 3:40:21.940]  now they they they were they were they had no sense of humor they were
[3:40:21.940 --> 3:40:25.700]  severely upset and uh... you know it was it was crazy
[3:40:25.700 --> 3:40:29.060]  if i could add one more thing on two out so for everybody out there that's
[3:40:29.060 --> 3:40:32.820]  just learned about alex uh... if you uh... purchase you know it don't

[3:40:51.620 --> 3:40:55.780]  because because they need to know i understand they heard there was a big
[3:40:55.780 --> 3:40:59.620]  shootout but any idiot can pull up and hear gunshots aren't going off
[3:40:59.620 --> 3:41:03.940]  but once once it was a false alarm that's why i love open carry
[3:41:03.940 --> 3:41:07.060]  we've got to start putting our guns back in our pickup trucks
[3:41:07.060 --> 3:41:10.100]  we've got to start having them out in the open and saying no
[3:41:10.100 --> 3:41:13.780]  we're americans you're not intimidating us into destroying
[3:41:13.780 --> 3:41:16.740]  our right to even play with toy guns i appreciate your call
[3:41:16.740 --> 3:41:20.820]  see folks they're in the big lobby out there to protect toy guns so they're
[3:41:20.820 --> 3:41:24.180]  coming after the toy guns um and yeah when i get up on air
[3:41:24.180 --> 3:41:29.940]  here it is and i say that when you buy a nine ninety five
[3:41:29.940 --> 3:41:33.700]  these costs is like five dollars i think what five fifty or something

[3:42:39.300 --> 3:42:42.740]  good yeah i just want to give you heads up i was driving around this morning
[3:42:42.740 --> 3:42:47.380]  and listening to glenn beck um rant about his mormon doctrine
[3:42:47.380 --> 3:42:51.460]  and he went on and on about how we believe the constitution is inspired
[3:42:51.460 --> 3:42:55.940]  literally inspired of god right and um which i just wanted to give you guys
[3:42:55.940 --> 3:42:59.060]  a heads up it's you know it sounds innocent enough even though it's
[3:42:59.060 --> 3:43:03.220]  foolish but um you know mormon mormon eschatology
[3:43:03.220 --> 3:43:08.660]  teaches that um you know there's going to be a great mormon leader to rise up
[3:43:08.660 --> 3:43:12.500]  take control of america and form a like mormon theocracy
[3:43:12.500 --> 3:43:18.100]  of sorts well i know this i'm not an expert on mormons
[3:43:18.100 --> 3:43:21.620]  but i know that they try to approach the best and brightest when my dad you know
[3:43:21.620 --> 3:43:26.260]  had like one of the top grade averages at ut and uh
[3:43:26.260 --> 3:43:29.620]  well i just married my mother they they you know not just mormons at the door
[3:43:29.620 --> 3:43:32.180]  they sent like the high muckety mucks from austin
[3:43:32.180 --> 3:43:35.540]  you know to come say you really got to join will really help you and everything
[3:43:35.540 --> 3:43:40.260]  and i know and my dad was like no thanks i know there are a lot of mormons
[3:43:40.260 --> 3:43:44.100]  who are big supporters anti-new world order big ron paul supporters
[3:43:44.100 --> 3:43:47.460]  then you get people like oren hatch and mit romney that are republican in name
[3:43:47.460 --> 3:43:51.300]  only and i don't get into all the infighting of different you know groups
[3:43:51.300 --> 3:43:55.620]  and sex and religions uh but i do i i have read that there's this big mormon
[3:43:55.620 --> 3:43:59.140]  leader coming and i certainly hope it's not glenn becker mit romney i appreciate
[3:43:59.140 --> 3:44:03.460]  your call because the fruits of these guys is is a really really bad news
[3:44:03.460 --> 3:44:08.020]  and i would also add to that in fact i have the transcript of it
[3:44:08.020 --> 3:44:11.620]  i printed it today maybe i'll try to dig it out during the next
[3:44:11.620 --> 3:44:17.300]  break but it's video and quotes of sarah palan
[3:44:17.300 --> 3:44:21.860]  saying our constitution is being destroyed we can't let obama destroy our
[3:44:21.860 --> 3:44:25.540]  constitution we just authorized the patriot act reauthorized it
[3:44:25.540 --> 3:44:29.300]  is following everything bush did and more and she said
[3:44:29.300 --> 3:44:33.380]  yes if we give these muslim extremists a fair trial that destroys our
[3:44:33.380 --> 3:44:38.180]  constitution no that upholds it if you've got the proof they're these
[3:44:38.180 --> 3:44:41.940]  terrorists but no you've been holding collegiate mohammed for
[3:44:41.940 --> 3:44:44.900]  seven and a half years admittedly tortured his family
[3:44:44.900 --> 3:44:48.340]  he confessed to bombing buildings that weren't built till three years after he
[3:44:48.340 --> 3:44:52.660]  was incarcerated he might as well have confessed to sinking the lucetania
[3:44:52.660 --> 3:44:57.380]  or killing lincoln uh or sacri you know or crucifying jesus or
[3:44:57.380 --> 3:45:02.020]  i mean this is insane baloney
[3:45:02.020 --> 3:45:07.220]  and so they say we support the constitution by having the patriot act
[3:45:07.220 --> 3:45:11.460]  let's see the name of the patriot act is that way it's a total deception
[3:45:11.460 --> 3:45:17.300]  i'm going to go out to break with about four minutes of a nizel ferris
[3:45:17.860 --> 3:45:21.380]  m.e.p ferris apologizes to bank clerks but he didn't really do that he's
[3:45:21.380 --> 3:45:24.100]  refusing to back down uk independence party member
[3:45:24.100 --> 3:45:27.220]  european parliament nizel ferris refused to back down over comments
[3:45:27.220 --> 3:45:31.060]  he directed towards e u chief and global governance proponent herman von
[3:45:31.060 --> 3:45:35.060]  rupey he did apologize for one of the countries he called a non-state
[3:45:35.060 --> 3:45:37.860]  during a speech in front of the e u parliament last week in response to
[3:45:37.860 --> 3:45:41.300]  calls to apologize for saying herman von rupey had the
[3:45:41.300 --> 3:45:44.820]  charisma of a damp rag and the appearance of a low-grade bank clerk
[3:45:44.820 --> 3:45:49.460]  ferris announced that he would apologize but only the bank clerks the world over
[3:45:49.460 --> 3:45:53.540]  so he didn't really apologize uh as he promised to do so we
[3:45:53.540 --> 3:45:57.140]  commend him never a flip flop out of this guy
[3:45:57.140 --> 3:46:00.420]  let's go to nizel ferris video and audio and a press conference
[3:46:00.420 --> 3:46:03.620]  and then out of the break we'll try to take a few more calls and a few more
[3:46:03.620 --> 3:46:06.420]  news stories stay with us
[3:46:06.420 --> 3:46:09.220]  well i've been remaining with the president of the parliament as he is
[3:46:09.220 --> 3:46:12.660]  what's described generally as an interview about our thing
[3:46:12.660 --> 3:46:17.620]  we had a fairly frank discussion he and i debated
[3:46:17.620 --> 3:46:22.500]  what freedom of speech means and we both agree that freedom of speech is very
[3:46:22.500 --> 3:46:24.660]  important but we have different definitions of
[3:46:24.660 --> 3:46:28.500]  what freedom of speech is why interpretation of freedom of speech
[3:46:28.500 --> 3:46:31.780]  is that the limits upon it are that you cannot
[3:46:31.780 --> 3:46:35.140]  incite violence but that it is perfectly fair
[3:46:35.140 --> 3:46:38.100]  to criticize other people and especially to do so
[3:46:38.100 --> 3:46:43.060]  in a parliament that is not president buzak's interpretation
[3:46:43.060 --> 3:46:46.980]  of a free speech and he says that i've undermined the dignity
[3:46:46.980 --> 3:46:50.340]  of the parliament i responded to that by making clear
[3:46:50.340 --> 3:46:53.300]  that even in their own charter of fundamental rights which is just
[3:46:53.300 --> 3:46:56.900]  been approved as part of the different treaty article 11 says that people
[3:46:56.900 --> 3:47:00.900]  should be able to speak freely without any institutions
[3:47:00.900 --> 3:47:05.140]  stopping them from doing so we reaffirm that the up front of it is this
[3:47:05.140 --> 3:47:09.620]  i've been asked to apologize to herman agron play
[3:47:09.620 --> 3:47:13.140]  i've been asked to apologize to the european parliament
[3:47:13.140 --> 3:47:17.540]  and i've been asked to apologize to the people of belgium
[3:47:17.540 --> 3:47:21.300]  and i've had time to have a short period of time to reflect
[3:47:21.300 --> 3:47:25.140]  and i've decided that i will make an apology
[3:47:25.140 --> 3:47:29.140]  the only people i can apologize to are bank clerks the world over
[3:47:29.140 --> 3:47:33.380]  and if i defend it then i'm very sorry indeed but i'm not to apologize
[3:47:33.380 --> 3:47:39.940]  at that point i'm not going to apologize to the people of belgium
[3:47:39.940 --> 3:47:43.700]  and as a result of that the president has said that he won't let this sort of
[3:47:43.700 --> 3:47:47.460]  thing happen again what a democratic institution this is isn't it
[3:47:47.460 --> 3:47:50.660]  he won't let it happen again and he will let me know shortly
[3:47:50.660 --> 3:47:54.180]  of what my penalty is a little bit so i am assuming
[3:47:54.180 --> 3:47:58.180]  that he will suspend me for a period of time from the parliament
[3:47:58.180 --> 3:48:01.700]  i'm assuming that we will try through the competence of presidents
[3:48:01.700 --> 3:48:04.580]  in my position as leader of the group in the parliament
[3:48:04.580 --> 3:48:08.500]  take it away and all i can say is that those of us
[3:48:08.500 --> 3:48:12.660]  that have battled against the european institutions on the basis that
[3:48:12.660 --> 3:48:16.180]  they were becoming fundamentally undemocratic have improved to be
[3:48:16.180 --> 3:48:20.740]  right i have not used unparalleled language i have not incited
[3:48:20.740 --> 3:48:24.100]  dislike or hatred i have merely expressed an opinion
[3:48:24.100 --> 3:48:27.060]  and in doing so there is now actually a debate
[3:48:27.060 --> 3:48:31.380]  about who is fervent better on the point why is he being paid more for the parliament
[3:48:31.380 --> 3:48:34.580]  and just what powers does he have and i'm not going to apologize
[3:48:34.580 --> 3:48:39.220]  for what i've said it's far from the base of right throughout the european union about this
[3:48:39.220 --> 3:48:43.540]  but you insulted him i don't think that's insulting i mean compared
[3:48:43.540 --> 3:48:47.140]  with the sort of insults that i've had in this parliament
[3:48:47.140 --> 3:48:51.620]  for the leaders of the other groups um i don't think that that the two
[3:48:51.620 --> 3:48:55.300]  and frankly you know what mr van ronboy wants to do is to take away from us our
[3:48:55.300 --> 3:48:59.060]  democracy and our rights of self-government you can't do that
[3:48:59.060 --> 3:49:04.420]  without us as elected members coming back and saying we're not very happy about it
[3:49:04.420 --> 3:49:06.420]  personally um
[3:49:09.700 --> 3:49:11.700]  i said you had the charisma
[3:49:12.500 --> 3:49:15.300]  i challenged quite anybody who listened to that speech
[3:49:18.020 --> 3:49:21.540]  how many people might agree with the sentiment you were saying
[3:49:21.540 --> 3:49:25.460]  isn't that tone when you start off by saying that it needs to be rude and that might help you
[3:49:25.460 --> 3:49:31.300]  be fantastic okay uh that audio is a little little
[3:49:31.300 --> 3:49:33.780]  bad for radio and tv but you can watch the whole
[3:49:33.780 --> 3:49:37.700]  whole press conference it gets better uh towards the end let's go ahead and

[3:57:40.900 --> 3:57:46.180]  i'm 47 years old and i have the perspective of being able to see

[3:58:13.460 --> 3:58:17.460]  policy with what those they were told to go into shopping areas and all women
[3:58:17.460 --> 3:58:21.140]  would walk out with bags and say i can't be on the street and have police dogs
[3:58:21.140 --> 3:58:24.580]  attack them or knock women off their bikes or they went to the
[3:58:24.580 --> 3:58:28.340]  university to say you can't be outside at the park and people said i can't be
[3:58:28.340 --> 3:58:32.740]  outside they want to set that precedent god bless you we need more people like
