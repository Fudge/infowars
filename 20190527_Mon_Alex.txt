[00:00.000 --> 00:10.120]  Waging War on Corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of
[00:10.120 --> 00:17.800]  the Info War.
[00:17.800 --> 00:23.840]  You had Struck and Page who were in charge of launching this investigation and they were
[00:23.840 --> 00:29.960]  saying things like, we must stop this president, we need an insurance policy against this president.
[00:29.960 --> 00:34.280]  That, in my view, when you have people that are in the highest echelons of the law enforcement
[00:34.280 --> 00:39.360]  of this nation saying things like that, that sounds an awful lot like a coup and it could
[00:39.360 --> 00:41.880]  well be treason and I think that we need to know more.
[00:41.880 --> 00:44.240]  We need to know what was Jim Comey's role in all of this.
[00:44.240 --> 00:47.440]  These people reported to him, Andy McCabe reported to him.
[00:47.440 --> 00:51.400]  What was Comey's role in that and that is what the Attorney General is going to focus
[00:51.400 --> 00:52.400]  on.
[00:52.400 --> 00:56.880]  Sir, the Constitution says treason is punishable by death.
[00:56.880 --> 00:59.200]  You've accused your adversaries of treason.
[00:59.200 --> 01:01.840]  Who specifically are you accusing of treason?
[01:01.840 --> 01:07.080]  Well, I think a number of people and I think what you look is that they have unsuccessfully
[01:07.080 --> 01:10.160]  tried to take down the wrong person.
[01:10.160 --> 01:15.200]  You look at Comey, if you look at McCabe, if you look at probably people, hot people
[01:15.200 --> 01:21.120]  higher than that, if you look at Struck, they want an insurance policy so that should she,
[01:21.120 --> 01:22.280]  for any reason, lose.
[01:22.280 --> 01:28.080]  Remember, one hundred million to one, maybe he said one hundred million to nothing.
[01:28.080 --> 01:33.800]  But should she lose, we'll have an insurance policy and we'll get this guy out of office.
[01:33.800 --> 01:36.760]  That's what they said and that's what they meant.
[01:36.760 --> 01:37.760]  That's treason.
[01:37.760 --> 01:38.760]  That's treason.
[01:38.760 --> 01:52.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this live Monday, 27th.
[01:52.240 --> 01:55.520]  Two thousand and nineteen broadcast.
[01:55.520 --> 01:58.040]  We were going to run a rebroadcast today.
[01:58.040 --> 02:00.440]  Owen Schreuer was going to host tomorrow.
[02:00.440 --> 02:06.360]  I was going to go on vacation with my family for just four to five days, but I canceled
[02:06.360 --> 02:15.080]  that on Friday morning and let the crew know that I was coming back in because so many
[02:15.080 --> 02:19.320]  incredibly historic things are happening.
[02:19.320 --> 02:26.320]  As I told you months ago, Trump is going to move with treason charges against the deep
[02:26.320 --> 02:27.320]  state.
[02:27.320 --> 02:29.000]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[02:29.000 --> 02:35.320]  We're not in that place where Republican and Democratic parties basically share power
[02:35.320 --> 02:41.840]  with each other and engage in massive corruption and destroy the nation.
[02:41.840 --> 02:43.800]  Trump is really trying to be the president.
[02:43.800 --> 02:46.920]  He's really trying to restore the Republic.
[02:46.920 --> 02:57.760]  And that's why you see the insane response that is unfolding on every single front.
[02:57.760 --> 03:00.040]  That's why you see the media out of control.
[03:00.040 --> 03:03.760]  It's why you see the chai comms running ads and spending money trying to remove Trump
[03:03.760 --> 03:04.760]  from office.
[03:04.760 --> 03:08.840]  It's why you see the EU attacking because what's happening with Trump in America is
[03:08.840 --> 03:12.400]  a lot bigger than the United States, obviously.
[03:12.400 --> 03:18.040]  Here are the headlines, European elections, Italy stunned as Salvini wins majority and
[03:18.040 --> 03:20.040]  says a new Europe is born.
[03:20.040 --> 03:25.040]  Remember, parliament's run where it takes usually three elections to remove a party
[03:25.040 --> 03:32.560]  that's dominant because they are in a parliamentary system with dozens of parties and the elections
[03:32.560 --> 03:34.440]  are staggered.
[03:34.440 --> 03:39.880]  This is the last two elections have swept the nationalist patriots, anti-globalist members
[03:39.880 --> 03:46.040]  of their Senate and members of their parliament have literally broken into Bohemian Grove
[03:46.040 --> 03:50.600]  type events, broken into Bilderberg events and been beaten up.
[03:50.600 --> 03:52.560]  That was six years ago.
[03:52.560 --> 03:57.000]  Now they are the dominant party.
[03:57.000 --> 04:01.560]  Merkel coalition in crisis talks after EU vote debacle.
[04:01.560 --> 04:03.840]  She's been holding on through seven elections.
[04:03.840 --> 04:08.000]  She's lost, but she's bought off the other parties and stayed in power.
[04:08.000 --> 04:09.840]  She's going to be gone very soon.
[04:09.840 --> 04:13.600]  Nigel Farage could suddenly be the new prime minister of England.
[04:13.600 --> 04:19.960]  They're saying, wow, all the demonization he's been under, got his first start on this broadcast.
[04:19.960 --> 04:24.000]  He said on air, info wars push UKIP over the top.
[04:24.000 --> 04:28.440]  Now he heads up the new Brexit party that is the fastest growing party in Europe.
[04:28.440 --> 04:35.560]  Le Pen demands Macron dissolve parliament after globalist is dealt humiliating defeat.
[04:35.560 --> 04:39.080]  It just continues and continues.
[04:39.080 --> 04:43.800]  The globalists are striking back with massive censorship and the EU's threatening to invade
[04:43.800 --> 04:46.560]  countries that try to pull out with an EU army.
[04:46.560 --> 04:49.240]  We're right back to where World War II started again.
[04:49.240 --> 04:52.400]  I'm Alex Jones, Owen Schroeder is also in studio.
[04:52.400 --> 04:55.920]  All Joseph Watson will report from England in T minus 25 minutes.
[04:55.920 --> 04:56.920]  Stay with us.
[04:56.920 --> 05:10.200]  We're at info wars.com and news wars.com and we're defeating the leftist tyrants.
[05:10.200 --> 05:14.800]  I got mobbed on the streets by fans, but almost all of them said, we used to love you on air.
[05:14.800 --> 05:17.800]  It was so good to see you on, you know, the iTunes or on YouTube.
[05:17.800 --> 05:18.800]  Are you coming back?
[05:18.800 --> 05:19.800]  We're at info wars.com.
[05:19.800 --> 05:20.800]  We're at news wars.com.
[05:20.800 --> 05:21.800]  Paul Watson's launched his own summit.news.
[05:21.800 --> 05:22.800]  We have our own videos.
[05:22.800 --> 05:23.800]  We have our own articles.
[05:23.800 --> 05:27.560]  We're trying to destroy us, but thanks to you and others having us on info wars is still
[05:27.560 --> 05:28.560]  chatting along.
[05:28.560 --> 05:29.560]  So we're there folks.
[05:29.560 --> 05:30.560]  Tomorrow's news today.
[05:30.560 --> 05:43.480]  info wars.com info wars.com info wars.com info wars.com I'm at info wars.com and news
[05:43.480 --> 05:44.480]  wars.com.
[05:44.480 --> 05:45.480]  There you go.
[05:45.480 --> 05:46.680]  We knew this censorship is coming forever.
[05:46.680 --> 05:50.480]  We have our own video streams, our own audio streams, and it's all free to air.
[05:50.480 --> 05:51.480]  Anybody can use it.
[05:51.480 --> 05:53.000]  We upload and do whatever you want.
[05:53.000 --> 05:55.000]  We'll go to info wars.com and news wars.com.
[05:55.000 --> 05:56.000]  That's where they find it.
[05:56.000 --> 06:17.480]  You know, there's what things go websites and you just go there.
[06:17.480 --> 06:32.000]  And there's what things go websites and you just go there.
[06:32.000 --> 06:50.080]  And there's what things go websites and you just go there.
[06:50.080 --> 06:55.640]  How have I been able for 20 years to predict everything you have now seen unfold?
[06:55.640 --> 06:59.520]  It's called studying history and studying the arrogance of the establishment.
[06:59.520 --> 07:02.360]  But there is a dark side to this.
[07:02.360 --> 07:04.520]  There's an upside down world to it.
[07:04.520 --> 07:07.880]  We'll be talking about the enemy striking back.
[07:07.880 --> 07:15.800]  But first, treason is a serious word that goes to everybody knows and I broke some major
[07:15.800 --> 07:21.200]  news here and it isn't news that had already been telegraphed by the president and others,
[07:21.200 --> 07:22.720]  but I confirmed it.
[07:22.720 --> 07:28.000]  And now it's in the news the last four days and the establishment is crapping a brick
[07:28.000 --> 07:29.200]  factory.
[07:29.200 --> 07:33.840]  Every time I talk about Trump moving against the deep state and how there are large sections
[07:33.840 --> 07:37.280]  of the government that are still loyal to the republic and how Trump needs to take
[07:37.280 --> 07:39.320]  action, how that's his only course.
[07:39.320 --> 07:45.480]  I think what is really crucially important to remember here is that you had struck and
[07:45.480 --> 07:49.040]  Page who were in charge of launching this investigation.
[07:49.040 --> 07:52.640]  And they were saying things like, we must stop this president.
[07:52.640 --> 07:55.560]  We need an insurance policy against this president.
[07:55.560 --> 07:59.680]  But in my view, when you have people that are in the highest echelons of the law enforcement
[07:59.680 --> 08:04.480]  of this nation saying things like that, that sounds an awful lot like a coup.
[08:04.480 --> 08:05.840]  And it could well be treason.
[08:05.840 --> 08:07.320]  And I think that we need to know more.
[08:07.320 --> 08:09.680]  We need to know what was Jim Comey's role in all of this.
[08:09.680 --> 08:12.880]  These people reported to him, Andy McCabe reported to him.
[08:12.880 --> 08:14.400]  What was Comey's role in that?
[08:14.400 --> 08:19.080]  The deep state, the national security system that is controlled by the deep state to a
[08:19.080 --> 08:22.280]  great extent, has been trying to block Trump's reforms.
[08:22.280 --> 08:27.120]  They've listened to my phone calls with Trump and they've also listened to the phone calls
[08:27.120 --> 08:28.920]  of other people with Trump.
[08:28.920 --> 08:33.720]  And that's why they're particularly pissed because Trump does and researches what I say
[08:33.720 --> 08:34.880]  and acts on it.
[08:34.880 --> 08:35.880]  And they've admitted that.
[08:35.880 --> 08:41.160]  This isn't about tooting my horn, but it's why you have to realize that they went so far
[08:41.160 --> 08:43.880]  as to say, you're not just banned on Facebook.
[08:43.880 --> 08:46.520]  Your name is banned, buddy.
[08:46.520 --> 08:51.520]  And they are in Atlantic Monthly on the Washington Post and New York Times just last week calling
[08:51.520 --> 08:57.200]  me a apex predator saying, I've got to be basically arrested now.
[08:57.200 --> 09:01.160]  No, no, I didn't launch any wars and kill any people.
[09:01.160 --> 09:06.760]  I don't have a criminal record, but why am I the one who must not be named?
[09:06.760 --> 09:08.960]  Because I actually do my homework.
[09:08.960 --> 09:16.040]  Anyone that knows this information does not say this on air because they will be audited.
[09:16.040 --> 09:17.440]  They will be harassed.
[09:17.440 --> 09:18.440]  They will be threatened.
[09:18.440 --> 09:24.280]  They might be physically attacked, antifa will come to their house.
[09:24.280 --> 09:35.920]  So when I went to D.C., I met with three people in media, in U.S. intelligence and in government
[09:35.920 --> 09:42.120]  who had all met with the president two days before I got there.
[09:42.120 --> 09:47.800]  And these are guys in suits and high-rise buildings in D.C., some of which are household
[09:47.800 --> 09:54.120]  names, with sweat in air-conditioned rooms, and I know why, I was sweating too, running
[09:54.120 --> 09:55.120]  down their heads.
[09:55.120 --> 09:57.120]  And they said, no, he's making the move.
[09:57.120 --> 10:01.000]  We were just in the meeting with him two days ago, you're right, it's going down.
[10:01.000 --> 10:06.320]  And they've got total proof they're working with other governments, other agencies, other
[10:06.320 --> 10:07.320]  corporations.
[10:07.320 --> 10:08.320]  It's much worse than you know.
[10:08.320 --> 10:12.720]  They actually even had a plan to assassinate the president.
[10:12.720 --> 10:17.240]  So now it's gone into Red Sirenville, okay?
[10:17.240 --> 10:20.360]  This is not a drill, this is not a game.
[10:20.360 --> 10:25.200]  And they said Trump is going to move, he's going to declassify everything within a month.
[10:25.200 --> 10:29.440]  And all hell's going to break loose, so you better dig in and get your audience ready.
[10:29.440 --> 10:35.640]  As you know, I declassified, I guess, potentially millions of pages of documents.
[10:35.640 --> 10:40.840]  I don't know what it is, I have no idea, but I want to be transparent.
[10:40.840 --> 10:43.960]  Everybody wanted me to declassify, I've done it.
[10:43.960 --> 10:49.200]  You could almost say he's the trustee, he's a highly respected man.
[10:49.200 --> 10:52.880]  Our attorney general is in charge, let's see what he finds.
[10:52.880 --> 11:01.760]  But we have documents now that I have declassified for the purpose of the attorney general.
[11:01.760 --> 11:06.120]  He can then show them to the public, do whatever he wants to do with them.
[11:06.120 --> 11:12.320]  But you have to get down to what happened, because what happened is a tremendous blight
[11:12.320 --> 11:13.560]  on our country.
[11:13.560 --> 11:19.720]  What happened, the investigation, they tried to do a takedown, and you can't do that.
[11:19.720 --> 11:25.760]  And let me just tell you, this should never, ever happen to another president again.
[11:25.760 --> 11:28.960]  What he's been saying has been an attempted coup, it's got to be dealt with, but that
[11:28.960 --> 11:33.240]  is basically treason, and we've got to bring the people to justice that did it.
[11:33.240 --> 11:42.400]  Trump then signed an executive memorandum ordering all 17 U.S. intelligence agencies
[11:42.400 --> 11:46.920]  to prepare for him in the next seven days, and of course they're going to try to block
[11:46.920 --> 11:53.760]  it, but he's given the order, all declassification of all the Russia investigation, everything.
[11:53.760 --> 12:00.000]  That is pulling the trigger on the shot heard around the world.
[12:00.000 --> 12:07.120]  May 27th, 2019, we're live, because during emergency situations for the republic and
[12:07.120 --> 12:10.040]  the planet, we'll be live.
[12:10.040 --> 12:18.480]  Big news is unfolding, we'll be live on holidays, deadly or explosive or war news or economic
[12:18.480 --> 12:19.480]  news breaks.
[12:19.480 --> 12:25.480]  It's critical, I'll be on it midnight, tune in to m4wars.com and newswars.com, the globalists
[12:25.480 --> 12:29.160]  have been fighting to take us off air ahead of big events they've got planned, but now
[12:29.160 --> 12:33.480]  Trump and people in the establishment who understand that the rest of the establishment
[12:33.480 --> 12:39.680]  is insane, like Hitler, are making their move on the globalist, and you're seeing globalists
[12:39.680 --> 12:45.400]  being removed in South America, in Central America, in Africa, in Western Europe, in
[12:45.400 --> 12:55.400]  Eastern Europe, in the Middle East, in Central Asia, in Southeast Asia, in Japan, everywhere,
[12:55.400 --> 12:58.560]  humanities making its move.
[12:58.560 --> 13:03.920]  Total victory, ladies and gentlemen, in my view, the media tries to spin the Green Party
[13:03.920 --> 13:07.680]  getting some gains, because the left's getting more hardcore left, the right's getting more
[13:07.680 --> 13:14.960]  hardcore right, but massive gains, the most gains in Europe and the UK by nationalist
[13:14.960 --> 13:18.760]  populist parties, we're going to be getting into all of it today, but the President talking
[13:18.760 --> 13:24.200]  about the treason word, we told you it was coming, this is not business as usual, you
[13:24.200 --> 13:28.960]  see the establishment going after Trump, going after the press, going after us, for the last
[13:28.960 --> 13:34.760]  40 years or so you've had the Republicans and Democrats share power as they screw this,
[13:34.760 --> 13:39.120]  there's a real fight to change that and stop that, I cannot stress enough what a historic
[13:39.120 --> 13:43.760]  time this is, let's play a clip of the President, again, right before he took off to Japan,
[13:43.760 --> 13:45.760]  using the treason word, here it is.
[13:45.760 --> 13:51.680]  Sir, the Constitution says treason is punishable by death, you've accused your adversaries
[13:51.680 --> 13:55.320]  of treason, who specifically are you accusing of treason?
[13:55.320 --> 14:00.640]  Well, I think a number of people, and I think what you look is that they have unsuccessfully
[14:00.640 --> 14:06.920]  tried to take down the wrong person, if you look at Comey, if you look at McCabe, if you
[14:06.920 --> 14:12.440]  look at probably people higher than that, if you look at Struck, they want an insurance
[14:12.440 --> 14:19.000]  policy so that should she, for any reason lose, remember, 100 million to one, maybe
[14:19.000 --> 14:24.920]  he said 100 million to nothing, but should she lose, we'll have an insurance policy and
[14:24.920 --> 14:30.240]  we'll get this guy out of office, and that's what they said and that's what they meant,
[14:30.240 --> 14:31.240]  that's treason.
[14:31.240 --> 14:37.640]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, it is treason, Owen Schreuer is riding shotgun with me today,
[14:37.640 --> 14:41.680]  he'll be hosting the regular Alex Jones show tomorrow, I'll be popping in as well, but
[14:41.680 --> 14:46.520]  we had to come in on Memorial Day, because such history is unfolding, one minute to break,
[14:46.520 --> 14:51.080]  but how would you crystallize, Owen, as you ride shotgun today, where we are, I'm really
[14:51.080 --> 14:56.720]  having trouble finding words that properly lay out just how serious the situation is.
[14:56.720 --> 15:01.120]  Well, I crystallize it with a question, Alex, I mean, we've got a group of individuals that
[15:01.120 --> 15:05.240]  have committed open treason, this is not a debate, now, are these people committing
[15:05.240 --> 15:08.920]  open treason because they simply don't like one man getting elected for president, because
[15:08.920 --> 15:12.560]  they simply don't like a country's decision of who they should elect, whereas there's
[15:12.560 --> 15:17.040]  something even bigger at stake here, Alex, now, that's what I would put my money on,
[15:17.040 --> 15:20.200]  now, you heard Trump say it even goes higher up, we know who he's talking about, he's talking
[15:20.200 --> 15:24.440]  about Obama, he's talking about Brennan, he's talking about Clapper, now, they're blaming
[15:24.440 --> 15:28.280]  one another right now, who started the Russia thing, so the real question Americans are
[15:28.280 --> 15:32.920]  going to have to ask, I think, in the next coming weeks, why, why would they be committing
[15:32.920 --> 15:38.240]  open treason, why, what is so bad about America deciding its own fate, what is so bad about
[15:38.240 --> 15:42.880]  Donald Trump that they had to commit open treason to keep him out of office, and I don't
[15:42.880 --> 15:46.520]  know if the country's going to be ready to see how bad it really was, Alex, but Trump
[15:46.520 --> 15:49.720]  might not fully show him, so that's what we're going to find out.
[15:49.720 --> 15:53.480]  We'll have exactly, and how will they strike back, you just said it, what are they hiding,
[15:53.480 --> 15:59.520]  and how will they strike back, and how will we fight back, stay with us, we're live.

[20:03.840 --> 20:30.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:30.800 --> 20:47.240]  Alex Jones here back live, Alex Jones type individuals have just carried out in Europe
[20:47.240 --> 20:52.600]  and I don't say that to Brad, I'm going to say something very slowly and very clearly
[20:52.600 --> 20:57.000]  so that it sinks in for me and it sinks in for all of you out there.
[20:57.000 --> 21:00.760]  I don't take myself that seriously in poor wars.
[21:00.760 --> 21:06.000]  I mean I know we tell the truth, I do take the truth seriously but I don't put myself
[21:06.000 --> 21:11.280]  on a pedestal or think of how powerful we are because we're humble individuals.
[21:11.280 --> 21:15.480]  I respect the power of the people but I want to explain something.
[21:15.480 --> 21:22.760]  The New York Times, the Washington Post, the leftist arms of the CIA, federal judges, the
[21:22.760 --> 21:31.840]  EU, the UN, the Financial Times of London, they know that info wars rebooted nationalism
[21:31.840 --> 21:34.040]  worldwide.
[21:34.040 --> 21:39.560]  Nigel Farage, last time he was on and the time before that and when I had dinner with
[21:39.560 --> 21:47.440]  him at the RNC three years ago said half of the support for UKIP in its early days was
[21:47.440 --> 21:52.480]  info wars when they had no media and that that's how they got half their votes and how
[21:52.480 --> 21:56.360]  their party was able to grow.
[21:56.360 --> 22:02.000]  No one was running a multimedia operation covering globalism and the alternative, new
[22:02.000 --> 22:07.880]  Renaissance nationalism, free market, common sense systems.
[22:07.880 --> 22:14.120]  We did it and we told you first about the illegal spying and we told you first about
[22:14.120 --> 22:17.960]  the globalist plan and I know you know about it as well, a lot of Americans know about
[22:17.960 --> 22:18.960]  it.
[22:18.960 --> 22:22.000]  We were just the focal point.
[22:22.000 --> 22:25.720]  So it wasn't just a few people at gun shows with their tables, you know, selling G. Edward
[22:25.720 --> 22:28.200]  Griffin books which are the best people ever.
[22:28.200 --> 22:30.480]  We stand on their shoulders.
[22:30.480 --> 22:35.280]  People like Gary Allen and none dare call it conspiracy but the reason I point out the
[22:35.280 --> 22:42.080]  importance of info wars is the globalist know that we're ground zero.
[22:42.080 --> 22:43.680]  They know we're patient zero.
[22:43.680 --> 22:50.600]  They know we're domino number one baby and you've got them losing on every front and
[22:50.600 --> 22:52.200]  they've committed so many crimes.
[22:52.200 --> 22:55.920]  We'll talk about that next segment with what Owen brought up.
[22:55.920 --> 23:00.920]  They've engaged in so much criminal activity, so much eugenics, secret testing, suppressed
[23:00.920 --> 23:05.360]  technology that Trump's saying he's going to start releasing which he's begun and that's
[23:05.360 --> 23:08.920]  why they're so frantic to ignore his orders and not do what he says.
[23:08.920 --> 23:15.160]  But as they lose ground in every other country and as every election brings us closer to
[23:15.160 --> 23:22.240]  patriot nationalist dominance globally, they're done unless they can start some big wars,
[23:22.240 --> 23:26.120]  release some bio weapons or pull some other big shenanigans and believe me, they didn't
[23:26.120 --> 23:31.480]  get in power by being tame or being the shrinking violets or not being bold.
[23:31.480 --> 23:33.180]  Fortune favors the bold.
[23:33.180 --> 23:36.560]  Their fortune is power and control over human destiny.
[23:36.560 --> 23:42.000]  Our fortune is a future for our children together in God's plan to the stars and beyond.
[23:42.000 --> 23:43.000]  A pro human future.
[23:43.000 --> 23:47.680]  So I'm going to say this now, so I rarely in the early in the show really explain to
[23:47.680 --> 23:52.640]  listeners this isn't a game and I've asked for your help over the years and if it wasn't
[23:52.640 --> 23:56.360]  for you, we wouldn't be here and we have withstood the storm together.
[23:56.360 --> 24:01.080]  But we are finally going to launch more shows or we are hiring more reporters with just the
[24:01.080 --> 24:05.360]  belief and the faith that the money will come in to expand in the face of the globalist
[24:05.360 --> 24:10.120]  because they want us shut down ahead of 2020 and that's only six months away.
[24:10.120 --> 24:11.680]  Can you believe it?
[24:11.680 --> 24:15.920]  The year 2020 is only six and a half months away.
[24:15.920 --> 24:19.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are in the eye of the storm right now.
[24:19.440 --> 24:24.320]  When we come out of the eye, it is going to be 200 mile an hour winds for everybody.
[24:24.320 --> 24:30.560]  CNN's collapsing shutting down all the other leptist publications, Huffington Post, you
[24:30.560 --> 24:33.800]  name it, they're all circling the toilet bowl.
[24:33.800 --> 24:35.240]  They all lose money.
[24:35.240 --> 24:39.960]  Vice has lost $5 billion for Disney.
[24:39.960 --> 24:47.400]  $5 billion shoveling videos of how the dictator of China is good and Trump is bad shoveling
[24:47.400 --> 24:53.800]  videos how I'm evil and Trump's evil and how Christians suck and how Jesus sucks.
[24:53.800 --> 25:00.880]  They're rejected billions into vice and they can't even stand up to info wars.
[25:00.880 --> 25:07.920]  They don't have the footprint or the result because people know lies when they see it.
[25:07.920 --> 25:11.640]  We don't have $5 billion the last five years.
[25:11.640 --> 25:19.040]  We spent over $150 million the last five years to run this place.
[25:19.040 --> 25:22.960]  That's how much the bandwidth and the insurance and the crew and the legal and the systems
[25:22.960 --> 25:28.840]  and the taxes and the regulations in media, little bitty radio stations cost millions
[25:28.840 --> 25:30.440]  to run a year.
[25:30.440 --> 25:32.920]  Newspapers in middle sized towns cost millions.
[25:32.920 --> 25:36.480]  Newspapers in big towns cost $100 million to run.
[25:36.480 --> 25:42.760]  It costs $450 million a year to run BuzzFeed and they've got to get over $100 million from
[25:42.760 --> 25:46.120]  Soros and they still lose money.
[25:46.120 --> 25:47.920]  We don't get anything from Soros.
[25:47.920 --> 25:53.800]  We don't get anything from anybody but you and we need $40 million a year to run this
[25:53.800 --> 25:58.080]  place and defeat the globalist and pay for the bandwidth and pay for the audio and pay
[25:58.080 --> 25:59.760]  for the crew and do it.
[25:59.760 --> 26:01.280]  Sounds like a lot in media.
[26:01.280 --> 26:02.280]  It's not.
[26:02.280 --> 26:04.720]  It's truly David versus Goliath.
[26:04.720 --> 26:08.280]  The New York Times cost $500 million a year to run.
[26:08.280 --> 26:12.480]  They're losing money owned by kingpins and drug dealers and a coalition of the Legion
[26:12.480 --> 26:14.280]  of Doom.
[26:14.280 --> 26:19.680]  We're funded by you and so for the hardcore audience that's tuned in on Memorial Day,
[26:19.680 --> 26:24.600]  you've seen the fruits, you've seen our steadfastness, you've seen our commitment to the republic,
[26:24.600 --> 26:28.640]  our commitment to the free market, our commitment to religious freedom, our commitment to the
[26:28.640 --> 26:35.040]  west and our commitment to not back down and it's that spirit of not backing down the enemy
[26:35.040 --> 26:36.040]  hates.
[26:36.040 --> 26:38.520]  But I need viewers and listeners to understand something.
[26:38.520 --> 26:40.200]  This is the big fight.
[26:40.200 --> 26:44.320]  All the other idols leading up to this were important but we're entering in the next few
[26:44.320 --> 26:53.640]  years, the next four years, the climaxes and battles and grand finales and wars and firebombings
[26:53.640 --> 27:01.160]  and mass shootings and false flags and all hell is about to break loose.
[27:01.160 --> 27:06.440]  Now we are peaceful when it comes to offense but we'll defend ourselves when it comes to
[27:06.440 --> 27:07.440]  defense.
[27:07.440 --> 27:13.720]  But I'm telling everybody, get ready, get geared up and do whatever you can now to reach
[27:13.720 --> 27:19.720]  out to people, to warn people and to spread the word about broadcasts that are telling
[27:19.720 --> 27:26.760]  the truth and I encourage you to start your own newsletter, start your own local newspaper.
[27:26.760 --> 27:30.880]  As the censorship intensifies, old fashioned radios can be more important than ever.
[27:30.880 --> 27:35.560]  As the censorship intensifies, local little newspapers you hand out yourself will be more
[27:35.560 --> 27:38.520]  precious than ever.
[27:38.520 --> 27:47.920]  As we go into this fight, we are shaping the future of the world and our destinies and
[27:47.920 --> 27:52.760]  everything together.

[28:21.440 --> 28:26.600]  having huge victories but the enemy is fighting for its life right now and the enemy is pouring
[28:26.600 --> 28:30.920]  billions a month into their fake news and into their life as garbage and it's not working
[28:30.920 --> 28:35.240]  so they're pumping even more in and while they sue us and harass us and lie about us
[28:35.240 --> 28:41.720]  and boycott us and sabotage us so we won't be on the field when they roll out their final
[28:41.720 --> 28:42.720]  operations.
[28:42.720 --> 28:45.840]  Well, we're going to be on the field thanks to your support but everybody should go get

[29:04.800 --> 29:10.320]  may not be fully detected by you but the symptoms are there, loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes

[30:05.240 --> 30:06.240]  You are the man, Alex.

[30:08.240 --> 30:09.240]  I'm such a big fan.

[30:11.960 --> 30:14.560]  I gotta do a shout out for the bone broth.
[30:14.560 --> 30:15.560]  The bone broth.
[30:15.560 --> 30:16.560]  The bone broth.

[30:18.560 --> 30:19.560]  The bone broth.
[30:19.560 --> 30:20.560]  The bone broth.
[30:20.560 --> 30:24.560]  Taste like, taste like, great milkshake, you know, if you just add it to milk.
[30:24.560 --> 30:25.560]  It tastes like oval cream.
[30:25.560 --> 30:26.560]  It tastes like oval cream.
[30:26.560 --> 30:27.560]  It tastes like oval cream.
[30:27.560 --> 30:28.560]  Like good.
[30:28.560 --> 30:29.560]  I feel great since I've been taking it.
[30:29.560 --> 30:30.560]  I feel great since I've been taking it.
[30:30.560 --> 30:32.560]  I feel great since I've been taking it.
[30:32.560 --> 30:37.000]  My daughter uses the bubblegum fluoride-free toothpaste.
[30:37.000 --> 30:41.600]  I've used the SuperMail Vitality, a host of other products, so thank you so much for
[30:41.600 --> 30:42.600]  that as well.
[30:42.600 --> 30:45.120]  Brother, you're thanking me for buying the products and keeping us on air.
[30:45.120 --> 30:46.120]  I'm thanking you.
[30:46.120 --> 30:50.840]  But yes, this is the ultimate bone broth formula with the turmeric, the chocolate mushroom,
[30:50.840 --> 30:51.840]  the true bone broth.
[30:51.840 --> 30:52.840]  It is next level.
[30:52.840 --> 30:53.840]  It really is good.
[30:53.840 --> 30:54.840]  So thank you.
[30:54.840 --> 30:56.400]  I feel great since I've been taking it.
[30:56.400 --> 31:00.400]  Thank you.
[31:00.400 --> 31:04.920]  Everybody knows that supplements are amazing, that what God gave us for Mother Nature is
[31:04.920 --> 31:05.920]  incredible.
[31:05.920 --> 31:09.040]  That's why supplements are the biggest growing industry in the world, and the globalists
[31:09.040 --> 31:10.520]  are so upset.
[31:10.520 --> 31:16.200]  The problem is, people forget to take them, and that's why the whole industry has moved
[31:16.200 --> 31:19.680]  towards packets that you take in the morning and you take at night.

[33:22.440 --> 33:30.560]  You're listening to an infowors.com front line report, it's Alex Jones.
[33:30.560 --> 33:36.560]  And Owen Shroyer riding shotgun live on this Memorial Day special victory edition, and
[33:36.560 --> 33:40.880]  joining us for the next 45 minutes or so, Paul Joseph Watson from London, England.
[33:40.880 --> 33:47.040]  He's been at parliament covering UKIP, covering the Brexit movement, covering Nigel Farage.
[33:47.040 --> 33:50.000]  It's an incredible time, ladies and gentlemen.
[33:50.000 --> 33:57.240]  Le Pen beats Macron in France as nationalists gain in EU vote.
[33:57.240 --> 34:03.680]  European elections, Italy stunned as Salvini wins majority and says a new Europe is born.
[34:03.680 --> 34:07.320]  Again, these are parliamentary elections, which takes two or three rounds, two or three
[34:07.320 --> 34:11.160]  elections to ever remove an establishment party.
[34:11.160 --> 34:14.720]  He just won in the second round.
[34:14.720 --> 34:19.800]  Merkel has lost six rounds, and through fraud and over 20 parties in Germany, she stayed
[34:19.800 --> 34:24.000]  in by making deals with the other coalitions.
[34:24.000 --> 34:26.600]  But now her party's getting less than 10% of the vote.
[34:26.600 --> 34:28.760]  She's going to have to step down.
[34:28.760 --> 34:33.640]  European elections, Italy stunned a Salvini wins majority and says a new Europe is born.
[34:33.640 --> 34:41.560]  Merkel's coalition in crisis talks after EU vote debacle, ladies and gentlemen.
[34:41.560 --> 34:46.520]  Could Nigel Farage become the prime minister with the new Brexit party only six and a half
[34:46.520 --> 34:51.040]  weeks old, the most powerful, fast-growing party in Europe?
[34:51.040 --> 34:56.680]  Le Pen demands Macron dissolve parliament after globalist is dealt humiliating defeat.
[34:56.680 --> 35:03.400]  Paul Joseph Watson, infowars.com, story right now.
[35:03.400 --> 35:05.080]  Here's my questions for Paul.
[35:05.080 --> 35:06.080]  We'll go to him in a moment.
[35:06.080 --> 35:08.680]  Who's the expert on this over in the UK?
[35:08.680 --> 35:11.520]  But you, Owen, you made the point earlier.
[35:11.520 --> 35:14.360]  How is the deep state globally that ties itself together?
[35:14.360 --> 35:19.320]  As Trump has said, the EU, Australia, the UK caught illegally spying on him at the behest
[35:19.320 --> 35:20.320]  of Obama.
[35:20.320 --> 35:21.320]  Trump's the president.
[35:21.320 --> 35:22.960]  He has all that classified info.
[35:22.960 --> 35:28.040]  He's saying declassify it all, showing the total illegality, it'll be an international
[35:28.040 --> 35:31.680]  scandal, the likes of which we've never seen.
[35:31.680 --> 35:33.360]  How big will that be?
[35:33.360 --> 35:36.360]  How are they going to counter strike against this?
[35:36.360 --> 35:37.840]  What is their response?
[35:37.840 --> 35:39.000]  Do you think it's going to be?
[35:39.000 --> 35:42.520]  How will the global empire ally with the Chai Comm strike back?
[35:42.520 --> 35:48.920]  Well, I think if you take the paradigm of globalism in Europe, and then that coming
[35:48.920 --> 35:51.240]  to the West, that was the whole goal.
[35:51.240 --> 35:55.040]  You started in Europe, you test run it there, and then you bring it out in the West.
[35:55.040 --> 35:59.440]  Well, they had what they wanted going on with the EU and all the momentum.
[35:59.440 --> 36:00.680]  But then what happened?
[36:00.680 --> 36:02.760]  In the West, Trump got elected.
[36:02.760 --> 36:07.400]  So kind of like globalism was the test case in Europe to go to the West.
[36:07.400 --> 36:13.280]  And it's almost like nationalism was the test case, of course, by organically, by the citizens
[36:13.280 --> 36:15.800]  of the United States of America.
[36:15.800 --> 36:19.400]  Nationalism was the test case in the West to then bring to Europe.
[36:19.400 --> 36:24.800]  So it seems like how we were kind of behind with all the leftist trendy garbage from
[36:24.800 --> 36:26.740]  Europe catching up to here in the West.
[36:26.740 --> 36:30.400]  Now they're starting to catch up to all the nationalism that we started when we elected
[36:30.400 --> 36:31.400]  Trump.
[36:31.400 --> 36:32.400]  Trump's launching all these investigations.
[36:32.400 --> 36:33.400]  He's talking about treason.
[36:33.400 --> 36:37.240]  Well, I think you're going to start seeing some of that go on once some of these nationalists
[36:37.240 --> 36:38.240]  get into power.
[36:38.240 --> 36:42.080]  But you see these headlines, Alex, European elections, Italy's stunned as Salvini wins
[36:42.080 --> 36:43.720]  majority and says a new Europe is born.
[36:43.720 --> 36:45.600]  What does that remind you of?
[36:45.600 --> 36:50.480]  2016, when Trump won and they said, stunned, nobody saw it coming.
[36:50.480 --> 36:54.800]  This is the same arrogance that we saw from the left in America.
[36:54.800 --> 36:56.160]  Of course, Trump was going to win.
[36:56.160 --> 36:58.480]  He won a rigged election.
[36:58.480 --> 37:02.760]  These people are so arrogant, they think just because they say it is, it is.
[37:02.760 --> 37:07.280]  Now look at that picture of Le Pen and it really kind of puts, I think, the attitude
[37:07.280 --> 37:08.280]  into perspective.
[37:08.280 --> 37:12.140]  It's like, no, you arrogantly thought you controlled this country.
[37:12.140 --> 37:15.520]  You arrogantly thought you controlled the vote and you arrogantly thought you could
[37:15.520 --> 37:18.680]  bully people out of controlling their own fate and you lost.
[37:18.680 --> 37:19.680]  That's right.
[37:19.680 --> 37:20.680]  So how are they going to counter strike?
[37:20.680 --> 37:22.000]  I'm going to come back to you and ask you that.
[37:22.000 --> 37:25.840]  I'm going to ask Paul the latest to break it all down, how the establishment is going
[37:25.840 --> 37:26.840]  to take this.
[37:26.840 --> 37:32.080]  But speaking of arrogance, Owen, here is just five days ago, Junker, the literal Nazi era,
[37:32.080 --> 37:37.760]  the most powerful Nazi family, German royalty, the Junker dynasty, the royalty of Luxembourg.
[37:37.760 --> 37:41.360]  Here they are saying stupid people in Europe love their countries.
[37:41.360 --> 37:42.360]  They're so stupid.
[37:42.360 --> 37:44.320]  We're going to bring all the foreigners in.
[37:44.320 --> 37:45.320]  Ha, ha, ha.
[37:45.320 --> 37:48.520]  Speaking of Marie Antoinette saying, let them eat cake.
[37:48.520 --> 37:52.200]  No one knows if she really said that before they stormed the Bastille to start the French
[37:52.200 --> 37:53.200]  Revolution.
[37:53.200 --> 37:54.200]  But he did say this.
[37:54.200 --> 37:55.200]  Here it is.
[37:55.200 --> 38:03.080]  People are looking at us as if we were a kind of peace guard because we have achieved on
[38:03.080 --> 38:06.680]  this continent what has not been achieved elsewhere.
[38:06.680 --> 38:15.160]  We have 60 wars for the time being globally spoken, none in Europe apart Ukraine, which
[38:15.160 --> 38:20.160]  is part of Europe, which is not part of the European Union.
[38:20.160 --> 38:26.960]  These populist, nationalist, stupid, nationalist, they are in love with the old country and
[38:26.960 --> 38:29.600]  they don't like the others.
[38:29.600 --> 38:37.680]  In some countries of the European Union, the government, the parliament, the nationalists,
[38:37.680 --> 38:39.040]  they love their countries.
[38:39.040 --> 38:44.640]  No, they don't like you an unelected Nazi heir owning and running them and setting up
[38:44.640 --> 38:45.640]  the unelected EU.
[38:45.640 --> 38:50.520]  So you created this, this parliament, the ceremonial, but now that parliament itself is repudiating
[38:50.520 --> 38:51.520]  you.
[38:51.520 --> 38:52.880]  And the word is the EU is going to break up very soon.
[38:52.880 --> 38:59.240]  Paul Joseph Watson, the real expert on this with summit.news, also edits for info wars.com
[38:59.240 --> 39:00.600]  and news wars.com.
[39:00.600 --> 39:01.720]  This is a pretty big deal.
[39:01.720 --> 39:05.440]  How would you quantify what just unfolded in the last three days?
[39:05.440 --> 39:11.800]  Well, it's a complete repudiation of this notion, Alex, that we heard in 2017, remember
[39:11.800 --> 39:16.640]  when Macron was elected president of France, that populism was dead.
[39:16.640 --> 39:21.920]  That's what we were told in May 2017 when he was elected, that this was the end of
[39:21.920 --> 39:22.920]  the road.
[39:22.920 --> 39:25.240]  The Brexit Trump wave was over.
[39:25.240 --> 39:29.840]  Well, that's proven to be completely false in terms of what happened in France yesterday.
[39:29.840 --> 39:32.200]  But overall, it's kind of a mixed bag.
[39:32.200 --> 39:35.360]  Obviously, you've got massive success for the Brexit party.
[39:35.360 --> 39:41.780]  What they've done to the globalist credit in this Machiavellian way is they demoralized
[39:41.780 --> 39:47.720]  the voter by indoctrinating them that their vote doesn't mean anything because it's just
[39:47.720 --> 39:49.520]  going to be overridden.
[39:49.520 --> 39:56.360]  And that's why you saw in the UK specifically, first of all, lower turnout on average compared
[39:56.360 --> 40:02.320]  to other European countries and higher turnout in remain voting areas.
[40:02.320 --> 40:08.000]  So the people who voted to stay in the EU in 2016, they were more enthusiastic about
[40:08.000 --> 40:14.680]  voting in yesterday's elections because in those areas, they got out to the polls more.
[40:14.680 --> 40:19.880]  Which means, obviously, that we have had this complete political disenfranchisement of voters
[40:19.880 --> 40:26.400]  in the United Kingdom leave voters because after three years of Brexit being made deliberately
[40:26.400 --> 40:34.120]  a total mess of, being deliberately sabotaged, many of those people who voted leave in 2016
[40:34.120 --> 40:38.840]  did stay home because, again, they think that their vote has no impact whatsoever, that
[40:38.840 --> 40:40.840]  it's just going to be overridden.
[40:40.840 --> 40:47.000]  But even with that, Nigel Farage's Brexit party, which again, to remind people, started
[40:47.000 --> 40:54.840]  out of nothing six weeks ago, it was at 15% in the polls, it was at 20%, it was at 25%.
[40:54.840 --> 41:01.800]  By the end of it, it was up to 30, 35% got more votes than the two establishment parties,
[41:01.800 --> 41:05.800]  the Conservative Party and Labour Party, combined.
[41:05.800 --> 41:11.360]  So what we're seeing is not only a populist backlash, a resurgence of populism, which
[41:11.360 --> 41:17.320]  by the way is global, and I'll get onto that in a bit, but this is the complete repudiation
[41:17.320 --> 41:18.820]  of the two-party system.
[41:18.820 --> 41:25.040]  I don't think we've ever seen anything like this in Europe, at least, for generations,
[41:25.040 --> 41:26.040]  Alex.
[41:26.040 --> 41:30.440]  So we have a situation now whereby, obviously, Theresa May, the Prime Minister, resigned or
[41:30.440 --> 41:35.160]  said she would resign on Friday, she's going to step down at the start of next month.
[41:35.160 --> 41:39.920]  We've got a Tory leadership contest coming up, where they're going to squabble between
[41:39.920 --> 41:44.120]  who's going to lead the Tory party and obviously, by extension, the country.
[41:44.120 --> 41:49.160]  Now Nigel Farage has created this massive pressure group to the point where he's now
[41:49.160 --> 41:54.880]  demanding an in on the negotiations with the EU, with his Brexit party.
[41:54.880 --> 42:01.560]  But obviously now, if the Conservative Party does not deliver Brexit before October 31,
[42:01.560 --> 42:06.720]  which is their new deadline, six months after they said it would be done on March 31, they
[42:06.720 --> 42:12.160]  are going to get completely crushed in the next general election because Farage will
[42:12.160 --> 42:17.320]  run with his Brexit party in the national elections and he will take away that vote,
[42:17.320 --> 42:20.560]  which will ensure the Conservative Party won't be returned to power.
[42:20.560 --> 42:23.360]  So that is the pressure gauge that's now being put on them.
[42:23.360 --> 42:25.000]  That's what he promised to do.
[42:25.000 --> 42:26.240]  No more Mr. Nice Guy.
[42:26.240 --> 42:32.080]  Now, if they don't deliver Brexit before October 31, their political future in Westminster
[42:32.080 --> 42:33.240]  is completely finished.
[42:33.240 --> 42:35.280]  So that's what this has achieved.
[42:35.280 --> 42:37.280]  Bottom line, get your popcorn out, folks.
[42:37.280 --> 42:40.120]  This is going to be wild and it's going to be dangerous.
[42:40.120 --> 42:41.600]  And by the way, you're not a spectator.
[42:41.600 --> 42:42.600]  You're in the arena.
[42:42.600 --> 42:44.600]  What's happening in Europe totally affects us.
[42:44.600 --> 42:46.160]  This is globalism on its heels.
[42:46.160 --> 42:48.160]  But as Paul said, they're running the scythe.
[42:48.160 --> 42:49.680]  Your vote doesn't count.
[42:49.680 --> 42:51.680]  Remember three years ago?
[42:51.680 --> 42:53.680]  Where it was Brexit actually brought Trump in.
[42:53.680 --> 42:54.680]  Remember what I said?
[42:54.680 --> 42:55.680]  I'll repeat it when we come back.
[42:55.680 --> 42:56.680]  It's critical.
[42:56.680 --> 42:57.680]  It's key.
[42:57.680 --> 42:58.680]  They've not shut down our speech.
[42:58.680 --> 42:59.680]  We're at infowars.com and newswars.com.
[42:59.680 --> 43:00.680]  And we're defeating the leftist tyrants.
[43:00.680 --> 43:01.680]  I got mobbed on the streets by fans.
[43:01.680 --> 43:02.680]  But almost all of them said, we used to love you on air.
[43:02.680 --> 43:03.680]  It was so good to see you on, you know, the iTunes or on YouTube.
[43:03.680 --> 43:04.680]  Are you coming back?
[43:04.680 --> 43:05.680]  We're at infowars.com.
[43:05.680 --> 43:06.680]  We're at newswars.com.
[43:06.680 --> 43:07.680]  Paul Watts has launched his own summit.news.
[43:07.680 --> 43:08.680]  We have our own videos.
[43:08.680 --> 43:09.680]  We're at infowars.com.
[43:09.680 --> 43:10.680]  We're at newswars.com.
[43:10.680 --> 43:11.680]  We're at newswars.com.
[43:11.680 --> 43:21.680]  Paul Watts has launched his own summit.news.
[43:21.680 --> 43:22.680]  We have our own videos.
[43:22.680 --> 43:23.680]  We have our own articles.
[43:23.680 --> 43:24.680]  They're trying to destroy us.
[43:24.680 --> 43:27.680]  But thanks to you and others having us on, infowars is still checking along.
[43:27.680 --> 43:28.680]  So we're there, folks.
[43:28.680 --> 43:29.680]  Tomorrow's news.
[43:29.680 --> 43:41.680]  We're at infowars.com.
[43:41.680 --> 43:42.680]  I'm at infowars.com and newswars.com.
[43:42.680 --> 43:43.680]  There you go.
[43:43.680 --> 43:45.680]  We knew this censorship was coming forever.
[43:45.680 --> 43:49.680]  We have our own video streams, our own audio streams, and it's all free to air.
[43:49.680 --> 43:50.680]  Anybody can use it.
[43:50.680 --> 43:51.680]  Reupload it.
[43:51.680 --> 43:52.680]  Do whatever you want.
[43:52.680 --> 43:53.680]  People go to infowars.com and newswars.com.
[43:53.680 --> 43:54.680]  That's where they find it.
[43:54.680 --> 44:01.680]  You know, there's what things go to websites and you just go there.
[44:01.680 --> 44:06.680]  It would take me more than an hour just to lay out all the admitted benefits and known
[44:06.680 --> 44:11.680]  positive effects of just one of the ingredients in our ultimate bone broth formula.
[44:11.680 --> 44:16.680]  Everybody knows about bone broth itself and all of the amazing things that it's associated
[44:16.680 --> 44:17.680]  with.
[44:17.680 --> 44:19.680]  And then it's been the big craze for at least a decade.
[44:19.680 --> 44:23.680]  Well, thousands of years ago, it's what everybody told people they should drink in a soup if
[44:23.680 --> 44:24.680]  they're sick.
[44:24.680 --> 44:28.280]  But then you add, not just the fact that this is the strongest, most concentrated, highest
[44:28.280 --> 44:33.440]  quality bone broth out there, literally, then you have the chaga mushroom, then you have
[44:33.440 --> 44:37.600]  the turmeric, then you have the bee pollen, then you have the other key ingredients that
[44:37.600 --> 44:42.680]  are all known to just make people incredibly strong and healthy.
[44:42.680 --> 44:44.880]  Our ultimate bone broth formula is amazing.
[44:44.880 --> 44:49.800]  It's 50% off right now at infowars.com because I want you to try and see how great it is.
[44:49.800 --> 44:52.640]  And of course, getting the bone broth isn't just great for you and your family.
[44:52.640 --> 44:57.240]  It's also amazing when it comes to funding our operation that's taken on the globalists
[44:57.240 --> 45:01.320]  and fighting for all of our freedoms.
[45:01.320 --> 45:06.320]  I want to salute and commend every man, woman, and child that has supported this broadcast
[45:06.320 --> 45:08.320]  over the years and that has stood with us.
[45:08.320 --> 45:11.320]  And I want to thank all of our sponsors and all of our affiliates.
[45:11.320 --> 45:15.720]  And I'll tell you like it is, you've seen the unmitigated attack we've been under.
[45:15.720 --> 45:17.720]  You're our only sponsors.
[45:17.720 --> 45:21.760]  And when you don't buy the products, they're absolutely the best out there.
[45:21.760 --> 45:24.120]  We aren't able to continue on.
[45:24.120 --> 45:26.480]  So remember, you are the InfoWars.
[45:26.480 --> 45:27.640]  I'm not the leader.
[45:27.640 --> 45:28.640]  You are the leader.
[45:28.640 --> 45:30.440]  When you take action, nothing stops you.
[45:30.440 --> 45:35.840]  We've got giant specials running right now at infowars.com that are unprecedented.
[45:35.840 --> 45:40.680]  And if you go there and buy great products that you already need from across the board,
[45:40.680 --> 45:43.560]  it funds the second American Revolution worldwide.
[45:43.560 --> 45:49.200]  So I want to thank you for your support and I want to encourage you again to go to infowars.com
[45:49.200 --> 45:51.280]  for whatever the product is you need.
[45:51.280 --> 45:54.560]  We have thousands of them and it makes this all possible.
[45:54.560 --> 45:56.560]  Thank you for making InfoWars possible.
[45:56.560 --> 46:01.080]  God bless you.
[46:01.080 --> 46:07.840]  Recent studies and reports have shown that pipes and plumbing are getting clogged and
[46:07.840 --> 46:11.960]  backed up with human waste and debris.
[46:11.960 --> 46:16.880]  This is from people flushing things that aren't meant to be flushed like baby wipes
[46:16.880 --> 46:23.600]  and feminine products and safe sex products and so this is resulting in pipes being backed
[46:23.600 --> 46:25.560]  up and clogged.
[46:25.560 --> 46:30.240]  Well just like plumbing gets clogged and just like pipes get clogged, the human body
[46:30.240 --> 46:34.120]  gets clogged just like that and you may be experiencing back up too.
[46:34.120 --> 46:39.840]  So if you want some relief, some explosive relief, go to infowars.com and get oxy powder
[46:39.840 --> 46:43.280]  but let me warn you, this stuff is no joke.
[46:43.280 --> 46:50.640]  If you're experiencing some cloggage, some back up of your own, oxy powder from infowarsstore.com
[46:50.640 --> 46:53.720]  will clear it out guaranteed.
[46:53.720 --> 47:03.520]  So go to infowarsstore.com, take care of your clogged plumbing with oxy powder.
[47:03.520 --> 47:26.720]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:26.720 --> 47:38.680]  We are the most banned, most demonized, most lied about broadcasts for a good reason and
[47:38.680 --> 47:46.000]  I want to explain this again, I'm not up there saying, hey man I'm really smart, look, I'm
[47:46.000 --> 47:53.200]  number one in the enemy's eyes, it's because we really research, we really are engaged and
[47:53.200 --> 48:00.040]  70 years, just disinfo and pablum and dumb down garbage but along came the internet and
[48:00.040 --> 48:04.720]  the globals were so arrogant that thousands of different individuals started shows on
[48:04.720 --> 48:11.480]  the internet but I was able to get on talk radio on hundreds of stations and I was able
[48:11.480 --> 48:17.240]  to infect these Brian Stelter and the Clinton Foundation and others own words.
[48:17.240 --> 48:23.880]  I was able to infect Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh, Tucker Carlson, Laura Ingram, you tune into
[48:23.880 --> 48:29.160]  them now, they sound just like me, they're not copying what I said, they're now actually
[48:29.160 --> 48:33.320]  took the blinders off, they see exactly what I see.
[48:33.320 --> 48:37.240]  So it's not like I'm telling Trump what to say, he just sees the same damn thing.
[48:37.240 --> 48:44.720]  We're promoting Americana and freedom versus globalism and communism and corporate crony
[48:44.720 --> 48:50.680]  tyranny, fascism, should be pretty easy to sell that, right?
[48:50.680 --> 48:55.680]  I've believed in you, I bet on you and you know what, you've been coming through, I've
[48:55.680 --> 48:59.880]  been coming through, Paul Watts has been coming through and Owen's right that Trump helps
[48:59.880 --> 49:04.400]  supercharge nationalism and populism two and a half years ago worldwide but it really
[49:04.400 --> 49:11.120]  happened with Nigel Farage and Brexit and UKIP and they had their own spat, he's got
[49:11.120 --> 49:16.480]  Brexit, hey fine, more nationalist parties, more patriot parties and there's dozens of
[49:16.480 --> 49:22.520]  them in Europe that are growing fast, it's not just Brexit that's the biggest in the
[49:22.520 --> 49:28.160]  UKIP and then others, it's dozens and dozens because again some countries have up to 50
[49:28.160 --> 49:33.800]  different parties, that's one reason they want to get rid of the constitutional system
[49:33.800 --> 49:40.760]  that we have here with electoral college because then you'd have the states with more population
[49:40.760 --> 49:45.600]  enslaving those that don't have a population, the tyranny of the majority, a pure democracy,
[49:45.600 --> 49:52.480]  very dangerous and you could have 50 parties, people are always, I want more parties, I
[49:52.480 --> 49:57.600]  want more parties, I notice the left's always pushing that and sure, it's good to have some
[49:57.600 --> 50:02.240]  libertarian party or whatever but they usually just take away from the conservative party,
[50:02.240 --> 50:03.240]  don't they?
[50:03.240 --> 50:07.360]  Instead, the libertarians have taken over the republican party, we've almost completed
[50:07.360 --> 50:12.240]  the conversion so let me make the huge announcement, go back to Paul and go back to Owen, I want
[50:12.240 --> 50:19.120]  to try effective here, I'd like to give myself credit but three and a half years ago when
[50:19.120 --> 50:24.640]  Brexit passed or almost three and a half years ago but three years ago and change, financial
[50:24.640 --> 50:29.400]  times of London is an establishment paper so it communicates more than even the New
[50:29.400 --> 50:34.720]  York Times to the establishment and they said, we'll do what we've done with other countries
[50:34.720 --> 50:38.200]  that never voted to be in the EU, most of them never did, they thought it was a trade
[50:38.200 --> 50:44.920]  deal, just like TPP or other scams, they run against America and so they said, just like
[50:44.920 --> 50:48.520]  Ireland voted no to be in the EU over and over again because they demanded a vote, they finally
[50:48.520 --> 50:53.120]  did it the third time, other countries never voted to be in here, we'll just hold it up
[50:53.120 --> 51:00.120]  and they'll get demoralized so what Paul says is true but listen, they held it up, it takes
[51:00.120 --> 51:05.320]  three years to remove May, it doesn't matter, you get stronger, they get weaker.
[51:05.320 --> 51:09.520]  Three years ago most people didn't know that England never voted to join the, or Scotland
[51:09.520 --> 51:14.640]  or Ireland, Ireland did to join the EU, now people know about this and there's no putting
[51:14.640 --> 51:19.480]  it back together again and even if you still have an EU, it'll all be run by nationalists
[51:19.480 --> 51:26.000]  and patriots soon and it'll all go back to where it was which is Renaissance, not way
[51:26.000 --> 51:31.720]  back to the tyranny of the system but Paul's absolutely right, they run this Bengali of
[51:31.720 --> 51:37.320]  oh look, you didn't get what you wanted, you didn't get it within three years, you're
[51:37.320 --> 51:45.360]  demoralized and then people bought it, record low turnout by Briggs voters and record high
[51:45.360 --> 51:53.200]  turnout by the state, the minions, they still lost though overall but it's parliamentary,
[51:53.200 --> 51:57.600]  it'll take multiple elections to remove the establishment but it's already happening in
[51:57.600 --> 52:01.760]  Germany, it's already about to happen in France, it's already happening in Greece, it's already
[52:01.760 --> 52:08.160]  happening in Italy especially, so this is a long fight folks, this is a marathon, this
[52:08.160 --> 52:13.920]  is not a sprint, slow and easy wins the race, we have the moral right, we have the moral
[52:13.920 --> 52:19.280]  superiority, we have the votes of the people, we have Junker arrogantly saying oh I hate
[52:19.280 --> 52:23.360]  nationalists, so I think we went in the end but I agree with you Paul, getting the message
[52:23.360 --> 52:30.720]  out that this is a long 12 round heavyweight boxing match, not a hundred yard dash is critical
[52:30.720 --> 52:33.640]  so we don't buy the scythe, please continue.
[52:33.640 --> 52:40.160]  Well exactly Alex, I mean and to zoom out from that before we get back into the weeds,
[52:40.160 --> 52:44.240]  you know the Brexit part is the biggest party in the European Parliament now, it's bigger
[52:44.240 --> 52:51.360]  than Angela Merkel's party, worldwide we just had an election in Australia where the conservative
[52:51.360 --> 52:56.400]  populist candidate was widely expected to lose, all the polls said he was going to lose,
[52:56.400 --> 53:02.400]  he won, we just had the biggest democratic election in the world in India, guess who
[53:02.400 --> 53:08.960]  won by a landslide, a populist, so this trend isn't going away anytime soon, to zoom in
[53:08.960 --> 53:14.960]  on that, they're playing this numbers game where they say oh if we add up the vote for
[53:14.960 --> 53:21.360]  the Lib Dems, the Lib Dems were the party of Remain and then we had the change UK vote
[53:21.360 --> 53:26.120]  which was the Koch party which was completely pathetic, this was the so-called independent
[53:26.120 --> 53:30.800]  party which was started by establishment politicians who just left their establishment
[53:30.800 --> 53:36.320]  parties, they got 3%, they were completely crushed, they were beaten even by UKIP, so
[53:36.320 --> 53:42.320]  they say oh if we add up the Lib Dems, the Greens and the change UK party, that means
[53:42.320 --> 53:47.200]  that more people who wanted to remain in the EU won the election, well then you drill down
[53:47.200 --> 53:52.800]  to it and you look at what the Green Party voters wanted, their primary issue in the
[53:52.800 --> 53:59.120]  UK was quote they had the best policies on issues other than Brexit, so the people voting
[53:59.120 --> 54:03.840]  for the Green Party weren't voting for the Green Party because they were voting for Remain,
[54:03.840 --> 54:08.880]  they were voting for environmentalism, so this fake numbers game of oh if we add up
[54:08.880 --> 54:13.000]  these parties and these parties and these parties, it means we've won, it's like calling
[54:13.000 --> 54:20.200]  for a second referendum, but the other issue is with the Green Party, you also have in
[54:20.200 --> 54:27.160]  correlation with this populist right surge in Europe, you do have a populist left surge,
[54:27.160 --> 54:31.680]  so just as you've got your Bernie Sanders and your AOCs in America, you've got this
[54:31.680 --> 54:35.520]  kind of fringe far left populist surge which is happening at the same time.
[54:35.520 --> 54:38.920]  And by the way, as you're just saying, I see the numbers, there are a lot of leftist groups
[54:38.920 --> 54:43.000]  now in Germany that don't want open borders that want out of the EU as well because they
[54:43.000 --> 54:48.080]  know the plan is to take their pension funds, so what you're really saying is the left more
[54:48.080 --> 54:51.520]  and more is actually getting ready to join the populist movement.
[54:51.520 --> 54:57.520]  Well, yeah, but the problem is leftist parties are far better at forming coalitions both
[54:57.520 --> 55:01.480]  at national and European level, which is what you were talking about before the break,
[55:01.480 --> 55:05.680]  so you've got all these tons of different parties, libertarian, right-wing populists,
[55:05.680 --> 55:06.680]  whatever.
[55:06.680 --> 55:10.820]  They're all segregated and they find it very hard to communicate and join together because
[55:10.820 --> 55:14.360]  leftists being collectivists have always been better at that.
[55:14.360 --> 55:19.480]  The point many people are making today, how do you take a vote share out of that Green
[55:19.480 --> 55:23.800]  Party vote throughout Europe, because the Green Party throughout Europe in all these
[55:23.800 --> 55:29.360]  different countries have done very well for themselves, so you have to take on board some
[55:29.360 --> 55:33.440]  kind of environmentalist message with the populist right.
[55:33.440 --> 55:36.880]  This is what I told UKIP a year ago and they did it to some extent.
[55:36.880 --> 55:42.920]  They included it on their manifesto, trying to ban halal slaughter of animals, which is
[55:42.920 --> 55:45.800]  torturous and cruel in the United Kingdom.
[55:45.800 --> 55:51.760]  So although, obviously, as we've argued for two decades, man-made climate change is a
[55:51.760 --> 55:56.880]  complete scam, it's a Ponzi scheme, but that doesn't mean there aren't some real environmental
[55:56.880 --> 56:02.120]  issues which the populist right can address, which then we can take some of that vote share
[56:02.120 --> 56:07.360]  from the Green Party and it is things like halal slaughter, it is things like plastic
[56:07.360 --> 56:08.360]  in the oceans, deforestation.
[56:08.360 --> 56:09.360]  No, I agree.
[56:09.360 --> 56:10.360]  Paul, stay right there.
[56:10.360 --> 56:11.360]  These are real issues.
[56:11.360 --> 56:14.960]  Man-made global warming isn't, but you can take some of those issues and address them
[56:14.960 --> 56:15.960]  and get that vote.
[56:15.960 --> 56:16.960]  I agree.
[56:16.960 --> 56:21.720]  Run as environmentalist, but say global warming is a distraction from the overfishing, from
[56:21.720 --> 56:25.280]  the toxic waste dumping, from all of those issues, but come right back, continue your
[56:25.280 --> 56:30.560]  take and get Owen's take on all this, but the big takeaway, though, Paul, is, despite
[56:30.560 --> 56:36.520]  all the media blackouts, the attacks on patriot parties, they were the biggest winners overall
[56:36.520 --> 56:38.680]  and this scares the hell out of the establishment.
[56:38.680 --> 56:40.880]  We're going to go to break.
[56:40.880 --> 56:43.880]  Please don't forget, we're not funded by George Soros, we're not funded by the New World
[56:43.880 --> 56:46.680]  Order, we're funded by you, the listeners, and we're very, very respectful and very,
[56:46.680 --> 56:50.040]  very thankful, but quite frankly, if you're a viewer or a listener and haven't gone to
[56:50.040 --> 56:55.160]  themfullworkstore.com and gotten the Wake Up America coffee, or gotten fish oil, or gotten
[56:55.160 --> 56:58.840]  our protein bars that are back in stock, or gotten our amazing all day energy that's

[57:43.240 --> 57:49.280]  started in Russia, moved to the UK, came to the US, and is now going worldwide.
[57:49.280 --> 57:54.680]  The globalists are hyper competitive scientific dictators, they are technocrats, they are
[57:54.680 --> 57:58.720]  control freaks in their own words, and they believe allowing you to live your own life
[57:58.720 --> 58:03.840]  and make your own decisions, gets to the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[58:03.840 --> 58:07.520]  Now we're fighting them hard in cyberspace, we're fighting them hard right here in the
[58:07.520 --> 58:12.040]  third dimension, but one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really
[58:12.040 --> 58:15.000]  got a lot of control in our lives, is our bodies.
[58:15.000 --> 58:20.280]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from 4slife.com, I couldn't do it.

[01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:28.320]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's
[01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:29.320]  Alex Jones.
[01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:34.240]  All right, we could not be covering more weighty, hardcore topics that the globalist
[01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:38.800]  absolutely cannot stand and do not want to be on air.
[01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:44.240]  They want thousands of new Netflix shows a year, thousands of TV channels, thousands
[01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:48.280]  of gambling sites, just sex everywhere, drugs everywhere.
[01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:53.000]  And again, I'm not Mr. Goody Two Shoes on some mountain like I'm perfect.
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.560]  I'm just breaking down.
[01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:57.440]  The globalist have a total distraction going on.
[01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:58.440]  And Paul got caught off by the break.
[01:00:58.440 --> 01:00:59.960]  He was trying to finish a critical point.
[01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:00.960]  I could tell he was irritated.
[01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:02.520]  I was interrupting, but I had to plug there.
[01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:04.200]  I'm going to bring Olin in.
[01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:07.600]  Paul leaves us at about 15 minutes that we're going to open the phones up and get into all
[01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:08.600]  the other news.
[01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:16.920]  Separately, the news blackouts, the demonization, the no-platforming of nationalists and patriot
[01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:22.800]  candidates across Europe, Junkers' arrogant statements, talk by the major governments
[01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:26.640]  of outlawing nationalist parties.
[01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:33.040]  This is a devastating reversal for them to have Lepin beating Macron's party.
[01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:37.360]  And again, it's not like the U.S. where it's winter takes all, it's parliamentary.
[01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:39.760]  So they're taking more seats.
[01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:40.760]  European elections.
[01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:47.520]  Italy has now taken full control and is dominant, not just with the president, but in the parliament.
[01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:48.520]  That's huge.
[01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:49.520]  Salvini wins.
[01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:51.640]  Majority says a new Europe is born.
[01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:55.280]  Merkel already has lost, what, seven elections in a row now.
[01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:58.000]  France 24 says, will she have to step down?
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:02.120]  Will Nigel Farage become the next prime minister?
[01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:03.600]  Or will it be Boris?
[01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:07.560]  The point is, Owen earlier talked about how Trump supercharged nationalism two and a half
[01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:08.560]  years ago.
[01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:15.600]  But really, the only Russian conspiracy there is, Paul, is that Russia hit rock bottom,
[01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:20.200]  kicked some of the oligarchs out, created some of their sovereignty again, became Christian
[01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:21.200]  again.
[01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:25.280]  That's what pisses off Hollywood and the blood-sucking establishment.
[01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:27.600]  And so, UKIP's done that.
[01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:29.560]  Other nations are doing that.
[01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:34.840]  The US has done that, but this was all really let out of England, exploded in the US, spread
[01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:36.240]  all over the world.
[01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:37.240]  What a crazy time.
[01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:39.080]  You're trying to finish that point.
[01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:46.080]  No, obviously, yeah, it started back in the probably early 2000s, mid-2000s with the surge
[01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:47.080]  of UKIP.
[01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:52.200]  Obviously, we had the 2014 European parliamentary elections where UKIP won.
[01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:56.200]  The Brexit party, of course, this time won by a far bigger margin.
[01:02:56.200 --> 01:03:02.080]  Now, over 30% of seats in the European parliament are controlled by Euro-skeptic parties.
[01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:03.440]  That's the biggest ever.
[01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:08.920]  The so-called grand coalition of centre-right and centre-left parties, the establishment,
[01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:13.360]  they've lost their overall majority in the EU parliament for the first time ever.
[01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:14.840]  So it's horrific for them.
[01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:20.920]  But then look how, for example, CNBC responds to it today with telling us what the experts
[01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:22.000]  think about it.
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:28.040]  They say, Europeans showed belief in the EU project, experts claimed Monday, despite
[01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:30.880]  long dominant centrist parties losing ground.
[01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:36.640]  So it's actually saying the experts are telling us that the Brexit party having such success,
[01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:42.880]  Le Pen beating Macron, Salvini winning in Italy, that means that people believe in the EU project
[01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:43.880]  even more.
[01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:49.680]  Again, shows how completely out of touch they are, which benefits us, that they see this
[01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:55.960]  as a victory, that for the first time ever, the establishment coalition in the EU parliament
[01:03:55.960 --> 01:04:02.440]  has lost majority control, and they're out today spinning it as a victory for the establishment.
[01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:08.520]  All right, we've got one more segment with you, and Owen's got a lot to say in a chime
[01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:09.800]  in when we come back in about a minute.
[01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:14.440]  But the minute we have before we go to break, start giving us your view gut level.
[01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:16.640]  How is the establishment going to strike back?
[01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:20.720]  Multinational corporations that set up the EU, that set up the Chai comms, that set up
[01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:24.160]  the New World Order system in their own words to consolidate power.
[01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:25.160]  Think about that.
[01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:26.160]  We're going to go to break, Paul.
[01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:29.520]  I want to ask you, and Owen, out of the gates, they're going to strike back.
[01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:30.720]  They're striking back with censorship.
[01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:35.760]  They're striking back with leftist mobs being bullies and physically attacking people.
[01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:37.880]  They're striking back with corporate bullying.
[01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:40.080]  How else are they going to strike back?
[01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:46.480]  I smell false flage, but they're uncontrollable the governments now, and they know they could
[01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:47.480]  get caught.
[01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:52.480]  So, the walls are closing in on them, not us, but we shouldn't be arrogant.
[01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:58.800]  This is a critical time to stay frosty.
[01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:03.640]  Our powerful line of fluoride-free products is the perfect gift for yourself or others
[01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:06.920]  who are exploring a healthier, happier lifestyle.

[01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:34.320]  You've got it.
[01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:35.320]  It's done around drooling.
[01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:42.920]  We're the ghosts of the explorers, the trailblazers, the strivers.
[01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:45.480]  And we will go the stars.
[01:06:45.480 --> 01:06:47.320]  Get behind me, shakin'.
[01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:52.480]  O' and Shroyer ride to shotgun women's about to broadcast Paul Watson one more segment
[01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:53.480]  to both of you.
[01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:54.720]  Paul Joseph Watson first.
[01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:59.400]  than Owen Schreuer, devastating defeats for the globalists in Europe, devastating defeats
[01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:05.200]  in Brazil, devastating defeats in Asia, devastating defeats here. How are they going to strike
[01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:10.440]  back Paul Joseph Watson? Let's chronicle some of the ways they've already struck back and
[01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:14.560]  what they're going to do next, because one thing they never do is give up and their arrogance
[01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:20.280]  that is their weakness is also their strength with Yonker saying, you dumb Europeans, you
[01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:25.120]  little stupid, love your country, we get rid of Europe. Get rid of Europe and what? Let
[01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:29.520]  it be run by you, the Nazi heir, the dictator? How will they strike back Paul Watson from
[01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:42.120]  London, England? And his kite must have just cut out. All right, let's go to Owen. Owen,
[01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:47.440]  how do you think they strike back? Well, I think, I don't think this, I know that the
[01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:52.200]  first thing we're going to see is total social media censorship. I think all smart minds
[01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:58.000]  have been predicting this for a while. And so I would say by 2020, on Twitter and Facebook
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:02.840]  and YouTube, you won't even find a Trump supporter. This is going to be their last ditch effort
[01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:07.040]  to try to stop Trump from getting reelected. It'll be too late. This may even happen within
[01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:10.840]  the next couple of months or so. So I think total social media center, I mean, I've been
[01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:13.920]  banned on faith. Obviously, you can't allow it to be anywhere. I still have a Twitter
[01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:17.920]  account. I don't think I'll have that by 2020. And I don't think any other Trump supporters
[01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:22.480]  will either. I'm fully expecting that to happen. Now, what I'm afraid of, and you also alluded
[01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:27.880]  to this earlier, is a major false flag. They've already tried to pull a couple ones off with
[01:08:27.880 --> 01:08:32.320]  Jesse Smallette with the Covington Catholic hoax. But they're going to do an actual hot
[01:08:32.320 --> 01:08:38.480]  one is what I'm afraid of a hot false flag. And they're going to blame Trump supporters,
[01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:43.840]  like Nationalist or whatever they want to put on it. And that's going to be what they hope
[01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:48.600]  is a turning point to change the narrative. Because I mean, nobody believes CNN and MSNBC
[01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:52.000]  anymore. Everybody sees the facts. The left has gotten totally violent. In fact, they've
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:55.680]  even committed to domestic terror. In fact, Alex, I'll even tell you, I won't give all
[01:08:55.680 --> 01:09:02.000]  the information here, but I'm being publicly doxxed right now in Austin, Texas in an extreme
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:06.600]  manner. I think people are trying to sabotage me or even have me killed. So they're going
[01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:12.000]  to go full bore before 2020. And you better have your head on a swivel, you better have
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:17.080]  your head up, or you're going to get run over. We know the players, we know the game, watch
[01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:21.800]  it all come down. So that's what I'm expecting in the next up to 2020, Alex. But I think
[01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:26.680]  a hot false flag, and they're going to try to blame Trump and his supporters, it probably
[01:09:26.680 --> 01:09:30.280]  won't work. I mean, nothing, these people do works anymore. But that doesn't mean they're
[01:09:30.280 --> 01:09:36.840]  going to not do it. I totally agree with you. And the founder of Antifa that gets tens of
[01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:41.920]  millions of dollars from George Soros, he was on the young Turks two weeks ago, saying
[01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:48.120]  we're preparing a violent offensive revolution to take out Trump and his supporters. So they're
[01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:52.360]  not just anti free speech. And I agree, they're going to go to false flags. We'll get to this
[01:09:52.360 --> 01:09:58.360]  later. You've been doxxed. They're harassing you at your humble abode. And that's what
[01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:03.340]  this comes down to is that the left really believes this is their takeover time. They
[01:10:03.340 --> 01:10:06.720]  thought it was their takeover time with Hillary, but it's not happening. So as they get more
[01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:11.640]  apocalyptic, they're going to get violent. Paul Watson, you're over in the UK, you're
[01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:16.520]  covering all this. How do you see the establishment striking back?
[01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:22.520]  They're striking back, Alex, by fanning the flames of extremism. As I said before, people
[01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:26.840]  are becoming more disenfranchised, because their vote has been overridden and they're
[01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:31.480]  being told that their vote means nothing. So they're going to lash out in frustration.
[01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:36.360]  And that's exactly what the establishment wants, because then they can exploit it to
[01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:42.800]  reclassify speech that they hate as hate speech. And this is exactly what we're seeing with
[01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:49.000]  the de-platforming. It's no coincidence, Alex, that two weeks before the vote in Spain, the
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:55.240]  populist Vox party was completely de-platformed on Facebook, lost millions of followers. Oh,
[01:10:55.240 --> 01:11:00.800]  and look what happened. The Vox party underperformed in Spain. Well, what a coincidence. You had
[01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:06.040]  Tommy Robinson running a campaign off a Telegram app, basically, because they de-platformed
[01:11:06.040 --> 01:11:11.480]  him on everything else. He needed about 8% to win. He got about 3%, which is impressive
[01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:15.800]  for an independent candidate, by the way. But again, he had to fight this election with
[01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:22.280]  both arms tied behind his back, because they created the hysteria through the extremism
[01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:28.200]  which they found in the first place to create the justification to ban him on social media.
[01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:32.280]  And then they say that we're creating violence by our rhetoric saying we don't want to be
[01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:37.560]  globalist slaves. And then they come attack us, and then they take our speech saying we
[01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:39.960]  cause anti-foot of attack us.
[01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:45.000]  Yeah. They take away people's speech. They radicalize people. That's the effect that
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:49.280]  it has. If you take away people's access to public platforms to express their legitimate
[01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:55.400]  grievances, that only radicalizes them. So a small minority will lash out with violence,
[01:11:55.400 --> 01:11:59.960]  and that's exactly what they want, because they can exploit it to silence their competition.
[01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:02.720]  And that's what happened with Tommy and with Vox.
[01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:09.400]  And take Ireland. When the Irish finally figured out that British intelligence has been declassified,
[01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:13.840]  I had Stakeknife, codenamed Stakeknife on. He was killed two weeks later for coming on
[01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:18.360]  the show. Seriously, folks, I had Stakeknife on like 12 years ago. They murdered him. And
[01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:22.540]  he just said, I got tired of doing it. We would blow stuff up. We led the IRA. The Irish
[01:12:22.540 --> 01:12:29.440]  below us didn't know it. We'd break their legs or kill them if they didn't bomb stuff.
[01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:34.920]  And we were doing the bombings to discredit the Irish. So we had an excuse to stay there.
[01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:38.120]  And then real Irish would get desperate because they didn't have any speech, and they'd try
[01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:42.200]  to get guns that we'd actually have shipped to them. Then we'd ambush them and kill them.
[01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:47.000]  And I'm bashing the British on average themselves, but that's what the British government did
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:53.120]  was literally lead the IRA. And so they're going to lead everybody into radicalization.
[01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:56.120]  Our government's going to do it. The UK is going to do it. Germany's going to do it.
[01:12:56.120 --> 01:13:00.840]  They've got the German secret police leading the white supremacist groups that firebomb
[01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:05.280]  the Muslims and stuff so that then no one has speech to say, I don't want to bring in
[01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:10.560]  10 million more Muslims because the German intelligence is firebombing the Muslims to
[01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:12.920]  make them look like victims. Paul.
[01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:18.920]  Precisely. I mean, read the UN migration pact. It's about recategorizing criticism of mass
[01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:24.240]  immigration as hate speech and then intimidating the populace when they try and speak out about
[01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:28.320]  it. Look at what's happening in New Zealand. Not only are they confiscating the weapons,
[01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:33.920]  they're literally sending political police around to people's private homes to interrogate
[01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:39.080]  populace and conservatives because they express their opinions on social media. So that's
[01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:44.080]  exactly what's happening. It's about de-platforming. It's about intimidation, banning the flames
[01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:48.240]  of extremism to cause violence, which benefits them.
[01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:52.520]  Paul's about to leave us, Ellen. You and I will be taking over. We have plenty of time
[01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:56.520]  to talk and take calls and play clips and shift into some other facets of this. But
[01:13:56.520 --> 01:14:00.040]  do you have any questions for Paul? He's over there in the middle of this, lives in Spain,
[01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:04.680]  part of the year, lives in the UK, reports for summit.news, folks. Check out his excellent
[01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:05.680]  website, Ellen.
[01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:11.200]  Yeah, Paul, I was just wondering if you agree with some other people I've talked to in the
[01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:17.080]  UK that say the feeling right now is different than past times when there have been votes
[01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:22.520]  that look like the Brexit may actually happen. Do you have more confidence today in a Brexit
[01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:24.720]  than you did, say, a month ago?
[01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:30.200]  Oh, yeah. The mood in the UK in regards to Brexit, especially in no-deal Brexit, by the
[01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:36.520]  way, which the odds have gone down for, is way more positive than it was on March 31st.
[01:14:36.520 --> 01:14:41.400]  Because now, Farage has created this pressure group, which will pressure the Tories into
[01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:46.360]  electing a leader who will actually be able to carry off Brexit and get us out of the EU.
[01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:50.740]  So it's all about who's going to be the next Conservative leader. But in terms of the position
[01:14:50.740 --> 01:14:55.200]  that we're in compared to three months ago, with the meteoric rise of this party in just
[01:14:55.200 --> 01:14:59.080]  six weeks, there's way more optimism about actually achieving Brexit.
[01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:03.080]  Paul, that's my last question. Farage is a trailblazer and incredible leader. Another
[01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:08.400]  cement fighting between Brexit group in the UK. I think that should all end. He has leadership
[01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:13.080]  and charisma and history written all over him. I want to end up, if not this round, next
[01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:17.800]  round, seeing him become the Prime Minister of England and truly leads you guys out of
[01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:23.880]  the dark age and linking up with Trump, helping lead us out of it. We need him as a leader.
[01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:26.080]  England hasn't had a real leader in a long time.
[01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:31.480]  No, and the signs are pretty good. I mean, even in the national polls in some of them,
[01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:36.200]  Farage's Brexit Party is beating the Conservative Party. That's a ruling party. That's absolutely
[01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:41.160]  massive. It's one or two points behind Labour. And most of these Conservative Party members
[01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:45.680]  who've switched to the Brexit Party for this election say they're not going to go back
[01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:50.880]  to the Tories. So at the very least, he could end up in a coalition government and have
[01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:54.200]  that power like Salvini did in Italy with the Conservative Party.
[01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:57.280]  And then Catapult and in the Prime Minister's ship. Incredible, Paul. Thank you.
[01:15:57.280 --> 01:16:03.680]  Oh, these pains, my neck, my back, shoulders. I've got to get some relief.
[01:16:03.680 --> 01:16:08.160]  Stress from everyday life, past injuries or surgeries can cause inflammation that leads

[01:16:56.840 --> 01:17:02.200]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of
[01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:07.280]  the world. George Washington had warned us against foreign wars. The United States of
[01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:14.160]  Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken. Its former colony, the U.S.,
[01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:19.720]  had to save the empire. Was there ever a vote? Who do we fight for? The deep state began
[01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:26.560]  with World War I, the United States of Empire, by James Dunne, available at Amazon Books.

[01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:07.400]  full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it, that it lowers IQ. It
[01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:12.520]  literally dumbs the population down. And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers
[01:19:12.520 --> 01:19:18.880]  the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations. First, seaweed based iodine
[01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:22.160]  that was pretty good, but hard to source, and the globalists tried to block us getting
[01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:27.160]  a supply of it. So we discovered deep earth crystals, a pure nascent iodine and brought
[01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:32.120]  you X2. That's been incredible. Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we
[01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:38.000]  did more research and secured more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine. But chemists,
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:42.760]  scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds,
[01:19:42.760 --> 01:19:50.800]  two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable. Ladies
[01:19:50.800 --> 01:19:54.960]  and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[01:19:54.960 --> 01:20:01.040]  It's free. Now available at m4slife.com.
[01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:30.040]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:11.000]  All right, folks, I'm back live here a little bit late. I was working on some breaking news
[01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:18.760]  during the break. And as I was walking back into the studio live here, something really
[01:21:18.760 --> 01:21:28.560]  hit me that we have dropped the ball on that's beyond huge. It's everything. And next segment,
[01:21:28.560 --> 01:21:33.840]  I'm going to get into it, but it's one of those moments where God really touches you
[01:21:33.840 --> 01:21:38.320]  and you feel it and you know it. There's just a huge understanding. And so I'm gonna talk
[01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:42.120]  about that next segment. But, oh, and you've been sitting there patiently the last 45 minutes
[01:21:42.120 --> 01:21:47.880]  with Paul Watson on, chomping in the bit, making really great points. The historicness
[01:21:47.880 --> 01:21:51.760]  of what's happening, Trump saying trees and charges, trees and investigation, what we
[01:21:51.760 --> 01:21:58.200]  broke months ago. Again, this isn't a regular situation right now. This is a very special
[01:21:58.200 --> 01:22:02.960]  time, a very dangerous time. But our prayers are really being answered. People's actions
[01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:10.320]  are being answered. The Pope, who has acted like, you know, he's, he's, he's auditioning
[01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:14.520]  to work for Satan or something has come out against abortion and said that Planned Parenthood
[01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:19.160]  has hit men who want to murder children and destroy future generations. And he's even
[01:22:19.160 --> 01:22:23.880]  come out and said that if we don't have 2.1 kids for every two parents, there'll be nobody
[01:22:23.880 --> 01:22:29.920]  to take care of old people and that civilization will collapse. He's suddenly making anti-globalist
[01:22:29.920 --> 01:22:35.920]  statements. George Soros is coming out saying China's the enemy and is messing. I mean,
[01:22:35.920 --> 01:22:41.000]  they all understand they're losing. Again, it's not Catholics. The Pope's obviously globalist
[01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:46.440]  operative. Soros is starting to backtrack in many ways. These are big signs that globalism
[01:22:46.440 --> 01:22:52.280]  is in deep, deep crap. So give us your overall ballpark the next six minutes towards break
[01:22:52.280 --> 01:22:57.040]  about where you see this going. Well, you know how much they've invested to get to this
[01:22:57.040 --> 01:23:02.680]  point of the globalist agenda and the one world government. And so they can't just
[01:23:02.680 --> 01:23:07.160]  retract or lay down. They're going to have to do something to try to salvage this. Obviously,
[01:23:07.160 --> 01:23:13.280]  they see all the losses they're being dealt. But I think before 2020, the presidential
[01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:17.000]  election here in the United States, that's kind of their watermark. I mean, if Trump
[01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:21.880]  gets in again, and he brings down the deep state for treason, I mean, we know who he's
[01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:27.160]  talking about. It's Barack Obama. Barack Obama committed treason. And so that's bombshell
[01:23:27.160 --> 01:23:31.440]  stuff. You're talking about the last president of the United States. And so this is going
[01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:35.800]  to send shock waves around the world. And I think that the Soros is starting to feel
[01:23:35.800 --> 01:23:40.320]  it. I think that the Junkers are starting to feel it. And so there's going to be a trickle
[01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:45.120]  down effect though, Alex, and it's going to be just the average leftist minion out there
[01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:49.520]  that, you know, look, I don't even, I don't even want to go into the process of like insulting
[01:23:49.520 --> 01:23:54.600]  them or their intelligence or anything at this point. It's just like, you need to understand
[01:23:54.600 --> 01:24:04.080]  you're being used like a pawn in chess for a massive international criminal cabal. And
[01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:09.680]  you're basically just like a little cancer form on society to go out there and infect
[01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:15.680]  the culture and pretend like there's some sort of resistance to patriots and Christianity
[01:24:15.680 --> 01:24:20.560]  in the West and all of this stuff. It's all a big game of chess, Alex, as you know. So
[01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:23.800]  I'm afraid that they're about to get even hot. I mean, we don't have to talk about
[01:24:23.800 --> 01:24:27.000]  my situation or stuff that you've dealt with, but this is what it's coming down to.
[01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.800]  No, no, let's get to your situation at the start of the next hour, because I want to
[01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:34.480]  get into this. Well, this is the second. Don't worry. I already know about it. We're going
[01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:38.360]  to put some major heat on their ass legally and lawfully. See how they like it. This is
[01:24:38.360 --> 01:24:42.840]  the second time this has happened to me. And so the new place I moved in, I went through
[01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:47.480]  multiple measures to make sure that, you know, if somebody was able to find this address,
[01:24:47.480 --> 01:24:50.320]  whoever it wouldn't be linked to my name. Well, somehow they got it and they decided
[01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:54.040]  to post a bunch of flyers around town yesterday with my address. And to be honest with you,
[01:24:54.040 --> 01:24:57.560]  a bunch of people are saying like, you know, you should be afraid. Honestly, I wouldn't
[01:24:57.560 --> 01:25:02.280]  even be here right now if it wasn't for God. So I have no fear. And that's not even me
[01:25:02.280 --> 01:25:06.720]  bragging. Honestly, the way I behaved in some part of my life, I shouldn't even be here
[01:25:06.720 --> 01:25:11.360]  right now. So God had his hand on me. So that's why I really believe that. But my point is,
[01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:17.240]  like somebody is giving them this information. There's no way some leftist can just find
[01:25:17.240 --> 01:25:22.880]  my address. No, they have people like reality winner in the police departments in the FBI.
[01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:28.360]  And that's it exactly. So who knows if it's Google, it can't be social media. I don't
[01:25:28.360 --> 01:25:32.200]  think any of them have my address. Who knows if it's like a credit card company. I don't
[01:25:32.200 --> 01:25:37.320]  believe it's my bank. I have a great relationship with my bank. So I don't even know where they're
[01:25:37.320 --> 01:25:43.400]  going. But the point is, people need to understand if you're a lot of people have already been
[01:25:43.400 --> 01:25:47.360]  hit with the censorship, a lot of people have been hit with the Chase Bank, JP Morgan Chase,
[01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:50.480]  banning people. And there's other stuff that you got to know next. They come to your house,
[01:25:50.480 --> 01:25:56.040]  which doesn't intimidate us. It lets us know we're right about these people. And so I just
[01:25:56.040 --> 01:25:59.280]  wish they would understand how they're being used. Like it's the same thing. Like how am
[01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:05.080]  I your enemy? What freedoms is info wars taken from you? What freedoms have Alex Jones ever
[01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:10.360]  taken from you? What has Alex Jones ever done to the American public? And they sit here
[01:26:10.360 --> 01:26:13.860]  and they want to say, Oh, well, you're fake news. You're dangerous. You're a hate monger.
[01:26:13.860 --> 01:26:18.320]  And then they provide no quotes. Oh, the latest article in Atlantic Monthly, there's a bunch
[01:26:18.320 --> 01:26:24.680]  of them says that I'm an apex predator. No, the globalist are apex predators. And so that's
[01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:28.600]  the point exactly, Alex. You've never been in the government. You've never been in control
[01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:33.440]  of some multi billion dollar corporation that ships all this manufacturing to China or who
[01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:37.720]  knows where else? That's not you. You've done everything here. People come up in Austin
[01:26:37.720 --> 01:26:42.240]  and they say they hate Alex Jones. I say, why? Alex Jones has brought millions of dollars
[01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:46.720]  to your economy. Alex Jones has brought people here that work hard and pay taxes and try
[01:26:46.720 --> 01:26:51.040]  to build the infrastructure here. What has Alex Jones done that's so bad? What is so
[01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:54.240]  bad about Alex Jones? Well, we don't like his message. Well, why don't you like his
[01:26:54.240 --> 01:26:59.640]  message? What does he say? And then they can't give a quote. So while here's like a plea
[01:26:59.640 --> 01:27:04.360]  to the left out there, if Antifa, whoever it is, if you guys get this message, this
[01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:10.840]  is a plea, you are being used. And if you go down this path, Alex, I saw a group of
[01:27:10.840 --> 01:27:15.080]  Antifa walking around Austin yesterday with their faces covered. They're like strung out
[01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:21.280]  or something. I'm telling you, if you go down this path, it doesn't end well for you. They
[01:27:21.280 --> 01:27:26.960]  want you to be killed. Do you understand what I'm saying? You will be used as the Trojan
[01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:30.760]  horse to bring in. Well, I mean, let's just be honest, these people can't tie their shoelaces
[01:27:30.760 --> 01:27:37.040]  and I'm not bragging. But if I'm awake and focused, I can with a handgun at 50 yards,
[01:27:37.040 --> 01:27:41.360]  shoot a pattern like that. We got guys work at this office that I've seen at 50 yards
[01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:46.200]  can shoot to the same hole with a handgun. And I just feel sorry if people ever actually
[01:27:46.200 --> 01:27:51.480]  try something because because it doesn't have us a win. If some method comes to my house
[01:27:51.480 --> 01:27:55.560]  and they pull a gun and I kill them with a riot shotgun with double lot buck, I'm not
[01:27:55.560 --> 01:27:59.360]  going to feel good because that's just some zombie I had to put down. And that's what
[01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:03.920]  you're saying is it's so sad that they're so brainwashed and they work for the literal
[01:28:03.920 --> 01:28:10.680]  Nazis, Junker and Soros and the globalists. They work for the evil and they're just little
[01:28:10.680 --> 01:28:15.720]  weird methods that always wanted to be part of the power structure. And so now they think
[01:28:15.720 --> 01:28:20.440]  they scare people. But oh, and you probably don't know this. You probably don't know that
[01:28:20.440 --> 01:28:24.480]  some people saw an Antifa pointing guns at you a year and a half ago and threatened you
[01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:28.920]  and wouldn't let you in that public park. And I later just heard from a little bird
[01:28:28.920 --> 01:28:34.520]  that Antifa had a very bad day later. Well, and I'm actually amazed because I've had a
[01:28:34.520 --> 01:28:37.360]  lot of interactions with these people and they quit coming to my events. I mean, we
[01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:42.320]  had a big event yesterday at the Planned Parenthood over 200 people showed up and Antifa didn't
[01:28:42.320 --> 01:28:47.320]  show up except a couple, a couple of people wanted to go into a fight. I'm sad about it.
[01:28:47.320 --> 01:28:53.480]  I just heard from some very reputable people that a few people just got they fell down
[01:28:53.480 --> 01:28:56.560]  and they broke bones. Well, they're right back.

[01:33:04.040 --> 01:33:30.000]  show live raw and unfiltered. It's the Alex Jones show. Well, what's happening with
[01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:36.320]  globalist candidates losing all over the world? The biggest victories yet over a third of
[01:33:36.320 --> 01:33:43.320]  the seats in Europe and the EU parliament won by anti globalist that want to end the EU.
[01:33:43.320 --> 01:33:49.720]  That's despite all the media censorship, all the election fraud. It's huge because you
[01:33:49.720 --> 01:33:57.600]  understand that only a third in the EU parliament of the 40 states that are in it are up every
[01:33:57.600 --> 01:34:06.320]  two years. So there was only a third of the seats that were up. And most countries only
[01:34:06.320 --> 01:34:15.440]  had 10, 15% Euro skeptics before. Now it's all over 30%. That means in some countries,
[01:34:15.440 --> 01:34:26.200]  Euro skeptics got 70%. In countries like the UK, they got 35% or so. I mean, this spells
[01:34:26.200 --> 01:34:32.920]  defeat. Took two rounds. The nationalist, anti globalist have almost complete control
[01:34:32.920 --> 01:34:39.520]  of Italy now. Merkel's lost seven elections by incredible fraud. She stayed in control.
[01:34:39.520 --> 01:34:47.200]  But her party gets like 10% of the vote now. Her party's dead. It's all on Europe wars.com.
[01:34:47.200 --> 01:34:54.720]  It's all on news wars.com. We've got multiple reporters paid in Europe. We have multiple
[01:34:54.720 --> 01:35:02.360]  reporters paid in England. We have reporters here in the US. We are fighting hard. Thanks

[01:35:43.960 --> 01:35:53.200]  and that's how we finance this operation. But you know, even more important than the
[01:35:53.200 --> 01:35:59.080]  listeners, even more important than the AMNFM and TB affiliates, even more important than
[01:35:59.080 --> 01:36:06.360]  me or Owen Schreuer or this incredible crew that does a kick butt job and doesn't get
[01:36:06.360 --> 01:36:15.880]  enough credit for me, it comes down to God. We're on a planet in the middle of gorgeous
[01:36:15.880 --> 01:36:23.240]  space, way out on the edge of a little galaxy and Hubble telescope is photographed 500 billion
[01:36:23.240 --> 01:36:35.080]  plus galaxies and that's a 19 early 1990s telescope. They got new ones up there. They
[01:36:35.080 --> 01:36:43.400]  want to let us see what they're getting. I mean, we are little babies. But God told
[01:36:43.400 --> 01:36:48.880]  us 2000 years ago, there'll be a world government. There'll be a cashless system to buy and sell.
[01:36:48.880 --> 01:36:53.520]  It's only going to last a while. You've been given free will. I have to do this to you.
[01:36:53.520 --> 01:36:56.840]  But if you make the right choice, I'm waiting on the other side and I don't want to do this
[01:36:56.840 --> 01:37:02.920]  to you, but you've been given full consciousness as a little G. Only thing an omnipresent entity
[01:37:02.920 --> 01:37:08.720]  like God can do is create new creatures that have the seed of the universe in them and
[01:37:08.720 --> 01:37:17.200]  the potentiality to do anything. You have free will. You have a piece of God in you,
[01:37:17.200 --> 01:37:25.240]  a seed of the universe. And God literally, as the Bible says, God loves a sparrow of
[01:37:25.240 --> 01:37:30.520]  the field so much when it dies, a little bird. Imagine how much God loves you. But God isn't
[01:37:30.520 --> 01:37:38.760]  creating robots. And God already created the angels and gave them free will and a bunch
[01:37:38.760 --> 01:37:46.320]  of them turned against him. One third. Imagine we're dealing with God's malfunctioning,
[01:37:46.320 --> 01:37:52.440]  rebelling creation that was given free will Lucifer. And what does Lucifer want to do?
[01:37:52.440 --> 01:37:59.920]  Lucifer is jealous as hell. Imagine you're a 40 year old man and you weigh maybe a hundred
[01:37:59.920 --> 01:38:04.800]  pounds and it's not bad if you're small, but you want to mean and and you're a drug addict
[01:38:04.800 --> 01:38:09.160]  and you're a child molester and you're a criminal. And then you've got a little cousin who's
[01:38:09.160 --> 01:38:13.480]  super handsome and super smart. And you know, he's going to get this big inheritance of
[01:38:13.480 --> 01:38:19.920]  a billion dollar company, but he's three years old. If you could get control of him for a
[01:38:19.920 --> 01:38:24.600]  month or a year, you could convince him to jump into a well and die. You can convince
[01:38:24.600 --> 01:38:30.880]  him to play in traffic. All you want to do is kill him because he has the inheritance.
[01:38:30.880 --> 01:38:37.480]  He has the birthright. You don't have it. You're Lucifer. You're really old. Hundred
[01:38:37.480 --> 01:38:43.120]  billion trillion years old. Who knows? God gave us the whole blueprint to beat him. God
[01:38:43.120 --> 01:38:47.840]  gave us a cheat sheet. Listen, I want you to join me, but I got to do this to you because
[01:38:47.840 --> 01:38:54.840]  it's free will. I don't want slaves. I create robots or servants all day. I love you so
[01:38:54.840 --> 01:39:01.320]  much. I'm putting everything I have got into you, but just please, please, please listen
[01:39:01.320 --> 01:39:05.280]  to me and just don't do these things because it'll bring you down. I want to be with you
[01:39:05.280 --> 01:39:11.120]  and God cries for all of us that fall to the devil. This is real folks. This whole planet
[01:39:11.120 --> 01:39:17.000]  is a test. We're such a powerful weapon system. If we go bad, we're way out in the corner
[01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:21.960]  of the universe, not just in the galaxy. We're like been towed way out in the middle of nowhere.
[01:39:21.960 --> 01:39:30.720]  We're the weapon folks. You think we're doing something now, man? See what we already built?
[01:39:30.720 --> 01:39:36.600]  Devil can't build all this stuff. The devil tricks us to build it, but twist it for him.
[01:39:36.600 --> 01:39:42.520]  That's why they're so pissed because we've got their number. So I was thinking during
[01:39:42.520 --> 01:39:50.080]  the break before last, I went from one building to the next. I was hurrying back over here
[01:39:50.080 --> 01:39:57.360]  with some articles and I stumbled over the door frame and fell on my face. I want to
[01:39:57.360 --> 01:40:05.320]  hit my face and sprung back up. I went, we're not thanking God for globalism under attack.
[01:40:05.320 --> 01:40:09.600]  Globalism failing everywhere. Humanity starting to reignite and then we're bitching and complaining
[01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:13.720]  that it's not good enough. It's not fast enough and Trump doesn't do everything we want. Well,
[01:40:13.720 --> 01:40:21.640]  what are you doing? What am I doing? But it hit me. If we seek God's face, if we repent,
[01:40:21.640 --> 01:40:25.000]  what's that verse? It's out there hanging on the wall. That if we seek God's face, if
[01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:29.560]  we repent, that He'll come and He'll heal our land and we're seeing the beginnings
[01:40:29.560 --> 01:40:35.720]  of that. We've got a long way to go, but we really should thank God for what's happening
[01:40:35.720 --> 01:40:40.120]  and thank God for all the gifts and the gift of consciousness and the gift of God being
[01:40:40.120 --> 01:40:46.560]  willing to create his own children and put them because I've got four children and you
[01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:49.440]  have children and you're putting them into the world and they're going to live, they're
[01:40:49.440 --> 01:40:53.000]  going to die, they're going to be in car wrecks and they're going to get cancer, hopefully
[01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:57.280]  not or heart attacks, you know, but they're going to live and their consciousness is real
[01:40:57.280 --> 01:41:02.160]  and they've got a soul. So you put them into the world because you want to have the children
[01:41:02.160 --> 01:41:05.760]  and you want to love them and you hope they grow up right. Well, that's how it is with
[01:41:05.760 --> 01:41:12.120]  God, but a trillion times bigger, infinity bigger and God loves us way more than any
[01:41:12.120 --> 01:41:16.920]  of us love our children. Imagine loving your child a thousand times that, knowing that
[01:41:16.920 --> 01:41:23.600]  child's potential, being omnipresent, but turning them loose in a pack of hyena like
[01:41:23.600 --> 01:41:29.640]  devils because it's what you've got to do because they deserve consciousness and you're
[01:41:29.640 --> 01:41:35.280]  not God's not going to intervene other than touching our heart and giving us the blueprint.
[01:41:35.280 --> 01:41:40.520]  But if we reject God and we climb up on top that devil, it's going to lead us right into
[01:41:40.520 --> 01:41:47.920]  hell. And so we should all thank God and sending his son Jesus Christ as an example to us all
[01:41:47.920 --> 01:41:52.160]  because that's what this is all about. And the enemy hates it when we talk about Christ
[01:41:52.160 --> 01:41:56.960]  more than anything. And the persecution of Christians is more than any other group because
[01:41:56.960 --> 01:42:01.920]  it's real. It's a blueprint. What you're told in the Bible is real, not their misinterpretations,
[01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:09.520]  not their twisting, but the reality that God created us on this planet out of his own nostrils,
[01:42:09.520 --> 01:42:23.200]  out of his own breath, out of his own DNA. But he would let his own rebellious servant
[01:42:23.200 --> 01:42:31.120]  come against us to test us so that we would be good sons and daughters in the future.
[01:42:31.120 --> 01:42:35.960]  And then God has to sit there and watch billions of his sons and daughters fall to evil and
[01:42:35.960 --> 01:42:42.680]  be destroyed and be sucked in by these devils and taken into a black hole into a pit forever.
[01:42:42.680 --> 01:42:47.800]  That's what God did for consciousness. That's what God did to make you. That's what God
[01:42:47.800 --> 01:42:57.960]  did to give you this incredible power. You think about that. Now you know God.

[01:43:04.680 --> 01:43:10.600]  backed up with human waste and debris. This is from people flushing things that aren't

[01:44:02.640 --> 01:44:11.400]  western world history. This is a digital, AI-enforced gag order. Not to say the name
[01:44:11.400 --> 01:44:22.240]  Alex Jones or infowars.com. This is Nazi Germany level. This is racketeering. This
[01:44:22.240 --> 01:44:29.320]  is cartels. Mr. President, we need your help. We need it now. You can take on Big Tech.
[01:44:29.320 --> 01:44:36.680]  They saw infowars as a dominant, independent, anti-war, pro-human, pro-sovereign, pro-family,
[01:44:36.680 --> 01:44:41.960]  populist organization. So they thought first they come for Alex Jones, then when people
[01:44:41.960 --> 01:44:46.520]  say, okay, take him off the air, everyone else like dominoes would fall. The way to
[01:44:46.520 --> 01:44:51.760]  fight back is to support infowars now more than ever and make it a standard of freedom
[01:44:51.760 --> 01:44:55.920]  and free speech. Understand that they believe they can take us down. They'll take everybody
[01:44:55.920 --> 01:44:58.760]  else down.

[01:47:52.840 --> 01:48:05.240]  father'll be there with her if he only could. But don't play with me cause you're playing
[01:48:05.240 --> 01:48:11.720]  with fire. Welcome back, my friends. Alex Jones here with Owen Schreuer. Oh, and you
[01:48:11.720 --> 01:48:16.920]  heard my breakdown about God. And when I even try to go on air and talk about thanking God,
[01:48:16.920 --> 01:48:23.640]  I feel like I'm wearing dirty sackcloth like the Bible talks about. The difference is,
[01:48:23.640 --> 01:48:29.920]  we know we're weak in front of God. The globalists feel that weakness and so they reject God.
[01:48:29.920 --> 01:48:38.000]  And I just wanted to make the point that for every action, there's an opposite and equal
[01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:43.080]  reaction and really amazing things are happening to the globalist. And it's not about kissing
[01:48:43.080 --> 01:48:48.400]  Trump's ass because he's quote powerful. He was powerful for evil than I would oppose
[01:48:48.400 --> 01:48:54.280]  him. He's obviously doing good. The enemy hates him. It's not a fake attack. It's real.
[01:48:54.280 --> 01:48:56.920]  They're getting more hysterical by the moment. It's happening all over the world. It's not
[01:48:56.920 --> 01:49:02.520]  just Trump. But an example is how they had a CNN article I ever got to yesterday. I'm
[01:49:02.520 --> 01:49:11.080]  going to cover about something like CNN.com. The nightmare. It was even worried like the
[01:49:11.080 --> 01:49:15.840]  hell, the dread. I've read the exact headline. I think he's trying to pull it up. The dread,
[01:49:15.840 --> 01:49:21.000]  the nightmare of Air Force One. He sleeps for hours. He's reading policy reports. He's
[01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:25.160]  on the phone to world leaders and business leaders hyping up America. He doesn't sleep.
[01:49:25.160 --> 01:49:31.680]  He reads hundreds of newspapers. It's insane. And he'll go to more countries than anybody
[01:49:31.680 --> 01:49:35.640]  else just like he would go like eight places in one day on the election. There it is. Inside
[01:49:35.640 --> 01:49:41.080]  Trump's Air Force One, it's like being held captive. And the article goes on to say just
[01:49:41.080 --> 01:49:46.080] ... But wait, I thought he lays around all day and doesn't work at the White House or
[01:49:46.080 --> 01:49:50.120]  anywhere else. I thought he didn't want to be the president. Again, they think we don't
[01:49:50.120 --> 01:49:57.880]  have memories. It's not about kissing Trump's ass. It's about kissing the truth's butt.
[01:49:57.880 --> 01:50:02.600]  Just like they say things about us, it doesn't get to me that they have NPR specials every
[01:50:02.600 --> 01:50:07.680]  week lying about me. It's that none of it's true. There's some real stuff I've done in
[01:50:07.680 --> 01:50:13.520]  my life. I would tell people I'm not perfect. They'll have an NPR special about me admitting
[01:50:13.520 --> 01:50:19.200]  I financed abortions. And then I am ashamed of it to this day, even though I believe the
[01:50:19.200 --> 01:50:23.840]  hype back when I was a teenager. I've said my sense. I'm not proud of them. I'm not an
[01:50:23.840 --> 01:50:30.840]  arrogant, puffed up person. How good I am. But to be accused of things I've never done,
[01:50:30.840 --> 01:50:37.880]  it's how they create this whole tissue of lies, whole tapestries of things I never said,
[01:50:37.880 --> 01:50:43.520]  I never did. It's all lies and they know they're lying. And that's how they create the false
[01:50:43.520 --> 01:50:49.700]  histories to destroy us and lay traps for us. And to watch these demonic hunchbacks
[01:50:49.700 --> 01:50:54.680]  get away with it over and over again, makes me sick. But again, it doesn't matter because
[01:50:54.680 --> 01:51:00.320]  they're fighting so hard. Oh, and because they know their time is short. They know the
[01:51:00.320 --> 01:51:04.800]  sun is setting on them. They know the book of life is closing on them. They know that
[01:51:04.800 --> 01:51:08.680]  a new world is about to be formed. That's why they launched their fake new age because
[01:51:08.680 --> 01:51:16.840]  God is the real new age. They are the counterfeit of the new system that's coming. And they're
[01:51:16.840 --> 01:51:23.560]  very, very, very afraid because it's not the fake Bible thumper view that the universe
[01:51:23.560 --> 01:51:30.680]  really is. It's it's it's interfacing with omnipresence and they can't do it. They're
[01:51:30.680 --> 01:51:36.360]  broken. Where do you think this goes on? Well, we use the three dimensional test. We called
[01:51:36.360 --> 01:51:43.760]  it the Trump test. And it was kind of just a a demarcation line to say, who in media
[01:51:43.760 --> 01:51:48.920]  is legit? Who's a sellout? Who in the government's legit? Who's a sellout? And it was just kind
[01:51:48.920 --> 01:51:52.360]  of a basic Trump test. I mean, are you going to be honest about Trump or are you going
[01:51:52.360 --> 01:51:55.720]  to lie about Trump? That doesn't mean you have to agree with everything Trump does or
[01:51:55.720 --> 01:51:59.280]  says. It just means are you going to go with the false narrative that he's racist, you
[01:51:59.280 --> 01:52:03.400]  know, Nazi, whatever other BS they put out there? Or are you going to be fair in the
[01:52:03.400 --> 01:52:07.760]  coverage and say, no, Trump is, you know, here's what he's doing. But you see a story
[01:52:07.760 --> 01:52:13.440]  like that from CNN. And it really doesn't surprise me that CNN would put that out because
[01:52:13.440 --> 01:52:18.680]  my guess is you have somebody maybe CNN gets some media member on board Air Force One for
[01:52:18.680 --> 01:52:24.680]  a stint or something just to write that story. And yeah, they probably don't work that hard.
[01:52:24.680 --> 01:52:28.600]  You know, it's not easy to work here. I bet it's not easy to work for Donald Trump. In
[01:52:28.600 --> 01:52:33.560]  fact, I bet it's really hard. And so maybe some people can't handle it. And so if you
[01:52:33.560 --> 01:52:36.040]  can't handle it, then you know what, maybe you can't handle it. And that's why a lot
[01:52:36.040 --> 01:52:38.800]  of people come and go from this White House administration.
[01:52:38.800 --> 01:52:42.400]  But to sit here and act like there aren't people that work every day for Donald Trump
[01:52:42.400 --> 01:52:49.580]  that aren't humbled and honored and just feel the privilege of that ability to change the
[01:52:49.580 --> 01:52:54.000]  world with this man right now. I mean, I'm not surprised that CNN would be totally out
[01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:57.600]  of touch with that reality. Well, that's my point is that they're saying he's a lazy
[01:52:57.600 --> 01:53:02.720]  ass. He doesn't want to be president, but everything else shows the opposite. They write an article
[01:53:02.720 --> 01:53:07.840]  about the feverish trips that no one does two countries a day. He's not sleeping. He's
[01:53:07.840 --> 01:53:14.320]  a maniac. So which is it? All I'm saying is they they insult us as if we can't remember
[01:53:14.320 --> 01:53:17.560]  this as if we can't differentiate.
[01:53:17.560 --> 01:53:23.960]  But let's bring it back to the four dimensional nine dimensional God model, which is when
[01:53:23.960 --> 01:53:29.280]  we go out and do these events, Alex, you can actually see demons come out of these people.
[01:53:29.280 --> 01:53:34.480]  It's not fun to watch. I mean, you really wonder what is going through. Let's talk
[01:53:34.480 --> 01:53:39.200]  about that. You went out to do a pro live demonstration yesterday and and we have new
[01:53:39.200 --> 01:53:42.680]  videos. We have a new video that we aired Sunday. We're going to queue it up where the
[01:53:42.680 --> 01:53:46.360]  because the other day I said this is the woman saying kill babies up to age three. Then the
[01:53:46.360 --> 01:53:50.960]  woman just said kill babies anytime. No, we had another video. The woman says kill babies
[01:53:50.960 --> 01:53:54.600]  up to age three, which is actually what they teach at universities now. They're not a human
[01:53:54.600 --> 01:53:58.840]  till age three. It's bioethics. Then it's age 10, then it's age 70. Get rid of old, get
[01:53:58.840 --> 01:54:04.040]  rid of young. We have that clip. Let's let's find that for next hour. But exactly tell
[01:54:04.040 --> 01:54:07.000]  folks what it's like to face these people.
[01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:10.840]  Well here in Austin, like I said, they quit coming to my events for some reason. I think
[01:54:10.840 --> 01:54:14.400]  that's because I kind of schooled Antifa a couple times and then just got real with
[01:54:14.400 --> 01:54:18.160]  them on a one on one level. And so they just quit bothering with me. But there were a couple
[01:54:18.160 --> 01:54:21.480]  that made it out. We were just outside of Planned Parenthood yesterday. You know, there's
[01:54:21.480 --> 01:54:26.120]  some good news in Texas. We got two bills, Senate bill 22. I think it's the right to
[01:54:26.120 --> 01:54:30.880]  protect life bill. If there's a baby that's born, you know, a failed abortion, the law
[01:54:30.880 --> 01:54:35.160]  on the bills on the governor's desk, it'll probably be signed. The law now will state
[01:54:35.160 --> 01:54:40.920]  that that you cannot abort that. So already born, baby, ain't gonna get cut up a seven
[01:54:40.920 --> 01:54:44.600]  pounds of me. Yeah, hopefully we're not going to be doing that here in Texas. And then there's
[01:54:44.600 --> 01:54:51.880]  another bill that says any institution that does abortions can no longer get any government
[01:54:51.880 --> 01:54:57.160]  contracts, no more taxpayer dollars. That bill is about to go to a Texas state Senate
[01:54:57.160 --> 01:55:01.440]  that's controlled by Republicans and then on to the governor's desk. So we're just
[01:55:01.440 --> 01:55:06.480]  out here bringing awareness to this. And Alex, we're out there for about three hours. And
[01:55:06.480 --> 01:55:10.600]  like I said, there wasn't any big Antifa groups. There were a couple that showed up. Obviously,
[01:55:10.600 --> 01:55:14.880]  there was some guy that was publishing flyers around town with my address trying to dox me.
[01:55:14.880 --> 01:55:18.520]  There were a couple of people that showed up on the road with flickers off through things
[01:55:18.520 --> 01:55:21.960]  at us. A guy, you know, almost got off his motorcycle. He was screaming at us. And then
[01:55:21.960 --> 01:55:26.320]  there was one guy who I guess was the only Antifa that showed up. It's funny. He shows
[01:55:26.320 --> 01:55:29.720]  up in a ski mask because I guess he's afraid that we're going to throw acid on his eyes
[01:55:29.720 --> 01:55:35.000]  when that's what they do. And then he's actually having a fair conversation with our reporter
[01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:39.400]  Savannah Hernandez who had a neutral mic flag. And so they're just talking. And so I just
[01:55:39.400 --> 01:55:43.520]  go over, I'm not even talking. And I just put the infowars mic out there just to get
[01:55:43.520 --> 01:55:47.440]  the conversation. And all of a sudden he gets upset and wants to quit talking to me. And
[01:55:47.440 --> 01:55:51.000]  then when he finds out Savannah works here too, he decides he's going to leave. And this
[01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:56.480]  is like a 40 year old man on his way out. I used to do this when I was like nine, Alex,
[01:55:56.480 --> 01:56:01.160]  like I was a little prankster when I was nine in the schoolyard. 40 year old man walks away
[01:56:01.160 --> 01:56:06.840]  and lights off three stink bombs on his way out. Now you remember me and you were out
[01:56:06.840 --> 01:56:10.720]  there one time when you were bullhorning that event that was in town, I think it was, it
[01:56:10.720 --> 01:56:14.840]  was named Donald Trump and Alex Jones fake news. They shut down town, shut down Congress
[01:56:14.840 --> 01:56:18.160]  and I wouldn't even let me in the event was about me. Yeah, they tried to hit me and they
[01:56:18.160 --> 01:56:23.920]  hit you with a, with a bag of feces. Literally the guy drives by on his bike and, and who
[01:56:23.920 --> 01:56:27.760]  knows what it was he threw out there. Well, if I admit that they take bags of urine and
[01:56:27.760 --> 01:56:31.760]  feces and rot them. And that's what you got hit with. To get back to what you were talking
[01:56:31.760 --> 01:56:35.920]  about in the last segment, Alex, it's like, I don't even know how to explain it because
[01:56:35.920 --> 01:56:39.160]  I mean, honestly, it's a, it's a humbling thing and it doesn't come off that way. But
[01:56:39.160 --> 01:56:48.280]  it's like God always chose you, but you have to choose God. And so if you don't choose
[01:56:48.280 --> 01:56:52.520]  God, then you're never going to be on the right path. You're never going to fulfill
[01:56:52.520 --> 01:56:59.240]  your destiny. You're never going to go down whatever your fate was designed to be by God.
[01:56:59.240 --> 01:57:04.120]  You're going to go down the left hand path, the devil's path. And so it's like, I mean,
[01:57:04.120 --> 01:57:07.640]  I don't even feel like I want to go, I'm not even trying to bring demons out. I'm not even
[01:57:07.640 --> 01:57:12.800]  trying to expose the devil. I'm just trying to do political activism and support my country
[01:57:12.800 --> 01:57:16.040]  and my president. And all I do is run into these demons everywhere I go.
[01:57:16.040 --> 01:57:20.560]  Well, and that's the crazy thing is once you realize there's left hand, right hand path,
[01:57:20.560 --> 01:57:24.240]  power money, nothing means anything anymore. You're once you know it's all spiritual. This
[01:57:24.240 --> 01:57:29.160]  is only level one. They're like, just I want to go with God. Let me on that. It's like
[01:57:29.160 --> 01:57:33.240]  nothing matters. There's no more fear anymore. No more fear of a bullet, no more fear of
[01:57:33.240 --> 01:57:37.520]  an audit, no more fear of death, except you want to keep fighting in the mission. That's
[01:57:37.520 --> 01:57:41.800]  the only fear you have is being taken out of the game. But it doesn't matter. God works
[01:57:41.800 --> 01:57:47.640]  some mysterious waves. And as I've told them, we're only the latest wave.
[01:57:47.640 --> 01:57:52.240]  Everybody knows that supplements are amazing. That what God gave us from other nature is
[01:57:52.240 --> 01:57:55.800]  incredible. That's why supplements are the biggest growing industry in the world. And
[01:57:55.800 --> 01:58:02.160]  the globalists are so upset. The problem is people forget to take them. And that's why
[01:58:02.160 --> 01:58:06.080]  the whole industry has moved towards packets that you take in the morning and you take
[01:58:06.080 --> 01:58:11.240]  at night. So we looked at that. We made the very best AM and PM packets out there with

[01:58:50.440 --> 01:58:56.320]  in modern medicine introducing pollen block. We have found an extraordinary new natural
[01:58:56.320 --> 01:59:02.720]  way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways,
[01:59:02.720 --> 01:59:09.040]  eye comfort and respiratory function. In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that
[01:59:09.040 --> 01:59:15.000]  people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:19.680]  They began studying this effect in published trials. And decades later, we now have the
[01:59:19.680 --> 01:59:24.960]  fruit of this research, a fast acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress
[01:59:24.960 --> 01:59:31.080]  symptoms. Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine. In fact, current
[01:59:31.080 --> 01:59:35.480]  research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase, which
[01:59:35.480 --> 01:59:41.480]  is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body. Go outside and enjoy
[01:59:41.480 --> 01:59:47.120]  the air you breathe. Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable
[01:59:47.120 --> 01:59:54.120]  tablets. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:00:17.120 --> 02:00:31.920]  You know, they were just asking me on this live Monday, Memorial Day broadcast, what
[02:00:31.920 --> 02:00:36.480]  do we call the last two segments? And that stuff, we talked about it's so heavy, it's
[02:00:36.480 --> 02:00:42.440]  so real. I don't know a headline. You know, God's the ultimate weapon against evil. How
[02:00:42.440 --> 02:00:48.400]  I found God in the fight against the globalist. You get into this and it really is good versus
[02:00:48.400 --> 02:00:52.560]  evil like everybody said before us. You grow up and you're a kid and the media makes fun
[02:00:52.560 --> 02:00:57.000]  of you're like, Oh, the old timers, good and evil, the devil. There are people that will
[02:00:57.000 --> 02:01:01.920]  go out of their way all day to do something bad to the innocent than to do something good
[02:01:01.920 --> 02:01:07.560]  for the innocent that helps them because spiritually, they're signed on to it. I want to get into
[02:01:07.560 --> 02:01:12.920]  politics. I want to get Dan Lyman on with us next segment from Europe with the huge
[02:01:12.920 --> 02:01:13.920]  developments there.
[02:01:13.920 --> 02:01:19.720]  But when it comes down to it, I've been there with you on you've been there with me out.
[02:01:19.720 --> 02:01:27.240]  People see the videos online. We don't go out to university or an abortion clinic and
[02:01:27.240 --> 02:01:32.000]  then see a bunch of weird zombies saying I love Satan who are who aren't like trying
[02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:37.360]  to freak us out. This is their operating system and talking about how much they love to kill
[02:01:37.360 --> 02:01:44.840]  kids and stuff or play clip of the moment. They all like their shoulders hang down. They're
[02:01:44.840 --> 02:01:49.720]  like zombies. They can hardly talk. Their eyes roll back on their heads. There's some
[02:01:49.720 --> 02:01:57.520]  type of operating spirit or system that's been downloaded into them and they're gone
[02:01:57.520 --> 02:02:02.320]  and you can't seem to get to them and you want to save them. So we don't take pleasure
[02:02:02.320 --> 02:02:07.280]  in the fact that they're quote libtards. They're infested by something. What do you think it
[02:02:07.280 --> 02:02:08.280]  is?
[02:02:08.280 --> 02:02:12.720]  Well, I think there's a distinction between because there's obviously Democrat voters
[02:02:12.720 --> 02:02:18.120]  or liberals out there, but there's a clear distinction between those that have consciously
[02:02:18.120 --> 02:02:23.880]  given over their soul to evil. And you can see the difference. They don't want to exist.
[02:02:23.880 --> 02:02:28.200]  And by the way, more and more Democrats to interrupt. I gotta say this used to as a small
[02:02:28.200 --> 02:02:32.960]  percentage of Democrat leaders were like demons. They're converting. Most their people are
[02:02:32.960 --> 02:02:34.760]  converting to it now.
[02:02:34.760 --> 02:02:40.760]  Well, look, there's signs all around us, too. I mean, just look at, you know, we don't celebrate,
[02:02:40.760 --> 02:02:45.280]  you know, these people getting ill if that's the case, but just look at Nancy Pelosi. She
[02:02:45.280 --> 02:02:49.480]  can't even get through a press conference without stammering like a drunken fool. Look
[02:02:49.480 --> 02:02:53.120]  at Jerry Nadler, the guy literally passes out. It looked like he was having a stroke
[02:02:53.120 --> 02:02:57.840]  or something in the middle of a press conference. So it's just like in the 2016 Hillary Clinton
[02:02:57.840 --> 02:03:03.280]  coughing through debates. Hillary Clinton falling downstairs and he looks like a little
[02:03:03.280 --> 02:03:06.680]  rumple stills condiment.
[02:03:06.680 --> 02:03:11.440]  So the signs are all around us, but if you've consciously given yourself over to evil, if
[02:03:11.440 --> 02:03:17.600]  you've consciously rejected your creator, then yeah, you have downloaded the devil has
[02:03:17.600 --> 02:03:22.400]  successfully downloaded into your soul. I mean, that's you. There's famous interviews
[02:03:22.400 --> 02:03:26.800]  out there. I mean, the most recent one I can remember would be like a Katy Perry, but there's
[02:03:26.800 --> 02:03:30.720]  all kinds of it. They talk about, yeah, I had to sell my soul to the devil to be successful.
[02:03:30.720 --> 02:03:35.360]  Katy Perry was a famous Christian singer. Nobody knew of her. She wanted to be famous.
[02:03:35.360 --> 02:03:40.040]  She wanted to be rich. She wanted to be on the top album charts. So she said she sold
[02:03:40.040 --> 02:03:41.040]  her soul.
[02:03:41.040 --> 02:03:44.960]  I've had her father on Dave Mustang got him on. I can't tell you the behind the scene
[02:03:44.960 --> 02:03:50.440]  stuff they told me he admitted some of it on air. No, she literally did that with the
[02:03:50.440 --> 02:03:54.960]  devil for power and people go to Hollywood. Mark Dice got called in a room. I was called
[02:03:54.960 --> 02:03:58.560]  in a room too, but I promise I'll talk about it. Soft records. So I want, but they told
[02:03:58.560 --> 02:04:02.960]  Mark Dice, will you worship Satan for this TV show? And he said, no, and it wasn't a
[02:04:02.960 --> 02:04:10.720]  joke. It's real because they understand once you have laid your guard down, once you've
[02:04:10.720 --> 02:04:15.760]  consciously accepted that, then you're out. I mean, that's it. You have sold your soul.
[02:04:15.760 --> 02:04:19.760]  I mean, the Bible says that there's always forgiveness. There's always redemption. So
[02:04:19.760 --> 02:04:26.400]  perhaps there always is, but if you've consciously neglected the creator and you've decided
[02:04:26.400 --> 02:04:31.360]  to go with the, with against natural, then that's the ultimate sin. The Holy spirit comes.
[02:04:31.360 --> 02:04:35.840]  You reject it. You say, I choose Satan for power. And then you look like a green goblin.
[02:04:35.840 --> 02:04:40.000]  Your face is green. You scream at the sky and you can't accept the reality for what
[02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:44.960]  it is. And whatever the devil wants you to be a tool for him, that's what you'll be.
[02:04:44.960 --> 02:04:49.680]  And you, and you think you're in power because of the false paradigm you're in the dream,
[02:04:49.680 --> 02:04:56.320]  the hoax, the spell, but you just run around howling at the sky, pooping on yourself.

[02:06:25.280 --> 02:06:34.080]  May 27th, 2019. We're broadcasting worldwide. Owen Schreuer is riding shotgun with me.
[02:06:35.360 --> 02:06:42.320]  Tom Papert hosts the fourth hour. We've got Dan Lyman of Europe Wars.com about to give us
[02:06:42.320 --> 02:06:48.560]  his expert take on what just unfolded a major route for the forces of world government a time
[02:06:48.560 --> 02:06:53.680]  to thank God for what's unfolding. But, Owen, putting bookends on what we covered the last three
[02:06:53.680 --> 02:07:00.160]  segments. This is footage of Caitlin Bennett in Austin. He was there as well with Millie Weaver
[02:07:00.160 --> 02:07:05.040]  a few days ago. We've got a bunch of footage saying killed children, get rid of them, kill
[02:07:05.040 --> 02:07:10.480]  them up to age three. That's Dr. Peter Singer. That's actually the eugenics bioethics boards
[02:07:10.480 --> 02:07:17.600]  that I learned about 18 years ago. The next phase would be kill kids up to age three. I've been
[02:07:17.600 --> 02:07:21.760]  saying this hundreds of times on air the last few months since the governor of Virginia, who's a
[02:07:21.760 --> 02:07:28.640]  medical doctor, said we after they ball, we keep them comfortable. We take the oil, you know,
[02:07:28.640 --> 02:07:33.920]  with little blood balls. And so the fact that they're now rolling out the next phase is incredible.
[02:07:33.920 --> 02:07:40.240]  Here's that clip. It's not about the heartbeat. It's about the mama. It's about the mother's
[02:07:40.240 --> 02:07:45.760]  choice. So when do we cut off abortions at what week? I think at three years old is when we should.
[02:07:46.320 --> 02:07:50.240]  You think at three years old is when we should stop aborting children? Yeah.
[02:07:51.840 --> 02:07:54.400]  Okay, convince me of that. Give me an argument for that.
[02:07:57.120 --> 02:08:05.840]  I need a moment. This is too much. You know, a lot of countries have a lot different views on
[02:08:05.840 --> 02:08:14.160]  life and when life begins. When does life begin for you? I don't know. Are we even really alive?
[02:08:15.360 --> 02:08:20.880]  So you said that up to three years old. Convince me of that. What is your premise for saying that
[02:08:20.880 --> 02:08:26.000]  we can kill babies, children, toddlers until they're three? What happens at three years old
[02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:32.640]  to where we can't abort them anymore? They start talking a lot. And like,
[02:08:32.640 --> 02:08:36.960]  then why are you trying to touch me? So this is almost the 57th time I've been touched without my
[02:08:36.960 --> 02:08:40.800]  consent. It's not you. It's the microphone. It's the microphone. Don't touch my property.
[02:08:40.800 --> 02:08:44.320]  You guys see, this is what's funny. You guys don't respect property rights. If you guys
[02:08:44.320 --> 02:08:48.720]  respected property rights in life, you wouldn't act like this. You wouldn't try to grab it.
[02:08:48.720 --> 02:08:54.400]  So she is like staring hardcore at this info wars logo. I am convinced that this logo is some type
[02:08:54.400 --> 02:08:59.760]  of like QR code to these robots, these NPCs out here. And it's all like triggering their head.
[02:08:59.760 --> 02:09:04.560]  They see this, you know, like when a QR code gets on the phone, it's like wiring their brain
[02:09:04.560 --> 02:09:10.800]  weird in their program and they just act crazy because it's pro human. So if you're a radio
[02:09:10.800 --> 02:09:16.640]  listener, you've been spared singer, totally green skin, translucent, white skin, zombie-like,
[02:09:17.280 --> 02:09:25.120]  hateful, obsessed with killing babies. When is life even begin? That's how a demon talks. You
[02:09:25.120 --> 02:09:32.080]  say, I want to defend life. There is no life. There is only death. And you don't know till
[02:09:32.080 --> 02:09:38.720]  you engage them. This is the average operating system, a soulless, shriveled woman who hates men.
[02:09:39.840 --> 02:09:47.440]  But she goes, the mama decide the death. Mama's kill, baby. Mama kill, Kali.
[02:09:48.480 --> 02:09:52.320]  But Alex, let's actually break this down because in that tiny little clip,
[02:09:52.320 --> 02:09:57.760]  there's so much to learn. First of all, she says, are we even alive? So she's right there telling
[02:09:57.760 --> 02:10:02.560]  you she's spiritually dead. I mean, that's it, right there. She's gone. The devil has won her
[02:10:02.560 --> 02:10:06.800]  soul. And they all have that look. It's like looking through her, I'm going to get you.
[02:10:07.600 --> 02:10:12.240]  And then the, the Caitlyn made the point about the infor's my flat being like a QR code again.
[02:10:12.240 --> 02:10:16.640]  She didn't even realize how right she is, but it's spiritual. It's not digital. It's not three
[02:10:16.640 --> 02:10:21.520]  dimensional. It's spiritual. It's what we do here that they hate. And then here's the other level
[02:10:21.520 --> 02:10:26.880]  too. That poor girl, girl, you know, she's young. Maybe there's hope for her, but what is really
[02:10:26.880 --> 02:10:31.040]  driving? She was slowly seduced into this, but she, yeah, but you notice what she does. She
[02:10:31.040 --> 02:10:35.680]  uses the brainwashing terms. Elizabeth Warren does it all the time. Mama, it's about the mama.
[02:10:37.040 --> 02:10:43.040]  These mama takes care of the baby. The mama don't kill the baby. The truth is, Alex, these women
[02:10:43.040 --> 02:10:48.320]  just hate men for whatever reason. Maybe they've been treated badly by a man. Maybe it's the
[02:10:48.320 --> 02:10:52.640]  propaganda in the media that says men are bad that they hate men, or maybe they genuinely
[02:10:52.640 --> 02:10:57.440]  think men are out to control their bodies with abortion. I choose to stand for pro life because
[02:10:57.440 --> 02:11:02.560]  it's an easy win. I mean, how do you not stand for innocent babies? How do you not stand for
[02:11:02.560 --> 02:11:07.200]  not murdering babies? I mean, that's like the easiest when you can take, but the whole thing is
[02:11:08.080 --> 02:11:12.080]  dates. It's all, it's, it's amazing. It's all in that one. They're so spiritually blind. They're
[02:11:12.080 --> 02:11:18.000]  whole cult. Let's play it. We're going to Dan Lyman. Here it is. And they're all like this. I mean,
[02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:23.600]  we've got hours of footage. I kill babies. I love Satan. You think they're trying to shock you? No,
[02:11:24.240 --> 02:11:28.800]  three years. That's Peter Singer. That's the plan. Now they've already got five states past laws.
[02:11:30.400 --> 02:11:37.040]  If the doctor say we don't get government involved, the mama who's drugged up and the dad and daddy
[02:11:37.040 --> 02:11:42.960]  ain't bothered, but we're going to get the little chitlin out of the baby gut. So they've already
[02:11:42.960 --> 02:11:49.280]  gotten there. It's all about we want to kill and we want to kill. It's the mama going to do it.
[02:11:49.280 --> 02:11:56.720]  Once the kids start talking a lot, maybe we don't kill them now. Look how sick she is,
[02:11:57.280 --> 02:12:00.800]  but she's all high. Only time she shows the energy, she starts about killing babies. She's like,
[02:12:00.800 --> 02:12:07.360]  yeah, hey, they start talking and maybe we don't then. But once they get you to accept of days
[02:12:07.360 --> 02:12:11.520]  three, they'll get them after that. They're dimensional gates open, give me their blood.
[02:12:15.840 --> 02:12:19.200]  It's like they're trying to come through. And that's the thing is you don't believe in demons
[02:12:19.200 --> 02:12:23.360]  till you're around them. They're like, what's going on? Your children are ours. Your planet's
[02:12:23.360 --> 02:12:28.240]  ours. I can tell you how many footage I see of mentally ill people and schizos that come after
[02:12:28.240 --> 02:12:31.920]  info wars. They'll be like, I just want to destroy your planet, destroy Alex Jones.
[02:12:35.200 --> 02:12:40.000]  What is this? Who are these people? I don't know because you don't want to kill babies
[02:12:40.640 --> 02:12:44.640]  because their whole plan is kill the planet. It's why they're the environmentalists.
[02:12:44.640 --> 02:12:49.760]  They're the guardians cut the carbon dioxide off. It's a trace gas. The planet dies without it.
[02:12:49.760 --> 02:12:55.040]  And then GMO, toxic waste dumping, everything's fine. So let's play this woman. There's a full 10
[02:12:55.040 --> 02:13:02.400]  minute clip of her. Here she is saying kill babies up to age three for mama. She even,
[02:13:02.400 --> 02:13:08.000]  the demon even uses the word mama kill baby mama. She's like your mother sucks cocks and
[02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:13.920]  hell, you know, to use the quote out of exorcist, sorry for the French, but that's what she says.
[02:13:13.920 --> 02:13:21.200]  She's like mama kill, mama kill, mama kill baby. That's what mother does is murder babies.
[02:13:21.200 --> 02:13:27.360]  Pure Satanism. You want to see pure Satanism? Here it is. So when do we cut off abortions
[02:13:27.360 --> 02:13:32.720]  at what week? I think at three years old is when we should. You think at three years old is when
[02:13:32.720 --> 02:13:39.200]  we should stop aborting children? Yeah. Okay, convince me of that. Give me an argument for that.
[02:13:41.840 --> 02:13:45.120]  I need a moment. This is too much.
[02:13:45.120 --> 02:13:53.680]  You know, a lot of countries have a lot different views on life and when life begins, when life
[02:13:53.680 --> 02:13:58.880]  begins. When does life begin for you? I don't know. Are we even really alive?
[02:14:00.080 --> 02:14:05.440]  So you said that up to three years old. Convince me of that. What is your premise for saying
[02:14:05.440 --> 02:14:10.720]  that we can kill babies, children, toddlers until they're three? What happens at three years old
[02:14:10.720 --> 02:14:16.720]  to where we can't abort them anymore? They start talking a lot. Shut them up.
[02:14:17.520 --> 02:14:21.520]  Why are you trying to touch me? So this is almost the 57th time I've been touched without
[02:14:21.520 --> 02:14:25.520]  my consent. It's not you. It's the microphone. It's the microphone. Don't touch my property.
[02:14:25.520 --> 02:14:29.040]  You guys, see, this is what's funny. You guys don't respect the property rights. If you guys
[02:14:29.040 --> 02:14:33.440]  respected property rights in life, you wouldn't act like this. You wouldn't try to grab it.
[02:14:33.440 --> 02:14:39.360]  So she is like staring hard for the Civil Wars logo. I'm curious about that. You go around them,
[02:14:39.360 --> 02:14:44.000]  they actually all go like, they don't all just have pale skin and dead eyes as a joke.
[02:14:46.080 --> 02:14:48.320]  Something's jacked in wrong and it wants your babies.
[02:14:50.160 --> 02:14:54.640]  That's it, Alex. I mean, you've caught it on film. They say kill the babies. They brag about
[02:14:54.640 --> 02:14:58.240]  their abortions. I've got it on film bragging about their abortions. It's like, look,
[02:14:58.240 --> 02:15:03.600]  you had an abortion. Okay. That's a sad thing. Why are you celebrating it? By the way, most
[02:15:03.600 --> 02:15:08.720]  these women are so ugly and mentally ill, they never had an abortion. They just want to convince
[02:15:08.720 --> 02:15:14.080]  women to kill your babies and let me be there and take you in help because I get power and the demon
[02:15:14.080 --> 02:15:24.560]  rewards me before they start talking. Kill those little bastards. God give me that baby's a boy.
[02:15:24.560 --> 02:15:29.920]  That baby boy is going to grow. Well, get that baby. Unless we can make that baby boy into a
[02:15:29.920 --> 02:15:36.080]  female, that's going to be a man. If we can chop his balls off, then baby, Satan would please us.
[02:15:36.080 --> 02:15:42.240]  We were not able to kill that little boy, give him vaccines and chop his balls off for Satan.
[02:15:43.840 --> 02:15:50.960]  We're the good people. We're the liberals. We'll be right back. How dare I say we shouldn't kill
[02:15:50.960 --> 02:15:57.840]  three-year-old children? It's not liberal. It's racist. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow,
[02:15:57.840 --> 02:16:03.920]  but soon you'll need a plan and place to survive. Forget bunkers. You're not a live underground

[02:20:13.680 --> 02:20:22.560]  I'm no stranger to the rain. I'm a friend of thunder. Friend, is it?
[02:20:22.560 --> 02:20:27.040]  All right. I appreciate Daniel. I'm in holding. He'll be with us for the hour while I was ranting.
[02:20:27.040 --> 02:20:32.720]  But I want to tell you something. The best thing I ever did
[02:20:35.200 --> 02:20:42.560]  was go out to Pro-Life for Alex 20 years ago, 20 plus years ago. I was guilty about paying for
[02:20:42.560 --> 02:20:47.840]  abortions. I didn't believe I'd killed my kids. I believe the propaganda. I don't judge people
[02:20:47.840 --> 02:20:52.560]  that have that abortion. God judges the heart. People ask, like, why the hell would you admit
[02:20:52.560 --> 02:20:58.800]  that on air? Because he without sin cast the first stone. But I repent for it. And I said,
[02:20:58.800 --> 02:21:03.760]  I'd never do that again. And I've got four children. They could tell me how to down syndrome child.
[02:21:04.720 --> 02:21:08.240]  I'm going to keep that child and love that child. I don't have a down syndrome child.
[02:21:08.240 --> 02:21:11.520]  I don't ask for that from God. I'm saying I would take care of that child.
[02:21:11.520 --> 02:21:13.280]  People say the most loving children you can imagine.
[02:21:15.520 --> 02:21:19.680]  But if you hadn't been out to a pro-abortion rally,
[02:21:22.880 --> 02:21:26.800]  I suggest you go to one. And I'm going to tell you something right now.
[02:21:28.240 --> 02:21:32.400]  There's a lot of anti-white talk out there, a lot of racism towards white people.
[02:21:33.760 --> 02:21:37.120]  And it's meant to create division in this country, in this world. And I think white
[02:21:37.120 --> 02:21:40.000]  people are good folks on average and have done a lot of good things and are
[02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:46.880]  contributing to society. But when you go out to one of these events, they're almost all white.
[02:21:49.440 --> 02:21:51.200]  And they're not just licking their lips when you're around.
[02:21:53.920 --> 02:21:58.080]  They love killing kids and they love the power of chopping them up and their demons.
[02:21:59.360 --> 02:22:00.480]  And they're almost all white.
[02:22:00.480 --> 02:22:09.040]  And I don't even know why I'm making that point.
[02:22:10.800 --> 02:22:17.040]  It's just that something's going on here and all I can do is scientifically observe what's
[02:22:17.040 --> 02:22:23.520]  happening. Because you just saw a woman, if you tuned in, and we've got dozens of these videos
[02:22:23.520 --> 02:22:27.520]  just at the event saying, oh, kill kids after they're born. Kill them any time. Kill old people.
[02:22:27.520 --> 02:22:32.080]  No case for killing granny. Cover a newsweek. And it's just kill everybody. And it's always these
[02:22:32.080 --> 02:22:38.960]  weak super white-skinned chicken-neck zombie-looking people telling you how much they want to kill
[02:22:38.960 --> 02:22:45.680]  kids. And they're always anti, and they're just a scourge. They're bad people. And they're tuned
[02:22:45.680 --> 02:22:51.120]  into something evil, folks. Because they don't have, I mean, these aren't the liberals of old.
[02:22:51.120 --> 02:22:56.960]  These are screwballs. And their sacrament is dead babies. Oh, and you're going to ride shotgun
[02:22:56.960 --> 02:23:01.600]  in the rest of the hour. I want to go to Dan Lyman at europewars.com. The incredible job he does,
[02:23:01.600 --> 02:23:05.520]  our main reporter in England, talking about the big victories against the globalists. But
[02:23:06.400 --> 02:23:12.080]  when you experience the radical Islam's evil that just loves death and the left's allied with it,
[02:23:12.080 --> 02:23:17.440]  and they act even possessed, it really is a spirit. It's a chomping at the bit. Let me ask
[02:23:17.440 --> 02:23:21.600]  Dan Lyman. We'll get into the elections next segment. But Dan, you live in Europe. You've
[02:23:21.600 --> 02:23:25.680]  been all over it. Before you even worked for us, you were a big reporter. You've covered
[02:23:25.680 --> 02:23:29.760]  deboss. You name it. This is a whole other subject you didn't know you were getting on involved. But
[02:23:29.760 --> 02:23:35.440]  we have all these videos of the average person at a pro-abortion rally now. Their operating system
[02:23:35.440 --> 02:23:39.120]  is Satanism. They have a new movie out called Hell Satan, where they admit the Democratic
[02:23:39.120 --> 02:23:43.680]  Party's new move is to get people to register in the Satanic Party. And it's their operating
[02:23:43.680 --> 02:23:48.640]  system. And some of them make it tongue-in-cheek, but they're converting to this. And you've got
[02:23:48.640 --> 02:23:53.200]  ISIS-eating hearts and putting women in sex slavery and children. It just really does come
[02:23:53.200 --> 02:23:57.200]  back to good versus evil in my view. And I don't think the average person who hasn't been on the
[02:23:57.200 --> 02:24:00.800]  front lines has witnessed this. You've been on the front lines. This isn't scripted. I don't know
[02:24:00.800 --> 02:24:04.240]  what you're going to say. I don't even know what your religious background is. So you're a great
[02:24:04.240 --> 02:24:09.040]  reporter, met you a few times in person, followed your work for many years before you worked for
[02:24:09.040 --> 02:24:13.680]  for us. But what do you add to this? Do you disagree with me that it's spiritual or have you ever
[02:24:13.680 --> 02:24:19.840]  seen this, these people, the way they act? 100 percent, Alex. I say with anyone that
[02:24:19.840 --> 02:24:25.600]  having a candid conversation with that politics is just the playing field. But the real war that's
[02:24:25.600 --> 02:24:30.000]  going on behind the scenes is spiritual. And at this point, I think that's clearer than ever,
[02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:34.720]  especially with this battle between globalists and nationalists. At this point, I think the
[02:24:34.720 --> 02:24:42.080]  nation state is in and of itself the force for good, the force that holds a society together.
[02:24:42.080 --> 02:24:47.040]  And this globalist agenda, there's nothing good about it. There's nothing well-intentioned about
[02:24:47.040 --> 02:24:52.640]  it. And it's not very popular as we're seeing now. And if they were just honest 100 percent about
[02:24:52.640 --> 02:24:57.440]  everything that they wanted for their movement and their agenda, it would be even less popular.
[02:24:57.440 --> 02:25:03.600]  But they have to rely on subversion and sabotage and lying in order to advance the football at
[02:25:03.600 --> 02:25:08.480]  all. But I think people are starting to see through that now. And this is definitely a battle
[02:25:08.480 --> 02:25:12.960]  between good and evil that is playing out on the political battlefield right now.
[02:25:12.960 --> 02:25:19.840]  So nationalism versus globalism is good versus evil. That's the headline for this segment and
[02:25:19.840 --> 02:25:25.920]  the next few. And you're going to have the floor when we come back. Oh, and it doesn't seem like
[02:25:25.920 --> 02:25:30.320]  it is. People are choosing sides. There is a polarization. Well, the Bible says that and
[02:25:30.320 --> 02:25:35.120]  common sense says it. You do want a polarization. Either your wife loves you or your husband loves
[02:25:35.120 --> 02:25:39.280]  you or either the company you work for cares about you or they don't. We need polarization.
[02:25:39.280 --> 02:25:44.720]  We need to make stuff black and white here. Damn it. Well, again, I didn't get into this
[02:25:44.720 --> 02:25:50.160]  to do spiritual things or to talk about God or anything like that. I got into this for political
[02:25:50.160 --> 02:25:53.040]  reasons. Oh, I mean, when you were out there with the most viral guy on the Internet three,
[02:25:53.040 --> 02:25:58.880]  four years ago, you were just covering other than free speech. And over time, you know,
[02:25:58.880 --> 02:26:03.600]  it's just been more and more of a spiritual battle to me. And there's so much other stuff that goes
[02:26:03.600 --> 02:26:07.680]  on too. I mean, you know, I meet the people at an event like yesterday, they talk about how they
[02:26:07.680 --> 02:26:11.840]  pray for us. I can't even tell. I can't even explain how much that fills my heart. Is it not
[02:26:11.840 --> 02:26:17.600]  humbling though? It gives me all the confidence I need. And you know, again, it's like, I don't
[02:26:17.600 --> 02:26:22.240]  know how to explain it. But when this happened yesterday, and people saw these flyers around
[02:26:22.240 --> 02:26:25.520]  town with my address on it, they were like, Are you scared? Like, you know, do you need
[02:26:25.520 --> 02:26:29.280]  hell? We're praying for you. And I'm like, look, your prayers is all I need. You know,
[02:26:29.280 --> 02:26:32.800]  I've got a second amendment here. And you know, hopefully I don't have to use it. But honestly,
[02:26:32.800 --> 02:26:37.120]  your prayers are more important than anything that I can do. Let me guess, I bet you're sleeping
[02:26:37.120 --> 02:26:46.400]  better than ever. I can't believe you just said that, Alex. Is it true? More than you actually
[02:26:46.400 --> 02:26:50.880]  realized probably. Oh, what's what's funny about no, I sleep better when I'm under attack.
[02:26:50.880 --> 02:26:57.280]  No, I actually have. I've actually throughout my life really last five years or so have have
[02:26:57.280 --> 02:27:03.360]  dealt with actually serious insomnia. I didn't know that. And after after this weekend, I slept
[02:27:03.360 --> 02:27:08.000]  for the first time actually, I'll just say it on air in seven days. See, because your spirit was
[02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:12.080]  restless. Now you're on your mission. You see how that works. The people that are people that are
[02:27:12.080 --> 02:27:15.200]  bad, I'm gonna say we're bad before you on your mission. They have trouble sleeping. You know,
[02:27:15.200 --> 02:27:19.600]  your mission, you'll sleep like a dead Pharaoh, my friend. And if the mission is foggy, you can't
[02:27:19.600 --> 02:27:24.640]  sleep at all. And I think that what it comes down to though, Alex, again, I didn't get in this for
[02:27:24.640 --> 02:27:29.280]  spiritual reasons. I got in this because I was more of an operative in the 3D world. I was a
[02:27:29.280 --> 02:27:33.840]  worldly person and I just saw the fake news and I saw where the country was going and I just wanted
[02:27:33.840 --> 02:27:38.480]  to have freedom for the future. But it becomes more and more spiritual every day. And it's just
[02:27:38.480 --> 02:27:44.320]  sad. I mean, I remember I met Dan in Cleveland at the RMC in 2016. We were walking around, man.
[02:27:44.320 --> 02:27:49.280]  We walked around in our Trump hats. The Trump the Trump protesters back then were just as hateful.
[02:27:49.280 --> 02:27:56.160]  Yeah. If you screw you, Nazi. And it's just like, man, I'm just out here because I like a guy for
[02:27:56.160 --> 02:28:01.360]  president. Like, what the heck did I do that's so bad? But then you realize it. It's a spiritual
[02:28:01.360 --> 02:28:05.680]  battle. Trump is being prayed for every day. Trump is bringing God back into the White House.
[02:28:05.680 --> 02:28:10.480]  Oh, there's no doubt Trump was anointed. There's no doubt in full horse was the enemy.
[02:28:10.480 --> 02:28:14.640]  We have the mark on us of God doesn't mean we're perfect. But we've been chosen.
[02:28:14.640 --> 02:28:19.760]  That's why they're so pissed, man. They see it. They're spiritually dead and they see it.
[02:28:20.720 --> 02:28:23.920]  We're going to go to break. Come back with Dan Lime and give him the floor. He's joined us.
[02:28:23.920 --> 02:28:29.200]  Amazing news on Europe. This is real, folks. It's about your soul. And you got to go out of
[02:28:29.200 --> 02:28:34.720]  these abortion rallies, man. It's not like 10% or 20% about half of them. You'll think, okay,
[02:28:34.720 --> 02:28:38.480]  they're doing this to shock me. And then all of a sudden, you'll get footage by one of your other
[02:28:38.480 --> 02:28:41.920]  camera folks that doesn't say they're with you. And they're like going, I just want to murder
[02:28:41.920 --> 02:28:47.840]  the babies. I hate children dirty self. Once they start talking, I hate the way babies talk.
[02:28:47.840 --> 02:28:53.040]  I want to cut them up. You heard her earlier. She's like, once they start running their dirty
[02:28:53.040 --> 02:29:00.000]  little nose. If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me. You don't
[02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:05.600]  know me and we'll never meet. I had a problem like you once I drank and used to party a little too
[02:29:05.600 --> 02:29:12.800]  much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life. I realized I needed help to fix my problem
[02:29:12.800 --> 02:29:18.480]  before it totally destroyed me. If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know

[02:30:55.920 --> 02:31:01.840]  It would take me more than an hour just to lay out all the admitted benefits and
[02:31:02.480 --> 02:31:07.680]  known positive effects of just one of the ingredients in our ultimate bone broth formula.
[02:31:07.680 --> 02:31:13.840]  Everybody knows about bone broth itself and all of the amazing things that it's associated with,
[02:31:13.840 --> 02:31:17.840]  and that it's been the big craze for at least a decade. Well, thousands of years ago, it's what
[02:31:17.840 --> 02:31:21.840]  everybody told people they should drink in a soup if they were sick. But then you add,

[02:31:51.120 --> 02:31:55.680]  to funding our operation that's taken on the globalists and fighting for all of our freedoms.
[02:31:55.680 --> 02:32:00.960]  The globalists are hyper competitive scientific dictators. They are technocrats.
[02:32:00.960 --> 02:32:05.280]  They are control freaks in their own words. And they believe allowing you to live your own life
[02:32:05.280 --> 02:32:10.560]  and make your own decisions gets to the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[02:32:10.560 --> 02:32:14.240]  Now, we're fighting them hard in cyberspace. We're fighting them hard right here in the third
[02:32:14.240 --> 02:32:18.880]  dimension. But one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot
[02:32:18.880 --> 02:32:23.760]  of control in our lives is our bodies. If I wasn't taking the highest-quality supplements
[02:32:23.760 --> 02:32:30.080]  for infowarslife.com, I couldn't do it. That's why we decided to take our original Secret 12 that
[02:32:30.080 --> 02:32:35.360]  was incredibly high quality Methylcobalamin and double the strength of it in a new formula,
[02:32:35.360 --> 02:32:41.600]  Ultra 12. Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest highest quality B12 over the counter that you're

[02:32:47.040 --> 02:32:53.280]  the second American Revolution against the tyrants at infowarsstore.com, infowarslife.com,
[02:32:53.280 --> 02:33:01.280]  or AAA-253-3139. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:33:01.280 --> 02:33:22.640]  Oh and Shroyer, Dan Landon, report. Crashing through the lies and disinformation. It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:22.640 --> 02:33:30.080]  That's right. Crashing through the lies and disinformation. Waging war on corruption.
[02:33:32.240 --> 02:33:37.920]  All right, going back to Dan Lyman. EuropeWars.com, only you, the viewers and listeners. The most
[02:33:37.920 --> 02:33:42.240]  hardcore promoters of freedom can carry that website forward with the incredible reportage
[02:33:42.240 --> 02:33:49.600]  he and others bring you there that he heads up. EuropeWars.com Salvini, the leader of Italy. Europe
[02:33:49.600 --> 02:33:56.640]  is tired of being a slave to the elites. Tell us about the amazing, I mean again, I don't know
[02:33:56.640 --> 02:34:02.160]  words describe how big these victories are for populism and nationalism despite the media blackouts,
[02:34:02.160 --> 02:34:08.080]  the censorship, the demonization. You're in the heart of Europe. Dan Lyman, EuropeWars.com,
[02:34:08.080 --> 02:34:14.080]  tell us what's happening with these elections. Stunning election results yesterday, of course.
[02:34:14.080 --> 02:34:19.600]  I want to take us actually off to the side here. Belgium held, they called it a super Sunday,
[02:34:19.600 --> 02:34:23.680]  I believe. It was three different elections, the regional elections, the federal elections,
[02:34:23.680 --> 02:34:28.480]  and the European elections. They held them all yesterday. And there's a party called the Flams
[02:34:28.480 --> 02:34:34.560]  Belong. And they are basically just a right-wing nationalist populist party. They're very anti-EU,
[02:34:34.560 --> 02:34:40.400]  very anti-mass migration. And they had a huge surge yesterday that no one was, of course,
[02:34:40.400 --> 02:34:45.440]  that all the analysts missed. And in addition to a party that's a little bit more conservative than
[02:34:45.440 --> 02:34:50.640]  them, a little bit, not quite as intense, but the National Flemish Alliance, I believe they're
[02:34:50.640 --> 02:34:56.560]  called NVA. And both of these parties did extremely well in the elections yesterday.
[02:34:56.560 --> 02:35:03.280]  And Flams Belong is spearheaded by a young man, Tom Van Grieken. I'd say he's in his early 30s.
[02:35:03.280 --> 02:35:08.240]  This guy is super promising. He's just as intelligent and hard-hitting as Salvini. And
[02:35:08.240 --> 02:35:11.760]  this guy's come out of nowhere in the last few years. And I want to take us back one year ago
[02:35:11.760 --> 02:35:16.400]  to an article we published at InfoWars Europe, when Jean-Claude Junker actually made a visit
[02:35:16.400 --> 02:35:22.960]  to the Flemish parliament in Belgium. And this guy, Tom Van Grieken, who leads the party,
[02:35:22.960 --> 02:35:29.040]  he directed comments literally to Junker's face on the floor. And he said, Mr. Junker,
[02:35:30.080 --> 02:35:34.800]  Nietzsche suggested, what doesn't destroy me makes me stronger. Well, the EU will not succeed in
[02:35:34.800 --> 02:35:40.160]  erasing the identity of the European nations. The resistance organizes and becomes stronger.
[02:35:40.160 --> 02:35:46.080]  We'll see you at the next European elections. And that was his shot across the bow a year ago,
[02:35:46.080 --> 02:35:52.400]  almost to the day. And I think that definitely came true and was accurate, as we saw by the...
[02:35:52.400 --> 02:35:59.280]  So let's quantify this. Literally five years ago, Eurosceptics won 2% of the parliament.
[02:35:59.280 --> 02:36:05.840]  And now it's, what, over 30% growing exponentially. They are hitting the panic button. I want to play
[02:36:05.840 --> 02:36:12.800]  a clip of Junker, again, the unelected head of the EU, and the literal heir to the most powerful
[02:36:12.800 --> 02:36:19.040]  Nazi family after Hitler, who wasn't a family. He was the leader, the Fuhrer. But how were they
[02:36:19.040 --> 02:36:24.160]  going to strike back? Because you can see the tea leaves here. They admit that they're all going
[02:36:24.160 --> 02:36:29.600]  to be out of power coming next election even sooner. Yeah, that's what I've been thinking about,
[02:36:29.600 --> 02:36:35.760]  because this election result is so damaging, so punishing, that I would imagine the empire will
[02:36:35.760 --> 02:36:40.160]  strike back and they will strike back hard, probably in the form of censorship. And they'll
[02:36:40.160 --> 02:36:45.840]  probably crank up the media attacks on anyone that's basically to the right of center. The way
[02:36:45.840 --> 02:36:49.600]  all of these articles are reading today, everybody's far right. People are going to be totally
[02:36:49.600 --> 02:36:54.960]  desensitized to that term at this point when Nigel Farage is far right. I mean, it's just crazy.
[02:36:54.960 --> 02:36:58.720]  Well, I was about to say the Streisand effect or beyond that the rebel effect.
[02:37:00.080 --> 02:37:04.480]  I don't think they get when Junker says how dare people love their country. They're stupid.
[02:37:04.480 --> 02:37:08.400]  And then he openly says, let me bring in a bunch of foreigners. They hate our country. And as
[02:37:08.400 --> 02:37:12.880]  events with standing armies marching in, don't they get that's going to backfire? They're not
[02:37:13.600 --> 02:37:16.480]  running operations against people 20 years ago that we're in a coma.
[02:37:16.480 --> 02:37:21.840]  Well, some of these people are just so far out there like Junker, for instance, I mean, the guy
[02:37:21.840 --> 02:37:27.920]  is bombed half the time. He's a drunkard and he just says things off the cuff that you just say,
[02:37:27.920 --> 02:37:31.920]  how does this guy get away with this? And he's on his way out. He won't be around much longer.
[02:37:32.800 --> 02:37:38.320]  But then they have people like Angela Merkel who are angling for to take positions in the EU at the
[02:37:38.320 --> 02:37:42.400]  Superstate level. Exactly. They get kicked out of their own governments with these elections. So
[02:37:42.400 --> 02:37:46.800]  now they moved to the unelected Superstate, which again started as a so-called trade deal. Here's
[02:37:46.800 --> 02:37:52.240]  Junker, who again comes from German royalty, Austrian, Hungarian Empire royalty. They were the
[02:37:52.240 --> 02:37:59.280]  most rich, powerful family in Germany in World War Two. His father was in the top command of the
[02:37:59.280 --> 02:38:07.280]  Nazis, his grandfather, his father was a in the war, a Nazi. But of course, part of the rat line,
[02:38:07.280 --> 02:38:13.280]  they were protected. So this is a literal Nazi running the EU project of the EU. Here he is.
[02:38:14.160 --> 02:38:21.200]  These populist nationalists, stupid nationalists, they are in love with the old country and they
[02:38:21.200 --> 02:38:28.880]  don't like the others. In some countries of the European Union, the government, the parliament,
[02:38:29.680 --> 02:38:35.760]  a major part of the society don't like those coming from far away.
[02:38:35.760 --> 02:38:38.960]  Okay, so he goes, we like them. So let's stop there. I've already played this five times today,
[02:38:38.960 --> 02:38:44.320]  so I'm not going to play the whole clip. There's not even translation here. The people, the
[02:38:44.320 --> 02:38:49.360]  parliament, they don't like the people far away. Yeah, when 80% are military aged men,
[02:38:49.360 --> 02:38:52.800]  when they're brought in North Africa, Middle East, where they're raping and killing,
[02:38:52.800 --> 02:39:00.080]  where the tourism is down 80%. And then you sit there and you say that people are bad and stupid,
[02:39:00.080 --> 02:39:06.640]  because they don't want to export North Africa to Paris or to Frankfurt. I mean, as you said,
[02:39:06.640 --> 02:39:11.200]  there's plenty of him falling down drunk out of his mind. But he basically is the richest guy in
[02:39:11.200 --> 02:39:14.560]  Europe, probably the richest man in the world. Some estimate, sorry, he's richer than the Rothschild.
[02:39:14.560 --> 02:39:20.960]  I mean, this guy's worth a trillion. Yeah, folks, it's not Bill Gates. So maybe he's not arrogant.
[02:39:20.960 --> 02:39:26.640]  Maybe you know something we don't know, Dan Lyman. That's certainly possible. But when you hear
[02:39:26.640 --> 02:39:31.120]  the way he's talking, and it kind of reminds me of the way that Pelosi sounds at times,
[02:39:31.120 --> 02:39:34.960]  it's like that friend who's had way too much to drink. And then they're just saying like the
[02:39:34.960 --> 02:39:38.640]  craziest stuff off the top of their head. They might not even mean it. They might mean it,
[02:39:38.640 --> 02:39:43.280]  but they're just laying it out on the table. And by the way, I'm not saying that that that
[02:39:43.280 --> 02:39:47.360]  Rudolf Slingani was helping Pelosi, Trump's chief legal advisor. I don't think that's the case.
[02:39:48.960 --> 02:39:52.160]  He's got his problems, but he's I think he's pro-Trump, pro-America at this point.
[02:39:52.160 --> 02:39:56.640]  He sees where the tea leaves are going. But for him to put out her at half speed,
[02:39:56.640 --> 02:40:01.840]  exactly. We have hours of her bumbling, doesn't know who she is. Why would you put out a slowed
[02:40:01.840 --> 02:40:08.240]  down audio when you've got all the damn proof? Yeah, poor decision. I mean, we've got to be
[02:40:08.240 --> 02:40:13.760]  careful. There's no need for missteps, especially something that's that obvious. So yeah, can't
[02:40:13.760 --> 02:40:18.080]  say I support that one at all. We can stick to putting out accurate, correct. But you know why
[02:40:18.080 --> 02:40:22.960]  it happened? Because sometimes she sounds just like that. People thought it was real. He didn't
[02:40:22.960 --> 02:40:26.720]  put that out there. You know, it's fake. She already sounds so brain damaged. That's why it happened.
[02:40:28.080 --> 02:40:32.240]  Right. It's kind of like that AOC parody account that was taken down. People were kind of worried
[02:40:32.800 --> 02:40:36.640]  that it was starting to sound just like her own account. It was hard to tell the difference. So
[02:40:36.640 --> 02:40:40.720]  yeah, these people are just off their rockers. And I kind of want to tie that in actually to what
[02:40:40.720 --> 02:40:46.160]  happened in the elections yesterday in Germany. What we have here in Europe, I think, is two forms
[02:40:46.160 --> 02:40:51.920]  of populism. We have a radical left wing populism, which is a very environmentally based climate change
[02:40:51.920 --> 02:40:58.160]  agenda. And that's where a lot of voters went in Germany. Yeah, that's Soros astroturf. They
[02:40:58.160 --> 02:41:02.160]  realize everybody's leaving the establishment globalist EU things. So they've created new
[02:41:02.160 --> 02:41:08.400]  leftist astroturf just like AOC here. That's exactly what I was going to say. They're collecting
[02:41:08.400 --> 02:41:12.960]  these people who have become disenfranchised with the establishment and they're hurting a lot of
[02:41:12.960 --> 02:41:17.440]  them over into this other movement where they have, it's basically based on climate change. I
[02:41:17.440 --> 02:41:23.040]  mean, they had all these crazy rallies in Switzerland and Germany on Friday, right before the election,
[02:41:23.040 --> 02:41:27.600]  all the students out marching. They're all rallying around this Swedish girl Greta Thunberg.
[02:41:27.600 --> 02:41:33.040]  And they've made her the new profit of the movement. But that's where a lot of the German
[02:41:33.040 --> 02:41:38.240]  voters went in the election here. The Greens did very well. I believe they placed in second.
[02:41:38.240 --> 02:41:44.000]  And the AFD did not do so well. They only did well really in the East German side,
[02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:50.800]  which was formerly communist, which is interesting. It really highlights that divide between
[02:41:50.800 --> 02:41:57.440]  the formerly communist states like Hungary and Poland and the Czech and then East Germany,
[02:41:57.440 --> 02:42:03.120]  of course, and how they're responding to the establishment as opposed to Western Europe,
[02:42:03.120 --> 02:42:07.680]  where a lot of them are going to this even harder left, crazy environment. An enlightenment of
[02:42:07.680 --> 02:42:10.960]  EuropeWars.com. That's fascinating. I noticed that. I'm glad you raised that. That's one of the
[02:42:10.960 --> 02:42:16.080]  questions I wanted to raise. But luckily, you're a step ahead of me. You see Eastern Europe that's
[02:42:16.080 --> 02:42:21.440]  been under tyranny, been under communism, been under Islamic invasion, super nationalist,
[02:42:22.080 --> 02:42:29.680]  George Washington 2.0, Donald Trump, beyond Donald Trump, M4S, and now even East Germany gets it
[02:42:29.680 --> 02:42:35.040]  because they've seen this animal before. They know what a scam and tyranny looks like. We'll
[02:42:35.040 --> 02:42:40.880]  get into more facets of this historic victory for populism and nationalism with Dan Lyman,
[02:42:40.880 --> 02:42:46.400]  Owen Troyer and more. Then Tom Papert's coming up and I've got new chai-com treason news I'll be
[02:42:46.400 --> 02:42:50.880]  covering as well. Yeah, I was supposed to take off today. I was supposed to take my family on a

[02:47:04.380 --> 02:47:13.720]  Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Ho!
[02:47:13.720 --> 02:47:39.260]  Alright folks, I don't want to get hysterical here, but I do, Alex Jones back live.
[02:47:39.260 --> 02:47:45.400]  The globalists want to have us have learned helplessness or a term I've coined mass Stockholm
[02:47:45.400 --> 02:47:46.400]  syndrome.
[02:47:46.400 --> 02:47:58.120]  I've got a stack and when I say a stack of news every one of these articles I either
[02:47:58.120 --> 02:48:04.900]  read or scanned over and that stuff each one of these we can talk for an hour on each
[02:48:04.900 --> 02:48:13.700]  one of these is so bombshell and a good 15 articles in this stat is the governor of New
[02:48:13.700 --> 02:48:22.560]  Mexico a libtard saying we don't want any borders.
[02:48:22.560 --> 02:48:28.940]  So the board patrol cut back there and now it's overrun everywhere because she wouldn't
[02:48:28.940 --> 02:48:32.780]  sit in the National Guard wouldn't sit in the National Guard and there are tent cities
[02:48:32.780 --> 02:48:42.500]  everywhere leprosy bubonic plague, drug resistant TB, areas of New Mexico are collapsing sort
[02:48:42.500 --> 02:48:44.580]  of been happening in Texas.
[02:48:44.580 --> 02:48:48.500]  Texas is spending billions of its own money every year just to try to get treatment because
[02:48:48.500 --> 02:48:53.460]  the board patrol is overwhelmed they can't even test somebody for diseases.
[02:48:53.460 --> 02:48:58.920]  Here are some of the headlines New Mexico Democratic governor pulled trips from border charade
[02:48:58.920 --> 02:49:05.740]  now she's demanding federal help over border crisis and then it talks about the board patrol
[02:49:05.740 --> 02:49:10.580]  is getting sick it's over a hundred thousand that they're catching hundreds of thousands
[02:49:10.580 --> 02:49:16.820]  more make it through and I was talking just this morning to a federal law enforcement
[02:49:16.820 --> 02:49:21.620]  officer in New Mexico and it's strange synergy because an hour after I talked to him I got
[02:49:21.620 --> 02:49:26.540]  a call from Mike Adams another source saying hell I'll show you Mike's text it wasn't a
[02:49:26.540 --> 02:49:33.860]  secret text saying law enforcement source I mean it's in the news it's not like it's
[02:49:33.860 --> 02:49:40.980]  not like you know this is even some secret got a source in Albuquerque on the street
[02:49:40.980 --> 02:49:45.980]  state police everywhere illegals are running rampant setting up tents in people's yards
[02:49:45.980 --> 02:49:50.300]  police telling citizens it's an invasion totally out of control police threatening to arrest
[02:49:50.300 --> 02:49:55.540]  anyone filming yeah.
[02:49:55.540 --> 02:50:01.260]  And then Ann Coulter who I've had Ann on over the years I don't think she's a bad person
[02:50:01.260 --> 02:50:05.020]  but it's an easy score to go.
[02:50:05.020 --> 02:50:10.140]  We've got over double the illegals coming in that we had under Obama because the UN ran
[02:50:10.140 --> 02:50:16.340]  the total invasion once Trump got in and admitted they were doing it US aid that Trump's tried
[02:50:16.340 --> 02:50:20.180]  to cut off through the State Department gives a thousand dollars every person with a debit
[02:50:20.180 --> 02:50:25.460]  card to come in Trump tried to get 12 billion he got a billion three Trump's trying to
[02:50:25.460 --> 02:50:30.140]  declare a national emergency judges are trying to block him so I'm not here to defend Trump
[02:50:30.140 --> 02:50:39.340]  I'm here to defend the truth and Owen and Dan I look at this people don't get 15 million
[02:50:39.340 --> 02:50:44.220]  illegals conservatively now they've been firing the heads of major police departments what
[02:50:44.220 --> 02:50:48.380]  federally in Sweden because they were covering up the number it wasn't two million illegals
[02:50:48.380 --> 02:50:53.780]  in Sweden it was five million the number is probably 30 million in Europe they tell us
[02:50:53.780 --> 02:50:58.700]  there's 20 million illegals there's probably 50 million here and again there's no infrastructure
[02:50:58.700 --> 02:51:03.380]  we're already collapsing we're going bankrupt the system set up have your babies free get
[02:51:03.380 --> 02:51:11.220]  free welfare the Democrats sign them up give them drivers license they're voting my God
[02:51:11.220 --> 02:51:16.300]  it's an invasion it's a takeover I don't even dislike the illegals they're fleeing tyranny
[02:51:16.300 --> 02:51:21.820]  I get it but we are like a lifeboat that holds 100 people that's already got 200 in it and
[02:51:21.820 --> 02:51:27.340]  the waters up to the sides and we're about to go under and the Democrats tried to say
[02:51:27.340 --> 02:51:32.740]  just six months ago remember six months ago there are no illegals there are no caravans
[02:51:32.740 --> 02:51:39.260]  it's a made up crisis now they say it's Trump's crisis in global warming get it and AOC is
[02:51:39.260 --> 02:51:46.620]  running around saying cauliflower is colonialism a community gardens in New York number one
[02:51:46.620 --> 02:51:51.340]  cauliflower I did deep research probably comes out of Africa it was all over the Middle East
[02:51:51.340 --> 02:51:57.860]  thousands of years ago it was named by Arabs who were in Cyprus 1300 years ago but imagine
[02:51:57.860 --> 02:52:02.540]  saying because it's white it's white people cauliflower grows in New York you can grow
[02:52:02.540 --> 02:52:05.900]  whatever you wanted a community garden you get your plot you do it I've done a community
[02:52:05.900 --> 02:52:11.180]  garden here in Austin with my kids when they were little that's the mental illness she
[02:52:11.180 --> 02:52:17.340]  goes out and says white people are growing cauliflower we've got to stop it and you think
[02:52:17.340 --> 02:52:26.940]  well that's crazy it's meant to be crazy my god oh and Troyer Dan Lyman what we see in
[02:52:26.940 --> 02:52:32.020]  Europe is five years ahead of us in my view what we see happening here Trump is set to
[02:52:32.020 --> 02:52:36.820]  declare a full on national emergency he's got to do it soon what do you think Owen well
[02:52:36.820 --> 02:52:40.220]  I just want to say you know Alex I've been working with you and listening to you and
[02:52:40.220 --> 02:52:43.620]  knowing you long enough that sometimes you say things that people think is outrageous
[02:52:43.620 --> 02:52:50.300]  not possibly true you remove the makeup from Alexandra Ocasio Cortez you may have a method
[02:52:50.300 --> 02:52:54.700]  but I'm just going to leave that right there you know Alex something that I I'm continued
[02:52:54.700 --> 02:52:59.060]  to be reminded by but but is really more hitting home now as we're really getting into the
[02:52:59.060 --> 02:53:06.540]  trenches for 2020 President Donald Trump is against an entire infrastructure of corruption
[02:53:06.540 --> 02:53:11.700]  the CIA was against him the FBI was against him the NSA was against him the president
[02:53:11.700 --> 02:53:16.380]  of the United States was against him he's still battling the courts every day the media
[02:53:16.380 --> 02:53:21.020]  is against him the worldwide media is against him the worldwide elite are against him the
[02:53:21.020 --> 02:53:25.940]  elite in the US are against him we are the school system is against him we are talking
[02:53:25.940 --> 02:53:30.940]  about an entire infrastructure of corruption built up in this country for decades that one
[02:53:30.940 --> 02:53:35.620]  man is currently trying to take on his present now that's why he needs our back that's why
[02:53:35.620 --> 02:53:40.900]  yes we'll call it like it is if Trump goes sideways we'll say it but man one man against
[02:53:40.900 --> 02:53:45.780]  an entire infrastructure of corruption he can't even get a damn border wall he can't
[02:53:45.780 --> 02:53:52.500]  even get a question on the census that says are you a US citizen why because it's an entire
[02:53:52.500 --> 02:53:59.100]  infrastructure of corruption so like you said at the beginning hopefully this is the beachhead
[02:53:59.100 --> 02:54:03.100]  and we just start to pour more people in so here's an example look back to Dan Lyman
[02:54:03.100 --> 02:54:08.860]  and hold him over to with Papert we're all going to host together here unless Lyman's
[02:54:08.860 --> 02:54:15.580]  got to go and I guess later in Europe let's think about this here's an example Trump ordered
[02:54:15.580 --> 02:54:20.180]  Brennan to lose his national security clearance a month and a half two months ago and so the
[02:54:20.180 --> 02:54:26.460]  news all Trump's powerless the bureaucracy didn't follow his order that's what happens
[02:54:26.460 --> 02:54:32.460]  at the White House and they lie to his face and then they don't execute it's called sabotage
[02:54:32.460 --> 02:54:37.820]  it's called treason Dan Lyman the parallels of Europe what's the real number of Islamic
[02:54:37.820 --> 02:54:43.780]  invaders how bad is it going to get what's happening next I was scared to think what
[02:54:43.780 --> 02:54:47.820]  the real numbers are because you know we see what's going on at our own southern border
[02:54:47.820 --> 02:54:53.700]  that's one single border that's being basically maintained by one government and and they
[02:54:53.700 --> 02:54:58.020]  don't have any idea how many people are coming across I've seen I think it was a lieutenant
[02:54:58.020 --> 02:55:02.980]  governor of Texas said that for every one that is caught there are two to three more
[02:55:02.980 --> 02:55:08.060]  that aren't caught so just put that into perspective when you have one land border being manned
[02:55:08.060 --> 02:55:13.140]  by one government and compare that against an entire continent being manned by all these
[02:55:13.140 --> 02:55:18.660]  different governments people flooding in from all different sides coming by sea by land
[02:55:18.660 --> 02:55:24.180]  by air so I mean the numbers I would imagine they're just staggering if we knew exactly
[02:55:24.180 --> 02:55:29.100]  what they were what they actually were and and we know that the governments are all working
[02:55:29.100 --> 02:55:34.700]  overtime to hide all accuracy about numbers whether it's who's coming in what crimes are
[02:55:34.700 --> 02:55:39.180]  committing how many crimes are committing how much it's costing all of us all those numbers
[02:55:39.180 --> 02:55:42.780]  are being off you up to skated and unfortunately they're being caught in the act that just
[02:55:42.780 --> 02:55:47.300]  happened in the Netherlands last week a huge scandal with the justice minister there was
[02:55:47.300 --> 02:55:52.540]  caught hiding the details about what crimes migrants are committing and how many so we
[02:55:52.540 --> 02:55:58.380]  are starting to uncover the truths but the actual truth of what's really going on is
[02:55:58.380 --> 02:56:05.340]  probably terrifying well I want to be clear your racist if you like cauliflower your racist
[02:56:05.340 --> 02:56:09.340]  if you don't want to abort black babies most black folks are hardworking great people but
[02:56:09.340 --> 02:56:13.380]  I grew up in Dallas in the 80s and there were a lot of racist black people that would attack
[02:56:13.380 --> 02:56:17.460]  you if you were white a lot of black friends but they would say yeah a lot of racist black
[02:56:17.460 --> 02:56:20.820]  people I had black friends that said yeah you better not go to my neighborhood and pick
[02:56:20.820 --> 02:56:26.700]  me up you know my neighbor says he might shoot you I mean they'd say get out of here whitey
[02:56:26.700 --> 02:56:30.940]  but I'm like Martin Luther King whether you love him or hate him I believe you judge people
[02:56:30.940 --> 02:56:36.300]  by what they stand for who they are but I know a lot of Austin police and I've experienced
[02:56:36.300 --> 02:56:40.860]  it there are a lot of incredible restaurants downtown a lot of great restaurants in East
[02:56:40.860 --> 02:56:50.140]  Austin but a couple years ago I stopped going to him because repeatedly I had black guys
[02:56:50.140 --> 02:56:55.300]  come get around me and say you better give us money or something bad is going to happen
[02:56:55.300 --> 02:57:00.500]  and I weighed 250 pounds and you know I'm not the toughest guy around but I don't look
[02:57:00.500 --> 02:57:06.780]  like a pushover and I literally had to say no and stand my ground and I talked to cops
[02:57:06.780 --> 02:57:09.940]  they said no it's horrible and I told people I know being mugged and it sort of come out
[02:57:09.940 --> 02:57:16.460]  in the news they tried to cover it up that it's open season on white people in Austin
[02:57:16.460 --> 02:57:22.860]  in these areas and the media again tries to cover it up some of it's come out now and
[02:57:22.860 --> 02:57:29.260]  it's just so sad the left is created an atmosphere where hunting white people is open season
[02:57:29.260 --> 02:57:34.420]  and then Jesse Smollett makes it up I want to finish up with Dan Lyman of Europewars.com
[02:57:34.420 --> 02:57:39.100]  now when Shroyer will continue with Tom Papert I haven't even begun believe me I'm way behind

[02:59:02.460 --> 02:59:03.460]  The bone broth.
[02:59:03.460 --> 02:59:04.460]  The bone broth.
[02:59:04.460 --> 02:59:05.460]  The bone.
[02:59:05.460 --> 02:59:10.980]  It tastes like it tastes like a great milkshake you know if you just add it to milk it tastes
[02:59:10.980 --> 02:59:16.700]  like oval theme it tastes like oval theme it tastes like oval theme like good whoa.
[02:59:16.700 --> 02:59:21.340]  I feel great since I've been taking it my daughter uses the bubblegum fluoride free
[02:59:21.340 --> 02:59:27.380]  toothpaste I've used the supermail vitality a host of other products so thank you so much

[02:59:40.140 --> 02:59:49.540]  I feel great since I've been taking it thank you.
[02:59:49.540 --> 03:00:15.700]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:00:15.700 --> 03:00:19.500]  Waging war on corruption crashing the lies and disinformation.
[03:00:19.500 --> 03:00:30.220]  The lone star state I'm proud stands up against the globalist organically no we're not funded
[03:00:30.220 --> 03:00:38.860]  by any US government agency we're not created by some shadowy group we're funded by viewers
[03:00:38.860 --> 03:00:43.540]  and listeners just like you just like you know you're for real and you love God and
[03:00:43.540 --> 03:00:49.420]  country and love freedom so do we and that's why the enemy always says we're fake we're
[03:00:49.420 --> 03:00:54.780]  run by something else so we're told what to do and that's why I've really intellectually
[03:00:54.780 --> 03:00:57.900]  thought about it we finish up with Dan Lyman and the great job he's doing at Europe Wars
[03:00:57.900 --> 03:01:05.780]  dot com to stop holding back about the influence of info wars because the enemy knows this
[03:01:05.780 --> 03:01:11.220]  and the enemies aware of it they're aware of what you're doing you really are the power
[03:01:11.220 --> 03:01:18.340]  of this organization they are who you fear come with establishment the listeners are
[03:01:18.340 --> 03:01:28.460]  who the establishment fears and so we don't take the orders we give the orders I'm gonna
[03:01:28.460 --> 03:01:32.580]  briefly talk about that the start of the next segment that's not bragging I've really had
[03:01:32.580 --> 03:01:37.340]  to analyze why they're after so bad and I knew we were contributing a lot to the course
[03:01:37.340 --> 03:01:53.820]  of things but it's it's it's very sacred the position we're in because what I talk about
[03:01:53.820 --> 03:02:01.380]  what we put out here is obviously looked into but it's taken immediately as the truth because
[03:02:01.380 --> 03:02:04.820]  even if we're wrong smart people understand the intent is good and that there's gonna
[03:02:04.820 --> 03:02:10.460]  be truth in it that's a very powerful position to be in and I don't seek power you don't
[03:02:10.460 --> 03:02:14.860]  seek power as an audience believe me we have it and the enemy wants to take it from us
[03:02:14.860 --> 03:02:18.500]  so they can have power over us we weren't looking for power because we were already born with
[03:02:18.500 --> 03:02:23.780]  it we have the birthright if you tune into liberty if you love freedom if you love God
[03:02:23.780 --> 03:02:29.380]  if you love justice you've got the birthright you can be Hispanic black old young white
[03:02:29.380 --> 03:02:35.340]  if you love God and justice God's seal is on your heart and this really is about what
[03:02:35.340 --> 03:02:40.860]  team you're on who you resonate with Dan Lyman incredible job at EuropeWars.com and we just
[03:02:40.860 --> 03:02:44.500]  can't say enough about the great work you do what else should you impart to the viewers
[03:02:44.500 --> 03:02:49.340]  out there across the world well I think that this is such an interesting time is a pivotal
[03:02:49.340 --> 03:02:55.140]  moment and and we have some real clear evidence that the tide is turning after yesterday and
[03:02:55.140 --> 03:02:59.020]  I think that we're gonna start seeing some really interesting things happen at the national
[03:02:59.020 --> 03:03:04.660]  government levels now that you know the lines the dividing lines have been drawn we have
[03:03:04.660 --> 03:03:09.620]  people like Merkel and Macron and May they're all wounded they're all going down they're
[03:03:09.620 --> 03:03:16.300]  on their way out the door and we have people like Salvini Farage and and Le Pen all on
[03:03:16.300 --> 03:03:21.660]  the ascendancy so things that we start here at this this globalist level deal them a really
[03:03:21.660 --> 03:03:28.460]  brutal blow yesterday and now turn it into an effective transition moment into the at
[03:03:28.460 --> 03:03:34.220]  the national level so that we can really start peeling apart this this super state so to speak
[03:03:34.220 --> 03:03:39.820]  and they can get leadership in these countries that can navigate these countries back to
[03:03:39.820 --> 03:03:44.420]  a Europe of sovereign countries that can interact with each other and trade with each other
[03:03:44.420 --> 03:03:50.740]  and travel between them just as efficiently as I did long before the EU but without this
[03:03:50.740 --> 03:03:58.260]  this international body over them ruining everything by my estimation using a football
[03:03:58.260 --> 03:04:04.460]  analogy NFL analogy not Europe's football correct me if I'm wrong just in closing I would say
[03:04:04.460 --> 03:04:12.180]  up until the last few minutes of the second quarter we were behind we just got two touchdowns
[03:04:12.180 --> 03:04:19.500]  the last five minutes we're going out of half time now with 14 points on the board but the
[03:04:19.500 --> 03:04:24.140]  enemy is going to pull everything out they've got we got two more quarters here perhaps over
[03:04:24.140 --> 03:04:29.700]  time I think we've we're on the offense we're winning but if people think that oh everything's
[03:04:29.700 --> 03:04:34.620]  okay we're going to lose absolutely we're going to be got to be prepared for all sorts
[03:04:34.620 --> 03:04:42.860]  of dirty trick plays on on their end and to just fight through all right Dan Lyman Europe

[03:06:21.700 --> 03:06:24.840]  as we're told the truth and beautiful music
[03:06:24.840 --> 03:06:27.400]  they're trying different things
[03:06:27.400 --> 03:06:29.920]  but they're trying different ways
[03:06:29.920 --> 03:06:32.180]  they're trying different things
[03:06:32.180 --> 03:06:41.500]  hide it
[03:06:41.500 --> 03:06:42.760]  I kid do you mind
[03:06:42.760 --> 03:06:52.420]  or lie to yourself and become a slave oh and shroyer beyond epic times beyond
[03:06:52.420 --> 03:06:57.240]  historic times imagine just ten years ago hearing that world government would
[03:06:57.240 --> 03:07:01.200]  be out in the open that everywhere there's an election they would lose we'd
[03:07:01.200 --> 03:07:07.120]  have a president stopping the Federal Reserve from jack knifing the economy
[03:07:07.120 --> 03:07:15.760]  or that we'd see all the evil bum rushing us in the final moments I have
[03:07:15.760 --> 03:07:19.320]  some big breaking news we're gonna bring Tom Pappert in here TV station
[03:07:19.320 --> 03:07:25.560]  manager owner patriot smart guy riding shotgun whether she'll take over here in
[03:07:25.560 --> 03:07:31.280]  a few segments completely but I'm not saying oh you're lucky I came in a
[03:07:31.280 --> 03:07:38.360]  memorial day I want to be here because veterans days about all veterans and is
[03:07:38.360 --> 03:07:44.780]  very important but Memorial Day is about people that died and you can say well
[03:07:44.780 --> 03:07:49.840]  some of these wars were lies and someone were frauds it doesn't matter the men and
[03:07:49.840 --> 03:07:53.600]  some of the women but the women that lost their men people that lost their
[03:07:53.600 --> 03:07:59.440]  fathers and brothers and the women as nurses that went down on ships
[03:07:59.440 --> 03:08:05.760]  torpedoes they believed in something great and they were willing to put it all
[03:08:05.760 --> 03:08:10.720]  on the line I think that's what's importantly on or now because in today's
[03:08:10.720 --> 03:08:14.200]  war we've got to be demonized and lied about and yeah they've put posters up
[03:08:14.200 --> 03:08:18.240]  where Owen lives and say come killing and so there's some danger but we don't
[03:08:18.240 --> 03:08:23.560]  let the danger define us we let the fact that we are victorious and we're
[03:08:23.560 --> 03:08:28.200]  standing up for the unborn standing up for sovereignty that defines us we're
[03:08:28.200 --> 03:08:34.720]  targets not victims just Tommy Robinson who barely lost in his run and when the
[03:08:34.720 --> 03:08:37.200]  numbers weren't coming in Saturday like they were supposed to I said I think
[03:08:37.200 --> 03:08:40.960]  they're gonna steal it from Tommy and I almost shot a special report but I did
[03:08:40.960 --> 03:08:45.560]  and I shot eight other reports saying Tommy Robinson I want to get his
[03:08:45.560 --> 03:08:51.760]  permission he was so busy you wouldn't answer Tommy Robinson wins European Union
[03:08:51.760 --> 03:08:57.560]  Parliament see I was to say even if he doesn't win he won by going out being
[03:08:57.560 --> 03:09:01.520]  attacked by mom speaking out going all over TV and radio circumventing the
[03:09:01.520 --> 03:09:06.520]  censorship and building a coalition and he did when you go out and take action
[03:09:06.520 --> 03:09:11.480]  when you're the man or woman in the arena and your heart's right and you
[03:09:11.480 --> 03:09:17.800]  fight hard you're not a loser when you lose I failed thousands of times in the
[03:09:17.800 --> 03:09:22.440]  25 years I've been on there and I do shows routinely that I think I did a
[03:09:22.440 --> 03:09:26.160]  bad job doesn't matter my heart's right and God chose King David instead of man
[03:09:26.160 --> 03:09:29.640]  of her own heart he did horrible things had his best friend killed in a moment
[03:09:29.640 --> 03:09:33.400]  of total loss he wanted that wife he later repented and he legitimately did
[03:09:33.400 --> 03:09:36.640]  it God said you're a man of her own heart I've never done anything close to
[03:09:36.640 --> 03:09:42.960]  that doesn't mean I'm perfect far from it but this is a real war a real world a
[03:09:42.960 --> 03:09:48.120]  real choice about your soul just like people know that digital data goes on
[03:09:48.120 --> 03:09:54.080]  forever if it's saved our souls are beyond that and the enemy knows it and
[03:09:54.080 --> 03:09:59.720]  they want us to be part of the devil's seedy collection not to go on to the
[03:09:59.720 --> 03:10:04.480]  next level and that's what this is all about that's why they hate us because
[03:10:04.480 --> 03:10:09.560]  we're saying you have value humanity has value there is human life there is a
[03:10:09.560 --> 03:10:19.000]  God babies have value you go out to a leftist event and half of them will
[03:10:19.000 --> 03:10:21.920]  tell you they're devil worshipers they're not trying to upset you it's who
[03:10:21.920 --> 03:10:24.520]  they are it's their operating system believe it laughs they don't believe in
[03:10:24.520 --> 03:10:28.240]  the devil but they do they manifest it see the deception devil isn't real I'm
[03:10:28.240 --> 03:10:31.720]  deceiving you but I want to kill babies up to age three they say there is no
[03:10:31.720 --> 03:10:35.720]  lies there's nothing anyways you don't have any free will you're just a machine
[03:10:35.720 --> 03:10:43.240]  so let me tell you how to live that cue her up
[03:10:43.240 --> 03:10:46.280]  with Caitlyn Bennett I don't know what we're gonna put this video out on
[03:10:46.280 --> 03:10:50.120]  inforworks.com it deserves to go totally viral I'm gonna ask go and I'm gonna ask
[03:10:50.120 --> 03:10:57.360]  Tom Pepper what do you call it leftist video leftist say we should kill
[03:10:57.360 --> 03:11:01.480]  children up to age three I mean that's see how just a few months ago was the
[03:11:01.480 --> 03:11:09.760]  governor saying we keep him comfortable we decide they did take their organ then
[03:11:09.760 --> 03:11:14.840]  we resuscitate mama want them it's all a bioethics term they call the child dad
[03:11:14.840 --> 03:11:18.400]  even though they're alive until they decide to let them live they go magic
[03:11:18.400 --> 03:11:22.920]  wand resuscitate because they want to be able to keep them alive and take the
[03:11:22.920 --> 03:11:28.480]  organs it's all games and should we put up with this these people's so-called
[03:11:28.480 --> 03:11:33.600]  authority over us when they have no authority here's that video one more
[03:11:33.600 --> 03:11:38.560]  time so when do we cut off abortions at what week I think at three years old
[03:11:38.560 --> 03:11:42.360]  it's when we should you think at three years old is when we should stop
[03:11:42.360 --> 03:11:48.520]  aborting children yeah hey pause and back this up hit pause start over even
[03:11:48.520 --> 03:11:51.560]  before she gets that point back it up like 40 seconds I want you're in the
[03:11:51.560 --> 03:11:56.160]  beginning of this if you're a radio listener she she has the greenish
[03:11:56.160 --> 03:12:01.040]  white skin collapse shoulders dead eyes but when she talks about killing babies
[03:12:01.040 --> 03:12:06.480]  she gets a smile and light comes in her eyes folks you see the actresses that's
[03:12:06.480 --> 03:12:11.800]  Linda Blair that's an actress this is real this is who they are and I told you
[03:12:11.800 --> 03:12:14.640]  their next plan is up to age three that's the official rollout she's now
[03:12:14.640 --> 03:12:23.400]  spouting Peter singer pita eugenic stuff but just remember that and she goes
[03:12:23.400 --> 03:12:27.880]  yeah they start talking a bunch by then and she's all disgusted by these other
[03:12:27.880 --> 03:12:35.600]  humans she's not a human whatever it is she's hijacked by a spirit and I'm
[03:12:35.600 --> 03:12:39.600]  gonna explain this I knew God was real notice the media never attacks me for
[03:12:39.600 --> 03:12:45.760]  this stuff you know it's far out I knew God was real a long time ago but I was
[03:12:45.760 --> 03:12:49.280]  in Seattle last year when you saw me get coffee dumped on me and the rest of it
[03:12:49.280 --> 03:12:54.360]  he started running video all the time because it was so crazy and and Michael's
[03:12:54.360 --> 03:12:57.600]  everyone who's a smart tough guy he wouldn't leave the hotel anymore after
[03:12:57.600 --> 03:13:03.680]  three days we were there a week and you know why
[03:13:03.680 --> 03:13:11.120]  you ever seen like Christian horror movies were like agent Smith kind of the
[03:13:11.120 --> 03:13:14.400]  matrix jumps from one body the next and finishes the sentences around each block
[03:13:14.400 --> 03:13:19.240]  like hey we're following you we're gonna get you Neo next block yeah I just saw
[03:13:19.240 --> 03:13:25.280]  you there I'm gonna get you glad I just killed your friend that's in the Bible
[03:13:25.280 --> 03:13:28.600]  where you'll be walking through the city and demons jumping into person after
[03:13:28.600 --> 03:13:33.880]  person making statements as you go and I'll never forget we're walking down
[03:13:33.880 --> 03:13:40.720]  these streets and I with my wife and my baby and every third or fourth person
[03:13:40.720 --> 03:13:45.920]  would literally go like we're gonna get you you're gonna die in a demon voice and
[03:13:45.920 --> 03:13:48.120]  this wasn't just them all getting together do this and we turn the corner
[03:13:48.120 --> 03:13:52.120]  they go yeah you think you just turn the corner we're not here it was the same
[03:13:52.120 --> 03:13:59.880]  voice and you're like wait a minute these people are so synced up to whatever it
[03:13:59.880 --> 03:14:04.120]  is running maybe it's mind control there's some secret broadcast system the
[03:14:04.120 --> 03:14:07.560]  government has her testing in Seattle I don't know but they were saying the same
[03:14:07.560 --> 03:14:14.040]  stuff in the same order in the same way like I'm not even gonna tell this story
[03:14:14.040 --> 03:14:17.000]  because she hasn't authorized me yet and I haven't talked to her since she was in
[03:14:17.000 --> 03:14:20.440]  Austin I talked to folks that were there but Caitlin Bennett Millie Weaver were
[03:14:20.440 --> 03:14:24.720]  down there when this woman said all this about killing babies up to age 3 and it
[03:14:24.720 --> 03:14:29.200]  freaked them out because they would go they were down there and when they left
[03:14:29.200 --> 03:14:34.080]  they would turn corners and the same thing happened people would walk up and
[03:14:34.080 --> 03:14:39.000]  finish the sentence and they were saying terrible things to Caitlin about what
[03:14:39.000 --> 03:14:45.400]  they were gonna do to her and about her body and they were finishing the
[03:14:45.400 --> 03:14:48.760]  sentences they hadn't been brief folks these people can hardly tie their shoe
[03:14:48.760 --> 03:14:54.880]  laces these are all incompetent losers but what's in them like when Christ comes
[03:14:54.880 --> 03:14:58.640]  along the possessed guy he says who are you they go I am Legion and Christ says
[03:14:58.640 --> 03:15:01.840]  you know out of them Satan and the demons go in the pigs they run off the
[03:15:01.840 --> 03:15:09.240]  cliff because they wanted out of the pigs and back in humans and you know I
[03:15:09.240 --> 03:15:12.680]  oh that's the Bible how hot no it's just like the internet just like programs are
[03:15:12.680 --> 03:15:16.360]  in the air there's these programs these spells these people under spells they're
[03:15:16.360 --> 03:15:21.440]  under trances they're under programs and when and let me tell you haven't
[03:15:21.440 --> 03:15:24.640]  experienced it till you run into a nest of these people and they're finishing
[03:15:24.640 --> 03:15:31.960]  each other's sentences I mean it was the craziest stuff I've ever seen in my life
[03:15:31.960 --> 03:15:36.680]  and it is scary folks these people are possessed by something is another
[03:15:36.680 --> 03:15:41.840]  dimension is it demons is it space aliens I don't know but they want to kill
[03:15:41.840 --> 03:15:52.520]  babies they want to kill the planet they want to kill you it's real folks oh

[03:19:52.680 --> 03:20:12.040]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:20:12.040 --> 03:20:30.960]  I was watching like court TV when it's around like 15 years ago and I keep
[03:20:30.960 --> 03:20:34.040]  telling the crew this they're awesome but we need to look this up there was a
[03:20:34.040 --> 03:20:38.760]  blonde hair good-looking psychiatrist I don't want bought one of her books when
[03:20:38.760 --> 03:20:46.880]  I saw her on court TV she was who was the guy that Jeffrey Dahmer's psychiatrist
[03:20:46.880 --> 03:20:52.560]  but she was she's the famous just type in famous woman psychiatrist psychiatrist
[03:20:52.560 --> 03:20:58.160]  to the to the psychopaths on television I saw her on TV I heard her on coast to
[03:20:58.160 --> 03:21:00.960]  coast I saw it all over I want to get her back on she came home for like two
[03:21:00.960 --> 03:21:05.800]  hours on our show and she never brought up the occult when I got her on I said
[03:21:05.800 --> 03:21:09.880]  listen I've read your book I've seen some of the stuff these people think they're
[03:21:09.880 --> 03:21:12.960]  being demon-possessed and if they don't do it the demons come after him she goes
[03:21:12.960 --> 03:21:15.880]  no that's true everybody I talked to thought demons were making him do it
[03:21:15.880 --> 03:21:19.320]  now whether you think that's psychiatric or real it doesn't matter it's a
[03:21:19.320 --> 03:21:22.920]  program they're running and it's a big frustration some of the years I always
[03:21:22.920 --> 03:21:28.200]  remember this one I kind of mentioned it we never find it but I'll find it
[03:21:28.200 --> 03:21:33.440]  listeners will find it they'll send it to us she's like the psychiatrist to the
[03:21:33.440 --> 03:21:37.880]  serial killers I think and we should get her back on but but I'm digressing
[03:21:37.880 --> 03:21:40.400]  we're gonna Tom Pappert right now about the world what's happening it was
[03:21:40.400 --> 03:21:43.760]  Memorial Day appreciate him joining us oh and comments on what I've been saying
[03:21:43.760 --> 03:21:50.480]  well well Alex I would just say to kind of talk about the spiritual battle in a
[03:21:50.480 --> 03:21:56.920]  final word you know if God is love and the devil is hate I think that you can
[03:21:56.920 --> 03:22:01.640]  kind of break down everything like that because it doesn't matter what Trump
[03:22:01.640 --> 03:22:08.000]  does he could cure cancer he could end world hunger you know whatever they'd
[03:22:08.000 --> 03:22:13.520]  still hate him his you know his haters would still hate him it's the same thing
[03:22:13.520 --> 03:22:17.520]  with inforce the people are still that they're driven by hate so when you see a
[03:22:17.520 --> 03:22:21.720]  young lady like in the Caitlyn Bennett video talking about aborting babies up
[03:22:21.720 --> 03:22:25.920]  to the age of three you know does she really believe that does she not probably
[03:22:25.920 --> 03:22:31.440]  not what she what it is is she's driven by hatred Alex she hates us she hates
[03:22:31.440 --> 03:22:36.000]  America she hates the fact that we stand up for babies so it doesn't matter what
[03:22:36.000 --> 03:22:39.600]  we stand up for in fact if we came out tomorrow and said yeah abort all babies
[03:22:39.600 --> 03:22:43.760]  up to three all the sudden they would be pro-life that's what this is all about
[03:22:43.760 --> 03:22:49.260]  they are driven by hate hate has filled their soul and so whatever it is they
[03:22:49.260 --> 03:22:53.360]  hate they go against it there is no logic no I agree with you but at the end
[03:22:53.360 --> 03:22:55.360]  of the day it's about killing kids they actually found her let's put her on
[03:22:55.360 --> 03:23:01.440]  screen and this lady Helen Morrison forensic psychiatrist interviewed all
[03:23:01.440 --> 03:23:04.920]  the big serial killers we need to get her back on the show great points Owen
[03:23:04.920 --> 03:23:08.880]  let's go to Tom Papertom thanks for hosting thanks for joining us and the
[03:23:08.880 --> 03:23:12.760]  great work you do you've been of course censored a lot for the okay symbol now
[03:23:12.760 --> 03:23:17.920]  that was big national news last week you're at real GE Trump God Emperor
[03:23:17.920 --> 03:23:21.200]  Trump we're not saying he's actual God it's a joke folks facebook.com
[03:23:21.200 --> 03:23:24.960]  forward slash God Emperor Trump official and you manage one of the fine TV
[03:23:24.960 --> 03:23:29.800]  stations we're on here in the United States what's on your plate today there's
[03:23:29.800 --> 03:23:34.920]  so much to cover you've heard us ranting just about the left well there is a lot
[03:23:34.920 --> 03:23:38.440]  to cover I want to talk about some of the recent fake news examples in the
[03:23:38.440 --> 03:23:42.080]  media how they can say whatever they want so they get by with it but then God
[03:23:42.080 --> 03:23:46.440]  forbid somebody on the right gets a fact 2% wrong but you know Alex I've been
[03:23:46.440 --> 03:23:50.120]  listening to what you guys are talking about about the greater spiritual battle
[03:23:50.120 --> 03:23:53.000]  that's going on here and especially when it comes to these serial killers you
[03:23:53.000 --> 03:23:58.640]  know the the insane person in Florida from last year he actually said that in
[03:23:58.640 --> 03:24:01.680]  his tapes where the interview tapes or he was being interviewed by a police
[03:24:01.680 --> 03:24:05.720]  detective he said the demon talks to me and I have to do it the other one is in
[03:24:05.720 --> 03:24:08.560]  me and I have to do it so I think that you're absolutely on to something and I
[03:24:08.560 --> 03:24:13.240]  also think regardless of what it is if it's a code if it's a demon if it's a
[03:24:13.240 --> 03:24:17.080]  spirit whatever it is I think it's completely accurate that that is what
[03:24:17.080 --> 03:24:21.760]  caused these people my both pastors for my church are currently in Tanzania right
[03:24:21.760 --> 03:24:25.720]  now doing missionary work and they've converted a thousand plus people doing
[03:24:25.720 --> 03:24:29.640]  some phenomenal work out there and one of them I was talking to him and he said
[03:24:29.640 --> 03:24:32.960]  you know I really didn't want to go on this thing but I was singing one of our
[03:24:32.960 --> 03:24:36.960]  Gospels and I couldn't sing it the Holy Spirit would not let me sing it because
[03:24:36.960 --> 03:24:41.160]  I wouldn't go where the Lord wanted me to go and so then he agreed to go to
[03:24:41.160 --> 03:24:46.480]  Tanzania and if that can happen why on earth could that not happen with an evil
[03:24:46.480 --> 03:24:51.720]  force of force of a demon or whatever it is with these insane leftists and you're
[03:24:51.720 --> 03:24:54.760]  right I've experienced the same exact thing they complete each other's
[03:24:54.760 --> 03:24:59.160]  sentences they say the exact same script and they're not talking to each other
[03:24:59.160 --> 03:25:03.840]  and I think that's why fascinatingly when you get them on a one-on-one situation
[03:25:03.840 --> 03:25:08.360]  where they're not connected to the rest of the machine you can almost talk some
[03:25:08.360 --> 03:25:12.720]  sense into them but then of course they get back right see the transmission kind
[03:25:12.720 --> 03:25:16.800]  of break up and go wait who am I what knows oh shut up I'll get you and your
[03:25:16.800 --> 03:25:22.760]  family oh wait where oh I mean it's crazy exactly the very second they get
[03:25:22.760 --> 03:25:26.800]  back into their evil little tribe everything you've done is gone that's
[03:25:26.800 --> 03:25:29.640]  why you know that's why I think it's so important to do what info wars does what
[03:25:29.640 --> 03:25:33.960]  I do without what all of us do because to an extent there is no winning some of
[03:25:33.960 --> 03:25:37.200]  these people over they have to make the decision on their own they have to choose
[03:25:37.200 --> 03:25:42.720]  God they have to choose love they have to choose to look away from hate as Owen
[03:25:42.720 --> 03:25:47.200]  would put it and it is so that's what makes this broadcast different because
[03:25:47.200 --> 03:25:52.600]  you guys are the tip of the spear and you're able to provide so much crucial
[03:25:52.600 --> 03:25:55.880]  information Alex I'm gonna be completely honest a month or so ago when I was on
[03:25:55.880 --> 03:25:59.840]  you were talking about keeping the babies alive so you can harvest their
[03:25:59.840 --> 03:26:04.040]  organs and I kind of knew that that was a thing but in the last month we've seen
[03:26:04.040 --> 03:26:07.720]  not one not two but three different articles that I've read personally about
[03:26:07.720 --> 03:26:11.320]  Planned Parents and doing exactly that they keep the baby alive as long as they
[03:26:11.320 --> 03:26:15.840]  can so they can get more money for the organs but they consider it legally dead
[03:26:15.840 --> 03:26:20.720]  because it was never born it was never a human so it's fascinating to me oh you
[03:26:20.720 --> 03:26:26.800]  know my dad my dad was in medical management and when I was growing up in
[03:26:26.800 --> 03:26:30.280]  Dallas he even owned with the two partners a hospital and they weren't
[03:26:30.280 --> 03:26:34.920]  killing people but like I said when I went to get my driver's license I passed
[03:26:34.920 --> 03:26:39.880]  the driver's safety thing he said son don't sign that organ card and I said
[03:26:39.880 --> 03:26:42.960]  why and he goes well some of the local hospitals you're in a car wreck or
[03:26:42.960 --> 03:26:46.200]  something they'll kill you they'll keep you alive and take your organs and say
[03:26:46.200 --> 03:26:50.200]  you have your brain dead and like 10 years later I'm watching 60 minutes of
[03:26:50.200 --> 03:26:56.160]  my grandparents house in Austin in college or out of college and they were
[03:26:56.160 --> 03:27:00.560]  showing the Dallas hospitals my dad was telling me about so yeah this is sick my
[03:27:00.560 --> 03:27:05.280]  friend and it is absolutely fascinating you know our editor-in-chief at big league
[03:27:05.280 --> 03:27:08.560]  politics Patrick Hallie likes to say that you are his Walter Cronkite and I
[03:27:08.560 --> 03:27:12.000]  completely understand why Patrick says that he's absolutely right so we need
[03:27:12.000 --> 03:27:14.560]  to get Patrick home he gets you a show here on air we're trying to get the
[03:27:14.560 --> 03:27:17.480]  board ops and people hired hopefully we're getting close to that time and the
[03:27:17.480 --> 03:27:22.680]  great work you do and KCTU 5 they're in Kansas and Wichita which is you know a
[03:27:22.680 --> 03:27:25.600]  great story not bragging when people are hungry for the truth put us on a few
[03:27:25.600 --> 03:27:28.840]  year and a half ago already gone to number one in the local ratings that is
[03:27:28.840 --> 03:27:32.320]  very very exciting and I thank you and the folks that were picking a show up
[03:27:32.320 --> 03:27:35.960]  oh absolutely Alex it's been our pleasure and it's been our pleasure to be

[03:27:44.960 --> 03:27:48.880]  license they may want to but you know it is fascinating we do get people we know
[03:27:48.880 --> 03:27:53.720]  trying to hire office staff sales people that type of thing and once they
[03:27:53.720 --> 03:27:58.160]  find out that info wars is involved either people have an amazing reaction to
[03:27:58.160 --> 03:28:01.160]  it they can't wait to be a part of the team it's the biggest moment of their
[03:28:01.160 --> 03:28:06.200]  lives or again it's this hatred this oh my god you're an Alex Jones you're a

[03:32:32.680 --> 03:32:37.840]  populist organization so they thought first they come for Alex Jones then
[03:32:37.840 --> 03:32:42.440]  when people say okay take him off the air everyone else like dominoes would fall
[03:32:42.440 --> 03:32:46.800]  the way to fight back is to support info wars now more than ever and make it a
[03:32:46.800 --> 03:32:50.600]  standard of freedom and free speech understand that they believe they can
[03:32:50.600 --> 03:32:54.880]  take us down they'll take everybody else down
[03:32:56.360 --> 03:33:01.760]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[03:33:01.760 --> 03:33:04.760]  you
[03:33:14.320 --> 03:33:27.240]  cause mama's gonna help build the wall we're smashing down those walls in the
[03:33:27.240 --> 03:33:31.880]  mines but to have our safe country where we can live our lives and have our
[03:33:31.880 --> 03:33:35.320]  taxes spent on us and our families we are building the wall because the UN and
[03:33:35.320 --> 03:33:40.320]  the globalist are trying to destroy our country the first part about freedom is
[03:33:40.320 --> 03:33:44.200]  standing up for yourself and saying I'm a self-contained unit I'm not somebody
[03:33:44.200 --> 03:33:49.200]  else's slave Tom Pappert ride the shotgun weather's great talk show hosts
[03:33:49.200 --> 03:33:55.800]  his own right manager of KCTU 5 there in the heartland of America I want
[03:33:55.800 --> 03:34:00.720]  Troyer who's also from that nearby area he's from St. Louis which talk Kansas

[03:34:05.640 --> 03:34:09.960]  want to hit some final news here before I turn over to Tom and in the war room
[03:34:09.960 --> 03:34:21.040]  coming up with this I used to project my own humanity onto the globalist in
[03:34:21.040 --> 03:34:28.560]  our minions but the more I studied them imagine how much you worry about your
[03:34:28.560 --> 03:34:31.920]  children if you've got children like a lot of us have I got four children
[03:34:31.920 --> 03:34:36.040]  imagine how much you worry about your wife when she goes out or your husband
[03:34:36.040 --> 03:34:42.200]  imagine how much you worry about people if you care well that gets tiring for a
[03:34:42.200 --> 03:34:48.520]  lot of folks so they start not caring or maybe they never care and then instead
[03:34:48.520 --> 03:34:52.840]  caring about unborn babies you get off on the power of killing them because
[03:34:52.840 --> 03:34:57.760]  you're so soulless the only thing that excites you is evil and and and that's
[03:34:57.760 --> 03:35:03.680]  what we're coming down to that's what we're dealing with you know I've got an
[03:35:03.680 --> 03:35:06.760]  article here out of Yahoo news it's pretty powerful that we could put it on
[03:35:06.760 --> 03:35:12.840]  screen for TV viewers ever is traffic jams survivors call for tougher rules
[03:35:12.840 --> 03:35:18.280]  really gonna put some bureaucrats up there some police officers when there
[03:35:18.280 --> 03:35:22.360]  are no rules in some place that inhospitable up there you know 20

[03:35:27.760 --> 03:35:32.640]  a week you're trying to get to the top there's traffic jams
[03:35:35.200 --> 03:35:42.600]  and then people are calling for the government to make it like an amusement
[03:35:42.600 --> 03:35:48.160]  park and make everybody safe you're climbing the tallest mountain that's

[03:36:13.400 --> 03:36:18.640]  feet tallest Mount Everest helicopters can't even get up to 20,000 feet but the
[03:36:18.640 --> 03:36:27.040]  bureaucrats want people to be there and hold their hand listen if you want 29,000
[03:36:27.040 --> 03:36:32.640]  feet to the summit if you want to risk your life that's your business you want
[03:36:32.640 --> 03:36:37.000]  to go whitewater rafting you want to go skydiving that's your business but
[03:36:37.000 --> 03:36:44.560]  that's not my business I'm not afraid of risking my life but I'm afraid of
[03:36:44.560 --> 03:36:49.360]  risking it for something that doesn't matter and I got to tell you I've been
[03:36:49.360 --> 03:36:52.880]  around some of these mountain climbers I've been around some of these triathletes
[03:36:52.880 --> 03:36:58.040]  and man these guys are super awesome and they've got themselves together and
[03:36:58.040 --> 03:37:02.240]  they're alpha males but they hardly spend time with their families so they can go
[03:37:02.240 --> 03:37:06.920]  out and compete and run 50 miles a day or a hundred miles in two days or so
[03:37:06.920 --> 03:37:10.400]  they can show off they're not even making money most of them but it's about showing
[03:37:10.400 --> 03:37:15.600]  how great they are and that selfishness and I'm not saying you shouldn't be able
[03:37:15.600 --> 03:37:22.920]  to climb down Everest I'm saying I think you're pathetic it's one thing of no way
[03:37:22.920 --> 03:37:26.600]  to ever climbed it you were the first hundred explorers but tens of thousands
[03:37:26.600 --> 03:37:29.600]  have scaled at summits now that look up how many have successfully I'm just
[03:37:29.600 --> 03:37:32.320]  going for memory it's over 10,000 thousands a year now
[03:37:32.320 --> 03:37:37.400]  but pull the article there's big lines the last thousand feet everyone just
[03:37:37.400 --> 03:37:41.800]  way to the top and take selfies that they climb sound ever Mount Everest why
[03:37:41.800 --> 03:37:46.560]  don't you go help homeless kids why don't you go find a cure for cancer why
[03:37:46.560 --> 03:37:49.800]  don't you go do something
[03:37:52.200 --> 03:37:58.040]  four thousand have climbed Mount Everest it's more than that now but the point is
[03:37:58.040 --> 03:38:04.480]  is that can we pull up the article I mentioned it's the top of y'all who knows
[03:38:04.480 --> 03:38:11.360]  I want to show TV viewers this big line yeah there it is hundreds and hundreds
[03:38:11.360 --> 03:38:18.000]  of people backed up to get the top what does that do you know if you could get
[03:38:18.000 --> 03:38:24.120]  200 feet from the summit that you could get there but that's the sense of being
[03:38:24.120 --> 03:38:27.840]  that's the sense of achievement some people want a billion dollars some people
[03:38:27.840 --> 03:38:30.960]  want the trophy wife some people want to win the race car race and if you're
[03:38:30.960 --> 03:38:34.000]  doing that it's not your god that's fine if you're raising a race car money and
[03:38:34.000 --> 03:38:38.680]  risking your life to do something worthy that's great but I just don't get all
[03:38:38.680 --> 03:38:44.520]  these committed smart good-looking people black white old young who are so
[03:38:44.520 --> 03:38:50.720]  self-centered it's all about some feet they can accomplish instead of the feet
[03:38:50.720 --> 03:38:54.800]  of building a better world being a human being involved everything is so
[03:38:54.800 --> 03:38:59.760]  selfish Tom peppered oh and Troy do you get where I'm going with this they'll
[03:38:59.760 --> 03:39:04.600]  put all this in the some of the best and smartest people we've got but it's all
[03:39:04.600 --> 03:39:08.840]  about how great they are and I'm all about self you know empowerment but it
[03:39:08.840 --> 03:39:13.080]  becomes satanic it becomes sick because you get around these sports people and
[03:39:13.080 --> 03:39:16.360]  around these climbers and around these super fitness guys they don't give a
[03:39:16.360 --> 03:39:19.880]  damn about anybody but they're self on average and they don't put that
[03:39:19.880 --> 03:39:24.680]  incredible energy they've got to win the world champion arm wrestling or the NFL
[03:39:24.680 --> 03:39:30.720]  or whatever into humanity when we need humanity well I'd say this I think that
[03:39:30.720 --> 03:39:33.720]  it's kind of symbolic that line of people trying to get to the peak of
[03:39:33.720 --> 03:39:37.240]  Mount Everest just for their own sense of accomplishment it's kind of like the
[03:39:37.240 --> 03:39:41.000]  line of Democrats trying to remove Trump from the peak none of them are
[03:39:41.000 --> 03:39:44.920]  gonna do it but they're all probably gonna die on their way up but Alex this
[03:39:44.920 --> 03:39:49.840]  is something that I realized probably too late in my life but but sooner than
[03:39:49.840 --> 03:39:53.960]  later is better yeah I mean you always wonder when you're a sports fan and all
[03:39:53.960 --> 03:39:57.440]  that stuff I was working in sports media but it didn't really deliver anything
[03:39:57.440 --> 03:40:01.360]  for me it was fun it paid the bills maybe it was you know a career but it
[03:40:01.360 --> 03:40:07.400]  didn't really fulfill me and so as soon as I took the red pill and I did a pivot
[03:40:07.400 --> 03:40:10.800]  to politics and current events I started feeling that fulfillment that I wasn't
[03:40:10.800 --> 03:40:13.320]  getting from sports media but it's the same thing that you were just saying
[03:40:13.320 --> 03:40:17.520]  actually they pour their heart their mind their their essence into something
[03:40:17.520 --> 03:40:22.440]  that could never and will never fulfill them I mean that that's that is the
[03:40:22.440 --> 03:40:26.920]  devil exactly imagine the devil laughing when God gave us all this energy
[03:40:26.920 --> 03:40:32.400]  they're climbing a 29,000 foot mountain with 100 mile winds climbing over dead
[03:40:32.400 --> 03:40:37.800]  bodies to show everybody how big their ding-dong is and they're not doing
[03:40:37.800 --> 03:40:42.600]  anything for humanity or to fight the leftist takeover while drag Queen
[03:40:42.600 --> 03:40:46.840]  story times happening and convicted pedophiles without asking parents have
[03:40:46.840 --> 03:40:53.120]  your five-year-old bouncing on their their crotch Tom you know Alex it really
[03:40:53.120 --> 03:40:56.680]  makes me think of one of the perhaps more challenging things that Christians
[03:40:56.680 --> 03:41:00.600]  have to struggle with and that's putting God at the center and you know I
[03:41:00.600 --> 03:41:03.840]  struggle with that I'm sure everybody struggles with and we all get so caught
[03:41:03.840 --> 03:41:06.760]  up in our shows and our articles and everything that we've got to do to try
[03:41:06.760 --> 03:41:11.760]  to save this country and save this world but that is a whole lot closer than
[03:41:11.760 --> 03:41:15.760]  these people and it can be ever this is a beautiful example because it's such a
[03:41:15.760 --> 03:41:19.200]  silly thing if you think about it look I can walk to the top of a high surface
[03:41:19.200 --> 03:41:22.400]  and I can breathe the thin air and I don't die oh congratulations you've
[03:41:22.400 --> 03:41:26.280]  really achieved a lot but it's a great example and there's so many people who
[03:41:26.280 --> 03:41:30.280]  are like you just said it like Bob Dylan said gotta serve somebody they claim
[03:41:30.280 --> 03:41:35.600]  there isn't a God but their God's getting the top of a mountain and and so
[03:41:35.600 --> 03:41:40.000]  again they're making that their God that's what you're saying exactly exactly
[03:41:40.000 --> 03:41:43.760]  you know I'm I'm a Lutheran church Missouri Senad Lutheran here so we
[03:41:43.760 --> 03:41:47.400]  they say we're baptized in vinegar we're all the time looking at our looking at
[03:41:47.400 --> 03:41:50.160]  how sinful the world is and how terrible things are but you know when you see
[03:41:50.160 --> 03:41:53.760]  stuff like this and you think what is the matter with these people they're not
[03:41:53.760 --> 03:41:58.960]  doing this to serve anything they're not selfish look how tough I am you're not
[03:41:58.960 --> 03:42:01.280]  going to the top of the mountain to save kids look look at the opposite of
[03:42:01.280 --> 03:42:06.200]  Satanism was it Thailand with the 40-something kids two miles underground
[03:42:06.200 --> 03:42:11.360]  divers dying kids dying got guys risking their total lives to go in and do
[03:42:11.360 --> 03:42:16.200]  that that was the opposite of climbing Mount Everest right and you know they
[03:42:16.200 --> 03:42:19.280]  don't even think you know there are ways that you can I mean there were kids you
[03:42:19.280 --> 03:42:23.240]  gotta save at the top of the mountain do it but why totally risk your life for
[03:42:23.240 --> 03:42:27.560]  no reason you know get somebody to donate a hundred thousand dollars toward
[03:42:27.560 --> 03:42:31.080]  child cancer research if you make it to the top something but this doesn't even
[03:42:31.080 --> 03:42:35.120]  cross their minds no it's just it's all about themselves it's all about their
[03:42:35.120 --> 03:42:39.560]  little piece of as an accomplishment that again there's four thousand names I
[03:42:39.560 --> 03:42:43.280]  don't know five of them I don't know they want to be in a club exactly it's
[03:42:43.280 --> 03:42:47.440]  like being a tranny or whatever it makes you an elite group cut your testicles

[03:47:22.920 --> 03:47:28.320]  wars we fight on wars we fight and griping about the way things are
[03:47:28.320 --> 03:47:32.840]  hard to turn off moral anger didn't I don't want to finish up with some
[03:47:32.840 --> 03:47:37.560]  paper don't short let me add one more little dessert or addendum to what I
[03:47:37.560 --> 03:47:41.800]  said is it satanic the climb Mount Everest and I don't think the answer is
[03:47:41.800 --> 03:47:46.200]  yes it's in all of our hearts what we do and the first people to do it I I
[03:47:46.200 --> 03:47:49.680]  get it but now it's 4,000 plus now there's all these books out about
[03:47:49.680 --> 03:47:54.800]  billionaires doing it and it becomes a ding-dong measuring contest when all
[03:47:54.800 --> 03:47:58.160]  these hundreds are backed up every day trying to get to the top and everybody's
[03:47:58.160 --> 03:48:02.440]  bitching and complaining and they want traffic guards up at the but the imagine
[03:48:02.440 --> 03:48:06.400]  of these people put that energy and other things in their lives imagine how
[03:48:06.400 --> 03:48:10.240]  much better the world would be I'm not saying take away their right to go up
[03:48:10.240 --> 03:48:15.520]  there I don't want to pay for helicopter and their dead bodies off just like you
[03:48:15.520 --> 03:48:20.000]  want to go to some doctor and have your Johnson and your WAVOS cut off knock
[03:48:20.000 --> 03:48:24.400]  yourself out man I'm a libertarian if mentally ill people want to cut their
[03:48:24.400 --> 03:48:28.480]  fingers off and jump off bridges as long as you don't hurt somebody I'm sad for
[03:48:28.480 --> 03:48:32.760]  you but do it I'm a libertarian you want to get a bunch of heroin and kill
[03:48:32.760 --> 03:48:36.840]  yourself that's your business I don't want to pay for you to go to top of
[03:48:36.840 --> 03:48:41.720]  mountains or cut your ding-a-ling off and and you know I hope you won't do it
[03:48:41.720 --> 03:48:47.040]  but all I'm saying is it's getting sick when they bitch and complain in the
[03:48:47.040 --> 03:48:51.080]  news about how there's traffic jams going to the top of this mountain it gets
[03:48:51.080 --> 03:48:55.200]  sick I love rugged individualism I love trailblazing Lewis and Clark were
[03:48:55.200 --> 03:48:58.880]  risking their lives but they were getting a Western passage to the Pacific
[03:48:58.880 --> 03:49:04.480]  Ocean for a reason they were risking their lives to do something new not to
[03:49:04.480 --> 03:49:10.280]  prove how tough they were now let's shift gears with Tom Pepper great manager at
[03:49:10.280 --> 03:49:13.680]  KCTU 5 in Wichita, Kansas that carries us
[03:49:13.680 --> 03:49:20.900]  Huawei CEO says China shouldn't punish Apple boy I saw that CNN headline this
[03:49:20.900 --> 03:49:25.280]  morning and I knew out was gonna read Apple has become state run a year ago
[03:49:25.280 --> 03:49:29.360]  they moved to China over a year ago they're with the Communist Party
[03:49:29.360 --> 03:49:33.640]  Huawei's Communist Party run it's spying on all the devices is getting banned all
[03:49:33.640 --> 03:49:38.880]  of the world they got caught so CNN has this puff piece how Trump's mean the
[03:49:38.880 --> 03:49:43.760]  portable baby Huawei's and how his teacher is Apple even though he's about
[03:49:43.760 --> 03:49:48.800]  to replace Apple sales in Europe and in Asia and what they call Greater China
[03:49:48.800 --> 03:49:54.520]  Taiwan it's all chai-com written he's like oh don't mess with Apple because
[03:49:54.520 --> 03:49:58.400]  it's chai-com run now too and they've got the code keys and they admit they're
[03:49:58.400 --> 03:50:04.400]  spying on you through Apple just as bad as Huawei so he's like oh we don't want
[03:50:04.400 --> 03:50:15.440]  to kick them out of China or oh no Apple good good Apple this is sick you think
[03:50:15.440 --> 03:50:21.240]  you're a moron daughters in prison right now China State TV carries daily show
[03:50:21.240 --> 03:50:27.560]  spot on Huawei lead in 5g so don't worry the daily show pissing all over
[03:50:27.560 --> 03:50:33.320]  America it's on in China but they don't want anything else from the West Air
[03:50:33.320 --> 03:50:39.760]  there again chai-com propaganda Tom Papert unbelievable the daily show wants
[03:50:39.760 --> 03:50:44.080]  us off air cheers it has celebrations so do the other big so-called comedians
[03:50:44.080 --> 03:50:48.600]  who are really just fake news but the Chinese government's funding six of the
[03:50:48.600 --> 03:50:56.320]  big eight Hollywood production houses and their funding on record the major
[03:50:56.320 --> 03:51:03.280]  production operations like the folks over at Netflix and now they are openly
[03:51:03.280 --> 03:51:08.880]  involved airing the daily show when you know the communist Chinese have approved
[03:51:08.880 --> 03:51:14.000]  the daily show you know the daily show is really bad news you know it does
[03:51:14.000 --> 03:51:17.280]  actually relate really well to what we were talking about in the last segment
[03:51:17.280 --> 03:51:22.400]  because China the elite people in China their god is power and then you've got
[03:51:22.400 --> 03:51:27.120]  Tim Cook his god is money he thinks that if he merges his company with China
[03:51:27.120 --> 03:51:31.480]  then oh boy we're gonna get billions of new people who will all buy an iPhone
[03:51:31.480 --> 03:51:35.520]  and an iPad and it'll just be wonderful and will make so much money who needs
[03:51:35.520 --> 03:51:39.760]  those stupid Americans there's only 350 million of them and another 30 40
[03:51:39.760 --> 03:51:43.880]  million illegals that's that's chump change we're going to China and so he
[03:51:43.880 --> 03:51:48.400]  is essentially sacrificing his soul to China same exact thing with these
[03:51:48.400 --> 03:51:52.120]  Hollywood production houses they're not concerned about what Americans want to
[03:51:52.120 --> 03:51:55.880]  see when they go to the theater we're a relatively small audience they want to
[03:51:55.880 --> 03:52:00.360]  be one of the two or three or four American movies that gets brought into
[03:52:00.360 --> 03:52:05.280]  China so they can get all of those box office sales and again they don't want
[03:52:05.280 --> 03:52:08.760]  people like you Alex because you're the one sitting there saying wait a minute
[03:52:08.760 --> 03:52:13.640]  you are selling your soul to the devil for a couple bucks selling your country
[03:52:13.640 --> 03:52:18.000]  down the line selling it out ruining everything the West was built on
[03:52:18.000 --> 03:52:21.320]  everything America was built on a little further than that let me go further
[03:52:21.320 --> 03:52:25.160]  than that it's not just me up here like I'm saying this and I'm something
[03:52:25.160 --> 03:52:29.440]  special communist China has killed way more than Hitler ever killed they're
[03:52:29.440 --> 03:52:33.560]  totally soulless they feed on their own people slave factories and then Tim Cook
[03:52:33.560 --> 03:52:37.920]  who has the worst factories under Foxcom in China says I'm dangerous and
[03:52:37.920 --> 03:52:42.040]  deplorable need to be banned from the web he has no moral standing he's out of
[03:52:42.040 --> 03:52:48.000]  control Owen shroyer well I'm just amazed that anybody wants to air the
[03:52:48.000 --> 03:52:53.360]  daily show with with that with that guy who's not even funny these comedy
[03:52:53.360 --> 03:52:58.560]  special nightly shows haven't been funny in in years as far as I'm concerned so
[03:52:58.560 --> 03:53:01.960]  I think it really just goes to show you they want the anti-trump propaganda in
[03:53:01.960 --> 03:53:05.960]  there it's not even about entertainment I mean hell we could do a comedy bit
[03:53:05.960 --> 03:53:09.480]  right now without teleprompter anything you'd be funnier than anything the daily
[03:53:09.480 --> 03:53:13.920]  show ever did but you know I do want to point this out too because I think it is
[03:53:13.920 --> 03:53:17.040]  the same kind of attack on our humanity and I know it's a totally different
[03:53:17.040 --> 03:53:22.000]  subject but there may be a connection here sex robot threat AI girlfriends
[03:53:22.000 --> 03:53:28.080]  indistinguishable from humans after major 5g upgrade so first of all to say
[03:53:28.080 --> 03:53:32.480]  that you can't tell a robot from a human is is obviously fake news but that's the
[03:53:32.480 --> 03:53:36.920]  whole point well what's the difference it's a robot it's taking care of you and
[03:53:36.920 --> 03:53:41.000]  they teach the women to hate men and they you know the new Blade Runner oh
[03:53:41.000 --> 03:53:44.080]  he's in love with his virtual girlfriend so the virtual girlfriend will tell you
[03:53:44.080 --> 03:53:47.440]  whatever you want to hear just like Japan the men aren't even having wives
[03:53:47.440 --> 03:53:53.280]  anymore it's the end of humanity as we know it and I don't feel fine so I just
[03:53:53.280 --> 03:53:55.880]  wanted to put that out there before we sign off but there's gonna be a lot to
[03:53:55.880 --> 03:54:00.240]  get to the rest of the way this week Alex there's gonna be some social media
[03:54:00.240 --> 03:54:04.080]  news coming out there's gonna be some interesting I think debates about
[03:54:04.080 --> 03:54:08.880]  foreign invasions happening too we got a private wall that just went up in New
[03:54:08.880 --> 03:54:12.600]  Mexico so it's gonna be a crazy broadcast week here and then let's not
[03:54:12.600 --> 03:54:16.440]  forget Alex that Trump is moving against the treasonous deep state that's
[03:54:16.440 --> 03:54:19.160]  right Eric Prince of all people let's play the clip since you mentioned it
[03:54:19.160 --> 03:54:27.200]  Eric Prince of blackwater flame of fame is actually financing a wall a private
[03:54:27.200 --> 03:54:31.520]  wall we build the wall in New Mexico where everything is collapsing here's a
[03:54:31.520 --> 03:54:33.800]  clip of that
[03:54:33.800 --> 03:54:47.840]  look since Prince is involved all his pain scene is working just fine
[03:54:48.480 --> 03:54:54.640]  radio listeners are missing this is an infowars dot com or slash show
[03:54:54.640 --> 03:55:07.640]  look folks bottom line Tom Pepper this country is under globalist attack I have

[03:55:33.200 --> 03:55:37.240]  and it's the opposite of what Obama did during all his eight years he wanted to
[03:55:37.240 --> 03:55:40.640]  put them in the red states that's why we have the Hamas caucus in Congress now
[03:55:40.640 --> 03:55:45.000]  because you put enough Somali refugees there and suddenly they vote one of
[03:55:45.000 --> 03:55:51.680]  their own in I mean it is a refresh we love our Somalis we love our Muslims too

[03:58:47.440 --> 03:58:52.720]  introducing pollen block we have found an extraordinary new natural way to
[03:58:52.720 --> 03:58:57.040]  alleviate seasonal distress symptoms including promoting clear nasal and
[03:58:57.040 --> 03:59:02.720]  sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory function. In the 1960s
[03:59:02.720 --> 03:59:06.640]  researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs
[03:59:06.640 --> 03:59:11.320]  experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses. They began
[03:59:11.320 --> 03:59:15.840]  studying this effect in published trials and decades later we now have the fruit
[03:59:15.840 --> 03:59:20.560]  of this research a fast-acting chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal
[03:59:20.560 --> 03:59:25.120]  distress symptoms. Pollen block is natural and effective it is not an
[03:59:25.120 --> 03:59:29.200]  antihistamine in fact current research has found that it actually acts by
[03:59:29.200 --> 03:59:33.640]  blocking the activity of tryptase which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and
[03:59:33.640 --> 03:59:38.240]  inflammatory responses in the body. Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[03:59:38.240 --> 03:59:45.560]  Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
