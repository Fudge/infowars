[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:12.000 --> 00:26.000]  Here we are live, thank you so much for joining us, I'm your host Alex Jones, we'll be here
[00:26.000 --> 00:36.000]  in just two hours, it's already Sunday the 26th of February 2017, we're almost two months through
[00:36.000 --> 00:44.000]  the new year and 40-something days into what you'd call the attempt of nationalism and individualism
[00:44.000 --> 00:51.000]  to reassert itself over the globalist, which is just nothing but a corporate form of colonialism
[00:51.000 --> 00:58.000]  and world government over the nation-state, the family and the individual in an attempt to create
[00:58.000 --> 01:07.000]  a global consolidation over humanity. Trump continues to amaze, in fact, I've got to set aside a day
[01:07.000 --> 01:13.000]  just to go over all of our research and try to chronicle everything Trump's done legislatively,
[01:13.000 --> 01:20.000]  politically, culturally, spiritually, because all the time I just remember something else amazing he did
[01:20.000 --> 01:26.000]  and listen, I'm not just here cheerleading Trump, it's a fact you really can't avoid this.
[01:26.000 --> 01:31.000]  He came out in the last few days and said I'm not going to the White House Correspondence Dinner.
[01:31.000 --> 01:37.000]  You've turned it into a demonization of the presidency and a bullying fest and I'm the only reason
[01:37.000 --> 01:43.000]  there's ratings, MSM only has ratings when I'm on your channel, so guess what, I'm not going.
[01:43.000 --> 01:47.000]  He was actually nicer than that, but guaranteed that's the obvious reason.
[01:47.000 --> 01:53.000]  I kept saying weeks ago when MSM was like we're going to boycott or we're going to attack Trump with this,
[01:53.000 --> 02:00.000]  I said don't go and I said what is CNN and MSNBC doing the front row of the White House, press the court,
[02:00.000 --> 02:06.000]  let them in but just don't always just go to them like we're going to kiss their butt and they'll finally be nice.
[02:06.000 --> 02:13.000]  I say have a lottery where you literally put your name in as press, it scrambles it,
[02:13.000 --> 02:20.000]  and then they hand out a hundred of them or something, seriously.
[02:20.000 --> 02:28.000]  But now this week they had a press conference without CNN, The New York Times and others being there.
[02:28.000 --> 02:37.000]  Isn't that beautiful? Because hey, a lot of the times regular newspapers, radio stations, TV networks, stuff bigger than you.
[02:37.000 --> 02:46.000]  Sometimes there's not room, sometimes they set up the list every few weeks, sometimes major Christian channels with more viewers than CNN can't get in.
[02:46.000 --> 02:54.000]  Why can't they be there? Why is CNN God with its average show maybe 100,000 viewers?
[02:54.000 --> 03:00.000]  I mean, I can fart in the wind and it's got more people watching it and smelling it.
[03:00.000 --> 03:03.000]  I don't mean to be gross but it's a funny joke than CNN has.
[03:03.000 --> 03:11.000]  It's literally a joke and Trump everywhere he goes has gotten the best ratings in U.S. television history.
[03:11.000 --> 03:16.000]  He's got the best Q-scores out there, probably anybody on TV.
[03:16.000 --> 03:21.000]  People watch him more because they've done Q-scores, means watchability in these focus groups they do.
[03:21.000 --> 03:24.000]  Trump's got more Q-scores than a beauty pageant.
[03:24.000 --> 03:27.000]  Of course he hosted those as well, figuring that out.
[03:27.000 --> 03:33.000]  So when he brags about his ratings, nobody's got ratings better than Trump.
[03:33.000 --> 03:39.000]  Mainstream media has gone straight down in the last decade, as everybody knows, they have a lower approval rating than even Congress at 7%.
[03:39.000 --> 03:41.000]  Congress has a 9%.
[03:41.000 --> 03:50.000]  Why is Trump the superstar going to go have a correspondence dinner set up by Ever Bernays 80-something years ago to make the media into superstars?
[03:50.000 --> 03:53.000]  He said, turn the media into burgeoning Hollywood.
[03:53.000 --> 03:55.000]  Mix it all together.
[03:55.000 --> 03:58.000]  Make corporate media superstars.
[03:58.000 --> 04:01.000]  And Trump's going to not make you superstars anymore.
[04:01.000 --> 04:09.000]  The public's already left you in droves, but your last little peacock events to go there when there's a president or somebody else that's somewhat popular,
[04:09.000 --> 04:14.000]  like Trump, super popular with the people, despite your fake polls,
[04:14.000 --> 04:19.000]  and he's there and he makes you look good and then you bitch about it.
[04:19.000 --> 04:22.000]  Good, you go to the correspondence dinner.
[04:22.000 --> 04:25.000]  And I don't think Spicer should be there.
[04:25.000 --> 04:28.000]  None of the White House, in fact, let's tweet Trump.
[04:28.000 --> 04:31.000]  Everyone should be barred from going.
[04:31.000 --> 04:38.000]  You know, the president's not authoritarian, so I guess if people in the White House get in the invite and they want to go, you go peacock around.
[04:38.000 --> 04:45.000]  But who wants to hang around with Benedict Arnold and Joseph Goebbels and Judas Iscariot?
[04:45.000 --> 04:54.000]  I mean, you better have some big money to pay me to go to that thing and hang around with a bunch of mummies with no ratings and a bunch of narcissists to sell out scumbags.
[04:54.000 --> 05:17.000]  No, this is big. You can put a fork in them, they're done.
[05:24.000 --> 05:38.000]  We have to ask ourselves how safe is our country when we have shadow elements in various intelligence agencies with holding information from the president that could be pertinent to him being able to make fast decisions in regard to the safety of the nation.
[05:38.000 --> 05:43.000]  And lastly, given the history of nefarious conduct by various intelligence agencies,
[05:43.000 --> 05:56.000]  would Trump make an executive order within constitutional restrictions to drain the swamp within the intelligence agencies before they enact a coup against him which would undermine the American democratic process?
[05:56.000 --> 06:13.000]  We are on the March. The Empire is on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[06:26.000 --> 06:46.000]  Stick a fork in the corporate dinosaur media. You can really see that Trump is the tombstone of mainstream dinosaur fake stream media.
[06:46.000 --> 07:00.000]  And with his latest announcements that he's not attending the White House press corps event, that he won't attend the correspondence dinner announcing that he just won't always out of hand let CNN and the New York Times into press briefing.
[07:00.000 --> 07:06.000]  Sometimes there's other groups that haven't been allowed in that are trying to get in. He's going to let them in. You're not God.
[07:06.000 --> 07:12.000]  There are 14 year old YouTubers that have more viewers every day than all of CNN combined.
[07:12.000 --> 07:21.000]  We certainly have more viewers and listeners here every week on average and CNN does. They are a complete hoax.
[07:21.000 --> 07:30.000]  And so Trump says you want to have CNN. You want to have the Washington Post Newsweek Time Magazine all calling for civil insurrection overthrow murder of the president.
[07:30.000 --> 07:39.000]  You want to boycott and financially block anybody on YouTube or Google or Facebook trying to promote the president's ideas and bringing our jobs back.
[07:39.000 --> 07:52.000]  Well, the president's going to start blocking you bullies. We're only calling for his death. We're only calling him a Nazi. We're only lying about him when he says fake news is the enemy of the American people.
[07:52.000 --> 07:59.000]  They come out and say that you hear President Trump says all media and questioning him as the enemy. That's how a dictator talks.
[07:59.000 --> 08:08.000]  And Trump gives a speech and goes I didn't do that. I said fake news is the enemy and that's my free speech. You're calling for me to be killed.
[08:08.000 --> 08:18.000]  But I'm supposed to not even say anything about you. So this is simply amazing. Meanwhile, on Friday and Saturday, it was in the New York Times.
[08:18.000 --> 08:35.000]  It was in Rolling Stone. It was in everywhere. Black magic rituals with Hollywood people and music folks calling for the death of Trump and doing a voodoo spell stabbing dolls and other effigies of Trump hoping to kill him last night.
[08:35.000 --> 08:45.000]  How Donald Trump is making witches and Christians fight again. Funny, that's their headline. Actually Rolling Stone yesterday had the headline different.
[08:45.000 --> 08:51.000]  It's actually over there in my other studio, other office. Josh has got it. I think they changed the headline. It was do a spell against Trump.
[08:51.000 --> 08:58.000]  And they said they're calling on the dark forces of Satan to kill him. Witches around the world plot mass spell against Trump.
[08:58.000 --> 09:09.000]  So I've always told you that at the bottom of the left is occultism and a lot of my research sex abuse and they continue to get caught doing it.
[09:09.000 --> 09:17.000]  And clear evidence of it is in the WikiLeaks. And you look at Wiener on the child porn charges. We told you that was coming three months ago.
[09:17.000 --> 09:23.000]  Now it's in the news. We told you there'd be pedophile roundups around the country. Those are now happening by the thousands.
[09:23.000 --> 09:30.000]  So there's this whole underbelly. But then when we say Hillary was a witch, she was admittedly a witch. Hillary was into black magic.
[09:30.000 --> 09:34.000]  You know, they're saying we call on dark powers to go after Trump.
[09:34.000 --> 09:40.000]  Whether you believe in that or not, they're doing this. Kind of their own ghost dance.
[09:40.000 --> 09:52.000]  So where are the apologies to me again telling you that we're dealing with people that are doing the spirit cooking and all the rest of stuff that Podesta goes to.
[09:52.000 --> 09:56.000]  Where they've got listed on the menu, blood, semen.
[09:56.000 --> 10:02.000]  Epigies of children being sacrificed. People's and vats of blood. Children are brought to these events.
[10:02.000 --> 10:15.000]  There's photos that they put out themselves of little kids at night at these meetings while they're doing, quote, simulated Satan rituals. They call art.
[10:15.000 --> 10:21.000]  In fact, again, it's over in my stack. And there's actually some of the articles where it talks about, you know, like, you know, they're calling on the forces of darkness, of hell,
[10:21.000 --> 10:28.000]  to kill Trump. They want to turn him into ashes. You can pull that up yourself. So that's what's going on here.
[10:28.000 --> 10:34.000]  And then Trump, with the mainstream media calling for his death, his assassination, Newsweek calling for a time to riot.
[10:34.000 --> 10:41.000]  The Soros funding group saying, bang, bang, you know, cops dead, oink, oink, bang, bang, you're dead. Time to kill cops.
[10:41.000 --> 10:48.000]  All this craziness going on. People being beat up to try to go to Trump events in private, you know, facilities or in college facilities.
[10:48.000 --> 11:00.000]  That's all okay. Calling for punching people that are Trump supporters. Violence is okay because we're the anointed bullies that tell you what words to use and what you can do and what you can say.
[11:00.000 --> 11:10.000]  And then Trump says, fine, I'm not going to the White House Correspondence Dinner. I'm boycotting you. You're boycotting me, fine. And they freak out.
[11:10.000 --> 11:20.000]  Then they freak out and say, oh, we're the mainstream media. We control reality. We don't have the ratings. People don't trust us. We have a 7% of brutal rating. It doesn't matter.
[11:20.000 --> 11:26.000]  You must bow down to us. You must give in to us. You must submit to us because we're almighty.
[11:26.000 --> 11:39.000]  And Trump, again, is only delivering on what he said he would do, shaying no to all of this. But again, we really should pray for President Trump because, as I've told you, it's a cultism.
[11:39.000 --> 11:55.000]  The whole globalist system, their whole program is about being anti-God, anti-Christian, anti-family. Everything they do is exclusionary to the normal life force of men and women together, creating children and having a world together.
[11:55.000 --> 12:01.000]  It is a systematic system of failure and death that they're pushing.
[12:01.000 --> 12:10.000]  So let's get into some of these articles. Trump says he will not attend White House Correspondence Dinner. He tweeted, I will not be attending the White House Correspondence Association Dinner this year.
[12:10.000 --> 12:20.000]  Please wish everyone a great evening. Please wish everyone well and a great evening.
[12:20.000 --> 12:31.000]  Isn't that just cute? So that's what this is all about. They want to boycott him. They want to call for his death. Then he calls them fake canoes when they lie about him.
[12:31.000 --> 12:36.000]  And they only intensify on what they're doing. They won't have any ratings unless Trump goes.
[12:36.000 --> 12:47.000]  Trump's the reason they admit that CNN's gone from almost no viewers to a little bit. And every other major outlet admits that Trump gives them huge, huge ratings.
[12:47.000 --> 12:59.000]  So if he doesn't go, and if he doesn't give them the exclusive at the event, and if he doesn't go on their channels, it's game over. They need him. Not the way around.
[12:59.000 --> 13:04.000]  We don't need the globalist. We don't need these people lecturing us down their noses all day.
[13:04.000 --> 13:11.000]  White House blocks CNN, New York Times for press briefings, hours after Trump slams media, Washington Post.
[13:11.000 --> 13:17.000]  They go on to say, oh, we're not going to go to the White House now in solidarity with the other media that's been banned.
[13:17.000 --> 13:25.000]  No, they just said, you don't get into the press briefing this time. We're going to let some other folks in that there's never room for who are accredited.
[13:25.000 --> 13:40.000]  Oh, we just don't get everything automatically when Jeff Bezos owns the Washington Post and got $600 million last year and $600 million budgeted this year by Obama from the CIA to fund the Washington Post.
[13:40.000 --> 13:47.000]  There should be congressional hearings. Obama passed the law three years ago that the CIA could fund domestic media.
[13:47.000 --> 13:50.000]  Well, I don't care if Obama said it was legal to do that. It shouldn't be.
[13:50.000 --> 13:56.000]  Just like Obama said he would just let illegals come across with diseases and not even test them or let felons in.
[13:56.000 --> 14:02.000]  Well, he's a criminal. He's gone. He's out of office now.
[14:02.000 --> 14:08.000]  So every other country has laws and has visas and has rules. We're going to have them. Oh my gosh.
[14:08.000 --> 14:15.000]  Fake news media outlets CNN, New York Times, Buzzfeed not invited a White House presser. They call it being banned.
[14:15.000 --> 14:21.000]  No, they just didn't get into this one. Woodward press shouldn't whine. Not in media's interest to have war with Trump.
[14:21.000 --> 14:25.000]  We should continue investigations. You have to bring him down with made up crap.
[14:25.000 --> 14:35.000]  House Democrats plan to troll Trump at big speech. Remember the one guy during an inauguration or during a state of the union said you lie.
[14:35.000 --> 14:44.000]  And the whole media said how dare him when Obama said that he wasn't opening the borders, that Obamacare was free and a bunch of other crap.
[14:44.000 --> 14:50.000]  The congressman said you lie. Well, now they're saying, oh, this is good. Politico.
[14:50.000 --> 15:01.000]  House Democrats plan to troll Trump at big speech. Lawmakers are inviting dreamers, Muslim Americans and others to join a dress before Congress this Tuesday.
[15:01.000 --> 15:06.000]  Let's carry it live here. I'll have commentary. We'll be covering it live.
[15:06.000 --> 15:14.000]  Father of Seals laid in Yemen calls for investigation. So Trump promises to go after these bases that Obama had targeted but then blocked.
[15:14.000 --> 15:20.000]  A seal gets killed and the dad comes out. So now Trump's bad fulfilling another promise to go after Al Qaeda and ISIS.
[15:20.000 --> 15:27.000]  That's the way this all works. So we're going to be breaking more of this down after we come back from break.
[15:27.000 --> 15:33.000]  It's time to boycott them. They want to boycott America. They want to try to bully us into submission.
[15:33.000 --> 15:39.000]  It's time to say to the globalist, we're done with Hollywood. We're done with the Oscars. We're done with all your stinking garbage.
[15:39.000 --> 15:45.000]  We're done with your public schools. If they're federally and globalist run, we're breaking away from you. And guess what?
[15:45.000 --> 15:53.000]  We're the producers. We're the workers. We're the inventors. We're the strivers. And we're going to make America great again.
[15:53.000 --> 15:58.000]  So if you don't want to surround you, that's great. You'll collapse vampires.
[15:58.000 --> 16:03.000]  We have the new product in enforce life dot com bio true selenium.
[16:03.000 --> 16:14.000]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium and just recently we were able to source a certified organic bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[16:14.000 --> 16:23.000]  If you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body. It helps balance the thyroid gland. It helps detoxify.
[16:23.000 --> 16:26.000]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must haves.
[16:26.000 --> 16:31.000]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[16:31.000 --> 16:37.000]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium.
[16:37.000 --> 16:45.000]  So it really is a all around nutrient that everybody really needs. I'm taking it now every day. This is so key.
[16:45.000 --> 16:49.000]  Bio true selenium is the product, the best selenium that we could bring.
[16:49.000 --> 16:51.000]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[16:51.000 --> 16:57.000]  Exclusively available at infowarslife.com or by calling toll free triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.

[18:25.000 --> 18:31.000]  We drill down more than 7,000 feet to gather these purple-blue crystals to extract the ultra-pure iodine.
[18:31.000 --> 18:35.000]  On top of that, we also screen our iodine for radiation before bottling.
[18:35.000 --> 18:38.000]  It is the purest, cleanest, strongest out there.
[18:38.000 --> 18:42.000]  Quite frankly, I'm flattered that with the launch of Survival Shield, nascent iodine,
[18:42.000 --> 18:51.000]  that major brands and major companies have been knocking down our doors to get our formula and that they have been unable to come up with anything even close to what we have.
[18:51.000 --> 18:58.000]  It is exclusive to infowarslife.com and the infowarslife family of incredible products.
[18:58.000 --> 19:07.000]  Today we call it bone broth and for thousands of years our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became a loss to our modern diet of processed junk.
[19:07.000 --> 19:10.000]  We are now introducing Caveman by infowarslife.com.
[19:10.000 --> 19:20.000]  The ultimate and true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, shaga mushroom and 7 total primal superfoods in a single great tasting formula.
[19:20.000 --> 19:28.000]  Caveman is those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors and we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[19:28.000 --> 19:36.000]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal. You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[19:36.000 --> 19:44.000]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[19:44.000 --> 19:52.000]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were and this is a big part of it.
[19:52.000 --> 20:14.000]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman ultimate paleo formula for yourself at infowarslife.com today.
[20:14.000 --> 20:24.000]  You thought the lead in winter would bring you down forever, but you rode upon a steamer to the violence of the sun.
[20:24.000 --> 20:33.000]  Broadcasting live from the UN stronghold Austin, Texas, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:33.000 --> 20:44.000]  That's right, we're not really saying from deep behind enemy lines anymore because we're recapturing the country.
[20:44.000 --> 20:56.000]  But I do come to you from a model UN city, the number one in the world, their own admission of putting people in 200 square foot apartments, getting rid of cars, breaking up families, banning shingle family dwellings,
[20:56.000 --> 21:12.000]  code next is what they call it or agenda 2030. And it's just amazing, you know, my ancestors helped found the state and this county and now I've got all the brainwashed poor Californians and other slaves that literally look at Texans like we shouldn't be here.
[21:12.000 --> 21:16.000]  I mean, it's amazing. It is absolutely amazing.
[21:16.000 --> 21:27.000]  Now Trump's calling for the biggest rally ever of his supporters just to put the idea out there and they're saying obviously go to town halls, be politically engaged, pray for America. The fight has just begun.
[21:27.000 --> 21:36.000]  Because the Soros groups and others are really pushing to bully people at town hall meetings, city council meetings, state house meetings and all over the country.
[21:36.000 --> 21:38.000]  We have these videos.
[21:38.000 --> 21:51.000]  They're up on infowars.com. They chant hail Satan, hail Lucifer. And again, they're doing all this witchcraft against the president, all this basically mental illness, according to their whole atheist views.
[21:51.000 --> 22:00.000]  But I found that atheists themselves, when you talk about a political philosophy at the top, are a cultist that don't want the public aware of how the system actually operates.
[22:00.000 --> 22:08.000]  But regardless, you never see the atheists criticizing all the crazy Satanists and Luciferians running around.
[22:08.000 --> 22:27.000]  No, no, no. They're only criticizing Trump for invoking the birthright and God and Jesus Christ. Remember, CNN's Jake Tapper calls Trump inaugural speech one of the most radical because he invoked the birthright and God and providence and destiny.
[22:27.000 --> 22:40.000]  This is Rolling Stone, you know, with the witches and the occult and mass spell against Trump, hoping he dies. Good witch, Lain Adele Ray, participates in casting a spell against Trump.
[22:40.000 --> 22:43.000]  Good witches did black magic.
[22:43.000 --> 22:58.000]  So again, this is all going on and they're freaking out and oh, Melania, she had the Lord's Prayer. This is horrible. Separation search in state. If a president's Christian, that's their right. You don't have a state-run religion forcing you to practice one.
[22:58.000 --> 23:07.000]  But political correctness and breaking up our families and being globalist, that is the new religion. And how many times have I told you?
[23:07.000 --> 23:18.000]  Most of the anti-American folks, most of the pro-abortion people that are really hard-cored into it will tell you, I'm not just into people having their right to abortion. I like it. It's I love it.
[23:18.000 --> 23:28.000]  All the big top feminists wear shirts saying, I had an abortion. I'm proud of it. We've played the clips where they say, I went and got one. I got pregnant. Just to have one, it's so loving.
[23:28.000 --> 23:42.000]  It's about being sick. ISIS just put out videos of puppies with bombs tied to them and said, look, we blow up puppies. We want to be bad. It's like the communists attacking a cat sanctuary in Austin to run it out of the East Austin.
[23:42.000 --> 23:51.000]  It's about being nasty. It's about being evil. If you study history, you learn where all this comes from. And that's what they hate about it so much.
[23:51.000 --> 24:00.000]  So let's go ahead and go to some of these clips. This is Trump at CPAC a few days ago. Not afraid to mention God, then President Trump at the inauguration.
[24:00.000 --> 24:11.000]  And then First Lady recites the Lord's Prayer. This is what they hate. But when they do this, it's horrible. It's evil. It's bad. It's the worst thing in the world.
[24:11.000 --> 24:23.000]  But when, oh, you promote witchcraft and Satanism and Luciferianism everywhere, that's okay. And it's a bunch of spoiled brats declaring they hate prosperity and God's natural order.
[24:23.000 --> 24:33.000]  Well, if they want to go off and be losers and failures, I'm into freedom. So is God. Do what you want. As Alistair Crowley says, you know, you got right. You got free will.
[24:33.000 --> 24:41.000]  I love how Crowley acts like he invented the idea of you got your own free will. You know, do as I will. Yeah, do as I will. But pay the consequences of your action.
[24:41.000 --> 24:50.000]  You know, drink a gallon of vodka today and die of liver failure. Smoke six packets of cigarettes every few days. Die of lung cancer. Hey, we live in a free society.
[24:50.000 --> 24:58.000]  But don't make us adopt what you do that's destroying you. Believe me, I don't say that from some high horse. I just understand natural law.
[24:58.000 --> 25:02.000]  So let's go ahead. Trump, not afraid to mention God.
[25:02.000 --> 25:15.000]  We all salute with pride, the same American flag, and we all are equal, totally equal unification in the eyes of Almighty God.
[25:15.000 --> 25:21.000]  We're equal. Unification.
[25:21.000 --> 25:26.000]  If you want to be unified.
[25:26.000 --> 25:35.000]  Oh, God, whatever. Oh, but let's devil worship all day. Let's sexualize children. That's the religions ruling innocence. Satanist worldwide have always been ruling innocence.
[25:35.000 --> 25:53.000]  I want to thank, by the way, the evangelical community, the Christian community, communities of faith, rabbis and priests and pastors, ministers,
[25:53.000 --> 26:05.000]  because the support for me was a record, as you know, not only in terms of numbers of people, but percentages of those numbers that voted for Trump.
[26:05.000 --> 26:06.000]  And it's a spirit.
[26:06.000 --> 26:24.000]  I want to thank you folks. I was amazing and amazing outpouring, and I will not disappoint you. As long as we have faith in each other and trusted God, then there is no goal at all beyond our reach.
[26:24.000 --> 26:29.000]  There is no dream too large, no task too great.
[26:29.000 --> 26:44.000]  We are Americans and the future belongs to us. The future belongs to all of you and America is coming about and it's coming back and it's roaring and you can hear it.
[26:44.000 --> 26:46.000]  It's going to be bigger and better.
[26:46.000 --> 27:01.000]  It is going to be. It is going to be. Remember, and it's roaring. It's going to be bigger and better and stronger than ever before.
[27:01.000 --> 27:11.000]  Trump's got incredible will. He is speaking that into existence, but it isn't some magic. We have the base to do it. We have the both right. We're in. If we take it back, he knows it.
[27:11.000 --> 27:29.000]  I want to thank you and Matt and Mercedes. I want to thank the two of you and all of the supporters that I have. I see them. They're all over the place. You are really great people. I want to thank you.
[27:29.000 --> 27:37.000]  And I want to say to you, God bless you and God bless the United States of America. Thank you.
[27:37.000 --> 27:44.000]  Now, again, Hillary never once got used. He took American flags down during their convention because they lost. She's now saying God bless too.
[27:44.000 --> 27:50.000]  So when the devil thought he had you be, he took his mask off. Now that he knows you're awake, he puts the little Jesus mask back on.
[27:50.000 --> 28:01.000]  The difference is, Judge Trump buys fruits, small businesses exploding, stock market exploding. Everything happening. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's cue it back up and just play the part when Hillary says God bless you.
[28:01.000 --> 28:13.000]  I'm going to come back and play Milani and other clips. And what's more important was his inaugural where he called in the birthright, the destiny and ask God back in. That was key.
[28:13.000 --> 28:22.000]  Because if you reject God, God didn't like the devil or the spirit of oppression. Whether you call it energy, wavelengths, whatever. I want to get new age you with people. This is real, though.
[28:22.000 --> 28:34.000]  In every culture they know you call on dark, evil forces. It comes, but it's destructive and it's bad for you as well. You call on God and you mean it with a good heart. God will deliver.
[28:34.000 --> 28:36.000]  Let's go out with Hillary. Here she is.
[28:36.000 --> 28:42.000]  Three step of the way. God bless you and God bless America.
[28:42.000 --> 28:53.000]  Never heard that from her in decades. You hear it now because she must now be the counterfeit Christ. We'll be back.
[29:13.000 --> 29:23.000]  Obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease and autoimmune illnesses are rampant. One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.

[33:34.000 --> 33:37.000]  Clone.
[33:37.000 --> 33:42.000]  Hitler took the guns, Stalin took the guns, Mal took the guns, and El Castro took the guns.
[33:42.000 --> 33:45.000]  You know Chavez took the guns.
[33:45.000 --> 33:51.000]  1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms.
[33:51.000 --> 33:56.000]  The Republic will rise again when you attempt to take our guns.
[33:56.000 --> 34:08.000]  I am sworn upon the altar of God, internal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[34:08.000 --> 34:20.000]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[34:20.000 --> 34:27.000]  My gut's never wrong and my gut told me Donald Trump's for real, not perfect, but he's not out to get us.
[34:27.000 --> 34:30.000]  He understands Americana. He understands the globalist.
[34:30.000 --> 34:36.000]  He really is the David versus Goliath. He seems as a billionaire. He's up against globalists in trillions.
[34:36.000 --> 34:42.000]  But I couldn't believe my gut was right for the first year I was supporting him, but I just had to go with my gut.
[34:42.000 --> 34:46.000]  When I was younger, I wouldn't go with my gut. And as I get older, it says gut, gut, gut, gut, gut, gut.
[34:46.000 --> 34:52.000]  I didn't intellectually analyze everything, but I guess wisdom is learning to go with your gut.
[34:52.000 --> 34:57.000]  And I was during the break watching clips of a C-pack speech that we aired during the breaks for TV viewers.
[34:57.000 --> 35:05.000]  And I was just like back there with Darren McBreen and Josh Owens that are so driven, without me even asking, they're up here working seven days a week,
[35:05.000 --> 35:10.000]  even though they both got wives and girlfriends.
[35:10.000 --> 35:17.000]  And it's just because as a real man, normal men would be watching a football game, which is simulated war on Sunday night,
[35:17.000 --> 35:22.000]  because men are supposed to be in business and life and involved and in councils of the village,
[35:22.000 --> 35:24.000]  because there's always some other village that wants to raid you.
[35:24.000 --> 35:30.000]  And men are supposed to be tracking things and learning, and should we move out of this area or should we build a fortress?
[35:30.000 --> 35:34.000]  That's what men do. If men don't do that, they're not even seen as manly.
[35:34.000 --> 35:38.000]  But real men don't have to be told to do it.
[35:38.000 --> 35:41.000]  That's what this is.
[35:41.000 --> 35:47.000]  And I'm up here saying, I'm some real man. I'm just telling you, I'm not one of these zombies that's going to roll over to a bunch of terrain.
[35:47.000 --> 35:51.000]  And I see Trump, and I just said, you know, they're going to make fun of this, and I don't care. It's the truth.
[35:51.000 --> 35:56.000]  All I can say is the truth. I love Donald Trump. I love him. I love him.
[35:56.000 --> 36:00.000]  I realize that watching him back there, I just love him.
[36:00.000 --> 36:05.000]  I mean, all I do is study how the economy really works and interview top economists as you know.
[36:05.000 --> 36:09.000]  Nobel Prize winners in economics. We've interviewed like five of them.
[36:09.000 --> 36:16.000]  All I do is study stuff and the globalist own writings and everything they were doing was admittedly to hurt western industrialized nations,
[36:16.000 --> 36:21.000]  not to help third world, but to exploit us and exploit them.
[36:21.000 --> 36:23.000]  And they brag about it.
[36:23.000 --> 36:28.000]  That's their undoing is they're so uncool. They've talked about it at nauseam.
[36:28.000 --> 36:32.000]  How their tax exempt 100 trillion every decade they want in carbon taxes.
[36:32.000 --> 36:41.000]  And just to see Trump who's not out to get us is incredible.
[36:41.000 --> 36:45.000]  He's so confident that he wants you to succeed as well.
[36:45.000 --> 36:47.000]  And that's how I've always been my whole life.
[36:47.000 --> 36:56.000]  And there's not a lot of men in positions of power that are like that because most men are almost humble because they're strong.
[36:56.000 --> 37:00.000]  And so they don't go out and become dominant because it seems that there's a governor.
[37:00.000 --> 37:08.000]  When you're like super aggressive and have all the attack genes and all the programming and all the genetic background to go out and do that,
[37:08.000 --> 37:10.000]  there's a governor and you don't do it.
[37:10.000 --> 37:13.000]  But see little scumbags, they don't have that governor.
[37:13.000 --> 37:17.000]  They're out running around trying to dominate and control because that's their nature.
[37:17.000 --> 37:20.000]  And then we sit here like sleeping giants and let them run all over us.
[37:20.000 --> 37:22.000]  That has to come to a stop.
[37:22.000 --> 37:24.000]  It doesn't mean we won't make mistakes. We won't get in rages.
[37:24.000 --> 37:29.000]  We won't commit sins, but we don't want to. We want to be good.
[37:29.000 --> 37:43.000]  And I mean, I'm telling you, I have studied Trump and he is right on everything but the surveillance state and everything but torture.
[37:43.000 --> 37:47.000]  And he's backed off on torture because he knows they do it out of hand.
[37:47.000 --> 37:48.000]  It's been going on forever.
[37:48.000 --> 37:49.000]  He thinks, well, we're good.
[37:49.000 --> 37:51.000]  We'll only torture the bad guys when he's been convinced by madness.
[37:51.000 --> 37:52.000]  It's not good.
[37:52.000 --> 37:53.000]  He's backed off that.
[37:53.000 --> 37:57.000]  He understands more and more now that, no, the NSA is being used to spy on you, sir.
[37:57.000 --> 37:59.000]  Now he's even, he's got a few areas.
[37:59.000 --> 38:01.000]  He's not been very computer technical.
[38:01.000 --> 38:14.000]  He has like idiot, savant, regular people skills and knows how to read people and knows how to have incredible mega level charisma in person.
[38:14.000 --> 38:19.000]  And as people realize that that's why every evil force out there hates Trump because he's good.
[38:19.000 --> 38:21.000]  He is good.
[38:21.000 --> 38:26.000]  He's not one of these fake Christian Pharisees that tells you how good they are all day or tells you you should know, you know,
[38:26.000 --> 38:30.000]  stubbed your toe and said the, you know, GD or whatever.
[38:30.000 --> 38:31.000]  God judges the heart.
[38:31.000 --> 38:32.000]  Okay.
[38:32.000 --> 38:35.000]  I admit I do a lot of bad things and I repent for it.
[38:35.000 --> 38:36.000]  I'm weak in the flesh.
[38:36.000 --> 38:40.000]  I constantly do stuff that's bad, but I'm trying not to is the difference.
[38:40.000 --> 38:42.000]  And I love God and I want justice.
[38:42.000 --> 38:43.000]  I'm not a coward.
[38:43.000 --> 38:49.000]  And God hates cowards and people that hurt innocence and that abuse those that are weaker than them more than anybody.
[38:49.000 --> 38:51.000]  Have you read the scriptures?
[38:51.000 --> 38:55.000]  So all you fakes want to get close to God, stop being cowards.
[38:55.000 --> 38:57.000]  Be like Donald Trump.
[38:57.000 --> 38:59.000]  Be like Matt Drudge.
[38:59.000 --> 39:04.000]  Be like people that get attacked and demonized and make it through it and get stronger on the other side.
[39:04.000 --> 39:11.000]  Don't be like all these little commentators and scumbags that hedge their bets when we are literally approaching the gooder.
[39:11.000 --> 39:12.000]  Dama wrong.
[39:12.000 --> 39:16.000]  If things go south and that's the battle of the gods.
[39:16.000 --> 39:21.000]  That's the twilight of the age.
[39:21.000 --> 39:24.000]  Make no mistake, ladies and gentlemen, we are in a critical juncture.
[39:24.000 --> 39:29.000]  The most critical juncture our species has ever seen.
[39:29.000 --> 39:36.000]  And that which raises her head on the day that she publicly supports witchcraft and Satanism and black magic.
[39:36.000 --> 39:40.000]  They were in the news saying hope Trump dies voodoo dolls.
[39:40.000 --> 39:41.000]  Have you seen what happened to Haiti?
[39:41.000 --> 39:45.000]  What happened in New Orleans voodoo and devil worship?
[39:45.000 --> 39:46.000]  It is funny.
[39:46.000 --> 39:53.000]  They have devil worship in Africa even before they ever heard from Christians and China had devil worship and the Aztecs had devil worship.
[39:53.000 --> 39:55.000]  Because it's real, folks.
[39:55.000 --> 39:56.000]  It's an archetype.
[39:56.000 --> 39:57.000]  Either way, you cut it.
[39:57.000 --> 39:58.000]  It's a spirit.
[39:58.000 --> 40:10.000]  And any time a culture starts invoking Satan, every time it happens, there are mass wars, casualties and death.
[40:10.000 --> 40:14.000]  And only corrupt, twisted, weak societies ever call on Satan.
[40:14.000 --> 40:23.000]  Any strong society always calls on the great spirit as some Native Americans called it.
[40:23.000 --> 40:25.000]  We're talking about the same thing in my view.
[40:25.000 --> 40:33.000]  We're talking about God that created the heavens and the earth and everything else and the four seasons and men and women and this whole planet to test us out.
[40:33.000 --> 40:39.000]  So I want to play a few more clips here where we take calls in the second hour, play a lot of other important special reports.
[40:39.000 --> 40:50.000]  But you see the open enemy, Satanism, saying you don't hand out Christmas cards at school, but we can have a Satanism club or whatever.
[40:50.000 --> 40:53.000]  You understand?
[40:53.000 --> 40:58.000]  They're saying that to bully, you have a first event right to have a Christmas tree or lights.
[40:58.000 --> 41:00.000]  And again, that's Germanic.
[41:00.000 --> 41:06.000]  And by the way, I don't want to say everybody that has Germanic roots who are never even touched by the message of Christ that you're Satanic.
[41:06.000 --> 41:22.000]  There's the light and there's the dark and then Christ is a greater fulfillment of that and pulling humanity out of sin now that we could be delivered in a more sure, direct, pure way.
[41:22.000 --> 41:28.000]  But just because, see, they lie and they say, oh, any other culture, any other religion, oh, you're going to hell if you don't follow this.
[41:28.000 --> 41:37.000]  That's another globalist system to make sure people are insulted by that and then basically never actually discover Christ.
[41:37.000 --> 41:52.000]  But if you go back to all the archetypes of, say, the Germans or other cultures, it's all the same archetypes, the same players, the evil one and the big good God that created it all, that gave you life and wants you to produce and be successful and fulfilled and transcend.
[41:52.000 --> 41:58.000]  And then the evil God that's not a God that wants to be God that wants to pull down humanity because it's God's creation.
[41:58.000 --> 42:01.000]  It's the same in every culture.
[42:01.000 --> 42:11.000]  Humans know this and it is a psychological spiritual virus that has been injected into our species to destroy us.
[42:11.000 --> 42:32.000]  So let's go out to break again with Hillary, invoking God would never do this in her decades of politics, but wouldn't do it during her DNC, but doing it now because she's scared that Trump is bringing God back in and Jesus Christ back in and the birthright back in and unifying us in that love.
[42:32.000 --> 42:47.000]  So now they're having to try to reorganize their people and saying, God bless, because she knows a good portion of Democrats are actually Christians and are understanding what Trump's doing and will actually repent and join Trump and our movement to fight the satanic system.
[42:47.000 --> 42:54.000]  And so that's why Hillary's now invoking God bless America because she knows she wants to destroy America.
[42:54.000 --> 43:03.000]  Stay with us, I'm Alex Jones, M4Wars.com.
[43:03.000 --> 43:06.000]  Charlie Daniels, he's always loved America.
[43:06.000 --> 43:15.000]  Let me just read a little thing. The American system of justice must be changed to conform to the rest of the world. Individual rights will have to take a back seat to the collective.
[43:15.000 --> 43:18.000]  Well, you know what the next move is going to be, don't you? It's going to be coming after your guns.
[43:18.000 --> 43:19.000]  Oh, yeah.
[43:19.000 --> 43:24.000]  It ain't going to sit well down my way at all. It ain't going to sit well.
[43:24.000 --> 43:29.000]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America? They lost. We won. We want to see what Trump's up against.
[43:29.000 --> 43:32.000]  It's time to ride, boys. We need a thousand paul with ears.
[43:32.000 --> 43:38.000]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie.
[43:38.000 --> 43:51.000]  And beef was for supper. Revelation, dawn of global government, theatrical screenings on demand, DVDs now available, starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, Special Ops General, Jerry Boykin.
[43:51.000 --> 43:58.000]  Want to shed some tears over the red, white and blue? Revelation, the movie.info. Let's fix it.
[43:58.000 --> 44:05.000]  It's not just our water we need to filter. It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned. It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[44:05.000 --> 44:11.000]  The artificial particulates of the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[44:11.000 --> 44:20.000]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze.
[44:20.000 --> 44:28.000]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children, to the best job you can to purify your air.
[44:28.000 --> 44:36.000]  We beat our masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most toxic effects for themselves.
[44:36.000 --> 44:38.000]  The general public doesn't.
[44:38.000 --> 44:46.000]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500. One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[44:46.000 --> 44:52.000]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[44:52.000 --> 44:59.000]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWarsStore.com.

[46:54.000 --> 46:59.000]  And all out-of-stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for auto-ship.
[46:59.000 --> 47:10.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[47:10.000 --> 47:29.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[47:29.000 --> 47:33.000]  Well, I should have Trump delivered on 30-40% of what he said he would do.
[47:33.000 --> 47:36.000]  And as he tried to get it through, he'd be greater than Ronald Reagan ever was.
[47:36.000 --> 47:39.000]  He's already greater than Ronald Reagan ever was.
[47:39.000 --> 47:40.000]  Ronald Reagan meant well.
[47:40.000 --> 47:41.000]  He was an anti-globalist early on.
[47:41.000 --> 47:42.000]  They shot him.
[47:42.000 --> 47:43.000]  They kind of controlled him.
[47:43.000 --> 47:46.000]  George Herbert Walker Bush came in and derailed America.
[47:46.000 --> 47:49.000]  And we know the rest of the next 30-plus years.
[47:49.000 --> 47:56.000]  But if you actually study what Trump's doing and how the economy is exploding while the big central banks try to block the economy growing,
[47:56.000 --> 48:03.000]  it's very, very frustrating and it makes me very, very angry to see these masses of people protesting Trump and saying,
[48:03.000 --> 48:09.000]  kill him when they're some of the most disenfranchised people under globalism.
[48:09.000 --> 48:17.000]  But it's this whole fake liberal pop culture thing where they've got everybody distracted on little football-side social issues that are never rectified
[48:17.000 --> 48:23.000]  while economically you're being gang-raped.
[48:23.000 --> 48:24.000]  It's amazing.
[48:24.000 --> 48:27.000]  I want to play some of these clips and then I want to get into Glenn Beck.
[48:27.000 --> 48:32.000]  And by the way, every time I talk about Glenn Beck, we can see on the computer feed where streams go down.
[48:32.000 --> 48:40.000]  Glenn Beck is so hated by my audience and libertarians and patriots and even liberals that no one will watch videos we post from the live show
[48:40.000 --> 48:41.000]  where I expose him.
[48:41.000 --> 48:46.000]  But it's important to understand what he represents, again, archetypally.
[48:46.000 --> 48:51.000]  So that's coming up where he says nationalism is scary and not conservative.
[48:51.000 --> 48:59.000]  Now, America is all about nationalism, all about not having foreign entanglements, and all about America first, any country is.
[48:59.000 --> 49:08.000]  Unless you're like a slave plantation or some colonial barony of some viceroy like India was out of the British for hundreds of years.
[49:08.000 --> 49:11.000]  I mean, imagine, we need to have jobs for Americans and do better trade deals.
[49:11.000 --> 49:12.000]  This is incredible.
[49:12.000 --> 49:17.000]  This is scary, CNN, Anderson Cooper.
[49:17.000 --> 49:18.000]  And it's the same message.
[49:18.000 --> 49:23.000]  It's like saying mother's milk is poison.
[49:23.000 --> 49:29.000]  And they sit there with these pseudo-intellectual glasses and little sweaters to look, you know, non-threatening.
[49:29.000 --> 49:30.000]  These are get ups.
[49:30.000 --> 49:31.000]  This is all an act.
[49:31.000 --> 49:34.000]  And we know it's an act because I'm going to be the big secret.
[49:34.000 --> 49:38.000]  Beck thought, you know, remind me to do it.
[49:38.000 --> 49:39.000]  I'm going to give it a minute.
[49:39.000 --> 49:40.000]  I'm going to give it a minute.
[49:40.000 --> 49:47.000]  Let me get back to God.
[49:47.000 --> 49:52.000]  God wants you to be prosperous and successful as long as it's not done on somebody else's back.
[49:52.000 --> 49:53.000]  This country did have a great providence.
[49:53.000 --> 49:54.000]  And that's what Americana is.
[49:54.000 --> 49:58.000]  And that's being re-invoked and called back into the world right now.
[49:58.000 --> 50:02.000]  As I tweeted before his speech, I said he's going to call on the birthright and bring God back in.
[50:02.000 --> 50:03.000]  I knew.
[50:03.000 --> 50:05.000]  And I told people around me.
[50:05.000 --> 50:07.000]  I started crying as I was walking in.
[50:07.000 --> 50:08.000]  They're like, are you going crazy?
[50:08.000 --> 50:10.000]  Roger Stone's like, okay, yeah.
[50:10.000 --> 50:11.000]  How do you know he's going to give that speech?
[50:11.000 --> 50:13.000]  And I said, watch.
[50:13.000 --> 50:15.000]  Had the New York Times run up after and say, how did you know that?
[50:15.000 --> 50:16.000]  Did you talk to him?
[50:16.000 --> 50:18.000]  And I said, no.
[50:18.000 --> 50:20.000]  I knew.
[50:20.000 --> 50:23.000]  Because my gut, my spirit already knows what Trump's going to do.
[50:23.000 --> 50:25.000]  And now it's crazy.
[50:25.000 --> 50:29.000]  I'll forget to say, hey, Trump, you ought to do this, which it isn't him getting it from me, but I'll forget.
[50:29.000 --> 50:32.000]  And then he still does it because it's what's common sense.
[50:32.000 --> 50:36.000]  Don't go to the correspondence dinner that's all about the president if they're going to attack you.
[50:36.000 --> 50:37.000]  You're not welcome at some party.
[50:37.000 --> 50:38.000]  Don't go.
[50:38.000 --> 50:39.000]  That's normal common sense.
[50:39.000 --> 50:42.000]  The mainstream media always hogs and has most of the spaces.
[50:42.000 --> 50:45.000]  And all this new media bigger than them can't come in.
[50:45.000 --> 50:46.000]  We'll rotate it.
[50:46.000 --> 50:48.000]  And sorry, you know, there wasn't room for you today.
[50:48.000 --> 50:49.000]  You'll get in next week.
[50:49.000 --> 50:52.000]  Then they go lie and say he kicked him out.
[50:52.000 --> 50:54.000]  It's just he just does common sense.
[50:54.000 --> 50:56.000]  This isn't rocket science, people.
[50:56.000 --> 51:00.000]  If China's got huge tariffs against us, we have done it against them until they renegotiate.
[51:00.000 --> 51:03.000]  Do something.
[51:03.000 --> 51:10.000]  If illegals fly in without visas or you catch somebody here, only in the first two weeks, they're here illegally.
[51:10.000 --> 51:12.000]  Or if they're a felon, is he kicking them out?
[51:12.000 --> 51:14.000]  And the media says, oh, everybody's scared.
[51:14.000 --> 51:17.000]  Women and children are running.
[51:17.000 --> 51:20.000]  And if you actually read what ICE is doing, it's not what they're doing.
[51:20.000 --> 51:21.000]  But it's just crazy.
[51:21.000 --> 51:25.000]  Mexico, again, I know people that have tried to stay in Cancun an extra week.
[51:25.000 --> 51:32.000]  And they call the hotel and say, Mr. Johnson or Mr. Sanchez or whatever it is, was supposed to fly out on Sunday.
[51:32.000 --> 51:34.000]  It's Friday.
[51:34.000 --> 51:35.000]  Let us call his room.
[51:35.000 --> 51:37.000]  And they send the news.
[51:37.000 --> 51:41.000]  They call your room and say, what in the hell are you doing?
[51:41.000 --> 51:43.000]  Come down here right now.
[51:43.000 --> 51:46.000]  If you lose the piece of paper, it's having people I know.
[51:46.000 --> 51:49.000]  What was the day when you're leaving and they will call you in.
[51:49.000 --> 51:52.000]  Sometimes they'll arrest you and target you because it's called a country.
[51:52.000 --> 51:57.000]  You have to do that.
[51:57.000 --> 51:59.000]  But here, just people flying, just skip everything.
[51:59.000 --> 52:00.000]  And they were ordered to do this by Obama.
[52:00.000 --> 52:01.000]  I mean, this is crazy.
[52:01.000 --> 52:05.000]  And they lie about Trump again.
[52:05.000 --> 52:09.000]  They lie, they lie, they lie.
[52:09.000 --> 52:13.000]  But getting back to the Christian issue, you have Hillary now saying, God bless America.
[52:13.000 --> 52:16.000]  And Trump's saying it because she knows.
[52:16.000 --> 52:19.000]  They tried to get God completely out, but their own constituents want God.
[52:19.000 --> 52:20.000]  They're hungry.
[52:20.000 --> 52:21.000]  So they're scared.
[52:21.000 --> 52:23.000]  They're saying, this is really getting traction with Democrats.
[52:23.000 --> 52:25.000]  Trump's like at 65 in Gallup and Rasmussen, folks.
[52:25.000 --> 52:27.000]  We know how the actuaries work.
[52:27.000 --> 52:28.000]  Internal polls have been done.
[52:28.000 --> 52:30.000]  They have big databases.
[52:30.000 --> 52:34.000]  You can even subscribe to Bloomberg and others that have access to these big databases.
[52:34.000 --> 52:37.000]  Why Bloomberg's made, you know, 40 something million dollars the last 20 years.
[52:37.000 --> 52:38.000]  They all wrote the real numbers.
[52:38.000 --> 52:42.000]  They knew Trump was winning by 15, 20 point margins, like I told you.
[52:42.000 --> 52:45.000]  But they told him he was going to lose by 10 points.
[52:45.000 --> 52:46.000]  But see, he didn't.
[52:46.000 --> 52:50.000]  Even though they stole a bunch of states, his victory was so big they couldn't.
[52:50.000 --> 52:54.000]  That's why all the bots and all the computer algorithms, remember those headlines?
[52:54.000 --> 52:58.000]  Actually, all our algorithms show Trump's way ahead like 15, 20 points.
[52:58.000 --> 53:00.000]  Oh, well, don't listen to those.
[53:00.000 --> 53:05.000]  Our polls show he's 10 points behind or 20 points behind.
[53:05.000 --> 53:07.000]  CNN had him 40 points behind.
[53:07.000 --> 53:10.000]  Who believes that?
[53:10.000 --> 53:14.000]  But again, it's this perception of Trump's not popular.
[53:14.000 --> 53:17.000]  The economy's not doing well except small businesses the best since 1984.
[53:17.000 --> 53:19.000]  They're trying to suppress that.
[53:19.000 --> 53:22.000]  And then Glenn Beck comes out and says, there's something very that scares me.
[53:22.000 --> 53:24.000]  They're talking about nationalism.
[53:24.000 --> 53:25.000]  That's not conservative.
[53:25.000 --> 53:28.000]  It's not conservative to have a country.
[53:28.000 --> 53:33.000]  It's not conservative to try to do good trade deals.
[53:33.000 --> 53:36.000]  What the hell are you talking about?
[53:36.000 --> 53:40.000]  But again, he's lost it with his viewers and listenership.
[53:40.000 --> 53:41.000]  He's gone.
[53:41.000 --> 53:42.000]  He's a joke.
[53:42.000 --> 53:43.000]  He's a facade.
[53:43.000 --> 53:47.000]  But I just mentioned him to show what scum of the earth is.
[53:47.000 --> 53:48.000]  But let's go back to Hillary.
[53:48.000 --> 53:50.000]  Here she is saying, God bless America.
[53:50.000 --> 53:54.000]  God bless you and God bless America.
[53:54.000 --> 53:57.000]  And I'm surprised you didn't have smoke coming out of her ears for that.
[53:57.000 --> 54:00.000]  OK, now let's go ahead now and play this clip.
[54:00.000 --> 54:02.000]  President Donald Trump inauguration.
[54:02.000 --> 54:03.000]  We will be protected by God.
[54:03.000 --> 54:04.000]  Here it is.
[54:04.000 --> 54:11.000]  There should be no fear.
[54:11.000 --> 54:13.000]  We are protected.
[54:13.000 --> 54:16.000]  And we will always be protected.
[54:16.000 --> 54:22.000]  We will be protected by the great men and women of our military and law enforcement.
[54:22.000 --> 54:29.000]  And most importantly, we will be protected by God.
[54:29.000 --> 54:30.000]  Yes.
[54:30.000 --> 54:32.000]  Shields up.
[54:32.000 --> 54:33.000]  Boom.
[54:33.000 --> 54:35.000]  They're always like, get rid of God.
[54:35.000 --> 54:36.000]  Don't believe in God.
[54:36.000 --> 54:38.000]  But behind the scenes are bringing those babies.
[54:38.000 --> 54:42.000]  And they're all about their will to dominate people because they're so weak.
[54:42.000 --> 54:46.000]  If they had a big will, they would want to will people to be successful.
[54:46.000 --> 54:48.000]  Now, let me get to Glenn Beck.
[54:48.000 --> 54:50.000]  I said this during the campaign.
[54:50.000 --> 54:55.000]  I knew this from our sources, but I also knew it from announcements and laws.
[54:55.000 --> 54:57.000]  And Hillary saying, we're going to shut down the alt-right.
[54:57.000 --> 54:59.000]  Alex Jones, we're going to sue him.
[54:59.000 --> 55:07.000]  We're going to have a Justice Department lawsuit to shut him up on the WikiLeaks and on a bunch
[55:07.000 --> 55:08.000]  of other issues.
[55:08.000 --> 55:11.000]  I mean, I have this from high-level sources.
[55:11.000 --> 55:12.000]  But then Trump won.
[55:12.000 --> 55:17.000]  And so they're still going ahead with the censorship, the censorship on YouTube, Google, Facebook,
[55:17.000 --> 55:20.000]  Twitter, shutting everybody down, kicking them off, not letting them advertise, not letting
[55:20.000 --> 55:21.000]  them have advertisers.
[55:21.000 --> 55:26.000]  Millie did a video on her own channel as Millions of Views on the channel where she talked to
[55:26.000 --> 55:29.000]  our reporters where she said, oh, look, we're being censored.
[55:29.000 --> 55:33.000]  Alex Jones has kicked off Google's ad role that they control.
[55:33.000 --> 55:38.000]  And they blocked her channel and blocked that video and wouldn't let her monetize it.
[55:38.000 --> 55:39.000]  She's like, this is political.
[55:39.000 --> 55:40.000]  It's not acceptable.
[55:40.000 --> 55:48.000]  Oh, but everything else political that's anti-America, anti-Trump, it is acceptable.
[55:48.000 --> 55:51.000]  She did a video on it in full or censored.
[55:51.000 --> 55:54.000]  Millie Weaver on YouTube.
[55:54.000 --> 55:56.000]  So it's everywhere.
[55:56.000 --> 55:58.000]  They're trying to shut us down.
[55:58.000 --> 56:01.000]  They're trying to block us because they know we're winning.
[56:01.000 --> 56:04.000]  And he knew that was coming.
[56:04.000 --> 56:06.000]  Glenn Beck really believed they were going to win.
[56:06.000 --> 56:10.000]  He'd be the lone conservative left on air, basically, who would be a phony conservative and admit
[56:10.000 --> 56:14.000]  we're wrong and basically be loyal opposition, a Judas Iscariot.
[56:14.000 --> 56:20.000]  So now he's still stuck in that position on there doing the old plan, just like all the
[56:20.000 --> 56:23.000]  other old plans they had, as if Hillary got in or just moving forward.
[56:23.000 --> 56:27.000]  TV shows where it's a woman president and Alex Jones characters against him.
[56:27.000 --> 56:28.000]  All of it.
[56:28.000 --> 56:31.000]  That's why they're in such disarray because they believe they were invincible.
[56:31.000 --> 56:32.000]  You're not scumbags.
[56:32.000 --> 56:34.000]  Let's play the Club of Beck.
[56:34.000 --> 56:41.000]  What is frightening to me is the lack of reaction from the crowd at CPAC.
[56:41.000 --> 56:45.000]  He dropped economic nationalism two or three times.
[56:45.000 --> 56:47.000]  Oh my gosh.
[56:47.000 --> 56:49.000]  A country is nationalistic?
[56:49.000 --> 56:50.000]  Nationalism a lot.
[56:50.000 --> 56:56.000]  I don't know what Steve Bannon's plan is after he would burn down the system.
[56:56.000 --> 56:58.000]  Well, the globalists try to plunge the economy.
[56:58.000 --> 56:59.000]  Repeatedly.
[56:59.000 --> 57:00.000]  But Trump pops it back up.
[57:00.000 --> 57:02.000]  The system down to the ground.
[57:02.000 --> 57:03.000]  That's not good.
[57:03.000 --> 57:05.000]  No conservative would be for that.
[57:05.000 --> 57:09.000]  We are for conserving the Constitution of the United States of America.
[57:09.000 --> 57:14.000]  He has carried through on some of the promises that I didn't think he would.
[57:14.000 --> 57:16.000]  I'll stop right there.
[57:16.000 --> 57:21.000]  So nationalism is frightening, having fair trade deals is frightening.
[57:21.000 --> 57:23.000]  What are we going to do if they burn it down?
[57:23.000 --> 57:27.000]  They're threatening rigs at the EU as to plunge England if they don't submit an unelected group taking him over.
[57:27.000 --> 57:28.000]  Same thing in Italy.
[57:28.000 --> 57:29.000]  Same thing in Spain.
[57:29.000 --> 57:30.000]  Same thing in Brazil.
[57:30.000 --> 57:37.000]  They're telling us that we've just got to accept all this too and just be dictated to by some secret TPP.
[57:37.000 --> 57:39.000]  But that's okay because it's bad Trump pulled out.
[57:39.000 --> 57:40.000]  That's what's dangerous.
[57:40.000 --> 57:44.000]  He's our president, pulled us out of a secret agreement that turns over our sovereignty.
[57:44.000 --> 57:46.000]  We'll be back with the second hour. Stay with us.
[57:46.000 --> 58:15.000]  Stay with us. Read the word.
[58:16.000 --> 58:18.000]  We need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[58:18.000 --> 58:21.000]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[58:21.000 --> 58:26.000]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[58:26.000 --> 58:32.000]  From the outside structure full of minerals and Kiko factors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body.
[58:32.000 --> 58:34.000]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[58:34.000 --> 58:41.000]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were.
[58:41.000 --> 58:42.000]  And this is a big part of it.
[58:42.000 --> 58:47.000]  I know you're going to want to check out caveman ultimate paleo formula for yourself in ForWarsLives.com today.
[59:13.000 --> 59:16.000]  We need each day with our modern diets.

[1:00:11.000 --> 1:00:20.000]  The truth is, humanity is coming down fast, but we're miles above them on our journey to hell.
[1:00:20.000 --> 1:00:25.000]  I see you again to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:25.000 --> 1:00:28.000]  Alright, I want to talk to first-time callers tonight about what do you think of Trump?
[1:00:28.000 --> 1:00:32.000]  What do you think of the open witchcrafts on the news saying, you know, do black magic and try to kill Trump?
[1:00:32.000 --> 1:00:36.000]  Didn't work, dude, he's alive.
[1:00:36.000 --> 1:00:41.000]  Look at Haiti, poor people. Satanists can only bully Satanists.
[1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:45.000]  And most Satanists are trying to get out of the system.
[1:00:45.000 --> 1:00:49.000]  I want to take your phone calls for first-time callers. Please have a clear phone.
[1:00:49.000 --> 1:00:52.000]  I don't care where you're calling from, just let us know. We'll go to you.
[1:00:52.000 --> 1:00:57.000]  Love hearing from you. 877-789-Alex. 877-789-2539.
[1:00:57.000 --> 1:01:01.000]  And Daria and others just pointed out, I just did a whole hour radio.
[1:01:01.000 --> 1:01:07.000]  You know, the big secret in talk radio is you really don't fund your show with the network ads or the few ads you've got.
[1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:11.000]  People really don't listen to those. They listen to what you say live on air.
[1:01:11.000 --> 1:01:18.000]  Well, let me just take this time to thank everybody because Google's front company, in my view, that's what they are.
[1:01:18.000 --> 1:01:21.000]  It's the one company they let you do advertising with. Google used to do advertising.
[1:01:21.000 --> 1:01:25.000]  They got sued a lot, so they have this little subsidiary thing.
[1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:29.000]  It said, you know what? You've been with us almost three years. You can't advertise with Google anymore,
[1:01:29.000 --> 1:01:32.000]  even though we basically control the Internet and we're found about the U.S. government.
[1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:35.000]  We're going to come in and block you from access to the market.
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:41.000]  It's like saying black people can't, you know, stay in this hotel or go get food at this restaurant, you know, pre-1960s.
[1:01:41.000 --> 1:01:45.000]  It's the same deal. But it's okay because I'm a conservative or libertarian or Christian.
[1:01:45.000 --> 1:01:48.000]  I mean, I guess that's all right. No, it's not all right.
[1:01:48.000 --> 1:01:51.000]  But do I just move on with other technologies and move around that or do I sue them?
[1:01:51.000 --> 1:01:55.000]  Look, you know, the big question is, can we have a huge discount on products?
[1:01:55.000 --> 1:02:00.000]  We're in some cases, our normal markup is 100% on nutraceuticals. It's like 500 to 700% for other folks.
[1:02:00.000 --> 1:02:04.000]  And we lower stuff with discounts, so the markup is 50% or 20%.
[1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:10.000]  We brought in close to $2 million gross of the last week. Thank you.
[1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:14.000]  The money that came in to actually fund us is like $700,000. That sounds like a lot.
[1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:22.000]  You get 50, 60, 70 employees, contractors, servers, insurance, lawyers, the whole Kit Kat and Kaboodle, Lysington.
[1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:26.000]  That would run us for a couple months, maybe two months.
[1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:31.000]  So this is a big media operation. People want somebody to fight the new old orders.
[1:02:31.000 --> 1:02:35.000]  People want us to expose the pedophile rings, the globalist. People want somebody to get in the arena.
[1:02:35.000 --> 1:02:38.000]  We got to have the armor. We got to have the sword. We got to have the training.
[1:02:38.000 --> 1:02:41.000]  And I'm not bitching. I mean, you know, whatever.
[1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:48.000]  Sometimes I think if they completely shut us down and smash us, at least I can just kind of retire like Obi-Wan Kenobi to the desert somewhere.
[1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:53.000]  But I just really don't want that to happen. And we're having huge victories is why they're hitting us so hard.
[1:02:53.000 --> 1:02:57.000]  And there's been some other things going on that can be just as big and just as bad.
[1:02:57.000 --> 1:03:03.000]  I don't say that to bitch. I mean, we're over the target. That's why we're getting the flak.
[1:03:03.000 --> 1:03:08.000]  You know, when you're in a bomber, dropping truth bombs, there's guns down there trying to get you.
[1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:12.000]  So that's what we're doing. We're running really great specials.
[1:03:12.000 --> 1:03:19.000]  If you haven't had X to the good halogen, if you haven't taken the bone broth to marriage, a big caveman formula,
[1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:22.000]  if you haven't taken super male, super female, you don't know what you're doing.
[1:03:22.000 --> 1:03:26.000]  Take the new tropic, the brain booster, brain force.
[1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:31.000]  This is now the stuff goes back and forth in pole position. The best seller we've got.
[1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:38.000]  And it's got 2,649 reviews from third party sites. You can link through and look at it.
[1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:42.000]  No need to plug this. Just take it. You'll find out.
[1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:48.000]  You can get 10% off. You sign up for auto ship. Sign up every 15 days, 30 days, 60 days, 90 days.
[1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:54.000]  Whatever you want, infowarstore.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[1:03:54.000 --> 1:04:02.000]  And at the price it is 2246. That's a $17 savings.
[1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:08.000]  This is normally less expensive than some of the top new tropics out there that aren't even as good.
[1:04:08.000 --> 1:04:12.000]  This has got some things in it that are already prescription in Europe. It's amazing.
[1:04:12.000 --> 1:04:15.000]  It supports the broadcast, triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[1:04:15.000 --> 1:04:20.000]  But I want to thank all of you that have been supporting us. I want to set up a D.C. Bureau.
[1:04:20.000 --> 1:04:26.000]  I want to be able to have the funds to defend against attacks, it's lawsuits, it's things like that.
[1:04:26.000 --> 1:04:32.000]  Because I know we've been honorable, we've focused on the truth, we've been good. I'm not settling jack crap with anybody.
[1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:38.000]  Just know that. They told me a long, hard road either way and I love it.
[1:04:38.000 --> 1:04:42.000]  Because, well, you're walking on the fighting side of me.
[1:04:42.000 --> 1:04:46.000]  All right, we'll be back with your phone calls and more straight ahead.
[1:04:46.000 --> 1:04:50.000]  I'm Alex Jones. We've got a ton of clips and articles I haven't gotten to.
[1:04:50.000 --> 1:04:57.000]  Please stay with us and spread the URL infowars.com because they admit it. They're trying to shut it down.
[1:05:21.000 --> 1:05:27.000]  Caveman. It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[1:05:27.000 --> 1:05:29.000]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture them.
[1:05:29.000 --> 1:05:35.000]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal. You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking.
[1:05:35.000 --> 1:05:41.000]  But you used the bones for strength, from the outside structure full of minerals and Kiko factors,
[1:05:41.000 --> 1:05:46.000]  to the marrow that produces the blood for the body. This is the engine of the life essence.
[1:05:46.000 --> 1:05:51.000]  A long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence
[1:05:51.000 --> 1:05:54.000]  that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[1:05:54.000 --> 1:06:20.000]  We're going to want to check out Caveman, ultimate paleo formula for yourself and ForrestLive.com today.
[1:06:24.000 --> 1:06:40.000]  As I sit here, so honored, so humbled, so blessed to be with you on this Sunday, global transmission.
[1:06:40.000 --> 1:06:52.000]  Things are so incredible. Things are so fantastical, so dizzying, so filled with wonder that I have trouble even believing it.
[1:06:52.000 --> 1:07:00.000]  You have Trump invoking God and unity and birthright and destiny and advanced technology and life extension
[1:07:00.000 --> 1:07:04.000]  and all these secrets that have already been discovered in many cases.
[1:07:04.000 --> 1:07:10.000]  You look how far as humans have come since fire and the wheel and stone implements and right through to now,
[1:07:10.000 --> 1:07:23.000]  we have already jumped to 100,000 times the technological prowess of just 100 years ago.
[1:07:23.000 --> 1:07:35.000]  And now the acceleration is exponential and the so-called elites, the inbred generational families are just totally freaked out
[1:07:35.000 --> 1:07:43.000]  wanting to suppress all this and putting out promo videos for kids all over the world
[1:07:43.000 --> 1:07:48.000]  where it shows humans as a disease killing the earth and then spreading like a virus of space.
[1:07:48.000 --> 1:07:53.000]  I mean, if these aren't aliens manipulating our government trying to destroy us, they might as well be,
[1:07:53.000 --> 1:07:59.000]  and I'm not saying they literally are, it's just this is an anti-human kill, steal and destroy program
[1:07:59.000 --> 1:08:08.000]  and it's what the globalists are pushing, it's what the leftists are pushing, it's what Obama and Hitler are pushing,
[1:08:08.000 --> 1:08:15.000]  it's what all these central globalists are pushing.
[1:08:15.000 --> 1:08:21.000]  And it's an amazing time to be alive, I want to go to Carlos and Ryan and Dan and A-braces and Connie and others,
[1:08:21.000 --> 1:08:26.000]  we're opening the phones up for first time callers tonight to talk about what do you make of mainstream news saying,
[1:08:26.000 --> 1:08:32.000]  have witchcraft, you know, Friday and Saturday night against Trump, movie stars, Hollywood stars, let's hope he dies,
[1:08:32.000 --> 1:08:38.000]  and then town hall meetings saying hail Lucifer when Christians pray, you know, at the start of an event
[1:08:38.000 --> 1:08:44.000]  or people saying hail Satan of the Texas Capitol, the pro-life event, you're showing up, I mean, these people are out of control
[1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:48.000]  and then Trump's saying, I'm not going to the White House Correspondents' Dinner because the president makes the event,
[1:08:48.000 --> 1:08:53.000]  you say you hate me, you're the enemy press, you're collapsing, you have no viewers, if I show up, you'll have all the viewers,
[1:08:53.000 --> 1:08:58.000]  why should I give you the fire of the viewers, the Promethean fire?
[1:08:58.000 --> 1:09:05.000]  And by the way, there's over 100 MSM groups that are always at the front of the list, excluding in the room size,
[1:09:05.000 --> 1:09:12.000]  all these other radio stations, TV networks and other groups, a lot of them are even mainstream, not just, quote, alternative or patriot.
[1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:17.000]  We're going to just take four or five big MSM groups off the list today and you'll get back on next week,
[1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:21.000]  we're going to let these folks in, they can't ever get in, CNN says we always get in.
[1:09:21.000 --> 1:09:24.000]  We're entitled, we're CNN.
[1:09:24.000 --> 1:09:31.000]  Does it matter we have a shadow of ourselves and our top show has a million viewers and our lowest show is 50,000 at midnight or so?
[1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:33.000]  Does it matter?
[1:09:33.000 --> 1:09:42.000]  Because Glenn Beck's back on CNN saying, it's very frightening that Bannon spoke repeatedly about nationalism and better trade deals.
[1:09:42.000 --> 1:09:46.000]  Why, countries don't do that, that's not conservative.
[1:09:46.000 --> 1:09:51.000]  No reason to go shit and sit and pretend.
[1:09:51.000 --> 1:10:01.000]  Trump says the Washington Post and pretend that with the fake media, that's right, they're pretenders to the birthright of America.
[1:10:01.000 --> 1:10:07.000]  They're frauds, they pretend they're powerful, they pretend they're in charge and then we're sitting here just to believe the illusion.
[1:10:07.000 --> 1:10:15.000]  The illusion of MSM is falling, it's dying right now.
[1:10:15.000 --> 1:10:23.000]  I want to start taking your phone calls and we'll do that after the break, but I've got a bunch of clips I want to get to as well.
[1:10:23.000 --> 1:10:31.000]  You've got to play this again because Trump slams fake news at CPAC, but if you watch Colbert attacking me and Trump in the same piece three days ago,
[1:10:31.000 --> 1:10:38.000]  or you watch who was a fake guy doing a fake newscast, like he's a fake news presenter, saying we're fake,
[1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:42.000]  they said Trump wants to ban the media, Trump says the media's fake.
[1:10:42.000 --> 1:10:51.000]  No, he said you posing as a journalist is fake and seeing in lying is fake and then you go and say no, he said the media's fake
[1:10:51.000 --> 1:10:55.000]  and Trump comes out and exposes that and they still keep doing it.
[1:10:55.000 --> 1:11:01.000]  He says when seeing in lies and lies about our crowd size or lies about what I said, they're fake news.
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:05.000]  They come out and say, Trump says all media is the enemy.
[1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:13.000]  No, he said fake news is the enemy and they just can't help it because they have this culture as scumbags of praying on their viewers.
[1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:18.000]  So here it is, Trump slams fake news media. Here it is.
[1:11:18.000 --> 1:11:22.000]  I want you all to know that we are fighting the fake news. It's fake.
[1:11:22.000 --> 1:11:32.000]  A few days ago, I called the fake news the enemy of the people and they are. They are the enemy of the people because they have no sources.
[1:11:32.000 --> 1:11:37.000]  They just make them up when there are none, you know, the dishonest media.
[1:11:37.000 --> 1:11:41.000]  They'll say he didn't get a standing ovation. You know why?
[1:11:41.000 --> 1:11:45.000]  No, you know why? Because everybody stood and nobody sat.
[1:11:45.000 --> 1:11:48.000]  So they will say he never got a standing ovation.
[1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:50.000]  Right?
[1:11:50.000 --> 1:12:07.000]  They are the worst.
[1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:11.000]  Donald Trump did not get a standing ovation.
[1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:16.000]  They leave out the part. They never sat down. They leave that out.
[1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:28.000]  They are very dishonest people. In fact, in covering my comments, the dishonest media did not explain that I called the fake news the enemy of the people, the fakeness.
[1:12:28.000 --> 1:12:38.000]  They dropped off the word fake and all of a sudden the story became the media is the enemy.
[1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:47.000]  They take the word fake out and now I'm saying, oh, no, this is no good, but that's the way they are.
[1:12:47.000 --> 1:12:51.000]  So I'm not against the media. I'm not against the press.
[1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:59.000]  I don't mind bad stories if I deserve them and I love good stories, but we won't.
[1:12:59.000 --> 1:13:08.000]  I don't get too many. But I am only against the fake news media or press.
[1:13:08.000 --> 1:13:16.000]  Fake. Fake. They have to leave that word.
[1:13:16.000 --> 1:13:25.000]  By the way, I've watched probably a thousand of his speeches or more in the last two years and I was just coughing a little bit. I'm a regular guy.
[1:13:25.000 --> 1:13:31.000]  He doesn't ever cough. He doesn't ever stumble. It's like a machine.
[1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:39.000]  And what comes out of the end of the machine is prosperity and freedom and family and love of God and religious freedom.
[1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:44.000]  You can go worship the devil all day long. Just don't grab kids out backyards or anything.
[1:13:44.000 --> 1:13:49.000]  That's why they hate him because we've been hijacked by a bunch of scum.
[1:13:49.000 --> 1:14:00.000]  And we now realize that CNN, MSNBC, all of it, Fox, except for a few shows is attacking Trump, they all need him and they all need us.
[1:14:00.000 --> 1:14:02.000]  And they sit there and they play those games.
[1:14:02.000 --> 1:14:07.000]  Megan Kelly, I'm talking about Hillary funded ISIS in Al Qaeda to go hundreds of thousands of people in Syria,
[1:14:07.000 --> 1:14:10.000]  tens of thousands of children raped and killed as he's personally responsible.
[1:14:10.000 --> 1:14:19.000]  They cut that together and say that I say it's pizza place in D.C. when it's not.
[1:14:19.000 --> 1:14:25.000]  And the media tells me, give us a retraction that Hillary's personally murdering kids in the bottom of some pizza place.
[1:14:25.000 --> 1:14:27.000]  And I say, I never said that.
[1:14:27.000 --> 1:14:32.000]  Megan Kelly played that clip out of context, lying to people.
[1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:39.000]  I covered the news articles about what was being claimed at the pizza place.
[1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:44.000]  But see, I'm the big target, just like Trump is, because I'm actually talking.
[1:14:44.000 --> 1:14:47.000]  People keep saying, why does Alex make the same hand gestures as Trump?
[1:14:47.000 --> 1:14:48.000]  You go back 20 years.
[1:14:48.000 --> 1:14:49.000]  This is the hand gesture I make.
[1:14:49.000 --> 1:14:51.000]  Nobody makes that with me and Trump.
[1:14:51.000 --> 1:14:52.000]  I don't know what's going on.
[1:14:52.000 --> 1:14:53.000]  I'm starting to get freaked out.
[1:14:53.000 --> 1:14:54.000]  I mean, I'll be able to do this.
[1:14:54.000 --> 1:14:56.000]  It just means you can bet it's done.
[1:14:56.000 --> 1:14:57.000]  I was a little kid.
[1:14:57.000 --> 1:14:58.000]  They like Jell-O ads.
[1:14:58.000 --> 1:14:59.000]  They went, eh, it's good.
[1:14:59.000 --> 1:15:02.000]  That means, hey, it's like Italian restaurant.
[1:15:02.000 --> 1:15:03.000]  A hundred years ago.
[1:15:03.000 --> 1:15:05.000]  It's delicious.
[1:15:05.000 --> 1:15:07.000]  It means good.
[1:15:07.000 --> 1:15:10.000]  It's not some Illuminati symbol.
[1:15:10.000 --> 1:15:14.000]  But this, see anybody that me and Trump do that, I don't know.
[1:15:14.000 --> 1:15:16.000]  Why have I been doing that for 21 years?
[1:15:16.000 --> 1:15:19.000]  It just seems like, I just do it.
[1:15:19.000 --> 1:15:23.000]  I'm starting to realize, everybody's kind of starting to notice these similarities.
[1:15:23.000 --> 1:15:27.000]  Kind of ignored it.
[1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:31.000]  But then I started to really pay attention to a bunch of stuff.
[1:15:31.000 --> 1:15:32.000]  And it's weird.
[1:15:32.000 --> 1:15:33.000]  It's weird.
[1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:35.000]  The liberals are the ones that actually noticed it.
[1:15:35.000 --> 1:15:36.000]  It's crazy.
[1:15:36.000 --> 1:15:38.000]  It's New York patriot, Info Warrior.
[1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:41.000]  He's been awake to this for, since he was 30 years old.
[1:15:41.000 --> 1:15:42.000]  You got me down here.
[1:15:42.000 --> 1:15:43.000]  I've been awake about 25 years.
[1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:44.000]  It's just crazy.
[1:15:44.000 --> 1:15:45.000]  Enough about that.
[1:15:45.000 --> 1:15:46.000]  I'm going to come back and take your phone calls.
[1:15:46.000 --> 1:15:47.000]  Got a bunch of other clips we're going to get to.
[1:15:47.000 --> 1:15:49.000]  But remember, they're trying to censor us.
[1:15:49.000 --> 1:15:50.000]  They're trying to shut us down.
[1:15:50.000 --> 1:15:51.000]  Support our local affiliates.

[1:16:58.000 --> 1:17:03.000]  National Defense Labs and Citizen Armor has given InfoWars
[1:17:03.000 --> 1:17:07.000]  the exclusive on distributing to the American people
[1:17:07.000 --> 1:17:09.000]  the true next generation in body armor.
[1:17:09.000 --> 1:17:12.000]  Basically what we're bringing to the InfoWars team
[1:17:12.000 --> 1:17:17.000]  is a new line of dynamic, lightweight body armor.
[1:17:17.000 --> 1:17:20.000]  It is lighter, more flexible, easier to wear,
[1:17:20.000 --> 1:17:23.000]  more comfortable and stronger than anything else on the market.
[1:17:23.000 --> 1:17:25.000]  So when you talk to people that have been using this
[1:17:25.000 --> 1:17:26.000]  actually testing it for years,
[1:17:26.000 --> 1:17:28.000]  people that currently are testing it for us,
[1:17:28.000 --> 1:17:29.000]  they didn't just say outstanding.
[1:17:29.000 --> 1:17:30.000]  What they really say about them.
[1:17:30.000 --> 1:17:32.000]  They want to know, how do they get it?
[1:17:32.000 --> 1:17:33.000]  Where do they find it?
[1:17:33.000 --> 1:17:35.000]  A lot of my law enforcement official buddies
[1:17:35.000 --> 1:17:36.000]  want to know the same thing.
[1:17:36.000 --> 1:17:40.000]  The backpack body armor is only $200.
[1:17:40.000 --> 1:17:41.000]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[1:17:41.000 --> 1:17:42.000]  It's a quarter inch thick.
[1:17:42.000 --> 1:17:43.000]  It's got a 20-year warranty.
[1:17:43.000 --> 1:17:44.000]  It's waterproof.
[1:17:44.000 --> 1:17:45.000]  You can wear it.
[1:17:45.000 --> 1:17:46.000]  It's comfortable.
[1:17:46.000 --> 1:17:47.000]  And we shot everything you can imagine of it.

[1:18:53.000 --> 1:18:55.000]  and the products at infowarsteam.com

[1:19:26.000 --> 1:19:27.000]  Hi.
[1:19:27.000 --> 1:19:28.000]  God was in school.
[1:19:28.000 --> 1:19:30.000]  Morality had a future.
[1:19:30.000 --> 1:19:33.000]  And beef was for supper.
[1:19:33.000 --> 1:19:34.000]  Revelation.
[1:19:34.000 --> 1:19:36.000]  Dawn of global government.
[1:19:36.000 --> 1:19:37.000]  We're the solution.
[1:19:37.000 --> 1:19:38.000]  Americans.
[1:19:38.000 --> 1:19:40.000]  Ain't nothing more to it than that.
[1:19:40.000 --> 1:19:42.000]  Starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels,
[1:19:42.000 --> 1:19:45.000]  and Special Ops General Jerry Boykin,
[1:19:45.000 --> 1:19:47.000]  theatrical screenings on demand.
[1:19:47.000 --> 1:19:48.000]  DVDs now available.
[1:19:48.000 --> 1:19:50.000]  Wanna shed some tears
[1:19:50.000 --> 1:19:52.000]  over the red, white and blue?
[1:19:52.000 --> 1:19:54.000]  Americans need to see this film.
[1:19:54.000 --> 1:19:55.000]  Revelation.
[1:19:55.000 --> 1:19:57.000]  The movie.info.
[1:19:57.000 --> 1:19:58.000]  Let's fix it.
[1:20:02.000 --> 1:20:05.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:11.000 --> 1:20:13.000]  We are on the march.
[1:20:13.000 --> 1:20:16.000]  The empire is on the run.
[1:20:16.000 --> 1:20:20.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[1:20:20.000 --> 1:20:25.000]  I'm waiting in my car.
[1:20:25.000 --> 1:20:26.000]  All right.
[1:20:26.000 --> 1:20:29.000]  I notice a theme emerging on the calls.
[1:20:29.000 --> 1:20:31.000]  We've got like 12 callers on the board.
[1:20:31.000 --> 1:20:33.000]  That's the limit of the calls we can see.
[1:20:33.000 --> 1:20:37.000]  One time we had 24,000 calls in just three hours.
[1:20:37.000 --> 1:20:39.000]  Other talk show hosts
[1:20:39.000 --> 1:20:42.000]  beg for phone calls with 20 plus thousand calls.
[1:20:42.000 --> 1:20:43.000]  I'm not bragging.
[1:20:43.000 --> 1:20:44.000]  It just shows you.
[1:20:44.000 --> 1:20:45.000]  Again, they're all about how they're the MSN.
[1:20:45.000 --> 1:20:46.000]  They have the audience.
[1:20:46.000 --> 1:20:48.000]  Seeing in hardly ever takes calls.
[1:20:48.000 --> 1:20:51.000]  All they do, they have to beg for them.
[1:20:51.000 --> 1:20:53.000]  Because at five o'clock,
[1:20:53.000 --> 1:20:57.000]  they take our republic to the gallows pole.
[1:21:00.000 --> 1:21:01.000]  They want to kill this republic.
[1:21:01.000 --> 1:21:05.000]  It won't go so easily, quietly, into the night.
[1:21:05.000 --> 1:21:08.000]  If they want to fight,
[1:21:08.000 --> 1:21:10.000]  they're going to get one.
[1:21:10.000 --> 1:21:11.000]  I never want to fight.
[1:21:11.000 --> 1:21:12.000]  I started.
[1:21:12.000 --> 1:21:13.000]  I only started a couple.
[1:21:13.000 --> 1:21:16.000]  I won every fight somebody else started.
[1:21:16.000 --> 1:21:19.000]  Every time.
[1:21:19.000 --> 1:21:21.000]  And that's what it comes down to, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:21:21.000 --> 1:21:22.000]  They have initiated the fight.
[1:21:22.000 --> 1:21:27.000]  They're going to lose.
[1:21:27.000 --> 1:21:28.000]  All right.
[1:21:28.000 --> 1:21:33.000]  I want to go to your phone calls briefly.
[1:21:33.000 --> 1:21:34.000]  It's admitted.
[1:21:34.000 --> 1:21:36.000]  And we've all gotten so calm about it
[1:21:36.000 --> 1:21:41.000]  that Facebook's blocking mild promotion
[1:21:41.000 --> 1:21:43.000]  of let's make America great again.
[1:21:43.000 --> 1:21:44.000]  Hey, it's great.
[1:21:44.000 --> 1:21:45.000]  You're jobless.
[1:21:45.000 --> 1:21:47.000]  Numbers have gone down.
[1:21:47.000 --> 1:21:49.000]  And then you own a major sporting goods store.
[1:21:49.000 --> 1:21:52.000]  I know somebody that works and runs their marketing.
[1:21:52.000 --> 1:21:55.000]  And they get suspended for a day on Facebook.
[1:21:55.000 --> 1:21:57.000]  And their boss comes and says, why does that happen?
[1:21:57.000 --> 1:22:01.000]  Well, we got suspended for political speech, they say.
[1:22:01.000 --> 1:22:03.000]  And then, of course, the upper level management says,
[1:22:03.000 --> 1:22:04.000]  well, then don't do it again.
[1:22:04.000 --> 1:22:07.000]  Well, now, even your sporting goods store doesn't,
[1:22:07.000 --> 1:22:09.000]  you know, have optimism for America.
[1:22:09.000 --> 1:22:11.000]  This is how this is working.
[1:22:11.000 --> 1:22:13.000]  And then most of these people are scared to speak out.
[1:22:13.000 --> 1:22:16.000]  I know for a fact that other big libertarian patriot sites
[1:22:16.000 --> 1:22:18.000]  are getting kicked off head roll.
[1:22:18.000 --> 1:22:19.000]  They're getting censored.
[1:22:19.000 --> 1:22:20.000]  They're scared to speak out.
[1:22:20.000 --> 1:22:23.000]  They're hoping they can grovel back to it.
[1:22:23.000 --> 1:22:28.000]  It's this instinct to be raped.
[1:22:28.000 --> 1:22:31.000]  And so YouTube and Google and, of course,
[1:22:31.000 --> 1:22:34.000]  as part of Google is YouTube, they're all censoring right now.
[1:22:34.000 --> 1:22:36.000]  And the answer is, don't give in to it.
[1:22:36.000 --> 1:22:40.000]  Speak out against it and say it's wrong.
[1:22:40.000 --> 1:22:43.000]  Well, at all the anti-American globalist crap be online,
[1:22:43.000 --> 1:22:45.000]  but you start talking about stuff.
[1:22:45.000 --> 1:22:46.000]  They'll delete your video.
[1:22:46.000 --> 1:22:48.000]  They'll demonetize it.
[1:22:48.000 --> 1:22:49.000]  They'll suspend you.
[1:22:49.000 --> 1:22:50.000]  You name it.
[1:22:50.000 --> 1:22:52.000]  The answer is, make an issue out of it.
[1:22:52.000 --> 1:22:53.000]  Speak out of it.
[1:22:53.000 --> 1:22:54.000]  Talk about it.
[1:22:54.000 --> 1:22:55.000]  Or then it becomes normalized.
[1:22:55.000 --> 1:22:58.000]  Then they start ratcheting it up.
[1:22:58.000 --> 1:23:00.000]  We got a bunch of collars want to talk about
[1:23:00.000 --> 1:23:01.000]  what they're seeing happen.
[1:23:01.000 --> 1:23:02.000]  I mean, I remember seeing this years ago,
[1:23:02.000 --> 1:23:06.000]  where you'd have Navy Seal grip about Benghazi.
[1:23:06.000 --> 1:23:10.000]  Put together a meme about Hillary lied, they died,
[1:23:10.000 --> 1:23:12.000]  just images of the men's faces.
[1:23:12.000 --> 1:23:15.000]  Facebook would block that because it was viral.
[1:23:15.000 --> 1:23:18.000]  Now they're just blocking stuff and not letting you spread things.
[1:23:18.000 --> 1:23:21.000]  Or on Trump's Twitter, it's only negative comments
[1:23:21.000 --> 1:23:22.000]  that go to the top.
[1:23:22.000 --> 1:23:23.000]  They're controlling that and admitting they are.
[1:23:23.000 --> 1:23:26.000]  They said, hell, we might just ban him,
[1:23:26.000 --> 1:23:28.000]  the president, off Twitter.
[1:23:28.000 --> 1:23:30.000]  So if you support the president,
[1:23:30.000 --> 1:23:32.000]  they're trying to block you off these third-party sites.
[1:23:32.000 --> 1:23:35.000]  So raid these third-party sites with the truth.
[1:23:35.000 --> 1:23:37.000]  Get the info out there even harder.
[1:23:37.000 --> 1:23:39.000]  But build your own site again.
[1:23:39.000 --> 1:23:41.000]  Go back to those like Matt Drudge warned here
[1:23:41.000 --> 1:23:43.000]  in his only interview in four years,
[1:23:43.000 --> 1:23:45.000]  a year and a half ago or a year and three months ago.
[1:23:45.000 --> 1:23:47.000]  Create your own system.
[1:23:47.000 --> 1:23:49.000]  Build your, we have our own streams,
[1:23:49.000 --> 1:23:51.000]  our own podcast, our own audio,
[1:23:51.000 --> 1:23:53.000]  our own, you name it, infowars.com.
[1:23:53.000 --> 1:23:58.000]  We can still contact you via email

[1:24:01.000 --> 1:24:04.000]  for the shopping cart you name it, infowarsstore.com.

[1:24:11.000 --> 1:24:13.000]  We have the last chance for the defense of liberty
[1:24:13.000 --> 1:24:14.000]  and free speech.
[1:24:14.000 --> 1:24:15.000]  Make America great again.
[1:24:15.000 --> 1:24:18.000]  Mega specials that end tomorrow.

[1:24:31.000 --> 1:24:34.000]  and in a store they'd be hundreds or not thousands framed.
[1:24:34.000 --> 1:24:36.000]  Free Alexa pure water filter with three months supply
[1:24:36.000 --> 1:24:38.000]  of high quality, my patriot, infowars,

[1:24:42.000 --> 1:24:44.000]  in the fight against the globalist.
[1:24:44.000 --> 1:24:46.000]  Help defend infowars and help us bring in more capital
[1:24:46.000 --> 1:24:48.000]  to fund this news operation under the censorship
[1:24:48.000 --> 1:24:50.000]  with these make America great again.
[1:24:50.000 --> 1:24:52.000]  Specials, infowarsstore.com
[1:24:52.000 --> 1:24:56.000]  before we pull down these specials.
[1:24:56.000 --> 1:25:00.000]  We've got a limited edition Donald Trump M4 lower.
[1:25:00.000 --> 1:25:02.000]  That's 80% complete.
[1:25:02.000 --> 1:25:03.000]  That's about to sell out.
[1:25:03.000 --> 1:25:06.000]  That's got a laser scan, a laser burn of Trump.
[1:25:06.000 --> 1:25:09.000]  It says 1776 reborn.
[1:25:09.000 --> 1:25:13.000]  President of the United States, $45 J. Trump.
[1:25:13.000 --> 1:25:14.000]  And it's numbered.
[1:25:14.000 --> 1:25:16.000]  All right.
[1:25:16.000 --> 1:25:19.000]  Let me go ahead and start with your phone calls now.
[1:25:19.000 --> 1:25:21.000]  I've got other news and other clips.
[1:25:21.000 --> 1:25:22.000]  I'm going to hit as well.
[1:25:22.000 --> 1:25:24.000]  Some interesting scientific developments.
[1:25:24.000 --> 1:25:26.000]  But here's what I'm saying.
[1:25:26.000 --> 1:25:27.000]  People want us to fight.
[1:25:27.000 --> 1:25:28.000]  They want us to take action.
[1:25:28.000 --> 1:25:31.000]  They want to see people defeat the new world order,
[1:25:31.000 --> 1:25:33.000]  create a liberty narrative that counters them.
[1:25:33.000 --> 1:25:35.000]  You want to see us not just have a beachhead in Washington,
[1:25:35.000 --> 1:25:37.000]  but reverse it all.
[1:25:37.000 --> 1:25:41.000]  Trump knows he will win by delivering prosperity
[1:25:41.000 --> 1:25:42.000]  and restoring the republic.
[1:25:42.000 --> 1:25:43.000]  He's all in.
[1:25:43.000 --> 1:25:44.000]  There's no way he's fake.
[1:25:44.000 --> 1:25:46.000]  Attacking those that are anti free speech,
[1:25:46.000 --> 1:25:48.000]  attacking political correctness,
[1:25:48.000 --> 1:25:50.000]  promoting Americana, exposing globalism,
[1:25:50.000 --> 1:25:54.000]  exposing one time and one sided trade deals
[1:25:54.000 --> 1:25:56.000]  is coffin nails to their agenda.
[1:25:56.000 --> 1:25:57.000]  That's why they hate him.
[1:25:57.000 --> 1:26:01.000]  It's like Goldman Sachs gave 100% of their money to Hillary,
[1:26:01.000 --> 1:26:02.000]  not to Trump.
[1:26:02.000 --> 1:26:04.000]  Is he trying to recruit people from Goldman Sachs
[1:26:04.000 --> 1:26:05.000]  to join him in this quest?
[1:26:05.000 --> 1:26:06.000]  Absolutely.
[1:26:06.000 --> 1:26:10.000]  It's like trying to get the German general staff
[1:26:10.000 --> 1:26:13.000]  in World War II to be secret agents for America.
[1:26:13.000 --> 1:26:14.000]  Of course.
[1:26:14.000 --> 1:26:17.000]  But the globalist hate Trump, the great indicator.
[1:26:17.000 --> 1:26:20.000]  Then you look at what he's doing, the small business numbers.
[1:26:20.000 --> 1:26:22.000]  It's all coming in the best since 1984.
[1:26:22.000 --> 1:26:24.000]  And they howl and say shut it down.
[1:26:24.000 --> 1:26:28.000]  And if you try to promote the fact that even Bloomberg
[1:26:28.000 --> 1:26:31.000]  and CNN admit that Trump's doing great with small businesses
[1:26:31.000 --> 1:26:35.000]  in the general public, they try to shut it down.
[1:26:35.000 --> 1:26:36.000]  All right.
[1:26:36.000 --> 1:26:37.000]  Who do we go to first here?
[1:26:37.000 --> 1:26:40.000]  So many calls.
[1:26:40.000 --> 1:26:42.000]  We got Shane in Ohio.
[1:26:42.000 --> 1:26:43.000]  I want to talk about Facebook censorship.
[1:26:43.000 --> 1:26:45.000]  A lot of this is coming in.
[1:26:45.000 --> 1:26:47.000]  So let's talk about this because they don't want to announce this.
[1:26:47.000 --> 1:26:52.000]  Notice I announced on Monday that one of the biggest advertising hubs
[1:26:52.000 --> 1:26:56.000]  that Google makes you use to be on Google advertising.
[1:26:56.000 --> 1:26:57.000]  This isn't me selling you stuff.
[1:26:57.000 --> 1:26:59.000]  This is me trying to go out and sell stuff to make money
[1:26:59.000 --> 1:27:01.000]  to bring it back to fund the operation.
[1:27:01.000 --> 1:27:04.000]  Big part of why we even have money this year to operate.
[1:27:04.000 --> 1:27:06.000]  Now this is a huge blow.
[1:27:06.000 --> 1:27:09.000]  If we don't fix it and have surgery, we'll bleed out.
[1:27:09.000 --> 1:27:11.000]  This will really show that we're weak.
[1:27:11.000 --> 1:27:12.000]  They'll attack us more.
[1:27:12.000 --> 1:27:13.000]  We'll go down.
[1:27:13.000 --> 1:27:15.000]  We must beat this and get bigger.
[1:27:15.000 --> 1:27:17.000]  Not because I want to be bigger, believe me,
[1:27:17.000 --> 1:27:19.000]  but because that's how it works.
[1:27:19.000 --> 1:27:21.000]  You don't stay in stasis.
[1:27:21.000 --> 1:27:23.000]  You get smaller or bigger.
[1:27:23.000 --> 1:27:26.000]  And I have responsibility because if we get small,
[1:27:26.000 --> 1:27:28.000]  then they're really going to come in.
[1:27:28.000 --> 1:27:31.000]  We've got a hyper expand here.
[1:27:31.000 --> 1:27:32.000]  I realize that.
[1:27:32.000 --> 1:27:33.000]  I know it historically.
[1:27:33.000 --> 1:27:34.000]  I'm doing it.
[1:27:34.000 --> 1:27:37.000]  So again, I'm going to come back and take your calls, actually.
[1:27:37.000 --> 1:27:38.000]  We'll do two segments with them.
[1:27:38.000 --> 1:27:40.000]  But no, I'm going to go to one right now.
[1:27:40.000 --> 1:27:42.000]  Do I have a minute and a half?
[1:27:42.000 --> 1:27:43.000]  I've only got a minute and 20.
[1:27:43.000 --> 1:27:46.000]  I'm going to come back to Shane and others that are being censored.
[1:27:46.000 --> 1:27:47.000]  But it's everywhere.
[1:27:47.000 --> 1:27:49.000]  Everybody's talking about it.
[1:27:49.000 --> 1:27:52.000]  You can't even email an American flag on the Fourth of July,
[1:27:52.000 --> 1:27:55.000]  and they'll block you just like the Ninth Circuit ruled two years ago
[1:27:55.000 --> 1:27:57.000]  that American flags are banned in public schools in California
[1:27:57.000 --> 1:27:59.000]  because they're hurtful.
[1:27:59.000 --> 1:28:02.000]  Whiteboards all over colleges nationwide because someone might
[1:28:02.000 --> 1:28:04.000]  write something offensive or being banned.
[1:28:04.000 --> 1:28:05.000]  Detroit News, AP.
[1:28:05.000 --> 1:28:08.000]  And they're saying this is good.
[1:28:08.000 --> 1:28:10.000]  Again, that's like saying you can never write a book
[1:28:10.000 --> 1:28:12.000]  because you might write something hateful.
[1:28:12.000 --> 1:28:13.000]  You can't have whiteboards.
[1:28:13.000 --> 1:28:15.000]  This is real authoritarianism.
[1:28:15.000 --> 1:28:17.000]  It's not coming down the road.
[1:28:17.000 --> 1:28:18.000]  It was so bad.
[1:28:18.000 --> 1:28:20.000]  When they were going to get this in,
[1:28:20.000 --> 1:28:22.000]  they were going to physically come after us,
[1:28:22.000 --> 1:28:23.000]  and that was so crazy.
[1:28:23.000 --> 1:28:25.000]  I'll give you a big secret.
[1:28:25.000 --> 1:28:29.000]  A lot of the mercenaries inside the CIA and FBI and NSA
[1:28:29.000 --> 1:28:32.000]  and Defense Intelligence didn't block Hillary
[1:28:32.000 --> 1:28:34.000]  because they even cared about America
[1:28:34.000 --> 1:28:36.000]  and because they cared about God.
[1:28:36.000 --> 1:28:39.000]  They did it because they knew it would absolutely cause a civil war
[1:28:39.000 --> 1:28:42.000]  and was bad for business and their own selfish lives.
[1:28:42.000 --> 1:28:44.000]  But at least they weren't pure evil.
[1:28:44.000 --> 1:28:47.000]  Showcommitted like kamikazes, they were willing to bring it all down
[1:28:47.000 --> 1:28:48.000]  just to take over.
[1:28:48.000 --> 1:28:51.000]  But that's the big secret is the globalists were planning
[1:28:51.000 --> 1:28:54.000]  to bring it all down this year if Hillary got in
[1:28:54.000 --> 1:29:20.000]  the way.
[1:29:20.000 --> 1:29:24.000]  In the history of M4's life, we've brought out a lot of amazing products
[1:29:24.000 --> 1:29:28.000]  like Survival Shield X2, SuperMell Vitality and so many others
[1:29:28.000 --> 1:29:32.000]  with its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process
[1:29:32.000 --> 1:29:34.000]  designed for maximized effects.
[1:29:34.000 --> 1:29:38.000]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products
[1:29:38.000 --> 1:29:40.000]  and this part is most important.
[1:29:40.000 --> 1:29:44.000]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant derived
[1:29:44.000 --> 1:29:47.000]  or of the highest quality lab standard.

[1:30:58.000 --> 1:31:00.000]  This is Alex Jones.
[1:31:00.000 --> 1:31:03.000]  I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money
[1:31:03.000 --> 1:31:06.000]  on one of the best new off-the-grid products of 2017.
[1:31:06.000 --> 1:31:09.000]  And seriously, I really think everyone should have one of these.
[1:31:09.000 --> 1:31:11.000]  I'm talking about the PPX Solar Generator System
[1:31:11.000 --> 1:31:13.000]  from our friends at Solutions from Science,
[1:31:13.000 --> 1:31:15.000]  one of our oldest sponsors.
[1:31:15.000 --> 1:31:17.000]  The PPX is so small you can put it in your pocket,
[1:31:17.000 --> 1:31:21.000]  but so powerful you can run some 110 appliances at your house.
[1:31:21.000 --> 1:31:24.000]  Like a small refrigerator so you can keep food from spoiling.
[1:31:24.000 --> 1:31:27.000]  Plus, you can take it with you to jumpstart cars, trucks, buses,
[1:31:27.000 --> 1:31:30.000]  18-wheelers, heavy equipment, even airplanes.
[1:31:30.000 --> 1:31:33.000]  The system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity,
[1:31:33.000 --> 1:31:35.000]  allowing you to create your own private power grid,
[1:31:35.000 --> 1:31:37.000]  literally anywhere in the world.

[1:31:39.000 --> 1:31:42.000]  any time you need to get off the grid for a while.

[1:32:57.000 --> 1:33:24.000]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[1:33:24.000 --> 1:33:27.000]  This is the best style censorship.
[1:33:27.000 --> 1:33:30.000]  Chinese comments.
[1:33:30.000 --> 1:33:33.000]  Wow. Who would have thought it?
[1:33:36.000 --> 1:33:39.000]  Waging war on corruption.
[1:33:39.000 --> 1:33:44.000]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the infowar.
[1:33:44.000 --> 1:33:48.000]  You know, we'll do some report that I won't even think will be big
[1:33:48.000 --> 1:33:51.000]  and we'll get 25 million views, 30 million views, some of them.
[1:33:51.000 --> 1:33:55.000]  A lot of videos every week get over a million views, 2 million views, 4 million views.
[1:33:55.000 --> 1:34:00.000]  Just on Facebook and Google, YouTube, other areas.
[1:34:00.000 --> 1:34:03.000]  But then when the Communist Chinese are in the New York Times,
[1:34:03.000 --> 1:34:07.000]  the Wall Street Journal, PC World, you name it, this year,
[1:34:07.000 --> 1:34:10.000]  saying we're going to help the U.S. government
[1:34:10.000 --> 1:34:12.000]  censor the Liberty Movement and block Trump.
[1:34:12.000 --> 1:34:15.000]  Like the U.S. government now, Trump isn't in charge of it.
[1:34:15.000 --> 1:34:18.000]  And they just ignore him and move forward.
[1:34:18.000 --> 1:34:22.000]  So thank God he's not going to a correspondence dinner or kicking out the CNN
[1:34:22.000 --> 1:34:25.000]  that has been caught getting money from all the Arab states
[1:34:25.000 --> 1:34:27.000]  and the Communist Chinese.
[1:34:27.000 --> 1:34:32.000]  And there's news today where Hollywood is openly being bought up by the Chinese.
[1:34:32.000 --> 1:34:35.000]  I told people that 10 years ago and you said,
[1:34:35.000 --> 1:34:40.000]  oh, the Chinese own it and all the anti-Semites are like covering up for the Jews.
[1:34:40.000 --> 1:34:43.000]  Well, let's just say the Jewish people, a lot of them that own Hollywood,
[1:34:43.000 --> 1:34:46.000]  a lot of other folks as well, a lot of Italians in Hollywood owning it.
[1:34:46.000 --> 1:34:49.000]  A lot of other folks as well, you know, from James Cameron, you name it,
[1:34:49.000 --> 1:34:51.000]  they're selling out of the Chinese.
[1:34:51.000 --> 1:34:55.000]  And I told you that, just Google, Alex Jones, China buying up Hollywood,
[1:34:55.000 --> 1:34:57.000]  10 years ago.
[1:34:57.000 --> 1:35:00.000]  But see, that's what I'm about, is trailblazing.
[1:35:00.000 --> 1:35:03.000]  That's an authoritarian state that's enslaved its people,
[1:35:03.000 --> 1:35:05.000]  selling out and it's in the news.
[1:35:05.000 --> 1:35:08.000]  Oh man, is China validated about crackdown on fake news?
[1:35:08.000 --> 1:35:12.000]  Thank God, help us crack down on these Americans.
[1:35:12.000 --> 1:35:18.000]  Everyone should just instantly be done with PC World or anybody else that is like writing articles going,
[1:35:18.000 --> 1:35:22.000]  man, this Hitler in 1943, he really knows how to deal with people that cause problems.
[1:35:22.000 --> 1:35:24.000]  We ought to hit him with what he wants.
[1:35:24.000 --> 1:35:27.000]  But they think you're so stupid, they just act like that.
[1:35:27.000 --> 1:35:32.000]  But there's a large portion of folks that aren't that dumb.
[1:35:32.000 --> 1:35:35.000]  All right, I want to go to your phone calls talking about censorship and more.
[1:35:35.000 --> 1:35:38.000]  I'm going to try to move quick here so you make your point with the next person.
[1:35:38.000 --> 1:35:42.000]  Shane in Ohio, you're calling in about Facebook.
[1:35:42.000 --> 1:35:45.000]  And again, we just got censored off Google ads, but just, you know,
[1:35:45.000 --> 1:35:48.000]  you think everything I talk about is in the news, but not that.
[1:35:48.000 --> 1:35:52.000]  They want to have a stealth program of censorship until I file a lawsuit.
[1:35:52.000 --> 1:35:54.000]  Go ahead.
[1:35:54.000 --> 1:35:59.000]  Yeah, they've taken me and 13 that I know of, but my friends, and they're banning us.
[1:35:59.000 --> 1:36:02.000]  I'm banned right now for 30 days.
[1:36:02.000 --> 1:36:07.000]  That's no liking, no videos, no sharing, no videos, no messaging, nobody.
[1:36:07.000 --> 1:36:10.000]  They just use your data and your name whenever you ever said to them.
[1:36:10.000 --> 1:36:11.000]  They say they own it.
[1:36:11.000 --> 1:36:14.000]  So send us the post the message posted on YouTube.
[1:36:14.000 --> 1:36:17.000]  Use another platform to expose what they did.
[1:36:17.000 --> 1:36:21.000]  That's how we kind of jump across the lava here on the rocks or like across the stream.
[1:36:21.000 --> 1:36:24.000]  You have to then expose it in another venue.
[1:36:24.000 --> 1:36:26.000]  They think you're dumb and will only sit there and wait.
[1:36:26.000 --> 1:36:27.000]  Then you do it again.
[1:36:27.000 --> 1:36:28.000]  They ban you.
[1:36:28.000 --> 1:36:30.000]  So they're trying to teach you to be a good slave.
[1:36:30.000 --> 1:36:31.000]  Tell us what happened.
[1:36:31.000 --> 1:36:32.000]  You're right.
[1:36:32.000 --> 1:36:36.000]  So my, I got banned a while ago during the election.
[1:36:36.000 --> 1:36:39.000]  This is like the fourth ban and now it's a 30 day ban.
[1:36:39.000 --> 1:36:41.000]  It goes from like three days to seven days.
[1:36:41.000 --> 1:36:43.000]  The red, you know what I mean?
[1:36:43.000 --> 1:36:45.000]  And now it's a 30 day ban.
[1:36:45.000 --> 1:36:48.000]  And again, did you screenshot what the great evil was?
[1:36:48.000 --> 1:36:50.000]  Is that that you engaged in?
[1:36:50.000 --> 1:36:55.000]  My first great evil was I said that CNN equals Sandy Hook.
[1:36:55.000 --> 1:36:56.000]  That was it.
[1:36:56.000 --> 1:36:57.000]  Fake news.
[1:36:57.000 --> 1:36:58.000]  It's fake.
[1:36:58.000 --> 1:36:59.000]  And that was it.
[1:36:59.000 --> 1:37:00.000]  That was it.
[1:37:00.000 --> 1:37:03.000]  I don't want you to question their, you know, their narratives.
[1:37:03.000 --> 1:37:06.000]  They would ever stage something even though they've been caught doing it.
[1:37:06.000 --> 1:37:08.000]  I think a lot of CNN did happen, but you know,
[1:37:08.000 --> 1:37:10.000]  we have a right to question as Americans regardless.
[1:37:10.000 --> 1:37:11.000]  All right.
[1:37:11.000 --> 1:37:14.000]  Well, I hear you and expose it when something happens.
[1:37:14.000 --> 1:37:15.000]  Talk about it.
[1:37:15.000 --> 1:37:16.000]  What you've just done.
[1:37:16.000 --> 1:37:18.000]  Let's talk another call about what's happening.
[1:37:18.000 --> 1:37:19.000]  Facebook censorship in Colorado.
[1:37:19.000 --> 1:37:20.000]  Eric, you're on the air.
[1:37:20.000 --> 1:37:21.000]  Go ahead.
[1:37:21.000 --> 1:37:24.000]  You know, you're right about censorship.
[1:37:24.000 --> 1:37:26.000]  It's not just happening on Twitter.
[1:37:26.000 --> 1:37:30.000]  It's happening on, if Donald Trump posts something on his Facebook site,
[1:37:30.000 --> 1:37:32.000]  it's just flooded with negative comments.
[1:37:32.000 --> 1:37:33.000]  Oh, yeah.
[1:37:33.000 --> 1:37:37.000]  They admit they've gauged it to not let any positive in where he can see it to make him
[1:37:37.000 --> 1:37:40.000]  feel like he doesn't have support, but Trump knows it's all being manipulated.
[1:37:40.000 --> 1:37:41.000]  He understands it.
[1:37:41.000 --> 1:37:45.000]  That's why he's saying, fine, I'm done with all of you and he's moving away to launch
[1:37:45.000 --> 1:37:46.000]  his own systems.
[1:37:46.000 --> 1:37:47.000]  Yeah.
[1:37:47.000 --> 1:37:50.000]  I'm using different platforms now and I'm trying to get everybody to leave Facebook.
[1:37:50.000 --> 1:37:54.000]  I'm saying, well, what you do is you raid Facebook and you,
[1:37:54.000 --> 1:37:56.000]  you point them at your, your operation.
[1:37:56.000 --> 1:38:00.000]  You set up your own website, which then points at other,
[1:38:00.000 --> 1:38:04.000]  other areas and other sites that are Patriot.
[1:38:04.000 --> 1:38:07.000]  And then you just let people know it's there for the exodus.
[1:38:07.000 --> 1:38:08.000]  You don't just leave.
[1:38:08.000 --> 1:38:11.000]  You take people like Moses didn't just leave.
[1:38:11.000 --> 1:38:12.000]  He took everybody with him.
[1:38:12.000 --> 1:38:13.000]  See what I mean?
[1:38:13.000 --> 1:38:14.000]  Yeah, that's exactly what I did.
[1:38:14.000 --> 1:38:16.000]  I have a radio show too that we do on Sunday night.
[1:38:16.000 --> 1:38:19.000]  And are we have a page on Facebook that we use to promote the show?
[1:38:19.000 --> 1:38:23.000]  And it was hard for me to think, how am I going to get out of Facebook to promote the show?
[1:38:23.000 --> 1:38:27.000]  And we found another place today, you know, where we could actually do a website off
[1:38:27.000 --> 1:38:30.000]  of Facebook so we can bypass Facebook all together.
[1:38:30.000 --> 1:38:31.000]  That's it.
[1:38:31.000 --> 1:38:32.000]  But, but don't just do that.
[1:38:32.000 --> 1:38:33.000]  What did I say?
[1:38:33.000 --> 1:38:38.000]  Create your own site, but go in and create new ones on Facebook to take everybody away.
[1:38:38.000 --> 1:38:39.000]  Yes.
[1:38:39.000 --> 1:38:40.000]  I appreciate your call.
[1:38:40.000 --> 1:38:41.000]  Sure.
[1:38:41.000 --> 1:38:42.000]  Yeah.
[1:38:42.000 --> 1:38:43.000]  And that's key.
[1:38:43.000 --> 1:38:44.000]  I've been through this one.
[1:38:44.000 --> 1:38:47.000]  It started out 21 years ago on AccessTV when they would do everything to shut me up.
[1:38:47.000 --> 1:38:49.000]  I mean, and I've been through the process.
[1:38:49.000 --> 1:38:50.000]  I've been fired repeatedly.
[1:38:50.000 --> 1:38:55.000]  I've been, believe me, use their platforms, have your own, like Drudge does.
[1:38:55.000 --> 1:38:58.000]  He has, you know, a Twitter and some other stuff, but it's all about his site.
[1:38:58.000 --> 1:39:00.000]  We had to do the same thing here.
[1:39:00.000 --> 1:39:05.000]  And that means support the big motherships out there, like what Trump's doing, what Drudge
[1:39:05.000 --> 1:39:10.000]  is doing, what I'm doing, support those because we're the big capital ships that their big
[1:39:10.000 --> 1:39:11.000]  guns are shooting at.
[1:39:11.000 --> 1:39:14.000]  And believe me, if they can blow us up, they're going to have some victories.
[1:39:14.000 --> 1:39:18.000]  The good luck is only get stronger as they attack us.
[1:39:18.000 --> 1:39:23.000]  It's like banning the sex pistols, you know, in England only made them superstars.
[1:39:23.000 --> 1:39:25.000]  We're not just acting cool like a bunch of teenagers.
[1:39:25.000 --> 1:39:27.000]  We're doing real stuff here.
[1:39:27.000 --> 1:39:31.000]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[1:39:31.000 --> 1:39:36.000]  Let's go ahead and talk to Catherine in Canada.
[1:39:36.000 --> 1:39:37.000]  Catherine, you're on the air.
[1:39:37.000 --> 1:39:39.000]  Go ahead.
[1:39:39.000 --> 1:39:40.000]  Hi, Alex.
[1:39:40.000 --> 1:39:41.000]  Welcome.
[1:39:41.000 --> 1:39:47.000]  Hey, I just, I watched Mike Pence's speech in Munich to the country's in NATO and he
[1:39:47.000 --> 1:39:50.000]  actually put the country's in NATO on like a reality check.
[1:39:50.000 --> 1:39:51.000]  Sure.
[1:39:51.000 --> 1:39:53.000]  Exactly, the media said, oh, he disagrees with Trump.
[1:39:53.000 --> 1:39:54.000]  He loves NATO.
[1:39:54.000 --> 1:39:55.000]  NATO is perfect.
[1:39:55.000 --> 1:39:56.000]  He wants to attack Russia.
[1:39:56.000 --> 1:40:00.000]  He said, we'll stand up to Russia if they do something wrong, but NATO, you're going
[1:40:00.000 --> 1:40:04.000]  to have to pay and you're not going to be able to sit here and just back up the EU and
[1:40:04.000 --> 1:40:05.000]  have a bunch of refugees pour in.
[1:40:05.000 --> 1:40:09.000]  He actually delivered what Trump said to deliver, but the media misrepresented what he said.
[1:40:09.000 --> 1:40:10.000]  Go ahead.
[1:40:10.000 --> 1:40:12.000]  Yeah, well, that was what I was going to say.
[1:40:12.000 --> 1:40:15.000]  He gave the countries, there's only about four countries in all of NATO that actually
[1:40:15.000 --> 1:40:16.000]  pay their share.
[1:40:16.000 --> 1:40:17.000]  Canada and US being one of them.
[1:40:17.000 --> 1:40:18.000]  I think Great Britain is the other.
[1:40:18.000 --> 1:40:23.000]  He gave them all to the end of the year to figure out a plan and their government to
[1:40:23.000 --> 1:40:24.000]  start paying.
[1:40:24.000 --> 1:40:29.000]  And then we're anti-NATO because the US doesn't want to pay 30%.
[1:40:29.000 --> 1:40:32.000]  Last time I looked UK like 10%, exactly.
[1:40:32.000 --> 1:40:33.000]  Canada like six.
[1:40:33.000 --> 1:40:36.000]  Why should we pay almost all of it like the United Nations?
[1:40:36.000 --> 1:40:37.000]  Why?
[1:40:37.000 --> 1:40:41.000]  Yeah, I want to know, what do you think their plan is to do to make the countries pay if
[1:40:41.000 --> 1:40:42.000]  they don't?
[1:40:42.000 --> 1:40:43.000]  I'm just wondering what you're taking.
[1:40:43.000 --> 1:40:44.000]  Well, here's the deal.
[1:40:44.000 --> 1:40:49.000]  We use the UN as a force for good if America that's founded it and funded it took control
[1:40:49.000 --> 1:40:50.000]  of it.
[1:40:50.000 --> 1:40:52.640]  I'm not somebody that just says, you know, don't use these things.
[1:40:52.640 --> 1:40:53.640]  We should.
[1:40:53.640 --> 1:40:54.640]  They're there.
[1:40:54.640 --> 1:40:55.640]  They're institutions.
[1:40:55.640 --> 1:40:56.640]  Reform them.
[1:40:56.640 --> 1:40:57.640]  It's like somebody's house.
[1:40:57.640 --> 1:40:58.640]  It's bad.
[1:40:58.640 --> 1:40:59.640]  You move in, you buy it, you make it better.
[1:40:59.640 --> 1:41:00.640]  We can perform an exorcism.
[1:41:00.640 --> 1:41:06.160]  I guess I'm being sarcastic, but absolutely, we should, we should just withdraw our funding
[1:41:06.160 --> 1:41:11.200]  and our military force from NATO, but they're not going to do that, but we never negotiate.
[1:41:11.200 --> 1:41:16.720]  All Trump's saying is, the days of having America sell itself out to special interests
[1:41:16.720 --> 1:41:21.920]  while we impoverish the people are over, plus it kills the base that creates the wealth.
[1:41:21.920 --> 1:41:26.520]  A real elite would want a big prosperous, you know, big, fat middle class.
[1:41:26.520 --> 1:41:30.520]  Yeah, I think he's going to, I think there's going to be a new alliance coming up with
[1:41:30.520 --> 1:41:34.000]  Japan, Canada, Australia wants to get on board, Great Britain, I think there's going
[1:41:34.000 --> 1:41:35.520]  to be a different type of alliance.
[1:41:35.520 --> 1:41:36.520]  Exactly.
[1:41:36.520 --> 1:41:40.000]  Because nobody ever challenged Goldman Sachs and a few big banks that, that the Rockefeller
[1:41:40.000 --> 1:41:45.120]  set up with this big mega system at the end of World War II, and the end of, you know,
[1:41:45.120 --> 1:41:49.280]  the whole program that was set up where we were the World Reserve currency, they built
[1:41:49.280 --> 1:41:54.760]  their corporate anti-human power off us, then they want to get rid of what gave them the
[1:41:54.760 --> 1:41:55.760]  power.
[1:41:55.760 --> 1:41:56.760]  No.
[1:41:56.760 --> 1:41:58.760]  What Trump's doing is a master stroke.
[1:41:58.760 --> 1:41:59.760]  Exactly.
[1:41:59.760 --> 1:42:02.600]  And I think that's why they're so worried about Russia, because they're going to be a big
[1:42:02.600 --> 1:42:04.800]  part too, being anti-New World Order.
[1:42:04.800 --> 1:42:11.840]  Well, Russia is, to quote Tony Montana, a great, big, giant country, three times the
[1:42:11.840 --> 1:42:17.520]  size of the U.S. with just amazing resources, ready to do great deals, empower their people,
[1:42:17.520 --> 1:42:18.720]  empower us.
[1:42:18.720 --> 1:42:21.920]  It's much better than China who doesn't have any resources and is overburdened with too
[1:42:21.920 --> 1:42:22.920]  many people.
[1:42:22.920 --> 1:42:27.800]  Most of the demographic experts, the demographers and others agree, Russia is the big juicy.
[1:42:27.800 --> 1:42:29.640]  Africa is not the big juicy.
[1:42:29.640 --> 1:42:31.040]  China is not the big juicy.
[1:42:31.040 --> 1:42:36.200]  The big juicy Marilyn Monroe that you want to get in bed with is Russia.
[1:42:36.200 --> 1:42:39.680]  And the globalists just want to exploit it, keep it poor, and kind of rip it off and all
[1:42:39.680 --> 1:42:40.680]  this.
[1:42:40.680 --> 1:42:41.680]  No.
[1:42:41.680 --> 1:42:46.200]  Let's just end all this crap and absolutely have this new system that will be a lot better
[1:42:46.200 --> 1:42:47.200]  for everybody.
[1:42:47.200 --> 1:42:50.680]  But see, this is a pro-human system so the globalists don't want it.
[1:42:50.680 --> 1:42:52.440]  The globalists want us weak.
[1:42:52.440 --> 1:42:55.360]  Trump wants us strong because he believes in humanity.
[1:42:55.360 --> 1:42:56.360]  He's not anti-human.
[1:42:56.360 --> 1:42:58.720]  More calls straight ahead.
[1:42:58.720 --> 1:43:03.800]  And Trump's administration on Wednesday night withdrew Obama's guidance on transgender
[1:43:03.800 --> 1:43:06.200]  bathroom use in public schools.
[1:43:06.200 --> 1:43:10.800]  Now radical liberals are calling for violent protests in the streets.
[1:43:10.800 --> 1:43:16.680]  George Sakai from the original Star Trek tweeted out, the Trump administration's war on the
[1:43:16.680 --> 1:43:19.440]  LGBT community has begun.
[1:43:19.440 --> 1:43:22.200]  Be prepared to take our fight to the street.
[1:43:22.200 --> 1:43:24.880]  Are you with us, LGBT allies?
[1:43:24.880 --> 1:43:26.280]  But he wasn't done.
[1:43:26.280 --> 1:43:30.440]  Years later, he tweeted that an American spring is coming.
[1:43:30.440 --> 1:43:35.880]  The radical left is demanding tolerance and threatening violence if they don't get special
[1:43:35.880 --> 1:43:38.720]  privileges in the name of tolerance.
[1:43:38.720 --> 1:43:43.400]  Yet they themselves practice extreme intolerance toward conservatives.
[1:43:43.400 --> 1:43:48.840]  So the question is, should we be tolerant toward their intolerance?
[1:43:48.840 --> 1:43:52.280]  Because after all, tolerance is a two-way street.
[1:43:52.280 --> 1:43:58.200]  This is Millie Weaver reporting for infowars.com.
[1:43:58.200 --> 1:44:02.480]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you

[1:44:59.040 --> 1:45:02.920]  It's not just our water we need to filter, it's not just our food that needs to be cleaned,
[1:45:02.920 --> 1:45:05.800]  it's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[1:45:05.800 --> 1:45:11.840]  The artificial particulates of the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[1:45:11.840 --> 1:45:16.800]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa pure groundbreaking
[1:45:16.800 --> 1:45:21.760]  water filtration systems have now developed Alexa pure breeze, whether it's your home
[1:45:21.760 --> 1:45:26.880]  or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children, to the best job
[1:45:26.880 --> 1:45:28.600]  you can to purify your air.
[1:45:28.600 --> 1:45:33.640]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate
[1:45:33.640 --> 1:45:38.800]  or avoid most toxic effects for themselves, the general public doesn't.
[1:45:38.800 --> 1:45:42.760]  The Alexa pure breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[1:45:42.760 --> 1:45:46.400]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[1:45:46.400 --> 1:45:49.960]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more
[1:45:49.960 --> 1:45:53.160]  expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[1:45:53.160 --> 1:45:57.080]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today, and then FullWarStore.com.
[1:45:57.080 --> 1:46:02.440]  Dr. Group, you developed Living Defense for us, it took you over a year to do it.
[1:46:02.440 --> 1:46:04.200]  Why is this so good?
[1:46:04.200 --> 1:46:08.880]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[1:46:08.880 --> 1:46:13.480]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in
[1:46:13.480 --> 1:46:19.200]  my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's
[1:46:19.200 --> 1:46:22.520]  harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[1:46:22.520 --> 1:46:27.600]  Right now with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare
[1:46:27.600 --> 1:46:28.880]  going on everywhere.
[1:46:28.880 --> 1:46:29.880]  These are all parasites.
[1:46:29.880 --> 1:46:32.600]  Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it.
[1:46:32.600 --> 1:46:36.920]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[1:46:36.920 --> 1:46:40.320]  I recommend doing the parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[1:46:40.320 --> 1:46:43.440]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[1:46:43.440 --> 1:46:44.440]  It just came back in yesterday.
[1:46:44.440 --> 1:46:45.440]  Living Defense, infowarslife.com.
[1:46:45.440 --> 1:46:50.200]  And folks, you can't lose, it's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[1:46:50.200 --> 1:46:53.480]  And you support the broadcast, infowarslife.com.
[1:46:53.480 --> 1:46:55.720]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[1:46:55.720 --> 1:47:25.360]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[1:47:26.720 --> 1:47:35.880]  Rolling Stone says, pray to Satan, imagine what they're praying against infowars right
[1:47:35.880 --> 1:47:41.000]  now that matter for every action is an equal and opposite reaction.
[1:47:41.000 --> 1:47:47.520]  So just pray for all our own salvation and protection and pray for God's will to be done
[1:47:47.520 --> 1:47:48.960]  on earth as it is in heaven.
[1:47:48.960 --> 1:47:55.520]  Why do you think the answer to 19 Melania prayed that you don't think they just announced
[1:47:55.520 --> 1:47:57.920]  these psychic and satanic attacks this week?
[1:47:57.920 --> 1:47:58.920]  They're already going on.
[1:47:58.920 --> 1:48:00.200]  Trump said, I know she'd say that.
[1:48:00.200 --> 1:48:01.200]  I know she'd do that.
[1:48:01.200 --> 1:48:03.960]  She immediately went up there and prayed the Lord's Prayer.
[1:48:03.960 --> 1:48:05.960]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[1:48:05.960 --> 1:48:07.200]  I want to go back to these calls.
[1:48:07.200 --> 1:48:10.960]  Got a bunch of them on a move quick through them, but that's the theme here is the spiritual
[1:48:10.960 --> 1:48:11.960]  attack.
[1:48:11.960 --> 1:48:15.240]  We are dealing with a bunch of devil worshipers in their own admissions.
[1:48:15.240 --> 1:48:19.400]  Let's play Melania because I didn't get to this clip where she talks about the Lord's
[1:48:19.400 --> 1:48:23.480]  Prayer and recites it and Trump had no idea it was about to happen.
[1:48:23.480 --> 1:48:27.920]  And then a week later, all over the news, they're saying, kill Trump, pray for his death.
[1:48:27.920 --> 1:48:33.800]  Pray that he died and fall into ashes, engage in voodoo, Satanism, pray that demons come
[1:48:33.800 --> 1:48:36.320]  out of hell, the other dimension to hurt Trump.
[1:48:36.320 --> 1:48:41.320]  Don't you get that if you believe in that and no history, you get sevenfold what happens
[1:48:41.320 --> 1:48:42.320]  to Trump.
[1:48:42.320 --> 1:48:47.240]  They get a bunch of idiots that grew up watching Harry Potter to think this is a joke.
[1:48:47.240 --> 1:48:51.280]  You're like a psychic creature that has DNA that resonates with the universe.
[1:48:51.280 --> 1:48:54.120]  You start doing this, you destroy yourself.
[1:48:54.120 --> 1:48:58.640]  They're trying to get you, their followers, to open yourselves up to incredible evil.
[1:48:58.640 --> 1:49:04.200]  Whether you love Trump or not, these are people asking you to basically be demon food if you
[1:49:04.200 --> 1:49:06.880]  believe in all this stuff.
[1:49:06.880 --> 1:49:07.880]  What happens to witches?
[1:49:07.880 --> 1:49:09.600]  How's this fall on them?
[1:49:09.600 --> 1:49:10.600]  Everybody knows that.
[1:49:10.600 --> 1:49:11.600]  We've all seen what happens.
[1:49:11.600 --> 1:49:18.560]  I'll get you and your little dog too because these things must be done delicately.
[1:49:18.560 --> 1:49:19.560]  Here is Melania.
[1:49:19.560 --> 1:49:29.680]  Let us pray, our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed by thy name, thy kingdom come, thy
[1:49:29.680 --> 1:49:37.800]  will be done, on earth as it is in heaven, give us these days our daily bread and forgive
[1:49:37.800 --> 1:49:47.680]  us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us and lead us not into temptation
[1:49:47.680 --> 1:49:55.960]  but deliver us from evil, for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory, forever
[1:49:55.960 --> 1:49:56.960]  and ever.
[1:49:56.960 --> 1:49:57.960]  Amen.
[1:49:57.960 --> 1:50:04.360]  Yeah, that'll walk through this shadow of the valley of death or walk through the valley
[1:50:04.360 --> 1:50:06.680]  of the shadow of death off here in the evil.
[1:50:06.680 --> 1:50:09.160]  By the way, I love how Trump, it says later, I didn't know she was here.
[1:50:09.160 --> 1:50:10.160]  That's great.
[1:50:10.160 --> 1:50:13.400]  Trump, if he just believes in somebody, whether it's somebody in the crowd or his wife, he
[1:50:13.400 --> 1:50:14.880]  just says, come up.
[1:50:14.880 --> 1:50:22.560]  It's not scripted, he knows the magic is in what's real, so do I.
[1:50:22.560 --> 1:50:31.160]  Let's go ahead and talk to Connie in New York, go ahead, then we'll go to Connie.
[1:50:31.160 --> 1:50:36.960]  Great to talk to you, Alex, sorry for the cold.
[1:50:36.960 --> 1:50:42.160]  First of all, I love your brain force, knockout, bio defense, I get a subscription and I just
[1:50:42.160 --> 1:50:44.400]  love everything that you tell me.
[1:50:44.400 --> 1:50:49.880]  I want to say that I pray for Trump so hard, it's like a constant mantra, I've gone to
[1:50:49.880 --> 1:50:50.880]  it.
[1:50:50.880 --> 1:50:52.720]  And do you see how strong he's getting because of it?
[1:50:52.720 --> 1:50:56.680]  Oh, I'm so grateful and I know that other people are praying for him too and I think
[1:50:56.680 --> 1:50:59.360]  it's one of the most important ways that we can help.
[1:50:59.360 --> 1:51:03.720]  Let me just say, the times I've talked to Trump is that he talks about the spirit, he
[1:51:03.720 --> 1:51:07.960]  talks about God, he talks about helping Christians have free speech, he talks about
[1:51:07.960 --> 1:51:08.960]  do you feel it, Alex?
[1:51:08.960 --> 1:51:10.720]  Do you feel God, the spirit coming back?
[1:51:10.720 --> 1:51:12.240]  I mean, that's what he talks about.
[1:51:12.240 --> 1:51:16.680]  Those are private discussions, I shouldn't say that, but folks need to know that Trump
[1:51:16.680 --> 1:51:21.320]  really is a Christian, he's just not going to be a hypocrite, but the Holy Spirit is
[1:51:21.320 --> 1:51:22.320]  on Trump.
[1:51:22.320 --> 1:51:26.840]  And so Trump feels it when you're praying for him and that's why the enemy knows it.
[1:51:26.840 --> 1:51:30.920]  They know that he's really now just coming into the anointing.
[1:51:30.920 --> 1:51:36.360]  Yep, I've had a mass card sent to him, I'm going to up it, I'm going to up the level
[1:51:36.360 --> 1:51:37.360]  of the ante.
[1:51:37.360 --> 1:51:42.200]  And besides that, I just want to ask you, I get these things from you, but I'm not
[1:51:42.200 --> 1:51:47.240]  willing to go to the next level and just pay, you know, to support you monthly.
[1:51:47.240 --> 1:51:50.320]  So if you can make that bigger, I think there are many more of us that will do it, put it
[1:51:50.320 --> 1:51:51.320]  on each person.
[1:51:51.320 --> 1:51:54.040]  Absolutely, because the attacks are substantive and they're increasing exponentially.
[1:51:54.040 --> 1:51:56.800]  I don't want to give an attention, but it's just bad.
[1:51:56.800 --> 1:52:00.720]  We have donation page at infowars.com forward slash show.
[1:52:00.720 --> 1:52:04.560]  We should start up like a monthly deal, kind of like auto ship on the products.
[1:52:04.560 --> 1:52:08.000]  If you people want to donate a dollar, $10, whatever, for the mission, we're going to
[1:52:08.000 --> 1:52:12.680]  set that up and have these pledge drives to get the more reporters hired and also stand
[1:52:12.680 --> 1:52:13.840]  against the attacks.
[1:52:13.840 --> 1:52:14.840]  So God bless you.
[1:52:14.840 --> 1:52:17.840]  And I don't want to be selfish, but for my family, please thank you for the prayers.
[1:52:17.840 --> 1:52:25.200]  You know, my grandmother, who prayed for me hours a day of squad, she's not in this
[1:52:25.200 --> 1:52:28.640]  plane anymore and I can feel her loss, her strength.
[1:52:28.640 --> 1:52:33.360]  So I need those prayers because at all the prayers, my grandmother was connected to was
[1:52:33.360 --> 1:52:36.960]  so strong, she's connected to me, she's gone, she died a few weeks ago.
[1:52:36.960 --> 1:52:38.180]  I need that.
[1:52:38.180 --> 1:52:39.680]  I need that.
[1:52:39.680 --> 1:52:44.160]  And so thank you for the prayers, but the children and the innocents that are being
[1:52:44.160 --> 1:52:47.040]  attacked, they need the prayers more than anybody.
[1:52:47.040 --> 1:52:48.920]  And so just thank you for your prayers as well.
[1:52:48.920 --> 1:52:53.040]  We should all pray for each other and pray for people that just want justice and who don't
[1:52:53.040 --> 1:52:54.480]  want death upon the planet.
[1:52:54.480 --> 1:52:58.400]  Doesn't mean we're up on big high horses or anything, but we're so meek that we never
[1:52:58.400 --> 1:53:02.320]  just pray for each other and pray for everybody to stand for what's right because you look
[1:53:02.320 --> 1:53:03.320]  at the enemy.
[1:53:03.320 --> 1:53:04.320]  They're wicked.
[1:53:04.320 --> 1:53:05.320]  They want to fall in world.
[1:53:05.320 --> 1:53:08.160]  They want somebody that isn't like them because misery loves company.
[1:53:08.160 --> 1:53:09.520]  I apologize for breaking down.
[1:53:09.520 --> 1:53:14.200]  It's just, these are the energy level on the planet is just escalating and the enemy can
[1:53:14.200 --> 1:53:15.200]  feel it.
[1:53:15.200 --> 1:53:17.520]  It's why they're just absolutely in fear right now.
[1:53:17.520 --> 1:53:20.720]  Let's go ahead and talk to Don in Seattle.
[1:53:20.720 --> 1:53:21.720]  You're on the air.
[1:53:21.720 --> 1:53:22.720]  Go ahead.
[1:53:22.720 --> 1:53:23.720]  Thank you, Alex.
[1:53:23.720 --> 1:53:30.720]  First of all, I'd like to thank you for the making available of the survival shield X2.
[1:53:30.720 --> 1:53:33.120]  It has literally changed my life.
[1:53:33.120 --> 1:53:36.720]  Well, it's a good halogen, all the bad ones, they dump in the water, so it fills up your
[1:53:36.720 --> 1:53:37.720]  thyroid.
[1:53:37.720 --> 1:53:38.720]  It's amazing.
[1:53:38.720 --> 1:53:39.720]  Thank you.
[1:53:39.720 --> 1:53:44.160]  Well, it's more than just the water out here, brother.
[1:53:44.160 --> 1:53:46.840]  The radiation out here in the West Coast is unbelievable.
[1:53:46.840 --> 1:53:47.840]  It's expanding.
[1:53:47.840 --> 1:53:49.880]  They don't know why it's higher than Chernobyl in Europe right now.
[1:53:49.880 --> 1:53:52.040]  They don't know what's going on.
[1:53:52.040 --> 1:53:55.600]  Radiation in the Northern Hemisphere is just going up and up.
[1:53:55.600 --> 1:54:02.920]  Anyway, on the spiritual battle, I'd like to thank Trump for having the courage to bring
[1:54:02.920 --> 1:54:07.360]  out the evil that is going on.
[1:54:07.360 --> 1:54:14.200]  The pedophilia that has been going on for eons, and it needs to stop.
[1:54:14.200 --> 1:54:15.200]  It really does.
[1:54:15.200 --> 1:54:18.120]  Yeah, it's the sucking of the life force of the child.
[1:54:18.120 --> 1:54:22.320]  Every ancient culture would sacrifice children, and then it just became child rape.
[1:54:22.320 --> 1:54:24.480]  That's why the enemy's so upset with what we're doing.
[1:54:24.480 --> 1:54:25.520]  Trump is moving forward.
[1:54:25.520 --> 1:54:27.720]  God bless you, and thank you for the support, sir.
[1:54:27.720 --> 1:54:30.760]  I'm very humbled by it.
[1:54:30.760 --> 1:54:33.000]  Let's talk to Ryan and Pittsburgh and Carlos.
[1:54:33.000 --> 1:54:34.000]  Go ahead, Ryan.
[1:54:34.000 --> 1:54:35.000]  You're on the air.
[1:54:35.000 --> 1:54:36.000]  I'll tell you what, Alex.
[1:54:36.000 --> 1:54:37.000]  Do not change.
[1:54:37.000 --> 1:54:39.440]  It's your passion that's keeping me listening.
[1:54:39.440 --> 1:54:45.280]  I've been listening to you for a year, first-time caller, because your passion and your enthusiasm
[1:54:45.280 --> 1:54:52.480]  is what's really the big key to what's going on here.
[1:54:52.480 --> 1:54:56.040]  If everyone had the same passion as you, we'd already be winning.
[1:54:56.040 --> 1:54:57.040]  Trust me.
[1:54:57.040 --> 1:55:00.000]  Well, even Town Hall's reporting when I reported on a month ago.
[1:55:00.000 --> 1:55:05.360]  Why is MSM ignoring sex traffic bust all over the country by thousands of people with kids
[1:55:05.360 --> 1:55:09.440]  in dungeons, you name it, because they're all basically Democrats, and they're trying
[1:55:09.440 --> 1:55:13.240]  to cover it up and focus on Milo, who got raped when he was a teenager, like he's the
[1:55:13.240 --> 1:55:14.240]  big bad guy.
[1:55:14.240 --> 1:55:16.520]  What do you make of that?
[1:55:16.520 --> 1:55:20.800]  Well, they're not going to, even if we can't defeat him right now, or in two years, five
[1:55:20.800 --> 1:55:24.080]  years, they're going to get what's coming to them in the end.
[1:55:24.080 --> 1:55:25.080]  Absolutely.
[1:55:25.080 --> 1:55:28.720]  That's what we should all know, is don't fear those that can kill the body.
[1:55:28.720 --> 1:55:31.600]  Fear God, because you're not with God, you're soul.
[1:55:31.600 --> 1:55:32.600]  This is all real, folks.
[1:55:32.600 --> 1:55:34.720]  We're on a planet in deep space.
[1:55:34.720 --> 1:55:37.720]  The enemy wants to keep you focused on TV and stupid stuff.
[1:55:37.720 --> 1:55:38.720]  Look around you.
[1:55:38.720 --> 1:55:43.000]  I mean, God said, look at the heavens, you know I'm real, and just tune into that and
[1:55:43.000 --> 1:55:45.400]  know we're going to defeat them.
[1:55:45.400 --> 1:55:47.280]  Carlos and Montreal, Canada, go ahead.
[1:55:47.280 --> 1:55:48.280]  You're on the air.
[1:55:48.280 --> 1:55:49.280]  Thanks for holding.
[1:55:49.280 --> 1:55:50.280]  Thank you very much.
[1:55:50.280 --> 1:55:53.920]  We're with you and with President Trump.
[1:55:53.920 --> 1:56:01.080]  When facing a challenge, the natural reaction is for adrenaline to come out and give us focus.
[1:56:01.080 --> 1:56:07.240]  And I think it's important that looking from outside, the focus, in my opinion, should
[1:56:07.240 --> 1:56:11.440]  be to restore freedom to the American people.
[1:56:11.440 --> 1:56:16.480]  Freedom has been lost, because every conversation, you have to watch your words, because you
[1:56:16.480 --> 1:56:17.480]  don't know who's listening.
[1:56:17.480 --> 1:56:21.400]  And we should ignore that, but I agree, restore a beachhead here, spread it worldwide, not
[1:56:21.400 --> 1:56:23.200]  by force, but by culture.
[1:56:23.200 --> 1:56:24.680]  Exactly.
[1:56:24.680 --> 1:56:30.760]  And if you look at, for instance, Ed Snowden's contribution, his contribution was to alert
[1:56:30.760 --> 1:56:37.440]  us to the fact that leaders abroad, Americans were being listened to their conversations.
[1:56:37.440 --> 1:56:41.800]  Everything, apparently, over time we've found out, is being recorded, so that means that
[1:56:41.800 --> 1:56:46.200]  a young person wanting to be president one day could find himself in future with some
[1:56:46.200 --> 1:56:47.200]  TV station.
[1:56:47.200 --> 1:56:48.200]  Exactly.
[1:56:48.200 --> 1:56:52.040]  It's about blackmail in the future, releasing when somebody said when they were 20 at a
[1:56:52.040 --> 1:56:58.040]  frat party, exactly, absolutely, this is very important what you're saying.
[1:56:58.040 --> 1:57:03.560]  So I hope that if President Trump, and I mean that in the sense of what you started your
[1:57:03.560 --> 1:57:09.140]  discussion with, if President Trump wants to unite Americans, he does so, he brings
[1:57:09.140 --> 1:57:12.280]  up God to unite us, then they talk about the devil.
[1:57:12.280 --> 1:57:17.240]  He brings up priests and then the religious people, then they talk about the witches.
[1:57:17.240 --> 1:57:22.400]  President Trump wants to unite Americans, please restore to Americans their privacy.
[1:57:22.400 --> 1:57:23.400]  Take the NSA.
[1:57:23.400 --> 1:57:24.400]  I agree.
[1:57:24.400 --> 1:57:28.160]  If he does that and invites a bunch of the real leftists that have been against all this
[1:57:28.160 --> 1:57:30.640]  in and unifies the people, they'll fall.
[1:57:30.640 --> 1:57:31.640]  All right, great point.
[1:57:31.640 --> 1:57:33.160]  Well, I know the Trump folks are listening.
[1:57:33.160 --> 1:57:34.160]  Thank you so much.
[1:57:34.160 --> 1:57:35.160]  I appreciate you.
[1:57:35.160 --> 1:57:36.160]  Sorry to all of their callers.
[1:57:36.160 --> 1:57:37.160]  I'll call you back tomorrow.
[1:57:37.160 --> 1:57:38.160]  Lord willing, we'll be here.
[1:57:38.160 --> 1:57:39.160]  11 a.m. Central.
[1:57:39.160 --> 1:57:40.960]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[1:57:40.960 --> 1:57:45.280]  They're trying to shut us down, spread those links, because we're an integral part.
[1:57:45.280 --> 1:57:48.280]  Thank you all and great job of the crew.
[1:57:48.280 --> 1:57:54.680]  We're selling a product DNA force that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce
[1:57:54.680 --> 1:57:55.680]  about a group.
[1:57:55.680 --> 1:57:58.000]  You took years for you to develop DNA force for us.
[1:57:58.000 --> 1:58:01.440]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think
[1:58:01.440 --> 1:58:03.640]  it's very, very important.
[1:58:03.640 --> 1:58:10.280]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[1:58:10.280 --> 1:58:13.840]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes, but when it runs out, you
[1:58:13.840 --> 1:58:14.840]  start dying.
[1:58:14.840 --> 1:58:18.960]  There's a PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[1:58:18.960 --> 1:58:21.840]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[1:58:21.840 --> 1:58:23.520]  It works like an antioxidant.
[1:58:23.520 --> 1:58:26.320]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[1:58:26.320 --> 1:58:29.600]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[1:58:29.600 --> 1:58:30.600]  It's in powder form.
[1:58:30.600 --> 1:58:33.320]  We have so many five star reviews.
[1:58:33.320 --> 1:58:34.320]  I take this.
[1:58:34.320 --> 1:58:36.320]  This is this is the product that I take.
