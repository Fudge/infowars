[00:00.000 --> 00:15.800]  If you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance from the front lines of
[00:15.800 --> 00:19.680]  the information war it's Alex Jones.
[00:19.680 --> 00:28.520]  It's before the day of August on this Thursday edition 2016 I'm your host Alex Jones and
[00:28.520 --> 00:37.840]  everyone I talk to including mainline liberals are blown away by the wall-to-wall lies and
[00:37.840 --> 00:46.200]  disinformation being launched against the Republican Party nominee Donald J. Trump.
[00:46.200 --> 00:49.360]  They floated this months ago that he was going to drop out of the race and he comes
[00:49.360 --> 00:51.640]  out and says I've never talked about it it's not happening.
[00:51.640 --> 00:55.480]  They floated it months ago that his kids didn't like him and that his campaign was falling
[00:55.480 --> 00:57.920]  apart none of it was true.
[00:57.920 --> 01:03.000]  And now they've come out I was watching cable news last night and went through like seven
[01:03.000 --> 01:08.160]  or eight channels and I would basically finish the sentence as I would flip as they kept
[01:08.160 --> 01:14.160]  saying oh he might take a payoff to drop out of a hundred and fifty million insiders tell
[01:14.160 --> 01:22.080]  us oh he's dropping out oh Hillary's twenty points ahead now on and on and on and then
[01:22.080 --> 01:26.480]  by the day it's just oh what would happen if he did.
[01:26.480 --> 01:32.520]  No one has pointed this out we're doing a story about it I shot a video this morning
[01:32.520 --> 01:40.000]  on it remember what happened to Iowa when Ben Carson at about five thirty in the afternoon
[01:40.000 --> 01:47.280]  knew he was in second place got on an airplane to fly to Florida to start campaigning and
[01:47.280 --> 01:51.480]  they went on the news Ted Cruz's people and tweeted out that well Ben just told us he's
[01:51.480 --> 01:58.600]  dropping out he's flying home and then later they had to admit they did it as a dirty trick
[01:58.600 --> 02:02.160]  and he fired the campaign head that supposedly did it.
[02:02.160 --> 02:09.360]  This is the Republican Party inside with the mainstream media putting this out they just
[02:09.360 --> 02:13.240]  come out and say oh Trump's dropping out did you hear or oh the Koch brothers might give
[02:13.240 --> 02:16.800]  him a hundred and fifty million dollars and Trump comes out and says it's totally untrue
[02:16.800 --> 02:25.880]  in fact I pulled up a Politico article you just type in Trump not dropping out I pulled
[02:25.880 --> 02:34.600]  up an article from over a month ago on six nineteen sixteen would Donald Trump really
[02:34.600 --> 02:38.920]  drop out for a hundred and fifty million and then they just admit it's total speculation
[02:38.920 --> 02:41.920]  they have been putting this out and then Donald Trump says in the article please print it for
[02:41.920 --> 02:48.560]  me guys he says this is the lies of Politico how dare you make this up but then I saw articles
[02:48.560 --> 02:54.920]  today saying Trump won't deny he won't take a hundred fifty million they are preying on
[02:54.920 --> 02:59.760]  the public just like they did with Ben Carson saying he gave up he's given up it's over
[02:59.760 --> 03:05.760]  he can't win and then I have all the articles here admitting that Reuters and others go
[03:05.760 --> 03:10.640]  out as soon as Trump got ten points ahead a few weeks ago and they will sample ten to
[03:10.640 --> 03:15.320]  fifteen percent Reuters admits it I'm going to show you the graphs you're a TV viewer
[03:15.320 --> 03:21.640]  from them where they go out and they sample ten to fifteen percent depending on the poll
[03:21.640 --> 03:28.880]  more Democrats and then suddenly claims she's ahead well of course if you get fifteen percent
[03:28.880 --> 03:35.320]  more Democrats I mean I could go out and sample just Democrats and claim it's a poll and you
[03:35.320 --> 03:41.840]  know say that Trump is going to get three thousand percent if I wanted to or that Hillary
[03:41.840 --> 03:45.840]  is going to get three thousand percent six hundred fifty Democrats is who they sample
[03:45.840 --> 03:52.680]  and then Republicans four hundred ninety six you see that that's like fifteen percent
[03:52.680 --> 03:58.360]  more Democrats this is how they operate and it's never before been seen like this with
[03:58.360 --> 04:04.920]  this this level of out of control corruption now the truth is Hillary Clinton is acting
[04:04.920 --> 04:10.440]  completely mentally ill and completely insane Bill Clinton looks completely out of his mind
[04:10.440 --> 04:20.200]  and like somebody out of a horror movie he looks like a zombie he looks like he's dead
[04:20.200 --> 04:25.800]  like he's Lazarus the video is up on info wars dot com poll watchings done a report
[04:25.800 --> 04:32.320]  on this and he links to the experts and others that are saying she is obviously completely
[04:32.320 --> 04:37.520]  out of her mind and that's not hype with us you can look at her and look at the statements
[04:37.520 --> 04:44.440]  I mean she is cuckoo or cocoa puffs and you imagine if she gets in steals the election
[04:44.440 --> 04:49.400]  is in control the nuclear codes I just have a really bad feeling about this I've never
[04:49.400 --> 04:52.760]  been more concerned I'm not really afraid of her I mean if God wants the earth to get
[04:52.760 --> 04:56.560]  nuked and all of us to die that's God's issue and maybe Hillary Clinton is the judgment
[04:56.560 --> 05:03.040]  I had a whore of revelation so what do we know about Kaseer Khan that Muslim gold star
[05:03.040 --> 05:07.240]  father the Democrats have rolled out to try and stump Trump well as Breitbart News and
[05:07.240 --> 05:12.020]  others have reported his now deleted website proves that he financially benefits from
[05:12.020 --> 05:16.600]  unfettered pay to play Muslim migration into America but remember when he whipped out his
[05:16.600 --> 05:21.680]  pocket constitution well it turns out that Khan has actually published papers supporting
[05:21.680 --> 05:27.720]  the supremacy of Islamic law over man-made Western law Breitbart reports that in 1983
[05:27.720 --> 05:33.000]  for example Khan wrote a glowing review of a book human rights in Islam Khan speaks
[05:33.000 --> 05:37.160]  admiringly of the interpretation of human rights in the book even though it includes
[05:37.160 --> 05:42.120]  the right to kill and mutilate those who violate Islamic laws and even the right of men to
[05:42.120 --> 05:47.680]  beat wives who act unseemly and in a separate academic paper juristic classification of
[05:47.680 --> 05:53.800]  Islamic law Khan argues that all other judicial works must always be subordinated to the Sharia
[05:53.800 --> 05:57.960]  so just because he's read his pocket constitution doesn't mean he agrees with it.
[05:57.960 --> 06:27.240]  Me and Makadu for info wars dot com.

[09:06.760 --> 09:12.160]  has come out and said that hillary clinton is the founder of isis we put that report
[09:12.160 --> 09:17.840]  out three years ago because she was the founder of isis and that's what's got the establishment
[09:17.840 --> 09:23.360]  so scared they know trump is dialed in to the info war he doesn't get his information
[09:23.360 --> 09:28.560]  from us he knows our information is accurate and I've actually known this for a long time
[09:28.560 --> 09:33.440]  the enemies finally figured it out and is in full panic mode and I'm not trying to ingratiate
[09:33.440 --> 09:38.000]  us with the public and say oh look how big info wars is I'm telling you what we've been
[09:38.000 --> 09:45.360]  basically keeping secret for a while but there's no point in doing that now this information
[09:45.360 --> 09:53.760]  is liquid death to the new world order it is poison it's the blood of life to liberty
[09:53.760 --> 10:01.200]  it is death coffin nails the globalist we understand their program we understand their
[10:01.200 --> 10:09.840]  players we understand their operations trump has set the stage to expose election fraud
[10:09.840 --> 10:15.840]  just as he blocked the attempt to steal the primary from him that has got them in full
[10:15.840 --> 10:23.600]  pull their hair out panic mode white house press conferences foreign leaders the pope
[10:23.600 --> 10:30.000]  the communist chinese all saying you better not elect trump and you turn on cnn even fox
[10:30.000 --> 10:41.280]  msnbc abc news it is over the top compared to their over the top lies just a week ago it is
[10:41.280 --> 10:47.760]  exponential deception and it goes along with them covering up the latest jihad attack in
[10:47.760 --> 10:53.040]  london one dead five injured stab as he screamed a la agba and ices takes credit
[10:53.040 --> 11:00.960]  and ices supporters celebrate russell square terror attack and the islamic mayor says be
[11:00.960 --> 11:09.120]  calm do what you're told we have total economic collapse happening in many areas of the world
[11:09.120 --> 11:13.840]  the economic collapse of venezuela is so bad that people are slaughtering and eating zoo animals
[11:14.800 --> 11:20.080]  that's the wonders of communism we've got the latest on our economy here we've got politico
[11:20.080 --> 11:28.000]  trying to claim that donald trump's wife was an illegal alien or did something wrong we've
[11:28.000 --> 11:34.240]  got clinton eastwood coming out says that he's challenging obama's pussy generation just effing
[11:34.240 --> 11:42.480]  it over it i don't normally paraphrase profanity here on air but when clinton eastwood says that
[11:42.480 --> 11:51.280]  it's not profanity now let's let's get to the heart of the issues here i'm going to go over
[11:51.920 --> 12:03.440]  not just news but the actual polls that roiders and others are giving to the respondents and they
[12:03.440 --> 12:12.800]  begin with generally 15 but but the lowest 10 percent more democrat respondents in a poll now
[12:12.800 --> 12:20.400]  you're supposed to if you're gonna poll people you do it randomly or you do it 50 50 of registered
[12:20.400 --> 12:25.600]  voters this this has never before been done they've got phone lists and target lists where they
[12:25.600 --> 12:29.200]  really know there's more democrats that's how they do these spin polls how they create the
[12:29.200 --> 12:33.680]  perception that trumps behind he was seven to ten points ahead even with their cook polls
[12:33.680 --> 12:37.440]  so they came out two weeks ago trying to put in these fake polls out and we've talked about it
[12:38.640 --> 12:43.920]  but it's being done at a level never before seen where they just admit they're sampling
[12:46.320 --> 12:53.680]  650 something democrats versus 400 something republicans obviously that's going to create
[12:53.680 --> 12:59.120]  10-point leads for hillary clinton bare minimum this is not rocket science
[13:01.520 --> 13:09.200]  and you got to ask yourself the dying enemy media where is it going next because
[13:09.200 --> 13:25.280]  yesterday i was here monitoring news here in austin and then traveled to a nearby city to do research
[13:27.520 --> 13:32.480]  and i was monitoring more news than i normally do because i wasn't on air and i was collating news
[13:32.480 --> 13:37.360]  articles and data for special reports and things we're putting out about election fraud about the
[13:37.360 --> 13:42.640]  fake polls about the rigging of google blocking donald trump's name from the presidential selection
[13:42.640 --> 13:47.840]  when people do research again unprecedented stuff beyond the old soviet union
[13:50.160 --> 13:57.120]  and every radio channel every tv channel was saying donald trump's dropping out have you heard
[13:57.120 --> 14:02.880]  and then i heard people on the street talking about it first it was he is dropping out i go look
[14:02.880 --> 14:07.600]  trump says it's not true i find out over a month ago politico came out and said he was going to be
[14:07.600 --> 14:16.000]  paid 150 million to drop out total bully says he responds to them on twitter and says you are
[14:16.000 --> 14:21.520]  totally full of deception you are liars asked about whether trump would drop out another former
[14:21.520 --> 14:26.880]  trump advisor jim doran so he believes he might but then oh it's here from trump down here trump
[14:26.880 --> 14:34.080]  himself says it's ridiculous proposition and that it's not a fan of the question the story is a
[14:34.080 --> 14:39.200]  total fabrication from you and politico as usual the new york billionaire sent an email sent by his
[14:39.200 --> 14:48.320]  campaign manager and then it goes on from there i will never leave the race nobody has enough
[14:48.320 --> 14:53.760]  money to pay me to leave the race and if they did it would be totally illegal anyways did obama and
[14:53.760 --> 14:59.840]  the clintons get you to write this garbage and now we have the emails this came this came out
[14:59.840 --> 15:07.440]  before the emails two weeks before where they are directing politico and abc news and cnn you got
[15:07.440 --> 15:14.000]  wolf blitzer up there singing and dancing drinking champagne when hillary's up there acting like a
[15:14.000 --> 15:25.440]  mental patient swatting at balloons the archetypal creeping witch in fact this is getting so
[15:25.440 --> 15:30.320]  fantastical we're seeing an elite meltdown and burn down right now whatever happens with this
[15:30.320 --> 15:37.760]  election the anglo-american establishment's done they have blown it all out they've discredited
[15:37.760 --> 15:43.920]  themselves you could say the mainstream media is now dead it's over you have a six percent
[15:43.920 --> 15:51.600]  trust rate in national polls ap you already know that but you really i guess had nothing to lose
[15:51.600 --> 15:57.520]  now that you're all discredited with a bunch of lackeys and weirdos in your cult that thinks you
[15:57.520 --> 16:02.560]  can tell us we didn't build our businesses and families are bad and we're evil because we're
[16:02.560 --> 16:08.800]  hardworking you are disconnected from reality obama's out in a new video clip we're gonna be playing
[16:10.400 --> 16:15.280]  where he talks about uh anti-government people just need to leave america because it's the
[16:15.280 --> 16:18.400]  government that created all the industry and all the jobs
[16:21.920 --> 16:26.960]  like general motors no it was the government that that bailed out the corrupt corporations
[16:26.960 --> 16:33.760]  that did pump and dumps the government is not the reason we had some prosperity it was limited
[16:33.760 --> 16:38.560]  freedom and limited innovation and limited capacity to have a little more freedom in other nations
[16:40.080 --> 16:47.760]  if government delivered heaven on earth and nirvana and valhalla cloud nine then they wouldn't be
[16:47.760 --> 16:58.160]  eating the zoo animals in venezuela as venezuela collapses into zombie land venezuela is now hell
[16:58.160 --> 17:11.600]  on earth and get ready for it here down the road and then after they've looted every farm
[17:11.600 --> 17:16.960]  looted every business after the socialists have brought the country down the elites have already
[17:16.960 --> 17:22.320]  moved out life will start back over again i don't know how many years down the road this is but
[17:22.320 --> 17:28.640]  we're a far way a far cry from the bottom of the rat hole yet but don't worry it'll be a long
[17:28.640 --> 17:35.040]  arduous painful humiliating stinking fall with the rise of ignorance and deception
[17:35.040 --> 17:43.840]  already we rival mexico for kidnappings and every other form of slovenly
[17:46.160 --> 17:49.040]  corruption and meanwhile
[17:51.840 --> 17:57.520]  they come out in the last 24 hours massive 2016 campaign shakeup trump to be replaced
[18:00.800 --> 18:04.640]  that's what politico the new york times everybody was saying first it was he is being
[18:04.640 --> 18:11.760]  replaced did you hear he quit just like ben carson in iowa he gets on a plane 5 30 that
[18:11.760 --> 18:15.440]  afternoon all right i'm going to the next state we're in second place in the polls looks like
[18:15.440 --> 18:19.760]  we're gonna maybe the nominee and then out comes the rhino republican establishment
[18:20.480 --> 18:25.280]  ted cruz people put out the fact oh we just talked to him he's giving up he quit he threw it in
[18:25.280 --> 18:30.240]  he's in a two hour flight during the two hours he drops in the polls people stop voting for him at
[18:30.240 --> 18:37.680]  the key voting time ted cruz gets in ted cruz gets second place and it's the same thing we see here
[18:37.680 --> 18:46.320]  did you hear did you hear trump quit and trumps come out repeatedly and said this is preposterous
[18:46.320 --> 18:50.160]  as i've been saying for months this is a talking point but now the whole media is pushing it it's
[18:50.160 --> 18:54.400]  all lies and none of them will say on the news that trump has come out and said it's not true
[18:54.400 --> 19:04.000]  true they lie and then won't even let you hear him say it was a lie you know this criminal media
[19:04.000 --> 19:10.080]  is going to go along with banker bailouts bank holidays in nationalization of labor like they've
[19:10.080 --> 19:16.880]  done in in venezuela we're going to be in a living hell with these people they just keep lying and
[19:16.880 --> 19:22.400]  lying and lying could donald trump drop out some better seem to think so new york times today

[19:45.040 --> 19:53.120]  hillary yes here it is g.o.p officials exploring options if trump drops out but we've got big

[24:26.160 --> 24:33.440]  there's been massive coverage in the last 24 hours in the mainstream media claiming that
[24:33.440 --> 24:39.760]  donald trump is planning to drop out now trump has come out and said that he never said this
[24:39.760 --> 24:46.080]  there's not permerall in his campaign and that it's not true but the msm from politico to the
[24:46.080 --> 24:52.560]  new york times says that they do have the sources and that it's happening so you can just forget
[24:52.560 --> 24:57.280]  about voting for trump he's not going to be on the ballot the republicans are going to replace him
[24:57.280 --> 25:02.400]  doesn't matter that that's completely illegal and they couldn't do it they're just telling us this
[25:02.400 --> 25:08.000]  now they earlier tried to say that it didn't matter if he won the states by landslides california
[25:08.000 --> 25:14.400]  by 78 points that still it would be given to ted cruz but for some reason voters didn't support
[25:14.400 --> 25:21.360]  that so they had to back off but ladies and gentlemen here is the big announcement and we
[25:21.360 --> 25:26.320]  have the report right here for you it's actually hillary clinton that is going to be dropping out
[25:26.320 --> 25:36.000]  of the race uh she is uh due in fact to drop out tomorrow hillary clinton is due to drop out of the
[25:36.000 --> 25:42.000]  race tomorrow and there you see the new york post uh hillary to drop out due to criminal probe and
[25:42.000 --> 25:48.480]  we have a clip that we're going to play uh coming up uh where julian assange has put out a statement
[25:48.480 --> 25:53.680]  saying that when the next information comes out she will be indicted because it's absolute proof
[25:53.680 --> 25:57.360]  of her criminal activity the last wiki leaks of course was them sending out
[25:57.360 --> 26:02.320]  bernie sanders dressed clinton supporters to attack trump supporters so that they could
[26:02.320 --> 26:07.840]  shut down trump make him look violent but also make bernie's people look violent and of course it
[26:07.840 --> 26:12.400]  was roger stohn exposed that back when that first happened about four months ago in chicago
[26:12.400 --> 26:20.560]  so hillary to drop out due to a criminal probe ladies and gentlemen and that dub tells us what
[26:20.560 --> 26:26.800]  julian assange uh said about a week ago and rt reported on that again we're going to play that
[26:26.800 --> 26:33.360]  in a moment uh so there you go it's it's hillary is actually to drop out due to criminal probe
[26:33.360 --> 26:43.040]  uh and also because she has a brain tumor the size of a large watermelon uh also uh hillary
[26:43.040 --> 26:50.560]  is to drop out uh due to the fact uh that uh she was caught uh getting money from the coke brothers
[26:50.560 --> 26:57.120]  150 million to drop out so she's being bought off by the coke brothers for 150 million uh
[26:57.120 --> 27:04.800]  and also her husband bill clinton is an illegal alien uh and also uh she's very racist and also
[27:04.800 --> 27:10.000]  she doesn't like hispanics uh and also she's a russian spy of course in that case it's really true
[27:10.000 --> 27:13.280]  the wall street journal admits she did deals with her foundation that nobody else could
[27:13.280 --> 27:19.760]  for uranium and weapons to russia so that part is not satire and yes folks this is satire it's not
[27:19.760 --> 27:25.280]  satire that julian assange says the next leak will uh get her indicted for sure i'm not sure about
[27:25.280 --> 27:30.800]  that i think hillary uh because the mainstream media is behind her because she does have a
[27:30.800 --> 27:35.920]  small minority of cult followers and by minority i mean a bunch of whacked out crazy people of
[27:35.920 --> 27:42.480]  every race color and creed uh that she basically has hit larry in control over her minions and
[27:42.480 --> 27:47.520]  they'd put up with anything from her but as you watch this and hear this is it is absurd
[27:48.240 --> 27:53.600]  to come out here with fake new york post headlines saying hillary to drop out due to criminal probe
[27:53.600 --> 28:00.640]  so it is absurd to get up here uh on air and say she has a brain tumor the size of a watermelon
[28:00.640 --> 28:07.040]  i'm sure it's much smaller it is absurd uh to set up here with no proof and say that but that's
[28:07.040 --> 28:12.080]  what politico and the new york times everybody else is doing thousands of publications yesterday
[28:12.080 --> 28:18.080]  today saying what do they do if he drops out republicans may replace him uh insiders say
[28:18.080 --> 28:26.240]  his sons are mad at him none of it's true the same lies over and over and over again a bc
[28:26.240 --> 28:33.520]  good morning america is saying and the new york times is saying they're all saying it and there's
[28:33.520 --> 28:41.360]  no truth to it so it goes from he's going to drop out for sure to what happens if he drops out this
[28:41.360 --> 28:47.200]  is how they run scams just like ben carson when they announced when he was on an airplane the night
[28:47.200 --> 28:52.960]  iowa took place oh ben just told us he's dropping out vote for me you know good job ben good showing
[28:53.760 --> 29:00.640]  glad you endorsed me ted cruise remember all that ted cruise campaign spread false report in
[29:00.640 --> 29:05.680]  iowa that ben carson was quitting race this is the same thing but bigger where's the controversy
[29:05.680 --> 29:13.040]  where's the anger that they've put out fake headlines now again i'm doing this satire to
[29:13.040 --> 29:17.280]  show you a fake headline you watch the media is going to be bad saying that i'm evil because
[29:17.280 --> 29:21.680]  i haven't talked about this but all i'm doing is illustrating what they've done and put the
[29:21.680 --> 29:27.200]  shoe on the other foot now we come back i have the news articles and i actually have the roiders
[29:27.200 --> 29:34.800]  polls and others where they'll sample 15 percentage points more for hillary 15 percentage more democrats
[29:35.360 --> 29:40.560]  than they do republicans they sample to show her 10 points ahead this is the most naked fraud
[29:40.560 --> 29:43.920]  we've ever seen why not say hillary is 3 000 points ahead
[29:49.680 --> 29:56.400]  we're on the march the empire's on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[30:01.040 --> 30:06.400]  one of the reasons there is so much anxiety about mrs clinton from the intelligence community
[30:06.400 --> 30:11.520]  is the belief that some of the materials that she handled with such extreme carelessness i'm using
[30:11.520 --> 30:19.520]  jim comey's phrase in my opinion it was criminal but contained the names of american undercover
[30:19.520 --> 30:25.520]  intelligence agents some of whom are no longer with us this is the belief of a lot of people
[30:25.520 --> 30:31.920]  in the intelligence community what difference at this point does it make it is our job to figure
[30:31.920 --> 30:36.640]  out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again just like
[30:36.640 --> 30:41.760]  ben gazi it does make a difference to the people who died to their families even though it makes no
[30:41.760 --> 30:46.720]  difference to her she is right about one thing however the way you prevent the betrayal of
[30:46.720 --> 30:52.400]  americans who put their lives on the line to protect the country is to keep this self-centered
[30:52.400 --> 31:03.680]  warmongering corrupt politician from ever holding office again grandpa wars dot com i'm david night

[32:58.640 --> 33:17.440]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[33:18.320 --> 33:24.640]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[33:24.640 --> 33:32.560]  well back in late june political just came out and said trump was being paid 150 million dollars
[33:32.560 --> 33:37.280]  by the coke brothers to drop out trump came out and said your total liars total fabrication
[33:38.800 --> 33:43.360]  number one that's illegal number two i'd never give up we're winning i read his quotes earlier
[33:44.080 --> 33:48.960]  but they don't care they're back everywhere saying he's going to drop out by the day they
[33:48.960 --> 33:54.720]  went will he drop out because he's so far behind hillary clinton ladies and gentlemen was 10 points
[33:54.720 --> 33:59.440]  behind when roiders and others i'm going to cover this here in a moment and go to our guest
[34:00.160 --> 34:05.600]  started coming out and adding 15 percentage points more of democrats that they knew were
[34:05.600 --> 34:10.960]  registered democrats that they were calling in the phone sample in fact i have a computer shot here
[34:10.960 --> 34:24.000]  of the roiders poll for tv viewers 650 democrats 496 republicans that's that's upwards of 15 percent
[34:24.000 --> 34:30.400]  more of course you're going to see hillary clinton ahead and that's what they're doing all over the
[34:30.400 --> 34:38.960]  place or they in other polls give her the independent votes i mean it is amazing i've never seen
[34:38.960 --> 34:45.200]  more corruption not even in the old soviet union not in communist china this is unprecedented so
[34:45.200 --> 34:52.720]  we've put off the headline new york post hillary to drop out due to criminal probe because julien
[34:52.720 --> 34:57.040]  assange has come out and said the next group of emails to come out i wish he released them right now
[34:58.240 --> 35:02.960]  has her involved in criminal activity directing well we already have enough with the last data
[35:02.960 --> 35:10.480]  dump for that to happen so that's why this is so important let's play that clip julien assange
[35:10.480 --> 35:15.360]  is now preparing to release more leaked emails and this time he says they will quote provide
[35:15.360 --> 35:22.000]  enough evidence to indict hillary clinton assange also made it clear there is no evidence of russian
[35:22.000 --> 35:27.280]  involvement in the email hack despite the clinton campaign's claims for details on this story we
[35:27.280 --> 35:33.040]  go now to laura smith in the uk julien assange the founder of wiki leaks of course is still
[35:33.040 --> 35:38.000]  holed up in the ecuadorian embassy here in london but once again he's proven that he's not just
[35:38.000 --> 35:44.320]  sitting there twiddling his thumbs uh not content with releasing 20 000 emails from the democratic
[35:44.320 --> 35:49.600]  national committee uh assange now says he'll be releasing more material that he says will
[35:49.600 --> 35:55.520]  provide enough evidence to see hillary clinton arrested he's given a series of interviews
[35:55.520 --> 36:00.480]  and that's good and that's what he put out via a text press release obviously a week and a half ago
[36:01.120 --> 36:04.960]  but there's more evidence that she will be stepping down because of a criminal probe
[36:04.960 --> 36:10.880]  than there is that trump would because there's no evidence of that it's totally made up out of whole
[36:10.880 --> 36:16.080]  cloth but i tell you i'm gonna fight fire with fire and i'm giving our audience fair warning
[36:16.080 --> 36:19.120]  that i'm gonna do what they're doing now every time they do it i'm gonna put it out on the
[36:19.120 --> 36:24.240]  mainstream media but then tell the audience as a proviso that i'm giving you an example of what
[36:24.240 --> 36:30.000]  they're doing see these are not dirty tricks on our side we're showing you what the dinosaur media is
[36:30.000 --> 36:35.200]  up to the way they're manipulating i mean look at these roiders articles so then we're going to our
[36:35.200 --> 36:42.400]  guest look at this pat caddell on crooked roiders poll never in my life have i seen a news organization
[36:42.400 --> 36:47.920]  do something so dishonest they're even back dating old polls with the new methodology that no one's
[36:47.920 --> 36:53.520]  ever done of using more democrats than republicans for some reason they're even memory-holding stuff
[36:53.520 --> 36:59.840]  now the old Soviet human would go back into newspapers and micro fish you know out people's
[36:59.840 --> 37:07.600]  photos they'd blur amount of photos roiders radically changes methodology to favor clinton
[37:07.600 --> 37:15.280]  another report on that more polling tricks new roiders poll extremely skewed reality shows
[37:15.280 --> 37:19.280]  trump tied with hillary i even disagree with that he's way ahead of her because most folks are
[37:19.280 --> 37:26.320]  closeted but now they're trying to create the illusion the illusion that trump is behind to
[37:26.320 --> 37:30.640]  create a bandwagon effect so people think they've got to get behind the winner meanwhile there's a
[37:30.640 --> 37:36.080]  video up on info wars dot com with psychiatrists psychologists and others plus the video of hillary
[37:36.080 --> 37:41.760]  obviously out of her mind at a whole bunch of different events and people asking her are you okay
[37:41.760 --> 37:49.680]  okay this is a borderline personality disorder person with a serious capacity for psychotic
[37:49.680 --> 37:54.400]  breaks which before she would have every few days according to the secret service and i don't
[37:54.400 --> 37:59.680]  just mean the ones on the news people i know and not just the fbi but now she's having breaks
[37:59.680 --> 38:07.040]  many times a day and she goes between thinking she's a god and invincible to hating everyone
[38:07.040 --> 38:14.080]  around her classic borderline personality disorder and again borderlines go into these
[38:14.080 --> 38:18.960]  psychotic breaks they're not psychotic all the time but they they have these psychotic moments
[38:19.840 --> 38:23.680]  especially when triggered by stress we're going to give the nuclear launch codes to this person
[38:23.680 --> 38:30.240]  that never built anything or did anything in her life but a a trail of carnage and destruction behind
[38:30.240 --> 38:36.800]  her so we're going to take the last 10 minutes where i came in and said big announcement hillary
[38:36.800 --> 38:43.440]  clinton is stepping down tomorrow due to a criminal probe that is to illustrate how
[38:43.440 --> 38:47.680]  much the mainstream media is lying but in her case we actually have evidence that at least
[38:47.680 --> 38:52.720]  points partly towards her down the road if these wiki leaks documents come out
[38:52.720 --> 38:57.360]  assange hasn't exaggerated he's been pretty conservative so this must be bombshell material
[38:57.360 --> 39:02.160]  what are we going to do then of course we know what the documents are we already have our sources
[39:02.160 --> 39:07.920]  inside the cia and inside defense intelligence and others general flin's gone public as well
[39:07.920 --> 39:12.640]  former head of defense intelligence and that's that hillary the whole time was shipping weapons
[39:12.640 --> 39:17.040]  to al qaeda and then had the name changed to isis and now donald trump has come out we're
[39:17.040 --> 39:21.920]  going to play the clip later and said she's the founder of isis i'm very proud that i'm the
[39:21.920 --> 39:27.280]  coiner of that term three years ago you can google it hillary clinton is the founder of isis
[39:27.280 --> 39:33.280]  trump now not copying us that's the reality roger stone former trump campaign head trump
[39:33.280 --> 39:38.240]  confidant bestselling author author of the clinton's war on women available at info war store
[39:38.240 --> 39:44.160]  dot com and the new bill clinton rape shirt uh you've been in nine different campaigns inside
[39:44.160 --> 39:49.040]  four administrations you're part of the florida recount you're a vote fraud expert uh stone
[39:49.040 --> 39:53.440]  zone dot com you've heard what i've been saying the last five minutes roger stone is there any
[39:53.440 --> 39:59.120]  doubt we are at the most epic moment ever not just in u.s politics but world politics
[39:59.120 --> 40:05.600]  i have never seen something this crazy i have never seen something this over the top i have
[40:05.600 --> 40:13.360]  never seen mainstream media go this wild and and crazed is this a sign of strength or a sign of
[40:13.360 --> 40:19.280]  desperation well oxford soul is great to be back with you i flew in from los angeles last night
[40:19.280 --> 40:24.480]  got into miami about five a m therefore i haven't seen a lot of the press and then this morning when
[40:24.480 --> 40:31.680]  i went online to prepare for the show it boggles the mind i've never uh in almost 40 years in
[40:31.680 --> 40:38.640]  american politics seen anything like this i mean the tactics that were used against barry goldwater
[40:38.640 --> 40:44.160]  you know a thousand psychiatrists say goldwater unfit to be president in this headline nothing
[40:44.160 --> 40:52.000]  compared to this um i spoke to uh don trump uh yesterday he's in good spirits he has no
[40:52.000 --> 40:56.800]  intention whatsoever of dropping out you can say anything you want about trump he's not a quitter
[40:56.800 --> 41:04.000]  he's a brawler he's a fighter uh and this is 100 percent disinformation is it coincidental
[41:04.000 --> 41:11.040]  that abc who is seems to be taking the lead in reporting this falsehood is the home of clinton
[41:11.040 --> 41:17.200]  foundation donor george stephanopoulos uh these guys should be filing at the federal election
[41:17.200 --> 41:23.280]  commission as a as an in-kind contribution to the clinton campaign um uh in all my years in
[41:23.280 --> 41:29.600]  politics i've never seen anything more egregious or more outrageous it's an attempt to despair at
[41:29.600 --> 41:37.200]  trump's supporters uh and uh it follows on the heels of a number of false reports let's go through
[41:37.200 --> 41:45.600]  them there's a staff mutiny at hand at the trump campaign 100 percent false uh the there's going to
[41:45.600 --> 41:54.000]  be an intervention by trump's senior staff this weekend 100 percent false uh campaign manager
[41:54.000 --> 42:03.360]  paul minifort has given up he's now phoning it in 100 percent false minifort uh you know is of
[42:03.360 --> 42:11.440]  sicilian extraction he never quit he's a fighter like trump so um this is a this is a smear writ
[42:11.440 --> 42:17.920]  large alex and it is meant to uh it is meant to uh particularly have a stifling effect on
[42:17.920 --> 42:23.600]  trump's fundraising which i'm sure that is happening uh and do so confusion within the
[42:23.600 --> 42:29.360]  ranks of trump supporters but to those folks who are listening or watching down from not
[42:29.360 --> 42:34.000]  dropping out of this race and let's be clear manifort is your business partner of 30 something
[42:34.000 --> 42:38.080]  years we we we should probably get manifort on here immediately or get him on other channels
[42:38.080 --> 42:42.400]  but but i'm sure he's been trying i'm not seeing you know anywhere on the news
[42:42.400 --> 42:46.560]  trump denying it other in his tweets and his statements it looks like they're not even letting
[42:46.560 --> 42:52.800]  him get on air to say this is a lie well i i think they're formulating a strategy so i would i would
[42:52.800 --> 42:58.480]  sit tight uh knowing trump i know he is not happy about this smear but that's all it is it it's
[42:58.480 --> 43:04.240]  this information this is something worthy of the soviets look we know for example
[43:05.120 --> 43:12.960]  that the dnc wiki leaks absolutely positively did not come from the russians we know that
[43:12.960 --> 43:18.960]  because crucifer two took credit for them a good two weeks ago and and and initially
[43:18.960 --> 43:25.360]  released them they got almost no attention he then went to wiki leaks they re-release them
[43:25.360 --> 43:30.720]  and of course they screwed up the entire first two days of the democratic national convention
[43:30.720 --> 43:36.560]  when it became clear that debbie waserman schultz had helped yield the nomination from bernie
[43:36.560 --> 43:44.720]  sanders for hillary so the the clinton campaign narrative the russians favor donald trump and
[43:44.720 --> 43:51.280]  the russians are leaking this information this is an oculation because as you said earlier
[43:51.280 --> 43:58.400]  they know what is coming and it is devastating let's remember that their defense in all of the
[43:58.400 --> 44:06.000]  clinton foundation scandals has been not we didn't do it has been you have no proof yes but you have
[44:06.000 --> 44:11.440]  no proof well i think julie anassange has that proof and i think he's going to furnish it to the
[44:11.440 --> 44:18.000]  american people let's point out that assange is a real liberal uh somebody that stands up for
[44:18.000 --> 44:23.840]  people's rights for open societies and i'm really proud the fact that a lot of real liberals around
[44:23.840 --> 44:28.320]  the world are battling hillary and pointing out how evil she is but it's because they've got the
[44:28.320 --> 44:32.960]  hacked emails there's no doubt that trump's been hacked there's no doubt people have dug into trump
[44:32.960 --> 44:36.480]  you know i've had big hacker groups i know get into some of our stuff before and they went wow we
[44:36.480 --> 44:41.680]  like you we now know you're for real that's how they check people out and the truth is is that
[44:41.680 --> 44:45.600]  assange and all the groups that are feeding him and the intel we've got from william benney and
[44:45.600 --> 44:50.560]  others now is that it's not mainly russia russia's been involved some in climate gating things
[44:50.560 --> 44:55.280]  exposing that fraud that it's people in u.s intelligence that are actually leaking this wiki
[44:55.280 --> 45:01.200]  leaks well and say what you like about assange is a true progressive he's really a liberal hillary's
[45:01.200 --> 45:07.040]  not a liberal she's a crony capitalist she's about the money this is a criminal enterprise not an
[45:07.040 --> 45:13.120]  ideological enterprise this is the point that bernie sanders was trying not very well to make
[45:13.120 --> 45:18.240]  uh i have a major piece coming on hillary's relationship with the big banks and why she
[45:18.240 --> 45:23.520]  is sold out to the big banks on both coast essentially doing their bidding and destroying
[45:23.520 --> 45:27.520]  the small community banks that most of us go to sure just to be clear roger stone
[45:29.760 --> 45:33.440]  you're saying obviously this is all fake trump said that over and over again when they tried to
[45:33.440 --> 45:39.440]  beta test this a month ago or a month and a half ago back in june but clearly this is the the panic
[45:39.440 --> 45:44.160]  we see is that they know more wiki leaks is coming out they know stuff's coming out about
[45:44.160 --> 45:50.000]  how ill hillary is and things like that yeah so they have to try to disqualify from now through
[45:50.000 --> 45:56.480]  these smear tactics i think that is precisely the strategy and then i see reports today that republican
[45:56.480 --> 46:03.520]  national chairman rince previs called trump and lit into him let me tell you how unlikely that is
[46:03.520 --> 46:09.040]  first of all rince previs is a historical figure he's the only republican national
[46:09.040 --> 46:15.040]  chairman in the history of the party since 1860 who has lost the presidential election and been
[46:15.040 --> 46:22.000]  kept on in that job generally speaking losers are encouraged to move on uh and perhaps trump
[46:22.000 --> 46:27.040]  should have named a a chair who is more law absolutely clearly he's there to throw elections
[46:27.040 --> 46:31.600]  the fix is in the republican establishments working with hillary all lined up denouncing
[46:31.600 --> 46:38.000]  trump this is the greatest endorsement of trump ever to any true populist well and is there any
[46:38.000 --> 46:45.040]  voter anywhere who cares about whether paul ryan has endorsed down trump or vice versa i mean paul ryan
[46:45.040 --> 46:51.200]  is an open borders man he's a tpp man i am proud of the fact that trump hasn't endorsed that tpp
[46:51.200 --> 46:56.080]  guy that stabbed him in the back yeah i totally agree this again though the media continues to
[46:56.080 --> 47:01.360]  say well how will how will trump possibly win without the support of the bushes and the romney's
[47:01.360 --> 47:07.280]  and the ryan the answer is uh easily because those people are discredited a bunch of discredited
[47:07.280 --> 47:13.920]  globalist rhino neocon losers thank god the bushes and and everybody else are against them now
[47:13.920 --> 47:19.520]  expanding on that i want to just read the quote from trump in june when politico in the new york
[47:19.520 --> 47:25.280]  times trial ballooned that he was being paid off to quit which is asinine he's lost hundreds of
[47:25.280 --> 47:30.400]  millions in boycotts alone why would he quit for 150 million this story this is donald trump is a
[47:30.400 --> 47:35.200]  total fabrication from you and politico as usual the new york billionaire said in an email sent
[47:35.200 --> 47:40.800]  by his campaign manager i will never leave the race nobody has had enough money to pay me to
[47:40.800 --> 47:45.040]  leave the race and if they did it would be totally illegal anyways did obama and the clinton's get
[47:45.040 --> 47:51.200]  you to write this now this was said a few weeks before the emails came out that politico directly
[47:51.200 --> 47:58.320]  is getting talking points just like abc news and just like the new york times so so i mean trump
[47:58.320 --> 48:05.120]  is shown to be prescient here roger yeah this is uh this is part and parcel of the mainstream media's
[48:05.120 --> 48:10.000]  bag of tricks and of course i think it was winston churchell who says you know the rumors halfway
[48:10.000 --> 48:15.040]  across the room before the truth has a chance to put its pants on that's right uh this is precisely
[48:15.040 --> 48:20.000]  what's happening here and it's runaway it has become you know ubiquitous go on twitter you go on
[48:20.000 --> 48:25.680]  facebook you have all these people parroting the mainstream media regarding the fact that trump
[48:25.680 --> 48:32.400]  is on the verge of dropping out which just to be clear absolutely positively is not anyone who knows
[48:32.400 --> 48:38.240]  trump knows that this will only spur him on to greater effort that this will only make him hunker
[48:38.240 --> 48:46.720]  down and fight harder harder uh you're right we did we did face this exact same messaging from the
[48:46.720 --> 48:53.680]  media and the left during the nomination phase i am beginning uh alex as i know you are to turn
[48:53.680 --> 49:00.560]  my attention to what i think is the real danger here once this particular thing is tamped down and
[49:00.560 --> 49:08.000]  that is uh the very real possibility of election fraud the very real possibility that this election
[49:08.000 --> 49:13.280]  will be stolen from donald trump and we're going to pause in a moment and talk about that that look
[49:13.280 --> 49:18.800]  look it's not you advising trump reading myself though i know we both told him this and he concurs
[49:18.800 --> 49:23.120]  that obviously if they try to steal the nomination they're fixing everything they won't list you on
[49:23.120 --> 49:27.520]  google as a presidential candidate they're censoring you everywhere they're lying about you
[49:27.520 --> 49:32.160]  they're going to try to steal it do what you did in the primaries point out the fraud so that
[49:32.160 --> 49:37.760]  politically we have the will as a public to say no and and they may back off or we're going to
[49:37.760 --> 49:41.440]  challenge it well obviously that's what trump's doing not because he listens to us but because
[49:41.440 --> 49:46.000]  it's the truth and common sense and that has panicked the white house and as you know hundreds
[49:46.000 --> 49:51.600]  of publications that know that you and i the you know the day before he went public last sunday
[49:52.240 --> 49:57.120]  challenge trump to do exactly this and it's not that they're scared that we're advising trump
[49:57.120 --> 50:02.080]  it's that they're scared that he is such a real patriot and has never compromised and is threatening
[50:02.080 --> 50:07.840]  to overturn their entire system yeah i think that's exactly right this this is a topic we have to get
[50:07.840 --> 50:14.160]  into at some length i'm going to break here for just a moment and come back and and and get into
[50:14.160 --> 50:18.240]  and and get into that if you can do five minutes the next hour we'd love to have you and if you
[50:18.240 --> 50:24.080]  can do a full hour tomorrow or do a special report this is such a key time roger stone is our guest
[50:24.080 --> 50:30.960]  but before i break for a moment i just want everybody to understand something i cannot hype
[50:30.960 --> 50:36.240]  enough to you the situation we're in there are not words how over the top how epic how insane
[50:36.240 --> 50:40.720]  all this is and i'm going to ask roger as we get into election fraud i'll just voter fraud but
[50:40.720 --> 50:47.120]  institutional black box fraud i want to ask him is this jumping the shark my gut tells me
[50:47.120 --> 50:51.520]  my gut's never wrong that if people grab their destiny in their hands the fact that the whole
[50:51.520 --> 50:56.560]  system is panicking against trump and and and escalating the lies to cartoon level that this
[50:56.560 --> 51:01.280]  is going to backfire with people especially because we have a few months and that this is only going
[51:01.280 --> 51:06.160]  to embolden the public to support him in a landslide i think this panic by the establishment
[51:06.160 --> 51:11.760]  is the most illustrative point that their time has come the third time is over in the history
[51:11.760 --> 51:15.680]  of this republic we're going back to roger stone of stonezone.com in a moment but first
[51:17.520 --> 51:22.720]  the clinton rape shirt is super aggressive but the globalists are aggressive everyone needs to
[51:22.720 --> 51:28.240]  get the clinton rape shirt at infowarstore.com and you need free shipping by the way this week

[51:33.600 --> 51:40.000]  archetypal obama hope style get out there get aggressive we're going to lose everything if
[51:40.000 --> 51:44.080]  we don't they're trying to bully us into submission get the hillary for prison shirt that has
[51:44.960 --> 51:51.120]  been in thousands of publications that has has absolutely forced that onto the the the floor

[52:01.680 --> 52:09.520]  now this is destiny i'm not on the bad guy team folks you wild horses to quote the rolling stones
[52:09.520 --> 52:14.160]  couldn't drag me away from this this is epic battle for the republic it's happening now
[52:14.160 --> 52:17.520]  everybody shoots their mouths off and says hey who's going to get in the arena for us
[52:17.520 --> 52:22.640]  who's going to fight the new old order trump's doing it pure americana a hundred percent

[52:30.240 --> 52:35.600]  lie heaped on him every demonization heaped on him it's almost christlike i'm not comparing him to
[52:35.600 --> 52:40.320]  christ but i mean the sins of the world heaped on his back blame for everything target of the whole
[52:40.320 --> 52:45.360]  world his family rug to the mud and trumps up there like a bulldozer running right through him

[53:59.280 --> 54:04.800]  whatever you do we're the tip of the spear we're taking action we're exposing the hoax that they're
[54:04.800 --> 54:09.840]  saying trump is going to drop out or will he drop out that's like saying hillary to drop out
[54:09.840 --> 54:15.680]  and creating a fake new york post headline that is illustrative of the level of their deception
[54:15.680 --> 54:20.560]  roger stone going back to you my friend i talk about election fraud talk about
[54:20.560 --> 54:24.880]  what we're facing uh and the fact that trump is calling him on it and saying he's going to challenge
[54:24.880 --> 54:32.080]  it yeah this is of course unheard of in in in political circles there seems to be some naive
[54:32.080 --> 54:40.160]  notion that computerized voting cannot be rigged is never rigged i was actually on a program uh
[54:40.160 --> 54:46.480]  it in cleveland with the huffington post with my longtime friend uh howard feinman who i agree on
[54:46.480 --> 54:52.640]  with almost nothing uh and a woman from a huffington post actually said as a flat statement there's
[54:52.640 --> 54:59.280]  no evidence whatsoever that election fraud exists what planet do these people live on these are
[54:59.280 --> 55:06.640]  computers uh we have both seen a powerful video about how the so-called die-bold machines can be
[55:06.640 --> 55:12.960]  rigged um one of the reasons i went to california is because those machines are in common use there
[55:12.960 --> 55:18.640]  they are under control of the state secretary of state who actually holds a position in the
[55:18.640 --> 55:25.040]  hillary clinton campaign now you remember during the 2000 recount people went out of their mind
[55:25.040 --> 55:31.040]  because catherine harris who was the secretary of state in florida um had endorsed and campaigned
[55:31.040 --> 55:36.880]  and had a position in the bush campaign so in other words it's okay for the clinton's but it's not
[55:36.880 --> 55:44.800]  okay for republic extraordinary uh we're going to be laying out a very specific plan uh in the
[55:44.800 --> 55:51.520]  next couple weeks to combat what i believe will be an egregious and outrageous effort to steal
[55:51.520 --> 55:58.480]  the next election uh if the polls show as i think they will that trump is in a dogfight for the
[55:58.480 --> 56:03.760]  presidency of the united states by the way we have former chief die-bold engineers and others
[56:03.760 --> 56:10.000]  that have testified to state and federal legislatures that they engage in fraud were ordered to engage
[56:10.000 --> 56:14.480]  in fraud and that major elections have been stolen so to have this clinton lackey say it doesn't
[56:14.480 --> 56:21.120]  exist uh this is just madness well and let me say it's existed and been done by both parties
[56:21.120 --> 56:26.800]  but look i have a long sentimental attachment to the republican party i'm a former young republican
[56:26.800 --> 56:32.560]  national chairman i have worked for a nine republican presidential candidates actually
[56:32.560 --> 56:38.240]  eight because i proudly supported gary johnson against met romney and helped the governor
[56:38.240 --> 56:44.240]  johnson get on the ballot in 48 states but uh it has happened at the hands of both parties
[56:44.240 --> 56:51.680]  you'll recall the famous incident in which carl rove melted down on fox the night of the 2012
[56:51.680 --> 56:56.640]  election when he kept insisting that the results shown on the screen couldn't possibly be right
[56:56.640 --> 57:02.800]  because ohio was going for romney why was he so sure why was he so positive he was right
[57:03.440 --> 57:10.320]  unless of course he thought the fix was in which is exactly what he thought so uh it is uh it is
[57:10.320 --> 57:15.600]  a topic for broader discussion but more importantly we're going to lay out in the next couple weeks
[57:15.600 --> 57:23.760]  a very specific detailed plan on what the average citizen can do to fight voter fraud and i've also
[57:23.760 --> 57:29.040]  noticed that uh hillary sheet of staff said this is quote dangerous what trump's doing
[57:29.040 --> 57:33.120]  pointing out fraud they're really scared of us ahead of time pointing out she's crooked because
[57:33.120 --> 57:38.080]  everybody knows she's crooked she's fixed everything the primaries everything it makes perfect sense
[57:38.080 --> 57:42.480]  for trump to come out and say that so they're they're really scared of us i i think the fact
[57:42.480 --> 57:46.880]  that trump came out this week and said i'm gonna fight election fraud i think that helps send them
[57:46.880 --> 57:52.240]  into this panic well you have to let them know uh in advance that you're not going to stand for it
[57:52.240 --> 57:57.760]  that if there's any solid evidence of election irregularity you're prepared to challenge her
[57:57.760 --> 58:04.400]  swearing in and create a constitutional crisis now in 1960 we had the closest election in
[58:04.400 --> 58:10.480]  american history there was ample evidence that richard nixon had been robbed but the truth is
[58:10.480 --> 58:15.440]  the largest reason he didn't challenge those results is because they were irreversible the
[58:15.440 --> 58:22.480]  reason they were irreversible was because the balance in the state of texas had already been burned
[58:22.480 --> 58:29.440]  oh nothing to recount linden johnson destroyed the evidence um texas was stolen from the next
[58:29.440 --> 58:34.960]  and lodge ticket today however you have at least on some of these machines hold on do five more

[01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:45.600]  it up on the satellite uh i'm going into a seven day a week system right now is clinton eastwood
[01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:50.480]  aduce x coming in for trump and saying you know the political correctness hate scene we got to be
[01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:56.320]  with trump how exciting is that and then separately um we've done research on the con guy our stories
[01:00:56.320 --> 01:01:06.800]  on drudgereport.com today this con guy founded a super hardcore muslim brotherhood law association
[01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:11.920]  to promote syria law in the west that and and the writing specifically called for the
[01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:18.320]  execution of gays uh exclusive uh kazir con founded islamic journal defense free of law
[01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:24.480]  con defense syria law responsible for executions of gays women in 11 countries i mean wow and
[01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:29.360]  then he's hooked him with a clinton's what is going on here roger yeah this is what they call a con
[01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:36.480]  job if i may uh the real irony of course is that he he chastises trump at the convention asking
[01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:42.560]  if he's ever read the constitution on the other hand mr con is an advocate for syria law and has
[01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:48.960]  specifically written in numerous places that syria would take precedence over the u.s constitution
[01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:55.120]  now alex i don't need to tell you the difference under syria women and gays and christians and
[01:01:55.120 --> 01:02:01.520]  others are oppressed brutalized and killed whereas the u.s constitution protects all those people
[01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:09.760]  so uh his his the fundamental basis of attack on trump is phony go a next step which is trumps
[01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:17.280]  proposed ban uh for a temporary ban on muslim immigration is not unconstitutional it's perfectly
[01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:24.560]  legal the president has that authority block any group for any period of time and i say arrest
[01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:29.760]  obama for not checking the passports don't have constitutional rights exactly they're not u.s citizens
[01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:36.480]  so the whole thing is a canard and more and more is being learned about mr con every day like i said
[01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:41.200]  it's a con job how do we in the last two minutes we have with you two and a half minutes how do we
[01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:45.920]  strike back obviously we're not losing they're being forced to lie go thermo nuclear that's
[01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:51.440]  going to backfire but it makes me wonder i mean you say trumps got big wave os i agree he is in
[01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:56.320]  danger we should be praying for donald trump uh but but how do we counter just weaponized lies
[01:02:57.760 --> 01:03:02.720]  yeah look i think the best way of course is to keep repeating the truth but just watch trump he
[01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:07.600]  will handle this with a plume i think they're handing him an opportunity because they are so
[01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:13.440]  over the top they're so overextended this is so outrageous that i think there's going to be a
[01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:19.200]  backlash of sympathy for him just i would uh i would key off what trump says watch his tweets
[01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:25.840]  watch his appearances he was very effective in daytona yesterday uh it's so outrageous to me
[01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:32.800]  we can now learn that hillary gave a patchy helicopter to the isis but we're busy talking
[01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:39.520]  about whether trump is going to drop out which he's not that's right and boy wait till the new
[01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:43.760]  wikileaks comes out as signs like you said earlier he doesn't usually he doesn't exaggerate this must
[01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:50.160]  be devastating and the word is it is confirmed her ordering weapons al-qaeda yeah look i think
[01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:58.080]  he's got a a treasure trove of of documents and i expect that he will drop them at strategic times
[01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:06.640]  the day before a debate for example uh therefore i that's their greatest single danger but at the
[01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:13.360]  same time trump has to be poised to exploit each one of those opening he has to be poised to make
[01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:19.360]  sure that the mainstream media doesn't mute those things the way they have muted all the bad news
[01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:23.920]  and every single listener is so key in the fight sharing articles sharing links
[01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:28.240]  sharing the grassroots response we're bigger than the mainstream media when the listeners
[01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:32.880]  decide to move but they've got to understand they're the power and trump is bigger than the
[01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:38.080]  republican party this idea that the republican national committee is preparing for a plan for
[01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:44.880]  when trump drops out complete and total be asked uh trump's not going anywhere other than the white
[01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:48.960]  house that's right oh roger i'll talk to you tonight if you can talk thank you so much get
[01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:54.400]  some rest and hopefully get you back tomorrow thank you sir wow rogerstonestonezone.com get the
[01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:58.560]  clinton rape shirt at info or store help fund this operation and spread the truth we'll be back
[01:04:58.560 --> 01:05:04.720]  with another patreon one of the reasons there is so much anxiety about mrs clinton from the
[01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:10.320]  intelligence community is the belief that some of the materials that she handled with such extreme
[01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:16.400]  carelessness i'm using jim comey's phrase in my opinion it was criminal but contained the names
[01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:24.320]  of american undercover intelligence agents some of whom are no longer with us this is the belief
[01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:30.320]  of a lot of people in the intelligence community what difference at this point does it make it is
[01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:35.120]  our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever
[01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:40.240]  happening again just like ben ghazi it does make a difference to the people who died to their families
[01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:45.680]  even though it makes no difference to her she is right about one thing however the way you prevent
[01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:51.440]  the betrayal of americans who put their lives on the line to protect the country is to keep this
[01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:58.720]  self-centered warmongering corrupt politician from ever holding office again grandpa wars.com

[01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:41.440]  a few years ago that i came out and pointed out that hillary clinton is the founder of ices that's
[01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:46.800]  just the new modern name of al-qaeda our own military came out within a week of vengazi
[01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:52.720]  colonel schaefer and others on the show cia whistleblowers like atosh plumley and said that
[01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:58.240]  hillary was shipping weapons directly to al-qaeda then the public got upset about the military got
[01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:06.560]  upset so they changed the name to isis same flag same group al-qaeda's state is islamic state okay
[01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:10.960]  that's their country but it's all run by saudi arabia and we can actually put on screen some of
[01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:16.000]  the youtube videos and articles that we wrote and that we shot with the headline hillary clinton is
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:23.680]  the founder of isis founder of isis hillary clinton lectures america on terrorism and you can scroll
[01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:29.600]  down that's one of our little sub channels and you can see that's uh april 5th 2016 but you can go
[01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:34.800]  back several years and find the clips i'm not bragging it's just great to see donald trump
[01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:39.920]  really understanding what we're dealing with we've now seen juliani pick up that nomenclature
[01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:46.880]  at the rnc and here's donald trump yesterday talking about how hillary rotham clinton is the
[01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:55.920]  founder of isis look at san bernadino take a look at the world trade center take a look at what's
[01:09:55.920 --> 01:10:03.840]  going on and then worldwide and we let isis take this position it was hillary clinton
[01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:09.440]  that she should get an award from them as the founder of isis that's what it was
[01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:18.560]  that's what it was her weakness her weak policies i've been waiting for this a long time
[01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:26.640]  i love trump nobody's got those wavos all right continuing show that's why they're now running
[01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:32.800]  around saying they they tried this in june they said oh he's got 150 million from the
[01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:38.000]  coke brothers to drop out he's lost hundreds of millions in tv contracts and stuff just by being
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:43.920]  boycott he's like that's crazy i'm all in i'm never quitting little bird told me that trump will
[01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:48.160]  spend a billion bucks of his own money in the last month the campaign of named b he's raised 80
[01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:54.400]  something million the last month he is dominating and they got roiders out doing 15 higher numbers
[01:10:54.400 --> 01:11:00.560]  of democrats they pull than republicans to say she's 10 points ahead they admit it total fraud
[01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:07.200]  and i've been all over the country my crew's been all over the country whether it's philadelphia or
[01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:13.520]  cleveland or whether it's los angeles or whether it's miami or whether it's dalis or whether it's
[01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:20.400]  chicago i mean i you see our crew every week just all over the country leon macadoo in three days
[01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:26.480]  in la couldn't find people on the street that supported hillary now granted like 80 or so
[01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:32.160]  supported sanders the rest were trump she went to exit polls finally found some eight out we have
[01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:38.800]  the video eight out of ten were for sanders but we don't need to know they stole it they admit
[01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:44.240]  the day before the super delegates met at a quote rich person's house with the ap who runs
[01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:48.400]  the election announcements and they decided what numbers to put on the news the next night
[01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:56.480]  over martinis that was in the new york daily news we have entered the twilight zone here
[01:11:56.480 --> 01:12:02.000]  and now they come out and say trump is is is going to give up trump is going to stand down trump is
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:06.800]  giving up the campaign trump puts out tweets and statements that he hasn't about to give a speech
[01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:12.720]  the media doesn't cover it and they have stefanophilus a clinton operative on abc saying it's
[01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:17.760]  going to happen that's why i ran images earlier in the last hour saying hillary's gonna resign
[01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:22.880]  tomorrow now i said it's satire but imagine if i really put this out and said i had sources
[01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:31.040]  i would be drummed out and i should be of the media but not not the establishment media joining
[01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:36.880]  us is somebody who's a lot has a lot of courage as well james o keith there's video that we posted
[01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:42.800]  last week as our reporters caught it on tape uh burning mob attacks hillary fans he was dressed
[01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:49.040]  up like a hillary supporter they attacked him oh keith strikes again project veratoff exposes
[01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:54.000]  this unity of dnc i'm going to get to that in a moment with james o keith of project veratoff
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:13:00.720]  dot com but i want to get his take on the number one news story isn't hillary and apache helicopters
[01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:05.600]  al qaeda or isis uh it's not the fact that she looks like she's having mental meltdowns every day
[01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:11.520]  now it's not any of this james it's not the latest islamic attack uh that they're saying isn't
[01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:18.560]  islamic attack in london uh or the priest saying you know uh you basically get behind me satan
[01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:22.720]  before he's killed and they attempt to cover that up with them changing the name i'll lead a david
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:30.880]  no it's all that trump's quitting when none of it's true none of it's even true it seems like
[01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:36.560]  we're watching the mainstream media finally die in front of us i think this signals desperation
[01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:46.320]  now you're a smart savvy guy to do disagree with me we lost james's audio james hold on we're not
[01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:50.880]  getting your audio through i'm sorry we've changed yeah well let's start over go ahead james okay
[01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:56.800]  thanks for about that i think it's all manufactured i think everything on television these days
[01:13:56.800 --> 01:14:03.120]  is is is manufactured and after alex i was at the dnc with some of your crew last week in
[01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:09.120]  philadelphia and i saw things that nobody else saw i saw thousands and thousands of people
[01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:14.320]  angry it was like the world war z movie with brad pit they were climbing the they were climbing
[01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:19.440]  over each other to try to get over the fence the perimeter fence that they created so i i've
[01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:26.080]  turned on fox msnbc cnn and i didn't see that i saw a gobbledygook speeches inside the convention
[01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:31.760]  they told us there was total unity just loving no there was no there was no unity and we don't
[01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:37.040]  see those images on television so everyone you see everything you see they're paid consultants
[01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:42.080]  paid to give their positions you're not seeing the reality and frankly the media is obviously
[01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:49.440]  trying to create this narrative against trump we knew that they would do that but but on the ground
[01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:56.000]  well i talked to black protesters i talked to bernie people who are more angry and more hateful
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:01.680]  towards hillary clinton than any republican or trump supporter i know i was thrown to the ground
[01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:07.040]  as you're looking now one of these guys attacked me started screaming hillary stole the election is
[01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:12.240]  what he said and and many people were angry at me i was dressed up like a hillary supporter you have
[01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:18.080]  a lot of courage buddy they were so angry at more angry than any republican i've ever talked to
[01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:24.400]  i can't find hillary supporters unless i go to the richest areas of austin hillary really looks
[01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:30.160]  like she's degenerating what do you think's really going on here i think that the media is trying to
[01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:38.880]  do their best to elect hillary and create these these large narratives that uh that trump is in
[01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:43.680]  trouble and so forth and so on i do think people ask me who do you think someone i think it's a 50-50
[01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:48.640]  chance because the clinton's are are sort of diabolical and i have evidence of voter fraud
[01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:53.760]  but but i think that people are around the country are really upset and and the most
[01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:58.640]  horrible thing we exposed in philadelphia i don't know if you have this flip handy we're we're african
[01:15:58.640 --> 01:16:04.160]  american protesters screaming screaming at the top of their lungs the democrats have done nothing to
[01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:08.640]  help them in the inner cities that the the guy the actual quote was have you seen the poverty
[01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:14.320]  in philadelphia have you seen the homelessness that's why we want to leave the democratic party so
[01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:18.800]  i said undercover and my colleague said there he is right there i don't know if you have the sound
[01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:24.560]  from that but um we said we said to him what what about the fact the first female president breaking
[01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:28.880]  the glass ceiling he says to hell with the glass ceiling i'm trying to put food in the refrigerator
[01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:34.720]  this is a very powerful uh clip and so people are angry you don't see that on television i don't
[01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:40.000]  know why you don't see it but the corporate media won't report that but we will we're we're
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:43.840]  keeping that clip up right now but these are some of the viral videos that info was shot with project
[01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:49.200]  veritas and there's so many others where you do expose elections for all of it i'm really heartened
[01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:52.960]  because the they're being forced out in the open they're being forced to steal primaries
[01:16:52.960 --> 01:16:56.080]  they're being forced to try to steal the general election they're lying and saying
[01:16:56.080 --> 01:17:00.880]  trumps dropped out when he hasn't i mean they're engaged really in panic mode i think so i think
[01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:06.480]  down the road time is running out for these people i'm very confident yeah the whole the whole
[01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:10.720]  media narrative you're seeing on television where they're they're creating narratives that he's in
[01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:16.960]  trouble he's gonna drop out and so it's all just it's all crap peddled by the political consulting
[01:17:16.960 --> 01:17:22.480]  marketing industry and paid consultants it doesn't mean anything and most people i found
[01:17:22.480 --> 01:17:26.880]  alex i don't know if your reporters have found the same thing in the country people are so angry
[01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:31.120]  at the system they don't even believe it anymore that's what i'm saying and i think them getting
[01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:37.440]  even more arrogant and more deceptive is going to backfire because look people know she stole
[01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:41.600]  this from bernie and they know they're trying to steal it now and trump is saying that and they
[01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:46.880]  seem to be in total panic mode uh let's play the clip that mr veritas was talking about here it is
[01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:53.680]  you want to break the glass ceiling what the hell is the glass
[01:17:54.240 --> 01:17:59.200]  i'm trying to put food in refrigeration tell me three reasons she's a woman my mom is a woman
[01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:03.840]  my daughter's a woman give me three reasons why i should vote for him first female president
[01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:08.640]  who gives a damn about the first female president how about the food we want to make history history
[01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:14.240]  we make the history right now every day every day we're making history i just don't understand why
[01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:18.880]  you don't there you go i don't care about a glass ceiling i care about food what about the woman in
[01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:26.160]  my life that's right and alex i mean the power of that clip if that was said by a republican or
[01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:31.120]  someone protesting a republican that'd be played on every single television station over and over
[01:18:31.120 --> 01:18:35.440]  and over again to create a narrative and one thing andrew bright part taught me is it's all about
[01:18:35.440 --> 01:18:39.600]  the media it's all about the narratives and that flies in the face of every single narrative that's
[01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:45.200]  out there he said that same man who's actually a part of the bernie movement he said that young
[01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:51.280]  black men are leading the democratic party and hillary depends on those folks to win and he said
[01:18:51.280 --> 01:18:57.360]  we will never vote for her and if there was any justice in the media they'd be playing footage
[01:18:57.360 --> 01:19:01.280]  like that and they'd have a narrative on the front page of the new york times that is hillary
[01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:08.000]  losing black supporters so you guys were with us in philadelphia your camera man was next to me
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:14.800]  as i was thrown to the ground filming it so they're not going to to report this but alex that
[01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:21.520]  clip was viewed a million times on facebook millions of views on youtube so we're doing our job to get
[01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:26.560]  the message absolutely seeing an average show has 200 000 viewers msnbc a couple hundred thousand
[01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:31.840]  so they can have big fancy 50 million dollar sets it doesn't matter because we actually have the
[01:19:31.840 --> 01:19:36.720]  audience so we've reached that paradox moment where they're lying they're doubling down they're
[01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:42.880]  totally going soviet style and beyond but but the soviets could get away with it for a while
[01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:48.480]  because there was no counterbalance don't they understand there's a major counterbalance james
[01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:52.960]  okayh yeah they understand it which is why that they're they're throwing everything on television
[01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:57.120]  constantly over and over again trump's in trouble trump's in trouble trump's in trouble because they
[01:19:57.120 --> 01:20:03.040]  have to create this this corporate echo chamber on all the big tv stations to counteract the
[01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:08.880]  popular popularity of the grassroots so you're literally seeing right now things the powers
[01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:13.440]  dynamics are shifting i wrote about this when the shootings happened and people were filming it
[01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:19.520]  the power dynamics are changing and it's making them very upset and and if there's one thing i
[01:20:19.520 --> 01:20:26.080]  learned from from being in philadelphia at the dnc is the sheer shock of seeing the thousands of
[01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:32.000]  protesters piled like zombies trying to get over the fence and looking at the tv's you know tv screens
[01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:37.280]  inside of those lobbies in the hotels thinking that's not what i'm seeing outside so there's
[01:20:37.280 --> 01:20:41.600]  there's a power shift happening i don't like i've been around long enough for seven years doing this
[01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:46.800]  to know that everything i see on tv i mean it's it's all just gobbledygook identity politics crap
[01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:52.640]  and we have to get the images in front of people make them trend on social media or on your website
[01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:56.720]  that's the only way that we're gonna that we're gonna because exactly and it's not like we're
[01:20:56.720 --> 01:21:03.120]  sherry picking uh quote minorities for trump or minorities against hillary that's all we see at
[01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:08.000]  rallies i have or events that's all we see and then we tune in seeing in it's like a whole
[01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:12.400]  another planet where they've got 20 reporters out cherry picking to you know put together this
[01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:18.640]  lie but what do they do when almost everyone i talked to quite frankly i think sanders was
[01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:22.400]  as popular as trump and which is you know i mean wrong message but he was right about some of the
[01:21:22.400 --> 01:21:27.040]  problems a lot better than hillary but so so i mean but sanders is popular trump's popular
[01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:32.000]  i'm not finding the hillary people like i said i mean i don't know what her real numbers are
[01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:38.080]  but no wonder reuters has to oversample democrats in polls and i mean because they're trying to
[01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:43.440]  prop the facade up it's so incredible in fact when we walked through the protest uh the video you
[01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:48.640]  played uh a week ago that this was a california hillary delegates saying we need to ban all guns
[01:21:48.640 --> 01:21:53.120]  but call it common sense gun legislation this is a direct quote she said if you just say
[01:21:53.840 --> 01:22:00.080]  sh it like that people will buy into it that is what mary bayer said so i walked through the
[01:22:00.080 --> 01:22:05.840]  burning crowd alex with that little video you're watching a placard of her face in our quote i got
[01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:10.080]  high fives from the from the burning people which shows they're watching your show they're
[01:22:10.080 --> 01:22:15.920]  watching mine which shows we are unifying the people just under common sense yes that's exactly
[01:22:15.920 --> 01:22:21.920]  right people agree on 80 of the issues this identity politics gobbledygook is all just a
[01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:28.400]  ploy to divide the people burning people were friendly to the idea of someone lying and saying
[01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:33.200]  they want to ban all guns uh they were friendly protesters no one were no one was negative to
[01:22:33.200 --> 01:22:37.120]  me when i was and by the way the sanders people are well spoken compared to hillary supporters
[01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:41.760]  yes and they were all very supportive they said you we need to expose the fraud and the lies and
[01:22:41.760 --> 01:22:45.840]  the deceit the black people being taken advantage of in the inner cities and they're trying to ban
[01:22:45.840 --> 01:22:50.800]  guns and call it something else it's when i dress up like a hillary supporter and walk through there
[01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:55.920]  and they threw me to the ground and screamed in my face you stole the election so we are more united
[01:22:55.920 --> 01:23:01.280]  than we think those people don't have a voice on television but they have a voice with people like
[01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:06.400]  you and people like veritas and and youtube and facebook as long as facebook doesn't doesn't uh
[01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:11.360]  censor people like they did my only unopolis but we're looking into that too well in the time we've
[01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:15.120]  got left here talking about matt drudge you know drudge came here almost it was like ten one of the
[01:23:15.120 --> 01:23:19.920]  months ago he said look he said i you know i got approached supreme court justice they said next year
[01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:24.880]  they're going out of the free speech we now see it happening in europe happening here but i think it's
[01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:29.520]  going to only make people value free speech even more but clearly if they can try to boycott and
[01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:33.200]  bring down limbaugh which they failed i think limbaugh's perfect i'm not either but folks they
[01:23:33.200 --> 01:23:37.280]  get limbaugh they get everybody else if they can shut down drudge with uh federal elections
[01:23:37.280 --> 01:23:42.240]  commission garbage which i know they've been calling for they and they've said uh you know
[01:23:42.240 --> 01:23:47.200]  media matters and said go after me too they've tried to put you in prison i mean the point is
[01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:52.240]  there really is a war on the press and anybody who really is for free speech in america better
[01:23:52.240 --> 01:23:57.520]  come together because the establishment's making their move matt drudge is a hero of mine i love
[01:23:57.520 --> 01:24:02.480]  the interview he did with you and what an honor he did with you and nobody else absolutely big
[01:24:02.480 --> 01:24:07.600]  honor huge honor i i'll say this this is corporate raritas is breaking lots of local stories because
[01:24:07.600 --> 01:24:11.440]  i think the local politics is where you can make the most change and that's what we're doing in the
[01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:17.120]  last 24 hours we exposed voter fraud in michigan and instead of relying upon the mainstream press
[01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:21.200]  to get a comment from the mayor of detroit which is what i usually would do i went to the mayor's
[01:24:21.200 --> 01:24:26.800]  office with a film crew and he's and the mayor's uh uh lawyer said where's your press credentials
[01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:32.000]  and my response was the first amendment is my press credentials it doesn't draw any distinction
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:35.840]  between citizen journalists and the corporate press and the fact that you asked me for press
[01:24:35.840 --> 01:24:42.560]  credentials is the reason why we have this incestuous crap and that video is that project veritas.com
[01:24:42.560 --> 01:24:48.080]  it's very powerful i mean let's talk about this yeah this guy you're looking at right now this is
[01:24:48.080 --> 01:24:54.080]  the the mayor of detroit this is his uh uh legal counselor butch hollowwell is his name he's the
[01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:59.200]  chief lawyer for the city of detroit he threatened me and in this video later in the video you can
[01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:04.000]  hear him saying you're an accomplice to a crime and anybody who publishes your videos is an accomplice
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:09.200]  to the a accomplice to the crime i said is that nbc news an accomplice to the crime is alex jones
[01:25:09.200 --> 01:25:13.680]  is a accomplice to the crime i mean these people are so conceited that they would try to come after
[01:25:13.680 --> 01:25:18.560]  me for doing journalism is it where's your press credentials so what's the solution alex the solution
[01:25:18.560 --> 01:25:26.480]  is to record him saying that is to expose the the mentality to call his bluff call his bluff put the
[01:25:26.480 --> 01:25:31.120]  video out there of what he's saying and now he's backtracking he's been on local media all day
[01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:35.520]  you're not gonna see these stories on cnn you're gonna see them on youtube you're gonna hear me
[01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:40.720]  talk about it with you but little by little what we're doing is we're calling their bluff holding
[01:25:40.720 --> 01:25:46.640]  them accountable for their crap so that they're on defense that's what we have to do absolutely you
[01:25:46.640 --> 01:25:51.280]  know i think our greatest asset is the fact that they're so arrogant i mean i wonder why i mean the
[01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:56.320]  more quote influence i have the more concerned i get that i'd be absolutely accurate and do a good
[01:25:56.320 --> 01:26:01.760]  job with more power comes great responsibility i think of myself 20 years ago my gosh you know
[01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:05.840]  10 years ago but i look at these people the more power they get the more arrogant they get and i
[01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:10.640]  think that's their greatest weakness it is there that you're absolutely right you have a great
[01:26:10.640 --> 01:26:16.960]  power in your medium as do i a lot of responsibility we have to because we get i get hundreds of
[01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:21.360]  people a week say james you gotta come to wichita can just look at this issue there's no voice for

[01:38:10.880 --> 01:38:15.200]  effect against the new world order i mean i'm not bragging but i coined the term that hillary
[01:38:15.200 --> 01:38:20.400]  clinton was the founder of ices years ago now trump says it i said hey we need you immediately to
[01:38:20.400 --> 01:38:24.240]  come out and talk about election fraud and fight this and uh i'm not going to get it
[01:38:24.240 --> 01:38:28.640]  instead of baseball but trump was already on it so you saw what happened and uh now trump's
[01:38:28.640 --> 01:38:32.560]  doubling down on all this he's not backing off and that's why they've got the establishment
[01:38:32.560 --> 01:38:39.920]  media in total and complete panic mode now investigative journalists uh Wayne madson
[01:38:39.920 --> 01:38:46.160]  author as well by selling author formally with uh naval anti-submarine warfare before he was then
[01:38:46.160 --> 01:38:51.760]  in the national security agency before rising to one of the heads of their the major internal
[01:38:51.760 --> 01:38:59.040]  security operations i want to get his take first on william benning who was almost last week
[01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:06.400]  but another interview on i think eight uh what is it w abc in new york they're inclined and saying

[01:39:10.720 --> 01:39:18.000]  have her emails uh benning is on tomorrow also live with us to elaborate on this what does he
[01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:21.280]  think wiki least is getting ready to release the word is it's going to be the fact that hillary
[01:39:21.280 --> 01:39:26.240]  was directing with the turkish ambassador what we already knew from our military sources the
[01:39:26.240 --> 01:39:32.240]  weapons to al qaeda that she had the name changed to ices to confuse the public but then that ties

[01:40:57.680 --> 01:41:03.200]  uh you could have heard a pin drop obviously during his speech but like everything that
[01:41:03.200 --> 01:41:08.240]  take parade out every individual you've never heard before there's always a backstory and of
[01:41:08.240 --> 01:41:14.560]  course with kaiser khan there's a backstory and the fact is he's a co-founder of a academic journal
[01:41:14.560 --> 01:41:22.240]  that was basically trying to sell sharia law in uh systems of practice western jurisprudence
[01:41:22.240 --> 01:41:28.880]  based on roman law and english common law and and frankly there is no place for sharia law
[01:41:29.440 --> 01:41:36.880]  in western uh legal systems it's uh it's a practice that comes out of the uh 11th century
[01:41:36.880 --> 01:41:45.680]  uh and um and and for anyone to advance the idea that that western jurisprudence can coexist with
[01:41:45.680 --> 01:41:52.160]  sharia law is really out there where the buses don't run well let's talk about this journal
[01:41:52.160 --> 01:41:59.440]  let's get into your detailed report yeah so in and the co-founder found at this journal the other
[01:41:59.440 --> 01:42:06.400]  co-founder was an individual who ran in islam Islamic wall center in geneva switzerland
[01:42:06.400 --> 01:42:13.200]  who has been tied to the muslim brotherhood now this again uh is is very uh suspicious
[01:42:13.200 --> 01:42:21.680]  because we know that uh hillary clinton's close aide whom abadi her mother who teaches a college
[01:42:21.680 --> 01:42:27.520]  at an all-women's college by the way in jetta saudi arabia i haven't heard uh hillary clinton
[01:42:27.520 --> 01:42:37.040]  can complain about that sort of sexism um that this individual um um who was co-founded the journal
[01:42:37.680 --> 01:42:44.240]  with kaiser khan member of the muslim brotherhood and uh whom abadi's mother has uh been accused
[01:42:44.240 --> 01:42:49.760]  of having links to the muslim brotherhood so what is with all these muslim brotherhood connections
[01:42:49.760 --> 01:42:55.920]  to the hillary clinton campaign obviously the campaign found kaiser khan somehow i also pointed
[01:42:55.920 --> 01:43:02.880]  out that his law office in new york is next door to the wall door fustoria hotel uh and on the top
[01:43:02.880 --> 01:43:09.520]  of that hotel is found the residents of the u.s. ambassador to the un uh samantha power who was
[01:43:09.520 --> 01:43:16.080]  also married to k.s. sunstein obama's former informations are and the guy that said you
[01:43:16.080 --> 01:43:23.920]  defeat your enemies by practicing cognitive dissonance and uh it looks like uh the kaiser khan uh
[01:43:23.920 --> 01:43:31.360]  episode is nothing more than an an operation in cognitive dissonance as uh perfected by k.s.
[01:43:31.360 --> 01:43:37.360]  sunstein well i know people dug into his journals but specifically i mean he's promoting strict
[01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:43.680]  adherence to sharia which under that if you're found to be homosexual they murder you oh everything
[01:43:43.680 --> 01:43:49.760]  and if you if you're a muslim who converts to another religion not just christianity say buddhism
[01:43:49.760 --> 01:43:57.920]  or or scientology or anything uh the penalty is death uh so how can an how can a legal system
[01:43:57.920 --> 01:44:05.200]  like that exist uh coexist in in western uh systems it's it's not possible and for
[01:44:05.840 --> 01:44:12.720]  khan to suggest again uh he's being uh academically dishonest of course he's being disingenuous to the
[01:44:12.720 --> 01:44:16.720]  max well obviously he's brought here in the eighties he's a perfect cut out he's hooked him
[01:44:16.720 --> 01:44:22.720]  with all these other groups that supply legal help to overstay visas i mean this guy is is is
[01:44:22.720 --> 01:44:30.320]  just classic uh classic uh you know in my view he has all the signs of being one of these worldwide
[01:44:30.320 --> 01:44:36.160]  islamist operatives yeah and the other thing is you know he's a member of the new york bar which
[01:44:36.160 --> 01:44:41.120]  would explain him having an office in new york city uh although he lives in charlottesville
[01:44:41.120 --> 01:44:46.400]  virginia with his wife uh now charlottesville is a sanctuary city it's a home of the university of
[01:44:46.400 --> 01:44:52.560]  virginia but he's not a member of the virginia bar and when i suggested that he may be providing
[01:44:52.560 --> 01:44:59.760]  legal assistance to students at uva who overstay their student visas and want to become permanent
[01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:07.120]  residents by gaining the system uh i would note that apparently right after uh i i i put this report
[01:45:07.120 --> 01:45:16.000]  out uh the website for his law firm was taken down so um who knows why that why that decision was made
[01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:21.920]  but it may be that there was information on there telling uh people who are illegally in the united
[01:45:21.920 --> 01:45:29.440]  states well we better go to the wayback machine right now yeah h1b visa holders and and student visa
[01:45:29.440 --> 01:45:35.600]  holders how to gain the system i would also note that virginia you know seven of the hijackers on
[01:45:35.600 --> 01:45:42.800]  9 11 had virginia driver's licenses so virginia is a hotbed for this kind of gaming of the us
[01:45:42.800 --> 01:45:48.480]  immigration system well we're all very sad for his son but uh again we wouldn't have all these
[01:45:48.480 --> 01:45:52.560]  islamists here and all these cutouts we wouldn't have had 9 11 to begin with we wouldn't have been
[01:45:52.560 --> 01:45:57.760]  in iraq that saudi arabia directed our government to attack the country that wasn't involved i mean
[01:45:57.760 --> 01:46:02.480]  this is so clear this was done for saudi arabia saudi arabia stood to gain from all of this and
[01:46:02.480 --> 01:46:07.360]  yet the bush is meeting that morning of 9 11 at the car all group function the guardian reported
[01:46:07.360 --> 01:46:13.120]  there in dc at the bin laden family table right i would also point out something about
[01:46:13.120 --> 01:46:18.960]  something else about captain whoming and con his son it was killed in combat in bakoba iraq in o4
[01:46:20.320 --> 01:46:27.280]  um president at his funeral at arlington national cemetery was uh a muhammad sadek who was the deputy
[01:46:27.280 --> 01:46:36.000]  chief omission of the pakistani embassy in dc now capitals like dc london moscow paris
[01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:43.680]  burlin tokyo normally the dcm is the head of intelligence in this case that would have been
[01:46:43.680 --> 01:46:52.960]  pakistan's isi um and because isi was basically founded by the cia they would follow the cia's
[01:46:52.960 --> 01:46:59.680]  traditions of the dcm in those capitals being an intelligence official the chief of station
[01:47:00.640 --> 01:47:07.200]  what in the world was the head of isi intelligence doing it captain whoming con's funeral at arlington
[01:47:08.080 --> 01:47:16.320]  later he surfaces and back in islamabad in o8 justifying um are basically defending the isi
[01:47:16.320 --> 01:47:23.600]  against charges from india that the isa isi participated in the bombing of the indian msc
[01:47:23.600 --> 01:47:29.840]  in kapol afghanistan very dodgy links here pakistan was not a member of the coalition in iraq
[01:47:30.480 --> 01:47:36.720]  so what in the world was captain whoming con is a very shady grouping it needs to be investigated
[01:47:36.720 --> 01:47:40.640]  shifting gears Wayne as a journalist looking at the media just keeps saying the word is
[01:47:40.640 --> 01:47:45.680]  trump's gonna resign from because no i'm not yeah you are uh this is just what we saw with ben
[01:47:45.680 --> 01:47:51.040]  karson uh in iowa when he gets on an airplane flies out at 5 30 in the afternoon he's in second
[01:47:51.040 --> 01:47:56.800]  place they announced ten crews does that you know he's stepping down he's resigning uh you know good
[01:47:56.800 --> 01:48:02.480]  luck uh ben karson that was a big scandal that they pulled that dirty trick this is a giant
[01:48:02.480 --> 01:48:07.440]  dirty trick saying that that that trump's gonna be out of the race uh these are strong and that
[01:48:07.440 --> 01:48:15.120]  they float uh they they hope remember carl rose uh whole um idea of how to run a campaign you throw
[01:48:15.120 --> 01:48:20.880]  it against the wall even though it's untrue but you see what sticks and that's the game they're
[01:48:20.880 --> 01:48:28.880]  playing here um and uh we know that the carl robe is providing uh backdoor a consultation
[01:48:28.880 --> 01:48:36.640]  hillary clinton's campaign this is this is vintage carl robe uh floating these these red
[01:48:36.640 --> 01:48:41.920]  herrings these trial balloons these straw men i agree and isn't that the word that was probably
[01:48:41.920 --> 01:48:48.800]  rove also advising crews little karson stunt oh absolutely right yeah ro you know ro we know he
[01:48:48.800 --> 01:48:55.920]  still has his operation out of austin texas where you're at but he also uh is involved in many of
[01:48:55.920 --> 01:49:02.640]  these campaigns uh behind the scenes and that and i think when when trump recently worried
[01:49:02.640 --> 01:49:09.760]  about the election being rigged uh he knows what happened uh what rove did in 2000 and and especially
[01:49:09.760 --> 01:49:16.240]  in 2004 in ohio it's not just people voting more than once 10 times that's right ohio was certified
[01:49:16.240 --> 01:49:21.440]  to be a fraud this is bipartisan absolutely it's who counts of us remember what style and said
[01:49:21.440 --> 01:49:27.040]  it doesn't matter who votes uh but he said what really matters is who counts the but it's historic
[01:49:27.040 --> 01:49:31.200]  correct me to disagree but most experts agree in fact all of them that a landslide's hard to beat
[01:49:31.200 --> 01:49:35.680]  and that if trump makes a big issue about it and put sunshine on it and that's why i think hillary's
[01:49:35.680 --> 01:49:41.680]  campaign chief said quote what trump's doing is dangerous right you know what whether trump
[01:49:41.680 --> 01:49:48.000]  wins or loses the mere fact he talked about rigged elections which has always been uh a bet noir
[01:49:49.120 --> 01:49:52.880]  washington they don't want to talk about it because both parties have people in office
[01:49:52.880 --> 01:49:58.480]  as a result of election fraud uh he's raised that issue and whether he wins or loses i think that
[01:49:58.480 --> 01:50:02.880]  issue is going to be around and that's what the people don't like sure the upper echelon doesn't
[01:50:02.880 --> 01:50:08.560]  that just add to his bona fides that he's bringing up issues like this yeah i mean i think i think
[01:50:08.560 --> 01:50:16.160]  it uh you know it's like what they he's done more to advance the the the old story about jfk's
[01:50:16.160 --> 01:50:23.200]  assassination than anybody has in the past they 25 to 30 years yeah now trump's a god sin i mean
[01:50:23.200 --> 01:50:27.600]  everything he's done is exposed the establishment everything he's done is exposed to globalism
[01:50:27.600 --> 01:50:32.800]  everything he's done has been an absolute god sin that's why they hate him right that's that's
[01:50:32.800 --> 01:50:39.840]  correct and i think uh like i say he's provided a good service uh at least in bringing issues
[01:50:39.840 --> 01:50:44.960]  yeah yeah folks know that last year and a half i've been kind of you know sport and trump but
[01:50:44.960 --> 01:50:48.880]  you know watching closely back i say now i'm a hundred percent and this guy this guy's a hundred
[01:50:48.880 --> 01:50:54.000]  percent for real that didn't mean he's perfect none of us are but this guy is americana he doesn't
[01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:57.760]  like seeing america be destroyed he's committed his life to it we better get behind it when imagine

[01:54:12.960 --> 01:54:17.520]  video reports coming up soon they're basically like ads you know ads for free speech ads for the
[01:54:17.520 --> 01:54:21.840]  first amendment not even for the election that just show the election fraud the history of it
[01:54:21.840 --> 01:54:26.960]  how it works what hillary's done and how to counter and then also show how they're lying about
[01:54:26.960 --> 01:54:33.120]  donald trump but here's the story it's up on info wars dot com that deals with all of that
[01:54:33.120 --> 01:54:37.040]  when we were showing during the last segment of weekend guys so that people can go there
[01:54:37.040 --> 01:54:42.400]  desperate mainstream media pushes trump dropping out conspiracy theory dishonest media
[01:54:43.600 --> 01:54:49.600]  clicking its heel three times to make trump go away and then we've also are gonna post some of
[01:54:49.600 --> 01:54:54.560]  the video reports in there that deal with this but this is just like the ben karson situation
[01:54:55.120 --> 01:54:58.720]  where they just announced he's given up but but but back then it was a big deal
[01:54:59.600 --> 01:55:04.880]  this is the whole media doing it not just cruise so they kind of all commit the crime against free
[01:55:04.880 --> 01:55:12.640]  speech the crime against truth and then just hope that no one group gets the blame this is in unison
[01:55:12.640 --> 01:55:18.240]  talking points as the wiki link show directly from hillary clinton i mean talk about dishonor i
[01:55:18.240 --> 01:55:24.160]  am shocked that even mainstream media is this unified in dirt baggery speaking of that i want
[01:55:24.160 --> 01:55:29.280]  to get wane madson's take on it as he counters these these folks but here speaking of dirt bags
[01:55:29.280 --> 01:55:35.840]  here is obama saying yesterday that listen if you're anti-government how about anti-corrupt
[01:55:35.840 --> 01:55:40.960]  government get out of here you didn't build the country you didn't save general motors and all
[01:55:40.960 --> 01:55:48.720]  this stuff which was another scam here it is and uh and and and you know i always tell people who
[01:55:48.720 --> 01:55:53.120]  are anti-government here in the united states try going to a country where the government doesn't
[01:55:53.120 --> 01:56:01.120]  work and you'll see that you actually want a good government it's a useful thing to have
[01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:07.360]  but it's not enough on its own if you also don't have then the ability of people in the private
[01:56:07.360 --> 01:56:13.920]  sector to like the economic collapse of venezuela it's so bad that people are slaughtering and
[01:56:13.920 --> 01:56:19.760]  eating zoo animals that's up on info wars dot com from michael schneider uh this this implication
[01:56:19.760 --> 01:56:25.920]  that government made all this instead of innovation and lower taxes wane it's really getting crazy you
[01:56:25.920 --> 01:56:31.440]  want to tackle that first or the the the earlier point i was making well i i think the media is
[01:56:31.440 --> 01:56:38.400]  being absolutely um um horrible and covering uh trump by pushing forth they're the one first
[01:56:38.400 --> 01:56:43.600]  ones that start talking about conspiracy theories and and how terrible they are and then they are
[01:56:43.600 --> 01:56:49.360]  pushing a conspiracy theory now there was a story out of new york yesterday that's got no play on
[01:56:49.360 --> 01:56:56.160]  the national media apparently a retired law enforcement officer was arrested trying to sneak
[01:56:56.160 --> 01:57:02.880]  into trump power uh just before trump returned from the campaign for in florida he had a weapon on
[01:57:02.880 --> 01:57:08.880]  him uh and they that basically new york daily news which hates trump said oh it was no big thing the
[01:57:08.880 --> 01:57:16.000]  guy was drunk uh you know so you know where where is the mainstream on issues like that
[01:57:16.560 --> 01:57:23.520]  clearly uh a lot of people feel that with the enemies he's creating trump uh maybe in some
[01:57:23.520 --> 01:57:27.760]  sort of physical danger oh that's my next question we know they're coming after him physically now
[01:57:27.760 --> 01:57:33.840]  i mean i mean the panic level we're seeing right and look you know jeb jeb bush he feels like this
[01:57:33.840 --> 01:57:38.880]  thing was taken from him like uh you know you take candy from a baby you know he would he was
[01:57:38.880 --> 01:57:44.720]  supposed to be the third bush and and we know what the bush is anywhere capable of now there was one
[01:57:44.720 --> 01:57:52.320]  report that the person arrested and at a trump tower was using the fake identity of an fbi agent

[02:00:35.520 --> 02:00:39.440]  Wayne madson's our guest for another five minutes then i should have plugged this earlier this
[02:00:39.440 --> 02:00:44.960]  guy's a wild man superstar the founder of vice till they went sideways uh gavin mcganis
[02:00:44.960 --> 02:00:49.280]  this compound media dot com he's going to be joining us talk about all this we'll take phone
[02:00:49.280 --> 02:00:53.680]  calls i got a special report paul watson did on hillary really acted like she's a mental patient
[02:00:53.680 --> 02:00:56.880]  and again folks you know i don't just hype something because it sounds like something fun to
[02:00:56.880 --> 02:01:01.680]  hype there's always enough real stuff to go with hillary's acting so freakazoi just when i
[02:01:01.680 --> 02:01:06.960]  normally see her she's either all enraged looking or she looks like she's on drugs and then she
[02:01:06.960 --> 02:01:11.920]  does these weird things where she just goes and people like are you okay or like the balloons
[02:01:11.920 --> 02:01:18.000]  like a little baby going oh uh you're a smart guy uh Wayne madson what do you think's going on with
[02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:26.880]  hillary well look we still don't know what happened when she had that uh uh episode with uh a brain
[02:01:26.880 --> 02:01:33.680]  issue uh apparently as a result of a fall when she was secretary of state even her husband said it
[02:01:33.680 --> 02:01:40.320]  was more bill clinton said it was more serious than what had been reported so again uh usually
[02:01:40.320 --> 02:01:46.880]  medical issues are off limits during campaigns but as we know from the 72 campaign when mcgovern
[02:01:46.880 --> 02:01:53.840]  had to drop senator tom eagleton off the ticket as vice president yes medical issues are uh a very
[02:01:53.840 --> 02:01:59.200]  cogent issue during a presidential campaign because uh whether it's president or vice president
[02:01:59.200 --> 02:02:03.680]  this is the person that's going to be in charge of the country or potentially in charge of the
[02:02:03.680 --> 02:02:09.600]  country and their medical conditions should be uh at issue and uh sure but i mean normal people
[02:02:09.600 --> 02:02:14.320]  don't start doing these weird tics i mean this is stuff i see like homeless folks that are schizophrenic
[02:02:14.320 --> 02:02:19.040]  on the side of the road yeah and even after that episode uh hillary was wearing some special
[02:02:19.040 --> 02:02:24.800]  glasses which are for people who have trouble keeping their balance after some sort of uh
[02:02:24.800 --> 02:02:32.560]  episodic event uh dealing with the brain so so so you're leaning towards stroke i would say stroke
[02:02:32.560 --> 02:02:40.080]  or an aneurysm uh that they thought before it was fatal but there's obviously and it could be as you
[02:02:40.080 --> 02:02:47.680]  suggest prescription medication she's on uh but uh yeah i think there should be uh questions asked
[02:02:47.680 --> 02:02:53.600]  about her uh her physical what about bill clinton when i say he looks like a corpse when i say he
[02:02:53.600 --> 02:02:59.520]  looks like a zombo i mean i really he could be in a movie as a zombie now well you know he's had
[02:02:59.520 --> 02:03:05.920]  heart surgery too and and you know we know he was a major user of cocaine in his younger days and
[02:03:05.920 --> 02:03:10.640]  i i think all that catches up with you after a while look at some of these aging rock stars
[02:03:10.640 --> 02:03:16.320]  and and they can't even pronounce two words uh together uh later on in life the word is he's
[02:03:16.320 --> 02:03:21.360]  on coke until just a few years ago oh yeah absolutely and uh we know that we're not just
[02:03:21.360 --> 02:03:27.200]  picking on democrats we know that yours w the bush had an affectation for the white powder as well
[02:03:27.200 --> 02:03:34.080]  and nixon took a lot of pills yeah nixon nixon was uh drunkard uh and a pill popper especially
[02:03:34.080 --> 02:03:39.680]  towards the end but but you know it's fair game for anyone republican or democrat they're they're
[02:03:39.680 --> 02:03:45.440]  medical of course the media is not touching it because uh they're uh sure that's we got one
[02:03:45.440 --> 02:03:49.040]  minute left way madson what else do you expect them to go after trump with because it's gotten
[02:03:49.040 --> 02:03:54.880]  crazy i think i think his wife is the one where they're going after now malania there's suggestions
[02:03:54.880 --> 02:04:03.120]  being floated that she was uh working in the united states uh illegally when she was a model uh and uh
[02:04:03.120 --> 02:04:09.360]  now there's some suggestions and this this bears all the markings of a carl rove uh that she uh was
[02:04:09.360 --> 02:04:14.880]  some sort of an escort at one time uh none of this of course is probable but remember the
[02:04:14.880 --> 02:04:19.840]  the robe paradigm it doesn't matter if it's true or not throw it against the wall and see what
[02:04:19.840 --> 02:04:24.480]  plus it's all off limits because trump doesn't make a big issue at all that stuff right right
[02:04:24.480 --> 02:04:29.600]  you know and uh i mean we know everything there is to know about trump's personal life he used to
[02:04:29.600 --> 02:04:36.240]  be on the cover of people magazine in the 1980s ad nauseam ad infinitum it was always a trump's
[02:04:36.240 --> 02:04:43.600]  story studio 54 whatever it was you know so there's not much more there absolutely well she's a
[02:04:43.600 --> 02:04:47.920]  beautiful woman i guess that's her only crime with these a lot of these so-called feminists
[02:04:47.920 --> 02:04:51.840]  who just really want to run women's lives and boss women around and are really a
[02:04:51.840 --> 02:04:54.880]  cretinist group of people wane madson thank you so much we'll talk to you again soon
[02:04:56.640 --> 02:04:57.680]  have them again straight up
[02:05:00.800 --> 02:05:06.160]  one of the reasons there is so much anxiety about mrs clinton from the intelligence community
[02:05:06.160 --> 02:05:11.280]  is the belief that some of the materials that she handled with such extreme carelessness i'm using
[02:05:11.280 --> 02:05:19.280]  jim comey's phrase in my opinion it was criminal but contained the names of american undercover
[02:05:19.280 --> 02:05:25.280]  intelligence agents some of whom are no longer with us this is the belief of a lot of people
[02:05:25.280 --> 02:05:31.680]  in the intelligence community what difference at this point does it make it is our job to figure
[02:05:31.680 --> 02:05:36.320]  out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again just like
[02:05:36.320 --> 02:05:41.200]  ben gazi it does make a difference to the people who died to their families even though it makes
[02:05:41.200 --> 02:05:47.280]  no difference to her she is right about one thing however the way you prevent the betrayal of americans
[02:05:47.280 --> 02:05:52.080]  who put their lives on the line to protect the country is to keep this self-centered
[02:05:52.080 --> 02:05:58.560]  warmongering corrupt politician from ever holding office again grandpa wars dot com

[02:07:58.160 --> 02:08:05.920]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[02:08:08.080 --> 02:08:11.280]  look it's real simple there are people that want to conquer nations
[02:08:12.160 --> 02:08:16.720]  and control everything and create poverty so they can sit over you and lord over you
[02:08:16.720 --> 02:08:22.640]  and then dictate the terms of your surrender then there are people who are confident and who
[02:08:22.640 --> 02:08:27.040]  want to produce incredible wealth and turn everybody loose as long as you don't take
[02:08:27.040 --> 02:08:33.440]  something from them that you didn't earn those are called confident people it's renaissance
[02:08:33.440 --> 02:08:40.080]  culture versus conquest culture in every system and in every time in history there's been a mix
[02:08:40.080 --> 02:08:48.240]  of those two but north korea is a pure conquest slave culture uh you could call maybe the netherlands
[02:08:48.240 --> 02:08:57.200]  100 years ago uh you know a pure innovation culture and it's innovation that creates high culture
[02:08:57.920 --> 02:09:04.960]  incredible true diversity and incredible choices and everything the so-called liberals are doing
[02:09:04.960 --> 02:09:10.160]  is about destroying those choices and that's why i can't stand them i mean because they're not just
[02:09:10.160 --> 02:09:16.080]  totalitarians they claim they built all this renaissance like obama i played the clip last
[02:09:16.080 --> 02:09:20.720]  hour we're gonna play it coming up he is running around right now
[02:09:23.200 --> 02:09:31.200]  saying that he and the government built our prosperity i've got the full quotes in an article
[02:09:31.200 --> 02:09:35.280]  it's a shorter clip he said you know if you like roads you like general motors you like
[02:09:35.280 --> 02:09:42.400]  business you like jobs it's the government that's the craziest thing historically uh it is individual
[02:09:42.400 --> 02:09:50.160]  systems and ideas and large populations that produce civilization i mean i love bill marr
[02:09:50.160 --> 02:09:54.320]  bitching i play the clip he goes i i want more death i want more abortion i want more murder
[02:09:54.320 --> 02:09:59.920]  whatever gets the freeway moving hey dumbo there's a big freeway in a mega city because there's 15
[02:09:59.920 --> 02:10:09.360]  million people in los angeles and the greater area and yeah you swim into a coral reef there's
[02:10:09.360 --> 02:10:14.320]  like 10 000 fish like oh there's too many fish you might go 10 miles for you see more fish
[02:10:14.320 --> 02:10:18.560]  it's the same thing you see all these people that's the opportunity if you don't like people go to
[02:10:18.560 --> 02:10:24.560]  the countryside believe me sometimes i want to but don't say there's too many of them kill them
[02:10:24.560 --> 02:10:28.240]  so i can get on the freeway there won't be a freeway dumbo
[02:10:31.520 --> 02:10:35.680]  the truth is these are very unhappy people and that's why they're out to get society and you
[02:10:35.680 --> 02:10:39.440]  look at how hateful hillary clinton is he's a great example you have him again this is train
[02:10:39.440 --> 02:10:45.360]  had a problem so he's gonna be with us in about 10 minutes or so let's go to this paul joseph watson
[02:10:45.360 --> 02:10:51.280]  report dealing with hillary clinton it's up on info wars dot com
[02:10:53.840 --> 02:10:57.920]  and we'll also put that article up on screen so tv viewers can actually get the url
[02:10:57.920 --> 02:11:06.720]  because this needs to go extremely extremely viral it deals with hillary clinton and her
[02:11:06.720 --> 02:11:14.480]  medical condition experts hillary is a sociopath and could have brain damage i think she looks
[02:11:14.480 --> 02:11:20.000]  like she has a rubber mask on is about to pull it off i mean she looks like the woman that basically
[02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:24.480]  goes into the white house and mars attacks and pulls the mask off and she's a big green alien
[02:11:24.480 --> 02:11:30.240]  now i'm not saying she's actually a green alien i'm saying she looks like a cross between
[02:11:31.200 --> 02:11:37.040]  the joker and the wicked witch of the west i want to know where the flying monkeys are
[02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:43.120]  this that's her assistant or ever umma abedine or or uh or or bill clinton's like a flying
[02:11:43.680 --> 02:11:49.280]  flying flying monkey but there's got to be some into this so if you're a radio listener
[02:11:49.280 --> 02:11:53.440]  it's paul narrating if you're a tv viewer on stations here and there on the country or
[02:11:53.440 --> 02:11:57.920]  and then paul wars dot com forward slash show this video should be seen by everybody because
[02:11:57.920 --> 02:12:03.360]  she looks and acts like a total whack job if i was interviewing somebody for a job and they
[02:12:03.360 --> 02:12:09.040]  were doing stuff like this i would ask them uh you know uh if they needed uh drink of water
[02:12:09.040 --> 02:12:17.280]  for they left because i wouldn't be i wouldn't be wanting to be around someone who's obviously
[02:12:17.280 --> 02:12:22.560]  psychonic i mean i mean i mean she looks like again a person that you see on the side of the road
[02:12:22.560 --> 02:12:27.360]  who's a full blown schizophrenic but if i have to analyze her from the psychological studies i'd say
[02:12:27.360 --> 02:12:33.040]  she's a hardcore borderline personality disorder uh leaning into full psychosis on a bunch of
[02:12:33.040 --> 02:12:37.200]  different fronts and who routinely has psychotic breaks she doesn't give tips you can't look her
[02:12:37.200 --> 02:12:41.360]  in the eyes she treats the secret service like dog crap she yells and screams at other protective
[02:12:41.360 --> 02:12:49.360]  details it's all on record that she is a lunatic here's a special report what on earth could be
[02:12:49.360 --> 02:12:56.560]  the reason behind hillary clinton's bizarre behavior in recent weeks weird seizures psychotic
[02:12:56.560 --> 02:13:05.040]  facial tics over exaggerated reactions coughing fits strange lesions on her tongue is hillary on
[02:13:05.040 --> 02:13:11.440]  the verge of a mental breakdown due to stress or are her strange outbursts linked to a medical
[02:13:11.440 --> 02:13:17.760]  condition is clinton suffering from actual brain damage or are these odd manifestations
[02:13:17.760 --> 02:13:23.840]  just an expression of some kind of narcissistic personality disorder i talked privately with
[02:13:23.840 --> 02:13:28.720]  psychologists and psychiatrists to try and answer this question and here's what they told me
[02:13:29.440 --> 02:13:35.680]  we know hillary fainted and hit her head back in 2012 leading to a blood clot in her brain in almost
[02:13:35.680 --> 02:13:42.320]  half of sufferers this leads to side effects and neurological issues according to neurologist dr
[02:13:42.320 --> 02:13:48.240]  daniel casichet hillary has post concussion syndrome and cannot tolerate stress inducing
[02:13:48.240 --> 02:13:55.360]  environments experts told me that this footage likely shows hillary having a mild jacksonian
[02:13:55.360 --> 02:14:01.920]  type of seizure caused by a side effect of the blood clot notice how shocked the reporter is
[02:14:01.920 --> 02:14:09.040]  by her behavior and how hillary tries to turn it into a joke but then continues having the seizure
[02:14:09.040 --> 02:14:14.640]  notice how it was triggered by several different people talking to her at once which is a known
[02:14:14.640 --> 02:14:22.320]  cause of seizures is this why hillary refuses to give press conferences we see similar traits in
[02:14:22.320 --> 02:14:30.560]  this footage the crazy eye movements the overreaction to external stimuli the weird elongated bathroom
[02:14:30.560 --> 02:14:36.000]  break in the middle of a televised debate which insiders said was a flare up of problems from
[02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:41.920]  her brain injury and we believe secretary clinton will be coming around the corner any minute reports
[02:14:41.920 --> 02:14:48.320]  that she can barely stand up after giving a speech the coughing fits which is yet another side effect
[02:14:48.320 --> 02:15:00.240]  of strokes almost say put her hand man difficulty swallowing choking a garbled voice again all
[02:15:00.240 --> 02:15:06.240]  side effects of strokes cause nuclear war guess what else is a side effect of strokes spontaneous
[02:15:06.240 --> 02:15:12.400]  outbursts of laughter that go on for longer than is socially comfortable i know bernie sanders said
[02:15:12.400 --> 02:15:17.600]  that quote the american people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails but there are
[02:15:17.600 --> 02:15:24.720]  a lot of people who are not well including fbi officials some aspects of hillary's freakish
[02:15:24.720 --> 02:15:31.280]  behavior could be explained by the blood clot but others could be a manifestation of her notoriously
[02:15:31.280 --> 02:15:38.080]  unstable personality and even drug abuse her sudden profound and disproportionate
[02:15:38.080 --> 02:15:45.440]  bouts of rage confirmed by former secret service agents former k9 handlers and her own campaign
[02:15:45.440 --> 02:15:51.840]  insiders an anonymous campaign aide told the new york post that hillary unleashed quote screaming
[02:15:51.840 --> 02:15:59.280]  childlike tantrums that have left staff members in tears and unable to work bern paints a disturbing
[02:15:59.280 --> 02:16:05.200]  picture of what he claims hillary is like behind the scenes when something goes wrong she seems to
[02:16:05.200 --> 02:16:10.560]  go right off the scale instead of trying to fix what the problem is she uh she goes right to anger
[02:16:10.560 --> 02:16:16.800]  and berets who she holds responsible for bern told me that as first lady hillary actually hit a
[02:16:16.800 --> 02:16:22.160]  secret service agent in the back of the head with a bible she became angry about something she had a
[02:16:22.160 --> 02:16:26.400]  bible in her hand she didn't actually throw it at him as he described it to me she leaned forward
[02:16:26.400 --> 02:16:31.600]  and kind of punched him in the head with it he says the clinton white house was like a battlefield
[02:16:31.600 --> 02:16:36.560]  and the president showed up one morning with a black eye to prove it they even said they had to
[02:16:36.560 --> 02:16:44.080]  give her quote chill pills to calm her down these outbursts are likely linked to years of persistent
[02:16:44.080 --> 02:16:50.160]  drug abuse her susceptibility to rage whenever she's challenged would also explain the complete
[02:16:50.160 --> 02:16:57.120]  dearth of press conferences and why her campaign builds human walls to keep reporters away hillary
[02:16:57.120 --> 02:17:04.160]  is also likely on the autism spectrum she has virtually no empathy for other people one expert
[02:17:04.160 --> 02:17:12.080]  told me that hillary has high functioning autism with attendant sociopathy yep we came we saw
[02:17:12.080 --> 02:17:22.080]  oh he died this would explain the exaggerated expressions there to compensate for what psychiatrists
[02:17:22.080 --> 02:17:30.000]  call emotional illiteracy could this be why her efforts to connect with people seem so forced
[02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:40.160]  so insincere i'm just chilling in cedar rapids there's even speculation that she could have
[02:17:40.160 --> 02:17:48.000]  contracted syphilis from sex addict bill clinton which may explain the apparent lesion on her tongue
[02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:54.800]  then you have the memory lapses huma avidine saying hillary is quote often confused the pathological
[02:17:54.800 --> 02:18:02.480]  lies about being under bosnian sniper fire the lies about her email scandal all signs of cognitive
[02:18:02.480 --> 02:18:10.960]  impairment personality disorder all both all this while the clinton campaign claims her only
[02:18:10.960 --> 02:18:18.000]  issues are allergies and hyperthyroidism hillary could be mentally incapacitated and incapable
[02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:26.480]  of handling stress even before she takes on the most stressful job in the world barack obama
[02:18:26.480 --> 02:18:32.800]  claims donald trump is unfit to be president because of his rhetoric but is hillary clinton
[02:18:33.440 --> 02:18:43.360]  physically unfit to be president she's obviously mentally you know she's out of control
[02:18:43.360 --> 02:18:49.680]  evil people particularly uh folks like her rot as they get older mentally it's a historical fact
[02:18:50.960 --> 02:18:55.440]  as she is a clear and present danger to this republic part of me wants you to go ahead and
[02:18:55.440 --> 02:18:59.520]  just get in and totally wreck this whole global system forever they think she's going to save it
[02:18:59.520 --> 02:19:06.160]  oh she'll end it unless she has a nuclear war and this is somebody who has a thing out to
[02:19:06.160 --> 02:19:14.000]  dominate women and men and who's extremely warlike and uh in the russians of pegger they
[02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:17.360]  think she's very very dangerous and is in is really going to escalate the situation
[02:19:18.080 --> 02:19:21.200]  and the pentagon is carried over they have a lot of intelligence analysts that have come out and
[02:19:21.200 --> 02:19:26.560]  said hillary is super bad news i've talked to soldiers multiple soldiers that protected hillary
[02:19:26.560 --> 02:19:33.680]  clinton when she was a secretary of state in iraq and other countries and um it's like she
[02:19:33.680 --> 02:19:40.800]  goes under mind control trance well i'm not even a liberty to tell these stories i was going to
[02:19:40.800 --> 02:19:49.600]  stop right there people wouldn't believe it anyways this country is in so much trouble and so is the
[02:19:49.600 --> 02:19:55.280]  world but basically hillary just cuts off in a car like a robot she just sits there goes into a trance
[02:19:55.280 --> 02:20:21.280]  well you know when they're driving through bag that or whatever she is something's wrong with her

[02:24:27.360 --> 02:24:33.040]  islamic attacks france water park to hold burkini day non-muslim swimming attire band
[02:24:33.040 --> 02:24:38.560]  we told you that was coming next it's all part of in pecking us into submission it's why is islam
[02:24:38.560 --> 02:24:42.560]  extreme forms of it obviously orthodox islam works so well with the left because it's so
[02:24:42.560 --> 02:24:49.440]  anti-liberal uh but continuing here with what i was getting into the economic collapse in venez
[02:24:49.440 --> 02:24:57.920]  vela that people are slaughtering and eating zoo animals it's gotten that bad it's just murder
[02:24:57.920 --> 02:25:04.240]  on the streets burning cities starvation it's getting worse by the minute but this is a communist
[02:25:04.240 --> 02:25:10.720]  utopia but don't worry it pays the biggest amount of money back of any latin american country the
[02:25:10.720 --> 02:25:15.440]  imf and world bank so they're good little slaves of the new world order following through with all
[02:25:15.440 --> 02:25:20.720]  of that now here's obama a few years ago saying you didn't build your business and now he's
[02:25:20.720 --> 02:25:24.240]  come back and said that you know if you don't like america because america's all about big
[02:25:24.240 --> 02:25:29.040]  government get out of america even though everybody knows america was posing about small government
[02:25:29.040 --> 02:25:35.600]  here's the clip if you've been successful you don't you didn't get there on your own absolutely
[02:25:35.600 --> 02:25:41.520]  nice you didn't get there on your own i'm always struck by people who think well it must be because
[02:25:41.520 --> 02:25:47.440]  i was just so smart there are a lot of smart people out there it must be because i worked
[02:25:47.440 --> 02:25:50.480]  harder than everybody else let me tell you something there are a whole bunch of hard
[02:25:50.480 --> 02:25:55.600]  working people out there collectivism claiming your work is somebody else's flavor it's the name of it
[02:25:56.960 --> 02:26:04.080]  if you were successful somebody along the line gave you some help there was a great teacher
[02:26:04.080 --> 02:26:10.080]  somewhere in your life good pause real quick this is the essence of class envy obviously your
[02:26:10.080 --> 02:26:14.080]  mother gave birth to you and wiped your butt and fed you and took care of you obviously grandma and
[02:26:14.080 --> 02:26:19.440]  grandpa did that daddy did obviously teachers helped you but to imply though that you can't say
[02:26:19.440 --> 02:26:25.520]  you built something if a painter teaches you how to paint they helped you but you painted that painting
[02:26:26.880 --> 02:26:35.280]  if if if nico in their books a guest or comes up with an idea or if matt does or if ali does
[02:26:35.280 --> 02:26:46.640]  they did that if i go lift weights or go jog i did that by the way when i screw up i did that too
[02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:52.000]  but the idea that hey you didn't do that we all have a right to what you did
[02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:56.880]  okay well on average the average person in the u.s pays about 45 in some form of tax
[02:26:57.680 --> 02:27:00.640]  if you're upper middle class you pay 40 federal tax alone
[02:27:00.640 --> 02:27:09.040]  65 70 tax france has a 75 federal tax on average a bunch of other taxes at about 90
[02:27:10.480 --> 02:27:16.560]  on upper middle class in new vorice people making a million euros a year it's 101 for five years
[02:27:16.560 --> 02:27:23.680]  running totally regressive to control everyone because the elites all have loopholes and not
[02:27:23.680 --> 02:27:30.480]  pay the tax they're consolidating power now i mean serfs in ancient europe had to pay 10 to 20 percent
[02:27:32.560 --> 02:27:36.720]  to the king to the noble that worked for the king
[02:27:39.120 --> 02:27:46.000]  i pay upwards of 70 in taxes is is is that enough can i can i keep 30 and let me explain
[02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:49.920]  something the way they've changed the rules because i have law firms and cpa's i've i've
[02:27:49.920 --> 02:27:55.520]  gone around since obama got in i thought it was bad before they take new equipment and stuff i buy
[02:27:55.520 --> 02:28:01.520]  supposedly is is is owned by the company and owned by me and we pay taxes on it every year
[02:28:01.520 --> 02:28:07.920]  and it appreciates out it's it's incredible it's hard to even buy stuff computers and cameras
[02:28:10.160 --> 02:28:13.840]  and on top of what i pay crew members i got to match their social security and fight just
[02:28:14.800 --> 02:28:19.440]  but see the average person doesn't run a company so they don't know so they hear obama up there
[02:28:19.440 --> 02:28:23.520]  now saying hey if you don't think the government did all this and you don't like big government
[02:28:23.520 --> 02:28:32.000]  just get out of here here it is this is yesterday and uh and and and you know i always tell people
[02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:36.880]  who are anti-government here in the united states try going to a country where the government doesn't
[02:28:36.880 --> 02:28:44.320]  work what's wrong with people like you that you actually want a good government it's a useful
[02:28:44.320 --> 02:28:50.640]  thing to have but it's not enough on its own if you also don't have then the ability of people in
[02:28:50.640 --> 02:28:57.280]  the private sector yeah the multinationals coming in to exploit the people so i said communism's good
[02:28:57.280 --> 02:29:04.800]  remember in in in south america argentina he said communism really helpful but we need
[02:29:04.800 --> 02:29:09.360]  internationally multinational corporations that come and work with it you're a slave under communism
[02:29:09.360 --> 02:29:13.920]  and the big banks come in above the law land and helicopters and run your slave factory
[02:29:13.920 --> 02:29:19.520]  or run your mind and you get nothing but there's guys with red flags and machine guns aimed at you
[02:29:19.520 --> 02:29:25.440]  that you know rape your wife uh so everything is really really cute and fun now when we come back
[02:29:25.440 --> 02:29:34.480]  clinton eastwood trump challenging obama's pussy generation just effing it over at 86 year old actor
[02:29:34.480 --> 02:29:40.400]  says i gotta tell you the biggest all-time actor of all time and i really love clinton eastwood's
[02:29:40.400 --> 02:29:46.640]  courage i love all these jackasses go he's 86 years old you know shut up this guy still produces
[02:29:46.640 --> 02:29:51.760]  and directs movies that most of you could never even do so shut up you collectivist thumbsuckers
[02:29:53.360 --> 02:29:56.240]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:30:00.960 --> 02:30:06.320]  one of the reasons there is so much anxiety about mrs clinton from the intelligence community
[02:30:06.320 --> 02:30:11.440]  is the belief that some of the materials that she handled with such extreme carelessness i'm using
[02:30:11.440 --> 02:30:19.440]  jim comey's phrase in my opinion it was criminal but contained the names of american undercover
[02:30:19.440 --> 02:30:25.440]  intelligence agents some of whom are no longer with us this is the belief of a lot of people
[02:30:25.440 --> 02:30:31.840]  in the intelligence community what difference at this point does it make it is our job to figure
[02:30:31.840 --> 02:30:36.560]  out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again just like

[02:30:41.680 --> 02:30:47.520]  difference to her she is right about one thing however the way you prevent the betrayal of americans

[02:33:29.440 --> 02:33:37.200]  put me in a haze to the central texas and the heart of the resistance you're listening to alex
[02:33:37.200 --> 02:33:44.960]  john's i roll for 40 days last night in the little rock put me in a haze

[02:33:48.400 --> 02:33:51.920]  because i got to go to a meeting or i'd be here the next 30 minutes act with that in fourth hour
[02:33:51.920 --> 02:33:57.840]  jevon mcginnis um twitter at gabin underscore mcginnis uh and of course he's got his own big
[02:33:57.840 --> 02:34:03.520]  media operation he's one one of the guys that founded uh vice uh big fan of it back when he
[02:34:03.520 --> 02:34:09.680]  ran at compound media dot com and hosts his own global transmission every day so you can find that
[02:34:09.680 --> 02:34:13.280]  effect up against me which is great they blow my head off gabin mcginnis is still there because
[02:34:13.280 --> 02:34:16.560]  i'm not in competition with this guy i'm in competition with those that want to in competition
[02:34:16.560 --> 02:34:20.960]  maracus st obama who we just played the clip saying government even though there's a full
[02:34:20.960 --> 02:34:25.360]  speech had to play all of it it creates everything you didn't build your business that you know it's
[02:34:25.360 --> 02:34:33.760]  kind of part two of that the all-out assault on trump they're now saying uh that uh malania kept
[02:34:33.760 --> 02:34:38.960]  going back and forth and and getting visitor visas and so she might have been illegal but she then
[02:34:38.960 --> 02:34:43.360]  became a citizen and that she might have been an escort that's the new attack imagine they were
[02:34:43.360 --> 02:34:47.600]  attacking a a democrats wife saying she might have been an escort uh look trump never said
[02:34:47.600 --> 02:34:51.440]  block people up who have escorts but i don't think she was an escort uh the point is is that this
[02:34:51.440 --> 02:34:57.520]  is getting crazy and so i'm wondering where does this go where does this go next so gabin mcginnis
[02:34:57.520 --> 02:35:03.200]  joins us where should we start i mean i gotta say this is the most entertaining thing i've
[02:35:03.200 --> 02:35:07.680]  ever seen people that say they're bored gabin i don't know what planet they're living on this is
[02:35:08.240 --> 02:35:14.400]  sensational everywhere you can't throw a stick without you know hitting some ultra massive
[02:35:14.400 --> 02:35:18.320]  sensational incredibleness i mean i am i am i am actually in heaven right now
[02:35:18.320 --> 02:35:22.640]  yeah i don't say that to people at fox too who aren't on the trump train i go
[02:35:22.640 --> 02:35:28.080]  you're an entertainer this guy is a right-wing entertainer i don't understand why you don't
[02:35:28.080 --> 02:35:32.560]  support him what are you crazy at the very least even if you're a little you have to admit this
[02:35:32.560 --> 02:35:39.120]  is the first time and i'm going to say a quarter century the dads have even cared about an election
[02:35:39.120 --> 02:35:44.240]  they're answering questions on polls they're asking americans are asking details about contested
[02:35:44.240 --> 02:35:49.120]  conventions and all this minutiae about congress for the first time ever we care and that's because
[02:35:49.120 --> 02:35:54.960]  it's exciting so i think we are seeing a major reawakening happening i threw out quite a platter
[02:35:54.960 --> 02:35:59.600]  there what do you want to tackle first well this one millennia is curious and i was shocked to see
[02:35:59.600 --> 02:36:04.480]  the new york new york coast is doing it because they've been with trauma since the beginning
[02:36:04.480 --> 02:36:12.720]  but it seems like they want to hillary's people their only card is genitalia women women women
[02:36:12.720 --> 02:36:16.560]  and they've noticed that when you bring up millennia probably because she's so stunning
[02:36:16.560 --> 02:36:22.480]  that it loses women's vote actually met a woman at the airport and she was complaining about
[02:36:22.480 --> 02:36:27.840]  millennia and she's saying i don't want a whore for the first lady she yelled at in the airport bar
[02:36:27.840 --> 02:36:32.080]  and i just thought these women are unhinged why did we have the ninth amendment do you think liberals
[02:36:32.080 --> 02:36:38.080]  would love the girl on girls shoot yeah no they're too they have to be ugly for them to like
[02:36:38.080 --> 02:36:43.600]  lesbians they have to be pursued and be wearing uh so Janet Reno and hillary would be okay
[02:36:44.560 --> 02:36:50.000]  yeah they have to be african-american women of color for it to be interesting with really ugly
[02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:55.600]  tattoos you know masculine eyes but they're really going for this emotional vote and i read
[02:36:55.600 --> 02:36:59.360]  an interview with michael more of all people and he said 81 percent of voters are female
[02:36:59.360 --> 02:37:05.920]  visual minority or young and those are all or those are disproportionately emotional groups
[02:37:05.920 --> 02:37:11.680]  and if you just keep hammering this same propaganda on them it's going to be a real force to be
[02:37:11.680 --> 02:37:16.080]  reckoned with because the same ones the dads are the only ones voting with their brains
[02:37:17.600 --> 02:37:21.200]  and by the way it's not like the quote women minorities are getting something going with
[02:37:21.200 --> 02:37:25.440]  hillary and the globalist they want them even more poor that's why they target them i mean this
[02:37:25.440 --> 02:37:31.440]  is so obvious that's the frustrating things is it progresses in their mind it goes like this
[02:37:31.440 --> 02:37:36.560]  there's the left that wants to help the poor and give blacks welfare and that's nice
[02:37:36.560 --> 02:37:41.520]  and then there's the mean republicans who want to deny everyone they're all about austerity and
[02:37:41.520 --> 02:37:45.600]  they say you don't need money you're a you're a lazy piece of trash it's never occurred to them
[02:37:45.600 --> 02:37:50.720]  that we here on the right the libertarians the conservatives a lot of the republicans we don't
[02:37:50.720 --> 02:37:55.440]  like welfare for black people because we don't think it's good for them and we've seen examples
[02:37:55.440 --> 02:38:00.560]  of this time and time again look at american indians they've been hurt with welfare and freebies
[02:38:00.560 --> 02:38:05.120]  freebies leave you worse off well sure i mean the reservation was set up to dehumanize them
[02:38:05.840 --> 02:38:12.000]  exactly the whole but we weren't we didn't evolve to like free stuff we didn't evolve to get free
[02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:17.920]  college we evolved to have punishment for bad decisions and if you spend a quarter million
[02:38:17.920 --> 02:38:25.760]  dollars taking speech pathology at nyu you've got to be punished that was a dumb move well look
[02:38:25.760 --> 02:38:29.200]  at how they say don't feed the squirrels at the park i mean because they turn into these obese
[02:38:29.200 --> 02:38:34.960]  mindless lazy creatures yes well they like they still like to talk about how the poor in america
[02:38:34.960 --> 02:38:39.760]  are starving and how there's so many hungry children john stossel summed it up best he goes
[02:38:39.760 --> 02:38:43.760]  he said uh the biggest problem america has right now is that our poor eat too much
[02:38:45.760 --> 02:38:49.360]  well look i've been overweight before myself so a little bit but i gotta tell you i was in
[02:38:49.360 --> 02:38:53.280]  san tanio yesterday ten current business and it's the fattest city in the u.s and you're driving
[02:38:53.280 --> 02:38:57.200]  around it's like being in the movie walley i don't hate these people i feel sorry for them but
[02:38:57.200 --> 02:39:03.120]  you know i mean it's crazy what is going on here yeah you know michelle obama had a point
[02:39:03.120 --> 02:39:07.920]  she said that we have to watch out for nutrition in schools and we have something like 500 000
[02:39:07.920 --> 02:39:12.320]  people die of obesity every year i don't have a problem with you if you're fat some of my best
[02:39:12.320 --> 02:39:18.320]  friends are fat i'm fat uh but you you can't when right now we glorify it and we say it's healthy for
[02:39:18.320 --> 02:39:22.720]  you you're gonna be fine look at this hot bikini bod this woman has and you go look i'm not judging
[02:39:22.720 --> 02:39:29.120]  you lady but you're dying and this is what we keep doing we keep normalizing bad behavior or vices
[02:39:29.120 --> 02:39:32.960]  really and we do this with trends we go it's good that you're becoming a woman it's healthy
[02:39:32.960 --> 02:39:37.760]  that you're removing your penis and we're giving children hormone blockers because we're saying
[02:39:37.760 --> 02:39:41.520]  it's good that you think you're a woman and you're a man even though my issue is why do i have to
[02:39:41.520 --> 02:39:45.440]  pay for it i mean if anybody wants to cut their you know their wee wee off that's their issue but
[02:39:45.440 --> 02:39:50.400]  why am i paying for it and it's child abuse you give a kid hormone blockers at ten years old
[02:39:50.400 --> 02:39:54.880]  no i agree that's child abuse chemical and you're encouraging something that has a brutal suicide
[02:39:54.880 --> 02:40:00.320]  rate so we're now normalizing behavior that is so off the wall that it's dangerous and look at
[02:40:00.320 --> 02:40:06.160]  salon by the way it's like normalizing pedophilia and saying don't call them child molesters if they
[02:40:06.160 --> 02:40:12.480]  haven't molested children they're just pedophiles i noticed your for tv viewers can see it obviously
[02:40:12.480 --> 02:40:16.720]  radio listeners can't you're wearing a make america great again the classic red hat you've got a
[02:40:16.720 --> 02:40:20.560]  trump make america great again white shirt uh i guess you're the suburbs of new york you
[02:40:20.560 --> 02:40:25.120]  were describing to me during the break what it's like when you're on the train uh and people see
[02:40:25.120 --> 02:40:30.880]  this what do they do yeah it's a funny city to wear this shirt in because new york changes so fast
[02:40:30.880 --> 02:40:36.000]  and there's so many different like people think of new york as just the upper west side rich
[02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:39.600]  liberals who read the new york times and that's definitely a big contingent but there's the blue
[02:40:39.600 --> 02:40:44.480]  collars the retired cops there's cony island there's all the immigrants there's the yuppies
[02:40:44.480 --> 02:40:49.680]  there's the the rich girl blogger feminist with the blue hair so you get off of different stops on
[02:40:49.680 --> 02:40:54.160]  the subway and you're in different culture and i was in williamsburg today and manhattan and in
[02:40:54.160 --> 02:40:59.280]  williamsburg when the hipsters see the shirt they you think they go like screw you but there's an
[02:40:59.280 --> 02:41:04.400]  air of capitulation and they sort of just bow their heads i think deep down they want to be
[02:41:04.400 --> 02:41:09.600]  dominated by trump and they know that their version of events isn't better like they call it
[02:41:09.600 --> 02:41:13.520]  creative destruction but it's really just sabotage they want to wipe out traditionalism
[02:41:13.520 --> 02:41:17.360]  and then you go all right what do you got and they go i don't know you know they did that with
[02:41:17.360 --> 02:41:21.680]  gender they go male and female is too restrictive and you go okay what do you got and they give
[02:41:21.680 --> 02:41:26.240]  us four more and then they go is that it no and they keep giving us more and i realize
[02:41:26.240 --> 02:41:30.560]  you're like isis you're insatiable you don't know what you want you need i was about to say
[02:41:30.560 --> 02:41:35.120]  they want to blow up traditionalism western traditionalism is what is the fount of true
[02:41:35.120 --> 02:41:40.080]  liberalism and all the choices they're trying to blow up the source of all their damn freedom
[02:41:40.080 --> 02:41:44.640]  and you create a vacuum when you do that and you know who fills in the vacuum
[02:41:44.640 --> 02:41:50.720]  not progressives but isis but immigrants but sharia law as soon as you say marriage doesn't
[02:41:50.720 --> 02:41:55.920]  matter then someone else moves in who's a polygamist and says okay we're gonna do five
[02:41:55.920 --> 02:42:00.240]  muslim wives who have to wear garbage bags on their head i was about to say though why does
[02:42:00.240 --> 02:42:03.920]  the left we talk about this but but they they don't just go along with Islam they love it
[02:42:03.920 --> 02:42:08.720]  it's like they're somatic christians that don't want to bake a cake but then they totally want to
[02:42:08.720 --> 02:42:13.920]  flip out and just bow down and make excuses for the most radical foaming at the mouth cavemen
[02:42:13.920 --> 02:42:19.120]  islamist it's bizarre and i've spent hours trying to figure it out the only thing i can do is come
[02:42:19.120 --> 02:42:23.920]  out with some sort of Freudian theory about daddy issues where they go the enemy of my enemy is my
[02:42:23.920 --> 02:42:29.360]  friend i noticed that my dad's uncomfortable when i'm a lesbian when i'm not married my dad gets
[02:42:29.360 --> 02:42:34.640]  uncomfortable when i take how to be gay in college my dad gets uncomfortable when i support islam
[02:42:34.640 --> 02:42:39.840]  okay i like all those things and you're sitting there as a dad going you realize that most of
[02:42:39.840 --> 02:42:46.000]  those are not what's good for you and islam will wipe you out you liberals will be the first to go
[02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:51.040]  if we get sharia law in this country the white male patriarchy that they hate so much
[02:42:51.040 --> 02:42:57.200]  is the one that gives them the most freedom the most leeway so really it's a bunch of spoiled
[02:42:57.200 --> 02:43:02.000]  brats and then now they're just letting the robber in the front door even though the robber's
[02:43:02.000 --> 02:43:07.600]  gonna hog time and rape him exactly it's a real problem with this country and i'm an immigrant
[02:43:07.600 --> 02:43:12.560]  from canada and i'm very grateful to be here and one thing you notice ayan here see ali talks
[02:43:12.560 --> 02:43:16.560]  about this she goes these people have had nothing but freedom they don't know how lucky they are
[02:43:16.560 --> 02:43:21.120]  and as an entrepreneur from canada who had to be punished by the government every time i came up
[02:43:21.120 --> 02:43:26.880]  with an idea i am so thankful to be in a place where you can incorporate for a thousand bucks
[02:43:26.880 --> 02:43:31.440]  in delaware and start your business the next day these americans don't know how lucky they are and
[02:43:31.440 --> 02:43:35.120]  if one person i'm glad you brought up obama if there's one person who doesn't understand the
[02:43:35.120 --> 02:43:40.800]  entrepreneur it's barack obama i mean here's one tiny thing that is huge that no one gets
[02:43:40.800 --> 02:43:47.120]  at their own sort of business for every success i estimate you have 12 failures so when you go
[02:43:47.120 --> 02:43:52.480]  to a water park like great wolf lodge know that those brothers from madison wisconsin who started
[02:43:52.480 --> 02:43:57.120]  that had a dozen brutal failures where their wives were thinking of leaving them where they were
[02:43:57.120 --> 02:44:01.760]  overdrawn at the bank where they were looking forward into an abyss of bankruptcy they kept
[02:44:01.760 --> 02:44:06.320]  plugging away and they made it but someone like barack comes along who's never really done anything
[02:44:06.320 --> 02:44:11.280]  like that and he goes well you someone just gave you a water park you used by roads to get to your
[02:44:11.280 --> 02:44:18.000]  water park so you only have even though it was the people's mind to build the roads to begin with
[02:44:18.960 --> 02:44:24.240]  yes and you better not say that in new york because when i go upstate i pay at least 40
[02:44:24.240 --> 02:44:30.320]  dollars in tolls coming back and forth so the roads here are not free and we still have to struggle
[02:44:30.320 --> 02:44:35.760]  to get our taxes below 50 percent i mean it's new york is communist in a lot of ways and these
[02:44:35.760 --> 02:44:42.560]  ingrates think it should be more these these anarchist punks who hate rules want more regular
[02:44:42.560 --> 02:44:47.600]  i was about to say everything's upside down all the anarchists i see have mausetong or linen
[02:44:47.600 --> 02:44:53.360]  or stalling tattoos they have red flags they pull up in like brand new sports cars and then and
[02:44:53.360 --> 02:44:57.680]  then they're calling themselves anarchists they're the opposite of anarchists they're a status little
[02:44:57.680 --> 02:45:02.880]  pick and it's frustrating like at least with slavery you go all right blacks would be the
[02:45:02.880 --> 02:45:06.400]  first to go and there's an argument that they wouldn't be and maybe you'd need the i don't
[02:45:06.400 --> 02:45:12.640]  know if you need the labor but with these artistic creative types and mal you go i don't have to
[02:45:12.640 --> 02:45:19.360]  conjecture that you'd be the first to go i saw he killed 77 million the creative types were at
[02:45:19.360 --> 02:45:25.280]  the top of the list so you're wishing your own suicide it really is a form of self-hate no no
[02:45:25.280 --> 02:45:31.520]  i agree it's mass Stockholm syndrome uh unconscious suicide because no one beat the hell out of
[02:45:31.520 --> 02:45:34.560]  them when they were a kid i'm not saying it's great to be like that but you know most of us
[02:45:34.560 --> 02:45:38.480]  growing up at least we had some rough times had to get a job i mean the best thing ever happened
[02:45:38.480 --> 02:45:42.320]  was rough stuff and i think it's that they've never had legitimate suffering they don't know
[02:45:42.320 --> 02:45:46.640]  how good they've got it so subconsciously they're trying to commit suicide but take us with them
[02:45:46.640 --> 02:45:51.200]  good degree more and you can tell when someone's never been punched in the face you can tell by
[02:45:51.200 --> 02:45:56.160]  the way they talk that they've never ever had a moment where they go oh wow there's ramifications
[02:45:56.160 --> 02:46:01.520]  for stuff i say and another factor by the way outside of the awesome bullying that we all went
[02:46:01.520 --> 02:46:06.640]  through that was ultimately great for us is kids you know you got someone like Angela Merkel
[02:46:06.640 --> 02:46:13.760]  she doesn't have kids she is purposely sabotaging her country her culture it's really like a mass
[02:46:13.760 --> 02:46:20.000]  shooting she's sort of i know i'm gonna die i'm gonna take as many germans down with me as i can
[02:46:21.840 --> 02:46:25.680]  what do you think's behind the five million they brought in there they tried to cover it up what
[02:46:25.680 --> 02:46:30.880]  they're doing here daily stabbings murders bombings and then the guys named ollie they
[02:46:30.880 --> 02:46:35.840]  changed the name to david i mean this is beyond 1984 i mean i i don't know how they created
[02:46:35.840 --> 02:46:41.840]  such a freakazoid cult well here's what's going on here they see themselves as superior to the
[02:46:41.840 --> 02:46:46.560]  masses the dirty unwashed masses because they're communists and communists ultimately are like
[02:46:46.560 --> 02:46:51.920]  monarchs they have a hierarchy in their mind and they will control the good like obama and he will
[02:46:51.920 --> 02:46:57.120]  dole out the good as he sees fit to those who deserve it because we're too stupid to handle it
[02:46:57.120 --> 02:47:02.800]  alexand gavin they would just sort of feed their faces and then buy ferraris and crash them into a
[02:47:03.680 --> 02:47:09.920]  fence post so they go here i'm gonna dole it out evenly and what the the media is also like that
[02:47:09.920 --> 02:47:15.600]  angela merkel and the german press and the french politicians and the french press they all say i'm
[02:47:15.600 --> 02:47:20.000]  not going to report this too accurately because i don't want to start a race war and i don't want
[02:47:20.000 --> 02:47:24.800]  there to be too much animosity and you go wait a minute i thought your job was reporting on things
[02:47:24.800 --> 02:47:31.360]  no no no my job is slowly doling out the information and deciding what you are capable of and then we
[02:47:31.360 --> 02:47:38.080]  find out what was this a couple weeks ago that at vada clan they were castrating victims taking
[02:47:38.080 --> 02:47:43.840]  out their testicles and putting it into these guys mouths that's liberal as they die and the press
[02:47:43.840 --> 02:47:48.480]  and the government cut that detail out because we're too stupid to handle it we would get too
[02:47:48.480 --> 02:47:54.480]  mad and we're too irrational so just like all political correctness is someone telling me what
[02:47:54.480 --> 02:47:59.600]  words to use for black and it's african-american this year and it's personal color it's basically
[02:47:59.600 --> 02:48:05.600]  these victorians right these modern victorians it's all to make you feel insecure you can never
[02:48:05.600 --> 02:48:11.760]  reach the level the benchmark we're just all guilty yes and the irony is they're telling us
[02:48:11.760 --> 02:48:15.760]  about things that they've never tried that we live in and that's why i love that you didn't
[02:48:15.760 --> 02:48:20.720]  build that i can't recommend this book enough michelle malcon who built that where she's pretty
[02:48:20.720 --> 02:48:25.200]  apolitical about it and she just goes through the guys who invented air conditioning the guy
[02:48:25.200 --> 02:48:30.480]  maglite flashlight the roblings who built the the steel bridges all these great stories of
[02:48:30.480 --> 02:48:35.520]  entrepreneurs and you just think i wish i could force obama and all these communists to read this
[02:48:35.520 --> 02:48:39.600]  because when you read about entrepreneurs the people who built the western world you don't see
[02:48:39.600 --> 02:48:46.480]  these greedy you know rappers on jet skis you see guys working their fingers to the bone for the
[02:48:46.480 --> 02:48:50.960]  betterment of society in general i mean look at air conditioning alone because there's an
[02:48:50.960 --> 02:48:55.760]  instinctive need to build things and innovate in the highest levels of the human spirit of
[02:48:55.760 --> 02:49:00.400]  transcending things and and gabham again this is our guest you're absolutely right you look at communist
[02:49:00.400 --> 02:49:05.040]  countries they can't even ever make cars they have to buy their ships and tank factories from
[02:49:05.040 --> 02:49:09.840]  somebody else i mean look look look at north korea look how south koreans are even beating out the
[02:49:09.840 --> 02:49:14.160]  japanese as innovators now the north can't make a car look at the russian some of the best map
[02:49:14.160 --> 02:49:18.960]  petitions and engineers in the world under communism they could hardly make cars i mean it's so obvious
[02:49:18.960 --> 02:49:24.720]  that the claim that the state creates stuff is pure baloney i know it goes i keep going back to
[02:49:24.720 --> 02:49:29.120]  evolution which ultimately is code for god i don't like to say god around atheists because
[02:49:29.120 --> 02:49:34.320]  they shut their ear holes but isn't it curious that when we go against evolution and we say
[02:49:34.320 --> 02:49:40.720]  actually i'm going to go against this this 250 000 year old pattern of hunting a woolly mammoth
[02:49:40.720 --> 02:49:45.040]  throwing a spear getting a woolly mammoth and just start doling out woolly mammoths to people
[02:49:45.040 --> 02:49:49.600]  and see how it goes what you're doing there is you're playing god and when you play god you're
[02:49:49.600 --> 02:49:53.680]  messing with his formula and it ultimately blows up in your head that's right the animating contest
[02:49:53.680 --> 02:49:58.960]  of running them down running them over the side of a cliff uh and then cutting it up and processing
[02:49:58.960 --> 02:50:05.360]  it for the winter or you die it it's not work it creates a culture instead imagine just people
[02:50:05.360 --> 02:50:10.320]  sitting around with woolly mammoth meat being dropped by helicopters we wouldn't be here austerity
[02:50:10.320 --> 02:50:14.880]  works and that's why you see so much innovation and i'm sorry but if you're near the equator you're
[02:50:14.880 --> 02:50:19.920]  not under duress if you don't have severe winters in your history you tend not to be as tenacious
[02:50:19.920 --> 02:50:24.880]  because the non tenacious died and i remember i can't remember who was it that's been sent a fox
[02:50:24.880 --> 02:50:28.960]  when he was president of mexico they said what have you come up with what have you invented and he
[02:50:28.960 --> 02:50:33.600]  talked about the aztecs and and like my calendar and all this stuff and they said no no let's do
[02:50:33.600 --> 02:50:41.760]  the past hundred years and he goes uh the taco that it's not even that handy of a food really
[02:50:41.760 --> 02:50:46.240]  it's got nothing on it wait a minute don't bash mexican food it has it has innovated quite a bit
[02:50:46.240 --> 02:50:53.520]  eat it at an angle and then it's falling out the side it's innovated my belt size hey stay there
[02:50:53.520 --> 02:50:59.040]  you have him again it is true in studies at ice age civilizations whether it be japan or europe
[02:50:59.040 --> 02:51:03.920]  whatever i had to have to innovate i think the recession really over is a bigger one on the way
[02:51:03.920 --> 02:51:09.680]  will our next president lead us to prosperity and peace or will it all fall apart our modern
[02:51:09.680 --> 02:51:14.960]  world is unpredictable and unstable are you ready for what comes next what if the worst happens

[02:53:15.360 --> 02:53:20.080]  lifesaving electrical power and unlike gas generators solar generators run silently
[02:53:20.080 --> 02:53:25.200]  emit no fumes or gases and produce electricity from the sun whether it's dangerous summer storms
[02:53:25.200 --> 02:53:30.080]  blackouts intensifying civil unrest you're not going to have to suffer through it like the rest
[02:53:30.080 --> 02:53:34.560]  of the sheep and here's the best news if you want to get one this week solutions from science has a

[02:54:09.280 --> 02:54:10.800]  riders on the storm
[02:54:10.800 --> 02:54:25.680]  now to be fair to mesoamerican culture they were big on tracking the stars and mathematics and
[02:54:25.680 --> 02:54:29.680]  things like that but um but like other cultures doesn't matter whether it was a northern culture
[02:54:29.680 --> 02:54:34.800]  or or equatorial culture they would get into the occult into cultures of government control
[02:54:35.520 --> 02:54:40.640]  as soon as populations became agrarian that was actually too much food is what gatham was
[02:54:40.640 --> 02:54:45.920]  getting at and so the decadence would set in in a ruling class could hold back the food
[02:54:45.920 --> 02:54:51.600]  that they had everybody else basically planned and so a form of caste slavery came in and caste
[02:54:51.600 --> 02:54:57.520]  slavery didn't do too well in northern frozen clines and a lot of sociologists anthropologists
[02:54:57.520 --> 02:55:02.400]  archaeologists have pointed this out so that's why you see a lot of innovations going on in more
[02:55:02.400 --> 02:55:07.360]  inhospitable places because that which doesn't kill you only makes you stronger and it's actually
[02:55:07.360 --> 02:55:14.800]  the plenty uh nothing to do with iqs it's just the plenty creates a decadence and now look at us
[02:55:14.800 --> 02:55:21.440]  today no matter what color we are we are dying because we have just just been put in an artifact
[02:55:21.440 --> 02:55:25.600]  it's kind of going to mars you get there in a year and a half you can't walk when you get off the
[02:55:25.600 --> 02:55:30.080]  spaceship because there's been no gravity i mean is that what you're getting at gavin yeah that is
[02:55:30.080 --> 02:55:34.640]  exactly what i'm getting at it it often feels like we're in the future look at how many different
[02:55:34.640 --> 02:55:40.640]  programs we do to try to go backwards in time and mimic a better work ethic or a more traditional
[02:55:40.640 --> 02:55:46.640]  society like like going to the gym i mean we used to be on the farm every day you'd work 11 hours
[02:55:46.640 --> 02:55:51.520]  chilling the land and you'd come home exhausted and just have a meal and crash now we're not
[02:55:51.520 --> 02:55:56.640]  exercising enough so we go out i mean we run on a treadmill i mean if people could see us walking
[02:55:56.640 --> 02:56:01.760]  up and down these these computer stairs these fake stairs and walking on treadmills they'd be
[02:56:01.760 --> 02:56:06.720]  stunned and then i was about to say they've dug up people from 10 000 years ago in england
[02:56:06.720 --> 02:56:11.040]  and the average person was like stronger than Arnold Schwarzenegger or an olympic lifter i
[02:56:11.040 --> 02:56:17.680]  mean i mean these people would rip your arm out of your socket yeah you had to and i keep talking
[02:56:17.680 --> 02:56:21.440]  to people and they go you know like i was talking to comedian the other day he goes i'm really getting
[02:56:21.440 --> 02:56:25.600]  into buddhism i'm getting into meditation because i get too stressed out and i realized
[02:56:26.240 --> 02:56:29.920]  you're an atheist you threw catholicism away even though you broke like that what you're talking
[02:56:29.920 --> 02:56:36.560]  about is latin mass or they go to rehab that's 40 days that's lent so i think we're in the future
[02:56:36.560 --> 02:56:42.720]  in many ways it's a lot like walley where we've had so much slender and so many gifts that we
[02:56:42.720 --> 02:56:48.480]  we almost have to reinforce discipline and and make ourselves suffer i agree with you
[02:56:49.120 --> 02:56:53.760]  so so how do we do that gavin well we try to improve ourselves here here's the thing like i
[02:56:55.040 --> 02:56:59.200]  this conversation tends to drift into race and i never wanted it to go there it's when these
[02:56:59.200 --> 02:57:04.240]  lefties go well that's racist and that's white male and then we go oh really i never really checked
[02:57:04.240 --> 02:57:07.840]  and then you look around you go oh yeah i guess there are some white males there but that's not
[02:57:07.840 --> 02:57:12.080]  where we go we're western chauvinists and i started this group called the proud boys
[02:57:12.080 --> 02:57:16.480]  we have meetings every month we beat the crap out of each other until we can name five breakfast
[02:57:16.480 --> 02:57:23.520]  cereals we all have tattoos that say proud boy and uh we are proud of our testosterone and our
[02:57:23.520 --> 02:57:29.680]  masculinity and we're noticing that these women appreciate it too we need to get back to this
[02:57:29.680 --> 02:57:34.800]  this concept that met the patriarchy is not the worst thing that's happened to civilization it
[02:57:34.800 --> 02:57:40.800]  is civilization and if you ever better patriarchy is having a brother that if somebody attacks you
[02:57:40.800 --> 02:57:44.240]  no matter how old you are your brother's gonna come kill them instead women are just all alone
[02:57:44.240 --> 02:57:49.840]  to have punk men beat them up and you see this living in the city living in new york city for 15
[02:57:49.840 --> 02:57:54.560]  years you know someone has a sip of a drink richard swartz by the way who's working on
[02:57:54.560 --> 02:57:57.840]  trump's campaign was telling me this the other day he goes i'm walking up the stairs in the subway
[02:57:57.840 --> 02:58:02.800]  and i see a big gulp that's just sitting on the stairs and he goes can you imagine yourself
[02:58:02.800 --> 02:58:06.800]  having a big gulp and going all right i'm done with this and just putting it down on public
[02:58:06.800 --> 02:58:12.400]  stairs and walking away it's a mentality that means i don't like you and i think a big part
[02:58:12.400 --> 02:58:17.920]  of this mentality is sort of disconnect that's right it's a religion of crapping all over everyone
[02:58:17.920 --> 02:58:23.200]  and not caring about anybody but yourself it's like crapping in the pool i mean they actually
[02:58:23.200 --> 02:58:26.720]  have the islamist coming crapping the pool it's like look when you crap in the pool it ruins it
[02:58:26.720 --> 02:58:31.120]  for everyone dummy but they're getting off on that moment crapping in the pool even though it's
[02:58:31.120 --> 02:58:35.360]  going to close it for the next two days and so it's those of us that don't want to crap in the pool
[02:58:35.360 --> 02:58:39.440]  versus people don't want to crap in the pool we're back in 70 seconds with hour number four

[02:58:53.440 --> 02:58:58.080]  research into what has been called the iodine conspiracy i've told you about how scientists
[02:58:58.080 --> 02:59:03.680]  have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate iq and how the government knowingly
[02:59:03.680 --> 02:59:08.960]  started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride the bad member of the halogen family into
[02:59:08.960 --> 02:59:14.640]  the water they took the good halogen and put the deadly halogen in and when the fukushima crisis
[02:59:14.640 --> 02:59:19.520]  worsened as it still is worsening today i was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your
[02:59:19.520 --> 02:59:26.560]  family now in 2016 even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine
[02:59:26.560 --> 02:59:32.480]  and the gut which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning
[02:59:32.480 --> 02:59:37.200]  iodine you can pull these studies up for yourself this is the real deal folks and the truth is that

[03:01:05.920 --> 03:01:09.840]  do you think humanity is on the march because i do think we're kind of rediscovering our roots
[03:01:09.840 --> 03:01:16.400]  or am i being too optimistic i think a great way to gauge that is you you know the canary in a coal
[03:01:16.400 --> 03:01:22.560]  mine i remember five ten years ago alex jones was this crazy guy who was always fighting the
[03:01:22.560 --> 03:01:26.720]  government and that's nuts because the government's right most of the time so he's out of his mind
[03:01:26.720 --> 03:01:33.520]  and he probably believes people are reptiles today info wars is like right far people don't say
[03:01:33.520 --> 03:01:39.040]  that's well a few crazy liberals do but most saying people go yeah info wars is saying
[03:01:40.160 --> 03:01:46.480]  right part is saying it's just a very reliable news source and it turns out that this so-called
[03:01:46.480 --> 03:01:52.240]  nut was right and you see this with lots of people jim goad used to be considered a total freak now
[03:01:52.240 --> 03:01:59.040]  he's a wise old sage steve sailor peter brimmo jared taylor be there uh all of these sites the
[03:01:59.040 --> 03:02:04.560]  american enterprise and look at charles murray charles murray wrote coming apart where he said
[03:02:04.560 --> 03:02:09.200]  we are out of touch with the working class and we're building this ivory tower of academics and
[03:02:09.200 --> 03:02:14.480]  media pundits and politicians who don't know what average people go through and it's it's almost
[03:02:14.480 --> 03:02:19.760]  like nostradamus like it couldn't have become more true and now the social justice warriors
[03:02:19.760 --> 03:02:25.120]  who seem like freedom riders 10 years ago are now the laughing stock everyone sees them as the church
[03:02:25.120 --> 03:02:29.680]  agree so as bad as it is it's a paradox i mean i mean they are a laughing stock now and seriously
[03:02:29.680 --> 03:02:32.880]  what they do to me is every day i'm not exaggerating but let's not exaggerate
[03:02:32.880 --> 03:02:38.480]  50 times a day i mean so many i can't they go alex jones believes in space aliens and lizard people
[03:02:38.480 --> 03:02:42.480]  and i say i'm sure there's life in space i don't know what's going on but i don't believe all that
[03:02:42.480 --> 03:02:47.360]  they misrepresent or they say that i believe in bigfoot never talked about bigfoot so they can't
[03:02:47.360 --> 03:02:52.400]  beat what we're saying they just meant or they say he doesn't like black people when the hell did i
[03:02:52.400 --> 03:02:57.360]  say that they just make stuff up they just make it up well that's the beauty of the information age
[03:02:57.360 --> 03:03:02.000]  because they go really he hates black people and then all it takes is one person to go look it up and
[03:03:02.000 --> 03:03:06.480]  go actually he never said that and it's just such a great defense in the information age because
[03:03:06.480 --> 03:03:11.760]  someone could just grab their phone and go yeah he never said that like oh trump said that every
[03:03:11.760 --> 03:03:18.400]  all mexicans and muslims have to be deported show me where he said that find me that sentence
[03:03:18.400 --> 03:03:21.200]  there was another one they even have the fake right wing attack me they go alex jones has
[03:03:21.200 --> 03:03:25.040]  attacked street preachers and i wasn't even my person it was interviewing somebody they say
[03:03:25.040 --> 03:03:29.520]  these people discredit christians screaming in everyone's face i think they have a first amendment
[03:03:29.520 --> 03:03:33.520]  sometimes i think they're obnoxious but the point is i never said that so the new thing is to attack
[03:03:33.520 --> 03:03:38.000]  me from the control right and say that i'm attacking street preachers just made up but you know what
[03:03:38.000 --> 03:03:42.400]  i think that's the last gas for the mainstream media they have to lie about everything it's the
[03:03:42.400 --> 03:03:46.880]  death now and they have all these little things that are indications that they're a dying animal
[03:03:46.880 --> 03:03:52.000]  they sound like roadkill just having their last gas and my favorite one is look i know political
[03:03:52.000 --> 03:03:57.280]  correctness has gotten out of hand with something but last time i checked it was just people treating
[03:03:57.280 --> 03:04:02.720]  other people with respect i've heard that sentence a hundred times and it really is just sort of
[03:04:02.720 --> 03:04:13.440]  so what replaces it though freedom liberty free speech i mean the government is actually
[03:04:13.440 --> 03:04:19.280]  not bad when it comes to free speech it's the people we are more orwellian to each other
[03:04:19.280 --> 03:04:24.080]  than the government is the government won't get you fired for making a speech but your
[03:04:24.080 --> 03:04:29.920]  co-workers will cause a big stink twitter will get you fired the those contact your boss will be a
[03:04:29.920 --> 03:04:35.840]  boycott that's right it's a modern witch hunt it's a modern witch hunt or me it's a modern witch hunt
[03:04:36.800 --> 03:04:40.560]  it's Salem all over again and the thing that tries to be nuts is stay with Salem right
[03:04:40.560 --> 03:04:46.080]  and your husband gets picked up for wearing black your wife should go what the hell is going on here
[03:04:46.080 --> 03:04:51.040]  people can't wear black but in this culture now your wife would go why were you wearing black
[03:04:51.040 --> 03:04:55.120]  you know it's Salem you know it's the witch hunt so you go hold on stay there you're gonna take
[03:04:55.120 --> 03:05:00.480]  cover finish up with Salem straight ahead Gavin McGinnis is our guest good shardy so what do we
[03:05:00.480 --> 03:05:05.040]  know about kazeer khan that muslim gold star father the democrats have rolled out to try and
[03:05:05.040 --> 03:05:09.920]  stump trump well as bright part news and others have reported his now deleted website proves that
[03:05:09.920 --> 03:05:15.520]  he financially benefits from unfettered pay-to-play muslim migration into america but remember when
[03:05:15.520 --> 03:05:20.960]  he whipped out his pocket constitution well it turns out that khan has actually published papers
[03:05:20.960 --> 03:05:26.480]  supporting the supremacy of islamic law over man-made western law bright but reports that in
[03:05:26.480 --> 03:05:32.800]  1983 for example khan wrote a glowing review of a book human rights in islam khan speaks
[03:05:32.800 --> 03:05:37.600]  admiringly of the interpretation of human rights in the book even though it includes the right to
[03:05:37.600 --> 03:05:43.360]  kill and mutilate those who violate islamic laws and even the right of men to beat wives who act
[03:05:43.360 --> 03:05:49.760]  unseemly and in a separate academic paper juristic classification of islamic law khan argues that all
[03:05:49.760 --> 03:05:55.200]  other judicial works must always be subordinated to the sharia so just because he's read his pocket
[03:05:55.200 --> 03:06:00.560]  constitution doesn't mean he agrees with it leon macadoo for info wars dot com hey everyone

[03:08:47.360 --> 03:08:53.600]  a lot of interesting things political correctness this story here also cnn i just grabbed it printed
[03:08:53.600 --> 03:09:02.240]  before the show cnn show trashes trump 200 times more than covering obama's 400 million dollar iran
[03:09:02.240 --> 03:09:08.480]  payment so even if you don't like trump it doesn't even matter they won't even talk about the real
[03:09:08.480 --> 03:09:13.760]  things anymore because they're too busy trashing trump all they care about now is trashing trump
[03:09:13.760 --> 03:09:20.720]  and how mean he is and whether malania was in some photos in a magazine or whatever oh my word
[03:09:20.720 --> 03:09:24.000]  right they're just constantly getting triggered i guess we're going to talk about political
[03:09:24.000 --> 03:09:27.920]  correctness we're going to talk about the burkini only day at french water parks we're going to
[03:09:27.920 --> 03:09:33.840]  talk about real olympics politically incorrect to criticize that uh chinese hurdler vomondon
[03:09:33.840 --> 03:09:41.120]  and robbed on of luggage uh danish olympic team hit by thieves they uh couldn't get in the gate
[03:09:41.120 --> 03:09:48.240]  of their own event the officials lots and lots of stuff but gavin mcinnis from compoundmedia.com
[03:09:48.240 --> 03:09:57.600]  his twitter is at gavin underscore mcinnis mci nnes he's an entrepreneur comedian he's just
[03:09:57.600 --> 03:10:01.920]  very very all around interesting guy with a lot of good points so gavin glad to have you back
[03:10:02.640 --> 03:10:09.120]  uh segment with alex for sure so first and foremost let's hit this right away all the
[03:10:09.120 --> 03:10:13.440]  articles i have before me a lot of them are about political correctness right it's about like
[03:10:13.440 --> 03:10:20.000]  people getting so upset and so offended and i believe that at the end of the day it's all
[03:10:20.000 --> 03:10:25.280]  a bunch of bs and it reminds me of how the washington post found that nine out of ten
[03:10:25.280 --> 03:10:30.160]  native americans weren't offended by the redskins name and if you remember they were like oh the
[03:10:30.160 --> 03:10:35.520]  redskins that's such a racist offensive name to name americans and it was all the white people
[03:10:35.520 --> 03:10:40.080]  and other whatever in the media saying how offended the native americans are they're not even offended
[03:10:40.080 --> 03:10:44.240]  at all i mean do you think the majority of people are really just saying this is totally absurd or
[03:10:44.240 --> 03:10:50.560]  what yeah i'm married to an indian i made a bunch of indians and i remember reading in early 2000
[03:10:51.200 --> 03:10:58.080]  that the number was about four percent for them caring and then it became the thing to do and we
[03:10:58.080 --> 03:11:03.280]  have the president saying i would change the name if i were you then it went up really high and i
[03:11:03.280 --> 03:11:08.160]  could tell it was fake see that's what happens with these things when you lay out the red carpet of
[03:11:08.160 --> 03:11:15.760]  griping a lot of people go yeah i'm gonna take it and they jump on board and so indians did care
[03:11:15.760 --> 03:11:21.040]  for about a year when it was the hot thing and then it went back to the normal number which is zero
[03:11:21.040 --> 03:11:27.920]  indians name their own teams redskins and you know here's what's funny too we're gonna talk about
[03:11:27.920 --> 03:11:31.200]  you know what you learned through being an entrepreneur and actually gaining gratitude
[03:11:31.200 --> 03:11:38.640]  and appreciating things but i've got a story here about the first modern man from 3200 bc
[03:11:38.640 --> 03:11:43.040]  in national geographic and you think about his problems we won't get too much into it they
[03:11:43.040 --> 03:11:47.680]  identified this person who is the first modern man with a name so like the first story what he did
[03:11:47.680 --> 03:11:54.800]  and everything you think about his problems right maybe not dying of starvation maybe not dying in
[03:11:54.800 --> 03:12:00.880]  a tribal attack right maybe not getting a spear through his gut feeding his family whatever think
[03:12:00.880 --> 03:12:06.720]  about his problems and now think about the modern day problems we've condensed them into instead of
[03:12:06.720 --> 03:12:11.520]  the real things that are our issues into getting triggered on twitter right so you think about
[03:12:11.520 --> 03:12:17.120]  thousands of years ago we were so upset about tribes coming in and killing our families not
[03:12:17.120 --> 03:12:21.760]  getting enough food and now we're just as upset about politically incorrect statements on twitter
[03:12:21.760 --> 03:12:28.080]  and facebook i mean what do you think about that our problems now are absurd well it's amazing i saw
[03:12:28.080 --> 03:12:33.280]  this thing the new york times put together and it was all these horrible discoveries they've made
[03:12:33.280 --> 03:12:40.320]  while embedded in the trump uh followers movement whatever you want to call it for a year and they
[03:12:40.320 --> 03:12:47.520]  got one n word and one z kyle over a year of camping out with these guys and before they aired
[03:12:47.520 --> 03:12:53.280]  the segment they said warning um some dangerous content may offend some viewers and i saw imagine
[03:12:53.280 --> 03:13:00.400]  being 89 92 years old or something having been in world war two and seeing someone need a warning
[03:13:00.400 --> 03:13:07.120]  on their screen before they look at a year of trump protesters i you actually think about it
[03:13:07.120 --> 03:13:12.960]  yeah there it is that's exactly what i'm talking about no yeah go ahead that's exactly what i'm
[03:13:12.960 --> 03:13:19.680]  talking about it starts out with a huge warning before they just show you some of the most benign
[03:13:19.680 --> 03:13:25.120]  stuff you've ever seen and you think you don't have to go back to cave exactly hey we are we are
[03:13:25.120 --> 03:13:30.400]  losing your skype feed a little bit there but we were playing on uh screen there so it's warning
[03:13:30.400 --> 03:13:35.840]  we lost mechanism right now we'll get them back on as soon as we can but it's like warning oh this
[03:13:35.840 --> 03:13:42.400]  could be offensive just watching trump protesters how about watching just watching the protesters
[03:13:42.400 --> 03:13:47.840]  that we have on the alex jones channel things they say right i mean god they if you even ask someone
[03:13:47.840 --> 03:13:50.960]  a question they start cursing you out looks like we got mckinnis back but what do you think about
[03:13:50.960 --> 03:13:56.480]  that when you ask these people questions now they start screaming at you and cursing at you like any
[03:13:56.480 --> 03:14:05.680]  question at all yeah i know why that is because they spent 200 000 on this marxist marxist rhetoric
[03:14:05.680 --> 03:14:11.840]  and when you question it they realize what a house of cards their entire foundation is their entire
[03:14:11.840 --> 03:14:18.800]  ideology and it becomes a crippling aware an awakening where they go oh my god i don't really
[03:14:18.800 --> 03:14:23.120]  know anything and so they panic and they start screaming and you see this a protest they'll use
[03:14:23.120 --> 03:14:30.640]  like an air horn in your face when you try to talk or they use bull horns or they spit in your face
[03:14:30.640 --> 03:14:35.200]  they spit in your face and i try to get these people on my show all the time to debate them even
[03:14:35.200 --> 03:14:39.360]  though it gets real boring because they haven't looked up anything but they don't want to debate
[03:14:39.360 --> 03:14:44.160]  because they're not in it for truth they're in it for the culture that's a sports team to them
[03:14:45.440 --> 03:14:49.760]  and you know it's it's funny so as an entrepreneur yourself right you touched on
[03:14:49.760 --> 03:14:53.920]  early in the segment i thought you made an interesting point i'm an entrepreneur too
[03:14:53.920 --> 03:14:56.960]  and and it's anyone though it's not just entrepreneurship anyone that's worked hard
[03:14:56.960 --> 03:15:01.200]  to get where they are anyone that has drive anyone that has passion for something they also
[03:15:01.200 --> 03:15:04.960]  understand gratitude right like when you appreciate nothing you learn to appreciate when you have
[03:15:04.960 --> 03:15:09.920]  nothing you learn to appreciate everything and but what we have now is people that work for nothing
[03:15:09.920 --> 03:15:14.720]  refuse to do anything and appreciate nothing so they don't understand the gravity of the situation
[03:15:14.720 --> 03:15:20.480]  like you were saying the innovators throughout time uh the people that built not only cities
[03:15:20.480 --> 03:15:25.440]  countries uh culture everything spent blood you think about all the people that fought and died
[03:15:25.440 --> 03:15:30.240]  for all this and not in like a hurrah way like oh america i'm talking about real innovators from
[03:15:30.240 --> 03:15:34.560]  wherever that did all these things and built everything and then you basically have these
[03:15:34.560 --> 03:15:39.360]  people that come in that have never been told never done anything they bought into the system lie
[03:15:39.360 --> 03:15:43.440]  the establishment lie which you were alluding to earlier you know they've been told yeah just study
[03:15:43.440 --> 03:15:48.800]  hard and go to school and you'll be fine and by the way this is everyone too talk to lebron jane
[03:15:48.800 --> 03:15:53.840]  it's all about failure any professional athlete any entrepreneur any rich person
[03:15:53.840 --> 03:15:59.840]  the the plus side which is what you see is a tiny fraction of his culture his culture is
[03:15:59.840 --> 03:16:04.880]  failure it's failing again and again and again and getting back up it's the same with getting
[03:16:04.880 --> 03:16:09.600]  laid actually anyway any guy's got a hot girlfriend hit on a lot of other girls and he got turned
[03:16:09.600 --> 03:16:14.240]  down a lot of other times but that's what i love about this book i was plugging earlier
[03:16:14.240 --> 03:16:19.920]  because uh alex started the whole thing talking about you didn't build that and brock's attitude
[03:16:19.920 --> 03:16:24.240]  the roblings who built the brooklyn bridge have a fascinating path that goes back to
[03:16:24.240 --> 03:16:29.440]  hand-making rope which everyone everyone used to do you'd sit there and you twine it all it took
[03:16:29.440 --> 03:16:36.800]  hours and hours and dozens of people and then they got into using wires to do that and john roebling
[03:16:36.800 --> 03:16:41.040]  i can't remember which roebling it was but the the guy who started the brooklyn bridge lost his foot
[03:16:41.040 --> 03:16:46.880]  he crushed his foot while he was building that thing he watched it from a giant clock tower nearby
[03:16:46.880 --> 03:16:52.320]  as his son and his wife completed the project i mean these guys were not world war two vets but
[03:16:52.320 --> 03:16:58.320]  even these entrepreneurs lost lives making our lives better i mean manhattan would be nothing
[03:16:58.320 --> 03:17:03.200]  without the brooklyn bridge it is amazing and you think about also you see the photos of the
[03:17:03.200 --> 03:17:08.880]  the construction workers just working there's just a massive amount of risk they could fall down
[03:17:08.880 --> 03:17:12.560]  people were falling down all the time they didn't care they were building something they believed
[03:17:12.560 --> 03:17:15.840]  in they were doing what they believed in and they weren't even it's not like they were making that
[03:17:15.840 --> 03:17:22.000]  much money at the time right so these were people who died there was dozens of men who died just doing
[03:17:22.000 --> 03:17:26.320]  the groundwork for the bridge because they didn't know what the bends were they were dying as they
[03:17:26.320 --> 03:17:33.120]  came up from working on the rocks down under the water and look we're not asking by the way for a
[03:17:33.120 --> 03:17:37.760]  parade for these people we don't want giant memorials but when you start crapping on the people who
[03:17:37.760 --> 03:17:42.640]  built civilization and you start talking about the patriarchy and you start scoffing a tradition and
[03:17:42.640 --> 03:17:47.120]  telling dads they're horrible people and everyone is a rapist and stuff you go you know what i didn't
[03:17:47.120 --> 03:17:52.560]  ask you to get a tattoo of me but uh this whole like i'm responsible for everything gets a little
[03:17:52.560 --> 03:17:57.280]  annoying after a while you know that's what's funny too is no one's sitting here saying you know
[03:17:57.280 --> 03:18:03.120]  these people should be worshiped i'm gonna call it it's just the blatant disregard for every single
[03:18:03.120 --> 03:18:09.040]  thing we've been actually built that we can enjoy now it's almost like everything obama's saying is
[03:18:09.040 --> 03:18:12.720]  just a really really terrible version of what we're saying you see what i'm saying in in sense
[03:18:12.720 --> 03:18:16.080]  that we should appreciate these things we should continue to build things he's saying you didn't
[03:18:16.080 --> 03:18:21.280]  do anything no you know everyone gave you everything those people are bad it's a complete
[03:18:21.280 --> 03:18:26.880]  disgrace it's absurd and you also think about what we have to what we had to endure with coal miners
[03:18:26.880 --> 03:18:31.920]  getting black lung dying uh the breaker boys they would sort cold their hands would get all bloody
[03:18:31.920 --> 03:18:36.400]  down to the bone they would die a black lung all those people did that so we could get to this point
[03:18:36.400 --> 03:18:41.760]  and not so we could crap all everything everything like you just said and people just want the ultimate
[03:18:41.760 --> 03:18:46.480]  the uh the like you said finding an attractive girl right they just want the hot girl they just
[03:18:46.480 --> 03:18:50.000]  want the money they just want the success they don't want to do any of the failure they don't
[03:18:50.000 --> 03:18:54.160]  want to go through any of the process they want instant gratification right now and that is when
[03:18:54.160 --> 03:18:58.480]  we get to the point where someone's triggered by a twitter post because they're upset and they
[03:18:58.480 --> 03:19:04.880]  demand the police arrest somebody do you have kids i do not have kids how old are you how old
[03:19:04.880 --> 03:19:12.400]  do you think i'm in my 20s okay well it's time to shape up so i know i'm telling all these men
[03:19:12.400 --> 03:19:17.120]  who all these people who worked hard to build bridges and air conditioning and flashlights
[03:19:17.120 --> 03:19:23.840]  they also survived the bubonic plague and world wars and different conquests so you could get to
[03:19:23.840 --> 03:19:28.480]  that desk now i assume you're with an attractive lady if it's been more than six months and you
[03:19:28.480 --> 03:19:33.440]  guys are living together and you haven't had a drop-down drag out fight put a ring on it get a
[03:19:33.440 --> 03:19:38.240]  ring on it knock her up and make some more use that's some good advice right there and hey also no i
[03:19:38.240 --> 03:19:41.920]  do appreciate all my ancestry that led me to this point the conservative fact that millions
[03:19:41.920 --> 03:19:46.080]  millions people died and their genetic line is over all right we're gonna be right back with gavin
[03:19:46.080 --> 03:19:56.080]  mcinnis and top cover some more news rio and more this is the outshone show stay tuned

[03:24:01.040 --> 03:24:07.760]  the genesis communications radio network proudly presents the alex jones show because there's a
[03:24:07.760 --> 03:24:15.440]  war on for your mind that's right the alex jones show i'm anthony gucciardi talking about some
[03:24:15.440 --> 03:24:23.920]  serious stuff and having some fun with gavin mcinnis of compoundmedia.com twitter at gavin
[03:24:23.920 --> 03:24:29.360]  underscore mcinnis he is an entrepreneur a comedian you know it's funny thing about uh being a comedian
[03:24:29.360 --> 03:24:33.360]  not only can you get away with a lot of things which i like but that's it's really the best way to
[03:24:33.360 --> 03:24:38.800]  reach people so many people take themselves too seriously and everybody is just in this weird
[03:24:38.800 --> 03:24:43.360]  shell where you're not allowed to say certain things but when you add the element of comedy in
[03:24:43.360 --> 03:24:49.120]  there it shatters it all so gavin who's also by the way appointed himself to my relationship coach
[03:24:49.120 --> 03:24:54.480]  as of this program telling me i need to have more children and get married so i can appreciate that
[03:24:54.480 --> 03:24:59.600]  advice but uh gavin tell us a little bit about uh you know why you chose to do comedy and then
[03:24:59.600 --> 03:25:02.640]  we're going to talk about the re olympics everything like that but it doesn't help you
[03:25:02.640 --> 03:25:07.680]  reach more people yeah it's just naturally who you are i think five percent of people are funny
[03:25:07.680 --> 03:25:13.600]  and as you can tell from watching this i'm hilarious uh clearly yes the comedy scene though
[03:25:14.320 --> 03:25:21.760]  is so left-wing and so anti-trump it's bizarre and i think it has a lot to do with daddy issues
[03:25:21.760 --> 03:25:27.600]  most comedians don't have dads most comedians dads are disappointed in them so they'll vote for any
[03:25:27.600 --> 03:25:36.000]  non-dad candidate but i i find videos and movies is a great way to uh get your message across using
[03:25:36.000 --> 03:25:41.840]  comedy and you get away from stand-up and all these uptight people but even making movies and stuff
[03:25:41.840 --> 03:25:48.560]  it's amazing how much political correctness has polluted the entire genre all of being funny
[03:25:48.560 --> 03:25:55.120]  has been seriously marred by uh pc and liberal culture and that's actually good because when
[03:25:55.120 --> 03:26:00.160]  they were messing with conservatives and they were messing with roe v wade and all this other stuff
[03:26:00.160 --> 03:26:05.760]  no one really cared about that but when you mess with someone's comedy when jerry seinfeld is saying
[03:26:05.760 --> 03:26:10.320]  what the hell is going on here when chris rock is refusing to do colleges all of a sudden people
[03:26:10.320 --> 03:26:16.160]  go so wait who are these little brats that are wrecking my fun and they screwed themselves by
[03:26:16.160 --> 03:26:21.440]  doing that you know it's funny because you look at some of the best comedians back in the so-called
[03:26:21.440 --> 03:26:27.040]  day and comedy is the best avenue just shred things you can make a joke out of anything you
[03:26:27.040 --> 03:26:31.040]  look at their ridiculousness of something uh you could look at like richard prior style you could
[03:26:31.040 --> 03:26:36.800]  just dig into stuff so easy in a way you could never ever ever do in politics and it gets the
[03:26:36.800 --> 03:26:43.120]  point across and it was a lot less left-wing i mean leddie bruce was all about free speech the
[03:26:43.120 --> 03:26:48.960]  first amendment today all these same comedians are about like sarah silverman saying that these
[03:26:48.960 --> 03:26:53.520]  college students are on the right side of history uh my friend and i like sarah by the way my friend
[03:26:53.520 --> 03:26:59.280]  jim norton who i i adore was also saying that these people are on the right side of history
[03:26:59.280 --> 03:27:03.600]  these pc people and i think it's because a lot of these people and i'm not including jim and sarah
[03:27:03.600 --> 03:27:09.680]  in this but a lot of these comedians they want a tv gig so they know that one n word or one racial
[03:27:09.680 --> 03:27:16.400]  thing or one sexist or homophobic thing anywhere on my record and i could blow my tv gig so it's
[03:27:16.400 --> 03:27:21.600]  made them total and utter pussies and when you're worried about this ironically it's sarah silverman
[03:27:21.600 --> 03:27:26.640]  who said this she goes when you're worried about how someone will interpret a joke you kill the joke
[03:27:26.640 --> 03:27:32.080]  it's it's like a painting and if you work on a little too long a little too little you ruin it and
[03:27:32.080 --> 03:27:37.280]  the great great evidence there is stutter if you're saying a joke and you stutter towards the end
[03:27:37.280 --> 03:27:42.000]  the whole joke is ruined and no one will laugh that's how fragile it is and these people are
[03:27:42.000 --> 03:27:46.720]  going in there with political correctness and just blowing up the entire thing the ruining
[03:27:46.720 --> 03:27:53.040]  movies the the ruined ghostbusters the ruining stand-up comedy the ruining sketches tv sketches
[03:27:53.040 --> 03:27:59.600]  and stuff and and stuff like that it's it's just it's it it reached a breaking point this year
[03:27:59.600 --> 03:28:05.440]  and uh 2017 the rest of 2016 we're not going to see this anymore i i can't say it enough listen to
[03:28:05.440 --> 03:28:11.600]  the zombie song this will be our year because this really is our year they bent it and it broke
[03:28:11.600 --> 03:28:17.120]  because it's not actually about not being racist not being sexist i know i'm not racist i know i'm
[03:28:17.120 --> 03:28:22.080]  not sexist i know i actually empower people way more so than all of the people that claim that
[03:28:22.080 --> 03:28:28.160]  we're so racist and sexist right but it's more about word domination and ideological domination
[03:28:28.160 --> 03:28:34.320]  political correctness is not expounding ideas it's not extrapolating on free thought it's it's
[03:28:34.320 --> 03:28:39.360]  censoring it is literal censorship so you're talking about forming a joke now you have to worry
[03:28:39.360 --> 03:28:45.360]  about even me speaking right now is this going to offend someone and not because i actually
[03:28:45.360 --> 03:28:49.200]  hate that person or that group or whatever i'm totally not racist totally not sexist
[03:28:49.200 --> 03:28:54.480]  but now i have to worry about if someone's going to construe it like that so what happens is you
[03:28:54.480 --> 03:28:59.200]  put a limiter on your brain like a like a car limiter and you can only go so far now and you're
[03:28:59.200 --> 03:29:04.720]  breaking that you know good for you we're trying to break it right it's one thing to tell me i can't
[03:29:04.720 --> 03:29:10.720]  drive somewhere or i can't i can't dress like this in this establishment that's one parameter but
[03:29:10.720 --> 03:29:15.440]  when you start getting into my brain and telling me what my motives are wrong or i'm not allowed to
[03:29:15.440 --> 03:29:20.720]  think that especially when i'm not even sure where i was going with that and you're telling me what i
[03:29:20.720 --> 03:29:27.040]  was thinking like the CEO of mozilla what was his name again friend and ike he donated to something
[03:29:27.040 --> 03:29:32.160]  he believed in and got obliterated right and we don't know what his motive was i mean maybe
[03:29:32.160 --> 03:29:37.440]  he's gay and he doesn't like gays getting married because it's too conformist maybe he loves gay
[03:29:37.440 --> 03:29:41.680]  marriage but his dad's last wish see that's too much thought that's too much thought all right gav
[03:29:41.680 --> 03:29:45.360]  mcginnis we got to go to break it's been great talking to you i don't know if you're gonna want to hold
[03:29:45.360 --> 03:29:50.160]  over or not but the gevin mcginnis's website is compoundmedia.com check him out thanks a lot
[03:29:50.800 --> 03:29:56.160]  the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[03:30:00.800 --> 03:30:06.160]  one of the reasons there is so much anxiety about mrs clinton from the intelligence community
[03:30:06.160 --> 03:30:11.280]  is the belief that some of the materials that she handled with such extreme carelessness i'm using
[03:30:11.280 --> 03:30:19.280]  jim comey's phrase in my opinion it was criminal but contained the names of american undercover
[03:30:19.280 --> 03:30:25.360]  intelligence agents some of whom are no longer with us this is the belief of a lot of people in
[03:30:25.360 --> 03:30:31.680]  the intelligence community what difference at this point does it make it is our job to figure
[03:30:31.680 --> 03:30:36.320]  out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again just like
[03:30:36.320 --> 03:30:41.440]  ben gazi it does make a difference to the people who died to their families even though it makes no
[03:30:41.440 --> 03:30:46.480]  difference to her she is right about one thing however the way you prevent the betrayal of
[03:30:46.480 --> 03:30:52.080]  americans who put their lives on the line to protect the country is to keep this self-centered
[03:30:52.080 --> 03:30:59.840]  war mongering corrupt politician from ever holding office again grandpa wars dot com i'm david night

[03:33:11.920 --> 03:33:16.720]  live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones
[03:33:16.720 --> 03:33:24.960]  censorship has a new name it's tolerance don't you want to be tolerant that sounds
[03:33:24.960 --> 03:33:31.680]  way better sounds even cool and trendy and fun being tolerant is the new thing oh but wait a
[03:33:31.680 --> 03:33:36.960]  minute it's not about being tolerant because i am tolerant it's about censorship it's about
[03:33:36.960 --> 03:33:43.840]  limiting scope it's about providing favor to certain people the exact same thing that it says
[03:33:43.840 --> 03:33:51.200]  that it wants to protect example is this burkini only day at french water park criticized why i
[03:33:51.200 --> 03:33:56.000]  would hope so because you're banned unless you're wearing a burkini says a water park in france
[03:33:56.000 --> 03:34:00.640]  is to be booked out for one day to muslim women wanting to wear burkinis but the decision has
[03:34:00.640 --> 03:34:05.440]  led to criticism by politicians on the right well on the right well it seems like it should
[03:34:05.440 --> 03:34:10.000]  lead to criticism from everybody because i thought this whole thing was we're being tolerant if
[03:34:10.000 --> 03:34:15.840]  someone wants to wear a burkini at the pool great good for them who cares but i'm not allowed to
[03:34:15.840 --> 03:34:19.360]  go to the pool or i guess rather some woman is not allowed to go to the pool in a bikini
[03:34:20.240 --> 03:34:26.400]  that sounds like exactly the opposite of what's supposed to happen now imagine imagine if we had
[03:34:26.400 --> 03:34:32.320]  a muslim free day at the pool okay that would really really upset people wouldn't it gavin
[03:34:32.320 --> 03:34:36.880]  mckinnis from compoundmedia.com wouldn't that upset people but see they're allowed to say
[03:34:36.880 --> 03:34:41.440]  that only muslims i mean unless you're going to wear a burkini and not be a muslim which would
[03:34:41.440 --> 03:34:46.000]  not be the case are allowed to be at the pool this day it is literally every single thing
[03:34:46.000 --> 03:34:50.160]  that they're saying that they're you know against with oh it's so politically correct what do you
[03:34:50.160 --> 03:34:55.200]  think about that yeah didn't sir cozy try to ban the burqa i thought the burqa was banned there
[03:34:56.000 --> 03:35:03.200]  this is what's going on here we are so tolerant of everything we're tolerant of the intolerant
[03:35:03.200 --> 03:35:09.120]  so these women come from a culture that is sexist no matter how you slice it and we are tolerating
[03:35:09.120 --> 03:35:14.800]  their intolerance they can't be around us so we tolerate their their inability to deal with
[03:35:14.800 --> 03:35:23.200]  western women in bikinis and i will guarantee you that within no amount of time this burkini day
[03:35:23.200 --> 03:35:28.960]  is going to offend muslims because they are insatiable so there's going to be some sort of
[03:35:28.960 --> 03:35:34.400]  problem the bikinis will be too lavish there'll be too many colors used in them the bikini uh
[03:35:34.400 --> 03:35:39.920]  burkini hours will be too long men will be too tempted to go i guarantee you that the muslims
[03:35:39.920 --> 03:35:44.320]  will have a problem with this because like liberals they're insatiable and when you give them an inch
[03:35:44.320 --> 03:35:51.440]  they take a mile now look for me my view is we don't even have to debate any elements of the
[03:35:51.440 --> 03:35:55.920]  religion or so-called left so-called right it's easy because we can just say wow this is a logically
[03:35:55.920 --> 03:36:02.000]  stupid right so we can look at it and say burkini only day let's just say it's it's potato sack only
[03:36:02.000 --> 03:36:06.480]  day and there's a religion of people that wear potato sacks it's still horrible i mean how about
[03:36:07.120 --> 03:36:12.160]  burkini no muslim day like i said would be horrible it's absurd it's the reverse though
[03:36:12.160 --> 03:36:16.720]  it's that they say you have to tolerate which is another form of actual censorship in this case
[03:36:16.720 --> 03:36:22.560]  because tolerism is good i should walk around and not scream racial slurs of people i am not racist
[03:36:22.560 --> 03:36:29.280]  i should tolerate people's existence but this is not tolerance this is forced upon you and it's a
[03:36:29.280 --> 03:36:35.760]  mandatory form of domination well it's treating them like they're diseased too i mean if you had
[03:36:35.760 --> 03:36:39.840]  some sort of horrible peanut allergy and there was a restaurant that said we're gonna have peanut
[03:36:39.840 --> 03:36:44.880]  free day and all these people with this strange affliction they can come in here and know they're
[03:36:44.880 --> 03:36:50.080]  not going to break out in hives or we're going to have you know cancer patient day where no one
[03:36:50.080 --> 03:36:54.640]  will stare at you if you're bald from chemo because everyone will look like that well i'm afraid
[03:36:54.640 --> 03:37:00.480]  that muslim isn't some sort of medical affliction it's not a condition it's not a disease so to
[03:37:00.480 --> 03:37:06.080]  treat this like we have to tenderly walk around them on eggshells and make sure they're okay with
[03:37:06.080 --> 03:37:13.360]  their horrible disease it's almost just as demeaning as islamophobia look you came over here you have
[03:37:13.360 --> 03:37:19.600]  to follow the the culture of the place you moved to you think we would get away with big tit day
[03:37:19.600 --> 03:37:26.560]  in afghanistan that's actually yeah that's funny it is also a form of discrimination against them
[03:37:26.560 --> 03:37:31.600]  to treat like you know well you're safe here and it brings me to this point i also want to add that
[03:37:31.600 --> 03:37:36.640]  you know in kindergarten now they have pictures of white people and black people and there's
[03:37:36.640 --> 03:37:40.880]  kindergartners running around they don't even care about any of this absurdity and they'll say this
[03:37:40.880 --> 03:37:46.320]  is a black person this is a white person this is a male this is a female and the kindergartners like
[03:37:46.320 --> 03:37:49.920]  what and i've seen i've seen so many emails and screenshots of these types of things
[03:37:49.920 --> 03:37:54.640]  sent in uh from parents and the kindergartners are like what this is just my best friend i don't
[03:37:54.640 --> 03:37:58.960]  understand they're like this is a black person this is a white person except except and the
[03:37:58.960 --> 03:38:03.600]  kindergartners like what i accept everybody i love everybody it's when you make it such a big
[03:38:03.600 --> 03:38:08.960]  issue that's what's actually racist yeah and you know as a as a parent which you'll soon learn if
[03:38:08.960 --> 03:38:16.960]  you follow my plan uh that's one of your biggest goals there's the santa thing there's uh hiding
[03:38:16.960 --> 03:38:23.680]  9 11 and there's not letting them know that race is a thing they should just see that someone is
[03:38:23.680 --> 03:38:27.440]  darker than someone and it's going to happen inevitably they're going to learn that there's
[03:38:27.440 --> 03:38:34.160]  this big hullabaloo about melanin but your goal as a parent among other forms of innocence like sex
[03:38:34.160 --> 03:38:40.720]  is to delay that for as long as possible and to keep them i'm sorry but naive as possible for
[03:38:40.720 --> 03:38:44.640]  as long as you can and then these schools come in and they go you know that he's basically a slave
[03:38:44.640 --> 03:38:48.480]  and you're a plantation owner right and you go first of all that's not true but secondly will
[03:38:48.480 --> 03:38:55.760]  you shut up and stop showing them porno basically racial porn when they're eight years old you know
[03:38:55.760 --> 03:39:01.760]  four years old and you said you said naive and i would say it's not even naivete it's it's it's
[03:39:01.760 --> 03:39:07.680]  more like stopping them from buying into the lie because it's almost like no it's not being naive
[03:39:07.680 --> 03:39:13.520]  to just not see the see be be racist i mean it's like it's it's truly we should model ourselves
[03:39:13.520 --> 03:39:17.680]  after what children do they don't care about any of this you think they're sitting around arguing
[03:39:17.680 --> 03:39:22.720]  about uh religious and political beliefs with other kindergartners no or the color of their skin
[03:39:22.720 --> 03:39:27.200]  or or the differences they have no absolutely not it's not even an issue it's only an issue
[03:39:27.200 --> 03:39:31.840]  when the media over and over again tries to make an issue and i will remind everybody of this
[03:39:32.480 --> 03:39:37.920]  cnn show trashes trump 200 times more than covering obama's 400 million dollar rand payment
[03:39:37.920 --> 03:39:42.960]  g is the warped reality media trying to force something down your throats yeah they are that's
[03:39:42.960 --> 03:39:47.920]  why every single time anything happens they just push push push the angle if it bleeds it leads
[03:39:47.920 --> 03:39:52.880]  and they are the ones driving this fake narrative that no one's even buying thoughts on you gotta
[03:39:52.880 --> 03:39:58.320]  check out this movie it's i think it's almost 10 years old now media malpractice and it was all about
[03:39:58.320 --> 03:40:03.920]  this the obama campaign oh no this would only be uh four years old sorry that's about the obama
[03:40:03.920 --> 03:40:10.080]  campaign with sarah palin and how cnn anderson cooper especially was obsessed with sarah palin's
[03:40:10.080 --> 03:40:16.400]  hundred thousand dollar wardrobe and cnn went on and on about a dozens of times yet reverend right
[03:40:16.400 --> 03:40:20.720]  they the only time it would come up was from for anderson cooper to discredit it and say
[03:40:20.720 --> 03:40:25.440]  isn't this politics as usual and hasn't he always already disavowed reverend right and why are we
[03:40:25.440 --> 03:40:30.160]  even talking about that in fact john roberts in media malpractice they show a clip on cnn where
[03:40:30.160 --> 03:40:36.480]  john roberts goes to obama he goes this is a reverend right free zone we will not be covering this
[03:40:36.480 --> 03:40:44.560]  so cnn is exactly as bad as msnbc and that goes down to vox and daily coasts and mic they are all
[03:40:44.560 --> 03:40:51.120]  far far less sites and i think cnn has somehow gotten away with being known as somewhat unbiased
[03:40:51.120 --> 03:40:56.800]  but even twitter is shooting it's shooting very far to the left because they're petrified of trump
[03:40:56.800 --> 03:41:02.080]  there's a bias everywhere the idea of being unbiased is a joke every single person is biased some
[03:41:02.080 --> 03:41:08.000]  people are more towards bias in reality some people are more towards bias and distorted reality and
[03:41:08.000 --> 03:41:13.120]  sadly of course the uh button paid for mainstream media system they're biased towards uh warped
[03:41:13.120 --> 03:41:18.160]  reality uh don't they seem like saboteurs i mean when we when when you and me and alex talk about
[03:41:18.160 --> 03:41:23.120]  stuff we talk about things that are tangible like 400 million dollars going to iran when they talk
[03:41:23.120 --> 03:41:29.600]  about stuff they are purposely censoring information they are telling lies so it's really
[03:41:29.600 --> 03:41:35.200]  propaganda versus just saying the facts i mean i'm happy to criticize trump about a bunch of stuff
[03:41:35.200 --> 03:41:41.440]  but they won't do that with hillary they won't do that with obama it's always a lack of details
[03:41:41.440 --> 03:41:44.960]  so you say you know you're willing to criticize trump for example though someone could take a
[03:41:44.960 --> 03:41:49.280]  screenshot from the show if you're wearing a trump shirt and they could say starch obsessed
[03:41:49.280 --> 03:41:53.920]  trump supporter right but i bet just like me i could criticize a ton of things about trump
[03:41:53.920 --> 03:41:58.800]  right i could criticize a ton of things i could argue with myself and criticize myself okay it's
[03:41:58.800 --> 03:42:04.160]  all about the details uh it shows crowd hammer said it he goes they think we're evil we just think
[03:42:04.160 --> 03:42:11.360]  they're wrong and i i don't even believe in in a difference of opinion i don't think it's true
[03:42:11.360 --> 03:42:17.040]  i think it's just one person having less facts than the other but once you pile up all the facts
[03:42:17.040 --> 03:42:21.760]  the truth becomes irrevocable it's sitting right there in front of you you can't just agree if you
[03:42:21.760 --> 03:42:27.440]  agree to disagree then it means one of you has given up on getting the facts it's also an issue
[03:42:27.440 --> 03:42:32.080]  of emotion verse facts too right because look at the reo olympics and uh the producers said that you
[03:42:32.080 --> 03:42:36.080]  had to head out here in a minute are you still good to go i gotta go okay all right cool well
[03:42:36.080 --> 03:42:42.480]  then i'll let you head off but uh it it it reminds me of also reo right because they say oh emotionally
[03:42:42.480 --> 03:42:46.720]  it's like well we're gonna give them a chance it's amazing it's gonna be so fun no it's not uh
[03:42:46.720 --> 03:42:50.400]  everyone's getting robbed there's a security risk the police and fire are saying don't come in here
[03:42:50.400 --> 03:42:55.280]  you're gonna die it's a joke it's emotion verse reality and people are just getting played like
[03:42:55.280 --> 03:42:59.920]  a heart by the emotion system uh final comments before you got to head off uh gavin mckinnis
[03:43:00.560 --> 03:43:05.120]  i would like to say as an immigrant to america who has lived all over the world i was born in
[03:43:05.120 --> 03:43:11.360]  england i've lived in china i was raised mostly in canada i am honored to be here and there the
[03:43:11.360 --> 03:43:16.560]  level of ingratitude here the number of ingrates is downright embarrassing i mean when i saw roots
[03:43:16.560 --> 03:43:22.160]  playing on memorial day it made me want to go up to vet and just apologize these people are so
[03:43:22.160 --> 03:43:27.680]  ungrateful these americans are so ungrateful about this wonderful country we have where we accept
[03:43:27.680 --> 03:43:33.840]  more immigrants than any other country in the world combined we are more religiously tolerant we treat
[03:43:33.840 --> 03:43:38.480]  gays better than anyone else we treat women better than anyone else and if you want to talk about
[03:43:38.480 --> 03:43:43.760]  northern europe okay let's talk about the entire west then the point is that we are the most civilized
[03:43:43.760 --> 03:43:49.280]  and free and we seem to be getting the most derision for it i think that americans need to
[03:43:49.280 --> 03:43:54.080]  go on a world tour and come back and kiss the ground they walk on because it really is an honor
[03:43:54.080 --> 03:43:59.440]  being part of this country very well said gavin mckinnis compoundmedia.com thanks so much for

[03:46:24.320 --> 03:46:30.720]  it's amazing it really is awesome now let's get into some of this so you know we talk about all of
[03:46:30.720 --> 03:46:35.280]  this uh we talk about these things first and foremost it's so important to understand when we
[03:46:35.280 --> 03:46:41.600]  talk about political incorrectness uh we're we're voyaging into a path that very few people are
[03:46:41.600 --> 03:46:47.680]  willing to voyage into because it's kind of like going into a forest uh some twigs and weird stuff
[03:46:47.680 --> 03:46:50.800]  is going to fall on you and by the time you walk out of it you're going to be covered in some junk
[03:46:50.800 --> 03:46:56.400]  right well that's what happens when you talk about these uh unmentionable subjects right when
[03:46:56.400 --> 03:47:01.360]  like when we talk about in kindergarten how these poor children are told this is a black person this
[03:47:01.360 --> 03:47:06.880]  is a white person you see most people aren't you're not allowed to talk about that kind of stuff
[03:47:06.880 --> 03:47:12.880]  but you see we actually care because we want to progress humanity and we don't want children to be
[03:47:12.880 --> 03:47:17.920]  turned into actual racist by showing them this is different we're different because we're really
[03:47:17.920 --> 03:47:23.200]  not different and it's one of those things also that reminds me of uh the Rio Olympics and I
[03:47:23.200 --> 03:47:28.560]  talk about this a lot because it's such a great perspective now I feel very very sad for all the
[03:47:28.560 --> 03:47:33.280]  people that live in Rio or in the in the area and I feel bad for the athletes yes they're highly
[03:47:33.280 --> 03:47:38.320]  paid whatever etc but they are in Rio and they've been told to close their mouths they can't drink
[03:47:38.320 --> 03:47:44.320]  the water that they're swimming in two teaspoons is enough to give you an infection and all the
[03:47:44.320 --> 03:47:50.800]  anti-diarrhea medicine in the world is not going to save you right but instead of foreseeing all
[03:47:50.800 --> 03:47:55.760]  these problems which many did uh the officials at the olympics you know they're just like it's fine
[03:47:55.760 --> 03:48:00.320]  it's going to be so safe like it's going to be great and it ties into what I was just talking
[03:48:00.320 --> 03:48:06.640]  about with Gavin people that have never even been outside the country and seen um true true
[03:48:06.640 --> 03:48:11.840]  third world conditions or I guess you can see very very sad conditions in many places like
[03:48:11.840 --> 03:48:15.840]  Philadelphia where I grew up you could see horrible conditions right but a lot of people have never
[03:48:15.840 --> 03:48:21.520]  seen anything like that and they think that the world is just some magical suburb where everyone
[03:48:21.520 --> 03:48:28.000]  gets deliveries from vitamin water and you know everyone's happy with Botox and and smiling all
[03:48:28.000 --> 03:48:33.520]  the time it's not the case it's really a really vicious world out there and we should be grateful
[03:48:33.520 --> 03:48:37.680]  for what we have wherever you are listening around the world you know there's a lot going on now we
[03:48:37.680 --> 03:48:44.000]  talked about this at length the the hurdler that was vomited on the danish olympic team hit by thieves
[03:48:44.000 --> 03:48:51.920]  I mean the media acts like it's it's unexpected you're having a massive event in a country that's
[03:48:51.920 --> 03:48:57.440]  in turmoil in an area that's totally totally in turmoil um and this stuff like this should be
[03:48:57.440 --> 03:49:05.200]  expected Rio 2016 officials forced to cut their way into olympic stadium after losing keys to gate
[03:49:05.200 --> 03:49:10.080]  so they couldn't even get in the gate a bbc reporter in Rio de Janeiro captured the incident
[03:49:10.080 --> 03:49:15.040]  on video outside the stadium prior to wednesday's women's football match between sweden and south
[03:49:15.040 --> 03:49:20.960]  africa two men described as firemen are seen using a pair of bolt cutters to break the padlock and
[03:49:20.960 --> 03:49:25.680]  open the gate so there may be who even knows you know what kind of officials they are they're just
[03:49:25.680 --> 03:49:31.200]  oh these are officials I love that word by the way don't worry these are officials when you hear
[03:49:31.200 --> 03:49:35.200]  the word officials you should oh yes absolutely you could probably walk into a bank and say I'm an
[03:49:35.200 --> 03:49:41.920]  official I need all of the money in your storage please in the vaults give it over and then this
[03:49:41.920 --> 03:49:49.280]  as Rio games approach 1.3 million tickets left unsold I say good that's great you know why
[03:49:49.280 --> 03:49:53.200]  because the police and fire with holding the side saying don't come here you're pretty much going to
[03:49:53.200 --> 03:49:58.800]  die uh maybe we should listen to that but you see it kind of goes back into the whole uh
[03:49:58.800 --> 03:50:03.760]  tolerance thing political correctness thing where you're it's bad to talk about how unsafe
[03:50:03.760 --> 03:50:12.160]  a place like this is so in response I am suggesting officially here on the auction show
[03:50:12.160 --> 03:50:19.920]  so official uh suggestion that we hold the next olympic games in Juarez Mexico uh I believe it
[03:50:19.920 --> 03:50:25.280]  will be a great place for the games I believe it will you know just will ignore all the safety
[03:50:25.280 --> 03:50:29.200]  implications the fact that the violence is worse there than ever you can basically see from the
[03:50:29.200 --> 03:50:35.200]  border just like mortars going off and fires you know craziness Juarez Mexico would be a great
[03:50:35.200 --> 03:50:41.280]  spot for the olympic games uh next time around of course I'm kidding because it's highly unsafe
[03:50:41.280 --> 03:50:48.480]  and terrible and it's not politically incorrect I guess it is to say that uh Rio clearly 1.3 million
[03:50:48.480 --> 03:50:51.520]  tickets left unsold for good reason we'll be right back at the Alex Jones show I'm Anthony
[03:50:51.520 --> 03:50:59.200]  Goodshart he wants more to come

[03:54:13.840 --> 03:54:17.840]  when you look at stories like this that we're about to cover is that there's two
[03:54:17.840 --> 03:54:24.320]  two different goals one is to advance every single thing that we've worked for in advanced
[03:54:24.320 --> 03:54:32.480]  humanity and the second is to push humanity backwards and take control and and try and
[03:54:32.480 --> 03:54:40.160]  dominate something that is really beautiful and has been such an amazing progress right so you
[03:54:40.160 --> 03:54:47.520]  look at this first story is private company wins us clearance to fly to the moon i think this is
[03:54:47.520 --> 03:54:52.480]  an amazing thing uh florida-based company won u.s. government permission on wednesday to send a
[03:54:52.480 --> 03:54:56.960]  robotic lander to the moon next year the firm's founder said making the first time the united
[03:54:56.960 --> 03:55:02.720]  states has cleared a private space mission to fly beyond earth's orbit the f a a unprecedented go
[03:55:02.720 --> 03:55:06.560]  ahead for the moon express mission also sets a legal and regulatory framework for a host
[03:55:06.560 --> 03:55:10.960]  of other commercial expeditions to the moon asteroids and mars great we need more space
[03:55:10.960 --> 03:55:17.520]  exploration nasa's nasa's budget is terrible pretty much you look at hillary clinton she doesn't want
[03:55:17.520 --> 03:55:23.600]  to expand the budget a lot of candidates for whatever reason do not nasa regardless of your
[03:55:23.600 --> 03:55:28.240]  beliefs clearly we need to go and we need to explore space the wonders of the universe there's
[03:55:28.240 --> 03:55:34.480]  so much out there it's beautiful now then look at this right juxtaposition here north korea hopes
[03:55:34.480 --> 03:55:41.920]  the plant flag on the moon this is from ap and fortunately ap printed there we go north korean
[03:55:41.920 --> 03:55:46.640]  space officials are hard at work on a five-year plan to put more advanced satellite into orbit by
[03:55:46.640 --> 03:55:53.440]  2020 and don't intend to stop there they're also aiming for the moon and beyond now what's funny is
[03:55:54.240 --> 03:56:00.240]  key phrase there it says you know they're working on advanced satellites into orbit by 2020 yeah i
[03:56:00.240 --> 03:56:05.200]  wonder why that is it couldn't be for military operations or anything like that they just want
[03:56:05.200 --> 03:56:09.840]  to plant a flag on the moon an interview with the associated press the senior official north korea's
[03:56:09.840 --> 03:56:14.800]  version of nasa said international sanctions won't stop the country from launching more satellites
[03:56:14.800 --> 03:56:19.760]  by 2020 and that he hopes to see the north korean flag on the moon within the next 10 years even though
[03:56:19.760 --> 03:56:24.400]  the u.s. and its allies try to block our space development our aerospace scientists will conquer
[03:56:24.400 --> 03:56:31.280]  space and definitely plant the flag of the dp rk on the moon yes absolutely it definitely has to do
[03:56:31.280 --> 03:56:36.400]  with the flag on the moon like i said and not any type of militaristic activity but you see there's
[03:56:36.400 --> 03:56:42.480]  one thing here we want to explore space and find its mysteries and understand the universe better
[03:56:42.480 --> 03:56:46.880]  there's so much that we don't know right uh just imagine we how much we don't know about the ocean
[03:56:46.880 --> 03:56:55.120]  well times that by quadrillion in that space we want to expand but at the same time look at what's
[03:56:55.120 --> 03:56:59.200]  holding us back right look at what's holding us back instead of putting the funding into that
[03:56:59.200 --> 03:57:06.080]  instead of companies being created to launch these missions companies instead have to focus on things
[03:57:06.080 --> 03:57:12.240]  like paying massive amounts of taxes and being screwed over and also we have to remember that
[03:57:12.240 --> 03:57:17.280]  certain groups you know north korea is too busy trying to launch satellites and let's not remember
[03:57:17.280 --> 03:57:22.960]  this this type of thing is also what's preventing us from leaping forward fed announced that goldman
[03:57:22.960 --> 03:57:28.400]  sacks has agreed to pay 36.3 million to settle allegations by the federal reserve that it obtained
[03:57:28.400 --> 03:57:33.520]  and used confidential regulatory materials from the central bank two years ago what's that amount to
[03:57:33.520 --> 03:57:41.600]  this amounts to 0.1 percent of the firm's 2015 revenue of 33.8 billion and wow the banks also
[03:57:41.600 --> 03:57:46.400]  make money from taxpayer dollars 80 plus billion bloomberg said originally it was around that and
[03:57:46.400 --> 03:57:51.040]  then i think it was 180 and then they released again that it was far more so you see we can't go to
[03:57:51.040 --> 03:57:55.360]  space because the banks are looting everything and they're getting away with it and it's all a big
[03:57:55.360 --> 03:58:01.600]  joke and then we're left to pay the bill um so there we go but leaving on good news italy passed a
[03:58:01.600 --> 03:58:07.280]  law to encourage all supermarkets to give unsold food to the needy that'll feed 200 million people
[03:58:07.280 --> 03:58:11.200]  and this is actually the answer to world hunger so italy's doing a great job feeding 200 plus
[03:58:11.200 --> 03:58:16.240]  million people it's been an interesting show gavin mcinnis was a very uh enjoyable discussion
