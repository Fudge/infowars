[00:00.000 --> 00:25.120]  From the Infowars.com News Center, deep behind enemy lines in occupied Texas, broadcasting
[00:25.120 --> 00:31.120]  worldwide, you're listening to the voice of human resistance against the technotronic
[00:31.120 --> 00:41.920]  technocracy tank-over. You're listening to Alex Jones. Here we are, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:41.920 --> 00:51.120]  broadcasting worldwide, Thursday, the 6th of April, 2017. Wow. We have got a jam-packed
[00:51.120 --> 00:54.400]  broadcast with four or five guests today. I'll tell you about coming up the start of the next
[00:54.400 --> 01:02.240]  segment, but I've seen what three or four gas attacks the last four years in Syria and every
[01:02.240 --> 01:09.760]  time it comes out that Al-Nusra, Al-Qaeda, and now ISIS, same group, different names, are the ones behind it.
[01:14.160 --> 01:18.560]  But then instantly we're told these planes fly over and then a few witnesses in the town
[01:18.560 --> 01:25.440]  say that they dropped nerve gas on them. But then we don't ever see any proof.
[01:26.720 --> 01:30.400]  And as Senator Rand Paul's come out and said he's really cautioning the president
[01:31.920 --> 01:36.400]  not to wade to this quagmire where you've got at least five different factions,
[01:37.200 --> 01:41.840]  four of the five factions, different Wahhabist groups, battling each other for six years trying
[01:41.840 --> 01:45.920]  to take the country over. It was not a civil war. It was a globalist-financed invasion
[01:45.920 --> 01:49.920]  with Saudi Arabia. And now Iran's in the middle of it. It is a disaster.
[01:51.920 --> 01:58.320]  And if we go into there, it is never going to end. It is just going to be ongoing.
[02:00.480 --> 02:05.040]  Former Congressman Ron Paul has come out and said the Syrian chemical attack makes no sense
[02:05.040 --> 02:10.880]  and is a false flag. That's up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com. Paul Watson's written
[02:10.880 --> 02:17.120]  an article about it. Ron Paul, chemical weapons attack at Syria likely a false flag. Why is that?
[02:20.480 --> 02:29.760]  Because we've caught the Wahhabist doing it at least four of the five times it's happened.
[02:29.760 --> 02:33.920]  Why would, if there's a red line and they're saying we're going to attack you and invade you
[02:33.920 --> 02:38.080]  and overthrow you if you use chemical weapons, they're not even very useful in warfare of this
[02:38.080 --> 02:45.200]  type. And then why would Assad do that? Trump then signals that, well, this is changing my mind on this
[02:46.160 --> 02:51.600]  because his generals, he's got some neocons in there now, tell him, oh, we think it might be
[02:51.600 --> 02:55.760]  from according to what the witnesses said. And CNN, the folks that told you about babies throwing
[02:55.760 --> 03:02.640]  incubators and WMDs in Iraq, the same suspects are out there pushing war yet again. And a lot of
[03:02.640 --> 03:07.600]  people in the Trump cabinet think that if they just go along with the neocon globalist agenda,
[03:07.600 --> 03:10.880]  they're going to leave Trump alone. They're never going to leave Trump alone. For the great sin
[03:12.000 --> 03:16.240]  of being a nationalist and trying to promote prosperity for the general public, they want
[03:16.240 --> 03:21.520]  to destroy Trump. And sure enough, they're coming out now saying too late, Trump, even though you
[03:21.520 --> 03:26.640]  say you might want to go in militarily now and actually topple Assad, not al-Qaeda, too late,
[03:26.640 --> 03:43.360]  Trump, you didn't act in the last 77 days. You didn't react. So now Syria is your fault again
[03:43.360 --> 03:51.920]  when Hillary and Obama and the globalist brag that they started the entire civil war,
[03:51.920 --> 03:57.680]  which is an al-Qaeda invasion. That's the facts. That's what happened.
[03:58.880 --> 04:04.400]  Drudge has the hydrogen bomb going off on the front page. Republicans push the button.
[04:05.360 --> 04:11.040]  They're going to the nuclear option. We're going to break that down. That's just breaking as we speak.
[04:15.120 --> 04:19.040]  Judge Knapp says unmasking Americans for reasons other than national security is called espionage.
[04:19.040 --> 04:22.240]  That's right, private, corporate, democratic party espionage.
[04:24.480 --> 04:28.000]  We also have Russia challenging Trump to say what he would do about Syria,
[04:28.640 --> 04:33.280]  because they've said remove Assad. We don't care. Just let us have our one port in the Mediterranean
[04:33.280 --> 04:38.960]  that we've had. Let us have access to the Mediterranean and you can put in a government
[04:38.960 --> 04:42.960]  there. You have to have a coalition government and it can't be Wahhabist because they'll kill
[04:42.960 --> 04:49.200]  everybody. And Russia's been saying that for four years. Our military's been saying that. Our
[04:49.200 --> 04:53.200]  military's been working with the Russians to try to kick al-Qaeda out, but then John McCain a
[04:53.200 --> 04:59.280]  month ago flies over to Syria to stir stuff up. We even predicted to set up a false flag. We even said
[04:59.280 --> 05:07.120]  that. Corey Lewandowski, Paul Manafort, Mike Flynn, Steve Bannon, and now Devin Nunes. It seems
[05:07.120 --> 05:11.600]  the left's intimidation tactics are actually working. Nunes is the latest to be asked to step
[05:11.600 --> 05:15.840]  aside after an intense few weeks of grilling from the left as the House Intelligence Chairman has
[05:15.840 --> 05:20.560]  now recused himself from the Russian probe. Isn't that too convenient for the Democrats to have the
[05:20.560 --> 05:24.160]  only one involved in this Russian probe who actually seems to care about the truth of the
[05:24.160 --> 05:29.200]  matter, step aside and recuse himself. Just to rub our noses in it, Representative Adam Schiff,
[05:29.200 --> 05:33.200]  Democrat member of the House Intelligence Committee, made a public statement moments after
[05:33.200 --> 05:38.800]  Nunes' announcement saying how pleased he was to hear of Nunes' recusal. So now the Democrats
[05:38.800 --> 05:43.440]  have a monopoly on the political witch hunt that is the Russian probe. Thanks, Nunes. The Republicans
[05:43.440 --> 05:47.760]  have gotten their leverage democratically and refused to use it. The Democrats get their leverage
[05:47.760 --> 05:52.720]  with smear campaigns and use it successfully. And if we keep allowing them to do it, they're going
[05:52.720 --> 05:58.800]  to continue. President Trump, the swamp is draining us. For Infowars.com, this is Owen Schreuer.
[06:01.280 --> 06:06.480]  Today we call it bone broth. And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits
[06:06.480 --> 06:11.440]  before it became a loss to our modern diets of processed junk. We are now introducing Caveman
[06:11.440 --> 06:17.520]  by InfowarsLife.com, the ultimate and true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga
[06:17.520 --> 06:23.920]  mushroom and seven total primal superfoods in a single great tasting formula. Caveman, it's those
[06:23.920 --> 06:28.560]  people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[06:28.560 --> 06:33.680]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that. Everyone knew that you used all the parts
[06:33.680 --> 06:38.560]  of the animal. You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for
[06:38.560 --> 06:43.360]  strength from the outside structure full of minerals and Kiko factors to the marrow that
[06:43.360 --> 06:48.560]  produces the blood for the body. This is the engine of the life essence. I'm a long way from the
[06:48.560 --> 06:53.440]  Caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as well trying to get back to that essence that made us
[06:53.440 --> 06:57.040]  what we were. And this is a big part of it. I know you're going to want to check out Caveman,
[06:57.040 --> 07:02.800]  ultimate paleo formula for yourself and ForWarsLife.com today. Please listen carefully because I'm
[07:02.800 --> 07:07.200]  about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality

[08:17.600 --> 08:24.080]  Yes, I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House.
[08:24.080 --> 08:28.320]  Protesters followed Trump supporters to their cars as they left the convention center
[08:28.320 --> 08:33.440]  around the corner and away from police protection on St. Carlo Street, a mob mentality took over.
[08:37.360 --> 08:41.040]  What do you say to the people who are who dragged a poor white guy out of a car and beat him?
[08:41.040 --> 08:46.800]  Oh my goodness, four white people, please, all my stuff. These were pure attacks. Trump supporters,
[08:46.800 --> 08:51.840]  men, women, even the elderly left this building last night and walked right into danger.
[08:51.840 --> 08:55.840]  Police say anti-Trump protesters sprayed five Trump supporters,
[08:55.840 --> 08:59.760]  including an eight and 11 year old girl outside Anaheim City Hall.
[08:59.760 --> 09:03.200]  They're throwing things at the guy who had the Trump shirt on.
[09:03.200 --> 09:06.560]  Oh, he just got knocked in the back of the head, he just got punched in the face,
[09:07.680 --> 09:08.560]  and now they're rushing him.
[09:20.560 --> 09:25.360]  We're saying if you're out there and you're trying to represent your First Amendment right
[09:25.360 --> 09:30.240]  to free speech, if somebody comes and attacks you, it's your right to defend yourself.
[09:30.240 --> 09:35.760]  It got ugly. Violence erupting at the event is fight, broke out,
[09:35.760 --> 09:41.600]  fifth, flying between Trump supporters and anti-Trump supporters. It gets pretty ugly.
[09:41.600 --> 09:45.680]  Yeah, I want to warn the folks watching at home, you're about to see some very violent footage.
[09:52.640 --> 09:58.000]  Organizers say today's rallies were meant as a show of unity against what they call a seditious
[09:58.000 --> 10:00.960]  friend allegedly trying to sabotage the president.
[10:02.560 --> 10:07.200]  You can see there a FedEx delivery driver jumping in to try to put an end to the protest.
[10:07.200 --> 10:10.320]  You don't like, you don't like to get the f*** out of this. Just to strike the numbers,
[10:10.320 --> 10:13.600]  and I'll give it to you, if you want to come at me, give everybody a hundred of you against one
[10:13.600 --> 10:20.560]  of me, because that's what it's going to take. Believe me, people like myself will stand up
[10:20.560 --> 10:24.640]  and we'll be coming right back at you. You say you're the president and you shouldn't be here.
[10:24.640 --> 10:31.280]  Donald Trump is bringing us together. You got that? This is the heart of 1776.
[10:31.280 --> 10:40.640]  And this is the Live Global Thursday edition of the transmission. Thank you so much. It is
[10:40.640 --> 10:51.440]  already the sixth day, hard to believe, of April 2017. Again, I'm your host Alex Jones.
[10:52.480 --> 11:00.080]  We have a lot of informative, I guess, to say the least today. And we have Dr. Paul Craig Roberts
[11:00.080 --> 11:03.200]  hadn't been on in a while to break down the geopolitical and military developments in the
[11:03.200 --> 11:10.000]  South China Sea and the Korean Peninsula. We have Michael Schneider on huge breakdowns on
[11:10.000 --> 11:14.640]  the chain reactions of military action taking place in Syria, but again, also in the South
[11:14.640 --> 11:19.040]  China Sea and how that ties together. All these different flare-ups happening at the same time,
[11:19.040 --> 11:24.640]  just like we witnessed before other major war start. Millie Weaver from on the ground in California
[11:24.640 --> 11:34.160]  investigating with law enforcement and certified orphanages and other institutions of all the
[11:34.160 --> 11:41.440]  verified child trafficking, child kidnapping, Satanism, all of it. They're there really doing
[11:41.440 --> 11:45.920]  an in-depth investigation. They're going to bring back an HD video for everybody, for the
[11:45.920 --> 11:50.080]  TV viewers and for the radio audience to really document what's going on, now that MSM is denying
[11:50.080 --> 11:55.520]  that pedophilia even exists in between salon magazine promoting it is a wonderful thing. And
[11:55.520 --> 12:00.960]  then we're also going to have John Rappaport on the transmission hosting the fourth hour as he does
[12:00.960 --> 12:10.240]  every two weeks doing a great job. All right. Here's the different quadrants of news. We have
[12:10.240 --> 12:16.800]  the big chemical weapon attack in Syria and you have Ron Paul saying he believes it's a false flag.
[12:16.800 --> 12:21.760]  I remember the days when Ron Paul
[12:25.760 --> 12:31.280]  would not talk about false flags, but it's a great thing to see now that this is so mainstream
[12:31.280 --> 12:37.600]  that Ron Paul's come out, his son has come out and said to the senator that he's urging Trump
[12:37.600 --> 12:41.760]  not to take military action in Syria. I don't want to support people who hate our country. Yeah,
[12:41.760 --> 12:46.320]  we're going to go take a sod out who never attacked us and put al-Qaeda in. That's what this means.
[12:49.360 --> 12:54.240]  Why would a sod if he was told you use chemical weapons four years ago, we will invade you
[12:55.440 --> 13:00.880]  and we will bombard Damascus with a full U.S. Air Force along with NATO. We'll fire
[13:00.880 --> 13:08.240]  cruise missiles by the thousands at you. Why would they then have planes fly over a village
[13:08.240 --> 13:17.040]  and then bomb it. Damascus says they bombed an al-Qaeda ISIS chemical plant and al-Qaeda and ISIS
[13:17.600 --> 13:22.320]  have hundreds of videos online and you can go search engine them. They put them up as fast
[13:22.320 --> 13:28.560]  you can take them down of them, nerve-gassing dogs, people testing it. They were caught. The U.N.
[13:28.560 --> 13:32.720]  even came out three years ago and said no on the one-year anniversary of the red line declaration
[13:32.720 --> 13:44.800]  by Obama. It was Al-Nusra launching the mortars to blame a sod. But we get these reports and the
[13:44.800 --> 13:55.040]  Joint Chiefs tell Trump that we believe this is a sod doing this and now we know this is what we
[13:55.040 --> 14:01.440]  speculated yesterday. This is what our expert, Yassar Jules-Scousen, speculated yesterday
[14:01.440 --> 14:06.160]  that Bannon probably was out of national security, still Chief Advisor because he would not go along
[14:06.160 --> 14:10.640]  with the new neocon generals that are in there who want war and who are going along with John
[14:10.640 --> 14:18.000]  McCain's agenda. And now the reports out that Daniels breaks it down with links to mainstream news.
[14:18.000 --> 14:21.840]  Bannon removal, a whipped up controversy by mainstream media, but then it goes further
[14:21.840 --> 14:26.960]  to break down that he was clashing with the generals and did not want to go along with
[14:26.960 --> 14:32.720]  the Syria situation, this huge quagmire. And that's what General Flynn had advised them on.
[14:32.720 --> 14:37.600]  He ran those operations not backing Al Qaeda and ISIS starting five years ago
[14:38.720 --> 14:42.320]  and our military stood up and said no to that. Remember we're not going to be Al Qaeda's Air Force?
[14:42.880 --> 14:48.320]  Remember Senator Rand Paul and others and Senator Cruz making those statements because that's what's
[14:48.320 --> 14:58.640]  happening here. That's what's happening here. Bannon threatened to resign completely over
[14:58.640 --> 15:07.120]  classes with McMaster, Kushner and Ivanka. And he's the only guy that was up there that is
[15:07.120 --> 15:11.680]  real Americana and has a battle plan to save the country and Trump has been adopting it.
[15:11.680 --> 15:15.680]  That's why he's public enemy number one, Stephen Bannon. And I'm not against Kushner and Ivanka
[15:15.680 --> 15:20.560]  and all these other people. They just are from New York City with a lot of rich liberals around
[15:20.560 --> 15:26.560]  them and they admit they've been Democrats and they just can't seem to get it. Trump has been
[15:26.560 --> 15:33.360]  basically a John Berger forever, sat at the knee of the head lawyer from the Un-American Activities
[15:33.360 --> 15:38.560]  Committee, Roy Cohn. And if you actually go back to New York Times articles from 30 years ago
[15:38.560 --> 15:43.280]  where they interviewed Trump, he was like a super nationalistic Uber right-winger.
[15:43.280 --> 15:48.320]  But he played along with the liberals and stuff for business. And that's why they hate his guts
[15:48.320 --> 15:52.400]  because you see his action, turning the jobs on, securing the borders, all these good things.
[15:54.080 --> 15:58.480]  He has to understand though, if he plays along with the neocons, they'll hang this failed war
[15:58.480 --> 16:02.640]  in a couple years around his neck. And by the way, they're already in the news saying,
[16:02.640 --> 16:09.520]  oh, too little, too late. Syria's your fault now. Even though Obama and Hillary and all of the start
[16:09.520 --> 16:13.840]  of the Arab Spring with Saudi Arabia ran the whole deal. Google, social media backed it.
[16:13.840 --> 16:18.240]  They did this six years ago. They kicked it off at Tunisia and then Libya. They went and made
[16:18.240 --> 16:24.960]  all those states become failed states. They did it on purpose. Islamic state of Al-Qaeda,
[16:24.960 --> 16:29.840]  that's what it is, is spread all over the world now from less than two countries over 30
[16:31.840 --> 16:37.840]  in six years. This is a major Islamic offensive and Ergun is directing it and directing the Muslims
[16:37.840 --> 16:42.400]  going into Europe. Almost all of them are hobbyists, Sunnis, saying we're invading, we're taking over
[16:42.400 --> 16:48.800]  Europe. We're dictating to you. We're controlling you. You will do what we say or we'll have a holy
[16:48.800 --> 16:55.280]  war and burn your capitals down. The globalist or ally with Islam. And notice Turkey isn't
[16:55.280 --> 16:58.720]  non-radical now. As soon as they got their numbers up, oh yeah, we're radical. Oh yeah,
[16:58.720 --> 17:04.400]  we hail the Wahhabist. Take out the evil European Nazis, he says, even though it's the Muslims
[17:04.400 --> 17:09.600]  work for the Nazis. So that's what's going on. It's the EU globalist. It's the Islamist. It's
[17:09.600 --> 17:15.120]  communist China. It's the big mega banks all against America, all against the UK, all against Japan,
[17:15.120 --> 17:22.880]  all against South Korea. And they're just running around in everybody's face, bullying as hardcore
[17:22.880 --> 17:27.440]  as they can. There it is. Holy wars will soon begin in Europe. Turkey, foreign minister issues,
[17:27.440 --> 17:34.960]  grave warning to EU. Let more Muslims in, give us billions of dollars or we'll burn your cities down.
[17:34.960 --> 17:38.160]  And then they start rioting because the Europeans have been gelded. They've been trained to lay down
[17:38.160 --> 17:42.160]  and roll over. You bring in a giant hardcore third world population that's used to all this
[17:42.160 --> 17:46.160]  milling around and killing and killing each other and they're waving their flags in your country
[17:46.160 --> 17:52.640]  and they're saying we're taking over, you get ready. And Steve Bannon recognizes that and says
[17:52.640 --> 17:57.200]  Islam is the main threat. Ideologically, you name it, communist China is the next threat,
[17:57.200 --> 18:01.760]  militarily the number one threat. Not the Russians. The Russians are battling Islam.
[18:03.680 --> 18:10.480]  They just got bombed on Monday in St. Petersburg. So horrifying photos of these little children,
[18:10.480 --> 18:16.640]  so dear, hit with nerve gas. You can pull up all the articles going back four years ago where they
[18:16.640 --> 18:23.040]  continually got caught launching these in close quarters inside cities and then the news CNN
[18:23.040 --> 18:27.840]  announcing that Assad did it. Assad said we would do no such thing. We gave up our chemical weapons
[18:27.840 --> 18:31.120]  three years ago under a deal. Remember, the Russians came and transferred them out with
[18:31.120 --> 18:38.320]  inspectors, but we wouldn't do that anyways. It's not even militarily useful. All it does is overthrow us.
[18:38.320 --> 18:47.440]  But Trump's being told do this and they'll stop saying you're a Russian. Do this. They're never
[18:47.440 --> 18:52.240]  going to stop. They're the globalists. They're the threat to America. They're never going to stop
[18:52.240 --> 18:55.840]  these committee hearings and all this made up crud when they're the ones with the connections of
[18:55.840 --> 18:59.920]  the Russians. They're never going to stop all their calls for violence to kill Trump and his family.
[19:01.440 --> 19:04.880]  And then if we say anything back, oh my God, we're the devil. We need to be arrested even
[19:04.880 --> 19:10.960]  if it's tongue in cheek. We're going to continue to pound the globalists in the Info War. Violence
[19:10.960 --> 19:15.120]  is not the answer. We're winning intellectually. As I've always said, offensive violence is never
[19:15.120 --> 19:20.160]  the answer. We need to information warfare with the truth, though, pound these lies that CNN has
[19:20.160 --> 19:24.880]  a long history of war propaganda about made up WMDs, about throwing babies out of incubators
[19:24.880 --> 19:30.160]  in Kuwait. It's all come out. But look at this poor little baby. You know, I have children. This
[19:30.160 --> 19:35.520]  hurts my heart. Ron Paul, chemical weapons attack in Syria, likely a false flag. We're going to play
[19:35.520 --> 19:39.920]  the clip when we come back. United Nations, the whole emergency meeting after a suspected chemical
[19:39.920 --> 19:47.200]  attack in Syria. We are compelled to take our own action of UN fails in Syria, U.S. envoy.

[19:53.600 --> 19:59.840]  It's unbelievable. It's unbelievable. And of course, this will push us into war with Russia.

[24:04.160 --> 24:09.520]  Welcome back. President Trump meets today with a Chinese dictator they call a president.
[24:09.520 --> 24:14.880]  But I'm not supposed to say that. That's politically incorrect. That's right. Don't
[24:14.880 --> 24:24.160]  criticize dictators. And on top of that, we've got a war brewing. If Russia doesn't back down
[24:24.160 --> 24:31.440]  and leave Syria, if the United States decides to take out Assad, who didn't start the war,
[24:31.440 --> 24:36.480]  who got invaded by al-Qaeda forces. And our own Pentagon has testified to Congress,
[24:36.480 --> 24:40.560]  I knew about this back when it was classified from our sources, that it came out years later,
[24:40.560 --> 24:48.720]  that 95% of the forces are radical, Sunni-based. And Syrian girl, her family was part of the
[24:48.720 --> 24:52.560]  ruling party before that. They don't even like Assad. They got kicked out by Assad's dad.
[24:54.000 --> 24:57.920]  She's an Australia. She's very learned and smart. She's been on national TV in Australia and
[24:57.920 --> 25:01.600]  other places. She's been on here many times. She goes by Syrian girl, but she's written this
[25:01.600 --> 25:05.520]  article in her full name on infowars.com about the chemical attack, saying it's clearly a false
[25:05.520 --> 25:14.800]  flag first. We broke that yesterday. And she talks about the fact that, I mean, it is Sunni.
[25:16.160 --> 25:21.360]  And now with Saudi Arabia getting control of Sunni Islam, it's just completely radicalized now
[25:21.360 --> 25:27.600]  and completely murderous. And she'll tell you what the military says is true. 90% plus percent are
[25:27.600 --> 25:33.600]  radical Sunnis. And they're not going to let Alawites, Shiites, Christians live in peace.
[25:33.600 --> 25:36.880]  Folks, they're going to kill everybody. And they're going to make women wear hoods over their heads.
[25:36.880 --> 25:43.280]  And that's who we're going to back. You can't do that. There is not a good, moderate opposition
[25:43.280 --> 25:49.600]  group. That's why Russia keeps saying, what are you going to do? Kick ISIS out. Then Assad will
[25:49.600 --> 25:54.080]  leave, stabilize the country. And then we, who are in control of the country, have made deals with
[25:54.080 --> 25:58.480]  Assad that will create a new coalition government. Globals don't want that. They want another failed
[25:58.480 --> 26:04.400]  state. And that's why the Pentagon actually has people in it that cared like General Flynn and
[26:04.400 --> 26:09.680]  others and General Dempsey who said, we're not going to be part of this. We're not going to put
[26:09.680 --> 26:15.120]  the most radical Muslims in control in one of the oldest Christian countries in the world previously.
[26:17.360 --> 26:21.680]  Because so much of the population are crypto Christians, secret Christians.
[26:21.680 --> 26:25.360]  Let's go to Dr. Ron Paul on his television program talking about this.
[26:25.360 --> 26:29.600]  Things were going along reasonably well for the conditions.
[26:29.600 --> 26:37.440]  You know, Trump says, let the Syrians decide who should run their country. And peace talks were
[26:37.440 --> 26:46.960]  breaking out. And Al Qaeda and ISIS were on the run on maybe defeated. So it was like,
[26:47.520 --> 26:52.480]  you know, in spite of their problems with this foreign policy, it looked like there was some
[26:52.480 --> 26:58.640]  benefit, but it looks like maybe somebody didn't like that. So there had to be an episode. And
[26:58.640 --> 27:06.640]  the blame now is that we can't let that happen because it looks like it might benefit Assad.
[27:06.640 --> 27:12.800]  So Assad, they claim, now went and released gas to kill a bunch of people. But Daniel,
[27:12.800 --> 27:18.320]  we might not have much of a job here today, because I looked at the New York Times to find out
[27:18.320 --> 27:22.880]  to get the explanation. And they said, worst chemical attack in years in Syria,
[27:22.880 --> 27:29.440]  U.S. blames Assad. So it's all over and done with. But not quite so easy, is it? What happened four
[27:29.440 --> 27:37.520]  years ago in 2013, you know, this whole thing about crossing the red line. And ever since then,
[27:38.320 --> 27:43.360]  the neocons have been yelling and screaming, even part of the administration is still yelling and
[27:43.360 --> 27:49.040]  screaming about Assad using poison gases on his people four years ago. Not quite true.
[27:49.040 --> 27:54.400]  Yeah, it was never, it was never proven. In fact, in the U.N. official Carla Del Ponte said that
[27:54.400 --> 27:59.120]  attack was most likely done by the rebels based on the evidence. But here you have Nikki Haley,
[27:59.120 --> 28:04.240]  U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., almost as we speak, literally at the U.N. Security Council, saying,
[28:04.240 --> 28:09.120]  quote, we know Assad has used chemical weapons before. It's not true. It has never been proven
[28:09.120 --> 28:12.640]  that he has. He may have. We do know that the rebels have used them. That has been proven.
[28:12.640 --> 28:20.000]  And who would benefit? It makes no sense. Even if you were totally separate from this and take
[28:20.000 --> 28:25.040]  no size of this and you were just an analyst, it doesn't make any sense for Assad in these
[28:25.040 --> 28:31.760]  conditions to all of a sudden use poison gases. It's I think it's a zero chance that he would
[28:31.760 --> 28:36.800]  have done this, you know, deliberately. You know why they want to shut down the free independent
[28:36.800 --> 28:42.160]  internet? How are they going to compete with a show like that or this one where we have memories
[28:42.160 --> 28:47.040]  and we show you articles and the U.N. admitting it and everything. In fact, the U.N. specifically
[28:47.040 --> 28:50.640]  tested the chemicals so do other governments. That's when the British pulled out and had a vote
[28:50.640 --> 28:56.560]  and said, we're not doing this. Saudi Arabia was connected to a nerve gas attack using mortars.
[28:57.680 --> 29:03.920]  And then they were, their Wahhabis wanted to be rock stars, though, so they videotaped themselves
[29:03.920 --> 29:08.400]  launching the chemical attacks, gibbering about it and uploaded it the same day.
[29:08.400 --> 29:16.000]  While our media was blaming Assad, he's going, why would I use chemical weapons on a populated
[29:16.000 --> 29:20.960]  area and turn the whole population against myself? And you say if I use chemical weapons,
[29:20.960 --> 29:24.240]  you're going to hit me out of a clear blue sky. I've never threatened to use chemicals, would
[29:24.240 --> 29:27.760]  never use chemicals. All of a sudden you're like, if you use chemicals, we're going to invade. You're
[29:27.760 --> 29:33.440]  like, okay, well, I'm not going to. Oh my gosh, chemicals on the one year anniversary of Obama's
[29:33.440 --> 29:38.800]  red line. I mean, how transparent, and then they get caught doing it a whole bunch of times.
[29:40.000 --> 29:43.520]  I said four or five times, I was looking, it's more than 11 times they've been caught
[29:44.240 --> 29:48.480]  using chemical weapons on video and bragging about it. And then they blame Assad. I mean,
[29:48.480 --> 29:56.960]  it's just, and now they want war with Russia. Oh my gosh. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[29:56.960 --> 30:05.920]  While the swamp is competitive in the political battle, it does seem the cultural swamp is being
[30:05.920 --> 30:11.680]  drained. Shia LaBeouf's most recent film, Man Down, had a blockbuster opening day with a huge ticket
[30:11.680 --> 30:16.640]  sale. Yes, one ticket. Since opening night last weekend, ticket sales have totaled a whopping
[30:16.640 --> 30:21.440]  three. He's had more flag stolen than ticket sales. So Shia's childish antics on the streets
[30:21.440 --> 30:26.160]  earned him more attention than his actual job. Meanwhile, InStyle magazine had to publish a
[30:26.160 --> 30:31.920]  story to boost Amy Schumer's crushed ego headline reading, dudes, Amy Schumer is not too vulgar.
[30:31.920 --> 30:37.200]  You're just sexist. So now if a man doesn't like a woman, it's because he's sexist. How dare you
[30:37.200 --> 30:40.880]  not like my strong, proud woman who breaks all the social paradigms by trying to be elegant and
[30:40.880 --> 30:46.000]  abhorrent at the same time. See women can do and be anything. Yes, including too vulgar. I ran a
[30:46.000 --> 30:51.440]  series of polls on Twitter called who's the worst and Amy Schumer one. The people have spoken.
[30:51.440 --> 30:56.000]  Amy Schumer is the worst. But if the left wants her to be their poster child, go ahead.
[30:56.000 --> 31:00.320]  We will keep winning the culture war for info wars.com. This is Owen Schreuer.
[31:26.000 --> 31:30.720]  co workers, your family, your children to the best job you can to purify your air.
[31:30.720 --> 31:36.080]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or
[31:36.080 --> 31:42.160]  avoid most toxic effects for themselves. The general public doesn't. The Alexa pure breeze
[31:42.160 --> 31:48.480]  will be a steal at $300, $400, $500. One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[31:48.480 --> 31:52.240]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more
[31:52.240 --> 31:58.080]  expensive filters that didn't do as good a job. Find out why this system is so revolutionary today
[31:58.080 --> 32:04.720]  in info wars store.com. Today, we call it bone broth. And for thousands of years,
[32:04.720 --> 32:10.080]  our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diet, a process junk.
[32:10.080 --> 32:15.840]  We are now introducing caveman by info wars.com, the ultimate and true paleo nutrition with bone
[32:15.840 --> 32:22.240]  broth, turmeric root, shaga mushroom and seven total primal super foods in a single great tasting
[32:22.240 --> 32:27.200]  formula caveman. It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization
[32:27.200 --> 32:31.280]  that are our superior ancestors. And we need to do everything we can to recapture them.
[32:31.280 --> 32:35.840]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal. You use the meat for sustenance,
[32:35.840 --> 32:41.520]  the fat for cooking, but you use the bones for strength from the outside structure full of
[32:41.520 --> 32:46.000]  minerals and key co factors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body. This is the
[32:46.000 --> 32:51.280]  engine of the life essence. I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as
[32:51.280 --> 32:55.680]  they'll try to get back to that essence that made us what we were. And this is a big part of it.
[32:55.680 --> 32:59.280]  I know you're going to want to check out caveman ultimate paleo formula for yourself in
[32:59.280 --> 33:19.600]  enforce life.com today. We now take you live to the central Texas command center
[33:19.600 --> 33:31.680]  and the heart of the resistance. It's Alex Jones and who would benefit. It makes no sense
[33:31.680 --> 33:37.200]  that even if you were totally separate from this and take no sides of this and you were just an
[33:37.200 --> 33:42.480]  analyst, it doesn't make any sense for sawed in these conditions to all of a sudden use poison
[33:42.480 --> 33:49.760]  gases. It's I think it's zero chance that he would have done this, you know, deliberately.
[33:50.880 --> 33:55.040]  And he goes on to say it looks like a false flag. It's on info wars.com Ron Paul chemical weapons
[33:55.040 --> 34:00.080]  attack in Syria, likely a false flag. Of course, former Marine Corps officer and fighter bomber
[34:00.080 --> 34:07.440]  pilot Joel Scousen came on the broadcast and said look clearly false flag. They've been caught
[34:07.440 --> 34:12.960]  doing it many other times and Ron Paul and others go over all that. We've been breaking this since
[34:12.960 --> 34:20.960]  day one. But now see they're telling Trump, no, we know it's them with no proof. CNN says so that
[34:20.960 --> 34:30.080]  the brass tell him. And so we've got to go in. And Haley's running around saber rattling with
[34:30.080 --> 34:35.520]  Russia and everybody else. And then she gets booed because she's not pro war enough. That's the new
[34:35.520 --> 34:41.680]  liberal thing. Because the Democrats are the anti Russians and the Democrats are the anti
[34:41.680 --> 34:46.880]  communist and the Democrats are the anti radical Muslims and the radical Muslims are Assad because
[34:46.880 --> 34:54.160]  he isn't the radical Muslim. And the EU's ally with Turkey overrunning Europe and openly admitting
[34:54.160 --> 34:58.000]  they're doing it now. We were talking about Turkey getting ready to muscle in a few years ago. They
[34:58.000 --> 35:04.400]  just say it now. Wow. This is an incredible time to be alive. I'm here to tell you and that's why
[35:04.400 --> 35:09.760]  Bannon's off the National Security Council because he reportedly stories on info wars.com
[35:09.760 --> 35:13.680]  clashed with them and said this is crazy. This is everything we said we wouldn't do.
[35:15.520 --> 35:20.560]  But then Trump wants to believe the military, but they're political. The guys at that level.
[35:20.560 --> 35:23.200]  We don't have General Dempsey anymore. We don't have
[35:25.840 --> 35:30.800]  Flynn anymore in the military. You've got this crowd the Republicans told you to get because
[35:30.800 --> 35:36.880]  they'd be your friends. They defend America. They're the Hawks. And sure enough,
[35:38.640 --> 35:42.080]  Chuck E. Schumer was just on Fox News earlier. I saw the clip during the break
[35:42.080 --> 35:48.720]  saying that Trump looks like a 98 pound weakling to China. A US senator undermining the president
[35:48.720 --> 35:55.120]  the day he meets with the Chinese communist president dictator and just undermining the
[35:55.120 --> 35:59.840]  stock market and undermining confidence and undermining just everything they do trying to
[35:59.840 --> 36:04.480]  bring the country down, trying to discredit nationalism and Trump's playing politics.
[36:04.480 --> 36:08.960]  He knows what's going on. I'm not even approving of it. I'm just saying I can sit back and I can
[36:08.960 --> 36:13.440]  tell you he knows the public isn't fully filled in all the facts. They need to have their memory
[36:13.440 --> 36:18.960]  refreshed. And so in comes Rand Paul. In comes everybody else. In comes Ted Cruz saying you
[36:18.960 --> 36:23.680]  know this is al-Qaeda. We're about to back. There's a reason we didn't take out Assad before. It
[36:23.680 --> 36:29.600]  wasn't for love lost. It wasn't because we love Assad or he's perfect. It's because what you're
[36:29.600 --> 36:36.960]  going to put in is 50 times worse. And then our military who had patriots in at the highest levels
[36:36.960 --> 36:42.720]  at that time told Obama and everybody else this this came out in the news. They'll have a clear
[36:42.720 --> 36:47.520]  path out of the Middle East to invade Turkey, break, take down Turkey if your gun isn't already
[36:47.520 --> 36:53.120]  going to side with radical Islam and then totally invade Europe. See Europe began to fall at
[36:53.120 --> 37:03.520]  Constantinople. Istanbul, their capital was formerly the head of the Byzantine Roman Empire,
[37:03.520 --> 37:11.360]  the Eastern Empire. The Western Empire and Rome fell in 410. The Byzantine Empire fell a lot
[37:11.360 --> 37:17.440]  later to the Muslims, to an invasion, to a naval bombardment, to months of war, to siege.
[37:17.440 --> 37:25.360]  The men were put to death, the women into sex slavery and sold worldwide, all throughout the
[37:25.360 --> 37:32.160]  old world. And now we see the same thing happening and our traitor government's going along with it.
[37:32.160 --> 37:39.200]  It is crazy. So I'm about 99% sure that Trump now is going to start saying well I am concerned about
[37:39.200 --> 37:43.360]  the gas, knowing they'll say oh you're siding with Assad, you're for gas and kids. You know we,
[37:43.360 --> 37:50.000]  well I'm changing my mind on this now. Let me see and then income the surrogates to put out the
[37:50.000 --> 37:55.040]  truth of what's happening. Hopefully the public remembers all this from 3, 4, 5 years ago when
[37:55.040 --> 38:01.600]  an old transpire goes oh yeah that's why we're not backing overthrowing Assad. And the Russians,
[38:01.600 --> 38:05.200]  I would disagree with them in a second if they didn't have a good policy. It's in their neighborhood,
[38:05.200 --> 38:18.400]  they've been allied with Syria for 50 years. But the problem is that all they're saying is just,
[38:18.400 --> 38:22.720]  just, just get al-Qaeda out, get ISIS out and then Assad will step aside, we can have a coalition
[38:22.720 --> 38:27.360]  government. We want stability here. That's not what they want. And so now Trump is looking at his
[38:27.360 --> 38:32.000]  options and now the drumbeat begins. Will he do something? Will he stand up against it? Will he
[38:32.000 --> 38:46.640]  take action? Will Trump do the right thing? Which means another war, another lie, another fraud,
[38:46.640 --> 38:52.400]  to go take out some moderate, put somebody in 20, 30, 40, 50 times worse and then that's on Europe's
[38:52.400 --> 38:59.760]  border. Another big piece of the puzzle, another big piece of the big board in the big risk game
[38:59.760 --> 39:05.840]  taken by the Islamist. Paul Watson has put out his big special report on the pedophile empire.
[39:06.880 --> 39:12.960]  The headline is pedophiles rule the world. It's 13 minutes, 50 seconds long. It's very powerful.
[39:12.960 --> 39:18.480]  It's all documented, admitted, giant pedophile rings and Satanist rings and serial killers,
[39:18.480 --> 39:23.360]  kidnapping kids out of their backyards to deliver them to the pedophile rings. It's all convictions.
[39:23.360 --> 39:31.920]  It's all confirmed. I'm going to retweet it at infowars.com. At Real Alex Jones. I want everybody
[39:31.920 --> 39:37.840]  to spread this video because they're trying to block it. In fact, last night it wasn't even letting
[39:37.840 --> 39:42.800]  me into it. It was saying age restriction when there's nothing in it vulgar, nothing in it
[39:42.800 --> 39:47.200]  profane, just nothing but mainstream news articles and admissions of giant pedophile grids.
[39:47.200 --> 39:55.680]  We're going to get to that sometime today, but I do have so many guests coming on,
[39:55.680 --> 39:59.920]  like Michael Snyder, Paul Craig Roberts, Dr. Group and others, but I will get to it. So
[39:59.920 --> 40:06.480]  that's that stack on what's happening in Syria. It could trigger, will probably trigger a much larger
[40:06.480 --> 40:16.560]  war if we actually start bombarding the recognized government of Syria, which is a quasi-dictatorship.
[40:16.560 --> 40:21.840]  I'm not defending it. It's an oligarchy, just like the EU is. So they can't shake their finger.
[40:21.840 --> 40:26.800]  It's unelected. Unelected board runs it, just like China. And so
[40:29.760 --> 40:37.360]  the Russians have said they'll defend if there is an invasion or if there is an attack
[40:38.160 --> 40:43.360]  unless they talk to President Trump and he gives them some other option. Russia challenges Trump
[40:43.360 --> 40:49.280]  to say what he would do about Syria because they've told Russia, this is your fault. You need to fix
[40:49.280 --> 40:54.400]  this. And Russia said, we're not the ones that ran the invasion six years ago. We're not the ones
[40:54.400 --> 40:57.760]  that backed all these radical Islamic groups. We didn't destabilize the whole Middle East.
[40:57.760 --> 41:05.360]  It's on our border. We're trying to stop this. And then again, I guess the different Republican
[41:05.360 --> 41:09.360]  committee members, there's a whole bunch of names that have had all these meetings
[41:09.360 --> 41:13.280]  where they get up there and say, Alex Jones is run by the Russians.
[41:14.240 --> 41:18.160]  Oh, because I don't want to have war with the Russians and be on the side of Islam.
[41:20.400 --> 41:26.160]  It's very insulting to sit there because I support Senator Paul and I support Dr. Paul and I support
[41:26.160 --> 41:30.800]  my own research and Colonel Schaefer and all these other military experts we have. Congress
[41:30.800 --> 41:35.440]  knows we're turning this country over to the worst people on the planet. Yeah, worse to the North
[41:35.440 --> 41:42.240]  Koreans, worse to the North Korean Communist. What is going on? Meanwhile, let's shift gears.
[41:42.240 --> 41:51.120]  Nunez steps aside from the Russia probe. While the ethics committee that's had complaints
[41:51.120 --> 41:56.800]  filed in it by the usual suspects, Adam Schiff and others, clears him of it.
[41:56.800 --> 42:07.040]  He went and saw the very same intelligence that Schiff just went and saw. But they're saying he
[42:07.040 --> 42:11.680]  wasn't allowed to tell the public that he saw intelligence that Trump was being spied on.
[42:11.680 --> 42:17.200]  They're claiming that's a leak when it's not. But then the Democrats are the ones leaking
[42:17.200 --> 42:26.240]  all over the place. It's amazing. So everything that they have accused Trump of they've done,
[42:26.240 --> 42:31.120]  but Trump just keeps thinking if he is open about everything and nice and treats them well that
[42:31.120 --> 42:34.560]  they're going to then clear him of everything. They're never going to clear Trump of anything.
[42:34.560 --> 42:39.040]  They say he's not the president. They say he should be removed. They say all the place that
[42:39.040 --> 42:46.080]  he needs to be killed. Top Democrats say we need to organize his downfall. They're calling for
[42:47.200 --> 42:52.800]  coups against the president. They're calling for COG to be used against him. They're calling for
[42:52.800 --> 43:00.160]  the White House to be blown up. And nothing's being done to them when they're clearly violating the law.
[43:03.840 --> 43:08.720]  It's amazing. And they don't ever retract what they've said and say, oh, I didn't mean it, whatever.
[43:09.600 --> 43:14.240]  Because I've said stuff like, you call me a Russian or whatever, say I'm a traitor. I'll
[43:14.240 --> 43:20.960]  punch you in the nose. That's rhetorical. That's hyperbole. And I've said that's hyperbole. When
[43:20.960 --> 43:25.840]  we say it's an information war, we're going to crush you, all that kind of stuff. We've always
[43:25.840 --> 43:32.720]  promoted non-violence offensively. We've always promoted information war. That's the name of the
[43:32.720 --> 43:36.960]  show. But again, there's branding everywhere that the Republicans are the ones that are violent.
[43:36.960 --> 43:40.560]  The Republicans are the ones that, out in Berkeley, started the whole Milo riot.
[43:41.920 --> 43:45.760]  It's the Republicans. They're the ones. It's the patriots. They're the ones. They're the ones.
[43:45.760 --> 43:48.960]  And then all the WikiLeaks come out and it's the Democratic Party starting riots,
[43:48.960 --> 43:53.280]  starting fights and calling for it. Just like they funded the Arab Spring and the Civil War
[43:53.280 --> 43:59.040]  and the overthrow of the Ukrainian government that was elected. And just like they've been caught now,
[43:59.680 --> 44:07.440]  George Soros Connected Group is on infowars.com. Funded Group reports Soros Link Group
[44:07.440 --> 44:11.120]  behind chemical attack in Syria. Chemical attack has all the hallmarks of a false flag,
[44:11.120 --> 44:13.440]  which they've tried a whole bunch of other times and have been caught doing.
[44:13.440 --> 44:20.640]  But let's get to this since I mentioned it. CNN has child read off a script to push for war
[44:21.760 --> 44:28.160]  in Syria to oust Assad. This is the most amazing video where they don't even hide the fact
[44:29.840 --> 44:36.080]  that they've got children reading off teleprompters about what they saw as the eyewitnesses.
[44:36.080 --> 44:41.120]  I saw the planes and the missiles and then they could not breathe. Oh, please,
[44:41.120 --> 44:51.360]  please Trump help us. And most of these people are families that have been brought in to Syria.
[44:55.360 --> 45:03.280]  Sunni settlers going into one of the only partially Shiite Muslim countries in the world.
[45:03.280 --> 45:11.440]  Think about that. But just like they had the daughter of the PR firm go and say she saw the
[45:11.440 --> 45:15.840]  babies and the incubators, she'd never even turned out been to Kuwait. Later came out in
[45:15.840 --> 45:19.680]  mainstream news. It was totally fake. And then they were stomping on the babies out of the incubators.
[45:19.680 --> 45:23.600]  Well, this is this is better than that. We've got real kids that died in a real chemical attack.
[45:23.600 --> 45:27.200]  The media probably say that I said that no kids died. No, it's terrible. It's terrible war.
[45:27.200 --> 45:35.200]  Crossies on both sides. But who started it? And who are those groups? This is no brainer.
[45:35.200 --> 45:39.680]  And Rand Paul is right. Trump needs to really pull back and think about who we're about to back
[45:39.680 --> 45:42.960]  if we do this and then what's going to come out of it and understand the media is still going to
[45:42.960 --> 45:47.840]  blame you for it because you didn't start it and you didn't do it. But they've already hung it around
[45:47.840 --> 45:57.760]  your neck and you've already come out and said Syria is now my problem. Syria is your problem when
[45:57.760 --> 46:06.240]  Obama started it. Okay. The media says Obamacare is Trump's fault now. See, this is the upside
[46:06.240 --> 46:10.240]  down planet. So if you're a radio listener, I'll describe this, but the articles on infowars.com
[46:10.240 --> 46:13.600]  if you want to see it, this has to get out there folks because this is what CNN has been caught
[46:13.600 --> 46:22.720]  doing about aluminum tubes, yellow cake, Nigerian uranium, everything. And now they're back and I
[46:22.720 --> 46:27.200]  saw it all yesterday in this morning. The little kids clearly all saying the same thing about what
[46:27.200 --> 46:37.200]  they saw and what they did. I mean, this is ridiculous. So here's the sad little clip. Here it is.
[46:37.200 --> 46:46.880]  Banna, do you blame President Assad for this? Yes. What is your message to President Assad?
[46:49.040 --> 47:04.080]  I am very sad. A lot of died and no one helped them. The world is watching. The world doesn't
[47:04.080 --> 47:15.600]  do anything. What do you want the world to do? I want to stop the war and I want the children
[47:16.240 --> 47:27.440]  of Syria play and go to school, live in peace. We can, together, we can help them. Together,
[47:27.440 --> 47:34.960]  we can save them. Banna, when you saw the video and the pictures of what happened
[47:34.960 --> 47:47.200]  in Syria this week, what did you think? I am very sad about this 100 Syrian workers in Syria.
[47:48.640 --> 47:52.400]  By the way, I forgot to add, we'll put the London Guardian article up on screen.
[47:52.400 --> 47:59.440]  This little girl, undisputedly, works for CNN basically and was, quote,
[47:59.440 --> 48:05.040]  successfully evacuated over a year ago. Let's put that London Guardian article.
[48:05.040 --> 48:10.800]  Where is Banna, girl who tweeted from Aleppo, is safely evacuated? The Guardian, Turkish NGO,
[48:10.800 --> 48:17.280]  tweets picture of seven-year-old aid worker and says family have been rescued from besieged city.
[48:17.280 --> 48:30.320]  But CNN is telling us that this is, that's Monday, December 19th, 2016, so I guess five
[48:30.320 --> 48:35.680]  months ago. So there you go. And it just goes on and on. And of course, we have famous stuff in
[48:35.680 --> 48:42.400]  Syria where they've even got fake gunfire going off and the guy goes, I go live now, I start gunfire.
[48:42.400 --> 48:48.880]  Remember all those clips? I mean, we can pull up, it's on YouTube, babies in incubator, fake
[48:48.880 --> 48:57.680]  testimony, fake, fake, go for one testimony, baby in incubator, fake testimony. There's even
[48:57.680 --> 49:02.240]  a 60 minutes piece, the other is the go for lie, babies thrown on incubators. And it's the very
[49:02.240 --> 49:07.280]  same thing. I was there as they pulled them out, they stomped them and then they do it.
[49:07.280 --> 49:14.400]  Turned out, lived in the U.S. boarding school, wasn't even in Kuwait. The daughter of the top PR
[49:14.400 --> 49:22.000]  company. I'm not saying Saddam Hussein was a good guy, but it was lies that brought us into that
[49:22.000 --> 49:27.760]  to then overthrow him and put something in even worse. Again, why? To turn the Middle East into
[49:27.760 --> 49:32.480]  a hellhole, even worse than it is, run by the worst people. This is a destabilization program
[49:32.480 --> 49:35.920]  of the Middle East, just like they're doing it to us. The globalists hate the Muslims,
[49:35.920 --> 49:39.040]  the globalists hate the Christians, the globalists hate everybody. They're technocrats.
[49:39.040 --> 49:43.600]  Are they using Islam because it's so barbarous to take down the West? Absolutely. But I actually
[49:43.600 --> 49:47.840]  care about the Muslims of the Middle East, even though a lot of them are brainwashed and hate
[49:47.840 --> 49:54.160]  my Christian guts. The point is the facts are the facts. Every regime where women can go to
[49:54.160 --> 49:58.960]  college and don't wear hoods over their heads and have a good industrial system and have a
[49:58.960 --> 50:03.920]  tourism is destroyed by our government and others funding the most radical Muslims on the planet
[50:03.920 --> 50:10.400]  to invade them. That's why Rand Paul's urging Trump not to take military action in Syria in
[50:10.400 --> 50:14.960]  full wars.com. I don't want to support people who hate our country. We need to have the military
[50:14.960 --> 50:20.400]  come out again and say, I don't want to be al-Qaeda slash ISIS's air force. I was all for our
[50:20.400 --> 50:24.400]  military being there, taking out ISIS. We've almost beaten them. They're driving them out.
[50:24.400 --> 50:28.960]  McCain's mad. He flies over there a month ago. You can just see the setup for this. He flies back.
[50:28.960 --> 50:34.480]  Boom. Right when ISIS is getting ready to give up, right when they're starting to leave,
[50:34.480 --> 50:38.480]  right when they're getting their butt kicked in Iraq, right when it's all happening magically,
[50:39.280 --> 50:44.640]  Assad does the one thing that'll get him thrown out. And he's denying it, of course,
[50:44.640 --> 50:48.720]  saying he hasn't done it. Fatty, fatty, boom, boom. Let's put that back on screen.
[50:50.480 --> 50:55.440]  North Korean threatens war with U.S. after Senator John McCain called, that's about Kim Jong-un,
[50:55.440 --> 50:59.040]  crazy fat kid. Wow. Finally, John McCain tells the truth.
[51:01.040 --> 51:05.600]  They say you can't take on the man and win. That one small company doesn't stand a chance against
[51:05.600 --> 51:11.040]  the corporate behemoths with all their money and lawyers. But they don't know Harry's. How's Harry's

[54:33.440 --> 54:42.800]  The world is on the precipice of massive wars in the South China Sea on the Korean peninsula
[54:42.800 --> 54:48.960]  that sticks out in the middle of it, in the Middle East. And we have economic warfare
[54:48.960 --> 54:57.360]  taking place against the UK for Brexit. We have military threats by Yonker, the unelected
[54:57.360 --> 55:06.400]  head of the EU, the EU dictator. And we have calls to shut down the true and independent
[55:06.400 --> 55:12.000]  press in this country. The Democrats organizing violence, the overthrow of the president everywhere,
[55:12.000 --> 55:16.800]  and even CBS News admitting that Soros groups are funding Black Lives Matter that's calling
[55:16.800 --> 55:23.680]  for the killing of police. But all that's okay. But they want to ban our speech, they say it's
[55:23.680 --> 55:30.800]  hurtful or mean. And they take it out of context, edit it together to then deceive their dumbdown

[56:00.160 --> 56:07.440]  on infowars.com, pedophiles rule the world. I apologize if Watson that needs to go viral.
[56:07.440 --> 56:10.880]  We really should do a special report. I just mentioned this little girl who's they've had
[56:10.880 --> 56:16.080]  on CNN for years, who was evacuated out of Syria last year. And then there she is hugging Ergun
[56:18.080 --> 56:24.080]  Banna, all-bit seven-year-old Syrian girl meets Turkey's president Ergun. But then we're seeing
[56:24.080 --> 56:31.520]  on the news, she's in Turkey telling the president what she'd like to see him do.
[56:31.520 --> 56:36.320]  This is just crazy propaganda.
[56:39.840 --> 56:46.720]  CNN, it's been released the last decade, routinely receives millions of dollars per
[56:46.720 --> 56:54.720]  program per quarter to produce pro-Islamic news. So you ask, why are they so anti-American,
[56:54.720 --> 57:00.080]  so pro-Islamic? They're paid massive amounts of money. You can search into that. Those different
[57:00.080 --> 57:07.440]  governments, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, they just pump money into it for little special reports.
[57:09.200 --> 57:13.040]  We're funded by listeners and viewers like you. And that's why I want to encourage everybody
[57:13.040 --> 57:18.880]  to go to infowarsstore.com today for the first time in four years of our X2
[57:19.600 --> 57:26.400]  true nation iodine, the good halogen. We're running out. Might have some of the last runs

[57:44.800 --> 57:49.040]  support the broadcast. It's got turmeric and so much more in it. Check it out for yourself. It is
[57:49.040 --> 57:55.360]  an amazing formula with bee pollen, chaga mushroom, and so much more. And it tastes great as well.
[57:55.360 --> 58:03.680]  Also, just briefly, I saw an article today attacking us. It was on Vox. I read most of
[58:03.680 --> 58:12.960]  this long article about Jones and Vince mold and fungus crisis and then sells a pill for it.
[58:13.760 --> 58:18.800]  That's like saying I invented Band-Aid because I invented cuts. They admit all the candida and
[58:18.800 --> 58:22.960]  stuff's out of control. The big fancy clinics all over have so much systems what we sell,
[58:22.960 --> 58:29.520]  by the way, sold out. We also sell high quality probiotics. Everybody knows probiotics good.
[58:30.880 --> 58:35.280]  But again, they're just attacking us on every front and just act like we're insane.
[58:36.640 --> 58:42.240]  I mean, it's well known what's going on in the gut with the overgrowth of the fungus and all the
[58:42.240 --> 58:48.400]  rest of it because the pesticides kill the good bacteria and then it creates a vacuum they breathe
[58:48.400 --> 58:54.400]  in. I mean, not a group you developed living defense for us. It took you over a year to do it.
[58:54.400 --> 58:59.760]  Why is this so good? Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares
[58:59.760 --> 59:05.520]  me the most. I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages
[59:05.520 --> 59:11.840]  in my system. But right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful
[59:11.840 --> 59:17.680]  to your body that lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees spreading disease
[59:17.680 --> 59:22.400]  around. We have biological warfare going on everywhere. These are all parasites. Tell us
[59:22.400 --> 59:25.920]  about all the stuff I said. There's so many things that are in it. You have the neem in there. You
[59:25.920 --> 59:31.600]  have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood. I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least
[59:31.600 --> 59:35.360]  twice a year. All right. Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[59:35.360 --> 59:39.680]  It just came back in yesterday. Living Defense, infowarslife.com. And folks, you can't lose
[59:39.680 --> 59:45.360]  full of stuff that's great for your body, period. And you support the broadcast infowarslife.com.
[59:45.360 --> 59:48.960]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center. Thank you so much for all your work, sir,
[59:48.960 --> 1:00:17.760]  and this great product. You're listening to the Alex Jones show. Rallying Patriots worldwide
[1:00:17.760 --> 1:00:23.200]  in defense of human liberty. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:25.600 --> 1:00:31.920]  G.J. Peng supposedly arriving today. That's what CNN said the time is dictator. I thought it was
[1:00:31.920 --> 1:00:35.840]  tomorrow, but we're going to have breaking news for you on that front coming up in the start of
[1:00:35.840 --> 1:00:46.320]  the next segment. I really cannot break down enough to you how unbelievable the global situation is.
[1:00:46.320 --> 1:00:51.120]  Michael Snyder, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, and others are going to be joining us. The Liberals,
[1:00:51.120 --> 1:00:55.840]  I think, are really desperate. They just launched a false flag. Ron Paul believes, I believe. The
[1:00:55.840 --> 1:00:59.840]  evidence is overwhelming. The al-Qaeda folks have been caught doing it before. You know,
[1:00:59.840 --> 1:01:05.280]  the rebranded is ISIS. Al-Nusra, the good rebels in Syria has seen and calls them.
[1:01:06.640 --> 1:01:10.400]  I've been saying false flag, false flag. I've been saying a lot. Look for one in Syria because
[1:01:10.400 --> 1:01:14.080]  John McCain was just there a month ago. In fact, when that came out that he'd snuck over there.
[1:01:14.080 --> 1:01:17.520]  I said, look for a false flag. They've already been trying these chemical attacks. Look for
[1:01:17.520 --> 1:01:22.720]  him to do it again. This is very predictable. I've never heard Ron Paul be so just absolutely
[1:01:22.720 --> 1:01:27.040]  certain though. He's like, this is 100% false flag because of the common sense.
[1:01:27.040 --> 1:01:33.280]  Key bono in Latin. Who benefits? But as I sit here and I look at this today, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:01:34.800 --> 1:01:39.600]  it's just crazy that CNN immediately and then the Joint Chiefs, yeah, we have witnesses on the
[1:01:39.600 --> 1:01:45.200]  ground that some planes flew over and some bombs got dropped. And then Syria says,
[1:01:47.920 --> 1:01:53.280]  must have been chemicals that they had. Of course, you have the rebels admittedly cooking up
[1:01:53.280 --> 1:01:57.200]  chemicals and they've been caught using them and doing it. That's admitted. The UN's admitted it.
[1:01:57.200 --> 1:02:01.680]  They've been caught on video doing it. That's what's so crazy is this all hinges on acting
[1:02:01.680 --> 1:02:06.640]  like there's no memory. Just like we're spying on Trump. We've got the intercepts, the proof.
[1:02:06.640 --> 1:02:12.160]  That was two months ago. Trump goes, that's illegal to release that plus you don't because we didn't
[1:02:12.160 --> 1:02:16.080]  do that. Oh, actually, we never did it. You're crazy. And then of course, it all comes out.
[1:02:16.080 --> 1:02:22.160]  Susan Rice, Obama, the unmasking, it's all illegal. But by then they've always changed the subject
[1:02:22.160 --> 1:02:26.720]  and then put Trump. Remember what Michael Moore and somebody other said they said after he gets in
[1:02:26.720 --> 1:02:32.960]  office, he's going to be faced with all these different global crises and then we'll be able
[1:02:32.960 --> 1:02:42.320]  to bring him down. And they're doing it. And Bannon's gone. Bannon threatened to quit if removed
[1:02:42.320 --> 1:02:49.040]  from National Security Council role report. Chief White House strategist Stephen Bannon was unhappy
[1:02:49.040 --> 1:02:54.240]  with the decision to remove him from his role in the National Security Council threatened to quit.
[1:02:54.880 --> 1:02:58.240]  But it was certain to quit the council over the war. According to a new report, you can't
[1:02:58.240 --> 1:03:03.440]  believe he was on the New York Times. The New York Times reported Wednesday evening that Bannon
[1:03:04.080 --> 1:03:08.400]  resisted the move and threatened to resign if the change was made. But the Times said his team
[1:03:08.400 --> 1:03:12.160]  had denied that he never made such a statement. Yeah. I mean, and who are these people inside
[1:03:12.160 --> 1:03:18.480]  leaking it? Kushner? Are there all sorts of articles out there in major newspapers that, oh,
[1:03:18.480 --> 1:03:23.520]  I must start like Jewish people because our intel is Kushner's leaking stuff. Just the most, it's
[1:03:23.520 --> 1:03:30.880]  the craziest political correct garbage everywhere. It's just maddening. It's like I criticized the
[1:03:30.880 --> 1:03:36.640]  Nazi collaborator, George Soros, and there's articles saying I must be anti-semitic. It just
[1:03:36.640 --> 1:03:41.680]  doesn't work anymore. Is there any use there? Bannon, who led President Trump's campaign
[1:03:41.680 --> 1:03:46.400]  in its final months, was elevated in January to position on the NSC principles committee,
[1:03:46.400 --> 1:03:49.360]  drawing widespread criticism that Trump was trying to politicize the council.
[1:03:49.360 --> 1:03:53.280]  But Chairman of the John Keats of Staff and Director of National Intelligence had their
[1:03:53.280 --> 1:03:58.480]  roles downgraded in the move. National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster has now reversed some of
[1:03:58.480 --> 1:04:02.640]  those changes, a move that was approved by Trump according to senior White House official.
[1:04:02.640 --> 1:04:08.720]  Yeah, and John McCain said yesterday, the normal order of things in Washington is now coming back
[1:04:08.720 --> 1:04:14.320]  to equilibrium. I'm paraphrasing, but that was the quote. The normal order is now returning
[1:04:14.320 --> 1:04:21.520]  to where it should be, yes. The normal order of just a bunch of liars running around backing
[1:04:21.520 --> 1:04:30.240]  the most radical Muslim groups, overthrowing nations that are much freer. And Judge Knapp
[1:04:30.240 --> 1:04:34.720]  says amassing Americans for reasons other than national security is called espionage. And when
[1:04:34.720 --> 1:04:42.240]  we come back, I've got some more clips on that front. We've got, we've also got CNN,
[1:04:42.240 --> 1:04:49.840]  again, kids reading off teleprompters. Please come invade. I am here. I need your help in Syria.
[1:04:50.400 --> 1:04:55.120]  I am here. Help me while they're like you and CNN studios or whatever. I mean,
[1:04:55.120 --> 1:05:21.440]  it's just, there's, there's no way to CNN folks.
[1:05:26.080 --> 1:05:30.320]  Just to rub our noses in it, Representative Adam Schiff, Democrat member of the House
[1:05:30.320 --> 1:05:34.800]  Intelligence Committee, made a public statement moments after Nunes' announcement saying how
[1:05:34.800 --> 1:05:40.160]  pleased he was to hear of Nunes' recusal. So now the Democrats have a monopoly on the political
[1:05:40.160 --> 1:05:44.320]  witch hunt that is the Russian probe. Thanks, Nunes. The Republicans have gotten their leverage
[1:05:44.320 --> 1:05:49.280]  democratically and refused to use it. The Democrats get their leverage with smear campaigns and use
[1:05:49.280 --> 1:05:53.920]  it successfully. And if we keep allowing them to do it, they're going to continue. President
[1:05:53.920 --> 1:05:58.720]  Trump, the swamp is draining us. For Infowars.com, this is Owen Schreuer.

[1:07:03.680 --> 1:07:06.480]  Let's go to Devin and Florida. Devin and Florida, you're on the air.
[1:07:07.360 --> 1:07:13.360]  Great. Hey, thank you so much. Listen, I have bought your product and I gotta say they're amazing.
[1:07:13.360 --> 1:07:18.720]  Thank you. Anyone who's on the fence, buy it because I've got cabins, superman vitality,
[1:07:18.720 --> 1:07:24.400]  secret swell, vitamin mineral fusion, I've got the body armor. Wow, thank you. You're the top
[1:07:24.400 --> 1:07:28.160]  of the list that makes it all possible. Which pharmaceutical does you like best? I really
[1:07:28.160 --> 1:07:32.880]  like the vitamin mineral fusion, to be honest. That's amazing. That's really incredible. I drank
[1:07:32.880 --> 1:07:37.440]  it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible, like I haven't felt sweet. My morning
[1:07:37.440 --> 1:07:44.160]  was fantastic and I love the guys, I love the info, it's true and I just want to, yeah, I want to
[1:07:44.160 --> 1:07:49.840]  take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence, just buy it, you will love it.
[1:07:49.840 --> 1:07:54.160]  I'm telling you, I've never bought a bad product. What you find in our news is the same thing you

[1:08:06.240 --> 1:08:11.680]  The globalist's great error is to believe that as they collapse humanity, they end up on top.
[1:08:11.680 --> 1:08:19.760]  The truth is, humanity is coming down fast, but we're miles above them, on our journey to hell.
[1:08:22.000 --> 1:08:24.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:08:24.800 --> 1:08:34.800]  I'm coming down fast, but now I'm in for you.
[1:08:38.800 --> 1:08:44.080]  Xi Jinping is arriving at like six o'clock in Mar-Lago. They're gonna have dinner and things,
[1:08:44.080 --> 1:08:47.760]  probably won't have any press conferences or anything until tomorrow. We'll be covering that
[1:08:47.760 --> 1:08:52.880]  live, obviously, because that is important. He's the Communist Chinese dictator with massive tensions
[1:08:52.880 --> 1:09:02.320]  unparalleled since the ceasefire on the Korean War in July of 1953. That is a big deal with North
[1:09:02.320 --> 1:09:06.480]  Korea threatening to nuke everybody as usual, and of course the Democrats helped give them all that
[1:09:06.480 --> 1:09:13.440]  technology to do it. But we have the Democrats today with the Senate and the House Intelligence
[1:09:13.440 --> 1:09:20.640]  Committees just running around on this witch hunt about Russians everywhere, unmasking people,
[1:09:20.640 --> 1:09:25.840]  and then the intel is clear. There's nothing there. Congressman Nunes talks about it, and then he gets
[1:09:25.840 --> 1:09:31.520]  ethics complaints on him, so he recuses himself. When did Democrats start recusing themselves
[1:09:31.520 --> 1:09:35.440]  for being connected to Hillary Clinton and the uranium deals and all the rest of it? I'm sick of
[1:09:35.440 --> 1:09:41.280]  it. And the media is like, oh, Alex is scared of a Russian investigation. No, actually, I'm scared
[1:09:41.280 --> 1:09:47.760]  that they're going to find out I'm a Martian and that the moon's made of cheese. Trump is trying
[1:09:47.760 --> 1:09:54.080]  to restore our republic. And you've got the Republicans of the Democratic Party ganging up on
[1:09:54.080 --> 1:09:59.360]  Trump trying to make him do their will geopolitically to go start wars in Syria, you name it. And
[1:09:59.360 --> 1:10:03.840]  notice they're already blaming Trump. Oh, this is all happening in Syria because of you when
[1:10:03.840 --> 1:10:08.320]  Hillary and the Democrats and the globalists admittedly started the civil war, bringing in the
[1:10:09.040 --> 1:10:16.960]  jihadis six years ago. Hell, they'll probably blame Libya next on Trump. That failed state.
[1:10:16.960 --> 1:10:23.280]  So it's an amazing time to be alive. I wanted to get Dr. Group on for two segments, and I appreciate
[1:10:23.280 --> 1:10:28.400]  him coming on. Then we've got Dr. Paul Craig Roberts joining us on the military, the economy,
[1:10:29.760 --> 1:10:37.600]  Michael Snyder, Paul Watson's special report, Mickey Millie Weaver, John Rappaport, and others.
[1:10:38.880 --> 1:10:41.760]  But I wanted to get Group on and I guess it's a good time to get him on
[1:10:41.760 --> 1:10:48.400]  because we don't just see them kicking us off ad rolls. We can't advertise on Google and trying
[1:10:48.400 --> 1:10:53.520]  to get us kicked off Google, completely Democratic Party openly saying that. We don't just see things
[1:10:53.520 --> 1:11:00.080]  like that. We see industrial type stuff where we're getting our materials getting messed with or
[1:11:01.600 --> 1:11:08.000]  regulators coming after us, all sorts of stuff in a message to everyone that don't mess with
[1:11:08.000 --> 1:11:11.920]  the new world order or will come shut you down. You're already shutting down society. You're already
[1:11:11.920 --> 1:11:18.560]  taking over. We have a responsibility to do that. But take our probiotics that have hundreds and
[1:11:18.560 --> 1:11:25.200]  hundreds of five-star reviews on outside third-party sites like Power Reviews. They got a Federal
[1:11:25.200 --> 1:11:29.440]  Trade Commission complaint, which is a joke. They laughed at it, sent a letter back saying,
[1:11:29.440 --> 1:11:33.920]  this ought to all be fake because he's got the best reviews on your site. They're like, no,
[1:11:33.920 --> 1:11:41.600]  actually, we cut out the ones that are too positive to follow FDA rules. I mean, we could go get
[1:11:41.600 --> 1:11:45.360]  reviews from 20 places and show you the same stuff. It's our listeners. They're buying it. They love
[1:11:45.360 --> 1:11:52.320]  it. Biome Defense is a great probiotic. Probiotics is my right to take good cultures of bacteria,
[1:11:53.200 --> 1:12:00.240]  whether I got it from Sauerkraut or Biome Defense or whatever or yogurt. That's not even debated.
[1:12:00.240 --> 1:12:06.480]  It's not even debated that if you have iodine deficiencies, you'll die. Now, here's the latest
[1:12:06.480 --> 1:12:13.680]  article. I was set in grip of last week to talk about this. Today, a huge Vox report, 10 pages long,
[1:12:13.680 --> 1:12:18.240]  I watched Alex Jones give his viewers health advice. No, I didn't. I'm a citizen. I can give
[1:12:18.240 --> 1:12:22.960]  you my opinion. I can read news articles if I want. But this is all tailored to, again, try to get
[1:12:24.000 --> 1:12:28.080]  the FDA after me. They're coming on every front. Good. That just means I'm telling the truth and
[1:12:28.080 --> 1:12:35.280]  take an action. Because look at this. Then you learn it's not even me giving advice. It's Dr. Group
[1:12:35.280 --> 1:12:45.040]  on breaking down major studies. So there are more and more anti-fungal and anti-cundi, basically
[1:12:46.880 --> 1:12:50.400]  in the same class as probiotics. I mean, you go to Whole Foods, they're selling stuff similar to
[1:12:50.400 --> 1:12:55.760]  what we've got. This is totally normal because you lose the good bacteria because of pesticides in
[1:12:55.760 --> 1:13:00.560]  your gut or antibiotics or whatever the case may be. Then the bad stuff, the yeast and all of it
[1:13:00.560 --> 1:13:05.840]  moves in. That's all over mainstream news. That's all over everywhere. I don't think that's even
[1:13:05.840 --> 1:13:14.800]  debated. But they say, I invented this. We invented probiotics and we invented anti-fungals
[1:13:14.800 --> 1:13:20.880]  in the intestines. Ladies and gentlemen, 10 pages of the craziest bull I've ever read.
[1:13:20.880 --> 1:13:29.200]  Everything we sell is FDA grass. That's the law that means it's seen as safe. We have the biggest
[1:13:29.200 --> 1:13:34.640]  companies making it. The top labs testing it all because we know we're a target and we follow things
[1:13:34.640 --> 1:13:38.560]  to a ridiculous level. You hear everybody else making claims out there. We don't.
[1:13:41.520 --> 1:13:47.520]  I can tell you what X2 and all this has done for me, but this is what they're doing. They say,
[1:13:47.520 --> 1:13:52.000]  I'm the worst person on earth, worse than Dr. Oz. Worse than everybody. I'm insane.
[1:13:54.240 --> 1:14:02.800]  Autism isn't on the rise. They also say I'm crazy and that HPV hasn't been linked to deaths
[1:14:03.360 --> 1:14:06.240]  all over the world and been banned in places like India and Japan.
[1:14:07.360 --> 1:14:10.960]  I mean, I see mainstream news articles every day where people are getting paralyzed and dying from
[1:14:10.960 --> 1:14:15.840]  Gardasil. They approved it here in Texas to make everybody else accept it through an emergency
[1:14:15.840 --> 1:14:21.520]  law. Rick Perry put through 10 years ago. I remember all the deaths. Even a little newspapers were
[1:14:21.520 --> 1:14:26.720]  saying it was horrible. But you read this, man. You read this and you'd think Gardasil doesn't
[1:14:26.720 --> 1:14:33.200]  even have any side effects. And they say, Jones sits up there like, he's a doctor and says,
[1:14:33.200 --> 1:14:38.800]  Gardasil does this and this does that. No, I said my grandmother got polio from the polio vaccine
[1:14:38.800 --> 1:14:44.320]  and her MD told her that. They go, oh, get your second round. Another strain. She got it a week
[1:14:44.320 --> 1:14:50.720]  later. It ruined much of her life. My mother almost died from a flu shot. We all have these
[1:14:50.720 --> 1:14:55.840]  stories. We all know. We know what the insert says, but they look at us like we're crazy.
[1:14:56.400 --> 1:15:01.040]  So Dr. Groups here wasn't going to come on about iodine and why it's so important and
[1:15:01.040 --> 1:15:04.880]  where we get it and why we're starting to run into some problems. I'm not going to say that's
[1:15:04.880 --> 1:15:09.680]  what this is, but it's from every angle, which is fine. I expect this. I knew this. We're changing
[1:15:09.680 --> 1:15:14.160]  the world. And sometimes I get a little angry. I say things sometimes that I didn't mean to
[1:15:14.160 --> 1:15:19.200]  say out of term, whatever, but it's my heart's good. And we're trying to turn the world around
[1:15:19.200 --> 1:15:22.720]  and try to not have World War three because I got children. So does Dr. Groups. Dr. Group got
[1:15:22.720 --> 1:15:26.560]  this short segment, another segment getting into this today. I know you sent me a lot of news
[1:15:26.560 --> 1:15:31.680]  articles, new big studies out about iodine, all of it, but just separately, what do you make of
[1:15:31.680 --> 1:15:37.520]  this new thing? I don't know if you've seen this where, where we're probiotics. Did you know we
[1:15:37.520 --> 1:15:43.200]  just made that up? Dr. Group? Yeah, the good thing about that, even though they're, they're coming
[1:15:43.200 --> 1:15:47.280]  out with all these articles, they're just trying to attack us on every single level right now. I,
[1:15:47.280 --> 1:15:53.680]  I read that Vox article as well. I mean, the fact of the matter is the definition of an epidemic
[1:15:53.680 --> 1:15:59.280]  is a widespread occurrence of any infectious disease at any community and community at any
[1:15:59.280 --> 1:16:04.640]  particular time. You can go on Google, you can look at PubMed Studies, you can look, I mean,
[1:16:04.640 --> 1:16:11.280]  we're not going to get on the air and talk about stuff that we don't know 100% is right. I mean,
[1:16:11.280 --> 1:16:21.280]  the far left, this, this media attack against the truth is nothing more than just trying to
[1:16:22.160 --> 1:16:27.360]  get people to try to believe something that's false. I mean, it's just, you look at fake news out
[1:16:27.360 --> 1:16:33.600]  there and it's just amazing that these individuals can come out and talk about all this stuff.
[1:16:33.600 --> 1:16:38.880]  With a straight face, they, they attack our probiotic and say, we've invented something
[1:16:38.880 --> 1:16:42.720]  for something that doesn't exist. Probiotics is the fastest growing industry in the country.
[1:16:43.360 --> 1:16:50.160]  Yeah. What happened to like real journalism out there? I mean, anybody can take what we say on
[1:16:50.160 --> 1:16:55.760]  the air and anybody can take the information, that article and go look, type in Candida,
[1:16:55.760 --> 1:17:02.080]  type in fungus among us, type in mold problems, type in all this stuff. And they're going to see
[1:17:02.080 --> 1:17:05.920]  that what we're doing is we're actually telling the truth. And I think that they, you know,
[1:17:05.920 --> 1:17:11.200]  when you have an article or something come out like that, they just know that it's truth.
[1:17:11.200 --> 1:17:16.240]  I mean, they know that it's truth and that's why they're trying to counteract it and trying to
[1:17:16.240 --> 1:17:20.240]  say that it's not true. Let me tell you a story. Let me tell you a story. I know three people in
[1:17:20.240 --> 1:17:25.440]  this building that told me they had irritable bowel and all sorts of problems. And I said,
[1:17:25.440 --> 1:17:29.120]  take them every day. All three came back to me in the last six months and said,
[1:17:29.120 --> 1:17:32.800]  totally normal now, my life totally changed. I mean, it's incredible.
[1:17:32.800 --> 1:17:36.960]  Because the medical profession has not taught the doctors about gut health. Even when we were
[1:17:36.960 --> 1:17:41.840]  coming out with our studies 20 years ago, and we interviewed a hundred gastroenterologists
[1:17:41.840 --> 1:17:46.480]  around the country and asked them how important are probiotics, how important is gut health and
[1:17:46.480 --> 1:17:53.200]  the creation of disease? Our research is showing that the accumulation of toxins in the body and
[1:17:53.200 --> 1:17:58.960]  in the gut is causing leaky gut syndrome is causing malfunctions. We're having gut crises.
[1:17:58.960 --> 1:18:02.880]  I mean, Crohn's disease 50 years ago is unknown. Now it's everywhere.
[1:18:04.000 --> 1:18:08.320]  Right. And they were telling us 15 years ago, oh, that doesn't make any difference. Oh,
[1:18:08.320 --> 1:18:12.800]  you can eat what you want. Organic food doesn't make a difference. Oh, there's no such thing as
[1:18:12.800 --> 1:18:16.080]  chemical. Let me ask you this. What do you make of how it's mainly liberals going crazy?
[1:18:17.840 --> 1:18:21.040]  When it's liberals are one of the areas they're actually informed on is probiotics.
[1:18:23.120 --> 1:18:27.040]  They're just, I mean, I don't know. It's a mass conscious new shift with liberals,
[1:18:27.040 --> 1:18:33.360]  I guess, because across the board politically, you know, with the geoengineering chemtrail thing,
[1:18:33.360 --> 1:18:38.640]  which they still say doesn't, chemtrails don't exist when you can pull up the patents
[1:18:38.640 --> 1:18:45.600]  and the geoengineering documents and the government approving 80 billion tons to be
[1:18:45.600 --> 1:18:51.440]  sprayed in the air of aluminum oxide nanoparticles. I mean, it's all there right in front of your
[1:18:51.440 --> 1:18:57.280]  face. If you, if you can pull it up and Vonsanto and the, you know, all of a sudden that
[1:18:57.840 --> 1:19:02.160]  genetically modified foods are going to be the savior of the planet. And we're all going to
[1:19:02.160 --> 1:19:08.640]  be able to have healthy genetically modified foods to eat. It's just running rampant right now.
[1:19:08.640 --> 1:19:14.880]  Look at what's happening with like Gorsuch, who's a great qualified person, probably to be in the
[1:19:14.880 --> 1:19:19.040]  Supreme Court. And they're just attacking everything, attacking everything, attacking
[1:19:19.040 --> 1:19:26.640]  everything. Because when you look back, obviously, and you look at the design of all what the earth
[1:19:26.640 --> 1:19:31.200]  has had to go through and look at the healthcare system that we're currently suffering from,
[1:19:31.200 --> 1:19:34.800]  the great news, Alex, is people are waking up and they're not believing. They are. So what we're
[1:19:34.800 --> 1:19:39.360]  seeing is what we're seeing is death row. That's why we've got to be peaceful, even when they
[1:19:39.360 --> 1:19:43.920]  provocate one and say they want to kill us and say we're Russian spies and say they want to kill
[1:19:43.920 --> 1:19:48.000]  Trump. Sometimes, you know, we get angry and we say, okay, I'll punch you or whatever. No, we've
[1:19:48.000 --> 1:19:52.240]  got to be like Gandhi, as I've always preached because they're so violent and hateful now. I
[1:19:52.240 --> 1:19:58.080]  catch myself, you know, slipping up and adding to it. We've got to like just de-escalate things
[1:19:58.080 --> 1:20:03.440]  and just try to have cooler heads prevail. Think about this. Your community's aging water
[1:20:03.440 --> 1:20:07.920]  infrastructure systems are very likely to be contaminated with heavy metals like lead,
[1:20:07.920 --> 1:20:12.960]  disinfection chemicals like ammonia, chlorine and chloramines, and pharmaceuticals like statins,
[1:20:12.960 --> 1:20:17.360]  pain meds and antidepressants. And no, water treatment plants are not equipped to filter these
[1:20:17.360 --> 1:20:22.080]  pharmaceutical toxins out. Protect your family's water supply with a trusted big Berkey water

[1:21:58.400 --> 1:22:05.600]  3333. Hi, my name's John Kunkel. I'm 63 years of age. I watch several YouTube videos of Steven
[1:22:05.600 --> 1:22:09.760]  Hewer's and learn what supplements might help me with energy and weight loss. I have now,
[1:22:09.760 --> 1:22:14.320]  but on the entry, is black cumin seed oil, synergy one, six other products from synergistic

[1:22:24.800 --> 1:22:29.360]  hungry. Even my cravings for foods like hamburgers and heavy carbohydrate meals are now gone. This
[1:22:29.360 --> 1:22:33.360]  is the only thing that's worked for me. I was seriously considering bariatric surgery,
[1:22:33.360 --> 1:22:38.240]  but that's out the window now. Thank you so much, synergistic nutrition. With synergistic nutrition,

[1:24:06.240 --> 1:24:10.640]  This is the end. I mean, I got to tell you, they have no creativity with these lies.
[1:24:11.840 --> 1:24:18.240]  They just invert things. We got to the biggest, most respected labs in the country and produced
[1:24:18.240 --> 1:24:25.440]  probiotics and antifungals that I know for a fact they've got big fancy labs here in Austin
[1:24:25.440 --> 1:24:30.800]  where rich people go and pay four or five times for basically the same stuff for the antifungals.
[1:24:30.800 --> 1:24:37.520]  And they just, you know, absolutely live by it, what Getting Candida and all this out does.
[1:24:37.520 --> 1:24:44.320]  And then we sell a high-quality brand of it and we're the devil. I mean, everything we sell is
[1:24:44.320 --> 1:24:51.600]  established, totally established. A lot of our stuff is just private labeled famous brands.
[1:24:53.440 --> 1:24:56.720]  You know, our toothpaste gets made by the biggest group that puts out fluoride-free
[1:24:56.720 --> 1:25:02.240]  toothpaste. We just add iodine and and colloidal silver to it. And it's just you sit there and
[1:25:02.240 --> 1:25:05.840]  you watch the attacks, but we've got a few minutes left on the group. You really wanted to come on
[1:25:05.840 --> 1:25:10.640]  about all the iodine, some of the new studies that are out, but also, you know, we've talked
[1:25:10.640 --> 1:25:15.280]  some about this mainly over email. Do you think we're going to be able to continue, at least from
[1:25:15.280 --> 1:25:21.040]  this source, to be able to get this iodine from the deep earth? Right now, iodine is in the news
[1:25:21.040 --> 1:25:26.800]  everywhere. Israel just finished their huge national survey on iodine deficiency because
[1:25:26.800 --> 1:25:33.120]  they're having so many people over there come down, babies with mental retardation, thyroid issues.
[1:25:33.120 --> 1:25:39.680]  It's happening all over the world. So the demand for iodine is increasing at a pretty exponential
[1:25:39.680 --> 1:25:46.800]  rate. The study in Israel just showed that 62% of school-aged children, 85% of pregnant women,
[1:25:46.800 --> 1:25:52.800]  have low iodine intake. Folks ask why my children glow, literally. And then they just go, oh,
[1:25:52.800 --> 1:25:57.440]  they're glowing. What's going on? And I go, iodine, but it's not the crap iodine. That stuff will
[1:25:57.440 --> 1:26:05.360]  kill you. Explain why X2 is so special. Right. So iodine in nature is I2 and it has two iodines
[1:26:05.360 --> 1:26:10.000]  stuck together and it's very caustic. You can't take that in your mouth. If you just take pure
[1:26:10.000 --> 1:26:15.600]  iodine crystals, you'll start to see that purple smoke come off of it. So it's a very oxidating
[1:26:15.600 --> 1:26:20.880]  substance. So what we have to do is take it through this complete detoxification process.
[1:26:20.880 --> 1:26:24.720]  Which is Russian patents. So now we're proven we're evil Russians now.
[1:26:26.560 --> 1:26:32.080]  But the key is starting with the raw material and that's, you know, making sure you start with a pure
[1:26:32.080 --> 1:26:41.760]  99.99% iodine crystals, US pharmaceutical or USP or British pharmacopia, those are the highest
[1:26:41.760 --> 1:26:47.440]  purity standards in the world. And you have to have 99.7% or higher.
[1:26:47.440 --> 1:26:52.400]  And you have to have a DEA license because this can be in its raw form used for so much stuff.
[1:26:53.200 --> 1:26:58.240]  Right. I mean, iodine crystals are used to produce crystal meth. And so you really have to,
[1:26:58.240 --> 1:27:02.640]  the DEA, you know, follows this very closely. We have to have strict procedures.
[1:27:02.640 --> 1:27:06.160]  But I mean, it's, you know, you follow it back. Like you were talking about, you know,
[1:27:06.160 --> 1:27:10.400]  the fungus thing and the articles, you look at why we're dealing with that and why they're
[1:27:10.400 --> 1:27:15.840]  trying to be quiet about it. Just with iodine. Okay. There's always some sinister plan behind it.
[1:27:15.840 --> 1:27:21.200]  Let's take out iodine from everywhere. We know what it's going to cause when people become iodine
[1:27:21.200 --> 1:27:26.080]  deficient. Let's replace it with bromine. Let's put fluoride in the water. We know all the different
[1:27:26.080 --> 1:27:31.680]  halogens that are going to cause people to become sick and become controllable. Because again,
[1:27:31.680 --> 1:27:35.440]  this is a fact I'm stating. I mean, I'm not a rocket scientist, but I can read a report on a rocket.
[1:27:36.160 --> 1:27:40.560]  Your thyroid and other glands will absorb the bad and use it if it doesn't have the good.
[1:27:40.560 --> 1:27:44.640]  And then that's it. Take the good halogen out, put the bad halogen in. The federal government
[1:27:44.640 --> 1:27:50.480]  went until the seventies mandated iodine and the salt. That's right. That's right. So there's always
[1:27:50.480 --> 1:27:55.280]  a cause even with the candida and the fungus thing. Look at high fructose corn syrup. Look at all the
[1:27:55.280 --> 1:27:59.840]  chemicals in the food and the beverages that they're promoting. What do those things do?
[1:27:59.840 --> 1:28:06.000]  They cause an increase of fungus and everything starts from the gut. You know, if you heal the gut,
[1:28:06.000 --> 1:28:11.760]  then everything else starts to follow in. So another, there's a lot of new discoveries coming
[1:28:11.760 --> 1:28:17.360]  out too as far as iodine is concerned. MIT just came out with a new study that they're going to
[1:28:17.360 --> 1:28:23.200]  be using iodine possibly in batteries to extend the life of batteries. Iodine deficiency
[1:28:23.200 --> 1:28:29.840]  is affecting 11 million children across the world. It was a new study that just came out by
[1:28:29.840 --> 1:28:38.080]  Dr. The Pediatrics Dean at a child specialist facility. And they're linking iodine deficiency
[1:28:38.080 --> 1:28:43.280]  and brain damage to 43 million people now. So I mean, Alex, these are all the things that we
[1:28:43.280 --> 1:28:48.720]  identify years and years. By the way, we're putting mainstream news articles up. And if you look at
[1:28:48.720 --> 1:28:53.600]  Pharmakia and they're all getting into iodine, suddenly there's all these iodines on the shelves,
[1:28:53.600 --> 1:28:58.400]  we go in and look, it's all a bunch of crud stuff. I mean, it's just crazy that we are literally the
[1:28:58.400 --> 1:29:04.000]  only group putting the pure stuff out. It's just, it's unbelievable. Yeah. And there are surveys
[1:29:04.000 --> 1:29:12.480]  and reports that have come out in the last probably three weeks that do show that there is a supply
[1:29:12.480 --> 1:29:19.280]  issue with iodine. And we don't know because we're digging so deep into the earth if that supply is
[1:29:19.280 --> 1:29:23.120]  going to run out tomorrow or if it's going to run out, you know, whenever it's going to run out.
[1:29:23.120 --> 1:29:27.200]  The point I've heard is that there's a run on it everywhere. Prices are going up, it's harder to get.
[1:29:28.240 --> 1:29:32.560]  That's, that's, that is what's happening. You know, we've got a good supply stopped away just
[1:29:32.560 --> 1:29:38.400]  for emergency purposes and just to make sure Info Wars is going to have a good supply of the X2.
[1:29:38.400 --> 1:29:42.480]  But, you know, you never know what's going to happen. The thing is just make sure that you're taking
[1:29:42.480 --> 1:29:45.680]  all the supplements and make sure you're keeping your body healthy. And you support the broadcast
[1:29:45.680 --> 1:29:50.800]  at the same time. It's like, yeah, absolutely. Band-aids. We didn't invent cuts. We're talking
[1:29:50.800 --> 1:30:08.720]  about things everybody needs. Thank you, Dr. Grip. Amazing job.
[1:30:21.440 --> 1:30:26.880]  more attention than his actual job. Meanwhile, Instyle magazine had to publish a story to boost
[1:30:26.880 --> 1:30:32.240]  Amy Schumer's crushed ego headline reading, dudes, Amy Schumer is not too vulgar. You're just
[1:30:32.240 --> 1:30:37.520]  sexist. So now if a man doesn't like a woman, it's because he's sexist. How dare you not like my
[1:30:37.520 --> 1:30:41.120]  strong crowd woman who breaks all the social paradigms by trying to be elegant and abhorrent
[1:30:41.120 --> 1:30:46.640]  at the same time. See women can do and be anything. Yes, including too vulgar. I ran a series of polls
[1:30:46.640 --> 1:30:52.240]  on Twitter called who's the worst and Amy Schumer won. The people have spoken. Amy Schumer is the
[1:30:52.240 --> 1:30:57.280]  worst. But if the left wants her to be their poster child, go ahead. We will keep winning the culture
[1:30:57.280 --> 1:31:03.120]  war for info wars.com. This is Owen shroyer over the years. There have been a lot of powerful

[1:32:11.680 --> 1:32:16.800]  been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important. What the aging
[1:32:16.800 --> 1:32:23.200]  process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres. Telomeres are the
[1:32:23.200 --> 1:32:28.240]  little cups on the end of our chromosomes. But when it runs out, you start dying. We chose the PQQ

[1:33:31.200 --> 1:33:36.320]  times. I want to open the phones up for listeners about the Russia situation, the serious situation
[1:33:36.320 --> 1:33:42.880]  that ties to Russia. China openly threatening to attack us nuclear weapons. North Korea doing it.
[1:33:42.880 --> 1:33:49.360]  And then Trump just says what stand up against that and our leftist media call him the problem says
[1:33:49.360 --> 1:33:56.000]  it's all because of him and Syria is because of him and Obama cares because of him and everything
[1:33:56.000 --> 1:34:01.760]  else. I saw Chuck E. Schumer about an hour ago giving a press conference saying Trump's like a
[1:34:01.760 --> 1:34:08.640]  98 pound you know child up against a man with China. These are such un-American people that are
[1:34:08.640 --> 1:34:14.720]  rooting for our stock market to fall. There's the quote Schumer. Trump looks like a 98 pound
[1:34:14.720 --> 1:34:23.120]  weakling. Yeah, grab that clip for me if you can. The servile hatred and the way they get liberals
[1:34:23.120 --> 1:34:28.400]  to hate America and to root for their own impoverishment and their own enslavement.
[1:34:29.600 --> 1:34:35.200]  It's the craziest Stockholm syndrome garbage I've ever seen. I want to take your calls.
[1:34:35.200 --> 1:34:43.120]  800-2599-231-800-2599-231. I apologize sometimes we don't go to your calls by the time another
[1:34:43.120 --> 1:34:47.200]  guest comes on and so I leave you on hold. I'll try to hang up on you or at least let you know
[1:34:47.200 --> 1:34:49.680]  that we can't go to you if I don't get to everybody but I'm gonna try to go to your calls
[1:34:49.680 --> 1:34:58.720]  here in just a moment at 800-2599-231. But this is cruising for war with the situation in Syria.
[1:35:00.240 --> 1:35:04.000]  The Russians are saying they're there with a legitimate government aren't gonna back down
[1:35:04.000 --> 1:35:07.360]  unless Trump quote gives them a plan. Russia challenges Trump to say what
[1:35:09.280 --> 1:35:16.160]  they should do. But Trump won't even talk to Russia now because the media has gotten him isolated
[1:35:16.160 --> 1:35:22.880]  and his advisors isolated on purpose. They set Trump up to where now he can't even talk to Russia.
[1:35:22.880 --> 1:35:27.360]  The president and the head of the House Intelligence Committee can't even come over and
[1:35:27.360 --> 1:35:34.960]  view classified material at the White House. That's totally normal. But the Democratic Party
[1:35:34.960 --> 1:35:40.080]  comes in and says no you're gonna recuse yourself. We filed ethics complaints on you
[1:35:40.080 --> 1:35:44.560]  and the Republicans don't file complaints on them. They just keep taking it and taking it and taking
[1:35:44.560 --> 1:35:54.400]  it when the Russians were all in the Democrats junk and they always have been. And I don't even
[1:35:54.400 --> 1:35:57.520]  blame the Russians. That's what foreign governments do. You don't think our government is doing stuff
[1:35:57.520 --> 1:36:04.240]  in Russia? Globalism is in crisis. The globalists admit it's in flames. They admit it's falling
[1:36:04.240 --> 1:36:08.640]  apart. So what are they gonna do? Your phone calls are coming up. Dr. Paul Craig Roberts,
[1:36:08.640 --> 1:36:14.080]  former policy head of the Treasury Department, former head editor at the Wall Street Journal,
[1:36:14.720 --> 1:36:22.240]  prolific writer, and of course researcher. PaulCraigRoberts.org joins us. I want to get his
[1:36:22.240 --> 1:36:29.840]  breakdown on the talk of nuclear war. Even Joel Scousen is up this, the highest threat ever,
[1:36:29.840 --> 1:36:36.960]  saying now it could happen anytime. And who are the power players and why are the western
[1:36:36.960 --> 1:36:40.880]  elites so out to get Russia? And then meanwhile we have John McCain saying yesterday,
[1:36:42.880 --> 1:36:49.520]  now Washington is returning to its normal order. Now that the neocons I guess are in charge
[1:36:49.520 --> 1:36:53.280]  and now there's been a good false flag. Ron Paul has hands down said this is a 100% of
[1:36:53.280 --> 1:36:59.120]  false flag because the very same rebels have been caught red handed at least three times.
[1:36:59.680 --> 1:37:04.000]  Another six, seven, eight times where even the UN says they're the ones that did it.
[1:37:04.720 --> 1:37:09.120]  So within minutes though CNN says Trump says, okay, I'm changing my mind.
[1:37:09.120 --> 1:37:13.760]  Rand Paul says, whoa, whoa, whoa, don't don't back Al Qaeda and ISIS. We're back in the wrong
[1:37:13.760 --> 1:37:19.360]  people. This is an incredible moment. This is how World War start. By the way, the news is saying
[1:37:19.360 --> 1:37:24.480]  I said Trump should nuke China. I said if a war starts, the only way to survive is to hit them
[1:37:24.480 --> 1:37:30.320]  first. Once a nuclear war starts, you've got to have total commitment. I don't want that to happen,
[1:37:30.320 --> 1:37:34.240]  but that's how this stuff builds up. You can't have a regional war anymore, folks.
[1:37:34.240 --> 1:37:38.160]  This has got to stop. Now that's my view. Of course he was in the Reagan administration,
[1:37:38.160 --> 1:37:42.800]  highly respected, was all part of the whole day taunt with Russia and getting them to end the
[1:37:42.800 --> 1:37:46.800]  Cold War. And he joins us to break this down. Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, thanks for coming on with
[1:37:46.800 --> 1:37:52.240]  us. Hello, Alex. Well, you heard my little breakdown. Is that accurate? And where's all this going?
[1:37:53.840 --> 1:37:59.120]  Well, Alex, the near conservatives won't give up their ideology of world hegemony
[1:38:00.000 --> 1:38:04.080]  and the rushes in the way challenge in the way. And of course, in the Middle East,
[1:38:05.280 --> 1:38:14.000]  Iran and Syria in the way. So that's why these four countries are single out for conflict and
[1:38:14.000 --> 1:38:21.360]  accusations because they're in the way of American hegemony over the world. So that's the basic
[1:38:21.360 --> 1:38:27.600]  problem. I know that you were a British strong support of Trump. I thought that
[1:38:28.400 --> 1:38:33.840]  all the promise was with him because he wanted to normalize relations with Russia and he wanted
[1:38:33.840 --> 1:38:41.760]  to stop the offshoring of the American jobs. But I think the establishment has reasserted itself,
[1:38:41.760 --> 1:38:49.200]  you know, they dispensed with Flynn, replaced him with a Russophobic general. They apparently
[1:38:49.200 --> 1:38:55.200]  got rid of Bannon. And so what's left? You know, we've got Zionists and
[1:38:56.480 --> 1:39:04.560]  and crazed generals that talk about wars. So it looks to me like the situation is as bad as you
[1:39:04.560 --> 1:39:15.120]  described it. Dr. Polker Roberts looking at this situation. Trump means well. He's got the economy
[1:39:15.120 --> 1:39:18.880]  going again a little bit. You're an expert on that. We talk about that in a moment. But I notice
[1:39:18.880 --> 1:39:23.920]  as soon as he starts capitulating, Schumer calls him a 98 pound weakling throws him out of the bus
[1:39:23.920 --> 1:39:30.880]  to China. They begin accelerating saying Syria is his fault. Obamacare is his fault. The South
[1:39:30.880 --> 1:39:36.400]  China sees his fault. Doesn't he understand he's a smart guy that rolling over to these people
[1:39:36.400 --> 1:39:44.480]  only only encourages them. They want his head on a on a spike. Well, Alex, they don't need his head
[1:39:44.480 --> 1:39:53.920]  on a spike if he surrenders to them. And I can't say exactly what he is doing. But it does to me
[1:39:53.920 --> 1:40:01.840]  look like surrender. I don't think that he's in a position to fight. You may remember when we
[1:40:01.840 --> 1:40:08.320]  discussed all this a while back, I said his main weakness would be he doesn't know the players.
[1:40:08.320 --> 1:40:14.000]  He doesn't know who to appoint in order to take on the establishment that he is committed to
[1:40:14.000 --> 1:40:20.960]  taking on. And therefore, I thought his chances weren't all that great. But there's still about
[1:40:20.960 --> 1:40:27.920]  to zero. And that's the reason I thought he'd be the best candidate. But it looks like the president
[1:40:27.920 --> 1:40:35.200]  is simply unless he's been the leader of a political movement for some time. He knows the
[1:40:35.200 --> 1:40:39.520]  players. He knows the issues. He knows who's going to back him. He knows what the problem
[1:40:39.520 --> 1:40:45.440]  people are and who they are. It's very difficult for democracy to bring about changes.
[1:40:45.440 --> 1:40:51.920]  Because the deep state is there, well established, you know, it's more than half a century old.
[1:40:52.800 --> 1:40:57.920]  The lobbyists in Washington are well established, they're well connected to the House, the Senate,
[1:40:59.200 --> 1:41:06.400]  to all the executive agencies and to the courts. So a new president comes in, he's inexperienced,
[1:41:07.520 --> 1:41:13.840]  tough guy, but inexperienced and he finds out he's just out flying everywhere. So I think that's
[1:41:13.840 --> 1:41:20.800]  what's happened to him. I think the Trump agenda is for the part that I supported and I think the
[1:41:20.800 --> 1:41:28.960]  part you supported, peace with Russia and bring back the jobs. I think that's over, Alex. I don't
[1:41:28.960 --> 1:41:35.040]  think we're going to see that. And the danger of all this demonization of Russia is that
[1:41:35.840 --> 1:41:42.720]  it convinces the Russian government that the United States and the European countries
[1:41:42.720 --> 1:41:52.480]  are preparing their populations for war pressure. You have to remember during the whole Cold War
[1:41:52.480 --> 1:42:00.800]  period, the American presidents worked closely with the Soviet leaders to reduce the tensions
[1:42:01.920 --> 1:42:10.400]  because both sides received numerous false warnings of missile attack, of incoming ICBMs.
[1:42:10.400 --> 1:42:17.200]  They would never believe because both sides are working together to reduce tensions. But if you're
[1:42:17.200 --> 1:42:24.400]  sitting over there now in Putin's shoes and you've been demonized up and down the railway track and
[1:42:25.360 --> 1:42:31.920]  Russia's demonized and made all these false accusations and you get a report of incoming
[1:42:31.920 --> 1:42:40.560]  missiles and you've got five minutes warning time, you're more inclined to believe it. And so the risk
[1:42:40.560 --> 1:42:48.880]  of war, just from accident now, is extremely high. And that is the new part in this equation.
[1:42:50.080 --> 1:42:56.640]  More or less, we're convincing the Russians that we are preparing a preemptive nuclear strike.
[1:42:56.640 --> 1:43:00.240]  We've got anti-ballistic missile bases going on the borders.
[1:43:00.240 --> 1:43:03.920]  Sure, let's expand on that. I mean, it was Bush in his last few years said, oh, we have a new
[1:43:03.920 --> 1:43:08.640]  doctrine, first strike. We'll strike you first. Well, then China and Russia said that they have
[1:43:08.640 --> 1:43:16.640]  first strike as well. So again, why the insane escalation by the neocons and why are they so
[1:43:16.640 --> 1:43:30.320]  hard to keep out of power? The reason is Russia can block American unilateralism, so can China. And
[1:43:30.320 --> 1:43:37.440]  the neoconsertive doctrine, Alex, is that the United States is the unipower and cannot permit
[1:43:37.440 --> 1:43:43.680]  the rise of any other country that could block American unilateral action.
[1:43:43.680 --> 1:43:51.600]  Well, both countries have been able to do that. The neocons didn't expect the quick
[1:43:52.320 --> 1:43:58.160]  return of Russia to power, and they didn't expect the quick rise of China. But they were focused
[1:43:58.880 --> 1:44:07.120]  on their Middle Eastern wars there for decades, while China beat by far the predictions of when
[1:44:07.120 --> 1:44:14.400]  they would be a major force. And during the period when Putin, who was initially seen as the protege
[1:44:14.400 --> 1:44:21.440]  of Yeltsin, who would continue under Washington's thumb, just like Yeltsin, instead he was able
[1:44:21.440 --> 1:44:29.920]  to recreate Russia as a power. So when they were faced with, hey, look, we've now got two
[1:44:29.920 --> 1:44:37.600]  countries that are capable of blocking us from unilateral action. They turned on both countries,
[1:44:38.160 --> 1:44:45.200]  and they're trying to destabilize them. That's what the Ukrainian coup was about.
[1:44:46.000 --> 1:44:55.360]  And all of this propaganda, they're trying to threaten them into accepting some form of American
[1:44:55.360 --> 1:45:04.560]  vassalage so that the Russians can be negotiated out of blocking American unilateralism.
[1:45:05.520 --> 1:45:15.360]  Well, as you noted, there's a lot of risk there. And when you convince a thermonuclear power that
[1:45:15.360 --> 1:45:20.320]  you're setting them up for primitive nuclear attack, you can't expect them just to sit there and wait
[1:45:20.320 --> 1:45:29.520]  for it. And you see, from Putin, all kinds of pleas, he has these meetings with an extensive
[1:45:29.520 --> 1:45:34.480]  number of Western journalists. He says, how do I get through to you? Don't you understand
[1:45:34.480 --> 1:45:40.080]  what's happening? Don't you understand the risk? But why do you repeat all of these lies
[1:45:40.080 --> 1:45:46.080]  that destroy trust that builds suspicion? And we also noticed the neocon,
[1:45:46.080 --> 1:45:51.040]  neo-lib media attacks the nationalist movement, America, they just hate anything independent.
[1:45:51.680 --> 1:45:54.880]  And I see China as a threat, as you know, communistic and evil.
[1:45:56.400 --> 1:45:59.360]  I don't agree with that. That's part of their propaganda.
[1:45:59.360 --> 1:46:01.680]  Well, I mean, I've studied what's going on in China. I know you're a smart guy.
[1:46:01.680 --> 1:46:05.440]  All I'm saying is this, our elites help transfer a lot of weapons to China.
[1:46:05.920 --> 1:46:10.240]  And so I'm asking why the elites don't get the reason they're getting checkmated when
[1:46:10.240 --> 1:46:16.880]  they're the ones that help give them the weapons. I don't know to what extent that
[1:46:16.880 --> 1:46:21.360]  we've transferred weapons to them. The Russian weapons systems are actually better.
[1:46:22.080 --> 1:46:27.760]  The fighters are better. I think from the whole, China now has substantial
[1:46:30.160 --> 1:46:37.120]  warfare capability. What we did for China was when we all short so many,
[1:46:37.120 --> 1:46:40.720]  sure, of course, that's the big thing. That's the real power base. Well, expanding on that,
[1:46:40.720 --> 1:46:43.920]  I'm just, I just see the three different predatory states, not one's good, one's bad.
[1:46:43.920 --> 1:46:48.160]  I do see the whole Anglo-American establishment, obviously, as the big global hegemonic thing
[1:46:48.160 --> 1:46:53.280]  that's announced its Paxima or Akana and its right to rule. So obviously, I'm against that
[1:46:53.280 --> 1:46:58.080]  happening. In the few months we have left here, the economy, something you're an expert on,
[1:46:58.800 --> 1:47:03.600]  I see Trump racing, trying to get jobs back. I see a lot of the power structure trying to
[1:47:03.600 --> 1:47:08.720]  do things to actually curtail that. Just in a snapshot, what do you think the global economy
[1:47:08.720 --> 1:47:17.680]  is right now? Well, you know, what the global economy is a form of colonialism. It's neocolonialism.
[1:47:17.680 --> 1:47:28.160]  It's the way the first world continues to explore the third world. And now to explore also its own
[1:47:28.160 --> 1:47:38.320]  members, like Greece, Portugal, who are forced into massive austerity and sell off of public assets
[1:47:39.840 --> 1:47:48.560]  in order to pay creditors. So globalism is no real such thing as a global economy. It basically
[1:47:48.560 --> 1:47:55.520]  means an economy in which the first world continues to ride roughshod or the rest of them.
[1:47:55.520 --> 1:48:03.120]  Well, so it only serves the 1% in the West. And the 1% or so in bread and decadent, or the one
[1:48:03.120 --> 1:48:08.320]  tenth of 1%, they don't realize the world, according to mainline analysts, is in the most
[1:48:08.320 --> 1:48:14.720]  dangerous position it's ever been in. That's right. I think it is in a dangerous position because
[1:48:15.760 --> 1:48:24.000]  you know, what's happening is the promise of rising living standards, rising income growth.
[1:48:24.000 --> 1:48:33.280]  This is halted. And not just in the United States, but everywhere, or most of it, outside maybe China
[1:48:33.280 --> 1:48:42.320]  or Russia. So when you halt that, then you build in throughout the world, again, dissatisfaction,
[1:48:42.320 --> 1:48:54.240]  unrest, you get more movements toward violence and revolutionary actions and anti-Americanism,
[1:48:54.240 --> 1:48:59.920]  anti-Westernism. And the globalists admit they exacerbate that to further destabilize and further
[1:48:59.920 --> 1:49:05.600]  suck those countries' drive. Yeah, right. I mean, that's what globalism is. Then in a minute and a
[1:49:05.600 --> 1:49:15.760]  half, is there anything positive we can do to turn this around? You know, we had these hopes
[1:49:15.760 --> 1:49:20.960]  for Trump, but I think he's collapsed. The system was too strong for him. He's a strong man. He was
[1:49:20.960 --> 1:49:29.440]  independently wealthy. He didn't need anything. He had the chance, but I don't think he was able to
[1:49:29.440 --> 1:49:34.640]  pull it off. I don't think that he was with them from the beginning, or that he intentionally
[1:49:34.640 --> 1:49:41.840]  sold out or anything like that. I just think the system proved to be too strong for a president.
[1:49:41.840 --> 1:49:48.480]  The swamp drains you. The swamp? Yeah. So, you know, Chris Hedges and some of these people
[1:49:49.520 --> 1:49:57.600]  say the only solution is revolution. I don't really know. I think Alex Whitlake is likely to
[1:49:57.600 --> 1:50:06.320]  happen is we overreach. We get checked, mate. We have some economic crisis the Fed can't control,
[1:50:07.280 --> 1:50:13.520]  and there's a form of collapse, and out of the collapse can come real change. Maybe that's what
[1:50:13.520 --> 1:50:17.280]  happens. You have to hope for a collapse if Trump can't fix it and we can't fix it so there's not
[1:50:17.280 --> 1:50:24.320]  nuclear war. It's like... We certainly don't want a nuclear war. The weapons today are so powerful
[1:50:24.320 --> 1:50:30.240]  there this won't be anybody left. And you have to keep in mind that when when the president
[1:50:30.240 --> 1:50:38.960]  russians says we can no longer trust the americans and when the russians say we are never again
[1:50:38.960 --> 1:50:45.440]  fight a war on our own territory they're telling you something and it's not something you want to
[1:50:45.440 --> 1:50:50.800]  push against. I know it's crazy, but we got a bunch of neocons we're never even in combat that want
[1:50:50.800 --> 1:50:55.680]  nuclear war so I guess we have to worship them and let them run things and let the folks in the
[1:50:55.680 --> 1:50:59.520]  house intelligence committee Mr. Schiff tag us to world war three because he has to prove he's a big
[1:50:59.520 --> 1:51:03.840]  tough guy. Thank you. Calls coming up. These uncertain times it makes sense to have a sustainable
[1:51:03.840 --> 1:51:08.640]  backup method to cook food and boil water. If your current plan includes using a fuel burning stove
[1:51:08.640 --> 1:51:13.840]  or cooking over an open fire then there's a much better way. The Minuteman rocket stove is a biomass
[1:51:13.840 --> 1:51:18.320]  burning cooking stove that only requires small quantities of sticks and twigs for fuel. The
[1:51:18.320 --> 1:51:23.600]  Minuteman stove is easy to use, smokeless portable powerful and sustainable for the finest in survival

[1:54:23.360 --> 1:54:27.280]  I agreed with everything Dr. Paul Craig Roberts just said. I'm about to go to your calls.
[1:54:28.240 --> 1:54:32.240]  I agree with all of it one thing. He said, oh, they seem to capitulate.
[1:54:33.360 --> 1:54:36.640]  And then they'll leave him alone. No, they're not going to do that. They want to destroy the idea
[1:54:36.640 --> 1:54:43.040]  of nationalism. They won't rest until he is dead or indicted or imprisoned. Hell, they all say they
[1:54:43.040 --> 1:54:48.720]  want him dead. It's the idea of nationalism. It's the idea of what he's criticized, their globalism.
[1:54:48.720 --> 1:54:53.760]  They have to do that. The answer is more nations rising up peacefully,
[1:54:53.760 --> 1:54:57.120]  politically and saying no to these bullies and not being part of globalism.
[1:54:58.800 --> 1:55:03.280]  And supporting Trump and communicating to him through Twitter and on the road and everywhere
[1:55:03.280 --> 1:55:07.600]  and not letting him be isolated so that he understands because here's the deal.
[1:55:09.360 --> 1:55:10.320]  They're never going to stop.
[1:55:13.040 --> 1:55:16.800]  They're never going to stop because they want the total power.
[1:55:16.800 --> 1:55:23.040]  They're totally crazed. They don't matter how dangerous it is or destroys the whole planet
[1:55:23.040 --> 1:55:29.120]  because there's still his agenda of jobs and borders and language and all the things the
[1:55:29.120 --> 1:55:33.280]  globalists hate. They're going to now start going after Trump on all that to see if they can bully
[1:55:33.280 --> 1:55:40.160]  him into submission. The Russians say we should have a border. You can't have one. I mean,
[1:55:40.160 --> 1:55:43.920]  it's basically come down to that. We should have new elections. They're saying of all the
[1:55:43.920 --> 1:55:49.440]  Republicans because they were all Russians. And it's like, excuse me, then you scratch the Democrats
[1:55:49.440 --> 1:55:56.480]  and it's just Russian connections everywhere. It's so insulting to have your honor challenge
[1:55:56.480 --> 1:56:00.560]  like that where they have Senate hearings. And when I was bashing and yelling the other day,
[1:56:00.560 --> 1:56:04.800]  I was talking about Shiv as the leader of the whole investigation. He's not even the bad one.
[1:56:04.800 --> 1:56:09.680]  Literally, it was the other hearings where they had the former head of the board of governors on,
[1:56:09.680 --> 1:56:14.720]  what was his name, Armstrong or something, going, Alex Jones is run by the Russians. It's like,
[1:56:15.680 --> 1:56:18.000]  how do they sit there and do that when they know it's pure bull?
[1:56:21.600 --> 1:56:24.960]  Nunez decision to leave a probe on Russia offers fresh start.
[1:56:27.200 --> 1:56:29.840]  And then tomorrow he'll be attacking the other members of the committee saying they've got to
[1:56:29.840 --> 1:56:36.720]  go too. Again, everything he does is about low attention span. Everything he does is tactical.
[1:56:36.720 --> 1:56:41.200]  And he's been the guy put in there to do it because he was a former U.S. attorney
[1:56:42.960 --> 1:56:47.120]  who's claimed to fame. I was looking it up with some somebody getting a bribe from the Russians
[1:56:47.120 --> 1:56:55.520]  or something. It just never ends. And the deep state doesn't want America to run its own country.
[1:56:58.240 --> 1:57:00.640]  I got Michael Schneider coming up. I'm going to go to your phone calls right now
[1:57:00.640 --> 1:57:03.760]  for a few more segments. Then we're going to air Paul Watson's special report,
[1:57:03.760 --> 1:57:07.200]  Petaphels rule the world. Just to understand the type of folks we're dealing with.
[1:57:07.760 --> 1:57:13.120]  All documented cases, all proven. Get ready. Pat in Ohio, Pat, you're on the air. Thanks for holding.
[1:57:14.640 --> 1:57:19.040]  Yes, sir. Thank you for taking my call. Thank you. I was wondering what it would take
[1:57:19.040 --> 1:57:25.200]  to declare victory against globalism and in the short term for America. And also,
[1:57:25.200 --> 1:57:29.200]  another quick part to the question is, how do you make people understand there's true
[1:57:29.200 --> 1:57:36.880]  evil in the world and where it comes from? Say true what? True evil. Oh, absolutely.
[1:57:36.880 --> 1:57:42.240]  Well, look at serial killers. Look at Stalin and Mao and Hitler and all the rest of it.
[1:57:42.240 --> 1:57:48.000]  They're control freaks. They're into raw power and into dark energy. But more of an awakening.
[1:57:48.000 --> 1:57:51.360]  I mean, we've already had such big victories. People know about the shadow government. They
[1:57:51.360 --> 1:57:55.120]  know about the fellow reserve being private. They know about globalism and corporate government.
[1:57:55.120 --> 1:58:01.440]  I mean, it's super unpopular. They have just gone to total war mode against anybody that tries to be
[1:58:01.440 --> 1:58:08.240]  a leader to then be a focal point to lead people to organize a better civilization. I mean, believe
[1:58:08.240 --> 1:58:20.640]  me, I'm attacked second only to Trump, maybe number three after Ben. And then I get mad at
[1:58:20.640 --> 1:58:24.160]  myself when I say things that can take out of context or whatever. I'm not perfect. I mean,
[1:58:24.160 --> 1:58:29.120]  it's incredibly stressful. I just do it because it's the right thing to do. But there's a selfish
[1:58:29.120 --> 1:58:33.280]  part of me, too. I just think, man, can I just get out of here with the family and just get
[1:58:33.920 --> 1:58:37.920]  to the southern hemisphere and just let everybody kill each other? But this war would be so big,
[1:58:37.920 --> 1:58:41.920]  it'll kill us down there, too. You just, you got to stand up against it, folks. I wish there was
[1:58:41.920 --> 1:58:46.320]  some new country to go to. I wish we could get out of this. We can't. We're going to have to deal with
[1:58:46.320 --> 1:58:55.360]  it. We're going to have to take our legs, folks. There was a mighty nation, rest above all of creation.
[1:58:55.360 --> 1:59:00.240]  Charlie Daniels, he's always loved America. Let me just read a little thing here. The American
[1:59:00.240 --> 1:59:05.200]  system of justice must be changed to conform to the rest of the world. Individual rights will
[1:59:05.200 --> 1:59:08.960]  have to take a backseat to the collective. Well, you know, the next boost is going to be,
[1:59:08.960 --> 1:59:13.440]  don't you? It's going to become a few guns. Oh, yeah. I take it ain't gonna sit well down my way
[1:59:13.440 --> 1:59:18.640]  at all. It ain't gonna sit well. Do you ever wonder what happened to America? They lost.
[1:59:18.640 --> 1:59:24.400]  We won. Want to see what drums up against. It's time to ride, boys. We need a thousand paul with
[1:59:24.400 --> 1:59:32.080]  beers. When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie. And beef
[1:59:32.080 --> 1:59:37.760]  was for supper. Revelation, dawn of global government, theatrical screenings on demand,
[1:59:37.760 --> 1:59:44.000]  DVDs now available, starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, special ops general Jerry Boykin.
[1:59:44.000 --> 1:59:50.560]  Want to shed some tears over the red, white and blue? Revelation, the movie.info. Let's fix it.
[1:59:53.120 --> 1:59:55.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:59:55.760 --> 2:00:02.720]  So
[2:00:20.960 --> 2:00:23.920]  Well, Stephen Mannan got removed from the national security council because he doesn't
[2:00:23.920 --> 2:00:32.960]  want to back Al Qaeda in Syria. I'm telling you, Rand Paul needs to be the top advisor
[2:00:34.240 --> 2:00:40.000]  and kind of the champion in the Senate for Trump. And he just needs to just work with Paul and just
[2:00:40.000 --> 2:00:44.720]  Paul has the medical doctor level knowledge of how this works. I'm really impressed with Rand
[2:00:44.720 --> 2:00:48.560]  Paul for four years in the Senate. Not so much good on the campaign trail, but man,
[2:00:48.560 --> 2:00:54.560]  when he knows tactically the right thing to do, we need Rand Paul drafted into the White House.
[2:00:54.560 --> 2:00:58.960]  That could really turn this around. I'm just, for all the leftists and globalists that are
[2:00:58.960 --> 2:01:04.880]  hoping to see this country go down, you're crazy. I mean, you're just crazy. I mean,
[2:01:04.880 --> 2:01:08.240]  you want a bad economy, you want all these wars, you want to ally with Islam. I mean,
[2:01:08.240 --> 2:01:13.040]  what is your problem, man? That they got imprinted and trained to hate America.
[2:01:13.840 --> 2:01:18.240]  And I used to hear like, leftist hated America, and I didn't believe it. I don't even know what
[2:01:18.240 --> 2:01:22.000]  to do anymore. I'm going to take your calls in the next segment here. A great point from the last
[2:01:22.000 --> 2:01:25.840]  caller, but you'll be on with us. And the next guest is going to be joining his caller. She'll
[2:01:25.840 --> 2:01:29.600]  be popping in while Michael Schneider is on it to break all this down. Nick in California,
[2:01:29.600 --> 2:01:37.280]  thanks for holding her on the air. Hey, Nick, how's it going? Great. I just wanted to say you
[2:01:37.280 --> 2:01:42.800]  hit the nail on the head earlier when you were talking about, they're never going to quit.
[2:01:42.800 --> 2:01:48.560]  And when you realize the reason why, and you realize why Trump is so powerful is because he's
[2:01:48.560 --> 2:01:53.600]  actually acknowledged the power of Jesus Christ in our nation again. And these people are wicked
[2:01:53.600 --> 2:01:57.440]  and they're just never going to stop, whether it's Trump. That's why they hate Russia now.
[2:01:57.440 --> 2:02:01.280]  And that's why they hate, you just hit it. It's God. We want to fix things, hit our knees before
[2:02:01.280 --> 2:02:05.280]  Christ, ask God for help, not the fake churches that are bought off and controlled, most of them.
[2:02:05.280 --> 2:02:08.800]  You're right. They hate Trump because he acknowledges Christ. They hate Russia because
[2:02:08.800 --> 2:02:12.800]  there's a Christian revival happening there. They hate Christians. It's just, it's a fact.
[2:02:14.080 --> 2:02:18.560]  Not to say that we don't all sin. I mean, we're all grown folks who can really acknowledge, you
[2:02:18.560 --> 2:02:24.160]  know, you know, little facts and true things. But we're tied into the real God, the God of life
[2:02:24.160 --> 2:02:27.920]  and everything good and the enemy. Look what they do. They're tied into evil. You're absolutely
[2:02:27.920 --> 2:02:32.720]  right. They hate us because they know our hearts are soft, that we love God. I can come up with
[2:02:32.720 --> 2:02:35.680]  really hard and hateful, but it's because I'm thinking about what they're doing to innocent
[2:02:35.680 --> 2:02:42.240]  people. And I do get over revved and over angry because it is real, but God judges the heart,
[2:02:42.240 --> 2:02:47.920]  doesn't he? And I'll tell you what, Alex, watching you for many years and seeing you go through your
[2:02:47.920 --> 2:02:53.600]  changes and what God has done in your life, you know, personally, as I witness you, I pray power
[2:02:53.600 --> 2:02:57.680]  in your life. And I thank you for being out there in the frontline and showing us, you know, what it
[2:02:57.680 --> 2:03:02.640]  is to struggle and actually keep going forward. And it wasn't actually until I was able to see
[2:03:02.640 --> 2:03:07.200]  Christ for myself in my relationship with my marriage and then I got better in the same thing
[2:03:07.200 --> 2:03:11.920]  in politics. If I get just as angry and bad as these people across the table from me, I ain't
[2:03:11.920 --> 2:03:15.680]  doing God any injustice. I'm not bringing... Well, that's what I've been praying to God is that I
[2:03:15.680 --> 2:03:20.160]  not get too angry because they use it against me and they take it out of context and we need to be
[2:03:20.160 --> 2:03:26.720]  strong and focused. And you're absolutely right. But you know, I just, the evil is so out in the
[2:03:26.720 --> 2:03:34.720]  open now, Nick. I do believe that it wasn't until I saw myself as someone I should invest
[2:03:34.720 --> 2:03:38.960]  something in, you know, through my Christ, but your supplements, actually, I heard you on earlier
[2:03:38.960 --> 2:03:47.200]  with Dr. Gru. And I take... I start off with my biome defense and then I take my brain force.
[2:03:48.000 --> 2:03:53.840]  The selenium was life-changing. I take... I'm staring at the oxy. I still doesn't know what
[2:03:53.840 --> 2:04:00.160]  that does yet. The B-12 is amazing. Your super male got me feeling young again. I don't even work
[2:04:00.160 --> 2:04:04.400]  out. I just came off the knee surgery and your supplements have changed my life. My wife texts
[2:04:04.400 --> 2:04:08.080]  me the first day we got the supplements in that she felt like an 18-year-old that you wanted to
[2:04:08.080 --> 2:04:12.720]  dance. They're real. Well, I gotta tell you, everything we promote is just missing link.
[2:04:12.720 --> 2:04:17.520]  A lot of it's really simple. A lot of it's really complex. But Israel, big studies out,
[2:04:18.160 --> 2:04:23.040]  now knows massive birth defects, brain damage in their kids. So Israel cares about their people
[2:04:23.040 --> 2:04:28.000]  and Israel's announcing a big push to get folks on iodine. Well, I hope they get people on good
[2:04:28.000 --> 2:04:33.440]  iodine. I don't care if it's people or Palestinians or Jews or Germans or whoever everybody is.
[2:04:33.440 --> 2:04:37.360]  Obviously, we want to make money to fund the operation, but we promote what's good. It's
[2:04:37.360 --> 2:04:43.360]  like this Vox article goes, they promote you need biome, you need stuff in your gut, good bacteria,
[2:04:43.360 --> 2:04:49.040]  and they make up a false crisis to sell it. Everybody, it's like almost 100% known that
[2:04:49.040 --> 2:04:53.440]  there's a gut crisis because of pesticides in the food killing your good bacteria and antibiotics
[2:04:53.440 --> 2:04:57.280]  and then you've got to replace them. Everybody knows yogurt and stuff's important. I mean,
[2:04:57.280 --> 2:05:18.720]  uh, we're not reinventing the wheel here.
[2:05:27.440 --> 2:05:31.120]  Representative Adam Schiff, Democrat member of the House Intelligence Committee,
[2:05:31.120 --> 2:05:35.600]  made a public statement moments after Nunes' announcement saying how pleased he was to
[2:05:35.600 --> 2:05:40.400]  hear of Nunes' recusal. So now the Democrats have a monopoly on the political witch hunt
[2:05:40.400 --> 2:05:44.160]  that is the Russian probe. Thanks, Nunes. The Republicans have gotten their leverage
[2:05:44.160 --> 2:05:49.120]  democratically and refused to use it. The Democrats get their leverage with smear campaigns and use
[2:05:49.120 --> 2:05:54.160]  it successfully. And if we keep allowing them to do it, they're going to continue. President Trump,
[2:05:54.160 --> 2:05:58.560]  the swamp is draining us. For Infowars.com, this is Owen Schreuer.

[2:07:58.560 --> 2:08:16.320]  Live from the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[2:08:28.560 --> 2:08:38.720]  How many times must I explain myself? Or I can talk to the boss? Or I can talk to the boss?
[2:08:38.720 --> 2:08:46.320]  We will never surrender to the globalist. It's a great song right here. I'll never get sick of this song.
[2:08:48.080 --> 2:08:54.320]  How many times must I say I love you? Oh, you finally understand.
[2:08:54.320 --> 2:09:03.520]  Eric Clapton bringing us in. What an incredible career from cream right through all the things he's done.
[2:09:03.520 --> 2:09:10.800]  Amazing. All right, joining us until the bottom of the hour is Michael Snyder. And then we're
[2:09:10.800 --> 2:09:18.000]  going to air pedophiles, rule the world special report from Paul Watson that only covers the
[2:09:18.000 --> 2:09:26.240]  confirmed mainstream news, world leaders, murdering children, torturing them to death,
[2:09:26.240 --> 2:09:31.520]  devil worship, you name it. It's only part one in 10 reports. He's going to file just
[2:09:31.520 --> 2:09:40.000]  chronicling all the admissions and the convictions. And he says at the beginning of it, you know,
[2:09:40.000 --> 2:09:44.080]  pizza gate has been discredited. No, not that they're using pizza code words. The media focused
[2:09:44.080 --> 2:09:48.560]  on one place. Some of us took the bait partially. Then they try to then have a referendum in the
[2:09:48.560 --> 2:09:55.840]  news saying pedophilia doesn't exist. Well, I picked up on it about four or five days into the story,
[2:09:55.840 --> 2:10:00.400]  pulled back from the beginning. MSM took that as a sign of weakness. And said, oh, look,
[2:10:00.400 --> 2:10:04.640]  he's been retracting and pulling back. Yeah, because I don't lie about people on purpose.
[2:10:04.640 --> 2:10:10.400]  I don't have malice of forethought or intended to harm of people that are innocent. If I can prove
[2:10:10.400 --> 2:10:15.520]  you're bad or done something, I'll come after you. But that's how Carl Rove used to set people up.
[2:10:15.520 --> 2:10:20.080]  Remember, he would have a big data mind of real news, but put this info in the middle of it.
[2:10:20.080 --> 2:10:25.920]  So that's coming up at about 35 after or so. Michael Snyder, of course, reaches millions of
[2:10:25.920 --> 2:10:32.480]  people a week. He has an amazing website, economic collapse blog.com. He's got others.
[2:10:32.480 --> 2:10:36.240]  And he just takes all the news, all the Intel mainstream news, alternative news,
[2:10:36.240 --> 2:10:43.280]  legislation, video clips, and weaves them together so that you can get a picture of
[2:10:43.280 --> 2:10:46.640]  what's coming. And he's been laying out the trigger in the Middle East and Syria,
[2:10:46.640 --> 2:10:50.880]  the trigger in the South China Sea, the trigger of the Democrats trying to push COG,
[2:10:52.080 --> 2:10:56.560]  and the mainline analysts across the board are saying, this is how World War start.
[2:10:57.120 --> 2:11:02.240]  And I had Dr. Paul Craig Robertson, former head of policy at the Treasury, part of the
[2:11:02.240 --> 2:11:07.520]  big fall of the Soviet Union, negotiated that. Really smart guy, concurring that this is the most
[2:11:07.520 --> 2:11:13.680]  dangerous time ever for humanity. Rand Paul's saying that. We've had so many others on,
[2:11:13.680 --> 2:11:18.160]  breaking that down. This is such an incredible time with all of this. And then to see them
[2:11:18.160 --> 2:11:22.720]  trying to kill Trump's global recovery initiative, when globalism is meant to make you poor.
[2:11:23.840 --> 2:11:27.440]  Well, true nationalism coming back, we'll make everybody wealthier. It'll create competition.
[2:11:27.440 --> 2:11:33.440]  And not with the elites, fixed prices, and lower wages. And to see the left cheerleading,
[2:11:33.440 --> 2:11:39.600]  and Schumer, I'll put the clip in a moment, saying that Trump's like an idiotic 98-pound
[2:11:39.600 --> 2:11:45.600]  weakling before the Chinese. To see how un-American they are, and to see them rooting for our fall,
[2:11:45.600 --> 2:11:50.160]  I wonder what's going on with some American people that buy into this. But here's the news,
[2:11:50.160 --> 2:11:53.920]  we know the polls are fake. They've always been 15, 20 points against Trump.
[2:11:53.920 --> 2:11:59.760]  So Trump is still very, very popular, but he is now faltering with the neocons he's put in,
[2:11:59.760 --> 2:12:03.280]  and in the military positions. I was hoping they just followed neocon orders. They're
[2:12:03.280 --> 2:12:08.800]  continuing all the neocon stuff now that this batch of generals got in. And they are just full
[2:12:08.800 --> 2:12:12.720]  steam ahead with rack and ruin, ladies and gentlemen. So here to talk about the nightmare
[2:12:12.720 --> 2:12:18.880]  scenarios, not to fearmonger, but to let the public know what's happening to turn this around is
[2:12:18.880 --> 2:12:24.480]  Michael Schneider. Michael, wow, what a time to be alive. Oh, definitely, Alex. And actually,
[2:12:24.480 --> 2:12:29.920]  I'm more alarmed now than I've been in well over a year. The situation, the global situation with
[2:12:29.920 --> 2:12:34.320]  Trump, we thought it was all going to be about domestic policy, about the economy. But instead,
[2:12:34.320 --> 2:12:39.200]  foreign policies become in front and center this week with the situation with North Korea,
[2:12:39.200 --> 2:12:43.760]  where CNN says the White House officials said time has now run out on the North Korea
[2:12:43.760 --> 2:12:49.200]  nuclear program, and that they said all options are on the table. And this is a phrase that has
[2:12:49.200 --> 2:12:53.840]  been used repeatedly by members of the Trump administration. And basically what it is, it's
[2:12:53.840 --> 2:13:00.000]  a threat of war to North Korea saying if you keep trying to get an ICBM, which could hit the United
[2:13:00.000 --> 2:13:04.880]  States, we are going to strike you militarily. So they are openly threatening North Korea with
[2:13:04.880 --> 2:13:10.480]  war. Of course, Trump is meeting with the president of China this week, you know, right here at the
[2:13:10.480 --> 2:13:14.720]  end of this week, and China is going to try to buy some time because they don't want the US to
[2:13:14.720 --> 2:13:20.080]  strike North Korea. But people need to understand this isn't like Afghanistan or Iraq or Libya,
[2:13:20.080 --> 2:13:24.720]  it's a totally different animal. Because North Korea, they've got the fourth largest military
[2:13:24.720 --> 2:13:30.160]  on the entire planet, and they've got nukes, they've got nuclear weapons, and they're not afraid to
[2:13:30.160 --> 2:13:35.040]  use them. And they've got brainwashed fighters that we learned about in 1950 that will do whatever
[2:13:35.040 --> 2:13:40.080]  they're told in a fight to the death. They do. I mean, this is a society they're absolutely
[2:13:40.080 --> 2:13:44.640]  obsessed with the destruction of the United States is one of the central pillars of their society.
[2:13:44.640 --> 2:13:48.720]  And so if we strike them, if we were to go to war, and Trump, you know, a lot of people are
[2:13:48.720 --> 2:13:53.920]  used to politicians making pledges and promises and threats that they never carry out, you know,
[2:13:53.920 --> 2:13:58.560]  like Obama, he would threaten other nations, but then actually never do anything. I believe that
[2:13:58.560 --> 2:14:03.520]  Donald Trump means what he says. And so when he says time has run out, all options are on the table.
[2:14:03.520 --> 2:14:07.440]  I believe that he's actually considering a military strike on North Korea. Now,
[2:14:07.440 --> 2:14:11.200]  they said they are. They've said they are. And top generals have said it may be the only option.
[2:14:11.200 --> 2:14:16.560]  And I understand even what they're saying. The issue is, why did our elites do this A and then
[2:14:16.560 --> 2:14:22.000]  B? How this goes down is they start fueling those rockets, put an A bomb on there. We hit it.
[2:14:23.360 --> 2:14:28.720]  They then attack Seoul, hundreds of thousands of troops pour across. They launch another missile
[2:14:29.680 --> 2:14:34.960]  at Seoul with an atomic weapon. Who knows? Then instantly, we respond with nukes, boom,
[2:14:34.960 --> 2:14:41.520]  China comes in, you'll wake up dead. The hydrogen bombs will rain down at 2 a.m. 30 minutes after
[2:14:41.520 --> 2:14:46.640]  this starts, and you'll even, you'll never even know what hit you. Yeah, this could be the spark
[2:14:46.640 --> 2:14:51.840]  of World War Three. And so people need to understand because the instant we strike North Korea,
[2:14:51.840 --> 2:14:56.080]  they're going to start firing back. Now they've got thousands of artillery pieces of rockets
[2:14:56.080 --> 2:15:03.280]  trained on South Korea. 100,000 artillery pieces. Yeah. And they've got that one of the biggest
[2:15:03.280 --> 2:15:08.480]  stockpiles of chemical warheads on the entire planet. So even if somehow we got all their nukes,
[2:15:08.480 --> 2:15:13.760]  there would still be nerve gas warheads, hundreds of the hundreds and hundreds in Seoul and other
[2:15:13.760 --> 2:15:20.080]  major South Korean cities, possibly even in Japan, Tokyo. And then if we don't get every single one
[2:15:20.080 --> 2:15:23.520]  of their nukes, if we don't get every single one of their nukes, they're going to start firing
[2:15:23.520 --> 2:15:29.280]  what they have left at US military bases in Japan. Possibly, could you imagine a new
[2:15:29.280 --> 2:15:34.640]  hitting Tokyo or hitting Seoul? I mean, we're talking about an apocalyptic event. And plus,
[2:15:34.640 --> 2:15:38.400]  as you mentioned, instantly, what would happen? We strike North Korea, they're going to launch
[2:15:38.400 --> 2:15:43.440]  an invasion of South Korea. And thousands upon thousands of troops are going to start pouring
[2:15:43.440 --> 2:15:47.520]  across the border because North Korea has a vastly larger military than South Korea.
[2:15:47.520 --> 2:15:52.960]  The only way that South Korea could survive is if the US intervened militarily on a massive
[2:15:52.960 --> 2:15:57.520]  scale with ground troops. And then as you said, you know, nukes could get involved, China could
[2:15:57.520 --> 2:16:03.040]  come in. And then just like the 1950s, the Chinese come in. Yeah, yeah, just like the original Korean
[2:16:03.040 --> 2:16:08.240]  War, where we had won the Korean War, North Korea was defeated, but then Chinese troops started
[2:16:08.240 --> 2:16:15.280]  pouring across the border. Because China, they want, China has an uneasy relationship with North
[2:16:15.280 --> 2:16:21.200]  Korea, but they want North Korea to survive. They like that North Korea is a thorn in the
[2:16:21.200 --> 2:16:25.520]  side of the United States. So China desperately does not want the US to attack North Korea. And
[2:16:25.520 --> 2:16:29.840]  if we do attack them, our relationship with China is essentially over. It's going to be-
[2:16:29.840 --> 2:16:33.680]  By the way, that's the good scenario. As you know, most analysts believe this will probably
[2:16:33.680 --> 2:16:39.520]  lead to a full scale nuclear war within hours. Yeah. And so that's the nightmare scenario.
[2:16:39.520 --> 2:16:46.640]  At a minimum, at a minimum, we could see millions of people die in either South Korea and Seoul in
[2:16:46.640 --> 2:16:52.320]  Japan. And so at a minimum, we could see our relationships with South Korea and Japan,
[2:16:52.320 --> 2:16:56.560]  because they would blame us. If something goes bad and their cities start getting hit with nuclear
[2:16:56.560 --> 2:17:00.960]  or chemical weapons, nerve gas, they're going to blame us. And our relationship with Japan and
[2:17:00.960 --> 2:17:09.760]  South Korea could be damaged forever. So I don't know that we can't let North Korea get ICBMs,
[2:17:09.760 --> 2:17:14.000]  which could threaten our mainland. But on the other hand, I don't see how an attack on North
[2:17:14.000 --> 2:17:18.720]  Korea could go well. How it could be done successfully. The problem is they keep shooting
[2:17:18.720 --> 2:17:22.240]  missiles at Japan, threatening to nuke everybody. I mean, we have a right to respond. Quite frankly,
[2:17:22.240 --> 2:17:24.960]  you point a gun at somebody and say, I'm going to blow your head off. Then you start shooting at
[2:17:24.960 --> 2:17:28.560]  the ground right by their foot, like Japan. I mean, I expect Japan to start attacking and
[2:17:28.560 --> 2:17:32.240]  they've got a formidable defense force. But expanding on that, then Michael Schneider,
[2:17:32.240 --> 2:17:38.480]  the economic collapse blog. How does the economy come into all this? And then how does starting
[2:17:39.040 --> 2:17:42.560]  another war in the Middle East are going up against the Russians in Syria with this clear
[2:17:42.560 --> 2:17:48.960]  false flag that Ron Paul's talking about that we broke yesterday? I mean, it just seems like madness.
[2:17:48.960 --> 2:17:54.640]  It is madness. And I'm so alarmed that the Trump administration seems to be falling for this,
[2:17:54.640 --> 2:18:00.080]  because they tried it several times. The rebel forces in Syria tried this several times while
[2:18:00.080 --> 2:18:04.880]  Obama was in office, a false flag, a chemical attack against their own people to try to get
[2:18:04.880 --> 2:18:10.160]  the sympathy of the world to try to draw the United States into the war in Syria. And Obama,
[2:18:10.160 --> 2:18:15.840]  you know, you know, protested, but he never actually committed our forces there. But I guess
[2:18:15.840 --> 2:18:20.240]  they figured it was worth a try with Trump. And Trump appears to be falling for it. And it deeply
[2:18:20.240 --> 2:18:24.960]  alarmed me when Trump got up in front of the press and he said, Hey, for me, that crosses many,
[2:18:24.960 --> 2:18:29.520]  many lines. In fact, he said that that goes beyond a red line. Well, at the same time,
[2:18:29.520 --> 2:18:34.480]  he's criticizing Obama for saying red line and then I never actually do I gotta tell you he's
[2:18:34.480 --> 2:18:39.200]  got these generals in there. I don't I'm not I just don't want my kids to die. And I get we've
[2:18:39.200 --> 2:18:43.120]  got to be strong to China. And I disagree with Roberts where he's like, Oh, China's not evil.
[2:18:43.120 --> 2:18:48.560]  Give me a break. China's completely out of control. Our elite have armed these people.
[2:18:48.560 --> 2:18:51.360]  They've propped them up. They gave them all our jobs. That's why I hate our elite more than the
[2:18:51.360 --> 2:18:56.480]  Chinese Communist. I'm just sick sick of it. Why create this world? I've studied everything they've
[2:18:56.480 --> 2:19:02.400]  done. And it's all self serving crap for bigger mansions. And then endangering the world. And
[2:19:02.400 --> 2:19:07.200]  then when these forces come together, the very people that put them into motion stand around
[2:19:07.200 --> 2:19:11.680]  like our heroes, wanting the end of the planet. So they can act like they've got the biggest,
[2:19:11.680 --> 2:19:17.600]  you know, we we's, I mean, I'm just tired of it. Yeah, these neo cons are literally insane. And
[2:19:17.600 --> 2:19:21.840]  it's all about money and power and wealth and all the things you talked about. But people like
[2:19:21.840 --> 2:19:26.000]  McMaster, they seem to be becoming more prominent in the Trump administration, they're getting into
[2:19:26.000 --> 2:19:31.360]  his ear, he's surrounded by these generals, these hawks, these neo cons, all they all jack each other
[2:19:31.360 --> 2:19:34.720]  up, they'll get each other up, you know, sir, we've got all these secret weapons and all this
[2:19:34.720 --> 2:19:39.040]  ready. It doesn't matter if 2% of the Russian weapons get through the Chinese, we're all dead.
[2:19:39.840 --> 2:19:46.000]  You can't do it. And oh, man, I'm so tired of it. I mean, it's just, I'll just say this,
[2:19:46.000 --> 2:19:49.360]  then if Trump's going to do it, he should just pre strike them. I mean, that's only chance we've
[2:19:49.360 --> 2:19:53.440]  got if he's going to be psychotic, then hit him first, like Curtis LeMay said, should have done
[2:19:53.440 --> 2:19:58.080]  this a long time ago, though, should have done this in the 1950s, man. We were going to destroy
[2:19:58.080 --> 2:20:01.600]  the Russians and the Chinese should have been done them. And I'm not advocating that we use cell

[2:24:08.960 --> 2:24:13.840]  not called that in Russia but it would destroy an entire surface area of Texas or France.
[2:24:13.840 --> 2:24:17.760]  We can put that on screen for TV viewers and then while Michael Snyder speaking I'm going to go to
[2:24:17.760 --> 2:24:22.320]  your calls after he leaves us in a special report from Paul Watson we're going to show you a Google
[2:24:22.320 --> 2:24:28.720]  Maps own historic megaton test ranges and what even weapons in the 60s would do but Russia unveils
[2:24:28.720 --> 2:24:34.880]  Satan 2 missile and they could wipe out France or Texas with the type of megaton weapons it carries
[2:24:34.880 --> 2:24:38.640]  multiple ones by the way and of course there's a lot more advanced stuff than that they admitted
[2:24:38.640 --> 2:24:44.720]  the Air Force by the 90s developed anti-matter bombs that would destroy if they theoretically
[2:24:44.720 --> 2:24:50.000]  tested them they would destroy most of the solar system. So what's the point of that? I don't know
[2:24:50.000 --> 2:24:55.280]  but we're reaching that Atlantis moment whether Atlantis existed or not in the fable of Atlantis
[2:24:55.280 --> 2:25:00.560]  the legend they get some super technology that blows the whole island up and Plato lived only
[2:25:00.560 --> 2:25:04.720]  you know a few thousand years after he said no he had the annals the books about it happened and some
[2:25:04.720 --> 2:25:10.080]  Atlanteans were on ships you know and came back to Greece and Greece was probably founded by
[2:25:10.800 --> 2:25:16.000]  people just fragments of the Atlantean memory but whether that was real or not folks we're now at
[2:25:16.000 --> 2:25:20.560]  the Atlantis moment Michael Snyder you know I don't know if you have kids I have children especially
[2:25:20.560 --> 2:25:25.280]  my little daughters and I see this news and I see how sweet they are and it really makes me angry.
[2:25:26.880 --> 2:25:31.440]  Yeah I don't want war either Alex and that's why I'm so alarmed by what's happened this week we
[2:25:31.440 --> 2:25:35.520]  already talked about how North Korea could potentially spark a war with China well the
[2:25:35.520 --> 2:25:39.840]  situation with Syria if it was just Syria wouldn't be that big of a deal and and Trump could do whatever
[2:25:39.840 --> 2:25:44.400]  he wanted if it was just Syria but the Russians are there and the Russians are mixed in among the
[2:25:44.400 --> 2:25:49.040]  Syrian forces and that they're at the Syrian air bases in particular so if Trump Trump with
[2:25:49.040 --> 2:25:52.880]  his words and the members of his administration recent days they've kind of committed themselves
[2:25:52.880 --> 2:25:58.000]  to taking some sort of action in response to this false flag chemical attack but they've kind of
[2:25:58.000 --> 2:26:02.000]  committed themselves but if they do anything and the bombs start dropping and the Russians
[2:26:02.720 --> 2:26:06.640]  their people are being killed their forces under threat are the Russians just going to sit there
[2:26:06.640 --> 2:26:10.720]  and do nothing or are they going to respond I believe the Russians would start respond they
[2:26:10.720 --> 2:26:16.240]  would start shooting back and so what happens if okay US war planes go in they start bombing
[2:26:16.240 --> 2:26:20.960]  and then Russian missiles the s 300 starts taking US airplanes out we start seeing
[2:26:21.600 --> 2:26:26.560]  F-16s fall out of the sky on CNN what's that going to do to the anti-russian hysteria in
[2:26:26.560 --> 2:26:31.920]  Washington that's already at Cold War heights I mean it's just going to be insane but you had
[2:26:31.920 --> 2:26:37.440]  this situation and of course we've got Iran in Syria we've got Hezbollah in Syria and so if we
[2:26:37.440 --> 2:26:42.800]  go to war with Syria it's going to make the civil war even worse if they can't dig out al-Qaeda and
[2:26:42.800 --> 2:26:47.360]  ISIS they're gonna have even more trouble digging out all the Iranians that are in there yeah and
[2:26:47.360 --> 2:26:51.920]  there's nothing to be gained in there as Trump has been saying for so long there's nothing to be
[2:26:51.920 --> 2:26:56.640]  gained for us to go into Syria just so the Iranians that say what five times better fighters what
[2:26:56.640 --> 2:27:03.440]  militaries told me than the al-Qaeda people yeah and so you know there's so much that could go wrong
[2:27:03.440 --> 2:27:07.680]  we don't want to conflict with Iran we don't even want to hunt conflict with Hezbollah they're
[2:27:07.680 --> 2:27:13.040]  pretty serious but especially with Russia our relationship with Russia is already quite tenuous
[2:27:13.040 --> 2:27:18.880]  and if we go in and and and by dead bodies of Russian servicemembers start showing up on Russian
[2:27:18.880 --> 2:27:23.680]  television you know the Russians are going to totally turn against Trump any hope and they've
[2:27:23.680 --> 2:27:28.480]  got former generals going what we need Russian body bags that'll teach them which which historically
[2:27:28.480 --> 2:27:32.480]  that doesn't work with any powerful country it's never worked with Russia like you kill Russians
[2:27:32.480 --> 2:27:38.880]  they're gonna just gonna crap their pants yeah Russia doesn't back down Russia is not intimidated
[2:27:38.880 --> 2:27:45.040]  by anyone the Russians historically are fighters and and so you know we had hoped that Trump coming
[2:27:45.040 --> 2:27:49.040]  in we could have a better relationship with Russia but this thing with Syria could actually make it
[2:27:49.040 --> 2:27:53.120]  far far worse well he better listen to Rand Paul I mean didn't Rand Paul the hero of the moment
[2:27:53.920 --> 2:27:58.960]  I mean he's there saying stop it Trump do not do this do not back al-Qaeda we need the military
[2:27:58.960 --> 2:28:04.800]  everybody to start tweeting the photos again I'm sorry at Trump you know I will not back a a air
[2:28:04.800 --> 2:28:09.840]  force a bombardment of Syria for al-Qaeda because that's al-Qaeda slash ISIS same group and you
[2:28:09.840 --> 2:28:14.640]  know here it is we gotta give the president the political support he needs to make the right
[2:28:14.640 --> 2:28:20.320]  decisions so they're gonna bully him and say he's for nerve-gassing little kids yeah my regard for
[2:28:20.320 --> 2:28:25.440]  Rand Paul has gone way up not only because of this but because of the Obamacare thing and everything
[2:28:25.440 --> 2:28:30.160]  else so I'm so glad that he's standing up for the truth but you know with the situation in Syria
[2:28:30.160 --> 2:28:35.760]  it was started back in 2011 Arab Spring was going on and so Hillary Clinton who is Secretary of
[2:28:35.760 --> 2:28:41.200]  State at the time got together with Saudi Arabia and Turkey and she did and then they blame Trump
[2:28:42.000 --> 2:28:46.560]  they're in the news now saying this is all his fault what the they blame Obamacare on him
[2:28:47.920 --> 2:28:52.400]  it's insane but it was originally hatched by Hillary Clinton Saudi Arabia and Turkey and they
[2:28:52.400 --> 2:28:57.520]  were funding and supporting the rebels trying to overthrow Assad and and so that was their plan
[2:28:57.520 --> 2:29:03.440]  all along to to take Syria from the Iranian axis of power and turn it into a full-fledged Sunni
[2:29:03.440 --> 2:29:08.640]  nation aligned with Saudi Arabia and Turkey and so they that's been the whole goal all along
[2:29:11.840 --> 2:29:15.920]  yeah and at first it was working but then in came Russia and Iran and Hezbollah turn the
[2:29:15.920 --> 2:29:21.600]  tide of the war and so now the rebels are about to lose and the only way the only thing that could
[2:29:21.600 --> 2:29:26.080]  turn the tide of the war is the intervention of the western powers and then it was crazy our
[2:29:26.080 --> 2:29:31.040]  military is in there knocking out Al Qaeda and ISIS because Trump demanded that he's not getting
[2:29:31.040 --> 2:29:35.520]  the generals are there now sir this next move because they followed his orders there his next
[2:29:35.520 --> 2:29:41.280]  move is to basically bring down the whole country uh michael schneider the economic class blog.com
[2:29:41.280 --> 2:29:46.720]  thank you so much sir thank you folks you cannot hype this up enough how dangerous this is coming
[2:29:46.720 --> 2:29:51.360]  up Paul watch this special report your phone calls and a lot more on alex jones we're on the march
[2:29:51.360 --> 2:29:56.480]  the empire's on the run we were on the march alex jones and the gc we're getting stuck at the matter
[2:29:56.480 --> 2:30:04.960]  right now folks while the swamp is competitive in the political battle it does seem the cultural
[2:30:04.960 --> 2:30:10.720]  swamp is being drained Shia LaBeouf's most recent film man down had a blockbuster opening day with a
[2:30:10.720 --> 2:30:15.840]  huge ticket sale yes one ticket since opening night last weekend ticket sales have totaled a
[2:30:15.840 --> 2:30:20.960]  whopping three he's had more flags stolen than ticket sales so Shia's childish antics on the
[2:30:20.960 --> 2:30:25.920]  streets earned him more attention than his actual job meanwhile in style magazine had to publish a

[2:30:46.560 --> 2:30:52.160]  on twitter called who's the worst and Amy Schumer won the people have spoken Amy Schumer is the

[2:33:28.160 --> 2:33:31.680]  you know i don't want to cover this whole pedophile subject because it makes my skin
[2:33:31.680 --> 2:33:39.440]  crawl but all these lines mainstream news judges you name it have come out and said no it's
[2:33:39.440 --> 2:33:44.080]  it's international rings of rich people doing horrible things so michael stoner i appreciate
[2:33:44.080 --> 2:33:49.440]  you holding over just to give a quick comment on just in general the elites and and and and
[2:33:49.440 --> 2:33:55.200]  what drives them from your deep research what do you think's behind all this this raw lust for power
[2:33:55.200 --> 2:34:00.160]  it's beyond nihilism it's like we must rule or we'll die trying and then selfishly destroy the
[2:34:00.160 --> 2:34:07.440]  planet yeah the elite feel like they're smarter than everyone else so and the the elite feel like
[2:34:07.440 --> 2:34:12.160]  they were born to rule that they have a right to rule and that they know better than everyone else
[2:34:12.160 --> 2:34:16.240]  some of them actually consider themselves kind of benevolent dictators that they know what the
[2:34:16.240 --> 2:34:20.960]  world should do and so they're going to impose that but and and i believe that right now they're
[2:34:20.960 --> 2:34:25.600]  setting up trump on multiple levels not only for war but here with the government the whole
[2:34:25.600 --> 2:34:31.280]  government situation you know alex the congress is about to go on a two-week recess in which you
[2:34:31.280 --> 2:34:35.040]  know who gets two weeks off or east or i guess congress does but when they come back there's
[2:34:35.040 --> 2:34:39.920]  going to be one week that they have to avoid a government shutdown and and and and if they
[2:34:39.920 --> 2:34:44.720]  don't get something done the government will shut down on april 29th now can they get that done in a
[2:34:44.720 --> 2:34:49.360]  week i don't think so for multiple reasons if playing parenthood dozens of other things that
[2:34:49.360 --> 2:34:53.280]  need to be the democrats are totally obstructionist like this new trump thing to say i'm going to
[2:34:53.280 --> 2:34:59.280]  work with democrats what yeah and but the democrats have no intention of it having in fact i think
[2:34:59.280 --> 2:35:03.360]  the democrats actually want a government shutdown because it's going to make trump and the republicans
[2:35:03.360 --> 2:35:08.080]  look bad so they're perfectly fine to just sit back and let the government shut down and so trump
[2:35:08.080 --> 2:35:12.480]  and the republicans need to get together and but then the thing is to get it through the senate
[2:35:12.480 --> 2:35:16.480]  they're going to need the democrat help because the democrats and they're going to be hunting for
[2:35:16.480 --> 2:35:24.400]  ruskies that that were there actually on the payroll in one minute what can citizens do well
[2:35:24.400 --> 2:35:28.320]  we need to continue to fight the information war like never before particularly this thing with the
[2:35:28.320 --> 2:35:33.760]  war we've been talking about this past half hour we need to scream bloody murder for trump not to do
[2:35:33.760 --> 2:35:39.440]  this because everyone watching just like in 2013 we are not al-qaeda's air force yeah you know when
[2:35:39.440 --> 2:35:45.920]  obama was considering in 2013 the public really screamed bloody murder we don't want this we don't
[2:35:45.920 --> 2:35:50.160]  want war with syria we need to do the same thing but even louder so trump will hear us

[2:36:18.880 --> 2:36:23.680]  attack but but it's starting to really accelerate exponentially now logarithmically

[2:38:00.720 --> 2:38:05.440]  so now pizza gates being debunked that must mean that anyone who talks about the connections
[2:38:05.440 --> 2:38:11.600]  between pedophilia and people in positions of power must be a crazy extremist conspiracy theorist
[2:38:11.600 --> 2:38:18.160]  right wrong in virtually every major pedophile bust in every major country in the world top
[2:38:18.160 --> 2:38:24.320]  politicians judges celebrities billionaires and other members of the establishment are always
[2:38:24.320 --> 2:38:31.600]  connected conspiracy theory okay let's take a look in 2008 financier jeffrey epstein whose friends
[2:38:31.600 --> 2:38:37.440]  included some of the most powerful people on the planet was convicted of soliciting an underage girl
[2:38:37.440 --> 2:38:42.480]  for prostitution according to fox news epstein quote allegedly had a team of traffickers who
[2:38:42.480 --> 2:38:49.440]  procured girls as young as 12 to service his friends on orgy island an estate on epstein's 72
[2:38:49.440 --> 2:38:55.520]  acre island called little st james in the u.s virgin islands why did bill clinton take at least
[2:38:55.520 --> 2:39:03.040]  26 trips on the lily to express epstein's jet ditching his secret service detail for five of
[2:39:03.040 --> 2:39:08.640]  those trips a jet accusers say was equipped for sex with underage victims and was used to travel to
[2:39:08.640 --> 2:39:13.920]  epstein's private island nicknamed orgy island newly obtained documents show clinton actually
[2:39:13.920 --> 2:39:19.520]  took at least 26 flights on epstein's private jet to spots around the globe though apparently
[2:39:19.520 --> 2:39:25.520]  not after epstein's plea deal and jail time on at least five occasions that they did travel together
[2:39:25.520 --> 2:39:32.080]  secret service did not accompany clinton you don't just dismiss secret service detail paperwork
[2:39:32.080 --> 2:39:38.240]  has to be filed there's an accounting of why the dismissal in this case there isn't paperwork and the
[2:39:38.240 --> 2:39:43.360]  secret service is not responding to the foyer request why did clinton choose to continue his
[2:39:43.360 --> 2:39:48.080]  association with epstein when according to the alliance to rescue victims of trafficking
[2:39:48.640 --> 2:39:55.840]  everyone within his inner circles knew he was a pedophile why did epstein have 21 different
[2:39:55.840 --> 2:40:01.440]  phone numbers for bill clinton who were the prominent people epstein reportedly blackmailed
[2:40:01.440 --> 2:40:07.280]  by secretly recording them with these underage girls who are the quote powerful associates
[2:40:07.280 --> 2:40:13.520]  named by victim virginia robert's that u.s. authorities allegedly have on tape having sex
[2:40:13.520 --> 2:40:20.320]  with underage girls why did jeffrey epstein serve just 13 months in jail for his crimes
[2:40:20.320 --> 2:40:26.720]  were epstein and his friends linked to another elite child sex trafficking network one recently
[2:40:26.720 --> 2:40:33.280]  exposed by a woman named kendall on dr. phil's show kendall spoke about private parties and
[2:40:33.280 --> 2:40:38.480]  islands where she and other children would be taken to be tortured and raped by high ranking
[2:40:38.480 --> 2:40:45.280]  law enforcement officials major sports figures and top u.s. politicians my whole life i traveled
[2:40:45.280 --> 2:40:50.560]  all over the world and would go to some of the biggest events to meet clients and have sex with
[2:40:50.560 --> 2:40:56.960]  them they were all extremely rich and prominent members of society the man who owns me is smart
[2:40:56.960 --> 2:41:03.040]  and rich he has connections with very powerful people all over the world who were these people
[2:41:03.040 --> 2:41:09.120]  is she referring to epstein's orgy island i can tell you that a very reliable source
[2:41:09.120 --> 2:41:16.480]  has confirmed to us that kendall has in fact been trafficked raped molested and severely abused
[2:41:17.200 --> 2:41:23.920]  by a very large very dangerous organization in 2010 laura sillsby former director of the
[2:41:23.920 --> 2:41:29.920]  new life children's refuge was arrested for attempting to traffic 33 children out of Haiti
[2:41:29.920 --> 2:41:35.920]  sillsby's lawyer and his wife were later arrested on suspicion of involvement in an international
[2:41:35.920 --> 2:41:41.520]  human trafficking ring why did bill clinton intervene to secure the release of all of
[2:41:41.520 --> 2:41:47.600]  sillsby's co-conspirators why did clinton help get sillsby's sentence reduced from conspiracy
[2:41:47.600 --> 2:41:53.760]  and child abduction to just quote arranging irregular travel why were sillsby's charges
[2:41:53.760 --> 2:42:00.640]  reduced just three days after clinton landed in Haiti why was hillary clinton interested in the
[2:42:00.640 --> 2:42:07.120]  case last year former child actor and lord of the ring star elijah wood said powerful figures in
[2:42:07.120 --> 2:42:13.200]  the movie business were protecting pedophiles who were these monsters that prayed upon children
[2:42:13.200 --> 2:42:20.560]  at hollywood parties how many famous faces are among the 100 active pedophiles in hollywood
[2:42:20.560 --> 2:42:27.040]  referenced by anhenry are they the same predators who abused corrie feldman and other child actors
[2:42:27.040 --> 2:42:32.640]  in the 1980s i can tell you that the number one problem in hollywood was and is and always will
[2:42:32.640 --> 2:42:39.360]  be pedophilia there was a circle of older men that surrounded themselves around this group of kids
[2:42:39.360 --> 2:42:46.240]  does this hollywood pedo cult stretch back to the 70s when roman polanski was arrested for having
[2:42:46.240 --> 2:42:53.040]  sex with a 13 year old girl before fleeing america why have prominent politicians and hollywood
[2:42:53.040 --> 2:43:01.600]  heavyweights like merrill street consistently defended polanski a fugitive pedophile um yes uh
[2:43:01.600 --> 2:43:08.320]  roman polanski i'm very sorry then he's in jail in 2012 it was revealed that british entertainer
[2:43:08.320 --> 2:43:14.560]  jimmy savill had sexually abused hundreds of young children for decades who among those in
[2:43:14.560 --> 2:43:20.800]  the british establishment that savill was so close to knew about his activities who were the other
[2:43:20.800 --> 2:43:27.360]  masked participants in savill satanic ceremonies during which children were raped who were the
[2:43:27.360 --> 2:43:33.040]  other participants during another satanic abuse ceremony that took place on a quote wealthy
[2:43:33.040 --> 2:43:39.920]  london street why was savills connection with what mp tom watson called quote a powerful pedophile
[2:43:39.920 --> 2:43:45.920]  network linked to parliament and number 10 not properly investigated how come knowledge of
[2:43:45.920 --> 2:43:53.760]  savills abuse of children was circulating as far back as 1978 and yet he remained free for over
[2:43:53.760 --> 2:44:03.440]  three decades jimmy savill i think he's a hypocrite i bet he's into all kinds of seediness that we all
[2:44:03.440 --> 2:44:09.440]  know about but are not allowed to talk about i know some rumors i'll bet none of this will be
[2:44:09.440 --> 2:44:17.840]  allowed out the fact that in 1978 at the height of the sex pistols explosion there you are saying
[2:44:17.840 --> 2:44:23.360]  about jimmy savill he was into all kinds of seediness that we all knew about we weren't allowed to
[2:44:23.360 --> 2:44:29.200]  talk about it i know some rumors so you you had heard the kind of thing that we now know about him
[2:44:29.200 --> 2:44:35.520]  or or stuff like that yeah i found myself being banned from bbc radio there for quite a while
[2:44:35.520 --> 2:44:42.640]  for my contentious behavior why did the bbc cancel a news night investigation into the abuse that
[2:44:42.640 --> 2:44:50.400]  was set to air in 2011 after savills death was tv presenter gildando professionally murdered
[2:44:50.400 --> 2:44:57.600]  because she was about to expose quote big name stars at the bbc who were involved in the abuse
[2:44:57.600 --> 2:45:05.760]  why was an innocent mentally unstable man blamed for gildando's murder and locked up for seven years
[2:45:05.760 --> 2:45:13.200]  on flimsy evidence in 2014 london police publicly said they believed allegations that quote a ring
[2:45:13.200 --> 2:45:18.320]  of prominent politicians and members of the establishment abused and terrorized children
[2:45:18.320 --> 2:45:24.880]  as young as seven more than 30 years ago and went on to kill three young boys who were these
[2:45:24.880 --> 2:45:30.640]  prominent politicians one of the victims who blew the whistle on the abuse handed a list of vip
[2:45:30.640 --> 2:45:37.280]  names to the police the allegations beggar belief young boys driven around london and delivered
[2:45:37.280 --> 2:45:42.880]  to abuse parties mp's police officers and other pillars of the british establishment
[2:45:42.880 --> 2:45:49.280]  engaged in the brave acts of abuse with children and now the latest shocking claim at least three
[2:45:49.280 --> 2:45:55.520]  murders linked to a network of vip perverts an internal home office inquiry last year
[2:45:55.520 --> 2:46:03.200]  discovered 114 files on the issue had gone missing we're talking about the worst kind of crime
[2:46:03.200 --> 2:46:08.480]  committed by the people who are supposed to be running the country why after initially going
[2:46:08.480 --> 2:46:15.200]  public with their belief that the claims were true did police subsequently close the investigation
[2:46:15.200 --> 2:46:22.320]  in 2016 was it for the same reason that police shelved an investigation into the same dolphin
[2:46:22.320 --> 2:46:30.240]  square pedophile cult in 1988 on the orders of those at the top and who was the Tory minister
[2:46:30.240 --> 2:46:38.160]  seen in a child sex abuse video handed to mi5 in 1982 who were the 20 former mp's government
[2:46:38.160 --> 2:46:44.320]  ministers judges and other prominent figures who abused children for decades according to former
[2:46:44.320 --> 2:46:50.080]  child protection manager peter mckelvey there's been extremely powerful elite amongst the highest
[2:46:50.080 --> 2:46:59.280]  levels of the political classes for as long as i've been alive and i'm 65 now and there's been
[2:46:59.280 --> 2:47:05.040]  sufficient reason to investigate it over and over again certainly for the last 30 years
[2:47:05.040 --> 2:47:10.240]  and there's always been the block uh and the cover-up and the collusion to prevent that happening
[2:47:10.240 --> 2:47:17.840]  pedophile mp syril smith abused boys for four decades and was protected by the british establishment
[2:47:17.840 --> 2:47:24.320]  who else are they protecting who protected the pakistani rape gang that was allowed to abuse
[2:47:24.320 --> 2:47:33.280]  and traffic 1400 girls in rotherham for over a decade in 2004 belgian mark dutro was convicted
[2:47:33.280 --> 2:47:39.360]  of kidnapping torturing and sexually abusing six young girls four of whom he murdered i was he able
[2:47:39.360 --> 2:47:43.840]  to kidnap rape and murder young children right under the noses of the police in this modern
[2:47:43.840 --> 2:47:50.320]  european country was he protected why did police visit dutro's home and hear screaming

[2:47:56.080 --> 2:48:01.280]  why were surveillance tapes showing dutro constructing the entrance to the dungeon where
[2:48:01.280 --> 2:48:08.480]  the kidnapped girls were held seized by police but never viewed who were the high level politicians
[2:48:08.480 --> 2:48:14.800]  that dutro named as members of the powerful network he was procuring children for why did
[2:48:14.800 --> 2:48:21.600]  john mark conor the original judge in the case break down in tears before speaking of shadowy
[2:48:21.600 --> 2:48:27.520]  quote figures determined to stop the full truth coming out who were the members of the government

[2:48:58.080 --> 2:49:08.720]  but there were a number of aristocrats that were part of this club who also liked killing children
[2:49:09.280 --> 2:49:15.600]  in 2010 numerous prominent individuals in portugal were convicted for their involvement

[2:56:08.720 --> 2:56:15.120]  hey brother it's good to be back on with you again um real quick am i still on
[2:56:16.080 --> 2:56:21.040]  yes go ahead tell yes okay cool uh you know there's so many moving parts to everything
[2:56:21.040 --> 2:56:25.920]  that's trump trump is going through and i know that you in particular appreciate having complex
[2:56:25.920 --> 2:56:32.240]  things uh just built down into their most basic essence and uh i believe i have the ability to
[2:56:32.240 --> 2:56:37.200]  kind of do that when i analyze all these different things um and uh he can't get his own people in
[2:56:37.200 --> 2:56:40.800]  and they're ignoring him and then they're going to run psyops against him where it looks like if
[2:56:40.800 --> 2:56:44.880]  he doesn't go after syria he's for gassing kids because he thinks the public doesn't understand
[2:56:44.880 --> 2:56:50.080]  false flag attacks what's up to us to educate people go ahead well here's the thing it's like
[2:56:50.080 --> 2:56:54.560]  everything that's going on right now everything's a crisis everything is uh it's epic everything is
[2:56:54.560 --> 2:56:59.040]  huge and i feel like if we're not careful we're going to run the risk of treating everything
[2:56:59.040 --> 2:57:03.600]  like a symptom of the disease rather than treating the disease no but don't you agree we are in an
[2:57:03.600 --> 2:57:08.640]  epic historic time of global shakeup this is one of those times of turmoil i'm not just saying this
[2:57:08.640 --> 2:57:13.680]  but but but sure sure so what's what's the cause not the symptom i mean what's the actual disease
[2:57:15.120 --> 2:57:20.000]  okay all right so here's a quick quote from the movie gladiator i i think totally sums up the entire
[2:57:20.000 --> 2:57:24.720]  thing and and outlines the strategy that trump himself actually needs to take and that it's a
[2:57:24.720 --> 2:57:30.240]  conversation between proxmo and maximus proxmo with his trainer he said i wasn't the best because
[2:57:30.240 --> 2:57:36.880]  i killed quickly i was the best because the crowd loved me win the crowd and you will win your freedom
[2:57:36.880 --> 2:57:42.720]  maximus says i will win the crowd and i will give them something they have never seen before
[2:57:42.720 --> 2:57:47.760]  that to me in my mind perfectly encapsulates where trump needs to put all of his attention
[2:57:47.760 --> 2:57:52.320]  now check this out that's what drudge said he's got to use his charisma out front or be destroyed
[2:57:52.320 --> 2:57:58.320]  go ahead sorry yes but but here's the thing how is he going to do that uh you know i mean uh
[2:57:58.320 --> 2:58:01.680]  right like like we were talking about all these different efforts to take him down
[2:58:01.680 --> 2:58:05.840]  who is easier the the question came to mind who's easier to take down somebody that's that's a very
[2:58:05.840 --> 2:58:11.920]  divisive figure divisive character or somebody who's popular right now trump is that actually at his
[2:58:11.920 --> 2:58:16.640]  weakest point because he's so uh divisive as far as the american public is concerned the
[2:58:16.640 --> 2:58:22.240]  his really his best defense against all manner of attacks from his enemies is to get everybody on
[2:58:22.240 --> 2:58:26.240]  his side and i so far not to criticize trump because i love the guy and i was really sure but
[2:58:26.240 --> 2:58:31.760]  what does he do then how does he get people on his side well he's got to he's got to throw a
[2:58:31.760 --> 2:58:35.760]  bone to the people on the other side and right now he's got to go with the zeitgeist to what i
[2:58:35.760 --> 2:58:42.320]  call the zeitgeist which uh decriminalize marijuana is that what you want 27 thank you for listening
[2:58:42.320 --> 2:58:46.800]  did i guess it visit gcm i don't know what that prompt is today

[3:00:57.440 --> 3:01:03.360]  that trump just drops them just simply ignores them a point is people by executive order we need to

[3:01:08.240 --> 3:01:13.760]  voice and i love your passion no i mean that's it we have to he has to go on the full offense and be
[3:01:13.760 --> 3:01:18.880]  politically incorrect like a bull in a china shop and just annihilate all these people and do fireside
[3:01:18.880 --> 3:01:28.000]  chats every night well the caller hung up making great points uh howard in florida mr howard go

[3:01:35.760 --> 3:01:41.520]  and i think we're looking at this room here in the bible acts chapter one verse eight but each
[3:01:41.520 --> 3:01:48.320]  i receive power that's the rule of harkades the holy spirit then here's the key out in Ephesians
[3:01:48.320 --> 3:01:55.120]  chapter six verse ten finally my brother and be strong in the lord and the power of his might
[3:01:55.120 --> 3:02:00.640]  put on the whole armor of god that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil
[3:02:00.640 --> 3:02:06.080]  when we put on the full armor god the only weapon we have is the sword in spirit which is god's word
[3:02:06.080 --> 3:02:12.080]  we are fighting a spiritual god on 24 seven with satan he needs a body to infiltrate no i totally
[3:02:12.080 --> 3:02:15.920]  agree and i keep trying to beat the new loader i keep trying to be the new loader myself and i
[3:02:15.920 --> 3:02:20.720]  realize i gotta pray pray more that's what takes me out of it when i don't i i get like dark i get
[3:02:20.720 --> 3:02:26.960]  twisted i get i i make mistakes i've got to just trust in god absolutely and torque doesn't have to
[3:02:26.960 --> 3:02:32.880]  blast him the smitherage he has to hit him with the word of god that's the key notice how they
[3:02:32.880 --> 3:02:37.120]  flip out when his wife read the lord's prayer notice how they flip out when he says jesus they
[3:02:37.120 --> 3:02:42.960]  that that just like stuns them for days great because darkness doesn't like to be shined or laid on
[3:02:45.200 --> 3:02:49.200]  expose them how it's with god's word when he's successful he quotes the word of god
[3:02:51.360 --> 3:02:54.560]  absolutely we got to tweak that at him and call him and let him know that absolutely
[3:02:54.560 --> 3:02:58.640]  how are great points god bless you jimmy in south carolina go ahead thanks for holding jimmy
[3:02:58.640 --> 3:03:06.400]  right yeah alex i feel like this uh whole false flag in syria is just to cause division between
[3:03:06.400 --> 3:03:15.360]  us and russia because if in reality why can't trump just uh call a press conference admit we do
[3:03:15.360 --> 3:03:23.520]  have russian ties and it's our common goal to preserve our sovereignty and well i mean i agree
[3:03:23.520 --> 3:03:27.680]  the president's supposed to talk to russia he won't even talk to him now he's so paralyzed over
[3:03:27.680 --> 3:03:32.960]  you know people running as is recused himself because you know shifts running around like i rule
[3:03:32.960 --> 3:03:37.680]  i rule everybody what i say everyone's a russian agent to me you know it's it's like a bunch of
[3:03:37.680 --> 3:03:43.760]  muppets or something it's just crazy you said earlier they want to attack christians because
[3:03:43.760 --> 3:03:49.200]  we have a soft heart well before you attack my children you better look at my callus hands
[3:03:49.760 --> 3:03:54.320]  because i may have a soft heart but when it comes to these children that i raise
[3:03:54.320 --> 3:04:02.400]  my heart has no bearing on what's going to happen and i'll tell you something else if russia and
[3:04:02.400 --> 3:04:10.720]  america stand together and you take these soft ass leaders like north korea and they want to launch
[3:04:10.720 --> 3:04:17.600]  rockets at our allies and you know there's a reason why china's not doing that they've got this joke
[3:04:17.600 --> 3:04:25.440]  soft feminine looking man over there shooting these rockets everywhere there's a reason they've got him
[3:04:25.440 --> 3:04:31.200]  doing it i'm not going to press with that because i don't want to offend too many people but
[3:04:33.120 --> 3:04:39.920]  i just feel like just time maybe we need to help keep us out here and expose the false flag and
[3:04:39.920 --> 3:04:45.600]  then call on russia to stand with us and uh let's go absolutely i think trump should have a press
[3:04:45.600 --> 3:04:49.040]  conference with putin and just sit there and say we're not supposed to work in other countries and
[3:04:49.040 --> 3:04:53.520]  just literally shake his hand that's ridiculous so he needs to get out in front of it instead of
[3:04:53.520 --> 3:04:58.160]  letting the bs be dictated to him all right thank you jimmy i'm going to come introduce this segment
[3:04:58.160 --> 3:05:05.280]  with john rumpford stay with us korey luandowski paul maniforte mike flinn steve bannon and now
[3:05:05.280 --> 3:05:10.560]  devin newness it seems the left's intimidation tactics are actually working newness is the latest
[3:05:10.560 --> 3:05:14.480]  to be asked to step aside after an intense few weeks of grilling from the left as the house
[3:05:14.480 --> 3:05:19.040]  intelligence chairman has now recused himself from the russian probe isn't that too convenient for
[3:05:19.040 --> 3:05:23.040]  the democrats to have the only one involved in this russian probe who actually seems to care
[3:05:23.040 --> 3:05:27.440]  about the truth of the matter step aside and recuse himself just to rub our noses in it
[3:05:27.440 --> 3:05:31.680]  representative adam schiff democrat member of the house intelligence committee made a public
[3:05:31.680 --> 3:05:36.480]  statement moments after newness's announcement saying how pleased he was to hear of newness's
[3:05:36.480 --> 3:05:41.600]  recusal so now the democrats have a monopoly on the political witch hunt that is the russian probe
[3:05:41.600 --> 3:05:46.240]  thanks newness the republicans have gotten their leverage democratically and refuse to use it the
[3:05:46.240 --> 3:05:51.200]  democrats get their leverage with smear campaigns and use it successfully and if we keep allowing
[3:05:51.200 --> 3:05:57.440]  them to do it they're going to continue president trump the swamp is draining us for info wars.com

[3:10:27.600 --> 3:10:31.040]  and all these new iodine supplements are coming out and it's just the biggest rage in the world
[3:10:31.040 --> 3:10:34.720]  and israel comes out and says oh my god we got to give our public iodine and you know we're just

[3:10:50.800 --> 3:10:56.000]  just to meet like-minded people and to trigger the anti-free speech fake leftist it says info
[3:10:56.000 --> 3:11:01.280]  words dot com on the back trump of course is already faltered i expected him to falter more than this
[3:11:01.280 --> 3:11:05.840]  almost 80 days in but uh it was not a lot of faltering until now and now it's it's substantive
[3:11:05.840 --> 3:11:10.720]  it doesn't matter still about promoting the idea of nationalism that's why they'll never rest until
[3:11:10.720 --> 3:11:17.440]  he's destroyed that's why he can't ever capitulate because notice he says okay maybe syria did do this
[3:11:17.440 --> 3:11:21.760]  i mean told this by my joint chiefs this is terrible and they go oh it's your fault syria
[3:11:21.760 --> 3:11:27.120]  and obama cares your fault the singing of the titanic's your fault they want to destroy nationalism
[3:11:27.120 --> 3:11:31.600]  so we'll get john rapaport of no more fake news dot com investigative journalist take
[3:11:32.720 --> 3:11:37.840]  we'll get his take on the state of the world and how he thinks we can arrest the ship because we've
[3:11:37.840 --> 3:11:42.640]  already had huge victories against political correctness globalism is spreading across the world but
[3:11:42.640 --> 3:11:47.680]  the globalists admit they want to stop trump here and they think it'll cause a domino effect the
[3:11:47.680 --> 3:11:52.720]  other way well good luck then of course they're also racing and their power trips their arrogance
[3:11:52.720 --> 3:11:57.920]  their bravada their hootspa start a world war so all that and more right now but ram paul urges trump
[3:11:57.920 --> 3:12:02.240]  not to take military action in syria that's on info words dot com i want to thank all our listeners

[3:12:14.880 --> 3:12:20.080]  dot com because we are all in this together john rapaport take over my friend good to see you thank
[3:12:20.080 --> 3:12:28.880]  you alex good to see you as i wrote uh many months ago and other people have uh joined in on this
[3:12:28.880 --> 3:12:38.720]  this trump has to get out in front as alex was just saying fireside chats every night his own
[3:12:38.720 --> 3:12:49.360]  web channel stream it live talk to the world not just america explain what's happening explain why
[3:12:49.360 --> 3:13:01.280]  he is not going to capitulate explain why there is going to be no us war in syria get that out of
[3:13:01.280 --> 3:13:12.320]  your head mr president get that out of your head now cooperating with russia so what if it's in a
[3:13:12.320 --> 3:13:20.240]  good cause as in this case we know from documents we know from reports we know what happened in
[3:13:20.240 --> 3:13:29.120]  Benghazi we know livia was a staging platform for weapons to go to the syrian rebels meaning
[3:13:29.120 --> 3:13:38.240]  terrorists supported created funded by the us and other allies this is all on the table it's been
[3:13:38.240 --> 3:13:45.840]  on the table for a long time the whole idea here is that the neocons and globalists want a war in
[3:13:45.840 --> 3:13:53.200]  syria that they want endless war they want endless destabilization because it enables them to weaken
[3:13:53.200 --> 3:13:59.680]  populations and take over it's it's pretty simple folks i mean this is not uh you know something
[3:13:59.680 --> 3:14:06.960]  you need a phd and to understand let's say we want to control this population so we need to destroy it
[3:14:06.960 --> 3:14:14.160]  first okay so we have these countries in the middle east african so forth so we have to completely
[3:14:14.160 --> 3:14:25.840]  ruin them we have to cause widespread chaos chaos is our friend that's how these people think
[3:14:26.720 --> 3:14:33.840]  and there's deeper psychological and spiritual reasons of course behind all that but that's
[3:14:33.840 --> 3:14:42.720]  what's going on and if trump is too dim to understand what's happening and realize that he has to get
[3:14:42.720 --> 3:14:49.280]  out in front of all of this and say this is what we're gonna do and this is what we're not going to
[3:14:49.280 --> 3:14:59.520]  do then he is going to go down the tubes he is going to go down the tubes it's one thing to be
[3:14:59.520 --> 3:15:09.920]  isolating and discovering exactly where terrorists are and dealing with that it's another thing to
[3:15:09.920 --> 3:15:19.840]  go back to the old formula of launching wars massive attacks etc etc and taking out the country
[3:15:19.840 --> 3:15:23.840]  that was invaded by the globalists as you just said they're never going to let trump i mean you
[3:15:23.840 --> 3:15:28.720]  agree john just just popping in they're never even letting him capitulate to the globalist
[3:15:28.720 --> 3:15:32.240]  they're going to destroy and they're not going to let him have his agenda of productivity and
[3:15:32.240 --> 3:15:37.440]  freedom that they're going to kill it all yeah they're going to go after him on every possible front
[3:15:38.400 --> 3:15:45.360]  they're going to say basically if you are trump or trump associate or anybody who knows trump
[3:15:45.360 --> 3:15:53.760]  or ever knew trump and you ever talked on the phone to a foreign official that's called collusion
[3:15:53.760 --> 3:16:00.320]  i mean that's how insane they've gotten now in the echo chamber of nsn they're trying to convince
[3:16:00.320 --> 3:16:05.440]  the american public that any conversation that any trump associate ever had with any foreign
[3:16:05.440 --> 3:16:14.160]  leader or official means collusion anti america their minimum that paralyzes the administration
[3:16:14.160 --> 3:16:19.120]  where they can't talk to anybody yeah of course when it's their job to talk to people that's what
[3:16:19.120 --> 3:16:27.600]  they do i remember it must have been almost a year ago now maybe a little less i wrote look trump
[3:16:27.600 --> 3:16:33.920]  just get on the phone with putin just get on the phone or go see him or have him come over here
[3:16:33.920 --> 3:16:40.080]  that's right do it in public demystify a big deal i'm calling yeah tomorrow get on a plane
[3:16:40.800 --> 3:16:46.480]  we don't have to have any diplomatic arrangements and you know all the the hangers on and the people
[3:16:46.480 --> 3:16:51.920]  who don't matter whose jobs are all about deciding which tea they're going to drink because the
[3:16:51.920 --> 3:16:58.720]  american people elected trump he's he's supposed to do this and so i agree trump has got to meet
[3:16:58.720 --> 3:17:05.360]  with putin publicly and demystified and break the will of these disinfo operatives now exactly
[3:17:06.000 --> 3:17:10.640]  sit out there in the rose garden and have a conversation stream it live to the world
[3:17:10.640 --> 3:17:18.320]  sit there and talk for a couple of hours hash it all out what is all this about you know that's key
[3:17:18.320 --> 3:17:25.280]  it should be public public broadcast worldwide over the internet exactly just live talk for an hour
[3:17:25.280 --> 3:17:34.160]  and a half an hour of questions sure absolutely you know putin is going to say you know i don't
[3:17:34.160 --> 3:17:39.280]  even understand what's going on over here in america i mean or which which syrian war are you
[3:17:39.280 --> 3:17:45.600]  thinking about because what we want to do is to stop all that we know these people who claim to be
[3:17:45.600 --> 3:17:53.680]  rebels are actually you know funded by you and by your allies we understand how all this has happened
[3:17:53.680 --> 3:17:59.600]  everybody knows this by now so let's just cut the crap and let's get down to it we don't want a war
[3:17:59.600 --> 3:18:06.000]  in syria you said you don't want a war in syria so let's cooperate and let's stop all of these
[3:18:06.000 --> 3:18:12.320]  neocons who want to destroy countries you know he's going to say something like that so then the
[3:18:12.320 --> 3:18:17.280]  balls in uh trump's court well what about the you know the chemical attacks and so forth well
[3:18:17.280 --> 3:18:25.040]  do you really believe mr president do you really believe that as we were russia and the us moving
[3:18:25.040 --> 3:18:33.840]  toward creating a situation of peace in syria making progress that Assad was going to suddenly
[3:18:33.840 --> 3:18:39.760]  launch a chemical attack so that the whole thing was fall apart i mean that would be destroying
[3:18:39.760 --> 3:18:45.680]  himself that would be self sabotage so we know it was a false flag we know that it was a put up job
[3:18:45.680 --> 3:18:52.720]  we know that your media collaborated in making a story out of this that isn't even the right story
[3:18:52.720 --> 3:18:58.320]  we know all this stuff right you know and then trump has to say something you know and then he
[3:18:58.320 --> 3:19:04.320]  gets on the offensive and he says okay look you know we got a few bones to pick two and here's
[3:19:04.320 --> 3:19:12.080]  what they are hash it all out in the open get it out there just you know ignore all the scum and all
[3:19:12.080 --> 3:19:20.240]  the idiots and all the hangers on and all the diplomats and all the people who get in the way
[3:19:20.240 --> 3:19:26.640]  and say that's what you're doing trump just say that's what you know here's folks i'm just talking
[3:19:26.640 --> 3:19:32.560]  to you now live sitting out here in the rose garden before mr putin shows up because what i've

[3:19:38.080 --> 3:19:43.840]  meet you know in a year or so it's no i decided we got to sit down now this is it and that's what

[3:25:31.440 --> 3:25:36.720]  about the media i'm going to just get rid of a few stories here i was going to talk about because
[3:25:37.520 --> 3:25:46.000]  let's get down to brass tax here 1617 whatever it is now years ago i call this my site no more
[3:25:46.000 --> 3:25:53.040]  fake news dot com because i'd already been working as a reporter since 1982 and it was apparent to me
[3:25:53.040 --> 3:26:02.320]  that we were up against a massive massive force in major media news because they were lying all the
[3:26:02.320 --> 3:26:09.680]  time this was exposed to me when i began doing deep medical investigations and i saw the incredible
[3:26:09.680 --> 3:26:16.400]  criminality medical drugs destroying lives killing people in huge numbers stories going
[3:26:16.400 --> 3:26:22.480]  unreported in the press but it was more than that and it's more than that now so what you're
[3:26:22.480 --> 3:26:31.840]  getting from independent media now is we are going directly around through over major media and we're
[3:26:31.840 --> 3:26:39.600]  presenting you with the stories as they actually are and the reasons why they are and the shakers
[3:26:39.600 --> 3:26:45.280]  and movers behind the scenes the globalists who want to transform the planet into their version
[3:26:45.280 --> 3:26:53.680]  of slavery you're not going to get that on the nightly news with scott paleo cbs or anybody else
[3:26:53.680 --> 3:26:59.040]  in the mainstream because they're covering all that up oh well you see the story is this way
[3:26:59.040 --> 3:27:04.080]  and so she was saying and then he was saying and now we bring on a guest who says this and so it's
[3:27:04.080 --> 3:27:09.600]  very complicated and the two sides are bigger and so forth and this does not look good for the president
[3:27:09.600 --> 3:27:17.040]  and that and you know what do you got you got nothing when you break it apart in your hands
[3:27:17.040 --> 3:27:21.920]  it's like you know some machine-made white bread that just crumbles and you're looking at it and
[3:27:21.920 --> 3:27:30.640]  you're saying i was going to eat that stuff no a direct frontal attack to destroy the credibility
[3:27:30.640 --> 3:27:39.600]  of mainstream news as number one on the agenda because if they're the eyes and ears and mouth
[3:27:39.600 --> 3:27:45.280]  and brain of the public then how's the public ever going to wake up so this war has been going on
[3:27:45.280 --> 3:27:52.720]  for a long time now and it's accelerating and trump can do something about it if he has the
[3:27:52.720 --> 3:28:01.440]  wherewithal if he can get his brain together on the simplicities of what he spoke about in the
[3:28:01.440 --> 3:28:09.120]  campaign ending globalism ending the trade treaties bringing jobs back to america not letting jobs
[3:28:09.120 --> 3:28:20.320]  leave america no foreign wars bring troops home show the people that there is no need to do anything
[3:28:20.320 --> 3:28:27.920]  except defend america that's the point get back to the basics and the simplicities
[3:28:29.200 --> 3:28:33.920]  if there are unlimited numbers of people coming across the border and they're unregulated and
[3:28:33.920 --> 3:28:42.000]  unvetted and they just come through where's the ceiling on that somebody tell me the the upside
[3:28:42.000 --> 3:28:48.320]  number when everybody will agree okay that's all that's it you're never going to get that from
[3:28:48.320 --> 3:28:54.080]  so-called liberal media or liberal politicians well there is no limit because we're kind we're
[3:28:54.080 --> 3:29:00.480]  good we love everybody and so we want to have 50 million 100 million more people just come across
[3:29:00.480 --> 3:29:06.240]  the borders we don't care what condition they're in or who they are or what they want to do here
[3:29:06.240 --> 3:29:10.480]  whether they want to accept america or whether they hate america and they're going to commit
[3:29:10.480 --> 3:29:16.480]  heinous crimes and and how much money it's going to cost no we don't uh you know people let's states
[3:29:16.480 --> 3:29:23.360]  go bankrupt let the federal government go bankrupt on top of already being bankrupt etc etc etc
[3:29:23.360 --> 3:29:32.160]  fine no problem let trump get out in front of all that now with his own web channel and talk about
[3:29:32.160 --> 3:29:39.280]  these basics every day and hammer it home and get past all this echo chamber of the media
[3:29:40.000 --> 3:29:45.600]  that's what he needs to do and he better wake up to that because that's what the people who
[3:29:45.600 --> 3:29:54.880]  elected him want him to do we'll be back we're on the march the empire's on the run alex jones and
[3:29:54.880 --> 3:30:04.880]  the gcn radio network while the swamp is competitive in the political battle it does seem the cultural
[3:30:04.880 --> 3:30:10.560]  swamp is being drained shiola buff's most recent film man down had a blockbuster opening day with
[3:30:10.560 --> 3:30:15.840]  a huge ticket sale yes one ticket since opening night last weekend ticket sales have totaled a
[3:30:15.840 --> 3:30:20.880]  whopping three he's had more flag stolen than ticket sales so shia's childish antics on the
[3:30:20.880 --> 3:30:25.840]  streets earned him more attention than his actual job meanwhile in style magazine had to publish a
[3:30:25.840 --> 3:30:31.840]  story to boost amy schumer's crushed ego headline reading dudes amy schumer is not too vulgar you're
[3:30:31.840 --> 3:30:37.200]  just sexist so now if a man doesn't like a woman it's because he's sexist how dare you not like
[3:30:37.200 --> 3:30:40.960]  my strong proud woman who breaks all the social paradigms by trying to be elegant and abhorrent
[3:30:40.960 --> 3:30:46.480]  at the same time see women can do and be anything yes including too vulgar i ran a series of polls
[3:30:46.480 --> 3:30:52.080]  on twitter called who's the worst and amy schumer won the people have spoken amy schumer is the
[3:30:52.080 --> 3:30:57.120]  worst but if the left wants her to be their poster child go ahead we will keep winning the culture

[3:34:55.600 --> 3:35:03.360]  is happening here with the politicians and with major media and what's been happening for a long
[3:35:03.360 --> 3:35:14.800]  time my experience has always been with these people in the media you take no prisoners you just
[3:35:14.800 --> 3:35:21.040]  don't you don't allow yourself to go on the defensive i'm looking at a story here i'm going
[3:35:21.040 --> 3:35:28.880]  to read a few quotes from it in a minute but that's the idea you don't try to mimic them you don't try
[3:35:28.880 --> 3:35:36.240]  to be the same personality that they are which is basically androids that have a very nasty
[3:35:36.240 --> 3:35:45.440]  underbelly to them i mean these people hate to be unentitled you know it's like the kid who grows up
[3:35:45.440 --> 3:35:49.200]  and the parents are always telling them you're the greatest your special year terrific you're
[3:35:49.200 --> 3:35:53.760]  fantastic here's a trophy for getting out of bed in the morning and here's another trophy
[3:35:53.760 --> 3:36:00.240]  for brushing your teeth and you're just absolutely a genius yes yes and you deserve to have everything
[3:36:00.240 --> 3:36:07.520]  in the world and you're in control of everything that you know you survey yeah yes yes yes and
[3:36:07.520 --> 3:36:14.800]  the guy grows up becomes a nightly news anchor on a major media network hello this is blah blah
[3:36:14.800 --> 3:36:24.000]  blah with the news yes these people hate to be unceded and when you've got the truth when you've
[3:36:24.000 --> 3:36:30.640]  got the facts and you attack them yeah Amy Schumer my parents made me think i was a genius
[3:36:30.640 --> 3:36:38.800]  supermodel isn't that special Amy does anybody care about that
[3:36:38.800 --> 3:36:49.120]  you put these people back on their heels on the defensive you call them out you present the truth
[3:36:49.120 --> 3:36:56.720]  and you are unrelenting about it that's what wins victories that's what wakes people up
[3:36:56.720 --> 3:37:03.520]  and when they wake up they desert mainstream news and they come to you they come to independent media
[3:37:03.520 --> 3:37:12.400]  so we have the case here of Cheryl Atkinson want to spend just a bit of time
[3:37:15.600 --> 3:37:21.200]  want to want to spend a little time on this you might remember she was a CBS star investigative
[3:37:21.200 --> 3:37:30.720]  reporter who was reporting on Benghazi Libya fast and furious the gun walking exercise
[3:37:30.720 --> 3:37:37.920]  is that was completely insane that was being handled under Obama to somehow
[3:37:38.560 --> 3:37:44.800]  chart the actions of Mexican drug cartels and really ended up those weapons have been being in
[3:37:44.800 --> 3:37:51.040]  the hands of cartel members who were killing people and then of course there was the disaster
[3:37:51.040 --> 3:38:05.600]  or the Libya attack the murders in Benghazi and so Atkinson all of a sudden said somebody's bugging
[3:38:05.600 --> 3:38:14.400]  my computer she files a lawsuit against Eric Holder former attorney general against several
[3:38:14.400 --> 3:38:21.600]  federal agencies and that lawsuit is now in progress and I have quotes from court documents
[3:38:22.480 --> 3:38:30.480]  here's how bad it can get when one of the members of the club mainstream news club
[3:38:31.440 --> 3:38:40.720]  goes against the fake news agenda I'm quoting now from court documents in this ongoing lawsuit
[3:38:40.720 --> 3:38:48.640]  let me get to the beginning of that here at the same time that Ms. Atkinson was conducting
[3:38:48.640 --> 3:38:55.280]  investigation and issuing certain of her high-profile news reports the Atkinson's this means at home
[3:38:55.280 --> 3:39:01.040]  began to notice quote began to notice anomalies in numerous electronic devices at their home in
[3:39:01.040 --> 3:39:11.600]  Virginia and quote these included Atkinson's work issued laptop computer and a family desktop
[3:39:11.600 --> 3:39:17.760]  computer quote turning on and off at night without input from anyone in the household and quote
[3:39:18.320 --> 3:39:25.360]  quote the house alarm chirping daily at different times and television programs including problems
[3:39:25.360 --> 3:39:34.160]  including interference all these electronic devices used the Verizon fios line installed
[3:39:34.160 --> 3:39:43.360]  in the Atkinson's home but Verizon was unable to stanch the anomalous activity etc etc in February
[3:39:43.360 --> 3:39:50.800]  2012 sophisticated surveillance spyware was installed on Ms. Atkinson's work issued laptop
[3:39:50.800 --> 3:39:57.760]  computer a later forensic computer analysis revealed that Ms. Atkinson's laptop and family
[3:39:57.760 --> 3:40:05.280]  desktop computer had been the targets of unauthorized surveillance efforts that same analysis revealed
[3:40:05.280 --> 3:40:10.560]  that Ms. Atkinson's mobile phone was also targeted for surveillance when it was connected to the
[3:40:10.560 --> 3:40:17.680]  family's desktop computer you getting all this folks we're talking about serious surveillance here
[3:40:17.680 --> 3:40:24.400]  and harassment not just surveillance harassment because she was obviously aware of this as was
[3:40:24.400 --> 3:40:34.960]  the whole family executed v an IPS IP address owned controls and operated by the United States
[3:40:35.520 --> 3:40:45.360]  postal service get it the infiltration of that computer Atkinson's and the extraction of information
[3:40:45.360 --> 3:40:51.440]  from it was executed v an IP address owned controlled and operated by the United States
[3:40:51.440 --> 3:40:58.400]  postal service additionally based on the sophisticated nature of the software used
[3:40:58.400 --> 3:41:04.240]  to carry out the infiltration and software fingerprints indicating the use of the federal
[3:41:04.240 --> 3:41:12.080]  government's proprietary software the infiltration and surveillance appeared to be perpetrated by
[3:41:12.080 --> 3:41:21.600]  persons in the federal government and it goes on and on from there that's what happens to members
[3:41:21.600 --> 3:41:31.840]  of the club who defect as she did she resigned from CBS News in part because she couldn't get
[3:41:31.840 --> 3:41:41.200]  any justice so she's suing Eric Holder she's suing the head or the former head of the US
[3:41:41.200 --> 3:41:50.080]  postal service she's suing several federal agencies and a judge just issued an order he
[3:41:50.080 --> 3:41:56.240]  could have dismissed the suit but he said you're in the wrong venue I'm going to transfer this
[3:41:56.240 --> 3:42:03.280]  lawsuit to the correct venue in eastern Virginia I'm not going to dismiss it because Ms Atkinson
[3:42:03.280 --> 3:42:10.720]  deserves to have her complaints on the record and her day in court this is a live lawsuit
[3:42:10.720 --> 3:42:20.400]  going on memo to Jeff's sessions new attorney general of the US Jeff open up an investigation
[3:42:20.400 --> 3:42:27.280]  now into what's really happening with a former member of the club Cheryl Atkinson
[3:42:28.160 --> 3:42:34.480]  launch your own investigation into the Atkinson case bring it front and center uncover all the
[3:42:34.480 --> 3:42:43.040]  nasty details and expose the perpetrators you bet why not we're talking about spying these days
[3:42:43.040 --> 3:42:51.280]  right the Susan Rice scandal unmasking the names of Trump associates that were contained in secret
[3:42:51.280 --> 3:42:57.600]  intelligence US intelligence documents and if you start to try to follow the thread of this
[3:42:57.600 --> 3:43:05.200]  insane story it all comes back to the same thing somehow if the Trump transition team or anybody
[3:43:05.200 --> 3:43:12.320]  they knew or anybody those people knew talk to somebody who is a foreign leader they must be
[3:43:12.320 --> 3:43:19.840]  colluding it's got to be some kind of you know treason traitorous treachery you know I mean come
[3:43:19.840 --> 3:43:26.480]  on right so Susan Rice has now been unmasked herself and the question is well how far does US
[3:43:26.480 --> 3:43:33.200]  spying under Obama administration really go and other administrations indeed but we're talking
[3:43:33.200 --> 3:43:39.120]  about Obama now you know the king the prince the prophet well it goes very far obviously this is
[3:43:39.120 --> 3:43:47.120]  just the tip of the iceberg for example the Cheryl Atkinson case right and there's a lot more
[3:43:47.120 --> 3:43:55.200]  and a lot more can come out here a lot more about the government under Obama spying on media
[3:43:55.200 --> 3:44:06.800]  reporters editors politicians remember the case of suddenly senators complaining that the CIA was
[3:44:06.800 --> 3:44:12.400]  spying on them Diane Feinstein was really all wrought up about it exercised about it yeah
[3:44:12.400 --> 3:44:24.800]  you bet forget about that one this spying goes deep deep deep deep Susan Rice case
[3:44:24.800 --> 3:44:33.680]  is just the beginning yeah here's a headline from the Washington Post 2014 Feinstein doesn't like
[3:44:33.680 --> 3:44:42.320]  the CIA spying on her committee but she's fine with NSA bulk data collection yeah really as long
[3:44:42.320 --> 3:44:49.920]  as that bulk data doesn't have anything to do with me or isn't exposed exposing me and all my
[3:44:49.920 --> 3:44:59.200]  peccadillo sure she's fine with that no problem no problem cosmic spying is great but nobody spy on me
[3:45:01.680 --> 3:45:07.840]  and the major media just keep playing along with this agenda playing along with this agenda
[3:45:08.800 --> 3:45:18.080]  that it's all about somehow you know the Obama administration was just clean and pure and wonderful
[3:45:18.080 --> 3:45:27.040]  and the Trump administration after 70 days is Joseph Stalin end of story everything goes into
[3:45:27.040 --> 3:45:34.720]  those two wells just keeps on going here we go here we go here we go here we go yeah
[3:45:36.960 --> 3:45:45.040]  taking down major media news is an ongoing operation it's a conspiracy of the good
[3:45:45.040 --> 3:45:50.720]  the good people the people who want the truth to come out who dig for the truth who present it to
[3:45:50.720 --> 3:45:56.240]  the American people and people all over the world that's what's happening and all of a sudden
[3:45:56.240 --> 3:46:04.240]  now we're hearing what's his name Junker yes mr. Junker John Claude the head of the EU oh
[3:46:04.800 --> 3:46:13.840]  he's going to punish America yes indeed if America continues to support Brexit and is against the
[3:46:13.840 --> 3:46:22.000]  European Union yeah that's fascist superstructure that rules over you know much of Europe unelected
[3:46:22.000 --> 3:46:28.560]  unaccountable yes he's going to come here and he's going to let's see what will he do he's going to
[3:46:28.560 --> 3:46:36.080]  encourage Texas and Ohio to secede from the union yes indeed really John Claude is that what you're
[3:46:36.080 --> 3:46:46.000]  really going to do you think you have a prayer and as I wrote a few days ago come show up we
[3:46:46.000 --> 3:46:54.000]  need you there are too many people in this country versus the government in other words to have a
[3:46:54.000 --> 3:47:01.040]  limited republic you've got to have people closer to the government who have choice indeed we should
[3:47:01.040 --> 3:47:08.080]  have a few states to cede at least a few states no question about it all in fact come help us
[3:47:08.080 --> 3:47:16.560]  John Claude we need your wisdom yes indeed we really do indeed he do we do absolutely
[3:47:20.560 --> 3:47:27.040]  so the major media plays this up as if it's a real threat oh yes my god the head of the European
[3:47:27.040 --> 3:47:33.200]  Union is threatening America we should all tremble indeed yes we should all tremble
[3:47:36.400 --> 3:47:45.680]  Trump has to get out ahead of all of this if he still stands for what he stood for
[3:47:47.600 --> 3:47:56.160]  if he is the person who is going to defeat globalism and make America free and prosperous
[3:47:56.160 --> 3:48:00.080]  and I can I'm sure some people listening well that's ridiculous he never intended to do that
[3:48:00.880 --> 3:48:07.760]  okay whatever but if he is that person there's only one way to handle this situation you become
[3:48:07.760 --> 3:48:15.440]  your own news outlet as many of us have we've been through it Donnie we know what it's like
[3:48:15.440 --> 3:48:25.680]  to build it up from nothing to become your own media outlet because you want freedom as opposed
[3:48:25.680 --> 3:48:34.000]  to brainwashing and mind control from major media news that's what you want right so the
[3:48:34.000 --> 3:48:42.720]  solution as we have learned out here Donnie is you build your own media network now live stream
[3:48:42.720 --> 3:48:53.600]  online bypass all the major media lunatics criminals CIA assets etc etc dispensing lies
[3:48:53.600 --> 3:49:01.360]  falsehoods obfuscations distractions to the American people 24 hours a day you
[3:49:03.840 --> 3:49:11.120]  go past all that and you speak every day to the American people and you remind yourself first
[3:49:11.120 --> 3:49:17.680]  of all of why you're there and why millions of people supported you why millions of people
[3:49:17.680 --> 3:49:25.520]  said well I'm going to hitch my wagon to this horse I don't know who he is exactly but what
[3:49:25.520 --> 3:49:29.840]  he's saying is quite different from anything I've ever heard in a long time from anybody running
[3:49:29.840 --> 3:49:36.720]  for president who managed to get this far let's take a chance let's take a ride let's see what
[3:49:36.720 --> 3:49:45.280]  happens let's go for it the people who did that are the ones who are actually in power not Trump
[3:49:45.280 --> 3:49:53.040]  so you want to talk to those people every day you want to talk to those people every day Mr.
[3:49:53.040 --> 3:50:00.960]  Trump and remind yourself first of all of why you're there on what basis what you're going
[3:50:00.960 --> 3:50:08.320]  to do to make it happen and how you're going to cut away all of the cobwebs and all of the
[3:50:08.320 --> 3:50:16.080]  spiders and all of the red tape in order to communicate directly and get it done directly with
[3:50:16.080 --> 3:50:25.680]  a mandate from the people who want it done and want it done directly and simply and clearly without
[3:50:25.680 --> 3:50:36.800]  any bleeping back and forth and all kinds of insanity okay that's what the people want and
[3:50:36.800 --> 3:50:44.000]  there's only one way to deliver that you've got to talk to the people every day no self-inflating
[3:50:44.000 --> 3:50:51.360]  nonsense straight from the shoulder about the agenda that got you elected that's what you've

[3:54:17.840 --> 3:54:21.760]  my experience with major media news was always
[3:54:21.760 --> 3:54:31.040]  they will take whatever they can get they'll gobble up more territory of the mind of the mind
[3:54:32.160 --> 3:54:38.320]  anytime they can rope it in anytime they can corral it that's what they're going to do
[3:54:39.680 --> 3:54:47.760]  that's what they're there for that's their whole operation they do it by lies they do it by omission
[3:54:47.760 --> 3:54:55.680]  of vital data they do it by providing no context they do it by getting so-called experts on to
[3:54:55.680 --> 3:55:02.880]  tell the lies they want told and to marginalize other experts who would be able to tell a completely
[3:55:02.880 --> 3:55:11.120]  different story and their whole act is to be able to say we cover the waterfront there is
[3:55:11.120 --> 3:55:20.720]  no other news except our news and now they see that the war has changed that situation and in fact
[3:55:21.280 --> 3:55:30.080]  they have no strategy to combat that they have nothing they're firing people because they
[3:55:30.080 --> 3:55:35.360]  can't afford to pay them they're refinancing the financing of the financing of their debt
[3:55:35.360 --> 3:55:43.520]  at like the new york times the whole thing is beginning to come down and to crumble
[3:55:44.720 --> 3:55:51.600]  because people have reached the end of their rope and it's not just people on the right or
[3:55:51.600 --> 3:55:58.880]  people on the left or people in the middle or whatever whatever division you want to concoct
[3:55:58.880 --> 3:56:10.000]  everybody you know everybody has a serious bone to pick with these people because the recognition
[3:56:10.000 --> 3:56:16.240]  is there it's like when you sit down in a restaurant let's say with a couple of friends
[3:56:16.240 --> 3:56:22.480]  and one of the friends brings over somebody and says i'd like you to meet bob and bob sits down
[3:56:22.480 --> 3:56:31.920]  and as soon as bob opens his yap you know he's lying he's a phony he's self-inflating he thinks he
[3:56:31.920 --> 3:56:40.640]  has a certain entitlement that comes from somewhere he's all of that in three seconds and he believes
[3:56:41.200 --> 3:56:48.800]  that he controls the entire territory and whatever he says is the words from above
[3:56:48.800 --> 3:56:55.440]  so you get that immediately now what are you going to do well if it's just five minutes in
[3:56:55.440 --> 3:57:01.920]  restaurant who cares but suppose it's 24 seven on every screen in the world
[3:57:05.200 --> 3:57:11.600]  suppose it's that suppose that's really what it is now you've got to do something
[3:57:11.600 --> 3:57:19.120]  now you've got to do something now you've got to take that down and the best way to take it down
[3:57:19.120 --> 3:57:28.560]  is to expose it and to present the deeper truth that bob is dedicated to obscuring that's the game
[3:57:28.560 --> 3:57:37.600]  folks the game is afoot we are winning we need more of your support we need more people becoming
[3:57:37.600 --> 3:57:45.520]  independent media that's how you get there you wake up one day and you say i am my own media
[3:57:46.320 --> 3:57:55.040]  and i am going to begin broadcasting and transmitting and writing the truth as i find it
[3:57:56.560 --> 3:58:05.600]  that's where it all begins that's called waking up waking up upon waking up that's what that is
[3:58:05.600 --> 3:58:14.880]  that's what that is instead of just percolating in your head what you know put it out put it out
[3:58:14.880 --> 3:58:23.920]  and put it out and put it out become your own media that's what the game is and bob will very
[3:58:23.920 --> 3:58:32.880]  soon find himself out on his butt in the street with nothing because no one wants to hear bob
[3:58:32.880 --> 3:58:39.920]  anymore or listen to what he has to say thank you very much john rapaport on infowars we'll see you
[3:58:39.920 --> 3:59:03.280]  next time this is gcn the genesis communications radio network
