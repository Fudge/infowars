[00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:33.067]  From the Infowars.com News Center, deep behind enemy lines in occupied Texas, broadcasting worldwide, you're listening to the voice of human resistance against the technotronic technocracy takeover.
[00:00:34.472 --> 00:00:40.774]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:00:40.774 --> 00:00:48.236]  Here we are, ladies and gentlemen, broadcasting worldwide, Thursday, the 6th day of April, 2017.
[00:00:48.236 --> 00:00:49.516]  Wow!
[00:00:49.516 --> 00:00:55.978]  We have got a jam-packed broadcast with, what, four or five guests today, I'll tell you about coming up at the start of the next segment.
[00:00:55.978 --> 00:01:02.640]  But, I've seen, what, three or four gas attacks the last four years in Syria, and every time,
[00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:14.323]  It comes out that Al-Nusra, Al-Qaeda, and now ISIS, same group, different names, are the ones behind it.
[00:01:14.323 --> 00:01:22.866]  But then, instantly, we're told these planes fly over, and then a few witnesses in the town say that they dropped nerve gas on them.
[00:01:22.866 --> 00:01:26.927]  But then, we don't ever see any proof.
[00:01:26.927 --> 00:01:30.468]  And as Senator Rand Paul's come out and said he's really cautioning the President,
[00:01:32.023 --> 00:01:42.787]  Not to wade into this quagmire where you've got at least five different factions, four of the five factions, different Wahhabist groups, battling each other for six years trying to take the country over.
[00:01:42.787 --> 00:01:43.627]  It was not a civil war.
[00:01:43.627 --> 00:01:48.609]  It was a globalist financed invasion with Saudi Arabia and now Iran's in the middle of it.
[00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:52.190]  It is a disaster.
[00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.731]  And if we go into there, it is never going to end.
[00:01:56.731 --> 00:01:58.052]  It is just going to be ongoing.
[00:02:00.708 --> 00:02:06.409]  Former Congressman Ron Paul has come out and said the Syrian chemical attack makes no sense and is a false flag.
[00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:10.250]  That's up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.531]  Paul Watson's written an article about it.
[00:02:13.531 --> 00:02:16.432]  Ron Paul, chemical weapons attack in Syria, likely a false flag.
[00:02:16.432 --> 00:02:20.573]  Why is that?
[00:02:20.573 --> 00:02:25.914]  Because we've caught the Wahhabis doing it, at least.
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.862]  Four of the five times it's happened.
[00:02:29.862 --> 00:02:39.034]  Why would, if there's a red line and they're saying, we're going to attack you and invade you and overthrow you if you use chemical weapons, they're not even very useful in warfare of this type.
[00:02:39.034 --> 00:02:41.498]  And then why would Assad do that?
[00:02:41.498 --> 00:02:45.243]  Trump then signals that, well, this is changing my mind on this.
[00:02:46.291 --> 00:02:53.533]  Because his generals, he's got some neocons in there now, tell him, oh, we think it might be from according to what the witnesses said.
[00:02:53.533 --> 00:03:02.355]  And CNN, the folks that told you about babies thrown in incubators and WMDs in Iraq, the same suspects are out there pushing war yet again.
[00:03:02.355 --> 00:03:08.477]  And a lot of people in the Trump cabinet think that if they just go along with the neocon globalist agenda, they're going to leave Trump alone.
[00:03:08.477 --> 00:03:09.978]  They're never going to leave Trump alone.
[00:03:09.978 --> 00:03:10.878]  For the great sin,
[00:03:12.208 --> 00:03:15.930]  of being a nationalist and trying to promote prosperity for the general public.
[00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.450]  They want to destroy Trump.
[00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.152]  And sure enough, they're coming out now saying, too late, Trump!
[00:03:21.152 --> 00:03:26.275]  Even though you say you might want to go in militarily now and actually topple Assad, not Al-Qaeda.
[00:03:26.275 --> 00:03:28.816]  Too late, Trump!
[00:03:28.816 --> 00:03:39.060]  You didn't act in the last 77 days.
[00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.861]  You didn't react.
[00:03:41.175 --> 00:03:55.864]  So now Syria is your fault again when Hillary and Obama and the globalists bragged that they started the entire civil war, which is an al-Qaeda invasion.
[00:03:55.864 --> 00:03:57.064]  That's the facts.
[00:03:57.064 --> 00:03:59.026]  That's what happened.
[00:03:59.026 --> 00:04:02.868]  Drudge has the hydrogen bomb going off on the front page.
[00:04:02.868 --> 00:04:04.429]  Republicans push the button.
[00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.021]  They're going to the nuclear option.
[00:04:07.021 --> 00:04:08.662]  We're going to break that down.
[00:04:08.662 --> 00:04:15.285]  That's just breaking as we speak.
[00:04:15.285 --> 00:04:19.167]  Judge Knapp says unmasking Americans for reasons other than national security is called espionage.
[00:04:19.167 --> 00:04:19.587]  That's right.
[00:04:19.587 --> 00:04:24.710]  Private, corporate, Democratic Party espionage.
[00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.732]  We also have Russia challenging Trump to say what he would do about Syria.
[00:04:28.732 --> 00:04:30.253]  Because they've said remove Assad.
[00:04:30.253 --> 00:04:31.233]  We don't care.
[00:04:31.233 --> 00:04:33.835]  Just let us have our one port in the Mediterranean that we've had.
[00:04:35.814 --> 00:04:44.376]  Let us have access to the Mediterranean, and you can put in a government there, but you have to have a coalition government, and it can't be Wahhabist, because they'll kill everybody.
[00:04:44.376 --> 00:04:46.677]  And Russia's been saying that for four years.
[00:04:46.677 --> 00:04:49.297]  Our military's been saying that.
[00:04:49.297 --> 00:04:57.219]  Our military's been working with the Russians to try to kick al-Qaeda out, but then John McCain a month ago flies over to Syria to stir stuff up.
[00:04:57.219 --> 00:04:58.980]  We even predicted to set up a false flag.
[00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:59.500]  We even said that.
[00:05:01.397 --> 00:05:06.798]  Corey Lewandowski, Paul Manafort, Mike Flynn, Steve Bannon, and now Devin Nunes.
[00:05:06.798 --> 00:05:10.019]  It seems the left's intimidation tactics are actually working.
[00:05:10.019 --> 00:05:18.200]  Nunes is the latest to be asked to step aside after an intense few weeks of grilling from the left, as the House Intelligence Chairman has now recused himself from the Russian probe.
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.321]  Isn't that too convenient for the Democrats?
[00:05:20.321 --> 00:05:26.462]  To have the only one involved in this Russian probe who actually seems to care about the truth of the matter step aside and recuse himself.
[00:05:26.462 --> 00:05:27.642]  Just to rub our noses in it,
[00:05:27.822 --> 00:05:37.666]  Representative Adam Schiff, Democrat member of the House Intelligence Committee, made a public statement moments after Nunes' announcement saying how pleased he was to hear of Nunes' recusal.
[00:05:37.666 --> 00:05:41.988]  So now, the Democrats have a monopoly on the political witch hunt that is the Russian probe.
[00:05:41.988 --> 00:05:42.888]  Thanks, Nunes.
[00:05:42.888 --> 00:05:46.529]  The Republicans have gotten their leverage democratically and refuse to use it.
[00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:50.471]  The Democrats get their leverage with smear campaigns and use it successfully.
[00:05:50.471 --> 00:05:53.452]  And if we keep allowing them to do it, they're going to continue.
[00:05:53.712 --> 00:05:56.421]  President Trump, the swamp is draining us.
[00:05:56.421 --> 00:05:58.809]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.
[00:06:01.434 --> 00:06:03.255]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[00:06:03.255 --> 00:06:09.858]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[00:06:09.858 --> 00:06:13.019]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarslive.com.
[00:06:13.019 --> 00:06:22.803]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single, great-tasting formula.
[00:06:22.803 --> 00:06:23.644]  Caveman.
[00:06:23.644 --> 00:06:28.706]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[00:06:28.706 --> 00:06:30.827]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[00:06:31.127 --> 00:06:34.269]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[00:06:34.269 --> 00:06:39.412]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[00:06:39.412 --> 00:06:47.557]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors, to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[00:06:47.557 --> 00:06:55.502]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[00:06:55.502 --> 00:06:59.024]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself.
[00:06:59.024 --> 00:07:00.165]  EnforceLife.com today.

[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:24.230]  Yes, I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House.
[00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:28.273]  Protesters followed Trump supporters to their cars as they left the convention center.
[00:08:28.273 --> 00:08:33.477]  Around the corner and away from police protection on San Carlos Street, a mob mentality took over.
[00:08:33.477 --> 00:08:34.658]  Who bought a truck?
[00:08:34.658 --> 00:08:36.199]  Who bought a truck?
[00:08:36.199 --> 00:08:36.460]  Yeah!
[00:08:37.506 --> 00:08:41.208]  What do you say to the people who dragged a poor white guy out of a car and beat him?
[00:08:41.208 --> 00:08:43.870]  Oh my goodness, poor white people, please, oh my- stop.
[00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:45.792]  These were pure attacks.
[00:08:45.792 --> 00:08:52.036]  Trump supporters, men, women, even the elderly, left this building last night and walked right into danger.
[00:08:52.036 --> 00:08:59.921]  Police say anti-Trump protesters sprayed five Trump supporters, including an 8 and 11 year old girl outside Anaheim City Hall.
[00:08:59.921 --> 00:09:03.463]  They're throwing things at the guy who has a Trump shirt on.
[00:09:03.463 --> 00:09:06.926]  Oh, he just got knocked in the back of the head, he just got punched in the face.
[00:09:07.828 --> 00:09:10.184]  And now they're rushing him!
[00:09:20.717 --> 00:09:30.403]  We're saying, if you're out there and you're trying to represent your First Amendment right to free speech, if somebody comes and attacks you, it's your right to defend yourself.
[00:09:30.403 --> 00:09:31.544]  It got ugly.
[00:09:31.544 --> 00:09:40.830]  Violence erupting at the event as fights broke out, fists flying between Trump supporters and anti-Trump supporters.
[00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:41.811]  It gets pretty ugly.
[00:09:41.811 --> 00:09:45.654]  Yeah, I want to warn the folks watching at home, you're about to see some very violent footage.
[00:09:52.057 --> 00:10:02.220]  Organizers say today's rallies were meant as a show of unity against what they call a seditious fringe, allegedly trying to sabotage the president.
[00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:07.201]  You can see there a FedEx delivery driver jumping in to try to put an end to the protest.
[00:10:07.201 --> 00:10:07.861]  You know what?
[00:10:07.861 --> 00:10:08.361]  You know what?
[00:10:08.361 --> 00:10:09.222]  Get the f**k out!
[00:10:09.222 --> 00:10:11.402]  Just to strike the numbers, I'll give it to you.
[00:10:11.402 --> 00:10:14.963]  If you want to come out, you better be up a hundred of you against one of me, because that's what it's going to take.
[00:10:18.366 --> 00:10:22.269]  People like myself will stand up and we'll be coming right back at you.
[00:10:22.269 --> 00:10:24.811]  You say he's not your president, then you shouldn't be here!
[00:10:24.811 --> 00:10:28.694]  Donald Trump is bringing us together!
[00:10:28.694 --> 00:10:29.874]  You got that?
[00:10:29.874 --> 00:10:32.837]  This is the heart of 1776.
[00:10:32.837 --> 00:10:34.998]  And this is the Live Global Thursday.
[00:10:34.998 --> 00:10:37.300]  You think he's better than us?
[00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:39.662]  Edition of the transmission.
[00:10:39.662 --> 00:10:40.403]  Thank you so much.
[00:10:40.403 --> 00:10:41.964]  It is already the sixth day.
[00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:46.032]  Hard to believe.
[00:10:46.032 --> 00:10:46.412]  Of April 2017.
[00:10:46.412 --> 00:10:47.894]  Again, I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:10:47.894 --> 00:10:48.354]  We have a
[00:10:55.083 --> 00:10:58.304]  A lot of informative guests to say the least today.
[00:10:58.304 --> 00:11:06.287]  And we have Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, hadn't been on in a while, to break down the geopolitical and military developments in the South China Sea and the Korean Peninsula.
[00:11:06.287 --> 00:11:16.670]  We have Michael Schneider on huge breakdowns on the chain reactions of military action taking place in Syria, but again also in the South China Sea and how that ties together.
[00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:21.312]  All these different flare-ups happening at the same time, just like we witnessed before other major wars start.
[00:11:22.012 --> 00:11:39.244]  Millie Weaver from on the ground in California investigating with law enforcement and certified orphanages and other institutions of all the verified child trafficking, child kidnapping, satanism, all of it.
[00:11:39.244 --> 00:11:39.625]  They're there.
[00:11:41.147 --> 00:11:42.548]  Really doing an in-depth investigation.
[00:11:42.548 --> 00:11:53.637]  They're going to bring back an HD video for everybody, for the TV viewers and for the radio audience to really document what's going on now that MSM is denying that pedophilia even exists in between Salon Magazine promoting it.
[00:11:53.637 --> 00:11:54.317]  It's a wonderful thing.
[00:11:54.317 --> 00:12:04.105]  And then we're also going to have John Rappaport on the transmission hosting the fourth hour as he does every two weeks doing a great job.
[00:12:04.105 --> 00:12:04.385]  All right.
[00:12:07.639 --> 00:12:09.800]  Here's the different quadrants of news.
[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:14.463]  We have the big chemical weapon attack in Syria.
[00:12:14.463 --> 00:12:20.047]  And you have Ron Paul saying he believes it's a false flag.
[00:12:20.047 --> 00:12:21.848]  I remember the days when Ron Paul
[00:12:25.919 --> 00:12:29.681]  Would not talk about false flags, but it's a great thing to see now.
[00:12:29.681 --> 00:12:32.723]  This is so mainstream that Ron Paul's come out.
[00:12:32.723 --> 00:12:39.687]  His son has come out and said, the senator, that he's urging Trump not to take military action in Syria.
[00:12:39.687 --> 00:12:41.508]  I don't want to support people who hate our country.
[00:12:41.508 --> 00:12:45.671]  Yeah, we're going to go take Assad out, who never attacked us, and put Al Qaeda in.
[00:12:45.671 --> 00:12:49.453]  That's what this means.
[00:12:49.453 --> 00:12:54.316]  Why would Assad, if he was told, you use chemical weapons, four years ago we will invade you.
[00:12:55.643 --> 00:12:57.885]  And we will bombard Damascus with a full U.S.
[00:12:57.885 --> 00:12:59.586]  Air Force.
[00:12:59.586 --> 00:13:00.586]  Along with NATO.
[00:13:00.586 --> 00:13:05.069]  We'll fire cruise missiles by the thousands at you.
[00:13:05.069 --> 00:13:11.494]  Why would they then have planes fly over a village and then bomb it?
[00:13:11.494 --> 00:13:13.855]  Damascus says they bombed an Al-Qaeda, ISIS...
[00:13:14.881 --> 00:13:21.723]  chemical plant, and Al-Qaeda and ISIS have hundreds of videos online, and you can go search into them.
[00:13:21.723 --> 00:13:27.605]  They put them up as fast as you can take them down, of them nerve-gassing dogs, people, testing it.
[00:13:27.605 --> 00:13:28.265]  They were caught.
[00:13:28.265 --> 00:13:41.689]  The UN even came out three years ago and said, no, on the one-year anniversary of the Red Line declaration by Obama, it was al-Nusra launching the mortars to blame Assad.
[00:13:43.558 --> 00:13:54.382]  But we get these reports, and the Joint Chiefs tell Trump that we believe this is Assad doing this, and now we know.
[00:13:54.382 --> 00:13:57.523]  This is what we speculated yesterday.
[00:13:57.523 --> 00:14:12.248]  This is what our expert guest, Joel Skousen, speculated yesterday, that Bannon probably was out of national security, still Chief Advisor, because he would not go along with the new neocon generals that are in there who want war, and who are going along with John McCain's agenda.
[00:14:13.598 --> 00:14:18.120]  And now the report's out, Kit Daniels breaks it down with links to mainstream news.
[00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:30.685]  Ban and removal, a whipped up controversy by mainstream media, but then it goes further to break down that he was clashing with the generals and did not want to go along with this Syria situation, this huge quagmire.
[00:14:30.685 --> 00:14:32.906]  And that's what General Flynn had advised them on.
[00:14:32.906 --> 00:14:37.648]  He ran those operations, not backing Al Qaeda and ISIS, starting five years ago.
[00:14:38.973 --> 00:14:40.694]  And our military stood up and said no to that.
[00:14:40.694 --> 00:14:43.076]  Remember we're not going to be Al Qaeda's air force?
[00:14:43.076 --> 00:14:47.838]  Remember Senator Rand Paul and others and Senator Cruz making those statements?
[00:14:47.838 --> 00:14:51.441]  Because that's what's happening here.
[00:14:51.441 --> 00:14:56.684]  That's what's happening here.
[00:14:56.684 --> 00:15:01.407]  Bannon threatened to resign completely over clashes with McMaster, Kushner, and Ivanka.
[00:15:04.815 --> 00:15:11.838]  And he's the only guy that was up there that is a real Americana and has a battle plan to save the country, and Trump has been adopting it.
[00:15:11.838 --> 00:15:13.939]  That's why he's public enemy number one, Stephen Bannon.
[00:15:13.939 --> 00:15:17.181]  And I'm not against Kushner and Ivanka and all these other people.
[00:15:17.181 --> 00:15:25.485]  They just are from New York City with a lot of rich liberals around them, and they admit they're big Democrats, and they just can't seem to get it.
[00:15:25.485 --> 00:15:28.706]  Trump has been basically a John Berger forever.
[00:15:28.706 --> 00:15:33.749]  Sat at the knee of, you know, the head lawyer from the Un-American Activities Committee.
[00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:35.911]  Roy Cohn.
[00:15:35.911 --> 00:15:43.474]  And if you actually go back to the New York Times articles from 30 years ago, where they interviewed Trump, he was like a super nationalistic, uber right-winger.
[00:15:43.474 --> 00:15:47.336]  But he played along with the liberals and stuff for business.
[00:15:47.336 --> 00:15:54.239]  And that's why they hate his guts, because you see his action, turning the jobs on, securing the borders, all these good things.
[00:15:54.239 --> 00:15:59.802]  He has to understand, though, if he plays along with the neocons, they'll hang this failed war in a couple years around his neck.
[00:16:00.748 --> 00:16:04.649]  And by the way, they're already in the news saying, oh, too little, too late.
[00:16:04.649 --> 00:16:07.849]  Syria's your fault now.
[00:16:07.849 --> 00:16:13.971]  Even though Obama and Hillary and all of them started the Arab Spring with Saudi Arabia, ran the whole deal, Google, social media backed it.
[00:16:13.971 --> 00:16:15.391]  They did this six years ago.
[00:16:15.391 --> 00:16:17.711]  They kicked it off in Tunisia and then Libya.
[00:16:17.711 --> 00:16:20.072]  They went and made all those states become failed states.
[00:16:20.072 --> 00:16:23.613]  They did it on purpose.
[00:16:23.613 --> 00:16:28.254]  Islamic State of Al-Qaeda, that's what it is, is spread all over the world now.
[00:16:28.254 --> 00:16:29.574]  From less than two countries, over 30.
[00:16:32.034 --> 00:16:33.395]  In six years.
[00:16:33.395 --> 00:16:47.260]  This is a major Islamic offensive, and Ergun is directing it, and directing the Muslims going into Europe, almost all of them Wahhabists, Sunnis, saying, we're invading, we're taking over Europe, we're dictating to you, we're controlling you.
[00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:52.142]  You will do what we say or we'll have a holy war and burn your capitals down.
[00:16:52.142 --> 00:16:54.463]  The globalists are allied with Islam.
[00:16:54.463 --> 00:16:56.183]  And notice, Turkey isn't non-radical now.
[00:16:56.183 --> 00:16:59.865]  As soon as they got their numbers up, oh yeah, we're radical, oh yeah, we hail the Wahhabists.
[00:17:01.735 --> 00:17:05.457]  Take out the evil European Nazis, he says, even though it's the Muslims who work for the Nazis.
[00:17:05.457 --> 00:17:07.078]  So, that's what's going on.
[00:17:07.078 --> 00:17:16.224]  It's the EU globalists, it's the Islamists, it's Communist China, it's the big mega-banks, all against America, all against the UK, all against Japan, all against South Korea.
[00:17:18.294 --> 00:17:24.101]  And they're just running around in everybody's face, bullying as hardcore as they can.
[00:17:24.101 --> 00:17:24.501]  There it is.
[00:17:24.501 --> 00:17:26.324]  Holy Wars will soon begin in Europe.
[00:17:26.324 --> 00:17:28.846]  Turkey Foreign Minister issues grave warning to EU.
[00:17:28.846 --> 00:17:29.868]  Let more Muslims in.
[00:17:29.868 --> 00:17:32.351]  Give us billions of dollars or we'll burn your cities down.
[00:17:34.448 --> 00:17:37.168]  And then they start rioting, because the Europeans have been gelded.
[00:17:37.168 --> 00:17:38.869]  They've been trained to lay down and roll over.
[00:17:38.869 --> 00:17:50.371]  You bring in a giant, hardcore, third-world population that's used to all this milling around and killing and killing each other, and they're waving their flags in your country, and they're saying, we're taking over, you get ready.
[00:17:50.371 --> 00:17:54.652]  And Steve Bannon recognizes that and says, Islam is the main threat.
[00:17:54.652 --> 00:17:55.772]  Ideologically, you name it.
[00:17:55.772 --> 00:17:57.372]  Communist China is the next threat.
[00:17:57.372 --> 00:17:59.212]  Militarily, the number one threat.
[00:17:59.212 --> 00:18:00.133]  Not the Russians!
[00:18:00.133 --> 00:18:01.713]  The Russians are battling Islam.
[00:18:03.831 --> 00:18:05.733]  They just got bombed on Monday in St.
[00:18:05.733 --> 00:18:07.274]  Petersburg.
[00:18:07.274 --> 00:18:12.939]  So, horrifying photos of these little children, so dear, hit with nerve gas.
[00:18:12.939 --> 00:18:21.867]  You can pull up all the articles going back four years ago where they continually got caught launching these in close quarters inside cities.
[00:18:21.867 --> 00:18:24.769]  And then the news, CNN announcing that Assad did it.
[00:18:24.769 --> 00:18:26.351]  Assad said, we would do no such thing.
[00:18:26.351 --> 00:18:27.692]  We gave up our chemical weapons.
[00:18:27.992 --> 00:18:29.593]  Three years ago under a deal, remember?
[00:18:29.593 --> 00:18:32.314]  The Russians came and transferred them out with inspectors.
[00:18:32.314 --> 00:18:33.754]  But we wouldn't do that anyways.
[00:18:33.754 --> 00:18:36.015]  It's not even militarily useful.
[00:18:36.015 --> 00:18:42.937]  All it does is just overthrow us!
[00:18:42.937 --> 00:18:46.459]  But Trump's being told, do this, and they'll stop saying you're a Russian.
[00:18:46.459 --> 00:18:46.939]  Do this.
[00:18:46.939 --> 00:18:48.339]  They're never going to stop.
[00:18:48.339 --> 00:18:49.260]  They're the globalists.
[00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:50.280]  They're the threat to America.
[00:18:51.613 --> 00:18:56.538]  They're never going to stop these committee hearings and all this made-up crud when they're the ones with the connections to the Russians.
[00:18:56.538 --> 00:19:00.021]  They're never going to stop all their calls for violence to kill Trump and his family.
[00:19:00.021 --> 00:19:05.747]  And then if we say anything back, oh my God, we're the devil, we need to be arrested, even if it's tongue-in-cheek.
[00:19:07.398 --> 00:19:10.679]  We're going to continue to pound the globalists in the info war.
[00:19:10.679 --> 00:19:11.859]  Violence is not the answer.
[00:19:11.859 --> 00:19:13.219]  We're winning intellectually.
[00:19:13.219 --> 00:19:15.959]  As I've always said, offensive violence is never the answer.
[00:19:15.959 --> 00:19:18.400]  We need to information warfare with the truth, though.
[00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:19.560]  Pound these lies.
[00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:25.781]  But CNN has a long history of war propaganda about made-up WMDs, about throwing babies out of incubators in Kuwait.
[00:19:25.781 --> 00:19:27.061]  It's all come out.
[00:19:27.061 --> 00:19:28.962]  But look at this poor little baby.
[00:19:28.962 --> 00:19:29.862]  You know, I have children.
[00:19:29.862 --> 00:19:32.282]  This hurts my heart.
[00:19:32.282 --> 00:19:35.283]  Ron Paul, chemical weapons attack in Syria, likely a false flag.
[00:19:35.283 --> 00:19:36.483]  We're going to play the clip when we come back.
[00:19:37.475 --> 00:19:42.837]  United Nations to hold emergency meeting after suspected chemical attack in Syria.
[00:19:42.837 --> 00:19:45.578]  We are compelled to take our own action if U.N.
[00:19:45.578 --> 00:19:46.578]  fails in Syria.
[00:19:46.578 --> 00:19:46.958]  U.S.
[00:19:46.958 --> 00:19:49.139]  Envoy.

[00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:56.341]  It's unbelievable.
[00:19:56.341 --> 00:19:57.781]  It's unbelievable.
[00:19:57.781 --> 00:19:59.882]  And of course, this will push us into war with Russia.
[00:20:01.195 --> 00:20:04.896]  Is your child's school not lining up with your family values?

[00:20:32.083 --> 00:20:36.845]  Barack Obama's most loyal aides still hold office and they want to stop President Trump.
[00:20:36.845 --> 00:20:40.926]  Deep State was first revealed in the runaway New York Times bestseller Big Agenda.
[00:20:40.926 --> 00:20:46.548]  David Horowitz's Big Agenda exposes Obama's government in exile and his shocking plan.

[00:22:02.450 --> 00:22:07.493]  That one small company doesn't stand a chance against the corporate behemoths with all their money and lawyers.
[00:22:07.493 --> 00:22:09.494]  But they don't know Harry's.

[00:23:00.601 --> 00:23:13.109]  Your community's aging water infrastructure systems are very likely to be contaminated with heavy metals like lead, disinfection chemicals like ammonia, chlorine, and chloramines, and pharmaceuticals like statins, pain meds, and antidepressants.
[00:23:13.109 --> 00:23:17.352]  And no, water treatment plants are not equipped to filter these pharmaceutical toxins out.

[00:24:04.344 --> 00:24:06.526]  Welcome back!
[00:24:06.526 --> 00:24:11.169]  President Trump meets today with a Chinese dictator they call a president.
[00:24:11.169 --> 00:24:14.531]  But I'm not supposed to say that, that's politically incorrect.
[00:24:14.531 --> 00:24:17.474]  That's right, don't criticize dictators.
[00:24:17.474 --> 00:24:20.516]  And on top of that, we've got a war brewing!
[00:24:22.555 --> 00:24:34.800]  If Russia doesn't back down and leave Syria, if the United States decides to take out Assad, who didn't start the war, who got invaded by Al-Qaeda forces.
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:43.004]  And our own Pentagon has testified to Congress, I knew about this back when it was classified from our sources, but it came out years later that 95% of the forces are radical Sunni-based.
[00:24:46.423 --> 00:24:49.965]  And Syrian girl, her family was part of the ruling party before that.
[00:24:49.965 --> 00:24:51.245]  They don't even like Assad.
[00:24:51.245 --> 00:24:53.947]  They got kicked out by Assad's dad.
[00:24:53.947 --> 00:24:55.047]  She's in Australia.
[00:24:55.047 --> 00:24:56.208]  She's very learned and smart.
[00:24:56.208 --> 00:24:58.509]  She's been on national TV in Australia and other places.
[00:24:58.509 --> 00:24:59.990]  She's been on here many times.
[00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:05.973]  She goes by Syrian girl, but she's written this article on her full name on Infowars.com about the chemical attack, saying it's clearly a false flag.
[00:25:05.973 --> 00:25:09.474]  First, we broke that yesterday.
[00:25:09.474 --> 00:25:14.757]  And she talks about the fact that, no, I mean, it is Sunni.
[00:25:16.351 --> 00:25:22.776]  And now with Saudi Arabia getting control of Sunni Islam, it's just completely radicalized now and completely murderous.
[00:25:22.776 --> 00:25:26.039]  And she'll tell you what the military says is true.
[00:25:26.039 --> 00:25:29.662]  90 plus percent are radical Sunnis.
[00:25:29.662 --> 00:25:33.965]  And they're not going to let Alawites, Shiites, Christians live in peace, folks.
[00:25:33.965 --> 00:25:34.846]  They're going to kill everybody.
[00:25:34.846 --> 00:25:37.007]  And they're going to make women wear hoods over their heads.
[00:25:37.007 --> 00:25:38.709]  And that's who we're going to back?
[00:25:39.636 --> 00:25:40.596]  You can't do that.
[00:25:40.596 --> 00:25:44.177]  There is not a good, moderate opposition group.
[00:25:44.177 --> 00:25:47.098]  That's why Russia keeps saying, what are you going to do?
[00:25:47.098 --> 00:25:50.279]  Kick ISIS out, then Assad will leave.
[00:25:50.279 --> 00:25:57.000]  Stabilize the country, and then we, who are in control of the country, have made deals with Assad that will create a new coalition government.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:57.881]  Globalists don't want that.
[00:25:57.881 --> 00:25:58.801]  They want another failed state.
[00:26:00.854 --> 00:26:08.660]  That's why the Pentagon actually has people in it that cared, like General Flynn and others, and General Dempsey, who said, we're not going to be part of this.
[00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:17.547]  We're not going to put the most radical Muslims in control of one of the oldest Christian countries in the world previously.
[00:26:17.547 --> 00:26:21.851]  Because so much of the population are crypto-Christians, secret Christians.
[00:26:21.851 --> 00:26:25.374]  Let's go to Dr. Ron Paul on his television program talking about this.
[00:26:26.411 --> 00:26:29.653]  Things were going along reasonably well for the conditions.
[00:26:29.653 --> 00:26:35.958]  You know, Trump says let the Syrians decide who should run their country.
[00:26:35.958 --> 00:26:39.060]  And peace talks were breaking out.
[00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:45.904]  And Al-Qaeda and ISIS were on the run, maybe defeated.
[00:26:45.904 --> 00:26:48.806]  So it was like, you know, in spite of their
[00:26:50.147 --> 00:26:50.608]  I think so.
[00:27:15.928 --> 00:27:23.076]  I looked at the New York Times to find out, to get the explanation, and they said, worst chemical attack in years in Syria.
[00:27:23.076 --> 00:27:23.496]  U.S.
[00:27:23.496 --> 00:27:24.577]  blames Assad.
[00:27:24.577 --> 00:27:26.799]  So, it's all over and done with.
[00:27:26.799 --> 00:27:28.601]  But not quite so easy, is it?
[00:27:28.601 --> 00:27:33.166]  What happened four years ago in 2013?
[00:27:33.166 --> 00:27:37.510]  You know, this whole thing about crossing the red line, and ever since then,
[00:27:38.491 --> 00:27:40.433]  The neocons have been yelling and screaming.
[00:27:40.433 --> 00:27:48.138]  Even part of the administration is still yelling and screaming about Assad using poison gases on his people four years ago.
[00:27:48.138 --> 00:27:49.179]  Not quite true.
[00:27:49.179 --> 00:27:51.420]  Yeah, it was never proven, in fact.
[00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:57.925]  And the UN official Carla Del Ponte said that attack was most likely done by the rebels, based on the evidence.
[00:27:57.925 --> 00:28:00.507]  But here you have Nikki Haley, US ambassador to the UN.
[00:28:01.267 --> 00:28:07.750]  Almost as we speak, literally, at the UN Security Council, saying, quote, we know Assad has used chemical weapons before.
[00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:08.351]  That's not true.
[00:28:08.351 --> 00:28:09.731]  It has never been proven that he has.
[00:28:09.731 --> 00:28:10.552]  He may have.
[00:28:10.552 --> 00:28:11.912]  We do know that the rebels have used them.
[00:28:11.912 --> 00:28:13.613]  That has been proven.
[00:28:13.613 --> 00:28:15.434]  And who would benefit?
[00:28:15.434 --> 00:28:22.518]  It makes no sense, even if you were totally separate from this and take no size of this, and you were just an analyst.
[00:28:23.058 --> 00:28:28.579]  It doesn't make any sense for Saud in these conditions to all of a sudden use poison gases.
[00:28:28.579 --> 00:28:34.781]  I think it's zero chance that he would have done this, you know, deliberately.
[00:28:34.781 --> 00:28:37.522]  You know why they want to shut down the free internet?
[00:28:37.522 --> 00:28:39.942]  How are they going to compete with a show like that?
[00:28:39.942 --> 00:28:41.402]  Or this one?
[00:28:41.402 --> 00:28:45.884]  Where we have memories and we show you articles and the UN admitting it and everything.
[00:28:45.884 --> 00:28:49.224]  In fact, the UN specifically tested the chemicals, so did other governments.
[00:28:49.224 --> 00:28:51.625]  That's when the British pulled out and had a vote and said, we're not doing this.
[00:28:53.419 --> 00:29:10.914]  Saudi Arabia was connected to a nerve gas attack using mortars, and then they were, their Wahhabis wanted to be rock stars though, so they videotaped themselves launching the chemical attacks, gibbering about it, and uploaded it the same day.
[00:29:10.914 --> 00:29:17.840]  While our media was blaming Assad, he's going, why would I use chemical weapons on a populated area and turn the whole population against myself?
[00:29:19.693 --> 00:29:22.996]  And you say if I use chemical weapons, you're going to hit me out of the clear blue sky.
[00:29:22.996 --> 00:29:25.818]  I've never threatened to use chemicals, would never use chemicals.
[00:29:25.818 --> 00:29:27.720]  All of a sudden you're like, if you use chemicals, we're going to invade.
[00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:29.721]  You're like, okay, well, I'm not going to.
[00:29:29.721 --> 00:29:31.363]  Oh my gosh, chemicals!
[00:29:31.363 --> 00:29:34.245]  On the one year anniversary of Obama's red line.
[00:29:34.245 --> 00:29:35.666]  I mean, how transparent.
[00:29:35.666 --> 00:29:38.829]  And then they get caught doing it a whole bunch of times.
[00:29:40.214 --> 00:29:41.295]  I said four or five times.
[00:29:41.295 --> 00:29:41.695]  I was looking.
[00:29:41.695 --> 00:29:47.299]  It's more than 11 times they've been caught using chemical weapons on video and bragging about it.
[00:29:47.299 --> 00:29:48.420]  And then they blame Assad.
[00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:50.701]  I mean, it's just... And now they want war with Russia.
[00:29:50.701 --> 00:29:54.344]  Oh my gosh.
[00:29:54.344 --> 00:29:57.046]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.536 --> 00:30:06.641]  While the swamp is competitive in the political battle, it does seem the cultural swamp is being drained.
[00:30:06.641 --> 00:30:12.167]  Shia LaBeouf's most recent film, Man Down, had a blockbuster opening day with a huge ticket sale.
[00:30:12.167 --> 00:30:13.488]  Yes, one ticket.
[00:30:13.488 --> 00:30:17.292]  Since opening night last weekend, ticket sales have totaled a whopping three.
[00:30:17.292 --> 00:30:19.334]  He's had more flags stolen than ticket sales.
[00:30:19.594 --> 00:30:24.057]  So Shia's childish antics on the streets earned him more attention than his actual job.
[00:30:24.057 --> 00:30:28.761]  Meanwhile, InStyle Magazine had to publish a story to boost Amy Schumer's crushed ego.
[00:30:28.761 --> 00:30:33.004]  Headline reading, So now, if a man doesn't like a woman, it's because he's sexist.
[00:30:36.727 --> 00:30:42.151]  How dare you not like my strong, proud woman who breaks all the social paradigms by trying to be elegant and abhorrent at the same time.
[00:30:42.151 --> 00:30:42.431]  See?
[00:30:42.431 --> 00:30:44.132]  Women can do and be anything.
[00:30:44.132 --> 00:30:45.733]  Yes, including too vulgar.
[00:30:45.733 --> 00:30:50.356]  I ran a series of polls on Twitter called Who's the Worst, and Amy Schumer won.
[00:30:50.356 --> 00:30:51.637]  The people have spoken.
[00:30:51.637 --> 00:30:53.018]  Amy Schumer is the worst.
[00:30:53.018 --> 00:30:56.160]  But if the left wants her to be their poster child, go ahead.
[00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:57.961]  We will keep winning the culture war.
[00:30:57.961 --> 00:31:00.303]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroyer.
[00:31:01.263 --> 00:31:03.165]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[00:31:03.165 --> 00:31:05.187]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[00:31:05.187 --> 00:31:08.090]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[00:31:08.090 --> 00:31:14.156]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[00:31:14.156 --> 00:31:21.524]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed
[00:31:21.664 --> 00:31:23.325]  Alexa Pure Breeze.
[00:31:23.325 --> 00:31:30.868]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children, to do the best job you can to purify your air.
[00:31:30.868 --> 00:31:38.892]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[00:31:38.892 --> 00:31:39.853]  The general public doesn't.
[00:31:41.068 --> 00:31:44.452]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[00:31:44.452 --> 00:31:48.596]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[00:31:48.596 --> 00:31:55.303]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[00:31:55.303 --> 00:31:59.407]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:32:01.758 --> 00:32:03.599]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[00:32:03.599 --> 00:32:10.202]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[00:32:10.202 --> 00:32:13.343]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarslive.com.
[00:32:13.343 --> 00:32:23.127]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single, great-tasting formula.
[00:32:23.127 --> 00:32:23.988]  Caveman.
[00:32:23.988 --> 00:32:29.050]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[00:32:29.050 --> 00:32:31.151]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[00:32:31.451 --> 00:32:34.614]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[00:32:34.614 --> 00:32:39.758]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[00:32:39.758 --> 00:32:47.904]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[00:32:47.904 --> 00:32:55.850]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[00:32:55.850 --> 00:33:00.494]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself and fullwarslime.com today.
[00:33:15.507 --> 00:33:22.260]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:24.484]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:24.484 --> 00:33:25.687]  False flag in Syria!
[00:33:28.784 --> 00:33:30.605]  And who would benefit?
[00:33:30.605 --> 00:33:38.230]  It makes no sense, even if you were totally separate from this, and take no signs of this, and you were just an analyst.
[00:33:38.230 --> 00:33:43.754]  It doesn't make any sense for Sodom, these conditions, to all of a sudden use poison gases.
[00:33:43.754 --> 00:33:49.918]  I think it's zero chance that he would have done this, you know, deliberately.
[00:33:51.055 --> 00:33:52.816]  And he goes on to say it looks like a false flag.
[00:33:52.816 --> 00:33:54.117]  It's on Infowars.com.
[00:33:54.117 --> 00:33:56.138]  Ron Paul, chemical weapons attack in Syria.
[00:33:56.138 --> 00:33:57.599]  Likely a false flag.
[00:33:57.599 --> 00:34:07.084]  Of course, former Marine Corps officer and fighter-bomber pilot Joel Skousen came on the broadcast and said, look, clearly false flag.
[00:34:07.084 --> 00:34:09.185]  They've been caught doing it many other times.
[00:34:09.185 --> 00:34:12.027]  And Ron Paul and others go over all that.
[00:34:12.027 --> 00:34:13.668]  We've been breaking this since day one.
[00:34:15.674 --> 00:34:19.956]  But now, see, they're telling Trump, no, we know it's them with no proof.
[00:34:19.956 --> 00:34:28.461]  CNN says so, the brass tell him, and so we've got to go in.
[00:34:28.461 --> 00:34:35.005]  And Haley's running around saber-rattling with Russia and everybody else, and then she gets booed because she's not pro-war enough.
[00:34:35.005 --> 00:34:36.446]  That's the new liberal thing.
[00:34:38.746 --> 00:34:50.413]  Because the Democrats are the anti-Russians, and the Democrats are the anti-communists, and the Democrats are the anti-radical Muslims, and the radical Muslims are Assad because he isn't the radical Muslim.
[00:34:50.413 --> 00:34:54.895]  And the EU's allied with Turkey, overrunning Europe, and openly admitting they're doing it now.
[00:34:54.895 --> 00:34:57.877]  We were talking about Turkey getting ready to muscle in a few years ago.
[00:34:57.877 --> 00:34:59.338]  They just say it now.
[00:35:01.104 --> 00:35:04.085]  Wow, this is an incredible time to be alive, I'm here to tell you.
[00:35:04.085 --> 00:35:12.029]  And that's why Bannon's off the National Security Council, because he reportedly, stories on Infowars.com, clashed with them and said, this is crazy.
[00:35:12.029 --> 00:35:15.711]  This is everything we said we wouldn't do.
[00:35:15.711 --> 00:35:19.352]  But then Trump wants to believe the military, but they're political!
[00:35:19.352 --> 00:35:22.694]  The guys at that level, we don't have General Dempsey anymore.
[00:35:22.694 --> 00:35:27.216]  We don't have Flynn anymore in the military.
[00:35:28.086 --> 00:35:36.354]  You've got this crowd the Republicans told you to get, because they'd be your friends, they'd defend America, they're the hawks!
[00:35:36.354 --> 00:35:46.684]  And sure enough, Chuckie Schumer was just on Fox News earlier, I saw the clip during the break, saying that Trump looks like a 98-pound weakling to China.
[00:35:46.684 --> 00:35:47.184]  A U.S.
[00:35:47.184 --> 00:35:52.089]  Senator undermining the President the day he meets with the Chinese Communist President-Dictator.
[00:35:54.130 --> 00:36:03.281]  And just undermining the stock market, and undermining confidence, and undermining just everything they do, trying to bring the country down, trying to discredit nationalism.
[00:36:03.281 --> 00:36:04.662]  And Trump's playing politics.
[00:36:04.662 --> 00:36:05.463]  He knows what's going on.
[00:36:06.496 --> 00:36:07.777]  I'm not even approving of it.
[00:36:07.777 --> 00:36:09.618]  I'm just saying I can sit back and I can tell you.
[00:36:09.618 --> 00:36:12.500]  He knows the public isn't fully filled in on all the facts.
[00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:14.441]  They need to have their memory refreshed.
[00:36:14.441 --> 00:36:21.205]  And so, in comes Rand Paul, in comes everybody else, in comes Ted Cruz, saying, you know, this is Al Qaeda we're about to back.
[00:36:21.205 --> 00:36:23.767]  There's a reason we didn't take out Assad before.
[00:36:23.767 --> 00:36:26.548]  It wasn't for love lost.
[00:36:26.548 --> 00:36:29.050]  It wasn't because we love Assad or he's perfect.
[00:36:29.050 --> 00:36:32.052]  It's because what you're going to put in is 50 times worse.
[00:36:34.005 --> 00:36:51.756]  And then our military, who had patriots in at the highest levels at that time, told Obama and everybody else, this came out in the news, they'll have a clear path out of the Middle East to invade Turkey, take down Turkey, if Irgun isn't already going to side with radical Islam, and then totally invade Europe.
[00:36:51.756 --> 00:36:55.518]  See, Europe began to fall at Constantinople.
[00:36:55.518 --> 00:36:59.461]  Istanbul, their capital, was formerly the head of the Byzantine
[00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:03.781]  Roman Empire.
[00:37:03.781 --> 00:37:06.022]  The Eastern Empire.
[00:37:06.022 --> 00:37:09.944]  The Western Empire in Rome fell in 410.
[00:37:09.944 --> 00:37:12.025]  The Byzantine Empire fell a lot later.
[00:37:12.025 --> 00:37:19.569]  To the Muslims, to an invasion, to a naval bombardment, to months of war, to siege.
[00:37:19.569 --> 00:37:24.832]  The men were put to death, the women into sex slavery, and sold worldwide.
[00:37:24.832 --> 00:37:25.773]  All throughout the old world.
[00:37:27.950 --> 00:37:32.315]  And now we see the same thing happening, and our traitor government's going along with it.
[00:37:32.315 --> 00:37:33.397]  It is crazy!
[00:37:34.935 --> 00:37:40.498]  So I'm about 99% sure that Trump now is going to start saying, well, I am concerned about the gas.
[00:37:40.498 --> 00:37:42.279]  Yelling, they'll say, oh, you're siding with Assad.
[00:37:42.279 --> 00:37:43.099]  You're for gas and kids.
[00:37:43.099 --> 00:37:46.181]  You know, he, he, well, I'm changing my mind on this now.
[00:37:46.181 --> 00:37:46.881]  Let me see.
[00:37:46.881 --> 00:37:51.904]  And then in come the surrogates to put out the truth of what's happening.
[00:37:51.904 --> 00:37:58.988]  Hopefully the public remembers all this from three, four, five years ago, but it all transpired and goes, oh yeah, that's why we're not backing overthrowing Assad.
[00:38:00.881 --> 00:38:04.302]  And the Russians, I would disagree with them in a second if they didn't have a good policy.
[00:38:04.302 --> 00:38:05.343]  It's in their neighborhood.
[00:38:05.343 --> 00:38:12.446]  They've been allied with Syria for 50 years.
[00:38:12.446 --> 00:38:13.386]  But the problem is...
[00:38:16.869 --> 00:38:23.395]  That all they're saying is, just, just, just get Al Qaeda out, get ISIS out, and then Assad will step aside and we can have a coalition government.
[00:38:23.395 --> 00:38:24.576]  We want stability here.
[00:38:24.576 --> 00:38:25.637]  That's not what they want.
[00:38:25.637 --> 00:38:29.280]  And so now Trump is looking at his options and now the drumbeat begins.
[00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:30.441]  Will he do something?
[00:38:30.441 --> 00:38:31.782]  Will he stand up against it?
[00:38:31.782 --> 00:38:37.527]  Will he take action?
[00:38:37.527 --> 00:38:38.768]  Will Trump do the right thing?
[00:38:43.476 --> 00:38:54.928]  Which means another war, another lie, another fraud, to go take out some moderate, put somebody in, 20, 30, 40, 50 times worse, and then that's on Europe's border.
[00:38:54.928 --> 00:39:01.935]  Another big piece of the puzzle, another big piece of the big board, and the big risk game taken by the Islamicists.
[00:39:01.935 --> 00:39:05.900]  Paul Watson has put out his big special report on the pedophile empire.
[00:39:07.093 --> 00:39:10.014]  The headline is Pedophiles Rule the World.
[00:39:10.014 --> 00:39:11.675]  It's 13 minutes, 50 seconds long.
[00:39:11.675 --> 00:39:13.115]  It's very powerful.
[00:39:13.115 --> 00:39:22.138]  It's all documented, admitted giant pedophile rings and satanist rings and serial killers kidnapping kids out of their backyards to deliver them to the pedophile rings.
[00:39:22.138 --> 00:39:25.199]  It's all convictions.
[00:39:25.199 --> 00:39:26.500]  It's all confirmed.
[00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:30.501]  I'm going to retweet it at InfoWars.com.
[00:39:30.501 --> 00:39:32.742]  At RealAlexJones.
[00:39:32.742 --> 00:39:36.023]  And I want everybody to spread this video because they're trying to block it.
[00:39:38.018 --> 00:39:50.607]  In fact, last night it wasn't even letting me into it, it was saying age restriction when there's nothing in it vulgar or nothing in it profane, just nothing but mainstream news articles and admissions of giant pedophile grids.
[00:39:50.607 --> 00:39:59.554]  We're going to get to that sometime today, but I do have so many guests coming on, Michael Snyder, Paul Craig Roberts, Dr. Group, and others, but I will get to it.
[00:39:59.554 --> 00:40:01.935]  So, that's that stack on what's happening in Syria.
[00:40:01.935 --> 00:40:06.819]  It could trigger, will probably trigger, a much larger war
[00:40:08.485 --> 00:40:16.732]  If we actually start bombarding the recognized government of Syria, which is a quasi-dictatorship.
[00:40:16.732 --> 00:40:17.392]  I'm not defending it.
[00:40:17.392 --> 00:40:19.114]  It's an oligarchy.
[00:40:19.114 --> 00:40:20.895]  Just like the EU is.
[00:40:20.895 --> 00:40:21.936]  So they can't shake their finger.
[00:40:21.936 --> 00:40:22.937]  It's unelected.
[00:40:22.937 --> 00:40:24.158]  Unelected board runs it.
[00:40:24.158 --> 00:40:26.480]  Just like China.
[00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:35.527]  And so, the Russians have said they'll defend if there is an invasion.
[00:40:35.527 --> 00:40:37.368]  Or if there is an attack.
[00:40:38.286 --> 00:40:42.528]  Unless they talk to President Trump and he gives them some other option.
[00:40:42.528 --> 00:40:46.090]  Russia challenges Trump to say what he would do about Syria.
[00:40:46.090 --> 00:40:48.591]  Because they've told Russia, this is your fault.
[00:40:48.591 --> 00:40:50.052]  You need to fix this.
[00:40:50.052 --> 00:40:54.014]  And Russia said, we're not the ones that ran the invasion six years ago.
[00:40:54.014 --> 00:40:56.115]  We're not the ones that backed all these radical Islamic groups.
[00:40:56.115 --> 00:40:57.956]  We didn't destabilize the whole Middle East.
[00:40:57.956 --> 00:40:59.096]  It's on our border.
[00:40:59.096 --> 00:41:00.237]  We're trying to stop this.
[00:41:02.332 --> 00:41:13.324]  And then again, I guess the different Republican committee members, there's a whole bunch of them, names that have had all these meetings, where they get up there and say Alex Jones is run by the Russians.
[00:41:13.324 --> 00:41:18.130]  Oh, because I don't want to have war with the Russians and be on the side of Islam?
[00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:30.406]  It's very insulting to sit there because I support Senator Paul, and I support Dr. Paul, and I support my own research, and Colonel Schaefer, and all these other military experts we have.
[00:41:30.406 --> 00:41:34.689]  Congress knows we're turning this country over to the worst people on the planet.
[00:41:34.689 --> 00:41:37.010]  Yeah, worst of the North Koreans.
[00:41:37.010 --> 00:41:38.571]  Worst of the North Korean communists.
[00:41:38.571 --> 00:41:40.713]  What is going on?
[00:41:40.713 --> 00:41:42.354]  Meanwhile, let's shift gears.
[00:41:42.354 --> 00:41:45.656]  Nunes steps aside from the Russia probe!
[00:41:48.911 --> 00:41:58.957]  While the ethics committee that's had complaints filed in it by the usual suspects, Adam Schiff and others, clears him of it.
[00:41:58.957 --> 00:42:11.804]  He went and saw the very same intelligence that Schiff just went and saw, but they're saying he wasn't allowed to tell the public that he saw intelligence that Trump was being spied on.
[00:42:11.804 --> 00:42:13.725]  They're claiming that's a leak when it's not.
[00:42:15.674 --> 00:42:18.604]  But then the Democrats are the ones leaking all over the place.
[00:42:18.604 --> 00:42:19.366]  It's amazing!
[00:42:21.283 --> 00:42:26.386]  So everything that they have accused Trump of, they've done.
[00:42:26.386 --> 00:42:32.950]  But Trump just keeps thinking if he is open about everything and nice and treats them well that they're gonna then clear him of everything.
[00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:34.691]  They're never going to clear Trump of anything.
[00:42:34.691 --> 00:42:36.332]  They say he's not the president.
[00:42:36.332 --> 00:42:37.753]  They say he should be removed.
[00:42:37.753 --> 00:42:40.634]  They say all the place that he needs to be killed.
[00:42:40.634 --> 00:42:44.917]  Top Democrats say we need to organize his downfall.
[00:42:44.917 --> 00:42:46.118]  They're calling for
[00:42:47.338 --> 00:42:48.700]  Coups against the President.
[00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:52.404]  They're calling for COG to be used against him.
[00:42:52.404 --> 00:42:57.549]  They're calling for the White House to be blown up.
[00:42:57.549 --> 00:43:04.016]  And nothing's being done to them when they're clearly violating the law.
[00:43:04.016 --> 00:43:06.079]  It's amazing.
[00:43:06.079 --> 00:43:08.742]  And they don't ever retract what they've said and say, oh, I didn't mean it, whatever.
[00:43:09.821 --> 00:43:15.147]  Because I've said stuff like, you call me a Russian or whatever, say I'm a traitor, I'll punch you in the nose.
[00:43:15.147 --> 00:43:20.554]  That's rhetorical, that's hyperbole, and I've said that's hyperbole.
[00:43:20.554 --> 00:43:27.723]  When we say it's an information war, we're going to crush you, all that kind of stuff, we've always promoted nonviolence.
[00:43:29.648 --> 00:43:30.248]  Offensively.
[00:43:30.248 --> 00:43:32.089]  We've always promoted information war.
[00:43:32.089 --> 00:43:33.710]  That's the name of the show.
[00:43:33.710 --> 00:43:37.091]  But again, there's branding everywhere that the Republicans are the ones that are violent.
[00:43:37.091 --> 00:43:42.053]  The Republicans are the ones that, out in Berkeley, started the whole Milo riot.
[00:43:42.053 --> 00:43:43.134]  It's the Republicans.
[00:43:43.134 --> 00:43:43.714]  They're the ones.
[00:43:43.714 --> 00:43:44.734]  It's the Patriots.
[00:43:44.734 --> 00:43:45.415]  They're the ones.
[00:43:45.415 --> 00:43:45.875]  They're the ones.
[00:43:45.875 --> 00:43:55.479]  And then all the WikiLeaks come out and it's the Democratic Party starting riots and starting fights and calling for it, just like they funded the Arab Spring and the Civil War and the overthrow of the Ukrainian government that was elected
[00:43:57.850 --> 00:44:08.959]  And just like they've been caught now, Jordan Soros connected group, it's on Infowars.com, funded group, reports Soros link group behind chemical attack in Syria.
[00:44:08.959 --> 00:44:14.923]  Chemical attack has all the hallmarks of a false flag, which they've tried a whole bunch of other times and have been caught doing.
[00:44:14.923 --> 00:44:16.484]  But let's get to this since I mentioned it.
[00:44:16.484 --> 00:44:23.230]  CNN has child read off a script to push for war in Syria to oust Assad.
[00:44:23.230 --> 00:44:24.711]  This is the most amazing video.
[00:44:26.721 --> 00:44:36.263]  Where they don't even hide the fact that they've got children reading off teleprompters about what they saw as the eyewitnesses.
[00:44:36.263 --> 00:44:40.224]  I saw the planes and the missiles and then I could not breathe.
[00:44:40.224 --> 00:44:47.105]  Oh, please, please Trump help us.
[00:44:47.105 --> 00:44:55.467]  And most of these people are families that have been brought in to Syria.
[00:44:55.467 --> 00:44:56.267]  Sunni settlers.
[00:44:59.209 --> 00:45:06.655]  Going into one of the only partially Shiite Muslim countries in the world.
[00:45:06.655 --> 00:45:08.296]  Think about that.
[00:45:08.296 --> 00:45:14.481]  But just like they had the daughter of the PR firm go and say she saw the babies in the incubators, she'd never even, it turned out, been to Kuwait.
[00:45:15.430 --> 00:45:19.795]  Later came out in mainstream news, it was totally fake, and then they were stomping on the babies out of the incubators.
[00:45:19.795 --> 00:45:21.316]  Well, this is better than that.
[00:45:21.316 --> 00:45:23.779]  We've got real kids that died in a real chemical attack.
[00:45:23.779 --> 00:45:25.761]  The media will probably say that I said that no kids died.
[00:45:25.761 --> 00:45:26.362]  No, it's terrible.
[00:45:26.362 --> 00:45:27.343]  It's a terrible war.
[00:45:27.343 --> 00:45:30.146]  Atrocities on both sides, but who started it?
[00:45:30.146 --> 00:45:32.749]  And who are those groups?
[00:45:34.189 --> 00:45:35.429]  This is a no-brainer.
[00:45:35.429 --> 00:45:37.310]  And Rand Paul is right.
[00:45:37.310 --> 00:45:41.691]  Trump needs to really pull back and think about who we're about to back if we do this and then what's going to come out of it.
[00:45:41.691 --> 00:45:46.832]  And understand the media is still going to blame you for it because you didn't start it and you didn't do it.
[00:45:46.832 --> 00:45:54.954]  But they've already hung it around your neck and you've already come out and said Syria is now my problem.
[00:45:54.954 --> 00:45:59.915]  Syria is your problem when Obama started it.
[00:45:59.915 --> 00:46:01.395]  Okay?
[00:46:01.395 --> 00:46:03.696]  The media says Obamacare is Trump's fault now.
[00:46:05.598 --> 00:46:06.919]  This is the upside-down planet.
[00:46:06.919 --> 00:46:11.141]  So if you're a radio listener, I'll describe this, but the article's on Infowars.com if you want to see it.
[00:46:11.141 --> 00:46:21.326]  This has to get out there, folks, because this is what CNN's been caught doing about aluminum tubes, yellow cake, Nigerian uranium, everything.
[00:46:21.326 --> 00:46:28.630]  And now they're back, and I saw it all yesterday and this morning, the little kids clearly all saying the same thing about what they saw and what they did.
[00:46:28.630 --> 00:46:29.811]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[00:46:35.663 --> 00:46:36.924]  So here's the sad little clip.
[00:46:36.924 --> 00:46:37.324]  Here it is.
[00:46:37.324 --> 00:46:42.847]  Ivana, do you blame President Assad for this?
[00:46:42.847 --> 00:46:44.487]  Yes.
[00:46:44.487 --> 00:46:46.989]  What is your message to President Assad?
[00:46:46.989 --> 00:46:53.052]  I am very sad.
[00:46:53.052 --> 00:47:00.135]  A lot of died and no one helped them.
[00:47:00.135 --> 00:47:02.757]  The world is watching.
[00:47:02.757 --> 00:47:05.158]  The world doesn't do anything.
[00:47:05.962 --> 00:47:07.623]  What do you want the world to do?
[00:47:23.149 --> 00:47:26.811]  We can, together, we can help them.
[00:47:26.811 --> 00:47:29.353]  Together, we can save them.
[00:47:29.353 --> 00:47:39.119]  Ana, when you saw the video and the pictures of what happened in Syria this week, what did you think?
[00:47:39.119 --> 00:47:48.765]  I am very sad about this 100 Syrian workers in Syria.
[00:47:48.765 --> 00:47:52.408]  By the way, I forgot to add, we'll put the London Guardian article up on screen.
[00:47:53.789 --> 00:48:02.811]  This little girl, undisputedly, works for CNN, basically, and was, quote, successfully evacuated over a year ago.
[00:48:02.811 --> 00:48:05.111]  Let's put that London Guardian article.
[00:48:05.111 --> 00:48:08.792]  Where is Bana, girl who tweeted from Aleppo, is safely evacuated?
[00:48:08.792 --> 00:48:20.094]  The Guardian, Turkish NGO, tweets picture of seven-year-old aid worker and says family have been rescued from perceived city.
[00:48:20.094 --> 00:48:22.475]  But CNN's telling us that this is
[00:48:23.743 --> 00:48:28.205]  That's Monday, December 19th, 2016.
[00:48:28.205 --> 00:48:32.627]  So that's five months ago.
[00:48:32.627 --> 00:48:33.408]  So there you go.
[00:48:33.408 --> 00:48:34.468]  And it just goes on and on.
[00:48:34.468 --> 00:48:41.231]  And of course we have famous stuff in Syria where they've even got fake gunfire going off and the guy goes, I go live now!
[00:48:41.231 --> 00:48:42.092]  Start gunfire!
[00:48:42.092 --> 00:48:44.373]  Remember all those clips?
[00:48:44.373 --> 00:48:47.554]  I mean, we can pull up, it's on YouTube.
[00:48:47.554 --> 00:48:50.616]  Babies in incubator, fake testimony.
[00:48:50.616 --> 00:48:51.336]  Fake, fake.
[00:48:52.904 --> 00:48:55.466]  Gulf War 1 testimony.
[00:48:55.466 --> 00:48:57.487]  Baby and incubator fake testimony.
[00:48:57.487 --> 00:48:59.088]  There's even been 60-minute pieces.
[00:48:59.088 --> 00:49:00.229]  The Gulf War lie.
[00:49:00.229 --> 00:49:01.790]  Babies thrown out of incubators.
[00:49:01.790 --> 00:49:03.090]  And it's the very same thing.
[00:49:03.090 --> 00:49:06.353]  I was there as they pulled them out and they stomped on them.
[00:49:06.353 --> 00:49:09.094]  Then they delivered them and hugged them.
[00:49:09.094 --> 00:49:12.977]  Turned out, lived in the U.S., boarding school, wasn't even in Kuwait.
[00:49:12.977 --> 00:49:17.540]  The daughter of the top PR company.
[00:49:17.540 --> 00:49:19.301]  I'm not saying Saddam Hussein was a good guy.
[00:49:20.649 --> 00:49:25.450]  It was lies that brought us into that to then overthrow him and put something in even worse.
[00:49:25.450 --> 00:49:26.511]  Again, why?
[00:49:26.511 --> 00:49:30.772]  To turn the Middle East into a hellhole, even worse than it is, run by the worst people.
[00:49:30.772 --> 00:49:34.753]  This is a destabilization program of the Middle East, just like they're doing it to us.
[00:49:34.753 --> 00:49:38.294]  The globalists hate the Muslims, the globalists hate the Christians, the globalists hate everybody.
[00:49:38.294 --> 00:49:39.234]  They're technocrats.
[00:49:39.234 --> 00:49:42.375]  Are they using Islam because it's so barbarous to take down the West?
[00:49:42.375 --> 00:49:43.115]  Absolutely.
[00:49:43.115 --> 00:49:44.956]  But I actually care about the Muslims of the Middle East.
[00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:49.502]  Even though a lot of them are brainwashed and hate my Christian guts.
[00:49:49.502 --> 00:49:52.103]  The point is the facts are the facts.
[00:49:52.103 --> 00:50:07.051]  Every regime where women can go to college and don't wear hoods over their heads and have a good industrial system and have a tourism is destroyed by our government and others funding the most radical Muslims on the planet to invade them.
[00:50:07.051 --> 00:50:11.434]  That's why Rand Paul's urging Trump not to take military action in Syria in fullwars.com.
[00:50:11.434 --> 00:50:13.235]  I don't want to support people who hate our country.
[00:50:14.261 --> 00:50:19.864]  We need to have the military come out again and say, I don't want to be Al-Qaeda slash ISIS's air force.
[00:50:19.864 --> 00:50:22.066]  I was all for our military being there taking out ISIS.
[00:50:22.066 --> 00:50:23.727]  We've almost beaten them.
[00:50:23.727 --> 00:50:24.607]  They're driving them out.
[00:50:24.607 --> 00:50:25.288]  McCain's mad.
[00:50:25.288 --> 00:50:26.749]  He flies over there a month ago.
[00:50:26.749 --> 00:50:28.290]  You can just see the setup for this.
[00:50:28.290 --> 00:50:30.211]  He flies back.
[00:50:30.211 --> 00:50:30.651]  Boom!
[00:50:30.651 --> 00:50:41.998]  Right when ISIS is getting ready to give up, right when they're starting to leave, right when they're getting their butt kicked in Iraq, right when it's all happening magically, Assad does the one thing that'll get him thrown out.
[00:50:43.703 --> 00:50:46.606]  And he's denying it and of course saying he hasn't done it.
[00:50:46.606 --> 00:50:47.647]  Fatty, fatty, boom, boom.
[00:50:47.647 --> 00:50:50.671]  Let's put that back on screen.
[00:50:50.671 --> 00:50:52.492]  North Korean threatens war with the U.S.
[00:50:52.492 --> 00:50:56.897]  after Senator John McCain called despot Kim Jong-un a crazy fat kid.
[00:50:56.897 --> 00:50:57.298]  Wow!
[00:50:57.298 --> 00:50:59.080]  Finally, John McCain tells the truth.
[00:51:01.161 --> 00:51:03.543]  They say you can't take on the man and win.
[00:51:03.543 --> 00:51:08.587]  That one small company doesn't stand a chance against the corporate behemoths with all their money and lawyers.
[00:51:08.587 --> 00:51:10.609]  But they don't know Harry's.
[00:51:10.609 --> 00:51:11.930]  How's Harry's done it?
[00:51:11.930 --> 00:51:12.691]  Simple.
[00:51:12.691 --> 00:51:15.633]  By owning the factory and selling directly to you.
[00:51:15.633 --> 00:51:18.356]  Harry's sells their incredible razor blades online.
[00:51:18.356 --> 00:51:20.458]  They ship directly from their site to you.
[00:51:20.458 --> 00:51:21.639]  And do it for a lot less.
[00:51:22.179 --> 00:51:27.264]  And while those other guys rake in huge profits, Harry's passes the savings directly back to you.
[00:51:27.264 --> 00:51:28.145]  The result?
[00:51:28.145 --> 00:51:31.409]  A quality shave and more money in your pocket.
[00:51:31.409 --> 00:51:32.289]  Don't believe it?
[00:51:32.289 --> 00:51:34.251]  Try Harry's for yourself, for free.
[00:51:34.251 --> 00:51:36.514]  Just pay $3 in shipping when you sign up.
[00:51:36.514 --> 00:51:41.379]  Your set comes with a razor, shave gel, travel cover, and a post-shave balm.
[00:51:41.379 --> 00:51:43.841]  That's an almost $20 value, free.
[00:51:43.841 --> 00:51:45.443]  There's no catch and no commitment.
[00:51:45.723 --> 00:51:46.244]  Think about this.
[00:52:01.618 --> 00:52:14.120]  Your community's aging water infrastructure systems are very likely to be contaminated with heavy metals like lead, disinfection chemicals like ammonia, chlorine, and chloramines, and pharmaceuticals like statins, pain meds, and antidepressants.
[00:52:14.120 --> 00:52:18.361]  And no, water treatment plants are not equipped to filter these pharmaceutical toxins out.
[00:52:18.361 --> 00:52:22.162]  Protect your family's water supply with a trusted Big Berkey Water Filter.

[00:54:01.107 --> 00:54:26.824]  Before you slip into unconsciousness I'd like to have another kiss Another flashing chance at bliss Another kiss
[00:54:33.462 --> 00:54:47.569]  The world is on the precipice of massive wars in the South China Sea, on the Korean Peninsula, the sticks out in the middle of it, in the Middle East.
[00:54:47.569 --> 00:54:53.732]  And we have economic warfare taking place against the UK for Brexit.
[00:54:53.732 --> 00:54:59.575]  We have military threats by Juncker, the unelected head of the EU, the EU dictator.
[00:55:02.529 --> 00:55:08.535]  And we have calls to shut down the true and independent press in this country.
[00:55:08.535 --> 00:55:12.118]  The Democrats organizing violence and the overthrow of the president everywhere.
[00:55:12.118 --> 00:55:18.264]  And even CBS News admitting that Soros groups are funding Black Lives Matter, but it's calling for the killing of police.
[00:55:18.264 --> 00:55:21.648]  But all that's okay!
[00:55:21.648 --> 00:55:22.829]  But they want to ban our speech.
[00:55:22.829 --> 00:55:24.611]  They say it's hurtful or mean.
[00:55:25.930 --> 00:55:31.655]  And they take it out of context, edit it together, to then deceive their dumbed-down viewers and listeners.
[00:55:31.655 --> 00:55:35.518]  It's an amazing time to be alive.
[00:55:35.518 --> 00:55:39.241]  Coming up, oh, there's so much to get to in the second hour.
[00:55:39.241 --> 00:55:45.647]  We're gonna get Dr. Paul Craig Roberts on and more.
[00:55:45.647 --> 00:55:53.193]  We're also going to be getting into the president of China, the dictator, visiting.
[00:55:53.193 --> 00:55:54.174]  That kicks off today.
[00:55:56.254 --> 00:55:57.816]  We're going to be showing it all.
[00:55:57.816 --> 00:56:07.365]  We're going to also air the video that's on Infowars.com, Pedophiles Rule the World, by Paul Joseph Watson, that needs to go viral.
[00:56:07.365 --> 00:56:08.946]  And we really should do a special report.
[00:56:08.946 --> 00:56:18.516]  I just mentioned this little girl, who they've had on CNN for years, who was evacuated out of Syria last year, and then there she is hugging Ergun, Banna,
[00:56:20.043 --> 00:56:34.794]  All been seven-year-old Syrian girl meets Turkey's President Erdogan, but then we're seeing on the news she's in Turkey telling the President what she'd like to see him do.
[00:56:34.794 --> 00:56:39.937]  This is just crazy propaganda.
[00:56:39.937 --> 00:56:43.260]  CNN, it's been released the last decade,
[00:56:44.495 --> 00:56:52.962]  routinely receives millions of dollars per program, per quarter, to produce pro-Islamic news.
[00:56:52.962 --> 00:56:56.125]  So you ask, why are they so anti-American, so pro-Islamic?
[00:56:56.125 --> 00:56:57.826]  They're paid massive amounts of money.
[00:56:57.826 --> 00:56:59.388]  You can search engine that.
[00:56:59.388 --> 00:57:02.070]  Those different governments.
[00:57:02.070 --> 00:57:07.515]  Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, they just pump money into it for little special reports.
[00:57:09.377 --> 00:57:15.918]  We're funded by listeners and viewers like you, and that's why I want to encourage everybody to go to mfulwarsstore.com today.
[00:57:15.918 --> 00:57:25.340]  For the first time in four years of our X2 True Nascent Iodine, the good halogen, we're running out.
[00:57:25.340 --> 00:57:27.380]  Might have some of the last runs coming up here pretty soon.
[00:57:27.380 --> 00:57:31.881]  If you want to stock up on it and support the broadcast, mfulwarslife.com, mfulwarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:57:31.881 --> 00:57:34.021]  Caveman, the ultimate paleo formula, is out.
[00:57:39.326 --> 00:57:41.207]  It's finally back at InfoWareStore.com.

[00:57:45.750 --> 00:57:47.992]  It's got turmeric and so much more in it.
[00:57:47.992 --> 00:57:48.932]  Check it out for yourself.
[00:57:48.932 --> 00:57:54.516]  It is an amazing formula with bee pollen, chaga mushroom, and so much more.
[00:57:54.516 --> 00:57:56.758]  And it tastes great as well.
[00:57:56.758 --> 00:58:00.300]  Also, just briefly, I saw an article today attacking us.
[00:58:00.300 --> 00:58:01.941]  I think it was on Vox.
[00:58:01.941 --> 00:58:03.822]  And I read most of it.
[00:58:03.822 --> 00:58:05.744]  It was a long article about Jones and Vince.
[00:58:09.173 --> 00:58:14.016]  Mold and fungus crisis, and then sells a pill for it.
[00:58:14.016 --> 00:58:17.359]  That's like saying I invented band-aids because I invented cuts.
[00:58:17.359 --> 00:58:20.341]  They admit all the candida and stuff's out of control.
[00:58:20.341 --> 00:58:24.003]  The big fancy clinics all over have similar systems to what we sell that, by the way, sold out.
[00:58:24.003 --> 00:58:28.066]  We also sell high-quality probiotic.
[00:58:28.066 --> 00:58:31.148]  Everybody knows probiotic's good.
[00:58:31.148 --> 00:58:35.451]  But again, they're just attacking us on every front, and just act like we're insane.
[00:58:36.877 --> 00:58:43.027]  I mean, it's well known what's going on in the gut with the overgrowth of the fungus and all the rest of it.
[00:58:43.027 --> 00:58:45.591]  Because the pesticides kill the good bacteria.
[00:58:45.591 --> 00:58:48.656]  And then it creates a vacuum they breathe in.
[00:58:51.780 --> 00:58:53.221]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[00:58:53.221 --> 00:58:54.541]  It took you over a year to do it.
[00:58:54.541 --> 00:58:55.741]  Why is this so good?
[00:58:55.741 --> 00:59:01.043]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[00:59:01.043 --> 00:59:14.586]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[00:59:14.586 --> 00:59:15.947]  Right now with all the refugees,
[00:59:16.727 --> 00:59:18.368]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[00:59:18.368 --> 00:59:20.890]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[00:59:20.890 --> 00:59:22.231]  These are all parasites.
[00:59:22.231 --> 00:59:23.332]  Tell us about all the stuff it says.
[00:59:23.332 --> 00:59:24.693]  There's so many things that are in it.
[00:59:24.693 --> 00:59:29.196]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[00:59:29.196 --> 00:59:32.358]  I recommend doing the parasite plans at least twice a year.
[00:59:32.418 --> 00:59:35.520]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[00:59:35.520 --> 00:59:36.580]  It just came back in yesterday.
[00:59:36.580 --> 00:59:38.501]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[00:59:38.501 --> 00:59:39.522]  And folks, you can't lose.
[00:59:39.522 --> 00:59:42.224]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[00:59:42.224 --> 00:59:45.505]  And you support the broadcast, Infowarslife.com.
[00:59:45.505 --> 00:59:47.747]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[00:59:47.747 --> 00:59:53.850]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[00:59:53.850 --> 00:59:56.492]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:15.456 --> 01:00:20.298]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[01:00:20.298 --> 01:00:25.739]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:25.739 --> 01:00:31.661]  Xi Jinping supposedly arriving today, that's what CNN said at the time of his dictator.
[01:00:31.661 --> 01:00:38.804]  I thought it was tomorrow, but we're going to have breaking news for you on that front coming up in the start of the next segment.
[01:00:38.804 --> 01:00:42.065]  I really cannot break down enough to you
[01:00:43.604 --> 01:00:46.467]  How unbelievable the global situation is.
[01:00:46.467 --> 01:00:50.650]  Michael Snyder, Dr. Paul Gregg Roberts, and others are going to be joining us.
[01:00:50.650 --> 01:00:52.512]  The liberals, I think, are really desperate.
[01:00:52.512 --> 01:00:54.313]  They just launched a false flag.
[01:00:54.313 --> 01:00:55.935]  Ron Paul believes, I believe.
[01:00:55.935 --> 01:00:56.976]  The evidence is overwhelming.
[01:00:56.976 --> 01:00:59.778]  The Al-Qaeda folks have been caught doing it before.
[01:00:59.778 --> 01:01:00.238]  You know them.
[01:01:00.238 --> 01:01:01.740]  Rebranded as ISIS.
[01:01:01.740 --> 01:01:05.303]  Al-Nusra, the good rebels in Syria, as CNN calls them.
[01:01:06.818 --> 01:01:09.420]  I've been saying false flag, false flag, I've been saying a lot.
[01:01:09.420 --> 01:01:12.502]  Look for one in Syria, because John McCain was just there a month ago.
[01:01:12.502 --> 01:01:14.244]  In fact, when that came out, he snuck over there.
[01:01:14.244 --> 01:01:15.805]  I said, look for a false flag.
[01:01:15.805 --> 01:01:17.346]  They've already been trying these chemical attacks.
[01:01:17.346 --> 01:01:18.667]  Look for them to do it again.
[01:01:18.667 --> 01:01:20.688]  This is very predictable.
[01:01:20.688 --> 01:01:23.290]  I've never heard Ron Paul be so just absolutely certain, though.
[01:01:23.290 --> 01:01:25.612]  He's like, this is 100% false flag.
[01:01:25.612 --> 01:01:27.173]  Because of the common sense.
[01:01:27.173 --> 01:01:30.736]  Quibono, in Latin, who benefits?
[01:01:30.736 --> 01:01:33.358]  But as I sit here and I look at this today, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:01:35.023 --> 01:01:44.370]  It's just crazy that CNN immediately and then the Joint Chiefs, yeah we have witnesses on the ground that some planes flew over and some bombs got dropped.
[01:01:44.370 --> 01:01:55.518]  And then Syria says, must have been chemicals that they had, and of course you have the rebels admittedly cooking up chemicals and they've been caught using them and doing it.
[01:01:55.518 --> 01:01:56.198]  That's admitted.
[01:01:56.198 --> 01:01:57.419]  The UN's admitted it.
[01:01:57.419 --> 01:01:58.660]  They've been caught on video doing it.
[01:01:58.660 --> 01:02:02.663]  That's what's so crazy is, this all hinges on acting like there's no memory.
[01:02:03.479 --> 01:02:05.221]  Just like we're spying on Trump.
[01:02:05.221 --> 01:02:06.822]  We've got the intercepts, the proof.
[01:02:06.822 --> 01:02:08.884]  That was, you know, two months ago.
[01:02:08.884 --> 01:02:11.247]  Trump goes, that's illegal to release that.
[01:02:11.247 --> 01:02:13.309]  Plus, you don't because we didn't do that.
[01:02:13.309 --> 01:02:14.290]  Oh, actually, we never did it.
[01:02:14.290 --> 01:02:15.151]  You're crazy.
[01:02:15.151 --> 01:02:16.232]  And then, of course, it all comes out.
[01:02:16.232 --> 01:02:20.156]  Susan Rice, Obama, the unmasking, it's all illegal.
[01:02:20.156 --> 01:02:23.319]  But by then, they've always changed the subject and then put Trump.
[01:02:23.319 --> 01:02:25.661]  Remember what Michael Moore and so many others said?
[01:02:25.661 --> 01:02:27.083]  They said that after he gets in office,
[01:02:29.110 --> 01:02:33.714]  He's going to be faced with all these different global crises and then we'll be able to bring him down.
[01:02:33.714 --> 01:02:37.597]  And they're doing it!
[01:02:37.597 --> 01:02:40.520]  And Bannon's gone!
[01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:44.644]  Bannon threatened to quit if removed from National Security Council role.
[01:02:44.644 --> 01:02:47.126]  Report!
[01:02:47.126 --> 01:02:52.591]  Chief White House strategist Stephen Bannon was unhappy with the decision to remove him from his role at the National Security Council.
[01:02:53.737 --> 01:02:54.217]  Threatened to quit.
[01:02:54.217 --> 01:02:57.220]  Thought he was threatening to quit the council over the war.
[01:02:57.220 --> 01:03:01.043]  According to a new report, you can't believe anything comes out of the New York Times.
[01:03:01.043 --> 01:03:10.271]  The New York Times reported Wednesday evening that Bannon resisted the move and threatened to resign if the change was made, but the Times said his team had denied that and he never made such a statement.
[01:03:10.271 --> 01:03:10.791]  Yeah.
[01:03:10.791 --> 01:03:13.753]  I mean, who are these people inside leaking it?
[01:03:13.753 --> 01:03:14.034]  Kushner?
[01:03:15.464 --> 01:03:22.929]  Oh, there are all sorts of articles out there in major newspapers that, oh, I must not like Jewish people because our intel is Kushner's leaking stuff.
[01:03:22.929 --> 01:03:28.173]  It's the craziest political correct garbage everywhere.
[01:03:28.173 --> 01:03:29.714]  It's just maddening.
[01:03:29.714 --> 01:03:36.579]  It's like I criticized the Nazi collaborator George Soros, and there's articles saying I must be anti-Semitic.
[01:03:36.579 --> 01:03:38.420]  It just doesn't work anymore to use that.
[01:03:40.339 --> 01:03:50.268]  Bannon, who led President Trump's campaign in its final months, was elevated in January to position on the NSC Principals Committee, drawing widespread criticism that Trump was trying to politicize the Council.
[01:03:50.268 --> 01:03:55.552]  The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Director of National Intelligence had their roles downgraded in the move.
[01:03:55.552 --> 01:03:56.933]  National Security Advisor H.R.
[01:03:56.933 --> 01:04:02.819]  McMaster has now reversed some of those changes, a move that was approved by Trump, according to senior White House officials.
[01:04:02.819 --> 01:04:04.140]  Again, John McCain said yesterday,
[01:04:05.677 --> 01:04:10.442]  The normal order of things in Washington is now coming back to equilibrium.
[01:04:10.442 --> 01:04:12.584]  I'm paraphrasing, but that was the quote.
[01:04:12.584 --> 01:04:17.789]  The normal order is now returning to where it should be, yes.
[01:04:17.789 --> 01:04:27.960]  The normal order of just a bunch of liars running around backing the most radical Muslim groups, overthrowing nations that are much freer.
[01:04:29.810 --> 01:04:34.613]  And Judge Knapp says amassing Americans for reasons other than national security is called espionage.
[01:04:34.613 --> 01:04:41.197]  And when we come back, I've got some more clips on that front.
[01:04:41.197 --> 01:04:42.618]  We've also got CNN.
[01:04:42.618 --> 01:04:46.600]  Again, kids reading off teleprompters.
[01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:47.701]  Please come invade.
[01:04:47.701 --> 01:04:48.601]  I am here.
[01:04:48.601 --> 01:04:49.982]  I need your help in Syria.
[01:04:49.982 --> 01:04:51.623]  I am here.
[01:04:51.623 --> 01:04:51.943]  Help me.
[01:04:51.943 --> 01:04:55.025]  Meanwhile, they're like, you know, in CNN studios or whatever.
[01:04:55.025 --> 01:04:57.487]  I mean, it's just there's no end to CNN, folks.
[01:05:01.334 --> 01:05:06.739]  Corey Lewandowski, Paul Manafort, Mike Flynn, Steve Bannon, and now Devin Nunes.
[01:05:06.739 --> 01:05:09.963]  It seems the left's intimidation tactics are actually working.
[01:05:09.963 --> 01:05:18.151]  Nunes is the latest to be asked to step aside after an intense few weeks of grilling from the left, as the House Intelligence Chairman has now recused himself from the Russian probe.
[01:05:18.151 --> 01:05:20.033]  Isn't that too convenient for the Democrats?
[01:05:20.273 --> 01:05:26.402]  To have the only one involved in this Russian probe who actually seems to care about the truth of the matter, step aside and recuse himself.
[01:05:26.402 --> 01:05:37.317]  Just to rub our noses in it, Representative Adam Schiff, Democrat member of the House Intelligence Committee, made a public statement moments after Nunes' announcement saying how pleased he was to hear of Nunes' recusal.
[01:05:37.597 --> 01:05:41.919]  So now, the Democrats have a monopoly on the political witch hunt that is the Russian probe.
[01:05:41.919 --> 01:05:42.819]  Thanks, Nunes.
[01:05:42.819 --> 01:05:46.460]  The Republicans have gotten their leverage democratically and refuse to use it.
[01:05:46.460 --> 01:05:50.422]  The Democrats get their leverage with smear campaigns and use it successfully.
[01:05:50.422 --> 01:05:53.643]  And if we keep allowing them to do it, they're going to continue.
[01:05:53.643 --> 01:05:56.364]  President Trump, the swamp is draining us.
[01:05:56.364 --> 01:05:58.725]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.
[01:06:01.795 --> 01:06:03.356]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:06:03.356 --> 01:06:09.258]  I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money on one of the best new off-the-grid products of 2017.
[01:06:09.258 --> 01:06:11.819]  And seriously, I really think everyone should have one of these.
[01:06:11.819 --> 01:06:17.621]  I'm talking about the PPX solar generator system from our friends at Solutions from Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[01:06:17.621 --> 01:06:23.323]  The PPX is so small you can put it in your pocket, but so powerful you can run some 110 appliances at your house.
[01:06:23.763 --> 01:06:26.727]  Like a small refrigerator, so you can keep food from spoiling.
[01:06:26.727 --> 01:06:32.293]  Plus, you can take it with you to jumpstart cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, heavy equipment, even airplanes.
[01:06:32.293 --> 01:06:39.321]  The system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity, allowing you to create your own private power grid, literally anywhere in the world.
[01:06:39.321 --> 01:06:43.867]  Perfect for cabins, remote locations, anytime you need to get off the grid for a while.
[01:06:44.127 --> 01:06:47.430]  Go to privatepowergrid.com to watch this thing in action.
[01:06:47.430 --> 01:06:49.532]  That's privatepowergrid.com.
[01:06:49.532 --> 01:06:55.258]  Even better, use coupon code PRIVATE at checkout and get a second PPX energy unit for free.
[01:06:55.258 --> 01:06:57.680]  Check it out at privatepowergrid.com.
[01:06:57.680 --> 01:07:03.786]  That's privatepowergrid.com.
[01:07:03.786 --> 01:07:05.247]  Let's go to Debit in Florida.
[01:07:05.247 --> 01:07:06.068]  Debit in Florida.
[01:07:06.068 --> 01:07:06.509]  You're on the air.
[01:07:07.458 --> 01:07:07.918]  Great!
[01:07:07.918 --> 01:07:09.039]  Hey, thank you so much.
[01:07:09.039 --> 01:07:13.641]  Listen, I have bought your products and I gotta say they're amazing.
[01:07:13.641 --> 01:07:15.262]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it.
[01:07:15.262 --> 01:07:22.666]  Because I've got Caveman, Superman Vitality, Secret 12, Vitamin Mineral Fusion, I've got the Body Armor.
[01:07:22.666 --> 01:07:23.667]  Wow, thank you.
[01:07:23.667 --> 01:07:26.068]  You're the type of listener that makes it all possible.
[01:07:26.068 --> 01:07:27.889]  Which super-ceutical do you like best?
[01:07:27.889 --> 01:07:31.371]  I really like the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, to be honest.
[01:07:31.371 --> 01:07:31.971]  That's amazing.
[01:07:31.991 --> 01:07:32.631]  Incredible.
[01:07:32.631 --> 01:07:35.673]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[01:07:35.673 --> 01:07:37.033]  Like, I haven't felt this week.
[01:07:37.033 --> 01:07:38.714]  My morning was fantastic.
[01:07:38.714 --> 01:07:39.955]  And I love you guys.
[01:07:39.955 --> 01:07:42.096]  I love the InfoWars crew.
[01:07:42.096 --> 01:07:48.959]  And I just want to, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence, just buy it.
[01:07:48.959 --> 01:07:49.999]  You will love it.
[01:07:49.999 --> 01:07:50.499]  I'm telling you.
[01:07:50.499 --> 01:07:52.140]  I've never bought a bad product.
[01:07:52.140 --> 01:07:56.562]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:07:56.562 --> 01:07:57.442]  It's a win-win.
[01:07:57.442 --> 01:07:58.223]  InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:08:06.397 --> 01:08:13.265]  The globalists' great error is to believe that as they collapse humanity, they end up on top.
[01:08:13.265 --> 01:08:22.076]  The truth is, humanity is coming down fast, but we're miles above them on our journey to hell.
[01:08:22.076 --> 01:08:24.739]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:38.875 --> 01:08:42.718]  Xi Jinping is arriving at like 6 o'clock in Mar-a-Lago.
[01:08:42.718 --> 01:08:44.219]  They're going to have dinner and things.
[01:08:44.219 --> 01:08:46.801]  Probably won't have any press conferences or anything until tomorrow.
[01:08:46.801 --> 01:08:50.184]  We'll be covering that live, obviously, because that is important.
[01:08:50.184 --> 01:08:59.531]  He's a communist Chinese dictator with massive tensions, unparalleled since the ceasefire on the Korean War in July of 1953.
[01:08:59.531 --> 01:09:07.498]  That is a big deal, with North Korea threatening to nuke everybody as usual, and of course the Democrats helped give him all that technology to do it.
[01:09:08.473 --> 01:09:29.180]  But we have the Democrats today, with the Senate and the House Intelligence Committees, just running around on this witch hunt about Russians everywhere, unmasking people, and then the intel is clear, there's nothing there, Congressman Nunes talks about it, and then he gets ethics complaints on him, so he recuses himself.
[01:09:29.180 --> 01:09:34.922]  When did Democrats start recusing themselves for being connected to Hillary Clinton, and the uranium deals, and all the rest of it?
[01:09:34.922 --> 01:09:35.562]  I'm sick of it!
[01:09:36.738 --> 01:09:39.884]  And the media is like, oh, Alex is scared of a Russian investigation.
[01:09:39.884 --> 01:09:47.216]  No, actually, I'm scared that they're going to find out I'm a Martian and that the moon's made of cheese.
[01:09:47.216 --> 01:09:49.160]  Trump is trying to restore our republic.
[01:09:51.391 --> 01:09:59.393]  And you've got the Republicans and the Democratic Party ganging up on Trump, trying to make him do their will geopolitically, to go start wars in Syria, you name it.
[01:09:59.393 --> 01:10:01.474]  And notice they're already blaming Trump.
[01:10:01.474 --> 01:10:11.897]  Oh, this is all happening in Syria because of you, when Hillary and the Democrats and the globalists admittedly started the civil war, bringing in the jihadis six years ago.
[01:10:11.897 --> 01:10:15.958]  Hell, they'll probably blame Libya next on Trump.
[01:10:15.958 --> 01:10:17.158]  That failed state.
[01:10:17.158 --> 01:10:18.699]  So it's an amazing time to be alive.
[01:10:20.905 --> 01:10:23.826]  I wanted to get Dr. Group on for two segments, and I appreciate him coming on.
[01:10:23.826 --> 01:10:39.132]  Then we've got Dr. Paul Craig Roberts joining us on the military, the economy, Michael Snyder, Paul Watson's special report, Millie Weaver, John Rappaport, and others.
[01:10:39.132 --> 01:10:41.773]  But I wanted to get Group on, and I guess it's a good time to get him on.
[01:10:43.488 --> 01:10:59.818]  Because we don't just see them kicking us off ad rolls we can't advertise on Google and trying to get us kicked off Google completely Democratic Party openly saying that we don't just see things like that we see industrial type stuff where where we're getting our materials getting messed with or
[01:11:01.710 --> 01:11:03.011]  Regulators coming after us.
[01:11:03.011 --> 01:11:04.832]  All sorts of stuff.
[01:11:04.832 --> 01:11:09.936]  In a message to everyone that don't mess with the New World Order or we'll come shut you down.
[01:11:09.936 --> 01:11:11.597]  You're already shutting down society.
[01:11:11.597 --> 01:11:12.898]  You're already taking over.
[01:11:12.898 --> 01:11:14.999]  We have a responsibility to do that.
[01:11:14.999 --> 01:11:23.485]  But take our probiotics that have hundreds and hundreds of five-star reviews on outside third-party sites like Power Reviews.
[01:11:23.485 --> 01:11:27.508]  They got a Federal Trade Commission complaint, which is a joke.
[01:11:27.508 --> 01:11:28.729]  They laughed at it, sent a letter back.
[01:11:29.369 --> 01:11:33.512]  Saying, this ought to all be fake, because he's got the best reviews on your site.
[01:11:33.512 --> 01:11:39.936]  They're like, no, actually we cut out the ones that are too positive to follow FDA rules.
[01:11:39.936 --> 01:11:43.919]  I mean, that's, we could go get reviews from 20 places and show you the same stuff.
[01:11:43.919 --> 01:11:45.940]  It's our listeners, they're buying it, they love it.
[01:11:45.940 --> 01:11:47.861]  Biome Defense is a great probiotic.
[01:11:47.861 --> 01:11:57.248]  Probiotics is my right to take good cultures of bacteria, whether I got it from sauerkraut or Biome Defense or whatever, or yogurt,
[01:11:58.533 --> 01:12:00.475]  That's not even debated.
[01:12:00.475 --> 01:12:04.178]  It's not even debated that if you have iodine deficiencies, you'll die.
[01:12:04.178 --> 01:12:07.460]  Now, here's the latest article.
[01:12:07.460 --> 01:12:10.142]  I was set in group up last week to talk about this.
[01:12:10.142 --> 01:12:13.965]  Today, a huge Vox report, 10 pages long.
[01:12:13.965 --> 01:12:16.107]  I watched Alex Jones give his viewers health advice.
[01:12:16.107 --> 01:12:16.928]  No, I didn't.
[01:12:16.928 --> 01:12:18.049]  I'm a citizen.
[01:12:18.049 --> 01:12:19.350]  I can give you my opinion.
[01:12:19.350 --> 01:12:20.991]  I can read news articles if I want.
[01:12:20.991 --> 01:12:23.093]  But this is all tailored to, again, try to get
[01:12:24.244 --> 01:12:25.265]  The FDA after me.
[01:12:25.265 --> 01:12:26.385]  They're coming on every front.
[01:12:26.385 --> 01:12:26.745]  Good!
[01:12:26.745 --> 01:12:30.648]  That just means I'm telling the truth and taking action.
[01:12:30.648 --> 01:12:32.509]  Because look at this.
[01:12:32.509 --> 01:12:40.213]  Then you learn it's not even me giving advice, it's Dr. Group on breaking down major studies.
[01:12:40.213 --> 01:12:48.438]  So, there are more and more antifungal and anti-candida, basically, in the same class as probiotics.
[01:12:48.438 --> 01:12:50.980]  I mean, you go to Whole Foods and they're selling stuff similar to what we've got.
[01:12:52.165 --> 01:13:01.288]  This is totally normal, because you lose the good bacteria because of pesticides in your gut, or antibiotics, or whatever the case may be, then the bad stuff, the yeast and all of it moves in.
[01:13:01.288 --> 01:13:03.109]  That's all over mainstream news!
[01:13:03.109 --> 01:13:05.009]  That's all over everywhere!
[01:13:05.009 --> 01:13:07.750]  I don't think that's even debated.
[01:13:07.750 --> 01:13:10.731]  But they say, I invented this.
[01:13:10.731 --> 01:13:16.693]  We invented probiotics, and we invented antifungals in the intestines.
[01:13:16.693 --> 01:13:20.915]  Ladies and gentlemen, 10 pages of the craziest bull I've ever read.
[01:13:23.897 --> 01:13:25.978]  Everything we sell is FDA grass.
[01:13:25.978 --> 01:13:28.598]  That's the law that means it's seen as safe.
[01:13:28.598 --> 01:13:33.740]  We have the biggest companies making it, the top labs testing it all, because we know we're a target.
[01:13:33.740 --> 01:13:36.301]  And we follow things to a ridiculous level.
[01:13:36.301 --> 01:13:38.221]  You hear everybody else making claims out there.
[01:13:38.221 --> 01:13:41.742]  We don't.
[01:13:41.742 --> 01:13:47.264]  I can tell you what X2 and all this has done for me, but this is what they're doing.
[01:13:47.264 --> 01:13:51.465]  They say I'm the worst person on earth, worse than Dr. Oz, worse than everybody.
[01:13:51.465 --> 01:13:52.126]  I'm insane.
[01:13:54.463 --> 01:13:58.704]  Autism isn't on the rise.
[01:13:58.704 --> 01:14:07.547]  They also say I'm crazy and that HPV hasn't been linked to deaths all over the world and been banned in places like India and Japan.
[01:14:07.547 --> 01:14:12.229]  I mean, I see mainstream news articles every day where people are getting paralyzed and dying from Gardasil.
[01:14:12.229 --> 01:14:18.130]  They approved it here in Texas to make everybody else accept it through an emergency law Rick Perry put through ten years ago.
[01:14:18.130 --> 01:14:19.391]  I remember all the deaths.
[01:14:20.416 --> 01:14:22.757]  Even the local newspapers were saying it was horrible.
[01:14:22.757 --> 01:14:24.297]  But you read this, man.
[01:14:24.297 --> 01:14:30.359]  You read this, and you'd think Gardasil doesn't even have any side effects.
[01:14:30.359 --> 01:14:36.040]  And they say, Jones sits up there like he's a doctor, and says, Gardasil does this, and this does that.
[01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:40.921]  No, I said my grandmother got polio from the polio vaccine, and her MD told her that.
[01:14:40.921 --> 01:14:43.682]  They go, oh, get your second round, another strain.
[01:14:43.682 --> 01:14:45.883]  She got it a week later.
[01:14:45.883 --> 01:14:47.003]  It ruined much of her life.
[01:14:48.581 --> 01:14:50.122]  My mother almost died from a flu shot.
[01:14:50.122 --> 01:14:51.424]  We all have these stories.
[01:14:51.424 --> 01:14:52.064]  We all know.
[01:14:52.064 --> 01:14:53.686]  We know what the insert says.
[01:14:53.686 --> 01:14:56.629]  But they look at us like we're crazy.
[01:14:56.629 --> 01:15:04.296]  So Dr. Groups here wasn't going to come on about iodine and why it's so important and where we get it and why we're starting to run into some problems.
[01:15:04.296 --> 01:15:07.999]  I'm not going to say that's what this is, but it's from every angle, which is fine.
[01:15:07.999 --> 01:15:09.040]  I expected this.
[01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:09.401]  I knew this.
[01:15:09.401 --> 01:15:10.101]  We're changing the world.
[01:15:10.922 --> 01:15:12.203]  And you know, sometimes I get a little angry.
[01:15:12.203 --> 01:15:15.766]  I say things sometimes, you know, that I didn't mean to say, you know, out of turn, whatever.
[01:15:15.766 --> 01:15:17.487]  The point is, my heart's good.
[01:15:17.487 --> 01:15:20.349]  And we're trying to turn the world around and trying to not have World War III.
[01:15:20.349 --> 01:15:22.511]  Because I got children, so does Dr. Gripp.
[01:15:22.511 --> 01:15:24.732]  Dr. Gripp, we got this short segment, another segment.
[01:15:24.732 --> 01:15:29.756]  Getting into this today, I know you sent me a lot of news articles, new big studies out about iodine, all of it.
[01:15:29.756 --> 01:15:32.418]  But just separately, what do you make of this new thing?
[01:15:32.418 --> 01:15:39.103]  I don't know if you've seen this, where, where we're, probiotics, did you know we just made that up, Dr. Gripp?
[01:15:40.543 --> 01:15:47.508]  Yeah, the good thing about that, even though they're coming out with all these articles, they're just trying to attack us on every single level right now.
[01:15:47.508 --> 01:15:49.390]  I read that Vox article as well.
[01:15:49.390 --> 01:16:00.278]  I mean, the fact of the matter is, the definition of an epidemic is a widespread occurrence of any infectious disease at any community at any particular time.
[01:16:00.798 --> 01:16:10.644]  You can go on Google, you can look at PubMed Studies, you can look, I mean, we're not going to get on the air and talk about stuff that we don't know 100% is right.
[01:16:10.644 --> 01:16:24.772]  I mean, the far left, this media attack against the truth is nothing more than just trying to get people to try to believe something that's false.
[01:16:24.772 --> 01:16:27.794]  I mean, it's just, you look at fake news out there, and
[01:16:29.875 --> 01:16:33.758]  It's just amazing that these individuals can come out and talk about all this stuff.
[01:16:33.758 --> 01:16:34.979]  With a straight face!
[01:16:34.979 --> 01:16:40.423]  They attack our probiotic and say, we've invented something for something that doesn't exist!
[01:16:40.423 --> 01:16:43.485]  Probiotics is the fastest growing industry in the country!
[01:16:43.485 --> 01:16:47.067]  Yeah, what happened to real journalism out there?
[01:16:47.067 --> 01:16:48.989]  I mean, anybody can take...
[01:16:49.409 --> 01:17:04.641]  What we say on the air, and anybody can take the information in that article and go look, type in Candida, type in fungus among us, type in mold problems, type in all this stuff, and they're gonna see that what we're doing is we're actually telling the truth.
[01:17:04.641 --> 01:17:11.367]  And I think that they, you know, when you have an article or something come out like that, they just know that it's truth.
[01:17:11.367 --> 01:17:17.332]  I mean, they know that it's truth, and that's why they're trying to counteract it and trying to say that it's not true.
[01:17:17.332 --> 01:17:17.952]  Let me tell you a story.
[01:17:19.373 --> 01:17:26.823]  I know three people in this building that told me they had irritable bowel and all sorts of problems, and I said, take them every day.
[01:17:26.823 --> 01:17:31.710]  All three came back to me in the last six months and said, totally normal now, my life totally changed.
[01:17:31.710 --> 01:17:32.411]  I mean, it's incredible.
[01:17:32.912 --> 01:17:36.414]  Because the medical profession has not taught the doctors about gut health.
[01:17:36.414 --> 01:17:57.447]  Even when we were coming out with our studies 20 years ago and we interviewed a hundred gastroenterologists around the country and asked them how important are probiotics, how important is gut health in the creation of disease, our research is showing that the accumulation of toxins in the body and in the gut is causing leaky gut syndrome, is causing malfunctions.
[01:17:57.447 --> 01:17:58.168]  We're having gut
[01:17:58.368 --> 01:17:59.089]  Crises!
[01:17:59.089 --> 01:18:04.134]  I mean, Crohn's disease 50 years ago was unknown, now it's everywhere!
[01:18:04.134 --> 01:18:13.123]  Right, and they were telling us 15 years ago, oh that doesn't make any difference, oh you can eat what you want, organic food doesn't make a difference, oh there's no such thing as chemicals.
[01:18:13.123 --> 01:18:18.028]  Oh let me ask you this, what do you make of how it's mainly liberals going crazy?
[01:18:18.028 --> 01:18:21.091]  When it's liberals and one of the areas they're actually informed on is probiotics.
[01:18:23.257 --> 01:18:42.582]  They're just, I mean, I don't know, it's a mass consciousness shift with liberals, I guess, because across the board politically, you know, with the geoengineering chemtrail thing, which they still say doesn't, chemtrails don't exist when you can pull up the patents and the geoengineering documents and the government approving 80
[01:18:44.262 --> 01:18:49.030]  Billion tons to be sprayed in the air of aluminum oxide nanoparticles.
[01:18:49.030 --> 01:18:53.356]  I mean, it's all there right in front of your face if you can pull it up.
[01:18:54.457 --> 01:19:06.428]  And Bonsanto, and all of a sudden genetically modified foods are going to be the savior of the planet, and we're all going to be able to have healthy genetically modified foods to eat.
[01:19:06.428 --> 01:19:08.750]  It's just running rampant right now.
[01:19:08.750 --> 01:19:19.480]  Look at what's happening with Gorsuch, who's a great qualified person probably to be in the Supreme Court, and they're just attacking everything, attacking everything, attacking everything.
[01:19:20.681 --> 01:19:34.120]  When you look back, obviously, and you look at the design of all what the earth has had to go through, and look at the healthcare system that we're currently suffering from, the great news, Alex, is people are waking up and they're not believing.
[01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:34.500]  They are.
[01:19:34.500 --> 01:19:35.342]  So what we're seeing is...
[01:19:36.703 --> 01:19:37.403]  It's death row.
[01:19:37.403 --> 01:19:39.044]  That's why we've got to be peaceful.
[01:19:39.044 --> 01:19:47.646]  Even when they provocate and say they want to kill us and say we're Russian spies and say they want to kill Trump, sometimes we get angry and we say, OK, I'll punch you or whatever.
[01:19:47.646 --> 01:19:52.268]  No, we've got to be like Gandhi, as I've always preached, because they're so violent and hateful now.
[01:19:52.268 --> 01:19:55.249]  I catch myself slipping up and adding to it.
[01:19:55.249 --> 01:19:59.870]  We've got to de-escalate things and just try to have cooler heads prevail.
[01:20:01.101 --> 01:20:02.202]  Think about this.
[01:20:02.202 --> 01:20:14.712]  Your community's aging water infrastructure systems are very likely to be contaminated with heavy metals like lead, disinfection chemicals like ammonia, chlorine, and chloramines, and pharmaceuticals like statins, pain meds, and antidepressants.
[01:20:14.712 --> 01:20:18.956]  And no, water treatment plants are not equipped to filter these pharmaceutical toxins out.
[01:20:18.956 --> 01:20:22.759]  Protect your family's water supply with a trusted Big Berkey Water Filter.

[01:22:00.587 --> 01:22:02.389]  Hi, my name's John Kunkel.
[01:22:02.389 --> 01:22:03.650]  I'm 63 years of age.
[01:22:03.650 --> 01:22:09.535]  I've watched several YouTube videos of Stephen Heuers and learned what supplements might help me with energy and weight loss.
[01:22:09.535 --> 01:22:16.101]  I've now been on the Andreas Black Cumin Seed Oil, Synergy One, and 600 products from Synergistic Nutrition for several weeks now.
[01:22:16.101 --> 01:22:17.642]  I've lost 10 pounds.
[01:22:17.642 --> 01:22:19.604]  My joint pain has been reduced significantly.
[01:22:19.804 --> 01:22:22.506]  I have a lot of energy that I've never had before.
[01:22:22.506 --> 01:22:25.367]  My cravings for sweets are gone, and I'm rarely hungry.
[01:22:25.367 --> 01:22:29.330]  Even my cravings for foods like hamburgers and heavy carbohydrate meals are now gone.
[01:22:29.330 --> 01:22:31.071]  This is the only thing that's worked for me.
[01:22:31.071 --> 01:22:34.873]  I was seriously considering bariatric surgery, but that's out the window now.
[01:22:34.873 --> 01:22:36.874]  Thank you so much, Synergistic Nutrition.

[01:23:32.551 --> 01:23:39.013]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries.
[01:23:39.013 --> 01:23:42.374]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetics.
[01:23:42.374 --> 01:23:44.414]  So the body is an amazing thing.
[01:23:44.414 --> 01:23:47.375]  It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.
[01:23:47.535 --> 01:23:49.996]  Heart and Body Extract gets results.

[01:24:06.499 --> 01:24:11.981]  I mean, I gotta tell you, they have no creativity with these lies.
[01:24:11.981 --> 01:24:13.681]  They just invert things.
[01:24:15.097 --> 01:24:34.140]  We go to the biggest, most respected labs in the country and produce probiotics and antifungals that I know for a fact they've got big fancy labs here in Austin where rich people go and pay four or five times for basically the same stuff for the antifungals and they just absolutely live by it.
[01:24:35.290 --> 01:24:42.394]  What getting Candida and all this out does, and then we sell a high-quality brand of it and we're the devil.
[01:24:42.394 --> 01:24:46.336]  I mean, everything we sell is established.
[01:24:46.336 --> 01:24:48.477]  Totally established.
[01:24:48.477 --> 01:24:53.699]  A lot of our stuff is just private labeled famous brands.
[01:24:53.699 --> 01:24:57.241]  You know, our toothpaste gets made by the biggest group that puts out fluoride-free toothpaste.
[01:24:57.241 --> 01:25:00.223]  We just add iodine and colloidal silver to it.
[01:25:01.178 --> 01:25:05.101]  And it's just, you sit there and you watch the attacks, but we've got a few minutes left on the group.
[01:25:05.101 --> 01:25:13.788]  You really wanted to come on about all the iodine news, some of the new studies that are out, but also we've talked some about this, mainly over email.
[01:25:13.788 --> 01:25:17.791]  Do you think we're going to be able to continue, at least from this source, to be able to get this iodine from the deep earth?
[01:25:19.181 --> 01:25:21.982]  Right now, iodine is in the news everywhere.
[01:25:21.982 --> 01:25:33.267]  Israel just finished their huge national survey on iodine deficiency because they're having so many people over there come down, babies with mental retardation, thyroid issues.
[01:25:33.267 --> 01:25:40.230]  It's happening all over the world, so the demand for iodine is increasing at a pretty exponential rate.
[01:25:40.230 --> 01:25:48.413]  The study in Israel just showed that 62% of school-aged children, 85% of pregnant women have low iodine intakes.
[01:25:48.473 --> 01:25:51.836]  Folks ask why my children glow, literally.
[01:25:51.836 --> 01:25:54.079]  And they just go, they're glowing, what's going on?
[01:25:54.079 --> 01:25:55.881]  And I go, iodine.
[01:25:55.881 --> 01:25:57.903]  But it's not the crap iodine, that stuff will kill you.
[01:25:57.903 --> 01:25:59.745]  Explain why X2 is so special.
[01:26:00.442 --> 01:26:07.366]  Right, so iodine in nature is I2, and it has two iodines stuck together, and it's very caustic.
[01:26:07.366 --> 01:26:09.107]  You can't take that in your mouth.
[01:26:09.107 --> 01:26:13.630]  If you just take pure iodine crystals, you'll start to see that purple smoke come off of it.
[01:26:13.630 --> 01:26:16.291]  So it's a very oxidating substance.
[01:26:16.291 --> 01:26:21.054]  So what we have to do is take it through this complete detoxification process.
[01:26:21.054 --> 01:26:21.914]  Which is Russian.
[01:26:21.914 --> 01:26:24.716]  It is a Russian patent, so now we're evil Russians now.
[01:26:27.013 --> 01:26:35.441]  But the key is starting with the raw material and that's, you know, making sure you start with a pure 99.99% iodine crystals.
[01:26:35.441 --> 01:26:46.951]  US Pharmaceutical or USP or British Pharmacopeia, those are the highest purity standards in the world and you have to have 99.7% or higher purity.
[01:26:46.951 --> 01:26:52.496]  And you have to have a DEA license because this can be, in its raw form, used for so much stuff.
[01:26:53.340 --> 01:26:53.740]  Right.
[01:26:53.740 --> 01:27:00.881]  I mean, iodine crystals are used to produce crystal meth, and so you really have to, the DEA, you know, follows this very closely.
[01:27:00.881 --> 01:27:02.842]  We have to have strict procedures.
[01:27:02.842 --> 01:27:08.223]  But I mean, it's, you know, you follow it back like you were talking about, you know, the fungus thing and the articles.
[01:27:08.223 --> 01:27:13.424]  You look at why we're dealing with that and why they're trying to be quiet about it, just with iodine, okay?
[01:27:13.424 --> 01:27:15.964]  There's always some sinister plan behind it.
[01:27:15.964 --> 01:27:19.044]  Let's take out iodine from everywhere.
[01:27:19.044 --> 01:27:21.805]  We know what it's going to cause when people become iodine deficient.
[01:27:22.105 --> 01:27:23.746]  Let's replace it with bromine.
[01:27:23.746 --> 01:27:25.307]  Let's put fluoride in the water.
[01:27:25.307 --> 01:27:31.090]  We know all the different halogens that are going to cause people to become sick and become controllable.
[01:27:31.090 --> 01:27:33.351]  Because again, this is a fact I'm stating.
[01:27:33.351 --> 01:27:36.333]  I mean, I'm not a rocket scientist, but I can read a report on a rocket.
[01:27:36.333 --> 01:27:41.436]  Your thyroid and other glands will absorb the bad and use it if it doesn't have the good, and then that's it.
[01:27:41.436 --> 01:27:44.137]  Take the good halogen out, put the bad halogen in.
[01:27:44.137 --> 01:27:47.339]  The federal government, what, until the 70s mandated iodine in the salt.
[01:27:48.973 --> 01:27:49.633]  That's right.
[01:27:49.633 --> 01:27:50.054]  That's right.
[01:27:50.054 --> 01:27:52.995]  So there's always a cause, even with the candida and the fungus thing.
[01:27:52.995 --> 01:27:54.936]  Look at high fructose corn syrup.
[01:27:54.936 --> 01:27:58.477]  Look at all the chemicals in the food and the beverages that they're promoting.
[01:27:58.477 --> 01:27:59.958]  What do those things do?
[01:27:59.958 --> 01:28:03.119]  They cause an increase of fungus.
[01:28:03.119 --> 01:28:04.780]  And everything starts from the gut.
[01:28:04.780 --> 01:28:08.122]  You know, if you heal the gut, then everything else starts to follow in.
[01:28:09.182 --> 01:28:13.848]  Another, there's a lot of new discoveries coming out too as far as iodine is concerned.
[01:28:13.848 --> 01:28:22.297]  MIT just came out with a new study that they're going to be using iodine possibly in batteries to extend the life of batteries.
[01:28:22.297 --> 01:28:23.339]  Iodine deficiency,
[01:28:24.780 --> 01:28:27.642]  It's affecting 11 million children across the world.
[01:28:27.642 --> 01:28:40.889]  It was a new study that just came out by Dr. The Pediatrics Dean at a child specialist facility and they're linking iodine deficiency and brain damage to 43 million people now.
[01:28:40.889 --> 01:28:44.972]  So I mean, Alex, these are all the things that we identify years and years.
[01:28:45.572 --> 01:28:52.537]  Putting mainstream news articles up, and if you look at Pharmakeia, and they're all getting into iodine, suddenly there's all these iodines on the shelves.
[01:28:52.537 --> 01:28:55.079]  We go in and look, it's all a bunch of crud stuff.
[01:28:55.079 --> 01:29:00.182]  I mean, it's just crazy that we are literally the only group putting the pure stuff out.
[01:29:00.182 --> 01:29:01.023]  It's just, it's unbelievable.
[01:29:01.636 --> 01:29:23.406]  Yeah, and there are surveys and reports that have come out in the last probably three weeks that do show that there is a supply issue with iodine and we don't know because we're digging so deep into the earth if that supply is going to run out tomorrow or if it's going to run out, you know, whenever it's going to run out.
[01:29:23.406 --> 01:29:25.867]  Well, the point I've heard is that there's a run on it everywhere.
[01:29:25.867 --> 01:29:27.228]  Prices are going up, it's harder to get.
[01:29:28.393 --> 01:29:30.194]  That's, that's, that is what's happening.
[01:29:30.194 --> 01:29:38.497]  You know, we've got a good supply stocked away just for emergency purposes and just to make sure InfoWars is going to have a good supply of the X2.
[01:29:38.497 --> 01:29:40.478]  But, you know, you never know what's going to happen.
[01:29:40.478 --> 01:29:44.659]  The thing is, just make sure that you're taking all the supplements and make sure you're keeping your body healthy.
[01:29:44.659 --> 01:29:46.300]  And you support the broadcast at the same time.
[01:29:46.300 --> 01:29:48.261]  It's like, yeah, absolutely.
[01:29:48.261 --> 01:29:48.941]  Band-Aids.
[01:29:48.941 --> 01:29:50.321]  We didn't invent cuts.
[01:29:50.321 --> 01:29:52.362]  We're talking about things everybody needs.
[01:29:52.362 --> 01:29:53.122]  Thank you, Dr. Grip.
[01:29:53.122 --> 01:29:54.223]  Amazing job.
[01:29:54.223 --> 01:29:56.904]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.365 --> 01:30:06.468]  While the swamp is competitive in the political battle, it does seem the cultural swamp is being drained.
[01:30:06.468 --> 01:30:11.991]  Shia LaBeouf's most recent film, Man Down, had a blockbuster opening day with a huge ticket sale.
[01:30:11.991 --> 01:30:13.312]  Yes, one ticket.
[01:30:13.312 --> 01:30:17.114]  Since opening night last weekend, ticket sales have totaled a whopping three.
[01:30:17.114 --> 01:30:19.436]  He's had more flags stolen than ticket sales.
[01:30:19.436 --> 01:30:23.898]  So Shia's childish antics on the streets earned him more attention than his actual job.
[01:30:23.898 --> 01:30:28.381]  Meanwhile, InStyle Magazine had to publish a story to boost Amy Schumer's crushed ego,
[01:30:28.601 --> 01:30:33.106]  Headline reading, dudes, Amy Schumer is not too vulgar, you're just sexist.
[01:30:33.106 --> 01:30:36.570]  So now, if a man doesn't like a woman, it's because he's sexist.
[01:30:36.570 --> 01:30:41.997]  How dare you not like my strong, proud woman who breaks all the social paradigms by trying to be elegant and abhorrent at the same time.
[01:30:41.997 --> 01:30:42.277]  See?
[01:30:42.277 --> 01:30:43.699]  Women can do and be anything.
[01:30:43.959 --> 01:30:45.581]  Yes, including two vulgar.
[01:30:45.581 --> 01:30:50.188]  I ran a series of polls on Twitter called Who's the Worst, and Amy Schumer won!
[01:30:50.188 --> 01:30:51.470]  The people have spoken.
[01:30:51.470 --> 01:30:52.852]  Amy Schumer is the worst.
[01:30:52.852 --> 01:30:55.996]  But if the left wants her to be their poster child, go ahead.
[01:30:55.996 --> 01:30:57.779]  We will keep winning the culture war.
[01:30:57.779 --> 01:31:00.142]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroyer.

[01:32:00.851 --> 01:32:07.416]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[01:32:07.416 --> 01:32:10.618]  Dr. Grip, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[01:32:10.618 --> 01:32:16.222]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[01:32:16.222 --> 01:32:22.346]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[01:32:22.346 --> 01:32:25.609]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[01:32:25.609 --> 01:32:27.070]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[01:32:27.270 --> 01:32:31.572]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[01:32:31.572 --> 01:32:34.514]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[01:32:34.514 --> 01:32:36.195]  It works like an antioxidant.
[01:32:36.195 --> 01:32:39.617]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[01:32:39.617 --> 01:32:42.218]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[01:32:42.218 --> 01:32:43.299]  It's in powder form.
[01:32:43.299 --> 01:32:46.160]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[01:32:46.160 --> 01:32:46.881]  I take this.
[01:32:46.881 --> 01:32:48.682]  This is the product that I take.
[01:32:48.682 --> 01:32:50.663]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[01:32:51.483 --> 01:32:52.284]  We fight the Globals.
[01:32:52.284 --> 01:32:53.405]  We fight the New World Order.

[01:32:58.148 --> 01:33:17.503]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[01:33:17.503 --> 01:33:19.364]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:28.722 --> 01:33:31.685]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are living again in unprecedented times.
[01:33:31.685 --> 01:33:54.464]  I want to open the phones up for listeners about the Russia situation, the Syria situation, the ties to Russia, China openly threatening to attack us with nuclear weapons, North Korea doing it, and then Trump just says we'll have to stand up against that, and our leftist media calls him the problem, says it's all because of him, and Syria is because of him, and Obamacare is because of him.
[01:33:55.603 --> 01:34:06.214]  And everything else, I saw Chuckie Schumer about an hour ago giving a press conference saying Trump's like a 98-pound, you know, child up against a man with China.
[01:34:06.214 --> 01:34:12.400]  These are such un-American people that are rooting for our stock market to fall.
[01:34:12.400 --> 01:34:12.961]  There's the quote.
[01:34:12.961 --> 01:34:15.624]  Schumer, Trump looks like a 98-pound weakling.
[01:34:15.624 --> 01:34:16.725]  Grab that clip for me if you can.
[01:34:19.981 --> 01:34:28.452]  The servile hatred and the way they get liberals to hate America and to root for their own impoverishment and their own enslavement.
[01:34:29.830 --> 01:34:33.831]  It's the craziest Stockholm Syndrome garbage I've ever seen.
[01:34:33.831 --> 01:34:35.912]  I want to take your calls.
[01:34:35.912 --> 01:34:36.672]  800-259-9231.
[01:34:36.672 --> 01:34:39.153]  800-259-9231.
[01:34:39.153 --> 01:34:45.195]  I apologize sometimes we don't go to your calls by the time another guest comes on and so I leave you on hold.
[01:34:45.195 --> 01:34:48.656]  I'll try to hang up on you or at least let you know that we can't go to you if I don't get to everybody.
[01:34:48.656 --> 01:34:50.856]  But I'm trying to go to your calls here in just a moment at 800-259-9231.
[01:34:50.856 --> 01:34:53.117]  But this is cruising for war with the situation in Syria.
[01:35:00.452 --> 01:35:06.133]  The Russians are saying they're there with a legitimate government and aren't going to back down unless Trump, quote, gives them a plan.
[01:35:06.133 --> 01:35:11.775]  Russia challenges Trump to say what they should do.
[01:35:11.775 --> 01:35:19.456]  But Trump won't even talk to Russia now because the media has gotten him isolated and his advisors isolated on purpose.
[01:35:19.456 --> 01:35:23.077]  They set Trump up to where now he can't even talk to Russia.
[01:35:23.077 --> 01:35:28.859]  The President and the head of the House Intelligence Committee can't even come over and view classified material at the White House.
[01:35:28.859 --> 01:35:29.959]  That's totally normal.
[01:35:34.244 --> 01:35:38.248]  The Democratic Party comes in and says, no, you're going to recuse yourself.
[01:35:38.248 --> 01:35:40.310]  We filed ethics complaints on you.
[01:35:40.310 --> 01:35:42.212]  And the Republicans don't file complaints on them.
[01:35:42.212 --> 01:35:50.480]  They just keep taking it and taking it and taking it when the Russians were all in the Democrats' junk.
[01:35:50.480 --> 01:35:52.062]  And they always have been.
[01:35:52.062 --> 01:35:55.205]  And I don't even blame the Russians.
[01:35:55.205 --> 01:35:56.386]  That's what foreign governments do.
[01:35:56.386 --> 01:35:57.948]  You don't think our government isn't doing stuff in Russia?
[01:35:59.847 --> 01:36:01.248]  Globalism is in crisis.
[01:36:01.248 --> 01:36:03.309]  The globalists admit it's in flames.
[01:36:03.309 --> 01:36:05.270]  They admit it's falling apart.
[01:36:05.270 --> 01:36:06.171]  So, what are they going to do?
[01:36:06.171 --> 01:36:07.412]  Your phone calls are coming up.
[01:36:07.412 --> 01:36:21.641]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, former policy head of the Treasury Department, former head editor at the Wall Street Journal, prolific writer, and of course, researcher, paulcraigroberts.org joins us.
[01:36:21.641 --> 01:36:23.942]  I want to get his breakdown on
[01:36:25.461 --> 01:36:32.223]  The talk of nuclear war, even Joel Skousen has upped this to the highest threat ever, saying now it could happen any time.
[01:36:32.223 --> 01:36:34.363]  And who are the power players?
[01:36:34.363 --> 01:36:38.304]  And why are the Western elites so out to get Russia?
[01:36:38.304 --> 01:36:46.866]  And then meanwhile we have John McCain saying yesterday, now Washington is returning to its normal order.
[01:36:47.759 --> 01:36:51.641]  Now that the neocons, I guess, are in charge, and now there's been a good false flag.
[01:36:51.641 --> 01:36:59.925]  Ron Paul has hands down said this is 100% a false flag, because the very same rebels have been caught red-handed at least three times.
[01:36:59.925 --> 01:37:04.848]  Another six, seven, eight times, where even the UN says they're the ones that did it.
[01:37:04.848 --> 01:37:09.330]  So, within minutes, though, CNN says, Trump says, okay, I'm changing my mind.
[01:37:09.330 --> 01:37:13.132]  Rand Paul says, whoa, whoa, whoa, don't back Al-Qaeda and ISIS.
[01:37:13.132 --> 01:37:14.213]  We're backing the wrong people.
[01:37:14.213 --> 01:37:15.453]  This is an incredible moment.
[01:37:15.453 --> 01:37:16.594]  This is how World War starts.
[01:37:18.561 --> 01:37:20.841]  By the way, the news is saying I said Trump should nuke China.
[01:37:20.841 --> 01:37:25.222]  I said if a war starts, the only way to survive is to hit them first.
[01:37:25.222 --> 01:37:28.983]  Once a nuclear war starts, you've got to have total commitment.
[01:37:28.983 --> 01:37:30.504]  I don't want that to happen.
[01:37:30.504 --> 01:37:32.004]  But that's how this stuff builds up.
[01:37:32.004 --> 01:37:34.384]  You can't have a regional war anymore, folks.
[01:37:34.384 --> 01:37:35.945]  This has got to stop.
[01:37:35.945 --> 01:37:37.005]  Now, that's my view.
[01:37:37.005 --> 01:37:43.906]  Of course, he was in the Reagan administration, highly respected, was all part of the whole detente with Russia and getting them to end the Cold War.
[01:37:43.906 --> 01:37:45.407]  And he joins us to break this down.
[01:37:45.407 --> 01:37:46.967]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, thanks for coming on with us.
[01:37:47.867 --> 01:37:49.748]  Hello, Alex.
[01:37:49.748 --> 01:37:50.949]  Well, you heard my little breakdown.
[01:37:50.949 --> 01:37:51.470]  Is that accurate?
[01:37:51.470 --> 01:37:54.031]  And where's all this going?
[01:37:54.031 --> 01:38:00.216]  Well, Alex, the Native Serbs won't give up their ideology of world hegemony.
[01:38:00.216 --> 01:38:01.376]  And Russia's in the way.
[01:38:01.376 --> 01:38:02.537]  China's in the way.
[01:38:02.537 --> 01:38:07.541]  And, of course, in the Middle East, Iran and Syria are in the way.
[01:38:07.541 --> 01:38:14.866]  So that's why these four countries are single out for conflict and accusations.
[01:38:16.079 --> 01:38:20.041]  Because they're in the way of American hegemony over the world.
[01:38:20.041 --> 01:38:22.682]  So that's the basic problem.
[01:38:22.682 --> 01:38:27.064]  I know that you were a very strong supporter of Trump.
[01:38:27.064 --> 01:38:37.048]  I thought that all the promise was with him because he wanted to normalize relations with Russia and he wanted to stop the offshoring of the American jobs.
[01:38:38.086 --> 01:38:41.927]  But I think the establishment has reasserted itself.
[01:38:41.927 --> 01:38:47.968]  You know, they dispensed with Flynn, replaced him with a Russophobic general.
[01:38:47.968 --> 01:38:51.889]  They apparently got rid of Bannon.
[01:38:51.889 --> 01:38:53.189]  And so what's left?
[01:38:53.189 --> 01:39:00.171]  You know, we've got Zionists and crazed generals that talk about wars.
[01:39:00.171 --> 01:39:05.272]  So it looks to me like the situation has been as you described it.
[01:39:07.850 --> 01:39:14.415]  Dr. Paul Kerry Roberts, looking at this situation, Trump means well.
[01:39:14.415 --> 01:39:16.116]  He's got the economy going again a little bit.
[01:39:16.116 --> 01:39:16.756]  You're an expert on that.
[01:39:16.756 --> 01:39:18.157]  We'll talk about that in a moment.
[01:39:18.157 --> 01:39:24.421]  But I notice as soon as he starts capitulating, Schumer calls him a 98-pound weakling, throws him out of the bus to China.
[01:39:25.486 --> 01:39:28.668]  Well, Alex, they don't need his head on a spike if he surrenders to them.
[01:39:48.072 --> 01:39:57.238]  And I can't say exactly what he is doing, but it does, to me, look like surrender.
[01:39:57.238 --> 01:40:00.800]  I don't think that he's in a position to fight.
[01:40:00.800 --> 01:40:14.489]  You may remember when we discussed all this a while back, I said his main weakness would be he doesn't know the players, he doesn't know who to appoint in order to take on the establishment that he is committed to taking on.
[01:40:15.530 --> 01:40:19.973]  And therefore I thought his chances weren't all that great.
[01:40:19.973 --> 01:40:22.635]  But they're still better than zero.
[01:40:22.635 --> 01:40:26.317]  And that's the reason I thought he'd be the best candidate.
[01:40:26.317 --> 01:40:30.200]  But it looks like the President is simply the enlist.
[01:40:30.200 --> 01:40:34.662]  He's been the leader of a political movement for some time.
[01:40:34.662 --> 01:40:35.823]  He knows the players.
[01:40:35.823 --> 01:40:36.764]  He knows the issues.
[01:40:36.764 --> 01:40:38.105]  He knows who's going to back him.
[01:40:38.105 --> 01:40:40.987]  He knows what the problem people are and who they are.
[01:40:41.887 --> 01:40:52.955]  It's very difficult for democracy to bring about changes because the deep state is there, it's well established, it's more than half a century old.
[01:40:52.955 --> 01:41:02.702]  The lobbies in Washington are well established, they're well connected to the House, the Senate, to all the executive agencies and to the courts.
[01:41:02.702 --> 01:41:06.505]  So a new president comes in, he's inexperienced,
[01:41:07.606 --> 01:41:13.355]  Tough guy, but inexperienced, and he finds out he's just out flying everywhere.
[01:41:13.355 --> 01:41:15.117]  So I think that's what's happened to him.
[01:41:15.117 --> 01:41:21.828]  I think the Trump agenda is, well the part that I supported, and I think the part you supported,
[01:41:26.367 --> 01:41:31.030]  I don't think we're going to see that.
[01:41:31.030 --> 01:41:49.963]  And the danger of all this demonization of Russia is that it convinces the Russian government that the United States and the European countries are preparing their populations for war with Russia.
[01:41:49.963 --> 01:41:52.905]  You have to remember during the whole Cold War period,
[01:41:54.293 --> 01:42:10.455]  The American presidents worked closely with the Soviet leaders to reduce the tensions because both sides received numerous false warnings of missile attack of incoming ICBMs.
[01:42:12.298 --> 01:42:16.821]  They would never believe because both sides are working together to reduce tensions.
[01:42:16.821 --> 01:42:32.513]  But if you're sitting over there now in Putin's shoes, and you've been demonized up and down the railway track, and Russia's demonized and made all these false accusations, and you get a report of incoming missiles
[01:42:34.352 --> 01:42:38.336]  And you've got five minutes warning time, you're more inclined to believe it.
[01:42:38.336 --> 01:42:45.482]  And so the risk of war, just from accident now, is extremely high.
[01:42:45.482 --> 01:42:49.065]  And that is the new part in this equation.
[01:42:49.065 --> 01:42:53.969]  You know, more or less, we're convincing the Russians that we are preparing
[01:42:54.890 --> 01:42:56.831]  A preemptive nuclear strike.
[01:42:56.831 --> 01:43:00.274]  We've got anti-ballistic missile bases going on their borders.
[01:43:00.274 --> 01:43:01.574]  Well, sure, let's expand on that.
[01:43:01.574 --> 01:43:05.657]  I mean, it was Bush in his last few years said, oh, we have a new doctrine, first strike.
[01:43:05.657 --> 01:43:06.638]  We'll strike you first.
[01:43:06.638 --> 01:43:11.501]  Well, then China and Russia said that they have first strike as well.
[01:43:11.501 --> 01:43:17.805]  So, again, why the insane escalation by the neocons and why are they so hard to keep out of power?
[01:43:22.102 --> 01:43:28.688]  The reason is Russia can block American unilateralism.
[01:43:28.688 --> 01:43:30.369]  So can China.
[01:43:30.369 --> 01:43:44.701]  And the neoconservative doctrine, Alex, is that the United States is the unipower and cannot permit the rise of any other country that could block American unilateral action.
[01:43:44.701 --> 01:43:47.143]  Well, both countries have been able to do that.
[01:43:48.917 --> 01:44:01.688]  The neocons didn't expect the quick return of Russia to power, and they didn't expect the quick rise of China, but they were focused on their Middle Eastern wars there for a decade.
[01:44:02.813 --> 01:44:23.518]  While China beat by far the predictions of when they would be a major force, and during the period when Putin, who was initially seen as the protege of Yeltsin, who would continue under Washington's thumb, just like Yeltsin, instead he was able to recreate Russia as a power.
[01:44:25.376 --> 01:44:38.450]  When they were faced with, hey, look, we've now got two countries that are capable of blocking us from unilateral action, they turned on both countries.
[01:44:38.450 --> 01:44:41.353]  And they're trying to destabilize them.
[01:44:41.353 --> 01:44:42.093]  That's what the
[01:44:43.314 --> 01:45:04.525]  The Ukrainian coup is about, and all of this propaganda, they're trying to threaten them into accepting some form of American vassalage so that the Russians can be negotiated out of blocking American unilateralism.
[01:45:05.645 --> 01:45:11.312]  Well, as you noted, there's a lot of risk there.
[01:45:11.312 --> 01:45:20.684]  And when you convince a thermonuclear power that you're setting them up for a preemptive nuclear attack, you can't expect them just to sit there and wait for it.
[01:45:21.605 --> 01:45:26.190]  And you see from Putin all kinds of pleas.
[01:45:26.190 --> 01:45:33.497]  He has these meetings with an extensive number of Western journalists and says, how do I get through to you?
[01:45:33.497 --> 01:45:35.318]  Don't you understand what's happening?
[01:45:35.318 --> 01:45:38.001]  Don't you understand the risks?
[01:45:38.001 --> 01:45:43.687]  Why do you repeat all of these lies that destroy trust, that build suspicion?
[01:45:44.560 --> 01:45:49.461]  And we also noticed the neocon, neolib media attacks the nationalist movement, America.
[01:45:49.461 --> 01:45:51.741]  They just hate anything independent.
[01:45:51.741 --> 01:45:54.982]  And I see China as a threat, as, you know, communistic and evil.
[01:45:54.982 --> 01:45:58.022]  I don't agree with that.
[01:45:58.022 --> 01:45:59.423]  That's part of their propaganda.
[01:45:59.423 --> 01:46:00.943]  Well, I mean, I've studied what's going on in China.
[01:46:00.943 --> 01:46:01.823]  I know you're a smart guy.
[01:46:01.823 --> 01:46:03.303]  All I'm saying is this.
[01:46:03.303 --> 01:46:06.104]  Our elites help transfer a lot of weapons to China.
[01:46:06.104 --> 01:46:11.665]  And so I'm asking why the elites don't get the reason they're getting checkmated when they're the ones who help give them the weapons.
[01:46:15.002 --> 01:46:19.547]  I don't know to what extent we've transferred weapons to them.
[01:46:19.547 --> 01:46:22.251]  The Russian weapons systems are actually better.
[01:46:22.251 --> 01:46:24.554]  The fighters are better.
[01:46:24.554 --> 01:46:27.898]  I think on the whole, China now has substantial
[01:46:30.625 --> 01:46:38.650]  Sure, of course, that's the big thing.
[01:46:38.650 --> 01:46:39.771]  That's the real power base.
[01:46:39.771 --> 01:46:44.153]  Well, expanding on that, I do see the three different predatory states, not one's good, one's bad.
[01:46:44.153 --> 01:46:51.718]  I do see the whole Anglo-American establishment, obviously, as the big global hegemonic thing that's announced its Pax Americana and its right to rule.
[01:46:51.718 --> 01:46:54.200]  So, obviously, I'm against that happening.
[01:46:54.200 --> 01:46:58.143]  In the few minutes we have left here, the economy, something you're an expert on,
[01:46:58.984 --> 01:47:01.849]  I see Trump racing trying to get jobs back.
[01:47:01.849 --> 01:47:06.960]  I see a lot of the power structure trying to do things to actually curtail that.
[01:47:06.960 --> 01:47:09.284]  Just in a snapshot, where do you think the global economy is right now?
[01:47:11.288 --> 01:47:16.512]  Well, you know, the global economy is a form of colonialism.
[01:47:16.512 --> 01:47:17.813]  It's neo-colonialism.
[01:47:17.813 --> 01:47:23.979]  It's the way the first world continues to exploit the third world.
[01:47:23.979 --> 01:47:38.431]  And now to exploit also its own members like Greece, Portugal, who are forced into massive austerity and this fell off of public assets.
[01:47:39.782 --> 01:47:40.263]  I don't know.
[01:48:00.478 --> 01:48:11.261]  And the 1% or so inbred and decadent, or the one-tenth of 1%, they don't realize the world, according to mainline analysts, is in the most dangerous position it's ever been in.
[01:48:11.261 --> 01:48:11.861]  That's right.
[01:48:11.861 --> 01:48:27.025]  I think it is in a dangerous position because, you know, what's happening is the promise of rising living standards, rising income growth, this is halted.
[01:48:27.025 --> 01:48:29.606]  And not just in the United States, but everywhere.
[01:48:30.908 --> 01:48:31.228]  All right.
[01:48:49.474 --> 01:48:50.074]  Yeah, right.
[01:48:50.074 --> 01:48:52.815]  I mean, that's what globalism is.
[01:49:14.295 --> 01:49:18.077]  You know, we had these hopes for Trump, but I think he's collapsed.
[01:49:18.077 --> 01:49:19.939]  The system was too strong for him.
[01:49:19.939 --> 01:49:20.839]  He's a strong man.
[01:49:20.839 --> 01:49:22.080]  He was independently wealthy.
[01:49:22.080 --> 01:49:24.562]  He didn't need anything.
[01:49:24.562 --> 01:49:30.185]  He had the chance, but I don't think he was able to pull it off.
[01:49:30.185 --> 01:49:36.749]  I don't think that he was with them from the beginning or that he intentionally sold out or anything like that.
[01:49:36.749 --> 01:49:42.013]  I just think the system proved to be too strong for a president.
[01:49:42.013 --> 01:49:42.933]  The swamp drains you.
[01:49:44.094 --> 01:49:52.262]  So, you know, Chris Hedges and some of these people say the only solution is revolution.
[01:49:54.079 --> 01:49:55.520]  I don't really know.
[01:49:55.520 --> 01:50:09.925]  I think, Alex, what is likely to happen is we overreach, we get checkmate, we have some economic crisis the Fed can't control, and there's a form of collapse.
[01:50:09.925 --> 01:50:12.787]  And out of the collapse can come real change.
[01:50:12.787 --> 01:50:13.867]  Maybe that's what happens.
[01:50:13.867 --> 01:50:17.949]  In a way, you have to hope for a collapse if Trump can't fix it and we can't fix it so there's not nuclear war.
[01:50:20.387 --> 01:50:22.389]  We certainly don't want a nuclear war.
[01:50:22.389 --> 01:50:26.873]  The weapons today are so powerful, there just won't be anybody left.
[01:50:26.873 --> 01:50:44.208]  And you have to keep in mind that when the President of Russia says we can no longer trust the Americans, and when the Russians say we'll never again fight a war on our own territory, they're telling you something.
[01:50:44.208 --> 01:50:46.250]  And it's not something you want to push against.
[01:50:47.412 --> 01:51:00.236]  I know, it's crazy, but we got a bunch of neocons that were never even in combat that want nuclear war, so I guess we have to worship them and let them run things and let the folks in the House Intelligence Committee, Mr. Schiff, take us to World War III, because he has to prove he's a big tough guy.
[01:51:00.236 --> 01:51:00.776]  Thank you.
[01:51:00.776 --> 01:51:01.337]  Call's coming up.
[01:51:01.337 --> 01:51:05.978]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook food and boil water.
[01:51:05.978 --> 01:51:11.680]  If your current plan includes using a fuel-burning stove or cooking over an open fire, then there's a much better way.

[01:51:30.771 --> 01:51:35.894]  The answer to being in control of your own health care is freedom from insurance.
[01:51:35.894 --> 01:51:41.597]  Become part of a group of self-pay patients that come together to share in each other's medical expenses.
[01:51:41.597 --> 01:51:46.800]  Individual share amounts begin at $107 a month and $347 for families.
[01:51:46.800 --> 01:51:48.741]  Choose from three health sharing programs.
[01:51:48.741 --> 01:51:51.143]  Holistic treatments may be eligible for sharing.
[01:51:51.143 --> 01:51:52.083]  See guidelines.
[01:51:52.083 --> 01:51:55.365]  Discount programs available for dental, vision, and pharmacy.

[01:52:00.421 --> 01:52:01.522]  Think about this.
[01:52:01.522 --> 01:52:14.033]  Your community's aging water infrastructure systems are very likely to be contaminated with heavy metals like lead, disinfection chemicals like ammonia, chlorine, and chloramines, and pharmaceuticals like statins, pain meds, and antidepressants.
[01:52:14.033 --> 01:52:18.037]  And no, water treatment plants are not equipped to filter these pharmaceutical toxins out.

[01:54:23.670 --> 01:54:26.612]  I agreed with everything Dr. Paul Craig Roberts just said.
[01:54:26.612 --> 01:54:27.372]  I'm about to go to your calls.
[01:54:27.372 --> 01:54:30.854]  I agree with all but one thing.
[01:54:30.854 --> 01:54:33.556]  He said, oh, they just need him to capitulate.
[01:54:33.556 --> 01:54:34.857]  And then they'll leave him alone.
[01:54:34.857 --> 01:54:35.837]  No, they're not going to do that.
[01:54:35.837 --> 01:54:38.199]  They want to destroy the idea of nationalism.
[01:54:38.199 --> 01:54:42.561]  They won't rest until he is dead or indicted or in prison.
[01:54:42.561 --> 01:54:44.342]  Hell, they all say they want him dead.
[01:54:44.342 --> 01:54:45.623]  It's the idea of nationalism.
[01:54:45.623 --> 01:54:49.545]  It's the idea of what he's criticized, their globalism.
[01:54:49.545 --> 01:54:50.346]  They have to do that.
[01:54:51.530 --> 01:54:59.015]  The answer is more nations rising up peacefully, politically and saying no to these bullies and not being part of globalism.
[01:54:59.015 --> 01:55:05.740]  And supporting Trump and communicating to him through Twitter and on the road and everywhere and not letting him be isolated.
[01:55:05.740 --> 01:55:09.583]  So that he understands because here's the deal.
[01:55:09.583 --> 01:55:13.225]  They're never going to stop.
[01:55:13.225 --> 01:55:16.808]  They're never going to stop because they want the total power.
[01:55:18.473 --> 01:55:20.154]  They're totally crazed.
[01:55:20.154 --> 01:55:30.341]  They don't matter how dangerous it is or if it destroys the whole planet because there's still his agenda of jobs and borders and language and all the things the globalists hate.
[01:55:30.341 --> 01:55:36.245]  They're going to now start going after Trump on all that to see if they can bully him into submission.
[01:55:36.245 --> 01:55:37.786]  The Russians say we should have a border!
[01:55:39.144 --> 01:55:39.965]  You can't have one.
[01:55:39.965 --> 01:55:41.567]  I mean, it's basically come down to that.
[01:55:41.567 --> 01:55:46.454]  We should have new elections, they're saying, of all the Republicans, because they were all Russians.
[01:55:46.454 --> 01:55:48.036]  And it's like, excuse me?
[01:55:48.036 --> 01:55:51.261]  Then you scratch the Democrats and it's just Russian connections everywhere?
[01:55:53.550 --> 01:55:58.813]  It's so insulting to have your honor challenged like that, where they have Senate hearings.
[01:55:58.813 --> 01:56:03.555]  And when I was bashing and yelling the other day, I was talking about Schiff as the leader of the whole investigation.
[01:56:03.555 --> 01:56:04.976]  He's not even the bad one.
[01:56:04.976 --> 01:56:11.459]  Literally, it was the other hearings where they had the former head of the Board of Governors on, was his name Armstrong or something?
[01:56:11.459 --> 01:56:14.200]  Going, Alex Jones is run by the Russians.
[01:56:14.200 --> 01:56:18.062]  It's like, how do they sit there and do that when they know it's pure bull?
[01:56:21.721 --> 01:56:27.403]  Nunes' decision to leave a probe on Russia offers fresh start!
[01:56:27.403 --> 01:56:30.825]  And then tomorrow he'll be attacking the other members of the committee saying they've got to go too.
[01:56:30.825 --> 01:56:34.867]  Again, everything he does is about low attention span.
[01:56:34.867 --> 01:56:37.828]  Everything he does is tactical.
[01:56:37.828 --> 01:56:40.889]  And he's been the guy put in there to do it because he was a former U.S.
[01:56:40.889 --> 01:56:43.170]  attorney.
[01:56:43.170 --> 01:56:47.712]  Whose claim to fame, I was looking it up, was somebody getting a bribe from the Russians or something.
[01:56:47.712 --> 01:56:48.752]  It just never ends.
[01:56:53.086 --> 01:56:58.491]  The Deep State doesn't want America to run its own country.
[01:56:58.491 --> 01:56:59.472]  I got Michael Schneider coming up.
[01:56:59.472 --> 01:57:07.899]  I'm going to go to your phone calls right now for a few more segments, then we're going to air Paul Watson's special report, Pedophiles Rule the World, just to understand the type of folks we're dealing with.
[01:57:07.899 --> 01:57:09.641]  All documented cases, all proven.
[01:57:09.641 --> 01:57:10.662]  Get ready.
[01:57:10.662 --> 01:57:12.023]  Pat in Ohio.
[01:57:12.023 --> 01:57:12.643]  Pat, you're on the air.
[01:57:12.643 --> 01:57:13.124]  Thanks for holding.
[01:57:14.614 --> 01:57:16.375]  Uh, yes sir, thank you for taking my call.
[01:57:16.375 --> 01:57:17.175]  Thank you.
[01:57:17.175 --> 01:57:24.519]  I was wondering what it would take to declare victory against globalism, and in the short term, for America.
[01:57:24.519 --> 01:57:33.384]  And also, another quick part to the question is, how do you make people understand there is true evil in the world, and where it comes from?
[01:57:33.384 --> 01:57:33.964]  Say true what?
[01:57:35.630 --> 01:57:37.011]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:57:37.011 --> 01:57:38.652]  Well, look at serial killers.
[01:57:38.652 --> 01:57:42.394]  Look at, you know, look at Stalin and Mao and Hitler and all the rest of it.
[01:57:42.394 --> 01:57:43.174]  They're control freaks.
[01:57:43.174 --> 01:57:45.836]  They're into raw power and into dark energy.
[01:57:45.836 --> 01:57:48.157]  But more of an awakening.
[01:57:48.157 --> 01:57:50.158]  I mean, we've already had such big victories.
[01:57:50.158 --> 01:57:51.419]  People know about the shadow government.
[01:57:51.419 --> 01:57:52.980]  They know about the Federal Reserve being private.
[01:57:52.980 --> 01:57:55.261]  They know about globalism and corporate government.
[01:57:55.261 --> 01:57:56.802]  I mean, it's super unpopular.
[01:57:58.012 --> 01:58:07.860]  They have just gone into total war mode against anybody that tries to be a leader to then be a focal point to lead people to organize a better civilization.
[01:58:07.860 --> 01:58:20.010]  I mean, believe me, I'm attacked second only to Trump, maybe number three after Ben.
[01:58:20.010 --> 01:58:23.093]  And then I get mad at myself when I say things that can take out of context or whatever.
[01:58:23.093 --> 01:58:24.134]  I'm not perfect.
[01:58:24.134 --> 01:58:25.375]  I mean, it's incredibly stressful.
[01:58:25.375 --> 01:58:26.676]  I just do it because it's the right thing to do.
[01:58:28.482 --> 01:58:30.463]  But there's a selfish part of me, too.
[01:58:30.463 --> 01:58:36.444]  I just think, man, could I just get out of here with the family and just get to the southern hemisphere and just let everybody kill each other?
[01:58:36.444 --> 01:58:39.005]  But this war be so big, it'll kill us down there, too.
[01:58:39.005 --> 01:58:41.506]  You just, you gotta stand up against it, folks.
[01:58:41.506 --> 01:58:43.646]  I wish there was some new country to go to.
[01:58:43.646 --> 01:58:45.427]  I wish we could get out of this.
[01:58:45.427 --> 01:58:45.727]  We can't.
[01:58:45.727 --> 01:58:46.567]  We're gonna have to deal with it.
[01:58:46.567 --> 01:58:48.628]  We're gonna have to take our licks, folks.
[01:58:51.323 --> 01:58:55.464]  There was a mighty nation, blessed above all of creation.
[01:58:55.464 --> 01:58:58.265]  Charlie Daniels, he's always loved America.
[01:58:58.265 --> 01:58:59.726]  Let me just read a little thing here.
[01:58:59.726 --> 01:59:04.007]  The American system of justice must be changed to conform to the rest of the world.
[01:59:04.007 --> 01:59:07.789]  Individual rights will have to take a back seat to the collective.
[01:59:07.789 --> 01:59:09.429]  Well, you know what the next move's gonna be, don't you?
[01:59:09.429 --> 01:59:11.050]  They're gonna be coming after you good.
[01:59:11.050 --> 01:59:11.450]  Oh, yeah.
[01:59:11.450 --> 01:59:13.591]  I tell you, it ain't gonna sit well down my way.
[01:59:13.591 --> 01:59:14.211]  At all.
[01:59:14.211 --> 01:59:15.251]  It ain't gonna sit well.
[01:59:15.251 --> 01:59:17.652]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[01:59:17.652 --> 01:59:18.833]  They lost.
[01:59:18.833 --> 01:59:19.493]  We won.
[01:59:20.053 --> 01:59:21.994]  Wanna see what Trump's up against?
[01:59:21.994 --> 01:59:23.155]  It's time to ride, boys.
[01:59:23.155 --> 01:59:25.076]  We need a thousand Paula beers.
[01:59:25.076 --> 01:59:31.140]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom, and apple pie.
[01:59:31.140 --> 01:59:33.482]  And beef was for supper.
[01:59:33.482 --> 01:59:36.083]  Revelation, dawn of global government.
[01:59:36.083 --> 01:59:37.924]  Theatrical screenings on demand.
[01:59:37.924 --> 01:59:39.445]  DVDs now available.
[01:59:39.445 --> 01:59:43.748]  Starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, Special Ops General Jerry Boykin.
[01:59:44.128 --> 01:59:47.471]  Wanna shed some tears over the red, white, and blue?
[01:59:47.471 --> 01:59:53.215]  RevelationsTheMovie.info Let's fix it!
[01:59:53.215 --> 02:00:04.604]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:04.604 --> 02:00:07.187]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:10.638 --> 02:00:17.862]  Well, Stephen Bannon got removed from the National Security Council because he doesn't want to back Al-Qaeda in Syria.
[02:00:17.862 --> 02:00:21.244]  I'm telling you, Rand Paul needs to be the top advisor.
[02:00:34.409 --> 02:00:37.551]  And kind of the champion in the Senate for Trump.
[02:00:37.551 --> 02:00:43.855]  And he just needs to just work with Paul and just Paul has the medical doctor level knowledge of how this works.
[02:00:43.855 --> 02:00:46.917]  I'm really impressed with Rand Paul after four years in the Senate.
[02:00:46.917 --> 02:00:51.039]  Not so much good on the campaign trail, but man, what he knows tactically the right thing to do.
[02:00:51.039 --> 02:00:54.722]  We need, we need Rand Paul drafted into the White House.
[02:00:54.722 --> 02:00:57.223]  That could really turn this around.
[02:00:57.223 --> 02:01:01.566]  I'm just, for all the leftists and globalists that are hoping to see this country go down, you're crazy.
[02:01:01.566 --> 02:01:03.247]  I mean, you're just crazy.
[02:01:04.796 --> 02:01:05.997]  I mean, you want a bad economy?
[02:01:05.997 --> 02:01:06.918]  You want all these wars?
[02:01:06.918 --> 02:01:08.079]  You want to ally with Islam?
[02:01:08.079 --> 02:01:10.621]  I mean, what is your problem, man?
[02:01:10.621 --> 02:01:14.084]  But they got imprinted and trained to hate America.
[02:01:14.084 --> 02:01:17.867]  And I used to hear, like, leftists hated America, and I didn't believe it.
[02:01:17.867 --> 02:01:19.128]  I don't even know what to do anymore.
[02:01:19.128 --> 02:01:21.349]  I'm going to take your calls in the next segment here.
[02:01:21.349 --> 02:01:22.871]  Great point from the last caller.
[02:01:22.871 --> 02:01:25.473]  But you'll be on with us, and the next guest is going to be joining us.
[02:01:25.473 --> 02:01:28.855]  Caller, she'll be popping in while Michael Snyder's on to break all this down.
[02:01:28.855 --> 02:01:33.479]  Nick in California, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:01:33.479 --> 02:01:34.280]  Hey, Nick, how's it going?
[02:01:35.513 --> 02:01:36.034]  Great.
[02:01:36.034 --> 02:01:43.001]  I just wanted to say you hit the nail on the head earlier when you were talking about they're never going to quit.
[02:01:43.001 --> 02:01:52.111]  And when you realize the reason why and you realize why Trump is so powerful is because he's actually acknowledged the power of Jesus Christ in our nation again.
[02:01:52.691 --> 02:01:59.215]  These people are wicked and they're just never going to stop, whether it's Trump or... Look, that's why they hate Russia now and that's why they hate... You just said it.
[02:01:59.215 --> 02:01:59.855]  It's God.
[02:01:59.855 --> 02:02:02.997]  We want to fix things, hit our knees before Christ, ask God for help.
[02:02:02.997 --> 02:02:05.399]  Not the fake churches that are bought off and control most of them.
[02:02:05.399 --> 02:02:06.019]  You're right.
[02:02:06.019 --> 02:02:08.080]  They hate Trump because he acknowledges Christ.
[02:02:08.080 --> 02:02:10.922]  They hate Russia because there's a Christian revival happening there.
[02:02:10.922 --> 02:02:12.082]  They hate Christians.
[02:02:12.082 --> 02:02:12.823]  It's just, it's a fact.
[02:02:14.506 --> 02:02:16.227]  Well, I have to say that we don't all sin.
[02:02:16.227 --> 02:02:21.648]  I mean, we're all grown folks who can really acknowledge, you know, literal facts and true statements.
[02:02:21.648 --> 02:02:25.730]  But we're tied into the real God, the God of life and everything good.
[02:02:25.730 --> 02:02:26.810]  And the enemy, look what they do.
[02:02:26.810 --> 02:02:27.510]  They're tied into evil.
[02:02:27.510 --> 02:02:28.490]  You're absolutely right.
[02:02:28.490 --> 02:02:32.332]  They hate us because they know our hearts are soft, that we love God.
[02:02:32.332 --> 02:02:36.293]  I can come off as really hard and hateful, but it's because I'm thinking about what they're doing to innocent people.
[02:02:36.293 --> 02:02:39.594]  And I do get over-revved and over-angry because it is real.
[02:02:39.594 --> 02:02:42.635]  But God judges the heart, doesn't he?
[02:02:44.006 --> 02:02:59.814]  And I'll tell you what Alex, watching you for many years and seeing you go through your changes and what God has done in your life, personally as I witness you, I pray power into your life and I thank you for being out there on the front line and showing us what it is to struggle and actually keep going forward.
[02:03:00.334 --> 02:03:06.777]  And it wasn't actually until I was able to see Christ for myself in my relationship with my marriage, and then it got better.
[02:03:06.777 --> 02:03:08.038]  And the same thing in politics.
[02:03:08.038 --> 02:03:13.820]  If I get just as angry and bad as these people across the table from me, I ain't doing God any justice.
[02:03:13.820 --> 02:03:19.063]  I'm not bringing... Well, that's what I've been praying to God, is that I not get too angry, because they use it against me, and they take it out of context.
[02:03:19.063 --> 02:03:23.825]  And we need to be strong and focused, and you're absolutely right.
[02:03:23.825 --> 02:03:27.527]  But, you know, I just... The evil is so out in the open now, Nick.
[02:03:30.559 --> 02:03:47.108]  I do believe that it wasn't until I saw myself as someone I should invest something in, you know, through my Christ, but your supplements actually, I heard you on earlier with Dr. Gru, and I take, I start off with my Biome Defense, and then I take my BrainForce.
[02:03:48.188 --> 02:03:51.129]  The Selenium was life-changing.
[02:03:51.129 --> 02:03:53.070]  I'm staring at the oxy.
[02:03:53.070 --> 02:03:55.110]  I still don't know what that does yet.
[02:03:55.110 --> 02:03:57.111]  The B12 is amazing.
[02:03:57.111 --> 02:03:59.511]  The Super Male got me feeling young again.
[02:03:59.511 --> 02:04:00.452]  I don't even work out.
[02:04:00.452 --> 02:04:03.873]  I just came off the knee surgery and your supplements have changed my life.
[02:04:03.873 --> 02:04:08.814]  My wife texted me the first day we got the supplements in that she felt like an 18-year-old that she wanted to dance.
[02:04:08.814 --> 02:04:09.514]  They're real.
[02:04:09.514 --> 02:04:12.835]  Well, I gotta tell you, everything we promote is just missing link.
[02:04:12.835 --> 02:04:13.676]  A lot of it's really simple.
[02:04:13.676 --> 02:04:14.596]  A lot of it's really complex.
[02:04:16.067 --> 02:04:26.836]  Israel, big studies out, now knows massive birth defects, brain damage in their kids, so Israel cares about their people, and Israel's announcing a big push to get folks on iodine.
[02:04:26.836 --> 02:04:28.397]  Well, I hope they get people on good iodine.
[02:04:28.397 --> 02:04:34.262]  I don't care if it's people, or Palestinians, or Jews, or Germans, or whoever everybody is.
[02:04:34.262 --> 02:04:37.405]  Obviously, we want to make money to fund the operation, but we promote what's good.
[02:04:37.405 --> 02:04:43.010]  It's like this Vox article goes, they promote you need biome, you need stuff in your gut, good bacteria.
[02:04:43.550 --> 02:04:45.833]  And they make up a false crisis to sell it.
[02:04:45.833 --> 02:04:54.985]  Everybody, it's like almost 100% known that there's a gut crisis because of pesticides in the food, killing your good bacteria and antibiotics, and then you've got to replace them.
[02:04:54.985 --> 02:04:57.207]  Everybody knows yogurt and stuff's important.
[02:04:57.207 --> 02:04:59.851]  I mean, we're not reinventing the wheel here.
[02:05:01.192 --> 02:05:06.594]  Corey Lewandowski, Paul Manafort, Mike Flynn, Steve Bannon, and now Devin Nunes.
[02:05:06.594 --> 02:05:09.816]  It seems the left's intimidation tactics are actually working.
[02:05:09.816 --> 02:05:17.999]  Nunes is the latest to be asked to step aside after an intense few weeks of grilling from the left, as the House Intelligence Chairman has now recused himself from the Russian probe.
[02:05:17.999 --> 02:05:19.880]  Isn't that too convenient for the Democrats?
[02:05:20.120 --> 02:05:26.267]  To have the only one involved in this Russian probe who actually seems to care about the truth of the matter, step aside and recuse himself.
[02:05:26.267 --> 02:05:37.459]  Just to rub our noses in it, Representative Adam Schiff, Democrat member of the House Intelligence Committee, made a public statement moments after Nunes' announcement saying how pleased he was to hear of Nunes' recusal.
[02:05:37.459 --> 02:05:37.860]  So now...
[02:05:38.120 --> 02:05:41.783]  The Democrats have a monopoly on the political witch hunt that is the Russian probe.
[02:05:41.783 --> 02:05:42.684]  Thanks, Nunes.
[02:05:42.684 --> 02:05:46.326]  The Republicans have gotten their leverage democratically and refuse to use it.
[02:05:46.326 --> 02:05:50.269]  The Democrats get their leverage with smear campaigns and use it successfully.
[02:05:50.269 --> 02:05:53.512]  And if we keep allowing them to do it, they're going to continue.
[02:05:53.512 --> 02:05:56.234]  President Trump, the swamp is draining us.
[02:05:56.234 --> 02:05:58.596]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.
[02:06:01.005 --> 02:06:06.471]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling super blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:06:06.471 --> 02:06:08.573]  Research across the board is clear.
[02:06:08.573 --> 02:06:13.858]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[02:06:13.858 --> 02:06:17.602]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that
[02:06:17.702 --> 02:06:21.144]  Your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[02:06:21.144 --> 02:06:24.325]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[02:06:24.325 --> 02:06:28.207]  It's loaded with good halogen iodine instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[02:06:28.207 --> 02:06:35.370]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[02:06:35.370 --> 02:06:40.773]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil,
[02:06:41.033 --> 02:06:43.075]  Iodine, nano, silver, and more.
[02:06:43.075 --> 02:06:51.385]  Due to requests from listeners who found that Spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their children, we have created the new Bubble Gum flavored Super Blue that is Spearmint free.
[02:06:51.385 --> 02:06:59.694]  Learn more about the new Bubble Gum flavored Super Blue toothpaste and more at InfoWarsLife.com and support the Info War while you support healthy gums and teeth.
[02:07:00.694 --> 02:07:01.534]  Hey, everyone!
[02:07:01.534 --> 02:07:03.815]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side.
[02:07:03.815 --> 02:07:07.656]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[02:07:07.656 --> 02:07:09.737]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[02:07:09.737 --> 02:07:20.021]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[02:07:20.021 --> 02:07:25.983]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[02:07:26.463 --> 02:07:41.320]  If you're dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino
[02:07:41.340 --> 02:07:41.821]  I think so.
[02:08:11.730 --> 02:08:17.833]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:17.833 --> 02:08:25.537]  We will never surrender to the globalists.
[02:08:42.662 --> 02:08:45.263]  It's a great song right here.
[02:08:45.263 --> 02:08:53.886]  Never get sick of this song.
[02:08:53.886 --> 02:09:00.108]  Eric Clapton breaking his hand.
[02:09:00.108 --> 02:09:03.609]  What an incredible career from cream right through all the things he's done.
[02:09:03.609 --> 02:09:04.029]  Amazing.
[02:09:06.513 --> 02:09:22.796]  All right, joining us until the bottom of the hour is Michael Snyder, and then we're going to air Pedophiles Rule the World special report from Paul Watson that only covers the confirmed mainstream news.
[02:09:22.796 --> 02:09:27.917]  World leaders murdering children, torturing them to death, devil worship, you name it.
[02:09:27.917 --> 02:09:35.158]  It's only part one in ten reports he's going to file just chronicling all the admissions and the convictions.
[02:09:38.530 --> 02:09:41.412]  And he says at the beginning of it, you know, Pizzagate has been discredited.
[02:09:41.412 --> 02:09:43.434]  No, not that they're using pizza code words.
[02:09:43.434 --> 02:09:45.216]  The media focused on one place.
[02:09:45.216 --> 02:09:46.977]  Some of us took the bait partially.
[02:09:46.977 --> 02:09:51.101]  Then they try to then have a referendum in the news saying pedophilia doesn't exist.
[02:09:51.101 --> 02:09:55.985]  Well, I picked up on it about four or five days into the story.
[02:09:55.985 --> 02:09:57.406]  Pulled back from the beginning.
[02:09:57.406 --> 02:09:58.947]  MSM took that as a sign of weakness.
[02:09:59.963 --> 02:10:02.146]  And said, oh look, he's been retracting and pulling back.
[02:10:02.146 --> 02:10:04.810]  Yeah, because I don't lie about people on purpose.
[02:10:04.810 --> 02:10:09.717]  I don't have malice of forethought or intent to do harm of people that are innocent.
[02:10:09.717 --> 02:10:12.181]  If I can prove you're bad or done something, I'll come after you.
[02:10:14.121 --> 02:10:15.642]  But that's how Karl Rove used to set people up.
[02:10:15.642 --> 02:10:20.285]  Remember, he would have a big data mine of real news, but put disinfo in the middle of it.
[02:10:20.285 --> 02:10:24.208]  So that's coming up in about 35 after or so.
[02:10:24.208 --> 02:10:27.830]  Michael Snyder, of course, reaches millions of people a week.
[02:10:27.830 --> 02:10:31.613]  He has an amazing website, economiccollapseblog.com.
[02:10:31.613 --> 02:10:32.653]  He's got others.
[02:10:32.653 --> 02:10:40.499]  And he just takes all the news, all the intel of mainstream news, alternative news, legislation, video clips, and weaves them together.
[02:10:42.190 --> 02:10:57.313]  Show that you can get a picture of what's coming, and he's been laying out the trigger in the Middle East and Syria, the trigger in the South China Sea, the trigger of the Democrats trying to push COG, and that mainline analysts across the board are saying, this is how world wars start.
[02:10:57.313 --> 02:11:06.695]  And I had Dr. Paul Craig Roberts on, former head of policy at the Treasury, part of the big fall of the Soviet Union, negotiated that, really smart guy.
[02:11:06.695 --> 02:11:10.236]  Concurring that this is the most dangerous time ever for humanity.
[02:11:10.236 --> 02:11:11.156]  Rand Paul saying that.
[02:11:12.742 --> 02:11:14.944]  We've had so many others on breaking that down.
[02:11:14.944 --> 02:11:23.994]  This is such an incredible time with all of this and then to see them trying to kill Trump's global recovery initiative when globalism is meant to make you poor.
[02:11:23.994 --> 02:11:30.901]  Well, true nationalism coming back will make everybody wealthier and create competition and not let the elites fix prices and lower wages.
[02:11:31.860 --> 02:11:41.807]  And to see the left cheerleading and Schumer, I'll play the clip in a moment, saying that Trump's like an idiotic 98-pound weakling before the Chinese.
[02:11:41.807 --> 02:11:49.533]  To see how un-American they are and to see them rooting for our fall, I wonder what's going on with some American people that buy into this.
[02:11:49.533 --> 02:11:50.354]  But here's the news.
[02:11:50.354 --> 02:11:51.595]  We know the polls are fake.
[02:11:51.595 --> 02:11:54.117]  They've always been 15, 20 points against Trump.
[02:11:54.117 --> 02:11:56.899]  So Trump is still very, very popular, but he is now faltering.
[02:11:58.436 --> 02:12:01.237]  With the neocons he's put in and the military positions.
[02:12:01.237 --> 02:12:03.258]  I was hoping they just followed neocon orders.
[02:12:03.258 --> 02:12:07.820]  They're continuing all the neocon stuff now that this batch of generals got in.
[02:12:07.820 --> 02:12:11.622]  And they are just full steam ahead with rack and ruin, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:12:11.622 --> 02:12:20.105]  So here to talk about the nightmare scenarios, not to fearmonger, but to let the public know what's happening, to turn this around, is Michael Snyder.
[02:12:20.105 --> 02:12:21.426]  Michael, wow, what a time to be alive.
[02:12:22.743 --> 02:12:30.629]  Oh definitely Alex, and actually I'm more alarmed now than I've been in well over a year of the situation, the global situation with Trump.
[02:12:30.629 --> 02:12:48.301]  We thought it was all going to be about domestic policy, about the economy, but instead foreign policy is becoming front and center this week with the situation with North Korea, where CNN says a White House official said time has now run out on the North Korea nuclear program, and that they said all options are on the table.
[02:12:48.301 --> 02:12:52.044]  And this is a phrase that has been used repeatedly by members of the Trump administration,
[02:12:52.404 --> 02:13:02.848]  And basically what it is, it's a threat of war to North Korea saying, if you keep trying to get an ICBM which could hit the United States, we are going to strike you militarily.
[02:13:02.848 --> 02:13:05.289]  So they are openly threatening North Korea with war.
[02:13:05.289 --> 02:13:11.992]  Of course, Trump is meeting with the President of China this week, you know, right here at the end of this week.
[02:13:11.992 --> 02:13:14.713]  And China is going to try to buy some time because they don't want the U.S.
[02:13:14.713 --> 02:13:16.074]  to strike North Korea.
[02:13:16.074 --> 02:13:20.255]  But people need to understand, this isn't like Afghanistan or Iraq or Libya.
[02:13:20.255 --> 02:13:21.816]  It's a totally different animal.
[02:13:22.216 --> 02:13:27.482]  Because North Korea, they've got the fourth largest military on the entire planet, and they've got nukes.
[02:13:27.482 --> 02:13:30.645]  They've got nuclear weapons, and they're not afraid to use them.
[02:13:30.645 --> 02:13:36.392]  And they've got brainwashed fighters that we learned about in 1950 that will do whatever they're told in a fight to the death.
[02:13:37.540 --> 02:13:38.281]  They do.
[02:13:38.281 --> 02:13:42.284]  I mean, this is a society that are absolutely obsessed with the destruction of the United States.
[02:13:42.284 --> 02:13:44.806]  It's one of the central pillars of their society.
[02:13:44.806 --> 02:13:53.833]  And so if we strike them, if we were to go to war, and Trump, you know, a lot of people are used to politicians making pledges and promises and threats that they never carry out.
[02:13:53.833 --> 02:13:58.196]  You know, like Obama, he would threaten other nations but then actually never do anything.
[02:13:58.196 --> 02:14:00.578]  I believe that Donald Trump means what he says.
[02:14:00.578 --> 02:14:07.083]  And so when he says, time has run out, all options are on the table, I believe that he's actually considering a military strike on North Korea.
[02:14:07.443 --> 02:14:08.404]  No, they've said they are.
[02:14:08.404 --> 02:14:09.125]  They've said they are.
[02:14:09.125 --> 02:14:11.428]  And top generals have said it may be the only option.
[02:14:11.428 --> 02:14:13.390]  And I understand even what they're saying.
[02:14:13.390 --> 02:14:17.375]  The issue is, why did our elites do this, A and then B?
[02:14:17.375 --> 02:14:21.140]  How this goes down is, they start fueling those rockets, put an A-bomb on there.
[02:14:21.140 --> 02:14:22.061]  We hit it.
[02:14:23.513 --> 02:14:25.215]  They then attack Seoul.
[02:14:25.215 --> 02:14:27.617]  Hundreds of thousands of troops pour across.
[02:14:27.617 --> 02:14:31.181]  They launch another missile at Seoul with an atomic weapon.
[02:14:31.181 --> 02:14:32.362]  Who knows?
[02:14:32.362 --> 02:14:34.705]  Then instantly, we respond with nukes.
[02:14:34.705 --> 02:14:35.085]  Boom.
[02:14:35.085 --> 02:14:36.907]  China comes in.
[02:14:36.907 --> 02:14:38.349]  You'll wake up dead.
[02:14:38.349 --> 02:14:40.611]  The hydrogen bombs will rain down at 2 a.m.
[02:14:40.611 --> 02:14:43.995]  30 minutes after this starts and you'll never even know what hit you.
[02:14:45.228 --> 02:14:48.090]  Yeah, this could be the spark of World War 3.
[02:14:48.090 --> 02:14:53.533]  And so people need to understand, because the instant we strike North Korea, they're going to start firing back.
[02:14:53.533 --> 02:14:58.456]  Now they've got thousands of artillery pieces and rockets trained on a South Korean trained on Seoul.
[02:14:58.456 --> 02:14:59.317]  100,000 artillery pieces.
[02:15:01.431 --> 02:15:06.473]  Yeah, and they've got one of the biggest stockpiles of chemical warheads on the entire planet.
[02:15:06.473 --> 02:15:18.078]  So even if somehow we got all their nukes, there would still be nerve gas warheads, hundreds of them, hundreds and hundreds in Seoul and other major South Korean cities, possibly even in Japan, Tokyo.
[02:15:18.078 --> 02:15:20.599]  And then if we don't get every single one of their nukes...
[02:15:20.979 --> 02:15:25.863]  If we don't get every single one of their nukes, they're going to start firing what they have left at U.S.
[02:15:25.863 --> 02:15:27.524]  military bases in Japan.
[02:15:27.524 --> 02:15:31.527]  Possibly, could you imagine a nuke hitting Tokyo or hitting Seoul?
[02:15:31.527 --> 02:15:34.270]  I mean, we're talking about an apocalyptic event.
[02:15:34.270 --> 02:15:36.872]  And plus, as you mentioned, instantly what would happen?
[02:15:36.872 --> 02:15:40.735]  We strike North Korea, they're going to launch an invasion of South Korea.
[02:15:40.735 --> 02:15:47.360]  And thousands upon thousands of troops are going to start pouring across the border because North Korea has a vastly larger military than South Korea.
[02:15:47.700 --> 02:15:50.923]  The only way that South Korea could survive is if the U.S.
[02:15:50.923 --> 02:15:58.049]  intervened militarily on a massive scale with ground troops, and then as you said, you know, nukes could get involved, China could come in.
[02:15:58.049 --> 02:16:01.352]  And then just like the 1950s, the Chinese come in.
[02:16:01.352 --> 02:16:09.359]  Yeah, yeah, just like the original Korean War, where we had won the Korean War, North Korea was defeated, but then Chinese troops started pouring across the border.
[02:16:10.626 --> 02:16:17.691]  Because China has an uneasy relationship with North Korea, but they want North Korea to survive.
[02:16:17.691 --> 02:16:22.214]  They like that North Korea is a thorn in the side of the United States.
[02:16:22.214 --> 02:16:24.455]  So China desperately does not want the U.S.
[02:16:24.455 --> 02:16:25.536]  to attack North Korea.
[02:16:25.536 --> 02:16:29.539]  And if we do attack them, our relationship with China is essentially over.
[02:16:29.539 --> 02:16:31.340]  It's going to be... By the way, that's a good scenario.
[02:16:31.340 --> 02:16:35.923]  As you know, most analysts believe this will probably lead to a full-scale nuclear war within hours.
[02:16:37.170 --> 02:16:39.671]  Yeah, and so that's the nightmare scenario.
[02:16:39.671 --> 02:16:47.655]  At a minimum, we could see millions of people die in either South Korea and Seoul, in Japan.
[02:16:47.655 --> 02:16:58.081]  And so, at a minimum, we could see our relationships with South Korea and Japan, because they would blame us if something goes bad and their cities start getting hit with nuclear or chemical weapons, nerve gas.
[02:16:58.661 --> 02:17:05.769]  They're going to blame us, and our relationship with Japan and South Korea could be damaged forever.
[02:17:05.769 --> 02:17:17.502]  We can't let North Korea get ICBMs which could threaten our mainland, but on the other hand, I don't see how an attack on North Korea could go well, how it could be done successfully.
[02:17:17.802 --> 02:17:20.544]  The problem is they keep shooting missiles at Japan, threatening to nuke everybody.
[02:17:20.544 --> 02:17:22.225]  I mean, we have a right to respond, quite frankly.
[02:17:22.225 --> 02:17:24.346]  You point a gun at somebody and say, I'm going to blow your head off.
[02:17:24.346 --> 02:17:27.088]  Then you start shooting at the ground right by their foot, like Japan.
[02:17:27.088 --> 02:17:30.670]  I mean, I expect Japan to start attacking, and they've got a formidable defense force.
[02:17:30.670 --> 02:17:33.272]  But expanding on that, then, Michael Schneider of the Economic Collapse Blog.
[02:17:34.850 --> 02:17:37.093]  How does the economy come into all this?
[02:17:37.093 --> 02:17:45.942]  And then how does starting another war in the Middle East or going up against the Russians in Syria with this clear false flag that Ron Paul's talking about and that we broke yesterday?
[02:17:45.942 --> 02:17:47.724]  I mean, it just seems like madness!
[02:17:49.153 --> 02:17:56.317]  It is madness and I'm so alarmed that the Trump administration seems to be falling for this because they tried it several times.
[02:17:56.317 --> 02:18:01.540]  The rebel forces in Syria tried this several times while Obama was in office.
[02:18:01.540 --> 02:18:09.244]  A false flag, a chemical attack against their own people to try to get the sympathy of the world, to try to draw the United States into the war in Syria.
[02:18:09.244 --> 02:18:14.927]  And Obama, you know, protested but he never actually committed our forces there.
[02:18:14.927 --> 02:18:17.909]  But I guess they figured it was worth a try with Trump.
[02:18:18.129 --> 02:18:19.749]  And Trump appears to be falling for it.
[02:18:19.749 --> 02:18:25.691]  And it deeply alarmed me when Trump got up in front of the press and he said, hey, for me, that crosses many, many lines.
[02:18:25.691 --> 02:18:28.552]  In fact, he said that goes beyond a red line.
[02:18:28.552 --> 02:18:33.453]  Well, at the same time, he's criticizing Obama for saying red line and then never actually doing anything.
[02:18:33.453 --> 02:18:35.874]  No, I got to tell you, he's got these generals in there.
[02:18:35.874 --> 02:18:38.755]  I just don't want my kids to die.
[02:18:38.755 --> 02:18:40.475]  And I get we've got to be strong to China.
[02:18:40.475 --> 02:18:43.296]  And I disagree with Roberts where he's like, oh, China's not evil.
[02:18:43.296 --> 02:18:43.796]  Give me a break.
[02:18:43.796 --> 02:18:44.917]  China's completely out of control.
[02:18:46.633 --> 02:18:48.715]  Our elite have armed these people.
[02:18:48.715 --> 02:18:50.356]  They've propped them up, they gave them all our jobs.
[02:18:50.356 --> 02:18:52.717]  That's why I hate our elite more than the Chinese Communists.
[02:18:52.717 --> 02:18:54.058]  I'm just sick of it.
[02:18:54.058 --> 02:18:55.579]  Why create this world?
[02:18:55.579 --> 02:19:12.651]  I've studied everything they've done, and it's all self-serving crap for bigger mansions, and then endangering the world, and then when these forces come together, the very people that put them into motion stand around like our heroes, wanting the end of the planet, so they can act like they've got the biggest, you know, wee-wees.
[02:19:12.651 --> 02:19:13.532]  I mean, I'm just tired of it.
[02:19:14.713 --> 02:19:21.336]  Yeah, these neocons are literally insane, and it's all about money and power and wealth and all the things you talked about.
[02:19:21.336 --> 02:19:25.498]  But people like McMaster, they seem to be becoming more prominent in the Trump administration.
[02:19:25.498 --> 02:19:26.718]  They're getting into his ear.
[02:19:26.718 --> 02:19:30.100]  He's surrounded by these generals, these hawks, these neocons.
[02:19:30.100 --> 02:19:31.660]  They all jack each other up.
[02:19:31.660 --> 02:19:32.661]  They all get each other up.
[02:19:32.661 --> 02:19:35.282]  You know, sir, we've got all these secret weapons and all this ready.
[02:19:35.282 --> 02:19:38.543]  It doesn't matter if 2% of the Russian weapons get through to the Chinese.
[02:19:38.543 --> 02:19:39.124]  We're all dead.
[02:19:40.044 --> 02:19:41.846]  You can't do it!
[02:19:41.846 --> 02:19:43.708]  Oh man, I'm so tired of it.
[02:19:43.708 --> 02:19:46.351]  I mean, it's just... I'll just say this, Dan.
[02:19:46.351 --> 02:19:48.553]  If Trump's gonna do it, he should just pre-strike him.
[02:19:48.553 --> 02:19:49.735]  I mean, that's the only chance we've got.
[02:19:49.735 --> 02:19:53.198]  If he's gonna be psychotic, then hit him first, like Curtis LeMay said.
[02:19:53.198 --> 02:19:55.261]  Should've done this a long time ago, though.
[02:19:55.261 --> 02:19:56.422]  Should've done this in the 1950s, man.
[02:19:56.422 --> 02:19:59.866]  If we were gonna destroy the Russians and the Chinese, it should've been done then.
[02:19:59.866 --> 02:20:00.767]  And I'm not advocating that.
[02:20:01.327 --> 02:20:03.749]  We use cell phones against our heads every day.
[02:20:03.749 --> 02:20:05.150]  But now a landmark U.S.

[02:21:31.608 --> 02:21:36.390]  Barack Obama's most loyal aides still hold office and they want to stop President Trump.
[02:21:36.390 --> 02:21:40.451]  Deep State was first revealed in the runaway New York Times bestseller Big Agenda.

[02:22:45.110 --> 02:22:48.012]  It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.

[02:24:06.043 --> 02:24:08.985]  In our news media report a few months ago about what they call the Satan Rocket.
[02:24:08.985 --> 02:24:14.109]  It's not called that in Russia, but it would destroy an entire surface area of Texas or France.
[02:24:14.109 --> 02:24:16.070]  We can put that on screen for TV viewers.
[02:24:16.070 --> 02:24:21.174]  And then while Michael Snyder is speaking, I'm going to go to your calls after he leaves us in a special report from Paul Watson.
[02:24:21.174 --> 02:24:27.199]  We're going to show you Google Maps' own historic megaton test ranges and what even weapons in the 60s would do.
[02:24:28.059 --> 02:24:35.045]  But Russia unveils Satan 2 missile and that could wipe out France or Texas with the type of megaton weapons it carries.
[02:24:35.045 --> 02:24:36.025]  Multiple ones, by the way.
[02:24:36.025 --> 02:24:38.467]  And of course, there's a lot more advanced stuff than that.
[02:24:38.467 --> 02:24:46.934]  They admitted the Air Force by the 90s developed anti-matter bombs that would destroy, if they theoretically tested them, they would destroy most of the solar system.
[02:24:47.834 --> 02:24:49.254]  What's the point of that?
[02:24:49.254 --> 02:24:50.195]  I don't know.
[02:24:50.195 --> 02:24:53.636]  But we're reaching that Atlantis moment, whether Atlantis existed or not.
[02:24:53.636 --> 02:24:59.377]  In the fable of Atlantis, the legend, they get some super technology that blows the whole island up.
[02:24:59.377 --> 02:25:01.818]  And Plato lived only, you know, a few thousand years after.
[02:25:01.818 --> 02:25:02.578]  He said no.
[02:25:02.578 --> 02:25:04.198]  He had the annals, the books about it.
[02:25:04.198 --> 02:25:04.599]  It happened.
[02:25:04.599 --> 02:25:08.660]  And some Atlanteans were on ships, you know, and came back to Greece.
[02:25:08.660 --> 02:25:13.061]  And Greece was probably founded by people, just fragments of the Atlantean memory.
[02:25:13.821 --> 02:25:17.202]  But whether that was real or not, folks, we're now at the Atlantis moment.
[02:25:17.202 --> 02:25:19.382]  Michael Snyder, you know, I don't know if you have kids.
[02:25:19.382 --> 02:25:21.523]  I have children, especially my little daughters.
[02:25:21.523 --> 02:25:27.064]  And I see this news, and I see how sweet they are, and it really makes me angry.
[02:25:27.064 --> 02:25:29.004]  Yeah, I don't want war either, Alex.
[02:25:29.004 --> 02:25:31.465]  And that's why I'm so alarmed by what's happened this week.
[02:25:31.465 --> 02:25:35.205]  We already talked about how North Korea could potentially spark a war with China.
[02:25:35.205 --> 02:25:38.586]  Well, the situation with Syria, if it was just Syria, it wouldn't be that big of a deal.
[02:25:38.586 --> 02:25:41.587]  And Trump could do whatever he wanted if it was just Syria.
[02:25:41.587 --> 02:25:42.687]  But the Russians are there.
[02:25:43.087 --> 02:25:48.048]  And the Russians are mixed in among the Syrian forces, and they're at the Syrian air bases in particular.
[02:25:48.048 --> 02:25:57.530]  So Trump, with his words and the members of his administration in recent days, they've kind of committed themselves to taking some sort of action in response to this false flag chemical attack.
[02:25:57.530 --> 02:25:58.930]  But they've kind of committed themselves.
[02:25:58.930 --> 02:26:07.712]  But if they do anything, and the bombs start dropping, and the Russians, their people are being killed, their force is under threat, are the Russians just going to sit there and do nothing?
[02:26:07.712 --> 02:26:09.212]  Or are they going to respond?
[02:26:09.212 --> 02:26:10.793]  I believe the Russians would start responding.
[02:26:10.793 --> 02:26:11.873]  They would start shooting back.
[02:26:12.113 --> 02:26:14.555]  So what happens if, okay, U.S.
[02:26:14.555 --> 02:26:19.920]  warplanes go in, they start bombing, and then Russian missiles, the S-300 starts taking U.S.
[02:26:19.920 --> 02:26:28.828]  airplanes out, we start seeing F-16s fall out of the sky on CNN, what's that going to do to the anti-Russian hysteria in Washington that's already at cold
[02:26:28.908 --> 02:26:30.630]  It's going to make the civil war even worse.
[02:26:30.630 --> 02:26:34.813]  If they can't dig out Al-Qaeda and ISIS, they're going to have even more trouble digging out all the Iranians that are in there.
[02:26:46.997 --> 02:26:49.441]  Yeah, and there's nothing to be gained in there.
[02:26:49.441 --> 02:26:53.388]  As Trump has been saying for so long, there's nothing to be gained for us to go into Syria.
[02:26:53.388 --> 02:26:58.898]  Just so folks know, the Iranians, I'd say, what, five times better fighters, is what military's told me, than the Al-Qaeda people?
[02:27:00.103 --> 02:27:00.643]  Yeah.
[02:27:00.643 --> 02:27:03.585]  And so, you know, there's so much that could go wrong.
[02:27:03.585 --> 02:27:05.166]  We don't want a conflict with Iran.
[02:27:05.166 --> 02:27:07.608]  We don't even want a conflict with Hezbollah.
[02:27:07.608 --> 02:27:08.809]  They're pretty serious.
[02:27:08.809 --> 02:27:10.289]  But especially with Russia.
[02:27:10.289 --> 02:27:13.311]  Our relationship with Russia is already quite tenuous.
[02:27:13.311 --> 02:27:22.017]  And if we go in and dead bodies of Russian service members start showing up on Russian television, you know, the Russians are going to totally turn against Trump.
[02:27:22.017 --> 02:27:26.220]  Any hope of restoring relations... But then I turn on Fox and they've got former generals going, what we need is Russian body bags.
[02:27:26.220 --> 02:27:27.300]  That'll teach them.
[02:27:27.300 --> 02:27:28.261]  Which, historically,
[02:27:28.701 --> 02:27:30.562]  That doesn't work with any powerful country.
[02:27:30.562 --> 02:27:31.703]  It's never worked with Russia.
[02:27:31.703 --> 02:27:35.125]  Like, you kill Russians, they're just going to crap their pants?
[02:27:35.125 --> 02:27:36.746]  Yeah, Russia doesn't back down.
[02:27:36.746 --> 02:27:40.108]  Russia is not intimidated by anyone.
[02:27:40.108 --> 02:27:42.830]  The Russians, historically, are fighters.
[02:27:42.830 --> 02:27:50.355]  And so, you know, we had hoped that with Trump coming in, we could have a better relationship with Russia, but this thing with Syria could actually make it far, far worse.
[02:27:50.355 --> 02:27:51.736]  Well, he better listen to Rand Paul.
[02:27:51.736 --> 02:27:53.197]  I mean, isn't Rand Paul the hero of the moment?
[02:27:54.137 --> 02:27:58.201]  I mean, he's there saying, stop it Trump, do not do this, do not back Al-Qaeda.
[02:27:58.201 --> 02:28:01.605]  We need the military, everybody start tweeting the photos again.
[02:28:01.605 --> 02:28:07.230]  I'm sorry, Trump, I will not back an air force bombardment of Syria for Al-Qaeda.
[02:28:07.230 --> 02:28:09.753]  Because that's Al-Qaeda slash ISIS, same group.
[02:28:09.753 --> 02:28:18.181]  And you know, here it is, we've got to give the president the political support he needs to make the right decisions or they're going to bully him and say he's for nerve-gassing little kids.
[02:28:19.508 --> 02:28:25.771]  Yeah, my regard for Rand Paul has gone way up, not only because of this, but because of the Obamacare thing and everything else.
[02:28:25.771 --> 02:28:28.072]  So, I'm so glad that he's standing up for the truth.
[02:28:28.072 --> 02:28:32.474]  But, you know, with the situation in Syria, it was started back in 2011.
[02:28:32.474 --> 02:28:38.676]  Arab Spring was going on, and so Hillary Clinton, who was Secretary of State at the time, got together with Saudi Arabia and Turkey.
[02:28:38.676 --> 02:28:39.317]  And she branched!
[02:28:39.317 --> 02:28:40.177]  She did!
[02:28:40.177 --> 02:28:42.198]  And then they blamed Trump!
[02:28:42.198 --> 02:28:44.339]  They're in the news today saying this is all his fault.
[02:28:44.339 --> 02:28:45.079]  What the?
[02:28:45.079 --> 02:28:46.560]  They blame Obamacare on him!
[02:28:48.295 --> 02:29:08.754]  It's insane, but it was originally hatched by Hillary Clinton, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey, and they were funding and supporting the rebels, trying to overthrow Assad, and so that was their plan all along, to take Syria from the Iranian axis of power and turn it into a full-fledged Sunni nation aligned with Saudi Arabia and Turkey, and so that's been the whole goal all along.
[02:29:11.983 --> 02:29:25.006]  Yeah, and at first it was working, but then in came Russia and Iran and Hezbollah, turned the tide of the war, and so now the rebels are about to lose, and the only way, the only thing that could turn the tide of the war is the intervention of the Western powers.
[02:29:25.006 --> 02:29:30.087]  And this is what's crazy, our military is in there knocking out Al-Qaeda and ISIS because Trump demanded that.
[02:29:30.087 --> 02:29:34.528]  He's not getting the generals that are now, sir, this next move, because they followed his orders there.
[02:29:35.228 --> 02:29:38.812]  His next move is to basically bring down the whole country.
[02:29:38.812 --> 02:29:43.196]  Michael Schneider, TheEconomicClassBlog.com, thank you so much, sir.
[02:29:43.196 --> 02:29:43.617]  Thank you.
[02:29:43.617 --> 02:29:46.680]  Folks, you cannot hype this up enough how dangerous this is.
[02:29:46.680 --> 02:29:49.663]  Coming up, Paul Watson's special report, your phone calls, and a lot more.
[02:29:49.663 --> 02:29:50.264]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:29:50.264 --> 02:29:51.545]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.545 --> 02:29:53.086]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.086 --> 02:29:54.107]  We were on the march.
[02:29:54.107 --> 02:29:55.589]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:55.589 --> 02:29:57.191]  We're getting stuck in the mud right now, folks.
[02:30:01.291 --> 02:30:06.397]  While the swamp is competitive in the political battle, it does seem the cultural swamp is being drained.
[02:30:06.397 --> 02:30:11.943]  Shia LaBeouf's most recent film, Man Down, had a blockbuster opening day with a huge ticket sale.
[02:30:11.943 --> 02:30:13.245]  Yes, one ticket.
[02:30:13.245 --> 02:30:17.069]  Since opening night last weekend, ticket sales have totaled a whopping three.
[02:30:17.069 --> 02:30:19.112]  He's had more flags stolen than ticket sales.
[02:30:19.352 --> 02:30:23.835]  So Shia's childish antics on the streets earned him more attention than his actual job.
[02:30:23.835 --> 02:30:28.537]  Meanwhile, InStyle Magazine had to publish a story to boost Amy Schumer's crushed ego.
[02:30:28.537 --> 02:30:32.780]  Headline reading, So now, if a man doesn't like a woman, it's because he's sexist.
[02:30:36.502 --> 02:30:41.924]  How dare you not like my strong, proud woman who breaks all the social paradigms by trying to be elegant and abhorrent at the same time.
[02:30:41.924 --> 02:30:42.204]  See?
[02:30:42.204 --> 02:30:43.904]  Women can do and be anything.
[02:30:43.904 --> 02:30:45.505]  Yes, including too vulgar.
[02:30:45.505 --> 02:30:50.127]  I ran a series of polls on Twitter called Who's the Worst, and Amy Schumer won.
[02:30:50.127 --> 02:30:51.147]  The people have spoken.
[02:30:51.147 --> 02:30:52.787]  Amy Schumer is the worst.
[02:30:52.787 --> 02:30:55.929]  But if the left wants her to be their poster child, go ahead.
[02:30:55.929 --> 02:30:57.729]  We will keep winning the culture war.
[02:30:57.729 --> 02:31:00.070]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroyer.

[02:32:01.124 --> 02:32:02.965]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[02:32:02.965 --> 02:32:09.567]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[02:32:09.567 --> 02:32:12.728]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarsline.com.
[02:32:12.728 --> 02:32:22.511]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single, great-tasting formula.
[02:32:22.511 --> 02:32:23.352]  Caveman.
[02:32:23.352 --> 02:32:28.433]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[02:32:28.433 --> 02:32:30.534]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[02:32:30.834 --> 02:32:33.976]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[02:32:33.976 --> 02:32:39.120]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[02:32:39.120 --> 02:32:47.285]  From the outside structure full of minerals and chemical factors, to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[02:32:47.285 --> 02:32:55.111]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[02:32:55.111 --> 02:32:59.874]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself in 4WordsLife.com today.
[02:33:13.992 --> 02:33:19.397]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:33:19.397 --> 02:33:26.003]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:26.003 --> 02:33:36.432]  You know, I don't want to cover this whole pedophile subject because it makes my skin crawl, but... Mainstream news, judges...
[02:33:38.012 --> 02:33:39.453]  You name it, have come out and said no.
[02:33:39.453 --> 02:33:43.196]  It's international rings of rich people doing horrible things.
[02:33:43.196 --> 02:33:52.102]  So Michael Snyder, I appreciate you holding over just to give a quick comment on just in general the elites and what drives them from your deep research.
[02:33:52.102 --> 02:33:55.424]  What do you think's behind all this, this raw lust for power?
[02:33:55.424 --> 02:33:56.445]  It's beyond nihilism.
[02:33:56.445 --> 02:34:00.548]  It's like we must rule or we'll die trying and then selfishly destroy the planet.
[02:34:02.276 --> 02:34:12.259]  Yeah, the elite feel like they're smarter than everyone else, and the elite feel like they were born to rule, that they have a right to rule, and that they know better than everyone else.
[02:34:12.259 --> 02:34:19.761]  Some of them actually consider themselves kind of benevolent dictators, that they know what the world should do, and so they're going to impose that.
[02:34:19.761 --> 02:34:26.683]  And I believe that right now they're setting up Trump on multiple levels, not only for war, but here with the government, the whole government situation.
[02:34:26.683 --> 02:34:27.223]  You know, Alex,
[02:34:27.583 --> 02:34:32.825]  The Congress is about to go on a two-week recess, in which, you know, who gets two weeks off for Easter?
[02:34:32.825 --> 02:34:34.026]  I guess Congress does.
[02:34:34.026 --> 02:34:38.568]  But when they come back, there's going to be one week that they have to avoid a government shutdown.
[02:34:38.568 --> 02:34:43.130]  And if they don't get something done, the government will shut down on April 29th.
[02:34:43.130 --> 02:34:45.431]  Now, can they get that done in a week?
[02:34:45.431 --> 02:34:47.752]  I don't think so, for multiple reasons.
[02:34:47.752 --> 02:34:50.133]  Planned Parenthood, dozens of other things that need to be negotiated.
[02:34:50.133 --> 02:34:54.395]  The Democrats are totally obstructionists, like this new Trump thing to say, I'm going to work with Democrats.
[02:34:54.395 --> 02:34:54.575]  What?
[02:34:56.129 --> 02:34:58.830]  Yeah, but the Democrats have no intention of it happening.
[02:34:58.830 --> 02:35:04.073]  In fact, I think the Democrats actually want a government shutdown, because it's going to make Trump and the Republicans look bad.
[02:35:04.073 --> 02:35:07.655]  So they're perfectly fine to just sit back and let the government shut down.
[02:35:07.655 --> 02:35:10.336]  And so Trump and the Republicans need to get together.
[02:35:10.336 --> 02:35:16.199]  But then the thing is, to get it through the Senate, they're going to need Democrat help, because the Democrats could kill a bunch of people.
[02:35:16.199 --> 02:35:19.661]  And they're too busy hunting for Rooskies when they're actually on the payroll.
[02:35:19.661 --> 02:35:22.743]  In one minute, what can citizens do?
[02:35:24.420 --> 02:35:31.202]  Well, we need to continue to fight the information war like never before, particularly this thing with the war we've been talking about this past half hour.
[02:35:31.202 --> 02:35:38.624]  We need to scream bloody murder for Trump not to do this, because everyone in Washington... Just like in 2013, we are not Al Qaeda's air force.
[02:35:38.624 --> 02:35:45.086]  Yeah, you know, when Obama was considering it in 2013, the public really screamed bloody murder.
[02:35:45.086 --> 02:35:45.826]  We don't want this.
[02:35:45.826 --> 02:35:46.887]  We don't want war with Syria.
[02:35:46.887 --> 02:35:51.788]  We need to do the same thing, but even louder, so Trump will hear us.
[02:35:51.788 --> 02:35:53.329]  Michael Schneider, God bless you, my friend.
[02:35:53.329 --> 02:35:53.989]  We'll talk to you soon.
[02:35:54.929 --> 02:35:57.131]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:35:57.131 --> 02:36:00.753]  I know we got people holding, and if you can stay, we'll do it after the 17-minute report.
[02:36:00.753 --> 02:36:03.575]  I will sit here and take your calls and then hand the baton over.
[02:36:03.575 --> 02:36:07.818]  We got Joe and Jason and Herb and Jimmy and Howard and others.
[02:36:07.818 --> 02:36:13.222]  Just briefly, we need your prayers more than anything, and I don't say that like, oh, we're desperate.
[02:36:13.222 --> 02:36:22.068]  I just know that's where the real power is at, and we are under unprecedented, just incremental attack, but it's starting to really accelerate.
[02:36:22.068 --> 02:36:23.769]  Exponentially now, logarithmically,
[02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:28.002]  That orders of power every, you know, few weeks.
[02:36:28.002 --> 02:36:34.846]  And that's because we are affected because our reach, despite all the censorship, is only intensifying as well right now.
[02:36:34.846 --> 02:36:37.268]  So it's a blessing and a curse.
[02:36:37.268 --> 02:36:40.150]  Please buy the products at importrestore.com.
[02:36:40.150 --> 02:36:42.131]  We are running out of the current shipment of iodine.
[02:36:42.131 --> 02:36:43.532]  It's very hard to procure and get.
[02:36:43.532 --> 02:36:44.693]  They're trying to censor.
[02:36:44.693 --> 02:36:45.613]  They're trying to shut us down.
[02:36:45.613 --> 02:36:47.474]  It's the very best iodine out there.
[02:36:47.474 --> 02:36:49.656]  It is, again, the X2 survival shield.
[02:36:51.289 --> 02:36:54.091]  Also, Caveman with the turmeric and the bone broth.
[02:36:54.091 --> 02:36:56.693]  Really, really concentrated formula.
[02:36:56.693 --> 02:36:57.033]  It's here.
[02:36:57.033 --> 02:36:58.194]  It's chocolate flavored.
[02:36:58.194 --> 02:37:00.535]  It tastes really bad without the chocolate in it.
[02:37:00.535 --> 02:37:01.396]  People wanted it flavorless.
[02:37:01.396 --> 02:37:01.816]  We tried it.
[02:37:01.816 --> 02:37:05.659]  It's got a little bit of cocoa in there.
[02:37:05.659 --> 02:37:06.159]  Amazing.
[02:37:06.159 --> 02:37:07.360]  There's so many good things.

[02:37:20.709 --> 02:37:20.949]  I think so.
[02:37:38.103 --> 02:37:40.504]  Well, just all sorts of great products like the BOM Defense Probiotic.
[02:37:40.504 --> 02:37:42.686]  They claim nobody sells probiotics.
[02:37:42.686 --> 02:37:43.386]  They just don't exist.
[02:37:43.386 --> 02:37:46.348]  We're insane when we sell what I believe is the very best out there.
[02:37:46.348 --> 02:37:49.450]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:37:49.450 --> 02:37:49.930]  Okay!
[02:37:49.930 --> 02:37:52.351]  I want to thank the crew.
[02:37:52.351 --> 02:37:53.232]  I want to thank the sponsors.
[02:37:53.232 --> 02:37:56.434]  I want to thank all the affiliates and the good Lord above for the opportunity to be here.
[02:37:56.434 --> 02:37:59.876]  Here's Paul Watson's bombshell report, Pedophiles Rule the World.
[02:38:00.874 --> 02:38:02.875]  So now Pizzagate's been debunked.
[02:38:02.875 --> 02:38:12.082]  That must mean that anyone who talks about the connections between paedophilia and people in positions of power must be a crazy extremist conspiracy theorist, right?
[02:38:12.082 --> 02:38:12.682]  Wrong.
[02:38:12.682 --> 02:38:25.170]  In virtually every major paedophile bust in every major country in the world, top politicians, judges, celebrities, billionaires, and other members of the establishment are always connected.
[02:38:25.170 --> 02:38:26.691]  Conspiracy theory?
[02:38:26.691 --> 02:38:28.192]  Okay, let's take a look.
[02:38:30.814 --> 02:38:38.696]  Epstein, whose friends included some of the most powerful people on the planet, was convicted of soliciting an underage girl for prostitution.
[02:38:38.696 --> 02:38:51.539]  According to Fox News, Epstein allegedly had a team of traffickers who procured girls as young as 12 to service his friends on Orgy Island, an estate on Epstein's 72-acre island called Little St.
[02:38:51.539 --> 02:38:52.779]  James in the U.S.
[02:38:52.779 --> 02:38:53.439]  Virgin Islands.
[02:38:53.619 --> 02:39:04.083]  Why did Bill Clinton take at least 26 trips on the Lolita Express, Epstein's jet, ditching his secret service detail for five of those trips?
[02:39:04.083 --> 02:39:11.666]  A jet accuser say was equipped for sex with underage victims and was used to travel to Epstein's private island, nicknamed Orgy Island.
[02:39:12.006 --> 02:39:22.810]  Newly obtained documents show Clinton actually took at least 26 flights on Epstein's private jet to spots around the globe, though apparently not after Epstein's plea deal and jail time.
[02:39:22.810 --> 02:39:28.491]  On at least five occasions that they did travel together, Secret Service did not accompany Clinton.
[02:39:28.491 --> 02:39:30.372]  You don't just dismiss.
[02:39:30.372 --> 02:39:33.473]  Secret Service detailed paperwork has to be filed.
[02:39:33.473 --> 02:39:35.934]  There's an accounting of why the dismissal.
[02:39:35.934 --> 02:39:36.374]  In this case,
[02:39:37.595 --> 02:39:53.186]  Why did Clinton choose to continue his association with Epstein when, according to the Alliance to Rescue Victims of Trafficking, everyone within his inner circles knew he was a paedophile?
[02:39:53.186 --> 02:39:57.750]  Why did Epstein have 21 different phone numbers for Bill Clinton?
[02:39:57.750 --> 02:40:04.655]  Who were the prominent people Epstein reportedly blackmailed by secretly recording them with these underage girls?
[02:40:04.835 --> 02:40:15.027]  Who are the, quote, powerful associates named by victim Virginia Roberts that US authorities allegedly have on tape having sex with underage girls?
[02:40:15.027 --> 02:40:20.433]  Why did Jeffrey Epstein serve just 13 months in jail for his crimes?
[02:40:20.433 --> 02:40:25.779]  Were Epstein and his friends linked to another elite child sex trafficking network?
[02:40:25.999 --> 02:40:30.761]  One recently exposed by a woman named Kendall on Dr. Phil's show.
[02:40:30.761 --> 02:40:43.825]  Kendall spoke about private parties and islands where she and other children would be taken to be tortured and raped by high-ranking law enforcement officials, major sports figures, and top US politicians.
[02:40:44.025 --> 02:40:51.151]  My whole life I traveled all over the world and would go to some of the biggest events to meet clients and have sex with them.
[02:40:51.151 --> 02:40:54.994]  They were all extremely rich and prominent members of society.
[02:40:54.994 --> 02:40:57.716]  The man who owns me is smart and rich.
[02:40:57.716 --> 02:41:01.519]  He has connections with very powerful people all over the world.
[02:41:01.519 --> 02:41:03.240]  Who were these people?
[02:41:03.240 --> 02:41:06.423]  Is she referring to Epstein's Orgy Island?
[02:41:06.423 --> 02:41:13.128]  I can tell you that a very reliable source has confirmed to us that Kendall has in fact been trafficked
[02:41:13.849 --> 02:41:22.616]  In 2010, Laura Silsby, former director of the New Life Children's Refuge, was arrested for attempting to traffic 33 children out of Haiti.
[02:41:30.063 --> 02:41:37.486]  Silsby's lawyer and his wife were later arrested on suspicion of involvement in an international human trafficking ring.
[02:41:37.486 --> 02:41:43.568]  Why did Bill Clinton intervene to secure the release of all of Silsby's co-conspirators?
[02:41:43.568 --> 02:41:52.351]  Why did Clinton help get Silsby's sentence reduced from conspiracy and child abduction to just, quote, arranging irregular travel?
[02:41:52.351 --> 02:41:57.573]  Why were Silsby's charges reduced just three days after Clinton landed in Haiti?
[02:41:57.833 --> 02:42:01.314]  Why was Hillary Clinton interested in the case?
[02:42:01.314 --> 02:42:10.357]  Last year, former child actor and Lord of the Rings star Elijah Wood said powerful figures in the movie business were protecting paedophiles.
[02:42:10.357 --> 02:42:14.698]  Who were these monsters that preyed upon children at Hollywood parties?
[02:42:14.898 --> 02:42:22.361]  How many famous faces are among the 100 active pedophiles in Hollywood referenced by Anne Henry?
[02:42:22.361 --> 02:42:28.423]  Are they the same predators who abused Corey Feldman and other child actors in the 1980s?
[02:42:28.423 --> 02:42:33.665]  I can tell you that the number one problem in Hollywood was and is and always will be pedophilia.
[02:42:34.205 --> 02:42:39.468]  There was a circle of older men that surrounded themselves around this group of kids.
[02:42:39.468 --> 02:42:50.513]  Does this Hollywood pedo cult stretch back to the 70s when Roman Polanski was arrested for having sex with a 13-year-old girl before fleeing America?
[02:42:50.513 --> 02:43:00.358]  Why have prominent politicians and Hollywood heavyweights like Meryl Streep consistently defended Polanski, a fugitive pedophile?
[02:43:00.358 --> 02:43:02.539]  Um, yes, uh, Roman Polanski...
[02:43:03.699 --> 02:43:06.521]  I'm very sorry that he's in jail.
[02:43:06.521 --> 02:43:13.747]  In 2012, it was revealed that British entertainer Jimmy Savile had sexually abused hundreds of young children for decades.
[02:43:13.747 --> 02:43:20.071]  Who among those in the British establishment that Savile was so close to knew about his activities?
[02:43:20.071 --> 02:43:26.516]  Who were the other masked participants in Savile's satanic ceremonies during which children were raped?
[02:43:26.776 --> 02:43:34.481]  Who were the other participants during another satanic abuse ceremony that took place on a, quote, wealthy London street?
[02:43:34.481 --> 02:43:44.988]  Why was Savile's connection with what MP Tom Watson called, quote, a powerful paedophile network linked to Parliament and Number 10 not properly investigated?
[02:43:44.988 --> 02:43:55.455]  How come knowledge of Savile's abuse of children was circulating as far back as 1978 and yet he remained free for over three decades?
[02:43:55.455 --> 02:43:56.156]  Jimmy Savile,
[02:43:56.837 --> 02:44:00.084]  I think he's a hypocrite.
[02:44:00.084 --> 02:44:05.657]  I bet he's into all kinds of seediness that we all know about but are not allowed to talk about.
[02:44:07.410 --> 02:44:08.591]  I know some rumours.
[02:44:08.591 --> 02:44:10.152]  I bet none of this will be allowed out.
[02:44:10.152 --> 02:44:25.762]  The fact that in 1978, at the height of the Sex Pistols explosion, there you are, saying about Jimmy Savile, he was into all kinds of seediness that we all knew about, we weren't allowed to talk about it, I know some rumours.
[02:44:25.762 --> 02:44:31.286]  So you had heard the kind of thing that we now know about him, or stuff like that?
[02:44:31.286 --> 02:44:31.746]  Yeah.
[02:44:31.746 --> 02:44:35.069]  I found myself being banned from BBC Radio there for quite a while.
[02:44:35.709 --> 02:44:37.730]  For my contentious behaviour.
[02:44:37.730 --> 02:44:46.852]  Why did the BBC cancel a Newsnight investigation into the abuse that was set to air in 2011 after Savile's death?
[02:44:46.852 --> 02:44:57.454]  Was TV presenter Jill Dando professionally murdered because she was about to expose, quote, big-name stars at the BBC who were involved in the abuse?
[02:44:57.734 --> 02:45:07.357]  Why was an innocent, mentally unstable man blamed for Jill Dando's murder and locked up for seven years on flimsy evidence?
[02:45:07.357 --> 02:45:24.242]  In 2014, London police publicly said they believed allegations that, quote, a ring of prominent politicians and members of the establishment abused and terrorized children as young as seven more than 30 years ago and went on to kill three young boys.
[02:45:24.242 --> 02:45:26.203]  Who were these prominent politicians?
[02:45:26.463 --> 02:45:32.286]  One of the victims who blew the whistle on the abuse handed a list of VIP names to the police.
[02:45:32.286 --> 02:45:34.748]  The allegations beggar belief.
[02:45:34.748 --> 02:45:39.130]  Young boys driven around London and delivered to abuse parties.
[02:45:39.130 --> 02:45:46.274]  MPs, police officers and other pillars of the British establishment engaged in depraved acts of abuse with children.
[02:45:46.274 --> 02:45:48.715]  And now the latest shocking claim.
[02:45:48.715 --> 02:45:52.437]  At least three murders linked to a network of VIP perverts.
[02:45:52.617 --> 02:45:57.880]  An internal Home Office inquiry last year discovered 114 files on the issue had gone missing.
[02:46:02.020 --> 02:46:06.903]  The worst kind of crime committed by the people who are supposed to be running the country.
[02:46:06.903 --> 02:46:16.870]  Why, after initially going public with their belief that the claims were true, did police subsequently close the investigation in 2016?
[02:46:16.870 --> 02:46:28.378]  Was it for the same reason that police shelved an investigation into the same Dolphin Square pedophile cult in 1988 on the orders of those at the top?
[02:46:28.378 --> 02:46:30.079]  And who was the Tory minister
[02:46:30.379 --> 02:46:32.280]  There's been an extremely powerful elite
[02:46:49.368 --> 02:46:49.549]  I think?
[02:47:07.865 --> 02:47:10.326]  And the cover-up and the collusion to prevent that happening.
[02:47:10.326 --> 02:47:17.947]  Pedophile MP Cyril Smith abused boys for four decades and was protected by the British establishment.
[02:47:17.947 --> 02:47:19.627]  Who else are they protecting?
[02:47:19.627 --> 02:47:29.849]  Who protected the Pakistani rape gang that was allowed to abuse and traffic 1,400 girls in Rotherham for over a decade?
[02:47:29.849 --> 02:47:36.870]  In 2004, Belgian Mark Dutroux was convicted of kidnapping, torturing and sexually abusing six young girls
[02:47:37.270 --> 02:47:38.652]  Four of whom he murdered.
[02:47:52.168 --> 02:47:56.229]  Only to claim it was the sound of kids playing outside and then leave?
[02:47:56.229 --> 02:48:06.512]  Why were surveillance tapes showing Dutro constructing the entrance to the dungeon where the kidnapped girls were held, seized by police but never viewed?
[02:48:06.512 --> 02:48:14.234]  Who were the high-level politicians that Dutro named as members of the powerful network he was procuring children for?
[02:48:14.434 --> 02:48:25.780]  Why did Jean-Marc Conorow, the original judge in the case, break down in tears before speaking of shadowy, quote, figures determined to stop the full truth coming out?
[02:48:25.780 --> 02:48:32.563]  Who were the members of the government Conorow said were protecting the real suspects in the trafficking of children?
[02:48:32.563 --> 02:48:36.285]  I don't believe that there is one person in this country who knows the full story.
[02:48:36.465 --> 02:48:45.707]  Were these the same aristocrats involved in the abuse of Annika Lucas and other children in Belgium in the late 60s and early 70s?
[02:48:45.707 --> 02:48:58.110]  And the children were the commodity, the highest, the most valued commodity, and were used for sex mostly.
[02:48:59.821 --> 02:49:08.783]  But there were a number of aristocrats that were part of this club who also liked killing children.
[02:49:09.429 --> 02:49:19.974]  In 2010, numerous prominent individuals in Portugal were convicted for their involvement in the sexual abuse of more than 100 orphan children.
[02:49:19.974 --> 02:49:25.397]  They included a TV presenter, a governor, and a UNESCO ambassador.
[02:49:25.397 --> 02:49:31.740]  Seven people, including a former ambassador and a former television presenter, faced more than 800 charges.
[02:49:31.740 --> 02:49:37.363]  Numerous other senior MPs and members of Portugal's elite were linked to the paedophile ring.
[02:49:37.743 --> 02:49:49.147]  A member of staff from that children's home took boys from there and procured them for pedophiles, for Portuguese men who then took these boys away to other places where they were sexually abused.
[02:49:49.147 --> 02:49:52.328]  Many prominent Portuguese people have been implicated in this case.
[02:49:52.328 --> 02:49:54.729]  Those facts are confirmed by the court.
[02:49:54.729 --> 02:49:56.090]  So crimes were committed.
[02:49:56.090 --> 02:49:56.930]  It's named names.
[02:49:57.090 --> 02:50:02.634]  Carlos Silvino, quote, procured boys for a powerful group of clients.
[02:50:02.634 --> 02:50:03.774]  But who were they?
[02:50:03.774 --> 02:50:13.021]  According to former Secretary of State for Families, Teresa Costa-Makedo, these high-profile pedophiles included diplomats and politicians.
[02:50:13.021 --> 02:50:16.323]  But only a handful of people were ever convicted.
[02:50:16.323 --> 02:50:19.405]  Why were most of them never brought to justice?
[02:50:19.605 --> 02:50:29.170]  And what was the identity of the elitist in France for whom children were provided for sadomasochistic orgies by serial killer Patrice?
[02:50:29.170 --> 02:50:30.651]  All right, we're back live.
[02:50:30.651 --> 02:50:32.192]  The full report has a few minutes left.
[02:50:32.192 --> 02:50:33.752]  It's at Infowars.com.
[02:50:33.752 --> 02:50:35.633]  Video pedophiles rule the world.
[02:50:35.633 --> 02:50:39.675]  This is only part one of a 10-part series of mainstream news coverage.
[02:50:39.675 --> 02:50:48.240]  And you're just getting the conviction sections for you right now of what the media says doesn't exist or Salon says is no big deal.
[02:50:49.249 --> 02:50:57.645]  You see the sexualization of children everywhere, so we're going to be striking back now every day with hardcore data and investigative reports and whistleblowers.
[02:50:57.645 --> 02:50:59.028]  Thanks, Dr. Phil, for being a good guy.

[02:54:33.848 --> 02:54:40.511]  Alright, I'm gonna go to some of your phone calls in a second with the next head of John Rapport coming up.
[02:54:42.918 --> 02:54:45.339]  But listeners say they want us to take on the globalists.
[02:54:45.339 --> 02:54:48.481]  They say they want us to take on the pedophile networks, the satanists.
[02:54:48.481 --> 02:54:49.882]  We're doing it head-on.
[02:54:49.882 --> 02:54:56.746]  And we have got them in an uproar, just full-on gobbling assault of our operation, which is fine.
[02:54:56.746 --> 02:54:57.286]  We expect that.
[02:55:00.652 --> 02:55:03.978]  I feel guilty if I don't do this 24-7, quite frankly.
[02:55:03.978 --> 02:55:07.624]  It's just that I want to be effective and win, so pray for us, support us.
[02:55:07.624 --> 02:55:10.629]  Go read the reviews at m4store.com on the products.
[02:55:14.690 --> 02:55:20.155]  Just on iodine, our nascent iodine, our X2, that's about to sell out.
[02:55:20.155 --> 02:55:21.616]  I love this stuff.
[02:55:21.616 --> 02:55:23.038]  This is Michelle.
[02:55:23.038 --> 02:55:24.119]  I take three drops daily.
[02:55:24.119 --> 02:55:25.900]  I have a slight thyroid issue.
[02:55:25.900 --> 02:55:31.485]  When Dr. Group spoke about how this product is made, I just had to try it out and have used it ever since.
[02:55:31.485 --> 02:55:39.252]  As the time went by, I learned how utterly important iodine is in many other levels, and so I'm happy that I am helping my body and myself.
[02:55:39.252 --> 02:55:39.733]  Five stars.
[02:55:41.348 --> 02:55:45.430]  And again, consult your physician before you take any of this, folks, but it is an element your body has to have.
[02:55:45.430 --> 02:55:48.251]  This is Eric, so consult your physician before you drink water, too.
[02:55:48.251 --> 02:55:53.233]  Better hair and skin complexion, better mental clarity, just three drops a day, so easy.
[02:55:53.233 --> 02:55:55.174]  That's Eric.
[02:55:55.174 --> 02:55:56.474]  There you go.
[02:55:56.474 --> 02:55:57.775]  And Caveman is back in stock.
[02:55:57.775 --> 02:55:59.315]  Okay, let's go to, who's been holding the longest?
[02:55:59.315 --> 02:56:01.576]  We got Joe, a real trooper.
[02:56:01.576 --> 02:56:02.696]  We got Jason in Germany.
[02:56:02.696 --> 02:56:05.558]  Oh, I didn't realize you were holding on your own dime, probably.
[02:56:05.558 --> 02:56:06.998]  Jason first, then Joe.
[02:56:06.998 --> 02:56:08.719]  Jason in Deutschland, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:56:10.990 --> 02:56:13.356]  Hey brother, it's good to be back on with you again.
[02:56:13.356 --> 02:56:16.264]  Real quick, am I still on?
[02:56:16.264 --> 02:56:17.267]  Yes, go ahead sir.
[02:56:17.267 --> 02:56:17.467]  Yes sir.
[02:56:17.921 --> 02:56:19.562]  Okay, cool.
[02:56:19.562 --> 02:56:29.809]  You know, there's so many moving parts to everything that Trump has gone through, and I know that you, in particular, appreciate having complex things distilled down into their most basic essence.
[02:56:29.809 --> 02:56:35.533]  And I believe I have the ability to kind of do that when I analyze all these different things.
[02:56:35.533 --> 02:56:47.381]  Yeah, he can't get his own people in, and they're ignoring him, and then they're going to run PSYOPs against him, where it looks like if he doesn't go after Syria, he's for gassing kids, because he thinks the public doesn't understand false flag attacks, so it's up to us to educate people.
[02:56:47.381 --> 02:56:47.561]  Go ahead.
[02:56:49.022 --> 02:56:49.902]  Well, here's the thing.
[02:56:49.902 --> 02:56:52.764]  It's like everything that's going on right now, everything's a crisis.
[02:56:52.764 --> 02:56:55.485]  Everything is epic, everything is huge.
[02:56:55.485 --> 02:57:02.068]  And I feel like if we're not careful, we're going to run the risk of treating everything like a symptom of the disease rather than treating the disease itself.
[02:57:02.068 --> 02:57:02.988]  No, but don't you agree?
[02:57:02.988 --> 02:57:06.110]  We are in an epic, historic time of global shakeup.
[02:57:06.110 --> 02:57:07.510]  This is one of those times of turmoil.
[02:57:07.510 --> 02:57:09.931]  I'm not just saying this, but sure, sure.
[02:57:09.931 --> 02:57:12.652]  So what's the cause, not the symptom?
[02:57:12.652 --> 02:57:13.733]  I mean, what's the actual disease?
[02:57:15.256 --> 02:57:16.157]  Okay.
[02:57:16.157 --> 02:57:18.718]  Alright, so here's a quick quote from the movie Gladiator.
[02:57:18.718 --> 02:57:24.501]  I think totally sums up the entire thing and outlines the strategy that Trump himself actually needs to take.
[02:57:24.501 --> 02:57:27.603]  It's a conversation between Proximo and Maximus.
[02:57:27.603 --> 02:57:31.225]  Proximo with his trainer, he says, I wasn't the best because I killed quickly.
[02:57:31.225 --> 02:57:34.366]  I was the best because the crowd loved me.
[02:57:34.366 --> 02:57:37.048]  Win the crowd and you will win your freedom.
[02:57:37.048 --> 02:57:42.411]  Maximus says, I will win the crowd and I will give them something they have never seen before.
[02:57:42.851 --> 02:57:47.477]  That, to me, in my mind, perfectly encapsulates where Trump needs to put all of his attention.
[02:57:53.772 --> 02:57:59.115]  Yes, but here's the thing, how is he going to do that?
[02:57:59.115 --> 02:58:02.717]  Like we were talking about, all these different efforts to take him down.
[02:58:02.717 --> 02:58:04.658]  The question came to my mind, who is easier to take down?
[02:58:04.658 --> 02:58:10.061]  Somebody that's a very divisive figure, divisive character, or somebody who's popular?
[02:58:10.061 --> 02:58:16.824]  Right now, Trump is actually at his weakest point because he's so divisive as far as the American public is concerned.
[02:58:16.824 --> 02:58:20.226]  It's really his best defense against all manner of attacks from his enemies.
[02:58:20.766 --> 02:58:21.826]  I don't know what that prop is.
[02:58:51.247 --> 02:58:59.232]  InfoWars has partnered with Defender Body Armor to bring you a new state-of-the-art line of advanced, highly tested body armor from InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:58:59.232 --> 02:59:05.876]  Defender Body Armor is certified to protect against all handgun rounds and even armor-piercing FN 5.7 pistol rounds.
[02:59:05.876 --> 02:59:14.161]  The secret to Defender Body Armor is its proprietary processing technology that disperses more kinetic energy at a rate higher than any other traditional body armor.
[02:59:14.441 --> 02:59:20.310]  Using one of the strongest synthetic materials ever created, called Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene.
[02:59:20.310 --> 02:59:23.474]  Defender armor is also super compact and lightweight.
[02:59:23.474 --> 02:59:29.223]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor.
[02:59:29.543 --> 02:59:30.303]  It works!
[02:59:30.303 --> 02:59:38.627]  Defender Body Armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level Ballistic Resistance Certification from an authorized NIJ Ballistic Laboratory.
[02:59:38.627 --> 02:59:48.512]  Defender Body Armor is now available through InfowarStore.com so you can defend yourself, your family, and finance the Infowar against the Globalists all at the same time!
[02:59:48.512 --> 02:59:53.615]  A total 360 win!
[02:59:53.615 --> 02:59:56.236]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:22.910 --> 03:00:25.551]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:00:25.551 --> 03:00:38.875]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:00:38.875 --> 03:00:40.676]  Joe in California, this is Howard and others.
[03:00:40.676 --> 03:00:42.397]  We're going to your calls right now.
[03:00:42.397 --> 03:00:43.517]  Joe, thanks for holding her on the air.
[03:00:47.057 --> 03:00:49.519]  Oh, good talking with you, Alex.
[03:00:49.519 --> 03:00:53.641]  I'd like to kind of signal against that previous caller.
[03:00:53.641 --> 03:00:56.763]  Trump has already thrown enough bones to these freaking animals.
[03:00:56.763 --> 03:00:59.564]  And it's about time that Trump just glops them.
[03:00:59.564 --> 03:01:01.345]  Just simply ignores them.
[03:01:01.345 --> 03:01:03.207]  Appoint his people by executive order.
[03:01:03.207 --> 03:01:05.528]  We need to get these people in before we're all screwed.
[03:01:07.076 --> 03:01:09.778]  Well, number one, I love what you're saying, I love your voice, and I love your passion.
[03:01:09.778 --> 03:01:10.999]  No, I mean, that's it.
[03:01:10.999 --> 03:01:23.087]  We have to, he has to go on the full offense and be politically incorrect, like a bull in a china shop, and just annihilate all these people, and do fireside chats every night.
[03:01:23.087 --> 03:01:25.789]  Well, the caller hung up, making great points.
[03:01:25.789 --> 03:01:28.371]  Uh, Howard in Florida, Mr. Howard, go ahead.
[03:01:28.371 --> 03:01:30.852]  Good evening!
[03:01:30.852 --> 03:01:32.273]  I mean, sorry, good afternoon, Howard.
[03:01:32.273 --> 03:01:34.195]  God bless you, and Jesus loves you.
[03:01:34.195 --> 03:01:34.635]  Thank you, brother.
[03:01:36.025 --> 03:01:38.647]  And I think we're looking at this wrong here.
[03:01:38.647 --> 03:01:43.090]  In the Bible, Acts chapter 1 verse 8, But ye shall receive power.
[03:01:43.090 --> 03:01:45.252]  That's the Ruach HaKodesh, the Holy Spirit.
[03:01:45.252 --> 03:02:00.203]  Then, here's the key Alex, in Ephesians chapter 6, verse 10, Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, in the power of his might, put on the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.
[03:02:00.843 --> 03:02:06.246]  When we put on the full armor of God, the only weapon we have is the sword and the spear, which is God's Word.
[03:02:06.246 --> 03:02:09.068]  We are fighting a spiritual battle 24-7 with Satan.
[03:02:09.068 --> 03:02:11.689]  He needs a body to infiltrate.
[03:02:11.689 --> 03:02:13.930]  No, I totally agree, and I keep trying to beat the New World Order.
[03:02:13.930 --> 03:02:17.352]  I keep trying to beat the New World Order myself, and I realize I gotta pray more.
[03:02:17.352 --> 03:02:18.453]  That's what takes me out of it.
[03:02:18.453 --> 03:02:20.614]  When I don't, I get, like, dark.
[03:02:20.614 --> 03:02:21.935]  I get twisted.
[03:02:21.935 --> 03:02:22.675]  I make mistakes.
[03:02:22.675 --> 03:02:23.756]  I've gotta just trust in God.
[03:02:25.177 --> 03:02:25.997]  Absolutely!
[03:02:25.997 --> 03:02:30.579]  And Trump doesn't have to blast them to smithereens, he has to hit them with the Word of God!
[03:02:30.579 --> 03:02:32.459]  That's the key!
[03:02:32.459 --> 03:02:35.380]  Notice how they flip out when his wife read the Lord's Prayer.
[03:02:35.380 --> 03:02:37.441]  Notice how they flip out when he says Jesus.
[03:02:37.441 --> 03:02:40.262]  That just like stuns them for days.
[03:02:40.262 --> 03:02:43.083]  Right, because darkness doesn't wait to be shined a light on!
[03:02:43.083 --> 03:02:47.044]  Expose them, Alex, with God's Word!
[03:02:47.044 --> 03:02:49.325]  When he's successful, he quotes the Word of God!
[03:02:51.411 --> 03:02:55.072]  Yeah Alex, I feel like this whole false flag in Syria is just to cause division between us and Russia because if in reality
[03:03:10.996 --> 03:03:22.640]  Why can't Trump just call a press conference, admit we do have Russian ties, and it's our common goal to preserve our sovereignty?
[03:03:22.640 --> 03:03:23.680]  Well, I mean, I agree.
[03:03:23.680 --> 03:03:25.200]  The President's supposed to talk to Russia.
[03:03:25.200 --> 03:03:26.301]  He won't even talk to them now.
[03:03:26.301 --> 03:03:29.282]  He's so paralyzed over, you know, people running.
[03:03:29.282 --> 03:03:33.563]  Nunes has recused himself because, you know, Schiff's running around like, I rule, I rule.
[03:03:33.563 --> 03:03:34.844]  Everybody do what I say.
[03:03:34.844 --> 03:03:36.424]  Everyone's a Russian agent but me.
[03:03:36.424 --> 03:03:38.625]  You know, it's like a bunch of Muppets or something.
[03:03:38.625 --> 03:03:39.285]  It's just crazy.
[03:03:41.363 --> 03:03:45.525]  As I said earlier, they want to attack Christians because we have a soft heart.
[03:03:45.525 --> 03:03:49.947]  Well, before you attack my children, you better look in my callous hands.
[03:03:49.947 --> 03:03:59.532]  Because I may have a soft heart, but when it comes to these children that I raise, my heart has no bearing on what's going to happen.
[03:03:59.532 --> 03:04:01.413]  And I'll tell you something else.
[03:04:01.413 --> 03:04:08.257]  If Russia and America stand together, you take these soft-ass leaders like North Korea
[03:04:09.180 --> 03:04:13.303]  And they want to launch rockets at our allies.
[03:04:13.303 --> 03:04:16.345]  You know, there's a reason why China's not doing that.
[03:04:16.345 --> 03:04:23.870]  They've got this joke, soft, feminine-looking man over there shooting these rockets everywhere.
[03:04:23.870 --> 03:04:27.312]  There's a reason they've got him doing it.
[03:04:27.312 --> 03:04:34.697]  I'm not going to go any further with that because I don't want to offend too many people, but I just feel like it's time.
[03:04:35.954 --> 03:04:44.418]  Maybe we need to help keep Assad in and expose the false flag and then call on Russia to stand with us and let's go ahead.
[03:04:44.418 --> 03:04:44.838]  Absolutely.
[03:04:44.838 --> 03:04:50.941]  I think Trump should have a press conference with Putin and just sit there and say, we're not supposed to work with other countries and just literally shake his hand.
[03:04:50.941 --> 03:04:51.681]  That's ridiculous.
[03:04:51.681 --> 03:04:55.903]  He needs to get out in front of it instead of letting the BS be dictated to him.
[03:04:55.903 --> 03:04:56.203]  All right.
[03:04:56.203 --> 03:04:56.663]  Thank you, Jimmy.
[03:04:56.663 --> 03:04:59.365]  I'm going to come introduce this segment with John Rutherford.
[03:04:59.365 --> 03:04:59.825]  Stay with us.
[03:05:01.124 --> 03:05:06.508]  Corey Lewandowski, Paul Manafort, Mike Flynn, Steve Bannon, and now Devin Nunes.
[03:05:06.508 --> 03:05:09.750]  It seems the left's intimidation tactics are actually working.
[03:05:09.750 --> 03:05:17.916]  Nunes is the latest to be asked to step aside after an intense few weeks of grilling from the left, as the House Intelligence Chairman has now recused himself from the Russian probe.
[03:05:17.916 --> 03:05:20.058]  Isn't that too convenient for the Democrats?
[03:05:20.058 --> 03:05:26.202]  To have the only one involved in this Russian probe who actually seems to care about the truth of the matter step aside and recuse himself.
[03:05:26.202 --> 03:05:27.363]  Just to rub our noses in it,
[03:05:27.543 --> 03:05:37.369]  Representative Adam Schiff, Democrat member of the House Intelligence Committee, made a public statement moments after Nunes' announcement saying how pleased he was to hear of Nunes' recusal.
[03:05:37.369 --> 03:05:41.712]  So now, the Democrats have a monopoly on the political witch hunt that is the Russian probe.
[03:05:41.712 --> 03:05:42.612]  Thanks, Nunes.
[03:05:42.612 --> 03:05:46.255]  The Republicans have gotten their leverage democratically and refuse to use it.
[03:05:46.255 --> 03:05:49.917]  The Democrats get their leverage with smear campaigns and use it successfully.
[03:05:50.197 --> 03:05:53.419]  And if we keep allowing them to do it, they're going to continue.
[03:05:53.419 --> 03:05:56.141]  President Trump, the swamp is draining us.
[03:05:56.141 --> 03:05:59.803]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.
[03:05:59.803 --> 03:06:04.246]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[03:06:04.246 --> 03:06:05.407]  They lost.
[03:06:05.407 --> 03:06:05.807]  We won.
[03:06:05.807 --> 03:06:09.229]  Wanna see what Trump's up against?
[03:06:09.229 --> 03:06:14.093]  Because of what we did on this day, change has come to America.
[03:06:16.750 --> 03:06:22.597]  The nation has been hijacked by international forces, bent on global governance.
[03:06:22.597 --> 03:06:28.724]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie.
[03:06:28.724 --> 03:06:35.031]  God was in school, morality had a future, and beef was for supper.
[03:06:35.031 --> 03:06:37.494]  Revelation, dawn of global government.
[03:06:37.734 --> 03:06:38.915]  We're the solution!
[03:06:38.915 --> 03:06:39.895]  Americans!
[03:06:39.895 --> 03:06:41.436]  Ain't nothing more to it than that.
[03:06:41.436 --> 03:06:46.800]  Starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, and Special Ops General Jerry Boykin.
[03:06:46.800 --> 03:06:48.481]  Theatrical screening's on demand.
[03:06:48.481 --> 03:06:50.442]  DVD's now available.
[03:06:50.442 --> 03:06:53.825]  Wanna shed some tears over the red, white, and blue?
[03:06:53.825 --> 03:06:56.026]  Americans need to see this film.
[03:07:01.940 --> 03:07:07.444]  The reason InfoWarsLive has five-star ratings on major third-party sites is because I want products I'm gonna use for my family.
[03:07:07.444 --> 03:07:08.284]  I take this.
[03:07:08.284 --> 03:07:09.405]  My family takes this.
[03:07:09.405 --> 03:07:13.708]  And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're gonna find anywhere.
[03:07:13.708 --> 03:07:18.151]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLive.com.
[03:07:18.291 --> 03:07:22.933]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference.
[03:07:22.933 --> 03:07:24.074]  I don't feel good.
[03:07:24.074 --> 03:07:27.815]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[03:07:27.815 --> 03:07:30.516]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[03:07:30.516 --> 03:07:36.319]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[03:07:36.319 --> 03:07:39.280]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[03:07:39.280 --> 03:07:42.802]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[03:07:42.802 --> 03:07:45.043]  So, obviously, the Super Female is amazing.
[03:07:45.043 --> 03:07:45.403]  I love it.
[03:07:45.563 --> 03:07:48.367]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[03:07:48.367 --> 03:07:49.388]  Survival Shield X2.
[03:07:49.388 --> 03:07:55.195]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[03:07:55.195 --> 03:07:57.218]  It's got a five-star rating.
[03:07:57.218 --> 03:07:59.421]  It's a win-win in fullwarslife.com.
[03:08:14.298 --> 03:08:15.439]  Big Brother.
[03:08:15.439 --> 03:08:17.220]  Mainstream media.
[03:08:17.220 --> 03:08:19.161]  Government cover-ups.
[03:08:19.161 --> 03:08:20.843]  You want to stop tyranny?
[03:08:20.843 --> 03:08:22.484]  Well, so does he.
[03:08:22.484 --> 03:08:27.447]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:08:27.447 --> 03:08:32.431]  Well, they're saying the vote could be as early as today for Gorsuch, and then I guess he'll be confirmed all officially tomorrow.
[03:08:34.116 --> 03:08:45.425]  I'm really disappointed with this false flag attack that Ron Paul is exposing, that we exposed first, and the fact that the rebels have been caught many times staging false flags, and have been caught red-handed, like, admittedly doing it.
[03:08:45.425 --> 03:08:46.426]  This is so ridiculous.
[03:08:46.426 --> 03:08:48.548]  Assad's winning.
[03:08:48.548 --> 03:08:52.691]  Tillerson comes out and says, maybe we'll leave Assad in power, let him have elections.
[03:08:52.691 --> 03:08:57.055]  They start agreeing with the Russians to stabilize the region, not turn it over to Al-Qaeda.
[03:08:57.055 --> 03:08:57.916]  That's what ISIS is.
[03:08:57.916 --> 03:09:02.499]  And there's a chemical attack, and there's these witnesses that are then known PR agents of CNN.
[03:09:04.121 --> 03:09:09.443]  This is just like saying babies were thrown out of incubators in 1990 in Desert Shield.
[03:09:09.443 --> 03:09:12.844]  It's crazy to see this unfolding.
[03:09:12.844 --> 03:09:15.285]  And you've got all this nuclear war talk going on.
[03:09:15.285 --> 03:09:16.766]  It is just wild.
[03:09:16.766 --> 03:09:21.548]  Leaked doc show how Soros spent big to defeat populist candidates in Europe.
[03:09:21.548 --> 03:09:23.489]  He's doing it here.
[03:09:23.489 --> 03:09:26.930]  It's like, who are these crazy people and why do we have to put up with them?
[03:09:26.930 --> 03:09:29.991]  So that's all coming up.
[03:09:29.991 --> 03:09:31.372]  And we've got those clips now.
[03:09:32.987 --> 03:09:35.791]  John Rutherford of nomorefakenews.com is going to be hosting this hour.
[03:09:35.791 --> 03:09:38.874]  I'm sorry to the other callers, I didn't have time to get to you, but I got to most of you.
[03:09:40.148 --> 03:09:47.010]  So we'll go ahead and let those callers go, but we have calls all across the map, but I'll be back tomorrow and so will David Knight at 11 a.m.
[03:09:47.010 --> 03:09:47.590]  to 3 p.m.
[03:09:47.590 --> 03:09:56.833]  with the Chinese communist dictator known as the President, and we'll have the Gorsuch information and so much more, but this is definitely a very interesting time to be alive.
[03:09:56.833 --> 03:10:07.176]  I hope that listeners will support us and realize that we have amazing products, whether it's water filtration systems that MSM makes fun of that we sell the highest rated gravity-fed filters in the country out there,
[03:10:08.636 --> 03:10:11.778]  I know that they are also, you know, upset that we sell fluoride-free toothpaste.
[03:10:11.778 --> 03:10:14.499]  It's high quality with coiled silver and iodine in it.
[03:10:14.499 --> 03:10:15.360]  The adults sold out.
[03:10:15.360 --> 03:10:17.561]  We have the children's bubblegum flavor right now.
[03:10:18.464 --> 03:10:25.867]  I know they're upset that, you know, we're explaining how iodine is so key and the good halogen and the bad halogens are really hammering us.
[03:10:25.867 --> 03:10:27.007]  And suddenly it's all over the news.
[03:10:27.007 --> 03:10:27.728]  Everybody knows it.
[03:10:27.728 --> 03:10:29.908]  And all these new iodine supplements are coming out.
[03:10:29.908 --> 03:10:31.149]  It's just the biggest rage in the world.
[03:10:31.149 --> 03:10:33.990]  And Israel comes out and says, oh, my God, we've got to give our public iodine.
[03:10:33.990 --> 03:10:35.991]  And, you know, we're just being proven right over and over again.
[03:10:35.991 --> 03:10:37.371]  We're just such horrible people.
[03:10:37.371 --> 03:10:45.094]  Caveman, our paleo formula with the bone broth and the turmeric and so much more bee pollen, chaga mushroom is now back in stock.
[03:10:45.094 --> 03:10:46.735]  And your purchases are vital.
[03:10:47.375 --> 03:10:48.395]  To everything we do.
[03:10:48.395 --> 03:10:55.658]  We also have the Trump is my President shirt just to meet like-minded people and to trigger the anti-free speech fake leftists.
[03:10:55.658 --> 03:10:58.259]  It says Infowars.com on the back.
[03:10:58.259 --> 03:10:59.500]  Trump of course has already faltered.
[03:10:59.500 --> 03:11:05.962]  I expected him to falter more than this almost 80 days in, but it was not a lot of faltering until now and now it's substantive.
[03:11:05.962 --> 03:11:06.442]  It doesn't matter.
[03:11:06.442 --> 03:11:09.803]  It's all about promoting the idea of nationalism.
[03:11:09.803 --> 03:11:12.244]  That's why they'll never rest until he's destroyed.
[03:11:12.244 --> 03:11:13.685]  That's why he can't ever capitulate.
[03:11:14.991 --> 03:11:17.573]  Because notice he says, okay, maybe Syria did do this.
[03:11:17.573 --> 03:11:20.095]  I mean, told us by my Joint Chiefs, this is terrible.
[03:11:20.095 --> 03:11:21.977]  And they go, oh, it's your fault, Syria.
[03:11:21.977 --> 03:11:24.058]  And Obamacare's your fault.
[03:11:24.058 --> 03:11:25.960]  The sinking of the Titanic's your fault.
[03:11:25.960 --> 03:11:27.281]  They want to destroy nationalism.
[03:11:27.281 --> 03:11:31.645]  So we'll get John Rappaport of nomorefakenews.com, investigative journalist, take
[03:11:32.875 --> 03:11:37.801]  We'll get his take on the state of the world and how he thinks we can arrest the ship.
[03:11:37.801 --> 03:11:44.950]  We've already had huge victories against political correctness, globalism is spreading across the world, but the globalists admit they want to stop Trump here.
[03:11:46.305 --> 03:11:48.226]  And they think it'll cause a domino effect the other way.
[03:11:48.226 --> 03:11:49.607]  Well, good luck.
[03:11:49.607 --> 03:11:55.050]  And of course, they're also racing in their power trips, their arrogance, their bravado, their chutzpah to start a world war.
[03:11:55.050 --> 03:11:56.871]  So all that and more right now.
[03:11:56.871 --> 03:11:59.713]  But Rand Paul urges Trump not to take military action in Syria.
[03:11:59.713 --> 03:12:01.334]  That's on Infowars.com.
[03:12:01.334 --> 03:12:04.036]  I want to thank all our listeners and viewers for your support, your prayers.
[03:12:04.036 --> 03:12:05.837]  But now, more than ever,
[03:12:07.026 --> 03:12:17.394]  Is the time to spread the word about InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and all the other great sites like NoMoreFakeNews.com because we are all in this together.
[03:12:17.394 --> 03:12:20.016]  John Rutherford, take over my friend, good to see you.
[03:12:20.016 --> 03:12:23.318]  Thank you Alex, good to see you.
[03:12:23.318 --> 03:12:31.645]  As I wrote many months ago, and other people have joined in on this, Trump has to get out in front.
[03:12:33.004 --> 03:12:35.105]  As Alex was just saying.
[03:12:35.105 --> 03:12:38.045]  Fireside chats every night.
[03:12:38.045 --> 03:12:39.826]  His own web channel.
[03:12:39.826 --> 03:12:42.766]  Stream it live.
[03:12:42.766 --> 03:12:46.387]  Talk to the world, not just America.
[03:12:46.387 --> 03:12:47.988]  Explain what's happening.
[03:12:47.988 --> 03:12:54.329]  Explain why he is not going to capitulate.
[03:12:54.329 --> 03:12:58.170]  Explain why there is going to be no U.S.
[03:12:58.170 --> 03:13:00.430]  war in Syria.
[03:13:00.430 --> 03:13:01.911]  Get that out of your head.
[03:13:02.870 --> 03:13:08.257]  Mr. President, get that out of your head now.
[03:13:08.257 --> 03:13:10.160]  Cooperating with Russia?
[03:13:10.160 --> 03:13:11.963]  So what?
[03:13:11.963 --> 03:13:14.887]  If it's in a good cause, as in this case?
[03:13:16.195 --> 03:13:17.535]  We know from documents.
[03:13:17.535 --> 03:13:19.016]  We know from reports.
[03:13:19.016 --> 03:13:21.136]  We know what happened in Benghazi.
[03:13:21.136 --> 03:13:36.340]  We know Libya was a staging platform for weapons to go to the Syrian rebels, meaning terrorists, supported, created, funded by the US and other allies.
[03:13:36.340 --> 03:13:37.981]  This is all on the table.
[03:13:37.981 --> 03:13:39.561]  It's been on the table for a long time.
[03:13:41.571 --> 03:13:46.792]  The whole idea here is that the neocons and globalists want a war in Syria.
[03:13:46.792 --> 03:13:48.133]  That they want endless war.
[03:13:48.133 --> 03:13:51.053]  They want endless destabilization.
[03:13:51.053 --> 03:13:54.914]  Because it enables them to weaken populations and take over.
[03:13:54.914 --> 03:13:56.515]  It's pretty simple, folks.
[03:13:56.515 --> 03:14:01.996]  I mean, this is not, you know, something you need a PhD in to understand.
[03:14:03.118 --> 03:14:08.242]  Let's say we want to control this population, so we need to destroy it first.
[03:14:08.242 --> 03:14:12.485]  Okay, so we have these countries in the Middle East, Africa, and so forth.
[03:14:12.485 --> 03:14:15.608]  So we have to completely ruin them.
[03:14:15.608 --> 03:14:19.871]  We have to cause widespread chaos.
[03:14:19.871 --> 03:14:24.595]  Chaos is our friend.
[03:14:24.595 --> 03:14:26.876]  That's how these people think.
[03:14:26.876 --> 03:14:32.741]  And there's deeper psychological and spiritual reasons, of course, behind all that.
[03:14:33.567 --> 03:14:35.968]  But that's what's going on.
[03:14:35.968 --> 03:14:55.674]  And if Trump is too dim to understand what's happening and realize that he has to get out in front of all of this and say, this is what we're going to do and this is what we're not going to do, then he is going to go down the tubes.
[03:14:55.674 --> 03:14:57.935]  He is going to go down the tubes.
[03:14:57.935 --> 03:15:00.596]  It's one thing to be isolating and
[03:15:03.447 --> 03:15:07.909]  Discovering exactly where terrorists are and dealing with that.
[03:15:07.909 --> 03:15:15.972]  It's another thing to go back to the old formula of launching wars, massive attacks, etc, etc.
[03:15:18.090 --> 03:15:25.817]  And taking out the country that was invaded by the globalists, as you just said, they're never going to let Trump... I mean, do you agree, John, just popping in?
[03:15:25.817 --> 03:15:28.860]  They're never even going to let him capitulate to the globalists.
[03:15:28.860 --> 03:15:29.681]  They're going to destroy him.
[03:15:29.681 --> 03:15:32.824]  They're not going to let him have his agenda of productivity and freedom.
[03:15:32.824 --> 03:15:34.386]  They're going to kill it all.
[03:15:34.386 --> 03:15:34.986]  Yeah.
[03:15:34.986 --> 03:15:37.468]  They're going to go after him on every possible front.
[03:15:38.547 --> 03:15:53.982]  They're going to say, basically, if you are Trump, or a Trump associate, or anybody who knows Trump, or ever knew Trump, and you ever talked on the phone to a foreign official, that's called collusion.
[03:15:53.982 --> 03:15:55.903]  I mean, that's how insane they've gotten now.
[03:15:57.299 --> 03:16:11.802]  In the echo chamber of MSN, they're trying to convince the American public that any conversation that any Trump associate ever had with any foreign leader or official means collusion, anti-America.
[03:16:11.802 --> 03:16:15.763]  Bare minimum, that paralyzes the administration where they can't talk to anybody.
[03:16:15.763 --> 03:16:17.243]  Yeah, of course.
[03:16:17.243 --> 03:16:18.844]  It's their job to talk to people.
[03:16:18.844 --> 03:16:21.364]  That's what they do.
[03:16:21.364 --> 03:16:24.885]  I remember, it must have been almost a year ago now, maybe a little less,
[03:16:26.483 --> 03:16:29.787]  I wrote, look Trump, just get on the phone with Putin.
[03:16:29.787 --> 03:16:31.829]  Just get on the phone.
[03:16:31.829 --> 03:16:33.851]  Or go see him, or have him come over here.
[03:16:33.851 --> 03:16:36.133]  That's right, do it in public, demystify it.
[03:16:36.133 --> 03:16:37.555]  Big deal, I'm calling him.
[03:16:37.555 --> 03:16:39.377]  Yeah, tomorrow.
[03:16:39.377 --> 03:16:40.178]  Get on a plane.
[03:16:41.018 --> 03:16:51.721]  We don't have to have any diplomatic arrangements and, you know, all the hangers-on and the people who don't matter, whose jobs are all about deciding which tea they're going to drink.
[03:16:51.721 --> 03:16:53.901]  Because the American people elected Trump.
[03:16:53.901 --> 03:16:56.242]  He's supposed to do this.
[03:16:56.242 --> 03:16:56.962]  And so I agree.
[03:16:56.962 --> 03:17:04.204]  Trump has got to meet with Putin publicly and demystify it and break the will of these disinfo operatives now.
[03:17:04.946 --> 03:17:06.146]  Exactly.
[03:17:06.146 --> 03:17:09.308]  Sit out there in the Rose Garden and have a conversation.
[03:17:09.308 --> 03:17:11.469]  Stream it live to the world.
[03:17:11.469 --> 03:17:14.810]  Sit there and talk for a couple of hours.
[03:17:14.810 --> 03:17:15.950]  Hash it all out.
[03:17:15.950 --> 03:17:17.991]  What is all this about?
[03:17:17.991 --> 03:17:18.571]  That's key!
[03:17:18.571 --> 03:17:23.093]  It should be public broadcast, worldwide, over the internet, exactly.
[03:17:23.093 --> 03:17:23.834]  Just live.
[03:17:23.834 --> 03:17:26.815]  Talk for an hour and a half.
[03:17:26.815 --> 03:17:29.116]  It'll take an hour of questions.
[03:17:29.116 --> 03:17:30.976]  Sure, absolutely.
[03:17:30.976 --> 03:17:32.317]  You know Putin is going to say,
[03:17:33.533 --> 03:17:36.838]  You know, I don't even understand what's going on over here in America.
[03:17:36.838 --> 03:17:40.603]  I mean, which Syrian war are you thinking about?
[03:17:40.603 --> 03:17:42.906]  Because what we want to do is to stop all that.
[03:17:43.766 --> 03:17:51.948]  We know these people who claim to be rebels are actually, you know, funded by you and by your allies.
[03:17:51.948 --> 03:17:53.829]  We understand how all this has happened.
[03:17:53.829 --> 03:17:55.369]  Everybody knows this by now.
[03:17:55.369 --> 03:17:58.770]  So let's just cut the crap and let's get down to it.
[03:17:58.770 --> 03:18:00.771]  We don't want a war in Syria.
[03:18:00.771 --> 03:18:03.072]  You said you don't want a war in Syria.
[03:18:03.072 --> 03:18:09.033]  So let's cooperate and let's stop all of these neocons who want to destroy countries.
[03:18:09.033 --> 03:18:10.614]  You know, he's going to say something like that.
[03:18:11.343 --> 03:18:14.244]  So then the ball's in Trump's court.
[03:18:14.244 --> 03:18:16.866]  Well, what about the chemical attacks and so forth?
[03:18:16.866 --> 03:18:19.487]  Well, do you really believe, Mr. President?
[03:18:19.487 --> 03:18:37.515]  Do you really believe that as we were, Russia and the U.S., moving toward creating a situation of peace in Syria, making progress, that Assad was going to suddenly launch a chemical attack so that the whole thing would fall apart?
[03:18:38.416 --> 03:18:40.337]  I mean, that would be destroying himself.
[03:18:40.337 --> 03:18:41.938]  That would be self-sabotage.
[03:18:41.938 --> 03:18:43.639]  So we know it was a false flag.
[03:18:43.639 --> 03:18:45.820]  We know that it was a put-up job.

[03:18:57.447 --> 03:19:05.211]  You know, and then he gets on the offensive and he says, OK, look, you know, we got a few bones to pick, too, and here's what they are.
[03:19:05.211 --> 03:19:06.692]  Hash it all out in the open.

[03:21:48.725 --> 03:21:52.148]  Click the orange star in the upper right corner and enter secret code 3333.
[03:21:52.148 --> 03:21:54.109]  That's PersonalCreations.com.
[03:21:54.109 --> 03:21:55.691]  Click the star and enter secret code 3333.
[03:21:55.691 --> 03:21:56.211]  PersonalCreations.com. 3333.
[03:22:00.134 --> 03:22:10.982]  What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality, feeling better than you have in years, and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns, blood sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?
[03:22:10.982 --> 03:22:15.145]  There's something that is changing thousands of people's lives, and you could be one of them.
[03:22:15.145 --> 03:22:17.306]  It's called Heart and Body Extract.
[03:22:17.306 --> 03:22:22.750]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract, talks about the positive effects of Heart and Body Extract.
[03:22:22.910 --> 03:22:32.899]  What happens with the formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.
[03:22:32.899 --> 03:22:39.385]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries.
[03:22:39.385 --> 03:22:42.687]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetics.
[03:22:42.687 --> 03:22:44.769]  So the body is an amazing thing.
[03:22:44.769 --> 03:22:47.872]  It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.
[03:22:47.892 --> 03:22:49.433]  They say you can't take on the man and win.
[03:22:49.433 --> 03:22:55.215]  That one small company doesn't stand a chance against the corporate behemoths with all their money and lawyers.
[03:22:55.215 --> 03:22:55.975]  But they don't know Harry's.
[03:23:08.780 --> 03:23:10.100]  How's Harry's done it?
[03:23:10.100 --> 03:23:10.860]  Simple.
[03:23:10.860 --> 03:23:13.801]  By owning the factory and selling directly to you.
[03:23:13.801 --> 03:23:16.522]  Harry's sells their incredible razor blades online.
[03:23:16.522 --> 03:23:18.642]  They ship directly from their site to you.
[03:23:18.642 --> 03:23:20.362]  And do it for a lot less.
[03:23:20.362 --> 03:23:25.443]  And while those other guys rake in huge profits, Harry's passes the savings directly back to you.
[03:23:25.443 --> 03:23:26.323]  The result?
[03:23:26.323 --> 03:23:29.584]  A quality shave and more money in your pocket.
[03:23:29.584 --> 03:23:30.464]  Don't believe it?
[03:23:30.464 --> 03:23:31.764]  Try Harry's for yourself.
[03:23:31.764 --> 03:23:32.425]  For free.
[03:23:32.425 --> 03:23:34.285]  Just pay three bucks in shipping when you sign up.
[03:23:34.685 --> 03:23:39.528]  Your set comes with a razor, shave gel, travel cover, and a post-shave balm.
[03:23:39.528 --> 03:23:41.949]  That's an almost $20 value, free.
[03:23:41.949 --> 03:23:43.911]  There's no catch and no commitment.
[03:23:43.911 --> 03:23:45.772]  You can cancel anytime.
[03:23:45.772 --> 03:23:48.173]  And quality is always guaranteed.
[03:23:48.173 --> 03:23:53.236]  So go to Harrys.com now and enter code 5000 at checkout.
[03:23:53.236 --> 03:23:54.937]  That's Harrys.com, code 5000.
[03:23:54.937 --> 03:23:55.397]  Again, 5000.
[03:24:01.249 --> 03:24:04.010]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[03:24:04.010 --> 03:24:11.451]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:24:11.451 --> 03:24:14.952]  John Rappaport here in the fourth hour on InfoWars.
[03:24:14.952 --> 03:24:17.332]  Let me just talk a little about Caveman.
[03:24:17.332 --> 03:24:18.713]  I like the name of that product.
[03:24:18.713 --> 03:24:21.853]  It's been sold out for weeks.
[03:24:21.853 --> 03:24:24.214]  It's there at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:24:24.214 --> 03:24:24.374]  33% off.
[03:24:31.036 --> 03:24:32.657]  If you order now.
[03:24:32.657 --> 03:24:33.838]  Bone broth.
[03:24:33.838 --> 03:24:37.200]  Seven different primal superfoods.
[03:24:37.200 --> 03:24:40.242]  Unique formulation behind caveman.
[03:24:40.242 --> 03:24:46.286]  Turmeric root, shaga mushrooms, bee pollen, and bone broth.
[03:24:46.286 --> 03:24:48.708]  Ultimate in paleo nutrition.
[03:24:50.116 --> 03:25:02.602]  So this product sells out, it comes back eventually, but it's there right now and you should get it right now at InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:25:02.602 --> 03:25:07.085]  33 off because it's going to sell out again.
[03:25:07.085 --> 03:25:08.705]  Caveman.
[03:25:08.705 --> 03:25:11.447]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:25:11.447 --> 03:25:14.808]  And as you know, as Alex says, 360Win.
[03:25:16.974 --> 03:25:19.054]  You buy a great product for your health.
[03:25:19.054 --> 03:25:21.235]  You support InfoWars.
[03:25:21.235 --> 03:25:28.217]  You support all independent media in the fight for basically freedom.
[03:25:28.217 --> 03:25:30.677]  That's what we're talking about here.
[03:25:30.677 --> 03:25:33.158]  We're also talking about the media.
[03:25:33.158 --> 03:25:39.299]  I'm going to just get rid of a few stories that I was going to talk about because let's get down to brass tacks here.
[03:25:41.744 --> 03:26:02.678]  16, 17, whatever it is now, years ago, I called this my site, nomorefakenews.com, because I'd already been working as a reporter since 1982, and it was apparent to me that we were up against a massive, massive force in major media news, because they were lying all the time.
[03:26:03.533 --> 03:26:20.375]  This was exposed to me when I began doing deep medical investigations and I saw the incredible criminality, medical drugs destroying lives, killing people in huge numbers, stories going unreported in the press, but it was more than that and it's more than that now.
[03:26:22.114 --> 03:26:45.961]  So what you're getting from independent media now is we are going directly around, through, over major media, and we're presenting you with the stories as they actually are, and the reasons why they are, and the shakers and movers behind the scenes, the globalists who want to transform the planet into their version of slavery.
[03:26:47.267 --> 03:26:57.310]  You're not going to get that on the nightly news with Scott Paley at CBS or anybody else in the mainstream because they're covering all that up.
[03:26:57.310 --> 03:26:59.150]  Oh, well, you see, the story is this way.
[03:26:59.150 --> 03:27:03.612]  And so she was saying and then he was saying, and now we bring on a guest who says this.
[03:27:03.612 --> 03:27:05.272]  And so it's very complicated.
[03:27:05.272 --> 03:27:07.273]  And the two sides are bickering and so forth.
[03:27:07.273 --> 03:27:09.673]  And this does not look good for the president.
[03:27:12.914 --> 03:27:13.875]  And, you know, what do you got?
[03:27:13.875 --> 03:27:14.595]  You got nothing.
[03:27:14.595 --> 03:27:24.780]  When you break it apart in your hands, it's like, you know, some machine-made white bread that just crumbles and you're looking at it and you're saying, I was going to eat that stuff?
[03:27:24.780 --> 03:27:26.101]  No.
[03:27:26.101 --> 03:27:33.584]  A direct frontal attack to destroy the credibility of mainstream news.
[03:27:33.584 --> 03:27:36.466]  As number one on the agenda.
[03:27:37.492 --> 03:27:43.718]  Because if they're the eyes and ears and mouth and brain of the public, then how's the public ever going to wake up?
[03:27:43.718 --> 03:27:47.061]  So this war has been going on for a long time now.
[03:27:47.061 --> 03:27:48.923]  And it's accelerating.
[03:27:48.923 --> 03:27:53.568]  And Trump can do something about it if he has the wherewithal.
[03:27:54.793 --> 03:28:02.796]  If he can get his brain together on the simplicities of what he spoke about in the campaign.
[03:28:02.796 --> 03:28:04.096]  Ending globalism.
[03:28:04.096 --> 03:28:05.457]  Ending the trade treaties.
[03:28:05.457 --> 03:28:07.998]  Bringing jobs back to America.
[03:28:07.998 --> 03:28:11.059]  Not letting jobs leave America.
[03:28:11.059 --> 03:28:13.500]  No foreign wars.
[03:28:13.500 --> 03:28:16.141]  Bring troops home.
[03:28:16.141 --> 03:28:22.043]  Show the people that there is no need to do anything except defend America.
[03:28:23.154 --> 03:28:25.155]  That's the point.
[03:28:25.155 --> 03:28:29.336]  Get back to the basics and the simplicities.
[03:28:29.336 --> 03:28:39.738]  If there are unlimited numbers of people coming across the border, and they're unregulated and unvetted, and they just come through, where's the ceiling on that?
[03:28:39.738 --> 03:28:46.600]  Somebody tell me the upside number when everybody will agree, OK, that's all, that's it.
[03:28:46.600 --> 03:28:49.661]  You're never going to get that from so-called liberal media.
[03:28:51.946 --> 03:29:01.275]  Well, there is no limit, because we're kind, we're good, we love everybody, and so we want to have 50 million, 100 million more people just come across the borders.
[03:29:01.275 --> 03:29:11.084]  We don't care what condition they're in, or who they are, or what they want to do here, whether they want to accept America, or whether they hate America, and they're going to commit heinous crimes.
[03:29:11.144 --> 03:29:12.065]  Fine, no problem.
[03:29:12.065 --> 03:29:13.326]  Let Trump get out in front of all that now.
[03:29:30.037 --> 03:29:40.123]  With his own web channel, and talk about these basics every day, and hammer it home, and get past all this echo chamber of the media.
[03:29:40.123 --> 03:29:48.928]  That's what he needs to do, and he better wake up to that, because that's what the people who elected him want him to do.
[03:29:48.928 --> 03:29:50.109]  We'll be back.
[03:29:50.109 --> 03:29:54.031]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:54.031 --> 03:29:56.733]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.243 --> 03:30:06.349]  While the swamp is competitive in the political battle, it does seem the cultural swamp is being drained.
[03:30:06.349 --> 03:30:11.875]  Shia LaBeouf's most recent film, Man Down, had a blockbuster opening day with a huge ticket sale.
[03:30:11.875 --> 03:30:13.177]  Yes, one ticket.
[03:30:13.177 --> 03:30:17.001]  Since opening night last weekend, ticket sales have totaled a whopping three.
[03:30:17.001 --> 03:30:19.044]  He's had more flags stolen than ticket sales.
[03:30:19.304 --> 03:30:23.767]  So Shia's childish antics on the streets earned him more attention than his actual job.
[03:30:23.767 --> 03:30:28.471]  Meanwhile, InStyle Magazine had to publish a story to boost Amy Schumer's crushed ego.
[03:30:28.471 --> 03:30:32.694]  Headline reading, So now, if a man doesn't like a woman, it's because he's sexist.
[03:30:36.437 --> 03:30:41.861]  How dare you not like my strong, proud woman who breaks all the social paradigms by trying to be elegant and abhorrent at the same time.
[03:30:41.861 --> 03:30:42.141]  See?
[03:30:42.141 --> 03:30:43.842]  Women can do and be anything.
[03:30:43.842 --> 03:30:45.443]  Yes, including too vulgar.
[03:30:45.443 --> 03:30:50.046]  I ran a series of polls on Twitter called Who's the Worst, and Amy Schumer won.
[03:30:50.046 --> 03:30:51.087]  The people have spoken.
[03:30:51.087 --> 03:30:52.728]  Amy Schumer is the worst.
[03:30:52.728 --> 03:30:55.870]  But if the left wants her to be their poster child, go ahead.
[03:30:55.870 --> 03:30:57.651]  We will keep winning the culture war.
[03:30:57.651 --> 03:31:00.013]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroyer.
[03:31:00.973 --> 03:31:02.854]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[03:31:02.854 --> 03:31:04.894]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[03:31:04.894 --> 03:31:07.776]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[03:31:07.776 --> 03:31:13.858]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[03:31:13.858 --> 03:31:23.041]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breathe.
[03:31:23.041 --> 03:31:27.903]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children.
[03:31:28.123 --> 03:31:30.565]  Do the best job you can to purify your air.
[03:31:30.565 --> 03:31:38.593]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[03:31:38.593 --> 03:31:39.694]  The general public doesn't.
[03:31:40.780 --> 03:31:44.161]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[03:31:44.161 --> 03:31:48.282]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[03:31:48.282 --> 03:31:55.004]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[03:31:55.004 --> 03:31:59.085]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at m4warstore.com.
[03:32:01.846 --> 03:32:03.427]  This is Alex Jones.
[03:32:03.427 --> 03:32:09.310]  I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money on one of the best new off-the-grid products of 2017.
[03:32:09.310 --> 03:32:11.871]  And seriously, I really think everyone should have one of these.
[03:32:11.871 --> 03:32:17.674]  I'm talking about the PPX solar generator system from our friends at Solutions from Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[03:32:17.674 --> 03:32:23.377]  The PPX is so small you can put it in your pocket, but so powerful you can run some 110 appliances at your house.
[03:32:23.797 --> 03:32:26.760]  Like a small refrigerator, so you can keep food from spoiling.
[03:32:26.760 --> 03:32:32.325]  Plus, you can take it with you to jumpstart cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, heavy equipment, even airplanes.
[03:32:32.325 --> 03:32:39.351]  The system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity, allowing you to create your own private power grid, literally anywhere in the world.
[03:32:39.351 --> 03:32:43.915]  Perfect for cabins, remote locations, anytime you need to get off the grid for a while.

[03:33:23.275 --> 03:33:32.741]  John Rappaport here in the fourth hour, in for wars.
[03:33:32.741 --> 03:33:33.522]  Super.
[03:33:33.522 --> 03:33:34.162]  Blue.
[03:33:34.162 --> 03:33:34.983]  Fluoride.
[03:33:34.983 --> 03:33:35.964]  Free.
[03:33:35.964 --> 03:33:36.804]  Toothpaste.
[03:33:36.804 --> 03:33:39.606]  Love the fluoride-free part.
[03:33:39.606 --> 03:33:40.067]  Bubblegum.
[03:33:41.152 --> 03:33:44.013]  Just arrived at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:33:44.013 --> 03:33:48.854]  Another product that goes in and out of stock, so get to it, folks!
[03:33:48.854 --> 03:33:51.755]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:33:51.755 --> 03:33:55.776]  Super Blue Toothpaste.
[03:33:55.776 --> 03:34:00.977]  Xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nanosilver, and more.
[03:34:00.977 --> 03:34:06.558]  Just $9.95 at InfoWarsStore.com while supplies last.
[03:34:06.558 --> 03:34:08.499]  It's gonna be out of stock pretty soon.
[03:34:10.197 --> 03:34:16.742]  Good halogen iodine instead of bad halogen fluoride.
[03:34:16.742 --> 03:34:17.743]  Fluoride, yeah.
[03:34:17.743 --> 03:34:25.329]  Well, I could talk about that for a long time, but just go get this product at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:34:25.329 --> 03:34:30.533]  And again, understand what this means.
[03:34:30.533 --> 03:34:32.535]  You buy a product.
[03:34:32.535 --> 03:34:34.116]  It's good.
[03:34:34.116 --> 03:34:36.778]  It helps you.
[03:34:36.778 --> 03:34:38.520]  You contribute at the same time.
[03:34:39.341 --> 03:34:49.705]  To the whole mission of InfoWars and independent media at large for the truth about what's happening in the world.
[03:34:49.705 --> 03:35:05.732]  The waking up of millions and millions of more people who understand what is happening here with the politicians and with major media and what's been happening for a long time.
[03:35:05.732 --> 03:35:07.473]  My experience has always been
[03:35:09.386 --> 03:35:14.589]  With these people in the media, you take no prisoners.
[03:35:14.589 --> 03:35:16.871]  You just don't.
[03:35:16.871 --> 03:35:19.892]  You don't allow yourself to go on this offensive.
[03:35:19.892 --> 03:35:20.953]  I'm looking at a story here.
[03:35:20.953 --> 03:35:26.556]  I'm going to read a few quotes from it in a minute, but that's the idea.
[03:35:26.556 --> 03:35:28.217]  You don't try to mimic them.
[03:35:28.217 --> 03:35:37.563]  You don't try to be the same personality that they are, which is basically androids that have a very nasty underbelly to them.
[03:35:37.563 --> 03:35:38.784]  I mean, these people hate
[03:35:39.654 --> 03:35:43.657]  To be unentitled, you know?
[03:35:43.657 --> 03:35:57.728]  It's like the kid who grows up and the parents are always telling him, you're the greatest, you're special, you're terrific, you're fantastic, here's a trophy for getting out of bed in the morning and here's another trophy for brushing your teeth and you're just absolutely a genius.
[03:35:57.728 --> 03:36:01.591]  Yes, yes, and you deserve to have everything in the world and you're
[03:36:02.351 --> 03:36:05.613]  In control of everything that, you know, you survey.
[03:36:05.613 --> 03:36:07.554]  Yeah, yes, yes, yes.
[03:36:07.554 --> 03:36:12.897]  And the other guy grows up and becomes a nightly news anchor on a major media network.
[03:36:12.897 --> 03:36:16.719]  Hello, this is blah blah blah with the news.
[03:36:16.719 --> 03:36:17.519]  Yes.
[03:36:17.519 --> 03:36:21.761]  These people hate to be unseated.
[03:36:21.761 --> 03:36:26.144]  And when you've got the truth, when you've got the facts, and you attack them,
[03:36:27.168 --> 03:36:31.910]  Yeah, Amy Schumer, my parents made me think I was a genius supermodel.
[03:36:31.910 --> 03:36:37.012]  Isn't that special, Amy?
[03:36:37.012 --> 03:36:41.414]  Does anybody care about that?
[03:36:41.414 --> 03:36:45.536]  You put these people back on their heels on the defensive.
[03:36:45.536 --> 03:36:47.697]  You call them out.
[03:36:47.697 --> 03:36:51.319]  You present the truth and you are unrelenting about it.
[03:36:52.782 --> 03:36:54.943]  That's what wins victories.
[03:36:54.943 --> 03:36:56.864]  That's what wakes people up.
[03:36:56.864 --> 03:37:01.505]  And when they wake up, they desert mainstream news and they come to you.
[03:37:01.505 --> 03:37:05.547]  They come to independent media.
[03:37:05.547 --> 03:37:09.948]  So we have the case here of Cheryl Atkinson.
[03:37:09.948 --> 03:37:15.770]  I want to spend just a bit of time.
[03:37:15.770 --> 03:37:17.751]  I want to spend a little time on this.
[03:37:18.524 --> 03:37:47.733]  You might remember she was a CBS star investigative reporter who was reporting on Benghazi, Libya, Fast and Furious, the gun walking exercise that was completely insane, that was being handled under Obama, to somehow chart the actions of Mexican drug cartels and really ended up those weapons being in the hands of cartel members who were killing people.
[03:37:48.761 --> 03:38:08.505]  And then of course there was the disaster Bolivia attack, the murders in Benghazi, and so Atkinson all of a sudden said, somebody's bugging my computer.
[03:38:08.505 --> 03:38:10.966]  She filed a lawsuit against Eric Holder.
[03:38:12.372 --> 03:38:18.975]  Former Attorney General against several federal agencies and that lawsuit is now in progress.
[03:38:18.975 --> 03:38:22.637]  And I have quotes from court documents.
[03:38:22.637 --> 03:38:36.365]  Here's how bad it can get when one of the members of the club, Mainstream News Club, goes against the fake news agenda.
[03:38:36.365 --> 03:38:40.807]  I'm quoting now from court documents in this ongoing lawsuit.
[03:38:42.935 --> 03:38:46.358]  Let me get to the beginning of that here.
[03:38:46.358 --> 03:38:47.498]  At the same time that Ms.
[03:38:47.498 --> 03:39:01.669]  Atkinson was conducting investigation and issuing certain of her high-profile news reports, the Atkinsons, this means at home, began to notice, quote, began to notice anomalies in numerous electronic devices at their home in Virginia.
[03:39:01.669 --> 03:39:03.550]  End quote.
[03:39:05.532 --> 03:39:18.438]  Included Atkinson's work-issued laptop computer and a family desktop computer, quote, turning on and off at night without input from anyone in the household, end quote.
[03:39:18.438 --> 03:39:26.702]  Quote, the house alarm chirping daily at different times and television programs including problems including interference.
[03:39:28.613 --> 03:39:40.352]  All these electronic devices used the Verizon FIOS line installed in the Atkinson's home, but Verizon was unable to stanch the anomalous activity.
[03:39:42.855 --> 03:39:49.018]  In February 2012, sophisticated surveillance spyware was installed on Ms.
[03:39:49.018 --> 03:39:52.240]  Atkinson's work-issued laptop computer.
[03:39:52.240 --> 03:39:55.902]  A later forensic computer analysis revealed that Ms.
[03:39:55.902 --> 03:40:03.406]  Atkinson's laptop and family desktop computer had been the targets of unauthorized surveillance efforts.
[03:40:03.406 --> 03:40:05.927]  That same analysis revealed that Ms.
[03:40:05.927 --> 03:40:09.009]  Atkinson's mobile phone was also targeted for surveillance.
[03:40:09.529 --> 03:40:13.533]  When it was connected to the family's desktop computer.
[03:40:13.533 --> 03:40:14.954]  You getting all this, folks?
[03:40:14.954 --> 03:40:17.956]  We're talking about serious surveillance here.
[03:40:17.956 --> 03:40:19.858]  And harassment.
[03:40:19.858 --> 03:40:20.719]  Not just surveillance.
[03:40:20.719 --> 03:40:22.240]  Harassment.
[03:40:22.240 --> 03:40:27.665]  Because she was obviously aware of this, as was the whole family.
[03:40:27.665 --> 03:40:36.993]  Executed via an IP address owned, controlled, and operated by the United States Postal Service.
[03:40:39.662 --> 03:40:40.442]  Get it?
[03:40:40.442 --> 03:40:52.968]  The infiltration of that computer, Atkinson's, and the extraction of information from it was executed via an IP address owned, controlled, and operated by the United States Postal Service.
[03:40:55.009 --> 03:41:16.484]  Additionally, based on the sophisticated nature of the software used to carry out the infiltration and software fingerprints indicating the use of the federal government's proprietary software, the infiltration and surveillance appear to be perpetrated by persons in the federal government.
[03:41:16.484 --> 03:41:19.446]  And it goes on and on from there.
[03:41:19.446 --> 03:41:23.409]  That's what happens to members of the club who defect.
[03:41:25.319 --> 03:41:26.819]  As she did.
[03:41:26.819 --> 03:41:29.520]  She resigned from CBS News.
[03:41:29.520 --> 03:41:33.781]  In part because she couldn't get any justice.
[03:41:33.781 --> 03:41:37.582]  So she's suing Eric Holder.
[03:41:37.582 --> 03:41:41.343]  She's suing the head or the former head of the U.S.
[03:41:41.343 --> 03:41:43.824]  Postal Service.
[03:41:43.824 --> 03:41:47.265]  She's suing several federal agencies and a judge
[03:41:48.607 --> 03:41:50.068]  Just issued an order.
[03:41:50.068 --> 03:41:54.891]  He could have dismissed the suit, but he said, you're in the wrong venue.
[03:41:54.891 --> 03:41:59.413]  I'm going to transfer this lawsuit to the correct venue in Eastern Virginia.
[03:41:59.413 --> 03:42:02.835]  I'm not going to dismiss it because Ms.
[03:42:02.835 --> 03:42:08.938]  Atkinson deserves to have her complaints on the record and her day in court.
[03:42:08.938 --> 03:42:11.460]  This is a live lawsuit going on.
[03:42:12.373 --> 03:42:17.617]  Memo to Jeff Sessions, new Attorney General of the U.S.
[03:42:17.617 --> 03:42:28.264]  Jeff, open up an investigation now into what's really happening with a former member of the club, Cheryl Atkison.
[03:42:28.264 --> 03:42:31.526]  Launch your own investigation into the Atkison case.
[03:42:31.526 --> 03:42:33.427]  Bring it front and center.
[03:42:33.427 --> 03:42:39.271]  Uncover all the nasty details and expose the perpetrators.
[03:42:39.271 --> 03:42:40.532]  You bet.
[03:42:40.532 --> 03:42:40.992]  Why not?
[03:42:41.519 --> 03:42:43.422]  We're talking about spying these days, right?
[03:42:43.422 --> 03:42:45.725]  The Susan Rice scandal.
[03:42:45.725 --> 03:42:48.409]  Unmasking the names of Trump associates.
[03:42:49.646 --> 03:43:00.994]  That were contained in secret intelligence, US intelligence documents, and if you start to try to follow the thread of this insane story, it all comes back to the same thing.
[03:43:00.994 --> 03:43:13.023]  Somehow, if the Trump transition team, or anybody they knew, or anybody those people knew, talked to somebody who is a foreign leader, they must be colluding.
[03:43:13.023 --> 03:43:18.107]  It's got to be some kind of, you know, treason, traitorous, treachery.
[03:43:19.427 --> 03:43:21.328]  I mean, come on, right?
[03:43:21.328 --> 03:43:26.470]  So Susan Rice has now been unmasked herself, and the question is, well, how far does U.S.
[03:43:26.470 --> 03:43:30.471]  spying under Obama administration really go?
[03:43:30.471 --> 03:43:32.712]  And other administrations, indeed.
[03:43:32.712 --> 03:43:34.613]  But we're talking about Obama now.
[03:43:34.613 --> 03:43:37.174]  You know, the king, the prince, the prophet.
[03:43:37.174 --> 03:43:38.874]  Well, it goes very far, obviously.
[03:43:38.874 --> 03:43:42.475]  This is just the tip of the iceberg.
[03:43:42.475 --> 03:43:45.637]  For example, the Sheryl Atkinson case, right?
[03:43:45.637 --> 03:43:46.637]  And there's a lot more.
[03:43:47.256 --> 03:43:50.077]  And a lot more can come out here.
[03:43:50.077 --> 03:44:01.342]  A lot more about the government under Obama spying on media, reporters, editors, politicians.
[03:44:01.342 --> 03:44:07.725]  Remember the case of suddenly senators complaining that the CIA was spying on them?
[03:44:07.725 --> 03:44:11.847]  Dianne Feinstein was really all wrought up about it, exercised about it.
[03:44:11.847 --> 03:44:14.108]  Yeah, you bet.
[03:44:14.108 --> 03:44:15.008]  Forget about that one?
[03:44:18.450 --> 03:44:23.616]  This spying goes deep, deep, deep, deep.
[03:44:23.616 --> 03:44:27.160]  The Susan Rice case is just the beginning.
[03:44:27.160 --> 03:44:31.625]  Yeah, here's a headline from the Washington Post, 2014.
[03:44:31.625 --> 03:44:39.274]  Feinstein doesn't like the CIA spying on her committee, but she's fine with NSA bulk data collection.
[03:44:42.004 --> 03:44:52.471]  As long as that bulk data doesn't have anything to do with me, or isn't exposed, exposing me and all my peccadilloes, sure, she's fine with that.
[03:44:52.471 --> 03:44:54.112]  No problem.
[03:44:54.112 --> 03:44:55.352]  No problem.
[03:44:55.352 --> 03:45:01.856]  Cosmic spying is great, but nobody spy on me.
[03:45:01.856 --> 03:45:07.900]  And the major media just keep playing along with this agenda, playing along with this agenda.
[03:45:08.962 --> 03:45:18.329]  That it's all about somehow, you know, the Obama administration was just clean and pure and wonderful.
[03:45:18.329 --> 03:45:25.253]  And the Trump administration after 70 days is Joseph Stalin.
[03:45:25.253 --> 03:45:26.214]  End of story.
[03:45:26.214 --> 03:45:29.396]  Everything goes into those two wells.
[03:45:29.396 --> 03:45:30.797]  Just keeps on going.
[03:45:30.797 --> 03:45:31.518]  Here we go.
[03:45:31.518 --> 03:45:32.278]  Here we go.
[03:45:32.278 --> 03:45:32.939]  Here we go.
[03:45:32.939 --> 03:45:34.580]  Here we go.
[03:45:34.580 --> 03:45:34.740]  Yeah.
[03:45:37.040 --> 03:45:43.166]  Taking down major media news is an ongoing operation.
[03:45:43.166 --> 03:45:46.149]  It's a conspiracy of the good.
[03:45:46.149 --> 03:45:47.471]  The good people.
[03:45:47.471 --> 03:45:49.633]  The people who want the truth to come out.
[03:45:49.633 --> 03:45:51.294]  Who dig for the truth.
[03:45:51.294 --> 03:45:54.638]  Who present it to the American people and people all over the world.
[03:45:54.638 --> 03:45:56.299]  That's what's happening.
[03:45:56.299 --> 03:45:59.262]  And all of a sudden now we're hearing, what's his name?
[03:45:59.262 --> 03:45:59.663]  Junker?
[03:46:00.851 --> 03:46:05.012]  Yes, Mr. Junker, John Claude, the head of the EU.
[03:46:05.012 --> 03:46:08.493]  Oh, he's going to punish America.
[03:46:08.493 --> 03:46:10.554]  Yes, indeed.
[03:46:10.554 --> 03:46:15.795]  If America continues to support Brexit and is against the European Union.
[03:46:15.795 --> 03:46:21.977]  Yeah, that's fascist superstructure that rules over, you know, much of Europe.
[03:46:21.977 --> 03:46:23.457]  Unelected, unaccountable.
[03:46:24.204 --> 03:46:25.524]  Yes, he's going to come here.
[03:46:25.524 --> 03:46:28.885]  And he's going to, let's see, what will he do?
[03:46:28.885 --> 03:46:33.606]  He's going to encourage Texas and Ohio to secede from the Union.
[03:46:33.606 --> 03:46:35.206]  Yes, indeed.
[03:46:35.206 --> 03:46:37.466]  Really, John Claude, is that what you're really going to do?
[03:46:37.466 --> 03:46:39.807]  You think you have a prayer?
[03:46:39.807 --> 03:46:45.548]  And as I wrote a few days ago, come!
[03:46:45.548 --> 03:46:46.588]  Show up!
[03:46:46.588 --> 03:46:48.708]  We need you!
[03:46:48.708 --> 03:46:51.929]  There are too many people in this country versus
[03:46:53.103 --> 03:46:59.905]  The government, in other words, to have a limited republic, you've got to have people closer to the government who have choice.
[03:46:59.905 --> 03:47:01.345]  Indeed.
[03:47:01.345 --> 03:47:03.926]  We should have a few states to cede.
[03:47:03.926 --> 03:47:05.346]  At least a few states.
[03:47:05.346 --> 03:47:07.987]  No question about it.
[03:47:07.987 --> 03:47:10.167]  Come help us, Jean-Claude.
[03:47:10.167 --> 03:47:12.088]  We need your wisdom.
[03:47:12.088 --> 03:47:13.048]  Yes, indeed.
[03:47:13.048 --> 03:47:14.428]  We really do.
[03:47:14.428 --> 03:47:16.589]  Indeed we do.
[03:47:16.589 --> 03:47:17.209]  Absolutely.
[03:47:21.388 --> 03:47:24.629]  So the major media plays this up as if it's a real threat.
[03:47:24.629 --> 03:47:26.650]  Oh yes, my God.
[03:47:26.650 --> 03:47:29.691]  The head of the European Union is threatening America.
[03:47:29.691 --> 03:47:31.452]  We should all tremble indeed.
[03:47:31.452 --> 03:47:36.493]  Yes, we should all tremble.
[03:47:36.493 --> 03:47:42.555]  Trump has to get out ahead of all of this.
[03:47:42.555 --> 03:47:49.698]  If he still stands for what he stood for, if he is the person
[03:47:50.467 --> 03:47:56.429]  Who is going to defeat globalism and make America free and prosperous?
[03:47:56.429 --> 03:48:01.051]  And I'm sure some people are saying, well that's ridiculous, he never intended to do that, blah blah blah.
[03:48:01.051 --> 03:48:02.512]  Okay, whatever.
[03:48:02.512 --> 03:48:07.234]  But if he is that person, there's only one way to handle this situation.
[03:48:07.234 --> 03:48:11.916]  You become your own news outlet, as many of us have.
[03:48:11.916 --> 03:48:13.837]  We've been through it, Donnie.
[03:48:13.837 --> 03:48:17.118]  We know what it's like to build it up from nothing.
[03:48:18.331 --> 03:48:30.101]  To become your own media outlet because you want freedom as opposed to brainwashing and mind control from major media news.
[03:48:30.101 --> 03:48:32.963]  That's what you want, right?
[03:48:32.963 --> 03:48:41.870]  So, the solution, as we have learned out here, Donnie, is you build your own media network now.
[03:48:41.870 --> 03:48:46.014]  Livestream online, bypass all the major media,
[03:48:46.753 --> 03:49:01.260]  Lunatics, criminals, CIA assets, etc, etc, dispensing lies, falsehoods, obfuscations, distractions to the American people 24 hours a day.
[03:49:01.260 --> 03:49:06.063]  You go past all that.
[03:49:06.063 --> 03:49:09.164]  And you speak every day to the American people.
[03:49:09.164 --> 03:49:15.007]  And you remind yourself, first of all, of why you're there and why millions of people supported you.
[03:49:16.548 --> 03:49:22.413]  Why millions of people said, well, I'm going to hitch my wagon to this horse.
[03:49:22.413 --> 03:49:34.183]  I don't know who he is exactly, but what he's saying is quite different from anything I've ever heard in a long time from anybody running for president who managed to get this far.
[03:49:34.183 --> 03:49:35.184]  Let's take a chance.
[03:49:35.184 --> 03:49:36.124]  Let's take a ride.
[03:49:36.124 --> 03:49:37.646]  Let's see what happens.
[03:49:37.646 --> 03:49:40.548]  Let's go for it.
[03:49:40.548 --> 03:49:45.352]  The people who did that are the ones who are actually in power, not Trump.
[03:49:46.858 --> 03:49:50.701]  So you want to talk to those people every day.
[03:49:50.701 --> 03:50:14.638]  You want to talk to those people every day, Mr. Trump, and remind yourself, first of all, of why you're there, on what basis, what you're going to do to make it happen, and how you're going to cut away all of the cobwebs and all of the spiders and all of the red tape in order to communicate directly and get it done directly.
[03:50:15.985 --> 03:50:32.551]  With a mandate from the people who want it done and want it done directly and simply and clearly without any bleeping back and forth and all kinds of insanity.
[03:50:32.551 --> 03:50:35.132]  Okay?
[03:50:35.132 --> 03:50:38.634]  That's what the people want and there's only one way to deliver that.
[03:50:38.634 --> 03:50:42.275]  You've got to talk to the people every day.
[03:50:42.275 --> 03:50:44.636]  No self-inflating nonsense.
[03:50:46.034 --> 03:50:50.601]  Straight from the shoulder about the agenda that got you elected.
[03:50:50.601 --> 03:50:53.765]  That's what you've got to do.
[03:50:53.765 --> 03:50:57.951]  We will be back after the break for the last segment here on InfoWars.
[03:51:00.774 --> 03:51:08.857]  What if ExtendoVite really works, but you find that hard to believe, and you spend precious time looking for someone to say, just try it.
[03:51:08.857 --> 03:51:16.719]  I have my help today because of ExtendoVite, and if I did not take a leap of faith and try it, well, I would be on disability today.
[03:51:16.719 --> 03:51:21.520]  Take one bottle of ExtendoVite as suggested for 60 days to find out for yourself.
[03:51:21.520 --> 03:51:23.941]  No need to stop any other meds you may be on.
[03:51:23.941 --> 03:51:26.182]  You know by now that they are not working for you.
[03:51:26.542 --> 03:51:33.305]  Before the 60 days are up, I know that you will feel Xtendivite working for you and will want to take another bottle.
[03:51:33.305 --> 03:51:34.446]  Life is too short!
[03:51:34.446 --> 03:51:36.407]  Get your Xtendivite today!
[03:51:36.407 --> 03:51:41.869]  Xtendivite is available in capsule or liquid form for just $69.95 for a 2-month supply.

[03:52:29.994 --> 03:52:35.116]  The answer to being in control of your own health care is freedom from insurance.
[03:52:35.116 --> 03:52:40.817]  Become part of a group of self-pay patients that come together to share in each other's medical expenses.

[03:53:00.154 --> 03:53:11.022]  What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality, feeling better than you have in years, and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns, blood sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?
[03:53:11.022 --> 03:53:15.165]  There's something that is changing thousands of people's lives, and you could be one of them.
[03:53:15.165 --> 03:53:17.326]  It's called Heart and Body Extract.
[03:53:17.326 --> 03:53:22.770]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract, talks about the positive effects of Heart and Body Extract.
[03:53:22.930 --> 03:53:32.916]  What happens with the Formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.
[03:53:32.916 --> 03:53:39.380]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries.
[03:53:39.380 --> 03:53:42.722]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetics.
[03:53:42.722 --> 03:53:44.783]  So the body is an amazing thing.
[03:53:44.783 --> 03:53:47.705]  It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.
[03:53:47.905 --> 03:53:49.586]  Last segment here in the fourth hour.
[03:54:18.021 --> 03:54:25.464]  My experience with major media news was always, they will take whatever they can get.
[03:54:25.464 --> 03:54:30.285]  They'll gobble up more territory of the mind.
[03:54:30.285 --> 03:54:32.306]  Of the mind.
[03:54:32.306 --> 03:54:39.849]  Anytime they can rope it in, anytime they can corral it, that's what they're going to do.
[03:54:39.849 --> 03:54:41.809]  That's what they're there for.
[03:54:41.809 --> 03:54:43.270]  That's their whole operation.
[03:54:44.486 --> 03:54:46.168]  They do it by lies.
[03:54:46.168 --> 03:54:48.930]  They do it by omission of vital data.
[03:54:48.930 --> 03:54:52.194]  They do it by providing no context.
[03:54:52.194 --> 03:55:04.365]  They do it by getting so-called experts on to tell the lies they want told and to marginalize other experts who would be able to tell a completely different story.
[03:55:04.365 --> 03:55:07.729]  And their whole act is to be able to say
[03:55:09.289 --> 03:55:10.770]  We cover the waterfront.
[03:55:10.770 --> 03:55:14.232]  There is no other news except our news.
[03:55:14.232 --> 03:55:20.155]  And now they see that the war has changed that situation.
[03:55:20.155 --> 03:55:25.598]  And in fact, they have no strategy to combat that.
[03:55:25.598 --> 03:55:27.959]  They have nothing.
[03:55:27.959 --> 03:55:31.901]  They're firing people because they can't afford to pay them.
[03:55:31.901 --> 03:55:37.504]  They're refinancing the financing of the financing of their debt, like the New York Times.
[03:55:39.437 --> 03:55:49.860]  The whole thing is beginning to come down and to crumble because people have reached the end of their rope.
[03:55:49.860 --> 03:56:00.663]  And it's not just people on the right or people on the left or people in the middle or whatever, whatever division you want to concoct.
[03:56:00.663 --> 03:56:06.825]  Everybody, you know, everybody has a serious bone to pick with these people.
[03:56:07.907 --> 03:56:11.690]  Because the recognition is there.
[03:56:11.690 --> 03:56:21.257]  It's like when you sit down in a restaurant, let's say, with a couple of friends, and one of the friends brings over somebody and says, I'd like you to meet Bob.
[03:56:21.257 --> 03:56:22.618]  And Bob sits down.
[03:56:22.618 --> 03:56:28.442]  And as soon as Bob opens his yap, you know he's lying.
[03:56:28.442 --> 03:56:29.763]  He's a phony.
[03:56:29.763 --> 03:56:31.325]  He's self-inflating.
[03:56:31.325 --> 03:56:35.248]  He thinks he has a certain entitlement that comes from somewhere.
[03:56:36.363 --> 03:56:39.584]  He's all of that in three seconds.
[03:56:39.584 --> 03:56:45.066]  And he believes that he controls the entire territory.
[03:56:45.066 --> 03:56:49.748]  And whatever he says is the word from above.
[03:56:49.748 --> 03:56:51.189]  You get that immediately.
[03:56:51.189 --> 03:56:53.510]  Now, what are you going to do?
[03:56:53.510 --> 03:56:56.971]  Well, if it's just five minutes in a restaurant, who cares?
[03:56:56.971 --> 03:56:57.911]  But suppose it's 24-7.
[03:56:57.911 --> 03:57:00.352]  On every screen in the world.
[03:57:05.313 --> 03:57:06.734]  Suppose it's that.
[03:57:06.734 --> 03:57:10.316]  Suppose that's really what it is.
[03:57:10.316 --> 03:57:12.738]  Now you've got to do something.
[03:57:12.738 --> 03:57:15.519]  Now you've got to do something.
[03:57:15.519 --> 03:57:18.821]  Now you've got to take that down.
[03:57:18.821 --> 03:57:28.747]  And the best way to take it down is to expose it and to present the deeper truth that Bob is dedicated to obscuring.
[03:57:28.747 --> 03:57:30.708]  That's the game, folks.
[03:57:30.708 --> 03:57:32.589]  The game is afoot.
[03:57:32.589 --> 03:57:33.330]  We are winning.
[03:57:34.139 --> 03:57:36.621]  We need more of your support.
[03:57:36.621 --> 03:57:41.565]  We need more people becoming independent media.
[03:57:41.565 --> 03:57:43.427]  That's how you get there.
[03:57:43.427 --> 03:57:57.939]  You wake up one day and you say, I am my own media and I am going to begin broadcasting and transmitting and writing the truth as I find it.
[03:57:57.939 --> 03:58:00.001]  That's where it all begins.
[03:58:00.001 --> 03:58:01.322]  That's called waking up.
[03:58:02.958 --> 03:58:05.739]  Waking up upon waking up.
[03:58:05.739 --> 03:58:07.840]  That's what that is.
[03:58:07.840 --> 03:58:16.364]  Instead of just percolating in your head what you know, put it out, put it out, and put it out, and put it out.
[03:58:17.725 --> 03:58:20.246]  Become your own media.
[03:58:20.246 --> 03:58:22.547]  That's what the game is.
[03:58:22.547 --> 03:58:36.695]  And Bob will very soon find himself out on his butt in the street with nothing because no one wants to hear Bob anymore or listen to what he has to say.
[03:58:36.695 --> 03:58:38.195]  Thank you very much.
[03:58:38.195 --> 03:58:39.596]  John Rappaport on InfoWars.
[03:58:39.596 --> 03:58:43.438]  We'll see you next time.
[03:58:43.438 --> 03:58:47.400]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
