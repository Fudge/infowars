[00:00.000 --> 00:07.800]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop
[00:07.800 --> 00:28.760]  tyranny will so does he live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex joe
[00:37.800 --> 00:54.040]  that's the great motor city madman tenuja great texas transplant we're
[00:54.040 --> 01:01.040]  gonna see him it is monday march 4th 2019 I'm your host alex jones in studio
[01:01.040 --> 01:06.800]  you will have paul joseph Watson joining us just flew in last night he'll be
[01:06.800 --> 01:11.000]  hosting with us for two hours coming up today will be in studio the next few
[01:11.000 --> 01:14.560]  days as well working on a lot of big things with paul here will be announced
[01:14.560 --> 01:19.760]  soon you know the big takeaway obviously isn't just that the democrats are
[01:19.760 --> 01:23.880]  launching dozens and dozens and dozens of fake new investigations as the Mueller
[01:23.880 --> 01:29.720]  report release is imminent the bigger takeaway is that mainstream corporate
[01:29.720 --> 01:34.360]  media has been breeding communism and socialism in the corporate world and in
[01:34.360 --> 01:38.800]  the universities for decades and now like aliens popping out of somebody's
[01:38.800 --> 01:44.360]  stomach in the movie alien they're busting forth new yorker magazine when
[01:44.360 --> 01:49.440]  did everyone become a socialist the new york post goes out those interviews
[01:49.440 --> 01:56.440]  socialism's millennial fans don't know what it is we've sent our reporters out
[01:56.440 --> 02:00.080]  but so if comes to the groups and they ask him what it is they don't know who
[02:00.080 --> 02:03.680]  the president is they don't know the branches of government they don't know
[02:03.680 --> 02:07.800]  why venezuela's collapsing they don't understand anything they just heard I'm
[02:07.800 --> 02:15.760]  gonna get something free these are the same schmucks that go and they sign up
[02:15.760 --> 02:22.160]  for these university educations that are about worthless around 90% of the time
[02:22.160 --> 02:26.440]  I'm not knocking college it used to be good but when you made government get
[02:26.440 --> 02:29.840]  involved in it and put all these trillions into it it drove up prices and
[02:29.840 --> 02:34.340]  lowered quality because it took competition out of it and now it's
[02:34.340 --> 02:40.680]  wrecked so when we come back next segment I'm going to plow into the story
[02:40.680 --> 02:46.960]  first that I've got right here in my stack right here in my stack when did
[02:46.960 --> 02:54.440]  everyone become a socialist well when did everyone become so stupid now we're
[02:54.440 --> 02:59.720]  also going to get into the latest on AOC because she is the gift that just keeps
[02:59.720 --> 03:07.760]  on giving to illustrate the mindset of the average leftist brainwashed zombie
[03:07.760 --> 03:11.440]  people say how are you gonna pay for everything being free we'll just do it
[03:11.440 --> 03:15.280]  well why do you drive gas guzzling cars and fly on more airplanes than almost
[03:15.280 --> 03:20.920]  anybody but you say carbon so bad she says I'm just in the world I live in you
[03:20.920 --> 03:24.320]  go out and eat hamburgers AOC you say we shouldn't you go out and fly on
[03:24.320 --> 03:31.160]  private jets but say we shouldn't fly commercial in coach this is who you are
[03:31.160 --> 03:40.640]  it's how you operate and everything you say you stand for is the opposite
[03:40.640 --> 03:49.680]  everything you say that you believe in is actually the opposite of what you do so
[03:49.680 --> 03:54.800]  we're going to be looking at all of this today and then really some incredible
[03:54.800 --> 03:58.560]  developments on the censorship front where the Southern Primary Law Center the
[03:58.560 --> 04:04.760]  ADL media matters and hope not hate that that's the same group out of the UK are
[04:04.760 --> 04:08.520]  admitting okay we just want all nationalists and conservatives and
[04:08.520 --> 04:13.800]  Christians and pro gun rights groups taken off the internet and they're now
[04:13.800 --> 04:18.840]  listening Paul Joseph Watson Tommy Robinson and countless others just
[04:18.840 --> 04:24.680]  saying period they're too popular take them off and they have the minister in
[04:24.680 --> 04:32.880]  England who is over the internet threatening to find Google if they
[04:32.880 --> 04:38.280]  don't take Tommy Robinson and others off the internet and why is that because
[04:38.280 --> 04:42.720]  Tommy Robinson that undercover floats the BBC trying to get women to say that
[04:42.720 --> 04:49.240]  he'd assault them that's right because he's exposing their criminal activity
[04:49.240 --> 04:52.240]  we got these trucks on the run and they're going to fail and their
[04:52.240 --> 04:56.960]  censorship is going to fail but they've gotten very very very bold very very out
[04:56.960 --> 05:02.960]  of control well I've got some really good news for all the viewers and all the
[05:02.960 --> 05:05.760]  listeners this was going to be a big loss because we couldn't get the deep

[06:18.280 --> 06:24.840]  you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance live from the info
[06:24.840 --> 06:30.120]  wars.com studios it's alex jones
[06:38.840 --> 06:46.840]  well the New Yorker magazine on its cover asked the question when did
[06:46.840 --> 06:53.200]  everyone become a socialist you mean when did everyone going to the
[06:53.200 --> 06:57.400]  universities getting the worst worthless degrees and 90 plus percent of the
[06:57.400 --> 07:05.080]  cases openly tell us who they were in fact in major polls more than 50% of
[07:05.080 --> 07:09.520]  Millennials are either communists are socialists but they don't want to live
[07:09.520 --> 07:14.360]  in a communist or socialist country they want to live in the wreckage of a once
[07:14.360 --> 07:19.600]  great capitalist nation falling into socialism and they want free stuff on
[07:19.600 --> 07:27.640]  the ride down to Venezuelan or North Korean oblivion and they want to be
[07:27.640 --> 07:33.480]  functionaries within the system during that phase of the cannibalization of
[07:33.480 --> 07:40.280]  civilization to exercise power but they are extremely lazy they are extremely
[07:40.280 --> 07:47.360]  stupid they are beyond redemption in many cases and so they will never rule
[07:47.360 --> 07:52.400]  anything this is mega corporations sabotaging nations with the virus of
[07:52.400 --> 07:57.480]  collectivism the virus of communism and socialism to collapse them so they can
[07:57.480 --> 08:03.080]  then be vertically integrated after the collapse and then set up into a neo
[08:03.080 --> 08:08.120]  feudalistic fascist system like so-called communist China that is really a
[08:08.120 --> 08:15.680]  hyper-fascist oligarchy with less than a ruling one less than 1,000 ruling
[08:15.680 --> 08:23.320]  individuals over the enslaved population and parlaying their labor their energy
[08:23.320 --> 08:29.480]  out to the rest of the world socialism's millennial fans don't even know what it
[08:29.480 --> 08:36.920]  is the New York Post went out and talked to the average Democrat voter talked to
[08:36.920 --> 08:41.200]  college students looked at a bunch of different Gallup polls talked to fans
[08:41.200 --> 08:48.040]  of Alexandria Cortez or AOC and the whole situations they're pushing and
[08:48.040 --> 08:53.240]  found that they don't even know what socialism is well the controllers know
[08:53.240 --> 08:58.360]  what it is but the minions don't so when they hear Cortez say all your health
[08:58.360 --> 09:02.400]  care will be free your college will be free your transportation will be free
[09:02.400 --> 09:08.240]  your lodging will be free your food will be free except who's going to produce
[09:08.240 --> 09:13.680]  that who's going to put the labor and the energy in well the globalist think
[09:13.680 --> 09:18.840]  in the future it'll be robots but see they're putting robots in place so that
[09:18.840 --> 09:23.440]  humans can't have a future and so humans are obsolete and that's the big
[09:23.440 --> 09:29.920]  globalist trap make us dependent set up a post-human world create a system with
[09:29.920 --> 09:35.200]  a vast majority of people are lazy spoiled brats and then get the tiny elite
[09:35.200 --> 09:39.640]  who are still cognizant still hard-working and still focused and by
[09:39.640 --> 09:43.960]  elite I mean elite in that they've kept their humanity having them sign on with
[09:43.960 --> 09:50.040]  the technocrats for the orderly extermination of 99% of the population
[09:50.040 --> 09:57.360]  that is the big giant enchilada and here's the article pink goes have more
[09:57.360 --> 10:06.400]  fun a disgusting New York magazine article about how cool pinkos are and
[10:06.400 --> 10:13.320]  how stylish and how awesome they are a bunch of mentally ill clowns wearing
[10:13.320 --> 10:17.400]  thousand and two thousand three thousand dollar wardrobes made by slaves in
[10:17.400 --> 10:23.640]  China meanwhile we're easy victims inside the country so dangerous to police
[10:23.640 --> 10:31.600]  they're fleeing the nation El Salvador tens of thousands dead ms-13 ruling the
[10:31.600 --> 10:36.560]  nation but the left here in America says there's God's children and wants them
[10:36.560 --> 10:44.720]  here the more the merrier because again it's people committed to the takedown of
[10:44.720 --> 10:49.800]  civilization to capture it then later the globalists come in and mop up after
[10:49.800 --> 10:54.000]  the socialists the communists have taken the nation down let's continue with
[10:54.000 --> 11:01.640]  the hypocrisy gas guzzling car rides expose AOC's hypocrisy amid green new
[11:01.640 --> 11:05.120]  deal pledge a study done because it's in the federal elections commission
[11:05.120 --> 11:09.680]  numbers of the thousands and thousands of uber rides she took show that their
[11:09.680 --> 11:16.800]  favorite is big black Tahoe's and of course the other large SUVs like
[11:16.800 --> 11:22.680]  suburban's and that she flies around all these celebrity galas on jets but what
[11:22.680 --> 11:30.000]  does AOC have to say about that well she responds to carbon footprint expo say
[11:30.000 --> 11:38.160]  saying I'm just living in the world that's right when she her boyfriend her
[11:38.160 --> 11:43.880]  chief of staff sit down to have hamburger meals that's okay you don't
[11:43.880 --> 11:49.720]  get hamburgers she it's hamburgers and she could eat a few with what appears to
[11:49.720 --> 11:55.320]  be all that meth she's using withering away of course the photos this is like
[11:55.320 --> 11:59.120]  her food's gone on eating the chief of staff doesn't look like he's on methamphetamine
[11:59.120 --> 12:06.760]  like meth mouth woman AOC but continuing ladies and gentlemen freshman
[12:06.760 --> 12:11.120]  New York representative Alexandria Cortez responded to the post report on her
[12:11.120 --> 12:16.200]  giant carbon footprint by saying that she's just living in the world also fly
[12:16.200 --> 12:21.720]  and use AC the Green New Deal touting politician tweeted Saturday night living
[12:21.720 --> 12:26.080]  in a world as it is isn't an argument against working towards a better future
[12:26.080 --> 12:32.440]  according to the GND fact sheet the nation's most totally overhauled
[12:32.440 --> 12:37.080]  transportation by massively spanning electric vehicles manufacturing building
[12:37.080 --> 12:41.480]  and charging situations everywhere built on high-speed rail create affordable
[12:41.480 --> 12:46.760]  public transit available to all with the goal to replace every combustion engine
[12:46.760 --> 12:54.080]  vehicle but of course that would only mean combustion vehicles in Europe and
[12:54.080 --> 12:59.520]  the United States and Australia China and India and Mexico and 160 other
[12:59.520 --> 13:04.880]  nations they make zero cuts it's all written to shut us down at an industrial
[13:04.880 --> 13:09.400]  level and that's what the founder of Greenpeace has come out and said he said
[13:09.400 --> 13:13.160]  he found a Greenpeace to actually try to save species and help the environment
[13:13.160 --> 13:17.560]  but it's been hijacked by globalists who create global taxes and control and
[13:17.560 --> 13:22.720]  surveil everyone zero hedge comm as the article it's up on info wars dot com and
[13:22.720 --> 13:30.080]  news wars dot com Greenpeace co-founder rips pompous little twit AOC as garden
[13:30.080 --> 13:39.800]  variety hypocrite on climate and that is definitely the truth now we're going to
[13:39.800 --> 13:44.480]  continue after we go to break with the really big news that ties into the
[13:44.480 --> 13:51.320]  governor of Virginia and why they think you only remember him in blackface that
[13:51.320 --> 13:55.520]  was brought out days after he was caught openly promoting killing babies
[13:55.520 --> 14:00.360]  after they're born we've got big new developments on that front San Diego
[14:00.360 --> 14:07.800]  pathologist accused of improperly harvesting children's organs and their
[14:07.800 --> 14:15.680]  tissue in Texas lawsuit that's out of the San Diego Tribune San Diego Union
[14:15.680 --> 14:21.920]  Tribune we'll be getting to the rest of the story like Paul Harvey would always
[14:21.920 --> 14:27.840]  say when we come back then we're going to look at DNC says attempted cyber
[14:27.840 --> 14:32.800]  attack wasn't Russia it was a test from Michigan by the Democrats a false
[14:32.800 --> 14:36.800]  flaggy and the reason that's important is you're going to be seeing more of
[14:36.800 --> 14:39.960]  these and they hope you're stupid and aren't aware of what's happening then
[14:39.960 --> 14:47.760]  of course US House panel launches probe into possible obstruction by Trump it
[14:47.760 --> 14:55.520]  only intensifies from that point on so we're going to go to break come back
[14:55.520 --> 15:00.000]  and break it all down two key points I want to hit right now though before we
[15:00.000 --> 15:10.320]  go any further PQQ with CoQ 10 when it is from organically derived sources is
[15:10.320 --> 15:19.560]  incredible almost all of the CoQ 10 and PPQ and and other systems are synthetic
[15:19.560 --> 15:26.160]  and really don't do anything but there are patented forms of bio PQQ and CoQ
[15:26.160 --> 15:29.800]  10 that give you the maximum effect and a lot of them are sold at medical
[15:29.800 --> 15:33.920]  offices for $400 $500 without a prescription but you get them from
[15:33.920 --> 15:38.800]  medical offices and they still mark up six seven times we only mark it up 150
[15:38.800 --> 15:42.920]  percent that's how we can normally sell it for a hundred and fifty dollars DNA
[15:42.920 --> 15:45.920]  force so it's our flagship most expensive product but incredibly
[15:45.920 --> 15:49.960]  discounted it's been sold out again for six months because it's so hard to
[15:49.960 --> 15:55.720]  procure and develop and get it is back 33% off DNA force is finally back in

[19:07.800 --> 19:12.640]  future so you support us and get creative and get fired up we won't just be
[19:12.640 --> 19:15.240]  here a hundred years we'll be here forever we'll turn the whole thing around
[19:15.240 --> 19:19.880]  our grandchildren on Mars bases and jump bases and God knows what are gonna look
[19:19.880 --> 19:23.760]  back and say you know that we struggled here we made it and that's really where
[19:23.760 --> 19:28.080]  this goes but God's got a big war for you ready and so if you can't face George
[19:28.080 --> 19:31.880]  Soros and Hillary Clinton and Adolf Hitler and Mao Zedong are you gonna
[19:31.880 --> 19:35.800]  really be able to face the other stuff because God wants warriors that are
[19:35.800 --> 19:39.840]  smart and ready to build things and are also ready to fight you don't go to the
[19:39.840 --> 19:42.840]  next level without getting a big weight put on your back and I mean I don't know
[19:42.840 --> 19:46.680]  what's gonna happen to me in the future I mean all I know is I want to go with
[19:46.680 --> 19:50.920]  the master built I want to go to the next level I want to be with the spirit
[19:50.920 --> 19:54.840]  that I've experienced not these devil worshipers they're cold and failed and
[19:54.840 --> 19:59.840]  feels like being a tomb I want life I want Jesus you're listening to the Alex
[19:59.840 --> 20:10.840]  Jones show
[20:10.840 --> 20:38.840]  my Frankenstein
[20:38.840 --> 20:57.840]  here's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna get into the bottom of the rat hole the
[20:57.840 --> 21:02.840]  bottom of the spider hole and why they want post birth abortion and I know the
[21:02.840 --> 21:07.280]  audience knows this but the general public does not know this and when you
[21:07.280 --> 21:11.920]  finally force people to look at it it completely freaks them out and wakes
[21:11.920 --> 21:16.920]  them up fundamentally and they say I've got to do something about this I've
[21:16.920 --> 21:20.920]  got to speak out against it and they start doing it like Joe Rogan I know
[21:20.920 --> 21:24.880]  it sounds crazy to say they've had human animal clones for decades now it's
[21:24.880 --> 21:28.520]  mainstream news you got to force folks to look at it I know it's crazy to say
[21:28.520 --> 21:31.360]  that major governments are about to push everybody getting implantable
[21:31.360 --> 21:37.120]  microchips but it's the reality of what's going on I know it's insane to say
[21:37.120 --> 21:40.920]  they're keeping babies alive and selling their organs but it's going on and
[21:40.920 --> 21:43.680]  that's why Northam is trying to normalize it because he knows it's
[21:43.680 --> 21:47.800]  coming out I'm gonna cover that next segment but this segment because I was
[21:47.800 --> 21:51.960]  out last Friday getting my ruptured bicep operated on I shot a special
[21:51.960 --> 21:57.920]  report for that evening where I talked about Paul Harvey and the weird
[21:57.920 --> 22:02.240]  coincidence that the day we made that video just thinking about him was the
[22:02.240 --> 22:07.640]  day that he died ten years before or his hundredth birthday so here is that
[22:07.640 --> 22:13.080]  powerful report that I'm gonna have reposted to info wars.com right now so
[22:13.080 --> 22:32.560]  you can share it with everyone you know Paul Harvey if I was the devil
[22:32.560 --> 22:40.960]  info wars tomorrow's news today Paul Harvey one of America's greatest
[22:40.960 --> 22:48.400]  journalists but also poets and just spoken word folk heroes is a hundred
[22:48.400 --> 22:57.280]  years old today and we're celebrating his birthday Paul Harvey died ten years
[22:57.280 --> 23:06.960]  ago today at 90 but today his spirit is a hundred years old now this is
[23:06.960 --> 23:14.520]  serendipity or a synchronicity or or Providence about a week ago one of our
[23:14.520 --> 23:19.440]  great researchers and video editors Jeremy McBrain and I were talking about
[23:19.440 --> 23:26.520]  how this is a real fight between good and evil and I said to Darren I said we
[23:26.520 --> 23:33.680]  need to illustrate that he said I have an idea let's take Paul Harvey's famous
[23:33.680 --> 23:41.240]  1960s if I was the devil speech and let's put it to what's currently happening
[23:41.240 --> 23:49.640]  and so literally 20 minutes ago before we went on air I said you know when did
[23:49.640 --> 23:54.080]  he die he died like five years ago I want to talk about Paul Harvey this video
[23:54.080 --> 23:58.720]  that Darren McBrain put together is so powerful well the most powerful things
[23:58.720 --> 24:03.880]  we've ever put out literally I think that like five years ago and and Darren pulls
[24:03.880 --> 24:13.760]  it up he goes oh my god he died ten years ago today the Satanist and the
[24:13.760 --> 24:17.680]  devil may control Hollywood they may control the Federal Reserve but they
[24:17.680 --> 24:23.800]  don't control the real universe and how God works and Paul Harvey was a good man
[24:23.800 --> 24:29.600]  and so is his family and the work they've done and so Paul Harvey's still alive
[24:29.600 --> 24:36.320]  he's with Christ today his spirit's gone on to the next level but it's just
[24:36.320 --> 24:42.600]  another sign of the synchronicity the serendipity the discernment the
[24:42.600 --> 24:49.400]  Providence the manifest destiny of liberty and freedom and so I'm going to
[24:49.400 --> 24:54.760]  air this piece and I'm gonna post it in forwards.com you can repost it
[24:54.760 --> 24:58.760]  anywhere promote it however whatever you do get it out to folks because this is a
[24:58.760 --> 25:06.040]  fight between good and evil Paul Harvey's not dead his soul and spirit lives
[25:06.040 --> 25:13.160]  on and his ideas in this realm live on there are more prophetic and poignant
[25:13.160 --> 25:20.560]  now than they were back in nineteen sixties when he first said these words
[25:21.080 --> 25:25.520]  we salute the work of Paul Harvey and all their patriots that love justice
[25:25.520 --> 25:34.160]  we're so glad his voice is alive with us today so here it is Paul Harvey if I
[25:34.160 --> 25:42.000]  was the devil and all Americans I'm Paul Harvey if I were the devil if I were
[25:42.000 --> 25:45.760]  the prince of darkness I'd want to engulf the whole world in darkness and
[25:45.760 --> 25:49.280]  I'd have a third of its real estate and four-fifths of its population but I
[25:49.280 --> 25:55.760]  wouldn't be happy until I have seized the ripest apple on the tree so I set
[25:55.760 --> 26:02.760]  about however necessary to take over the United States I'd separate the
[26:02.760 --> 26:06.560]  churches first I'd begin with a campaign of whispers with the wisdom of the
[26:06.560 --> 26:10.840]  serpent I would whisper to you as I whispered to you do as you please to the
[26:10.840 --> 26:14.400]  young I would whisper that the Bible is a myth I would convince them that man
[26:14.400 --> 26:18.320]  created God instead of the other way around I would confide that what's bad
[26:18.320 --> 26:23.400]  is good and what's good is square and the old I would teach you to pray after me
[26:23.400 --> 26:29.240]  our father which art in Washington and then I'd get organized I'd educate
[26:29.240 --> 26:32.920]  authors in how to make the Lord at literature exciting so that anything
[26:32.920 --> 26:37.120]  else would appear dull and uninteresting I'd threaten TV with dirtier movies and
[26:37.120 --> 26:41.560]  vice versa I pedal narcotics to whom I could I'd sell alcohol to ladies and
[26:41.560 --> 26:47.200]  gentlemen of distinction I tranquilize the rest with pills if I were the
[26:47.200 --> 26:51.000]  devil I'd soon have families at war with themselves churches at war with
[26:51.000 --> 26:56.160]  themselves and nations at war with themselves until each in its turn was
[26:56.160 --> 27:01.520]  consumed and with promises of higher ratings I'd have mesmerizing media
[27:01.520 --> 27:07.360]  fanning the play the president of the United States is racist if I were the devil I would
[27:07.360 --> 27:10.920]  encourage schools to refine young intellects but neglect the discipline
[27:10.920 --> 27:15.960]  emotions just let those run wild within a decade I'd have prisons overflowing I'd
[27:15.960 --> 27:20.720]  have judges promoting pornography soon I could evict God from the courthouse then
[27:20.720 --> 27:25.080]  from the schoolhouse and then from the houses of Congress and in his own churches
[27:25.080 --> 27:30.840]  I would substitute psychology for religion I would lure priests and pastors
[27:30.840 --> 27:35.800]  into misusing boys and girls and church money if I were the devil I'd take from
[27:35.800 --> 27:40.760]  those who have and give to those who want it until I had killed the incentive
[27:40.760 --> 27:46.280]  of the ambitious I would caution against extremes I'm here to warn people you
[27:46.280 --> 27:51.720]  keep telling me to shut up this isn't a game in hard work in patriotism in moral
[27:51.720 --> 27:56.200]  conduct I would convince the young that marriage is old-fashioned that swinging
[27:56.200 --> 28:01.600]  is more fun that what you see on TV is the way to be and thus I could undress you
[28:01.600 --> 28:07.560]  in public and I could lure you into bed with diseases for which there is no
[28:07.560 --> 28:11.680]  cure in other words if I were the devil I'd just keep right on doing what he's
[28:11.680 --> 28:13.840]  doing
[28:20.040 --> 28:25.160]  this is the spirit of the Antichrist what you have heard is coming and even now

[31:58.280 --> 32:05.160]  I've been doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube censorship and I've
[32:05.160 --> 32:10.320]  noticed that there's one type of video that is the most censored the most
[32:10.320 --> 32:17.640]  buried the most suppressed and that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election
[32:17.640 --> 32:21.960]  night all the arrogant leftist authoritarians like the young turds and
[32:21.960 --> 32:27.320]  others get so butt hurt when Trump won they don't want us to have that victory
[32:27.320 --> 32:32.640]  they don't want us to remember what political action did and that's why the
[32:32.640 --> 32:37.040]  globalist Hillary and others are trying to shut inforrs down this is a fight
[32:37.040 --> 32:42.120]  about taking your speech away not just my speech about taking your very sovereignty
[32:42.120 --> 32:46.880]  away this country is in a war so again I want to thank you for what you've done
[32:46.880 --> 32:50.120]  but I want to remind you if you don't spread the articles of videos and if
[32:50.120 --> 32:53.520]  you don't financially get the great products we have and fund us and the
[32:53.520 --> 32:58.560]  360 win we're dead in the water I'm in your hands you're in my hands infowarstore.com
[32:58.560 --> 33:01.160]  thank you
[33:01.160 --> 33:25.720]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[33:25.720 --> 33:32.240]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance live from the
[33:32.240 --> 33:58.200]  info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones
[33:58.200 --> 34:05.520]  I want to be completely clear here to infinitive I don't get up here and
[34:05.520 --> 34:11.280]  rattle off a bunch of negative information to you to demoralize you or
[34:11.280 --> 34:16.680]  to scare you I get up here and I talk about these issues because I know
[34:16.680 --> 34:21.960]  historically but also at a gut level and I've experienced it myself that when
[34:21.960 --> 34:26.840]  the general public hears the truth about what's really going on and it's just
[34:26.840 --> 34:32.120]  laid out instead of just kind of rolled out real slow that people get upset and
[34:32.120 --> 34:36.520]  they do something about it and they change it and we've seen that happen on
[34:36.520 --> 34:40.600]  so many different fronts when they're sure to ban our guns and we stand up and
[34:40.600 --> 34:45.320]  they fail or they're sure to have their carbon tax and transfer congressional
[34:45.320 --> 34:51.640]  power to the TPP this global government body and the public stands up and we
[34:51.640 --> 34:56.440]  get pulled out of it or globalism and world government in trouble all over
[34:56.440 --> 35:03.240]  the planet that's because people talked about the world government they talked
[35:03.240 --> 35:06.400]  about the global government system didn't matter we got ridiculed or attacked
[35:06.400 --> 35:13.680]  we relaunched you relaunched populism and we're seen as the main enemy of the
[35:13.680 --> 35:19.320]  globalist info wars because we're a focal point for you to get the word out
[35:19.320 --> 35:24.120]  we're a focal point for people to know that we're not alone and then in most
[35:24.120 --> 35:32.560]  nations nationalist and free market populism is the majority idea of hard
[35:32.560 --> 35:39.560]  working people from blue collar to white collar to new vorace and it's the old
[35:39.560 --> 35:45.040]  money and the establishment that wants a monopoly and they're the ones at war
[35:45.040 --> 35:51.600]  with the family the individual and with God because these elites want to be God
[35:51.600 --> 35:59.120]  themselves so when I get into the negative horrors of Governor Northam
[35:59.120 --> 36:03.200]  I've got all this other news and all these other interesting clips why do I go
[36:03.200 --> 36:08.360]  back to that because I saw him come out and say that and Trump tweet about it
[36:08.360 --> 36:12.880]  and it become the number one story and I said that guy is gonna be destroyed
[36:12.880 --> 36:17.440]  soon they're gonna find some other dirt and focus in on that as a distraction
[36:17.440 --> 36:22.040]  I've learned how their tactics work and sure enough they had that blackface and
[36:22.040 --> 36:29.640]  the KKK crap for years that's why they ran him it's why they would do that in
[36:29.640 --> 36:34.320]  your books at that time was to was people would set themselves up on purpose
[36:34.320 --> 36:41.880]  saying I'm here to be compromised that's how fraternities work especially the
[36:41.880 --> 36:46.440]  so-called elite ones because everybody's seen you have sex with a goat and they
[36:46.440 --> 36:53.400]  took Polaroids you get compromised on purpose it's a gang initiation whether
[36:53.400 --> 36:57.680]  it's sculling bones or whether it's ms-13
[36:58.520 --> 37:02.080]  and a Christian culture what's the most taboo thing you can do
[37:02.080 --> 37:07.640]  Satanism so it's sculling bones and ms-13 look it up both groups do say
[37:07.640 --> 37:17.560]  tannic rituals to join it always goes back to the same thing doesn't it so I
[37:17.560 --> 37:23.680]  talk about Northam it's because they don't want Northam in the news he refused
[37:23.680 --> 37:27.960]  to resign he's now doing a tour where he teaches everyone to be obsessed with
[37:27.960 --> 37:33.240]  racism and he's the moral authority who refuses to leave because he's so moral
[37:33.240 --> 37:38.440]  and I'm gonna say it again they're keeping babies alive after they're born
[37:38.440 --> 37:43.920]  and these medical boards who follow something called bioethics that replace
[37:43.920 --> 37:50.440]  the Hippocratic oath in the last 20 years in the Western world these boards
[37:50.440 --> 37:56.120]  decide who lives and who dies not just babies not just children not just old
[37:56.120 --> 38:01.920]  people everybody so they can usurp your living will they can usurp your
[38:01.920 --> 38:07.040]  directives they can usurp your rights and that's where many areas of Europe
[38:07.040 --> 38:12.200]  have already gotten for they're killing people that come in off the street and
[38:12.200 --> 38:18.720]  say I'm depressed an hour later they're dead and then next we're gonna kill you
[38:18.720 --> 38:22.840]  cuz we say your life isn't worth anything you know everybody overuses
[38:22.840 --> 38:28.760]  Hitler but when it actually came from Hitler we'll tell you Volkswagen Audi
[38:28.760 --> 38:36.560]  the modern Olympics the Olympic symbol the space program
[38:36.560 --> 38:43.880]  Autobahn highways superhighways Autobahn touring cars all out of Hitler's
[38:43.880 --> 38:54.120]  brain he was definitely a futurist and they set up something called medical
[38:54.120 --> 39:02.280]  bioethics in 1934 by 35 they were killing retarded children by 36 they were
[39:02.280 --> 39:07.120]  killing perfectly healthy children by 37 they were grabbing people out the
[39:07.120 --> 39:11.960]  street taking them to mental institutions where they would die by 38 39
[39:11.960 --> 39:16.840]  they were arresting people by the tens of thousands and by 1943 they were
[39:16.840 --> 39:24.160]  killing millions of people a year in death camps I read it in the Nazi books I
[39:24.160 --> 39:32.280]  know it's not a conspiracy theory Hitler wrote up the final solution now the
[39:32.280 --> 39:37.080]  EU was a Hitler plan all of it was a Hitler plan but Hitler was trained by
[39:37.080 --> 39:41.680]  the Cold Springs Harbor facility in New York and the Rockefeller Foundation
[39:41.680 --> 39:47.200]  that on record funded the Kaiser Velom Institute with Margaret Sanger who was
[39:47.200 --> 39:53.360]  Hitler's advisor Hitler gave her the highest award a German or non-German
[39:53.360 --> 39:59.800]  could get and he gave the same award to Thomas Watson the head of IBM for
[39:59.800 --> 40:07.680]  helping run the death camps so pulling back ladies and gentlemen here let's
[40:07.680 --> 40:18.160]  type in IBM in the Holocaust when you hear the governor of Virginia talking
[40:18.160 --> 40:21.720]  about keeping babies comfortable they're saying there's no more law there's no
[40:21.720 --> 40:27.160]  more courts the medical system besides who lives and dies that is directly from
[40:27.160 --> 40:31.960]  the Nazis it's where they did their first power grab so when you hear about
[40:31.960 --> 40:37.160]  forced inoculations are you here about killing babies after they're born for
[40:37.160 --> 40:43.120]  every excuse they've got this is a usurping of law just like we did here
[40:43.120 --> 40:46.800]  in the 20s and 30s and 40s when they sterilize poor people and some folks
[40:46.800 --> 40:55.960]  disappeared and died as well this was all set up here now I'm gonna go to a
[40:55.960 --> 41:03.560]  short clip since I mentioned it of the governor again saying we killed the
[41:03.560 --> 41:08.960]  babies after they're born and people can't come to grips with this they can't
[41:08.960 --> 41:13.200]  come to face it because they know it's wrong they can make it up before the
[41:13.200 --> 41:16.880]  baby's born now it's already born how is this happening so people can't oppose
[41:16.880 --> 41:20.000]  it because it must not be true even though it's happening and then we come
[41:20.000 --> 41:28.040]  back as Paul Harvey would say the rest of the story San Diego pathologist
[41:28.040 --> 41:31.840]  accused of improperly harvesting children's organs San Diego Union
[41:31.840 --> 41:37.520]  tribune here is the governor there are you know when we talk about third
[41:37.520 --> 41:43.360]  trimester abortions these are done with the consent of obviously the mother
[41:43.360 --> 41:48.920]  with the consent of the physicians more than one physician by the way and it's
[41:48.920 --> 41:53.680]  done in cases where there may be severe deformities there may be a fetus
[41:53.680 --> 41:58.880]  that's non-viable so in this particular example if a mother is in labor I can
[41:58.880 --> 42:04.280]  tell you exactly what would happen the infant would be delivered the infant
[42:04.280 --> 42:08.800]  would be kept comfortable the infant would be resuscitated if that's what
[42:08.800 --> 42:13.160]  the mother and the family desired and then a discussion would ensue between
[42:13.160 --> 42:17.440]  the physicians and the mother so I think this was really blown out of
[42:17.440 --> 42:21.080]  proportion that's blown out of proportion of course we can put behind me on
[42:21.080 --> 42:25.840]  screen IBM and the Holocaust you know read all about that so that's the
[42:25.840 --> 42:29.680]  reality and when we come back I'm gonna finish up with this and I'm gonna tie it
[42:29.680 --> 42:34.080]  in to CBS News and others reporting that soon we'll all have brain chips so
[42:34.080 --> 42:36.880]  we've gone from crazy people say there's gonna be a global government with
[42:36.880 --> 42:40.280]  brain chips to oh you're all gonna have your brain chip and Google's gonna run
[42:40.280 --> 42:44.560]  it but if you're not a good globalist we'll just turn access to your brain
[42:44.560 --> 42:50.640]  ship off that's all mainstream news it's all coming up so get the news of 20

[48:04.480 --> 48:13.160]  central standard time every day so we're seeing human life being devalued kill
[48:13.160 --> 48:16.560]  the old people kill the unborn now kill babies after they're born they were
[48:16.560 --> 48:21.600]  always warned that's where this lead now we're told bestiality is a great thing
[48:21.600 --> 48:25.760]  pay for people sex changes let the folks that have had the sex changes come in and
[48:25.760 --> 48:30.640]  talk to your five-year-olds about what their sex should be it's not called
[48:30.640 --> 48:35.360]  being perverted or pedophilia it's called liberal and then we have the
[48:35.360 --> 48:39.640]  Pentagon going back decades but now mainstream news implanting chips and
[48:39.640 --> 48:47.800]  troops brains to help them not be depressed or have PTSD and then we
[48:47.800 --> 48:52.600]  learned a few months ago that there have been gene-edited babies and babies being
[48:52.600 --> 48:56.120]  born in China that weren't weren't from two parents but that were from four or
[48:56.120 --> 49:03.040]  five people that's not a human that's a humanoid but don't worry we're not
[49:03.040 --> 49:05.720]  having a debate about whether they have rights or not because they're in a no
[49:05.720 --> 49:12.440]  man's land and now we learn those edited babies have super intelligences but
[49:12.440 --> 49:16.640]  really everything the globalist gives us the cell phones the GMO everything they
[49:16.640 --> 49:21.520]  give us that supposedly gonna enhances makes us stupider makes us lazier makes
[49:21.520 --> 49:25.280]  us more depressed and ruins our humanity because all the technology were
[49:25.280 --> 49:31.840]  given is given with Trojan horse back doors for a real reason the story is up
[49:31.840 --> 49:38.240]  on info wars.com it's from CBS news we're gonna play clip of it right now
[49:38.240 --> 49:44.800]  Northwestern neuroscientist researching brain chips to make people super
[49:44.800 --> 49:52.120]  intelligent that's right and then it says that you'll dial in and the other
[49:52.120 --> 49:58.400]  report I have to a Google master system worldwide where you interface with the
[49:58.400 --> 50:04.320]  AI and then it knows everything you're thinking but then you're able to access
[50:04.320 --> 50:08.160]  what other people are supposedly thinking can you imagine that even if this
[50:08.160 --> 50:13.880]  worked how it would make you the ultimate scatterbrain unable to focus or of
[50:13.880 --> 50:17.880]  course it's not designed to work how it will actually take control of your mind
[50:17.880 --> 50:21.800]  you'll think you're omnipresent you'll think you're all powerful you'll think
[50:21.800 --> 50:26.080]  you've got godlike powers but really it'll just be tapping in to your endorphin
[50:26.080 --> 50:31.680]  regions like a PKD cyberpunk wirehead and you'll be nothing but a rat with a
[50:31.680 --> 50:36.400]  wire plugged into its brain it'll now shine off to lose its body for the
[50:36.400 --> 50:39.880]  greater good of the earth and to give up your carbon-based form for a silicon
[50:39.880 --> 50:43.720]  form and upload to the godlike machine in the sky which is what I told you
[50:43.720 --> 50:49.000]  decades ago was the plan and now it's all over the news yes yes you can be
[50:49.000 --> 50:53.000]  immortal but you must give up your body you can be immortal but you must give up
[50:53.000 --> 50:59.760]  your humanity that's the promise we must get rid of the humans and then those of
[50:59.760 --> 51:05.080]  you that become this new life form can merge with this master intelligence so
[51:05.080 --> 51:09.560]  like a ghost in the machine keeps directing us to build this anti-human
[51:09.560 --> 51:15.720]  nightmare future so here's CBS news on how wonderful brain chips are what if
[51:15.720 --> 51:19.760]  you could make money or type something just by thinking about it sounds like
[51:19.760 --> 51:24.280]  sci-fi but it may be close to reality CBS 2 Morning Insider Lauren victory shows
[51:24.280 --> 51:27.440]  us the Chicago connection
[51:27.440 --> 51:32.080]  neuroscience and business he's got lots of matter all over his home in the not
[51:32.080 --> 51:37.880]  so distant future on his mind will they be humans in as little as five years
[51:37.880 --> 51:43.120]  super smart people could be walking down the street and in women who've paid to
[51:43.120 --> 51:47.240]  increase their intelligence neuroscientist moron surf makes that
[51:47.240 --> 51:51.520]  prediction because he's working on a smart chip for the brain make it so that
[51:51.520 --> 51:55.240]  it has an internet connection and goes to Wikipedia and when I think this
[51:55.240 --> 51:58.560]  particular thought gives me the answer the Northwestern University business
[51:58.560 --> 52:03.120]  professors collaborating with Silicon Valley big wigs he'd rather not name so
[52:03.120 --> 52:08.640]  what if you could type directly from your brain we know Facebook is chipping
[52:08.640 --> 52:13.040]  away at this Tesla founder Elon Musk is to everyone is spending a lot of time
[52:13.040 --> 52:16.240]  right now we're trying to find ways to get things into the brain without
[52:16.240 --> 52:19.680]  drilling a hole in your skull can you eat something that will actually get to
[52:19.680 --> 52:24.080]  your brain can you eat things in parts that will assemble inside your head
[52:24.080 --> 52:28.560]  mind-blowing but relationships could be on the line this is no longer a science
[52:28.560 --> 52:33.080]  problem this is a social problem surf worries about creating intelligence gaps
[52:33.080 --> 52:38.040]  in our society that's on top of gender racial and financial inequalities they
[52:38.040 --> 52:42.280]  can make money by just thinking about the right investments and we cannot so
[52:42.280 --> 52:45.040]  so they're gonna get richer they're gonna get healthier they're gonna live
[52:45.040 --> 52:51.400]  longer the IQ of an intelligent ape is about 70 the average human 100 a genius
[52:51.400 --> 52:57.000]  around 140 people with smart chips 200 will they even want to interact with us
[52:57.000 --> 53:00.880]  they're gonna say look at this cute human Stephen Hawking he can do the
[53:00.880 --> 53:05.440]  question equations in his mind just like a little baby with you know 160 IQ
[53:05.440 --> 53:07.800]  point is amazing it's so cute now let's put it back in a cage and give it
[53:07.800 --> 53:19.840]  bananas time will tell or will our minds or in victory CBS 2 news so that
[53:19.840 --> 53:25.080]  individual just said exactly what Rick Kurzweil says what all the other quote
[53:25.080 --> 53:31.680]  transhumanist trans future to say oh we'll be like gods you'll be like animals
[53:31.680 --> 53:39.080]  we'll even keep us around like a monkey in a cage or an insect or a turtle in a
[53:39.080 --> 53:43.240]  terrarium and you you're just gonna want this and it's gonna be great and
[53:43.240 --> 53:47.760]  everybody's just gonna join with it the internet was built to track everything
[53:47.760 --> 53:51.760]  you do to create a super computer that could predict the future that would then
[53:51.760 --> 53:55.240]  have inputs directly into your life surveilling you and controlling you
[53:55.240 --> 54:01.160]  finally in your brain to take control of your consciousness this is a
[54:01.160 --> 54:08.920]  synthetic matrix takeover DARPA in the 60s drew up plans for us to live in
[54:08.920 --> 54:14.360]  energy tanks from birth powering the earth with our own heat plugged in
[54:14.360 --> 54:18.640]  living in a virtual reality and that that would be the future the matrix is
[54:18.640 --> 54:23.440]  based on that the matrix is the real plan or one of several competing
[54:23.440 --> 54:28.720]  plan plans where they actually still keep humans alive but all of it is to
[54:28.720 --> 54:34.960]  seduce us and to trick us into going along with this and accepting and sure
[54:34.960 --> 54:38.320]  if you've been in a motorcycle accident you've got a brain chip like my uncle
[54:38.320 --> 54:44.040]  that keeps him from having horrible seizures it's great now when he starts
[54:44.040 --> 54:47.840]  having a seizure he starts talking like a robot they'll be like well I tell you
[54:47.840 --> 54:56.960]  everything's fine yeah actually I'm doing better now wow yeah that just
[54:56.960 --> 55:01.560]  stopped a major I mean he has big grand mall seizures and they've devastated his
[55:01.560 --> 55:05.040]  body but since he got the brain chip he's fine but he'll just be sitting there
[55:05.040 --> 55:08.240]  talking to you all sudden this isn't just a chip to a nerve he's got a brain
[55:08.240 --> 55:14.200]  chip and he'll start having a seizure he talks like a robot because he's

[01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:35.240]  all right here's what I want to do
[01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:40.360]  Paul Watson has been a very busy beaver at CPAC he flew in late last night to
[01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:43.680]  Austin tweeted he'd be here today he's not here which is fine I'll be here the
[01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:47.080]  next three four days he's studio a lot with us and I've got a lot of clips a
[01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:50.480]  lot of news to get to I'm sure Paul probably show up soon he's not answering
[01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:59.440]  his phone I want to go back and look at a congressional report four years ago
[01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:05.720]  that the the the leftist press demonized that was Tom delay a Justice
[01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:08.720]  Department wants to legalize 12 perversions turns out that was accurate
[01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:12.400]  and that was true the newsmax was accurate so we're gonna be getting to
[01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:16.960]  that report next we'll also look at the new attacks on the president the latest
[01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:23.760]  on AOC and more but first Venezuela America's illegal wars and the cost of
[01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:30.320]  freedom here's part of Greg Reese's report after the twin towers were felled
[01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:35.960]  into dust and rubble the illegal neo-counter agenda of regime change was
[01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:42.040]  unleashed upon the unwitting targets of the Federal Reserve system the plan was
[01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:48.440]  to use 9-11 as a catalyst to topple the governments of seven countries I just
[01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:51.160]  got this memo from the Secretary of Defense's office says we're gonna attack
[01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:56.400]  and destroy the governments in seven countries in five years we're gonna
[01:01:56.400 --> 01:02:01.240]  start with Iraq and then we're gonna move to Syria Lebanon Libya Somalia Sudan
[01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:08.880]  and Iran the neocons lied their way into Iraq with imaginary tales of so-called
[01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:12.520]  weapons of mass destruction those weapons of mass destruction got to be
[01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:19.520]  somewhere and as the world watched the sovereign nation of Iraq fall a new
[01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:25.280]  precedent was set during the Obama presidency the anti-war movement
[01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:30.960]  disappeared and illegal aggression became so commonplace that Americans now
[01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:38.880]  criticize the president of the US for wanting to end wars there is now much
[01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:44.400]  talk about Venezuela the fundamental principle that governments must rest on
[01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:49.240]  the consent of the governed has been at the foundation of Venezuelan democracy
[01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:56.800]  since 1958 and any credible reading of the Constitution shows that Maduro is
[01:02:56.800 --> 01:03:04.040]  not reelected in 2018 in direct violation of the Venezuelan Constitution
[01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:10.800]  Maduro organized an illegal election the Maduro government banned opposition
[01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:15.400]  political parties candidates and leaders from running in the election
[01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:20.920]  illegally imprisoned opposition leaders before the election coerced and
[01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:25.840]  intimidated citizens into voting for the president's party engaged in
[01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:31.240]  verifiable manipulation of vote tallies organized the process through an
[01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:36.200]  election authority controlled by members of Maduro's party murdered
[01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:42.200]  protesters who exercised their right to assemble peacefully engaged in widespread
[01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:47.800]  illegal use of government funds to finance Maduro's campaign used state
[01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:52.760]  owned media to promote Maduro's candidacy and disallowed international
[01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:58.760]  organizations from observing the vote according to the Constitution in a
[01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:03.360]  situation with no president the president of the National Assembly shall
[01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:08.880]  take charge of the presidency of the Republic under the Constitution Juan
[01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:14.520]  Guaidó is the De Jure president of Venezuela although Maduro is in
[01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:20.280]  de facto control the international community has overwhelmingly rejected it
[01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:26.200]  as an illegal election this seems different than the regime change of the
[01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:33.200]  Bush and Obama years the leftists love the brutality and hypocrisy of Maduro's
[01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:38.360]  illegal regime and many on the right would love to help the people of
[01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:45.480]  Venezuela restore law and order the question is what legal authority does
[01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:51.360]  the U.S. have to get involved that's just part of a very thoughtful very

[01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:25.520]  all right in this hour I'm gonna cover the waterfront and take your phone calls
[01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:33.480]  and I legitimately want to ask listeners a question two questions what do you
[01:06:33.480 --> 01:06:38.200]  think Trump should do with this national emergency now that Rand Paul and
[01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:42.280]  others have been suckered into an improper interpretation of the
[01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:46.360]  Constitution of the president can't declare an emergency when the border is
[01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:52.640]  under threat that's in the Constitution that's the president and you've got a
[01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:57.280]  lot of people saying hey let's not topple the dictatorship in Venezuela
[01:06:57.280 --> 01:07:01.080]  even though it threatens the US and surrounding countries and it's collapsing
[01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:08.040]  and the people are begging for it people saying don't do it and I tend to
[01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:13.600]  not want regime change where we overthrow some ally like Egypt and put
[01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:19.920]  al-Qaeda or ISIS or the Muslim Brotherhood in but if we just stand by and
[01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:24.320]  let a thousand plus people start to death in Venezuela and it's in northern
[01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:28.360]  South America and causes a collapse into the US border which the UN is
[01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:33.400]  helping foment that's a real territorial threat to the US and a real
[01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:43.160]  national interest cut and dry that's first year geopolitics but here's why I
[01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:47.200]  may be actually against it in fact I think I am against a Venezuelan
[01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:51.760]  intervention I've really thought about this I've meditated I've cogitated I've
[01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:59.680]  dwelled on it I don't trust the neocons running this hemispheres policies
[01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:03.400]  prompts put them in there I understand why they've got all the connections down
[01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:07.720]  there they helped run regime changes before they're the only competent people
[01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:12.400]  my competent doesn't mean I agree with them but they're very competent they're
[01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:17.000]  not stupid they're very smart they're very learned they're very studied they're
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:27.320]  very focused they're very hard-working they're not lazy dombo's and they would
[01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:30.720]  know how to cause this transition and then put a good government in there
[01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:34.920]  where people actually vote for it but neocons never do that they want to use
[01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:39.280]  it as a larger crisis and they'll put in a right-wing fascist government they'll
[01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:43.280]  then fund leftist arms in that government to then topple surrounding
[01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:48.400]  countries and bring down the whole region no good can come out of neocons
[01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:54.000]  the entire destroyed Middle East all of it is their baby and we have the seven
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:09:01.600]  nation takedown plan that got leaked you know 15 years ago by Wesley Clark and
[01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:05.800]  others so we know destabilization the neocons are involved in plot in
[01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:09.240]  imploding Europe's borders they're involved in the censorship that they
[01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:15.520]  run it the you think the Democrats with AOC and Pelosi and Michael Moore are
[01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:21.440]  competent no the neocons are the brain of the new world order they funded the
[01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:25.040]  Arab Spring they funded ISIS and al-Qaeda and the takeovers of the Middle
[01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:28.400]  East Trump came in and blocked it
[01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:33.480]  hell our Pentagon did that and said no the neocons six seven years ago and
[01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:41.800]  Rand Paul did the right thing then Rand Paul said it was wrong Rand Paul said
[01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:45.240]  we're not gonna be al-Qaeda's Air Force and then ISIS's Air Force and so did
[01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:51.720]  Ted Cruz and so those are really the big questions there and so now that I
[01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:54.880]  really pull back I don't want Venezuela collapsing I don't want it
[01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:59.520]  collapsing into Central America and then into the US and Mexico and I want to
[01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:03.720]  help those people and I know that the opposition leader was elected according
[01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:08.400]  to Constitution and I'm sure he's probably a good guy but did you think
[01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:13.800]  Trump can really control the neocons to not just exacerbate the problem make it
[01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:19.520]  worse oh and let's go further the Bay of Pigs right after Kennedy gets in office
[01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:23.200]  the CIA wants to get control of him they convinced him to launch this
[01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:29.280]  operation and then they don't let the the air cover show up the operations
[01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:34.760]  maybe one tenth of one percent as big as it should been totally doomed to fail
[01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:41.960]  maybe a thousand people against a half million troops the CIA had run through
[01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:46.440]  El Castro before he visited New York he was the Abraham Lincoln of the Caribbean
[01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:52.120]  blah blah blah this whole thing was a double-crossed setup because the
[01:10:52.120 --> 01:10:57.080]  globalist wanted to use Cuba later for a war with the Soviet Union that came out
[01:10:57.080 --> 01:11:01.960]  in Operation Northwoods Kennedy wanted peace but wanted to be strong so they
[01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:12.320]  staged the Bay of Pigs the Bay of Swine to embarrass Kennedy and that later was
[01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:19.360]  declassified so do you think the neocons if Trump gets into a war that's got his
[01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:24.600]  name on it they're going to be waiting Maduro with their anti-aircraft guns and
[01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:30.760]  missiles when the troops come in they're going to be waiting and they're going to
[01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:35.480]  let them absolutely create huge casualties and they're gonna say that
[01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:40.440]  Trump is incompetent and it just hit me last night and it hit me as I was doing
[01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:44.280]  the broadcast hey get into that that gut level these globalists that aren't
[01:11:44.280 --> 01:11:49.520]  American either the high-level CIA or British Empire type global corporate
[01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:52.600]  types sell us out the China types and they're pissed that Trump wants to make
[01:11:52.600 --> 01:12:00.800]  America first and they will a hundred percent give Trump a defeat if he tries
[01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:07.000]  to go into Venezuela so I am now against Venezuela regime change because I
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:13.560]  don't trust the neocons because I've never seen them do anything good because
[01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:19.120]  they come out of evil Leon Trotsky was number two in the Soviet Union and
[01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:23.200]  ran the persecution and murder of millions of Christians and others and
[01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:31.200]  what Stalin threw his butt out he went to Mexico and his number one aide was
[01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:35.760]  mr. crystal William crystals father and when he died the head of the Communist
[01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:41.240]  Party Party in the US was what became national review and everything else
[01:12:41.240 --> 01:12:49.760]  today and these folks are bad news and they mean business when I say business I
[01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:55.640]  mean capital B they said we can't be conservatives we can't be Christians we
[01:12:55.640 --> 01:13:00.760]  got to lead them and because Russia threw us out we've got to get the US
[01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:06.600]  completely against Russia and that's all of what you saw that came after that was
[01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:11.280]  and it didn't mean Russia was Russia had been taken over by Trotskyite types
[01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:15.600]  proto Trotskyites and because the Trotskyites got thrown out they were
[01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:21.520]  pissed Russia was already put into a communist system turned evil and bad but
[01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:34.440]  the Trotskyites weren't running it anymore so they were movie angry and so
[01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:38.120]  that's the reality I'd love to see regime change I feel so bad for Venezuela a
[01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:42.240]  lot of great people but I just don't think we can get involved because because
[01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:49.520]  you can't trust the people that are running these operations they just can't
[01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:52.760]  put a country to let it be in power they have a free market nation it would
[01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:55.360]  then spread over Latin America they can't allow that to happen
[01:13:55.360 --> 01:14:00.120]  Latin America used to be as rich as we were 50 years ago 60 years ago they're
[01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:05.840]  not going to allow it the globalist want destabilization here as well am I
[01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:10.600]  wrong and the other big thing Rand Paul I love Rand Paul really smart guy but
[01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:14.360]  he's getting brownie points like he did back in the campaign from Lepus media
[01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:18.720]  oh the president can't you sharp the power of the purse from Congress only if
[01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:23.440]  it's in acts of war or the border or insurrection and I agree that he shouldn't
[01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:27.440]  have gone with the 76 law that does it via law enforcement and all this he
[01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:30.960]  should have done as commander-in-chief you better damn believe the president
[01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:34.520]  outside of Congress could spend any amount of money or put the troops or
[01:14:34.520 --> 01:14:40.960]  call out the militia on the border that is sacrosanct cut-and-dry and under the
[01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:46.560]  76 law with all the 36 other emergencies and they're saying this one
[01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:52.680]  didn't come up to muster when it's the most clear cut-and-dry one so Rand Paul
[01:14:52.680 --> 01:14:56.560]  I guess mr. Constitution and mr. civil liberty but then sometimes he listens to
[01:14:56.560 --> 01:14:59.520]  the left they're trying to trample the Bill of Rights and Constitution right of
[01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:03.040]  the free speech where the 2nd Amendment 4th Amendment 10th Amendment 7th
[01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:07.400]  Amendment 9th Amendment hell Trump here's the key why I trust Trump on this
[01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:11.480]  he pulled us out of the trans-pacific partnership that they worked on for
[01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:14.640]  decades that Hillary helped write to transfer sovereignty to global
[01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:18.240]  government why wasn't Congress pissed about signing the power of the purse over
[01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:23.000]  to some foggy secret world government group with the chai comms involved no he
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:27.840]  killed it he brought the power back here and the president has the power to
[01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:32.760]  take clearly our borders under attack by giant UN organized caravans being to
[01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:36.080]  break our border and break our courts where the Democrats trying to say we
[01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:40.400]  can only hold 16,000 people on these beds once they break the border it's over
[01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:45.240]  like Europe so the president better damn well declare the emergency he'd be
[01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:48.280]  derelict in his duty if he hadn't done it

[01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:47.720]  you just joined us is Rand Paul right to say Trump's national emergency to defend
[01:21:47.720 --> 01:21:52.600]  the border is unconstitutional when it's right in the Constitution the president
[01:21:52.600 --> 01:21:55.880]  will defend the border I think Trump didn't go far enough he should have done
[01:21:55.880 --> 01:22:02.880]  his commander-in-chief with the military and the budget we've always said pull
[01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:06.640]  our troops out all these foreign countries and defend our border and then
[01:22:06.640 --> 01:22:12.040]  right as the full UN assault happens Trump tries to do it and then his own
[01:22:12.040 --> 01:22:20.360]  party I've got the headlines right here that Trump races for GOP rebellion over
[01:22:20.360 --> 01:22:28.720]  emergency declaration the Hill Democrats prepare for end of Robert Muller probe
[01:22:28.720 --> 01:22:34.000]  with new investigations US House panel launches probe into possible
[01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:45.280]  destruction by Trump think about that this country's fighting for its life
[01:22:45.280 --> 01:22:51.200]  meanwhile we've seen Indian aircraft getting shot down missiles being fired
[01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:56.080]  what could start the next world war most analysts agree is going to be Pakistan
[01:22:56.080 --> 01:23:01.360]  and India tensions ease between India and Pakistan a key train service between
[01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:05.280]  Pakistan India resumed on Monday settling an easing of tensions between the two
[01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:11.080]  nuclear armed countries after a major escalation of tension last week over the
[01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:16.440]  disputed Kashmir region cold start India's answer to Pakistan nuclear
[01:23:16.440 --> 01:23:20.880]  bullying cold start as India's military doctrine aimed at punishing Pakistan
[01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:26.200]  without a full-blown nuclear war ex-US ambassador to Pakistan praises Trump's
[01:23:26.200 --> 01:23:33.000]  quiet diplomacy in India Pakistan dispute India Pakistan tensions who won the
[01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:37.200]  war of perceptions as confrontation on the ground escalated India Pakistan
[01:23:37.200 --> 01:23:42.200]  scrambled to control domestic and international narratives India had
[01:23:42.200 --> 01:23:47.200]  planned a missile attack in Pakistan India had planned missile attacks of
[01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:52.640]  Pakistan on Islamabad had received intelligence report sources said Monday
[01:23:52.640 --> 01:23:57.760]  sources said India and Israel wanted to target Pakistan adding that following
[01:23:57.760 --> 01:24:02.720]  intelligence reports Pakistan sort of their planned missile attack India was
[01:24:02.720 --> 01:24:07.560]  informed that Pakistan would respond if missile strikes was carried out against
[01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:11.680]  it sources said India's two planned attacks were foiled following
[01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:16.640]  intelligence reports sources said and added that Pakistan had shared Indian
[01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:21.600]  planned to target Pakistan with friendly countries and told them and their
[01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:25.120]  international community that Islamabad wants peace with New Delhi Indian
[01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:29.120]  forces are unable to enter Pakistan territory however there is fear India
[01:24:29.120 --> 01:24:36.120]  could plan a terrorist attack inside Pakistan the sources say and it just
[01:24:36.120 --> 01:24:39.000]  goes on from there with the Indian aircraft shot down the rest of it as
[01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:44.240]  this stuff continues to get out of control and of course since the Indian
[01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:48.200]  jets were shot down they've shot down a Pakistani drone the two countries have
[01:24:48.200 --> 01:24:51.440]  been at war with each other off and on for a long time Pakistan used to be part
[01:24:51.440 --> 01:24:58.520]  of India so we've got the national emergency that Republicans are set to
[01:24:58.520 --> 01:25:02.600]  pass a vote on with the Democrats and then Trump will veto it because it won't
[01:25:02.600 --> 01:25:08.600]  be a two-thirds majority his first veto and you've got the situation in
[01:25:08.600 --> 01:25:12.440]  Venezuela where I think you can't trust the neocons to have good regime change
[01:25:12.440 --> 01:25:17.920]  there sure Maduro's a dictator yeah he got voted out okay get rid of him but the
[01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:23.760]  neocons always put in something just as bad because they're evil leopards don't
[01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:29.800]  grow new spots their spots don't change so where do you stand on that I want to
[01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:33.000]  get listeners expert take and I mean expert it's always enjoy hearing from
[01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:37.120]  you on that subject and of course the whole India situation we can throw in
[01:25:37.120 --> 01:25:41.560]  there Trump walking away from the disarmament deal with North Korea we
[01:25:41.560 --> 01:25:44.440]  already got him to get rid of a bunch of their bases we already got him stop
[01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:47.520]  doing missile tests and threatening the whole region we already got him to move
[01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:52.320]  the ball down the field this time he didn't move the ball so Trump left if
[01:25:52.320 --> 01:25:56.440]  Trump would have given concessions for nothing he would have been a traitor a
[01:25:56.440 --> 01:26:02.760]  loser but he did he went and he tried he failed but at least he tried in the
[01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:08.520]  arena for that old quote from Teddy Roosevelt so what's your view on that as
[01:26:08.520 --> 01:26:14.040]  well your phone calls when we come back on the other side that said we've got a
[01:26:14.040 --> 01:26:19.680]  big special on our bodies ultimate turmeric formula that is about to end
[01:26:19.680 --> 01:26:25.480]  this week because we're close to selling out bodies bodies is the strongest
[01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:29.440]  turmeric formula you're gonna find 95% of humanoids there may be a few other

[01:33:13.680 --> 01:33:18.680]  there's a lot of controversy around this network about alex jones for example
[01:33:18.680 --> 01:33:28.680]  alex jones the far-right conspiracy theorist who is a parent
[01:33:32.680 --> 01:33:36.680]  alex jones
[01:33:36.680 --> 01:33:42.680]  stop Russian stop
[01:33:43.680 --> 01:33:47.680]  info wars comes to mind
[01:33:48.680 --> 01:33:56.680]  reputation's amazing I will not let you down you'll be very very impressed I hope
[01:33:56.680 --> 01:34:06.680]  alex jones
[01:34:07.680 --> 01:34:17.680]  alex jones
[01:34:17.680 --> 01:34:27.680]  alex jones
[01:34:35.680 --> 01:34:40.680]  Juan Guaido the opposition leader that most believe actually won the election
[01:34:40.680 --> 01:34:44.680]  last year in Venezuela has returned home from Colombia amongst massive
[01:34:44.680 --> 01:34:49.680]  demonstrations of support but also attacks about to go to your phone calls
[01:34:49.680 --> 01:34:55.680]  right now again on should we be involved in Venezuela even if we did the
[01:34:55.680 --> 01:35:00.680]  neo-console sabotage it to make Trump look bad and to destabilize the region
[01:35:00.680 --> 01:35:04.680]  it's what they do they're evil just like the Democrats what about India
[01:35:04.680 --> 01:35:08.680]  Pakistan what about North Korea what about the national emergency with ran
[01:35:08.680 --> 01:35:12.680]  Paul coming out and saying he doesn't support it I'm almost always aligned with
[01:35:12.680 --> 01:35:16.680]  ran Paul but he did some of this during the campaign where he'd go along with the
[01:35:16.680 --> 01:35:21.680]  mainstream media and I've read the Constitution the president is in charge
[01:35:21.680 --> 01:35:25.680]  of the border but he's just where the commander-in-chief at instead of going
[01:35:25.680 --> 01:35:30.680]  along with that 76 law that allows him to use other areas of the budget
[01:35:30.680 --> 01:35:35.680]  than what Congress allows just do it as the commander-in-chief then he'd have
[01:35:35.680 --> 01:35:40.680]  support but regardless Trump got us out of the TPP Trump for pulling us out of
[01:35:40.680 --> 01:35:43.680]  these foreign treaties that sold our sovereignty he's bringing power back to
[01:35:43.680 --> 01:35:48.680]  the US back to our country so I wish Congress would have had more energy to
[01:35:48.680 --> 01:35:52.680]  go after the TPP that transferred the power of the purse to multinational
[01:35:52.680 --> 01:35:56.680]  governments and corporations but now they're so upset because Trump's
[01:35:56.680 --> 01:36:00.680]  going to defend the border what do the listeners think they've got Stu and
[01:36:00.680 --> 01:36:04.680]  John and John and Chris and Ken and Robert and Dennis and Steve and
[01:36:04.680 --> 01:36:10.680]  Jefferson and John and Georgia and let's talk to Georgia and first from the
[01:36:10.680 --> 01:36:16.680]  great state of Tennessee Georgia and thanks for calling thanks Alex I know
[01:36:16.680 --> 01:36:20.680]  you've been through a hard time it's it's gonna get rough for I hate to tell
[01:36:20.680 --> 01:36:26.680]  you as far as Rand Paul goes I don't have a problem with him saying what he
[01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:31.680]  wants we have too much censorship now if that's the way he feels I think he's
[01:36:31.680 --> 01:36:36.680]  pretty well supported Trump I like Trump I've supported Trump but there's few
[01:36:36.680 --> 01:36:41.680]  things I don't like that he's doing right now well let's name those because
[01:36:41.680 --> 01:36:46.680]  there's a lot Trump's doing I don't like oh yeah it's red flag laws I don't like
[01:36:46.680 --> 01:36:52.680]  it you know we like our guns and Tennessee as good as you do in Texas and
[01:36:52.680 --> 01:36:59.680]  you know I don't like that you know he's too much involved with Israel I'm a
[01:36:59.680 --> 01:37:04.680]  Jewish person that's converted to Christianity so I am not antithopedic
[01:37:04.680 --> 01:37:10.680]  yesterday I watched CPAC and the way that they they did nothing but talk about
[01:37:10.680 --> 01:37:15.680]  Israel now Trump didn't but everybody else did then they kicked out Laura
[01:37:15.680 --> 01:37:22.680]  Loomer which I thought was very ironic you know she no no no ma'am ma'am ma'am I
[01:37:22.680 --> 01:37:26.680]  totally agree with what you're saying because I'm nothing against Israel but
[01:37:26.680 --> 01:37:30.680]  I want to fix our country you know how does Israel have a big giant beautiful
[01:37:30.680 --> 01:37:35.680]  wall that works great and it's cut down like 99% the amount of suicide bombers
[01:37:35.680 --> 01:37:40.680]  and things and then a lot of the Israel lobby lobbies for us not to have a wall
[01:37:40.680 --> 01:37:45.680]  well and it can create me if I'm wrong you know but they're down there right now
[01:37:45.680 --> 01:37:49.680]  working on the wall I mean it's not a wall but it's going to be a good barrier
[01:37:49.680 --> 01:37:53.680]  sure I mean I mean Trump has fulfilled most of his promises and I like him on
[01:37:53.680 --> 01:37:57.680]  that front but where I have a problem with him is Whitaker who I thought did a
[01:37:57.680 --> 01:38:02.680]  great job was removed this weekend Whitaker out at Justice Department and
[01:38:02.680 --> 01:38:07.680]  we've got this individual that literally put people like Mueller in power
[01:38:07.680 --> 01:38:13.680]  coming in and putting in all these new people and so it looks like Trump's just
[01:38:13.680 --> 01:38:17.680]  refilling the swamp right there it remains to see what they're going to do
[01:38:17.680 --> 01:38:23.680]  the proof will be in the pudding Trump again also is doing nothing about all the
[01:38:23.680 --> 01:38:28.680]  censorship of not just himself but of conservatives libertarians and a
[01:38:28.680 --> 01:38:33.680]  nationalist everywhere while the big tech lies to Congress I'm upset with
[01:38:33.680 --> 01:38:36.680]  Trump about that I mean I still think Trump's way better than Hillary but we
[01:38:36.680 --> 01:38:42.680]  can't sit here like cult members and not criticize Trump I'm saying the place to
[01:38:42.680 --> 01:38:47.680]  criticize Trump is not on trying to defend the border when it's under literal
[01:38:47.680 --> 01:38:52.680]  UN attack to overwhelm our judges and our courts and law enforcement to cause a
[01:38:52.680 --> 01:38:56.680]  collapse level event when foreign governments are working to collapse
[01:38:56.680 --> 01:39:01.680]  borders and the Democratic Party is saying no borders no walls no USA at all
[01:39:01.680 --> 01:39:05.680]  and America was never great will never be great when we have a UN quarterback
[01:39:05.680 --> 01:39:10.680]  Soros directed plan to break our borders you better believe the president has the
[01:39:10.680 --> 01:39:14.680]  right to militarize the border and to shut the damn thing down and all I'm
[01:39:14.680 --> 01:39:19.680]  saying is of all the things Rand Paul could be after Trump on why is he not
[01:39:19.680 --> 01:39:23.680]  after him on this one why is he not supporting him I think that he is
[01:39:23.680 --> 01:39:29.680]  supporting him but he's given his opinion that that's still hearing her there
[01:39:29.680 --> 01:39:34.680]  as far as if he's supporting him they're building the wall I think they're going
[01:39:34.680 --> 01:39:38.680]  to they have been militarizing the law I don't care what they do I don't care if
[01:39:38.680 --> 01:39:42.680]  they start shooting down there but I hear your points I gotta jump but you
[01:39:42.680 --> 01:39:48.680]  made some great points here look Trump rode in on a nationalist populist wave
[01:39:48.680 --> 01:39:52.680]  and if he wants to bring in a bunch of neocons and a bunch of establishment
[01:39:52.680 --> 01:39:55.680]  people who want to be friends with the mainstream media so they don't get
[01:39:55.680 --> 01:40:01.680]  attacked then that will be his undoing I haven't seen that so far but I've seen
[01:40:01.680 --> 01:40:06.680]  some signs of it and I don't like it all right let's take another phone call
[01:40:06.680 --> 01:40:13.680]  here let's talk to John in the Virgin Islands John you're on the air go ahead
[01:40:13.680 --> 01:40:18.680]  Alex are you doing then listen to you for years and these particular issues
[01:40:18.680 --> 01:40:24.680]  that we've got going on today seem to be as though there's a real vortex that
[01:40:24.680 --> 01:40:30.680]  tightening the vortex being created and you know we're talking about Venezuela
[01:40:30.680 --> 01:40:33.680]  we talked about the border we talked about everything you go over every day
[01:40:33.680 --> 01:40:38.680]  and it just leaving a tapestry that comes to the same kind of picture
[01:40:38.680 --> 01:40:43.680]  every time and it really is more question than it is a statement Alex and
[01:40:43.680 --> 01:40:50.680]  the question is is why is it myself yourself and everyone listening to my
[01:40:50.680 --> 01:40:57.680]  voice are constantly subjected to the negative forces that we pay to be
[01:40:57.680 --> 01:41:05.680]  protected from with our tax dollars and just our trust briefly on the border
[01:41:05.680 --> 01:41:11.680]  we talked about the potential powers that can be invoked in a national emergency
[01:41:11.680 --> 01:41:16.680]  you just mentioned with the previous caller that there are situations that
[01:41:16.680 --> 01:41:22.680]  are causing us to doubt President Trump in some critical areas I mean for
[01:41:22.680 --> 01:41:28.680]  example the declassification of the fries the documents and so on and so forth
[01:41:28.680 --> 01:41:34.680]  and we keep being moved from issue to issue without putting a bullseye on
[01:41:34.680 --> 01:41:39.680]  each one of them one at a time and I'm afraid Alex that the only people who
[01:41:39.680 --> 01:41:44.680]  are going to be able to fight our way out of this regardless of the best that
[01:41:44.680 --> 01:41:49.680]  President Trump can do is going to be the people of the United States that are
[01:41:49.680 --> 01:41:54.680]  armed with the help of God and that's my comment oh there's no doubt the
[01:41:54.680 --> 01:41:59.680]  globalist one our guns because they want to be able to force this on us and
[01:41:59.680 --> 01:42:01.680]  they want to be able to trigger an economic collapse and then have a
[01:42:01.680 --> 01:42:05.680]  starving to death but then they've done analysis and know that that would
[01:42:05.680 --> 01:42:08.680]  probably form groups that would take the local governments back and local
[01:42:08.680 --> 01:42:11.680]  governments would stand against that and actually distribute the food evenly
[01:42:11.680 --> 01:42:16.680]  socialist and communist and fascist regimes always use food as a weapon and
[01:42:16.680 --> 01:42:19.680]  so they know there's enough regional government enough armed people that
[01:42:19.680 --> 01:42:23.680]  that old classic authoritarian plan would fail so it is the first amendment
[01:42:23.680 --> 01:42:28.680]  the second amendment that duly hold up the republic in times of crisis and
[01:42:28.680 --> 01:42:31.680]  that's why there's an attack on the first that Trump is allowed he's given
[01:42:31.680 --> 01:42:36.680]  lip service that it's wrong that's not enough and now he's letting them tip
[01:42:36.680 --> 01:42:40.680]  toe towards the red flag laws where they'll just without a judge or jury take
[01:42:40.680 --> 01:42:45.680]  your guns and if Trump does that his goose is cooked it's it's that simple
[01:42:45.680 --> 01:42:49.680]  all right thank you so much great points john more calls only a few minutes away

[01:47:16.680 --> 01:47:24.680]  from the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones
[01:47:24.680 --> 01:47:30.680]  there must be some way out of here yeah I watched a lot of Trump's two-plus hour
[01:47:30.680 --> 01:47:35.680]  record CPAC speech and I then watched the behind-the-scenes things that happened
[01:47:35.680 --> 01:47:43.680]  and I can't get no leave. The Limp Rested Republican establishment that kind of
[01:47:43.680 --> 01:47:46.680]  sick of fanning it around they fought with everything they had to keep
[01:47:46.680 --> 01:47:51.680]  Donald John Trump out of office and they represent the Republican blue bloods
[01:47:51.680 --> 01:47:54.680]  that went along with the Clintons and giving black people triple the present
[01:47:54.680 --> 01:47:59.680]  sentences of whites and wanting open borders and cheap labor I mean everything
[01:47:59.680 --> 01:48:04.680]  we oppose they are and we've taken over their party with many members of
[01:48:04.680 --> 01:48:09.680]  Congress there are a lot of good members of Congress now like Nunez and Jordan
[01:48:09.680 --> 01:48:15.680]  and Gates and many many others and they're good caring smart informed hard
[01:48:15.680 --> 01:48:22.680]  working dynamic passionate truthful men not just their actions but their demeanor
[01:48:22.680 --> 01:48:27.680]  and how they behave you can say that's a good person and then you see them
[01:48:27.680 --> 01:48:34.680]  deliver but I watched Laura Loomer being treated like crap being lied to by the
[01:48:34.680 --> 01:48:38.680]  Republicans being thrown out for seeing Oliver Darcy who admittedly goes around
[01:48:38.680 --> 01:48:43.680]  trying to censor the internet and she was polite to him but she was dogged
[01:48:43.680 --> 01:48:46.680]  and stayed on him for a couple minutes and so they throw her out because
[01:48:46.680 --> 01:48:53.680]  right-wing watch run by the Southern Poverty Law Center complaint and you
[01:48:53.680 --> 01:48:59.680]  get around these Republicans folks that are establishment and let me tell you
[01:48:59.680 --> 01:49:04.680]  I know all the inside baseball from Fox News they tried to hire me for three
[01:49:04.680 --> 01:49:10.680]  different shows starting back 12 years ago 8 years ago 9 years ago they wrote
[01:49:10.680 --> 01:49:13.680]  article show Jones wants to have a job at news corps but we wouldn't give him
[01:49:13.680 --> 01:49:19.680]  one I would not even entertain it but it would offer me these shows they
[01:49:19.680 --> 01:49:23.680]  couldn't believe it but you don't want one I'm like no I don't want to fly
[01:49:23.680 --> 01:49:28.680]  every Friday afternoon to New York and then tape a show on Saturday that
[01:49:28.680 --> 01:49:41.680]  airs on Sunday no I don't want that well nobody turns this down well I do and
[01:49:41.680 --> 01:49:44.680]  there have been people like Matt Rudge you know it was it didn't turn down
[01:49:44.680 --> 01:49:50.680]  their Fox shows because they wouldn't let him show a devoted baby or a baby's
[01:49:50.680 --> 01:49:57.680]  hand reaching out grabbing a doctor's finger baby there I guess we're about
[01:49:57.680 --> 01:50:04.680]  to kill I forget that was like 20 years ago I'm gonna go back to your calls it's
[01:50:04.680 --> 01:50:14.680]  just frustrating that at Fox News I'd say 80% of the camera people and the
[01:50:14.680 --> 01:50:19.680]  producers and the lighting people and the people and people that do do all of
[01:50:19.680 --> 01:50:24.680]  it they are New York leftist and I don't even say New York City they're
[01:50:24.680 --> 01:50:27.680]  they're leftist that have gone to leftist colleges they've moved to New York
[01:50:27.680 --> 01:50:38.680]  and it's a cult and it's the same with the other channels and so you sit back
[01:50:38.680 --> 01:50:44.680]  and you see how they treat people at CPAC that's the loser Republican Party
[01:50:44.680 --> 01:50:49.680]  that we've basically taken over but because none of us are political
[01:50:49.680 --> 01:50:56.680]  people say oh Trump should just hire a bunch of people the average person
[01:50:56.680 --> 01:51:00.680]  nowadays is specialized they don't know how to run a multimedia operation even
[01:51:00.680 --> 01:51:04.680]  an average reporter has grown up being given all their talking points and has
[01:51:04.680 --> 01:51:08.680]  told how to dress and what to say and what to do they've created specialized
[01:51:08.680 --> 01:51:14.680]  classes of people in communications that are nothing but empty followers and so
[01:51:14.680 --> 01:51:23.680]  Trump is working with a bunch of zombies in DC and New York and LA these
[01:51:23.680 --> 01:51:29.680]  people are followers so I know why Trump's got his problems is that despite
[01:51:29.680 --> 01:51:32.680]  the fact he's a maverick and on a lot of incredible stuff and better Supreme
[01:51:32.680 --> 01:51:37.680]  Court justices and Hillary and patent establishment every time he gives into
[01:51:37.680 --> 01:51:43.680]  them and staffs his operation with neocons they repay it with backstabbing
[01:51:43.680 --> 01:51:48.680]  so I've noticed the paradigm and how this works you're completely loyal to
[01:51:48.680 --> 01:51:52.680]  Trump you don't exist you get upset with Trump and hold his feet to the fire
[01:51:52.680 --> 01:51:56.680]  you get results so people need to call the White House they need to call
[01:51:56.680 --> 01:52:02.680]  Congress they need to be involved and focused and say listen we put heat on
[01:52:02.680 --> 01:52:05.680]  you about the emergency you did it we put heat on you about this and that you
[01:52:05.680 --> 01:52:12.680]  did it good we want prosecutions of the Democrats we want you on the offense
[01:52:12.680 --> 01:52:19.680]  not on the defense with all the stuff they're pulling and we want a move
[01:52:19.680 --> 01:52:23.680]  against the racketeering the cartels the censorship that's going on because if
[01:52:23.680 --> 01:52:30.680]  you won't defend the first amendment we know you won't defend the second and I
[01:52:30.680 --> 01:52:33.680]  know Trump's thinking bump stocks aren't really used for anything I don't think
[01:52:33.680 --> 01:52:37.680]  they're effective their pieces of junk but he wanted to act like when it was a
[01:52:37.680 --> 01:52:42.680]  Vegas attack you know whoa we you know we got rid of something we he wanted to
[01:52:42.680 --> 01:52:46.680]  take that away from him and now they're just moving on to semi-auto and
[01:52:46.680 --> 01:52:52.680]  everything else and now he's talking about red flag laws where no judge no
[01:52:52.680 --> 01:52:55.680]  jury just somebody thinks you're dangerous with no proof your guns are
[01:52:55.680 --> 01:52:59.680]  taken if Trump endorses that he needs to get on the offense against it if he
[01:52:59.680 --> 01:53:04.680]  does that his base is gone and I don't want to see Trump do that so I say that
[01:53:04.680 --> 01:53:08.680]  out of compassion and caring about the country and about what Trump could
[01:53:08.680 --> 01:53:13.680]  continue to be to say danger mr. president don't go down this road let's go
[01:53:13.680 --> 01:53:19.680]  back to your calls John in Texas thanks for holding your own here welcome hello
[01:53:19.680 --> 01:53:23.680]  mr. Jones can you hear me I can thanks for calling my pleasure I want to talk
[01:53:23.680 --> 01:53:27.680]  about to all the all the listeners I want everyone to listen very closely we
[01:53:27.680 --> 01:53:32.680]  have to support Donald Trump no matter what we remember Donald Trump looks up
[01:53:32.680 --> 01:53:37.920]  to JFK will all of Jeff yeah I'm a huge JFK fan John F Kennedy and look what
[01:53:37.920 --> 01:53:43.180]  happened to him you said it yourself on foreign policy he got shot so Trump is
[01:53:43.180 --> 01:53:48.520]  not about to get shot if Trump gets shot where we at we got no progress so it's
[01:53:48.520 --> 01:53:52.680]  about being smart he's not an idealist he's actually a businessman and getting
[01:53:52.680 --> 01:53:56.680]  stuff done in real life you're saying he's a pragmatist and even John Stuart has
[01:53:56.680 --> 01:53:59.880]  to admit doing a great job getting 9-11 families are funding was already been
[01:53:59.880 --> 01:54:03.720]  funded doing a great job trying to end these wars doing a great job on criminal
[01:54:03.720 --> 01:54:08.080]  justice reform I mean he is steadfastly doing what you would do to make a
[01:54:08.080 --> 01:54:13.480]  country healthier absolutely and he said notice that right after he took away
[01:54:13.480 --> 01:54:17.920]  Syria from the neocon he gave them Venezuela so you see it's like making a
[01:54:17.920 --> 01:54:22.480]  deal so they don't often so they don't get rid of him and he wants them to think
[01:54:22.480 --> 01:54:27.040]  that they have control over him it's about it's kind of like he's a ninja
[01:54:27.040 --> 01:54:31.640]  while you're a really smart caller John I mean it's true regime change is evil
[01:54:31.640 --> 01:54:35.680]  and will fall apart in Syria unless it's done by the Syrians we don't want that
[01:54:35.680 --> 01:54:40.000]  but in Venezuela it could be doable and it's the right thing to do but can you
[01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:43.880]  trust the neocons but I get it it's a lesser of two evils well I think he's
[01:54:43.880 --> 01:54:48.000]  actually even smarter than that he's using their own nature against them
[01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:52.160]  because they're gonna create a migrant disaster they're gonna create a refugee
[01:54:52.160 --> 01:54:56.440]  disaster which is only gonna play into Trump's hand to put more optics on the
[01:54:56.440 --> 01:54:59.200]  need for a wall
[01:55:01.560 --> 01:55:05.600]  well if they don't fix Venezuela it's gonna cause the collapse either way it's
[01:55:05.600 --> 01:55:10.720]  I mean Latin America is collapsing it is disintegrating which you know I don't
[01:55:10.720 --> 01:55:13.960]  say that I like oh look how good we are they're collapsing no we've got problems
[01:55:13.960 --> 01:55:18.160]  too we do not want Latin America collapsing you know Latin America is
[01:55:18.160 --> 01:55:22.080]  gorgeous I've been all I've been all over it and the people are amazing and the
[01:55:22.080 --> 01:55:26.640]  food and the art and the resources are above ours I mean Latin America is a
[01:55:26.640 --> 01:55:32.000]  giant bread basket full of oil full of full of everything but it can't get
[01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:38.000]  itself together because it never got rid of colonial control absolutely so but
[01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:41.680]  right now Trump all Trump really cares about is America we need this border and
[01:55:41.680 --> 01:55:46.120]  so right now what you were saying earlier how the way Trump is getting the
[01:55:46.120 --> 01:55:50.520]  border he could have done it in a better way I think we need to be very vocal and
[01:55:50.520 --> 01:55:54.880]  maybe get a petition going that we want Trump to do it the way you said the way
[01:55:54.880 --> 01:55:59.640]  you were describing how he could get it done around that 76 law we need to let
[01:55:59.640 --> 01:56:03.800]  him know that we're behind him on that well that's right he needs to go
[01:56:03.800 --> 01:56:07.520]  commander-in-chief route because under that the border is under attack there's
[01:56:07.520 --> 01:56:12.600]  caravans coming you don't do it under a 76 law that you know just deals with
[01:56:12.600 --> 01:56:16.120]  funding and emergencies outside of Congress for other emergencies presidents
[01:56:16.120 --> 01:56:20.080]  have done which is constitutional I mean in many cases it's not in this case it
[01:56:20.080 --> 01:56:23.920]  is I've looked at it but as a commander-in-chief it's totally the right
[01:56:23.920 --> 01:56:27.160]  thing to do and it's constitutional I just don't know and I'm not the I'm not
[01:56:27.160 --> 01:56:31.480]  trying to put Rand Paul down but I'm sorry Rand Paul is doing nothing but
[01:56:31.480 --> 01:56:34.480]  getting a political victory with the left because he knows Trump's gonna veto
[01:56:34.480 --> 01:56:38.520]  this so it's nothing but optics and I just think it's a cheap trick yeah it's
[01:56:38.520 --> 01:56:41.920]  not the first time Rand Paul has betrayed us it's not the first time he
[01:56:41.920 --> 01:56:45.440]  seems to have some kind of compromising they seem he seems to be compromised but
[01:56:45.440 --> 01:56:50.200]  we as his true supporters as Trump's true supporters we've got to be very vocal
[01:56:50.200 --> 01:56:55.000]  and draw and let people know we want him to secure it in the way that you are
[01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:58.220]  describing so we need to do a petition get like a hundred thousand
[01:56:58.220 --> 01:57:04.720]  signatures or more we need to do something well Don Jr. last week like
[01:57:04.720 --> 01:57:08.320]  this was last Monday went on Tucker Carlson and said don't worry my dad's
[01:57:08.320 --> 01:57:12.160]  getting ready to do something we know the censorship's real it's happening we
[01:57:12.160 --> 01:57:14.960]  promise we're gonna take action they know that his constituents are getting
[01:57:14.960 --> 01:57:19.200]  really pissed and we're out here working to get the truth out and telling the
[01:57:19.200 --> 01:57:22.160]  truth and they're just letting you know media matters and all these other
[01:57:22.160 --> 01:57:26.960]  criminal organizations engaged in this activity it's just crazy we need action
[01:57:26.960 --> 01:57:32.400]  now we're only a year out from the main 2019 election being in the thick of it
[01:57:32.400 --> 01:57:37.640]  we need action now not later take action Trump will support you if you don't
[01:57:37.640 --> 01:57:42.720]  you're destroying yourself my god good call John all right stay with us more
[01:57:42.720 --> 01:57:50.320]  calls in two minutes the globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen
[01:57:50.320 --> 01:57:54.080]  and pump the environment full of the bad halogens fluoride chlorine bromide you
[01:57:54.080 --> 01:57:59.680]  name it that it lowers IQ it literally dumbs the population down and on our
[01:57:59.680 --> 01:58:03.800]  quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best idea in the world we've gone
[01:58:03.800 --> 01:58:08.920]  through two permutations first seaweed based iodine that was pretty good but
[01:58:08.920 --> 01:58:12.640]  hard to source and the globalist tried to block us getting a supply of it so we
[01:58:12.640 --> 01:58:17.240]  discovered deep earth crystals a pure nascent iodine and brought you x2 that's
[01:58:17.240 --> 01:58:21.080]  been incredible now due to the establishment trying to block that we
[01:58:21.080 --> 01:58:25.520]  did more research and secured more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine
[01:58:25.520 --> 01:58:30.240]  but chemist scientists and others showed us the research that by combining it
[01:58:30.240 --> 01:58:35.800]  with three other compounds two forms of iodine and vitamin C it super charges it
[01:58:35.800 --> 01:58:40.960]  and makes it even more bio available ladies and gentlemen you want to
[01:58:40.960 --> 01:58:45.600]  research it you want to see it it's an incredible discovery x3 now available at

[02:00:14.760 --> 02:00:22.040]  well mainstream news is announcing what we first broke five years ago and have
[02:00:22.040 --> 02:00:25.960]  been hammering since china's communist social score to go global that's
[02:00:25.960 --> 02:00:29.400]  already being used the last two years in venezuela the track everyone's
[02:00:29.400 --> 02:00:34.240]  political activities if they don't behave they can't buy or sell that's right
[02:00:34.240 --> 02:00:38.160]  they are artificially controlling the food and water to control the
[02:00:38.160 --> 02:00:43.160]  population the old chelchescu trick the old divide and conquer siege trick
[02:00:43.160 --> 02:00:47.480]  going right back to your phone calls and then coming up i mentioned it i didn't
[02:00:47.480 --> 02:00:53.520]  get to it i want to go to the tom delay exposing the secret democrat memo to
[02:00:53.520 --> 02:00:58.640]  promote pedophilia we're going to do that we're also gonna get into a host of
[02:00:58.640 --> 02:01:03.560]  other issues we're continuing with your phone calls paul watson was exhausted he
[02:01:03.560 --> 02:01:06.520]  called a few hours ago and said can i come on the show tomorrow because he had
[02:01:06.520 --> 02:01:09.800]  jet lag coming over here and then was at c-pack he'll be here for a few days in
[02:01:09.800 --> 02:01:13.520]  studio the next day and i said fine paul so he'll be here in a few hours they'll
[02:01:13.520 --> 02:01:16.640]  be on the war room and some other stuff coming up today but he'll be in studio
[02:01:16.640 --> 02:01:21.120]  this tomorrow but let's go ahead and go back to your calls who's been holding
[02:01:21.120 --> 02:01:32.440]  the longest here i guess that would be stew and then john stew in wisconsin
[02:01:32.440 --> 02:01:42.880]  you're on the air hi mr. jones i have a plan venezuela and then also product
[02:01:42.880 --> 02:01:47.840]  idea yes sir regarding venez i'm getting a little bit of an echo here of
[02:01:47.840 --> 02:01:52.120]  yourself i'm sorry we can try to work on that we're not i believe sitting in the
[02:01:52.120 --> 02:01:58.360]  audio back would you like to call back no it's okay okay in venezuela there i'm
[02:01:58.360 --> 02:02:07.800]  sure you remember that since you have a memory that chavez beforehand was
[02:02:07.800 --> 02:02:14.440]  attacked with pancreas pancreatic cancer and well i mean i mean i think people
[02:02:14.440 --> 02:02:18.120]  say that anybody famous okay i appreciate your call i just can't handle
[02:02:18.120 --> 02:02:22.080]  anymore i appreciate it but the audio is back and forth like you said and i don't
[02:02:22.080 --> 02:02:30.760]  think you can hear me i don't know what i could say to somebody that can't hear
[02:02:30.760 --> 02:02:33.760]  me and i agree we may have one of the worst phone systems the planets ever
[02:02:33.760 --> 02:02:38.000]  seen i mean i don't know i worked three other radio stations before i had phone
[02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:45.480]  systems and it may just be the nature of phones today but the calls don't sound
[02:02:45.480 --> 02:02:49.920]  good a lot of the time and the half of them can understand and when i call in
[02:02:49.920 --> 02:02:58.480]  i can't hear either i can't hear anything okay i understand so we'll see what we
[02:02:58.480 --> 02:03:02.920]  can do here we're gonna we're gonna try to stay on the air okay we're gonna work
[02:03:02.920 --> 02:03:09.840]  on that as best we can now i wanted to hear your point the audio didn't work so
[02:03:09.840 --> 02:03:15.040]  that interviews over here goes chavez was a globalist he had all sorts of imf
[02:03:15.040 --> 02:03:18.480]  world bank deals to sell their people out and sell their resources out so he
[02:03:18.480 --> 02:03:23.120]  made all these massive amounts of money offshore just like people like manual
[02:03:23.120 --> 02:03:26.880]  noriega did and Panama and who knows they've got ways to give people cancer
[02:03:26.880 --> 02:03:31.080]  sure viral and also the microwaves and with with with with different radio
[02:03:31.080 --> 02:03:35.800]  active isotopes so that could have been the case that could have been the case
[02:03:35.800 --> 02:03:43.800]  but i just don't know you know i'll start a radio show where we just take
[02:03:43.800 --> 02:03:49.200]  landline calls well good landlines were or you could hear everything everybody
[02:03:49.200 --> 02:03:54.080]  was saying you could you could hear a pin drop remember those so always ask the
[02:03:54.080 --> 02:04:01.200]  questions to rip off old joe rogan peace they had like 20 years ago in the
[02:04:01.200 --> 02:04:05.600]  future we were all forced to be flying around in jetpacks you know silver
[02:04:05.600 --> 02:04:13.640]  spacesuits but by the year 2000 your cell phone craps out behind a bush so i
[02:04:13.640 --> 02:04:16.560]  think that's really what it comes down to what we're going to see if it's our
[02:04:16.560 --> 02:04:21.680]  phone system or if it's you when we come back we're going to try again as hard
[02:04:21.680 --> 02:04:28.480]  as we can and we're gonna go to callers like john and marlene and chris and
[02:04:28.480 --> 02:04:33.560]  ken and robert and denis and steve and mike and jim and others from rhodo
[02:04:33.560 --> 02:04:37.120]  island of Wyoming from new jersey indiana from colorado the kansas from
[02:04:37.120 --> 02:04:44.320]  virginia illinois it's your phone call straight ahead in 60 seconds when we
[02:04:44.320 --> 02:04:48.240]  come back on the other side of this call but whatever you do don't spread
[02:04:48.240 --> 02:04:52.000]  news wars dot com just roll over to soros and mainstream media and just don't
[02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:58.720]  take action well i've got some really good news for all the viewers and all
[02:04:58.720 --> 02:05:01.640]  the listeners this was going to be a big loss because we couldn't get the deep
[02:05:01.640 --> 02:05:04.600]  earth crystals anymore for the year and a half fight but we have the original
[02:05:04.600 --> 02:05:10.280]  producer the original crystal source the best atomic iodine in the world x2 is
[02:05:10.280 --> 02:05:13.720]  back we got it this deal just happened about a month ago we rushed it into
[02:05:13.720 --> 02:05:17.720]  production it's been bottled the labels are being put on today and then it's
[02:05:17.720 --> 02:05:22.320]  going to be on an 18-wheeler right here to austin from the plant in the rockies
[02:05:22.320 --> 02:05:26.040]  and it's going to be shipped out to you be sure and sign up for auto ship then
[02:05:26.040 --> 02:05:30.960]  additional 10% off the 25% off celebration of the fact that we got it
[02:05:30.960 --> 02:05:35.200]  back and we're relaunching research the iodine conspiracy find out why it's so
[02:05:35.200 --> 02:05:39.200]  important find out what the globalists don't want you to have the good halogen
[02:05:39.200 --> 02:05:43.640]  what you have the bad halogens at infowarstore.com that's the umbrella site
[02:05:43.640 --> 02:05:48.600]  infowarstore.com makes you right with the supplements and this is the king daddy
[02:05:48.600 --> 02:05:56.440]  ladies and gentlemen it is x2 original now back at infowarstore.com
[02:05:56.440 --> 02:06:07.880]  you are listening to an info wars dot-com frontline report if you are
[02:06:07.880 --> 02:06:20.360]  receiving this transmission you are the resistance from deep in the heart of
[02:06:20.360 --> 02:06:29.280]  fema region 6 austin texas transmitting worldwide it's alex jones
[02:06:31.440 --> 02:06:38.120]  so is trumps national emergency constitutional do you support it should
[02:06:38.120 --> 02:06:42.840]  we back neocon lasin change in venezuela getting rid of something really bad
[02:06:42.840 --> 02:06:47.480]  but neocons have history putting something worse in what about the
[02:06:47.480 --> 02:06:52.200]  situation with north korea what about india and pakistan and the threat of
[02:06:52.200 --> 02:06:55.280]  nuclear war there these are the big geopolitical issues it's really a
[02:06:55.280 --> 02:06:58.560]  referendum i've noticed the call the callers about whether they support the
[02:06:58.560 --> 02:07:03.400]  president or not and then at the bottom of the hour i got reminded by one of the
[02:07:03.400 --> 02:07:08.920]  producers of this four years ago tom delay justice department wants to legalize
[02:07:08.920 --> 02:07:14.280]  12 provisions is what tom delay blew the whistle on former majority leader turns
[02:07:14.280 --> 02:07:17.880]  out he was right all these years later about the democrats willing to
[02:07:17.880 --> 02:07:24.040]  legitimize things like pedophilia so with the video that's coming up bottom of
[02:07:24.040 --> 02:07:27.320]  the hour a quick announcement because i never plugged new affiliates and these
[02:07:27.320 --> 02:07:39.600]  came in the last week or two kz in you 1450 a.m. and k a zz 1400 a.m. in utah

[02:08:41.600 --> 02:08:49.960]  band demonized broadcast in the world on these stations and many many others now
[02:08:49.960 --> 02:08:55.360]  continuing ladies and gentlemen with your phone calls i want to go to hold the
[02:08:55.360 --> 02:09:03.880]  longest now here let's go ahead and take a call from chris in indiana chris
[02:09:03.880 --> 02:09:12.240]  thanks for holding hey alex welcome hi yeah i wanted to weigh in on the
[02:09:12.240 --> 02:09:16.240]  constitutionality of the wall and everything but first i really got to
[02:09:16.240 --> 02:09:21.400]  tell you i saw brian stelter show yesterday and oliver darcy was on there
[02:09:21.400 --> 02:09:26.280]  they're both trash and see fact and saying it was nothing but people selling
[02:09:26.280 --> 02:09:32.560]  books trump steaks and believe it or not stelter said that dan bongina was
[02:09:32.560 --> 02:09:37.160]  there selling survival gear and stelter said that it's nothing but junk that
[02:09:37.160 --> 02:09:41.800]  people don't need and i think that just proves that he wants us all patriots
[02:09:41.800 --> 02:09:46.520]  dead and saying you know survival i mean brian stelter their sponsors are
[02:09:46.520 --> 02:09:51.760]  ridlin and prozac and all sorts of prescription drugs that kill you so i
[02:09:51.760 --> 02:09:56.320]  didn't follow that but yeah brian stelter is a monstrous creature yeah he's
[02:09:56.320 --> 02:10:00.560]  pretty much saying we don't need guns water filters hand crank radios flash
[02:10:00.560 --> 02:10:05.000]  lights jumper cables we don't need none of that only thing is they don't want
[02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:09.920]  conservatives and nationalists creating our own economy and getting people to
[02:10:09.920 --> 02:10:13.760]  fund us to build our own media system the big cardinal sin if you go back to
[02:10:13.760 --> 02:10:17.760]  the clinton documents that came out in the clinton library not the foundation
[02:10:17.760 --> 02:10:21.960]  the judicial watch suit and got about five years ago right when they get
[02:10:21.960 --> 02:10:30.120]  elected in 1994 they say our number one mission is stopping conservatives and
[02:10:30.120 --> 02:10:34.160]  christians having their own economy so we've got a ridicule any question that
[02:10:34.160 --> 02:10:42.360]  sells anything exactly now the constitutionality of what trump i think i
[02:10:42.360 --> 02:10:47.720]  want to tell president trump if you're listening right now you were people are
[02:10:47.720 --> 02:10:52.760]  not going to have any it's not they're not going to be able to call you a
[02:10:52.760 --> 02:10:56.680]  dictator if you go straight to the constitution it says article two section
[02:10:56.680 --> 02:11:00.600]  two it says it right there the state the president of the united states is both
[02:11:00.600 --> 02:11:05.320]  the commander-in-chief of both the army and the navy what's the point of an
[02:11:05.320 --> 02:11:09.080]  army and navy to protect the national sovereignty of the country and it goes on
[02:11:09.080 --> 02:11:14.160]  to say he'll defend the borders and stop insurrections yes and so there is no
[02:11:14.160 --> 02:11:18.760]  argument whether this is constitutional or not well he knows he's gonna lose in
[02:11:18.760 --> 02:11:23.160]  lower courts and then win in the supreme court it's all cut and dry i agree so why
[02:11:23.160 --> 02:11:27.060]  is ram paul saying he's against this because trump didn't do the commander-in-
[02:11:27.060 --> 02:11:32.680]  chief route he used a 76 law where you could argue either way my point is
[02:11:32.680 --> 02:11:37.960]  trump got us out of the tpp that was a true power grab by multinationals so
[02:11:37.960 --> 02:11:43.400]  how is he bad defending the border exactly and i think i agree with you
[02:11:43.400 --> 02:11:49.080]  totally that ram paul he's just doing it because he it's just just it's just for
[02:11:49.080 --> 02:11:53.360]  some like you said brownie points for the media and for whatever reason he would
[02:11:53.360 --> 02:11:58.760]  even care to have brownie points from the media i'll never know because he's
[02:11:58.760 --> 02:12:02.200]  someone that stood up for the constitution hundred percent i mean i
[02:12:02.200 --> 02:12:05.520]  don't i it really is a mystery to me alex well you know what happens ryan
[02:12:05.520 --> 02:12:10.920]  stelter goes into the bathroom and go you know the does his business and i
[02:12:10.920 --> 02:12:14.800]  guess ran paul like sneaks in and like ryan says you're welcome you can have it
[02:12:14.800 --> 02:12:21.400]  now and ran runs in exactly why would any of us want any any of the support of
[02:12:21.400 --> 02:12:24.440]  the corporate media i appreciate your call and look i don't dislike ran paul
[02:12:24.440 --> 02:12:30.040]  it's just the president defending the border when the u.s. funding giant groups
[02:12:30.040 --> 02:12:34.240]  it trying to crush it the democrats say to get rid of the sovereignty he better
[02:12:34.240 --> 02:12:39.840]  damn defend it i appreciate your call it's just it's ridiculous but rand's been
[02:12:39.840 --> 02:12:43.400]  a big trump supporter so maybe he's just doing this because he knows trumps can
[02:12:43.400 --> 02:12:47.120]  veto it anyways and this is how he gets brownie points and looks like he's quote
[02:12:47.120 --> 02:12:51.720]  balanced you can't be balanced with a bunch of out of control globalist all
[02:12:51.720 --> 02:12:56.520]  right next caller holding the longest would be john and wyoming then steven
[02:12:56.520 --> 02:13:01.080]  montana john you're on the air hello alex can you hear me yes sir you've been
[02:13:01.080 --> 02:13:04.880]  calling for years good to hear from you yeah i'm on the landline of course i
[02:13:04.880 --> 02:13:10.720]  don't trust cell phones you sound like a billion dollars yeah well one of the
[02:13:10.720 --> 02:13:14.640]  things that i wanted to point out his president trump doesn't need the
[02:13:14.640 --> 02:13:19.960]  emergency declaration because article four section four of the constitution
[02:13:19.960 --> 02:13:26.040]  reads the united states shall guarantee to every state in this union a republican
[02:13:26.040 --> 02:13:32.760]  form of government and shall protect each of them against invasion and on
[02:13:32.760 --> 02:13:37.560]  application of the legislature or of the executive when the legislature cannot
[02:13:37.560 --> 02:13:42.840]  be convened against domestic violence but right there in article four section
[02:13:42.840 --> 02:13:47.760]  four not only does it guarantee us a republican form of government but it
[02:13:47.760 --> 02:13:53.360]  protects each of those states against invasion so that's all president trump
[02:13:53.360 --> 02:13:58.520]  has to invoke he doesn't need an emergency declaration or anything of the
[02:13:58.520 --> 02:14:06.440]  sort now another thing i have known rand paul since he was a child because i
[02:14:06.440 --> 02:14:13.880]  supported his father ron paul when he first ran for the congress in 1972 and
[02:14:13.880 --> 02:14:19.640]  in 1972 he lost that race but he came back two years later in 74 and won his
[02:14:19.640 --> 02:14:26.360]  first congressional race and the problem with rand is the same problem that ron
[02:14:26.360 --> 02:14:30.960]  has there they're both good people but the problem is they're too libertarian
[02:14:30.960 --> 02:14:37.400]  and they are very weak on border immigration and border security both of
[02:14:37.400 --> 02:14:42.360]  them are very weak and another thing that you mentioned a while ago that was
[02:14:42.360 --> 02:14:49.480]  right on the money when you watch fox news no matter how conservative the talk
[02:14:49.480 --> 02:14:55.800]  show host is whether it's Tucker Carlson or let's say Lou Dobbs or Sean
[02:14:55.800 --> 02:15:02.160]  hands they put on no not only the guest but the crawler at the bottom of the
[02:15:02.160 --> 02:15:08.160]  screen is being typed out by a new world order leftist because the way that
[02:15:08.160 --> 02:15:12.400]  they word and the way because look i've worked in broadcasting going back to
[02:15:12.400 --> 02:15:20.480]  1969 so i'm not new at this thing but these idiots that they hire to type
[02:15:20.480 --> 02:15:25.760]  those news crawlers at the bottom of the screen are people who could easily
[02:15:25.760 --> 02:15:30.880]  work for cnn or msnbc oh listen i talked to the biggest talk show host on fox
[02:15:30.880 --> 02:15:35.200]  they say alex stay there i'll talk to you more john by the way i had a plan like
[02:15:35.200 --> 02:15:38.680]  five years ago to a show with john and a few of these other great callers we've
[02:15:38.680 --> 02:15:41.600]  never got around to it we're about to launch always say this never happens

[02:20:23.640 --> 02:20:29.840]  story up on news wars dot com that will be covering coming up the next segment
[02:20:29.840 --> 02:20:35.760]  and continuing with your phone calls news wars dot com Hillary Clinton receives
[02:20:35.760 --> 02:20:44.360]  unity award for having election quotes stolen from her that's right so that's
[02:20:44.360 --> 02:20:49.280]  the whole false reality going on we'll have that video for you coming up next
[02:20:49.280 --> 02:20:54.040]  segment along with several others back when the republicans warned that they
[02:20:54.040 --> 02:20:57.280]  got a secret member from the justice department about a plan to legalize
[02:20:57.280 --> 02:21:03.080]  12 perversions including pedophilia so that's the next segment but john in
[02:21:03.080 --> 02:21:07.680]  Wyoming has been calling for I don't know 15 20 years I don't know it's a
[02:21:07.680 --> 02:21:11.440]  great guy you know who he is this stuff the public and party witness a lot of
[02:21:11.440 --> 02:21:15.200]  stuff back in the Reagan days what would you call this point right because I
[02:21:15.200 --> 02:21:19.480]  want to support Trump and I know he's overall a good guy and they want him
[02:21:19.480 --> 02:21:22.400]  out because he's trying to be president and trying to actually do things for the
[02:21:22.400 --> 02:21:26.720]  position pragmatically for the nation but a lot of the things I see him not
[02:21:26.720 --> 02:21:31.200]  standing up against censorship or letting the swamp come back in with this new
[02:21:31.200 --> 02:21:34.840]  attorney general and getting rid of whittaker it it it makes me really have
[02:21:34.840 --> 02:21:39.520]  a concern what do you think well I agree with you alex because I think the
[02:21:39.520 --> 02:21:43.880]  problem is as long as he has Jared Kushner up there in the White House
[02:21:43.880 --> 02:21:49.640]  he's going to continue to have this swamp resistance at every turn that he
[02:21:49.640 --> 02:21:54.520]  makes he's got some people in there look at John Bolton John Bolton has been a
[02:21:54.520 --> 02:22:00.760]  longtime CFR member and of course you play that clip of Tom Brokaw not only
[02:22:00.760 --> 02:22:06.080]  is Tom Brokaw a decades-long member of the CFR he's also on their board of
[02:22:06.080 --> 02:22:11.720]  directors and when his good friend Joe Foss died the general Joe Foss who was
[02:22:11.720 --> 02:22:16.360]  an outstanding gentleman I met him at an NRA convention he had been the
[02:22:16.360 --> 02:22:22.720]  president of the NRA for a few years and so when Joe Foss died Tom Brokaw
[02:22:22.720 --> 02:22:27.320]  deliberately in giving his eulogy deliberately omitted the fact that
[02:22:27.320 --> 02:22:33.280]  general Foss was an NRA member and former NRA president and so we've got
[02:22:33.280 --> 02:22:38.440]  people throughout the White House now who are not friends of the president
[02:22:38.440 --> 02:22:43.720]  they're doing everything they can to distract him they're doing everything
[02:22:43.720 --> 02:22:49.280]  they can to subvert his administration because I've called there and left
[02:22:49.280 --> 02:22:54.240]  messages for instance on this article four section for the Constitution but I
[02:22:54.240 --> 02:22:58.720]  I don't know who picks up the phone you get it at this number that I call which
[02:22:58.720 --> 02:23:03.160]  I cannot reveal over the air and I can give it to you off the air if you'd
[02:23:03.160 --> 02:23:08.320]  like but this number that I call you get a voicemail and you leave your message
[02:23:08.320 --> 02:23:13.880]  and I have left some good messages for him but apparently whoever's answering
[02:23:13.880 --> 02:23:17.440]  the phone isn't giving him those message no it's true Trump began answering the
[02:23:17.440 --> 02:23:21.400]  switchboard about two years ago then they tried to stop it but he would randomly
[02:23:21.400 --> 02:23:24.240]  sit there answer the phone he wants to hear what people have to say he knows
[02:23:24.240 --> 02:23:27.280]  they're trying to cut him off remember within the news their main mission was
[02:23:27.280 --> 02:23:33.000]  to stop him getting info wars news and drudge news and daily collar news and
[02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:37.080]  Breitbart news those that actually brought him to where he is I'm just glad he's
[02:23:37.080 --> 02:23:40.520]  still in there because I don't believe unless they're two evils but imagine
[02:23:40.520 --> 02:23:45.720]  John give me your smart guy give me your two minute take on what would have
[02:23:45.720 --> 02:23:49.520]  happened if Hillary would have gotten in if Hillary would have gotten in well
[02:23:49.520 --> 02:23:54.680]  first of all whenever they claim that there was Russian hacking she wanted to
[02:23:54.680 --> 02:24:00.120]  go to war with the Russians she wanted World War three with the Russians now
[02:24:00.120 --> 02:24:05.400]  what the Russians have they came out with something in early 1995 it was
[02:24:05.400 --> 02:24:10.560]  called the squall torpedo for their submarines available with both the
[02:24:10.560 --> 02:24:16.160]  conventional and the nuclear warhead and it has a top speed of 200 knots that's
[02:24:16.160 --> 02:24:22.600]  230 miles per hour there is no submarine or surface ship that can outrun a
[02:24:22.600 --> 02:24:28.200]  torpedo like that plus they're coming up with these hyper velocity missiles that
[02:24:28.200 --> 02:24:32.760]  are going to be extremely difficult to shoot down if they start let's be clear
[02:24:32.760 --> 02:24:36.400]  we've got them too but they're classified it doesn't matter you don't win a war
[02:24:36.400 --> 02:24:42.880]  like this right but what what Hillary would have done is gotten us into World
[02:24:42.880 --> 02:24:48.360]  War three with the Russians and she was the one by the way after she butchered
[02:24:48.360 --> 02:24:53.320]  Ambassador Stevens and his three colleagues at Benghazi and she butchered
[02:24:53.320 --> 02:24:57.800]  him why because he was complaining that her State Department was sending
[02:24:57.800 --> 02:25:02.440]  stinger missiles chemical weapons and automatic weapons through Benghazi to
[02:25:02.440 --> 02:25:06.360]  the ISIS elements in Syria who were trying to bring down all of that has
[02:25:06.360 --> 02:25:12.160]  now come out I agree with you though I can't manage an office of 90 people okay
[02:25:12.160 --> 02:25:14.920]  and they're great folks but I just can't do it I don't know how you're supposed
[02:25:14.920 --> 02:25:19.120]  to manage the president has to count the military millions under him but tens of
[02:25:19.120 --> 02:25:22.880]  thousands of active employees most of them are leftist they admit they're
[02:25:22.880 --> 02:25:27.640]  sabotaging everything so I'm not giving the president a free pass but the fact
[02:25:27.640 --> 02:25:33.320]  that he sent Donald Jr. on to not just Fox but a bunch of talk shows to say hey
[02:25:33.320 --> 02:25:36.600]  I know you're mad I know you're being censored we're gonna do something soon
[02:25:36.600 --> 02:25:40.640]  they're getting the feedback people are really pissed about having their first
[02:25:40.640 --> 02:25:45.280]  amendment walked all over and so I think you should take action with anti-trust
[02:25:45.280 --> 02:25:49.320]  he should take action by doing a televised address about it I mean what
[02:25:49.320 --> 02:25:54.320]  does he need to do about letting the the globalist and the mainline right-wing
[02:25:54.320 --> 02:25:58.840]  pundits who want to get TV money and make elections all about Fox News they
[02:25:58.840 --> 02:26:01.480]  think they're in competition with those of us that are on the internet and on
[02:26:01.480 --> 02:26:05.080]  talk radio no I'm not trying to make the money I don't take political money in a
[02:26:05.080 --> 02:26:10.760]  campaign you morons keep your damn money I want the country intact and it's so
[02:26:10.760 --> 02:26:13.840]  it's the Republicans are trying to cut the internet off because they think it
[02:26:13.840 --> 02:26:19.240]  will make it to focus and they'll get more RNC money this is insane now I told
[02:26:19.240 --> 02:26:23.040]  your screener a while ago when I spoke to him he's a very nice young man by the
[02:26:23.040 --> 02:26:27.120]  way and I told him there's some of the stuff that we're up to here and shared
[02:26:27.120 --> 02:26:32.160]  in that I can't discuss for now over the air but I can discuss it with you off
[02:26:32.160 --> 02:26:37.480]  the air but I've got to be leaving in about a half hour to 45 minutes and I've
[02:26:37.480 --> 02:26:41.280]  got some business to take care of and what we're doing is going to be for a
[02:26:41.280 --> 02:26:46.320]  small town of 18,000 people is going to be monumental it's very legal is very
[02:26:46.320 --> 02:26:51.360]  moral and it's it's the right thing to do for the people because you and I both
[02:26:51.360 --> 02:26:57.080]  know that we have to answer to Jesus someday we don't answer to the New

[02:34:42.560 --> 02:34:49.600]  table Hasselhoff he traveled to London 35 years ago he met a very nice lady in
[02:34:49.600 --> 02:34:55.600]  Sheffield and he created the Wastelhoff that's the legacy as we all know it you
[02:34:55.600 --> 02:35:03.720]  like my jacket Alex I do raw edge right that's right I'm here how's it going good
[02:35:03.720 --> 02:35:13.120]  so that's your your your RAF jacket on yep European style so you you've just
[02:35:13.120 --> 02:35:17.800]  been in DC for a while what happened there I'm a lot of drinking a lot of
[02:35:17.800 --> 02:35:21.280]  eating a lot of talking love strategizing it was fun
[02:35:21.280 --> 02:35:27.640]  Candace owns got her engagement party Don Jr. was there for ages there so but
[02:35:27.640 --> 02:35:34.440]  you can imagine is quite interesting quite interesting reason to these elite
[02:35:34.440 --> 02:35:39.120]  levels now you're just like Icarus like flapping a little little vampire bat up
[02:35:39.120 --> 02:35:44.440]  in the heavens Alex Trump wished George former my friend and Candace owns a
[02:35:44.440 --> 02:35:48.760]  happy wedding the only way they can top that is by getting a good wish message
[02:35:48.760 --> 02:35:54.640]  from you can you do that right now yes I wish them both a wonderful wedding even
[02:35:54.640 --> 02:35:58.360]  though that is a hate crime under the left's rules for a man and woman to be
[02:35:58.360 --> 02:36:03.280]  married in a holy matrimony that's seen as Satanism on the left so I encourage
[02:36:03.280 --> 02:36:08.800]  them to continue with their I guess you could call it heresy and third-gates
[02:36:08.800 --> 02:36:13.400]  it's that's very very exciting and you're gonna be on Candace's show right
[02:36:13.400 --> 02:36:19.440]  soon enough I guess I guess but but the big exciting thing is Trump did call and
[02:36:19.440 --> 02:36:23.320]  think and congratulate me when I got married about a year and a half ago so
[02:36:23.320 --> 02:36:27.400]  Trump is a really nice guy isn't he yeah well I didn't get to meet him
[02:36:27.400 --> 02:36:30.880]  personally but yeah he wished them well it was really good and we all had a good
[02:36:30.880 --> 02:36:35.200]  time well it's very very exciting about you and wishing you well
[02:36:35.200 --> 02:36:39.160]  Watson you're so funny well anyways it's fun to have you here in the next few
[02:36:39.160 --> 02:36:42.240]  days with us what are you gonna cover front and center when you're on the
[02:36:42.240 --> 02:36:47.240]  broadcast tomorrow the overarching narrative which is something that a
[02:36:47.240 --> 02:36:51.640]  French philosopher called Eric Zamore talked about recently which is the elite
[02:36:51.640 --> 02:36:57.280]  importing their servant class to be their servants and then satisfying the
[02:36:57.280 --> 02:37:01.360]  demands of the the kind of yellow vest revolutionary movement by introduced
[02:37:01.360 --> 02:37:06.880]  introducing this universal basic wage you've heard about this right whereby
[02:37:06.880 --> 02:37:12.240]  everyone gets you know 20,000 euros a year in European countries and once they
[02:37:12.240 --> 02:37:15.480]  get that they're shoved aside and they're told to shut up not be out on the
[02:37:15.480 --> 02:37:19.040]  street not be rioting so that is the pacification method that they're
[02:37:19.040 --> 02:37:23.680]  introducing now in many European countries to stop these people being on
[02:37:23.680 --> 02:37:27.760]  the streets saying fire to stuff because they brought in their slave class and
[02:37:27.760 --> 02:37:32.440]  now they don't need people to do those slave jobs and the native population of
[02:37:32.440 --> 02:37:36.280]  these European countries are not interested in doing those jobs so now
[02:37:36.280 --> 02:37:40.600]  they're basically being bought off and told to show up with this universal basic
[02:37:40.600 --> 02:37:44.120]  income and that's gonna happen across Europe whether it will work or not
[02:37:44.120 --> 02:37:48.320]  remains to be seen with one other key ingredient there they're they're having
[02:37:48.320 --> 02:37:51.840]  the ultra rich push this tax the rich and they have Warren Buffett and Bill Gates
[02:37:51.840 --> 02:37:55.680]  saying I basically pay no taxes they said about themselves because they write
[02:37:55.680 --> 02:37:59.200]  the laws where they pay no taxes they then pointed middle class and wealthy
[02:37:59.200 --> 02:38:02.640]  people and said they should pay more to destroy the middle class that's the
[02:38:02.640 --> 02:38:06.520]  upward stairway for the poor to become wealthy and so you're about to see the
[02:38:06.520 --> 02:38:11.920]  end of the middle class basically sacrificed for a one-time meal or a
[02:38:11.920 --> 02:38:16.840]  selling of their birthright to blue-collar folks exactly the point is
[02:38:16.840 --> 02:38:20.760]  that you know this yellow vest sentiment they do not want to do those jobs
[02:38:20.760 --> 02:38:25.200]  anymore you know part of the main reason why that was why that was stirred up in
[02:38:25.200 --> 02:38:29.280]  France was the farmers out in the rural areas people out in the suburban areas
[02:38:29.280 --> 02:38:34.240]  this wasn't a city-centric riot this was the forgotten people now you have
[02:38:34.240 --> 02:38:38.320]  them being replaced not even not just economically but culturally France has
[02:38:38.320 --> 02:38:42.720]  an 8% population you look at cities like Antwerp Belgium this is the most
[02:38:42.720 --> 02:38:50.040]  popular city in Belgium 52% from a migrant background the problem is 90% of
[02:38:50.040 --> 02:38:56.240]  those 52% vote for either left-wing or far left-wing parties so it's a numbers
[02:38:56.240 --> 02:39:00.080]  game once it gets to that level it's over and which is that's why we're
[02:39:00.080 --> 02:39:04.200]  supporting the whole Brexit movement in America you know to reach out to people
[02:39:04.200 --> 02:39:09.680]  and tell them that they don't have to be NPCs and forced to vote in a cult like
[02:39:09.680 --> 02:39:15.160]  way for a particular party simply because they're non-white all right Paul
[02:39:15.160 --> 02:39:18.800]  I'll talk to you about 15 minutes when my transmissions over Gerald Slunt they

[02:40:16.280 --> 02:40:21.800]  year first I did a big order of 50,000 bottles got it in almost a year ago
[02:40:21.800 --> 02:40:26.440]  thought not ordering again would make them you know get me a better deal not
[02:40:26.440 --> 02:40:29.800]  with the actual manufacturer but with the oil company and finally after I
[02:40:29.800 --> 02:40:34.400]  discontinued it they said okay we'll give you a more fair deal because literally
[02:40:34.400 --> 02:40:38.880]  I mean I was paying like 12 $13 a bottle and then by the time I sold it
[02:40:38.880 --> 02:40:43.200]  discounted at $19.95 we couldn't fund ourselves but I got a better deal it's
[02:40:43.200 --> 02:40:47.600]  not as good as I wanted but X2 is back at least for now pre-orders right now in

[02:40:57.360 --> 02:41:00.880]  you there are so many things in my brain what I originally wanted to talk
[02:41:00.880 --> 02:41:07.080]  about was Donald Trump and like you you know talking about your X2 and it's the
[02:41:07.080 --> 02:41:13.360]  art of the deal you know Donald Trump I mean he's the original chess master he's
[02:41:13.360 --> 02:41:18.080]  got more on his plate more in the backside that we will never see you
[02:41:18.080 --> 02:41:21.840]  might see more than we do yeah but everything that he's doing that we don't
[02:41:21.840 --> 02:41:26.320]  agree with well it's a little bit of give-and-take here and there he comes
[02:41:26.320 --> 02:41:30.320]  after our guns well there's gonna be a problem however you know like he said
[02:41:30.320 --> 02:41:33.960]  with the bump stocks they're pointless they're worthless they do no good but
[02:41:33.960 --> 02:41:39.400]  he's actually out there fighting to make America great he's doing what he can he's
[02:41:39.400 --> 02:41:43.960]  not perfect you know folks always say he's not a dictator dictators can hardly
[02:41:43.960 --> 02:41:50.480]  ever get anything done so the point is a person in power is not like God he's
[02:41:50.480 --> 02:41:54.320]  been far from a dictator since the day he started even when he was running his
[02:41:54.320 --> 02:42:00.680]  company he hired smart people to do jobs that he didn't know you know he's he's
[02:42:00.680 --> 02:42:04.960]  actually that's a big point they always say he's got a high turnover let me tell
[02:42:04.960 --> 02:42:08.520]  you I've had some great employees about some bad employees crew member when we
[02:42:08.520 --> 02:42:11.840]  started actually doing faster turnover about five years ago so we finally got
[02:42:11.840 --> 02:42:15.280]  good people in place and now our turnover is not fast or slow anymore it's
[02:42:15.280 --> 02:42:18.640]  it's just moderate but we've got really good crew now because we finally did
[02:42:18.640 --> 02:42:23.240]  major turnover and so that's where it's all at and you make the best decisions
[02:42:23.240 --> 02:42:28.280]  you can based on what's in front of you however Trump he sees like you do a
[02:42:28.280 --> 02:42:34.880]  360 degree deal he sees 360 and beyond he knows that he's I really I'll say this
[02:42:34.880 --> 02:42:37.520]  he takes a lot of our advice and that's why they try to block him getting our
[02:42:37.520 --> 02:42:41.520]  info and you know they hate the mighty Paul Watson hanging out with Dom
[02:42:41.520 --> 02:42:44.720]  Jr. it's almost like he's touched greatness we'll talk to him in a minute

[02:48:01.480 --> 02:48:08.680]  warned six seven years ago that was written about 2015 by Newsmax he warned
[02:48:08.680 --> 02:48:13.560]  that the judge department of Obama wanted to legitimize 12 perversions and
[02:48:13.560 --> 02:48:19.120]  after he said this Obama legalized bestiality on us military bases
[02:48:19.120 --> 02:48:27.120]  Satanism but amongst it was also sex with boys the Nambla provision well it
[02:48:27.120 --> 02:48:30.640]  turns out all of this is now officially been adopted by the Democratic Party so
[02:48:30.640 --> 02:48:33.960]  here's Tom delay is right to put in prison for warning of this the former
[02:48:33.960 --> 02:48:40.000]  majority leader here it is a secret memo coming out of the justice department
[02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:46.320]  that they're now going to go after 12 new perversions things like bestiality
[02:48:46.320 --> 02:48:53.400]  polygamy having sex with little boys and making that legal and and and not
[02:48:53.400 --> 02:48:58.520]  only that but they have a whole list of strategies to go after the churches the
[02:48:58.520 --> 02:49:04.440]  pastors and and any businesses that tries to assert their religious liberty
[02:49:04.440 --> 02:49:09.360]  this is coming and it's coming like a tidal wave all right so come on I just
[02:49:09.360 --> 02:49:13.360]  want to get this straight so you you are aware of a justice department memo
[02:49:13.360 --> 02:49:17.480]  where that says there will be an effort to to legitimize or legalize
[02:49:17.480 --> 02:49:23.560]  bestiality pedophilia and there's a per as you put it perversions that's
[02:49:23.560 --> 02:49:29.560]  correct that's correct they're coming down with 12 12 new perversions and the
[02:49:29.560 --> 02:49:35.680]  LGBT just isn't the big is only the beginning they're going to start
[02:49:35.680 --> 02:49:43.480]  expanding it to the other perversions and then five six years later they're
[02:49:43.480 --> 02:49:50.880]  taking people offline when a man is in college races with girls and wins and
[02:49:50.880 --> 02:49:54.880]  the girls say it's wrong they delete their Facebook and Twitter because girls
[02:49:54.880 --> 02:49:58.120]  don't want a guy in their locker room with them walking around with his
[02:49:58.120 --> 02:50:04.680]  slung this is the total abuse the mind control the evil and Tom delay was
[02:50:04.680 --> 02:50:08.680]  right about that speaking of Hillary this is up on news wars.com and info
[02:50:08.680 --> 02:50:13.680]  wars.com a Jamie White article Hillary Clinton receives unity award for having
[02:50:13.680 --> 02:50:19.680]  elections stolen from her that's right let's go ahead and play a clip of that
[02:50:19.680 --> 02:50:26.680]  you
[02:50:33.680 --> 02:50:38.000]  Jesse Jackson up there this is a literal killer that sent blacks and said the
[02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:42.800]  predators put him in prison and here are the ruling blacks the house slaves that
[02:50:42.800 --> 02:50:47.520]  keep blacks enslaved unbelievable so we've got that let's continue with your
[02:50:47.520 --> 02:50:52.320]  phone calls let's go ahead and talk to Dennis in Virginia thanks for holding
[02:50:52.320 --> 02:50:58.960]  dentistry on the air hey Alex hi hey on the border you know the president does
[02:50:58.960 --> 02:51:03.080]  have a duty to protect and previous administrations have felt to protect
[02:51:03.080 --> 02:51:08.680]  you know it's more Americans killed by illegals than dying that died in the
[02:51:08.680 --> 02:51:13.680]  trade center World Trade Towers that is you know every year if there was a group
[02:51:13.680 --> 02:51:17.280]  organized group that was coming across the borders to slaughter four to five
[02:51:17.280 --> 02:51:22.280]  thousand Americans one day would that be considered an emergency just because it
[02:51:22.280 --> 02:51:26.160]  spread out over a month or even a year for that matter does that make it less
[02:51:26.160 --> 02:51:29.960]  of an emergency I mean how high does the body count need to go before these
[02:51:29.960 --> 02:51:35.440]  imbeciles in DC recognize we have a problem at our border well that's right
[02:51:35.440 --> 02:51:39.600]  and and we've got hundreds of thousands dead in Mexico Latin America collapsing
[02:51:39.600 --> 02:51:44.040]  as you said over 4,000 dead a year according to FBI's own numbers killed
[02:51:44.040 --> 02:51:48.160]  by legal aliens and that's conservative and so it is a classic crisis show I
[02:51:48.160 --> 02:51:50.760]  don't know what Rand Paul and others are thinking saying the president can't
[02:51:50.760 --> 02:51:55.960]  declare this emergency yeah if it was their children if there was if it was
[02:51:55.960 --> 02:51:59.120]  their boys and girls being killed you know they live in a mansion and they
[02:51:59.120 --> 02:52:01.920]  live behind the walls so they're not worried about it because they're not
[02:52:01.920 --> 02:52:05.760]  mainstream America they don't have to deal with the loss of life that the rest
[02:52:05.760 --> 02:52:11.160]  of America does that's right God bless you great point thanks for holding let's
[02:52:11.160 --> 02:52:15.600]  go ahead and take another call who's been holding longest now Robert and
[02:52:15.600 --> 02:52:22.560]  Kansas you're on the air thanks hey Alex if you want one world satanic
[02:52:22.560 --> 02:52:25.600]  government right you got to get those perversions through that's one of the
[02:52:25.600 --> 02:52:31.560]  key steps you guys have covered a lot of topics I I want to say to the callers
[02:52:31.560 --> 02:52:35.760]  that keep referencing the Constitution I'm a constitutional lover myself but
[02:52:35.760 --> 02:52:41.600]  since 1871 the documents basically been buoyed we're a corporation if you
[02:52:41.600 --> 02:52:45.760]  notice you know your income tax you know your speech you know they want your
[02:52:45.760 --> 02:52:50.440]  guns your privacy no I agree and Trump can declare emergencies now to play
[02:52:50.440 --> 02:52:53.840]  their game because he's the executive and actually do the right thing you see
[02:52:53.840 --> 02:52:57.440]  I'm not for the emergencies they're constitutional of its commander in
[02:52:57.440 --> 02:53:00.680]  chief but regardless he can declare emergencies like they did but then do
[02:53:00.680 --> 02:53:04.960]  the right thing well but that's the Civil War was about that and a lot of
[02:53:04.960 --> 02:53:08.080]  people think that it was about you know all these other things it was really
[02:53:08.080 --> 02:53:12.280]  taken us from a sovereign constitutional nation into a corporation where you are
[02:53:12.280 --> 02:53:17.760]  now owned as a stock and so I just want people to realize that you know you
[02:53:17.760 --> 02:53:23.080]  can point to the Constitution but hey Paul Joseph Watson brought up UBI I
[02:53:23.080 --> 02:53:27.440]  wanted to say as a trained economist that I advocate for UBI here in the
[02:53:27.440 --> 02:53:31.520]  United States I think it will change things drastically for the better we
[02:53:31.520 --> 02:53:35.600]  could outlaw homelessness get rid of welfare and it is actually a fair
[02:53:35.600 --> 02:53:39.280]  system so if you bust your ass on a daily basis you're going to get a
[02:53:39.280 --> 02:53:42.800]  thousand dollar check a month also that's going to take your income that
[02:53:42.800 --> 02:53:47.560]  much higher but a lot of homeless was take the money buy drugs and still be
[02:53:47.560 --> 02:53:53.000]  homeless my economist professors have argued this with me over and over and
[02:53:53.000 --> 02:53:56.880]  eventually they say so you just want more Cheetos and Pepsi sold you know and
[02:53:56.880 --> 02:54:01.160]  so I understand the that the beer money argument Alex and the problem is is that
[02:54:01.160 --> 02:54:06.040]  you're right to and so it's kind of hard to go back and forth but you can it sure
[02:54:06.040 --> 02:54:10.560]  would change the level of consciousness in the United States if people were
[02:54:10.560 --> 02:54:16.360]  able to afford food and rent as opposed to struggling so much in the
[02:54:16.360 --> 02:54:21.680]  financial area I hear you I appreciate your call we got a jump here because I've
[02:54:21.680 --> 02:54:33.160]  got Marlene in New Jersey Marlene you're on the air go ahead I go ahead I'm sorry
[02:54:33.160 --> 02:54:38.200]  your phone is unintelligible Marlene call me back another time Mike in Illinois
[02:54:38.200 --> 02:54:45.200]  Mike her on the air hi Alex great show I agree with that other caller about the
[02:54:45.200 --> 02:54:51.800]  Constitution but the Constitution is a common law document in the federal law
[02:54:51.800 --> 02:54:59.320]  title 27 section 72 one nothing trumps common law pardon nothing trumps common
[02:54:59.320 --> 02:55:04.400]  law well but but if you're in contract then that trumps it so that's and that
[02:55:04.400 --> 02:55:10.840]  title the Sixth Amendment is the right to know the nature and cause of it of an
[02:55:10.840 --> 02:55:17.200]  issue and Roger Stone can use that to not to stay out of jail because they
[02:55:17.200 --> 02:55:21.760]  don't want you to know the nature and cause which is a maritime type you know
[02:55:21.760 --> 02:55:27.960]  contract where the there's a paper that anybody could Google online it's called
[02:55:27.960 --> 02:55:33.440]  the special secret maritime jurisdiction of the United States now you know we
[02:55:33.440 --> 02:55:37.400]  know that the charges against Roger Stone who's the injured party on it no
[02:55:37.400 --> 02:55:42.040]  no injured party so therefore it's a contract yeah he's not with the Russians
[02:55:42.040 --> 02:55:45.880]  he didn't hurt somebody he didn't mug him he didn't tell him they came he lied
[02:55:45.880 --> 02:55:50.320]  to Mueller and that's not true right and who's the injured party nobody so it's
[02:55:50.320 --> 02:55:54.720]  the same you know the maritime law is kind of the same as the the military
[02:55:54.720 --> 02:55:59.440]  code of justice you know here you have criminal penalties but it's only based
[02:55:59.440 --> 02:56:04.000]  on contract you know we're if you sign up for the military you got it you know
[02:56:04.000 --> 02:56:09.360]  have your your signature on the dotted line that says you know exactly we didn't

[03:00:38.000 --> 03:00:44.800]  hi there this is Gerald Sollentie thank you Alex Jones and all your staff are
[03:00:44.800 --> 03:00:51.920]  having me on it's real honor to be on info wars and hosting this hour so what's
[03:00:51.920 --> 03:00:56.960]  going on in the news well let's take a look at the markets first now the Dow's
[03:00:56.960 --> 03:01:04.920]  down a bit today and here's the headline from the cartoon news network CNN
[03:01:04.920 --> 03:01:14.760]  Dow plunges below 26,000 after Donald Trump bash is fed Dow and brought a US
[03:01:14.760 --> 03:01:21.680]  stock market gave up early gains Monday today as investors digested president
[03:01:21.680 --> 03:01:28.920]  Donald Trump's latest criticism of quote the gentleman who loves quantitative
[03:01:28.920 --> 03:01:35.160]  tightening and quote a direct reference to Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell
[03:01:35.160 --> 03:01:42.560]  now I'm mentioning this and calling it the cartoon news network why well because
[03:01:42.560 --> 03:01:51.000]  when did Trump make this statement oh Saturday on Saturday Trump said at the
[03:01:51.000 --> 03:01:55.800]  conservative political action committee conference quote we have a gentleman
[03:01:55.800 --> 03:02:01.360]  that loves quantitative tightening in the Fed we have a gentleman that likes a
[03:02:01.360 --> 03:02:06.800]  very strong dollar in the Fed so with all of those things we want a strong dollar
[03:02:06.800 --> 03:02:13.560]  but let's be reasonable with all of that we're doing great can you imagine if we
[03:02:13.560 --> 03:02:18.800]  left interest rates where they were if we didn't do quantitative tightening I
[03:02:18.800 --> 03:02:23.520]  want the dollar that's great for our country but not a dollar that's
[03:02:23.520 --> 03:02:29.560]  prohibitive for us to be doing business with other countries end quote okay so
[03:02:29.560 --> 03:02:35.120]  let's get this straight that was Saturday right US stock markets gave up
[03:02:35.120 --> 03:02:40.200]  early gains Monday as investors digested president Trump's latest criticism wait a
[03:02:40.200 --> 03:02:48.800]  minute it's not the latest criticism that criticism Saturday Sunday Monday they
[03:02:48.800 --> 03:02:56.200]  had plenty of time to digest it that's not was bringing the markets down the
[03:02:56.200 --> 03:03:00.860]  markets only relatively down compared to where it's gone up now I want to make
[03:03:00.860 --> 03:03:08.720]  this clear I'm no fan of negative in zero interest rate policy all this is
[03:03:08.720 --> 03:03:15.560]  done is enriched the very rich and people have no place to put their money
[03:03:15.560 --> 03:03:19.600]  other than putting any equity markets because at one time these to put it in
[03:03:19.600 --> 03:03:27.320]  banks and get interest rates they used to have savings accounts those days are
[03:03:27.320 --> 03:03:33.080]  gone so I'm not defending Trump I'm just saying what a cheap shot they took at
[03:03:33.080 --> 03:03:40.680]  Trump when the markets going down today had absolutely nothing to do with what
[03:03:40.680 --> 03:03:49.720]  Trump said on Saturday and to even make it worse and why it's appropriately
[03:03:49.720 --> 03:03:59.720]  called a cartoon news network if markets went down because Trump wants lower
[03:03:59.720 --> 03:04:05.520]  interest rates they should have gone up because the markets love cheap money
[03:04:05.520 --> 03:04:13.800]  that's right they love cheap money so that just shows you the propaganda that's
[03:04:13.800 --> 03:04:20.040]  going on one thing has nothing to do with the other because if Trump wanted
[03:04:20.040 --> 03:04:24.920]  more quantitative easing and lower interest rates then the markets would go
[03:04:24.920 --> 03:04:32.440]  up not down this has nothing to do with it it's only kind of like a natural
[03:04:32.440 --> 03:04:39.120]  correction we're back in a little bit stay tuned for more information on where
[03:04:39.120 --> 03:04:48.360]  we're heading defending the Republic from enemies born and domestic it's Alex
[03:04:48.360 --> 03:04:50.840]  Jones
[03:04:53.400 --> 03:04:59.520]  I've been doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube censorship and I've
[03:04:59.520 --> 03:05:04.600]  noticed that there's one type of video that is the most censored the most
[03:05:04.600 --> 03:05:11.960]  varied the most suppressed and that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election
[03:05:11.960 --> 03:05:16.280]  night all the arrogant leftist authoritarians like the young turds and
[03:05:16.280 --> 03:05:21.800]  others get so butt hurt when Trump won they don't want us to have that victory
[03:05:21.800 --> 03:05:26.960]  they don't want us to remember what political action did and that's why the
[03:05:26.960 --> 03:05:31.400]  globalist Hillary and others are trying to shut in force down this is a fight
[03:05:31.400 --> 03:05:36.440]  about taking your speech away not just my speech about taking your very sovereignty
[03:05:36.440 --> 03:05:41.240]  away this country is in a war so again I want to thank you for what you've done
[03:05:41.240 --> 03:05:44.440]  but I want to remind you if you don't spread the articles and videos and if
[03:05:44.440 --> 03:05:47.840]  you don't financially get the great products we have and fund us and the
[03:05:47.840 --> 03:05:52.040]  360 wind we're dead in the water I'm in your hands you're in my hands info
[03:05:52.040 --> 03:06:09.200]  war store com thank you waging war on corruption it's Gerald Solente you're
[03:06:09.200 --> 03:06:17.160]  listening to the Alex Jones show it's getting it's on wow great being on boy
[03:06:17.160 --> 03:06:22.360]  to wage the wage your war against corruption it's like a full-time job
[03:06:22.360 --> 03:06:26.440]  and it's everywhere it's not only in the United States it's global name the
[03:06:26.440 --> 03:06:32.040]  country name the leader name the freak show how about that cut zone macaron
[03:06:32.040 --> 03:06:37.520]  over there in France huh yeah you see that latest you know it's terrible what
[03:06:37.520 --> 03:06:41.080]  they're doing over there in Venezuela right but hey let's not talk about what
[03:06:41.080 --> 03:06:45.480]  the police are doing to the people in that are protesting the yellow vests in
[03:06:45.480 --> 03:06:51.920]  France you see those tough cops pepper spraying the guy in the wheelchair yeah
[03:06:51.920 --> 03:06:58.480]  anyway staying on with the economy a little bit we had changed our forecast
[03:06:58.480 --> 03:07:03.800]  for an economic 9-11 for the very reason that Trump is saying that the Federal
[03:07:03.800 --> 03:07:07.080]  Reserve is going to aggressively raise interest rates this year and they
[03:07:07.080 --> 03:07:13.920]  backtracked on January 4th and again on January 30th they're gonna keep pumping
[03:07:13.920 --> 03:07:19.920]  more cheap money into the system in this article I was mentioning to you from
[03:07:19.920 --> 03:07:29.440]  the cartoon news network CNN they said that led by Powell central bankers or
[03:07:29.440 --> 03:07:35.120]  banksters to be more appropriate raised the federal funds rate a total of four
[03:07:35.120 --> 03:07:42.200]  times last year they have since backed off on the hawkish stance now that it is
[03:07:42.200 --> 03:07:48.640]  abundantly clear that stocks and economy you ready for this have become
[03:07:48.640 --> 03:07:58.760]  addicted to cheap money no kidding really blow me away hey when we were
[03:07:58.760 --> 03:08:04.760]  saying that all this was was monetary methadone that the Fed was shooting into
[03:08:04.760 --> 03:08:12.560]  the system going back to 2009 you blackball guys like me you said it was
[03:08:12.560 --> 03:08:21.160]  appropriate policy to bring in all that cheap money that has only inflated the
[03:08:21.160 --> 03:08:28.720]  incomes of the very rich so again am I for or against lower interest rates at
[03:08:28.720 --> 03:08:34.480]  this time bring them down keep the party going because if you raise them we're
[03:08:34.480 --> 03:08:40.040]  gonna go into a steep recession and that's why we did a 180 on our economic
[03:08:40.040 --> 03:08:49.760]  9-11 our forecast the 2019 is the Trump bump that's right the markets will go
[03:08:49.760 --> 03:08:55.760]  up not sharply they'll go down a little bit absent a wild card a wild card is
[03:08:55.760 --> 03:08:59.880]  like a war on the Middle East or what they're ramping up there to go in
[03:08:59.880 --> 03:09:05.040]  Venezuela you think you got a refugee in a migrant crisis now that's right
[03:09:05.040 --> 03:09:11.040]  Bolton bombs away over and you know Bolton John Bolton our national security
[03:09:11.040 --> 03:09:15.720]  advisor not my national security advisor this guy couldn't advise me of
[03:09:15.720 --> 03:09:22.280]  anything yeah they're talking now about that stupid banal line they keep
[03:09:22.280 --> 03:09:27.360]  throwing out there all cards are on the table you know stop with the baloney you
[03:09:27.360 --> 03:09:32.920]  know on the table so anyway if they launch war against Venezuela that's a
[03:09:32.920 --> 03:09:36.880]  wild card you're going to see a human wave of migrants and refugees heading
[03:09:36.880 --> 03:09:42.960]  north to the border like we've never seen before we need peace down there or
[03:09:42.960 --> 03:09:47.880]  else is going to be out of line so staying on where the economy is going
[03:09:47.880 --> 03:09:52.760]  and what's going on putting all the pieces together absent a wild card or
[03:09:52.760 --> 03:09:57.720]  war with Iran and it got very close over there last week with India and
[03:09:57.720 --> 03:10:05.200]  Pakistan going at it bombs away on both sides to nuke powers that's right so
[03:10:05.200 --> 03:10:08.800]  absent a wild card we're going to see the economy growing continuing the way
[03:10:08.800 --> 03:10:17.480]  it is now no great growth like last year in 2018 but moderate growth now what
[03:10:17.480 --> 03:10:23.800]  else is going on well inflation isn't going up and we know why and we're the
[03:10:23.800 --> 03:10:30.240]  only ones speaking about it we call it Gerald Salenty's 5-0 formula open markets
[03:10:30.240 --> 03:10:36.040]  why is inflation happening open markets you keep flooding product in at low
[03:10:36.040 --> 03:10:43.560]  prices no inflation over production you got more production out in the world
[03:10:43.560 --> 03:10:54.240]  than people could consume that's right and over capacity online brought down
[03:10:54.240 --> 03:11:06.840]  prices open markets online over capacity over population you get more cheap
[03:11:06.840 --> 03:11:14.880]  labor than you could ever ever dream of that's why prices aren't going up and
[03:11:14.880 --> 03:11:19.080]  that's why they can't see where it's going so that brings us to the next
[03:11:19.080 --> 03:11:26.600]  element gold and I love gold I don't give any financial advice but I've been
[03:11:26.600 --> 03:11:36.800]  buying gold since 1987 my first buy was at $187.50 an ounce but
[03:11:36.800 --> 03:11:47.600]  gold's not so strong why low inflation the higher inflation goes the higher the
[03:11:47.600 --> 03:11:58.080]  prices of gold go so right now we're in a gold stalemate I've been on infos well
[03:11:58.080 --> 03:12:06.200]  over a decade and my gold forecasts have been right on target and for the last
[03:12:06.200 --> 03:12:10.320]  six years I've been saying the same thing over and over and over and over and
[03:12:10.320 --> 03:12:15.920]  over and it's a hundred percent correct I keep saying that gold has to break
[03:12:15.920 --> 03:12:24.000]  over $1,450 an ounce to gain that strength back that it had 2010 and
[03:12:24.000 --> 03:12:31.560]  2011 hasn't happened the last time in the last few weeks several weeks we saw
[03:12:31.560 --> 03:12:39.160]  gold go around that 1350 mark I said that gotta hit that 1385 mark for it to
[03:12:39.160 --> 03:12:46.000]  keep moving forward to get to that 1450 an ounce mark didn't happen now we're
[03:12:46.000 --> 03:12:54.800]  seeing gold going below that 1300 mark so where's the bottom of gold gold could
[03:12:54.800 --> 03:13:04.960]  go down a bit you could go down probably as I've been saying again the years to
[03:13:04.960 --> 03:13:10.040]  around the $1,200 mark that's gonna be the stabilizing mark because that's what
[03:13:10.040 --> 03:13:16.600]  it cost to pull gold out of the ground whether it's down in Peru to South
[03:13:16.600 --> 03:13:24.800]  Africa you average it out that's the cost so that's the gold story silver silver
[03:13:24.800 --> 03:13:32.920]  follows gold but again we do not see a global slowdown even with the banksters
[03:13:32.920 --> 03:13:40.360]  pumping in more monetary methadone putting in more cheap money that still
[03:13:40.360 --> 03:13:47.680]  isn't going to boost gold according to our forecasts it has to be a wild card
[03:13:47.680 --> 03:13:55.520]  it has to be a black swan event it has to be something that no one expects that
[03:13:55.520 --> 03:14:04.160]  causes turmoil that shifts economies and equity markets sharply downward
[03:14:04.160 --> 03:14:10.160]  because gold is a safe haven asset and right now people aren't looking for a
[03:14:10.160 --> 03:14:16.880]  safe haven anything no need for guns gold in a getaway plan at this moment
[03:14:16.880 --> 03:14:24.840]  however and again I don't give financial advice it's very good I believe and only
[03:14:24.840 --> 03:14:29.520]  speaking for myself because by the way that is the motto of our magazine the
[03:14:29.520 --> 03:14:36.440]  trends journal think for yourself I say oh holding 10% of it in your assets if
[03:14:36.440 --> 03:14:45.240]  you could afford it is the way to go so on to the economy no shop downturn matter
[03:14:45.240 --> 03:14:59.440]  of fact in this same cartoon news network story they're saying that future traders
[03:14:59.440 --> 03:15:05.760]  now fully expect the Federal Reserve to remain on the sidelines throughout 2019
[03:15:05.760 --> 03:15:15.240]  according to Fed fund future prices we disagree if this economy slows down
[03:15:15.240 --> 03:15:25.520]  interest rates go down they raised them nine times in 2015 they could lower them
[03:15:25.520 --> 03:15:33.760]  nine times in no time if the economy slows down interest rates go down the
[03:15:33.760 --> 03:15:40.400]  economy boosts up just a little bit we're back in a few

[03:22:05.560 --> 03:22:11.160]  mind is you know I'm gonna move on a little bit we talked about the economy
[03:22:11.160 --> 03:22:17.480]  what's going on down there in Venezuela and all the folks that subscribe to the
[03:22:17.480 --> 03:22:23.120]  trends journal this is no surprise to them because the problems really hit the
[03:22:23.120 --> 03:22:28.800]  US media in the middle of January of this year but now in November trends
[03:22:28.800 --> 03:22:35.200]  journal we did a story called Triangle of Death and we had forecast that
[03:22:35.200 --> 03:22:39.800]  Columbia Argentina and Brazil were forming a triangle that was formed by
[03:22:39.800 --> 03:22:45.320]  the United States United States the brains behind it to overthrow the
[03:22:45.320 --> 03:22:54.640]  democratically elected government of Maduro now I say democratically elected
[03:22:54.640 --> 03:22:58.960]  because there's a number of facts that should be discussed that aren't making
[03:22:58.960 --> 03:23:07.200]  the prostitute news the mainstream media prostitutes those people that get paid
[03:23:07.200 --> 03:23:15.360]  to put out by their corporate John's and their Washington or Masters Venezuela
[03:23:15.360 --> 03:23:21.080]  last year had requested when they were held the election that the United
[03:23:21.080 --> 03:23:29.280]  Nations send in monitoring teams the United States vetoed it despite that a
[03:23:29.280 --> 03:23:34.560]  number of international groups went in listed some of them in the trends
[03:23:34.560 --> 03:23:48.040]  journal that monitored the elections yes the voter turnout was low about 46%
[03:23:48.040 --> 03:23:55.680]  but higher than a lot of other elections going on around the world like they just
[03:23:55.680 --> 03:24:00.200]  had over there and when the African country is only 32% of the people turned
[03:24:00.200 --> 03:24:06.560]  out but that didn't make the news so according to again it's not whether you
[03:24:06.560 --> 03:24:11.720]  like the guy Maduro they're in trouble is the guy a jerk you know none of my
[03:24:11.720 --> 03:24:16.920]  business because I launched occupied peace and I honor the founding fathers
[03:24:16.920 --> 03:24:21.640]  no foreign entanglements and just for the record every time we're bringing
[03:24:21.640 --> 03:24:26.720]  democracy to a country since the end of World War two it's ended in disaster so
[03:24:26.720 --> 03:24:32.160]  this one will too and it's also to me it has nothing to do with democracy it has
[03:24:32.160 --> 03:24:37.280]  to do with Venezuela sitting on the world's largest oil reserves and our
[03:24:37.280 --> 03:24:43.160]  secretary excuse me national security advisor John Bolton made the statement
[03:24:43.160 --> 03:24:47.840]  out loud the words are there that he wants American companies in there to pull
[03:24:47.840 --> 03:24:52.720]  out the oil so it's not about their broccoli crop or anything else maybe
[03:24:52.720 --> 03:25:00.240]  they got bananas who knows it's about oil so going back to what we're saying the
[03:25:00.240 --> 03:25:07.280]  hypocrisy in the coverage of this here's the front page story of today's Wall
[03:25:07.280 --> 03:25:14.680]  Street Journal you see that headline up there and all that big picture the
[03:25:14.680 --> 03:25:22.360]  spare grows on Venezuelan border as pressure on the door arises I mentioned
[03:25:22.360 --> 03:25:28.400]  is virtually no coverage of the police brutality being committed against the
[03:25:28.400 --> 03:25:36.520]  yellow vest protesters in France they're our ally how about what's going on in
[03:25:36.520 --> 03:25:44.480]  Algeria Algeria see the marketplace in old algae is send me photographs and
[03:25:44.480 --> 03:25:53.120]  souvenirs that's an old song Algeria they got a cat over there that's been running
[03:25:53.120 --> 03:26:00.560]  for five years five five elections five terms going for his fifth he hasn't
[03:26:00.560 --> 03:26:09.480]  spoken to the public you ready for this in seven years he can't talk they got
[03:26:09.480 --> 03:26:18.480]  him in a wheelchair strapped into it he's had a number of strokes the country's
[03:26:18.480 --> 03:26:25.800]  being run by a mafia the people are protesting the biggest protests they
[03:26:25.800 --> 03:26:32.080]  had since Algeria fought for its freedom against France when France was
[03:26:32.080 --> 03:26:38.280]  colonizing it back in the 1960s back in the 1960s it was still colonizing
[03:26:38.280 --> 03:26:47.680]  joints it never changes anyway that's not making the news it's not making the
[03:26:47.680 --> 03:26:55.640]  news what's going on Sudan or Congo barely a peep about what's going on in
[03:26:55.640 --> 03:27:04.080]  Mali hey did everybody forget about Yemen the slaughter going on it's only the
[03:27:04.080 --> 03:27:12.240]  worlds the worlds worst humanitarian crisis hey how come nobody's talking
[03:27:12.240 --> 03:27:23.280]  about bringing humanitarian aids into Yemen this is all propaganda most of the
[03:27:23.280 --> 03:27:30.360]  people don't know what's going on of all the Democratic contenders in the
[03:27:30.360 --> 03:27:39.080]  upcoming 2020 presidential reality show only one has stood up and spoken out
[03:27:39.080 --> 03:27:47.320]  against the United States involvement in Venezuela and that's Tulsi Gabbard a
[03:27:47.320 --> 03:28:00.280]  congresswoman from Hawaii and also an Iraq combat veteran the only one they
[03:28:00.280 --> 03:28:07.880]  all got locked up so most people don't know what's going on and it looks like
[03:28:07.880 --> 03:28:12.920]  again going back to what could destabilize the markets how about a nice
[03:28:12.920 --> 03:28:20.040]  bloody war that'll do the trick because again if you think we have and I'm all
[03:28:20.040 --> 03:28:26.160]  in favor of no illegal immigration if you think we have a problem now it will
[03:28:26.160 --> 03:28:36.240]  get a lot lot worse if there's bombs away over Venezuela stay tuned we'll be
[03:28:36.240 --> 03:28:39.480]  back in just a few

[03:33:59.520 --> 03:34:02.960]  at the current events swarming future trends and why the people so dumbed
[03:34:02.960 --> 03:34:07.160]  down as mentioning before about people don't know what's really going on in
[03:34:07.160 --> 03:34:14.240]  Venezuela or around the world look at that stupid cartoon episode of the
[03:34:14.240 --> 03:34:21.240]  Cohen Congress hearings what a bunch of stupid garbage who would waste their
[03:34:21.240 --> 03:34:28.960]  time and waste their life with that kind of information that won't help you in
[03:34:28.960 --> 03:34:35.360]  any way and that's what we try to do is look at the current events forming

[03:34:46.440 --> 03:34:55.160]  when I call the economic 9-11 on September 19th 2018 one day before the
[03:34:55.160 --> 03:35:04.160]  S&P 500 peaked for the year was 100% correct because after that the markets
[03:35:04.160 --> 03:35:09.400]  declined dramatically having the worst December at the Dow since the Great
[03:35:09.400 --> 03:35:17.800]  Depression but they did an about face the Federal Reserve did a U-turn rather
[03:35:17.800 --> 03:35:24.440]  than aggressively raising rates now they're going to be quote patient again
[03:35:24.440 --> 03:35:30.280]  we are the only ones out there I read you the Fred futures before or virtually
[03:35:30.280 --> 03:35:35.640]  among the only one set out there saying that if the global economy slows down
[03:35:35.640 --> 03:35:43.280]  and the US economy slows down they're going to lower interest rates Trump is
[03:35:43.280 --> 03:35:49.400]  in charge if you don't think he has any sway over the Fed share that's your
[03:35:49.400 --> 03:35:56.480]  opinion we look at it differently going back in hearing Paul Volcker was the
[03:35:56.480 --> 03:36:00.380]  Federal Reserve chairman under Ronald Reagan this is when he inflated they
[03:36:00.380 --> 03:36:06.240]  were raising interest rates like 18% you know way up there home mortgage 21%
[03:36:06.240 --> 03:36:15.880]  and Reagan called Volcker into the White House and this is from Volcker's
[03:36:15.880 --> 03:36:21.880]  mouth he was sat down in the library in James Baker which was the chief of
[03:36:21.880 --> 03:36:29.160]  staff for Reagan set the Volcker you have orders from the president not to
[03:36:29.160 --> 03:36:37.480]  raise interest rates before the election and they did we got the 2020
[03:36:37.480 --> 03:36:44.040]  presidential reality show shaping up and what a show it is it's the greatest
[03:36:44.040 --> 03:36:49.960]  freak show on earth ladies and gentlemen and children of all ages look at the
[03:36:49.960 --> 03:36:58.120]  Democratic clowns all stepping up we got Bernie Sanders we got the phony
[03:36:58.120 --> 03:37:07.280]  Elizabeth Warren one after another nothing and all they're talking about is
[03:37:07.280 --> 03:37:13.760]  tax in the rich which by the way I'm in favor of we got this little Cuomo over
[03:37:13.760 --> 03:37:19.160]  here the governor and a little boy born on third base and thought he had a
[03:37:19.160 --> 03:37:22.720]  home run with his arrogant attitude him and his brother Chrissy would be a
[03:37:22.720 --> 03:37:29.960]  nobody's if daddy was in Mario Cuomo the governor of New York yeah the
[03:37:29.960 --> 03:37:35.200]  privileged Prince over here playing governor he says if you tax the rich
[03:37:35.200 --> 03:37:42.560]  they'll leave hey cyanara see you later you go back to 1990 excuse me but back
[03:37:42.560 --> 03:37:48.200]  to post-World War two in the 1950s when the middle class in America was really
[03:37:48.200 --> 03:37:55.000]  building and booming this is on the Eisenhower hardly a socialist you know
[03:37:55.000 --> 03:38:05.760]  what the marginal rate hit at the height 94% tax for the very very rich today
[03:38:05.760 --> 03:38:12.320]  it's 37% it's higher in most other countries in Europe and all these tax
[03:38:12.320 --> 03:38:19.160]  breaks and all the tax deals they get and all the money that they wash offshore
[03:38:19.160 --> 03:38:27.080]  I say yeah let's tax them but that's not going to build the economy yes it'll
[03:38:27.080 --> 03:38:33.320]  bring more money in and yes it should be equalized because they monopolize
[03:38:33.320 --> 03:38:38.960]  things when I was a kid there were no hedge funds or private equity groups
[03:38:38.960 --> 03:38:47.000]  they're not creating anything other than wealth for themselves tax and I'm
[03:38:47.000 --> 03:38:55.960]  making things and I'm building things so that's what this election is going to
[03:38:55.960 --> 03:39:07.760]  be about not creating jobs not building the economy there's nothing positive
[03:39:07.760 --> 03:39:16.920]  coming out there as we see it again this is unprecedented in modern American
[03:39:16.920 --> 03:39:20.960]  history where we have so many people running for office so here's what I
[03:39:20.960 --> 03:39:34.760]  propose do away with the gangs the gangs that are murderers and thieves the
[03:39:34.760 --> 03:39:44.000]  political bloods and crypts the sociopaths and psychopaths that lead it
[03:39:44.000 --> 03:39:49.360]  liars into wars Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass destruction and ties to
[03:39:49.360 --> 03:39:56.600]  Al Qaeda and now we got Assad has to go Gaddafi has to go yeah one after
[03:39:56.600 --> 03:40:03.280]  another now we got Venezuela murderers and thieves they steal our dough in the
[03:40:03.280 --> 03:40:09.920]  names of too big to fail and to bail out their big buddies general motives yes
[03:40:09.920 --> 03:40:17.800]  sir and one after another the bigs get the bailouts and we get the chef you
[03:40:17.800 --> 03:40:20.920]  know when we talk about taxes how about all the people have to pay these
[03:40:20.920 --> 03:40:26.480]  moronic school taxes and property taxes the rich don't get hit with this this
[03:40:26.480 --> 03:40:34.560]  is a very unjust very unjust taxing system so my solution the salenti
[03:40:34.560 --> 03:40:42.080]  solution very simple do away with the gangs in virtually every state it's
[03:40:42.080 --> 03:40:48.600]  impossible for an independent to run for office and if they do they get barely
[03:40:48.600 --> 03:40:56.560]  any coverage do away with the political parties you're run on the merit so who
[03:40:56.560 --> 03:41:05.120]  you are not the fraudulent gang that you belong to I never Obama I hate Trump
[03:41:05.120 --> 03:41:14.920]  stop the freak show Republicans Democrats murderers and thieves no
[03:41:14.920 --> 03:41:24.240]  political parties let we the people vote for whoever we want and hey this is
[03:41:24.240 --> 03:41:32.200]  good for the me too movement bring the debates back in the hands of the women
[03:41:32.200 --> 03:41:42.320]  that's right those are the ones that used to run the debates before the
[03:41:42.320 --> 03:41:48.600]  networks took it over with the political party the League of Women Voters
[03:41:48.600 --> 03:41:57.360]  used to run the debates now we got the mafia the Democrats and Republicans
[03:41:57.360 --> 03:42:05.840]  putting up who they only want you to hear me too League of Women Voters let
[03:42:05.840 --> 03:42:12.720]  them run the debates stop the presidential reality show make it a fair
[03:42:12.720 --> 03:42:19.280]  run for anybody that wants to run we need a new system the old one is dead
[03:42:19.280 --> 03:42:29.280]  corrupt inefficient illegitimate murderers and thieves so no parties for
[03:42:29.280 --> 03:42:35.920]  the 2020 election only the person because it's only the morality of the

[03:49:13.920 --> 03:49:22.960]  healthy wealthy and wise so that's why I'm a supporter of info wars particularly
[03:49:22.960 --> 03:49:29.160]  in his time of censorship that's hitting so many of us and I meant mention the
[03:49:29.160 --> 03:49:34.360]  products to keep you healthy and we're talking before about the presidential
[03:49:34.360 --> 03:49:40.200]  reality show and the big issues climate change climate change here's my
[03:49:40.200 --> 03:49:50.360]  reaction to climate change if you dump trillions of tons of poison into the
[03:49:50.360 --> 03:49:57.400]  earth into the water and into the air you think it'll have a negative effect on
[03:49:57.400 --> 03:50:06.360]  you so rather than climate change how about change where they stop poisoning
[03:50:06.360 --> 03:50:13.760]  us with all the junk foods that they're pushing out into the marketplace that a
[03:50:13.760 --> 03:50:17.200]  chemically filled chemical the perfect name
[03:50:17.200 --> 03:50:24.880]  chemicals that's right hey how's that water over there in Flint folks
[03:50:24.880 --> 03:50:31.560]  remember Obama was gonna fix it folks yeah he folked you didn't he yep folks
[03:50:31.560 --> 03:50:37.920]  folks folks that's all he ever did and it's not only there's all around that's
[03:50:37.920 --> 03:50:44.560]  why you go to info wars and you buy those filters to get clean water to eat
[03:50:44.560 --> 03:50:53.760]  better foods this to me is where the politicians should be railing against
[03:50:53.760 --> 03:50:59.320]  because I mentioned about the gangs the Republicans and the Democrats all these
[03:50:59.320 --> 03:51:08.480]  little low-life people I shouldn't say all of them maybe 99.999 percent of the
[03:51:08.480 --> 03:51:14.840]  low-life politicians are nothing more than whores but a corporate whore
[03:51:14.840 --> 03:51:20.160]  masters who give pay them off to do what they want to put the regulations in
[03:51:20.160 --> 03:51:27.040]  that they want so they could sell their deadly products oh watch out for that 5g
[03:51:27.040 --> 03:51:33.120]  that's coming soon by the way we write about it in detail in our trends journal

[03:52:37.480 --> 03:52:43.360]  5g that these towers they're going to be putting up in neighborhoods the radio
[03:52:43.360 --> 03:52:52.400]  frequency radiation by a number of studies is truly deadly as are the
[03:52:52.400 --> 03:52:56.360]  information coming out with cell phones we write about all this and that's why
[03:52:56.360 --> 03:53:01.280]  I don't carry a cell phone I've been doing work I did work for the cellular
[03:53:01.280 --> 03:53:07.440]  telecommunications industry association back in the day when they had these big
[03:53:07.440 --> 03:53:14.840]  boxes in the trunks of cars with aerials so I've been following it since then so
[03:53:14.840 --> 03:53:17.520]  this is what you get in a trends journal and then you put all the pieces
[03:53:17.520 --> 03:53:23.520]  together again and this is why you should consider buying more of the products
[03:53:23.520 --> 03:53:32.800]  from info wars to keep you healthy wealthy and wise because again talk about

[03:54:34.320 --> 03:54:41.040]  vision 2020 special each week I mentioned this because this is how the
[03:54:41.040 --> 03:54:47.480]  prostitutes shove garbage down your throat big story here in the toilet a
[03:54:47.480 --> 03:54:53.560]  paper a record in New York slime I should say it to be proper the paper of
[03:54:53.560 --> 03:54:58.520]  record the New York Times yeah at a time's out of luck goodbye you keep
[03:54:58.520 --> 03:55:04.520]  selling us the war and just feeding us garbage look at this big picture here
[03:55:04.520 --> 03:55:11.360]  cannabis grower wants lifestyle experts touch Martha Stewart has taken on an
[03:55:11.360 --> 03:55:18.680]  advisory role with the Canadian company canopy growth to create and promote a
[03:55:18.680 --> 03:55:29.200]  new line of hemp based CBD products Martha Stewart doesn't come close to
[03:55:29.200 --> 03:55:35.000]  Bradford Beckerman no one does so anyway if you want to know more about cannabis
[03:55:35.000 --> 03:55:40.120]  and as Trends Journal subscribers know and I've done it on Alex Jones we were
[03:55:40.120 --> 03:55:47.080]  among the first to call reefer money madness that this would be a huge trend
[03:55:47.080 --> 03:55:53.040]  this is just the beginning it's going to be a global trillion-dollar business so
[03:55:53.040 --> 03:56:01.400]  moving on the story here that came out just recently a judge rules that a
[03:56:01.400 --> 03:56:11.280]  military draft of men is unconstitutional yep and the judge gray
[03:56:11.280 --> 03:56:18.320]  Miller federal district court in southern district of Texas took note the
[03:56:18.320 --> 03:56:24.480]  Supreme Court 1981 ruling that the expulsion of women from the draft was
[03:56:24.480 --> 03:56:31.800]  quote fully justified because women were then not allowed to serve in combat but
[03:56:31.800 --> 03:56:38.120]  the Pentagon abolished those restrictions in 2015 opening the way for
[03:56:38.120 --> 03:56:45.720]  women to serve in any military role for which they could qualify and they're
[03:56:45.720 --> 03:56:52.000]  talking about the draft guys have to sign up for the draft so I say me too
[03:56:52.000 --> 03:56:59.080]  you too and I say bring back the draft that's right you have kids forget about
[03:56:59.080 --> 03:57:03.840]  it you got to go serve your time everybody we've got to go serve your time
[03:57:03.840 --> 03:57:11.200]  you bring back the draft there won't be any war no more because no one will want
[03:57:11.200 --> 03:57:18.400]  to go so that's the way I see it you think for yourself this is Gerald
