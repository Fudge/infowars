[00:00.000 --> 00:17.120]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show and now
[00:17.120 --> 00:20.360]  your host, Owen Troyer.
[00:20.360 --> 00:25.400]  Alex Jones is going to be coming back in the next segment with all kinds of news to
[00:25.400 --> 00:30.400]  cover as well as an emergency message for President Donald Trump, but in the short segment
[00:30.400 --> 00:36.280]  and to start off the broadcast today, I want to contrast what's happening in America right
[00:36.280 --> 00:42.840]  now between proud American patriots and victims of Trump derangement syndrome.
[00:42.840 --> 00:48.760]  First let's go to what I found to be a very powerful video of an American man singing
[00:48.760 --> 00:50.120]  I'm Proud to be an American.
[00:50.120 --> 00:55.360]  This was caught on video at a Chick-fil-A. I found this to be very powerful and even
[00:55.360 --> 00:57.320]  brought me to tears last night.
[00:57.320 --> 01:00.920]  This is the state, this is the real state of America.
[01:00.920 --> 01:05.280]  Americans being proud, patriots being proud, and people having confidence in themselves
[01:05.280 --> 01:08.000]  and coming together and cheering on patriotism.
[01:08.000 --> 01:11.120]  Check out this video of a man singing I'm Proud to be an American at Chick-fil-A.
[01:11.120 --> 01:28.600]  That's pride in every American heart and it's time we stand and say that I'm proud to be
[01:28.600 --> 01:29.600]  an American.
[01:29.600 --> 01:34.720]  For the least I know I'm free and I won't forget the man who died and gave that right
[01:34.720 --> 01:44.720]  to me and I'm proud to stand up next to you and to thank her still today for there ain't
[01:44.720 --> 01:56.720]  no town I love of this land, God bless the U.S.A.
[01:56.720 --> 02:08.160]  Man, the entire crowd there at Chick-fil-A cheers him on as he does a beautiful rendition
[02:08.160 --> 02:10.220]  of I'm Proud to be an American.
[02:10.220 --> 02:12.840]  That is the state of America right now.
[02:12.840 --> 02:19.880]  That is the state of patriots, confidence, patriotism, just loving one another, all
[02:19.880 --> 02:23.000]  being a part of this great American revolution.
[02:23.000 --> 02:24.400]  That's where we're at right now.
[02:24.400 --> 02:28.000]  Let's take a look at where the other side is at right now.
[02:28.000 --> 02:33.120]  Let's take a look at Whoopi Goldberg going psycho after she claims to not have Trump
[02:33.120 --> 02:38.200]  derangement syndrome, she then breaks down and loses it and exhibits her Trump derangement
[02:38.200 --> 02:39.200]  syndrome.
[02:39.200 --> 02:40.960]  Listen, I don't have Trump derangement.
[02:40.960 --> 02:41.960]  Let me tell you what I have.
[02:41.960 --> 02:42.960]  Okay.
[02:42.960 --> 02:49.400]  I have a lot of, I'm tired of people starting a conversation with Mexicans, Elias and rapists.
[02:49.400 --> 02:55.120]  I'm tired of people starting a conversation about this country.
[02:55.120 --> 02:57.720]  Listen, I'm 62 years old.
[02:57.720 --> 03:01.920]  There have been a lot of people in office that I didn't agree with, but I have never,
[03:01.920 --> 03:04.840]  ever seen anything like this.
[03:04.840 --> 03:07.680]  I've never seen anybody whip up such hate.
[03:07.680 --> 03:16.040]  I've never seen anybody be so dismissive and clearly you don't watch the show.
[03:16.040 --> 03:18.720]  So you don't know that I don't suffer from that.
[03:18.720 --> 03:23.600]  What I suffer from is the inability to figure out how to fix this.
[03:23.600 --> 03:24.600]  That's my issue.
[03:24.600 --> 03:28.600]  But one of the things that you talk about a lot is your smiling and letting her embarrass
[03:28.600 --> 03:29.600]  herself.
[03:29.600 --> 03:30.600]  It's the deep state.
[03:30.600 --> 03:31.680]  How long has the deep state been there?
[03:31.680 --> 03:32.680]  And who's running it?
[03:32.680 --> 03:36.160]  Well, I want to answer your question because you gave me a help.
[03:36.160 --> 03:37.160]  I had to ask you a question.
[03:37.160 --> 03:42.160]  I had an opening statement, which was how horrible it is that Donald Trump is talking
[03:42.160 --> 03:43.160]  about all of these things.
[03:43.160 --> 03:44.160]  I'm sorry.
[03:44.160 --> 03:45.160]  I'm sorry.
[03:45.160 --> 03:46.160]  I'm sorry.
[03:46.160 --> 03:47.160]  No, no, no.
[03:47.160 --> 03:48.160]  You started with a fake statement.
[03:48.160 --> 03:51.320]  You shouldn't be here, end up murdering the children of American citizens.
[03:51.320 --> 03:52.320]  You know what's horrible?
[03:52.320 --> 03:57.960]  What's horrible is we need one sanctuary city to beat the hell out of people.
[03:57.960 --> 03:59.120]  That's you, whoopee.
[03:59.120 --> 04:01.240]  That's happening to Trump supporters.
[04:01.240 --> 04:03.800]  Thank you for coming to me and hear over.
[04:03.800 --> 04:06.760]  And so they cancel the segment, whoopee Goldberg whoops up her cards.
[04:06.760 --> 04:08.240]  She walks off the set in another segment.
[04:08.240 --> 04:09.960]  She ends up cursing Judge Genine out.
[04:09.960 --> 04:10.960]  There's a whole story.
[04:10.960 --> 04:12.080]  It's all on Infowars.com.
[04:12.080 --> 04:13.920]  But so this is the state of the left.
[04:13.920 --> 04:16.840]  They have a protest yesterday outside Maxine Waters office.
[04:16.840 --> 04:18.960]  They're burning the American flag.
[04:18.960 --> 04:22.160]  They're burning the American flag, ladies and gentlemen.
[04:22.160 --> 04:24.640]  So patriots are singing proud to be American.
[04:24.640 --> 04:26.840]  The left is burning the American flag.
[04:26.840 --> 04:29.720]  Whoopee Goldberg says that Trump is whooping up people to get violent.
[04:29.720 --> 04:31.240]  No, whoopee, that's you.
[04:31.240 --> 04:37.120]  A 17-year-old Trump supporter, Ashton Hess, was assaulted in Seattle yesterday by a non-binary
[04:37.120 --> 04:41.320]  with green hair, spit on his hat, ripped his hat off, spit on his hat, told him he's not
[04:41.320 --> 04:42.520]  welcome here.
[04:42.520 --> 04:43.680]  That's you, whoopee.
[04:43.680 --> 04:44.680]  That's Maxine Waters.
[04:44.680 --> 04:47.640]  So they're burning flags, they're assaulting people.
[04:47.640 --> 04:50.840]  Meanwhile, patriots are like, yeah, proud to be an American, baby.
[04:50.840 --> 04:51.840]  We're kicking ass here.
[04:51.840 --> 04:57.680]  So the left, full-on Trump derangement syndrome, the right, full-on patriotism, victory.
[04:57.680 --> 05:06.840]  Anyone who's studied history and knows how human systems work is horrified.
[05:06.840 --> 05:12.440]  We have global, hardcore anti-human psychopaths in control of the big corporations.
[05:12.440 --> 05:17.680]  They're trying to wreck free market and consolidate total control, dumb humanity down ahead of
[05:17.680 --> 05:19.760]  replacing us with machines.
[05:19.760 --> 05:23.080]  And Trump has come in and is resisting that and saying we have a human future.
[05:23.080 --> 05:27.440]  They are launching a civil war against nation states right now, collapsing our borders.
[05:27.440 --> 05:33.520]  And my only message is this, everybody better wake up and realize the fight is now.
[05:33.520 --> 05:37.240]  Everybody should be very, very urgent because the left and the globalists are frantic and
[05:37.240 --> 05:41.360]  launching their anti-human plan because they crave to control people.
[05:41.360 --> 05:45.480]  Those of us that are pro-human don't crave power, we already have the power, but we have
[05:45.480 --> 05:51.120]  to realize these scum are coming after us and we have to speak out and take action now.
[05:51.120 --> 05:53.720]  Info wars is on the front line and so are you.
[05:53.720 --> 05:54.720]  We are the resistance.
[05:54.720 --> 06:16.480]  The answer to 1984 is 1776, you're listening to the Alex Jones show and now your host,
[06:16.480 --> 06:18.480]  Owen Troyer.
[06:18.480 --> 06:23.360]  Trump derangement syndrome has reached new peaks, ladies and gentlemen, it has even hit
[06:23.360 --> 06:25.840]  the likes of Google.
[06:25.840 --> 06:29.120]  Alex Jones breaks it down.
[06:29.120 --> 06:31.040]  Google has done it again.
[06:31.040 --> 06:40.920]  Google is using its worldwide monopoly power of 93% of all searches to engage in fraud.
[06:40.920 --> 06:47.120]  Worldwide searches for the term idiot return the top results for Donald J. Trump, 45th
[06:47.120 --> 06:49.400]  president of the United States.
[06:49.400 --> 06:59.040]  Over just a month ago, ahead of primary elections in California, the top search term for Republican
[06:59.040 --> 07:05.760]  candidates was Nazi and Google officially at the top of their page under politics had
[07:05.760 --> 07:13.600]  a voter guide section that said the ideology of Republicans is Nazism and it goes on and
[07:13.600 --> 07:15.120]  on from there.
[07:15.120 --> 07:21.200]  Donald Trump is essentially shadow banned on Twitter right now as are almost all the
[07:21.200 --> 07:25.720]  conservatives or nationalists where you have to go directly to his page or be directly
[07:25.720 --> 07:28.760]  following him to get his alerts.
[07:28.760 --> 07:33.600]  Meanwhile, the left is calling for violence, attacking people on a daily basis for wearing
[07:33.600 --> 07:36.080]  make America great again hats.
[07:36.080 --> 07:38.520]  We're seeing all these calls to kill the president.
[07:38.520 --> 07:45.400]  This is a soft civil war taking place by multinational corporations and communist China that now
[07:45.400 --> 07:50.800]  owns Hollywood that is pumping out nothing but pure anti-American, anti-free market,
[07:50.800 --> 07:53.760]  anti-Trump, anti-infowars garbage.
[07:53.760 --> 08:01.840]  The president must move for antitrust hearings against Google, Facebook, Twitter and others.
[08:01.840 --> 08:07.520]  We as a people must not let the internet infrastructure we built be hijacked by world
[08:07.520 --> 08:11.080]  government backed up by communist China.
[08:11.080 --> 08:15.000]  Think about how arrogant they are to have the executives of Google, Facebook, Twitter
[08:15.000 --> 08:21.480]  and YouTube it's subsidiary in Congress on Tuesday claiming that they don't censor anybody
[08:21.480 --> 08:23.720]  unless they call for violence.
[08:23.720 --> 08:25.720]  It's total garbage.
[08:25.720 --> 08:30.800]  Myself Paul Watson, Ben Shapiro now starting to be censored you know at first he was all
[08:30.800 --> 08:34.520]  from me being censored but now he's freaking out.
[08:34.520 --> 08:38.840]  Ladies and gentlemen they're going after everybody they're making their move we're only a couple
[08:38.840 --> 08:43.480]  months out from the midterms this is a big campaign issue Trump needs to make it a big
[08:43.480 --> 08:49.120]  campaign issue instead of being flat footed because the Congress is sitting on its butt
[08:49.120 --> 08:54.440]  you watch these hearings the Republicans get circles run around them by these executives
[08:54.440 --> 08:58.000]  that are lying under oath and it's disgusting.
[08:58.000 --> 09:02.600]  We know what they're doing there's a big zero hedge article on infowars.com that lays
[09:02.600 --> 09:07.920]  it all out the tracker systems that can show you how your shadow man what's happening people
[09:07.920 --> 09:12.280]  need to get informed on this they need to get aggressive they need to take action.
[09:12.280 --> 09:16.640]  Google is a broken search engine it was a big scandal and they protected Hillary Clinton
[09:16.640 --> 09:21.320]  back during the campaign and would put nothing but positive search results up for and would
[09:21.320 --> 09:25.400]  bury stuff against her and CNN gave her the questions ahead of time but with all that
[09:25.400 --> 09:31.600]  rigging they still failed this time the amount of censorship and rigging is 50 times what
[09:31.600 --> 09:36.640]  it was I mean it's just it's a whole other universe and people need to take action because
[09:36.640 --> 09:41.640]  we've just gotten conditioned to accept this censorship as part of what they do no it's
[09:41.640 --> 09:47.200]  criminal it's racketeering it's discriminatory and it's out of control.
[09:47.200 --> 09:52.600]  We have Google set up by the CIA on record in QTEL a part of the infrastructure of this
[09:52.600 --> 09:56.920]  country handed over to private companies who've made hundreds of billions of dollars off the
[09:56.920 --> 10:03.360]  American taxpayer that helped pay for it and our infrastructure Google is NSA infrastructure
[10:03.360 --> 10:09.080]  and then now that deep state apparatus is being used in war against the people it couldn't
[10:09.080 --> 10:15.200]  get more obvious call your congressmen women call your state legislators take action and
[10:15.200 --> 10:19.800]  all of us are stakeholders with what Google's doing to us so if you're being discriminated
[10:19.800 --> 10:25.640]  against sue them now is the time to take action these arrogant technocrats think we're stupid
[10:25.640 --> 10:30.520]  we're not we're aware of what's going on and we're taking action got a special message
[10:30.520 --> 10:34.640]  coming up later in the broadcast where I directly ask the president to take action please stay
[10:34.640 --> 10:39.440]  tuned for that and spread it spread it by hand no one can stop you at point blank range
[10:39.440 --> 10:44.160]  telling everybody you know about info wars dot com and news wars dot com the forbidden
[10:44.160 --> 10:50.040]  verboten truth what the enemy and the tyrants and the globalist fear I'm Alex Jones again
[10:50.040 --> 10:53.960]  everything is up to you God bless you all.
[10:53.960 --> 11:02.840]  You know that's really incredible that Google would be so unmitigated in its total hatred
[11:02.840 --> 11:09.520]  for Trump that it would have idiots showing up in all the search results there's the story
[11:09.520 --> 11:18.480]  on zero hedge how the CIA made Google but think about it like this with 90% of the web traffic
[11:18.480 --> 11:26.480]  and web marketing going through Google, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube which is a subsidiary
[11:26.480 --> 11:35.240]  of Google if they are colluding or even if they're not intentionally colluding but they
[11:35.240 --> 11:40.840]  all are on the same wavelength it's kind of like if if if Alex says something and then
[11:40.840 --> 11:44.280]  I say something but we never talk to each other we just somehow said the same thing
[11:44.280 --> 11:49.440]  you're just you're you're you're on the same wavelength you're saying the same things you're
[11:49.440 --> 11:55.920]  channeling the same energy so if they're all censoring the same people if they all have
[11:55.920 --> 12:00.480]  the same sentiment towards Donald Trump well what do you think you're gonna get well you're
[12:00.480 --> 12:04.200]  gonna search idiot on Google and you're gonna get Donald Trump who's the farthest thing
[12:04.200 --> 12:09.120]  from an idiot in fact he's made everyone in the government look like an idiot if you
[12:09.120 --> 12:15.560]  want to be perfectly honest he's made them all look foolish where now in Germany you
[12:15.560 --> 12:25.840]  have another knife attack at least 15 14 people wounded on a knife rampage by an Iranian so
[12:25.840 --> 12:30.440]  you've got that going on you've got a this is incredible Mike Sernovich has been all
[12:30.440 --> 12:35.760]  over this for like the last 24 hours this Disney I can't remember if it's a director
[12:35.760 --> 12:44.000]  or a producer James Gunn and Sernovich has been all over this guy this is a most recent
[12:44.000 --> 12:48.000]  tweet James Gunn deleted over 10,000 tweets and even took down his personal blog after
[12:48.000 --> 12:51.320]  pedophile content was found on it the media is covering this up and I'm trying to make
[12:51.320 --> 12:55.360]  it blow blow over don't let them and trying to make it blow over don't let them yeah and
[12:55.360 --> 12:59.840]  he's not letting them and this isn't the first person affiliated with Disney to have this
[12:59.840 --> 13:06.760]  kind of crap found out you just had the the one guy from Harvard who was running the organization
[13:06.760 --> 13:11.160]  the foundation to help children he turns out being to be a pedophile you have the mayor
[13:11.160 --> 13:16.760]  of the Blasio's top staffer the next John Podesta of the Democrat party boom he goes
[13:16.760 --> 13:30.320]  down he's a pedophile what the hell is going on here you've got demon demon dressed transsexuals
[13:30.320 --> 13:37.400]  reading to your children at your local library what is this madness and I'm just getting
[13:37.400 --> 13:44.760]  totally off base but but if they are in control of 90% of web trafficking the people that
[13:44.760 --> 13:50.720]  do this kind of crap these are the people that endorse and are are are happy with that
[13:50.720 --> 13:59.240]  kind of crap these people are running the websites that get 90% of web traffic and and web marketing
[13:59.240 --> 14:07.560]  so so now that's like if you imagine the whole world having a veil over its head essentially
[14:07.560 --> 14:12.720]  and only 10% of the world can you go and actually be free and have a free exchange of ideas
[14:12.720 --> 14:21.240]  90% of the world is algorithmed and controlled and manipulated and masked and there's a 10%
[14:21.240 --> 14:24.680]  pocket out there that you can hope to get to that pocket is info wars that pocket is
[14:24.680 --> 14:31.120]  drugs that pocket is Breitbart that pocket is all the other smaller outlets out there
[14:31.120 --> 14:38.360]  that are putting out great news so it's all about control now here at info wars we're
[14:38.360 --> 14:43.640]  not under control we sell great products and you know I was thinking about this we always
[14:43.640 --> 14:46.960]  talk about how we need your help that's why we have these sales that's why we have in
[14:46.960 --> 14:52.680]  force.com store.com and it's true but it's almost not even fair to plug that way because
[14:52.680 --> 14:56.160]  the products are actually incredible so it's like we're not even talking about how great
[14:56.160 --> 15:00.320]  the products are instead we're like hey we're under attack they're suing us they're trying
[15:00.320 --> 15:05.120]  to shut us down all all networks saying you know we're conspiracy theorists holocaust
[15:05.120 --> 15:11.320]  deniers now that's the new one totally bull bull they never can play a clip but but it's
[15:11.320 --> 15:15.360]  like instead of instead of saying that oh help us you know we're under attack really
[15:15.360 --> 15:21.560]  it's it's we have incredible products at infowarstore.com where I even had let's say a cut or an
[15:21.560 --> 15:29.080]  abrasion on my index finger on my right hand and last night for the first time I used the

[24:19.040 --> 24:26.360]  know anything that's going on he comes back knowing no context of of what's going on politically

[24:45.160 --> 24:50.960]  to be so angry over a hat that you go out and you beat inanimate objects like at some
[24:50.960 --> 25:00.720]  kind of faux victory encouraging children to to engage in this behavior yes screw trump

[25:13.960 --> 25:18.520]  hellhole like we have in san francisco where the mayor goes out in the streets and says
[25:18.520 --> 25:22.840]  this is the most feces i've ever seen in my life that's what i want i want a bunch of
[25:22.840 --> 25:28.640]  green haired non-binary ninnies freak shows walking around assaulting people that's what
[25:28.640 --> 25:33.600]  i want i want a world of people that are so deranged that have no victory in their life
[25:33.600 --> 25:38.720]  have no success that they have to punch and kick and spit on inanimate objects just to
[25:38.720 --> 25:46.200]  get that feeling of victory just to have those hormones fire off in their brain just to get
[25:46.200 --> 25:51.920]  the endorphins out they do nothing they don't run they don't exercise they don't have friends
[25:51.920 --> 25:56.440]  they don't have lovers they don't they have nothing they don't like their families they
[25:56.440 --> 26:02.600]  don't have a gender they don't have an identity except hate and so the only way they can get
[26:02.600 --> 26:09.000]  the high off life is through hatred that's been programmed into them where you can only
[26:09.000 --> 26:16.840]  get that sensation of success and victory if you go out and you assault what you think
[26:16.840 --> 26:24.040]  is a nazi or you go kick a confederate statue on the ground that's trump derangement syndrome
[26:24.040 --> 26:30.520]  so ashen hess is going to be joining us the green haired non-binary can be quoted in fact
[26:30.520 --> 26:35.640]  do we have is that video censored guys let's go ahead and just roll it then let's let's
[26:35.640 --> 26:39.200]  listen to the clip this is from ashen hess who's going to be joining us later a green
[26:39.200 --> 26:48.200]  haired non-binary assaults him in the streets of seattle yes i know what it says don't take
[26:48.200 --> 26:59.240]  my hat that's my property dude come on that's really that's really necessary i didn't do
[26:59.240 --> 27:13.320]  anything to you real classy bud when they go low we go high
[27:16.440 --> 27:24.280]  disgusting and these are the same people encouraging this they're telling you
[27:24.280 --> 27:30.680]  you trump is disgraceful these are the same people like what whoopie goldberg saying
[27:30.680 --> 27:37.880]  judge janine is encouraging violence as whoopie goldberg's drug addict minions go out and
[27:37.880 --> 27:43.560]  assault people wearing trump hats go out and punch inanimate objects to get a sensation
[27:43.560 --> 27:51.840]  of victory like i mean you know you could you could you could go like join a gym and
[27:51.840 --> 27:58.400]  actually learn how to fight and then maybe actually get into a real scuffle at the gym
[27:58.400 --> 28:03.840]  i'm saying a real competition and then have success that that's real earned victory this
[28:03.840 --> 28:11.920]  is fake full victory see that's why they'll never ever feel accomplished this is why they
[28:11.920 --> 28:15.920]  cannot stop this is why this has been going on for two years because there's no real victory
[28:15.920 --> 28:23.440]  here there's no real closure it's just insanity and it is now referred to as trump derangement
[28:23.440 --> 28:28.480]  syndrome so i actually think that this is perfect timing for whoopie goldberg to say
[28:28.480 --> 28:32.320]  oh i don't have trump derangement syndrome and then exhibit the trump derangement syndrome
[28:32.960 --> 28:38.320]  that she has live on air freaking out and then cursing at judge janine who is just a classy
[28:38.320 --> 28:44.880]  lady the entire time and then you have a green haired non-binary assault a trump supporter
[28:44.880 --> 28:49.120]  17 year old trump supporter for wearing a mag hat spit on the hat say he's not welcome here
[28:49.120 --> 28:54.800]  so perfect timing for the left to really give a lot of momentum to that blue wave oh yeah you're
[28:54.800 --> 29:01.440]  really helping yourself with the blue wave no it's dead want revenge on the common housefly

[32:59.200 --> 33:15.680]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[33:16.800 --> 33:25.120]  info wars dot com is tomorrow's news today and now your host owin shroyer
[33:25.120 --> 33:33.520]  you know i found myself asking a question following the democrats right now in their
[33:33.520 --> 33:38.400]  street protesters which are out on the streets every day protesting ice for the separation
[33:38.400 --> 33:44.160]  of children well what what is ice immigration customs enforcement what does ice actually do
[33:44.160 --> 33:49.120]  well mostly they stop drugs and paraphernalia from coming into this country and and and gang
[33:49.120 --> 33:55.200]  members and child trafficking that's what they do the most of in fact they have a whole child
[33:55.200 --> 34:02.560]  trafficking division of ice that that has saved thousands of kids and so i'm looking into this
[34:03.440 --> 34:09.200]  and you see the leftist street mobs protesting ice for separating children they don't do that
[34:09.200 --> 34:14.080]  that's not ice ice doesn't separate the kids so so here's the here's the thing so think about this
[34:14.080 --> 34:22.400]  this just shows you how loony they are right now people show up at the border if it's children
[34:23.200 --> 34:26.720]  unaccompanied if it's children with adults if it's children with parents whatever the situation
[34:26.720 --> 34:33.520]  is adults go to the department of homeland security to be vetted children go to the
[34:33.520 --> 34:38.480]  department of health and human services to be vetted this has been policy for decades
[34:38.480 --> 34:45.280]  that's where the separation happens how does that equal ice well it doesn't
[34:46.720 --> 34:54.800]  now here's the trick though the democrats know that the democrats running this know
[34:54.800 --> 35:03.200]  that ice is not the one separating the kids it's the law that adults go to dhs kids go to hhs and
[35:03.200 --> 35:09.360]  then if we can we try to separate them after the vetting process that's what's been going on for
[35:09.360 --> 35:15.280]  decades but but so why and the democrats know this why are the democrats protesting ice we
[35:15.280 --> 35:20.240]  understand why the street mobs the hate the hate the hate mobs the leftist hate mobs we know why
[35:20.240 --> 35:25.600]  they protest ice they're clueless they're stupid they're ignorant they're brainwashed sheeple so
[35:25.600 --> 35:30.880]  they just do whatever they're told to do oh yeah ice bad occupy ice why are you occupying ice they're
[35:30.880 --> 35:37.120]  separating kids at the border no they're not that's dhs and hhs shut up racist great conversation
[35:37.120 --> 35:45.280]  that's how that goes but the democrats know that ice has nothing to do with it so why are the
[35:45.280 --> 35:54.080]  democrats calling for ice shutdown seriously i'm just asking the question ice keeps criminals and
[35:54.080 --> 35:59.600]  drugs and paraphernalia and child trafficking from stopping that's what ice does the most
[35:59.600 --> 36:06.400]  so why are the democrats trying to stop that just trying to just trying to figure it out that's all
[36:07.920 --> 36:15.040]  you know there's a story going around right now it's on infowars.com it's on daily caller it's
[36:15.040 --> 36:20.160]  a bunch of different places trump has been set up framed and persecuted by the intelligence community
[36:20.800 --> 36:24.560]  of course chuck schumer admitted that on msnbc phil mud admitted it they all admit it
[36:24.560 --> 36:30.400]  it and then you're crazy if you report on it but but here's the thing trump knows that okay he knows
[36:30.400 --> 36:34.400]  what's going on and and he's got them by the short hairs ladies and gentlemen all right it is my
[36:34.400 --> 36:41.760]  honor now to be joined by norris sweden and i hope i'm pronouncing that right he is the owner of the
[36:42.560 --> 36:50.400]  warrior one guns and ammo store that sasha baren cohen tried to troll just a bit ago and of course
[36:50.400 --> 36:55.200]  he caught them norris thank you for joining me today hey what's going on thanks for having me
[36:55.840 --> 37:01.040]  well you've pretty much gone viral because you called out sasha baren cohen and i guess
[37:01.040 --> 37:05.680]  i guess you're the first one to ever catch him this is a guy who's been doing this type of comedy
[37:05.680 --> 37:10.400]  skits and routines for a long time and he always gets away with it are you the first person to
[37:10.400 --> 37:16.640]  actually catch and stop sasha baren cohen in the act i guess so it's probably the first i heard of
[37:16.640 --> 37:25.040]  that so yeah you know that's good then well i'm trying to figure out what exactly goes on here so
[37:25.040 --> 37:30.720]  he thinks he's gonna make you look like an idiot in some way shape or form whatever his agenda is
[37:30.720 --> 37:35.520]  and you guys and based on other interviews you all were kind of suspicious at the beginning
[37:35.520 --> 37:39.360]  and then you said once he faked his hungarian accent that's when you knew it was an act
[37:40.320 --> 37:45.680]  yeah because they they called us and said listen uh the producers called they said we'd love to
[37:45.680 --> 37:51.920]  come in there and document a hungarian immigrant buying a gun hey listen this is america we love
[37:51.920 --> 37:58.960]  selling guns come on in um so they come in they set up he comes walking in and let me tell you
[37:58.960 --> 38:03.360]  you can see it on the camera i'm standing there in the corner as soon as he turns that corner and i
[38:03.360 --> 38:10.400]  see how he's dressed and how he looks i'm like okay this there's no way this is real now this is
[38:10.400 --> 38:15.920]  the angle that i haven't heard anyone else say and correct me if i'm wrong because the the whole
[38:15.920 --> 38:22.640]  report seems to be sasha uh sasha baron cohen is you know he's a jerk he's a clown how dare he you
[38:22.640 --> 38:29.120]  know he's he's fooling he's fooling politicians pretending to be a wounded warrior yeah that's
[38:29.120 --> 38:33.440]  classless but again this is the kind of stuff the guy's been doing faking like he's singing
[38:33.440 --> 38:38.160]  national anthem so so he's always kind of done this you're the first person at least anyone's
[38:38.160 --> 38:45.520]  knowledge that i know to ever stop him so this is my angle he tries to make the gun store owners
[38:45.520 --> 38:50.160]  and the gun store look like a bunch of idiots that's how they wanted to play this guess what
[38:50.160 --> 38:56.000]  they were the smartest people he ever dealt with so congratulations for proving to america
[38:56.000 --> 39:00.720]  that gun owners and second amendment activists are not a bunch of redneck hillbilly idiots
[39:00.720 --> 39:04.640]  they're actually some of the smartest and most aware people on earth so i salute you thank you
[39:04.640 --> 39:09.760]  for doing that for america you know and i appreciate that and you know what and that's
[39:09.760 --> 39:13.920]  and that's what the message i'm trying to give back is i'm trying to tell people listen
[39:15.200 --> 39:20.960]  second amendment is no different people that love guns i i love cars i collect cars people
[39:20.960 --> 39:25.840]  that go and buy comic books and collect comic books like a comic con there's no difference the
[39:25.840 --> 39:31.840]  problem is the problem is there's so much misinterpretation because nobody's willing
[39:31.840 --> 39:37.120]  to talk to the people that are behind the line listen i run a gun store i ran a gun store for
[39:37.120 --> 39:44.240]  over 10 years this stuff is my life it's my passion i know it okay i know what works and i know what
[39:44.240 --> 39:50.640]  doesn't work so listen you know whatever his name is his name is bore at to me stick to your dumb
[39:50.640 --> 39:57.520]  comedy because that's what you're good at so the part we're upset is where showtime starts to make
[39:57.520 --> 40:04.240]  guns try to look like toys by sticking stuffed animals on them yeah and again this is to make
[40:04.240 --> 40:09.600]  a whole joke of you know gun owners uh second amendment activists like they want to make this
[40:09.600 --> 40:15.360]  whole joke and and make this image of of people like you and just people that love the second
[40:15.360 --> 40:19.760]  amendment gun supporters like oh you're clowns you're ignorant you just you think this is a toy
[40:19.760 --> 40:24.480]  it will send borat in there he'll make you look stupid he'll really show you what's up and then
[40:24.480 --> 40:29.520]  know what happened is you showed him what's up and that this this false image and narrative that
[40:29.520 --> 40:35.120]  people have about gun owners and gun store owners is just entirely wrong yeah yeah and but here's the
[40:35.120 --> 40:40.240]  thing they did get their point across with that moron they put on the tv holding it with the bunny
[40:40.880 --> 40:47.840]  but see those guys are outdated those people that they fooled are outdated those lawmakers that they
[40:47.840 --> 40:53.840]  fooled and they basically made them look stupid it's because they're passing laws they're getting
[40:53.840 --> 40:57.840]  their votes they're getting their butts in the seat and then they forget about everybody else
[40:58.800 --> 41:03.600]  what has the response been like from other gun store owners i would imagine that a lot of gun
[41:03.600 --> 41:09.840]  store owners are reaching out to you saying thank you um you know it's actually i haven't heard any
[41:09.840 --> 41:15.200]  there's maybe one or two gun store owners from the other states but the amount of phone calls
[41:15.200 --> 41:21.840]  i'm getting probably three to four hundred phone calls a day emails 150 to 200 a day of people just
[41:21.840 --> 41:26.480]  saying thank you you know what norris they go the way you're representing the second amendment
[41:26.480 --> 41:31.600]  but you're also saying that listen i welcome the negative side of the second amendment if you want
[41:31.600 --> 41:37.440]  to come talk to me and have a nice conversation and talk about this i'm open to it i've already
[41:37.440 --> 41:42.960]  challenged the politicians i said listen call me because the laws you're passing are not the right
[41:42.960 --> 41:48.640]  laws they don't work in california they don't you know and i've told people listen i used to be a cop
[41:48.640 --> 41:53.360]  criminals don't come in and say hey uh norris listen i like to buy a gun and in 10 days when
[41:53.360 --> 42:00.240]  i pick it up i'm going to go commit a crime that doesn't work well and i would imagine that not
[42:00.240 --> 42:04.880]  only the phone calls but i imagine business has probably picked up for you i'm shocked more gun
[42:04.880 --> 42:10.480]  store owners haven't called and thank you because he thought i guarantee you based on the way he was
[42:10.480 --> 42:15.360]  acting and how fake it was he thought that you guys were probably lowest iq he thought that this
[42:15.360 --> 42:19.040]  would be real easy oh yeah i'll go in there be a hungarian immigrant dressed like some sort of
[42:19.040 --> 42:23.920]  clown situation so he i mean that shows you how low that how little they thought of you and again
[42:23.920 --> 42:30.400]  he ends up being the jackass yeah and listen i don't mind it i don't mind it if you think you can
[42:30.400 --> 42:36.800]  for me come on in i do this every single day i talk to people every day i get to know people's
[42:36.800 --> 42:42.080]  true intentions so what makes you think you can walk into my store and i'm not going to spot your
[42:42.080 --> 42:47.840]  ass and understand exactly what you're trying to do this is what i do every day show me somebody
[42:47.840 --> 42:54.000]  that does it better than a gunstore owner yeah you know what and that's very true again gunstore
[42:54.000 --> 43:00.640]  owners are that responsible folks he can spot a phony from a mile away that's what it's anyone who
[43:00.640 --> 43:08.400]  studied history and knows how human systems work is horrified we have global hardcore anti-human
[43:08.400 --> 43:13.760]  psychopaths in control the big corporations they're trying to wreck free market and consolidate
[43:13.760 --> 43:19.760]  total control dumb humanity down ahead of replacing us with machines and trump has come in and is
[43:19.760 --> 43:24.880]  resisting that and saying we have a human future they are launching a civil war against nation states
[43:24.880 --> 43:30.320]  right now collapsing our borders and my only message is this everybody better wake up and realize
[43:30.320 --> 43:35.360]  the fight is now everybody should be very very urgent because the left and the globalist are
[43:35.360 --> 43:41.440]  frantic and launching their anti-human plan because they crave to control people those of us that are
[43:41.440 --> 43:45.840]  pro-human don't crave power we already have the power but we have to realize these scum

[47:27.040 --> 47:34.000]  your host oan treuer norah sweden is with me here for one more segment he is the owner
[47:34.800 --> 47:40.000]  of warrior one guns and ammo very popular guns and ammo store out in california where
[47:40.560 --> 47:49.120]  sasha baron borat cohen borat borat borat ali g borat thought that he could troll the gun store
[47:49.120 --> 47:55.280]  make gun owners and gun store owners look like fools oops it turned out they outsmarted him
[47:55.280 --> 48:01.280]  easily and he ended up looking like the fool um i i did have a question for you about something
[48:01.280 --> 48:05.280]  said in the last segment but before i got to that i was just curious norm uh norris if there's
[48:05.280 --> 48:10.000]  anything you wanted to share with our audience about that experience of of booting borat from
[48:10.000 --> 48:18.480]  your store after he tried to fool you you know um i love i love doing that i really did and i'm glad
[48:18.480 --> 48:24.960]  um that dude's outdated it shows outdated that we just enjoyed doing it you know if short time wants
[48:24.960 --> 48:30.240]  to show we have a show for them the funny thing is that we just got done shooting a pilot before
[48:30.240 --> 48:36.080]  they walked in a week ago yeah and you actually thought that's why they were targeting you yeah
[48:36.080 --> 48:41.440]  because we actually said well how you know yeah we're popular and what's the best place to pick
[48:41.440 --> 48:47.840]  is california so maybe they got wind we just got done shooting a pilot for our show down the barrel
[48:47.840 --> 48:52.560]  and um maybe that's why they targeted me which looks pretty badass i mean i got to tell you
[48:52.560 --> 48:58.000]  that the preview you put out looks like it's pretty well produced well here's the thing it is
[48:58.000 --> 49:03.840]  because it's coming from a major network but here's the thing brother it's about real people
[49:03.840 --> 49:10.800]  buying real guns for real reasons from all demographics of life like single moms why do
[49:10.800 --> 49:16.560]  they need a gun in the house what's the correct way to have a gun in the house so it's the real
[49:16.560 --> 49:23.280]  deal it's not some moron putting a buddy on a gun and walking around and making everybody
[49:23.280 --> 49:29.600]  look dumb like i said those people are outdated so so is it kind of like pawn stars or something
[49:29.600 --> 49:37.280]  but but for a gun store it's it's better it's better it's it's not script it's real it's real
[49:37.280 --> 49:43.920]  decisions it's going over real guns that's that's the awesome thing about it yeah you know what
[49:43.920 --> 49:48.960]  that really is powerful and that may have been why they decided to target you guys because that
[49:48.960 --> 49:54.000]  because i saw the the preview you guys put out it's it's badass it's clean and now the way you
[49:54.000 --> 49:58.560]  lay out the the show plan i mean that's that's going to be a successful show there's no doubt
[49:58.560 --> 50:02.960]  about that and the cool thing is that's something people can relate to you know what i'm saying
[50:02.960 --> 50:06.560]  because people can watch that and be like oh wow that makes sense maybe i should get that weapon
[50:06.560 --> 50:13.360]  for home defense absolutely absolutely listen it will make you cry it will make you laugh the different
[50:13.360 --> 50:21.120]  demographics you do it listen i even talk to somebody who's an anti-gun okay that's what the
[50:21.120 --> 50:26.400]  show's about too and so you're basically just filming this as people are coming in to tell
[50:26.400 --> 50:31.200]  their stories absolutely why do you need a gun because listen you don't just come in and buy a
[50:31.200 --> 50:36.080]  gun and walk out listen if we get a bad feeling about you i'll kick your butt out of the store
[50:36.080 --> 50:41.280]  we won't sell you a gun i don't need your money i do this because i love it and i want people
[50:41.280 --> 50:46.080]  to be protected because i don't want them to be a victim you don't want to buy a gun listen
[50:46.080 --> 50:51.200]  i'll sell you a taser i'll sell you a pepper spray don't buy a gun put an alarm on the house
[50:51.200 --> 50:57.120]  at the end of the day protect yourself from protect your family that's really what i care about
[50:57.120 --> 51:02.800]  well and you and you prove that that you you know you're gonna give a fair you know breakdown
[51:02.800 --> 51:06.400]  you're gonna say okay this individual looks deranged or this individual looks fake i'm
[51:06.400 --> 51:09.680]  sorry we're not taking it that got caught that went viral and now you guys are going to be even
[51:09.680 --> 51:14.480]  bigger and and your show is going to be even bigger now you said something in the last segment
[51:14.480 --> 51:19.360]  that i wanted to ask you about you're a former cop and a lot of people would be shocked by this but
[51:19.360 --> 51:25.920]  as a former cop would you say that you want more citizens to be armed you know here's what i want
[51:25.920 --> 51:30.800]  the best way to put it i want the right citizens to be armed because let me explain to you why
[51:30.800 --> 51:36.480]  carrying a gun a lot of people don't understand it's a huge responsibility it's not hollywood
[51:36.480 --> 51:41.360]  bullets don't go where bullets are supposed to go you have to be trained you have to have the
[51:41.360 --> 51:47.120]  tactical awareness to understand when something's gonna happen you might have a gun you might be
[51:47.120 --> 51:51.760]  with your family you might not have the right opportunity the right chance to take advantage
[51:51.760 --> 51:57.440]  of that tactical situation so you would want the right people with the gun because listen
[51:57.440 --> 52:01.840]  the most important things you got to protect yourself and your family okay so even as a cop
[52:01.840 --> 52:07.680]  when i carried a gun i always checked my surroundings makes it's not paranoia it's
[52:07.680 --> 52:13.120]  situational awareness and knowing when's the opportunity so you want the right people with the
[52:13.120 --> 52:19.760]  gun all right let's finish and let's go back to borat here have you heard from from borat and
[52:19.760 --> 52:25.520]  his team since that you booted them from the store no no even the day i booted them out
[52:25.520 --> 52:30.560]  when i was confronting the producers they weren't giving me any answers all their answers were vague
[52:30.560 --> 52:35.760]  and it was i got upset and there's some stuff i said that was nasty to them and i basically i kicked
[52:35.760 --> 52:41.760]  them out of the store because don't come into my store don't don't play me don't mess around i had
[52:41.760 --> 52:46.640]  my blood and sweat and tears are in this business and if you're not going to answer what i'm asking
[52:46.640 --> 52:52.800]  then you're going to get the bad side and once again you are the perfect example of the type
[52:52.800 --> 52:57.200]  of gunstore owners and the type of people that are second amendment activists you're not going to be
[52:57.200 --> 53:03.040]  fooled you're aware you understand your environment and if somebody's trying to play you you're going
[53:03.040 --> 53:06.480]  to call them out on it and then it's amazing i can't believe they never even reached out say
[53:06.480 --> 53:10.880]  hey sorry or hey can you leave us alone i mean that shows you you really did just totally
[53:10.880 --> 53:16.080]  destroy them they they they don't even want to think about this anymore oh and you know what
[53:16.080 --> 53:20.880]  you're right and you know what you put you said the best word i'm going to destroy this show that
[53:20.880 --> 53:27.200]  they're trying to do you know what stick to your stupid comedy don't put toys on guns that's the
[53:27.200 --> 53:33.200]  part that bothers me the most so i'm going to make sure this thing flops and i've called out show time
[53:33.200 --> 53:41.040]  and i'll call out borah i really don't care so they're here making a mockery of guns while you
[53:41.040 --> 53:46.480]  have democrats basically calling for the second amendment to be revoked i mean it's a it's the
[53:46.480 --> 53:51.680]  delusion of these people a it's unamerican but you know b it's like you know if you're going to
[53:51.680 --> 53:55.760]  sit here and try to take gun violence seriously and stuff why are you making jokes about it
[53:56.480 --> 54:00.400]  you know the funny thing is you just said the perfect word gun violence you know what i saw
[54:00.400 --> 54:07.520]  this morning i saw the students and talking to the mayor of la um you know they're going against
[54:07.520 --> 54:13.280]  gun violence and then i saw an astronaut which i'm sorry that happened to his wife guess what people
[54:13.280 --> 54:20.560]  it's not gun violence it's people violence okay um why is an astronaut trying to pitch for gun
[54:20.560 --> 54:27.120]  control listen bud stick to being an astronaut i don't go talking about reverse thrusters okay
[54:27.120 --> 54:33.600]  stick to what you know come and talk to the people that know the business i know the business
[54:33.600 --> 54:40.320]  hey politicians look up warrior one guns and ammo and call me i will help you to get the correct
[54:40.320 --> 54:46.560]  laws that work that don't hurt people in the second amendment but hurt the criminals because the
[54:46.560 --> 54:51.360]  criminals are laughing they're laughing because they're like listen everything they're passing
[54:51.360 --> 54:56.880]  is not hurting the second amendment i mean it is hurting the second amendment it's not hurting
[54:56.880 --> 55:02.080]  them it's hurting us well exactly it's hurting law abiding citizens people that actually follow
[55:02.080 --> 55:08.480]  their laws and it's incredible when you have a story like kate steinle's murder where that criminal
[55:08.480 --> 55:12.720]  was able to get a gun he shouldn't even have been in the country but he's able to get a gun
[55:12.720 --> 55:18.960]  shoot an american citizen dead and yet no calls for the gun control after that just calls for oh
[55:18.960 --> 55:25.760]  don't be mean to the poor illegal immigrant you know and i'm telling you criminals get guns they get
[55:25.760 --> 55:31.360]  them i used to be a cop they don't they don't get them from a store they just don't it doesn't it
[55:31.360 --> 55:36.720]  doesn't work like that and that's what's upsetting is that you have people pushing for gun control
[55:36.720 --> 55:42.400]  but listen you don't know anything about guns you don't know what it takes to sell a gun you don't
[55:42.400 --> 55:47.840]  talk to talk to me talk to the employees you see what they go through and let me tell you doj
[55:47.840 --> 55:55.360]  doj in california does a phenomenal job every time i call doj i get an answer they help me
[55:55.360 --> 56:01.440]  and they're overwhelmed you know i mean so we i i talk to doj all the time like guys hey this
[56:01.440 --> 56:06.880]  doesn't make sense we're like they're like norris we just can't keep up we can't keep up with the
[56:06.880 --> 56:12.720]  laws that are being passed you know being in the industry and out there in california where
[56:12.720 --> 56:18.480]  you have a bunch of anti gunners in in congress out there in your representation what what would
[56:18.480 --> 56:23.280]  you say the dichotomy is between the people are they kind of going more pro second amendment
[56:23.280 --> 56:27.920]  anti second amendment versus the democrats in congress that are that are going against the
[56:27.920 --> 56:36.160]  second amendment you know it's it's both ways man it's both ways you got the people that are all
[56:36.160 --> 56:41.360]  for all the second amendment and you got people that are completely second amendment but there's
[56:41.360 --> 56:48.960]  a gap that gap is there's misinterpretation on both sides and you know i stayed out of this
[56:48.960 --> 56:55.120]  for a long time until this happened and now i'm in it and i just i need to find a way
[56:55.120 --> 57:00.080]  to close that gap it's going to be hard it really is but let me ask you something when somebody
[57:00.080 --> 57:06.960]  drinks and drives um who gets in trouble do they go after the alcohol do they go after the car
[57:06.960 --> 57:13.280]  manufacturer no it's that person that's responsible that drank and got behind the wheel so why is it
[57:13.280 --> 57:19.120]  every time gun violence happened it's the gun gun gun gun gun gun gun because it's coming from the
[57:19.120 --> 57:23.600]  other side that are just screaming gun control because they don't have the knowledge of everything
[57:23.600 --> 57:28.240]  they don't know everything they don't know the rules they don't know the laws because
[57:28.240 --> 57:34.640]  the democrats like you said are passing laws that don't make any sense and it's a political agenda
[57:34.640 --> 57:39.680]  and i think that example you just gave proves that it's a political agenda norah sweden thank you

[1:00:15.920 --> 1:00:19.280]  trump attack you know what i'm not even going to go down it is more fake news trying to smear
[1:00:19.280 --> 1:00:25.840]  trump but let's go to a couple videos here let's first go to ran paul calling out the trump
[1:00:25.840 --> 1:00:32.400]  derangement syndrome coming to the senate guys let's roll clip nine trump derangement syndrome
[1:00:32.400 --> 1:00:39.840]  has officially come to the senate the hatred for the president is so intense that partisans
[1:00:39.840 --> 1:00:47.200]  would rather risk war than give diplomacy a chance does anybody remember that ronald reagan sat down
[1:00:47.200 --> 1:00:53.760]  with corbachev and we lessened the nuclear tensions we need to still have those openings nobody is
[1:00:53.760 --> 1:00:59.840]  saying or excusing russia's meddling in our elections absolutely we should protect the
[1:00:59.840 --> 1:01:06.640]  integrity of our elections but simply bringing the hatred of the president to the senate floor
[1:01:06.640 --> 1:01:12.480]  in order to say we're done with diplomacy we're going to add more sanctions and more sanctions
[1:01:12.480 --> 1:01:18.560]  you know what i would rather that we still have open channels of discussion with the russians
[1:01:19.120 --> 1:01:24.640]  kennedy at the height of the cold war had a direct line to khrushchev and it may have
[1:01:24.640 --> 1:01:31.360]  prevented the end of the world should we be so crazy about partisanship that we now say we
[1:01:31.360 --> 1:01:35.760]  don't want to talk to the russians we're not going to have relations with the russians we should
[1:01:35.760 --> 1:01:42.240]  stand firm and say stay the hell out of our elections but we should not stick our head in
[1:01:42.240 --> 1:01:47.040]  the ground and say we're not going to talk to them i would like to see the russians leave
[1:01:47.040 --> 1:01:51.680]  ukraine i think we could do it through diplomacy we're not going to have it if we don't talk to
[1:01:51.680 --> 1:01:56.240]  them i would like to see the russians help more with north korea with denuclearization of the
[1:01:56.240 --> 1:02:01.760]  korean peninsula we're not going to have it if we just simply heat more sanctions on and say we're
[1:02:01.760 --> 1:02:06.480]  not going to talk to the russians and anybody that talks to the russians has committed treason
[1:02:06.480 --> 1:02:13.600]  for goodness sakes we have the former head of the cia john brannon gallivanting across tv
[1:02:13.600 --> 1:02:21.280]  now being paid for his opinion to call the president treasoness this has got to stop this is crazy
[1:02:21.280 --> 1:02:27.920]  hatred of the president this is crazy partisanship that is driving this for goodness sakes we don't
[1:02:27.920 --> 1:02:34.400]  excuse russia's behavior in our election but we don't have to have war we can so is ran paul the
[1:02:34.400 --> 1:02:42.400]  last sane man in congress here trying to talk the left down and because of the lies of the left
[1:02:42.400 --> 1:02:48.000]  and even eric swalwell going on tucker carlson unbelievable segment that was i think it was
[1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:52.560]  tuesday or wednesday night swalwell goes on carlson calls donald trump treasoness ten times
[1:02:52.560 --> 1:02:57.200]  carlson that says what did he do the treasoness what did he do he has nothing he just says treason
[1:02:57.200 --> 1:03:05.040]  treason treason what treason uh treason and this is what happens now massed leftists fling
[1:03:05.040 --> 1:03:15.120]  feces at pro trump cafe anger in the streets when a kosher cafe opens and boil heights
[1:03:15.120 --> 1:03:20.400]  neighbors want it shut down the la pd kept protesters back as demonstrators shouted at
[1:03:20.400 --> 1:03:24.880]  people at the grand opening they're not just angry over gentrification it's the owner's views
[1:03:24.880 --> 1:03:29.840]  that also have them riled up kick on lines dave lopez is live and boil heights with details on
[1:03:29.840 --> 1:03:36.160]  the controversy dave well standing in front of this cafe the man who owns this is an immigrant
[1:03:36.160 --> 1:03:40.640]  he has a number of companies very successful businessman of his 70 employees he told me
[1:03:40.640 --> 1:03:46.240]  that nearly all of them are immigrants he also said he supports trump and his immigration policies
[1:03:46.240 --> 1:03:52.640]  and because he posted that that's where all the problems started so what's the connection
[1:03:52.640 --> 1:03:57.360]  but this is what i don't understand i'm confused the connection between donald trump and a good
[1:03:57.360 --> 1:04:02.720]  coffee 30 years ago asher shalom immigrated from his native israel to the united states
[1:04:02.720 --> 1:04:07.760]  he told me he cried like a baby when he became a us citizen and he also said he supports donald
[1:04:07.760 --> 1:04:13.520]  trump and his immigration policies and he can't understand why that's so wrong everything changed
[1:04:13.520 --> 1:04:18.480]  in one day he was all set for a grand opening of his new kosher cafe and boil heights not far from
[1:04:18.480 --> 1:04:23.040]  downtown los angeles the boil heights chamber of commerce had invited him to be a member
[1:04:23.040 --> 1:04:26.160]  they were going to be there to help celebrate so there you go then he got this email from the
[1:04:26.160 --> 1:04:31.360]  channel so you can't you can't i mean there's an immigrant pro trump like trump and this is what
[1:04:31.360 --> 1:04:35.520]  i'm saying the left is so deranged and out of control and ignorant they don't even understand
[1:04:35.520 --> 1:04:42.640]  what they're dealing with but to the cafe owner that doesn't understand what's going on these are
[1:04:42.640 --> 1:04:47.680]  mentally deranged people they have trump derangement syndrome they're mentally deranged don't
[1:04:47.680 --> 1:04:52.960]  look for logic and reason with these people just understand they're filled with hate and rage and
[1:04:52.960 --> 1:05:01.520]  ignorance it's trump derangement syndrome i want to plow into all of this that i'm going to spend a
[1:05:01.520 --> 1:05:08.800]  few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water

[1:06:06.560 --> 1:06:20.160]  defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's alex jones and now your host
[1:06:20.160 --> 1:06:26.560]  owens shroyer this is an emergency message to the president of the united states the american
[1:06:26.560 --> 1:06:32.160]  people the people of the world mr president i know that you're fully aware that the big tech giants
[1:06:32.160 --> 1:06:39.760]  apple google facebook twitter and others are 100 percent diametrically opposed to free market
[1:06:39.760 --> 1:06:46.160]  capitalism and they hate america they have a arrogant elitism they're allied with communist
[1:06:46.160 --> 1:06:51.840]  china apple has moved to communist china and given the code keys uh to the government officially
[1:06:51.840 --> 1:06:59.760]  china even controls people trying to send taiwan flag emojis that is the total level of control
[1:06:59.760 --> 1:07:09.520]  that we're witnessing and now myself and many others have forced this issue of censorship
[1:07:10.800 --> 1:07:18.000]  out into the open with your help and the spokespersons and heads of these companies
[1:07:18.000 --> 1:07:23.840]  have testified to congress multiple times the last few months and completely and totally lied
[1:07:23.840 --> 1:07:31.520]  to everyone just on tuesday they had hearings in the judiciary committee where they misrepresented
[1:07:31.520 --> 1:07:36.240]  what i and others talk about and then called for us to be completely banned uh off of those
[1:07:36.880 --> 1:07:43.200]  platforms preemptively and became a big national news story the executives went on to say that they
[1:07:43.200 --> 1:07:50.640]  only restrict violent or hateful uh posts that violate their terms but then of course uh people
[1:07:50.640 --> 1:07:56.800]  began to actually go and look at their tweets and found that they are being shadow banned at record
[1:07:56.800 --> 1:08:03.120]  levels there's an article at zero hedge dot com to post it in full at info wars dot com
[1:08:03.120 --> 1:08:07.120]  i'll read from in a moment twitter caught censoring conservative journalists with site
[1:08:07.120 --> 1:08:14.160]  wide shadow bans that's july 20th 2018 before i get to that though here's the bottom line up front
[1:08:14.160 --> 1:08:21.280]  no one is being censored like donald john trump 45th president of the united states
[1:08:22.400 --> 1:08:27.840]  no one is being censored like you mr president and anyone who has a twitter account who follows
[1:08:27.840 --> 1:08:36.720]  you knows that 90 plus percent of your tweets never make it through to them you have to go
[1:08:36.720 --> 1:08:42.240]  to the actual twitter page your twitter page really their twitter page you have to read them
[1:08:42.240 --> 1:08:50.880]  there you have to then go into the settings and change the settings so that the quality filter is
[1:08:50.880 --> 1:08:56.080]  turned off to be able to get your tweets now that's just one way they're doing this to you sir
[1:08:57.040 --> 1:09:03.280]  and when i go and turn that filter off every few days they go in with an auto correct in
[1:09:03.280 --> 1:09:09.680]  their words and turn it back on and that's just one way they're doing it and so the only way to
[1:09:09.680 --> 1:09:15.280]  stop this ahead of the midterm elections and stop them from violating our free speech and
[1:09:16.720 --> 1:09:21.200]  bringing their level of bullying and intimidation to the next level against the american people
[1:09:21.200 --> 1:09:28.960]  trying to struggle free from their control is for you with your bully pulpit second to none to bring
[1:09:28.960 --> 1:09:34.560]  all of this information out to to consult with your tech experts like your campaign 2020 had
[1:09:34.560 --> 1:09:40.480]  who's an expert to put a report together and then to bring that report to the american people
[1:09:41.360 --> 1:09:45.680]  we've written a report with mike adams at info wars dot com that i know has been sent to the
[1:09:45.680 --> 1:09:50.960]  white house and sent to the campaign and sent to members of congress it's called the adams report
[1:09:50.960 --> 1:09:56.800]  it deals with the covert censorship operation how to expose it and how to reverse it and how
[1:09:58.000 --> 1:10:03.520]  to defeat it but without you doing that this is just going to intensify europe has basically
[1:10:03.520 --> 1:10:10.720]  completely censored nationalist conservatives people that are into free market it's an iron curtain
[1:10:11.520 --> 1:10:17.520]  of control that we didn't even see during the old soviet days this is this is massive and again
[1:10:17.520 --> 1:10:23.680]  only you can devastate this with a hundred percent chance of victory it's very hard for all of us
[1:10:23.680 --> 1:10:29.520]  laboring under this to be able to expose it when these tech heads get before congress and lie and
[1:10:29.520 --> 1:10:35.280]  lie and lie you talk about very fake news this is extreme fraud because they know it violates
[1:10:35.280 --> 1:10:39.920]  people's rights en masse people's civil rights and human rights en masse they know it's a form of
[1:10:39.920 --> 1:10:47.280]  racketeering they know that it's an electronic gulag as matt drives has called it and they know
[1:10:47.280 --> 1:10:53.040]  that they're trying to kick the n r a out of commerce your supporters out of banking i mean
[1:10:53.040 --> 1:10:58.960]  this is a real purge going on we need you to stand up for yourself the first amendment
[1:10:58.960 --> 1:11:05.840]  for right to the market right to commerce and for the american people so here's the article out of
[1:11:05.840 --> 1:11:11.120]  zero hedge up on info wars dot com repart of it twitter consensoring conservative journalists
[1:11:11.120 --> 1:11:19.200]  with sign wide shadow bands which prevent anyone not already following them from viewing their post
[1:11:19.200 --> 1:11:24.160]  two days after twitter told congress that they aren't politically biased when censoring content
[1:11:24.160 --> 1:11:28.800]  several prominent conservatives discovered that the social media giant automatically includes them
[1:11:28.800 --> 1:11:36.480]  in a site wide quality filter discrimination shadow band which permits anyone not already
[1:11:36.480 --> 1:11:41.200]  following them from viewing their post notice it has the word discrimination they admit they're
[1:11:41.200 --> 1:11:46.960]  discriminating against us while the filters have been around since 2016 and were supercharged in
[1:11:46.960 --> 1:11:51.760]  may i have the elections twitter aggressive censorship of conservative accounts was noticed
[1:11:52.320 --> 1:11:58.720]  thursday afternoon by daily wires ryan savadero oh notice the daily wires been very happy for
[1:11:58.720 --> 1:12:03.120]  me to get censored but now they don't like it good i'm glad they're starting to wake up after he
[1:12:03.120 --> 1:12:10.560]  said he saw reduced activity following a viral tweet with 3.85 million views in which democrat
[1:12:10.560 --> 1:12:16.000]  representative maxine waters calls for tax on members of the tone administration in short a
[1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:21.520]  flood of influential conservative twitter users discovered they were shadow band also using an
[1:12:21.520 --> 1:12:28.160]  account checking tool at shadow band dot eu and then it goes through screenshots and all the proof
[1:12:28.160 --> 1:12:37.280]  and all the example for five pages continuing twitter vp of trust and safety oh well sounds
[1:12:37.280 --> 1:12:43.760]  like the little white van around the neighborhood twitter vp of trust and safety del harvey said
[1:12:43.760 --> 1:12:49.920]  that the filtering algorithm looks at a number of signals including how often a user is blocked
[1:12:49.920 --> 1:12:56.080]  muted or complained about versus receiving positive interactions such as favorites and retweets so
[1:12:56.080 --> 1:13:01.360]  they created an algorithm where their people complain on you and they shadow band and block you
[1:13:01.360 --> 1:13:05.920]  then they further shadow band you if you send the same messages to four people and two of them
[1:13:05.920 --> 1:13:11.520]  blocked you and one reported you we could assume without ever seeing that content of the message
[1:13:11.520 --> 1:13:17.360]  was that was generally a negative interaction okay if i try to send out something pro trump
[1:13:18.400 --> 1:13:23.440]  most of the time it just goes into moderation it won't even let me post it i mean this is the level
[1:13:23.440 --> 1:13:28.720]  of what they've done to paul octon's twitter my twitter they're they're cheating they can't help
[1:13:28.720 --> 1:13:34.720]  it that they want to steal the election they want to muffle the american people ask whether the changes
[1:13:34.720 --> 1:13:38.800]  will mostly affect fake accounts that's their cover and bots are real people who are behaving
[1:13:38.800 --> 1:13:44.480]  in aggressive and divisive waves harvey said it would be either it could be either the software
[1:13:44.480 --> 1:13:49.600]  goal is to hide tweets from accounts that are having the maximum negative impact on the conversation
[1:13:49.600 --> 1:13:54.000]  that means disagreeing with them like you when they call you a russian agent or a traitor that
[1:13:54.000 --> 1:13:58.320]  needs to be killed and then you say that's not true well they just ban that twitter blocking
[1:13:59.520 --> 1:14:04.160]  harvey also said in a company blog post that the impact of the filters could affect
[1:14:04.160 --> 1:14:10.400]  much less than one percent of accounts that is total absolute horse manure every major libertarian
[1:14:10.400 --> 1:14:16.400]  or conservative who's going and looking at their accounts now notices that they've been dialed back
[1:14:16.400 --> 1:14:20.400]  their reach and then a lot of their tweets get completely shadow banned and that's the bottom
[1:14:20.400 --> 1:14:26.240]  line and then it just goes through all of this now here's how you can mitigate it but they'll
[1:14:26.240 --> 1:14:31.840]  just keep flipping it back on to turn the default quality filtering off go to your twitter settings
[1:14:31.840 --> 1:14:39.280]  and unclick the quality filtered box we wonder who jack dorsi thinks he is having a maximum quote
[1:14:39.280 --> 1:14:46.000]  negative impact on the conversation right ahead of the midterms right on time again it is the
[1:14:46.000 --> 1:14:53.760]  quality filter applied to your account find out in the shadow ban dot eu then go there to speak
[1:14:53.760 --> 1:14:59.040]  freely again we are starting the national debate about this we're forcing the issue out there
[1:14:59.920 --> 1:15:04.640]  but to turbocharge this and ensure victory for the first amendment and for the elections to
[1:15:04.640 --> 1:15:13.040]  make america great again we need you and your experts and your allies in congress to spearhead
[1:15:13.040 --> 1:15:18.720]  this because so far these hearings have been disgraceful and the tech heads have been leading
[1:15:18.720 --> 1:15:23.680]  the congressman and women around by their noses and it has been just pathetic and disgraceful
[1:15:23.680 --> 1:15:28.720]  and sad to watch these liars run circles around us trying to steal our republic and trying to
[1:15:28.720 --> 1:15:33.040]  steal the right of our discourse in this nation while being deceptive about it thank you mr

[1:19:02.000 --> 1:19:07.520]  the real drama can be found here in leilani estates but a lot of us on the big island rely on rain
[1:19:07.520 --> 1:19:13.920]  water and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain volcanic ash may contain heavy metal
[1:19:13.920 --> 1:19:20.400]  particles and acid rain could lower the ph of the water to unhealthy levels to find out we employ
[1:19:20.400 --> 1:19:26.880]  a series of tests for heavy metals alkalinity and ph what we learned was that there was in
[1:19:26.880 --> 1:19:32.880]  fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater next we tested the water from
[1:19:32.880 --> 1:19:38.960]  our alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure but the
[1:19:38.960 --> 1:19:45.680]  ph was also restored to optimal levels as it turns out the filter on the alexa pure raises
[1:19:45.680 --> 1:19:51.520]  the ph of the water so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a
[1:19:51.520 --> 1:19:57.200]  rainwater supply but more importantly a good water filtration system will purify it
[1:19:57.200 --> 1:20:07.920]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:20:13.440 --> 1:20:20.640]  and now the tip of the spear leading the fight to take back the nation it's
[1:20:20.640 --> 1:20:28.800]  olyn shroyer you're listening to the alex jones show the left in america has become totally
[1:20:28.800 --> 1:20:34.720]  unhinged and that's why you have hashtag walk away trending on twitter and you have the hashtag
[1:20:34.720 --> 1:20:40.080]  walk away fan site on youtube with hundreds of people explaining why they're walking away
[1:20:40.080 --> 1:20:46.560]  really powerful stuff there actually and i'm looking to get brandon struck back on the alex
[1:20:46.560 --> 1:20:54.640]  jones show next week this whole zuckerberg holocaust denial comment seems to be doubling back
[1:20:54.640 --> 1:21:00.560]  and it looks like they're going to try to use this to force zuckerberg's hand to ban info wars
[1:21:00.560 --> 1:21:04.800]  or that may have been the plan to begin with because now he's walking it back and they keep
[1:21:04.800 --> 1:21:09.600]  saying we're conspiracy theorists we have to be shut down then though abc news is going to put the
[1:21:09.600 --> 1:21:14.800]  fake news out street fighters and militia understanding the oathkeepers and the proud boys
[1:21:14.800 --> 1:21:20.720]  the oathkeepers that's that's ridiculous to even claim that about them and then the proud boys just
[1:21:20.720 --> 1:21:24.800]  go out they're the ones that get attacked and they just happen to be bigger and stronger than
[1:21:24.800 --> 1:21:29.840]  the little antifa wusses and they just pound them into the ground but this is what they're doing so
[1:21:30.560 --> 1:21:35.440]  meghan kanile writes this fake headline trying to tell you that oathkeepers and proud boys are
[1:21:35.440 --> 1:21:42.960]  racist street fighters and so racist street fighters and anti-government militia understanding
[1:21:42.960 --> 1:21:48.240]  the proud boys and oathkeepers totally fake totally false and then they try to lump info wars in with
[1:21:48.240 --> 1:21:52.640]  holocaust deniers so that facebook twitter youtube ban us and so that's what they're doing
[1:21:54.480 --> 1:22:00.000]  but but they have this whole trump derangement syndrome going on where they're all acting totally
[1:22:00.000 --> 1:22:08.160]  unhinged for example whoopee goldberg need to come up with a new nickname for her whoopee gold turd
[1:22:08.160 --> 1:22:15.520]  whoopee gold turd uh you know you come up with the name just totally unhinged she goes on her show
[1:22:15.520 --> 1:22:21.120]  the view says that she doesn't have trump derangement syndrome and then exhibits trump derangement
[1:22:21.120 --> 1:22:26.400]  syndrome to jenny uh judge janine let's watch that clip and i don't have trump derangement let me
[1:22:26.400 --> 1:22:32.960]  tell you what i have okay i have a lot of i'm tired of people starting a conversation with
[1:22:32.960 --> 1:22:39.280]  mexicans or liars and rapers i'm tired of people starting a conversation about this
[1:22:40.400 --> 1:22:45.520]  listen i'm 62 years old there have been a lot of people in office that i didn't agree with
[1:22:45.520 --> 1:22:52.880]  but i have never ever seen anything like this i've never seen anybody whip up such hate
[1:22:52.880 --> 1:22:56.000]  i've never seen no that's you whoopee you're the one whipping up hatred
[1:22:58.080 --> 1:23:01.840]  and judge janine just sits there classy smiling like yeah embarrass yourself so you
[1:23:01.840 --> 1:23:07.680]  don't know that i don't suffer from that what i suffer from is the inability to figure out how
[1:23:07.680 --> 1:23:13.040]  to fix this that's my issue but one of the things that you talk about a lot and i'm curious about
[1:23:13.040 --> 1:23:19.200]  it is the deep state how long has the deep state been there and who's running it well the i want
[1:23:19.200 --> 1:23:24.160]  to answer your question because you gave you had to ask you a question i opening statement which is
[1:23:24.160 --> 1:23:32.560]  how horrible it is at donald trump no i'm sorry baby that's what you said you said you said that
[1:23:32.560 --> 1:23:37.040]  it was it's okay people shouldn't be here end up murdering the children of americans you know what's
[1:23:37.040 --> 1:23:42.560]  horrible what's horrible when the president of the united states whips up people to beat the hell out
[1:23:42.560 --> 1:23:53.840]  of people no thank you so there's whoopee golberg going totally insane she ends up walking off the
[1:23:53.840 --> 1:24:00.880]  set ripping her cards up and really it's just she look see it's this fake this is this fake hollywood
[1:24:00.880 --> 1:24:05.760]  television thing like whoopee golberg is anybody because she was in a couple famous movies and
[1:24:05.760 --> 1:24:10.960]  might have been a funny actor at one time uh you know beneath the surface of that whoopee golberg
[1:24:10.960 --> 1:24:16.720]  you can tell is a very low iq deranged individual unfortunately and she exhibits that perfectly
[1:24:16.720 --> 1:24:24.240]  in that segment but it gets worse after she stormed off the set during her deranged tirade she
[1:24:24.240 --> 1:24:29.040]  confronted judge janine pierrow which she recounts on the sean hannity radio show yesterday listen to
[1:24:29.040 --> 1:24:39.440]  this on what happened was i realized the segment was over i got up uh and i i just started i left
[1:24:39.440 --> 1:24:46.000]  the stage going downstairs and i saw her and i had to walk by her and i said whoopee i fought for
[1:24:46.000 --> 1:24:51.520]  victims my whole life something like that and she started cursing at me what did she say
[1:24:51.520 --> 1:25:00.080]  tell everybody what she said without saying it she said blank you f you f you and i said whoopee
[1:25:00.080 --> 1:25:06.480]  did you just say f you i mean i was as she was right here and then she said get the f out of
[1:25:06.480 --> 1:25:14.160]  this building and she yelled at me again get the f out of this building and i i felt like i was less
[1:25:14.160 --> 1:25:20.960]  than dirt i couldn't believe that i went there to have a conversation i got thrown off the set
[1:25:20.960 --> 1:25:27.600]  thrown out of the building and as i walked away she's yelling at me get the f out of this building
[1:25:28.160 --> 1:25:37.440]  sean it's sad what these people have turned into is sad what is happening it really is
[1:25:37.440 --> 1:25:42.080]  and it's trump derangement syndrome that leads people like whoopee golberg to lose her mind
[1:25:42.080 --> 1:25:50.480]  one that leads massed leftists in california to fling feces at an immigrant's cafe
[1:25:51.840 --> 1:25:57.840]  an immigrant opens a cafe in los angeles massed leftists show up and fling feces at it
[1:25:58.960 --> 1:26:07.520]  you have them burning a flag at a maxine waters rally you have a non-binary green-haired
[1:26:07.520 --> 1:26:19.040]  Trump hating liberal in seattle rip a 17 year old's MAGA hat off spit on it throw it to the ground
[1:26:19.040 --> 1:26:26.320]  and then tell him he's not welcome here get the f out of this city so this is the deranged left

[1:33:40.640 --> 1:33:46.160]  chuck schumer tweets this out until we know what happened at that two hour meeting in
[1:33:46.160 --> 1:33:52.240]  helsinki donald trump should have no more one-on-one interactions with putin in the united states
[1:33:52.240 --> 1:34:00.480]  in russia or anywhere else well i got news for you dirtbag you're not the boss in fact you're not
[1:34:00.480 --> 1:34:10.720]  even in the majority in congress so you have no say in this but what's the story behind the story
[1:34:11.440 --> 1:34:17.760]  which is that chuck schumer says that he declares that trump and putin should not meet one-on-one
[1:34:17.760 --> 1:34:24.560]  as if chuck schumer is in charge no chuck no sorry donald trump's the president you're the
[1:34:24.560 --> 1:34:29.120]  leader of the minority losing party that's going down you're killing your own party so
[1:34:29.840 --> 1:34:36.240]  what the story behind the story here is that the deep state and the corrupt democrats are truly
[1:34:36.800 --> 1:34:42.480]  panicked over private conversations between trump and putin you have to really think about that
[1:34:42.480 --> 1:34:48.960]  chuck schumer honestly he's so freaked out by whatever it is that donald trump has on him
[1:34:48.960 --> 1:34:53.680]  he needs to know everything trump is saying with putin he has to know because he's that scared
[1:34:53.680 --> 1:34:57.840]  of his own criminal activity being exposed ladies and gentlemen that's what this is why
[1:34:57.840 --> 1:35:04.800]  else does chuck schumer have to have an ear in the putin trump summit why does chuck schumer have
[1:35:04.800 --> 1:35:12.640]  to have an ear when putin and trump are talking because he's scared to death about what they
[1:35:12.640 --> 1:35:17.920]  might be talking about folks that's what this is chuck schumer you're not a dictator you're not
[1:35:17.920 --> 1:35:23.600]  an autocrat you have no say over this you're a dirtbag democrat who's scared to death that two
[1:35:23.600 --> 1:35:28.960]  alpha males are actually teaming up to make the world great again and to make america great again
[1:35:28.960 --> 1:35:34.320]  and to make russia great again and you can't stand it and you're scared senseless because you don't
[1:35:34.320 --> 1:35:39.680]  control trump he's not in your secret shadow government and so you're scared you know whatless
[1:35:40.560 --> 1:35:45.760]  and you want to know everything trump does all the time because he has you that scared chuck schumer
[1:35:45.760 --> 1:35:54.320]  so lee stranhan is my guest citizenjournalismschool.com populist.tv uh lee before i get into some of the
[1:35:54.320 --> 1:35:59.680]  news with bill broder and with the um kind of developments in the screeple case if you want
[1:35:59.680 --> 1:36:03.280]  to call it that where you were boots on the ground actually when there was a development that
[1:36:03.280 --> 1:36:09.280]  what do you make of chuck schumer demanding that trump never meet one-on-one with putin without
[1:36:09.280 --> 1:36:12.720]  him knowing everything that said what do you make of chuck schumer claiming that
[1:36:13.600 --> 1:36:21.600]  well you nailed it oh and i mean it is it is fear but i gotta say it goes beyond schumer and guys
[1:36:21.600 --> 1:36:27.520]  like john mccain are every bit is afraid of chuck schumer it really doesn't matter at the end of the
[1:36:27.520 --> 1:36:33.920]  day whether you get an e or an r after your name um with some with some of these people i mean you
[1:36:33.920 --> 1:36:42.080]  know that about the only person i think acting sanely right now is and it's no shock is rand paul
[1:36:44.240 --> 1:36:52.640]  nearly every other senator i've seen and let's just talk about the senators is has just lost it
[1:36:52.640 --> 1:36:58.640]  completely and it really is incredible to see this happening to our congress honestly i mean
[1:36:58.640 --> 1:37:02.720]  that's what you'd have americans worried not what trump and putin are doing it's what our own
[1:37:02.720 --> 1:37:07.840]  congressmen are doing like eric swalwell it's really incredible stuff but lee let's talk about
[1:37:07.840 --> 1:37:13.280]  bill broder now bill broder is a name that the average american has never heard of in fact even
[1:37:13.280 --> 1:37:17.840]  people who are well informed probably have never heard of bill broder you've reported on bill broder
[1:37:17.840 --> 1:37:23.520]  in the past uh russian media reports on bill broder all the time but this is a guy who's always kind
[1:37:23.520 --> 1:37:28.960]  of stayed behind the shadows as far as american media is concerned but then all the sudden last
[1:37:28.960 --> 1:37:33.360]  week and still up to today he's doing it this week too so the last two weeks bill broder
[1:37:33.360 --> 1:37:38.800]  is doing multiple television interviews every day he's all over tv all over the media he's going
[1:37:38.800 --> 1:37:44.960]  everywhere telling everyone how bad trump and putin is why bill broder was unheard of until
[1:37:44.960 --> 1:37:50.720]  recently and then what happens putin mentions broder's name at the summit and then it all clicks
[1:37:50.720 --> 1:37:56.480]  so bill broder is feeling the heat he's already wanted in russia why is bill broder a name that
[1:37:56.480 --> 1:38:05.680]  americans need to know well bill broder is the guy behind what i would call the russophobia the
[1:38:05.680 --> 1:38:13.600]  anti-russian sentiment and it's ironic because first off bill broder's uh bill broder's grandfather
[1:38:13.600 --> 1:38:22.800]  was earl broder the communist who was a spy for stalin and it's it this is when i say he was the
[1:38:22.800 --> 1:38:28.160]  communist i mean he was literally the leader of the communist party in the united states
[1:38:28.720 --> 1:38:37.440]  he ran for president a couple of times uh as a communist and uh lived lived in russia and as i
[1:38:37.440 --> 1:38:44.800]  say not only spy for stalin but recruited spies for stalin this came out in books uh after letters
[1:38:44.800 --> 1:38:52.800]  came out from inside the stalin regime in russia and that was confirmed so bill broder's that's
[1:38:52.800 --> 1:38:59.920]  his grandfather earl broder his father felix broder famous a genius mathematician uh who
[1:38:59.920 --> 1:39:06.320]  was at princeton for a long time got hired um in part with the help of elena roosevelt
[1:39:06.320 --> 1:39:14.560]  interestingly then bill broder became the biggest venture capitalist or vulture capitalist in russia
[1:39:14.560 --> 1:39:21.120]  in the 1990s after the fall of the soviet union you gotta remember so you know communist russia falls
[1:39:21.840 --> 1:39:27.360]  and they have all these assets like the oil company and the gas company and everything else
[1:39:27.360 --> 1:39:34.000]  that was held by the state bill broder's the guy you know most of us saw the fall of communism
[1:39:34.000 --> 1:39:39.760]  as an opportunity for freedom right but some people saw as an opportunity to make money
[1:39:40.480 --> 1:39:47.440]  and broder's a guy who made millions and billions of dollars built over four billion dollars uh for
[1:39:47.440 --> 1:39:54.720]  his clients uh by going in and what they would do is they would buy up these vouchers that russian
[1:39:54.720 --> 1:40:00.720]  citizens were given and the russian citizens didn't know what the value of the vouchers were
[1:40:00.720 --> 1:40:05.680]  so they would buy them for pennies on the dollar then they had these secret options
[1:40:06.480 --> 1:40:11.280]  and so companies were being bought up literally you know a company valued at
[1:40:11.280 --> 1:40:16.640]  ten million dollars could be bought for like six thousand dollars or something's
[1:40:16.640 --> 1:40:21.040]  in some cases this was literally happening and broder's the guy who made a ton of money
[1:40:21.760 --> 1:40:27.280]  and so just just just real quick in layman's terms bill broder's going around screwing the russian
[1:40:27.280 --> 1:40:31.920]  people making hundreds of millions of dollars then he ends up screwing the russian government
[1:40:31.920 --> 1:40:38.000]  because he doesn't pay his taxes but it's not just he doesn't pay his taxes he engages in schemes
[1:40:38.000 --> 1:40:45.680]  to avoid taxes first off he is not born and born in the united states he renounced his us citizenship
[1:40:45.680 --> 1:40:54.000]  now i you know you and i don't like taxes but if you're thought about renouncing your citizenship
[1:40:54.000 --> 1:41:01.280]  to avoid paying taxes it doesn't occur to us right and this is a guy who literally renounced
[1:41:01.280 --> 1:41:10.240]  he is no longer a us citizen but he actually has been in the media for some time but he flies
[1:41:10.240 --> 1:41:16.640]  under the radar because he just goes up you you have never seen him ask a difficult question
[1:41:16.640 --> 1:41:24.000]  him once ever he testified in front of we're going on one year ago uh almost to the day
[1:41:24.000 --> 1:41:30.320]  he testified in front of congress in front of the senate and every single senator and i mean
[1:41:30.320 --> 1:41:37.600]  people from diane feinstein to people like chuck rassley every one of them just deferred to this
[1:41:37.600 --> 1:41:44.560]  guy no one brought up the fact that he renounced his us citizenship uh that that his his grandfather
[1:41:44.560 --> 1:41:50.240]  was a spy for stalin no one brought anything up negative at all but the most important thing
[1:41:50.240 --> 1:41:57.120]  isn't even that the most important thing is his entire story is a lie uh about the what's called
[1:41:57.120 --> 1:42:04.560]  the magnitsky act this is a log he got passed in 2012 now first off i don't understand how
[1:42:04.560 --> 1:42:10.800]  somebody who's renounced his citizenship has so much political clout oh wait i do it's about
[1:42:10.800 --> 1:42:19.360]  400 000 dollars in illegal campaign contributions that putin accused him of uh he putin misspoke
[1:42:19.360 --> 1:42:27.440]  and said uh 400 million he meant 400 000 and he's corrected that since then but 400 000 in in campaign
[1:42:27.440 --> 1:42:34.800]  contributions this guy was a big democrat donor but he's smart he knows how the media works and he
[1:42:34.800 --> 1:42:41.920]  knows if he goes after donald trump directly and personally he's gonna get hammered by trump all
[1:42:41.920 --> 1:42:45.840]  right let's let's let's come back let's come back on the other side of this break and get in that
[1:42:45.840 --> 1:42:52.880]  because again i mean i monitor news media all day long bill browder is doing like five tv interviews
[1:42:52.880 --> 1:43:01.680]  a day now he went from zero to five why patrick in the great nation of australia you're on the

[1:43:51.360 --> 1:44:01.760]  listeners out there 1776 world war anyone who studied history and knows how human systems work
[1:44:02.320 --> 1:44:09.200]  is horrified we have global hardcore anti-human psychopaths in control the big corporations
[1:44:09.200 --> 1:44:15.200]  they're trying to wreck free market and consolidate total control dumb humanity down ahead of replacing
[1:44:15.200 --> 1:44:19.920]  us with machines and trump has come in and is resisting that and saying we have a human future
[1:44:19.920 --> 1:44:25.280]  they are launching a civil war against nation states right now collapsing our borders and my only

[1:47:17.600 --> 1:47:24.480]  your host oren shroyer so we're joined by leigh stranahan here from citizen journalism school
[1:47:24.480 --> 1:47:31.520]  dot com he's actually in budapest hungry right now working on some george soros related news but
[1:47:31.520 --> 1:47:36.240]  we'll just let that sit out there while he works on that because i want to get into a couple things
[1:47:36.240 --> 1:47:43.520]  here with leigh stranahan first i want him to explain in detail his expertise and knowledge
[1:47:43.520 --> 1:47:48.720]  on the magnitsky act and the fake news that's out there about that so he's going to break that down
[1:47:49.520 --> 1:47:53.440]  then i want to ask him why he thinks broder is going so public
[1:47:53.440 --> 1:47:59.360]  on national media lately when he used to be non-existent there but first uh leigh stranahan
[1:47:59.360 --> 1:48:04.640]  explain to my audience exactly the the the history of the magnitsky act what it is
[1:48:04.640 --> 1:48:09.600]  how bill broder's involved and the fake news out there about it now here's a big thing about this
[1:48:09.600 --> 1:48:16.560]  oren people need to research this themselves and we actually put together a page that people can go
[1:48:16.560 --> 1:48:27.440]  to on populace dot tv of of resources that are firsthand you cannot trust any media on this right
[1:48:27.440 --> 1:48:34.480]  now in fact i got to say oren one of the only sources that have has let me talk about broder
[1:48:34.480 --> 1:48:41.200]  has been info wars for the past uh close to a year now this is literally one of the only outlets
[1:48:41.200 --> 1:48:47.280]  that let's do it this resource page if you just type in bill broder resources you'll find it on
[1:48:47.280 --> 1:48:56.480]  populace dot tv this is testimony from bill broder himself in his own words including a sworn
[1:48:56.480 --> 1:49:02.880]  deposition he gave now what is the magnitsky act a magnitsky act is named after a guy named sir gay
[1:49:02.880 --> 1:49:11.440]  magnitsky if you listen to bill broder in his senate testimony he'll tell you that bill broder was
[1:49:12.080 --> 1:49:19.440]  making all this money in russia then in 2005 he was not allowed back in the country in 2007 his
[1:49:19.440 --> 1:49:27.520]  office was raided and then he says in sworn senate testimony that's when i hired the smartest
[1:49:27.520 --> 1:49:34.000]  russian lawyer i knew sir gay magnitsky to investigate okay let's stop right there that's
[1:49:34.000 --> 1:49:43.840]  a lie in his sworn deposition from 2015 and i have six hours of video so you can watch
[1:49:43.840 --> 1:49:51.840]  broder say it he admits that sir gay magnitsky a was not a lawyer never went to law school never
[1:49:51.840 --> 1:49:59.840]  had a law degree but also that he was working with broder in 2002 now why doesn't broder
[1:49:59.840 --> 1:50:09.040]  say that why does he say this happened in 2007 that's because in 2002 magnitsky who was an accountant
[1:50:09.040 --> 1:50:15.840]  not a lawyer was working on these tax avoidance schemes where they would do things like in a
[1:50:15.840 --> 1:50:23.520]  region of russia called kelmikia he would claim that he had veterans working for him to get a
[1:50:23.520 --> 1:50:30.480]  tax break but there were no veterans working for him that the veterans never worked today they were
[1:50:30.480 --> 1:50:38.000]  just hired on paper to get a big tax break you know millions of dollars in tax break and he says
[1:50:38.000 --> 1:50:45.760]  all of this stuff so anyway magnitsky eventually gets arrested he dies in russian prison of health
[1:50:45.760 --> 1:50:53.040]  related problems well a heart attack and by the way broder has something to do with that too but
[1:50:53.040 --> 1:50:58.720]  that's another story broder was urging him write complaint letters broder was scared to death when
[1:50:58.720 --> 1:51:06.160]  magnitsky was in prison so then what happens is after magnitsky dies but only after he dies
[1:51:06.160 --> 1:51:13.040]  broder starts making magnitsky a martyr right now here's the thing about the magnitsky act
[1:51:13.040 --> 1:51:19.360]  the way broder pitches it is it's a human rights law that holds people accountable
[1:51:19.360 --> 1:51:25.040]  for human rights violations but let's just think about this from sort of a libertarian perspective
[1:51:25.040 --> 1:51:33.120]  a a a a a rights perspective if you look at the magnitsky act which was promoted by john mccain
[1:51:33.120 --> 1:51:38.160]  there's a video of him up on youtube talking about it here's what it does oh and think about this
[1:51:38.160 --> 1:51:46.480]  imagine oh and if a foreign government could seize your bank account and not let you travel but
[1:51:46.480 --> 1:51:52.240]  imagine if russia did this to you right or any country great in any country they said oh and
[1:51:52.240 --> 1:51:59.120]  we're going to seize your bank account and where you can't travel here and you'd be like well well
[1:51:59.120 --> 1:52:06.640]  why are you doing that and you say well you're on a list now this is not like the un or this is not
[1:52:06.640 --> 1:52:15.200]  like uh some human rights commission literally the magnitsky act list was people that bill broder
[1:52:15.200 --> 1:52:23.040]  picked literally there was no commission that found them guilty of anything they're not even it's
[1:52:23.040 --> 1:52:31.440]  not even Putin it's not even top people in russia bill broder put on the magnitsky act the police
[1:52:31.440 --> 1:52:38.640]  who were investigating his tax crimes now why do you think he doesn't want them to come to america
[1:52:38.640 --> 1:52:44.800]  because if they came to america they testified as to what he was actually doing all right so let
[1:52:44.800 --> 1:52:50.640]  me try to crunch this out let me try to crunch this out so it's amazing bill broder uses a fake
[1:52:50.640 --> 1:52:57.760]  lawyer magnitsky to try to get this act passed through the 112th congress that they claim is to
[1:52:57.760 --> 1:53:03.280]  stop human rights violations but the meat of it is really to stop or for them to be in control
[1:53:03.280 --> 1:53:08.160]  of travel between the united states and russia so that broder can't have a fair investigation on
[1:53:08.160 --> 1:53:13.360]  all the money laundering he's been doing am i am i accurately projecting this that's exactly right
[1:53:13.360 --> 1:53:18.640]  so for instance literally on that magnitsky act list are a couple of russian police officers
[1:53:19.440 --> 1:53:26.720]  who were investigating broder now these are police officers who were not even accused of any crime in
[1:53:26.720 --> 1:53:31.920]  russia does that make sense in other words well i think you know i i think the most ridiculous
[1:53:31.920 --> 1:53:37.120]  part of this honestly li is that you're talking about bill broder a non-citizen at the time
[1:53:37.120 --> 1:53:42.800]  working with magnitsky a non-lawyer at the time and having people like mccain to get this stuff
[1:53:42.800 --> 1:53:48.880]  passed it has no right no reason ever to even come to congress and yet here's the thing about it i
[1:53:48.880 --> 1:53:56.880]  know and not one said that not one congressman not one senator has ever asked you know when you see
[1:53:56.880 --> 1:54:04.400]  broder in the media you will never see him ask a tough question and the reason why is that if he
[1:54:04.400 --> 1:54:11.120]  gets asked a tough question he gets up and he walks out in fact he's had article after article
[1:54:11.120 --> 1:54:18.400]  censored there's a guy named alex craner he wrote a book about broder it was removed from amazon
[1:54:18.400 --> 1:54:26.400]  now this gets deeper over the guy who removed the book from amazon was a lawyer named jonathan
[1:54:26.400 --> 1:54:35.120]  weiner weiner is intimately connected to this deal dossier weiner is a top john carrie aid
[1:54:35.120 --> 1:54:40.880]  it's it's w i n e r jonathan weiner looks like does he have a connection to fusion gps or perkins
[1:54:40.880 --> 1:54:49.120]  coey no here's the thing about fusion gps is weird glenn simpson who we know worked in the
[1:54:49.120 --> 1:54:57.360]  steel dossier also worked against broder and broder uses and so this is interesting so you
[1:54:57.360 --> 1:55:04.080]  don't forget who glenn simpson is he's he's a hired gun does that make sense yeah he's the fusion gps
[1:55:04.080 --> 1:55:11.440]  uh essentially private eye for lack of a better term he's a fusion gps uh hacker private eye getting
[1:55:11.440 --> 1:55:20.000]  the details yeah but but when he was working against broder he was doing good stuff he didn't
[1:55:20.000 --> 1:55:25.920]  he didn't minor stuff against broder uh they were trying to serve broder to subpoena him
[1:55:26.560 --> 1:55:31.440]  well i think in fairness to simpson and and i think even the the steel dossier case he seems
[1:55:31.440 --> 1:55:35.600]  to be at least cooperating to some extent in fairness to simpson he just takes whatever business
[1:55:35.600 --> 1:55:40.800]  comes across his desk it seems like that's exactly right and do you know who's helped really demonet
[1:55:40.800 --> 1:55:48.080]  and this is what broder's done he's very smart to people on the right he demonizes glenn simpson
[1:55:48.080 --> 1:55:54.240]  but bill broder is connected to that steel dossier too don't forget he's no longer u.s citizen
[1:55:54.240 --> 1:56:00.480]  where is he's citizen great britain right his i was just in london investigating bill broder
[1:56:00.480 --> 1:56:05.760]  as well as the salisbury thing yeah where we're at this where you've got another weird poisoning
[1:56:05.760 --> 1:56:08.960]  incident they're trying to link back to putin when it's actually evidence it wasn't putin but
[1:56:08.960 --> 1:56:13.280]  that's another story that's another story and it's amazing and when i get back to the states
[1:56:13.280 --> 1:56:18.800]  i got big stuff coming on that but bill broder's office in london is about an eight-minute drive
[1:56:19.360 --> 1:56:25.840]  from the steel dossier or bus but the company that did that work christopher steels company
[1:56:25.840 --> 1:56:32.320]  it's right there they're both in central london so it's like a it's like a it's like a uh a london
[1:56:32.320 --> 1:56:37.280]  version of what david brock is doing with media matters where they're all centrally located pretending
[1:56:37.280 --> 1:56:43.520]  they're not working together and here's the thing johnathan weiner is the guy who brought
[1:56:43.520 --> 1:56:51.040]  the steel dossier behind the scenes to john carrey and this is bill broder's top guy in
[1:56:51.040 --> 1:56:57.760]  washington dc and has been for over a decade okay okay okay now see if you can stick around for
[1:56:57.760 --> 1:57:02.640]  five more minutes now see this is actually interesting because my next question was going to be
[1:57:03.600 --> 1:57:08.320]  why do you think bill broder is all of a sudden doing all these media appearances and you just
[1:57:08.320 --> 1:57:13.840]  answered it because his fingertips are his fingerprints are all over that steel dossier
[1:57:13.840 --> 1:57:17.920]  which is about to blow up in the democrats hands and they're going to be looking for
[1:57:17.920 --> 1:57:23.120]  someone to blame they're going to be looking for someone to cast the blame on for this
[1:57:23.120 --> 1:57:29.120]  and bill broder is the perfect one to blame because he's not a u.s citizen and he can stay over
[1:57:29.120 --> 1:57:33.840]  there in great britain and and and have russia hate him the united states hate him but he's the
[1:57:33.840 --> 1:57:38.080]  perfect scapegoat i think that may be the answer but let's get least ryan hands take on the other

[2:00:13.680 --> 2:00:19.280]  host olyn shroyer all right we've got five more minutes here with lee stranahan from citizen
[2:00:19.280 --> 2:00:26.320]  journalism school dot com and populist tv dot com uh lee i want you to respond to the last segment
[2:00:26.320 --> 2:00:32.480]  the conclusion there it seems to me that the reason why bill broder is now doing five television
[2:00:32.480 --> 2:00:38.960]  interviews a day from zero is because he's panicked right now that whatever involvement he had
[2:00:39.840 --> 2:00:43.680]  with this steel dossier the fake russian collusion dossier that's blowing up in the
[2:00:43.680 --> 2:00:49.040]  democrats hands he's worried that this is gonna end up scapegoating him because he's the perfect
[2:00:49.040 --> 2:00:54.480]  scapegoat why do you think bill broder is going on media uh five times a day all of a sudden well
[2:00:54.480 --> 2:01:02.160]  broder's motivation is really easy to understand he's been convicted of these tax crimes in russia
[2:01:02.160 --> 2:01:08.960]  he's convicted uh period and when you when you look at these again here's the thing about
[2:01:08.960 --> 2:01:15.600]  those two things number one he's connected to so many top anti-trump people well let me give you
[2:01:15.600 --> 2:01:21.440]  one example i'll give you i'll give you a couple but here's one he went and filed a lawsuit he
[2:01:21.440 --> 2:01:28.560]  you know forgive me he got the state of new york to file criminal charges in a case called the
[2:01:28.560 --> 2:01:34.480]  previs on case that's what that russian lawyer natalia vessel nitskaya was working on broder
[2:01:34.480 --> 2:01:41.440]  went to preach bahara now you remember when donald trump like every president fired all the u.s
[2:01:41.440 --> 2:01:48.480]  attorneys remember that and it was a big controversy but it's a non-controversy because every president
[2:01:48.480 --> 2:01:51.360]  well actually didn't he didn't didn't he actually fired the least amount
[2:01:51.360 --> 2:02:00.880]  yeah he he he did i mean but but one of the guy who complained the most was this guy in new york
[2:02:00.880 --> 2:02:07.120]  pre-bahara who hates trump well bill broder is close friends with pre-bahara bill broders appeared
[2:02:07.120 --> 2:02:13.840]  on bahara's podcast subsequently they've done appearances together now the reason he he filed
[2:02:13.840 --> 2:02:22.080]  that suit was he's trying to drum up this fake controversy over the magnitsky act so he files
[2:02:22.080 --> 2:02:28.560]  that they try to subpoena broder because he's the one who got the uh criminal charges brought
[2:02:29.680 --> 2:02:36.320]  so bill broder who does media appearances in in the states all the time on comedy central places
[2:02:36.320 --> 2:02:43.920]  like that he ducks a subpoena in fact there's a video on uh of bill broder literally in new york
[2:02:43.920 --> 2:02:51.440]  city running through a limo as they're trying to serve in papers and running through through the
[2:02:51.440 --> 2:02:56.160]  streets it's the most amazing thing let's see if we can find that video let's see but but but but
[2:02:56.160 --> 2:03:02.160]  leave but hold on i'm telling you lee i'm i'm lee i'm telling you i monitor television news and tv
[2:03:02.160 --> 2:03:08.960]  like a hound and and broder has gone from an occasional he's all over he's all over every
[2:03:08.960 --> 2:03:16.720]  day non-stop he's clearly pennant well especially where's he been fox news this past week and here's
[2:03:16.720 --> 2:03:24.480]  why if people on the right figure out which is the fox audience right if people on the right figure
[2:03:24.480 --> 2:03:33.440]  out that bill broder who he is and what he's been up to it's over for him he needs to stay out of
[2:03:33.440 --> 2:03:40.880]  prison that's his only goal and so what he does is he goes on outlets that never ask him if you go
[2:03:40.880 --> 2:03:46.560]  to youtube and just type in bill broder interview you'll find dozens and dozens of interviews
[2:03:46.560 --> 2:03:54.320]  you won't find one of them to say now bill you you said in sworn testimony let's roll the video
[2:03:54.320 --> 2:04:00.160]  tape that sir game magnitsky is not a lawyer why did you say that when you keep saying he's a lawyer
[2:04:00.160 --> 2:04:07.520]  you'll never find that never ever ever ever not one interview you know why because bill
[2:04:07.520 --> 2:04:14.000]  broder goes on on western media outlets that don't even have a spine instead of going on russian
[2:04:14.000 --> 2:04:17.440]  media outlets that would actually call him out for this leash ran hand thank you so much for
[2:04:17.440 --> 2:04:21.280]  joining us today thank you for your breakdown i wish we could talk more about your experience in
[2:04:21.280 --> 2:04:26.240]  london with the screeple poisoning case and the new ripples that have come from that once again
[2:04:26.240 --> 2:04:30.560]  looks like a fake news story against putin but we'll just have to wait for you to return to the
[2:04:30.560 --> 2:04:34.000]  states and break that report so leash ran hand thank you so much for joining us today
[2:04:36.320 --> 2:04:42.560]  all right there goes leash ran hand citizenjournalismschool.com populisttv.com on the other side
[2:04:42.560 --> 2:04:47.920]  of this break we're going to be joined by martina marcota she was in london during the trump protest
[2:04:47.920 --> 2:04:52.960]  and if you saw the footage she got it's it's quite shocking these creatures are are really disturbing
[2:04:56.800 --> 2:05:03.920]  anyone who's studied history and knows how human systems work is horrified we have global
[2:05:03.920 --> 2:05:09.840]  hardcore anti-human psychopaths in control the big corporations they're trying to wreck free market
[2:05:09.840 --> 2:05:14.800]  and consolidate total control dumb humanity down ahead of replacing us with machines
[2:05:14.800 --> 2:05:18.640]  and trump has come in and is resisting that and saying we have a human future
[2:05:19.280 --> 2:05:23.520]  they are launching a civil war against nation states right now collapsing our borders
[2:05:23.520 --> 2:05:29.440]  and my only message is this everybody better wake up and realize the fight is now everybody should
[2:05:29.440 --> 2:05:33.680]  be very very urgent because the left and the globalists are frantic and launching their
[2:05:33.680 --> 2:05:39.120]  anti-human plan because they crave to control people those of us that are pro-human don't
[2:05:39.120 --> 2:05:44.080]  crave power we already have the power but we have to realize these scum are coming after us and we
[2:05:44.080 --> 2:05:50.720]  have to speak out and take action now info wars is on the front line and so are you we are the resistance
[2:06:00.720 --> 2:06:08.800]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[2:06:08.800 --> 2:06:16.160]  and now your host owin treuer you know this is an incredible story here that i'm not really
[2:06:16.160 --> 2:06:21.920]  going to be able to get to but and i can't even the the crew just found this so i asked them to
[2:06:21.920 --> 2:06:28.560]  find this story on mother jones written by michael isaacov and david corn two two totally
[2:06:28.560 --> 2:06:34.400]  stuge journalists fake journalists that are nothing more than a mouthpiece and a and a pen for the
[2:06:34.400 --> 2:06:41.280]  democrat left in america they write this story on march 9th 2018 the secret story of obama's
[2:06:41.280 --> 2:06:45.440]  response to putin's attack on the 2016 election now again you have to understand michael isaacov
[2:06:45.440 --> 2:06:50.480]  is a a leftist puppet he spiked the monica lawinsky story for yahoo news when they could have
[2:06:50.480 --> 2:06:58.640]  broke it uh david corn who runs mother jones is a total leftist he hates info wars he lies about us
[2:06:58.640 --> 2:07:02.560]  they write this story on march 9th of last year talking about and apparently they've written 12
[2:07:02.560 --> 2:07:10.640]  books about how obama knew of putin and the russians trying to hack into the election now they go in
[2:07:10.640 --> 2:07:16.000]  here they you know john brennan is mentioning here they act like oh there's a bunch of hubba
[2:07:16.000 --> 2:07:22.080]  below about russian interference but they did nothing they did nothing and this is the mouthpiece
[2:07:22.080 --> 2:07:27.440]  of the left admitting it and then the crew found this story from the same day march 9th 2018
[2:07:27.440 --> 2:07:33.680]  on business insider susan reiss reportedly told the white house cyber team to knock it off when
[2:07:33.680 --> 2:07:39.840]  they floated options to combat russian meddling maybe this is the hot mic moment between obama
[2:07:39.840 --> 2:07:46.240]  and medved i i i maybe he's mispronouncing his name where he says oh just wait till i get
[2:07:46.240 --> 2:07:50.480]  reelected then we'll be more flexible and we can do things is that obama saying we're gonna let you
[2:07:50.480 --> 2:07:55.200]  meddle in our elections is that what this is they stood down multiple times we have the hot mic
[2:07:55.200 --> 2:07:59.760]  there's more evidence for obama meddling and colluding with russia than trump and even the left
[2:07:59.760 --> 2:08:08.800]  admits it it's incredible and here we are i'm now joined by martina marcota you can find her on
[2:08:08.800 --> 2:08:15.360]  twitter at martina marcota.com she is the unofficial leader of the goth right she was in london during
[2:08:15.360 --> 2:08:20.880]  the trump protest they had a big trump baby out there and really just a bunch of creatures showed
[2:08:20.880 --> 2:08:25.920]  up martina so you know you've been to some trump uh trump protests in the united states you've seen
[2:08:25.920 --> 2:08:30.320]  some of the people that show up for that it's it's a lot of deranged lunatic type of people but
[2:08:30.320 --> 2:08:34.880]  what we saw in london was like a totally different story talk about the creatures
[2:08:34.880 --> 2:08:40.960]  that you saw coming out to protest trump in london the creatures that that's pretty accurate yeah
[2:08:40.960 --> 2:08:48.000]  and i mean just to be clear that baby trump balloon was not as big as they really wanted it to be it
[2:08:48.000 --> 2:08:53.200]  was quite pathetic actually so it was not impressive at all but i mean yeah i mean i expected these
[2:08:53.200 --> 2:09:00.240]  types of people trans drag queens people showing up they they called it a carnival i think that's
[2:09:00.240 --> 2:09:06.720]  what they actually said about it and they seem to really really think that britain unanimously
[2:09:07.280 --> 2:09:13.520]  does not want to accept trump but um that's actually not true there was definitely plenty of
[2:09:13.520 --> 2:09:20.560]  trump supporters that i know of and that i've met in england and um they just are a loud minority you
[2:09:20.560 --> 2:09:27.840]  know what i mean but these people understand that trump is the president of the united states right
[2:09:27.840 --> 2:09:36.080]  do they understand that or do they not um yeah i i don't know exactly what they wanted i mean i
[2:09:36.080 --> 2:09:40.400]  asked them what why are they there what are they doing what are they trying to do and it was just
[2:09:40.400 --> 2:09:46.640]  uh we just want to show him that he's not welcome here and i mean it doesn't really matter what you
[2:09:46.640 --> 2:09:53.280]  think i mean he is the president of the united states and um i just thought it was really interesting
[2:09:53.280 --> 2:10:00.080]  that they didn't want to have a relationship with america the the trade agreement they thought that
[2:10:00.080 --> 2:10:06.160]  you know our alliance should not be uh there anymore as long as trump is president they just
[2:10:06.160 --> 2:10:13.920]  think that he's going to bring more um right wing policies to england and um i mean it's just incredible
[2:10:13.920 --> 2:10:18.240]  it's a very obvious what the type of stuff they say you know he's a racist in this and that well
[2:10:18.240 --> 2:10:23.840]  it's all the typical things you hear in america but they really wanted to show up in carnival
[2:10:23.840 --> 2:10:30.800]  like fashion and uh you know that's that's what they do they're pretty weird well i mean i
[2:10:31.360 --> 2:10:35.040]  not trying to i mean it is it is funny i mean these you know it is how can you not laugh at
[2:10:35.040 --> 2:10:41.760]  these people it's such a clown show but on a serious note here i mean i mean really it's just
[2:10:41.760 --> 2:10:46.480]  like the guy and i don't know if you've seen this story there was a green haired quote unquote
[2:10:46.480 --> 2:10:52.400]  non-binary that assaulted a high school student that took his MAGA hat spit on it told him he's
[2:10:52.400 --> 2:10:58.160]  not welcome here get the f out of my city on a real note on a real serious note here when you
[2:10:58.160 --> 2:11:05.760]  talk about social engineering that guy right there that guy right there or i'm sorry that g whatever
[2:11:05.760 --> 2:11:11.440]  they want to be called and then all those people that that showed up to these london protests i'm
[2:11:11.440 --> 2:11:16.720]  i'm like this is not this is a serious problem for mankind that is the last stage of humanity
[2:11:16.720 --> 2:11:23.200]  before we die out like that is the last stage of humans before we go instinct right there that is
[2:11:23.200 --> 2:11:30.000]  the death of humanity that's what these people represent yeah i mean absolutely it's just the
[2:11:30.000 --> 2:11:33.840]  bottom of the bottom did you see that photo that was spreading around i mean with the leg
[2:11:33.840 --> 2:11:38.960]  spread open and all that they just they have no shame and you know quite honestly i am used to
[2:11:38.960 --> 2:11:43.120]  seeing this type of stuff in new york you know i'm from new york so london and new york have this
[2:11:43.120 --> 2:11:49.520]  parallel and so it was quite like an alternate reality to be there and everyone just had funny
[2:11:49.520 --> 2:11:54.160]  accents but it was the same rhetoric it's the same thing it really shows you that they're really
[2:11:54.160 --> 2:12:00.080]  watching the same type of stuff the media is all saying the same type of thing and they're regurgitating
[2:12:00.080 --> 2:12:05.040]  the same thing that they say in new york there's no difference to it and why don't the people in
[2:12:05.040 --> 2:12:10.880]  london care about their own country and their own leaders like siddie kahn who says terrorism is
[2:12:10.880 --> 2:12:16.240]  part and parcel here they are focusing on trump who's not even involved in their politics really i
[2:12:16.240 --> 2:12:20.800]  mean okay he can have an he can have a conversation with your leaders apparently not i guess but it's
[2:12:20.800 --> 2:12:25.520]  like they don't even realize that their own leaders like siddie kahn are destroying their cities and
[2:12:25.520 --> 2:12:31.440]  they just oh trump bad let's have a trump balloon that's absolutely true i mean siddie kahn is it's
[2:12:31.440 --> 2:12:38.560]  so horrible how he's running that city and i mean he says that what crime is a stabbings are a
[2:12:38.560 --> 2:12:46.720]  parcel of living in a diverse city i mean who says that that's insane no that's totally factually
[2:12:46.720 --> 2:12:52.480]  incorrect i mean you look at houston texas it's the most diverse city in america i mean maybe the
[2:12:52.480 --> 2:12:57.280]  world i really don't know but you don't have a bunch of random stabbings happening every day i mean
[2:12:57.280 --> 2:13:01.920]  sure you're gonna have some violence in a big city but it's not because of multiculturalism it's because
[2:13:01.920 --> 2:13:06.720]  of open borders and and and and not having people coming in that actually want to be a part of that
[2:13:06.720 --> 2:13:10.880]  culture and you know what's interesting is that the met police there that's what they call it the
[2:13:10.880 --> 2:13:18.080]  met police um they are focused they have it in their um in their manuals about diversity training
[2:13:18.640 --> 2:13:25.200]  and how to um you know combat hate crimes and stuff like that this is what they're teaching
[2:13:25.200 --> 2:13:31.600]  their police instead of acknowledging where this crime is coming from and dealing with that um in
[2:13:31.600 --> 2:13:37.840]  a more direct route they're teaching their police about diversity training and how to accept more
[2:13:37.840 --> 2:13:45.600]  you know diverse uh genders and cultures and we they want to make the police equivalent to the
[2:13:45.600 --> 2:13:52.320]  amount of like you know diversity that there is in london they're focused on that and then making
[2:13:52.320 --> 2:13:57.920]  it less white and making it more diverse to reflect the city which is what why is that a priority
[2:13:57.920 --> 2:14:03.680]  for the police that's not crime fighting i guess that's the point i guess that's the point they're
[2:14:03.680 --> 2:14:09.600]  not fighting crime anymore and so so crime runs rampant but i mean so like in the united states
[2:14:09.600 --> 2:14:13.840]  i mean actually and obviously i've had a lot of experiences with cops actually i really don't
[2:14:13.840 --> 2:14:17.600]  understand i feel like the new york police department is like i don't get it i don't know
[2:14:17.600 --> 2:14:21.120]  why they wouldn't arrest the individual that assaulted us they saw it on camera they clearly
[2:14:21.120 --> 2:14:25.280]  let him go maybe they were working with the guy i really don't know he did have stingray equipment
[2:14:25.280 --> 2:14:30.640]  but that's another story my point is though most the cops that i deal with in america are still
[2:14:30.640 --> 2:14:36.400]  like sane and you can tell that they have some protocol not to to to really do anything to these
[2:14:36.400 --> 2:14:41.680]  people did you see that in london or were the police even like kind of with them like oh yeah
[2:14:41.680 --> 2:14:49.840]  we love the freak show you know i didn't really see that much police during the um protest i did
[2:14:49.840 --> 2:14:57.280]  see them around a bar there were some people with maga hats and they were pro trump people and
[2:14:57.280 --> 2:15:03.040]  they were just kind of chanting pro they were waving american flags and british flags it's
[2:15:03.040 --> 2:15:08.960]  the same thing in america where if you see a you know american flag or british flag you know that
[2:15:08.960 --> 2:15:13.280]  they're the patriots because the left don't bring that kind of flag they're carrying the antifa flags
[2:15:13.280 --> 2:15:18.960]  and any other for the eu flag any other sort of flag except the british flag so you knew you saw the
[2:15:18.960 --> 2:15:24.240]  red hats and you saw the flags and there was a barrier of police pretty much just standing around
[2:15:24.240 --> 2:15:30.240]  not doing much i mean i've also seen um with anemarie waters she's uh you know campaigning here in
[2:15:30.240 --> 2:15:35.840]  england and she's really sending the right message and when she was at some hustings that's supposed
[2:15:35.840 --> 2:15:40.960]  to do some sort of debate the police just kind of stood around and didn't really create a barrier
[2:15:40.960 --> 2:15:46.000]  they didn't they didn't push people out of the way to make a safe entryway they kind of just stand
[2:15:46.000 --> 2:15:51.760]  around and let things happen they don't have guns so it's they they really are one more segment
[2:15:51.760 --> 2:15:56.640]  with martina marco on the other side this is the alexio show if you like alkaline water or know

[2:20:12.480 --> 2:20:19.840]  well you know it's weird that the left picks and chooses when it wants to obsess about sex
[2:20:19.840 --> 2:20:26.160]  so it's like if you want to mutilate yourself and destroy your sex the left is into it if you're
[2:20:26.160 --> 2:20:31.280]  bill clinton and you use cigars and you have rape cases settled the left has no interest
[2:20:31.280 --> 2:20:37.040]  if you're barack obama and you refer to your wife michael multiple times the left has no interest in
[2:20:37.040 --> 2:20:44.720]  it but martina marcota is my guest here martina this is going to shock you all right i know this
[2:20:44.720 --> 2:20:51.360]  is going to shock you brace yourself but they're reporting that donald trump may have had sexual
[2:20:51.360 --> 2:20:59.040]  relations with the playboy model shocking i know right shocking i don't know well i mean you know
[2:20:59.040 --> 2:21:05.120]  that's funny because i mean is that even shocking at all because we all knew trump's history i mean
[2:21:05.120 --> 2:21:10.720]  those of us that are old enough know what he was like i mean throughout his whole career this is
[2:21:10.720 --> 2:21:16.080]  totally in line with him and this is who we voted for and you know what i've said this about the
[2:21:16.080 --> 2:21:22.000]  trump tapes that were exposed to access hollywood tapes at least he was talking about an adult woman
[2:21:23.280 --> 2:21:30.000]  nothing wrong with that and again they take these things out of context he's clearly joking again
[2:21:30.000 --> 2:21:35.920]  oh it's inappropriate whatever people this one's sick of people act like they don't talk like this
[2:21:35.920 --> 2:21:39.680]  when they're hanging out with their friends behind closed doors look you know we all say things we
[2:21:39.680 --> 2:21:44.560]  regret we all say stupid things that doesn't mean we're a bad person that doesn't mean that you mean
[2:21:44.560 --> 2:21:51.840]  what you say but it doesn't even matter i just did a video uh just now too about have you heard
[2:21:51.840 --> 2:21:59.040]  about that james gun thing right with the um yeah he talks about he jokes this is sick excuse me i mean
[2:21:59.040 --> 2:22:05.120]  you know muff it if you have a child he jokes and celebrates a monkey masturbating on a child
[2:22:05.120 --> 2:22:10.960]  so i mean the left can joke around and do whatever they want but it's funny how they want to take us
[2:22:10.960 --> 2:22:16.560]  out of context and blow up every little thing and at this protest just the way that they were talking
[2:22:16.560 --> 2:22:24.480]  about trump being this horrible like sexual monster and it's like what about the cigar with
[2:22:24.480 --> 2:22:30.240]  bill clinton what about you know every president having affairs what about all this stuff what about
[2:22:30.240 --> 2:22:35.760]  all this stuff what about james gun and it's just like no one wants to acknowledge anything unless it's
[2:22:35.760 --> 2:22:40.880]  like the right or trump they they take it and they put it in a context and they make they you know
[2:22:40.880 --> 2:22:45.680]  when i worked in the performing industry in new york i worked at this club that did the most
[2:22:45.680 --> 2:22:50.240]  bizarre it was all these people before you got blackballed by the way before they blackballed you
[2:22:50.240 --> 2:22:55.840]  for being a conservative so i mean i was working with all these freaks they would have um acts on
[2:22:55.840 --> 2:23:00.800]  um acts on stage that people would you know do number two on and they would do this whole thing
[2:23:00.800 --> 2:23:06.720]  and spread it around they would dildo on stage that sounds like a leftist protest yeah they would
[2:23:06.720 --> 2:23:11.920]  dildo as nuns on stage and defile christianity they would do all these horrible things and they
[2:23:11.920 --> 2:23:17.440]  would do like rape kind of things and just everything was very to the extreme sexualized
[2:23:17.440 --> 2:23:23.040]  then when the trump tapes came out they acted like they were purge you know purls in church goers like
[2:23:23.040 --> 2:23:28.960]  oh my god oh my gosh i'm just an innocent church mouse donald trump oh my gosh a billionaire
[2:23:28.960 --> 2:23:35.440]  playboy has sex with play playmate models i can't even believe this it's just like blew my mind and
[2:23:35.440 --> 2:23:40.640]  the owner of this club that i worked at he had lawsuits going after him from like 10 years ago
[2:23:40.640 --> 2:23:44.880]  because he would do weird you know jerk off in dressing rooms try to like do weird shits and
[2:23:44.880 --> 2:23:48.880]  girls and there's lawsuits he had to pay tens of thousand dollars and i'm like look at who you
[2:23:48.880 --> 2:23:55.600]  work for and you have a problem with trump really okay fine well and i just want to say this the
[2:23:55.600 --> 2:24:00.160]  footage that that you captured when you were out there in london i mean again that's the kind of
[2:24:00.160 --> 2:24:06.800]  sexual depravity that they celebrate is just being as weird and out there as possible uh you know
[2:24:06.800 --> 2:24:12.320]  but normal sexual activity that you would expect between donald trump and a playbay model is somehow
[2:24:12.320 --> 2:24:17.760]  like status that they need to be complaining and and raise a big fuss over it so it's really just
[2:24:17.760 --> 2:24:22.400]  ridiculous how dare he be a straight male how dare he that's what it is that's what it is martina

[2:25:32.560 --> 2:25:40.000]  gremlin that's now gone completely uh viral it's up on info wars dot com so that's coming up i just
[2:25:40.000 --> 2:25:46.240]  wanted to point people in the direction of a story on info wars dot com it's really important
[2:25:46.880 --> 2:25:51.360]  and that's when i so many times when i'm on the air don't look at info wars dot com or news wars
[2:25:51.360 --> 2:25:55.280]  dot com and then later i get off the air and i'm like oh my gosh look at these incredible stories
[2:25:55.280 --> 2:26:00.720]  that got no attention so we're going to cover that in just a moment but first here's where i stand on
[2:26:00.720 --> 2:26:08.320]  trump and the two um women we know of one on the playboy playmate he said he treated her very nice
[2:26:08.320 --> 2:26:12.080]  it was right as he was getting married and he stopped serious he was married in about the same
[2:26:12.080 --> 2:26:19.920]  time stormy daniels a couple times reportedly trump never said he was an angel he never said he had
[2:26:19.920 --> 2:26:24.240]  association with playboy association with you know women modeling groups he is a red-blooded type
[2:26:24.240 --> 2:26:31.520]  guy he's got you know five kids uh the uh guy is not a hypocrite he's told me the truth and all
[2:26:31.520 --> 2:26:35.760]  was the truth about getting the economy going rebuilding the military securing the border
[2:26:35.760 --> 2:26:41.680]  uh crushing political correctness he's been truthful about what he said he would do and so now they
[2:26:41.680 --> 2:26:50.560]  have cohen the lawyer who recorded trump over a decade ago agreeing to a payment uh for a uh
[2:26:50.560 --> 2:26:57.200]  woman who hadn't even decided to go public against him and who didn't so it's just him giving a woman
[2:26:57.200 --> 2:27:02.080]  uh you know some money because she was in love with him and and felt bad that he didn't marry
[2:27:02.080 --> 2:27:05.680]  milania and then he didn't break it off that happened sometimes you get married you don't break
[2:27:05.680 --> 2:27:09.920]  off the last girlfriend for a while kind of have a few flings that's what trump did right when he
[2:27:09.920 --> 2:27:15.040]  hit 60 he went through a midlife crisis out of people that know him he was always a one-woman
[2:27:15.040 --> 2:27:19.760]  guy except when he was divorced then he played the field he kind of had a midlife crisis not a big
[2:27:19.760 --> 2:27:24.880]  one at 60 but just felt told that's even a magazine articles back at the time that he kind of went
[2:27:24.880 --> 2:27:30.800]  all wild for about a year so uh and that's not a good thing the point is he's not a hypocrite
[2:27:30.800 --> 2:27:36.320]  and he's a truthful guy and it's true that god literally has had providence on trump
[2:27:36.320 --> 2:27:41.120]  providence on info wars and so the issue is yes the left is saying we want to have sex with your
[2:27:41.120 --> 2:27:45.360]  kids the left is saying uh you know we're going to sexualize your kids and teach them to cut
[2:27:45.360 --> 2:27:49.680]  their genitals off with brainwashing at age five we're going to do all this horrible evil stuff
[2:27:49.680 --> 2:27:57.200]  promote pedophilia salon hbo all of them promote pedophilia but then but then if a guy has private
[2:27:57.200 --> 2:28:04.000]  life over a decade ago you have 12 13 40 years ago went on a jag one a little wild uh then oh my
[2:28:04.000 --> 2:28:09.680]  gosh he's the devil he never said he was a saint and of all the sins you know king david had his
[2:28:09.680 --> 2:28:14.240]  best friend killed so he could have sex with his wife then he repented and got on this and really
[2:28:14.240 --> 2:28:19.040]  was real and god said you're mad for my own heart you know and then changed his wife and so you know
[2:28:19.040 --> 2:28:22.480]  the point is donald trump hadn't had his best friend killed to have sex with a woman got built
[2:28:22.480 --> 2:28:27.120]  just this way god knows our hearts better than other people and you're right men who were redblooded
[2:28:27.120 --> 2:28:32.080]  and it in all these women he's been super nice to super polite uh you know his wives have all said
[2:28:32.080 --> 2:28:37.920]  that his current wife and and and these other women and so that's what it shows is that donald
[2:28:37.920 --> 2:28:41.120]  trump is red blooded the way god made him and that's just the way it is he has a hunger for
[2:28:41.120 --> 2:28:45.440]  things just like he has a hunger for liberty and freedom and the fight to take on the globals now
[2:28:45.440 --> 2:28:49.920]  you have your big guess coming up but i wanted to direct people briefly for two minutes when we

[2:33:22.400 --> 2:33:30.240]  host owin shroyer so the left and the double standards that they exhibit are becoming more
[2:33:30.240 --> 2:33:36.000]  clear than ever whether it be them saying we go high when they go low yet they continue to go lower
[2:33:36.000 --> 2:33:41.840]  and lower spinning on trump supporters ripping their hats off beating people burning american flags
[2:33:41.840 --> 2:33:48.640]  you now have the left that endorses pedophilia covers up for bill clinton and doesn't seem to be
[2:33:48.640 --> 2:33:53.680]  bothered by the sexualization of children now totally outraged that donald trump had a relationship
[2:33:53.680 --> 2:33:59.520]  with a playboy model over a decade ago alex it's incredible that they think they can get away with
[2:33:59.520 --> 2:34:04.800]  this and the average american is not going to see it well they keep saying you christians are immoral
[2:34:04.800 --> 2:34:08.720]  you're on your high horse about you know us and what we're doing but then you don't care about
[2:34:08.720 --> 2:34:13.760]  trump no he was never an hypocrite and it's concerning adults and the left is targeting our
[2:34:13.760 --> 2:34:18.000]  kids and trying to sexualize them and brainwash them that's what we don't like what adults do is
[2:34:18.000 --> 2:34:22.800]  what adults do doesn't mean we don't think it's perfect what trump's doing if he was like one
[2:34:22.800 --> 2:34:27.920]  of these famous preachers that says if you ever have sex outside of marriage you're going to hell
[2:34:27.920 --> 2:34:32.400]  and then you find out the guys banging hookers every night excuse my french that's the people
[2:34:32.400 --> 2:34:37.280]  i don't like his hypocrites and and he noticed christ was all about that he said look at these
[2:34:37.280 --> 2:34:41.520]  Pharisees they tell you how good they are up there on the Sabbath and pray in public but then
[2:34:41.520 --> 2:34:45.680]  behind the scenes are totally wicked he said you know give me somebody that isn't perfect but actually
[2:34:45.680 --> 2:34:49.360]  loves god and tries to be a better person that's what matters but i'm not going to get into preaching
[2:34:49.360 --> 2:34:53.600]  we've got a very important guest coming up right now i want to congratulate for me and very cool
[2:34:53.600 --> 2:34:58.000]  and calm and collected and i'm also exposing what he did and great job of producers getting him so
[2:34:58.000 --> 2:35:02.800]  quickly the story's up on info wars dot com but i wanted to point this out i don't know how long
[2:35:02.800 --> 2:35:07.840]  this cbs reporter is going to have a job like Cheryl Atkinson but this gentleman that you can
[2:35:07.840 --> 2:35:12.720]  go find out his name and see the video is on info wars dot com right below the tops uh
[2:35:12.720 --> 2:35:20.400]  headline scroller with this is why they want a wall is the headline and he goes down there for
[2:35:20.400 --> 2:35:28.000]  15 minutes at the texas mexico border and goes over to the mexican side and sees a boat full
[2:35:28.000 --> 2:35:35.920]  of drugs being brought across by a smuggler just a half mile or so from the main war patrol checkpoint
[2:35:35.920 --> 2:35:41.120]  in plain view just like joe biggs and uh don salazar and the crew caught drugs being brought
[2:35:41.120 --> 2:35:47.040]  across uh right down by the same area a few years ago the media said oh jones just claims its drugs
[2:35:47.040 --> 2:35:52.080]  no the board patrol confirmed the effect confirmed it was at drugs so that's what goes on they bring
[2:35:52.080 --> 2:35:59.760]  these big dingy boats across full of it and the issue is is that it's a collapsed country
[2:35:59.760 --> 2:36:04.320]  especially northern mexico is more dangerous than anywhere else in the world it is the most
[2:36:04.320 --> 2:36:09.600]  dangerous place in the world per square mile hundreds of thousands dead and then they play dumb
[2:36:09.600 --> 2:36:15.040]  and go oh you're hurting children like this green haired uh guy that says he's a non-binary person
[2:36:15.920 --> 2:36:21.280]  and uh he just has all this vile stuff on his twitter spitting and yelling and screaming
[2:36:21.280 --> 2:36:24.720]  in seattle the same thing happened to me had people spit at me didn't catch it on tape
[2:36:24.720 --> 2:36:29.440]  had a guy dump coffee on me didn't catch it on tape had people threatened to attack me and then
[2:36:29.440 --> 2:36:33.520]  they'd always run off and i just they just talked to me so they're so brainwashed and they're so
[2:36:33.520 --> 2:36:40.320]  wound up just like uh we've got judge uh janine piero very classy lady very smart lady she's been
[2:36:40.320 --> 2:36:45.600]  a host for years a co-host off and on on the view she knows whoopee and that video is up on
[2:36:45.600 --> 2:36:50.240]  him full wars dot com it's incredible i think you guys played it earlier and they get in her face
[2:36:50.240 --> 2:36:54.720]  screaming at her during that she's trying to leave she sees whoopee she's whoopee you know

[2:37:12.000 --> 2:37:18.000]  and then this green haired guy that attacked our next guest uh ash and hess says on his own twitter
[2:37:18.000 --> 2:37:25.280]  oh you you kill thousands of children that trump detains i mean why not why not they just take
[2:37:25.280 --> 2:37:30.880]  congress of the day saying that i deny anybody doubted uh parkland never said that i say it's

[2:39:41.200 --> 2:39:46.320]  getting a coffee and we were just sitting there waiting for a ride back to the hotel um waiting
[2:39:46.320 --> 2:39:51.440]  yeah waiting on a ride on the side of the street and i was just on my phone so was my family my
[2:39:51.440 --> 2:39:57.120]  whole family was there and all of a sudden this guy just runs up and i just got hit in the head
[2:39:57.120 --> 2:40:05.040]  and i i didn't know what was going on i didn't know why i and um my dad told me that the girl
[2:40:05.040 --> 2:40:10.080]  that was with him there was a girl with them um she took the hat through to the guy and i look up
[2:40:10.080 --> 2:40:16.800]  then and i'm looking at this guy with green hair and i'm looking over it and the guy is yelling
[2:40:16.800 --> 2:40:22.160]  at me he's got my hat he's and i'm just like come on man come on like is this really necessary
[2:40:22.160 --> 2:40:26.800]  like it completely blindsided me i didn't want to like overreact and go and chase him down or
[2:40:26.800 --> 2:40:32.400]  anything i was just wanted to keep my cool but he threw my he spit on my hat threw it into the
[2:40:32.400 --> 2:40:41.520]  street i was i i really didn't know what to say but um yeah i went after him he cursed at me told
[2:40:41.520 --> 2:40:46.720]  me i wasn't welcome in the city called me a racist and i never met the guy i mean he has no idea what
[2:40:46.720 --> 2:40:53.280]  my views are and i'm surely not a racist but yeah i mean just someone doing that just out of nowhere
[2:40:53.280 --> 2:40:59.360]  is just crazy to me that someone would just do that in the street i'm just visiting the city
[2:40:59.360 --> 2:41:05.840]  just with my family i don't know what the what the deal was well and you caught i think that your
[2:41:05.840 --> 2:41:13.120]  video that you recorded is actually i think like 30 seconds long or something so you're saying you
[2:41:13.120 --> 2:41:17.680]  just thought like immediately after this happened hey i'm gonna get out and record this or how much
[2:41:17.680 --> 2:41:21.600]  time happened between them originally hitting you taking your hat and then you hitting record on
[2:41:21.600 --> 2:41:27.200]  your cell phone so i was already on my phone it was probably about like five to ten seconds
[2:41:27.200 --> 2:41:33.200]  before i hit hit record i had i had been at i went to the march for our lives in my town and
[2:41:33.200 --> 2:41:38.480]  went there and recorded that so i had like started a youtube channel sort of and i saw it as an
[2:41:38.480 --> 2:41:45.360]  opportunity to expose the left to expose what's going on with um america now how people just
[2:41:45.360 --> 2:41:50.400]  think it's okay to just rip hats off kids and yell at them in the street so i saw it as an
[2:41:50.400 --> 2:41:54.880]  opportunity i pulled out my phone right away to get it on video to show my friends and get it out
[2:41:54.880 --> 2:42:00.400]  there to the media and see if um we can get some more voters for the republican party because i
[2:42:00.400 --> 2:42:06.000]  don't think very many people very many uh normal people normal sane people want to support people
[2:42:06.000 --> 2:42:10.480]  like that doing things to kids when they're just visiting a city on vacation with their family well

[2:47:29.040 --> 2:47:38.080]  and he will be eligible to vote in the 2020 presidential election and he's so smart you
[2:47:38.080 --> 2:47:41.840]  heard him in the last segment saying hey look you know i want to record this stuff i went to the
[2:47:41.840 --> 2:47:48.480]  march for our lives to record this stuff i want people my age to see who the left really is so
[2:47:48.480 --> 2:47:54.880]  that they won't be attracted to voting for them in 2020 really smart stuff there there is his
[2:47:54.880 --> 2:48:01.280]  twitter account at hess ashton guys let's pull up his youtube channel too so that the audience can
[2:48:01.280 --> 2:48:06.320]  see where to subscribe and check out his youtube videos i wasn't even aware actually that ashton
[2:48:06.320 --> 2:48:10.720]  had shot a report from a march for our lives so this guy's even more engaged than i thought but
[2:48:10.720 --> 2:48:18.720]  ashton why do you think why do you think you're dealing with people that want to rip your head
[2:48:18.720 --> 2:48:23.600]  off spit on you spit on your hat stomp on your hat make a big scene of it what do you think is
[2:48:23.600 --> 2:48:29.520]  motivating these people to act so deranged um i think what's motivating them to act so deranged
[2:48:29.520 --> 2:48:35.040]  is i mean their leaders don't help uh saying that we should like occupy the airports and do all
[2:48:35.040 --> 2:48:40.800]  these things um follow the trump cabinet around a restaurant make a crowd around them i mean
[2:48:40.800 --> 2:48:45.440]  that doesn't help at all but i also think like they just can't accept other people's views like
[2:48:45.440 --> 2:48:48.720]  just because i think differently than them they just think i'm evil they don't know anything about
[2:48:48.720 --> 2:48:55.120]  me they just assume oh he's got a mega hat on so he must be a terrible racist person and they don't
[2:48:55.120 --> 2:49:01.360]  really look at the facts um they just do it all out of emotion they just get so enraged just because
[2:49:01.360 --> 2:49:06.400]  they see a certain slogan on a hat it's just ridiculous to me how they act and they can't
[2:49:06.400 --> 2:49:11.680]  control themselves whatsoever and now obviously i mean you're gonna have to get a new trump hat
[2:49:11.680 --> 2:49:16.640]  you don't want to wear that hat again and who knows what kind of a disease are infested uh in that
[2:49:16.640 --> 2:49:21.600]  in that man's saliva but yeah you know i i think that you're 100 right you know maxine waters
[2:49:22.160 --> 2:49:27.120]  saying things in fact if you go listen maxine water said you tell them you're not welcome here
[2:49:27.120 --> 2:49:31.520]  that's exactly what the guy said to you he said you're not welcome here that's right out of maxine
[2:49:31.520 --> 2:49:38.320]  waters yep and so what do you think though as someone that's been victimized by this you know
[2:49:38.320 --> 2:49:42.240]  if you want to go out and wear a mega hat this could happen to you now because of people like
[2:49:42.240 --> 2:49:47.200]  maxine waters i mean what do you think about this how do we stop this well you know what when will
[2:49:47.200 --> 2:49:53.440]  maxine waters be held accountable for her rhetoric i mean i just think it's a ridiculous and to stop
[2:49:53.440 --> 2:50:00.720]  it um i don't really know if we can the left has gone so far left recently that um it's it's just
[2:50:00.720 --> 2:50:07.840]  it's an absolute battleground out there i mean just people yelling at you for no reason um i don't
[2:50:07.840 --> 2:50:12.960]  know if maxine waters will ever be held accountable for um what she's said and what she's told her
[2:50:12.960 --> 2:50:18.320]  supporters to do um i hope in some way she is and she can recognize and see these videos and say
[2:50:18.880 --> 2:50:23.360]  that was a mistake i shouldn't have said that now please respect these people and get an open
[2:50:23.360 --> 2:50:27.440]  dialogue because all i want is an open dialogue i don't want a fistfight or anything like that
[2:50:27.440 --> 2:50:31.600]  it's just better to talk about these things instead of yelling scream you know what and i'll
[2:50:31.600 --> 2:50:38.240]  say this because the left wants to virtue signal for for any minority group out there and i could
[2:50:38.240 --> 2:50:42.720]  label one minority group or something like that i'm not gonna do this you you pick you the audience
[2:50:42.720 --> 2:50:48.240]  member you pick pick the minority group or pick whatever group that the left virtue signals for
[2:50:48.240 --> 2:50:53.840]  saying they're victims now let's say that you are a member of that group let's let's just use
[2:50:53.840 --> 2:50:58.400]  transsexuals for an example or or or any of the minorities that they come that they say are being
[2:50:58.400 --> 2:51:06.160]  victimized in america what do you think has a higher risk of violence being done against you of
[2:51:06.160 --> 2:51:11.040]  being assaulted of having someone insult you and experiencing prejudice in the street what do you
[2:51:11.040 --> 2:51:15.920]  think has a greater risk of that any of the minority groups that the left claims are victims or if
[2:51:15.920 --> 2:51:20.960]  you go out on the street in a magahat which group do you think ashen is more likely to experience
[2:51:20.960 --> 2:51:26.720]  prejudice and violence against them um definitely the people in the magahats i mean just because
[2:51:26.720 --> 2:51:32.560]  we support something and they all see them as the villain um then they're gonna attack and that's
[2:51:32.560 --> 2:51:38.480]  just what they do and their leaders are encouraging it to well it's incredible that that happened to
[2:51:38.480 --> 2:51:43.120]  you but i'm glad that you caught it on on video and it's powerful footage and it will make an
[2:51:43.120 --> 2:51:47.680]  impact maybe maybe you change a hundred people's minds maybe you change one person's mind it's
[2:51:47.680 --> 2:51:51.920]  still worth it to get that footage so let's pull up his twitter let's pull up his youtube channel
[2:51:51.920 --> 2:51:56.800]  again let's let's let's get a bunch of traffic to his twitter and to his youtube channel because
[2:51:56.800 --> 2:52:02.320]  ashen is a a young member of america here who's fighting for for patriotism and truth
[2:52:03.120 --> 2:52:10.080]  and we need to have young patriots like him to stand up for truth because the left thinks that
[2:52:10.080 --> 2:52:15.360]  they own the young vote the left thinks that in 2020 they're gonna get the same young vote turnout
[2:52:15.360 --> 2:52:21.520]  like they did in 2008 for obama but if we have more people like ashen hess out there exposing
[2:52:21.520 --> 2:52:30.240]  the left to young people then um then i think that that'll really hurt them where do you think
[2:52:30.240 --> 2:52:36.160]  this is going where do you expect all the hatred against trump supporters to go do you think
[2:52:36.160 --> 2:52:39.520]  they're gonna get more rabid and hateful and violent or do you think they're gonna take a
[2:52:39.520 --> 2:52:45.440]  look in the mirror and realize they've been wrong so i think they're gonna get more rabid and violent
[2:52:45.440 --> 2:52:49.760]  to a point there's gonna be a certain point where they realize they've gone too far and
[2:52:49.760 --> 2:52:53.840]  the whole country is going to turn against them i mean the leftists is distancing themselves
[2:52:53.840 --> 2:52:58.320]  further and further and further and the same people are going to realize that and come to the
[2:52:58.320 --> 2:53:03.200]  right to fight back against it well and this is already happening with the hashtag walk away
[2:53:03.200 --> 2:53:09.200]  there's a youtube channel hashtag walk away and then cnn says oh hashtag walk away is a bunch
[2:53:09.200 --> 2:53:13.680]  of russian bots even though there's a youtube channel with hundreds and hundreds of videos
[2:53:13.680 --> 2:53:18.320]  of all the people that are walking away so so so i guess you're right though and i think what's
[2:53:18.320 --> 2:53:24.160]  going to happen here psychologically is that now they see how badly they're losing they're just
[2:53:24.160 --> 2:53:29.040]  going to act more deranged i think that's what you experienced you know this this this sad soul
[2:53:29.600 --> 2:53:34.000]  a green-haired non-binary i mean you know i'm not even going to begin to break down that
[2:53:34.000 --> 2:53:39.600]  psych psychological paradigm but but this is a guy who i think just feels more and more of an
[2:53:39.600 --> 2:53:44.720]  outcast and is more and more angry at society feeling like he doesn't belong because he's being
[2:53:44.720 --> 2:53:48.960]  told all these things and being told that everyone hates him when he's the one walking around filled
[2:53:48.960 --> 2:53:58.800]  with hate and you caught it on camera another question that i have for you um when when when
[2:53:58.800 --> 2:54:05.280]  you saw the green-haired non-binary come up and do that to you was there anyone else around there
[2:54:05.280 --> 2:54:10.160]  did they cheer it on did they say he was crazy uh what was it like for other people around that
[2:54:10.160 --> 2:54:15.600]  witnessed that um so it was basically just me and my family and we didn't like see him walk
[2:54:15.600 --> 2:54:20.160]  up or anything he's just completely blindsided us so we were all in shock but he was with a girl
[2:54:20.160 --> 2:54:26.320]  the girl in the video you saw um she like said oh you know what it says on that hat right like
[2:54:26.320 --> 2:54:31.920]  she like said it like you deserve it like she cheered it on and it was just them to everyone
[2:54:31.920 --> 2:54:36.720]  else was just kind of in shock just looking around like that kid just got attacked by a
[2:54:36.720 --> 2:54:41.920]  guy with green hair and i think everyone was just more surprised and they didn't really have time to
[2:54:41.920 --> 2:54:48.240]  react and so they probably saw that now and if they were politically neutral what side of the
[2:54:48.240 --> 2:54:52.720]  aisle do you think they're going to go to now well i think they're going to go to the right i mean
[2:54:53.440 --> 2:54:59.520]  no one wants to support a person that attacks children because they have a certain hat on
[2:55:00.240 --> 2:55:04.960]  and think about what she says she says oh you see what your hat says yeah it says make america
[2:55:04.960 --> 2:55:09.840]  great again aren't you an american like they don't even understand that they've been so propagandized
[2:55:09.840 --> 2:55:17.920]  into hating their own prosperity yeah i mean she she said that like you know what it says like you
[2:55:17.920 --> 2:55:22.640]  should be ashamed of yourself i'm not ashamed i that's what i believe in and i don't i don't think
[2:55:22.640 --> 2:55:28.720]  it represents racism or anything to that degree if it did i wouldn't be wearing the hat exactly now
[2:55:28.720 --> 2:55:34.320]  of course you're a high school student and uh i'm just curious has your political activism
[2:55:34.320 --> 2:55:38.000]  made it to your high school are you politically active there do you have dialogue there or do
[2:55:38.000 --> 2:55:43.600]  you kind of not go into those realms in high school yeah so that march for our lives thing
[2:55:43.600 --> 2:55:48.720]  that was organized by a bunch of people at my high school and i had a video up about discussing
[2:55:49.440 --> 2:55:53.120]  with the people that went to my high school we actually had really good dialogue a lot more
[2:55:53.120 --> 2:55:58.720]  than the adults there and i'm moving into next year we're starting a young republicans club and
[2:55:58.720 --> 2:56:03.040]  i'll be the president and founder of that so we're moving into that we're gonna promote healthy
[2:56:03.040 --> 2:56:07.840]  dialogue promote our republican values and hopefully get some people over to our side of the aisle
[2:56:07.840 --> 2:56:13.680]  before we go to the battleground which is college dude you are kicking ass let me tell you something
[2:56:13.680 --> 2:56:19.760]  illinois is a blue state that typically goes blue i have a bunch of friends and family in illinois
[2:56:19.760 --> 2:56:24.800]  that are capitalists and they see the democrat party going socialist it scares them to death
[2:56:25.440 --> 2:56:29.120]  you i'm telling you man you you could make a difference in this next election or in future
[2:56:29.120 --> 2:56:34.080]  elections because it's people like you that can turn the state of illinois red which is what it
[2:56:34.080 --> 2:56:41.120]  used to be it used to go red you know the land of lincoln so this is actually an incredible thing
[2:56:41.120 --> 2:56:46.400]  with the democrats going socialist democrats in illinois are capitalists you could see an
[2:56:46.400 --> 2:56:50.960]  opportunity with the young vote and the stuff that you're doing that could actually change the
[2:56:50.960 --> 2:56:54.960]  outcome of future elections so so ashton you're doing great work uh just once again tell the

[2:59:53.760 --> 2:59:59.520]  in the conditioning the lord's comes to mind alex jones alex jones there's a lot of controversy
[2:59:59.520 --> 3:00:04.400]  around this network about alex jones google is being accused of hiding negative stories about
[3:00:04.400 --> 3:00:10.800]  hillary and her campaign by changing his algorithm to bury stories like the clitney body count story
[3:00:10.800 --> 3:00:15.680]  that's according to website info wars the coverage is confirmed there are recent shooters to the fully
[3:00:15.680 --> 3:00:22.800]  automatic weapons doctor margillam lucerskin has been shot to death in mental sympathy kfk
[3:00:22.800 --> 3:00:36.720]  was shot from the back and the front i think this is a national security
[3:00:37.200 --> 3:00:44.320]  we have clear things that we do not understand how they work operating in areas that we can't control
[3:00:44.320 --> 3:00:50.560]  ufo excuse this global governance at last is it one world the central bank is in charge is real
[3:00:50.560 --> 3:00:55.840]  claims the attack was accidental but some former u.s naval officers say it was on purpose they
[3:00:55.840 --> 3:01:02.320]  described the day's action as part of a continuing cover russian intelligence compiled a dossier on
[3:01:02.320 --> 3:01:09.040]  mr trump during visits to moscow russian scum denied everything he called it all fake news and he
[3:01:09.040 --> 3:01:15.760]  accused cnn of being fake news this is a national operation if they killed trump or removed trump
[3:01:15.760 --> 3:01:21.200]  is a cause a massive civil war in this country this is a key in the high level of religion
[3:01:23.200 --> 3:01:28.080]  we are in war with russia are you aware that mr stone also stated publicly that he was in direct
[3:01:28.080 --> 3:01:32.800]  communication with jillian assange and wikipedia the white house and the president are citing
[3:01:32.800 --> 3:01:39.760]  info wars they can shut us down you're next if you are receiving this transmission you are the
[3:01:39.760 --> 3:01:49.840]  resistance it's alex jones the view a panel of leftists viewing elinski i propaganda slogans
[3:01:49.840 --> 3:01:56.080]  based on weaponized disinformation to their global mob audience it's only a matter of time before
[3:01:56.080 --> 3:02:03.120]  trump derangement syndrome begins to bubble to the surface i mean i have been in the crime
[3:02:03.120 --> 3:02:10.560]  business for over three decades and i think i said that before and i know a con when i see it and i
[3:02:10.560 --> 3:02:17.520]  think that what has happened in the last i think that what has happened truly in the last campaign
[3:02:17.520 --> 3:02:23.120]  and everybody needs to be concerned about that lady justice is supposed to be blind not an
[3:02:23.120 --> 3:02:29.120]  ideologue i'm not i am in law let me let me ask you a question right and do you think um do you
[3:02:29.120 --> 3:02:36.160]  think donald trump embraces and embodies conservative ideology remember he used to be uh i have a
[3:02:36.160 --> 3:02:43.200]  different position on pro-choice uh he's imposing tariffs he's against globalism do you think he is
[3:02:43.200 --> 3:02:47.760]  an ideologue that is faithful to conservative policies you know i'm not here to talk about what
[3:02:47.760 --> 3:02:54.720]  donald trump is and i don't know you gotta answer my talk about you want to talk about donald trump
[3:02:54.720 --> 3:03:02.720]  you tell me what metric in this country is worse off unemployment is lower than it's been in 50 years
[3:03:02.720 --> 3:03:09.280]  minorities hispanics african-americans have jobs what they haven't had it's probably hate crimes
[3:03:09.280 --> 3:03:15.600]  i won't and wait a minute the gdp under obama was barely one we're going up to four democrats don't
[3:03:15.600 --> 3:03:19.440]  get there you know what together he's certainly going to get here's my question for you here's my
[3:03:19.440 --> 3:03:25.040]  question for you because you talk about you think you talk about i am not just nobody else oh yeah
[3:03:25.040 --> 3:03:30.240]  did you just point at me yeah listen i don't have trump derangement let me tell you what i have
[3:03:30.240 --> 3:03:37.680]  okay i have a lot of i'm tired of people starting a conversation with mexican's olayris and rapist
[3:03:37.680 --> 3:03:44.000]  i'm tired of people starting a conversation this is where the trump derangement syndrome starts
[3:03:44.000 --> 3:03:51.120]  to fester whoopee is arguing a moot point yes whoopee over 32 of federal inmates in the us
[3:03:51.120 --> 3:03:58.240]  are illegal aliens and yes roughly 5 000 us citizens die every year as a result of illegal
[3:03:58.240 --> 3:04:04.160]  alien drivers and yes there is a largely ignored rape epidemic of american children by illegal
[3:04:04.160 --> 3:04:11.120]  aliens and yes it does cost the u.s. taxpayers roughly 113 billion dollars per year to pick up
[3:04:11.120 --> 3:04:17.440]  the tab on the illegals pouring over our border whoopee's frustration is meaningless because
[3:04:17.440 --> 3:04:24.560]  regardless of what fantasy the left may believe we do have immigration laws and most americans want
[3:04:24.560 --> 3:04:30.800]  them enforced and strengthened listen i'm 62 years old there have been a lot of people in office
[3:04:30.800 --> 3:04:37.840]  that i didn't agree with but i have never ever seen anything like this i've never seen anybody
[3:04:37.840 --> 3:04:45.920]  whip up such hate i've never seen anybody be so dismissive next whoopee mockingly asked what is
[3:04:45.920 --> 3:04:51.440]  the deep state as if it were on par with the fictional legion of doom one of the things that you
[3:04:54.800 --> 3:05:02.640]  anyone who studied history and knows how human systems work is horrified we have global hardcore
[3:05:02.640 --> 3:05:07.840]  anti-human psychopaths in control the big corporations they're trying to wreck free market
[3:05:07.840 --> 3:05:13.600]  and consolidate total control dumb humanity down ahead of replacing us with machines and
[3:05:13.600 --> 3:05:18.640]  trump has come in and is resisting that and saying we have a human future they are launching a civil
[3:05:18.640 --> 3:05:23.760]  war against nation states right now collapsing our borders and my only message is this everybody
[3:05:23.760 --> 3:05:29.040]  better wake up and realize the fight is now everybody should be very very urgent because the
[3:05:29.040 --> 3:05:34.160]  left and the globalists are frantic and launching their anti-human plan because they crave to control
[3:05:34.160 --> 3:05:39.440]  people those of us that are pro-human don't crave power we already have the power but we have to
[3:05:39.440 --> 3:05:45.600]  realize these scum are coming after us and we have to speak out and take action now info wars is on
[3:05:45.600 --> 3:06:01.520]  the front line and so are you we are the resistance
[3:06:01.520 --> 3:06:15.520]  and
[3:06:16.640 --> 3:06:21.680]  and welcome back to the alex joneshow and this is uh dr nick baggage and i'm going to be with you
[3:06:21.680 --> 3:06:26.800]  for the next few segments and alex will be coming back for the uh last two segments of this hour
[3:06:26.800 --> 3:06:33.840]  this fourth hour uh today and i'm broadcasting today from a last actually my home uh in uh in
[3:06:33.840 --> 3:06:39.680]  anchorage and and i want to kind of pick up uh where some of um uh the last segment left off
[3:06:39.680 --> 3:06:43.600]  you know first of all talking about you know background and the diversity of thought and
[3:06:43.600 --> 3:06:49.520]  how much anger and violence is it's showing up in our culture right now is pretty disheartening
[3:06:49.520 --> 3:06:54.320]  to all of us and i want to talk about that in the context of my own family i'm a libertarian
[3:06:54.320 --> 3:07:00.480]  before that for 25 years i was a last independence party which is very different from my um
[3:07:01.760 --> 3:07:07.120]  family and my parents history they're both uh were democrats my father was united states congressman
[3:07:07.120 --> 3:07:14.000]  a state senator uh my younger brother uh mark was a state senator as a dem excuse me u.s senator
[3:07:14.000 --> 3:07:19.120]  as a democrat was a mayor of anchorage a couple of terms uh anchorage assembly a couple of terms
[3:07:19.120 --> 3:07:25.600]  my other brother tom is a member of the state senate uh also a democrat my son is a republican
[3:07:26.720 --> 3:07:32.480]  and since he was a young man uh in his teens a young republican all the way up to now and is
[3:07:32.480 --> 3:07:38.080]  just just turning 40 um republican all his life an active new republican party here
[3:07:38.080 --> 3:07:43.200]  now you can imagine uh with republicans and democrats and libertarians and independence
[3:07:43.200 --> 3:07:50.480]  i might add coming together at the holidays makes for a pretty lively debate because my family are
[3:07:50.480 --> 3:07:57.920]  all very informed uh and have very strong positions but but as a model for the country the idea of
[3:07:57.920 --> 3:08:04.640]  speak even speech that is repugnant um quite frankly to one another we still are able to have
[3:08:04.640 --> 3:08:10.640]  and it's not an environment of tolerance you know this idea that somehow we shut up and tolerate
[3:08:10.640 --> 3:08:18.800]  things no no not in that but in a real discussion that's respectful that means we accept the right
[3:08:18.800 --> 3:08:25.200]  of the other party to say what they need to say and make their point um but at the same time with
[3:08:25.200 --> 3:08:30.240]  an obligation kind of informally in my family if you're going to complain you also come in with a
[3:08:30.240 --> 3:08:35.200]  solution set and even if it isn't the one that's arrived at in the end that's what we usually end
[3:08:35.200 --> 3:08:40.960]  up debating not the fact that there's a problem but sort of what's the solution to it and i mean
[3:08:40.960 --> 3:08:46.320]  what i want to say about that is what we're seeing now so much now from the left is this hangar this
[3:08:46.320 --> 3:08:55.040]  eight eight i ain't even violence um this is not the way uh or shutting down speech again an effort
[3:08:55.040 --> 3:09:00.560]  from uh from the left you know let's not let anybody say what they think and let's beat people
[3:09:00.560 --> 3:09:07.360]  up in the street for their political views for goodness sake i mean as much as religion as a
[3:09:07.360 --> 3:09:13.360]  reason um for not being beat up in the street are your political views uh i mean these are protected
[3:09:14.240 --> 3:09:20.640]  speech i mean short of screaming fire in a movie theater where people have put an immediate danger
[3:09:20.640 --> 3:09:28.640]  speech should be allowed uh at a level higher than tolerance acceptance and open discussion
[3:09:28.640 --> 3:09:33.840]  and the kinds of things that lead us to practical and real solutions and i'm i'm going to dedicate
[3:09:33.840 --> 3:09:40.320]  most of my time today to talking about problems and solutions uh in the context of not left right
[3:09:40.320 --> 3:09:47.040]  right wrong but how do we get through the mud hole the swamp and you want to talk about a deep
[3:09:47.040 --> 3:09:53.440]  state i'll tell you about a deep state deep state took out my father when he was a congressman
[3:09:53.440 --> 3:09:58.880]  disappeared him as a congressman along with the majority of the u.s. house in the early 70s that's
[3:09:58.880 --> 3:10:06.320]  a story for another day um we found out uh through fb i tell x's released 20 years later
[3:10:06.320 --> 3:10:12.160]  sort of what happened i don't trust the fbi they're part of that deep state they have been
[3:10:12.160 --> 3:10:17.840]  since the beginning since huva ran the place um when you look at the kennedy family now 50 years
[3:10:17.840 --> 3:10:24.160]  elapsed now more is coming out they don't believe it was an accident either whether it's robert or uh
[3:10:24.160 --> 3:10:31.360]  jfk this is deep state and operation ladies and gentlemen and i know because it's happened to
[3:10:31.360 --> 3:10:38.080]  my family and and this is reality of it but solutions are what we need right now and dialogue
[3:10:38.080 --> 3:10:44.640]  that is healthy not for the sake of political correctness at all but for the sake of open real
[3:10:44.640 --> 3:10:50.640]  discussion and one of the other rules my family my son was in austin recently in a republican
[3:10:50.640 --> 3:10:58.560]  gathering and he was in a in an after uh after the meetings having a drink with some of the guys
[3:10:58.560 --> 3:11:06.720]  and some guy you literally wanted to engage him in a political debate but not at a rational level
[3:11:06.720 --> 3:11:13.680]  of discourse but elevating screaming hollering my son said wait and you know my this is how we do
[3:11:13.680 --> 3:11:19.440]  you know we don't elevate with him we just keep lowering our voice the louder they get the quieter
[3:11:19.440 --> 3:11:24.560]  we get until they got a really listening close to rammels whispering or we stopped it in this case
[3:11:24.560 --> 3:11:30.000]  he had to stop and say look you want to have a discussion without the emotional overlay so we
[3:11:30.000 --> 3:11:36.400]  can actually talk i'll stay and have the conversation otherwise i'm leaving and that is it you know
[3:11:36.400 --> 3:11:40.960]  turn down the volume and let's have a discussion america and get through the stuff together
[3:11:40.960 --> 3:11:45.200]  whether we agree with each other or not and i and i want to jump into some issues
[3:11:45.200 --> 3:11:49.280]  leaping off from there and the one you know i'm thinking about what can i cover in this
[3:11:49.280 --> 3:11:53.920]  in these segments because uh alex is going to grab those last two really important stuff that has
[3:11:53.920 --> 3:11:58.800]  to be dealt with but i want to at least take on an issue today and i want to take on health care
[3:11:59.440 --> 3:12:04.720]  and i want to talk about how it plays into the media frenzy i don't watch tv i gave it about
[3:12:04.720 --> 3:12:10.880]  seven years ago when i travel i click it on and see what's going on and it's i cannot believe the
[3:12:10.880 --> 3:12:16.080]  pharmaceutical industry advertising and you can't shut them up because that's free speech right i mean
[3:12:16.080 --> 3:12:22.480]  they can advertise prescription drugs that nobody wants and virtually can buy because you're not an
[3:12:22.480 --> 3:12:30.320]  md but they're going to tell you and they're going to spend you know 40 of drug costs in america are
[3:12:30.320 --> 3:12:36.800]  related to the advertising costs 40 to convince you to buy something you can't buy and i can't
[3:12:36.800 --> 3:12:42.240]  advertise cigarettes on tv but the reason you can't is that was the settlement of a lawsuit
[3:12:42.240 --> 3:12:46.160]  because they had lied to everybody and told everybody it's safe when in fact they knew it was
[3:12:46.160 --> 3:12:52.320]  killing everyone so they have to you know remove their speech from public airwaves as a settlement
[3:12:52.320 --> 3:12:56.240]  for the industry we don't have that kind of leverage with the pharmaceutical industry so they're free
[3:12:56.240 --> 3:13:02.320]  to advertise whatever they want but what we do have is a tax code make it so it is not tax deductible
[3:13:02.320 --> 3:13:09.280]  and it has to come out of shareholder profits non-deductible promotion for doctors except
[3:13:09.280 --> 3:13:12.960]  for the free samples give them the free samples no problem because a lot of times there's a lot of
[3:13:12.960 --> 3:13:17.600]  people can't afford prescriptions so that's cool gives the doctor something to hand out but but no
[3:13:17.600 --> 3:13:22.560]  more paid perks for dogs no no deductibility can't deduct you can do whatever you want but it's coming
[3:13:22.560 --> 3:13:28.000]  out of shareholder problems and you can't advertise and deduct it you can do whatever you want but
[3:13:28.720 --> 3:13:33.040]  you're gonna eat the cough not the guy buying the prescription drug through tax deductions
[3:13:33.040 --> 3:13:36.800]  and other loopholes so you take that away and then another thing you can do with the pharmaceutical
[3:13:36.800 --> 3:13:45.680]  industry is set a law that says they cannot sell a pharmaceutical in the united states for one
[3:13:45.680 --> 3:13:52.400]  cent more than they sell it anywhere else in the world at the wholesale level and then create
[3:13:52.400 --> 3:13:56.880]  a whistleblower mechanism so executives come forward get a percentage of the action for when
[3:13:56.880 --> 3:14:03.200]  they identify the pharmaceutical companies to break the law now that's how you equalize price
[3:14:04.000 --> 3:14:09.120]  on something required for the very living of people in the vultures in this industry that
[3:14:09.120 --> 3:14:16.960]  are feeding off of us with 18 percent of our GNP absorbed by medical costs this is the problem
[3:14:16.960 --> 3:14:24.320]  part of the problem at least and 40 percent 60 percent of all medical costs in america are
[3:14:24.320 --> 3:14:32.080]  pharmaceuticals and 40 percent of that is this propaganda that is saturating our airwaves and
[3:14:32.080 --> 3:14:38.560]  owning the media because of the amount of money spent there and deducted and you and i are paying
[3:14:38.560 --> 3:14:44.720]  for it in high pharma bills disproportionate to the whole planet and we're doing most of the
[3:14:44.720 --> 3:14:49.600]  basic research in the world although the chinese are catching up finding more patents than we are
[3:14:49.600 --> 3:14:55.840]  all the time so i want to talk with a couple more dimensions on health care because these are real
[3:14:55.840 --> 3:15:01.040]  solutions that make a difference on the bills we're paying you know in alaska i'll give you the
[3:15:01.040 --> 3:15:08.160]  worst example in the united states because i'm in it 500 percent more are charged for general
[3:15:08.720 --> 3:15:12.400]  medical procedures in alaska than the rest of the country although the costs here
[3:15:12.400 --> 3:15:23.520]  are only 30 percent 34 percent more we pay five times as much for 34 percent more in costs this
[3:15:23.520 --> 3:15:32.720]  is profiteering this is what is in the way of the truth greed by shareholders of companies that
[3:15:32.720 --> 3:15:37.440]  don't even know there are corporate boards doing this and there's more news when we get back after
[3:15:37.440 --> 3:15:45.520]  the break i got something to tell you about big pharma and how they are creating the worst pandemic
[3:15:45.520 --> 3:15:50.880]  in the history of the world through their pharma we'll be right back after these short messages

[3:20:39.680 --> 3:20:41.680]  The answer to 1984
[3:20:41.680 --> 3:20:43.680]  was 1776.
[3:20:43.680 --> 3:20:45.680]  The answer to 1984
[3:20:45.680 --> 3:20:47.680]  was 1776.
[3:20:47.680 --> 3:20:49.680]  The answer to 1984
[3:20:49.680 --> 3:20:51.680]  was 1776.
[3:20:51.680 --> 3:20:53.680]  The answer to 1984
[3:20:53.680 --> 3:20:55.680]  was 1776.
[3:20:55.680 --> 3:20:57.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:21:01.680 --> 3:21:03.680]  Welcome back.
[3:21:03.680 --> 3:21:05.680]  This is Dr. Nick Feggett
[3:21:05.680 --> 3:21:07.680]  standing in this last hour
[3:21:07.680 --> 3:21:09.680]  covering the health care issue
[3:21:09.680 --> 3:21:11.680]  in the last segment.
[3:21:11.680 --> 3:21:13.680]  I want to jump back into that
[3:21:13.680 --> 3:21:15.680]  just to recap.
[3:21:15.680 --> 3:21:17.680]  Pharmaceutical industry, 60%
[3:21:17.680 --> 3:21:19.680]  of the cost of medicine
[3:21:19.680 --> 3:21:25.360]  40% of that is advertising to people that cannot make the decision to buy the product.
[3:21:25.360 --> 3:21:33.760]  And the simple solution, eliminate the deductibility, the tax deductibility of advertising for prescription
[3:21:33.760 --> 3:21:41.200]  drugs, including the Dr. Perks that are handed out, trips and whatever, make those not deductible
[3:21:41.200 --> 3:21:42.640]  to the pharmaceutical industry.
[3:21:42.640 --> 3:21:49.680]  And you have just ended a huge problem of both overpricing of medicine and controlling
[3:21:49.680 --> 3:21:53.800]  the media, because too much of the media's revenue stream is derived from this very same
[3:21:53.800 --> 3:21:54.800]  source.
[3:21:54.800 --> 3:21:57.560]  It's a collaboration for goodness sake.
[3:21:57.560 --> 3:22:02.080]  When you think about, you can't cut off the speech, but you don't have to reward speech
[3:22:02.080 --> 3:22:03.680]  that works against us.
[3:22:03.680 --> 3:22:11.360]  And then set the price at the federal level, say that they cannot wholesale a medical prescription
[3:22:11.360 --> 3:22:18.520]  drug in the United States for one anymore than anywhere else, allowing for transportation
[3:22:18.520 --> 3:22:24.160]  adjustments that they sell it in the world, so that we're paying on an equal playing field
[3:22:24.160 --> 3:22:28.000]  and then let the retail market sort it out in terms of competition.
[3:22:28.000 --> 3:22:29.000]  But we're not.
[3:22:29.000 --> 3:22:33.640]  You have to go run to Canada to try and buy it, but it doesn't stop there.
[3:22:33.640 --> 3:22:40.800]  The medical industry is 18% of the entire gross national product, and we're rated somewhere
[3:22:40.800 --> 3:22:45.320]  in the 40s by both Bloomberg and the World Health Organization in terms of efficiency
[3:22:45.320 --> 3:22:47.200]  and quality of care.
[3:22:47.200 --> 3:22:54.640]  Ecuador is in the 20s and spends 7% of their gross national product on medical care, and
[3:22:54.640 --> 3:23:00.880]  they're better at efficiency and quality of care than the United States by leaps and bounds.
[3:23:00.880 --> 3:23:04.400]  And that, I mean, those aren't the only statistics.
[3:23:04.400 --> 3:23:07.800]  Yet when you think about this industry, the pharmaceutical industry, let me tell you something
[3:23:07.800 --> 3:23:14.160]  recently, the biggest pandemic that had our way is opiates, and we all hear about heroin,
[3:23:14.160 --> 3:23:19.400]  the cheap one, and then you now have oxycodone, and you know the big lawsuits have been settled
[3:23:19.400 --> 3:23:23.320]  there for billions, but now they're applying that strategy all over the world where they're
[3:23:23.320 --> 3:23:24.320]  not going to have lawsuits.
[3:23:24.320 --> 3:23:26.680]  You're going to create addicts everywhere.
[3:23:26.680 --> 3:23:35.320]  And fentanyl, much more powerful than oxycodone, it can be manufactured right in the country
[3:23:35.320 --> 3:23:39.880]  by these black marketers and is even worse.
[3:23:39.880 --> 3:23:42.720]  Now let me give you some examples of what's happened there.
[3:23:42.720 --> 3:23:48.000]  Oxycodone, a reporter in West Virginia, followed a story where 9 million capsules went into
[3:23:48.000 --> 3:23:50.280]  the community of Kermit, West Virginia.
[3:23:50.280 --> 3:23:57.200]  9 million capsules in a year of oxycodone for a whole population of 400, right?
[3:23:57.200 --> 3:24:00.680]  Well, the reporter reported on the DEA says, yeah, we're following it.
[3:24:00.680 --> 3:24:02.560]  We're going to nail them, and they nail them.
[3:24:02.560 --> 3:24:12.000]  And then in 2016, the Congress made it illegal for the DEA to use that method of catching
[3:24:12.000 --> 3:24:16.080]  these distribution capsules.
[3:24:16.080 --> 3:24:19.200]  Directly from the pharmaceutical industry where they know what's going on and where
[3:24:19.200 --> 3:24:24.040]  it's going to not provide that basic data, it doesn't tell anybody who's getting prescribed,
[3:24:24.040 --> 3:24:27.400]  no HIPAA rules are violated, no HIPAA privacy is violated.
[3:24:27.400 --> 3:24:33.600]  Because the corporation's flow of drugs from one place to another, it ought to be documented.
[3:24:33.600 --> 3:24:42.120]  And it's not documented in a way that the DEA can now use that to go after these suppliers.
[3:24:42.120 --> 3:24:44.040]  They're just drug dealers.
[3:24:44.040 --> 3:24:47.520]  And where the literature shows that you have to attack the problem is at the distribution
[3:24:47.520 --> 3:24:51.840]  channels, which includes two channels, the black market that we all know about.
[3:24:51.840 --> 3:24:57.840]  And then there's the so-called not black market, which is doctors over prescribing medications
[3:24:57.840 --> 3:25:00.160]  in a way that is criminal, quite frankly.
[3:25:00.160 --> 3:25:04.200]  And they just convicted one here in Alaska of this, was traveling here, all the addicts
[3:25:04.200 --> 3:25:07.240]  knew who he was.
[3:25:07.240 --> 3:25:08.240]  This is a problem.
[3:25:08.240 --> 3:25:14.680]  But when the industry can preempt a law that allows the DEA a tool that can stop it or choke
[3:25:14.680 --> 3:25:19.600]  it off at least from one channel, their hands are tied.
[3:25:19.600 --> 3:25:22.360]  That's how powerful this industry is.
[3:25:22.360 --> 3:25:28.800]  It's time to bring them back to reality, control pricing to equal whatever they wholesale anywhere
[3:25:28.800 --> 3:25:29.800]  else in the world.
[3:25:29.800 --> 3:25:36.440]  So we're not subsidizing the world on medications too, but we're all paying our fair share.
[3:25:36.440 --> 3:25:38.440]  One of the biggest, simplest things we can do.
[3:25:38.440 --> 3:25:43.240]  The other is tort reform as it relates to the pharmaceutical industry.
[3:25:43.240 --> 3:25:50.840]  This industry kills, they say, half of all of the people that die from medical malpractice
[3:25:50.840 --> 3:25:53.120]  are pharmaceutical interactions.
[3:25:53.120 --> 3:25:55.120]  Half.
[3:25:55.120 --> 3:25:59.680]  That's 50,000 people a year, according to Harvard as of 10 or 15 years ago.
[3:25:59.680 --> 3:26:04.440]  This is more than die and all the active wars going on in the world right now is in terms
[3:26:04.440 --> 3:26:05.440]  of Americans.
[3:26:05.440 --> 3:26:07.280]  Nobody even talks about it.
[3:26:07.280 --> 3:26:12.440]  50,000 people from drug overdose, you know, how easy it is to solve.
[3:26:12.440 --> 3:26:16.760]  Every time you prescribe a prescription drug, it ought to be database, so a computer analog
[3:26:16.760 --> 3:26:21.440]  can judge the interactions and immediately notify the doctor.
[3:26:21.440 --> 3:26:22.840]  Wow.
[3:26:22.840 --> 3:26:23.840]  Simple solution.
[3:26:23.840 --> 3:26:30.200]  It saves 50,000 lives a year, avoids half of the tort lawsuits a year.
[3:26:30.200 --> 3:26:34.680]  You know, it's not a case of tort reform to limit our ability to sue somebody that messes
[3:26:34.680 --> 3:26:39.400]  us up, but let's get rid of the lawsuits to begin with by solving the problems of people
[3:26:39.400 --> 3:26:49.240]  that don't die from this industry that overcharges and puts everyone at risk because of it.
[3:26:49.240 --> 3:26:54.840]  And now the solutions aren't about, it's mandating coverages, it's forcing us to buy
[3:26:54.840 --> 3:26:57.560]  overpriced products.
[3:26:57.560 --> 3:26:59.840]  This is fundamentally wrong.
[3:26:59.840 --> 3:27:06.960]  So you have to go after the big pharma, not because capitalism is wrong, it's because
[3:27:06.960 --> 3:27:13.520]  capitalism is right, and a level playing field is fair, but this is a multinational
[3:27:13.520 --> 3:27:19.960]  companies that do not care about American interests because corporate interests are
[3:27:19.960 --> 3:27:22.280]  not our interests.
[3:27:22.280 --> 3:27:25.160]  In this instance, we need to look at this.
[3:27:25.160 --> 3:27:29.560]  And then we need to look at the background research and how much American taxpayer university
[3:27:29.560 --> 3:27:35.080]  research pays for so much of the fundamentals that eventually ends up in these pharmaceuticals.
[3:27:35.080 --> 3:27:40.040]  So I mean, we're paying it in so many different ways, and I'm not saying those are good things,
[3:27:40.040 --> 3:27:43.680]  but how we manage this in the public interest does matter.
[3:27:43.680 --> 3:27:49.840]  What we do in the future about these things does matter, and the fact is advertising in
[3:27:49.840 --> 3:27:54.280]  venues that make no sense from a real standpoint.
[3:27:54.280 --> 3:27:55.560]  What are they trying to do?
[3:27:55.560 --> 3:28:01.720]  Put pressure on patients to pressure doctors to increase sales, whether it's in your health
[3:28:01.720 --> 3:28:07.000]  interests or not, and to get you hooked on a reoccurring revenue source that pops in
[3:28:07.000 --> 3:28:11.240]  every month for your new prescription.
[3:28:11.240 --> 3:28:15.760]  But if it's going to be the case, if this is the pharmacy we want, let it be one that
[3:28:15.760 --> 3:28:21.960]  reflects honesty, integrity, and the true market conditions within a democratic republic
[3:28:21.960 --> 3:28:24.000]  that goes beyond political influence.
[3:28:24.000 --> 3:28:25.600]  This has been Dr. Nick Faggich today.

[3:31:50.280 --> 3:31:54.920]  Everybody needs to try alpha power today.
[3:31:54.920 --> 3:32:00.280]  Everyone who's studied history and knows how human systems work is horrified.
[3:32:00.280 --> 3:32:05.840]  We have global, hardcore, anti-human psychopaths in control of the big corporations.
[3:32:05.840 --> 3:32:11.160]  They're trying to wreck free market and consolidate total control, dumb humanity down ahead of
[3:32:11.160 --> 3:32:15.600]  replacing us with machines and Trump has come in and is resisting that and saying we have
[3:32:15.600 --> 3:32:16.600]  a human future.
[3:32:16.600 --> 3:32:21.400]  They are launching a civil war against nation states right now, collapsing our borders and
[3:32:21.400 --> 3:32:26.960]  my only message is this, everybody better wake up and realize the fight is now.
[3:32:26.960 --> 3:32:30.680]  Everybody should be very, very urgent because the left and the globalists are frantic and
[3:32:30.680 --> 3:32:34.840]  launching their anti-human plan because they crave to control people.
[3:32:34.840 --> 3:32:38.960]  Those of us that are pro-human don't create power, we already have the power but we have
[3:32:38.960 --> 3:32:44.480]  to realize these scum are coming after us and we have to speak out and take action now.
[3:32:44.480 --> 3:32:47.200]  Info wars is on the front line and so are you.
[3:32:47.200 --> 3:32:57.360]  We are the resistance.
[3:32:57.360 --> 3:33:03.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:33:03.440 --> 3:33:05.720]  A lot of you are going to go to prison.
[3:33:05.720 --> 3:33:09.280]  Trump has only been letting you have rope.
[3:33:09.280 --> 3:33:14.360]  Like a fish you let run out on that line, you only hold back to get him tired.
[3:33:14.360 --> 3:33:19.400]  Run deep, bitch, run hard because when I'm done we're turning the engines on and I'm
[3:33:19.400 --> 3:33:24.360]  getting strapped in and we're hauling your ass in on metal line and we're going to chop
[3:33:24.360 --> 3:33:32.040]  you up on the deck with cold beer on shore and fry your ass and enjoy you.
[3:33:32.040 --> 3:33:39.480]  And you will make us strong, you will feed us cowards but we never start the fight scum.
[3:33:39.480 --> 3:33:41.440]  We only finish it.
[3:33:41.440 --> 3:33:50.240]  Like King George III or Hitler or Harahito, get ready to have your ass handed to you.
[3:33:50.240 --> 3:33:55.280]  Alex Jones obviously is one of the conspiracy theorists whose brand is bullying.
[3:33:55.280 --> 3:33:58.800]  Alex Jones is going to hear this, he's going to say, why is CNN out to get me?
[3:33:58.800 --> 3:34:00.160]  Why are you trying to take me down?
[3:34:00.160 --> 3:34:01.880]  What's happened with the Info Wars?
[3:34:01.880 --> 3:34:03.280]  Why are they still on Facebook?
[3:34:03.280 --> 3:34:06.720]  Does it stop with Jones or does it also transfer to other outlets?
[3:34:06.720 --> 3:34:11.200]  I want to know how you're dealing with all these conspiracy theorists on your platform.
[3:34:11.200 --> 3:34:18.320]  They engaged in premeditated defamation, these people are all lawyers, they're very smart.
[3:34:18.320 --> 3:34:22.920]  They defame me in fake lawsuits they filed, fun about the Democratic Party, knowing they're
[3:34:22.920 --> 3:34:27.720]  protected filing false statements under defamation in lawsuits and then they do it as members
[3:34:27.720 --> 3:34:33.600]  of Congress protected with immunity for false statements.
[3:34:33.600 --> 3:34:39.920]  But some of them made mistakes and made public statements outside of Congress when they're
[3:34:39.920 --> 3:34:41.080]  not sitting in their chairs.
[3:34:41.080 --> 3:34:45.920]  So I am forced as I've done with anti-slap suits and other operations to prepare lawsuits.
[3:34:45.920 --> 3:34:53.160]  I've sent the tort letters as of today to them and I've got those letters right here
[3:34:53.160 --> 3:35:00.120]  letting Congressman Dutch and Congressman Raskin know that they are on notice of our
[3:35:00.120 --> 3:35:02.640]  lawsuits.
[3:35:02.640 --> 3:35:07.920]  I don't want to file these lawsuits but I cannot continue to allow them to lie.
[3:35:07.920 --> 3:35:12.800]  They went in with an ADL, Southern Poverty Law Center script, Southern Poverty Law Center
[3:35:12.800 --> 3:35:17.200]  and ADL write a lot of the reports for Soros run media matters and I know word for word
[3:35:17.200 --> 3:35:19.520]  that was media matters.
[3:35:19.520 --> 3:35:27.680]  And they said, Jones says no one died at Parkland in Florida this year, Valentine's Day, my
[3:35:27.680 --> 3:35:32.360]  one of my daughters birthday and that Jones has bullied them.
[3:35:32.360 --> 3:35:34.360]  There's no video, there's no statements.
[3:35:34.360 --> 3:35:39.760]  In the weeks after the shooting, Alex Jones' YouTube channel posted a video that was seen
[3:35:39.760 --> 3:35:46.000]  by 2.3 million subscribers so alleging that these were merely, that these were actors
[3:35:46.000 --> 3:35:51.040]  and not real students who had experienced the most horrific thing anyone could possibly
[3:35:51.040 --> 3:35:52.040]  imagine.
[3:35:52.040 --> 3:35:55.000]  The video violated YouTube's rules against bullying and it was removed.
[3:35:55.000 --> 3:35:59.840]  An article posted to Slate.com describes this as a strike against the channel Ms. Downs.
[3:35:59.840 --> 3:36:04.760]  How many strikes does a channel get?
[3:36:04.760 --> 3:36:08.100]  Typically a channel gets three strikes and then we terminate the channel.
[3:36:08.100 --> 3:36:14.320]  So the reason I ask is Alex Jones obviously is one of the conspiracy theorists whose brand
[3:36:14.320 --> 3:36:15.720]  is bullying.
[3:36:15.720 --> 3:36:21.600]  Their moderators from Bloomberg, from the Southern Poverty Law Center, Bloomberg reported, falsely
[3:36:21.600 --> 3:36:25.560]  made claims that I said nobody died and that I went and bullied them.
[3:36:25.560 --> 3:36:29.840]  David Hogg, a day after the event, started working for the Democratic Party in Soros,
[3:36:29.840 --> 3:36:32.680]  flying around on private jets, being anti-gun spokesperson.
[3:36:32.680 --> 3:36:39.040]  I said he's a PR man and then he was an actor at the school, part of the drama club, so
[3:36:39.040 --> 3:36:42.160]  he's well spoken and he's been chosen to be anti-gun.
[3:36:42.160 --> 3:36:46.520]  I said I believe people died and I believe he's a real student but they misrepresented
[3:36:46.520 --> 3:36:50.800]  it and said that I bullied him and said that nobody died even though he's a public figure.
[3:36:50.800 --> 3:36:53.440]  I would have a right to say that, I didn't say that.
[3:36:53.440 --> 3:36:58.360]  When Alex Jones posted the video you described saying that the survivors of the Parkland
[3:36:58.360 --> 3:37:01.800]  massacre were crisis actors, that violated our harassment policy.
[3:37:01.800 --> 3:37:05.720]  We have a specific policy that says if you say a well-documented violent attack should
[3:37:05.720 --> 3:37:11.760]  happen and you use the name or image of survivors or victims of that attack, that is a malicious
[3:37:11.760 --> 3:37:13.680]  attack and it violates our policy.
[3:37:13.680 --> 3:37:15.960]  I did not post a video doing that.
[3:37:15.960 --> 3:37:16.960]  It was all over the news.
[3:37:16.960 --> 3:37:19.440]  They had to remove all the strikes.
[3:37:19.440 --> 3:37:23.560]  They were putting strikes on videos that I put up showing what I said that I didn't say
[3:37:23.560 --> 3:37:24.560]  it.
[3:37:24.560 --> 3:37:32.840]  You got your ass kicked because I had infowars.com and I had newswars.com and I was able to counter
[3:37:32.840 --> 3:37:36.440]  and show what I said and that's why you're pissed.
[3:37:36.440 --> 3:37:37.960]  She knows this all full well.
[3:37:37.960 --> 3:37:40.160]  It's a huge controversy.
[3:37:40.160 --> 3:37:45.520]  She says, oh we took down, she re-defames me, says it and then it continues.
[3:37:45.520 --> 3:37:46.520]  Here we go.
[3:37:46.520 --> 3:37:51.400]  You just posted the video you described saying that the survivors of the Parkland massacre
[3:37:51.400 --> 3:37:54.280]  were crisis actors, that violated our harassment policy.
[3:37:54.280 --> 3:37:59.040]  They just opened themselves up to defamation but I know she thinks she's in a congressional
[3:37:59.040 --> 3:38:00.040]  hearing and can do it.
[3:38:00.040 --> 3:38:01.200]  I don't even want to sue these people.
[3:38:01.200 --> 3:38:03.560]  Lady, you know who I am, you're obsessed with me.
[3:38:03.560 --> 3:38:09.360]  We have Project Veritas internal videos because I'm the guy that won't sell out.
[3:38:09.360 --> 3:38:11.400]  I'm the guy that stands up against the psychopaths.
[3:38:11.400 --> 3:38:14.080]  You're all just the scared leftists that got controlled by them because you're about to
[3:38:14.080 --> 3:38:20.800]  Stockholm syndrome people so you just defame me again saying Alex Jones posted it and we
[3:38:20.800 --> 3:38:21.800]  took it down.
[3:38:21.800 --> 3:38:25.240]  No, I didn't and you know that.
[3:38:25.240 --> 3:38:26.640]  So here's the deal.
[3:38:26.640 --> 3:38:31.480]  I'm already banned on YouTube, I'm already delisted on Google, I'm already restricted
[3:38:31.480 --> 3:38:36.960]  down to nothing on Twitter and on Facebook and let me give you the big secret.
[3:38:36.960 --> 3:38:41.120]  We never got really new listeners off those.
[3:38:41.120 --> 3:38:46.480]  We never even monetized things, maybe 10%, it was always talk radio and TV and our own
[3:38:46.480 --> 3:38:47.480]  websites.
[3:38:47.480 --> 3:38:48.480]  It's all trash.
[3:38:48.480 --> 3:38:49.480]  It's all bots.
[3:38:49.480 --> 3:38:55.480]  It's all like inflated Zimbabwe currency on Facebook, YouTube and Google and Twitter.
[3:38:55.480 --> 3:38:58.200]  We never even needed you guys.
[3:38:58.200 --> 3:39:04.760]  You though wanting to shut us down and take you off your dirty fake fraudulent platforms
[3:39:04.760 --> 3:39:11.560]  illustrated that we were the zeitgeist and that it created the Streisand effect so now
[3:39:11.560 --> 3:39:14.840]  that you've already stuck your arm in the badger hole that you've already stuck your
[3:39:14.840 --> 3:39:19.960]  cock directly in the wood shipper in the garbage disposal.
[3:39:19.960 --> 3:39:23.160]  Now I'm going to tell you that you just came into a trap.
[3:39:23.160 --> 3:39:30.480]  You dumb trendies that think you're so your families didn't start the country.
[3:39:30.480 --> 3:39:32.760]  Your families weren't involved in Magna Carta.
[3:39:32.760 --> 3:39:35.160]  They didn't die at San Jacena.
[3:39:35.160 --> 3:39:38.360]  They didn't sell their holdings in New York to start Texas and soccer.
[3:39:38.360 --> 3:39:39.760]  They are nothing.
[3:39:39.760 --> 3:39:41.160]  You come from followers.
[3:39:41.160 --> 3:39:43.520]  You are broken.
[3:39:43.520 --> 3:39:51.000]  And now only now will I begin to tell you your destruction.
[3:39:51.000 --> 3:39:52.840]  It's so sweet on your own platforms.
[3:39:52.840 --> 3:39:54.320]  This message is delivered.
[3:39:54.320 --> 3:39:56.640]  It's so luscious.
[3:39:56.640 --> 3:39:58.440]  You the cowards.
[3:39:58.440 --> 3:39:59.440]  You the traders.
[3:39:59.440 --> 3:40:00.880]  You the enemies.
[3:40:00.880 --> 3:40:04.840]  Only now we'll begin to realize you're going to be broken up.
[3:40:04.840 --> 3:40:07.120]  A lot of you are going to go to prison.
[3:40:07.120 --> 3:40:13.200]  Trump has only been letting you have rope like a fish you let run out on that line.
[3:40:13.200 --> 3:40:19.160]  You only hold back to getting tired run deep bitch run hard because when I'm done we're
[3:40:19.160 --> 3:40:24.120]  turning the engines on and I'm getting strapped in and we're hauling your ass in on metal
[3:40:24.120 --> 3:40:29.880]  line and we're going to chop you up on the deck with cold beer on shore and fry your
[3:40:29.880 --> 3:40:35.360]  ass and enjoy you and you will make us strong.
[3:40:35.360 --> 3:40:40.880]  You will feed us cowards but we never start the fight scum.
[3:40:40.880 --> 3:40:46.200]  We only finish it like King George III or Hitler or Harahito get ready to have your
[3:40:46.200 --> 3:40:47.200]  ass handed to you.
[3:40:47.200 --> 3:40:50.960]  Facebook and other tech giants do not want to be in the business of deciding what's true
[3:40:50.960 --> 3:40:51.960]  or what's false.
[3:40:51.960 --> 3:40:52.960]  Right.
[3:40:52.960 --> 3:40:56.640]  They would much rather let the algorithms just, you know, demote really ugly content.
[3:40:56.640 --> 3:40:57.880]  I think that's why I have to make decisions.
[3:40:57.880 --> 3:41:00.640]  Yeah, I think that's why Facebook does not really want to take a position on this.
[3:41:00.640 --> 3:41:04.360]  They don't want to ban them outright because they're afraid that that's going to be seen
[3:41:04.360 --> 3:41:07.960]  as censorship against conservatives and particularly the pro-Chump media.
[3:41:07.960 --> 3:41:13.920]  It does really beg the question, do these tech giants have a responsibility to stem misinformation
[3:41:13.920 --> 3:41:19.480]  online and if it does, does it stop with Jones or does it also go and transfer to other outlets?
[3:41:19.480 --> 3:41:22.960]  How else Jones is going to hear this is going to say, why is CNN out to get me?
[3:41:22.960 --> 3:41:24.360]  Why are you trying to take me down?
[3:41:24.360 --> 3:41:25.360]  Right.
[3:41:25.360 --> 3:41:26.360]  The reaction?
[3:41:26.360 --> 3:41:30.480]  My reaction is I was asking a very simple question at a Facebook event where they said
[3:41:30.480 --> 3:41:34.480]  that they are stemming misinformation online, that they're very serious about combating
[3:41:34.480 --> 3:41:37.880]  misinformation, conspiracy theories and fake news.
[3:41:37.880 --> 3:41:43.360]  And so I think the obvious question is, how can you host the leading purveyor of conspiracy
[3:41:43.360 --> 3:41:47.960]  theories online while claiming simultaneously that you're serious about fighting fake news
[3:41:47.960 --> 3:41:48.960]  on your platform?
[3:41:48.960 --> 3:41:49.960]  That's the question.
[3:41:49.960 --> 3:41:50.960]  Oh, thanks for being here.
[3:41:50.960 --> 3:41:51.960]  Thank you, Brian.
[3:41:51.960 --> 3:41:52.960]  Good to see you.
[3:41:52.960 --> 3:41:58.800]  We're both very authoritarian, very anti-American, very dangerous individuals.
[3:41:58.800 --> 3:42:05.280]  All these people like, God, how did we get this type of people running our eyes?
[3:42:05.280 --> 3:42:08.680]  And do any of us feel safe with this type of crap going on?
[3:42:08.680 --> 3:42:12.720]  Because all I want is free market and American religious freedom and I'm a guy that loves
[3:42:12.720 --> 3:42:13.720]  everybody.
[3:42:13.720 --> 3:42:17.840]  And man, these people lie about me and they cheat and they steal and they engage in fraud
[3:42:17.840 --> 3:42:20.480]  and they piss all over this country.
[3:42:20.480 --> 3:42:23.840]  And everybody just better decide which side they're on.
[3:42:23.840 --> 3:42:27.400]  As for Brian Stelter, Brian, you've been hated since you worked the New York Times.
[3:42:27.400 --> 3:42:28.840]  You're a fraud.
[3:42:28.840 --> 3:42:34.000]  And I pick you out because you are the worst example of humanity.
[3:42:34.000 --> 3:42:37.520]  And you will be defeated.
[3:42:37.520 --> 3:42:40.840]  Smallest victory.
[3:42:40.840 --> 3:42:45.760]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[3:42:45.760 --> 3:42:53.320]  It's Alex Jones.
[3:42:53.320 --> 3:42:57.280]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[3:42:57.280 --> 3:43:01.800]  The real drama can be found here in Lelani Estates, but a lot of us on the Big Island
[3:43:01.800 --> 3:43:07.240]  rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[3:43:07.240 --> 3:43:12.640]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the pH of the water
[3:43:12.640 --> 3:43:14.160]  to unhealthy levels.
[3:43:14.160 --> 3:43:20.720]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity and pH.
[3:43:20.720 --> 3:43:24.680]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity
[3:43:24.680 --> 3:43:26.000]  in the rainwater.
[3:43:26.000 --> 3:43:31.400]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy
[3:43:31.400 --> 3:43:37.480]  metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[3:43:37.480 --> 3:43:42.320]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water.
[3:43:42.320 --> 3:43:47.200]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater
[3:43:47.200 --> 3:43:48.200]  supply.
[3:43:48.200 --> 3:43:53.000]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[3:43:53.000 --> 3:43:59.360]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging
[3:43:59.360 --> 3:44:05.760]  listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books
[3:44:05.760 --> 3:44:13.000]  or videos or other material from infowarstore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[3:44:13.000 --> 3:44:15.200]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[3:44:15.200 --> 3:44:18.920]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at infowarstore.com.
[3:44:18.920 --> 3:44:22.560]  I don't want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste

[3:44:31.520 --> 3:44:34.720]  That's my dad with colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[3:44:34.720 --> 3:44:38.640]  That's our doctor's-life.com or 808-253-3139.

[3:44:47.000 --> 3:44:48.520]  And they know we know who they are.
[3:44:48.520 --> 3:44:58.200]  And they're coming back against us, so we need your support.

[3:46:09.500 --> 3:46:11.860]  and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[3:46:11.860 --> 3:46:13.900]  It is well known in traditional medicine

[3:47:05.660 --> 3:47:09.060]  They are openly attempting to start proxy wars
[3:47:09.060 --> 3:47:11.700]  between the United States and Russia
[3:47:11.700 --> 3:47:13.740]  and the countries surrounding Russia
[3:47:13.740 --> 3:47:18.140]  from Central Asia into Southern and Central Europe.
[3:47:18.140 --> 3:47:21.940]  Bernie Sanders introduced a nightmare resolution
[3:47:21.940 --> 3:47:25.020]  that had Republican and Democrat support in the Senate
[3:47:25.020 --> 3:47:27.260]  and would have passed.
[3:47:27.260 --> 3:47:29.180]  It's being reported by Reuters
[3:47:29.180 --> 3:47:33.820]  that he had the overwhelming votes to pass the resolution.
[3:47:33.820 --> 3:47:38.820]  Some estimates were it would be 9921.
[3:47:40.140 --> 3:47:43.420]  But thanks to the rules in the Senate,
[3:47:43.420 --> 3:47:45.540]  Rand Paul was able to block it.
[3:47:45.540 --> 3:47:46.860]  Listen to this.
[3:47:46.860 --> 3:47:49.540]  Rand Paul blocks Bernie Sanders' resolution
[3:47:49.540 --> 3:47:53.420]  demanding more Russia sanctions.
[3:47:53.420 --> 3:47:55.380]  Paul objected to the resolution,
[3:47:55.380 --> 3:47:58.140]  saying it was a sign of Trump derangement syndrome
[3:47:58.140 --> 3:47:59.940]  coming to the Senate.
[3:47:59.940 --> 3:48:01.460]  Senator Rand Paul on Thursday
[3:48:01.460 --> 3:48:03.300]  had blocked a resolution from Senator Bernie Sanders
[3:48:03.300 --> 3:48:05.860]  to implement even more sanctions against Russia,
[3:48:05.860 --> 3:48:09.340]  demanding Trump speak with special counsel Robert Mueller
[3:48:09.340 --> 3:48:12.020]  and back the intelligence community assessment
[3:48:12.020 --> 3:48:15.180]  on imaginary Ruski meddling.
[3:48:15.180 --> 3:48:17.220]  Now, back that up a moment.
[3:48:17.220 --> 3:48:22.220]  Compel the executive branch
[3:48:22.260 --> 3:48:25.020]  to speak to their own supposed employee.
[3:48:25.900 --> 3:48:28.380]  That is so unconstitutional, but it gets worse.
[3:48:28.380 --> 3:48:29.940]  In the full resolution,
[3:48:29.940 --> 3:48:34.460]  it would install Rod Rosenstein as a co-president,
[3:48:34.460 --> 3:48:38.580]  giving him presidential powers in the Justice Department.
[3:48:38.580 --> 3:48:42.460]  And Congress would basically take over the executive branch
[3:48:42.460 --> 3:48:47.060]  and install Rosenstein like a new pope or something.
[3:48:47.060 --> 3:48:49.820]  I mean, this is a real attempted coup.
[3:48:49.820 --> 3:48:53.380]  Now, you notice Rosenstein changed the order of succession
[3:48:53.380 --> 3:48:55.020]  and power in the Justice Department
[3:48:56.500 --> 3:48:58.820]  so that he was in control of the Justice Department
[3:48:58.820 --> 3:49:00.500]  and then tricked Trump into signing it
[3:49:00.500 --> 3:49:02.620]  in his first month in office.
[3:49:02.620 --> 3:49:05.540]  Back when he thought McCabe and all of them were being fair.
[3:49:05.540 --> 3:49:07.980]  Now we all know the truth, they're a cabal of Democrats.
[3:49:07.980 --> 3:49:10.380]  So think about all of this.
[3:49:10.380 --> 3:49:11.700]  This is so crazy.
[3:49:11.700 --> 3:49:13.820]  And that's a whole separate issue
[3:49:13.820 --> 3:49:16.420]  from how they're trying to start war with Russia
[3:49:16.420 --> 3:49:18.380]  and how the left is foaming at the mouth for it
[3:49:18.380 --> 3:49:20.380]  along with the neo-cons.
[3:49:20.380 --> 3:49:22.300]  Sanders asked for unanimous consent
[3:49:22.300 --> 3:49:24.500]  to try to pass a resolution saying,
[3:49:24.500 --> 3:49:27.020]  we must act if they are serious
[3:49:27.020 --> 3:49:30.060]  about preserving American democracy.
[3:49:30.060 --> 3:49:31.940]  The Congress must make it clear
[3:49:31.940 --> 3:49:36.020]  that we accept the assessment of our intelligence community
[3:49:36.020 --> 3:49:38.300]  with regard to Russian election interference
[3:49:38.300 --> 3:49:40.860]  in our country and our democracy.
[3:49:40.860 --> 3:49:44.580]  Sanders said during the Senate floor speech,
[3:49:44.580 --> 3:49:47.100]  he's like, let's just hear from you now.
[3:49:47.100 --> 3:49:50.060]  What this resolution says is when I tell Russia,
[3:49:50.060 --> 3:49:53.580]  stop interfering in our elections.
[3:49:53.580 --> 3:49:57.540]  What this resolution is about is to tell Russia
[3:49:57.540 --> 3:50:00.580]  to stop interfering with democratic countries
[3:50:00.580 --> 3:50:03.340]  all over the world in their elections.
[3:50:03.340 --> 3:50:06.220]  What this resolution is about is saying
[3:50:06.220 --> 3:50:09.460]  that we should implement the sanctions overwhelmingly
[3:50:09.460 --> 3:50:11.420]  voted by Congress.
[3:50:11.420 --> 3:50:16.420]  What this resolution is about is that we will not accept
[3:50:16.420 --> 3:50:19.740]  interference with the ongoing investigation
[3:50:19.740 --> 3:50:22.300]  of special counsel Robert Mueller
[3:50:22.300 --> 3:50:25.300]  and that what this resolution says
[3:50:25.300 --> 3:50:27.340]  is the president must cooperate
[3:50:27.340 --> 3:50:29.940]  with the investigation of Mr. Mueller.
[3:50:29.940 --> 3:50:32.500]  That's what this resolution is about.
[3:50:33.460 --> 3:50:37.580]  Under the Senate rules, any one senator could block his request.
[3:50:37.580 --> 3:50:40.100]  Sanders' resolution would also demand
[3:50:40.100 --> 3:50:42.420]  already passed sanctions legislation
[3:50:42.420 --> 3:50:46.660]  be fully implemented even to protect the election system
[3:50:46.660 --> 3:50:50.500]  and to not accept interference in Mueller's investigation,
[3:50:50.500 --> 3:50:53.420]  including the firing of deputy attorney general,
[3:50:53.420 --> 3:50:54.980]  Rod Rosenstein.
[3:50:54.980 --> 3:50:56.420]  So if we'll let the Homeland Security,
[3:50:56.420 --> 3:50:59.020]  Roma Democrats take over the election process
[3:50:59.020 --> 3:51:00.420]  and all 50 states, attorney generals,
[3:51:00.420 --> 3:51:01.660]  remember they tried that,
[3:51:01.660 --> 3:51:03.140]  and you've got to let Rod Rosenstein
[3:51:03.140 --> 3:51:04.420]  be the new deputy president,
[3:51:04.420 --> 3:51:07.220]  basically the king, I guess co-president,
[3:51:07.220 --> 3:51:10.220]  and you just got to do whatever the senator says.
[3:51:10.220 --> 3:51:11.940]  But Paul objected to the resolution.
[3:51:11.940 --> 3:51:13.820]  We're gonna play it in a moment.
[3:51:13.820 --> 3:51:17.060]  Second was a sign of Trump derangement syndrome
[3:51:17.060 --> 3:51:18.700]  coming to the Senate.
[3:51:18.700 --> 3:51:21.740]  Paul has been one of Trump's most vocal defenders
[3:51:21.740 --> 3:51:24.300]  in Congress in the wake of the president's sit-down
[3:51:24.300 --> 3:51:27.060]  with President Putin earlier this week.
[3:51:27.060 --> 3:51:29.340]  Here he is, Senator Rand Paul.
[3:51:30.420 --> 3:51:32.260]  Trump derangement syndrome
[3:51:32.260 --> 3:51:34.860]  has officially come to the Senate.
[3:51:34.860 --> 3:51:38.700]  The hatred for the president is so intense
[3:51:38.700 --> 3:51:41.820]  that partisans would rather risk war
[3:51:41.820 --> 3:51:44.540]  than give diplomacy a chance.
[3:51:44.540 --> 3:51:46.700]  Does anybody remember that Ronald Reagan
[3:51:46.700 --> 3:51:47.900]  sat down with Gorbachev
[3:51:47.900 --> 3:51:50.380]  and we lessened the nuclear tensions?
[3:51:50.380 --> 3:51:53.020]  We need to still have those openings.
[3:51:53.020 --> 3:51:55.220]  Nobody is saying or excusing
[3:51:55.220 --> 3:51:57.020]  Russia's meddling in our elections.
[3:51:57.020 --> 3:51:58.420]  Absolutely.
[3:51:58.420 --> 3:52:02.100]  We should protect the integrity of our elections.
[3:52:02.100 --> 3:52:05.020]  But simply bringing the hatred of the president
[3:52:05.020 --> 3:52:07.420]  to the Senate floor in order to say
[3:52:07.420 --> 3:52:09.220]  we're done with diplomacy,
[3:52:09.220 --> 3:52:12.380]  we're going to add more sanctions and more sanctions.
[3:52:12.380 --> 3:52:13.740]  You know what?
[3:52:13.740 --> 3:52:15.620]  I would rather that we still have
[3:52:15.620 --> 3:52:18.980]  open channels of discussion with the Russians.
[3:52:18.980 --> 3:52:21.860]  Kennedy, at the height of the Cold War,
[3:52:21.860 --> 3:52:23.940]  had a direct line to Khrushchev
[3:52:23.940 --> 3:52:26.620]  and it may have prevented the end of the world.
[3:52:26.620 --> 3:52:30.020]  Should we be so crazy about partisanship
[3:52:30.020 --> 3:52:32.820]  that we now say we don't want to talk to the Russians?
[3:52:32.820 --> 3:52:35.260]  We're not going to have relations with the Russians.
[3:52:35.260 --> 3:52:37.580]  We should stand firm and say
[3:52:37.580 --> 3:52:39.820]  stay the hell out of our elections,
[3:52:39.820 --> 3:52:42.620]  but we should not stick our head in the ground
[3:52:42.620 --> 3:52:45.260]  and say we're not going to talk to them.
[3:52:45.260 --> 3:52:47.820]  I would like to see the Russians leave Ukraine.
[3:52:47.820 --> 3:52:49.780]  I think we could do it through diplomacy.
[3:52:49.780 --> 3:52:52.140]  We're not going to have it if we don't talk to them.
[3:52:52.140 --> 3:52:53.380]  I would like to see the Russians
[3:52:53.380 --> 3:52:54.780]  help more with North Korea
[3:52:54.780 --> 3:52:57.100]  with denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.
[3:52:57.100 --> 3:52:58.620]  We're not going to have it
[3:52:58.620 --> 3:53:01.020]  if we just simply heat more sanctions on
[3:53:01.020 --> 3:53:03.100]  and say we're not going to talk to the Russians
[3:53:03.100 --> 3:53:05.020]  and anybody that talks to the Russians
[3:53:05.020 --> 3:53:06.380]  has committed treason.
[3:53:06.380 --> 3:53:09.940]  For goodness sakes, we have the former head of the CIA,
[3:53:09.940 --> 3:53:13.420]  John Brennan, gallivanting across TV,
[3:53:13.420 --> 3:53:16.140]  now being paid for his opinion
[3:53:16.140 --> 3:53:18.700]  to call the president treasonous.
[3:53:18.700 --> 3:53:20.060]  This has got to stop.
[3:53:20.060 --> 3:53:22.580]  This is crazy hatred of the president.
[3:53:22.580 --> 3:53:26.140]  This is crazy partisanship that is driving this.
[3:53:26.140 --> 3:53:28.580]  So I could not object more strongly to this,
[3:53:28.580 --> 3:53:29.980]  Mr. President, I object.
[3:53:29.980 --> 3:53:33.700]  Yes, it is Trump derangement syndrome indeed.
[3:53:33.700 --> 3:53:37.060]  Don't forget, slimy Sanders earlier on
[3:53:37.060 --> 3:53:40.700]  was the only other person that voted last year
[3:53:40.700 --> 3:53:43.580]  with Rand Paul to not expand these sanctions.
[3:53:43.580 --> 3:53:45.580]  These are acts of war.
[3:53:45.580 --> 3:53:47.580]  The West has been messing with Russian elections
[3:53:47.580 --> 3:53:49.300]  for decades.
[3:53:49.300 --> 3:53:51.420]  The West, funded by George Soros,
[3:53:51.420 --> 3:53:53.940]  overthrew Ukraine, started this whole thing.
[3:53:53.940 --> 3:53:56.700]  Russia came and helped us defeat ISIS.
[3:53:56.700 --> 3:53:59.020]  Russia faces the same globalist enemies
[3:53:59.020 --> 3:54:00.900]  and there's no reason we should allow
[3:54:00.900 --> 3:54:03.460]  the neocons, Hollywood, the mainstream media
[3:54:03.460 --> 3:54:05.580]  and all the rest of these globalist operations
[3:54:05.580 --> 3:54:07.500]  like the Pope and the China comms
[3:54:07.500 --> 3:54:10.060]  to manipulate us into a real war
[3:54:10.060 --> 3:54:11.660]  or a proxy war with Russia.
[3:54:11.660 --> 3:54:13.580]  This is against our interests, it's insane.
[3:54:13.580 --> 3:54:16.100]  Russia is not our enemy, that's just a fact,
[3:54:16.100 --> 3:54:17.460]  if they were, I'd expose it.
[3:54:17.460 --> 3:54:19.380]  It is China that owns our debt.
[3:54:19.380 --> 3:54:21.180]  China that's infiltrated our universities.
[3:54:21.180 --> 3:54:23.020]  China that has bought up Hollywood.
[3:54:23.020 --> 3:54:25.540]  China that is fomenting all this leftist garbage
[3:54:25.540 --> 3:54:28.340]  and went to Davos, their dictator a year and a half ago
[3:54:28.340 --> 3:54:29.900]  and said, I will defeat Trump.
[3:54:29.900 --> 3:54:31.140]  I will work with Juncker.
[3:54:31.140 --> 3:54:32.500]  I will work with the EU.
[3:54:32.500 --> 3:54:35.700]  We are basically unstoppable.
[3:54:35.700 --> 3:54:37.940]  So that's the reality, ladies and gentlemen
[3:54:37.940 --> 3:54:42.780]  and that's where we stand as a society, as a culture
[3:54:42.780 --> 3:54:46.220]  and it's simply insane that we've now gotten to this point
[3:54:46.220 --> 3:54:49.140]  because despite Paul blocking this Mitch McConnell
[3:54:49.140 --> 3:54:54.140]  a combined is going to try to pass it in the house
[3:54:55.060 --> 3:54:57.020]  and then force it back into the Senate
[3:54:57.020 --> 3:54:58.940]  and then Paul won't be able to block it.
[3:54:58.940 --> 3:55:00.980]  So this is where our country is going.
[3:55:00.980 --> 3:55:02.540]  I think we should call Mitch McConnell
[3:55:02.540 --> 3:55:04.140]  and Paul Ryan, all the rest of these guys and say,
[3:55:04.140 --> 3:55:05.940]  hey, why don't you do something about the office
[3:55:05.940 --> 3:55:07.260]  of personal management hack
[3:55:07.260 --> 3:55:09.340]  that was given to China by Obama?
[3:55:09.340 --> 3:55:11.300]  The ultimate reason, why don't you do something
[3:55:11.300 --> 3:55:14.500]  about the $900 billion trade deficit with China?
[3:55:14.500 --> 3:55:16.780]  Why don't you do something about all those issues
[3:55:16.780 --> 3:55:19.740]  that have destroyed this country and our industrial base
[3:55:19.740 --> 3:55:21.820]  and annihilated our national security
[3:55:21.820 --> 3:55:23.940]  instead of showboating and grandstanding
[3:55:23.940 --> 3:55:25.940]  and dogpiling the president claiming
[3:55:25.940 --> 3:55:27.420]  that he's a Russian agent
[3:55:27.420 --> 3:55:29.780]  because all he did was go after a year and a half
[3:55:29.780 --> 3:55:32.860]  and had an overdue meeting with President Putin
[3:55:32.860 --> 3:55:34.940]  about working on security issues,
[3:55:34.940 --> 3:55:37.680]  fighting ISIS and al-Qaeda and so many other things.
[3:55:37.680 --> 3:55:40.700]  This is unbelievable to see the traders,
[3:55:40.700 --> 3:55:42.660]  to see the globalists in both parties
[3:55:42.660 --> 3:55:45.020]  desperate to keep this country under their control,
[3:55:45.020 --> 3:55:47.660]  pointing their finger at patriots across this country
[3:55:47.660 --> 3:55:50.380]  like myself, Roger Stone and many others
[3:55:50.380 --> 3:55:51.420]  and the American voters,
[3:55:51.420 --> 3:55:53.820]  they point their finger at American voters
[3:55:53.820 --> 3:55:56.540]  and they say, you didn't elect President Trump,
[3:55:56.540 --> 3:55:58.580]  you didn't decide to say no to Hillary Clinton,
[3:55:58.580 --> 3:56:01.180]  no, you are controlled by Putin,
[3:56:01.180 --> 3:56:03.500]  you are mind controlled by a country
[3:56:03.500 --> 3:56:06.540]  that again, can't even hardly keep its own nation running.
[3:56:06.540 --> 3:56:09.900]  This is an insult and a slap in the face of America
[3:56:09.900 --> 3:56:11.140]  and Americans see through it,
[3:56:11.140 --> 3:56:12.940]  there's gallop polls out showing
[3:56:12.940 --> 3:56:14.740]  that hardly anybody even cares about Russia,
[3:56:14.740 --> 3:56:17.380]  they're so sick of it, they know it's a fraud.
[3:56:17.380 --> 3:56:19.060]  But the craze left us love it
[3:56:19.060 --> 3:56:21.580]  because they're gonna use it to take over American elections,
[3:56:21.580 --> 3:56:23.140]  they're gonna use it to federalize things
[3:56:23.140 --> 3:56:24.180]  if they can remove Trump,
[3:56:24.180 --> 3:56:25.940]  to overturn the 2016 election
[3:56:25.940 --> 3:56:29.460]  and then bring in an iron grip of control over this nation
[3:56:29.460 --> 3:56:31.380]  so we never have real elections again.
[3:56:31.380 --> 3:56:32.580]  They know they're beaten,
[3:56:32.580 --> 3:56:35.060]  they know they've been stopped fair and square,
[3:56:35.060 --> 3:56:36.740]  they know there's been a political realignment
[3:56:36.740 --> 3:56:39.020]  and they are now scared to death
[3:56:39.020 --> 3:56:41.400]  and trying to bring in a final tyranny,
[3:56:41.400 --> 3:56:44.220]  a final revolution against the American people.
[3:56:44.220 --> 3:56:47.300]  So this is the fight for this country, make no mistake,
[3:56:47.300 --> 3:56:48.820]  this isn't like other elections.
[3:56:48.820 --> 3:56:50.460]  And a lot of people are asleep out there,
[3:56:50.460 --> 3:56:52.500]  you need to get awake and understand
[3:56:52.500 --> 3:56:54.340]  that their attacks on free speech,
[3:56:54.340 --> 3:56:56.060]  Trump supporters, the president,
[3:56:56.060 --> 3:56:57.620]  their calls for his assassination
[3:56:57.620 --> 3:57:00.500]  are exponentially, logarithmically increasing
[3:57:00.500 --> 3:57:03.060]  and they're making their move this late summer
[3:57:03.060 --> 3:57:05.620]  into the fall, they admit they're making their move.
[3:57:05.620 --> 3:57:07.780]  That's why the censorship has been ratcheted up,
[3:57:07.780 --> 3:57:09.900]  that's why the president's been shadow banned on Twitter,
[3:57:09.900 --> 3:57:11.300]  he must speak out against it,
[3:57:11.300 --> 3:57:12.940]  that's why you must speak out against it,
[3:57:12.940 --> 3:57:15.060]  that's why we've got to get totally motivated
[3:57:15.060 --> 3:57:17.860]  and ring the alarm bells as modern Paul reveres.
[3:57:17.860 --> 3:57:20.060]  I'm Alex Jones, back to live transmission
[3:57:20.060 --> 3:57:22.100]  with Owen Schreuer from the ATX.

[3:57:23.720 --> 3:57:25.620]  and tell folks about the station you're listening to.

[3:57:27.420 --> 3:57:30.140]  With your help and action, we will be victorious

[3:57:36.940 --> 3:57:39.100]  born and domestic.
[3:57:39.100 --> 3:57:44.100]  It's Alex Jones.
[3:57:44.100 --> 3:57:47.500]  Patrick, in the great nation of Australia,
[3:57:47.500 --> 3:57:49.260]  you're on the air worldwide, thanks for holding.
[3:57:49.260 --> 3:57:50.660]  Hey, Alex, mate.
[3:57:50.660 --> 3:57:54.260]  I've been following you since I was 14 and I'm 32 now.
[3:57:54.260 --> 3:57:57.020]  I remember back when Info Wars and Prison Planet,
[3:57:57.020 --> 3:57:59.380]  it was just blue text on a white screen
[3:57:59.380 --> 3:58:02.420]  and it had to load down the page on my dial up internet
[3:58:02.420 --> 3:58:03.740]  and I thought it was pretty cool
[3:58:03.740 --> 3:58:06.300]  and read all the books and seen all the DVDs
[3:58:06.300 --> 3:58:07.540]  and followed all your guests
[3:58:07.540 --> 3:58:10.180]  and I've been using your product since the first iteration
[3:58:10.180 --> 3:58:13.140]  of Survival Shield and since then I'm on the X2,
[3:58:13.140 --> 3:58:16.780]  the Super Male Vitality, the Caveman, the Real Red Pill,
[3:58:16.780 --> 3:58:19.220]  Michael ZX body, it's all amazing.
[3:58:19.220 --> 3:58:20.060]  Thank you, brother.
[3:58:20.060 --> 3:58:23.020]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much,
[3:58:23.020 --> 3:58:25.500]  it's like you're just detoxing the mind,
[3:58:25.500 --> 3:58:28.380]  you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit
[3:58:28.380 --> 3:58:30.300]  and it's just the more you know God,
[3:58:30.300 --> 3:58:33.220]  the more you fear God, but the more you chase God
[3:58:33.220 --> 3:58:36.180]  and I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side
[3:58:36.180 --> 3:58:38.580]  with you, the crew and the listeners out there,

[3:58:47.020 --> 3:58:48.540]  as staying healthy at home,
[3:58:48.540 --> 3:58:51.260]  but sometimes supplements don't work fast enough.
