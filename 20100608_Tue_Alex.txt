[00:00.000 --> 00:13.600]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex
[00:13.600 --> 00:20.760]  Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.760 --> 00:36.080]  I was on coast to coast AM last night in the first hour and George Norrie asked me
[00:36.080 --> 00:41.880]  what I thought about the BP spill and I told him that all the evidence points
[00:41.880 --> 00:48.040]  towards a false flag attack and I've got Paul Watson and Steve Watson working
[00:48.040 --> 00:55.120]  the last week researching the oil spill the definitive report now 40 plus days
[00:55.120 --> 01:00.160]  after we'll be published in the next two hours at prisonplanet.com we've all
[01:00.160 --> 01:05.200]  been working on it together it's not a hundred percent that it's staged but all
[01:05.200 --> 01:10.000]  the evidence points towards it being staged and it is a hundred percent that
[01:10.000 --> 01:15.600]  they are allowing it to continue and that they want it to be a bigger disaster as
[01:15.600 --> 01:20.600]  a pretext as the Washington Post reported last week for Obama to pass his
[01:20.600 --> 01:28.080]  new carbon tax a wellhead tax a gas pump tax a energy tax all levied in the
[01:28.080 --> 01:32.920]  name of cleaning up the Gulf and they're not letting the public witness what's
[01:32.920 --> 01:36.120]  happening they're not letting people in Louisiana Mississippi and Florida put up
[01:36.120 --> 01:43.720]  their own sand berms or their own systems to block the oil from going in to
[01:43.720 --> 01:48.840]  the estuaries into the brackish water areas with the rivers and streams enter
[01:48.840 --> 01:53.000]  the mangrove swamps where it's most destructive to the fisheries and the
[01:53.000 --> 01:57.080]  communities the feds are a bunch of control freaks and they're in there
[01:57.080 --> 02:01.360]  accentuating the crisis as much as they can and I'm not the only one saying it
[02:01.360 --> 02:07.520]  many other analysts across the border saying look Obama wants to nationalize
[02:07.520 --> 02:13.800]  the oil companies and the big top mega bps exxon mobiles and others they're
[02:13.800 --> 02:17.000]  already nationalized they're already owned by the big central banks that are
[02:17.000 --> 02:22.320]  the global government that's merged with our national government and their
[02:22.320 --> 02:28.000]  specialty is doing things to themselves and then having presidents prime
[02:28.000 --> 02:33.440]  ministers CEOs fall on their swords but then the power structure expands its
[02:33.440 --> 02:39.320]  control remember Katrina day one it turned out FEMA had done drills of cutting
[02:39.320 --> 02:43.080]  off the cell phones cutting off the police radios not allowing aid to come
[02:43.080 --> 02:47.200]  in then when they actually had Katrina hit they did that they cut the cell phone
[02:47.200 --> 02:51.840]  towers cut the police control towers wouldn't let local police or even the
[02:51.840 --> 02:56.680]  National Guard at the beginning or the Coast Guard or Walmart come in and help
[02:56.680 --> 03:01.960]  people said why why why why four five six days no food or water stacking it up
[03:01.960 --> 03:06.360]  not giving it to people inside the astro dome why not let people walk out of
[03:06.360 --> 03:11.800]  the high and dry highways out to other areas because it was all a laboratory a
[03:11.800 --> 03:18.040]  test an experiment a drill the Pentagon calls Iraq a laboratory they call when
[03:18.040 --> 03:21.480]  they have military drills in the US a laboratory they call Afghanistan a
[03:21.480 --> 03:26.080]  laboratory they're now injecting police with steroids all over the nation
[03:26.080 --> 03:30.440]  publicly a few years ago it was the big secret that a third or more cops were on
[03:30.440 --> 03:34.960]  it now they're putting them on speed the military's on steroids and amnesics and
[03:34.960 --> 03:41.160]  hallucinogens and mind control drugs now publicly it's all a giant experiment
[03:41.160 --> 03:47.120]  this is a scientific dictatorship the globalists don't care about celebrity
[03:47.120 --> 03:50.400]  and about looking like winners they want to be winners they want to be
[03:50.400 --> 03:56.440]  controllers they feed you issues and distractions and things that don't
[03:56.440 --> 03:59.000]  matter because yeah they're gonna get a carbon tax out of this at least that's
[03:59.000 --> 04:04.240]  their goal they're gonna get more control over onshore drilling they've
[04:04.240 --> 04:13.840]  already had a total ban on already permitted wells in the Gulf and now
[04:13.840 --> 04:23.480]  they're gonna use it to nationalize to a greater extent our energy system because
[04:23.480 --> 04:26.520]  there are so many wildcats and independent groups out there producing
[04:26.520 --> 04:31.760]  oil in this country they want to shut them down the monopoly list want to
[04:31.760 --> 04:36.400]  shut it down but here is the most important point of all of this when we
[04:36.400 --> 04:45.000]  get back the most important key overarching reason that bare minimum they
[04:45.000 --> 04:51.640]  are not letting the full scope of the disaster be known a and be allowing it
[04:51.640 --> 04:56.280]  to continue doing everything they can I mean we know they're blocking known
[04:56.280 --> 05:01.760]  fix this we'll be back let me tell you a little bit about one of our great

[06:59.880 --> 07:03.640]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number
[07:03.640 --> 07:07.400]  one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[07:07.400 --> 07:11.920]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[07:11.920 --> 07:15.480]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[07:15.480 --> 07:19.840]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[07:19.840 --> 07:24.160]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[07:24.160 --> 07:27.920]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[07:27.920 --> 07:32.040]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[07:32.040 --> 07:36.040]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[07:36.040 --> 07:39.840]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[07:39.840 --> 07:42.560]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[07:42.560 --> 07:48.520]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com
[07:48.520 --> 07:53.200]  that's my solar backup.com remember the government doesn't own the Sun so go to
[07:53.200 --> 08:01.520]  my solar backup.com or call 1-877-327-0365 the Genesis Communications
[08:01.520 --> 08:07.280]  radio network proudly presents the Alex Jones show because there's a war on for
[08:07.280 --> 08:15.400]  your mind well we have clear incontrovertible evidence of pre-positioning
[08:15.400 --> 08:21.560]  of financial assets to profit the globalist in the week before the oil
[08:21.560 --> 08:27.440]  spill up again a month and a half ago we have absolutely crystal clear evidence
[08:27.440 --> 08:38.600]  of that namely Halliburton bought up a oil spill company a week before that
[08:38.600 --> 08:45.680]  operates in the Gulf Halliburton had the contract with a subcontractor on the
[08:45.680 --> 08:53.960]  Deepwater horizon out in the Gulf of Mexico you have the CEO of Goldman Sachs
[08:53.960 --> 09:01.040]  chief Tony Hayward selling his shares a record amount of shares in the weeks
[09:01.040 --> 09:09.000]  before the oil spill over a third of his shares you have Goldman Sachs and we
[09:09.000 --> 09:13.800]  heard rumors of this at the time but now it's confirmed via federal trade
[09:13.800 --> 09:23.720]  Commission filings for your request done by raw story and it reports that 4,680,822
[09:23.720 --> 09:28.080]  shares are 44% but then I went and did some research was actually that was one
[09:28.080 --> 09:32.840]  of the dumps were two days before a day before they dumped some more so it was
[09:32.840 --> 09:38.800]  over 50% total of the Goldman Sachs stock in British petroleum that was
[09:38.800 --> 09:47.880]  riding high at the time this oil well of 3000 plus us licensed oil wells 3000
[09:47.880 --> 09:52.600]  plus you know look it up we're not the actual number in front is 3,300 and
[09:52.600 --> 09:58.280]  something the point is over 3000 us licensed oil rigs in the Gulf and out
[09:58.280 --> 10:02.800]  of 3000 plus a safety video was shot for the White House and about
[10:02.800 --> 10:10.040]  environmentalism and Obama gave one award to that oil rig you have BP being
[10:10.040 --> 10:13.840]  the top globalist oil company Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands one of the
[10:13.840 --> 10:18.600]  big owners as well as Dutch roll shell those two companies are partnered the
[10:18.600 --> 10:22.400]  Queen of England owns a large portion of British petroleum of course British
[10:22.400 --> 10:30.400]  petroleum is allowed to get 80% under government agreements since the 70s of
[10:30.400 --> 10:35.200]  the oil that comes out of Alaska you're only allowed to have one pipeline of the
[10:35.200 --> 10:42.400]  US the rest is all sent to Japan and China see it's all a cartel it's all
[10:42.400 --> 10:47.760]  rigged we have one of the most controlled energy industries in the world
[10:47.760 --> 10:55.440]  because the Rockefellers didn't discover oil but within months of it being
[10:55.440 --> 10:58.880]  discovered they discovered the way to create a monopoly and to bring it to
[10:58.880 --> 11:05.360]  market and so I was the United States that created the oil industry worldwide
[11:05.360 --> 11:10.000]  it was the Rockefellers and they created the monopoly in the 1906 they got
[11:10.000 --> 11:16.680]  their supposed monopoly busted up into what was it eight different major oil
[11:16.680 --> 11:24.400]  companies those later split into several more up to 12 and then 14 but the
[11:24.400 --> 11:30.320]  Rockefellers of this day are tax exempt oh they owe the public sure busted up the
[11:30.320 --> 11:35.840]  trust see back then trust were known as mega monopolies so they spun and they
[11:35.840 --> 11:41.880]  said well we'll have a new trust we'll be tax exempt and we'll break up our
[11:41.880 --> 11:47.720]  companies and divest our control of them which didn't really happen and so then
[11:47.720 --> 11:53.760]  they could have 14 different oil companies not just standard oil and jack up
[11:53.760 --> 11:57.960]  the prices on you it's the same thing with diamonds same thing with water same
[11:57.960 --> 12:02.000]  thing with timber same thing with three big companies controlling almost all of
[12:02.000 --> 12:07.680]  the corn and wheat and soybeans and canola and they're busy mopping up they
[12:07.680 --> 12:11.080]  write the federal like regulations to shut down their competition and if they
[12:11.080 --> 12:16.320]  need to stage a crisis to consolidate power that they're going to do it and
[12:16.320 --> 12:20.960]  they cover all their bases why do you think that BP and archer Daniels
[12:20.960 --> 12:24.880]  meddling company and the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds and the UN they all
[12:24.880 --> 12:32.360]  have gone in together on no fewer than 50 plus emergency underground guarded by
[12:32.360 --> 12:38.920]  by machine gun nest and pillboxes seed vaults oh yeah there's seed vaults in
[12:38.920 --> 12:44.680]  the US India England Russia Japan are guarded by armed guards now at the
[12:44.680 --> 12:48.440]  North Pole they've got quite a few of these installations they don't need to
[12:48.440 --> 12:52.000]  because there are hundreds of miles from even the smallest town and how our
[12:52.000 --> 12:58.480]  giant iron fortress doors you can just go to YouTube and type in Arctic seed
[12:58.480 --> 13:04.680]  vault and you can watch the newscast big giant armored doors that it take a
[13:04.680 --> 13:09.800]  hundred pounds of C4 to get into those are the only ones that aren't guarded
[13:09.800 --> 13:17.200]  they don't need to guard them okay so they're guarding original non hybrid
[13:17.200 --> 13:22.120]  non GMO seeds in fortresses because they're going to infect everything in
[13:22.120 --> 13:26.240]  fact we've even seen them brag about this the big GMO companies they're going
[13:26.240 --> 13:31.640]  to infect every major seed line of every food crop and it is then going to come
[13:31.640 --> 13:34.880]  out in the news later that it's sterilizing everyone on the earth and
[13:34.880 --> 13:37.760]  they're going to say it's an accident and they're going to admit that it's
[13:37.760 --> 13:41.200]  jumping into other species of plants and insect and animal because they're
[13:41.200 --> 13:48.160]  mixing mammal and insect and other reptile genes into fish into other mammals
[13:48.160 --> 13:53.280]  into major food staples and they knew from day one that they can make the
[13:53.280 --> 13:57.520]  desired change but then it randomly then creates other mutations and that they
[13:57.520 --> 14:03.440]  suddenly got oak trees growing growing corn you know out of their seed buds in
[14:03.440 --> 14:08.320]  the spring I mean it's just an absolute nightmare they're polluting and
[14:08.320 --> 14:12.040]  destroying everything and you're not going to hear one stinking environmental
[14:12.040 --> 14:16.960]  group ever talk about the real environmental holocaust and red level
[14:16.960 --> 14:23.240]  emergency going on everywhere no no you're gonna have BP and the UN say
[14:23.240 --> 14:27.960]  we're gonna tax carbon that humans exhale and I pointed out that's a war on
[14:27.960 --> 14:32.720]  the carbon cycle and a war on humanity and all human activity and I said you
[14:32.720 --> 14:36.840]  watch they're gonna admit it's meant to target humans as a tax and then Bill
[14:36.840 --> 14:40.920]  Gates and the UN the last three months they all come out and say yeah humans are
[14:40.920 --> 14:45.320]  the problem we can't just cut our other carbon footprint we got to cut humans
[14:45.320 --> 14:55.280]  and the average soft lazy decadent yuppie who's weak and pathetic we'll say
[14:55.280 --> 14:58.760]  well we do have to get rid of the Africans or the Latin Americans or the
[14:58.760 --> 15:02.800]  Asians there are too many of them hey those people are ten times harder
[15:02.800 --> 15:06.760]  working than you are they didn't have the ancestors that set up the republic
[15:06.760 --> 15:13.080]  that produced all this wealth so you could become decadent slobs they
[15:13.080 --> 15:17.480]  understand more and more what they're up against and let me explain something to
[15:17.480 --> 15:22.720]  you you are the target of this new world order eugenics you slack jaw dim-eyed
[15:22.720 --> 15:28.120]  weak you know I didn't eat breakfast this morning I was really hungry so I
[15:28.120 --> 15:33.240]  pulled into a diner lamada line real fast on my way to work because they can
[15:33.240 --> 15:37.320]  just boom give you an omelette in about two minutes I scarfed it down and I
[15:37.320 --> 15:41.400]  sat there looking at the people in the restaurant and it wasn't that they were
[15:41.400 --> 15:46.280]  physically soft I mean I'm not some you know arrogant you know super you know
[15:46.280 --> 15:51.080]  sports guy who's you know 2% body fat it just I looked at their eyes and the
[15:51.080 --> 15:54.720]  self-satisfied way they were eating and the little ticks of the way they were
[15:54.720 --> 15:58.760]  slurping their coffee and the way they were caressing their iPads and the way
[15:58.760 --> 16:01.920]  they were and I watched the people behind the counter fighting with each other
[16:01.920 --> 16:07.480]  and you know having slights and just unhappy I mean they're in the lap of
[16:07.480 --> 16:12.000]  luxury the poorest Americans got it better than 90 plus percent of people
[16:12.000 --> 16:16.040]  in the world did you know that our ancestors no matter what color you are
[16:16.040 --> 16:21.480]  had to crawl and scratch through the mud and had to fight hyenas and tigers and
[16:21.480 --> 16:26.520]  lions and grizzly bears and cave bears and wolves and polar bears and were
[16:26.520 --> 16:31.680]  bitten and chased by giant giant hordes clouds of mosquitoes and had to watch
[16:31.680 --> 16:38.440]  most of their children die northern European people yeah literally every
[16:38.440 --> 16:43.280]  grave they dig up have fractures and cracks in their bones from from literally
[16:43.280 --> 16:47.040]  jumping on the backs of animals that they were you know killing with their bare
[16:47.040 --> 16:55.520]  hands same story in Africa they just dug up gladiators from 1900 years ago in
[16:55.520 --> 16:59.280]  England Roman gladiators you know that's the Romans controlled Albion
[16:59.280 --> 17:06.240]  Britannia today the UK and these guys have bites all over their bodies from
[17:06.240 --> 17:11.400]  lions and tigers and wolves and bears some of which have been exported to
[17:11.400 --> 17:18.360]  England and and and huge wounds all over them and of course in those type of
[17:18.360 --> 17:21.560]  gladiatorial events they were actually local heroes and were well-paid more
[17:21.560 --> 17:26.560]  slaves by that period but the point is and and and you can look at the
[17:26.560 --> 17:32.240]  National Geographic photos you know of these giant skeletons imagine 1900 years
[17:32.240 --> 17:35.520]  ago when the average man was five foot three the average height of these
[17:35.520 --> 17:40.720]  skeletons is six four six five some are almost seven feet I mean that's who we
[17:40.720 --> 17:46.960]  are okay is vicious powerful intelligent hard-working dynamic people not
[17:46.960 --> 17:52.280]  what we've become not what we've become and I'm gonna tell you you look at the
[17:52.280 --> 17:55.640]  elite you look at Queen Beatrix and the photos London Guardian as ever at
[17:55.640 --> 17:59.960]  Bilderberg you look at these other elitist they're a much a crazed-eyed
[17:59.960 --> 18:05.760]  demonic control freaks who are soft and pathetic as well now I told you I give
[18:05.760 --> 18:10.040]  you the big secret of the BP oil spill we've got a full breakdown coming up in
[18:10.040 --> 18:14.240]  the next hour and a half at prisonplanet.com and info wars.com I've worked
[18:14.240 --> 18:17.680]  on it Steve Watson's the main organizer of the article so as Paul Watson has
[18:17.680 --> 18:22.640]  contributed it's gonna boil down every facet and it's gonna be six seven pages
[18:22.640 --> 18:27.760]  long so if you're lazy I'm talking to new listeners you won't be able to
[18:27.760 --> 18:33.760]  understand the full scope of why we say evidence mounts that Gulf oil spill is
[18:33.760 --> 18:38.960]  false flag I believe that's gonna be the headline okay if you want to be free
[18:38.960 --> 18:42.760]  you're gonna have to at least read a seven page article I'm not being condescending
[18:42.760 --> 18:46.920]  here I people call in all the time and send me letters asking me basic
[18:46.920 --> 18:51.840]  questions that I've answered thousands of times are asking me to write them a
[18:51.840 --> 18:55.800]  letter back telling them everything look I can't tell you how to eat soup I
[18:55.800 --> 18:58.400]  can't tell you how to change your diapers folks and I'm not trying to be
[18:58.400 --> 19:04.400]  mean here I like good questions too it's just that the we're so childlike they
[19:04.400 --> 19:08.120]  tell us there isn't a world government when it's openly been set up and is
[19:08.120 --> 19:14.160]  unelected and criminal the games are over ladies and gentlemen the world's
[19:14.160 --> 19:18.480]  always been a barbarous dangerous place now it's just got a high-tech overlay a
[19:18.480 --> 19:22.880]  soft touchy-feely overlay which makes it even more deadly it's a creeping death
[19:22.880 --> 19:28.680]  but I'll tell you what this oil spill is over all about it's a political global
[19:28.680 --> 19:35.240]  distraction from the stock market collapses worldwide and the debt bubble
[19:35.240 --> 19:39.360]  that's out of control it serves a lot of purposes and when the globalist do a
[19:39.360 --> 19:43.680]  cost-benefit analysis and decide that a that a false flag will help them on
[19:43.680 --> 19:47.760]  multi fronts they launch it I'm gonna go over the different ways this helps the
[19:47.760 --> 19:51.320]  new older agenda then I'm gonna get into the economy and it is hardcore news
[19:51.320 --> 19:54.840]  basically it's everything we've talked about on the show for a decade is now

[24:04.880 --> 24:17.160]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network we are back live
[24:17.160 --> 24:22.120]  well after Copenhagen their big push to get a funding mechanism for world
[24:22.120 --> 24:25.680]  government was in deep trouble as the Bilderberg group was quoted as saying
[24:25.680 --> 24:30.600]  last week we're about whipped public knows we're running a giant fraud a
[24:30.600 --> 24:36.800]  giant scam and so you have a big oil leak out in the gulf a month after
[24:36.800 --> 24:44.120]  Obama announced that he was gonna allow drilling oh quite a reversal then he
[24:44.120 --> 24:49.840]  gives an award to the very oil rig that explodes mysteriously and then all these
[24:49.840 --> 24:54.520]  top petroleum geologist and others tell them how to fix it and they never
[24:54.520 --> 25:01.920]  follow any of the advice and so now they're gonna get to try to push their
[25:01.920 --> 25:07.080]  global carbon tax in the name of having money to clean this up and they're also
[25:07.080 --> 25:10.480]  hyping the oil like it's the end of the world yeah it'll mess up the season in
[25:10.480 --> 25:15.920]  Florida and some areas yeah but oil is biodegradable I mean I've been to the
[25:15.920 --> 25:20.080]  beach I've seen balls of oil that have little crustaceans little crabs and
[25:20.080 --> 25:27.640]  plants growing out of it actually full of nutrients within a year a different
[25:27.640 --> 25:33.080]  biologist are on record saying almost all the oil will be consumed it'll be
[25:33.080 --> 25:40.240]  it's it's biodegradable what is toxic they've got the cleanup crews with all
[25:40.240 --> 25:46.000]  these poisonous heavily refined chemicals dumping it into the oil on the
[25:46.000 --> 25:50.640]  seashores to dissolve it that's what's killing most the animals you know they
[25:50.640 --> 25:56.480]  show you an oily pelican it's the government banning all fishing out
[25:56.480 --> 26:02.880]  there when most areas don't have oil they could do some spot testing and
[26:02.880 --> 26:06.400]  checking of the seafood some of it might be contaminated they could demand that
[26:06.400 --> 26:12.240]  there be spot checks but but but what's causing the economic destruction is that
[26:12.240 --> 26:19.400]  the government for a month has said no fishing and the Gulf of Mexico and the
[26:19.400 --> 26:23.440]  areas that are affected and they're blocking the media we've seen even CBS
[26:23.440 --> 26:27.760]  News with all their power and armed men in boats pull up and say we're under
[26:27.760 --> 26:36.080]  orders from Halliburton local police and Coast Guard since when do they take the
[26:36.080 --> 26:42.840]  orders now I know I haven't talked a lot about the spill in the last 40 plus
[26:42.840 --> 26:47.600]  days and that's because I've been collating I've been tracking I've been
[26:47.600 --> 26:52.240]  researching I've been constantly thinking about it day one my gut told me it's
[26:52.240 --> 26:58.440]  probably an inside job but I didn't say that on air I hoped it wasn't an inside
[26:58.440 --> 27:02.440]  job it's definitely an inside job and that into the fact that they're letting
[27:02.440 --> 27:07.280]  it leak and not fixing it and blocking locals from protecting themselves to
[27:07.280 --> 27:12.880]  expand federal control to expand federal international precedent to expand
[27:12.880 --> 27:18.360]  corporate governance precedent where BP is in control the whole operation and
[27:18.360 --> 27:23.280]  overall it's a political distraction from what's happening in the economy I'm
[27:23.280 --> 27:26.200]  going to cover this more when we start the next hour as we got a guest coming up
[27:26.200 --> 27:30.840]  on GMO foods and new studies showing that it's causing massive reductions in
[27:30.840 --> 27:38.200]  fertility and deformities and total sterility within three generations but
[27:38.200 --> 27:42.040]  look at these headlines this is what they're trying to distract from tax hikes
[27:42.040 --> 27:49.160]  and the 2011 economic collapse the Wall Street Journal that's the Wall Street
[27:49.160 --> 27:56.080]  Journal tax hikes and the 2011 economic collapse and government knows when they
[27:56.080 --> 27:59.440]  raise taxes less money comes into the Treasury because it shuts down the
[27:59.440 --> 28:05.800]  economy Kennedy cut taxes by 50% in one tax bracket Dr. Roberts pointed out it
[28:05.800 --> 28:12.480]  was only 35% in one bracket oh I'm sorry only 35% cut for one group but 50% for
[28:12.480 --> 28:20.840]  poorer people less wealthy and tax receipts doubled of course California
[28:20.840 --> 28:24.400]  raised a bunch of taxes in their economy completely went into cardiac arrest of
[28:24.400 --> 28:28.200]  course New York passed more taxes and they went into cardiac arrest of course
[28:28.200 --> 28:31.840]  Florida packs pass more taxes and they went into cardiac arrest of course
[28:31.840 --> 28:35.760]  Michigan passed more taxes they went to cardiac arrest they keep calling Rick
[28:35.760 --> 28:39.840]  Perry the big conservative I'm paying three new taxes as a business owner as
[28:39.840 --> 28:44.960]  they call me here in Texas I supposedly tax friendly state and yeah people are
[28:44.960 --> 28:49.040]  fleeing here because we're not raising taxes as fast that's what the global
[28:49.040 --> 28:56.120]  government's about nowhere to run so tax hikes and the 2011 economic collapse
[28:56.120 --> 29:00.800]  they want it to collapse we have their own documents just like the timber wolf
[29:00.800 --> 29:05.180]  documents from Goldman Sachs today's corporate profits reflected income
[29:05.180 --> 29:10.160]  shift in 2010 these profits will tumble next year proceeded most likely by the
[29:10.160 --> 29:13.800]  stock market and they admit the big bankers and the big money are making
[29:13.800 --> 29:18.200]  record profits everybody else is going to hell in a hand basket doctors lawyers
[29:18.200 --> 29:24.760]  school teachers cops firemen auto mechanics farmers ranchers retail

[34:34.000 --> 34:38.040]  conservative he's very careful he understates it and the understatement is
[34:38.040 --> 34:43.960]  absolutely devastating there is no doubt that they know that these GMO foods are
[34:43.960 --> 34:50.120]  causing low birth weight sterilization reduced fertility toxic problems seeds of

[36:13.280 --> 36:18.080]  ready to hear the truth. Jeffrey Smith is the founder of the Institute for
[36:18.080 --> 36:21.000]  Responsible Technology whose mission is to promote the responsible use of
[36:21.000 --> 36:23.920]  technology and stop genetically engineered foods and crops through
[36:23.920 --> 36:28.080]  grassroots and national strategies he's an acclaimed international speaker
[36:28.080 --> 36:32.320]  trusted authority on GMOs best-selling author admired filmmaker seeds of
[36:32.320 --> 36:39.200]  deception.com seeds of deception.com is the website and I wanted to get him on
[36:39.200 --> 36:45.040]  because I've literally seen hundreds of studies out of Canada England China Japan
[36:45.040 --> 36:51.400]  the United States I've interviewed you know former GMO company heads who found
[36:51.400 --> 36:55.720]  that it was you know really hurting the guinea pigs and mice and rats I've talked
[36:55.720 --> 37:00.240]  to other GMO heads who would say look this stuff sterilizing the the rats
[37:00.240 --> 37:03.880]  reducing fertility they'd say whether that's not a problem is it with there's
[37:03.880 --> 37:07.600]  too many people so the point is whether you think there's too many people or not
[37:07.600 --> 37:12.160]  we shouldn't have forced medication going on and then the bigger issue is
[37:12.160 --> 37:16.960]  this is irrevocably altering the DNA of the human species so in the next 22
[37:16.960 --> 37:21.920]  minutes I wanted to get Jeffrey Smith's take on all of this he would be with us
[37:21.920 --> 37:26.160]  longer but he's on the road making a film right now but here's a headline
[37:26.160 --> 37:29.920]  research links genetically modified food to long-term sterility a new study
[37:29.920 --> 37:33.120]  done by Russian scientists suggested genetically modified food may cause
[37:33.120 --> 37:36.720]  like jumping in front of a bus going under miles an hour might hurt you a
[37:36.720 --> 37:40.160]  new study done by Russian scientists suggested genetically modified food may
[37:40.160 --> 37:43.600]  cause long-term sterility that is sterility in the second and third
[37:43.600 --> 37:48.200]  generations the scientists use hamsters for the research and divided them into
[37:48.200 --> 37:52.360]  groups one group of hamsters was fed normal diet without any soy products a
[37:52.360 --> 37:56.400]  second group was fed non GMO genetically modified organism soy the third
[37:56.400 --> 38:00.760]  eight GMO soy and the fourth group was fed an even higher amount of GMO soy
[38:00.760 --> 38:05.520]  than the third each group produced about seven of eight liters of baby hamsters
[38:05.520 --> 38:09.960]  each without any problems but when the research selected new breeding pairs
[38:09.960 --> 38:13.880]  from the offspring the second generation had a slower growth rate and a bunch of
[38:13.880 --> 38:16.520]  other studies show that that our guests look over in a moment and research their
[38:16.520 --> 38:21.480]  sexual maturity later than normal they also had a more mortality rate five
[38:21.480 --> 38:26.280]  times higher oh you like live until 25 instead of a hundred that's what we're
[38:26.280 --> 38:33.160]  talking about that's a hundred you know five times lower 25 they also had a
[38:33.160 --> 38:38.000]  mortality rate five times higher than the hamsters did who ate the soy even
[38:38.000 --> 38:42.400]  more shocking was the fact that nearly all of the third generation GMO soy
[38:42.400 --> 38:46.600]  hamsters were sterile and also experienced hair growth inside their
[38:46.600 --> 38:51.000]  mouths there's photos of that and it goes on now now here perfect soft kill
[38:51.000 --> 38:55.320]  weapon mercury in the vaccines has been shown within one generation to reduce
[38:55.320 --> 39:00.920]  fertility and damage DNA folks this is real and we already have massive sperm
[39:00.920 --> 39:05.240]  count lowered levels we have massive infertility and women you know about it
[39:05.240 --> 39:08.520]  you see in the news alright I'm gonna shut up for the next two segments and go
[39:08.520 --> 39:14.200]  to Jeffrey Smith offer of genetic roulette which is so important to get
[39:14.200 --> 39:18.960]  folks Jeffrey break down this new study by the Russians and then let's go into
[39:18.960 --> 39:22.920]  some of the other studies we've seen yes they actually the scientist I spoke
[39:22.920 --> 39:28.760]  with said it was just a routine study they just simply fed hamsters
[39:28.760 --> 39:33.960]  genetically modified soy in those four groups you said non GM soy GM soy high
[39:33.960 --> 39:39.560]  GM soy and no soy and there was no problem in the groups that were eating
[39:39.560 --> 39:45.240]  the normal natural soy as part of their diet or no soy at all but those that
[39:45.240 --> 39:49.800]  ate the genetically engineered soy they didn't actually show the problems in
[39:49.800 --> 39:53.880]  the first generation the second generation was slower growth slower onset
[39:53.880 --> 39:58.200]  for maturity but by the third generation that's when the the boom was the boom
[39:58.200 --> 40:03.200]  head and that was when nearly all of the adults had lost the ability to have
[40:03.200 --> 40:08.440]  baby and the in the infant mortality rate the infant mortality rate the rate
[40:08.440 --> 40:14.200]  in which they died at the birth or soon after that was five times higher in one
[40:14.200 --> 40:20.800]  of the GM soy group and four times higher in the other compared to the control so
[40:20.800 --> 40:27.440]  you had both a level of infertility slower growth and also a higher death
[40:27.440 --> 40:34.040]  rate among the baby now these this man Alexi Surov had done some research on
[40:34.040 --> 40:39.800]  hamsters before and found quite a rare situation where hair and mucus would
[40:39.800 --> 40:44.360]  form inside the mouth of the hamsters that the pictures are so disgusting that
[40:44.360 --> 40:47.480]  when I posted my article in Huffington Post I didn't put the picture there I
[40:47.480 --> 40:50.520]  just linked to it in case people wanted to see it because I didn't want to force
[40:50.520 --> 40:56.480]  them but it's just that you know inside the inside ring inside the teeth big
[40:56.480 --> 41:00.640]  gaping holes with hair and mucus growing in there and he and this was
[41:00.640 --> 41:06.560]  published in a study by Surov some months before but what he found out was
[41:06.560 --> 41:10.400]  that the group that was eating the genetically modified soy had a much
[41:10.400 --> 41:16.040]  higher incidence of this rare disorder than he had ever seen in his study
[41:16.040 --> 41:22.120]  suggesting that there may be some very significant disorders resulting from the
[41:22.120 --> 41:28.160]  genetically engineered soy now I asked him at this point he released his
[41:28.160 --> 41:32.960]  information as part of a report on April 15th and I asked him when it would be
[41:32.960 --> 41:38.160]  published and that would be in the summer and he was cautious he said we don't
[41:38.160 --> 41:41.640]  know if it's the genetically engineered component we don't know if it's the
[41:41.640 --> 41:46.960]  extra roundup herbicide on the soy let me explain what that means to those who
[41:46.960 --> 41:52.080]  are not familiar with GMO the primary reason why people genetically modify
[41:52.080 --> 41:58.600]  crops is so they can drink a poisonous herbicide and not die and roundup is the
[41:58.600 --> 42:04.040]  most popular so you have roundup ready soy beans corn cotton canola and sugar
[42:04.040 --> 42:08.920]  beat that you can spray with a toxic roundup herbicide and it will kill all
[42:08.920 --> 42:13.520]  of the other plant biodiversity but not the roundup ready crop now I am learning
[42:13.520 --> 42:21.280]  just this month that the roundup itself has components in it that might promote
[42:21.280 --> 42:25.240]  sterility and what happens is and this is I'm saying might because I'm still
[42:25.240 --> 42:28.560]  investigating and even once I fully investigated I probably would be cautious
[42:28.560 --> 42:34.040]  on the and of course this is Monsanto of Agent Orange fame yes exactly what
[42:34.040 --> 42:37.680]  Santa was the one that produces roundup they produced they're one of the
[42:37.680 --> 42:42.720]  producers of Agent Orange and of course PCBs and they're in charge by the way
[42:42.720 --> 42:47.640]  to determine if their GM foods are safe not the FDA the FDA policy claims that
[42:47.640 --> 42:51.160]  it's up to Monsanto and the other biotic companies to determine if their foods
[42:51.160 --> 42:54.200]  are safe they don't have to tell the FDA before it goes on the market and I saw
[42:54.200 --> 42:58.800]  just last month Obama appointed the head regulator at the Food and Drug
[42:58.800 --> 43:03.000]  Administration is the former Monsanto executive yes exactly Michael Taylor
[43:03.000 --> 43:08.720]  he's the US food safety czar in charge of the US food supply he was the one that
[43:08.720 --> 43:13.480]  was in charge of policy at the FDA when the FDA said no testing was necessary
[43:13.480 --> 43:17.520]  and it was based on a policy that claimed that the FDA wasn't aware of
[43:17.520 --> 43:20.960]  information showing that GMOs were different but documents made public
[43:20.960 --> 43:24.680]  from a lawsuit shows of course that that was a lie because the overwhelming
[43:24.680 --> 43:28.280]  consensus among the FDA's own scientists whether GMOs were not only
[43:28.280 --> 43:31.880]  different but inherently dangerous and to create things like allergens toxins
[43:31.880 --> 43:35.440]  new diseases and nutritional problems but the person in charge of that policy
[43:35.440 --> 43:39.400]  Michael Taylor Monsanto's former attorney and later Monsanto's vice president I
[43:39.400 --> 43:43.600]  believe because he put that policy through is responsible probably for more
[43:43.600 --> 43:46.840]  food related illnesses and deaths than anyone in human history and he is in
[43:46.840 --> 43:51.880]  charge of the food safety in the United States amazing now now again this isn't
[43:51.880 --> 43:55.480]  just one prestigious Russian study though I mean and you have it all in
[43:55.480 --> 44:01.080]  your book a meticulously documented but I've seen countless studies not just in
[44:01.080 --> 44:07.000]  rats or mice or hamsters or rabbits that they tend to test on but that they've
[44:07.000 --> 44:11.680]  done studies showing humans with lower birth rate and a higher mortality and
[44:11.680 --> 44:17.800]  that it's it's not just this type of soybean whether it's the poison or the
[44:17.800 --> 44:24.240]  soybean itself but separately in other GMO crops that are GMO not for a
[44:24.240 --> 44:29.960]  pesticide related reason but for say a flavor reason or for a longevity reason
[44:29.960 --> 44:36.160]  I mean this is really beginning to become crystal clear in focus well let's
[44:36.160 --> 44:39.360]  talk first about the animal studies and then let's take a look for correlation
[44:39.360 --> 44:43.280]  in human studies we do know for example that there are indigenous people in
[44:43.280 --> 44:48.680]  Argentina who've been sprayed by roundup by plane and their complaining of
[44:48.680 --> 44:53.720]  birth defects and possibly there might be in sterility there in sterility
[44:53.720 --> 44:57.680]  there to infertility but I'm not sure but I think we can look with more
[44:57.680 --> 45:02.280]  confidence at the animal feeding studies in fact the most important one I think
[45:02.280 --> 45:06.640]  that follows the hamster one was done five years earlier also by someone with
[45:06.640 --> 45:12.320]  the Russian Academy of Sciences and it was Irina Irmakova a senior researcher
[45:12.320 --> 45:16.600]  at the Academy and she just completely innocently fed genetically modified
[45:16.600 --> 45:20.880]  soy flour was from Archer Daniels Midland variety bought in the store the
[45:20.880 --> 45:25.880]  same kind that we eat here and she fed it to female rats starting two weeks
[45:25.880 --> 45:30.240]  before they got pregnant and continued feeding them through pregnancy and
[45:30.240 --> 45:33.960]  lactation and then started feeding the offspring as part of their diet what
[45:33.960 --> 45:41.000]  was interesting was that when the babies were born many of the babies were
[45:41.000 --> 45:46.320]  smaller quite a bit smaller when they were from the GM fed mothers but most
[45:46.320 --> 45:51.680]  importantly more than half of them died within three weeks the control group
[45:51.680 --> 45:57.600]  that ate the GM the non-GM soy only one in ten died so was a five-fold increase
[45:57.600 --> 46:02.200]  in infant mortality with the hamster study we just discussed there was a
[46:02.200 --> 46:06.440]  difference of five-fold and that was 25 percent versus five percent or in
[46:06.440 --> 46:10.040]  another group five twenty percent versus five percent so it was four or five
[46:10.040 --> 46:15.960]  times higher with the hamsters and it was five times higher with the rats now
[46:15.960 --> 46:20.560]  what was interesting with the Irmakova study is she of course was you know
[46:20.560 --> 46:24.400]  attacked and vilified by the boutique industry she published her research as
[46:24.400 --> 46:30.400]  preliminary asking for more money to do follow-up research but never got it in
[46:30.400 --> 46:34.120]  fact she told me as we after we spoke at the European Parliament together that
[46:34.120 --> 46:38.920]  her boss had been told by his boss that you know under pressure that she couldn't
[46:38.920 --> 46:43.400]  do any more GM research so one of her colleagues actually tried to comfort her
[46:43.400 --> 46:47.320]  by saying well maybe the GM soy will solve the overpopulation problem on earth
[46:47.320 --> 46:50.920]  and she wasn't comforted but what happened was when they were when she was
[46:50.920 --> 46:58.000]  attacked by the boutique industry one of the one of the valid issues was that she
[46:58.000 --> 47:02.120]  never did a biochemical analysis of the feed to see if there might be a toxin in
[47:02.120 --> 47:06.720]  the bag of flour but after she had completed her research three times with
[47:06.720 --> 47:11.520]  similar results coincidentally the Russian Academy of Sciences facility
[47:11.520 --> 47:15.680]  where she was working started feeding all of the rats a rat chow based on
[47:15.680 --> 47:20.120]  genetically modified soy and she had a brilliant idea of simply asking her
[47:20.120 --> 47:24.680]  colleagues after two months what was the infant mortality rate in their study
[47:24.680 --> 47:28.240]  they weren't studying GMO they just happen to be feeding all the infant all
[47:28.240 --> 47:33.200]  the all of the rats GM soy it turns out it had skyrocketed to over 55 percent
[47:33.200 --> 47:38.520]  this suggests it's not some obscure toxin that had made its way into her
[47:38.520 --> 47:43.760]  particular batch but it was more likely a generic problem in addition when you go
[47:43.760 --> 47:48.000]  back further Italian researchers said genetically modified soy to mice and
[47:48.000 --> 47:52.480]  they found that the testicles were damaged the structure and function of
[47:52.480 --> 47:56.800]  the testicles were changed including the young sperm cell and when they looked
[47:56.800 --> 48:01.280]  at the offspring in the embryo stage at very very young embryo stage they
[48:01.280 --> 48:06.120]  removed it from the from the wounds of the pregnant mice who had been eating
[48:06.120 --> 48:10.280]  genetically modified soy or natural soy and they found that those that have been
[48:10.280 --> 48:16.560]  eating genetically modified soy the embryo DNA function differently so her
[48:16.560 --> 48:22.800]  McCovish was in Italy or McCovish in in back in Moscow she decided to feed GM
[48:22.800 --> 48:27.560]  soy also to male rats and she showed me the picture which I use in my
[48:27.560 --> 48:33.080]  presentation and the testicles changed from pink to blue so normally the
[48:33.080 --> 48:38.480]  testicles are pink in in rat and male rats and and she showed the controls and
[48:38.480 --> 48:42.240]  they were pink but they were blue and those that were fed genetically modified
[48:42.240 --> 48:47.680]  soy incredible absolutely incredible and and now what is it eight major food
[48:47.680 --> 48:51.200]  crops are being genetically engineered and now they want to go to hundreds
[48:51.200 --> 48:55.760]  that's right exactly the goal of Monsanto the explicit goal is to
[48:55.760 --> 48:59.560]  genetically engineer 100% of all the commercial seeds in the world and patent
[48:59.560 --> 49:03.120]  them and they have a plan to achieve it now it doesn't stop with so we also have
[49:03.120 --> 49:08.680]  evidence of infertility with corn and we also have it with the GM cotton with
[49:08.680 --> 49:14.320]  the corn the Austrian government that genetically modified corn that was both
[49:14.320 --> 49:20.400]  roundup ready and also produced its own toxic pesticide called BT it was both
[49:20.400 --> 49:25.620]  both events in the same gene in the same DNA so they found that the
[49:25.620 --> 49:30.520]  more of this corn that they fed to mice the fewer the babies they had and the
[49:30.520 --> 49:34.880]  smaller the babies were and by the way large portions of the corn and things
[49:34.880 --> 49:39.880]  we now eat in the United States are of these GMO varieties about 85% of the
[49:39.880 --> 49:44.240]  corn now so folks you're having your family lined annihilated right now
[49:44.240 --> 49:48.560]  you're being just you're under assault and the end you know if you walked up
[49:48.560 --> 49:52.440]  and punched a cop in the face you go to prison but they feed this to the cops
[49:52.440 --> 49:55.120]  and the cops just love it I mean I'm just pointing out that we're all being
[49:55.120 --> 50:00.080]  assaulted so we've seen this also in livestock I happen to discover a new
[50:00.080 --> 50:06.120]  source that changed his animals to non GM feed and found that the litters got
[50:06.120 --> 50:09.880]  bigger I do know of about two dozen farmers that claim that certain
[50:09.880 --> 50:14.960]  varieties of GM corn cause their pigs or cows to become sterile some pigs had
[50:14.960 --> 50:20.120]  false pregnancies or gave birth to bags of water and also in India they
[50:20.120 --> 50:25.640]  discovered that buffalo they were feeding on genetically modified cotton
[50:25.640 --> 50:29.680]  cakes either the cotton seed cake and now these are cognizant genetically
[50:29.680 --> 50:34.960]  engineered to produce a bone toxic pesticide most of the buffalo that ate
[50:34.960 --> 50:39.040]  the cotton seed cake got reproductive problems including prolapse
[50:39.040 --> 50:44.160]  uteruses, sterility and abortions and premature delivery.
[50:44.160 --> 50:49.000]  Jeffrey Smith stay there how do they think they're gonna get away with this
[50:49.000 --> 50:55.160]  folks well they think you're dumb they want population reduction and they're
[50:55.160 --> 51:01.720]  getting no grandchildren for you folks we'll be right back we all know that the

[52:17.640 --> 52:21.920]  it means all the world under their control the United Nations would take

[52:30.680 --> 52:35.000]  centuries to establish an oppressive world government I believe first of all
[52:35.000 --> 52:38.520]  that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global
[52:38.520 --> 52:42.560]  financial system global governance with the establishment of the G20 so it's
[52:42.560 --> 52:46.880]  gonna be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else and I got news for you

[53:05.320 --> 53:11.200]  martial law under executive order 11,004 will they do it will they pull the
[53:11.200 --> 53:16.680]  trigger this time we all pray they stand down but an engineered crisis seems
[53:16.680 --> 53:22.560]  more likely with each passing day think it can't happen here executive order
[53:22.560 --> 53:29.800]  10,990 locks down all highways executive order 10,995 ceases control of all media

[53:36.120 --> 53:41.760]  executive orders are now cocked loaded and waiting for the right crisis so if
[53:41.760 --> 53:45.320]  you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America or have

[54:08.280 --> 54:20.120]  Dillon yeah if things don't change soon ladies and gentlemen I have literally
[54:20.120 --> 54:25.760]  read hundreds of studies from prestigious organizations like the
[54:25.760 --> 54:30.880]  International Journal of Biological Sciences extremely prestigious here's
[54:30.880 --> 54:36.360]  the headline Monsanto GMO corn linked to organ failure study reveals in lab
[54:36.360 --> 54:41.280]  animals and they test on rabbits and guinea pigs and rats and mice because
[54:41.280 --> 54:46.760]  their metabolic system is very similar to us same thing with pigs or monkeys
[54:46.760 --> 54:53.520]  primates I mean this isn't a joke okay this isn't a joke this isn't a game and
[54:53.520 --> 54:57.800]  most the food we eat now when you go to a Mexican food restaurant and eat corn
[54:57.800 --> 55:05.360]  chips it's frying you now we can say no we can take control of our society we
[55:05.360 --> 55:09.880]  can demand real organic food we can demand the feds don't change the
[55:09.880 --> 55:14.520]  organic descriptions story can be non-organic this is life and death and
[55:14.520 --> 55:19.400]  I know this stuff and it's hard for me to not forget what I'm doing but I've got
[55:19.400 --> 55:23.480]  to take care of my children I've got to make sure they can have a healthy life
[55:23.480 --> 55:28.920]  and have grandchildren this this is eugenics make no mistake genetic roulette
[55:28.920 --> 55:33.040]  the documented health risk of genetically engineered foods Jeffrey M. Smith
[55:33.040 --> 55:36.520]  available at info wars.com and his international best-seller seeds of
[55:36.520 --> 55:40.200]  deception you need to get these and get them out to everybody you know he's
[55:40.200 --> 55:44.480]  gonna be with us for one more segment continuing sir I mean you go on for
[55:44.480 --> 55:49.200]  hours what about the study I was talking to you about that genetic engineer out
[55:49.200 --> 55:52.280]  of England who's just had a stroke unfortunately but I've interviewed him
[55:52.280 --> 55:57.400]  years ago you know who found similar things in his studies talk about that
[55:57.400 --> 56:03.160]  well this is Dr. Arpad Pustai a very interesting case he is the world's leading
[56:03.160 --> 56:08.440]  researcher in his field and was granted a three million dollars by the UK
[56:08.440 --> 56:13.400]  government to create a way to test for the safety of GMOs which was supposed
[56:13.400 --> 56:19.480]  to be implemented into the EU law but what happened was he accidentally
[56:19.480 --> 56:24.640]  discovered that GM foods are very dangerous that his rats after 10 days
[56:24.640 --> 56:28.440]  had smaller brains livers and testicles partial actually delivered damaged
[56:28.440 --> 56:31.680]  immune systems and potentially pre-cancerous cell growth in the
[56:31.680 --> 56:36.360]  digestive tract he went public with his concerns and was a hero for about two
[56:36.360 --> 56:43.000]  days at his institute and then the pro GM UK Prime Minister's office apparently
[56:43.000 --> 56:48.760]  placed two phone calls to the director of the Institute on a Tuesday afternoon
[56:48.760 --> 56:53.400]  on a Wednesday morning Dr. Pustai's contract was cancelled his data was
[56:53.400 --> 56:58.200]  withdrawn his team was dismantled they never implemented the protocols in fact
[56:58.200 --> 57:03.000]  they told him if he spoke at all about his research he would be sued they went
[57:03.000 --> 57:07.800]  through a whole process to try and trash his reputation to promote the biotechnology
[57:07.800 --> 57:13.000]  industry and what he had discovered was very interesting you see he fed rats a
[57:13.000 --> 57:17.600]  potato that was genetically engineered with a gene that produces an insecticide
[57:17.600 --> 57:23.040]  but he had tested the insecticide over and over again on rats and knew it was
[57:23.040 --> 57:28.960]  safe in fact in his study he fed some rats the natural potato with spiked with
[57:28.960 --> 57:33.120]  the insecticide and others eating the genetically engineered potato that
[57:33.120 --> 57:37.440]  produced the insecticide from within each cell but only those that ate the GM
[57:37.440 --> 57:40.880]  potato that genetically modified potato got these illnesses and got this
[57:40.880 --> 57:45.080]  so it's the way the poison was being delivered exactly it was the process of
[57:45.080 --> 57:49.240]  creating it was the process of genetically engineering the potato that
[57:49.240 --> 57:52.840]  caused the problem and that was what a great concern for him was because he was
[57:52.840 --> 57:57.600]  aware that the same process was used to create the soy and corn and and tomatoes
[57:57.600 --> 58:01.440]  and it was eating their livers folks you know you don't drink Jack Daniels
[58:01.440 --> 58:04.560]  because you don't want to die of liver failure hell you eat potatoes and corn
[58:04.560 --> 58:09.560]  you get it I mean this is this is serious now in addition to his work
[58:09.560 --> 58:16.200]  we're finding that the roundup persists for a long time on the field after its
[58:16.200 --> 58:20.040]  parade of course Monsanto tried to say was biodegradable but two courts of law
[58:20.040 --> 58:24.240]  one here and one in France all demanded and ordered them to remove it from the
[58:24.240 --> 58:27.760]  label well what about tap water we know it gets on the water table Jeffrey stay
[58:27.760 --> 58:30.240]  there we're gonna have five minutes left with you on the other side because
[58:30.240 --> 58:33.520]  you're on the road with your film your film's coming out in October I can't
[58:33.520 --> 58:38.280]  wait to see it he's an amazing author and filmmaker Jeffrey M. Smith I'm Alex

[58:49.160 --> 58:54.280]  the question is where should the American people draw their line in the
[58:54.280 --> 58:59.760]  sand what have we got a republic or a mocking a republic is based on a
[58:59.760 --> 59:04.240]  constitution which protects minority rights not democracy not mob rule two
[59:04.240 --> 59:07.280]  wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner so they think they own our land
[59:07.280 --> 59:12.400]  they think they're on our water children our education our money we have to
[59:12.400 --> 59:17.280]  define who we are and what we will tolerate somebody's gonna ask you what
[59:17.280 --> 59:22.840]  you did during the Patriot uprising we have the facts we have the Constitution
[59:22.840 --> 59:26.560]  we have the Bill of Rights we have common law knowledge is power ladies and
[59:26.560 --> 59:30.480]  gentlemen and I'm so excited to be able to offer you don't tread on me rise the
[59:30.480 --> 59:34.360]  Republic tyranny is upon us but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the
[59:34.360 --> 59:38.920]  American people is rising a new tool in the info war don't tread on me order it

[01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:19.600]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:26.400]  Alex Jones all right coming up we're gonna open the phones on a host of issues
[01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:31.040]  and blitz through financial news military news it's all coming up but
[01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:37.840]  finishing up with our guest author of Seeds of Deception Jeffrey M Smith both
[01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:42.640]  books available at info wars.com just hundreds and hundreds of these studies
[01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:47.000]  of the sterilization the reduction infertility I saw headlines the London
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:51.520]  Guardian this week and last week Jeffrey where it was reported that the so-called
[01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:56.960]  government watchdogs now in England the ones investigating GMO it turns out are
[01:00:56.960 --> 01:01:02.080]  on the GMO payroll just like the flu vaccine crowd and are basically lying so
[01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:07.840]  they are beginning to get caught with their hands in the genetic engineering
[01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:12.800]  bioethicist eugenics jar oh yeah in fact some of the independent people on a
[01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:17.520]  on a panel actually resigned because it was another one of those takeovers I've
[01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:20.800]  actually traveled to 32 countries thinking about GMOs and they see all
[01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:23.840]  over the world it's Monsanto's own people that are
[01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:27.440]  installed into the positions to approve Monsanto's own products just like in the
[01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:32.840]  U.S. but I want to say it's not all depressing news you see in Europe when
[01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:38.000]  Dr. Proustine was finally able to speak seven months after he was he discovered
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:44.760]  he was shut down it all hell broke loose in the media 750 articles were written
[01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:48.840]  in a single month within 10 weeks the tipping point of consumer rejection was
[01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:52.520]  achieved and it within a single week virtually every major food company
[01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:56.240]  committed to stop using genetically modified ingredients in their European
[01:01:56.240 --> 01:02:00.160]  brand but that was because the Europeans were then informed by the mainstream
[01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:04.080]  media in the U.S. it was described as one of the 10 most under-reported events
[01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:08.800]  of the year by project sensors just like Fox wasn't allowed to report on the
[01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:12.920]  genetically you know engineered growth hormone exactly they were they were
[01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:16.480]  silenced with two threats from Monsanto's attorney promising quote dire
[01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:21.560]  consequences unquote to Fox TV and Rupert Murdoch so what happened is in
[01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:25.160]  the United States the same companies that removed GM ingredients from Europe and
[01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:29.480]  from Japan still sell it to us here all we need is about five percent of U.S.
[01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:33.440]  shoppers to start avoiding brands that contain GM ingredients it'll turn these
[01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:37.880]  things into a pure marketing liability with zero consumer benefits and we will
[01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:41.760]  see a tipping point now the good news is it's already happening the fastest
[01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:47.720]  growing claim among store brands in 2009 was GMO free supermarket news a big
[01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:51.760]  journal that predicts supermarket trends and food trends predicted that this
[01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:55.240]  year would show an unprecedented upsurge of consumer awareness and concern
[01:02:55.240 --> 01:03:00.720]  about GMOs October happens to be non-gmo month 10 10 10 is non-gmo day and
[01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:05.080]  are the sales of our non-gmo shopping guide and the views on our site at
[01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:09.720]  non-gmo shopping guide dot com which help people maneuver around the GM
[01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:13.600]  ingredients to buy the non-gm brands they're skyrocketing so what's
[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:16.600]  happening right now and I've been traveling all over the United States for
[01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:21.160]  seven years I travel about a hundred and sixty five days a year I'm seeing an
[01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:28.000]  unprecedented upsurge of activism but not just energy but intelligence a lot of
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:32.080]  people who realize the details now they're quoting back to me things that I
[01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:36.080]  said years ago they're expanding on it they're reading about it and so right
[01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:40.640]  now we have the perfect opportunity to create a tipping point and so on our
[01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:47.080]  website at at the at responsible technology org which is our nonprofit
[01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:51.880]  Institute for Responsible Technology we have a campaign for healthier eating in
[01:03:51.880 --> 01:03:57.560]  America we have a link to our shopping guide we have free videos online free
[01:03:57.560 --> 01:04:02.120]  podcast a free newsletter that you can sign up for to get it once that's another
[01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:05.600]  great point they're talking about health care cost off the charts meanwhile on
[01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:11.240]  record the GMO food we're eating is frying our livers frying our kidneys
[01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:15.000]  I mean we've got the studies right here just devastating people you know I'm
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:19.200]  talking to some patients this week who when they got off of GMOs their symptoms
[01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:25.280]  disappeared very very quickly I mean it is remarkable and and the old I just you
[01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:28.040]  asked me earlier about the human studies and unfortunately there's only one
[01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:31.880]  published human eating study and they found that the genes inserted into
[01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:36.040]  the soybean can transfer into the DNA of the bacteria living inside our
[01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:40.520]  intestines and continue to function long after we stopped eating the GMO so
[01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:44.360]  it's not good news but the UK government just stopped any follow-ups so we
[01:04:44.360 --> 01:04:48.080]  don't know really how dangerous or prevalent it is all right well Jeffrey
[01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:51.960]  Smith we really appreciate you coming on with us we look forward to speaking to
[01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:55.920]  you again in the future God bless you my friend just thank you this is live and

[01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:03.880]  thank you hi folks this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the silver
[01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:08.160]  lungs generator now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and
[01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:12.440]  deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution
[01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:16.280]  through the lungs the respiratory system is the first line of defense for
[01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:20.640]  airborne pathogens and viruses the silver lungs generator infuses the
[01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:24.800]  respiratory system with your self-produced nano silver solutions and
[01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:30.120]  also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream with
[01:07:30.120 --> 01:07:34.480]  continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products you can now
[01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:39.680]  produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the silver lungs generator very
[01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:44.160]  easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided making production fast and

[01:07:50.280 --> 01:08:01.080]  technology of the silver lungs generator that's www.silverlungs.com
[01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:10.200]  ease the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network if you
[01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:18.560]  just joined us I had Jeffrey M. Smith on and when I read his book seeds of
[01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:21.560]  deception I just recently re-read it read it two years ago when it first came
[01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:25.320]  out international number one best-seller or genetic roulette the
[01:08:25.320 --> 01:08:30.880]  documented health risk of genetically engineered foods it's what what what's
[01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:39.200]  so angering that's a word what what in rages mean is that when I'm reading it
[01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:43.520]  I've already read all these studies separately over the years so I know how
[01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:47.520]  real it is and he has big indexes and links to the studies and mainstream
[01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:53.520]  media reports they know that it's sterilizing people and he was talking
[01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:57.000]  about one genetic engineer you know doing the studies and they said this is
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:02.000]  sterilizing all these mammals and they said yes there's too many people I mean
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:06.440]  that's what this is all about folks that it's on record that's what Bill Gates
[01:09:06.440 --> 01:09:11.360]  was at Bilderberg about and by the way this doesn't just fry your testicles
[01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:17.040]  or your ovaries or your uterus it within months of feeding it to rats and
[01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:28.440]  getting pigs the liver begins to fail you're eating this right now I've looked
[01:09:28.440 --> 01:09:31.160]  at the studies people are eating the same amount of sugar they 20 years ago
[01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:40.560]  why is there are almost 3,000% increase in diabetes people were drinking more
[01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:44.920]  liquor smoking more cigarettes eating more white flour 50 years ago than they
[01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:50.480]  are now and I saw a report that lung cancer in women is up six-fold what it
[01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:57.200]  was a decade ago six-fold and they're not even smoking like they were
[01:09:57.200 --> 01:10:03.160]  ladies and gentlemen you are being savaged by the globalist this is real
[01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:11.600]  how am I supposed to just set up here and calmly talk about this stuff that's
[01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:18.040]  why I'm not happy when I have personal success in fact it's almost frustrating
[01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:22.080]  I want to have success against these people I want to be able to go the
[01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:25.080]  grocery store and buy stuff for my children without having to read all
[01:10:25.080 --> 01:10:29.120]  the labels that that that won't destroy their fertility and attack their
[01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:34.400]  entire blood system their nervous system and their organs and their
[01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:41.840]  endocrine system their hormones they are tailoring the genetic engineering
[01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:45.200]  yesterday I was doing research for the film I'm working on and I saw a Reuters
[01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:49.800]  article as well as a scientist article and several others about genetic
[01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:57.160]  watermarking remember the 1984 movie Blade Runner when he he's the detective
[01:10:57.160 --> 01:11:03.360]  and he brings a scale he finds in a bathtub at the house where the genetic
[01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:08.040]  engineered drones are living or had been living and he brings it down to China
[01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:12.000]  town where they've got the local genetic engineer shops and he brings it he says
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:20.440]  is this a fish scale and she goes snake scale highest quality ching cho made
[01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:25.520]  this he make yo snake and she zooms in with electron microscope and there is
[01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:35.040]  the barcode numbers on the the the at the cellular level they can now put bar
[01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:42.760]  codes on the DNA strands and of course they made that movie 25 years ago 26
[01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:52.160]  years ago based on a Philip K. Dick book a true genius PKD I'm truly honored to
[01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:58.280]  be in a movie of scanner darkly a remake of a PKD book but or a film
[01:11:58.280 --> 01:12:04.720]  adaptation I should say on a remake his first one and it turns out I Jacobson
[01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:07.400]  Rob Jacobson doing research pointed this out to me so last night I did some more
[01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:12.280]  search and found out they were barcoding DNA 30 years ago see folks they
[01:12:12.280 --> 01:12:16.360]  just now tell you they're barcoding DNA they were doing it 30 years ago you know
[01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:20.640]  they just now a month ago launched a secret black ops space plane telling you
[01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:24.720]  it's their first one when they've had the things in service since the 60s at
[01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:31.320]  least I mean we're not in Kansas anymore boys and girls they got barcodes 25
[01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:42.320]  years ago on fish scales that wasn't science fiction folks there's clear
[01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:45.960]  evidence the Nazis and I have the government reports did produce primitive
[01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:51.200]  a bombs but what didn't know how to properly deploy them with verner von
[01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:58.280]  Braun and their v1 v6's and others and yes ladies and gentlemen they were we
[01:12:58.280 --> 01:13:03.880]  know the Nazis were cloning rabbits we don't have proof they were cloning
[01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:08.240]  humans but they can clone humans now Argentina is one of the places they've
[01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:12.640]  been caught doing it and Costa Rica they call it genetic engineering
[01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:17.800]  terrorism you're not in Kansas anymore there's a reason the elite don't care
[01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:23.080]  about you and are arrogant they've got bio weapons that will kill people from a
[01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:29.120]  certain clan and a certain tribe right down to the village they've got genetic
[01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:34.880]  engineer bio weapons that will kill individuals that will kill mixed
[01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:43.840]  individuals we're not in Kansas anymore we're not in Kansas anymore now I'm
[01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:47.240]  gonna tell the FBI listening I'm gonna tell the NSA listening I'm gonna tell
[01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:51.640]  the CIA listening you are compartmentalized and you know it did you
[01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:59.600]  get a memo not to eat the four new varieties of Monsanto corn in every
[01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:04.040]  major study herding the honeybees and hurting all the mammals that eat it
[01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:09.320]  attacking the organs the studies are out there did you get a memo that sodium
[01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:14.360]  fluoride attacks every endocrine producing gland and your testicles and
[01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:19.640]  your uterus and your ovaries and your brain on record they've known it for 80
[01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:24.480]  plus years I've got University of Texas studies from the 30s about how it's a
[01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:29.000]  toxic sedative and should they put it in the water the town where I live they
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:40.400]  knew in 1933 and 34 did you get a memo what you like your you like your gun
[01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:44.880]  belt you like your gun holster hanging on the wall and it impresses the girls
[01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:48.280]  when you have them over and you like the adrenaline rush are kicking people's
[01:14:48.280 --> 01:14:52.040]  doors in and you know they're a drug dealing degenerates and there's 20
[01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:55.960]  grand in cash that you take 10 and you think you're real tough and you think
[01:14:55.960 --> 01:14:59.760]  you got it all figured out and you've been trained to hate the public hey hey
[01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:04.920]  pal you're being hit with chemical and biological weapons every day in your
[01:15:04.920 --> 01:15:10.920]  food in your water and in your air you are already with us you understand that
[01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:15.080]  you're already with Alex Jones if you're dumb enough to sit there and
[01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:18.360]  believe that you're not with us and that somehow you're part of the power
[01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:26.680]  elite or that Alex Jones he's a wacky dude now there's a reason that the
[01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:32.200]  Washington Post today called me the extremely influential talk show host
[01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:38.680]  and said that the Republican Party doesn't like to admit how influential I
[01:15:38.680 --> 01:15:47.000]  am but the spin is I'm influential and I'm a right winger what does right wing
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:51.800]  have to do with wanting hundreds of chemical poisons out of the water
[01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:57.240]  supply that I've got to avoid like the black plague and I got to go through a
[01:15:57.240 --> 01:16:01.440]  lot of trouble to avoid not just not drinking it but bathing in it showering
[01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:10.560]  and it's spraying on my lawn everywhere what does that mean no no no what I
[01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:19.280]  cover transcends the term right wing by a trillion percentage points not 110% by
[01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:25.720]  a trillion points what does any of this matter you think I care when I walk in a
[01:16:25.720 --> 01:16:30.200]  grocery store if I've got a little bit of a pot belly and that people are looking
[01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:35.280]  at me you think I even care when really good-looking beautiful women come on to
[01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:39.280]  me in the street no I don't even care not that I see their beauty I like them
[01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:42.880]  I'm attracted to them but I've got a wife and children I owe allegiance to them
[01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:48.320]  and I'm not even worried about rolling around in the hay with some woman at a
[01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:53.520]  hotel room folks I'm worried and angry at myself that I can't articulate to you
[01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:57.760]  how hardcore serious you think I'm on an ego trip that Michael Savage plugged me
[01:16:57.760 --> 01:17:01.600]  yesterday you think I'm on an ego trip that drudge is linked to four of our
[01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:06.800]  stories the last week you think I'm in an ego trip that I can that George
[01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:11.640]  Humphrey's been in India and Japan and South America and people come up and say
[01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:17.720]  I saw you and fall the Republic no I'm not an ego trip I flip out I freak out I
[01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:21.920]  think every night my god I've got tens of millions of people listening to what I
[01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:27.240]  have to say on the aggregate I better do a good job I've got a real shot at
[01:17:27.240 --> 01:17:34.400]  mobilizing the population to defeat these people you think this is a game
[01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:39.760]  ladies and gentlemen all of you little ego maniacs that are jealous of me that
[01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:43.920]  poses patriots that attack me and lie about me and produce new lies every day
[01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:49.040]  you think I care what you say about me I don't care of the new world order kills
[01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:54.640]  me by by not caring I don't want to die I want to continue my work but that's it
[01:17:54.640 --> 01:17:58.600]  that's the only reason I don't want to die I love life I love it with an
[01:17:58.600 --> 01:18:05.040]  incredible passion but this information is so important what man as a warrior
[01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:09.400]  with a warrior instinct to defend humanity that's what a man's all about
[01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:13.600]  would not what would would not throw themselves against us with everything
[01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:15.960]  they've got
[01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:24.000]  folks you better get your priorities straight okay you are being chemically
[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:30.760]  and biologically murdered slowly within another generation because we're
[01:18:30.760 --> 01:18:34.640]  already one generation into this so within another two generations most of
[01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:40.760]  us are going to be retarded deformed and infertile you're like well I'm having
[01:18:40.760 --> 01:18:46.280]  fun I don't care your whole humanity is the species in your fellow humans and
[01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:50.520]  building a better civilization you know the globalists have turned you into
[01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:55.720]  these monsters they've turned you into these soft pathetic worms and then and
[01:18:55.720 --> 01:18:58.200]  then they say it's a self-fulfilling prophecy well look their worms they
[01:18:58.200 --> 01:19:01.840]  deserve to die well let me tell you those worms I saw at Bilderberg the photos
[01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:07.320]  I've seen of them those are the real worms the jealous petulant wicked people
[01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:12.600]  on power trips so divorced from the species in humanity that they get off
[01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:17.920]  they get off on all the stillbirths and all the infertility the US has the
[01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:21.440]  highest level of infant mortality I mean that's an official number of the last
[01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:25.360]  decade it's the GMO food it's the poison I mean I don't think that's funny
[01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:30.280]  mothers crying and their after birth with dead babies okay I don't want any
[01:19:30.280 --> 01:19:34.280]  part of that I don't want any part of people little kids died a little liver
[01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:38.400]  failure all around me and people died at 25 all around me a cancer I don't want
[01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:41.680]  any part of what you're doing I don't want any part of your new world order I
[01:19:41.680 --> 01:19:46.840]  am not part of you you understand that I am divorced from your mind control I am
[01:19:46.840 --> 01:19:51.600]  I am separated from all of your evil and all of your worldly crap do you
[01:19:51.600 --> 01:19:57.880]  understand that I am not part of you Babylon I am 110% outside of your evil
[01:19:57.880 --> 01:20:01.920]  do you understand that do you read me when you hear the words water
[01:20:01.920 --> 01:20:06.400]  purification what comes to mind if it's Berkey water purification systems this
[01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:10.760]  message is for you did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains
[01:20:10.760 --> 01:20:15.040]  fluoride at less than two cents per gallon Berkey water filters purify
[01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:18.920]  treated and untreated water remove dangerous chlorine fluoride and
[01:20:18.920 --> 01:20:22.720]  contaminants from municipal water these filters are powerful enough to purify
[01:20:22.720 --> 01:20:26.920]  stagnant pond water making them perfect for rainwater collection systems from
[01:20:26.920 --> 01:20:31.040]  the smallest to the largest systems big Berkey water filters calm as what you

[01:25:12.760 --> 01:25:16.640]  listen to him a decade ago telling you the CIA was shipping in the cocaine and
[01:25:16.640 --> 01:25:20.960]  heroin yeah because in 1996 I watched CIA hearings in Congress where they
[01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:25.600]  admitted it all they admit it it's always been hidden in plain view the
[01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:28.840]  inspector general kind of like they go on Fox news and go well the Marines don't
[01:25:28.840 --> 01:25:32.920]  like it but here's the commanding colonel they do help grow the opium explain
[01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:36.560]  why well if we don't help kind of we'll get the opium and make money that makes

[01:25:44.920 --> 01:25:48.080]  in prison if they're dumb enough to get caught using heroin because we got to
[01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:52.360]  keep it illegal to keep the price up so all these big bankers can live in 50
[01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:56.480]  million dollar houses and laugh at you and the bankers all think they own the
[01:25:56.480 --> 01:25:59.120]  planet remember Bilderberg last week in the London Guardian London Guardian
[01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:04.600]  reporter heard Bilderberg heads of security talking about yours truly and
[01:26:04.600 --> 01:26:07.880]  how we bullhorned them and saying oh it's so terrible that we have this
[01:26:07.880 --> 01:26:11.000]  welfare state that they even have money to come here people people were
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:16.200]  confused by that they said over and over again they said you know in the
[01:26:16.200 --> 01:26:19.560]  comments of the London Guardian and on YouTube about it they were saying well
[01:26:19.560 --> 01:26:25.040]  why why are they saying Alex is on welfare you know we're not on welfare
[01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:29.320]  well what does that mean no no no no no no no no no no no no no no it's their
[01:26:29.320 --> 01:26:33.880]  economy in their eyes it's their world it's their water it's their food it's
[01:26:33.880 --> 01:26:39.520]  their money because you're dumb enough to go along with it you're too lazy in
[01:26:39.520 --> 01:26:43.840]  their eyes to stop eating the GMO corn to stop eating the GMO maize to stop
[01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:47.440]  eating the GMO soybeans you're not gonna stop you're not gonna stop drinking
[01:26:47.440 --> 01:26:50.560]  the fluoride water you're not gonna go down to the city council according to
[01:26:50.560 --> 01:26:54.240]  them because they're just gonna sit there and smile at you in a patronizing
[01:26:54.240 --> 01:26:59.040]  way while this mayor drinks a diet coke frying their brain and everybody's just
[01:26:59.040 --> 01:27:04.200]  gonna go hell head over heels right into Hades and they see it as their world
[01:27:04.200 --> 01:27:08.120]  they see it that if you're even able to have a job and be able to you know that's
[01:27:08.120 --> 01:27:12.600]  what Bill Joy talked about in the in the April issue of 2000 wired magazine
[01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:17.280]  Bill Joy co-owner of Sun Microsystems holding three engineering degrees in
[01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:23.440]  with 175 IQ what what do you say he said recently I went to an elitist high-tech
[01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:28.080]  conference with 200 of the leaders and owners of the technology system worldwide
[01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:34.000]  and all they talked about was do we kill everyone I mean here he is he's a
[01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:38.560]  somewhat of a moral person and he says I went to this meeting and the only
[01:27:38.560 --> 01:27:44.560]  discussion was do we kill everyone now I happen to see on Charlie Rose a few
[01:27:44.560 --> 01:27:48.640]  years before that the co-owner of it and he was not a friendly fellow and he was
[01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:52.840]  saying they said what do you look forward most to in the new millennium
[01:27:52.840 --> 01:27:56.640]  coming up in a few years this is like a 98 he says I look forward to everyone
[01:27:56.640 --> 01:28:00.960]  having an implantable chip he had an American accent but it was an Atlantic
[01:28:00.960 --> 01:28:04.360]  accent it was almost British I look forward to the time when everyone has a
[01:28:04.360 --> 01:28:09.080]  chip and my son has a chip and I track everywhere he goes and we're all safe I
[01:28:09.080 --> 01:28:17.240]  look forward to a world government and Charlie Rose is like oh yes oh it's their
[01:28:17.240 --> 01:28:22.240]  world and you ain't in it what did George Carlin say it's a big club and you ain't
[01:28:22.240 --> 01:28:28.440]  in it because America's owners they own you and they're dumbing you down and
[01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:31.600]  that's why nobody's ever gonna get smart with public education because it's
[01:28:31.600 --> 01:28:36.480]  designed to turn you into a moron that only cares about the latest sneakers
[01:28:36.480 --> 01:28:40.480]  and the and then and how to strut around and act cool while you're being
[01:28:40.480 --> 01:28:46.680]  murdered with chemical and biological weapons I mean does it matter having a
[01:28:46.680 --> 01:28:51.680]  big jet boat with red flames on it driving around acting cool I mean what
[01:28:51.680 --> 01:28:56.680]  does mating even matter when you don't even have a future what does any of this
[01:28:56.680 --> 01:29:04.160]  mean everything's about mating big houses money powered looks it's all
[01:29:04.160 --> 01:29:12.800]  about at a low level at a primitive 16 year old level once you get a chief
[01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:16.160]  mindset a true guardian mindset you understand it's about protecting the
[01:29:16.160 --> 01:29:20.880]  species moving the species forward and uplifting humanity the globalists don't
[01:29:20.880 --> 01:29:23.760]  believe you can be uplifted they want to kill you dead in the hammer well I've
[01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:27.840]  looked at these elitists let me tell you they're not uplifted okay Henry Kissinger

[01:29:36.600 --> 01:29:40.640]  control freaks and you know what I'm here raising the alarm for my species
[01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:44.880]  humanity to rise up against these people and defeat them now are they gonna be

[01:35:09.240 --> 01:35:16.760]  right now seriously I want to talk to everybody 1-800-259-9231 and when I
[01:35:16.760 --> 01:35:21.080]  start the next hour I'm gonna blitz through a ton of news on the economy the
[01:35:21.080 --> 01:35:28.320]  oil spill Iran sanctions I just I've got huge stacks of news here and I'm going
[01:35:28.320 --> 01:35:33.520]  to cover it oh yes but right now let's go ahead and again give that number out
[01:35:33.520 --> 01:35:38.400]  to everybody I'm looking at my I am here John are you getting that I am
[01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:44.080]  information I'm sending in good you know I'm down here in Austin Texas and I've
[01:35:44.080 --> 01:35:46.880]  got a whole crew here my own phone system and everything but the satellite
[01:35:46.880 --> 01:35:50.440]  up links are in Minnesota and I could run the show on my own and syndicated on
[01:35:50.440 --> 01:35:54.320]  my own but I just love John Harmon who's been with me for about five six years so
[01:35:54.320 --> 01:35:59.880]  much that he runs things up there from Houston of course he's not actually in
[01:35:59.880 --> 01:36:05.880]  South Texas at Houston it's an analogy a parallel to the NASA program I'm up
[01:36:05.880 --> 01:36:11.680]  here floating around in outer space and then John's there at the spiritual
[01:36:11.680 --> 01:36:16.000]  Houston of the Genesis Network in Minneapolis Minnesota John did you say
[01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.880]  on air you love me too
[01:36:18.880 --> 01:36:30.640]  oh good old John Harmon John Harmon all right ladies and gentlemen yeah again
[01:36:30.640 --> 01:36:38.160]  it's very hard to every day read a new major study where you start feeding GMO
[01:36:38.160 --> 01:36:45.880]  crops to rats to monkeys to apes to guinea pigs and it just absolutely
[01:36:45.880 --> 01:36:49.120]  slaughters them I mean they just their organs shut start shutting down everywhere
[01:36:49.120 --> 01:36:55.240]  there their infertility the infertility takes over and the adults are screwed up
[01:36:55.240 --> 01:37:00.880]  their their offspring are just absolutely irrevocably fried and then
[01:37:00.880 --> 01:37:06.680]  their offspring are just unrecognizable monsters oh thank you new world order
[01:37:06.680 --> 01:37:11.760]  that's really friendly of you what a nice group of people again eugenics is
[01:37:11.760 --> 01:37:15.440]  everything I don't want to talk about the oil spill I mean yeah it's bad it's
[01:37:15.440 --> 01:37:18.560]  screwing up things for people in the Gulf but if the government wasn't using
[01:37:18.560 --> 01:37:22.360]  more toxic chemicals to disperse the oil that are hundreds of times more toxic
[01:37:22.360 --> 01:37:25.640]  than the oil it's biodegradable this wouldn't be happening they to set the
[01:37:25.640 --> 01:37:30.000]  oil well on fire day one it just be dissipating but you can't have carbon
[01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:35.560]  to oxide it's so deadly what do you think forest fires of volcanoes put off now
[01:37:35.560 --> 01:37:39.960]  they want to nuke it in fact before we go to calls me play this nuke clip this is
[01:37:39.960 --> 01:37:48.080]  a clip from Fox News and about a week ago they started talking about using
[01:37:48.080 --> 01:37:55.800]  using nukes yes let's detonate a nuke on the ocean floor that will radiate the
[01:37:55.800 --> 01:38:01.160]  food we're going to be eating see when you detonate a nuke down low below the
[01:38:01.160 --> 01:38:04.880]  ground or at ground level it then combines with metals and other isotopes
[01:38:04.880 --> 01:38:13.600]  and creates extremely radioactive you know variance you know look into the
[01:38:13.600 --> 01:38:17.800]  science yourself if you'd like but that's why a dirty bomb nuke they would
[01:38:17.800 --> 01:38:23.280]  jacket it say with cobalt and then it makes it a dirty bomb where the
[01:38:23.280 --> 01:38:28.880]  radiation is many many times more deadly than say a clean so-called clean
[01:38:28.880 --> 01:38:34.040]  airburst at say 2,000 feet of a 50 megaton hydrogen weapon coming in from
[01:38:34.040 --> 01:38:41.720]  orbit after it's dislodged from its Merv coupler so they want to detonate a
[01:38:41.720 --> 01:38:45.520]  nuke down there which could open up a giant oil fissure and and make it even
[01:38:45.520 --> 01:38:53.440]  worse and they use some Russian film example from the 60s where they destroyed
[01:38:53.440 --> 01:38:58.240]  a gas well that had been burning for a year this isn't some gas well pluming
[01:38:58.240 --> 01:39:02.360]  and burning burning at the surface which is not a problem putting off
[01:39:02.360 --> 01:39:06.680]  carbon dioxide that plants breathe greedily snapping it all up a part of
[01:39:06.680 --> 01:39:13.240]  the life cycle on this planet this is oil and gas going into the Gulf of
[01:39:13.240 --> 01:39:21.440]  Mexico so here's that Fox News clip is this the solution of the BP oily
[01:39:24.440 --> 01:39:31.240]  that's right nuke it some scientists do advocate this the Soviets apparently
[01:39:31.240 --> 01:39:36.120]  succeeded in doing it here is the video they say actually shows it and now
[01:39:36.120 --> 01:39:41.880]  summit Forbes agree nuke it hi everybody I'm David Aspen welcome to Forbes on Fox
[01:39:41.880 --> 01:39:46.240]  here today we have mr. Steve Forbes who as you can see had to wrestle Quentin
[01:39:46.240 --> 01:39:51.240]  Hardy for that seat in San Francisco rich Carl guard Lizzie McDonald Neil
[01:39:51.240 --> 01:39:57.560]  Weinberg and Stefan Fitch so rich I gotta say I'm a skeptic here but nuke it
[01:39:57.560 --> 01:40:02.400]  well David this is a kind of option you really have to put on the table why the
[01:40:02.400 --> 01:40:07.400]  leak has been going for almost seven weeks 500,000 gallons of oil a day tar
[01:40:07.400 --> 01:40:11.520]  balls are showing up on the coast of Florida the only surefire option to
[01:40:11.520 --> 01:40:16.960]  stop this is a relief well which is 10 weeks away that's August hurricane
[01:40:16.960 --> 01:40:21.600]  that's enough of these idiots I mean give me a break and what is this new
[01:40:21.600 --> 01:40:25.920]  vanity fair thing Fox has got where we're like celebrities sponsor their own
[01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:34.160]  shows boy I met Steve Forbes at a Republican function function in Dallas
[01:40:34.160 --> 01:40:38.480]  one so that was that they're taking photographs for in college and I mean
[01:40:38.480 --> 01:40:43.880]  tell you what a what a fruit box I mean what a fruit cake this is who rules us
[01:40:43.880 --> 01:40:50.160]  as these type of mad scientist nerds and the mad scientist nerds that are
[01:40:50.160 --> 01:40:53.760]  jacking with your food and messing with the atmosphere geoengineering they want
[01:40:53.760 --> 01:40:59.000]  to set a nuke off in the Gulf of Mexico yeah that's a really good idea look at
[01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:03.440]  how the Pacific Islanders did it bikini most of them died within five years of
[01:41:03.440 --> 01:41:08.160]  having that hydrogen bomb detonated 10 miles from him yeah let's let's don't
[01:41:08.160 --> 01:41:12.320]  do it and say we did okay and they're running around oh look some tar balls
[01:41:12.320 --> 01:41:17.560]  it's the end of the world you're hyping it and look at our balls and it's bad
[01:41:17.560 --> 01:41:21.800]  for the fisheries and it's bad but there's microbes in the ocean that are
[01:41:21.800 --> 01:41:26.000]  going to eat that oil naturally occurring there's natural oil plumes
[01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:29.320]  when they have earthquakes sometimes that have started up what do you think
[01:41:29.320 --> 01:41:34.720]  the LeBrayer tar pits are in Los Angeles it's natural it's not a good
[01:41:34.720 --> 01:41:38.840]  thing I'll tell you again I've read on the news the acid chemicals they're
[01:41:38.840 --> 01:41:45.200]  using to disperse the oil are horrible compared to the oil itself so I look I'm
[01:41:45.200 --> 01:41:52.760]  done ranting I said I'd take your calls it's just they're trying to normalize
[01:41:52.760 --> 01:41:56.840]  the use of nukes you know they call them oh we've got many nukes now that are no
[01:41:56.840 --> 01:42:01.120]  big deal that we're gonna use against Iran you know they just destroy a four
[01:42:01.120 --> 01:42:06.480]  or five square mile area and penetrate down about 400 feet to destroy some of
[01:42:06.480 --> 01:42:10.760]  the deepest bunkers well yeah but anyone who's researched nuclear weapons even a
[01:42:10.760 --> 01:42:16.120]  cursory research knows that nuclear weapons that hit the ground throw up a
[01:42:16.120 --> 01:42:21.280]  bunch of radioactive dust and clouds and combine to create deadly isotopes with
[01:42:21.280 --> 01:42:28.640]  all the surrounding metal so you nuke a nuke base full of uranium and plutonium
[01:42:28.640 --> 01:42:34.480]  just when they use DU that is nothing compared you know to souped up plutonium
[01:42:34.480 --> 01:42:41.040]  and uranium radiation detectors all over the world pick it up and you like
[01:42:41.040 --> 01:42:44.680]  breathing it the globalists have a death wish ladies and gentlemen they're a
[01:42:44.680 --> 01:42:49.960]  bunch of psychopathic lunatics ah but I hear the good old boys you know to be an
[01:42:49.960 --> 01:42:54.520]  American man you hand over everything to the bankers you bend over to the IRS you
[01:42:54.520 --> 01:42:59.840]  sell out your property rights but you talk about nuke and nuke and a revs and
[01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:05.320]  say in parking lot I hear parking lot again I think I'm in my head's gonna
[01:43:05.320 --> 01:43:15.280]  explode hey all just nigga oh it's not fair to do southern accents I am a
[01:43:15.280 --> 01:43:18.920]  southern slash Texan kind of the gateway to the west some people say to
[01:43:18.920 --> 01:43:22.800]  Texans really aren't southerners I think we're both but proud of my southern
[01:43:22.800 --> 01:43:25.960]  heritage but I do have to hear that from time to time but I have heard you know
[01:43:25.960 --> 01:43:31.360]  the old Yankees I tell you what we need to do rush we need to just know the
[01:43:31.360 --> 01:43:37.600]  entire region that's the way we handles it okay there now we've been fair let's
[01:43:37.600 --> 01:43:43.400]  go ahead and talk to John in Texas John you're on the air go ahead hi Alex
[01:43:43.400 --> 01:43:48.040]  hey buddy hey you know during World War two we had a lot of oil tankers were
[01:43:48.040 --> 01:43:52.800]  sunk off the coast and all that oil washed back up on the shore and we
[01:43:52.800 --> 01:43:58.800]  pretty much rebounded from that didn't we oh they've had oil leaks in Saudi
[01:43:58.800 --> 01:44:02.680]  Arabia in the Gulf the last time I checked it's grown since that are ten
[01:44:02.680 --> 01:44:08.960]  times or more bigger than this they had one three years ago in the Gulf off
[01:44:08.960 --> 01:44:13.240]  Mexico that was as big as this and you never heard about it I know this is just
[01:44:13.240 --> 01:44:17.120]  a bunch of hype and then the terror attack is the government shutting down
[01:44:17.120 --> 01:44:22.280]  the fishing now in the entire Gulf that is the terror attack that is the event
[01:44:22.280 --> 01:44:27.160]  I wonder though if we have a big hurricane in a Gulf if it picks up all
[01:44:27.160 --> 01:44:30.880]  that contaminated water and especially with all that the dispersant in there
[01:44:30.880 --> 01:44:34.840]  it takes it in dumps it into our lakes and freshwater of marshes and stuff I
[01:44:34.840 --> 01:44:38.320]  wonder what the effect that's going to be well the the hydrologist and the
[01:44:38.320 --> 01:44:43.240]  meteorologist in the last two weeks have got detailed satellite map overlays of
[01:44:43.240 --> 01:44:47.400]  the currents that are very well mapped by the buoys and they know exactly where
[01:44:47.400 --> 01:44:52.520]  that oil's going most of it is you're not gonna hit land thank God it was far
[01:44:52.520 --> 01:44:59.120]  enough out until it hits Europe sorry folks and then and then the Arctic but
[01:44:59.120 --> 01:45:05.600]  it's gonna go out around Florida out then up the eastern seaboard but most of
[01:45:05.600 --> 01:45:11.320]  it doesn't get about a hundred miles offshore so because it is farther out
[01:45:11.320 --> 01:45:15.920]  in those major currents which they have mapped I mean you know these things are
[01:45:15.920 --> 01:45:20.680]  as you know very predictable that most of this is gonna be dispersed into the
[01:45:20.680 --> 01:45:25.560]  larger Atlantic but yeah but still going during the hurricane season that's
[01:45:25.560 --> 01:45:28.720]  gonna be a different different ball of wax because if you're ever been out
[01:45:28.720 --> 01:45:34.440]  there fishing or on a cruise and I have been in the early summer the the Gulf
[01:45:34.440 --> 01:45:39.760]  and Caribbean are sometimes like glass it's like Valhalla with the with the you
[01:45:39.760 --> 01:45:44.200]  can even see whales out there sperm whales other types of whales that go
[01:45:44.200 --> 01:45:48.680]  into the Gulf and into the Caribbean you can see the flying fish everywhere but
[01:45:48.680 --> 01:45:53.680]  as soon as those hurricanes get going in August it turns into first cruise I
[01:45:53.680 --> 01:45:57.200]  took I'm only taking like four of them was for Katrina people noticed that I
[01:45:57.200 --> 01:46:02.400]  wasn't there the four days before Katrina I took a feel three hour tour three
[01:46:02.400 --> 01:46:06.000]  hour tour but it was a four-day no five-day cruise on a carnival you know
[01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:12.000]  cheap cruise and I and I went and I had my two little kids with me and then the
[01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.840]  hurricane had just formed they're like oh don't worry it's over here in the
[01:46:14.840 --> 01:46:18.440]  eastern Caribbean they were about to go into Mexico and dock they were so scared
[01:46:18.440 --> 01:46:22.520]  they decided to race it so they raced it and it was six hours behind me on that
[01:46:22.520 --> 01:46:26.480]  Sunday as we docked in Galveston and they had all the decks closed and it was
[01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:30.880]  30-foot waves and waves were breaking windows and there was alarms going off
[01:46:30.880 --> 01:46:35.120]  and people were vomiting everywhere never told that story there but yes if that
[01:46:35.120 --> 01:46:39.640]  kind of stuff is going on then yes I've been in the cruise ship in Katrina it
[01:46:39.640 --> 01:46:43.920]  was it was it was actually an adventure but anything else sir yeah I live in
[01:46:43.920 --> 01:46:47.200]  Houston I moved to Houston in 1981 from my Michigan and I've been through a
[01:46:47.200 --> 01:46:51.280]  number of hurricanes in a proper storm Allison that flooded that turned all the
[01:46:51.280 --> 01:46:55.880]  Houston into a lake and so and I know that the gut when the hurricanes form
[01:46:55.880 --> 01:46:58.720]  out there they pick up all that water and they bring it in so I was wondering
[01:46:58.720 --> 01:47:02.440]  absolutely right now it's going to be dispersed in the Atlantic and I'll be a
[01:47:02.440 --> 01:47:07.000]  tar ball here a little bit of oil there a part of it did plume out into Louisiana
[01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:11.920]  but then turn back again most of it poor Louisiana keeps getting the brunt but
[01:47:11.920 --> 01:47:14.520]  no when the hurricanes head it's going to be hell I appreciate your call John
[01:47:14.520 --> 01:47:21.320]  good points Jonathan in Kansas you're on the air hey Alex it's probably a good
[01:47:21.320 --> 01:47:26.600]  idea to get pen and paper because I have six good articles for you and somebody
[01:47:26.600 --> 01:47:30.920]  keeps stealing my pens probably a guy named Alex Jones but will somebody
[01:47:30.920 --> 01:47:37.000]  bring me a pen place yeah go ahead right this three articles on social
[01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:41.720]  engineering I have for you and three articles on eugenics all right you have
[01:47:41.720 --> 01:47:48.120]  a pen yet yeah you can also email them to show tips but go ahead okay one is
[01:47:48.120 --> 01:47:55.320]  MSNBC today's college kids lack empathy compared to 30 years ago it's all about
[01:47:55.320 --> 01:48:01.560]  me now study fine that's one another one oh my gosh I mean I mean I literally you
[01:48:01.560 --> 01:48:05.320]  can tell body language once you're tuned in and intelligent and you know have
[01:48:05.320 --> 01:48:09.880]  discernment and literally the average person now sits there at a restaurant in
[01:48:09.880 --> 01:48:15.080]  a personal mindless delusional power trip and they all look hatefully at
[01:48:15.080 --> 01:48:19.000]  everybody else and yeah I don't and these will be the stormtrooper enforcers
[01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:24.280]  this was done scientifically so the headline is college students lack
[01:48:24.280 --> 01:48:30.920]  empathy yeah today's college kids lack empathy I want it go ahead okay the
[01:48:30.920 --> 01:48:37.320]  second one is examiner calm serial killers and politicians share traits I
[01:48:37.320 --> 01:48:44.800]  knew that well another one what's that from again examiner calm serial killers
[01:48:44.800 --> 01:48:49.440]  and politicians share traits well yeah people wonder why cops are getting
[01:48:49.440 --> 01:48:53.200]  subreddling crazy they're third they're pulled from the general public large
[01:48:53.200 --> 01:48:56.800]  portions of the public well I mean I mean I'm here's a microcosm example you
[01:48:56.800 --> 01:49:01.360]  can finish up you every day or two we hear about some woman beaten with a lead
[01:49:01.360 --> 01:49:06.520]  pipe on this on the side of a major road or or you know the case of a few months
[01:49:06.520 --> 01:49:10.640]  ago of a guy in northern California on the side of the highway hundreds of
[01:49:10.640 --> 01:49:14.760]  cars passed as he beat a toddler to death over an hour and the cops had to
[01:49:14.760 --> 01:49:18.600]  show up in a helicopter and land then they shot the guy thank God he deserved
[01:49:18.600 --> 01:49:23.440]  it because the police ran up as he was bashing with child's brains and a kid

[01:54:02.200 --> 01:54:08.640]  of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[01:54:09.600 --> 01:54:14.800]  yeah people are getting lazier and lazier mainly because they never worked
[01:54:14.800 --> 01:54:18.600]  on a farm never worked in a machine shop ever found out how much fun it is to
[01:54:18.600 --> 01:54:23.600]  actually do work they just sit and watch television they're not humans they
[01:54:23.600 --> 01:54:28.760]  they've lost their humanity and they just respond to stimuli and so they're
[01:54:28.760 --> 01:54:32.280]  getting more and more beast shield they just want money they want sex they want
[01:54:32.280 --> 01:54:38.440]  to feed their petty instincts and then they're totally unfulfilled folks the
[01:54:38.440 --> 01:54:45.800]  big secret is you're not fulfilled I'm here to tell you in high school and a
[01:54:45.800 --> 01:54:49.200]  little bit in college I was pretty wild and I was like man I'm dating all these
[01:54:49.200 --> 01:54:53.400]  beautiful women I mean sometimes I was dating four or five different girls a
[01:54:53.400 --> 01:54:57.240]  week I was you know drinking hanging out with the coolest people and I was like
[01:54:57.240 --> 01:55:01.640]  this is unfulfilling but I was fulfilled when I was reading history and
[01:55:01.640 --> 01:55:05.680]  studying politics it was like the instinct was get involved you know be
[01:55:05.680 --> 01:55:11.120]  part of the human race build things I was fulfilled when I would paint a oil
[01:55:11.120 --> 01:55:17.240]  painting that that I mean I feel good when I finish a powerful film I feel
[01:55:17.240 --> 01:55:23.240]  fulfilled I felt good when I help an old lady you know open a door for I feel
[01:55:23.240 --> 01:55:31.720]  good when I gave that lady the Heimlich maneuver for quite frankly it felt good
[01:55:31.720 --> 01:55:34.400]  when I was a teenager and some bullied start a fight with me and I beat the
[01:55:34.400 --> 01:55:38.880]  living daylights out of them it feels good just to be a human and to be strong
[01:55:38.880 --> 01:55:43.080]  and not be so cowardly and again I'm not up here on some high horse saying how
[01:55:43.080 --> 01:55:48.320]  great I am but more and more I realize it's that the public has been engineered
[01:55:48.320 --> 01:55:53.120]  and turned into these pathetic slugs who think they're pathetic but at the same
[01:55:53.120 --> 01:55:57.560]  time have I have like a power trip attitude it's really weird I know you've
[01:55:57.560 --> 01:56:00.920]  noticed it I know you've seen it and you know I may seem like a bull in a
[01:56:00.920 --> 01:56:07.240]  china closet mad dog to some people because I'm just alive ladies and
[01:56:07.240 --> 01:56:16.280]  gentlemen and and I can't imagine people who aren't alive now I totally get
[01:56:16.280 --> 01:56:19.320]  people that want to join the military and people that want to rock climb and
[01:56:19.320 --> 01:56:22.160]  people that want to do dangerous things or people that want to be industrial
[01:56:22.160 --> 01:56:26.000]  divers because I've met a lot of those people and I realized that they're just
[01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:29.560]  like me and they're like look you know I want to go out and risk my life I want
[01:56:29.560 --> 01:56:35.440]  to be in danger I want to carry a 70 pound pack for 50 miles because I want
[01:56:35.440 --> 01:56:40.760]  to be tested I don't want to be like the rest of these people even if it's an
[01:56:40.760 --> 01:56:44.120]  evil military they still want to be part of something dangerous because it's
[01:56:44.120 --> 01:56:46.880]  better to be out there involved in something dangerous than to be a
[01:56:46.880 --> 01:56:51.480]  soulless jellyfish I'm beginning to really understand things more and more
[01:56:51.480 --> 01:56:58.000]  and I see this in front of me all about me college kids lack empathy compared to
[01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:03.080]  30 years ago it's all about me now study finds well don't you understand that
[01:57:03.080 --> 01:57:10.160]  that's a hellish system when everybody only cares about themselves then nobody
[01:57:10.160 --> 01:57:15.080]  cares about you I mean look at us we don't take care of our grandparents our
[01:57:15.080 --> 01:57:19.560]  parents anymore most people I do my family does but we don't do as even as
[01:57:19.560 --> 01:57:22.440]  good a job as we could have I should have visited my grandfather more after
[01:57:22.440 --> 01:57:25.880]  two heart attacks and stroke you know he was at the nursing home and only saw
[01:57:25.880 --> 01:57:31.160]  him like once a month I should have gone to see him every week but my uncle you
[01:57:31.160 --> 01:57:36.200]  know moved to be close to him for that period and visit him every day the
[01:57:36.200 --> 01:57:40.440]  average person just wants to stick their poor old dad or mom their pop their mom
[01:57:40.440 --> 01:57:43.840]  in there don't even take care of them well who's gonna take care of you what
[01:57:43.840 --> 01:57:47.080]  does that say about you you don't want to hang around with your family you don't
[01:57:47.080 --> 01:57:50.240]  want to be with your family that's all people I want to be around and it's not
[01:57:50.240 --> 01:57:53.240]  because I particularly like my family sometimes it's because that's what I'm
[01:57:53.240 --> 01:57:58.400]  supposed to do as a human you understand that I'm a human I'm a human you
[01:57:58.400 --> 01:58:02.800]  understand I'm not great-looking I'm not even that smart I'm not proud of
[01:58:02.800 --> 01:58:07.400]  myself I'm a I'm a man though you understand that I'm a human being
[01:58:07.400 --> 01:58:12.120]  people declare war on me I declare war on them you understand that that's what
[01:58:12.120 --> 01:58:18.360]  it comes down to at the end of the day that's who we are and if you you know

[02:00:26.120 --> 02:00:30.920]  of my mouth look at the jellyfish that the New World Order has created once
[02:00:30.920 --> 02:00:35.080]  human now just mindless drones that respond to television and they are
[02:00:35.080 --> 02:00:42.600]  lukewarm jellyfish like leaves that blow where the wind takes them not me not me
[02:00:42.600 --> 02:00:47.960]  it is such a simple fundamental shift ladies and gentlemen towards liberty and
[02:00:47.960 --> 02:00:52.640]  towards humanity and towards the animating spirit of our savior that
[02:00:52.640 --> 02:00:57.080]  has created this universe and you will be free free of the fear free of the

[02:01:08.960 --> 02:01:16.080]  alright I said I go to your calls Chris May Dave Ted others Chris in Wisconsin
[02:01:16.080 --> 02:01:22.360]  you're on the air thanks for holding hello mr. Jones my name's Chris I'm 32
[02:01:22.360 --> 02:01:26.960]  I've been waking up since I was 16 so we've been on similar path for similar
[02:01:26.960 --> 02:01:29.760]  amount of time and in that time I wish I could have found a way to discredit you
[02:01:29.760 --> 02:01:33.640]  but I can't and I discovered you when I was learning about peak oil and I thank
[02:01:33.640 --> 02:01:37.520]  you for exposing that but I have an idea your last comments were great
[02:01:37.520 --> 02:01:42.960]  segue into this point I have an idea all of the thousand cuts method of warfare
[02:01:42.960 --> 02:01:48.680]  for your listeners to fight back against this tyranny as based on the fail
[02:01:48.680 --> 02:01:54.960]  video meme that's popular now on YouTube is these videos other fail videos that
[02:01:54.960 --> 02:01:59.360]  just silly things that show people failing but I think that's a greatest
[02:01:59.360 --> 02:02:04.480]  failure that we see right now is that federal government the media and the
[02:02:04.480 --> 02:02:08.800]  great fail videos you know showing globalist and then saying didn't get
[02:02:08.800 --> 02:02:13.960]  their carbon tax fail yeah that's my challenge to your listeners is to not
[02:02:13.960 --> 02:02:16.720]  wait for you to have a contest but to start immediately those people who are
[02:02:16.720 --> 02:02:22.520]  adept at making YouTube videos to start infiltrating the co-opting the fail
[02:02:22.520 --> 02:02:26.640]  video movement well you know all the failed video movement so popular people
[02:02:26.640 --> 02:02:31.360]  like to see someone they think that has more wealth or power than them failing
[02:02:31.360 --> 02:02:36.760]  when I'm the opposite I want to see people who have talent and beauty and
[02:02:36.760 --> 02:02:42.800]  understanding I just love to see them and love to see their success but what
[02:02:42.800 --> 02:02:48.680]  I don't like is people using corruption to control and hurt innocent people I
[02:02:48.680 --> 02:02:54.840]  don't want to see those people fail I want to see them destroyed exactly right
[02:02:54.840 --> 02:02:58.320]  here and especially their bullies and one thing a bully can't stand is to be
[02:02:58.320 --> 02:03:04.040]  laughed at or mocked so to expose them and I have an example here that's 30
[02:03:04.040 --> 02:03:08.680]  seconds of what one of these videos might look like if I may go ahead
[02:03:08.680 --> 02:03:14.040]  okay this would be like the text on the screen on on March 30th I'm not sure
[02:03:14.040 --> 02:03:17.680]  on the date on March 30th the media terrorized nation by announcing that
[02:03:17.680 --> 02:03:21.120]  America was nearly attacked by an armed militia intent on taking over the
[02:03:21.120 --> 02:03:25.960]  government and the FBI stopped them just in time saving us all on March 31st it
[02:03:25.960 --> 02:03:29.960]  was revealed that the nine members of the Hutari militia
[02:03:29.960 --> 02:03:35.320]  the one go the only one were released and it was all fake and the government
[02:03:35.320 --> 02:03:39.960]  did it to try to sell propaganda they fail and when Chris Matthews does this
[02:03:39.960 --> 02:03:44.960]  hit piece on Rand Paul and myself next week of this big national special we

[02:04:06.760 --> 02:04:09.640]  blatantly staging an attack playing the victim and getting caught red-handed
[02:04:09.640 --> 02:04:13.160]  feeling to find a group who we could believe was a real threat or at least
[02:04:13.160 --> 02:04:17.800]  had more teeth than toes and using the event as an excuse to attack gun owners
[02:04:17.800 --> 02:04:20.920]  and further violate their oath to the Constitution Bill rights federal

[02:09:12.480 --> 02:09:15.920]  a few calls here may in florida you're on the air welcome
[02:09:15.920 --> 02:09:20.240]  hi i'm calling from panama city and we don't have the oil yet but it's starting
[02:09:20.240 --> 02:09:22.640]  to come through the past they understand
[02:09:22.640 --> 02:09:29.200]  um i want you to hear about the company called nowco
[02:09:29.200 --> 02:09:35.280]  it is the maker of the dispersant that vp is using it is toxic it is banned in
[02:09:35.280 --> 02:09:40.240]  europe it is uh... it has tentacles it has
[02:09:40.240 --> 02:09:43.680]  warren buffett morris strong al gore sorus
[02:09:43.680 --> 02:09:47.840]  apollo black now i've seen that that's tied in the bigger chemical companies
[02:09:47.840 --> 02:09:52.160]  and it's super toxic compared to crude oil that is biodegradable i mean it's
[02:09:52.160 --> 02:09:56.320]  not great but crude oil compared to chemicals that they're dumping into it
[02:09:56.320 --> 02:10:00.160]  is is and that's why all the workers
[02:10:00.160 --> 02:10:03.840]  are getting sick that are out there being ordered to put this dispersant
[02:10:03.840 --> 02:10:07.760]  into the oil ordered not to speak when they're sick
[02:10:07.760 --> 02:10:13.760]  too and there is a better better one but it's not manufactured by nowco it's
[02:10:13.760 --> 02:10:17.360]  called dispersant it's less toxic it can be
[02:10:17.360 --> 02:10:20.480]  manufactured at sixty thousand gallons a day
[02:10:20.480 --> 02:10:23.440]  and they don't want to they don't want to know about it
[02:10:23.440 --> 02:10:27.280]  and uh... what about the bacteria of the spin
[02:10:27.280 --> 02:10:30.800]  by mainstream news is well there's natural
[02:10:30.800 --> 02:10:34.080]  bacteria they're going to eat mostly oil anyway well that's true
[02:10:34.080 --> 02:10:37.600]  but why aren't they out there from day one spraying
[02:10:37.600 --> 02:10:41.520]  uh... the bacteria they've got on top of it which have no environmental impact
[02:10:41.520 --> 02:10:44.960]  uh... they're not really even engineered they've just been bred
[02:10:44.960 --> 02:10:48.400]  uh... to gobble up the oil and then they reproduce in the oil
[02:10:48.400 --> 02:10:52.720]  but you've got to put it in early so that the bacteria go with the
[02:10:52.720 --> 02:10:56.160]  flows of oil it's hard once it's spread all over the gulf
[02:10:56.160 --> 02:11:00.800]  to then go put it in in pockets why did they do this
[02:11:00.800 --> 02:11:04.480]  they do it because of the of the money that they're not going to give up them
[02:11:04.480 --> 02:11:08.160]  they're going to make us absolutely dependent
[02:11:08.160 --> 02:11:12.000]  exactly and fema got more power fema got more power
[02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:16.080]  off of what happened with katrina by screwing up sorry go ahead
[02:11:16.080 --> 02:11:19.200]  it's all about cap and trade they're going to push this through
[02:11:19.200 --> 02:11:23.200]  and isn't it convenient that al goy left the picture because he's getting a
[02:11:23.200 --> 02:11:26.560]  divorce just during this uh... this crisis
[02:11:26.560 --> 02:11:32.560]  where is he i'm i i used to dive in the florida keys
[02:11:32.560 --> 02:11:37.360]  i'm sixty seven years old and i have a blog and i
[02:11:37.360 --> 02:11:40.720]  beat the government up every day and i use a lot of your material and we
[02:11:40.720 --> 02:11:43.440]  listened to you two three maybe
[02:11:43.440 --> 02:11:47.600]  maybe three times a day and so we're doing our part
[02:11:47.600 --> 02:11:52.320]  but this is a this is a terrible thing and it wasn't i don't believe it was an
[02:11:52.320 --> 02:11:55.440]  accident i just don't believe it ma'am
[02:11:55.440 --> 02:11:59.520]  the thank you and i think your instinct and research is on target we just had
[02:11:59.520 --> 02:12:03.840]  the big report go up this is a four or five days of
[02:12:03.840 --> 02:12:07.440]  writing and research a month of research that goes into this we've been
[02:12:07.440 --> 02:12:10.880]  writing this over the last well since last uh... friday so
[02:12:10.880 --> 02:12:14.480]  four days evidence points to bp oil spill
[02:12:14.480 --> 02:12:19.600]  false flag evidence points to bp oil spill false flag
[02:12:19.600 --> 02:12:24.960]  now the problem is google is so immoral you can buy the search term
[02:12:24.960 --> 02:12:28.800]  and so they're spending millions of dollars a day to have the first four
[02:12:28.800 --> 02:12:32.480]  pages if you go to google and we'll do this live on prison planet dot tv
[02:12:32.480 --> 02:12:36.080]  right now and if you type in bp just the letters bp
[02:12:36.080 --> 02:12:39.680]  or british petroleum and we'll do that live on tv for folks watching but
[02:12:39.680 --> 02:12:45.200]  anybody can do this online and every page is bp.com
[02:12:45.200 --> 02:12:51.920]  or their subsidiaries i mean keep scrolling down bp bp
[02:12:51.920 --> 02:12:55.920]  it is just just amazing uh... that
[02:12:55.920 --> 02:12:59.440]  that they are controlling what type of news
[02:12:59.440 --> 02:13:06.880]  uh... is able to make it in there and they bought the term oil spill
[02:13:06.880 --> 02:13:09.920]  now what's interesting is i did this last night this morning at my house in the
[02:13:09.920 --> 02:13:12.160]  first three or four pages had no one in it
[02:13:12.160 --> 02:13:15.600]  uh... the top ones here are bp but some of them actually are new york times and
[02:13:15.600 --> 02:13:18.480]  and others i don't know how they're uh...
[02:13:18.480 --> 02:13:21.040]  i guess google might have gotten embarrassed by this it must have just
[02:13:21.040 --> 02:13:24.880]  changed it but still they're dominating but i mean it was nothing but bp.com
[02:13:24.880 --> 02:13:27.840]  bp.com bp.com bp world bp you know
[02:13:27.840 --> 02:13:32.320]  different subsidiary websites this page after page their propaganda
[02:13:32.320 --> 02:13:35.760]  uh... and and and there's also a news blackout on the fact that there's a news
[02:13:35.760 --> 02:13:40.320]  blackout three weeks ago i had cbs news footage we
[02:13:40.320 --> 02:13:44.080]  plug clips here uh... where they were trying to go to public beaches in
[02:13:44.080 --> 02:13:47.600]  louisiana and armed men would pull up and say you're not allowed to be here
[02:13:47.600 --> 02:13:51.840]  orders of bp we'd say you know how how is this
[02:13:51.840 --> 02:13:55.040]  continuing to happen and you know the answer is they're just getting away
[02:13:55.040 --> 02:13:59.920]  with it and so we've got the satellite photos folks and the
[02:13:59.920 --> 02:14:03.520]  good news is most of it staying far out to see
[02:14:03.520 --> 02:14:07.280]  and is it the problem is it's going to go around florida and hit the keys it is
[02:14:07.280 --> 02:14:12.320]  going to really hurt the keys but minus the keys you know the western coast of
[02:14:12.320 --> 02:14:16.080]  florida uh... it is uh...
[02:14:16.080 --> 02:14:19.200]  going to get hit some when it comes back around the eastern coast is going to get
[02:14:19.200 --> 02:14:21.920]  hit some uh... but uh... from what i've seen in the
[02:14:21.920 --> 02:14:25.360]  satellite the images and then the computer models
[02:14:25.360 --> 02:14:29.440]  uh... of how those uh... currents flow it could be a lot worse the problem is
[02:14:29.440 --> 02:14:31.840]  that they don't get this fixed the next month or two
[02:14:31.840 --> 02:14:35.520]  ladies and gentlemen when that when those hurricanes hit then the flow
[02:14:35.520 --> 02:14:38.720]  completely changes and it just drives it into land
[02:14:38.720 --> 02:14:44.000]  and you're going to have it's tens of millions of gallons now
[02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:48.480]  what is it a half million a day and it's 40-something days and we're talking
[02:14:48.480 --> 02:14:52.000]  hundreds of millions of gallons is going to be hitting and then you got a
[02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:55.920]  problem you got a big problem they should have burned
[02:14:55.920 --> 02:14:59.600]  that off they should have been out there dropping napalm on it to keep it
[02:14:59.600 --> 02:15:03.360]  burning from day one they should have kept and that's the
[02:15:03.360 --> 02:15:05.600]  old way they've had lots of oil spills folks
[02:15:05.600 --> 02:15:11.120]  you burn them yep yep you set them on fire folks
[02:15:11.120 --> 02:15:15.920]  then it's just black smoke what do you do uh... let's go ahead and talk to uh...
[02:15:15.920 --> 02:15:19.280]  david michigan david on the air
[02:15:19.280 --> 02:15:23.040]  hi alex uh... guarding gold ship gears a little bit
[02:15:23.040 --> 02:15:27.440]  i uh... recently been noticing a lot of tv commercials and found a lot of
[02:15:27.440 --> 02:15:32.880]  websites that are offering this cash for gold and my first thought about that was
[02:15:32.880 --> 02:15:35.040]  when seeing all this push for this
[02:15:35.040 --> 02:15:39.600]  it could just be a plot to extract you know a precious medal of real value
[02:15:39.600 --> 02:15:43.200]  from the public and leave them with worthless fiat currency i was wondering
[02:15:43.200 --> 02:15:46.480]  what you and maybe even ted anderson's take would be on this whole cash for
[02:15:46.480 --> 02:15:50.480]  gold thing by the way david this is not a set up call we didn't tell you to call
[02:15:50.480 --> 02:15:54.160]  correct uh... no no i've been wondering about this
[02:15:54.160 --> 02:15:57.040]  for a while and in fact when you've had ted anderson on

[02:16:07.200 --> 02:16:11.760]  moment poor ted i get wound up folks so wound up i don't

[02:16:25.200 --> 02:16:27.760]  one oh five now it's one sixteen we're live
[02:16:27.760 --> 02:16:32.240]  here on this uh... tuesday edition ted's been sitting there politely off and on
[02:16:32.240 --> 02:16:35.920]  for an hour waiting to come on uh... and so i can bring him up to answer your
[02:16:35.920 --> 02:16:39.040]  question i was wanting to get your calls and then
[02:16:39.040 --> 02:16:42.160]  get into all this economic news tax hikes and the
[02:16:42.160 --> 02:16:45.840]  twenty eleven economic collapse wall street journal
[02:16:45.840 --> 02:16:50.320]  uh... investment banker it's going to get nasty by land barbed wire and guns
[02:16:50.320 --> 02:16:54.480]  i'm gonna cover that when we come back as now's the time to get into this
[02:16:54.480 --> 02:16:58.880]  but and and and the oil spill is serving at many levels
[02:16:58.880 --> 02:17:04.000]  as a political distraction for all of this the overall global financial
[02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:08.080]  uh... military takeover that's happening but absolutely you're going to see
[02:17:08.080 --> 02:17:12.160]  gold ads everywhere selling gold because gold's a hot commodity
[02:17:12.160 --> 02:17:17.120]  and the best performing investment overall in the last seven years
[02:17:17.120 --> 02:17:22.160]  but you're also go everywhere i see these ads for will buy your junk gold and i
[02:17:22.160 --> 02:17:25.040]  and i've seen they pay about half of what it's worth
[02:17:25.040 --> 02:17:29.360]  and then they melt it down and sell it to the big gold companies who then turned
[02:17:29.360 --> 02:17:32.800]  into coins or ingots and sell it back to you at a premium
[02:17:32.800 --> 02:17:37.600]  uh... show yes other more reputable places that do it
[02:17:37.600 --> 02:17:41.520]  uh... but still they deserve some markup to pay for their mortar and their taxes
[02:17:41.520 --> 02:17:45.360]  and their employees but uh... they shouldn't pay you under about ten
[02:17:45.360 --> 02:17:49.520]  percent of what gold's worth i've been told by the industry that's a
[02:17:49.520 --> 02:17:52.800]  good deal it's not already in coin form because they've got to then get it
[02:17:52.800 --> 02:17:56.480]  certified they've been got to sell it uh... who they're selling it to you know
[02:17:56.480 --> 02:18:00.080]  doesn't give them full market value either so that's a pretty good deal if
[02:18:00.080 --> 02:18:03.120]  you're getting within ten percent if you're getting ninety percent of its
[02:18:03.120 --> 02:18:06.240]  value but you've got to know how to value it
[02:18:06.240 --> 02:18:10.000]  uh... so yes that's why you see ads everywhere because they can't mine enough
[02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:12.960]  gold men's are running out all over the world
[02:18:12.960 --> 02:18:15.600]  um...
[02:18:15.600 --> 02:18:20.000]  the real market has gold on average about two hundred dollars
[02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:23.680]  even for the uh... coins that haven't been very popular cruegerans
[02:18:23.680 --> 02:18:27.200]  are one of the most unpopular coins in history because they're connected to the
[02:18:27.200 --> 02:18:28.880]  south african regime
[02:18:28.880 --> 02:18:32.400]  well cruegerans are sold out right now in many areas and there's giant premiums
[02:18:32.400 --> 02:18:33.200]  on them
[02:18:33.200 --> 02:18:35.760]  okay and and and uh...
[02:18:35.760 --> 02:18:38.960]  same things that are seen as quite plentiful british sovereigns
[02:18:38.960 --> 02:18:40.640]  uh... can't get them
[02:18:40.640 --> 02:18:42.000]  or there's huge premiums
[02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:46.240]  maple leafs can't get them or huge premiums uh... u.s. buffaloes can't get
[02:18:46.240 --> 02:18:47.840]  them or their giant premiums
[02:18:47.840 --> 02:18:51.040]  uh... because they're selling out everywhere so see that the bankers are
[02:18:51.040 --> 02:18:53.840]  trying to suppress gold but they're not successful
[02:18:53.840 --> 02:18:57.440]  but to a certain extent they are because gold in the real markets
[02:18:57.440 --> 02:19:00.520]  fifteen hundred dollars an ounce fourteen fifty
[02:19:00.520 --> 02:19:01.480]  at its low
[02:19:01.480 --> 02:19:02.920]  but they're telling you it's
[02:19:02.920 --> 02:19:06.200]  you know uh... one thousand two hundred and fifty right now let's bring
[02:19:06.200 --> 02:19:07.680]  ted Anderson up briefly
[02:19:07.680 --> 02:19:10.080]  ted do you agree with my analysis there
[02:19:10.080 --> 02:19:14.600]  yes sure do i tell you you see this happening where people uh...
[02:19:14.600 --> 02:19:17.040]  will set up shops to buy jewelry
[02:19:17.040 --> 02:19:20.760]  and uh... what would they call it scrap gold as a matter of fact in nineteen
[02:19:20.760 --> 02:19:23.200]  eighty it happened to one of the market search
[02:19:23.200 --> 02:19:26.040]  uh... there are a lot of people that you know need money and they'll sell their
[02:19:26.040 --> 02:19:28.800]  old rings or dental or whatever they have
[02:19:28.800 --> 02:19:32.400]  and it needs to be smelted and you're not going to get ninety percent because
[02:19:32.400 --> 02:19:35.360]  that's about what a dealer can get when they group all their gold together
[02:19:35.360 --> 02:19:37.400]  unless you have a large enough volume
[02:19:37.400 --> 02:19:40.440]  and then they'll sell it to a smelter have an assade
[02:19:40.440 --> 02:19:44.120]  you know there's fees and charges in that and then they turn it into bars and
[02:19:44.120 --> 02:19:45.880]  coins just like you said
[02:19:45.880 --> 02:19:47.840]  it's just recycling that's all
[02:19:47.840 --> 02:19:50.680]  uh... stay there but the issue is you don't get what your gold's really worth
[02:19:50.680 --> 02:19:51.720]  when you do that
[02:19:51.720 --> 02:19:54.880]  uh... stay there ted Anderson i want to come back to you talk about
[02:19:54.880 --> 02:19:57.080]  the explosion in the gold market today

[02:24:26.040 --> 02:24:31.240]  the video the troops killing the kids he's being charged
[02:24:31.240 --> 02:24:34.760]  and bush is giving speeches saying he tortured people again
[02:24:34.760 --> 02:24:37.880]  but our government sent people who followed his orders
[02:24:37.880 --> 02:24:42.280]  to prison for the torture but he's running around saying he would order
[02:24:42.280 --> 02:24:46.200]  torture again what's wrong with that picture
[02:24:46.200 --> 02:24:51.400]  two sets of rules but but i digress answering the caller's question on the
[02:24:51.400 --> 02:24:55.000]  gold uh is that caller still there john
[02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:58.680]  david michigan did that answer your question
[02:24:58.680 --> 02:25:02.440]  yeah pretty much and i also wanted to mention that i when i googled it
[02:25:02.440 --> 02:25:08.440]  is i found a ton of reviews of people commenting on how they were ripped off
[02:25:08.440 --> 02:25:12.280]  how the checks were very small compared to what they felt their gold was worth
[02:25:12.280 --> 02:25:15.720]  asking them go for the gold back and not getting it contacting the better
[02:25:15.720 --> 02:25:18.840]  business bureau bringing charges with their local police
[02:25:18.840 --> 02:25:23.240]  department it needs to be a real ripoff well i appreciate your call
[02:25:23.240 --> 02:25:26.680]  um again it varies there have been places
[02:25:26.680 --> 02:25:29.800]  normally you want to go to a reputable place that's been there for a long time
[02:25:29.800 --> 02:25:33.720]  who's in the business of buying junk gold back
[02:25:33.720 --> 02:25:37.240]  um obviously you're going to get people that are going to end up not giving you
[02:25:37.240 --> 02:25:41.000]  that much money for it but again they've got a business they got telephones
[02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:44.680]  they got taxes i mean people expect for some reason with gold that there's
[02:25:44.680 --> 02:25:47.960]  going to be no markup or in trading gold in that there's going to be
[02:25:47.960 --> 02:25:51.560]  you know no profit for them and people love to complain but i have no doubt
[02:25:51.560 --> 02:25:53.880]  there's scams out there but i'm glad we can answer your question
[02:25:53.880 --> 02:25:59.160]  the answer is to get high quality certified bullion or certified coins
[02:25:59.160 --> 02:26:04.760]  and to buy gold instead of selling gold and now is the time
[02:26:04.760 --> 02:26:08.600]  i mean ted anderson they're now in the wall street journal the new york time
[02:26:08.600 --> 02:26:13.400]  saying people are going to buy gold uh tell tell folks where gold is today
[02:26:13.400 --> 02:26:17.560]  yeah sure i'm gold hit a peak that it's never seen before today so far at 12
[02:26:17.560 --> 02:26:21.640]  52 30 also it did break its previous us record excuse me
[02:26:21.640 --> 02:26:25.800]  it did but it hasn't closed at that so usually when they when they say gold
[02:26:25.800 --> 02:26:29.560]  hit a record peak they go off the close so the market's still open
[02:26:29.560 --> 02:26:33.480]  but we the last peak was 12 51 and change and now it's
[02:26:33.480 --> 02:26:38.680]  seeing a high of 12 52 30 so right now presently 1244 20
[02:26:38.680 --> 02:26:43.320]  so yeah it's it's definitely strong today elix and people are buying because
[02:26:43.320 --> 02:26:46.920]  they want security they want to get out of paper currency
[02:26:46.920 --> 02:26:50.520]  and they want to hold on to gold your callers right i mean there's a lot of
[02:26:50.520 --> 02:26:53.160]  people that do get ripped off out there
[02:26:53.160 --> 02:26:57.240]  you know and you you know you really have to be aware because just about
[02:26:57.240 --> 02:27:00.600]  you know there's so many people that come out of the woodwork to buy you know
[02:27:00.600 --> 02:27:03.960]  people's jewelry and it and it can get to be really ugly so yeah but that
[02:27:03.960 --> 02:27:07.560]  digresses us down a rabbit trail but i'm glad we can answer that
[02:27:07.560 --> 02:27:11.640]  uh we're not in the junk gold business folks we're in the business of
[02:27:11.640 --> 02:27:16.760]  selling you gold not not not not buying your gold though ted you do buy people's
[02:27:16.760 --> 02:27:21.080]  gold back don't you we sure do um and you're right i'm not in the scrap
[02:27:21.080 --> 02:27:24.040]  business if somebody needed to sell me scrap they could
[02:27:24.040 --> 02:27:28.680]  but that's not my particular goal i handle coins that are very recognizable
[02:27:28.680 --> 02:27:32.760]  like the british sovereign the frank the us eagle we just picked up a
[02:27:32.760 --> 02:27:37.960]  supply of buffaloes by the way you know those are coins oh excuse me i want one
[02:27:37.960 --> 02:27:40.760]  of those uh you you got some buffaloes in
[02:27:40.760 --> 02:27:44.760]  yep we did yeah we were able to secure a nice supply of those now ted i read in
[02:27:44.760 --> 02:27:47.480]  the news anybody can go google this and search it
[02:27:47.480 --> 02:27:53.960]  that there's huge premiums you know gold is $1,242 uh right now you know
[02:27:53.960 --> 02:27:57.080]  at its all-time high in the u.s all-time high in europe
[02:27:57.080 --> 02:28:01.240]  but that's not what coin companies are selling it for i mean there's
[02:28:01.240 --> 02:28:07.400]  i've seen huge uh you know $200 premiums on an ounce of gold that is bullion
[02:28:07.400 --> 02:28:12.360]  class uh but so how are you able to sell it lower than that
[02:28:12.360 --> 02:28:15.480]  and i know the answer you bought it when it was lower you're still selling it
[02:28:15.480 --> 02:28:18.040]  even though gold's higher with the discount
[02:28:18.040 --> 02:28:21.160]  well that you know that's what i obviously that's what i try to do i'm
[02:28:21.160 --> 02:28:24.760]  not getting a lot of opportunity right now because you know of this last
[02:28:24.760 --> 02:28:29.000]  little dip that came along i only had about two or three days to stock up
[02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:33.320]  but uh yeah that's what i do what happens is when people put
[02:28:33.320 --> 02:28:37.400]  demand on a finite supply like british sovereign for example
[02:28:37.400 --> 02:28:41.400]  they're not making those anymore they're made back in the early 1900s
[02:28:41.400 --> 02:28:45.720]  the the supply that's there is it when people come into the marketplace
[02:28:45.720 --> 02:28:49.320]  with literally billions of dollars to buy gold coins
[02:28:49.320 --> 02:28:52.120]  you know you're putting a lot of pressure on a coin and what and and they
[02:28:52.120 --> 02:28:55.640]  start bidding up the premiums you you know people see it on ebay they see it
[02:28:55.640 --> 02:28:59.240]  everywhere it's the same thing you have supply and then you have demand
[02:28:59.240 --> 02:29:02.840]  and now the russian government the iranians others are pouring in the
[02:29:02.840 --> 02:29:06.600]  indians the japanese the chinese europeans who always
[02:29:06.600 --> 02:29:10.600]  look down their nose at gold they like big socialist governments
[02:29:10.600 --> 02:29:14.200]  uh and boy look how that uh ended up for them
[02:29:14.200 --> 02:29:17.560]  uh and you've got all these open announcements of collapse i hope we
[02:29:17.560 --> 02:29:21.240]  aren't going to have a full collapse but by and large nafta and gatt has already
[02:29:21.240 --> 02:29:24.200]  collapsed our industry it's already collapsed our society

[02:31:12.280 --> 02:31:15.560]  democracy not mob rule two wolves and a sheep voting on
[02:31:15.560 --> 02:31:17.960]  what's for dinner so they think they own our land
[02:31:17.960 --> 02:31:21.880]  they think they're on our water children our education our money
[02:31:21.880 --> 02:31:25.880]  we have to define who we are and what we will tolerate

[02:32:03.160 --> 02:32:06.360]  power generator number one new climate legislation
[02:32:06.360 --> 02:32:08.600]  could easily double or triple your electric bill
[02:32:08.600 --> 02:32:12.840]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[02:32:12.840 --> 02:32:16.440]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[02:32:16.440 --> 02:32:19.880]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[02:32:19.880 --> 02:32:23.560]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[02:32:23.560 --> 02:32:26.600]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[02:32:26.600 --> 02:32:30.440]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[02:32:30.440 --> 02:32:33.800]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[02:32:33.800 --> 02:32:37.560]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator
[02:32:37.560 --> 02:32:40.440]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[02:32:40.440 --> 02:32:43.480]  folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[02:32:43.480 --> 02:32:46.200]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more
[02:32:46.200 --> 02:32:51.480]  information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's mysolarbackup.com
[02:32:51.480 --> 02:32:55.560]  remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to mysolarbackup.com
[02:32:55.560 --> 02:33:00.840]  or call 1-877-327-0365
[02:33:09.640 --> 02:33:12.040]  yeah
[02:33:14.520 --> 02:33:18.200]  now they grow it on the moon and eat it raw
[02:33:18.200 --> 02:33:23.160]  they used to grow food in kansas yeah now they grow it on the moon and eat it
[02:33:23.160 --> 02:33:27.000]  raw i can see a day when even having your
[02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:29.960]  own garden will be against the law they're now passing laws all over the
[02:33:29.960 --> 02:33:32.360]  world
[02:33:33.160 --> 02:33:38.680]  even an oklahoma they're trying to ban gardens because you might grow pot
[02:33:38.680 --> 02:33:42.440]  you'd have a police inspection you don't we don't let prisoners you're a
[02:33:42.440 --> 02:33:46.360]  prisoner of the new world order we don't let you grow plants without
[02:33:46.360 --> 02:33:50.840]  an inspection democracy don't rule the world
[02:33:50.840 --> 02:33:54.840]  you better get that through your head
[02:33:57.400 --> 02:34:00.840]  you know bob doing is a patriot it's all about the new world order
[02:34:00.840 --> 02:34:06.680]  just gonna let you know that i can't tell you how i know but
[02:34:06.680 --> 02:34:11.480]  but a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do
[02:34:12.760 --> 02:34:16.840]  that's a lot of real estate indeed
[02:34:16.840 --> 02:34:22.760]  all right i'm gonna go to your calls and a bunch of other news
[02:34:22.760 --> 02:34:26.040]  it's just this is such heavy subjects i gotta have some fun with it
[02:34:26.040 --> 02:34:29.240]  it's gallows humor you know when you're about to be hung
[02:34:29.240 --> 02:34:33.720]  a lot of men it was written in the annals especially in england would
[02:34:33.720 --> 02:34:38.360]  either beg and plead or they would be quiet or they would say prayers or they
[02:34:38.360 --> 02:34:45.400]  would make jokes and have fun and enjoy themselves
[02:34:45.400 --> 02:34:48.840]  and many of the reports are they would look up at the sky
[02:34:48.840 --> 02:34:53.800]  take a big delicious breath of fresh air before they
[02:34:53.800 --> 02:34:57.800]  got their neck snapped at the end of a rope
[02:34:57.800 --> 02:35:01.320]  and so i try to be positive because i go crazy if i wasn't i mean i live in a
[02:35:01.320 --> 02:35:04.360]  country i live in a world run by a scientific dictatorship i know
[02:35:04.360 --> 02:35:07.240]  they're destroying the economy by design i know they're poisoning our food and
[02:35:07.240 --> 02:35:10.680]  water by design on record i know all the major gmo food
[02:35:10.680 --> 02:35:14.920]  lines sterilize every rat every guinea pig they feed it to
[02:35:14.920 --> 02:35:17.880]  and i know full well they're running their operation against us
[02:35:17.880 --> 02:35:22.600]  and and then that 99.9 percent of us are in the same boat together black white
[02:35:22.600 --> 02:35:27.720]  old young and that we hispanic jewish chinese
[02:35:27.720 --> 02:35:31.240]  whatever you are you're under attack and we better grow up
[02:35:31.240 --> 02:35:36.440]  and we better set the agenda us saying no to the new world order
[02:35:36.440 --> 02:35:39.320]  people say well that's all true why aren't you dead because there's too many
[02:35:39.320 --> 02:35:42.200]  of us speaking out because it would highlight everything i've said
[02:35:42.200 --> 02:35:46.040]  everything i've done somebody sent me a video of bill cooper who had his
[02:35:46.040 --> 02:35:48.600]  problems but he also was a talented radio hosting
[02:35:48.600 --> 02:35:52.440]  author and it was him saying why aren't i dead yet
[02:35:52.440 --> 02:35:58.360]  and he said basically what i've said uh that uh
[02:35:58.360 --> 02:36:01.640]  he would be a martyr it would then underline and highlight everything he'd
[02:36:01.640 --> 02:36:06.360]  said well in the end they did kill him
[02:36:06.360 --> 02:36:09.880]  and i certainly get my share of death threats so it could come at any time
[02:36:09.880 --> 02:36:16.120]  uh it's just uh you a man's got to do what a man's got to do
[02:36:16.120 --> 02:36:19.960]  and i'm gonna tell the truth i mean i couldn't sit here knowing this
[02:36:19.960 --> 02:36:23.240]  you know that's the biggest frustration is so many people know this
[02:36:23.240 --> 02:36:27.160]  information and they don't take action with it so many people go look it up and
[02:36:27.160 --> 02:36:30.920]  find out my gosh it's true every major gmo crop line from four different
[02:36:30.920 --> 02:36:35.080]  major companies sterilizes every mammal it comes in contact with totally
[02:36:35.080 --> 02:36:38.120]  fries them and gives them cancer attacks their liver
[02:36:38.120 --> 02:36:42.760]  let's go to dinner honey and feed the kids a
[02:36:42.760 --> 02:36:48.360]  bowl full of corn chips their gmo i mean you know what are we would you give
[02:36:48.360 --> 02:36:53.160]  your kid jack daniels every day and you mean you might as well
[02:36:53.160 --> 02:36:56.360]  it's better for their liver than than uh than uh
[02:36:56.360 --> 02:36:59.880]  many of the gmo food corn strains the majority of what we're eating
[02:36:59.880 --> 02:37:04.120]  look i'm already digressing it it at a certain point this is all i can talk
[02:37:04.120 --> 02:37:07.000]  about they're chem trailing us they're poisoning the food in the water
[02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:11.320]  it's now all admitted and people are running around freaking out about the
[02:37:11.320 --> 02:37:15.560]  gulf being hit by oil and they're using deadly chemicals far worse than the oil
[02:37:15.560 --> 02:37:17.800]  to do something about it but but i'm gonna shut up because i want to go to
[02:37:17.800 --> 02:37:21.240]  your calls ted ted i mean obviously
[02:37:21.240 --> 02:37:25.160]  minus resources owns the network and you're a big sponsor my show
[02:37:25.160 --> 02:37:28.680]  but i always get you on even when you're not sponsoring you know above and beyond
[02:37:28.680 --> 02:37:32.920]  your sponsorship because i buy gold i buy silver
[02:37:32.920 --> 02:37:36.040]  you know over the years i haven't had a lot of money but i bought some silver
[02:37:36.040 --> 02:37:40.200]  here's some gold there and gotten a a tidy hoard
[02:37:40.200 --> 02:37:43.240]  you know as an emergency backup everything implodes i'll have something i
[02:37:43.240 --> 02:37:46.120]  mean it's not a it's not a dragon's treasure or anything
[02:37:46.120 --> 02:37:50.200]  it's not captain kid's treasure but but i mean people that make decisions can
[02:37:50.200 --> 02:37:52.680]  get into golden silver and i happen to know because i've
[02:37:52.680 --> 02:37:56.600]  shopped i bought gold a few other places before and i found you've got the best
[02:37:56.600 --> 02:37:59.880]  deals when it's these specials you know you've got
[02:37:59.880 --> 02:38:02.760]  collector coins and other stuff that's available that are great deals but when
[02:38:02.760 --> 02:38:05.720]  it comes to bullion these are the best deals people are going to find tell
[02:38:05.720 --> 02:38:08.440]  people about the best coin offers you've got today
[02:38:08.440 --> 02:38:11.240]  and what you've got available as others are running out are putting huge
[02:38:11.240 --> 02:38:14.280]  premiums on it and when prices are going to go up
[02:38:14.280 --> 02:38:17.240]  how long you can hold it at this lower price
[02:38:17.240 --> 02:38:21.000]  well i mean obviously one of the great coins to be buying is that buffalo piece
[02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:24.840]  but we do have the frank it is uh and i'm just
[02:38:24.840 --> 02:38:28.840]  happy to be able to sell them actually they're at 265
[02:38:28.840 --> 02:38:33.720]  so the premium is actually low on them it's a fractional fractional piece of
[02:38:33.720 --> 02:38:38.200]  gold so you know when it comes down to barter and trade it's great for that
[02:38:38.200 --> 02:38:41.800]  and i'm not trying to be mead mean but the coin dealer that
[02:38:41.800 --> 02:38:46.120]  went back promotes it was in the news and i went and checked it was true
[02:38:46.120 --> 02:38:49.720]  six months ago when gold was a lot less was selling the same franks
[02:38:49.720 --> 02:38:53.720]  for 360 dollars a piece well and it's not just that gold dealer
[02:38:53.720 --> 02:38:57.000]  they're across the united states let's explain you have it
[02:38:57.000 --> 02:39:01.400]  256 and i haven't gotten the sheet lately but normally when i see these
[02:39:01.400 --> 02:39:05.080]  franks you're making four dollars on them and that's when you
[02:39:05.080 --> 02:39:09.800]  bought them when it was lower and they're just they're just a touch
[02:39:09.800 --> 02:39:13.880]  higher than that right now they're 265 oh 265 so they've gone up a bit
[02:39:13.880 --> 02:39:17.160]  yeah just a little bit i mean but look at gold i mean what has gone on there i
[02:39:17.160 --> 02:39:20.840]  mean gold has hit a peak that it's never seen well that's better than 360
[02:39:20.840 --> 02:39:24.040]  oh absolutely it's a huge discount to what's going on out there in the real
[02:39:24.040 --> 02:39:27.560]  world but the same thing is that you know if you buy one of these coins i'm
[02:39:27.560 --> 02:39:31.320]  going to buy a bob Chapman's international forecaster for a year
[02:39:31.320 --> 02:39:36.280]  yeah that's 156 dollars right there subtract that from the cost of the coin
[02:39:36.280 --> 02:39:39.640]  i mean you come up for about 500 dollars an ounce for gold
[02:39:39.640 --> 02:39:43.560]  i mean you can't you could buy gold at 500 dollars an ounce anymore
[02:39:43.560 --> 02:39:47.240]  you'd have to go back about 10 years to find gold at that price
[02:39:47.240 --> 02:39:51.800]  and uh and so that is just a fabulous buy and then of course the walking
[02:39:51.800 --> 02:39:56.040]  liberty halves are great at 975 uh you know gold now
[02:39:56.040 --> 02:40:01.480]  approaching 1300 dollars an ounce and older you know 100 year old 20 dollar
[02:40:01.480 --> 02:40:04.920]  liberties that were used here as currency as money they call those new
[02:40:04.920 --> 02:40:09.080]  mathematics now but they do contain just short of an ounce of gold
[02:40:09.080 --> 02:40:13.320]  they're at 1500 and 18 dollars i was able to lower their price even though
[02:40:13.320 --> 02:40:17.160]  gold has gone up uh you know let's explain you're a big
[02:40:17.160 --> 02:40:20.840]  golden silver dealer you don't buy this stuff at
[02:40:20.840 --> 02:40:24.520]  what the melt price is some people because there's some dealers that claim
[02:40:24.520 --> 02:40:29.240]  we have it at melt that's not true okay uh so there's a lot of bait and
[02:40:29.240 --> 02:40:32.920]  switching the best deals i found are ted anderson 800
[02:40:32.920 --> 02:40:36.360]  686 2237 we usually spend a few minutes once or
[02:40:36.360 --> 02:40:38.680]  twice a week on this but we're spending a lot more time today
[02:40:38.680 --> 02:40:41.640]  because this is big news gold at all time high
[02:40:41.640 --> 02:40:45.080]  in the u.s and in europe we'll see if it closes at that
[02:40:45.080 --> 02:40:47.640]  but regardless they're not going to be able to suppress the price
[02:40:47.640 --> 02:40:51.880]  much longer they have been unsuccessful and the market is trading way higher
[02:40:51.880 --> 02:40:57.160]  than what's supposed unattainable uh spot gold is at so we're seeing this is a
[02:40:57.160 --> 02:41:00.920]  rigged market right now now more than ever even the rigged market
[02:41:00.920 --> 02:41:04.760]  is going up in price but the real market is what ted am i right just from
[02:41:04.760 --> 02:41:08.920]  watching and this is my layman's analysis gold selling 200 300
[02:41:08.920 --> 02:41:12.360]  dollars more an ounce even for bullion than what the market
[02:41:12.360 --> 02:41:16.200]  says spot gold is there are most certainly cases of that that that's
[02:41:16.200 --> 02:41:20.120]  true um most of the stuff that i have right now
[02:41:20.120 --> 02:41:24.520]  is going to be closer to somewhere between 40
[02:41:24.520 --> 02:41:28.200]  maybe 50 over spot but there are some certain
[02:41:28.200 --> 02:41:32.200]  there's circumstances like take that take that uh british sovereign right now
[02:41:32.200 --> 02:41:34.920]  they've shot up like crazy and there's just no supply
[02:41:34.920 --> 02:41:38.600]  don't want to see reports of the american angels for 1500 bucks and i see
[02:41:38.600 --> 02:41:42.040]  gold at 1242 so i'm trying to figure that out
[02:41:42.040 --> 02:41:45.320]  yeah you definitely are seeing a lot of that out there right okay but to be
[02:41:45.320 --> 02:41:52.280]  clear then uh you've got um frank's that are 265
[02:41:52.280 --> 02:41:55.960]  yeah 265 a piece there a fifth of an ounce of gold
[02:41:55.960 --> 02:41:59.160]  so you take five of them to make an ounce so there is a little bit of a premium
[02:41:59.160 --> 02:42:03.960]  over spot but you have a smaller piece and fractional gold coins always carry a
[02:42:03.960 --> 02:42:06.680]  premium and in order to help you with that premium
[02:42:06.680 --> 02:42:10.520]  we're buying a full year subscription to bob Chapman's and then what are some of
[02:42:10.520 --> 02:42:13.480]  the other coins that we know you have the buffaloes that are really hard to get
[02:42:13.480 --> 02:42:17.640]  what other coins have you gotten well then of course you can get the u.s eagle
[02:42:17.640 --> 02:42:21.720]  and they're just trading just a little over 1300 a piece
[02:42:21.720 --> 02:42:26.840]  and then the walking liberty half 975 those on the internet at well over 10
[02:42:26.840 --> 02:42:31.880]  dollars now um Lakota nations at 2355 uh that's a
[02:42:31.880 --> 02:42:35.080]  goodbye because silver's been running up and those who are sitting at about 25
[02:42:35.080 --> 02:42:39.240]  bucks are just a short time ago uh plus you're supporting a
[02:42:39.240 --> 02:42:42.920]  patriotic network don't wait folks i believe you should get involved in
[02:42:42.920 --> 02:42:46.600]  golden silver i have personally and it's really done well for me

[02:43:43.160 --> 02:43:47.960]  before the hour ends but let me get into this economic news right now
[02:43:47.960 --> 02:43:51.080]  in fact we have that msnbc clip with the guy talking about buy
[02:43:51.080 --> 02:43:54.520]  buy land and bar bar we have that queued up
[02:43:54.520 --> 02:43:58.200]  or we're gonna play that in a moment and again this is just two articles
[02:43:58.200 --> 02:44:03.240]  i've got a whole bunch of these today uh this is out of the wall street journal
[02:44:03.240 --> 02:44:07.000]  tax hikes and the 2011 economic collapse
[02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:10.760]  today's corporate profits reflect an income shift in 2010
[02:44:10.760 --> 02:44:14.600]  these profits will tumble next year
[02:44:14.680 --> 02:44:18.120]  proceeded most likely by the stock market so the stock market will most
[02:44:18.120 --> 02:44:21.720]  likely tumble and this is the wall street journal
[02:44:21.720 --> 02:44:27.080]  arthur laffer is very respected people can change the volume the location and
[02:44:27.080 --> 02:44:30.440]  the composition of their income and they can do so in response to changes in
[02:44:30.440 --> 02:44:33.720]  government policies it shouldn't surprise anyone that the nine states
[02:44:33.720 --> 02:44:37.960]  with an income tax are growing far faster and attracting
[02:44:37.960 --> 02:44:41.400]  it shouldn't surprise you the nine states without excuse me
[02:44:41.400 --> 02:44:46.760]  without a income tax are growing far faster and attracting more people than
[02:44:46.760 --> 02:44:50.520]  the nine states with the highest income tax people and businesses
[02:44:50.520 --> 02:44:53.880]  are changing the location of income based on incentives
[02:44:53.880 --> 02:44:56.920]  and then it just goes into how taxes have been raised all over the country and
[02:44:56.920 --> 02:45:01.320]  federally how california is bombing out and how
[02:45:01.320 --> 02:45:04.920]  when they raise taxes they destroy economies and they have graphs that
[02:45:04.920 --> 02:45:07.960]  show all of that and that is absolutely true
[02:45:07.960 --> 02:45:11.560]  and so but but but but taxes supposedly doesn't have an income tax
[02:45:11.560 --> 02:45:15.400]  they got a franchise tax they got a business tax they're raping the day
[02:45:15.400 --> 02:45:20.040]  lights out of us folks i mean it is disgusting
[02:45:20.040 --> 02:45:24.440]  you ought to see the taxes i pay on the desk and the microphone
[02:45:24.440 --> 02:45:29.240]  it's a property taxes what it really is and it just makes me want to shut down
[02:45:29.240 --> 02:45:34.440]  but i can't because i got to fight the new world order
[02:45:34.440 --> 02:45:37.640]  i don't even want to make money i just want to pay for things
[02:45:37.640 --> 02:45:40.840]  and be able to run my operation and pay my employees
[02:45:40.840 --> 02:45:45.240]  but they've got an old rig now with all these new taxes where you pay taxes on
[02:45:45.240 --> 02:45:49.000]  everything and then it makes you want to not
[02:45:49.000 --> 02:45:52.280]  pay the taxes and then they get to throw you in prison
[02:45:52.280 --> 02:45:55.880]  and and and more and more the money goes to offshore banks it just all goes to
[02:45:55.880 --> 02:46:00.040]  them you know they raise your taxes they cut your supposed
[02:46:00.040 --> 02:46:06.200]  benefits they cut your supposed services you're seeing it everywhere
[02:46:06.200 --> 02:46:09.080]  this is the new world order model here's another one
[02:46:09.080 --> 02:46:13.400]  investment banker it's going to get nasty by land barbed wire and guns

[02:47:56.360 --> 02:48:00.120]  guns let's go ahead and play that clip um do we have it queued up to the spot we
[02:48:00.120 --> 02:48:02.680]  talked about the barbed wire and guns here it is
[02:48:02.680 --> 02:48:08.440]  is senior managing director at evercore partners an investment banker to his
[02:48:08.440 --> 02:48:13.240]  roots um do you think that uh tj and tm was given the right advice by his
[02:48:13.240 --> 02:48:16.760]  banking advisors that's a great one for first thing in the morning thank you
[02:48:16.760 --> 02:48:19.640]  for that i enjoyed that i enjoyed that hugely
[02:48:19.640 --> 02:48:23.800]  yes start strong um well i mean clearly the situation is in
[02:48:23.800 --> 02:48:27.080]  is incredibly messy now and i think the shareholders have put themselves into
[02:48:27.080 --> 02:48:29.720]  quite a tricky position i mean on the one hand everyone sort of
[02:48:29.720 --> 02:48:33.320]  all the newspapers all the coverages praising shareholders for standing up
[02:48:33.320 --> 02:48:36.280]  and saying we don't want to do this on the outhand what message does that send
[02:48:36.280 --> 02:48:39.720]  to management management of the board put forward a strategy
[02:48:39.720 --> 02:48:43.160]  shareholders rejected what are the shareholders now do do you sort of
[02:48:43.160 --> 02:48:47.880]  say to the managers well we may think your strategy is completely wrong
[02:48:47.880 --> 02:48:51.480]  but keep on going anyhow are they going to take some other action i think we
[02:48:51.480 --> 02:48:54.920]  come on that's a seven minute clip and i i thought i'd told him where to queue it
[02:48:54.920 --> 02:48:57.560]  up and i had is we're going to queue it up play it after the break
[02:48:57.560 --> 02:49:01.800]  the specific park is a seven minute clip it's up on prisonplanet.com if you
[02:49:01.800 --> 02:49:05.320]  want to watch the whole clip and also read the article by paul joseph
[02:49:05.320 --> 02:49:08.680]  watson this morning investment banker it's going to get nasty by
[02:49:08.680 --> 02:49:13.080]  land barbed wire and guns
[02:49:13.720 --> 02:49:16.840]  and what have we seen mayors and police chiefs and sheriffs
[02:49:16.840 --> 02:49:20.280]  from california to ohio saying the last two months
[02:49:20.280 --> 02:49:24.360]  we're laying off 47 percent we're laying off 65 percent
[02:49:24.360 --> 02:49:30.680]  you know we're going from 144 to 42 sheriff's deputies in the entire county
[02:49:30.680 --> 02:49:35.160]  and only three of them will be allowed each day one shift to respond to crime
[02:49:35.160 --> 02:49:38.520]  our other deputies will be writing tickets and raising money
[02:49:38.520 --> 02:49:43.960]  arm yourselves well what sheriff couldn't morally say arm yourselves
[02:49:43.960 --> 02:49:48.920]  arm yourselves the government isn't going to protect you
[02:49:48.920 --> 02:49:52.440]  and there is a serious potential for the complete
[02:49:52.440 --> 02:50:00.040]  and total collapse of society there is a serious potential for the complete
[02:50:00.040 --> 02:50:04.520]  collapse and i look i go back to basic numbers because this is the stuff
[02:50:04.520 --> 02:50:09.720]  keeping me up at night it's very elementary
[02:50:09.720 --> 02:50:13.400]  university studies show that millions and millions
[02:50:13.400 --> 02:50:17.320]  some studies as high as seven some even higher millions starved to death during
[02:50:17.320 --> 02:50:21.480]  the 10-year great depression with 90 percent or right at 90 percent of the
[02:50:21.480 --> 02:50:24.280]  public being agrarian living on the land being
[02:50:24.280 --> 02:50:28.120]  self-sufficient having chickens out back
[02:50:28.120 --> 02:50:32.120]  we're now almost 90 percent urban and don't know how to change
[02:50:32.120 --> 02:50:35.880]  our oil don't know how to plant a crop don't know how to pick our nose
[02:50:35.880 --> 02:50:38.600]  you know i mean we expect the government to send a special nose picker
[02:50:38.600 --> 02:50:42.120]  for us to do it uh what is going to happen
[02:50:42.120 --> 02:50:46.680]  if the depression continues we've already got 40 million americans on food
[02:50:46.680 --> 02:50:50.520]  stamps that's high-tech soup lines what is going to happen
[02:50:50.520 --> 02:50:54.280]  when the the there's only 10 percent that are self-sufficient
[02:50:54.280 --> 02:50:57.320]  and most of the rural people aren't self-sufficient it's more like five
[02:50:57.320 --> 02:51:00.920]  percent of the country what's going to happen
[02:51:00.920 --> 02:51:04.200]  here's a question if you have a septic system did you know that proper
[02:51:04.200 --> 02:51:07.480]  maintenance can save you thousands of dollars in costly and unnecessary

[02:54:25.000 --> 02:54:28.440]  hi i was um we got an article here you're gonna want to write down it just
[02:54:28.440 --> 02:54:31.880]  let that pen and pad ready ap enterprise
[02:54:31.880 --> 02:54:35.800]  sub attack was near u.s south korea drill
[02:54:35.800 --> 02:54:39.880]  keyword being drill and uh it says in this article here that
[02:54:39.880 --> 02:54:42.840]  two months after the sinking u.s officials for the first time disclose
[02:54:42.840 --> 02:54:48.200]  details of the joint naval exercise held the same day as the attack on the
[02:54:48.200 --> 02:54:51.000]  chenoin so you know wait no one said no actually
[02:54:51.000 --> 02:54:55.320]  knew two weeks ago uh that there was a drill and that it was
[02:54:55.320 --> 02:54:58.680]  right in a nest of u.s forces with deep-sea divers
[02:54:58.680 --> 02:55:02.440]  and they were doing some type of torpedo drill so uh the evidence is leaning
[02:55:02.440 --> 02:55:05.320]  towards another false flag because they because again
[02:55:05.320 --> 02:55:09.240]  the japanese government was about to throw us forces out now the prime minister
[02:55:09.240 --> 02:55:12.440]  resigned apologized and said your troops stay here
[02:55:12.440 --> 02:55:16.920]  please don't let north korea get us okay just make sure you didn't look over that
[02:55:16.920 --> 02:55:19.880]  no no no i'm glad you told me but i mean now they're admitting it huh
[02:55:19.880 --> 02:55:23.640]  uh what was that out of ap ap yeah the
[02:55:23.640 --> 02:55:30.920]  the title was ap enterprise sub attack was near u.s south korea drill
[02:55:30.920 --> 02:55:35.240]  and uh i wanted to see if you had a chance to see iron man too
[02:55:35.240 --> 02:55:39.320]  because in that movie the whole movie is pretty much about you know
[02:55:39.320 --> 02:55:43.160]  arms dealings but the whole movie they're talking about how
[02:55:43.160 --> 02:55:47.320]  uh tony stark is trying to stop weapons from being sold to north korea
[02:55:47.320 --> 02:55:50.920]  in iran there was only two countries mentioned in the whole
[02:55:50.920 --> 02:55:55.480]  movie about well i did it's funny you said that i did watch iron man last
[02:55:55.480 --> 02:55:58.040]  week on the treadmill in two different jogs
[02:55:58.040 --> 02:56:01.800]  and the entire film is pentagon propaganda placement
[02:56:01.800 --> 02:56:05.800]  and you can see where it's all paid for it is total mind control
[02:56:05.800 --> 02:56:11.720]  start to finish uh and uh you know pro afghan war so of course this movie is
[02:56:11.720 --> 02:56:15.240]  going to be right on time for iran and north korea
[02:56:15.240 --> 02:56:18.760]  just like they had the pearl harbor movie right before 9 11
[02:56:18.760 --> 02:56:24.360]  it's all queued up it's all staged uh and it's all part of mind control i
[02:56:24.360 --> 02:56:27.160]  appreciate your call no i haven't been out to the theater
[02:56:27.160 --> 02:56:30.120]  of the only movies i really watch now is when i'm on the treadmill because if i'm
[02:56:30.120 --> 02:56:33.640]  not watching movies i can't jog for more than 20 minutes but good
[02:56:33.640 --> 02:56:36.520]  i'm watching hurt locker right now i haven't seen the end of it yet it's
[02:56:36.520 --> 02:56:39.480]  pretty good actually uh i'm gonna finish jogging tonight
[02:56:39.480 --> 02:56:43.080]  i didn't have time this morning because i was on coast to coast last night so i
[02:56:43.080 --> 02:56:46.840]  had to get some shut out this morning couldn't get up too early uh mindless
[02:56:46.840 --> 02:56:51.080]  trivia why does that matter uh let's go ahead and talk to ted
[02:56:51.080 --> 02:56:55.160]  all right talk to ted quincy in california you're on the air
[02:56:55.160 --> 02:56:58.440]  i'll tell you i'll tell you i'll tell you i'm going to call it from we are
[02:56:58.440 --> 02:57:04.200]  change here east bay and um i'm i'm always
[02:57:04.200 --> 02:57:07.560]  passing out eating short after you're a stuff man
[02:57:07.560 --> 02:57:10.920]  every day so but i i just would like to do
[02:57:10.920 --> 02:57:15.880]  to say um as far as the as far as things are going
[02:57:15.880 --> 02:57:23.480]  could this possibly have been a mud volcano that bt might have hit
[02:57:23.480 --> 02:57:27.560]  and and the news might not be actually saying the
[02:57:27.560 --> 02:57:32.360]  truth what do you think on uh that theory sir
[02:57:32.360 --> 02:57:41.400]  say that again could could bt might have actually struck a mud volcano
[02:57:41.400 --> 02:57:45.960]  oh well i mean they do i mean i mean they do have uh
[02:57:45.960 --> 02:57:50.200]  under underwater volcanoes but there's more uh volcanoes because the earth
[02:57:50.200 --> 02:57:54.040]  75 covered by the atlantic and pacific oceans and
[02:57:54.040 --> 02:57:59.560]  arctic oceans and other oceans the seven seas the point is that yes
[02:57:59.560 --> 02:58:07.000]  they do have these big vents that do eject mud and oil and chemicals
[02:58:07.000 --> 02:58:11.560]  uh toxic compounds out of volcanoes that's another great point
[02:58:11.560 --> 02:58:15.640]  i mean this they need to plug it it is a problem
[02:58:15.640 --> 02:58:20.280]  but them shutting down the beaches shutting down the fishing
[02:58:20.280 --> 02:58:23.240]  uh and using toxic chemicals to disperse it
[02:58:23.240 --> 02:58:27.400]  is far worse than the oil itself from all the evidence i've seen that's a
[02:58:27.400 --> 02:58:30.120]  really great point uh and i appreciate your call
[02:58:30.120 --> 02:58:32.920]  quincy uh we'll come back i'll do five more minutes
[02:58:32.920 --> 02:58:36.840]  and then we've got poll joseph wantson coming up he's gonna go over the entire

[03:00:42.360 --> 03:00:49.080]  poise to overtake gdp chart of the day uh i mean this is where they wanted to
[03:00:49.080 --> 03:00:52.200]  get us this is the exact position they wanted to put us in
[03:00:52.200 --> 03:00:55.480]  morgan in alabama morgan you're on the air
[03:00:55.480 --> 03:00:59.000]  yeah i want to talk about the vp incident and
[03:00:59.000 --> 03:01:02.520]  my thing is since it happened they quit talking about
[03:01:02.520 --> 03:01:05.400]  the explosions that happened they haven't mentioned anything else
[03:01:05.400 --> 03:01:08.920]  about that it's been like a shadow over in the media
[03:01:08.920 --> 03:01:16.520]  but to me it just seems like the gulf coast is a great place for them to
[03:01:16.520 --> 03:01:21.960]  experiment or to start their dominance in this country of the takeover that you
[03:01:21.960 --> 03:01:26.600]  talk about a lot and um
[03:01:26.600 --> 03:01:30.520]  i think when it gets really hot down here there's some of the gas prices are
[03:01:30.520 --> 03:01:33.800]  going to be affected by this and i'm not saying that i know that
[03:01:33.800 --> 03:01:37.720]  that you know nobody knows for sure but i think that's part of the plan and it
[03:01:37.720 --> 03:01:40.680]  may be part of finally collapsing the dollar because
[03:01:40.680 --> 03:01:44.760]  you know when you stand in the past eight years when we've had the hurricane
[03:01:44.760 --> 03:01:47.960]  season it's really bad you have three four hurricanes come
[03:01:47.960 --> 03:01:52.600]  you know and hit the gulf coast you see these gas shortages happening you know
[03:01:52.600 --> 03:01:55.720]  people standing in line i think that it's going to be
[03:01:55.720 --> 03:02:01.240]  you know three times as worse at least by august it's going to be really no i
[03:02:01.240 --> 03:02:06.120]  agree with you it's it's again i mean it's a perfect storm of things happening
[03:02:06.120 --> 03:02:11.480]  and you add to that that bp now says uh that another company put an unauthorized
[03:02:11.480 --> 03:02:15.080]  piece of equipment on and they can't get answers and that's where the real
[03:02:15.080 --> 03:02:18.280]  investigation should be focused that could be the cover
[03:02:18.280 --> 03:02:22.360]  for the false flag event and watson uh steve watson
[03:02:22.360 --> 03:02:24.600]  paul watson and myself put an article together
[03:02:24.600 --> 03:02:28.520]  that boils all of this down it's up on prisonplanet.com and paul watson's
[03:02:28.520 --> 03:02:31.880]  going to walk through that and he may even take some calls probably
[03:02:31.880 --> 03:02:34.840]  will after the half-hour point after he's covered it
[03:02:34.840 --> 03:02:39.800]  specifically on the oil spill in fact i've tried to get to all the calls that
[03:02:39.800 --> 03:02:42.440]  were on the board but we're not going to be successful at that but i'll
[03:02:42.440 --> 03:02:46.040]  i'll have john uh up at the network go through
[03:02:46.040 --> 03:02:50.920]  uh donna chris uh mysterious and other callers
[03:02:50.920 --> 03:02:55.640]  uh once you just call yourself uh frankenberry or something i don't know
[03:02:55.640 --> 03:03:00.200]  mysterious tweedle d whatever i'm gonna stop being stupid
[03:03:00.200 --> 03:03:04.760]  kebler just just give yourself some type of fanciful name
[03:03:04.760 --> 03:03:07.960]  we'll say the caller from california is matt ryan how does that sound we'll say
[03:03:07.960 --> 03:03:11.560]  that secretly matt ryan calling it no no to be totally serious here
[03:03:11.560 --> 03:03:14.280]  um
[03:03:14.360 --> 03:03:17.960]  one eight hundred two five nine ninety two thirty one watson coming up at the
[03:03:17.960 --> 03:03:20.760]  bottom of the hour if he covers the news he'll take a few calls on the golf
[03:03:20.760 --> 03:03:25.000]  oil spill to get your take on that uh one eight hundred two five nine ninety
[03:03:25.000 --> 03:03:29.480]  two thirty one uh is the uh toll free number to join us
[03:03:29.480 --> 03:03:33.000]  here live on air uh there's another big report up on drudge
[03:03:33.000 --> 03:03:36.920]  seventy four percent oppose taxing internet news sites to help
[03:03:36.920 --> 03:03:40.520]  newspapers that's been proposed by the federal trade commission
[03:03:40.520 --> 03:03:43.640]  and there's a poll out there's an article by
[03:03:43.640 --> 03:03:49.400]  rasmussen polls dealing with this i'm a shame that twenty six percent
[03:03:49.400 --> 03:03:53.080]  of people that were polled would want to take money from people that have
[03:03:53.080 --> 03:03:57.000]  websites and give it to the fat cat corrupt lying
[03:03:57.000 --> 03:04:00.120]  newspapers but again you got twenty six percent
[03:04:00.120 --> 03:04:03.240]  i bet those are government workers and bureaucrat types
[03:04:03.240 --> 03:04:06.600]  uh that's about who works for the government now of course 95 percent of
[03:04:06.600 --> 03:04:09.000]  new job growth is in the government sector
[03:04:09.000 --> 03:04:12.040]  uh and i'm not saying we don't need some government but come on folks the whole
[03:04:12.040 --> 03:04:16.120]  country is collapsing we're not going to have any jobs if this doesn't stop
[03:04:16.120 --> 03:04:21.240]  but if you go to uh prisonplanet.com you can read the top story
[03:04:21.240 --> 03:04:25.000]  that's just gone up in the last hour evidence points to bp oil spill
[03:04:25.000 --> 03:04:29.160]  false flag this goes through all of it it is so important
[03:04:29.160 --> 03:04:34.040]  that this article get out to everyone and that this article run the blockade

[03:06:14.600 --> 03:06:18.200]  the respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and
[03:06:18.200 --> 03:06:21.400]  viruses the silver lungs generator infuses the
[03:06:21.400 --> 03:06:25.640]  respiratory system with your self-produced nano silver solutions
[03:06:25.640 --> 03:06:29.880]  and also delivers the silver nano particles instantly into the blood
[03:06:29.880 --> 03:06:32.760]  stream with continued legislation threatening the
[03:06:32.760 --> 03:06:36.600]  sale of nano silver products you can now produce pure
[03:06:36.600 --> 03:06:40.280]  and endless colloidal silver with the silver lungs generator
[03:06:40.280 --> 03:06:43.560]  very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided
[03:06:43.560 --> 03:06:46.360]  making production fast and simple go to

[03:06:59.800 --> 03:07:03.000]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[03:07:03.000 --> 03:07:07.080]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[03:07:07.080 --> 03:07:11.000]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants
[03:07:11.000 --> 03:07:14.360]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[03:07:14.360 --> 03:07:18.600]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[03:07:18.600 --> 03:07:22.200]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country
[03:07:22.200 --> 03:07:26.680]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[03:07:26.680 --> 03:07:30.520]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[03:07:30.520 --> 03:07:33.720]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose
[03:07:33.720 --> 03:07:37.640]  their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator
[03:07:37.640 --> 03:07:41.480]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in
[03:07:41.480 --> 03:07:44.120]  the solar power generators offered by solutions from science
[03:07:44.120 --> 03:07:49.720]  one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com
[03:07:49.720 --> 03:07:53.720]  that's mysolarbackup.com remember the government doesn't own the sun

[03:08:02.440 --> 03:08:06.520]  from his central texas command center deep behind enemy lines
[03:08:06.520 --> 03:08:10.280]  the information war continues it's alex jones
[03:08:10.280 --> 03:08:17.080]  and the gcn radio network
[03:08:17.080 --> 03:08:21.480]  it's tuesday june 8th 2010 this is final hour
[03:08:21.480 --> 03:08:25.320]  at the alex jones show my name is paul joseph watson
[03:08:25.320 --> 03:08:29.000]  i'm the editor and writer at prismplanet.com
[03:08:29.000 --> 03:08:32.120]  and i'll be sitting in for the last 60 minutes
[03:08:32.120 --> 03:08:36.200]  um on today's broadcast as i did yesterday
[03:08:36.200 --> 03:08:40.120]  um of course we have kurt nimmer over at infowars.com and
[03:08:40.120 --> 03:08:46.120]  steve watson who is the writer and editor at infowars.net as well as
[03:08:46.120 --> 03:08:52.120]  prismplanet.com now alex has been discussing the bp oil spill
[03:08:52.120 --> 03:08:56.280]  um throughout the length of the broadcast and within the last
[03:08:56.280 --> 03:08:59.960]  hour we've just published a report on this
[03:08:59.960 --> 03:09:06.360]  at prismplanet.com and um there are a number of disturbing
[03:09:06.360 --> 03:09:09.960]  suspicious and revealing pieces of evidence
[03:09:09.960 --> 03:09:14.040]  that as alex talks about in the past three hours
[03:09:14.040 --> 03:09:17.400]  strongly indicate that not only was there for knowledge
[03:09:17.400 --> 03:09:24.840]  of the explosion um but the so-called accident may indeed have been deliberate
[03:09:24.840 --> 03:09:27.720]  now what we've seen over the past several days is
[03:09:27.720 --> 03:09:33.000]  and especially today this um fake grandstanding by obama
[03:09:33.000 --> 03:09:37.400]  he's going to quote kick ass and deal with the
[03:09:37.400 --> 03:09:42.680]  culprits of whoever was behind and whoever was responsible for the oil spill
[03:09:42.680 --> 03:09:48.360]  and basically i'm just not buying it i mean obama was anointed at the 2008
[03:09:48.360 --> 03:09:51.080]  builderberg meeting in shantilly virginia
[03:09:51.080 --> 03:09:54.680]  where he met there with um hillary clinton in this big
[03:09:54.680 --> 03:09:58.600]  secret meeting that was built up by the media but never actually
[03:09:58.600 --> 03:10:03.000]  reported on the fact that it was at builderberg
[03:10:03.000 --> 03:10:09.320]  now bp basically is builderberg every single person of influence within
[03:10:09.320 --> 03:10:14.600]  british petroleum is a key builderberg member and regular attendee
[03:10:14.600 --> 03:10:20.040]  people like john brown the former um ceo people like the chairman henricks
[03:10:20.040 --> 03:10:24.920]  vanberg and of course um the current chief executive of bp
[03:10:24.920 --> 03:10:31.400]  tony hayward who was recently pretty active in um getting rid of his shares
[03:10:31.400 --> 03:10:35.240]  in bp right before the oil spill that's one of the pieces of evidence we cover
[03:10:35.240 --> 03:10:40.120]  in the article and of course um former bp chairman
[03:10:40.120 --> 03:10:45.080]  peter southerland who is now the chairman of goldman sacks who also attended
[03:10:45.080 --> 03:10:49.400]  the builderberg meeting in spain um over this past weekend
[03:10:49.400 --> 03:10:54.200]  so this um sideshow this punch and judy show that
[03:10:54.200 --> 03:10:59.160]  obama is now going after bp and after the culprits of the oil spill
[03:10:59.160 --> 03:11:04.520]  i'm just not buying it because i mean the first thing that obama did after
[03:11:04.520 --> 03:11:09.320]  this happened and after it became pretty apparent that it was a big disaster
[03:11:09.320 --> 03:11:13.400]  and that it was ruining businesses um and livelihoods
[03:11:13.400 --> 03:11:17.800]  um all around the gulf coast the first thing he did was go on holiday
[03:11:17.800 --> 03:11:22.040]  in fact he's been on two vacations since it happened
[03:11:22.040 --> 03:11:25.960]  two weeks ago he was playing basketball i mean come on
[03:11:25.960 --> 03:11:31.160]  there's no way obama's going after bp they're both builderberg minions they're
[03:11:31.160 --> 03:11:35.720]  on the same team and indeed it seems like obama's taking
[03:11:35.720 --> 03:11:38.600]  one for the team with his political career because
[03:11:38.600 --> 03:11:43.240]  um there's certainly no way he's going to go after bp because they're both
[03:11:43.240 --> 03:11:49.720]  together with the builderberg group um in on this new world order
[03:11:49.720 --> 03:11:53.960]  um and ultimately the bigger this crisis gets
[03:11:53.960 --> 03:11:59.560]  and the more the media hypes it up um the bigger the opportunity to exploit it
[03:11:59.560 --> 03:12:02.840]  which is you know exactly what people like rom and manuel
[03:12:02.840 --> 03:12:07.000]  obama's top advisor and hillary clinton both wrote
[03:12:07.000 --> 03:12:11.720]  routinely call for is for crisis is to be exploited
[03:12:11.720 --> 03:12:15.720]  um to pursue the agenda of world government which is exactly what's
[03:12:15.720 --> 03:12:21.320]  happening with this bp disaster and it's not just the fact that
[03:12:21.320 --> 03:12:25.960]  halliburton as alex mentioned uh in the last segment purchased this company
[03:12:25.960 --> 03:12:31.240]  uh to deal with specifically this company deals with oil spill cleanups
[03:12:31.240 --> 03:12:35.400]  and halliburton purchased it right before the explosion happened
[03:12:35.400 --> 03:12:40.040]  it's not just the fact that goldman sacks which of course is headed up now
[03:12:40.040 --> 03:12:46.680]  by peter southerland build burger and former bp ceo
[03:12:46.680 --> 03:12:51.160]  goldman sacks dumped 44 percent of its shares in
[03:12:51.160 --> 03:12:55.080]  bp british petroleum during the first quarter of this year
[03:12:55.080 --> 03:12:59.800]  and it's not just the fact that's only hayward the current bp ceo
[03:12:59.800 --> 03:13:05.960]  sold 1.4 million pounds of his shares in bp in the weeks before the
[03:13:05.960 --> 03:13:09.960]  disaster i mean all that suggests that there was
[03:13:09.960 --> 03:13:14.600]  foreknowledge indeed but the most alarming smoking gun
[03:13:14.600 --> 03:13:19.640]  is the fact that bp's own investigative report into the
[03:13:19.640 --> 03:13:24.680]  oil spill on page 37 and we've got this linked up in the article on
[03:13:24.680 --> 03:13:29.880]  prismplanet.com quite clearly states that quote
[03:13:29.880 --> 03:13:35.560]  undocumented modifications were made to the hydraulic system
[03:13:35.560 --> 03:13:39.480]  um that is used to seal the well in the event of an emergency
[03:13:39.480 --> 03:13:44.520]  before the explosion took place so bp is now claiming that
[03:13:44.520 --> 03:13:48.200]  they don't know who did this when it happened it's completely undocumented
[03:13:48.200 --> 03:13:51.960]  but the modifications were made to the very
[03:13:51.960 --> 03:13:57.480]  piece of equipment that is supposed to stop this kind of disaster from taking
[03:13:57.480 --> 03:14:01.160]  place now why that's not all over the news
[03:14:01.160 --> 03:14:06.040]  i have no idea because it's right there in page 37 of bp's
[03:14:06.040 --> 03:14:12.440]  own investigative report into the disaster so not only do we have the
[03:14:12.440 --> 03:14:18.200]  suspicious stock and share sales right before the event
[03:14:18.200 --> 03:14:22.360]  halibut and purchasing this oil spill cleanup company
[03:14:22.360 --> 03:14:28.760]  right before the event but we have the fact that bp's own report says that
[03:14:28.760 --> 03:14:32.760]  unknown modifications occurred with the very equipment that's supposed to
[03:14:32.760 --> 03:14:38.200]  prevent this kind of disaster before the explosion took place
[03:14:38.200 --> 03:14:44.120]  now obviously the um question to ask is if this was
[03:14:44.120 --> 03:14:48.200]  deliberate or if anybody had foreknowledge of it
[03:14:48.200 --> 03:14:52.200]  and knew that it was about to take place in order to benefit
[03:14:52.200 --> 03:14:56.760]  um qui bono who benefits
[03:14:56.760 --> 03:15:00.680]  i mean experts are now saying that this could drag on for years and years and
[03:15:00.680 --> 03:15:04.920]  years well we know that obama and the globalists
[03:15:04.920 --> 03:15:08.520]  who control him who pull his strings who anointed him
[03:15:08.520 --> 03:15:13.480]  at the 2008 bill de burg meeting which was also attended by members of
[03:15:13.480 --> 03:15:18.840]  british petroleum they want a carbon tax
[03:15:18.840 --> 03:15:23.000]  they want a gas tax they want a consumption tax
[03:15:23.000 --> 03:15:28.440]  so basically means the same thing but they're not going to get it
[03:15:28.440 --> 03:15:32.760]  with the situation that we've got in place at the moment
[03:15:32.760 --> 03:15:36.440]  certainly what would help them to get it ran through
[03:15:36.440 --> 03:15:42.120]  is if the government federal government of the united states nationalizes the
[03:15:42.120 --> 03:15:45.880]  oil companies which we know is a stated goal of the
[03:15:45.880 --> 03:15:50.920]  democrats and so we've got with the failure of
[03:15:50.920 --> 03:15:57.720]  Copenhagen and with the exposure of the phony global warming movement
[03:15:57.720 --> 03:16:03.400]  after climate gate the carbon tax has basically hit a dead end
[03:16:03.400 --> 03:16:07.480]  but now we've got this major environmental disaster
[03:16:07.480 --> 03:16:11.480]  um obama appears to have been asleep at the wheel
[03:16:11.480 --> 03:16:17.640]  in the initial stages of it but now he's promising to quote kick ass
[03:16:17.640 --> 03:16:22.120]  and identify the culprits who were responsible for the mistakes that led
[03:16:22.120 --> 03:16:27.240]  to the quote accident but the problem is the culprits
[03:16:27.240 --> 03:16:32.680]  are his bill de burg friends who visit the same meeting each year and get the
[03:16:32.680 --> 03:16:36.920]  same instructions that he does so there's no way in the world obama
[03:16:36.920 --> 03:16:41.000]  has any interest in prosecuting or finding the
[03:16:41.000 --> 03:16:49.880]  plutocrat the culprits behind the disaster so this is all intended to
[03:16:49.880 --> 03:16:55.480]  provide justification for the agenda to nationalize oil companies which the
[03:16:55.480 --> 03:17:00.280]  democrats have publicly pursued and it will open the door
[03:17:00.280 --> 03:17:03.800]  for a carbon tax and the longer it drags on
[03:17:03.800 --> 03:17:09.240]  the more intense the problem seems to be with non-stop coverage from the media
[03:17:09.240 --> 03:17:14.120]  who in the initial stages of this i mean it was a big story
[03:17:14.120 --> 03:17:19.240]  but it wasn't up there as the top story every day with endless coverage
[03:17:19.240 --> 03:17:22.920]  i mean every time i turn on cnn or fox news in the last
[03:17:22.920 --> 03:17:27.240]  two weeks top story has always been this bp oil spill
[03:17:27.240 --> 03:17:34.760]  which is strange for a story that started what now more than six weeks ago
[03:17:34.760 --> 03:17:38.760]  there's a news cycle and even if this is a big problem
[03:17:38.760 --> 03:17:42.440]  six weeks after it occurred it doesn't normally stay at the top of the news
[03:17:42.440 --> 03:17:46.280]  cycle but it's being pushed back up there because
[03:17:46.280 --> 03:17:52.520]  i think we're going to see very soon measures proposed
[03:17:52.520 --> 03:17:57.080]  to at least part nationalize the oil companies
[03:17:57.080 --> 03:18:01.160]  or at least use this exploit this crisis
[03:18:01.160 --> 03:18:08.200]  to further the so-called green economy and the move towards
[03:18:08.200 --> 03:18:14.200]  a carbon tax a consumption tax a gas tax that will of course completely
[03:18:14.200 --> 03:18:17.960]  eviscerate whatever disposable income the middle
[03:18:17.960 --> 03:18:23.560]  class has left after you know the crippling fascist
[03:18:23.560 --> 03:18:28.040]  austerity measures that are now being proposed
[03:18:28.040 --> 03:18:35.480]  not only in europe but also in america so the articles up there at prison
[03:18:35.480 --> 03:18:40.040]  planet dot com uh... we run through all the evidence
[03:18:40.040 --> 03:18:43.960]  the suspicion the indications that not only
[03:18:43.960 --> 03:18:47.320]  was there for knowledge i don't think anyone can deny that there was some kind
[03:18:47.320 --> 03:18:50.440]  of for knowledge of this mirrors almost entirely
[03:18:50.440 --> 03:18:54.680]  the aggressive selling of airline stocks before nine eleven
[03:18:54.680 --> 03:18:58.600]  watch and i don't mean to interrupt you but uh... i'm i'm i'm out there watching
[03:18:58.600 --> 03:19:03.080]  uh... and and and listening as you fill in on the syndicated transmission
[03:19:03.080 --> 03:19:07.320]  and i was just reminded of haiti hundreds of thousands dead it was in the
[03:19:07.320 --> 03:19:10.680]  news for three weeks uh... that just happened a few months ago it's now
[03:19:10.680 --> 03:19:15.080]  completely off the table uh... and shan penn and others are running
[03:19:15.080 --> 03:19:18.360]  around trying to get celebrities to go public and try to get them help
[03:19:18.360 --> 03:19:21.480]  uh... because tens of thousands of more are dying right now
[03:19:21.480 --> 03:19:25.240]  it is completely collapsed but but that just goes to your point
[03:19:25.240 --> 03:19:29.000]  of that is a lot bigger than this oil spill
[03:19:29.000 --> 03:19:32.280]  uh... you know not to belittle the other size of this and the importance of it
[03:19:32.280 --> 03:19:36.200]  so clearly they are artificially hyping it to the top
[03:19:36.200 --> 03:19:39.240]  and i think overall just as a political diversion
[03:19:39.240 --> 03:19:41.880]  from the global political meltdown that's happening but
[03:19:41.880 --> 03:19:44.680]  but but finish up when you come back with your points i just wanted to

[03:24:07.240 --> 03:24:14.040]  the gcm radio network
[03:24:14.040 --> 03:24:19.320]  it's the alex jones show i'm filling in for alex it's paul joseph watson alex
[03:24:19.320 --> 03:24:22.200]  is working on his upcoming documentary film
[03:24:22.200 --> 03:24:26.920]  and we're talking about the bp oil spill uh we'll be taking some of your calls
[03:24:26.920 --> 03:24:31.080]  in the next segment now we were talking about this
[03:24:31.080 --> 03:24:35.880]  grandstanding that's going on with obama preparing to quote kick ass
[03:24:35.880 --> 03:24:39.640]  and root out the culprits that were behind
[03:24:39.640 --> 03:24:44.120]  making the quote mistakes that led to the oil spill
[03:24:44.120 --> 03:24:50.600]  now bbc is reporting um us tests confirm big underwater oil plumes
[03:24:50.600 --> 03:24:55.320]  tests have shown that underwater oil plumes are traveling dozens of miles
[03:24:55.320 --> 03:24:59.560]  from a leaking well in the gulf of mexico the u.s government says
[03:24:59.560 --> 03:25:05.000]  um and it makes reference to this interview with mbc news that obama did
[03:25:05.000 --> 03:25:11.560]  in which he said he would have fired uh british petroleum ceo tony hayward
[03:25:11.560 --> 03:25:15.240]  um over the remarks he's made about the crisis
[03:25:15.240 --> 03:25:19.000]  which as i said before the break is a complete misnomer
[03:25:19.000 --> 03:25:26.280]  this idea that obama is cracking down on bp is completely a fraud it's a side
[03:25:26.280 --> 03:25:31.000]  show because tony hayward peter southerland and the other
[03:25:31.000 --> 03:25:36.440]  people involved at the top with bp are all top bill the burger tendies
[03:25:36.440 --> 03:25:41.160]  as was obama in 2008 there's no fight between these people it's
[03:25:41.160 --> 03:25:47.080]  ridiculous to even suggest it which is why um for the first three or
[03:25:47.080 --> 03:25:50.280]  four weeks of the crisis obama was too busy
[03:25:50.280 --> 03:25:53.960]  taking uh two vacations and playing basketball
[03:25:53.960 --> 03:25:57.720]  um to even care about what was going on i mean
[03:25:57.720 --> 03:26:03.160]  you know nero fiddle while rome burned that's exactly what obama did
[03:26:03.160 --> 03:26:08.200]  um because they only benefit from this crisis becoming bigger and bigger
[03:26:08.200 --> 03:26:11.720]  because it jives directly with their agenda for
[03:26:11.720 --> 03:26:15.880]  a carbon tax a consumption tax a gas tax
[03:26:15.880 --> 03:26:20.600]  um which will be made all the more easier if they're able to nationalize the
[03:26:20.600 --> 03:26:24.840]  oil companies which is what the democrats and obama
[03:26:24.840 --> 03:26:29.720]  have stated is their ultimate agenda so we're going to take calls on that after
[03:26:29.720 --> 03:26:33.400]  the break and get your take on uh what's
[03:26:33.400 --> 03:26:36.600]  going on with the bp oil spill as i mentioned
[03:26:36.600 --> 03:26:41.880]  prismplanet.com uh we in the last hour and a half we posted a big article on
[03:26:41.880 --> 03:26:44.520]  this listing all the evidence suggesting that
[03:26:44.520 --> 03:26:47.800]  not only was there for knowledge uh with all these
[03:26:47.800 --> 03:26:52.680]  top CEOs dumping their stocks goldman sacks dumping their stocks
[03:26:52.680 --> 03:26:56.040]  right before the crisis occurred but there's
[03:26:56.040 --> 03:27:00.360]  actually evidence of deliberate tampering with the very systems that
[03:27:00.360 --> 03:27:04.760]  are supposed to prevent this kind of disaster in bp's own official
[03:27:04.760 --> 03:27:10.280]  investigative report on page 37 it says that the hydraulic systems um
[03:27:10.280 --> 03:27:14.600]  was undocumented there were undocumented
[03:27:14.600 --> 03:27:19.720]  alterations with the hydraulic systems before the explosion
[03:27:19.720 --> 03:27:22.760]  also in the next segment we're going to get into
[03:27:22.760 --> 03:27:26.600]  just briefly because we're going to take calls mainly but how
[03:27:26.600 --> 03:27:32.280]  top historians and analysts are now forecasting and this ties into the um
[03:27:32.280 --> 03:27:38.440]  carbon tax post industrial revolution agenda that the globalists are pushing
[03:27:38.440 --> 03:27:42.680]  how top analysts are forecasting an age of rage
[03:27:42.680 --> 03:27:48.200]  and how the austerity measures that you've seen in Greece you've seen the
[03:27:48.200 --> 03:27:51.960]  reaction to them in Greece the media don't really tell you what those
[03:27:51.960 --> 03:27:56.840]  austerity measures are um have provoked chaos violence and even
[03:27:56.840 --> 03:28:01.240]  deaths now those scenes are coming to the united
[03:28:01.240 --> 03:28:05.720]  states they're coming to other countries in europe
[03:28:05.720 --> 03:28:09.560]  but what exactly are these austerity measures that the greeks are so
[03:28:09.560 --> 03:28:13.960]  up in arms about we're going to get into that and we're going to
[03:28:13.960 --> 03:28:18.840]  break down how if you thought if you thought the scenes that we saw
[03:28:18.840 --> 03:28:22.760]  unfolding greeks were bad wait until what's going to happen
[03:28:22.760 --> 03:28:26.840]  not only in the uk but later on down the line in america
[03:28:26.840 --> 03:28:31.640]  um when the same kind of fascist austerity measures
[03:28:31.640 --> 03:28:34.840]  which basically amounts to nothing more than a
[03:28:34.840 --> 03:28:39.160]  massive lowering of living standards in line with the quote
[03:28:39.160 --> 03:28:44.360]  post industrial revolution that the globalists want to force upon
[03:28:44.360 --> 03:28:48.520]  the population of the west you're going to see
[03:28:48.520 --> 03:28:53.560]  really how in jeopardy your pensions your savings
[03:28:53.560 --> 03:28:57.400]  people are welfare you're going to see how much in jeopardy
[03:28:57.400 --> 03:29:01.320]  all these things are um with the austerity measures that
[03:29:01.320 --> 03:29:08.360]  governments are planning to impose um within the next year or two in europe
[03:29:08.360 --> 03:29:11.880]  and certainly america's going to follow not for a while
[03:29:11.880 --> 03:29:16.680]  obviously they're saying um seven to ten years america will be on a par with
[03:29:16.680 --> 03:29:20.200]  greece i think it's going to come into play before that but
[03:29:20.200 --> 03:29:23.960]  certainly um europe will be the first to suffer
[03:29:23.960 --> 03:29:28.200]  these consequences of this fiscal fascism from the financial
[03:29:28.200 --> 03:29:31.080]  terrorist that caused the crisis in the first place
[03:29:31.080 --> 03:29:35.560]  but after the break we're going to take your calls on this and the BP oil spill

[03:33:38.200 --> 03:33:41.960]  documentary film now we're talking about a bp
[03:33:41.960 --> 03:33:46.840]  oil spill and how the evidence now suggests that not only was there for
[03:33:46.840 --> 03:33:51.800]  knowledge of the event but that they may even have been tampering
[03:33:51.800 --> 03:33:56.360]  with the equipment that caused the oil spill the explosion itself
[03:33:56.360 --> 03:34:00.920]  we're also going to get into the wider aspects of this post industrial
[03:34:00.920 --> 03:34:06.200]  revolution that the globalists are trying to impose on the free people
[03:34:06.200 --> 03:34:10.600]  specifically in the western world but now we're going to take some meal calls
[03:34:10.600 --> 03:34:14.600]  um i want to talk about the bp oil spill i want to talk about
[03:34:14.600 --> 03:34:18.200]  bill deberg the austerity fascism that's coming
[03:34:18.200 --> 03:34:24.840]  and our first caller is donna in new hampshire donna you are on the air
[03:34:24.840 --> 03:34:28.920]  hi paul you're doing a wonderful job um i just wanted to
[03:34:28.920 --> 03:34:32.440]  uh kind of touch base with first ball my husband is down in the gulf he's been
[03:34:32.440 --> 03:34:35.880]  down there ever since uh all of this started uprising
[03:34:35.880 --> 03:34:40.680]  and uh he has been at ground zero and he said the oil
[03:34:40.680 --> 03:34:44.120]  when you go five miles west or five miles east you didn't see
[03:34:44.120 --> 03:34:48.760]  anything all the way up to the shore and uh you know i really think
[03:34:48.760 --> 03:34:51.320]  this has been my take on it from the very beginning
[03:34:51.320 --> 03:34:55.720]  that bp excuse me bp is falling on their sword
[03:34:55.720 --> 03:34:58.440]  they're falling on their sword for the new world order
[03:34:58.440 --> 03:35:03.240]  to implement uh the carbon taxes and get all this because
[03:35:03.240 --> 03:35:09.240]  uh uh obama came in and said that there's going to be no more drilling
[03:35:09.240 --> 03:35:12.360]  which would put my husband out of business along with
[03:35:12.360 --> 03:35:15.400]  the fact that there is no fishing uh being done
[03:35:15.400 --> 03:35:19.400]  that's that's ruining it up a billion dollar industry right there
[03:35:19.400 --> 03:35:25.560]  what better way to shut down everything and collapse our economy but to come in
[03:35:25.560 --> 03:35:29.560]  and make this look bigger than it is the media has been throwing this
[03:35:29.560 --> 03:35:35.160]  completely out uh you know out of whack and the fact that bp wouldn't even let
[03:35:35.160 --> 03:35:39.480]  uh you know most of mainstream media even in and around the area
[03:35:39.480 --> 03:35:44.600]  um you know is is telling to me yeah well i mean
[03:35:44.600 --> 03:35:48.440]  as soon as this happened you had people like mark levin
[03:35:48.440 --> 03:35:52.200]  questioning why obama was sending swat teams there
[03:35:52.200 --> 03:35:57.560]  and saying that basically you know as you said this represents completely
[03:35:57.560 --> 03:36:00.920]  the wrong response to how this should be handled
[03:36:00.920 --> 03:36:05.160]  um you mentioned the fishing that's being devastated and it has
[03:36:05.160 --> 03:36:09.160]  and we know that um the government the federal government
[03:36:09.160 --> 03:36:13.720]  the globalists do indeed have this agenda to shut down the oil industry
[03:36:13.720 --> 03:36:17.880]  that's what they talk about that's what buroso the EU commission head talks
[03:36:17.880 --> 03:36:21.720]  about on a regular basis that's what the post industrial revolution is
[03:36:21.720 --> 03:36:26.520]  it's about shutting down industry and turning our economy into this green
[03:36:26.520 --> 03:36:30.840]  economy which is a complete disaster because it costs
[03:36:30.840 --> 03:36:36.360]  um 2.2 jobs for every job created so they want to lower living standards they
[03:36:36.360 --> 03:36:40.360]  want more in unemployment and letting this crisis
[03:36:40.360 --> 03:36:44.120]  rumble on as it has done is the perfect entree
[03:36:44.120 --> 03:36:47.480]  um to achieving that and i thank you for your call
[03:36:47.480 --> 03:36:52.760]  um we're going to move on now to bill in kinetica bill you're on the air
[03:36:52.760 --> 03:36:56.760]  how you doing paul all right bill how are you real good real good
[03:36:56.760 --> 03:37:01.000]  hey um just wanted to uh point out that uh today
[03:37:01.000 --> 03:37:07.240]  on msnbc obama is sitting there saying that he's gonna fire
[03:37:07.240 --> 03:37:11.160]  the president of british petroleum for his
[03:37:11.160 --> 03:37:14.920]  moughing up the job and i find it very funny because
[03:37:14.920 --> 03:37:18.680]  didn't the u.s government say that they were in charge
[03:37:18.680 --> 03:37:25.800]  of the job and if that's true then isn't obama firing himself
[03:37:25.800 --> 03:37:29.320]  well that's right as i said in the last segment
[03:37:29.320 --> 03:37:33.160]  obama and bp are on arm in arm they're hand in hand
[03:37:33.160 --> 03:37:38.440]  they're both luminaries of the builder group now the idea of um
[03:37:38.440 --> 03:37:44.120]  obama being able to fire um somebody in a private corporation
[03:37:44.120 --> 03:37:50.040]  is of course completely fascist um they try to have that included in the top
[03:37:50.040 --> 03:37:53.080]  package in fact i think they did have language which
[03:37:53.080 --> 03:37:57.240]  indicated that um obama would be allowed to fire
[03:37:57.240 --> 03:38:00.680]  um CEOs of corporations which of course
[03:38:00.680 --> 03:38:04.280]  um is completely undemocratic it's completely
[03:38:04.280 --> 03:38:08.680]  anti-business and it's not something that's ever happened before in a free
[03:38:08.680 --> 03:38:12.120]  america um but yeah it's a it's a punch and
[03:38:12.120 --> 03:38:15.320]  duty sideshow obama's not going to go after bp
[03:38:15.320 --> 03:38:19.960]  um he's not going to kick any ass he's on the same team as them and
[03:38:19.960 --> 03:38:24.520]  both obama politically and bp are taking one for the team and they're
[03:38:24.520 --> 03:38:31.560]  allowing this to get worse and worse um so they can later exploit the crisis
[03:38:31.560 --> 03:38:35.880]  um you know pertaining to uh chris matthew's
[03:38:35.880 --> 03:38:40.200]  show coming up on the 16th there i thought that everybody should use this
[03:38:40.200 --> 03:38:44.920]  as an opportunity okay to to make lemonade out of lemons so if chris
[03:38:44.920 --> 03:38:49.080]  matthew is going to be handing out lemons uh for the tea party and
[03:38:49.080 --> 03:38:53.400]  specifically to alex jones you know i really think that we ought to have a
[03:38:53.400 --> 03:38:58.040]  viewing party across the united states of all the tea
[03:38:58.040 --> 03:39:01.800]  party years and so on so forth to go ahead and have a good laugh because you
[03:39:01.800 --> 03:39:04.520]  know we know that these guys are trying to expose
[03:39:04.520 --> 03:39:09.960]  people that are exposing them uh to you know so what's really going on so
[03:39:09.960 --> 03:39:14.840]  you know i thought that that would be another great thing to probably do
[03:39:14.840 --> 03:39:18.920]  that's a good idea i mean the thing the thing about chris matthew's and this
[03:39:18.920 --> 03:39:23.400]  um you know rise of the right is basically going to be a smear attack on
[03:39:23.400 --> 03:39:27.400]  alex jones and uh everybody who is trying to expose this
[03:39:27.400 --> 03:39:30.280]  globalist takeover and it's coming up i believe
[03:39:30.280 --> 03:39:33.640]  um in the next few days or early next week
[03:39:33.640 --> 03:39:36.600]  i mean chris matthew says that his hero is sol
[03:39:36.600 --> 03:39:42.040]  olinsky you know the big comic the rise of the right i mean if
[03:39:42.040 --> 03:39:46.040]  if your hero is sol olinsky then everybody
[03:39:46.040 --> 03:39:49.480]  on the political spectrum is going to be to the right of you
[03:39:49.480 --> 03:39:53.880]  it's ridiculous alex jones spent eight years
[03:39:53.880 --> 03:39:59.800]  um bashing bosch and he's this right wing extremist i mean they're hoping
[03:39:59.800 --> 03:40:03.880]  that people have quite short memories there uh and of course
[03:40:03.880 --> 03:40:08.680]  of this it's trying to portray as a radicals it ties in with a mayac report
[03:40:08.680 --> 03:40:11.640]  trying to smear as all this domestic terrorists when
[03:40:11.640 --> 03:40:16.440]  we've been nothing but peaceful um they did the same thing with the 911 truth
[03:40:16.440 --> 03:40:21.960]  movement trying to say they were dangerous completely failed again so
[03:40:21.960 --> 03:40:25.400]  it's going to be interesting what kind of tactic they uh
[03:40:25.400 --> 03:40:29.160]  what kind of angle they approach this at but it's probably going to be the same
[03:40:29.160 --> 03:40:35.720]  tired old cliches about how where this frontier of dangerous extremism
[03:40:35.720 --> 03:40:39.160]  when all we're doing is telling the truth and trying to wake up people to what's
[03:40:39.160 --> 03:40:41.880]  happening i thank you for your call and now we're
[03:40:41.880 --> 03:40:47.240]  going to go to uh henry in michigan henry you are on the air
[03:40:47.240 --> 03:40:51.640]  hey what are you doing all right henry what's on your mind
[03:40:51.640 --> 03:40:55.880]  well hey i'll tell you uh i don't know if anybody else has seen this
[03:40:55.880 --> 03:40:59.720]  on the 21st a day after this explosion they had
[03:40:59.720 --> 03:41:08.120]  uh a survivalist that uh said that prior to the explosion the bp
[03:41:08.120 --> 03:41:15.320]  project manager i'm assuming uh had a a big meeting with all the
[03:41:15.320 --> 03:41:20.200]  bp uh higher echelons of the the contractor
[03:41:20.200 --> 03:41:26.360]  that that built the rig and uh they knew perfectly well
[03:41:26.360 --> 03:41:31.400]  uh beforehand that the the check valve deal down below
[03:41:31.400 --> 03:41:36.200]  was faulty and uh the seals were broken and everything else and this kid came
[03:41:36.200 --> 03:41:41.560]  out on tv and and uh spread the beans well
[03:41:41.560 --> 03:41:45.160]  something i haven't worked with one thing about
[03:41:45.160 --> 03:41:50.040]  never have seen this guy again on tv the survivalist but he spilled his guts
[03:41:50.040 --> 03:41:54.760]  out saying that bp was perfectly aware of the whole situation
[03:41:54.760 --> 03:42:00.600]  and uh yeah i'm going to go ahead and something else has really pulled with me
[03:42:00.600 --> 03:42:05.080]  about this whole situation as you know i've been a pipefeder industrial pipefeder
[03:42:05.080 --> 03:42:09.960]  for 42 years and i'm watching these stupid clowns you know trying to cut
[03:42:09.960 --> 03:42:13.160]  this pipe down there i'm granted it is
[03:42:13.160 --> 03:42:18.440]  quite a test down but you know like to cap that well
[03:42:18.440 --> 03:42:23.240]  would be a simple thing i mean you stick in a a blow-up plug
[03:42:23.240 --> 03:42:27.960]  uh you you shoot it full of gas and you fill it full of hydrodromic cement
[03:42:27.960 --> 03:42:31.960]  and uh and it's capped and and i feel that the
[03:42:31.960 --> 03:42:38.440]  the reason that bp is negligent in in capping this thing is that once it's
[03:42:38.440 --> 03:42:43.880]  capped the well is dead and it's all it all boils down to the
[03:42:43.880 --> 03:42:47.000]  greed and money thing and the plus they're trying to
[03:42:47.000 --> 03:42:51.240]  for some reason it seems to me they're trying to kill the gulf
[03:42:51.240 --> 03:42:57.000]  and to raise the gas prices but to bring in their um
[03:42:57.000 --> 03:43:04.360]  their new world order regime and uh just you know make hell on earth here for us
[03:43:04.360 --> 03:43:12.680]  um yeah well i mean uh the point you raise that bp is probably trying to
[03:43:12.680 --> 03:43:16.280]  not stop the leak because it would shut down the well entirely that's
[03:43:16.280 --> 03:43:20.120]  that's a charge that's been that's come up quite often that their agenda is to
[03:43:20.120 --> 03:43:24.680]  restart the well um so if if they did shut it down
[03:43:24.680 --> 03:43:27.560]  entirely i mean there's been talk of nuking it that would
[03:43:27.560 --> 03:43:31.640]  obviously terminate it entirely then they would lose uh a lot of
[03:43:31.640 --> 03:43:36.040]  money but i mean as you also talked about earlier
[03:43:36.040 --> 03:43:40.680]  um the the actual device the hydraulic control system that's
[03:43:40.680 --> 03:43:43.640]  supposed to prevent this kind of disaster from happening
[03:43:43.640 --> 03:43:48.920]  in bp's own investigative report and i suggest uh you read it we link to it in
[03:43:48.920 --> 03:43:51.480]  the article that we've posted on prism planet very
[03:43:51.480 --> 03:43:54.360]  interesting on page 37 it says that they
[03:43:54.360 --> 03:43:59.240]  quote identified undocumented modifications to the hydraulic control
[03:43:59.240 --> 03:44:02.120]  system the extent of these modifications is
[03:44:02.120 --> 03:44:05.320]  unknown at this time so they knew that something
[03:44:05.320 --> 03:44:09.720]  um had been tampered with before it happened and then you also you have the
[03:44:09.720 --> 03:44:14.840]  foreknowledge of the top bp executives selling all the stocks and shares so
[03:44:14.840 --> 03:44:19.320]  very suspicious and indicates that a lot more is going on than what we're being
[03:44:19.320 --> 03:44:22.520]  told and there's definitely a cover-up um
[03:44:22.520 --> 03:44:25.960]  but we're going to go to next caller thanks for your call henry uh we're
[03:44:25.960 --> 03:44:30.840]  going to stewart in massachusetts stewart you are on the air
[03:44:30.840 --> 03:44:34.680]  hey cheers Watson hi stewart um
[03:44:35.960 --> 03:44:39.400]  what's on your mind today stewart okay this is what i want to bring up
[03:44:39.400 --> 03:44:44.520]  but i'm not i'm not an expert on this but me and my friends were talking
[03:44:44.520 --> 03:44:47.720]  and my friend Henry who's pretty smart brought this up
[03:44:47.720 --> 03:44:52.040]  what's going to happen now when there's a hurricane down there because there is
[03:44:52.040 --> 03:44:57.000]  pretty much every year and on top of that what are the odds
[03:44:57.000 --> 03:45:00.440]  of lightning igniting and ended up with some real
[03:45:00.440 --> 03:45:04.360]  biblical type weather like fire raining from the sky
[03:45:04.360 --> 03:45:08.040]  you know what i'm saying like what happens if you get the perfect storm down
[03:45:08.040 --> 03:45:11.000]  there i mean i know a hurricane is probably going to disperse it all over
[03:45:11.000 --> 03:45:14.440]  the south i mean it's probably going to get everywhere but what happens
[03:45:14.440 --> 03:45:18.040]  is it possible for lightning to ignite that
[03:45:18.040 --> 03:45:22.360]  while it's in the atmosphere and ending up with just some real horrific
[03:45:22.360 --> 03:45:26.680]  you know like basically like i said fire raining down from the sky
[03:45:26.680 --> 03:45:30.520]  i don't know if you know much about that either but i want to put that out there
[03:45:30.520 --> 03:45:34.360]  because you know he raised that point and i was like whoa
[03:45:34.360 --> 03:45:37.960]  you know what i mean so if somebody who does know about that kind of stuff
[03:45:37.960 --> 03:45:41.480]  could look into it or a call-up or if someone could look into it
[03:45:41.480 --> 03:45:45.400]  would be great because i think people should know if that's a possibility
[03:45:45.400 --> 03:45:49.960]  and that's all i want to say thanks all right thanks yeah i don't i don't know
[03:45:49.960 --> 03:45:52.920]  much about it personally but certainly on the issue of the
[03:45:52.920 --> 03:45:57.160]  hurricanes i mean we saw with Katrina they used that as an excuse to get the
[03:45:57.160 --> 03:46:02.280]  troops in and conduct the disarmament procedure and now
[03:46:02.280 --> 03:46:07.240]  troops according to reports are going to be heading there
[03:46:07.240 --> 03:46:10.440]  you know to deal with the crisis of the oil spill so
[03:46:10.440 --> 03:46:14.600]  and we're going to have to watch that very carefully thanks for the call
[03:46:14.600 --> 03:46:17.320]  stewart and now we're going to go to um
[03:46:17.320 --> 03:46:21.240]  john in north carolina john you are on the air
[03:46:21.240 --> 03:46:26.120]  hey paul thanks for taking my call um about the oil situation
[03:46:26.120 --> 03:46:30.440]  i know there's a large uh a variety of of
[03:46:30.440 --> 03:46:34.520]  a point people have made and it's tough to say really that's my perspective
[03:46:34.520 --> 03:46:37.960]  right now what the nature of it is i think what we know
[03:46:37.960 --> 03:46:42.040]  is that the response was very lackluster very slow and is still very slow in
[03:46:42.040 --> 03:46:45.880]  lackluster and it certainly seems like they're trying to
[03:46:45.880 --> 03:46:49.320]  uh let the fire keep burning and not try to put it out
[03:46:49.320 --> 03:46:54.040]  we i i think we could make that determination don't you think
[03:46:54.040 --> 03:46:58.760]  yeah and what's what's amazing to me is you know this oil spill camera that
[03:46:58.760 --> 03:47:02.760]  we're constantly seeing i mean you can't hope you can barely open up a news
[03:47:02.760 --> 03:47:07.480]  website without seeing it now turn on fox news or cnn
[03:47:07.480 --> 03:47:10.920]  and this oil spill camera shows you second by second
[03:47:10.920 --> 03:47:16.760]  progress of how much is spilling out and that's that was set up by bp so you
[03:47:16.760 --> 03:47:20.040]  think that you know if if they're buying um google
[03:47:20.040 --> 03:47:23.320]  searches which they are then why have they set up this
[03:47:23.320 --> 03:47:28.280]  oil spill camera that constantly reminds people of how bad this disaster is
[03:47:28.280 --> 03:47:32.040]  second by second so that's also something that baffled me
[03:47:32.040 --> 03:47:35.400]  it does seem there's an attempt to um hype this
[03:47:35.400 --> 03:47:39.800]  and uh i mean obviously it's devastating crisis but
[03:47:39.800 --> 03:47:45.960]  at some level bp seemed to be involved in hyping the crisis which is very odd
[03:47:45.960 --> 03:47:50.280]  um unless you consider the fact that they might be trying to
[03:47:50.280 --> 03:47:56.440]  hype it to the extent where massive um quote solutions need to be called for
[03:47:56.440 --> 03:48:00.520]  which obviously lead to um nationalization and
[03:48:00.520 --> 03:48:03.800]  measures like that that we discussed earlier in the show
[03:48:03.800 --> 03:48:07.560]  but thanks for your call um and we've got a lot of callers coming in we're
[03:48:07.560 --> 03:48:13.800]  going to move to uh joe in chicago joe what's on your mind
[03:48:13.800 --> 03:48:22.680]  yes uh mi6 ke y m o i s e
[03:48:22.680 --> 03:48:29.880]  okay thanks for the call uh mike in wyoming you are on the air
[03:48:29.880 --> 03:48:34.600]  welcome yes thanks paul uh the other day i saw an
[03:48:34.600 --> 03:48:39.160]  article of yours that uh suggested that uh
[03:48:39.160 --> 03:48:44.520]  treaties overriding uh the even the constitution itself were
[03:48:44.520 --> 03:48:49.480]  problematic or you know we're uh a matter of debate
[03:48:49.480 --> 03:48:53.720]  and i just want to lay that one to rest uh treaties
[03:48:53.720 --> 03:48:58.920]  necessarily fall underneath the constitution and over statute law
[03:48:58.920 --> 03:49:02.040]  uh otherwise you could use treaties to simply
[03:49:02.040 --> 03:49:05.640]  unravel the constitution itself and the founders uh
[03:49:05.640 --> 03:49:08.680]  the founders weighed in on that they were very explicit
[03:49:08.680 --> 03:49:13.080]  that treaties could did not sit at the same level
[03:49:13.080 --> 03:49:20.360]  uh in terms of their legal status as uh as the constitution
[03:49:20.360 --> 03:49:26.040]  yeah that that was um an article about the this un small arms treaty which
[03:49:26.040 --> 03:49:30.440]  billberg is apparently trying to use uh as an end run around the second
[03:49:30.440 --> 03:49:34.360]  amendment uh and i basically wrote that you know
[03:49:34.360 --> 03:49:37.720]  the notion that a treaty trumps the constitution is a
[03:49:37.720 --> 03:49:44.440]  murky area of debate um from what i read um any such treaty needs senate
[03:49:44.440 --> 03:49:48.120]  approval um but there have been examples in the past
[03:49:48.120 --> 03:49:51.720]  where um it can override the constitution i'm not
[03:49:51.720 --> 03:49:55.560]  saying that's right basically the point i was making was that
[03:49:55.560 --> 03:50:00.440]  um this is what the federal government will claim if they try to push this
[03:50:00.440 --> 03:50:04.040]  through um so yeah you're right i mean it's completely
[03:50:04.040 --> 03:50:08.200]  illegal for it to happen but um this is what they will claim
[03:50:08.200 --> 03:50:11.800]  if they try to get something through like the small arms treaty and then use
[03:50:11.800 --> 03:50:15.240]  it against american citizens um that it
[03:50:15.240 --> 03:50:18.200]  overrides the constitution when obviously it doesn't because it's not
[03:50:18.200 --> 03:50:23.000]  being approved by congress or the senate um thanks for the call mike
[03:50:23.000 --> 03:50:27.960]  and the next caller is diane in florida diane you are on the air

[03:54:33.960 --> 03:54:38.680]  now we didn't get time to get into this but we keep hearing about these
[03:54:38.680 --> 03:54:42.600]  austerity measures we keep seeing the riots in greece
[03:54:42.600 --> 03:54:45.880]  and hear people talking about them coming to america
[03:54:45.880 --> 03:54:49.400]  um but what exactly are these austerity measures
[03:54:49.400 --> 03:54:54.120]  how will they affect us how will they affect our savings our income
[03:54:54.120 --> 03:54:58.360]  our taxes our pensions our public services
[03:54:58.360 --> 03:55:01.800]  we've got an article coming up at prismplanet.com
[03:55:01.800 --> 03:55:06.760]  which delves into this and clarifies exactly why
[03:55:06.760 --> 03:55:10.840]  there are massive riots coming to europe and eventually
[03:55:10.840 --> 03:55:16.760]  america over the next two or three years and this article explains exactly why
[03:55:16.760 --> 03:55:21.720]  when these final few minutes we're going to go to our final couple of callers
[03:55:21.720 --> 03:55:27.800]  and the next one is sunny in ohio sunny you are on the air
[03:55:31.160 --> 03:55:37.880]  sunny dropped off okay we'll go to tereza in california tereza you're on the air
[03:55:37.880 --> 03:55:41.960]  yes thank you thank you uh yes i i know that
[03:55:41.960 --> 03:55:45.880]  based on what i've understood that the one percent elite
[03:55:45.880 --> 03:55:50.600]  on the entire world and are we supposed to arm ourselves with the ammunition and
[03:55:50.600 --> 03:55:53.960]  guns and barricade ourselves in our homes i want to
[03:55:53.960 --> 03:55:57.560]  ask you one more thing if i may please or just make a statement
[03:55:57.560 --> 03:56:01.560]  that they say that conspiracy theory is bogus
[03:56:01.560 --> 03:56:05.480]  well if you look at jerald solante max keiser bob chatman
[03:56:05.480 --> 03:56:10.840]  they all follow suit with the understanding of alice jones
[03:56:10.840 --> 03:56:15.640]  oh i mean the thing that shocks me is you've got people with 200 dollar
[03:56:15.640 --> 03:56:20.520]  haircuts and fancy suits on cmbc saying exactly the same things as
[03:56:20.520 --> 03:56:24.280]  max keiser jerald solante and alex jones
[03:56:24.280 --> 03:56:28.280]  so when it gets to that stage it stops being a conspiracy theory
[03:56:28.280 --> 03:56:31.480]  i mean take for example the article i wrote this morning
[03:56:31.480 --> 03:56:38.040]  um investment banker it's going to get nasty by land barbed wire and guns
[03:56:38.040 --> 03:56:42.600]  and this was a guy on cnbc saying this saying that basically
[03:56:42.600 --> 03:56:48.840]  um you better stock up on gold guns and land because the markets are going south
[03:56:48.840 --> 03:56:53.160]  um the turmoil is only going to get worse and there are going to be riots and
[03:56:53.160 --> 03:56:57.480]  that's exactly what keiser solante and alex jones have been saying for years
[03:56:57.480 --> 03:57:03.240]  so i mean it's gone beyond claiming that this is a conspiracy theory put out by
[03:57:03.240 --> 03:57:08.120]  paranoid insane people that's dead that was five years ago
[03:57:08.120 --> 03:57:11.960]  now we're in it it's manifestly provable and it's happening
[03:57:11.960 --> 03:57:17.240]  um so you know on the face of it it's an open conspiracy as we've emphasized
[03:57:17.240 --> 03:57:20.600]  many times so there's no longer any denial
[03:57:20.600 --> 03:57:26.440]  uh we're going to try sonny again uh sonny in ohio you're on the air
[03:57:26.440 --> 03:57:31.160]  hey get your today there paul okay sonny what's on your mind
[03:57:31.160 --> 03:57:33.880]  well i just wanted to when you were talking about why they are showing the
[03:57:33.880 --> 03:57:38.200]  second by second thing of the camera footage it's the watch the train wreck
[03:57:38.200 --> 03:57:41.720]  scenario that's what it is it's a complete distraction
[03:57:41.720 --> 03:57:44.520]  so you sit there and watch this as a matter of fact the uh
[03:57:44.520 --> 03:57:48.440]  ready to talk show often listened to here in Cincinnati um
[03:57:48.440 --> 03:57:51.640]  the gentleman's a libertarian he was commented about that about the fact
[03:57:51.640 --> 03:57:55.720]  that um he himself was sitting to watch it for like 40 minutes before show prep
[03:57:55.720 --> 03:57:59.240]  the other day i'm just sitting there going what's the purpose
[03:57:59.240 --> 03:58:03.240]  you know but uh they're keeping it totally distracted while they're uh
[03:58:03.240 --> 03:58:06.920]  doing all the wizard behind the curtain things with the cap and tags and
[03:58:06.920 --> 03:58:10.520]  everything else yeah exactly it's a distraction and
[03:58:10.520 --> 03:58:14.840]  the fact that bp put it out there i mean shows that entirely
[03:58:14.840 --> 03:58:18.360]  um but we've come to the end of the show sorry to janice in texas
