[00:00.000 --> 00:03.400]  that could last 15 to 23 years.
[00:03.400 --> 00:09.000]  Today experts are calling for gold to jump from 650 to over $1,000 an ounce or more.
[00:09.000 --> 00:13.080]  We all about it in the latest Future of Gold magazine from Swiss America.
[00:13.080 --> 00:18.280]  Call now toll-free 1-877-703-2193.
[00:18.280 --> 00:40.280]  That's 1-877-703-2193 for the Future of Gold 3.
[00:40.280 --> 00:45.120]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:45.120 --> 00:46.120]  You want answers?
[00:46.120 --> 00:48.120]  Well, so does he.
[00:48.120 --> 00:52.120]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[00:52.120 --> 01:13.120]  And now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:13.120 --> 01:14.120]  Welcome my friends.
[01:14.120 --> 01:15.120]  Welcome.
[01:15.120 --> 01:18.120]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live Monday edition.
[01:18.120 --> 01:21.120]  It is the fifth day of February.
[01:21.120 --> 01:27.120]  2007 will be here live for the next three hours.
[01:27.120 --> 01:36.120]  In 30 minutes we'll be joined by Paul Watson from the United Kingdom to cover three big stories that all point towards the fourth.
[01:36.120 --> 01:43.120]  We have a police chief coming out and saying that the beheading story is nothing but government hype
[01:43.120 --> 01:45.120]  and propaganda.
[01:45.120 --> 01:46.120]  Remember that?
[01:46.120 --> 01:52.120]  Oh, the Islamist plans to chop heads off, kidnap people in England and cut their heads off.
[01:52.120 --> 01:58.120]  Police chief beheading plot being used as distraction from Blair woes.
[01:58.120 --> 02:05.120]  Also, Letterbomb explodes at C-Charge HQ in London.
[02:05.120 --> 02:14.120]  Fury at government delays after bird flu outbreak at the exact spots where they were having a drill the week before.
[02:14.120 --> 02:17.120]  Always a drill whenever it's a government op.
[02:17.120 --> 02:23.120]  Bird flu again breaking out in England in the north.
[02:23.120 --> 02:31.120]  And meanwhile, Tony Blair has to go back into the police station again today to be interrogated about criminal activities in his administration.
[02:31.120 --> 02:40.120]  But that's not in the headlines because they're too busy talking about bombs going off, bird flu and fake beheading stories.
[02:40.120 --> 02:46.120]  And this time it's not out which Jones up here on air telling you this is obviously a political stunt.
[02:46.120 --> 02:49.120]  It's the police chief.
[02:49.120 --> 02:54.120]  People are really starting to get wise to what's happening.
[02:54.120 --> 02:56.120]  So that's coming up.
[02:56.120 --> 03:01.120]  In the meantime, there is massive news concerning the budget concerning Iran.
[03:01.120 --> 03:12.120]  And of course, Governor Rick Perry signing an executive order, trying to order young girls to take a live cancer virus vaccine,
[03:12.120 --> 03:20.120]  which has conclusively been connected to massive autoimmune responses, seizures, bleeding, you name it.
[03:20.120 --> 03:28.120]  We'll be covering the CDC's own warning about this vaccine, but now Dr. Perry, he's not a doctor, but he thinks he is,
[03:28.120 --> 03:36.120]  is admittedly on the payroll of Merck Pharmaceutical and says he doesn't care if the legislature won't pass a law to try to force people to take this.
[03:36.120 --> 03:41.120]  He'll just sign an executive order because he's God.
[03:41.120 --> 03:44.120]  So that's coming up after this first break.
[03:44.120 --> 03:46.120]  We'll get into that first.
[03:46.120 --> 03:49.120]  Bush has sent the biggest budget ever.
[03:49.120 --> 03:53.120]  Clinton's biggest was $1.6 trillion.
[03:53.120 --> 04:03.120]  George Bush's is $2.9 trillion, or $2 trillion, almost $3 trillion.
[04:03.120 --> 04:07.120]  $2.9 trillion.
[04:07.120 --> 04:10.120]  And that's not counting off budget.
[04:10.120 --> 04:24.120]  Now the war is, well, it's been over $100 billion a year. Now Bush is asking for $249 billion supplemental, clearly wanting to go into Iran.
[04:24.120 --> 04:27.120]  If you think that's for Iraq, you think the troops are just for Iraq.
[04:27.120 --> 04:32.120]  No, the troops are just to build up troops, so they have more troops to go into Iran that are in the region,
[04:32.120 --> 04:37.120]  and also to make the debate not be about pulling troops out, but about the increase.
[04:37.120 --> 04:41.120]  So we have that. The Democrats are saying they're now going to try to, quote,
[04:41.120 --> 04:48.120]  close tax loopholes or go after unpaid taxes and increase enforcement and audits.
[04:48.120 --> 04:52.120]  Ah, the good old Democrats. Democrats in Congress set sights on unpaid taxes.
[04:52.120 --> 04:54.120]  This is something the Bushes always do.
[04:54.120 --> 05:00.120]  They cut taxes and then increase enforcement and believe the Democrats are taking his orders.
[05:00.120 --> 05:05.120]  According to an article in Monday's New York Times, Democrats in Congress are hoping to finance an ambitious agenda
[05:05.120 --> 05:09.120]  without raising taxes by collecting part of the 300 billion estimated to be lost
[05:09.120 --> 05:12.120]  every year due to unreported earnings.
[05:12.120 --> 05:19.120]  USX generals reject Iran's strike. Iran unveils herbal remedy against AIDS.
[05:19.120 --> 05:27.120]  It's all coming up. Huge broadcast lined up here on the one and only Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[05:27.120 --> 05:35.120]  I'm going to leave you alone.
[05:35.120 --> 05:42.120]  It's here after a year in production and traveling the distant lands.
[05:42.120 --> 05:44.120]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[05:44.120 --> 05:49.120]  Shocking, declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks
[05:49.120 --> 05:52.120]  against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[05:52.120 --> 06:00.120]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[06:00.120 --> 06:06.120]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news,
[06:06.120 --> 06:12.120]  NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[06:12.120 --> 06:16.120]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorists.
[06:16.120 --> 06:18.120]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[06:18.120 --> 06:22.120]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[06:35.120 --> 06:40.120]  The Berkey Security Pack is your one-stop solution for unexpected emergencies.
[06:40.120 --> 06:45.120]  It provides you with purified water, light, power, and communications ability.
[06:45.120 --> 06:51.120]  The security pack includes a Berkey light water purifier and LED base, two Berkey sport filtration bottles,
[06:51.120 --> 06:59.120]  the Berkey battery adapter, the Berkey MP solar charger, as well as a backup set of two black Berkey purification elements.
[06:59.120 --> 07:05.120]  The Berkey security pack is important every day and a must during emergencies because it provides purified water,
[07:05.120 --> 07:10.120]  long-term low-energy lighting, backup battery power for your Berkey LEDs,
[07:10.120 --> 07:16.120]  free long-term solar power for communications devices such as radios, walkie-talkies, and cell phones,

[07:27.120 --> 07:34.120]  by calling new millennium at triple-8803-4438, not yet available in Iowa.
[07:34.120 --> 07:41.120]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[07:41.120 --> 07:43.120]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[07:43.120 --> 07:46.120]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough,
[07:46.120 --> 07:50.120]  the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[07:50.120 --> 07:56.120]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Wright discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[07:56.120 --> 08:02.120]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions
[08:02.120 --> 08:04.120]  with no side effects.
[08:04.120 --> 08:09.120]  The 2006 BioSolutions Plus is the easiest to operate frequency instrument ever developed.
[08:09.120 --> 08:13.120]  Its easy reference guide will allow you to begin using the instrument within minutes.
[08:13.120 --> 08:17.120]  Simple step-by-step instructions using pictures are easy to follow.

[08:20.120 --> 08:22.120]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.
[08:22.120 --> 08:28.120]  For more information, call BioSolutions toll-free, 1-866-885-6625.
[08:28.120 --> 08:35.120]  That's 1-866-885-6625. 1-866-885-6625.
[08:40.120 --> 08:45.120]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[08:45.120 --> 08:46.120]  You want answers?
[08:46.120 --> 08:48.120]  Well, so does he.
[08:48.120 --> 08:52.120]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[08:52.120 --> 09:00.120]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[09:00.120 --> 09:12.120]  Alright, Paul Watson with the incredible developments taking place over an airstrip one known as the United Kingdom, the capital of Oceania.
[09:12.120 --> 09:16.120]  We'll get into the latest developments and I ran what's happening with a new mega-budget.
[09:16.120 --> 09:23.120]  And that's just the stuff that's on budget by George W., the end of America, Bush.
[09:23.120 --> 09:29.120]  But first, let me get directly into Rick Perry in Texas.
[09:29.120 --> 09:36.120]  And it doesn't matter where you live, whether it's in Illinois or Indiana, where the victors live.
[09:36.120 --> 09:45.120]  It doesn't matter if you're tuning in to New York or Florida or Georgia or Ohio or California or New Mexico.
[09:45.120 --> 09:48.120]  All 50 states have been lobbied.
[09:48.120 --> 09:49.120]  The press is reported.
[09:49.120 --> 09:50.120]  The AP is reported.
[09:50.120 --> 09:57.120]  It is Merck Pharmaceutical's biggest single lobbying effort ever.
[09:57.120 --> 09:58.120]  Quite a product.
[09:58.120 --> 10:01.120]  You just go to the government and pay them off and they try to make you take it.
[10:01.120 --> 10:02.120]  What is it?
[10:02.120 --> 10:04.120]  We talked about it Friday.
[10:04.120 --> 10:09.120]  Live, genetically engineered cancer virus.
[10:09.120 --> 10:18.120]  Live virus to be given to every woman in the country by age 10 or 11.
[10:18.120 --> 10:20.120]  And some states are pushing for age 8.
[10:20.120 --> 10:23.120]  In Texas, it's 11.
[10:23.120 --> 10:28.120]  All over the country, states are revolting and saying no.
[10:28.120 --> 10:32.120]  It doesn't matter how many politicians Merck has in their hip pocket.
[10:32.120 --> 10:37.120]  Well, we always do things, I guess, bigger and better, but now it's bigger and worse here in Texas.
[10:37.120 --> 10:44.120]  Governor Rick Perry, the guy who says, I don't care of 97% major polls, don't want a foreign company to have tolls on existing roads.
[10:44.120 --> 10:45.120]  I'm going to do it.
[10:45.120 --> 10:47.120]  I don't care if people don't want open borders.
[10:47.120 --> 10:50.120]  I'm going to do it.
[10:50.120 --> 10:53.120]  And he does this on every issue.
[10:53.120 --> 11:00.120]  He comes out Friday afternoon and announces an executive order in every newspaper in the state.
[11:00.120 --> 11:05.120]  I mean, every newspaper I saw and I looked up dozens of them and papers all over the country.
[11:05.120 --> 11:09.120]  And the nightly news nationally reported, it's the law.
[11:09.120 --> 11:17.120]  Girls must take the new anti-cancer vaccine.
[11:17.120 --> 11:25.120]  Now, number one, this goes to the heart of the whole vaccine issue.
[11:25.120 --> 11:28.120]  Not whether they're safe, not whether they're good, not whether.
[11:28.120 --> 11:40.120]  No, the fact that there is a massive ongoing international hoax in the Western world two months before each school year starts to announce,
[11:40.120 --> 11:41.120]  it's the law.
[11:41.120 --> 11:47.120]  You must take this list of vaccines now rising above 40.
[11:47.120 --> 11:53.120]  And you remember many of you just 20 years ago when it was five or six vaccines.
[11:53.120 --> 11:55.120]  Now they're jumping every year.
[11:55.120 --> 11:56.120]  Oh, it's 34.
[11:56.120 --> 11:58.120]  Oh, now it's 40.
[11:58.120 --> 12:00.120]  Now it's 44.
[12:00.120 --> 12:04.120]  Hundreds of new vaccines being developed every year.
[12:04.120 --> 12:10.120]  Most of them aren't the classical vaccine where you've got a dead bacteria or a dead virus and the body recognizes it.
[12:10.120 --> 12:18.120]  And then, of course, the problem is everything else that was in the shot along with it or all the research from major universities and scientific institutions
[12:18.120 --> 12:27.120]  showing that even, quote, good vaccines that do give you immunity to the tetanus or to the hepatitis or whatever it may be,
[12:27.120 --> 12:35.120]  that it then causes a bunch of other allergies inside the body and causes the body to start attacking itself.
[12:35.120 --> 12:51.120]  Because many times there's a lot of other trash DNA material in there that then binds to your own cells.
[13:05.120 --> 13:23.120]  In fact, a caller called about this last night on my Sunday syndicated show we're doing from 4 to 6 p.m. Central
[13:23.120 --> 13:30.120]  and said, yeah, 30 years, my dad's been a dentist.
[13:30.120 --> 13:33.120]  And they do make medical workers take it.
[13:33.120 --> 13:36.120]  That's the only place that there really is a law.
[13:36.120 --> 13:39.120]  Let me be clear about this.
[13:39.120 --> 13:45.120]  There is no law that anyone who is not a medical worker, there is no law anywhere.
[13:45.120 --> 13:54.120]  Unless you're a dentist, an oral surgeon, a doctor, a nurse, there is no law that you have to take any vaccine.
[13:54.120 --> 14:03.120]  And then it's only a regulatory law with the doctors and the medical workers.
[14:03.120 --> 14:07.120]  So let me get back to what I was talking about with Rick Perry.
[14:07.120 --> 14:09.120]  There's this massive hoax.
[14:09.120 --> 14:18.120]  He comes out and he announces in every newspaper, Dallas Morning News, Houston Chronicles, San Antonio Express News,
[14:18.120 --> 14:24.120]  I mean, I went by the news racks, I went online, every one of them said different variants.
[14:24.120 --> 14:26.120]  I have a whole folder of them here.
[14:26.120 --> 14:29.120]  Perry requires HPV vaccine for girls.
[14:29.120 --> 14:31.120]  Let me read you some more headlines.
[14:31.120 --> 14:33.120]  Texas requires cancer vaccine for girls.
[14:33.120 --> 14:34.120]  Let me read another one.
[14:34.120 --> 14:39.120]  Texas Governor issues executive order requiring anti-cancer vaccine for schoolgirls.
[14:39.120 --> 14:44.120]  I mean, I have a huge stack of probably, I didn't count them, 20 articles here.
[14:44.120 --> 14:49.120]  One paper told the truth, I hate this paper, it normally lies continually.
[14:49.120 --> 14:53.120]  It's the un-American statesman, the Austin American statesman.
[14:53.120 --> 14:57.120]  They told the truth, but they also lied.
[14:57.120 --> 15:07.120]  Perry requires HPV vaccine for girls, sub-headline, parents can opt out of project targeting cancer-causing virus.
[15:07.120 --> 15:13.120]  So there's a spin there, but at least they told the truth in the second headline.
[15:13.120 --> 15:17.120]  So even if you're for this vaccine and you totally trust the government,
[15:17.120 --> 15:22.120]  and Big Pharma, Merck that brought you Vioxx and the rest of it,
[15:22.120 --> 15:29.120]  is it a good thing to be lied to?
[15:29.120 --> 15:34.120]  And is it a good thing to have a governor, and that's in the press reports as well,
[15:34.120 --> 15:37.120]  that when the legislature says this is wildly unpopular,
[15:37.120 --> 15:43.120]  there's no way we're going to pass this in the next legislative session.
[15:43.120 --> 15:47.120]  So what does the governor do?
[15:47.120 --> 15:50.120]  The governor says, well, I'm ordering it, and he gets up.
[15:50.120 --> 15:52.120]  I found a video that, and I forgot to give it to you, John.
[15:52.120 --> 15:55.120]  Go look up, just type in a YouTube or something like that.
[15:55.120 --> 15:59.120]  Type in, Rick Perry cancer vaccine.
[15:59.120 --> 16:01.120]  And we should be able to find his press conference.
[16:01.120 --> 16:06.120]  I did find it over the weekend and forgot to send it up to the network in Minnesota.
[16:06.120 --> 16:08.120]  That's how it works.
[16:08.120 --> 16:11.120]  I find the clips, I'll send them to him.
[16:11.120 --> 16:13.120]  And he just said, you must take it.
[16:13.120 --> 16:15.120]  This is to keep girls safe.
[16:15.120 --> 16:18.120]  It's just like the polio vaccine.
[16:18.120 --> 16:25.120]  No, polio killed tens of thousands and maimed millions, including my grandmother.
[16:25.120 --> 16:28.120]  And a lot of evidence shows that was a government-created bio-weapon.
[16:28.120 --> 16:33.120]  And, by the way, it was infected with SV40 cancer virus
[16:33.120 --> 16:38.120]  that has been attributed to much of the rise of cancer, the cocktail of reasons
[16:38.120 --> 16:44.120]  that cancer has exploded all over the world.
[16:44.120 --> 16:48.120]  So Rick Perry gets up and says, it's the law you've got to do it,
[16:48.120 --> 16:51.120]  because he signed an executive order, and you read the executive order.
[16:51.120 --> 16:56.120]  It just says he's recommending it as all other vaccines are recommended.
[16:56.120 --> 17:00.120]  All they are is recommended, but they get in the school, they'll tell you, it's the law,
[17:00.120 --> 17:04.120]  they get arrested, the news every year tells you, get vaccinated, it's the law,
[17:04.120 --> 17:08.120]  at Zilker Park or at the football stadium or wherever you live, the name of your park,
[17:08.120 --> 17:11.120]  show up, get your free shots, you'll be kicked out of school,
[17:11.120 --> 17:13.120]  and then you'll be arrested for truancy.
[17:13.120 --> 17:15.120]  And that's how they bring a law in.
[17:15.120 --> 17:18.120]  They kick you out for something they can't kick you out for.
[17:18.120 --> 17:25.120]  Then they bring in truancy, and then they use that to trigger criminal sanctions.
[17:25.120 --> 17:29.120]  It's fraud, it's extortion, it's racketeering, it's blackmail.
[17:29.120 --> 17:32.120]  Those things look up their definitions.
[17:32.120 --> 17:34.120]  So we have a huge hoax going here.
[17:34.120 --> 17:48.120]  Then we have the vaccine itself, a live cancer virus, live, L-I-V-E, live.
[17:48.120 --> 17:51.120]  And even, and I'm going to read this after the break, on there,
[17:51.120 --> 18:00.120]  even the centers for disease control in Atlanta who will approve cyanide as mother's milk.
[18:00.120 --> 18:01.120]  They'll approve anything.
[18:01.120 --> 18:06.120]  I've never seen, the CDC, it's the FDA that approves, but they would never put out a warning on anything.
[18:06.120 --> 18:14.120]  They've come out and said, don't take this, this is causing major problems.
[18:14.120 --> 18:17.120]  So the vaccine basically is in trouble, Merck was counting on it,
[18:17.120 --> 18:20.120]  and so it was a PR move to make it look like it's okay.
[18:20.120 --> 18:25.120]  The governor says you've got to take it because it's being shot down at state after state.
[18:25.120 --> 18:27.120]  What does Rick Perry do?
[18:27.120 --> 18:31.120]  Completely blackmailed, completely controlled himself.
[18:31.120 --> 18:34.120]  And Texans know why.
[18:34.120 --> 18:41.120]  He comes out and just says, you've got to take it.
[18:41.120 --> 18:43.120]  It's off the charts.
[18:43.120 --> 18:47.120]  This is Vaccine Center Issues Warning.
[18:47.120 --> 18:50.120]  Washington Times, the National Vaccine Information Center yesterday,
[18:50.120 --> 18:54.120]  warned state officials who investigate the safety of a breakthrough cancer vaccine
[18:54.120 --> 18:58.120]  as Texas became the first state to make the vaccine mandatory for school-aged girls.
[18:58.120 --> 19:02.120]  The American Medical Association recommended not taking it as well, I would add.
[19:02.120 --> 19:07.120]  Continuing, negative side effects of the new vaccine, a Merck vaccine,
[19:07.120 --> 19:10.120]  to prevent the sexually transmitted virus that causes cervical cancer,
[19:10.120 --> 19:14.120]  are being reported in the District of Columbia and 20 states, including Virginia.
[19:14.120 --> 19:18.120]  The reactions range from loss of consciousness to seizures.
[19:18.120 --> 19:23.120]  Quote, young girls are experiencing severe headaches, dizziness, temporary loss of vision,
[19:23.120 --> 19:27.120]  and some girls have lost consciousness during what appear to be seizures.
[19:27.120 --> 19:31.120]  Remember, we were talking about cases Friday where the girl takes it
[19:31.120 --> 19:35.120]  and suddenly they're bleeding out of every orifice and have an autoimmune shot down.
[19:35.120 --> 19:39.120]  Just like the troops are dying and getting ill from the experimental shots they're being given.
[19:39.120 --> 19:43.120]  We'll explain why when we get back.
[19:43.120 --> 19:47.120]  But there's so many facets to this, and we'll open the phones up in the second hour
[19:47.120 --> 19:50.120]  and talk about it. Paul Watson joins us in 10 minutes.
[19:50.120 --> 19:54.120]  Quick segment, then we'll bring Paul Watson on shift gears to Tony Blair,
[19:54.120 --> 19:58.120]  fighting for his Prime Minister's shift, big developments there,
[19:58.120 --> 20:04.120]  and then the second and third hour wide open phones, a ton of national and global news.
[20:04.120 --> 20:07.120]  Stay with us.
[20:07.120 --> 20:12.120]  Black working purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[20:12.120 --> 20:15.120]  These awesome elements are used in burky purification systems,
[20:15.120 --> 20:19.120]  and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[20:19.120 --> 20:25.120]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites,
[20:25.120 --> 20:30.120]  trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and M-T-B-E.
[20:30.120 --> 20:35.120]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[20:35.120 --> 20:40.120]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particular from water like food coloring particles.
[20:40.120 --> 20:43.120]  Yes, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[20:43.120 --> 20:47.120]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black burky elements are more economical
[20:47.120 --> 20:53.120]  than the standard disposable elements providing fresh, pure water for less than 2 cents per gallon.
[20:53.120 --> 20:57.120]  Get a 2-pack for only $99 or a 4-pack for only $188
[20:57.120 --> 21:01.120]  by calling new millennium at 888-803-4438.
[21:01.120 --> 21:06.120]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at burkywater.com.
[21:06.120 --> 21:11.120]  Ted Anderson from Midas, February 5, 2007, Gold 649.
[21:11.120 --> 21:17.120]  Outskull coins are 670, 85, 337, 79 for half, 168, 99 for quarter ounce.
[21:17.120 --> 21:21.120]  That's 670, 85, 337, 79, and 168, 99.
[21:21.120 --> 21:23.120]  1971, Nixon closes the gold window.
[21:23.120 --> 21:25.120]  Fiat currency, 1920s.
[21:25.120 --> 21:28.120]  The German market explodes from 75 to 23 trillion.
[21:28.120 --> 21:31.120]  1995, gold doubles against the Mexican peso.
[21:31.120 --> 21:36.120]  1997, gold increases 82% over the Indonesian rupee.
[21:36.120 --> 21:38.120]  1998, gold jumps two-thirds over the Russian ruble.
[21:38.120 --> 21:42.120]  2002, the Argentine peso loses a fifth of its value to gold.
[21:42.120 --> 21:46.120]  2006, the last superpower of the USA's mighty dollar loses over half to gold.
[21:46.120 --> 21:47.120]  And other raw goods.
[21:47.120 --> 21:49.120]  Could government let this happen?
[21:49.120 --> 21:51.120]  Without immediate backing, how much will it lose?
[21:51.120 --> 21:54.120]  Midas has Nick Bareship's report covering the loss of purchasing power,
[21:54.120 --> 21:58.120]  fat tail events, bull market, economic vulnerabilities, and gold oil relationship.
[21:58.120 --> 22:04.120]  You've lost half of your purchasing power. Call 800-686-2237 before the rest disappears.
[22:04.120 --> 22:07.120]  That's 800-686-2237.
[22:09.120 --> 22:12.120]  David J. Smith for NewsWatch Magazine.
[22:12.120 --> 22:18.120]  Did you know that the United Nations basic philosophy is both anti-American and pro-dictatorship?
[22:18.120 --> 22:23.120]  Did you know that the United Nations was founded by communists and marchists members
[22:23.120 --> 22:29.120]  of the Council on Foreign Relations whose goal is a socialistic one-world government?
[22:29.120 --> 22:33.120]  We would like to help you understand why these things are happening
[22:33.120 --> 22:40.120]  and how they fulfill Bible prophecy by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to NewsWatch Magazine.

[23:08.120 --> 23:10.120]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[23:10.120 --> 23:16.120]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer
[23:16.120 --> 23:20.120]  and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[23:20.120 --> 23:28.120]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[23:28.120 --> 23:31.120]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die.
[23:31.120 --> 23:37.120]  With laced med inks, patented methodology, without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation,
[23:37.120 --> 23:45.120]  we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[23:45.120 --> 23:48.120]  Laser technology at its best.

[24:01.120 --> 24:16.120]  Call 702-953-0267.
[24:16.120 --> 24:24.120]  So, there is a massive concerted media effort nationally to lie and say that there's laws that you have to take vaccines.
[24:24.120 --> 24:28.120]  Unless you're a medical worker, medical professional, that is not the case.
[24:28.120 --> 24:35.120]  And those are only regulatory, and I've seen cases of it being contested and beaten.
[24:35.120 --> 24:37.120]  So they're lying on that front.
[24:37.120 --> 24:42.120]  Then they're trying to set the precedent to put in your body and your children's bodies whatever they want.
[24:42.120 --> 24:47.120]  And there's over 100 new vaccines developed globally and approved each year,
[24:47.120 --> 24:54.120]  so they need to force you to take these so they go to the big pharma companies and lobby government.
[24:54.120 --> 24:57.120]  Completely unethical.
[24:57.120 --> 24:58.120]  Make you buy your product.
[24:58.120 --> 25:04.120]  One shot of this cost $300.
[25:04.120 --> 25:05.120]  It's here in the articles.
[25:05.120 --> 25:07.120]  It's $360-something.
[25:07.120 --> 25:09.120]  Let me just find it.
[25:09.120 --> 25:10.120]  My memory fails me.
[25:10.120 --> 25:13.120]  It says they'll make tens of billions a year on it.
[25:13.120 --> 25:14.120]  You can go read all the articles.
[25:14.120 --> 25:17.120]  I know it's $360-something.
[25:17.120 --> 25:18.120]  I'll find it. Hold on.
[25:18.120 --> 25:19.120]  No, it doesn't matter.
[25:19.120 --> 25:24.120]  The point is it's $360-plus smackers.
[25:24.120 --> 25:29.120]  It's $300-plus for it.
[25:29.120 --> 25:35.120]  And it's a live cancer virus with massive medical effects.
[25:35.120 --> 25:38.120]  I mean, the CDC is saying, whoa, more study.
[25:38.120 --> 25:39.120]  Don't take it.
[25:39.120 --> 25:44.120]  American Medical Association, who, again, will do whatever they're told, bought and paid for by a big pharma.
[25:44.120 --> 25:45.120]  They're saying no.
[25:45.120 --> 25:48.120]  Even local Neocontox show host this morning, I heard one of them.
[25:48.120 --> 25:52.120]  Some of my crew heard another show going, this is horrible, Rick Perry.
[25:52.120 --> 25:54.120]  You need to be out of office.
[25:54.120 --> 25:57.120]  Everybody I know is mad about this.
[25:57.120 --> 25:59.120]  And they don't even know it's a live cancer virus.
[25:59.120 --> 26:02.120]  Now, let me explain how this works.
[26:02.120 --> 26:04.120]  They go in and they cut off.
[26:04.120 --> 26:09.120]  They go into the cancer virus in its protein envelope.
[26:09.120 --> 26:19.120]  And they go in and they chop a large portion of the DNA coding strand out of the virus.
[26:19.120 --> 26:30.120]  And so your body then supposedly is able to then recognize the virus and create an immunity to it before you're ever exposed to it.
[26:30.120 --> 26:37.120]  But of course, when they're trying to separate viruses out, when they're trying to manipulate your DNA,
[26:37.120 --> 26:47.120]  you will get mutations when they're alive, creating billions of them per vat in these big centrifuges where they grow them and then centrifuge them out.
[26:47.120 --> 26:55.120]  Other viruses from the production, they use, of course, fetal tissue, dead babies in some of the procedures.
[26:55.120 --> 27:11.120]  In some of the other vaccine procedures, they use egg yolks, but the original seed that is line of development of the viruses was grown in humans or monkeys with human tissues cheaper, baby tissues cheaper than monkey tissue.
[27:11.120 --> 27:13.120]  So they breed this stuff up.
[27:13.120 --> 27:16.120]  The original source is from dead humans.
[27:16.120 --> 27:26.120]  Then they go and they plot it out on egg tops and you're going to get mutations.
[27:26.120 --> 27:29.120]  And this is what's happened when they studied every major vaccine.
[27:29.120 --> 27:38.120]  It's just filled with a cocktail of who knows what DNA strands, mycoplasms, nanobacteria, which we talked about 10 years ago.
[27:38.120 --> 27:39.120]  Now it's mainstream news.
[27:39.120 --> 27:41.120]  There's just nanobacteria everywhere.
[27:41.120 --> 27:47.120]  There are bacteria that live in bacteria and bacteria that live on those bacteria.
[27:47.120 --> 27:54.120]  So there's just, it's incredible that this is happening.
[27:54.120 --> 27:56.120]  An experimental vaccine.
[27:56.120 --> 27:58.120]  The governor says it's the law.
[27:58.120 --> 27:59.120]  There is no law.
[27:59.120 --> 28:01.120]  It costs $360 plus.
[28:01.120 --> 28:02.120]  They're in the break.
[28:02.120 --> 28:04.120]  I'll try to find it and give you the actual number.
[28:04.120 --> 28:06.120]  I know it's 360 something.
[28:06.120 --> 28:17.120]  And they're having adverse health response to it, major death, seizures, accelerated autoimmune diseases.
[28:17.120 --> 28:19.120]  All of this is happening.
[28:19.120 --> 28:24.120]  And Merck, it turns out, it's all over the news here.
[28:24.120 --> 28:26.120]  Well, here's the Associated Press.
[28:26.120 --> 28:30.120]  Merck has bankrolling efforts to pass laws and state legislatures across the country,
[28:30.120 --> 28:34.120]  mandating that the Gardasil vaccine for girls as young as 11.
[28:34.120 --> 28:39.120]  It doubled its lobbying budget in Texas and has funded money through women in government.
[28:39.120 --> 28:42.120]  An advocacy group made up of female state legislators around the country.
[28:42.120 --> 28:44.120]  The tales of the order were not immediately available.
[28:44.120 --> 28:50.120]  The governor's office confirmed, now we have it, that the Associated President was signed the order and would comment Friday.
[28:50.120 --> 28:53.120]  Perry has several ties to Merck and women in government.
[28:53.120 --> 28:59.120]  And it goes on to say one of the drug companies, three lobbyists in Texas, is Mike Toomey, his former chief of staff.
[28:59.120 --> 29:04.120]  So Perry's former chief of staff is on the Merck payroll.
[29:04.120 --> 29:10.120]  His current chief of staff's mother-in-law, Texas Republican, state representative Diane White Delasus,
[29:10.120 --> 29:13.120]  is a state director for women in government.
[29:13.120 --> 29:18.120]  Toomey was expected to be able to woo conservative legislatures concerned about the requirement.
[29:18.120 --> 29:19.120]  They did the math.
[29:19.120 --> 29:26.120]  If all women in Texas took it out of the 30 million now, or what is it, what is it, 27 million in the state,
[29:26.120 --> 29:30.120]  they're talking about over two billion dollars.
[29:30.120 --> 29:35.120]  And of course 50 states, it just says tens of billions.
[29:35.120 --> 29:38.120]  It was another point I wanted to make, but it's not coming to mind here.
[29:38.120 --> 29:40.120]  There's so many facets to this.
[29:40.120 --> 29:43.120]  We'll be talking about it in the second and third hour along with Iran news.
[29:43.120 --> 29:44.120]  A lot more.
[29:44.120 --> 29:50.120]  Paul Watson with Tony Blair, he was about to be removed last week and suddenly bombs.
[29:50.120 --> 29:57.120]  The headings, bird flu just all came out of the jack-in-the-box.
[29:57.120 --> 29:59.120]  We're on the march.
[29:59.120 --> 30:01.120]  The empire's on the run.
[30:01.120 --> 30:09.120]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[30:09.120 --> 30:12.120]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here with an important question.

[34:23.120 --> 34:34.120]  Absolutely, ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us.
[34:34.120 --> 34:39.120]  We're going to go to Paul Watson in just one moment with incredible updates and big developments in the UK.
[34:39.120 --> 34:44.120]  I'm basically part of the Anglo-American conglomeration, the criminal empire.
[34:44.120 --> 34:49.120]  And we really appreciate his hard work and analysis along with his brother, Steve Watson.
[34:49.120 --> 34:55.120]  But before we do that, I hope that each and every one of you will visit prisonplanet.tv.
[34:55.120 --> 35:01.120]  We only increase the services for our members. We only try to make it better.
[35:01.120 --> 35:15.120]  I mean, it's like three special reports with Aaron Russo, video interview, the occult elite, live events, speeches I've given, other documentary films, all 15 of mine.
[35:15.120 --> 35:22.120]  My book, Paul Watson's book, order out of chaos, elite sponsored terror in the New World Order, not even available in print anymore.
[35:22.120 --> 35:26.120]  You can get it there as an e-book free, of course, with your membership.
[35:26.120 --> 35:30.120]  So I guess it's not free, but you know what I mean, print them off and give them out to people for free.
[35:30.120 --> 35:35.120]  And it's an amazing, just absolutely amazing, activist tool.
[35:35.120 --> 35:41.120]  We have it in super high bandwidth, high bandwidth, medium and low on the big releases.
[35:41.120 --> 35:47.120]  What else is in three formats? Well, it's in two different formats and then three to four different grades of quality.
[35:47.120 --> 35:50.120]  You can just sit there on DVDs or discs, just burning.
[35:50.120 --> 35:53.120]  Oh, I like this TV show Alex did. I like this interview he did in studio.
[35:53.120 --> 36:00.120]  Oh, I like this special report they did. Oh, I think this will be informative for my pastor, or this will be good for my professor, or this will be good for my school teacher.
[36:00.120 --> 36:04.120]  It is a dynamo of political activism.
[36:04.120 --> 36:09.120]  You go in there, you download whatever you want, thousands and thousands and thousands of pieces of media.
[36:09.120 --> 36:12.120]  The third anniversary will be in April.
[36:12.120 --> 36:17.120]  April 1st, we kicked this thing off three years ago.
[36:17.120 --> 36:26.120]  And we know everybody's been sharing their passcode, so it slowed down last week, so I doubled the bandwidth and added a whole other server.
[36:26.120 --> 36:32.120]  And as much as I like people sharing their passwords, it becomes a problem for those of you that are members.
[36:32.120 --> 36:39.120]  And then it kills me in the pocketbook, but I'll continue to expand it to keep it flowing nicely and working well.
[36:39.120 --> 36:49.120]  But if somebody gave you a passcode, why not go pay $5.95 a month and get your own membership so we can run this operation here?
[36:49.120 --> 36:54.120]  Because I got Aaron Dyke's pretty much working full time, uploading the videos, editing them, putting them up there.
[36:54.120 --> 37:00.120]  Stephen Paul, of course, are able to live off the revenue from prisonplanet.tv. We fund all the servers with it.
[37:00.120 --> 37:05.120]  So you're also supporting us when you go to prisonplanet.tv membership, but it's such a great deal.
[37:05.120 --> 37:07.120]  And I want to thank all of you that are members.
[37:07.120 --> 37:09.120]  And if you let your membership lapse, please renew it.
[37:09.120 --> 37:13.120]  And if you haven't tried a trial monthly for $5.95, go get one today.
[37:13.120 --> 37:17.120]  It takes just a minute or two to sign up, prisonplanet.tv.
[37:17.120 --> 37:22.120]  Or you can simply go to infowars.com via the Safe Secure Online Shopping Cart
[37:22.120 --> 37:30.120]  and order any of my 15 films, any of the 50-something other videos we carry, dozens and dozens of other books we carry,

[37:32.120 --> 37:37.120]  Huge, secure online video and bookstore shopping cart at infowars.com.
[37:37.120 --> 37:39.120]  You can also link through at prisonplanet.com.
[37:39.120 --> 37:41.120]  We've got Terrorist Farm as low as $9.95.
[37:41.120 --> 37:45.120]  We've got American Dictators as low as $5.95.
[37:45.120 --> 37:49.120]  We've got 9-11 Inside Job T-shirts for $9.95.
[37:49.120 --> 37:56.120]  And these are the nice, you know, beefy tees, you know, nice cotton t-shirts.
[37:56.120 --> 37:59.120]  I'll just tell you, an XX large cost is $6.
[37:59.120 --> 38:01.120]  The others cost us like $4.50 to $5.
[38:01.120 --> 38:03.120]  I mean, we're not really making anything here.
[38:03.120 --> 38:05.120]  It's about getting it out to you.
[38:05.120 --> 38:07.120]  It's about getting the word out.
[38:07.120 --> 38:09.120]  It's about taking action.
[38:09.120 --> 38:15.120]  And every order we get gets a free citizen rulebook stuck in it,
[38:15.120 --> 38:19.120]  because a 69-page-able-color-cover booklet with the Bill of Rights Constitution,
[38:19.120 --> 38:22.120]  Declaration of Independence, jury notification, famous quotes.
[38:22.120 --> 38:25.120]  I mean, I think I know a lot about the Constitution Bill of Rights,
[38:25.120 --> 38:28.120]  but it's a lot to know in that 69-page booklet.
[38:28.120 --> 38:30.120]  I've probably read it 10 times over the years.
[38:30.120 --> 38:31.120]  That's not enough.
[38:31.120 --> 38:32.120]  You should all get it.
[38:32.120 --> 38:33.120]  You should keep it by your nightstand.
[38:33.120 --> 38:34.120]  Keep it in the bathroom.
[38:34.120 --> 38:36.120]  Keep them on the coffee table.
[38:36.120 --> 38:38.120]  You can buy them in bulk.
[38:38.120 --> 38:40.120]  We sell them at cost to you.
[38:40.120 --> 38:43.120]  At cost.
[38:43.120 --> 38:46.120]  That is, let's say I buy thousands of these,
[38:46.120 --> 38:48.120]  and I'm getting them for $0.50 a piece,
[38:48.120 --> 38:51.120]  and so you end up buying them in bulk for me for like $0.60 a piece.
[38:51.120 --> 38:53.120]  You know, the $0.10 you're selling for somebody to stick them in the thing
[38:53.120 --> 38:54.120]  and mail it to you.
[38:54.120 --> 38:56.120]  I don't think that even pays for the shipping.
[38:56.120 --> 38:58.120]  But yes, I'm quite a businessman here.
[38:58.120 --> 39:03.120]  The job is just to get the information out, not to make capital.
[39:03.120 --> 39:06.120]  And it goes right back into the operation.
[39:06.120 --> 39:11.120]  So please, call toll-free to get American freedom to fascism or terror storm
[39:11.120 --> 39:17.120]  9-11 demolitions, 9-11 mysteries demolitions,
[39:17.120 --> 39:19.120]  or at least change second edition.
[39:19.120 --> 39:29.120]  It's all available at infoawards.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139-888-253-3139.
[39:29.120 --> 39:35.120]  You can just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, sweet 100,
[39:35.120 --> 39:38.120]  Austin, Texas 787-04.
[39:38.120 --> 39:40.120]  All right, let's go to Paul Watson.
[39:40.120 --> 39:45.120]  Bird flu, the deadly bird flu breaks out and kills thousands of turkeys.
[39:45.120 --> 39:48.120]  Then it turns out they were really killing the turkeys.
[39:48.120 --> 39:51.120]  We have police chief, this is the headline,
[39:51.120 --> 39:55.120]  police chief beheading plot being used as a distraction from Blair Rose,
[39:55.120 --> 39:58.120]  UK Daily Mail, by the London Telegraph.
[39:58.120 --> 40:03.120]  Letter bomb explodes at CCHARG HQ in London, UK Daily Mail,
[40:03.120 --> 40:05.120]  and a bunch of other stuff.
[40:05.120 --> 40:08.120]  And I, of course, I instant message you Friday and said,
[40:08.120 --> 40:10.120]  pretty obvious, Paul.
[40:10.120 --> 40:13.120]  Of course, little, I know you already written an article that you posted that day,
[40:13.120 --> 40:17.120]  hours after you'd already done the research, you're there,
[40:17.120 --> 40:21.120]  that it was clearly Blair pulling out stops, staging events.
[40:21.120 --> 40:23.120]  I mean, it's the same MO, same signature.
[40:23.120 --> 40:27.120]  Once you watch these people, you know they're every step before they even do it.
[40:27.120 --> 40:29.120]  The bomb going off today, it's even more obvious.
[40:29.120 --> 40:32.120]  Fill us in in detail on everything that's happening.
[40:32.120 --> 40:34.120]  Hello, Alex. Good to be back.
[40:34.120 --> 40:36.120]  Good to have you with us.
[40:36.120 --> 40:41.120]  Yeah, basically the events that we've seen unfolding Britain over the past few days
[40:41.120 --> 40:47.120]  have come in the context of what certainly the British media have reported
[40:47.120 --> 40:50.120]  as potentially Blair's Watergate.
[40:50.120 --> 40:55.120]  And it's the scandal which revolves around Blair's re-election campaign.
[40:55.120 --> 40:59.120]  He's going to be interviewed by police again today, but go ahead.
[40:59.120 --> 41:07.120]  Yeah, because his re-election campaign in 2005 was financed by the secret loans
[41:07.120 --> 41:12.120]  which are linked to Ty Coons, big business people,
[41:12.120 --> 41:17.120]  who subsequently received peerages, which is against the law in this country.
[41:17.120 --> 41:22.120]  Now, let's be clear, they got sirs, they got knighthoods, they got lordships.
[41:22.120 --> 41:28.120]  Yes, it's basically a way to grease up the ladder into the higher echelons of the elite
[41:28.120 --> 41:30.120]  and receive one of these peerages.
[41:30.120 --> 41:37.120]  And in recent weeks, four top Blair aides including his chief fundraiser,
[41:37.120 --> 41:41.120]  his envoy to the Middle East and his director of government relations
[41:41.120 --> 41:49.120]  have all been arrested and questioned by police as part of this probe and Blair.
[41:49.120 --> 41:53.120]  But that's back of the paper now because we got bird flu, we got bombs,
[41:53.120 --> 41:57.120]  we got fake beheading plots and even a police chief saying it now.
[41:57.120 --> 42:02.120]  That's correct. As of two hours ago, if you look on the BBC website,
[42:02.120 --> 42:06.120]  you'll see stories about bird flu beheadings and letter bombs,
[42:06.120 --> 42:10.120]  but you will not see one story about this scandal,
[42:10.120 --> 42:18.120]  which on Thursday morning dominated the headlines until later on on Thursday morning
[42:18.120 --> 42:23.120]  when this lauded beheading story was foisted upon us.
[42:23.120 --> 42:28.120]  And the background of this all is that only 20% of the British public
[42:28.120 --> 42:32.120]  believe anything that Blair says about terror, is there?
[42:32.120 --> 42:36.120]  Paul, you're in the UK for those who don't know about the beheading plot.
[42:36.120 --> 42:38.120]  Tell folks about that.
[42:38.120 --> 42:41.120]  Well, it matches with some of the previous examples
[42:41.120 --> 42:49.120]  because the beheading plot revolved around a plot by so-called al-Qaeda members
[42:49.120 --> 42:54.120]  and this was supposedly ordered from al-Qaeda in Pakistan
[42:54.120 --> 42:59.120]  to kidnap a British Muslim who had served in Iraq,
[42:59.120 --> 43:05.120]  carry out a beheading in the style of the Nick Berg beheading film it
[43:05.120 --> 43:09.120]  and put it on the internet, et cetera, et cetera.
[43:09.120 --> 43:14.120]  It's been known to the UK government, you know, if it's genuine,
[43:14.120 --> 43:17.120]  which most of these plots turn out to be the complete opposite.
[43:17.120 --> 43:20.120]  Most all the fake riots in the fake stuff in Miami,
[43:20.120 --> 43:25.120]  the fake stuff in Toronto and Canada,
[43:25.120 --> 43:29.120]  I mean, they're always busting people in two days, a week later, a month later,
[43:29.120 --> 43:32.120]  usually in two or three days, it turns out it was totally fake.
[43:32.120 --> 43:35.120]  Right, and that's why only 20% believe Blair
[43:35.120 --> 43:39.120]  because you had this transatlantic bomb plot back in August
[43:39.120 --> 43:44.120]  where the lead suspects did not have plane tickets, did not have passports.
[43:44.120 --> 43:49.120]  One of the suspects was buying cakes, bulk order cakes.
[43:49.120 --> 43:54.120]  There is confectionary business at 3am hours before the supposed plot was spoiled.
[43:54.120 --> 43:59.120]  The mastermind, the ringleader of the plot, was found innocent
[43:59.120 --> 44:02.120]  on all charges of terrorism in Pakistan
[44:02.120 --> 44:08.120]  and later charged on a minor forgery offence and subsequently released.
[44:08.120 --> 44:13.120]  This was the ringleader of the alleged plot and yet, you know, Blair still talks about it
[44:13.120 --> 44:16.120]  and Bush cited it in his State of the Union speech.
[44:16.120 --> 44:20.120]  So with the beheading plot, the government's known about it for six months
[44:20.120 --> 44:25.120]  and whether it turns out to be a genuine actionable plot
[44:25.120 --> 44:27.120]  that was ever intended to be carried out.
[44:27.120 --> 44:32.120]  The fact is that when the police started making the arrests on Thursday morning,
[44:32.120 --> 44:36.120]  there were suspects which they wanted to arrest which were still at large.
[44:36.120 --> 44:40.120]  So by leaking this information to the media,
[44:40.120 --> 44:45.120]  precise details of the alleged plot, the government was in effect tipping off the terrorists
[44:45.120 --> 44:47.120]  before the police could get to them.
[44:47.120 --> 44:55.120]  And you mentioned that Daily Mail report which quoted the senior policeman
[44:55.120 --> 44:58.120]  leading the investigation into the beheading
[44:58.120 --> 45:04.120]  who was quote seething that the inquiry had been hijacked by the government,
[45:04.120 --> 45:07.120]  and this is the words of the newspaper,
[45:07.120 --> 45:13.120]  in an apparent attempt to divert attention from the problems engulfing Tony Blair.
[45:13.120 --> 45:18.120]  So there you have the police chief's furious that an operation they still wanted to keep secret
[45:18.120 --> 45:22.120]  because they were still looking for the suspects was hijacked by the government
[45:22.120 --> 45:26.120]  and used to distract people from Blair's political troubles.
[45:26.120 --> 45:32.120]  So in that instance, using the fear of terror to advance the political agenda,
[45:32.120 --> 45:35.120]  which is the very definition of terrorism
[45:35.120 --> 45:38.120]  and the Blair government is openly engaging in it.
[45:38.120 --> 45:40.120]  Yeah, let's not glaze over that key statement.
[45:40.120 --> 45:44.120]  If you go to the Encyclopedia Britannica, there's like seven different definitions,
[45:44.120 --> 45:47.120]  but the classical definition, give folks the basic definition.
[45:47.120 --> 45:52.120]  It's using the threat of terrorism, not the action itself,
[45:52.120 --> 45:57.120]  because as we know since the 1960s, and the LA Times picked up on this last week,
[45:57.120 --> 46:04.120]  since the 1960s, more Americans, and you can apply the figures across the pond,
[46:04.120 --> 46:08.120]  have been killed by accident-causing deer,
[46:08.120 --> 46:14.120]  peanut allergies, and lightning strikes than terrorism,
[46:14.120 --> 46:21.120]  because the only way in which terrorism works is if you lend credence to the fear that it might happen,
[46:21.120 --> 46:23.120]  not the actual event itself.
[46:23.120 --> 46:25.120]  Well, here's an example.
[46:25.120 --> 46:29.120]  In the 70s, there were hundreds of bombings carried out by local communists,
[46:29.120 --> 46:31.120]  the weathermen and others, and the media.
[46:31.120 --> 46:36.120]  That was real terrorism, so the federal government and the media kept it completely quiet.
[46:36.120 --> 46:39.120]  You don't give terrorism attention, that gives them what they want.
[46:39.120 --> 46:43.120]  Now, it's the same thing that we see today.
[46:43.120 --> 46:46.120]  What, a month and a half ago, giant bomb goes off,
[46:46.120 --> 46:50.120]  kills a bunch of people at the Madrid airport because it was the Basque,
[46:50.120 --> 46:53.120]  it was real, no one even knows about it.
[46:53.120 --> 46:58.120]  And there have been real terror attacks, folks, and that's why FBI and others will tell you,
[46:58.120 --> 47:01.120]  oh, there's been hundreds of attacks in the West, but they're real,
[47:01.120 --> 47:03.120]  so they're not allowed to talk about it.
[47:03.120 --> 47:09.120]  Only when it's government-sponsored, or provocative for a reason,
[47:09.120 --> 47:11.120]  do you then hear the hype and pheromongering.
[47:11.120 --> 47:17.120]  And only if they can pigeonhole it into the required groups,
[47:17.120 --> 47:20.120]  which they're currently demonizing, who are the Muslim radicals.
[47:20.120 --> 47:26.120]  But the fact is terrorism can never cripple a country's infrastructure or economy.
[47:26.120 --> 47:29.120]  They're only given power through using the threat of terror.
[47:29.120 --> 47:31.120]  Oh, easy hysteria, absolutely.
[47:31.120 --> 47:33.120]  How's psychological warfare?
[47:33.120 --> 47:37.120]  And how did the British government characterize this latest plot
[47:37.120 --> 47:41.120]  to behead this Muslim soldier as psychological warfare?
[47:41.120 --> 47:43.120]  That was the direct quote.
[47:43.120 --> 47:47.120]  But it's the government who's engaging in that psychological warfare
[47:47.120 --> 47:51.120]  because they're the ones who leaked it to the media after sitting on it for six months.
[47:51.120 --> 47:55.120]  Well, we've seen this about 50 times just in the UK in the last few years.
[47:55.120 --> 47:57.120]  We've also seen it in New York, New Jersey.
[47:57.120 --> 48:00.120]  Every time one of these groups does actually get busted,
[48:00.120 --> 48:03.120]  it turns out the leaders, MI6, CIA, or Mossad,
[48:03.120 --> 48:06.120]  that they were provocaturing street people or mentally retarded people
[48:06.120 --> 48:10.120]  or mental patients who always are on welfare with a local mental institution
[48:10.120 --> 48:13.120]  who were schizophrenics, who had no weapons, had no bombs.
[48:13.120 --> 48:16.120]  They just fund them for a year and finally get them to shoot their mouth off.
[48:16.120 --> 48:21.120]  But every time good compartments of the security apparatus,
[48:21.120 --> 48:24.120]  the police are about to bust because they think it's real
[48:24.120 --> 48:28.120]  because they pick up the chatter, the higher-ups swoop in and blow the investigation
[48:28.120 --> 48:31.120]  and then just announce that they foiled something.
[48:31.120 --> 48:38.120]  Right. So if it's a real plot, which we're not saying that there's never been a real terrorist plot,
[48:38.120 --> 48:42.120]  obviously there are Muslim radicals that want to do some damage.
[48:42.120 --> 48:48.120]  But in every major case that's been flaunted in front of our faces, it's been a scam.
[48:48.120 --> 48:54.120]  And it's interesting that Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation London Times
[48:54.120 --> 48:59.120]  reported in the same breath as they were talking about the beheading plot,
[48:59.120 --> 49:05.120]  intricate details of Al Qaeda's next plot, which hadn't been,
[49:05.120 --> 49:08.120]  whether it had been infiltrated or not, it was not reported,
[49:08.120 --> 49:10.120]  but obviously it hasn't happened yet.
[49:10.120 --> 49:13.120]  But they were saying that there are two Al Qaeda cells
[49:13.120 --> 49:16.120]  which are planning to carry out these operations
[49:16.120 --> 49:19.120]  and then gave precise details of what they were planning to do.
[49:19.120 --> 49:25.120]  So immediately, if it's a real plot and the security services have moles within those groups
[49:25.120 --> 49:29.120]  and have infiltrated them, then that's just blown their cover wide open,
[49:29.120 --> 49:32.120]  which tells you only one thing, that it's not a real plot.
[49:32.120 --> 49:34.120]  It's propaganda that they're just repeating.
[49:34.120 --> 49:36.120]  Absolutely. Shifting years.
[49:36.120 --> 49:39.120]  We now have a letter bomb exploding at the sea change HQ.
[49:39.120 --> 49:43.120]  Then we have bird flu. This is huge, breaking out of the turkey farm.
[49:43.120 --> 49:48.120]  And you have, of course, a drill at the exact same area at the exact same time.
[49:48.120 --> 49:50.120]  I mean, this is getting too obvious, Paul.
[49:50.120 --> 49:52.120]  What do you want to jump into first?
[49:52.120 --> 49:55.120]  The letter bomb or the bird flu hysteria?
[49:55.120 --> 49:58.120]  All this happening as Blair is about to be indicted.
[49:58.120 --> 50:02.120]  Right. Let's go for the bird flu because that came out.
[50:02.120 --> 50:05.120]  As soon as the beheading story started to die down,
[50:05.120 --> 50:09.120]  Saturday morning afternoon we had this bird flu story come out.
[50:09.120 --> 50:15.120]  An outbreak on a poultry farm in East Anglia, which is, you know,
[50:15.120 --> 50:17.120]  East Britain, East England.
[50:17.120 --> 50:23.120]  And as you mentioned, observers of these kind of things will find it interesting to know
[50:23.120 --> 50:29.120]  that an April 2006 bird flu drill that was run by Downing Street,
[50:29.120 --> 50:33.120]  the Ministry of Defence and other British government agencies
[50:33.120 --> 50:40.120]  revolved around the scenario of a bird flu outbreak on a poultry farm in Newcastle, East Anglia,
[50:40.120 --> 50:42.120]  the exact same place.
[50:42.120 --> 50:48.120]  And it comes to my attention, Finn, that the government is engaged in a bird flu drill at this very moment.
[50:48.120 --> 50:53.120]  That's right. They were engaged in a drill before at the same spot and a new one.
[50:53.120 --> 50:55.120]  Well, explain why they do that.
[50:55.120 --> 50:58.120]  They were behind the foot and mouth. That was confirmed.
[50:58.120 --> 51:00.120]  Then they killed the head of the operation,
[51:00.120 --> 51:03.120]  a Dr. David Kelly when he started opening his mouth about it.
[51:03.120 --> 51:05.120]  Paul Watson's our guest. Stay with us.
[51:10.120 --> 51:14.120]  It's here after a year in production and traveling the distant lands.
[51:14.120 --> 51:16.120]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[51:16.120 --> 51:21.120]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks
[51:21.120 --> 51:24.120]  against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[51:24.120 --> 51:28.120]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job,
[51:28.120 --> 51:32.120]  but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[51:32.120 --> 51:35.120]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran,
[51:35.120 --> 51:41.120]  a White House frozen to disseminate fake news, NSA spy, secret police torture,
[51:41.120 --> 51:44.120]  the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[51:44.120 --> 51:48.120]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorists.
[51:48.120 --> 51:50.120]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[51:50.120 --> 51:54.120]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[54:07.120 --> 54:13.120]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show,
[54:13.120 --> 54:16.120]  because there's a war on for your mind.
[54:16.120 --> 54:19.120]  We're going to keep Paul just a little bit into the next hour,
[54:19.120 --> 54:21.120]  so he has a chance to finish this.
[54:21.120 --> 54:26.120]  He already went over one point, the latest fake beheading hysteria.
[54:26.120 --> 54:28.120]  Now, in our bird flu.
[54:28.120 --> 54:31.120]  Paul, I think it's important, as you did do in the great article you wrote,
[54:31.120 --> 54:34.120]  that everybody should get from presentplanet.com,
[54:34.120 --> 54:37.120]  that the government's done this type of stuff before.
[54:37.120 --> 54:42.120]  It was a level four bio weapons lab at Porton Down, run by Dr. David Kelly,
[54:42.120 --> 54:47.120]  where magically they said the weaponized foot and mouth was released.
[54:47.120 --> 54:53.120]  They then killed eight million sheep, what, three million cows, that didn't even have it.
[54:53.120 --> 54:57.120]  They used it to set, and then of course the environment minister came out and said,
[54:57.120 --> 54:59.120]  we're not going to allow restocking of cows and sheep.
[54:59.120 --> 55:02.120]  They hurt the environment with their flatulence, the global warming.
[55:02.120 --> 55:05.120]  More baloney, I want to drive the farmers off their land.
[55:05.120 --> 55:10.120]  And then you have a drill on top of this. Please continue.
[55:10.120 --> 55:11.120]  Well, that's right.
[55:11.120 --> 55:19.120]  I mean, the biggest anti-black political bloc in Britain is not the anti-war crowd.
[55:19.120 --> 55:21.120]  It's the farming community.
[55:21.120 --> 55:34.120]  You had 400,000 protesters marching London in 2002 against a variety of issues that had been passed
[55:34.120 --> 55:38.120]  under the Blair administration that directly impacted farmers.
[55:38.120 --> 55:43.120]  And if you're going to see a bird flu outbreak that spreads into hysteria,
[55:43.120 --> 55:51.120]  then expect to see it in Britain because the Blair government are past masters at agro-terrorism,
[55:51.120 --> 55:59.120]  agricultural terrorism, which is proven by, as you mentioned, the foot and mouth outbreak of 2001,
[55:59.120 --> 56:06.120]  where we're supposed to believe this fairy tale that the virus was stolen from port and down
[56:06.120 --> 56:11.120]  by a weapons facility by animal rights campaigns.
[56:11.120 --> 56:18.120]  It has two 20-foot bar bar fences with landmines, machine gun nests, and biometric stand to get in.
[56:18.120 --> 56:24.120]  Right. It's staffed by armed guards. You know, it houses anthrax and Ebola.
[56:24.120 --> 56:30.120]  There are signs they have these here in the U.S. If you approach the fence and don't turn back, they shoot you.
[56:30.120 --> 56:40.120]  Right. And it was supposedly led to believe it was released by animal rights activists when it killed 4 million animals.
[56:40.120 --> 56:45.120]  And there were researchers at the time that noted that...
[56:45.120 --> 56:52.120]  Let me go back. Am I wrong? I was going for memory. It was 8 million sheep and 3 million cows that killed.
[56:52.120 --> 56:56.120]  I had it at 4 million, but that's probably the minimum.
[56:56.120 --> 56:59.120]  Well, that's memory from 2001. I've got to check that now.
[56:59.120 --> 57:04.120]  They were running exercises at the exact same time.
[57:04.120 --> 57:10.120]  That's right. It came out then, and then this is BBC, this is London Telegraph, London Independent, because I'm going to read the articles on air,
[57:10.120 --> 57:16.120]  and Mark Paul has written a new one with links to these original stories where it says they were running a drill
[57:16.120 --> 57:21.120]  a foot and mouth right when it started in the exact three spots in the north, east, and south.
[57:21.120 --> 57:28.120]  And it gets worse. They were busy buying up all the stockwood to burn the cows in the month before and creep it up.
[57:28.120 --> 57:30.120]  Paul, go through it.
[57:30.120 --> 57:36.120]  Right. The government was making inquiries to timber merchants and sign makers.
[57:36.120 --> 57:45.120]  Because I remember clearly in 2001, if you want... I mean, I live basically on the hills next to the blast countryside.
[57:45.120 --> 57:50.120]  If you wanted to go for a walk anywhere in the countryside in those months, you couldn't do it,
[57:50.120 --> 57:55.120]  because there were signs everywhere saying foot and mouth restricted area, keep out.
[57:55.120 --> 58:01.120]  And the government had made inquiries to get to timber merchants and sign makers to get those signs drawn up,
[58:01.120 --> 58:07.120]  which closed public footpath before the outbreak that even happened.
[58:07.120 --> 58:11.120]  That's right. You live in the north. You live in the north where it really broke out.
[58:11.120 --> 58:21.120]  Yeah. And the whole year was characterized by these apocalyptic images of burning pyres with, you know, cows and sheep.
[58:21.120 --> 58:23.120]  Stay there.
[58:23.120 --> 58:26.120]  Go ahead.
[58:26.120 --> 58:31.120]  Well, let's finish up with the bird flu. Then let's get into the latest bomb that went off.
[58:31.120 --> 58:35.120]  And talk about the cop of trouble players and we'll let you get out of here then, Paul.
[58:35.120 --> 58:37.120]  Another 10, 15 minutes or so.
[58:37.120 --> 58:41.120]  Paul Watson of PrismPlanet.com and PrismPlanet.tv.
[58:41.120 --> 58:47.120]  His brother operates Infowars.net.

[58:57.120 --> 59:00.120]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[59:00.120 --> 59:05.120]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[59:05.120 --> 59:10.120]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed through the skin.
[59:10.120 --> 59:19.120]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury and iron and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus in your shower.
[59:19.120 --> 59:23.120]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound and is recyclable.
[59:23.120 --> 59:28.120]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[59:28.120 --> 59:35.120]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[59:35.120 --> 59:37.120]  What about you?
[59:37.120 --> 59:45.120]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for a special price of only $35, of $14 savings.

[1:00:43.120 --> 1:00:45.120]  Well, so does he.
[1:00:45.120 --> 1:00:49.120]  Today's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:00:49.120 --> 1:00:54.120]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:54.120 --> 1:01:01.120]  Coming up, a giant government hoax claiming it's the law that you've got to take a live cancer virus.
[1:01:01.120 --> 1:01:04.120]  Big War drums on Iran.
[1:01:04.120 --> 1:01:08.120]  It's a total replay of 2003 with the Iraq attack.
[1:01:08.120 --> 1:01:11.120]  The biggest federal budget ever, dwarfing Bush's previous budgets.
[1:01:11.120 --> 1:01:15.120]  They're going to have the IRS crack down on people.
[1:01:15.120 --> 1:01:16.120]  Huge second and third hour.
[1:01:16.120 --> 1:01:18.120]  Paul Watson will be with us about another 15 minutes.
[1:01:18.120 --> 1:01:22.120]  And we're going to have open phones today at 1-800-2599-211.
[1:01:22.120 --> 1:01:30.120]  For those that just joined us, even a police chief, headline police chief, the heading plot being used as a distraction from Blair Wows.
[1:01:30.120 --> 1:01:36.120]  Blair has many members of his administration have now been arrested, involved in criminal activities in the 2005 election.
[1:01:36.120 --> 1:01:39.120]  He's being questioned by police right now.
[1:01:39.120 --> 1:01:42.120]  He's scheduled for this afternoon. It is afternoon there now.
[1:01:42.120 --> 1:01:44.120]  Really evening.
[1:01:44.120 --> 1:01:47.120]  Letter bomb explodes at C-Charge HQ.
[1:01:47.120 --> 1:01:54.120]  And clearly the government was running a drill last year and this week when bird flu broke out in England.
[1:01:54.120 --> 1:02:00.120]  Paul, explain to people why they run drills at the exact same time, at the exact same places.
[1:02:00.120 --> 1:02:13.120]  They run drills at the same time and at the same places to shield themselves from allegations of complicity if such evidence is released at a later date.
[1:02:13.120 --> 1:02:19.120]  So they can say now that we weren't involved, it was just part of the drill. It was an exercise.
[1:02:19.120 --> 1:02:21.120]  So it's the kind of cover for them.
[1:02:21.120 --> 1:02:26.120]  They also bootleg the funding 7-7-9-11 Madrid.
[1:02:26.120 --> 1:02:32.120]  They also bootleg the funding for the attacks through the funding of the drill.
[1:02:32.120 --> 1:02:42.120]  Yeah, it serves numerous purposes, but in every major terrorist attack, you will see that it is paralleled, it's dovetailed by a drill.
[1:02:42.120 --> 1:02:53.120]  So that's why now there's whole websites devoted to drills in all different areas of the US and Britain just to track and keep an eye on what's going to happen.
[1:02:53.120 --> 1:02:57.120]  To try and preempt another disaster happening.
[1:02:57.120 --> 1:03:00.120]  Daniel Abram sent a false flag news.
[1:03:00.120 --> 1:03:01.120]  That's right, yeah.
[1:03:01.120 --> 1:03:04.120]  Right here on the Genesis Network now.
[1:03:04.120 --> 1:03:09.120]  Any other facets we need to talk about concerning the bird flu?
[1:03:09.120 --> 1:03:20.120]  No, I think that at the moment it's confined to one farm, but they set up the exclusion zone for like 20 miles around where you can't even get near the area.
[1:03:20.120 --> 1:03:28.120]  An introduction to feudalism and the counter control measures that they've got in line for us, you know, when it really goes down.
[1:03:28.120 --> 1:03:35.120]  The control grid, and they've also doing other drills in other parts of the country. Let's see if it pops up there.
[1:03:35.120 --> 1:03:47.120]  Right, in that drill that I mentioned from April 2006, it was also in southern England and Scotland, so if it pops up there, then we'll have a really big story.
[1:03:47.120 --> 1:04:03.120]  But it was followed today by the news, which is probably also, you know, gleefully welcomed by Blair's spin masters of this letter bomb attack and an office building in London, which injured one female employee,
[1:04:03.120 --> 1:04:14.120]  which again coincidentally targeted the company that handles London's big brother license plate scanning congestion scheme.
[1:04:14.120 --> 1:04:27.120]  So, you know, in the aftermath of the government's privacy commissioners saying Britain was a surveillance state and all this pressure to introduce this tracking taxation scheme to help fight global warming,
[1:04:27.120 --> 1:04:33.120]  you know, some evil extremist has attacked, you know, the big brother overlord that would manage it.
[1:04:33.120 --> 1:04:42.120]  So it'd be interesting to see if they identify the individual behind that and if they use it as a demonization tool.
[1:04:42.120 --> 1:04:52.120]  How many years have I said that they will attack their own big brother facilities in the future and then equate any protest of big brother as working with terrorists?
[1:04:52.120 --> 1:05:00.120]  Right, exactly. Because with the ID cards that go in effect, there's increasing vocal opposition against it.
[1:05:00.120 --> 1:05:09.120]  And there will be lots of terror blamed on groups that are against it. This has been predicted by myself for 10 years. Not hard to do. We know the enemy's MO.
[1:05:09.120 --> 1:05:15.120]  Let's talk about the charges Blair's under right now. Will he be going down? Will it even matter? It's like shark teeth.
[1:05:15.120 --> 1:05:20.120]  They've got more, you know, nastier individuals behind him. He's nothing but a puppet.
[1:05:20.120 --> 1:05:24.120]  Briefly talk about who the real ruling class of England is and then conclude with Paul Watson.
[1:05:24.120 --> 1:05:32.120]  Go to your calls and cover the news from across the planet to right here in Texas. We'll be right back.
[1:05:32.120 --> 1:05:41.120]  It's here after a year in production and traveling the distant lands, widely filmed terror storm is complete.
[1:05:41.120 --> 1:05:49.120]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[1:05:49.120 --> 1:05:57.120]  Terror storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[1:05:57.120 --> 1:06:09.120]  Terror storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spy, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[1:06:09.120 --> 1:06:15.120]  Terror storm is the definitive guide to the history of government sponsored terrorists. It's an anthology of government crimes.
[1:06:15.120 --> 1:06:19.120]  Terror storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[1:06:33.120 --> 1:06:41.120]  Good morning, honey. Wow, the weather is beautiful, the cabin is terrific, and it's the first day of our vacation.
[1:06:41.120 --> 1:06:42.120]  Yeah.
[1:06:42.120 --> 1:06:44.120]  Honey, is there something wrong?
[1:06:44.120 --> 1:06:54.120]  Yeah, I just realized we forgot to pack the travel-burky system. I can't drink this cabin water, and what am I going to do when I'm out on the lake? Now the whole vacation is ruined.
[1:06:54.120 --> 1:06:58.120]  Honey, cheer up. I brought our sport-burky purifiers.
[1:06:58.120 --> 1:06:59.120]  What?
[1:06:59.120 --> 1:07:09.120]  Yeah, I know you're picky about not having pathogenic bacteria, organic chemicals, heavy metals or foul tastes, and odors in the water, so I packed our sport-burky purifiers.
[1:07:09.120 --> 1:07:14.120]  You know, this is a terrific cabin, and wow, how do you notice the beautiful weather?

[1:07:32.120 --> 1:07:40.120]  I found this company online, and they had this really unique variety of salt wellness products. I read some of the articles and ended up ordering this beautiful salt lamp.
[1:07:40.120 --> 1:07:51.120]  According to the company, they said that the salt crystal lamps gently purify indoor air. I was so amazed. I put it in the baby's room, and it made a perfect night light. Both my husband and I could tell the difference.
[1:07:51.120 --> 1:07:57.120]  Solay Wellness.com is a unique company that offers salt wellness products from around the world.
[1:07:57.120 --> 1:08:05.120]  So, I went back to the site and ordered their Solay Simple Natural Cleaning Products, also made with Himalayan salt. I figured it would clean really well.
[1:08:05.120 --> 1:08:14.120]  The natural cleaning products worked wonderfully, and there was no scent. This company has so many products my whole family can enjoy and feel better with. Plus, the service was great.

[1:09:15.120 --> 1:09:29.120]  Welcome back. We're going to go to your call here in just a moment. Wellington, Joe, Paula, Gale, Dino, and many others.
[1:09:29.120 --> 1:09:49.120]  Going back to Paul Watson. Now, all of this happening, again, Blair and all this trouble, members of his campaign being arrested, all this criminality coming out, and then suddenly a bomb goes off, suddenly bird flu pops up, coinciding with the drill, the exact same time, the same area.
[1:09:49.120 --> 1:10:04.120]  We have the heading coming out that the police chief says is for nothing but political purposes. What is Blair facing? Does it even matter? How will it tie in to an upcoming war against Iran, Paul Watson?
[1:10:04.120 --> 1:10:23.120]  Well, it ties in to Iran because, as I said before, the British government have passed masters of terrorism, which they honed by infiltrating the IRA in the 80s and using the IRA to carry out bombings in the 80s and 90s,
[1:10:23.120 --> 1:10:49.120]  via the force research unit, which we're told is now in Iraq, helping the insurgents. And there's all this talk about Iran providing the Iraqi insurgents with the IEDs, improvised explosive devices, when in fact it's known that it was the IRA that sold those devices around the world in the late 80s and 90s.
[1:10:49.120 --> 1:11:03.120]  And then it's known that the IRA was really run by British intelligence in my five, in my six army commandos. We've had them here on air. Now, the majority of the British people and the Irish people know that it's an inside job as a pretext for military occupation and control.
[1:11:03.120 --> 1:11:17.120]  I'm setting up the surveillance grid. But that's big news. Mainstream news, now reporting, I have it here in front of me. Go over that, Paul, of the secret British commandos actually, quote, training the insurgency.
[1:11:17.120 --> 1:11:27.120]  Last year, as the former chief CIA analyst for Ronald Reagan and George Bush senior, Ray McGovern said clearly that mosque last year got blown up to kick off and expand sectarian violence.
[1:11:27.120 --> 1:11:38.120]  And MI6 soldiers, when I say MI6, that is, they attach under MI6 control special air services caught dressed up like Arabs staging terror attacks.
[1:11:38.120 --> 1:12:00.120]  Right. And now the FRU is in there providing bombs to insurgents and Al Qaeda in Iraq, or whatever you want to call it, and helping them continue the cycle of chaos, which was planned all along from the Israeli strategy documents and others that wanted to have strife and break Iraq up into sectarian violence,
[1:12:00.120 --> 1:12:18.120]  which was proven, as you mentioned, by the Samara mosque bombing, where you had Iraqi National Guard accompanied by US troops go in there and gag the mosque guards, kidnap them, then according to eyewitnesses.
[1:12:18.120 --> 1:12:22.120]  This is in the middle of a major city. Thousands of people saw this.
[1:12:22.120 --> 1:12:32.120]  Yeah, according to the eyewitnesses, plenty explosives. The inhabitants were told to stay in their homes until six a.m. the next morning, and then it blew.
[1:12:32.120 --> 1:12:38.120]  And that was the catalyst for what is now termed by most people to be the Civil War.
[1:12:38.120 --> 1:12:54.120]  And let's be clear. There was around the mosque armored pickets. The roads were shut down. The US controlled all the roads there in the center of the city. They opened it up, whiten in, leading Iraqi National Guard.
[1:12:54.120 --> 1:13:01.120]  Over a hundred of them go right in. They spend hours planting bombs. They leave and the thing blows sky high.
[1:13:01.120 --> 1:13:11.120]  Right. And it didn't kill anyone. But it was a symbol for the chaos and it started the Civil War.
[1:13:11.120 --> 1:13:18.120]  If it was, you know, Al Qaeda in Iraq, they would have wanted mass casualties, but they waited until no one was in there and then blew it.
[1:13:18.120 --> 1:13:26.120]  And it became a symbol of the Civil War and it was carried out by the Iraqi National Guard accompanied by US troops, that's according to eyewitnesses.
[1:13:26.120 --> 1:13:32.120]  So the British have passed math, they've had it, and now they've gone into Iraq with the FRU.
[1:13:32.120 --> 1:13:37.120]  And from that, it's only going to continue if you're only going to see more violence.
[1:13:37.120 --> 1:13:49.120]  Going back to Blair, basically it looks to me as if it's face saving because it doesn't really matter if he goes now or if he goes in September when he said he would resign.
[1:13:49.120 --> 1:14:03.120]  Because waiting in line to take over is his Bilderberg sidekick, Gordon Brown, who has been through all the same Bilderberg meetings, has already been selected as the next prime minister.
[1:14:03.120 --> 1:14:10.120]  They have to have a leadership race, the Labour Party, to choose the next prime minister.
[1:14:10.120 --> 1:14:22.120]  And included in that leadership race will be Michael Meacher, the former environment minister and vocal skeptic of the official story behind 9-11.
[1:14:22.120 --> 1:14:32.120]  Now hopefully he can use his platform to get attention to serious issues, but they've already chosen Mr Bilderberg, Gordon Brown as Blair's replacement.
[1:14:32.120 --> 1:14:43.120]  But in the sense of wiping this scandal off the front pages in the space of four days, these three separate incidents have done exactly that for the British government.
[1:14:43.120 --> 1:14:49.120]  And each time one falls through, they just pull another rabbit out of a hat.
[1:14:49.120 --> 1:14:59.120]  That's right. And whether Blair goes now or in September doesn't really matter because to a large extent he succeeded at what he was putting to do.
[1:14:59.120 --> 1:15:09.120]  He's failed in a certain sense in getting the country subjugated more into the European Union by failing to get the EU constitution passed.
[1:15:09.120 --> 1:15:19.120]  But he's certainly destroyed Britain in terms of, you know, it's a crime to protest now under the Serious and Organised Crimes Act.
[1:15:19.120 --> 1:15:23.120]  You stage a protest, you get arrested because it's a criminal offense.
[1:15:23.120 --> 1:15:36.120]  We've got shouting telly screens on the streets. We've got x-ray scanners that are about to be put in light poles in London as a test which will eventually be expanded nationwide.
[1:15:36.120 --> 1:15:47.120]  So as far as the drift towards authoritarianism across the Western world, that's the 9-11, Blair has done exactly what he set out to do.
[1:15:47.120 --> 1:15:58.120]  And another thing that I find interesting is that, as I just mentioned the surveillance cameras, I read this thing on Thursday.
[1:15:58.120 --> 1:16:06.120]  Communist China in Beijing which has 15 million inhabitants compared to London 7.5 million.
[1:16:06.120 --> 1:16:16.120]  Beijing has won 16th the amount of cameras, surveillance cameras, as London. London has 15 times more surveillance cameras.
[1:16:16.120 --> 1:16:19.120]  London has 4.5 million last time I checked.
[1:16:19.120 --> 1:16:28.120]  Right, and even in communist police state Beijing, they're getting rid of the surveillance cameras because they say they don't solve crimes.
[1:16:28.120 --> 1:16:33.120]  Yeah, I saw stories last year where the Chinese are protesting saying it's Big Brother.
[1:16:33.120 --> 1:16:51.120]  Yeah, and the government's being forced to pull them out because they admit they don't solve any crimes. And you've got 16 times the amount in London which is half the size of Beijing so that shows just how enslaved Britons are in 2007 and Tony Blair.
[1:16:51.120 --> 1:16:59.120]  Well, I mean microphones have been going up in Austin with the cameras since 98, source Austin American statesman, federal grant.
[1:16:59.120 --> 1:17:09.120]  I guess in the U.K. and the U.S. we think we're free so they say protesting banned. Free speech zones. We'll arrest you. We wear black masks now.
[1:17:09.120 --> 1:17:14.120]  I mean this is not freedom folks and I just can't believe it's gone this far, Paul.
[1:17:14.120 --> 1:17:33.120]  Well, it's amazing that there was a woman reading the independent newspaper in London sat on a bench and the newspaper had a headline which would be viewed as anti-war and she was arrested for reading the newspaper with an anti-war headline, a mainstream newspaper.
[1:17:33.120 --> 1:17:42.120]  By the way, that was in the BBC. That was all over the news. It was just a mainstream newspaper. She's sitting there reading it and they said, no, that's a protest. You are arrested.
[1:17:42.120 --> 1:17:47.120]  Right because it was classified as a protest which is now illegal.
[1:17:47.120 --> 1:17:55.120]  Again, and we have a governor here on the payroll of Merck saying you will take the vaccines. I don't care if the legislature won't pass a law.
[1:17:55.120 --> 1:18:07.120]  You will take a live virus connected to just unbelievable bad effects, death, seizures, blood pouring out of every orifice, accelerated autoimmune death and it's just, oh, we don't care.
[1:18:07.120 --> 1:18:15.120]  We don't care if you don't want the toll roads. We don't care if you don't want North American Union. We don't care if you don't want amnesty.
[1:18:15.120 --> 1:18:24.120]  We're just going to do it. Paul Watson, what's new coming up at PrisonPlanet.com. I know you're doing a story on Perry and the vaccine.
[1:18:24.120 --> 1:18:38.120]  My brother is doing a story right now on this force research unit, the group that helped the IRA carry out bombings which are now doing the same in Iraq so that's coming out today.
[1:18:38.120 --> 1:18:46.120]  Paul, it's getting so obvious. They don't even deny it now. It's like an open secret that the government's behind almost all the terror.
[1:18:46.120 --> 1:19:01.120]  Right, I mean that's bubbling under the surface and then you've got the made-for-TV movie of events where Bush is really trying to protect America while prosecuting border agents that shoot drug smugglers.
[1:19:01.120 --> 1:19:16.120]  I mean that's got to have woken a lot of conservatives up that previously were still in line with Bush so as the actions get more outrageous, there'll be more outrage which can only help our cause.
[1:19:16.120 --> 1:19:19.120]  Absolutely. Paul Watson, thanks for spending time with us.
[1:19:19.120 --> 1:19:33.120]  In a way, though, government is just trying to overwhelm us, trying to be in our face, just trying to say we don't care what you want, trying to break our spirit, it needs to be the opposite.
[1:19:33.120 --> 1:19:47.120]  Shoot your mouth off at church, shoot it off at work, shoot it off at college, you know, talk about it, educate people, make copies of films like Road to Terror and the Mashers of Terror, Terror Store, Marshall Law, give them to people, get aggressive.
[1:19:47.120 --> 1:19:52.120]  The population is waking up now like never before.
[1:19:52.120 --> 1:20:09.120]  The battle is joined but we have to intensify our efforts in Europe, in the U.K., in the U.S. and Canada because we are the captured engine being used to project the power of this criminal world government.
[1:20:09.120 --> 1:20:11.120]  And we're losing our freedoms as well.
[1:20:11.120 --> 1:20:13.120]  So many people think, yeah, there's an empire but I'm part of it.
[1:20:13.120 --> 1:20:16.120]  No, you're not part of it. You're a slave of it.
[1:20:16.120 --> 1:20:24.120]  They hate you if you're a cop. They hate the military. They hate your families. They hate any independence, okay? They treat you like trash.
[1:20:24.120 --> 1:20:32.120]  This is not our government. We'll go straight to your cause after this break. Stay with me.

[1:22:51.120 --> 1:22:56.120]  Citizens would be required to turn in their guns, guaranteed to them by the Second Amendment.
[1:22:56.120 --> 1:23:03.120]  The head of the United Nations forces that would control all arms would always be a communist by agreement.

[1:23:32.120 --> 1:23:36.120]  Hi, Michelle. I haven't seen you on the bus for a while. Did they change your shift?
[1:23:36.120 --> 1:23:47.120]  No, Lori. I finally quit my job. I'm working at home now, and I love it. No more commuting. And I'm home when the kids get out of school, working at home, doing what?
[1:23:47.120 --> 1:23:53.120]  It's a long story. It all started when I discovered the website, Earn Money At Home 123.com.
[1:23:53.120 --> 1:23:57.120]  Oh, Michelle, you didn't fall from one of those internet deals, did you?
[1:23:57.120 --> 1:24:07.120]  Well, I looked into several, and this one is for real. Are you sure? I didn't quit my job until I was sure, and now I'm making way more money working at home.
[1:24:07.120 --> 1:24:16.120]  Really? I joined the success team in their major advertising co-op. Our business is fully automated, which gives me more money and the time to enjoy it.
[1:24:16.120 --> 1:24:18.120]  I'll be earning money while we're skiing this winter.
[1:24:18.120 --> 1:24:20.120]  What was that website again?
[1:24:20.120 --> 1:24:29.120]  Earn Money At Home 123.com. Here, write it down. Good idea. Earn Money At Home 123.com. Maybe we can go skiing this winter, too.
[1:24:29.120 --> 1:24:54.120]  Earn Money At Home 123.com is a global opportunity.
[1:25:00.120 --> 1:25:04.120]  I knew too much.
[1:25:04.120 --> 1:25:09.120]  Welcome back. Straight to your calls, and I'm going to get more into the vaccine news.
[1:25:09.120 --> 1:25:14.120]  We're also going to break down what's happening with Iran, some good news, states revolting against the National ID card.
[1:25:14.120 --> 1:25:22.120]  Let's go ahead and go to Wellington, then Paula, Gayle, Dino, Roman, and others. Go ahead, Wellington, from Louisiana, you're on the air.
[1:25:22.120 --> 1:25:32.120]  Cuckoo. Cuckoo. Cuckoo. Cuckoo. Cuckoo. Cuckoo. Cuckoo. Cuckoo.
[1:25:32.120 --> 1:25:39.120]  You called my new syndicated show, the different four to six p.m. every Sunday afternoon.
[1:25:39.120 --> 1:25:40.120]  Cuckoo.
[1:25:40.120 --> 1:25:53.120]  And you did this for about 30 seconds, too. If I am a fruit loop, if I am a cuckoo, bird, tell me why. Give me specifics.
[1:25:53.120 --> 1:25:56.120]  Cuckoo. Cuckoo.
[1:25:56.120 --> 1:25:58.120]  So you can't do that.
[1:25:58.120 --> 1:26:01.120]  Cuckoo.
[1:26:01.120 --> 1:26:03.120]  Now, let him keep going. I want people to hear this.
[1:26:03.120 --> 1:26:06.120]  Cuckoo. Cuckoo.
[1:26:06.120 --> 1:26:25.120]  We're just going to give you the floor. Go ahead. Cuckoo. Cuckoo. Cuckoo. Cuckoo. Cuckoo.
[1:26:25.120 --> 1:26:32.120]  That's your big, intellectual argument with me. Name calling. Cuckoo.
[1:26:32.120 --> 1:26:37.120]  Because we study how the world really works and how to warn people. Cuckoo.
[1:26:37.120 --> 1:26:42.120]  All right. Well, I appreciate your call. I'll let him call a few more times doing that.
[1:26:42.120 --> 1:26:48.120]  And then when we hear Wellington from Louisiana, he will enter the rare breed of banned callers.
[1:26:48.120 --> 1:26:53.120]  There's only a few of those. A few stalkers. We've gotten a few feds we know of or banned from the show.
[1:26:53.120 --> 1:26:56.120]  Or someone who calls in doing the exact same thing every time.
[1:26:56.120 --> 1:26:59.120]  But that's twice. You can do it a few more times, Wellington.
[1:26:59.120 --> 1:27:03.120]  And then if you ever want to call them anything serious, you'll have to use a different name.
[1:27:03.120 --> 1:27:08.120]  Because the name Wellington from Louisiana will not be on the show.
[1:27:08.120 --> 1:27:15.120]  But I gave you the floor there for you to say Fruit Loop and Cuckoo over and over again.
[1:27:15.120 --> 1:27:20.120]  And I guess you think that's a real effective way to deal with our information.
[1:27:20.120 --> 1:27:23.120]  Maybe you like your dollar being devalued by half.
[1:27:23.120 --> 1:27:31.120]  And I, Sam Cuckoo, and for Cocoa Puffs, something a little more original than just Fruit Loop and Cuckoo.
[1:27:31.120 --> 1:27:39.120]  Come on. There's something else. I mean, can you put a sentence together to explain why I'm crazy?
[1:27:39.120 --> 1:27:43.120]  I mean, what is it we're saying that isn't true, Wellington?
[1:27:43.120 --> 1:27:49.120]  This is a live cancer virus. There is no law you have to take it. The governor's lying and saying there is.
[1:27:49.120 --> 1:27:55.120]  It's not a payroll of Merck. It is criminal. It is racketeering. It is what it is.
[1:27:55.120 --> 1:28:01.120]  They have been engaged in eugenics experiments and sterilization against the people of this planet for a long time.
[1:28:01.120 --> 1:28:06.120]  And I for one am sick of it. And just because you're so weak-minded and it scares you so badly,
[1:28:06.120 --> 1:28:11.120]  there's other types of stuff going on, you shouldn't just out of hand deny it.
[1:28:11.120 --> 1:28:15.120]  And for heaven's sakes, if you want to disagree with me, call in with something pertinent.
[1:28:15.120 --> 1:28:22.120]  Let's talk to Paula in Florida. Go ahead, Paula. Hi, Alex. I just got, which is newsletter.
[1:28:22.120 --> 1:28:29.120]  Anyway, I've got a call put into J. Rockefeller, and I'm going to talk to him very seriously about what's happening
[1:28:29.120 --> 1:28:38.120]  and that best gets stopped. And I just called our reps too about this immunization for this cervical cancer
[1:28:38.120 --> 1:28:44.120]  and told them we need to get this stopped and also the federal ID. And I'm doing everything I can.
[1:28:44.120 --> 1:28:50.120]  Good, Paula. Keep it up. Thanks for the call. Let's talk to Gail in Texas. Gail, go ahead.
[1:28:50.120 --> 1:28:55.120]  Thank you, Alex. Appreciate the information you've given out about the vaccine in Texas.
[1:28:55.120 --> 1:28:59.120]  I've called our state representative after what I've heard in research.
[1:28:59.120 --> 1:29:08.120]  I can say as a mother of a son with epilepsy for 22 years, if you do not have to give a child mercury, do not.
[1:29:08.120 --> 1:29:11.120]  Let me guess. When did the epilepsy start after around the shots?
[1:29:11.120 --> 1:29:15.120]  The adolescent time. That is a booster.
[1:29:15.120 --> 1:29:22.120]  In almost every case, the seizure happens in the car, home, that night, or the next morning. How long until the seizure started?
[1:29:22.120 --> 1:29:30.120]  I don't know exactly how long, but the epilepsy right now is controlled with one of the strongest medications there is,
[1:29:30.120 --> 1:29:34.120]  along with two other medications and a vagus nerve stimulator.
[1:29:34.120 --> 1:29:45.120]  Well, every form of cancer is up, and of course, autism is up. Everything is up, and it can clearly be connected to the vaccines.
[1:29:45.120 --> 1:29:51.120]  But does that stop Rick Perry from saying it's the law? No, he just makes it up and says it's the law. There is no law.
[1:29:51.120 --> 1:29:57.120]  And I've also watched my mother die of mycoplasma.
[1:29:57.120 --> 1:30:00.120]  Oh, boy. Anything else you'd like to add?
[1:30:00.120 --> 1:30:05.120]  Just tell Wellington to think about that.
[1:30:05.120 --> 1:30:10.120]  Well, Wellington is probably too stupid to even get himself a woman and have children, but if he ever does,
[1:30:10.120 --> 1:30:16.120]  I'm sure whoever he mates with will be so dumb they'll probably go ahead and shoot the kids up with 14 different shots
[1:30:16.120 --> 1:30:22.120]  and watch their eyes roll back in their head, and they'll dance around thanking the government for it.
[1:30:22.120 --> 1:30:26.120]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[1:30:26.120 --> 1:30:32.120]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:30:32.120 --> 1:30:34.120]  How are you feeling today?
[1:30:34.120 --> 1:30:41.120]  I asked because if you have health challenges, then reading our free booklet about the most amazing discovery of our time is crucial.
[1:30:41.120 --> 1:30:46.120]  The booklet is about an amazing fruit from Southeast Asia they call mango steam.

[1:31:32.120 --> 1:31:39.120]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[1:31:39.120 --> 1:31:45.120]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for big business and the American Empire instead of what's fair for the American people.
[1:31:45.120 --> 1:31:49.120]  The only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism.

[1:34:19.120 --> 1:34:31.120]  Continuing with Open Phones, I've got a local newscast concerning Wick Perry and the forced inoculations that were not, and a lot more.
[1:34:31.120 --> 1:34:38.120]  Continuing with Open Phones though, right now, Dino in Oregon, thanks for holding your on the air.
[1:34:38.120 --> 1:34:47.120]  Smart, courageous, bold, informed. Those are the words that idiots should have used on you.
[1:34:47.120 --> 1:34:51.120]  Repeat those words. Those make sense. How are you doing, Alex?
[1:34:51.120 --> 1:34:57.120]  I'm doing okay. I mean, why was he just going cuckoo, cuckoo, fruit loops, fruit loops? He did that last night.
[1:34:57.120 --> 1:35:03.120]  He's obviously curious about the truth. He is scared. He is a person who wants to know about the truth.
[1:35:03.120 --> 1:35:10.120]  So let him keep listening. He listens. He sits on hold. He obviously knows something's going on, something real.
[1:35:10.120 --> 1:35:14.120]  But why? How could you say the world is not in deep trouble?
[1:35:14.120 --> 1:35:17.120]  How could you not say that evil wasn't growing and on the march?
[1:35:17.120 --> 1:35:24.120]  How could you say that every basic foundational value of this country isn't being cut up in little pieces?
[1:35:24.120 --> 1:35:28.120]  I mean, how could you deny it? How could you call us cuckoo?
[1:35:28.120 --> 1:35:34.120]  That's okay. They've always called people like us cuckoo until the truth comes and the tide turns.
[1:35:34.120 --> 1:35:41.120]  And the tide is turning. I noticed Dan Abramson is now on Genesis Network. Thank goodness.
[1:35:41.120 --> 1:35:44.120]  Yeah, a lot of great folks here on the network.
[1:35:44.120 --> 1:35:48.120]  I also wanted to tell you that the 9-11 DVD project helped out a lot.
[1:35:48.120 --> 1:35:53.120]  And they have a 1-2-3 punch that I've been making copies of and handing out.
[1:35:53.120 --> 1:35:59.120]  And first it's Press for Truth, Mysteries, and then you knock them down with Terror Storm.
[1:35:59.120 --> 1:36:01.120]  It's the Truth 1-2-3 Knockout.
[1:36:01.120 --> 1:36:05.120]  Hey, that's a good term and good name to use. Anything else?
[1:36:05.120 --> 1:36:14.120]  That's it. I just want to tell you that also that freaky pastor that was doing meth, he is moving to some state away from Colorado.
[1:36:14.120 --> 1:36:20.120]  And Colorado also announced today a bill to require the HPV vaccine.
[1:36:20.120 --> 1:36:24.120]  That's right. They're lobbying in all 50 states. Thanks for the call.
[1:36:24.120 --> 1:36:29.120]  Yeah, the pervert pastor who was big buddies with Bush.
[1:36:29.120 --> 1:36:31.120]  I mean, look, what they do in their lives is their business.
[1:36:31.120 --> 1:36:35.120]  The point is they're fake Christian conservatives. They're not real.
[1:36:35.120 --> 1:36:44.120]  And to join the Republican echelon higher level clubs, well, being homosexual is just the beginning of it.
[1:36:44.120 --> 1:36:49.120]  But that's, I mean, that's just the opening. That just opens the door.
[1:36:49.120 --> 1:36:52.120]  You've got to get on your knees and tell Satan you're loving.
[1:36:52.120 --> 1:36:54.120]  And I'm serious when I say that.
[1:36:54.120 --> 1:36:59.120]  And that's probably what gets listeners like Wellington saying cuckoo and fruit loot.
[1:36:59.120 --> 1:37:01.120]  Hey, I know it's cuckoo and fruit loot.
[1:37:01.120 --> 1:37:07.120]  But if I report say on the hillside strangler who carved a pentagram in his hand and said prayers to Satan in the courtroom,
[1:37:07.120 --> 1:37:14.120]  it doesn't make me cuckoo as a crime reporter to report on what someone who's cuckoo is doing.
[1:37:14.120 --> 1:37:20.120]  I mean, yeah, Jeffrey Dahmer slicing people up, putting them in his freezer, putting them in 50 gallon drums,
[1:37:20.120 --> 1:37:32.120]  injecting acid into their brains to have sex zombies. That's totally out of control and freaky and sick and stenches to high heaven.
[1:37:32.120 --> 1:37:39.120]  I mean, if it stenches to our nostrils, our psychic nostrils, can you imagine what it's like to God?
[1:37:39.120 --> 1:37:44.120]  But it doesn't. I'm not fruit loop because I report on the fruit loops.
[1:37:44.120 --> 1:37:51.120]  So many times atheist email me and go, Alex, I don't believe in God. I don't believe in all that club trap.
[1:37:51.120 --> 1:37:57.120]  You know, why are you reporting on bohemian grove and skull and bones? That stuff doesn't exist.
[1:37:57.120 --> 1:38:02.120]  Just because you believe God doesn't exist.
[1:38:02.120 --> 1:38:05.120]  And that's your right. I think you're stupid, but fine.
[1:38:05.120 --> 1:38:11.120]  But we're not talking about that. I mean, you don't believe God exists, but you know there's people who believe in Jesus.
[1:38:11.120 --> 1:38:17.120]  There's people who believe in Buddha. Are you saying just because you don't believe God exists that no one else believes it?
[1:38:17.120 --> 1:38:21.120]  Or if you talk about someone's belief, it doesn't exist?
[1:38:21.120 --> 1:38:27.120]  That Alex Jones is crazy. He talks about the occult and how occult groups are running things.
[1:38:27.120 --> 1:38:32.120]  Have you looked at the symbolism? Have you looked at the icons, the logos, the signants?
[1:38:32.120 --> 1:38:37.120]  Have you just looked at the culture?
[1:38:37.120 --> 1:38:43.120]  My parents had a television outside on their deck last night.
[1:38:43.120 --> 1:38:47.120]  And I went over there for the barbecue and the Super Bowl was on.
[1:38:47.120 --> 1:38:53.120]  And I was watching the cults run over the bubbares.
[1:38:53.120 --> 1:38:59.120]  I didn't watch the whole thing. I got off the radio at six, went over there for an hour, ate dinner, took the kids home.
[1:38:59.120 --> 1:39:02.120]  And I went to work studying on the activities of the globalists.
[1:39:02.120 --> 1:39:08.120]  Side issue.
[1:39:08.120 --> 1:39:13.120]  I mean, I start telling one story and forget about what the last story was.
[1:39:13.120 --> 1:39:16.120]  Why was I talking about the ads? The ads.
[1:39:16.120 --> 1:39:19.120]  We had to turn the TV off during the ads.
[1:39:19.120 --> 1:39:26.120]  I mean, every ad was men kissing or people beating each other up or women acting like demon possessed,
[1:39:26.120 --> 1:39:34.120]  Hellions, Banshee and Warmox, and just their training is how to be animals.
[1:39:34.120 --> 1:39:37.120]  Oh, you just don't want us to have fun. That stuff's fun.
[1:39:37.120 --> 1:39:42.120]  No, that stuff activates your lower brain and conditions you to operate at a lower level,
[1:39:42.120 --> 1:39:49.120]  not in the conscious cerebral cortex, intuitive reaches take over,
[1:39:49.120 --> 1:39:55.120]  and then all you've got is the bestial level and control.
[1:39:55.120 --> 1:40:04.120]  But Richard Nixon did give an interview to Harper's Magazine and said that they have homosexual orgies at Bohemian Grove.
[1:40:04.120 --> 1:40:16.120]  It's got to be 60, 70 newspapers and magazines that have reported about the Learjet's landing with a $2,000 an hour mail prostitutes at Bohemian Grove.
[1:40:16.120 --> 1:40:23.120]  I mean, Robert De Niro makes a historical movie about the Good Shepherd, about the CIA.
[1:40:23.120 --> 1:40:27.120]  And it's got satanic rituals in it.
[1:40:27.120 --> 1:40:30.120]  People urinating on each other.
[1:40:30.120 --> 1:40:36.120]  A guy dressed up like the devil with a gold crown on, inducting them into a satanic order.
[1:40:36.120 --> 1:40:45.120]  Folks, that isn't just fraternity fun, because as old men, they go and they do the same type rituals, and I've been in the crowd.
[1:40:45.120 --> 1:41:00.120]  Just like at church when you're sitting in the pews, but the pews was a grassy slope overlooking a little lake with a huge idol of men in red and black robes and a high priest in a white robe, high level Luciferian activity.
[1:41:00.120 --> 1:41:03.120]  And they did engage in that.
[1:41:03.120 --> 1:41:11.120]  And just because you don't believe in it, doesn't mean they don't believe in it.
[1:41:11.120 --> 1:41:14.120]  And truth is stranger than fiction.
[1:41:14.120 --> 1:41:24.120]  And when you understand their drive, their mindset, their worldview, why they think like this, why they do this.
[1:41:24.120 --> 1:41:28.120]  When you understand their worldview and how sinister they are and how they enjoy.
[1:41:28.120 --> 1:41:32.120]  By the way, it's a YouTube clip, so the audio is not the best.
[1:41:32.120 --> 1:41:40.120]  Somebody grabbed it off a 16-bit stream off the radio show, but I think what I said in the little nine-minute clip really says it all.
[1:41:40.120 --> 1:41:46.120]  Did you get that, John?
[1:41:46.120 --> 1:41:54.120]  Yeah, I think we've barely got time to play it in this segment, but we'll play it at the bottom of the next hour.
[1:41:54.120 --> 1:41:58.120]  We'll play it at the bottom of the next hour, because I want to be able to play it in this entirety.
[1:41:58.120 --> 1:42:01.120]  I was listening to it this morning.
[1:42:01.120 --> 1:42:12.120]  We'll get a little vignette of the more informative things I say, and I think it needs to be re-heared from a few weeks ago.
[1:42:12.120 --> 1:42:14.120]  But right now, let's just go back to your calls.
[1:42:14.120 --> 1:42:16.120]  Let's talk to Roman in California.
[1:42:16.120 --> 1:42:18.120]  Thanks for holding your year on the year.
[1:42:18.120 --> 1:42:19.120]  Yes, Alex.
[1:42:19.120 --> 1:42:23.120]  I just want to say a few things regarding Freemasonry.
[1:42:23.120 --> 1:42:30.120]  The first one is, how come you don't mention the fact that there aren't entirely different calendars than we are?
[1:42:30.120 --> 1:42:35.120]  And another thing, you can go ahead and answer that question if you want.
[1:42:35.120 --> 1:42:37.120]  Well, just go ahead and give me the other question.
[1:42:37.120 --> 1:42:45.120]  The other question is, how come you don't call 9-11 what it is, a Freemasonic operation to take our freedoms?
[1:42:45.120 --> 1:42:53.120]  Everybody involved in that operation was a Freemason at the high levels, so why don't you ever talk about that?
[1:42:53.120 --> 1:43:02.120]  Well, I know that after the French Revolution, the occultists over there openly tried to bring them on to a, what, 10-month calendar?
[1:43:02.120 --> 1:43:08.120]  And they tried to abolish all the old holidays, and I know that there are several occultic calendars.
[1:43:08.120 --> 1:43:10.120]  But, I mean, is that what you're talking about?
[1:43:10.120 --> 1:43:11.120]  Yes.
[1:43:11.120 --> 1:43:13.120]  Okay, and then I also know...
[1:43:13.120 --> 1:43:18.120]  They call our time profane time, or vulgar time.
[1:43:18.120 --> 1:43:20.120]  Vulgar area.
[1:43:20.120 --> 1:43:22.120]  Yeah, vulgar area.
[1:43:22.120 --> 1:43:25.120]  The thing is, don't you think that's a little strange?
[1:43:25.120 --> 1:43:35.120]  We have something like 30 calendars all operating at once on different time shifts?
[1:43:35.120 --> 1:43:37.120]  Well, that's what diversity is all about.
[1:43:37.120 --> 1:43:40.120]  I'm glad we don't have one centralized system.
[1:43:40.120 --> 1:43:43.120]  Listen, I appreciate your call, sir.
[1:43:43.120 --> 1:43:46.120]  Every day I get emails, calls, letters.
[1:43:46.120 --> 1:43:50.120]  Why don't you say that the Vatican ran the attacks?
[1:43:50.120 --> 1:43:53.120]  Why don't you say the Jews ran the attacks?
[1:43:53.120 --> 1:43:55.120]  Why don't you say the Masons ran the attacks?
[1:43:55.120 --> 1:44:03.120]  I cover the entire spectrum of 9-11, every single facet, every single area.
[1:44:03.120 --> 1:44:09.120]  I cover what I think are the most important facets, and I bring guests on who cover all the others.
[1:44:09.120 --> 1:44:14.120]  And we've talked about the Israeli connections, and they're clearly there.
[1:44:14.120 --> 1:44:23.120]  We talk about them every couple days, and I'll get the calls, and the big exposés are written that I've never once talked about it.
[1:44:23.120 --> 1:44:28.120]  And I didn't talk about 9-11 for years after it.
[1:44:28.120 --> 1:44:29.120]  It was just totally untrue.
[1:44:29.120 --> 1:44:32.120]  I talked about it before it happened, the day it happened.
[1:44:32.120 --> 1:44:34.120]  Those are just operatives and disinfo people.
[1:44:34.120 --> 1:44:43.120]  Instead of us just knowing it's an inside job, they want to get us all fighting with each other instead of moving forward to educate the public that it was an inside job.
[1:44:43.120 --> 1:44:45.120]  And I'm not saying you're an operative, sir.
[1:44:45.120 --> 1:44:51.120]  You sound genuine, and you sound serious.
[1:44:51.120 --> 1:45:00.120]  But quite frankly, I don't believe that 9-11 was a free Masonic job.
[1:45:00.120 --> 1:45:03.120]  I mean, you've got 9-11, the Masonic numbers, you've got the two towers.
[1:45:03.120 --> 1:45:08.120]  You use the Masonic rituals where they have the ritual of knocking down the two pillars.
[1:45:08.120 --> 1:45:11.120]  You have all the weird numerology.
[1:45:11.120 --> 1:45:15.120]  And so when we say free Masonic, I think that limits it.
[1:45:15.120 --> 1:45:20.120]  You do have occultic groups that control the leadership of the Masonic order.
[1:45:20.120 --> 1:45:27.120]  So the average Mason here, as you say this, and they think it's about fraternity and good works and, you know, the rest of it.
[1:45:27.120 --> 1:45:29.120]  And of course, it isn't.
[1:45:29.120 --> 1:45:32.120]  And so we need to say Illuminati.
[1:45:32.120 --> 1:45:48.120]  And the Illuminati philosophy is the religion of the secular groups, whether it be the Kabbalic people in Israel or the Faustian types out of Germany, the death cults.
[1:45:48.120 --> 1:45:50.120]  It all goes together.
[1:45:50.120 --> 1:45:52.120]  They're all on the same team.
[1:45:52.120 --> 1:45:57.120]  So all I'm ever saying is people get confused.
[1:45:57.120 --> 1:46:00.120]  They say, who runs the New World Order?
[1:46:00.120 --> 1:46:04.120]  Who's behind the New World Order?
[1:46:04.120 --> 1:46:07.120]  You know, is it the Germans?
[1:46:07.120 --> 1:46:08.120]  Is it the Jews?
[1:46:08.120 --> 1:46:09.120]  Is it the Catholics?
[1:46:09.120 --> 1:46:11.120]  Is it the Protestants?
[1:46:11.120 --> 1:46:13.120]  Is it the CIA?
[1:46:13.120 --> 1:46:15.120]  Is it the on and on and on?
[1:46:15.120 --> 1:46:22.120]  And you study the Council on Fine Relations and the Royal Institute of International Affairs and the Bilderberg Group.
[1:46:22.120 --> 1:46:29.120]  It's the same handful, less than 50 people, that share and run all the other groups.
[1:46:29.120 --> 1:46:31.120]  It's a big world.
[1:46:31.120 --> 1:46:43.120]  The CFR is the management arm, the high-level foot soldiers, the enforcers, the implementers, the managers that carry out the policy of the Bilderberg Group.
[1:46:43.120 --> 1:46:52.120]  And they have a similar group over Germany, the Royal Institute of International Affairs, the Roundtable Groups as they're called, that it's modeled off of in England.
[1:46:52.120 --> 1:47:01.120]  They have similar ruling councils where the people that are in the power positions in Japan actually go meet once a week or once a month when needed in their group.
[1:47:01.120 --> 1:47:06.120]  This is how human systems operate.
[1:47:06.120 --> 1:47:08.120]  And they got Catholics at the highest levels.
[1:47:08.120 --> 1:47:12.120]  The Pope's New World Order calls for one world government, one world religion.
[1:47:12.120 --> 1:47:13.120]  No debate, it's evil.
[1:47:13.120 --> 1:47:15.120]  No debate, it's bad.
[1:47:15.120 --> 1:47:19.120]  But no, people don't want us to just say, okay, we know it's bad now.
[1:47:19.120 --> 1:47:28.120]  No, no, no, no, their tactic is to get you debating how long it's been bad or what's preeminent in the structure.
[1:47:28.120 --> 1:47:34.120]  And so the infighting can start instead of, we know the Catholic Church is pro-one world government in New World Order.
[1:47:34.120 --> 1:47:38.120]  We know the Protestant leaders are saying, go ahead and take a chip.
[1:47:38.120 --> 1:47:40.120]  Go ahead and give up your rights.
[1:47:40.120 --> 1:47:44.120]  Go ahead and biometrically scan.
[1:47:44.120 --> 1:47:49.120]  We know that the head of the Masonic organizations are pushing for a one world government.
[1:47:49.120 --> 1:47:51.120]  It's a pyramidal power structure.
[1:47:51.120 --> 1:47:53.120]  We know that Germany's total New World Order.
[1:47:53.120 --> 1:47:55.120]  We know Israel's total New World Order.
[1:47:55.120 --> 1:47:57.120]  We know Egypt's total New World Order.
[1:47:57.120 --> 1:47:59.120]  We know England's total New World Order.
[1:47:59.120 --> 1:48:03.120]  We know Canada's total New World Order.
[1:48:03.120 --> 1:48:13.120]  And so we know that they're interlocking global corporations that combine their strengths and make strategic alliances and deals to go in and lobby and take over governments
[1:48:13.120 --> 1:48:15.120]  and give themselves governmental powers.
[1:48:15.120 --> 1:48:18.120]  That's what globalization is all about in the final phases.
[1:48:18.120 --> 1:48:19.120]  And we know this is happening.
[1:48:19.120 --> 1:48:28.120]  So let's just fight the North American Union and let's fight any religious group or any Christian domination that calls for one world government.
[1:48:28.120 --> 1:48:35.120]  And let's just go after the bad guys and let's come together.
[1:48:35.120 --> 1:48:37.120]  That's all I've ever called for.
[1:48:37.120 --> 1:48:40.120]  And it limits to say it's just the Catholics.
[1:48:40.120 --> 1:48:41.120]  It's just the Jews.
[1:48:41.120 --> 1:48:42.120]  It's just the British.
[1:48:42.120 --> 1:48:51.120]  It is elitist in the power positions of every major country and every major derivation of the human race teaming up together.
[1:48:51.120 --> 1:48:53.120]  And they occasionally stab each other in the back.
[1:48:53.120 --> 1:48:56.120]  They occasionally do those type of things.
[1:48:56.120 --> 1:49:01.120]  But generally they're unified against the people of the planet.
[1:49:01.120 --> 1:49:03.120]  Always trying to consolidate power.
[1:49:03.120 --> 1:49:05.120]  Always trying to dumb down.
[1:49:05.120 --> 1:49:08.120]  So they're together on feeding on us.
[1:49:08.120 --> 1:49:15.120]  And basically it's like we're a bay off the larger Atlantic Ocean.
[1:49:15.120 --> 1:49:18.120]  And we're fish in the bay.
[1:49:18.120 --> 1:49:22.120]  And there's a governing council that regulates the fishing.
[1:49:22.120 --> 1:49:28.120]  And the fishermen compete and they fight with each other and they go and complain to the board and they do all this.
[1:49:28.120 --> 1:49:29.120]  But they're fishermen.
[1:49:29.120 --> 1:49:31.120]  We're fish.
[1:49:31.120 --> 1:49:32.120]  Okay.
[1:49:32.120 --> 1:49:39.120]  And so you've got different companies that have an independent fisherman and they're always trying to cut each other out and make better deals.
[1:49:39.120 --> 1:49:41.120]  But still they're fishermen.
[1:49:41.120 --> 1:49:45.120]  We're fish.
[1:49:45.120 --> 1:49:52.120]  And so that's just how we're seen by the predatory ruling class.
[1:49:52.120 --> 1:49:54.120]  And so you beat them when you get local control.
[1:49:54.120 --> 1:49:57.120]  You beat them when you reduce the size of government.
[1:49:57.120 --> 1:50:00.120]  You beat them when the people have the Second Amendment to defend themselves.
[1:50:00.120 --> 1:50:13.120]  You beat them when you beat their forced vaccinations and their forced inoculations and their one-child policies and their cameras.
[1:50:13.120 --> 1:50:15.120]  I want to take action.
[1:50:15.120 --> 1:50:17.120]  I want to have an effect.
[1:50:17.120 --> 1:50:25.120]  I want to go out and deal with these issues and discredit the corporate mainstream-owned media that is desperately trying to consolidate.
[1:50:25.120 --> 1:50:44.120]  You know, when the big Spanish toll company slash Australian toll company rushes in and buys up all these key Texas and Oklahoma papers along the trans-Texas NAFTA Highway grid.
[1:50:44.120 --> 1:50:48.120]  And they're all the papers that we're criticizing and mobilizing the people.
[1:50:48.120 --> 1:50:49.120]  I mean, let's deal.
[1:50:49.120 --> 1:50:53.120]  Let's make sure that Perry is discredited and everybody knows it's a hoax.
[1:50:53.120 --> 1:50:55.120]  You don't have to take the vaccine. There is no law.
[1:50:55.120 --> 1:50:58.120]  It's a live cancer virus causing serious medical problems.
[1:50:58.120 --> 1:51:03.120]  I mean, I tune into most of the other Patriot shows on other little networks or websites and I listen to people.
[1:51:03.120 --> 1:51:06.120]  And there's none of this information.
[1:51:06.120 --> 1:51:12.120]  It's just frothing and attacking everyone else because they're out there to fight the New World Order, folks.
[1:51:12.120 --> 1:51:16.120]  They're there to make themselves somehow the kings of the Patriot movement.
[1:51:16.120 --> 1:51:18.120]  And that's why they dig a pit for somebody else.
[1:51:18.120 --> 1:51:19.120]  They fall into it.
[1:51:19.120 --> 1:51:23.120]  We need to get our heads screwed on straight here.
[1:51:23.120 --> 1:51:24.120]  All right.
[1:51:24.120 --> 1:51:25.120]  We'll be right back.
[1:51:25.120 --> 1:51:26.120]  I'm Alex Jones.
[1:51:26.120 --> 1:51:30.120]  Your call straight ahead will get into the vaccines, get into the global news and a lot more.
[1:51:35.120 --> 1:51:39.120]  It's here after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[1:51:39.120 --> 1:51:41.120]  Mighty Film Terror Storm is complete.
[1:51:41.120 --> 1:51:49.120]  Shocking, declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[1:51:49.120 --> 1:51:57.120]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[1:51:57.120 --> 1:52:09.120]  Terror Storm Chronicles, the lies that focused a war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spy, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[1:52:09.120 --> 1:52:13.120]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[1:52:13.120 --> 1:52:15.120]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[1:52:15.120 --> 1:52:19.120]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[1:55:02.120 --> 1:55:13.120]  My new police state films, that is, they're new that they've been put on DVD for the first time. All three of them in one box set on three different DVDs.
[1:55:13.120 --> 1:55:24.120]  This is the police state 2000, police state 2, the takeover, police state 3, total enslavement 34.95 or 45% off, available at infowars.com.
[1:55:24.120 --> 1:55:29.120]  American Freedom to Fascism by Aaron Russo. We've got a discount on that when you get it with Terror Storm.
[1:55:29.120 --> 1:55:42.120]  Terror Storm is half-off, or 9.95. We've got deals where you can get films. One of my better films that just absolutely exposes the false left-right paradigm, and that's American dictators.
[1:55:42.120 --> 1:55:47.120]  Again, that's available at infowars.com or prisonplanet.com.
[1:55:47.120 --> 1:55:52.120]  A little bit dingy today, I told you I have really bad allergies with cedar fever.
[1:55:52.120 --> 1:56:00.120]  And I sat out all yesterday with a chainsaw with my dad clearing brush on his little farm.
[1:56:00.120 --> 1:56:07.120]  And then I sat outside watching the Super Bowl with him and, man, this morning it hit me.
[1:56:07.120 --> 1:56:12.120]  Little, like, 40-point IQ reduction, sniveling sniffles.
[1:56:12.120 --> 1:56:19.120]  So if I sound a bit bumbling, it's because I'm having an enjoyable allergy attack right now, big time.
[1:56:19.120 --> 1:56:24.120]  But it's just for these couple months right now that it happens in Texas.
[1:56:24.120 --> 1:56:30.120]  Let's go ahead and take another call. Bruce, in Washington, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[1:56:30.120 --> 1:56:32.120]  Hi, Alex. This is Bruce.
[1:56:32.120 --> 1:56:33.120]  Welcome.
[1:56:33.120 --> 1:56:34.120]  Hi.
[1:56:34.120 --> 1:56:42.120]  I just want to, first of all, thank you for having the courage and the spirit to stand up to what's going on in our world
[1:56:42.120 --> 1:56:46.120]  and the matrix of the complexity of these criminals.
[1:56:46.120 --> 1:56:50.120]  You remember how we made King George swim back to England?
[1:56:50.120 --> 1:56:54.120]  I think that it comes down to what you're saying.
[1:56:54.120 --> 1:56:59.120]  Well, the difference is today some of the general publics say King George doesn't exist.
[1:56:59.120 --> 1:57:04.120]  Imagine in 1776 they just said, the elite is enslaving us and they said, there's no such thing.
[1:57:04.120 --> 1:57:09.120]  There's no ruling class. I mean, that's how dumbed down the public's gotten.
[1:57:09.120 --> 1:57:17.120]  Yeah, and this burning of the brush or the awareness of the fishermen, you know, what they're actually doing,
[1:57:17.120 --> 1:57:25.120]  each one of us, the responsibility of each one of us is so extreme. It has an effect upon the world.
[1:57:25.120 --> 1:57:32.120]  And I think that is what you're really after, is to get people to just look and see what's going on.
[1:57:32.120 --> 1:57:35.120]  Yeah, that's it. I mean, there's all these people that have the knowledge of the New World Order,
[1:57:35.120 --> 1:57:39.120]  but then debate my new shit. Get out there and just wake folks up.
[1:57:39.120 --> 1:57:45.120]  And then they play with, they want us to play with the little symbols and words and get stuck in that matrix, you know?
[1:57:45.120 --> 1:57:51.120]  And the thing of it is, I just want to say I had really admired what you, you know, that,
[1:57:51.120 --> 1:57:58.120]  I admired that spirit behind you and me and every one of us who's standing up to this behemoth, you know?
[1:57:58.120 --> 1:58:04.120]  And I made a 9-11 memorial bus with all the victims' photos on it.
[1:58:04.120 --> 1:58:10.120]  Well, I was in New York at Ground Zero and I thought, who are these people shouting 9-11 was an inside job?
[1:58:10.120 --> 1:58:14.120]  These people are crazy because I was a Bush cheerleader before.
[1:58:14.120 --> 1:58:21.120]  And I got one of those DVDs, Loose Change, I watched it.
[1:58:21.120 --> 1:58:24.120]  I said, no, that can't be. I'll watch it again.
[1:58:24.120 --> 1:58:28.120]  After about four times I said, okay, something's going on.
[1:58:28.120 --> 1:58:35.120]  So like Colombo, you know how Colombo saw what was going on when he started investigating the crime?
[1:58:35.120 --> 1:58:38.120]  He started asking questions and investigating.
[1:58:38.120 --> 1:58:44.120]  Yeah, but he kind of knew from the beginning, you know, something's not right here.
[1:58:44.120 --> 1:58:51.120]  So this projection of this new world order, this whole conglomeration of criminals,
[1:58:51.120 --> 1:58:58.120]  they project their altars and matrixes in what we call our false self and we just go along with it
[1:58:58.120 --> 1:59:03.120]  and it's dreadful for one to realize that, hey, I found a lie.
[1:59:03.120 --> 1:59:08.120]  Tell you what, stay there. I want to hear about which Ground Zero event you were at, how long ago you woke up
[1:59:08.120 --> 1:59:12.120]  because you really got it. We'll be right back.
[1:59:12.120 --> 1:59:22.120]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNLive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[1:59:22.120 --> 1:59:28.120]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[1:59:28.120 --> 1:59:33.120]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere,
[1:59:33.120 --> 1:59:36.120]  which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[1:59:36.120 --> 1:59:43.120]  Medical course, potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[1:59:43.120 --> 1:59:51.120]  Radioactive poisoning, potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[1:59:51.120 --> 2:00:00.120]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing. The harm is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs
[2:00:00.120 --> 2:00:03.120]  in children, the elderly, the sick and pets.
[2:00:03.120 --> 2:00:13.120]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5 by calling new millennium at 888-803-4438.

[2:00:22.120 --> 2:00:28.120]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:00:34.120 --> 2:00:42.120]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[2:00:42.120 --> 2:00:46.120]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:00:46.120 --> 2:00:51.120]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:53.120 --> 2:01:02.120]  Already into the third and final hour, got a little five-minute posh news clip about Perry and the attempted fourth conoculation with live cancer virus.
[2:01:02.120 --> 2:01:08.120]  That's coming up. I want to go into Iran and a lot more. We've got open phones right now.
[2:01:08.120 --> 2:01:12.120]  We're talking to Bruce in Washington.
[2:01:12.120 --> 2:01:19.120]  And Bruce said he was at 9-11 at Ground Zero with a 9-11 bus commemorating all those that died.
[2:01:19.120 --> 2:01:23.120]  And he saw people shouting and saying it was an inside job. He thought they were nuts.
[2:01:23.120 --> 2:01:28.120]  He got given a free copy of Loose Change, second edition. When was that? How long ago was this?
[2:01:28.120 --> 2:01:35.120]  Well, that was September 8th, 9th, 10th and 11th. It was there. It was at all the crash sites.
[2:01:35.120 --> 2:01:39.120]  But which year? Last year or the year before?
[2:01:39.120 --> 2:01:41.120]  Yes, sir. This is last year.
[2:01:41.120 --> 2:01:44.120]  So in four or five months, you're totally awake now?
[2:01:44.120 --> 2:01:53.120]  Oh, well, thank God. I have quite a history of being a chaplain's assistant in the Navy.
[2:01:53.120 --> 2:01:58.120]  I never could figure out why are chaplains in the Navy.
[2:01:58.120 --> 2:02:09.120]  But in either case, I had all my blindfolds on and I was going along with Cheerleader Dress with Bush and the whole gimmick of war.
[2:02:09.120 --> 2:02:18.120]  And I just started questioning it. I started questioning it because I see so many divisions in the world in chaos.
[2:02:18.120 --> 2:02:31.120]  And what these globalists want is to bring order out of chaos, whereas the real transformation is understanding the whole matrix of chaos and division.
[2:02:31.120 --> 2:02:33.120]  Exactly.
[2:02:33.120 --> 2:02:39.120]  And it starts with our own selves, with each one of us, not out there.
[2:02:39.120 --> 2:02:44.120]  Well, what are you doing now in closing? What are you doing now to wake others up about 9-11?
[2:02:44.120 --> 2:02:51.120]  Well, the memorial bus I still have, I'm going to ask if it's okay if I put infowars.com on it.
[2:02:51.120 --> 2:02:53.120]  You don't have to ask. It's a free country. Boys, do it.
[2:02:53.120 --> 2:03:06.120]  Yes, sir. And I want to alert the American people about what's actually happening, just like John F. Kennedy said before they whacked him and his son.
[2:03:06.120 --> 2:03:21.120]  The danger is so severe that I think that most of us, unfortunately, we would rather go with our lolly-daw plus entertainment.
[2:03:21.120 --> 2:03:27.120]  Yeah, propaganda is designed to just make you feel good and go to sleep and it speaks to your own procrastination.
[2:03:27.120 --> 2:03:34.120]  Good to hear from you. Call me back as you begin your demonstrations and activities. Bruce, good to hear from you.
[2:03:34.120 --> 2:03:37.120]  Let's talk to Mike in New York. Mike, go ahead.
[2:03:37.120 --> 2:03:40.120]  Hi, Alex. Nice to talk to you again. Thanks for taking my call.
[2:03:40.120 --> 2:03:41.120]  Thanks for calling.
[2:03:41.120 --> 2:03:51.120]  Alex, all your work is just proof of the kind of success you get with another guy coming up to speed like Bruce and that Wellington guy out there.
[2:03:51.120 --> 2:04:02.120]  If he maybe would exercise that little peanut between his ears and watch some of your videos and keep listening to your shows, he'll snap out of that boob tube trance state that he's currently in.
[2:04:02.120 --> 2:04:10.120]  Well, it is a trance state that's even taught in RTF. The television does put you into a mesmerized sleep state.
[2:04:10.120 --> 2:04:15.120]  You know, Alex, I think that's why they call the TV shows programing.
[2:04:15.120 --> 2:04:18.120]  I agree. It's just in your face.
[2:04:18.120 --> 2:04:30.120]  That's right, pal. Now, Alex, I'm going to highlight a major tidbit of information revealed through the Fox News coverage.
[2:04:30.120 --> 2:04:36.120]  I think it was Shleppard Smith commenting on the Ed Brown case.
[2:04:36.120 --> 2:04:37.120]  Okay.
[2:04:37.120 --> 2:04:43.120]  Okay, concerning the IRS in New Hampshire, the guy saying he's going to basically have a stand.
[2:04:43.120 --> 2:04:45.120]  Yep. Fox was covering it.
[2:04:45.120 --> 2:04:56.120]  I think I heard it over the power hour last Friday, and it was something to the effect of a major conflict of ideology going on in New Hampshire.
[2:04:56.120 --> 2:05:00.120]  Okay, so there it is. It's not a conflict of a criminal versus a law.
[2:05:00.120 --> 2:05:04.120]  It's not a conflict of somebody that's resisting to obey the law.
[2:05:04.120 --> 2:05:24.120]  It's a conflict of ideology that proves right there that Ed Brown and the rest of us are simply not following a coercive force trying to extort money out of our pockets when there isn't any law under the constitutional government that demands that we pay that.
[2:05:24.120 --> 2:05:27.120]  I agree. We'll be right back. Thanks for the call.
[2:05:27.120 --> 2:05:30.120]  Clips, news, and your call straight ahead.
[2:05:30.120 --> 2:05:36.120]  It's here after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[2:05:36.120 --> 2:05:39.120]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[2:05:39.120 --> 2:05:47.120]  Shocking, declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[2:05:47.120 --> 2:05:55.120]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[2:05:55.120 --> 2:06:07.120]  Terror Storm Chronicles, the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spy, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[2:06:07.120 --> 2:06:13.120]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrors. It's an anthology of government crimes.
[2:06:13.120 --> 2:06:17.120]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[2:06:30.120 --> 2:06:34.120]  Dad, can we stop? We need to go to the bathroom.
[2:06:34.120 --> 2:06:37.120]  What? Again? We just stopped two hours ago.
[2:06:37.120 --> 2:06:42.120]  Honey, let's stop because I gave the kids their spark-burkey water bottles.
[2:06:42.120 --> 2:06:44.120]  Why did you do that?
[2:06:44.120 --> 2:06:48.120]  Because they can't drink and talk at the same time, and that way we don't have to listen to them singing,
[2:06:48.120 --> 2:06:52.120]  Are we there yet? Are we there yet? for the entire trip.
[2:06:52.120 --> 2:06:56.120]  Hmm, I didn't think about that. Great idea.
[2:06:56.120 --> 2:06:59.120]  Yeah, and it's cheap entertainment for the kids.
[2:06:59.120 --> 2:07:06.120]  Bottled water costs around 75 cents a bottle, and using our burkey sport bottles, it costs us less than 2.5 cents per refill.
[2:07:06.120 --> 2:07:09.120]  Honey, you're terrific.
[2:07:09.120 --> 2:07:14.120]  Oh, honey, so are you. You're the one that bought the family our sport burkey water bottles.
[2:07:14.120 --> 2:07:17.120]  Now can we stop? I need to go too.
[2:07:17.120 --> 2:07:24.120]  Get your burkey sport purification bottle for only $39 by calling new millennium at 888-803-4438.
[2:07:24.120 --> 2:07:30.120]  That's 888-803-4438, or order on the web at burkeywater.com.
[2:07:30.120 --> 2:07:31.120]  Shall I use my g-
[2:07:31.120 --> 2:07:33.120]  Oh wait, why did you turn that down?
[2:07:33.120 --> 2:07:39.120]  I get so tired of that girl's squeaky voice. I'm sure the bed fan works, but that's squeaky voice.
[2:07:39.120 --> 2:07:40.120]  Well, what's the bed fan?
[2:07:40.120 --> 2:07:43.120]  It's a fan that helps hot sleepers stay cool at night.
[2:07:43.120 --> 2:07:47.120]  I could use something like that. This menopause thing is really getting to me at night,
[2:07:47.120 --> 2:07:50.120]  and you know how I am about doing that hormone therapy thing.
[2:07:50.120 --> 2:07:54.120]  Besides, you're a hot sleeper yourself. You're always throwing the covers off in the middle of the night.
[2:07:54.120 --> 2:07:59.120]  I guess you're right. Why don't we try it? Just think how nice it'll be to sleep through the night.
[2:07:59.120 --> 2:08:03.120]  Yeah, and just think how nice it'll be this summer and all the money we can save on air conditioning.
[2:08:03.120 --> 2:08:05.120]  I know where we can get some more information.
[2:08:05.120 --> 2:08:10.120]  Sleep disorder centers across the country recommend that you must stay cool to get a good night's sleep.
[2:08:10.120 --> 2:08:13.120]  The bed fan will keep you cool and give you the restful sleep you deserve.
[2:08:13.120 --> 2:08:17.120]  With our 30-day 100% guarantee, you risk nothing.
[2:08:17.120 --> 2:08:21.120]  Are you a hot sleeper? Is your partner a hot sleeper? The bed fan is the answer.
[2:08:21.120 --> 2:08:28.120]  Visit us today at www.bedfan.com. That's www.bedfan.com.
[2:08:28.120 --> 2:08:33.120]  This is the T-Rex of political talk.
[2:08:33.120 --> 2:08:38.120]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:08:38.120 --> 2:08:46.120]  We're going to continue with your calls in the shower, but I want to get back into Rick Perry and exactly what he's doing.
[2:08:46.120 --> 2:08:51.120]  Here's a Fox News piece, Propaganda piece concerning it.
[2:08:51.120 --> 2:09:01.120]  Let's play the piece, then analyze it, then recap exactly what's happening and how important this is, because this is a national push that's taking place right now to try to force this.
[2:09:01.120 --> 2:09:10.120]  And as usual, Texas is the front line. No wonder God put the center of the movement right here in Austin, Texas, the capital against it. Here it is.
[2:09:10.120 --> 2:09:25.120]  Found in fury today after a controversial decision by Texas Governor Rick Perry, he unexpectedly signed an executive order Friday, making Texas the first state to require young girls to be vaccinated against HPV, that's a sexually transmitted disease that can cause cervical cancer.
[2:09:25.120 --> 2:09:30.120]  So is this a smart and effective way to keep girls safe, or is it an infringement on parental rights?
[2:09:30.120 --> 2:09:40.120]  Andy Shafley is with the Council for Eagle Forum, a conservative pro-family organization, as well as being an attorney for the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons.
[2:09:40.120 --> 2:09:48.120]  Also weighing in, Democratic Texas State Representative Jessica Farrar, she authored a bill requiring the HPV vaccine for the girls before Governor Perry issued that executive order.
[2:09:48.120 --> 2:09:55.120]  Welcome back to both of you, and Andy, beginning with you, what are you opposed really to what some say could be a life-saving vaccine?
[2:09:55.120 --> 2:10:13.120]  The vaccine is available for parents who want it, but to require parents to give this vaccine to their children before they enter the sixth grade, to give it to 11-year-old girls for a disease that's not detected until an average age of 48 just doesn't make sense.
[2:10:13.120 --> 2:10:20.120]  Michigan looked at this, they said no, we're not going to require this. Indiana looked at it, they said no, Maryland looked at it, they said no, we're not going to require it.
[2:10:20.120 --> 2:10:37.120]  These are not particularly conservative states, but here Texas, and the Texas legislature was not going to require it either, but the Texas governor, 60% of Texas has voted against three months ago, has gone out of his way, bypassed the Democratic process, and imposed his vaccine on parents.
[2:10:37.120 --> 2:10:39.120]  And there's no easy opt-out either from this.
[2:10:39.120 --> 2:10:54.120]  I'm going to ask you, Jessica, why do you support this move when many are saying one thing to oppose it for is because it takes away the rights of a parent to decide what is best for his or her child. Is this a dangerous precedent to be set and then lead to other parental rights that could be taken away?
[2:10:54.120 --> 2:11:18.120]  I see the issue quite differently. The requiring the vaccine does several things. First of all, it ensures that more children are vaccinated, and also it triggers, if it's on the list of required vaccines by the state, it triggers health insurance companies to cover it, and Medicaid will cover it, and CHIP will cover it, thereby allowing access for more Texans.
[2:11:18.120 --> 2:11:26.120]  You know, Andy, the law already requires children to be vaccinated against other diseases such as polio, so how is this vaccination different?
[2:11:26.120 --> 2:11:44.120]  This vaccination does not have the proven track record of polio. This is a new vaccine. It was just approved about six months ago. It was only tested on a few thousand teenage girls, and now they're planning on giving it, mandating it, for hundreds of thousands of 11-year-old girls.
[2:11:44.120 --> 2:11:47.120]  It just hasn't been proven. These girls are going to be guinea pigs.
[2:11:47.120 --> 2:11:57.120]  What's the best from a medical perspective? I mean, you would assume that the FDA would not allow something like this to be put in there, and there are things like booster shots. I mean, many of us who got vaccinated as kids had to have booster shots.
[2:11:57.120 --> 2:12:11.120]  I wouldn't assume the FDA is doing its job. They've been vaccinated in the past that have been approved, that have turned out not to be safe. You can go on the Internet and look at the things they did not test this vaccine for. They have not tested whether it causes cancer itself, for example.
[2:12:11.120 --> 2:12:19.120]  Jessica, you have to wonder why you think the governor signed this executive order. Why not let it run through the democratic process?
[2:12:19.120 --> 2:12:41.120]  Because it probably wouldn't have passed. Texas is a very conservative state. My bill didn't have much of a chance of passing. I think it took the executive order to just have public health policy in Texas, unfortunately. I'm glad that he did it.
[2:12:41.120 --> 2:12:57.120]  I have to realize cervical cancer is the second most common cancer affecting women, and this vaccine will go a long way towards preventing it, and I'm really proud that Texas will be the first state in the nation that will have an HPV vaccine program.
[2:12:57.120 --> 2:12:59.120]  Okay, very quickly. Andy, last words.
[2:12:59.120 --> 2:13:11.120]  If parents want it, they can get it, but there's no reason to require it, and this is just Merck getting billions of dollars in revenue to pay off its Vioxx debts and so on. This is just corporate work for Merck. If parents want it, they can get it.
[2:13:11.120 --> 2:13:13.120]  All right. Andy Shafley, Jessica.
[2:13:13.120 --> 2:13:26.120]  All right. I mean, I just wrote one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten different notes on that. We're writing an article about this, so I hope Paul tunes in to add this to his story.
[2:13:26.120 --> 2:13:35.120]  Number one, she lies and says it's the second biggest cause of cancer of the second most highly occurring cancer.
[2:13:35.120 --> 2:13:47.120]  That is totally ridiculous. It's well known in women that it's lung cancer, skin cancer, pancreatic cancer, liver cancer, literally, because I went and looked this up.
[2:13:47.120 --> 2:14:06.120]  It is at the end of the list behind hundreds of cancers. There are 9,700, and let me find the actual one for memory, 9,710 new cases of cervical cancer in the U.S. every year, and only a fraction of those die.
[2:14:06.120 --> 2:14:15.120]  Less than 400 women died in 2005 in Texas from complications from cervical cancer. It's highly treatable.
[2:14:15.120 --> 2:14:25.120]  So number one, just off that piece, she says it's the second most common form of cancer. Total lie.
[2:14:25.120 --> 2:14:35.120]  Then she admits that the legislature wasn't going to pass this, so do we even need a legislature anymore? He just signs an executive order. Hell, all he needs is a governor.
[2:14:35.120 --> 2:14:42.120]  And why even elect him? We'll just start saying that he's emperor for life, and then he just decides everything.
[2:14:42.120 --> 2:14:54.120]  Same thing with Bush. You can't just have a governor just say, you see, that executive order started with how big the governor's house would be, what type of plates they would have.
[2:14:54.120 --> 2:15:06.120]  It was executive order started with the president, back with George Washington and others for the first five or six presidents, where executive orders were how many plates to have, how to build a building for the presidency.
[2:15:06.120 --> 2:15:16.120]  It was executive orders were given to butlers about how many kegs of ale to buy for a party. Go read it. Go learn history.
[2:15:16.120 --> 2:15:25.120]  No, now executive orders are. I'm abolishing all the governors during time of attack or domestic insurgency. The president is now supreme dictator.
[2:15:25.120 --> 2:15:35.120]  That's the type of executive order. We can put everyone in slave camps and force them to work as slaves. Dozens of executive orders say that.
[2:15:35.120 --> 2:15:41.120]  I mean, this is fraud. This is dictatorship.
[2:15:41.120 --> 2:15:46.120]  So why even try to introduce a bill and have the legislature do it if you just signed executive order?
[2:15:46.120 --> 2:15:55.120]  The biggest fraud in the piece by both sides, both pro and con, is that other vaccines are good and other vaccines are mandatory.
[2:15:55.120 --> 2:15:59.120]  And you quote have to take them. He says it. She says it. The host says it.
[2:15:59.120 --> 2:16:11.120]  There is no law that you have to take it. It's not even a law. It is a state health department regulation for the schools to say as part of their policy it is required.
[2:16:11.120 --> 2:16:18.120]  There's no law. Then the school, because it isn't a law, tricks you. They won't even tell you about the waiver. Then you have to find out about the waiver.
[2:16:18.120 --> 2:16:23.120]  You don't even have to sign that waiver. You just say no. No, you're not doing it.
[2:16:23.120 --> 2:16:35.120]  Then they suspend you to then trigger truancy, but it's an unlawful truancy because they're the ones that suspended and they weren't allowed to suspend over the vaccine because there is no law.
[2:16:35.120 --> 2:16:44.120]  Do you understand that? It's just rings of frauds, tapestries of lies built on frauds, built on extortion, built on scams.
[2:16:44.120 --> 2:16:51.120]  The woman you heard the legislator on the show is on the payroll of Merck. That's the Associated Press in front of me.
[2:16:51.120 --> 2:17:00.120]  He's on the payroll. His former team of staff is on the payroll. The thing is failing nationwide. Girls are dying and getting sick and having autoimmune responses.
[2:17:00.120 --> 2:17:06.120]  Seizures coast to coast at massive levels just in the few states that have tried it.
[2:17:06.120 --> 2:17:14.120]  And so they're panicking with another Vioxx on their hand, so their option is go global, go wild.
[2:17:14.120 --> 2:17:21.120]  That's a tactic they use to just when they're in trouble, then expand and attack and go, everything's fine. Everything's good.
[2:17:21.120 --> 2:17:39.120]  Then the other fraud is they claim it's a conservative issue and it's implied. You know, it's those backwards troglodyte cavemen who were for abstinence and don't want their 10 and 11 year olds giving this to protect them from a sexually transmitted disease.
[2:17:39.120 --> 2:17:49.120]  Another lie I'm hearing on the news is this is the most common sexually transmitted disease. It's way down the list. 9,000 cases.
[2:17:49.120 --> 2:17:58.120]  There are tens of millions of cases of genital herpes, tens of millions of cases of genital warts every year.
[2:17:58.120 --> 2:18:04.120]  Go look the numbers up, but they're all over the news. I heard local radio news. I've got it in the newspaper. I've seen it on TV.
[2:18:04.120 --> 2:18:15.120]  Well, it's the most common form of sexually transmitted disease and we've got it. They count on you being dumb. They lie to you and say it's the second most common form of cancer.
[2:18:15.120 --> 2:18:29.120]  It's the most common form of STD. It's the lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies. Lie on top of lie, on top of lie, on top of lie.
[2:18:29.120 --> 2:18:34.120]  So they're on the merc payroll. It is not required. There is no law. It's a lie.
[2:18:34.120 --> 2:18:42.120]  I have the AP right here saying it wasn't immediately clear how long the order would last and whether the legislation was still necessary.
[2:18:42.120 --> 2:18:48.120]  See, the AP writer is so stupid. They just believe whatever press release Perry puts out. Perry says you have to take it now.
[2:18:48.120 --> 2:18:54.120]  There's no law. His executive order says, well, I'm now making it part of the recommended regiment.
[2:18:54.120 --> 2:19:03.120]  See, it's recommended, but they get on the news every year. You've all heard it a hundred times, more than a hundred. You've got to take all the vaccines.
[2:19:03.120 --> 2:19:11.120]  It's the law. It's the law. It's the law. It is a fraud, but the AP, Liz Austin Peterson out of Austin. I'm not trying to be mean.
[2:19:11.120 --> 2:19:20.120]  You know, if she listens to the show, I need to call her and go lady. You go, it's not clear. Of course, it's not clear if you don't know how the government works.
[2:19:20.120 --> 2:19:27.120]  The Perry just got up with a hoax and said, you have to take it. It's the law. You go read it. He has no power.
[2:19:27.120 --> 2:19:35.120]  It's an executive order saying he puts it on the state health department listed because he controls that state agency through his executive power.
[2:19:35.120 --> 2:19:41.120]  You understand? He just ordered bureaucrats to just tell the schools you have to.
[2:19:41.120 --> 2:19:48.120]  He's a lawless criminal who's being blackmailed for his personal activities.
[2:19:48.120 --> 2:19:58.120]  Rick Perry is wildly unpopular. He needs to get out of our state, and all of them need to. It's a live cancer virus.
[2:19:58.120 --> 2:20:09.120]  Then they say, well, this bill takes away parents' rights. See, that's part of the illusion. They act like they're fighting for your rights, but really they're telling you it takes your rights.
[2:20:09.120 --> 2:20:17.120]  It's a fraud. They don't take your rights. There is no law. If they passed the law, it'd be unconstitutional. It's your body. It's your children's bodies.
[2:20:17.120 --> 2:20:23.120]  Not the state's bodies. Get angry. Get mad. Get out there. Tell the people the truth.
[2:20:23.120 --> 2:20:27.120]  Expose this massive live cancer virus.
[2:20:27.120 --> 2:20:30.120]  Votes will be right back on GCN.
[2:20:30.120 --> 2:20:37.120]  Our terrorist cells are prime terror targets located near you. Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[2:20:37.120 --> 2:20:43.120]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?

[2:21:30.120 --> 2:21:37.120]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[2:21:37.120 --> 2:21:45.120]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising costs of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[2:21:45.120 --> 2:21:53.120]  Is this a flaw for enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[2:21:53.120 --> 2:21:58.120]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[2:21:58.120 --> 2:22:07.120]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power, a gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.

[2:23:38.120 --> 2:23:48.120]  Oh, Jane, I'm sorry to hear that. I have to monitor my blood sugar again. If there was only something natural I could take that would help control my blood sugar, that really works.

[2:24:18.120 --> 2:24:20.120]  So, Jane, what do you think?
[2:24:20.120 --> 2:24:24.120]  I'm going to call sucrablast to set up a free consultation right now.
[2:24:24.120 --> 2:24:27.120]  Excellent, Jane. You'll be glad you did.
[2:24:54.120 --> 2:25:12.120]  Welcome back.
[2:25:12.120 --> 2:25:21.120]  Glad that you joined us. Let me explain this. This legislature, the state house and the state senate, just like the federal, passed the laws.
[2:25:21.120 --> 2:25:30.120]  Then if they're found unconstitutional, the courts can shoot them down. Then the states can come back and override if they want at the state or federal level.
[2:25:30.120 --> 2:25:39.120]  The governor in Texas is the weakest governor in the 50 states because the northern controlled system during reconstruction put in what?
[2:25:39.120 --> 2:25:48.120]  Three different puppets and they ran two of them out at gunpoint. Huge military invasions of the Texas capitol twice to kick them out.
[2:25:48.120 --> 2:25:54.120]  Oh, they don't teach you that in school because they don't want you to know about that, to kick the scallywag carpetbaggers out of here.
[2:25:54.120 --> 2:25:58.120]  And it's the exact same thing today.
[2:25:58.120 --> 2:26:05.120]  And Rick Perry, because he came to the legislature to pass it and they admitted, why'd you have to pass it to begin with? Because you've got to have a law.
[2:26:05.120 --> 2:26:10.120]  And by the way, that law would have been found unconstitutional because you can't make people take your vaccines.
[2:26:10.120 --> 2:26:15.120]  You can't make people put stuff in their body. You'd love to have that precedent set though.
[2:26:15.120 --> 2:26:21.120]  So he comes out with a grand hoax. It's the law. You've got to take it. It's for the children.
[2:26:21.120 --> 2:26:24.120]  You've got to do it.
[2:26:24.120 --> 2:26:32.120]  And then the Associated Press says, we don't know if he has that power because you weren't taught that in school. You call yourself a journalist.
[2:26:32.120 --> 2:26:39.120]  Of course, he doesn't have that power. The state health department is ordered by him to add it to the list of recommended.
[2:26:39.120 --> 2:26:46.120]  They call it mandatory in a fraud, in a hoax, in extortion, in racketeering.
[2:26:46.120 --> 2:26:53.120]  And then they tell the schools that when it's the health department implementing the state laws, but see, that's what government's done.
[2:26:53.120 --> 2:26:58.120]  They don't like laws because they aren't as draconian as they like in most cases.
[2:26:58.120 --> 2:27:02.120]  So it's now policy. The bureaucracy.
[2:27:02.120 --> 2:27:13.120]  The state police policy said until 2001 they could randomly stop you and search you at checkpoints until a bunch of lawsuits got filed and now you stopped your little policy.
[2:27:13.120 --> 2:27:18.120]  Your policies from the governor mean nothing. Your policies from the state police mean nothing.
[2:27:18.120 --> 2:27:25.120]  Your federal policies are a bunch of baloney and they circumvent the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[2:27:25.120 --> 2:27:32.120]  And folks, you start putting up with this. It will be forced inoculations with live mutated cancer virus.
[2:27:32.120 --> 2:27:39.120]  Just like most of your hot dogs and meats now are being sprayed with live virus. Told you about that. It's now happening.
[2:27:39.120 --> 2:27:46.120]  Bacteria eating virus, which then has all these mutation problems. They're radiating most of the meat now.
[2:27:46.120 --> 2:27:49.120]  They didn't ask you. They just did it.
[2:27:49.120 --> 2:27:55.120]  They put thousands of different types of petrochemicals in most of the processed foods. It's horrible for your body.
[2:27:55.120 --> 2:27:59.120]  They just do it. They just do it.
[2:27:59.120 --> 2:28:04.120]  So you know what? Out there, parents, I know most of you, I'm not able to reach most people.
[2:28:04.120 --> 2:28:11.120]  We got a lot of AM and FM affiliates, shortwave internet satellite, but that's why I love getting new affiliates.
[2:28:11.120 --> 2:28:19.120]  That's why I love it when you tell people about the show or about infowars.com or presentplanet.com because I desperately want to warn people.
[2:28:19.120 --> 2:28:27.120]  I just want to be able to reach people. I want to reach people so bad I start shooting my mouth off at Home Depot or at 7-Eleven or on the street.
[2:28:27.120 --> 2:28:31.120]  I start shooting my mouth off at the gym sometimes because I can't help it.
[2:28:31.120 --> 2:28:39.120]  I want to warn people about how they're sterilizing and implanting cancer in people and how we have their documents and how this is part of a larger program.
[2:28:39.120 --> 2:28:43.120]  It's bad enough they're claiming there's a law that doesn't exist. It's bad enough they're taking Merck money.
[2:28:43.120 --> 2:28:46.120]  It's bad enough they're circumventing the legislature illegally.
[2:28:46.120 --> 2:28:49.120]  But in truth, it's a huge eugenics program.
[2:28:49.120 --> 2:28:54.120]  And we can prove that. We have proven that. And it's so scary, a lot of people can't deal with it.
[2:28:54.120 --> 2:29:03.120]  You mean the government and the World Health Organization and the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration with knowing we try to sterilize our little girls?
[2:29:03.120 --> 2:29:09.120]  You notice they could give this vaccine to men and knock out the virus in them so they couldn't spread it.
[2:29:09.120 --> 2:29:16.120]  But it's for girls. And what's it doing? It's sterilizing them. That's some of the side effects now in just a few months of it being given.
[2:29:16.120 --> 2:29:19.120]  I mean they bleed out and their uterus is shot.
[2:29:19.120 --> 2:29:23.120]  And what was it? In Latin America, Africa and India and Asia?
[2:29:23.120 --> 2:29:36.120]  Remember it came out in 95 all over the far and press, BBC. They caught the UN adding an extremely expensive female synthetic hormone in over 100 different manufacturers.
[2:29:36.120 --> 2:29:41.120]  That's how the UN pays off the countries. They have their manufacturers make it as a payoff to the government.
[2:29:41.120 --> 2:29:52.120]  And a very expensive female hormone is added bonded to the tetanus shot so the body then attacks that female hormone when it's produced seeing it as a pathogen.
[2:29:52.120 --> 2:29:57.120]  A very expensive, sophisticated process sterilized hundreds of millions.
[2:29:57.120 --> 2:30:04.120]  So don't listen to me. You just go ahead and you just line your kids up and you just give it to them.
[2:30:04.120 --> 2:30:12.120]  And when your daughter dies at 25 of cancer, just remember. Or maybe you should bleed out right there on the spot and the media won't pick up your story.
[2:30:12.120 --> 2:30:20.120]  Go ahead and kill your little girls. Go ahead you scum.
[2:30:20.120 --> 2:30:30.120]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[2:30:35.120 --> 2:30:39.120]  Providing for our own food, water and power are a good start.
[2:30:39.120 --> 2:30:46.120]  As you may have heard by now, Ken Solar has been configuring alternative energy packages for over a decade.

[2:31:30.120 --> 2:31:35.120]  We at the Bible says, want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[2:31:35.120 --> 2:31:41.120]  Soon it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise. The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[2:31:41.120 --> 2:31:46.120]  The real issue behind this is the Union of Church and State nullifying our First Amendment.
[2:31:46.120 --> 2:31:52.120]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[2:31:52.120 --> 2:31:58.120]  In 2005, President Bush signed the Real ID Act, which goes into effect May 11th, 2008.
[2:31:58.120 --> 2:32:03.120]  Many people believe that this will be the Mark of the Beast because of the restrictive measures included,
[2:32:03.120 --> 2:32:07.120]  which seems to parallel the no buying and selling of Revelation 13-17.
[2:32:07.120 --> 2:32:11.120]  In Revelation 14-9, speaking of the Mark of the Beast, it says,
[2:32:11.120 --> 2:32:16.120]  If any man worship the beast, take notice. It says, worship the beast.
[2:32:16.120 --> 2:32:19.120]  This issue is about worship, not economics.
[2:32:19.120 --> 2:32:24.120]  For a better understanding of this very important topic and to receive your three free books and a free DVD,
[2:32:24.120 --> 2:32:30.120]  call 1-888-211-1715. That's 1-888-211-1715.

[2:32:50.120 --> 2:32:54.120]  You would need almost 20 pounds of alfalfa, 10 pounds of spirulina,
[2:32:54.120 --> 2:33:02.120]  and 40 pounds of wheat to get the same nutritional value found in only one pound of walker's exclusive blend of sea plants.
[2:33:02.120 --> 2:33:07.120]  Over 75 years of experience has made walkers the leader in sea vegetation nutrition.

[2:33:49.120 --> 2:33:52.120]  Now I'm going to play this five-minute clip of a rant on the nature of evil.
[2:33:52.120 --> 2:33:54.120]  Then we're going to go to your calls. Everybody stay with us.
[2:33:54.120 --> 2:34:20.120]  Here he is, Paris. What would you do?
[2:34:20.120 --> 2:34:46.120]  What would you do?
[2:34:46.120 --> 2:35:15.120]  What would you do?
[2:35:15.120 --> 2:35:35.120]  What would you do?
[2:35:35.120 --> 2:36:04.120]  What would you do?
[2:36:04.120 --> 2:36:30.120]  What would you do?
[2:36:30.120 --> 2:36:59.120]  What would you do?
[2:36:59.120 --> 2:37:28.120]  What would you do?
[2:37:28.120 --> 2:37:47.120]  What would you do?
[2:37:47.120 --> 2:37:52.120]  It comes down to that. My basic spirit, my basic instincts is to warn people.
[2:37:52.120 --> 2:37:54.120]  Stand up against evil. It's nothing special.
[2:37:54.120 --> 2:37:58.120]  You can tell Paris has that same view. That's our King's English remix.
[2:37:58.120 --> 2:38:01.120]  Great artist, which he wouldn't add. Some of the stuff we had to cut out there.
[2:38:01.120 --> 2:38:04.120]  But for radio, we made it palatable. Just amazing.
[2:38:04.120 --> 2:38:07.120]  And that thing does play for a few days. I think it's played a little too much.
[2:38:07.120 --> 2:38:11.120]  So let's take out a rotation and save it as a tree every once in a while.
[2:38:11.120 --> 2:38:13.120]  Let's go ahead and go to this clip.
[2:38:13.120 --> 2:38:17.120]  The ultimate synthesis of evil is what it was called. It got posted up on YouTube.
[2:38:17.120 --> 2:38:21.120]  I appreciate the folks that are out there doing that, taking the best little clips of the show.
[2:38:21.120 --> 2:38:24.120]  This ties into the vaccines, all of it, and their mindset.
[2:38:24.120 --> 2:38:29.120]  And just like Paris just said, don't forget they gave us AIDS and leptis.
[2:38:29.120 --> 2:38:33.120]  They do it to everybody, folks, and the police, military, all of you that serve this beast system.
[2:38:33.120 --> 2:38:39.120]  They do it to you and your children, too. They hate you just as much as they hate me. Here it is.
[2:38:39.120 --> 2:38:44.120]  It's important to talk about the globalist master plan.
[2:38:44.120 --> 2:38:50.120]  And then walk through just a few examples of how they're bringing it all together and their mindset.
[2:38:50.120 --> 2:38:57.120]  What makes them tick? Throughout history, throughout human interaction,
[2:38:57.120 --> 2:39:04.120]  people who are willing to be abusive and who are willing to dominate and who are willing to be ruthless
[2:39:04.120 --> 2:39:10.120]  have always had an edge when it comes to getting into positions of power over the tribe.
[2:39:10.120 --> 2:39:16.120]  That's just the facts of life. That's the way it works.
[2:39:16.120 --> 2:39:23.120]  And then you get into a competition of the ruthless, of the cunning.
[2:39:23.120 --> 2:39:26.120]  And then you get societies of the ruthless and the cunning.
[2:39:26.120 --> 2:39:29.120]  And they develop it to a state-of-the-art art form.
[2:39:29.120 --> 2:39:33.120]  And they become entrenched. And then they become inbred and insane.
[2:39:33.120 --> 2:39:37.120]  And then they become more and more decadent.
[2:39:37.120 --> 2:39:40.120]  And for people that can't believe this, look at history.
[2:39:40.120 --> 2:39:49.120]  Look at the barbarism, the Aztecs on certain holidays would sacrifice 10,000 people.
[2:39:49.120 --> 2:39:52.120]  That's what Mel Gibson's Apocalypse is about.
[2:39:52.120 --> 2:39:57.120]  Just insane blood-drinking feasts.
[2:39:57.120 --> 2:40:03.120]  People happily so brainwashed by cultural brainwashing, giving their small children up
[2:40:03.120 --> 2:40:06.120]  so that the high priest could cut their baby's hearts out.
[2:40:06.120 --> 2:40:12.120]  Mass hallucinations. Mass drugging.
[2:40:12.120 --> 2:40:17.120]  The priest class denouncing everyone running around in mad power trips.
[2:40:17.120 --> 2:40:22.120]  The Romans in their declines. The Babylonians.
[2:40:22.120 --> 2:40:27.120]  Even in the more genteel forms of it, the Japanese who would exercise power.
[2:40:27.120 --> 2:40:32.120]  And there are real accounts of where a Japanese samurai would get a new sword.
[2:40:32.120 --> 2:40:37.120]  And he'd want to test it. And he'd go out into the rice paddies and find somebody that didn't bow down properly.
[2:40:37.120 --> 2:40:39.120]  And he'd just cut their head off.
[2:40:39.120 --> 2:40:43.120]  And it was about the exercise of power, the cult of power.
[2:40:43.120 --> 2:40:49.120]  As O'Brien torturing Winston in 1984 says, it's about pressing on the nerve of power.
[2:40:49.120 --> 2:40:53.120]  And they won up each other. It's a reign of terror.
[2:40:53.120 --> 2:41:02.120]  And this is on record during the Red Terror in 1919 when it was really heating up.
[2:41:02.120 --> 2:41:09.120]  One of the commasariats said to Vladimir Lenin, he said, who do we kill? Who do we arrest?
[2:41:09.120 --> 2:41:12.120]  And he said, randomly, just go out.
[2:41:12.120 --> 2:41:18.120]  I'll find the exact quote. He said it a lot more powerfully than I can being demon-possessed.
[2:41:18.120 --> 2:41:27.120]  He said, you know, the nature of it is that it is random. It seeks blood, the red, the red banner of the Red Terror.
[2:41:27.120 --> 2:41:30.120]  It was really cryptic. I'll find that quote.
[2:41:30.120 --> 2:41:38.120]  It's just meant to be just eating its own police, running over its own servants, running over the innocent.
[2:41:38.120 --> 2:41:45.120]  Just bowling around, smashing like an out-of-control juggernaut on huge blood-grinched threads.
[2:41:45.120 --> 2:41:49.120]  That's the nature. Don't you understand that?
[2:41:49.120 --> 2:41:52.120]  And free societies build these limited walls.
[2:41:52.120 --> 2:41:58.120]  And if you run around servicing the walls and watching at the parapets and oiling the gates and, you know,
[2:41:58.120 --> 2:42:02.120]  everything being ready and sharpening your spear and your arrows and your sword,
[2:42:02.120 --> 2:42:08.120]  you might just maybe have some freedom. Maybe. If you fight with everything you've got.
[2:42:08.120 --> 2:42:14.120]  You think you can just stumble around having riots over PlayStation 3's and putting your makeup on for hours
[2:42:14.120 --> 2:42:17.120]  and strutting around with your beer gut at the baseball game.
[2:42:17.120 --> 2:42:22.120]  You think you're going to be free when you don't know anything about our country, anything about the Bill of Rights,
[2:42:22.120 --> 2:42:25.120]  anything about the war machine, anything about how the government works.
[2:42:25.120 --> 2:42:30.120]  You think you're going to be free? Let me tell you something. You're not going to be free. You're going to be a slave.
[2:42:30.120 --> 2:42:34.120]  And let me tell you a little bit about the people that are now running things.
[2:42:34.120 --> 2:42:45.120]  They make Adolf Alois Hitler look like a patron saint. They make Stalin look like a weakling.
[2:42:45.120 --> 2:42:54.120]  They make Mao look like a first grader compared to Nobel Prize winners and quantum mechanics.
[2:42:54.120 --> 2:43:00.120]  The people running things now are the ultimate synthesis of evil.
[2:43:00.120 --> 2:43:11.120]  The ultimate. And you are now seeing the final stages of completion of what turns this planet into a Death Star
[2:43:11.120 --> 2:43:25.120]  and a Death Star that fires on itself, a prison planet, a rendering factory to kill you and your family.
[2:43:25.120 --> 2:43:30.120]  Well, I couldn't say any better myself. And that's exactly what we're dealing with here.
[2:43:30.120 --> 2:43:38.120]  Eugenicists, Nazi types, the Pianca types who want worldwide police state for force reduction of 90%.
[2:43:38.120 --> 2:43:44.120]  And you need to understand their mindset and realize, and then it makes sense to have a governor going,
[2:43:44.120 --> 2:43:49.120]  I just say you must take the live cancer virus. It's so important you take it.
[2:43:49.120 --> 2:43:58.120]  With all the things they've been caught doing with other vaccines here and worldwide, we would be nuts to take anything they push on us.
[2:43:58.120 --> 2:44:05.120]  This is the same federal government under Project Shad that would put our troops and British troops out in the field,
[2:44:05.120 --> 2:44:08.120]  fly over and nerve gas them and drop radiation on them.
[2:44:08.120 --> 2:44:15.120]  It's the same people that would take little children and radiate them or give pregnant wives of GIs, uranium and plutonium pills,
[2:44:15.120 --> 2:44:19.120]  giving them multivitamins just to see what it would do to them.
[2:44:19.120 --> 2:44:23.120]  It's the same people that would march our troops into chambers and claim that they were just going to test something on them
[2:44:23.120 --> 2:44:31.120]  and hit them with nerve gas and kill them and then dissect their body until their family, they die to the flu.
[2:44:31.120 --> 2:44:36.120]  Why did the government do that for 60, 70 years quietly with Tuskegee first, it's the blacks.
[2:44:36.120 --> 2:44:40.120]  Then it's another group. Oh, then it's just the retarded children. Then it's the troops.
[2:44:40.120 --> 2:44:46.120]  Then it's their training cadres of servants that will follow orders and kill innocents.
[2:44:46.120 --> 2:44:48.120]  And now they've built an army of them.
[2:44:48.120 --> 2:44:53.120]  And now they have shows like 24 and all these TV shows that conditioned you that torturing children is good.
[2:44:53.120 --> 2:45:00.120]  And then in the real world, White House councils write memos saying torture children in front of their parents.
[2:45:00.120 --> 2:45:05.120]  We're being bathed in wickedness.
[2:45:05.120 --> 2:45:07.120]  Let's go ahead and take some calls quickly.
[2:45:07.120 --> 2:45:11.120]  Peggy in Pennsylvania, then coffee and others. Go ahead, Peggy.
[2:45:11.120 --> 2:45:19.120]  Alex, a while ago you mentioned in association with the ID Act that I think you said by 2008 to get on an airplane,
[2:45:19.120 --> 2:45:23.120]  you'd have to have a driver's license, which is the ID card. Is that correct?
[2:45:23.120 --> 2:45:25.120]  Well, you already have to have some form of ID to get on an airplane.
[2:45:25.120 --> 2:45:31.120]  But under the real ID Act already implemented now in all 50 states, the National ID Card is what it is.
[2:45:31.120 --> 2:45:38.120]  You'll also have to have a passport to go to Mexico or Canada. And then even if there's no record or no criminal charges or even an APB,
[2:45:38.120 --> 2:45:42.120]  they can put you on a no leave list where you can't leave the country.
[2:45:42.120 --> 2:45:50.120]  Well, let's say that you want to go to Asia and you have a passport but no driver's license. Will that bet you on?
[2:45:50.120 --> 2:45:58.120]  Yes. The real ID Act is to have a job you'll have to have one. Under federal law, you have to show one.
[2:45:58.120 --> 2:46:05.120]  And it's standardized the driver's license to be National ID Cards for the number that then hooks into the database.
[2:46:05.120 --> 2:46:07.120]  Has this passed already?
[2:46:07.120 --> 2:46:15.120]  Yes, this passed in early 2005 and has already been fully implemented. But then they start enforcing it as a law in the beginning of 2008.
[2:46:15.120 --> 2:46:16.120]  I see. Thank you.
[2:46:16.120 --> 2:46:23.120]  Thank you. I appreciate your call. And since you raised this question, this is out of the Associated Press, Lisa Miller today,
[2:46:23.120 --> 2:46:29.120]  State's Challenge National Driver's License. Well, it's also a National ID Card. It was called the Real ID Act.
[2:46:29.120 --> 2:46:35.120]  A revolt against the National Driver's License began in Maine last month as quickly spreading to other states. Hallelujah.
[2:46:35.120 --> 2:46:42.120]  The Maine legislature on January 26 overwhelmingly passed a resolution objecting the Real ID Act of 2005.
[2:46:42.120 --> 2:46:50.120]  The federal law sets a National Standard for Driver's License, NIDs I would add, and requires states to link their record keeping systems and national databases.
[2:46:50.120 --> 2:46:53.120]  And it makes the driver's license be a National Standards, I would add.
[2:46:53.120 --> 2:46:58.120]  Within a week of Maine's action, lawmakers in Georgia, Wyoming, Montana, New Mexico, Vermont...
[2:46:58.120 --> 2:47:00.120]  Oh, I'm really getting happy.
[2:47:00.120 --> 2:47:07.120]  Within a week of Maine's action, lawmakers in Georgia, Wyoming, Montana, New Mexico, Vermont, and Washington State also backed a Real ID.
[2:47:07.120 --> 2:47:09.120]  Bulked at the Real ID.
[2:47:09.120 --> 2:47:15.120]  They are expected to soon pass laws or adopt resolutions declining to participate in the federal identification network.
[2:47:15.120 --> 2:47:26.120]  And you read at SPP.gov. It's really a North American ID. These are the same IDs to be issued to any and all skilled, unskilled workers or anyone here illegally who is allowed to take part.
[2:47:26.120 --> 2:47:32.120]  When you hear guest worker, they're now being legalized through that being given a North American Union ID card.
[2:47:32.120 --> 2:47:35.120]  It's already standardized with Mexico and Canada.
[2:47:35.120 --> 2:47:40.120]  And through UN Agreements with the International ID Card, the next page.
[2:47:40.120 --> 2:47:47.120]  The law supporters say it's a need to prevent terrorist illegal immigrants. No, it's going to legalize them from getting fake identification cards.
[2:47:47.120 --> 2:47:51.120]  States will have to comply by May of 2008 if they do not.
[2:47:51.120 --> 2:47:58.120]  Driver's licenses that fall short of the Real ID standards cannot be used to board an airplane or enter a federal building or open some bank accounts.
[2:47:58.120 --> 2:48:12.120]  So, see, AP reported that illegal aliens are given housing loans, car loans and bank accounts with no ID, but citizens without the federally issued controlled ID, you won't be able to get a bank account, you won't be able to get on planes.
[2:48:12.120 --> 2:48:16.120]  But now the mass suits are going to begin. It's not going to work.
[2:48:16.120 --> 2:48:20.120]  So there you go. And to also have a job, you'll have to show one under federal law.
[2:48:20.120 --> 2:48:32.120]  And again, I saw Governor Ridge in 2002, before he even got Homeland Security legislative funding and power as a new cabinet position, say, you're going to have, if you have bad credit, you'll have a yellow rating.
[2:48:32.120 --> 2:48:35.120]  It's green, yellow, orange and red.
[2:48:35.120 --> 2:48:39.120]  I mean, this is incredible.
[2:48:39.120 --> 2:48:47.120]  Missouri State Representative James Guest for a public and former coalition of lawmakers from 34 states to file bills to oppose or protest Real ID.
[2:48:47.120 --> 2:48:55.120]  This is almost a frontal assault on the freedoms of America, almost when they require us to carry a national ID to monitor where we are.
[2:48:55.120 --> 2:49:05.120]  And it hooks into a database. They're also going to have a national sales tax pushed by phony conservatives that no doubt will pass if they're able to in the name of getting rid of the income tax.
[2:49:05.120 --> 2:49:11.120]  They're only going to change the name of the income tax to your social security tax to FICA.
[2:49:11.120 --> 2:49:24.120]  They're going to lower it down to 10% of them slowly jack it up to. They don't have a national ID card. You will swipe it and then national sales tax will be attached via that and then a portion to the states, counties and cities shared out.
[2:49:24.120 --> 2:49:40.120]  So a whole new federal tax with federal control, a new IRS over every terminal, every shopping cart, every cash register, federal regulators actually in your daily life, which will be deputized local state and county comptrollers and county tax assessors.
[2:49:40.120 --> 2:49:47.120]  I mean, they're billing it as a way to get rid of the income tax. The old Borks really makes me laugh.
[2:49:47.120 --> 2:49:51.120]  And again, Neocons, you won't listen. Go push for it. Get it passed and enjoy it.
[2:49:51.120 --> 2:50:01.120]  And you'll be 10 years from now, you'll be going, yeah, this guy on the radio, should they swipe my card and have national ID and that they keep the income tax and they did. I was conned.
[2:50:01.120 --> 2:50:06.120]  I was conned. It's okay though. You like to be. You won't listen now. It's all right.
[2:50:06.120 --> 2:50:10.120]  Go ahead. Give your daughter the live cancer virus.
[2:50:10.120 --> 2:50:18.120]  Don't listen to me. I'm cuckoo cuckoo. Like the car said, I'm a fruit loop. Sure, I am.
[2:50:18.120 --> 2:50:22.120]  Sure, I just aggressively study 18 hours a day.
[2:50:22.120 --> 2:50:26.120]  Sure, sure. I just know how the new older operates and put out all the evidence.
[2:50:26.120 --> 2:50:36.120]  And I still have emails and arguments that there isn't a national ID card. I'm still, people still cannot believe it.
[2:50:36.120 --> 2:50:43.120]  Oh, man. Heaven help us.
[2:50:43.120 --> 2:50:48.120]  Well, final segment, I'll hit a little bit of our random news and we'll go to, I'm going to blitz through calls.
[2:50:48.120 --> 2:50:59.120]  We'll go to the callers that are patiently holding coffee and then a few others that are holding Matt and Dennis.
[2:50:59.120 --> 2:51:05.120]  Who's in between coffee and Matt? Patrick. I'm going to blitz through coffee, Patrick, Matt and Dennis.
[2:51:05.120 --> 2:51:08.120]  You'll each get one minute. It's a five minute, 15 second segment.
[2:51:08.120 --> 2:51:12.120]  So I'm just going to go bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.
[2:51:12.120 --> 2:51:17.120]  It's just absolutely off the charts. Everything is happening.
[2:51:17.120 --> 2:51:22.120]  The illegal aliens can come and go as they please. The citizens will be totally micromanaged in control.
[2:51:22.120 --> 2:51:30.120]  Because we're the slaps. We're the swabs. We're the dumb idiots. Buy it all.
[2:51:30.120 --> 2:51:37.120]  It's here after a year in production traveling the distant lands.
[2:51:37.120 --> 2:51:39.120]  Mighty Film Terror Storm is complete.
[2:51:39.120 --> 2:51:47.120]  Shocking, declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[2:51:47.120 --> 2:51:55.120]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[2:51:55.120 --> 2:52:07.120]  Terror Storm Chronicles, the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spy, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[2:52:07.120 --> 2:52:13.120]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorists. It's an anthology of government crimes.
[2:52:13.120 --> 2:52:17.120]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[2:52:30.120 --> 2:52:38.120]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[2:52:38.120 --> 2:52:43.120]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.

[2:54:50.120 --> 2:54:58.120]  Let's go ahead and talk to Coffee. Coffee, where are you calling us from?
[2:54:58.120 --> 2:54:59.120]  Calling you from Illinois.
[2:54:59.120 --> 2:55:00.120]  Welcome, sir.
[2:55:00.120 --> 2:55:10.120]  Thank you. When you had the Associated Press reporter on about the vaccines, I hope you added to your list the fact that she said that vaccines like the polio vaccine were a law.
[2:55:10.120 --> 2:55:12.120]  There's no law to compel us to get vaccines.
[2:55:12.120 --> 2:55:17.120]  No, that's my point. They just keep lying and saying it's the law. That's number one. They're criminals.
[2:55:17.120 --> 2:55:22.120]  Both of my kids were born at home and they're not vaccinated. Never will, never have, never will be.
[2:55:22.120 --> 2:55:29.120]  What I was calling you about, though, is you keep bringing up that you've got allergies, and I want to give you just a quick observation.
[2:55:29.120 --> 2:55:38.120]  They salt the roads here where I live, and just huge clouds of salt after they do so, you know, when it dries out and everything.
[2:55:38.120 --> 2:55:43.120]  And I know from old-time remedies, when you've got a wound or you've got a splinter, if you put salt on it, it makes the wound weep.
[2:55:43.120 --> 2:55:47.120]  Now, my nose has been bleeding something awful this year, and I think it's from the salt.
[2:55:47.120 --> 2:55:53.120]  Now, you said that you thought chemtrails and food had something to do with it, which I think that has a lot to do with the long-term diseases.
[2:55:53.120 --> 2:55:57.120]  You know, everything from cancer to that weird Margallan's disease.
[2:55:57.120 --> 2:56:00.120]  The chemtrails has something to do with food.
[2:56:00.120 --> 2:56:01.120]  Almost no time.
[2:56:01.120 --> 2:56:07.120]  Okay, but I think that salt has a lot to do with it, too, and that that they put into the salt, because there's no invisible barrier between the states, my friend.
[2:56:07.120 --> 2:56:13.120]  I hear you, and I appreciate your call. Good call or call me back. We'll have more time. I apologize. I'm having to hurry here.
[2:56:13.120 --> 2:56:15.120]  Patrick in Kentucky, you're on the air.
[2:56:15.120 --> 2:56:32.120]  Hey, Alex. Hey, I believe we need to defend the Dave Von Kleis video in plain sight as Googlevideo.com is blacking it out, and they're only showing part one of it.
[2:56:32.120 --> 2:56:34.120]  And also...
[2:56:34.120 --> 2:56:36.120]  I don't know anything about it.
[2:56:36.120 --> 2:56:40.120]  Okay, well, you know, he needs to defend that because...
[2:56:40.120 --> 2:56:44.120]  Sure, sure. Send me some info on it, or I'll give him a call.
[2:56:44.120 --> 2:57:02.120]  And as far as global warming and depletion of the ozone layer caused by pollution goes, I also believe in the Tesla Skillare weapons and heart technology for melting the polar ice caps and solar flares as a part of the natural cycle and global agenda 21 New World Order.
[2:57:02.120 --> 2:57:03.120]  Sure. Got a job.
[2:57:03.120 --> 2:57:08.120]  Got a job. Who was next? Matt in Canada, go ahead.
[2:57:08.120 --> 2:57:10.120]  Hi, Alex. Pleasure to talk to you.
[2:57:10.120 --> 2:57:19.120]  First off, I became a cuckoo fruit loop five months ago, and ever since then, I've been trying to tell as many people as possible what I find out on the Internet through you and on the radio.
[2:57:19.120 --> 2:57:29.120]  Myself, my wife, and another couple, what we're doing is we're putting together a newsletter up here in Canada, and there's not a lot of talk about real news on the TV.
[2:57:29.120 --> 2:57:34.120]  So we're putting the newsletter together, ranging from GMO to vaccines to current headlines.
[2:57:34.120 --> 2:57:40.120]  I'd like everybody to know, vaccines is your constitutional right to be a conscientious objector to getting any vaccine.
[2:57:40.120 --> 2:57:45.120]  Recently, we had paramedics in Ontario fight and win a case to not get the flu shot.
[2:57:45.120 --> 2:57:50.120]  Exactly. And the medical workers are leading the charge not to take stuff.
[2:57:50.120 --> 2:57:53.120]  Oh, exactly. And they know exactly what's going on with it.
[2:57:53.120 --> 2:57:59.120]  Good caller, I appreciate you. Call me back later and tell me more. Last caller, Dennis, where are you calling from?
[2:57:59.120 --> 2:58:01.120]  That's Denise.
[2:58:01.120 --> 2:58:02.120]  Denise, go ahead.
[2:58:02.120 --> 2:58:03.120]  Minnesota.
[2:58:03.120 --> 2:58:04.120]  OK, go ahead quickly.
[2:58:04.120 --> 2:58:12.120]  I just wanted to say, hey, keep going on the vaccine stuff. It's all nonsense and really, you know, bottom line, it's all about the money.
[2:58:12.120 --> 2:58:15.120]  They're charging over $300 for the vaccine.
[2:58:15.120 --> 2:58:16.120]  Yes, $360 something.
[2:58:16.120 --> 2:58:29.120]  And just another note on that on the view this morning, Rosie Donna brought it up and said she'd be over her dead body before she let anybody inoculate one of her kids and her daughter.
[2:58:29.120 --> 2:58:32.120]  And boy, if that gun grabbers on board, we're saved.
[2:58:32.120 --> 2:58:43.120]  But anyway, and then she also brought up, they did special on autism last week, a full hour of it, and they didn't talk about what was causing autism.
[2:58:43.120 --> 2:58:51.120]  So when she talked about this vaccine, she said, you might want to look into what's causing autism in your vaccine.
[2:58:51.120 --> 2:58:59.120]  People are revolting throughout the entire system. We're going to win with God's help, have faith, believe we can win, and get out and fight those battles.
[2:58:59.120 --> 2:59:01.120]  Good to hear from you. Sorry, we had to rush through your calls.
[2:59:01.120 --> 2:59:10.120]  I'll be back tonight at midnight on the network and, of course, retransmit it over the Internet 24-7. God bless you all.
[2:59:10.120 --> 2:59:18.120]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCN Live.com and reserve it today or call toll-free 877-37645.

[2:59:48.120 --> 3:00:14.120]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions. It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step...
