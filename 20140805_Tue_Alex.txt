[08:38.280 --> 08:42.840]  people calling themselves members of the weather underground last night planted

[09:12.400 --> 09:16.240]  killed and there are reports this morning that most of them are US Navy seals
[09:16.240 --> 09:21.760]  there may be a false flag incident where some ship goes down and you'd be used
[09:21.760 --> 09:25.440]  for the excuse to accelerate the next war but there's one thing that has
[09:25.440 --> 09:30.320]  unified Democrats and Republicans and everybody in between so we all hated the
[09:30.320 --> 09:34.720]  bank bailout the Department of Homeland Security is apparently on a huge ammo
[09:34.720 --> 09:40.680]  buying spree it comes out to like 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition today it
[09:40.680 --> 09:46.080]  is infinitely easier to kill a million people than to control a million they
[09:46.080 --> 09:50.000]  estimated that they would have to eliminate 25 million people in these
[09:50.000 --> 09:53.680]  reeducation centers and when I say eliminate I need to kill I'm here to
[09:53.680 --> 10:00.120]  warn people you keep telling me to shut up this isn't a game from the front lines
[10:00.120 --> 10:06.200]  of the information war it's Alex Jones
[10:06.200 --> 10:16.560]  earlier today a two-star major general was killed at a joint military training
[10:16.560 --> 10:23.240]  base a green blue base where the Afghan army is trained by the US military and
[10:23.240 --> 10:29.120]  other members of NATO who are squatting on top of the opium production
[10:29.120 --> 10:34.840]  operations in the number one opium producing nation in the world Afghanistan
[10:34.840 --> 10:43.760]  US Major General killed an inside of attack at Afghan base and of course our
[10:43.760 --> 10:50.040]  own military is being forced to train not just the Afghan government and
[10:50.040 --> 10:55.760]  military but IS ISIS whatever you want to call it and giving them weapons in the
[10:55.760 --> 11:00.760]  last three and a half years to carry out the murder of over 300,000 men women and
[11:00.760 --> 11:09.720]  children mainly Christians in Syria in our media and Barack Obama and John
[11:09.720 --> 11:12.440]  Kerry and all of them get there indignantly and say we need to launch
[11:12.440 --> 11:17.120]  bigger attacks and our military's credit they've come out and spoken out against
[11:17.120 --> 11:22.600]  it and said no we're not Al Qaeda's Air Force but IS is running all over Africa
[11:22.600 --> 11:27.040]  all over the Middle East all over the place killing people IS is just the new
[11:27.040 --> 11:34.480]  name of Al Qaeda and no one wants to talk about it not the big churches not
[11:34.480 --> 11:43.160]  conservative media not mainline media all anyone will talk about is 60 something
[11:43.160 --> 11:46.720]  dead Israelis and a thousand dead Palestinians I'm sad for both sides
[11:46.720 --> 11:52.000]  tribal warfare intractable it's gonna happen every few years from ever basically
[11:52.000 --> 11:58.840]  forever I just asked the question why am I always directed and why are you
[11:58.840 --> 12:05.320]  directed to only focus on that and to have lots of indignation like the
[12:05.320 --> 12:09.880]  Nicaraguan president has come out and said Netanyahu is possessed by the
[12:09.880 --> 12:22.200]  devil it's this big giant international cause celeb to always side with the
[12:22.200 --> 12:30.560]  Muslims in any way if it's against the West or against Israel in Asia in Latin
[12:30.560 --> 12:37.400]  America the Muslims are seen as the underdog and the public sees things as
[12:37.400 --> 12:46.000]  Germany versus Brazil or Coke versus Pepsi or Chevy versus Ford it's so
[12:46.000 --> 12:50.720]  mindless the globalists are manipulating all the sides not just two sides on
[12:50.720 --> 12:57.880]  record I mean here's a headline out today on info wars dot com from the
[12:57.880 --> 13:01.560]  Washington Times we haven't linked Bill Clinton's coast of a freedom fighters
[13:01.560 --> 13:07.480]  trafficked and body parts when the spoils of war or human organs we knew this back
[13:07.480 --> 13:13.520]  at the time radical al-qaeda connected groups running opium attack Serbia for
[13:13.520 --> 13:17.920]  three years when the Serbs fought back the Democrats bombed the country up one
[13:17.920 --> 13:22.400]  side and down the other Republicans went along with it and they turned over a
[13:22.400 --> 13:28.520]  third of the country to be ethnic cleansed by Muslims against Christians
[13:28.520 --> 13:35.640]  there were no parades in New York City or Austin Texas against it the
[13:35.640 --> 13:41.520]  Nicaraguan president had nothing to say when that happened and I'll tell you why
[13:41.520 --> 13:49.360]  it's because the Albanians were a shade darker than most the Serbs because
[13:49.360 --> 13:53.880]  hundreds of years ago Muslims had repeatedly invaded and successfully
[13:53.880 --> 14:00.920]  taken Albania and not Serbia and they had famous battles in Serbia in
[14:00.920 --> 14:08.120]  Pristina in Kosovo a third of Serbia holding back the Muslims when they were
[14:08.120 --> 14:14.360]  invading Europe and so NATO I guess gave us a gift to Saudi Arabia control of
[14:14.360 --> 14:21.280]  not just Albania but also of Kosovo and they said listen the organs are yours
[14:21.280 --> 14:24.880]  and that's in the news today we knew it back then but it's been declassified that
[14:24.880 --> 14:28.440]  they would just go door-to-door slaughtering everyone with zero coverage
[14:28.440 --> 14:35.360]  so here's the headline Republicans blast dims war on whites we're gonna play
[14:35.360 --> 14:40.520]  that clip coming up later in the hour like we have that clip now
[14:40.520 --> 14:51.640]  but we'll air it as soon as we get it lined up just let me know but that is the issue here
[14:51.640 --> 14:57.840]  that we're talking about is it is a war on Western civilization directed by
[14:57.840 --> 15:03.240]  globalists that run the West because they want to bring everyone down not
[15:03.240 --> 15:07.920]  just the third world whether you're an Eastern European white person or a poor
[15:07.920 --> 15:13.280]  black person or a Latin American they want poverty and control they want to
[15:13.280 --> 15:18.760]  dominate society that's how you control billions of people short of killing
[15:18.760 --> 15:26.080]  them you dumb them down you make them poor you give them false ideologies but
[15:26.080 --> 15:30.480]  Israel blowing up schools blowing up UN facilities blowing up power plants and
[15:30.480 --> 15:39.720]  water treatment in Gaza is a war crime by standard yardsticks and is something
[15:39.720 --> 15:47.920]  that you don't do in a civilian area now Rush Limbaugh famously said the last
[15:47.920 --> 15:55.800]  time they attacked Gaza and I disagreed with him we played the clip here that
[15:55.800 --> 16:00.680]  well of course we carpet bombs cities that's what we did in World War two
[16:00.680 --> 16:08.880]  that's how you bring terror that's how you break an enemy but Iraq didn't even
[16:08.880 --> 16:14.280]  attack us on 9-11 any way you look at it and Iraq but an ally with the US and
[16:14.280 --> 16:18.640]  that we lose the moral high ground by that argument you'd have to agree with
[16:18.640 --> 16:23.320]  people like Ward Churchill who I disagree with who said that the people
[16:23.320 --> 16:27.520]  that flew planes into the World Trade Centers were army soldiers taking out
[16:27.520 --> 16:33.960]  you know people that supported the Nazis basically his attitude was Wall
[16:33.960 --> 16:39.000]  Streets evil and so every secretary in there deserve what they got really you're
[16:39.000 --> 16:42.600]  gonna criticize Ward Churchill for that that's the same thing Rush Limbaugh
[16:42.600 --> 16:55.360]  saying and you lose your humanity when you end up doing that but I don't take
[16:55.360 --> 17:02.680]  a side here because a lot of the Palestinians are connected into groups
[17:02.680 --> 17:08.400]  in fact I'd say around half of them you look at the poll numbers who say that
[17:08.400 --> 17:13.640]  they would exterminate every Christian in the Middle East and I don't even take
[17:13.640 --> 17:19.320]  sides because I'm a Christian it's that wow that's incredibly barbarous and most
[17:19.320 --> 17:23.040]  Palestinians say in polls they would destroy Israel and basically kill
[17:23.040 --> 17:27.440]  everybody that lives there so both sides hate each other both sides are in a
[17:27.440 --> 17:31.600]  death battle both sides are committing atrocities against each other let's be
[17:31.600 --> 17:39.040]  honest like we were space aliens looking down from space and just analyzing
[17:39.040 --> 17:43.520]  what was going on instead of being emotionally sucked into one side or
[17:43.520 --> 17:53.520]  the other our government has funded Saudi Arabia and Qatar Qatar and others to
[17:53.520 --> 17:59.480]  take over areas of Serbia to take over areas of Egypt and then fail to take
[17:59.480 --> 18:06.000]  over areas of Syria and take over areas of Iraq and blow up mosque and blow up
[18:06.000 --> 18:09.680]  churches and crucify people and sexually mutilate hundreds of thousands of
[18:09.680 --> 18:15.160]  women and kill 300 plus thousand and just eat hearts on television and murder
[18:15.160 --> 18:22.880]  whole families and kill non-radical Muslims I mean it is extreme almost zero
[18:22.880 --> 18:29.760]  media coverage and if you say wow Benjamin yet and yahoo is supporting NATO and
[18:29.760 --> 18:33.280]  Saudi Arabia doing this aren't Israelis upset about that
[18:33.280 --> 18:36.960]  Israelis calling it say yeah we're upset about that we don't like that but the
[18:36.960 --> 18:41.360]  average trendy that just says they hate Israel sends me a threatening email
[18:41.360 --> 18:45.840]  saying I hope you die you work for Israel no I don't if I work for who ran
[18:45.840 --> 18:51.200]  Israel I would be supporting the takeover of Iraq by IS Islamic State I'd be
[18:51.200 --> 18:55.840]  supporting the takeover of Syria by IS I'd be supporting what's happening in
[18:55.840 --> 18:59.360]  Gaza instead of sitting back and trying to get people out of tribal
[18:59.360 --> 19:05.400]  mindlessness to see how Israel the Palestinians Saudi Arabia America
[19:05.400 --> 19:10.800]  Germany China Russia we're all being played off against each other people say
[19:10.800 --> 19:16.720]  take a side take NATO side or take Russia side in Ukraine the globalist
[19:16.720 --> 19:20.840]  started the Ukraine war over through the government started attacking Russian
[19:20.840 --> 19:25.680]  held areas where they had bases for hundreds of years Russia responded I'm
[19:25.680 --> 19:31.560]  not endorsing everything Russia does but I don't support starting wars and
[19:31.560 --> 19:36.840]  putting Nazis in control of countries like Ukraine and I've had Ukrainians

[24:22.400 --> 24:26.960]  of his views on his multiple visits to the Arizona border the Texas border you
[24:26.960 --> 24:34.840]  name it the California border just in the last month also coming up huge news
[24:34.840 --> 24:42.160]  on the Ebola front US health authorities concealing number of suspected
[24:42.160 --> 24:51.440]  Ebola victims from the public CNN's doctor Sanjay Gupta at least six tested
[24:51.440 --> 24:57.520]  for Ebola in New York City and our report is up on drudge report dot com it's
[24:57.520 --> 25:02.480]  also obviously on info wars dot com meanwhile there's a new poll out
[25:02.480 --> 25:08.720]  Israelis want to give Obama Ebola for his birthday I'm sure Dr. Eric Bianca
[25:08.720 --> 25:15.800]  probably wants to give 90% of us Ebola so it's ridiculous I can tip last thing I
[25:15.800 --> 25:18.800]  want to something bad to happen to Obama because that would turn him into a
[25:18.800 --> 25:22.280]  martyr and is one of the few things the globalists could do to get their agenda
[25:22.280 --> 25:28.000]  restarted by the way it hit me right before airtime we're really in the
[25:28.000 --> 25:31.360]  beginning of what you call World War four the Pentagon if you look it up
[25:31.360 --> 25:38.080]  considers the last 20 30 years World War three economic war military
[25:38.080 --> 25:44.000]  deployment World War four though though is a mix of proxy wars and economics and
[25:44.000 --> 25:50.720]  hacking and espionage and the globalists have launched World War four
[25:50.720 --> 25:54.800]  they're using the United States to stabilize the planet and again it's not
[25:54.800 --> 26:00.160]  that China or Russia are good their kleptocratic elites just aren't as
[26:00.160 --> 26:04.880]  sophisticated as the globalist and aren't completely eugenics based China is
[26:04.880 --> 26:10.520]  but but Russia isn't and that's their great crime they're just old-fashioned
[26:10.520 --> 26:17.360]  strong men kleptocrats nationalist who do enjoy national pride the globalists
[26:17.360 --> 26:21.080]  absolutely hate this country I want to bring it down so I have to say Putin is
[26:21.080 --> 26:27.080]  a lesser of two evils but nevertheless doesn't matter because he doesn't run our
[26:27.080 --> 26:33.320]  policy it's the globalists that are sitting on top of us another question
[26:33.320 --> 26:38.600]  what will you do if they make it mandatory for all Americans to take an
[26:38.600 --> 26:45.200]  Ebola vaccine that is the question going outcry for the scientific community to
[26:45.200 --> 26:50.000]  do something about the deadly virus over a thousand deaths now and I've got
[26:50.000 --> 26:53.720]  reports saying it's probably much higher Ebola outbreak could lead to gun
[26:53.720 --> 26:59.120]  confiscations martial law the Obama administration is preparing the
[26:59.120 --> 27:03.240]  conditions required for a government declared crisis under those executive
[27:03.240 --> 27:10.000]  orders listed by info wars calm under north com you can be put in forced work
[27:10.000 --> 27:15.760]  brigades gun confiscation seizure of any private property or hoarded food you
[27:15.760 --> 27:21.600]  name it the articles up on info wars calm what I was talking about which we
[27:21.600 --> 27:26.880]  have really some very favorable results on is a vaccine to prevent infection and
[27:26.880 --> 27:30.560]  this would be very relevant to health care providers who put themselves at
[27:30.560 --> 27:34.840]  high risk in taking care of individuals we tested it in monkeys it looks really
[27:34.840 --> 27:39.880]  good it protects monkeys completely from there's an NIH investigator on CBS
[27:39.880 --> 27:45.920]  propaganda news pushing the vaccine vaccine science does work it does have
[27:45.920 --> 27:50.960]  some side effects when done properly still but this is a government combine
[27:50.960 --> 27:55.920]  caught adding stuff to vaccines thousands of times hurting people and
[27:55.920 --> 28:02.640]  killing people so the headline is the u.s. is sitting on promising vaccines oh
[28:02.640 --> 28:08.240]  really is that why a lot of the doctors themselves refuse to take it and they
[28:08.240 --> 28:11.560]  spend it like their heroes for not wanting it it's because they know how
[28:11.560 --> 28:16.840]  dangerous a vaccine is ladies and gentlemen but the media says safe and
[28:16.840 --> 28:21.200]  effective there are no side effects read the insert folks they're lying to you
[28:21.200 --> 28:28.040]  not just of Ebola vaccine any vaccine u.s. health authorities again concealing
[28:28.040 --> 28:32.000]  number of suspected Ebola victims from the public we're gonna be playing some
[28:32.000 --> 28:37.480]  of that report coming up doctors says Ebola outbreak is spinning out of
[28:37.480 --> 28:42.600]  control that CBS news Atlanta Ebola outbreak could be much worse than
[28:42.600 --> 28:47.640]  thought again CBS news also with that headline I tend to agree with that
[28:47.640 --> 28:51.960]  statement if it's over a thousand deaths now that's what we know of it could be
[28:51.960 --> 29:00.160]  much worse Mount Sinai patient tested for Ebola virus in the United States that's
[29:00.160 --> 29:07.080]  being reported by ABC news Saudi Arabia tests suspected citizens of having
[29:07.080 --> 29:13.600]  Ebola Saudi Arabia test man suspected of having Ebola many u.s. hospitals not
[29:13.600 --> 29:19.240]  prepared for Ebola Fox News Atlanta Hospital receives hate mail we talked
[29:19.240 --> 29:24.920]  about that yesterday because they took the Ebola patient or patients the issue
[29:24.920 --> 29:29.240]  is is that they should be in level 4 bio weapon containment facilities that are
[29:29.240 --> 29:34.120]  a lot safer not in mainline University hospitals that have patients down the
[29:34.120 --> 29:40.960]  hall that is reckless abandonment of the public health and a crime the question
[29:40.960 --> 29:45.720]  is why is the establishment doing it plausible deniability comes up first

[34:11.760 --> 34:15.120]  because even the border patrol is taught now how to stick or tell between their

[34:50.120 --> 34:58.000]  that again the democratic party on record was and is the party of the
[34:58.000 --> 35:02.920]  kook luxe clan the nr a was founded to fight the kook luxe clan and arm blacks
[35:02.920 --> 35:11.280]  show the n double acp cnn fox television fox sports espn we played the
[35:11.280 --> 35:16.680]  clips all say the last two years the nr a is the clan the nr a is the clan
[35:16.680 --> 35:21.440]  because it's the opposite saying martin wither king is the clan or denzel
[35:21.440 --> 35:28.680]  washington is the clan or magic johnson is the clan or george washington
[35:28.680 --> 35:34.240]  carver is the clan it's pure absolute 180 degree from reality doesn't matter
[35:34.240 --> 35:37.960]  works very well the public so stupid black white doesn't matter people don't
[35:37.960 --> 35:43.360]  know they're having a home the ground and so now the democrats in the 50s and
[35:43.360 --> 35:46.800]  60s the demographic switch the republicans were passing the civil rights act
[35:46.800 --> 35:51.560]  eyes and hour had troops marching into schools to segregate them the republicans
[35:51.560 --> 35:54.560]  are the ones that ended slavery everybody knew it they looked at
[35:54.560 --> 35:59.680]  demographics with hispanics and blacks voting republican my grandfather got
[35:59.680 --> 36:03.920]  elected office in texas part of the republican wave in the late 50s and they
[36:03.920 --> 36:07.280]  said all right we're gonna go give free stuff to the minorities we'll use our
[36:07.280 --> 36:11.240]  race politics on them not poor whites they'd use poor whites before to control
[36:11.240 --> 36:14.480]  things because they're more poor whites in the country than our rich whites and
[36:14.480 --> 36:17.080]  so you can't tell the republicans were for the upper middle class and rich
[36:17.080 --> 36:20.720]  people but they still didn't like slavery and so the issue was they
[36:20.720 --> 36:24.520]  converted to pure race politics and now they've opened the borders they're
[36:24.520 --> 36:27.840]  gonna bring another hundred million illegals in above the 30 million that's
[36:27.840 --> 36:31.800]  the public plan enough visas to empty three latin american countries into the
[36:31.800 --> 36:37.000]  u.s. nicah ragua el salvador and guatemala the entire populations under
[36:37.000 --> 36:40.360]  obama would move here they will get their free welfare and they will vote to
[36:40.360 --> 36:44.920]  enslave everybody and it will be racially based under raza under race
[36:44.920 --> 36:50.960]  and the democratic party will rule again once more the sith will rule the
[36:50.960 --> 36:56.080]  galaxy and this is so racially based that the nicah raguan president says
[36:56.080 --> 36:59.840]  netanyahu is possessed by the devil and I'm not saying netanyahu doesn't do bad
[36:59.840 --> 37:05.720]  stuff I'm not in that fight the issue is it's purely racially based all over
[37:05.720 --> 37:09.920]  latin america support the palestinians I saw a demonstration this weekend folks
[37:09.920 --> 37:13.960]  with mexican flags and palestinian flags downtown it was on the news there's
[37:13.960 --> 37:18.400]  that you know you got a mustache you've got brown skin like me you know I have
[37:18.400 --> 37:22.160]  solidarity with you and and of course it worked with poor whites in the clan
[37:22.160 --> 37:26.280]  the democrats know what they're doing poor people folks coming from poverty
[37:26.280 --> 37:33.080]  they they get race they get you look like me okay they get raza I want to
[37:33.080 --> 37:38.880]  have a raza of liberty freedom justice family right to self-defense men or men
[37:38.880 --> 37:44.100]  women or women freedom that's the only thing it'll save us is a culture of
[37:44.100 --> 37:49.040]  liberty a culture of quality a culture of entrepreneurship which is very strong
[37:49.040 --> 37:52.000]  in latin america that's why the globalists don't want to go that way
[37:52.000 --> 37:56.960]  they want the bad side of it to go that way the race-based you know people kill
[37:56.960 --> 38:01.760]  each other in football games in brazil against the neighboring country they'll
[38:01.760 --> 38:05.160]  throw hand grenades on the field they'll kill each other over that humans are the
[38:05.160 --> 38:09.720]  same everywhere but they've hyped all this raza stuff up they've made it
[38:09.720 --> 38:15.280]  kosher they've had the spanish media shell infosora la reconquista as the
[38:15.280 --> 38:19.000]  major radio stations and tv stations and it's now happening and the
[38:19.000 --> 38:23.320]  democratic party is planning race war and the eventual breakup of the country
[38:23.320 --> 38:27.200]  under the n a u and the republican leadership is working with them so I
[38:27.200 --> 38:33.160]  wanted to play representative mo brooks of alabama a republican on monday
[38:33.160 --> 38:37.040]  accused democrats of engaging in a war on whites in the current immigration
[38:37.040 --> 38:43.520]  debate i'm gonna play the clip where he went over this but but first off this is
[38:43.520 --> 38:46.720]  the only way to stop the democrats is calling them out for what they're doing
[38:46.720 --> 38:52.600]  yeah it sounds radical to say there's a war on whites there is but it's not even
[38:52.600 --> 38:56.800]  against whites so much as it's politically getting people hyped up to
[38:56.800 --> 39:02.040]  say you don't make a lot of money because the white people or you fell on that
[39:02.040 --> 39:08.920]  banana peel because of white people when the obesity and the diabetes and the
[39:08.920 --> 39:13.560]  cancer and the autism's hitting all of us when most people are intermarrying my
[39:13.560 --> 39:18.040]  god half the kids i see an austin or a white guy with hispanic wife or a
[39:18.040 --> 39:22.320]  hispanic you know man with a wife i mean give me a break folks people are
[39:22.320 --> 39:28.040]  getting along the system is trying to invoke division so we're all fighting
[39:28.040 --> 39:31.520]  with each other while the globalist rule over us that's divide and conquer but
[39:31.520 --> 39:37.960]  it's true that there is a war on whites you know white men can't jump you know
[39:37.960 --> 39:45.040]  blah blah blah it's in all the culture just a constant assault on that and it's
[39:45.040 --> 39:50.960]  being done for a reason because then well obama supposedly part african i don't
[39:50.960 --> 39:56.120]  really see it looks more like he's from the caribbean maybe 10 african but and
[39:56.120 --> 39:59.040]  that's the black folks i talked to i was in the caribbean they're like obama he
[39:59.040 --> 40:05.800]  isn't black but but i mean the whole issue here is that it's about see you
[40:05.800 --> 40:09.640]  can't criticize that it must be good it's a change he's black we'll see next
[40:09.640 --> 40:14.640]  it'll be a woman oh we've got hillary don't criticize her you hate women no i
[40:14.640 --> 40:19.680]  hate tyrants i hate gun grabbers but see it'll now be why don't you like women
[40:19.680 --> 40:23.040]  and i'll have to sit her and explain to women who are like no we're winning we're
[40:23.040 --> 40:26.760]  coming up in the world a woman's president give me a break i'd vote for a
[40:26.760 --> 40:33.840]  woman in half a second if it was a female ron paul a black female ron paul
[40:33.840 --> 40:39.560]  and she could have three arms i'm serious to me in a wheelchair it's about
[40:39.560 --> 40:43.040]  what's in the brain but they don't want that they want it to be about racially
[40:43.040 --> 40:48.640]  based stuff so let's go ahead and go to this clip from the congressman on this
[40:48.640 --> 40:53.720]  issue let's let's um well let's talk about what the what the quote lamestream
[40:53.720 --> 40:58.560]  media is saying about this ron forney a who's been on the show many times off
[40:58.560 --> 41:03.320]  from the national journal was on fox news sunday congressman brooks saying
[41:03.320 --> 41:06.800]  this fastest growing voting block in this country thinks the republican party
[41:06.800 --> 41:10.520]  hates them this party your party cannot be the party of the future beyond
[41:10.520 --> 41:16.880]  november if you're seen as a party of white people your reaction well this is
[41:16.880 --> 41:22.120]  a part of the war on whites that's being launched by the democratic party in the
[41:22.120 --> 41:26.200]  way in which they're launching this war is by claiming that white hate everybody
[41:26.200 --> 41:31.360]  else it's a part of the strategy that brock obama implemented in 2008
[41:31.360 --> 41:36.440]  continued in 2012 where he divides us all on race on sex greed envy class
[41:36.440 --> 41:40.840]  warfare all those kinds of things well that's that that's not true okay and if
[41:40.840 --> 41:48.160]  you look at the polling data every demographic group in america agrees with
[41:48.160 --> 41:54.520]  the rule of law and forcing and securing our borders and every one of them
[41:54.520 --> 41:59.400]  understands that illegal immigration hurts every single demographic group
[41:59.400 --> 42:02.080]  but then making difference if you're white american or black american
[42:02.080 --> 42:06.880]  spanish american and asian american or if you're a woman or a man every single
[42:06.880 --> 42:12.080]  demographic group is hurt by falling wages and lost jobs exactly that's
[42:12.080 --> 42:16.160]  enough full clip i want to try to get him on if we can guys full clips up on
[42:16.160 --> 42:21.440]  info wars.com and drudgereport.com hey let's let's retweet that i know the
[42:21.440 --> 42:24.000]  article we have doesn't even have the full audio let me get that added we
[42:24.000 --> 42:27.920]  usually guys found it to an info or story we'll tweet it out at real alex jones
[42:27.920 --> 42:35.760]  ross perot in 1994 in those debates with that i've reared here from CNN clips of
[42:35.760 --> 42:40.720]  we gotta rear that again i aired a few years ago ross perot in his debate with
[42:40.720 --> 42:45.400]  with al gore was not talking about his panics but they kept bringing up why
[42:45.400 --> 42:49.200]  don't you like mexico why don't you like the mexicans why don't you want them to
[42:49.200 --> 42:52.920]  have nafta and gat and he explained he said nafta and gat will lower their
[42:52.920 --> 42:56.800]  wages in the end he said let me explain this to you larry of course he was
[42:56.800 --> 43:02.520]  proven right but al gore was playing race card again nafta and gat has
[43:02.520 --> 43:08.000]  undercut everything to china for a few years it was better for mexico that's
[43:08.000 --> 43:13.600]  how it works canada opening up their border to the us was good for the us for
[43:13.600 --> 43:18.360]  a few years then hurt us it's it's it's it's a giant sucking sound it's a
[43:18.360 --> 43:22.360]  mathematical equation that drives down the wages and wrecks the quality of
[43:22.360 --> 43:28.000]  society you build up mexico and then jobs will want to go there because it's
[43:28.000 --> 43:33.120]  been built up you don't lower its standards and then that's gonna raise
[43:33.120 --> 43:40.160]  ours it lowers everybody just like they were gonna pass five years ago the
[43:40.160 --> 43:46.040]  global tax on carbon but then the true tax of the copenhagen treaty got leaked
[43:46.040 --> 43:51.040]  and it said double the taxes are right at double on the third world under carbon
[43:51.040 --> 43:54.520]  the globalist had been screwing the third world over over and over again
[43:54.520 --> 43:58.440]  they're the ones that want our guns they're the ones that want open borders
[43:58.440 --> 44:01.840]  they're the ones that say daddy's bad they're the ones that say private
[44:01.840 --> 44:07.000]  properties bad they're the ones that say raise taxes because they're exempt
[44:07.000 --> 44:12.000]  look at this CNBC all Tennessee employment growth since 2000 has gone
[44:12.000 --> 44:18.560]  to immigrants yet natives accounted for 60% of population growth native
[44:18.560 --> 44:24.520]  Americans Hispanic black white if you're born here you're getting hammered by
[44:24.520 --> 44:32.440]  this because the illegals operate in self exclusionary guilds they only
[44:32.440 --> 44:36.720]  operate with themselves in those cases and they're not stupid they shop with
[44:36.720 --> 44:43.160]  each other they operate tribally nobody else does I say operate tribally I'll
[44:43.160 --> 44:48.120]  pull over and buy roadside food from obvious illegals selling watermelons or
[44:48.120 --> 44:52.040]  whatever I did it this weekend or two weekends ago and I'll pull over to old
[44:52.040 --> 44:55.080]  white people and buy it or old black people and buy it you know why I do
[44:55.080 --> 45:00.560]  it's cheaper it's usually better produce and I'm supporting mom and pops just
[45:00.560 --> 45:06.480]  like I buy my coffee from Mexican farmers in Chiapas that have successfully
[45:06.480 --> 45:10.560]  defeated the Mexican government for 30 years trying to take their property only
[45:10.560 --> 45:16.680]  ones that have done it and who produce great coffee I buy it from them to try
[45:16.680 --> 45:20.480]  to build a community it's beyond fair trade and they're building schools and
[45:20.480 --> 45:25.360]  community down there and they used to be leftist they're becoming more free
[45:25.360 --> 45:30.560]  market as they understand true revolution is about commerce I put my money
[45:30.560 --> 45:36.320]  on them out this folks you buy wake up America coffee you're doing that we buy
[45:36.320 --> 45:40.160]  bullet breacher bottle openers from a company owned by a Navy SEAL who's got a
[45:40.160 --> 45:46.240]  bunch of Navy guys and Army guys working for him we sell that made in 1776.com
[45:46.240 --> 45:51.800]  we've got a veteran owned group in Oregon that produces the bronze and
[45:51.800 --> 45:56.640]  nickel belt buckles the mole on LaVan towards Washington listen I try to put
[45:56.640 --> 46:01.160]  them I got a veteran right here we hired he's a great reporter he's a combat
[46:01.160 --> 46:04.720]  vet staff sergeant Joe Biggs retired I want to get into the general in this
[46:04.720 --> 46:08.680]  segment with you but then I want to get into your the intel you got from what
[46:08.680 --> 46:15.520]  happened last night in El Paso with the Spanish run globalist run media trying
[46:15.520 --> 46:19.720]  to cause a big scene with the police standing down but before we get to that
[46:19.720 --> 46:24.440]  Joe your breakdown on what happened with this major general two-star general am
[46:24.440 --> 46:27.680]  I right in saying from is it accurate this is the highest ranking general
[46:27.680 --> 46:32.880]  killed since the Revolutionary War because I know some died in a helicopter
[46:32.880 --> 46:36.920]  crash in Vietnam but that wasn't your case here okay so so this is a big deal
[46:36.920 --> 46:43.200]  yeah this this is huge because this is an actual undercover you know combatant
[46:43.200 --> 46:47.200]  who worked his way through the ranks that's one of the things that you lived
[46:47.200 --> 46:50.120]  in fear of when you were over there a sleeper yeah you didn't know who they
[46:50.120 --> 46:52.800]  were I mean you didn't know if your interpreter was on your side or not
[46:52.800 --> 46:55.760]  because you didn't even speak the language you needed them there to
[46:55.760 --> 46:58.640]  interpret for you what was going on so you can even tell if they're giving you
[46:58.640 --> 47:01.240]  misinformation at the time that's something that you have to live with
[47:01.240 --> 47:04.880]  every day is looking over your back with the people that we're put to work
[47:04.880 --> 47:08.960]  with every day I mean it's something that happened it's dropped but this is
[47:08.960 --> 47:12.800]  huge I mean this is a big blow a two-star general and then the German
[47:12.800 --> 47:16.520]  military loss of one-star general as well or I don't think he's dead yet but
[47:16.520 --> 47:21.160]  he's been seriously injured Asian critical yes so I mean that and this was
[47:21.160 --> 47:24.960]  it one of these controlled camps they call it Green Force Blue Force yeah
[47:24.960 --> 47:29.240]  that's where you work side-by-side left right right or left seat right seat where
[47:29.240 --> 47:33.240]  you work hand-in-hand with the other group and you train them and get them up
[47:33.240 --> 47:39.000]  to speed on your tactics so and then they then they X will trade back and
[47:39.000 --> 47:42.880]  and train the economy network how to counter you yeah pretty much I mean
[47:42.880 --> 47:45.800]  we're training these guys and they go out and they go back to the Taliban or
[47:45.800 --> 47:49.920]  whoever and then they use those tactics and then they use that against us you
[47:49.920 --> 47:53.360]  know under full spectrum dominance for you as a soldier this looks like it's
[47:53.360 --> 47:57.120]  idiocy for the globalists who want to keep the war going you want to just
[47:57.120 --> 48:00.800]  have an excuse to put no bid contracts in and control the opium this is all
[48:00.800 --> 48:05.600]  planned I mean I use I'm not saying I'm not saying they killed the general on
[48:05.600 --> 48:09.120]  purpose yeah I'm saying this is part of the chaos theory go ahead I mean I when
[48:09.120 --> 48:12.160]  people come up to me now and they say you know Joe should I join the
[48:12.160 --> 48:16.120]  military I tell them quite frankly I don't think you should anymore I've lost
[48:16.120 --> 48:19.840]  so much faith in it I don't it's such a corrupt place the people who are running
[48:19.840 --> 48:23.480]  everything and like you said earlier the wars have got in we're killing too much
[48:23.480 --> 48:27.160]  people this stuff has got in remember when the Secretary of Defense Panetta
[48:27.160 --> 48:32.520]  wouldn't ever get around troops even officers who had sidearms oh yeah so so
[48:32.520 --> 48:37.240]  they didn't trust our own troops but I guess they trust the Afghans oh I
[48:37.240 --> 48:39.960]  there's been numerous times high-ranking officials would come to was
[48:39.960 --> 48:44.120]  Balad Air Base in Iraq and one of their first requests would be I think it was
[48:44.120 --> 48:48.320]  Donald Rumsfeld he came out and spoke at Balad Air Base Camp Anaconda and said
[48:48.320 --> 48:52.600]  oh we we want a gathering of soldiers that come over so I can talk but they
[48:52.600 --> 48:55.600]  can't bring their M4s or anything like that of their sidearms and we're like
[48:55.600 --> 49:00.000]  what I'm not gonna go to that I mean meanwhile Saddam Hussein would stand
[49:00.000 --> 49:05.080]  around with 10,000 people firing AK-47s in the air yeah how could he do that but
[49:05.080 --> 49:09.600]  then our leaders are so scared I mean I've never heard of leaders in in in the
[49:09.600 --> 49:13.800]  West since Hitler they wouldn't get around the soldiers armed because they
[49:13.800 --> 49:16.800]  know that the soldiers are the ones who are most informed they see what's going
[49:16.800 --> 49:20.160]  on behind the curtain you know they see that we're out there having the guard
[49:20.160 --> 49:23.880]  opium fields it's ridiculous people are fed up with it and the ones who get out
[49:23.880 --> 49:26.160]  are the ones you're starting the militias and things like that they're
[49:26.160 --> 49:29.760]  tired of all this crap going on the government's not doing their job so
[49:29.760 --> 49:33.720]  people are starting to stand up so you think Rumsfeld and Panetta were smart
[49:33.720 --> 49:38.160]  not to be around the trips um well the thing is it was they've got it they've
[49:38.160 --> 49:42.440]  they've pushed the people such a point that you know when I was asked to
[49:42.440 --> 49:45.560]  attend it I said I would I had nothing to do with it I did not want to be there
[49:45.560 --> 49:49.120]  I said I'd rather go back out on the road and do a convoy I do not want to be
[49:49.120 --> 49:52.960]  around him I mean it's ridiculous you're gonna have me out here in combat and
[49:52.960 --> 49:56.240]  then tell me I can't even have my own weapon in case one of these local
[49:56.240 --> 50:01.520]  nationals you know point a gun and starts firing into us no it's not gonna
[50:01.520 --> 50:03.800]  happen
[50:03.800 --> 50:08.240]  well now the most high-ranking general some are saying ever but there was some
[50:08.240 --> 50:11.520]  high-level generals killed in Revolutionary War highest level ever
[50:11.520 --> 50:16.360]  killed because a war has never been so confused where you've got generals
[50:16.360 --> 50:20.720]  literally right next to the enemy yeah that that right there that's crazy
[50:20.720 --> 50:24.600]  because it was at the the Marshall Faheem National Defense University in
[50:24.600 --> 50:28.200]  Kabul city so there's probably a good bit of high commanding people there in
[50:28.200 --> 50:32.040]  that area that work closely with the Afghan army as well and the local
[50:32.040 --> 50:35.360]  national police and things like that so I mean that's just an accident waiting
[50:35.360 --> 50:39.160]  to happen and it sucks that it did and it's just one of those things that you
[50:39.160 --> 50:43.080]  can't trust and whatsoever you've got to sleep with one eye open well that sounds
[50:43.080 --> 50:47.240]  kind of racist I mean I think we should I think we should bring as many Al Qaeda
[50:47.240 --> 50:50.920]  people as we can into the country to keep us safe I think we're doing that now
[50:50.920 --> 50:54.080]  at the borders aren't we yeah we're gonna come back and talk about that and I'm
[50:54.080 --> 50:58.560]  being sarcastic New York Times we all know who Al Qaeda works for that's the
[50:58.560 --> 51:03.080]  globalist teenagers like me used to think our parents were just weird because
[51:03.080 --> 51:06.280]  they put their phones and computers inside those flimsy little fake leather
[51:06.280 --> 51:10.960]  cases then my folks both got a block at pocket mom knows it keeps her safe from
[51:10.960 --> 51:15.440]  the phone's radiation dad knows it keeps his information private I like my
[51:15.440 --> 51:18.520]  block at pocket because it blocks hacking and tracking awesome
[51:18.520 --> 51:23.240]  block at pocket calm has other cool stuff too huh guess my parents aren't so

[54:09.320 --> 54:14.080]  Joe's about to run down the stand and churning out a meetup with the convoy
[54:14.080 --> 54:19.760]  that started out in California and this ended up being national news on
[54:19.760 --> 54:24.280]  Univision the rest of it when he told me this story and and and he's got a
[54:24.280 --> 54:27.440]  press release from him into a bigger story tonight for the nightly news or for
[54:27.440 --> 54:33.160]  tomorrow's show we're not sure yet this is a false flag clearly where in El Paso
[54:33.160 --> 54:39.640]  a truck then ran the front truck of the convoy off a ramp with Univision
[54:39.640 --> 54:44.800]  waiting and the police coming in saying a a a gun thread had been called in on
[54:44.800 --> 54:51.480]  the convoy so all of it coordinated as they came in I guess trying to get
[54:51.480 --> 54:56.560]  something on video or to get the convoy to react this is pretty amazing stuff
[54:56.560 --> 55:00.040]  ladies and gentlemen this is stuff that's going on that's only on the Spanish
[55:00.040 --> 55:05.720]  media because American citizens dared try to drive in their cars across the
[55:05.720 --> 55:09.560]  Southwest to point this out you don't do that just like Mexican citizens don't
[55:09.560 --> 55:13.840]  do that or they get killed we're being taught just like Texas newspapers have
[55:13.840 --> 55:17.600]  closed on the border because they've been rocket attacked in the last five years
[55:17.600 --> 55:23.760]  Americans need to learn to sit down and shut up and lay down a third world
[55:23.760 --> 55:28.840]  countries that have failed because that's what America's all about Joe Biggs
[55:28.840 --> 55:33.760]  tell us about what's been unfolding so the convoy was heading east on I-10 and
[55:33.760 --> 55:37.280]  they said they noticed spotters up on the mountains in the overpasses
[55:37.280 --> 55:42.440]  shortly thereafter a vehicle a swerve I think they said it was like a Tahoe swerve
[55:42.440 --> 55:47.000]  at their lead vehicle taking them off of the ramp and down the side road where
[55:47.000 --> 55:50.960]  there was protesters waiting see I'd have just taken it boom
[55:50.960 --> 55:56.200]  of course that's guess that's sorry I'm not getting anyways so they get down
[55:56.200 --> 56:00.440]  there and Univision's reporting and then within seconds they said police
[56:00.440 --> 56:04.600]  started coming in what happened was the protesters called in but prior to the
[56:04.600 --> 56:08.080]  convoy even being there that someone in the convoy had pulled out a gun and
[56:08.080 --> 56:13.000]  pointed at someone so the police is reacting to what they think is you know
[56:13.000 --> 56:16.640]  some kind of that's all a shut up yeah so so they get there and they're like
[56:16.640 --> 56:19.240]  alright what's going on what's going on and they're like well what do you mean
[56:19.240 --> 56:23.680]  you know we were driving down the road a vehicle swerved at us and made us go
[56:23.680 --> 56:29.560]  off the road it backed up I-10 for up to an hour on an El Paso you know do and
[56:29.560 --> 56:33.240]  I were just there not too long ago I've been there a few times a past month I-10
[56:33.240 --> 56:39.080]  in El Paso is five lanes east to west on both and it shows how crazy it is
[56:39.080 --> 56:42.880]  imagine if we were in Mexico saying open your borders up give us everything
[56:42.880 --> 56:48.240]  free they'd laugh at us if we just dare want to do anything we're evil we're
[56:48.240 --> 56:52.200]  bad and and it's in the news that that that the pro immigrant groups were
[56:52.200 --> 56:55.920]  pointing guns at people I mean this is going to explode which is what Obama
[56:55.920 --> 57:00.360]  wants you on their website border convoy.com they actually have hate mail
[57:00.360 --> 57:03.840]  coming in from people and the locals there and when they got on the website
[57:03.840 --> 57:07.400]  they found one of the people who wrote something and they were taking pictures
[57:07.400 --> 57:12.120]  you know live from the overpass in the mountains as the convoy approached saying
[57:12.120 --> 57:17.080]  it's go time so to warn everybody to get ready for this so they lured them into
[57:17.080 --> 57:20.960]  this it was a huge setup you know long story short please escort them out of
[57:20.960 --> 57:23.320]  there they're like all right you guys got to get out of here so they have going
[57:23.320 --> 57:28.160]  to some hotel I think in Van Horn stayed over 4 30 in the morning they get
[57:28.160 --> 57:32.720]  woken up not knowing what's going on our militia are banging on the doors you
[57:32.720 --> 57:38.120]  know m16s m4 ski mask on saying hey the cartels are on the way you need to get

[57:44.840 --> 57:48.800]  with standoffs with the feds and guns all this stuff many times before on record
[57:48.800 --> 57:52.760]  I'm sorry I'm just not leaving I mean if people want to say you can't be in a
[57:52.760 --> 57:56.240]  hotel I'm not saying those militias are psi off but obviously there's going to
[57:56.240 --> 57:59.640]  be infiltration in the convoy psi off manipulation aren't saying they're even
[57:59.640 --> 58:04.440]  bad they can be fed false information why panic everyone and get up and run

[58:09.080 --> 58:12.120]  it and understand it Joe I don't know but you know you got to think one of

[58:22.000 --> 58:25.800]  militia in those masks I think it's psi off management of people's what's going
[58:25.800 --> 58:30.640]  on here I mean clearly the Mexican media the Spanish-speaking media it's all
[58:30.640 --> 58:34.800]  drug cartel owned it's all running a giant psi off I'm saying it's linked up

[01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:09.120]  ease the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:24.200]  you know when I was about eight nine years old and Mexico wasn't one-tenth
[01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:29.600]  as violent as it is now I remember my dad rented a Volkswagen with my mom and I
[01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:35.120]  we flew into Cancun snorkeled in a few days they went diving and then we would
[01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:40.680]  drive down into the countryside into the Yucatan Peninsula deeper and go visit
[01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:44.760]  things on the inland but also on the coast I'll never forget how angry I was
[01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:53.960]  by a textbook corrupt cop potbelly gold teeth whole nine yards just like you can
[01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:58.120]  have the textbook hillbilly cop in East Texas robbing people you know that
[01:08:58.120 --> 01:09:04.240]  drive through the town potbelly gold teeth same deal potbelly gold teeth
[01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:07.760]  demanding money off my dad or threatening to take us to jail for no
[01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:13.360]  reason and then the last time I was in Mexico four years ago the bus driver they
[01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:18.760]  they knew to ask for tips after they'd also given us tours of some pyramids and
[01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:22.960]  then the bus driver's gotten part of those tips maybe a hundred dollars off
[01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:27.360]  the big huge bus full of you know however many people and the Mexican
[01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:31.120]  military pulled up with machine guns stopped them took them off took his
[01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:35.680]  money and he'd been doing tours all day this was at like five o'clock the
[01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:40.160]  tours were like three hours long we're probably his third tour and they took his
[01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:45.680]  money and the guy was crying driving back so see it's not a hatred of
[01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:50.400]  Mexicans themselves it's a hatred of third-world countries and the corrupt
[01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:55.840]  governments I hate the Chinese Communist I hate the North Korean criminals I
[01:09:55.840 --> 01:10:03.560]  hate Hitler I hate Stalin I hate Mao I hate oppressors that do this type of
[01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:07.680]  thing and I don't want to be like that and I get so angry to hear about Mexican
[01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:11.280]  cartels shooting at the border patrol and they're told to run now they can't
[01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:15.520]  have bullets that's in the niche they won't give them bullets the government's
[01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:20.800]  training to take on the American people and to hear about cartels 50 miles from
[01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:24.880]  the border stalking the hotel of the convoy bringing attention to the border
[01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:30.960]  and then everyone basically fleeing from it it makes me want to throw up and I
[01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:35.080]  was talking to Joe Biggs here retired staff sergeant you know he's not bragging
[01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:38.200]  but his exploits have been written about in Esquire and other publications you
[01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:41.320]  know you've taken on a lot of people including in hand-to-hand and you know
[01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:45.000]  successfully that's why I can't go to these type of things because I'm not a
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:48.920]  tough guy but I am primitive and I would just flip out if people are coming at
[01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:54.840]  me with guns I mean it's it's it's not a good deal and well I mean what would you
[01:10:54.840 --> 01:10:58.040]  have done if you were in that hotel and there was Mexican cartel across the
[01:10:58.040 --> 01:11:00.880]  street pointing guns at you and the cops aren't going to help you because
[01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:05.160]  American police are trained to do one thing give old ladies tickets and take
[01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:08.960]  kids for CPS so CPS can gang rape them I mean basically that's about what our
[01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:12.960]  police do these days a lot of them I'm not all of them but a lot of them in big
[01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:16.080]  cities I mean what would you have done if you were there last night because you
[01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:19.560]  were almost part of that convoy get the women out of there as soon as possible
[01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:23.400]  and then go out and set up a recon and check out what's going on to see if
[01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:26.400]  someone's out there but that's just me you know from the training I and what
[01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:29.640]  would you have done if there were foreign drug cartel people with guns I
[01:11:29.640 --> 01:11:33.000]  mean obviously I don't have guns but I was trying to you know get ahold of
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:36.400]  police or something like that send out some reports and give them some kind of
[01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:40.120]  intel as a matter of people we could see what they're carrying so they have an
[01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:44.600]  updated intel report on that situation I mean that's the only way that you could
[01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:47.400]  actually get anything done I mean if I if I don't have a gun there's nothing I
[01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:51.560]  can do with 10 15 or men this country keeps groveling to these cartels we're
[01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:56.640]  done we already bend over to the TSA and every other thug I'm just sick of all
[01:11:56.640 --> 01:12:00.360]  of them I'm sick of it yeah they try to bull everybody around I mean that
[01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:05.920]  anybody who's bringing anything to the anti-amnesty side of it the people they
[01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:09.920]  don't want the the legals coming in illegally you know that that stops their
[01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:13.400]  their human smuggling operation they don't like that and they're and it's
[01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:17.640]  crazy they're coming into our country and they're pushing people around to do
[01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:21.600]  that and you know the board patrols backing down the police are just kind of
[01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:26.240]  like I don't want anything to do with it I mean it's like the police won't mess
[01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:31.520]  with real motorcycle gangs on record in Texas and it's the exact same thing I
[01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:34.520]  mean I don't care if it's a motorcycle gang that struts around front of your
[01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:37.520]  family saying get out of their way I mean I'm not saying I'm a tough guy but
[01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:41.360]  I'm like listen you ready to go right now I'm done I'm not giving money to
[01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:45.720]  Mexican police I'm not bending over to cartels I'm not bending over to motorcycle
[01:12:45.720 --> 01:12:50.680]  gangs I'm not bending over to thug cops I'm not bending over to the TSA none of
[01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:55.000]  them I'm done with all of them I mean can't we find our American spirit again
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:13:00.280]  a nation of people that bend over folks get gang raped stop acting like cowards
[01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:04.880]  exactly so I salute the folks in the convoy and the good militia that's
[01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:07.840]  involved with them I'm sure they're good I'm just saying from what I've been
[01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:12.560]  with you know what I've seen what I've witnessed and the groups I've been
[01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:17.040]  around and been with I have just seen so much stuff that it's just look at our
[01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:20.320]  homeland security set again this week number one threats gun owners veterans
[01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:24.320]  tea party they don't use humet and intelligence officers against the drug
[01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:27.920]  cartels and the real stuff that they're messing with us brother because they
[01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:32.280]  know we want freedom exactly they know we've had enough of it we have the
[01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:35.200]  training we're tired of being pushed around you have the training brother

[01:13:55.720 --> 01:14:00.280]  it's just that I can't be pushed anymore and I know you can't be pushed anymore
[01:14:00.280 --> 01:14:03.360]  and I personally have had enough I'll tell you who else can't be pushed
[01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:09.800]  anymore I see something is the headline and the sub-headline is Marine
[01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:15.480]  Colonel warns of takeover he says go get your horned hat and take back the ship
[01:14:15.480 --> 01:14:25.320]  and that is award-winning as well as Ron Star or whatever it is Patriot
[01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:31.040]  Colonel Pete Martino US Marine Corps Colonel retired who last year spoke out
[01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:35.120]  about about the whole New World Order system and the prepositioning of weapons
[01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:40.040]  we're gonna air the entire 45-minute interview in overdrive today in the
[01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:45.120]  fourth hour the full video interview is now upon info wars.com we just sent the
[01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:49.680]  video out on Twitter at real Alex Jones again it's called I see something
[01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:55.240]  Marine Colonel warns of takeover the video is titled retired Marine Colonel
[01:14:55.240 --> 01:15:00.640]  DHS is preparing for war with America and that bringing in the foreign groups
[01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:05.320]  to destabilize as part of asymmetrical warfare and you have that from the head
[01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:10.480]  of the Border Patrol Union this is a military attack pointed at anybody that
[01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:14.000]  isn't a criminal and if you don't pay attention to this you're nuts here's
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:18.320]  part of the report that's coming up the reason so many people in the world want
[01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:22.600]  to kill us is because we need to pay attention on what's going on in our own
[01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:27.520]  house and when it comes to these bear cats and this issue to be honest with
[01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:31.440]  you I really don't have a problem with the police having bear cats if it's to
[01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:35.680]  keep me safe and to keep the police officers safe in fact I know about a
[01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:39.280]  dozen police officers personally in New Hampshire who if they were the ones
[01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:43.080]  holding the key they could park it in my driveway and I'd sleep better at night
[01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:47.440]  but the reality is I don't know all the people who have the keys to those bear
[01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:52.000]  cats and the thing that concerned me in Concord last year was that the chief of
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:57.240]  police justified on his grant application for that bear cat as one of
[01:15:57.240 --> 01:16:01.160]  the reasons was to deal with the daily challenges of the Free State Project
[01:16:01.160 --> 01:16:06.600]  now the Free State Project is just a group of Liberty minded individuals
[01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:11.920]  activists were trying to get 20,000 people activists to move to New Hampshire
[01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:16.560]  because it's a small state and try to restore liberty there and return to
[01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:21.080]  constitutional government we're building a domestic military because it's
[01:16:21.080 --> 01:16:26.320]  unlawful unconstitutional to use American troops on American soil so what
[01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:30.360]  we're doing is we're building a military my best friend who's a SWAT
[01:16:30.360 --> 01:16:35.560]  officer in Nashua who came to Iraq with me train the Iraqi police sent me an
[01:16:35.560 --> 01:16:39.560]  email with a picture of him in the media on the streets of Watertown mass
[01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:44.200]  wearing the exact same combat gear that we had in Iraq only it was a different
[01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:49.040]  color I'm shocked that nobody at the IRS has come forward somebody sat next to
[01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:53.080]  lowest learner somebody in some of these agencies was in the next cubicle and
[01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:56.240]  knew what was going on and still knows what's going on and yet you don't
[01:16:56.240 --> 01:16:59.400]  see people coming forward and talking about it so when you work for a
[01:16:59.400 --> 01:17:04.080]  government agency and people start broad brushing that agency and talking
[01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:07.840]  about it they're talking about you same thing with our country when people say
[01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:11.480]  negative things about the United States or they want to kill us or whatever
[01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:15.600]  they're talking about you and me the United States isn't some piece of dirt
[01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:20.480]  it's not some monuments some building it's you and me it's us it's we the people
[01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:23.960]  that's why I do what I do is I don't want it my name exactly and so where are the
[01:17:23.960 --> 01:17:27.600]  people in these agencies you know that where's the embarrassment where's the
[01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:32.280]  shame where's the the sense of conscience to go out there and speak up and
[01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:35.680]  say something and a lot of people are afraid of retaliation or losing their
[01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:39.160]  job we'll go get another job you know here we are being told that the NSA
[01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:42.440]  needs to turn the whole planet into the Truman show and we're all Truman and
[01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:46.720]  yet at the same time we've got people walking across the border you know
[01:17:46.720 --> 01:17:51.920]  without any ID just being shipped all over the country borders wide open but
[01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:56.800]  Homeland Security is for veterans tea party gun owners libertarians taking the
[01:17:56.800 --> 01:18:01.000]  first letter of each word integrity commitment advocacy respect and
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:06.760]  excellence creates a powerful acronym I care come on why aren't people in
[01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:11.000]  prison right now if anybody gave a damn that we've got over a thousand veterans
[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:16.120]  died because of being ignored secret death list yeah and so meanwhile though
[01:18:16.120 --> 01:18:21.080]  the president seems to know more about the health care of a prisoner of war on
[01:18:21.080 --> 01:18:25.120]  the other side of the country or on the other side of the world who's been
[01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:29.040]  accused of being a deserter and he couldn't notify Congress and give him
[01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:33.240]  the 30-day notice that by law the law that he signed he was obligated to do
[01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:39.440]  released five known terrorists from Guantanamo Bay which arguably could be
[01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:42.600]  treasoned because it's aiding and abetting the enemy to get this one
[01:18:42.600 --> 01:18:46.520]  soldier back and he couldn't tell anybody about it in Congress because the
[01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:50.360]  health his health was in such dire need there was always back on regular duty
[01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:54.040]  he probably had better health care while he was a prisoner of war we need to
[01:18:54.040 --> 01:18:57.120]  take a closer look of who's representing you these are the people who
[01:18:57.120 --> 01:19:02.880]  represent us around the world the we had an ambassador to Belgium who is an

[01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:24.800]  globe with a fuse burning towards it and that's about right it's not just that
[01:35:24.800 --> 01:35:27.560]  the elite are out of control it's that they don't even know what they're doing
[01:35:27.560 --> 01:35:33.920]  more and more it's kind of like we live in the civilization built by our
[01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:38.240]  ancestors and we even live in the elite system the elite setup of under eugenics
[01:35:38.240 --> 01:35:43.760]  and they kind of projected the future a hundred years ago 80 years ago 60 years
[01:35:43.760 --> 01:35:51.640]  ago 20 years ago but now more and more it's just delusion it's crazy town I
[01:35:51.640 --> 01:35:55.960]  mean our government wouldn't let the trips use DU until 1990 because it's
[01:35:55.960 --> 01:36:00.320]  death sentence they used to care of nuclear reactors were leaking until now
[01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:05.160]  they used to care of drug resistant TV was coming across the border or they
[01:36:05.160 --> 01:36:09.000]  wouldn't fly a bowl of patients into the US in the past that's why it's the
[01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:20.240]  first time because it's a recklessness a crazy recklessness and then we were
[01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:23.120]  playing part of the interview with the Marine Corps Colonel that we're gonna
[01:36:23.120 --> 01:36:28.440]  exclusively premiere in the fourth hour today and he was pointing out all these
[01:36:28.440 --> 01:36:32.160]  people to get caught being pedophiles in government and the government covers
[01:36:32.160 --> 01:36:37.320]  it up meanwhile Google reads all of your email to quote find pedophiles no
[01:36:37.320 --> 01:36:41.080]  they mine all the data and sell it on record and now because they've been
[01:36:41.080 --> 01:36:45.760]  caught doing it they just gave the police some info on pedophiles we read
[01:36:45.760 --> 01:36:51.960]  we read everyone's mail because you're all guilty until proven innocent that's
[01:36:51.960 --> 01:36:56.560]  in the news today Google scans Gmail accounts for child abuse now it's not
[01:36:56.560 --> 01:37:01.360]  just a child porn or something oh if you talk about spanking your kid they're
[01:37:01.360 --> 01:37:06.160]  gonna take them but see how they roll that out oh yeah we are reading
[01:37:06.160 --> 01:37:12.200]  everything you do to stop pedophilia uh-huh with the UN and Dine Corps up
[01:37:12.200 --> 01:37:17.760]  to their eyeballs in it this is what we're really dealing with and we're
[01:37:17.760 --> 01:37:22.240]  dealing with a government that lives in Switzerland lives in Luxembourg lives in
[01:37:22.240 --> 01:37:26.960]  Monte Carlo who've stolen hundreds of millions mid-level billions high level
[01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:32.960]  and their rear guard action is just flood the country break it down implode it
[01:37:32.960 --> 01:37:40.160]  and turn us into one giant Latin American slum and never let those people
[01:37:40.160 --> 01:37:43.760]  have any freedom and have everything be racially based now we'll have a party
[01:37:43.760 --> 01:37:46.760]  of the white people and a party of the Hispanics and a party of the black
[01:37:46.760 --> 01:37:51.440]  people and the police as referee over all of us and America is one giant
[01:37:51.440 --> 01:37:56.000]  prison oh yeah they've been segregating people for decades into their racial
[01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:00.160]  groups and prisons and that's the management model for America but if
[01:38:00.160 --> 01:38:04.200]  you won't play along and segregate yourself into a racial group controlled
[01:38:04.200 --> 01:38:12.280]  by your gang boss who goes and you know plays cards with the warden and your
[01:38:12.280 --> 01:38:17.960]  gang boss that sells you drugs that the money goes back to the warden if you
[01:38:17.960 --> 01:38:22.160]  don't play ball well they've got to infuse racial garbage in the name of
[01:38:22.160 --> 01:38:26.600]  fighting racial division through multiculturalism in all the schools and
[01:38:26.600 --> 01:38:33.600]  in the media I mean if you had white media saying we are for white people and
[01:38:33.600 --> 01:38:37.320]  we will conquer the blacks and Hispanics we are the supreme race they'd be all
[01:38:37.320 --> 01:38:42.160]  the news but when the Spanish media does that it's a okay but it's owned by the
[01:38:42.160 --> 01:38:46.960]  big drug cartels on record it's owned by the big banks it's a shy op folks and
[01:38:46.960 --> 01:38:50.080]  we're here telling you what's happening for the balance of the hour William
[01:38:50.080 --> 01:38:56.600]  Geene who joined us last week of alley pack.com alipack.com will be joining us
[01:38:56.600 --> 01:39:02.760]  they're kind of the gun owners of America for borders they got protest
[01:39:02.760 --> 01:39:06.840]  nationwide yesterday and they're trying to draw attention to what's happening
[01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:12.440]  the polls show this is backfiring even with Hispanics against Obama because
[01:39:12.440 --> 01:39:17.120]  they're not stupid they were gonna have unlimited Guatemalans and Brazilians and
[01:39:17.120 --> 01:39:21.720]  everybody else here because there's so much nationalism between those
[01:39:21.720 --> 01:39:26.000]  countries that finally folks are waking up on the Hispanic end but the
[01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:29.280]  Democrats are just hey if you're brown you're good if you're white you're L
[01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:35.520]  Diablo if you're blackbird they use a racial term for it means my autop sorry
[01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:39.640]  for using it was for documentary terms you're not in the club and so it's again
[01:39:39.640 --> 01:39:44.880]  a giant supermax prison management model and I don't want to live in that I
[01:39:44.880 --> 01:39:48.560]  want to live in a country where we're unified around freedom and prosperity and
[01:39:48.560 --> 01:39:55.400]  and hard work not around the Democratic Party aka founders of the Ku Klux Klan
[01:39:55.400 --> 01:39:59.440]  William Geene thank you for joining us glad to be here Alex and want to just
[01:39:59.440 --> 01:40:03.800]  quickly mention your article about the two illegal aliens that killed a Javier
[01:40:03.800 --> 01:40:08.200]  Vega Jr. our border patrol agent you know I just wanted to mention him because
[01:40:08.200 --> 01:40:12.720]  he was murdered by two illegal aliens in front of his mother and his father and
[01:40:12.720 --> 01:40:17.560]  in a way he's sort of symbolic of all of us that are standing up fighting against
[01:40:17.560 --> 01:40:22.240]  illegal immigration trying to defend our families from the hardship and damages
[01:40:22.240 --> 01:40:25.840]  caused by illegal immigrants and illegal immigration of course not all
[01:40:25.840 --> 01:40:29.400]  illegal immigrants are murderers and I have to say that because of our enemies
[01:40:29.400 --> 01:40:33.680]  that patrol for anything they can grab out of context but I think that a
[01:40:33.680 --> 01:40:37.280]  patrolman Vega you know being killed in front of this family like that shows
[01:40:37.280 --> 01:40:41.840]  exactly you know what the real dangers involves the illegal immigration are and
[01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:46.040]  even after appearing on your show last time to talk about the protest against
[01:40:46.040 --> 01:40:50.200]  illegal immigration and the effort to take Lamar Alexander out of office in
[01:40:50.200 --> 01:40:53.920]  Tennessee I received a lot of death threats online through the George
[01:40:53.920 --> 01:40:58.280]  Soros hate group right-wing watch which apparently is developing a reputation
[01:40:58.280 --> 01:41:04.160]  for generating threats of violence and death against people that did not
[01:41:04.160 --> 01:41:09.000]  agree with their communist agenda oh they've had a big rash of problems
[01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:12.440]  documented in the news the last few months where professors get up at the
[01:41:12.440 --> 01:41:16.200]  start of school and college and say if you're in the Tea Party get out of my
[01:41:16.200 --> 01:41:19.800]  class I'm going to give you a failing grade I want to kill you I want to put
[01:41:19.800 --> 01:41:25.160]  you in a body bag I mean these are not liberals like so many people in the
[01:41:25.160 --> 01:41:31.600]  60s or something this is a deranged gang who just wants total power and I guess
[01:41:31.600 --> 01:41:35.520]  have some fantasy that they're gonna be like Stalinist enforcers well on
[01:41:35.520 --> 01:41:40.920]  Facebook Facebook seems to allow them free reign to do so and Facebook and
[01:41:40.920 --> 01:41:44.520]  Google are both practically extensions of the US government at this point due to
[01:41:44.520 --> 01:41:48.280]  the massive amount of tax breaks they get and the fact that the CEOs of both
[01:41:48.280 --> 01:41:53.360]  are on board with Barack Obama with his immigration reform amnesty plans amongst
[01:41:53.360 --> 01:41:58.760]  other agendas as well as being a part of the surveillance society that they're
[01:41:58.760 --> 01:42:03.040]  now wrapping around every person in this hemisphere so we've got a situation
[01:42:03.040 --> 01:42:06.680]  where the death threats are increasing right when watch had their YouTube
[01:42:06.680 --> 01:42:10.120]  account suspended because of death threats against one of their targets
[01:42:10.120 --> 01:42:15.080]  yesterday we have just this morning we got a report that a convoy of Americans
[01:42:15.080 --> 01:42:19.120]  that are forming a convoy along the Southwest border right now to bring
[01:42:19.120 --> 01:42:24.200]  attention to the border crisis have had to cancel events because of online death
[01:42:24.200 --> 01:42:28.080]  threats so basically groups like hate groups like right wing watch and others
[01:42:28.080 --> 01:42:31.280]  are stirring up death threats against peaceful political and racially
[01:42:31.280 --> 01:42:35.600]  inclusive American national by the way if folks start canceling convoys I'm
[01:42:35.600 --> 01:42:39.760]  gonna have to do one because I mean so what a people death threat we get death
[01:42:39.760 --> 01:42:44.600]  threats all the time I had an event with Jesse Ventura and Willie Nelson it
[01:42:44.600 --> 01:42:48.160]  was Willie's idea wasn't even my plan because I could care less about speaking
[01:42:48.160 --> 01:42:52.800]  to venue at 10,000 people I've done it so many times but he wanted to do it so
[01:42:52.800 --> 01:42:56.360]  we were gonna come speak at the last place at the backyard before they
[01:42:56.360 --> 01:43:01.200]  closed it moved it and they got death threats and the and the head of it said
[01:43:01.200 --> 01:43:05.760]  no you can't speak now because of this and we said fine but then he still got
[01:43:05.760 --> 01:43:10.520]  even more upset I mean it's just like this is literally a nation of cowards
[01:43:10.520 --> 01:43:14.480]  I mean I mean I get death threats all the time I'm not bashing with convoy but
[01:43:14.480 --> 01:43:20.360]  why cancel events because the Hispanic Ku Klux Klan threatens it well you know I
[01:43:20.360 --> 01:43:24.120]  thought the same thing but the truth matter is that's Eric Odum's caravan and
[01:43:24.120 --> 01:43:27.720]  I'm not gonna tell him how to run his show because hey we need everybody out
[01:43:27.720 --> 01:43:31.560]  there doing what they can how they can do it and just because it's not the way I
[01:43:31.560 --> 01:43:34.920]  would have handled it but I understand your concern we can't start letting
[01:43:34.920 --> 01:43:38.640]  people use the hecklers veto and the death threats and the menacing to get
[01:43:38.640 --> 01:43:42.360]  their way so I agree you have a very strong point there but at the same time
[01:43:42.360 --> 01:43:46.280]  the calls gotta be made by someone on the ground and by the way folks I'm on
[01:43:46.280 --> 01:43:50.520]  record going to public deals on the street with no bodyguards so anybody
[01:43:50.520 --> 01:43:54.120]  saying oh yeah right Alex I'm on record the video there's hundreds of them out
[01:43:54.120 --> 01:43:59.160]  there I don't care I'm not a coward Alex these communists and cartel and these
[01:43:59.160 --> 01:44:03.960]  backers including many people in suits and ties these backers of the costly and
[01:44:03.960 --> 01:44:07.560]  deadly illegal alien invasion of our American homeland that's killing thousands
[01:44:07.560 --> 01:44:11.880]  of our citizens each year just like our Border Patrol agent Vega just got killed
[01:44:11.880 --> 01:44:16.120]  need to understand many of us either our veterans or a descendants of the
[01:44:16.120 --> 01:44:20.000]  veterans that fought the wars and paid the taxes and spilled the blood that
[01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:24.040]  their own blood to defend our constitution a way of life and we do
[01:44:24.040 --> 01:44:28.560]  not back down the threats in fact we point them out with the ability to
[01:44:28.560 --> 01:44:32.040]  tell our fellow countrymen that we're being targeted because of what we have
[01:44:32.040 --> 01:44:36.440]  to say is a threat to their socialist and communist plans for this country's
[01:44:36.440 --> 01:44:40.360]  destruction well it's just unbelievable because I'm somebody that's
[01:44:40.360 --> 01:44:43.880]  protested to Klan because of their bullying and their sickening activities
[01:44:43.880 --> 01:44:47.280]  and their threats against people and the black folks you know still come out and
[01:44:47.280 --> 01:44:50.640]  and protest against them back when they're blowing up their churches when I
[01:44:50.640 --> 01:44:53.800]  know I was in Waco once and the Klan leader said I'm gonna kill you I'm gonna
[01:44:53.800 --> 01:44:57.440]  blow your head off the police wouldn't do anything you know and I mean that's my
[01:44:57.440 --> 01:45:01.840]  issue but now the Klan's like a few hundred you know guys missing their teeth
[01:45:01.840 --> 01:45:07.240]  and you know and then the Democrats like senator bird grand dragons this is the
[01:45:07.240 --> 01:45:11.960]  media the culture the Pentagon everything behind that the takedown like red
[01:45:11.960 --> 01:45:17.200]  dawn of this country and I know most Hispanics and Hispanic Americans are
[01:45:17.200 --> 01:45:21.360]  against this I know you're talking to them I don't see how the establishment
[01:45:21.360 --> 01:45:25.880]  can get away with this yes I am a Christian and yes I am a bit of a
[01:45:25.880 --> 01:45:30.200]  nationalist but I'm a racially inclusive person that's always made these efforts
[01:45:30.200 --> 01:45:33.920]  and they're not gonna get the enemy it's not gonna give you or I any credit
[01:45:33.920 --> 01:45:37.720]  whatsoever for anything you love all along the truth our abilities to work
[01:45:37.720 --> 01:45:41.040]  with other Americans because they're looking at this like a war and they don't
[01:45:41.040 --> 01:45:45.240]  mind lying for the goals of their war but in that war out there today we're
[01:45:45.240 --> 01:45:49.400]  48 hours away from a very important election in Tennessee where incumbent
[01:45:49.400 --> 01:45:54.840]  senator US senator Lamar Alexander who has voted with Obama 62 percent of the
[01:45:54.840 --> 01:46:00.640]  time is also one of the gang of eight immigration reform amnesty voters is in
[01:46:00.640 --> 01:46:06.480]  a narrow race with Joe Carr who's closed to close the race on him and we're
[01:46:06.480 --> 01:46:09.920]  talking to voters in Tennessee Alex and a lot of after I was on the show last
[01:46:09.920 --> 01:46:15.040]  week a lot of Alex Jones show supporters came forward at our website alley pack
[01:46:15.040 --> 01:46:19.640]  dot US your viewers are helping with phone calls right now in Tennessee
[01:46:19.640 --> 01:46:23.800]  they're helping with donations to find our auto call which was part of the way
[01:46:23.800 --> 01:46:27.960]  that we defeated Eric Cantor and they showed up at several the protest at
[01:46:27.960 --> 01:46:32.920]  Tennessee and Michigan last week so Alex you have a very large audience that is
[01:46:32.920 --> 01:46:37.040]  primed on this issue and ready to take the appropriate action I want all my
[01:46:37.040 --> 01:46:41.040]  supporters to know that while I don't agree with everything you say Alex and
[01:46:41.040 --> 01:46:44.240]  you certainly don't agree with everything that I say you get more
[01:46:44.240 --> 01:46:47.720]  information about what's really happening in this country especially on the
[01:46:47.720 --> 01:46:53.240]  issue of illegal immigration on info wars and Alex Jones show then in an hour
[01:46:53.240 --> 01:46:57.880]  then you get in a month on the mainstream media well I appreciate that
[01:46:57.880 --> 01:47:03.280]  statement but look it's so bold let me ask you this I know you said was on a
[01:47:03.280 --> 01:47:06.800]  knife's edge basically a few weeks ago when you were on which way this would
[01:47:06.800 --> 01:47:12.280]  go but I mean what does the elite plan to do collapsing the collapse third
[01:47:12.280 --> 01:47:16.760]  world into us I mean why does the elite want to wreck the country so bad I know
[01:47:16.760 --> 01:47:20.640]  they want cheap labor and to vote for gun control but this this doesn't help
[01:47:20.640 --> 01:47:24.760]  Latin America it doesn't help anybody it destroys the industrial base even
[01:47:24.760 --> 01:47:31.880]  further I see polls turning against Obama on this front what's the score
[01:47:31.880 --> 01:47:36.520]  right now in this game well we can always speculate about the motivations of the
[01:47:36.520 --> 01:47:39.520]  constellation of different enemies against the United States that are at
[01:47:39.520 --> 01:47:43.960]  work here both from abroad and within the main thing is that we all whether we
[01:47:43.960 --> 01:47:47.800]  have different opinions on that let's unify around the existing Constitution
[01:47:47.800 --> 01:47:51.440]  and the existing border and immigration laws if you support the current
[01:47:51.440 --> 01:47:54.840]  Constitution United States and the existing border and immigration laws
[01:47:54.840 --> 01:47:59.800]  designed to protect American workers and taxpayers and Americans lives from a
[01:47:59.800 --> 01:48:02.720]  legal ambulance or anybody from outside the country that would come here and
[01:48:02.720 --> 01:48:07.120]  cause us harm in any way then you're with us we're together white black Hispanic
[01:48:07.120 --> 01:48:12.120]  Christian Jewish agnostic we are together on those principles and one of
[01:48:12.120 --> 01:48:15.560]  the things I'll mention that I think the elites hate is people that operate on a
[01:48:15.560 --> 01:48:20.080]  basis of principles on a basis of fairness on some type of consideration
[01:48:20.080 --> 01:48:23.480]  other than what you mentioned in the lead into this segment Alex they want to
[01:48:23.480 --> 01:48:30.240]  return to the blue-blooded aristocracy kings and queens rule of the people and
[01:48:30.240 --> 01:48:33.880]  that's why you find so many billionaires like George Soros and Michael
[01:48:33.880 --> 01:48:37.480]  Bloomberg and Rupert Murdoch all singing the same immigration reform
[01:48:37.480 --> 01:48:41.880]  amnesty let's flood the United States with perpetual waves of tens of millions
[01:48:41.880 --> 01:48:45.560]  of illegal emirates until the people that had built this and sustained this
[01:48:45.560 --> 01:48:49.200]  country for 200 years can't even look out their window without bumping hands
[01:48:49.200 --> 01:48:53.460]  with somebody fresh to the country there illegally they're doing this there
[01:48:53.460 --> 01:48:58.520]  all on the same page and we the people the vast majority of the United States
[01:48:58.520 --> 01:49:03.440]  despite what you've heard in some of the designer polls by these billionaires the
[01:49:03.440 --> 01:49:06.560]  vast majority of Americans want our existing laws enforced and they want
[01:49:06.560 --> 01:49:10.440]  the illegals to go home and that's what we want on the national battle a lot of
[01:49:10.440 --> 01:49:14.640]  it's going to depend on what happens in 48 hours 48 hours if Senator Lamar
[01:49:14.640 --> 01:49:19.040]  Alexander loses his seat if Ali Pack is able to afford to be able to complete
[01:49:19.040 --> 01:49:22.920]  this very expensive auto call that we're we're running out of funds on right now
[01:49:22.920 --> 01:49:26.920]  if we can get more people free volunteers on the phone with us over the
[01:49:26.920 --> 01:49:31.480]  next 48 hours if we can take down Lamar Alexander despite some dirty tricks
[01:49:31.480 --> 01:49:35.040]  that your audience might find interesting that he's trying to deploy to
[01:49:35.040 --> 01:49:40.200]  hold on to power roughly if we can take him down it will send a complete ripple
[01:49:40.200 --> 01:49:43.360]  through the ranks of the elites by destroy we've already destroyed their
[01:49:43.360 --> 01:49:47.480]  impression of invulnerability in the house by defeating Eric Cantor if we
[01:49:47.480 --> 01:49:51.040]  destroy that impression of invulnerability of the elites despite
[01:49:51.040 --> 01:49:55.440]  Lamar Alexander's five or six million dollar advantage over us and the Senate
[01:49:55.440 --> 01:50:00.480]  it will allow us to turn the tide on this battle if Lamar wins it will send
[01:50:00.480 --> 01:50:04.360]  the message that you can defy 80% of your Republican constituents you can vote
[01:50:04.360 --> 01:50:08.480]  with Obama to pass amnesty that would harm me American workers harm American
[01:50:08.480 --> 01:50:12.480]  taxpayers allow tens of millions of illegals to form a new voting block to
[01:50:12.480 --> 01:50:16.000]  override American decisions in the future you can do all this and walk right
[01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:20.640]  back into DC so weird we've got 48 hours so tell folks who they tell folks are

[01:50:38.240 --> 01:50:42.560]  close race absolutely Lamar Alexander was involved the North American Union he's
[01:50:42.560 --> 01:50:47.560]  involved in every horrible thing I mean he's literally like Harry Reid he's got
[01:50:47.560 --> 01:50:52.240]  ace up his sleeve he's got a vote spooler a vote splitter named George Dr.

[01:54:30.240 --> 01:54:36.480]  anywhere in Asia or Latin America and get one-tenth the benefits I can't it's a
[01:54:36.480 --> 01:54:41.560]  joke and then we do all this in the Democratic Party goes white people are
[01:54:41.560 --> 01:54:45.680]  bad and Michael Moore says anybody that owns guns is a racist white person
[01:54:45.680 --> 01:54:50.240]  hiding in the woods afraid of black people when blacks are the biggest
[01:54:50.240 --> 01:54:57.280]  victims of gun control if you look it up I mean it just makes me so angry how
[01:54:57.280 --> 01:55:04.640]  nasty the Democratic Party is and how nasty the rhinos are Lamar Alexander
[01:55:04.640 --> 01:55:11.280]  boner baner all of them John McCain there's got to be election fraud to keep
[01:55:11.280 --> 01:55:17.040]  them in but bottom line we need to get rid of Alexander tomorrow you need to
[01:55:17.040 --> 01:55:20.400]  vote for car not for the other vote splitter I've been following that race
[01:55:20.400 --> 01:55:24.920]  there is election fraud but a grassroots movement can overpower those
[01:55:24.920 --> 01:55:28.240]  machines they can only steal it with small percentages according to all the
[01:55:28.240 --> 01:55:33.920]  voting experts PhDs Bev Harris you name it who've been on here William gain of
[01:55:33.920 --> 01:55:42.960]  alley pack dot com other key points you'd like to make before this segment
[01:55:42.960 --> 01:55:47.480]  last week you and your your viewers had a big interest in our national protest
[01:55:47.480 --> 01:55:51.600]  against illegal immigration that's occurring on overpasses intersections
[01:55:51.600 --> 01:55:55.680]  outside Mexican consulates and state houses across the country our next
[01:55:55.680 --> 01:56:00.360]  synchronized national wave is going to be on October 24th and 25th but long
[01:56:00.360 --> 01:56:03.960]  before we get there they're going to be protest occurring all across the country
[01:56:03.960 --> 01:56:08.320]  and we're keeping the master list of those at alley pack dot u.s. that's a
[01:56:08.320 --> 01:56:13.960]  li p a c dot u.s. and the people to get on our email alerts will receive a
[01:56:13.960 --> 01:56:17.640]  direct copy that now we do have Facebook events and pages that we're using but
[01:56:17.640 --> 01:56:21.120]  everyone realized that it's a one-way mirror on Facebook and on the other side
[01:56:21.120 --> 01:56:24.720]  of that the enemies our enemies and enemies of America watching every key
[01:56:24.720 --> 01:56:28.320]  stroke and everything about us and we can't rely on them for the
[01:56:28.320 --> 01:56:32.400]  communication so email alerts are the main ways that we're we're coordinating
[01:56:32.400 --> 01:56:35.480]  those and we'd like to have that's right we always use enemy platforms like
[01:56:35.480 --> 01:56:40.520]  Twitter Facebook Google to reach people what to drive and build our own separate
[01:56:40.520 --> 01:56:44.960]  platforms because they've openly been censoring us and openly using the
[01:56:44.960 --> 01:56:49.840]  systems to combat liberty but the good news is there's so many of us on
[01:56:49.840 --> 01:56:53.720]  Facebook and Twitter that we're beginning to overpower them that's true and
[01:56:53.720 --> 01:56:57.680]  also the power talk radio shows combined internet has entered a new phase
[01:56:57.680 --> 01:57:01.880]  after we saw five to ten thousand Americans like us brought out against
[01:57:01.880 --> 01:57:05.720]  the illegal immigration in Boston two weeks ago you were talking about maybe
[01:57:05.720 --> 01:57:09.640]  doing one near the border something like that and if you did that out or if you
[01:57:09.640 --> 01:57:13.640]  did one on October 24 25th and before then we'd be glad to support it I'd be
[01:57:13.640 --> 01:57:18.520]  glad to fly in to be a part of it especially if you can get a big fan of
[01:57:18.520 --> 01:57:22.120]  Gerald Salente I'm not sure if you can get him on any event for you but a big
[01:57:22.120 --> 01:57:25.400]  fan of Gerald's anything like that you want to do right now Alex the
[01:57:25.400 --> 01:57:29.120]  indications we've got out of Boston is that people are ready to take action and
[01:57:29.120 --> 01:57:33.120]  make stand well I think definitely we need to have some demonstrations and
[01:57:33.120 --> 01:57:36.640]  stuff and people are being threatened not to have them because you know if the
[01:57:36.640 --> 01:57:39.640]  Klan starts threatening to blow up black churches if they march I'm gonna go
[01:57:39.640 --> 01:57:44.200]  march with the black folks like I've done before and if the Hispanic clan is
[01:57:44.200 --> 01:57:47.400]  threatening to kill people looks like I'm gonna I was threatened one time
[01:57:47.400 --> 01:57:50.600]  death-threaded if I went to the Mexican Independence Day parade where they were
[01:57:50.600 --> 01:57:53.640]  gonna promote Raza and I went and got everybody's face and bullhorned them
[01:57:53.640 --> 01:57:57.640]  like we got those clips somewhere it's pretty epic so I looks like I may have
[01:57:57.640 --> 01:58:01.120]  to do that again because I mean this is getting to be too serious of a
[01:58:01.120 --> 01:58:04.680]  situation William gain thank you so much for the time thank you Alex hope
[01:58:04.680 --> 01:58:08.120]  it back same thank you sir all right we're gonna come back with Gerald Salente

[01:58:12.560 --> 01:58:17.240]  wars.com but you should read that info wars.com story that's up on drudge
[01:58:17.240 --> 01:58:22.000]  report.com to illegal charge and murder a border agent killed him in front of his
[01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:27.720]  family and it's just absolutely disgusting what happened to this guy and
[01:58:27.720 --> 01:58:33.240]  it just shows how vicious vicious the situation is in Mexico pouring over in
[01:58:33.240 --> 01:58:39.080]  our border what a sadness we'll be right back stay with us.
[01:58:41.240 --> 01:58:48.720]  This is GCN the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:48.720 --> 01:58:53.520]  What do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday
[01:58:53.520 --> 01:58:57.840]  about a potential forthood situation? The police are shoving people shoving Alex
[01:58:57.840 --> 01:59:03.640]  shoving the crowd. Whether it's the radio show the news websites documentary
[01:59:03.640 --> 01:59:07.720]  films or the nightly news info wars is the tip of the spear. Is this another
[01:59:07.720 --> 01:59:10.800]  false flight stage attack to take our civil liberties and promote homelands
[01:59:10.800 --> 01:59:14.280]  security by sticking the hands down on the fence on the streets? It's up to us to
[01:59:14.280 --> 01:59:17.680]  set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere and that's what
[01:59:17.680 --> 01:59:23.000]  prisonplanet.tv is designed to do. You watch the Assad regime is going to be

[01:59:28.280 --> 01:59:32.520]  What we see now is a war against reality it's a war against the truth. It's more
[01:59:32.520 --> 01:59:36.400]  vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of prison

[02:00:51.640 --> 02:00:57.840]  minute interview with Marine Corps Colonel retired just recently Pete
[02:00:57.840 --> 02:01:02.040]  Martino about the buildup for war against the American people. We've
[02:01:02.040 --> 02:01:05.960]  tweeted that video out it's pretty powerful there was only one other
[02:01:05.960 --> 02:01:10.400]  interview he'd done that was to a city council he was warning of this last year
[02:01:10.400 --> 02:01:15.560]  he got a lot of repercussions good and bad over that well he came to Austin we
[02:01:15.560 --> 02:01:19.200]  met with him and we interviewed him a few weeks ago he wrote an article to go
[02:01:19.200 --> 02:01:23.560]  along with the article to go along with the video so that's up on info wars.com
[02:01:23.560 --> 02:01:32.360]  it's titled I see something I'm gonna make it the featured video as well on the
[02:01:32.360 --> 02:01:36.720]  Alex Jones channel on YouTube sometimes we have stuff that doesn't even go on
[02:01:36.720 --> 02:01:41.320]  the nightly nose of the radio it just goes right to the website first because
[02:01:41.320 --> 02:01:45.920]  it's so important not only issue if I don't build something up and talk about
[02:01:45.920 --> 02:01:49.080]  how important it is people don't seem to think it's important but it is a very
[02:01:49.080 --> 02:01:52.800]  very important interview so please get that out to people especially military
[02:01:52.800 --> 02:01:58.160]  folks where they break down what is currently happening always informative my
[02:01:58.160 --> 02:02:03.640]  good friend Gerald Salente is gonna be joining us he accurately predicted last
[02:02:03.640 --> 02:02:09.280]  year that they would try to start wars wars with Russia and a lot of other
[02:02:09.280 --> 02:02:13.640]  issues and he's gonna talk about the new trends coming up and more Gerald
[02:02:13.640 --> 02:02:21.760]  Salente will be joining us coming up for the balance of the hour and I won't be a
[02:02:21.760 --> 02:02:28.560]  hog I intend to also open the phones up in the last 20 30 minutes with Gerald
[02:02:28.560 --> 02:02:31.720]  Salente so you can ask questions of Gerald with the number we're not giving
[02:02:31.720 --> 02:02:39.240]  the number out yet again looking at some of the other news we haven't really
[02:02:39.240 --> 02:02:45.640]  detailed yet have they announced who the two-star general was yet they got
[02:02:45.640 --> 02:02:51.000]  killed in Afghanistan not yet by one of those soldiers not yet yeah it's not
[02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:55.640]  been announced yet major general two-star general killed in a blue force
[02:02:55.640 --> 02:02:59.760]  green force training base where they're training the Afghan military to grow
[02:02:59.760 --> 02:03:06.400]  LPM and load it on C-130s delivered it to the big banks who then deploy it to
[02:03:06.400 --> 02:03:11.480]  drug dealers and then they the fourth or fifth level down dealer doesn't even
[02:03:11.480 --> 02:03:17.040]  know that that's called a snack that's not just in the movie Scarface written
[02:03:17.040 --> 02:03:25.320]  by Mr. Stone Oliver Stone that's actually the term used in New York and
[02:03:25.320 --> 02:03:30.120]  Miami and other places for police forces that are basically totally corrupt
[02:03:30.120 --> 02:03:33.960]  in the narcotics division when they still got to have some bus they call it
[02:03:33.960 --> 02:03:41.760]  snacks not snacks snacks or snacks and expanding on snacks they'll also go in
[02:03:41.760 --> 02:03:44.560]  your restaurant or business and sell each other drugs that then take your
[02:03:44.560 --> 02:03:49.200]  business so gotta love the old drug war it's really worked out wonderfully
[02:03:49.200 --> 02:03:54.040]  hasn't it imploded Mexico imploding the United States and the globalist used the
[02:03:54.040 --> 02:04:01.600]  crises they've helped create and then import that here for the next level
[02:04:01.600 --> 02:04:06.280]  kind of like they made alcohol illegal for 10 years in the prohibition in the
[02:04:06.280 --> 02:04:10.440]  20s got goody two shoes to go along with it triple the size of the mafia
[02:04:10.440 --> 02:04:19.400]  corrupted the police massive tens of billions in 1920s money made off of that
[02:04:19.400 --> 02:04:23.040]  the corruption of society and then when they couldn't have that illegal they
[02:04:23.040 --> 02:04:28.080]  made narcotics illegal so they could start a new business you could walk into
[02:04:28.080 --> 02:04:34.160]  any apothecary any drugstore anywhere you want it and you could just come right
[02:04:34.160 --> 02:04:41.120]  in and you could say hey that's her laughing I don't know I had scratched

[02:09:22.480 --> 02:09:29.000]  ago but that we added documentation to with retired marine colonel Pete Martino
[02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:38.440]  headline DHS is preparing and prepping for a war with the American people remember
[02:09:38.440 --> 02:09:41.440]  last year he gave a speech at a city council warning people and it became a
[02:09:41.440 --> 02:09:45.040]  big news story because he said he was just in combat a few years ago and got a
[02:09:45.040 --> 02:09:51.680]  bronze star in iraq and he is trained you know major coalition forces all of the
[02:09:51.680 --> 02:09:57.880]  world he's a respected guy and he's saying this that's what's going on it's a
[02:09:57.880 --> 02:10:02.480]  very powerful interview it's coming up in the fourth hour today David Knight is
[02:10:02.480 --> 02:10:08.280]  going to ride shotgun and traffic cop of those segments we're going to be airing
[02:10:08.280 --> 02:10:14.200]  for the rest of the hour we are joined by the man that runs trends research calm
[02:10:14.200 --> 02:10:21.400]  and of course their logo or their catchphrase is very accurate history
[02:10:21.400 --> 02:10:25.600]  before it happens those that don't know history are doomed or repeated it's been
[02:10:25.600 --> 02:10:29.960]  said many times and I know Gerald will have it all with his fingertips not to
[02:10:29.960 --> 02:10:32.920]  to this harm but just to show he knows what he's talking about that they would
[02:10:32.920 --> 02:10:36.280]  try to start war with Russia he said that about four years ago he said it
[02:10:36.280 --> 02:10:40.200]  again last year in one of his major trends he said look for the police state
[02:10:40.200 --> 02:10:43.920]  to expand look for them to try to destabilize the country because they
[02:10:43.920 --> 02:10:48.120]  never get held accountable for creating crises and he talked about further
[02:10:48.120 --> 02:10:54.080]  dollar devaluation and more and we're nearing the next big flashpoint this is
[02:10:54.080 --> 02:10:58.720]  the age of exacerbated and contrived crises so I want to get his take on the
[02:10:58.720 --> 02:11:05.120]  waterfront what the new trends are the trends he predicted accurately and a
[02:11:05.120 --> 02:11:09.280]  bunch of other issues but first Gerald entertained me here for a moment in my
[02:11:09.280 --> 02:11:15.280]  question regardless of what you think about the borders being open or shut
[02:11:15.280 --> 02:11:19.240]  libertarians pure libertarians and I consider myself to be a libertarian but
[02:11:19.240 --> 02:11:22.480]  not a purist because there's no such thing it's a fantasy land in this
[02:11:22.480 --> 02:11:26.520]  current situation you can't have countries that are third world collapse
[02:11:26.520 --> 02:11:30.400]  where people get 50 cents an hour where they don't give us free health care or
[02:11:30.400 --> 02:11:35.960]  free welfare or can't go there and have our babies and then say but all of you
[02:11:35.960 --> 02:11:44.320]  from Brazil to Mexico from Guatemala to China from India to the Congo you can
[02:11:44.320 --> 02:11:48.760]  come here and get everything free and anyone that doesn't like that as a racist
[02:11:48.760 --> 02:11:54.000]  and by the way we're the Democrats go with us we're gonna take the guns and
[02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:57.920]  then give them driver's license in seven states I mean that is an open
[02:11:57.920 --> 02:12:02.240]  political takeover plan and the blue state project we have video via Veritas
[02:12:02.240 --> 02:12:06.400]  project they admit on video we're bringing in folks we're giving them IDs
[02:12:06.400 --> 02:12:10.320]  we're taking over and so I've always been against the Republicans and
[02:12:10.320 --> 02:12:13.440]  Democrats and the Republican blue bloods are horrible they're working with
[02:12:13.440 --> 02:12:18.880]  them on this but for me this border situation is so transparent and then
[02:12:18.880 --> 02:12:22.680]  even if you are for open borders and believe that everyone deserves everything
[02:12:22.680 --> 02:12:28.360]  free seven billion people outside the US everything should be free yes white
[02:12:28.360 --> 02:12:32.240]  people are fundamentally bad and evil they all need to be gotten rid of you
[02:12:32.240 --> 02:12:37.640]  know aka Al Sharpton even if you believe that which of course is ridiculous
[02:12:37.640 --> 02:12:43.800]  Obama is now acting completely outside of Congress unlike any president in our
[02:12:43.800 --> 02:12:49.120]  lifetimes and on every issue on guns on borders whatever saying I'll do
[02:12:49.120 --> 02:12:54.400]  whatever I want I called for Bush's impeachment I called for Clinton's
[02:12:54.400 --> 02:12:58.640]  impeachment because they were bad so did Ron Paul but Ron Paul said two weeks
[02:12:58.640 --> 02:13:03.960]  ago on the show he said Alex you're right Obama is more brazen he's gotten
[02:13:03.960 --> 02:13:08.600]  away with it and he he is arrogant about it and we're in deep trouble we may be
[02:13:08.600 --> 02:13:12.040]  approaching the big event the big collapse point you've been warning
[02:13:12.040 --> 02:13:16.120]  about where we incrementally go into the collapse they deny it they deny this
[02:13:16.120 --> 02:13:21.180]  titanic's listing and that silverware is falling off the side and then
[02:13:21.180 --> 02:13:25.600]  finally the ship's breaking and going under we're in the lifeboats and people
[02:13:25.600 --> 02:13:28.800]  are still denying it Gerald I want to hear from you because you were worked as a
[02:13:28.800 --> 02:13:32.480]  top consultant to government corporations your best-selling author for
[02:13:32.480 --> 02:13:34.720]  folks that don't know who you are most people do but we have a lot of
[02:13:34.720 --> 02:13:40.600]  affiliates you've been inside the system what is the master plan here and how
[02:13:40.600 --> 02:13:45.880]  dangerous is this or do you disagree with me well going back let's start with
[02:13:45.880 --> 02:13:56.240]  the open borders this is old news I wrote about this in trends 2000 in 1996
[02:13:56.240 --> 02:14:02.040]  about one of the greatest threats to America was going to be the immigration
[02:14:02.040 --> 02:14:07.640]  problem it was building then without getting into any emotions and you know
[02:14:07.640 --> 02:14:12.920]  me I'm a political atheist I just stated the facts and how wages kept
[02:14:12.920 --> 02:14:19.240]  declining studies from all across the spectrum showing the proof how American
[02:14:19.240 --> 02:14:24.240]  wages were declining as more and more people were flowing over the borders
[02:14:24.240 --> 02:14:30.280]  and I wrote about the H1B visas before anybody even knew what they were and
[02:14:30.280 --> 02:14:38.720]  that was being pushed by the so-called Silicon Valley people because it brought
[02:14:38.720 --> 02:14:44.800]  in a lot of cheap labor for them what we have Alex is a country of three hundred
[02:14:44.800 --> 02:14:53.280]  and sixteen million people we have a quarter twenty five percent of the young
[02:14:53.280 --> 02:15:04.320]  people poverty we have levels of people on food stamps we still have massive
[02:15:04.320 --> 02:15:11.400]  unemployment and again anybody that wants to see the real unemployment numbers
[02:15:11.400 --> 02:15:19.320]  rather than the baloney that they're shoving down our with throats thanks to
[02:15:19.320 --> 02:15:25.160]  the rejiggering of them by slick will be Clinton you go to John William shadow
[02:15:25.160 --> 02:15:30.320]  stats we're up to around twenty two percent now when you go back to the
[02:15:30.320 --> 02:15:39.160]  Great Depression what did they do they closed the borders one Gerald your sky
[02:15:39.160 --> 02:15:42.840]  is breaking up too much Gerald I want to reconnect with you and have you start
[02:15:42.840 --> 02:15:47.560]  back over because this is so important and I did read your book trends 2000 back
[02:15:47.560 --> 02:15:51.040]  at the time I was in a Barnes and Noble or something and picked it up and I
[02:15:51.040 --> 02:15:56.480]  remember that was in there and again Ross Perot warned everybody and that
[02:15:56.480 --> 02:16:00.440]  wasn't even about open borders that was about lowering the trade deals he said
[02:16:00.440 --> 02:16:05.720]  it would wreck both Mexico and the US and Canada it's done that so it transfers
[02:16:05.720 --> 02:16:09.560]  wealth to the top one tenth of one percent it wrecks the middle class it
[02:16:09.560 --> 02:16:13.720]  doesn't create a ladder up for the poor people and Gerald is breaking it down so
[02:16:13.720 --> 02:16:19.600]  I want to get his trend on where all of this is headed Skype is an amazing
[02:16:19.600 --> 02:16:28.520]  technology obviously right out of Star Trek the only problem is that sometimes
[02:16:28.520 --> 02:16:34.040]  it has hiccups and problems so we're getting Gerald Salente back on right
[02:16:34.040 --> 02:16:38.520]  now we'll carry him to the end of the hour and we'll skip this network break
[02:16:38.520 --> 02:16:43.600]  so that he gets that time back but I wanted to start over with what he
[02:16:43.600 --> 02:16:48.240]  had to say there because that was so critically important this is
[02:16:48.240 --> 02:16:52.720]  mathematical economic fact okay we got him back Gerald please start over from
[02:16:52.720 --> 02:16:57.120]  the beginning your take on what's happening with the borders yes as I
[02:16:57.120 --> 02:17:03.120]  mentioned we wrote about this in trends 2000 here here's a quote migration is a
[02:17:03.120 --> 02:17:08.080]  greater threat to global stability than has been recognized the sheer press of
[02:17:08.080 --> 02:17:12.880]  numbers are very poor made aware by radio and television of living
[02:17:12.880 --> 02:17:19.200]  conditions a boat ride away is likely to become a steadily more destructive
[02:17:19.200 --> 02:17:23.400]  political force
[02:17:24.880 --> 02:17:32.200]  police check our in relations 1994 and here's what I wrote immigration with
[02:17:32.200 --> 02:17:38.960]  its self-sustaining heating system and an endless the poll was a hot issue in
[02:17:38.960 --> 02:17:46.480]  recessionary times even menial jobs are prized and immigration labor drives
[02:17:46.480 --> 02:17:52.360]  wages that still further a University of California study showed that roughly
[02:17:52.360 --> 02:17:57.560]  one-fifth of the growth in the wage gap between the skilled and the unskilled
[02:17:57.560 --> 02:18:06.800]  since the mid-19s was linked to the growing supply of unskilled immigration
[02:18:06.800 --> 02:18:14.680]  labor illegal immigrant was costing the chiefly affected states New York Florida
[02:18:14.680 --> 02:18:21.480]  Texas Illinois in California and estimated $8 billion a year in services
[02:18:21.480 --> 02:18:28.200]  I go on to write money spent on illegal immigrants was money in italics not
[02:18:28.200 --> 02:18:39.720]  spent on needy citizens I wrote this in 1996 unbelievable and now the numbers are
[02:18:39.720 --> 02:18:44.000]  just astronomical and the and the immigrants have been taught their God's
[02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:49.080]  gift to the earth no one can criticize them and they've got full government
[02:18:49.080 --> 02:18:53.040]  backing who wants an endless flood of people that want services as the country
[02:18:53.040 --> 02:18:57.320]  goes bankrupt what is the political class really thinking Gerald the pool well
[02:18:57.320 --> 02:19:02.800]  first of all let's put putting political and class together don't go I mean
[02:19:02.800 --> 02:19:07.160]  whether the political psychopaths and sociopaths and let's go back when we
[02:19:07.160 --> 02:19:13.680]  before when it was breaking up the audio you go back to the great to probably
[02:19:13.680 --> 02:19:17.760]  the Great Depression they put severe limits on immigration so the people in
[02:19:17.760 --> 02:19:22.440]  the country could get jobs and we don't have jobs now as I mentioned when you go
[02:19:22.440 --> 02:19:29.680]  to John Williams shadow stats you see that the number of unemployed 2% so
[02:19:29.680 --> 02:19:34.000]  what kind of embassy would say you know let's open up the borders our people
[02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:38.880]  don't have jobs we're going to bring an even cheaper labor drive down wages and
[02:19:38.880 --> 02:19:46.080]  income even lower so that we can get their votes that's all it's about that's
[02:19:46.080 --> 02:19:51.480]  all the politicians ever care about this is not a humanitarian issue and I'll
[02:19:51.480 --> 02:19:55.880]  stay there this is key this is key Gerald Salante we got to go to break

[02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:20.240]  happening with Russia right now the dollar and more we're not tuning horns

[02:24:23.120 --> 02:24:26.360]  happening you can predict what's coming the establishment knows a lot of this
[02:24:26.360 --> 02:24:29.800]  they just don't want you to know about it but getting back to the border it's
[02:24:29.800 --> 02:24:37.400]  known in the financial actuaries that when a country super booming you want
[02:24:37.400 --> 02:24:42.520]  skilled and some unskilled laborers but when it's in trouble you want to shut
[02:24:42.520 --> 02:24:46.680]  things down well they have just been opening everything up pushing for the
[02:24:46.680 --> 02:24:52.080]  most poor most destitute to be pure clients of the government welfare
[02:24:52.080 --> 02:24:56.640]  state clowered and biven so Gerald we've got you on phone and Skype now clearly
[02:24:56.640 --> 02:25:00.080]  go over the key point they shut our borders down during the Great Depression
[02:25:00.080 --> 02:25:04.960]  we have the numbers we know what's happening it's all about votes it's all
[02:25:04.960 --> 02:25:09.960]  about political power go ahead yes and what's really important as you pointed
[02:25:09.960 --> 02:25:16.000]  out the numbers are there that show how wages decline as immigration increases
[02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:21.200]  and our numbers are terrible we're looking at median household income now
[02:25:21.200 --> 02:25:27.520]  being below 1999 levels and they're even talking about a decline on the median
[02:25:27.520 --> 02:25:35.720]  household of losing 36% of income since 2003 so the more cheap labor keeps
[02:25:35.720 --> 02:25:41.920]  driving down prices this is a political issue as I mentioned if it was a moral
[02:25:41.920 --> 02:25:47.480]  issue and they were going to pound their chests on this hey how about them drone
[02:25:47.480 --> 02:25:53.040]  strikes to blow out people just got a couple yesterday didn't they yeah it
[02:25:53.040 --> 02:25:58.040]  was only in Afghanistan hey how about that moral issue of killing over a
[02:25:58.040 --> 02:26:04.600]  million people in Iraq on a war that was started on lies this has nothing to do
[02:26:04.600 --> 02:26:11.120]  with morality this border issue it has to do with political expedience so when
[02:26:11.120 --> 02:26:15.360]  we look at it and as I mentioned they closed the borders during the Great
[02:26:15.360 --> 02:26:20.800]  Depression they didn't reopen them until well into the 50s and even then
[02:26:20.800 --> 02:26:26.560]  immigration was very moderated and I know first and because I had cousins from
[02:26:26.560 --> 02:26:32.960]  Italy that couldn't come here so this is all for politics has nothing to do with
[02:26:32.960 --> 02:26:38.120]  morality as I see it and then going back to the economics as we're looking at it
[02:26:38.120 --> 02:26:42.920]  as we're talking the markets are continuing to go down oh well one more
[02:26:42.920 --> 02:26:47.960]  point on this immigration issue Alex it's worldwide you're looking at people
[02:26:47.960 --> 02:26:55.520]  flooding out of Libya Tunisia Egypt all the northern Africa Yemen Bahrain the
[02:26:55.520 --> 02:27:02.280]  whole area what's going on now with Israel and Gaza so what I'm saying is
[02:27:02.280 --> 02:27:10.000]  they're flooding over to Europe as well immigration as I wrote in trends 2000 was
[02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:16.680]  going to become a global issue it is there's no stopping it unless I have a
[02:27:16.680 --> 02:27:21.920]  solution by the way we're starting an occupied peace movement and it's built
[02:27:21.920 --> 02:27:28.200]  on rebuild America no foreign entanglements bring home all the troops
[02:27:28.200 --> 02:27:34.440]  and seal the borders as you will know I'm a close combat practitioner I believe
[02:27:34.440 --> 02:27:40.120]  in self-defense I want to defend America I want to defend America by closing the
[02:27:40.120 --> 02:27:44.840]  borders and not become involved in foreign entanglements there's no reason
[02:27:44.840 --> 02:27:50.520]  why these borders are so porous and the hypocrisy of it all we have a homeland
[02:27:50.520 --> 02:27:55.360]  security we have NSA they're spying on us they're watching us in the toilet
[02:27:55.360 --> 02:28:00.880]  they're following us everywhere all on feeling us up at the airport all under
[02:28:00.880 --> 02:28:06.360]  the big lie that they're gonna stop Al Qaeda and Al Nussra while we got what
[02:28:06.360 --> 02:28:11.760]  60,000 little kids flooding over the border on their own who they kidding
[02:28:11.760 --> 02:28:17.560]  with this PS is it the political class in danger and their hubris and their
[02:28:17.560 --> 02:28:21.400]  arrogance of really waking the public up I'm starting to see that happen I mean
[02:28:21.400 --> 02:28:26.080]  to have the TSA still searching babies diapers I've seen it last time I flew
[02:28:26.080 --> 02:28:30.400]  last month and in trying to grab my crotch all the borders wide open and
[02:28:30.400 --> 02:28:35.320]  while our government funds Al Qaeda and IS I mean it just doesn't hold water
[02:28:35.320 --> 02:28:40.400]  anymore exactly but they're not bringing that up in this whole discussion of
[02:28:40.400 --> 02:28:47.240]  immigration flooding over the border illegal immigrants by the millions they're
[02:28:47.240 --> 02:28:53.880]  not bringing up what a scam the whole NSA the whole militarized police state
[02:28:53.880 --> 02:29:00.480]  homeland security is it's just robbing our money and giving it to the cyber
[02:29:00.480 --> 02:29:06.680]  industrial complex and a bunch of crazy SOBs because if it was what they can't
[02:29:06.680 --> 02:29:11.720]  stop kids from coming over the border yeah they're gonna stop Al Qaeda or Al
[02:29:11.720 --> 02:29:17.000]  Nussra you want to get maybe if these kids dress up with a burger on maybe they'll
[02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:23.000]  stop them then it's hypocrisy it's a lie and all they're doing is putting in

[02:37:16.040 --> 02:37:19.920]  give you the floor for the next 10 minutes to break down the trends you
[02:37:19.920 --> 02:37:24.080]  predicted the next phase of the trends other big news we're gonna take some
[02:37:24.080 --> 02:37:27.980]  phone calls with Gerald Salente all right I'm picking up what you said Alex
[02:37:27.980 --> 02:37:32.680]  about how they're dumbing us down with sports and with video games and on and
[02:37:32.680 --> 02:37:38.720]  on celebrity culture the cover of this current trends journal don't blame
[02:37:38.720 --> 02:37:45.240]  Obamacare blame I don't care the people are responsible for what's going on look
[02:37:45.240 --> 02:37:50.960]  what this society has become look how low the bar has been set so that's a major
[02:37:50.960 --> 02:37:55.360]  part of it and also as we were just talking about and again you know you
[02:37:55.360 --> 02:37:59.760]  and I hadn't talked about this before we got on the air about the board is
[02:37:59.760 --> 02:38:06.760]  being open is a story that we did stop terrorism not a chance and we showed
[02:38:06.760 --> 02:38:12.760]  out during the Super Bowl the story that nobody covered on how that guy got on a
[02:38:12.760 --> 02:38:19.760]  bus in New Jersey with credentials he had from an old music concert a few years
[02:38:19.760 --> 02:38:24.800]  earlier got on the bus got through security and gets in front of the
[02:38:24.800 --> 02:38:29.440]  camera as they're interviewing the player of the game and starts talking
[02:38:29.440 --> 02:38:36.920]  about 9-11 and this is when you see that we heard for week after week how the FBI
[02:38:36.920 --> 02:38:42.600]  and the CIA and all the police departments around the metropolitan area
[02:38:42.600 --> 02:38:48.720]  and you saw these guys out there on to the teeth and this guy gets through so
[02:38:48.720 --> 02:38:54.880]  they're lying to us about terrorism to steal our money and if we do have
[02:38:54.880 --> 02:39:01.520]  terrorism could anybody call it payback you can't invade other countries
[02:39:01.520 --> 02:39:08.520]  Florida millions of people destroy their families in their lives and not one to
[02:39:08.520 --> 02:39:15.400]  have them not expect them to get even with you so the whole terrorism thing
[02:39:15.400 --> 02:39:22.480]  is both artificial and being created so that if it does happen we're responsible
[02:39:22.480 --> 02:39:29.280]  for making it happen it didn't happen in a vacuum on to the economy look at the
[02:39:29.280 --> 02:39:34.760]  numbers coming out of China today their service sector is down to nine-year
[02:39:34.760 --> 02:39:42.760]  loads their new indexes are showing eight month lows in other areas and they're
[02:39:42.760 --> 02:39:49.920]  dumping money into the system just like America is over there in Europe they're
[02:39:49.920 --> 02:39:55.720]  coming up with a European name for quantitative easing they're trying to
[02:39:55.720 --> 02:40:02.000]  keep mr. Ponzi alive he's on his deathbed and they're filling it with as much
[02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:09.480]  monetary morphine as they can to keep them a cent to make it as seem as though
[02:40:09.480 --> 02:40:16.040]  he's alive and then you pick up today's Wall Street Journal and you read out all
[02:40:16.040 --> 02:40:22.080]  of the lending institutions are lowering the standards and letting people
[02:40:22.080 --> 02:40:28.800]  borrow money that again are unqualified for it and as we had written in a
[02:40:28.800 --> 02:40:36.560]  trends journal over a year ago how they were building a bubble with auto loans
[02:40:36.560 --> 02:40:42.080]  hey you want to buy a new car don't have a job got no credit we'll make up some
[02:40:42.080 --> 02:40:48.920]  for you so now that bubble is ready to burst as well even with all of this cheap
[02:40:48.920 --> 02:40:55.640]  money you're looking at a housing market that's barely pushing forward and then
[02:40:55.640 --> 02:41:00.760]  you look at some other data coming out you look at the data coming out from
[02:41:00.760 --> 02:41:06.040]  Target from Walmart and you look at data coming out from those places like out
[02:41:06.040 --> 02:41:12.840]  back stakeholders and others that used to service the so-called middle spectrum
[02:41:12.840 --> 02:41:20.520]  of America they did not recover from what they call the winter frigid economy
[02:41:20.520 --> 02:41:28.040]  they expected diet diners to come back out and eat again as they were before
[02:41:28.040 --> 02:41:35.320]  the winter chill set in they're not and you keep adding up the numbers one after
[02:41:35.320 --> 02:41:41.880]  another even at the high end you're looking at coach for example looking at
[02:41:41.880 --> 02:41:50.560]  the clients of 17% the land 21% the last quarter in the U.S. Walmart your Walmart
[02:41:50.560 --> 02:41:57.080]  but even at the high 17% this quarter and here's the language that they use
[02:41:57.080 --> 02:42:01.840]  they just had a merger with like these dollar stores you know two of them I
[02:42:01.840 --> 02:42:06.440]  don't know which I forget the names family dollar and your sister's dollar I
[02:42:06.440 --> 02:42:10.480]  don't know which two they just merged and the way they announced that the
[02:42:10.480 --> 02:42:17.720]  presto to us on CNN CNBC oh the dollar stores were average American shop and
[02:42:17.720 --> 02:42:23.080]  that should have been the end of the cut average American shop at dollar stores
[02:42:23.080 --> 02:42:30.200]  at a time when we grew up when they were when there were in every community there
[02:42:30.200 --> 02:42:37.080]  were department stores of levels of quality and class that are far above
[02:42:37.080 --> 02:42:44.360]  now the May season of so-called middle spectrum they're gone they're washed away
[02:42:44.360 --> 02:42:49.680]  so when we're looking at the economy as dr. Paul Craig Roberts says and by the
[02:42:49.680 --> 02:42:57.320]  way I want to make this really clear there is no one that I respect more for
[02:42:57.320 --> 02:43:05.240]  geopolitics and economic insights and analysis than dr. Paul Craig Roberts so
[02:43:05.240 --> 02:43:11.760]  as he points out I point out and others point out Max Kaiser this is nothing
[02:43:11.760 --> 02:43:18.120]  more than an artificially inflated bubble moving on we're we are on the
[02:43:18.120 --> 02:43:25.920]  today today Alex Jones on your show they are commemorating the first shot fired
[02:43:25.920 --> 02:43:31.960]  of world war one the great war they should never use that word great with
[02:43:31.960 --> 02:43:36.960]  it I know why they use it but they should have used the disastrous war the
[02:43:36.960 --> 02:43:43.920]  war of slaughter the war that killed 20 million plus civilians 90% of the wars
[02:43:43.920 --> 02:43:51.520]  90 90% of the casualties in all of the wars are the civilians so as they can
[02:43:51.520 --> 02:43:57.800]  as they're commemorating that war today we are on the brink of world war three
[02:43:57.800 --> 02:44:03.320]  how many more numbers that people have to add up how many more conflicts are
[02:44:03.320 --> 02:44:09.160]  there and I take that word away that word conflicts is a stupid word to use
[02:44:09.160 --> 02:44:14.120]  and they use it all the time oh a conflict oh you had a disagreement no
[02:44:14.120 --> 02:44:19.600]  what is it going on in Ukraine what is it going on in the Middle East what is
[02:44:19.600 --> 02:44:25.120]  it going on around the world what is it going on in the Xi Jinping province in
[02:44:25.120 --> 02:44:31.120]  China hey hey Thailand's out of the news oh yeah that a military coup yeah but
[02:44:31.120 --> 02:44:36.320]  let's not talk about that you now you're seeing the United States this weekend
[02:44:36.320 --> 02:44:43.000]  announced here's now we are training the Ukrainian National Guard crazy and now
[02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:50.440]  this two-star general gets killed by the Al Qaeda crazy Connie network people I
[02:44:50.440 --> 02:44:54.040]  mean it just shows how the political elites sit back and get more money in
[02:44:54.040 --> 02:44:58.480]  power out of wrecking the planet and wrecking our lives why do we let them
[02:44:58.480 --> 02:45:02.560]  do it I want to go to phone calls Gerald but one more minute and that is what
[02:45:02.560 --> 02:45:06.360]  you've just mentioned and that's what stirred my mind my thought you said
[02:45:06.360 --> 02:45:14.640]  about a general getting killed Alex this is the New York Times today this is
[02:45:14.640 --> 02:45:20.640]  where the dead Americans are they don't make the headlines when a general gets
[02:45:20.640 --> 02:45:27.160]  killed or a quote ambassador in Benghazi then it's news then we have to look
[02:45:27.160 --> 02:45:32.720]  into this but when Keith Williams 19 years old from
[02:45:32.720 --> 02:45:38.840]  vacillia California gets killed he gets way down the bottom of the page along
[02:45:38.840 --> 02:45:47.160]  with the others that are 23 years old 20 another 23 year old from Kenosha
[02:45:47.160 --> 02:45:52.640]  Wisconsin on and on they keep up the little people down at the bottom right
[02:45:52.640 --> 02:45:58.120]  when the big guys get killed we gotta put a commission together we have to look
[02:45:58.120 --> 02:46:02.920]  into it I agree I think I meant to make that point earlier that notice how they
[02:46:02.920 --> 02:46:07.680]  hyped this up but then when the little people die when one man dies you know
[02:46:07.680 --> 02:46:12.160]  it's a tragedy when 10,000 dies a statistic to quote Joseph Stalin but I
[02:46:12.160 --> 02:46:17.560]  noticed in your magazine on page 14 you have a shot of Kerry Grant dress super
[02:46:17.560 --> 02:46:21.400]  sharp like all the photos I saw my great-grandfathers and grandfathers when
[02:46:21.400 --> 02:46:24.880]  they went out because you had respect for yourself you weren't fancy you weren't
[02:46:24.880 --> 02:46:28.760]  a glitterbug you just you know people took you serious you took them serious
[02:46:28.760 --> 02:46:32.240]  and then it just shows how people dress today with their drawers hanging down
[02:46:32.240 --> 02:46:36.800]  around their ankles and again McDonald's I read a study decades ago about this
[02:46:36.800 --> 02:46:42.280]  was the first to put thank you up throw your trash away it didn't even lower the
[02:46:42.280 --> 02:46:47.320]  price of the food it just lowered the service lowered the society's expectations
[02:46:47.320 --> 02:46:52.720]  nobody pumps the gas for you it gets rid of the entry-level jobs car
[02:46:52.720 --> 02:46:57.760]  maintenance goes way down you used to just sit in your car now they do it now
[02:46:57.760 --> 02:47:03.080]  you have to do it and it's the it's the wall Martians and the people having no
[02:47:03.080 --> 02:47:07.560]  concern or not taking it personal that they're being screwed over I think
[02:47:07.560 --> 02:47:14.020]  television did this to us it turned us in to spectator wall Martian zombies and I
[02:47:14.020 --> 02:47:18.320]  think that's why society's gotten so bad Gerald that's part of it and you know
[02:47:18.320 --> 02:47:23.440]  we had a conference here last week it just ended on Sunday history before it
[02:47:23.440 --> 02:47:27.440]  happens conference in colonial Kingston we're at we had they held the meetings
[02:47:27.440 --> 02:47:33.680]  at the 1774 Academy Alex people came from all over the world a young man came
[02:47:33.680 --> 02:47:39.000]  from Japan it was his first time to the states in Australia from Switzerland
[02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:45.440]  from from Oklahoma from Texas all over the world and one of the participants
[02:47:45.440 --> 02:47:53.520]  was a priest and he started talking and he said that he heard me on one on
[02:47:53.520 --> 02:47:58.600]  coast-to-coast one night and talking about what will change and I said the
[02:47:58.600 --> 02:48:02.000]  only thing that will change and it goes back to what you were saying with the
[02:48:02.000 --> 02:48:10.200]  trends journal is when people have courage dignity respect and passion and
[02:48:10.200 --> 02:48:16.440]  that's what's been lost they don't have the dignity and self-respect I'm old
[02:48:16.440 --> 02:48:22.240]  enough to remember when you got on an airplane it wasn't a flying circus you
[02:48:22.240 --> 02:48:27.680]  didn't see a bunch of slobs roll in who could care less about how they looked
[02:48:27.680 --> 02:48:32.640]  how they talked and how they behaved so what it is it's a lowering of the bar
[02:48:32.640 --> 02:48:37.720]  of the culture and they say the fish rocks in the head down I'll tell you
[02:48:37.720 --> 02:48:45.080]  when I really saw the change happen when slick Willie Clinton ran for president
[02:48:45.080 --> 02:48:51.000]  now remember we were used to Eisenhower's and Kennedy's we were used to men of
[02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:58.960]  dignity and courage and all of a sudden a clown rolls out with a pair of sunglasses
[02:48:58.960 --> 02:49:07.600]  on and play in a bad saxophone on our city hall how's that for the for a
[02:49:07.600 --> 02:49:14.280]  presidential presence and it just kept getting lower now you have Obama during
[02:49:14.280 --> 02:49:19.560]  the last campaign and all the rest of them yucking it up on the view and
[02:49:19.560 --> 02:49:26.680]  sitting around with little comics little boys the cold bears and the stewards

[02:49:33.400 --> 02:49:41.320]  comic to get your news you can see how stupid the whole society's become it's
[02:49:41.320 --> 02:49:49.000]  one every night is freak night on TV when the presidents the prime ministers

[02:49:55.000 --> 02:50:01.680]  been lowered so the fish rocks from the head down they sure the pace listen I
[02:50:01.680 --> 02:50:03.880]  want to go to some calls here we're skipping this network break because I

[02:50:23.800 --> 02:50:28.560]  listen to Ray tell you Pharaoh I'm a veteran and my cake at the whole thing
[02:50:28.560 --> 02:50:35.960]  is due to you Alex thank you and bless your soul Americans are too smart they
[02:50:35.960 --> 02:50:42.000]  need a dumbed-down military and a dumbed-down police force in order to do
[02:50:42.000 --> 02:50:46.040]  the one-world order they couldn't have done that with Republicans in they
[02:50:46.040 --> 02:50:51.720]  needed to have the borders open with the Democrats in okay that's the only deal
[02:50:51.720 --> 02:50:56.160]  we got the left hand of the monster and the right hand of the monster now I'd
[02:50:56.160 --> 02:51:01.400]  like to know what is the consequences of our military is now going to take up a
[02:51:01.400 --> 02:51:08.520]  good percentage of these lesser educated immigrants that are coming in well I'm
[02:51:08.520 --> 02:51:11.160]  not even that concerned about people that ended up becoming part of the
[02:51:11.160 --> 02:51:14.360]  military because there's something there when you got women with two or three
[02:51:14.360 --> 02:51:19.080]  kids and they're gonna be hooked on the Democrats immediately to shoot with an
[02:51:19.080 --> 02:51:24.480]  agenda that's racially based I mean it's bad that's not the melting pot that's
[02:51:24.480 --> 02:51:31.640]  Thomas's point listing on KOMY 1340 a.m. and Santa Cruz I should add Gerald
[02:51:31.640 --> 02:51:36.240]  your take on that I think you you covered it you know it's it's it's that the issue
[02:51:36.240 --> 02:51:41.160]  is a dumbing down throughout and they're using this again the immigration
[02:51:41.160 --> 02:51:44.280]  issue is very odd oh yeah I mean Americans have turned into 500 pound
[02:51:44.280 --> 02:51:47.720]  wall Martians you know so let's we're talking about these immigrants all day
[02:51:47.720 --> 02:51:51.800]  we're we're in bad shape as well I mean it's just a mess but I hear what you're
[02:51:51.800 --> 02:51:56.120]  saying Thomas it is about bringing in desperate people that think the Democrats
[02:51:56.120 --> 02:52:01.520]  are their mommy let's talk to Larry in Wyoming you're on the air go ahead yeah
[02:52:01.520 --> 02:52:06.200]  first I'm calling I'll try to get to my point quick I just retired from a
[02:52:06.200 --> 02:52:10.400]  practice of periodontics and I can assure you in the real world with the
[02:52:10.400 --> 02:52:14.600]  people that dress right and look right they're not right yeah I mean in a
[02:52:14.600 --> 02:52:20.320]  biblical sense I'm not a biblical I'm not a religious guy but I'm saying it's
[02:52:20.320 --> 02:52:26.440]  cannibalism as a periodontist I was expected to lie and deceive my patients
[02:52:26.440 --> 02:52:31.040]  so that I could get referrals to cover for the inadequate care of the general
[02:52:31.040 --> 02:52:36.380]  Dennis who were destroying the gum health of the patients waiting to put
[02:52:36.380 --> 02:52:40.320]  crowns on all their teeth and then referring so there's corruption within
[02:52:40.320 --> 02:52:44.440]  every industry I think it's very oh yeah well there are lots people that are
[02:52:44.440 --> 02:52:47.600]  dressed nice that are predators and that there's all sorts of stuff that goes
[02:52:47.600 --> 02:52:50.880]  but of course society's not perfect either but I hear what you're saying do
[02:52:50.880 --> 02:52:55.480]  you have a question was your old slente the question is when do you think the
[02:52:55.480 --> 02:53:02.560]  point of getting real it happens with this culture everybody is basically
[02:53:02.560 --> 02:53:07.520]  cannibalizing everything we've gone into a predatory system rather than a
[02:53:07.520 --> 02:53:12.100]  production system it goes back to morality as I said the fish rots at the
[02:53:12.100 --> 02:53:16.520]  head from the head down so let's suppose I'm still the kid that grew up in the
[02:53:16.520 --> 02:53:20.840]  Bronx and I'm hanging out with the guys and one of my friends has an idea to
[02:53:20.840 --> 02:53:25.720]  pull off a you know a heist over where anything and I say to him hey that's
[02:53:25.720 --> 02:53:31.280]  not right you know what he say to me what are you stupid everybody's ripping
[02:53:31.280 --> 02:53:35.920]  us off the banks are ripping us off the government's ripping us off oh and you
[02:53:35.920 --> 02:53:42.600]  want to play it straight that's why morality is important you have a loss
[02:53:42.600 --> 02:53:49.200]  of morality at every level of government and what people are doing is
[02:53:49.200 --> 02:53:54.480]  they're following the leader there is no morality look at the sword is going
[02:53:54.480 --> 02:53:59.560]  around the world without taking a side on any of the issues where is the where
[02:53:59.560 --> 02:54:03.920]  are the religions talking about this where I don't I don't hear a lot of
[02:54:03.920 --> 02:54:08.840]  what's happening people watch television seven eight hours a day and it and they
[02:54:08.840 --> 02:54:13.520]  just believe the fantasy all the real world's going on around them the public
[02:54:13.520 --> 02:54:19.360]  is asleep I think that's a big part of it let's talk to red in Texas red what's
[02:54:19.360 --> 02:54:26.080]  your question or comment Alex and jail good talk to me I want to go over
[02:54:26.080 --> 02:54:29.960]  something real quick and you may never get off your speakerphone real quick I'm
[02:54:29.960 --> 02:54:32.960]  not on speakerphone I will just ask it real quick because it sounds like
[02:54:32.960 --> 02:54:40.520]  speakerphone I don't know where to go with the money you know I I
[02:54:40.520 --> 02:54:46.520]  always say I'm not the right guy for Bitcoin but to me it kind of reminds me
[02:54:46.520 --> 02:54:51.200]  of the dot-com boom it's hard for me to grasp it and it was hard for me to
[02:54:51.200 --> 02:54:55.800]  grasp a lot of things that were going on the dot-com boom that when it bust I
[02:54:55.800 --> 02:54:59.720]  saw why it bust because there's nothing behind it and there are too many
[02:54:59.720 --> 02:55:03.400]  different countries with too many different regulations and too many
[02:55:03.400 --> 02:55:08.440]  different states that's my position on it having said that there are those that
[02:55:08.440 --> 02:55:12.560]  know a lot more about it and believe in it differently than I do so that's my
[02:55:12.560 --> 02:55:17.120]  take on it I just don't have a grasp on it that makes me comfortable with it I
[02:55:17.120 --> 02:55:22.240]  was about to say I have a bad feeling at the end of the day but it's it's it
[02:55:22.240 --> 02:55:25.600]  but it's now being expressed as a revolution against the big banks so I
[02:55:25.600 --> 02:55:30.040]  get that part I'm just saying watch out folks sure if you want to get involved
[02:55:30.040 --> 02:55:33.040]  that's your issue I think we're gonna start accepting it on the shopping cart
[02:55:33.040 --> 02:55:37.000]  because people are demanding it big mainline groups are using it and so when
[02:55:37.000 --> 02:55:42.400]  in Rome do as the Romans but at the end of the day I'm not recommending people
[02:55:42.400 --> 02:55:46.600]  get involved in it I'm saying that's a choice by choice for each person I would
[02:55:46.600 --> 02:55:51.760]  agree exactly what you said and then I look at the other end of it why would I
[02:55:51.760 --> 02:55:58.120]  want a Bitcoin that's up in vapor when I could buy gold or silver exactly so I'll
[02:55:58.120 --> 02:56:01.760]  use it if people want to use it in commerce I'll use it transferred into
[02:56:01.760 --> 02:56:06.480]  Fed notes then transferred into silver or gold yeah we take subscriptions by the
[02:56:06.480 --> 02:56:09.760]  way with Bitcoin you have no problem doing that and then we just convert it
[02:56:09.760 --> 02:56:14.080]  exactly I mean it's the original alchemy we take Fiat Bitcoin or Fiat
[02:56:14.080 --> 02:56:19.120]  Federal Reserve and then transmute it into property or into crew or into
[02:56:19.120 --> 02:56:23.080]  building new projects or into gold and silver that's right amazing alchemy
[02:56:23.080 --> 02:56:26.880]  let's go ahead and talk to Vincent Montana Vince thanks for holding her on
[02:56:26.880 --> 02:56:32.680]  the air thank you for taking my call guys hey Gerald I've got a question for
[02:56:32.680 --> 02:56:37.440]  I've been posting stuff on the internet for 20 years and I have never run into a
[02:56:37.440 --> 02:56:42.760]  problem being blocked or spammed like I have with this information the CDC owns
[02:56:42.760 --> 02:56:48.000]  the four patents on the Ebola virus I didn't think much of it at first I thought
[02:56:48.000 --> 02:56:51.960]  well maybe they patent everything but every time I attempt to put that out
[02:56:51.960 --> 02:56:57.800]  there I get blocked mark as a spammer I deleted why do you think they don't want
[02:56:57.800 --> 02:57:03.000]  the public to know that the CDC owns the patents for the Ebola virus I think
[02:57:03.000 --> 02:57:07.120]  Alex can answer that better than they well it's look it's a complex issue we
[02:57:07.120 --> 02:57:10.520]  don't know exactly what's happening with the Ebola virus but I know this they've
[02:57:10.520 --> 02:57:13.560]  never brought people into the country that have had it before it's more
[02:57:13.560 --> 02:57:19.320]  recklessness by government what do you say to that caller well I just know that
[02:57:19.320 --> 02:57:24.280]  the fact that they have it patented and the fact that it looks like a nicotine
[02:57:24.280 --> 02:57:31.920]  based stuff the cytokline storming of the Ebola virus it looks to me like it's
[02:57:31.920 --> 02:57:36.400]  a patent issue it looks like someone's trying to make money off the cure well
[02:57:36.400 --> 02:57:39.920]  but then how would they be spreading in Africa I mean I hear you the H1N1 was a
[02:57:39.920 --> 02:57:43.840]  fraud to sell vaccine I hear you we'll look into it we don't know all the
[02:57:43.840 --> 02:57:47.280]  answers yet Gerald sorry the other callers thank you so much for your time

[02:58:00.240 --> 02:58:04.520]  capability keeps building up more and more the sanctions if you remember they
[02:58:04.520 --> 02:58:08.920]  started off very lightly and they keep increasing increasing increasing you have
[02:58:08.920 --> 02:58:13.480]  a time now when Europe is still down economically and it's going to become
[02:58:13.480 --> 02:58:18.440]  more and more difficult to do business and watch for those border incursions
[02:58:18.440 --> 02:58:22.320]  into other countries that's what's going to be a spark for involvement I believe
[02:58:22.320 --> 02:58:25.880]  and they say the Ukraine sanctions is what's plunging our economy and stock
[02:58:25.880 --> 02:58:30.560]  market again hurting everybody Russians and Americans but the EU needs a way to
[02:58:30.560 --> 02:58:33.280]  try to keep from collapsing so war is the way to go

[03:00:26.560 --> 03:00:32.000]  going to be hosting actually what was recorded as a interview here with Alex
[03:00:32.000 --> 03:00:37.640]  Jones and retired Marine Colonel Pete Martino now if you remember about a year
[03:00:37.640 --> 03:00:42.400]  ago they had a situation in Concord New Hampshire where Homeland Security was
[03:00:42.400 --> 03:00:47.120]  giving about a quarter million dollar armored vehicle to the town this very
[03:00:47.120 --> 03:00:51.400]  small town does not have need for a vehicle like that and of course that
[03:00:51.400 --> 03:00:54.760]  was something that this Marine Corps Colonel retired pointed out at the
[03:00:54.760 --> 03:00:59.160]  meeting a lot of at residents of the area were very angry about this why are
[03:00:59.160 --> 03:01:02.720]  we militarizing the police he was very concerned about that we have an article
[03:01:02.720 --> 03:01:07.000]  up today on info wars.com I see something and that's the Marine Corps
[03:01:07.000 --> 03:01:13.240]  Colonel he has a blog it's one man March calm we're going to be playing the
[03:01:13.240 --> 03:01:16.960]  interview that Alex had with him in the studio beginning in the next segment
[03:01:16.960 --> 03:01:20.680]  but I just wanted to point out what happened in the aftermath of this now
[03:01:20.680 --> 03:01:24.040]  they had several angry town council meetings where people were speaking out
[03:01:24.040 --> 03:01:28.160]  about the militarization of the police they delayed it several times then
[03:01:28.160 --> 03:01:32.480]  eventually what they did was they decided 11 to 4 in the town council to
[03:01:32.480 --> 03:01:37.640]  take this bearcat saying you know basically this is free well so was the
[03:01:37.640 --> 03:01:42.520]  Trojan horse and just like the Trojan horse brought in danger into the city I
[03:01:42.520 --> 03:01:47.040]  believe that these militarized police vehicles at Department of Homeland Security
[03:01:47.040 --> 03:01:51.240]  is handing out like candy to all these different police departments is really
[03:01:51.240 --> 03:01:56.320]  kind of a Trojan horse in a psychological war psychological war
[03:01:56.320 --> 03:02:01.240]  that is primarily aimed not even so much at the citizens at this point but at the
[03:02:01.240 --> 03:02:07.040]  police training them to think of themselves as being in a war zone that
[03:02:07.040 --> 03:02:11.720]  the civilians are somebody that they need to control somebody that is a direct
[03:02:11.720 --> 03:02:15.040]  threat to them we see this happening all the time just yesterday they were
[03:02:15.040 --> 03:02:19.080]  talking about how sovereign citizens are now the number one threat according to
[03:02:19.080 --> 03:02:22.960]  the FBI far more than Muslim terrorists and we've seen this over and over again
[03:02:22.960 --> 03:02:27.920]  you know I saw something along with Joe Biggs when we went to the facility the
[03:02:27.920 --> 03:02:32.320]  asymmetric warfare facility at AP Hill in Virginia we saw what they're training
[03:02:32.320 --> 03:02:36.280]  for this Marine Colonel who was in Fallujah saw what they were training for
[03:02:36.280 --> 03:02:40.480]  when they spoke out about it they had eight people who were up for re-election
[03:02:40.480 --> 03:02:45.600]  last November for that city council not incumbents usually get elected even
[03:02:45.600 --> 03:02:50.400]  unopposed but when they're opposed they've had in the 2011 elections they
[03:02:50.400 --> 03:02:55.120]  only had four contested races and incumbents won every single one of
[03:02:55.120 --> 03:03:00.160]  those now after they gave this bearcat to the police department and after that
[03:03:00.160 --> 03:03:05.360]  became an issue people stood up they opposed these councilmen and in three out
[03:03:05.360 --> 03:03:09.840]  of five of the contested races the people who had voted for this bearcat
[03:03:09.840 --> 03:03:15.160]  were thrown out we need to look at what is happening in our country that's the
[03:03:15.160 --> 03:03:18.440]  point of his article now when you look at this article we have up on info wars
[03:03:18.440 --> 03:03:22.920]  calm I see something there's actually an article there where he's talking about
[03:03:22.920 --> 03:03:27.240]  his perspective saying we need to look at the corruption we need to open our
[03:03:27.240 --> 03:03:32.080]  eyes and then we need to do something about it it's got to come from us at the
[03:03:32.080 --> 03:03:36.160]  grassroots level now he talks about a lot of different things in this interview
[03:03:36.160 --> 03:03:40.040]  we're going to run it for the entire hour when it comes up so you don't want
[03:03:40.040 --> 03:03:44.240]  to miss that but it's something that we see over and over again and I tell you
[03:03:44.240 --> 03:03:48.560]  when Joe Biggs and I were walking through that asymmetric warfare center
[03:03:48.560 --> 03:03:53.120]  seeing how our army is training for it was it was very eerie walking through
[03:03:53.120 --> 03:03:58.560]  that empty town an exact replica of an American small town even with the
[03:03:58.560 --> 03:04:02.760]  working traffic lights and that was what was kind of eerie it was like you
[03:04:02.760 --> 03:04:05.520]  expect to see somebody and you're looking and you don't see anyone it's a
[03:04:05.520 --> 03:04:10.960]  ghost town it was like a town after a pandemic like something out of a movie
[03:04:10.960 --> 03:04:16.720]  like Omega man or you're the last man on earth that was strange enough that was
[03:04:16.720 --> 03:04:21.720]  unsettling enough but to know what this facility has been constructed for
[03:04:21.720 --> 03:04:25.760]  because we've covered this in so many different ways it's not just the
[03:04:25.760 --> 03:04:29.520]  militarized vehicles that they're giving to the police departments it's not just
[03:04:29.520 --> 03:04:34.880]  the billions of rounds of ammunition it is so many things as well as their war
[03:04:34.880 --> 03:04:38.240]  gaming scenarios they're up front about it and they're training for it in
[03:04:38.240 --> 03:04:41.960]  facilities like that and the Marines train for it at Camp Lejeune they have
[03:04:41.960 --> 03:04:45.440]  a more rural setting so stay with us right after the break we're gonna have a
[03:04:45.440 --> 03:04:51.880]  Marine Corps Colonel who points out that this is training for warfare against

[03:08:06.920 --> 03:08:14.400]  information war continues it's alex jones and the GCN radio network
[03:08:16.200 --> 03:08:19.640]  welcome back to the alex jones show I'm David Knight now it was about a year
[03:08:19.640 --> 03:08:25.720]  ago on August 15th 2013 that a former Marine Corps Colonel in New Hampshire
[03:08:25.720 --> 03:08:30.200]  retired spoke out about the militarization of the police in a small
[03:08:30.200 --> 03:08:35.120]  New Hampshire town saying we don't need these massive vehicles he said we are
[03:08:35.120 --> 03:08:39.440]  building an army a domestic army over here and I can't believe that people
[03:08:39.440 --> 03:08:44.360]  aren't seeing it is everybody blind we wanted to have him in here to explain
[03:08:44.360 --> 03:08:47.280]  further and so alex had him in for an interview we've got that up on info
[03:08:47.280 --> 03:08:52.000]  wars.com and an article I see something Marine Colonel warns of takeover we have
[03:08:52.000 --> 03:08:55.400]  this video interview up there in case you want to pass us around others we
[03:08:55.400 --> 03:09:01.360]  wanted to play it for you on the radio here's that interview with alex jones it
[03:09:01.360 --> 03:09:07.720]  was back in 2013 in August or a little less than a year ago that there was a
[03:09:07.720 --> 03:09:13.160]  video posted of a Marine Corps Colonel who's also an advisor to the army and
[03:09:13.160 --> 03:09:18.840]  veteran of the Iraq wars you name it speaking out at a city council warning
[03:09:18.840 --> 03:09:23.920]  them that military equipment and training was being pre-positioned around
[03:09:23.920 --> 03:09:28.920]  the country by homeland security and it was pointed at the American people well
[03:09:28.920 --> 03:09:33.600]  in the last year since he talked about that we have seen thousands of headlines
[03:09:33.600 --> 03:09:38.000]  literally dozens a week like this one from the London Guardian Pentagon
[03:09:38.000 --> 03:09:43.240]  preparing for mass civil unrest social breakdown here's another one the cost of
[03:09:43.240 --> 03:09:50.640]  the American police state battlefield USA trillions in the last 20 years spent
[03:09:50.640 --> 03:09:56.760]  building up this giant domestic apparatus hundreds of billions just the
[03:09:56.760 --> 03:10:03.120]  last five years it is simply incredible that's from the ACLU study so we're
[03:10:03.120 --> 03:10:08.680]  really honored today to have Pete Martino in the studio with us for this
[03:10:08.680 --> 03:10:12.200]  special report we appreciate his courage because obviously the establishment
[03:10:12.200 --> 03:10:16.080]  has criticized him for talking about the 10 trillion pound elephant the living
[03:10:16.080 --> 03:10:21.080]  room or the fact that the emperors not wearing any clothes he is a retired
[03:10:21.080 --> 03:10:26.880]  colonel in the US Marine Corps reserves now he's commanded an infantry platoon
[03:10:26.880 --> 03:10:31.120]  company in battalion and has been the senior US advisor to an Iraqi army
[03:10:31.120 --> 03:10:35.480]  brigade and he got a bronze star for some of the operations he was involved in
[03:10:35.480 --> 03:10:40.680]  in new mania Iraq so after more than 10 months of trying to get him in studio
[03:10:40.680 --> 03:10:44.560]  we've got Colonel Martino right here with us Colonel great to have you here
[03:10:44.560 --> 03:10:49.040]  with us thanks Alex just call me Pete I'm a civilian now well one of the things
[03:10:49.040 --> 03:10:53.600]  I'd like to say first off is I had a very highly educated Iraqi tell me one
[03:10:53.600 --> 03:10:58.240]  time that the way to solve the IED problem over there was first time you
[03:10:58.240 --> 03:11:03.160]  have an attack take a look around find the closest house go knock on the door
[03:11:03.160 --> 03:11:07.280]  tell those folks you got one hour to pack and get out and then blow up their
[03:11:07.280 --> 03:11:11.720]  house and the logic there is next time pay attention what goes on in front of
[03:11:11.720 --> 03:11:14.960]  your house and I think that's the mindset in a lot of the world and one of
[03:11:14.960 --> 03:11:19.760]  the messages I think they should come out of that to the American people is the
[03:11:19.760 --> 03:11:24.680]  reason so many people in the world want to kill us is because we need to pay
[03:11:24.680 --> 03:11:28.640]  attention on what's going on in our own house and when it comes to these bear
[03:11:28.640 --> 03:11:33.440]  cats in this issue to be honest with you I really don't have a problem with the
[03:11:33.440 --> 03:11:37.280]  police having bear cats if it's to keep me safe and to keep police officers
[03:11:37.280 --> 03:11:41.640]  safe in fact I know about a dozen police officers personally in New Hampshire
[03:11:41.640 --> 03:11:45.720]  who if they were the ones holding the key they could park it in my driveway and
[03:11:45.720 --> 03:11:50.000]  I'd sleep better at night but the reality is I don't know all the people who
[03:11:50.000 --> 03:11:53.840]  have the keys to those bear cats and the thing that concerned me in conquered
[03:11:53.840 --> 03:11:59.240]  last year was that the chief of police justified on his grant application for
[03:11:59.240 --> 03:12:03.720]  that bear cat as one of the reasons was to deal with the daily challenges of the
[03:12:03.720 --> 03:12:09.440]  free state project now the free state project is just a group of Liberty minded
[03:12:09.440 --> 03:12:14.960]  individuals activists we're trying to get 20,000 people activists to move to
[03:12:14.960 --> 03:12:19.360]  New Hampshire because it's a small state and try to restore Liberty there and
[03:12:19.360 --> 03:12:24.840]  return to constitutional government about a dozen of them are already state
[03:12:24.840 --> 03:12:29.720]  representatives there and they're saying we need armored vehicles that have been
[03:12:29.720 --> 03:12:34.240]  used in Iraq because the free state project peacefully and politically
[03:12:34.240 --> 03:12:37.920]  there symbols the porcupine doesn't attack anybody but it'll defend itself
[03:12:37.920 --> 03:12:43.400]  want to try to vote for more freedom so we need armored vehicles exactly and I
[03:12:43.400 --> 03:12:47.560]  think some of them are a little bit out there as far as some of their tactics I
[03:12:47.560 --> 03:12:51.560]  know some of them are out there maybe taking off a lot of the police and I
[03:12:51.560 --> 03:12:54.760]  think they should knock it off because it's not the police that are really the
[03:12:54.760 --> 03:12:58.880]  problem it's it's some of the leadership and it's the laws themselves one of the
[03:12:58.880 --> 03:13:04.080]  free state project members actually reminded everybody that New Hampshire
[03:13:04.080 --> 03:13:08.240]  has an open carry law and he reminded everybody by walking down the street in
[03:13:08.240 --> 03:13:12.840]  Manchester, New Hampshire downtown and was stopped by the police and detained
[03:13:12.840 --> 03:13:17.800]  for a while until finally people realized that it's not an illegal act to walk
[03:13:17.800 --> 03:13:21.600]  down the street open carrying and since then now you can see people open
[03:13:21.600 --> 03:13:26.080]  carrying so if we don't remind people of our freedoms people forget we have them
[03:13:26.080 --> 03:13:30.400]  and I agree that's the cutting edge of the true civil rights movement is open
[03:13:30.400 --> 03:13:34.000]  carrying and things like that because a right not exercised is dead but Colonel I
[03:13:34.000 --> 03:13:38.200]  want to go back to that city council meeting and play a few clips right now
[03:13:38.200 --> 03:13:43.280]  what's happening here is we're building a domestic military because it's
[03:13:43.280 --> 03:13:48.560]  unlawful or unconstitutional to use American troops on American soil so what
[03:13:48.560 --> 03:13:53.280]  we're doing is we're building a military my best friend who's a SWAT officer in
[03:13:53.280 --> 03:13:58.440]  Nashua who came to Iraq with me trained Iraqi police sent me an email with a
[03:13:58.440 --> 03:14:03.320]  picture of him the media on the streets of Watertown mass wearing the exact same
[03:14:03.320 --> 03:14:08.200]  combat gear that we had in Iraq only it was a different color and what the way
[03:14:08.200 --> 03:14:12.360]  we do things in the military is called task organization you take a command and
[03:14:12.360 --> 03:14:17.040]  then you attach units to it in order to accomplish the mission what's happening
[03:14:17.040 --> 03:14:22.960]  is Homeland Security is pre-staging gear equipment consistent it's what we're
[03:14:22.960 --> 03:14:27.120]  doing here and let's not kid about it we're building a domestic army and we're
[03:14:27.120 --> 03:14:30.000]  shrinking the military because the government is afraid of its own
[03:14:30.000 --> 03:14:34.080]  citizens we're building an army over here and I can't believe that people aren't
[03:14:34.080 --> 03:14:52.000]  seeing it is everybody blind that's all I understand though your point about not
[03:14:52.000 --> 03:14:55.720]  blaming the police individually or the military individually I found police and
[03:14:55.720 --> 03:14:59.440]  military some of the most awake pro-liberty people out there because
[03:14:59.440 --> 03:15:03.960]  they know what's going on the inside but undoubtedly now they say that Homeland
[03:15:03.960 --> 03:15:08.640]  Security is not for Al Qaeda that you fought in Iraq it's for the Tea Party
[03:15:08.640 --> 03:15:13.400]  for veterans for gun owners that's in the news and that it's for domestic groups
[03:15:13.400 --> 03:15:18.240]  and civil unrest that's on the Constitutional under Posse Commentatus
[03:15:18.240 --> 03:15:22.560]  well I think one of the reasons that I have concerns about Homeland Security as
[03:15:22.560 --> 03:15:26.640]  I said it comes down to trust and one of the things that doesn't instill trust in
[03:15:26.640 --> 03:15:31.320]  me is that chief the chief of staff of Homeland Security was actually turned
[03:15:31.320 --> 03:15:36.680]  state witness and testified against his father-in-law who was a state senator in
[03:15:36.680 --> 03:15:41.800]  Pennsylvania and he was charged and went to prison for 137 counts of
[03:15:41.800 --> 03:15:48.600]  corruption and the I think it what's his name Christian Marrone who's the now the
[03:15:48.600 --> 03:15:53.800]  chief of staff of Homeland Security worked for the senator spent 80% of his
[03:15:53.800 --> 03:15:57.480]  time doing personal work for the senator particularly overseeing
[03:15:57.480 --> 03:16:01.960]  construction projects on the senator's house and Philadelphia City Councilman
[03:16:01.960 --> 03:16:06.720]  said that he basically turned over on his father-in-law to keep himself from
[03:16:06.720 --> 03:16:10.560]  going to jail so these are imperfect people that are in the system that's
[03:16:10.560 --> 03:16:14.120]  why you've got to put restraints on it checks and balances and we're all in
[03:16:14.120 --> 03:16:17.840]  perfect and that's the scary part how much power do we want to give people who
[03:16:17.840 --> 03:16:22.240]  were imperfect especially someone like this who used as justification while it
[03:16:22.240 --> 03:16:27.400]  was you know the culture of Philadelphia politics so exactly I mean we didn't
[03:16:27.400 --> 03:16:31.000]  have military on the streets before in America because we understood that
[03:16:31.000 --> 03:16:35.240]  always turned bad why is it happening now we're not talking about during riots
[03:16:35.240 --> 03:16:39.200]  just roll them out have them out there talk about why you originally went to
[03:16:39.200 --> 03:16:43.640]  the city council and warned people and then I want to get your take on the NSA
[03:16:43.640 --> 03:16:47.240]  on the IRS because you've got an incredible list of things to talk about
[03:16:47.240 --> 03:16:51.760]  Colonel well thanks the thing that actually brought me to that city council
[03:16:51.760 --> 03:16:57.560]  meeting was one of my sons one of his friends was a victim of police abuse and
[03:16:57.560 --> 03:17:02.400]  in some of these police departments all over the country but even in New Hampshire
[03:17:02.400 --> 03:17:06.240]  and some of these small towns you get some bad apples and the problem is that
[03:17:06.240 --> 03:17:11.440]  those bad apples like in any industry any organization any bureaucracy whether
[03:17:11.440 --> 03:17:17.800]  it's the IRS the NSA and so on you've got these people who abuse their power and
[03:17:17.800 --> 03:17:22.440]  so when people are victimized by people in power it's a lot different than
[03:17:22.440 --> 03:17:26.360]  when somebody robbing you and to take your wallet these people have power in
[03:17:26.360 --> 03:17:30.360]  the authority of government behind them and so I think institutions need to take
[03:17:30.360 --> 03:17:36.400]  a little bit of pride in and step up themselves and police their own and I'm
[03:17:36.400 --> 03:17:40.600]  shocked that nobody at the IRS has come forward somebody sat next to lowest
[03:17:40.600 --> 03:17:44.360]  learner somebody in some of these agencies was in the next cubicle and
[03:17:44.360 --> 03:17:47.640]  knew what was going on and still knows what's going on and yet you don't see
[03:17:47.640 --> 03:17:51.080]  people coming forward and talking about it so when you work for a government
[03:17:51.080 --> 03:17:55.840]  agency and people start broad brushing that agency and talking about it they're
[03:17:55.840 --> 03:18:00.280]  talking about you same thing with our country when people say negative things
[03:18:00.280 --> 03:18:03.640]  about the United States or they want to kill us or whatever they're talking about
[03:18:03.640 --> 03:18:08.560]  you and me the United States isn't some piece of dirt it's not some monument
[03:18:08.560 --> 03:18:12.480]  some building it's you and me it's us it's we the people that's why I do what I
[03:18:12.480 --> 03:18:15.840]  do is I don't want it my name exactly and so where are the people in these
[03:18:15.840 --> 03:18:19.680]  agencies you know that where's the embarrassment where's the shame where's
[03:18:19.680 --> 03:18:24.280]  the the sense of conscience to go out there and speak up and say something and
[03:18:24.280 --> 03:18:27.760]  a lot of people are afraid of retaliation or losing their job we'll go get
[03:18:27.760 --> 03:18:31.680]  another job look for one beforehand look for other well I found historically but
[03:18:31.680 --> 03:18:35.200]  also personally we're gonna lose everything if we don't standing you
[03:18:35.200 --> 03:18:38.680]  start standing up for what's right this attitude is just go along don't make
[03:18:38.680 --> 03:18:44.760]  waves is gonna cause a literal tsunami of tyranny to bring it all down and all
[03:18:44.760 --> 03:18:47.800]  boys down to integrity and that's one of the things that scares me too is the
[03:18:47.800 --> 03:18:52.600]  director of Homeland Security said that he was impressed with his new chief of
[03:18:52.600 --> 03:18:56.720]  staff's integrity so when we talk about integrity I don't know what their
[03:18:56.720 --> 03:19:00.880]  definition is but you know I thought it was interesting you know we talk about
[03:19:00.880 --> 03:19:04.160]  the integrity of the Department of Homeland Security you know here we are
[03:19:04.160 --> 03:19:07.600]  being told that the NSA needs to turn the whole planet into the Truman show
[03:19:07.600 --> 03:19:11.640]  and we're all Truman and yet at the same time we've got people walking across
[03:19:11.640 --> 03:19:16.280]  the border you know without any ID just being shipped all over the country
[03:19:16.280 --> 03:19:21.400]  borders wide open yeah but Homeland Security is for veterans tea party gun
[03:19:21.400 --> 03:19:25.360]  owners libertarians just like you said a year ago why are why are the armored
[03:19:25.360 --> 03:19:30.360]  vehicles for the peaceful free state project exactly it's a fraud it's
[03:19:30.360 --> 03:19:34.880]  domestically being pointed at us so we need to have a national debate about it
[03:19:34.880 --> 03:19:38.840]  and explain hey you better point that somewhere else and what it comes down to
[03:19:38.840 --> 03:19:42.200]  is the integrity of an organization by looking at its mission statement and
[03:19:42.200 --> 03:19:46.280]  this is the part that I think is wrong with this country is we've got all these
[03:19:46.280 --> 03:19:50.560]  lofty mission statements and all of our institutions and yet if you look at the
[03:19:50.560 --> 03:19:56.880]  at the mission statement and try to follow that mission statement you end up
[03:19:56.880 --> 03:20:00.600]  in trouble with your supervisors you know right from the Department of Homeland
[03:20:00.600 --> 03:20:04.720]  Security's website there are five core missions prevent terrorism and enhancing
[03:20:04.720 --> 03:20:09.680]  security secure and manage our borders enforce and administer our immigration
[03:20:09.680 --> 03:20:14.320]  laws safeguard and secure cyberspace ensure resilience to disasters now
[03:20:14.320 --> 03:20:18.440]  they're acting contrary to at least three of those core mission statements and
[03:20:18.440 --> 03:20:22.760]  so you know I'd like to challenge all those you know border folks down there I
[03:20:22.760 --> 03:20:25.800]  know there's some good people down there who are trying to speak up but you know
[03:20:25.800 --> 03:20:29.760]  people need to band together and stand up and start doing what's right point to
[03:20:29.760 --> 03:20:33.320]  your mission statement if you're being told to do something that's contrary to
[03:20:33.320 --> 03:20:36.560]  that you need to go up the chain of command until you find somebody who's
[03:20:36.560 --> 03:20:40.720]  willing to do something about it I saw an article just a few days ago in Reuters
[03:20:40.720 --> 03:20:46.440]  about them giving an award nationally to all the people in Operation Valkyrie
[03:20:46.440 --> 03:20:49.960]  that tried to kill Hitler and they teach in the German military now if somebody
[03:20:49.960 --> 03:20:54.200]  tells you do something illegal or to violate people's rights it's not a right
[03:20:54.200 --> 03:20:59.160]  it's a duty to resist it well that was taught in the past in our military
[03:20:59.160 --> 03:21:02.640]  manuals I've seen the ones up until the 70s I don't see that being taught now
[03:21:02.640 --> 03:21:07.560]  exactly I was in the Budapest Airport one time and I saw a display for cigarettes
[03:21:07.560 --> 03:21:11.680]  for sale and they had multiple warning signs you know labels in multiple
[03:21:11.680 --> 03:21:15.680]  languages and one of them the one in English said this product will kill you
[03:21:15.680 --> 03:21:21.160]  I love that straight to the point honest wouldn't it be nice if our politicians
[03:21:21.160 --> 03:21:24.480]  and our government agencies came with those same warning labels instead of
[03:21:24.480 --> 03:21:28.040]  the lofty ones that we come up with that are hypocritical but you get called an
[03:21:28.040 --> 03:21:31.320]  extremist for saying out of control government will kill you George
[03:21:31.320 --> 03:21:37.080]  Washington basically said that and they call that terrorism now
[03:21:37.080 --> 03:21:51.080]  but the bottom line is for them they are not now why is that important to understand because they are committed to their cause and to their way of life as you are yours and they see you as being wrong
[03:21:51.080 --> 03:21:56.080]  who was the first terrorist organization in the United States
[03:21:56.080 --> 03:21:57.080]  who?
[03:21:57.080 --> 03:21:58.080]  Founding father
[03:21:58.080 --> 03:21:59.080]  Founding father
[03:21:59.080 --> 03:22:00.080]  Founding father
[03:22:00.080 --> 03:22:01.080]  You mean Thomas Jefferson?
[03:22:01.080 --> 03:22:02.080]  Oh yeah
[03:22:02.080 --> 03:22:04.080]  You mean George Washington?
[03:22:04.080 --> 03:22:05.080]  Oh yeah
[03:22:05.080 --> 03:22:06.080]  Paul Wenger?
[03:22:06.080 --> 03:22:07.080]  Yeah
[03:22:07.080 --> 03:22:09.080]  These guys right here
[03:22:09.080 --> 03:22:10.080]  who do you ask yourself?
[03:22:10.080 --> 03:22:12.080]  Did they try to scare people?
[03:22:12.080 --> 03:22:13.080]  Oh yeah
[03:22:13.080 --> 03:22:15.080]  They tried to intimidate the British
[03:22:15.080 --> 03:22:18.080]  Did they try to, did they use active violence?
[03:22:18.080 --> 03:22:28.080]  Your founding fathers, my founding fathers were involved in acts of terrorism against British officials because they systematically had British officials assassinate
[03:22:28.080 --> 03:22:37.080]  I mean that is scary when the government is saying criticizing us and promoting what the country is founded on is extremist to connect to terrorism
[03:22:37.080 --> 03:22:43.080]  Well here's another great mission statement and this is right out of the VA's website
[03:22:43.080 --> 03:22:48.080]  VA's five core values underscore the obligations inherent in VA's mission
[03:22:48.080 --> 03:22:53.080]  Integrity, commitment, advocacy, respect and excellence
[03:22:53.080 --> 03:22:58.080]  The core values define who we are, our culture and how we care for veterans
[03:22:58.080 --> 03:23:07.080]  Taking the first letter of each word, integrity, commitment, advocacy, respect and excellence creates a powerful acronym I care
[03:23:07.080 --> 03:23:08.080]  Come on
[03:23:08.080 --> 03:23:09.080]  Why aren't people in prison right now?
[03:23:09.080 --> 03:23:15.080]  If anybody gave a damn that we've got over a thousand veterans died because of being ignored
[03:23:15.080 --> 03:23:16.080]  Secret death list
[03:23:16.080 --> 03:23:24.080]  Yeah and so meanwhile though the president seems to know more about the healthcare of a prisoner of war on the other side of the country
[03:23:24.080 --> 03:23:28.080]  or on the other side of the world who's been accused of being a deserter
[03:23:28.080 --> 03:23:35.080]  and he couldn't notify Congress and give them the 30-day notice that by law, the law that he signed he was obligated to do
[03:23:35.080 --> 03:23:42.080]  release five known terrorists from Guantanamo Bay which arguably could be treason
[03:23:42.080 --> 03:23:47.080]  because it's aiding and abetting the enemy to get this one soldier back and he couldn't tell anybody about it in Congress
[03:23:47.080 --> 03:23:51.080]  because the hell his health was in such dire need there was
[03:23:51.080 --> 03:23:52.080]  Now he's back on regular duty
[03:23:52.080 --> 03:23:56.080]  He probably had better healthcare while he was a prisoner of war, he's still alive
[03:23:56.080 --> 03:23:59.080]  Five years later we've got veterans who can't say the same thing
[03:23:59.080 --> 03:24:02.080]  Well Joe Biggs right here in this office coughs up blood every night
[03:24:02.080 --> 03:24:07.080]  He was blown up multiple times in armored vehicles and he literally they keep sending him to other meetings
[03:24:07.080 --> 03:24:11.080]  They keep and then the illegals come across God bless them
[03:24:11.080 --> 03:24:14.080]  They get free healthcare but our veterans have had it turned off
[03:24:14.080 --> 03:24:16.080]  Why do you think the system's doing that?
[03:24:16.080 --> 03:24:22.080]  Well I think that it comes down to we've got corruption at the highest levels of all of our institutions
[03:24:22.080 --> 03:24:25.080]  and that's I think the main point to get across
[03:24:25.080 --> 03:24:28.080]  If you look at most of our institutions in this country
[03:24:28.080 --> 03:24:33.080]  You've got people at the front lines who are honest, have integrity
[03:24:33.080 --> 03:24:37.080]  They're doing their job, they're trying to live the mission statement
[03:24:37.080 --> 03:24:41.080]  The VA has some of the most salt of the earth people working there
[03:24:41.080 --> 03:24:43.080]  The ones who are actually providing the care
[03:24:43.080 --> 03:24:49.080]  But when you look at these corrupt bureaucrats who are making money on the blood of veterans
[03:24:49.080 --> 03:24:55.080]  By earning bonuses, by trying to falsify records to show what great care they're giving everybody
[03:24:55.080 --> 03:25:00.080]  Somebody needs to send these people to prison and it's just like blowing up the person's house
[03:25:00.080 --> 03:25:04.080]  Next time pay attention, it sends a message to everybody else in the neighborhood
[03:25:04.080 --> 03:25:09.080]  Pay attention, if you punish somebody like a lowest learner or some of these folks
[03:25:09.080 --> 03:25:13.080]  These bureaucrats and these other agencies that we know are corrupt
[03:25:13.080 --> 03:25:16.080]  It would send a message to the rest of them, but that's the problem
[03:25:16.080 --> 03:25:20.080]  And I think that until people in these organizations either band together
[03:25:20.080 --> 03:25:25.080]  Or stand up and do like the Department of Homeland Security tells us all to do
[03:25:25.080 --> 03:25:27.080]  You see something, say something
[03:25:27.080 --> 03:25:31.080]  Of course, they don't want you to say something about the corruption you're finding in government
[03:25:31.080 --> 03:25:35.080]  And they're more concerned about investigating those people who do speak out
[03:25:35.080 --> 03:25:37.080]  Than what they're speaking out against
[03:25:37.080 --> 03:25:41.080]  And while I tell you Colonel, I agree, and the answer is all of us start speaking out
[03:25:41.080 --> 03:25:44.080]  That's why you were saying before you went on air, look, I'm not a hero
[03:25:44.080 --> 03:25:47.080]  Don't talk about my Bronze Star and blah blah blah
[03:25:47.080 --> 03:25:52.080]  The point is in a world of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act
[03:25:52.080 --> 03:25:57.080]  George Arwell, you are a hero and everybody inside the system that speaks out
[03:25:57.080 --> 03:26:01.080]  And I know you've had some repercussions for speaking out, you are a hero
[03:26:01.080 --> 03:26:08.080]  Because studies show that political valor going up against peer pressure in the establishment
[03:26:08.080 --> 03:26:11.080]  Is more rare than physical valor
[03:26:11.080 --> 03:26:13.080]  Well thanks, I appreciate it, I think you're a hero
[03:26:13.080 --> 03:26:17.080]  In fact, you know, one of the things I hear a lot of people when they see a veteran
[03:26:17.080 --> 03:26:20.080]  They'll say thank you for your service, I want to thank you for your service
[03:26:20.080 --> 03:26:21.080]  Oh, well thank you
[03:26:21.080 --> 03:26:23.080]  Well I'm just trying to have a free country for my kids
[03:26:23.080 --> 03:26:27.080]  Exactly, and that's what I want to do is try and turn over something to my kids
[03:26:27.080 --> 03:26:30.080]  That was turned over to me from my father and mother's job
[03:26:30.080 --> 03:26:36.080]  Absolutely, it's an imperative that instinctively we stand against this
[03:26:36.080 --> 03:26:39.080]  I mean is that how you feel, it's just like a burning desire?
[03:26:39.080 --> 03:26:46.080]  I feel like the thing that scares me about this country is the same thing that scares Mike Mullen
[03:26:46.080 --> 03:26:50.080]  Admiral Mullen who is a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
[03:26:50.080 --> 03:26:54.080]  This was the most senior man in uniform in our country who said
[03:26:54.080 --> 03:27:00.080]  The most significant threat to this country isn't terrorism, it's our debt
[03:27:00.080 --> 03:27:06.080]  Raising the debt ceiling which has been done over a hundred times does not increase our debt
[03:27:06.080 --> 03:27:11.080]  It does not somehow promote proflicacy
[03:27:11.080 --> 03:27:16.080]  All it does is it says, you got to pay the bills that you've already racked up Congress
[03:27:16.080 --> 03:27:20.080]  When our country collapses, what do people think is going to happen economically?
[03:27:20.080 --> 03:27:24.080]  I thought it was interesting that during the last government shutdown
[03:27:24.080 --> 03:27:29.080]  That they had a quote unquote glitch in the EBT card system
[03:27:29.080 --> 03:27:31.080]  Where in about a dozen states and I'm sure you remember it
[03:27:31.080 --> 03:27:32.080]  It caused havoc
[03:27:32.080 --> 03:27:40.080]  Because people's EBT cards didn't work and a lot of Walmart's across the country had some serious problems
[03:27:40.080 --> 03:27:48.080]  And I think that was to send a message to the people who did not want to sign that law to raise the debt ceiling
[03:27:48.080 --> 03:27:52.080]  It was do you really want this to happen on your watch?
[03:27:52.080 --> 03:27:57.080]  Because this is what happens when people's EBT cards don't work for a few hours
[03:27:57.080 --> 03:28:04.080]  What do you think is going to happen when social security recipients, people on disability, veterans
[03:28:04.080 --> 03:28:09.080]  Everybody who works for a government agency suddenly doesn't get their check
[03:28:09.080 --> 03:28:12.080]  We're going to need those Bearcats
[03:28:12.080 --> 03:28:15.080]  And that's really, I don't have a problem with having Bearcats
[03:28:15.080 --> 03:28:19.080]  Because if they're going to collapse the government and you're going to see riots in the streets
[03:28:19.080 --> 03:28:24.080]  If our economy collapses, then sure, people are going to be wishing they had more Bearcats
[03:28:24.080 --> 03:28:28.080]  Well, that's where I was going and I want to hear who's controlling those Bearcats
[03:28:28.080 --> 03:28:31.080]  Who are the people at the top that are going to be given those orders?
[03:28:31.080 --> 03:28:35.080]  And we know it's going to be at the Tea Party who knew about the problems and tried to stop it
[03:28:35.080 --> 03:28:39.080]  It's going to be the Free Staters who knew about the problems and tried to stop it
[03:28:39.080 --> 03:28:47.080]  And that's the issue, is that I've said as things collapse and if Austin's burning, where we're talking today
[03:28:47.080 --> 03:28:51.080]  I would want the police to put down riots and protect my house
[03:28:51.080 --> 03:28:55.080]  The issue is though, the globalists lit the fuse of this
[03:28:55.080 --> 03:28:59.080]  The Federal Reserve devalued the dollar, they moved the world away from the dollar
[03:28:59.080 --> 03:29:05.080]  They did this and they think they're going to bring in the crisis and get total social control out of it
[03:29:05.080 --> 03:29:11.080]  They engineered it, so when it all collapses, which probably is inevitable now
[03:29:11.080 --> 03:29:15.080]  Probably too late to reverse it, Ron Paul said that on my show, and I agree with him
[03:29:15.080 --> 03:29:17.080]  We tried years ago
[03:29:17.080 --> 03:29:21.080]  Alright, so what you're listening to right now is Alex Jones' live interview here in the studio
[03:29:21.080 --> 03:29:23.080]  Of course, it went live today
[03:29:23.080 --> 03:29:26.080]  I see something, Marine Colonel Warren's of a takeover
[03:29:26.080 --> 03:29:29.080]  We have that article and the full interview went up today on Infowars.com
[03:29:29.080 --> 03:29:33.080]  We're going to be right back with more of this interview, you don't want to miss it
[03:29:33.080 --> 03:29:36.080]  This is a man of integrity talking about the corruption
[03:29:36.080 --> 03:29:40.080]  Talking about how you need to look at the corruption, you need to do something about it
[03:29:40.080 --> 03:29:48.080]  Stay with us, we'll be right back
[03:30:11.080 --> 03:30:17.080]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla and I've been solving tax problems for more than 30 years
[03:30:17.080 --> 03:30:21.080]  In fact, I wrote the book that made it possible to negotiate settlements with the IRS
[03:30:21.080 --> 03:30:24.080]  And I've helped thousands of people do exactly that

[03:30:38.080 --> 03:30:41.080]  There's no need for you to suffer another day with IRS debt

[03:32:09.080 --> 03:32:13.080]  Burglars call it smash and grab, police call it robbery
[03:32:13.080 --> 03:32:15.080]  We call it avoidable
[03:32:15.080 --> 03:32:21.080]  We are fake TV, a simple electronic device that can fool even professional burglars
[03:32:21.080 --> 03:32:26.080]  Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet and simulates the changing colors of a television
[03:32:26.080 --> 03:32:30.080]  To a burglar, it looks like someone must be home watching TV
[03:32:30.080 --> 03:32:33.080]  So they'll likely move on to an easier target
[03:32:33.080 --> 03:32:39.080]  At only $29.95, fake TV costs less than a month of most alarm monitoring plans
[03:32:39.080 --> 03:32:41.080]  And comes with free shipping
[03:32:41.080 --> 03:32:46.080]  Order your fake TV by calling 877-5-FAKE-TV

[03:33:04.080 --> 03:33:07.080]  Don't worry, this show is documented
[03:33:07.080 --> 03:33:11.080]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network
[03:33:11.080 --> 03:33:13.080]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show
[03:33:13.080 --> 03:33:18.080]  I'm David Knight, and this hour we're playing for you the report that premiered today on Infowars.com
[03:33:18.080 --> 03:33:23.080]  I see something, this is a Marine Colonel that we heard about first about a year ago
[03:33:23.080 --> 03:33:28.080]  When he spoke out about the Department of Homeland Security building a domestic army
[03:33:28.080 --> 03:33:32.080]  But it's about much more than that, and he talks about the corruption that we see
[03:33:32.080 --> 03:33:35.080]  And the corruption that he wants people to do something about
[03:33:35.080 --> 03:33:40.080]  Let's go back to that interview with Alex Jones and retired Colonel Pete Martino
[03:33:40.080 --> 03:33:43.080]  Is that I've said, as things collapse
[03:33:43.080 --> 03:33:46.080]  And if Austin's burning, where we're talking today
[03:33:46.080 --> 03:33:50.080]  I would want the police to put down riots and protect my house
[03:33:50.080 --> 03:33:54.080]  The issue is though, the globalists let the fuse of this
[03:33:54.080 --> 03:33:56.080]  The fellow reserve devalued the dollar
[03:33:56.080 --> 03:33:58.080]  They moved the world away from the dollar
[03:33:58.080 --> 03:34:01.080]  They did this, and they think they're going to bring in the crisis
[03:34:01.080 --> 03:34:04.080]  And get total social control out of it
[03:34:04.080 --> 03:34:06.080]  They engineered it
[03:34:06.080 --> 03:34:10.080]  So when it all collapses, which probably is inevitable now
[03:34:10.080 --> 03:34:13.080]  Probably too late to reverse it, Ron Paul said that on my show
[03:34:13.080 --> 03:34:15.080]  And I agree with him, we tried years ago
[03:34:15.080 --> 03:34:19.080]  The people that engineered this need to get the blame and go to prison
[03:34:19.080 --> 03:34:21.080]  So it doesn't happen again
[03:34:21.080 --> 03:34:24.080]  Instead we're going to end up with the engineers of this
[03:34:24.080 --> 03:34:26.080]  Who certainly exacerbated it
[03:34:26.080 --> 03:34:29.080]  Getting more power out of the crisis they created
[03:34:29.080 --> 03:34:32.080]  You know, the old days if you screwed up you got fired or in trouble
[03:34:32.080 --> 03:34:34.080]  Now they insulate themselves
[03:34:34.080 --> 03:34:37.080]  So what I want to do sir, because you're respectful and a nice guy
[03:34:37.080 --> 03:34:39.080]  You keep throwing it back to me
[03:34:39.080 --> 03:34:41.080]  I want to give you the floor now here
[03:34:41.080 --> 03:34:45.080]  For about 15-20 minutes to get into all these incredible points
[03:34:45.080 --> 03:34:47.080]  That you bring up about the average Marine corporal
[03:34:47.080 --> 03:34:49.080]  How much power do you want the president to have
[03:34:49.080 --> 03:34:51.080]  And the centralization of control
[03:34:51.080 --> 03:34:55.080]  Government as a racket, Smedley Butler, Noam Chomsky
[03:34:55.080 --> 03:35:00.080]  I want to give you the floor here to address the viewers out there, Colonel
[03:35:00.080 --> 03:35:02.080]  And really talk to folks
[03:35:02.080 --> 03:35:05.080]  Because I think in the final equation what you're getting at here is
[03:35:05.080 --> 03:35:09.080]  This is all a discussion we've got to have with ourselves, our families, everybody else
[03:35:09.080 --> 03:35:11.080]  This is a societal evolution
[03:35:11.080 --> 03:35:14.080]  We're going to the bottom of a decadence cycle
[03:35:14.080 --> 03:35:17.080]  And if good men and women don't get on deck
[03:35:17.080 --> 03:35:20.080]  To try to really have a soft landing
[03:35:20.080 --> 03:35:22.080]  Who knows where the world is going
[03:35:22.080 --> 03:35:25.080]  So I want to give you the floor here
[03:35:25.080 --> 03:35:29.080]  To basically do 10-15 minutes, 20-minute speech, whatever you want
[03:35:29.080 --> 03:35:32.080]  To the viewers out there and the listeners out there
[03:35:32.080 --> 03:35:34.080]  Going back to the integrity issue
[03:35:34.080 --> 03:35:37.080]  Here's another emission statement from our IRS
[03:35:37.080 --> 03:35:42.080]  Provide America's taxpayers top quality service
[03:35:42.080 --> 03:35:45.080]  By helping them understand and meet their tax responsibilities
[03:35:45.080 --> 03:35:49.080]  And force the law with integrity and fairness to all
[03:35:49.080 --> 03:35:53.080]  So when it comes to what does integrity look like
[03:35:53.080 --> 03:35:57.080]  If you look at our leadership, it's really shameful
[03:35:57.080 --> 03:36:00.080]  Our people deserve better than that
[03:36:00.080 --> 03:36:02.080]  Our veterans deserve better than that
[03:36:02.080 --> 03:36:05.080]  Our citizens deserve better than that
[03:36:05.080 --> 03:36:12.080]  We've had wars on poverty, drugs, war on terrorism
[03:36:12.080 --> 03:36:14.080]  And we're losing all of them
[03:36:14.080 --> 03:36:17.080]  But we never see a war on corruption, a war on abuse of power
[03:36:17.080 --> 03:36:19.080]  And a war on ignorance
[03:36:19.080 --> 03:36:22.080]  Not illiteracy but ignorance about what really goes on in this country
[03:36:22.080 --> 03:36:27.080]  And I think Alex, you do a great job of really, you've hit it right on the head
[03:36:27.080 --> 03:36:30.080]  Info wars, it's all about controlling information
[03:36:30.080 --> 03:36:34.080]  And people just don't get the facts, they don't get the information
[03:36:34.080 --> 03:36:36.080]  They don't really know what's going on out there
[03:36:36.080 --> 03:36:40.080]  And so I think that a war on ignorance is about teaching people
[03:36:40.080 --> 03:36:42.080]  How vulnerable they really are
[03:36:42.080 --> 03:36:45.080]  Toward mind control, manipulation and so on
[03:36:45.080 --> 03:36:49.080]  I read years ago that there was actually a psychology professor of all people
[03:36:49.080 --> 03:36:52.080]  Whose class decided to do an experiment on him
[03:36:52.080 --> 03:36:55.080]  And when he moved to the left side of the classroom
[03:36:55.080 --> 03:36:57.080]  They all perked up and looked interested
[03:36:57.080 --> 03:36:59.080]  When he moved to the right side of the classroom
[03:36:59.080 --> 03:37:02.080]  They all looked bored and falling, nodding off
[03:37:02.080 --> 03:37:04.080]  And by the end of a few classes
[03:37:04.080 --> 03:37:08.080]  He was teaching the entire class leaning against the left side of the wall
[03:37:08.080 --> 03:37:10.080]  On the left side of the classroom
[03:37:10.080 --> 03:37:12.080]  And this is the interesting part though
[03:37:12.080 --> 03:37:15.080]  When the students told him that they had manipulated him
[03:37:15.080 --> 03:37:17.080]  And that they put him there
[03:37:17.080 --> 03:37:20.080]  He outright refused to believe it
[03:37:20.080 --> 03:37:22.080]  He said that, no, I just like it over here better
[03:37:22.080 --> 03:37:24.080]  And I think that's what's going on in this country
[03:37:24.080 --> 03:37:29.080]  And the cure for or the way to inoculate people
[03:37:29.080 --> 03:37:34.080]  Against manipulation, against mind control, against influence
[03:37:34.080 --> 03:37:38.080]  Is to simply educate them about the process of how it's done
[03:37:38.080 --> 03:37:44.080]  And the real key is to get people to be willing to listen to other sides of an issue
[03:37:44.080 --> 03:37:47.080]  And stop being convinced that there are only two sides
[03:37:47.080 --> 03:37:51.080]  The government obviously keeps everybody fighting against each other
[03:37:51.080 --> 03:37:56.080]  Over distraction issues like abortion, gay rights, you name it
[03:37:56.080 --> 03:38:00.080]  If everybody could just take a break for one election cycle
[03:38:00.080 --> 03:38:02.080]  All these one issue voters out there
[03:38:02.080 --> 03:38:05.080]  And just make the one issue corruption
[03:38:05.080 --> 03:38:10.080]  And regardless of where your politicians stand on your particular issue
[03:38:10.080 --> 03:38:13.080]  If you can't trust them, then why are they your poster child?
[03:38:13.080 --> 03:38:18.080]  Why would you want to send somebody to Washington who is lied to your face?
[03:38:18.080 --> 03:38:23.080]  If you were an employer and an employee lied to you, stole from you
[03:38:23.080 --> 03:38:25.080]  How long would they last?
[03:38:25.080 --> 03:38:28.080]  If you had a neighborhood watch, would you give all the weapons to the one person
[03:38:28.080 --> 03:38:31.080]  In the neighborhood who lies to everybody who you can't trust
[03:38:31.080 --> 03:38:33.080]  Who's actually stolen from people?
[03:38:33.080 --> 03:38:35.080]  And so that's one of the things that concerns me
[03:38:35.080 --> 03:38:38.080]  And I think it's really that war on ignorance
[03:38:38.080 --> 03:38:43.080]  And really reminding people or educating people as to just how much corruption
[03:38:43.080 --> 03:38:46.080]  Has gone on in this country
[03:38:46.080 --> 03:38:51.080]  One of the solutions I think to fight this war on corruption
[03:38:51.080 --> 03:38:54.080]  And I see all the time out there on the internet
[03:38:54.080 --> 03:38:58.080]  There's a lot of people out there who talk about taking up arms against the government
[03:38:58.080 --> 03:39:00.080]  And starting a new revolution
[03:39:00.080 --> 03:39:03.080]  Well, I don't think we're ready for that yet
[03:39:03.080 --> 03:39:05.080]  I don't think that that's the way to do it
[03:39:05.080 --> 03:39:08.080]  I think that the war really needs to be about corruption
[03:39:08.080 --> 03:39:10.080]  And the way I would fight a war nowadays
[03:39:10.080 --> 03:39:13.080]  If I were to go try and take over a country
[03:39:13.080 --> 03:39:15.080]  I wouldn't send battalions or troops over
[03:39:15.080 --> 03:39:23.080]  I'd send battalions of students, journalists, business people, politicians, teachers, and so on
[03:39:23.080 --> 03:39:27.080]  And I would have them go into all those organizations within that country
[03:39:27.080 --> 03:39:30.080]  And it really comes down to a battle of ideas
[03:39:30.080 --> 03:39:32.080]  Over the water cooler, have discussions
[03:39:32.080 --> 03:39:35.080]  Let the best ideas rise to the top
[03:39:35.080 --> 03:39:38.080]  And really it's about educating people
[03:39:38.080 --> 03:39:40.080]  It's about doing the right thing
[03:39:40.080 --> 03:39:43.080]  And I think that if people really want to fight for this country
[03:39:43.080 --> 03:39:46.080]  If you work for a government agency
[03:39:46.080 --> 03:39:49.080]  You need to step up and you need to look around
[03:39:49.080 --> 03:39:50.080]  Read your mission statement
[03:39:50.080 --> 03:39:52.080]  If you're acting in conflict to that
[03:39:52.080 --> 03:39:54.080]  Then do something about it
[03:39:54.080 --> 03:39:56.080]  If you're told not to
[03:39:56.080 --> 03:39:59.080]  Then go to your supervisor, go to your supervisor's supervisor
[03:39:59.080 --> 03:40:03.080]  Until the time comes when enough people band together
[03:40:03.080 --> 03:40:05.080]  To turn some of these agencies around
[03:40:05.080 --> 03:40:08.080]  And we start demanding that people be held accountable
[03:40:08.080 --> 03:40:12.080]  One of the things that bothers me about abuse of power
[03:40:12.080 --> 03:40:14.080]  Is it causes so much damage
[03:40:14.080 --> 03:40:17.080]  When you kill or abuse one innocent person
[03:40:17.080 --> 03:40:19.080]  It creates 10 new enemies
[03:40:19.080 --> 03:40:22.080]  And I think that's what we do with this global war on terrorism
[03:40:22.080 --> 03:40:25.080]  I think that's what we do with a lot of our police departments out there
[03:40:25.080 --> 03:40:29.080]  You always have that 10% in any organization that we talk about
[03:40:29.080 --> 03:40:32.080]  As the ones that are the problem children
[03:40:32.080 --> 03:40:35.080]  But the reality is a lot of times it's more than 10%
[03:40:35.080 --> 03:40:38.080]  And in our government agencies
[03:40:38.080 --> 03:40:42.080]  That other 90% needs to clean up their house
[03:40:42.080 --> 03:40:46.080]  And unfortunately a lot of times I think that 10% is at the top
[03:40:46.080 --> 03:40:47.080]  So it's going to be hard
[03:40:47.080 --> 03:40:51.080]  Another thing that I think might be a small first step
[03:40:51.080 --> 03:40:54.080]  Is wouldn't it be nice if somebody would sponsor a bill
[03:40:54.080 --> 03:40:58.080]  And we passed a law to add the oath to tell the truth
[03:40:58.080 --> 03:41:00.080]  To the oath of office
[03:41:00.080 --> 03:41:04.080]  And what that would mean is basically anytime a politician
[03:41:04.080 --> 03:41:07.080]  Or a government bureaucrat who takes an oath of office
[03:41:07.080 --> 03:41:10.080]  Is speaking publicly or representing their office
[03:41:10.080 --> 03:41:13.080]  Whether it's to the people or the media
[03:41:13.080 --> 03:41:14.080]  That they're under oath
[03:41:14.080 --> 03:41:16.080]  And that they're subject to the laws of perjury
[03:41:16.080 --> 03:41:18.080]  Subject to the penalty of perjury
[03:41:18.080 --> 03:41:21.080]  And why don't we have mandatory sentences
[03:41:21.080 --> 03:41:26.080]  And so I think if we could just clean up our politicians and bureaucrats
[03:41:26.080 --> 03:41:32.080]  It's a small step because I'm sure they'd work around lying to us
[03:41:32.080 --> 03:41:35.080]  Maybe they'd just shut up which wouldn't be a bad thing either
[03:41:35.080 --> 03:41:38.080]  I'd rather have them not say anything than to just lie to us
[03:41:38.080 --> 03:41:40.080]  But eventually organizations
[03:41:40.080 --> 03:41:43.080]  Whether it's a military organization or unit or company
[03:41:43.080 --> 03:41:46.080]  Or corporation or bureaucracy or a country
[03:41:46.080 --> 03:41:50.080]  Eventually organizations take on the qualities
[03:41:50.080 --> 03:41:53.080]  And characteristics of their leaders
[03:41:53.080 --> 03:41:57.080]  There's an old saying that an army of deer led by a lion
[03:41:57.080 --> 03:42:00.080]  Is more to be feared than an army of lions led by a deer
[03:42:00.080 --> 03:42:03.080]  And if you look at the people who are leading us
[03:42:03.080 --> 03:42:04.080]  Where are they taking us?
[03:42:04.080 --> 03:42:06.080]  When you look at some of the qualities of our leaders
[03:42:06.080 --> 03:42:09.080]  We need to take a closer look of who's representing you
[03:42:09.080 --> 03:42:12.080]  These are the people who represent us around the world
[03:42:12.080 --> 03:42:17.080]  We had an ambassador to Belgium who was an accused pedophile
[03:42:17.080 --> 03:42:21.080]  And there was an internal memo that was found
[03:42:21.080 --> 03:42:23.080]  Or became public a while back
[03:42:23.080 --> 03:42:27.080]  That said that Howard Govman would frequently try to ditch his security detail
[03:42:27.080 --> 03:42:31.080]  And solicit sex from prostitutes and minor children
[03:42:31.080 --> 03:42:34.080]  And yet the investigation into that was quashed
[03:42:34.080 --> 03:42:36.080]  By high level members in the State Department
[03:42:36.080 --> 03:42:39.080]  Secretary of State Clinton at the time
[03:42:39.080 --> 03:42:42.080]  Said that the first she heard about it was in the media
[03:42:42.080 --> 03:42:46.080]  Now my question is okay well once you did finally hear about it
[03:42:46.080 --> 03:42:48.080]  What did you do about it?
[03:42:48.080 --> 03:42:51.080]  Doesn't it concern anybody that the one person
[03:42:51.080 --> 03:42:54.080]  Who's representing the entire United States
[03:42:54.080 --> 03:42:58.080]  To the people of Belgium could be molesting their kids?
[03:42:58.080 --> 03:43:02.080]  Mr. President you're telling me that that's the best person
[03:43:02.080 --> 03:43:05.080]  You could find to be an ambassador for us to represent us
[03:43:05.080 --> 03:43:10.080]  Jeffrey Tubin said that Govman was a Washington super lawyer
[03:43:10.080 --> 03:43:13.080]  Who bought his ambassadorship through massive contributions
[03:43:13.080 --> 03:43:16.080]  To the Obama campaign and Mr. President
[03:43:16.080 --> 03:43:18.080]  You couldn't find a Secretary of State
[03:43:18.080 --> 03:43:21.080]  Of all the qualified people in this country
[03:43:21.080 --> 03:43:23.080]  Who wouldn't have to read it in the newspaper
[03:43:23.080 --> 03:43:26.080]  That one of our ambassadors could be a child molester
[03:43:26.080 --> 03:43:29.080]  Another thing that I'm curious about is
[03:43:29.080 --> 03:43:32.080]  These ambassadors that are political appointees
[03:43:32.080 --> 03:43:35.080]  It's interesting that they never seem to end up
[03:43:35.080 --> 03:43:38.080]  In places like Benghazi or things like that
[03:43:38.080 --> 03:43:41.080]  And if they did I wonder if we'd spend more money to protect them
[03:43:41.080 --> 03:43:44.080]  Or maybe make more of an effort to protect them
[03:43:44.080 --> 03:43:45.080]  If they were in danger
[03:43:45.080 --> 03:43:48.080]  What difference at this point does it make?
[03:43:48.080 --> 03:43:50.080]  It continues to come back to trust
[03:43:50.080 --> 03:43:52.080]  And if you look at our politicians
[03:43:52.080 --> 03:43:55.080]  You can go all the way back or as far back as you want
[03:43:55.080 --> 03:43:58.080]  To look at lies that have been told to the American public
[03:43:58.080 --> 03:44:02.080]  And Herbert Hoover said that the economy was great
[03:44:02.080 --> 03:44:04.080]  And everything was wonderful
[03:44:04.080 --> 03:44:07.080]  And a week later the stock market crashed
[03:44:07.080 --> 03:44:09.080]  And we entered the Great Depression
[03:44:09.080 --> 03:44:12.080]  President Kennedy said that we weren't conducting
[03:44:12.080 --> 03:44:16.080]  Any type of operations or anything against Cuba
[03:44:16.080 --> 03:44:20.080]  The next day an American pilot was shot down over Cuba
[03:44:20.080 --> 03:44:23.080]  President Johnson lied to us about the Gulf of Tonkin incident
[03:44:23.080 --> 03:44:25.080]  And that was highly classified
[03:44:25.080 --> 03:44:27.080]  It was only recently that top secret documents
[03:44:27.080 --> 03:44:30.080]  Were released that confirmed what a lot of people knew
[03:44:30.080 --> 03:44:33.080]  And that was that the Gulf of Tonkin incident was a lie
[03:44:33.080 --> 03:44:37.080]  And it was just used to justify going to war in Vietnam
[03:44:37.080 --> 03:44:40.080]  And how many thousands of people died over that war
[03:44:40.080 --> 03:44:45.080]  If somebody at the time had informed people about that
[03:44:45.080 --> 03:44:48.080]  That would have been a violation of their top secret clearance
[03:44:48.080 --> 03:44:50.080]  And they'd be in a prison cell today
[03:44:50.080 --> 03:44:53.080]  Or maybe sharing a room in Russia with Edward Snowden
[03:44:53.080 --> 03:44:56.080]  We've also had Ronald Reagan who said
[03:44:56.080 --> 03:44:59.080]  We did not trade arms for hostages
[03:44:59.080 --> 03:45:03.080]  Bill Clinton, I did not have sex with that woman
[03:45:03.080 --> 03:45:09.080]  And for those who say that a politician's sex life shouldn't matter
[03:45:09.080 --> 03:45:11.080]  I agree to a point
[03:45:11.080 --> 03:45:15.080]  But the problem is if President Clinton was willing to lie
[03:45:15.080 --> 03:45:18.080]  To his own cabinet to the entire country
[03:45:18.080 --> 03:45:22.080]  About his sexual relationships that he did not want made public
[03:45:22.080 --> 03:45:25.080]  What else would he have done if one of our enemies
[03:45:25.080 --> 03:45:28.080]  Found out about that and maybe they did, who knows
[03:45:28.080 --> 03:45:32.080]  But how much pressure could those people put on him to do things
[03:45:32.080 --> 03:45:35.080]  If you're trying to hide something like that
[03:45:35.080 --> 03:45:37.080]  Look at all of our politicians out there
[03:45:37.080 --> 03:45:40.080]  Who may have some of these skeletons in their closet
[03:45:40.080 --> 03:45:43.080]  And so lies are lies
[03:45:43.080 --> 03:45:46.080]  When you look at President Bush, I will not
[03:45:46.080 --> 03:45:49.080]  Read my lips
[03:45:49.080 --> 03:45:53.080]  No more taxes
[03:45:53.080 --> 03:45:55.080]  Read my lips, no more taxes
[03:45:55.080 --> 03:45:59.080]  We also heard from his son about weapons of mass destruction
[03:45:59.080 --> 03:46:03.080]  Those weapons of mass destruction gotta be somewhere
[03:46:03.080 --> 03:46:06.080]  President Obama, you can keep your insurance
[03:46:06.080 --> 03:46:08.080]  You can keep your doctor
[03:46:08.080 --> 03:46:12.080]  Noam Chomsky once said that the reason that a lot of governments
[03:46:12.080 --> 03:46:16.080]  Classify information isn't necessarily to keep it from their enemies
[03:46:16.080 --> 03:46:18.080]  Who in many cases already know
[03:46:18.080 --> 03:46:21.080]  But it's to keep it from their own people
[03:46:21.080 --> 03:46:25.080]  General Smedley Butler, the only Marine to be awarded
[03:46:25.080 --> 03:46:27.080]  The Medal of Honor twice
[03:46:27.080 --> 03:46:30.080]  Wrote a book, War is a Racket
[03:46:30.080 --> 03:46:33.080]  And I know you're familiar with it, Alex
[03:46:33.080 --> 03:46:36.080]  But after World War I
[03:46:36.080 --> 03:46:39.080]  Smedley Butler did some research and found that that war
[03:46:39.080 --> 03:46:43.080]  Created over 21,000 billionaires and millionaires
[03:46:43.080 --> 03:46:47.080]  During a time when the frontline troops were being paid $30 a month
[03:46:47.080 --> 03:46:51.080]  And he said that the key to ending war would be simple
[03:46:51.080 --> 03:46:53.080]  Take the profit out of it
[03:46:53.080 --> 03:46:56.080]  He said if you conscripted labor, capital
[03:46:56.080 --> 03:46:58.080]  Everything that's needed for the war effort
[03:46:58.080 --> 03:47:03.080]  And paid CEOs, politicians, generals, admirals
[03:47:03.080 --> 03:47:05.080]  Everybody on down the same thing
[03:47:05.080 --> 03:47:07.080]  That the private fighting the war is being paid
[03:47:07.080 --> 03:47:09.080]  Announced that 30 days ahead of time
[03:47:09.080 --> 03:47:11.080]  And he said there'll be no war
[03:47:11.080 --> 03:47:15.080]  And I'd be curious to see how long the war on terrorism would last
[03:47:15.080 --> 03:47:18.080]  If CEOs of some of these defense contractors
[03:47:18.080 --> 03:47:24.080]  Private security companies were making $1,500 a month
[03:47:24.080 --> 03:47:27.080]  Instead of eight figure salaries in some cases
[03:47:27.080 --> 03:47:29.080]  And that's another concern
[03:47:29.080 --> 03:47:31.080]  Is the privatization of the military
[03:47:31.080 --> 03:47:33.080]  What we're seeing is that in the past
[03:47:33.080 --> 03:47:35.080]  A lot of these government contractors
[03:47:35.080 --> 03:47:37.080]  In the military industrial complex
[03:47:37.080 --> 03:47:40.080]  Provided materials and equipment to fight our wars
[03:47:40.080 --> 03:47:43.080]  Huge profiteering was taking place
[03:47:43.080 --> 03:47:45.080]  But nowadays we're not only these companies
[03:47:45.080 --> 03:47:48.080]  Are providing materials to fight the wars
[03:47:48.080 --> 03:47:50.080]  But people themselves
[03:47:50.080 --> 03:47:53.080]  A lot of our support troops are slowly being replaced
[03:47:53.080 --> 03:47:56.080]  By private contractors, people from other countries
[03:47:56.080 --> 03:47:58.080]  Even third-world countries in some cases
[03:47:58.080 --> 03:48:02.080]  And so these folks are actually out there
[03:48:02.080 --> 03:48:04.080]  On the battlefield
[03:48:04.080 --> 03:48:06.080]  If you look at what happened in Fallujah
[03:48:06.080 --> 03:48:07.080]  The whole thing that sparked that
[03:48:07.080 --> 03:48:09.080]  If it wasn't for four blackwater employees
[03:48:09.080 --> 03:48:12.080]  Getting killed and dragged through the streets of Fallujah
[03:48:12.080 --> 03:48:15.080]  Nobody would have ever even heard of that city
[03:48:15.080 --> 03:48:17.080]  And some of the questions to ask are
[03:48:17.080 --> 03:48:18.080]  What were they doing there
[03:48:18.080 --> 03:48:20.080]  Why weren't they adequately prepared
[03:48:20.080 --> 03:48:22.080]  Even though the CEO of the company
[03:48:22.080 --> 03:48:24.080]  May have been making eight figures a year
[03:48:24.080 --> 03:48:26.080]  What was the amount of that money
[03:48:26.080 --> 03:48:28.080]  Was trickling down to be able for these people
[03:48:28.080 --> 03:48:30.080]  To actually do their job safely
[03:48:30.080 --> 03:48:32.080]  And I think the message that was being sent
[03:48:32.080 --> 03:48:34.080]  To the Iraqi people is
[03:48:34.080 --> 03:48:36.080]  Hey, those people need to get the same respect
[03:48:36.080 --> 03:48:37.080]  Our military does
[03:48:37.080 --> 03:48:39.080]  Don't mess with them or we're going to mess back
[03:48:39.080 --> 03:48:42.080]  How many Marines were killed in that first battle of Fallujah
[03:48:42.080 --> 03:48:45.080]  Battle of Fallujah before the President pulled them out
[03:48:45.080 --> 03:48:47.080]  And then went back in
[03:48:47.080 --> 03:48:50.080]  And fought a second battle over the same ground
[03:48:50.080 --> 03:48:53.080]  Only to lose the entire country now
[03:48:53.080 --> 03:48:56.080]  To the very people we said we were going there to fight
[03:48:56.080 --> 03:48:58.080]  Who weren't even there when we got there
[03:48:58.080 --> 03:49:00.080]  I think if General Butler were alive today
[03:49:00.080 --> 03:49:02.080]  He'd conclude that government is a racket
[03:49:02.080 --> 03:49:04.080]  If you look at what's destroying this country
[03:49:04.080 --> 03:49:05.080]  It's all the corruption
[03:49:05.080 --> 03:49:08.080]  The reason we've got a $17 trillion debt
[03:49:08.080 --> 03:49:10.080]  Is because of all the money that's been looted
[03:49:10.080 --> 03:49:12.080]  From our government, from the taxpayer
[03:49:12.080 --> 03:49:15.080]  All the promises that were made to my parents' generation
[03:49:15.080 --> 03:49:17.080]  For Social Security and so on
[03:49:17.080 --> 03:49:19.080]  That money's been raided, that money's gone
[03:49:19.080 --> 03:49:22.080]  Now that it's time to start paying those bills
[03:49:22.080 --> 03:49:25.080]  And to start paying those people what they were promised
[03:49:25.080 --> 03:49:27.080]  That money's not there
[03:49:27.080 --> 03:49:30.080]  And if there's one thing that has unified Democrats and Republicans
[03:49:30.080 --> 03:49:32.080]  And everybody in between
[03:49:32.080 --> 03:49:34.080]  Is that we all hated the bank bailout
[03:49:34.080 --> 03:49:36.080]  I think the question that people need to ask themselves
[03:49:36.080 --> 03:49:40.080]  Is how much power and authority do you really want your leaders to have
[03:49:40.080 --> 03:49:43.080]  And when the President of the United States
[03:49:43.080 --> 03:49:46.080]  Claims the authority to be able to kill
[03:49:46.080 --> 03:49:48.080]  An American citizen anywhere in the world
[03:49:48.080 --> 03:49:51.080]  Any time just by declaring them a terrorist
[03:49:51.080 --> 03:49:53.080]  Without any due process
[03:49:53.080 --> 03:49:55.080]  That should concern people
[03:49:55.080 --> 03:49:57.080]  And I think it concerns a lot of people
[03:49:57.080 --> 03:50:00.080]  But apparently not enough to do anything about it
[03:50:00.080 --> 03:50:03.080]  When the most powerful person in the Senate
[03:50:03.080 --> 03:50:06.080]  Calls an American citizen a terrorist
[03:50:06.080 --> 03:50:09.080]  A domestic terrorist like he did with Clive and Bundy
[03:50:09.080 --> 03:50:12.080]  Over a dispute about grazing fees
[03:50:12.080 --> 03:50:15.080]  An issue that's going on in courts
[03:50:15.080 --> 03:50:17.080]  An issue that involves money and so on
[03:50:17.080 --> 03:50:19.080]  And declares him a terrorist
[03:50:19.080 --> 03:50:21.080]  What message is he saying
[03:50:21.080 --> 03:50:24.080]  He's basically telling the President of the United States
[03:50:24.080 --> 03:50:26.080]  Hey, here's one over here
[03:50:26.080 --> 03:50:29.080]  Does that mean that the President is now going to send in a drone
[03:50:29.080 --> 03:50:32.080]  And kill Clive and Bundy or some other people
[03:50:32.080 --> 03:50:35.080]  And so I think that's something that people need to pay attention to
[03:50:35.080 --> 03:50:38.080]  If you think it's okay for the President of the United States
[03:50:38.080 --> 03:50:40.080]  To be able to kill you
[03:50:40.080 --> 03:50:42.080]  And you can sleep at night with that
[03:50:42.080 --> 03:50:44.080]  Then hey, that's fine
[03:50:44.080 --> 03:50:47.080]  But think about the crop of politicians here
[03:50:47.080 --> 03:50:51.080]  We're listening to retired Marine Colonel Pete Martino
[03:50:51.080 --> 03:50:53.080]  And we're going to be back with the final part of that
[03:50:53.080 --> 03:50:55.080]  He's a man of integrity
[03:50:55.080 --> 03:50:58.080]  Just like a retired Marine, Smedley Butler
[03:50:58.080 --> 03:51:00.080]  And what they can't stand is corruption
[03:51:00.080 --> 03:51:01.080]  We'll be right back
[03:51:01.080 --> 03:51:03.080]  The human body is extraordinary
[03:51:03.080 --> 03:51:05.080]  Despite all the stresses we inflict upon it
[03:51:05.080 --> 03:51:07.080]  It still works hard to stay in balance
[03:51:07.080 --> 03:51:09.080]  Thousands upon thousands of people
[03:51:09.080 --> 03:51:11.080]  Relay upon hardened body extract
[03:51:11.080 --> 03:51:13.080]  To help their bodies stay balanced

[03:51:18.080 --> 03:51:20.080]  Promotes good circulation
[03:51:20.080 --> 03:51:22.080]  Balances cholesterol and more

[03:53:21.080 --> 03:53:23.080]  Have you ever wondered why bank stockbrokers
[03:53:23.080 --> 03:53:26.080]  Investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[03:53:26.080 --> 03:53:27.080]  Wait a sec
[03:53:27.080 --> 03:53:28.080]  Gold and silver is going up
[03:53:28.080 --> 03:53:31.080]  While Congress is trying to settle on the next dead increase

[03:53:33.080 --> 03:53:35.080]  That old 401K and IRA

[03:54:04.080 --> 03:54:06.080]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show
[03:54:06.080 --> 03:54:08.080]  Now we premiered today an article
[03:54:08.080 --> 03:54:10.080]  As well as an interview that Alex Jones had
[03:54:10.080 --> 03:54:13.080]  With retired Marine Colonel Pete Martino
[03:54:13.080 --> 03:54:15.080]  And this is the final segment
[03:54:15.080 --> 03:54:16.080]  If you want to see this
[03:54:16.080 --> 03:54:17.080]  You can see it on infowars.com
[03:54:17.080 --> 03:54:20.080]  Both the video and Colonel Martino's article
[03:54:20.080 --> 03:54:22.080]  In an interview
[03:54:22.080 --> 03:54:24.080]  But think about the crap of politicians here
[03:54:24.080 --> 03:54:25.080]  That are running for president
[03:54:25.080 --> 03:54:26.080]  Think about the politicians
[03:54:26.080 --> 03:54:28.080]  In the opposite political party
[03:54:28.080 --> 03:54:29.080]  That you might belong to
[03:54:29.080 --> 03:54:31.080]  Do you want George W. Bush
[03:54:31.080 --> 03:54:33.080]  To have the authority to kill you?
[03:54:33.080 --> 03:54:35.080]  Did you want President Bill Clinton
[03:54:35.080 --> 03:54:37.080]  To have the power to kill you?
[03:54:37.080 --> 03:54:38.080]  Do you want President Obama
[03:54:38.080 --> 03:54:40.080]  To have the power to kill you?
[03:54:40.080 --> 03:54:41.080]  Do you want any of these candidates
[03:54:41.080 --> 03:54:42.080]  That are running for president
[03:54:42.080 --> 03:54:45.080]  To have the power to kill you?
[03:54:45.080 --> 03:54:47.080]  And that's something that everybody needs
[03:54:47.080 --> 03:54:49.080]  To take a real sobering look at
[03:54:49.080 --> 03:54:51.080]  You really want your president
[03:54:51.080 --> 03:54:53.080]  To have the authority to kill you
[03:54:53.080 --> 03:54:55.080]  Because that's what it comes down to
[03:54:55.080 --> 03:54:56.080]  And you're saying
[03:54:56.080 --> 03:54:58.080]  Well, yeah, he can go kill a terrorist
[03:54:58.080 --> 03:54:59.080]  Well, I'm not a terrorist
[03:54:59.080 --> 03:55:00.080]  So I don't have anything to worry about
[03:55:00.080 --> 03:55:02.080]  And it's just like the people say
[03:55:02.080 --> 03:55:03.080]  Well, if you don't have anything to hide
[03:55:03.080 --> 03:55:05.080]  You shouldn't care or have anything to worry about
[03:55:05.080 --> 03:55:07.080]  That the NSA is monitoring
[03:55:07.080 --> 03:55:09.080]  Every aspect of your life
[03:55:09.080 --> 03:55:11.080]  And it's not that you have anything to hide
[03:55:11.080 --> 03:55:13.080]  It's not that you're doing anything wrong
[03:55:13.080 --> 03:55:15.080]  But the problem is
[03:55:15.080 --> 03:55:18.080]  People get the wrong message out of 1984
[03:55:18.080 --> 03:55:20.080]  It's really about finding people's fears
[03:55:20.080 --> 03:55:22.080]  Finding people's weaknesses
[03:55:22.080 --> 03:55:24.080]  So they can be exploited
[03:55:24.080 --> 03:55:26.080]  You know, maybe you're very close
[03:55:26.080 --> 03:55:28.080]  To a certain person or a certain relative
[03:55:28.080 --> 03:55:29.080]  Maybe you didn't do anything wrong
[03:55:29.080 --> 03:55:30.080]  But maybe they did
[03:55:30.080 --> 03:55:32.080]  And now they can use that to get to you
[03:55:32.080 --> 03:55:34.080]  And so we shouldn't be
[03:55:34.080 --> 03:55:35.080]  Under this level of surveillance
[03:55:35.080 --> 03:55:37.080]  And it's total hypocrisy
[03:55:37.080 --> 03:55:39.080]  To try and tell the American people
[03:55:39.080 --> 03:55:42.080]  That we need this level of surveillance
[03:55:42.080 --> 03:55:43.080]  On our entire population
[03:55:43.080 --> 03:55:46.080]  Because the threat is so significant
[03:55:46.080 --> 03:55:48.080]  And yet at the same time
[03:55:48.080 --> 03:55:50.080]  The very agency
[03:55:50.080 --> 03:55:52.080]  The Department of Homeland Security
[03:55:52.080 --> 03:55:54.080]  That's trying to put the fear into everybody
[03:55:54.080 --> 03:55:56.080]  That's trying to terrorize the American people
[03:55:56.080 --> 03:55:58.080]  Into believing that there's a terrorist
[03:55:58.080 --> 03:55:59.080]  Around every corner
[03:55:59.080 --> 03:56:01.080]  And that your local police department
[03:56:01.080 --> 03:56:03.080]  Needs to have an armored military vehicle
[03:56:03.080 --> 03:56:05.080]  In order to deal with it
[03:56:05.080 --> 03:56:06.080]  When at the same time
[03:56:06.080 --> 03:56:08.080]  We've got people walking across our borders
[03:56:08.080 --> 03:56:10.080]  Unchecked, not only unchecked
[03:56:10.080 --> 03:56:12.080]  But assisted by our own government
[03:56:12.080 --> 03:56:14.080]  And being shipped all over the country
[03:56:14.080 --> 03:56:16.080]  This is a biological attack
[03:56:16.080 --> 03:56:17.080]  We've got diseases
[03:56:17.080 --> 03:56:19.080]  We've got people who are literally walking
[03:56:19.080 --> 03:56:21.080]  Biological weapons being sent
[03:56:21.080 --> 03:56:23.080]  All around the country
[03:56:23.080 --> 03:56:26.080]  And if that's not
[03:56:26.080 --> 03:56:27.080]  Impeachable offenses
[03:56:27.080 --> 03:56:29.080]  If this isn't even treason
[03:56:29.080 --> 03:56:31.080]  Then I'm not sure what is
[03:56:31.080 --> 03:56:33.080]  The average Marine corporal has more integrity
[03:56:33.080 --> 03:56:35.080]  I think than all of Washington
[03:56:35.080 --> 03:56:38.080]  And they swore an oath to defend the Constitution
[03:56:38.080 --> 03:56:41.080]  Not the country, not the government
[03:56:41.080 --> 03:56:42.080]  Not even their families
[03:56:42.080 --> 03:56:44.080]  But the Constitution, the ideas
[03:56:44.080 --> 03:56:45.080]  That are in there
[03:56:45.080 --> 03:56:46.080]  If you're one of those people
[03:56:46.080 --> 03:56:48.080]  Who always says to a veteran
[03:56:48.080 --> 03:56:49.080]  Hey, thank you for your service
[03:56:49.080 --> 03:56:50.080]  If you want to thank a veteran
[03:56:50.080 --> 03:56:52.080]  Get a copy of the Constitution
[03:56:52.080 --> 03:56:53.080]  Read it
[03:56:53.080 --> 03:56:55.080]  Help defend it here at home
[03:56:55.080 --> 03:56:58.080]  Demand that your politicians
[03:56:58.080 --> 03:56:59.080]  Read the Constitution
[03:56:59.080 --> 03:57:00.080]  And start to live by it
[03:57:00.080 --> 03:57:01.080]  And vote by it
[03:57:01.080 --> 03:57:03.080]  They deserve better
[03:57:03.080 --> 03:57:04.080]  I think maybe that's why
[03:57:04.080 --> 03:57:06.080]  Homeland Security sees veterans
[03:57:06.080 --> 03:57:07.080]  As a threat
[03:57:07.080 --> 03:57:09.080]  Because they know what's in the Constitution
[03:57:09.080 --> 03:57:10.080]  When I was a battalion commander
[03:57:10.080 --> 03:57:12.080]  The very first thing I did
[03:57:12.080 --> 03:57:14.080]  Was issue everybody in my battalion
[03:57:14.080 --> 03:57:16.080]  A copy of the Constitution
[03:57:16.080 --> 03:57:17.080]  A pocket version
[03:57:17.080 --> 03:57:18.080]  And told them to carry it with them
[03:57:18.080 --> 03:57:19.080]  All the time
[03:57:19.080 --> 03:57:21.080]  I want to thank Colonel Pete Martino
[03:57:21.080 --> 03:57:22.080]  For doing what he's doing
[03:57:22.080 --> 03:57:24.080]  Standing up, being a man
[03:57:24.080 --> 03:57:26.080]  Fighting here in the Republic
[03:57:26.080 --> 03:57:28.080]  Here in the homeland
[03:57:28.080 --> 03:57:30.080]  Against the takeover we see unfolding
[03:57:30.080 --> 03:57:32.080]  And I want to talk to all of you out there
[03:57:32.080 --> 03:57:34.080]  Remember that whether you are
[03:57:34.080 --> 03:57:35.080]  A Marine Corps Colonel
[03:57:35.080 --> 03:57:36.080]  With a bronze star
[03:57:36.080 --> 03:57:37.080]  Whether you're a school teacher
[03:57:37.080 --> 03:57:39.080]  Whether you're an auto mechanic
[03:57:39.080 --> 03:57:41.080]  Black, white, old, young, Hispanic
[03:57:41.080 --> 03:57:42.080]  I don't care
[03:57:42.080 --> 03:57:45.080]  Muslim, Christian, Jew, agnostic
[03:57:45.080 --> 03:57:46.080]  Liberty beats in the breast
[03:57:46.080 --> 03:57:48.080]  Of every man and woman out there
[03:57:48.080 --> 03:57:49.080]  Who's not evil
[03:57:49.080 --> 03:57:51.080]  And most of us are not evil inherently
[03:57:51.080 --> 03:57:53.080]  We just are ignorant
[03:57:53.080 --> 03:57:55.080]  And we've been afraid to stand up
[03:57:55.080 --> 03:57:56.080]  And be leaders
[03:57:56.080 --> 03:57:58.080]  We're going to lose everything, ladies and gentlemen
[03:57:58.080 --> 03:58:00.080]  If we don't stand up
[03:58:00.080 --> 03:58:01.080]  And speak out now
[03:58:01.080 --> 03:58:04.080]  And get back to the basic American values
[03:58:04.080 --> 03:58:06.080]  That made this country so great
[03:58:06.080 --> 03:58:08.080]  And made our nation the model of the world
[03:58:08.080 --> 03:58:10.080]  So Colonel, I salute you
[03:58:10.080 --> 03:58:12.080]  And your wife, we're coming to Austin to talk to us
[03:58:12.080 --> 03:58:14.080]  Thank you so much for your time tonight
[03:58:14.080 --> 03:58:16.080]  Thank you, Alex, pleasure, anytime
[03:58:16.080 --> 03:58:18.080]  Alright, so you just heard the interview
[03:58:18.080 --> 03:58:20.080]  That Alex had here in the studio
[03:58:20.080 --> 03:58:22.080]  With Colonel Pete Martino
[03:58:22.080 --> 03:58:24.080]  He pointed out that Smidley Butler said war is a racket
[03:58:24.080 --> 03:58:27.080]  Colonel Martino said government has become a racket
[03:58:27.080 --> 03:58:29.080]  Racketeering, influence and corruption
[03:58:29.080 --> 03:58:31.080]  And we have a statute to take care of
[03:58:31.080 --> 03:58:33.080]  That is called the Declaration of Independence
[03:58:33.080 --> 03:58:36.080]  Come back and see us tomorrow at 11 central
[03:58:36.080 --> 03:58:38.080]  And we'll be back with Alex Jones tomorrow
