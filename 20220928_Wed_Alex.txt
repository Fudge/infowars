[00:00.000 --> 00:11.440]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going
[00:11.440 --> 00:18.400]  to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you got one!
[00:18.400 --> 00:48.320]  In the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:48.320 --> 00:55.280]  After Europe approved the COVID vaccine for kids, excessive deaths among children increased
[00:55.280 --> 01:01.640]  by 755%.
[01:01.640 --> 01:06.960]  Recent studies now prove that the COVID vaccines are being transmitted to children through
[01:06.960 --> 01:13.760]  the vaccinated mother's breast milk.
[01:13.760 --> 01:19.560]  A recent Harvard study shows that the COVID vaccines are far more dangerous than COVID
[01:19.560 --> 01:24.720]  19 itself.
[01:24.720 --> 01:30.720]  And the CDC has quietly acknowledged all this.
[01:30.720 --> 01:37.360]  All of these facts were once explicitly labeled false by the mainstream narrative.
[01:37.360 --> 01:43.960]  The awakening masses are now aware that these experimental vaccines are deadly and that we
[01:43.960 --> 01:50.840]  are all being lied to, but we still don't know what these mysterious poisons are doing
[01:50.840 --> 01:52.880]  to our bodies.
[01:52.880 --> 01:58.680]  Macroscopic research has shown us that some of these vaccines contain graphene oxide and
[01:58.680 --> 02:04.520]  what appears to be self-assembling nanotech.
[02:04.520 --> 02:10.880]  Morticians have found massive, inorganic, so-called clots growing inside the vascular
[02:10.880 --> 02:18.720]  systems of the deceased vaccinated, and the FDA has been using transhumanist slogans to
[02:18.720 --> 02:23.400]  push the latest COVID booster shots.
[02:23.400 --> 02:28.200]  So it isn't surprising that people are now questioning the vaccine when it comes to a
[02:28.200 --> 02:35.360]  strange new phenomenon being captured by security cameras from around the world.
[02:35.360 --> 02:40.120]  Several videos show people suffering from the same strange attack.
[02:40.120 --> 02:45.040]  First, they act as if they see something over their shoulder, compelling them to turn their
[02:45.040 --> 02:46.040]  head.
[02:46.040 --> 02:53.200]  As the head turns, the body follows, an arm lifts as if to point at what they are seeing.
[02:53.200 --> 03:20.200]  Their body then spirals into collapse and begins to spasm.
[03:20.200 --> 03:45.680]  Spinning their head to see something, and then spinning into collapse.
[03:45.680 --> 04:08.600]  These videos do not appear to be a hoax, and if they are not a hoax, then what is this?
[04:08.600 --> 04:28.800]  It has people speculating about 5G, and has others thinking about CERN.
[04:28.800 --> 04:34.240]  Whatever it is that is going on, we are still injecting this deadly poison into the young
[04:34.240 --> 04:37.760]  bodies of our innocent children.
[04:37.760 --> 05:01.440]  Coming for InfoWars, this is Greg Rees.
[05:01.440 --> 05:10.480]  Look around you, everything I predicted from the Globlestone documents from their own admissions
[05:10.480 --> 05:14.480]  has never been higher, and it is because of your backing of this operation that I could
[05:14.480 --> 05:20.000]  steadfastly, despite the censorship, and the boycotts, and the attacks, and the lawsuits
[05:20.000 --> 05:26.120]  stay on air, but now we are reaching the most critical juncture in the fight together.
[05:26.120 --> 05:31.280]  So I want to ask all of you today to help keep me on the air.
[05:31.280 --> 05:35.200]  In my decades on air, I have never asked for personal donations, but I am being forced by
[05:35.200 --> 05:40.720]  the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees, and I can't fund those myself.
[05:40.720 --> 05:41.720]  It is unsustainable.
[05:41.720 --> 05:51.560]  So please, visit saveinfowars.com, where you can make straight donations, $5, $10, $500,
[05:51.560 --> 05:54.280]  whatever you can, so that I can continue to persevere.
[05:54.280 --> 05:57.480]  I'll never give up, I'll never give in, but I could give out.
[05:57.480 --> 05:58.480]  Thank you for your support.
[05:58.480 --> 06:26.400]  Wouldn't be without you, saveinfowars.
[06:26.400 --> 06:37.160]  The answer to the first question for us, if Germany, if Russia invades, that means tanks
[06:37.160 --> 06:48.040]  or troops crossing the border of Ukraine again, then there will be no longer a Nord Stream
[06:48.040 --> 06:49.040]  tube.
[06:49.040 --> 06:52.800]  We will bring it into it.
[06:52.800 --> 07:00.760]  But how will you do that, exactly, since the project and control of the project is within
[07:00.760 --> 07:03.160]  Germany's control?
[07:03.160 --> 07:09.920]  We will, I promise you, we'll be able to do it.
[07:09.920 --> 07:17.200]  With regard to Nord Stream tube, we continue to have very strong and clear conversations
[07:17.200 --> 07:22.000]  with our German allies, and I want to be clear with you today.
[07:22.000 --> 07:33.960]  If Russia invades Ukraine, one way or another Nord Stream tube will not move forward.
[07:33.960 --> 07:39.440]  The CIA two weeks ago told the German government, the number one paper in Germany's reporting
[07:39.440 --> 07:45.400]  to Spiegel, that the Ukrainians would blow up the Nord Stream pipeline in the Baltic
[07:45.400 --> 07:49.840]  Sea to cut money off to Russia.
[07:49.840 --> 07:54.680]  Germany was on the verge of opening Nord Stream tube despite all the pressure by NATO and the
[07:54.680 --> 07:59.720]  United States because they have 800 to 900 percent higher energy bills going into the
[07:59.720 --> 08:01.720]  fall and winter.
[08:01.720 --> 08:07.480]  Now, if you look at Kibono and Latin who benefits from this, Russia doesn't benefit, Europe
[08:07.480 --> 08:12.880]  doesn't benefit, but the globalist faction that wants to use Ukraine as the detonator
[08:12.880 --> 08:18.720]  to collapse Europe and bring in what they're calling Marshall Plan 2 to give unlimited trillions
[08:18.720 --> 08:25.400]  to the central banks, to themselves, they stand again from this.
[08:25.400 --> 08:30.960]  Because again, they need conflict, they need lockdowns, they need pretext to cause the
[08:30.960 --> 08:36.640]  world depression to bring in the global central bank digital currencies that will operate
[08:36.640 --> 08:41.240]  according to carbon taxes and a social credit score and a vaccine passport.
[08:41.240 --> 08:45.080]  It's all official, the head of the European Union announced again yesterday we have the
[08:45.080 --> 08:55.000]  clip that they are accelerating to a European Union issued digital token currency that is
[08:55.000 --> 08:59.880]  programmable, that surveils you and decides where you can spend it, when you can spend
[08:59.880 --> 09:04.440]  it, how you can spend it and for how long you can spend it and they can value and devalue
[09:04.440 --> 09:05.440]  it in a lifetime.
[09:05.440 --> 09:08.600]  That's the official announcement, have you ever wanted to know what the market of the
[09:08.600 --> 09:09.960]  beast looks like?
[09:09.960 --> 09:14.360]  This is it, the Federal Reserve came out as you know, two days ago the private Federal
[09:14.360 --> 09:18.360]  Reserve head said that the United States is developing its own and will be deploying
[09:18.360 --> 09:26.720]  it very, very soon and quote it will not be private, it will not be quote anonymous.
[09:26.720 --> 09:32.360]  So it's here, as I told you, it's not coming, it's here and people say well how did you
[09:32.360 --> 09:36.460]  know this 20 years ago, you must be one of their agents, 20 years ago they were writing
[09:36.460 --> 09:43.560]  about this plan, ladies and gentlemen, that's why after a decade of studying Bitcoin I finally
[09:43.560 --> 09:46.920]  in the last three, four years said yeah I support it because we need to support independent
[09:46.920 --> 09:56.160]  open currencies that are not tied to the central banks and if you look at Ethereum, well I'm
[09:56.160 --> 10:00.240]  not against Ethereum, I'm just saying it's gotten in line now with the central banks
[10:00.240 --> 10:04.280]  and it's streamlining things where it's not going to be anonymous and where they have
[10:04.280 --> 10:09.000]  these six shareholders and stakeholders that basically control it and I'm not saying it's
[10:09.000 --> 10:15.160]  going to end up being the basis of the central bank digital programmable currencies but
[10:15.160 --> 10:19.920]  this is just huge, so that's one of the big giant issues, the pipeline, what's happening
[10:19.920 --> 10:24.080]  with that, the latest in Russia, the unbelievable awakening around the planet with nationalists
[10:24.080 --> 10:28.200]  and populists getting elected everywhere, that's very positive news, the UN as I told
[10:28.200 --> 10:32.240]  you two and a half years ago, this was coming, when the first world collapses and the third
[10:32.240 --> 10:37.080]  world dies, they just ended lock down six months ago, hell three, four months ago, places
[10:37.080 --> 10:42.280]  like Australia, but in Latin America, in many areas of Asia, the Middle East, they just
[10:42.280 --> 10:47.400]  started ending these a few months ago and after two plus years of being locked down,
[10:47.400 --> 10:57.520]  they're devastated, UN food chief warns of hell on earth from famine, big report by Mike
[10:57.520 --> 11:09.440]  Adams up on the infowar.tv and infowars.com, this is so central and if your average soulless
[11:09.440 --> 11:14.400]  leftist doesn't care about third world populations, we should depopulate, they're collapsing,
[11:14.400 --> 11:21.240]  they're coming here to swamp us, so it is a big, big deal and speaking of the UN, out
[11:21.240 --> 11:30.400]  of all these clips, the first thing I wanna play is Jacinda Arden, the puppet WEF globalist
[11:30.400 --> 11:37.360]  who is the second most favorite after Trudeau of Canada, she spoke yesterday to the UN and
[11:37.360 --> 11:44.360]  said we must censor everyone and we must only have one voice on the vaccines that aren't
[11:44.360 --> 11:52.560]  vaccines and on climate change and on globalism, she said free speech is a weapon of war, everything
[11:52.560 --> 11:57.440]  she said was a lie, everything she said was a fraud, she's a globalist operative and she
[11:57.440 --> 12:03.640]  says their main mission is silencing us, well of course, the hellish system that they're
[12:03.640 --> 12:10.240]  bringing in to control us cannot operate with free speech, that's why the democrat party
[12:10.240 --> 12:15.360]  Sandy Hook lawyers say take Alex Jones out, silence him and then silence everyone else
[12:15.360 --> 12:20.800]  like him with these precedents that they're setting of rigged show trials where they show
[12:20.800 --> 12:27.040]  no evidence against me, I can't put on any of my own evidence and now they had one of
[12:27.040 --> 12:31.680]  the women up there that never said her name yesterday testifying on people sending them
[12:31.680 --> 12:36.080]  pictures of random dead kids, never said this woman's name, never told anybody send her
[12:36.080 --> 12:41.360]  pictures of dead kids, but the jury's told it's my fault that she's a public figure
[12:41.360 --> 12:46.200]  and was out there with Obama supporting gun control and then somebody sends her a picture
[12:46.200 --> 12:51.840]  of a dead kid and it's my fault and I need to be shut down, I need to be silenced, that's
[12:51.840 --> 12:55.360]  all coming up, but let me just get this out there right now, I want to thank viewers and
[12:55.360 --> 12:58.640]  listeners for keeping us on the air over the years, you're amazing, you're incredible,
[12:58.640 --> 13:03.160]  all I want to do is stay in the fight, couldn't have done it without you and we are in chapter
[13:03.160 --> 13:07.160]  five bankruptcy, which means we don't get liquidated, we don't get shut down, it means
[13:07.160 --> 13:12.560]  I get paid very little which is fine with me and the crew stays here and this operation
[13:12.560 --> 13:16.840]  goes forward and if there's any extra money in the future after the appeals going for
[13:16.840 --> 13:22.440]  years and the rest of it, then some of that money will go to these folks, a tax on us
[13:22.440 --> 13:26.400]  being able to tell the truth, but they don't want that, they've said in Connecticut and
[13:26.400 --> 13:30.960]  in Texas we want him silenced off the air, they've gone to the bankruptcy court and said
[13:30.960 --> 13:34.200]  we want Alex Jones taken off the air now, we want it liquidated, we want it shut down,
[13:34.200 --> 13:37.400]  we don't want to sell the product as warehouse, we want to put chains on the doors, they've
[13:37.400 --> 13:42.680]  said this on TV, you've seen it, so the mission is keep us on air, so we can go through these
[13:42.680 --> 13:47.760]  show trials, we believe we'll probably very easily beat what they've done in Connecticut
[13:47.760 --> 13:54.080]  and Texas at the state supreme courts because what they've done is just 100% fraudulent
[13:54.080 --> 14:00.680]  and completely out of control, just outrageous, talk to main line top lawyers, top people,
[14:00.680 --> 14:05.920]  they said this is just insane, even the Connecticut supreme court who's left us, they're going
[14:05.920 --> 14:11.040]  to overturn this stuff, it's insane, so the mission is there, keep us on air, go through
[14:11.040 --> 14:16.680]  the bankruptcy, but if we don't bring enough money in the next, because it was a 13 week
[14:16.680 --> 14:21.280]  plan and then it got held up, they removed the CRO that the court had basically put
[14:21.280 --> 14:26.520]  in there, not an issue with us, they're putting in another one, we're very transparent here,
[14:26.520 --> 14:30.040]  they've already reported to the court that there's almost no money, that's all coming
[14:30.040 --> 14:33.680]  out now, so you'll hear the plaintiff's lawyers lying and saying I've got hundreds of millions
[14:33.680 --> 14:38.160]  of dollars anymore or 10 million dollars, this is not true, and soon it's going to be
[14:38.160 --> 14:42.680]  published in the court, my net worth, they're going to be shocked by how little I have,
[14:42.680 --> 14:47.560]  so in fact I'm in the negative if you add actually things I owe versus what I have,
[14:47.560 --> 14:52.680]  and so this is a full on fight right now to stay on air, you've invested so much time
[14:52.680 --> 14:56.880]  and energy and word of mouth and you've been proven right supporting this broadcast, now
[14:56.880 --> 15:00.040]  basically the baby's nine months pregnant or the mama's nine months pregnant, the baby's

[20:01.240 --> 20:21.800]  Leading up frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:21.800 --> 20:27.520]  How many times in the last few months did I say the globalists would blow up the Nordstream
[20:27.520 --> 20:34.080]  2 pipeline, they've also damaged the Nordstream that was open, Russia doesn't gain, people
[20:34.080 --> 20:40.160]  of Europe don't gain, but the New World Order destabilizing does gain, and it turns out
[20:40.160 --> 20:47.440]  the Navy with the Navy Seals two months ago did drills in the exact same spot of underwater
[20:47.440 --> 20:55.840]  demolition, I have the news articles admitting it, mainstream news here in the stack, so
[20:55.840 --> 21:01.880]  when you hear, oh, only Ukraine could have done it because they stand again cutting off
[21:01.880 --> 21:09.280]  Russia's supply of money, when you hear Ukraine, remember who runs the Ukraine war, the globalists
[21:09.280 --> 21:14.640]  that run the Pentagon at the top, World War 3 watch, the CIA warned Germany that Ukraine
[21:14.640 --> 21:21.080]  was planning to blow up Nordstream pipeline weeks ago, why would they report on themselves
[21:21.080 --> 21:27.120]  because they want you to think Ukraine acted alone, I love our military, I love our country
[21:27.120 --> 21:32.120]  but I do not love the people running the policy of our government, I knew back in October
[21:32.120 --> 21:37.040]  of last year, US Special Forces troops didn't give me the details, but multiple people I
[21:37.040 --> 21:44.200]  know personally who were shipping out to Ukraine, and then I looked at a lot of different publicly
[21:44.200 --> 21:48.800]  available data, and the fact that the Russians would not be able to invade after February
[21:48.800 --> 21:56.760]  because the ground gets soft, and they need to roll in when it's still frozen, a lot of
[21:56.760 --> 22:01.280]  their tanks still got stuck because it warmed up a little quicker, and so I said by late
[22:01.280 --> 22:05.280]  February I believe they'll invade, they did, that's what critical thinking allows you
[22:05.280 --> 22:10.320]  to do, and again, go back two and a half years ago, I said supply chain breakdowns will be
[22:10.320 --> 22:14.360]  horrible in the West, it will destroy most small businesses and medium-sized businesses,
[22:14.360 --> 22:17.640]  it will consolidate and double and triple the profits of the big central banks and places
[22:17.640 --> 22:24.000]  like Amazon, and the box stores, Walmart, Target, it will kill the medium-sized facilities,
[22:24.000 --> 22:27.320]  consolidate power and control, but the big thing it will do is starve the third world
[22:27.320 --> 22:33.440]  to death en masse, the numbers are usually six months behind, in the first year of lockdowns
[22:33.440 --> 22:37.000]  they estimated over 40 extra million people starved to death, last number we got more
[22:37.000 --> 22:44.760]  than six months ago was 60 plus million extra people starved to death in the last two years,
[22:44.760 --> 22:50.200]  and they've done surveys in Europe and in the US in places like Texas and Arizona where
[22:50.200 --> 22:55.000]  nine out of ten of the illegal alien migrants are asked why are you here, and they say I
[22:55.000 --> 23:00.560]  worked on a farm, I worked on a ranch, and it's been closed for years and they slaughtered
[23:00.560 --> 23:04.640]  the cattle and they killed the milk cows, or I worked in a factory, it's been shut down,
[23:04.640 --> 23:09.800]  I have to come here, and most of them really are refugees from globalism and I feel for
[23:09.800 --> 23:14.120]  them, but the criminals, the coyotes, the smugglers that make money off of it and kill
[23:14.120 --> 23:17.560]  the innocent people and torture them, and then the left and the Democrats getting these
[23:17.560 --> 23:21.400]  millions of people, hundreds of thousands of children that just disappear into these
[23:21.400 --> 23:29.120]  labyrinths, this is human smuggling on a gargantuan scale, UN food chief warns of hell on earth
[23:29.120 --> 23:35.640]  from famine, hundreds of millions starved to death now, full report on infowars.com,
[23:35.640 --> 23:46.080]  so with all of this going on and all of this stuff happening, Jacinda Arden, the darling,
[23:46.080 --> 23:52.320]  the number two of Klaus Schwab, the one he brags about the most after Justin Trudeau,
[23:52.320 --> 23:58.160]  she addresses the UN and says there will be only one source of truth and free speech because
[23:58.160 --> 24:03.280]  any other speech is a weapon of war, she calls for censorship, citizens who think and speak
[24:03.280 --> 24:10.360]  for themselves are a danger to the new normal, talk about terrifying, this is the stuff of
[24:10.360 --> 24:15.160]  1984 on steroids, here she is in New York City.
[24:15.160 --> 24:21.120]  Also this week we launched an initiative alongside companies and nonprofits to help improve research
[24:21.120 --> 24:28.120]  and understanding of how a person's online experiences are curated by automated processes,
[24:28.120 --> 24:33.520]  this will also be important in understanding more about myths and disinformation online,
[24:33.520 --> 24:40.080]  a challenge that we must as leaders address, sadly I think it's easy to dismiss this problem
[24:40.080 --> 24:46.240]  as one in the margins, I can certainly understand the desire to leave it to someone else, as
[24:46.240 --> 24:51.680]  leaders we're rightly concerned that even the most light touch approaches to disinformation
[24:51.680 --> 24:59.600]  could be misinterpreted as being hostile to values of free speech that we value so highly,
[24:59.600 --> 25:04.240]  but while I cannot tell you today what the answer is to this challenge, I can say with
[25:04.240 --> 25:10.640]  complete certainty that we cannot ignore it, to do so poses an equal threat to the norms
[25:10.640 --> 25:17.680]  we all value, after all how do you successfully end a war, if people are led to believe the
[25:17.680 --> 25:24.040]  reason for its existence is not only legal but noble, how do you tackle climate change
[25:24.040 --> 25:29.000]  if people do not believe it exists, how do you ensure the human rights of others are
[25:29.000 --> 25:35.800]  upheld when they are subjected to hateful and dangerous rhetoric and ideology, the weapons
[25:35.800 --> 25:42.160]  may be different but the goals of those who perpetuate them is often the same, to cause
[25:42.160 --> 25:48.440]  chaos and reduce the ability of others to defend themselves, to disband communities,
[25:48.440 --> 25:54.200]  to collapse the collective strength of countries who work together, but we have an opportunity
[25:54.200 --> 25:59.920]  here to ensure that these particular weapons of war do not become an established part of
[25:59.920 --> 26:08.440]  warfare, in these times I am acutely aware of how easy it is to feel disheartened, we
[26:08.440 --> 26:16.000]  are facing many battles on many fronts, but there is cause for optimism, because for every
[26:16.000 --> 26:22.320]  new weapon we face there is a new tool to overcome it, for every attempt to push the
[26:22.320 --> 26:29.240]  world into chaos is a collective conviction to bring us back to order, we have the means
[26:29.240 --> 26:34.440]  we just need the collective will.
[26:34.440 --> 26:38.840]  So she says we have automated systems to censor people in live time, we need to stop
[26:38.840 --> 26:42.040]  these people with their free speech that are disbanding communities, who is breaking down
[26:42.040 --> 26:45.040]  the local communities, who is shutting down the small businesses, who puts people under
[26:45.040 --> 26:49.360]  lock down, see the WEF came out desperately months ago and said they are hiring hundreds
[26:49.360 --> 26:54.960]  of thousands of information warriors with the UN to censor people that question any
[26:54.960 --> 27:00.880]  of their agenda, biomedical tyranny, forced injections, open borders, stolen elections,
[27:00.880 --> 27:06.440]  the wars, and they had an FBI agent assigned to the Pentagon who is involved in regime
[27:06.440 --> 27:10.680]  change around the world on the stand last week saying I need to be taken off the air
[27:10.680 --> 27:17.520]  because I am a danger and I am a weapon, but he is actually an expert in using information
[27:17.520 --> 27:22.520]  as a weapon, I just talked common sense, my information is powerful because it is true,
[27:22.520 --> 27:29.120]  it resonates, theirs is based on lies and it can't succeed if you have speech, again
[27:29.120 --> 27:34.360]  you can teach a college course on that two minute clip, everything she said was an inversion
[27:34.360 --> 27:39.600]  of reality, they are launching wars, they are trying to keep the wars going, they don't
[27:39.600 --> 27:43.480]  want peace, they are trying to censor their opposition, they want to lock you up in your
[27:43.480 --> 27:48.160]  house, give you a digital ID, they are actually pushing this and everything coming out of
[27:48.160 --> 27:53.680]  her mouth, it is not for the people of New Zealand or not for the people of the world,
[27:53.680 --> 27:58.800]  but it is Klaus Schwab in the New World Order agenda with everybody from Trudeau to her,
[27:58.800 --> 28:03.880]  to hundreds of other leaders they have in their pocket saying the number one enemy is you
[28:03.880 --> 28:08.160]  having speech, that is why we are the number one enemy because we are seen as the populist
[28:08.160 --> 28:18.200]  example, info wars as the prototype, juggernaut of independence, though we are ragtag, though
[28:18.200 --> 28:22.840]  we are small in comparison, we have the truth and that frightens these criminals, so they
[28:22.840 --> 28:27.400]  are very core, that is why you have got to take the live feed from infowars.com, and
[28:27.400 --> 28:31.840]  end up sharing it and take clips out and share it on rumble, share it on gab and share it
[28:31.840 --> 28:35.920]  on the enemy platforms, twitter and facebook and instagram and google because it is a war
[28:35.920 --> 28:39.760]  and I see you fighting and I see what you are doing and I salute you and I thank you,
[28:39.760 --> 28:47.480]  but you heard her declaration of war against you, it is that simple, saveinfowars.com,

[29:11.680 --> 29:18.560]  that is info wars, think about how info wars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and
[29:18.560 --> 29:26.240]  Ball Sonaro and other foreign leaders like Nigel Farage as being the main impetus towards
[29:26.240 --> 29:32.480]  firing up their main base to defeat the new world order, the only reason humanity is still
[29:32.480 --> 29:38.000]  in the fight today is because the viewers and listeners of this broadcast have taken

[33:27.440 --> 33:35.120]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance, live from the infowars.com
[33:35.120 --> 33:38.120]  studios, it's Alex Jones.
[33:38.120 --> 33:46.120]  All right, Joe Scalgen is a really smart individual when it comes to geopolitical systems and
[33:46.120 --> 33:51.560]  collapsing civilizations, supply chain breakdowns, and the third world disintegration.
[33:51.560 --> 33:57.360]  They'll be covering all those topics with us in the third hour today.
[33:57.360 --> 34:00.680]  Yesterday I had pressing issues, I had to deal with it, I had to go off air, Owen got
[34:00.680 --> 34:03.880]  here very quickly and took over, hopefully that won't happen today because I meant to
[34:03.880 --> 34:05.880]  take phone calls yesterday.
[34:05.880 --> 34:10.080]  We're going to be taking phone calls for the entire second hour, I'm going to take a lot
[34:10.080 --> 34:15.120]  of them, so I'll give the number out in the last segment, next segment, coming up so we
[34:15.120 --> 34:19.880]  can get everybody online who wants to talk about all these big issues we're raising,
[34:19.880 --> 34:27.560]  the pipeline, the war, the open UN attacks on free speech, the hurricane coming in and
[34:27.560 --> 34:32.280]  the left lying and saying we have record hurricanes, they're actually low compared to what happened
[34:32.280 --> 34:33.280]  previous to the 60s.
[34:33.280 --> 34:35.680]  I have all those statistics here.
[34:35.680 --> 34:39.920]  We've got a lot of new pedophiles, Jeffrey Epstein news that needs to come out, we've
[34:39.920 --> 34:47.800]  got Russia news, we've got AI news, we've got so much to cover here today.
[34:47.800 --> 34:53.920]  Now I wanted to just play a smattering of clips that just illustrate the disdain that
[34:53.920 --> 35:00.240]  the establishment has for us, not just the high level globalist like Prince Charles or
[35:00.240 --> 35:05.120]  people like Bill Gates or Klaus Schwab, but put the minions in the media and in local
[35:05.120 --> 35:07.400]  government that rule over us.
[35:07.400 --> 35:13.000]  And the first clip, they say a picture can tell a thousand words, well this short 28
[35:13.000 --> 35:16.880]  second clip tells a million words.
[35:16.880 --> 35:22.840]  Here you have this mayor who's tried to forcibly inject the public, who's who who blames everything
[35:22.840 --> 35:28.360]  on racism, who promised to get elected to unify the people being just as bad as the
[35:28.360 --> 35:35.960]  last horrible mayor, saying New York's great, New York's doing great, you need to come here,
[35:35.960 --> 35:40.120]  we've got a brand and places like Kansas don't have a brand.
[35:40.120 --> 35:41.800]  Now here's the deal.
[35:41.800 --> 35:48.040]  New York has amazing restaurants, amazing theaters, incredible museums.
[35:48.040 --> 35:52.200]  I like New York, I've been going to New York since I was a kid and New York used to have
[35:52.200 --> 35:57.280]  all this energy and was open and free and dangerous, but still real.
[35:57.280 --> 36:01.640]  The people of New York on average are great people, I love what's real New Yorkers.
[36:01.640 --> 36:09.240]  But let me tell you, New York is known for crime and known for murder now and known for
[36:09.240 --> 36:15.160]  police that can't even respond to major crimes, New York is known for tyranny, New York is
[36:15.160 --> 36:20.440]  known for rats and garbage all over the place, New York is known for not being able to pay
[36:20.440 --> 36:25.160]  even with a decent income for housing, New York is known for as being a horrible place
[36:25.160 --> 36:27.320]  for children.
[36:27.320 --> 36:30.240]  What is Kansas known for?
[36:30.240 --> 36:36.620]  Farmers and ranchers and happy people and low crime and beautiful sunsets and hunting
[36:36.620 --> 36:42.120]  and fishing and maybe that's the problem for people like the mayor of New York, maybe
[36:42.120 --> 36:46.360]  he's never been to Kansas, maybe he doesn't know what Kansas is like.
[36:46.360 --> 36:49.360]  Kansas is a place you don't want to go to because you might not come back if you're
[36:49.360 --> 36:50.360]  out in a rural area.
[36:50.360 --> 36:52.600]  Does it have problems with the cities?
[36:52.600 --> 36:55.440]  Absolutely, all our cities do, we're a cursed nation.
[36:55.440 --> 37:00.640]  We need to get back to God and stop that, but folks had a heyday on Twitter and put
[37:00.640 --> 37:05.720]  up beautiful shots of the moon and sunsets and fishing and their families and factories
[37:05.720 --> 37:13.240]  and businesses and farms and it just shows that for some reason the pod people who many
[37:13.240 --> 37:19.440]  of them, they're not all pod people that live in these high rises in New York and DC and
[37:19.440 --> 37:24.560]  San Francisco that are hellish by any metric, some of the worst cities to live in in the
[37:24.560 --> 37:31.080]  world, but they really believe those of us that live in rural areas are bad or crazy
[37:31.080 --> 37:32.080]  or stupid.
[37:32.080 --> 37:36.360]  People understand that the really rich people don't live in the big cities anymore, maybe
[37:36.360 --> 37:39.840]  they got condos or houses, they're there a few months out of the year, they are trying
[37:39.840 --> 37:45.880]  to live in rural areas and raise their children there and there's a rush to the countryside
[37:45.880 --> 37:47.920]  and a rush out of New York City.
[37:47.920 --> 37:51.560]  So yeah, New York has a brand and that is collapse.
[37:51.560 --> 37:58.600]  New York has a brand escaped from New York and so here's a clip of the mayor literally
[37:58.600 --> 38:04.360]  laughing and joking as if for his city to be better, somebody else has got to be lower,
[38:04.360 --> 38:09.280]  but that's the new world order, collapse everything and then just feel happy that you're the mayor
[38:09.280 --> 38:11.640]  on top of it all, here it is.
[38:11.640 --> 38:20.800]  We have a brand, New York has a brand and when people see it, it means something.
[38:20.800 --> 38:38.120]  You know when we go there, it's not, Kansas doesn't have a brand, but New York has a brand,
[38:38.120 --> 38:41.520]  they has a brand.
[38:41.520 --> 38:46.960]  So the globalists have run that once great city from the big apple into the rotten apple
[38:46.960 --> 38:53.600]  and then they want to make everybody feel good by laughing at another American state.
[38:53.600 --> 38:57.240]  Absolutely disgusting.
[38:57.240 --> 39:03.000]  Here is a clip of a popular YouTube channel that does towing test with pickup trucks and
[39:03.000 --> 39:07.800]  of course the Ford Ranger would do 10 times the job that the new Ford Lightning EV pickup
[39:07.800 --> 39:12.800]  did because it has no torque, which is the whole point of a pickup truck.
[39:12.800 --> 39:17.120]  We're not going to play much of it, but here is the towing disaster.
[39:17.120 --> 39:19.640]  That's almost 90 miles of range and 30 miles.
[39:19.640 --> 39:22.640]  Are you serious?
[39:22.640 --> 39:25.560]  That's nuts.
[39:25.560 --> 39:26.560]  What a joke.
[39:26.560 --> 39:30.920]  Welcome to Hoopies Garage, the dumbest automotive channel in all of YouTube and this is my new
[39:30.920 --> 39:40.400]  2023 Ford F-150 Lightning electric pickup truck and it is towing my new 1930 Ford Model
[39:40.400 --> 39:45.040]  A pickup truck that I bought from my show Car Issues on Motor Trend.
[39:45.040 --> 39:51.440]  Now I towed with the Model A today quite a distance and it was a complete and total
[39:51.440 --> 39:56.560]  disaster from beginning to end, starting with having to film this video out of order because
[39:56.560 --> 39:58.760]  it was raining so hard.
[39:58.760 --> 40:03.800]  So I already know what's happened, but past 2V is in for a huge surprise when it comes
[40:03.800 --> 40:06.680]  to towing with this electric Ford Lightning.
[40:06.680 --> 40:07.880]  So let's start with the specs.
[40:07.880 --> 40:12.040]  This is the standard range battery, lariat, so it's the luxury model.
[40:12.040 --> 40:16.120]  So he goes over the whole truck for like five minutes and then he goes out and he can't
[40:16.120 --> 40:18.560]  get the car above 25 miles an hour.
[40:18.560 --> 40:19.920]  I'm going to say that again.
[40:19.920 --> 40:25.160]  He's towing a light payload, a little old Ford truck that I guarantee you has five times
[40:25.160 --> 40:30.520]  the power of that new Ford truck and it won't go past 20 something miles an hour.
[40:30.520 --> 40:32.960]  I mean this is a disaster.
[40:32.960 --> 40:39.880]  This is a joke, who on earth would put something like this out?
[40:39.880 --> 40:42.640]  Because again, it's not meant to replace things.
[40:42.640 --> 40:46.560]  It's meant to make you think they're replacing the coal power plants and the cars and the
[40:46.560 --> 40:52.760]  rest of it when they're not doing that, ladies and gentlemen.
[40:52.760 --> 40:56.120]  Is there any point in even showing this, the full video is on infowars.com, it's 12 and
[40:56.120 --> 40:59.800]  a half minutes long, can't get the car up past 20 something miles an hour.
[40:59.800 --> 41:00.800]  Here, go ahead and play some more.
[41:00.800 --> 41:15.240]  All right, pulling into my neighborhood and we got the driving range low warning, 50 miles
[41:15.240 --> 41:16.240]  remaining.
[41:16.240 --> 41:18.240]  Are you kidding me?
[41:18.240 --> 41:20.960]  That's almost 90 miles of range in 30 miles.
[41:20.960 --> 41:21.960]  Are you serious?
[41:21.960 --> 41:22.960]  That's nuts.
[41:22.960 --> 41:23.960]  Okay, that's good.
[41:23.960 --> 41:24.960]  What a joke.
[41:24.960 --> 41:33.320]  So later he's able to get it up, I guess going partially downhill to 40, but the issue is
[41:33.320 --> 41:38.160]  they use 90 miles of energy in just a few miles.
[41:38.160 --> 41:42.040]  So go see if yourself, it's an absolute total disaster.
[41:42.040 --> 41:47.840]  A Volkswagen towing a trailer with that weight would do a better job, a Volkswagen Beetle.
[41:47.840 --> 41:50.240]  I mean this is an insane disaster.
[41:50.240 --> 41:55.720]  Go see if yourself, popular YouTuber, test Ford EV pickup towing capacity, it fails spectacularly.
[41:55.720 --> 41:58.480]  Hell, some golf courts have better power.
[41:58.480 --> 42:03.640]  Okay, I'm going to come back with more of these clips that tie it all together.
[42:03.640 --> 42:07.320]  Remember when they were offering free burgers and fries, if you took your shot, I want to
[42:07.320 --> 42:08.800]  go back to that.
[42:08.800 --> 42:13.880]  We're also going to get to MSNBC's Joy Reid, the first Floridians evacuating illegal to
[42:13.880 --> 42:18.880]  illegal immigrants crossing the border, and then we'll also get to clip 13, CNN's Don
[42:18.880 --> 42:23.760]  Lemon to NOAA, what effect does climate change have on this phenomenon?
[42:23.760 --> 42:27.960]  And he gets absolutely destroyed, again trying to claim that there are more hurricanes and
[42:27.960 --> 42:32.680]  they're more intense when actually the opposite has been happening because of the sun cycles.
[42:32.680 --> 42:39.240]  It's all coming up today, and so much more, the pipeline blown up, what does that signify?
[42:39.240 --> 42:43.280]  If you thought Europe already had big problems, where is this going?
[42:43.280 --> 42:46.040]  Federal Reserve head says they're coming out with digital currency, it'll track everything
[42:46.040 --> 42:47.720]  you do and control what you do.
[42:47.720 --> 42:51.600]  I mean, it is just all out on the open now, and then your phone calls.
[42:51.600 --> 43:19.600]  Call me, come back, I'll give the number out, infowars.com, band.video.
[43:19.600 --> 43:25.920]  Now we're reaching the most critical juncture in the fight together, so I want to ask all
[43:25.920 --> 43:29.560]  of you today to help keep me on the air.
[43:29.560 --> 43:33.400]  In my decades on air, I've never asked for personal donations, but I've been forced
[43:33.400 --> 43:39.000]  by the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees, and I can't fund those myself.
[43:39.000 --> 43:47.400]  It's unsustainable, so please visit saveinfowars.com, saveinfowars.com, where you can make straight
[43:47.400 --> 43:51.800]  donations, five, ten, fifty hundred dollars, whatever you can, so that I can continue to

[43:52.800 --> 43:55.800]  I'll never give up, I'll never give in, but I could give out.

[48:17.360 --> 48:18.360]  do it.
[48:18.360 --> 48:24.800]  Now, getting back to the insanity of New York, for TV viewers, again here's a screenshot
[48:24.800 --> 48:29.400]  of the video we already played of the mayor laughing and making fun of people that live
[48:29.400 --> 48:34.880]  in Kansas saying what do they got, what do they got, they don't have a brand, they're
[48:34.880 --> 48:40.840]  not the big fancy New York City being destroyed by these globalist parasites, how does that
[48:40.840 --> 48:44.560]  make you feel better by running down Kansas when he's probably never been there, you know
[48:44.560 --> 48:52.560]  what Kansas' brand is, happy people, a great housing for low prices, low crime, churches,
[48:52.560 --> 49:02.160]  families, and I like this lady, another gentleman put out this tweet, Todd Edmonds, my Kansas
[49:02.160 --> 49:09.760]  brand view for my three bedroom house on a half acre $980 a month mortgage with a beautiful
[49:09.760 --> 49:17.120]  lake behind them and woods and the moon and stars, there's the Kansas brand, ladies and
[49:17.120 --> 49:23.000]  gentlemen, what's the brand of the New World Order, censorship, control, absolutely disgusting,
[49:23.000 --> 49:28.840]  here's another tweet, anomaly says your new brand in New York is vaccine mandates, high
[49:28.840 --> 49:35.320]  crime, filthy city, Democrat psychosis, yes, New York has been a great city, it's Americana,
[49:35.320 --> 49:42.280]  we love New York, we want to save New York, remember when the mayor said, ha, ha, you
[49:42.280 --> 49:48.900]  know all pay to have these people move to Texas that don't want to be here, well they're
[49:48.900 --> 49:54.040]  already leaving, what does that even mean, it's absolutely insane, so here's the last
[49:54.040 --> 49:59.240]  admitted communist mayor wanting you to take an experimental shot last year and eating
[49:59.240 --> 50:04.880]  a hamburger and fries and you want it, he's so gross, even though I love hamburgers,
[50:04.880 --> 50:10.360]  I may never be able to eat another one, I may not even enjoy a hamburger after watching
[50:10.360 --> 50:13.040]  this disgusting display.
[50:13.040 --> 50:21.720]  Free fries when you get vaccinated, I got vaccinated, you're saying I can get this,
[50:21.720 --> 50:30.680]  the delicious fries, why not, but there's also a burger element to this, let me check
[50:30.680 --> 50:37.920]  if it's too early in the day, this could be breakfast, what a creep, I want you to look
[50:37.920 --> 50:44.640]  at this and think about, again, some people love hamburgers, some don't, I'm not saying
[50:44.640 --> 50:48.880]  he's a pedophile, but if this is appealing to you, just think of this, but if I was going
[50:48.880 --> 50:53.560]  to cast somebody for a movie, there's like a pedophile ringleader that kidnaps little
[50:53.560 --> 51:00.600]  kids and say eats them, it'd be him, I'm getting a very good feeling about vaccination
[51:00.600 --> 51:02.160]  right this moment.
[51:02.160 --> 51:07.720]  Get a free donut too and get microcreditus at the same time, how much fun, these people
[51:07.720 --> 51:15.960]  are sick and evil and out of control, but look at what's happening here, judge orders
[51:15.960 --> 51:24.760]  NYPD union members fired over Vax mandate reinstated with pay, New York Post, NBA style,
[51:24.760 --> 51:29.360]  Kyrie Irving, who I'm told is a big listener, says he lost 100 million four year extensions
[51:29.360 --> 51:33.120]  of refusing COVID vaccine, but he wants to stand in solidarity with people and their
[51:33.120 --> 51:34.640]  bodily autonomy.
[51:34.640 --> 51:39.200]  Just like Djokovic said, talk about people I admire.
[51:39.200 --> 51:50.200]  Meanwhile, Dr. Marty Macory weighs in after mRNA systems found in the milk of breastfeeding
[51:50.200 --> 51:57.960]  mothers that have taken the experimental shot, absolutely horrifying that this is going on
[51:57.960 --> 52:02.160]  at this level, but let's go to this clip.
[52:02.160 --> 52:11.640]  This my friends is MSNBC's Joy Reed comparing Floridians evacuating to illegal immigrants
[52:11.640 --> 52:12.640]  crossing the border.
[52:12.640 --> 52:17.240]  Well, in a way they are, they're fleeing the globalist lockdowns and the UN organizers
[52:17.240 --> 52:18.640]  have become here.
[52:18.640 --> 52:24.640]  That's a destructive evil force and I guess the Floridians are fleeing like people running
[52:24.640 --> 52:25.640]  from a danger.
[52:25.640 --> 52:26.640]  Here it is.
[52:26.640 --> 52:32.800]  And be careful about attacking people who have to move to save their own lives and safety
[52:32.800 --> 52:36.080]  because you never know when it's your people that have to move, when it's your people who
[52:36.080 --> 52:40.120]  have to migrate, when it's your people who have to get on that road.
[52:40.120 --> 52:43.120]  So just a thought.
[52:43.120 --> 52:48.200]  Of course, what she's saying is a giant lie.
[52:48.200 --> 52:54.280]  Oh, if people got across your border organized by the UN, they're the same as somebody in
[52:54.280 --> 52:55.880]  the United States going to a different state.
[52:55.880 --> 52:57.680]  No, that's not the same.
[52:57.680 --> 52:58.960]  But that's how the globalists want it.
[52:58.960 --> 53:03.160]  They want to be able to completely get rid of national sovereignty and control us with
[53:03.160 --> 53:05.880]  permanent underclasses that they bring in.
[53:05.880 --> 53:13.040]  Now, not to be outdone by Joy Reed, Don Lemon, no ratings, Lemon is talking to the head of
[53:13.040 --> 53:18.880]  the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration and is saying, what effects does climate change
[53:18.880 --> 53:20.560]  have on the phenomenon?
[53:20.560 --> 53:24.680]  And he's trying to, in the larger clip to say hurricanes are worse, things are getting
[53:24.680 --> 53:28.320]  worse, we're having more hurricanes, we have the numbers right here, we've had half the
[53:28.320 --> 53:34.520]  hurricanes since the 60s that they recorded previous to that, and the trend's going down,
[53:34.520 --> 53:35.520]  even less hurricanes.
[53:35.520 --> 53:39.120]  But now every time a hurricane comes, they say it's human's fault, it's all our fault
[53:39.120 --> 53:44.360]  because we're bad people, if we just pay Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates and Al Gore carbon
[53:44.360 --> 53:46.960]  tax money, then everything will be okay.
[53:46.960 --> 53:49.000]  So let's go ahead, ladies and gentlemen, and go to that clip.
[53:49.000 --> 53:54.000]  Look here, you can actually see, pretty interesting for your viewers, you can actually see a second
[53:54.000 --> 53:59.680]  eyewall forming around the inner eyewall, and that's basically the second eyewall has
[53:59.680 --> 54:04.000]  overtaken the original eyewall, and that should arrest development.
[54:04.000 --> 54:08.040]  Listen, I'm just trying to get to, you said you want to talk about climate change, but
[54:08.040 --> 54:12.560]  what effect does climate change have on this phenomenon that is happening now, because
[54:12.560 --> 54:15.040]  it seems these storms are intensifying.
[54:15.040 --> 54:16.040]  That's the question.
[54:16.040 --> 54:18.840]  I don't think you can link climate change to any one event.
[54:18.840 --> 54:25.760]  From the whole, on the cumulative, climate change may be making storms worse, but to
[54:25.760 --> 54:29.640]  link it to any one event, I would caution against that.
[54:29.640 --> 54:33.800]  Okay, listen, I grew up there, and these storms are intensifying.
[54:33.800 --> 54:36.240]  Something is causing them to intensify.
[54:36.240 --> 54:38.520]  So this storm is just, it's a massive one.
[54:38.520 --> 54:40.640]  Its effects are also being felt in the sun.
[54:40.640 --> 54:46.160]  So he just told a accredited, respected head meteorologist that, no, you're wrong.
[54:46.160 --> 54:47.160]  They're getting worse.
[54:47.160 --> 54:51.400]  I am Don, Supreme Leader of Earth Lemon.
[54:51.400 --> 54:54.000]  Here's some of the headlines dealing with it.
[54:54.000 --> 54:59.240]  Hurricane Ian strengthens to Powerful Category 4 as Florida Landfall Eminent will be covering
[54:59.240 --> 55:00.680]  that as it unfolds.
[55:00.680 --> 55:04.280]  Hurricane Ian MSNBC Jor-Ree compares Floridians evacuating to illegal immigrants crossing
[55:04.280 --> 55:05.280]  the border.
[55:05.280 --> 55:10.720]  We have the details on the hurricane up on infowars.com.
[55:10.720 --> 55:15.960]  With 155-mile-an-hour winds, Cuba entirely without power right now.
[55:15.960 --> 55:20.720]  After the storm crossed over Cuba, power grid collapsed.
[55:20.720 --> 55:23.720]  It's really hard of living on this planet.
[55:23.720 --> 55:24.720]  This happens.
[55:24.720 --> 55:27.320]  Florida's a beautiful state, but it gets hit by a lot of hurricanes.
[55:27.320 --> 55:29.800]  That's why folks are used to it and prepared for it.
[55:29.800 --> 55:31.440]  We're praying for everybody that's there.
[55:31.440 --> 55:34.640]  It's shut down airports and schools.
[55:34.640 --> 55:37.320]  We'll continue to track that and break that down.
[55:37.320 --> 55:39.160]  In my stack I'll get to next hour.
[55:39.160 --> 55:45.560]  I've got some of the articles from the major meteorological groups that document that hurricanes
[55:45.560 --> 55:49.000]  are actually getting less severe and less common.
[55:49.000 --> 55:50.400]  I don't see that in my stack.
[55:50.400 --> 55:51.400]  I put it somewhere else.
[55:51.400 --> 55:52.400]  But everybody knows that.
[55:52.400 --> 55:53.400]  You can find it for yourself.
[55:53.400 --> 55:54.400]  Do your own research.
[55:54.400 --> 55:58.800]  Remember they said the ice caps were supposed to already be melted, but meanwhile you've
[55:58.800 --> 56:01.440]  got all these globalists buying houses right on the beach.
[56:01.440 --> 56:07.200]  It's a load of BS like you're an ignorant savage that they can say, you were bad, storm
[56:07.200 --> 56:08.200]  come.
[56:08.200 --> 56:10.360]  Now we need human sacrifice.
[56:10.360 --> 56:14.120]  In ancient Europe they've dug up plenty of bodies and all over the world as well that
[56:14.120 --> 56:16.720]  were sacrificed when the crops didn't come in.
[56:16.720 --> 56:18.600]  Oh, the crops didn't do well.
[56:18.600 --> 56:20.560]  They didn't know what fungus was eating the crops.
[56:20.560 --> 56:26.280]  They just said we've got to sacrifice some people so that the nature God gives us a more
[56:26.280 --> 56:28.280]  bountiful harvest.
[56:28.280 --> 56:30.600]  Yeah, this is a great clip.
[56:30.600 --> 56:32.040]  We'll play this when we come back.
[56:32.040 --> 56:39.080]  We're totally destroying what's really going on with the so-called manmade global warming
[56:39.080 --> 56:40.080]  and climate change.
[56:40.080 --> 56:43.200]  So, it's open phones on any topic.
[56:43.200 --> 56:44.200]  It's first-time callers.
[56:44.200 --> 56:45.360]  It's long-time callers.
[56:45.360 --> 56:46.360]  It's callers that agree.
[56:46.360 --> 56:47.520]  It's callers that disagree.
[56:47.520 --> 56:51.320]  It's a free-for-all on all these subjects or anything you want to talk about.
[56:51.320 --> 56:55.320]  They had Joel Scowze and joined us the third hour, an hour of calls.
[56:55.320 --> 56:56.320]  But just be ready.
[56:56.320 --> 56:57.720]  I'm going to go to your call and move the next person.
[56:57.720 --> 57:04.800]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-789-2539-877-789-2539.
[57:04.800 --> 57:08.400]  There it is on screen, 877-789-ALEX.
[57:08.400 --> 57:10.640]  And we will take your phone calls.
[57:10.640 --> 57:13.180]  And again, we're in the middle of a major fundraiser here.
[57:13.180 --> 57:15.400]  We've taken on the Democrats, the Deep State, the New World Order.
[57:15.400 --> 57:16.840]  You see them attacking us everywhere.
[57:16.840 --> 57:22.120]  We need funds to make it through these show trials and then have the appeals so they can't
[57:22.120 --> 57:23.960]  shut us down for years to come.
[57:23.960 --> 57:26.200]  This is the biggest hurdle in our history.
[57:26.200 --> 57:28.280]  So please go to infowarstore.com.
[57:28.280 --> 57:32.320]  We have our biggest sell of the year going right now, up to 50% off, X3's back in stock.

[57:50.280 --> 57:55.120]  Think about a world without info wars.
[57:55.120 --> 57:59.400]  Just take a moment and sit back and think about all the incredible guests and callers
[57:59.400 --> 58:01.620]  and stories we've broken together.
[58:01.620 --> 58:04.720]  This family that is info wars.
[58:04.720 --> 58:09.840]  Think about how info wars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and Ball Sonaro and
[58:09.840 --> 58:17.320]  other foreign leaders like Nigel Farage as being the main impetus towards firing up their
[58:17.320 --> 58:20.840]  main base to defeat the new world order.
[58:20.840 --> 58:26.600]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today is because the viewers and listeners
[58:26.600 --> 58:31.080]  of this broadcast have taken action and supported this show.
[58:31.080 --> 58:32.840]  I don't take the credit.
[58:32.840 --> 58:34.680]  I give you the credit.
[58:34.680 --> 58:37.040]  And now info wars is facing its darkest hours.
[58:37.040 --> 58:39.040]  It isn't going to give up.
[58:39.040 --> 58:40.800]  Without your support, we can be shut down.
[58:40.800 --> 58:49.800]  Please go to saveinfowars.com today, saveinfowars.com today and donate for our legal defense fund.
[58:49.800 --> 58:55.840]  The biggest sale of 2022 is now live exclusively at infowarstore.com.

[59:17.720 --> 59:22.400]  The deep breath crystal iodine and two other types to maximize full absorption.

[59:52.960 --> 1:00:18.280]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, your phone calls are coming up at 877-789-2539 on this
[1:00:18.280 --> 1:00:24.920]  live Wednesday, September 28 broadcast, we have a lot of other economic news, we have
[1:00:24.920 --> 1:00:31.400]  a lot of medical tyranny news, we have a lot of anti-gun news, we have a lot of government
[1:00:31.400 --> 1:00:35.920]  insider trading news, a lot of news, I'm going to be smattering in here in the next hour
[1:00:35.920 --> 1:00:41.720]  taking your phone calls, but I wanted to play this clip of Dan Pina and businessman.
[1:00:41.720 --> 1:00:42.720]  He gets pretty heated.
[1:00:42.720 --> 1:00:46.360]  So we had to bleep it, but just in a very short clip, he knocks it out of the park and
[1:00:46.360 --> 1:00:53.120]  exposes the fraud of so-called manmade climate change and the so-called solutions to it.
[1:00:53.120 --> 1:00:57.520]  Let's just take Florida, for example, which is one of the fastest growing beachfront condominiums
[1:00:57.520 --> 1:00:58.520]  on the planet.
[1:00:58.520 --> 1:01:03.280]  In the prospectus, when you invest, there should be, in the footnotes, if global warming
[1:01:03.280 --> 1:01:09.080]  is for real, they won't put it that way, global warming happens and water rises 10 feet,
[1:01:09.080 --> 1:01:11.360]  this investment you made is all.
[1:01:11.360 --> 1:01:18.360]  Now one single investment prospectus written this century has alluded to global warming.
[1:01:18.360 --> 1:01:24.240]  Now one, if it were really true, the banks wouldn't invest, the banks wouldn't finance.
[1:01:24.240 --> 1:01:32.000]  Now one, because the financial institutions, the banks of this world know it's not going
[1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:33.000]  to happen.
[1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:35.760]  Otherwise, you couldn't get a goddamn loan in London.
[1:01:35.760 --> 1:01:39.360]  You know those 30, 40 year mortgages, the world will be over by then with the greatest
[1:01:39.360 --> 1:01:44.360]  prospect, ma'am, it's the greatest fraud that's been perpetrated on mankind this century.
[1:01:44.360 --> 1:01:49.480]  And it's an excuse and a reason to take over and monitor and track everybody with a global
[1:01:49.480 --> 1:01:52.320]  ID and global digital currency in their own words.
[1:01:52.320 --> 1:01:57.360]  There's Barack Obama's giant mansion, that's just part of it, literally 100 yards from
[1:01:57.360 --> 1:02:02.840]  the Atlantic Ocean and his house is one foot above sea level.
[1:02:02.840 --> 1:02:07.400]  He bought the house six years ago when he left office.
[1:02:07.400 --> 1:02:15.120]  He's everywhere telling you that everything's going to flood and we're all going to be dead.
[1:02:15.120 --> 1:02:18.720]  And everything happening when they release a deadly virus is climate change, hate speech
[1:02:18.720 --> 1:02:19.720]  is climate change.
[1:02:19.720 --> 1:02:21.200]  It's the excuse for everything.
[1:02:21.200 --> 1:02:24.640]  All right, let's start taking some phone calls right now.
[1:02:24.640 --> 1:02:27.400]  Let's just start getting doing those for a short segment.
[1:02:27.400 --> 1:02:29.680]  Let's talk to Robert in Thailand.
[1:02:29.680 --> 1:02:30.680]  Robert, thanks for calling.
[1:02:30.680 --> 1:02:31.680]  You're on the air.
[1:02:31.680 --> 1:02:37.320]  Well, I have two quick points I'm going to touch on then I'll get out of here, Alex.
[1:02:37.320 --> 1:02:41.400]  First, I wanted to just mention to people that when you debate with left-wing people
[1:02:41.400 --> 1:02:47.680]  online, make sure you mentioned the custody of power that Biden is a puppet of George
[1:02:47.680 --> 1:02:51.320]  Bush and the Bush crime family through Obama.
[1:02:51.320 --> 1:02:54.960]  That's something that people can mention in their debates.
[1:02:54.960 --> 1:02:58.400]  Second, Alex has been over 10 years, I've talked to you.
[1:02:58.400 --> 1:03:03.240]  You did a couple of segments on my YouTube channel, Funkmaster 5.
[1:03:03.240 --> 1:03:09.840]  And as a result of that, you actually created another syndicate, super admin, but I've been
[1:03:09.840 --> 1:03:10.840]  fighting the drug war.
[1:03:10.840 --> 1:03:14.920]  I've been exposing them lying about cannabis, curing cancer and other stuff.
[1:03:14.920 --> 1:03:20.320]  So I'd like to connect and show you guys some of the stuff we've been working on coming
[1:03:20.320 --> 1:03:21.320]  out of retirement.
[1:03:21.320 --> 1:03:26.680]  Well, I wasn't in retirement because I was fighting another front in the Info War.
[1:03:26.680 --> 1:03:28.840]  And there's a lot of hidden truth there too.
[1:03:28.840 --> 1:03:32.640]  They've lied about cannabis killing COVID too.
[1:03:32.640 --> 1:03:35.560]  So I figured these could be interesting topics.
[1:03:35.560 --> 1:03:38.960]  If you want to shove me off to somebody, I could also talk to one of your guys in the
[1:03:38.960 --> 1:03:42.280]  background and catch up with you guys later so you can get the other calls.
[1:03:42.280 --> 1:03:46.080]  Funkmaster 5, I remember you years ago being on the show.
[1:03:46.080 --> 1:03:47.720]  I remember that.
[1:03:47.720 --> 1:03:49.000]  Just send Rob do an email.
[1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:51.200]  I think you know his email here at Info Wars.
[1:03:51.200 --> 1:03:56.120]  Well, he's a consultant now, but he can still check those emails from time to time.
[1:03:56.120 --> 1:03:59.120]  And so I know that was your contact back then, wasn't it?
[1:03:59.120 --> 1:04:02.840]  Actually, you know what, I met you briefly at Occupy Builderburg.
[1:04:02.840 --> 1:04:08.400]  I made the Occupy Builderburg page about a month before you brought everybody in and
[1:04:08.400 --> 1:04:09.400]  lit it up.
[1:04:09.400 --> 1:04:16.120]  I created the name and then you actually lit it up like a rocket basically and made it
[1:04:16.120 --> 1:04:17.120]  into the big...
[1:04:17.120 --> 1:04:19.240]  Well, it's our audience that did that.
[1:04:19.240 --> 1:04:20.240]  They get all the credit.
[1:04:20.240 --> 1:04:21.240]  Thank you, Robert.
[1:04:21.240 --> 1:04:22.240]  Appreciate your call.
[1:04:22.240 --> 1:04:25.480]  Yeah, if you go back 10, 15 years ago, they said Builderburg Group didn't exist.
[1:04:25.480 --> 1:04:29.640]  Now they admit it exists in one's world government and it's spokesperson and its PR group is
[1:04:29.640 --> 1:04:33.400]  the World Economic Forum that has taken over half the governments in the world in their
[1:04:33.400 --> 1:04:34.800]  own words.
[1:04:34.800 --> 1:04:39.200]  But now we, the information and truth are taking governments back around the world
[1:04:39.200 --> 1:04:40.360]  right now.
[1:04:40.360 --> 1:04:45.400]  That's why they've got all these W.E.F. spokespersons like the leader of New Zealand saying, the
[1:04:45.400 --> 1:04:48.320]  main mission is to silence the people of the world.
[1:04:48.320 --> 1:04:49.920]  Their words are weapons.
[1:04:49.920 --> 1:04:53.040]  No lady, you work for the weapons system, the new world order.
[1:04:53.040 --> 1:05:00.040]  Back in 60 seconds, more calls straight ahead.
[1:05:00.040 --> 1:05:01.920]  Look around you.
[1:05:01.920 --> 1:05:05.640]  Everything I predicted from the Globalistone documents from their own admissions is now
[1:05:05.640 --> 1:05:06.640]  happening.
[1:05:06.640 --> 1:05:08.280]  Info wars credibility.
[1:05:08.280 --> 1:05:12.720]  My credibility has never been higher and it's because of your backing of this operation
[1:05:12.720 --> 1:05:18.600]  that I could steadfastly, despite the censorship and the boycotts and the attacks and the lawsuits
[1:05:18.600 --> 1:05:19.600]  stay on air.
[1:05:19.600 --> 1:05:24.760]  But now we're reaching the most critical juncture in the fight together.
[1:05:24.760 --> 1:05:29.880]  So I want to ask all of you today to help keep me on the air.
[1:05:29.880 --> 1:05:33.800]  In my decades on air, I've never asked for personal donations, but I'm being forced by
[1:05:33.800 --> 1:05:39.320]  the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees and I can't fund those myself.
[1:05:39.320 --> 1:05:40.320]  It's unsustainable.
[1:05:40.320 --> 1:05:45.040]  So please visit saveinfowars.com.
[1:05:45.040 --> 1:05:52.040]  Where you can make straight donations, $5, $10, $500, whatever you can so that I can continue
[1:05:52.040 --> 1:05:53.040]  to persevere.
[1:05:53.040 --> 1:05:54.040]  I'll never give up.
[1:05:54.040 --> 1:05:55.040]  I'll never give in.
[1:05:55.040 --> 1:05:56.040]  But I could give out.
[1:05:56.040 --> 1:06:17.840]  Thank you for your support, Woodmere Without You, saveinfowars.com.
[1:06:17.840 --> 1:06:23.960]  Well, Hurricane Ian is a bad one, starting to make landfall as a category 450 mile an
[1:06:23.960 --> 1:06:30.120]  hour winds pray for folks there in Florida that all over the corporate media are saying,
[1:06:30.120 --> 1:06:31.480]  see it's your fault.
[1:06:31.480 --> 1:06:33.040]  It's manmade global warming.
[1:06:33.040 --> 1:06:35.400]  Same reason we got COVID-19 manmade global warming.
[1:06:35.400 --> 1:06:37.000]  No, you made it to lab.
[1:06:37.000 --> 1:06:40.360]  And this is the worst hurricane season ever and the storms are getting stronger and we're
[1:06:40.360 --> 1:06:41.360]  all dead.
[1:06:41.360 --> 1:06:44.840]  I'm not going to spend an hour on this because I want to go to your phone calls.
[1:06:44.840 --> 1:06:49.360]  But here's the Economist magazine published by the Rothschild family.
[1:06:49.360 --> 1:06:58.080]  The establishment with a detailed report hurricanes in America have become less frequent.
[1:06:58.080 --> 1:07:00.300]  Isn't that interesting?
[1:07:00.300 --> 1:07:09.200]  And it goes into the numbers that they are up to 70% less hurricanes than there used
[1:07:09.200 --> 1:07:10.200]  to be.
[1:07:10.200 --> 1:07:15.640]  Here's a Forbes article a few years ago.
[1:07:15.640 --> 1:07:20.080]  No hurricanes are not bigger, stronger and more dangerous.
[1:07:20.080 --> 1:07:22.560]  In fact, they're less.
[1:07:22.560 --> 1:07:25.040]  Fact check.
[1:07:25.040 --> 1:07:29.080]  Pence says there are no more hurricanes now more than 100 years ago and you go into it
[1:07:29.080 --> 1:07:31.560]  and yes, they're actually less.
[1:07:31.560 --> 1:07:35.440]  Remember they keep telling you that, oh, Glacier Park will soon be unfrozen.
[1:07:35.440 --> 1:07:36.440]  It's not.
[1:07:36.440 --> 1:07:40.120]  Oh, all the ice caps are going to melt by 2013, 2017.
[1:07:40.120 --> 1:07:41.880]  The sea levels are going to rise.
[1:07:41.880 --> 1:07:43.760]  They didn't.
[1:07:43.760 --> 1:07:46.680]  Here's another one out of climate.gov.
[1:07:46.680 --> 1:07:52.680]  Why did Earth's surface temperatures stop rising in the past decade?
[1:07:52.680 --> 1:07:56.440]  I would have Lord Moncton on a decade ago saying that the Earth's temperature has gone
[1:07:56.440 --> 1:08:01.040]  down and they would say, oh, that's alive, but now it's completely admitted.
[1:08:01.040 --> 1:08:03.560]  Did it get hotter in the 80s and 90s?
[1:08:03.560 --> 1:08:04.560]  Absolutely.
[1:08:04.560 --> 1:08:05.800]  Wasn't the hottest ever recorded?
[1:08:05.800 --> 1:08:09.640]  No, they've got ice core samples and mud samples going back just a few thousand years
[1:08:09.640 --> 1:08:10.640]  ago when it was hotter.
[1:08:10.640 --> 1:08:12.000]  It goes through cycles, folks.
[1:08:12.000 --> 1:08:19.640]  You go back 12,000 years ago, there were glaciers as far south as Oklahoma.
[1:08:19.640 --> 1:08:20.640]  They're not there anymore.
[1:08:20.640 --> 1:08:25.160]  So if you're driving around in Oklahoma or Indiana or Illinois, you'll see a big, flat
[1:08:25.160 --> 1:08:31.000]  field in a big old boulder right in the middle of it that's round.
[1:08:31.000 --> 1:08:35.240]  That's because it was under a glacier being rolled by the glacier slowly and being polished
[1:08:35.240 --> 1:08:40.040]  by that glacier.
[1:08:40.040 --> 1:08:44.280]  This will tell you that is a glacial field, a glacial stone.
[1:08:44.280 --> 1:08:48.880]  Remember, they said in the 70s that we'd be in an ice age by the 90s.
[1:08:48.880 --> 1:08:50.880]  They don't know what they're doing.
[1:08:50.880 --> 1:08:53.200]  They don't know what they're saying.
[1:08:53.200 --> 1:08:56.760]  MSN and NBC and others spin it.
[1:08:56.760 --> 1:09:00.000]  They go, well, it's the call before the storm.
[1:09:00.000 --> 1:09:02.680]  Here's an article from this year.
[1:09:02.680 --> 1:09:04.720]  Yeah, storms are way down.
[1:09:04.720 --> 1:09:07.040]  Yeah, they're not as intense.
[1:09:07.040 --> 1:09:09.000]  But that doesn't matter.
[1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:12.600]  That means really bad stuff's coming.
[1:09:12.600 --> 1:09:14.440]  It's all based on the sun.
[1:09:14.440 --> 1:09:16.440]  The sun is the main driver of climate.
[1:09:16.440 --> 1:09:19.080]  It's a big article at CEI.org.
[1:09:19.080 --> 1:09:26.680]  Everybody should read, wrong again, 50 years of failed eco-pocalyptic predictions.
[1:09:26.680 --> 1:09:31.560]  But now, we're told we have to give up our electric cars, give up our gas engines, give
[1:09:31.560 --> 1:09:37.340]  up natural gas, give up coal power, give it all up.
[1:09:37.340 --> 1:09:43.040]  Give it all up, give it all up right now.
[1:09:43.040 --> 1:09:44.040]  Because we're bad.
[1:09:44.040 --> 1:09:48.840]  No, the globalists want us to think we're bad, so we'll follow up their criminal orders.
[1:09:48.840 --> 1:09:51.240]  Stephen Florida, you're on the air.
[1:09:51.240 --> 1:09:52.240]  Welcome.
[1:09:52.240 --> 1:09:57.120]  Alice Gubbless, your brother, was calling in about the Nord Stream Pipeline.
[1:09:57.120 --> 1:10:01.480]  But when you're talking about the climate change, I find it interesting that all of
[1:10:01.480 --> 1:10:07.120]  these hack jobs that are on television or these world economic forum members like Jacinda
[1:10:07.120 --> 1:10:13.040]  Arden, Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates, these guys aren't scientists, but yet they're asserting
[1:10:13.040 --> 1:10:16.960]  that climate change is real and you have to believe it because they say it's real.
[1:10:16.960 --> 1:10:20.200]  And everything they said about the so-called shots was a lie, because they knew it was
[1:10:20.200 --> 1:10:21.200]  a lie.
[1:10:21.200 --> 1:10:22.200]  Everything.
[1:10:22.200 --> 1:10:25.280]  Everything they said was a lie, and they tried to force it on us, and they did on many.
[1:10:25.280 --> 1:10:27.440]  These are damn arch criminals.
[1:10:27.440 --> 1:10:32.040]  A thousand percent true, and they need to be held to account.
[1:10:32.040 --> 1:10:36.680]  There's thousands of scientists out there that are respected, Nobel laureate prize winners
[1:10:36.680 --> 1:10:38.960]  that are saying there is no climate crisis.
[1:10:38.960 --> 1:10:42.920]  We only contribute 3% to the CO2 emissions that they're claiming.
[1:10:42.920 --> 1:10:45.920]  And the CO2 is the trace gas.
[1:10:45.920 --> 1:10:46.920]  Yep.
[1:10:46.920 --> 1:10:51.280]  And like you always say, we are carbon-based life forms.
[1:10:51.280 --> 1:10:55.520]  So with that being said, you look at the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline and all the methane that's
[1:10:55.520 --> 1:11:01.440]  coming out of the ocean now, they've got to be rolling over, they've got to be having
[1:11:01.440 --> 1:11:02.920]  blood sugar out of their eyeballs right now.
[1:11:02.920 --> 1:11:06.920]  Well, that's right, because there's more methane coming out of there than all the cows' rear-earns
[1:11:06.920 --> 1:11:08.480]  on the planet.
[1:11:08.480 --> 1:11:09.480]  That's right.
[1:11:09.480 --> 1:11:10.480]  And this is the thing.
[1:11:10.480 --> 1:11:14.240]  This is my, this is what my speculation is, Alex.
[1:11:14.240 --> 1:11:20.160]  I think this is going to lead to a declaration of war, which is going to create emergency
[1:11:20.160 --> 1:11:21.160]  powers.
[1:11:21.160 --> 1:11:23.560]  Notice all this is happening before the mid-term elections.
[1:11:23.560 --> 1:11:24.560]  Absolutely.
[1:11:24.560 --> 1:11:27.960]  And there's going to be, like you mentioned, the CBBCs, there's probably going to be a
[1:11:27.960 --> 1:11:31.760]  new pandemic thrown in the mix, GMO mosquitoes that are being released.
[1:11:31.760 --> 1:11:37.240]  This is going to be probably one of the worst events ever in our lifetime.
[1:11:37.240 --> 1:11:38.240]  I agree.
[1:11:38.240 --> 1:11:45.120]  And I mean, you notice a month ago, thousands of major concerts, hundreds of huge ones,
[1:11:45.120 --> 1:11:52.080]  rock concerts, country concerts, hip-hop concerts, classical concerts, they're all being canceled.
[1:11:52.080 --> 1:11:53.280]  They're all being canceled.
[1:11:53.280 --> 1:11:57.480]  What do they know is coming with 41 days to the mid-terms?
[1:11:57.480 --> 1:11:59.560]  Well, they know.
[1:11:59.560 --> 1:12:04.880]  They know something's coming, and I think for the most part, they're probably, like,
[1:12:04.880 --> 1:12:07.760]  they're heading to their bunkers, they're getting prepared, they're getting their final
[1:12:07.760 --> 1:12:08.760]  inventories lined up.
[1:12:08.760 --> 1:12:10.800]  And by the way, you're not just saying that for new listeners.
[1:12:10.800 --> 1:12:16.480]  It was CNN headline last week, elites moving to their bunkers to escape reality.
[1:12:16.480 --> 1:12:21.080]  They even admitted, what do you think the event's going to be?
[1:12:21.080 --> 1:12:25.960]  Expanded war, economic collapse, cyber attacks, what do you think it's going to be?
[1:12:25.960 --> 1:12:26.960]  This is what I speculate.
[1:12:26.960 --> 1:12:29.200]  I'm an analyst by trade.
[1:12:29.200 --> 1:12:32.480]  I think what's going to happen, declaration of war, there's no way Russia is just going
[1:12:32.480 --> 1:12:37.640]  to let this pass, regardless of who did this.
[1:12:37.640 --> 1:12:42.040]  I mean, it's interesting the USS Kyrsic was in the area and turned off the transponder
[1:12:42.040 --> 1:12:43.960]  prior to this happening.
[1:12:43.960 --> 1:12:52.680]  But what I think is going to have a declaration of war as a result of that, I think the illegitimate
[1:12:52.680 --> 1:12:55.440]  by the administration is going to invoke emergency powers.
[1:12:55.440 --> 1:12:57.320]  They're going to issue out CBDC.
[1:12:57.320 --> 1:13:02.880]  Now you have a stock market collapse and you think fuel prices are bad now, give it a couple
[1:13:02.880 --> 1:13:05.600]  of weeks and see what happens to the gas prices.
[1:13:05.600 --> 1:13:10.480]  And for folks that don't know what those CBCDs are, explain these are central bank issued
[1:13:10.480 --> 1:13:12.280]  programmable digital currencies.
[1:13:12.280 --> 1:13:17.360]  Yeah, these are digital currencies that on a granular level, I couldn't give my nephew
[1:13:17.360 --> 1:13:23.880]  10 bucks and say here, thanks for mowing the lawn, that's not going to happen anymore.
[1:13:23.880 --> 1:13:28.560]  They will be able to control how, when, and where you can even spend your money if you're
[1:13:28.560 --> 1:13:32.680]  allowed to spend it, and if you even have any to spend.
[1:13:32.680 --> 1:13:33.920]  That's how granular it is.
[1:13:33.920 --> 1:13:38.520]  It's all a matter of how long the money is going to work, how long it's going to... I
[1:13:38.520 --> 1:13:39.840]  mean, they're admitting all this.
[1:13:39.840 --> 1:13:41.520]  This is not us saying this.
[1:13:41.520 --> 1:13:42.520]  Correct.
[1:13:42.520 --> 1:13:43.520]  A thousand percent.
[1:13:43.520 --> 1:13:48.120]  You could look at his executive orders that he put into place and just read them.
[1:13:48.120 --> 1:13:52.680]  Just like you said, read the documents, people have to do their own research and not just
[1:13:52.680 --> 1:13:58.000]  take what I say or you say at face value, just read the documents.
[1:13:58.000 --> 1:14:03.120]  But all these things are going to happen pretty quickly.
[1:14:03.120 --> 1:14:07.720]  The gas prices shooting up, which is going to create a massive stock market crash, higher
[1:14:07.720 --> 1:14:15.880]  fuel prices, housing market crash, it's going to roll up quickly, Alex, and I thank you
[1:14:15.880 --> 1:14:19.840]  for everything that you do, and I know you're tired of hearing the people saying thank you,
[1:14:19.840 --> 1:14:21.520]  but you are the tip of the spear.
[1:14:21.520 --> 1:14:23.800]  You're the one out there on the platform.
[1:14:23.800 --> 1:14:25.840]  You're the one out there shouting to the heavens.
[1:14:25.840 --> 1:14:27.640]  Well, I appreciate you, brother, and God bless you.
[1:14:27.640 --> 1:14:30.040]  I mean, I'll tell you what I really hate doing.
[1:14:30.040 --> 1:14:33.600]  I hate getting up here begging for money every day and the lies that I've got hundreds of
[1:14:33.600 --> 1:14:38.240]  millions of dollars when I don't have $2 million in cash, and I want to keep this crew employed
[1:14:38.240 --> 1:14:42.000]  and I want to be strong through this crisis, and we have been under such attack.
[1:14:42.000 --> 1:14:43.000]  I'm not a victim.
[1:14:43.000 --> 1:14:44.000]  I asked for it.
[1:14:44.000 --> 1:14:45.000]  I'm just letting listeners know.
[1:14:45.000 --> 1:14:46.160]  Thanks for your support.
[1:14:46.160 --> 1:14:47.160]  I'm supporting you.
[1:14:47.160 --> 1:14:48.160]  You're supporting me.
[1:14:48.160 --> 1:14:52.840]  But we need folks to go to infowarstore.com and get great products you already need that
[1:14:52.840 --> 1:14:55.000]  are effective pack for your immune system.
[1:14:55.000 --> 1:14:58.360]  We need people to go to 1776coin.com and get the fundraiser coin.
[1:14:58.360 --> 1:15:01.080]  We need folks to get a signed copy of the book if you can afford it or get the unsigned.
[1:15:01.080 --> 1:15:02.600]  If you don't, I'm not bitching.
[1:15:02.600 --> 1:15:03.960]  I'm not complaining.
[1:15:03.960 --> 1:15:09.280]  I just get so frustrated with knowing we can stop the new world order and knowing info
[1:15:09.280 --> 1:15:13.080]  wars is having its biggest effect ever and the fact that we're treading water.
[1:15:13.080 --> 1:15:15.200]  So I'm not complaining.
[1:15:15.200 --> 1:15:17.920]  I'm just simply asking folks, go to infowarstore.com.
[1:15:17.920 --> 1:15:20.440]  Go to 1776coin.com.
[1:15:20.440 --> 1:15:26.320]  If you want to support me, because the bankruptcy court said, hey, you should pay 40% of the
[1:15:26.320 --> 1:15:27.320]  legal bills.
[1:15:27.320 --> 1:15:31.400]  Well, I mean, we're in a bankruptcy and we got a trial going and one more trial.
[1:15:31.400 --> 1:15:35.840]  I don't have enough money in the bank to pay for that, okay, personally.
[1:15:35.840 --> 1:15:38.400]  So we got to make it over this hump.
[1:15:38.400 --> 1:15:39.760]  The appeals process will take years.
[1:15:39.760 --> 1:15:42.680]  It's not that expensive and we will be in a lot better position.
[1:15:42.680 --> 1:15:44.600]  But by then we're going to be in a total depression.
[1:15:44.600 --> 1:15:46.400]  So I'm just being honest with everybody.
[1:15:46.400 --> 1:15:49.640]  Take care of yourselves, but I think info wars is something people should take care of that
[1:15:49.640 --> 1:15:50.640]  is essential.
[1:15:50.640 --> 1:15:51.840]  So thanks for your support.
[1:15:51.840 --> 1:15:54.040]  Save info wars.com.
[1:15:54.040 --> 1:15:58.840]  Save info wars.com.
[1:15:58.840 --> 1:16:03.640]  Think about a world without info wars.
[1:16:03.640 --> 1:16:08.080]  Just take a moment and sit back and think about all the incredible guests and callers and
[1:16:08.080 --> 1:16:10.160]  stories we've broken together.
[1:16:10.160 --> 1:16:13.280]  This family that is info wars.
[1:16:13.280 --> 1:16:18.400]  Think about how info wars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and Bolsonaro and
[1:16:18.400 --> 1:16:25.880]  other foreign leaders like Nigel Farage as being the main impetus towards firing up their
[1:16:25.880 --> 1:16:29.360]  main base to defeat the new world order.
[1:16:29.360 --> 1:16:35.120]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today is because the viewers and listeners
[1:16:35.120 --> 1:16:39.600]  of this broadcast have taken action and supported the show.
[1:16:39.600 --> 1:16:41.360]  I don't take the credit.
[1:16:41.360 --> 1:16:45.640]  I give you the credit and now info wars is facing its darkest hours.
[1:16:45.640 --> 1:16:48.080]  It isn't going to give up without your support.
[1:16:48.080 --> 1:16:49.320]  We can be shut down.

[1:20:24.240 --> 1:20:25.240]  callers.
[1:20:25.240 --> 1:20:29.080]  Dean wants to talk about something that I mentioned in the last few days, but I should
[1:20:29.080 --> 1:20:30.520]  have covered more.
[1:20:30.520 --> 1:20:36.440]  All sorts of mass shootings in Russia, men in black uniforms showing up at recruiting
[1:20:36.440 --> 1:20:41.560]  offices, at conscription offices for their national drafts, shooting people, shooting
[1:20:41.560 --> 1:20:47.200]  the officers, going into schools, killing 17 people, injuring dozens of others.
[1:20:47.200 --> 1:20:54.760]  Black outfits, I mean, the Ukrainians are blowing up journalists inside Russia.
[1:20:54.760 --> 1:20:58.600]  Now the Nord Stream 2 has been blown up, they're saying they've sabotaged the Nord Stream 1
[1:20:58.600 --> 1:21:00.600]  a week ago.
[1:21:00.600 --> 1:21:01.840]  I mean, this is crazy.
[1:21:01.840 --> 1:21:08.160]  This is war provocation, like the last caller said, and Dean wanted to talk about it.
[1:21:08.160 --> 1:21:09.640]  Go ahead, Dean, give us your tag.
[1:21:09.640 --> 1:21:10.640]  Yeah, hi.
[1:21:10.640 --> 1:21:16.600]  Before anything, I wanted to say, if I was a whale, I would buy all your products and
[1:21:16.600 --> 1:21:21.440]  then donate them back so you can make double the profit, and I hope a whale out there here
[1:21:21.440 --> 1:21:22.440]  is being does it.
[1:21:22.440 --> 1:21:23.440]  Thank you, brother.
[1:21:23.440 --> 1:21:24.440]  I've done it at an auction.
[1:21:24.440 --> 1:21:29.040]  Yeah, I've done it at an auction before, a cherry auction and bought the item and then
[1:21:29.040 --> 1:21:30.040]  said re-option it.
[1:21:30.040 --> 1:21:33.440]  Oh, hey, hey, hey, listen, I'm just so busy, I got to get around to it.
[1:21:33.440 --> 1:21:35.760]  We're going to go ahead, even though we love it, we're going to auction off the armored
[1:21:35.760 --> 1:21:39.520]  vehicle, even though it's a great PR thing and lets us go into antivarias and it's famous.
[1:21:39.520 --> 1:21:40.520]  We're going to auction that.
[1:21:40.520 --> 1:21:43.680]  I'm going to auction my Hellcat, even though they're not going to make them anymore.
[1:21:43.680 --> 1:21:48.240]  I'm getting ready to, I got two extra watches that people gave me.
[1:21:48.240 --> 1:21:49.440]  I'm going to auction those.
[1:21:49.440 --> 1:21:52.320]  I'm going to put everything into InfoWars.
[1:21:52.320 --> 1:21:53.320]  Everything into this operation.
[1:21:53.320 --> 1:21:54.320]  We're not going anywhere.
[1:21:54.320 --> 1:21:55.320]  I know God's going to come through.
[1:21:55.320 --> 1:21:56.320]  I know you're going to come through.
[1:21:56.320 --> 1:21:58.280]  But brother, what's your view on this?
[1:21:58.280 --> 1:22:05.800]  Well, I wanted to bring up how Russia, they ran into Ukraine because of neo-Nazis, right?
[1:22:05.800 --> 1:22:11.160]  So now all of a sudden, some guy goes into the school, shoots up the school and he's
[1:22:11.160 --> 1:22:13.720]  got swastikas on his chest and all that.
[1:22:13.720 --> 1:22:19.040]  Now, comparison to what you were trying to express regarding Sandy Hook, false flags and
[1:22:19.040 --> 1:22:20.960]  how governments do that.
[1:22:20.960 --> 1:22:25.400]  I know you apologize to the family and all that, but the family doesn't know that governments
[1:22:25.400 --> 1:22:31.880]  do false flags like that and what if Russia is doing the exact same thing, trying to villainize
[1:22:31.880 --> 1:22:36.560]  Ukraine saying there's neo-Nazis there and look, they're even coming into our schools
[1:22:36.560 --> 1:22:37.960]  and shooting up our schools.
[1:22:37.960 --> 1:22:45.520]  I actually have the Derspiegel article where the CIA told the German government that they
[1:22:45.520 --> 1:22:47.320]  believe Ukraine would blow up the pipeline.
[1:22:47.320 --> 1:22:49.200]  I think they were planning that.
[1:22:49.200 --> 1:22:53.080]  So I don't think Ukraine has capability with a submarine to go down there and do that.
[1:22:53.080 --> 1:22:57.480]  The U.S. did drills weeks before in that exact area with Navy SEALs and submarines.
[1:22:57.480 --> 1:22:58.480]  So give me a break.
[1:22:58.480 --> 1:23:01.240]  I know the guys that actually carry those missions out, they haven't told me anything,
[1:23:01.240 --> 1:23:05.240]  but I know the people in SEAL Team 10 that do that stuff.
[1:23:05.240 --> 1:23:06.240]  That's underwater demolition.
[1:23:06.240 --> 1:23:13.840]  Put a bunch of tanks down there and release the air and all air blows up, you know what
[1:23:13.840 --> 1:23:14.840]  I'm saying?
[1:23:14.840 --> 1:23:18.840]  I understand the CIA said Russia could do a false flag.
[1:23:18.840 --> 1:23:22.360]  I'm not saying it's a false flag, but I actually have the article right here where they say
[1:23:22.360 --> 1:23:23.360]  that.
[1:23:23.360 --> 1:23:24.760]  In fact, I'll cover that article here in just a moment.
[1:23:24.760 --> 1:23:25.760]  Anything else, sir?
[1:23:25.760 --> 1:23:31.000]  I know I watched a lot of Mission Impossible movies when I was a kid, but that stuff happens.
[1:23:31.000 --> 1:23:32.680]  They do fake stuff, you know?
[1:23:32.680 --> 1:23:33.680]  They do it.
[1:23:33.680 --> 1:23:34.680]  Absolutely.
[1:23:34.680 --> 1:23:35.680]  I appreciate your call.
[1:23:35.680 --> 1:23:38.960]  I don't want to talk about Sandy Hooker today, but since you raise it, let me just hit this
[1:23:38.960 --> 1:23:48.320]  briefly and then I'll go back to your calls because this is just out of control.
[1:23:48.320 --> 1:23:53.280]  Scarlett Lewis came and shook my hand and told me she gave me everything, and I told
[1:23:53.280 --> 1:23:56.320]  her I wanted to promote her charity that teaches kids peace and love.
[1:23:56.320 --> 1:23:58.520]  It's not an anti-gun group.
[1:23:58.520 --> 1:24:01.920]  She went on CNN and said, I'm the biggest bully in the world, a terrible person again.
[1:24:01.920 --> 1:24:07.040]  I mean, it's what I've seen is the more I apologize, even for stuff I really didn't do, most of
[1:24:07.040 --> 1:24:11.600]  it, the more nasty these folks get, and that's why I said last week, I don't apologize to
[1:24:11.600 --> 1:24:12.600]  you.
[1:24:12.600 --> 1:24:13.600]  I didn't say the things you said.
[1:24:13.600 --> 1:24:14.600]  I'm not allowed to defend myself.
[1:24:14.600 --> 1:24:18.800]  I'm giving this whole list of things I can't say in court, and I said, I'm done.
[1:24:18.800 --> 1:24:19.800]  I didn't do the things you said.
[1:24:19.800 --> 1:24:23.640]  I didn't say to people in your houses, 99% of what you say is true.
[1:24:23.640 --> 1:24:27.600]  That's why they don't have anything to show the jury because there's nothing there.
[1:24:27.600 --> 1:24:33.320]  Well, here's the headline, Alex Jones' Trial, Families Testified on Confrontation with Sandy
[1:24:33.320 --> 1:24:37.480]  Hook Deniers and How Someone Sent Them in an Email, Pictures of Dead Children.
[1:24:37.480 --> 1:24:39.520]  What the hell does that have to do with me?
[1:24:39.520 --> 1:24:42.320]  Well, the judge has instructed the jury, I created all this.
[1:24:42.320 --> 1:24:43.320]  No.
[1:24:43.320 --> 1:24:48.760]  It's viral videos, people questioning, because we don't believe anything we're told anymore.
[1:24:48.760 --> 1:24:53.600]  It's absolutely, completely dangerous.
[1:24:53.600 --> 1:24:57.760]  Here it is, Alex Jones' Trial, Sandy Hook mother tells jury she was sent pictures of
[1:24:57.760 --> 1:25:00.360]  dead kids by hoax believers.
[1:25:00.360 --> 1:25:05.160]  And my lawyer asked, did Alex Jones send that to you?
[1:25:05.160 --> 1:25:08.240]  Those people say Alex Jones sent them?
[1:25:08.240 --> 1:25:09.240]  No.
[1:25:09.240 --> 1:25:16.320]  Here's another headline, Judge in Alex Jones' Sandy Hook Trial denies plaintiff's motion
[1:25:16.320 --> 1:25:20.280]  for a gag order to, quote, protect against mistrial, because she can't legally do that
[1:25:20.280 --> 1:25:21.280]  under the precedents.
[1:25:21.280 --> 1:25:25.040]  But she's already gagged what I can say in the courtroom.
[1:25:25.040 --> 1:25:28.360]  They'll never win this on appeal if there's any freedom left in this country.
[1:25:28.360 --> 1:25:32.280]  We have to make it through the show trials, then have the appeals, and then they still
[1:25:32.280 --> 1:25:33.960]  can't shut us down for years.
[1:25:33.960 --> 1:25:39.000]  If they get those big judgments on appeal, then they're not getting any money.
[1:25:39.000 --> 1:25:42.480]  They may be able to shut down this incarnation, but they can't silence me.
[1:25:42.480 --> 1:25:45.960]  But long before we ever get to that, we're either going to back the globalist off or
[1:25:45.960 --> 1:25:47.560]  everybody's screwed.
[1:25:47.560 --> 1:25:48.560]  Just understand that.
[1:25:48.560 --> 1:25:49.800]  People say, how are you taking it?
[1:25:49.800 --> 1:25:51.320]  Why are you not more stressed out?
[1:25:51.320 --> 1:25:53.000]  Why are you not worried?
[1:25:53.000 --> 1:25:57.280]  My wife, my security guys when I was up there, we had people try to jump out of cars, attack
[1:25:57.280 --> 1:25:58.520]  us, all sorts of stuff.
[1:25:58.520 --> 1:26:00.600]  They're like, why are you so calm?
[1:26:00.600 --> 1:26:02.560]  And I said, we're about to have major war with Russia.
[1:26:02.560 --> 1:26:04.280]  We already are having it.
[1:26:04.280 --> 1:26:06.680]  The economy is imploding around us.
[1:26:06.680 --> 1:26:07.680]  The borders are open.
[1:26:07.680 --> 1:26:08.680]  They're shipping and fentanyl.
[1:26:08.680 --> 1:26:12.560]  Everyone I know has family members that died from fentanyl.
[1:26:12.560 --> 1:26:15.160]  It's hundreds of thousands a year.
[1:26:15.160 --> 1:26:18.160]  They're going to release a new deadly virus.
[1:26:18.160 --> 1:26:22.240]  So my job is to stay on air as long as God keeps me here.
[1:26:22.240 --> 1:26:23.880]  And I'm not worried about Alex Jones.
[1:26:23.880 --> 1:26:25.440]  So I'm not worried about their lives.
[1:26:25.440 --> 1:26:29.840]  I'm not worried about their attacks for me personally, but I need to stay on air.
[1:26:29.840 --> 1:26:32.320]  That's a critical mission.
[1:26:32.320 --> 1:26:36.120]  All I'm worried about is you, the audience being active and involved and informed and
[1:26:36.120 --> 1:26:37.120]  supporting.
[1:26:37.120 --> 1:26:38.120]  That's what matters.
[1:26:38.120 --> 1:26:41.480]  And I cannot tell you, and again, it's not bragging.
[1:26:41.480 --> 1:26:44.920]  The enemy knows this, and it's why I'm under such a tat.
[1:26:44.920 --> 1:26:48.080]  We are the main influencing operation now, countering the globalist narrative across
[1:26:48.080 --> 1:26:49.080]  the board.
[1:26:49.080 --> 1:26:50.080]  Info wars.
[1:26:50.080 --> 1:26:55.040]  If we were a bowling league, if we were a bowling team, we hit nothing but strikes, folks.
[1:26:55.040 --> 1:26:58.680]  We are kicking their lives up and down the street.
[1:26:58.680 --> 1:27:00.720]  And that's all thanks to your support, and I salute you.
[1:27:00.720 --> 1:27:02.240]  Let's keep doing it.
[1:27:02.240 --> 1:27:04.960]  Nicholas in New York, you're on the air.
[1:27:04.960 --> 1:27:05.960]  Welcome.
[1:27:05.960 --> 1:27:06.960]  Hello?
[1:27:06.960 --> 1:27:08.480]  Yes, sir, go ahead.
[1:27:08.480 --> 1:27:09.480]  How you doing?
[1:27:09.480 --> 1:27:10.480]  Good, brother.
[1:27:10.480 --> 1:27:11.480]  So I'm calling.
[1:27:11.480 --> 1:27:18.280]  I know you're not too happy with social services and stuff like that, but I grew up with my
[1:27:18.280 --> 1:27:20.080]  parents being foster parents.
[1:27:20.080 --> 1:27:22.760]  Sir, I don't think all social services are bad.
[1:27:22.760 --> 1:27:23.760]  There's a lot of good people.
[1:27:23.760 --> 1:27:25.800]  There's a lot of bad people hiding in there.
[1:27:25.800 --> 1:27:27.280]  A lot of bad people hiding in there.
[1:27:27.280 --> 1:27:29.240]  Yes, that's for sure.
[1:27:29.240 --> 1:27:34.720]  My mother now, or my parents, did the emergency home here up in New York in this area.
[1:27:34.720 --> 1:27:42.360]  I don't want to get too much into it, but a few weeks ago, we got about three o'clock
[1:27:42.360 --> 1:27:51.320]  in the morning a little girl who didn't speak any English, with restrained bruises from
[1:27:51.320 --> 1:27:55.640]  her leg to her hands to her neck.
[1:27:55.640 --> 1:28:04.680]  She was handcuffed to one of those old radiator heaters to the person who spoke Spanish.
[1:28:04.680 --> 1:28:07.560]  You know, she was there for four days.
[1:28:07.560 --> 1:28:12.800]  They found her walking the railroad track at, like I said, three o'clock in the morning.
[1:28:12.800 --> 1:28:17.320]  She came to us for the weekend because, like I said, none of us, none of us in my family
[1:28:17.320 --> 1:28:19.920]  speak Spanish, you know?
[1:28:19.920 --> 1:28:23.960]  So it was very hard to talk to this little girl.
[1:28:23.960 --> 1:28:26.480]  But you know, my mom, like, gave her her, gave her a...
[1:28:26.480 --> 1:28:27.480]  Hold on, hold on.
[1:28:27.480 --> 1:28:28.640]  Don't hang up, Nicholas.
[1:28:28.640 --> 1:28:30.600]  We got to go to break.
[1:28:30.600 --> 1:28:32.360]  Where do the millions of children go?
[1:28:32.360 --> 1:28:33.760]  This is a microcosm example.
[1:28:33.760 --> 1:28:37.120]  You're about to hear what people are witnessing on the ground.
[1:28:37.120 --> 1:28:38.120]  Stay there, Nicholas.
[1:28:38.120 --> 1:28:39.120]  Don't hang up.
[1:28:39.120 --> 1:28:43.280]  I want to hear this start over when we come back and tell folks what you've witnessed.
[1:28:43.280 --> 1:28:45.600]  Man, unbelievable, all the stuff's going on.
[1:28:45.600 --> 1:28:48.560]  The footage we've got from the border, you can go down there any time you want.
[1:28:48.560 --> 1:28:52.160]  There'll just be hundreds of unaccompanied kids, many of them babies, it's being handed
[1:28:52.160 --> 1:28:58.600]  over to random men in vans.
[1:28:58.600 --> 1:29:03.440]  Think about a world without info wars.
[1:29:03.440 --> 1:29:07.720]  Just take a moment and sit back and think about all the incredible guests and callers
[1:29:07.720 --> 1:29:13.040]  and stories we've broken together, this family that is info wars.
[1:29:13.040 --> 1:29:18.160]  Think about how info wars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and Bolsonaro and
[1:29:18.160 --> 1:29:25.560]  other foreign leaders like Nigel Farage as being the main impetus towards firing up their
[1:29:25.560 --> 1:29:29.040]  main base to defeat the New World Order.
[1:29:29.040 --> 1:29:34.800]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today is because the viewers and listeners
[1:29:34.800 --> 1:29:39.280]  of this broadcast have taken action and supported this show.
[1:29:39.280 --> 1:29:42.880]  I don't take the credit, I give you the credit.
[1:29:42.880 --> 1:29:47.280]  And now info wars is facing its darkest hours, it isn't going to give up.
[1:29:47.280 --> 1:29:49.040]  Without your support we can be shut down.
[1:29:49.040 --> 1:29:58.320]  Please go to saveinfowars.com today, saveinfowars.com today and donate for our legal defense fund.
[1:29:58.320 --> 1:30:02.960]  Look around you, everything I predicted from the Globalistone documents from their own
[1:30:02.960 --> 1:30:04.960]  admissions is now happening.
[1:30:04.960 --> 1:30:09.440]  Info wars credibility, my credibility has never been higher and it's because of your
[1:30:09.440 --> 1:30:15.520]  backing of this operation that I could steadfastly, despite the censorship and the boycotts and
[1:30:15.520 --> 1:30:18.080]  the attacks and the lawsuits, stay on air.
[1:30:18.080 --> 1:30:23.000]  But now we're reaching the most critical juncture in the fight together.
[1:30:23.000 --> 1:30:29.280]  So I want to ask all of you today to help keep me on the air, in my decades on air I've
[1:30:29.280 --> 1:30:33.360]  never asked for personal donations, but I'm being forced by the bankruptcy court to pay
[1:30:33.360 --> 1:30:38.840]  for 40% of the legal fees and I can't fund those myself, it's unsustainable.
[1:30:38.840 --> 1:30:46.840]  So please visit saveinfowars.com, saveinfowars.com where you can make straight donations, five,
[1:30:46.840 --> 1:30:51.120]  ten, fifty hundred dollars, whatever you can, so that I can continue to persevere.
[1:30:51.120 --> 1:30:54.320]  I'll never give up, I'll never give in, but I could give out.
[1:30:54.320 --> 1:30:57.880]  Thank you for your support, would me or without you, saveinfowars.com.

[1:34:43.560 --> 1:34:49.000]  an hour, many times without their mothers, pregnant women, you name it, we have all the
[1:34:49.000 --> 1:34:53.120]  footage at the airport and on the street, the same woman handing off dozens of children
[1:34:53.120 --> 1:34:58.520]  saying it's her child, no paperwork, the men coming in loading little girls into cars,
[1:34:58.520 --> 1:35:03.000]  just disappearing around the country, here's some of that footage of your TV viewer, she
[1:35:03.000 --> 1:35:09.600]  comes in every hour on the flight, says this is my baby and just hands it to a woman and
[1:35:09.600 --> 1:35:15.680]  they just take the one year old baby through it, and there she is with her grim reaper
[1:35:15.680 --> 1:35:25.720]  tattoo from the church, so we're taking your phone calls, Nicholas in New York says that
[1:35:25.720 --> 1:35:32.160]  he is working with family that runs a children's shelter and they talked about a little Latin
[1:35:32.160 --> 1:35:36.880]  American girl that doesn't speak English with signs of restraints on her neck, ankles
[1:35:36.880 --> 1:35:42.040]  and wrists and that she had been chained to a radiator, please start over and continue
[1:35:42.040 --> 1:35:43.040]  sir.
[1:35:43.040 --> 1:35:52.120]  Yes, so yes, my parents are foster parents, this is the emergency home, this little girl
[1:35:52.120 --> 1:35:59.840]  was found wandering the railroad track at three o'clock in the morning by the police,
[1:35:59.840 --> 1:36:04.760]  they you know they brought her into the hospital, they you know went through and they found
[1:36:04.760 --> 1:36:12.680]  you know the multiple bruises, there was also she was the case worker indicated as well
[1:36:12.680 --> 1:36:21.160]  that she was violently sexually assaulted, you know so like I said she was here, she
[1:36:21.160 --> 1:36:29.200]  was at you know our house for two days, she left to go to a better location they said,
[1:36:29.200 --> 1:36:35.240]  you know within less than a week this little girl was back at our house for now a week
[1:36:35.240 --> 1:36:42.240]  this time though, you know because I don't know what the situation was but you know the
[1:36:42.240 --> 1:36:48.800]  bruises on her were so severe she was still bruised, you know they you know but then finally
[1:36:48.800 --> 1:36:57.160]  she went you know they found a Spanish speaking family that you know she was supposedly supposed
[1:36:57.160 --> 1:37:03.040]  to go to but you know believe me I mean the stuff I've seen it's enough to make you want
[1:37:03.040 --> 1:37:07.880]  to puke, it's disgusting the stuff that goes on with these children, it would give you
[1:37:07.880 --> 1:37:09.880]  nightmares.
[1:37:09.880 --> 1:37:17.040]  And my sister, my sister it took two years, we got her when she was about a year old,
[1:37:17.040 --> 1:37:22.600]  she's Korean and in Korea it was a single parent home they call them ghost children
[1:37:22.600 --> 1:37:27.480]  and they're scorned by society so that they have a big adoption program out of Korea,
[1:37:27.480 --> 1:37:31.920]  my mother couldn't have children after me from an IED that she got delcon, she older
[1:37:31.920 --> 1:37:35.520]  sterilized her, she want to settle in by the way that just shows what these companies do
[1:37:35.520 --> 1:37:36.520]  knowingly.
[1:37:36.520 --> 1:37:42.720]  My sister's great, this is much my sister if you know she was my blood, great person
[1:37:42.720 --> 1:37:47.600]  Marley she actually works here, 30 something years old now, the adopter when I was 15 years
[1:37:47.600 --> 1:37:54.200]  old and it took two years from the jump through hoops to be able to adopt and tons of money
[1:37:54.200 --> 1:37:58.720]  but they are now just taking children and randomly handing them out to men in vans,
[1:37:58.720 --> 1:38:02.760]  we videotaped it, they just disappear into the country, some are found dead, some are
[1:38:02.760 --> 1:38:07.880]  found in enslavement, senate report said tens of thousands are in sex slavery that's a US
[1:38:07.880 --> 1:38:14.960]  senate report, Trump stopped it, Biden continued it, Obama started it, so this is mass crimes
[1:38:14.960 --> 1:38:19.560]  against humanity, this is the left and you have all these democrats promoting pedophilia
[1:38:19.560 --> 1:38:24.720]  now and the main Spanish minister in Spain saying pedophilia is good, I mean that's who
[1:38:24.720 --> 1:38:31.560]  these people are, as the footage we shot of them loading busloads of kids on to 747s,
[1:38:31.560 --> 1:38:37.400]  737s and flying them out and it's just so criminal brother, anything else you'd like
[1:38:37.400 --> 1:38:39.200]  to add about this portable girl?
[1:38:39.200 --> 1:38:46.080]  Well, no, another thing that disgusts me is these people who come out saying that people
[1:38:46.080 --> 1:38:51.840]  shouldn't be allowed to adopt black children or Spanish children, you must be the same
[1:38:51.840 --> 1:38:59.800]  race because I have black, like I said, my parents adopted kids and they all have issues,
[1:38:59.800 --> 1:39:07.280]  so I have black brothers, Spanish brothers, and like you said, just as much my brothers
[1:39:07.280 --> 1:39:08.280]  as blood.
[1:39:08.280 --> 1:39:13.520]  Yeah, they don't want people to assimilate and they fight so hard, a friend of mine,
[1:39:13.520 --> 1:39:18.760]  he and his wife couldn't have children and so they adopted a disabled black child and
[1:39:18.760 --> 1:39:23.680]  there were racist black groups trying to stop them doing it, no, instead the black groups
[1:39:23.680 --> 1:39:27.720]  say just abort these black people, just kill them, again, they don't want us coming together,
[1:39:27.720 --> 1:39:31.400]  they want us in divided groups, it is disgusting, Nicholas, thank you so much for the call,
[1:39:31.400 --> 1:39:34.520]  God bless you, one last question, do we know what's going to happen to the little girl
[1:39:34.520 --> 1:39:41.480]  and how old is she, he's gone, it's just unbelievable folks, you got to go to the border and see
[1:39:41.480 --> 1:39:45.480]  it for yourself, I mean just tens of thousands you're watching daily, children being handed
[1:39:45.480 --> 1:39:52.000]  off to men that look like bigger pedophiles than Brian Stelter and I'm not saying Brian
[1:39:52.000 --> 1:39:56.000]  Stelter is a pedophile, I'm saying he looks super creepy, when I think of a pedophile
[1:39:56.000 --> 1:40:02.000]  I think of Brian Stelter and when you see these men, it is just the stuff they say
[1:40:02.000 --> 1:40:08.680]  to you too, I'm going to take them to Pennsylvania and show them the way of the Lord, why do
[1:40:08.680 --> 1:40:15.480]  you not want me to be here, he followed an undercover cop we sent in, he was threatening
[1:40:15.480 --> 1:40:20.280]  her inside, he followed her out and ran into us and was literally menacing us with the
[1:40:20.280 --> 1:40:25.080]  most evil eyes ladies and gentlemen and some of my guys literally had to just back off
[1:40:25.080 --> 1:40:30.240]  because they were about to attack him, I mean you physically see one of these guys, I'm
[1:40:30.240 --> 1:40:34.960]  taking these children, you're not going to stop me, you just want to attack, it's that
[1:40:34.960 --> 1:40:39.640]  close folks, it's that close, you saw me jumping on the hood of that car, there's a certain
[1:40:39.640 --> 1:40:45.960]  point where the rubber meets the road, I felt so guilty, I felt so guilty when I got back
[1:40:45.960 --> 1:40:52.120]  to our motel room, I might be in dramatic folks, that I started throwing up, that I
[1:40:52.120 --> 1:40:58.600]  sat there and let them load those kids on planes and I sat there and I watched it and
[1:40:58.600 --> 1:41:02.840]  meanwhile the left thinks it's all funny, if they can't abort a kid they want to smuggle
[1:41:02.840 --> 1:41:07.800]  them over the border so they can rape the hell out of them, remember the CIA run by
[1:41:07.800 --> 1:41:12.840]  leftists in Germany, hundreds of thousands of children placed with convicted pedophiles
[1:41:12.840 --> 1:41:18.120]  to create a new family based on men loving boys and women loving girls, pedophilia is
[1:41:18.120 --> 1:41:24.200]  their system, it's who they are, period, get it through your head and there's all these
[1:41:24.200 --> 1:41:30.000]  enablers that are just there to get the money to be part of it and after you go down the
[1:41:30.000 --> 1:41:33.760]  border six, seven times you don't want to go back, like I know there's a giant story
[1:41:33.760 --> 1:41:39.200]  down there and I should be down there, but I'll be honest with you, we can't go down
[1:41:39.200 --> 1:41:47.480]  there because my crew agrees, they want to start, it's a weird needle to thread, but
[1:41:47.480 --> 1:41:55.480]  if you can't stop them smuggling even if you expose it you still feel dirty, this whole
[1:41:55.480 --> 1:42:02.200]  country is aiding and abetting child trafficking and I'm going to say it, I feel guilty that
[1:42:02.200 --> 1:42:07.600]  I've not done enough, I'm serious, imagine the people that think it's funny, maybe like
[1:42:07.600 --> 1:42:13.720]  if you saw your neighbor torturing their child with electrical wires, you call the cops they
[1:42:13.720 --> 1:42:18.280]  do nothing, you keep seeing it, you either go over and you kill your neighbor and I'm
[1:42:18.280 --> 1:42:23.080]  not saying do that, do not do that, or you move because you can't keep watching it,
[1:42:23.080 --> 1:42:26.800]  now you're aiding and abetting it, the police won't do anything and every Saturday night
[1:42:26.800 --> 1:42:31.080]  at 6 p.m. the dad puts the daughter in the backyard and hooks electrodes up to her feet
[1:42:31.080 --> 1:42:35.840]  and starts shocking her, that's a hypothetical and the police won't do anything so at a certain
[1:42:35.840 --> 1:42:39.640]  point you don't go over and beat his ass or you'll go to jail because they'll prosecute
[1:42:39.640 --> 1:42:47.040]  you, you just move and just let them torture the girl and now you're guilty, no, I think
[1:42:47.040 --> 1:42:49.800]  you go over and stop him and then let a jury try it and I think you're going to be let
[1:42:49.800 --> 1:42:58.600]  off, I mean we're getting close to vigilante time here, we'll be right back.

[1:49:18.120 --> 1:49:22.200]  up is there any way you could put them on your show and there's quite a few more that
[1:49:22.200 --> 1:49:26.680]  i've been looking up that i think if people saw it maybe they could show them to other
[1:49:26.680 --> 1:49:31.560]  people and wake them up absolutely you know i first put out conspiracy of silence the
[1:49:31.560 --> 1:49:35.520]  filmmakers gave it to me it was supposed to air on history channel and didn't not toot
[1:49:35.520 --> 1:49:43.760]  my horn we first put that out in like 1997 massive death threats and they even sent people
[1:49:43.760 --> 1:49:48.200]  to try to beat me up in a parking lot luckily they weren't really professionals because
[1:49:48.200 --> 1:49:51.120]  four of them should have been able to deal with me but they didn't they broke my nose
[1:49:51.120 --> 1:49:56.040]  but that was part of it so yeah so you're bringing flashbacks to me when you're talking
[1:49:56.040 --> 1:50:03.680]  about conspiracy of silence that documentary why don't you tell folks about it oh my it's
[1:50:03.680 --> 1:50:11.520]  a movie that they tried to put out but from what i understand the it was bought out from
[1:50:11.520 --> 1:50:17.480]  the bush family bought it out and they stopped it from being aired and it shows how back
[1:50:17.480 --> 1:50:23.840]  from when the children were going to the white house and they'd call them call boys and no
[1:50:23.840 --> 1:50:30.040]  that's a child that you're prostituting that's that's rape that's nope but um they stopped
[1:50:30.040 --> 1:50:35.800]  the movie from being seen and it is videos out and it is on youtube and you can look
[1:50:35.800 --> 1:50:41.760]  it up um i just want people to see it it's it's how they steal the kids and it it all
[1:50:41.760 --> 1:50:48.720]  started with me with was with shiny gosh you're right and he's we will take conspiracy silence
[1:50:48.720 --> 1:50:52.920]  and put it on band-aid video in fact just just tell one of the crew to post conspiracy
[1:50:52.920 --> 1:50:57.160]  of silence up there absolutely and you know ted gunnerson what a great patriot he was tapped
[1:50:57.160 --> 1:51:02.180]  me the fbi director but uh they stopped him from it he was a really old school guy great
[1:51:02.180 --> 1:51:05.880]  guy but he would tell me this stuff and i found it hard to believe everything he said
[1:51:05.880 --> 1:51:12.800]  later came out i mean it's just a whole towns run by devil worshipers uh the finders case
[1:51:12.800 --> 1:51:20.320]  uh dc in a whole uh four-story building uh full of snuff film production crews i mean
[1:51:20.320 --> 1:51:26.360]  you talk about hell on earth it's unbelievable oh my there's some other ones like the truth
[1:51:26.360 --> 1:51:36.240]  about anarchy is a good one and um another title is the american dream and it's um like
[1:51:36.240 --> 1:51:42.120]  a cartoon well so is kind of the truth about anarchy they they tell it in cartoon form
[1:51:42.120 --> 1:51:46.440]  but a lot of people won't listen unless you know you make it as simple as possible no
[1:51:46.440 --> 1:51:52.360]  i agree i haven't seen that i'll look it up and another lady is kitty worthman k i t
[1:51:52.360 --> 1:52:01.080]  y w e r t h m a n n and she was from world war two in austria and everything that you
[1:52:01.080 --> 1:52:07.080]  say she says and she tells people it's coming and this was under obama i i believe she has
[1:52:07.080 --> 1:52:14.440]  never heard of her what's her name again this is fast kitty what kitty worth um w e r t
[1:52:14.440 --> 1:52:20.640]  h m a n n all right guys get me that i'll look at it thank you so much kim we love you we
[1:52:20.640 --> 1:52:25.480]  appreciate you all right let's take another caller here uh let's talk to carlos in canada
[1:52:25.480 --> 1:52:32.040]  carlos you're on the air welcome thank you alex good afternoon it's when the world economic
[1:52:32.040 --> 1:52:39.040]  forum uh does its business that we suffer globally uh this is an organization which
[1:52:39.040 --> 1:52:45.360]  i've you know deemed in the past to you as using uh smokes and mirrors uh sort of a glorified
[1:52:45.360 --> 1:52:52.200]  chamber of commerce now these people of course they represent interests of portfolio owners
[1:52:52.200 --> 1:52:59.800]  portfolio holders um what you would call shareholders but they choose to call it stakeholders and
[1:52:59.800 --> 1:53:05.520]  because of the great portfolios they have accumulated over many many decades of years
[1:53:05.520 --> 1:53:13.760]  largely in the hands of a few uh families but essentially uh managed by uh vanguard
[1:53:13.760 --> 1:53:20.080]  and uh black rock of course uh which are well known um along with others they can uh speak
[1:53:20.080 --> 1:53:27.200]  for 20 to more trillion dollars of portfolios that they manage and their interest of course
[1:53:27.200 --> 1:53:31.360]  is to have a return on investment and they are leveraging us into a global forced i d
[1:53:31.360 --> 1:53:35.920]  carbon tax social credit score programmable digital tokens they're driving the whole thing
[1:53:36.800 --> 1:53:43.120]  yeah we have to take this organization apart because number one alex if they really meant
[1:53:43.120 --> 1:53:49.520]  to give us a new world order then why why the evil stuff there's no need there's technological
[1:53:49.520 --> 1:53:53.680]  progress that can be brought in like to kill people they like control they like human sacrifice
[1:53:53.680 --> 1:54:00.800]  they're bad people right they want to return on investment you see at any cost and it you know
[1:54:00.800 --> 1:54:07.120]  like when you hear and you have video of it of of um bill gates saying oh vaccines gave me up to
[1:54:07.120 --> 1:54:12.960]  20 percent return that's better than anything else this is a man who didn't say 20 he said 20 times
[1:54:13.840 --> 1:54:20.720]  20 oh good for you well there you are the return on investment is what's driving a lot of these
[1:54:20.720 --> 1:54:26.800]  things but they are in an inversion alex this is why i for years and years i have told people as
[1:54:26.800 --> 1:54:32.480]  long as they don't change the constitution of united states you have 50 states you have 50 presidents
[1:54:32.480 --> 1:54:38.640]  with 50 in the sense uh mandates to take care of their people you have no governance when you
[1:54:38.640 --> 1:54:44.000]  have no judicial jurisdiction you have enemies of the state like george soros running around
[1:54:44.000 --> 1:54:48.720]  financing things that you know very well have cost a lot of money no i totally agree what do you
[1:54:48.720 --> 1:54:52.800]  think about the Nord Stream 2 getting blown up trump says he'll head a group for an emergency
[1:54:52.800 --> 1:54:57.600]  peace deal with russia i agree we need peace now this is escalating out of control what do you
[1:54:57.600 --> 1:55:03.520]  say about that well i'd be uh i'm glad you mentioned that because i've been as you know i've been
[1:55:03.520 --> 1:55:09.520]  doing a semantic analysis an algorithm that i invented some years ago and when i look at this
[1:55:09.520 --> 1:55:15.600]  look look at from the perspective that is not being seen which the the the the semantic analysis
[1:55:15.600 --> 1:55:23.440]  is giving me it's saying carlos listen carefully okay when you block the pipelines now you guarantee
[1:55:23.440 --> 1:55:29.280]  that russia is going to protect the single pipeline that go through ukraine now you're talking about a
[1:55:29.280 --> 1:55:35.920]  situation where if if you if there's an emergency russia has contractual obligations to deliver gas
[1:55:35.920 --> 1:55:42.160]  through ukraine so now that you cut and stupidly done what they've done whoever's done it now you
[1:55:42.160 --> 1:55:48.480]  have no reason to stop russia from taking over the whole territory to protect the interests of
[1:55:48.480 --> 1:55:54.480]  contractual obligations to europe so what do you think is going to happen it's not it's going to be
[1:55:54.480 --> 1:56:00.400]  no nuclear disaster it's going to be simply a military takeover to protect the interests of europe
[1:56:00.400 --> 1:56:08.800]  versus russia so to me it is insane now with regards to the pipelines themselves okay there are all
[1:56:08.800 --> 1:56:18.640]  sorts of reasons why it brings together um russia and europe hold on carlos i'm gonna i'm gonna do

[1:58:09.040 --> 1:58:17.600]  leaders like nigel forage as being the main impetus towards firing up their main base to defeat the

[2:00:05.080 --> 2:00:11.400]  Who really stands to gain from the Nord Stream Pipeline being reportedly blown up?
[2:00:11.400 --> 2:00:14.520]  Well, we know there's a lot of different forces of play here.
[2:00:14.520 --> 2:00:15.920]  We'll talk to Joel Scousen about it coming up.
[2:00:15.920 --> 2:00:18.760]  I wanted to have about a minute, finish up with Carlos, take a few more calls for Joel
[2:00:18.760 --> 2:00:19.760]  Scousen joins us.
[2:00:19.760 --> 2:00:22.520]  Carlos, so what was your point you were making about the pipelines?
[2:00:22.520 --> 2:00:29.240]  Well, I was basically saying that if you consider that the other suppliers that are going to
[2:00:29.240 --> 2:00:36.800]  be coming in have to charge more than Russia would for the gas prices that they were making
[2:00:36.800 --> 2:00:37.800]  it available.
[2:00:37.800 --> 2:00:43.240]  You now have an unofficial inflated price that has to be paid to other suppliers because
[2:00:43.240 --> 2:00:45.160]  of what has been done.
[2:00:45.160 --> 2:00:48.680]  So this is something that has not helped Europe at all.
[2:00:48.680 --> 2:00:56.680]  Second of all, it indicates that the Russian government has now to mobilize more people
[2:00:56.680 --> 2:00:58.560]  in the defense of the territories.
[2:00:58.560 --> 2:01:03.800]  So yes, 300,000 new recruits are coming in, but that's because they're planning to basically
[2:01:03.800 --> 2:01:07.880]  go city by city, in other words, the plans are to take over cities.
[2:01:07.880 --> 2:01:13.560]  You don't bring in 300,000 new members unless you're going to go soldiers, unless you're
[2:01:13.560 --> 2:01:15.240]  going to go city by city.
[2:01:15.240 --> 2:01:17.720]  So yeah, it's very, very possible.
[2:01:17.720 --> 2:01:21.960]  What I said is that the pipelines will have to be protected from terrorism, and that means
[2:01:21.960 --> 2:01:26.920]  you have to denatify Ukraine and demilitarize it.
[2:01:26.920 --> 2:01:30.280]  And where have I heard that before?
[2:01:30.280 --> 2:01:34.360]  Russia, do you think Russia could have done this as a false flag?
[2:01:34.360 --> 2:01:38.640]  Well, Russia never used the Nord Stream 2.
[2:01:38.640 --> 2:01:41.920]  It was sitting there attempting the use of it.
[2:01:41.920 --> 2:01:45.560]  People in Germany were advising politicians were saying, let's do it, let's do it.
[2:01:45.560 --> 2:01:46.560]  It was sitting there.
[2:01:46.560 --> 2:01:51.960]  So this action is very timely to make sure that Nord Stream 2 and Nord Stream 1 are not
[2:01:51.960 --> 2:01:53.880]  on service for the winter.
[2:01:53.880 --> 2:01:58.440]  So if there was a real winter crisis coming to Europe, would they be doing that?
[2:01:58.440 --> 2:02:00.240]  Who would be destroying these pipelines?
[2:02:00.240 --> 2:02:04.800]  If it wasn't simply because they have alternatives that are more expensive, and they have to
[2:02:04.800 --> 2:02:08.360]  pay that price otherwise, opening the Nord Stream 2.
[2:02:08.360 --> 2:02:13.200]  Just like when the feds wouldn't give Texas authorization to turn up the coal plants a
[2:02:13.200 --> 2:02:17.680]  year and a half ago, and then they made $40-something million in just two weeks, gouging us with
[2:02:17.680 --> 2:02:18.680]  outside power.
[2:02:18.680 --> 2:02:19.680]  Okay.
[2:02:19.680 --> 2:02:20.680]  Carlos, thanks for the call.
[2:02:20.680 --> 2:02:22.480]  We'll get Joel Scowze's take on this.
[2:02:22.480 --> 2:02:23.480]  Coming up in just a moment.
[2:02:23.480 --> 2:02:26.480]  Al Killer in Virginia, thanks for holding her on the air.
[2:02:26.480 --> 2:02:33.320]  Well, Alex, if your hand still works, I'll give you $200 for a personal two-alkiller
[2:02:33.320 --> 2:02:37.200]  signbook of your new great resale work.
[2:02:37.200 --> 2:02:38.200]  You got it.
[2:02:38.200 --> 2:02:39.960]  Mail a letter in with a request, and I'll do it.
[2:02:39.960 --> 2:02:44.160]  We should do that with mail-in requests I could do, customize things to fund this operation.
[2:02:44.160 --> 2:02:45.160]  That's a great idea.
[2:02:45.160 --> 2:02:46.160]  Thanks, Al Killer.
[2:02:46.160 --> 2:02:47.160]  What else on your mind?
[2:02:47.160 --> 2:02:55.360]  So, you know, talking about the clear bombing of Nord Stream 2, they just reset the world
[2:02:55.360 --> 2:02:57.640]  with that.
[2:02:57.640 --> 2:02:59.920]  Europe's done.
[2:02:59.920 --> 2:03:10.160]  After this winter, and everybody's liquid natural gas run out that they've been stockpiling,
[2:03:10.160 --> 2:03:11.160]  it's over.
[2:03:11.160 --> 2:03:13.480]  They just reset Europe.
[2:03:13.480 --> 2:03:19.320]  We're blessed in this country that all it takes is somebody with the right mindset to
[2:03:19.320 --> 2:03:24.480]  take advantage of the natural resources we have here, so we're inflated in that sense,
[2:03:24.480 --> 2:03:34.160]  but they just reset Europe because with the policies over here, we're artificially reset.
[2:03:34.160 --> 2:03:40.760]  Every problem we have here is a self-inflicted wound, but they just enacted the great reset.
[2:03:40.760 --> 2:03:41.760]  I don't think people...
[2:03:41.760 --> 2:03:45.840]  Well, they're already paying 700% to 900% more for natural gas.
[2:03:45.840 --> 2:03:46.840]  What is this going to do?
[2:03:46.840 --> 2:03:51.440]  Even though the pipeline hadn't been turned on yet, it just doesn't give them the ability
[2:03:51.440 --> 2:03:52.440]  to turn it on.
[2:03:52.440 --> 2:03:57.080]  It's a threat by Putin that he'll just blow up the other pipeline, and then he doesn't
[2:03:57.080 --> 2:04:00.440]  have to take responsibility that he's cut off power to Europe.
[2:04:00.440 --> 2:04:02.440]  And Putin said, I'm not bluffing.
[2:04:02.440 --> 2:04:07.040]  Is this the prelude to tactical nuclear weapons and more?
[2:04:07.040 --> 2:04:09.360]  This is a very dangerous situation.
[2:04:09.360 --> 2:04:13.520]  The CIA warned a month ago that Der Spiegel was reporting to the German government that
[2:04:13.520 --> 2:04:17.800]  they thought either Ukrainians or the Russians might do it and that the Russians might be
[2:04:17.800 --> 2:04:21.240]  involved, but then you've got the Klaus Schwab group that wants destabilization.
[2:04:21.240 --> 2:04:23.320]  They'll get Joe Scowze's take straight ahead.
[2:04:23.320 --> 2:04:25.480]  Anything else, Al Keller?
[2:04:25.480 --> 2:04:27.560]  I would disagree with that.
[2:04:27.560 --> 2:04:31.760]  That it would be Russia that did it for the simple fact that you just look at the timing.
[2:04:31.760 --> 2:04:34.760]  You had the Italian elections that just happened.
[2:04:34.760 --> 2:04:35.760]  They know...
[2:04:35.760 --> 2:04:36.760]  Well, I'm sure.
[2:04:36.760 --> 2:04:38.640]  Well, listen, I can't wait to hear what Joe Scowze has to say.
[2:04:38.640 --> 2:04:42.000]  You know, you're supposed to be the size as a talk show host, and I'm the size of most
[2:04:42.000 --> 2:04:43.800]  of the time because I'm usually know what I'm talking about.
[2:04:43.800 --> 2:04:45.360]  I don't know who did this.
[2:04:45.360 --> 2:04:46.360]  I just know this.
[2:04:46.360 --> 2:04:49.640]  Just things get crazier and more out of control on a daily basis.
[2:04:49.640 --> 2:04:58.640]  Back in 60 seconds with the head of World Affairs Brief, Joe Scowze, and stay with us.
[2:04:58.640 --> 2:05:00.520]  Look around you.
[2:05:00.520 --> 2:05:04.200]  Everything I predicted from the globalist documents, from their own admissions, is now
[2:05:04.200 --> 2:05:05.200]  happening.
[2:05:05.200 --> 2:05:06.920]  Info wars credibility.
[2:05:06.920 --> 2:05:11.360]  My credibility has never been higher, and it's because of your backing of this operation
[2:05:11.360 --> 2:05:17.200]  that I could steadfastly, despite the censorship and the boycotts and the attacks and the lawsuits
[2:05:17.200 --> 2:05:18.200]  stay on air.
[2:05:18.200 --> 2:05:23.200]  But now we're reaching the most critical juncture in the fight together.
[2:05:23.200 --> 2:05:28.480]  So I want to ask all of you today to help keep me on the air.
[2:05:28.480 --> 2:05:32.400]  In my decades on air, I've never asked for personal donations, but I'm being forced by
[2:05:32.400 --> 2:05:37.920]  the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees, and I can't fund those myself.
[2:05:37.920 --> 2:05:38.920]  It's unsustainable.
[2:05:38.920 --> 2:05:43.600]  So please visit saveinfowars.com.
[2:05:43.600 --> 2:05:50.640]  You can make straight donations, $5, $10, $50, $100, whatever you can, so that I can continue
[2:05:50.640 --> 2:05:51.640]  to persevere.
[2:05:51.640 --> 2:05:52.640]  I'll never give up.
[2:05:52.640 --> 2:05:53.640]  I'll never give in.
[2:05:53.640 --> 2:05:54.640]  But I could give out.
[2:05:54.640 --> 2:05:55.640]  Thank you for your support.
[2:05:55.640 --> 2:05:56.640]  Wouldn't be without you.
[2:05:56.640 --> 2:06:22.840]  Saveinfowars.
[2:06:22.840 --> 2:06:27.440]  I really wanted to get Joe Scalzen here on the Alex Jones show in the third hour to give
[2:06:27.440 --> 2:06:35.240]  his take on this disaster that Soros helped engineer with Ukraine, but obviously Russia
[2:06:35.240 --> 2:06:36.240]  has got its own issues.
[2:06:36.240 --> 2:06:38.880]  I don't support Russia invading Ukraine.
[2:06:38.880 --> 2:06:42.320]  I said early on, I think this is going to turn into a disaster and that Putin's walked
[2:06:42.320 --> 2:06:45.120]  into a trap.
[2:06:45.120 --> 2:06:49.920]  JoeScalzen.com, World Affairs Brief.com, he's the editor of the World Affairs Brief.
[2:06:49.920 --> 2:06:53.880]  He's also the best-selling author of Strategic Relocation, North American Guide to State
[2:06:53.880 --> 2:06:54.880]  Places.
[2:06:54.880 --> 2:06:58.720]  We sell the book at infowarsstore.com and a documentary film, we made about it.
[2:06:58.720 --> 2:07:02.600]  And quite frankly, I'm a little selfish here.
[2:07:02.600 --> 2:07:05.520]  Joel was happy to come on about Russia and those issues.
[2:07:05.520 --> 2:07:06.720]  I want to spend some time on that.
[2:07:06.720 --> 2:07:11.840]  But then I want to talk about strategic relocation and the supply chain breakdown and the crime
[2:07:11.840 --> 2:07:18.560]  and the open borders and the energy crisis that's getting closer and closer because I'm
[2:07:18.560 --> 2:07:23.400]  really getting concerned about my family and I'm still here in Austin.
[2:07:23.400 --> 2:07:27.320]  But if they turn the power off or take us off air, then I am going to go ahead and move
[2:07:27.320 --> 2:07:32.160]  with my family to try to weather this out and hopefully telephones will still work.
[2:07:32.160 --> 2:07:35.280]  I'll be able to call into shows and communicate with folks some way.
[2:07:35.280 --> 2:07:38.880]  But the World Economic Forum has declared war on free speech.
[2:07:38.880 --> 2:07:43.080]  They've said they want to shut down anybody questioning anything the New World Order is
[2:07:43.080 --> 2:07:44.080]  doing.
[2:07:44.080 --> 2:07:49.060]  So there is an authoritarian race by Russia, China, the U.S. with the globalists manipulating
[2:07:49.060 --> 2:07:55.240]  it all into this authoritarian revolution, this italitarian reality we're rapidly moving
[2:07:55.240 --> 2:07:56.240]  into.
[2:07:56.240 --> 2:08:00.560]  So Joel Schkausen, let's walk through the waterfront here.
[2:08:00.560 --> 2:08:04.200]  Maybe we should start at the beginning, February, the Russian invasion.
[2:08:04.200 --> 2:08:05.200]  What's happened then?
[2:08:05.200 --> 2:08:06.800]  How do you think the Russians are doing?
[2:08:06.800 --> 2:08:11.480]  The escalation by NATO, Putin saying I'm not bluffing, now Nord Stream 2 blows up and
[2:08:11.480 --> 2:08:13.640]  then just try to put all the pieces together.
[2:08:13.640 --> 2:08:19.560]  Or you could just start at the end and give us your summation and then reverse engineer
[2:08:19.560 --> 2:08:20.560]  it.
[2:08:20.560 --> 2:08:22.160]  How would you like to begin?
[2:08:22.160 --> 2:08:28.600]  Well, you know, there's a major battle going on within the conservative community.
[2:08:28.600 --> 2:08:34.280]  The conservatives are legitimately anti-globalists, that is, our major domestic threat.
[2:08:34.280 --> 2:08:38.840]  But you know, there's so many that have made the mistake of thinking because the globalists
[2:08:38.840 --> 2:08:41.720]  are against Russia, the Russia must be the good guy.
[2:08:41.720 --> 2:08:44.680]  There are no good guys in this foreign policy world anymore.
[2:08:44.680 --> 2:08:49.680]  There's a deep state operation throughout the West run by our own deep state.
[2:08:49.680 --> 2:08:55.560]  But Russia and China are also in collusion to be able to bring them out their own version
[2:08:55.560 --> 2:08:56.920]  of the New World Order.
[2:08:56.920 --> 2:09:00.440]  And as I pointed out in your show several months ago at the beginning of this Ukraine
[2:09:00.440 --> 2:09:03.240]  crisis, Russia faked its own demise.
[2:09:03.240 --> 2:09:06.600]  The Communist Party never did give up power.
[2:09:06.600 --> 2:09:10.280]  They simply went underground in the phony fall of the Soviet Union.
[2:09:10.280 --> 2:09:14.600]  Myself and Christopher Storey, the UK were the only two that really documented carefully
[2:09:14.600 --> 2:09:17.880]  why this was a phony fall.
[2:09:17.880 --> 2:09:25.920]  And so in the phony fall, they kept most of the Communist bureaucrats in Poland, in Czechoslovakia,
[2:09:25.920 --> 2:09:28.960]  in Romania, in Hungary, in Ukraine.
[2:09:28.960 --> 2:09:30.720]  Well, they didn't just do that.
[2:09:30.720 --> 2:09:37.280]  They sent them to take over the EU bureaucracy, something like 60% of the EU bureaucracy are
[2:09:37.280 --> 2:09:40.360]  former high-level Communist operatives.
[2:09:40.360 --> 2:09:45.760]  Well, that's right, you know, including, you know, the current chief and the former chief
[2:09:45.760 --> 2:09:52.400]  of the German Republic, you know, both former Communist of East Germany.
[2:09:52.400 --> 2:09:56.720]  And but, you know, it's hard to tell whether they've been bought out by the globalists
[2:09:56.720 --> 2:09:59.480]  like Tony Blair was and like Barack Obama was.
[2:09:59.480 --> 2:10:02.920]  He turned, he was a Communist originally, and then he was bought out and made wealthy
[2:10:02.920 --> 2:10:05.520]  by the globalists to switch sides.
[2:10:05.520 --> 2:10:09.960]  Not a very complex situation, difficult to understand, but there's corruption in every
[2:10:09.960 --> 2:10:12.160]  aspect of the phony fall of the Soviet Union.
[2:10:12.160 --> 2:10:18.360]  For example, Lech Walesa of Poland was a Communist agent, masquerading as a pro-liberty of freedom-minded
[2:10:18.360 --> 2:10:19.360]  persons.
[2:10:19.360 --> 2:10:22.280]  So was Vaklav Havel of the Czech Republic.
[2:10:22.280 --> 2:10:28.760]  And so every one of the Ukraine Prime Ministers after the phony fall were, in fact, Moscow
[2:10:28.760 --> 2:10:33.120]  puppets, including Yulia Timoshenko.
[2:10:33.120 --> 2:10:39.360]  And of course, there were some outright Communists like Viktor Yanukovych, who was the Prime Minister
[2:10:39.360 --> 2:10:45.480]  during the apparent Maidan coup in 2014.
[2:10:45.480 --> 2:10:50.040]  But as I've outlined very carefully in the World Affairs Brief, just as the Russians
[2:10:50.040 --> 2:10:56.440]  falsified their own demise in order to get Western aid and trade, which really helped
[2:10:56.440 --> 2:11:02.640]  rebuild the Soviet Union or in Russia, that we rebuilt their entire oil industry, in Ukraine
[2:11:02.640 --> 2:11:04.680]  as well.
[2:11:04.680 --> 2:11:08.520]  There was a lot of corruption, there was a lot of control, and it's very difficult to
[2:11:08.520 --> 2:11:12.040]  detect who's good and who's bad.
[2:11:12.040 --> 2:11:19.200]  But eventually, the Ukrainians after the 2014 Revolution, which appeared to win, the West
[2:11:19.200 --> 2:11:26.680]  appeared to win, elected another phony pro-Moscow named Piotr Poroshenko.
[2:11:26.680 --> 2:11:29.800]  Now, he claimed to be pro-Western.
[2:11:29.800 --> 2:11:37.360]  Let me explain very carefully in a short period in summary why this coup, so-called coup in
[2:11:37.360 --> 2:11:45.200]  February of 2014, was a Russian false coup made to look like the Western people had won.
[2:11:45.200 --> 2:11:47.880]  In order to, they had a Communist president.
[2:11:47.880 --> 2:11:55.000]  You had Viktor Yanukovych, who was very unpopular, and that's why there was a protest movement.
[2:11:55.000 --> 2:11:57.520]  And the globalists did fund that protested movement.
[2:11:57.520 --> 2:12:02.320]  There's no question, Victoria Newland was involved in that, et cetera.
[2:12:02.320 --> 2:12:07.200]  But when it came time to actually winning the protest, remember they were bottled up
[2:12:07.200 --> 2:12:12.880]  in the Maidan Square there in Kyiv for many, many months, surrounded by the Berkut, which
[2:12:12.880 --> 2:12:14.480]  is the riot police.
[2:12:14.480 --> 2:12:15.800]  They couldn't leave.
[2:12:15.800 --> 2:12:18.920]  They could smuggle things in to support the protesters.
[2:12:18.920 --> 2:12:25.000]  But in, on a Thursday, Yanukovych claimed that he was meeting with the protest leaders
[2:12:25.000 --> 2:12:30.440]  and cut a deal whereby he would stay in power, but they would have certain powers, et cetera,
[2:12:30.440 --> 2:12:32.760]  and that they would end the protest.
[2:12:32.760 --> 2:12:37.360]  Well, the protesters refused to accept that because they said, hey, the people he chose
[2:12:37.360 --> 2:12:41.520]  as our leaders aren't the real leaders, they're puppets, et cetera.
[2:12:41.520 --> 2:12:48.000]  But on Friday, that Friday, in February, suddenly the Berkut, the riot police, stayed
[2:12:48.000 --> 2:12:49.000]  in their barracks.
[2:12:49.000 --> 2:12:52.920]  In fact, the guards on the presidential palace didn't show up to guard anything.
[2:12:52.920 --> 2:12:56.920]  And the protesters were free to leave and so-called win.
[2:12:56.920 --> 2:13:00.320]  They went into the presidential palace, they went into the parliament building.
[2:13:00.320 --> 2:13:03.200]  The Berkut was nowhere to be seen.
[2:13:03.200 --> 2:13:07.720]  And then the next day on Saturday, the Communist Party and their allies, which had a majority
[2:13:07.720 --> 2:13:14.200]  in the Rada, which is the Ukrainian parliament, ousted their own president, Viktor Yanukovych,
[2:13:14.200 --> 2:13:19.040]  and he fled claiming to flee for his life, even though the protesters were not armed.
[2:13:19.040 --> 2:13:25.800]  This has all the signs of a false coup because only President Yanukovych could have given
[2:13:25.800 --> 2:13:29.280]  the orders to the Berkut to stay in their barracks.
[2:13:29.280 --> 2:13:34.560]  That's as if the Trump protesters were protesting in Washington, D.C., and suddenly the Marines
[2:13:34.560 --> 2:13:39.960]  stayed in their barracks, and the Democrats ousted Joe Biden.
[2:13:39.960 --> 2:13:42.480]  I mean, who would believe that as a real coup?
[2:13:42.480 --> 2:13:43.480]  It wasn't a real coup.
[2:13:43.480 --> 2:13:44.480]  Okay, so that's some of the background.
[2:13:44.480 --> 2:13:46.360]  And I want you to fill in the history and to get to the current things.
[2:13:46.360 --> 2:13:50.120]  Everybody's tuned in for that, it's an important background, but Russia is getting its ass
[2:13:50.120 --> 2:13:52.000]  kicked from what I see.
[2:13:52.000 --> 2:13:56.240]  And so why would they then do all this and set this up and then want to get in a war with
[2:13:56.240 --> 2:13:57.240]  NATO?
[2:13:57.240 --> 2:14:00.920]  I mean, to me, it doesn't look like it's going well.
[2:14:00.920 --> 2:14:05.120]  You have to understand the ending of that phony-may-dong coup to understand why they
[2:14:05.120 --> 2:14:06.760]  got into the war.
[2:14:06.760 --> 2:14:16.200]  The purpose of that was to elect another pro-Western appearing president, Piotr Poroshenko, who
[2:14:16.200 --> 2:14:21.120]  would in fact antagonize the people of the Donbass, the Russian-speaking people of the
[2:14:21.120 --> 2:14:22.120]  Donbass.
[2:14:22.120 --> 2:14:23.600]  He would antagonize them.
[2:14:23.600 --> 2:14:28.400]  Now, if Viktor Yanukovych, the Communist, was still in power, he couldn't get away with
[2:14:28.400 --> 2:14:32.120]  antagonizing the Russian-speaking people because he's their ally.
[2:14:32.120 --> 2:14:35.280]  And then they would have a president they controlled that would antagonize, they could
[2:14:35.280 --> 2:14:37.560]  then annex a third of the country.
[2:14:37.560 --> 2:14:38.560]  That's right.
[2:14:38.560 --> 2:14:39.560]  So what did Putin do?
[2:14:39.560 --> 2:14:46.120]  He did annex, or at least he went in and invaded the Donbass, and he annexed Crimea.
[2:14:46.120 --> 2:14:52.240]  Just upon Poroshenko threatening the people, in fact, just this week, Putin said, any country
[2:14:52.240 --> 2:14:58.240]  that has Russian people in it, I am justified in using military force to come in and protect
[2:14:58.240 --> 2:15:00.360]  them if they are a threat.
[2:15:00.360 --> 2:15:01.360]  All right?
[2:15:01.360 --> 2:15:03.840]  And that's why Russia put the Donbass.
[2:15:03.840 --> 2:15:06.080]  Remember, Russia did this, not the West.
[2:15:06.080 --> 2:15:09.080]  The Russian put the Donbass into Ukraine's boundaries.
[2:15:09.080 --> 2:15:12.320]  Okay, so you've covered the background, we're going to go to break, and then speed through
[2:15:12.320 --> 2:15:14.800]  it and get to currently, because I really want to... I mean, people want to know what
[2:15:14.800 --> 2:15:19.880]  you think about the pipeline, the future of this, Putin saying, everything's on the table,
[2:15:19.880 --> 2:15:24.960]  I'm not bluffing, how big of a threat of nuclear war is, with Joel Scalzen of World

[2:20:46.640 --> 2:20:49.520]  Joe Scowze, please continue.
[2:20:49.520 --> 2:20:50.520]  Thanks Alex.
[2:20:50.520 --> 2:20:56.400]  So as I summarized, Russia has always intended to take back Ukraine and Eastern Europe again
[2:20:56.400 --> 2:21:01.320]  after they had gained aid and trade and they began with Ukraine, which is an essential,
[2:21:01.320 --> 2:21:05.280]  if you're ever going to go to the war with the West, which Putin fully intends to do.
[2:21:05.280 --> 2:21:07.920]  That's what all these nuclear weapons are about.
[2:21:07.920 --> 2:21:12.840]  You got to start with Ukraine, which has the most industrial and agricultural might of
[2:21:12.840 --> 2:21:15.240]  the former Soviet Union.
[2:21:15.240 --> 2:21:19.480]  But he thought it was going to be a walk in the park when he attacked because of so much
[2:21:19.480 --> 2:21:24.320]  corruption in Ukraine, so many communists that were back in the back pocket there that
[2:21:24.320 --> 2:21:28.360]  he felt would help sabotage the Ukrainian effort.
[2:21:28.360 --> 2:21:34.040]  But it didn't work out that way because the West was able to convince Ukrainian leaders.
[2:21:34.040 --> 2:21:40.720]  And by the way, for all his faults, Volodymyr Zelensky, his only virtue is that he's not
[2:21:40.720 --> 2:21:41.720]  a Russian puppet.
[2:21:41.720 --> 2:21:45.280]  It's the first president of Ukraine that isn't a Russian puppet.
[2:21:45.280 --> 2:21:50.440]  And even though he's got morally questionable behavior and other background and is more
[2:21:50.440 --> 2:21:55.640]  or less a puppet of the West, at least he's not a Russian puppet.
[2:21:55.640 --> 2:22:00.320]  And so he is trying to defend the country, and the West is trying to defend the country.
[2:22:00.320 --> 2:22:04.320]  And Ukraine does deserve to be a defended effect.
[2:22:04.320 --> 2:22:09.080]  Russia has alienated so many of the pro-Russian people in the East by destroying their cities
[2:22:09.080 --> 2:22:14.880]  in their artillery barrages that they really had to falsify this latest referendum.
[2:22:14.880 --> 2:22:19.240]  And the purpose of that was, of course, to make the Donbass part of Russian territory
[2:22:19.240 --> 2:22:25.000]  so that they can make good on their threat that if the West now attacks Russian territory,
[2:22:25.000 --> 2:22:27.280]  they will use all the weapons at our disposal.
[2:22:27.280 --> 2:22:31.280]  But he's bluffing in this regard.
[2:22:31.280 --> 2:22:37.080]  As I've explained multiple times in the World Affairs Brief, you cannot use a limited nuclear
[2:22:37.080 --> 2:22:43.960]  strike to blackmail the West into giving up this defense of Ukraine.
[2:22:43.960 --> 2:22:49.480]  If you did that, public reaction in the West would require that the West retaliate, and
[2:22:49.480 --> 2:22:52.600]  Russia would suffer a damaging retaliation.
[2:22:52.600 --> 2:22:57.120]  Now there could be counter-retaliation from the Russians because they have mobile missiles,
[2:22:57.120 --> 2:23:02.680]  which are not in silos, which could not be targeted effectively by the West.
[2:23:02.680 --> 2:23:04.680]  But it would lead to a nuclear confrontation.
[2:23:04.680 --> 2:23:07.280]  And here's the point that I've made.
[2:23:07.280 --> 2:23:12.440]  The purpose of a nuclear confrontation, if done right, is to use all your nuclear weapons
[2:23:12.440 --> 2:23:16.040]  at one time to decapitate the West military.
[2:23:16.040 --> 2:23:20.240]  Now that would take more than 6,000 warheads to do that.
[2:23:20.240 --> 2:23:25.400]  So we're talking about taking all of Russia's missile might to decapitate the West, including
[2:23:25.400 --> 2:23:27.160]  China as well.
[2:23:27.160 --> 2:23:32.400]  But to see Russia itself has shown in the Ukraine war that it doesn't have the military
[2:23:32.400 --> 2:23:38.920]  conventional capacity to occupy even Eastern Ukraine fully, let alone Ukraine, let alone
[2:23:38.920 --> 2:23:40.760]  Europe, let alone the United States.
[2:23:40.760 --> 2:23:47.000]  And so if you nuke a country, and you can't consolidate that gain and occupy, then they
[2:23:47.000 --> 2:23:50.440]  simply rebuild and come back against you, you see.
[2:23:50.440 --> 2:23:55.320]  And so it doesn't do any good to do a limited or even an all-out nuclear strike if you've
[2:23:55.320 --> 2:23:59.920]  got a limited or conventional power.
[2:23:59.920 --> 2:24:05.280]  That's why I've said he has to wait for China to be ready.
[2:24:05.280 --> 2:24:09.040]  And they are in league for China to take down the West, but they've got to wait until
[2:24:09.040 --> 2:24:13.160]  they're ready together, and China isn't ready to take on the West yet.
[2:24:13.160 --> 2:24:15.280]  And so this is a bluff.
[2:24:15.280 --> 2:24:21.960]  Now the West's point of view, the globalist point of view is that they, in fact, are surprised
[2:24:21.960 --> 2:24:26.480]  as everyone that Russia conventional military power showed so much weakness.
[2:24:26.480 --> 2:24:29.520]  In fact, they are completely without reserves now.
[2:24:29.520 --> 2:24:35.600]  It's going to take months to train and get equipped those 300,000 reservists that they're
[2:24:35.600 --> 2:24:40.920]  pulling back in, and the train stations and the airlines are full with people trying to
[2:24:40.920 --> 2:24:41.920]  escape the country.
[2:24:41.920 --> 2:24:46.160]  This is not a popular war.
[2:24:46.160 --> 2:24:51.040]  But the winter is coming on from mid-October through December.
[2:24:51.040 --> 2:24:57.040]  It's going to be a muddy night hold, a mud hole that can't simply operate until it freezes
[2:24:57.040 --> 2:24:58.040]  over.
[2:24:58.040 --> 2:25:02.800]  And even that's a difficult operation with frozen subzero weather there in Ukraine.
[2:25:02.800 --> 2:25:08.000]  So in the meantime, both sides are going to be effectively building up their resources
[2:25:08.000 --> 2:25:11.200]  and getting ready for offenses and counter offenses.
[2:25:11.200 --> 2:25:16.160]  My personal feeling is that Russia is going to be able to only hold eastern Ukraine and
[2:25:16.160 --> 2:25:23.080]  is not going to be able to take southern Ukraine as they had thought, nor any more of Ukraine.
[2:25:23.080 --> 2:25:24.800]  And so it's going to be a stalemate.
[2:25:24.800 --> 2:25:28.360]  Eventually, this is going to be very bad for Russia because they're going to have to withdraw
[2:25:28.360 --> 2:25:30.800]  and it's going to look bad for them.
[2:25:30.800 --> 2:25:37.040]  But the globalist intent, remember, has always been to provoke Russia and China into this
[2:25:37.040 --> 2:25:38.120]  World War III.
[2:25:38.120 --> 2:25:43.000]  They need this World War III to talk Americans into joining a militarized global government.
[2:25:43.000 --> 2:25:46.120]  And I want to talk about that next segment, but let's get to the pipeline.
[2:25:46.120 --> 2:25:48.000]  What's your intel on Nord Stream 2?
[2:25:48.000 --> 2:25:53.760]  They're also reporting in the standard and Bloomberg as of this week that Nord Stream
[2:25:53.760 --> 2:25:58.000]  1 has suddenly all been damaged and leaking and feared to be unusable forever.
[2:25:58.000 --> 2:26:00.760]  I mean, what is that going to do to Europe?
[2:26:00.760 --> 2:26:02.280]  It's separate from Russia.
[2:26:02.280 --> 2:26:07.200]  What is that going to do to Europe when that's like more than half their gas supply?
[2:26:07.200 --> 2:26:11.160]  Well, both Nord Stream 1 and 2 have been hit.
[2:26:11.160 --> 2:26:15.080]  And Nord Stream 1 is the pipeline that is in effect.
[2:26:15.080 --> 2:26:18.040]  And so it is the one that is leaking that you see.
[2:26:18.040 --> 2:26:22.480]  Both pipelines had gas in them, but this was the one that was under pressure.
[2:26:22.480 --> 2:26:26.480]  And so the gas supply to Europe has been completely shut down now.
[2:26:26.480 --> 2:26:32.520]  And it is my belief, Alex, that the Western deep state did this.
[2:26:32.520 --> 2:26:39.120]  First of all, only governments can do those kinds of deep, deep underwater explosives.
[2:26:39.120 --> 2:26:43.600]  And so this either had to be the Russian government or the West, and I think it's the West.
[2:26:43.600 --> 2:26:46.960]  Here's why.
[2:26:46.960 --> 2:26:52.920]  The mood was turning against sanctions in Germany in particularly because of looking for a very
[2:26:52.920 --> 2:26:56.720]  frigid winter without enough gas supplies.
[2:26:56.720 --> 2:27:00.360]  And of course, as you know, Germany shut down their nuclear power plants, their generating
[2:27:00.360 --> 2:27:05.360]  capacity, their natural gas, the generating capacity is not going to be able to provide
[2:27:05.360 --> 2:27:08.600]  electricity and wind and solar power just doesn't cut it.
[2:27:08.600 --> 2:27:13.560]  And so Germany is refusing to bring back online their nuclear power plants.
[2:27:13.560 --> 2:27:15.440]  And so they're in a world of hurt.
[2:27:15.440 --> 2:27:19.320]  And the German people were basically going to demand that the government release the
[2:27:19.320 --> 2:27:20.320]  sanctions.
[2:27:20.320 --> 2:27:21.600]  The globalists didn't want this.
[2:27:21.600 --> 2:27:26.560]  And that's why I think they sabotage the pipeline so that even if so that it it does away with
[2:27:26.560 --> 2:27:31.280]  any German motive to release the sanctions, because it's not going to do any good now.
[2:27:31.280 --> 2:27:33.520]  The gas is not coming back.
[2:27:33.520 --> 2:27:38.080]  Not for many, many months, it will take clear until next year before they could repair those
[2:27:38.080 --> 2:27:39.960]  pipelines, which is very difficult.
[2:27:39.960 --> 2:27:42.480]  I mean, that's my gut level and stay there and elaborate.
[2:27:42.480 --> 2:27:46.840]  But gut level, who stands to gain the Russians don't gain wrote the other day, the Ukrainians
[2:27:46.840 --> 2:27:47.840]  don't even gain.
[2:27:47.840 --> 2:27:51.720]  And you have the CIA saying, oh, we think the Ukrainians are going to do it to German
[2:27:51.720 --> 2:27:54.680]  and EU intelligence a few weeks ago, and that's put out in the news.
[2:27:54.680 --> 2:27:59.080]  But actually the speculating globalist New World Order who want the great reset and have
[2:27:59.080 --> 2:28:04.200]  said they want this and have said they want to force Europe off gas, this the key bono,
[2:28:04.200 --> 2:28:06.480]  this benefits them.
[2:28:06.480 --> 2:28:07.480]  Yes it does.
[2:28:07.480 --> 2:28:12.200]  You know, I've said for many, many years, at least 10 years ago that Europe should not
[2:28:12.200 --> 2:28:17.160]  get beholding to Russia about gas because they can be held hostage, which is what was
[2:28:17.160 --> 2:28:18.160]  happening.
[2:28:18.160 --> 2:28:19.160]  And Trump said that.
[2:28:19.160 --> 2:28:20.160]  That's right.
[2:28:20.160 --> 2:28:27.240]  But the West, in fact, knew that the Germans and the Europeans don't have the guts to
[2:28:27.240 --> 2:28:29.520]  take it and to suffer.
[2:28:29.520 --> 2:28:33.320]  They're going to say release the sanctions and that's why the CIA or the deep state.
[2:28:33.320 --> 2:28:35.560]  That's gone ahead and just blown both pipelines up.
[2:28:35.560 --> 2:28:36.560]  Let's talk about that.
[2:28:36.560 --> 2:28:37.560]  I agree with you.
[2:28:37.560 --> 2:28:39.960]  I said I didn't know the answer, but that's where the evidence leaned.
[2:28:39.960 --> 2:28:41.560]  I wanted to see what you had to say.
[2:28:41.560 --> 2:28:42.760]  Didn't talk to you beforehand.
[2:28:42.760 --> 2:28:46.020]  You just agree with my gut level analysis with all the data.
[2:28:46.020 --> 2:28:47.240]  This is a big deal, folks.
[2:28:47.240 --> 2:28:48.240]  What's this going to do economically?
[2:28:48.240 --> 2:28:49.240]  It's separate from Russia.
[2:28:49.240 --> 2:28:50.240]  Let's talk about it with Joe Scowzen.
[2:28:50.240 --> 2:28:57.400]  When we come back, you'll recap all that, Joe, and you'll have time.
[2:28:57.400 --> 2:29:02.200]  Think about a world without InfoWars.
[2:29:02.200 --> 2:29:06.520]  Just take a moment and sit back and think about all the incredible guests and callers
[2:29:06.520 --> 2:29:11.800]  and stories we've broken together, this family that is InfoWars.
[2:29:11.800 --> 2:29:16.920]  Think about how InfoWars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and Bolsonaro and
[2:29:16.920 --> 2:29:24.400]  other foreign leaders like Nigel Farage as being the main impetus towards firing up their
[2:29:24.400 --> 2:29:27.920]  main base to defeat the New World Order.
[2:29:27.920 --> 2:29:33.680]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today is because the viewers and listeners
[2:29:33.680 --> 2:29:38.160]  of this broadcast have taken action and supported this show.
[2:29:38.160 --> 2:29:39.920]  I don't take the credit.
[2:29:39.920 --> 2:29:44.160]  I give you the credit, and now InfoWars is facing its darkest hours.
[2:29:44.160 --> 2:29:46.120]  It isn't going to give up.

[2:32:56.160 --> 2:32:58.160]  products.
[2:32:58.160 --> 2:33:08.720]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:08.720 --> 2:33:29.040]  Well, I've been saying since the start, I believe Putin walked into a trap, but I agree
[2:33:29.040 --> 2:33:32.440]  with Bill Scowson, the Pentagon and others thought Russia would fight harder or would
[2:33:32.440 --> 2:33:38.040]  have more success, because I know people that are over there right now, and it's like shooting
[2:33:38.040 --> 2:33:42.320]  a fish in a barrel, because the Russians have 20, 30-year-old technology, their military
[2:33:42.320 --> 2:33:47.160]  is not joint forces trained, they're not being coordinated by satellites, they're not in
[2:33:47.160 --> 2:33:51.600]  live time, it's like they're fighting Martians or something, because the CIA, the Pentagon,
[2:33:51.600 --> 2:33:58.000]  the Navy SEALs, the Army Special Operations are there, and it's not like Army Special
[2:33:58.000 --> 2:34:04.320]  Operations is trying to hunt down Islamic operatives or stuff where you can't tell who they are.
[2:34:04.320 --> 2:34:11.080]  This is classical World War II-style military up against a fifth-generational military,
[2:34:11.080 --> 2:34:14.720]  and they're just getting their asses handed to them, and so I'm concerned that Putin will
[2:34:14.720 --> 2:34:20.920]  double down and will do a lot of violent things, and it's just an incredible moment
[2:34:20.920 --> 2:34:21.920]  to be alive.
[2:34:21.920 --> 2:34:25.120]  We're going back to Bill Scowson in a moment, please remember that we're lesser supported
[2:34:25.120 --> 2:34:29.240]  and we're up against the deep state right now, and I've expended almost all of our capital
[2:34:29.240 --> 2:34:34.280]  to stay on air, and please understand that they made a big deal in court last week, oh,
[2:34:34.280 --> 2:34:38.800]  he sells a silver dollar, a collectible coin, marked up three, four times what it's worth.
[2:34:38.800 --> 2:34:41.200]  We never said that we're selling this spot.
[2:34:41.200 --> 2:34:46.840]  It's a collectible, historic coin, Teddy Roosevelt, man in the arena, that is gorgeous that I
[2:34:46.840 --> 2:34:51.640]  designed, only 10,000, half have been sold to keep us on air.
[2:34:51.640 --> 2:34:55.920]  It's a fundraiser, and they insult my intelligence, they insult your intelligence, I thank those
[2:34:55.920 --> 2:34:57.080]  of you that have gotten it.
[2:34:57.080 --> 2:35:00.520]  It's the final coin this year, we've put out four coins, the last three were founding
[2:35:00.520 --> 2:35:04.120]  members, founding members got a discount on it, a bunch of other benefits are coming,
[2:35:04.120 --> 2:35:10.680]  but this is the man in the arena coin, please stand with us in the arena, get it at 1776coin.com,
[2:35:10.680 --> 2:35:16.320]  1776coin.com, or at patriotcollectibles.com, and again, you want to buy the great reset
[2:35:16.320 --> 2:35:21.200]  in the war for the world, number one off and on the last month in the world, you can buy
[2:35:21.200 --> 2:35:26.360]  it for 20 something bucks at info or store, but if you want to pay $99 to get a signed
[2:35:26.360 --> 2:35:30.560]  copy as a fundraiser, you're not having the wool pulled over your eyes like the plaintiffs
[2:35:30.560 --> 2:35:36.280]  lawyers said, it's a fundraiser, just like when PBS or MPR sells a coffee cup for $50
[2:35:36.280 --> 2:35:42.240]  that costs $5, or sells a t-shirt that costs $10 for $100, well this is a coin cost us
[2:35:42.240 --> 2:35:48.960]  30 something bucks, we sell for $100, the point is, it's available at 1776coin.com, the great
[2:35:48.960 --> 2:35:53.920]  reset signed copies or unsigned copies are available at infowarstore.com, and I want to
[2:35:53.920 --> 2:35:59.440]  thank you all for keeping us on the air because we're doing our best work ever right now,
[2:35:59.440 --> 2:36:02.120]  and they are so angry, we're still on air, they are so upset.
[2:36:02.120 --> 2:36:07.000]  All right, going back to Joel Scowles and Joel, fast forwarding to where we are now,
[2:36:07.000 --> 2:36:12.520]  I agree with you that it's a deep state operation, oh Europe, you're about to turn the pipelines
[2:36:12.520 --> 2:36:16.960]  on, you're about to capitulate to Putin, we'll just blow those up for you, separate from
[2:36:16.960 --> 2:36:21.000]  Russia, we can hit that too, what will this do to the economy of the world, they're already
[2:36:21.000 --> 2:36:25.720]  talking about Europe collapsing, a Marshall plan, a universal basic income in Europe and
[2:36:25.720 --> 2:36:30.160]  the UK, where they give you money with programmable tokens, but they tell you how you can spend
[2:36:30.160 --> 2:36:35.560]  it for your gas, for your fuel, I mean it looks like this is a great reset operation,
[2:36:35.560 --> 2:36:36.560]  what do you think?
[2:36:36.560 --> 2:36:41.880]  It is, but the great reset is going to take a lot longer than being instantaneous like
[2:36:41.880 --> 2:36:46.720]  this, first of all remember that Germany is not going to collapse over this pipeline thing,
[2:36:46.720 --> 2:36:53.400]  there is the Norway to Poland pipeline which then can be redistributed into Europe as well,
[2:36:53.400 --> 2:36:56.420]  so they're going to make it through, it's going to be a real hardship, but they're just
[2:36:56.420 --> 2:37:00.080]  foreclosing the sentiment that we need to release the sanctions, they're going to stop
[2:37:00.080 --> 2:37:05.200]  that, and remember this hurts Putin as well, this cuts off the major, what remaining income
[2:37:05.200 --> 2:37:09.800]  stream he was having from the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, and that isn't coming back any
[2:37:09.800 --> 2:37:14.600]  time soon, sure he can market gas to China and other places, but not at the same price,
[2:37:14.600 --> 2:37:22.800]  the elevated price that he was getting for that, the great reset is the real issue, and
[2:37:22.800 --> 2:37:27.480]  there's a war on to be whether or not we're going to get into this AI robotic society
[2:37:27.480 --> 2:37:31.200]  of the great reset and all of the digital currency or whether or not actual physical
[2:37:31.200 --> 2:37:36.440]  war is going to come first, that's the race right now, and the world, the West is heading
[2:37:36.440 --> 2:37:42.000]  headlong toward war and Russia and China are clearly preparing for it, the West is trying
[2:37:42.000 --> 2:37:48.040]  to provoke it, but it's not as if Russia is innocent, he's not innocent, they've always
[2:37:48.040 --> 2:37:52.120]  been intending, that's why they faked their own demise, they're still communist, and believe
[2:37:52.120 --> 2:37:58.600]  me readers, Putin is not a Christian, he's not a Christian, you don't become a KGB colonel
[2:37:58.600 --> 2:38:06.560]  by being a Christian, you don't bomb and artillery destroy cities all over the Ukraine if you're
[2:38:06.560 --> 2:38:12.400]  a Christian, you don't kill innocent people if you do that, and you don't persecute evangelical
[2:38:12.400 --> 2:38:14.400]  Christian sex in Russia.
[2:38:14.400 --> 2:38:20.440]  Sure, just to be clear, no one's saying that everybody's going to die in Europe or that
[2:38:20.440 --> 2:38:24.160]  this is the new war that's about to take over, but they admit, Klaus Schwab admits they're
[2:38:24.160 --> 2:38:29.800]  using this energy cut off and they promised carbon lockdowns by cutting off the power
[2:38:29.800 --> 2:38:35.880]  and clearly that's where they're moving, so they're introducing us to all of this now.
[2:38:35.880 --> 2:38:40.360]  It's true, you know how soon they can do it is still a real question and I don't think
[2:38:40.360 --> 2:38:46.320]  it could be done very, very soon, they are very worried in the European Union about
[2:38:46.320 --> 2:38:51.760]  the anti-globalist sentiment that is building, Sweden for example, just elected a mostly
[2:38:51.760 --> 2:38:55.960]  right-wing president, Italy just elected Georgia, Maloney.
[2:38:55.960 --> 2:38:59.920]  Now she's kind of a suspect, you've got to remember that Maloney, even though she's
[2:38:59.920 --> 2:39:06.120]  saying great things about God, country, family, and religion, etc., she's a member of the
[2:39:06.120 --> 2:39:12.720]  Aspen Institute, which is a globalist organization, she has also voted as a member of parliament,
[2:39:12.720 --> 2:39:19.000]  she voted for the green deal, she voted for all the mandates and COVID restrictions which
[2:39:19.000 --> 2:39:25.520]  were anti-liberty, etc., so you know this is a questionable thing, I'm very skeptical
[2:39:25.520 --> 2:39:29.160]  here that she, in the first place she's not going to be able to change much, Italy's part
[2:39:29.160 --> 2:39:33.160]  of the EU, they control their money, they don't have control of their fiscal policy.
[2:39:33.160 --> 2:39:37.040]  You know, I mean overall I agree, but it's a good sign that in Sweden they're electing
[2:39:37.040 --> 2:39:42.640]  right-wingers, in Canada right-wingers are set to win elections and have gotten conservative,
[2:39:42.640 --> 2:39:47.680]  leadership, they're speaking anti-Claus Schwab, anti-new order, Bolsonaro, all of it, clearly
[2:39:47.680 --> 2:39:52.320]  there is a big populist awakening, that's positive.
[2:39:52.320 --> 2:39:57.040]  It is positive, it is positive, I'm just not sure it's enough, you've got to remember
[2:39:57.040 --> 2:40:01.680]  the deep state in the United States is all powerful, it's just all powerful.
[2:40:01.680 --> 2:40:04.160]  I believe you, I've experienced it.
[2:40:04.160 --> 2:40:09.080]  Yeah, you're up against the judge that prohibited you from using a First Amendment defense of
[2:40:09.080 --> 2:40:10.080]  all things.
[2:40:10.080 --> 2:40:13.280]  I'm going to say I'm innocent, I'm not allowed to point out, I don't even know who these
[2:40:13.280 --> 2:40:16.720]  people are that are suing me, I barely ever even talked about it.
[2:40:16.720 --> 2:40:24.760]  Yeah, but I mean the deep state is very powerful in Europe as well, you know, it's wonderful
[2:40:24.760 --> 2:40:29.760]  that we're having a resistance movement, but in Canada, I'll tell you, they keep electing
[2:40:29.760 --> 2:40:34.400]  this guy Trudeau, Castro's bastard son, and that doesn't speak well for them.
[2:40:34.400 --> 2:40:38.360]  Well, as you know the parliamentary system, you only got like 31% of the vote, they've
[2:40:38.360 --> 2:40:42.240]  used manipulation like Merkel did to stay in.
[2:40:42.240 --> 2:40:45.480]  But when you look at the real conservative votes in the United States, it's probably
[2:40:45.480 --> 2:40:49.440]  less than 20%, you know, remember only half of people in the United States vote.
[2:40:49.440 --> 2:40:56.720]  Well that's my next question, what do you see in 41 days of the midterms?
[2:40:56.720 --> 2:41:00.120]  You know, I don't think that the Republicans are going to, I think we're going to make
[2:41:00.120 --> 2:41:03.920]  gains in the House, I don't think we're going to make gains in the Senate, I think that
[2:41:03.920 --> 2:41:10.160]  Mitch McConnell is sabotaging the GOP's chances by going against the Trump back candidates.
[2:41:10.160 --> 2:41:17.280]  I think Trump to a certain extent is harming the system now, I think DeSantis would be
[2:41:17.280 --> 2:41:22.480]  a better candidate in 2024, but we'll see how that works out, I don't think anybody
[2:41:22.480 --> 2:41:25.080]  can win against Trump if he decides to run.
[2:41:25.080 --> 2:41:28.280]  Well that was my next question, I don't think Trump's a bad guy, I think he means well,
[2:41:28.280 --> 2:41:32.240]  but he has a blind side with this vaccine, I even got folks to talk to him, he just said
[2:41:32.240 --> 2:41:36.240]  nope, I don't care, I don't want to hear from Alex anymore, because he contacted me and
[2:41:36.240 --> 2:41:41.000]  contacted Roger, then I shot a video, he got to Trump and Trump said I don't want to hear
[2:41:41.000 --> 2:41:45.360]  about this again, I'm sticking with this, and so he's so pigheaded, I like the fact
[2:41:45.360 --> 2:41:48.320]  that you like DeSantis, even though he went to Yale, he's not perfect, we should talk
[2:41:48.320 --> 2:41:54.320]  about DeSantis when we come back, but just in a minute, what do you make of Trump?
[2:41:54.320 --> 2:41:58.760]  Well you know, I think Trump has good intentions, he really does want to make America great,
[2:41:58.760 --> 2:42:05.040]  but he doesn't have a clue, he came in, he'd never been a conservative, he knew no conservatives,
[2:42:05.040 --> 2:42:10.800]  paled around with Hillary Clinton, so he didn't know how to pick, he doesn't study conspiracy,
[2:42:10.800 --> 2:42:16.240]  he only lives by briefings, and he doesn't get briefed by any of us, you know, I could
[2:42:16.240 --> 2:42:20.560]  tell him, you know, the deep state created al-Qaeda and ISIS, and it would change his
[2:42:20.560 --> 2:42:25.200]  ability to be influenced by the intelligence community, made a big mistake in killing
[2:42:25.200 --> 2:42:33.480]  Soleimani, who was financing the anti-ISIS and anti-deep state attacks by the Iraqi
[2:42:33.480 --> 2:42:37.600]  militia, he wasn't the biggest sponsor of terror, he was the biggest sponsor of anti-U.S.
[2:42:37.600 --> 2:42:43.040]  terror, I mean this is a very complex world conservative, you've got to really know conspiracy
[2:42:43.040 --> 2:42:45.080]  to understand what's going on in this country.
[2:42:45.080 --> 2:42:48.440]  All right, Bill Scowles in worldoffirstbrief.com, stay there, everybody can go there to the
[2:42:48.440 --> 2:42:51.640]  site, click on the link and a free copy of it, we're going to come back and talk about
[2:42:51.640 --> 2:42:57.280]  the status, talk about the globalist, talk about it all, stay with us.
[2:42:57.280 --> 2:43:02.400]  Look around you, everything I predicted from the globalist documents, from their own admissions
[2:43:02.400 --> 2:43:07.840]  is now happening, info wars credibility, my credibility has never been higher, and it's
[2:43:07.840 --> 2:43:13.120]  because of your backing of this operation that I could steadfastly, despite the censorship
[2:43:13.120 --> 2:43:18.720]  and the boycotts and the attacks and the lawsuits stay on air, but now we're reaching the most
[2:43:18.720 --> 2:43:25.440]  critical juncture in the fight together, so I want to ask all of you today to help keep
[2:43:25.440 --> 2:43:30.600]  me on the air, in my decades on air I've never asked for personal donations, but I'm being
[2:43:30.600 --> 2:43:35.240]  forced by the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees and I can't fund those

[2:46:57.960 --> 2:47:25.920]  Making a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order, it's Alex Jones, and Joel,
[2:47:25.920 --> 2:47:29.120]  I want to do this, I want to throw out some quick points to get your quick answers on
[2:47:29.120 --> 2:47:32.840]  this, I really respect your view, since I was going to ask about the Santas, let's put
[2:47:32.840 --> 2:47:36.320]  him at the end.
[2:47:36.320 --> 2:47:42.520]  Obviously Putin not delivering on the super strongman image he's had is going to damage
[2:47:42.520 --> 2:47:47.760]  him, I see kind of the Russophiles around the world kind of really turning against him
[2:47:47.760 --> 2:47:51.520]  right now, I see that as dangerous, it may make him last shot even stronger, so a minute
[2:47:51.520 --> 2:47:57.800]  or two on Putin, what this does to him, then let's talk about Biden, who is degenerating
[2:47:57.800 --> 2:48:02.920]  super fast, who really is the president, so let's look at Biden, and then let's look
[2:48:02.920 --> 2:48:08.800]  at like you said to Santas and maybe throw in Bolsonaro or anybody else you think is
[2:48:08.800 --> 2:48:09.800]  important.
[2:48:09.800 --> 2:48:13.600]  Well, first of all, you have to understand about Vladimir Putin that he was chosen by
[2:48:13.600 --> 2:48:20.920]  Boris Berezovsky to be president when they ousted Yeltsin the drunk, who was just a place
[2:48:20.920 --> 2:48:25.240]  that our president at the phony fall of the Soviet Union.
[2:48:25.240 --> 2:48:29.480]  Putin met with Berezovsky five times in his Spanish villa the year he ascended to the
[2:48:29.480 --> 2:48:35.440]  presidency, so we know Berezovsky chose him, but Putin eventually took all of the original
[2:48:35.440 --> 2:48:40.040]  oligarchs, who by the way were the hidden communist leaders behind the Politburo who
[2:48:40.040 --> 2:48:44.840]  manufactured this phony fall of the Soviet Union, they came out and had the state bank
[2:48:44.840 --> 2:48:49.360]  give them the funds to be able to buy up gas prom and all of the major oil industry to
[2:48:49.360 --> 2:48:51.320]  make them oligarchs.
[2:48:51.320 --> 2:48:58.120]  Putin ended up killing Berezovsky, assassinating him in London, he exiled Gouzinski and jailed
[2:48:58.120 --> 2:49:03.640]  Horokowski and all the other oligarchs, and so he set up his own younger oligarchs now
[2:49:03.640 --> 2:49:08.600]  who pay him, I've rumored my contacts say about 4% of their income making Putin the
[2:49:08.600 --> 2:49:10.960]  most wealthy person in the world.
[2:49:10.960 --> 2:49:16.040]  But remember, in answering your question, Putin is now a strong man leader, not just
[2:49:16.040 --> 2:49:20.520]  a communist, but a strong man leader like Stalin or Lenin, and he's going to be very
[2:49:20.520 --> 2:49:26.600]  difficult to overthrow, this is not a democracy, he cannot be unelected, he has to be overthrown,
[2:49:26.600 --> 2:49:31.640]  and I'm not sure there's enough power within Russia because the communists are still in
[2:49:31.640 --> 2:49:34.040]  charge and he's their man to overthrow.
[2:49:34.040 --> 2:49:37.040]  Sure, but what about the incredible danger of he was overthrown, who knows what will
[2:49:37.040 --> 2:49:38.760]  come out of that?
[2:49:38.760 --> 2:49:44.080]  Well, that's right, but still you've got to remember the party is still in charge, in
[2:49:44.080 --> 2:49:47.640]  the Kremlin and the halls of the Kremlin, you still have people saying the party says
[2:49:47.640 --> 2:49:54.240]  this, the party says that, so they know that the party still rules, but he's the strong
[2:49:54.240 --> 2:49:58.640]  man leader, he's made himself president for life just like Xi Jinping.
[2:49:58.640 --> 2:50:03.480]  That happens when we're heading for a world war, you have a president for life, I don't
[2:50:03.480 --> 2:50:04.480]  think it's...
[2:50:04.480 --> 2:50:08.240]  Oh yeah, I forgot to bring up Xi Jinping, before we hit the sanis in Biden, Xi Jinping,
[2:50:08.240 --> 2:50:11.680]  all these rumors of coups, people being round up, trains shut down, some of it's true, a
[2:50:11.680 --> 2:50:13.680]  lot of it's not, well what's your intel?
[2:50:13.680 --> 2:50:20.080]  Okay, it's still an unknown, you know, there's a lot of rumors floating around, a lot of
[2:50:20.080 --> 2:50:26.600]  false rumors too, I'm just not sure, I don't think that Xi Jinping has been overthrown,
[2:50:26.600 --> 2:50:30.080]  that's my gut feeling right now, but we'll have to see.
[2:50:30.080 --> 2:50:33.680]  I agree with you, okay, let's look at Biden in the midterms, I mean he is degenerating,
[2:50:33.680 --> 2:50:37.600]  I don't know if you've been watching, but he literally like from a week ago, he's much
[2:50:37.600 --> 2:50:42.600]  worse, he's on vacation 60% of the time, what are they going to do about that, 25th amendment,
[2:50:42.600 --> 2:50:45.520]  what's going to happen?
[2:50:45.520 --> 2:50:50.280]  Well I've been waiting for someone to come in and announce that Biden is retiring and
[2:50:50.280 --> 2:50:55.200]  getting out of the way, he can't keep going like this, his mind just isn't holding up,
[2:50:55.200 --> 2:50:59.520]  you know, I think the problem is they don't have anyone that is willing to replace him
[2:50:59.520 --> 2:51:05.360]  yet, this is a really touchy situation with this great reset going on, this build back
[2:51:05.360 --> 2:51:10.560]  better, and this inflationary situation, who wants to own that, which of the Democrats
[2:51:10.560 --> 2:51:14.880]  want to own that, that's the problem within the party, that's one of the reasons they
[2:51:14.880 --> 2:51:20.720]  put Biden in is because he's dispensable, he can get away, he's disposable, I mean when
[2:51:20.720 --> 2:51:25.280]  in this gets so unpopular, they can remove Biden and play like it's going away, but they're
[2:51:25.280 --> 2:51:30.520]  going to have to have somebody, and I'm not counting out Hillary Clinton yet, you know,
[2:51:30.520 --> 2:51:34.720]  somebody as smart as her is capable of coming in and claiming to be a moderate to moderate
[2:51:34.720 --> 2:51:40.440]  these policies, but Biden is not in my opinion going to be running for president in 2024.
[2:51:40.440 --> 2:51:45.160]  I think we're going to see a Republican landslide, except there's going to be massive election
[2:51:45.160 --> 2:51:46.160]  fraud again.
[2:51:46.160 --> 2:51:53.040]  Yeah, there would be a massive landslide if it were not election fraud, but believe
[2:51:53.040 --> 2:51:55.600]  me, I don't think they're going to let the Republicans.
[2:51:55.600 --> 2:51:58.760]  Oh yeah, they're not going to stop now, they already got away with it, I agree, I think
[2:51:58.760 --> 2:52:00.000]  it'll be worse.
[2:52:00.000 --> 2:52:01.000]  What about the Santas?
[2:52:01.000 --> 2:52:05.840]  I gut level like the Santas, but I have a lot of questions, but everything he says seems
[2:52:05.840 --> 2:52:09.560]  to be really good, I get a good feeling, I want to just operate off that, what do you
[2:52:09.560 --> 2:52:10.560]  think of the Santas?
[2:52:10.560 --> 2:52:15.400]  Well, I get, I feel the same way, Alex, I like the Santas, what he's saying, but you've
[2:52:15.400 --> 2:52:20.720]  got to be cautious in the fact that the Santas doesn't know anything about conspiracy either.
[2:52:20.720 --> 2:52:22.240]  And so, you know, he's a smart guy.
[2:52:22.240 --> 2:52:24.960]  But it seems to be a quick study.
[2:52:24.960 --> 2:52:25.960]  That's right.
[2:52:25.960 --> 2:52:29.600]  If he got the right advisors around him, if I had four hours with him, I could set him
[2:52:29.600 --> 2:52:32.800]  straight and help him understand what the deep state is doing.
[2:52:32.800 --> 2:52:34.600]  And by the way, people don't know about you.
[2:52:34.600 --> 2:52:38.800]  You weren't just an Air Force officer, you weren't just an able aviator in Vietnam.
[2:52:38.800 --> 2:52:43.680]  You led the main conservative coalition that they hate so much that almost took the country
[2:52:43.680 --> 2:52:44.680]  back with Reagan.
[2:52:44.680 --> 2:52:47.240]  So it's not like you're just speaking out of turn here.
[2:52:47.240 --> 2:52:48.640]  Yeah, that's right.
[2:52:48.640 --> 2:52:52.920]  But in any case, you know, Trump is literally inaccessible.
[2:52:52.920 --> 2:52:55.960]  If you're not part of his inner crowd, you just can't get to him.
[2:52:55.960 --> 2:52:58.440]  And so he's unteachable in that regard.
[2:52:58.440 --> 2:52:59.440]  That's what I mean.
[2:52:59.440 --> 2:53:02.160]  And he wants to be told what he wants to be told.
[2:53:02.160 --> 2:53:05.680]  Trump doesn't like having conversations with me because I argue with him.
[2:53:05.680 --> 2:53:06.680]  That's right.
[2:53:06.680 --> 2:53:07.680]  He doesn't like to be argued.
[2:53:07.680 --> 2:53:11.680]  He wants to be briefed and, you know, he may disagree with their briefers, but he doesn't
[2:53:11.680 --> 2:53:16.640]  have the argumentative background to be able to back his gut intuition.
[2:53:16.640 --> 2:53:20.880]  When he correctly said we ought to do away with birthright citizenship, they tucked him
[2:53:20.880 --> 2:53:24.000]  out of it in five minutes and he didn't have the arguments to do that.
[2:53:24.000 --> 2:53:27.800]  His gut was, these vaccines are dangerous, but he has a two hour minimum bill gates
[2:53:27.800 --> 2:53:29.800]  and reverses course.
[2:53:29.800 --> 2:53:30.960]  Yeah.
[2:53:30.960 --> 2:53:35.280]  So as I say, I think DeSantis would be more workable.
[2:53:35.280 --> 2:53:39.120]  You know, the establishment hates DeSantis and they're trying to get him out in Texas
[2:53:39.120 --> 2:53:45.400]  and put in Charlie Chris, the gay, you know, governor in there.
[2:53:45.400 --> 2:53:48.920]  You know that DeSantis is probably on the right track because the establishment is so
[2:53:48.920 --> 2:53:49.920]  deeply against him.
[2:53:49.920 --> 2:53:52.160]  Notice in George W. Bush was president.
[2:53:52.160 --> 2:53:55.560]  They never came out strongly against Bush on anything.
[2:53:55.560 --> 2:53:56.560]  Sure.
[2:53:56.560 --> 2:53:58.060]  Let me ask a selfish question.
[2:53:58.060 --> 2:53:59.560]  Why do they hate me so much?
[2:53:59.560 --> 2:54:05.160]  I mean, they, they literally see with hate thousands of articles a day every day.
[2:54:05.160 --> 2:54:07.640]  It's just totalize.
[2:54:07.640 --> 2:54:08.640]  What have I done?
[2:54:08.640 --> 2:54:13.240]  I mean, I'm not, well, it's your effectiveness, Alex.
[2:54:13.240 --> 2:54:19.720]  You've got the biggest audience in the entire hard right conservative movement and it's
[2:54:19.720 --> 2:54:20.920]  impressive to them.
[2:54:20.920 --> 2:54:22.280]  They fear the truth.
[2:54:22.280 --> 2:54:23.280]  That's the problem.
[2:54:23.280 --> 2:54:27.720]  I mean, that's why they've even refused to put your great reset book, which is bestseller
[2:54:27.720 --> 2:54:28.960]  status on the New York Times.
[2:54:28.960 --> 2:54:34.080]  They refused to put it on because, you know, it would get people to read it and that's
[2:54:34.080 --> 2:54:36.800]  why they won't exceed to it.
[2:54:36.800 --> 2:54:39.640]  Do you have any advice for me because I'm in the darkest point of my life?
[2:54:39.640 --> 2:54:40.840]  It's also the most positive.
[2:54:40.840 --> 2:54:42.760]  I mean, I'm being persecuted because I've been good.
[2:54:42.760 --> 2:54:43.760]  I'm trying to be good.
[2:54:43.760 --> 2:54:45.960]  I'm trying to pray more, to be close to God.
[2:54:45.960 --> 2:54:46.960]  But what is your advice?
[2:54:46.960 --> 2:54:49.960]  Because I respect you, Joel, about what I should do right now, what I should be saying
[2:54:49.960 --> 2:54:53.000]  and what the audience should be doing.
[2:54:53.000 --> 2:54:57.600]  Just be more careful in what I'm saying is so that they can't find anything to pick.
[2:54:57.600 --> 2:55:01.920]  I mean, I've reviewed the tapes about, you know, the Sandy Hook thinking it was just
[2:55:01.920 --> 2:55:08.000]  a very brief minute when you bought into that thing about Robbie Parker and the others.
[2:55:08.000 --> 2:55:13.560]  And you know, I'm a real believer in conscience that it warns us when we're dealing with a
[2:55:13.560 --> 2:55:14.560]  little bit of...
[2:55:14.560 --> 2:55:18.440]  My mother called up when Steve Pachinick was on six years ago saying, no Alex at stage
[2:55:18.440 --> 2:55:19.440]  and I'm not trying to attack Steve.
[2:55:19.440 --> 2:55:20.440]  He won't come on.
[2:55:20.440 --> 2:55:21.440]  High level CIA.
[2:55:21.440 --> 2:55:23.480]  She said, that guy's with the bushes.
[2:55:23.480 --> 2:55:26.680]  You better get off the Sandy Hook thing long before they sued me.
[2:55:26.680 --> 2:55:30.120]  And my mom said, you're being set up with Sandy Hook and I'm just like, I barely even
[2:55:30.120 --> 2:55:31.120]  talked about it.
[2:55:31.120 --> 2:55:32.120]  I'm going to get off.
[2:55:32.120 --> 2:55:34.880]  But my mother's conscience, her gut was right.
[2:55:34.880 --> 2:55:35.880]  That's right.
[2:55:35.880 --> 2:55:39.600]  And you know, all of us in the conservative movement need to really listen more closely
[2:55:39.600 --> 2:55:43.640]  to conscience, not only about the spiritual things and about our temporal eyes.
[2:55:43.640 --> 2:55:44.680]  We need to lose weight.
[2:55:44.680 --> 2:55:46.760]  We need to be stronger mentally.
[2:55:46.760 --> 2:55:47.760]  We need to study.
[2:55:47.760 --> 2:55:49.320]  We need to get off the junk food.
[2:55:49.320 --> 2:55:52.920]  I mean, if we're going to survive this, here's my basic point that I want to make.
[2:55:52.920 --> 2:55:56.440]  You know, the big problem with Trump that I see is people think he's going to save us
[2:55:56.440 --> 2:55:58.320]  and we don't have to prepare.
[2:55:58.320 --> 2:56:03.480]  I'm telling you, Alex, that nobody is going to defeat this deep state.
[2:56:03.480 --> 2:56:05.720]  It's too deeply entrenched.
[2:56:05.720 --> 2:56:07.400]  That doesn't mean we don't stop fighting.
[2:56:07.400 --> 2:56:08.880]  We need to elect good people.
[2:56:08.880 --> 2:56:14.000]  We need to fight back because it teaches, it converts people to become the remnant that
[2:56:14.000 --> 2:56:19.480]  we need to survive when we have to go back to our rural roots, but someday everybody's
[2:56:19.480 --> 2:56:21.680]  going to have to leave the big cities, which are going to be ours.
[2:56:21.680 --> 2:56:26.160]  And by the way, my conscience, my spirit just orders me to go rural now.
[2:56:26.160 --> 2:56:30.320]  It's like every 10 seconds, get out of the city, get out of the city, get out of the
[2:56:30.320 --> 2:56:31.320]  city.
[2:56:31.320 --> 2:56:35.760]  And the reason is because when this either a great reset or the war comes, the supply
[2:56:35.760 --> 2:56:39.920]  chain is going to just literally disappear and you're not going to be able to.
[2:56:39.920 --> 2:56:41.160]  And that was my last question.
[2:56:41.160 --> 2:56:43.680]  Do five more minutes, but do it now, a minute now.
[2:56:43.680 --> 2:56:48.240]  Supply chain, how bad is it?
[2:56:48.240 --> 2:56:52.240]  It's actually recovering in some areas and getting worse in some areas, but they intend
[2:56:52.240 --> 2:56:54.560]  to sabotage it more completely.
[2:56:54.560 --> 2:56:59.240]  It's never going to get very good coupled with inflation, which really makes it very,
[2:56:59.240 --> 2:57:00.240]  very difficult.
[2:57:00.240 --> 2:57:03.120]  That's exactly what we've seen as big manufacturers.
[2:57:03.120 --> 2:57:06.480]  It got devastated, came back a little, but it's all screwed up.
[2:57:06.480 --> 2:57:07.480]  Yeah.
[2:57:07.480 --> 2:57:09.000]  And it's never going to get any better.
[2:57:09.000 --> 2:57:12.200]  The hurricane, everything else is going to play into this.
[2:57:12.200 --> 2:57:16.880]  But what I'm saying is this, if you're waiting for good times to come back and get property
[2:57:16.880 --> 2:57:22.080]  and to buy your survival gears and buy solar and buy generators and things, don't wait.
[2:57:22.080 --> 2:57:25.040]  You've got to do it now because things are just going to get worse.
[2:57:25.040 --> 2:57:27.920]  We are never going back to good times in the United States.
[2:57:27.920 --> 2:57:30.400]  Well, even McCron said that.
[2:57:30.400 --> 2:57:31.720]  He said it's never going back.
[2:57:31.720 --> 2:57:33.240]  The good times are over.
[2:57:33.240 --> 2:57:34.240]  Yeah.
[2:57:34.240 --> 2:57:38.280]  Of course, he's part of the conspiracy to make sure it doesn't get, oh, exactly.
[2:57:38.280 --> 2:57:39.280]  All right.
[2:57:39.280 --> 2:57:40.280]  We'll do a few more minutes.
[2:57:40.280 --> 2:57:41.280]  We got one caller we're going to take.
[2:57:41.280 --> 2:57:42.280]  Charlie and we come back.
[2:57:42.280 --> 2:57:47.440]  Stay with us.
[2:57:47.440 --> 2:57:52.240]  Think about a world without InfoWars.
[2:57:52.240 --> 2:57:56.560]  Just take a moment and sit back and think about all the incredible guests and callers
[2:57:56.560 --> 2:58:01.880]  and stories we've broken together, this family that is InfoWars.
[2:58:01.880 --> 2:58:07.200]  Think about how InfoWars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and Ball Sonaro and other
[2:58:07.200 --> 2:58:14.760]  foreign leaders like Nigel Farage as being the main impetus towards firing up their main
[2:58:14.760 --> 2:58:17.960]  base to defeat the New World Order.
[2:58:17.960 --> 2:58:23.720]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today is because the viewers and listeners
[2:58:23.720 --> 2:58:28.200]  of this broadcast have taken action and supported this show.
[2:58:28.200 --> 2:58:29.960]  I don't take the credit.
[2:58:29.960 --> 2:58:31.800]  I give you the credit.
[2:58:31.800 --> 2:58:34.160]  And now InfoWars is facing its darkest hours.
[2:58:34.160 --> 2:58:36.200]  It isn't going to give up.
[2:58:36.200 --> 2:58:37.960]  Without your support, we can be shut down.
[2:58:37.960 --> 2:58:41.360]  Please go to saveinfowars.com today.
[2:58:41.360 --> 2:58:47.200]  And donate for our Legal Defense Fund.
[2:58:47.200 --> 2:58:53.320]  By the will of God and by God working through you and your support, InfoWars continues to
[2:58:53.320 --> 2:58:58.160]  persevere against the attacks never before seen in the Western world against independent
[2:58:58.160 --> 2:58:59.160]  media.
[2:58:59.160 --> 2:59:00.160]  Thanks for keeping me in the fight.
[2:59:00.160 --> 2:59:02.480]  And over the years, you have come to the table.
[2:59:02.480 --> 2:59:07.240]  You have stepped to the plate so many times and kept InfoWars and free speech on the air.
[2:59:07.240 --> 2:59:08.240]  And I thank you.
[2:59:08.240 --> 2:59:12.480]  But now I have my own legal bills that have reached the point that I can't pay them.
[2:59:12.480 --> 2:59:13.480]  And I need your support.
[2:59:13.480 --> 2:59:18.360]  So if you want to keep this operation moving forward, if you want to back me in this fight
[2:59:18.360 --> 2:59:23.360]  against the globalist, please visit saveinfowars.com.

[2:59:29.760 --> 2:59:30.760]  Fund.
[2:59:30.760 --> 2:59:34.920]  This whole phase of their attacks, four years in the making, is almost over.
[2:59:34.920 --> 2:59:39.160]  And right at the end, we're not giving up, we're not giving in, but we could give out.
[2:59:39.160 --> 2:59:42.800]  So please, if you support what we're doing and want to fight for liberty and freedom
[2:59:42.800 --> 2:59:48.680]  and just in the future, go to saveinfowars.com today.
[2:59:48.680 --> 3:00:06.640]  We're leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[3:00:06.640 --> 3:00:13.680]  It's Alex Jones.
[3:00:13.680 --> 3:00:19.360]  Dali's got a big guest coming up in the fourth hour, look forward to seeing and hearing that.
[3:00:19.360 --> 3:00:22.960]  He'll be sure to stay with us on short in one hour with the War Room.
[3:00:22.960 --> 3:00:25.120]  Joe Scowles, I wanted to cram one call in here.
[3:00:25.120 --> 3:00:29.240]  I wasn't trying to bash Steve Pachennick earlier, I was just saying what my mom said.
[3:00:29.240 --> 3:00:32.840]  We got, now Steve won't come on the show for whatever reason, but we've got Charlene and
[3:00:32.840 --> 3:00:33.840]  Pennsylvania.
[3:00:33.840 --> 3:00:34.840]  Quick comment on Steve Pachennick.
[3:00:34.840 --> 3:00:35.840]  I have no idea what it is.
[3:00:35.840 --> 3:00:36.840]  Go ahead, Charlene.
[3:00:36.840 --> 3:00:37.840]  Where is he?
[3:00:37.840 --> 3:00:38.840]  Where is Steve Pachennick?
[3:00:38.840 --> 3:00:39.840]  He's not posting new videos.
[3:00:39.840 --> 3:00:47.040]  He's not on his blog or his Twitter or his Facebook page.
[3:00:47.040 --> 3:00:49.040]  What's happening with him?
[3:00:49.040 --> 3:00:50.040]  I don't know.
[3:00:50.040 --> 3:00:53.040]  I mean, I've invited him on the show and I'm not trying to bash him.
[3:00:53.040 --> 3:00:56.560]  He was just the fungal guy that said, no, Alex, it was stage.
[3:00:56.560 --> 3:00:57.560]  You're doing the right thing.
[3:00:57.560 --> 3:00:58.560]  Say Sandy Hook stage.
[3:00:58.560 --> 3:01:02.200]  And I just wanted him to come on, not about Sandy Hook, but about any of these issues.
[3:01:02.200 --> 3:01:04.480]  Charlene, you got any questions for Joe Scowles?
[3:01:04.480 --> 3:01:05.480]  No, he's excellent.
[3:01:05.480 --> 3:01:06.480]  He's awesome.
[3:01:06.480 --> 3:01:10.720]  He's more intelligent than me in politics.
[3:01:10.720 --> 3:01:12.320]  We're all smart here in one way or another.
[3:01:12.320 --> 3:01:13.320]  All right.
[3:01:13.320 --> 3:01:14.320]  God bless you, Charlene.
[3:01:14.320 --> 3:01:15.320]  Thanks for the call.
[3:01:15.320 --> 3:01:19.080]  In closing here at Joe Scowles and World Affairs Brief.com, what other key items would you like
[3:01:19.080 --> 3:01:21.040]  to add to the viewers and listeners?
[3:01:21.040 --> 3:01:25.440]  Well, you know, it's hard for me to cover everything I do in the World Affairs Brief
[3:01:25.440 --> 3:01:29.760]  every Friday, which I cover the news from the aspect of what the deep state is doing
[3:01:29.760 --> 3:01:30.760]  to us.
[3:01:30.760 --> 3:01:36.440]  And your listeners can get a free sample copy by going to worldaffairsbrief.com and
[3:01:36.440 --> 3:01:43.680]  click on request the sample on the left-hand side and be happy to see all of you on Friday
[3:01:43.680 --> 3:01:48.520]  when I talk about this pipeline and some of the details here we haven't been able to mention
[3:01:48.520 --> 3:01:49.520]  on the show.
[3:01:49.520 --> 3:01:50.520]  All right.
[3:01:50.520 --> 3:01:51.520]  Well, here's my final question then.
[3:01:51.520 --> 3:01:54.920]  The thing I was forgetting, you're in the strategic relocation.
[3:01:54.920 --> 3:01:56.920]  You build some of the most, you know, secure homes out there.
[3:01:56.920 --> 3:01:59.800]  You're the guy that wrote the best selling book on secure homes.
[3:01:59.800 --> 3:02:04.080]  Even mainstream news admits the rich are fleeing to bunkers, fleeing to the southern hemisphere.
[3:02:04.080 --> 3:02:06.080]  Why are they doing that?
[3:02:06.080 --> 3:02:11.240]  Well, they know that a war is coming and they're stupid enough to be going to New Zealand and
[3:02:11.240 --> 3:02:15.600]  Australia and southern hemisphere where it's going to be taken over by China and they
[3:02:15.600 --> 3:02:16.760]  don't understand that.
[3:02:16.760 --> 3:02:20.800]  It's really interesting that the people involved in the deep state at the lower levels are
[3:02:20.800 --> 3:02:25.040]  not being told what's being planned at the highest levels.
[3:02:25.040 --> 3:02:29.000]  A lot of them don't know that they know that something bad is going to happen, but they
[3:02:29.000 --> 3:02:30.680]  aren't being given much guidance.
[3:02:30.680 --> 3:02:33.880]  But you can get a lot of guidance by reading strategic relocation.
[3:02:33.880 --> 3:02:38.440]  Listen, you need to stay in the United States, the other countries that the expats are fleeing
[3:02:38.440 --> 3:02:40.360]  to now look good on paper right now.
[3:02:40.360 --> 3:02:44.160]  But I explained in the book why they're not going to be good at all when war comes.
[3:02:44.160 --> 3:02:46.120]  And you've always said that for decades.
[3:02:46.120 --> 3:02:47.600]  Now you're vindicated.
[3:02:47.600 --> 3:02:50.840]  Look how we were the best house in the bad neighborhood during the COVID lockdowns and
[3:02:50.840 --> 3:02:51.840]  tyranny.
[3:02:51.840 --> 3:02:53.640]  We were still the best place to be.
[3:02:53.640 --> 3:02:54.640]  That's right.
[3:02:54.640 --> 3:02:58.480]  South America wouldn't even let Americans leave the country, let alone, you know, had to.
[3:02:58.480 --> 3:02:59.480]  So tell us.
[3:02:59.480 --> 3:03:00.480]  Some people should read the book at enforce.com.
[3:03:00.480 --> 3:03:04.680]  They should watch the film enforce where I come, but just in a minute and a half.
[3:03:04.680 --> 3:03:08.200]  Where are just top five best places to live right now?
[3:03:08.200 --> 3:03:14.200]  Well, I used to say that Canada was a good place, an escape place for Americans, but
[3:03:14.200 --> 3:03:15.200]  that's no longer true.
[3:03:15.200 --> 3:03:19.480]  In fact, I'm telling Canadians get out of the country because it's going downhill fast
[3:03:19.480 --> 3:03:21.000]  with that globalist president.
[3:03:21.000 --> 3:03:24.360]  And it's not going to change if he is voted out of office.
[3:03:24.360 --> 3:03:29.760]  But in the United States, the best areas are from in the Midwest from Missouri on out to
[3:03:29.760 --> 3:03:36.480]  the, to the Intermountain West, Montana, Utah, Idaho, Northern Arizona.
[3:03:36.480 --> 3:03:39.040]  I used to include Colorado, but it's a blue state now.
[3:03:39.040 --> 3:03:42.080]  You don't want to move to a blue state because they're going to take all of your gun rights
[3:03:42.080 --> 3:03:48.120]  away and make it impossible for you to discriminate and make religious choices, et cetera.
[3:03:48.120 --> 3:03:52.360]  But right now the Intermountain West is still too expensive because of all the Californians
[3:03:52.360 --> 3:03:54.760]  that moved out to Utah and Idaho.
[3:03:54.760 --> 3:03:59.800]  And so right now Missouri is probably one of the top states to go to in terms of to stay
[3:03:59.800 --> 3:04:05.560]  away from the St. Louis area by a long shot, but rural Missouri still got a lot of good
[3:04:05.560 --> 3:04:09.920]  areas and fairly cheap land, which you can't say for the rest of the United States.
[3:04:09.920 --> 3:04:13.360]  If you've got to stay in Texas, where would you be?
[3:04:13.360 --> 3:04:21.160]  Well, you want to get into the area west of Dallas, Fort Worth area is still green enough.
[3:04:21.160 --> 3:04:26.560]  It's not into the dry far west Texas area, which has just got no water, but it's got
[3:04:26.560 --> 3:04:28.200]  good ranch land, et cetera.
[3:04:28.200 --> 3:04:33.640]  So I would go stay about 50 to 70 miles away from Dallas, Fort Worth and go over.
[3:04:33.640 --> 3:04:34.640]  It's funny you say that.
[3:04:34.640 --> 3:04:38.800]  I know a bunch of really rich people, very well known folks, and they're all moving to
[3:04:38.800 --> 3:04:45.040]  places like Weatherford, 30, 40, 50 miles outside of Fort Worth, 60, 70 miles from Dallas.
[3:04:45.040 --> 3:04:47.080]  That's where all the money's going.
[3:04:47.080 --> 3:04:48.080]  That's right.
[3:04:48.080 --> 3:04:49.080]  Yeah.
[3:04:49.080 --> 3:04:50.320]  And crazy, you know that, Joel.
[3:04:50.320 --> 3:04:51.320]  They're always impressive.
[3:04:51.320 --> 3:04:52.320]  Thank you so much.

[3:08:19.600 --> 3:08:20.600]  about you.
[3:08:20.600 --> 3:08:25.240]  You're actually a physician, you know, financial strategist, American trader, you kind of do
[3:08:25.240 --> 3:08:26.240]  it all.
[3:08:26.240 --> 3:08:29.360]  And I love that about you because you come from a lot of different walks of life and
[3:08:29.360 --> 3:08:31.000]  I think it's very, very cool.
[3:08:31.000 --> 3:08:32.000]  Welcome to the show.
[3:08:32.000 --> 3:08:33.000]  Greg, how are you?
[3:08:33.000 --> 3:08:37.840]  Thanks for having me, it's been a long time, I appreciate it and let's have some fun with
[3:08:37.840 --> 3:08:38.840]  this.
[3:08:38.840 --> 3:08:39.840]  Oh, absolutely.
[3:08:39.840 --> 3:08:43.480]  So you were talking today, you released a video today, by the way, you have to check
[3:08:43.480 --> 3:08:48.600]  out his YouTube channel, Greg Manorino, you're going to get the wildest updates and they
[3:08:48.600 --> 3:08:55.080]  are amazingly, let me just say this, your audience loves you because of your accuracy.
[3:08:55.080 --> 3:08:59.360]  So let's hear about the Bank of England first because you dropped a very, very explosive
[3:08:59.360 --> 3:09:00.360]  video today.
[3:09:00.360 --> 3:09:03.640]  Yeah, well, here's the deal.
[3:09:03.640 --> 3:09:10.080]  I've been saying now for months, literally no, weeks that we have a big issue here.
[3:09:10.080 --> 3:09:15.200]  And it's, you know, the people are fixated on this, the stock market, okay, it's all
[3:09:15.200 --> 3:09:16.640]  well and good.
[3:09:16.640 --> 3:09:23.000]  But the issue here is, is the driver and that is the global debt market, which is a ticking
[3:09:23.000 --> 3:09:27.840]  time bomb, it's the greatest threat to human life, people understand how big this is.
[3:09:27.840 --> 3:09:31.680]  Forget about global warming, whatever it may be, real or not.
[3:09:31.680 --> 3:09:34.200]  Forget about nuclear war threats, real or not.
[3:09:34.200 --> 3:09:36.800]  This is a clear and present danger.
[3:09:36.800 --> 3:09:43.280]  The debt market here, the global financial system is at risk today.
[3:09:43.280 --> 3:09:48.800]  And the action that was taken by the Bank of England here for another round of quantitative
[3:09:48.800 --> 3:09:52.960]  easing, if to all we've been hearing, our central banks are going to tighten monetary
[3:09:52.960 --> 3:09:57.440]  policy, they're going to do this, that and the other thing, look, this whole system
[3:09:57.440 --> 3:10:02.720]  is so twisted and so perverted, I've been selling saying that if unless central banks
[3:10:02.720 --> 3:10:09.160]  take action, like now, you know, this thing was on the verge of imploding and implosion
[3:10:09.160 --> 3:10:13.960]  in the debt market again, is the greatest threat to human life and existence on the
[3:10:13.960 --> 3:10:15.720]  planet today.
[3:10:15.720 --> 3:10:22.080]  This will lead to a resource problem, a shutdown of the entire global financial system, a locking
[3:10:22.080 --> 3:10:26.800]  up of the system, people are going to take to the streets, finally, like they should
[3:10:26.800 --> 3:10:30.200]  already be doing with all the corruption that's going on here.
[3:10:30.200 --> 3:10:31.480]  But that this is it.
[3:10:31.480 --> 3:10:37.080]  This thing with Bank of England is humongous and it's getting, it's finally getting some
[3:10:37.080 --> 3:10:42.520]  freaking airplay on the mainstream channels, which, you know, look, you know how that works.
[3:10:42.520 --> 3:10:45.480]  They never want anyone to know what's really going on.
[3:10:45.480 --> 3:10:50.360]  It's all deceptions, it's distractions, it's look here, don't look here.
[3:10:50.360 --> 3:10:53.720]  You know, I've been warning people about this for years.
[3:10:53.720 --> 3:10:58.600]  And finally, to see it getting some attention really, I think is an eye opener.
[3:10:58.600 --> 3:11:00.000]  Absolutely.
[3:11:00.000 --> 3:11:03.240]  I don't think people realize the role that they play, do you?
[3:11:03.240 --> 3:11:04.240]  No.
[3:11:04.240 --> 3:11:05.240]  Not at all.
[3:11:05.240 --> 3:11:11.280]  The whole system is designed to keep people, you know, in some kind of a state that they
[3:11:11.280 --> 3:11:14.560]  have no idea what's going on, they don't know what they're doing, they don't know why they're
[3:11:14.560 --> 3:11:15.560]  doing it.
[3:11:15.560 --> 3:11:18.880]  You know, and this is not just a phenomenon here in the United States.
[3:11:18.880 --> 3:11:22.120]  This is something that's been going on all over the world.
[3:11:22.120 --> 3:11:30.720]  People are being kept, you know, deceptively out of the know, told to be, you know, focusing
[3:11:30.720 --> 3:11:34.400]  on one nonsensical thing while other things are going on in the background.
[3:11:34.400 --> 3:11:40.040]  It's a story that has been going on since forever here, how those that really hold the
[3:11:40.040 --> 3:11:48.720]  power are able to keep it by keeping people in some kind of dumbed down, zombified state.
[3:11:48.720 --> 3:11:49.920]  And this is how they get away with it.
[3:11:49.920 --> 3:11:55.280]  You know, the masses of people, they have no clue as to what's actually going on.
[3:11:55.280 --> 3:11:57.520]  Thank goodness for shows like yours.
[3:11:57.520 --> 3:12:00.520]  People can hear the truth and maybe make some sense of it.
[3:12:00.520 --> 3:12:02.760]  I mean, we got to get this stuff out there.
[3:12:02.760 --> 3:12:04.720]  It's just too big.
[3:12:04.720 --> 3:12:05.720]  It's so true.
[3:12:05.720 --> 3:12:08.760]  My guest, Greg Manorino, Robin Hood of Wall Street.
[3:12:08.760 --> 3:12:12.720]  And so we hit on Bank of England, which I don't think people, it isn't talked about.
[3:12:12.720 --> 3:12:13.720]  You're absolutely right.
[3:12:13.720 --> 3:12:15.000]  What about central banks?
[3:12:15.000 --> 3:12:18.800]  Now our central banks are, I love that they call it, what they call it.
[3:12:18.800 --> 3:12:21.360]  It's not federal nor it's a reserve in any way.
[3:12:21.360 --> 3:12:26.400]  But the central banks, let's talk about the central banks too, playing into this as well.
[3:12:26.400 --> 3:12:31.040]  Central banks, look, who controls the global financial system?
[3:12:31.040 --> 3:12:34.080]  Who controls the global economy?
[3:12:34.080 --> 3:12:37.400]  Who controls literally the freaking world?
[3:12:37.400 --> 3:12:39.640]  It's central banks.
[3:12:39.640 --> 3:12:41.600]  They control everything.
[3:12:41.600 --> 3:12:45.120]  They are in full command here.
[3:12:45.120 --> 3:12:51.440]  Everything else is a theater, it's a side act, it's a show, period of the end.
[3:12:51.440 --> 3:12:54.480]  They dictate the rules because they control the money.
[3:12:54.480 --> 3:12:55.840]  They control the economy.
[3:12:55.840 --> 3:12:57.800]  They control the financial system.
[3:12:57.800 --> 3:12:59.920]  And they are working towards an end game.
[3:12:59.920 --> 3:13:04.960]  Look, central banks here, in my view, and I've been telling people this for years, this
[3:13:04.960 --> 3:13:06.120]  is the enemy.
[3:13:06.120 --> 3:13:09.760]  This is public enemy number one, bar none.
[3:13:09.760 --> 3:13:13.120]  And they are out to destroy the global economy.
[3:13:13.120 --> 3:13:16.480]  They're out to destroy the global financial system.
[3:13:16.480 --> 3:13:26.360]  So as they work in concert to bring about a new world order, a central bank controlled
[3:13:26.360 --> 3:13:30.720]  one world system, which we already have here, like I was just saying, the rest of it is
[3:13:30.720 --> 3:13:32.960]  just a side act.
[3:13:32.960 --> 3:13:35.760]  And they are determined to do two things.
[3:13:35.760 --> 3:13:41.680]  Well, one, if you wrap it up, to be the lenders and buyers of a last resort here, to bring
[3:13:41.680 --> 3:13:50.000]  about a decrease in the global population by bringing the financial system to its knees.
[3:13:50.000 --> 3:13:56.040]  They are eliminating an entire class of people on a global level.
[3:13:56.040 --> 3:14:00.600]  The middle class is going extinct like the way of the dodo bird, and I've been telling
[3:14:00.600 --> 3:14:06.080]  people this for over a decade, and finally, people are starting to pay attention.
[3:14:06.080 --> 3:14:12.040]  And like I said, these central banks, these are the enemy, and people need to understand,
[3:14:12.040 --> 3:14:14.800]  you know, look, we've allowed this to happen.
[3:14:14.800 --> 3:14:21.760]  We the people have given the power, this enormous power to run the economy, to run the financial
[3:14:21.760 --> 3:14:24.840]  system to central banks, which are private entities.
[3:14:24.840 --> 3:14:29.080]  These are no, like you were just saying, the Federal Reserve is no more federal than Federal
[3:14:29.080 --> 3:14:30.080]  Express.
[3:14:30.080 --> 3:14:35.080]  It's just, and they're not even part of the government, meanwhile, they run everything.
[3:14:35.080 --> 3:14:38.680]  It's a sick situation, and it's leading towards a climax.
[3:14:38.680 --> 3:14:43.760]  The climax is going to be very simple here, a complete meltdown in the debt market.
[3:14:43.760 --> 3:14:50.120]  Henceforth, why today, the Bank of America jumped in here with yet another round of quantitative
[3:14:50.120 --> 3:14:53.200]  easing, and now they're saying it's going to be unlimited, they're going to buy it
[3:14:53.200 --> 3:14:55.880]  all to stabilize the debt market.
[3:14:55.880 --> 3:15:01.080]  I've been warning people about this for weeks now, there was instability here in the debt
[3:15:01.080 --> 3:15:06.000]  market, and unless they did something, that was going to be it, the entire financial system
[3:15:06.000 --> 3:15:08.320]  was going to implode.
[3:15:08.320 --> 3:15:10.040]  Bank of England blinked first.
[3:15:10.040 --> 3:15:12.160]  Let's see who follows suit.
[3:15:12.160 --> 3:15:13.160]  Wow.
[3:15:13.160 --> 3:15:17.720]  We're going to go to a break soon, and we're talking with Greg Manorino.
[3:15:17.720 --> 3:15:21.720]  You have to check out his YouTube channel, become a part of traderschoice.net.
[3:15:21.720 --> 3:15:26.000]  I did that a long time ago, Smart Move, and he calls it like it is, NoVS.
[3:15:26.000 --> 3:15:27.240]  I like that about him.
[3:15:27.240 --> 3:15:33.160]  I think we need to listen to those that are calling it and saying this is exactly what's
[3:15:33.160 --> 3:15:34.160]  going to happen.
[3:15:34.160 --> 3:15:37.360]  When we come back, we'll talk about some of the signs, some of the things that may roll
[3:15:37.360 --> 3:15:42.960]  out, the dollar, the market, basically your economy looking forward.
[3:15:42.960 --> 3:15:47.040]  What do you have to expect maybe in this next year, and is there an October surprise?
[3:15:47.040 --> 3:15:48.280]  We'll talk about that too with Greg.
[3:15:48.280 --> 3:15:50.520]  We'll be right back on the Alex Jones Show.

[3:19:56.840 --> 3:20:10.880]  Getting a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:20:10.880 --> 3:20:15.560]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show and Kate Dally, your guest host from KateDallyRadio.com.
[3:20:15.560 --> 3:20:20.080]  My guest, Greg Manorino, the Robin Hood of Wall Street, wonderful YouTube channel.
[3:20:20.080 --> 3:20:22.400]  If you're not getting that, you should be.
[3:20:22.400 --> 3:20:23.400]  He calls it like it is.
[3:20:23.400 --> 3:20:30.600]  I like that and also traderschoice, traderschoice.net, I want to make sure and get it right, traderschoice.net.
[3:20:30.600 --> 3:20:35.760]  Sign up and subscribe to him because I'm telling you, you're going to love his videos.
[3:20:35.760 --> 3:20:36.880]  He just calls it.
[3:20:36.880 --> 3:20:38.680]  So let's talk a little bit about the dollar.
[3:20:38.680 --> 3:20:41.520]  I know everybody wants to know how this is going to affect them.
[3:20:41.520 --> 3:20:43.800]  What will it look like personally at home?
[3:20:43.800 --> 3:20:46.840]  What are some of the signs that you think are on their way?
[3:20:46.840 --> 3:20:48.440]  But let's talk about the dollar.
[3:20:48.440 --> 3:20:49.720]  What's happening with the dollar?
[3:20:49.720 --> 3:20:53.840]  Are they ever closer to their digital currency swap out?
[3:20:53.840 --> 3:20:56.680]  Yeah, absolutely.
[3:20:56.680 --> 3:20:57.680]  That's the end game.
[3:20:57.680 --> 3:20:59.320]  I mean, it's part of the whole thing here.
[3:20:59.320 --> 3:21:04.840]  Look, we're watching a phenomenon occur, which I've spoken about for many, many years.
[3:21:04.840 --> 3:21:08.600]  Central banks, again, public enemy number freaking one in my book here, are going to
[3:21:08.600 --> 3:21:12.800]  reach to the bottom with regard to the purchasing power of their currencies.
[3:21:12.800 --> 3:21:20.200]  They are strangling the global population to death by killing their currencies.
[3:21:20.200 --> 3:21:21.440]  And what is the effect?
[3:21:21.440 --> 3:21:29.560]  We're seeing it now, skyrocketing inflation around the world, and you've got the mainstream
[3:21:29.560 --> 3:21:35.560]  propaganda ministry pushing the biggest freaking lie in the face of the earth.
[3:21:35.560 --> 3:21:38.080]  Oh, the Federal Reserve is going to be raising rates.
[3:21:38.080 --> 3:21:41.560]  Central banks are raising rates, and they're really, really seriously.
[3:21:41.560 --> 3:21:44.720]  This time, they're going to start combating inflation.
[3:21:44.720 --> 3:21:47.400]  They're going to bring it down so everyone's life is just lovely.
[3:21:47.400 --> 3:21:52.800]  But what they're not telling people, if they don't stabilize the currency globally, which
[3:21:52.800 --> 3:21:57.040]  is in free fall, like I just said, Central banks are trying to kill their currencies
[3:21:57.040 --> 3:22:02.040]  deliberately to issue in a new system here, they can raise rates from here until kingdom
[3:22:02.040 --> 3:22:03.440]  come whenever that may be.
[3:22:03.440 --> 3:22:05.880]  It's not going to make any darn difference.
[3:22:05.880 --> 3:22:09.320]  So you've got the mainstream, and I've been telling people this since day one, oh, the
[3:22:09.320 --> 3:22:12.400]  Fed's going to raise the federal funds rate, the overnight lending rate, we're going to
[3:22:12.400 --> 3:22:15.760]  get some kind of trickle up effect that was going to slow inflation.
[3:22:15.760 --> 3:22:16.920]  How about no?
[3:22:16.920 --> 3:22:21.040]  How about it hasn't worked, and everyone following my work, everybody, has known since
[3:22:21.040 --> 3:22:24.800]  day one that it wouldn't work, but this is the lie that is being sold.
[3:22:24.800 --> 3:22:31.520]  So we have here the US dollar getting its purchasing power sucked out of it by design
[3:22:31.520 --> 3:22:42.800]  with this mummified Frankenstein brain dead president, forgive my little epithets here.
[3:22:42.800 --> 3:22:47.800]  The current administration working in concert around the world, the puppet governments
[3:22:47.800 --> 3:22:53.600]  are slaves to the essential banks who are instituting this program and this act, whenever
[3:22:53.600 --> 3:23:01.360]  it might be, to continue to pull cash from the future into the now to continue to inflate.
[3:23:01.360 --> 3:23:03.960]  It's an insane situation.
[3:23:03.960 --> 3:23:08.920]  People are getting wrecked, and they haven't seen anything yet with regard to the purchasing
[3:23:08.920 --> 3:23:13.520]  power of the dollar and other fiat currencies are going up in smoke.
[3:23:13.520 --> 3:23:18.880]  They're evaporating, and people are going to suffer a big time.
[3:23:18.880 --> 3:23:21.080]  There's just no doubt about it.
[3:23:21.080 --> 3:23:24.040]  What happens when we go to a digital currency?
[3:23:24.040 --> 3:23:29.800]  Well, this is what I see, and I think a lot of people would have to agree.
[3:23:29.800 --> 3:23:34.720]  What essential banks are looking to do is, first of all, as I said, in my view, collectively,
[3:23:34.720 --> 3:23:36.920]  they are the governing body of the world.
[3:23:36.920 --> 3:23:40.200]  Everything else is just a freak show.
[3:23:40.200 --> 3:23:41.700]  So what do they want to do?
[3:23:41.700 --> 3:23:48.240]  They want to exert as much control as they possibly can on a smaller population.
[3:23:48.240 --> 3:23:50.600]  You see all this ties together here.
[3:23:50.600 --> 3:23:56.520]  And I wrote an article years ago called Global Debt in the Human Bubble.
[3:23:56.520 --> 3:24:01.600]  What essential banks have allowed to occur here is this ballooning global debt.
[3:24:01.600 --> 3:24:02.960]  Why is that even happening here?
[3:24:02.960 --> 3:24:05.780]  Why is it that we can't have a budget?
[3:24:05.780 --> 3:24:10.020]  Why is it that central banks in collusion with their respective bumps continue to pull
[3:24:10.020 --> 3:24:11.680]  cash into the now?
[3:24:11.680 --> 3:24:18.160]  It's because globally, every developed nation on earth has a debt-based system or a debt-based
[3:24:18.160 --> 3:24:24.600]  economic model, which demands that debt be pulled into existence from the future in greater
[3:24:24.600 --> 3:24:29.320]  amounts just to sustain where we are at its current level.
[3:24:29.320 --> 3:24:35.480]  So this mechanism here has hyperinflated global debt, and the population has followed
[3:24:35.480 --> 3:24:36.880]  in tandem.
[3:24:36.880 --> 3:24:42.280]  When this debt bubble bursts and it's going to, the population is going to die off.
[3:24:42.280 --> 3:24:48.000]  That's why I am trying to tell people, anyone who will listen, that this is the greatest
[3:24:48.000 --> 3:24:50.320]  threat to humankind.
[3:24:50.320 --> 3:24:53.440]  It's a clear and present danger, but no one's being allowed to know this.
[3:24:53.440 --> 3:24:58.080]  They're being told it's this, it's global warming, it's whatever other nonsensical thing
[3:24:58.080 --> 3:25:00.720]  they want to throw at people.
[3:25:00.720 --> 3:25:04.520]  This is the real threat, and this is why central banks are now taking action.
[3:25:04.520 --> 3:25:05.880]  Today, it's historic.
[3:25:05.880 --> 3:25:09.920]  What we witnessed here with the Bank of England here is stepping in here and starting another
[3:25:09.920 --> 3:25:11.760]  round of quantitative easing.
[3:25:11.760 --> 3:25:16.760]  The US 10-year yield, which is the benchmark, everyone who follows the market kind of knows
[3:25:16.760 --> 3:25:20.760]  this, fell 24 basis points today.
[3:25:20.760 --> 3:25:21.880]  Who's buying the debt?
[3:25:21.880 --> 3:25:23.600]  Is it the average guy or the average guy?
[3:25:23.600 --> 3:25:24.600]  No, it's the Fed.
[3:25:24.600 --> 3:25:26.360]  They're jumping in here and following suit.
[3:25:26.360 --> 3:25:32.720]  This is a coordinated effort here to continue to inflate, and people are going to suffer.
[3:25:32.720 --> 3:25:36.720]  Anyway, going back to what the question here, yeah, so central banks want more control.
[3:25:36.720 --> 3:25:43.800]  They're going to allow the debt market to implode the financial system to collapse,
[3:25:43.800 --> 3:25:48.360]  and at that point there, they're going to institute a new system, which will be 100%
[3:25:48.360 --> 3:25:49.360]  digital.
[3:25:49.360 --> 3:25:54.240]  Going back, every single transaction down to the thousandth of a cent here, it's all
[3:25:54.240 --> 3:25:55.240]  about control.
[3:25:55.240 --> 3:25:57.760]  They want to know what you're doing, when you're doing it.
[3:25:57.760 --> 3:26:00.200]  We're not only one nation under surveillance.
[3:26:00.200 --> 3:26:01.920]  It gets a lot worse than that.
[3:26:01.920 --> 3:26:04.440]  Do you think they're watching you and me right now?
[3:26:04.440 --> 3:26:05.440]  Oh, yeah, hi.
[3:26:05.440 --> 3:26:06.440]  Yes, they are.
[3:26:06.440 --> 3:26:07.440]  Are you kidding me?
[3:26:07.440 --> 3:26:12.440]  It's an outrageous situation here, so look, people need to be ready for what's coming,
[3:26:12.440 --> 3:26:15.520]  and I can't stress this enough here.
[3:26:15.520 --> 3:26:21.720]  It's the debt market, which is the key, and the dollar being a unit, what is a dollar?
[3:26:21.720 --> 3:26:23.240]  Do we even own these things?
[3:26:23.240 --> 3:26:27.720]  How about, no, every dollar you have in your wallet, you see those lovely digits in your
[3:26:27.720 --> 3:26:31.240]  bank account, you don't own a single one of these things.
[3:26:31.240 --> 3:26:36.960]  They're owned by an issuing central bank, and they're owed back to the issuing central
[3:26:36.960 --> 3:26:40.640]  bank plus interest that they create out of thin air.
[3:26:40.640 --> 3:26:44.520]  Wow, that's what these things are, but it's not enough.
[3:26:44.520 --> 3:26:49.680]  They want more control, henceforth why a digital currency is coming, and it's just a matter
[3:26:49.680 --> 3:26:50.680]  of the rollout.
[3:26:50.680 --> 3:26:56.200]  In order for people are going to fight this, obviously, the smart ones, but what they're
[3:26:56.200 --> 3:27:02.120]  going to do here right now globally, what's happening here is central banks are not only
[3:27:02.120 --> 3:27:07.760]  have created nation slaves, but they're creating individual slaves, people who are dependent
[3:27:07.760 --> 3:27:13.160]  on the system, and they want more and more people dependent on the system here.
[3:27:13.160 --> 3:27:18.280]  The more people they can get dependent on the system as it collapses, the more people
[3:27:18.280 --> 3:27:20.080]  will accept it.
[3:27:20.080 --> 3:27:25.280]  This is what they're doing, and again, they need a big outcry, and the big outcry is going
[3:27:25.280 --> 3:27:29.640]  to be a locking up of the financial system, the credit market, the debt markets, run
[3:27:29.640 --> 3:27:30.640]  it all.
[3:27:30.640 --> 3:27:34.160]  The stock market itself is not independent of anything.
[3:27:34.160 --> 3:27:39.600]  It derives value from what's occurring in the debt market overall, we're talking about
[3:27:39.600 --> 3:27:44.160]  central banks who are actually buying it all, and that's what they've been doing now for
[3:27:44.160 --> 3:27:47.400]  a very, very long time, despite what they're whispering to people through the mainstream
[3:27:47.400 --> 3:27:50.240]  propaganda and the ministry, but we've got proof that they are today.
[3:27:50.240 --> 3:27:52.640]  Anyway, that's the situation with this.
[3:27:52.640 --> 3:27:57.480]  People need to be ready because this is the greatest threat to human life, period the end,
[3:27:57.480 --> 3:28:00.240]  and I'm glad people are hearing this because it's just so important.
[3:28:00.240 --> 3:28:01.640]  Absolutely.
[3:28:01.640 --> 3:28:03.680]  Can you come back for one more segment?
[3:28:03.680 --> 3:28:04.680]  There's questions.
[3:28:04.680 --> 3:28:05.680]  There's so many questions.
[3:28:05.680 --> 3:28:10.960]  Let's talk about October surprise, a little bit about that.
[3:28:10.960 --> 3:28:15.400]  We have about 45 seconds, we'll go to a break, but I have a lot of questions.
[3:28:15.400 --> 3:28:20.160]  The average person out there says, I think they're thinking, is this a crash overnight?
[3:28:20.160 --> 3:28:26.240]  Is it something that we're just made to, we can't afford anything, it's just going to
[3:28:26.240 --> 3:28:28.480]  keep getting worse and worse and worse.
[3:28:28.480 --> 3:28:29.480]  How does this happen?
[3:28:29.480 --> 3:28:30.480]  How does this roll out?
[3:28:30.480 --> 3:28:34.640]  I know last October they did a plan where they said we were going to crash the market,
[3:28:34.640 --> 3:28:39.560]  and maybe for about 10 months to a year, they pay everybody's loans so that you're pacified
[3:28:39.560 --> 3:28:43.920]  and everybody's happy, and then you have to go back into digital currency in order to
[3:28:43.920 --> 3:28:47.400]  claim your loans on your things to be able to make payments.
[3:28:47.400 --> 3:28:48.400]  That would be very interesting.
[3:28:48.400 --> 3:28:53.320]  We'll come right back with Greg Manorino, Robin Hood of Wall Street, TradersChoice.net.
[3:28:53.320 --> 3:28:56.000]  We'll be right back on the Alex Jones show.

[3:31:28.240 --> 3:31:30.360]  This really is the missing link.
[3:31:30.360 --> 3:31:37.160]  X3 sold out for a long time is finally back in stock, available at InfowarsStore.com, or
[3:31:37.160 --> 3:31:41.200]  by calling toll free, triple A, 253-3139.
[3:31:41.200 --> 3:31:46.040]  Now it takes a few weeks for this high quality iodine to kick in, but almost everybody after
[3:31:46.040 --> 3:31:47.520]  that feels the effects.
[3:31:47.520 --> 3:31:51.960]  It's not just for your immune system, but it's for your energy and so much more.
[3:31:51.960 --> 3:31:55.960]  X3 back in stock at InfowarsStore.com, 50% off.
[3:31:55.960 --> 3:32:01.080]  Look around you, everything I predicted from the Globlestone documents from their own admissions
[3:32:01.080 --> 3:32:02.360]  is now happening.
[3:32:02.360 --> 3:32:07.560]  Infowars credibility, my credibility has never been higher, and it's because of your backing
[3:32:07.560 --> 3:32:13.200]  of this operation that I could steadfastly, despite the censorship and the boycotts and
[3:32:13.200 --> 3:32:15.760]  the attacks and the lawsuits, stay on air.
[3:32:15.760 --> 3:32:20.600]  But now we're reaching the most critical juncture in the fight together.
[3:32:20.600 --> 3:32:25.800]  So I want to ask all of you today to help keep me on the air.
[3:32:25.800 --> 3:32:29.720]  In my decades on air, I've never asked for personal donations, but I'm being forced by
[3:32:29.720 --> 3:32:35.240]  the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees, and I can't fund those myself.
[3:32:35.240 --> 3:32:36.240]  It's unsustainable.
[3:32:36.240 --> 3:32:44.440]  So please, visit saveinfowars.com, saveinfowars.com, where you can make straight donations, $5,
[3:32:44.440 --> 3:32:48.760]  $10, $50, $100, whatever you can, so that I can continue to persevere.
[3:32:48.760 --> 3:32:52.040]  I'll never give up, I'll never give in, but I could give out.
[3:32:52.040 --> 3:32:53.040]  Thank you for your support.
[3:32:53.040 --> 3:32:56.840]  Wouldn't be without you, saveinfowars.com.
[3:32:56.840 --> 3:33:10.640]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:33:10.640 --> 3:33:12.160]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:33:12.160 --> 3:33:15.840]  Back here with you, I'm Kate Daly, your guest host from KateDalyRadio.com.
[3:33:15.840 --> 3:33:19.040]  My guest is Greg Manorino, so glad he's joining me today.
[3:33:19.040 --> 3:33:21.800]  The Robin Hood of Wall Street, I love this.
[3:33:21.800 --> 3:33:27.480]  Check out his YouTube and TradersChoice.net, gives you great advice on what to maybe put
[3:33:27.480 --> 3:33:31.200]  into the stock market, just what's going on generally.
[3:33:31.200 --> 3:33:34.440]  I love his context.
[3:33:34.440 --> 3:33:40.440]  And also, I just wanted to mention, the thing that I was talking about in October was the
[3:33:40.440 --> 3:33:46.480]  drill, the drill that they did last October where they were going to do some funky moves
[3:33:46.480 --> 3:33:50.840]  with people's money and act like it was chaos and digital currency saves the day, but you
[3:33:50.840 --> 3:33:57.480]  have to access digital currency, part of the system, in order to get your loans back, get
[3:33:57.480 --> 3:34:04.080]  your house payments online again or your car payments online again.
[3:34:04.080 --> 3:34:06.640]  So is Greg still with us?
[3:34:06.640 --> 3:34:08.520]  Yeah, I'm still here.
[3:34:08.520 --> 3:34:09.520]  Perfect.
[3:34:09.520 --> 3:34:16.160]  So, let me put it this way, people envision sort of a 1920s depression, you know, does
[3:34:16.160 --> 3:34:17.160]  it look like that?
[3:34:17.160 --> 3:34:19.480]  Does it look like much worse?
[3:34:19.480 --> 3:34:23.160]  Because they always use that as the kind of the scalability of what can happen or what's
[3:34:23.160 --> 3:34:24.160]  going to happen.
[3:34:24.160 --> 3:34:27.640]  But I've been talking to some billionaires and they've been saying it's going to be much,
[3:34:27.640 --> 3:34:28.640]  much worse.
[3:34:28.640 --> 3:34:34.600]  So if this was a theater production of a 10 act play, what actor we in, do you think?
[3:34:34.600 --> 3:34:37.640]  Right now, we're in the extreme early stages of this.
[3:34:37.640 --> 3:34:42.520]  And when this thing really gets going, look, people don't have to guess.
[3:34:42.520 --> 3:34:47.840]  There's a couple of things that I have informed people that they need to pay attention to.
[3:34:47.840 --> 3:34:56.680]  This whole thing is designed to and will eventually melt down greater than anyone can really possibly
[3:34:56.680 --> 3:34:57.680]  imagine.
[3:34:57.680 --> 3:35:00.600]  Let me explain this to people who focus on the stock market.
[3:35:00.600 --> 3:35:05.840]  There's not actually on any asset today, there is no price discovery mechanism behind
[3:35:05.840 --> 3:35:06.840]  anything.
[3:35:06.840 --> 3:35:10.600]  We have a debt market, which has been rigged by central banks and they're continuing to
[3:35:10.600 --> 3:35:16.520]  rig as of right now, Bank of England jumping in here with a new round of QE here, understanding
[3:35:16.520 --> 3:35:21.840]  that every asset derives value from what's happening in the debt market, which is exponentially
[3:35:21.840 --> 3:35:25.120]  larger than the stock market.
[3:35:25.120 --> 3:35:26.120]  Nothing is real.
[3:35:26.120 --> 3:35:29.480]  No one even knows where the bottom is with regard to the stock market.
[3:35:29.480 --> 3:35:30.480]  We're going to have a crash.
[3:35:30.480 --> 3:35:31.480]  When is that going to happen?
[3:35:31.480 --> 3:35:32.680]  Look, there's no guesswork here.
[3:35:32.680 --> 3:35:36.960]  There's one thing on my website that's free to everyone who wants to look at it, it's
[3:35:36.960 --> 3:35:41.840]  called the MMRI, Manorino Market Risk Indicator.
[3:35:41.840 --> 3:35:47.040]  This is here, it looks at basically the debt market, the 10-year yield, including the US
[3:35:47.040 --> 3:35:50.200]  dollar puts it in a neat little equation and comes up with a number.
[3:35:50.200 --> 3:35:55.520]  That number is color coded as to risk in the market based upon action in the debt market.
[3:35:55.520 --> 3:36:01.040]  By following the MMRI, which is free, 100%, by following the US 10-year yield, by following
[3:36:01.040 --> 3:36:07.120]  the US dollar, we can have a very good idea as to, there you go, as to when this thing
[3:36:07.120 --> 3:36:10.360]  is going to melt down.
[3:36:10.360 --> 3:36:14.920]  I've been saying the MMRI has hit record high after record high, after record high, just
[3:36:14.920 --> 3:36:19.360]  over the past few weeks, and I've been telling people, unless central banks do something
[3:36:19.360 --> 3:36:20.920]  and do it now, it's over.
[3:36:20.920 --> 3:36:21.920]  Well, what just happened?
[3:36:21.920 --> 3:36:24.280]  I mean, sometimes I freaking scare myself.
[3:36:24.280 --> 3:36:25.280]  I'm not lying.
[3:36:25.280 --> 3:36:27.400]  But the truth of the matter is this is easy.
[3:36:27.400 --> 3:36:28.640]  It's easy to understand.
[3:36:28.640 --> 3:36:34.080]  I have been, look, they're not ready yet, in my view, to implode the system.
[3:36:34.080 --> 3:36:38.720]  And the implosion in this system is not going to look anything like the Great Depression
[3:36:38.720 --> 3:36:39.720]  here.
[3:36:39.720 --> 3:36:42.960]  Okay, what's going to end up happening here, first of all, it's a power shift.
[3:36:42.960 --> 3:36:48.160]  It's a power grab, is what they're really going for by bringing down the financial
[3:36:48.160 --> 3:36:55.480]  system in its current form and bringing forth a new one with more control over a much smaller
[3:36:55.480 --> 3:36:56.480]  population.
[3:36:56.480 --> 3:36:58.400]  This is the key here.
[3:36:58.400 --> 3:37:05.360]  This implosion in the debt market, again, is a survival issue, a resource problem.
[3:37:05.360 --> 3:37:08.680]  I urge people to look up global debt in the human bubble.
[3:37:08.680 --> 3:37:10.320]  It's an article I wrote years ago.
[3:37:10.320 --> 3:37:13.480]  It's playing out right before our eyes right now here.
[3:37:13.480 --> 3:37:18.480]  So the financial system implosion is going to, again, lead to a resource issue.
[3:37:18.480 --> 3:37:19.480]  And what's going to happen?
[3:37:19.480 --> 3:37:23.440]  The same people that are bringing this to its knees, the world economy and the financial
[3:37:23.440 --> 3:37:27.760]  system, which is the central banks collectively, they're going to be the same ones people
[3:37:27.760 --> 3:37:29.480]  are going to look to for help.
[3:37:29.480 --> 3:37:30.480]  Help us, please.
[3:37:30.480 --> 3:37:31.640]  I mean, are you kidding me?
[3:37:31.640 --> 3:37:32.640]  But this is what they do.
[3:37:32.640 --> 3:37:34.720]  This is how it's being set up.
[3:37:34.720 --> 3:37:40.720]  So this next thing, forget about the great, this is going to be pandemonium on the streets
[3:37:40.720 --> 3:37:42.800]  on a biblical scale.
[3:37:42.800 --> 3:37:46.280]  I mean, people are going to be, you know, look, I'm going to tell people, you've got
[3:37:46.280 --> 3:37:52.200]  to prepare yourself mentally, spiritually, physically, every way you can for what's coming
[3:37:52.200 --> 3:37:53.200]  down the pike here.
[3:37:53.200 --> 3:37:58.480]  You know, look, it could happen in any moment, if in fact, we did not see action from the
[3:37:58.480 --> 3:38:04.960]  Bank of England today within a matter of days or weeks, this entire thing was going to come
[3:38:04.960 --> 3:38:05.960]  down.
[3:38:05.960 --> 3:38:09.480]  But I've also been telling people for weeks that I don't think they're ready yet.
[3:38:09.480 --> 3:38:13.040]  I think central banks are going to continue to inflate.
[3:38:13.040 --> 3:38:17.080]  They, they, they, what do they do, central banks have one product and that is debt.
[3:38:17.080 --> 3:38:22.520]  They issue this debt here in the form of currency and they, they buy assets with it.
[3:38:22.520 --> 3:38:29.640]  They're buying the world, they're the enemy here, they're the enemy and people need to
[3:38:29.640 --> 3:38:30.640]  take action.
[3:38:30.640 --> 3:38:35.280]  I'm telling you, me, you, Alex and whoever else should go outside the freaking Federal
[3:38:35.280 --> 3:38:40.240]  Reserve and that's the building that should be stormed here, not the capital.
[3:38:40.240 --> 3:38:41.240]  Right.
[3:38:41.240 --> 3:38:42.240]  Absolutely.
[3:38:42.240 --> 3:38:46.400]  You know, it was a manufactured depression and it was right after G's, coincidentally,
[3:38:46.400 --> 3:38:51.080]  the central banks formed in 1913 and then of course you have this depression, but you
[3:38:51.080 --> 3:38:54.680]  had the freedom, if you had a dollar, you had the freedom to use that dollar.
[3:38:54.680 --> 3:38:57.080]  It's going to look very different with control in the future.
[3:38:57.080 --> 3:38:58.080]  Oh yeah.
[3:38:58.080 --> 3:38:59.080]  Yeah.
[3:38:59.080 --> 3:39:00.080]  You don't get to see it.
[3:39:00.080 --> 3:39:01.080]  Absolutely.
[3:39:01.080 --> 3:39:03.400]  And this is going to be an inflationary depression on a massive scale.
[3:39:03.400 --> 3:39:05.560]  And again, yeah, because that's what they're going to do.
[3:39:05.560 --> 3:39:10.200]  Once this thing comes down and your currency is literally worthless at that particular
[3:39:10.200 --> 3:39:14.440]  point, then comes the new system and people are going to beg for it.
[3:39:14.440 --> 3:39:15.440]  See that's the worst part.
[3:39:15.440 --> 3:39:16.440]  Right.
[3:39:16.440 --> 3:39:17.440]  People are going to beg for help.
[3:39:17.440 --> 3:39:18.960]  They're going to beg for the new system.
[3:39:18.960 --> 3:39:20.800]  This is how it's being set up.
[3:39:20.800 --> 3:39:24.680]  It's so obvious to me and I think the most people will follow our work, how it's being
[3:39:24.680 --> 3:39:25.680]  set up.
[3:39:25.680 --> 3:39:27.080]  It's an incredible thing to see.
[3:39:27.080 --> 3:39:32.120]  It's horrible to have to witness the suffering of people at night right now.
[3:39:32.120 --> 3:39:35.960]  People are suffering, but you know, you remember what Biden said, there's no inflation and
[3:39:35.960 --> 3:39:36.960]  everyone's rich.
[3:39:36.960 --> 3:39:37.960]  We're all doing great.
[3:39:37.960 --> 3:39:41.160]  You can't make this stuff up if you try to.
[3:39:41.160 --> 3:39:42.680]  No, you're right.
[3:39:42.680 --> 3:39:43.680]  You're so right.
[3:39:43.680 --> 3:39:44.680]  I know we only have a few minutes.
[3:39:44.680 --> 3:39:46.000]  October surprise.
[3:39:46.000 --> 3:39:47.720]  What would that be at this point?
[3:39:47.720 --> 3:39:52.200]  You know, everyone I think is just in like Stockholm syndrome right now, expecting an
[3:39:52.200 --> 3:39:53.200]  October surprise.
[3:39:53.200 --> 3:39:56.000]  What do you think that would be in this, in this way?
[3:39:56.000 --> 3:39:57.000]  In the monetary?
[3:39:57.000 --> 3:40:01.600]  Well, people that have been, you know, everyone's talking about this market, a potential crash
[3:40:01.600 --> 3:40:02.600]  in the market.
[3:40:02.600 --> 3:40:04.600]  Look, like I said, we don't have to guess you and me.
[3:40:04.600 --> 3:40:06.080]  We look at the 10 year yield.
[3:40:06.080 --> 3:40:11.040]  We followed the US dollar or the Dixie, the relative strength of the dollar or better yet
[3:40:11.040 --> 3:40:13.720]  follow the MMRI, Manorino Market Risk Indicator.
[3:40:13.720 --> 3:40:17.240]  When you see that thing spiking like crazy, like it's been doing recently.
[3:40:17.240 --> 3:40:20.000]  I should say, hold on a minute, something's going on here.
[3:40:20.000 --> 3:40:23.280]  So we don't have to sit here and guess if there's going to be an October surprise, November
[3:40:23.280 --> 3:40:24.280]  surprise.
[3:40:24.280 --> 3:40:30.240]  We can pretty much gauge where this is going to go by just following a few metrics.
[3:40:30.240 --> 3:40:33.600]  And when it does happen, it's going to be extremely rapid.
[3:40:33.600 --> 3:40:38.800]  We watched just for example today, the 10 year yield dropping like 24, 25 basis points.
[3:40:38.800 --> 3:40:44.440]  We had the opposite effect where the 10 year yield was rising 20, 30, 40 basis points in
[3:40:44.440 --> 3:40:49.400]  one day, we destroy the stock market and people are going to run to the door as they always
[3:40:49.400 --> 3:40:51.400]  do at the same time.
[3:40:51.400 --> 3:40:52.600]  So it's not a slow burn.
[3:40:52.600 --> 3:40:54.520]  A crash is rapid.
[3:40:54.520 --> 3:40:59.160]  A crash in the debt market or a meltdown in the debt market would be rapid followed by
[3:40:59.160 --> 3:41:02.040]  a massive sell off in the stock market.
[3:41:02.040 --> 3:41:03.520]  Like I said, no one knows where the bottom is.
[3:41:03.520 --> 3:41:09.880]  The Fed stopped stepped in here at $6,000 the last time with quantitative easing one.
[3:41:09.880 --> 3:41:12.000]  The bottom could be down $2,000.
[3:41:12.000 --> 3:41:13.600]  No one knows where the bottom is.
[3:41:13.600 --> 3:41:15.600]  The bottom is pit.
[3:41:15.600 --> 3:41:16.600]  That's where we're going.
[3:41:16.600 --> 3:41:22.600]  Unfortunately, what people need to band together, be ready for a worst case scenario.
[3:41:22.600 --> 3:41:23.600]  Period the end.
[3:41:23.600 --> 3:41:24.600]  Prepare yourself.
[3:41:24.600 --> 3:41:25.600]  It's going to happen.
[3:41:25.600 --> 3:41:26.600]  Just a matter of when.
[3:41:26.600 --> 3:41:28.600]  And we don't have to guess, like I said.
[3:41:28.600 --> 3:41:29.600]  Diversify?
[3:41:29.600 --> 3:41:32.800]  Because a lot of people out there are saying, what do I do with my 401k?
[3:41:32.800 --> 3:41:33.800]  What do I do here?
[3:41:33.800 --> 3:41:35.120]  How do I save myself?
[3:41:35.120 --> 3:41:36.120]  Diversify?
[3:41:36.120 --> 3:41:40.960]  It's very sad because people are stuck in an investment usually that only makes money
[3:41:40.960 --> 3:41:42.720]  when the stock market goes up.
[3:41:42.720 --> 3:41:45.520]  And then what happens is you've got the investment banks here.
[3:41:45.520 --> 3:41:48.400]  What they do is they bet against their own clients on the way down.
[3:41:48.400 --> 3:41:50.960]  And it's just a wealth transfer from one group of people to another.
[3:41:50.960 --> 3:41:54.400]  What people need to do is to protect themselves.
[3:41:54.400 --> 3:41:56.320]  Here's my favorite asset on the planet right here.
[3:41:56.320 --> 3:41:57.400]  It's physical silver.
[3:41:57.400 --> 3:42:00.640]  I think this is the most undivided asset on the planet.
[3:42:00.640 --> 3:42:02.400]  I have a nice hoard of it.
[3:42:02.400 --> 3:42:03.400]  I own gold.
[3:42:03.400 --> 3:42:04.400]  I own platinum.
[3:42:04.400 --> 3:42:05.400]  I'm a palladium as well.
[3:42:05.400 --> 3:42:08.160]  I think it's very simple to understand where this works.
[3:42:08.160 --> 3:42:10.960]  You got risk on meeting cash going into the stock market.
[3:42:10.960 --> 3:42:15.840]  And you've got to risk off a scenario like I was explaining to melt down the debt market,
[3:42:15.840 --> 3:42:16.840]  destroys the stock market.
[3:42:16.840 --> 3:42:19.600]  Cash doesn't grow money wings and fly away to money heaven.
[3:42:19.600 --> 3:42:20.600]  No.
[3:42:20.600 --> 3:42:24.400]  It just moves into other assets and in my view, it's going to move into commodities
[3:42:24.400 --> 3:42:27.320]  because they're real things.
[3:42:27.320 --> 3:42:28.320]  Commodities.
[3:42:28.320 --> 3:42:29.320]  All right.

[3:43:01.120 --> 3:43:05.440]  Just take a moment and sit back and think about all the incredible guests and callers

[3:43:07.640 --> 3:43:10.760]  This family that is info wars.
[3:43:10.760 --> 3:43:15.880]  Think about how info wars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and Bolsonaro and
[3:43:15.880 --> 3:43:23.360]  other foreign leaders like Nigel Farage as being the main impetus towards firing up their
[3:43:23.360 --> 3:43:26.880]  main base to defeat the new world order.
[3:43:26.880 --> 3:43:32.640]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today is because the viewers and listeners

[3:47:31.080 --> 3:47:36.080]  to comment on the pipelines since this just happened and i kind of give you my two cents
[3:47:36.080 --> 3:47:41.120]  couple of theories and a big thank you to greg manorino traders choice dot net is the website
[3:47:41.120 --> 3:47:46.440]  and you'll get some great advice i love love greg he's fantastic he's fantastic it's fun
[3:47:46.440 --> 3:47:51.400]  to listen to him so are we going to war a lot of people think that the pipelines is sort
[3:47:51.400 --> 3:48:00.960]  of like every sunkship that begins i that that begins this this road to to a war well i just
[3:48:00.960 --> 3:48:05.960]  to kind of go back in time a little bit Nord Stream one was completed in two thousand eleven
[3:48:05.960 --> 3:48:14.160]  and Nord Stream two which runs under the Baltic sea sort of bypassing Ukraine of course this
[3:48:14.160 --> 3:48:24.680]  started i i think this was 2020 2021 right and so now we have a situation where we have
[3:48:24.680 --> 3:48:31.400]  this they say strategic objection right you know this is what they want they want europe
[3:48:31.400 --> 3:48:37.120]  is too dependent on Russia increasing Russia's influence in Europe and Russia could use it
[3:48:37.120 --> 3:48:42.520]  as a geopolitical weapon utilities of course this pipeline so Ukraine has objected it
[3:48:42.520 --> 3:48:47.800]  because they lose around two billion in transit fees so a lot of people don't realize that
[3:48:47.800 --> 3:48:53.480]  part of it that Ukraine is is not getting the money out of it that they normally do
[3:48:53.480 --> 3:48:59.640]  and so i as long as Russia gas transits through Ukraine rush is likely to intervene right
[3:48:59.640 --> 3:49:06.480]  and instability all the way around so Europe requires about a hundred billion cubic meters
[3:49:06.480 --> 3:49:13.680]  of natural gas each year and this pipeline will do about a hundred and ten which is kind
[3:49:13.680 --> 3:49:19.120]  of a kind of interesting so back in February Germany halts the approval of the gas pipeline
[3:49:19.120 --> 3:49:24.800]  Nord Stream two right after Russia's actions in February right before that all started
[3:49:24.800 --> 3:49:31.800]  in Ukraine and the chancellor Schultz asked the German the German economy ministry to
[3:49:31.800 --> 3:49:36.000]  take steps to make sure that the pipeline couldn't be certified at this point in time
[3:49:36.000 --> 3:49:40.600]  and without that certification it couldn't operate it's actually turned off then of
[3:49:40.600 --> 3:49:48.920]  course Russia Russia says they have a maintenance problem in August with the pipeline one turned
[3:49:48.920 --> 3:49:54.400]  that off and on some people view it as a precursor to hey it's a threat or be really
[3:49:54.400 --> 3:50:00.120]  maintenance who's to know the eleven billion dollar pipeline was designed to double the
[3:50:00.120 --> 3:50:05.320]  amount of gas flowing from Russia to Germany and of course it was completed in twenty twenty
[3:50:05.320 --> 3:50:11.120]  one but if Nord Stream did go ahead then Ukraine would lose the money kind of an interesting
[3:50:11.120 --> 3:50:15.800]  little pickle that we're in so the United States would like to increase its liquefied
[3:50:15.800 --> 3:50:22.520]  natural gas exports to Europe this was being reported all this is not interesting Germany
[3:50:22.520 --> 3:50:28.200]  in August Germany's natural gas was already eighty percent full and the country was going
[3:50:28.200 --> 3:50:34.400]  to reach its October target early and this was without that pipeline number one that
[3:50:34.400 --> 3:50:39.240]  pipeline number two that's shut up that's not even working yet but the number one as
[3:50:39.240 --> 3:50:44.720]  it was turned off they said you know what we've got eighty percent full we only need ninety
[3:50:44.720 --> 3:50:49.920]  percent so they're only about five percent shy so everybody's talking about the utilities
[3:50:49.920 --> 3:50:54.640]  everybody's talking about Germany how cold it gets they're going to be without heat but
[3:50:54.640 --> 3:50:58.840]  is that actually true because August twenty ninth they came out and said yeah we're almost
[3:50:58.840 --> 3:51:05.160]  at eighty five percent gee what was the other five percent well of course it was liquefied
[3:51:05.160 --> 3:51:12.160]  natural gas that they could get from us interesting so it's a major win for Germany because right
[3:51:12.160 --> 3:51:17.200]  they previously sourced thirty two percent of their natural gas from Russia but the EU
[3:51:17.200 --> 3:51:24.000]  needs to boost its supplies right to reserve to at least ninety to have a safe winter so
[3:51:24.000 --> 3:51:28.400]  are they still going to act like they're in a crisis to the German population well of
[3:51:28.400 --> 3:51:34.360]  course they are so they came out Robert Habek a German economy minister said he hoped rationing
[3:51:34.360 --> 3:51:39.680]  wouldn't be necessary to get through the winter but couldn't rule it out exactly so gas is
[3:51:39.680 --> 3:51:46.440]  now on short supply in Germany he said but is it back in February there was an article
[3:51:46.440 --> 3:51:52.880]  written in Germany and it said can Germany function without Putin's gas the green federal
[3:51:52.880 --> 3:51:59.720]  economics minister Habek answered with this decisive very very decisive yes it can we
[3:51:59.720 --> 3:52:05.160]  can survive without that gas and he announced the suspension of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline
[3:52:05.160 --> 3:52:10.800]  right because they didn't certify it why well there were a lot of green reasons why they
[3:52:10.800 --> 3:52:18.280]  didn't do it interesting so Germany announces the withdrawal from nuclear nuclear power
[3:52:18.280 --> 3:52:24.240]  after the 2011 Fukushima disaster and said it would pull the plug on coal fired plants
[3:52:24.240 --> 3:52:27.640]  leaving observers like kind of wondering you know well how will the country plan to make
[3:52:27.640 --> 3:52:34.400]  its energy policy work of course and future proof and so one of the government's main
[3:52:34.400 --> 3:52:39.400]  predicaments in this was whether or not it could on its promise to make this switch to
[3:52:39.400 --> 3:52:44.600]  renewable energy sources of course to meet the great race the great reset to reach its
[3:52:44.600 --> 3:52:51.480]  climate goal and to become carbon neutral by 2045 gas is seen as this sort of vital
[3:52:51.480 --> 3:52:58.240]  bridge in that endeavor right and of course climate experts think it's barely adequate
[3:52:58.240 --> 3:53:03.680]  we're not going in the right direction so was the pipeline something that they could
[3:53:03.680 --> 3:53:10.640]  do this to to create a situation where Germany is sort of now leading out see we can survive
[3:53:10.640 --> 3:53:17.400]  and we can do all of these other things that meet the great reset they're really really
[3:53:17.400 --> 3:53:23.040]  counting on the fact they can get this through and of course there's a lot of pressure the
[3:53:23.040 --> 3:53:29.280]  UN came out and basically said it's now or never it's now or never you're either going
[3:53:29.280 --> 3:53:37.560]  to jump on this the future of this or not and so is LNG gets sustainable hmm some people
[3:53:37.560 --> 3:53:44.680]  say it's not and some people say that it is it's only sustainable and and of course it
[3:53:44.680 --> 3:53:48.840]  can be this you know for climate change and pollution it's the direction we need to go
[3:53:48.840 --> 3:53:55.440]  and so coincidentally we get to sell this to Germany to fill in the gap even though they're
[3:53:55.440 --> 3:54:02.800]  already almost there we're going to fill in the gap hmm so you can either go with the
[3:54:02.800 --> 3:54:07.600]  narrative and we can go with the back and forth ping pong of what's happening right
[3:54:07.600 --> 3:54:10.920]  because there's a lot here there's a lot here there's a lot of steps have been made this
[3:54:10.920 --> 3:54:17.040]  isn't the first time it's happened we've had things happening 2006 2007 all kinds of things
[3:54:17.040 --> 3:54:21.760]  we even had an incident back in 2020 with the pipelines but is it more like the Truman
[3:54:21.760 --> 3:54:27.200]  show you never know if you go back in history and you're a fan of history and you study
[3:54:27.200 --> 3:54:32.800]  history every war has been created they don't just use the powers that be don't just use
[3:54:32.800 --> 3:54:39.160]  what's there they create it from the ground up so if you really wanted to look at this
[3:54:39.160 --> 3:54:46.960]  from maybe a different view is is are the pipelines where they created by the powers
[3:54:46.960 --> 3:54:55.000]  that be to be the plot in a very big theater production of war could be right you can't
[3:54:55.000 --> 3:55:01.560]  get pipelines to go through all of those countries without it being absolutely ordained by those
[3:55:01.560 --> 3:55:08.040]  that run this world and so if that's the case this becomes the plot right you have two very
[3:55:08.040 --> 3:55:12.600]  convenient pipelines that are going to sound very threatening and that they're going to
[3:55:12.600 --> 3:55:19.280]  bring on a crisis and then of course it brings you into the emotions of well people are being
[3:55:19.280 --> 3:55:25.440]  deprived rush is the bad guy now we got to go in and get Russia it's interesting I think
[3:55:25.440 --> 3:55:29.480]  they're very much a player in this and I think that if you really kind of take a broad view
[3:55:29.480 --> 3:55:35.480]  of this if you really want to step out of the comfort zone kind of look at it as as
[3:55:35.480 --> 3:55:42.120]  the entire production is playing out usually they use a ship the downing of a ship or the
[3:55:42.120 --> 3:55:46.480]  guy went berserk and he's murdering babies I mean it's always some sort of emotional
[3:55:46.480 --> 3:55:51.760]  ploy to get us in people being cold for the winter and not having any utilities that's
[3:55:51.760 --> 3:55:59.040]  a pretty big deal isn't it and if the powers of be wanted to you know why this wouldn't
[3:55:59.040 --> 3:56:05.480]  be happening unless they wanted it to be happening and so is this the big precursor for war the
[3:56:05.480 --> 3:56:10.840]  only way we can start to kind of see through this very big Truman show is to really kind
[3:56:10.840 --> 3:56:15.160]  of concentrate on the fact that we see it you're not going to fool us again we're not
[3:56:15.160 --> 3:56:20.760]  going to you know we could end up in a war very much so we could and this could be the
[3:56:20.760 --> 3:56:26.160]  precursor but I think what people miss is that it's so extremely manufactured from
[3:56:26.160 --> 3:56:32.680]  the beginning if the Rockefellers are the people of them of course not named are the
[3:56:32.680 --> 3:56:37.720]  ones that made sure these pipelines happened and this becomes the plot of display it'll
[3:56:37.720 --> 3:56:41.080]  be it's kind of interesting to go back in the news and realize there's a real tug of
[3:56:41.080 --> 3:56:46.000]  war for information going on on what's the truth and what's not the truth about do they
[3:56:46.000 --> 3:56:50.760]  need this do they not are they compromised is Germany compromised is Germany just leading
[3:56:50.760 --> 3:56:57.160]  out in this there's a lot there that you might want to look at maybe just a little bit differently
[3:56:57.160 --> 3:57:03.520]  it might help because I think ploy after ploy war after war we've been drug into these things
[3:57:03.520 --> 3:57:08.680]  for false pretenses and this might just be another one are they all players do they all
[3:57:08.680 --> 3:57:15.960]  play their part maybe so maybe so I really don't think I don't think Russia has all the
[3:57:15.960 --> 3:57:20.360]  control over these pipelines that they want us to think that they do and I do think it
[3:57:20.360 --> 3:57:26.720]  sets them up as you know the the enemy but in a war situation who's really fighting
[3:57:26.720 --> 3:57:32.360]  each other right who's really fighting we took over Ukraine in 2014 is it really the
[3:57:32.360 --> 3:57:37.840]  Ukraine that's fighting Russia I don't know probably not but something to think about
