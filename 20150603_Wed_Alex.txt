[00:00.000 --> 00:13.420]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:13.420 --> 00:21.860]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex
[00:21.860 --> 00:31.160]  jones we have another dizzying platter of just bizarre behavior by the ruling
[00:31.160 --> 00:37.440]  kleptocratic class today and it is the healthy exposure of that will finally
[00:37.440 --> 00:44.000]  bring these tyrants down we have a nsa whistleblower who is a colleague of the
[00:44.000 --> 00:49.480]  director of technical at the national security agency of course bill benny we
[00:49.480 --> 00:56.740]  have Kirk we be coming on the broadcast to break down his expert take on the
[00:56.740 --> 01:07.500]  so-called Orwellian named American Freedom Act or USA Freedom Act that Lord
[01:07.500 --> 01:14.740]  Obama has now signed into law passed by the Congress yesterday evening out of the
[01:14.740 --> 01:19.460]  Senate with 67 yes votes and it is called the USA Freedom Act so it must be
[01:19.460 --> 01:24.380]  wonderful I guess if you labeled cyanide pills with red white and blue it'd be
[01:24.380 --> 01:28.260]  okay for children to take of course would really kill them but we're going to
[01:28.260 --> 01:36.060]  break down what this act actually does and why Rand Paul was opposing it very
[01:36.060 --> 01:40.220]  schizophrenic reporting by Fox News CNN and others because I watched some last
[01:40.220 --> 01:44.180]  night this morning trying to figure out we you know where they were going with
[01:44.180 --> 01:48.940]  it and actually went to some of the different constitutional organization
[01:48.940 --> 01:53.920]  sites to see what they were saying and the National Constitution Center says
[01:53.920 --> 01:58.620]  it's bad news and we have gone to the subsections and we'll go over those here
[01:58.620 --> 02:03.420]  on air but CNN this morning had a couple articles one saying that bulk
[02:03.420 --> 02:07.020]  collection was ending and it was a big victory for Snowden I have that article
[02:07.020 --> 02:13.020]  here then another one by Jeremy Diamond saying thought bulk data collection was
[02:13.020 --> 02:18.860]  gone think again admitting the things of fraud so this just goes to show that so
[02:18.860 --> 02:24.460]  much of it is basically in the eye of the beholder or how it's spun people
[02:24.460 --> 02:29.500]  asking all the time it you know you say mainstream media is discredited in lives
[02:29.500 --> 02:36.420]  but then you use it as a source well there are some reporters at CNN that
[02:36.420 --> 02:40.260]  have told the truth there are some reporters at CBS News that have told
[02:40.260 --> 02:46.220]  the truth there are a lot of reporters on Fox News that tell the truth Fox News
[02:46.220 --> 02:54.100]  tells about half the truth the other half spending lies CNN 75% lies 25%
[02:54.100 --> 03:03.140]  truth MSNBC about 90% lies and that's just my dead reckoning watching them but
[03:03.140 --> 03:07.220]  Fox News is almost more dangerous because since they have so much truthful
[03:07.220 --> 03:12.220]  stuff on there people then accept the lies that much more it's like putting
[03:12.220 --> 03:16.740]  the cyanide into a steak and you don't know what you're eating until you fall
[03:16.740 --> 03:23.060]  over dead whereas CNN or MSNBC is just a steak with maggots crawling out of it
[03:23.060 --> 03:26.100]  that's been you know laying out in the sun for a week and stinks to high heaven
[03:26.100 --> 03:33.100]  you're not gonna bite into it but a big sizzling delicious tomahawk you know
[03:33.100 --> 03:42.100]  50 ounce steak dripping with juices it looks very palatable doesn't it and of
[03:42.100 --> 03:46.540]  course speaking of dripping with the dripping with deliciousness I mean you
[03:46.540 --> 03:52.060]  got all the info babes up there looking at you with sexual allure smiling and
[03:52.060 --> 03:57.460]  the winking their eyes because at a biological level it's a beautiful woman
[03:57.460 --> 04:03.820]  winking at you and showing you that she wants to you know hook up with you it's
[04:03.820 --> 04:12.700]  it's all psychological warfare it's all inherently predatory by the globalist but
[04:12.700 --> 04:16.780]  it also just goes with our human instinct it's what we want to see we want to
[04:16.780 --> 04:22.900]  see attractive women in fact all the studies show that men and women want to
[04:22.900 --> 04:28.980]  watch attractive women it's no slight on women that aren't classically
[04:28.980 --> 04:33.340]  attractive it's just a scientific fact but I'm kind of digressing off into
[04:33.340 --> 04:37.900]  propaganda and deciphering it here when we come back it is another just
[04:37.900 --> 04:46.780]  overload of key intel the war on cash is heating up author Robert Devols is
[04:46.780 --> 04:52.700]  gonna vote libertarian senator wants to use the RICO act and arrest people that
[04:52.700 --> 05:00.660]  deny climate change it's all coming up I'm Alex Jones stay with us just passed
[05:00.660 --> 05:06.500]  by Congress the USA freedom act well not real freedom but the kind of freedom
[05:06.500 --> 05:12.340]  we act like we have in the USA think of it as SISPA for phone companies a kind
[05:12.340 --> 05:16.180]  of cozy symbiotic relationship between the corporate oligarchy and the
[05:16.180 --> 05:21.580]  authoritarian government the phone companies will now store your info and
[05:21.580 --> 05:25.620]  pass it on to the paranoid government on demand and the phone companies will be
[05:25.620 --> 05:30.700]  granted freedom from liability now that's real freedom the kind only the big
[05:30.700 --> 05:35.820]  guys get yeah but wait there's more now Congress will be notified whenever the
[05:35.820 --> 05:39.420]  secret files a court well it's not really a court just a single judge
[05:39.420 --> 05:46.300]  reinterprets the law that's great because they've been changing the law and not
[05:46.300 --> 05:52.900]  even telling us now they're gonna let us know is it America great the USA freedom

[08:29.740 --> 08:40.220]  NSA whistleblower an associate of Mr. Dirk Mr. Drake and others Mr. Benny will
[08:40.220 --> 08:46.260]  be joining us to break down the USA Freedom Act that passed Congress
[08:46.260 --> 08:51.100]  yesterday and was signed by the president he's part of the Institute for
[08:51.100 --> 08:57.380]  Public Accuracy we'll be talking to him coming up in the second hour to break
[08:57.380 --> 09:02.940]  this down but David Knight put together one of these info wars dot-com nuggets
[09:02.940 --> 09:08.780]  or bullets that we produce every single day and basically mix in as
[09:08.780 --> 09:15.860]  factoid news pieces into the advertisements that you hear played on
[09:15.860 --> 09:25.060]  the radio really boiled down in 60 seconds exactly what the USA Freedom Act
[09:25.060 --> 09:30.420]  actually does big industry has been complaining that they're not getting
[09:30.420 --> 09:38.020]  paid enough it's around nine million dollars a year on average by the federal
[09:38.020 --> 09:44.740]  government to store basically everything including your entire phone calls on the
[09:44.740 --> 09:52.900]  cloud and other systems and so it codifies into law and gives them cover
[09:52.900 --> 10:00.260]  to commit the criminal acts against their users against their customers and
[10:00.260 --> 10:06.180]  basically expands the Patriot Act radically and then by the time it gets
[10:06.180 --> 10:12.860]  spun into the media oh it's a reform it's a victory for Snowden it's a victory
[10:12.860 --> 10:20.580]  for Julian Assange on and on and on and I'm not trying to be negative here it's
[10:20.580 --> 10:24.740]  very positive we're having a national debate about this it's very positive
[10:24.740 --> 10:30.500]  that people are focused on it it's very positive that there's a debate about but
[10:30.500 --> 10:38.420]  you see how the flim flam works they're giving us foe or fake reform just like
[10:38.420 --> 10:41.860]  they take problems in health care and give us obama care that's five or six
[10:41.860 --> 10:48.660]  times worse more of the same a finagled boondoggle for the insurance companies
[10:48.660 --> 10:54.980]  to protect them while they double and triple prices and ration care and put
[10:54.980 --> 11:02.260]  bioethics boards and computers in control over medical decisions so it's a
[11:02.260 --> 11:08.380]  process I remember eight nine years ago the Bush administration pushed you know
[11:08.380 --> 11:14.660]  a privacy protection act and it actually made your records more accessible by big
[11:14.660 --> 11:18.300]  corporations and other groups and they had another piece of legislation to
[11:18.300 --> 11:22.140]  protect pension funds and it actually made it to work corporations can more
[11:22.140 --> 11:29.940]  easily steal your pension funds your private pension funds loot them and so
[11:29.940 --> 11:32.980]  once you've seen them do this a couple hundred times you kind of figure out
[11:32.980 --> 11:37.220]  their formulaic program and then if you ask why do they follow such simple
[11:37.220 --> 11:42.020]  formulae well for decades the mainstream media the dinosaur media the
[11:42.020 --> 11:49.580]  compliant accomplice media has in a solfistic way just parroted whatever
[11:49.580 --> 11:56.340]  they're told and gone along with this and that's how we've gotten to this
[11:56.340 --> 12:03.020]  point people ask why senator Warren is much more popular with Democrats hasn't
[12:03.020 --> 12:06.100]  run against Hillary yet it's because they'll blow her airplane up they'll
[12:06.100 --> 12:15.220]  kill her drudge tweeted and said you know what what cage they have her in well
[12:15.220 --> 12:20.460]  they've got her in the cage that the Democratic Party's a mafia and they've
[12:20.460 --> 12:26.180]  got this new guy running against Hillary I guarantee you that's a ringer that's
[12:26.180 --> 12:32.020]  how they roll folks I mean look they think we're so dumb they want to give us
[12:32.020 --> 12:36.100]  four administrations of the Clintons already because they run Obama make no
[12:36.100 --> 12:39.660]  mistake we've had four administrations of the Clintons and now they want a fifth
[12:39.660 --> 12:43.460]  or a sixth hey but don't worry the last administration of Reagan was basically
[12:43.460 --> 12:47.300]  run by George Herbert Walker Bush so he had two administrations and then George
[12:47.300 --> 12:50.620]  W had two administrations so that's four right there for the Bush dynasty now
[12:50.620 --> 12:57.100]  they want to give us the same guy again I mean fool me once shame on you fool me
[12:57.100 --> 13:05.420]  twice shame on me fool me three times stick a fork in us we're done but it
[13:05.420 --> 13:13.660]  shows the hubris and the arrogance of these people but singing in had this
[13:13.660 --> 13:16.380]  paradox this morning when I was checking seeing in to see what they were
[13:16.380 --> 13:23.380]  saying about the USA Freedom Act it's like robbing a bank in the cop shop you
[13:23.380 --> 13:26.780]  say but it's the USA Freedom Act or your vans red white and blue and you're
[13:26.780 --> 13:32.540]  wearing a Uncle Sam outfit you go stand down gentlemen it's freedom confetti
[13:32.540 --> 13:38.860]  shoots out of your hands it's just the ultimate con game it's all about the
[13:38.860 --> 13:45.540]  triumph of packaging and slogans over reality we're gonna go over what's in it
[13:45.540 --> 13:50.340]  but I was surprised to see articles on CNN saying big victory for Snowden big
[13:50.340 --> 13:54.980]  victory for Assange big victory for freedom oh this ends the illegal
[13:54.980 --> 13:59.780]  activities well I thought there wasn't any illegal activity going on see its
[13:59.780 --> 14:06.740]  lies within lies but here's the bigger lie it expands at all and here's CNN
[14:06.740 --> 14:10.180]  actually telling the truth blind hogs do find
[14:10.180 --> 14:15.420]  Akron's occasionally broken clocks are right twice a day thought bulk data
[14:15.420 --> 14:19.740]  collection was gone think again Jeremy Diamond wrote this piece the NSA is
[14:19.740 --> 14:23.100]  gearing up to collect millions of American cell phone metadata again but
[14:23.100 --> 14:27.740]  even that's a lie it's not metadata not just who you called the time and when
[14:27.740 --> 14:32.700]  and the time stamp they're recording the stinking phone calls 80% of them
[14:32.700 --> 14:36.780]  that's what whistleblowers have released the documents on they index
[14:36.780 --> 14:42.900]  everything maps of who you associate with and it's almost a diversion talking
[14:42.900 --> 14:48.820]  about government because corporations from Microsoft to Google to AT&T and the
[14:48.820 --> 14:57.420]  big telecoms to Samsung to Sony to you name it they're all making money off the
[14:57.420 --> 15:01.020]  microphones and cameras and they go it's okay because artificial intelligence
[15:01.020 --> 15:08.900]  collates it and then sends the data file to Samsung or other quote third party
[15:08.900 --> 15:13.660]  groups for analysis or purchase but then they admit they sometimes will sell if
[15:13.660 --> 15:18.820]  money people want to pay for the audio in your house in the video who do you
[15:18.820 --> 15:24.140]  think pays the government mainly nine billion a year last time I saw a
[15:24.140 --> 15:28.100]  congressional number then they classified that that was like in 2005 it
[15:28.100 --> 15:35.260]  was nine billion dollars that they'd paid in the previous year so it's 2004 you
[15:35.260 --> 15:42.100]  can look it up maybe the guys can and the gals can 2004 came out 2005 nine
[15:42.100 --> 15:48.060]  billion dollars where the government quote makes a request and AT&T goes
[15:48.060 --> 15:55.380]  sure that'll be $100 I'm like used to you got copies of your checks for free as
[15:55.380 --> 15:59.020]  you kept your money in the bank now most banks will charge you I was talking to
[15:59.020 --> 16:04.100]  a friend who wanted some of his checks they wanted to charge him $1400 for his
[16:04.100 --> 16:09.220]  last year of checks he hadn't even hardly written many he threatened to leave
[16:09.220 --> 16:15.180]  the bank they said we'll cut it in half 700 see once everything's digital folks
[16:15.180 --> 16:19.060]  you don't have a choice they can get rid of cash they can screw you over and
[16:19.060 --> 16:26.380]  that's in the news today as well so even when CNN tells the truth it is a
[16:26.380 --> 16:32.500]  addled blind groping attempt just two days after the agency shut down the
[16:32.500 --> 16:36.460]  program when the Patriot Act provision and authorized it expired Sunday at
[16:36.460 --> 16:41.740]  midnight the Senate restored those authorities allowing the government to
[16:41.740 --> 16:46.940]  reinstate bulk data collection for the next six months and it just goes on let's
[16:46.940 --> 16:54.100]  read what Scott Bomboy said and wrote at the National Constitution Center USA
[16:54.100 --> 17:00.660]  Freedom Act signed so what's next NSA spying the act passed the Senate 67 yes
[17:00.660 --> 17:04.980]  votes signed by Obama on the surface the USA Freedom Act curtailes but doesn't end
[17:04.980 --> 17:08.620]  the government's ability to get phone meditated records for American citizens
[17:08.620 --> 17:12.980]  and others after six month transition period the USA Freedom Act shifts the
[17:12.980 --> 17:16.500]  burden of keeping the phone records to private companies oh that's even worse
[17:16.500 --> 17:21.540]  and the NSA must get individualized permissions from the secret FISA court
[17:21.540 --> 17:25.100]  to get relevant targeted information from a phone company storing the records
[17:25.100 --> 17:29.700]  it also provides for an adversarial advocate in the secret FISA court and
[17:29.700 --> 17:35.460]  the release of certain FISA court decisions publicly the Freedom Act also
[17:35.460 --> 17:39.340]  restores a roving wiretap provision and lone wolf provision of the Patriot Act
[17:39.340 --> 17:46.100]  folks they never followed the Patriot Act to begin with as Rand Paul said in a
[17:46.100 --> 17:51.540]  speech that they already just recorded all this is all a joke they did they use
[17:51.540 --> 17:55.700]  the FISA court in something like one tenth of one percent of the cases when
[17:55.700 --> 17:59.700]  they wanted to actually prosecute somebody they would engage in structuring a
[17:59.700 --> 18:06.220]  fraudulent conversion for the court that they call basically parallel
[18:06.220 --> 18:10.700]  construction where they then go and create a case acting like they started
[18:10.700 --> 18:14.860]  the investigation from constitutional means when they'd already built the case
[18:14.860 --> 18:23.540]  using illegal total spying systems I'm gonna go to break here with again this
[18:23.540 --> 18:27.540]  David Knight piece he just filed this morning in 60 seconds he tells it all
[18:27.540 --> 18:35.100]  he explains it all here is just passed by Congress the USA Freedom Act well not
[18:35.100 --> 18:40.260]  real freedom but the kind of freedom we act like we have in the USA think of it
[18:40.260 --> 18:45.140]  as syspa for phone companies a kind of cozy symbiotic relationship between the

[24:43.740 --> 24:47.940]  like they've called for in Europe boy these are really liberal people we don't
[24:47.940 --> 24:53.260]  want to pay a carbon tax to the UN and Al Gore how bold of Al Gore to own one of

[25:23.620 --> 25:27.620]  that's from the New York Times that's coming up in the next segment but
[25:27.620 --> 25:32.380]  getting back into the USA Freedom Act what an or welling in ridiculous over
[25:32.380 --> 25:37.460]  the top name a fraud wrapped in a live wrapped in another scam deployed by the
[25:37.460 --> 25:43.700]  mainstream media we have Mitch McConnell the leader of the Senate running
[25:43.700 --> 25:48.740]  around saying there is no illegal spine your rights are not being violated the
[25:48.740 --> 25:55.180]  same thing Marco Rubio saying this is really a battle right now between the
[25:55.180 --> 26:02.660]  forces of deception the forces of truth and will lies and outright con artistry
[26:02.660 --> 26:09.300]  that up is down and down is up and black is white and and left is right will this
[26:09.300 --> 26:13.580]  be the victory of these fraudsters because we've had dozens and dozens of
[26:13.580 --> 26:17.460]  whistleblowers from the NSA go public we have the actual NSA documents and
[26:17.460 --> 26:21.860]  schematics about how they're spiraling everything big corporations are doing it
[26:21.860 --> 26:26.940]  and then they just get up there and say no one's violating your rights nothing's
[26:26.940 --> 26:31.740]  happening move along where'd you get these droids these aren't the droids
[26:31.740 --> 26:39.820]  you're looking for move along move along I mean are we that dumb here is Mitch
[26:39.820 --> 26:45.660]  McConnell trying to be Obi-Wan Kenobi but he's not a good guy so I guess it's
[26:45.660 --> 26:50.500]  trying to be Darth Vader here it is and so today the Senate will vote on whether
[26:50.500 --> 26:56.340]  or not we should take one more tool away from those who defend this country
[26:56.340 --> 27:03.620]  every day the ability of a trained analyst under exceedingly close
[27:03.620 --> 27:09.620]  supervision and only with the approval of the foreign intelligence surveillance
[27:09.620 --> 27:18.500]  court to query a database of call data records based on reasonable articulable
[27:18.500 --> 27:27.260]  suspicion no content no names no listening to phone calls of law-abiding
[27:27.260 --> 27:37.260]  citizens none of that is going on we're talking about call data records
[27:37.260 --> 27:43.660]  man and these are the providers records which is not what the fourth
[27:43.660 --> 27:47.940]  amendment speaks to all right let's stop right there no it's your personal
[27:47.940 --> 27:52.700]  papers and effects this is how lawyers scam you they get to focus in on one
[27:52.700 --> 27:59.260]  little area about metadata and then claim that they're not spying on anybody
[27:59.260 --> 28:05.140]  outside of that when it's on record they are in fact anybody can type in NSA
[28:05.140 --> 28:11.820]  spied on Senate CIA spied on Senate CIA broke into Senate computers beyond what
[28:11.820 --> 28:17.740]  Nixon did with the plumbers you can type in the MI6 blackmailing parliament all
[28:17.740 --> 28:23.140]  these governments are doing it of course these politicos want access to this
[28:23.140 --> 28:27.140]  even though it's bringing them down the Patriot Act was used to go after
[28:27.140 --> 28:32.980]  Hastert as as disgusting as Hastert is and I mean I'm he fits the bill at one
[28:32.980 --> 28:38.420]  of these pedos got to say he's innocent till proven guilty still it's not a
[28:38.420 --> 28:44.860]  terrorist I mean you don't suspend his constitutional rights to catch him and
[28:44.860 --> 28:50.660]  the argument is well we got him really it's better that ten guilty men go free
[28:50.660 --> 28:54.740]  than one innocent man go to prison I mean this has been done before in
[28:54.740 --> 29:00.540]  history where used to spend due process and it creates hell on earth every
[29:00.540 --> 29:10.260]  single time so remember they they denied there was any NSA spying before
[29:10.260 --> 29:17.020]  remember that and now they had to walk it back to go okay there is but but there
[29:17.020 --> 29:21.220]  isn't like they just found an article there about spying on Congress spying
[29:21.220 --> 29:25.500]  on members of the US Congress DOJ tap congressional rooms as well as reporters
[29:25.500 --> 29:30.740]  offices that's right they even went and hid microphones in the cloakroom and the
[29:30.740 --> 29:35.780]  break room of the senators without Lawrence the Justice Department stuck
[29:35.780 --> 29:42.780]  microphones in private areas of the Capitol wiretapping hardcore felonies
[29:42.780 --> 29:47.460]  this is the same group that ship guns into Mexico okay I mean that's the type
[29:47.460 --> 29:53.860]  of stuff going on here we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones
[29:53.860 --> 29:57.700]  and the GCN radio network
[30:00.020 --> 30:05.220]  Rhode Island senator Sheldon Whitehouse just seriously suggested that people who
[30:05.220 --> 30:08.980]  are skeptical of global warming models and predictions should not only be
[30:08.980 --> 30:14.460]  censored but prosecuted under the RICO Act that's the racketeer influenced and
[30:14.460 --> 30:19.900]  corrupt organizations act of 1970 you know going after organized crime the
[30:19.900 --> 30:23.260]  government was having trouble getting convictions for organized crime because
[30:23.260 --> 30:26.620]  the mob could always hire the best lawyers so they decided they'd take
[30:26.620 --> 30:30.780]  away their money first so they could get a conviction but when you take away
[30:30.780 --> 30:36.220]  constitutional rights for the mob you take them away for everyone within 16
[30:36.220 --> 30:40.580]  years Reagan signed civil asset forfeiture laws that allowed the police to
[30:40.580 --> 30:46.140]  confiscate property even without charging you with a crime by 1994 RICO was
[30:46.140 --> 30:50.780]  being used against pro-life activists so it's not a stretch that this
[30:50.780 --> 30:55.820]  government would use RICO against people who are skeptical of its agenda for

[33:15.860 --> 33:42.620]  listening to alex jones gas mask
[33:42.620 --> 33:56.740]  I want to get back into the whole in a safe situation is we have a major
[33:56.740 --> 34:01.500]  whistleblower joining us coming up but you've also got other activities going
[34:01.500 --> 34:12.060]  on step bladder the head of the worldwide FIF a soccer system has now resigned
[34:12.060 --> 34:16.860]  they've arrested dozens of people it is a 40-something people and it's our
[34:16.860 --> 34:22.780]  government acting as a global government and it's almost bizarre that they would
[34:22.780 --> 34:28.740]  be engaged in economic warfare to get the World Cup to the US set of Russia but
[34:28.740 --> 34:33.780]  it's not even being done for us interest that would be still villainous but not as
[34:33.780 --> 34:38.660]  bad as the fact they do everything they can to make sure that the United States
[34:38.660 --> 34:43.020]  doesn't have industry doesn't have jobs and is dependent on globalism but these
[34:43.020 --> 34:47.460]  politicians wanted here because they want the payoffs they want the graft they
[34:47.460 --> 34:53.180]  want the world stage for themselves to project themselves into global government
[34:53.180 --> 34:58.980]  positions these are the most narcissistic peacock like people you can imagine and
[34:58.980 --> 35:06.020]  I'm not defending the FIF a and all of its obvious historical corruption but
[35:06.020 --> 35:12.220]  it's a private global soccer system it's their business the United States has no
[35:12.220 --> 35:18.900]  business when we have incredibly corrupt sports system I mean probably one of the
[35:18.900 --> 35:25.860]  most corrupt in the world we don't have any business being involved in this the
[35:25.860 --> 35:34.980]  FBI arresting a bunch of people in Switzerland at a FIF a convention and
[35:34.980 --> 35:39.540]  now it's this big distraction meanwhile we have the Justice Department engaged
[35:39.540 --> 35:43.700]  in basically every crime under the Sun and not getting in trouble setting the
[35:43.700 --> 35:48.260]  precedent for even more of that in the future I mean it is scary so that's just
[35:48.260 --> 35:53.180]  one of the articles I have here in the stack let me just give you the headlines
[35:53.180 --> 35:59.060]  here George W. Bush out pulls Barack Obama wiki leaks offers a hundred
[35:59.060 --> 36:05.900]  thousand dollar bounty for Asian trade pack published and pushed by Obama so
[36:05.900 --> 36:09.220]  they're offering a hundred thousand dollar bounty for Asia trade pack to be
[36:09.220 --> 36:16.100]  published and what I understood was wiki leaks was has the whole thing and so
[36:16.100 --> 36:20.340]  they're just fundraising saying give us money and we'll release it but by the
[36:20.340 --> 36:25.740]  time it hits Reuters they're acting like wiki leaks is saying we've got a bounty
[36:25.740 --> 36:29.860]  out to get the rest of it so I went back this morning and looked and found
[36:29.860 --> 36:34.420]  articles saying wiki leaks has it and chose to leak the subsections on the
[36:34.420 --> 36:40.820]  internet so I'm confused because I've called for a signs to release at all but
[36:40.820 --> 36:44.180]  maybe maybe he never got it all maybe that was a mistake in the media I don't
[36:44.180 --> 36:49.620]  know a signs needs to clarify that because I still haven't decided if I
[36:49.620 --> 36:54.100]  trust him or not we know in the war between corporations and governments and
[36:54.100 --> 36:59.260]  other corporations kind of that trifecta again corporations and government
[36:59.260 --> 37:02.900]  waging war corporations waging war with other corporations within that
[37:02.900 --> 37:07.860]  triangle the separation of powers that's still there even trying to
[37:07.860 --> 37:12.620]  circumvent it the founders just put separation of powers in very clearly so
[37:12.620 --> 37:17.980]  that you never get too much power in one branch within those competing factors
[37:17.980 --> 37:20.820]  that are out there that thank God they're there that's what restrains
[37:20.820 --> 37:29.020]  tyranny from just absolutely taking over everything within that wiki leaks is
[37:29.020 --> 37:36.820]  undoubtedly releasing things that tend to favor Google and tend to favor key
[37:36.820 --> 37:41.820]  globalist corporations that are vying to be the global government see all these
[37:41.820 --> 37:45.140]  corporations are pushing global government because whether it's Exxon
[37:45.140 --> 37:50.220]  mobile or whether it's Walmart or whether it's Apple or whether it's IBM or
[37:50.220 --> 37:58.060]  whether it's Microsoft or Google or whether it is Miller brewing they're
[37:58.060 --> 38:01.540]  all on these globalist boards they all get more power out of the global
[38:01.540 --> 38:06.860]  government getting more power because they set it up they're like a ring
[38:06.860 --> 38:11.100]  race who serve the one ring and they all think magically that they're gonna end up
[38:11.100 --> 38:17.660]  being the head honcho one day they all lust after the ring seeking it so to
[38:17.660 --> 38:20.860]  understand the global power structure that's what you've got to get in their
[38:20.860 --> 38:24.620]  mindset because even though they can get burned by it even though they can get
[38:24.620 --> 38:30.700]  run over by it they're all pooling their power into it because they already get
[38:30.700 --> 38:35.580]  increased power out of it and as its power increases the more wildly the more
[38:35.580 --> 38:39.820]  laissez faire they get about tyranny and the more arrogant they get and the more
[38:39.820 --> 38:46.060]  they get away with the more insane they get the more powerless they get
[38:46.060 --> 38:54.540]  heard of wanderlust what about powerless it's called megalomania hedge fund
[38:54.540 --> 38:59.660]  muggle Paulson gives Harvard a record 400 million donation it's all part of
[38:59.660 --> 39:04.260]  the mafia that then sends out the people to write the regs in government so
[39:04.260 --> 39:08.900]  that's a protection payment actor Robert Duvall says he may vote for Rand Paul
[39:08.900 --> 39:16.220]  that's up on info wars.com maybe the THX 1138 star says Native American
[39:16.220 --> 39:20.900]  students sues to wear eagle feather at graduation you can wear a Harry Potter
[39:20.900 --> 39:26.100]  shirt but you can't wear that because it's seen as religious hey you can wear
[39:26.100 --> 39:30.580]  whatever you want as long as it's your own private religious expression you can
[39:30.580 --> 39:37.340]  talk about Christ if you want or you can promote Bathomet if you want unless
[39:37.340 --> 39:41.980]  it's in the the rules of the school that you can't have any logos but once
[39:41.980 --> 39:45.940]  you're graduating in a separate free speech event it's been held by courts
[39:45.940 --> 39:49.580]  you do have that right but it just shows the mindset of these people there's
[39:49.580 --> 39:59.660]  another one here space invaders feminist neuter male and now people are
[39:59.660 --> 40:02.740]  actually being arrested for male spreading if you open your legs more
[40:02.740 --> 40:08.460]  than three inches you are arrested in New York so the feminist Nazis to use a
[40:08.460 --> 40:16.180]  rush limbo term feminazi they put the edict out the police act people say
[40:16.180 --> 40:20.580]  why does everybody follow their orders because the state is teaching them they
[40:20.580 --> 40:25.500]  have power not individually but to carry out the mandate to create divide and
[40:25.500 --> 40:34.140]  conquer strategies speaking of tyranny senator says use racketeering laws that's
[40:34.140 --> 40:38.900]  anti-organized crime laws to prosecute global warming skeptics that's right a
[40:38.900 --> 40:43.900]  sitting u.s. senator is suggesting using RICO laws and should be applied to
[40:43.900 --> 40:48.660]  global warming skeptics is from the weekly standard mark Hemingway reporting
[40:48.660 --> 40:52.740]  writing in the Washington Post Sheldon Whitehouse a Democratic senator from
[40:52.740 --> 40:56.780]  Rhode Island offered a curious suggestion for dealing with global warming
[40:56.780 --> 41:00.580]  skeptics it's not curious this is the they're actually arresting people now in
[41:00.580 --> 41:08.340]  Europe and trying to do it in the UK doesn't matter the satellite say it's
[41:08.340 --> 41:11.980]  getting cooler it doesn't matter what all the evidence shows it doesn't matter
[41:11.980 --> 41:15.580]  that the northern ice cap got bigger Al Gore said to be gone by two years ago in
[41:15.580 --> 41:20.420]  2006 he said to be gone by 2013 it doesn't matter that they change from ice
[41:20.420 --> 41:26.100]  ages coming to global warmings coming up by the 80s and 90s to now any climate
[41:26.100 --> 41:30.580]  change is humans and is going to kill us but the climate's always changing well
[41:30.580 --> 41:35.260]  that's an arrestable offense they claim that because I get up here and say this
[41:35.260 --> 41:39.060]  I'm part of an organized crime group being paid by oil companies really which
[41:39.060 --> 41:45.380]  ones Exxon mobile BP British petroleum of course and Dutch roll shell and others
[41:45.380 --> 41:51.780]  are the main givers after Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan they're the number three
[41:51.780 --> 41:58.700]  four five and six donors to the whole global warming shake down fiasco it's
[41:58.700 --> 42:01.780]  like Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson going around so we're gonna call your
[42:01.780 --> 42:05.260]  company racist if you don't make a million dollar donation to us and you
[42:05.260 --> 42:09.380]  know his daughter stepped in a crack in New York sidewalk and is suing saying it
[42:09.380 --> 42:12.900]  blew out her knee and then she's caught on video and photos and puts on her own
[42:12.900 --> 42:21.780]  Facebook are climbing mountains looks like a mountain go to and I need to be
[42:21.780 --> 42:24.820]  irreverent but I just do that now to just let the feminists know I have first
[42:24.820 --> 42:29.220]  amendment I used to be chivalrous about that but see they've used our Western
[42:29.220 --> 42:33.460]  chivalry against us the so-called left-handed care radical Islamists
[42:33.460 --> 42:38.020]  kill Christians and sexually mutilate women put them into sex slavery they
[42:38.020 --> 42:41.940]  defend them they love it as cute and foreign and sexy because it's different
[42:41.940 --> 42:47.300]  in the West but then the West where women's rights came from where they were
[42:47.300 --> 42:52.460]  pushed where slavery was ended worldwide by the West we get the blame for
[42:52.460 --> 42:58.660]  ending at all they take our chivalry and they throw vomit all over it with hate
[42:58.660 --> 43:04.860]  because they see us as weak men who built the civilization with our women as a
[43:04.860 --> 43:10.820]  human unit as a team they see us as weak and impact and they want to dominate us
[43:10.820 --> 43:15.860]  as usurpers they are women who are married to the eugenics state they are
[43:15.860 --> 43:21.860]  married to the cult of death in fact can you guys queue up I kill my kids
[43:21.860 --> 43:27.260]  please from the rally a week and a half ago against killing 51% of the black
[43:27.260 --> 43:30.100]  people in the country that have been killed 51% of black people were never
[43:30.100 --> 43:39.220]  born they were erased how how poignant and saddening is that since 1974 and we
[43:39.220 --> 43:44.260]  just went out to say hey black lives matter don't abort any of the babies
[43:44.260 --> 43:49.300]  and so we were descended upon by what could only be described as reeking
[43:49.300 --> 44:00.220]  scruffulous demonic protuberances sticking up out of the caves they
[44:00.220 --> 44:04.860]  they slithered out of then one of them went and jumped in a dumpster and hit it
[44:04.860 --> 44:10.780]  I mean you can't make up the filth crawling back from whence it came I
[44:11.420 --> 44:18.260]  kill my kids you guys can just type in like Alex Jones assaulted by a
[44:18.260 --> 44:23.780]  communist and then it's it's in that video it's on YouTube I think I'm gonna
[44:23.780 --> 44:28.580]  have a promo with those in fact in fact it's in the promo we've got that
[44:28.580 --> 44:33.180]  jacari Jackson put together the A-Team let's just play that you can queue that
[44:33.180 --> 44:41.100]  up the abortion team I think the actual title of the video is abortionist the
[44:41.100 --> 44:47.220]  devil or spurs but I just pulled up right here for it now continuing ladies
[44:47.220 --> 44:54.420]  and gentlemen this is the senator writing in the Washington Post in 2006
[44:54.420 --> 44:59.940]  judge Gladys Kessler of the US district court for the district of Columbia
[44:59.940 --> 45:04.900]  decided the tobacco companies fraudulent campaign amounted to racketeering
[45:04.900 --> 45:08.460]  enterprise according to the court defendants coordinated significant
[45:08.460 --> 45:12.260]  aspects of their public relations scientific legal and marketing activity
[45:12.260 --> 45:15.860]  the furtherance of a shared objective to maximize industry profits are
[45:15.860 --> 45:19.500]  preserving and expanding the market for cigarettes through a scheme to deceive
[45:19.500 --> 45:25.180]  the public the tobacco companies for 60-something years added hundreds of
[45:25.180 --> 45:29.100]  additives to make it more addictive they did hire fake scientists to cover it up
[45:29.100 --> 45:34.220]  they did engage in media campaigns that's what the global warming people are
[45:34.220 --> 45:40.220]  doing or the climate change people now is they got caught hiding a decline they
[45:40.220 --> 45:45.180]  got caught organizing how to hide temperature declines that's the word
[45:45.180 --> 45:50.220]  hide the decline at the Anglia University running at worldwide putting the
[45:50.220 --> 45:53.620]  marching orders out they got caught hiding their carbon treaty that would
[45:53.620 --> 45:58.740]  basically double taxes on the third world and be a death sentence they got
[45:58.740 --> 46:03.380]  caught they got caught and then the oil companies are doing this they want to
[46:03.380 --> 46:07.540]  shut down their competition they want to shut down coal oils biggest competition
[46:07.540 --> 46:15.060]  is coal folks this is about shutting coal off I own no coal stock but coal none of
[46:15.060 --> 46:21.540]  my family does but coal coal clean burning coal is one of the best energies
[46:21.540 --> 46:27.420]  we've got we can make gasoline out of it cleaner burning than what we've got we
[46:27.420 --> 46:31.660]  could shut Saudi Arabia down right now we got 300 years of coal just in Texas
[46:31.660 --> 46:35.300]  300 years of leg night
[46:35.900 --> 46:40.260]  see my problem is I know what I'm talking about they just want to call us
[46:40.260 --> 46:45.700]  criminals and he goes on to say the parallels between that and global warming
[46:45.700 --> 46:49.540]  and climate change deniers are clear and he goes on to say we should be
[46:49.540 --> 46:56.860]  indicted these are the totalitarians we deal with let's go ahead though and
[46:56.860 --> 47:01.780]  just show you really in my experience and this happened at the Capitol with
[47:01.780 --> 47:08.100]  women who weren't dressed in in in basically all all black you know women
[47:08.100 --> 47:12.260]  just spontaneously with other women praying at the Capitol to try to ban
[47:12.260 --> 47:16.020]  partial birth abortion a few years ago the women sort of running up saying
[47:16.020 --> 47:20.860]  Hail Satan Hail Satan and just sort of just chanting and it was like Buddhist
[47:20.860 --> 47:28.620]  monks or something you hear the audio it doesn't translate well on radio
[47:28.620 --> 47:32.180]  because it resonates so I you can watch it online it was on the news it was just
[47:32.180 --> 47:38.780]  Satan because I mean Satan wants these babies this is a and then the women
[47:38.780 --> 47:42.660]  were just channeling their love of death we understand so here is the abortion
[47:42.660 --> 47:59.740]  team done done done done done done done I kill my kids I kill my kids you know
[47:59.740 --> 48:04.260]  what that's so good so so informative let's let's let's start it over with
[48:04.260 --> 48:08.940]  Darren McBreen's intro to the piece I want to play the full piece as we get
[48:08.940 --> 48:14.580]  ready to go to break here is the abortion team in today's world abortion
[48:14.580 --> 48:19.940]  supporters routinely attend pro-life rallies and attempt to bully activists
[48:19.940 --> 48:26.500]  if you have a problem and need a smelly group of commie devil worshipers maybe
[48:26.500 --> 48:44.500]  you can call the 18 I kill my kids I kill my kids we saw your Facebook with
[48:44.500 --> 48:49.220]  your communist hammer and sickle that's pretty cool man is that you on the
[48:49.220 --> 48:55.700]  Facebook is there a Facebook page of you with a hammer and sickle I don't think
[48:55.700 --> 49:03.780]  so
[49:05.100 --> 49:12.580]  I pay for them
[49:15.940 --> 49:22.360]  He's a bunch of misogynist mother take your mill privilege somewhere out
[49:22.360 --> 49:23.560]  that you're being aggressive.
[49:23.560 --> 49:24.680]  I'm being aggressive.
[49:24.680 --> 49:25.920]  Come on, Alex!
[49:25.920 --> 49:26.920]  Excuse us!
[49:26.920 --> 49:27.720]  Hey, what's up?
[49:27.720 --> 49:28.220]  What's up?
[49:28.220 --> 49:29.520]  What's up?
[49:29.520 --> 49:32.880]  These sex thing guys that attack Alex Jones.
[49:40.880 --> 49:44.680]  From the front lines of the Information War,
[49:44.680 --> 49:46.480]  it's Alex Jones.
[49:46.480 --> 49:48.080]  I just thought I'd air that because I don't
[49:48.080 --> 49:50.480]  have nude listeners every day, every minute,
[49:50.480 --> 49:52.120]  and they hear me claiming there's women running
[49:52.120 --> 49:54.800]  around the streets of Austin going, hell, Satan.
[49:54.800 --> 49:56.320]  There you go.
[49:56.320 --> 49:58.080]  And if you go to the Capitol or anywhere,
[49:58.080 --> 50:00.120]  and it'll be straight, lace-looking women,
[50:00.120 --> 50:02.440]  you go, you know, I really think we shouldn't kill
[50:02.440 --> 50:06.360]  eight-month-old babies, and they'll just go, Satan.
[50:06.360 --> 50:08.520]  You're like, they'll start attacking you
[50:08.520 --> 50:12.760]  and just grabbing your signs and throwing them down.
[50:12.760 --> 50:15.240]  And it's like, whoa!
[50:15.240 --> 50:17.040]  Because they don't have any personalities.
[50:17.040 --> 50:18.640]  They weren't brought up by loving parents.
[50:18.640 --> 50:20.160]  They'd been sat in front of a television.
[50:20.160 --> 50:21.640]  Their soul's gone.
[50:21.640 --> 50:23.320]  And I guess just interdimensionally,
[50:23.320 --> 50:26.960]  because there's a vacancy in their body,
[50:26.960 --> 50:29.360]  something comes into them.
[50:29.360 --> 50:31.800]  Like a galactic body snatcher.
[50:31.800 --> 50:32.720]  I mean, I don't know.
[50:35.880 --> 50:41.040]  But just think, the good Lord, I don't have those entities in me.
[50:41.040 --> 50:46.200]  Boy, I tell you, they always stick their tongues down.
[50:46.200 --> 50:51.040]  They just really, that's the universal, I love it.
[50:51.040 --> 50:53.560]  Yeah, you're gonna love dying with cancer.
[50:53.560 --> 50:55.800]  You're gonna love getting put in that pine box.
[50:55.800 --> 50:58.360]  You're gonna love nobody there to care about you when you're dying.
[50:58.360 --> 51:28.320]  Those of you that love death, boy, you're in for it.

[54:00.600 --> 54:05.600]  ["Many Times Been Biddened, Many Times Been Biddened"]
[54:07.520 --> 54:09.120]  Alex Jones here by Clive.
[54:09.120 --> 54:10.440]  You know, I just mentioned this off
[54:10.440 --> 54:13.360]  from the top of my head about 30 minutes ago.
[54:13.360 --> 54:15.560]  Just from memory, when I was talking about the NSA
[54:15.560 --> 54:20.400]  and this ridiculous USA Freedom Act that just makes it worse,
[54:20.400 --> 54:21.880]  and just legalizes corporations
[54:21.880 --> 54:23.800]  doing what they're already doing spying on us
[54:23.800 --> 54:26.200]  for and with their counterparts
[54:26.200 --> 54:28.120]  that they've put in government.
[54:28.120 --> 54:32.000]  Just make no mistake, it's a corporate takeover of government.
[54:32.000 --> 54:36.400]  DEA eavesdropping tripled bypass federal courts,
[54:36.400 --> 54:40.320]  USA Today, and they just admit
[54:40.320 --> 54:43.040]  what's been unknown for 30-something years.
[54:43.040 --> 54:45.560]  That they listened to everything, it's all recorded,
[54:45.560 --> 54:48.880]  and the DEA has more access to the computers,
[54:48.880 --> 54:53.160]  basically, that the NSA has stored the data on
[54:53.160 --> 54:55.320]  than the NSA does.
[54:56.320 --> 54:58.080]  That's why William Benny kept trying to go,
[54:58.080 --> 55:00.040]  we need to know who's on the system,
[55:00.040 --> 55:02.320]  why can't we set up monitoring of the NSA?
[55:02.320 --> 55:04.160]  And they go, no, no one's allowed to know
[55:04.160 --> 55:05.720]  who's getting into the database,
[55:05.720 --> 55:08.360]  because it's a system to bring America down.
[55:08.360 --> 55:10.360]  They put a system in to spy on everything,
[55:10.360 --> 55:12.080]  and then give it to foreign governments,
[55:12.080 --> 55:14.440]  select corporations, and other globalists.
[55:14.440 --> 55:18.600]  Which makes them basically invincible.
[55:20.440 --> 55:21.800]  If they're allowed to continue to operate,
[55:21.800 --> 55:23.640]  because they've got full data control,
[55:23.640 --> 55:24.960]  they can steal anything,
[55:24.960 --> 55:27.320]  they can always be three steps ahead of everybody,
[55:27.320 --> 55:28.760]  they can find out when whistleblowers
[55:28.760 --> 55:30.680]  are about to go public, and go after them.
[55:30.680 --> 55:32.960]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[55:32.960 --> 55:34.280]  And the crooks that have taken over
[55:34.280 --> 55:35.520]  don't wanna get rid of this,
[55:35.520 --> 55:37.960]  because it's so flaming illegal.
[55:37.960 --> 55:41.800]  They wanna have Mitch McConnell, and Rubio, and Bobo,
[55:41.800 --> 55:44.520]  and all the rest of them get up there,
[55:44.520 --> 55:46.880]  and tell us that there is no illegal spying,
[55:46.880 --> 55:48.920]  they're just, it's preposterous.
[55:50.880 --> 55:52.480]  It reminds me of Gibbs,
[55:52.480 --> 55:55.120]  the former press secretary for Obozo.
[55:57.760 --> 55:59.760]  Well, he didn't know Obozo was killing the country,
[55:59.760 --> 56:02.760]  Mr. Effective, Mr. Assassin of Freedom,
[56:02.760 --> 56:04.560]  Mr. Frontman of the Globalist,
[56:04.560 --> 56:05.400]  and he gets up there and goes,
[56:05.400 --> 56:07.080]  well, you know, the drone program's admitted to exist,
[56:07.080 --> 56:08.720]  and they're killing people for years,
[56:08.720 --> 56:11.200]  and I was told to get up on TV and say it didn't exist,
[56:11.200 --> 56:13.480]  and it's kind of hard to do that when it's known to exist.
[56:13.480 --> 56:14.520]  But I did it.
[56:14.520 --> 56:15.600]  You know, paying no attention to the man
[56:15.600 --> 56:17.640]  behind the curtain, close quote.
[56:17.640 --> 56:19.120]  That's what they're doing.
[56:19.120 --> 56:21.120]  But it's in the USA today
[56:21.120 --> 56:24.080]  that the DEA's doing all this without warrants.
[56:25.640 --> 56:27.600]  I mean, this is just redonkulous.
[56:29.680 --> 56:31.740]  Absolutely ridiculous.
[56:33.040 --> 56:35.600]  Coming up, Tone Deaf Clinton campaign
[56:35.600 --> 56:38.200]  throws kids off playground, New York Post.
[56:38.200 --> 56:41.240]  This is the type of story that gets people's attention.
[56:41.240 --> 56:44.400]  Economist says financial elites fear-provoking bank runs
[56:44.400 --> 56:45.560]  prepare to ban cash.
[56:45.560 --> 56:48.400]  Bilderberg's about to meet to try to ram that through.
[56:48.400 --> 56:50.040]  I've got part of the Bilderberg agenda.
[56:50.040 --> 56:51.040]  I'm just waiting to publish,
[56:51.040 --> 56:54.000]  I need to talk to Watson and give him my sources
[56:54.000 --> 56:55.200]  and what I've been told.
[56:57.120 --> 57:00.560]  School, kitchen manager fired from Colorado School
[57:00.560 --> 57:03.040]  for giving hungry students free lunches,
[57:03.040 --> 57:05.160]  but it's okay to have foreign banks rape everybody
[57:05.160 --> 57:07.240]  and steal the pension funds.
[57:07.240 --> 57:10.280]  It's all coming up in the second hour today.
[57:10.280 --> 57:12.340]  I am rampaging for freedom.
[57:14.320 --> 57:18.080]  I am upset about being usurped and enslaved and nominated
[57:18.080 --> 57:19.800]  and I'm here trying to rally free humanity
[57:19.800 --> 57:22.000]  to say no to this takeover.
[57:22.000 --> 57:25.160]  Briefly, folks really love their survival shield,
[57:25.160 --> 57:28.600]  nice and eye-dye next to from infowarslife.com.
[57:29.520 --> 57:31.800]  The bad halogens are put in the food and water,
[57:31.800 --> 57:33.640]  they fill up the thyroid and other glands
[57:33.640 --> 57:36.720]  and just devastate normal human activity that's admitted.
[57:36.720 --> 57:39.160]  When the feds ordered it, put in salt in the 20s,
[57:39.160 --> 57:40.800]  IQs went up 15 points.
[57:40.800 --> 57:43.960]  Just Google, iodine made the IQ go up 15 points
[57:43.960 --> 57:45.760]  and it'll come up mainstream news.
[57:45.760 --> 57:48.760]  International Business Times, AP, you name it.
[57:48.760 --> 57:51.040]  But that's the standard iodine
[57:51.040 --> 57:53.200]  that's basically bound to other elements
[57:53.200 --> 57:54.300]  and isn't very absorbable.
[57:54.300 --> 57:57.640]  We have the true crystal pure form 999 plus
[57:57.640 --> 58:00.240]  from Deep Earth Sources, nobody else has.
[58:00.240 --> 58:02.000]  And what it's done for me, my family,
[58:02.000 --> 58:03.320]  you've heard the right reviews,
[58:03.320 --> 58:06.400]  it's the missing link, the turbocharger,
[58:06.400 --> 58:08.000]  it's just incredible.
[58:08.000 --> 58:12.840]  Infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com
[58:12.840 --> 58:15.920]  or 888-2533139.
[58:15.920 --> 58:18.160]  And it's gonna sell out actually in five, six days,
[58:18.160 --> 58:19.600]  not two weeks, like I said,
[58:19.600 --> 58:21.400]  because folks have paid attention to the fact
[58:21.400 --> 58:22.960]  that we're running out of it,
[58:22.960 --> 58:25.040]  it could be months till we get more
[58:25.040 --> 58:28.040]  because the manufacturing process is so complicated
[58:28.040 --> 58:30.660]  and it's mined and that source isn't sure either.
[58:30.660 --> 58:32.840]  So I don't think it's gonna happen,
[58:32.840 --> 58:34.680]  but it could be the end of X2,
[58:34.680 --> 58:36.600]  we'll have to go back to original survival shield.
[58:36.600 --> 58:38.360]  There was a game changer as well.

[59:20.080 --> 59:22.240]  Alex Jones here, for the last two years,

[59:24.760 --> 59:27.960]  and chemist to design a nutraceutical formulation
[59:27.960 --> 59:30.320]  that has truly life-changing health benefits.

[59:55.720 --> 01:00:00.720]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:12.640]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:14.160]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:18.320]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:25.320]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:31.160]  NSA whistleblower Kirk Wiebe is going to be joining us
[01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:36.880]  from accuracy.org and expose facts.org.
[01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:38.840]  Colleague of William Benny, former director
[01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:40.520]  of the technical division of the NSA
[01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:42.760]  and the inventor of much of this stuff.
[01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:44.920]  He's been right here in the studio, amazing patriot,
[01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:48.840]  amazing person of courage.
[01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:53.840]  We've got really important news coming up on the issue of TPP.
[01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:58.680]  I want to hit that in a moment.
[01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:02.160]  But first, I mentioned this earlier in the last hour,
[01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:07.160]  the war on free speech intensifying in this country.
[01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:09.520]  But also the war on men.
[01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:11.680]  There's a special report on Infowars.com.
[01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:15.960]  Two men have been arrested in New York for man-spreading.
[01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:19.600]  If you open your legs, like I'm doing right now,
[01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:21.280]  even just a few inches, you will be arrested.
[01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:24.200]  That's after feminists called for it.
[01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:27.640]  And in a tyranny, they teach you that clamoring masses
[01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:32.120]  must be worshiped as long as it creates infighting.
[01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:36.360]  And that ties into the claims that if you're a valovictorian
[01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:38.960]  or someone giving a speech, the class president
[01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:43.960]  or whatever at a commencement or at a graduation,
[01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:45.760]  you will be stripped of your degree
[01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:47.560]  or you'll be made to go back a year.
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.560]  You'll be penalized if you thank God.
[01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:53.360]  Now, you can get up there and thank Harry Potter.
[01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:56.120]  As I said earlier, you can thank the Dalai Lama.
[01:01:56.120 --> 01:01:57.600]  Just do not thank Jesus Christ.
[01:01:57.600 --> 01:01:58.600]  Don't talk about God.
[01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:01.160]  And you can pump your fist in the air,
[01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:03.400]  but don't do the Catholic Cross or whatever.
[01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:05.600]  If you make a touchdown or hit a knee
[01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:09.680]  or you'll be suspended or charged thousands of dollars.
[01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:11.720]  Separation in church and state means
[01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:14.120]  that state can't have an official religion
[01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:16.800]  and can't fund religion, which we have
[01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:18.160]  with face-to-face initiatives
[01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:19.960]  that Bush and Obama have been pushing,
[01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:21.600]  totally illegal on its face.
[01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:24.480]  They have turned this into this deal
[01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:25.760]  where they find a Bible.
[01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:27.560]  This has happened a bunch in a Texas school
[01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:29.720]  and Illinois school and they'll throw them away
[01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:31.320]  or suspend you.
[01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:33.760]  It's like you had a Hustler magazine or Playboy.
[01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:38.760]  And now, if a Native American puts a feather in their hair,
[01:02:41.500 --> 01:02:43.660]  which I guess means you're graduating into a man,
[01:02:43.660 --> 01:02:45.380]  I think that just means you're 13 years old,
[01:02:45.380 --> 01:02:48.340]  14 years old, whatever, you're gonna puberty, 12 years old.
[01:02:49.540 --> 01:02:52.500]  But none of the less, women can wear earrings,
[01:02:52.500 --> 01:02:54.980]  people can wear hats, you can wear a tie.
[01:02:54.980 --> 01:02:55.900]  Those are all the dormants,
[01:02:55.900 --> 01:02:59.220]  but don't wear your cultural religious symbol.
[01:02:59.220 --> 01:03:04.220]  Meaning, your spirit's now elevated, soaring like an eagle.
[01:03:05.660 --> 01:03:07.480]  You're now in touch with your ancestors,
[01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:09.100]  you're now a brave.
[01:03:09.100 --> 01:03:11.860]  You do that, you're going to get in trouble.
[01:03:11.860 --> 01:03:14.340]  Native American students sues to wear eagle feather
[01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:18.260]  at graduation, should a graduating high school student,
[01:03:18.260 --> 01:03:21.940]  this is K-I-R-O-7, be allowed to wear an eagle feather,
[01:03:21.940 --> 01:03:24.460]  an item with cultural religious significance to him
[01:03:24.460 --> 01:03:27.300]  as a member of a Native American tribe at his graduation.
[01:03:27.300 --> 01:03:30.780]  His school district has said no, but Christian Titman
[01:03:30.780 --> 01:03:32.700]  followed a lawsuit in Monday asserting his free speech
[01:03:32.700 --> 01:03:33.900]  when religious freedom rights
[01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:34.900]  out of the state constitution
[01:03:34.900 --> 01:03:36.780]  in California's education code.
[01:03:36.780 --> 01:03:37.700]  Absolutely.
[01:03:38.740 --> 01:03:41.460]  You can go and hand out Bible tracks at lunch
[01:03:41.460 --> 01:03:44.900]  or during proper times at school, can't do it in class.
[01:03:44.900 --> 01:03:46.660]  You can share the gospel with someone,
[01:03:46.660 --> 01:03:49.580]  or you can share your love of killing babies
[01:03:49.580 --> 01:03:51.340]  in Satanism through abortion.
[01:03:52.780 --> 01:03:54.300]  You have your religious right,
[01:03:54.300 --> 01:03:56.740]  of course it makes sarcastic on the devil worship front,
[01:03:56.740 --> 01:03:59.340]  but this just shows how they've distorted all this.
[01:04:00.860 --> 01:04:03.780]  Now continuing, family threatened with jail
[01:04:03.780 --> 01:04:05.380]  for cheering, graduating relatives,
[01:04:05.380 --> 01:04:07.940]  that article's on infohorses.com and there's video.
[01:04:09.060 --> 01:04:11.580]  $500 fines for expressing support.
[01:04:13.380 --> 01:04:15.500]  And you know, it's a big deal in this low income,
[01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:18.140]  mainly black area, big deal for anybody
[01:04:18.140 --> 01:04:20.260]  to be getting out of high school.
[01:04:20.260 --> 01:04:23.380]  And folks cheer and get excited.
[01:04:23.380 --> 01:04:26.180]  I remember people cheered at my graduation for folks.
[01:04:26.180 --> 01:04:27.220]  My family really didn't,
[01:04:27.220 --> 01:04:28.780]  because I mean, it was kind of embarrassing,
[01:04:28.780 --> 01:04:32.060]  but the point is, is that it just shows
[01:04:32.060 --> 01:04:34.340]  how they'll throw you in jail or fire you
[01:04:34.340 --> 01:04:37.540]  for feeding a homeless person or cheering
[01:04:37.540 --> 01:04:39.460]  on a graduation or kick you out or whatever,
[01:04:39.460 --> 01:04:40.540]  if you say you love Jesus,
[01:04:40.540 --> 01:04:43.140]  but mega banks can steal the whole country blind,
[01:04:43.140 --> 01:04:45.420]  spy on us without warrants, do whatever they want,
[01:04:45.420 --> 01:04:47.060]  and it's supposedly a-okay.
[01:04:48.460 --> 01:04:51.460]  All right, we'll be back with a major whistleblower
[01:04:51.460 --> 01:04:53.420]  in the fight to restore our republic
[01:04:53.420 --> 01:04:54.940]  and the fourth amendment.
[01:04:54.940 --> 01:04:58.540]  I'm Alex Jones, infohorses.com and prisonplanet.com,
[01:04:58.540 --> 01:05:00.220]  our flagship sites.
[01:05:00.220 --> 01:05:02.380]  Well, it looks like the Justice Department
[01:05:02.380 --> 01:05:06.020]  wants to ban more Americans from owning guns.
[01:05:06.020 --> 01:05:08.820]  That's right, President Barack Hussein Obama
[01:05:08.820 --> 01:05:11.900]  is proposing new firearm regulations
[01:05:11.900 --> 01:05:13.740]  that will revoke gun rights
[01:05:13.740 --> 01:05:17.660]  from those the government declares to be mentally unfit.
[01:05:17.660 --> 01:05:19.980]  And that's a scary thought considering the fact
[01:05:19.980 --> 01:05:22.620]  that the official diagnostic system
[01:05:22.620 --> 01:05:25.980]  for mental disorders in the U.S., the DSM-5,
[01:05:25.980 --> 01:05:29.780]  is so broad that almost every form of human behavior
[01:05:29.780 --> 01:05:33.100]  can be diagnosed as some type of mental illness.
[01:05:33.100 --> 01:05:36.980]  For example, in 2012, the Department of Veteran Affairs
[01:05:36.980 --> 01:05:39.580]  sent out letters to U.S. military veterans
[01:05:39.580 --> 01:05:42.220]  to inform them that their competence levels
[01:05:42.220 --> 01:05:43.700]  were under review.
[01:05:43.700 --> 01:05:46.500]  And if the federal government rated them incompetent,
[01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:48.420]  they would be prohibited from purchasing,
[01:05:48.420 --> 01:05:51.900]  possessing, receiving, or transporting a firearm
[01:05:51.900 --> 01:05:52.980]  or even ammo.

[01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:07.180]  praised the health benefits of silver.

[01:06:59.700 --> 01:07:03.020]  Alex Jones here with InfoWarsLife.com,
[01:07:03.020 --> 01:07:06.340]  Consumer Alert Report, many of you are aware
[01:07:06.340 --> 01:07:09.100]  that around the world, most populations
[01:07:09.100 --> 01:07:12.220]  are woefully deficient in clean forms of iodine.
[01:07:12.220 --> 01:07:15.780]  The good news is, our listeners over the past two years
[01:07:15.780 --> 01:07:20.300]  tried X2 nascent iodine and experienced it for themselves.
[01:07:20.300 --> 01:07:23.500]  The bad news is, for the first time in more than a year,
[01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:26.900]  supplies at infowarslife.com of survival shield
[01:07:26.900 --> 01:07:29.340]  X2 nascent iodine are running low.
[01:07:29.340 --> 01:07:32.220]  But what's even more serious is the supply
[01:07:32.220 --> 01:07:34.100]  of these deep earth crystals.
[01:07:34.100 --> 01:07:38.860]  That exclusive 999 pure source is proprietary
[01:07:38.860 --> 01:07:41.460]  and only available to infowarslife.com
[01:07:41.460 --> 01:07:44.620]  and that supply is running low and is in question.
[01:07:44.620 --> 01:07:46.140]  That's why it's more important than ever
[01:07:46.140 --> 01:07:48.740]  to secure your current and long time supply
[01:07:48.740 --> 01:07:51.540]  of survival shield nascent iodine X2 today.
[01:07:51.540 --> 01:07:54.540]  Available exclusively at infowarslife.com

[01:08:01.660 --> 01:08:03.820]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network
[01:08:03.820 --> 01:08:07.060]  proudly presents the Alex Jones show
[01:08:07.060 --> 01:08:09.740]  because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:09.740 --> 01:08:29.740]  MUSIC
[01:08:29.740 --> 01:08:33.260]  Just passed by Congress, the USA Freedom Act.
[01:08:33.260 --> 01:08:36.220]  Well, not real freedom, but the kind of freedom
[01:08:36.220 --> 01:08:39.060]  we act like we have in the USA.
[01:08:39.060 --> 01:08:41.780]  Think of it as SISPA for phone companies,
[01:08:41.780 --> 01:08:44.100]  a kind of cozy symbiotic relationship
[01:08:44.100 --> 01:08:45.740]  between the corporate oligarchy
[01:08:45.740 --> 01:08:47.460]  and the authoritarian government.
[01:08:47.460 --> 01:08:49.340]  MUSIC
[01:08:49.340 --> 01:08:51.380]  The phone companies will now store your info
[01:08:51.380 --> 01:08:54.380]  and pass it on to the paranoid government on demand.
[01:08:54.380 --> 01:08:57.540]  And the phone companies will be granted freedom from liability.
[01:08:57.540 --> 01:09:01.540]  Now that's real freedom, the kind only the big guys get.
[01:09:01.540 --> 01:09:02.460]  Yeah.
[01:09:02.460 --> 01:09:03.860]  But wait, there's more.
[01:09:03.860 --> 01:09:06.260]  Now Congress will be notified whenever the secret
[01:09:06.260 --> 01:09:09.940]  buys a court, well, it's not really a court, just a single judge,
[01:09:09.940 --> 01:09:11.300]  reinterprets the law.
[01:09:11.300 --> 01:09:13.140]  CHEERING
[01:09:13.140 --> 01:09:16.060]  That's great, because they've been changing the law
[01:09:16.060 --> 01:09:17.740]  and not even telling us.
[01:09:17.740 --> 01:09:19.740]  Now they're going to let us know.
[01:09:19.740 --> 01:09:21.700]  Isn't America great?
[01:09:21.700 --> 01:09:24.180]  The USA Freedom Act.
[01:09:24.180 --> 01:09:24.780]  Offer void.
[01:09:24.780 --> 01:09:26.740]  We're prohibited by law.
[01:09:26.740 --> 01:09:28.780]  Renfowars.com, I'm David Knight.
[01:09:31.900 --> 01:09:35.220]  Ladies and gentlemen, Kirk Wiebe joins us
[01:09:35.220 --> 01:09:37.340]  after spending four years and included
[01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:38.900]  tours of duty in Turkey and Japan
[01:09:38.900 --> 01:09:41.140]  with the Intelligence Army and the United States Air Force
[01:09:41.140 --> 01:09:45.340]  during 63 to 67, Kirk attended Indiana University
[01:09:45.340 --> 01:09:48.100]  receiving master's degrees in Russian language.
[01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:50.300]  In 74, the year I was born, Kirk then
[01:09:50.300 --> 01:09:53.500]  headed east to work for the National Security Agency,
[01:09:53.500 --> 01:09:55.860]  retiring in October 2001.
[01:09:55.860 --> 01:10:00.140]  Same time that Benny and Drake and others left.
[01:10:00.140 --> 01:10:01.500]  And then, of course, got SWAT teamed
[01:10:01.500 --> 01:10:02.820]  and they tried to set them up.
[01:10:02.820 --> 01:10:08.220]  That's back in the news today dealing with the NSA.
[01:10:08.220 --> 01:10:12.380]  Judge Probe's destruction of evidence in NSA leak prosecution
[01:10:12.380 --> 01:10:14.780]  and that was of Thomas Drake.
[01:10:14.780 --> 01:10:19.860]  So they've come after these heroes who just told the truth.
[01:10:19.860 --> 01:10:22.380]  He was awarded the Meritorious Civilian Service Award,
[01:10:22.380 --> 01:10:24.700]  the NSA's second highest honor for important work
[01:10:24.700 --> 01:10:26.940]  done on foreign strategic weapons systems.
[01:10:26.940 --> 01:10:29.500]  2002, when it was clear that the NSA was headed down
[01:10:29.500 --> 01:10:32.300]  the wrong path, Kirk, along with fellow NSA retirees, Bill
[01:10:32.300 --> 01:10:34.860]  Benny, Ed Loomis, and former senior staff
[01:10:34.860 --> 01:10:38.100]  for the White House Select Subcommittee on Intelligence,
[01:10:38.100 --> 01:10:41.540]  Diana Rohr initiated a Department of Defense
[01:10:41.540 --> 01:10:44.300]  Inspector General complaint about mismanagement
[01:10:44.300 --> 01:10:46.180]  and the waste of hundreds of millions of dollars
[01:10:46.180 --> 01:10:47.780]  the National Security Agency.
[01:10:47.780 --> 01:10:49.380]  And I won't go over all the rest of it,
[01:10:49.380 --> 01:10:55.980]  but they were persecuted for going through the system
[01:10:55.980 --> 01:10:57.540]  trying to reform it.
[01:10:57.540 --> 01:11:03.540]  And now we've had the USA Freedom Act,
[01:11:03.540 --> 01:11:06.580]  now we have the USA Freedom Act signed,
[01:11:06.580 --> 01:11:07.900]  and they're claiming it's a reform.
[01:11:07.900 --> 01:11:09.940]  From what I've seen, what you just heard David Knight
[01:11:09.940 --> 01:11:14.100]  break down, it's actually just a shell game.
[01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:17.300]  Kirk Webe, thank you so much for joining us today.
[01:11:17.300 --> 01:11:21.700]  Alex Jones, it's a distinct honor to be with you.
[01:11:21.700 --> 01:11:23.260]  Well, it's great to have you, sir.
[01:11:23.260 --> 01:11:24.540]  I could ask a lot of questions here,
[01:11:24.540 --> 01:11:26.260]  but why don't you start at the beginning
[01:11:26.260 --> 01:11:28.100]  and just recap what you've witnessed
[01:11:28.100 --> 01:11:30.420]  being inside the NSA, what's happened since,
[01:11:30.420 --> 01:11:35.340]  and I'd like to get your take on the USA Freedom Act.
[01:11:35.340 --> 01:11:40.460]  What's happened in a nutshell, Alex, is the very thing,
[01:11:40.460 --> 01:11:45.300]  the very thing that Eisenhower, President Eisenhower,
[01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:49.900]  on the night of January 17th, 1961,
[01:11:49.900 --> 01:11:55.580]  warned all of us about, and that is the, excuse me,
[01:11:55.580 --> 01:12:01.780]  undue influence of the military industrial complex
[01:12:01.780 --> 01:12:03.860]  on the ability of this government
[01:12:03.860 --> 01:12:07.900]  to function the way the founders intended it to,
[01:12:07.900 --> 01:12:11.420]  unencumbered by outside influences,
[01:12:11.420 --> 01:12:13.860]  other than those expressly set up
[01:12:13.860 --> 01:12:15.980]  to deliver the voice of the people.
[01:12:15.980 --> 01:12:19.540]  So we have people willing to sacrifice the security
[01:12:19.540 --> 01:12:21.460]  of the nation for money.
[01:12:21.460 --> 01:12:24.740]  It's really corruption that is the real elephant
[01:12:24.740 --> 01:12:29.340]  in the room in the background here behind all of this.
[01:12:29.340 --> 01:12:32.980]  So you're saying the running of this tens of millions
[01:12:32.980 --> 01:12:38.340]  of dollars a year grid is its own evil of itself
[01:12:38.340 --> 01:12:41.060]  separate from the undue power and influence.
[01:12:41.060 --> 01:12:44.220]  This gives the special interest, corporate and governmental,
[01:12:44.220 --> 01:12:46.580]  that are able to have access to the information.
[01:12:46.580 --> 01:12:48.900]  That ends the level playing field.
[01:12:48.900 --> 01:12:50.260]  Absolutely.
[01:12:50.260 --> 01:12:51.700]  It's gone.
[01:12:51.700 --> 01:12:54.500]  If Eisenhower saw what's in place today,
[01:12:54.500 --> 01:12:58.220]  what has really become the military industrial
[01:12:58.220 --> 01:13:03.220]  intelligence complex, we need to add another I
[01:13:03.220 --> 01:13:06.940]  because of what's gone on in the intervening 50 years
[01:13:06.940 --> 01:13:10.460]  since Eisenhower was in office.
[01:13:10.460 --> 01:13:12.580]  That thing is huge.
[01:13:12.580 --> 01:13:17.940]  It has multiple tentacles into various states
[01:13:17.940 --> 01:13:20.380]  who elect senators and commissioners
[01:13:20.380 --> 01:13:24.300]  who learn benefit from businesses in their states,
[01:13:24.300 --> 01:13:28.700]  who are milking the government trough of money.
[01:13:28.700 --> 01:13:33.180]  For billions of dollars, many of them getting rich
[01:13:33.180 --> 01:13:38.500]  at our expense, all of this causing a constitutional crisis
[01:13:38.500 --> 01:13:42.580]  because we have a Congress more unwilling to defend
[01:13:42.580 --> 01:13:48.580]  the Constitution than ever in the history of the country.
[01:13:48.580 --> 01:13:51.740]  Did you see the clip yesterday speaking on the Senate floor
[01:13:51.740 --> 01:13:54.100]  with the leader of the Senate, Mitch McConnell,
[01:13:54.100 --> 01:13:56.820]  got up and just said, there is no illegal spying.
[01:13:56.820 --> 01:14:00.220]  We've seen Senator Rubio say the exact same thing
[01:14:00.220 --> 01:14:03.140]  just with a straight face.
[01:14:03.140 --> 01:14:06.180]  It's the equivalent of telling us that Santa Claus is real.
[01:14:06.180 --> 01:14:07.980]  It's so over the top.
[01:14:07.980 --> 01:14:10.700]  Yeah, it is.
[01:14:10.700 --> 01:14:13.220]  Here we have two senators, one of who
[01:14:13.220 --> 01:14:19.420]  wants to become president, willing to stand there and lie
[01:14:19.420 --> 01:14:25.420]  and not wince about it, not have any shame, none.
[01:14:25.420 --> 01:14:26.820]  And this is what we're under.
[01:14:26.820 --> 01:14:29.580]  Either that, Alex, or the two of them
[01:14:29.580 --> 01:14:33.820]  are so ignorant of what NSA is really up to.
[01:14:33.820 --> 01:14:36.820]  And I really do believe NSA's made
[01:14:36.820 --> 01:14:40.540]  it difficult for many people in Congress
[01:14:40.540 --> 01:14:43.100]  to understand what it's really doing.
[01:14:43.100 --> 01:14:46.700]  But as long as Congress isn't willing to do what I call
[01:14:46.700 --> 01:14:52.740]  earnest and real oversight, this is what we're going to get.
[01:14:52.740 --> 01:14:55.580]  We have a major NSA whistleblower joining us right now,
[01:14:55.580 --> 01:14:58.380]  accuracy.org, exposedfacts.org.
[01:14:58.380 --> 01:15:00.500]  But I want to play the Mitch McConnell clip
[01:15:00.500 --> 01:15:03.420]  that we aired last hour in case new listeners just tuned in.
[01:15:03.420 --> 01:15:05.020]  This is the new party line.
[01:15:05.020 --> 01:15:06.820]  They're kind of going back to the old line
[01:15:06.820 --> 01:15:09.060]  that Bush had that there is no illegal spying going on,
[01:15:09.060 --> 01:15:12.380]  even though whistleblowers and AT&T and others were going public
[01:15:12.380 --> 01:15:14.300]  and they knew full well what was happening.
[01:15:14.300 --> 01:15:18.740]  And now it's a bipartisan push by Obama and Republican leaders
[01:15:18.740 --> 01:15:20.860]  to just say, are you insane?
[01:15:20.860 --> 01:15:23.100]  There's no such thing as warrantless spying.
[01:15:23.100 --> 01:15:24.340]  It's not going on.
[01:15:24.340 --> 01:15:26.500]  Here's the leader of the Senate.
[01:15:26.500 --> 01:15:29.340]  It speaks to the right of the people
[01:15:29.340 --> 01:15:36.780]  to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects.
[01:15:36.780 --> 01:15:38.660]  But these records belong to the phone companies.
[01:15:38.660 --> 01:15:44.820]  And let me remind the Senate, the standard
[01:15:44.820 --> 01:15:47.740]  for reasonable, articulable suspicion
[01:15:47.740 --> 01:15:51.260]  is that the terror suspect is associated
[01:15:51.260 --> 01:15:54.100]  with a, quote, foreign terrorist organization,
[01:15:54.100 --> 01:15:57.700]  end quote, as determined by court.
[01:16:02.380 --> 01:16:04.580]  Nobody's civil liberties are being violated here.
[01:16:04.580 --> 01:16:12.860]  Kirk Wiebe, NSA whistleblower, what is your view on his statement?
[01:16:12.860 --> 01:16:16.500]  It's specious.
[01:16:16.500 --> 01:16:18.220]  I don't know what else to call it.
[01:16:18.220 --> 01:16:23.540]  You know, while he is technically correct,
[01:16:23.540 --> 01:16:28.020]  he's alluding to a legal precedent
[01:16:28.020 --> 01:16:33.660]  that if most people understood it or even heard about it,
[01:16:33.660 --> 01:16:35.540]  they would shake their head and say,
[01:16:35.540 --> 01:16:39.860]  what has happened to the profession of law
[01:16:39.860 --> 01:16:42.580]  and interpretation of the law?
[01:16:42.580 --> 01:16:47.860]  The authority that Mitch McConnell is inferring here,
[01:16:47.860 --> 01:16:54.140]  when he says we have no right to privacy of our phone records,
[01:16:54.140 --> 01:17:01.660]  is a case called Smith versus Maryland from the year 1979,
[01:17:01.660 --> 01:17:05.140]  when none of us even knew how to spell smartphone,
[01:17:05.140 --> 01:17:09.380]  let alone know what it means.
[01:17:09.380 --> 01:17:13.540]  It's from a time when the court said, yes,
[01:17:13.540 --> 01:17:18.340]  the police were not doing anything wrong when they tapped
[01:17:18.340 --> 01:17:24.020]  a dialed number between a criminal and his victim
[01:17:24.020 --> 01:17:28.740]  and used that evidence to prove the connection between the criminal
[01:17:28.740 --> 01:17:35.020]  and the victim, who he had been harassing via telephone.
[01:17:35.020 --> 01:17:36.220]  So they had probable cause.
[01:17:36.220 --> 01:17:37.020]  They had probable cause.
[01:17:37.020 --> 01:17:38.380]  It was a suspect.
[01:17:38.380 --> 01:17:40.300]  Exactly.
[01:17:40.300 --> 01:17:42.860]  Now, that went to the Supreme Court
[01:17:42.860 --> 01:17:45.620]  because the criminal said, you can't use that information.
[01:17:45.620 --> 01:17:48.420]  The court said, oh, yes, we can.
[01:17:48.420 --> 01:17:50.020]  Yes, the government can.
[01:17:50.020 --> 01:17:52.060]  Yes, the police can.
[01:17:52.060 --> 01:17:55.820]  You don't have any expectation of that not being used.
[01:17:55.820 --> 01:17:56.620]  But you're right.
[01:17:56.620 --> 01:17:59.860]  The context was probable cause.
[01:17:59.860 --> 01:18:02.980]  That's a lot different than demanding the phone company
[01:18:02.980 --> 01:18:06.340]  hand over all their records about every American,
[01:18:06.340 --> 01:18:09.820]  including every innocent American, which, of course,
[01:18:09.820 --> 01:18:12.300]  is the majority of those records.
[01:18:12.300 --> 01:18:14.300]  Well, you bring up Eisenhower.
[01:18:14.300 --> 01:18:16.700]  I want to play a clip of his famous speech here in a moment.
[01:18:16.700 --> 01:18:19.500]  He talked about a technological elite controlling
[01:18:19.500 --> 01:18:21.380]  the military industrial complex being the threat.
[01:18:21.380 --> 01:18:23.020]  That's the full quote.
[01:18:23.020 --> 01:18:26.820]  But it's so clear they've already gone this far,
[01:18:26.820 --> 01:18:29.460]  and they're debating Patriot Act metadata.
[01:18:29.460 --> 01:18:30.980]  And when we know they're recording
[01:18:30.980 --> 01:18:34.300]  80% of the actual audio, and corporations
[01:18:34.300 --> 01:18:37.500]  are in a race to do it as well, it just doesn't stand.
[01:18:37.500 --> 01:18:42.580]  I mean, even USA Today is admitting the DEA spies
[01:18:42.580 --> 01:18:45.100]  on everything without warrants, and then
[01:18:45.100 --> 01:18:47.340]  goes and creates fake court cases.
[01:18:47.340 --> 01:18:52.620]  So I'm wondering what comes next in this slide into tyranny.
[01:18:52.620 --> 01:18:56.780]  But here's President Eisenhower warning us,
[01:18:56.780 --> 01:18:58.940]  and I guess today they demonize him
[01:18:58.940 --> 01:19:01.940]  like they're demonizing Rand Paul.
[01:19:01.940 --> 01:19:06.180]  We must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger
[01:19:06.180 --> 01:19:09.420]  that public policy could itself become
[01:19:09.420 --> 01:19:14.740]  the captive of a scientific, technological elite.
[01:19:14.740 --> 01:19:16.660]  And the councils of government, we
[01:19:16.660 --> 01:19:21.340]  must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence,
[01:19:21.340 --> 01:19:25.020]  whether sought or unsought, by the military industrial
[01:19:25.020 --> 01:19:26.460]  complex.
[01:19:26.460 --> 01:19:28.700]  But then we have Governor Rick Perry
[01:19:28.700 --> 01:19:32.620]  outgoing saying, you cannot question the military
[01:19:32.620 --> 01:19:35.580]  in a speech last week, but the military's
[01:19:35.580 --> 01:19:36.500]  run by the politicians.
[01:19:36.500 --> 01:19:39.380]  It's just an insane statement.
[01:19:39.380 --> 01:19:40.060]  Kirk, stay there.
[01:19:40.060 --> 01:19:41.460]  We're going to come right back to you.
[01:19:41.460 --> 01:19:43.660]  Exposedfacts.org.
[01:19:43.660 --> 01:19:47.020]  Kirk Wiebe is an American Patriot, high-level NSA,
[01:19:47.020 --> 01:19:47.700]  whistleblower.
[01:19:47.700 --> 01:19:49.060]  They were all persecuted.
[01:19:49.060 --> 01:19:51.740]  We're going to talk some about that when we come back.
[01:19:51.740 --> 01:19:53.540]  They went through channels, so they
[01:19:53.540 --> 01:19:56.340]  got harassed, indicted, SWAT-teamed,
[01:19:56.340 --> 01:19:58.140]  fake court cases made up.
[01:19:58.140 --> 01:19:58.980]  Just incredible.
[01:19:58.980 --> 01:20:00.300]  Stay with us.
[01:20:00.300 --> 01:20:02.260]  So I say to Mark at lunch, look,
[01:20:02.260 --> 01:20:03.580]  I keep hearing from the government
[01:20:03.580 --> 01:20:06.460]  that they're worried someday ISIS may get here.
[01:20:06.460 --> 01:20:10.380]  Had I go duck, Garland, Texas, Mohammed cartoon shooting,
[01:20:10.380 --> 01:20:12.220]  ISIS is already here.
[01:20:12.220 --> 01:20:14.540]  I'm not waiting for these people to defend me.
[01:20:14.540 --> 01:20:17.420]  If they don't know ISIS as you already, they got no clue.
[01:20:17.420 --> 01:20:18.820]  I'm taking care of myself.
[01:20:18.820 --> 01:20:23.780]  Guns80.com, AR-15 kits, 30-shot magazines, great prices.

[01:21:59.300 --> 01:22:01.500]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough,
[01:22:01.500 --> 01:22:03.500]  now they're adding ammonia?
[01:22:03.500 --> 01:22:04.140]  It's true.
[01:22:04.140 --> 01:22:06.980]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine
[01:22:06.980 --> 01:22:08.300]  to your water supply.
[01:22:08.300 --> 01:22:10.700]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.

[01:22:12.940 --> 01:22:15.460]  you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[01:22:15.460 --> 01:22:20.140]  New NSF EPA certified lab tests show EPA Berkey water filters
[01:22:20.140 --> 01:22:23.180]  remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals, BPA,
[01:22:23.180 --> 01:22:25.780]  pesticides, bacteria and viruses,
[01:22:25.780 --> 01:22:28.380]  all forms of fluoride, and much more.
[01:22:28.380 --> 01:22:30.820]  Big Berkey water filters are the original and most

[01:22:58.980 --> 01:23:01.100]  Are you suffering from EP?
[01:23:01.100 --> 01:23:03.020]  The symptoms include fraudulent charges
[01:23:03.020 --> 01:23:03.980]  to your credit card.
[01:23:03.980 --> 01:23:06.540]  Your subway card says it's empty, but you bought it yesterday.
[01:23:06.540 --> 01:23:08.220]  Someone's been in your hotel room,
[01:23:08.220 --> 01:23:11.340]  but the desk clerk says they only show you entering the room.
[01:23:11.340 --> 01:23:13.100]  These are signs of EP.
[01:23:13.100 --> 01:23:16.500]  Electronic pickpocketing, payment cards, transit cards,
[01:23:16.500 --> 01:23:17.860]  even hotel room keys.
[01:23:17.860 --> 01:23:20.180]  Use a radio chip so you can just wave your card
[01:23:20.180 --> 01:23:23.220]  at the register, the turnstile, or your hotel room door.
[01:23:23.220 --> 01:23:26.300]  But what's convenient for you is also convenient for feeds,
[01:23:26.300 --> 01:23:29.100]  waving scanners to electronically pickpocket you
[01:23:29.100 --> 01:23:30.500]  without even touching you.
[01:23:30.500 --> 01:23:32.540]  The good news is there's a cure.
[01:23:32.540 --> 01:23:35.980]  ID Stronghold has created leather wallets and clutches
[01:23:35.980 --> 01:23:38.060]  that have built-in EP protection.
[01:23:38.060 --> 01:23:40.500]  Layers of shielding material, cleverly concealed
[01:23:40.500 --> 01:23:43.980]  in a beautiful leather wallet that stops the symptoms of EP.
[01:23:43.980 --> 01:23:47.180]  Go to idstronghold.com now and get the cure,
[01:23:47.180 --> 01:23:48.820]  idstronghold.com.
[01:23:48.820 --> 01:23:50.220]  Warning, ID Stronghold wallets could
[01:23:50.220 --> 01:23:52.060]  lead to feelings of safety and security, comfort
[01:23:52.060 --> 01:23:53.260]  and crowds, and euphoria.
[01:23:53.260 --> 01:23:54.580]  If you experience these emotions,
[01:23:54.580 --> 01:23:56.020]  immediately inform your friends and family
[01:23:56.020 --> 01:23:58.220]  about idstronghold.com so they can feel better too.
[01:24:05.540 --> 01:24:08.180]  Is James Clapper famously being questioned
[01:24:08.180 --> 01:24:12.420]  by Wyden in Congress and lying and saying, spying?
[01:24:12.420 --> 01:24:13.700]  We don't spy on anything.
[01:24:13.700 --> 01:24:16.260]  In fact, what's spying at the NSA?
[01:24:16.260 --> 01:24:19.580]  It's like saying, the sun and the sky never heard of that.
[01:24:19.580 --> 01:24:21.660]  Here's the famous clip.
[01:24:21.660 --> 01:24:24.460]  The NSA director was at a conference,
[01:24:24.460 --> 01:24:27.500]  and he was asked a question about the NSA surveillance
[01:24:27.500 --> 01:24:28.620]  of Americans.
[01:24:28.620 --> 01:24:31.340]  He replied, and I quote here, the story
[01:24:31.340 --> 01:24:35.340]  that we have millions or hundreds of millions of dossiers
[01:24:35.340 --> 01:24:38.220]  on people is completely false.
[01:24:38.220 --> 01:24:39.740]  The reason I'm asking the question
[01:24:39.740 --> 01:24:43.580]  is, having served on the committee now for a dozen years,
[01:24:43.580 --> 01:24:48.420]  I don't really know what a dossier is in this context.
[01:24:48.420 --> 01:24:52.380]  So what I wanted to see is if you can give a yes or no answer
[01:24:52.380 --> 01:24:58.220]  to the question, does the NSA collect any type of data at all
[01:24:58.220 --> 01:25:02.620]  on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans?
[01:25:02.620 --> 01:25:04.540]  No, sir.
[01:25:04.540 --> 01:25:06.980]  It does not.
[01:25:06.980 --> 01:25:09.260]  Not wittingly.
[01:25:09.260 --> 01:25:13.700]  There are cases where they could inadvertently, perhaps,
[01:25:13.700 --> 01:25:16.740]  collect, but not wittingly.
[01:25:16.740 --> 01:25:18.620]  That's lying to Congress under oath right there,
[01:25:18.620 --> 01:25:20.820]  and now his lawyer two weeks ago said
[01:25:20.820 --> 01:25:23.460]  he just basically had some brain flatulence
[01:25:23.460 --> 01:25:26.660]  and had forgotten, as the head of the NSA,
[01:25:26.660 --> 01:25:29.140]  that they had any data on Americans.
[01:25:29.140 --> 01:25:33.060]  I mean, that's got to be one of the biggest lies in history.
[01:25:33.060 --> 01:25:36.820]  I mean, Pinocchio has nothing on this guy.
[01:25:36.820 --> 01:25:40.220]  I don't think Pinocchio should be the symbol of lying anymore.
[01:25:40.220 --> 01:25:44.380]  Kirk, I mean, shouldn't it be Clapper?
[01:25:44.380 --> 01:25:48.460]  You know, Alex, almost nobody knows this.
[01:25:48.460 --> 01:25:53.620]  But when I was in the process of earning the Meritorious Civilian
[01:25:53.620 --> 01:25:59.820]  Service Award for work against foreign strategic weapons,
[01:25:59.820 --> 01:26:06.380]  Jim Clapper was one of my primary customers for intelligence,
[01:26:06.380 --> 01:26:09.980]  because at that point he was stationed with the US Strategic
[01:26:09.980 --> 01:26:14.580]  Air Command out in Omaha, Nebraska.
[01:26:14.580 --> 01:26:17.660]  And I had the utmost regard for him.
[01:26:17.660 --> 01:26:20.660]  So I know he personally have sat in rooms with him,
[01:26:20.660 --> 01:26:22.140]  talked to him.
[01:26:22.140 --> 01:26:26.660]  And for him, for me to watch what you just showed
[01:26:26.660 --> 01:26:28.220]  is a complete 180.
[01:26:28.220 --> 01:26:30.420]  I mean, he went to the dark side.
[01:26:30.420 --> 01:26:35.260]  But I know what happens when you get into government this deep
[01:26:35.260 --> 01:26:37.260]  and you're representing the Pentagon
[01:26:37.260 --> 01:26:41.580]  and you're representing NSA and to a degree the FBI
[01:26:41.580 --> 01:26:45.380]  and all these agencies that are now dipping in
[01:26:45.380 --> 01:26:49.620]  to the intelligence game for their own particular agendas
[01:26:49.620 --> 01:26:56.060]  and reasons, you are very reluctant to put something
[01:26:56.060 --> 01:26:58.300]  in unpleasant in their punch bowls.
[01:26:58.300 --> 01:27:02.060]  You want to support the good old boy network.
[01:27:02.060 --> 01:27:03.780]  You feel like they're your children.
[01:27:03.780 --> 01:27:04.940]  You're their boss.
[01:27:04.940 --> 01:27:07.060]  You're protecting them.
[01:27:07.060 --> 01:27:08.220]  Exactly.
[01:27:08.220 --> 01:27:13.180]  In other words, those who have taken oaths to uphold
[01:27:13.180 --> 01:27:16.460]  and defend the Constitution from all enemies, foreign
[01:27:16.460 --> 01:27:20.020]  and domestic, are not doing it.
[01:27:20.020 --> 01:27:25.620]  They're more pro misuse of this apparatus.
[01:27:25.620 --> 01:27:28.380]  So back when Clapper was actually one of the head guys
[01:27:28.380 --> 01:27:32.300]  at SAC defending us from Russian attacks, doing real work,
[01:27:32.300 --> 01:27:34.940]  spying on weapons systems, defending the Republic,
[01:27:34.940 --> 01:27:35.780]  he was a good guy.
[01:27:35.780 --> 01:27:38.660]  It kind of shows the mission makes the man, the uniform,
[01:27:38.660 --> 01:27:40.700]  the job, who you associate with.
[01:27:40.700 --> 01:27:42.220]  But then he falls into bad company,
[01:27:42.220 --> 01:27:46.860]  becomes a governmental head and kneels to Emperor Palpatine
[01:27:46.860 --> 01:27:48.700]  and joins the Sith.
[01:27:48.700 --> 01:27:50.180]  Exactly.
[01:27:50.180 --> 01:27:52.180]  And that happens to so many people.
[01:27:52.180 --> 01:27:54.500]  And you hear this rationale.
[01:27:54.500 --> 01:27:57.900]  If you talk to people who are part of the complex
[01:27:57.900 --> 01:27:59.700]  that Eisenhower talked about, they'll say, well,
[01:27:59.700 --> 01:28:02.260]  a man's got to eat.
[01:28:02.260 --> 01:28:05.100]  Well, I guess you can prostitute yourself
[01:28:05.100 --> 01:28:07.300]  if that's what you want to do.
[01:28:07.300 --> 01:28:10.380]  We used to stand behind principles in this country.
[01:28:10.380 --> 01:28:14.420]  And I would argue that the way society has developed
[01:28:14.420 --> 01:28:17.980]  over the last 50 years, we're no longer teaching
[01:28:17.980 --> 01:28:19.220]  those principles.
[01:28:19.220 --> 01:28:22.460]  We're no longer stressing the importance.
[01:28:22.460 --> 01:28:26.060]  We're poo-pooing the idea of the Pledge of Allegiance.
[01:28:26.060 --> 01:28:29.260]  We're poo-pooing the teaching of the Constitution.
[01:28:29.260 --> 01:28:32.220]  So now we have a Constitution, a Bill of Rights,
[01:28:32.220 --> 01:28:35.060]  if you will, the First Amendment, the Second Amendment,
[01:28:35.060 --> 01:28:36.940]  the Fourth, the Fifth, the Sixth.
[01:28:36.940 --> 01:28:41.540]  They're all under attack in one form or another.
[01:28:41.540 --> 01:28:43.900]  I'll tell you, unless we turn this around,
[01:28:43.900 --> 01:28:46.180]  we're going to lose that document.
[01:28:46.180 --> 01:28:49.340]  And then it's anybody's game who's in power.
[01:28:49.340 --> 01:28:51.260]  Don't they call that the bottom falling out?
[01:28:51.260 --> 01:28:53.020]  Because folks think it's cute to have corruption.
[01:28:53.020 --> 01:28:53.780]  Oh, it's going to be OK.
[01:28:53.780 --> 01:28:54.940]  But it always grows.
[01:28:54.940 --> 01:28:56.900]  You're either shrinking it or it's growing.
[01:28:56.900 --> 01:28:59.740]  It doesn't stay at one level.
[01:28:59.740 --> 01:29:02.460]  It's gas-like.
[01:29:02.460 --> 01:29:03.460]  It's moving.
[01:29:03.460 --> 01:29:04.700]  It's kinetic.
[01:29:04.700 --> 01:29:07.980]  And we're moving towards the bottom dropping out.
[01:29:07.980 --> 01:29:09.420]  And then the sky's the limit.
[01:29:09.420 --> 01:29:11.620]  Then we become anarchy.
[01:29:11.620 --> 01:29:13.580]  Absolutely.
[01:29:13.580 --> 01:29:20.220]  And for those who think NSA deserves to be trusted,
[01:29:20.220 --> 01:29:27.660]  let me remind them, the NSA has existed about 68 years.
[01:29:27.660 --> 01:29:33.300]  For 42 of those 68, they've operated illegally,
[01:29:33.300 --> 01:29:38.500]  35 of it between the period 1947 and 1975.
[01:29:38.500 --> 01:29:39.140]  Kirk, wait a minute.
[01:29:39.140 --> 01:29:39.900]  This is too important.
[01:29:39.900 --> 01:29:40.540]  We're going to break.
[01:29:40.540 --> 01:29:41.380]  Long segment coming up.
[01:29:41.380 --> 01:29:43.420]  I'm going to give you the floor to break down this history.
[01:29:43.420 --> 01:29:44.340]  You're going to have the floor.
[01:29:44.340 --> 01:29:46.500]  And we come back to really break it down.
[01:29:46.500 --> 01:29:47.820]  We'll be back in three minutes.
[01:29:47.820 --> 01:29:49.220]  This is important radio, folks.
[01:29:49.220 --> 01:29:50.620]  We're on the march.
[01:29:50.620 --> 01:29:53.060]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.060 --> 01:29:55.900]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.780 --> 01:30:03.220]  Fresh off their victories against manspreading,
[01:30:03.220 --> 01:30:05.100]  for which multiple people have already
[01:30:05.100 --> 01:30:07.260]  been arrested in places like New York,
[01:30:07.260 --> 01:30:09.180]  feminists are now setting their sights
[01:30:09.180 --> 01:30:13.180]  on the highest target possible, Almighty God.
[01:30:13.180 --> 01:30:15.780]  The article, Feminist clergy wants Christians
[01:30:15.780 --> 01:30:17.940]  to refer to God as she breaks down
[01:30:17.940 --> 01:30:21.100]  how an activist group over in England, women in the church
[01:30:21.100 --> 01:30:24.740]  or watch, has already had success putting female bishops
[01:30:24.740 --> 01:30:26.060]  in the church.
[01:30:26.060 --> 01:30:27.740]  But they didn't stop there.
[01:30:27.740 --> 01:30:30.540]  The chairperson for watch was quoted as saying,
[01:30:30.540 --> 01:30:33.780]  the reality is that in many churches up and down the country,
[01:30:33.780 --> 01:30:36.900]  something more than almost default male language about God
[01:30:36.900 --> 01:30:38.420]  is already being used.
[01:30:38.420 --> 01:30:41.300]  She told the Telegraph, quietly, clergy
[01:30:41.300 --> 01:30:45.660]  are just talking about God as she, every now and then.
[01:30:45.660 --> 01:30:48.620]  Keeping in mind that multiple times throughout the Bible,
[01:30:48.620 --> 01:30:52.900]  Jesus refers to God as his father, not his mother,
[01:30:52.900 --> 01:30:54.260]  his father.
[01:30:54.260 --> 01:31:00.340]  You can find this and many other reports on infowars.com.
[01:31:00.340 --> 01:31:01.660]  Another major health threat.
[01:31:01.660 --> 01:31:04.820]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city
[01:31:04.820 --> 01:31:06.620]  has been told not to drink the water.
[01:31:06.620 --> 01:31:09.300]  Ohio governor declaring a state of emergency.
[01:31:09.300 --> 01:31:11.220]  Did you know that the average person
[01:31:11.220 --> 01:31:14.780]  uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home
[01:31:14.780 --> 01:31:16.260]  every single day?
[01:31:16.260 --> 01:31:19.340]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[01:31:19.340 --> 01:31:22.380]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[01:31:22.380 --> 01:31:24.260]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[01:31:24.260 --> 01:31:27.220]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[01:31:27.220 --> 01:31:29.900]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis,
[01:31:29.900 --> 01:31:32.900]  you must have access to safe, clean water.
[01:31:32.900 --> 01:31:36.020]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery
[01:31:36.020 --> 01:31:36.500]  store.
[01:31:36.500 --> 01:31:39.540]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[01:31:39.540 --> 01:31:42.940]  The Pro Pure Pro 1 G2.0 water filtration system
[01:31:42.940 --> 01:31:46.100]  is a must have for every modern, independently minded
[01:31:46.100 --> 01:31:46.820]  household.

[01:32:00.180 --> 01:32:02.140]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard
[01:32:02.140 --> 01:32:05.180]  firearms manufacturers and sponsors on my syndicated radio
[01:32:05.180 --> 01:32:08.460]  show or the nightly news or the news website infowars.com.
[01:32:08.460 --> 01:32:10.940]  Because the companies I've been approached by
[01:32:10.940 --> 01:32:13.100]  were not the highest quality.
[01:32:13.100 --> 01:32:15.380]  And they weren't as affordable as they should be.
[01:32:15.380 --> 01:32:16.860]  So I refused.
[01:32:16.860 --> 01:32:19.900]  Probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over the years.
[01:32:19.900 --> 01:32:21.900]  Well then, about six months ago, we
[01:32:21.900 --> 01:32:26.180]  get contacted by a head down firearms, hdfirearms.com.
[01:32:26.180 --> 01:32:28.420]  Own and run by a bunch of former Navy SEALs,
[01:32:28.420 --> 01:32:31.220]  special ops people, their veterans, their patriots,
[01:32:31.220 --> 01:32:32.860]  their listeners of the radio show,
[01:32:32.860 --> 01:32:34.700]  and they want to support the broadcast.
[01:32:34.700 --> 01:32:36.100]  It's always about security.
[01:32:36.100 --> 01:32:38.660]  Whether it's for yourself, your wife, your loved ones.
[01:32:38.660 --> 01:32:41.020]  Go to their website, hdfirearms.com,
[01:32:41.020 --> 01:32:42.340]  buy right off their website.
[01:32:42.340 --> 01:32:45.460]  And they'll just send it to the FFL dealer of your choice.
[01:32:45.460 --> 01:32:46.900]  You can pick it up at the gun show.
[01:32:46.900 --> 01:32:48.820]  You can pick it up at a local sporting goods store.
[01:32:48.820 --> 01:32:53.180]  Whatever you do, get your head down firearm today.
[01:32:53.180 --> 01:33:00.460]  The spirit of 1776 lives at head down firearms, hdfirearms.com.
[01:33:00.460 --> 01:33:09.220]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide,
[01:33:09.220 --> 01:33:12.460]  it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:12.460 --> 01:33:16.300]  I'm just an average man with an average life.
[01:33:16.300 --> 01:33:18.220]  I work from nine to five.
[01:33:18.220 --> 01:33:20.180]  Hell, I pay the price.
[01:33:20.180 --> 01:33:24.020]  All I want is to be left alone in my average home.
[01:33:24.020 --> 01:33:27.460]  But why do I always feel like I'm in the twilight soon?
[01:33:27.460 --> 01:33:35.460]  I always feel like somebody's watching me, and I'm surprised.
[01:33:35.460 --> 01:33:36.460]  I always feel like I'm in the twilight soon.
[01:33:36.460 --> 01:33:40.900]  Kirk Wiebe, high level NSA whistleblower,
[01:33:40.900 --> 01:33:42.900]  who tried to internally work through the government
[01:33:42.900 --> 01:33:47.180]  with his colleagues, and was basically persecuted for it.
[01:33:47.180 --> 01:33:48.700]  I want to spend some time on that just
[01:33:48.700 --> 01:33:50.860]  to look at what they're doing to the press, what
[01:33:50.860 --> 01:33:53.340]  they're doing to whistleblowers, that are exposing programs
[01:33:53.340 --> 01:33:53.980]  that were illegal.
[01:33:53.980 --> 01:33:55.940]  The courts have said this now.
[01:33:55.940 --> 01:33:58.940]  They play on the public's ignorance, and have Obama
[01:33:58.940 --> 01:34:01.020]  and Mitch McConnell and others get up there and say,
[01:34:01.020 --> 01:34:02.780]  none of this is happening.
[01:34:02.780 --> 01:34:04.220]  Kirk, you got cut off by the break.
[01:34:04.220 --> 01:34:05.540]  Recap what you were saying.
[01:34:05.540 --> 01:34:09.100]  And no need to pause for the next 10 minutes if you want.
[01:34:09.100 --> 01:34:12.660]  You can have the floor and give us a speech or a breakdown
[01:34:12.660 --> 01:34:15.380]  as an insider on where we're going, what's happening.
[01:34:15.380 --> 01:34:18.380]  You were making the point, if folks just joined us,
[01:34:18.380 --> 01:34:21.460]  that for many decades they've been doing illegal stuff,
[01:34:21.460 --> 01:34:23.980]  please elaborate on that.
[01:34:23.980 --> 01:34:27.020]  Yeah, it began right after World War II.
[01:34:27.020 --> 01:34:31.900]  Some argue maybe the last year or so, World War II,
[01:34:31.900 --> 01:34:36.780]  the NSA and its predecessor organizations
[01:34:36.780 --> 01:34:39.780]  were monitoring or began monitoring
[01:34:39.780 --> 01:34:44.580]  all outgoing communications from the United States,
[01:34:44.580 --> 01:34:47.540]  all, both ends of the conversation.
[01:34:47.540 --> 01:34:50.900]  They were monitoring Martin Luther King.
[01:34:50.900 --> 01:34:56.140]  They were monitoring Vietnam War protesters.
[01:34:56.140 --> 01:35:00.380]  They even monitored the guy we all
[01:35:00.380 --> 01:35:05.780]  looked to who tried to stop this illegal activity,
[01:35:05.780 --> 01:35:10.100]  Senator Frank Church himself.
[01:35:10.100 --> 01:35:17.220]  And so here we have a period from about 1947 to 1975,
[01:35:17.220 --> 01:35:20.260]  where we're operating illegally until it's discovered
[01:35:20.260 --> 01:35:25.980]  and the Congress becomes furious, led by Senator Frank Church.
[01:35:25.980 --> 01:35:29.460]  And he quoted all the dangers of tyrannical governments,
[01:35:29.460 --> 01:35:32.180]  and he pointed to Hitler and so forth and so on,
[01:35:32.180 --> 01:35:34.140]  how people with this kind of power
[01:35:34.140 --> 01:35:37.900]  can undermine the whole type of government we have
[01:35:37.900 --> 01:35:39.580]  and have done so.
[01:35:39.580 --> 01:35:42.740]  Because the only reason you want to collect everything
[01:35:42.740 --> 01:35:47.500]  about everybody is to control them, to control populations.
[01:35:47.500 --> 01:35:49.900]  Why else do it?
[01:35:49.900 --> 01:35:52.780]  So then we have the reform.
[01:35:52.780 --> 01:35:55.500]  We have the intelligence committees created
[01:35:55.500 --> 01:35:57.460]  by the Frank Church committee.
[01:35:57.460 --> 01:36:02.020]  We draw up rules where Admiral Bobby Inman
[01:36:02.020 --> 01:36:06.740]  helped define what NSA calls UCID 18, which
[01:36:06.740 --> 01:36:10.700]  governs under what circumstances NSA
[01:36:10.700 --> 01:36:13.460]  may collect information about a US citizen.
[01:36:13.460 --> 01:36:17.420]  And it's very well-defined and understood.
[01:36:17.420 --> 01:36:21.020]  And it was actually our Bible that we lived by.
[01:36:21.020 --> 01:36:23.060]  Of course, we had plenty of foreign intelligence
[01:36:23.060 --> 01:36:25.420]  to worry about, so that was really
[01:36:25.420 --> 01:36:27.620]  my concern during my career.
[01:36:27.620 --> 01:36:29.820]  However, now what's changed?
[01:36:29.820 --> 01:36:32.940]  So we spin forward to 2015, and we
[01:36:32.940 --> 01:36:36.980]  have a Congress who's going to great lengths
[01:36:36.980 --> 01:36:41.660]  to protect NSA's ability and the FBI's ability and the DEA
[01:36:41.660 --> 01:36:44.300]  and all of them to collect everything.
[01:36:44.300 --> 01:36:48.100]  What's changed? What makes up a senator today
[01:36:48.100 --> 01:36:51.100]  that is so different from 40 years ago
[01:36:51.100 --> 01:36:54.140]  when they were appalled at what was going on?
[01:36:54.140 --> 01:36:55.820]  Is it ethics?
[01:36:55.820 --> 01:36:57.900]  Is it the influence of money?
[01:36:57.900 --> 01:37:00.740]  Well, I think we know some of the answer to all of that.
[01:37:00.740 --> 01:37:04.380]  All I'm trying to say is, if we didn't run out and collect
[01:37:04.380 --> 01:37:07.220]  everybody's phone numbers in 1979
[01:37:07.220 --> 01:37:11.460]  after Smith versus Maryland, why are we doing it now?
[01:37:11.460 --> 01:37:13.220]  And continuing to do it.
[01:37:13.220 --> 01:37:16.860]  And I would argue it's hurting NSA.
[01:37:16.860 --> 01:37:19.300]  It's hurting the FBI, because they're
[01:37:19.300 --> 01:37:22.660]  collecting so much data, they can't understand it anymore.
[01:37:22.660 --> 01:37:25.140]  And it explains why they didn't stop,
[01:37:25.140 --> 01:37:28.980]  not pick up the pieces later, but prevent the Boston
[01:37:28.980 --> 01:37:32.100]  Marathon that killed that little eight-year-old boy
[01:37:32.100 --> 01:37:35.940]  and three others, why they didn't stop the maiming
[01:37:35.940 --> 01:37:41.740]  of our troops at Fort Hood and Charlie Hebdo in France.
[01:37:41.740 --> 01:37:43.180]  That's foreign intelligence.
[01:37:43.180 --> 01:37:45.220]  That's NSA's bailing way.
[01:37:45.220 --> 01:37:50.860]  Or Garland, the FBI, and I mean, they were on Twitter
[01:37:50.860 --> 01:37:54.340]  and Facebook saying they were about to do it a day before.
[01:37:54.340 --> 01:37:57.500]  And only the local cops figured it out and were waiting.
[01:37:57.500 --> 01:38:00.260]  The FBI had so much data, they weren't even there.
[01:38:00.260 --> 01:38:01.660]  Absolutely right.
[01:38:01.660 --> 01:38:05.540]  So I don't know how Mitch McConnell and Marco Rubio
[01:38:05.540 --> 01:38:07.500]  and people stand up with a straight face.
[01:38:07.500 --> 01:38:08.780]  Shame on them.
[01:38:08.780 --> 01:38:10.940]  Shame on them.
[01:38:10.940 --> 01:38:11.780]  Please continue, sir.
[01:38:11.780 --> 01:38:12.380]  You're the expert.
[01:38:12.380 --> 01:38:13.140]  This is amazing.
[01:38:13.140 --> 01:38:15.340]  I mean, you're talking to millions of folks.
[01:38:15.340 --> 01:38:18.220]  What do they need to know right now about what's happening?
[01:38:18.220 --> 01:38:24.060]  Well, I want people to know that when Hayden came into NSA,
[01:38:24.060 --> 01:38:26.860]  it really began with him.
[01:38:26.860 --> 01:38:29.700]  You could say it was 9-11, rubbish.
[01:38:29.700 --> 01:38:33.100]  NSA had all the data.
[01:38:33.100 --> 01:38:35.180]  Thomas Drake was still there, even
[01:38:35.180 --> 01:38:37.780]  though we had retired the other three of us.
[01:38:37.780 --> 01:38:40.300]  Drake was still at NSA.
[01:38:40.300 --> 01:38:44.940]  He witnessed the fact that NSA had the data about 9-11
[01:38:44.940 --> 01:38:46.900]  and didn't tell anybody.
[01:38:46.900 --> 01:38:49.780]  And so we hear all of this, we can't have another 9-11.
[01:38:49.780 --> 01:38:51.380]  What are you talking about?
[01:38:51.380 --> 01:38:56.860]  Now, no journalist that I know of has ever asked General Hayden,
[01:38:56.860 --> 01:39:01.740]  what about this business about you having the data about 9-11?
[01:39:01.740 --> 01:39:04.460]  No one has ever put him in the corner
[01:39:04.460 --> 01:39:06.660]  and forced him to answer that question.
[01:39:06.660 --> 01:39:08.540]  And it needs to be done by somebody.
[01:39:08.540 --> 01:39:11.540]  We are being lied to right from the get-go.
[01:39:11.540 --> 01:39:13.980]  So who is it that's really behind this effort
[01:39:13.980 --> 01:39:15.260]  to get all this data?
[01:39:15.260 --> 01:39:17.940]  I personally believe it's law enforcement.
[01:39:17.940 --> 01:39:22.620]  NSA really, I don't think, has a lot of interest in Americans.
[01:39:22.620 --> 01:39:27.220]  I think they have more to do than it's possible,
[01:39:27.220 --> 01:39:29.820]  just looking at ISIS and other things abroad.
[01:39:29.820 --> 01:39:31.420]  And we have China arising.
[01:39:31.420 --> 01:39:33.180]  We have Russia causing trouble.
[01:39:33.180 --> 01:39:36.380]  Plenty of stuff to do and play in overseas.
[01:39:36.380 --> 01:39:37.940]  So who is it that's pushing?
[01:39:37.940 --> 01:39:39.260]  It's law enforcement.
[01:39:39.260 --> 01:39:40.820]  Why?
[01:39:40.820 --> 01:39:43.660]  Heartened back to the colonial period,
[01:39:43.660 --> 01:39:46.420]  when King George III of England said,
[01:39:46.420 --> 01:39:49.300]  I need to know who's rabble-rousing in the colonies.
[01:39:49.300 --> 01:39:51.660]  I'm going to put a soldier in every home.
[01:39:51.660 --> 01:39:54.540]  Well, that was the straw that broke the economy.
[01:39:54.540 --> 01:39:56.380]  It's about domestic control.
[01:39:56.380 --> 01:39:59.260]  And it's admitted with the threat fusion centers,
[01:39:59.260 --> 01:40:01.980]  the more and more departments are being given access
[01:40:01.980 --> 01:40:03.060]  to the NSA data.
[01:40:03.060 --> 01:40:04.740]  And I want you to continue down that line, sir,
[01:40:04.740 --> 01:40:08.060]  but then bring up the fact that this is a layperson.
[01:40:08.060 --> 01:40:10.460]  If you've got 800,000 private contractors
[01:40:10.460 --> 01:40:13.260]  and all these agencies and the DEA and the FBI,
[01:40:13.260 --> 01:40:16.020]  and we know all these groups have corporate moles,
[01:40:16.020 --> 01:40:19.460]  cult moles, crazy people, psychopaths, criminals,
[01:40:19.460 --> 01:40:23.740]  it's a sieve now to have America be totally penetrated
[01:40:23.740 --> 01:40:25.620]  by anybody and everybody.
[01:40:25.620 --> 01:40:28.380]  I mean, it's like building 1,000 doors on your house.
[01:40:28.380 --> 01:40:32.740]  Or it just sounds like it's the opposite of security to me.
[01:40:32.740 --> 01:40:33.580]  It is.
[01:40:33.580 --> 01:40:36.900]  It truly is, Alex.
[01:40:36.900 --> 01:40:41.380]  And the borders, we could talk endlessly.
[01:40:41.380 --> 01:40:43.180]  Hiring rules are being changed
[01:40:43.180 --> 01:40:44.860]  because they're discriminatory.
[01:40:45.780 --> 01:40:48.100]  People are getting security clearances
[01:40:48.100 --> 01:40:49.300]  that shouldn't be getting them.
[01:40:49.300 --> 01:40:51.460]  How do some of these people get clearances?
[01:40:51.460 --> 01:40:54.580]  Because favoritism inside the government,
[01:40:54.580 --> 01:40:58.340]  and it all eats away at our governmental strength,
[01:40:58.340 --> 01:40:59.940]  our national strength.
[01:40:59.940 --> 01:41:02.580]  Look at what he's doing in the military, Obama.
[01:41:02.580 --> 01:41:04.020]  He's tearing it apart.
[01:41:04.020 --> 01:41:09.020]  He's removed very patriotic general officers,
[01:41:09.340 --> 01:41:10.860]  the highest among them.
[01:41:10.860 --> 01:41:13.220]  And all of this is purposeful.
[01:41:13.220 --> 01:41:14.740]  This is not a act to gamble.
[01:41:15.780 --> 01:41:16.780]  Incredible.
[01:41:16.780 --> 01:41:17.740]  Elaborate on that.
[01:41:17.740 --> 01:41:20.820]  I mean, making the troops wear red, high-hill shoes
[01:41:20.820 --> 01:41:23.860]  in public, sensitivity training,
[01:41:23.860 --> 01:41:25.260]  cutting their funding for training,
[01:41:25.260 --> 01:41:26.980]  well, giving them too many missions,
[01:41:26.980 --> 01:41:28.820]  shutting off our power plants,
[01:41:28.820 --> 01:41:33.820]  not letting the feds are trying to create crises
[01:41:34.940 --> 01:41:36.340]  with the states.
[01:41:36.340 --> 01:41:39.620]  Really, I see it as a global corporate takeover of America.
[01:41:39.620 --> 01:41:42.660]  The corporations now have access to this data.
[01:41:42.660 --> 01:41:44.740]  They're now working with the NSA.
[01:41:44.740 --> 01:41:46.540]  It sounds like they want this
[01:41:46.540 --> 01:41:49.540]  because it allows a corporate takeover of the country.
[01:41:49.540 --> 01:41:52.740]  It really does, and you're absolutely right about that.
[01:41:52.740 --> 01:41:55.420]  And you know, if you look back into history,
[01:41:55.420 --> 01:41:58.340]  what do we call it when governments get
[01:41:58.340 --> 01:42:01.860]  too far into bed with industry and business?
[01:42:01.860 --> 01:42:02.700]  Fascism.
[01:42:02.700 --> 01:42:03.540]  That's right.
[01:42:03.540 --> 01:42:06.340]  And if you look at the rise of the police state,
[01:42:06.340 --> 01:42:08.980]  how they, even the police, and God love them,
[01:42:08.980 --> 01:42:12.140]  I respect the police and honor them,
[01:42:12.140 --> 01:42:15.100]  but there is a certain segment of the police
[01:42:15.100 --> 01:42:18.500]  that's become paramilitary,
[01:42:18.500 --> 01:42:22.580]  and they've become rough with otherwise innocent people.
[01:42:22.580 --> 01:42:25.620]  And I'm not talking about the gray case over there
[01:42:25.620 --> 01:42:27.300]  in Baltimore and so forth.
[01:42:27.300 --> 01:42:28.500]  I'm talking about.
[01:42:28.500 --> 01:42:30.620]  But sure, I mean, they're giving a military killer training,
[01:42:30.620 --> 01:42:33.500]  and then it's being deployed against old ladies and stuff.
[01:42:33.500 --> 01:42:34.820]  Exactly.
[01:42:34.820 --> 01:42:37.100]  All I'm saying is if you stand back
[01:42:37.100 --> 01:42:40.660]  and you look at the behavior of authoritarian
[01:42:41.500 --> 01:42:46.100]  organizations of any type, they've become nasty.
[01:42:46.100 --> 01:42:48.740]  We used to be a sort of a kind understanding
[01:42:48.740 --> 01:42:50.420]  and wise nation.
[01:42:50.420 --> 01:42:51.260]  And you know-
[01:42:51.260 --> 01:42:53.180]  That's it, we need soft power,
[01:42:53.180 --> 01:42:56.940]  and we need, like the sheriff of Mayberry,
[01:42:56.940 --> 01:43:01.940]  we don't need to be his deputy in a black uniform.
[01:43:03.540 --> 01:43:05.420]  Absolutely.
[01:43:05.420 --> 01:43:08.140]  But something about the events of 9-11
[01:43:08.140 --> 01:43:10.420]  and the ginning up the patriotism,
[01:43:10.420 --> 01:43:12.620]  and that we've got to stop all of us,
[01:43:12.620 --> 01:43:15.060]  has gotten a bit out of control.
[01:43:15.060 --> 01:43:17.420]  The pendulum has swung a bit too far.
[01:43:17.420 --> 01:43:19.260]  We're taking military surplus
[01:43:19.260 --> 01:43:21.020]  and giving it to the police department,
[01:43:21.020 --> 01:43:24.260]  and they're writing down in small towns
[01:43:24.260 --> 01:43:27.340]  in Midwest America, in a Humvee
[01:43:27.340 --> 01:43:29.460]  that's armored up and so forth.
[01:43:29.460 --> 01:43:31.340]  And I'm sure that's fun.
[01:43:31.340 --> 01:43:33.900]  But think about what it represents.
[01:43:33.900 --> 01:43:36.020]  A major cultural shift towards what we see
[01:43:36.020 --> 01:43:38.940]  in North Korea and other third world hellholes.
[01:43:38.940 --> 01:43:41.700]  Expanding on that, every marker of a country
[01:43:41.700 --> 01:43:43.580]  sliding into tyranny is there.
[01:43:43.580 --> 01:43:46.100]  It's accelerating, but I've studied history
[01:43:46.100 --> 01:43:47.420]  as I know you have, sir.
[01:43:47.420 --> 01:43:50.260]  The elite should know, I know it's a fractured elite,
[01:43:50.260 --> 01:43:53.020]  but the establishment, and special hunters should know,
[01:43:53.020 --> 01:43:54.620]  they're building a police state
[01:43:54.620 --> 01:43:57.780]  that generally eats the establishment first
[01:43:57.780 --> 01:44:02.780]  and is dangerous and destroys their security as well.
[01:44:03.180 --> 01:44:05.220]  Look at Al Hastert, we now learn,
[01:44:05.220 --> 01:44:08.060]  got stung basically by Patriot Act type stuff
[01:44:08.060 --> 01:44:09.220]  and know your customer stuff.
[01:44:09.220 --> 01:44:10.900]  And I'm not defending Hastert,
[01:44:10.900 --> 01:44:12.420]  but it's better that 10 guilty men
[01:44:12.420 --> 01:44:14.140]  go free than one innocent man.
[01:44:14.140 --> 01:44:16.100]  I mean, does it Congress we now learn
[01:44:16.100 --> 01:44:18.340]  has been spied on by the CIA and others?
[01:44:18.340 --> 01:44:19.780]  Don't they understand?
[01:44:19.780 --> 01:44:23.060]  They're gonna get hoisted on their own petard?
[01:44:23.060 --> 01:44:25.500]  You know, it's a good question,
[01:44:25.500 --> 01:44:28.420]  but I think they're afraid.
[01:44:28.420 --> 01:44:32.220]  I mean, there's so few, what I would call,
[01:44:32.220 --> 01:44:36.620]  brave people anymore in Congress and elsewhere.
[01:44:36.620 --> 01:44:38.180]  I always look to the military
[01:44:38.180 --> 01:44:41.220]  if I wanna find brave souls, I can't find them anywhere.
[01:44:43.340 --> 01:44:45.940]  It's like our school curriculums,
[01:44:45.940 --> 01:44:49.780]  the behavior that we're teaching is all puffery.
[01:44:49.780 --> 01:44:51.380]  It's about feelings.
[01:44:51.380 --> 01:44:55.540]  It's not about dedication, courage, integrity, honesty.
[01:44:55.540 --> 01:44:57.420]  The things that always made us,
[01:44:57.420 --> 01:45:01.900]  how did the World War II guys become the greatest generation
[01:45:01.900 --> 01:45:03.780]  because they stood tall?
[01:45:03.780 --> 01:45:05.780]  And they had integrity and they were hardworking
[01:45:05.780 --> 01:45:06.900]  and they were honorable.
[01:45:06.900 --> 01:45:09.820]  That's the essence of freedom and civilization.
[01:45:09.820 --> 01:45:11.900]  Why would the political class
[01:45:11.900 --> 01:45:15.340]  wanna kill the blood of freedom?
[01:45:15.340 --> 01:45:17.300]  Exactly, and it's for money.
[01:45:17.300 --> 01:45:18.580]  You pointed it out.
[01:45:18.580 --> 01:45:20.780]  The undue influence of industry.
[01:45:20.780 --> 01:45:24.340]  You know, Hayden actually broke NSA
[01:45:24.340 --> 01:45:26.700]  and he did it because he let industry
[01:45:26.700 --> 01:45:29.220]  too far inside the building.
[01:45:29.220 --> 01:45:30.980]  And now they're an integral part of it.
[01:45:30.980 --> 01:45:35.260]  My God, there are industry contractors actually
[01:45:35.260 --> 01:45:37.820]  doing intelligence analysis,
[01:45:37.820 --> 01:45:40.580]  partly because analysts have found out
[01:45:40.580 --> 01:45:42.460]  that if they go to work on a contract,
[01:45:42.460 --> 01:45:44.260]  they can get a higher paycheck.
[01:45:44.260 --> 01:45:47.820]  The long-term benefits may not be as good in the package,
[01:45:47.820 --> 01:45:50.780]  but the paycheck's higher and people want money.
[01:45:50.780 --> 01:45:54.380]  So it's a corporate takeover of national security?
[01:45:54.380 --> 01:45:56.980]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[01:45:56.980 --> 01:46:00.700]  And Hayden himself, look what happens to Hayden.
[01:46:00.700 --> 01:46:03.860]  He goes into NSA, screws it up.
[01:46:03.860 --> 01:46:06.380]  He invents something called trailblazer
[01:46:06.380 --> 01:46:08.740]  that began as PowerPoint slides,
[01:46:08.740 --> 01:46:12.140]  claiming it was gonna save the country in the digital age.
[01:46:12.140 --> 01:46:15.420]  When the solution he needed, Benny had already developed
[01:46:15.420 --> 01:46:17.860]  in that little research organization,
[01:46:17.860 --> 01:46:19.940]  and it was right there for the plucking.
[01:46:19.940 --> 01:46:23.100]  He ignored it, threw it out, went with trailblazer,
[01:46:23.100 --> 01:46:25.220]  spent millions of dollars,
[01:46:25.220 --> 01:46:30.220]  and the whole thing was declared a failure in 2005,
[01:46:30.660 --> 01:46:33.580]  producing the biggest failure
[01:46:33.580 --> 01:46:34.660]  in the history of the national security.
[01:46:34.660 --> 01:46:35.500]  Well, just as Benny said,
[01:46:35.500 --> 01:46:36.860]  they don't wanna solve problems,
[01:46:36.860 --> 01:46:38.980]  they wanna keep making them worse.
[01:46:38.980 --> 01:46:41.820]  Exactly, and he gets promoted
[01:46:41.820 --> 01:46:44.580]  and then goes on to become deputy director
[01:46:44.580 --> 01:46:46.420]  of national intelligence.
[01:46:46.420 --> 01:46:48.700]  At that point, it was Negroponte,
[01:46:48.700 --> 01:46:50.540]  and he's sitting at his side,
[01:46:50.540 --> 01:46:52.660]  eventually it becomes Jim Clapper,
[01:46:52.660 --> 01:46:56.060]  as Hayden then goes on to become the director of CIA.
[01:46:56.060 --> 01:47:00.220]  So there's a new, a new concept
[01:47:00.220 --> 01:47:03.700]  that's been born called failing upwards.
[01:47:03.700 --> 01:47:06.380]  The more you fail, the more money you waste,
[01:47:06.380 --> 01:47:10.020]  the more business you bring and involve in the money flow,
[01:47:10.020 --> 01:47:11.540]  you get rewarded.
[01:47:11.540 --> 01:47:14.500]  That's what we've done, and that's where we are.
[01:47:14.500 --> 01:47:17.100]  And the country is totally bankrupt
[01:47:17.100 --> 01:47:19.500]  and they're accelerating a collapse,
[01:47:19.500 --> 01:47:21.420]  and then they think a bunch of armored vehicles
[01:47:21.420 --> 01:47:23.260]  and paramilitary to keep them safe.
[01:47:23.260 --> 01:47:24.940]  Nothing's gonna keep them safe
[01:47:24.940 --> 01:47:26.420]  when this all blows sky high,
[01:47:26.420 --> 01:47:31.100]  which it will, the question is just when it is scary.
[01:47:31.100 --> 01:47:33.100]  And then I see elites all running to the hills
[01:47:33.100 --> 01:47:35.060]  and building armored redoubts and safe houses
[01:47:35.060 --> 01:47:36.620]  and going to New Zealand.
[01:47:36.620 --> 01:47:38.340]  It's all these special interests
[01:47:38.340 --> 01:47:42.140]  who can't help but make themselves wealthy
[01:47:42.140 --> 01:47:44.140]  and they don't care about the long-term issue.
[01:47:44.140 --> 01:47:46.260]  It just sounds like a time bomb.
[01:47:46.260 --> 01:47:48.540]  Well, it is, and it's getting worse.
[01:47:48.540 --> 01:47:51.500]  And people say, what can we do about it?
[01:47:51.500 --> 01:47:53.820]  And normally you'd say, well, call your congressman.
[01:47:53.820 --> 01:47:56.620]  I don't know that that can do anything about it anymore.
[01:47:56.620 --> 01:48:01.620]  I fear we're headed down that path of last resort
[01:48:02.220 --> 01:48:04.860]  where if you look to how we're gonna deal with this,
[01:48:04.860 --> 01:48:07.460]  we're gonna have to march on Washington.
[01:48:07.460 --> 01:48:09.940]  And I don't know if you're gonna pick up a pitchfork,
[01:48:09.940 --> 01:48:12.540]  a baseball bat or what to do it,
[01:48:12.540 --> 01:48:16.180]  but we've got to start making our voices heard.
[01:48:16.180 --> 01:48:17.980]  We've got to get their attention.
[01:48:17.980 --> 01:48:20.220]  You know, I would love,
[01:48:20.220 --> 01:48:23.860]  I would probably give my life for the opportunity
[01:48:23.860 --> 01:48:27.420]  for Bill Benny to be invited to Congress.
[01:48:27.420 --> 01:48:30.860]  And why wouldn't they?
[01:48:30.860 --> 01:48:32.620]  The guys are genius.
[01:48:32.620 --> 01:48:37.620]  We know how to do this job called intelligence in big data.
[01:48:37.980 --> 01:48:41.300]  Catch bad guys protect privacy at the same time
[01:48:41.300 --> 01:48:43.220]  without giving up anything.
[01:48:43.220 --> 01:48:46.060]  And they won't even talk to him.
[01:48:46.060 --> 01:48:50.060]  They won't even invite him in, not even a closed session.
[01:48:50.060 --> 01:48:52.380]  And he's the guy that invented most of the systems
[01:48:52.380 --> 01:48:54.260]  that they're getting rich off of.
[01:48:54.260 --> 01:48:55.260]  Exactly.
[01:48:55.260 --> 01:48:57.860]  And he didn't invent them for this purpose.
[01:48:57.860 --> 01:49:00.420]  We built the protections in.
[01:49:00.420 --> 01:49:01.260]  And my God-
[01:49:01.260 --> 01:49:03.460]  I know it's all classified, but basically I get into
[01:49:03.460 --> 01:49:05.660]  algorithms and all the rest of it,
[01:49:05.660 --> 01:49:09.220]  where you can really zone in on the algorithm
[01:49:09.220 --> 01:49:10.940]  of the real bad guys.
[01:49:10.940 --> 01:49:13.460]  But when you add all the data, it just screws it up,
[01:49:13.460 --> 01:49:15.260]  which then shows you that-
[01:49:15.260 --> 01:49:16.300]  Yeah, go ahead.
[01:49:16.300 --> 01:49:17.900]  No, no, you're absolutely right.
[01:49:17.900 --> 01:49:22.900]  You have to know how to process and leverage the data
[01:49:23.700 --> 01:49:28.540]  to deal with the three Vs is what I call it.
[01:49:28.540 --> 01:49:32.140]  Velocity, this stuff moves down electronic pipes
[01:49:32.140 --> 01:49:34.500]  the speed of light, the variety.
[01:49:34.500 --> 01:49:36.660]  Look at all the stuff you can do with your smartphone.
[01:49:36.660 --> 01:49:38.140]  You want to tweet, you want to chat,
[01:49:38.140 --> 01:49:41.180]  you want to look at maps, you want to whatever.
[01:49:41.180 --> 01:49:43.220]  Oh, and make phone calls by the way.
[01:49:44.380 --> 01:49:49.060]  And the variety of data and the velocity and the volume,
[01:49:49.060 --> 01:49:51.900]  we can't keep up with our email cues.
[01:49:51.900 --> 01:49:55.500]  Imagine if you're collecting the world's communications,
[01:49:55.500 --> 01:49:57.140]  how much there's out there.
[01:49:57.140 --> 01:50:00.940]  We devised ways to deal with that
[01:50:01.820 --> 01:50:04.060]  and to do it constitutionally.
[01:50:04.060 --> 01:50:08.140]  Why does no one, no one want to talk about that?
[01:50:09.140 --> 01:50:12.100]  Because it's too inexpensive to do it that way.
[01:50:12.100 --> 01:50:13.660]  And it's better to have a giant white elephant
[01:50:13.660 --> 01:50:14.980]  that doesn't work.
[01:50:14.980 --> 01:50:17.180]  And then all the other criminals that are in the government
[01:50:17.180 --> 01:50:19.460]  and the banks laundering money, running drugs,
[01:50:19.460 --> 01:50:22.060]  they don't have to worry about a real NSA anymore
[01:50:22.060 --> 01:50:25.140]  when they operate overseas because it's been blinded
[01:50:25.140 --> 01:50:27.620]  and infiltrated by their operatives.
[01:50:27.620 --> 01:50:29.340]  Absolutely right.
[01:50:29.340 --> 01:50:30.500]  Absolutely right.
[01:50:32.060 --> 01:50:34.860]  It's the fall of the Republic, final segment
[01:50:34.860 --> 01:50:36.540]  with Kirk Wiebe, an incredible patriot
[01:50:36.540 --> 01:50:37.900]  who I hope will come back routinely.
[01:50:37.900 --> 01:50:41.300]  This guy is amazing with all of his information
[01:50:41.300 --> 01:50:44.700]  at accuracy.org, expose facts.org, retweet it.
[01:50:44.700 --> 01:50:47.060]  We tweeted it out at real Alex Jones.
[01:50:47.060 --> 01:50:49.820]  It's up to you folks to turn this around.
[01:50:49.820 --> 01:50:51.380]  Maybe you can do five more minutes to the next hour
[01:50:51.380 --> 01:50:53.460]  because I wanted to talk about the persecution
[01:50:53.460 --> 01:50:55.980]  these guys went through for going internally
[01:50:55.980 --> 01:50:58.260]  through Congress, blowing the whistle.
[01:51:00.580 --> 01:51:02.380]  Communist China freely allows the sale
[01:51:02.380 --> 01:51:05.300]  of bulletproof armor plates, while our US politicians
[01:51:05.300 --> 01:51:07.860]  argue from banning Americans from owning body armor.
[01:51:07.860 --> 01:51:09.420]  Does that sound right to you?
[01:51:09.420 --> 01:51:12.820]  Arm your American body at infidelbodyarmor.com.
[01:51:12.820 --> 01:51:16.140]  Infidel Body Armor, just won't quit.
[01:51:16.140 --> 01:51:18.500]  Hi, Ted Anderson with Midas Resources.
[01:51:18.500 --> 01:51:21.500]  Is it time to convert paper 401Ks and IRAs
[01:51:21.500 --> 01:51:23.220]  to solid gold and silver yet?

[01:51:32.380 --> 01:51:34.100]  Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?
[01:51:34.100 --> 01:51:35.740]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[01:51:35.740 --> 01:51:38.580]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[01:51:38.580 --> 01:51:40.820]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[01:51:40.820 --> 01:51:43.260]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you,
[01:51:43.260 --> 01:51:45.380]  there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[01:51:45.380 --> 01:51:49.340]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.
[01:51:49.340 --> 01:51:51.420]  With the IRS's new programs, there's never been
[01:51:51.420 --> 01:51:53.100]  a better time to solve your problem.
[01:51:53.100 --> 01:51:57.260]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX, that's 800-34-NO-TAX
[01:51:57.260 --> 01:51:59.860]  or my website, danpilla.com.
[01:52:00.700 --> 01:52:01.540]  Hey, how you doing?
[01:52:01.540 --> 01:52:02.380]  Good, brother.
[01:52:02.380 --> 01:52:04.100]  Just recently started using your products.
[01:52:04.100 --> 01:52:05.820]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[01:52:05.820 --> 01:52:08.060]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them
[01:52:08.060 --> 01:52:09.980]  and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[01:52:09.980 --> 01:52:10.820]  Well, thank you, brother.
[01:52:10.820 --> 01:52:12.500]  It's because it also funds our operation,
[01:52:12.500 --> 01:52:14.780]  but doing that, I know I'm gonna have the highest quality.
[01:52:14.780 --> 01:52:17.220]  Supermail vitality was developed
[01:52:17.220 --> 01:52:20.820]  to activate your body's own natural processes
[01:52:20.820 --> 01:52:23.180]  instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:52:23.180 --> 01:52:26.340]  We do the super mail and the super female vitality.
[01:52:26.340 --> 01:52:27.860]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[01:52:27.860 --> 01:52:29.980]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks,
[01:52:29.980 --> 01:52:32.420]  energy shots, statement, ton of money there.
[01:52:32.420 --> 01:52:35.260]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs,
[01:52:35.260 --> 01:52:37.060]  harvested around the planet
[01:52:37.060 --> 01:52:40.420]  and then concentrated or maximum potency.
[01:52:40.420 --> 01:52:43.500]  They wanna stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff
[01:52:43.500 --> 01:52:44.940]  just cover that up for a while,
[01:52:44.940 --> 01:52:46.860]  but then burn you out in my experience,
[01:52:46.860 --> 01:52:49.580]  whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going
[01:52:49.580 --> 01:52:50.660]  goes right to the source.
[01:52:50.660 --> 01:52:52.420]  So it's pretty exciting and I love it.
[01:52:52.420 --> 01:52:54.900]  Visit infowarsalife.com today
[01:52:54.900 --> 01:52:56.940]  to secure your super mail vitality
[01:52:56.940 --> 01:53:00.460]  and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[01:53:00.460 --> 01:53:02.420]  It's very easy to be a criminal.
[01:53:02.420 --> 01:53:04.060]  All you need to burglarize a home
[01:53:04.060 --> 01:53:07.380]  is one simple household tool, a pair of scissors.
[01:53:07.380 --> 01:53:09.620]  If your home security system can be compromised
[01:53:09.620 --> 01:53:11.180]  by a criminal using scissors,
[01:53:11.180 --> 01:53:13.180]  then you're making it easy for them.
[01:53:13.180 --> 01:53:15.180]  Almost every home security system,
[01:53:15.180 --> 01:53:18.140]  even those sold by big name companies, has a weakness.
[01:53:18.140 --> 01:53:20.940]  The phone line, you shell out 1500 bucks,
[01:53:20.940 --> 01:53:24.340]  get locked into a long-term contract and think you're safe.
[01:53:24.340 --> 01:53:27.340]  But a burglar can destroy your alarm in seconds
[01:53:27.340 --> 01:53:30.140]  with one snip and when a burglar cuts your phone line,
[01:53:30.140 --> 01:53:31.580]  you're defenseless.
[01:53:31.580 --> 01:53:34.100]  Simply safe home security is the smarter choice.
[01:53:34.100 --> 01:53:35.500]  Built by Harvard engineers,
[01:53:35.500 --> 01:53:38.380]  simply safe uses a wireless connection to call the cops.
[01:53:38.380 --> 01:53:41.500]  Scissors can't cut it and that means your home stays safe.
[01:53:41.500 --> 01:53:44.660]  24-7 professional monitoring is under $15 a month
[01:53:44.660 --> 01:53:45.740]  with no contract.
[01:53:45.740 --> 01:53:49.260]  Simply safe home security keeps you safer than the other guys.
[01:53:49.260 --> 01:53:51.700]  For half the cost, protect your home with the alarm
[01:53:51.700 --> 01:53:52.540]  you can trust.
[01:53:52.540 --> 01:53:53.380]  Simply safe.

[01:54:00.620 --> 01:54:06.100]  We've got this segment and one more
[01:54:06.100 --> 01:54:08.780]  with NSA, whistleblower, Kirk, Levy.
[01:54:08.780 --> 01:54:10.700]  He's an amazing individual.
[01:54:10.700 --> 01:54:13.460]  And imagine being up there in DC or being in Maryland
[01:54:13.460 --> 01:54:14.380]  or being in other areas,
[01:54:14.380 --> 01:54:16.940]  surrounded by all these yes men and women
[01:54:16.940 --> 01:54:19.500]  and saying, no, I'm gonna tell the truth.
[01:54:19.500 --> 01:54:20.900]  As George Arwell said,
[01:54:20.900 --> 01:54:22.780]  in a world of universal deceit,
[01:54:22.780 --> 01:54:25.660]  telling the truth is a revolutionary act.
[01:54:25.660 --> 01:54:27.860]  Mark Twain probably said it even better.
[01:54:27.860 --> 01:54:30.180]  In the beginning, a patriot is a scarce man,
[01:54:30.180 --> 01:54:31.940]  hated, feared, and scorned.
[01:54:31.940 --> 01:54:34.260]  But in time, when his cause succeeds,
[01:54:34.260 --> 01:54:36.860]  the timid joined him because then it cost nothing
[01:54:36.860 --> 01:54:37.780]  to be a patriot.
[01:54:38.860 --> 01:54:40.100]  And I've studied history.
[01:54:40.100 --> 01:54:41.100]  I started reading history books
[01:54:41.100 --> 01:54:42.740]  when I was about six, seven years old.
[01:54:42.740 --> 01:54:44.220]  Kids history books, by the time I was 10,
[01:54:44.220 --> 01:54:45.700]  I was reading adult history books.
[01:54:45.700 --> 01:54:47.580]  I just found it to be fascinating,
[01:54:47.580 --> 01:54:51.460]  much better than science fiction or comic books.
[01:54:51.460 --> 01:54:53.900]  And by the time I was in high school and college,
[01:54:53.900 --> 01:54:56.340]  I saw the brainwashing and the tyranny
[01:54:56.340 --> 01:54:57.780]  and saw where we were going.
[01:54:57.780 --> 01:54:59.820]  So I've been on air since I was 21.
[01:54:59.820 --> 01:55:01.860]  I'm 41 now, 20 years.
[01:55:03.460 --> 01:55:06.220]  And I've just seen the slide of this nation.
[01:55:06.220 --> 01:55:08.540]  And it's all because I read history books.
[01:55:08.540 --> 01:55:10.500]  Those that don't know history are doomed to repeat it.
[01:55:10.500 --> 01:55:12.460]  I think Lord Acton said that.
[01:55:12.460 --> 01:55:13.660]  He also said power.
[01:55:13.660 --> 01:55:16.420]  He said absolute power corrupts absolutely.
[01:55:16.420 --> 01:55:17.740]  He said power tends to corrupt.
[01:55:17.740 --> 01:55:19.980]  Absolute power corrupts absolutely.
[01:55:19.980 --> 01:55:22.220]  I want to give Kirk and just the three or four minutes
[01:55:22.220 --> 01:55:24.740]  we have left here in the next little segment,
[01:55:24.740 --> 01:55:26.300]  any other points he wants to cover.
[01:55:26.300 --> 01:55:27.500]  I want to talk about the persecution.
[01:55:27.500 --> 01:55:29.980]  And that really illustrates how evil this government is.
[01:55:29.980 --> 01:55:32.140]  They follow the law, they go through Congress,
[01:55:32.140 --> 01:55:32.980]  people come after them.
[01:55:32.980 --> 01:55:37.300]  But briefly, we're supported in fullwarstore.com
[01:55:37.300 --> 01:55:39.700]  with the high quality shortwave radios,
[01:55:39.700 --> 01:55:44.060]  Patriot apparel, heirloom seeds, books, videos
[01:55:44.060 --> 01:55:46.220]  on every liberty subject you can imagine,
[01:55:46.220 --> 01:55:48.180]  super high quality vitamins and minerals,
[01:55:48.180 --> 01:55:49.380]  nutraceuticals.
[01:55:49.380 --> 01:55:50.740]  We're supported by your purchases.
[01:55:50.740 --> 01:55:51.980]  So shop with the good guys.
[01:55:51.980 --> 01:55:53.460]  We're a platform for freedom.
[01:55:53.460 --> 01:55:54.660]  Transcend, left, right.
[01:55:54.660 --> 01:55:58.180]  It's all about basic renaissance, basic transparency.
[01:55:58.180 --> 01:56:02.220]  In fullwarstore.com, our amazing deep earth source
[01:56:02.220 --> 01:56:04.980]  of iodine that's so pure and doesn't upset your stomach
[01:56:04.980 --> 01:56:06.820]  like other cruddy iodines.
[01:56:06.820 --> 01:56:09.300]  There's a lot of iodine deficiencies out there.
[01:56:09.300 --> 01:56:10.900]  We are selling out of our supply.
[01:56:10.900 --> 01:56:12.940]  We've had it for a couple of years.
[01:56:12.940 --> 01:56:14.180]  And now the deep earth crystals,
[01:56:14.180 --> 01:56:16.820]  we're trying to get another contract to get these.
[01:56:16.820 --> 01:56:17.780]  I don't know if we're going to be able
[01:56:17.780 --> 01:56:19.380]  to continue to supply it probably.
[01:56:19.380 --> 01:56:20.540]  But if you want to get it,
[01:56:20.540 --> 01:56:25.540]  now's the time, infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:56:26.780 --> 01:56:28.460]  Kirk, we got about three, four minutes to break
[01:56:28.460 --> 01:56:30.940]  and then a five more minutes segment.
[01:56:30.940 --> 01:56:33.060]  What do you want to hit in closing here?
[01:56:34.220 --> 01:56:37.820]  Well, we didn't talk a lot about USA Freedom,
[01:56:37.820 --> 01:56:41.100]  but I think you said that a previous guest had done that.
[01:56:41.100 --> 01:56:41.940]  Well, no, no.
[01:56:41.940 --> 01:56:43.180]  I don't want to get your take as an expert on it.
[01:56:43.180 --> 01:56:44.420]  What do you think of it?
[01:56:44.420 --> 01:56:46.540]  Yeah, well, I don't think very much of it.
[01:56:46.540 --> 01:56:50.300]  It doesn't change any, what makes me angry
[01:56:50.300 --> 01:56:51.940]  is that it's deceitful.
[01:56:51.940 --> 01:56:53.500]  It makes us all believe,
[01:56:53.500 --> 01:56:55.660]  because of the way the media treats it,
[01:56:55.660 --> 01:56:59.300]  as this is somehow finally Congress doing something
[01:56:59.300 --> 01:57:01.820]  to protect us, when in fact,
[01:57:01.820 --> 01:57:06.820]  it doesn't address other authorities that are on the books
[01:57:06.820 --> 01:57:11.820]  that NSA has, such as Executive Order 12333,
[01:57:12.140 --> 01:57:15.340]  Presidential Order, that gives the NSA the authority
[01:57:15.340 --> 01:57:19.340]  to collect anything it wants in an emergency situation.
[01:57:19.340 --> 01:57:21.420]  Now, who declares emergency?
[01:57:21.420 --> 01:57:22.340]  Well, Bush did.
[01:57:22.340 --> 01:57:24.020]  He said, we're at war effectively.
[01:57:24.020 --> 01:57:25.380]  I need more time authority.
[01:57:25.380 --> 01:57:27.380]  Every year Congress declares an emergency.
[01:57:27.380 --> 01:57:29.460]  That's how they suspend the Constitution.
[01:57:29.460 --> 01:57:30.660]  Exactly.
[01:57:30.660 --> 01:57:32.620]  And we've been operating that way
[01:57:32.620 --> 01:57:35.740]  all the way up to now since 2001.
[01:57:35.740 --> 01:57:39.300]  So how do we know what NSA is really doing?
[01:57:39.300 --> 01:57:41.740]  There's no mechanism for Congress to see
[01:57:41.740 --> 01:57:44.940]  into NSA's databases, to see what they're collecting,
[01:57:44.940 --> 01:57:47.220]  to see what analysts are doing with that.
[01:57:47.220 --> 01:57:49.780]  I'm not saying they're all playing around with our lives,
[01:57:49.780 --> 01:57:53.780]  but I'm telling you, the power to do so is there.
[01:57:53.780 --> 01:57:56.540]  How do we know Lois Lerner didn't get tip-offs
[01:57:56.540 --> 01:58:00.540]  about conservative groups seeking 401K status
[01:58:00.540 --> 01:58:05.540]  or 301C status, when she started going
[01:58:05.540 --> 01:58:08.380]  after them and making it hard for them?
[01:58:08.380 --> 01:58:09.420]  We don't know.
[01:58:09.420 --> 01:58:12.020]  We know the DEA uses NSA data.
[01:58:12.020 --> 01:58:13.380]  We know the FBI uses it.
[01:58:13.380 --> 01:58:15.340]  We know any unconstitutional power
[01:58:15.340 --> 01:58:17.300]  can and will be abused.
[01:58:17.300 --> 01:58:19.100]  Absolutely right.
[01:58:19.100 --> 01:58:22.180]  We're gonna come back with it in 70 seconds over this break.
[01:58:22.180 --> 01:58:23.700]  I'm gonna give you the four or five minutes
[01:58:23.700 --> 01:58:24.900]  to just hammer in on this,
[01:58:24.900 --> 01:58:28.260]  because that's just bombshell from your expert analysis
[01:58:28.260 --> 01:58:31.580]  that exactly there's all these other operating powers.
[01:58:31.580 --> 01:58:35.020]  They focus on some section of the Patriot Act with metadata
[01:58:35.020 --> 01:58:36.860]  when it's admitted they're just recording
[01:58:36.860 --> 01:58:38.020]  basically everything.
[01:58:38.020 --> 01:58:38.860]  Stay with us.
[01:58:38.860 --> 01:58:40.460]  We'll be back with NSA whistleblower,
[01:58:40.460 --> 01:58:42.460]  Herk Lebe, exposefacts.org.
[01:58:42.460 --> 01:59:05.460]  We're listening to GCN, visit GCNLive.com today.
[01:59:12.460 --> 01:59:14.140]  The first time in more than a year,

[01:59:17.540 --> 01:59:19.980]  X2 nascent iodine are running low.
[01:59:19.980 --> 01:59:22.860]  But what's even more serious is the supply
[01:59:22.860 --> 01:59:24.740]  of these deep earth crystals.
[01:59:24.740 --> 01:59:29.500]  That exclusive 999 pure source is proprietary

[01:59:32.100 --> 01:59:35.260]  And that supply is running low and is in question.
[01:59:35.260 --> 01:59:36.780]  That's why it's more important than ever
[01:59:36.780 --> 01:59:39.380]  to secure your current and long time supply

[02:00:10.940 --> 02:00:12.500]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.500 --> 02:00:14.060]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:14.060 --> 02:00:18.220]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[02:00:18.220 --> 02:00:23.820]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.820 --> 02:00:25.940]  Herk Lebe was getting into the USA Freedom Act
[02:00:25.940 --> 02:00:29.020]  that many analysts are saying, even singing in admits,
[02:00:29.020 --> 02:00:31.260]  is worse than the Patriot Act.
[02:00:31.260 --> 02:00:33.700]  He was breaking down all the other provisions
[02:00:33.700 --> 02:00:36.700]  that they're using to do basically unconstitutional spying
[02:00:36.700 --> 02:00:37.780]  that aren't being discussed.
[02:00:37.780 --> 02:00:41.060]  And then, in closing, I want to ask him,
[02:00:41.060 --> 02:00:43.500]  what about the corporations and what they're doing?
[02:00:43.500 --> 02:00:45.340]  Sir, go ahead.
[02:00:45.340 --> 02:00:48.740]  No, well, what's the difference between what
[02:00:48.740 --> 02:00:51.700]  Google is doing with our data and what NSA is doing?
[02:00:51.700 --> 02:00:55.740]  Now, Google, of course, is very fixated on Americans
[02:00:55.740 --> 02:01:00.220]  and any user of Google, for that matter, around the globe.
[02:01:00.220 --> 02:01:03.260]  And they claim, well, we're just looking at your habits.
[02:01:03.260 --> 02:01:07.580]  Well, you know, to me, that's profilability.
[02:01:07.580 --> 02:01:10.500]  Now, let's talk about profiles.
[02:01:10.500 --> 02:01:12.180]  They're a double-edged sword.
[02:01:12.180 --> 02:01:14.060]  There's a good side and a bad side.
[02:01:14.060 --> 02:01:17.580]  Good side is, if I understand your behavior
[02:01:17.580 --> 02:01:23.500]  in electronic data of all kinds, I can track you.
[02:01:23.500 --> 02:01:25.540]  I can find out who you're talking to,
[02:01:25.540 --> 02:01:29.340]  which means I can then infer something about your life,
[02:01:29.340 --> 02:01:31.660]  if you're calling a psychiatrist all the time,
[02:01:31.660 --> 02:01:36.900]  or alcoholics anonymous, or a young lady
[02:01:36.900 --> 02:01:38.740]  when you've been married for 20 years
[02:01:38.740 --> 02:01:41.100]  and she's not a relative.
[02:01:41.100 --> 02:01:44.740]  There's all kinds of things I can infer and then
[02:01:44.740 --> 02:01:46.500]  use to blackmail you.
[02:01:46.500 --> 02:01:52.980]  So any organization, NSA, Google, any organization,
[02:01:52.980 --> 02:01:57.620]  accrues power over all of us, whether they like it or not,
[02:01:57.620 --> 02:02:02.980]  if they make us the subject of studying our behavior in data.
[02:02:02.980 --> 02:02:05.140]  And not just content.
[02:02:05.140 --> 02:02:08.620]  I want people to understand that if I just
[02:02:08.620 --> 02:02:13.180]  get your metadata day after day, 24 hours a day,
[02:02:13.180 --> 02:02:16.900]  everything you do, swiping your gas card at a gas station,
[02:02:16.900 --> 02:02:19.660]  buying flowers with a credit card,
[02:02:19.660 --> 02:02:22.700]  turning on your computer at work or at home,
[02:02:22.700 --> 02:02:25.260]  I can actually track those events
[02:02:25.260 --> 02:02:29.060]  and put together a set of activities on a clock
[02:02:29.060 --> 02:02:31.820]  and track you throughout the 24-hour day.
[02:02:31.820 --> 02:02:35.380]  And I'll know when you're not home, and I'll know those things.
[02:02:35.380 --> 02:02:39.540]  It's very, very dangerous when misused.
[02:02:39.540 --> 02:02:42.420]  And there's very few regulations regulating the way
[02:02:42.420 --> 02:02:44.820]  business uses this information.
[02:02:44.820 --> 02:02:48.540]  The next thing we'll see is NSA hiring out to Google
[02:02:48.540 --> 02:02:50.540]  just to give them their profile.
[02:02:50.540 --> 02:02:54.420]  I'm sure there's intelligence in that information.
[02:02:54.420 --> 02:02:56.900]  In fact, the word is that's already happening
[02:02:56.900 --> 02:02:58.820]  and Amazon's partnering with the CIA.
[02:02:58.820 --> 02:03:01.300]  And of course, I'm sure you've heard.
[02:03:01.300 --> 02:03:03.340]  They know if you make more money,
[02:03:03.340 --> 02:03:05.940]  they have algorithms when you buy plane tickets or purses
[02:03:05.940 --> 02:03:08.100]  or whatever to charge you more.
[02:03:08.100 --> 02:03:10.660]  We buy a lot of plane tickets here.
[02:03:10.660 --> 02:03:14.020]  So we run our machines that do it cookie-free and everything
[02:03:14.020 --> 02:03:18.100]  else because a plane ticket to Austria
[02:03:18.100 --> 02:03:22.340]  would be $15,000 in business instead of $3,000
[02:03:22.340 --> 02:03:23.620]  by clearing cookies.
[02:03:23.620 --> 02:03:26.620]  Now, no one's going to tell you that, are they?
[02:03:26.620 --> 02:03:28.940]  No, no one's going to tell you at all.
[02:03:28.940 --> 02:03:32.180]  They will manipulate your environment, though,
[02:03:32.180 --> 02:03:37.420]  to get the desired result, which is money.
[02:03:37.420 --> 02:03:38.660]  It's always money.
[02:03:38.660 --> 02:03:43.300]  I was at home buying plane tickets for folks
[02:03:43.300 --> 02:03:46.020]  here at the office, and it was outrageous prices.
[02:03:46.020 --> 02:03:49.660]  And I separately went down to a computer center, went in,
[02:03:49.660 --> 02:03:52.820]  used clean systems to go in, and it was like eight times
[02:03:52.820 --> 02:03:53.420]  cheaper.
[02:03:53.420 --> 02:03:56.940]  This is the criminal systems they're engaged in.
[02:03:56.940 --> 02:03:59.340]  We turn our world over to AI.
[02:03:59.340 --> 02:04:02.220]  It will gain human systems and consolidate wealth.
[02:04:02.220 --> 02:04:04.740]  It's the end of the free market.
[02:04:04.740 --> 02:04:05.700]  True.
[02:04:05.700 --> 02:04:08.620]  It will be total manipulation as many believe
[02:04:08.620 --> 02:04:10.940]  the stock market already is.
[02:04:10.940 --> 02:04:12.420]  And I don't doubt that.
[02:04:12.420 --> 02:04:17.020]  It's designed to perform on the behalf of the rich.
[02:04:17.020 --> 02:04:19.420]  Well, Kirk Webe, I've got to say that you're
[02:04:19.420 --> 02:04:21.980]  one of the most amazing whistleblowers I've ever talked to.
[02:04:21.980 --> 02:04:23.660]  I want to thank you for your courage.
[02:04:23.660 --> 02:04:25.580]  You didn't even, because you're a real man,
[02:04:25.580 --> 02:04:28.220]  didn't all the persecution you and others have gone through.
[02:04:28.220 --> 02:04:29.420]  But we salute you.
[02:04:29.420 --> 02:04:31.740]  You're fighting for this republic more than you ever
[02:04:31.740 --> 02:04:34.660]  did when you were working in the military.
[02:04:34.660 --> 02:04:37.940]  ExposedFacts.org, please come back very soon
[02:04:37.940 --> 02:04:39.820]  to get into all the other angles of this.
[02:04:39.820 --> 02:04:41.300]  Thank you so much.
[02:04:41.300 --> 02:04:43.380]  And thank you, Alex, for having me.
[02:04:43.380 --> 02:04:46.660]  And let me urge your audience, stand up for truth.
[02:04:46.660 --> 02:04:50.780]  If you see wrongdoing, even at a local level, expose it.
[02:04:50.780 --> 02:04:55.380]  It all begins there, and we've all got to get this done.
[02:04:55.380 --> 02:04:56.620]  Or we're going to go down.
[02:04:56.620 --> 02:04:58.140]  God bless you, sir.
[02:04:58.140 --> 02:05:00.700]  Thank you so much, Kirk.
[02:05:00.700 --> 02:05:03.140]  A Rhode Island senator, Sheldon Whitehouse,
[02:05:03.140 --> 02:05:04.980]  just seriously suggested that people
[02:05:04.980 --> 02:05:08.180]  who are skeptical of global warming models and predictions
[02:05:08.180 --> 02:05:12.140]  should not only be censored, but prosecuted under the RICO Act.
[02:05:12.140 --> 02:05:15.940]  That's the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act
[02:05:15.940 --> 02:05:19.620]  of 1970, going after organized crime.
[02:05:19.620 --> 02:05:21.940]  The government was having trouble getting convictions
[02:05:21.940 --> 02:05:23.940]  for organized crime because the mob could always
[02:05:23.940 --> 02:05:25.300]  hire the best lawyers.
[02:05:25.300 --> 02:05:27.980]  So they decided they'd take away their money first
[02:05:27.980 --> 02:05:29.820]  so they could get a conviction.
[02:05:29.820 --> 02:05:32.700]  But when you take away constitutional rights for the mob,
[02:05:32.700 --> 02:05:35.180]  you take them away for everyone.
[02:05:35.180 --> 02:05:39.380]  Within 16 years, Reagan signed civil asset forfeiture laws
[02:05:39.380 --> 02:05:42.140]  that allowed the police to confiscate property even
[02:05:42.140 --> 02:05:43.980]  without charging you with a crime.
[02:05:43.980 --> 02:05:49.260]  By 1994, RICO was being used against pro-life activists.
[02:05:49.260 --> 02:05:52.340]  So it's not a stretch that this government would use RICO
[02:05:52.340 --> 02:05:55.500]  against people who are skeptical of its agenda.
[02:05:55.500 --> 02:05:58.260]  For more information, go to infowars.com.
[02:05:58.260 --> 02:05:59.900]  I'm David Knight.
[02:05:59.900 --> 02:06:03.380]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life,

[02:06:05.060 --> 02:06:08.420]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimentical grade,
[02:06:08.420 --> 02:06:11.220]  bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12,
[02:06:11.220 --> 02:06:14.140]  methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections,
[02:06:14.140 --> 02:06:15.940]  and adenosylcobalamin.
[02:06:15.940 --> 02:06:18.700]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue,
[02:06:18.700 --> 02:06:19.540]  and then swallowed.
[02:06:19.540 --> 02:06:21.460]  No needles, no injections.

[02:06:29.820 --> 02:06:30.900]  Alex Jones here.
[02:06:30.900 --> 02:06:32.300]  For the last two years, I've been
[02:06:32.300 --> 02:06:35.220]  working with top doctors, nutritionist, and chemist
[02:06:35.220 --> 02:06:37.860]  to design a nutraceutical formulation that
[02:06:37.860 --> 02:06:40.100]  has truly life-changing health benefits.

[02:06:59.700 --> 02:07:00.980]  Alex Jones here.
[02:07:00.980 --> 02:07:04.780]  For the infowarslife.com consumer alert report,
[02:07:04.780 --> 02:07:07.820]  many of you are aware that around the world,
[02:07:07.820 --> 02:07:10.340]  most populations are woefully deficient
[02:07:10.340 --> 02:07:12.180]  in clean forms of iodine.
[02:07:12.180 --> 02:07:15.740]  The good news is, our listeners over the past two years
[02:07:15.740 --> 02:07:20.340]  tried X2 nascent iodine and experienced it for themselves.
[02:07:20.340 --> 02:07:23.500]  The bad news is, for the first time in more than a year,
[02:07:23.500 --> 02:07:26.900]  supplies at infowarslife.com of survival shield
[02:07:26.900 --> 02:07:29.340]  X2 nascent iodine are running low.
[02:07:29.340 --> 02:07:32.220]  But what's even more serious is the supply
[02:07:32.220 --> 02:07:34.100]  of these deep earth crystals.
[02:07:34.100 --> 02:07:39.420]  That exclusive 999 pure source is proprietary and only

[02:07:41.460 --> 02:07:44.620]  And that supply is running low and is in question.
[02:07:44.620 --> 02:07:46.180]  That's why it's more important than ever
[02:07:46.180 --> 02:07:49.380]  to secure your current and longtime supply of survival
[02:07:49.380 --> 02:07:51.580]  shield nascent iodine X2 today.

[02:08:00.540 --> 02:08:01.420]  Paul, guess what?
[02:08:01.420 --> 02:08:01.900]  What?
[02:08:01.900 --> 02:08:04.420]  We bugged Mr. Blake's cell and we heard him talking to his lawyer.
[02:08:04.420 --> 02:08:06.980]  You see, we took the mic and we hit him in the cell window.
[02:08:06.980 --> 02:08:07.900]  Wait a minute.
[02:08:07.900 --> 02:08:09.060]  What are you talking about?
[02:08:09.060 --> 02:08:11.380]  We bugged Mr. Blake's cell.
[02:08:11.380 --> 02:08:12.340]  You what?
[02:08:12.340 --> 02:08:14.420]  We bugged the cell with arms tape recorder.
[02:08:14.420 --> 02:08:15.420]  Just listen to this, Paul.
[02:08:15.420 --> 02:08:16.500]  I can't listen to that.
[02:08:16.500 --> 02:08:17.020]  But Paul.
[02:08:17.020 --> 02:08:18.460]  Opie, I can't listen to that.
[02:08:18.460 --> 02:08:19.860]  I'm not permitted.
[02:08:19.860 --> 02:08:21.500]  But Paul, you don't understand.
[02:08:21.500 --> 02:08:24.220]  Opie, I can't listen to this.
[02:08:24.220 --> 02:08:26.420]  Now, I told you about eavesdropping.
[02:08:26.420 --> 02:08:27.860]  But Paul, this is different.
[02:08:27.860 --> 02:08:29.580]  Yes, it's worse.
[02:08:29.580 --> 02:08:32.900]  You overheard a conversation that was supposed to be private.
[02:08:32.900 --> 02:08:35.100]  Now, I can't be a party to that.
[02:08:35.100 --> 02:08:36.500]  But Paul, if you just listen to this.
[02:08:36.500 --> 02:08:38.540]  Opie, I can't listen.
[02:08:38.540 --> 02:08:39.820]  Paul, you're erasing a tape.
[02:08:39.820 --> 02:08:43.020]  That's what I mean to do.
[02:08:43.020 --> 02:08:47.220]  You bugged the conversation between a lawyer and his client.
[02:08:47.220 --> 02:08:51.500]  Now, that's violating one of the most sacred rights of privacy.
[02:08:51.500 --> 02:08:52.340]  But Paul.
[02:08:52.340 --> 02:08:53.700]  No buts.
[02:08:53.700 --> 02:08:55.540]  But if it helps the law.
[02:08:55.540 --> 02:09:02.020]  Opie, the law can't use this kind of help.
[02:09:02.020 --> 02:09:02.660]  There you go.
[02:09:02.660 --> 02:09:05.420]  And that's the type of stuff that was on TV in the 50s and 60s.
[02:09:05.420 --> 02:09:07.460]  And now look where we are.
[02:09:07.460 --> 02:09:09.620]  We knew every totalitarian system that
[02:09:09.620 --> 02:09:12.420]  killed hundreds of millions of people in the last century
[02:09:12.420 --> 02:09:16.380]  pushed this type of garbage.
[02:09:16.380 --> 02:09:18.140]  I mean, you want to live in hell on Earth, folks?
[02:09:18.140 --> 02:09:20.620]  You get rid of privacy because bad people
[02:09:20.620 --> 02:09:25.260]  will use it to screw you over every time.
[02:09:25.260 --> 02:09:27.060]  It's the Ring of Mordor.
[02:09:27.060 --> 02:09:28.620]  It cannot be used for good.
[02:09:28.620 --> 02:09:33.580]  It will always turn bad 10, 20 times what you use it for good.
[02:09:33.580 --> 02:09:35.260]  And it's evil if you study history.
[02:09:35.260 --> 02:09:37.020]  It'll work right up front.
[02:09:37.020 --> 02:09:38.180]  And you'll think it's great.
[02:09:38.180 --> 02:09:39.460]  And you'll start using it more.
[02:09:39.460 --> 02:09:41.580]  And then it's over.
[02:09:41.580 --> 02:09:43.340]  And by the way, I just mentioned this earlier.
[02:09:43.340 --> 02:09:45.340]  And they found some news articles and put them
[02:09:45.340 --> 02:09:48.340]  on screen for TV viewers, for radio listeners.
[02:09:48.340 --> 02:09:49.860]  I'm going to read these headlines for you
[02:09:49.860 --> 02:09:51.780]  so you can go see it for yourself.
[02:09:51.780 --> 02:09:54.180]  I learned about this more than 10 years ago
[02:09:54.180 --> 02:09:58.460]  from an industry insider we had on the show.
[02:09:58.460 --> 02:10:00.860]  And then now it's been in the news the last few years.
[02:10:00.860 --> 02:10:03.100]  But you know Amazon can predict what you're
[02:10:03.100 --> 02:10:06.460]  going to buy off your habits before you buy it
[02:10:06.460 --> 02:10:09.540]  and before you even know you're going to buy it.
[02:10:09.540 --> 02:10:11.300]  Now, that's beyond NSA.
[02:10:11.300 --> 02:10:13.020]  And that's why they're partnering with Amazon
[02:10:13.020 --> 02:10:15.020]  at the NSA and CIA.
[02:10:15.020 --> 02:10:15.940]  Here's the headline.
[02:10:15.940 --> 02:10:20.340]  Websites vary prices deals based on users' information.
[02:10:20.340 --> 02:10:22.340]  Of the London Evening Standard, online shoppers
[02:10:22.340 --> 02:10:24.860]  pay more if spy software shows they're well off.
[02:10:27.500 --> 02:10:32.220]  As an online retailer, folks, I could partner with companies
[02:10:32.220 --> 02:10:35.020]  and pay them a percentage of profit and do this to people
[02:10:35.020 --> 02:10:37.620]  with algorithms that know what you'll pay
[02:10:37.620 --> 02:10:40.020]  so when you come there, the numbers change.
[02:10:40.020 --> 02:10:41.460]  We've talked to industry folks.
[02:10:41.460 --> 02:10:45.140]  We'd probably increase profits 80-something
[02:10:45.140 --> 02:10:47.620]  percent the first year.
[02:10:47.620 --> 02:10:48.620]  I'm at a disadvantage.
[02:10:48.620 --> 02:10:51.700]  I will not commit what I know as a crime, even
[02:10:51.700 --> 02:10:53.500]  if the government says it's OK against people.
[02:10:53.500 --> 02:10:55.620]  Even though it would fund our operation,
[02:10:55.620 --> 02:10:57.620]  I could put the ring of Mordor on right now
[02:10:57.620 --> 02:10:59.140]  and be more powerful.
[02:10:59.140 --> 02:11:01.260]  But it would turn bad down the road.
[02:11:01.260 --> 02:11:05.500]  I just, but now we're just so inundated by it.
[02:11:05.500 --> 02:11:07.220]  It soon will be obsolete when I'm
[02:11:07.220 --> 02:11:10.660]  able to operate because soon the whole system's based on this.
[02:11:10.660 --> 02:11:14.540]  I'll have to go out and be amish to not be part of it.
[02:11:14.540 --> 02:11:17.900]  It takes you voting with your dollars and saying no.
[02:11:17.900 --> 02:11:20.260]  And I'm going to explain something at home and at our office.
[02:11:20.260 --> 02:11:22.100]  And I try to remind the guys to do this one that we need
[02:11:22.100 --> 02:11:24.860]  to use TravelAge because my crew is too busy to be doing it.
[02:11:24.860 --> 02:11:27.380]  I'm sending three people to Switzerland,
[02:11:27.380 --> 02:11:29.580]  on the edge of Switzerland, to the last time
[02:11:29.580 --> 02:11:33.980]  was in Switzerland and Europe, England before that.
[02:11:33.980 --> 02:11:37.100]  I'm sending three crew members to Austria
[02:11:37.100 --> 02:11:41.060]  and the difference in plane tickets,
[02:11:41.060 --> 02:11:42.780]  if you clear your cookies, because they
[02:11:42.780 --> 02:11:44.260]  know we buy a lot of plane tickets.
[02:11:44.260 --> 02:11:46.060]  And in the past, we just didn't understand this
[02:11:46.060 --> 02:11:47.180]  or I didn't tell people.
[02:11:47.180 --> 02:11:51.140]  We'd pay whatever it was saying and wouldn't shop too much.
[02:11:51.140 --> 02:11:53.700]  And it's algorithms across platforms.
[02:11:53.700 --> 02:11:55.020]  You can be on British Airways.
[02:11:55.020 --> 02:11:57.780]  You can go to another site and put it in there.
[02:11:57.780 --> 02:11:59.100]  It knows who you are.
[02:11:59.100 --> 02:12:00.260]  It applies it.
[02:12:00.260 --> 02:12:01.140]  And it's the same price.
[02:12:01.140 --> 02:12:02.860]  You go clear your cookies.
[02:12:02.860 --> 02:12:05.340]  You go protect your identity.
[02:12:05.340 --> 02:12:10.180]  It's five, 10, sometimes 15 times cheaper.
[02:12:10.180 --> 02:12:12.140]  Do you understand the magnitude?
[02:12:12.140 --> 02:12:14.980]  People say, I don't care if they're spying on me.
[02:12:14.980 --> 02:12:16.500]  I have nothing to hide.
[02:12:16.500 --> 02:12:17.180]  That's what you're saying.
[02:12:17.180 --> 02:12:18.260]  I don't lock my doors.
[02:12:18.260 --> 02:12:18.980]  I have nothing to hide.
[02:12:18.980 --> 02:12:20.100]  I don't pull my shades down.
[02:12:20.100 --> 02:12:20.780]  I have nothing to hide.
[02:12:20.780 --> 02:12:22.060]  I don't have a gate around my house.
[02:12:22.060 --> 02:12:23.300]  I have nothing to hide.
[02:12:23.300 --> 02:12:24.780]  I don't put a fence around my cows.
[02:12:24.780 --> 02:12:25.660]  I have nothing to hide.
[02:12:25.660 --> 02:12:29.140]  They're going to walk off and fall in dishes and get run over.
[02:12:29.140 --> 02:12:33.820]  We have barriers to protect ourselves.
[02:12:33.820 --> 02:12:36.820]  You spy on the government, you get espionage charges.
[02:12:36.820 --> 02:12:39.020]  They spy on us, it's no big deal.
[02:12:39.020 --> 02:12:42.060]  Corporations, you spy on them, you get arrested.
[02:12:42.060 --> 02:12:44.100]  They spy on you, it's no big deal.
[02:12:44.100 --> 02:12:47.740]  And it's because if we could almost double our profits
[02:12:47.740 --> 02:12:50.900]  screwing you like this, can you imagine?
[02:12:50.900 --> 02:12:53.620]  Everybody else just says yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[02:12:53.620 --> 02:12:56.740]  You can go out right now and partner with companies
[02:12:56.740 --> 02:12:59.780]  with your shopping carts to screw people.
[02:12:59.780 --> 02:13:03.100]  And most people just do it.
[02:13:03.100 --> 02:13:04.380]  In fact, I have people tell me I'm
[02:13:04.380 --> 02:13:07.420]  a chump when I've talked to consultants and folks, top
[02:13:07.420 --> 02:13:09.340]  people, that I won't do this.
[02:13:09.340 --> 02:13:10.500]  They go, everybody's doing it.
[02:13:10.500 --> 02:13:14.740]  Well, everybody was cutting children's hearts out 600
[02:13:14.740 --> 02:13:18.140]  years ago in Mexico City and eating children.
[02:13:18.140 --> 02:13:19.300]  They were doing it in Europe, too.
[02:13:19.300 --> 02:13:20.860]  I'm not doing it.
[02:13:20.860 --> 02:13:23.540]  Sure, everybody in Sodom and Gomorrah was raping kids.
[02:13:23.540 --> 02:13:24.580]  I ain't doing it.
[02:13:24.580 --> 02:13:25.260]  You got it?
[02:13:25.260 --> 02:13:27.100]  I'm not taking a microchip.
[02:13:27.100 --> 02:13:28.780]  I'm not taking your vaccines.
[02:13:28.780 --> 02:13:30.260]  I'm not eating your GMO.
[02:13:30.260 --> 02:13:31.940]  And I'm not drinking your fluoride.
[02:13:31.940 --> 02:13:33.180]  You got it?
[02:13:33.180 --> 02:13:34.700]  I know it's a takeover.
[02:13:34.700 --> 02:13:35.940]  I know it's evil.
[02:13:35.940 --> 02:13:37.100]  I know it's bad.
[02:13:37.100 --> 02:13:38.860]  And yes, I'm frustrated.
[02:13:38.860 --> 02:13:40.620]  We could use those millions of dollars
[02:13:40.620 --> 02:13:41.940]  to fund the operation.
[02:13:41.940 --> 02:13:46.500]  But I cannot engage in criminal activity.
[02:13:46.500 --> 02:13:48.980]  And I sit here and watch all these immoral people
[02:13:48.980 --> 02:13:51.540]  taking over as they screw everybody.
[02:13:51.540 --> 02:13:55.140]  And they do it because the public's lazy and takes it.
[02:13:55.140 --> 02:13:58.700]  Don't you people want to get plane tickets for five, six,
[02:13:58.700 --> 02:14:02.100]  seven, eight, nine, 10, 12 times cheaper?
[02:14:02.100 --> 02:14:04.020]  Don't you want train tickets cheaper?
[02:14:04.020 --> 02:14:05.980]  Don't you want video games cheaper?
[02:14:05.980 --> 02:14:06.700]  Don't you want?
[02:14:06.700 --> 02:14:09.980]  No, you won't even do it to save money.
[02:14:09.980 --> 02:14:12.780]  You love getting screwed.
[02:14:12.780 --> 02:14:15.460]  Because you kill your own babies, and so you
[02:14:15.460 --> 02:14:16.340]  want to kill yourself.
[02:14:16.340 --> 02:14:17.900]  Your brain's powerful.
[02:14:17.900 --> 02:14:20.020]  You decide to be lazy and dumb and kill your babies.
[02:14:20.020 --> 02:14:21.700]  Your brain wants you dead.
[02:14:21.700 --> 02:14:24.220]  Your subconscious goes, this is a piece of crap.
[02:14:24.220 --> 02:14:26.140]  I want to die.
[02:14:26.140 --> 02:14:27.300]  So you're a loser.
[02:14:27.300 --> 02:14:30.140]  Did you get in to being losers?
[02:14:30.140 --> 02:14:31.140]  Excuse me.
[02:14:31.140 --> 02:14:34.660]  See, I try not to get mad because it exhausts me.
[02:14:34.660 --> 02:14:39.180]  It makes me so angry.
[02:14:39.180 --> 02:14:41.860]  It makes me so angry that I've got
[02:14:41.860 --> 02:14:43.900]  to spend so much time trying to raise money to fund
[02:14:43.900 --> 02:14:45.780]  this operation when I should be spending on fighting
[02:14:45.780 --> 02:14:46.700]  the globalist.
[02:14:46.700 --> 02:14:50.220]  And then I watch all these people, these soulless,
[02:14:50.220 --> 02:14:53.620]  moralist people screwing everyone.
[02:14:53.620 --> 02:14:56.260]  I mean, there used to be laws about manipulating prices
[02:14:56.260 --> 02:14:58.500]  at stores and putting up signs and changing them.
[02:14:58.500 --> 02:15:00.820]  And it's called false advertising.
[02:15:00.820 --> 02:15:02.620]  And this is still illegal what they're doing.
[02:15:02.620 --> 02:15:04.260]  Just no one's standing up to them.
[02:15:04.260 --> 02:15:06.380]  You want to know why they hate me and attack me all over
[02:15:06.380 --> 02:15:07.260]  the news every day?
[02:15:07.260 --> 02:15:10.780]  Because I know what they're doing, people.
[02:15:10.780 --> 02:15:13.420]  And it ain't hard.
[02:15:13.420 --> 02:15:16.220]  I read the news, and I run a major operation.
[02:15:16.220 --> 02:15:19.220]  I live it.
[02:15:19.220 --> 02:15:22.220]  You know, I could go join these people right now.
[02:15:22.220 --> 02:15:24.380]  The establishment's reaching out to me right now
[02:15:24.380 --> 02:15:25.060]  to go join them.
[02:15:25.060 --> 02:15:27.940]  And let me tell this episode something, never over my dead
[02:15:27.940 --> 02:15:29.780]  body, and I know that's what it comes down to.
[02:15:29.780 --> 02:15:32.700]  I will never join with the devil.
[02:15:32.700 --> 02:15:35.540]  I will never be part of hurting innocents.
[02:15:35.540 --> 02:15:39.700]  I will never be part of being a bully and screwing people over.
[02:15:39.700 --> 02:15:41.700]  I want to empower this species.
[02:15:41.700 --> 02:15:42.980]  That's the big payoff.
[02:15:42.980 --> 02:15:47.300]  I want my progeny with your progeny going into the future
[02:15:47.300 --> 02:15:55.340]  as an incredible species, not a bunch of bat-stabbing crap.
[02:15:55.340 --> 02:15:57.140]  Excuse me.
[02:15:57.140 --> 02:15:58.540]  I want to air this Fukushima update.
[02:15:58.540 --> 02:16:00.620]  And yes, it's also about finding our operation.
[02:16:00.620 --> 02:16:01.780]  It's a win-win.
[02:16:01.780 --> 02:16:04.380]  I'm going to skip the network break because I've gone too long here.
[02:16:04.380 --> 02:16:05.060]  I'm going to settle down.
[02:16:05.060 --> 02:16:06.300]  I wasn't going to air this probably today,
[02:16:06.300 --> 02:16:07.340]  but I need to take a break.
[02:16:07.340 --> 02:16:09.060]  It's about an eight-minute video.
[02:16:09.060 --> 02:16:11.060]  We're going to air this, and I'm going to try to settle down.
[02:16:11.060 --> 02:16:14.100]  We'll walk around, get some water to drink,
[02:16:14.100 --> 02:16:15.900]  and then we're going to come back and just get
[02:16:15.900 --> 02:16:17.100]  into all the rest of the news.
[02:16:17.100 --> 02:16:19.140]  I mean, do you understand?
[02:16:19.140 --> 02:16:21.500]  It's not just if you're, quote, I saw idiots in the comments,
[02:16:21.500 --> 02:16:23.700]  these articles going, good, screw the rich people.
[02:16:23.700 --> 02:16:26.060]  Oh, yeah.
[02:16:26.060 --> 02:16:28.540]  They know if you're blue collar what you'll pay.
[02:16:28.540 --> 02:16:30.540]  They know of your middle class how to cheat you.
[02:16:30.540 --> 02:16:31.660]  It might just be a dollar.
[02:16:31.660 --> 02:16:32.780]  It might be $10.
[02:16:32.780 --> 02:16:35.380]  It's AI screwing you.
[02:16:35.380 --> 02:16:37.340]  Just like criminals use your Facebook when you say,
[02:16:37.340 --> 02:16:38.980]  I'm going out of town for a week.
[02:16:38.980 --> 02:16:42.300]  Here's my new Christmas gift, this 80-inch TV,
[02:16:42.300 --> 02:16:44.620]  and they come rob you.
[02:16:44.620 --> 02:16:46.460]  It's not that you have nothing to hide.
[02:16:46.460 --> 02:16:51.500]  It's that people will use your information to screw you over.
[02:16:54.980 --> 02:16:56.460]  Let's go ahead and go to this special report,
[02:16:56.460 --> 02:16:57.300]  and I'll be back.
[02:16:57.300 --> 02:16:59.220]  Stay with us.
[02:16:59.220 --> 02:17:03.740]  Alex Jones here with a very important Fukushima update.
[02:17:03.740 --> 02:17:06.860]  Well, almost five years has passed since the tragic events
[02:17:06.860 --> 02:17:11.220]  that took place in 2011 north of Tokyo, Japan,
[02:17:11.220 --> 02:17:13.780]  in a province known as Fukushima.
[02:17:13.780 --> 02:17:17.060]  Of the six reactors damaged by the tsunami
[02:17:17.060 --> 02:17:20.220]  and the subsequent earthquake, five partially
[02:17:20.220 --> 02:17:21.700]  or totally exploded.
[02:17:21.700 --> 02:17:24.020]  And one of the key reactors that was actually
[02:17:24.020 --> 02:17:27.900]  a plutonium reactor, even more dangerous than the traditional
[02:17:27.900 --> 02:17:31.860]  uranium reactor, the MOX core system
[02:17:31.860 --> 02:17:37.420]  completely exploded with a giant hydrogen chain reaction.
[02:17:37.420 --> 02:17:39.500]  We had scientists on at the time who
[02:17:39.500 --> 02:17:42.220]  were able to study the isotopes and confirmed
[02:17:42.220 --> 02:17:47.060]  that indeed a fission chain reaction had taken place.
[02:17:47.060 --> 02:17:49.780]  Now, quite frankly, there is no silver bullet
[02:17:49.780 --> 02:17:52.940]  to protect yourself from radiation.
[02:17:52.940 --> 02:17:55.740]  The northern hemisphere of our planet
[02:17:55.740 --> 02:17:58.500]  has doubled to triple depending on what time of year
[02:17:58.500 --> 02:18:01.900]  we're looking at of the southern hemisphere, simply
[02:18:01.900 --> 02:18:06.580]  because most nuclear disasters from Chernobyl to Fukushima
[02:18:06.580 --> 02:18:09.020]  and nuclear testing have taken place
[02:18:09.020 --> 02:18:10.460]  in the northern hemisphere.
[02:18:10.460 --> 02:18:13.220]  This is quite frankly insane.
[02:18:13.220 --> 02:18:16.380]  But it was four, four and a half years ago
[02:18:16.380 --> 02:18:20.660]  that I began to really research radiation poisoning
[02:18:20.660 --> 02:18:22.860]  and things that were happening around the world
[02:18:22.860 --> 02:18:26.260]  so that I could try to mitigate what was happening to myself
[02:18:26.260 --> 02:18:27.380]  and my family.
[02:18:27.380 --> 02:18:30.820]  Because we had the reports from Connecticut on the east coast
[02:18:30.820 --> 02:18:33.700]  and places in California and other areas
[02:18:33.700 --> 02:18:38.340]  of increased radioactive isotopes in cow's milk
[02:18:38.340 --> 02:18:41.180]  because they were eating on the surface of the grass
[02:18:41.180 --> 02:18:42.780]  where it was bioaccumulating.
[02:18:42.780 --> 02:18:47.060]  It was showing up in higher levels in tuna off California.
[02:18:47.060 --> 02:18:49.580]  And the media was saying it was no big deal.
[02:18:49.580 --> 02:18:53.220]  Now higher levels of radiation is supposedly OK for you.
[02:18:53.220 --> 02:18:56.300]  Well, now the International Business Times, RT,
[02:18:56.300 --> 02:18:58.340]  and others are reporting that there
[02:18:58.340 --> 02:19:04.020]  are over 200 plus containers at the wreck facility
[02:19:04.020 --> 02:19:06.180]  where five of the reactors were damaged.
[02:19:06.180 --> 02:19:07.860]  Several totally exploded.
[02:19:07.860 --> 02:19:09.980]  That are filled with spent fuel rods
[02:19:09.980 --> 02:19:13.100]  and that are building up hydrogen again
[02:19:13.100 --> 02:19:15.420]  that could cause massive explosions.
[02:19:15.420 --> 02:19:18.340]  Each one of them could end up being bigger
[02:19:18.340 --> 02:19:21.820]  than what we saw back in 2011.
[02:19:21.820 --> 02:19:23.540]  This is simply insane.
[02:19:23.540 --> 02:19:26.180]  The entire facility on the edge of the ocean,
[02:19:26.180 --> 02:19:29.100]  because of the water they're dumping on it to keep it cool down,
[02:19:29.100 --> 02:19:32.020]  the radioactive rods that are heating up,
[02:19:32.020 --> 02:19:35.740]  is causing the whole facility to sink into the ground.
[02:19:35.740 --> 02:19:38.020]  Bottom line, Fukushima is only going to get worse.
[02:19:38.020 --> 02:19:40.380]  So I began to do research.
[02:19:40.380 --> 02:19:43.180]  And as I said back in a clip a few years ago,
[02:19:43.180 --> 02:19:47.220]  short of moving to the southern hemisphere,
[02:19:47.220 --> 02:19:51.980]  there's really nothing you can do other than protecting
[02:19:51.980 --> 02:19:55.340]  the tissues and the cells that we already have in our bodies.
[02:19:55.340 --> 02:19:57.700]  And nothing is a silver bullet.
[02:19:57.700 --> 02:20:00.860]  But the best thing you can do overall,
[02:20:00.860 --> 02:20:04.260]  that from my research gives the thyroid and other glands
[02:20:04.260 --> 02:20:07.140]  some modicum of a defense,
[02:20:07.140 --> 02:20:10.140]  is things like high quality nascent iodine.
[02:20:10.140 --> 02:20:13.260]  And a few years ago we launched our original survival shield
[02:20:13.260 --> 02:20:16.420]  from the cleanest sources that could be found
[02:20:16.420 --> 02:20:19.900]  from the ocean, from kelp and seaweed.
[02:20:19.900 --> 02:20:22.460]  But in our process of getting deeply into iodine
[02:20:22.460 --> 02:20:25.260]  and with our audience having such a great response
[02:20:25.260 --> 02:20:26.620]  and the great reviews,
[02:20:26.620 --> 02:20:28.100]  we began to do even more research
[02:20:28.100 --> 02:20:30.860]  and found that we could get a deep earth source
[02:20:30.860 --> 02:20:32.140]  of the crystals.
[02:20:32.140 --> 02:20:34.140]  And by securing these crystals,
[02:20:34.140 --> 02:20:37.300]  we're getting people a 999 source
[02:20:37.300 --> 02:20:39.460]  that is a whole other level.
[02:20:39.460 --> 02:20:41.420]  Other brands of so-called nascent iodine
[02:20:41.420 --> 02:20:43.260]  turned black or red on paper.
[02:20:43.260 --> 02:20:46.740]  Real iodine is electric blue-purple.
[02:20:46.740 --> 02:20:50.300]  And when you heat up our iodine on a hot plate,
[02:20:50.300 --> 02:20:53.380]  when it's in the crystal form, it turns into gas.
[02:20:53.380 --> 02:20:55.220]  That's how pure it is.
[02:20:55.220 --> 02:20:57.180]  And again, it's the good iodine.
[02:20:57.180 --> 02:21:01.100]  It's the good halogen that if your body didn't have it,
[02:21:01.100 --> 02:21:02.700]  you would die.
[02:21:02.700 --> 02:21:05.380]  Deficiencies long-term in iodine
[02:21:05.380 --> 02:21:08.780]  or the lack of iodine will kill you.
[02:21:08.780 --> 02:21:10.540]  That tells you how important this is.
[02:21:10.540 --> 02:21:14.260]  And in the 20s, in the Midwest, other areas,
[02:21:14.260 --> 02:21:17.060]  there was huge problems with big swollen thyroids
[02:21:17.060 --> 02:21:18.060]  and goiters.
[02:21:18.060 --> 02:21:20.980]  It was causing birth defects, serious crises.
[02:21:20.980 --> 02:21:23.540]  And the federal government did the right thing
[02:21:23.540 --> 02:21:27.420]  and said, we're going to work with salt manufacturers
[02:21:27.420 --> 02:21:32.260]  to add iodine, a lower grade sheep type,
[02:21:32.260 --> 02:21:33.540]  to the salt.
[02:21:33.540 --> 02:21:35.900]  And there's a bunch of different studies on this.
[02:21:35.900 --> 02:21:39.100]  But IQs in the Midwest and other areas
[02:21:39.100 --> 02:21:41.820]  that hadn't had enough iodine previously,
[02:21:41.820 --> 02:21:44.180]  because folks on the coast were getting enough from fish.
[02:21:44.180 --> 02:21:48.980]  But the folks in the Midwest saw upwards of a 15-point IQ
[02:21:48.980 --> 02:21:51.420]  increase in just 10 years.
[02:21:51.420 --> 02:21:55.540]  Iodine is something your body literally feeds off of.
[02:21:55.540 --> 02:21:59.300]  And it's connected into all your basic hormone functions
[02:21:59.300 --> 02:22:01.780]  so when you don't have enough iodine
[02:22:01.780 --> 02:22:03.380]  or don't have a pure form of iodine
[02:22:03.380 --> 02:22:05.020]  that your body can actually absorb,
[02:22:05.020 --> 02:22:06.780]  your body begins to break down.
[02:22:06.780 --> 02:22:08.820]  Now, when the government began to tell salt makers,
[02:22:08.820 --> 02:22:10.540]  don't put it in the salt anymore.
[02:22:10.540 --> 02:22:14.180]  By the 70s, they started pushing water fluoridation
[02:22:14.180 --> 02:22:16.420]  that is the bad halogen.
[02:22:16.420 --> 02:22:20.220]  Hydrofluorosalic acid, bromine, chlorine,
[02:22:20.220 --> 02:22:22.620]  these are the bad halogens that go in
[02:22:22.620 --> 02:22:26.340]  and basically fill up the thyroid and other glands.
[02:22:26.340 --> 02:22:29.140]  Simply put, iodine has changed my life.
[02:22:29.140 --> 02:22:33.020]  Pure high-quality nascent iodine, true nascent iodine
[02:22:33.020 --> 02:22:36.620]  from the deep earth source is even more life changing
[02:22:36.620 --> 02:22:39.820]  than what I experienced with original survival shield.
[02:22:39.820 --> 02:22:43.980]  I wanna challenge you to try survival shield X2 today.
[02:22:43.980 --> 02:22:47.020]  And one more important news update here,
[02:22:47.020 --> 02:22:48.460]  not just on Fukushima,
[02:22:48.460 --> 02:22:51.620]  but on our supply of survival shield X2.
[02:22:51.620 --> 02:22:55.420]  Securing enough high-quality iodine
[02:22:55.420 --> 02:22:59.620]  that would pass rigorous California standards and other tests
[02:22:59.620 --> 02:23:01.460]  was extremely hard to do.
[02:23:01.460 --> 02:23:04.140]  And in our search to have the very best
[02:23:04.140 --> 02:23:06.580]  we discovered what no one else was even using
[02:23:06.580 --> 02:23:09.900]  are aware of, that you're able to get iodine
[02:23:09.900 --> 02:23:12.980]  that's drilled in mind right here in the United States
[02:23:12.980 --> 02:23:16.220]  that is of a superior potency and quality.
[02:23:16.220 --> 02:23:19.420]  The true pure iodine crystals,
[02:23:19.420 --> 02:23:22.580]  the types that turn into gas when they're heated up.
[02:23:22.580 --> 02:23:25.780]  And when I began to take this in the six months
[02:23:25.780 --> 02:23:26.980]  before we rolled it out,
[02:23:26.980 --> 02:23:30.580]  literally testing it on myself, it was amazing.
[02:23:30.580 --> 02:23:33.740]  What came out of my skin, the weight I lost,
[02:23:33.740 --> 02:23:35.140]  the energy I got.
[02:23:35.140 --> 02:23:37.780]  But I wanna warn people, consult your physician
[02:23:37.780 --> 02:23:39.420]  before you try this.
[02:23:39.420 --> 02:23:43.220]  It's totally legal and lawful, it's incredibly clean,
[02:23:43.220 --> 02:23:45.220]  but at the same time, when you've been deficient
[02:23:45.220 --> 02:23:47.300]  in something like this for a long time,
[02:23:47.300 --> 02:23:50.380]  there will be, from my experience and others' experiences,
[02:23:50.380 --> 02:23:51.980]  major effects.
[02:23:51.980 --> 02:23:55.220]  And when it starts pulling out the bad halogens
[02:23:55.220 --> 02:23:57.260]  out of glands and tissues and things,
[02:23:58.660 --> 02:24:02.700]  you will feel like you're detoxing two weeks to a month in.
[02:24:02.700 --> 02:24:05.540]  Almost everyone I've talked to, this has happened.
[02:24:05.540 --> 02:24:08.180]  Dr. Group have helped develop this system,
[02:24:08.180 --> 02:24:10.780]  warned me up front, and it did happen.
[02:24:10.780 --> 02:24:13.020]  So this is serious, it's not a game.
[02:24:13.020 --> 02:24:17.220]  Check it out for yourself today at infowarslife.com.
[02:24:17.220 --> 02:24:18.620]  Or if you have any questions or comments
[02:24:18.620 --> 02:24:19.900]  or would like to order over the phone,
[02:24:19.900 --> 02:24:22.860]  888-253-3139.
[02:24:22.860 --> 02:24:25.380]  I believe in win, win, win.
[02:24:25.380 --> 02:24:28.140]  It's high quality, it's the purest form out there,
[02:24:28.140 --> 02:24:30.700]  it's very affordable, it's something the globalists
[02:24:30.700 --> 02:24:33.580]  are aware of, that's why they push bad halogens
[02:24:33.580 --> 02:24:35.020]  and not the good halogen.
[02:24:36.060 --> 02:24:38.860]  It's a supply that is finite.
[02:24:38.860 --> 02:24:42.140]  We're having trouble right now as I was about to get to
[02:24:42.140 --> 02:24:45.620]  running out of it and being able to get a new supply
[02:24:45.620 --> 02:24:46.940]  of the pure crystals.
[02:24:46.940 --> 02:24:49.140]  So bottom line, it's time to stock up.
[02:24:49.140 --> 02:24:52.820]  And finally, your purchase of these products,
[02:24:52.820 --> 02:24:55.220]  funds, infowars.com, the nightly news,
[02:24:55.220 --> 02:24:57.820]  the syndicated radio show, the print media,
[02:24:57.820 --> 02:24:59.460]  everything we're doing.
[02:24:59.460 --> 02:25:01.180]  So it is a 360 win.
[02:25:01.180 --> 02:25:05.420]  It's important to stockpile this and to have a reserve supply
[02:25:05.420 --> 02:25:07.660]  because you look at the attacks on infowars,
[02:25:07.660 --> 02:25:09.620]  the attacks on alternative media,
[02:25:09.620 --> 02:25:11.540]  you look at the attacks on supplements,
[02:25:11.540 --> 02:25:14.780]  and then just the supply chain that has broken down for us
[02:25:14.780 --> 02:25:16.940]  basically right now, I wanted to give you a heads up
[02:25:16.940 --> 02:25:20.020]  to secure your survival shield X2 today.
[02:25:20.020 --> 02:25:22.180]  Well, that's it for this important news,
[02:25:22.180 --> 02:25:24.140]  consumer update alert.
[02:25:24.140 --> 02:25:26.100]  Again, thank you all for your support,
[02:25:26.100 --> 02:25:29.140]  not just of infowars.com,
[02:25:29.140 --> 02:25:31.340]  but the First Amendment across the board.
[02:25:31.340 --> 02:25:33.740]  Never forget, if you're watching this transmission,
[02:25:33.740 --> 02:25:35.540]  you are the resistance.
[02:25:35.540 --> 02:25:40.540]  And again, that is an important update on Fukushima.
[02:25:44.540 --> 02:25:46.660]  The first half and the second half is a plug for iodine
[02:25:46.660 --> 02:25:47.980]  because I totally believe what I'm saying
[02:25:47.980 --> 02:25:50.860]  and the evidence is there, infowarslife.com.
[02:25:50.860 --> 02:25:51.940]  And I'm done plugging for the day,
[02:25:51.940 --> 02:25:54.700]  that's just how we, one of the ways we fund our operation.
[02:25:54.700 --> 02:25:55.620]  And I was sitting there thinking,
[02:25:55.620 --> 02:25:57.980]  we may not be able to get this in the future.
[02:25:57.980 --> 02:25:59.140]  I better get a bunch for myself
[02:25:59.140 --> 02:26:00.740]  and I was driving home with a whole case of it
[02:26:00.740 --> 02:26:03.460]  and I went, wait a minute, that's a great sales pitch.
[02:26:03.460 --> 02:26:05.340]  The truth is always the best sales.
[02:26:05.340 --> 02:26:08.900]  So I came and just shared my own concerns with you,
[02:26:08.900 --> 02:26:10.060]  but it's making it sell out.
[02:26:10.060 --> 02:26:11.180]  So it's kind of a catch-22
[02:26:11.180 --> 02:26:13.260]  because then we're gonna try to get some more in
[02:26:13.260 --> 02:26:14.380]  and then it's just down the road.
[02:26:14.380 --> 02:26:15.980]  It's just hard to secure this stuff.
[02:26:15.980 --> 02:26:18.420]  And you gotta deal with the DEA and the rest of it
[02:26:18.420 --> 02:26:22.660]  because the stupid methods, pure iodine I guess is used.
[02:26:22.660 --> 02:26:24.460]  You can't use it once it's in the palm oil for that,
[02:26:24.460 --> 02:26:26.220]  but it's used and so it's all a big
[02:26:27.300 --> 02:26:28.500]  severeocracy in this country
[02:26:28.500 --> 02:26:30.260]  or becoming just like Europe or something.
[02:26:30.260 --> 02:26:32.700]  And it's always because of what criminals do,
[02:26:32.700 --> 02:26:35.660]  normal people get their lives restrict.
[02:26:35.660 --> 02:26:37.220]  Well, I'm tired of that.
[02:26:37.220 --> 02:26:42.220]  So infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:26:43.180 --> 02:26:44.860]  I got so angry earlier
[02:26:44.860 --> 02:26:46.460]  and it's spontaneous.
[02:26:46.460 --> 02:26:49.660]  I mean, that's not me like I'm a WWF wrestler or something.
[02:26:51.660 --> 02:26:53.740]  I ran into the undertaker in Austin this morning.
[02:26:53.740 --> 02:26:55.740]  I was downtown taking care of some business,
[02:26:55.740 --> 02:26:57.300]  drove by the governor's mansion
[02:26:57.300 --> 02:27:00.740]  and they had guys out there with a M-Force,
[02:27:01.860 --> 02:27:03.980]  ever seen the state police with the M-Force,
[02:27:03.980 --> 02:27:05.260]  might be an ISIS threat or something.
[02:27:05.260 --> 02:27:06.940]  And then I went and took care of some business
[02:27:06.940 --> 02:27:09.020]  and I'm like, aren't you a professional wrestler?
[02:27:09.020 --> 02:27:10.580]  Yeah, I'm the undertaker.
[02:27:10.580 --> 02:27:11.860]  She wasn't in his makeup and everything,
[02:27:11.860 --> 02:27:16.100]  but still a very imposing looking, a scary looking guy.
[02:27:16.100 --> 02:27:17.620]  One of the scariest looking guys I've ever seen.
[02:27:17.620 --> 02:27:18.740]  I've seen some big guys.
[02:27:18.740 --> 02:27:21.140]  I was like, man, no wonder you're a professional wrestler.
[02:27:21.140 --> 02:27:22.220]  Certainly had a presence,
[02:27:22.220 --> 02:27:25.740]  but well, no answer to telling that story.
[02:27:25.740 --> 02:27:27.620]  I was about to get into something else this morning.
[02:27:27.620 --> 02:27:32.380]  Oh, one of the reasons that I am successful
[02:27:32.380 --> 02:27:34.220]  is that we have a nation and a world
[02:27:34.220 --> 02:27:36.900]  because of television, eight hours a day on average now
[02:27:36.900 --> 02:27:39.060]  as they were reporting yesterday on the BBC.
[02:27:39.060 --> 02:27:42.980]  In the West, eight hours of screen time,
[02:27:42.980 --> 02:27:46.420]  this was not just TV, of media,
[02:27:46.420 --> 02:27:49.420]  of digital media screen delivered,
[02:27:49.420 --> 02:27:50.460]  that people are just,
[02:27:50.460 --> 02:27:52.180]  they've seen millions of simulated murders,
[02:27:52.180 --> 02:27:53.740]  monsters busting out of hearts,
[02:27:53.740 --> 02:27:55.780]  the planet blowing up hundreds of times,
[02:27:55.780 --> 02:27:57.420]  earthquakes, sand and dress.
[02:27:59.820 --> 02:28:02.300]  And so they can't register real threats
[02:28:02.300 --> 02:28:03.780]  when they're actually happening.
[02:28:03.780 --> 02:28:05.260]  It's learned helplessness.
[02:28:05.260 --> 02:28:07.140]  It's mass Stockholm syndrome is what I call it.
[02:28:07.140 --> 02:28:09.900]  That's my term and me.
[02:28:09.900 --> 02:28:13.740]  I mean, I start thinking about how I have to clear cookies
[02:28:13.740 --> 02:28:16.420]  and go through a bunch of hassles, not to be cheated.
[02:28:16.420 --> 02:28:19.180]  I mean, I could be trying to buy a Hugo Boss shirt
[02:28:19.180 --> 02:28:23.500]  and it says 120 and I clear cookies
[02:28:23.500 --> 02:28:24.700]  because I don't like going to shopping malls.
[02:28:24.700 --> 02:28:26.740]  You know, I buy clothes a few times a year online
[02:28:26.740 --> 02:28:31.740]  and it's like $55 and then no one's telling you to do that.
[02:28:33.180 --> 02:28:35.540]  No one's explaining to you
[02:28:35.540 --> 02:28:38.020]  that if you're middle class or whatever
[02:28:38.020 --> 02:28:39.500]  or you buy a lot of stuff on a computer,
[02:28:39.500 --> 02:28:41.140]  say at your office, a lot of plane tickets,
[02:28:41.140 --> 02:28:43.340]  it thinks you're rich and just cheats you.
[02:28:44.820 --> 02:28:46.420]  Stores, in fact, I saw this years ago,
[02:28:46.420 --> 02:28:50.780]  will actually face scan you and they have a database
[02:28:50.780 --> 02:28:51.980]  they got from Facebook.
[02:28:51.980 --> 02:28:54.060]  You can look this up, forget which store,
[02:28:54.060 --> 02:28:55.260]  a couple of them in New York
[02:28:55.260 --> 02:28:56.740]  and then it will digitally,
[02:28:56.740 --> 02:28:58.460]  they won't have price tags on it.
[02:28:59.900 --> 02:29:01.620]  Kind of like the kiosk will sit there
[02:29:01.620 --> 02:29:04.980]  and in fact the other day I was at the mall with my kids
[02:29:04.980 --> 02:29:09.460]  went to saw a movie and we walked over to the cell phone cases
[02:29:09.460 --> 02:29:11.860]  and I was looking to get another cell phone case
[02:29:11.860 --> 02:29:14.060]  and the guy was like, it's $45 and I went,
[02:29:14.980 --> 02:29:17.100]  but really you think I'll pay that,
[02:29:17.100 --> 02:29:19.540]  you just made that judgment, there's no price tags.
[02:29:19.540 --> 02:29:20.500]  What do you really sell them for?
[02:29:20.500 --> 02:29:22.700]  $15 or $20, is that your bottom?
[02:29:22.700 --> 02:29:26.220]  They was like, you are very smart, I like it, hold on.
[02:29:26.220 --> 02:29:29.220]  You are the man on the internet.
[02:29:29.220 --> 02:29:30.700]  How did you know this?
[02:29:30.700 --> 02:29:35.700]  I will give it to you for 20, for 20.
[02:29:35.780 --> 02:29:38.100]  Well, it's a digital version of that
[02:29:39.060 --> 02:29:41.140]  and no one's gonna tell you it's going on,
[02:29:41.140 --> 02:29:45.260]  they think it's funny, it's a conspiracy theory.
[02:29:45.260 --> 02:29:47.460]  So go pay triple or quadruple or 10 times
[02:29:47.460 --> 02:29:49.540]  for your plane tickets, fine, don't listen to me.
[02:29:49.540 --> 02:29:53.060]  I'm evil, I'm racist, I'm horrible, we'll be back,
[02:29:53.060 --> 02:29:53.900]  stay with us.
[02:29:53.900 --> 02:29:56.420]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:56.420 --> 02:30:01.420]  Just passed by Congress, the USA Freedom Act.
[02:30:04.580 --> 02:30:06.700]  Well, not real freedom, but the kind of freedom
[02:30:06.700 --> 02:30:09.620]  we act like we have in the USA.
[02:30:09.620 --> 02:30:12.220]  Think of it as SISPA for phone companies,
[02:30:12.220 --> 02:30:14.460]  a kind of cozy symbiotic relationship
[02:30:14.460 --> 02:30:16.100]  between the corporate oligarchy
[02:30:16.100 --> 02:30:17.700]  and the authoritarian government.
[02:30:19.740 --> 02:30:21.660]  The phone companies will now store your info
[02:30:21.660 --> 02:30:24.740]  and pass it on to the paranoid government on demand
[02:30:24.740 --> 02:30:26.620]  and the phone companies will be granted freedom
[02:30:26.620 --> 02:30:27.780]  from liability.
[02:30:27.780 --> 02:30:32.660]  Now that's real freedom, the kind only the big guys get.
[02:30:32.660 --> 02:30:35.580]  But wait, there's more, now Congress will be notified
[02:30:35.580 --> 02:30:37.580]  whenever the secret files a court,
[02:30:37.580 --> 02:30:40.060]  well, it's not really a court, just a single judge,
[02:30:40.060 --> 02:30:44.540]  reinterpets the law, that's great
[02:30:44.540 --> 02:30:46.140]  because they've been changing the law
[02:30:46.140 --> 02:30:47.780]  and not even telling us.
[02:30:47.780 --> 02:30:49.780]  Now they're gonna let us know,
[02:30:49.780 --> 02:30:54.180]  is it America great, the USA Freedom Act?
[02:30:54.180 --> 02:30:56.780]  Offer void, we're prohibited by law.

[02:31:17.820 --> 02:31:20.460]  because they are not of the very highest quality
[02:31:20.460 --> 02:31:22.940]  or because they're not 100% organic
[02:31:22.940 --> 02:31:24.660]  or because they don't ask all
[02:31:24.660 --> 02:31:27.180]  of the strictest toxicology tests there are

[02:32:30.860 --> 02:32:31.940]  For the last two years,
[02:32:31.940 --> 02:32:35.140]  I've been working with top doctors, nutritionist and chemist

[02:33:02.300 --> 02:33:04.700]  The British are coming, the British are coming.
[02:33:04.700 --> 02:33:09.700]  Now the ride of Paul Revere set the nation on its ear
[02:33:11.420 --> 02:33:14.820]  and the shock that Lexington heard round the world.
[02:33:14.820 --> 02:33:17.740]  When the British fired in the early dawn,
[02:33:17.740 --> 02:33:19.940]  the war of independence had begun.
[02:33:19.940 --> 02:33:22.940]  The die was cast, the rebel flag unfurled
[02:33:24.300 --> 02:33:27.940]  and on to Concord, march the foe to seize the arsenal.
[02:33:27.940 --> 02:33:31.940]  There you know, waiting folks, searching all around.
[02:33:33.100 --> 02:33:35.580]  Shall our militia stop them in their tracks?
[02:33:35.580 --> 02:33:38.020]  At the Old North Bridge, we turn them back
[02:33:38.020 --> 02:33:41.180]  and chase those red-coast back to Boston Town.
[02:33:41.180 --> 02:33:46.180]  And the shock around the world was a start for the revolution.
[02:33:46.180 --> 02:33:49.180]  The men and men were ready for all the moves.
[02:33:50.180 --> 02:33:55.180]  Take your powder, take your gun before General Washington
[02:33:55.180 --> 02:33:59.180]  hurry when there's not an hour to lose.
[02:33:59.180 --> 02:34:03.180]  It happened that they had planned if the British was ever to come over here
[02:34:03.180 --> 02:34:06.180]  that they had put a light up in this high church steeple
[02:34:06.180 --> 02:34:08.180]  and Paul went down there to look
[02:34:08.180 --> 02:34:13.180]  and shone up, there was the light burning brighter than day.
[02:34:13.180 --> 02:34:16.180]  Well, Paul, he jumped on his old horse and he lit out.
[02:34:16.180 --> 02:34:19.180]  He didn't know where he was going, but he knew he had to go somewhere.
[02:34:19.180 --> 02:34:21.180]  Oh, I wish you could have seen it.
[02:34:21.180 --> 02:34:24.180]  That old horse with his ears laid back in his nostrils wide
[02:34:24.180 --> 02:34:26.180]  open a sucking in wind like a jet engine
[02:34:26.180 --> 02:34:29.180]  feet pounding on them cobblestones striking off sparks.
[02:34:29.180 --> 02:34:31.180]  Paul, a holding on for dear life
[02:34:31.180 --> 02:34:33.180]  and a hollering at the top of his lungs.
[02:34:33.180 --> 02:34:36.180]  He says, the British is coming, the British is coming.
[02:34:36.180 --> 02:34:39.180]  Get your gun, we're going to have us a revolution.
[02:34:39.180 --> 02:34:43.180]  And them farmers come up piling out of the hay like bead out of beehive.
[02:34:43.180 --> 02:34:45.180]  Minute men there's called.
[02:34:45.180 --> 02:34:46.180]  What's minute mean?
[02:34:46.180 --> 02:34:47.180]  Minute men.
[02:34:47.180 --> 02:34:50.180]  There's fellas that had to be ready at a minute's notice
[02:34:50.180 --> 02:34:52.180]  and when Paul comes screeching down the road that way
[02:34:52.180 --> 02:34:55.180]  they grab their guns and head out behind the weeds
[02:34:55.180 --> 02:34:58.180]  and walls and trees and everywhere.
[02:34:58.180 --> 02:35:01.180]  And when the British come pranks and long haul dressed up
[02:35:01.180 --> 02:35:03.180]  and in their red suits
[02:35:03.180 --> 02:35:06.180]  they let them have it.
[02:35:06.180 --> 02:35:09.180]  It was a sight to see.
[02:35:09.180 --> 02:35:11.180]  And then it happened.
[02:35:11.180 --> 02:35:13.180]  They fired the gun.
[02:35:13.180 --> 02:35:15.180]  They fired the gun.
[02:35:15.180 --> 02:35:17.180]  And the shot was so loud
[02:35:17.180 --> 02:35:21.180]  it was heard clear around the world.
[02:35:21.180 --> 02:35:23.180]  Oh, get out.
[02:35:23.180 --> 02:35:34.180]  That's the way this country started.
[02:35:34.180 --> 02:35:38.180]  And now our media sycophantically worships the Queen of England
[02:35:38.180 --> 02:35:41.180]  and her grandson and their babies
[02:35:41.180 --> 02:35:44.180]  and celebrate them like they're greater than Jesus Christ.
[02:35:44.180 --> 02:35:48.180]  All I see the British monarchy, Transylvanian interlopers
[02:35:48.180 --> 02:35:51.180]  all I see them as
[02:35:51.180 --> 02:35:54.180]  is like Kim Jong-un, he's third generation royalty.
[02:35:54.180 --> 02:35:58.180]  Even mainstream media now describes it as a royal dynasty.
[02:35:58.180 --> 02:36:01.180]  It is anathema
[02:36:01.180 --> 02:36:07.180]  incontrovertibly the opposite of what a free republic is.
[02:36:07.180 --> 02:36:10.180]  By the way, free republics are cutting edge
[02:36:10.180 --> 02:36:13.180]  and are wealthy and are loved.
[02:36:13.180 --> 02:36:15.180]  They have the biggest middle classes.
[02:36:15.180 --> 02:36:17.180]  They produce the most science, the most art,
[02:36:17.180 --> 02:36:21.180]  the most literature and are dominant.
[02:36:21.180 --> 02:36:23.180]  People that are into freedom are winners.
[02:36:23.180 --> 02:36:27.180]  People that are into tyranny are losers.
[02:36:27.180 --> 02:36:30.180]  And I don't know why we want a bunch of losers
[02:36:30.180 --> 02:36:32.180]  running our country and our world.
[02:36:32.180 --> 02:36:34.180]  America didn't even have to militarily invade countries
[02:36:34.180 --> 02:36:35.180]  56 years ago.
[02:36:35.180 --> 02:36:37.180]  People wanted us to come in.
[02:36:37.180 --> 02:36:38.180]  They wanted to adopt what we were doing
[02:36:38.180 --> 02:36:39.180]  because we were freer.
[02:36:39.180 --> 02:36:40.180]  We weren't perfect.
[02:36:40.180 --> 02:36:42.180]  But the media hyped on our problems
[02:36:42.180 --> 02:36:44.180]  and gave us this guilt culture
[02:36:44.180 --> 02:36:47.180]  and then brought in a new system
[02:36:47.180 --> 02:36:50.180]  to replace what was there, something even worse.
[02:36:50.180 --> 02:36:52.180]  A tyranny you don't see on the surface,
[02:36:52.180 --> 02:36:55.180]  but it's there, rotting like cancer
[02:36:55.180 --> 02:36:58.180]  that you didn't know was in your guts
[02:36:58.180 --> 02:37:00.180]  till it kills you.
[02:37:00.180 --> 02:37:02.180]  And now we're starting to become aware
[02:37:02.180 --> 02:37:04.180]  of the fact that it's happening.
[02:37:04.180 --> 02:37:07.180]  You know, I've talked a lot about Hollywood.
[02:37:07.180 --> 02:37:08.180]  I don't know Vince Vaughn.
[02:37:08.180 --> 02:37:11.180]  I don't know Robert Duvall, huge fan of Robert Duvall,
[02:37:11.180 --> 02:37:15.180]  like some of the movies of Vince Vaughn, funny guy.
[02:37:15.180 --> 02:37:17.180]  I mean, I knew years ago folks that knew Vince Vaughn
[02:37:17.180 --> 02:37:22.180]  and said that he was aware of what was going on.
[02:37:22.180 --> 02:37:24.180]  But, I mean, so's Motley Crue.
[02:37:24.180 --> 02:37:26.180]  I guess I know that for multiple folks,
[02:37:26.180 --> 02:37:28.180]  but it doesn't mean they're doing anything
[02:37:28.180 --> 02:37:29.180]  against the New World Order.
[02:37:29.180 --> 02:37:30.180]  I guess they are.
[02:37:30.180 --> 02:37:31.180]  A little bit, I guess, in their shows,
[02:37:31.180 --> 02:37:34.180]  flashing up clips of my videos.
[02:37:34.180 --> 02:37:39.180]  But the point is, is that 95% of the Hollywood folks I know,
[02:37:39.180 --> 02:37:43.180]  names as big or bigger than Robert Duvall,
[02:37:43.180 --> 02:37:47.180]  will not go public on air.
[02:37:47.180 --> 02:37:49.180]  Some of the most famous musicians,
[02:37:49.180 --> 02:37:52.180]  and I'm talking about huge musicians, rock stars like,
[02:37:52.180 --> 02:37:55.180]  you know, Billy Corrigan smashing pumpkins
[02:37:55.180 --> 02:37:59.180]  or folks like Dave Mustaine and Megadeth,
[02:37:59.180 --> 02:38:01.180]  they have the courage to speak out and say something.
[02:38:01.180 --> 02:38:04.180]  They're folks bigger than they are who won't speak out.
[02:38:04.180 --> 02:38:06.180]  You're going to lose everything if you don't.
[02:38:06.180 --> 02:38:09.180]  So Robert Duvall has come out on The Howard Stern Show
[02:38:09.180 --> 02:38:11.180]  and said he's not going to vote for Hillary.
[02:38:11.180 --> 02:38:12.180]  That's just more of the same.
[02:38:12.180 --> 02:38:14.180]  He doesn't like the Republicans either.
[02:38:14.180 --> 02:38:16.180]  He'll probably vote libertarian, maybe Rand Paul.
[02:38:16.180 --> 02:38:20.180]  That article's on infowarch.com.
[02:38:20.180 --> 02:38:23.180]  That just makes me like him that much more.
[02:38:23.180 --> 02:38:26.180]  But, he's so good.
[02:38:26.180 --> 02:38:28.180]  That's an amazing actor right there.
[02:38:28.180 --> 02:38:30.180]  From Killa Mockingbird to THX113.
[02:38:30.180 --> 02:38:32.180]  That guy's been in movies for almost 60 years.
[02:38:32.180 --> 02:38:33.180]  A true icon.
[02:38:33.180 --> 02:38:39.180]  He's so good in the fling blade, just everything.
[02:38:39.180 --> 02:38:42.180]  I don't even like movies like Days of Thunder,
[02:38:42.180 --> 02:38:45.180]  but man, he's in it all watching and I'm going to see it on.
[02:38:45.180 --> 02:38:49.180]  Vince Vaughn, you know why I like Robert Duvall?
[02:38:49.180 --> 02:38:52.180]  He reminds me of the Texans I grew up around.
[02:38:52.180 --> 02:38:54.180]  Those guys are all dead now.
[02:38:54.180 --> 02:38:57.180]  They acted and talked just like Robert Duvall,
[02:38:57.180 --> 02:38:59.180]  but with a real deal.
[02:38:59.180 --> 02:39:01.180]  Always real happy.
[02:39:01.180 --> 02:39:04.180]  I tell you son, before we go shooting, before we go do this work,
[02:39:04.180 --> 02:39:08.180]  let's pull over and have some fun and get a hamburger.
[02:39:08.180 --> 02:39:11.180]  They made the most simple thing sound like fun.
[02:39:11.180 --> 02:39:16.180]  They just always had a good attitude.
[02:39:16.180 --> 02:39:19.180]  The opposite of what this country's become, but excuse me.
[02:39:19.180 --> 02:39:21.180]  Vince Vaughn is as pro-gun as it gets,
[02:39:21.180 --> 02:39:23.180]  and I meant to cover this two days ago.
[02:39:23.180 --> 02:39:26.180]  I just got busy and didn't, but they're going to come after it.
[02:39:26.180 --> 02:39:30.180]  There's a new article out at infowarch.com by Paul Watson.
[02:39:30.180 --> 02:39:34.180]  Vince Vaughn will be shunned by Hollywood after outing himself as a conservative.
[02:39:34.180 --> 02:39:38.180]  Author says guns should be allowed in schools to stop mass shootings and more.
[02:39:38.180 --> 02:39:41.180]  Before I read some of his quotes here,
[02:39:41.180 --> 02:39:43.180]  if you vote for organic food by buying it,
[02:39:43.180 --> 02:39:45.180]  20 years ago you couldn't find it anywhere.
[02:39:45.180 --> 02:39:47.180]  Now it's everywhere and now the price is going down
[02:39:47.180 --> 02:39:49.180]  because everybody's getting in on the market.
[02:39:49.180 --> 02:39:51.180]  It's huge.
[02:39:51.180 --> 02:39:53.180]  They're taking fluoride out of the water.
[02:39:53.180 --> 02:39:55.180]  It'll take years to do, but the announcement's been made.
[02:39:55.180 --> 02:39:57.180]  They're cutting it by half and then phasing it out.
[02:39:57.180 --> 02:39:58.180]  We're having victories.
[02:39:58.180 --> 02:40:01.180]  People are listening, not just to us, but they're getting.
[02:40:01.180 --> 02:40:04.180]  A lot of people get it because they take their 18-month-old and they get a shot.
[02:40:04.180 --> 02:40:06.180]  They're fine. They're talking. They give them a shot.
[02:40:06.180 --> 02:40:07.180]  The kid has a convulsion.
[02:40:07.180 --> 02:40:09.180]  They don't wake up for two days.
[02:40:09.180 --> 02:40:12.180]  Finally, they start walking again in a few months and talking,
[02:40:12.180 --> 02:40:15.180]  and they go, thank God you're not totally brain damaged.
[02:40:15.180 --> 02:40:19.180]  And I get these letters sometimes with teardrops on them.
[02:40:19.180 --> 02:40:21.180]  You see where someone was crying about,
[02:40:21.180 --> 02:40:23.180]  oh my God, I wish I would have listened to you.
[02:40:23.180 --> 02:40:24.180]  I made fun of you.
[02:40:24.180 --> 02:40:26.180]  Let me tell you, folks, this isn't a game, as I say.
[02:40:26.180 --> 02:40:29.180]  This is not a joke.
[02:40:29.180 --> 02:40:36.180]  And if we can protect people like Vince Vaughn when they come out and tell the truth,
[02:40:36.180 --> 02:40:39.180]  if we go and support his films when they come out,
[02:40:39.180 --> 02:40:41.180]  which is already happening with Christian films,
[02:40:41.180 --> 02:40:44.180]  they won't be able to destroy him and then everybody will come out.
[02:40:44.180 --> 02:40:50.180]  And let me tell you, folks, we have an article out about this today.
[02:40:50.180 --> 02:40:53.180]  I'd say half of Hollywood is libertarian.
[02:40:53.180 --> 02:40:57.180]  Another 20% or so are what you call mainline conservatives.
[02:40:57.180 --> 02:41:05.180]  It's only maybe 30% that would really be liberal, maybe 25%.
[02:41:05.180 --> 02:41:12.180]  I mean, in Hollywood, folks, anti-New World Order, awareness of the globalist agenda,
[02:41:12.180 --> 02:41:19.180]  it's like libertarian meets smart liberal, anti-GMO, anti-vaccine meets, they get it.
[02:41:19.180 --> 02:41:21.180]  They don't want to be a conservative.
[02:41:21.180 --> 02:41:22.180]  They don't want to be a liberal.
[02:41:22.180 --> 02:41:24.180]  They're sick of it all.
[02:41:24.180 --> 02:41:30.180]  But let me tell you, they're under the thumb of Sumner, Redstone, and others.
[02:41:30.180 --> 02:41:32.180]  And it's so empty out there.
[02:41:32.180 --> 02:41:33.180]  It's so backstabbing.
[02:41:33.180 --> 02:41:34.180]  It's so sick.
[02:41:34.180 --> 02:41:40.180]  Most of Hollywood's moved out to Tennessee or to Texas or to Montreal.
[02:41:40.180 --> 02:41:43.180]  I mean, they're all leaving.
[02:41:43.180 --> 02:41:47.180]  And there's a real revolution because the artist.
[02:41:47.180 --> 02:41:49.180]  And I wish I could tell you the names.
[02:41:49.180 --> 02:41:56.180]  I mean, it's just the biggest in rock and roll, the biggest in movies, the biggest.
[02:41:56.180 --> 02:41:59.180]  The biggest.
[02:41:59.180 --> 02:42:01.180]  It's incredible.
[02:42:01.180 --> 02:42:03.180]  But they're like, I just want you to know I appreciate what you're doing.
[02:42:03.180 --> 02:42:09.180]  I just want you to know that, but, you know, I just can't go public.
[02:42:09.180 --> 02:42:10.180]  They'll come after us.
[02:42:10.180 --> 02:42:11.180]  They'll destroy us.
[02:42:11.180 --> 02:42:12.180]  They'll go, I understand.
[02:42:12.180 --> 02:42:13.180]  That's fine.
[02:42:13.180 --> 02:42:17.180]  Then there's kind of folks that ride the fence who I admire their courage for that.
[02:42:17.180 --> 02:42:20.180]  Like Joe Perry of Aerosmith's, a huge listener.
[02:42:20.180 --> 02:42:21.180]  We used to talk all the time.
[02:42:21.180 --> 02:42:23.180]  I just, we never have time to talk.
[02:42:23.180 --> 02:42:25.180]  He dedicated his solo album to me.
[02:42:25.180 --> 02:42:28.180]  And I guess that was his, his, his, his thing.
[02:42:28.180 --> 02:42:30.180]  Don't dedicate it to me, brother.
[02:42:30.180 --> 02:42:32.180]  Dedicate it to your children's future.
[02:42:32.180 --> 02:42:35.180]  You know, you're, and a lot of these guys are classy.
[02:42:35.180 --> 02:42:38.180]  So they think it's kind of rude to speak out.
[02:42:38.180 --> 02:42:41.180]  And that's kind of conservative, you know, to not be running around saying it.
[02:42:41.180 --> 02:42:42.180]  But you know, we're in trouble.
[02:42:42.180 --> 02:42:44.180]  It's time to yell and scream.
[02:42:44.180 --> 02:42:46.180]  But it's just you name it.
[02:42:46.180 --> 02:42:47.180]  You name it.
[02:42:47.180 --> 02:42:52.180]  I wish I could tell you.
[02:42:52.180 --> 02:42:57.180]  But, you know, they killed John Lennon because he was waking up to the New World Order.
[02:42:57.180 --> 02:42:59.180]  He was giving speeches against eugenics.
[02:42:59.180 --> 02:43:01.180]  He was saying the drug war was government run.
[02:43:01.180 --> 02:43:06.180]  I mean, he really was making a turn and they killed him.
[02:43:06.180 --> 02:43:08.180]  And that's a fact.
[02:43:08.180 --> 02:43:10.180]  Then partially declassified.
[02:43:10.180 --> 02:43:15.180]  Senator Strom Thurmond said, we got to take out John Lennon and a month later he was dead.
[02:43:15.180 --> 02:43:20.180]  So that's why they're, I mean, the stuff they, I mean, Mark Cuban,
[02:43:20.180 --> 02:43:22.180]  I've been in speakerphone conversations with him.
[02:43:22.180 --> 02:43:28.180]  He was going to put out loose chains that I produced worldwide on a thousand screens starting in the U.S.
[02:43:28.180 --> 02:43:32.180]  And the White House called him up and said, we're going to indict you for insider trading.
[02:43:32.180 --> 02:43:34.180]  Just like Martha Stewart.
[02:43:34.180 --> 02:43:36.180]  And you better drop that film.
[02:43:36.180 --> 02:43:39.180]  The feds came and then I didn't even know, I talked about it on air,
[02:43:39.180 --> 02:43:42.180]  that they came out in the New York Times a year later, he published emails.
[02:43:42.180 --> 02:43:44.180]  They sent him saying, we're going to get you for this.
[02:43:44.180 --> 02:43:48.180]  And that's why they had to drop the charges was because they admitted it was political.
[02:43:48.180 --> 02:43:51.180]  So, I mean, I get why people are scared, but let me tell you,
[02:43:51.180 --> 02:43:55.180]  they might try to indict Vince Vaughn for this because listen,
[02:43:55.180 --> 02:44:00.180]  if one domino falls, it could trigger them all at the house of cards I talked about.
[02:44:00.180 --> 02:44:02.180]  You don't have to pull the bottom card out.
[02:44:02.180 --> 02:44:04.180]  You pull one out in the middle or up at the top.
[02:44:04.180 --> 02:44:10.180]  It's going to collapse the whole thing.
[02:44:10.180 --> 02:44:14.180]  Or we pull one out at the top, a few collapse folks see it's not invincible.
[02:44:14.180 --> 02:44:21.180]  Now the whole, I mean, we're standing at the edge of total history.
[02:44:21.180 --> 02:44:25.180]  We're standing at the edge of ultramassive victory.
[02:44:25.180 --> 02:44:27.180]  Doesn't mean there won't be new evils to fight.
[02:44:27.180 --> 02:44:31.180]  Doesn't mean the prophecy won't be revealed and won't be fulfilled,
[02:44:31.180 --> 02:44:34.180]  but in God's time.
[02:44:34.180 --> 02:44:37.180]  And God commands us to take action against corruption.
[02:44:37.180 --> 02:44:40.180]  Even don't believe in God. You're not alive. You're not sending it.
[02:44:40.180 --> 02:44:41.180]  You're not good.
[02:44:41.180 --> 02:44:44.180]  If you don't have an instinct to fight criminals, to fight gangs,
[02:44:44.180 --> 02:44:46.180]  that's not civilization.
[02:44:46.180 --> 02:44:52.180]  Farming and ranching and metalurgy and building and mathematics and science
[02:44:52.180 --> 02:44:56.180]  and space exploration and art and literature.
[02:44:56.180 --> 02:44:59.180]  I forget who it was.
[02:44:59.180 --> 02:45:02.180]  One of the big 60s counterculture guys, most of them were quacks,
[02:45:02.180 --> 02:45:03.180]  but this guy knew what he was talking about.
[02:45:03.180 --> 02:45:06.180]  Read a couple of his books. What was his name?
[02:45:06.180 --> 02:45:11.180]  He said that if you want to defeat the ruling class, make art.
[02:45:11.180 --> 02:45:16.180]  If you want to fight the corrupt system, make art.
[02:45:16.180 --> 02:45:17.180]  It'll pop in my head.
[02:45:17.180 --> 02:45:21.180]  He was like the founder of the Church of the Subgenius.
[02:45:21.180 --> 02:45:22.180]  I hate it when I can't remember a name.
[02:45:22.180 --> 02:45:24.180]  It's just right there on the tip of my tongue,
[02:45:24.180 --> 02:45:27.180]  right there on the tip of my cerebral cortex.
[02:45:27.180 --> 02:45:29.180]  And that's what you do.
[02:45:29.180 --> 02:45:31.180]  You just do independent stuff.
[02:45:31.180 --> 02:45:33.180]  You get back to the land.
[02:45:33.180 --> 02:45:36.180]  That means inviting neighbors over and having a barbecue.
[02:45:36.180 --> 02:45:40.180]  Instead of sitting down and having imaginary friends on Breaking Bad
[02:45:40.180 --> 02:45:42.180]  or House of Cards.
[02:45:42.180 --> 02:45:44.180]  And it doesn't mean that sometimes you don't watch Breaking Bad
[02:45:44.180 --> 02:45:47.180]  or House of Cards, but you're aware it's propaganda.
[02:45:47.180 --> 02:45:48.180]  You're aware there's subliminals.
[02:45:48.180 --> 02:45:50.180]  It just means most of the time.
[02:45:50.180 --> 02:45:54.180]  I mean, I want to take my kids kayaking this evening.
[02:45:54.180 --> 02:45:57.180]  I want to research or read a book.
[02:45:57.180 --> 02:46:00.180]  I want to go out with friends and eat.
[02:46:00.180 --> 02:46:03.180]  I do not. That's more interesting to walk around
[02:46:03.180 --> 02:46:05.180]  and see bats flying around in the evening
[02:46:05.180 --> 02:46:08.180]  and to be downtown and see a drone flying through the middle of the city.
[02:46:08.180 --> 02:46:09.180]  A huge one last night.
[02:46:09.180 --> 02:46:10.180]  I got video of it, by the way.
[02:46:10.180 --> 02:46:12.180]  I haven't put it on air yet.
[02:46:12.180 --> 02:46:14.180]  There's a whole universe out there.
[02:46:14.180 --> 02:46:17.180]  And Jupiter comes out and shattered in the moon
[02:46:17.180 --> 02:46:19.180]  and night hawks are flying around.
[02:46:19.180 --> 02:46:21.180]  I mean, I'm going to go in there and sit in a couch
[02:46:21.180 --> 02:46:25.180]  and watch some fake things somebody made.
[02:46:25.180 --> 02:46:28.180]  Yeah, sometimes I want to turn my brain off and do that.
[02:46:28.180 --> 02:46:31.180]  But that's when I want to turn my brain off.
[02:46:31.180 --> 02:46:33.180]  My brain's usually on.
[02:46:33.180 --> 02:46:36.180]  Most people's brains are off all the time.
[02:46:36.180 --> 02:46:40.180]  And I talked about earlier,
[02:46:40.180 --> 02:46:42.180]  and I'm not going to sit here and talk about how I'm great.
[02:46:42.180 --> 02:46:43.180]  I'm nobody.
[02:46:43.180 --> 02:46:46.180]  But at least I don't have learned helplessness
[02:46:46.180 --> 02:46:48.180]  or Stockholm syndrome.
[02:46:48.180 --> 02:46:52.180]  Man, when I started thinking about how they try to screw me online
[02:46:52.180 --> 02:46:56.180]  because I'm middle class and try to charge me more with algorithms
[02:46:56.180 --> 02:46:59.180]  and that they do that
[02:46:59.180 --> 02:47:03.180]  and that I have to compete against companies that will do stuff like that,
[02:47:03.180 --> 02:47:04.180]  it's criminal.
[02:47:04.180 --> 02:47:06.180]  It makes me personally feel cheated.
[02:47:06.180 --> 02:47:09.180]  But then I think about how dumb the public is
[02:47:09.180 --> 02:47:11.180]  not even believing that stuff goes on
[02:47:11.180 --> 02:47:13.180]  because they've been given an artificial instinct
[02:47:13.180 --> 02:47:15.180]  to never defend themselves.
[02:47:15.180 --> 02:47:19.180]  The subliminal cues and the subliminal programming,
[02:47:19.180 --> 02:47:22.180]  the subconscious commands
[02:47:22.180 --> 02:47:25.180]  are when you're being chewed on by wolves
[02:47:25.180 --> 02:47:29.180]  present your belly for more enjoyable eating.
[02:47:29.180 --> 02:47:32.180]  You know, maybe lay yourself on a tablecloth
[02:47:32.180 --> 02:47:34.180]  and light some candles.
[02:47:34.180 --> 02:47:37.180]  See, I'm not going to lay on the table with my belly out of the wolves
[02:47:37.180 --> 02:47:38.180]  and light some candles.
[02:47:38.180 --> 02:47:39.180]  I don't care.
[02:47:39.180 --> 02:47:42.180]  Like I said, a 14-foot vampire comes through the door.
[02:47:42.180 --> 02:47:43.180]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[02:47:43.180 --> 02:47:47.180]  I'm going to throw myself at it as viciously and as hatefully as I can
[02:47:47.180 --> 02:47:50.180]  to take it out because I'm going to die on my feet.
[02:47:50.180 --> 02:47:54.180]  I'm not going to get up on the table and lay out a nice,
[02:47:54.180 --> 02:47:56.180]  pretty white linen tablecloth
[02:47:56.180 --> 02:47:58.180]  and get up there and take my clothes off
[02:47:58.180 --> 02:48:00.180]  and just lay there for the vampires and say,
[02:48:00.180 --> 02:48:01.180]  Come on in, baby.
[02:48:01.180 --> 02:48:02.180]  Hey, man, surf's up.
[02:48:02.180 --> 02:48:03.180]  Jump on me.
[02:48:03.180 --> 02:48:04.180]  That's not happening.
[02:48:04.180 --> 02:48:06.180]  Being screwed over,
[02:48:06.180 --> 02:48:09.180]  watching my children live on a planet with a bunch of idiots,
[02:48:09.180 --> 02:48:12.180]  with a bunch of scum ruling over them isn't fun.
[02:48:12.180 --> 02:48:15.180]  And I will not sit here and put up with it.
[02:48:15.180 --> 02:48:17.180]  And that's the good news at the end of the day.
[02:48:17.180 --> 02:48:21.180]  It's just one average person joining with others on a radio show
[02:48:21.180 --> 02:48:24.180]  has already caused them massive problems
[02:48:24.180 --> 02:48:26.180]  and other people are attacking the globalists as well.
[02:48:26.180 --> 02:48:28.180]  And they're all honorable.
[02:48:28.180 --> 02:48:32.180]  You look at people like our last guest, Kirk Wiebe.
[02:48:32.180 --> 02:48:37.180]  Look at folks like Drake, Thomas Drake.
[02:48:37.180 --> 02:48:38.180]  You look at those guys.
[02:48:38.180 --> 02:48:40.180]  They all look honorable.
[02:48:40.180 --> 02:48:43.180]  They all have a loving, strong, manly look in their eyes.
[02:48:43.180 --> 02:48:45.180]  When you're around these people in person,
[02:48:45.180 --> 02:48:47.180]  you can feel the integrity.
[02:48:47.180 --> 02:48:48.180]  You can feel the strength.
[02:48:48.180 --> 02:48:49.180]  It feels good.
[02:48:49.180 --> 02:48:52.180]  When you're around buckets of sell-out crap,
[02:48:52.180 --> 02:48:55.180]  you can't wait to get away from them.
[02:48:55.180 --> 02:48:59.180]  What matters is the integrity at the end of the day.
[02:48:59.180 --> 02:49:02.180]  What matters is standing up and doing the right thing.
[02:49:02.180 --> 02:49:04.180]  And that's what builds a civilization.
[02:49:04.180 --> 02:49:06.180]  That's what builds a future.
[02:49:06.180 --> 02:49:10.180]  Not a bunch of con artists and scumbags lying to people.
[02:49:10.180 --> 02:49:17.180]  And what's happened is the criminals have gotten a critical mass now,
[02:49:17.180 --> 02:49:19.180]  where they've got so many people going along with them,
[02:49:19.180 --> 02:49:21.180]  they can point at us and say,
[02:49:21.180 --> 02:49:22.180]  we're the crazy ones.
[02:49:22.180 --> 02:49:24.180]  Yeah, you know what? I am crazy.
[02:49:24.180 --> 02:49:27.180]  You're right.
[02:49:27.180 --> 02:49:30.180]  I see these videos all the time where there'll be two or three guys,
[02:49:30.180 --> 02:49:33.180]  and two or three other guys will come up and punch them in the face,
[02:49:33.180 --> 02:49:35.180]  grab their wife's purse,
[02:49:35.180 --> 02:49:37.180]  and the men will just kind of cower,
[02:49:37.180 --> 02:49:39.180]  and then the thugs just beat them up.
[02:49:39.180 --> 02:49:41.180]  I mean, I'm not looking for trouble.
[02:49:41.180 --> 02:49:42.180]  I'm nothing special.
[02:49:42.180 --> 02:49:43.180]  I mean, you come out and punch me.
[02:49:43.180 --> 02:49:46.180]  I mean, I get as happy as hell because I turn into an animal.
[02:49:46.180 --> 02:49:48.180]  And it's not that I'm some killer.
[02:49:48.180 --> 02:49:53.180]  It's I'm designed to naturally want to attack someone that attacks me.
[02:49:53.180 --> 02:49:57.180]  And I don't know how they took your survival instinct and flushed it down the toilet.
[02:49:57.180 --> 02:49:59.180]  I don't know how they did this to us,
[02:49:59.180 --> 02:50:02.180]  but I'm telling you we've got to break the trance and realize
[02:50:02.180 --> 02:50:04.180]  that we're not going to physically fight these people right now.
[02:50:04.180 --> 02:50:07.180]  We're going to attack them with the truth and with their crimes.
[02:50:07.180 --> 02:50:09.180]  We're going to discredit them and we're going to destroy them.
[02:50:09.180 --> 02:50:12.180]  And you have to decide that they're evil,
[02:50:12.180 --> 02:50:14.180]  that you know they're screwing you over,
[02:50:14.180 --> 02:50:17.180]  that you want to bring them down and then give that problem to your mind.
[02:50:17.180 --> 02:50:21.180]  And your mind will start giving you the answers piece by piece, day by day.
[02:50:21.180 --> 02:50:25.180]  We will bring these globalists down.
[02:50:25.180 --> 02:50:35.180]  The rule of control free pieces of trash, psychotic, sociopathic, gibbering degenerates is coming to an end.
[02:50:35.180 --> 02:50:38.180]  Humanity is going to escape the AI takeover.
[02:50:38.180 --> 02:50:44.180]  Humanity is going to escape the devil's plan with God's help and go into the future.
[02:50:44.180 --> 02:50:48.180]  And the sell out churches with a bunch of glitterbug narcissists
[02:50:48.180 --> 02:50:52.180]  are going to go with their father the devil straight into hell.
[02:50:52.180 --> 02:51:19.180]  Final news straight ahead on this Wednesday, the third day of June 2015 transmission.

[02:53:58.180 --> 02:54:12.180]  Well, the Federal Reserve's come out and says everything's wonderful. The outlook is optimistic.
[02:54:12.180 --> 02:54:19.180]  There's the private offshore banks maneuvering the country towards total bankruptcy, but not before they've taken over the planet.
[02:54:19.180 --> 02:54:29.180]  Meanwhile, Obama hides trade deal details and WikiLeaks offers $100,000 bounty for the entire pact. I thought they already had it and wouldn't release it.
[02:54:29.180 --> 02:54:36.180]  Or are they saying give them money and they'll release it because I've heard them say that before. We need to get an answer on that.
[02:54:36.180 --> 02:54:44.180]  But don't worry, the federal government has indicted all these people from the Global Soccer Federation. That'll keep us all safe.
[02:54:44.180 --> 02:54:52.180]  Feminist accused Dr. Ruth, who is a big liberal feminist, of promoting rape culture when she answered questions on Twitter and said,
[02:54:52.180 --> 02:54:59.180]  yes, she's against rape, but women shouldn't get naked in bed with a man and then say later they raped him, which is the new feminist thing.
[02:54:59.180 --> 02:55:07.180]  As if anybody would want to hang around with any of these feminists I've seen. I mean, just, you know, they're pushing rape to act like all men are predators.
[02:55:07.180 --> 02:55:14.180]  If rape certainly goes on, the answer is to arm women and to train them in firearms use something the fake feminists will never do.
[02:55:14.180 --> 02:55:19.180]  Oh, they want women in the military, but they're always don't own firearms, call the police, pure bull.
[02:55:19.180 --> 02:55:25.180]  Oh, my two daughters are going to have firearms and they know how to use them and they're not going to just be murdered by a bunch of criminals.
[02:55:25.180 --> 02:55:31.180]  Sorry. Feminist accused sex expert Dr. Ruth, this is on infowars.com, promoting rape culture.
[02:55:31.180 --> 02:55:38.180]  She said she was 100% against rape and advised women that if they don't want to have sex with a man, they should not be naked with him in bed.
[02:55:38.180 --> 02:55:42.180]  That's risky behavior like crossing the street against the light.
[02:55:42.180 --> 02:55:47.180]  She also tweeted on Tuesday, if a driver hits you, he's legally in the wrong, but you're in the hospital.
[02:55:47.180 --> 02:55:50.180]  She says, just don't put yourself in a bad situation.
[02:55:50.180 --> 02:55:59.180]  Or it's like these women, you know, they're 20 years old at college, they get drunk with a bunch of drunk guys and then they, you know, sit there and go in the morning.
[02:55:59.180 --> 02:56:04.180]  We didn't do anything. I was passed out. No, they weren't passed out.
[02:56:04.180 --> 02:56:09.180]  And most of the time, and then nine times out of 10, it comes out in court cases.
[02:56:09.180 --> 02:56:15.180]  There was no rape in the lacrosse case. It's all made up.
[02:56:15.180 --> 02:56:20.180]  But there are rapists that grab your wife in the parking lot. They should get shot.
[02:56:20.180 --> 02:56:24.180]  And there are guys that drug people.
[02:56:24.180 --> 02:56:34.180]  I told this story, but about three years ago, I was out at a business meeting at night and I thought that my drink tastes a little bit weird.
[02:56:34.180 --> 02:56:38.180]  And I wasn't drinking. It was a non-alcoholic drink.
[02:56:38.180 --> 02:56:45.180]  And by the time I got home, I was almost crawling to the bed and I'd been hit.
[02:56:45.180 --> 02:56:50.180]  But there's just no way to prove it or deal with it. I looked into how to do anything.
[02:56:50.180 --> 02:56:54.180]  It's just too hard, but that's what happens when you're a public figure. I have been roofing before.
[02:56:54.180 --> 02:56:59.180]  And I guess it wasn't alcohol involved, so it wasn't a roofing. I've been drugged before and it was not...
[02:56:59.180 --> 02:57:03.180]  Thank God, I left pretty quick after that drink and I remember driving on. Whoa!
[02:57:03.180 --> 02:57:12.180]  And then by the time I got home, it was just like lights out. Certainly slept well, though.
[02:57:12.180 --> 02:57:18.180]  In fact, I'm not going to tell the rest of the story. I actually went back to the place and then...
[02:57:18.180 --> 02:57:22.180]  Never mind. I'm not going to tell the rest of it. We're basically out of time.
[02:57:22.180 --> 02:57:25.180]  I got to a lot of the news today. Not all of it.
[02:57:25.180 --> 02:57:29.180]  The nightly news is condensed, is focused, is hardcore with our great team.
[02:57:29.180 --> 02:57:32.180]  7 o'clock Central, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:57:32.180 --> 02:57:37.180]  We are going to be before the year ends in the next few months launching on the satellite and cable and other systems.
[02:57:37.180 --> 02:57:40.180]  So I've got that to go work on today.
[02:57:40.180 --> 02:57:46.180]  There's a whole other subject. Father of slain terrorist suspect says media promoting FBI narrative of killing.
[02:57:46.180 --> 02:57:49.180]  They said they're going to release the video of him coming at the police with a knife.
[02:57:49.180 --> 02:57:54.180]  Who knows if that's true? I just know they executed a guy, the FBI did, down in Florida.
[02:57:54.180 --> 02:58:00.180]  They shot him in the back of the head while he was basically in handcuffs and they covered that up and nobody got in trouble.
[02:58:00.180 --> 02:58:04.180]  So this is becoming murder squads. People say, what are you for the Boston bombing?
[02:58:04.180 --> 02:58:09.180]  Folks, the older brother worked for the CIA. That was a shut up. The Russians blew his cover.
[02:58:09.180 --> 02:58:12.180]  We're not being told the truth about the Boston bombing.
[02:58:12.180 --> 02:58:17.180]  That's just some of the news that's up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[02:58:17.180 --> 02:58:27.180]  That interview we did with the NSA whistleblower was towards the end, especially one of the most important, thought provoking, piercing interviews ever.
[02:58:27.180 --> 02:58:32.180]  And it was super important. We'll try to put that on YouTube tonight or tomorrow and then get it up on infowars.com.
[02:58:32.180 --> 02:58:36.180]  I mean, take this information, spread it to others. That's how we wake people up.
[02:58:36.180 --> 02:58:40.180]  All of you are just as important as I am or Ron Paul or anybody.
[02:58:40.180 --> 02:58:44.180]  Take action. You are the media. God bless you all.
[02:58:44.180 --> 02:59:12.180]  Great job crew.
