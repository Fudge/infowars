[00:00.000 --> 00:14.120]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.120 --> 00:33.120]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones it is Wednesday the 17th day
[00:33.120 --> 00:41.040]  of August 2011 we're gonna be live here for at least the next three hours we have a guest on
[00:41.040 --> 00:52.040]  of the last 30 minutes Ray McGovern who has some very pointed comments dealing with Rick Perry
[00:52.040 --> 00:58.160]  obviously the first thing I want to cover though is that Obama was confronted by a tea
[00:58.160 --> 01:07.920]  party member saying why did you call tea party or terrorist and Obama basically gave him a
[01:07.920 --> 01:13.200]  long rambling answer and then we'll blitzer asked him about it yesterday on singing in and
[01:13.200 --> 01:18.440]  this was the president's response to that here it is I've covered the Middle East for a long
[01:18.440 --> 01:23.640]  time covered terrorism for a long time and I have to tell you I'm worried that on the 10th
[01:23.640 --> 01:28.720]  anniversary approaching the 10th anniversary of 9 11 Al Qaeda what's left of Al Qaeda or
[01:28.720 --> 01:34.960]  their supporters will try to do something to seek revenge for your your killing been a lot
[01:34.960 --> 01:41.280]  how worried should we be about that how worried are you about that well look we are vigilant
[01:41.280 --> 01:48.920]  and constantly monitoring potential risks of terrorist attacks and I think that the men
[01:48.920 --> 01:55.480]  and women are intelligence agencies as well as the FBI have done a terrific job and Department
[01:55.480 --> 02:02.160]  of Homeland Security but the risk is always there and obviously on a seminal event like the
[02:02.160 --> 02:07.000]  10th anniversary of 9 11 that makes us more concerned it means we've got heightened awareness
[02:07.000 --> 02:13.840]  the biggest concern we have right now is not the launching of a major terrorist operation
[02:13.840 --> 02:19.680]  although that risk is always there the risk that we're especially concerned of right now is the
[02:19.680 --> 02:26.640]  lone wolf terrorist somebody with a single weapon being able to carry out wide scale
[02:26.640 --> 02:32.840]  massacres of the sort that we saw in Norway recently you know when you've got one person who is
[02:32.840 --> 02:40.240]  deranged or driven by a hateful ideology they can do a lot of damage and it's a lot harder to
[02:40.240 --> 02:48.720]  trace those lone wolf operators so we're spending a lot of time monitoring and gathering information
[02:48.720 --> 02:56.400]  I think that we generally have to stay vigilant there may be a little extra vigilance during
[02:56.400 --> 03:01.120]  9 11 on the other hand keep in mind the extraordinary progress we've made over the last couple of
[03:01.120 --> 03:06.720]  years in degrading al-Qaeda's capabilities they are a much weaker organization with much less
[03:06.720 --> 03:12.480]  capability than they had just two or three years ago so what I hear you saying is we don't have
[03:12.480 --> 03:18.320]  to worry about a spectacular 9 11 kind of event more like a lone wolf can do some damage kill a
[03:18.320 --> 03:23.760]  lot of people but not a nuclear or radiological or anything like that look as president of the
[03:23.760 --> 03:29.760]  United States I worry about all of it but I think that the most likely scenario that we
[03:29.760 --> 03:34.800]  have to guard against right now ends up being more of a lone wolf operation okay large
[03:37.840 --> 03:43.920]  now if you go look at his surrogates like the vice president and others they're saying that it's
[03:43.920 --> 03:50.480]  going to be tea partiers that are going to be attacking and you've seen that talking point
[03:50.480 --> 03:56.000]  now that the tea party people that want to get rid of the private fellow deserve the real tea party
[03:56.000 --> 04:01.680]  are basically terrorists and here's the AFP headline Obama threats over lone wolf attacks
[04:01.680 --> 04:06.560]  in September 11th looms so that was all branded as if it's an al-Qaeda lone wolf but when you get
[04:06.560 --> 04:14.080]  the actual FBI training manuals the alerts they're putting out almost all of it has to do with domestic
[04:14.080 --> 04:19.200]  quote right wing groups and of course you've heard that from the vice president and many others
[04:19.200 --> 04:24.000]  there are some detailed reports both Paul Watson and Kurt Nemo have written about this today
[04:24.000 --> 04:31.920]  at info wars.com and prisonplanet.com Obama's feared lone wolf attack could save his presidency
[04:32.720 --> 04:37.040]  and that's what we've been seeing these different statements out of White House
[04:37.760 --> 04:44.160]  analysts White House advisors and others and so that's where the major branding for all of this
[04:44.160 --> 04:50.880]  is going and they are clearly testing the waters and beta testing test ballooning whatever term you
[04:50.880 --> 04:58.160]  want to use launching October type surprises before the election to blame their political opposition
[04:58.160 --> 05:04.480]  it's the oldest trick in the book. Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's

[08:00.640 --> 08:06.320]  he's the t-rex of political talk alex jones on the gcn radio network
[08:08.480 --> 08:14.160]  okay we're taking a lot of calls today because i know that our listeners are chomping at the bit
[08:14.160 --> 08:19.680]  to respond to all of the incredible things that are happening in the world economy the unfolding
[08:19.680 --> 08:27.440]  global depression rick perry and michelle bachman now trying to channel uh ron paul trying to become
[08:27.440 --> 08:34.960]  ron paul uh you notice the system is praising that on fox news uh the the the neocons are praising
[08:34.960 --> 08:40.400]  it because they know michelle bachman uh former tax collector for the irs that pays the money to
[08:40.400 --> 08:45.920]  the private federal reserve and is not going to actually follow through on what she says
[08:45.920 --> 08:53.200]  if she's elected she's a famous flip-flopper uh just like rick perry is a completely deceptive
[08:53.200 --> 08:59.600]  duplicitous a political chameleon so when he calls it treacherous and almost treasonous that's a
[08:59.600 --> 09:06.240]  quote and then obama comes out and responds to him and says uh how dare you say that that's
[09:06.240 --> 09:15.120]  dangerous talk i've got those clips um it's all a part of elevating rick perry and uh now because
[09:15.120 --> 09:20.080]  it it looks like ron paul has a really good chance of winning he's winning most of straw polls
[09:20.080 --> 09:24.960]  almost all the scientific polls and just the general internet polls if you look at the at the
[09:24.960 --> 09:30.640]  spectrum of polls he's winning around 80 of them in the rest of the cases uh he's number two or
[09:30.640 --> 09:35.360]  number three but even when he's number two or number three uh as the daily show even illustrated
[09:35.360 --> 09:42.640]  in the drudge report uh linked to that yesterday it's now had millions of views um on every channel
[09:42.640 --> 09:49.040]  fox cnn msnbc cnbc they will not mention ron paul even when he's number one or number two or
[09:49.040 --> 09:54.000]  number three they will they will show the poll numbers on screen but then not even mention him
[09:54.000 --> 10:01.200]  or say he can't win and hey bring me some of that uh sarah paleon literature we hope she runs but
[10:01.200 --> 10:08.080]  don't bring me any ron paul stuff ha ha ha like everybody knows you know don't buy that carton
[10:08.080 --> 10:14.960]  eggs it's rotten don't buy that gallant of milk it's rotten uh i mean they are treating you like you
[10:14.960 --> 10:20.560]  are flotsam and jetsam that just goes with the wind and well if they tell you then you're not
[10:20.560 --> 10:26.880]  going to go for ron paul but ron paul's got a new tv ad out that i think is absolutely genius
[10:26.880 --> 10:31.840]  because it simply states the truth when you got the truth you don't need to remember what you're
[10:31.840 --> 10:36.800]  going to say you just state the facts when you've got the truth you just lay your cards on the table
[10:36.800 --> 10:44.640]  and win every time and the new ad ron paul's new ad uh the one who can beat obama uh is the headline
[10:44.640 --> 10:51.440]  it's at info wars dot com and prison planet dot com so that is coming up now on the economic front
[10:51.440 --> 10:57.840]  and paul watson's written articles about this you can pull up the quotes where top bill berg
[10:57.840 --> 11:03.680]  group members top founders of the euro uh across the board have all written books and made statements
[11:03.680 --> 11:10.400]  that the euro was meant to destroy the sovereignty not unify the nations for greater political power
[11:10.400 --> 11:16.720]  and for easier mobility and commerce across borders which would be one thing it was meant
[11:16.720 --> 11:21.840]  to destroy sovereignty and transfer it to the unelected bureaucracy that's now happened
[11:22.480 --> 11:27.520]  and as soon as countries enter the euro they are instantly imploded financially i e ireland
[11:27.520 --> 11:33.200]  greece great examples within just six months of entering the euro they went from the success story
[11:33.200 --> 11:38.800]  in ireland to oh you're totally bankrupt because they signed on to the debt of the private banks
[11:38.800 --> 11:45.600]  in that deal and they admit that the euro is a receivership arm and is a financial agreement
[11:45.600 --> 11:51.760]  through the private central banks to sign over your sovereignty and so now that they've had multiple
[11:51.760 --> 11:58.240]  banker bailouts in europe which is just basically government taxes paid to their banker masters
[11:58.240 --> 12:04.320]  that have taken over their nations through fraud that after they've had multiple bailouts now
[12:04.320 --> 12:10.960]  germany and france are saying okay we're setting up a total financial union that will rule everyone
[12:10.960 --> 12:17.040]  and raise everybody's taxes to pay the central banks and you've got all the big private banking
[12:17.040 --> 12:22.960]  families the rothschilds the rockefellers warren buffett bill gates all the elite families
[12:22.960 --> 12:28.560]  are on every tv channel every newspaper wall street journal new york times saying time to
[12:28.560 --> 12:34.720]  raise taxes time to raise taxes we've got to help the poor but see they have exempted themselves
[12:34.720 --> 12:44.320]  with the irish double and and other financial systems that they've set up where they are exempt
[12:44.320 --> 12:51.200]  from almost all of the taxes then they double back con the public using social engineering
[12:52.400 --> 12:58.960]  class warfare class envy garbage and say hey if somebody's making 125,000 a year they're rich
[12:58.960 --> 13:03.680]  we're going to tax them and get the economy going hey if somebody's making a quarter million
[13:03.680 --> 13:08.320]  same proposals in europe we're going to raise their taxes if it's a couple making a quarter million
[13:09.040 --> 13:15.680]  and it's on and so this is how the double irish system as it's known where they've written the
[13:15.680 --> 13:21.520]  tax laws in europe in the u.s and canada where they are exempt but you are not if you try let's say
[13:21.520 --> 13:28.320]  you're a millionaire if you try to go set up a tax shelter via the double irish or other systems
[13:28.320 --> 13:34.080]  you will be instantly swat teamed instantly arrested and it doesn't matter if you go into the
[13:34.080 --> 13:39.120]  special courts the special irs courts they have they have similar ones in europe with the fact
[13:39.120 --> 13:44.320]  that it's a law and that you're allowed to do it they will selectively go after you and claim
[13:44.320 --> 13:54.240]  that it's fraud only the mega rich are exempt from taxation that's how this works so we're
[13:54.240 --> 14:00.080]  going to be going over uh that report today in fact here it is in the daily mail paris and
[14:00.080 --> 14:07.280]  berlin launch a coup to control eurozone demanding rights to dictate economic policy to the countries
[14:07.280 --> 14:14.160]  they've now taken over uh here's mpr france germany proposed true european economic government
[14:14.160 --> 14:20.080]  let's see an economic government government for and by the crony bankers the monopoly men
[14:20.080 --> 14:28.720]  and this is the crux the heart of every issue and there was only one man in 25 year history
[14:28.720 --> 14:34.320]  in congress or 12 terms he was in for one term as a libertarian the system ran him out and now
[14:34.320 --> 14:40.000]  he's come back for 11 more terms he's of course in the middle of his 11th uh term as a republican
[14:41.200 --> 14:46.720]  congressman ron paul and he was talking about the fellow reserve when it wasn't cool
[14:46.720 --> 14:51.120]  he was talking about it when the southern poverty law center and adl would claim it was
[14:51.120 --> 14:57.920]  codewords for being a racist uh i mean they would throw the kitchen sink at you if you tried to
[14:57.920 --> 15:04.800]  talk about these issues and now because the people of america liberal conservative libertarian
[15:04.800 --> 15:10.800]  across the board polls two years ago 75 wanted to audit or abolish the fed now it's over 85
[15:10.800 --> 15:17.680]  percent because the people as the big brzezinski said last year were finally awake to the real
[15:17.680 --> 15:23.600]  power structure not the obamas not the bushes not the murkals not the burrosos not the gordon
[15:23.600 --> 15:30.560]  browns not the front puppets not the marionettes but the puppet masters themselves the system is
[15:30.560 --> 15:36.800]  in deep trouble because once you identify that wait a minute i pay my rs check and then it's
[15:36.800 --> 15:42.720]  deposited with the private federal reserve what you mean we didn't have an income tax until 1913
[15:42.720 --> 15:48.640]  and until 1951 90 plus percent of americas were exempt you mean we built this country and had 10
[15:48.640 --> 15:54.320]  percent growth rates annually on average before we got this in place you mean the good time started
[15:54.320 --> 16:01.360]  to end when they took over you mean you mean they're private it's over it's over it's the
[16:01.360 --> 16:07.760]  beginning of the end for them unless they stage terror attacks and bring a police state into place
[16:08.320 --> 16:14.480]  and to illustrate the fact that our ideas are winning are dominating remember 10 years ago i
[16:14.480 --> 16:18.880]  didn't tell you we were winning i didn't tell you three and a half years ago that ron paul was
[16:18.880 --> 16:23.840]  unstoppable uh if we simply believed in him i said he was an underdog but he was educating people
[16:23.840 --> 16:31.280]  and could win this time he is the leader he has emerged even as ap admitted as shaping the election
[16:31.280 --> 16:39.520]  and dominating it and being the main frontrunner okay this is incredibly positive news but the
[16:39.520 --> 16:44.480]  controllers didn't take over the planet because they're shy or because they're weak or because
[16:44.480 --> 16:49.760]  they're not bold or because they're not duplicitous and deceptive and murderous and absolutely
[16:49.760 --> 16:56.560]  totally ruthless they are in control because they understand human psychology they understand
[16:56.560 --> 17:02.480]  economics and they are going to strike back with everything they've got and the number one thing
[17:02.480 --> 17:07.440]  they're going to do and i saw this in their manuals and their internal documents three years ago
[17:07.440 --> 17:11.920]  we broke the myok homeless courier reports and others here many reports before that
[17:11.920 --> 17:19.280]  we saw the attack pattern we basically were able to reverse engineer the enemy propaganda attack
[17:19.280 --> 17:24.080]  pattern and it's very elementary but it works on people that are not awake and not aware of the
[17:24.080 --> 17:31.120]  trick once you know the trick you can't believe that you didn't see it before and it's called stage
[17:31.120 --> 17:37.680]  terror attack it's called stage terror attack and now in the last few months they've publicly rolled
[17:37.680 --> 17:43.680]  it out the tea party or terrorists they're going to blow stuff up uh the fbis watching people that
[17:43.680 --> 17:50.080]  protest the fed the army standing by to guard it this is all come out in the news now uh again we
[17:50.080 --> 17:55.040]  call it the fed the private fellow reserve again the name itself is a deception everything is deception
[17:55.040 --> 18:02.080]  with these people and they are preparing and they are beta testing and trial ballooning right now
[18:02.080 --> 18:08.880]  to see if you will buy it now they don't like the tea party or uh getting in the face of obama
[18:08.880 --> 18:12.800]  a few days ago and saying why'd you call us terrorist and then you can hear his question
[18:12.800 --> 18:20.240]  obama's mumbling answers about well uh you know what biden meant was uh but but the point is they
[18:20.240 --> 18:25.840]  are really pushing this and there's all these white house advisors and others saying this is
[18:25.840 --> 18:31.760]  what's needed so that audio clip is coming up uh also monday we had the article krugman of the
[18:31.760 --> 18:37.840]  new york times calls on government to manufacture war to save economy amidst alien invasion rant
[18:37.840 --> 18:43.920]  many missed the point that new york times economist was advocating a staged crisis
[18:44.960 --> 18:50.960]  that's exactly what robert supero writing in the financial times of london said he said barring
[18:50.960 --> 18:57.040]  a new oklahoma city or 9 11 there is no way obama is going to get reelected in no way his
[18:57.040 --> 19:02.720]  his agenda is going to be put through remember that was a year ago now he said that now we've
[19:02.720 --> 19:09.520]  seen other advisors come out and we've seen uh internal democratic party operative uh letters
[19:09.520 --> 19:15.760]  going out to their big donors saying the right is going to stage a new oklahoma city and this

[24:09.680 --> 24:14.960]  so quietly in the last decade the public's been told that we're giving up all of our liberties
[24:14.960 --> 24:22.320]  and setting up a domestic internal secret police force under homeland security because of al-qaeda
[24:23.680 --> 24:28.640]  despite the fact that al-qaeda was set up by the u.s. government in 1979 and has been protected
[24:28.640 --> 24:32.640]  and financed doesn't matter if the underwear bomber on christmas day two years ago was
[24:32.640 --> 24:39.520]  gotten on the plane by the u.s. government and the um deputy secretary of state had to admit that
[24:39.520 --> 24:45.520]  that doesn't matter if amour al-a-laki number three in al-qaeda fox news even admits dines
[24:45.520 --> 24:52.160]  secretly at the pentagon no that's the public sales job for all these wars it's just an
[24:52.160 --> 24:59.040]  extension of lying about wmds and saddam was going to nuke uh england in 45 minutes and uh
[24:59.040 --> 25:04.080]  colon pal holding up the anthrax that turned out to be a government operation all the evidence showed
[25:04.080 --> 25:12.560]  no quietly they've been training the police the military that it's conservatives it's libertarians
[25:12.560 --> 25:17.600]  it's constitutionalist it's people that don't like the giant out of control private
[25:17.600 --> 25:23.280]  federal reserve banking system dominating the country but now in the last year i've seen the
[25:23.280 --> 25:29.440]  political establishment advising obama that if you don't have a new oklahoma city or 911 to blame
[25:29.440 --> 25:34.960]  the tea party your political career is over and there's new reports out where they're basically
[25:34.960 --> 25:40.480]  calling for the stage crisis a war obama saying he's not worried about al-qaeda he's worried about
[25:40.480 --> 25:48.480]  lone wolf domestic groups and remember about a month ago a homeland security put out all these
[25:48.480 --> 25:55.840]  new psas where almost everyone in it is a white person and if you've got a cell phone if you're
[25:55.840 --> 26:01.840]  wearing a hoodie you're a terrorist it it it's rebranding that that the the tea party is going
[26:01.840 --> 26:09.840]  to get you and then you see the vice president two weeks ago come out and say the tea party
[26:09.840 --> 26:16.560]  or terrorist and that they may blow something up so you see the major rollout the major frame up
[26:17.280 --> 26:21.280]  being prepared but the establishment isn't stopping there
[26:21.280 --> 26:28.720]  they are ignoring ron paul demonizing him when they do covering i mean saying he can't win when
[26:28.720 --> 26:33.680]  he is clearly the front runner when he isn't a flip-flopper when he understands the inflation
[26:33.680 --> 26:39.680]  tax he understands were dominated by international private banks that launder most the drug money
[26:39.680 --> 26:47.360]  on record bloomberg locovia wells fargo 376 billion laundered and drug money in two years nobody got
[26:47.360 --> 26:52.240]  in trouble ron paul understands this so it's not enough to demonize people that criticize the
[26:52.240 --> 26:57.520]  fellow reserve and criticize the private banking cartel they are also going to hit it from another
[26:57.520 --> 27:04.720]  angle by co-opting it attack it but also co-opt it when ron paul comes out and calls the private
[27:04.720 --> 27:09.840]  fellow reserve treacherous and treasonous it gets ignored when rick perry algore's former chief of
[27:09.840 --> 27:18.160]  staff in texas mr carbon tax mr gun control when mr napis super highway mr forced garter cell
[27:18.160 --> 27:29.840]  inoculation when he comes out and talks about it the media gives it total and complete attention
[27:30.480 --> 27:37.760]  and here's our article on it perry apes ron paul an attack on fed cartel here's another one ap
[27:37.760 --> 27:44.240]  whitehouse denounces that's roiders actually whitehouse denounces perry as republicans target fed
[27:44.240 --> 27:49.280]  i mean before five years ago if you talk about the fellow reserve every mainline politician both
[27:49.280 --> 27:54.160]  parties would absolutely excoriate you as a conspiracy theorist remember that if you even
[27:54.160 --> 27:59.120]  said the fed was private they would laugh at you they would say oh next martians are going to get
[27:59.120 --> 28:05.120]  me remember that then they stopped denying it was private and defended it now they're saying yeah
[28:05.120 --> 28:09.760]  they're almost treasonous they're treacherous and the and the president comes out and says
[28:09.760 --> 28:16.880]  how dare you perry say we shouldn't print more money well it is a treacherous act to kill the
[28:16.880 --> 28:21.520]  dollar it is a treacherous act by the banking cartel but they're ending the dollar they're
[28:21.520 --> 28:28.720]  moving on to the global s dr based out of europe that the e u is now openly calling for as the
[28:28.720 --> 28:34.080]  solution to the same banking cartel imploding their countries some people email me and say
[28:34.080 --> 28:39.680]  why are you bashing europe saying it's taking over america no no no no no the same money laundering
[28:39.680 --> 28:45.360]  drug dealing mega banks on record are the ones imploding europe and imploding our country as
[28:45.360 --> 28:52.240]  well we're all in this together the same mega banks that have bankrupted nigeria and argentina
[28:52.240 --> 28:59.360]  it's the same stratagem of economic hitmen so continuing whitehouse denounces perry as republicans
[28:59.360 --> 29:04.640]  target fed the white house denounced republican presidential candidate rick perry today for
[29:04.640 --> 29:09.600]  his threatening remarks towards the head of the us federal reserve and represented some of the most
[29:09.600 --> 29:15.200]  inflammatory rhetoric in the 2012 election campaign and they go on to say that it's absolutely
[29:15.200 --> 29:19.600]  terrible that they're doing it printing more money to play politics this particular time in
[29:19.600 --> 29:25.520]  american history is almost treacherous treasonous in my opinion perry said but see they're so desperate
[29:25.520 --> 29:32.400]  that ron paul's catching up they're gonna allow their minions perry and palanche excuse me uh
[29:32.400 --> 29:38.240]  bachman has now also come out with anti-fed rhetoric so is newt genrich the admitted globalist
[29:39.600 --> 29:44.080]  you got herman kane up there he used to work for the federal reserve he's even starting to come out
[29:44.080 --> 29:49.680]  because they have to hear it as bachman also takes aim at fed reuters rick perry versus ben

[33:22.480 --> 33:31.200]  all right alex jones here back live on this wednesday the 17th day of august 2011
[33:33.120 --> 33:38.160]  and the private banking cartel that controls the european union is also dominating the united
[33:38.160 --> 33:45.120]  states is openly announcing a complete private receivership takeover of europe the very same
[33:45.120 --> 33:51.120]  institutions that our federal reserve represents are doing the same thing here in the united states
[33:51.120 --> 33:57.120]  we're going to be breaking that down i would love to get your take as listeners on all the news
[33:57.120 --> 34:02.640]  we've been covering in the last 33 minutes the toll free number to join us today is 800
[34:02.640 --> 34:12.960]  25 at 992 31 800 25 at 992 31 also yesterday we covered the la times headline dealing with the
[34:12.960 --> 34:20.080]  atf supervisors that went ahead with the fast and furious program to ship guns into mexico to
[34:20.080 --> 34:28.560]  destabilize mexico demonize the second amendment here domestically and fund the sinaloa cartel to
[34:28.560 --> 34:34.480]  help knock out their competition that's also admitted in the el paso times in another report
[34:34.480 --> 34:41.120]  that came out yesterday this is such incredible information and it's just hidden in plain view
[34:41.120 --> 34:48.880]  and now the justice department has promoted the atf supervisors that carried out this operation
[34:48.880 --> 34:56.320]  and is busy demoting and threatening the agents that blew the whistle on this corruption so just
[34:56.320 --> 35:04.400]  unbelievable information now coming out in the open showing how government will stage crises
[35:04.400 --> 35:12.960]  as a pretext to consolidate control over society now continuing we have several video clips i want
[35:12.960 --> 35:21.280]  to play here the first one is a new ps a that has been put out uh by homeland security and now
[35:21.280 --> 35:26.240]  remember a month ago it got national attention when the drudge report and others linked to our
[35:26.240 --> 35:31.760]  info wars dot com report showing the training manuals and the videos where they're rebranding
[35:31.760 --> 35:40.000]  the terror threat from al qaeda al ciata uh over to anyone that doesn't like the federal reserve
[35:40.000 --> 35:46.960]  anyone that doesn't like the global government anyone that uh is uh criticizing the establishment
[35:46.960 --> 35:52.560]  but this message has become so mainstream that ron paul is winning in all the major polls
[35:52.560 --> 35:57.680]  that now they're trying to co-op the movement from another angle with rick perry and of course
[35:57.680 --> 36:03.440]  michelle bachman coming out and saying yes the federal reserve is treacherous almost treasonous
[36:03.440 --> 36:11.120]  so they're hitting it from both angles but here's the newest report uh put out by paul joseph
[36:11.680 --> 36:19.520]  watson today it just went live at info wars dot com and prison planet dot com big sis latest
[36:19.520 --> 36:27.440]  terrorist uh more white americans new dhs video ignores previous controversy over deliberate
[36:28.400 --> 36:32.720]  racial overtones where all the terrorists in the video are white and everybody reporting
[36:32.720 --> 36:38.000]  them as a quote minority again they've already sold whites you know using a little tinge of racism
[36:38.720 --> 36:44.400]  that hey uh you know we're only taking the brown people's rights well now they're telling the brown
[36:44.400 --> 36:48.880]  folks hey now we're gonna take the white people's uh rights well they're actually taking everyone's
[36:48.880 --> 36:55.120]  liberties and everyone's freedoms just like hitler first uh put dr conan laws into place
[36:55.120 --> 37:00.400]  but only enforced them against unpopular minorities later expanded to everyone in the rike
[37:00.400 --> 37:06.560]  despite causing controversy last month with a video that portrayed white middle class americans
[37:06.560 --> 37:11.760]  as the most likely terrorist the department of homeland security has released yet another psa
[37:11.760 --> 37:19.600]  that depicts an attempt to bomb a subway station not an al-qaeda muslims but well-dressed white people
[37:19.600 --> 37:24.480]  again what do the internal manuals say is it a priest don't trust him just because he's a priest
[37:24.480 --> 37:29.040]  or a woman with a baby carriage may be a terrorist are they wearing blue jeans do they have a cell
[37:29.040 --> 37:34.400]  phone it's so wide it's meant to make everybody not trust each other it hypes up a threat you
[37:34.400 --> 37:39.360]  got a better chance of being killed by a honey bee sting than by terrorist and it sells this total
[37:39.360 --> 37:46.320]  surveillance takeover of society and the federalization of police a new public service announcement
[37:46.320 --> 37:51.920]  entitled the drop-off if you see something say something was unveiled by none other than big
[37:51.920 --> 37:57.840]  sis herself janet napolitano on the homeland security website today america and the rest of
[37:57.840 --> 38:03.760]  the world is going into a depression i went to the mall last week with my children uh barton
[38:03.760 --> 38:10.880]  creek mall i only go a few times a year and it did totally transformed police everywhere uh when you
[38:10.880 --> 38:16.720]  buy something you're interrogated your id is taken and gone over your ask questions you know is this

[38:22.960 --> 38:28.400]  looking at them going yes uh the same thing in every store i went in all these weird security
[38:28.400 --> 38:34.480]  guards everywhere with these giant cartoon sized police hats bugging their eyes out of everybody
[38:35.040 --> 38:40.400]  the truth is we're going into a depression and they're using the terror threat as a pretext
[38:40.400 --> 38:49.760]  to get this police state grid rolled out uh continuing uh here uh with the information
[38:49.760 --> 38:55.120]  the psa which will be played on television radio station shows a well-dressed attractive white woman
[38:55.120 --> 38:59.440]  exiting a taxi before walking into a subway station the taxi driver a white man then takes
[38:59.440 --> 39:05.440]  a cell phone call and sets a timer on the device in the trunk of a car the woman then leaves her bag
[39:05.440 --> 39:11.040]  in the station if you see something say something report suspicious activity local authority states
[39:11.040 --> 39:17.600]  the voiceover as the clip ends with commuters reporting the incident to a black security guard
[39:17.600 --> 39:22.880]  and a black police officer it's the same there's scores of these psas and they're all the same
[39:22.880 --> 39:29.280]  whites are the terrorist blacks hispanics muslims they're the good guys the white people are everywhere
[39:29.280 --> 39:34.320]  they're a savage force coming to kill you now in previous videos it would show some brown people
[39:34.320 --> 39:40.480]  some white people as terrorist and then whites and blacks reporting them now it's white people are
[39:40.480 --> 39:45.600]  terrorist they're going to get you and again what does the vice president say the tea party
[39:45.600 --> 39:49.760]  who they say is predominantly white they're the terrorist well who's the president worried about
[39:49.760 --> 39:55.600]  with wolf blitzer yesterday the white people the evil terrorist they're going to get you the evil
[39:55.600 --> 40:00.000]  tea party and again they've already branded the tea party as white it's not completely white but
[40:00.000 --> 40:05.360]  they're trying to make it racial if you're against the obama health carrier racist they're injecting
[40:05.360 --> 40:13.520]  the race over and over and over again and it's absolutely textbook uh division divide and conquer
[40:13.520 --> 40:19.440]  in her accompanying statement on the video dhs chief napolitano also hints that gun stores could
[40:19.440 --> 40:24.160]  be a prime breeding ground for terrorist which again they now are restricting the second amendment
[40:24.160 --> 40:30.480]  outside of law can't pass the law the atf who's shipping the guns to mexico comes into four western
[40:30.480 --> 40:35.680]  states on the border southwestern states and says we've got to start restricting how many guns you
[40:35.680 --> 40:42.560]  can buy even if we don't have a law so she's connecting it to guns so now terrorism isn't
[40:42.560 --> 40:48.720]  just evil tea party people it's guns guns are connected to terror dhs chief napolitano also
[40:48.720 --> 40:53.280]  hints that gun stores could be a prime breeding ground for terrorists making reference to a recent
[40:53.280 --> 40:58.080]  case where the gun owner of a store in ford hood called authorities or an individual in the store
[40:58.080 --> 41:02.240]  was behaving in a suspicious manner turns out that whole thing stinks to high heaven and looks
[41:02.240 --> 41:08.720]  like it's staged as we highlighted last month a longer psa recently produced by dhs overwhelmingly
[41:08.720 --> 41:14.240]  went to significant links to portray white americans including showing white people's eyes glowing
[41:14.240 --> 41:21.920]  blue as the most likely terrorist despite the fact that 126 people who were indicted on terrorist
[41:21.920 --> 41:27.760]  related charges in the united states over the last two years were all muslim bizarrely the majority
[41:27.760 --> 41:34.320]  of the people shown reporting suspicious activity to authorities were portrayed as non whites and
[41:34.320 --> 41:40.240]  the article goes on to break all of this down it was one of the biggest stories in the country a
[41:40.240 --> 41:45.440]  month ago when we put the report out i don't normally ask drudge to link to our reports but
[41:45.440 --> 41:53.680]  if drudge is listening or if the other crew over there mr curl is listening it'd be great if they
[41:53.680 --> 42:00.880]  got this out but regardless ladies and gentlemen get this report send it to everyone you know
[42:00.880 --> 42:06.880]  because a year ago i said they're rebranding terror from al-qaeda over to anybody that opposes
[42:07.600 --> 42:15.280]  the the banking takeover and predominantly that's the tea party and now it's mainstreamed to understand
[42:15.280 --> 42:21.440]  were dominated by offshore banking cartel headed up by goldman sacks jp morgan bank of america
[42:21.440 --> 42:27.200]  wells fargo again those are all multinational operations city group bank of england they're
[42:27.200 --> 42:34.960]  all private and the federal reserve is their holding company it is now absolutely essential
[42:34.960 --> 42:40.240]  to understand that robert Shapiro put out memos to the white house saying barring in fact pull
[42:40.240 --> 42:46.960]  up the financial times of london for me um the headlines like how does obama stay relevant
[42:46.960 --> 42:50.720]  but if you just type in you can find our article that links to it if you type in um
[42:50.720 --> 42:57.600]  um clinton advisor says obama needs terror and then i want to actually read the exact quote to
[42:57.600 --> 43:02.400]  people instead of just paraphrasing it but we'll see how accurate my paraphrase is while they pull
[43:02.400 --> 43:10.320]  it up uh it was um the only hope the president has of getting re-election and of uh being popular
[43:10.320 --> 43:15.760]  with the public is to have a new oklahoma city or 9-11 event so he can look strong and look like
[43:15.760 --> 43:20.880]  he can protect the people and then you saw other current white house advisors say
[43:23.760 --> 43:28.720]  absolutely obama faces growing credibility crisis was the article pull it up for me please and i'll
[43:29.680 --> 43:35.920]  i'll actually read the quote for people but but again and and and and watson in his article in
[43:35.920 --> 43:43.760]  fact i should just read the rest of the article um in the rest of his article he actually does link
[43:43.760 --> 43:52.240]  to those um very very very very important information and so it is absolutely essential
[43:53.280 --> 44:02.400]  that we get this info out to everyone right now it is so important i mean if you thought i was
[44:02.400 --> 44:08.000]  going out in the limb a year and a half ago begging mainline conservative talk show host
[44:08.000 --> 44:13.440]  to go public with this and a lot of them did michael savage blend back and others did listen to me
[44:13.440 --> 44:17.360]  and i appreciate that because they saw the facts limbaugh better talk about this
[44:18.000 --> 44:24.880]  everybody better talk sean hannity the ringleader of establishment neocondom listen listen
[44:25.520 --> 44:30.640]  just because you've posed as conservatives to lead us down a rat hole the system is now
[44:30.640 --> 44:36.480]  going to betray you like hitler and his knight of the long knives going after his own minions first
[44:36.480 --> 44:43.520]  the brown shirts the globalist want to discredit anybody who is for sovereignty anybody who's
[44:43.520 --> 44:49.040]  for low taxes because the bankers are going into their austerity phase of total control
[44:51.760 --> 44:56.320]  okay here's the quote from the financial times of london obama faces growing credibility crisis
[44:56.320 --> 45:00.800]  the bottom line here is that americans don't believe in president obama's leadership says
[45:00.800 --> 45:06.960]  rob Shapiro another former clinton official and supporter of obama who advises him he said
[45:06.960 --> 45:12.320]  he has to find some way between now and november that's the election coming up of demonstrating
[45:12.320 --> 45:18.400]  that he is a leader who can command confidence and short of a 9 11 event or an oklahoma city
[45:18.400 --> 45:27.920]  bombing i can't think of how he could do just that now let me pull up uh this next clip
[45:27.920 --> 45:35.360]  krugman krugman but no no no first we've got to play that the new dhs uh piece here so first
[45:35.360 --> 45:41.600]  we'll play this dhs new 30 second promo uh and they're all the same every whites a terrorist
[45:41.600 --> 45:46.640]  every person with brown skin is good it's like nazi germany reversed i was against demonizing
[45:46.640 --> 45:50.800]  muslims when we wrote these articles a month ago people said well why are you saying don't
[45:50.800 --> 45:56.160]  demonize whites i'm against seeing black people you know an ad where all the terrorists are blacks
[45:56.160 --> 46:03.040]  and and the good guys are whites i was against stereotyping muslims as terrorists whoever the
[46:03.040 --> 46:08.240]  establishment wants to go after if they want to invade your country they're gonna stage terror and
[46:08.240 --> 46:14.160]  say your country did it like iraq or blame you for somebody else's terror like iraq now the banks
[46:14.160 --> 46:19.760]  want to take over the west they're going to provocateur and stage terror and and and blame it
[46:19.760 --> 46:25.200]  on people that's major branding it's a hundred percent fact that they're moving from beta testing
[46:25.200 --> 46:32.480]  to actually going live with this we could be days or weeks away our our exposing this is one of the
[46:32.480 --> 46:36.320]  only things that's held them back you don't think they're freaked out by glenn bett coming out saying
[46:36.320 --> 46:41.760]  the obama administrations getting ready to stage a new oklahoma city he said that on fox and a couple
[46:41.760 --> 46:48.640]  weeks later that he announced that he was leaving okay this is life and death this is not a game
[46:49.600 --> 46:53.840]  all you people that that wanted to buy into the fake terror threat because it was fun to hate muslims
[46:53.840 --> 46:57.440]  and get scared of them you're now going to have this whole system turned around on you
[46:57.440 --> 47:02.720]  it's already been turned around years ago behind closed doors against anybody that's for decency
[47:02.720 --> 47:09.840]  and and and and a constitutional republic now here's the new piece it's not as powerful on radio
[47:09.840 --> 47:14.800]  but you can watch the video at info wars dot com but a prison planet dot tv viewers can see this
[47:14.800 --> 47:17.680]  big sis latest terrorist more white americans here it is
[47:17.680 --> 47:24.080]  this commuter station evil white woman look at
[47:28.880 --> 47:35.040]  maybe you see something suspicious but you don't want to get involved it's nothing you think
[47:36.320 --> 47:46.560]  can you be sure can you be sure if you see something say something report suspicious activity to
[47:46.560 --> 47:55.760]  local authorities like like you don't uh know that for yourself and and now i've been in an airport
[47:56.480 --> 48:04.960]  and set my bag under the table while i'm eating something one of those little cafes
[48:05.920 --> 48:10.000]  that are out under the rotunda and i'll go over get some napkins and i see people oh
[48:10.000 --> 48:14.160]  oh my gosh that guy just walked ten feet away to get napkins they're training us how to live
[48:14.160 --> 48:19.200]  like prisoners in a giant jailhouse but meanwhile i've tried to call homeland security i tried to call
[48:19.200 --> 48:25.920]  the local austin police says your homeland security referred me to to say um i have witnesses that
[48:25.920 --> 48:30.480]  saw the u.s government get the underwear bomber on the plane he was drugged and they said we're
[48:30.480 --> 48:34.000]  not going to take your report and then of course later it did come out because of pressure that
[48:34.000 --> 48:40.160]  yeah the u.s government did get him on the plane an unnamed us age agency us intelligence agency
[48:40.160 --> 48:48.480]  uh asked uh the state department to get him on the plane detroit free press under secretary of
[48:51.840 --> 48:53.280]  state kennedy
[48:56.000 --> 49:01.840]  so this is what we're dealing with here and they're not going to stop now the next clip i want to go
[49:01.840 --> 49:10.720]  to is krugman in the new york times he basically gave a slightly veiled coded message uh on national
[49:10.720 --> 49:17.200]  television on cnn with the big bill berg group breed zarkaria program krugman calls on government
[49:17.200 --> 49:23.520]  to manufacture war to save economy and then he spends it as an alien invasion ran and people
[49:23.520 --> 49:28.400]  didn't get what this meant he meant a new war an outside threat a terror threat when they talk about
[49:28.400 --> 49:32.080]  alien attacks that's code for state's care let's go ahead and play part of that club as we got to
[49:32.080 --> 49:37.040]  break here it is think about world war two right that was not that was actually negative social
[49:37.040 --> 49:41.120]  product spending and yet it brought us out i mean partly because you want to put these things together
[49:41.120 --> 49:45.920]  if we say look we could use some inflation ken and i are both saying that which is of course
[49:45.920 --> 49:51.600]  anathema to a lot of people in in in washington but is in fact what the basic logic says it's very
[49:51.600 --> 49:56.400]  hard to get inflation in a depressed economy but if you had a program of government spending plus
[49:56.400 --> 50:00.720]  an expansionary policy by the fed you could get that so if you think about using all of these
[50:00.720 --> 50:07.280]  things together you could accomplish you know a great deal i mean if we if we discovered that uh
[50:07.280 --> 50:12.000]  you know space aliens were playing to attack and we needed a massive buildup to counter the space
[50:12.000 --> 50:18.240]  alien threat um and really inflation and budget deficits took secondary uh place to that um
[50:18.880 --> 50:23.520]  this slump would be over in 18 months and then if we discovered whoops we made a mistake there
[50:23.520 --> 50:27.200]  aren't actually any so we need art and we'd be better what you're saying no that's right that's
[50:27.200 --> 50:31.920]  uh there was a twilight zone episode like this which uh scientists fake us an alien threat in
[50:31.920 --> 50:35.280]  order to achieve world peace well this kind we don't need it we need in order to get some fiscal
[50:35.280 --> 50:39.600]  stimulus uh but no i mean the point is but ken but ken wouldn't agree with that right the space
[50:39.600 --> 50:44.640]  aliens wouldn't work clear that right i think it's not so clear that kens was right i mean
[50:44.640 --> 50:50.960]  there's been so there's a debate about that about we need a unifying event because in that episode
[50:50.960 --> 50:54.960]  the government does stage the alien threat it turns out that's project blue beam that is a
[50:54.960 --> 51:01.040]  declassified uh partially declassified us government plan so they're openly talking about it we all

[54:16.080 --> 54:19.120]  declaring independence
[54:19.120 --> 54:25.680]  Ray McGovern's on in the last 30 minutes today coming up in the third hour former top CIA analyst
[54:26.240 --> 54:31.680]  to Ronald Reagan and George Herbert Walker Bush talking about the global crisis the buildup to
[54:31.680 --> 54:37.600]  a ground invasion of Libya his view of Rick Perry saying that anybody involved in the Gaza
[54:37.600 --> 54:42.960]  flotilla should be charged for simply being part of an aid mission will also get his take on fast
[54:42.960 --> 54:49.520]  and furious that false flag attack against the second amendment to demonize it i've got a bunch
[54:49.520 --> 54:54.800]  of other clips and at the very start of the show i played Obama saying that the new threat
[54:55.680 --> 55:00.640]  is not al-qaeda but lone wolf terrorist basically agreeing with biden saying the tea
[55:00.640 --> 55:06.080]  party or terrorist this is the rollout of that but they're so threatened by patriots and people
[55:06.080 --> 55:10.880]  that are aware of the globalist that again they're going to hit it from multiple angles
[55:10.880 --> 55:14.240]  they're going to attack it and say that we're terrorists and stage events
[55:14.240 --> 55:17.120]  that's now pretty much a certainty unless we completely get the word out
[55:18.400 --> 55:23.120]  and when they do stage an event you've got to go directly to it because you've got to go towards
[55:23.120 --> 55:27.520]  the danger if they stage something god forbid here in austin i'm going to go directly towards it
[55:28.160 --> 55:33.280]  so that i can document and get that key evidence right after it happens that's what's so important
[55:33.280 --> 55:37.840]  to catch them if it happens in other areas of the country the world you've got to get there you've
[55:37.840 --> 55:43.520]  got to videotape but you've got to talk to witnesses immediately before the official lie is put out
[55:44.240 --> 55:45.920]  we've got to get that intel up front
[55:48.720 --> 55:53.440]  but i've broken all of this down i've i've warned you now you can see the rollout
[55:53.440 --> 55:57.760]  in full view but they're not only attacking it saying if you're against globalism if you're
[55:57.760 --> 56:01.440]  against losing sovereignty if you're against being debt slaves if you're against a police
[56:01.440 --> 56:06.400]  state you're a terrorist and and connecting political activity in a peaceful protest in

[1:01:55.920 --> 1:02:02.080]  hi how are you good thanks for listening thanks thanks for taking my call i was
[1:02:02.080 --> 1:02:09.440]  wanting to find out if anybody else of the viewers um last week on the debate i uh watched it and of
[1:02:09.440 --> 1:02:13.840]  course i thought ron paul did excellent well i couldn't sleep that night about two thirty
[1:02:13.840 --> 1:02:19.440]  that morning i um went on fox news to see how they he was doing because they had a poll
[1:02:20.000 --> 1:02:25.200]  saying you know who do you think won the debate so i of course voted for ron paul and it showed
[1:02:25.200 --> 1:02:32.560]  that he was 60 had over 68 percent of the votes and everybody else were in single digits so i went
[1:02:32.560 --> 1:02:36.960]  finally went to sleep thinking you know well this will show them and i got up the next morning
[1:02:36.960 --> 1:02:42.400]  they didn't mention them on tv yeah they had 30 000 votes and changed we posted the numbers
[1:02:42.400 --> 1:02:49.200]  and he won 16 000 plus more than half and fox pulled the poll uh even politico reported on that
[1:02:49.200 --> 1:02:57.120]  uh fox uh pulled the poll uh la times also reported on it so did the san francisco chronicle
[1:02:57.120 --> 1:03:02.080]  fox pulled the poll and uh did not report on their own poll because he he got more than
[1:03:02.080 --> 1:03:07.200]  all the other candidates combined they didn't like that it made me so mad i emailed every
[1:03:07.200 --> 1:03:12.400]  single person on that show and told them you know you claim to be fair and balanced and i wrote
[1:03:12.400 --> 1:03:18.080]  saying shame on you to all of them but well see again they're the fake conservative opposition
[1:03:18.080 --> 1:03:23.280]  meant to control and steer real constitutionalistic conservatives libertarians and so that's why
[1:03:23.280 --> 1:03:27.920]  they said ron paul can't win he's nothing oops he keeps winning the polls oops he got more votes
[1:03:27.920 --> 1:03:32.160]  than everybody else combined oops everybody was giving him standing ovations oops he lost by
[1:03:32.720 --> 1:03:37.040]  you know less than one percent against bachman even though she bought 90 plus percent of her
[1:03:37.040 --> 1:03:43.600]  votes at the straw poll she bought 4 000 she got 4 600 something votes she bought 4 000
[1:03:43.600 --> 1:03:51.600]  let's say it again she bought 4 000 plus votes she got less than 6 600 total that were actually
[1:03:51.600 --> 1:03:56.640]  hers ron paul won that too he's winning everything he's the front runner they're completely freaked
[1:03:56.640 --> 1:04:03.200]  out they're pulling out all the stops but it blew up in their face and now i was saying because it's
[1:04:03.200 --> 1:04:08.640]  backfiring because the people who really didn't maybe not know who ron paul was see that he's
[1:04:08.640 --> 1:04:13.440]  being slighted so then now they're going to look him up and find out well who is he and what is
[1:04:13.440 --> 1:04:19.520]  he represent so you know what what they're meaning for evil god's turning to good in my opinion so
[1:04:19.520 --> 1:04:23.600]  absolutely and even if even if they steal the election steal the primaries and ron paul doesn't
[1:04:23.600 --> 1:04:30.400]  win he's going to be there for the next year uh injecting real issues into the debate the
[1:04:30.400 --> 1:04:35.280]  campaign and building the awakening and the and the solidarity we're the majority look at how
[1:04:35.280 --> 1:04:39.760]  he's winning that's an illustration of that but this helps us come together and lets us know our
[1:04:39.760 --> 1:04:45.120]  power that's why i challenged him here on air and behind the scenes both times he's run for
[1:04:45.120 --> 1:04:50.000]  president in the last four years i said ron you've got to run because regardless you're going to have
[1:04:50.000 --> 1:04:54.240]  a bully pulpin he said you're right and of course i knew he was going to run long before he announced
[1:04:54.240 --> 1:05:01.840]  it but i never tell tales until they're public we'll be right back this is alex jones with five
[1:05:01.840 --> 1:05:07.040]  good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation

[1:05:22.880 --> 1:05:28.480]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[1:05:28.480 --> 1:05:33.680]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[1:05:33.680 --> 1:05:38.320]  families lose their power from weather-related onages number five a solar power generator

[1:08:43.920 --> 1:08:50.880]  department has put out another video if there was any doubt that they are selling the new terrorist
[1:08:50.880 --> 1:08:57.840]  brand as white people and as tea party members it is all over we've seen the vice president other
[1:08:57.840 --> 1:09:03.200]  big democrats come out and say the tea party or terrorist they're going to get violent we've seen
[1:09:03.200 --> 1:09:08.480]  chris mathews now suddenly pushing it at nauseam and putting out special tv reports
[1:09:08.480 --> 1:09:14.720]  like the rise of the new right where he implies that myself and ron paul basically want violence
[1:09:14.720 --> 1:09:23.440]  with with no evidence we have seen countless other corporate media productions pushing this we have
[1:09:23.440 --> 1:09:31.360]  seen now these homeland security training videos and the training manuals that federal marshals
[1:09:31.360 --> 1:09:36.080]  state police and others have sent us we're behind the scenes the entire threat that they're training
[1:09:36.080 --> 1:09:41.600]  the police the military for is gun owners returning veterans conservatives libertarians people that
[1:09:41.600 --> 1:09:46.000]  want to audit the private federal reserve people that want to get rid of the federal reserve system
[1:09:46.000 --> 1:09:51.520]  because we are the real opposition and so they don't want hispanics blacks and others feeling
[1:09:51.520 --> 1:09:56.400]  like they're americans and they're part of sovereignty so they brand it that it's a white
[1:09:56.400 --> 1:10:00.960]  thing to be against the federal reserve it's it's a white thing to want to be in the tea party
[1:10:00.960 --> 1:10:09.360]  and not only is it a whitey thing it's a terrorist thing and now they have a new video out it's posted
[1:10:09.360 --> 1:10:18.720]  at info wars.com in the article by paul joseph watson and you also see obama coming out now
[1:10:19.840 --> 1:10:28.000]  and saying that again his main threat is a lone lone terrorist telling wolf blitzer that last
[1:10:28.000 --> 1:10:34.640]  night you can see that the branding is going into high gear and if you go to info wars.com
[1:10:34.640 --> 1:10:39.680]  and if you put it back on screen i'll read it to folks thank you big sis latest terrorist more
[1:10:39.680 --> 1:10:47.040]  white americans this is such a big deal this is so huge if you were doubting my predictions of
[1:10:47.040 --> 1:10:51.200]  years ago if you were doubting my predictions of months ago if you were doubting that this is
[1:10:51.200 --> 1:10:59.840]  going to happen they are definitely going to stage terror attacks or provocateur terror attacks
[1:10:59.840 --> 1:11:05.520]  by funding mentally ill people bare minimum as a pretext to demonize anyone that criticizes
[1:11:05.520 --> 1:11:11.920]  the private federal reserve and if i had to guess a target they'll hit like i did before 9-11
[1:11:11.920 --> 1:11:16.400]  signal probably blow up the world trade center complex and blame it on their asset bin laden
[1:11:16.400 --> 1:11:23.200]  if i had to pick a target it would be something like the federal reserve but a federal reserve
[1:11:23.200 --> 1:11:29.600]  that has a daycare in it uh the globalist the bankers will want to bomb kids and then they'll
[1:11:29.600 --> 1:11:34.240]  have photographers when the firemen run out with bleeding children to get those photos
[1:11:34.960 --> 1:11:39.600]  just like operation gladio in europe where the u.s government with nato admittedly staged more
[1:11:39.600 --> 1:11:44.720]  than 200 bombings in germany idly you name it to blame it on their political opposition
[1:11:45.360 --> 1:11:51.680]  a true left-wing movement was rising in europe in the 70s and 80s so they had to stage terror
[1:11:51.680 --> 1:11:57.040]  attacks blowing up school buses and other things to blame it on them when right-wing groups that
[1:11:57.040 --> 1:12:01.360]  aren't controlled by the banker start rising they'll stage attacks and blame it on them
[1:12:01.360 --> 1:12:07.360]  this is the oldest trick in the book problem reaction solution and so we've got to get this
[1:12:07.360 --> 1:12:12.880]  new report out because they put out a whole group of videos a month ago where every terrorist is a
[1:12:12.880 --> 1:12:19.280]  white person every person that reports them as a quote minority with dark skin the new video
[1:12:19.280 --> 1:12:26.960]  it is the same story um they see a white terrorist and the black police uh are called in to stop
[1:12:26.960 --> 1:12:33.760]  them uh so this is absolutely incredible and it only confirms that they're that the train left
[1:12:33.760 --> 1:12:38.880]  the station and it's about to arrive at its destination destination false flag terror to
[1:12:38.880 --> 1:12:44.240]  fully flip what's already been flipped behind the scenes from al-qaeda muslim threat to the
[1:12:44.240 --> 1:12:50.160]  domestic threat and you see obama saying it's now a domestic threat it's a lone wolf and they're
[1:12:50.160 --> 1:12:56.240]  also going to stage some attacks that are muslim as well uh and then brand the two together to make
[1:12:56.240 --> 1:13:01.760]  them synonymous with one another i've tried to warn people as best i can people do know about
[1:13:01.760 --> 1:13:09.360]  false flag terror inside job now self-inflicted wound staged frame ups but we've really got
[1:13:09.360 --> 1:13:14.960]  to get the word out to an even greater level now so people are watchful of it if you see something
[1:13:14.960 --> 1:13:19.600]  say something but you've got to say it to the media you've got to say it yourself you've got to say
[1:13:19.600 --> 1:13:25.120]  it on youtube you've got to say it in a place where you can't be censored uh if you see the feds
[1:13:25.120 --> 1:13:29.920]  doing suspicious things or you see contractors doing suspicious things if you actually call
[1:13:29.920 --> 1:13:34.640]  the local threat fusion center they're not going to respond just like the feds ran a drill the week
[1:13:34.640 --> 1:13:41.840]  of 9 11 with tripod 2 as the cover of what they were doing and then that drill came out and uh the
[1:13:41.840 --> 1:13:46.480]  mayor first said yes we had a drill then later said no we didn't have a drill and then it turned
[1:13:46.480 --> 1:13:51.840]  out he had been lying he was part of the drill of the world trade centers being blown up that's right
[1:13:51.840 --> 1:13:59.040]  a drill of the world trade centers being blown up being destroyed the day it happened that's so if
[1:13:59.040 --> 1:14:05.440]  good cops or good fbi catch the contractors in there getting ready to blow it oh it's part of the
[1:14:05.440 --> 1:14:12.160]  drill what happened when the fsb got caught in 1999 planting bombs in a fourth apartment building
[1:14:12.160 --> 1:14:18.400]  three have been blown up in the suburbs of moscow to blame it on the chetchins what did the fsb then
[1:14:18.400 --> 1:14:27.120]  report the fsb said oh we were just running a drill when they got caught in there planting the bombs
[1:14:27.120 --> 1:14:33.040]  local police caught them and they said it's just a drill even though the hexagon explosives were real
[1:14:33.040 --> 1:14:38.240]  that's why they run the drills they fund the terror attack through the drill they bootleg it
[1:14:38.240 --> 1:14:45.280]  then if they get caught or if nsa systems pick up chatter then they say oh that's only part of the
[1:14:45.280 --> 1:14:51.760]  drill also the overall chatter is a smoke screen so that other agencies can't discover what's happened
[1:14:51.760 --> 1:14:56.560]  all right i said i'd go to your calls and i'm ranting here i want to get into ron paul uh
[1:14:56.560 --> 1:15:03.360]  though before i go to your calls uh here are the headlines perry apes ron paul an attack on fed
[1:15:03.360 --> 1:15:09.520]  cartel uh here's another one of roiders white house denounces perry as republicans target fed
[1:15:09.520 --> 1:15:16.560]  newt genrich bachman perry all now trying to become ron paul while simultaneously attacking him
[1:15:16.560 --> 1:15:21.920]  because he has never compromised he's always voted as he said he would vote he's always
[1:15:21.920 --> 1:15:26.080]  voted for the constitution he really will try to get rid of the federal reserve he will try to
[1:15:26.080 --> 1:15:31.120]  restore sound money and take the money power back under congress not the private federal reserve so
[1:15:31.120 --> 1:15:42.640]  he is anathema to them he is cyanide to these devils continuing rolling stone rick perry versus
[1:15:42.640 --> 1:15:50.000]  ben bernacky round one so they're really hyping this up bachman also takes aim at federal reserve
[1:15:50.000 --> 1:15:55.280]  michelle bachman took aim at the federal reserve tuesday after rival candidate rick perry caused a
[1:15:55.280 --> 1:16:00.880]  storm with a his fierce criticism of fed chairman ben bernacky i've been fighting on that issue
[1:16:00.880 --> 1:16:06.640]  since i came to congress bachman told reporters after stump speech to about 300 people at a drive-in
[1:16:06.640 --> 1:16:12.480]  restaurant in south carolina the federal reserve is not subject to transparency the federal reserve
[1:16:12.480 --> 1:16:16.640]  is made terrible grievous errors no they've they've helped consolidate power for the megabanks have
[1:16:16.640 --> 1:16:20.560]  done a great job the government doesn't screw up when they get caught shipping cocaine in or
[1:16:20.560 --> 1:16:26.320]  guns into mexico they're doing what they're told that's why they get rewarded and promoted but
[1:16:26.320 --> 1:16:31.680]  if you expose the government drug dealing you get shot in the face like serpicoe uh or you get
[1:16:31.680 --> 1:16:38.240]  demoted she said criticizing the central bank's quantitative easing programs of buying government
[1:16:38.240 --> 1:16:44.080]  bonds to lower interest rates and boost the economy and she goes on to criticize the federal reserve
[1:16:44.080 --> 1:16:50.720]  show the point is ron paul is dominating as the ap had to admit on monday that he's now
[1:16:50.720 --> 1:16:56.800]  dominating the debate and is the frontrunner in the republican field of eight different people
[1:16:57.680 --> 1:17:03.360]  he is dominating he is winning the straw polls are coming in second he is winning the scientific
[1:17:03.360 --> 1:17:08.320]  polls are coming in second he's winning winning winning so what do they tell you he can't win he

[1:24:16.880 --> 1:24:19.440]  Alan and Denmark you're on the air thanks for holding
[1:24:20.880 --> 1:24:24.720]  hello Alexander the great how are you doing good my friend what's on your mind
[1:24:24.720 --> 1:24:31.120]  I have two points to talk with you about one is border protection in Denmark
[1:24:32.880 --> 1:24:39.280]  here a week ago we have a lot of problems from brucell we're not allowed to have this border
[1:24:39.280 --> 1:24:45.920]  protection we're basically not allowed to protect our borders so we had a lot of problems with
[1:24:45.920 --> 1:24:53.920]  engines from Eastern Europe coming here and stealing copper and criminal stuff you know yes I've seen
[1:24:53.920 --> 1:24:58.480]  the reports that's what's really shaking the euro up is that Eastern Europe is completely in a
[1:24:58.480 --> 1:25:04.880]  depression Europe is in a deep deep recession and then I have seen the reports that a lot of
[1:25:04.880 --> 1:25:10.640]  countries are wanting to put up their borders again but the euro is saying no you joined us
[1:25:10.640 --> 1:25:18.160]  you're not allowed to and so there's huge crime sprees yeah so our politicians are basically
[1:25:18.160 --> 1:25:25.920]  speaking about getting out of the Lisbon treaty yes and right as Europe as countries start moving
[1:25:25.920 --> 1:25:30.480]  to get out of the Lisbon treaty which created the euro what do you think of Merkel and the
[1:25:30.480 --> 1:25:36.160]  Sarkozy announcing they're going to expand a financial euro whether you like it or not and
[1:25:36.160 --> 1:25:46.080]  literally destroy your sovereignty it's already happening Alex I'm sad to say it is so by the
[1:25:46.080 --> 1:25:50.240]  way folks that's not my opinion I've got three mainstream headlines saying the same thing
[1:25:50.240 --> 1:25:56.000]  here's the Daily Mail Paris and Berlin launch a coup to control eurozone demanding right to
[1:25:56.000 --> 1:26:02.240]  dictate economic policy over the countries so the end of sovereignty where Napoleon and Hitler
[1:26:02.240 --> 1:26:10.400]  failed to dominate Europe they're succeeding through financial stealth yes it's it's it's
[1:26:10.400 --> 1:26:15.280]  very sad but what can you do as a single person well are folks starting to wake up
[1:26:17.520 --> 1:26:25.440]  yes the young people are but but not the old people the old people are still in the old media
[1:26:25.440 --> 1:26:33.040]  stuff you know and they don't listen to your kind of stuff you know so well it's up to you
[1:26:33.040 --> 1:26:37.920]  Alan and Denmark to spread the word god bless and good to hear from you let's go ahead now
[1:26:37.920 --> 1:26:45.360]  and take another call let's talk to John in Wyoming John you're on the air hi Alex I've got a couple
[1:26:45.360 --> 1:26:51.120]  of quick things to bring out what you were talking about how the media's ignoring Ron Paul is true
[1:26:51.120 --> 1:26:57.920]  but it's not new go back to 1972 when George Wallace was trying to get nominated by the Democratic
[1:26:57.920 --> 1:27:05.840]  Party for the presidency he won the Florida primary overwhelmingly and that night the NBC
[1:27:05.840 --> 1:27:12.320]  nightly news had a special that was hosted by their left-wing bobblehead Frank McGee and he
[1:27:12.320 --> 1:27:18.320]  spent the first 28 minutes of the 30 minute program telling you how well the number two three four
[1:27:18.320 --> 1:27:24.640]  five and six candidates did and at the very end of the program oh and by the way George Wallace
[1:27:24.640 --> 1:27:32.400]  won the primary no yeah that's the way they operate now another thing let me urge all of your listeners
[1:27:32.960 --> 1:27:43.520]  to either call up Fox News at 1-888-369-4762 and leave them a nasty message or email them a
[1:27:43.520 --> 1:27:50.000]  nasty message every time that CFR bobblehead Charles Krauthammer gets on Brett Baer's program
[1:27:50.000 --> 1:27:57.760]  and keeps repeating that CFR slogan oh Ron Paul can't win Ron Paul can't win when he knows otherwise
[1:27:58.400 --> 1:28:04.640]  and ask them demand that they be fair and balanced that whatever happened to their policy of being
[1:28:04.640 --> 1:28:11.040]  fair and balanced and that I left them a message stating that since when is it the province of
[1:28:11.040 --> 1:28:16.800]  Charles Krauthammer to dictate how Americans are going to vote why don't you let the American people
[1:28:16.800 --> 1:28:23.360]  decide the issue we don't need Charles Krauthammer to telling us to tell us who can win and who can't
[1:28:23.360 --> 1:28:30.640]  win because Krauthammer is just a stooge for the CFR you can look him up he is a member of the CFR
[1:28:31.280 --> 1:28:36.240]  and he is one of their talking bobbleheads trying to convince people that Ron Paul doesn't have a
[1:28:36.240 --> 1:28:41.680]  chance when in fact he does have a chance of people will only show a little courage and vote for the
[1:28:41.680 --> 1:28:49.920]  man and don't worry about the talking bobbleheads from the CFR well again and and in the case of
[1:28:49.920 --> 1:28:56.320]  the establishment being scared of George Wallace who certainly know Ron Paul the individual that
[1:28:56.320 --> 1:29:02.560]  shot him if you look at that whole story it's the classic staged you know drugged up you know
[1:29:02.560 --> 1:29:09.200]  lunatic who'd been in government hands and then the staging of the diary years later being found
[1:29:09.200 --> 1:29:14.240]  to the supposed shooter I don't think they're going to shoot Ron Paul even if he starts winning
[1:29:14.240 --> 1:29:18.560]  because they realize that would only turn him into an even bigger martyr but we all need to be
[1:29:18.560 --> 1:29:23.760]  praying for Ron Paul because I've never seen a system so scared of him I mean have you ever seen
[1:29:23.760 --> 1:29:29.200]  anything like this no I never have Alex but I think they will try to do something to either
[1:29:29.200 --> 1:29:36.000]  humiliate him as they try to do with Ron Paul or they will try to arrange for a convenient
[1:29:36.000 --> 1:29:41.360]  little accident well they already had Barat try to jump on him sexually and luckily Ron Paul threw
[1:29:41.360 --> 1:29:45.200]  him off of him and got out of there they'll probably say he's kidnapped women like I said
[1:29:45.200 --> 1:29:49.360]  Ran or he worships Buddha no kidding and they're gonna throw the sink at him well they're right

[1:42:40.240 --> 1:42:46.320]  for guns program i know all over they've got programs to buy back guns which the police admit
[1:42:46.320 --> 1:42:52.320]  creates the image of people lined up turning in guns ahead of real gun confiscation right yeah now
[1:42:52.320 --> 1:42:57.600]  you see these billboards you know here in orlando that in big bold letters it says turn in your guns
[1:42:57.600 --> 1:43:02.240]  no questions asked and i looked it up online because it was kind of vague i didn't even know what the
[1:43:02.240 --> 1:43:07.280]  billboard was about and yeah it turns out you can turn in your unwanted guns and you get a gift card
[1:43:07.280 --> 1:43:10.800]  you know so you can turn in your weapons and you get you know something to put you into the
[1:43:10.800 --> 1:43:16.240]  fiat money well it's the idea of turn in your guns it's like all over the country they have ads
[1:43:16.240 --> 1:43:20.880]  11 percent of texans now have warrants out for them total police state 11 certain texans

[1:44:40.880 --> 1:44:46.160]  now learn isn't just doing it out of gun shops uh actually there in florida the atf has been
[1:44:46.160 --> 1:44:50.320]  shipping them to the drug gangs because they're the drug gangs going after the other drug gang
[1:44:50.320 --> 1:44:55.760]  that didn't launder their money with them that the government is drug dealing child kidnapping

[1:47:57.920 --> 1:48:06.800]  of the water but it's good i mean you cannot make it up i wish i was a liar i wish it wasn't true
[1:48:06.800 --> 1:48:13.200]  every minute i love my children i love this country but we have such incredible psychopaths running
[1:48:13.200 --> 1:48:22.400]  things again it's very positive how much folks have woken up they've shown that they're ready to
[1:48:22.400 --> 1:48:27.680]  fully wake up but it's going to take some real gut checks to get out of denial toll free number
[1:48:27.680 --> 1:48:37.360]  to join us 800 259 92 31 800 259 92 31 we have henry in california listing on xm channel 166
[1:48:37.360 --> 1:48:42.880]  henry thanks for holding her on the air hi alex i'm wondering um if you can help me out with
[1:48:42.880 --> 1:48:49.280]  something personal um i was in the air force uh back when the minor air force space that didn't
[1:48:49.280 --> 1:48:55.680]  happen and uh oh and they shipped to what three nukes down to louisiana now see that's the thing
[1:48:55.680 --> 1:49:00.720]  alex i'm not sure if you've ever seen that film uh waltz with this year how they describe have you
[1:49:00.720 --> 1:49:08.000]  ever seen that film uh what film is that waltz with this year i don't believe some oh you should see
[1:49:08.000 --> 1:49:14.720]  that that's a film about uh israeli in conflict but uh he goes into describe how uh the individual
[1:49:14.720 --> 1:49:20.720]  soldier you know is really stuck in the fog of war and like can't really i because it really
[1:49:20.720 --> 1:49:25.680]  gets a whole bunch of the soldiers who were at minot and saw the weird nukes being stolen
[1:49:25.680 --> 1:49:30.560]  they're probably gonna try to blame it on iraq or something uh those cruise missiles a lot of
[1:49:30.560 --> 1:49:35.120]  people died who who witnessed that but i'm gonna stop interrupting you were getting off into a
[1:49:35.120 --> 1:49:41.280]  movie but first you say you want to get my advice about something at minot the missing nukes uh yeah
[1:49:41.280 --> 1:49:46.640]  just because um i was trying to um you know it's kind of like my personal thing now i was
[1:49:46.640 --> 1:49:50.880]  you know there when they had to stand down day and um it's it's really hard for me to talk about
[1:49:50.880 --> 1:49:55.600]  i'm getting kind of choked up and so then if you could give me uh any information you see what i'm
[1:49:55.600 --> 1:50:00.320]  saying from the individual's perspective it's very difficult to understand just what was happening
[1:50:00.320 --> 1:50:05.680]  because all i remember was just you know craziness i remember trying to tune into you you know the
[1:50:05.680 --> 1:50:10.320]  internet had you blocked you know on the basis of course people were actively saying you know
[1:50:10.320 --> 1:50:17.360]  this seems real suspicious and you were just bringing up uh the planned uh attacks see what
[1:50:17.360 --> 1:50:22.080]  i'm saying from you know the outer space alien you know what what would be worse than cruise missiles
[1:50:23.840 --> 1:50:28.080]  well that's right again the cnn calling singing be great to have aliens attack because that would
[1:50:28.080 --> 1:50:32.640]  unify us but we'd have to stage it and then all these other advisors saying we need terror attacks
[1:50:32.640 --> 1:50:37.040]  like we're idiots and don't see them all over the news saying terror attacks will help obama
[1:50:37.040 --> 1:50:42.240]  and then obama comes out and says the tea party's about to blow stuff up tell them biden that's right
[1:50:42.240 --> 1:50:46.480]  i mean it's a hundred percent scripting like we're idiots they talk to us like we're unconscious
[1:50:46.480 --> 1:50:52.480]  morons because a large portion of the population is in a mind numb stupor but but i'm gonna come back
[1:50:52.480 --> 1:51:00.320]  to you henry uh listening on xm channel 166 i want to hear from you about what you saw that day

[1:53:01.040 --> 1:53:06.080]  hear are the real experiences of women over 40 who finally lost weight by becoming hormonally
[1:53:06.080 --> 1:53:14.480]  balanced again i lost 20 pounds i lost 40 pounds i lost 55 pounds i went from a size 14 to a size
[1:53:14.480 --> 1:53:21.040]  eight their secret is amber and the revolutionary formula for women over 40 that balances hormones
[1:53:21.040 --> 1:53:26.480]  naturally the leading cause of weight gain over 40 is hormonal imbalance until you balance your
[1:53:26.480 --> 1:53:32.080]  hormones losing weight can be practically impossible but amberin restores hormonal balance
[1:53:32.080 --> 1:53:38.160]  naturally so the weight can just fall right off even that stubborn belly fat plus amberin eliminates

[1:53:57.040 --> 1:54:23.920]  1-800-737-9107 i want to say something here very slowly and very simply for new listeners
[1:54:23.920 --> 1:54:29.920]  if you've studied history you know anytime you build an extremely powerful government
[1:54:30.800 --> 1:54:39.360]  even if good people built it who were misguided it will be taken over by corrupt individuals
[1:54:39.360 --> 1:54:44.240]  they will seek to get control of it because that is the ultimate power on this planet
[1:54:44.880 --> 1:54:51.200]  to wage war to steal money to shut down your competition that's why tyranny is the norm all
[1:54:51.200 --> 1:54:56.240]  over the world that's why third world countries that have more resources in the us live in squalor
[1:54:56.240 --> 1:55:02.720]  because the military just takes over or an oligarchy financed by megabanks takes over
[1:55:03.520 --> 1:55:08.960]  and that's the end of it and that's the end of your society and there is a military industrial
[1:55:08.960 --> 1:55:14.240]  complex total police state takeover that has happened and it was built ahead of the design
[1:55:14.240 --> 1:55:19.440]  collapse of america and now they've scripted that americans that don't want to be slaves or terrorist
[1:55:19.440 --> 1:55:23.600]  see the government wouldn't have the moral high ground because it's illegitimate and run by foreign
[1:55:23.600 --> 1:55:28.000]  banks if it just came in here and said we're taking over we're raising your taxes because
[1:55:28.000 --> 1:55:33.520]  we pay it to foreign banks that put us in power and we're going to shoot you if you fight back
[1:55:33.520 --> 1:55:38.160]  the cops in the military would say we're not going along with that but if they nuke chicago
[1:55:38.160 --> 1:55:44.480]  and say that a tea party military person got a nuke and did it your neighbor will probably come
[1:55:44.480 --> 1:55:50.560]  over and try to lynch you they'll be all emotional they'll buy into seeing it in fox they'll be in
[1:55:50.560 --> 1:55:56.480]  a big pity party and they're going to come after you if obama nuke's the city even mainline
[1:55:56.480 --> 1:56:01.440]  conservatives will start worshiping him you will see this they will start worshiping him and calling
[1:56:01.440 --> 1:56:05.840]  for their neighbors to be torn to shreds they will say i'm not part of the tea party now
[1:56:05.840 --> 1:56:11.600]  had just approved themselves they'll go over and gun down their neighbor who's got an american flag
[1:56:11.600 --> 1:56:16.320]  you're here with the terrorist they could wrap a nuke in an american flag and nuke chicago and
[1:56:16.320 --> 1:56:21.680]  americans would pull down american flags and and desecrated and and and would and would burn effigies
[1:56:21.680 --> 1:56:28.880]  of george washington give the media said george washington nuked you people that support george
[1:56:28.880 --> 1:56:34.320]  washington nuke chicago they would pull down george washington's image and stomp it in the street
[1:56:34.320 --> 1:56:39.840]  i'm not joking because americans have been trained to act like children it's fun to get upset and
[1:56:39.840 --> 1:56:46.800]  fun to be conned and and fun to be suckers and let me tell all you suckers up front who are new
[1:56:46.800 --> 1:56:53.280]  listeners the new world order is going to destroy you okay if you don't wake up and stop sucking
[1:56:53.280 --> 1:56:57.440]  your thumbs now finishing up with henry in california then we'll get to james woody
[1:56:57.440 --> 1:57:03.760]  curt chris and others tell us what you saw it might not uh there in the dakotas at the nuke base
[1:57:03.760 --> 1:57:07.520]  because this is admitted the three nukes came up missing and it was impossible that that could
[1:57:07.520 --> 1:57:12.160]  have happened and somebody was trying to divert them uh i mean what happened that day on the base
[1:57:12.960 --> 1:57:19.920]  you know uh alex i think you misunderstood me i was the only i was not at my not i was uh
[1:57:19.920 --> 1:57:24.640]  in air combat command uh strategic air command okay but still those are the folks over the
[1:57:24.640 --> 1:57:29.200]  nukes so what did you witness um well the thing is is that i remembered that there was something
[1:57:29.200 --> 1:57:34.480]  called solid curtain citadel shield going on is that is that correct because alex you know i'm
[1:57:34.480 --> 1:57:38.960]  really just like i was just really one of the like of the low guys that was like an airman airman
[1:57:38.960 --> 1:57:43.200]  you know what i mean i understand yeah there were a bunch of drills going on continuum and
[1:57:43.760 --> 1:57:49.120]  everything was locked down all the time and now here's the thing you know they told us this was
[1:57:49.120 --> 1:57:55.040]  like one of the world's you know like premier things that would ever happen this has never
[1:57:55.040 --> 1:57:59.520]  happened you know it's like you see a comet you know that hyperbolic comet that's coming in
[1:57:59.520 --> 1:58:03.760]  it's like you're gonna see this once and never happen again that wasn't just like a broken arrow
[1:58:03.760 --> 1:58:09.040]  it was like a bent arrow you know where they claim to lose the missiles and then they sent
[1:58:09.040 --> 1:58:15.520]  us all out on this this like namby pamby safety check you know but i mean we're talking about
[1:58:15.520 --> 1:58:21.840]  missing nuclear warheads and that's the um the thing is that the uh anniversary is coming up
[1:58:21.840 --> 1:58:26.320]  pretty soon so that's why i was just wondering if you happen to know anything uh that that would
[1:58:26.320 --> 1:58:31.440]  happen well yeah i mean the intel on that was chaney tried to steal those nukes and then people
[1:58:31.440 --> 1:58:35.360]  blew the whistle in the military so they had to kill a bunch of people there were a bunch of death so
[1:58:36.000 --> 1:58:40.160]  they they need to get those nukes going off so we learn how to worship the tyrants it's real simple
[1:58:42.320 --> 1:58:48.160]  you are listening to gcn visit gcnlive.com today
[1:58:52.000 --> 1:58:58.080]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this is our last chance to not
[1:58:58.080 --> 1:59:03.200]  relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath
[1:59:03.200 --> 1:59:09.360]  americans at home i have turned members influence on our president in congress and they really are
[1:59:09.360 --> 1:59:15.680]  calling the shots i think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay attention
[1:59:15.680 --> 1:59:21.840]  for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on
[1:59:21.840 --> 1:59:28.080]  destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government tim geithner bernanke and arsonists
[1:59:28.080 --> 1:59:32.560]  they're asking for more matches and the congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today
[1:59:32.560 --> 1:59:39.360]  seems like nobody does care and right now in washington dc we have seen a fall of the republic

[2:00:14.080 --> 2:00:21.840]  alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[2:00:25.840 --> 2:00:30.560]  hey did you know that the printer cartridge ain't used in most printers i know it
[2:00:32.320 --> 2:00:35.760]  and i'm too weak-minded to get rid of our old printers and not have bisphenol a
[2:00:36.640 --> 2:00:43.680]  ink even though the associated press reported that just two or three exposures to this massively
[2:00:43.680 --> 2:00:49.440]  lowers male fertility and i'm so weak-minded and so conditioned because humans are designed
[2:00:49.440 --> 2:00:54.960]  to accept their environment and adapt to it that uh i haven't even gotten rid of the bisphenol a
[2:00:54.960 --> 2:00:59.600]  that we print all these articles on so we have a hard copy of them i just sit here all day and
[2:00:59.600 --> 2:01:06.160]  even sometimes lay my sandwich on them during the break and just eat it and um hadn't destroyed my
[2:01:06.160 --> 2:01:10.640]  fertility but it admittedly does damage people's fertility in fact folks won't believe that we put
[2:01:10.640 --> 2:01:18.240]  uh uh bisphenol a uh in printer receipts lowers fertility i'm going to show folks that right over
[2:01:18.240 --> 2:01:24.160]  here i've got my a cell phone that attracts me and radiates me and i warn everybody about them and
[2:01:24.160 --> 2:01:29.280]  then they're so handy and so useful i still basically kill myself with it the point is i'm a
[2:01:29.280 --> 2:01:35.200]  hypocrite we're all hypocrites and we better just realize this has all been designed to slowly kill
[2:01:35.200 --> 2:01:41.600]  us it's all part of the eugenics program there it is daily science science daily bpa lowers male
[2:01:41.600 --> 2:01:46.800]  fertility mouse study finds and it's in most receipts and printer ink just just thought i'd throw
[2:01:46.800 --> 2:01:52.720]  that little little little jiblet out at you uh because you know that's the top of stuff i think
[2:01:52.720 --> 2:01:57.440]  about i'm going why don't i get rid of the bisphenol a printer ink i know it's twice as much to not
[2:01:57.440 --> 2:02:04.000]  have it i gotta buy new printers why do i not go tell my office manager to do that well i only use
[2:02:04.000 --> 2:02:10.080]  the cell phone about 10 15 minutes a day i do i i don't use it a lot because i know it's killing me
[2:02:10.080 --> 2:02:15.680]  um but it is tracking me and i but i know it's really handy and i use it to fight the globalist
[2:02:15.680 --> 2:02:20.560]  and but but still i shouldn't have wireless in my house well i've gotten rid of wireless in my house
[2:02:21.600 --> 2:02:25.840]  okay what else can i do i should get rid of wireless in the office you know we've just
[2:02:25.840 --> 2:02:32.640]  got to do it see they they they introduce all this stuff into our lives we accept it we habitualize
[2:02:32.640 --> 2:02:36.880]  it we create a habit and then we just go along with it and they're just giving us the habit that
[2:02:36.880 --> 2:02:42.560]  it's normal to have tsa grabbing our genitals and environmental enforcers coming in and inspecting
[2:02:42.560 --> 2:02:47.760]  our houses and all the rest of it i mean we're just being broken we're being broken together and
[2:02:47.760 --> 2:02:52.400]  i'm tired of it and we're starting to wake up the giants trying to get up and the lila pulleys that
[2:02:52.400 --> 2:02:57.040]  run our government are trying to keep us tied down it's time to turbo charge and wake up and take
[2:02:57.040 --> 2:03:05.120]  action uh let's go ahead and uh talk to woody uh in washington thanks for holding so long woody
[2:03:05.120 --> 2:03:09.680]  i think you got lost there in the list go ahead yeah how you doing alec good sir
[2:03:10.560 --> 2:03:15.200]  yeah it's a pleasure to talk to you i just want to tell you i've been i have uh uh
[2:03:15.200 --> 2:03:20.400]  a son who's in the military and and he's been in since uh old two and just think for a lot of
[2:03:20.400 --> 2:03:24.720]  the military families right now we're looking at the possibility here of escalating into a
[2:03:24.720 --> 2:03:33.200]  third world war and doing it through libya and uh i think uh selente is right on his analysis uh
[2:03:33.200 --> 2:03:36.320]  they're going to do what they've always done they're going to follow their playbook and they're
[2:03:36.320 --> 2:03:40.560]  going to take us right in the world war three and the american people need to start a week
[2:03:40.560 --> 2:03:43.840]  awakening to that fact and support ron paul for president
[2:03:46.320 --> 2:03:51.280]  well i think you're right and uh you know the word is they are planning in late september
[2:03:51.280 --> 2:03:55.760]  early october to announce the ground force in libya they keep trying the hoax of qaddafi's left
[2:03:55.760 --> 2:04:01.520]  qaddafi's dead qaddafi went to venezuela qaddafi will fall in two days will be in libya for two days
[2:04:02.720 --> 2:04:09.680]  and the word is from our sources that have been very accurate um and now nato's admitted it that
[2:04:09.680 --> 2:04:14.400]  if qaddafi doesn't fall or doesn't leave they are planning a ground force but it's not a war though
[2:04:15.280 --> 2:04:20.960]  okay it's not a war sir that's kinetic action i understand yeah exactly don't be an
[2:04:20.960 --> 2:04:26.320]  extremist come on yeah i know a bit to be extreme today is to talk reality and and to know what
[2:04:26.320 --> 2:04:31.120]  your eyes are telling you is the truth not what these talking morons on the tube are telling

[2:09:13.360 --> 2:09:20.000]  the air welcome and thanks for holding well alex i wanted to uh thank ron paul and bloomberg news
[2:09:20.000 --> 2:09:26.560]  for going after the fed and and to become even more hardcore as uh as the spear gets even sharper
[2:09:27.200 --> 2:09:33.760]  regarding the fed and uh call for indictments for ben bernanke and the former inspector general
[2:09:33.760 --> 2:09:39.440]  livid colman for lying on intensifying a congress for per their committing perjury and saying they
[2:09:39.440 --> 2:09:44.400]  don't know where the money went where the federal reserve gave these emergency bailouts to as we
[2:09:44.400 --> 2:09:52.160]  know uh digital i 21st gao ought to reveal this in the two and a half year period uh 16.1 trillion
[2:09:52.160 --> 2:09:58.080]  to foreign banks corporations and countries and uh domestic as well as you know and uh that's just
[2:09:58.080 --> 2:10:05.120]  in the two and a half year period from december 2007 to february 2010 um and um pardon me december
[2:10:05.120 --> 2:10:11.760]  2007 to july 2010 but uh then you know bailing out the illubian government's own bank uh air
[2:10:11.760 --> 2:10:17.920]  banking corps as you'd probably know for 26 billion dollars 46 low interest emergency loans
[2:10:18.480 --> 2:10:23.200]  and uh you know causing all the problems with their member banks um laundering money for the
[2:10:23.200 --> 2:10:29.520]  mexican drug cartels we have a lot to uh have the other candidates speak out again again well
[2:10:29.520 --> 2:10:35.760]  exactly you're not hearing rick perry talk about fast and furious and how it was a false flag stage
[2:10:35.760 --> 2:10:40.960]  terror attack against the second amendment and to destabilize mexico or that guns were shipped
[2:10:40.960 --> 2:10:46.400]  into other areas of the u.s not just mexico or the attorney general's been caught uh perjuring
[2:10:46.400 --> 2:10:51.360]  himself to congress i mean obama should be impeached right now if rick perry and michelle
[2:10:51.360 --> 2:10:55.920]  bachman were real they'd be bringing it up ron paul has brought it up ron paul has brought up
[2:10:55.920 --> 2:11:00.480]  government drug dealing ron paul has said the federal reserve is criminal and it's come out
[2:11:00.480 --> 2:11:06.160]  in the senate committee just two months ago even the what rolling stone ran a headline to paraphrase
[2:11:06.160 --> 2:11:11.920]  that we can pull it up it's official uh banks engaged in crime where are the indictments and
[2:11:11.920 --> 2:11:17.120]  it goes over goldman sacks jp morgan senate committee said absolutely knowingly sold fraudulent
[2:11:17.120 --> 2:11:23.360]  derivatives to their customers and the government of course an s and p certified it is pure gold
[2:11:23.360 --> 2:11:29.360]  and it's now downgraded the u.s so that the banks can be paid more interest i mean it it is criminal
[2:11:29.360 --> 2:11:37.920]  look look henry polson and it continued under obama henry polson admittedly gave himself a
[2:11:37.920 --> 2:11:45.360]  200 plus million dollar payment out of bailout money to himself to himself i mean it's illegal
[2:11:45.360 --> 2:11:51.360]  it's naked all these big insurance company executives that 11 years ago signed a secret deal
[2:11:51.360 --> 2:11:56.080]  now reported on by bloomberg and others to take all the death benefits of troops as they die
[2:11:56.080 --> 2:11:59.520]  you know they pay their whole life into a death benefit into an insurance
[2:11:59.520 --> 2:12:04.320]  and the government met secretly and agreed they could steal it by sending them a form
[2:12:04.320 --> 2:12:09.280]  that says sign here and you'll get all your money and you sign the form and send it in it's a check
[2:12:09.280 --> 2:12:17.360]  and really it steals your money i mean the none of us are safe no one's safe these banks will
[2:12:17.360 --> 2:12:24.480]  destroy civilization they've even created a weird environmental post industrial religion
[2:12:24.480 --> 2:12:31.280]  to to to dress up the fact that what they do destroys civilization it's unbelievable i appreciate
[2:12:31.280 --> 2:12:36.400]  your call and again i use that term a lot unbelievable unbelievable unbelievable because
[2:12:36.400 --> 2:12:46.720]  it is unbelievable it is insane it is it is crazy that this type of stuff is going on
[2:12:46.720 --> 2:12:54.560]  let's go to bob in texas listing on k k g m 16 30 a m uh welcome bob where are you
[2:12:54.560 --> 2:12:59.280]  listening to us geographically in texas irving texas all right i knew it was in the metro
[2:12:59.280 --> 2:13:04.560]  plex but wanted to know all right sir you've got the floor go ahead can you tell me anything about
[2:13:04.560 --> 2:13:10.000]  the high number of suicides in our military particularly at fort bragg in fort hood yes
[2:13:10.000 --> 2:13:17.840]  over 300 in one year yes it's a world record for any military it's a record in the 230 year
[2:13:17.840 --> 2:13:24.080]  history of the army every branch is having it some of them are suicides because they have been
[2:13:24.080 --> 2:13:30.880]  admittedly giving them infetamin drugs after combat or after high stress on top of it they
[2:13:30.880 --> 2:13:37.680]  then give them amnesic drugs you can just look up us trips being tested on with drugs they amnesics
[2:13:37.680 --> 2:13:44.320]  then caused psychopathic breaks do you remember about five years ago uh when three members of
[2:13:44.320 --> 2:13:48.880]  delta force killed their whole families at fort bragg and when the military police pulled up in
[2:13:48.880 --> 2:13:52.400]  front of their houses they were all convulsing on the ground do you remember those stories
[2:13:53.120 --> 2:13:59.520]  no i don't well you can pull it up in the uh in the local newspaper uh and that was one unit came
[2:13:59.520 --> 2:14:05.600]  home and uh well no three of them killed their families the other one just committed suicides
[2:14:05.600 --> 2:14:10.320]  was actually four members of one unit and and later they said well it was an experimental
[2:14:11.840 --> 2:14:19.120]  drug for uh oh what's the thing that gives you uh that the mosquitoes bite you uh malaria
[2:14:19.120 --> 2:14:23.360]  so they were saying the experimental malaria drug they thought caused a psychotic break
[2:14:23.360 --> 2:14:28.560]  so it's a cocktail of things but they're not being paid enough to take care of their families
[2:14:28.560 --> 2:14:35.200]  they're having more and more stress put on them uh and they're desperate and uh that's one reason
[2:14:35.200 --> 2:14:41.760]  but also we've seen to answer your question it's a whole cocktail of things a lot of people are
[2:14:41.760 --> 2:14:48.320]  being murdered especially marine corps army navy and air force inspectors who are reporting on
[2:14:48.320 --> 2:14:55.920]  fraud and crime uh and embezzlement and contractor corruption uh there's been record numbers of them
[2:14:55.920 --> 2:15:02.000]  suiciding themselves especially in in theater yeah yeah there it is four wives slain in six
[2:15:02.000 --> 2:15:08.320]  weeks at fort bragg i don't that's cbs news i don't know if that's the uh the delta force report
[2:15:08.320 --> 2:15:13.520]  uh but that just may be another one but it's an epidemic and so that's a big reason uh so
[2:15:13.520 --> 2:15:18.880]  they're testing drugs on them including amnesics the tournament is zombies basically uh that's
[2:15:18.880 --> 2:15:23.440]  where they don't remember what they've done uh they're testing all sorts of speed drugs on them
[2:15:23.440 --> 2:15:29.280]  they're testing hormones on them uh they're total guinea pigs they're desperate they're going bankrupt
[2:15:29.280 --> 2:15:34.640]  they can't pay for their families their wives are leaving them uh their their lives are falling apart
[2:15:35.280 --> 2:15:39.600]  and they're being murdered does that answer your question that answers my question
[2:15:40.640 --> 2:15:45.280]  thank you thank you so much bob good to hear from you all right let's continue here ladies
[2:15:45.280 --> 2:15:51.120]  and gentlemen uh let's take another call from kirk in nebraska kirk you're on the air go ahead
[2:15:51.120 --> 2:15:59.360]  hey how's it going a good sir welcome uh let's take my call oxo's uh calling to tell you about
[2:15:59.360 --> 2:16:04.960]  what i saw the other night i was watching a popular show on amc it's a show called breaking bad have
[2:16:04.960 --> 2:16:10.160]  you seen it i've got to be honest with you i don't watch it but is that the one where they they put
[2:16:10.160 --> 2:16:17.360]  messages in that if you support ron paul you're a method yeah that's uh yeah it's the show where
[2:16:17.360 --> 2:16:22.320]  they took math and uh they were actually doing that they're flipping through this guy's notebook
[2:16:22.320 --> 2:16:27.360]  and uh they're flipping through they're talking about how crazy he was and you know how uh how
[2:16:27.360 --> 2:16:32.640]  much of a kooky was and you can tell when they're flipping through his notebook they flip by this
[2:16:32.640 --> 2:16:39.200]  one page and you see this uh ron paul 2012 sticker it's like a flash until it's all and again that's
[2:16:39.200 --> 2:16:44.480]  a subliminal because they know the average person isn't paying attention in that lower brainwave
[2:16:44.480 --> 2:16:48.880]  state that you go into watching television the first time it takes around an hour to go into the
[2:16:48.880 --> 2:16:55.120]  rim state uh but uh or the lower brainwave state but once you've been accustomed to it you can go
[2:16:55.120 --> 2:17:01.600]  into it in in in a matter of seconds and yes see i don't watch a lot of tv but i do have listeners
[2:17:01.600 --> 2:17:05.840]  send me short little clips of things and we did write an article about that last week air and
[2:17:05.840 --> 2:17:11.280]  dioxide so i have seen that clip and then once we posted that clip i was sent three more of past
[2:17:11.280 --> 2:17:18.640]  episodes where anytime someone does something bad they cut to ron paul in one case ron paul graffiti
[2:17:18.640 --> 2:17:23.600]  in the background that you can barely notice but your subconscious brain's about a hundred times
[2:17:23.600 --> 2:17:30.080]  more powerful than your conscience your conscious mind is just focusing in you know on one task
[2:17:30.080 --> 2:17:35.360]  and so yes this is how they do it why do you think the system is attacking ron paul from every angle
[2:17:35.360 --> 2:17:41.600]  because he can't win no because they know he's real they know that at this critical juncture
[2:17:41.600 --> 2:17:47.920]  god always gives people a way out and here's ron paul who's been fighting for 30 years right as
[2:17:47.920 --> 2:17:53.280]  everything he talked about comes true he is lined up to be the next president and so of course the
[2:17:53.280 --> 2:17:59.360]  forces of evil are pulling out the stops on him yeah and i it's crazy because i i wouldn't even
[2:17:59.360 --> 2:18:03.760]  have noticed that if i didn't listen to you you know i you guys talk about this abdominal will
[2:18:03.760 --> 2:18:08.560]  split things they do and like uh popular shows and things like that and i i wouldn't even have
[2:18:08.560 --> 2:18:13.680]  noticed it and if i didn't listen to you so like to uh you know thank you for being on the air
[2:18:13.680 --> 2:18:19.120]  otherwise i wouldn't even really know about most of all this stuff so well god bless you my friend
[2:18:19.120 --> 2:18:24.560]  i appreciate your call let's jam in another one here who's been holding the longest uh let's talk
[2:18:24.560 --> 2:18:30.720]  to james in florida james you're on the air go ahead hey thanks for taking my call alex thank you
[2:18:30.720 --> 2:18:35.760]  hey i i got a um article that was linked off a judge report it's actually a wall street journal
[2:18:35.760 --> 2:18:42.080]  article um but it's posted on foxnews.com from the lake on dredge says us officials syria using
[2:18:42.080 --> 2:18:46.880]  diplomats to threaten opposition around the world and there's a couple of things that are really
[2:18:46.880 --> 2:18:52.240]  kind of disconcerting about this they're talking about how the ambassador to syria and the us
[2:18:52.960 --> 2:18:59.760]  is actually taking pictures of these activists and then sending them back to uh the Assad regime
[2:18:59.760 --> 2:19:06.720]  who are then um using that to punish their family members overseas no no here's the deal Assad is a
[2:19:06.720 --> 2:19:12.720]  dirt bag his dad was a dirt bag but that doesn't mean we then go invade them and take over and then
[2:19:12.720 --> 2:19:19.040]  have to own that country and run everything um of course they're doing that i've got a great guy who
[2:19:19.040 --> 2:19:25.440]  works for me who's from venezuela absolutely hates chavez his family's been persecuted by him
[2:19:25.440 --> 2:19:29.200]  and i've tried to get him on air and talk about it he's a great guy and he goes look they'll go
[2:19:29.200 --> 2:19:34.880]  after my family and so this is what they do and that's why our government now photographs people
[2:19:34.880 --> 2:19:40.640]  at demonstrations it's all about intimidation what was your other point on that the other point is um
[2:19:40.640 --> 2:19:45.920]  you know the it says the obama administration says it's a there's credible evidence that the Assad
[2:19:45.920 --> 2:19:53.440]  regime is targeting relatives of syrian americans who participated in quote peaceful us protest which
[2:19:53.440 --> 2:19:59.840]  is laughable because you know there are no peaceful us process anymore here in the u.s. well that's
[2:19:59.840 --> 2:20:04.160]  right they demonize them all stay there attention gardeners this is an urgent gc and self-reliance
[2:20:04.160 --> 2:20:09.200]  update gc and has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants flowers and herbs
[2:20:09.200 --> 2:20:13.360]  it's called proto grow and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost
[2:20:13.360 --> 2:20:18.240]  force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and like conditions now here's the best
[2:20:18.240 --> 2:20:22.720]  part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance proto grows unique blend of sea nutrients
[2:20:22.720 --> 2:20:27.360]  maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set creating maximum plant growth in
[2:20:27.360 --> 2:20:31.760]  minimum time proto grow works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock
[2:20:31.760 --> 2:20:35.920]  the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants proto grows full spectrum plant fertility means
[2:20:35.920 --> 2:20:40.000]  fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste enough to 10 times the nutritional value and if

[2:24:18.320 --> 2:24:21.520]  i want to look at what's happening on the financial front here for a moment but finishing up with
[2:24:21.520 --> 2:24:27.040]  that last caller now i get where he was going um in fact it was it's been in the news lately that
[2:24:27.040 --> 2:24:31.920]  china and russia are saying hey you crack down on your protesters even more than we do in a lot of
[2:24:31.920 --> 2:24:38.320]  cases so stop lecturing us and that's really a shame that the us has lost the moral high ground
[2:24:38.320 --> 2:24:44.960]  on torture secret arrest turning off the cell phones and more than a third of san francisco
[2:24:44.960 --> 2:24:52.400]  ahead of a peaceful protest they just said well just in case we turned your cell phones off
[2:24:52.480 --> 2:24:57.200]  and the truth is everything you see authoritarian regimes do everything that makes a country in

[2:25:21.120 --> 2:25:24.880]  and uh it's just so ridiculous that their internal manuals say that the returning
[2:25:24.880 --> 2:25:31.200]  veterans of the number one threat because they know the vets are really the last line of defense
[2:25:31.200 --> 2:25:36.480]  in this country and if you're a new listener and haven't seen the documents that law enforcement
[2:25:36.480 --> 2:25:41.600]  sent us almost three years ago headline homeland security document says vets the number one
[2:25:41.600 --> 2:25:47.920]  threat you can watch it and now tsa psas on tv where all the terrorists are white people i mean

[2:26:53.520 --> 2:26:58.640]  the united states dollars falling against foreign currencies and all commodities are rising including
[2:26:58.640 --> 2:27:04.400]  oil uh you know and we're rising you know we're dropping against countries like germany now that
[2:27:04.400 --> 2:27:10.240]  is also on the brink of destruction which has been added to the european list i mean it's just like
[2:27:10.240 --> 2:27:14.960]  who who's fallen the fastest here and it just happens to be that the united states is winning
[2:27:14.960 --> 2:27:20.240]  the race at the moment you know how far down the road do we have to go before people wake up and go
[2:27:20.240 --> 2:27:25.040]  you know what this paper money thing isn't working i'm going to get into gold and silver if you got
[2:27:25.040 --> 2:27:29.520]  less than two percent of americans buying gold and silver and you can hardly get a hold of it dead
[2:27:29.520 --> 2:27:34.320]  and most brokers out there sold out they'll just take your order and you'll get you know the um
[2:27:34.320 --> 2:27:40.000]  this stuff months later you've got it on hand imagine when the general public finally figures it out
[2:27:40.000 --> 2:27:44.880]  and runs in that's already starting to happen a little bit that's why it's racing up i remember
[2:27:44.880 --> 2:27:49.840]  one a thousand dollars an ounce sounded insane but the the economic fact showed it would go there
[2:27:49.840 --> 2:27:56.320]  now jp morgan says 2,500 by the end of the year they should know um and that's their prediction
[2:27:56.320 --> 2:28:00.720]  so we'll see what happens i just know that you've bought the gold and silver when it's at a lower
[2:28:00.720 --> 2:28:05.840]  price and pass on those savings now you can get a great book exposing the orwellian takeover

[2:38:00.240 --> 2:38:07.040]  mamara turns out alex you may not know this but we have done some more deep research and
[2:38:07.040 --> 2:38:12.720]  turns out that only eight of those were turkish citizens the other one was a full fledged
[2:38:12.720 --> 2:38:20.160]  us citizen not a dual national he never registered for turkish citizenship he was born here
[2:38:20.720 --> 2:38:25.840]  and so the notion that there were eight turkish and one sort of turkish but he didn't look like
[2:38:25.840 --> 2:38:31.440]  us he wasn't really an american yeah he had american citizenship but you know we his life
[2:38:31.440 --> 2:38:37.520]  was expendable that was apparently put out by i don't know who the pr people in our government
[2:38:37.520 --> 2:38:45.040]  had to absolve the obama of any obligation any responsibility for protecting us citizens
[2:38:45.040 --> 2:38:48.560]  well after all the u.s. has liberty they were enemies with al-qaeda as well
[2:38:49.520 --> 2:38:55.440]  so there you go this year we decided to have our own boat when i say we i mean several of the u.s.
[2:38:55.440 --> 2:39:02.160]  passengers from last year i was invited to participate and lo and behold we converted
[2:39:02.160 --> 2:39:08.640]  we could raise to four hundred thousand dollars mostly in places like new york and la for example
[2:39:09.280 --> 2:39:17.600]  and rented a uh or charter exposed the right word a greek ferry boat and rehabilitated it
[2:39:17.600 --> 2:39:24.800]  it was all set to go we called it the audacity of hope we had 36 passengers including alice walker
[2:39:24.800 --> 2:39:32.000]  and uh all all manner of other young people and old people like me and we were also ready
[2:39:32.000 --> 2:39:38.720]  to sail against all the warnings from israel and from the united states the israelis said
[2:39:38.720 --> 2:39:43.520]  they were training sharpshooters that the same thing what happened this year is last that they
[2:39:43.520 --> 2:39:48.800]  had dogs that they were going to sit on our deck and that if we thought we were going to get through
[2:39:48.800 --> 2:39:55.840]  the blockade unscathed we had another think coming helary clinton said for her part don't you realize
[2:39:55.840 --> 2:40:02.240]  what happened last year you audacious uh people from the from the audacity of hope don't you don't
[2:40:02.240 --> 2:40:08.080]  you remember people got killed people got killed last year so don't even try it it was all in the
[2:40:08.080 --> 2:40:14.480]  passive voice you know people got killed well hello who killed the people it was the israeli
[2:40:14.480 --> 2:40:20.320]  commandos of course but that they came out and so you know instead of helary clinton going to the
[2:40:20.320 --> 2:40:26.240]  israeli commandos and saying or the israeli government say look we don't recognize your
[2:40:26.240 --> 2:40:33.840]  blockade is legal and that is the case u.s. does not recognize the israeli blockade of kasa as legal
[2:40:33.840 --> 2:40:40.480]  and so that being the case mr nissen yahoo we want to make sure that our 36 passengers five crew and
[2:40:40.480 --> 2:40:49.360]  10 mainstream media folks get through uh without being raided or shot up instead of that they uh
[2:40:49.360 --> 2:40:56.000]  they told us not to go and then when we get insisted on going we're already 10 miles out of the
[2:40:56.560 --> 2:41:03.040]  out of the uh pariahs port near athens uh the greek coast guard intercepted us drew us back
[2:41:03.040 --> 2:41:09.120]  to the harbor and became clear what had happened and that is that with all the bravado about what
[2:41:09.120 --> 2:41:14.160]  was going to happen to us if we went ahead with this cooler heads in the white house prevailed
[2:41:14.160 --> 2:41:21.360]  and they realized that the president asked netin yahoo please don't please don't massacre please
[2:41:21.360 --> 2:41:28.640]  don't shoot up our folks netin yahoo would turn his thumb to his nose as usual and say watch me
[2:41:29.280 --> 2:41:35.600]  and so the only way to prevent what would have been a real catastrophe a u.s. boat u.s. territory
[2:41:35.600 --> 2:41:42.000]  with alice walker all manner of other people on that boat including me getting shot up that would
[2:41:42.000 --> 2:41:47.760]  have been a disaster and so what do they do the u.s. lean really really hard on the greek government
[2:41:47.760 --> 2:41:54.080]  and said do not let any of those 10 boats from the gaza hotel at lee port and so that's what they
[2:41:54.080 --> 2:42:00.320]  did and we made a break for it but before we knew it we had not only the greek coast guard but a
[2:42:00.320 --> 2:42:07.040]  a coast guard cutter filled with these uh the commandos in black looking very much like the
[2:42:07.040 --> 2:42:13.520]  ones that attacked the mavi mamara after a two-hour standoff um our captain decided well
[2:42:14.240 --> 2:42:19.040]  we weren't going to be able to get any further out of the agn we were still in greek waters
[2:42:19.040 --> 2:42:25.440]  and so we came back now what's the lesson here the lesson here is simply that you know the
[2:42:25.440 --> 2:42:32.560]  thorough freedom of the seas aside uh israel was able if so fact though to extend its 12 mile limit
[2:42:32.560 --> 2:42:40.880]  into the agnc up to the port of parais near Athens it's really quite remarkable they were able
[2:42:40.880 --> 2:42:46.640]  to do that only because of the support of the united states the united states leaning real real
[2:42:46.640 --> 2:42:52.000]  hard on the greeks who were very vulnerable why were they vulnerable well they needed a second
[2:42:52.000 --> 2:42:58.800]  economic bailout financial bailout who runs the imf united states runs the imf well ray expanding
[2:42:58.800 --> 2:43:03.920]  on that you had a lot of courage to be doing this because they had announced they were going to attack
[2:43:03.920 --> 2:43:12.080]  the ship but from a pr perspective why not let medical supplies into gaza uh i mean why not
[2:43:12.080 --> 2:43:17.520]  just like coast guard board the ship check it out let people through well because they don't
[2:43:17.520 --> 2:43:22.240]  want humanitarian aid coming in there and according to national law and international law that is a
[2:43:22.240 --> 2:43:28.800]  war crime under the geneva convention and and if it's wrong for russians to break the convention
[2:43:28.800 --> 2:43:37.440]  it's wrong for israel it's wrong for the us to be a pawn in this geopolitical uh uh system but
[2:43:38.160 --> 2:43:43.520]  expanding on that i've also read about other boats that try to leave get their rudders sabotage so
[2:43:43.520 --> 2:43:53.360]  there is a giant program going on here to keep aid from getting into gaza but now uh enters uh
[2:43:53.360 --> 2:44:00.640]  enters israel and of course uh there i guess minion rick perry but i want to go back why did
[2:44:00.640 --> 2:44:05.840]  you believe in this so strongly that you were willing to risk your life to deliver aid to gaza
[2:44:05.840 --> 2:44:18.000]  well in a word alex the 2.6 million people living in gaza are being held in so what shall we say
[2:44:18.000 --> 2:44:24.400]  well it's the biggest open air prison in the world they are being kept on a near starvation diet
[2:44:25.200 --> 2:44:33.440]  israeli officials actually bragging about keeping the gazans on a quote very very strict
[2:44:33.440 --> 2:44:41.120]  diet end quote uh they're not going to starve but the israelis are preventing them from dying
[2:44:41.120 --> 2:44:50.080]  on mosques so that there won't be any accusations of uh genocide now that's no way any people should
[2:44:50.080 --> 2:44:57.200]  live the israelis are attacking gaza again from the air um there needs to be somebody stand up and
[2:44:57.200 --> 2:45:04.640]  say that's wrong and when your government and my government is responsible for allowing the israelis
[2:45:04.640 --> 2:45:10.480]  to do this giving them three billion dollars a year and and uh supporting them at every turn
[2:45:10.480 --> 2:45:17.440]  politically then you and i and all americans have a in my view a moral responsibility to say that's
[2:45:17.440 --> 2:45:24.480]  wrong and to try in a peaceful way to uh demonstrate how wrong it is now we didn't have any medical
[2:45:24.480 --> 2:45:30.000]  supplies all we had were letters letters from thousands of americans expressing support for
[2:45:30.000 --> 2:45:35.360]  the people of gaza so what we wanted to do is let the people of gaza know that they're not alone
[2:45:35.360 --> 2:45:41.760]  number one and number two we wanted to show that this blockade was illegal and of course uh
[2:45:41.760 --> 2:45:47.920]  with the state department unwilling to say it's legal then it is if so fact to illegal we're trying
[2:45:47.920 --> 2:45:56.000]  to highlight the plight of the gossands which uh really is a uh you know it's the the victim the
[2:45:56.000 --> 2:46:04.640]  victim being becoming the victimizer uh what the jewish people suffered in in germany is not very
[2:46:05.360 --> 2:46:11.120]  much worse than what they're subjecting to people not only in gaza but people in the other occupied
[2:46:11.120 --> 2:46:18.160]  territories territories that have been occupied for 44 years now which is a couple of years longer
[2:46:18.160 --> 2:46:24.480]  than the soviet union occupied eastern europe it's time for that to stop and unless we raise
[2:46:24.480 --> 2:46:30.960]  consciousness around the world and this is the interesting part of this because of the ingenuity
[2:46:30.960 --> 2:46:39.360]  and the hard work of the people running the us boat to gaza we had over 10 mainstream media on
[2:46:39.360 --> 2:46:48.000]  the boat and i'm talking new york times two cbs three cnn two democracy now two a couple of others
[2:46:48.000 --> 2:46:52.720]  okay algeza was represented by somebody else now what does that mean well they weren't just taking
[2:46:52.720 --> 2:46:57.520]  off picture alex they weren't just interviewing us they were on the boat when we made a break for it
[2:46:57.520 --> 2:47:02.480]  they were willing to suffer suffer the same fate that awaited us at the hands of the israeli
[2:47:02.480 --> 2:47:08.240]  commandos that's new and the fellow for the new york times actually did a very decent report well
[2:47:08.240 --> 2:47:12.960]  look there's no doubt that syria had a large part of its territory taken in the golan heights and a
[2:47:12.960 --> 2:47:19.120]  few months ago to watch all those men and women machine gunned who were peaceful and to watch our
[2:47:19.120 --> 2:47:24.160]  so-called media call them cowards and evil and terrorist i'm sorry machine gunning people
[2:47:25.200 --> 2:47:30.320]  peacefully walking with their nation's flag in their hand that's wrong i mean it would be wrong
[2:47:30.320 --> 2:47:35.440]  even you know if if if mexicans from mexico marched across and people mowed them down of course it'd
[2:47:35.440 --> 2:47:42.720]  be wrong even though i don't think texas belongs to mexico you still don't mow them down with live
[2:47:42.720 --> 2:47:47.280]  ammunition even if you're from the israeli perspective that no we took this land because
[2:47:47.280 --> 2:47:54.000]  you know you attacked us decades ago still just the cold-blooded shooting of people and to watch
[2:47:54.000 --> 2:48:00.960]  cnn fox and others defended as a very wholesome good thing is a very very dangerous trend and
[2:48:00.960 --> 2:48:08.880]  now we see my big beef is is israeli intelligence advising tsa homeland security on the see something
[2:48:08.880 --> 2:48:14.720]  say something spy grid here in the u.s and tsa on the streets and then you have uh rick perry and i
[2:48:14.720 --> 2:48:21.200]  want to get your take on this ray coming out and and saying arrest uh i guess ray mcgovern a arrest
[2:48:21.200 --> 2:48:26.000]  people that dared try to bring letters to folks i mean that that's that's that's pretty scary
[2:48:26.000 --> 2:48:34.240]  yeah it really is uh you would think uh off the wall here but here is perry with an official
[2:48:34.240 --> 2:48:41.360]  letter to eric holder the attorney general talking about the desperately deed we were doing and
[2:48:41.360 --> 2:48:48.240]  bringing uh breaking letters of support to the gaza and how we should be uh be brought up on
[2:48:48.240 --> 2:48:55.440]  charges of this or that um one of the one of the senator senator mark kirk one even father
[2:48:55.440 --> 2:49:00.400]  saying that you know we should be captured we should use the navy to help the israelis
[2:49:00.400 --> 2:49:08.480]  interdict us so you know uh in a way this brings out the real craziness in our one sided support
[2:49:08.480 --> 2:49:14.080]  for israel and i'll say just one more time that this is not good for israel either because they
[2:49:14.080 --> 2:49:21.280]  have to realize that this is not going to be able to be sustained the situation for many more years
[2:49:21.280 --> 2:49:27.360]  i'm not talking long term i'm talking short and medium term here uh something that it gives well
[2:49:27.360 --> 2:49:33.040]  ray i want to get into that but going back to us politicians calling for us citizens
[2:49:33.040 --> 2:49:37.280]  to have the military used against them ron paul has raised the point that they now have this
[2:49:37.280 --> 2:49:44.320]  extra judicial killing of us citizens on the books under bush and now obama and his lawyers
[2:49:44.320 --> 2:49:50.400]  continuing it uh i mean this is some pretty dangerous stuff and i see this is in the same
[2:49:50.400 --> 2:49:58.000]  avenue of saying these gozans are subhuman you're not even allowed to try to visit them or or you're
[2:49:58.000 --> 2:50:06.240]  seditious yeah there's a lot of uh sort of racism here um having to do not only with this but with
[2:50:06.240 --> 2:50:12.640]  the rock in afghanistan they don't look quite like us and so it's okay to shoot hellfire missiles
[2:50:12.640 --> 2:50:20.320]  from drones at them sitting in a in a possible office seven thousand miles away um it's it's
[2:50:20.320 --> 2:50:27.120]  early beyond the pale here and uh you know talk about gaza again well that is the collective
[2:50:27.120 --> 2:50:34.960]  punishment those people are being subjected to and that's a dead set against juneva well ray i
[2:50:34.960 --> 2:50:41.760]  want to come back and get into the geopolitical analysis why you're saying israel can't go much
[2:50:41.760 --> 2:50:47.120]  further along this line i mean i want people to be in peace i want israel the arabs the palestinians
[2:50:47.120 --> 2:50:54.240]  to be in peace and israel is losing the propaganda war uh by their arrogant actions so we'll we'll

[2:54:21.760 --> 2:54:34.960]  okay rena govern retired former c.i.a analyst putting on your analyst hat you're saying that
[2:54:34.960 --> 2:54:42.320]  time's running out for israel in their current posture towards the world and let me guess is
[2:54:42.320 --> 2:54:49.280]  that tie into this whole arab spring situation well it does very much alex uh first off when
[2:54:49.280 --> 2:54:56.800]  you look at egypt um you know egypt had been co-opted by promises from our country our tax
[2:54:56.800 --> 2:55:03.280]  dollars a half of what we give israel every year now we give israel three billion so mubarak was
[2:55:03.280 --> 2:55:09.840]  getting one point five billion every year if my math is correct okay now with that money he was a
[2:55:09.840 --> 2:55:18.400]  dependent ally of you know the arabs no way of israel israel had no reason to fear any anything
[2:55:18.400 --> 2:55:29.040]  untoward happening on its southern border and now now they've got 70 plus million egyptians who care
[2:55:29.040 --> 2:55:35.440]  about things like the oppression of their fellow arabs and specifically the palestinians they really
[2:55:35.440 --> 2:55:42.560]  care about that and is the the southern border as safe as it was with mubarak under no circumstances
[2:55:42.560 --> 2:55:49.360]  is it take to the north look at turkey well because they killed eight turkish citizens uh during the
[2:55:50.080 --> 2:55:57.360]  during the attack on a float cell last year uh the turks are in high dungeon as they should be
[2:55:57.360 --> 2:56:03.280]  and their prime minister threatened to travel to gaza later this month and i'm not sure he will
[2:56:03.280 --> 2:56:09.360]  but they are in a very bad relationship with israel now and they used to be very close greece by the
[2:56:09.360 --> 2:56:18.080]  way is is a poor substitute in terms of israel's strategic interests now in addition to all that
[2:56:18.080 --> 2:56:25.520]  they have a very insidious very very very dangerous new tactic being employed by the palestinians
[2:56:25.520 --> 2:56:33.840]  it's called unviolent civil disobedience okay we know it uh it wasn't invented here gondi
[2:56:33.840 --> 2:56:39.440]  can pretty much further it but martin with the king jr perfected it that's what they're doing all
[2:56:39.440 --> 2:56:50.160]  around the border areas when the when the anniversary of the 1948 displacement of over 700 000 palestinians
[2:56:50.160 --> 2:56:56.960]  to make way for the jewish people coming in in 1948 uh when the anniversary that came this year
[2:56:56.960 --> 2:57:02.640]  around all the borders of israel so we're talking that only lebanon we're talking syria
[2:57:02.640 --> 2:57:08.400]  we're talking jordan we're talking egypt along all those borders there were the kinds of nonviolent
[2:57:08.400 --> 2:57:14.160]  demonstrations in which some people crossed over the ones from syria you already mentioned and
[2:57:14.160 --> 2:57:19.840]  they got shut down a couple days later when they when he was still around so israel's are facing a
[2:57:19.840 --> 2:57:24.000]  situation now where they're going to have to compromise where they're going to have to recognize
[2:57:24.000 --> 2:57:30.080]  that palestinians have rights to that they're not able to keep them in a potential a state of
[2:57:30.080 --> 2:57:36.400]  servitude and unless they do that um they will be more and more ostracized from the rest of the world
[2:57:36.400 --> 2:57:44.320]  this divestment and so forth uh well ray we're almost out of time um clearly the west was involved
[2:57:44.320 --> 2:57:49.840]  finagling i guess trying to control the revolution in egypt now uh egypt has even expanded some of
[2:57:49.840 --> 2:57:54.960]  its crackdowns uh where do you see that going and and and what hand did the u.s government have
[2:57:54.960 --> 2:58:02.240]  of the state department just briefly uh and went on in egypt well we watched uh very closely and of
[2:58:02.240 --> 2:58:07.520]  course when we bought it uh left the scene then our support for him left the scene it was really
[2:58:07.520 --> 2:58:13.920]  pretty cynical now we have very few assets there we do have long-standing ties with their
[2:58:13.920 --> 2:58:19.280]  intelligence service and their army but whether those will be effective these days as anybody's
[2:58:19.280 --> 2:58:24.800]  guess it'll take a period of turmoil but when the election comes i think it's next month is it not
[2:58:24.800 --> 2:58:30.000]  yes that we'll let know a lot more then all right reama govern thank you so much for speaking
