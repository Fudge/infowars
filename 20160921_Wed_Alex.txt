[00:00.000 --> 00:18.840]  All assembly in New York City spent the day painting a rosy picture around the autocratic
[00:18.840 --> 00:21.400]  nightmare known as Agenda 2030.
[00:21.400 --> 00:26.760]  In this great hall the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development was adopted.
[00:26.760 --> 00:32.120]  With its 17 Sustainable Development goals the Agenda is hugely ambitious, imbued with
[00:32.120 --> 00:38.000]  the universal and transformative spirit the Agenda sets out as a master plan for us to
[00:38.000 --> 00:58.840]  get it.
[00:58.840 --> 01:03.280]  And then President Obama stepped up to the New World Order podium for his final love
[01:03.280 --> 01:07.080]  fest of himself as the President of the United States.
[01:07.080 --> 01:12.520]  As if speaking into the vacuum of space Obama lectured the international body of globalist
[01:12.520 --> 01:18.320]  banking pawns with half-truths and grandiose ideas.
[01:18.320 --> 01:23.200]  After eight years of diligently checking off the multinational corporations to-do list
[01:23.200 --> 01:28.520]  at the expense of any real hope or change benefiting the citizens of the United States.
[01:28.520 --> 01:33.400]  We have made international institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary
[01:33.400 --> 01:38.840]  Fund more representative while establishing a framework to protect our planet from the
[01:38.840 --> 01:40.760]  ravages of climate change.
[01:40.760 --> 01:45.280]  We see too many governments muscling journalists and quashing dissent and censoring the flow
[01:45.280 --> 01:46.880]  of information.
[01:46.880 --> 01:52.800]  In medicine and in manufacturing and education and communications we're experiencing a transformation
[01:52.800 --> 01:57.940]  of how human beings live on a scale that recalls the revolutions in agriculture.
[01:57.940 --> 02:03.680]  The existing path to global integration requires a course correction and as these real problems
[02:03.680 --> 02:09.640]  have been neglected alternative visions of the world have pressed forward both in the
[02:09.640 --> 02:11.140]  wealthiest countries.
[02:11.140 --> 02:15.960]  I guess from her bosses came out and they said ma'am what about his you know compulsiveness
[02:15.960 --> 02:25.240]  Trump saying it was a bombing or tribe or sect aggressive nationalism accrued populism
[02:25.240 --> 02:29.840]  some of the unedited clip coming up this is incredible we covered this yesterday on the
[02:29.840 --> 02:36.320]  Sunday show Trump was on Fox News this morning pointing it out how disgusting and despicable
[02:36.320 --> 02:42.480]  and sickening these people are I mean this is an occupied globalist force and if you
[02:42.480 --> 02:46.680]  ever thought that I was kidding around and I broke down the emails of George Soros that
[02:46.680 --> 02:51.280]  WikiLeaks and others have released along with DCLeaks where he openly said we want to destroy
[02:51.280 --> 02:54.040]  Europe and get rid of Europeans.
[02:54.040 --> 03:01.360]  We now have a TV ad from Germany saying how great it is to wear the hajib for German women
[03:01.360 --> 03:08.040]  but it gets worse we now have Swedish TV coming up produced by the government so is the German
[03:08.040 --> 03:14.640]  ad by the UN where it says Sweden is over it's got subtitles this is the end said it's
[03:14.640 --> 03:20.320]  been a woman in a hajib looks up and says get used to it quote let me give the exact
[03:20.320 --> 03:33.520]  quote this country Sweden is old you are gone we are the future this from the Swedish government
[03:33.520 --> 03:41.660]  officially this is an official battle plan full burkas as a woman's right when these
[03:41.660 --> 03:45.920]  women are prisoners so you've got that whole issue and you've got the mainstream media
[03:45.920 --> 03:54.840]  falling on its sword in delusion committing suicide in front of everyone politically
[03:54.840 --> 04:00.160]  saying that Donald Trump is wrong to come out and say there's been bombings when it
[04:00.160 --> 04:05.480]  was a bombing being decisive is now being compulsive then Hillary comes out says it's
[04:05.480 --> 04:09.920]  a bomb they say no man you don't say that Trump says it oh you're right he's bad for
[04:09.920 --> 04:16.320]  saying it's a bomb in the same sentence then CNN and other it's like Missoula Montana and
[04:16.320 --> 04:21.520]  Charleston West Virginia billionaire Obama and Hillary Clinton supporter George Soros
[04:21.520 --> 04:28.240]  adds more insult to injury by announcing a donation of $500 million to keep the destabilization
[04:28.240 --> 04:35.440]  of civilization on an even keel CNBC reported the 86 year old George Soros said in an official
[04:35.440 --> 04:41.960]  statement we will invest in startups established companies social impact initiatives and businesses
[04:41.960 --> 04:48.000]  started by migrants and refugees will the unemployed coal miners be working for the refugees
[04:48.000 --> 04:54.040]  now John bound for info wars dot com ladies and gentlemen it's Wednesday the 21st day
[04:54.040 --> 04:59.160]  of September 2016 we're going to come back and talk about the biggest debate in history
[04:59.160 --> 05:04.440]  set for next Monday billionaire George Soros has given yet another massive lump sum to
[05:04.440 --> 05:09.720]  Hillary Clinton the Hill reports he gave 2.5 million to a pro-clinton pack and a final
[05:09.720 --> 05:15.040]  desperate push weeks before the national election Soros joins a chorus of hedge fund moguls that
[05:15.040 --> 05:19.920]  are pouring stunning amounts of cash into the main super PAC supporting Clintons campaign
[05:19.920 --> 05:24.280]  hedge funders like Donald Sussman a liberal financier that's New York City based he's
[05:24.280 --> 05:29.960]  given at least 10.5 million along with George Soros to priorities USA priorities USA is
[05:29.960 --> 05:34.640]  the group that has unreserved more than 150 million in advertising cash to help Clinton
[05:34.640 --> 05:39.480]  win the election this news comes as the Clinton Foundation is planning to drop dozens of employees
[05:39.480 --> 05:44.560]  like flies from its payroll saying that they're closing many of its operations Politico reports
[05:44.560 --> 05:48.860]  that two former Clinton Foundation officials will remain on their communication staff the
[05:48.860 --> 05:53.160]  Clintons are shutting down their controversial cartel and severing many of its personal
[05:53.160 --> 05:58.000]  ties still using primary donors like Soros to continue funding Clinton I'm Margaret

[08:18.160 --> 08:42.640]  ladies and gentlemen my plate is absolutely completely full of over the top information
[08:42.640 --> 08:48.560]  Obama did his last official U.N. speech as president calling for a liberal world order
[08:48.560 --> 08:53.280]  yes the world governments now liberal so your racist if you oppose mega corporations above
[08:53.280 --> 08:58.960]  the law the tax and control your lives more foundation news is coming out where you would
[08:58.960 --> 09:06.240]  just pay Obama and Hillary and get ambassadorships and other high powered placements completely
[09:06.240 --> 09:12.160]  criminal they should all be arrested John Boehner has cashing out he's joining corporate
[09:12.160 --> 09:17.800]  lobbying firm that represents China so you know why he won't go after Hillary or wouldn't
[09:17.800 --> 09:23.240]  go after Hillary for representing the communist Chinese as the secretary of state I mean this
[09:23.240 --> 09:30.640]  treason is flagrant beyond flagrant we're going to break all of that down we're going
[09:30.640 --> 09:37.840]  to get into the latest terror threats and terror cells in the country and the state
[09:37.840 --> 09:42.720]  department admitting they know that they're bringing people in that are on terrorist watch
[09:42.720 --> 09:49.440]  lists so we're spied on by the NSA to control the American people but then when the father
[09:49.440 --> 09:54.360]  says my son's gonna attack or when it's known people are visiting terrorist training camps
[09:54.360 --> 09:59.960]  or it's known that they are actual terrorists they're left alone this is open and shut we
[09:59.960 --> 10:06.960]  have an illegitimate rogue criminal government but before I go any further because it ties
[10:06.960 --> 10:14.880]  in to 650 million pledged by globalist corporations in the U.S. alone 500 million more by Soros
[10:14.880 --> 10:20.440]  this week 100 million two weeks ago by the Ford Foundation to fund open borders to fund
[10:20.440 --> 10:26.920]  collapsing economies and to fund focusing the revolution that's coming onto local government
[10:26.920 --> 10:33.680]  and police to ensure the further breakdown of society than the globalist come in and
[10:33.680 --> 10:40.400]  mop things up I want to air air another powerful report John Bown has done that ties into this
[10:40.400 --> 10:48.960]  the United Nations refugee agenda strikes the USA and then we come back Obama said quote
[10:48.960 --> 10:57.320]  submit to world government oh Americans don't understand international norms I'm so sorry
[10:57.320 --> 11:00.880]  but we're going to have to accept them you mean what globalist impose on third world
[11:00.880 --> 11:05.800]  countries that's now the norm here you mean Chinese style censorship that's now the norm
[11:05.800 --> 11:12.320]  here they are dropping the hammer all these articles and videos are upon info wars dot
[11:12.320 --> 11:17.840]  com and prison planet dot com and it's all coming up today also remember a few months
[11:17.840 --> 11:22.720]  ago our reporters were in New York City and a man got beaten up for just politely talking
[11:22.720 --> 11:29.080]  to black lives matter saying what are you gonna do when ISIS comes and strikes New York headline
[11:29.080 --> 11:36.240]  info wars dot com man who was beaten up for warning of ISIS attacks in New York by BLM
[11:36.240 --> 11:41.480]  proven right we're going to play that as well and then the big news just a gut level told
[11:41.480 --> 11:44.960]  me because I knew they were going to quote have the feed hosted by a major university
[11:44.960 --> 11:49.760]  in New York and so you could have every media outlet from info wars to you name it carry
[11:49.760 --> 11:54.160]  the feed we won't just be analyzing it and talking over this debate that's how we can
[11:54.160 --> 11:59.600]  legally you know carry a debate that have been hijacked by the mainstream media I don't
[11:59.600 --> 12:03.400]  believe they should be able to do that I believe it should be feeds available to all media
[12:03.400 --> 12:08.600]  just like they're now doing so so so this debate is 90 minutes coming up eight o'clock
[12:08.600 --> 12:12.960]  central will have an hour of live coverage before and then we're going to carry the feed
[12:12.960 --> 12:19.400]  live with limited comments during clapping or breaks by yours truly but we're gonna have
[12:19.400 --> 12:25.800]  our crew in live time fact-checking and grabbing snippets and analyzing and putting clips out
[12:25.800 --> 12:31.160]  while the hour and a half debate goes on them will have an hour and a half of live post
[12:31.160 --> 12:38.120]  debate analysis in your phone calls so we're gonna do a big one two three four four hour
[12:38.120 --> 12:46.160]  transmission next Monday info wars dot com forward slash show for the free feeds radio
[12:46.160 --> 12:50.120]  affiliates are gonna be picking it up a lot of our TV affiliates are also picking it up
[12:50.120 --> 12:54.360]  this is very very exciting double the counter the establishment media and live time but
[12:54.360 --> 13:02.000]  because this is just gonna be monitored and basically refereed by a lesser halt who I think
[13:02.000 --> 13:05.760]  will do a pretty good job he's got a pretty good record of at least when he hosts debates
[13:05.760 --> 13:11.720]  and things you know not throwing too many curveballs we'll see what happens though lesser halt
[13:11.720 --> 13:15.200]  is the one that's basically moderating but he's not the one hosting it it's a new york
[13:15.200 --> 13:20.560]  university so we're gonna actually be carrying the debate not just giving commentary on it
[13:20.560 --> 13:26.800]  next Monday but listen my gut tells me there's a very good chance I'd say 50 50 I don't want
[13:26.800 --> 13:30.400]  to stick my neck out but I think Hillary's gonna find a way to cancel or she's gonna
[13:30.400 --> 13:36.160]  have a coughing fit and maybe even collapse I don't like to get metaphysical but months
[13:36.160 --> 13:41.960]  ago before she fell down in New York I was having dreams where she was at a debate with
[13:41.960 --> 13:46.560]  Trump and falls over now I'm not saying what's gonna happen obviously most what you dream
[13:46.560 --> 13:51.120]  of you know isn't you know prescient but I'm telling you I wonder if Vegas has opened up
[13:51.120 --> 13:56.240]  a betting line on whether she's gonna make it a or B collapse during it all right let's
[13:56.240 --> 14:01.920]  go to this John Bown report dulls me for a moment what if one of your relative spouse
[14:01.920 --> 14:07.920]  child or even you innocently absorb the shrapnel from one of the bombs detonated in Manhattan
[14:07.920 --> 14:13.440]  on Saturday night or had just taken a knife wound in a mall in St. Cloud Minnesota who
[14:13.440 --> 14:18.240]  would you hold accountable the radicalized black lives matter supporting Afghanistan
[14:18.240 --> 14:25.200]  born suspect Ahmed Khan Rahami or the Kenyan born Dahir a Don a knife wielding radical
[14:25.200 --> 14:30.480]  psychopath we are supposed to accept as a lone wolf or is it Donald Trump because he
[14:30.480 --> 14:36.520]  is the only one cutting through the progressive BS a display of honesty the PC culture has
[14:36.520 --> 14:43.200]  zero ability to accept after years of brainwashing to their own peril and I'll have more to say
[14:43.200 --> 14:48.480]  about it when we actually know the fact I must tell you that just before I got off the
[14:48.480 --> 14:54.640]  plane a bomb went off in New York and nobody knows exactly what's going on but boy we are
[14:54.640 --> 15:01.000]  living in a time we better get very tough folks you better get very very tough or are
[15:01.000 --> 15:06.720]  the true culprits sitting comfortably with no fear of persecution many of them equally
[15:06.720 --> 15:12.720]  as untouchable as Hillary Clinton smugly pushing the narrative of the crisis and normalization
[15:12.720 --> 15:18.040]  of the jihadist invasion of these United States in the halls of the United Nations
[15:18.040 --> 15:24.720]  in New York City right now it feels what has been a perennial gap in the international
[15:24.720 --> 15:31.760]  protection system that of truly sharing responsibility for refugees in the spirit of the United
[15:31.760 --> 15:38.280]  Nations Charter but hey whoops the AP reports the U.S. government has mistakenly granted
[15:38.280 --> 15:43.000]  citizenship to at least eight hundred and fifty eight immigrants from countries of concerned
[15:43.000 --> 15:48.440]  and national security or with high rates of immigration fraud who had pending deportation
[15:48.440 --> 15:53.440]  orders according to an internal homeland security audit released on Monday the Washington
[15:53.440 --> 16:01.200]  Examiner reports nearly 20% of the 4600 Syrian refugees already brought to the United States
[16:01.200 --> 16:06.480]  were settled in the New York New Jersey area the site of the weekend bombings that reportedly
[16:06.480 --> 16:13.120]  could be a dry run of future terror attacks CNS News reported almost a hundred thousand
[16:13.120 --> 16:19.680]  Somali refugees have been resettled in the United States since 9-11 including 8,619 so
[16:19.680 --> 16:25.640]  far during the current fiscal year the largest number some 16% of the total over the past
[16:25.640 --> 16:31.320]  15 years have been resettled in Minnesota home to the nation's biggest Somali American
[16:31.320 --> 16:41.880]  community of the 97,046 Somali refugees admitted to the U.S. since the fall of 2001 99.6% were
[16:41.880 --> 16:52.240]  Muslim and 28,836 29.7% were males between the ages of 14 and 50 under Hillary Clinton's
[16:52.240 --> 16:58.560]  watch as Secretary of State roughly 700,000 Muslim immigrants were brought in a very
[16:58.560 --> 17:05.640]  conservative estimation claims that 10 to 20% of those are radicalized and Obama still
[17:05.640 --> 17:11.720]  wants to keep bringing them in that's his answer to 29 innocent Americans being shredded
[17:11.720 --> 17:18.600]  by shrapnel in Manhattan. Meanwhile, London's Stan Mayer Sadik Khan is throwing the first
[17:18.600 --> 17:24.640]  ball at the Mets game as if all is going according to the globalist plan. We are under total
[17:24.640 --> 17:30.440]  attack by a destabilization agenda of Western culture blinded by our own tolerance of a
[17:30.440 --> 17:36.120]  supposed religion of peace actually in the process of a total jihad that has been in
[17:36.120 --> 17:41.440]  effect in one way shape or form for over 1400 years. Our government didn't seem to have
[17:41.440 --> 17:47.480]  a problem killing a supposed radicalized religious cult in Waco. What makes the dormant terror
[17:47.480 --> 17:53.240]  cells across the United States any different? Our American citizens supposed to sit on
[17:53.240 --> 17:58.720]  their hands while fellow citizens are blown up on U.S. soil and casually reported in the
[17:58.720 --> 18:03.320]  news cycle knowing full well that what has become the normalized terror in the Middle
[18:03.320 --> 18:08.280]  East is now going to be a day to day occurrence here in the United States while the United
[18:08.280 --> 18:13.960]  Nations sets up a strong cities network intended to enforce the United Nations Small Arms
[18:13.960 --> 18:19.880]  Treaty. Our Constitution grants U.S. citizens the dividing powers between the central and
[18:19.880 --> 18:26.240]  state governments, the branches of government a system of checks and balances and equal representation
[18:26.240 --> 18:32.640]  of the states. President Obama has routinely violated that power routinely supported by
[18:32.640 --> 18:39.000]  George Soros and the United Nations. With these latest attacks there can be little doubt
[18:39.000 --> 18:46.080]  now a traitor occupies the White House and another traitor intends on moving in. John
[18:46.080 --> 18:52.080]  bound for enforce.com. You know I don't want to just sit here and say George Soros is behind
[18:52.080 --> 18:57.720]  everything but he is really one of the top generals trying to bring down Western civilization
[18:57.720 --> 19:04.080]  and promote evil. I mean if you ask what side of Soros on it's always the side of evil.
[19:04.080 --> 19:10.160]  This guy is the basis of modern James Bond villains. That's admitted that's how bad
[19:10.160 --> 19:14.440]  he is but they believe their crimes are so great and connected to so many politicians
[19:14.440 --> 19:20.240]  in different countries that they're too big to fail. They're such big gangsters they believe
[19:20.240 --> 19:26.360]  they're invincible. Now when we come back Barack Obama pushing world government basically
[19:26.360 --> 19:30.240]  putting down the United States like we're a bunch of idiot country bumpkins that we're
[19:30.240 --> 19:35.640]  not conforming to international standards when it's the American robber barons that
[19:35.640 --> 19:41.880]  set up the UN program with their European counterparts. It's all coming up plus rioters
[19:41.880 --> 19:50.000]  attack truck drivers Luke Wal-Mart after black man shot dead by black cop. We don't know
[19:50.000 --> 19:55.720]  the details of this yet but we do know the Tulsa shooting of innocent black man who was
[19:55.720 --> 19:59.960]  just there with his stalled vehicle is very very sad but it's not the basis for a civil
[19:59.960 --> 20:29.160]  war.
[20:29.160 --> 20:37.520]  You know about RVs you've heard about bunkers but surviving is not recreation and man wasn't
[20:37.520 --> 20:43.360]  made to live underground introducing survivalist camps. The ultimate fully functional off the

[21:01.840 --> 21:06.160]  Water Warburg won the Nobel Prize for discovering how cells breathe. He also discovered how
[21:06.160 --> 21:10.640]  normal cells turn into tumor cells. He discovered the one prime cause of cancer was cellular
[21:10.640 --> 21:15.600]  oxygen deficiency. Dr. Joanna Budwig built upon the work of Dr. Warburg and discovered
[21:15.600 --> 21:20.000]  how to feed the cells to overcome this oxygen deficiency. She found that it was a sulfur
[21:20.000 --> 21:24.280]  in the cottage cheese that would mix with fresh pressed flax oil that the flax oil would become
[21:24.280 --> 21:28.840]  emulsified and more readily absorbed. Flax oil delivered in this manner was able to restore
[21:28.840 --> 21:33.720]  oxygen transfer to all cells of the body. Now there's a new method of pressing seed oils
[21:33.720 --> 21:38.760]  that produces the highest quality zero oxidation undamaged seed oils. The results on these seed
[21:38.760 --> 21:43.800]  oils alone are amazing. Now add our life force enhanced one-world-way protein powder that
[21:43.800 --> 21:48.320]  is much higher in the sulfur amino acids than cottage cheese is and you have a winning combination
[21:48.320 --> 21:57.320]  to confer health and energy like never before. Call 888-988-3325 or visit sacredseedoils.com.

[24:08.240 --> 24:13.560]  Well, the State Department has come out admitted that there are terrorists coming in with the
[24:13.560 --> 24:20.680]  refugees. I was watching Fox News this morning. The supposed conservative alternative, fair
[24:20.680 --> 24:27.740]  and balanced. And five days after the terror attack last Saturday or terror attacks, they
[24:27.740 --> 24:33.540]  were still saying, is it terror? Is it lone wolf? Can we call it terror? And they had
[24:33.540 --> 24:39.160]  FBI and other counterterrorism experts on TV talking to people like they were three
[24:39.160 --> 24:45.500]  years old. And I said to myself, is this the twilight zone? They are deliberately dumbing
[24:45.500 --> 24:56.940]  information down. The message is the medium. And then you tune to CNN or MSNBC. It's even
[24:56.940 --> 25:02.980]  crazier. And now Hillary is trying to be Donald Trump with her big airplane behind her when
[25:02.980 --> 25:11.060]  she gives her little speeches. And suddenly she wants to have strong vetting and background
[25:11.060 --> 25:17.180]  checks of people coming in. She's becoming Donald Trump with how many days left to this
[25:17.180 --> 25:24.460]  most historic of elections, 40, 47 edge of your seat days. And you talk about edge of
[25:24.460 --> 25:32.540]  your seat. I was calm when I got up here this morning. And when I went over the news and
[25:32.540 --> 25:40.460]  I looked at the information, I was hyperventilating. The energy level was so high and sweating.
[25:40.460 --> 25:47.220]  And I'm not somebody that's ever sweated in front of a crowd or going on there unless
[25:47.220 --> 25:51.020]  it's hot. And it's not even hot. And I was talking to the crew to ask, why do you think
[25:51.020 --> 25:54.780]  I'm suddenly breaking out in a sweat? And they said, it's the energy. Everybody can
[25:54.780 --> 26:00.540]  feel it. Other people I know said, we're breaking out in sweats. Just listening to this stuff.
[26:00.540 --> 26:08.140]  It is crazy. I mean, we've got Obama going before the UN. We played part of it earlier.
[26:08.140 --> 26:11.660]  I want to play more of it here in a moment. Just, yeah, you know, Americans just understand
[26:11.660 --> 26:15.260]  international standards. I'm trying to get them to do it. Like it's just reasonable to
[26:15.260 --> 26:22.300]  have open borders and turn your guns in and have 80% tax rates and blah, blah, blah. This
[26:22.300 --> 26:25.860]  is the guy that became the head of the UN for a period of time, the first time ever violating
[26:25.860 --> 26:30.220]  article one, section nine. We became the head of the security council. Remember that? Rubbing
[26:30.220 --> 26:34.220]  our noses in it. So I want to talk about this. And when we come back, I want to get into
[26:34.220 --> 26:39.980]  the mega debate, the biggest debate in history. They're saying a hundred million. I had
[26:39.980 --> 26:44.540]  guesstimated a few weeks ago that it'd be as big as a playoff game, 70 million. Super
[26:44.540 --> 26:54.220]  bowls are 80 to 90 million, a hundred million. The biggest TV show in history was MASH. The
[26:54.220 --> 27:02.220]  1983 finale got 100 million mark. They're saying this is going to surpass that. And the good
[27:02.220 --> 27:08.700]  news is everybody can carry it. I can go pay a service, get a feed and carry the thing
[27:08.700 --> 27:12.980]  with info wars logo on it. We're going to be doing that, but also analyzing the media,
[27:12.980 --> 27:17.740]  what they're up to. But that's coming up this Monday from seven. It kicks off at eight.
[27:17.740 --> 27:23.500]  But seven o'clock central, eight o'clock central from the debate starts 90 minutes.
[27:23.500 --> 27:26.580]  We come back. We're going to discuss this and I'm going to open the phones up too. Do
[27:26.580 --> 27:29.860]  you think Hillary who can't even stand up for 10 minutes who has coughing fits constantly
[27:29.860 --> 27:36.500]  lose, falling down the secret service told us every hour. And I said, well, specifically,
[27:36.500 --> 27:43.220]  and they said, look, sometimes they're at 15, 20 minutes. She's so drugged up, though,
[27:43.220 --> 27:48.700]  to suppress the seizures that she's not as sick then, but then to be able to look like
[27:48.700 --> 27:56.980]  she's not drugged out of her mind and totally bedraggled and somewhat focused so she can
[27:56.980 --> 28:04.220]  horn swaddle the public. They've got to take her off the depressants. That's what you give
[28:04.220 --> 28:12.460]  people to stop seizures is different spectrums of depressants. My dad's brother groggy, slow
[28:12.460 --> 28:18.420]  when he's on the depressants, just as smart as I am or my dad is when he's off the depressants.
[28:18.420 --> 28:24.740]  He now has a brain ship. That's how they treat this. They don't just have nerve stimulators.
[28:24.740 --> 28:31.540]  He's also have brain ships and he's got a brain ship and it's amazing. He is normal
[28:31.540 --> 28:37.060]  now, but then all of a sudden he'll go, well, I tell you, it's a very nice, very nice day
[28:37.060 --> 28:42.500]  today. It sounds like a machine. It is wild. And then that goes for 30 seconds. He goes,
[28:42.500 --> 28:47.860]  oh, it was stabilizing me. I'm okay now. I mean, that's the 21st century folks where
[28:47.860 --> 28:53.860]  someone in my family has a brain ship. And the point I'm getting at is I know about epilepsy.
[28:53.860 --> 28:57.860]  I know about head injuries. You know about it. Most people have been touched by head
[28:57.860 --> 29:04.340]  injuries or genetic epilepsy or a chemically caused epilepsy. And so we know Hillary Clinton's
[29:04.340 --> 29:08.020]  got serious brain problems. She's degenerating quickly and I've already digressed. So I'll
[29:08.020 --> 29:15.420]  come back, get into Obama and the world government garbage at the UN rubbing our noses in it.
[29:15.420 --> 29:20.220]  And then we'll get into the debate. I'm going to open the phones up for longtime callers,
[29:20.220 --> 29:28.100]  who specifically want to talk about the debate. I want to hear from you. Do you think Hillary
[29:28.100 --> 29:33.180]  will make it to the debate? And then if she does, will she have a coughing fit? I think
[29:33.180 --> 29:36.820]  that's a foregone conclusion. She gave a 10 minute speech earlier this week, had to quit
[29:36.820 --> 29:41.860]  and then had to cancel all our other events until next Monday. So she's resting, sleeping
[29:41.860 --> 29:47.460]  beauty, the sleeping, sleeping Medusa down in her crypt, getting ready for next Monday.
[29:47.460 --> 29:51.660]  Will she have a coughing fit guaranteed? Will she collapse? Probably. I don't think she'll
[29:51.660 --> 29:54.460]  make it. I don't think she'll make it. What do you think? Stay with us.
[29:54.460 --> 30:01.460]  Alex Jones, LHCN Radio Network.
[30:01.460 --> 30:05.620]  Capitol Hill lawmakers are hornlocked in a bitter battle this week, one side trying to
[30:05.620 --> 30:12.020]  block President Obama's bid to sell 1.15 billion in U.S. arms to Saudi Arabia. The massive
[30:12.020 --> 30:16.940]  sale of tanks, guns and other military equipment to the Saudis has driven a wedge among U.S.
[30:16.940 --> 30:21.420]  lawmakers. Some on the Hill calling Gridia a good ally, while others saying its occupation
[30:21.420 --> 30:26.100]  of Yemen is most assuredly where these weapons will be used. We know the Saudis hit Yemeni
[30:26.100 --> 30:31.500]  hospitals, schools and other civilian targets. Senator Rand Paul from Kentucky said he pushed
[30:31.500 --> 30:36.220]  to end the U.S. assistance to Saudi Arabia in the war in Yemen. Paul says, quote, this
[30:36.220 --> 30:40.620]  is part of a larger effort by many of us to say that Congress is not only relevant but
[30:40.620 --> 30:45.300]  has the primary role and duty of the initiation of war. All of this while the president is
[30:45.300 --> 30:49.580]  preaching, quote, tough love to the Saudis, this tough love doesn't include deals like
[30:49.580 --> 30:54.140]  this, of course. Obama has sold more advanced weaponry to Saudi leaders than any of his
[30:54.140 --> 30:58.780]  predecessors, despite their atrocious human rights record. I'm Margaret Howell reporting
[30:58.780 --> 31:05.860]  for infowars.com. We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical
[31:05.860 --> 31:10.660]  that we can produce about a group you took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[31:10.660 --> 31:14.100]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think
[31:14.100 --> 31:19.500]  it's very, very important. What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we
[31:19.500 --> 31:25.340]  lose a little bit of our telomeres. Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[31:25.340 --> 31:30.380]  And when it runs out, you start dying. We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different
[31:30.380 --> 31:35.020]  clinical trials. It's one of the most effective substances in the world. It works like an
[31:35.020 --> 31:40.940]  antioxidant. It works to repair nerve growth factor. So this is a formula to deliver the
[31:40.940 --> 31:46.900]  maximum amount. It's in powder form. We have so many five star reviews. I take this. This
[31:46.900 --> 31:52.140]  is this is the product that I take infowarslife.com and the profit we make. We fight the global
[31:52.140 --> 31:56.940]  if we fight the new world order. Secure your DNA Force today at infowarslife.com or call

[32:03.060 --> 32:07.900]  year to do it. Why is this so good? Because people are actually waking up to the problem
[32:07.900 --> 32:13.420]  that pretty much scares me the most. I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins
[32:13.420 --> 32:19.620]  from food and water and beverages in my system. But right now we're dealing with massive parasites,
[32:19.620 --> 32:24.220]  which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism right now
[32:24.220 --> 32:30.420]  with all the refugees spreading disease around. We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[32:30.420 --> 32:33.380]  These are all parasites. Tell us about all the stuff that said there's so many things
[32:33.380 --> 32:38.060]  that are in it. You have the name in there. You have the organic clove bud, the organic
[32:38.060 --> 32:42.340]  wormwood. I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year. All right, well, I'm
[32:42.340 --> 32:46.100]  glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today. It just came back in yesterday.
[32:46.100 --> 32:49.940]  Living defense infowarslife.com and folks, you can't lose full of stuff that's great
[32:49.940 --> 32:55.500]  for your body, period. And you support the broadcast infowarslife.com. Thank you, Dr.
[32:55.500 --> 33:06.500]  Groot, from the Global Healing Center. Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this
[33:06.500 --> 33:32.660]  one. It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. So, I'm not a gambling man. I'm not saying
[33:32.660 --> 33:36.660]  I haven't played poker a few times in my life and put some money on it back in college or
[33:36.660 --> 33:46.700]  whatever, but I wonder if Vegas has already opened up a line or I wonder if London has
[33:46.700 --> 33:51.100]  opened up a line. They'll take a bet on anything. I know that. I'd almost want to open up a
[33:51.100 --> 34:02.820]  bet just as almost like a crowdsourced poll. Open up a line to see how many people think
[34:02.820 --> 34:08.940]  Hillary is going to show up for the debate and they can also have bets on how many times
[34:08.940 --> 34:15.940]  she'll cough during the debate and then see will she collapse during the debate or will
[34:15.940 --> 34:19.980]  she have to take a break and then come out 10 minutes late from the bathroom like she
[34:19.980 --> 34:29.460]  did last time? Because our sources say she's having epileptic seizures every 15, 20 minutes
[34:29.460 --> 34:35.820]  when she goes off the drugs. And how does the Secret Service know she's on drugs? When
[34:35.820 --> 34:39.700]  her hair is all sticking up and she looks like she just woke up from a 100-year nap
[34:39.700 --> 34:46.940]  and she clearly looks like somebody on depressants. She looks like the two members of my family
[34:46.940 --> 34:53.740]  that I have known that had epilepsy. When they're coming off a big epileptic seizure
[34:53.740 --> 34:58.220]  and bit half their tongue off, the doctor says, double down on your medication and they
[34:58.220 --> 35:09.660]  can hardly talk. Well, that's how the bedraggled. I mean, Hillary looks wrinkled, hair all sticking
[35:09.660 --> 35:14.060]  out. She looks like a bag lady and I'm not being mean on how she looks. She does not
[35:14.060 --> 35:22.140]  look residential. She does not look like Margaret Thatcher. She does not look like the head
[35:22.140 --> 35:27.540]  of the IMF, La Grande, who's an evil lady, but you know, looks good. Nice hair, dress
[35:27.540 --> 35:33.340]  nice. Imagine if Obama started coming out with wrinkled suits and his hair sticking
[35:33.340 --> 35:39.260]  out and his eyes all looking wild and he started falling down. I mean, because he's a man,
[35:39.260 --> 35:42.980]  they'd eat his lunch. It doesn't matter what color he is. People wouldn't put up with it.
[35:42.980 --> 35:47.260]  But because it's a woman, it's supposedly okay. I mean, there's so many angles to this.
[35:47.260 --> 35:51.660]  So I want to hear from you. I want to take a lot of calls on this subject. So you don't
[35:51.660 --> 36:02.860]  have to hold long. 800-25-99-231-800-25-99-231. Will Hillary make it to the debate? Will she?
[36:02.860 --> 36:07.100]  That's a whole other area of discussion. What excuse will she have? A big false flag attack
[36:07.100 --> 36:12.020]  in New York? Notice the first debate was set to be in New York and now there's been terror
[36:12.020 --> 36:18.740]  attacks and terror cells. Okay, I'm not saying that's what's happening. I'm just trying to
[36:18.740 --> 36:24.580]  war game this. Will a new war start? I mean, who knows what they'll pull because she's
[36:24.580 --> 36:30.740]  got the president, her crime syndicate that she represents the next row of shark teeth
[36:30.740 --> 36:36.820]  to come into office. They'll do anything. Roger Stone, the article's up on infowars.com,
[36:36.820 --> 36:41.860]  says the Democrats are in total panic mode, more dangerous than they've ever been. And
[36:41.860 --> 36:47.340]  I absolutely concur with him. So will she make it? If she doesn't make it, what's the
[36:47.340 --> 36:54.500]  excuse? We may be about to see her admit. You know what? The wild card is she can tell
[36:54.500 --> 36:59.980]  the truth and say, you know what? I really do have an illness. This is how she'd spend
[36:59.980 --> 37:03.660]  it. I didn't think it was as bad as it was. I thought it would get better. It hasn't.
[37:03.660 --> 37:09.220]  I have a brain tumor that's returning. And so I would like you to put me into office
[37:09.220 --> 37:12.900]  as the first woman and I'll try to live a few years, maybe longer, but the prognosis
[37:12.900 --> 37:16.860]  isn't good. And then Mr. Kate and others will carry on because we know Trump's evil. She
[37:16.860 --> 37:24.220]  could get it on the sympathy vote. But it's not fake. She's sick. She looks like death
[37:24.220 --> 37:30.460]  warmed over. I'm working in this here and you notice how many times we work in something.
[37:30.460 --> 37:34.860]  It turns out to be right because our brains are just as good as theirs. Let's look at every
[37:34.860 --> 37:40.300]  angle. This is the $64 trillion question. Does she show up? If she doesn't, what does
[37:40.300 --> 37:48.860]  she pull to get out of it? Think about it. War game at every angle. And then if she does
[37:48.860 --> 37:54.780]  show up, she's going to be heavily drugged, all frumpy, come out, look like she's asleep,
[37:54.780 --> 38:00.180]  try to open her eyes and then just go through her talking points. What is that going to
[38:00.180 --> 38:11.100]  be like with Donald Trump, the golden toad with, you know, 170 IQ and the street smarts
[38:11.100 --> 38:23.300]  of Godzilla? What's going to happen? It's going to be historical. It's going to be legendary.
[38:23.300 --> 38:28.540]  I'll never forget working in talk radio stations here in Texas and seeing people so excited
[38:28.540 --> 38:33.660]  for months before the Super Bowl and the playoffs. Oh, the anticipation. Alex, we've got tickets.
[38:33.660 --> 38:36.860]  You know, you say you're not into football, but I come on, man, we got tickets. We're
[38:36.860 --> 38:40.300]  going on a plane this weekend. I mean, it's the playoffs, man. There's going to be some
[38:40.300 --> 38:44.460]  hot girls there. Come on, man. And I'm like, listen, I'm going to stay behind and hike
[38:44.460 --> 38:49.140]  on the green belt and take my girlfriend out. I'm just not into, man, something's wrong
[38:49.140 --> 38:53.340]  with you, dude. We got tickets. We're going to be at the Jameson's table. The Jameson's
[38:53.340 --> 38:56.940]  is paying for the whole number one time. They're paying for our hotels. We're going to get the
[38:56.940 --> 39:00.940]  Jameson's table broadcast and come on with us. Hell, you can talk about politics while
[39:00.940 --> 39:09.100]  we're covered. It's going to be a party. Zero interest. I've got so much anticipation on
[39:09.100 --> 39:16.340]  this election, these debates. I work a good 14 hours a day. I go home at four or five
[39:16.340 --> 39:20.500]  o'clock, six o'clock, seven o'clock, do more work, get up six in the morning, add up at
[39:20.500 --> 39:24.220]  four 30 in the morning this morning, did, did research and just got more and more wound
[39:24.220 --> 39:30.220]  up until I got here about an hour before showtime and I wanted to shoot a few videos and a few
[39:30.220 --> 39:39.140]  promos and things. And I was bouncing off the walls and I am even foregoing coffee in
[39:39.140 --> 39:44.900]  the morning now to try to stop this energy level I've got now. I've even stopped taking
[39:44.900 --> 39:50.980]  brain force. It isn't stopping. I think I'm going to explode or something. I can't stand
[39:50.980 --> 39:55.980]  it quite frankly. It's the energy level though. And I know everybody else can feel it. Wow.
[39:55.980 --> 39:59.580]  So that's the other thing you can call in on because we're, you know, we're doing not
[39:59.580 --> 40:03.380]  screen calls, but we're on topic here is what I'm saying. Screen calls, but do you agree?
[40:03.380 --> 40:06.380]  Do you disagree? Blah, blah, blah, then you know, kick you off. You don't agree or whatever.
[40:06.380 --> 40:09.900]  No, if you disagree with me, I'd love to hear from you as well, but it's, but it's on topic.
[40:09.900 --> 40:14.220]  Will she show up if she doesn't? What's the excuse? And will she make it without coughing?
[40:14.220 --> 40:24.900]  I give that 99% no way. And then if she makes it on stage, will she fall out? I give it
[40:24.900 --> 40:30.100]  about a 40, 50% chance she's going to have to be helped and it's going to have trouble
[40:30.100 --> 40:34.500]  standing. You know what? They're not going to risk this. I don't think she's going to
[40:34.500 --> 40:39.260]  make it. I don't think she's going to make it. I don't think she's going to make it.
[40:39.260 --> 40:43.460]  We should tweet that out and ask the folks on Twitter, do you think Hillary will actually
[40:43.460 --> 40:49.780]  make this debate? And if she does, can't, will she make it through it? I mean, I would
[40:49.780 --> 40:52.620]  be nervous getting on the stage for 90 minutes in front of a hundred million people with
[40:52.620 --> 40:59.380]  Donald Trump seasoned, seasoned media journalist, you know, would be obviously having some butterflies
[40:59.380 --> 41:04.620]  here. This isn't just your ordinary event. She's going to get on the stage with Donald
[41:04.620 --> 41:12.940]  Trump. When the stress goes up, he only gets better. I've seen it with my own eyes in person.
[41:12.940 --> 41:24.300]  So, legendary, historic, ultra epic, over the top important, don't want to miss it.
[41:24.300 --> 41:29.780]  Edge of your seat doesn't even bring you one-tenth of the way there. I mean, how do I find in
[41:29.780 --> 41:45.420]  the semantical Phasaurus lexicon of verbiage, the proper colloquial twist on the nomenclature
[41:45.420 --> 41:55.060]  of hype when you can't hype something like this because it's already too important? So,
[41:55.060 --> 42:00.540]  how big do you call this debate? Or am I wrong? 800-25-99-231. We have loaded phones. I want
[42:00.540 --> 42:06.420]  to play the world government clip. But first, we have, we normally, in the last few years,
[42:06.420 --> 42:11.540]  basically double our audience every year on VisitStimpfulWars.com. And the web more and
[42:11.540 --> 42:15.140]  more is not about just your website. It's about your apps and your Facebook and your
[42:15.140 --> 42:19.940]  Twitter and all your other platforms. But all of our platforms together, we have been
[42:19.940 --> 42:23.980]  back almost, almost doubling the audience on the Internet every year. On terrestrial
[42:23.980 --> 42:27.380]  talk radio, it grows a little because we get some bigger stations, but it never gets above
[42:27.380 --> 42:36.500]  200 stations. But it's grown quite a bit, but maybe 20, 30% a year. Which is good. It
[42:36.500 --> 42:40.460]  shows people are waking up, look at the Trump phenomenon, look at nationalism in Russia,
[42:40.460 --> 42:46.300]  nationalism in the UK, in Jolly Old England. We're all riding a wave of awakening. This
[42:46.300 --> 42:50.580]  is very exciting. And obviously, infowars.com and thrudgerport.com and worldentdaily.com
[42:50.580 --> 42:54.020]  and others have been right at the heart of that, Ron Paul and others, from the beginning.
[42:54.020 --> 42:58.500]  You, the listeners of the show, are Americana. You are the global 1776 resistance. I don't
[42:58.500 --> 43:03.060]  care where you are, whether you're in Africa or Latin America or Asia or Europe or, I salute
[43:03.060 --> 43:08.820]  you. I'm humbled to be here. I, I, I try to do the best job I can, but, but I love you
[43:08.820 --> 43:15.220]  and I appreciate you. The problem is that the world economy is so bad that as our audience
[43:15.220 --> 43:18.820]  goes straight up until about six, seven years ago, as audience went up, revenue went up.
[43:18.820 --> 43:23.100]  And then it was about five, six, seven years ago, audience was going up, but revenue wasn't.
[43:23.100 --> 43:27.300]  I just had to get better at raising it and more into marketing, something I never really
[43:27.300 --> 43:31.540]  focused on. I would just do the minimum to get the money in and then stop the amount
[43:31.540 --> 43:36.100]  of money I blew, not at plugging years ago. When people had money, I would have put it
[43:36.100 --> 43:41.260]  and saved it, built stuff. And now, but look, it's all in God's plan. The point is, is that
[43:41.260 --> 43:46.900]  the audience is now not going up by 90% a year this year, probably because the election
[43:46.900 --> 43:56.180]  obviously with other factors, 300% internet increase, 300%, you know, 300%. 100% of that's
[43:56.180 --> 43:59.820]  drudge linking to us more. We're very thankful to Matt Drudge and, but he knows we're all
[43:59.820 --> 44:03.060]  in this together. I mean, if we don't fix this, we're all screwed. We're all bailing
[44:03.060 --> 44:07.940]  water. He goes, Hey, don't think me bail, bail, bail, get the land. I mean, I get it,
[44:07.940 --> 44:13.380]  but we need financial support. That's the area where audience goes straight up. A little
[44:13.380 --> 44:16.860]  bit extra revenue comes in a higher, a few people. I do this, I do that, but it's just
[44:16.860 --> 44:21.460]  not there. It's, I mean, right now, especially the last month, um, we've not been bringing
[44:21.460 --> 44:24.940]  in the money we even need to operate at this level. Now I'm like a squirrel. I've put nuts
[44:24.940 --> 44:28.940]  away, but I can see into the future. We need to raise more money. So listen, we've got
[44:28.940 --> 44:33.620]  the very best products, things you need, nutraceuticals, gravity fed, water filtration systems, systems
[44:33.620 --> 44:39.900]  for your shower heads, non GMO heirloom, open pollinated seeds, incredible supplements,
[44:39.900 --> 44:45.020]  nutraceuticals at info wars, life.com info wars store.com is the umbrella site. We have
[44:45.020 --> 44:50.140]  amazing Hillers for prison shirts. Uh, we've got 20% off the highest quality methylcobalamin
[44:50.140 --> 44:54.800]  organic, absorbable vitamin B12 that you take under the tongue. It's a liquid. The best
[44:54.800 --> 44:58.940]  from our research are going to find that's 20% off. It's a new special. Uh, but they
[44:58.940 --> 45:02.180]  came into me this morning. They said, listen, the only thing selling and floating the boat
[45:02.180 --> 45:06.420]  right now is super male vitality. That would just people really use it. They love it.
[45:06.420 --> 45:09.260]  Folks know they're getting paid today and tomorrow. We've had hundreds of emails saying,
[45:09.260 --> 45:13.820]  please extend the sale. Hey, fine. I'll just permanently lower the price 20%. Okay. The
[45:13.820 --> 45:17.900]  next people buy more of it to fund our operation. It's just very expensive to make as it's cold
[45:17.900 --> 45:23.540]  pressed. People love it. So I'll just extend it. I'll send it through next Monday and just
[45:23.540 --> 45:28.380]  hope that more people order it so we don't lose money. But you, you, you know, you take
[45:28.380 --> 45:32.980]  it in the morning, take it at night, put it under your tongue, absorb it, stamina, energy,
[45:32.980 --> 45:37.420]  libido, it's just a whole bunch of known, healthy concentrated herbs into an oil form
[45:37.420 --> 45:42.820]  cold press. So it keeps its key essence. We have female vitality as well. I don't ask
[45:42.820 --> 45:46.020]  me why I guess most of the audience is mainly male. I don't know why we don't sell as much
[45:46.020 --> 45:50.100]  as the female because quite frankly, whether a female takes male or female, the female
[45:50.100 --> 45:55.660]  formula is just a little bit different. That's where you really see effects in certain areas.
[45:55.660 --> 45:59.340]  I'm just going to stop right there. I mean, this gets guys going a little bit women. It's
[45:59.340 --> 46:06.940]  a dramatic, dramatic. And I'm here to tell you, so that's not why we sell it. That's
[46:06.940 --> 46:11.780]  not even the angle. It's just that's what everybody notices. That's what's in the reviews.
[46:11.780 --> 46:16.420]  And so we have bio true selenium that sold out a little bit more came in from the mustard
[46:16.420 --> 46:25.460]  seed that funds our operation info wars life.com or cultural free 888-253-3139. But I got to
[46:25.460 --> 46:29.220]  tell you, the economy must just be absolutely destroyed. I mean, just the amount of traffic
[46:29.220 --> 46:34.500]  is just exponentially higher. But it's like water, water everywhere, not a drop to drink.
[46:34.500 --> 46:38.300]  All right, I want to go to your phone calls now. We don't have any guests today. I want
[46:38.300 --> 46:42.340]  to clear the decks and be able to take your phone calls. We've got just huge amounts of
[46:42.340 --> 46:49.260]  news, huge amounts of different clips I want to play. There is just so much coming up.
[46:49.260 --> 46:54.300]  But I hate to take my horn. I mean, I just have a good estimation. It's just common sense
[46:54.300 --> 46:59.660]  looking at all the interest there is in this election and how the other debates, you know,
[46:59.660 --> 47:02.860]  we're getting three, four times the viewers that they used to, you know, 20, 30 million.
[47:02.860 --> 47:07.700]  Of course, the first debate with Hillary 90 minutes, I don't think it's going to be 100
[47:07.700 --> 47:10.860]  million. I'm predicting, because I'd said it'd be as big as a Superbowl or bicker. I
[47:10.860 --> 47:13.460]  said 70, 80 million a few weeks ago. But the more I think about this, because there's
[47:13.460 --> 47:17.140]  not one network carrying it, so they can suppress it and not let it get out because
[47:17.140 --> 47:22.900]  they're doing it right. Just having a university feed for everybody. I think that you'll first
[47:22.900 --> 47:26.980]  hear over 100 million in the US and then hundreds of millions worldwide. And then you're going
[47:26.980 --> 47:29.780]  to see numbers once the internet numbers come in a few days later. I think you're going
[47:29.780 --> 47:35.460]  to hear that 500 million, maybe a billion. Who knows? I think 500 million people are
[47:35.460 --> 47:40.340]  going to watch it live, more than the population of the US. And I think you're going to end
[47:40.340 --> 47:45.740]  up having probably a billion worldwide watch it in the week after. And if she falls out
[47:45.740 --> 47:52.460]  during this thing, I'm telling you, this is epic. The arrogance, the bravado, the hutzpah,
[47:52.460 --> 48:00.660]  the false aplomb that she has when she knows she's sick. I mean, again, we told you five
[48:00.660 --> 48:05.940]  weeks ago, Hillary Clinton is falling over every 30, 40 minutes, sometimes 15 minutes.
[48:05.940 --> 48:09.380]  They're like, what has she got? We think epilepsy, obviously, we don't know what the
[48:09.380 --> 48:14.260]  Parkinson's brain tumors is. Do you know? All we know is they're very secretive about
[48:14.260 --> 48:20.660]  it. And they're talking about some big announcement if it gets worse. Four weeks later, she fell
[48:20.660 --> 48:24.580]  down, folks. It's like we told you, we told you, she does like this in a circle and then
[48:24.580 --> 48:29.180]  falls down. That's why they got to have people beside her at all times. For the last year,
[48:29.180 --> 48:32.700]  everywhere she goes, people stand right beside her and they're ready. They're watching her.
[48:32.700 --> 48:38.100]  She's stepping. She's being careful because this is serious and stress is what brings
[48:38.100 --> 48:43.860]  on a lot of these seizures. In fact, I remember seeing my uncle one time arguing, he's been
[48:43.860 --> 48:49.020]  married a few times with one of his wives, not even meanly. And he, and if she's ready,
[48:49.020 --> 48:54.180]  boy, he all of a sudden had a seizure five months later. And, and imagine, you go up
[48:54.180 --> 48:59.020]  and Donald Trump with a hundred billion people watching live. I mean, she is going down and
[48:59.020 --> 49:01.940]  they've taught her when she starts having the seizures, you know, just, you know, the
[49:01.940 --> 49:05.860]  lighter baby seizures, just act like it's fun, act like it's cute, just kind of go through
[49:05.860 --> 49:10.460]  it, be calm. But you look at her, she's clearly not there. And then, and then a few days ago,
[49:10.460 --> 49:15.420]  she gave the speech for 15 minutes and her eyes weren't pointing the right direction.
[49:15.420 --> 49:21.780]  That video is up on info wars.com. And what happened? She then canceled all these events
[49:21.780 --> 49:26.260]  this week ahead of Monday. She's in bed getting special drugs, you name it, trying to get
[49:26.260 --> 49:31.900]  ready. Oh, this, oh my God, this political enemy of all of free humanity, this, this
[49:31.900 --> 49:37.420]  monster, this Medusa is falling in front of us and it's, it's edge of your seat. I don't
[49:37.420 --> 49:40.820]  know what's going to come out of this. There's so many angles. There's so many things that
[49:40.820 --> 49:44.820]  can happen. But I want to go to break with Obama and then come back directly to your
[49:44.820 --> 49:50.500]  calls talking about world government and Americans needing to basically accept it. Now this
[49:50.500 --> 49:55.260]  is a 51 second clip Obama submit to world government. I'm out of show. We have to put
[49:55.260 --> 50:07.500]  our money. Let's start over. We have to put our money where our mouths are. We can only
[50:07.500 --> 50:13.300]  realize the promise of this institution's founding to replace the ravages of war with
[50:13.300 --> 50:23.260]  cooperation. If powerful nations like my own accept constraints. Sometimes I'm criticized
[50:23.260 --> 50:29.540]  in my own country. Oh, for professing a belief in international norms. He's getting ready
[50:29.540 --> 50:33.980]  to be the global natural institutions, but I am convinced that in the long run, giving
[50:33.980 --> 50:42.140]  up some freedom of action, not giving up our ability to protect ourselves, give up sovereignty,
[50:42.140 --> 50:47.700]  but binding ourselves to international rules. Get this break. I can't help it over the long
[50:47.700 --> 50:51.660]  term enhances our security. Yeah, start this over. Back it up again because I don't want
[50:51.660 --> 50:58.540]  to have to put our money. This is so mega epic this 51 second clip that again you could
[50:58.540 --> 51:04.860]  teach a college course on treason on treachery on subterfuge on infiltration. We as a culture
[51:04.860 --> 51:11.180]  in a society are designed to battle men in uniforms attacking us with their flags. We
[51:11.180 --> 51:18.740]  know what's going on. There's rules to war. But the British in the last 300 400 years
[51:18.740 --> 51:24.260]  started using corporate ways to take over countries with the British East India Company.
[51:24.260 --> 51:28.540]  Then it merged with the Dutch British East India Company. And I've probably read I'm
[51:28.540 --> 51:33.020]  not bragging. I'm just like, you know, I am a scholar. Most professors that, you know,
[51:33.020 --> 51:40.980]  claim they teach those periods of history. I bet you haven't read 20 books on India and
[51:40.980 --> 51:44.780]  the British East India Company and how the Brits controlled them with the great game.
[51:44.780 --> 51:52.020]  I have probably read 50 on that alone because I used to be a selfish person. I love history.
[51:52.020 --> 51:58.660]  I used to read a history book almost every day like a pig from high school right through
[51:58.660 --> 52:03.980]  to about five years into media. I would just go do my show once a day, do a few things,
[52:03.980 --> 52:07.380]  work on a film, you know, I worked eight hours, nine hours a day, but I just never saw myself
[52:07.380 --> 52:11.780]  as being this big shot. So I would go home and I wouldn't watch TV if I wasn't taking
[52:11.780 --> 52:16.900]  my girlfriend out or going for a hike or whatever. I would read a history book. I'd
[52:16.900 --> 52:21.740]  look up and be two, three a.m. in the morning. I'd put another big, fat, juicy history book
[52:21.740 --> 52:26.980]  down that I got at the library. And I don't mean to digress. It's just that what you're
[52:26.980 --> 52:31.460]  witnessing is the British government model of corporately taking over your government.
[52:31.460 --> 52:35.380]  They did it starting in 1922 at Pratt House, the Council on Fine Relations in New York
[52:35.380 --> 52:39.580]  City. And when I say the Brits taking over, I mean a model of corporate control. The Brits
[52:39.580 --> 52:43.420]  are the biggest slaves out there, great people, but absolutely enslaved. Their sovereignty
[52:43.420 --> 52:47.860]  being destroyed. The New World Order, George Soros hates them. So when you hear him get
[52:47.860 --> 52:52.260]  up there and say, we have to give up some of our sovereignty for this world, and he's
[52:52.260 --> 52:57.300]  quote being criticized because he pushes that they've gone from denying all of this to admitting
[52:57.300 --> 53:02.500]  it and saying we need a quote liberal New World Order. That was in the full speech.
[53:02.500 --> 53:08.220]  I should do a special report just on this treason of speech yesterday. But you notice
[53:08.220 --> 53:13.500]  he is out there like a prostitute shaking his ass on the street corner, you know, to
[53:13.500 --> 53:20.700]  the Johns driving by saying, love you long time, you know, not to boo coo. He is, he
[53:20.700 --> 53:25.940]  is over there on the street corner shaking his butt in front of the globalists, everybody
[53:25.940 --> 53:30.380]  prostrating himself and us at the knees of the mega corporations that have looted the
[53:30.380 --> 53:35.940]  third world saying, I want to be the Secretary General of the UN. I want to be the head of
[53:35.940 --> 53:39.180]  the Davos group. I want to be the head of the Bilderberg group. I want to be the head
[53:39.180 --> 53:43.340]  of the IMF World Bank. I want to graduate to that next level. I've spent my whole life
[53:43.340 --> 53:49.060]  transferring American power into this global government body. And now I want to go to the
[53:49.060 --> 53:53.860]  next level. He is, you know, one last stick in the eye of the American people. Notice
[53:53.860 --> 53:58.300]  he says this UN building was founded, yeah, by the Rockefellers. It's their land. They
[53:58.300 --> 54:02.460]  gave the money, the most evil, heartable people you could ever imagine setting up a corporate
[54:02.460 --> 54:08.620]  world government for themselves. So do we get apologies on this when we're proving right
[54:08.620 --> 54:15.940]  again? Just like we're proving right on everything else, basically. I wasn't proving right. Rockefeller
[54:15.940 --> 54:23.420]  wrote books bragging about it. Dave Rockefeller wrote a book seven, eight years ago admitting
[54:23.420 --> 54:28.900]  he's setting up world government. I'd like to be able to take credit for all this, but
[54:28.900 --> 54:34.780]  I didn't. Let's go ahead and take a call. Let's talk to Frank in Maryland. Frank, you're
[54:34.780 --> 54:42.340]  on the air. Go ahead. Hello? Yeah, it's trying to radio off. Sorry, I'm going to try to
[54:42.340 --> 54:53.940]  break it off. Please go. You go. Good. Hello? Yeah. Go ahead. Good. Yes. Love it. Obama
[54:53.940 --> 55:00.620]  pisses me off. I'm sorry. I love you, Frank. Go ahead. Yeah. Yeah. Um, you know, they were
[55:00.620 --> 55:04.980]  complaining about debates being too long before, but now let's have a three hour debate and
[55:04.980 --> 55:11.980]  see who can stand and withstand the whole time there. I agree. Hey, Ted Cruz, man, 26
[55:11.980 --> 55:18.940]  hour filibuster. I couldn't do that. How about? Sorry. I pushed it out there. She's not going
[55:18.940 --> 55:24.260]  to want to do it. Well, he pushed it out there and when she denies it, you know, then, then
[55:24.260 --> 55:29.780]  she'll, she'll steam week. I mean, she knows she can't do it. You are such a genius, Frank.
[55:29.780 --> 55:33.660]  That's a great idea. Trump ought to challenge her to a three hour debate, an hour and a
[55:33.660 --> 55:36.900]  half of them talking and then an hour and a half of questions. Since she's so scared
[55:36.900 --> 55:42.540]  of press conferences, you're a genius, Frank. All he has to do is relax and sit back. I
[55:42.540 --> 55:46.260]  mean, even if you make some mistakes, it doesn't matter. I mean, she's gonna, you know, even
[55:46.260 --> 55:50.420]  if she stands the whole time, he's still going to look bad for her. Plus she's so, she's
[55:50.420 --> 55:54.060]  so incredibly sexy. I want to look at her a little bit more.
[55:54.060 --> 56:01.620]  Frank, I want you to know one of my greatest pitfalls is you get like a pet peeve over the
[56:01.620 --> 56:05.380]  years of thousands of calls with the radio on. I apologize. I was being a jerk earlier
[56:05.380 --> 56:10.500]  and I, and I, and I appreciate you. And that's a great point you made though. And it's absolutely
[56:10.500 --> 56:15.500]  central. But how do you deal with it? I get so mad at Obama and the globalists and Hillary
[56:15.500 --> 56:19.540]  that my anger spills over my everyday life, watching this treason. How do you deal with
[56:19.540 --> 56:24.540]  that? Because that's, that's my biggest problem is I'm so pissed off at them. I guess I care
[56:24.540 --> 56:28.140]  too much. I mean, how do I turn it off and not care? Can you tell me that?
[56:28.140 --> 56:35.260]  No, I wouldn't go home. Trust me in like listening to you and your supporters. And it was hard
[56:35.260 --> 56:40.460]  to go through that. Your supporters helped me through that. And let me tell you, all
[56:40.460 --> 56:46.220]  I realized is good is going to win. They're going to be bad. There's no going to be bad
[56:46.220 --> 56:52.580]  out there. I met the two evil people that I know as friends, whoever. It doesn't matter.
[56:52.580 --> 56:53.580]  You find the good.
[56:53.580 --> 56:58.580]  Absolutely. And I agree with you. Look at Hillary collapsing. Look at the Brexit. Look at globalism
[56:58.580 --> 57:02.980]  and trouble. Look at Russia getting out from under it. The evil isn't invincible. It's
[57:02.980 --> 57:06.900]  not invincible. It's always, you know, more and more horrible until the dawn actually
[57:06.900 --> 57:10.860]  gets there. And you're absolutely right. I think what I got from what you said was that,
[57:10.860 --> 57:13.900]  hey, look, we're going to make it through this.
[57:13.900 --> 57:20.060]  It was just an angel, man. Yeah, that's all it was, man. It's not, if you don't want to
[57:20.060 --> 57:26.620]  believe in that, that's fine. Just an angel. Let me conquer something that he didn't conquer.
[57:26.620 --> 57:31.460]  And that's how it is. It's going to keep losing. People get better in life and people
[57:31.460 --> 57:37.100]  can't feel helpless about that. Doing gotten better in this country. I mean, it's not a
[57:37.100 --> 57:40.100]  bad country. I mean, no, it's not. We have bad people that have hijacked it. Frank, I
[57:40.100 --> 57:44.740]  got to jump, you know, just just over the years. Talk about pet peeves. That guy was
[57:44.740 --> 57:48.740]  making right points. But then you hear how his phone goes in and out. You can't understand
[57:48.740 --> 57:52.140]  it. So you sit there trying to understand what he's saying. And then when you understand
[57:52.140 --> 57:55.180]  it, it's like, Oh, that made sense. And then you can understand it for five seconds. And
[57:55.180 --> 58:00.460]  then, Oh, that made sense. And it just becomes torture because you want to hear the caller.
[58:00.460 --> 58:04.340]  You want to hear the great things they have to say. But then you wonder, they're going
[58:04.340 --> 58:08.260]  to have their radio up. They're going to say hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, over and
[58:08.260 --> 58:12.460]  over again to you. And then their phones are going to start going in and out. And then
[58:12.460 --> 58:15.460]  you think, you know, I'm supposed to be a tough guy. I should be able to handle this.
[58:15.460 --> 58:23.980]  It's 20 plus years of it. It starts to get to you. Maybe what's happening is the veneer
[58:23.980 --> 58:28.500]  of civilization is peeling away for all of us. But the globalist for the average person,
[58:28.500 --> 58:34.100]  you name it, a quickening is happening. Judgment Day, the hand of doom, but also the hand of

[58:48.060 --> 59:05.780]  Thank you, brother. Thank you guys for putting those out there. I am a relatively short time
[59:05.780 --> 59:11.820]  listener and a quite a supporter of your fine, fine products. Welcome to the info war. It's

[59:16.380 --> 59:21.380]  at the same time. I'm a nine year listener by all the nutraceuticals.cofx, nason i9.
[59:21.380 --> 59:25.260]  Why? Let me ask you a question. Have they worked for you? They're the most unbelievable
[59:25.260 --> 59:29.980]  products I've ever had in my life. What products are you taking? Everything from Super
[59:29.980 --> 59:37.180]  Male to Brain Force to Winter Sun, X2, even got a little DNA force. So when I just free
[59:37.180 --> 59:42.740]  up everything and I just went to autoville. Visit infowarslife.com to read the information
[59:42.740 --> 59:53.620]  and research and to see the reviews for yourself. That's infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[59:53.620 --> 01:00:21.100]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show. You are listening to the Alex Jones show. You
[01:00:21.100 --> 01:00:28.940]  are listening to a fire breathing patriot, completely uncontrolled, teleprompter free,
[01:00:28.940 --> 01:00:39.100]  the opposite of polished, the opposite of cool. So I'm just here to put some action
[01:00:39.100 --> 01:00:45.420]  in my life. I'm here to tell you what happens when they break the law so much that not breaking
[01:00:45.420 --> 01:00:51.580]  the law becomes criminal. But the too big to fail corruption spreads so horribly that
[01:00:51.580 --> 01:00:56.480]  there seems to be no end to it. But instead of civilization collapsing as it's done before
[01:00:56.480 --> 01:01:01.420]  and giving us a reprieve from the tyrants, even though it's a painful reprieve, it's
[01:01:01.420 --> 01:01:09.380]  better than tyranny and the engine of dehumanization that follows the great battering ram of dehumanization.
[01:01:09.380 --> 01:01:15.700]  But what happens when technocracy can hold up the false reality? Humanity will now be
[01:01:15.700 --> 01:01:21.300]  taken into realms of which we have never experienced. I want to take a lot of your phone calls this
[01:01:21.300 --> 01:01:25.260]  hour. I took one call last hour, so I'm not doing too well. I'm going to try to take as
[01:01:25.260 --> 01:01:28.980]  many of your calls as I can if you just joined us. Hillary sets a debate. Donald Trump for
[01:01:28.980 --> 01:01:33.340]  90 minutes next week. Can she make it? Will she show up? Will she be there? Will she have
[01:01:33.340 --> 01:01:38.260]  a coughing fit? Will she collapse? That's three different bets, isn't it? Will she make it?
[01:01:38.260 --> 01:01:42.980]  Will she show up? That's one. Another bet, I guess there's four, is what will her stunt
[01:01:42.980 --> 01:01:47.660]  be if she doesn't show up? Three, will she have a coughing fit or will she completely
[01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:56.540]  collapse? Or five, will she have to delay it for 20 or 30 minutes? I mean, how are they
[01:01:56.540 --> 01:02:03.180]  going to pull this off? This is like 50 times worse than I was like six years old and still
[01:02:03.180 --> 01:02:07.060]  cared about Christmas. You're three months out from Christmas and you're already hearing
[01:02:07.060 --> 01:02:11.140]  Christmas music, but you want to know when you're going to get the presents. I mean,
[01:02:11.140 --> 01:02:17.060]  this is torture, but in a good way. How could anybody say they're bored? We're going to
[01:02:17.060 --> 01:02:24.740]  Eric, Michael, George, Clifford, Scott, and many others. Let's go to Eric in California.
[01:02:24.740 --> 01:02:32.260]  Eric, thanks for calling. Yeah, how are you doing? Good, sir. She needs brain force or
[01:02:32.260 --> 01:02:41.180]  female vitality. First of all, second of all, you know, she does make it. Trump is going
[01:02:41.180 --> 01:02:47.700]  to chew her up. So she might collapse because Trump is going to eat her up so bad. And she
[01:02:47.700 --> 01:02:54.420]  probably right now resting, highly drugged up, you know, getting ready. But honestly,
[01:02:54.420 --> 01:02:57.860]  they might know something is coming. So we might not even make it to the debate. You
[01:02:57.860 --> 01:03:03.580]  know what I mean? I agree. They've got CNN, you know, writers saying something's big coming
[01:03:03.580 --> 01:03:07.540]  that nothing will matter soon. So don't worry, Trump people, you think you're going to win?
[01:03:07.540 --> 01:03:11.420]  Oh, yeah. Wait, when the big thing happens in the next month, we're like, well, what
[01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:16.760]  is it? Yeah. And then somebody needs to bring George
[01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:22.220]  Snow's with Dr. You know, because he's getting real serious. He's been caught right handed.
[01:03:22.220 --> 01:03:27.460]  And it's that series, you know, it's like, I don't understand the people in power, Obama
[01:03:27.460 --> 01:03:30.820]  and all these other people that make they're talking about everything except for what was
[01:03:30.820 --> 01:03:34.980]  real, you know? And did you hear that clip earlier of Obama saying America's got to give
[01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:39.860]  up sovereignty at the UN? That's what I'm saying. They're giving away the internet and
[01:03:39.860 --> 01:03:43.940]  all this. Everybody's sitting around praising this man. And he's giving away the government.
[01:03:43.940 --> 01:03:48.140]  I mean, that's exactly, exactly. That's why I feel so crazy right now because I can't
[01:03:48.140 --> 01:03:55.460]  cover it all. Nine days from now, they hand the internet over to the UN. So, you know,
[01:03:55.460 --> 01:03:59.260]  I just, I just, I'm feeling really some type of way about all this and I wish I had more
[01:03:59.260 --> 01:04:03.100]  power to be able to do something all I could do is, you know, try to change people's minds
[01:04:03.100 --> 01:04:08.460]  that are that's an important question, Eric. Are you feeling what I'm feeling?
[01:04:08.460 --> 01:04:12.460]  Definitely. Definitely. I'm, I'm, I'm, I go to a therapist and tell my therapist all
[01:04:12.460 --> 01:04:18.100]  this. I got high anxiety because all this, you know, and by the way, statistics show
[01:04:18.100 --> 01:04:21.060]  people that don't listen to this show and people that aren't politically involved,
[01:04:21.060 --> 01:04:25.300]  they're having the highest anxiety of anybody. So it's not just us. The whole world is
[01:04:25.300 --> 01:04:30.260]  picking up on the stuff that's going on. We are on the edge of, of just incredibly bad
[01:04:30.260 --> 01:04:34.460]  things happening. Almost all the honeybees are dying. All these wars are getting started.
[01:04:34.460 --> 01:04:38.380]  We're run by crazy people. Debt bubbles are about to implode. The German government says
[01:04:38.380 --> 01:04:42.900]  get ready for collapse. I don't know. I don't know what's coming, but my gut level
[01:04:42.900 --> 01:04:49.020]  instinct's never been wrong and it's on fire right now. I have never felt like this. Okay.
[01:04:49.020 --> 01:04:53.620]  In 20 plus years on air, I have never felt this concerned. We're going to take more
[01:04:53.620 --> 01:04:56.460]  of your calls straight ahead. Great point, Eric. You're awesome. We'll be back. Thanks
[01:04:56.460 --> 01:05:23.180]  for calling Billionaire George Soros has given yet another massive lump sum to Hillary Clinton.
[01:05:23.180 --> 01:05:29.180]  He's given at least 10.5 million along with George Soros to Priorities USA. Priorities
[01:05:29.180 --> 01:05:34.140]  USA is the group that has unreserved more than 150 million in advertising cash to help
[01:05:34.140 --> 01:05:38.300]  Clinton win the election. This news comes as the Clinton Foundation is planning to drop
[01:05:38.300 --> 01:05:44.020]  dozens of employees like flies from its payroll, saying that they're closing many of its operations.
[01:05:44.020 --> 01:05:48.180]  Politico reports that two former Clinton Foundation officials will remain on their communication
[01:05:48.180 --> 01:05:52.580]  staff. The Clintons are shutting down their controversial cartel and severing many of
[01:05:52.580 --> 01:05:57.620]  its personal ties, still using primary donors like Soros to continue funding Clinton. I'm

[01:08:20.540 --> 01:08:30.340]  All right, here's a big question. Will Hillary Clinton come in and try to suspend the debate
[01:08:30.340 --> 01:08:34.780]  next week where she's going to be head to head with Donald Trump for 90 minutes from
[01:08:34.780 --> 01:08:38.660]  8 o'clock central to 9.30 central. We're going to be here covering it live with the
[01:08:38.660 --> 01:08:42.940]  actual feed because now it's open to the public. Anybody can get the feed from the university.
[01:08:42.940 --> 01:08:45.420]  We're going to be carrying it, so it won't be us talking over it the whole time, but
[01:08:45.420 --> 01:08:49.540]  us, that's how we're able to carry other debates because we have analysis and critique
[01:08:49.540 --> 01:08:54.500]  on it. We'll do that for a couple of hours after the debate and take your calls and also
[01:08:54.500 --> 01:08:59.540]  for an hour before the debate. But my big question is, will Hillary even make it to
[01:08:59.540 --> 01:09:05.420]  the debate? And if she does, will she fall down? Or will she have another coughing fit?
[01:09:05.420 --> 01:09:15.340]  Now, there's a new story up on InfoWars.com that is extremely important. It is red-linked.
[01:09:15.340 --> 01:09:22.580]  And it's an article by Paul Joseph Watson. Alert, the October surprise will be a violent
[01:09:22.580 --> 01:09:29.500]  provocation blamed on Trump. Hillary is desperate and will resort to dirty tricks. You're also
[01:09:29.500 --> 01:09:36.860]  in negotiation basically with the family of Obama, the Kenyan folks that got the video
[01:09:36.860 --> 01:09:41.900]  of him visiting Kenya that's never been seen of him bad-mouthing America and white people.
[01:09:41.900 --> 01:09:47.180]  Paul Watson is in negotiation. They say they're giving it to us. That article is up on InfoWars.com.
[01:09:47.180 --> 01:09:55.140]  I mean, we're a major news source and we're a news provider and we get all these whistleblowers
[01:09:55.140 --> 01:10:00.180]  and data dumps. It makes my head spin. And by the way, I'm not complaining, but you
[01:10:00.180 --> 01:10:04.340]  heard the last caller saying he's having all this anxiety about what's happening. I am
[01:10:04.340 --> 01:10:10.900]  too, but that's normal. You have anxiety for a reason. So if you see a white van pull
[01:10:10.900 --> 01:10:14.140]  up and some guy telling your five-year-old in the backyard to get in it, you have a bunch
[01:10:14.140 --> 01:10:18.940]  of anxiety. That anxiety is to make you go out there and save your kid and probably call
[01:10:18.940 --> 01:10:25.420]  the police and you need to kick that person into next week. I mean, that's why we have
[01:10:25.420 --> 01:10:31.700]  these anxieties. And it's not just our listeners. Everybody I talk to and the studies are out.
[01:10:31.700 --> 01:10:38.780]  Times of London, New York Times, anxiety is at an all-time high in the modern world. But
[01:10:38.780 --> 01:10:43.460]  it's also an all-time high. I have an internal auditory in my head, an internal sensor. I
[01:10:43.460 --> 01:10:47.980]  don't say certain things because I know that I wouldn't last in the business for 22 years.
[01:10:47.980 --> 01:10:54.220]  I'd lose show, advertisers, you name it. So who says that religion should be protected
[01:10:54.220 --> 01:10:59.140]  100% by the First Amendment? For example, what if psychos wake up one day as they have
[01:10:59.140 --> 01:11:03.020]  and they say they're a witch and they're a religion? Well, then, hey, you got warlocks
[01:11:03.020 --> 01:11:06.820]  now practicing. Why don't you be more positive and believe good things are going to happen?
[01:11:06.820 --> 01:11:12.180]  Good things are happening because we're admitting the problems we have. If I had a skin cancer
[01:11:12.180 --> 01:11:17.300]  and denied, I think it says you can kill anyone who's not like us. Is that a religion? Sure.
[01:11:17.300 --> 01:11:21.380]  You got the protection of your religion. How about I can rape young children? Sure. It's
[01:11:21.380 --> 01:11:25.540]  a religion. No, it isn't. So in other words, if a religion woke up or created or someone
[01:11:25.540 --> 01:11:29.740]  created a religion of child molesting, everyone say, I'm sorry, that's not a religion. If
[01:11:29.740 --> 01:11:33.380]  religion said you can kill anyone who's not like you and say that's not a religion, really,
[01:11:33.380 --> 01:11:40.420]  we're looking to Islam. It says kill the infidel in about 73 different places. If you find
[01:11:40.420 --> 01:11:48.420]  the infidel slashes throat, kill the Jew, kill a Christian, kill the apostate. So I'm saying
[01:11:48.420 --> 01:11:53.780]  right now what moderate Muslims are saying, and I've had some of these people on mainly
[01:11:53.780 --> 01:11:57.820]  their women, by the way, I've often said, Alex, only the Muslim women could save us
[01:11:57.820 --> 01:12:03.340]  from these animals. It's the Muslim women who have to save us from these throwback animals.
[01:12:03.340 --> 01:12:07.300]  All the Ahmeds of the world, like the one in New Jersey, who claim their racial discrimination.
[01:12:07.300 --> 01:12:12.660]  Didn't you see that one earlier? He sued the town and the police because they dared
[01:12:12.660 --> 01:12:16.580]  say that the chicken stand that his whole family was running was causing disturbances.
[01:12:16.580 --> 01:12:20.460]  So he got probably the geniuses from NYU. And it's stunk, by the way, the doctor was
[01:12:20.460 --> 01:12:26.660]  even going, oh, but I'm telling you, it saved my life. And we're here trying to admit, hey,
[01:12:26.660 --> 01:12:32.660]  our foot's swollen. We're going to get gangrene here. We got to get the pus out. And that's
[01:12:32.660 --> 01:12:38.680]  what I'm doing. And I'm going a little crazy doing it. I'll be honest, because the energy
[01:12:38.680 --> 01:12:44.700]  level is rising, the responsibility level is rising. And for whatever amount of power
[01:12:44.700 --> 01:12:49.660]  the devil gives his people, God's giving us that much power back. And it's like tying
[01:12:49.660 --> 01:12:55.660]  into a high power tension wire. I mean, this is like, I mean, this is hard to handle. Everybody's
[01:12:55.660 --> 01:13:00.380]  who's fighting tyranny is getting the discernment, the understanding, the energy, it's all intensifying
[01:13:00.380 --> 01:13:04.740]  right now. This is a magic time to be alive, folks. This is metaphysical. What's happening?
[01:13:04.740 --> 01:13:11.540]  Don't make any mistakes about that. And it's only going to get crazier from here on out.
[01:13:11.540 --> 01:13:16.260]  I want to go to your phone calls right now. We've got George and Connecticut. I keep hearing
[01:13:16.260 --> 01:13:20.700]  most of them are peaceful. Fine. Okay, most of them are peaceful. So what is it? 1% are
[01:13:20.700 --> 01:13:26.300]  radicals? What's 1% of 700,000 rounded off? A lot of people. Oh, what 10 to do it for
[01:13:26.300 --> 01:13:32.020]  do the math fast, we should do in the fifth grade, 700,000, 10% of 70,000. 1% of 7,000
[01:13:32.020 --> 01:13:37.300]  is about 7,000 of them are now 7,000 radicals they brought in. So it's no way savage. No,
[01:13:37.300 --> 01:13:44.500]  it's not 1% of Muslims are radical. No, it's 0.1% or it's not 7,000. It's only 700. So
[01:13:44.500 --> 01:13:51.420]  they brought in 700 more terrorists. No savage. It's not 0.1%. It's 001%. All right. So it's
[01:13:51.420 --> 01:13:55.860]  not 70. It's seven. You see what I'm saying? But you still let me know the numbers. This
[01:13:55.860 --> 01:14:02.380]  latest group, decades ago, it was heretics. It was people that did actually want to live
[01:14:02.380 --> 01:14:07.060]  in a freer country in most cases, who are fleeing Islam. And we're just Islamic with
[01:14:07.060 --> 01:14:10.820]  their roots. I've studied it. I know you've studied. I've had scholars on now. It's the
[01:14:10.820 --> 01:14:16.660]  worst third world areas that they're coming out of with their and again, then the government
[01:14:16.660 --> 01:14:20.540]  takes our rights away, doesn't kick them out. People say, well, this is a false fly. The
[01:14:20.540 --> 01:14:24.100]  government's evil, Alex. Why are you saying this Islamic attacks? They're all fake. No,
[01:14:24.100 --> 01:14:29.380]  bringing them in is the, is the false flag. It's real terror grips. This is a major Islamic
[01:14:29.380 --> 01:14:36.500]  Sunni jihad worldwide. So now this is a story from the Houston Chronicle. It's posted up
[01:14:36.500 --> 01:14:42.060]  on info wars.com, Texas. God bless our governor threatens to, I don't mean the one that one
[01:14:42.060 --> 01:14:46.780]  dancing with the stars last night, Texas, though that was cute. I saw this morning, Texas threatens
[01:14:46.780 --> 01:14:54.620]  to exit the federal refugee program over terror's concerns. They won't even tell governor Abbott
[01:14:54.620 --> 01:15:00.060]  the numbers that are coming. And this is ongoing for two years. Now they've been forced at
[01:15:00.060 --> 01:15:05.020]  the state department to admit that they know terrorists are coming in. That is intentional
[01:15:05.020 --> 01:15:10.260]  harm aiding and abetting terrorists. That, that, I mean, if you were, I did that 20,
[01:15:10.260 --> 01:15:14.260]  30 years in prison, we deserve it. The government does it. Obama does it. And it's supposedly
[01:15:14.260 --> 01:15:19.260]  okay. No, it's not okay when the president commits crimes. Nixon thought that and see
[01:15:19.260 --> 01:15:25.140]  what happened to him. And boy, 20 years ago, I thought Nixon was a bad guy and he did do
[01:15:25.140 --> 01:15:29.380]  some bad stuff. And that guy was a patriot compared to what we got. He thought he was
[01:15:29.380 --> 01:15:35.300]  doing it for America. These people are doing it to intentionally screw us. So there's like
[01:15:35.300 --> 01:15:40.940]  a murder one intent. Nixon was unintentionally doing stuff that hurt the country was illegal.
[01:15:40.940 --> 01:15:47.540]  This stuff is openly flagrantly nakedly. Just, just, just, it's crazy. I mean, I'll give
[01:15:47.540 --> 01:15:53.640]  the globalists this. They are brazen. So we've got the state department admits ISIS smuggling
[01:15:53.640 --> 01:15:58.060]  in terrorist among refugees. And then we got the state department takes heat for Clinton's
[01:15:58.060 --> 01:16:02.700]  pay for place scheme where you just give them money and you get an appointment. We got Michael
[01:16:02.700 --> 01:16:06.660]  McCall, Texas Congressman admits we don't have the ability to vet refugees. We've known
[01:16:06.660 --> 01:16:10.940]  this the whole time. They don't vet them on purpose because they're Wahhabist invaders
[01:16:10.940 --> 01:16:16.300]  of Syria. They're not Syrian refugees. They're the globalist army, the Islamic globalist
[01:16:16.300 --> 01:16:24.460]  army that got its butt handed to it by the Syrians and by the Russians. Our government
[01:16:24.460 --> 01:16:29.500]  our criminal government started this six years ago. They even got that in the Snowden movie
[01:16:29.500 --> 01:16:34.300]  when they turned the power off nationwide before the Jihad attack. I tell you, this is
[01:16:34.300 --> 01:16:39.540]  sick. People around our country are really sick. There were some Christians in Syria
[01:16:39.540 --> 01:16:44.580]  though and that was the target. That doesn't make sense geopolitically. It's spiritual
[01:16:44.580 --> 01:16:48.660]  folks. When you look at money, that's how they control us. The top globalists don't
[01:16:48.660 --> 01:16:53.820]  care about money. Hillary's a minion and wants money. She's a lower level demon. The top
[01:16:53.820 --> 01:17:00.060]  generals, they're not about money. They're about killing Christians and innocents. Let's
[01:17:00.060 --> 01:17:04.980]  go to the clip of the State Department admits ISIS smuggling in terrorists. We feel good
[01:17:04.980 --> 01:17:11.060]  that it's done appropriately. It's done thoroughly that the vetting is good. The president has
[01:17:11.060 --> 01:17:15.100]  talked about the fact that we're going to up the number of total refugees to more than
[01:17:15.100 --> 01:17:21.260]  100,000 for fiscal year 17. It wouldn't debate the fact that there's the potential for ISIS
[01:17:21.260 --> 01:17:25.300]  terrorists to try to insert themselves. We've seen that in some of the refugee camps in
[01:17:25.300 --> 01:17:29.700]  Jordan and in Turkey where they try to insert themselves into the population. But again,
[01:17:29.700 --> 01:17:33.780]  the vetting process, while not perfect, is very, very strange. It can take almost up
[01:17:33.780 --> 01:17:38.660]  to two years for a single refugee to make it to the country.
[01:17:38.660 --> 01:17:46.940]  Then that State Department spokesman, Rear Admiral John Kirby. Notice they use these
[01:17:46.940 --> 01:17:54.900]  American patriot type guys that look like Mr. America to sit there and push this crap.
[01:17:54.900 --> 01:17:58.300]  That guy knows it's far worse than they're saying. The numbers are probably 50 times
[01:17:58.300 --> 01:18:02.740]  what they're saying. I mean, there's 50 to 100,000 refugees in Austin alone. They are
[01:18:02.740 --> 01:18:09.300]  crawling all over the place. North, south, east, west, drive past a park. Hundreds, women
[01:18:09.300 --> 01:18:14.220]  and burqas. Go to them all. Burqas everywhere. Burqas, burqas everywhere.
[01:18:14.220 --> 01:18:20.220]  Let's go to this other clip. State Department takes heat for Clinton's pay for place
[01:18:20.220 --> 01:18:22.700]  scheme. It just gets into all the corruption. Same thing.
[01:18:22.700 --> 01:18:29.500]  I know you've been answering a lot of questions about pay for play. Now, it turns out that
[01:18:29.500 --> 01:18:37.500]  194 donors, either to the Hillary Clinton campaign or to the Clinton Foundation, were
[01:18:37.500 --> 01:18:43.660]  awarded slots on State Department advisory boards. And it certainly is not illegal.
[01:18:43.660 --> 01:18:48.740]  That does happen. But it does, the whole pay for play thing comes into the question about
[01:18:48.740 --> 01:18:54.020]  how does these people who simply gave money to the Clintons wind up on these State Department
[01:18:54.020 --> 01:18:57.540]  advisory boards? Well, I've seen the press reporting on this. I haven't actually seen
[01:18:57.540 --> 01:19:02.340]  the actual list that you're talking about, but I'm aware of the story. So I'm afraid
[01:19:02.340 --> 01:19:08.100]  I don't have the information in there. That said, and I won't speak for the decisions
[01:19:08.100 --> 01:19:12.260]  that they made when Secretary Clinton was Secretary of State. What I can tell you is
[01:19:12.260 --> 01:19:16.380]  that these advisory boards are important. They do help us do a better job at the State
[01:19:16.380 --> 01:19:19.180]  Department. It's all a big whitewash. If you're a TV viewer, I want to back this up
[01:19:19.180 --> 01:19:22.580]  because it was just on the clip of Hillary. What's for that weird, great, white, shark
[01:19:22.580 --> 01:19:26.020]  cresting thing she does? I've talked about this before, but the more I look at her,
[01:19:26.020 --> 01:19:29.500]  it's like she's not human. She's wearing a rubber mask where she walks out on stage
[01:19:29.500 --> 01:19:40.340]  and like, hi, I'm Hillary Clinton. Yeah, it's like what, like demon leaves her or something?
[01:19:40.340 --> 01:19:44.460]  And she, I mean, you're like, it's like the Joker. If you put green paint on her, she's
[01:19:44.460 --> 01:19:51.140]  ready to start on the next Batman. I mean, she's way creepier than the guy that committed
[01:19:51.140 --> 01:19:55.700]  suicide that played the Joker. And he was pretty darn, darn creepy. We'll be back with
[01:19:55.700 --> 01:20:00.900]  your phone calls straight ahead. Your calls, George and others, Cleford, you name it, stay

[01:21:04.500 --> 01:21:09.620]  of the Andreas five-seat oil in my morning one-world-way drink and was still happy and
[01:21:09.620 --> 01:21:14.260]  energized at 3 p.m. Normally, I feel tired and spacey at the end of the day, but today
[01:21:14.260 --> 01:21:19.060]  I felt energy and very clear. My friend at the farmers market asked what I was on. She
[01:21:19.060 --> 01:21:23.700]  said my eyes look bright and I had unusual energy for that time of afternoon. I told
[01:21:23.700 --> 01:21:28.220]  her there was a magical oil that enabled my body to absorb the sun's energy as if I were
[01:21:28.220 --> 01:21:34.140]  a plant. She said, I want some. A second one-world-way shake with the oil when I got home took me
[01:21:34.140 --> 01:21:38.980]  to bed time with that wonderful abundant energy. I couldn't believe how much I got
[01:21:38.980 --> 01:21:43.860]  done and how great I felt. The combination of one-world-way and five-seat oil produced
[01:21:43.860 --> 01:21:48.140]  a significant health event in my life, the time that makes you feel you've been given
[01:21:48.140 --> 01:21:51.500]  your life back with a bonus and I'm 64.

[01:24:25.300 --> 01:24:51.100]  Coming up, a flashback to September a few months ago, or it was republished, I guess this
[01:24:51.100 --> 01:25:00.260]  happened back in July. Man attacked while predicting ISIS attack. It turned out to be basically
[01:25:00.260 --> 01:25:04.740]  a prophet. He's in New York. He says, ISIS is coming in. They're in the refugees. ISIS
[01:25:04.740 --> 01:25:08.620]  admits they're coming in with the refugees, and they're going to get massive numbers here
[01:25:08.620 --> 01:25:13.620]  and then start attacking us. Donald Trump's not bad saying, vet them, and they attack
[01:25:13.620 --> 01:25:19.740]  the poor guy. And then a few months later, exactly what he says ends up happening. And
[01:25:19.740 --> 01:25:22.780]  look, my point is, you could say the terror threat's overblown. You could say whatever
[01:25:22.780 --> 01:25:28.740]  you want. And I agree. It's overblown in that they let these people in, they attack us,
[01:25:28.740 --> 01:25:33.940]  and then we're told we have to be all spied on by the NSA. But this latest attacker's
[01:25:33.940 --> 01:25:39.540]  dad told him two years ago he was a terrorist going to the Middle East to train to attack
[01:25:39.540 --> 01:25:45.060]  and the government did nothing. And then it turns out the FBI had him on a list but didn't
[01:25:45.060 --> 01:25:51.660]  do anything again. It's a joke. You let them in here so that society becomes unstable so
[01:25:51.660 --> 01:25:56.060]  you can come in and end our free society. You bring people in who aren't compatible
[01:25:56.060 --> 01:26:01.340]  with a free society. Let me give you a better analogy. There's a great party going on. 200
[01:26:01.340 --> 01:26:07.740]  people are there. It's on the seaside. There's a big pool. There's a band playing jazz. And
[01:26:07.740 --> 01:26:13.340]  you want to ruin the party and you take a big old pitcher, a crap. You've been saving
[01:26:13.340 --> 01:26:16.980]  up at home every morning. And you go in there and you dump all those turds in the punch
[01:26:16.980 --> 01:26:22.340]  bowl. And then you sit there and say, hey, I've got to shut this party down. Because
[01:26:22.340 --> 01:26:27.500]  that would shut the party down. It'd be so gross and so disgusting, no more party. George
[01:26:27.500 --> 01:26:33.740]  Soros has crapped in the punch bowl. Well, that's George Soros and his son. They climb
[01:26:33.740 --> 01:26:39.900]  up at your party, pull their drawers down, hang their hairy butts over the punch bowl,
[01:26:39.900 --> 01:26:44.780]  and then crap all over us and tell us they're messiahs. Excuse my French, but I mean, I've
[01:26:44.780 --> 01:26:50.380]  had it with these people. So that's all coming up too.
[01:26:50.380 --> 01:26:55.060]  Let's go ahead and go back to your phone calls. This is a short segment, long segment coming
[01:26:55.060 --> 01:27:00.500]  up. This up first here. Is it Clifford or is it George? I think George is actually first
[01:27:00.500 --> 01:27:05.260]  in Clifford. George, you're on the year. Will Hillary make the debate?
[01:27:05.260 --> 01:27:09.860]  I think she's not going to make it, but I think everybody should take a look at some
[01:27:09.860 --> 01:27:15.380]  of the pictures of Hillary on the web before and after she falls over. I mean, she went
[01:27:15.380 --> 01:27:23.420]  on a great diet. She lost 20 pounds and a lot of fat around the face too. I mean, which
[01:27:23.420 --> 01:27:29.940]  Hillary are we going to have at the debate? One of the three clones she has there. And
[01:27:29.940 --> 01:27:37.140]  you know, it's ridiculous. I think Trump should go into the debate with the placards
[01:27:37.140 --> 01:27:43.260]  or little signs like Perot did with the illustrations and everything, all the lies and all the dead
[01:27:43.260 --> 01:27:49.340]  bodies and things like that. And you know, Hillary, can you explain why these people
[01:27:49.340 --> 01:27:55.540]  always drop dead just before they're supposed to testify? I mean, this is just a coincidence,
[01:27:55.540 --> 01:28:00.260]  right? I mean, so what do you have 50 people in a row? Well, I tell you, George, that's
[01:28:00.260 --> 01:28:04.500]  a whole nother question is what is Trump going to hit her with? So A, do you think she's
[01:28:04.500 --> 01:28:08.300]  going to show up? You brought up the whole body double thing. I don't know that's really
[01:28:08.300 --> 01:28:14.700]  going on. I know LBJ did it. Some other presidents did it in the 21st century with HD. Even the
[01:28:14.700 --> 01:28:20.300]  best body doubles aren't very usable in something like a debate. I mean, this would be the biggest
[01:28:20.300 --> 01:28:26.700]  Academy Award winning actress ever. If she a looked like Hillary and could pull it off.
[01:28:26.700 --> 01:28:31.500]  I mean, people are calling it a body double because she looks so bad just compared to
[01:28:31.500 --> 01:28:35.620]  a few months ago. But you know, now she's trying to morph into Donald Trump. She's styling
[01:28:35.620 --> 01:28:40.180]  her hair like his. She's standing in front of the airplane like he does. She's saying,
[01:28:40.180 --> 01:28:46.220]  you know, have strong vetting of refugees. Like he says. So who knows? But if she does
[01:28:46.220 --> 01:28:49.140]  make the debate, do you think she'll make it through 90 minutes? I mean, I don't know
[01:28:49.140 --> 01:28:54.340]  how she can make it when she can never stand up more than 15 minutes. What will what will
[01:28:54.340 --> 01:29:01.500]  the demonic chipmunk do? I don't think it's possible, but maybe we're going to have some
[01:29:01.500 --> 01:29:05.340]  help from the president since he's going to be the chairman of the UN Security Council.
[01:29:05.340 --> 01:29:10.060]  I hear. Well, he already was for a while. That was very treasonous. He did that what
[01:29:10.060 --> 01:29:15.540]  six years ago for a what eight months term or however it works. It varies six months
[01:29:15.540 --> 01:29:19.860]  to a year. I think he served eight months as the head of the UN Security Council while
[01:29:19.860 --> 01:29:24.180]  he was the president. Totally illegal. Just another way to again, do you know what the
[01:29:24.180 --> 01:29:29.180]  punch bowl and the name of this segment will be titled George Soros. Craps in America's
[01:29:29.180 --> 01:29:34.340]  punch bowl. Excuse me, folks, but I'm the allegory fit. So I must use it. I'm not normally
[01:29:34.340 --> 01:29:41.500]  a vulgar person, but only vulgarity matches that of the repose of the great demon King
[01:29:41.500 --> 01:29:47.100]  George Soros, Clifford, Scott, Carl, Anthony, your calls are straight ahead. Stay with us.
[01:29:47.100 --> 01:29:58.100]  I'm Alex Jones. We're on the March, the empires on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:30:23.260 --> 01:30:27.700]  Or will they try to do another forum like we've seen before? This is all going to be
[01:30:27.700 --> 01:30:33.860]  leading up to our 48 hour long coverage on November 8 of the election between Hillary
[01:30:33.860 --> 01:30:39.420]  Clinton and Donald Trump and the future of America. Make sure you spread this like wildfire
[01:30:39.420 --> 01:30:45.620]  because we need to get patriots all over the country aligned and ready to stand up and
[01:30:45.620 --> 01:30:51.060]  make the changes we need done by voting and getting someone in who will actually take
[01:30:51.060 --> 01:31:16.380]  America back and make America great again. This has been Joe Binks with info wars.com.

[01:32:01.500 --> 01:32:05.260]  pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of the Bright Side and as many of you know, I'm on a mission
[01:32:05.260 --> 01:32:09.820]  to help Americans get and stay healthy. You've all heard the shocking statistics despite
[01:32:09.820 --> 01:32:14.420]  spending trillions of dollars in healthcare, nearly $10,000 per man, woman and child in
[01:32:14.420 --> 01:32:19.900]  this country. Obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease and auto immune illnesses are rampant.
[01:32:19.900 --> 01:32:23.180]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge and everyone

[01:33:11.900 --> 01:33:23.580]  Live from the infowarsteam.com studios, it's Alex Jones. His speeches are so short though.
[01:33:23.580 --> 01:33:28.820]  They don't last long, you know they're like 10 minutes let's get out of here. Go back
[01:33:28.820 --> 01:33:35.700]  home and go to sleep. Three days later she gets up and she does another one and goes
[01:33:35.700 --> 01:33:42.340]  back home and goes to sleep. Please let that man be president. Oh boy his ice is hoping
[01:33:42.340 --> 01:33:50.980]  for her. Is China hoping? Can you imagine China? They come in, they have a negotiate
[01:33:50.980 --> 01:33:57.860]  with the Chinese, they're tough, they're tough. You got to hit them back with a lot of energy.
[01:33:57.860 --> 01:34:03.780]  That was a month ago. That was in the middle of August, we're now 21 days into September.
[01:34:03.780 --> 01:34:08.580]  The big debate's coming up next Monday. And he said on a bunch of tweets yesterday saying
[01:34:08.580 --> 01:34:12.460]  where is she? She's canceled these events and now she won't be seen until the debate
[01:34:12.460 --> 01:34:17.500]  next Monday. And when they have her disappear for three, four days she's able to come out,
[01:34:17.500 --> 01:34:23.340]  do a 15, 20 minute speech, start coughing as soon as she walks off the stage and stumble.
[01:34:23.340 --> 01:34:27.340]  And then when she's on her airplane doing individual press interviews, they're very short, they're
[01:34:27.340 --> 01:34:35.180]  very quick. She looks bombed out of her brain on suppressants, which is what you take when
[01:34:35.180 --> 01:34:43.620]  you have a brain tumor or epileptic episodes, brain tumor causing epileptic episodes. And
[01:34:43.620 --> 01:34:48.820]  the word we've got is brain tumor. And then it's spread to her lungs as well. And I have
[01:34:48.820 --> 01:34:59.100]  that from super high level sources whose voices shake when they tell me because it's not good
[01:34:59.100 --> 01:35:07.620]  to be one of those whistleblowers. I am a madman as everyone knows. That's why you get
[01:35:07.620 --> 01:35:11.980]  the information here. And by the way, I don't want to be the guy that gives you the information.
[01:35:11.980 --> 01:35:18.660]  Other people won't do it. I'll do it. Same thing Trump's doing. Other people won't step
[01:35:18.660 --> 01:35:25.540]  up with the plate and take on the globalist and take their neck off our throat. Trump's
[01:35:25.540 --> 01:35:29.900]  doing it. By the way, he's not perfect. You know, he says Snowden's a traitor, execute
[01:35:29.900 --> 01:35:33.420]  him and stuff because he's this old school deal where, hey, you give up our secrets,
[01:35:33.420 --> 01:35:36.300]  we're going to kill you. That's why he's going up against the globalists and Hillary's
[01:35:36.300 --> 01:35:40.700]  selling us out. It pisses him off. If you sell us out to farm powers, Trump is not very
[01:35:40.700 --> 01:35:45.780]  tech savvy. He's got advisors and they're not saying kill Snowden, but he doesn't use
[01:35:45.780 --> 01:35:51.420]  the internet folks other than Twitter. That's a no. So none of us are perfect. That's like
[01:35:51.420 --> 01:35:56.020]  when he said, we got to bring the refugees in. They're Christians are being murdered.
[01:35:56.020 --> 01:36:00.700]  They went, sir, it's 0.4%. They're not letting the Christians out. They're bringing an unvetted
[01:36:00.700 --> 01:36:06.740]  Wahhabist. He said, shut them all down. They're not vetting them. People go, oh, he flip flop.
[01:36:06.740 --> 01:36:12.580]  No, as he gets better info, he moves to it and says, I got better info. He's called a
[01:36:12.580 --> 01:36:19.540]  leader. And quite frankly, next time I talk to him either on air or off, I'll just say,
[01:36:19.540 --> 01:36:24.700]  you know, Snowden really is a hero, sir. And I think that's one area I disagree with you
[01:36:24.700 --> 01:36:27.940]  on, but you're talking to Donald Trump on the phone. You just have a tendency not to
[01:36:27.940 --> 01:36:31.700]  disagree with him, which is a problem. You know, I did challenge him the one time he
[01:36:31.700 --> 01:36:36.460]  came on. And by the way, we can get Donald Trump back on. I've left it alone because
[01:36:36.460 --> 01:36:42.420]  the thoughts are, is it good to come on or is it bad? And I can't say for a hundred percent
[01:36:42.420 --> 01:36:46.460]  sure that they couldn't twist it to hurt Trump. And I don't want to be the guy who people
[01:36:46.460 --> 01:36:50.220]  point out and say, you know, you had him on and they tied him to this and that. And you
[01:36:50.220 --> 01:36:57.660]  know, now Trump's lost. So I'm kind of like, maybe you shouldn't come on right now because
[01:36:57.660 --> 01:37:02.380]  it isn't that big a deal to get Trump on the air. That doesn't really boost our ratings
[01:37:02.380 --> 01:37:08.700]  much. What does is breaking news, breaking major analysis, having, you know, a huge effect
[01:37:08.700 --> 01:37:13.620]  in the world, being able to, you know, to talk to Trump and, and bounce ideas around
[01:37:13.620 --> 01:37:17.660]  it and see him understand it and actually, you know, research it and then do something
[01:37:17.660 --> 01:37:22.500]  about it. That's what's exciting. In fact, I would much rather have a 20 minute phone
[01:37:22.500 --> 01:37:29.300]  conversation with Donald Trump than even have him on air because it's that private type
[01:37:29.300 --> 01:37:34.260]  of conversation. I missed a phone call from him just a few weeks ago. I get so upset
[01:37:34.260 --> 01:37:37.020]  when I do. And it's just like, because I mean, I don't have a real talk with Donald
[01:37:37.020 --> 01:37:43.100]  Trump. That that's what's important because he's real folks. And it's just an amazing
[01:37:43.100 --> 01:37:47.820]  time to be alive because I don't care about Hollywood stars. I mean, I used to not care
[01:37:47.820 --> 01:37:55.420]  much. I mean, I don't care at all. I was at Hollywood parties 10 years ago. There'd be
[01:37:55.420 --> 01:38:02.340]  like 20 people there and Brad Pitt would be there. And I was just boring talking to Brad
[01:38:02.340 --> 01:38:11.060]  Pitt, boring, boring, boring. I was like, let's get out of here and go, you know, to a national
[01:38:11.060 --> 01:38:16.500]  park and hike or something. That'd be fun, right? Or let's, let's try to go surfing.
[01:38:16.500 --> 01:38:24.780]  I heard I could take surf lessons around here and I'll just leave and go surfing. I mean,
[01:38:24.780 --> 01:38:30.180]  I just, it's just that people never been there. They don't know how empty it is of the leftist
[01:38:30.180 --> 01:38:36.780]  as the actual foot soldiers to go in and destabilize things to bring in civil emergencies, martial
[01:38:36.780 --> 01:38:43.100]  law and then start arresting the political opponents of Islam, claiming Islam is attacking
[01:38:43.100 --> 01:38:49.900]  because you insulted it. And now I was sure of this about three, four years ago. I went
[01:38:49.900 --> 01:38:54.940]  from not believing it to having one of the most detailed analysis. Once I understood
[01:38:54.940 --> 01:38:59.620]  it, once I implemented the understanding with the data already had, then it brought us a
[01:38:59.620 --> 01:39:04.900]  very clear battlefront full spectrum analysis of exactly what we were facing. And it's,
[01:39:04.900 --> 01:39:09.980]  it's abominable. It is absolutely blasphemous. And you can see it. It's the fall of Russia,
[01:39:09.980 --> 01:39:14.380]  the fall of Europe, the fall of Canada, the fall of the US, the fall of Australia, the
[01:39:14.380 --> 01:39:25.660]  fall of the Mediterranean nations, the fall of basically Southeast Asia to Islam, at least
[01:39:25.660 --> 01:39:30.580]  using Islam as the frontline shock troops, the start civil wars. Of course. And I was
[01:39:30.580 --> 01:39:38.140]  kind of like, yeah, you know, cheesy. Okay. He's got a hot wife, boring, pop media. Don't
[01:39:38.140 --> 01:39:42.340]  want to know about Trump. So I started putting two and two together. I'm going to your calls
[01:39:42.340 --> 01:39:47.660]  about three years ago. I'm like, why is this famous person I'm having dinner with bringing
[01:39:47.660 --> 01:39:51.980]  up Donald Trump? Like, oh, here's another glass of wine. What do you think about Donald
[01:39:51.980 --> 01:39:57.100]  Trump? You're sitting there going, the casino owner? I don't know. Got with orange hair?
[01:39:57.100 --> 01:40:00.900]  I don't know anything about it. And you're fired. Because you know, I know about politics
[01:40:00.900 --> 01:40:05.220]  and stuff. I'm kind of blind to a lot of pop stuff. I'm like, well, Donald Trump's a patriot
[01:40:05.220 --> 01:40:08.980]  and he's going to be, you know, trying to take America back and stuff. And you know,
[01:40:08.980 --> 01:40:14.500]  kind of that's what you're doing. You're like, oh, can we move on to the discussion by the
[01:40:14.500 --> 01:40:21.420]  third or fourth time that happened? I'm like, what's going on here? And then it all started
[01:40:21.420 --> 01:40:26.540]  to click Trump the whole time. And now this I've confirmed this has known what's going
[01:40:26.540 --> 01:40:33.100]  on before I was born. He knew his dad knew they've been anti new world order like John
[01:40:33.100 --> 01:40:37.860]  Burt's people for 50 something years. I don't mean like in the John Burt society, but basically
[01:40:37.860 --> 01:40:46.060]  that informed. And that's why the globalists have dossiers on the Trumps. They are in terrified
[01:40:46.060 --> 01:40:51.980]  fits and the emails from the State Department, the Winehouse, Bohemian Grove, Bilderberg,
[01:40:51.980 --> 01:40:58.940]  all of it. They are in a you submit to it. You are cuckled. You are broken. You are fallen.
[01:40:58.940 --> 01:41:06.340]  Submit. And so that's the battle plan. That's the program. That's that's that's the piece
[01:41:06.340 --> 01:41:13.420]  of art. The globalists are producing. That's who they are. And there's no doubt about it.
[01:41:13.420 --> 01:41:16.780]  You know, Savage, I wanted interrupting because, you know, he was on target with official numbers
[01:41:16.780 --> 01:41:22.260]  about 600,000 Muslims under Obama and the rest of it. Remember, we first broke two and
[01:41:22.260 --> 01:41:27.460]  a half years ago that they were bringing people in from Latin America with no IDs. Most of
[01:41:27.460 --> 01:41:31.140]  them weren't children. They were just being brought in with diseases, you name it. And
[01:41:31.140 --> 01:41:34.540]  the board patrol was ordered just to stand down and keep it secret. It's the same thing
[01:41:34.540 --> 01:41:39.420]  with the Muslims. It's just kept secret. We don't know. But the numbers must be extremely
[01:41:39.420 --> 01:41:43.140]  high for what I'm seeing around the country. Just like Europe, the first few years, they
[01:41:43.140 --> 01:41:51.220]  claimed it was 100,000. It was millions. So this is really serious. What's happened? And
[01:41:51.220 --> 01:41:55.940]  you have to understand the average Muslim is a victim of the cult they're in. The Wahhabi
[01:41:55.940 --> 01:42:01.780]  is cult they're in. The average Muslim is a sad person. I would rather be free. I didn't
[01:42:01.780 --> 01:42:05.340]  want to bomb them. I was against those wars. I wasn't for the class of civilizations. I
[01:42:05.340 --> 01:42:10.540]  tried to stop this. Here's the deal. We didn't stop it. And it was worse than I thought.
[01:42:10.540 --> 01:42:15.940]  I mean, look, I've got blind spots. We have a lot of sources. We have a lot of data. We
[01:42:15.940 --> 01:42:20.660]  have a lot of the emails and hacks. But when I talked about Hillary's crimes and first
[01:42:20.660 --> 01:42:24.660]  broke it four years ago with Tosh Plumley and others here, CIA whistleblowers about
[01:42:24.660 --> 01:42:30.060]  her and the foundation and her on the State Department and the weapons and the and the
[01:42:30.060 --> 01:42:38.340]  list of Apple of hundreds of thousands of apps in two days, two days. We are number 30.
[01:42:38.340 --> 01:42:46.900]  I mean, Xbox, the free app with hundreds of free games, you name it, is 27 hundreds of
[01:42:46.900 --> 01:42:52.940]  billions of dollars pumped into Xbox, hundreds of millions, no doubt, into their apps. And
[01:42:52.940 --> 01:43:04.220]  we are already in 48 hours on their tail. What do you think of that? Google play movies
[01:43:04.220 --> 01:43:11.820]  and TV is 31. Info war is live. Just to give you a little snapshot of who you are. We are
[01:43:11.820 --> 01:43:15.740]  the future. We are the majority. When I tell you we have 30 million listeners a week, folks,
[01:43:15.740 --> 01:43:22.740]  that's what we can aggregate with our sensors. We experts believe that YouTube was vice president
[01:43:22.740 --> 01:43:29.460]  told me two years ago, we can track five billion views of your videos that have your name in
[01:43:29.460 --> 01:43:39.100]  it. You are the biggest thing on YouTube, not political, the biggest thing. Let us kick
[01:43:39.100 --> 01:43:44.700]  everyone off that has your content and monetize it. And you could be getting a million dollars
[01:43:44.700 --> 01:43:49.220]  a month instead of 30 40,000. And I said, I'm not doing that. I want the information
[01:43:49.220 --> 01:43:54.340]  to get out. Maybe I should monetize and then I can fund everything. But see the problem
[01:43:54.340 --> 01:43:58.620]  is I'd rather have that was two years ago. Lord knows what it is now. They can see that.
[01:43:58.620 --> 01:44:04.580]  I can't. Lord knows what that is now because everybody's allowed to run our stuff and put
[01:44:04.580 --> 01:44:13.020]  ads on it because I don't care about the money. I care about the views. I care about changing
[01:44:13.020 --> 01:44:24.300]  people's minds. Five billion views on other people's channels two years ago, close to
[01:44:24.300 --> 01:44:29.580]  a billion and a half conservatively on our own channels, right at a billion now on the
[01:44:29.580 --> 01:44:33.660]  Alex Jones channel. So when I say five billion views, that's two years old folks. I don't
[01:44:33.660 --> 01:44:39.180]  know what it is now. Cause I didn't play ball. Google stopped talking to me. They were like,
[01:44:39.180 --> 01:44:42.900]  fly out to San Francisco. We'll fly out. Let's just get it on right now. Google's ready.
[01:44:42.900 --> 01:44:46.980]  Let's do it. I said, well, I don't want to kick all these tens of thousands, hundreds
[01:44:46.980 --> 01:44:50.180]  of thousands of videos off. I don't want to have that content lost. Yeah, but you understand
[01:44:50.180 --> 01:44:53.700]  they're monetizing your content. And so a lot of them are, you know, we want to make
[01:44:53.700 --> 01:44:58.220]  a special partnership with you where we're going to promote you, blah, blah. But it was
[01:44:58.220 --> 01:45:01.580]  just like Facebook to like Facebook would like you to fly to New York and like to meet
[01:45:01.580 --> 01:45:05.140]  with you. But can you kind of knock it off a little bit? We can really help you. You
[01:45:05.140 --> 01:45:09.140]  know, you won't just have a couple million people on Facebook. How about a hundred million
[01:45:09.140 --> 01:45:15.260]  Alex? I'm like, I've heard this before. No, how about, how about, no, how about never?
[01:45:15.260 --> 01:45:23.140]  Okay. I'm just not, I'm not, why would I sell out to the new world order? I mean, I'm not
[01:45:23.140 --> 01:45:27.820]  signing onto your spirit. You understand? I cannot get in bed with you because you're,
[01:45:27.820 --> 01:45:32.220]  you're really disgusting to me. Okay. I'd rather die than get in bed with you. You understand?
[01:45:32.220 --> 01:45:39.620]  I can't, I can't get excited around you. I mean, you know, if you want to use that metaphysical
[01:45:39.620 --> 01:45:44.060]  example, your kids are listening to you and telling them to turn away right now, I can't
[01:45:44.060 --> 01:45:51.460]  get it up for the new world order. You understand that? See, I'm not with you. I'll never be
[01:45:51.460 --> 01:45:55.220]  with you. And I'm just an average person. I'm a nobody. Look at how one guy from Texas
[01:45:55.220 --> 01:45:58.420]  is like tearing the living hell out of you. Look at Donald Trump tearing you up. That's
[01:45:58.420 --> 01:46:01.140]  just people that are willing to stand up to you. Don't care if you kill us. What are you
[01:46:01.140 --> 01:46:04.580]  going to do when more people stand up? Don't you get we're only the prototype? We're only
[01:46:04.580 --> 01:46:09.220]  the early version. It gets worse from here on out as the machines take on humanity,
[01:46:09.220 --> 01:46:14.100]  as you try to dehumanize us, as you shut us down. It gets worse for you. You're on the
[01:46:14.100 --> 01:46:22.180]  losing side. You're like a training droid for us. That's all you are in God's plan,
[01:46:22.180 --> 01:46:26.380]  but you are so delusional because your little God has given you power that you think we're
[01:46:26.380 --> 01:46:39.900]  going to fail. 48 hours and we are defeating Google's free video app. We are three spaces
[01:46:39.900 --> 01:46:46.540]  or two spaces behind Xbox with their app out for years. What does that tell you? It tells
[01:46:46.540 --> 01:46:51.500]  you massive numbers, hundreds and hundreds of thousands of not millions of already downloaded
[01:46:51.500 --> 01:46:57.500]  free app. Just an example of you. You have the power. You're the majority and they do
[01:46:57.500 --> 01:47:02.820]  everything they can that you never figure that out. Where do you get the app? Infowars.com
[01:47:02.820 --> 01:47:08.460]  forward slash app. Infowars.com forward slash show as a link or go to the droid or Apple
[01:47:08.460 --> 01:47:15.220]  stores. It's free. Go to the free section and type in info wars live. Free video feeds,
[01:47:15.220 --> 01:47:19.380]  audio feeds. We're about to add alerts, live events. I'm going to do special every day
[01:47:19.380 --> 01:47:22.740]  separately. I'm going to do whole shows every day, quite frankly. I'm going to start waking
[01:47:22.740 --> 01:47:26.500]  up at 3 a.m. and doing shows, sort of walking around my house the middle of the night, worried
[01:47:26.500 --> 01:47:31.900]  about stuff. I'm just going to literally turn it on in front of the couch by myself. We're
[01:47:31.900 --> 01:47:39.180]  going in, through and beyond. All right, let's go to your calls. I've done okay. I've taken
[01:47:39.180 --> 01:47:42.940]  seven or eight calls. I want to take more now. Let's go to Clifford in Delaware. Clifford,
[01:47:42.940 --> 01:47:47.300]  you're on the air. Go ahead. Thanks for holding. Hey Alex, you can tutor our horn any kind
[01:47:47.300 --> 01:47:51.900]  of brothers doing a one on one. It's our horn, brother. The Liberty movement's big and popular
[01:47:51.900 --> 01:47:59.980]  and sexy. And I'm proud of you on a winning team. So I wanted to tell you, boss, that
[01:47:59.980 --> 01:48:04.300]  I believe that Hillary Clinton will make the debate. It's not going to be the whole debate.
[01:48:04.300 --> 01:48:09.460]  She'll probably make it about 45 minutes and then our government will have already a crisis
[01:48:09.460 --> 01:48:13.940]  already on standby. It'll break loose and then that'll be the end of the debate because
[01:48:13.940 --> 01:48:17.860]  they'll have to go to an emergency broadcast and there will be no more debate for that
[01:48:17.860 --> 01:48:23.020]  evening. And that way it saves Hillary a fallout. Well, that's what I'm thinking. I think that
[01:48:23.020 --> 01:48:26.540]  because they control ISIS, Hillary literally founded it. They could have an ISIS attack
[01:48:26.540 --> 01:48:30.140]  right before to try to cancel it. I mean, they could do anything. I agree with you. What
[01:48:30.140 --> 01:48:35.980]  else do you think? What else do I think? If I want to ask you that, you know how the
[01:48:35.980 --> 01:48:40.540]  economy is propped up right now by the government, everything's propped up, just waiting for
[01:48:40.540 --> 01:48:44.940]  the, you know, for the right, you know, cue to go off. But my question is, how can we
[01:48:44.940 --> 01:48:50.180]  continue to allow migrants to come into the country if we wind up collapsing as a nation,
[01:48:50.180 --> 01:48:55.220]  like the economy collapses and then they issue more for law? We're going to be so, they're
[01:48:55.220 --> 01:48:59.020]  going to be so tied up with getting us all rounded up and under control that how are
[01:48:59.020 --> 01:49:01.860]  they going to be able to control the migrants come across the border, give them the bus
[01:49:01.860 --> 01:49:02.860]  way?
[01:49:02.860 --> 01:49:05.420]  Well, that's all part of the hysteria and the migrants already come from collapsed
[01:49:05.420 --> 01:49:09.820]  economies. So they'll just kind of hang out, you know, and in migrant camps and in portangs
[01:49:09.820 --> 01:49:14.580]  and be used as a permanent underclass to drop down wages. But look, the globalists don't
[01:49:14.580 --> 01:49:19.140]  care. Soros will just manage whatever crisis happens, have his companies be appointed by
[01:49:19.140 --> 01:49:24.740]  the government as the managers and then wander his own money back through his own organizations,
[01:49:24.740 --> 01:49:27.260]  exacerbating the crisis. That's what he does.
[01:49:27.260 --> 01:49:33.700]  You should do Alex have a reward, have people start donating to info wars for a reward
[01:49:33.700 --> 01:49:40.140]  to get, you know, for the, for the apprehension, you know, of, of George Soros, you know, that
[01:49:40.140 --> 01:49:43.940]  sounds like a great idea. There's the problem is he is wanted to some countries that gets
[01:49:43.940 --> 01:49:47.820]  into bounty hunting, very serious laws. If you don't do that right, it's a felony. So
[01:49:47.820 --> 01:49:52.540]  that's the reason we can't do that. Soros is mainly like a rotting figurehead of a larger
[01:49:52.540 --> 01:49:58.700]  evil iceberg under the water. But what we do need is people to support us. God bless
[01:49:58.700 --> 01:50:01.660]  you. I appreciate your call, Clifford. We're going to go to break and come right back with
[01:50:01.660 --> 01:50:06.500]  a Carl, a Scott, then Carl, then Anthony, Shane and others. Now, speaking of money,
[01:50:06.500 --> 01:50:11.260]  we don't make money spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on a really cutting edge app and
[01:50:11.260 --> 01:50:15.460]  then giving it out for free, but we do selling SuperMailVitality in X2. I'm just extending
[01:50:15.460 --> 01:50:18.860]  it because people really asked us to extend it till they got their paychecks. We have
[01:50:18.860 --> 01:50:22.620]  literally, Buckley was showing me hundreds of emails came in saying, I'm getting paid
[01:50:22.620 --> 01:50:27.220]  Thursday or Friday. Please wait. I want 20% off on SuperMailVitality. So you got it.
[01:50:27.220 --> 01:50:30.460]  I'm going to extend it right through to next week. And we've got the mythical bottom and
[01:50:30.460 --> 01:50:37.820]  vitamin B12. It's 80% mythical bottom and 20% Acena-filled. I forget how you pronounce
[01:50:37.820 --> 01:50:41.860]  it. Point is that activates the other 80%. It's the best formula out there for the researchers.
[01:50:41.860 --> 01:50:47.140]  You take it under your tongue. It works amazingly. InfowarsLive.com. That's 20% off as well. Whether
[01:50:47.140 --> 01:50:51.540]  it's water filtration, books, videos, failure for prison shirts, that's how we move this
[01:50:51.540 --> 01:50:56.020]  war machine forward against the globalists. Our weapon is truth. So thanks for the support.

[01:52:00.780 --> 01:52:05.540]  Honey, I'm really worried about a retirement fund. Oh, me too. We lost so much value in
[01:52:05.540 --> 01:52:09.460]  the recession in the stock market. I'm worried we won't have enough to retire. Jim next door
[01:52:09.460 --> 01:52:13.780]  told me that he had set up a new kind of IRA with a gold silver group. He said how simple
[01:52:13.780 --> 01:52:18.660]  and safe it was. It's a private storage IRA and we could have real gold and silver in
[01:52:18.660 --> 01:52:23.420]  our hands. Really? You mean we can actually see it and touch it? Absolutely. Jim said
[01:52:23.420 --> 01:52:27.540]  we could have all the benefits of an IRA to help build our retirement income. Bottom line,
[01:52:27.540 --> 01:52:32.020]  we would own a real tangible asset and we would have the security of knowing we're protected.
[01:52:32.020 --> 01:52:35.300]  No matter what the economy does. What do you think? I think we need to find out how to
[01:52:35.300 --> 01:52:39.460]  get our own private storage IRA. We need to call the gold silver group right now. Are

[01:54:04.700 --> 01:54:09.140]  Look, one reason I don't like callers calling and telling me how great I am is that it's
[01:54:09.140 --> 01:54:13.020]  the fact that there's patriots all over this country and world that are awake is how we're
[01:54:13.020 --> 01:54:18.100]  even able to have a show like this. There's a market for the truth and that builds economies
[01:54:18.100 --> 01:54:22.020]  of truth and builds systems based on truth and that competes with the New World Order
[01:54:22.020 --> 01:54:27.860]  monopoly system that's going to replace humans in their own admission. And so don't thank
[01:54:27.860 --> 01:54:32.420]  me. I want to thank you. We're all in this symbiotically together. I mean, look at this.
[01:54:32.420 --> 01:54:36.740]  Microsoft will solve cancer within 10 years by reprogramming disease cells. Do you really
[01:54:36.740 --> 01:54:41.500]  believe that the eugenicist that wants to reduce world population and says we should
[01:54:41.500 --> 01:54:46.260]  not take care of old people really wants to do that? I mean, he's a horrible person.
[01:54:46.260 --> 01:54:56.480]  But that is a question. Will the desires and dreams of good humans be able to defeat the
[01:54:56.480 --> 01:55:02.300]  desires of the evil folks that are in control? Exclusive, Dr. Planning World's first head
[01:55:02.300 --> 01:55:08.580]  transplant say he is prepared for his Frankenstein surgery by reanimating human corpses. That's
[01:55:08.580 --> 01:55:14.820]  the type of stuff that's going on. High fat cheese, the secret to healthy life. All these
[01:55:14.820 --> 01:55:19.780]  studies, it turns out they knew for 50 years that natural high fats are essential to be
[01:55:19.780 --> 01:55:23.740]  healthy, live longer, and to make up your brain and tissues. They told you, though, don't
[01:55:23.740 --> 01:55:29.460]  have them and just have a bunch of sugar. You don't want his trans fats. That's always
[01:55:29.460 --> 01:55:41.340]  been known. But see, a lot of complex, high quality fat makes your brain work really well.
[01:55:41.340 --> 01:55:45.500]  They don't want you there. They want you in a brain fog. I mean, look, if I need energy,
[01:55:45.500 --> 01:55:50.180]  that cheese looks delicious. I put the name of that yellow one there in the middle. That
[01:55:50.180 --> 01:55:54.500]  is a really tasty one. A little Swiss cheese, whatever that is. Oh my gosh. Talk about brain
[01:55:54.500 --> 01:55:58.860]  food. I mean, I get hired to cut off a big old piece of cheese because that's what it
[01:55:58.860 --> 01:56:02.860]  is. Food is our energy. It's what we're meant to operate off of. Okay, I know I'm saying
[01:56:02.860 --> 01:56:05.860]  a lot of stuff that's common sense out there, but remember, the general public doesn't know
[01:56:05.860 --> 01:56:10.700]  that. That's why we're here to restore common sense. Like, hey, did you know the Trumps
[01:56:10.700 --> 01:56:16.540]  are out hunting triceratops? That's terrible. I want them to be arrested. Hey, lady, triceratops
[01:56:16.540 --> 01:56:24.100]  haven't lived in 20-something million years. That shows how dumb down these people are.
[01:56:24.100 --> 01:56:28.060]  We're here not grandstanding that we're smarter than them or informed. We're the folks that
[01:56:28.060 --> 01:56:31.840]  somehow got through the net and were able to be informed. We had parents that cared
[01:56:31.840 --> 01:56:35.700]  about us or whatever the case was. We've got to reach out to these victims and say, listen,
[01:56:35.700 --> 01:56:41.500]  you're not an intellectual liberal. You're a drooling moron. The next hour's gonna be
[01:56:41.500 --> 01:56:44.980]  totally jam-packed, and I'm not just saying that. I've got like two hours of stuff I haven't
[01:56:44.980 --> 01:56:50.300]  gotten to yet. Get ready. But right now, let's continue with your calls. Scott in Pennsylvania,
[01:56:50.300 --> 01:56:54.620]  you're on the air. The debates. Will Hillary show up? How can she?
[01:56:54.620 --> 01:56:56.620]  Hey, Alex. Hi.
[01:56:56.620 --> 01:56:59.500]  You're a 12-year listener, first-time caller. Thank you, sir.
[01:56:59.500 --> 01:57:05.580]  Two quick things, Alex. First of all, I've listened to you over the years, and I've never
[01:57:05.580 --> 01:57:10.180]  felt the way I've been feeling the last few weeks. Nightmares, anxieties, my guts turning.
[01:57:10.180 --> 01:57:14.820]  I truly believe in my heart. I'm not gonna get to the debate, Alex. I think something's
[01:57:14.820 --> 01:57:19.940]  gonna happen in the next five to six days. It's gonna cancel the debates. Just my feeling
[01:57:19.940 --> 01:57:20.940]  in my gut.
[01:57:20.940 --> 01:57:24.540]  I mean, I agree with you that I've never had trouble sleeping. I don't even call it nightmares.
[01:57:24.540 --> 01:57:29.500]  I just have the wildest, craziest political dreams every night, and I'm just like constantly
[01:57:29.500 --> 01:57:34.940]  waking up. I mean, I'm going to bed like nine at night now because I wake up so much, and
[01:57:34.940 --> 01:57:38.100]  then I get up early and early. I just go to bed like midnight.
[01:57:38.100 --> 01:57:43.460]  And the second thing, Alex, I have a family friend who works for Homeland Security. He's
[01:57:43.460 --> 01:57:48.420]  being sequestered from October 1st till the end of the year in a undisclosed location.
[01:57:48.420 --> 01:57:52.620]  He's not allowed to come home for the holidays, not allowed to contact his wife or family.
[01:57:52.620 --> 01:57:55.820]  I think something really major is coming down.
[01:57:55.820 --> 01:57:57.900]  Has he ever done something like this before?
[01:57:57.900 --> 01:58:00.060]  No, he has not. No, he's never been.
[01:58:00.060 --> 01:58:05.060]  Well, I mean, we know they have the UN and EU overseeing our election this year.
[01:58:05.060 --> 01:58:10.060]  Yeah, it's just really, really scary, Alex, you know, and the area I'm living here in
[01:58:10.060 --> 01:58:15.580]  Pennsylvania has always been blue. I live near Allentown, Bethlehem area, and I do a
[01:58:15.580 --> 01:58:21.340]  lot of driving around for my job, and I have not seen no lie. I have not seen one Hillary
[01:58:21.340 --> 01:58:23.900]  sign except for a couple of Hillary for prison signs.
[01:58:23.900 --> 01:58:28.060]  Same here. I see hardly any of them in a Democrat city like Austin. That's what I mean. She
[01:58:28.060 --> 01:58:32.860]  has no crowds. It's all a hoax. It's all a giant hoax, and they're crazy enough to
[01:58:32.860 --> 01:58:37.980]  sell this hoax. And we've got 47 days out from the election. This is the most incredible
[01:58:37.980 --> 01:58:41.740]  time to ever be alive, folks, and you're living it. You're living it.
[01:58:41.740 --> 01:58:42.740]  Thank you for listening.
[01:58:42.740 --> 01:58:46.060]  We'll be back with the third and fourth hour. Thank you, Scott. Amazing caller.
[01:58:46.060 --> 01:58:47.060]  Come today.
[01:58:47.060 --> 01:59:12.060]  Great points. Carl, you're up next. Get ready.
[01:59:12.060 --> 01:59:19.060]  We'll be back with the third and fourth hour.
[01:59:42.060 --> 01:59:49.060]  Right now at infowarslife.com, or call 888-253-3139, infowarslife, secret 12.
[02:00:12.060 --> 02:00:32.060]  Well, Obama came out yesterday with the U.N. and said that we should give up our sovereignty
[02:00:32.060 --> 02:00:37.060]  to the U.N. He actually said that. That's their problem. When they actually try to establish
[02:00:37.060 --> 02:00:42.060]  control government, they can't deny it exists anymore. They can't deny it's unelected.
[02:00:42.060 --> 02:00:47.740]  So now they're calling it the liberal world order to fight racism. That means use the
[02:00:47.740 --> 02:00:52.980]  third world as a weapon to bring down what's left of Western countries or wealthy countries
[02:00:52.980 --> 02:00:58.140]  to make everybody poor, and then the globalists have finished their takeover. While they race
[02:00:58.140 --> 02:01:03.420]  to replace us with robots, that's all being announced. So it's quite a pickle we're in,
[02:01:03.420 --> 02:01:10.420]  but we still see a lot of opportunities to turn this around.
[02:01:10.420 --> 02:01:14.420]  Will Hillary make the debate next Monday? It's set to have more viewers on the Super Bowl.
[02:01:14.420 --> 02:01:19.220]  They're talking about 100 million in the Hill newspaper, talking to insiders and experts
[02:01:19.220 --> 02:01:22.660]  that are already gauging interest. I agree with that. I said bigger than the Super Bowl
[02:01:22.660 --> 02:01:30.820]  or as big two weeks ago. Or will they stage something to get her out of it? Or will she
[02:01:30.820 --> 02:01:37.820]  collapse during it? Let's talk to Carl in Florida. What do you think, Carl?
[02:01:37.820 --> 02:01:39.820]  Hello, Mr. Jones.
[02:01:39.820 --> 02:01:41.820]  Hey, brother, go ahead.
[02:01:41.820 --> 02:01:46.820]  Hey, real quick. What I'm thinking is they know how high the stakes are. I'm fairly certain
[02:01:46.820 --> 02:01:50.820]  that they're going to wedge her by just past this, you know, this whole debate business.
[02:01:50.820 --> 02:01:57.820]  I expected to show up with her, you know, anti-seizure contact lenses on, you know, completely.
[02:01:57.820 --> 02:02:02.820]  You know, she's going to probably be pumped up with some sort of slow acting epinephrine.
[02:02:02.820 --> 02:02:06.820]  And they would probably, if the stakes weren't too high, at least in terms of ratings, I
[02:02:06.820 --> 02:02:11.820]  would have expected her to probably be down the immediate, the immediate days afterwards.
[02:02:11.820 --> 02:02:16.820]  But they're going to probably throw her out and she'll be on the TV for maybe a day or
[02:02:16.820 --> 02:02:19.820]  so afterwards. And then the next three days she'll probably disappear off the face of
[02:02:19.820 --> 02:02:21.820]  the earth like she usually does.
[02:02:21.820 --> 02:02:24.820]  Sure, sure. I mean, that's why they have had to cancel her events is to get her all drugged
[02:02:24.820 --> 02:02:28.820]  up, ready, resting and then try to get her back up and hope she doesn't fall apart.
[02:02:28.820 --> 02:02:33.820]  But just then she's not preparing, then she's not getting ready, then she's nervous about
[02:02:33.820 --> 02:02:37.820]  what are the seizures come back and then that's going to make her basically choke up on screen.
[02:02:37.820 --> 02:02:41.820]  I think there's a good chance she's going to basically have to pull out of the debate
[02:02:41.820 --> 02:02:45.820]  or basically start stumbling around during it.
[02:02:45.820 --> 02:02:50.820]  Here's a question. What happens if she has a convulsion during the debate?
[02:02:50.820 --> 02:02:54.820]  Well, I think that they're going to, they're going to pull the little, you know, smoking
[02:02:54.820 --> 02:02:57.820]  mirrors tricks again and try to downplay it and say, Oh, you know what? She was just,
[02:02:57.820 --> 02:03:02.820]  you know, she tripped over a shoe or that's common to get nervous during these debates
[02:03:02.820 --> 02:03:06.820]  or some sort of stupid narrative like that. And everybody at this point, everybody that's
[02:03:06.820 --> 02:03:10.820]  paying attention is just widely, you know, wise enough to kind of see through it.
[02:03:10.820 --> 02:03:12.820]  So I'm thankful to see a lot of progress.
[02:03:12.820 --> 02:03:15.820]  Sure. Let me ask you this is we're going to come back and play the short report and go
[02:03:15.820 --> 02:03:19.820]  right back to Anthony and others that are patiently holding like Shane and John and Rick.
[02:03:19.820 --> 02:03:23.820]  Tolfering number to join us is 800-25-99231 on this subject.
[02:03:23.820 --> 02:03:26.820]  But now the phones are open on any other subjects as well.
[02:03:26.820 --> 02:03:31.820]  What about a false flag? What type of October surprise do you think Obama and Hillary
[02:03:31.820 --> 02:03:33.820]  and George Soros might pull?
[02:03:33.820 --> 02:03:36.820]  Well, you have these, these New York things.
[02:03:36.820 --> 02:03:38.820]  You got this Charlotte thing that's going on today.
[02:03:38.820 --> 02:03:42.820]  I think that they're going to, you know, there's probably going to be another two or three stories
[02:03:42.820 --> 02:03:44.820]  about all kinds of unrest and in the press.
[02:03:44.820 --> 02:03:47.820]  Oh yeah, we've always said that, that have a big race riot right before the election was
[02:03:47.820 --> 02:03:49.820]  one of the main things they could do.
[02:03:49.820 --> 02:03:54.820]  And it's pretty much starting up right now with the media hyping all these unfortunate events up.
[02:03:54.820 --> 02:03:57.820]  My gut tells me that's probably the most likely scenario.
[02:03:57.820 --> 02:04:00.820]  They're going to try to weasel their way out of this debate.
[02:04:00.820 --> 02:04:02.820]  Well, they can also have a terror attack.
[02:04:02.820 --> 02:04:03.820]  It's in New York.
[02:04:03.820 --> 02:04:04.820]  They know they brought the sleeper cells in.
[02:04:04.820 --> 02:04:05.820]  That could try to do it.
[02:04:05.820 --> 02:04:06.820]  Who knows, Carl?
[02:04:06.820 --> 02:04:09.820]  Hey, here's one thing we're going to find out.
[02:04:09.820 --> 02:04:10.820]  Oh yeah.
[02:04:10.820 --> 02:04:13.820]  What do you think about folks that say, you know, in the headlines,
[02:04:13.820 --> 02:04:16.820]  Westerners are the most bored they've ever been.
[02:04:16.820 --> 02:04:18.820]  How could you be bored right now?
[02:04:18.820 --> 02:04:20.820]  This is an incredible time.
[02:04:20.820 --> 02:04:22.820]  Oh my goodness.
[02:04:22.820 --> 02:04:25.820]  You know, just people, like I said, the sports aren't doing it.
[02:04:25.820 --> 02:04:29.820]  They, you know, the dead culture is not doing it.
[02:04:29.820 --> 02:04:33.820]  People are finally starting to come around and pay attention to things that are impacting their lives.
[02:04:33.820 --> 02:04:34.820]  And they don't like it.
[02:04:34.820 --> 02:04:36.820]  And like I said, the stakes are high.
[02:04:36.820 --> 02:04:38.820]  They're going to try to fake it through this.
[02:04:38.820 --> 02:04:40.820]  You know, they're going to try to make it through this debate.
[02:04:40.820 --> 02:04:43.820]  If not, they're going to, you know, wave something else in front of everybody's faces.
[02:04:43.820 --> 02:04:48.820]  But yeah, I think that's a load of, you know, garbage that they're saying that everybody's bored over here.
[02:04:48.820 --> 02:04:50.820]  No, people are finally starting to pay attention.
[02:04:50.820 --> 02:04:51.820]  I agree.
[02:04:51.820 --> 02:04:56.820]  There's a huge awakening taking place in info wars and Trump and everything is just a manifestation of that.
[02:04:56.820 --> 02:04:57.820]  Thank you, Carl.
[02:04:57.820 --> 02:05:24.820]  Stay with us.
[02:05:27.820 --> 02:05:34.820]  And thanks to you.
[02:05:34.820 --> 02:05:40.820]  This news comes as the Clinton Foundation is planning to drop dozens of employees like flies from its payroll,
[02:05:40.820 --> 02:05:43.820]  saying that they're closing many of its operations.
[02:05:43.820 --> 02:05:48.820]  Politico reports that two former Clinton Foundation officials will remain on their communication staff.
[02:05:48.820 --> 02:05:53.820]  The Clintons are shutting down their controversial cartel and severing many of its personal ties,
[02:05:53.820 --> 02:05:56.820]  still using primary donors like Soros to continue funding Clinton.
[02:05:56.820 --> 02:05:59.820]  I'm Margaret Howell reporting for info wars.com.
[02:06:26.820 --> 02:06:35.820]  And you're able to promote the products to friends and family and neighbors in your community and make money while helping people at the same time.
[02:06:35.820 --> 02:06:36.820]  Another win-win.
[02:06:36.820 --> 02:06:41.820]  That's why I'm a member of the young Jebedy team at info wars team.com and you can be too.
[02:06:41.820 --> 02:06:42.820]  It's simple.

[02:06:56.820 --> 02:06:59.820]  Check it out for yourself today.
[02:06:59.820 --> 02:07:01.820]  Not a group you develop living defense for us.
[02:07:01.820 --> 02:07:02.820]  It took you over a year to do it.
[02:07:02.820 --> 02:07:04.820]  Why is this so good?
[02:07:04.820 --> 02:07:09.820]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[02:07:09.820 --> 02:07:14.820]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system.
[02:07:14.820 --> 02:07:26.820]  But right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees spreading disease around.
[02:07:26.820 --> 02:07:29.820]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[02:07:29.820 --> 02:07:30.820]  These are all parasites.
[02:07:30.820 --> 02:07:31.820]  Tell us about all this episode.
[02:07:31.820 --> 02:07:33.820]  There's so many things that are in it.
[02:07:33.820 --> 02:07:34.820]  You have the neem in there.
[02:07:34.820 --> 02:07:37.820]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[02:07:37.820 --> 02:07:40.820]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[02:07:40.820 --> 02:07:44.820]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[02:07:44.820 --> 02:07:45.820]  It just came back in yesterday.
[02:07:45.820 --> 02:07:47.820]  Living Defense, infowarslife.com.
[02:07:47.820 --> 02:07:50.820]  And folks, you can't lose full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[02:07:50.820 --> 02:07:53.820]  And you support the broadcast, infowarslife.com.
[02:07:53.820 --> 02:07:56.820]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[02:07:56.820 --> 02:08:11.820]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[02:08:11.820 --> 02:08:22.820]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:22.820 --> 02:08:27.820]  We are going back to your phone calls here in a few minutes.
[02:08:27.820 --> 02:08:31.820]  The toll-free number to join us on this live Wednesday global edition is 800-25-99231.
[02:08:31.820 --> 02:08:39.820]  Coming up on Monday, we're going to be live for four hours at least from 7th Central to
[02:08:39.820 --> 02:08:45.820]  the first hour before the live debate for 90 minutes starts at 8 o'clock Central to 930
[02:08:45.820 --> 02:08:51.820]  Central between Hillary, Rodham Clinton, and Donald J. Trump in New York at a major university.
[02:08:51.820 --> 02:08:54.820]  And this debate is being put out by the university.
[02:08:54.820 --> 02:09:01.820]  It's being hosted by an NBC reporter who, despite the fact he's attacked me many times,
[02:09:01.820 --> 02:09:02.820]  I still like the guy.
[02:09:02.820 --> 02:09:03.820]  I still like watching the reporter.
[02:09:03.820 --> 02:09:09.820]  He kind of just liked the guy and how he reports, even though he doesn't like me.
[02:09:09.820 --> 02:09:10.820]  So that's coming up.
[02:09:10.820 --> 02:09:12.820]  It's not an NBC debate.
[02:09:12.820 --> 02:09:15.820]  It is being hosted by one of their moderators.
[02:09:15.820 --> 02:09:18.820]  So it's basically open everywhere.
[02:09:18.820 --> 02:09:22.820]  Anybody can go out and subscribe to one of the cameras and services that is there.
[02:09:22.820 --> 02:09:23.820]  We're doing that.
[02:09:23.820 --> 02:09:25.820]  We're going to have reporters there as well.
[02:09:25.820 --> 02:09:31.820]  So it won't be like where I'm playing the last MSNBC debate and then talking over 90%
[02:09:31.820 --> 02:09:34.820]  of it because we have to do that to give analysis and commentary.
[02:09:34.820 --> 02:09:36.820]  That's how we're able to take it and carry it.
[02:09:36.820 --> 02:09:38.820]  I started doing that last election now.
[02:09:38.820 --> 02:09:39.820]  Lenbeck does it.
[02:09:39.820 --> 02:09:40.820]  The Young Turks do it.
[02:09:40.820 --> 02:09:41.820]  Basically, everybody else does it.
[02:09:41.820 --> 02:09:46.820]  I'm not bragging, but we did trailblaze that.
[02:09:46.820 --> 02:09:49.820]  Now, they're basically having this first real debate the right way where it's just put out
[02:09:49.820 --> 02:09:55.820]  by an organization like League of Women Voters or a university or another group.
[02:09:55.820 --> 02:09:58.820]  A city or a state should host it.
[02:09:58.820 --> 02:09:59.820]  And then just here's the feed.
[02:09:59.820 --> 02:10:00.820]  Bring your cameras.
[02:10:00.820 --> 02:10:01.820]  Put it out.
[02:10:01.820 --> 02:10:06.820]  They're like, well, the production has to all be super slick and boom cameras and all this crap.
[02:10:06.820 --> 02:10:07.820]  No.
[02:10:07.820 --> 02:10:08.820]  A bunch of cameras at people.
[02:10:08.820 --> 02:10:12.820]  Jack into an audio feed and let's get this party started.
[02:10:12.820 --> 02:10:14.820]  That's the way it's supposed to be.
[02:10:14.820 --> 02:10:16.820]  And more and more, that's happening.
[02:10:16.820 --> 02:10:19.820]  So I'm very excited about this.
[02:10:19.820 --> 02:10:25.820]  By the way, I'm also excited about our new free app that has video feeds, audio feeds,
[02:10:25.820 --> 02:10:26.820]  special reports.
[02:10:26.820 --> 02:10:28.820]  It's going to have exclusive feeds soon.
[02:10:28.820 --> 02:10:29.820]  It's already got the function.
[02:10:29.820 --> 02:10:32.820]  I'm going to be launching them in the next few weeks.
[02:10:32.820 --> 02:10:40.820]  Infowars.com forward slash app or go to the Apple store or go to the Google Play Store.
[02:10:40.820 --> 02:10:45.820]  It's already number 30 in the free apps section.
[02:10:45.820 --> 02:10:56.820]  Right behind two points behind two places behind Xbox, a couple places ahead of Google,
[02:10:56.820 --> 02:10:57.820]  Google video play.
[02:10:57.820 --> 02:10:59.820]  Think about that.
[02:10:59.820 --> 02:11:02.820]  So two days in this app is even bigger than I thought it would be.
[02:11:02.820 --> 02:11:04.820]  It's absolutely free.
[02:11:04.820 --> 02:11:15.820]  So if you're interested in getting into the info wars.com forward slash app, and what I'm asking you to do is send info wars.com forward slash app that link to your friends, your family, mass text them.
[02:11:15.820 --> 02:11:18.820]  People don't really open emails like they open text.
[02:11:18.820 --> 02:11:33.820]  Load it into your phone, do a mass text and say, Hey, an independent pro America pro sovereignty pro prosperity pro second amendment news organization that already reaches 30 million people a week has launched a free app.
[02:11:33.820 --> 02:11:35.820]  It's already amazing.
[02:11:35.820 --> 02:11:38.820]  I mean, people don't put out free apps like this.
[02:11:38.820 --> 02:11:39.820]  That's why it's already rising.
[02:11:39.820 --> 02:11:42.820]  I mean, it'll probably be in the top 10 in a week at this rate.
[02:11:42.820 --> 02:11:47.820]  They're saying it might go to number one folks and this is unheard of because we spent hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[02:11:47.820 --> 02:11:48.820]  People don't do that.
[02:11:48.820 --> 02:11:54.820]  They spend, you know, $5,000 and put out a free app that has, you know, an audio feed and a, you know, list of articles.
[02:11:54.820 --> 02:11:58.820]  That's what we've done before with our old app that had over a million downloads and it's still available.
[02:11:58.820 --> 02:12:04.820]  It's available right at info wars.com forward slash show where you have all the different feeds and live video feeds and other stuff.
[02:12:04.820 --> 02:12:11.820]  But info wars.com forward slash app is where you can go and then send that link on to others and say, Hey, I've downloaded the app.
[02:12:11.820 --> 02:12:14.820]  You know, I like it or it's amazing or I hate it, whatever you think of it.
[02:12:14.820 --> 02:12:17.820]  And you should check this out.
[02:12:17.820 --> 02:12:18.820]  It's free.
[02:12:18.820 --> 02:12:27.820]  See this show four hours a day 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. central or 12 noon Eastern to 4 p.m. or, you know, a mountain or Pacific, whatever time you're in.
[02:12:27.820 --> 02:12:29.820]  Tell folks they can simply tune in.
[02:12:29.820 --> 02:12:34.820]  And then it's got all these articles and all these other videos and feeds and special reports.
[02:12:34.820 --> 02:12:40.820]  And this is part of the new media taking over and displacing the old corrupt media.
[02:12:40.820 --> 02:12:41.820]  It's already happening.
[02:12:41.820 --> 02:12:44.820]  I mean, you don't think the New York Times launches a new app.
[02:12:44.820 --> 02:12:50.820]  And in two days, it's like number 30 in the free apps of all time in the, in the, in the Apple store.
[02:12:50.820 --> 02:12:56.820]  No, this is because we really do have millions of people listening every 15 minutes.
[02:12:56.820 --> 02:12:58.820]  We really do have 30 million listeners a week.
[02:12:58.820 --> 02:13:01.820]  We really do have 5 billion views on YouTube.
[02:13:01.820 --> 02:13:05.820]  We really are kicking butt because you are kicking butt.
[02:13:05.820 --> 02:13:07.820]  You are the audience that are active.
[02:13:07.820 --> 02:13:12.820]  When you watch this debate Monday, it's not like watching some Super Bowl of 80 million viewers.
[02:13:12.820 --> 02:13:14.820]  And then what do you do?
[02:13:14.820 --> 02:13:19.820]  Wear your team's jersey, pay a bunch of money to be part of something you're not part of.
[02:13:19.820 --> 02:13:23.820]  This is your country, your vote, a populist fighting a globalist.
[02:13:23.820 --> 02:13:27.820]  You're on the field with Donald Trump.
[02:13:27.820 --> 02:13:28.820]  They're such liars.
[02:13:28.820 --> 02:13:33.820]  They probably can't even field their corpse of a candidate.
[02:13:33.820 --> 02:13:34.820]  This is history.
[02:13:34.820 --> 02:13:37.820]  When you spread a link, that's information war.
[02:13:37.820 --> 02:13:44.820]  You get one of your friends, neighbors, colleagues, family, random people, you name it, to download this free app on their droid or iPhone.
[02:13:44.820 --> 02:13:52.820]  You've taken the globalist platform of surveillance and control and taken that weapon away and turned it right back against them.
[02:13:52.820 --> 02:13:54.820]  Think about that.
[02:13:54.820 --> 02:13:56.820]  Long and hard.
[02:13:56.820 --> 02:13:58.820]  It's a beautiful thing.
[02:13:58.820 --> 02:14:03.820]  And then now, every day, they tune in a couple of times, it's over.
[02:14:03.820 --> 02:14:06.820]  Because they're going to hear the unpolished truth.
[02:14:06.820 --> 02:14:08.820]  They're going to hear the unvarnished truth.
[02:14:08.820 --> 02:14:10.820]  They're going to connect with it.
[02:14:10.820 --> 02:14:11.820]  They're going to hear it.
[02:14:11.820 --> 02:14:12.820]  Maybe they don't like me.
[02:14:12.820 --> 02:14:15.820]  They're going to like Leanne McAdoo or David Nider, Paul Watson.
[02:14:15.820 --> 02:14:16.820]  Who knows?
[02:14:16.820 --> 02:14:20.820]  They'll tune in Michael Savage or Matt Drudge pops in or Ron Paul.
[02:14:20.820 --> 02:14:24.820]  And they'll connect with the different crew members and the different ideas.
[02:14:24.820 --> 02:14:27.820]  And they'll share information with us and then see it, put out to millions.
[02:14:27.820 --> 02:14:30.820]  They'll understand what it is to be free and open and real.
[02:14:30.820 --> 02:14:32.820]  They'll understand there is a resistance.
[02:14:32.820 --> 02:14:36.820]  They'll understand there's a war and they'll click with it because they already knew it was going on.
[02:14:36.820 --> 02:14:38.820]  But nobody told them they were right.
[02:14:38.820 --> 02:14:44.820]  Every signal was to tell them they were wrong.
[02:14:44.820 --> 02:14:46.820]  Get the free app.
[02:14:46.820 --> 02:14:50.820]  I'm saying this all 20% off as people.

[02:14:53.820 --> 02:14:54.820]  Five star reviews on third party sites.

[02:15:01.820 --> 02:15:02.820]  Guys.

[02:15:05.820 --> 02:15:06.820]  I'm going to play this.
[02:15:06.820 --> 02:15:10.820]  Paul Watson report and then go right back to your calls Anthony and others that are holding,
[02:15:10.820 --> 02:15:11.820]  talking about the debate.
[02:15:11.820 --> 02:15:12.820]  Will Hillary Clinton make it?
[02:15:12.820 --> 02:15:19.200]  And then we've got the man attack while predicting ISIS attack in New York was basically a profit. That's coming up
[02:15:19.900 --> 02:15:27.240]  We've got a bunch of medical news John Boehner openly sells out the communist Chinese as if we didn't already know that all this and more
[02:15:28.700 --> 02:15:34.200]  In a police shooting that I think was not justified and is very shameful in the police. We're just freaking out
[02:15:34.780 --> 02:15:40.020]  This guy's like fixing his stalled car father of four no criminal record a Christian
[02:15:40.020 --> 02:15:42.660]  Well, it's way back from church. I'm told and
[02:15:44.100 --> 02:15:48.860]  The cops freak out on him and say, you know, basically stay there and he does and they just shoot him
[02:15:48.940 --> 02:15:51.860]  You shouldn't hire trigger happy cowards to be cops
[02:15:52.660 --> 02:15:56.500]  And I've seen it for myself. You don't want to hire a bunch of maniacs and I agree
[02:15:56.500 --> 02:16:01.580]  It's a tough job and a dangerous job and a rough job. I wouldn't want I'd probably turn into a basket case in a year or two
[02:16:01.580 --> 02:16:06.900]  But man, you just can't gun fathers down for no reason George Soros is gonna jump all over this now
[02:16:06.900 --> 02:16:11.860]  But hey, this this happens out there. You gotta look at the statistics
[02:16:12.660 --> 02:16:15.820]  But what's happening in the Carolinas? We're we're trying to look at that
[02:16:15.820 --> 02:16:20.540]  That's definitely racial and people being drug out of vehicles an attack is of what color they are because a black cop shot
[02:16:20.540 --> 02:16:22.660]  A black guy. We don't know that it tells there either
[02:16:22.660 --> 02:16:27.780]  But what we do know is they're planning race war on this country their own emails admitted George Soros has admit that
[02:16:27.900 --> 02:16:34.660]  They're pushing violent attacks on Hillary, but still then blame on yours truly and others implying. I want violence against her. I
[02:16:34.660 --> 02:16:38.460]  Don't want any violence against Hillary. I actually feel sorry for the demon
[02:16:38.980 --> 02:16:43.780]  But I certainly don't want her to become a martyr. Let's go to Paul Joseph Watson's latest report
[02:16:44.460 --> 02:16:48.580]  The Clintons are like Frank and Claire Underwood on steroids
[02:16:48.660 --> 02:16:54.220]  You have a guy who literally got away with raping women and went on to become president
[02:16:54.220 --> 02:17:01.060]  Bill and Hillary have been directly connected with numerous murders. They've intimidated victims into silence
[02:17:01.060 --> 02:17:06.540]  It would be incredibly naive to put anything past them with the polls almost a dead heat
[02:17:06.780 --> 02:17:13.540]  Hillary will contrive and exploit a shocking October surprise in a desperate effort to sink Trump
[02:17:13.580 --> 02:17:16.900]  This dirty trick could involve one of two scenarios
[02:17:16.900 --> 02:17:24.100]  Maybe even both Hillary could lean on her allies in the White House to provocateur a major military escalation with Russia
[02:17:24.300 --> 02:17:28.700]  Maybe even staging the shootdown of a Russian or American jet
[02:17:28.700 --> 02:17:33.140]  It wouldn't be the first time that such a drastic ploy has been considered
[02:17:33.140 --> 02:17:38.580]  We're already seeing the warning signs for this emerging out of Syria. Hillary will then label Trump
[02:17:39.460 --> 02:17:42.020]  Anti-American and claim he's in bed with Putin
[02:17:42.020 --> 02:17:45.740]  But the more likely scenario is that you could have a Trump supporting
[02:17:45.740 --> 02:17:54.300]  Maga hat-wearing Pepe the Frog memeing white supremacist go into a black area and shoot up a school full of children
[02:17:54.300 --> 02:18:00.540]  You could have a group of Trump supporters caught on camera dishing out a brutal beating to an African-American
[02:18:01.060 --> 02:18:08.140]  Rodney King style and it doesn't have to be a conspiracy or a false flag for this to happen for nearly a year
[02:18:08.140 --> 02:18:16.060]  The media has pushed the narrative that Donald Trump is quote literally Hitler and that his supporters are brown shirt Nazis
[02:18:16.060 --> 02:18:20.620]  Any moment that I have to call Trump out for being an inheritor to Hitler
[02:18:20.620 --> 02:18:28.660]  I will not only has that kind of reckless rhetoric emboldened extremists on the left to threaten and plan assassination attempts against Trump
[02:18:28.700 --> 02:18:37.380]  It's also emboldened actual neo-Nazis on the far right to think they can grease the skids for the reincarnation of adult Hitler
[02:18:37.380 --> 02:18:41.500]  So don't be surprised if and when one of them goes postal
[02:18:41.500 --> 02:18:47.540]  That's the environment the media and the left has created by equating Trump with Hitler
[02:18:47.540 --> 02:18:51.380]  People wonder why Hillary suddenly started talking about the alt-right
[02:18:54.380 --> 02:18:59.180]  Why her official campaign website suddenly started obsessing about Pepe the Frog
[02:18:59.180 --> 02:19:03.300]  Why she bizarrely claimed the alt-right was being run by Vladimir Putin
[02:19:03.300 --> 02:19:09.300]  What is she doing? Does she not know the one basic rule that you don't feed the trolls?
[02:19:09.300 --> 02:19:16.100]  What she's doing is setting the stage to exploit a military escalation with Russia to embarrass Trump
[02:19:16.100 --> 02:19:23.300]  Or a violent incident or series of incidents that will be blamed on Trump supporters to demonize Trump
[02:19:23.300 --> 02:19:32.300]  She's creating the narrative in the minds of undecided voters that the alt-right is dangerous, unhinged and that it's about to violently lash out
[02:19:32.300 --> 02:19:36.780]  Remember, they tried to pull this same stunt before Brexit
[02:19:36.780 --> 02:19:43.180]  Joe Cox, the anti-Brexit leftist, murdered by a racist right-wing Brexiteer
[02:19:43.180 --> 02:19:48.820]  Of course, he actually turned out to be a barely political mentally unstable person, but that didn't matter
[02:19:48.820 --> 02:19:56.180]  The media sold the narrative and the media will dismiss everything I just said as another right-wing conspiracy theory
[02:19:56.180 --> 02:20:00.620]  Just as they claimed Hillary's ill health was a baseless conspiracy theory
[02:20:00.620 --> 02:20:02.420]  And look how that turned out
[02:20:02.420 --> 02:20:05.820]  We're truly entering wag the dog territory
[02:20:05.820 --> 02:20:08.620]  Either there will be a major escalation with Russia
[02:20:08.620 --> 02:20:16.380]  Or we're going to see Trump supporters framed and blamed for violent racist attacks, domestic terror and murder
[02:20:16.380 --> 02:20:19.660]  Hillary Clinton is completely ruthless
[02:20:19.660 --> 02:20:23.500]  She will resort to anything to become president
[02:20:23.500 --> 02:20:39.500]  Anyone who denies that is dangerously naive
[02:20:53.500 --> 02:21:19.500]  They're telling you that they control reality and you've got to basically say down is up or black is white or 2 plus 2 equals 5 or 10 or 15 if they say so
[02:21:19.500 --> 02:21:26.500]  And they're angry that they know bringing in millions of Muslims into the Europe and the United States from war-torn areas
[02:21:26.500 --> 02:21:33.500]  That some of these people are going to start stabbing and bombing and going up and raping women in miniskirts because that's what they do in their country
[02:21:33.500 --> 02:21:37.500]  They just want to use that as a way to then take our rights domestically
[02:21:37.500 --> 02:21:39.500]  They don't want to have that be a big national issue
[02:21:39.500 --> 02:21:45.500]  But Trump creates a real narrative where he comes out and says
[02:21:45.500 --> 02:21:50.500]  There's going to be more terror attacks as you bring more people in from these countries
[02:21:50.500 --> 02:21:52.500]  That's 2 plus 2 equals 4
[02:21:52.500 --> 02:21:54.500]  They're angry he's doing that narrative
[02:21:54.500 --> 02:22:06.500]  So what Paul Watson is getting at here is that before they do a PR rollout, a false flag, a staged event or seize on a real event that took place
[02:22:06.500 --> 02:22:11.500]  They prep the ground, they get ready for a PR rollout
[02:22:11.500 --> 02:22:16.500]  And if you're in media and you study this, you learn how to see it and from a mile away, they're saying
[02:22:16.500 --> 02:22:21.500]  People are planning violence against Hillary, Alex Jones wants violence against Hillary
[02:22:21.500 --> 02:22:26.500]  The alt media wants violence against Hillary, the alt media are Nazis, the alt media should be arrested
[02:22:26.500 --> 02:22:34.500]  The alt media work for Putin, the alt media, the alt media and they are hammering this narrative that Donald Trump threatened Hillary, did you hear?
[02:22:34.500 --> 02:22:37.500]  He said she should just give up her bodyguards and see what happens
[02:22:37.500 --> 02:22:43.500]  They didn't give the full quote of if she wants to take your guns, but she's got government paid for bodyguards
[02:22:43.500 --> 02:22:46.500]  Let her give up her guards and see what happens
[02:22:46.500 --> 02:22:53.500]  Clearly that means she's being hypocritical, being elitist, having government paid for, citizen paid for bodyguards
[02:22:53.500 --> 02:22:58.500]  But you can't protect yourself in a war-torn area like Chicago or DC
[02:22:58.500 --> 02:23:01.500]  But they turn that into the narrative by editing it
[02:23:01.500 --> 02:23:08.500]  Did you hear? Donald Trump wants to hurt Hillary so that when they wind up a mental patient, a surhand surhand or whatever
[02:23:08.500 --> 02:23:12.500]  To go after Hillary, there's an attempt and it turns out it's a Trump supporter
[02:23:12.500 --> 02:23:18.500]  Now the truth is, they covered up this guy who was a anti-Trumper that reportedly bombed New York and New Jersey
[02:23:18.500 --> 02:23:21.500]  They covered up his father trying to stop him
[02:23:21.500 --> 02:23:25.500]  They covered up all of this because that doesn't fit into their narrative
[02:23:25.500 --> 02:23:30.500]  Because here's their problem, they're bringing a jihadist in
[02:23:30.500 --> 02:23:33.500]  Jihadists don't wait to get orders
[02:23:33.500 --> 02:23:38.500]  They're not totally controlled by the globalists, just like a bag of black widows you put in your neighbor's bed
[02:23:38.500 --> 02:23:41.500]  Aren't taking orders from you, they're just going to bite your neighbor when they go to sleep at night
[02:23:41.500 --> 02:23:43.500]  Or putting a rattlesnake in their bed, the same deal
[02:23:43.500 --> 02:23:48.500]  The rattlesnakes aren't taking orders, you just put it in the cab of their truck or whatever to bite them
[02:23:48.500 --> 02:23:51.500]  Hoping it would, maybe it will, maybe it won't
[02:23:51.500 --> 02:23:55.500]  You bring in millions of rattlesnakes, you're going to get some people getting bit
[02:23:55.500 --> 02:24:04.500]  Okay, so they gave nerve gas to Al Qaeda and now ISIS to attack the government
[02:24:04.500 --> 02:24:11.500]  They thought you were so dumb that when they attacked the Syrian government, our media said that the Syrian government had attacked itself
[02:24:11.500 --> 02:24:19.500]  But then it turned out Al Qaeda did videos launching the mortars, Allah Akbar, thank God for the chemical weapons in Arabic
[02:24:19.500 --> 02:24:28.500]  And so that blew up in Obama's face because they're trying to work with a bunch of lunatics who aren't trained spies
[02:24:28.500 --> 02:24:35.500]  Now, you know why they do that? They can't get CIA and FBI people to commit these types of crimes, on average, they just can't do it
[02:24:35.500 --> 02:24:42.500]  They create special groups of leftists that will do terror attacks in Oklahoma City, but then the FBI and the local police end up exposing it
[02:24:42.500 --> 02:24:48.500]  I mean, people want to bash the FBI and I'm not lionizing it, but we know all about Oklahoma City because of the FBI and the local police
[02:24:48.500 --> 02:24:54.500]  I mean, the FBI just went public and outside of, quote, law released what happened
[02:24:54.500 --> 02:24:59.500]  Two FBI agents gave an interview of the LA Times and told the whole story of what happened
[02:24:59.500 --> 02:25:04.500]  And they were told to stand down and let that bomb go forward and they had on their conscience, well, the whistle
[02:25:04.500 --> 02:25:08.500]  So that's how we know all this, folks, and we know how they operate
[02:25:08.500 --> 02:25:16.500]  So they're having trouble getting the CIA and getting army officers and other people to go out and stage false flags
[02:25:16.500 --> 02:25:22.500]  So they've got to actually bring the radical Muslims in to do it, but they're not doing it at the proper time
[02:25:22.500 --> 02:25:29.500]  They're supposed to do it down the road as a sleeper cell army to destabilize the country and link up a Black Lives Matter and other combinations
[02:25:29.500 --> 02:25:39.500]  The Soros is openly funding, just like the Ukraine overthrow, but their little minions are so uncontrolled, they're actually doing it on their own
[02:25:39.500 --> 02:25:46.500]  The leadership of ISIS in al-Qaeda is globalist run, is globalist allied, I should say, not completely run
[02:25:46.500 --> 02:25:55.500]  But at the grassroots level, these bots, these minions, these zombie attackers, they're going out on their own and doing it
[02:25:55.500 --> 02:25:59.500]  And so that's why Hillary's unable to contain it, and believe me, she wishes she could
[02:25:59.500 --> 02:26:06.500]  Because those sleeper cells are meant if she loses and then Trump gets in, they're not meant to be activated at this time
[02:26:06.500 --> 02:26:11.500]  They don't want to just bring in a couple million, they want to bring in tens of millions and really conquer us down the road
[02:26:11.500 --> 02:26:22.500]  This is a more long-term plan, but again, when the Saudis gave al-Qaeda nerve gas, they had to show off their family and had to show off online what rock stars they were
[02:26:22.500 --> 02:26:30.500]  They don't want to meet Hollywood stars, they don't want to, you know, all that stuff, they want to be on YouTube launching a chemical attack
[02:26:30.500 --> 02:26:40.500]  And so, you know, they're just not good soldiers for the new World Order, you can't get the CIA to do it, you can't get, you know, anybody else to do it properly
[02:26:40.500 --> 02:26:49.500]  So now you've got to rely on people that literally come from places, so hillbilly, it brings a new term to the word hillbilly
[02:26:49.500 --> 02:26:54.500]  Alright, I'm going to go to some more phone calls now, and I've got more reports coming up, but let's go to some phone calls right now
[02:26:54.500 --> 02:26:59.500]  Let's talk to Anthony in Florida, thanks for holding, so will Hillary make the debate next Monday? That's the big question
[02:26:59.500 --> 02:27:10.500]  Well, yeah, I agree with you that it will do whatever it takes to either delay or even cancel it, because she obviously looks very, very sick
[02:27:10.500 --> 02:27:17.500]  I agree with you that it's literally right on a weekend at Bernie's, and she even has the sunglasses to go with it
[02:27:17.500 --> 02:27:37.500]  And I also want to make the point too that if you notice how at the September 11th, at the September 11th Memorial Service there, you see literally the moment she falls, you literally see a wall of Secret Service people trying to block
[02:27:37.500 --> 02:27:53.500]  Oh yeah, this is all well rehearsed, because this is going on a lot, that's what the Secret Service told us, they said we're not going to give you Secret stuff, just follow her around your reporters, watch what happens medically, the tints, the ambulances, she's falling down all the time, just catch it on tape
[02:27:53.500 --> 02:27:56.500]  Well, we did and somebody else did, God bless them
[02:27:56.500 --> 02:28:03.500]  Yeah, exactly, and that tape was not supposed to be seen, it was not supposed to be seen
[02:28:03.500 --> 02:28:18.500]  Yeah, and look, we don't have the budget, we've sent reporters to a couple of her events, they keep hundreds of yards back, Millie Weaver and her camera person were able to get into like 30 yards away and get her and the medical tent and everything else and the emergency stretchers and her having a medical event
[02:28:18.500 --> 02:28:30.500]  This guy was basically a Democratic supporter, I guess is why he was allowed, but well I tell you, and again the mainstream media cut the feed right at the point where she's just wobbling and then says that we made it up that she fell down
[02:28:30.500 --> 02:28:39.500]  No, she fell down on her face, three people could barely pick her up and then her feet are down behind her and so again that's why InfoWars needs financial support
[02:28:39.500 --> 02:28:46.500]  I want to be able to have a team of reporters all the time out there when big stories breaks to hound the system and find out what's really happening
[02:28:46.500 --> 02:28:52.500]  By the grace of God, citizen journalists everywhere are filling the gap, my friend, anything else, Anthony?
[02:28:52.500 --> 02:29:14.500]  Oh, yes, actually I was going to say, yeah, because I think that we call she, we call with Trump, Trump, Trump, I think Trump is going to do very, very well and because he's obviously a great speaker and yeah, I agree with you on all those points
[02:29:14.500 --> 02:29:31.500]  Alright brother, well we're going to find out, I mean we're only how many days, it's Wednesday, so we have Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, like four and a half days, and I mean it's like watching paint dry, but the opposite, it's like the paint's drying slowly but I can't wait to see when it's finally done, I mean it's torture
[02:29:31.500 --> 02:29:45.500]  So tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, you walk into this room and it's biblical in nature as Jezebel put forward by the establishment begins to disintegrate right as she's supposedly about to take the throne over America
[02:29:45.500 --> 02:29:49.500]  and all the time just crediting the mainstream media that's trying to prop her up
[02:29:49.500 --> 02:29:53.500]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.500 --> 02:29:57.500]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.500 --> 02:30:04.500]  Capitol Hill lawmakers are horn-locked in a bitter battle this week,
[02:30:04.500 --> 02:30:11.500]  one side trying to block President Obama's bid to sell 1.15 billion in U.S. arms to Saudi Arabia.
[02:30:11.500 --> 02:30:14.500]  The massive sale of tanks, guns, and other military equipment to the Saudis
[02:30:14.500 --> 02:30:17.500]  has driven a wedge among U.S. lawmakers,
[02:30:17.500 --> 02:30:21.500]  some on the Hill calling Rydia a good ally while others saying its occupation of Yemen
[02:30:21.500 --> 02:30:24.500]  is most assuredly where these weapons will be used.
[02:30:24.500 --> 02:30:28.500]  We know the Saudis hit Yemeni hospitals, schools, and other civilian targets.
[02:30:28.500 --> 02:30:34.500]  Senator Rand Paul from Kentucky said he pushed to end the U.S. assistance to Saudi Arabia in the war in Yemen.
[02:30:34.500 --> 02:30:40.500]  Paul says, quote, this is part of a larger effort by many of us to say that Congress is not only relevant,
[02:30:40.500 --> 02:30:43.500]  but has the primary role and duty of the initiation of war.
[02:30:43.500 --> 02:30:46.500]  All of this while the President is preaching, quote, tough love to the Saudis,
[02:30:46.500 --> 02:30:49.500]  this tough love doesn't include deals like this, of course.
[02:30:49.500 --> 02:30:54.500]  Obama has sold more advanced weaponry to Saudi leaders than any of his predecessors,
[02:30:54.500 --> 02:30:56.500]  despite their atrocious human rights record.
[02:30:56.500 --> 02:30:59.500]  I'm Margaret Howell reporting for Infowars.com.
[02:30:59.500 --> 02:31:03.500]  Brainforce, it's completely different. Try a bottle of it.
[02:31:03.500 --> 02:31:09.500]  Rob Doe joins us. You worked, I guess, like 20-plus hours. Tell us what brainforce did.
[02:31:09.500 --> 02:31:12.500]  I've been working all day. I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[02:31:12.500 --> 02:31:17.500]  I get in here at 8.30. I was kind of run down. You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it.
[02:31:17.500 --> 02:31:21.500]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview. I got my bottle of brainforce right there.
[02:31:21.500 --> 02:31:26.500]  I popped two of them. And about 20 minutes later, it's like, bing, everything just kind of clears up.
[02:31:26.500 --> 02:31:29.500]  It's got four and a half stars. People really love it.
[02:31:29.500 --> 02:31:34.500]  Read about it. Find out why third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise,
[02:31:34.500 --> 02:31:39.500]  because it really does have the best organic-based systems that will blow your socks off.
[02:31:39.500 --> 02:31:43.500]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without brainforce.
[02:31:43.500 --> 02:31:49.500]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more brainforce and came in.
[02:31:49.500 --> 02:32:10.500]  You will find brainforce and other game-changing products at infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:32:19.500 --> 02:32:22.500]  Now you can do so with Infowars Live anywhere you go.
[02:32:22.500 --> 02:32:27.500]  You can browse the news, share content and more. And best of all, it's free to download at infowars.com.
[02:32:27.500 --> 02:32:32.500]  The app is brand new. This is the first release. And it was completely built from the ground up.
[02:32:32.500 --> 02:32:36.500]  We've seen example after example of cable news networks that tipped into deceiving you.
[02:32:36.500 --> 02:32:40.500]  In short, the mainstream media is being covertly manipulated by well-financed political forces
[02:32:40.500 --> 02:32:45.500]  who are trying to sway public opinion in a natural direction that only serves establishment agendas.
[02:32:45.500 --> 02:32:50.500]  But Infowars Live is the solution to the controlled press that is rapidly losing influence.
[02:32:50.500 --> 02:33:19.500]  So download Infowars Live today at infowars.com and learn what's really going on instead of being spoon-fed lies by the mainstream media.
[02:33:20.500 --> 02:33:30.500]  Again, Infowars will be getting the feed directly from the debate coming up next week
[02:33:30.500 --> 02:33:34.500]  because it's going to be a free-to-all media when we're going to have live coverage of it.
[02:33:34.500 --> 02:33:38.500]  We won't be talking over the whole thing. When one group is running it, if we're going to carry it,
[02:33:38.500 --> 02:33:43.500]  we have to then give live commentary basically to 67% of it. And that's how we do it, fair use.
[02:33:43.500 --> 02:33:48.500]  But more and more of that model is being broken by our actions and other actions.
[02:33:48.500 --> 02:33:53.500]  And so they're going to where basically anybody can subscribe and get the raw feed.
[02:33:53.500 --> 02:33:58.500]  So we'll be covering that next Monday, an hour before the debate, during the debate,
[02:33:58.500 --> 02:34:02.500]  and several hours after the debate with analysis and taking your phone calls.
[02:34:02.500 --> 02:34:08.500]  The real thing we're going to do is, and I'll be here the whole time,
[02:34:08.500 --> 02:34:12.500]  is we're going to sit there with Hillary's lies and already knowing her main agenda
[02:34:12.500 --> 02:34:17.500]  with video showing her lies and articles showing her lies with lots of quick clips
[02:34:17.500 --> 02:34:22.500]  so that as soon as the debate's over, we'll have all that lined up to show you
[02:34:22.500 --> 02:34:26.500]  or as soon as she collapses or doesn't come out of the bathroom or whatever,
[02:34:26.500 --> 02:34:29.500]  we'll have the video with quick commentary up, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,
[02:34:29.500 --> 02:34:33.500]  to a page with highlights like instant replay as it's happening.
[02:34:33.500 --> 02:34:36.500]  And nobody else is going to do that. They're going to wait and watch during the debate
[02:34:36.500 --> 02:34:39.500]  and do it after. We're going to be doing it during it.
[02:34:39.500 --> 02:34:44.500]  That's the real game changer. I predict 20 million views just doing that.
[02:34:44.500 --> 02:34:47.500]  And people are like, why are you telling us your secrets?
[02:34:47.500 --> 02:34:49.500]  I've known all this stuff forever and never implemented it.
[02:34:49.500 --> 02:34:52.500]  I haven't had the crew or the people. We're doing it with the skeleton crew.
[02:34:52.500 --> 02:34:54.500]  I want you to do it too.
[02:34:54.500 --> 02:34:57.500]  That's what this is all about. I'm not in competition with people.
[02:34:57.500 --> 02:35:01.500]  It's like a disease of like, oh my gosh, Breitbart might cover it live
[02:35:01.500 --> 02:35:06.500]  or Drudge will have a link to it. I'm the one. I'm the one with the fee.
[02:35:06.500 --> 02:35:10.500]  I'm not battling about who has the feed.
[02:35:10.500 --> 02:35:14.500]  I'm battling about the globalist wanting to take my guns,
[02:35:14.500 --> 02:35:17.500]  dumb me down, conquer humanity, put in driverless cars,
[02:35:17.500 --> 02:35:22.500]  phase humans out in their own words for a post-industrial world.
[02:35:22.500 --> 02:35:25.500]  That's the big diabolical plan. That's what we're exposing.
[02:35:25.500 --> 02:35:28.500]  That's what we're saying no to. That's what we're doing.
[02:35:28.500 --> 02:35:32.500]  I'll get my info out any way I can.
[02:35:32.500 --> 02:35:35.500]  I get calls all the time from talk shows around the country, TV, radio,
[02:35:35.500 --> 02:35:39.500]  they go, can we use some of the clips from your show in our intro?
[02:35:39.500 --> 02:35:42.500]  And I go, of course you can. Don't ask me. It's fair use anyways.
[02:35:42.500 --> 02:35:46.500]  I'm a public figure. I'm well known in not going after people,
[02:35:46.500 --> 02:35:50.500]  not territorializing things, not infighting.
[02:35:50.500 --> 02:35:53.500]  But I'll get calls like, our business wants to put up a billboard
[02:35:53.500 --> 02:35:57.500]  with infowars.com or the local station you're on. Is that okay?
[02:35:57.500 --> 02:36:04.500]  Yes, but you don't need my permission to put up a link to my website. Thank you.
[02:36:04.500 --> 02:36:08.500]  You don't need my permission to put up a billboard for the local radio station.
[02:36:08.500 --> 02:36:11.500]  I'll tell them and see, you know, if they've gotten the input on how to help you,
[02:36:11.500 --> 02:36:19.500]  but people are so timid and we have to be bold in this fight.
[02:36:19.500 --> 02:36:23.500]  Now I'm going to go back to your calls, Shane and Oregon and others here in just a moment.
[02:36:23.500 --> 02:36:30.500]  But first, man attacked while predicting ISIS attack was a profit.
[02:36:30.500 --> 02:36:34.500]  The story is up on infowars.com.
[02:36:34.500 --> 02:36:39.500]  I wanted to get the date on this and I guess I never did. Can you guys pull up the article itself?
[02:36:39.500 --> 02:36:44.500]  And I can actually give folks, you know, but see that headline is today when we posted it.
[02:36:44.500 --> 02:36:48.500]  What I need to do is go to the video below it and click on it.
[02:36:48.500 --> 02:36:51.500]  And then I can give the YouTube date and then that was uploaded live that day.
[02:36:51.500 --> 02:36:54.500]  So just go to that video for me. Thank you. Go to the page.
[02:36:54.500 --> 02:36:57.500]  Again, I'm not bitching at the crew. That is something I forgot to do.
[02:36:57.500 --> 02:37:06.500]  And so this was April 14th, 2016. Oh, I get it.
[02:37:06.500 --> 02:37:09.500]  That was just a couple of months ago.
[02:37:09.500 --> 02:37:12.500]  So a couple of months ago, this fellow, we don't know his name.
[02:37:12.500 --> 02:37:17.500]  He's out there warning people that there's going to be an ISIS terror attack
[02:37:17.500 --> 02:37:23.500]  because we know I said that inside the quote refugees that they're shipping in their fighters.
[02:37:23.500 --> 02:37:27.500]  We know 80% of them are military aged men. Now the State Department, we played it earlier,
[02:37:27.500 --> 02:37:29.500]  has been forced to admit that that's currently happening.
[02:37:29.500 --> 02:37:36.500]  And this poor guy was out there with a bunch of white liberals and a bunch of black lives matter people.
[02:37:36.500 --> 02:37:39.500]  And they ended up physically, viciously assaulting him.
[02:37:39.500 --> 02:37:45.500]  The nine minute video, we're going to play it here in just a moment, parts of it.
[02:37:45.500 --> 02:37:48.500]  But the guy is simply out there with a make America great again,
[02:37:48.500 --> 02:37:53.500]  hand explaining that Trump is right about not letting radical jihadists enter completely unvetted.
[02:37:53.500 --> 02:37:58.500]  And he finally goes ahead and gets attacked because the media and the system has taught everybody,
[02:37:58.500 --> 02:38:04.500]  white people are evil inherently bad unless you're a white person denouncing yourself as evil.
[02:38:04.500 --> 02:38:10.500]  Okay. And then they indiscriminately get bombed and the New Yorkers are so dumbed down,
[02:38:10.500 --> 02:38:12.500]  they don't even know what's happened to them.
[02:38:12.500 --> 02:38:16.500]  So this is very, very sad. The video is up on info wars.com.
[02:38:16.500 --> 02:38:20.500]  But before months ago, I guess that's your point is was on the article.
[02:38:20.500 --> 02:38:22.500]  This patriot was wearing a New Yorkers,
[02:38:22.500 --> 02:38:26.500]  I was warning New Yorkers about the threat of ISIS attacks on US soil,
[02:38:26.500 --> 02:38:31.500]  and that Americans should arm themselves to be protected against the Islamic terrorist organization.
[02:38:31.500 --> 02:38:36.500]  He was then attacked by BLM in New York City.
[02:38:36.500 --> 02:38:41.500]  And again,
[02:38:41.500 --> 02:38:47.500]  I saw a liberal white trendy lady today with a Black Lives Matter bumper sticker on her car.
[02:38:47.500 --> 02:38:50.500]  The first time I saw it, he would shot some video over pulled up the side of her to see what she looked like.
[02:38:50.500 --> 02:38:55.500]  And she looked like a total prisoner of the cult that is political correctness.
[02:38:55.500 --> 02:39:01.500]  And literally thinks that everyone they shoot in the world is,
[02:39:01.500 --> 02:39:07.500]  I don't know, there's a hundred to something people killed a year about police that were illegitimate shootings.
[02:39:07.500 --> 02:39:09.500]  But let's just say it's higher than a couple hundred.
[02:39:09.500 --> 02:39:11.500]  That is not even a blip on the radar screen.
[02:39:11.500 --> 02:39:19.500]  Now you can take a story like Tulsa police shooting this poor Terrence Crutcher to death.
[02:39:19.500 --> 02:39:23.500]  And you see the video his cars broke down, they pull up the cops freak out on him.
[02:39:23.500 --> 02:39:25.500]  He puts his hands up and they shoot him.
[02:39:25.500 --> 02:39:31.500]  They put social justice warrior trendy wimps in his police that are so scared they'll shoot anything moving.
[02:39:31.500 --> 02:39:36.500]  And they're statistically even more likely to shoot whites because I guess they think they won't get in trouble doing that.
[02:39:36.500 --> 02:39:39.500]  So there are some trigger happy loons out there.
[02:39:39.500 --> 02:39:40.500]  Okay.
[02:39:40.500 --> 02:39:42.500]  And I've got a problem with them.
[02:39:42.500 --> 02:39:44.500]  They should pay this guy's, you know, family $10 million.
[02:39:44.500 --> 02:39:50.500]  I mean, you know, and these cops should get in trouble, get fired, get put in prison, whatever.
[02:39:50.500 --> 02:39:56.500]  But five days ago Tulsa police officer Betty Shelby.
[02:39:56.500 --> 02:40:03.500]  The 40 year shot a 40 year old unarmed black man after his car was found abandoned in the middle of the road.
[02:40:03.500 --> 02:40:09.500]  Federal state and local authorities have launched investigations into the officer involved shooting.
[02:40:09.500 --> 02:40:19.500]  Tiffany Crutcher, Terrence's twin sister had urged prosecutors to immediately press charges against Shelby, a five year veteran with the Tulsa police.
[02:40:19.500 --> 02:40:32.500]  Earlier this week Tulsa police released a video and audio recordings of the shooting since that happened, though attorneys for both the Crutcher family and Shelby have laid out conflicting accounts about what happened on the night.
[02:40:32.500 --> 02:40:36.500]  Of September 16. Well, there's video of it.
[02:40:36.500 --> 02:40:41.500]  Hands up, refusing commands was Crutcher high, open versus closed.
[02:40:41.500 --> 02:40:42.500]  It goes on and on.
[02:40:42.500 --> 02:40:47.500]  The point is, as we have helicopter video of it and the guy standing there, he's not rushing them.
[02:40:47.500 --> 02:40:48.500]  They kill him.
[02:40:48.500 --> 02:40:55.500]  And if you're so scared, you think a guy standing there who isn't attacking you or isn't making a move and you got to shoot him.
[02:40:55.500 --> 02:40:58.500]  Because his cars broke down the middle of the road.
[02:40:58.500 --> 02:40:59.500]  It's crazy.
[02:40:59.500 --> 02:41:05.500]  And let me tell you, it's scary when cops pull people over or pull you over and you see how scared they are when they're coming up to your car.
[02:41:05.500 --> 02:41:07.500]  And I get it, it's a dangerous job.
[02:41:07.500 --> 02:41:09.500]  I mean, okay, I understand you've got adrenaline.
[02:41:09.500 --> 02:41:18.500]  I understand people are trying to kill you, especially with Black Lives Matter and George Soros saying basically kill cops, which only makes it worse for black people, especially.
[02:41:18.500 --> 02:41:22.500]  And then the police, what really kills a lot of black people and other people for that matter.
[02:41:22.500 --> 02:41:28.500]  Other human beings on this planet is the police are slow rolling into all these dangerous neighborhoods because they don't want to get blamed or shot or killed.
[02:41:28.500 --> 02:41:31.500]  And so it's all a disaster.
[02:41:31.500 --> 02:41:33.500]  And the point is it's being exacerbated.
[02:41:33.500 --> 02:41:34.500]  It's being manipulated.
[02:41:34.500 --> 02:41:47.500]  It's being made worse by outside forces that want to take all of our anger at the corrupt government and make it all about local cops and a hundred and something innocent people they kill a year.
[02:41:47.500 --> 02:41:51.500]  The cops have stopped showing up in dangerous areas of Chicago.
[02:41:51.500 --> 02:41:55.500]  And the first nine months of this year now.
[02:41:55.500 --> 02:42:04.500]  They've gone from 300 to something blacks being shot on average in nine months to close to a thousand.
[02:42:04.500 --> 02:42:07.500]  It's like 1400 total now.
[02:42:07.500 --> 02:42:10.500]  I mean, it is hundreds and hundreds and hundreds dying.
[02:42:10.500 --> 02:42:14.500]  But let's see, it's okay if a black person kills another black person.
[02:42:14.500 --> 02:42:16.500]  It's bad if a white cop doesn't.
[02:42:16.500 --> 02:42:24.500]  But I want to know what's going on with the situation obviously in the Carolinas because that's a black cop doing that.
[02:42:24.500 --> 02:42:30.500]  So August was the most violent month in Chicago in 20 years.
[02:42:30.500 --> 02:42:35.500]  And it's not getting any better as things supposedly cool off into September.
[02:42:35.500 --> 02:42:40.500]  All right, let's go ahead and play this clip man attack wall predicting ISIS attack was a profit.
[02:42:40.500 --> 02:42:44.500]  And watching the video I'll narrate it for radio listeners.
[02:42:44.500 --> 02:42:53.500]  He's just out there politely warning people in a street preaching and folks build themselves up and then start beating the hell out of him.
[02:42:53.500 --> 02:43:01.500]  And it's just like watching videos or films of like weird clan people grabbing somebody and winding themselves up.
[02:43:01.500 --> 02:43:04.500]  But see, it's okay because quote their minority.
[02:43:04.500 --> 02:43:08.500]  So it's okay to get all wound up and attack the First Amendment of a guy simply trying to warn you.
[02:43:08.500 --> 02:43:18.500]  And I tell you if these black New Yorkers went to Libya, the Wahhabist say that black people are slaves and are not human.
[02:43:18.500 --> 02:43:20.500]  That's actually where that teaching came from.
[02:43:20.500 --> 02:43:28.500]  They started the slave trade on blacks and in the Quran blacks are bad mouth.
[02:43:28.500 --> 02:43:30.500]  So I don't and I'm not attacking black Muslims.
[02:43:30.500 --> 02:43:31.500]  I don't do that.
[02:43:31.500 --> 02:43:40.500]  I just don't get why it's the cool in sexy avant-garde thing and why people don't know their own history or what really went on.
[02:43:40.500 --> 02:43:53.500]  So if these black folks in New York got sent to Libya, they'd be killed by the al-Qaeda slash ISIS groups that are killing every black person they can get their hands on because they're claiming they have no right to be in North Africa.
[02:43:53.500 --> 02:43:56.500]  Even if they're Muslim, they're killed because they're black.
[02:43:56.500 --> 02:44:01.500]  So I want to understand that little tidbit as well.
[02:44:01.500 --> 02:44:03.500]  Just the absolute ignorance.
[02:44:03.500 --> 02:44:05.500]  Let's go ahead and play it.
[02:44:05.500 --> 02:44:16.500]  ISIS is here. Learn how to protect yourself. Learn how to protect your family. Learn how to shoot a firearm safe.
[02:44:16.500 --> 02:44:18.500]  Look at the liberal trend he's laughing at him.
[02:44:18.500 --> 02:44:20.500]  They don't change anything else.
[02:44:20.500 --> 02:44:26.500]  Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Learn how to defend yourself. Learn how to shoot a firearm.
[02:44:26.500 --> 02:44:28.500]  Like all those yuppies have lost everything they got.
[02:44:28.500 --> 02:44:40.500]  Trendy's thinking if you go along with the establishment you're a winner, no you're a loser. That's what they're making trendy culture about being poor and living in a 200 square foot apartment that you pay more for than a thousand foot apartment.
[02:44:40.500 --> 02:44:44.500]  And they're making all the new apartments all over without car parking spaces.
[02:44:44.500 --> 02:44:49.500]  Trendy's like it because they're in the cool club. They're called followers.
[02:44:49.500 --> 02:44:51.500]  Wake up! Wake up!
[02:44:51.500 --> 02:44:59.500]  And then that liberal life start really celebrating for the minorities during the journey of life. Start beating up the demon white. That's okay as long as Red Hat is the white guy.
[02:44:59.500 --> 02:45:02.500]  Learn how to protect your family.
[02:45:02.500 --> 02:45:04.500]  Go home. You have no speech.
[02:45:04.500 --> 02:45:06.500]  Go home. Go home. Go home.
[02:45:06.500 --> 02:45:08.500]  Go back to North Korea.
[02:45:08.500 --> 02:45:12.500]  Learn how to protect your family. Learn how to protect your family. Learn how to protect your family.
[02:45:12.500 --> 02:45:18.500]  Donald Trump races, which means doesn't submit to me and my racism. Doesn't roll over to me demanding everything free.
[02:45:18.500 --> 02:45:22.500]  This is gang psychology folks.
[02:45:22.500 --> 02:45:25.500]  As long as they say KKK they can beat him up.
[02:45:25.500 --> 02:45:30.500]  But I haven't had this guy on. I don't know who he is. He's a good mom. He's a listener.
[02:45:30.500 --> 02:45:36.500]  I bet he's a listener. I bet he's kind of a right wing Christian guy. Probably real pro-Israel.
[02:45:39.500 --> 02:45:43.500]  I love how the guy starts bumping into him but his hands are up.
[02:45:43.500 --> 02:45:49.500]  That's the mind control. He's pushing into him. He's pushing him out. But it's okay because this is a white devil.
[02:45:49.500 --> 02:45:55.500]  But it's alright because his hands are up. See, he's running into him but his hands are up so it's okay.
[02:45:55.500 --> 02:46:00.500]  The guy finally pushes him off and then now, oh, they assaulted him but they didn't.
[02:46:00.500 --> 02:46:04.500]  And now they can start attacking him.
[02:46:04.500 --> 02:46:06.500]  And then they start punching him.
[02:46:06.500 --> 02:46:11.500]  Look, oh, we have a social justice warrior with a little white twit who hates mommy and daddy.
[02:46:11.500 --> 02:46:14.500]  But we're not attacking. They always hold their hands up. Then they hit you.
[02:46:14.500 --> 02:46:16.500]  Oh, we hit you but our hands are up.
[02:46:16.500 --> 02:46:20.500]  It's all about language. It's all about they control symbols. They control everything.
[02:46:20.500 --> 02:46:25.500]  They control everything. So they come and they run into you just like the anti pro-lifer people.
[02:46:25.500 --> 02:46:31.500]  They run into people in wheelchairs and crutches and then say, oh, excuse me, why'd you assault me?
[02:46:31.500 --> 02:46:34.500]  Then they try to follow charges.
[02:46:34.500 --> 02:46:37.500]  They start slapping him and hitting him in the head.
[02:46:37.500 --> 02:46:41.500]  The full video is up on infowars.com for going to New York to warn them.
[02:46:41.500 --> 02:46:47.500]  A man who warns New Yorkers of ISIS threat is beat up.
[02:46:47.500 --> 02:46:51.500]  And it goes on. The brutal part is coming up. You can go see it.
[02:46:51.500 --> 02:46:56.500]  But it's all these wimps, all these social justice warriors and chicken-necked white people
[02:46:56.500 --> 02:47:02.500]  getting off on the fun of going out and finding a KKK even though he's not a KKK and beating him.
[02:47:02.500 --> 02:47:07.500]  They're like, oh, this is really fun. Oh, there was a terror attack, ISIS.
[02:47:07.500 --> 02:47:13.500]  That's the group that has literally nothing to do with Islam.
[02:47:13.500 --> 02:47:18.500]  Shane and Oregon, thanks for holding my friend here on the air.
[02:47:18.500 --> 02:47:20.500]  Hey, how are you doing? Thanks for taking my call.
[02:47:20.500 --> 02:47:22.500]  Thank you, brother.
[02:47:22.500 --> 02:47:27.500]  Hey, man, I'm all over the board. I got so much. I want to say, but let me give you a couple things.
[02:47:27.500 --> 02:47:32.500]  First of all, I'm a 13-year veteran in the United States Army.
[02:47:32.500 --> 02:47:36.500]  I got the nutraceuticals, things that I can get right now.
[02:47:36.500 --> 02:47:39.500]  And I'm telling you, I absolutely love them.
[02:47:39.500 --> 02:47:48.500]  I currently have the liver cleanse and liver shield, B-12, and the supermail vitality in X-2.
[02:47:48.500 --> 02:47:51.500]  Well, thank you, sir, because they're great products. They're game changers.
[02:47:51.500 --> 02:47:53.500]  But regardless, you're funding our operation.
[02:47:53.500 --> 02:47:55.500]  So again, it's a total win-win.
[02:47:55.500 --> 02:47:58.500]  You are the info war. Thank you for the support.
[02:47:58.500 --> 02:48:01.500]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:48:01.500 --> 02:48:08.500]  You know, I listen to you every day. I have a fairly easy job. I'm a disabled veteran.
[02:48:08.500 --> 02:48:13.500]  But my job is basically, I drive all day long and for about 10 hours.
[02:48:13.500 --> 02:48:16.500]  So I'm streaming, listening to you.
[02:48:16.500 --> 02:48:19.500]  I can't wait till 9 o'clock in the morning when you come on the radio.
[02:48:19.500 --> 02:48:25.500]  I listen through the app and I listen up until the end and then after your show's over, after the fourth hour,
[02:48:25.500 --> 02:48:31.500]  I go into, you know, other videos, things that you have as endless amounts of things that I can watch.
[02:48:31.500 --> 02:48:35.500]  And I really, really appreciate it. I can't explain how important it is.
[02:48:35.500 --> 02:48:38.500]  Well, sir, well, thank God you care. Thank God you're involved.
[02:48:38.500 --> 02:48:41.500]  Please pass the videos on. Wake up other people.
[02:48:41.500 --> 02:48:44.500]  Tell folks about the new free app. It's even better than the old app, which is still great.
[02:48:44.500 --> 02:48:50.500]  Infowars.com or slash app, because that's the next level of spreading the word, which I bet you're already doing.
[02:48:50.500 --> 02:48:58.500]  Yes, definitely. I sent, I sent the new, the new app out in a mass text through most of everybody in my.
[02:48:58.500 --> 02:49:02.500]  Well, it's having an effect. It's going to be number one, I guess, soon.
[02:49:02.500 --> 02:49:06.500]  It's like number 30 on the iTunes store right now.
[02:49:06.500 --> 02:49:11.500]  Well, you know, and it should be because people are waking up. I have friends in law enforcement.
[02:49:11.500 --> 02:49:17.500]  I have military friends. Everybody's waking up and really starting to see what's truthfully going on out there.
[02:49:17.500 --> 02:49:26.500]  And, you know, one of my concerns with Hillary is I'm not only my concern that she's not going to make it to somehow make it to this debate,
[02:49:26.500 --> 02:49:30.500]  which, you know, I think that's all by design. She's not going to make it to this debate.
[02:49:30.500 --> 02:49:38.500]  But I think they're going to wait to the last couple of weeks right up to the election and actually pull her out and try to postpone the election.
[02:49:38.500 --> 02:49:43.500]  I mean, I agree with you. I think all that's in the cards. We're seeing things that have never before been done.
[02:49:43.500 --> 02:49:51.500]  We got 47 days left. Who do you think will try to put in? Cain, Biden, Bernie Sanders?
[02:49:51.500 --> 02:49:55.500]  Rob, you may think this is silly, but what if they tried to put Michelle Obama in there?
[02:49:55.500 --> 02:50:03.500]  That's what actually Roger Stone is always so on target. He says that's the word. They're actually floating that around in D.C. right now.
[02:50:03.500 --> 02:50:14.500]  I mean, the reason I think that is because, you know, it would still be the woman on the card as zombified as the followers are for Hillary.
[02:50:14.500 --> 02:50:22.500]  You know, I think they would identify, cross-identify Michelle Obama with Hillary and just simply vote for her because, well, she's already in there.
[02:50:22.500 --> 02:50:28.500]  She's, you know, kind of, she's in that whole sector of people. And that's just kind of why I think that.
[02:50:28.500 --> 02:50:33.500]  A lot of folks think that God bless you, sir, and God bless you for what you've done for this Republic chain.
[02:50:33.500 --> 02:50:41.500]  We appreciate you. We're going to go to break and come back with all the longest Rick and then Adam, Maggie, Dave and others.
[02:50:41.500 --> 02:50:48.500]  And then just coming in to take over in the fourth hour, David Knight, always fiery, always focused, always on target.
[02:50:48.500 --> 02:50:52.500]  I'm Alan Jones with infowars.com. And yes, the new app is free.
[02:50:52.500 --> 02:51:00.500]  It's infowars live on droid and on iPhone devices, taking their little devices and making them do something good.

[02:52:56.500 --> 02:53:02.500]  There is an affordable alternative to the high cost of healthcare that offers
[02:53:02.500 --> 02:53:07.500]  freedom from insurance while providing compliance with the Obamacare individual mandate.
[02:53:07.500 --> 02:53:13.500]  Imagine having access to quality affordable healthcare that allows you the freedom to choose your doctor and hospital.
[02:53:13.500 --> 02:53:19.500]  Members can share up to 100% of necessary medical expenses including some alternative treatments.
[02:53:19.500 --> 02:53:24.500]  Find out how you and your family can contain healthcare costs without giving up your freedom.
[02:53:24.500 --> 02:53:29.500]  Go to libertyoncall.org. That's libertyoncall.org.
[02:53:54.500 --> 02:53:59.500]  Getting your basic needs to survive. SurvivalistCamps.com
[02:54:25.500 --> 02:54:30.500]  I've got a whole other question pertaining to Hillary.
[02:54:30.500 --> 02:54:36.500]  I mean the establishment tends to just take crises that are already there and exacerbate it and pose the savers and get more power on and on and on.
[02:54:36.500 --> 02:54:40.500]  Never taking responsibility for the terrible job they do and calling themselves geniuses.
[02:54:40.500 --> 02:54:45.500]  So it really adds to the sycophantic culture of nincompoops that we have running things.
[02:54:45.500 --> 02:54:48.500]  I mean we've had a lot more serious hardcore elites before.
[02:54:48.500 --> 02:54:52.500]  So part of the good news is this elite is so out of control they can be defeated.
[02:54:52.500 --> 02:54:56.500]  But they can make big mistakes that cause a nuclear war.
[02:54:56.500 --> 02:55:00.500]  So it's almost the worst scenario in a way.
[02:55:00.500 --> 02:55:04.500]  It's a ticking time bomb.
[02:55:04.500 --> 02:55:09.500]  But did they really ever think Hillary could just get into office even though she was so sick?
[02:55:09.500 --> 02:55:13.500]  That they could cover up the fact that she's collapsing all the time?
[02:55:13.500 --> 02:55:16.500]  I mean I'm talking every hour or more.
[02:55:16.500 --> 02:55:19.500]  Did they really think they could do all this?
[02:55:19.500 --> 02:55:25.500]  And now they think they can send her to a debate and just hope she doesn't fall out during the debate?
[02:55:25.500 --> 02:55:28.500]  Or do they already have some contingency plan for that?
[02:55:28.500 --> 02:55:33.500]  You bet your bottom dollar they do.
[02:55:33.500 --> 02:55:36.500]  But it just goes to the recklessness of these people.
[02:55:36.500 --> 02:55:39.500]  That's what I'm getting at.
[02:55:39.500 --> 02:55:42.500]  Rick in North Carolina, thanks for calling in today. You're on the air.
[02:55:42.500 --> 02:55:46.500]  What do you think is going to happen coming up on November 8th?
[02:55:46.500 --> 02:55:49.500]  Now 47 days up.
[02:55:49.500 --> 02:55:52.500]  Well your guess is as good as mine in between there.
[02:55:52.500 --> 02:55:56.500]  If you just go to YouTube, you can see that she's behind green screens with everything she does.
[02:55:56.500 --> 02:55:59.500]  It's pretty obvious you'd think that was all the money she has.
[02:55:59.500 --> 02:56:01.500]  She'd get someone that knows what they're doing.
[02:56:01.500 --> 02:56:03.500]  By the way, I tend to agree with you.
[02:56:03.500 --> 02:56:06.500]  This is a new thing where she keeps standing with a jet behind her.
[02:56:06.500 --> 02:56:08.500]  It's always the same image, the same airport.
[02:56:08.500 --> 02:56:10.500]  And then she's disappeared.
[02:56:10.500 --> 02:56:12.500]  I don't know what the hell is going on with her.
[02:56:12.500 --> 02:56:15.500]  Hill, this media is so corrupt she could die.
[02:56:15.500 --> 02:56:18.500]  And they could put a body double in office and cover it up.
[02:56:18.500 --> 02:56:21.500]  And then write books about it a decade later saying it was patriotic.
[02:56:21.500 --> 02:56:23.500]  I mean, these people are nuts.
[02:56:23.500 --> 02:56:25.500]  I mean, if they'll lie about everything else, what's to stop them?
[02:56:25.500 --> 02:56:27.500]  That's a great point, Rick.
[02:56:27.500 --> 02:56:30.500]  Well, the more I research, redrudge, and listen to you guys,
[02:56:30.500 --> 02:56:33.500]  it's obvious that there's no end in sight for this rabbit hole.
[02:56:33.500 --> 02:56:36.500]  So I'm kind of, as much as I don't want to think about it,
[02:56:36.500 --> 02:56:39.500]  and I hope that Trump gets in, he gets a breathing room for a little bit.
[02:56:39.500 --> 02:56:41.500]  That would be ideal.
[02:56:41.500 --> 02:56:43.500]  I agree. I call him breathing room. I agree.
[02:56:43.500 --> 02:56:46.500]  Let's get off our back for a minute. Just don't be out to get us.
[02:56:46.500 --> 02:56:48.500]  Okay? Just go ahead.
[02:56:48.500 --> 02:56:52.500]  Before, you know, the internet gets cut off on the first day, you know,
[02:56:52.500 --> 02:56:55.500]  if we can't stop that somehow, you know, what's November 9th going to look like,
[02:56:55.500 --> 02:56:58.500]  you know, before we can, that's the question.
[02:56:58.500 --> 02:57:01.500]  I think, you know, as much as I'm hoping for the best, I think...
[02:57:01.500 --> 02:57:04.500]  Well, let me, let me, let me say this, because I want your view on it,
[02:57:04.500 --> 02:57:06.500]  but it sounds like you're asking a question.
[02:57:06.500 --> 02:57:08.500]  To be clear, the internet's global.
[02:57:08.500 --> 02:57:10.500]  The United States and England built it.
[02:57:10.500 --> 02:57:14.500]  The control of the DNS numbers and the web addresses is being handed to the UN,
[02:57:14.500 --> 02:57:17.500]  show us regulatory control, they admit they want to censor us.
[02:57:17.500 --> 02:57:20.500]  It'll take a month to even phase in the next phase,
[02:57:20.500 --> 02:57:23.500]  but they're already kind of doing it ahead of the handover.
[02:57:23.500 --> 02:57:26.500]  Okay, so I've done shows on that and broken that down, but it will be incremental,
[02:57:26.500 --> 02:57:29.500]  but you won't recognize the internet in a year from now,
[02:57:29.500 --> 02:57:32.500]  if we don't turn this around. It's what we need to President Trump.
[02:57:32.500 --> 02:57:35.500]  He says he'll come in and take back control of the DNS servers.
[02:57:35.500 --> 02:57:38.500]  What do you think is going to happen?
[02:57:38.500 --> 02:57:42.500]  You know, I can't really speak to that.
[02:57:42.500 --> 02:57:46.500]  I just think that she's straight up said that she's going to censor you guys,
[02:57:46.500 --> 02:57:50.500]  Breitbart, all that stuff. I believe it. I have no reason to not believe it.
[02:57:50.500 --> 02:57:53.500]  You know, whether it's going to take a month, two months, a year, not sure.
[02:57:53.500 --> 02:57:56.500]  But it also has to be like whack-a-mole.
[02:57:56.500 --> 02:57:59.500]  If they, if we get into the situation, they're censoring us,
[02:57:59.500 --> 02:58:03.500]  take our articles, our videos, wherever they show up, copy them, spread them even more,
[02:58:03.500 --> 02:58:06.500]  give them names that don't match up with what it is.
[02:58:06.500 --> 02:58:10.500]  You'll find that when they really try to censor, it'll only make us that much hotter.
[02:58:10.500 --> 02:58:15.500]  I'm just curious, if we wake up on the night to Hillary presidency,
[02:58:15.500 --> 02:58:19.500]  you know, I'm kind of curious about what the people in between us and them
[02:58:19.500 --> 02:58:22.500]  are going to do to the military police, to what extent, you know, they're awake.
[02:58:22.500 --> 02:58:25.500]  It'd be nice to maybe have Bongino again.
[02:58:25.500 --> 02:58:29.500]  Well, I mean, sure. I mean, all I can tell you is they've been leaking information
[02:58:29.500 --> 02:58:31.500]  at a level we've never foreseen.
[02:58:31.500 --> 02:58:33.500]  Again, I'm not saying our police and military are perfect,
[02:58:33.500 --> 02:58:36.500]  but they're sure as hell not in Hillary Clinton, and they are freaked out.
[02:58:36.500 --> 02:58:38.500]  And they're asking us, what should we do?
[02:58:38.500 --> 02:58:40.500]  I mean, we're looking at a foreign occupation.
[02:58:40.500 --> 02:58:42.500]  Hillary represents a foreign global takeover.
[02:58:42.500 --> 02:58:46.500]  I mean, that's not rhetoric. She is a foreign multinational agent
[02:58:46.500 --> 02:59:15.500]  of the communist Chinese bare minimum. I mean, this is a takeover.
[02:59:17.500 --> 02:59:23.500]  Including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[02:59:23.500 --> 02:59:29.500]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons, stainless steel construction, easy assembly, low maintenance,
[02:59:29.500 --> 02:59:31.500]  replacement filters are assembled and installed.
[02:59:31.500 --> 02:59:35.500]  And now, as part of an exclusive limited time introductory offer,

[02:59:44.500 --> 02:59:50.500]  Go to infowarstore.com. Recall, 888-253-3139.
[03:00:14.500 --> 03:00:20.500]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:20.500 --> 03:00:24.500]  I.R.S. impeachment hearings, the former head of the I.R.S., the current head.
[03:00:24.500 --> 03:00:26.500]  David Nye's to be covering that coming up.
[03:00:26.500 --> 03:00:29.500]  Also, the race war prep, they're pushing.
[03:00:29.500 --> 03:00:33.500]  In Charlotte and other areas, he's going to be breaking that down.
[03:00:33.500 --> 03:00:37.500]  If I was him, I'd get back into Obama calling for global government yesterday.
[03:00:37.500 --> 03:00:43.500]  I played it the first hour and saying, we have to give up our sovereignty to get with the times.
[03:00:43.500 --> 03:00:46.500]  A boy talked about advertising for a job as the head of the U.N.
[03:00:46.500 --> 03:00:48.500]  So much more.
[03:00:48.500 --> 03:00:50.500]  Nightly news tonight.
[03:00:50.500 --> 03:00:55.500]  7 o'clock central info wars.com forward slash show to find all the details.
[03:00:55.500 --> 03:00:57.500]  The nightly news is subscriber.
[03:00:57.500 --> 03:00:58.500]  People to see it first.
[03:00:58.500 --> 03:01:00.500]  $5.95 a month.
[03:01:00.500 --> 03:01:02.500]  20 people can use the same username and passcode.
[03:01:02.500 --> 03:01:05.500]  So we have our own platform that's harder to censor.
[03:01:05.500 --> 03:01:09.500]  And then the next day, we put up about 90% of the material on YouTube and other platforms.
[03:01:09.500 --> 03:01:13.500]  But the point is, is we have to have our own platform.
[03:01:13.500 --> 03:01:15.500]  And so people that are members are paying it forward.
[03:01:15.500 --> 03:01:16.500]  They are.
[03:01:16.500 --> 03:01:18.500]  People said, why should I pay if it's free?
[03:01:18.500 --> 03:01:19.500]  That's the whole point.
[03:01:19.500 --> 03:01:25.500]  It's an honor to pay to have it in higher quality, first, live, special reports, all my films, so much more.
[03:01:25.500 --> 03:01:28.500]  And then help us put it out for free to wake people up.
[03:01:28.500 --> 03:01:30.500]  It's a war.
[03:01:30.500 --> 03:01:32.500]  I know most of you get that, but some of you don't.
[03:01:32.500 --> 03:01:33.500]  We need your prayers.
[03:01:33.500 --> 03:01:34.500]  We need you to spread the links.
[03:01:34.500 --> 03:01:36.500]  We need you to buy the products.
[03:01:36.500 --> 03:01:42.500]  There are great products to begin with because this is how we build our own economy, the global stone control.

[03:01:54.500 --> 03:01:58.500]  If you'd like to order over the phone or infowarslife.com for the nutraceuticals.
[03:01:58.500 --> 03:02:04.500]  Infowarsstore.com is the umbrella site where you find the thousands of items.
[03:02:04.500 --> 03:02:09.500]  Wow, let's go ahead and talk to Maggie and then Cindy.
[03:02:09.500 --> 03:02:12.500]  Maggie in Georgia, thanks for calling.
[03:02:12.500 --> 03:02:13.500]  Hey, am I on?
[03:02:13.500 --> 03:02:14.500]  Yes, ma'am.
[03:02:14.500 --> 03:02:15.500]  Thanks for holding.
[03:02:15.500 --> 03:02:16.500]  Oh, that's awesome.
[03:02:16.500 --> 03:02:17.500]  What's up, Alex Jones?
[03:02:17.500 --> 03:02:19.500]  Okay, so I was calling about the Hillary thing.
[03:02:19.500 --> 03:02:23.500]  So I think that you know that pneumonia that they made up just for her.
[03:02:23.500 --> 03:02:24.500]  I think it's going to come back.
[03:02:24.500 --> 03:02:28.500]  And this time it'll magically flip slot back to contagious, so she'll have to call in.
[03:02:28.500 --> 03:02:32.500]  Like, if it goes through, if the debate happens, I think that's what's going to happen.
[03:02:32.500 --> 03:02:35.500]  I don't think she'll physically be there.
[03:02:35.500 --> 03:02:38.500]  Well, that's certainly in the cards.
[03:02:38.500 --> 03:02:39.500]  That's the last lie they pulled.
[03:02:39.500 --> 03:02:42.500]  I mean, she's been having these problems for years, clearly not pneumonia.
[03:02:42.500 --> 03:02:46.500]  I just don't see how she can be there when she can't stand up for a 90-minute debate.
[03:02:46.500 --> 03:02:47.500]  What do you think?
[03:02:47.500 --> 03:02:51.500]  See, I would think that the more nervous you are, like, yeah, it would be kind of impossible
[03:02:51.500 --> 03:02:53.500]  to, like, the symptoms would get worse.
[03:02:53.500 --> 03:02:55.500]  I think that's just kind of how it works, isn't it?
[03:02:55.500 --> 03:02:59.500]  I mean, I'm not a neurologist, but I know that stress is associated with, you know,
[03:02:59.500 --> 03:03:03.500]  epileptic or different neurological problems associated with convulsions,
[03:03:03.500 --> 03:03:05.500]  that it's a big contributor, yes.
[03:03:05.500 --> 03:03:08.500]  Yes, but it is very scary, because, I mean, I hope it's something like that
[03:03:08.500 --> 03:03:11.500]  versus something like you're talking about, like, false flag or anything like that,
[03:03:11.500 --> 03:03:15.500]  because, I mean, it is kind of scary, because I don't really, I wouldn't put anything past these people.
[03:03:15.500 --> 03:03:16.500]  Boy, I know this.
[03:03:16.500 --> 03:03:20.500]  47 days out from the election, and all hell's breaking loose worldwide.
[03:03:20.500 --> 03:03:22.500]  And we're all in this together.
[03:03:22.500 --> 03:03:23.500]  Maggie, God bless you.
[03:03:23.500 --> 03:03:24.500]  Take care.
[03:03:24.500 --> 03:03:26.500]  I want to ask every listener to spread the word about the broadcast.
[03:03:26.500 --> 03:03:29.500]  We're ready to be woken up right now, and the censorship's coming in,
[03:03:29.500 --> 03:03:33.500]  and the global government's being announced, and Obama's announcing we got to join the New World Order,
[03:03:33.500 --> 03:03:34.500]  because it's liberal.
[03:03:34.500 --> 03:03:36.500]  He said, quote, liberal New World Order.
[03:03:36.500 --> 03:03:38.500]  People are ready to hear the truth now.
[03:03:38.500 --> 03:03:41.500]  And I want to commend those fighting in the wilderness for decades,
[03:03:41.500 --> 03:03:48.500]  but now is the time to put all sale on, you know, on these masks and go as fast as we can.
[03:03:48.500 --> 03:03:50.500]  Let's talk to Cindy in the PA.
[03:03:50.500 --> 03:03:51.500]  We've got about a minute and a half.
[03:03:51.500 --> 03:03:52.500]  Go ahead.
[03:03:52.500 --> 03:03:54.500]  Yeah, hi, Alex.
[03:03:54.500 --> 03:03:58.500]  I think it's ironic they're having this during a Monday night football game.
[03:03:58.500 --> 03:04:01.500]  Yeah, they hope that would compete with it, but instead it isn't matter.
[03:04:01.500 --> 03:04:03.500]  It's going to hurt the stupid football instead.
[03:04:03.500 --> 03:04:04.500]  Go ahead.
[03:04:04.500 --> 03:04:09.500]  But what if they were to have a false flag event at the football game,
[03:04:09.500 --> 03:04:13.500]  nerve gas, a bomb, like these de-hotties, something go off,
[03:04:13.500 --> 03:04:18.500]  and they have to break away from the debates to go cover the football game?
[03:04:18.500 --> 03:04:19.500]  Yeah, canceling debate.
[03:04:19.500 --> 03:04:20.500]  No, I agree.
[03:04:20.500 --> 03:04:22.500]  That is exactly the type of crap they could pull.
[03:04:22.500 --> 03:04:27.500]  And here's the deal we're about to find out.
[03:04:27.500 --> 03:04:29.500]  Good point, Cindy.
[03:04:29.500 --> 03:04:31.500]  Go ahead.
[03:04:31.500 --> 03:04:32.500]  Good.
[03:04:32.500 --> 03:04:33.500]  One other thing.
[03:04:33.500 --> 03:04:36.500]  I've been a prison planet subscriber for years and years.
[03:04:36.500 --> 03:04:37.500]  Thank you.
[03:04:37.500 --> 03:04:41.500]  And they've been knocking you off streams left and right for the last month.
[03:04:41.500 --> 03:04:43.500]  I used to get you on four streams.
[03:04:43.500 --> 03:04:45.500]  Now I can only get you on pop-up.
[03:04:45.500 --> 03:04:51.500]  They've knocked you out on one, two, three, and four.
[03:04:51.500 --> 03:04:52.500]  Ma'am, we'll investigate that.
[03:04:52.500 --> 03:04:54.500]  Any time there's a problem with it, we'll work on it.
[03:04:54.500 --> 03:04:55.500]  Thank you all for your support.
[03:04:55.500 --> 03:04:56.500]  God bless you.
[03:04:56.500 --> 03:04:57.500]  Sorry I got to cut you short.
[03:04:57.500 --> 03:04:59.500]  David Knight is coming up out of the gate.
[03:04:59.500 --> 03:05:00.500]  Stay with us.
[03:05:00.500 --> 03:05:03.500]  Joe Biggs here with infowars.com.
[03:05:03.500 --> 03:05:07.500]  Join us for our live coverage of the upcoming debate between
[03:05:07.500 --> 03:05:10.500]  Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton on September 26.
[03:05:10.500 --> 03:05:14.500]  Go to infowars.com forward slash show for all the live coverage.
[03:05:14.500 --> 03:05:17.500]  And also go to the Alex Jones channel on YouTube.
[03:05:17.500 --> 03:05:19.500]  Will Hillary wear an earpiece?
[03:05:19.500 --> 03:05:23.500]  Will Donald Trump and Hillary actually be on the same stage?
[03:05:23.500 --> 03:05:26.500]  Or will they try to do another forum like we've seen before?
[03:05:26.500 --> 03:05:31.500]  This is all going to be leading up to our 48-hour long coverage on
[03:05:31.500 --> 03:05:35.500]  November 8 of the election between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump
[03:05:35.500 --> 03:05:37.500]  and the future of America.
[03:05:37.500 --> 03:05:41.500]  Make sure you spread this like wildfire because we need to get patriots
[03:05:41.500 --> 03:05:46.500]  all over the country aligned and ready to stand up and make the changes
[03:05:46.500 --> 03:05:50.500]  we need done by voting and getting someone in who will actually
[03:05:50.500 --> 03:05:54.500]  take America back and make America great again.
[03:05:54.500 --> 03:06:17.500]  This has been Joe Biggs with infowars.com.
[03:06:24.500 --> 03:06:27.500]  All the refugees spreading disease around.
[03:06:27.500 --> 03:06:30.500]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[03:06:30.500 --> 03:06:31.500]  These are all parasites.
[03:06:31.500 --> 03:06:34.500]  Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it.
[03:06:34.500 --> 03:06:35.500]  You have the neem in there.
[03:06:35.500 --> 03:06:38.500]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[03:06:38.500 --> 03:06:41.500]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[03:06:41.500 --> 03:06:42.500]  All right.
[03:06:42.500 --> 03:06:44.500]  Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[03:06:44.500 --> 03:06:45.500]  It just came back in yesterday.

[03:07:30.500 --> 03:07:37.500]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut,
[03:07:37.500 --> 03:07:43.500]  which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[03:07:43.500 --> 03:07:45.500]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[03:07:45.500 --> 03:07:46.500]  This is the real deal, folks.
[03:07:46.500 --> 03:07:51.500]  And the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.

[03:08:21.500 --> 03:08:26.500]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[03:08:26.500 --> 03:08:30.500]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[03:08:30.500 --> 03:08:33.500]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:08:33.500 --> 03:08:35.500]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:35.500 --> 03:08:37.500]  On this Fourth Hour, I'm David Knight.
[03:08:37.500 --> 03:08:41.500]  We're going to continue taking the calls, especially the people who've been hanging on here for a while.
[03:08:41.500 --> 03:08:45.500]  Dave in Pennsylvania, David in Pennsylvania, two different people from Pennsylvania,
[03:08:45.500 --> 03:08:47.500]  and Adam in New York.
[03:08:47.500 --> 03:08:51.500]  Stay with us. I'm going to get to you as soon as I tell people what's coming up this Fourth Hour,
[03:08:51.500 --> 03:08:53.500]  because we have a lot of news.
[03:08:53.500 --> 03:08:59.500]  You will not believe what they have done in New York with the person who's been charged with terrorism.
[03:08:59.500 --> 03:09:00.500]  We're going to talk about that.
[03:09:00.500 --> 03:09:06.500]  We're going to talk about the hearings today on Capitol Hill about impeaching the IRS commissioner.
[03:09:06.500 --> 03:09:09.500]  We're going to also talk about the Syrian bombings.
[03:09:09.500 --> 03:09:13.500]  You've heard a lot about the Syrian bombing of a relief convoy,
[03:09:13.500 --> 03:09:16.500]  but you haven't heard much about what happened over the weekend.
[03:09:16.500 --> 03:09:18.500]  I think that's very, very interesting.
[03:09:18.500 --> 03:09:21.500]  I talked about it Monday night on the Nightly News.
[03:09:21.500 --> 03:09:24.500]  We had a caller talk about it on the Fourth Hour on Monday.
[03:09:24.500 --> 03:09:26.500]  We're going to talk about what happened there.
[03:09:26.500 --> 03:09:27.500]  We're going to talk about the ceasefire.
[03:09:27.500 --> 03:09:34.500]  We're going to talk about Hillary Clinton's campaign having an Aleppo moment, just like Gary Johnson.
[03:09:34.500 --> 03:09:39.500]  When we talk about how weak Hillary is, we got to remember, just as last week,
[03:09:39.500 --> 03:09:42.500]  there were going on and on about Pepe the Frog, the cartoon character.
[03:09:42.500 --> 03:09:47.500]  That was the central focus of the Hillary Clinton campaign because they don't have anything to talk about.
[03:09:47.500 --> 03:09:50.500]  The lady is an obvious liar and a crook.
[03:09:50.500 --> 03:09:53.500]  She has no accomplishments that are positive.
[03:09:53.500 --> 03:09:56.500]  This week, it's all about Skittles.
[03:09:56.500 --> 03:10:01.500]  Now they are attacking Donald Trump Jr. for a tweet that he put out on Skittles.
[03:10:01.500 --> 03:10:07.500]  We're talking about the absolute absurd issues that they're bringing up with the Skittles stuff.
[03:10:07.500 --> 03:10:10.500]  He was fundamentally right, and we're going to tell you why when we get back to that.
[03:10:10.500 --> 03:10:13.500]  But I want to go first to our callers who've been holding for a long time.
[03:10:13.500 --> 03:10:15.500]  Let's go to Adam in New York. Adam?
[03:10:15.500 --> 03:10:17.500]  Hi, David.
[03:10:17.500 --> 03:10:19.500]  Hey, thank you for holding. Go ahead.
[03:10:19.500 --> 03:10:22.500]  I just want to talk really quick about the bits.
[03:10:22.500 --> 03:10:27.500]  I don't think, currently, with everything that's going on, I don't think Hillary is going to make it
[03:10:27.500 --> 03:10:33.500]  unless something happens to where there's something that she can blame on Trump currently with the optics
[03:10:33.500 --> 03:10:35.500]  that she has to use a Roger Stone term.
[03:10:35.500 --> 03:10:41.500]  We're going to talk about optics. I mean, what about her eyes going in different directions?
[03:10:41.500 --> 03:10:44.500]  I mean, you know, people joke about these elitists being lizards or whatever.
[03:10:44.500 --> 03:10:49.500]  I mean, she is turning full-blown Madagascar chameleon, okay, with the eyes moving in different directions.
[03:10:49.500 --> 03:10:53.500]  I tweeted out yesterday, my son actually came up with it.
[03:10:53.500 --> 03:10:58.500]  Lance said that Hillary for prism, and she had those prism glasses.
[03:10:58.500 --> 03:11:00.500]  But anyway, go ahead. I'm sorry.
[03:11:00.500 --> 03:11:03.500]  You don't think she's going to make it to the debates?
[03:11:03.500 --> 03:11:09.500]  The only way she'll be there unless she has something to grill him on, they can turn something.
[03:11:09.500 --> 03:11:14.500]  Like, you've already seen it with the bombings, how, you know, they try to turn it on Trump and try to say,
[03:11:14.500 --> 03:11:19.500]  oh, it's Trump, he's an ISIS recruiter, and they try to blame it.
[03:11:19.500 --> 03:11:22.500]  They'll try to make that Trump-Putin connection.
[03:11:22.500 --> 03:11:24.500]  Trump-Putin.
[03:11:24.500 --> 03:11:31.500]  They've conflated the two of them so much together that they've become one entity in the minds of the Democrats.
[03:11:31.500 --> 03:11:34.500]  Trump-Putin. Just one word there.
[03:11:34.500 --> 03:11:36.500]  Yeah, go ahead.
[03:11:36.500 --> 03:11:41.500]  So, and then if she actually is there, if things go bad, I think previous caller alluded to it.
[03:11:41.500 --> 03:11:48.500]  I think they'll have some sort of false flag, something already in the can, some sort of catastrophe
[03:11:48.500 --> 03:11:52.500]  that they can literally, like, they're cutting to a commercial.
[03:11:52.500 --> 03:11:57.500]  Just bring that up and if things start to look bad for Hillary.
[03:11:57.500 --> 03:12:01.500]  Yeah, I can't see with her wiping her schedule for an entire six days.
[03:12:01.500 --> 03:12:05.500]  Okay, she's cleaned out her schedule to prepare for this debate is what she's saying.
[03:12:05.500 --> 03:12:08.500]  Of course, it's trying to rest up and prepare physically.
[03:12:08.500 --> 03:12:10.500]  I can't see her not showing up.
[03:12:10.500 --> 03:12:15.500]  The only way that I would see this not happening is if they stage some kind of a false flag and say,
[03:12:15.500 --> 03:12:18.500]  well, you know, because of all this, this happened, we can't have the debate.
[03:12:18.500 --> 03:12:20.500]  I think she's going to be under a lot of pressure.
[03:12:20.500 --> 03:12:25.500]  I think it's going to be so damaging to her if she doesn't show up to the debate
[03:12:25.500 --> 03:12:29.500]  that it's going to be a major, major loss for her.
[03:12:29.500 --> 03:12:30.500]  That's the thing.
[03:12:30.500 --> 03:12:34.500]  Donald Trump isn't going to just say, well, gee, I'm really sorry she couldn't show up.
[03:12:34.500 --> 03:12:42.500]  He's going to hammer her with the fact that she's unable to even sit there or stand there for a debate.
[03:12:42.500 --> 03:12:46.500]  I don't really see how she can get away with that.
[03:12:46.500 --> 03:12:47.500]  Just want to add really quick.
[03:12:47.500 --> 03:12:52.500]  I think just about her health, something that not a lot of people have talked about.
[03:12:52.500 --> 03:12:55.500]  I think there's a spiritual component there.
[03:12:55.500 --> 03:12:57.500]  You know, I don't know what it is.
[03:12:57.500 --> 03:13:01.500]  It's almost as if she's kind of sold her soul in the crossroads deal or something.
[03:13:01.500 --> 03:13:06.500]  And now she's kind of paying the price with everything that we see her going through.
[03:13:06.500 --> 03:13:10.500]  She signed that fast in bargain and she didn't look at the expiration date.
[03:13:10.500 --> 03:13:15.500]  She was a little bit expired just a little bit before the election, didn't it?
[03:13:15.500 --> 03:13:17.500]  Yep, her contract's just about up.
[03:13:17.500 --> 03:13:23.500]  Maybe you ought to have Rand Paul look at her and say, yeah, he's an ophthalmologist.
[03:13:23.500 --> 03:13:29.500]  If anybody could fix that problem or take a look at it and say, that's a neurological issue, he could.
[03:13:29.500 --> 03:13:33.500]  And I said, no, her real issue is a character problem.
[03:13:33.500 --> 03:13:35.500]  It's really a soul problem, as you point out.
[03:13:35.500 --> 03:13:36.500]  Thank you, Adam.
[03:13:36.500 --> 03:13:37.500]  Thank you for holding.
[03:13:37.500 --> 03:13:38.500]  Let's go to Dave and Pennsylvania.
[03:13:38.500 --> 03:13:40.500]  Dave, go ahead.
[03:13:40.500 --> 03:13:42.500]  Am I on Dave?
[03:13:42.500 --> 03:13:43.500]  Dave and Pennsylvania.
[03:13:43.500 --> 03:13:46.500]  Yeah, we've got a couple of different days, but this is Dave.
[03:13:46.500 --> 03:13:48.500]  We've got a David, but this is Dave.
[03:13:48.500 --> 03:13:49.500]  I'm Dave.
[03:13:49.500 --> 03:13:51.500]  Okay, go ahead, Dave.
[03:13:51.500 --> 03:13:54.500]  Yeah, here's what I think is going to happen.
[03:13:54.500 --> 03:14:00.500]  I don't think it really matters if she goes or not because I really think they're going to hologram her.
[03:14:00.500 --> 03:14:08.500]  And because they've already back planned everything that they're doing, if you could see that they're letting all the refugees in,
[03:14:08.500 --> 03:14:15.500]  the places that they're placing them around the country pretty much match up with the places that were leveraged
[03:14:15.500 --> 03:14:17.500]  by the money that we got from China.
[03:14:17.500 --> 03:14:19.500]  And what I think they're going to do is,
[03:14:19.500 --> 03:14:23.500]  they already said North Korea got backpack nukes.
[03:14:23.500 --> 03:14:26.500]  Why wouldn't they go ahead and blow that up?
[03:14:26.500 --> 03:14:29.500]  They leveraged the money already.
[03:14:29.500 --> 03:14:34.500]  Well, I wouldn't be surprised if there's a false flag, but I don't think they're going to get away with something like a hologram.
[03:14:34.500 --> 03:14:37.500]  Clearly, Donald Trump would have something to say about that.
[03:14:37.500 --> 03:14:41.500]  It's like, Hillary, you are the most transparent I have ever seen you.
[03:14:41.500 --> 03:14:43.500]  She's not been transparent.
[03:14:43.500 --> 03:14:51.500]  Actually, she is. She is, perhaps, she and Obama are the most transparently criminal people we have ever had in government.
[03:14:51.500 --> 03:14:53.500]  Most transparent liars we've ever had.
[03:14:53.500 --> 03:14:54.500]  Thank you so much, Dave.
[03:14:54.500 --> 03:14:56.500]  Let's go to David and Pennsylvania.
[03:14:56.500 --> 03:14:57.500]  Go ahead, David.
[03:14:57.500 --> 03:15:00.500]  You're doing a fine job there today.
[03:15:00.500 --> 03:15:06.500]  I was going to tell you, did you know that Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton's families are originally from the Scranton-Pennsylvania area?
[03:15:06.500 --> 03:15:09.500]  I knew that about Biden, yeah.
[03:15:09.500 --> 03:15:16.500]  Well, Hillary Clinton is for up in that area, too, and I got an idea that after Trump landslides her in the November election,
[03:15:16.500 --> 03:15:19.500]  she then next year could run for the mayor of the city of Scranton.
[03:15:19.500 --> 03:15:20.500]  There you go.
[03:15:20.500 --> 03:15:25.500]  Do you think she could get elected dog catcher in Pennsylvania after shutting down all the coal mines?
[03:15:25.500 --> 03:15:26.500]  In town.
[03:15:26.500 --> 03:15:30.500]  And the reason why they call it steam cars is because the politicians up there are full of hot air.
[03:15:30.500 --> 03:15:32.500]  Yeah, that's good.
[03:15:32.500 --> 03:15:33.500]  That's good.
[03:15:33.500 --> 03:15:35.500]  Yeah, I don't know if she could get elected dog catcher.
[03:15:35.500 --> 03:15:40.500]  If they come in and the two of them say we're going to completely shut down entire industries,
[03:15:40.500 --> 03:15:43.500]  they have absolute contempt for the American people.
[03:15:43.500 --> 03:15:47.500]  They not only want to replace our industries, they want to replace the American people.
[03:15:47.500 --> 03:15:53.500]  People in Germany have called it what it is, the great people replacement.
[03:15:53.500 --> 03:15:54.500]  We've seen this happen.
[03:15:54.500 --> 03:16:01.500]  As a matter of fact, in Germany, they referred to a famous or the First Amendment either.
[03:16:01.500 --> 03:16:02.500]  Same thing with the Second Amendment.
[03:16:02.500 --> 03:16:05.500]  They're very selective, aren't they, about what they want to talk about?
[03:16:05.500 --> 03:16:06.500]  Stay with us.
[03:16:06.500 --> 03:16:07.500]  We'll go right back to the callers when we come back from break.
[03:16:07.500 --> 03:16:36.500]  We'll be right back.
[03:16:37.500 --> 03:17:06.500]  We'll be right back.
[03:17:07.500 --> 03:17:33.500]  We'll be right back.
[03:17:33.500 --> 03:17:59.500]  We'll be right back.
[03:17:59.500 --> 03:18:25.500]  We'll be right back.
[03:18:25.500 --> 03:18:38.500]  We'll be right back.
[03:18:38.500 --> 03:18:44.500]  Rubbing out every expression of religion, every exercise of religion anywhere in the country.
[03:18:44.500 --> 03:18:55.500]  They even have a society for it's against the freedom of religion.
[03:18:55.500 --> 03:18:57.500]  It's the expression of religion that is protected in the First Amendment.
[03:18:57.500 --> 03:19:04.500]  We specifically wanted a government that would not attack people on the basis of what religion they were.
[03:19:04.500 --> 03:19:07.500]  And yet the Muslims want exactly the opposite.
[03:19:07.500 --> 03:19:13.500]  You can see what happens in our close ally, Saudi Arabia, the people that Hillary goes to for money.
[03:19:13.500 --> 03:19:18.500]  The schools that she goes to to tell them, hey, not everybody in America wears a bikini.
[03:19:18.500 --> 03:19:20.500]  We understand what you guys are about.
[03:19:20.500 --> 03:19:23.500]  Solisting money, soliciting support from these people.
[03:19:23.500 --> 03:19:25.500]  We know what Sharia is about.
[03:19:25.500 --> 03:19:33.500]  We know that Khan, Sharia Khan I call him, the man that she had speak before she took the nomination.
[03:19:33.500 --> 03:19:36.500]  We know that he is promoting Sharia law.
[03:19:36.500 --> 03:19:40.500]  It is antithetical to everything this country stands for.
[03:19:40.500 --> 03:19:43.500]  They are trying to set up a theocracy with their religion.
[03:19:43.500 --> 03:19:46.500]  And so when people come here and they want to overthrow your legal structure,
[03:19:46.500 --> 03:19:51.500]  when they want to overthrow the Bill of Rights, why do we allow that?
[03:19:51.500 --> 03:20:11.500]  It's an invasion. Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[03:20:52.500 --> 03:20:53.500]  Don't wait for the government.
[03:20:53.500 --> 03:20:59.500]  Go to PortableSolarLLC.com to learn why Solarc is energy insurance for your family.
[03:20:59.500 --> 03:21:01.500]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[03:24:16.500 --> 03:24:18.500]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight.
[03:24:18.500 --> 03:24:22.500]  We're going to cover some information about the IRS impeachment hearings.
[03:24:22.500 --> 03:24:26.500]  It's absolutely amazing when you stop and think about the fact that Nixon was impeached.
[03:24:26.500 --> 03:24:32.500]  But now we can't even impeach the minions who are doing what he attempted to do
[03:24:32.500 --> 03:24:35.500]  and didn't even get started doing.
[03:24:35.500 --> 03:24:38.500]  We had an IRS commissioner at that time that shut it down.
[03:24:38.500 --> 03:24:40.500]  But before I get to the news on that, I don't want to get too deep in that
[03:24:40.500 --> 03:24:43.500]  before I let you know that we've got a couple of sales that we have extended
[03:24:43.500 --> 03:24:46.500]  as well as our new free app.
[03:24:46.500 --> 03:24:48.500]  Let me tell you about the free app first.
[03:24:48.500 --> 03:24:50.500]  Last night when I looked on the Apple store,
[03:24:50.500 --> 03:24:57.500]  I saw that we were trending as number five in the top 10 searches on the Apple store.
[03:24:57.500 --> 03:24:59.500]  Infowars was number five.
[03:24:59.500 --> 03:25:02.500]  That was about 8 p.m. Central Time last night.
[03:25:02.500 --> 03:25:07.500]  It's a great app. If you haven't seen it, it does everything that our previous free app did,
[03:25:07.500 --> 03:25:13.500]  which was basically just that app actually just plays the radio program predominantly.
[03:25:13.500 --> 03:25:15.500]  This will go through and show you articles.
[03:25:15.500 --> 03:25:17.500]  It'll show you special reports.
[03:25:17.500 --> 03:25:21.500]  You can choose between a video and an audio feed of the show.
[03:25:21.500 --> 03:25:23.500]  So it's a great app. Take a look at it.
[03:25:23.500 --> 03:25:28.500]  You can find it at the Apple store at the Android Play store, and it is free.
[03:25:28.500 --> 03:25:31.500]  Now, if you want to support our operation, you want to support your health.
[03:25:31.500 --> 03:25:37.500]  At the same time, we have offered you some sales that are going to be expiring pretty soon,
[03:25:37.500 --> 03:25:40.500]  but we have now extended them for just a little while longer.
[03:25:40.500 --> 03:25:44.500]  Another 24 hours by listener request for Supermail Vitality,
[03:25:44.500 --> 03:25:47.500]  20% off at InfowarsLife.com.
[03:25:47.500 --> 03:25:52.500]  Also, our ultra-powerful Secret 12 formula, that's our B12 formulation,
[03:25:52.500 --> 03:25:58.500]  is now 20% off as well at InfowarsLife.com, and that is for a limited time only.
[03:25:58.500 --> 03:26:01.500]  Take a look at those. Look at the other products that are there.
[03:26:01.500 --> 03:26:04.500]  There are hundreds of reviews for each of these products.
[03:26:04.500 --> 03:26:06.500]  People who have bought them and used them.
[03:26:06.500 --> 03:26:09.500]  See what other people say about this. Do your own investigation.
[03:26:09.500 --> 03:26:12.500]  Things like vitamin B12 are very important for your health,
[03:26:12.500 --> 03:26:15.500]  and you can also see what is in Supermail Vitality.
[03:26:15.500 --> 03:26:16.500]  See what other people have said.
[03:26:16.500 --> 03:26:22.500]  Of course, Tim Kennedy has talked about how that has been a game-changer for him in his training
[03:26:22.500 --> 03:26:29.500]  as he's coming up to the Mixed Martial Arts fight for, I think it's,
[03:26:29.500 --> 03:26:33.500]  I'm not sure what weight class it's in, but it's a championship fight, I believe,
[03:26:33.500 --> 03:26:36.500]  in Madison Square Gardens. He's a very serious trainer,
[03:26:36.500 --> 03:26:39.500]  and he said it made a huge difference in his training.
[03:26:39.500 --> 03:26:45.500]  Again, 20% off that and 20% off Super12, our vitamin B12 formulation.
[03:26:45.500 --> 03:26:48.500]  Let's talk about the situation today, the hearings,
[03:26:48.500 --> 03:26:51.500]  about whether or not the IRS chief should be impeached.
[03:26:51.500 --> 03:26:56.500]  Now, the Hill says conservatives who back impeachment for the IRS commissioner,
[03:26:56.500 --> 03:27:00.500]  Koskinen, say that he hindered congressional investigations into whether the IRS
[03:27:00.500 --> 03:27:05.500]  unfairly scrutinized applications from conservative groups for tax-exempt status.
[03:27:05.500 --> 03:27:13.500]  Remember, Nixon was impeached because he tried to use the IRS to go after political enemies.
[03:27:13.500 --> 03:27:18.500]  Obama was not impeached when he used the IRS to go after a massive number
[03:27:18.500 --> 03:27:22.500]  of what he considered to be political enemies, the Tea Party.
[03:27:22.500 --> 03:27:25.500]  Now, they, in his defense, they say, well,
[03:27:25.500 --> 03:27:29.500]  Koskinen took the reins of the IRS several months after the 2013 controversy,
[03:27:29.500 --> 03:27:33.500]  but he blocked the investigation. That's the point.
[03:27:33.500 --> 03:27:37.500]  The previous IRS commissioner under Nixon turned Nixon in,
[03:27:37.500 --> 03:27:40.500]  and Nixon was impeached. That's the way it should be done.
[03:27:40.500 --> 03:27:44.500]  But now we have a government that is rotted from the head down.
[03:27:44.500 --> 03:27:50.500]  You've got an executive who rules like a third world dictator
[03:27:50.500 --> 03:27:53.500]  using the IRS against his political enemies,
[03:27:53.500 --> 03:27:56.500]  and everybody from Obama down to the IRS commissioner,
[03:27:56.500 --> 03:28:01.500]  down to the people who erased the tapes at the IRS,
[03:28:01.500 --> 03:28:03.500]  they all seem to get a pass.
[03:28:03.500 --> 03:28:05.500]  Now, there's another article on the Hill, a Republican.
[03:28:05.500 --> 03:28:10.500]  Jim Jordan, who is the House Freedom Caucus Chairman,
[03:28:10.500 --> 03:28:14.500]  is pushing for this hearing. He said today that impeaching the IRS commissioner
[03:28:14.500 --> 03:28:17.500]  is the least that Congress can do. He says,
[03:28:17.500 --> 03:28:21.500]  all we're asking is that this guy no longer hold this office.
[03:28:21.500 --> 03:28:25.500]  And in light of the pattern of facts, I think that is the least we can do.
[03:28:25.500 --> 03:28:27.500]  Absolutely, it's the least they can do.
[03:28:27.500 --> 03:28:31.500]  But of course, you have these people in these bureaucracies
[03:28:31.500 --> 03:28:33.500]  that are permanently entrenched.
[03:28:33.500 --> 03:28:38.500]  We can never reduce the size of these regulatory agencies.
[03:28:38.500 --> 03:28:42.500]  The IRS was, I think, really the first example of what we've seen now,
[03:28:42.500 --> 03:28:46.500]  this pattern of tyranny that has multiplied every agency.
[03:28:46.500 --> 03:28:49.500]  Just like the IRS essentially wrote the rules,
[03:28:49.500 --> 03:28:53.500]  Congress said we're going to create a taxing agency,
[03:28:53.500 --> 03:28:55.500]  we're going to have an income tax here,
[03:28:55.500 --> 03:28:58.500]  and we're going to let you write and enforce the rules as you see fit.
[03:28:58.500 --> 03:29:00.500]  Now we have the EPA doing it,
[03:29:00.500 --> 03:29:03.500]  we have all these different regulatory agencies doing it.
[03:29:03.500 --> 03:29:05.500]  They are writing the law.
[03:29:05.500 --> 03:29:09.500]  There's no longer legislation being done by our elected representatives.
[03:29:09.500 --> 03:29:14.500]  For the most part, they're just raising money for their next election
[03:29:14.500 --> 03:29:17.500]  from people that they're going to do political favors for.
[03:29:17.500 --> 03:29:19.500]  That's how corrupt Washington is.
[03:29:19.500 --> 03:29:22.500]  It's become this Byzantine corrupt empire that's there.
[03:29:22.500 --> 03:29:24.500]  But these people are there forever.
[03:29:24.500 --> 03:29:26.500]  They are the legislators.
[03:29:26.500 --> 03:29:31.500]  Legislation without representation and taxation without representation.
[03:29:31.500 --> 03:29:33.500]  They decide how they're going to find us.
[03:29:33.500 --> 03:29:35.500]  They come up with excessive fines.
[03:29:35.500 --> 03:29:37.500]  They say these are civil penalties,
[03:29:37.500 --> 03:29:40.500]  so you don't have any protection against excessive fines,
[03:29:40.500 --> 03:29:44.500]  and you don't have the assumption of innocence before being found guilty.
[03:29:44.500 --> 03:29:46.500]  And of course, when we look at what the IRS did,
[03:29:46.500 --> 03:29:48.500]  destroying evidence said we don't have it.
[03:29:48.500 --> 03:29:51.500]  You would be in jail just like the people who violate national security
[03:29:51.500 --> 03:29:53.500]  would be in jail if they did what Hillary Clinton did with the emails.
[03:29:53.500 --> 03:29:56.500]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:24.500 --> 03:30:28.500]  We know the Saudis hit Yemeni hospitals, schools, and other civilian targets.
[03:30:28.500 --> 03:30:32.500]  Senator Rand Paul from Kentucky said he pushed to end the U.S. assistance
[03:30:32.500 --> 03:30:34.500]  to Saudi Arabia in the war in Yemen.
[03:30:34.500 --> 03:30:37.500]  Paul says, quote, this is part of a larger effort by many of us
[03:30:37.500 --> 03:30:39.500]  to say that Congress is not only...
[03:30:39.500 --> 03:30:42.500]  This isn't even something that was important that happened in the past,
[03:30:42.500 --> 03:30:44.500]  like the JFK assassination.
[03:30:44.500 --> 03:30:46.500]  This is what's happening now.
[03:30:46.500 --> 03:30:48.500]  This is our life now.
[03:30:48.500 --> 03:30:50.500]  You need to understand what is going on now.
[03:30:50.500 --> 03:30:53.500]  This is the problem that I have with people like Gary Johnson.
[03:30:53.500 --> 03:30:57.500]  They don't understand the context of the events that are happening right now.
[03:30:57.500 --> 03:30:59.500]  They don't even know what is Aleppo.
[03:30:59.500 --> 03:31:21.500]  He doesn't understand the context, the players, what's happening there.
[03:31:29.500 --> 03:31:33.500]  It's an easy way to naturally upgrade your vitamin B12 intake
[03:31:33.500 --> 03:31:35.500]  and support your body's natural systems.
[03:31:35.500 --> 03:31:40.500]  It pairs two forms of vitamin B12 into one explosive formula.
[03:31:40.500 --> 03:31:44.500]  Vitamin B12 supports healthy energy levels through red blood cell formation
[03:31:44.500 --> 03:31:46.500]  and aiding in the body's natural processes,
[03:31:46.500 --> 03:31:49.500]  but it also assists with many other functions of the body.
[03:31:49.500 --> 03:31:52.500]  Electrify your mind and body and take your health to the next level.

[03:31:56.500 --> 03:31:59.500]  That's InfowarsLife.com.
[03:32:26.500 --> 03:32:34.500]  It was. He was actually the owner of Tactical Advantage LCC, or LLC.
[03:32:34.500 --> 03:32:39.500]  He teaches people in concealed carry classes.
[03:32:39.500 --> 03:32:47.500]  He's also a competitor in the USPSA, which is a competitive three-gun sporting event.
[03:32:47.500 --> 03:32:49.500]  Wow, wow.
[03:32:49.500 --> 03:32:52.500]  That's a real blessing that that guy was there, and we need more people like that.
[03:32:52.500 --> 03:32:56.500]  What he's doing is training people to take responsibility to protect themselves
[03:32:56.500 --> 03:32:59.500]  and protect other people as well. That's very important.
[03:32:59.500 --> 03:33:01.500]  Yeah.
[03:33:01.500 --> 03:33:03.500]  Well, I just know a lot of people didn't know that.
[03:33:03.500 --> 03:33:06.500]  Yeah, yeah, that's very important. Thank you for pointing that out again.
[03:33:06.500 --> 03:33:09.500]  You know, we talk about one of the articles that I've got here
[03:33:09.500 --> 03:33:14.500]  about the number of people coming in, almost 100,000 Somali refugees admitted to the US since 9-11.
[03:33:14.500 --> 03:33:21.500]  99.6% of them are Muslim, and of course the guy who did the stabbing is a Somali who came in.
[03:33:21.500 --> 03:33:23.500]  But it's his father who came in.
[03:33:23.500 --> 03:33:27.500]  And I think it's interesting that it's always, it's the second generation.
[03:33:27.500 --> 03:33:31.500]  We talk about not being able to vet the people coming in, and the fact that Germany is admitting,
[03:33:31.500 --> 03:33:36.500]  okay, probably at least the tenth of a percent of the people coming in are already jihadis.
[03:33:36.500 --> 03:33:42.500]  But in most of these cases, the people who are doing this are the second generation people.
[03:33:42.500 --> 03:33:46.500]  Their parents do not want to assimilate.
[03:33:46.500 --> 03:33:50.500]  They self-ghetto-ize, and the second generation gets very angry.
[03:33:50.500 --> 03:33:55.500]  Teens are charged with terroristic threats after creepy clown abduction posts on Facebook.
[03:33:55.500 --> 03:33:57.500]  This is a story from RT.
[03:33:57.500 --> 03:34:03.500]  They say 14-agers in Georgia have been charged with making quote-unquote terroristic threats
[03:34:03.500 --> 03:34:09.500]  after allegedly posting Facebook messages threatening to abduct children while dressed as clowns.
[03:34:09.500 --> 03:34:12.500]  They say this is in the wake of a craze of creepy clown sightings.
[03:34:12.500 --> 03:34:19.500]  It's prompted police to establish if any real threat exists among the hoaxes, okay?
[03:34:19.500 --> 03:34:26.500]  Now, this is very likely some immature teenagers who think it's really funny to dress up like clowns and scare people.
[03:34:26.500 --> 03:34:28.500]  This has been going around for quite a while.
[03:34:28.500 --> 03:34:31.500]  They make some statements on Facebook.
[03:34:31.500 --> 03:34:36.500]  I don't know if they were serious or not, but if they were, it is not terrorism.
[03:34:36.500 --> 03:34:38.500]  First of all, they didn't do anything to anybody.
[03:34:38.500 --> 03:34:43.500]  This is some postings on Facebook, but they were charged now, rested with terrorism.
[03:34:43.500 --> 03:34:51.500]  Two 18-year-olds from Georgia, a 17-year-old from Alabama, arrested for terroristic threats.
[03:34:51.500 --> 03:34:53.500]  Now, hold that in your mind.
[03:34:53.500 --> 03:34:55.500]  Oh, also a 16-year-old as well, okay?
[03:34:55.500 --> 03:34:57.500]  Arrested for terroristic threats.
[03:34:57.500 --> 03:35:02.500]  Two 18s, one 17-year-old and a 16-year-old arrested for terrorism because they get on Facebook
[03:35:02.500 --> 03:35:06.500]  and talk about how they're going to abduct people dressed as clowns.
[03:35:06.500 --> 03:35:07.500]  Probably a joke.
[03:35:07.500 --> 03:35:12.500]  Meanwhile, here's the joke that the government plays on us.
[03:35:12.500 --> 03:35:19.500]  The guy who really is a terrorist in New York, who really did put bombs out and blew one up, okay,
[03:35:19.500 --> 03:35:21.500]  is not charged with terrorism.
[03:35:21.500 --> 03:35:22.500]  Not charged with terrorism.
[03:35:22.500 --> 03:35:24.500]  They charged him with bombing today.
[03:35:24.500 --> 03:35:26.500]  They charged him with property destruction.
[03:35:26.500 --> 03:35:35.500]  He blew up a dumpster and the use of weapons of mass destruction, but not with terrorism
[03:35:35.500 --> 03:35:39.500]  or material support as was expected, you see?
[03:35:39.500 --> 03:35:42.500]  The FBI can't even say Islamic terrorism.
[03:35:42.500 --> 03:35:48.500]  Forget about the fact that Obama and Hillary can't put those two words together, Islamic terrorism.
[03:35:48.500 --> 03:35:50.500]  The FBI won't even do it.
[03:35:50.500 --> 03:35:55.500]  And it's amazing because this is precisely what we saw Comey did with Hillary Clinton.
[03:35:55.500 --> 03:35:59.500]  Lays out the felonies that she committed, the multiple felonies that she committed,
[03:35:59.500 --> 03:36:02.500]  and then comes out and says, but it'd be crazy to charge her that way.
[03:36:02.500 --> 03:36:08.500]  So I guess you got somebody that plants bombs around the city and explodes one of them.
[03:36:08.500 --> 03:36:16.500]  Then it would be crazy to charge him with terrorism, especially when he considers himself to be an Islamic terrorist.
[03:36:16.500 --> 03:36:20.500]  They point out, even in the Guardian, they say the charges that were filed in federal court
[03:36:20.500 --> 03:36:25.500]  suggest the investigators were unable to connect Rahami to a terrorist group,
[03:36:25.500 --> 03:36:33.500]  though the documents quote a journal on his person referring to Jihad and two prominent Jihadi figures.
[03:36:33.500 --> 03:36:36.500]  He was an Islamic terrorist, folks.
[03:36:36.500 --> 03:36:37.500]  They know it.
[03:36:37.500 --> 03:36:44.500]  They find, he's got literally a smoking bomb and the journal that talks about Jihad,
[03:36:44.500 --> 03:36:47.500]  but they won't call it terrorism.
[03:36:47.500 --> 03:36:52.500]  And I think this is interesting because, again, this is the wiggle room that we saw with Comey
[03:36:52.500 --> 03:36:54.500]  in terms of letting Hillary Clinton off.
[03:36:54.500 --> 03:36:58.500]  And Comey, as I've pointed out before, has a very, very long history,
[03:36:58.500 --> 03:37:02.500]  just as Loretta Lynch does with the Clinton crime family.
[03:37:02.500 --> 03:37:04.500]  They let Sandy Berger off.
[03:37:04.500 --> 03:37:08.500]  Two of them were looking at Sandy Berger when he went into the National Archives
[03:37:08.500 --> 03:37:13.500]  as the 9-11 Commission was looking into what the Clintons knew about terrorism
[03:37:13.500 --> 03:37:15.500]  in the wake of the 9-11 investigation.
[03:37:15.500 --> 03:37:16.500]  There was some stuff there.
[03:37:16.500 --> 03:37:17.500]  We don't know what it was.
[03:37:17.500 --> 03:37:18.500]  They didn't want anybody to see it.
[03:37:18.500 --> 03:37:22.500]  So they sent in Sandy Berger, who had been part of their national security team.
[03:37:22.500 --> 03:37:23.500]  I think he was ahead of it.
[03:37:23.500 --> 03:37:27.500]  He goes in and gets the documents, stuffs them in his clothes, walks out,
[03:37:27.500 --> 03:37:30.500]  and then destroys those documents, and nothing happened to him.
[03:37:30.500 --> 03:37:34.500]  And the people who were running the prosecution on that one were the same people
[03:37:34.500 --> 03:37:38.500]  that didn't run the prosecution on Hillary Clinton either.
[03:37:38.500 --> 03:37:44.500]  And so when we look at this, I'm just absolutely stunned to see this.
[03:37:44.500 --> 03:37:48.500]  And yet they say, like he gave her the wiggle room to say,
[03:37:48.500 --> 03:37:52.500]  well, there wasn't any intention of criminal action on Hillary's part
[03:37:52.500 --> 03:37:56.500]  when they deliberately erased all these emails, as we see now,
[03:37:56.500 --> 03:38:01.500]  with the information coming out of Reddit, with her IT guy who continually took
[03:38:01.500 --> 03:38:07.500]  the Fifth Amendment, but he was on Reddit asking people for help
[03:38:07.500 --> 03:38:14.500]  in terms of erasing traces of anything that he had done for a VIP person.
[03:38:14.500 --> 03:38:17.500]  And as we know that they used a bleach bit,
[03:38:17.500 --> 03:38:24.500]  which is not just erasing the information, but completely eradicating any chance of recovery.
[03:38:24.500 --> 03:38:27.500]  It's a hard core cover up.
[03:38:27.500 --> 03:38:30.500]  Kind of like taking a hammer and smashing your device, that type of stuff,
[03:38:30.500 --> 03:38:32.500]  which we also found out about them.
[03:38:32.500 --> 03:38:36.500]  But in the same way that the FBI covered for Hillary Clinton and said,
[03:38:36.500 --> 03:38:41.500]  well, there wasn't any intention in this when there really was, and we know that now,
[03:38:41.500 --> 03:38:45.500]  they come in and say, well, he wasn't connected to a terrorist group.
[03:38:45.500 --> 03:38:49.500]  These are the people who tell us after every single terrorist attack
[03:38:49.500 --> 03:38:51.500]  that it was a lone wolf terrorist.
[03:38:51.500 --> 03:38:55.500]  And yet, this guy is not going to be charged with terrorism because he wasn't connected to a group.
[03:38:55.500 --> 03:38:58.500]  Really? Really? Serious?
[03:38:58.500 --> 03:39:01.500]  He thinks he's part of a group? He thinks he's part of ISIS?
[03:39:01.500 --> 03:39:04.500]  ISIS thinks he's part of ISIS? We think he's.
[03:39:04.500 --> 03:39:06.500]  I don't know. Maybe, you know, it is suspicious.
[03:39:06.500 --> 03:39:11.500]  Even the Guardian says, why would he put the bomb in a dumpster?
[03:39:11.500 --> 03:39:13.500]  That's something to think about.
[03:39:13.500 --> 03:39:18.500]  Because at the time these bombings were going off, folks, just before it happened.
[03:39:18.500 --> 03:39:22.500]  We had a massive bombing that was being done by Obama, and I talked about this Monday night.
[03:39:22.500 --> 03:39:25.500]  I talked about it in depth, and I'm not going to go into that much detail.
[03:39:25.500 --> 03:39:29.500]  I said, Obama, the mad bomber of Syria.
[03:39:29.500 --> 03:39:34.500]  We had an article on Monday from Syrian girl how the U.S. became ISIS's Air Force.
[03:39:34.500 --> 03:39:39.500]  Remember, we had people saying back in 2013, look, we don't want to get involved in the Syrian war.
[03:39:39.500 --> 03:39:44.500]  We don't want to be al-Qaeda's Air Force, which is what they all knew the U.S. government wanted to do.
[03:39:44.500 --> 03:39:47.500]  Well, that's exactly what we did this last weekend.
[03:39:47.500 --> 03:39:55.500]  There was a military base in Syria that was protecting a city that was there.
[03:39:55.500 --> 03:39:58.500]  And they had amassed a lot of troops.
[03:39:58.500 --> 03:40:04.500]  They had amassed 1,000 elite Syrian commandos at this long-term military Syrian army military base.
[03:40:04.500 --> 03:40:07.500]  It had been a military base for the Syrian army for a long time.
[03:40:07.500 --> 03:40:14.500]  As they amassed 1,000 elite Syrian commandos there, the U.S. Air Force began striking that base
[03:40:14.500 --> 03:40:19.500]  and killed 80 Syrian soldiers wounded 100.
[03:40:19.500 --> 03:40:24.500]  That's what the Romans would call decimation, killing one out of 10.
[03:40:24.500 --> 03:40:30.500]  Okay, which they, I guess if you look at the total casualties there, dead and wounded,
[03:40:30.500 --> 03:40:34.500]  it's even, it's almost 20% that they got out of that force.
[03:40:34.500 --> 03:40:40.500]  So what has happened now, ISIS has now taken control of that base because we operated and did that for them.
[03:40:40.500 --> 03:40:45.500]  And that attack went on for 20 minutes until Russia contacted the U.N. as well as the U.S.
[03:40:45.500 --> 03:40:49.500]  and said, hey, you violated the ceasefire, you need to stop this.
[03:40:49.500 --> 03:40:57.500]  Now that city that the army base was protecting, a city of 200,000, is now under threat of an ISIS invasion.
[03:40:57.500 --> 03:40:59.500]  That happened over the weekend. You didn't hear anything about that, did you?
[03:40:59.500 --> 03:41:07.500]  That happened a little bit before these bombings in New York where the bomb was put inside a dumpster.
[03:41:07.500 --> 03:41:18.500]  But to follow up on that, we had a U.S. coalition that was delivering aid to Syrian refugees inside Syria that was attacked.
[03:41:18.500 --> 03:41:24.500]  Now they say that there was no air force in the area except for Russian and Syrian planes.
[03:41:24.500 --> 03:41:33.500]  Russia has come back and said, and this is from Reuters, Russia says U.S. drone was in an area where a U.N. convoy was struck in Syria.
[03:41:33.500 --> 03:41:36.500]  So they say, yeah, it wasn't a plane, it was a drone attack.
[03:41:36.500 --> 03:41:43.500]  The Russian spokesman said that Western allegations that Moscow was responsible were an attempt to distract attention
[03:41:43.500 --> 03:41:50.500]  from the U.S.-led coalition's bombing of Syrian soldiers that I just told you about Saturday in Syria.
[03:41:50.500 --> 03:41:52.500]  And they were very specific about it.
[03:41:52.500 --> 03:41:57.500]  They said on the evening of September 19th in that specific region, a drone belonging to the International Coalition
[03:41:57.500 --> 03:42:07.500]  had taken off from the Ingerlich airbase and Turkey was flying at a height of 3,600 meters and traveling about 200 kilometers per hour.
[03:42:07.500 --> 03:42:11.500]  So the Russians are saying that it wasn't our planes, it was a drone attack.
[03:42:11.500 --> 03:42:14.500]  Nevertheless, this is what is going on in Syria.
[03:42:14.500 --> 03:42:21.500]  When we talk about the humanitarian crisis, you have to understand that in the past we have always given aid.
[03:42:21.500 --> 03:42:24.500]  The United States has given more aid than anybody else.
[03:42:24.500 --> 03:42:29.500]  They can more refugees than anybody else has in this particular situation as well.
[03:42:29.500 --> 03:42:36.500]  Unfortunately, most of the time when we give aid, it gets stolen by the kleptocrats that run the country.
[03:42:36.500 --> 03:42:40.500]  But we can still, if we are careful, we can still aid people in that country.
[03:42:40.500 --> 03:42:46.500]  In this particular case, this case is different from many of the refugee cases that we've seen
[03:42:46.500 --> 03:42:55.500]  in the sense that we are the ones who started this war and who continue this war, as we just saw this last weekend,
[03:42:55.500 --> 03:42:58.500]  being the Air Force for al-Qaeda.
[03:42:58.500 --> 03:43:07.500]  Now, this ceasefire apparently has fallen to pieces and they're going to use that as an excuse to bring more people into this country
[03:43:07.500 --> 03:43:10.500]  from Syria and from other Islamic countries.
[03:43:10.500 --> 03:43:20.500]  People who have seen their country destroyed by what they believe are American bombs, American drones, and case after case.
[03:43:20.500 --> 03:43:26.500]  And I want to look at what happened on Morning Joe with Hillary's campaign manager.
[03:43:26.500 --> 03:43:33.500]  This is Robby Mook and he goes on to the Morning Joe show, Joe Scarborough,
[03:43:33.500 --> 03:43:41.500]  and they ask, what is the plan to deal with ISIS? And she doesn't have a plan.
[03:43:41.500 --> 03:43:45.500]  Because again, they started this, they started it going all the way back to Libya,
[03:43:45.500 --> 03:43:52.500]  but we've seen time and again the U.S. training, transporting troops there, training the troops, equipping the troops,
[03:43:52.500 --> 03:43:56.500]  and now acting as their Air Force, they want to keep this going.
[03:43:56.500 --> 03:44:02.500]  They want the chaos because that is the excuse for the Islamification of the U.S.
[03:44:02.500 --> 03:44:09.500]  Now, Mook says, well, in contrast to Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, this is Hillary Clinton's campaign manager on the show,
[03:44:09.500 --> 03:44:15.500]  has released a clear and decisive plan to defeat ISIS, and they called his bluff on it.
[03:44:15.500 --> 03:44:19.500]  They pressed him further for specifics about Clinton's thoughts on Syria,
[03:44:19.500 --> 03:44:24.500]  and he repeatedly dodged and referred questions to Clinton herself.
[03:44:24.500 --> 03:44:27.500]  He says, again, I think you're going to have to ask her that question.
[03:44:27.500 --> 03:44:33.500]  If she had a clear and decisive plan, don't you think that her campaign manager would be able to explain that?
[03:44:33.500 --> 03:44:39.500]  If somebody asked me what Donald Trump's healthcare plan was, I could tell you very specifically what it is.
[03:44:39.500 --> 03:44:44.500]  I've looked at it. I'm not his campaign manager. I'm a voter, okay?
[03:44:44.500 --> 03:44:48.500]  I want to know what these people say they're going to do about particular issues.
[03:44:48.500 --> 03:44:54.500]  So here's her campaign manager keeps putting out these talking points that she has a clear, decisive plan to defeat ISIS,
[03:44:54.500 --> 03:44:58.500]  and Trump doesn't, and yet he cannot provide any details.
[03:44:58.500 --> 03:45:02.500]  And he continually says, no, I can't tell you. You'd have to talk to her about that.
[03:45:02.500 --> 03:45:07.500]  At which point, even Joe Scarborough, these people love Hillary Clinton.
[03:45:07.500 --> 03:45:11.500]  They hate Donald Trump. And Joe Scarborough says, we love you, buddy.
[03:45:11.500 --> 03:45:13.500]  But why are you here? What are you here for?
[03:45:13.500 --> 03:45:20.500]  If you can't explain her clear, decisive plan, even though we love you and we love Hillary, why are you here?
[03:45:20.500 --> 03:45:29.500]  Okay? And they go on and actually make the comparison, the obvious comparison to the Aleppo moment that Gary Johnson had.
[03:45:29.500 --> 03:45:32.500]  Scarborough likened it to the Aleppo moment.
[03:45:32.500 --> 03:45:38.500]  And he says, well, you've been saying that Donald Trump won't tell us what the policy is here, but you're not telling us what the policy is.
[03:45:38.500 --> 03:45:40.500]  That's a co-anchor of Willie Geist.
[03:45:40.500 --> 03:45:45.500]  So we see yet again the emptiness of the Hillary Clinton campaign.
[03:45:45.500 --> 03:45:51.500]  And I think nothing illustrates this better than the things that they've chosen to focus on.
[03:45:51.500 --> 03:45:57.500]  As I pointed out earlier in the show, I want to talk about Skittles today, because that's what Hillary Clinton wants to talk about.
[03:45:57.500 --> 03:46:00.500]  Last week, it was all about Pepe the Frog.
[03:46:00.500 --> 03:46:07.500]  Look, they tweeted out this meme that had Donald Trump and Pepe the Frog and Alex Jones.
[03:46:07.500 --> 03:46:10.500]  And that was just horrible. See, they are really deplorable.
[03:46:10.500 --> 03:46:15.500]  Pepe the Frog and Alex Jones, I mean, that's just awful. And Donald Trump Jr. was on there and he retweeted that.
[03:46:15.500 --> 03:46:18.500]  And so did Trump's other son, Eric, and so forth.
[03:46:18.500 --> 03:46:23.500]  Well, after talking about Pepe the Frog last week, now this week it's all about Skittles.
[03:46:23.500 --> 03:46:25.500]  Why are they talking about it?
[03:46:25.500 --> 03:46:30.500]  Well, if you haven't seen this little tempest in a teapot that the Democrats create, and why do they do this?
[03:46:30.500 --> 03:46:33.500]  Why do they focus on Skittles and cartoon characters week after week?
[03:46:33.500 --> 03:46:37.500]  It's because they have nothing to talk about, just like they don't have a plan for Syria.
[03:46:37.500 --> 03:46:41.500]  They don't have a plan to stop ISIS. They want to keep that going.
[03:46:41.500 --> 03:46:47.500]  And she doesn't have a plan for anything. She has absolutely no accomplishments.
[03:46:47.500 --> 03:46:52.500]  If you want to believe that she didn't deliberately set the Middle East on fire,
[03:46:52.500 --> 03:47:00.500]  if you want to believe that she didn't deliberately go in and take out Momar Gaddafi and brag about it,
[03:47:00.500 --> 03:47:03.500]  then she is incredibly incompetent.
[03:47:03.500 --> 03:47:08.500]  But she's a liar and a criminal. I tend to believe that she did it on purpose, okay?
[03:47:08.500 --> 03:47:14.500]  But when we look at the refugee situation, the tweet that was put out by Donald Trump Jr.
[03:47:14.500 --> 03:47:18.500]  was one that's been around for a while. He just retweeted this meme about immigration.
[03:47:18.500 --> 03:47:20.500]  You can see it right there on the screen.
[03:47:20.500 --> 03:47:25.500]  If I had a bowl of Skittles and I told you that three of these Skittles would kill you, would you take a handful?
[03:47:25.500 --> 03:47:29.500]  He says, that's our Syrian refugee problem.
[03:47:29.500 --> 03:47:34.500]  And they went ballistic. That's all the left can talk about now is the Skittle thing.
[03:47:34.500 --> 03:47:40.500]  We've got the Hill saying that today, Luis Guterres, a Democrat congressman from Illinois,
[03:47:40.500 --> 03:47:45.500]  a big open border guy, brought in a bag of Skittles to a house hearing today.
[03:47:45.500 --> 03:47:49.500]  He ate the Skittles as he mocked Donald Trump.
[03:47:49.500 --> 03:47:54.500]  And he said, I really love Skittles because, as you see, they come in orange and yellow and red and purple,
[03:47:54.500 --> 03:48:00.500]  all the different colors, they all come together in a bag kind of like a rainbow.
[03:48:00.500 --> 03:48:03.500]  Isn't that wonderful? The diversity of Skittles.
[03:48:03.500 --> 03:48:09.500]  And he goes, every now and then, I get a bad Skittle, but I don't ban them all because I get one.
[03:48:09.500 --> 03:48:15.500]  Which I would say, well, you know, by bad Skittle, is that a Skittle that killed you?
[03:48:15.500 --> 03:48:21.500]  A Skittle that would kill your family like an explosive Skittle or something like that.
[03:48:21.500 --> 03:48:26.500]  He's missing the point completely. And yet, we also have NPR jumps in on it too.
[03:48:26.500 --> 03:48:32.500]  This is the banality and the triviality, the way these people come after him.
[03:48:32.500 --> 03:48:40.500]  It's just so incredibly petty. NPR says, Trump Jr.'s Skittles photo was taken by a former refugee,
[03:48:40.500 --> 03:48:43.500]  and it was used without his permission.
[03:48:43.500 --> 03:48:47.500]  Well, there's such a thing as fair use, and that applies to parody.
[03:48:47.500 --> 03:48:51.500]  It applies to political speech.
[03:48:51.500 --> 03:48:57.500]  And what it shows, of course, is that their first instinct is to censor people.
[03:48:57.500 --> 03:49:02.500]  Take that down. I don't want you putting that up there. That was a photograph I took of a bowl of Skittles.
[03:49:02.500 --> 03:49:07.500]  High artwork there. I mean, who can take a picture of a bowl of Skittles?
[03:49:07.500 --> 03:49:09.500]  Anyway, that's his picture. He doesn't want it used.
[03:49:09.500 --> 03:49:13.500]  But you know what? He can't really do anything about it because it's fair use.
[03:49:13.500 --> 03:49:19.500]  As I said before, parody, political speech, we don't let you copyright that type of stuff.
[03:49:19.500 --> 03:49:22.500]  But here's the key one, I think, and this is from the Hill.
[03:49:22.500 --> 03:49:25.500]  Stuart Shapiro, who is a contributing editor, he said the Skittles tweet shows
[03:49:25.500 --> 03:49:28.500]  what Trump Jr. doesn't get about the refugee risk.
[03:49:28.500 --> 03:49:33.500]  Actually, this editorial shows what the left doesn't get about the refugee problem
[03:49:33.500 --> 03:49:35.500]  and what it's doing to our country.
[03:49:35.500 --> 03:49:40.500]  Okay, so he says, putting aside the offensive nature of comparing human beings to poison candy
[03:49:40.500 --> 03:49:43.500]  and the possible Nazi origins of the meme,
[03:49:43.500 --> 03:49:47.500]  always going back to calling people Nazis if you don't agree with them.
[03:49:47.500 --> 03:49:50.500]  Two tactics, three tactics, okay?
[03:49:50.500 --> 03:49:56.500]  Call people Nazis, censor them, call them racist, call them deplorable, okay?
[03:49:56.500 --> 03:49:59.500]  But he says, while we have no way of reliably estimating
[03:49:59.500 --> 03:50:03.500]  what percentage of any group of individuals would possibly attempt a terrorist attack,
[03:50:03.500 --> 03:50:07.500]  it is clearly much lower than 1%.
[03:50:07.500 --> 03:50:12.500]  Think about that. He says, we don't have any way to reliably estimate it,
[03:50:12.500 --> 03:50:14.500]  but it's got to be lower than 1%. Really?
[03:50:14.500 --> 03:50:16.500]  Well then, if you have no way of reliably estimating this,
[03:50:16.500 --> 03:50:20.500]  then what you just said about it being less than 1% is just total nonsense.
[03:50:20.500 --> 03:50:23.500]  Shapiro, what's his name? Yeah, Stuart Shapiro.
[03:50:23.500 --> 03:50:28.500]  Stuart Shapiro, your sentence is totally illogical, okay?
[03:50:28.500 --> 03:50:31.500]  Take the German estimate, for example, okay?
[03:50:31.500 --> 03:50:33.500]  They thought it's less than 1%.
[03:50:33.500 --> 03:50:39.500]  They said, we let in 500,000 people and folks, we think 500 of them might be violent jihadis.
[03:50:39.500 --> 03:50:43.500]  That's 1 tenth of 1%. That's 1 in 1,000.
[03:50:43.500 --> 03:50:45.500]  Is that the chance that we should take?
[03:50:45.500 --> 03:50:48.500]  Who decides that we should take that chance?
[03:50:48.500 --> 03:50:51.500]  I wasn't asked. Our elected representatives weren't asked.
[03:50:51.500 --> 03:50:55.500]  You are going to be asked on this election, November 8th.
[03:50:55.500 --> 03:50:58.500]  You're going to be asked if you want to take that 1 in 1,000,
[03:50:58.500 --> 03:51:00.500]  or maybe it's 1 in 100 chance.
[03:51:00.500 --> 03:51:03.500]  Extendivite is more than just a heart tonic.
[03:51:03.500 --> 03:51:07.500]  Most basic diseases are caused by yeast in the gut and metals in the liver,
[03:51:07.500 --> 03:51:09.500]  and we all have a bit of both.
[03:51:09.500 --> 03:51:12.500]  The garlic in Extendivite has a yeast-killing effect in the gut,
[03:51:12.500 --> 03:51:16.500]  while also helping the sulfur enzyme in the liver get rid of the metals.
[03:51:16.500 --> 03:51:20.500]  Extendivite just may improve your overall health.
[03:51:20.500 --> 03:51:25.500]  Products like Extendivite are the only way we're going to get our society healthy.
[03:51:25.500 --> 03:51:29.500]  And if you're waiting for the government in pharmaceutical care to solve your health problems,
[03:51:29.500 --> 03:51:33.500]  you're going to have a long disappointing wait, I think.
[03:51:33.500 --> 03:51:37.500]  Extendivite is a complete formula for extended life in the new millennium.
[03:51:37.500 --> 03:51:39.500]  80 can be the new 60.
[03:51:39.500 --> 03:51:44.500]  Extendivite is available in capsule or liquid form for just $69.95 for a two-month supply.
