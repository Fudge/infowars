[00:00.000 --> 00:11.340]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.340 --> 00:18.880]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:18.880 --> 00:39.360]  Texas Alex Jones can't believe it's Friday just amazing the weeks just
[00:39.360 --> 00:44.800]  flash by like the twinkling of an eye faster and faster and faster as we
[00:44.800 --> 00:49.440]  hurdle into the fall and winter and whatever the globalist have planned for
[00:49.440 --> 00:53.680]  us it's clear that they're planning something big something really special
[00:53.680 --> 00:57.920]  for the Republic in an attempt to ram through their new Bank of the World
[00:57.920 --> 01:02.280]  their new global carbon tax their socialized death care their eugenics
[01:02.280 --> 01:09.880]  care their open borders their gun confiscation ladies and gentlemen you
[01:09.880 --> 01:14.600]  know in the middle of 2008 the Pentagon announced in the Army times what we
[01:14.600 --> 01:19.040]  already knew years before but just confirmed it that 20,000 regular Army
[01:19.040 --> 01:23.720]  troops were gays homeland would patrol America and quote pull triggers on
[01:23.720 --> 01:29.640]  American citizens during civil unrest magically knowing what was coming in the
[01:29.640 --> 01:38.080]  future now they're announcing 400,000 military personnel in the US so they go
[01:38.080 --> 01:43.040]  from 20,000 to 400,000 and I've repeatedly made the point that's why
[01:43.040 --> 01:47.400]  they're trying to swell the military ranks to have a million-person domestic
[01:47.400 --> 01:53.880]  auxiliary federal police force and then around a half a million regular Army and
[01:53.880 --> 01:57.000]  they are going to run every faster to your life when you go to their drills
[01:57.000 --> 02:01.560]  they are training to take your farms and ranches see first they tell you that
[02:01.560 --> 02:06.920]  they're going to try to fight Al Qaeda and just give up your rights to fight
[02:06.920 --> 02:10.800]  Al Qaeda and you say yeah you know we're setting all this big federal takeover
[02:10.800 --> 02:15.960]  up to fight brown people 8,000 miles away I guess it's okay you know they ran
[02:15.960 --> 02:20.600]  the attacks from the caves and Easter bunnies come down the chimney and put
[02:20.600 --> 02:26.960]  presents under the tree at Christmas time it's all true the Chinese jet pilots
[02:26.960 --> 02:32.800]  are orbiting Pluto and they lay Christmas eggs under the tree as well so
[02:32.800 --> 02:36.480]  it's just you know completely made up totally ridiculous if you believe in the
[02:36.480 --> 02:42.160]  truth very fine that Al Qaeda did 9-11 the point is now they're saying
[02:42.160 --> 02:47.240]  homeland security is for the American people and the number one threat is gun
[02:47.240 --> 02:51.480]  owners and returning veterans that's official and they want to use 400
[02:51.480 --> 02:57.840]  military 400,000 military mainly felons and illegal aliens that's the new
[02:57.840 --> 03:02.280]  majority of the new force the new force the majority of the new forces they're
[03:02.280 --> 03:09.160]  getting are felons or illegal aliens a true foreign army right here to bust the
[03:09.160 --> 03:15.520]  chops to make the American people submit and so that's out of the progressive
[03:15.520 --> 03:23.840]  magazine and this is from a Pentagon announcement so we're going to cover that
[03:23.840 --> 03:30.400]  also on the whole health care front the White House is hiring people five
[03:30.400 --> 03:35.960]  hundred dollars a week to go out and be supporters of it so that's how your and
[03:35.960 --> 03:40.560]  and different private foundations and groups and others are also funding
[03:40.560 --> 03:44.960]  similar things so we'll go over that and they're equating protesting against
[03:44.960 --> 03:49.920]  Obama with fear for Obama's safety grows as hate groups thrive on radical
[03:49.920 --> 03:54.760]  backlash so basically you're a Klan member if you don't want to turn your
[03:54.760 --> 04:01.640]  guns in also emails from public overload White House website the AP doesn't say
[04:01.640 --> 04:05.840]  whether it's pro or con you know it's against the death care the eugenics
[04:05.840 --> 04:11.800]  care but again shutting down the White House website senators exclude end of
[04:11.800 --> 04:16.960]  life provision from the bill so they've struck that for now the New York Times is
[04:16.960 --> 04:21.120]  saying the death panel rumor is made up by Republicans I know it comes out of
[04:21.120 --> 04:25.520]  Tom Daschle's own book I mean come on we know what goes on in England we know
[04:25.520 --> 04:30.200]  what I mean we they it's in their own policies of course they say they're
[04:30.200 --> 04:34.360]  gonna not give people the medical tests they need and things rationing care I
[04:34.360 --> 04:38.600]  mean come on that's why nobody believes anything you say cuz you've been caught
[04:38.600 --> 04:44.640]  lying you're saying we're the liars when you're the liars and it comes out
[04:44.640 --> 04:47.960]  actually big insurance companies and Republican groups are quietly funding
[04:47.960 --> 04:52.160]  the health care takeover they play to the same sheet of music look it's all
[04:52.160 --> 04:55.720]  coming up we'll tell you about the guest as well when we officially start the

[08:18.320 --> 08:25.480]  well we've got a huge jam-pack radio show today I'm gonna news blitz right now
[08:25.480 --> 08:32.240]  then we're gonna open the phones up in the second third and fourth hour today we
[08:32.240 --> 08:41.200]  have a Stuart Rhodes joining us he of course is a Yale Law School graduate a
[08:41.200 --> 08:50.960]  airborne Ranger special forces and he started Oathkeepers he worked in the
[08:50.960 --> 08:55.920]  congressional staff for Congressman Ron Paul has an impeccable record he was
[08:55.920 --> 09:01.000]  demonized as some type of vicious murdering terrorist along with myself
[09:01.000 --> 09:09.920]  in the Southern Primary Law Center's latest hit piece I mean it might as well
[09:09.920 --> 09:16.720]  be a death warrant on us might as well be a giant crosshairs painted on the on
[09:16.720 --> 09:21.560]  our backs their latest letter of mark is probably the most accurate way to
[09:21.560 --> 09:26.800]  describe it against us so I wanted to go over that report today in the second
[09:26.800 --> 09:32.800]  hour with him very very ominous I've been explaining for months and months that
[09:32.800 --> 09:37.880]  if they launch a demonization of militias well what they do is they say
[09:37.880 --> 09:43.480]  white supremacist militias gun owners so see first they say white supremacist
[09:43.480 --> 09:47.320]  and they demonize militias by connecting them to white supremacist and they
[09:47.320 --> 09:51.880]  demonize gun owners by connecting them to militias and that's what the DHS
[09:51.880 --> 09:58.120]  report to do and it's here it's now happening and I of course in their
[09:58.120 --> 10:04.360]  number one target I do not enjoy that it does make the air on the back of my
[10:04.360 --> 10:14.960]  neck stand up not pleasing but at a certain level it is gratifying
[10:14.960 --> 10:20.480]  emotionally it is not pleasing or gratifying but at a very very cold level
[10:20.480 --> 10:26.440]  of my psyche where we're waging war against the new world order system and
[10:26.440 --> 10:30.280]  trying to expose these eugenicist parasites these criminals these records
[10:30.280 --> 10:34.800]  it is a very satisfying because it means we're hurting them and having an
[10:34.800 --> 10:39.960]  effect it lets me know I'm doing my job in a big way when they turn loose
[10:39.960 --> 10:44.200]  legions of co-intel pro against me well proof is in the pudding look at the
[10:44.200 --> 10:49.960]  fruits of what we've bore what the tree has produced and I just want to come in
[10:49.960 --> 10:55.840]  my crew everybody that runs the radio TV show the salespeople the graphics
[10:55.840 --> 11:01.120]  folks the video people the webmasters the writers and you the listeners who've
[11:01.120 --> 11:05.360]  spread the word and carried our videos across the planet our articles our
[11:05.360 --> 11:10.240]  films our books our materials the guest we have on this is a launchpad that's
[11:10.240 --> 11:16.200]  what we are this radio show is a giant missile base a missile factory and we
[11:16.200 --> 11:20.520]  just fire missiles at the new world order huge missiles in the info war and
[11:20.520 --> 11:26.360]  we train people to build more missile bases we're really a missile base factory
[11:26.360 --> 11:30.680]  we produce factories that make other missile bases the more I think about it
[11:30.680 --> 11:35.040]  and so don't let the globalist distracts you or diverts you you know you're a
[11:35.040 --> 11:39.520]  leader you know you're good you know you're fighting the new world order you
[11:39.520 --> 11:43.440]  know you can have success and have had success that we've had success and so
[11:43.440 --> 11:48.080]  just set up your own operation and start blasting the enemy in the info war
[11:48.080 --> 11:56.320]  and mercilessly mercilessly take them on so let me run down what's coming up
[11:56.320 --> 12:02.920]  today and then I'm again to the news Stuart Rhodes joining us Bob Chapman
[12:02.920 --> 12:07.480]  coming on with his hourly visit his weekly hourly visit on the economy and
[12:07.480 --> 12:11.920]  what's happening there boy big developments there and then we have a very
[12:11.920 --> 12:17.160]  interesting surprise guest scheduled in the last hour of the show today and
[12:17.160 --> 12:22.520]  normally our surprise guest show up for the show but this surprise guest didn't
[12:22.520 --> 12:25.600]  show up last week we had another surprise guest that didn't show up
[12:25.600 --> 12:31.320]  yesterday but that surprise guest is rescheduled for the third time for Monday
[12:31.320 --> 12:38.680]  this surprise guest is scheduled for this for the second time today you're
[12:38.680 --> 12:47.280]  going to tell me something yeah yeah Monday for the other surprise guest so
[12:47.280 --> 12:51.880]  we'll just leave it at that folks you know normally when I have a surprise
[12:51.880 --> 12:55.960]  guest that actually show up but at this point we're trying to reschedule these
[12:55.960 --> 12:59.160]  guys one more time if they don't show up but I won't be announcing it's a
[12:59.160 --> 13:03.080]  surprise guest they'll just they'll just be on the show
[13:03.080 --> 13:12.600]  and like we had a perfect batting average with surprise guest until as of late so
[13:12.600 --> 13:18.040]  again Stuart Rhodes Bob Chapman and then Ellen Keys there I just let out the
[13:18.040 --> 13:21.160]  surprise guest we'll see if he actually shows up for the show today I'm tired of
[13:21.160 --> 13:27.040]  saying surprise guest he shows up he shows up we'll talk to him about a host of
[13:27.040 --> 13:33.040]  issues that's the problem having a surprise guest written down a piece of
[13:33.040 --> 13:37.680]  paper in front of you no longer surprise but I'm excited about that talk about a
[13:37.680 --> 13:45.080]  host issues with the ambassador if this is on a council of ship where it is the
[13:45.080 --> 13:59.800]  ambassador okay I want to I've got all this new top news top story information
[13:59.800 --> 14:06.280]  to cover that's all very important but I look at these headlines from yesterday
[14:06.280 --> 14:12.680]  then I spent some time on but you can't just it's almost a disservice if I come
[14:12.680 --> 14:21.400]  on air and I mentioned these headlines read a few paragraphs and then don't
[14:21.400 --> 14:26.520]  ask callers to call in and comment on it and don't make a big deal out of it it
[14:26.520 --> 14:33.680]  actually desensitizes not just the listeners but myself and I really catch
[14:33.680 --> 14:38.160]  myself every day getting conditioned to accept all of this I mean I get up here
[14:38.160 --> 14:41.800]  and jump up and down and say this is a big deal this is bad this is serious we
[14:41.800 --> 14:45.160]  need to get angry and certainly the public's getting upset and getting
[14:45.160 --> 14:48.680]  angry and getting motivated and getting in the streets and real issues of gun
[14:48.680 --> 14:52.480]  confiscation and martial law are now being discussed and forced in
[14:52.480 --> 14:59.960]  oculations are being discussed and cancer viruses in the new flu vaccine I
[14:59.960 --> 15:06.040]  mean that's mainstream news but we need to get even more upset more in the
[15:06.040 --> 15:12.600]  streets more angry I mean this is a big deal and so some people accused me of
[15:12.600 --> 15:15.520]  making a bigger deal out of things than they are I mean can we just pinch
[15:15.520 --> 15:20.560]  ourselves they've got more than 15 bills introduced that effectively in the
[15:20.560 --> 15:23.880]  Second Amendment and I've had Second Amendment groups on and read those
[15:23.880 --> 15:27.480]  bills at nauseam go to gun owners of America and read their legislative
[15:27.480 --> 15:31.360]  updates if you're hiding under a rock somewhere and haven't been paying
[15:31.360 --> 15:35.240]  attention and then you've got the media running a hoax saying none of those
[15:35.240 --> 15:40.200]  bills exist and you've got them saying there isn't rationed care and there
[15:40.200 --> 15:43.200]  isn't instant access to your bank accounts under this system and there
[15:43.200 --> 15:53.440]  isn't there's just so much going on I I cannot stress enough everything is
[15:53.440 --> 15:58.600]  happening right now this is the big new world order move they are throwing
[15:58.600 --> 16:03.920]  everything including the kitchen sink at us right now and we need everybody
[16:03.920 --> 16:13.600]  active everybody informed and everybody out informing others I mean look at these
[16:13.600 --> 16:17.520]  headlines from yesterday congressman Obama could use pandemic to declare
[16:17.520 --> 16:21.920]  martial law we're working on him ours from Paul Brown in town halls this is out
[16:21.920 --> 16:33.560]  of the Louisville newspapers and others is saying mainstream news that they're
[16:33.560 --> 16:36.960]  gonna use it as a cover for martial law and then the National Governors
[16:36.960 --> 16:42.400]  Association saying the same thing that's in the Associated Press I mean it's not
[16:42.400 --> 16:48.000]  Alex Jones saying this it's the heads of the National Governors Association the
[16:48.000 --> 16:53.480]  last head they were scared of they just shot down for whatever reasons they
[16:53.480 --> 16:58.400]  found something wrong in his background a mistress a girlfriend I'm not saying
[16:58.400 --> 17:03.560]  that's good the point is it's nothing comparing Barney Frank and have little
[17:03.560 --> 17:08.200]  kids in it in his in his house with him running under you know slave brothels I
[17:08.200 --> 17:13.880]  mean and then he doesn't get in trouble but you start telling the Fed you're
[17:13.880 --> 17:17.600]  not gonna let him take over you got a girlfriend in Argentina it's over folks
[17:17.600 --> 17:23.000]  that's all over the news or governor Spitzer exposing the banker scam and
[17:23.000 --> 17:28.200]  Goldman Sachs he wrote an editorial about that about how it was all a Ponzi
[17:28.200 --> 17:32.480]  scheme before all this came down the FBI had him under total surveillance and
[17:32.480 --> 17:37.280]  boom what he did with a hooker and even the sorted details came out to
[17:37.280 --> 17:45.440]  destroy him and I'm not saying visiting hookers is a good thing but it's a lot
[17:45.440 --> 17:51.120]  better than having 12 year old kids at your house 12 year old little boys it's
[17:51.120 --> 17:56.480]  all let me tell you going to a consenting 25 year old woman is a lot
[17:56.480 --> 18:01.000]  better than little kids now maybe call an extremist for that or a or a bigot or
[18:01.000 --> 18:05.000]  something but I think I think abusing little kids is wrong I know people are
[18:05.000 --> 18:08.120]  trying to make it mainstream and they're trying to pass hate crimes laws
[18:08.120 --> 18:11.960]  that's in the new hate crime bill that if you criticize that you're you you get
[18:11.960 --> 18:15.560]  in trouble I mean what's next I mean if I say it's wrong to have sex with a
[18:15.560 --> 18:22.520]  donkey I mean I mean well then I'm gonna be arrested you people are out of your
[18:22.520 --> 18:29.040]  minds I just don't know what your problems are I mean a Barney Frank wants

[18:32.880 --> 18:39.560]  him over that but if he he's got young teenagers running a underage brothel out
[18:39.560 --> 18:44.840]  of his house I don't want to hear about the governors with hookers or girlfriends

[18:57.440 --> 19:03.920]  governor with a mistress I don't want to hear about it excuse me the point is is
[19:03.920 --> 19:10.600]  that they're going after these people who have got tiny skeletons in their
[19:10.600 --> 19:19.320]  closet compared to humongous mausoleums of skeletons look I've just got to go

[24:11.920 --> 24:18.520]  credit for the Los Angeles posters and blaming me my wife speaks Spanish and so
[24:18.520 --> 24:22.200]  I had her watch two different Spanish newscasts this morning where they're
[24:22.200 --> 24:28.840]  calling for my arrest as a racist they're saying in these newscasts that it's
[24:28.840 --> 24:32.160]  racist that it's because we have a president who for the first time has
[24:32.160 --> 24:38.080]  dark skin that I don't like him and that I need to be arrested I mean in
[24:38.080 --> 24:42.160]  America Obama went I remember when he went on television and said great job
[24:42.160 --> 24:47.120]  hanging up my posters and he he used it as official campaign he said put him up
[24:47.120 --> 24:50.800]  on stop signs we have the Washington Post with him quoted saying that he wrote
[24:50.800 --> 24:55.640]  a letter to the constituent the famous poster artist thanking him for putting
[24:55.640 --> 25:00.240]  him on stop signs so the president can tell his people put it on stop signs I
[25:00.240 --> 25:04.240]  say in the contest follow your local rules but post it where all the posters
[25:04.240 --> 25:10.760]  are at and we're even seeing them being pulled down in areas by bars and you
[25:10.760 --> 25:14.200]  know areas where people do hang posters they'll leave up the rock and roll
[25:14.200 --> 25:19.000]  poster or the poster about the church or the poster about a lost dog or about a
[25:19.000 --> 25:35.360]  garage sale but if you criticize Obama it is all over ladies and gentlemen and
[25:35.360 --> 25:38.920]  they say they have a whole team of police in Claremont Florida that's I
[25:38.920 --> 25:42.480]  guess the county that Orlando's in and they've got all these people on the
[25:42.480 --> 25:47.600]  news hyperventilating saying how scary it is and I haven't played in these clips
[25:47.600 --> 25:51.760]  here on air because there's been so many other big news stories going on open
[25:51.760 --> 25:55.880]  announcements of preparations for martial law open announcements of forced
[25:55.880 --> 26:01.520]  inoculations mainline scientists and major publications saying that the
[26:01.520 --> 26:05.840]  current flu vaccine they bought 195 million doses of about another 100
[26:05.840 --> 26:09.840]  million so one for everybody in the country is grown on dead baby retinas
[26:09.840 --> 26:16.640]  and has cancer viruses in it for some reason that's mainstream news and and
[26:16.640 --> 26:22.280]  we've got just all these incredible things happening meanwhile two weeks ago
[26:22.280 --> 26:27.160]  I saw them saying it was illegal it was bad it was racist that somebody put up
[26:27.160 --> 26:31.920]  Obama socialism posters so I said you know that's a good way to defile this
[26:31.920 --> 26:36.880]  puppet leader to to to to get rid of this angel like image he's got and let
[26:36.880 --> 26:41.840]  people know that he's not above ridicule like we did with Bush we've got to pull
[26:41.840 --> 26:44.880]  down their symbols they're using to push their agenda through so I said we're
[26:44.880 --> 26:48.080]  gonna put it up and we're gonna post these flyers if you want to mark dice
[26:48.080 --> 26:52.440]  did it before us he actually gave me the idea to have a contest as a good good
[26:52.440 --> 26:56.560]  idea mark dice we linked to his contest and we also put up ours and we said but
[26:56.560 --> 27:00.240]  he's more of a fascist so we'll have socialist and fascist posters you can
[27:00.240 --> 27:05.200]  print off then people started hanging them up and I noticed that I guess this is
[27:05.200 --> 27:10.160]  right before I announced the contest when I just posted the posters and I went
[27:10.160 --> 27:13.000]  on air I said now be careful folks because they're gonna politically say
[27:13.000 --> 27:16.360]  you're a terrorist be sure you hang these in legal areas and we said that day
[27:16.360 --> 27:20.760]  one with the contest so we're covered liability wise but still people are bold
[27:20.760 --> 27:24.440]  they're sick of the tyranny all the new not all but many of the new videos were
[27:24.440 --> 27:28.320]  being sent people are aggressively putting them up on post offices on
[27:28.320 --> 27:32.680]  purpose they're aggressively sticking them on government buildings because
[27:32.680 --> 27:37.360]  they're sick of the government I mean these are people filming themselves
[27:37.360 --> 27:40.880]  doing it these are new videos you can look at when they upload you can look at
[27:40.880 --> 27:47.160]  that you know when they're producing them and so again folks you need also I
[27:47.160 --> 27:50.200]  think people are seeing the other contest that are going on with Mark
[27:50.200 --> 27:55.200]  Dice my contest the original group putting up the socialists the socialism
[27:55.200 --> 28:00.560]  posters and so people aren't even going to our contest page they're not even
[28:00.560 --> 28:03.480]  going to our contest videos they're doing this on our own because I'm seeing
[28:03.480 --> 28:09.320]  them with Michelle Obama I'm seeing them with George Bush everywhere and not
[28:09.320 --> 28:14.240]  posters we made we have a George Bush version I'm not I'm seeing this is just
[28:14.240 --> 28:19.000]  spontaneous kind of like I picked up off of what some unnamed person was doing
[28:19.000 --> 28:24.280]  and Mark Dice picked up off of them I picked up off of Mark Dice and this
[28:24.280 --> 28:28.480]  thing is just getting bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and
[28:28.480 --> 28:32.360]  bigger and bigger but we're also seeing selective enforcement when Michael
[28:32.360 --> 28:36.760]  Reagan said I am hiring people for the murder of Mark Dice and other 9-11
[28:36.760 --> 28:41.200]  truthers I will pay you to murder them I will pay you money he didn't get in
[28:41.200 --> 28:49.680]  trouble 300 radio stations 10 million listeners at least huge website he said
[28:49.680 --> 28:54.880]  murder us put us you'll kill us hunt us down shoot us I'm serious he said murder
[28:54.880 --> 29:03.360]  them but then somebody on info wars.com said go after the cop that killed the
[29:03.360 --> 29:08.160]  poor black guy by shooting him in the back on the dart platform you know the
[29:08.160 --> 29:13.960]  dart train platform it's called Dart there in San Francisco and they went
[29:13.960 --> 29:17.240]  arrested him and died at him and last time I heard he's plea bargaining and
[29:17.240 --> 29:21.480]  you can just Google Alex Jones F the pigs and that's the keyword search and
[29:21.480 --> 29:27.320]  that's the headlines and the AP and wire magazine that was his handle so Michael
[29:27.320 --> 29:32.320]  Reagan can say kill us that that's good solicit murder nationwide that's good
[29:32.320 --> 29:40.320]  according to them but then say go after a cop then you're going to go to jail now
[29:40.320 --> 29:43.920]  it's the same thing here Obama can say put pictures of me up everywhere
[29:43.920 --> 29:47.800]  worshipping me put them up on government property it's Hale but you put it up on
[29:47.800 --> 29:52.400]  white polls and it's not worshipping or in trouble we're on the March the

[34:32.120 --> 34:36.880]  the list goes on and on on record saying they've been threatened with martial
[34:36.880 --> 34:42.800]  law and it's continuing into this administration because the president's
[34:42.800 --> 34:50.720]  work for the shadow government Northcom the National Security Council runs the
[34:50.720 --> 34:57.880]  country and it's run by foreign banks period the military runs the NSA they
[34:57.880 --> 35:02.560]  run FEMA now if you have watched online FEMA press conferences its generals its
[35:02.560 --> 35:06.320]  admirals with troops standing behind them they've already taken over it's
[35:06.320 --> 35:11.440]  already happened they're just doing it in plain view like it's normal yet there
[35:11.440 --> 35:17.120]  is nothing more American I told people a month ago my idea was to have people
[35:17.120 --> 35:26.320]  print up flyers that say don't take the flu vaccine and then have a website
[35:26.320 --> 35:32.120]  address that has the facts under it and we've had sherry 10 penny the doctor on
[35:32.120 --> 35:37.080]  who's got flyers on her site and fact sheets and I've had other doctors on and
[35:37.080 --> 35:43.440]  we're just here trying to warn people I mean go out and do that the issue is we
[35:43.440 --> 35:48.280]  knew the stupid media the controlled corporate horror media who operated
[35:48.280 --> 35:51.520]  about a third-grade level and I mean that when I say it would pick up on the
[35:51.520 --> 35:54.800]  Joker and we knew they'd say it was bad and evil and racist and then that would
[35:54.800 --> 35:58.920]  point out their hypocrisy because everybody's fished out the photos of
[35:58.920 --> 36:05.680]  posters plastered as Bush as a vampire and Bush as a Joker and a bunch of and
[36:05.680 --> 36:09.160]  Bush is a monkey that was one of the most popular those things were all over
[36:09.160 --> 36:15.240]  my town where I live in Austin and nobody said it was racist then no he's the
[36:15.240 --> 36:19.960]  president he's the most public figure you can be in the world he is trying to
[36:19.960 --> 36:30.040]  cram through an unpopular agenda and so now in Claremont and Orlando and now
[36:30.040 --> 36:37.480]  national news as well man admits to putting up 500 Obama posters as Joker
[36:37.480 --> 36:41.120]  posters police at Claremont have one suspect that is admitted to putting up
[36:41.120 --> 36:44.880]  dozens of posters around the city but in President Obama as the Joker character
[36:44.880 --> 36:49.320]  from a Batman movie you go watch these newscast we played a short clip from one
[36:49.320 --> 36:54.200]  there's like five of them or more more than five eight no there's eight of them
[36:54.200 --> 36:58.520]  I've seen you count the two Spanish there's six English I've seen two Spanish
[36:58.520 --> 37:03.080]  and the Spanish ones say I need to be arrested and they go into people who
[37:03.080 --> 37:07.480]  can't even speak English and they call for my arrest and they call for this
[37:07.480 --> 37:10.840]  guy's arrest and and and then they got all these old people on the other
[37:10.840 --> 37:14.840]  newscast going arrest whoever did it you're not supposed to do this it's
[37:14.840 --> 37:19.000]  un-American you're not supposed to disrespect our president of course you
[37:19.000 --> 37:24.840]  are so this country's all about they burned effigies and and put up effigies
[37:24.840 --> 37:32.120]  of George Washington hanging in all 13 colonies anybody who's seen the made for
[37:32.120 --> 37:38.960]  TV miniseries Adams John Adams very accurate I probably read more than a
[37:38.960 --> 37:44.840]  hundred history books on the Revolutionary War and the years after it
[37:44.840 --> 37:52.440]  I'm very into it it was worse than that they were running up at night to the
[37:52.440 --> 37:59.760]  presidential house it wasn't the White House at the time throwing buckets of
[37:59.760 --> 38:05.480]  night soil people you know their toilets they went to the bathroom in in brass
[38:05.480 --> 38:09.120]  containers and they were dumping that on the White House at night can you
[38:09.120 --> 38:14.240]  imagine and people wanted to have them shot and people wanted to have them
[38:14.240 --> 38:24.600]  arrested and George Washington said no now I got to be honest I don't think you
[38:24.600 --> 38:29.000]  should be dumping buckets of human waste on the White House but you know the
[38:29.000 --> 38:33.360]  issue here is that's what we've gone from that burning effigies of him all
[38:33.360 --> 38:37.600]  over the country and they came to him and said let's arrest these people and he
[38:37.600 --> 38:45.600]  said no we're not going to turn into what we just fought if they lay a hand on
[38:45.600 --> 38:49.920]  anybody then we'll individually they're due process of law through the juries
[38:49.920 --> 38:54.440]  and grand juries prosecute them now if you want to follow George Washington
[38:54.440 --> 38:58.880]  that's what you do but now we've got the point of oh my gosh arrest whoever did
[38:58.880 --> 39:05.000]  it it's horrible it's illegal and I've got the Southern Poverty Law Center for
[39:05.000 --> 39:09.840]  four months leaving up comments on their site saying I and others need to be
[39:09.840 --> 39:15.240]  killed that we need to be murdered for our political views
[39:17.560 --> 39:21.440]  Stewart Rhodes is coming up on that issue but this is fundamental to
[39:21.440 --> 39:25.040]  everything I mean I couldn't I mean I knew the media was gonna freak out over
[39:25.040 --> 39:29.440]  and I didn't think because the LA police didn't say we're gonna arrest whoever's
[39:29.440 --> 39:34.400]  putting up these socialism posters and they spread all over San Francisco and
[39:34.400 --> 39:38.760]  other areas of California but now they're San Francisco articles San
[39:38.760 --> 39:42.160]  Francisco articles you can pull up where they're where they've got my posters
[39:42.160 --> 39:48.560]  saying oh he's bad he's evil thank God they've been scraped off and you know we
[39:48.560 --> 39:59.520]  never took credit for the Obama posters in California though I'd love to we said
[39:59.520 --> 40:05.520]  it's a good idea and the media is trying to chill it and so we salute whoever's
[40:05.520 --> 40:08.720]  doing it and we think more people should do it make sure you follow your local
[40:08.720 --> 40:13.200]  laws and I will tell the people that are running around sticking them on mailboxes
[40:13.200 --> 40:16.960]  I mean there's videos people sneaking up behind police stations sticking them on
[40:16.960 --> 40:21.080]  the police stations they're sneaking up sticking them on post office boxes and
[40:21.080 --> 40:24.720]  it's totally American what you're doing and they're knitting and sucking their
[40:24.720 --> 40:30.400]  thumbs on TV going oh my gosh they're attacking federal facilities oh there's
[40:30.400 --> 40:37.080]  the victims a police are we're interviewing victims give it a break you
[40:37.080 --> 40:42.280]  un-American people I mean Florida really is a scary police state it turned out the
[40:42.280 --> 40:46.840]  last three directors of CPS in the state were child rapers not just pedophiles
[40:46.840 --> 40:52.440]  but Barney worse than Barney Frank nothing happens to him 3,000 plus kids
[40:52.440 --> 40:56.800]  missing CNN reports they find them buried I mean the state officials when
[40:56.800 --> 41:00.000]  they're done with a murder of them you don't care about dead kids do you know
[41:00.000 --> 41:04.680]  no no that's fun that's all in a day's work little kids you rape and then kill
[41:04.680 --> 41:09.680]  and bury in shallow graves Paul Watson's got links to it in our article about
[41:09.680 --> 41:14.000]  this no you're not worried about the dead kids in shallow graves or Barney
[41:14.000 --> 41:24.080]  Frank's rape rooms up in Georgetown what you are worried about is posters and
[41:24.080 --> 41:31.520]  that's because your thugs now maybe the media is distorting what the police are
[41:31.520 --> 41:34.520]  doing and distorting their quotes and maybe the cops know this is ridiculous
[41:34.520 --> 41:39.040]  running around it says they got a whole bunch of detectives on it full time and
[41:39.040 --> 41:44.480]  maybe maybe you're not idiots in Florida but in that county but I I I sincerely
[41:44.480 --> 41:48.240]  doubt it I mean you are by Disney World aren't you you are living in a make
[41:48.240 --> 41:51.440]  believe land let me give you the news flash cops there they've already taken
[41:51.440 --> 41:59.840]  your pensions you might as well join the American people so I really can't
[41:59.840 --> 42:03.160]  speak for the police because it's the media saying the police are saying this
[42:03.160 --> 42:09.640]  and I don't know but police and Claremont who one suspect that is
[42:09.640 --> 42:13.080]  admitted to putting up dozens of posters around the city expecting president
[42:13.080 --> 42:18.080]  Obama as the Joker character from the Batman movie but more people are
[42:18.080 --> 42:22.200]  believed to have been involved police say the man in custody admitted to putting
[42:22.200 --> 42:28.920]  up 500 of the posters the posters are tied to a national contest put on by the
[42:28.920 --> 42:33.080]  syndicated radio host who urges his fans to post the images of the president
[42:33.080 --> 42:37.880]  in exchange for a prize now it says the person that does it the most artfully
[42:37.880 --> 42:45.120]  and the best will get the price city officials still continue or unsure just
[42:45.120 --> 42:49.880]  how much damage was caused by the signs and the dollar amount associated with
[42:49.880 --> 42:54.920]  the cleanup and it shows them on telephone polls stapled up and they
[42:54.920 --> 42:59.000]  come over and go it's horrible it's terrible it's you've got to watch the
[42:59.000 --> 43:02.640]  videos to believe it and they look all upset and they're like shaking and they
[43:02.640 --> 43:06.600]  cut back to the anchor shaking their head oh this is just terrible but the
[43:06.600 --> 43:09.920]  state officials kidnapping and murdering children it's not we're not going to
[43:09.920 --> 43:12.760]  report on that for you
[43:13.040 --> 43:17.840]  Florida is the pedophile capital it's the happy hunting ground do you think
[43:17.840 --> 43:21.960]  they got the worst CPS everything do you think it's appropriate to use the
[43:21.960 --> 43:27.520]  Joker character to protest the health care issue the voting is now over but
[43:27.520 --> 43:31.840]  visit our viewer poll and we pull up this poll guys off this may article maybe
[43:31.840 --> 43:35.360]  maybe later after Stuart Rhodes leaders will play some of these ridiculous
[43:35.360 --> 43:40.480]  news clips I mean why I should I've seen eight of them at least and I don't have
[43:40.480 --> 43:43.120]  time I'm trying to make a film right now and deal with a bunch of other stuff to
[43:43.120 --> 43:46.960]  even follow all this but there's articles in Dallas and articles in New
[43:46.960 --> 43:51.200]  York and articles in San Francisco and articles in Los Angeles and articles in
[43:51.200 --> 43:55.840]  Detroit and articles in Tennessee I mean here's one from Tennessee safety
[43:55.840 --> 44:00.480]  concerns cited and removal of Obama Joker posters in Tennessee and the police
[44:00.480 --> 44:05.760]  are saying this is an act of vandalism and very dangerous to put them up on
[44:05.760 --> 44:13.440]  light poles and you can go read it it's out of the Greenville Sun such selective
[44:13.440 --> 44:19.920]  enforcement I mean I went out and stapled these up in front of police last
[44:19.920 --> 44:24.760]  week and they did nothing because the Austin police I guess are not Nazi
[44:24.760 --> 44:30.000]  thugs I guess they're actually Americans or the police chief in not perfect but
[44:30.000 --> 44:37.360]  you know he he doesn't I have them out arresting people because the places I
[44:37.360 --> 44:45.840]  posted these were on light poles that were already just covered with signs I
[44:45.840 --> 44:51.000]  drive by these signs all the time I did this you know near our office over here
[44:51.000 --> 44:59.560]  in the hood and I mean I'm right there with police car driving by stapling
[44:59.560 --> 45:04.440]  them up I mean I pretty soon they're gonna try to say breathing is illegal or
[45:04.440 --> 45:08.080]  something I mean are they gonna arrest the people that put up the yard signs or
[45:08.080 --> 45:12.720]  the church signs or the I saw one of these driving to work a few weeks ago a
[45:12.720 --> 45:18.200]  fire department benefit oh let's go arrest the fire department now I mean are
[45:18.200 --> 45:26.840]  you going to go arrest this is the big question are you going to go are you
[45:26.840 --> 45:34.800]  going to arrest then senator now president Obama last year we've got the
[45:34.800 --> 45:41.840]  Washington Post linked up see I've got all this news to cover and so this isn't
[45:41.840 --> 45:44.680]  we're not just spending this much time on this because it's about me or info
[45:44.680 --> 45:48.160]  wars.com of the contest it's about the first amendment and about how crazy
[45:48.160 --> 45:53.760]  this government's got do you think it's appropriate to use the Joker character
[45:53.760 --> 46:01.280]  to protest the health care issue 59% said yes 37% said no and this is in a
[46:01.280 --> 46:07.720]  slanted Orlando Florida news 13 TV piece that says arrest me with with with
[46:07.720 --> 46:11.400]  every person whining and crying they interview about how un-American and
[46:11.400 --> 46:21.800]  evil it is. Results if you found 2000 in cash would you return it yes I mean well
[46:21.800 --> 46:24.000]  why do they have these questions I guess there's a bunch of other polls in
[46:24.000 --> 46:32.560]  here so 59% notice that news result is the same about returning the cash I
[46:32.560 --> 46:37.200]  guarantee you the 59% that would return the cash or the 59% that think it's
[46:37.200 --> 46:42.120]  appropriate to use the Joker and I bet you my bottom dollar that the 37% that
[46:42.120 --> 46:47.720]  say the Joker posters wrong or the 37% that would steal your wallet I guarantee
[46:47.720 --> 46:52.000]  it notice those numbers are the same there we got to get a screenshot of this
[46:52.000 --> 46:58.520]  and get Paul to do an article on it or blurb results for if you found $2,000
[46:58.520 --> 47:05.720]  cash would you return it 59% would return it 40% said they'd keep it what
[47:05.720 --> 47:14.320]  kind of screwed up poll is that 40% would keep it I found wallets a couple
[47:14.320 --> 47:18.240]  times with money and I mean what what kind of crazy don't you understand that
[47:18.240 --> 47:25.200]  when you steal somebody's wallet it comes back on you I tell you what results
[47:25.200 --> 47:28.680]  for do you think it's appropriate to use the Joker character to protest the
[47:28.680 --> 47:34.840]  health care system 59% said yes 37% said no and you read the comments about 95
[47:34.840 --> 47:38.920]  percent are against news 13 and the other channels I mean literally you'll
[47:38.920 --> 47:43.320]  read three four pages of people that are going what's your problem this is
[47:43.320 --> 47:49.640]  hypocritical I saw anti-bush stickers and signs all over mailboxes and all
[47:49.640 --> 47:52.800]  over light poles and there was never all this knitting and freaking out we've
[47:52.800 --> 47:56.920]  got links to these people and then you'll see one guy who says he works for
[47:56.920 --> 48:01.680]  the TV station arguing and posting every five or six posts calling everyone
[48:01.680 --> 48:11.960]  racist I mean you people are nuts you think it's un-American to put up a
[48:11.960 --> 48:16.520]  thing saying fascist or socialist or New World Order under Obama on a light
[48:16.520 --> 48:22.680]  pole even if you disagree with it there's nothing more American and I can't
[48:22.680 --> 48:29.800]  believe I can't get this through your head but sure enough I tell you the
[48:29.800 --> 48:34.360]  Spanish Channel ones are the worst calling for my arrest
[48:34.360 --> 48:42.680]  and to call my wife into interpret and it's just something really sticks in my
[48:42.680 --> 48:47.040]  craw about she said his accent and one guy was not even from Mexico she knows
[48:47.040 --> 48:51.120]  the different accents she said it was it sounded like Central American she could
[48:51.120 --> 48:55.000]  barely understand it she speaks like Castilian because she lived in Madrid for
[48:55.000 --> 49:00.040]  four years she could understand the text max but she says it's got some of its
[49:00.040 --> 49:03.840]  own words kind of like American English is different from English English
[49:03.840 --> 49:11.160]  but she had to listen to it a couple times but it appears he's not even
[49:11.160 --> 49:16.640]  Mexican I mean it's some guy from thousands of miles away saying arrest me
[49:16.640 --> 49:21.240]  and I'm a racist here in my country telling me I don't have a First
[49:21.240 --> 49:28.040]  Amendment it's disgusting I mean you criticize the government in Mexico
[49:28.040 --> 49:31.720]  they'll come beat you up or arrest you or kill you same thing in Guatemala and
[49:31.720 --> 49:35.440]  other places hey how about how about if you think it's inappropriate how about
[49:35.440 --> 49:40.000]  you go back to Guatemala or wherever it is you're from how's that sound pal
[49:40.000 --> 49:43.480]  because I'll welcome you here in open arms if you just stand up for America
[49:43.480 --> 49:46.800]  but see that's why I don't like the fact that the country's got 30 million
[49:46.800 --> 49:50.680]  illegals most of them making up the military now is because I understand
[49:50.680 --> 49:55.360]  what's going on and I understand you're killing our culture our culture in black
[49:55.360 --> 50:01.080]  or white or Hispanic our culture is the Bill of Rights you can shove it excuse

[50:06.200 --> 50:15.600]  you understand me you know I defend the LaRica conquistus right to go around
[50:15.600 --> 50:20.400]  with their signs saying bring down America take down America and I got a
[50:20.400 --> 50:25.560]  mini film called Battle for the Republic that's an extra 15 minute 16 minute
[50:25.560 --> 50:30.440]  extra in in-game blueprint for global enslavement and it shows police at a guy
[50:30.440 --> 50:33.480]  where there's tens of thousands of illegals protesting for open borders in
[50:33.480 --> 50:38.600]  Seattle the cops come over to a guy peacefully protesting against it telling
[50:38.600 --> 50:42.600]  to stop protesting he says no they slam his head in the ground bust his whole
[50:42.600 --> 50:49.200]  forehead open and then laugh and let the illegals celebrate over his body let me

[54:57.240 --> 55:03.320]  division of public relations but he's there when the media is there and he
[55:03.320 --> 55:06.520]  told me years ago when I was hanging out with his brother who also works in
[55:06.520 --> 55:14.680]  another local TV station that he'll sit there and watch him and they'll
[55:14.680 --> 55:19.680]  interview like 30 40 50 people about the checkpoints and take your shoes off or
[55:19.680 --> 55:23.680]  you can't have a water bottle and every person will say it's horrible it's
[55:23.680 --> 55:27.600]  stupid it's a police state they're using this to train us to be slaves I don't
[55:27.600 --> 55:32.400]  like it and then one old lady he said 30 plus in as he has to stand there behind
[55:32.400 --> 55:37.640]  the TV crew this case it was news 8 so I think it's just great to keep us safe I
[55:37.640 --> 55:41.680]  just love it and he knew they were gonna turn the camera off then and he knew
[55:41.680 --> 55:45.280]  that would be on the news and so we were all standing around at the TV station
[55:45.280 --> 55:48.200]  he's going wait I'm waiting for this to come on watch watch as you know they're
[55:48.200 --> 55:51.880]  visiting his brother he goes here it goes here it goes yes it's her it's her
[55:51.880 --> 55:55.920]  and he was new when the newscast was coming on they told him it was also his

[56:20.440 --> 56:29.440]  Florida town I bet for every one person they found against the Obama posters they
[56:29.440 --> 56:33.760]  had 10 against it because it was old folks and they like to be on average
[56:33.760 --> 56:39.800]  conform and don't be disrespectful the president so I'd imagine it wasn't 30
[56:39.800 --> 56:46.320]  or 40 they had to talk to it was probably 10 or 15 I found a few people that is how
[56:46.320 --> 56:53.240]  they rig it when you're watching the news you're seeing a rigged situation and I

[1:02:09.640 --> 1:02:13.240]  the Southern Prairie Law Center but then we're gonna get into what oath keepers
[1:02:13.240 --> 1:02:19.400]  is doing because we know we now have the military saying they don't want 20,000
[1:02:19.400 --> 1:02:24.080]  Homeland Security troops they want 400,000 on the streets of America this
[1:02:24.080 --> 1:02:28.720]  is huge news it is so important it ties into congressman saying they want to

[1:02:56.880 --> 1:02:59.600]  miss that but here are some of the headlines the Pentagon wants the
[1:02:59.600 --> 1:03:06.760]  authority to post almost 400,000 military personnel in the United States and
[1:03:06.760 --> 1:03:12.120]  we're gonna get the writer of that article on next week if we can the
[1:03:12.120 --> 1:03:15.760]  Pentagon has approached Congress to grant the Secretary of Defense the
[1:03:15.760 --> 1:03:19.280]  authority to post almost 400,000 military personnel throughout the United
[1:03:19.280 --> 1:03:24.720]  States folks this is off the charts huge I'm almost ashamed I just covered the
[1:03:24.720 --> 1:03:29.840]  Obama poster in the last 30 minutes but that's all part of this if we don't have
[1:03:29.840 --> 1:03:33.720]  the power you don't know the power folks if they actually go with martial law and
[1:03:33.720 --> 1:03:37.960]  you make up handmade signs on your color copier or your copier and put them out
[1:03:37.960 --> 1:03:43.040]  under a tyranny speaking out against it has hundreds of times the effect it does
[1:03:43.040 --> 1:03:48.240]  when you're living in liberty you understand that we all the tyranny is
[1:03:48.240 --> 1:03:54.440]  coming out in the open now we've been vindicated on every issue that's why I
[1:03:54.440 --> 1:03:57.680]  want to encourage other talk show hosts and other webmasters to not get involved

[1:08:22.160 --> 1:08:28.520]  phones up at the bottom of the hour to talk about governors congressmen in the
[1:08:28.520 --> 1:08:36.240]  mainstream news saying that Obama may use the flu outbreak as a pretext for
[1:08:36.240 --> 1:08:39.800]  martial law then we have Homeland Security and the Secretary of Defense
[1:08:39.800 --> 1:08:44.600]  have now approached Congress and said they want to put 400,000 regular army on
[1:08:44.600 --> 1:08:52.840]  the streets of America this is all off the charts serious meanwhile two Spanish
[1:08:52.840 --> 1:08:58.680]  TV stations including national are calling for my arrest for racism for
[1:08:58.680 --> 1:09:03.560]  putting up telling people to put up posters in legal areas I always thought
[1:09:03.560 --> 1:09:06.560]  light poles where everybody else does Obama told us people put them on stop
[1:09:06.560 --> 1:09:11.520]  signs in the Washington Post posters that made him look in a good light we
[1:09:11.520 --> 1:09:15.040]  said put it up under your local laws in legal areas they're calling for my arrest
[1:09:15.040 --> 1:09:19.240]  I have the Orlando news here saying they're trying to arrest people trying to
[1:09:19.240 --> 1:09:25.640]  get indictments I mean America's going to hell in a handbasket here ladies and
[1:09:25.640 --> 1:09:31.800]  gentlemen you're not even supposed to be able to put up a sign or wear a t-shirt
[1:09:31.800 --> 1:09:36.400]  and they're saying they need to be arrested for racism and a hate crime and
[1:09:36.400 --> 1:09:42.120]  now they're saying if you use the word socialist it's a hate crime that's what
[1:09:42.120 --> 1:09:45.800]  the hate crime bill that passed the House it is now in the Senate says that if you
[1:09:45.800 --> 1:09:49.560]  hurt someone's feelings you're arrested and put in prison not even if a crime is
[1:09:49.560 --> 1:09:55.280]  committed hurting feelings well you know what we're selling the t-shirt that says
[1:09:55.280 --> 1:09:59.120]  socialism on it we sell one that says fascism on it we sell one that says
[1:09:59.120 --> 1:10:04.400]  info wars.com on it one that says New World Order the mainstream media is
[1:10:04.400 --> 1:10:10.600]  giving us credit saying that we started that the entire Obama Joker thing well
[1:10:10.600 --> 1:10:15.720]  number one I'd be proud if I'd started this a month ago in LA I didn't two weeks
[1:10:15.720 --> 1:10:19.960]  ago when they said since or whoever's doing this they need to be arrested
[1:10:19.960 --> 1:10:24.960]  their criminals their racist I said no it's saying he's a criminal and people
[1:10:24.960 --> 1:10:32.400]  did this to Bush and so people need to post more of these in legal and lawful
[1:10:32.400 --> 1:10:37.400]  places in the commons area under common law you see the posters all over
[1:10:37.400 --> 1:10:42.440]  downtown or you see 20 posters on a pole you can put a poster up and if they come
[1:10:42.440 --> 1:10:46.200]  selectively enforced against you that's a big civil rights violation it's just
[1:10:46.200 --> 1:10:52.400]  flat wrong man it's it's hypocrisy and people are seeing through this 90 plus
[1:10:52.400 --> 1:10:55.600]  percent of the post and all these newspaper articles all these TV stories
[1:10:55.600 --> 1:10:59.600]  go read them for yourself we have them linked on info wars.com I mean there's
[1:10:59.600 --> 1:11:05.240]  probably 10 15 20 post saying how ridiculous the hypocrisy is and way to
[1:11:05.240 --> 1:11:09.680]  go putting the posters up now I am seeing people post videos on YouTube where
[1:11:09.680 --> 1:11:14.320]  since the cops started threatening people and saying this is wrong they're
[1:11:14.320 --> 1:11:18.240]  actually going to post offices and going to police stations and putting them on
[1:11:18.240 --> 1:11:22.280]  them don't do that have your first amendment put it where other people put
[1:11:22.280 --> 1:11:27.240]  posters put it in the downtown areas put it on bulletin boards give them to
[1:11:27.240 --> 1:11:34.560]  people but I I mean that's what our founding fathers actually did go and
[1:11:34.560 --> 1:11:38.240]  put stuff on redcoat police stations they actually did do stuff like that they
[1:11:38.240 --> 1:11:42.520]  do stuff like burn images of the redcoats you know out front the police
[1:11:42.520 --> 1:11:50.240]  station and then if the redcoats beat somebody up they'd stop the redcoats on
[1:11:50.240 --> 1:11:53.920]  the road and beat them up I'm not calling for any of that that's evil that's
[1:11:53.920 --> 1:11:58.000]  founding father type stuff and I think someone's sarcastic but but but seriously
[1:11:58.000 --> 1:12:01.360]  I don't want that to happen because the establishment wants violence to break
[1:12:01.360 --> 1:12:09.400]  out now enough said about that we've now put up a t-shirt these are in these are
[1:12:09.400 --> 1:12:14.120]  selling we have these in stock we're now manufacturing today we have a three-day
[1:12:14.120 --> 1:12:19.000]  turnaround so today Saturday and then Monday by Tuesday we'll have these t-shirts
[1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:27.720]  we've made a bush fascist to show that it is nonpartisan and that that were
[1:12:27.720 --> 1:12:31.160]  equal opportunity offenders but under the First Amendment if we just want to
[1:12:31.160 --> 1:12:36.040]  criticize Obama that's our right as well and so here is the poster and
[1:12:36.040 --> 1:12:40.720]  everybody can get this t-shirt it says info wars.com on the back but all the
[1:12:40.720 --> 1:12:45.240]  Obama ones are available at info wars.com and get them all you can Lord knows
[1:12:45.240 --> 1:12:49.440]  they may just go ahead and make all this illegal and I'm not joking about that so
[1:12:49.440 --> 1:12:53.040]  I want to get Stuart Rhodes take on that coming up but not yet we're gonna open
[1:12:53.040 --> 1:13:00.120]  the phones up to at 1-800-259-9231 I know some stations just joined us in the
[1:13:00.120 --> 1:13:03.400]  second hour that's why I'm recapping some top stories the progressive
[1:13:03.400 --> 1:13:06.840]  newspaper is reporting magazine is reporting the Pentagon wants the
[1:13:06.840 --> 1:13:11.280]  authority to boost four hundred thousand military personnel in the US this is
[1:13:11.280 --> 1:13:15.520]  directly from the congressional record and violation of the 1878 positive
[1:13:15.520 --> 1:13:19.720]  commentatus act they've already announced 20,000 troops under brigade
[1:13:19.720 --> 1:13:23.840]  homeland suddenly from California to Tennessee to upstate New York from
[1:13:23.840 --> 1:13:31.400]  disconnecting New York to Arcadia Iowa army regular army National Guard
[1:13:31.400 --> 1:13:37.160]  Marines state guards are running checkpoints searching people actually
[1:13:37.160 --> 1:13:41.960]  arresting people running DWI checkpoints things that are seen as popular to
[1:13:41.960 --> 1:13:46.440]  acclimate the public and they admit this is for domestic operations in the
[1:13:46.440 --> 1:13:50.160]  Homeland Security documents we broke that we got from people inside Homeland
[1:13:50.160 --> 1:13:53.720]  Security in the Department of Defense documents we broke that were later
[1:13:53.720 --> 1:13:57.960]  confirmed mainstream news in the secret clergy response teams and in for guard
[1:13:57.960 --> 1:14:02.280]  documents we broke that were years later confirmed to be real I know they're real
[1:14:02.280 --> 1:14:05.400]  they come directly from sources
[1:14:05.920 --> 1:14:11.240]  Massachusetts deputizes Dennis paramedics pharmacist to administer flu
[1:14:11.240 --> 1:14:16.680]  vaccine Boston Globe for forced inoculations we have another one here
[1:14:16.680 --> 1:14:25.400]  where the congressman is in the news saying that they are preparing for
[1:14:25.400 --> 1:14:33.840]  total martial law and using this as the cover to do that I'm looking for it here
[1:14:33.840 --> 1:14:36.800]  in my stack I'll find it in a moment there's just too many of these to keep
[1:14:36.800 --> 1:14:43.200]  track of German news is reporting there is live cancer viruses in the main
[1:14:43.200 --> 1:14:49.960]  vaccine that's being distributed so that's why we've got Oathkeepers on and
[1:14:49.960 --> 1:14:58.480]  Stuart Rhodes the founder of it with us today we're gonna go to him because
[1:14:58.480 --> 1:15:02.600]  Mr. Rhodes started Oathkeepers he was a high-level aide in Ron Paul's
[1:15:02.600 --> 1:15:07.120]  congressional office in his presidential campaign he's an ex-army
[1:15:07.120 --> 1:15:12.440]  Stuart Rhodes is the founder and director of Oathkeepers military veterans and
[1:15:12.440 --> 1:15:16.160]  peace officers who will honor their oaths defend the Constitution will not
[1:15:16.160 --> 1:15:19.760]  just follow orders will stand up for liberty and will save the Republic so
[1:15:19.760 --> 1:15:24.240]  help us God our motto is not on our watch it's a nonpartisan association of
[1:15:24.240 --> 1:15:27.440]  currently serving military reserves national guard peace officers veterans
[1:15:27.440 --> 1:15:30.320]  who swore an oath to support defend the Constitution against all enemies far
[1:15:30.320 --> 1:15:37.880]  and domestic and he is a Yale law school graduate and was an army officer in well
[1:15:37.880 --> 1:15:50.240]  I mean give us your exact bio Stuart okay now let's get started here you've
[1:15:50.240 --> 1:15:54.200]  heard me throw all this out the main reason I got you on is the Southern
[1:15:54.200 --> 1:16:00.680]  Poverty Law Center has put out a report mixing us in with white supremacist UFO
[1:16:00.680 --> 1:16:07.280]  cults you name it and specifically they attack us together here in this piece go
[1:16:07.280 --> 1:16:12.240]  ahead they do you bet yeah they they got they quote they quote our interview in
[1:16:12.240 --> 1:16:17.720]  fact where they say that Roach Tulk is frisky minded radio hosts Alex Jones
[1:16:17.720 --> 1:16:21.520]  imaginably focused on the police the military came over for the new world
[1:16:21.520 --> 1:16:24.280]  order and I want to thank them for pulling that quote that I forgot about
[1:16:24.280 --> 1:16:28.240]  that I think it's a pretty good flow so you know but now they're doing the same
[1:16:28.240 --> 1:16:31.520]  thing they've done throughout throughout the last few decades anybody who gets to
[1:16:31.520 --> 1:16:36.960]  be a threat to the Orthodox zero-corrects plan they will attack and try to
[1:16:36.960 --> 1:16:40.560]  smear and lump them with races and of course what if they tell you that you're
[1:16:40.560 --> 1:16:43.720]  racist because the black president's an officer you must be racist you're both
[1:16:43.720 --> 1:16:49.200]  anything he does or you were completely insane and therefore the government should
[1:16:49.200 --> 1:16:54.160]  monitor you to investigate you should have a secret file on you and then
[1:16:54.160 --> 1:16:57.640]  should go arrest you to the camp you know that's their best approach did you
[1:16:57.640 --> 1:17:01.680]  see the comments in the article where they say that we need to be killed have
[1:17:01.680 --> 1:17:06.720]  you seen that yet no I haven't seen that yet no I have not but I thought I thought
[1:17:06.720 --> 1:17:10.480]  I found an Alan Colm show which was a really horrible interview all he did all
[1:17:10.480 --> 1:17:16.160]  he wanted to do is was accused me of being a sensationalistic and paranoid
[1:17:16.160 --> 1:17:22.560]  but he had comment on his on his own side pretty precious to you know well well
[1:17:22.560 --> 1:17:26.720]  I mean the Louisville newspapers the AP and others are reporting I'm a dig I'm
[1:17:26.720 --> 1:17:33.720]  out and cover I'm coming up as I find them they are Congressman Brown is
[1:17:33.720 --> 1:17:38.160]  saying this is being used for martial law that Congress has been threatened
[1:17:38.160 --> 1:17:42.960]  with martial law we have now the Pentagon publicly saying they want to
[1:17:42.960 --> 1:17:49.160]  deploy 400,000 regular army on the streets of America I mean this is an
[1:17:49.160 --> 1:17:55.160]  occupation rivaling Baghdad about this is I mean this is really happening yeah
[1:17:55.160 --> 1:17:59.600]  well jumping over to the blue idea that that has always been the one thing that
[1:17:59.600 --> 1:18:03.320]  will throw back at us about our 10 orders if they would about a pandemic and so I
[1:18:03.320 --> 1:18:07.760]  can't think of a stronger pretext sort of a new going on in American city for
[1:18:07.760 --> 1:18:11.520]  trying to declare martial law but as you know martial law has no constitutional
[1:18:11.520 --> 1:18:15.080]  basis whatsoever so I get killed sick and tired of hearing all these politicians
[1:18:15.080 --> 1:18:17.680]  throwing around the word martial law they have no idea what they're talking
[1:18:17.680 --> 1:18:21.120]  about martial law is the absolute absolute law it's the will of the
[1:18:21.120 --> 1:18:24.760]  commander on the battlefield and nowhere in our Constitution is there's an escape
[1:18:24.760 --> 1:18:28.640]  clause that says when the weather is bad you can suspend a second amendment like
[1:18:28.640 --> 1:18:32.840]  it is in Katrina or if there's a flu outbreak you can suspend the Constitution
[1:18:32.840 --> 1:18:37.200]  those martial law doesn't exist and so when you look at article 4 section 4
[1:18:37.200 --> 1:18:42.440]  that's your answer right there let's say right there it says that the national
[1:18:42.440 --> 1:18:48.880]  government shall secure to the state a Republican form of government and she'll
[1:18:48.880 --> 1:18:53.600]  protect each of them against invasion and on application of the legislature or
[1:18:53.600 --> 1:18:58.520]  of the executive when the legislature cannot be convened against the domestic
[1:18:58.520 --> 1:19:01.720]  violence so what it's saying there is that you have to have the permission of
[1:19:01.720 --> 1:19:05.440]  the legislature of the state or only if the legislature cannot be convened the
[1:19:05.440 --> 1:19:10.320]  governor of the state and only then can the federal government come into a state
[1:19:10.320 --> 1:19:15.000]  and so that's my first stop when it comes to the constitutionality of any of
[1:19:15.000 --> 1:19:20.040]  these plans that North Tom, FEMA, DHS have if they're backing up those states
[1:19:20.040 --> 1:19:25.400]  don't exist anymore. Well the issue too is they should everything should be set up
[1:19:25.400 --> 1:19:29.520]  around the state responding because the locals can always spend the
[1:19:29.520 --> 1:19:32.840]  money the best and they can also respond the best that's been the way we've
[1:19:32.840 --> 1:19:37.960]  always operated. I mean Congress can't even read its own bills and look at
[1:19:37.960 --> 1:19:42.880]  Katrina how are they gonna respond? No they're gonna use disasters as a pretext
[1:19:42.880 --> 1:19:47.600]  to come in and confiscate guns and loot the the wealthy houses as happened in
[1:19:47.600 --> 1:19:51.920]  Katrina. Stay there Stewart Rhodes with Oathkeepers thousands and thousands of
[1:19:51.920 --> 1:19:55.340]  military and police taking the oath to not violate the Bill of Rights and
[1:19:55.340 --> 1:20:00.080]  Constitution and to upkeep their oath. We'll be right back.

[1:22:59.760 --> 1:23:04.040]  For years doctors and researchers have known that one of the major pathways to
[1:23:04.040 --> 1:23:07.880]  better health is an alkaline diet rich in minerals and antioxidants to keep the
[1:23:07.880 --> 1:23:12.440]  body and proper pH balance. For 15 years people had trusted AlkaZone, the
[1:23:12.440 --> 1:23:16.160]  simplest way of keeping the body and pH balance, getting rid of acidic waste

[1:24:07.800 --> 1:24:12.760]  Stewart Rhodes, he started Oathkeepers. Well in the last year or so and it's
[1:24:12.760 --> 1:24:16.400]  really exploded in size. We'll give you the website before he leaves this in some
[1:24:16.400 --> 1:24:22.640]  of the testimonials but the government is clearly out of line. It's
[1:24:22.640 --> 1:24:25.760]  violating the Bill of Rights and Constitution. It's run by foreign offshore
[1:24:25.760 --> 1:24:32.040]  banks. They've stolen almost $24 trillion the last 10 months. Obama has
[1:24:32.040 --> 1:24:38.360]  proven he's a liar on every front and then magically they put out DHS reports
[1:24:38.360 --> 1:24:46.320]  saying that all these evil American gun owners are about to attack the
[1:24:46.320 --> 1:24:52.120]  president and right on cue the Southern Property Law Center comes out with a
[1:24:52.120 --> 1:24:57.040]  report demonizing all these good people mixing us in with clearly bad folks and
[1:24:57.040 --> 1:25:03.520]  then now ABC News is doing it and I saw this before Oklahoma City. So before the
[1:25:03.520 --> 1:25:07.840]  Fed stage terror attacks so that they can be the victims and clamp down on
[1:25:07.840 --> 1:25:12.840]  freedom, they do this. This is the preparatory phase. Stewart, do you smell
[1:25:12.840 --> 1:25:18.640]  a false flag in the wind? I think we're heading to the territory where they
[1:25:18.640 --> 1:25:23.120]  could use a pretext such as the flu itself. This appears to be what they're
[1:25:23.120 --> 1:25:26.680]  doing is setting up all the infrastructure and all the planning and
[1:25:26.680 --> 1:25:31.120]  all the rhetoric so that all you have to do is click the button, click the switch,
[1:25:31.120 --> 1:25:35.560]  the flu pops up and the next thing you know that they've imposed martial law.
[1:25:35.560 --> 1:25:38.320]  I want to go back a second when we're talking about a minute ago you're right
[1:25:38.320 --> 1:25:42.920]  about you know the first line is as I said it should be that the state
[1:25:42.920 --> 1:25:46.080]  should have to give permission but then you look at article one section eight
[1:25:46.080 --> 1:25:50.400]  also says that Congress has the power to call forth the militia to execute the
[1:25:50.400 --> 1:25:54.440]  law of the union, the president's direction, the rebel invasion. It's not just a
[1:25:54.440 --> 1:25:59.240]  good idea for the state to be in charge but the founders have the answer. The
[1:25:59.240 --> 1:26:02.440]  answer to the question of who should guard the guardians was that we are
[1:26:02.440 --> 1:26:07.080]  so people would be the guardians of the militia. And then your legislature and
[1:26:07.080 --> 1:26:11.080]  then your legislature that you've elected is in charge so when you see
[1:26:11.080 --> 1:26:16.240]  troops coming down the street they are from your town, your city, you know
[1:26:16.240 --> 1:26:19.880]  their daddy, you know their mama or you might even be their granddaddy and the
[1:26:19.880 --> 1:26:24.120]  legislature commanding them, the governor commanding them, you voted for
[1:26:24.120 --> 1:26:31.240]  them. That is the people ruling. And only you can only have outside militia
[1:26:31.240 --> 1:26:35.680]  somewhere else if that legislature in your state, your governor, invite them in.
[1:26:35.680 --> 1:26:40.360]  Okay and nothing there is contemplating standing army doing anything inside the
[1:26:40.360 --> 1:26:46.000]  United States. It's supposed to be the militia. So standing army defends the
[1:26:46.000 --> 1:26:50.200]  nation's borders and has a navy to defend but it doesn't have any action
[1:26:50.200 --> 1:26:53.080]  inside. Have you seen the editorial cartoon of the United States? It says
[1:26:53.080 --> 1:26:57.400]  Homeland Security with all the cannons swung in pointing inside the country.
[1:26:57.400 --> 1:27:01.280]  And that's what's happening. Everything that Bush created is now being turned
[1:27:01.280 --> 1:27:06.440]  inward. All that infrastructure. And so we are so far from our, you know, the
[1:27:06.440 --> 1:27:09.720]  original intention of the founders. Forget about the POTK commentator act. That's
[1:27:09.720 --> 1:27:14.200]  only a statue. Look at the design of the constitution itself. We're wildly
[1:27:14.200 --> 1:27:18.280]  beyond what they intended. They wanted the militia of the state to be the
[1:27:18.280 --> 1:27:23.240]  internal security force. That'd be us. How are we going to theorize ourselves? You can't.
[1:27:23.240 --> 1:27:28.720]  Now, with their insight. Now, Stewart Obama and his controllers in their slick
[1:27:28.720 --> 1:27:34.520]  lies, they demonize the constitutional militia but then they want a federal or
[1:27:34.520 --> 1:27:43.320]  Stalinistic or Mao-like federal Gestapo. They want a clone but a evil doppelganger.
[1:27:43.320 --> 1:27:47.440]  They want a twisted militia that's a federal militia and they go, well, that's
[1:27:47.440 --> 1:27:50.760]  in the Constitution. So they try to have it both ways. They demonize a real
[1:27:50.760 --> 1:27:54.520]  militia but then they have their counterfeit federal militia. Can you
[1:27:54.520 --> 1:27:58.680]  explain to people from the Constitution the difference? Well, sure. As it says in the
[1:27:58.680 --> 1:28:04.480]  second itself, a well-regulated militia is necessary to secure a free state. The
[1:28:04.480 --> 1:28:08.640]  militias are from the states, not from the national government. That's not a
[1:28:08.640 --> 1:28:12.360]  militia. When the national government hires someone to do anything, they are
[1:28:12.360 --> 1:28:16.320]  now part of a national government and not part of the state structure. And so
[1:28:16.320 --> 1:28:20.480]  it's entirely opposite, as you said. It's like the evil plan of a militia.
[1:28:20.480 --> 1:28:26.960]  It's more like the brown shirts or like the Gestapo or the Stasi. Exactly. The answer to the Stasi,
[1:28:26.960 --> 1:28:31.760]  the answer to the Stasi, are the brown shirts. And I hope that the Southern
[1:28:31.760 --> 1:28:34.960]  Property Law Center gets this quote. We are the opposite of the brown shirts or
[1:28:34.960 --> 1:28:39.640]  the male brigades, the youth brigades. This is the real people's army, not their
[1:28:39.640 --> 1:28:47.000]  wicked counterfeit. Go ahead. That's right. You know, they're trying to create a new
[1:28:47.000 --> 1:28:51.280]  version. You know, they're adopting the old forms. This is what happens. They'll
[1:28:51.280 --> 1:28:55.040]  adopt the old forms and they'll twist them. And it's something that this is done
[1:28:55.040 --> 1:28:58.320]  throughout history. And if every oppressed regime always takes the law and
[1:28:58.320 --> 1:29:03.160]  turns it into a weapon, and they'll adopt the forms and bastardize them. Oral
[1:29:03.160 --> 1:29:07.440]  warned us about this many years ago. So it should be a surprise. But we have to be
[1:29:07.440 --> 1:29:11.760]  on guard. And the first line is your state sovereignty. You have to have, in fact,
[1:29:11.760 --> 1:29:15.680]  this is what needs to happen. State legislators need to convene special
[1:29:15.680 --> 1:29:20.880]  sessions to discuss and to come to conclusions and pass resolutions about
[1:29:20.880 --> 1:29:26.040]  the Queen's Authority of Northcom and FEMA and DHS to come into their state
[1:29:26.040 --> 1:29:32.000]  during a pandemic. Stir. We got a break. Let's come back and talk about that and
[1:29:32.000 --> 1:29:35.320]  then get into the First Amendment overall. But yes, we now have the
[1:29:35.320 --> 1:29:39.800]  Governor's Association sending a letter to the White House and the Pentagon
[1:29:39.800 --> 1:29:44.240]  saying, you're going to put troops on the streets. And the Army's answer is,
[1:29:44.240 --> 1:29:50.560]  yeah, it was 20,000 last year. Now it's 400,000. Will it be a million next year?
[1:29:50.560 --> 1:29:57.800]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:29:57.800 --> 1:30:04.520]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar
[1:30:04.520 --> 1:30:08.120]  power generator this summer. Number one, new climate legislation could easily
[1:30:08.120 --> 1:30:12.280]  double or triple your electric bill. Number two, our new energies are, wants to
[1:30:12.280 --> 1:30:16.240]  control how much power your electric company allows you to have. It's true.
[1:30:16.240 --> 1:30:20.360]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[1:30:20.360 --> 1:30:24.480]  coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously
[1:30:24.480 --> 1:30:27.920]  overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead. Number four,
[1:30:27.920 --> 1:30:31.440]  the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again. Every year,
[1:30:31.440 --> 1:30:35.120]  thousands of families lose their power from weather related outages. Number five,
[1:30:35.120 --> 1:30:39.120]  a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[1:30:39.120 --> 1:30:42.760]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions
[1:30:42.760 --> 1:30:46.680]  from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours. You can get more information at

[1:31:04.240 --> 1:31:08.480]  going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition
[1:31:08.480 --> 1:31:13.000]  do you want? My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the
[1:31:13.000 --> 1:31:17.320]  lives of your loved ones. Food is your only ammunition. How much do you want?
[1:31:17.320 --> 1:31:21.840]  When do you want it? Now or after the battle starts? When will you need it? Can
[1:31:21.840 --> 1:31:25.680]  you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it make
[1:31:25.680 --> 1:31:29.400]  your children sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will
[1:31:29.400 --> 1:31:33.080]  you go to the gathering center and be immunized? You wipe out all these
[1:31:33.080 --> 1:31:37.640]  problems if you have a good food supply. Food is your ammunition to fight for
[1:31:37.640 --> 1:31:42.120]  your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't know. How much do you
[1:31:42.120 --> 1:31:46.720]  want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones. I want all of you good guys to live to fight
[1:31:46.720 --> 1:31:53.400]  another day. Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at

[1:32:01.000 --> 1:32:05.040]  Thomas Jefferson once said, when the people fear their government, there is
[1:32:05.040 --> 1:32:09.920]  tyranny. When the government fears the people, there is liberty. Our God given
[1:32:09.920 --> 1:32:13.680]  right to life and liberty, and the right to determine what is best for our lives
[1:32:13.680 --> 1:32:18.080]  and our family's health, are in jeopardy. If we the people do not diligently
[1:32:18.080 --> 1:32:22.800]  assert these rights, they may be taken away and lost forever. Utopia Silver is
[1:32:22.800 --> 1:32:26.680]  known for fighting for health freedom, and we will not meekly allow ourselves to
[1:32:26.680 --> 1:32:31.080]  be led as lambs to the slaughter, sitting passively by, and accepting the chains of
[1:32:31.080 --> 1:32:35.400]  slavery that are being placed on America is not an option. Please stand with

[1:33:21.600 --> 1:33:29.080]  The globalists have a couple things going for them. They got the central
[1:33:29.080 --> 1:33:32.800]  government, they got the unlimited power of the central banks to issue fiat,
[1:33:32.800 --> 1:33:42.800]  made-up currency, and their plan is so diabolical, so wicked, so corrupt, it's
[1:33:42.800 --> 1:33:50.920]  like wilder than a James Bond evil villain plot. I mean the movie Moonraker
[1:33:50.920 --> 1:33:54.760]  about a plan to set up a world government and kill everybody, you know, they got
[1:33:54.760 --> 1:34:00.240]  the plots for that from real government documents like EcoScience. Fleming, the
[1:34:00.240 --> 1:34:06.400]  work for the MI6 that wrote the books, admitted that, and he did write Moonraker
[1:34:06.400 --> 1:34:10.840]  under another name, but I forget the exact name of it. It wasn't Moonraker, but
[1:34:10.840 --> 1:34:20.800]  the point is that they've got that going for them, but once people find out, this
[1:34:20.800 --> 1:34:24.320]  is really true. I mean, when I got up on air and go, here's the army purchase
[1:34:24.320 --> 1:34:30.320]  orders for FEMA camps. Here's the army hiring people for domestic internment
[1:34:30.320 --> 1:34:36.320]  resettlement programs. You know, here's the actual code on it. When I show you
[1:34:36.320 --> 1:34:41.760]  mainstream news articles, this is out of the hill. Now, big major newspaper in
[1:34:41.760 --> 1:34:48.320]  D.C., and it says, governors oppose DOD emergency powers, and they sent a letter
[1:34:48.320 --> 1:34:51.480]  to the heads of the governor association saying, what is this? You can't
[1:34:51.480 --> 1:34:55.800]  federalize the states and put troops on the streets. They were responding to what
[1:34:55.800 --> 1:35:02.800]  now has come out in the news, and that is these reports out of the AP and the
[1:35:02.800 --> 1:35:09.200]  progressive governors oppose DOD emergency powers. And then that other
[1:35:09.200 --> 1:35:15.920]  headline I was mentioning earlier, the Pentagon wants authority to post almost
[1:35:15.920 --> 1:35:21.080]  400,000 military personnel in U.S. And then I've got articles here where they're
[1:35:21.080 --> 1:35:25.600]  training to take over the cities and admitting that they're going to do it.
[1:35:25.600 --> 1:35:30.800]  In fact, I had that here in my stack. National Guard takes over school and
[1:35:30.800 --> 1:35:36.000]  swine flu vaccine riot drill. And then I can go back a few years and pull up
[1:35:36.000 --> 1:35:41.040]  stuff like the Pensacola News Journal, where the Marines unannounced take over
[1:35:41.040 --> 1:35:45.200]  the middle school point guns at the kids heads. The kids think it's real, and the
[1:35:45.200 --> 1:35:49.920]  Marines say, oh, the president wants you to know what martial law is like. That was
[1:35:49.920 --> 1:35:56.320]  in the newspaper. Folks, this is a real program going on. Stuart Rhodes, with all
[1:35:56.320 --> 1:36:00.760]  of this backdrop happening, and then we've got the Southern Primary Law Center
[1:36:00.760 --> 1:36:05.760]  coming out and viciously attacking you and I and others nationally. I mean, this
[1:36:05.760 --> 1:36:10.200]  report is being one of the top news stories the last three days on every
[1:36:10.200 --> 1:36:16.840]  major newscast. Does that creep you out, but at the same time make you proud that
[1:36:16.840 --> 1:36:20.360]  you're actually having an effect to know that over and over again, myself
[1:36:20.360 --> 1:36:26.320]  especially, get singled out as this enemy. I mean, the full government focus
[1:36:26.320 --> 1:36:32.480]  is on us and trying to demonize these town halls. That's right. I mean, here's the
[1:36:32.480 --> 1:36:35.400]  bottom line. This is why I found a goalkeeper in the first place. The head is
[1:36:35.400 --> 1:36:39.680]  rotten. We have to focus from the bottom up, from the kind of level on up in our
[1:36:39.680 --> 1:36:43.120]  state legislatures, but then we might run out of time, and that's why I found
[1:36:43.120 --> 1:36:48.560]  a goalkeeper to be sure that the best we can make sure that the troops
[1:36:48.560 --> 1:36:52.160]  will not follow the orders, and sure that threatens whatever they have intended
[1:36:52.160 --> 1:36:55.800]  for us. I mean, what could be wrong with us reaffirming our oath unless they have
[1:36:55.800 --> 1:37:00.720]  bad plans, but they have attention to the issue orders that we would not want
[1:37:00.720 --> 1:37:04.200]  to follow because it's unconstitutional. And so I think that the more they
[1:37:04.200 --> 1:37:08.120]  attack me, the more I know I'm doing what's right. That's why I look at it.
[1:37:08.120 --> 1:37:13.160]  Well, you just made a great point. When we've got the government documents
[1:37:13.160 --> 1:37:16.960]  attacking us and attacking Ron Paul and attacking libertarians and attacking
[1:37:16.960 --> 1:37:22.760]  returning veterans and gun owners, that is absolute proof that they are bad and
[1:37:22.760 --> 1:37:29.240]  that our analysis of their system was correct and that my only apology is, Mr.
[1:37:29.240 --> 1:37:35.680]  Rhodes, is that as bad as I said it was, I haven't told the audience and fully
[1:37:35.680 --> 1:37:40.720]  grasped myself just how real this is. I mean, intellectually knowing something
[1:37:40.720 --> 1:37:46.520]  is happening, intellectually knowing it hurts to be in a car wreck and, you know,
[1:37:46.520 --> 1:37:50.560]  flip your car is one thing, but actually being in the car, breaking your ribs,
[1:37:50.560 --> 1:37:54.720]  knocking your head out, you know, the window, getting 20 stitches is another
[1:37:54.720 --> 1:37:59.760]  thing. You know, I mean, intellectually, I know getting the flu doesn't feel good,
[1:37:59.760 --> 1:38:02.840]  but when you're actually vomiting your guts out, it's a different thing. Can you,
[1:38:02.840 --> 1:38:05.840]  can you comment on that? I mean, to actually see this happening.
[1:38:05.840 --> 1:38:13.000]  Well, absolutely. Look back at H.R. 1955, the Jane Harman proposal of the radical
[1:38:13.000 --> 1:38:17.120]  racialization and homegrown terrorist prevention act where they wanted to set up,
[1:38:17.120 --> 1:38:21.160]  you know, get the center of excellence, study people and get secret reports to
[1:38:21.160 --> 1:38:26.760]  Congress. Remember that? And she introduced that on April 19, 2007, because even back then,
[1:38:26.760 --> 1:38:32.040]  her real target was domestic enemies of a... Yeah, for those that don't know, that's like a
[1:38:32.040 --> 1:38:36.120]  police code. When they say April 19th, that's when the, that's when the war
[1:38:36.120 --> 1:38:39.680]  started. Explain that to people. Oh, you bet. I mean, we stood in the green in
[1:38:39.680 --> 1:38:43.520]  Lexington, April 19th, this, this, uh, this last April to commemorate, you know,
[1:38:43.520 --> 1:38:48.080]  as all kinds of citizens do, to celebrate our heritage and also to reaffirm our oath,
[1:38:48.080 --> 1:38:50.960]  but according to the Southern probably law center, that's kind of a sinister
[1:38:50.960 --> 1:38:55.440]  indication that we are, that we are extremists because supposedly April 19th
[1:38:55.440 --> 1:39:00.320]  is, is, is the equivalent to celebrating Oklahoma City's, uh, the blowing up of
[1:39:00.320 --> 1:39:03.880]  Oklahoma City building. So, you know, in their mind that if you do anything
[1:39:03.880 --> 1:39:08.800]  April 19th, it makes you an extremist, not an American. Well, the feds, the globalists
[1:39:08.800 --> 1:39:12.800]  hate America. That's why they burned Waco on April 19th and used special forces
[1:39:12.800 --> 1:39:16.160]  against those children. We have the congressional documents with Delta force
[1:39:16.160 --> 1:39:21.440]  there and that's why they bombed Oklahoma City on April 19th, was to take that day
[1:39:21.440 --> 1:39:26.720]  away from us. They want to take our sacred days and expropriate them and turn it
[1:39:26.720 --> 1:39:32.240]  into a day of victimization for their red coat system. Well, they want to demonize
[1:39:32.240 --> 1:39:35.760]  it. They want to erase our own history. Um, so here's what's happening. It's what
[1:39:35.760 --> 1:39:39.920]  she wanted to do is being done anyway, even though the bill didn't pass. And
[1:39:39.920 --> 1:39:44.320]  Southern probably law center is just another facet of that. They are acting
[1:39:44.320 --> 1:39:50.800]  as the Gestapo secret police wing to go and label people. Um, instead of having
[1:39:50.800 --> 1:39:55.840]  the, the FBI do it directly, they do it for them. And then the DHS feeds off of
[1:39:55.840 --> 1:39:59.440]  their fake little reports and comes up with their own report. And then it got,
[1:39:59.440 --> 1:40:03.120]  then it got to the public law center, then fighting the DHS report, they helped
[1:40:03.120 --> 1:40:06.640]  fight. I mean, this is, this is just sort of like, like a puppeteer or two puppets
[1:40:06.640 --> 1:40:10.880]  in a fan. All the same puppet master. So, and, and, and the whole point is to
[1:40:10.880 --> 1:40:14.960]  demonize, marginalize, make someone a target, make them outside of the
[1:40:14.960 --> 1:40:18.400]  society's protection. And then they stick the dogs on you. Then they stick the
[1:40:18.400 --> 1:40:22.080]  military on you if they can, or they stick the police on you at least.
[1:40:22.080 --> 1:40:25.760]  Well, that's what Hitler did. That's what Lenin did. That's what Mao did first
[1:40:25.760 --> 1:40:30.640]  for four or five years. In every case, they demonize the group. Then they go
[1:40:30.640 --> 1:40:36.080]  after you and, uh, you know, we got the secret army document that regular army
[1:40:36.080 --> 1:40:41.120]  is watching us and Ron Paul and that became national news. The good news is
[1:40:41.120 --> 1:40:45.520]  though it's backfiring because the military is going, why am I spying on
[1:40:45.520 --> 1:40:50.720]  Wayne Paul? Why am I spying on Alex Jones? Why am I spying on Ron Paul? Why
[1:40:50.720 --> 1:40:55.600]  am I spying on Stuart Rhodes? Why are we following around some little old lady
[1:40:55.600 --> 1:41:00.880]  that's handing out yard signs to end the Fed? Uh, I mean, I really think the
[1:41:00.880 --> 1:41:05.200]  establishment is trying to do the same thing the bankers funded in Russia and
[1:41:05.200 --> 1:41:08.640]  China and Germany. And I don't see it working.
[1:41:08.640 --> 1:41:12.880]  No, it's not. It's backfiring because they cast it to broad. It becomes absurd. It's like,
[1:41:12.880 --> 1:41:17.040]  well, anybody who disagrees with what's going on, or anybody who
[1:41:17.040 --> 1:41:20.400]  they can categorize as being anywhere on the political right, is now a potential
[1:41:20.400 --> 1:41:24.720]  terrorist. It's ridiculous. Like, the extremist lexicon define an extremist
[1:41:24.720 --> 1:41:28.400]  as being the same as a terrorist, and then it went down a list of all these so-called
[1:41:28.400 --> 1:41:31.600]  extremist groups. So we're all automatically terrorists, or just
[1:41:31.600 --> 1:41:36.560]  different stripes of terrorists. This person's an anti-abortion terrorist.
[1:41:36.560 --> 1:41:40.160]  This person here is an anti-abortion or anti-order,
[1:41:40.160 --> 1:41:43.040]  you know, free-border terrorist. You know, so they could live in different kinds of
[1:41:43.040 --> 1:41:48.640]  terrorists, but they pull all together in one big giant pool of extremists,
[1:41:48.640 --> 1:41:52.400]  which means terrorists. And so it's so broad and so sweeping
[1:41:52.400 --> 1:41:56.080]  that anyone can see through it, you know, ridiculous, it really is, unless they're
[1:41:56.080 --> 1:41:59.200]  a part of the pack. Well, well, Stuart, you also noticed that
[1:41:59.200 --> 1:42:04.160]  everybody they list in that DHS report are people that are following something
[1:42:04.160 --> 1:42:07.520]  that's constitutional. And it happens to be popular.
[1:42:07.520 --> 1:42:11.280]  81% Gallant Poll control the borders, demonized.
[1:42:11.280 --> 1:42:15.520]  Almost 80% say, get rid of restricted gun laws. We're winning that fight.
[1:42:15.520 --> 1:42:19.760]  We're terrorist. Upwards of 70% now are against abortion.
[1:42:19.760 --> 1:42:25.040]  So the majority of us are terrorists. This is an unpopular,
[1:42:25.040 --> 1:42:29.440]  it's like national polls show 92% believe the government killed Kennedy now.
[1:42:29.440 --> 1:42:33.840]  I mean, so 8% is saying 92% of us are nuts or terrorists.
[1:42:33.840 --> 1:42:37.840]  It isn't going to work anymore. I mean, look, the feds might have been able to
[1:42:37.840 --> 1:42:40.960]  get away with blowing up their own federal building in 95.
[1:42:40.960 --> 1:42:44.640]  They might have been able to get away with that now. I want to caution the
[1:42:44.640 --> 1:42:47.760]  black-op operators and the mercenaries and others.
[1:42:47.760 --> 1:42:52.160]  Cheney's been caught for staging terror in the Middle East to blame it on enemies.
[1:42:52.160 --> 1:42:55.280]  It's coming out about black water. You guys aren't going to get away with this
[1:42:55.280 --> 1:42:58.480]  because there's people on the inside that are going to blow the whistle from so
[1:42:58.480 --> 1:43:01.520]  many angles. You're going to get caught. And I really,
[1:43:01.520 --> 1:43:05.920]  Stuart, feel but also intellectually see the momentum has shifted.
[1:43:05.920 --> 1:43:09.920]  Now, for leaders like you and myself, they may imprison us or kill us, but
[1:43:09.920 --> 1:43:14.640]  we're actually fighting for America in the final battle. I mean, in the main
[1:43:14.640 --> 1:43:17.840]  crossroads. So I'm not even worried about it. It's a great honor. I wish I had more
[1:43:17.840 --> 1:43:22.160]  lives to give, but for the people out there, if you simply take action, get the
[1:43:22.160 --> 1:43:26.240]  word out, expose the globalist, I don't see us being able to be defeated.
[1:43:26.240 --> 1:43:29.360]  Even if they blow up federal buildings, even if the feds set off a nuke,
[1:43:29.360 --> 1:43:32.960]  even if they release some deadly flu, Stuart, I've looked at this from every
[1:43:32.960 --> 1:43:38.720]  angle. If the people believe they can win, it's over. We win.
[1:43:38.720 --> 1:43:42.400]  Absolutely. And here's the thing. If you wake up enough of the police military,
[1:43:42.400 --> 1:43:46.160]  as I said in that prior interview, then it's a game over for them.
[1:43:46.160 --> 1:43:49.120]  You can't do these things without the
[1:43:49.120 --> 1:43:53.440]  willing compliance of the troops, of the police.
[1:43:53.440 --> 1:43:56.480]  If they have them on their side, then it's still not over for us.
[1:43:56.480 --> 1:43:59.200]  We can still fight. But certainly it's better for us to have our
[1:43:59.200 --> 1:44:04.960]  brothers and sisters on our side. So we have to make sure we get as many
[1:44:04.960 --> 1:44:08.560]  of them as possible. And that's our mission. And our next big push now is
[1:44:08.560 --> 1:44:12.800]  going to be to put an Oathkeeper packet, including an Oathkeeper's guidebook and
[1:44:12.800 --> 1:44:16.240]  a tab you can put on their uniform. We want to get those out to every single
[1:44:16.240 --> 1:44:18.640]  service member. So we're going to be doing a big money
[1:44:18.640 --> 1:44:21.920]  way between now and November 11th, which is the veteran's day.
[1:44:21.920 --> 1:44:24.960]  And it's going to go into a distinct fund where people can just donate 30 bucks
[1:44:24.960 --> 1:44:28.160]  and it will go right to in the hands of the service member, current
[1:44:28.160 --> 1:44:30.960]  service. Don't know that every time they do that, it's going to end in that
[1:44:30.960 --> 1:44:36.560]  result. And it's oath-keepers.blogspot.com.
[1:44:36.560 --> 1:44:42.640]  We have a new website, oathkeepers.org. Oathkeepers.org. We'll also get that up.
[1:44:42.640 --> 1:44:45.280]  I want to go to some phone calls, Stuart, at the time we have
[1:44:45.280 --> 1:44:49.760]  left for you. But I did want to mention the Joker posters.
[1:44:49.760 --> 1:44:53.280]  These were put up in California. Then Mark Dice had his own contest. So I
[1:44:53.280 --> 1:44:58.320]  copied him. Did a contest. But a few people put these
[1:44:58.320 --> 1:45:01.840]  on post office boxes. Big deal. But they're saying, oh, big federal felony
[1:45:01.840 --> 1:45:05.360]  terrorism. Now they're saying it's an act of terror
[1:45:05.360 --> 1:45:09.360]  and abusive and there's victims. If you even put it up
[1:45:09.360 --> 1:45:13.120]  where other posters are, they're saying the poster itself is racist.
[1:45:13.120 --> 1:45:17.600]  That it's a hate crime to say socialism. I'm not kidding. That's in the news.
[1:45:17.600 --> 1:45:20.960]  And they have people on the news saying, I need to be arrested.
[1:45:20.960 --> 1:45:25.920]  That's content-based discrimination. That's content-based targeting.
[1:45:25.920 --> 1:45:30.320]  The executive set a target in the content. It's not content neutral.
[1:45:30.320 --> 1:45:33.040]  That's unconstitutional. Yeah, because you're a constitutional lawyer. I was
[1:45:33.040 --> 1:45:36.320]  going to ask your opinion. So, I mean, that's the... So, clearly this is
[1:45:36.320 --> 1:45:39.440]  discrimination. Oh, sure. At the ACLU, they'll tell you
[1:45:39.440 --> 1:45:42.720]  the same thing, I hope, is that it's clearly content-based.
[1:45:42.720 --> 1:45:45.600]  I mean, they're doing the same thing, the same thing to everybody else, but
[1:45:45.600 --> 1:45:49.200]  they're a lawyer. No, they're not. So it's based on your content.
[1:45:49.200 --> 1:45:52.880]  That's unconstitutional. I don't care what you're saying. You can have a big,
[1:45:52.880 --> 1:45:57.520]  a clan putting up a swastika. And if they are singled out because of
[1:45:57.520 --> 1:46:01.200]  the content, that's also content-based discrimination. That's why the ACLU
[1:46:01.200 --> 1:46:04.320]  defended the clan's right to march through Scotia, Illinois.
[1:46:04.320 --> 1:46:08.640]  You know, as painful and horrible as that was, it was to protect the
[1:46:08.640 --> 1:46:12.080]  principle if you don't discriminate on content.
[1:46:12.080 --> 1:46:16.320]  Because the minute that the clan, every one of them federal officers, I've been
[1:46:16.320 --> 1:46:20.480]  to these events to protest them, I mean, it's just feds, period.
[1:46:20.480 --> 1:46:23.360]  And it's come out over and over again. It's feds to demonize the patriot
[1:46:23.360 --> 1:46:25.680]  movement. Because they'll get up there and give pro-second
[1:46:25.680 --> 1:46:27.520]  amendment speeches. They'll get up there and give
[1:46:27.520 --> 1:46:31.200]  anti-new world order speeches. All the demonizes and later it comes out their
[1:46:31.200 --> 1:46:35.120]  feds or informants or, you know, the leaders are being paid to do it.
[1:46:35.120 --> 1:46:38.560]  But yeah, you take those big, fat federal agents
[1:46:38.560 --> 1:46:42.960]  right away, you lose your right. And that's why these people
[1:46:42.960 --> 1:46:45.840]  sending me emails saying, I deserve to go to prison.
[1:46:45.840 --> 1:46:50.000]  That just shows they haven't been teaching civics in the schools.
[1:46:50.000 --> 1:46:53.760]  No, they don't understand their own history. I mean, the civil rights movement in the
[1:46:53.760 --> 1:46:57.200]  60s would have gone nowhere. If you could have content-based discrimination,
[1:46:57.200 --> 1:47:00.320]  that's why they, that's why they resorted to peaceful marches, because they have a
[1:47:00.320 --> 1:47:04.240]  constitutional right. The first amendment, sadly,
[1:47:04.240 --> 1:47:07.440]  the other parts of the civil rights aren't strongly protected. But the first
[1:47:07.440 --> 1:47:11.440]  amendment's been pretty strongly protected. It's the most public weapon we have
[1:47:11.440 --> 1:47:15.120]  legally, as far as the level of protection for it. And you can thank
[1:47:15.120 --> 1:47:17.280]  the ACLU for that. It gets some things right.
[1:47:17.280 --> 1:47:20.960]  Well, Stuart, let me ask you this. You were talking to the military, you're talking
[1:47:20.960 --> 1:47:24.160]  to the police, tens of thousands of contacted you, you have huge events,
[1:47:24.160 --> 1:47:30.240]  it's exploding. What is their view on seeing all this classic,
[1:47:30.240 --> 1:47:33.440]  really malice, is the closest thing I would call it,
[1:47:33.440 --> 1:47:37.920]  tyranny manifesting? Are they redoubling their efforts to warn other
[1:47:37.920 --> 1:47:42.640]  military and police? I mean, clearly, if the government organs and
[1:47:42.640 --> 1:47:45.760]  government surrogates like Southern Property Law are coming after you,
[1:47:45.760 --> 1:47:51.600]  they are. But, I mean, what's the sense of the membership?
[1:47:51.600 --> 1:47:54.880]  Yes, it's making them all the more resolved.
[1:47:54.880 --> 1:47:58.560]  And like you said earlier, it makes it clear that we are
[1:47:58.560 --> 1:48:02.400]  in the game now that we'd all have to ready what would be coming.
[1:48:02.400 --> 1:48:05.520]  It's happening to us right now. And so we are hearing back,
[1:48:05.520 --> 1:48:09.120]  active duty, if I can get an active duty guy right now on our blog,
[1:48:09.120 --> 1:48:12.640]  on our site, who are saying, I am making sure I spread this as far and as
[1:48:12.640 --> 1:48:16.320]  fast as possible. We want to help them. We want to put billboards up outside of
[1:48:16.320 --> 1:48:19.760]  bases. We want to make sure we get a care package. My goal is to have a
[1:48:19.760 --> 1:48:23.120]  care package in the hands of 40,000 active duty troops by Christmas.
[1:48:23.120 --> 1:48:26.320]  So that's my goal. And we're starting state networks too.
[1:48:26.320 --> 1:48:30.000]  We now have state chapters with state directors, and our goal is to have an
[1:48:30.000 --> 1:48:33.360]  active oath keeper chapter in every county of the state to make sure the
[1:48:33.360 --> 1:48:36.800]  sheriff is squared away, make sure the police there know who the veterans are,
[1:48:36.800 --> 1:48:39.920]  they all become friends, they all know who they have each other's back.
[1:48:39.920 --> 1:48:42.800]  That's our goal, is to make sure that we've got our county squared away from
[1:48:42.800 --> 1:48:45.600]  the bottom up. And so working as fast as we possibly can.
[1:48:45.600 --> 1:48:49.360]  Oh, and Sheriff Macket, in fact, is speaking of sheriffs, has a response to
[1:48:49.360 --> 1:48:52.400]  something probably law center that he just said. I mean, we just posted it on our
[1:48:52.400 --> 1:48:55.520]  site. So folks want to go to oathkeeper.org, they can read his
[1:48:55.520 --> 1:48:59.520]  well-reasoned response, and also with Lieutenant Commander Gilley, who's an
[1:48:59.520 --> 1:49:03.280]  active duty commander, who was with the plexiglass writing his response,
[1:49:03.280 --> 1:49:07.840]  will post that, as soon as he sends it in. Well good, because
[1:49:07.840 --> 1:49:11.280]  if we give in to this shelling effect, in fact, next Wednesday I'll announce the
[1:49:11.280 --> 1:49:15.600]  winners to the great Obama poster contest. But I'm
[1:49:15.600 --> 1:49:20.720]  going to go ahead and next week announce another contest to keep this going.
[1:49:20.720 --> 1:49:24.720]  Regardless, all of you that put posters up, one, be sure and follow your local
[1:49:24.720 --> 1:49:29.040]  laws, don't give these thugs excuses to selectively enforce on you.
[1:49:29.040 --> 1:49:32.560]  But because they're trying to threaten me, because they're telling me I don't
[1:49:32.560 --> 1:49:35.920]  have a First Amendment, but Obama could be in the Washington Post say,
[1:49:35.920 --> 1:49:40.240]  saying put my posters up on stop signs. He's saying do something illegal, we're
[1:49:40.240 --> 1:49:44.640]  not. But they're saying we're not even though allowed to legally say this.
[1:49:44.640 --> 1:49:50.720]  I'm not giving into this intimidation. They're coming.
[1:49:50.720 --> 1:49:53.120]  Well thank you, Stuart. I want your take on this in a moment. I just wanted to
[1:49:53.120 --> 1:49:56.240]  tell the people if we give in to the intimidation, they win.
[1:49:56.240 --> 1:49:59.760]  They wouldn't be going absolutely crazy over this, though, if it wasn't scaring
[1:49:59.760 --> 1:50:02.800]  them. And just the exercise of people outputting
[1:50:02.800 --> 1:50:05.520]  things up, just the exercise of getting off your
[1:50:05.520 --> 1:50:09.920]  butts, is a literal psychological and spiritual shift.
[1:50:09.920 --> 1:50:14.720]  Stuart Comments. Well, it's like a movie about data. You know, after a while, everyone was
[1:50:14.720 --> 1:50:18.000]  running around spreading these. And whether the state
[1:50:18.000 --> 1:50:21.680]  decrees it okay or not, you should exercise your First Amendment right.
[1:50:21.680 --> 1:50:26.400]  I got an idea for you. How about one of those oath breakers?
[1:50:26.400 --> 1:50:30.480]  Below is below the picture. That's a good idea, oath breaker or
[1:50:30.480 --> 1:50:33.200]  liar. I mean, he's been caught lying about
[1:50:33.200 --> 1:50:37.840]  everything he said he did. Liar. But the response should be to go
[1:50:37.840 --> 1:50:42.160]  out here and do it more. That should be the response.
[1:50:42.160 --> 1:50:45.680]  Well, that's what the listeners are doing. I said listeners, I said be careful and
[1:50:45.680 --> 1:50:49.360]  the listeners are going no, and they're doing it to police stations.
[1:50:49.360 --> 1:50:53.280]  So the spirit of 1776 is alive and well,
[1:50:53.280 --> 1:50:56.320]  and I would caution the police military to think twice
[1:50:56.320 --> 1:51:00.880]  about what side of history they want to be on. Your gut tells you to join us.

[1:53:01.280 --> 1:53:06.640]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[1:53:07.280 --> 1:53:12.240]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would
[1:53:12.240 --> 1:53:17.680]  like to see. The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for
[1:53:17.680 --> 1:53:22.960]  the best interests of the American people. Well, Obama's already fudging. Yeah, fudged since day
[1:53:22.960 --> 1:53:28.400]  one in this election. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists
[1:53:28.400 --> 1:53:35.120]  who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[1:53:37.280 --> 1:53:40.880]  It's not about left to right. It's about a one-world government.
[1:53:40.880 --> 1:53:48.560]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda. Get your copy

[1:53:56.000 --> 1:54:11.120]  The Obama deception. The people strike back.
[1:54:11.120 --> 1:54:27.280]  All right, we're going to keep Stuart five minutes in the next hour as we get to your calls.
[1:54:27.280 --> 1:54:31.840]  Let's talk to Brian in New York. You're on the air with fellow thought criminal.
[1:54:31.840 --> 1:54:35.040]  He dare ask the military and police to keep their oath.
[1:54:35.040 --> 1:54:41.520]  Go ahead, Brian. You're on the air. Okay.
[1:54:42.480 --> 1:54:45.680]  Brian in New York is not there. Let's go to Brian in Jersey.
[1:54:45.680 --> 1:54:51.120]  Go ahead, Brian. You're on the air. Hey, how are you doing? The comment I wanted to make,
[1:54:51.120 --> 1:54:56.080]  actually, was regarding Obama saying to put his signs on stop signs and whatnot. I actually think
[1:54:56.080 --> 1:55:00.640]  that might be a good idea. Imagine if half the street corners in this country had signed us
[1:55:00.640 --> 1:55:07.760]  and said, stop Obama. Yeah, but see, you can put a sign up that shows him as God or looks
[1:55:07.760 --> 1:55:14.640]  like a Stalin with him looking like this one. But the minute you put one up defiling his
[1:55:14.640 --> 1:55:20.720]  godliness, the locals just flip out. The government comes out and lies and says,
[1:55:20.720 --> 1:55:26.080]  everyone in the town hates it. It's racist. Remove it. And that's why the elite wanted him in office
[1:55:26.080 --> 1:55:30.640]  was so they could play the race card. Anytime you disagree with him, it's just,
[1:55:30.640 --> 1:55:34.880]  I think it's blowing up in their face, though. I mean, now you can't say the word socialist.
[1:55:36.560 --> 1:55:40.800]  Let's get a comment on what Brian said from Stewart Rhodes of Oathkeeper Stewart.
[1:55:41.440 --> 1:55:47.760]  Yeah, I mean, it's a tough one to walk there. You want to respect the, you know, the property
[1:55:48.320 --> 1:55:53.520]  and the public safety of your city. But then you also want to have an active department.
[1:55:53.520 --> 1:55:58.320]  So I can't, I can't recommend that they go out and break the law. But let me just say,
[1:55:58.320 --> 1:56:03.120]  you should exercise your personal rights rigorously and fully because Stewart,
[1:56:03.120 --> 1:56:08.160]  why do you think, why do you think I'm getting sent the videos of people saying,
[1:56:08.720 --> 1:56:12.320]  we're just going to put them on police stations now. And I'm telling people don't do it,
[1:56:12.320 --> 1:56:18.400]  but the spirit of 1776 is so strong. I wonder if the police know down the road,
[1:56:18.400 --> 1:56:23.760]  it, if the new order comes in, that it's not going to be street signs.
[1:56:24.320 --> 1:56:27.280]  Well, you shouldn't look at the cops as your enemy. I mean, this is, this is,
[1:56:27.280 --> 1:56:30.880]  this is what they want you to do. Yes, they want you to do. They want that. So I would
[1:56:30.880 --> 1:56:35.440]  recommend not doing that. You put that on Town Hall, City Hall. You know, you put that,
[1:56:35.440 --> 1:56:38.880]  you put that on another Oathbreakers house or something like that. You don't, you don't put
[1:56:38.880 --> 1:56:44.800]  it on the police officer's property. Not for now. For now, give them the benefit of the doubt
[1:56:44.800 --> 1:56:49.360]  that they are going to do what's right and let them see you as their ally, not their opponent.
[1:56:49.360 --> 1:56:52.960]  No, no, I agree. That's why I'm saying that this needs to be done.
[1:56:54.000 --> 1:56:58.000]  But anything else, Brian? I don't know. I'm just saying, just, you know,
[1:56:58.000 --> 1:57:01.920]  do what the president suggested you do. If you even want the names on stop signs,
[1:57:01.920 --> 1:57:05.520]  you know, just imagine what that message would actually say. Stop Obama.
[1:57:05.520 --> 1:57:08.880]  Well, what would happen if they arrest somebody putting it on a stop sign
[1:57:08.880 --> 1:57:12.720]  or maybe below the sign? So it doesn't endanger public safety. And then you get a ticket or
[1:57:12.720 --> 1:57:16.960]  arrested. You can go in with the official letter head of the president, telling his
[1:57:16.960 --> 1:57:20.480]  constituents to do it. Is the court then going to go after Obama?
[1:57:25.520 --> 1:57:25.840]  Go ahead.
[1:57:26.480 --> 1:57:30.640]  I know it's not going to stop the course, but it's going to stop. You know, it'll probably
[1:57:30.640 --> 1:57:34.240]  say, hey, listen to Obama said to do this. So I'm just following the president's orders.
[1:57:34.240 --> 1:57:37.840]  All right, let's talk to John in Missouri. John in Missouri. Make it quick, Placer. Go ahead.
[1:57:37.840 --> 1:57:43.680]  Stuart Alex, it's great to talk to two great American patriots. Keep up the good work. Keep
[1:57:43.680 --> 1:57:49.280]  pressing on. I got one point to make to all patriots out there. If they do press this issue
[1:57:49.280 --> 1:57:55.760]  and push the button that all patriots need to know who the enemy is so that they can be
[1:57:55.760 --> 1:58:01.920]  singled out in the future so they can do their job. Know who the people in the CFR are.
[1:58:02.640 --> 1:58:07.120]  Know who are the people in the high command that have been acting treasonously against our
[1:58:07.120 --> 1:58:15.200]  country so that when you get the opportunity for making a citizen's arrest or a somewhat
[1:58:15.200 --> 1:58:19.120]  different approach, they can know what their true enemy is.
[1:58:20.320 --> 1:58:27.680]  Well, they wanted to attack Iran, but Fox Fallon said no. So there are even some good people
[1:58:27.680 --> 1:58:32.160]  at the higher levels. We'll get Stuart Rhodes takes on that when we get back. Thank you, John.
[1:58:32.160 --> 1:58:37.760]  We'll talk to Ryan, D and Jeff and others. Bob Chapman's coming up on the economy as well.

[1:58:50.480 --> 1:58:54.720]  Hello, friends. This is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[1:58:54.720 --> 1:58:59.920]  Do you really know what's in your tap water? In a recent study conducted by a major environmental
[1:58:59.920 --> 1:59:04.800]  auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal drinking
[1:59:04.800 --> 1:59:09.040]  water. Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune and
[1:59:09.040 --> 1:59:14.320]  developmental system diseases. Now, what are you going to do about it? The Acola Blue atmospheric
[1:59:14.320 --> 1:59:19.200]  water generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.

[2:00:05.360 --> 2:00:12.640]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[2:00:12.640 --> 2:00:21.600]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:23.360 --> 2:00:28.160]  Stuart Rhodes isn't that big issue, what the last caller was bringing up, that the
[2:00:28.160 --> 2:00:33.920]  establishment's playing a very dangerous game. They want to stir up resistance, but only enough
[2:00:33.920 --> 2:00:42.800]  to label it kooky and demonize, peaceful demonstrating, peaceful voting, peaceful litigation. They
[2:00:42.800 --> 2:00:48.240]  want enough of a revolt to crack down, but not a big enough revolt where it's seen as widespread
[2:00:48.240 --> 2:00:54.320]  and then they lose. So I don't want to give them the revolt, the violent revolt, but I don't know
[2:00:54.320 --> 2:01:00.080]  of the establishment knows. I think they do to a certain extent. There really are probably about
[2:01:00.080 --> 2:01:04.560]  a million people that really don't want to live anymore and just want to go after globalists.
[2:01:07.120 --> 2:01:11.040]  You see the White House now apologizing, all these senators apologizing, saying,
[2:01:11.040 --> 2:01:15.360]  okay, we know your mainstream, we know a lot of you are Democrats that don't want the healthcare
[2:01:15.360 --> 2:01:20.960]  and don't want the cap and trade. Okay, we're sorry. Yes. And so there's a total capitulation
[2:01:20.960 --> 2:01:26.000]  happening. I think this may have been them breaking and deciding to not go with a very
[2:01:26.000 --> 2:01:32.560]  hot summer and fall. I'm not saying that's happened, but I think they're starting to realize this is
[2:01:32.560 --> 2:01:36.800]  not going to be as easy as what they did to the Russian people. Well, no, because we're not Russian
[2:01:36.800 --> 2:01:41.920]  peasants. We're not Chinese peasants or Cambodians. This is America. We have a long history of fighting
[2:01:41.920 --> 2:01:46.320]  back against any kind of tyrant. And so, you know, they got their work cut out for them,
[2:01:46.320 --> 2:01:51.120]  but they're still trying to stay in playbook, which demonize, marginalize, and chill speech.
[2:01:51.120 --> 2:01:55.440]  They're threatening you with arrest because they want you to stop speaking out. And that's the
[2:01:55.440 --> 2:01:59.440]  motive that Miranda, I get emails all the time saying, I'm afraid to join other keepers that
[2:01:59.440 --> 2:02:04.400]  want to be on a list. So that's all this DHS stuff. And so they're probably locked in her.
[2:02:04.400 --> 2:02:09.040]  It does work on some people because it shows their speech. But see, I don't see them working
[2:02:09.040 --> 2:02:13.440]  anymore though. More and more people say, I don't care. Look, the answer is, is that they have 20
[2:02:13.440 --> 2:02:19.280]  million people, 100 million on the list. Folks, I am on the top of the list right up there with
[2:02:19.280 --> 2:02:24.560]  Ron Paul. So good. I am at the top of the list. That's why John Hancock said, look,
[2:02:24.560 --> 2:02:28.800]  I'm signing my death warrant. If we don't win this thing, I'm going to sign it big and bold.
[2:02:28.800 --> 2:02:32.720]  So I'm the number one guy they try to come after. That's right. That's why I said,
[2:02:32.720 --> 2:02:38.000]  let's agree. And so the answer is that they have 300 names on that list, but it's all on the list.
[2:02:38.000 --> 2:02:42.000]  And that is the proper response. And that's what I think is going to happen. So folks,
[2:02:42.000 --> 2:02:47.120]  don't let them chill your speech because if you think you're going to be able to just be quietly
[2:02:47.120 --> 2:02:52.400]  the gray man in the mold and sit back and not make waves that you're going to be okay,
[2:02:52.400 --> 2:02:56.720]  you're kidding yourself. Go look back at history. Look at the gulags in Russia.
[2:02:56.720 --> 2:03:00.560]  Half the guys in the gulags are writing Stalin saying, I can understand why I'm here.
[2:03:00.560 --> 2:03:04.640]  There was no mistake. There was no mistake. You're there for a damn good reason. Don't
[2:03:04.640 --> 2:03:08.240]  think being quiet is going to keep you safe. You need to step out in the street right now
[2:03:08.240 --> 2:03:11.520]  and speak up. Use your first amendment before you have to use a second.
[2:03:12.240 --> 2:03:17.200]  Exactly. The only way to beat these people is to stand up to the bullies. And that's what
[2:03:17.200 --> 2:03:22.560]  Alexander Seltzenitzen said to paraphrase, oh, how we burned in the camps that when Stalin would
[2:03:22.560 --> 2:03:27.200]  send out his secret police arresting people every night that we didn't wait for him with our daggers
[2:03:27.200 --> 2:03:33.520]  and our hatchets. And literally folks, you cross over to a point spiritually, mentally,
[2:03:33.520 --> 2:03:39.120]  historically that you're part of a species and liberty and freedom for the human condition
[2:03:39.120 --> 2:03:44.480]  is what matters and not letting control freaks and criminals and backstabbers and parasites run
[2:03:44.480 --> 2:03:50.640]  things. And I look at it this way politically, not not physically, but of need be the Alamo.
[2:03:50.640 --> 2:03:54.560]  You know, Travis knew he was going to die. He said victory and death. He felt good about it.
[2:03:54.560 --> 2:03:58.880]  And it wasn't that he was some madman. This was the chance of a lifetime to stand up to a bunch
[2:03:58.880 --> 2:04:04.800]  of thugs. And he knew that his blood was going to water the tree of liberty. And so I don't know
[2:04:04.800 --> 2:04:10.080]  what people are afraid of out there. This is the real chance to actually fight for the republic
[2:04:10.080 --> 2:04:14.560]  when it's really under attack when they're coming for your family. Stuart, closing comment in the
[2:04:14.560 --> 2:04:20.080]  last 45 seconds. Hey, we're going to die anyway. You know, and like I said, use your voice first.
[2:04:20.080 --> 2:04:23.600]  But hey, I'm not afraid to die. I'm going to die anyway. None of us get out of here alive.
[2:04:23.600 --> 2:04:28.240]  And what counts is that our children are free. That's all we count. So it's time to voice,
[2:04:28.240 --> 2:04:34.560]  use your voice, use the pen as my sort, use your pen, and speak out. And join our keepers,
[2:04:34.560 --> 2:04:39.200]  join our keepers.org. All right, Stuart, as that fundraiser comes up, we're going to get behind
[2:04:39.200 --> 2:04:44.240]  you and our great listeners. That's who is important. I'm just the gateway to these great people
[2:04:44.240 --> 2:04:47.520]  who's going to support you. God bless you. We'll talk to you as that approaches.
[2:04:47.520 --> 2:04:52.800]  Thanks, Stuart. Thank you. More your call straight ahead. Bob Chapman as well. A ton of news.
[2:04:53.360 --> 2:04:56.400]  We are now entering the second American Revolution.
[2:04:56.400 --> 2:05:01.680]  Carol Salente is now written editorial concurring with my analysis. The illusion created by the
[2:05:01.680 --> 2:05:06.960]  power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat. Will you continue to be
[2:05:06.960 --> 2:05:11.600]  their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick, go to the doctor and buy
[2:05:11.600 --> 2:05:16.960]  their drugs? You don't have to cooperate. There is a solution. Inner Health Botanicals, a company

[2:05:58.400 --> 2:06:05.440]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this
[2:06:05.440 --> 2:06:09.920]  summer. Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[2:06:09.920 --> 2:06:15.200]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[2:06:15.200 --> 2:06:20.320]  to have. It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[2:06:20.320 --> 2:06:25.200]  is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded,
[2:06:25.200 --> 2:06:29.280]  especially with the high demand summer months ahead. Number four, the hurricane and dangerous
[2:06:29.280 --> 2:06:33.440]  summer storm season is here again. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from
[2:06:33.440 --> 2:06:38.480]  weather related outages. Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance
[2:06:38.480 --> 2:06:42.320]  and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by
[2:06:42.320 --> 2:06:46.800]  Solutions from Science, a long time sponsor of ours. You can get more information at

[2:08:20.160 --> 2:08:25.440]  and many others recall for coming up wide open phones for the next hour with Bob Chapman.
[2:08:26.400 --> 2:08:29.760]  I'm going to recap some of the top stories going to some of the other news I haven't covered yet.
[2:08:30.560 --> 2:08:33.920]  Bob, there's so much to talk about for those that don't know. Bob Chapman of course is in
[2:08:33.920 --> 2:08:40.960]  military intelligence during the Cold War in Berlin. Then he became one of the most successful
[2:08:40.960 --> 2:08:45.360]  silver and gold traders out there. He also helped publish some of the original Patriot
[2:08:45.360 --> 2:08:50.800]  publications like Gary Allen's Dunder called a conspiracy that woke me up. Really, there's one
[2:08:50.800 --> 2:08:55.840]  founding thing that really put it all together. I had the info kind of the term born awake. I mean,
[2:08:55.840 --> 2:08:59.840]  I just grew up knowing history, knowing the truth, learning it as I went. But that film
[2:08:59.840 --> 2:09:05.360]  really crystallized things when I was about 14 or 15 and read it. He was involved publishing that,
[2:09:05.920 --> 2:09:09.040]  worked with so many other people and of course has one of the biggest newsletters out there,
[2:09:09.040 --> 2:09:13.680]  they're an actual forecaster. They're an actual forecaster.com, our websites info wars.com.
[2:09:13.680 --> 2:09:18.000]  But I want to move through just quick topics with you. Let's cover the economy first.
[2:09:19.280 --> 2:09:21.920]  They keep saying it's the end of the recession. Everything's fine.
[2:09:22.560 --> 2:09:28.320]  558,000 people lost their job in the last month. The job losses are accelerating. The
[2:09:28.320 --> 2:09:34.560]  restaurants are closing, the factories, the industries. I wish things were getting better,
[2:09:34.560 --> 2:09:39.040]  but all the real indicators of Main Street, unless I'm wrong, Bob, show an implosion.
[2:09:39.040 --> 2:09:45.680]  But then they are taking their 27, their 23.7 and that's a month old number. We'll get new
[2:09:45.680 --> 2:09:51.840]  numbers the next month, 23.7 trillion, almost double the GDP stolen in 10 months. They are
[2:09:51.840 --> 2:09:56.640]  pumping it in, but they admit that's mainly institutional buyers of those stocks and bonds.
[2:09:56.640 --> 2:10:00.960]  They're buying up infrastructure. The banks aren't lending. The federal reserve's paying the
[2:10:00.960 --> 2:10:06.320]  not land. The dollar's going down, gold's going up. Are we going to see another run-up in commodities
[2:10:06.320 --> 2:10:12.960]  like we saw a year and a half ago? Bob Chapman, are these green shoots or what's really happening?
[2:10:14.000 --> 2:10:22.000]  You could poison Ivy. How's that for an opener? He went right into it. I thank you very much.
[2:10:22.000 --> 2:10:31.520]  But listen, if everything was so hunky-dory, why have three top officials and top people,
[2:10:31.520 --> 2:10:37.520]  we'll say, in economics come out and said, I think we might need another stimulus here,
[2:10:37.520 --> 2:10:43.520]  like I projected last January. I talked in terms of two trillion. I know even Joe Stiglitz has
[2:10:43.520 --> 2:10:50.240]  come out and he's at Harvard and he's an eminent World Bank economist. He says, yeah, we need one
[2:10:50.240 --> 2:10:55.840]  of these. We've got to give Keynesianism a chance. What he's saying is, I don't think the first go
[2:10:55.840 --> 2:11:03.200]  around was allocated properly in the right places at the right time. The people who got the checks,
[2:11:03.200 --> 2:11:08.560]  they went out and paid all their bills with them instead of spending them. They got a lot of what's
[2:11:08.560 --> 2:11:13.280]  involved in the stimulus package is a lot of tax breaks. It takes too long for them to come down
[2:11:13.280 --> 2:11:19.120]  the pike. And so he's talking in terms like others are in the administration. They're getting the
[2:11:19.120 --> 2:11:23.840]  bull rolling. By the end of the year, they'll be looking for that two trillion so that this thing
[2:11:23.840 --> 2:11:30.320]  doesn't go under. But I think the big story here that nobody has talked about, and that's usually
[2:11:30.320 --> 2:11:36.160]  the case when I start spouting off about what's going on, there's something hidden here that
[2:11:36.160 --> 2:11:43.360]  people don't understand. I'm going to make it as simple as possible. It was recently that the
[2:11:43.360 --> 2:11:53.600]  Fed reserve, again, created $500 billion out of nothing. They lent that or exchanged that with
[2:11:53.600 --> 2:12:00.640]  five other major central banks and received currencies for that. And they received dollars.
[2:12:02.320 --> 2:12:08.720]  They used those currencies to go into the foreign exchange market to push, while they sell those
[2:12:08.720 --> 2:12:14.080]  foreign currencies to push those currencies down so that the dollar will go up. And that's what
[2:12:14.080 --> 2:12:23.120]  that's for. But they're doing something else. They are having those central banks take those
[2:12:23.120 --> 2:12:31.520]  dollars that they have and go into the Treasury auction market and buy US Treasury bills, notes,
[2:12:31.520 --> 2:12:36.640]  and bonds. So that's monetizing the debt, but they're doing it by laundering it through foreign
[2:12:36.640 --> 2:12:43.200]  banks. Exactly. Now, let me give you some statistics. I'm writing a piece on China.
[2:12:43.920 --> 2:12:46.880]  I don't know whether it'll get published this weekend, probably on Wednesday.
[2:12:47.520 --> 2:12:56.320]  And the Chinese, it looks like they've sold off about $600 billion with a dollar-denominated assets
[2:12:56.320 --> 2:13:08.880]  taking their dollar-denominated assets down to $1.1 trillion. Now, they have not been buying
[2:13:08.880 --> 2:13:17.040]  Treasuries. And so there's an absence of buying of $500 billion to a trillion dollars. So we'll
[2:13:17.040 --> 2:13:24.400]  say $700 billion. So if you take it both ways, you've got a sale of $600 and a non-buy of $700.
[2:13:24.400 --> 2:13:40.960]  That's one point... I lost my train of thought there. It's a $500 and $700. That's $1.3 trillion
[2:13:42.000 --> 2:13:46.800]  that was either sold or didn't participate. And somebody's got to come up with that money,
[2:13:48.480 --> 2:13:52.400]  foreign central banks of some kind, and they're not coming up with it. They're buying,
[2:13:52.400 --> 2:13:57.040]  but they're not buying enough. So the difference that they're not buying, the Fed's buying,
[2:13:57.040 --> 2:14:01.520]  and they're creating the money to do so through the foreign central banks, and they're trying
[2:14:01.520 --> 2:14:08.560]  to be puddle everybody. And when foreigners find out what they're doing secretly, they're going
[2:14:08.560 --> 2:14:20.800]  to freak out because they're holding 64.5% of the foreign exchange that they have in dollars.
[2:14:20.800 --> 2:14:26.640]  So if the dollar goes down because of what the Fed's doing behind the scenes, they're going to
[2:14:26.640 --> 2:14:32.640]  be very unhappy about that. But the Fed is also, just to interrupt here, the Fed is also,
[2:14:33.440 --> 2:14:38.800]  as you said, and this has been confirmed, it's also devaluing their currency so everybody's
[2:14:38.800 --> 2:14:45.120]  sinking so that it's not as noticeable, and then all of the assets are going to the elites.
[2:14:45.120 --> 2:14:55.840]  That's correct. And the Chinese could be out of the dollar in a year, maybe a year and a half,
[2:14:56.480 --> 2:15:04.000]  dependent. And that's why, that's a big reason why the dollar's going to get out and test 71-18.
[2:15:04.000 --> 2:15:13.040]  It's now around 78 and a half or so. And I think when it tests, it may well break through to the
[2:15:13.040 --> 2:15:19.520]  downside. And the reason I say that is all these other nations who have been holding on, they're
[2:15:19.520 --> 2:15:24.160]  going to say, hey, we've been taken. Now, how long that's going to take? I don't know. It could take
[2:15:24.160 --> 2:15:30.000]  six months. It could take two and a half years. I don't know. We don't know what the reaction
[2:15:30.000 --> 2:15:35.520]  of these governments is going to be because don't forget that when they don't do what Washington
[2:15:35.520 --> 2:15:42.080]  tells them, and they're very strong about, we don't want to do that, Washington tells them,
[2:15:42.080 --> 2:15:49.280]  do you want your country invaded? I mean, do you want your internet and banking services cut off?
[2:15:49.280 --> 2:15:54.960]  Do you want your postal from the United States cut off? You planes can't land in our country.
[2:15:55.760 --> 2:16:02.800]  And this is true. They do this because I've been told by ex-heads of state that they actually do
[2:16:02.800 --> 2:16:10.080]  this. So this is where this is all leading. And the dollar going down is a lead pipe such.
[2:16:10.080 --> 2:16:14.560]  You know, the good money is how bad it'll be. Well, Bob, that's what the world government is.
[2:16:14.560 --> 2:16:21.280]  They brag this new bank of the world won't just by fiat or intimidation or arm twisting
[2:16:21.280 --> 2:16:25.600]  or claiming you're a terrorist state and putting embargoes on you or sanctions.
[2:16:25.600 --> 2:16:30.800]  They are going to openly have the power to manipulate all the currencies and manipulate
[2:16:30.800 --> 2:16:37.120]  the interest rates and tell nations what carbon footprint they can have and selectively even
[2:16:37.120 --> 2:16:43.280]  rig things more than it is now and use command destruction in their own words. They want negative
[2:16:43.280 --> 2:16:48.000]  growth to consolidate for the good of the environment. But really, that's just their
[2:16:48.000 --> 2:16:52.480]  psychological excuse for their minions of why they're doing this. I mean, this is so
[2:16:52.480 --> 2:16:57.760]  diabolical. Here's the next question. How is it going for them? Are things going well
[2:16:57.760 --> 2:17:02.960]  in your expert opinion? I think they're not going well for them. And that was pointed out
[2:17:02.960 --> 2:17:10.080]  in Greece at the Bilderberger Conference. And what they're trying to do, I think,
[2:17:10.080 --> 2:17:16.480]  is pull this thing back and stop it. And I think it's way beyond their ability to stop
[2:17:17.200 --> 2:17:22.240]  this destruction economically and financially of not only the United States, but the world.
[2:17:22.240 --> 2:17:25.200]  And I really think that that's what they're trying to do in here. And that's what I think
[2:17:25.200 --> 2:17:31.680]  they agreed on. And I don't think it's possible. It would be good, actually, if it was possible.
[2:17:31.680 --> 2:17:40.400]  But June of 2002 was the date when you would flown too far and you couldn't go back,
[2:17:41.280 --> 2:17:47.920]  the point of no return. And they're going to have to live with it. And if it doesn't work out for them,
[2:17:49.840 --> 2:17:53.840]  what's going to happen is the public is going to say, all right, who did this to us?
[2:17:53.840 --> 2:17:57.360]  They're going to line them up in court, and they're going to put them in jail,
[2:17:57.360 --> 2:18:02.640]  and they're going to take their waltz away from them if they're lucky. If we have a repeat of
[2:18:02.640 --> 2:18:10.240]  the French Revolution, I don't think it's going to be very nice. But Bob, the problem is the
[2:18:10.240 --> 2:18:14.560]  establishment, and I'm sure that now with the Southern Property Law Center's declaration,
[2:18:14.560 --> 2:18:18.880]  demonizing any gun owners or anybody that doesn't want world government, the feds are going to
[2:18:18.880 --> 2:18:23.440]  stage terror attacks against themselves. We even have congressmen coming out saying they're going
[2:18:23.440 --> 2:18:30.080]  to stage something. They may use flu for martial law. Congressman Brown is in the Louisville Journal.
[2:18:30.080 --> 2:18:36.640]  This is all very clear. Their only move is to play the victim. And they always do that with a
[2:18:36.640 --> 2:18:42.640]  Reichstag event. And I agree that people are so angry and so awake that that's probably going to blow
[2:18:42.640 --> 2:18:52.160]  up. But I don't see the hubris filled establishment backing off. So I see this playing out with a
[2:18:52.160 --> 2:18:57.680]  lot of fireworks. And I agree with you. The evidence of Geithner chewing the carpet, blowing up,
[2:18:57.680 --> 2:19:05.120]  screaming at Bernanke. Other evidence coming out shows that all is not well in Camelot. And that
[2:19:06.480 --> 2:19:12.400]  the pit they dug for us is going to infold them. And lastly, it's clear, and now they're even
[2:19:12.400 --> 2:19:16.880]  starting to admit this, that they're creating a depression on Main Street as they pump out all
[2:19:16.880 --> 2:19:23.200]  these fiat dollars to pay off their derivatives debts and that they're paying banks not to loan
[2:19:23.200 --> 2:19:28.720]  because if the banks did loan, we'd have inflation. So instead, you literally have the elite being able
[2:19:28.720 --> 2:19:33.840]  to buy everything up. We pay the interest on giving them the money. And then we get to live in a
[2:19:33.840 --> 2:19:39.760]  depression. So I want your take on that. We get back and we're going to phone calls at 1-800-25-99231.
[2:19:40.480 --> 2:19:46.080]  Pentagon wants authority to pose 400,000 military personnel in the U.S. This is official congressional
[2:19:46.080 --> 2:19:53.200]  report. I mean, that's just off the chart. And the troops are training for martial law drills,
[2:19:53.200 --> 2:20:17.200]  mainstream news. We're going to go over that too. Big hour and 40 minutes left. Stay with us.
[2:20:23.200 --> 2:20:29.760]  Onions, cabbage, lettuce, pumpkins, spinach, peas, wheatgrass, and much more. And the best part?

[2:20:40.720 --> 2:20:46.080]  And in this economy, saving money is always welcome, especially when it comes to our food supply.

[2:21:01.520 --> 2:21:06.880]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[2:21:07.520 --> 2:21:12.480]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would
[2:21:12.480 --> 2:21:18.000]  like to see. The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the
[2:21:18.000 --> 2:21:23.520]  best interest of the American people. Well, Obama's already fudging. Yeah, fudged since day one in
[2:21:23.520 --> 2:21:28.640]  this election. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists
[2:21:28.640 --> 2:21:35.440]  who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[2:21:37.440 --> 2:21:41.040]  It's not about left to right. It's about a one-world government.
[2:21:41.040 --> 2:21:48.800]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda. Get your copy

[2:24:00.240 --> 2:24:20.160]  Crashing Through the Lies and Disinformation. It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:24:21.280 --> 2:24:27.440]  Bob, I catch myself pinching myself like I'm in a dream.
[2:24:27.440 --> 2:24:33.920]  To have mainstream news reporting, they're doing martial law drills, how to lock down cities,
[2:24:33.920 --> 2:24:40.400]  how to forcibly inoculate people. The Pentagon now wants 400,000 to deal with emergency terrorism
[2:24:40.400 --> 2:24:45.200]  and insurrection. I mean, there's no doubt they're going to completely turn into a total red dawn
[2:24:45.200 --> 2:24:50.000]  armed camp with checkpoints. And I mean, this is tyranny. The government is totally rogue and
[2:24:50.000 --> 2:24:56.400]  criminal. Doesn't matter what administration, but Governor's Association, according to the Hill
[2:24:56.400 --> 2:25:02.560]  newspaper, have sent a letter to them saying this is a takeover. We're concerned. Your federal power
[2:25:02.560 --> 2:25:10.240]  grab, you know, the Pentagon doing this. We've got Congressman Brown telling the Louisville
[2:25:10.240 --> 2:25:18.640]  newspaper that they may want to use and that quote, the elite want to use the flu pandemic.
[2:25:18.640 --> 2:25:26.320]  They may stage it as a pretext for martial law. I mean, Bob Chapman, it's the stuff we
[2:25:26.320 --> 2:25:32.400]  were talking about years ago is now becoming mainstream. I'd say our movement is 50 times
[2:25:32.400 --> 2:25:37.680]  bigger conservatively than it was in the mid 1990s when the feds bombed themselves to play the part
[2:25:37.680 --> 2:25:43.920]  of victims. I don't see an Oklahoma city or something or even a stage mass shooting.
[2:25:43.920 --> 2:25:49.120]  They staged to blame us. I don't see that working. We've done our job exposing the globalist.
[2:25:50.240 --> 2:25:55.360]  I mean, we're still got a long way to go here, but I think we have irrevocably damaged the
[2:25:55.360 --> 2:26:05.120]  new world order. And I agree. And we've talked about this in the past several weeks. And the
[2:26:05.120 --> 2:26:11.360]  internet and the broadcasting that we've been able to get out has forced their hand.
[2:26:12.160 --> 2:26:17.200]  And they're going to have to try to go for it here because what they're doing financially
[2:26:17.200 --> 2:26:25.360]  and economically is blowing up on them. I figure that by the Chinese selling US dollar
[2:26:25.360 --> 2:26:33.760]  denominated assets and not buying US denominated assets has had to have made the fed secretly
[2:26:34.880 --> 2:26:42.480]  this year purchase somewhere between $500 billion and $800 billion worth of treasury
[2:26:42.480 --> 2:26:50.560]  and and GSC paper, which is Fannie Freddie and Jenny. And and that's what they're up to.
[2:26:50.560 --> 2:26:54.080]  Well, no, they admitted to Congress. They bought it, but they wouldn't say how much.
[2:26:55.200 --> 2:27:01.760]  No, that was another program that was announced that program there. This is beside that program.
[2:27:01.760 --> 2:27:12.960]  Oh, that program there was $300 billion in treasury, $600 billion in GSCs and $1.2 trillion in CDOs.
[2:27:12.960 --> 2:27:20.160]  Then I saw Bernanke at a town hall meeting say he's not monetizing. I mean, that's like him
[2:27:20.160 --> 2:27:28.880]  going on TV and saying dollars aren't green. Well, they all lie. It's part of the sociopathic
[2:27:28.880 --> 2:27:35.760]  and psychopathic mind trail of what we're dealing with here. I mean, we're, we're dealing with a
[2:27:35.760 --> 2:27:40.720]  bunch of colligulants, hundreds of them. I mean, these people are really insane.
[2:27:43.200 --> 2:27:47.840]  What do you think about the fact that they first demonized three weeks ago? And I told you it was
[2:27:47.840 --> 2:27:54.320]  going to be big news, folks. I can see these trends. And I make that point so people pay
[2:27:54.320 --> 2:27:58.160]  attention to what we're saying here. We know what we're talking about. First, they said it was all
[2:27:58.160 --> 2:28:03.440]  fake. Now they've had to apologize and say, okay, it wasn't fake. So see how they arrogantly tried
[2:28:03.440 --> 2:28:07.280]  to say it was fake. And I said two weeks ago, Bob said two weeks ago, that was going to blow
[2:28:07.280 --> 2:28:12.000]  up only bigger. Now they've done the smart thing and apologized, but too little too late, Bob.
[2:28:13.840 --> 2:28:20.400]  Yeah, we just got to continue the steamroller. People have got to continue to be outspoken
[2:28:20.400 --> 2:28:28.240]  like you, sir, at the town hall meetings, like at the tea parties, the promulgation of a movement
[2:28:28.800 --> 2:28:35.040]  by Ron Paul. It's got to get bigger and better. We have to drive them crazy. We have to get in
[2:28:35.040 --> 2:28:42.560]  their face. And if we don't do that, we may end up fighting in the streets. And so we've got to do
[2:28:42.560 --> 2:28:48.240]  it. We've got to show them that we're not going to back down. We got to show them how powerful we
[2:28:48.240 --> 2:28:57.280]  can be. And we have to tell the military, you're our guys. We want to be with you. We don't want to be
[2:28:58.480 --> 2:29:04.560]  against you. And so get it together. The government is giving you unlawful orders.
[2:29:05.680 --> 2:29:10.720]  And that's exactly what that is. It's a violation of Posse Kamutakis. And they know it.
[2:29:11.920 --> 2:29:13.520]  The military people know it.
[2:29:13.520 --> 2:29:22.880]  Well, they certainly do. I mean, a year and a half ago, 70-plus percent of the campaign donations
[2:29:22.880 --> 2:29:26.960]  were to Ron Paul from the military. But I guess that's why they're trying to get rid of all the
[2:29:26.960 --> 2:29:31.360]  citizens and our felons and illegal aliens. We're going to go right to your phone calls,
[2:29:31.360 --> 2:29:39.200]  D. Jeff, Inger, John, Dave, and others, 1-800-259-9231. Add your question and comment ready.
[2:29:39.200 --> 2:29:44.720]  We'll go right to you on the other side of this break. And then we're scheduled to have Ambassador
[2:29:44.720 --> 2:29:49.600]  Alan Keyes on, on a host of issues in the final hour today.
[2:29:51.520 --> 2:29:58.160]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[2:30:01.280 --> 2:30:05.840]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions. If you're going into a battle
[2:30:05.840 --> 2:30:09.680]  and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[2:30:09.680 --> 2:30:14.960]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[2:30:14.960 --> 2:30:19.040]  Food is your only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it?
[2:30:19.040 --> 2:30:24.160]  Now or after the battle starts? When will you need it? Can you buy it without proper identification?
[2:30:24.160 --> 2:30:29.040]  Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed
[2:30:29.040 --> 2:30:34.080]  yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems
[2:30:34.080 --> 2:30:39.680]  if you have a good food supply. Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[2:30:39.680 --> 2:30:44.880]  How much will you need? We don't know. How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones.
[2:30:44.880 --> 2:30:52.880]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out

[2:30:59.520 --> 2:31:05.520]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[2:31:05.520 --> 2:31:10.080]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[2:31:10.080 --> 2:31:15.200]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs? You don't have to cooperate. There is a solution.

[2:32:02.320 --> 2:32:06.720]  each of you to ask yourself this question. Do you really know what's in your tap water? In a
[2:32:06.720 --> 2:32:12.320]  recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals in
[2:32:12.320 --> 2:32:16.960]  pollutants are present in municipal drinking water. Many of these chemicals are directly linked to
[2:32:16.960 --> 2:32:21.840]  cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases. Now what are you going to do
[2:32:21.840 --> 2:32:27.520]  about it? The Acola Blue atmospheric water generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you
[2:32:27.520 --> 2:32:32.240]  and your family's drinking water. The Acola Blue 28 produces up to seven gallons of water from the
[2:32:32.240 --> 2:32:38.080]  humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent
[2:32:38.080 --> 2:32:44.240]  light sterilization techniques. That's right, clean water right from the air you breathe. Order today

[2:33:28.080 --> 2:33:39.520]  We are going to your phone calls and a host of other news items here in just a minute or two.
[2:33:40.160 --> 2:33:45.200]  I wanted to first tell all the radio listeners and prisonplanet.tv viewers watching us right now
[2:33:46.320 --> 2:33:53.040]  as we simulcast the radio show as a television show that we have all the Obama shirts in,
[2:33:53.040 --> 2:34:01.840]  eight different varieties of Obama with the iconic Joker paint as the psychopathic criminal
[2:34:01.840 --> 2:34:06.320]  that he is for the New World Order lying about everything. Everything he says is a complete lie,
[2:34:06.880 --> 2:34:10.960]  even worse than Bush when it comes to lying. Bush actually did a few of the things he said he would
[2:34:10.960 --> 2:34:19.520]  do. What he was doing was unconstitutional. These are all available at infowars.com.
[2:34:19.520 --> 2:34:24.160]  You can also print off the free flyers and I would suggest you put them in legal,
[2:34:24.160 --> 2:34:28.880]  lawful places. That's wherever you see a bunch of other posters and inch thick
[2:34:28.880 --> 2:34:34.560]  in your city center or wherever. If they come after you for that, that's selective enforcement.
[2:34:34.560 --> 2:34:38.800]  They're thugs and they're trying to intimidate everybody and say you better not do it. That's
[2:34:38.800 --> 2:34:45.280]  because they're scared of it. Meanwhile, the president tells his supporters the Washington Post.
[2:34:45.280 --> 2:34:52.240]  We have that linked up on infowars.com to go out and put his image everywhere. The iconic hope
[2:34:52.240 --> 2:34:59.040]  image where he's like mousetongue or linen looking off into the distance thinking about the property
[2:34:59.040 --> 2:35:05.520]  he's going to steal from people. So that is available again at infowars.com. You get the
[2:35:05.520 --> 2:35:16.720]  t-shirts or call toll free 888-2533139er. We also have films like the Obama deception

[2:35:31.120 --> 2:35:35.920]  made today's show possible, the best storeable foods company in the nation also has the best
[2:35:35.920 --> 2:35:41.840]  prices I've found. The food is packed every day, every week at none of it is old. Most of the
[2:35:41.840 --> 2:35:45.920]  other companies, because I bought from two or three others, I guess more than two. It's embarrassing.
[2:35:45.920 --> 2:35:54.240]  It was ancient five, 10, 15 year old crap or C rations from Vietnam. This is brand new, non-GMO,
[2:35:54.240 --> 2:36:03.360]  non-hybrid. And it's high quality right here in America. Only thing not grown here is the
[2:36:03.360 --> 2:36:11.280]  tropical bananas, but those are non-GMO. So efoodsdirect.com, the letter efoodsdirect.com.

[2:36:22.400 --> 2:36:29.360]  forget, the web address and the toll free number is 800-409-5633. You can call and get a free brochure,
[2:36:29.360 --> 2:36:36.720]  800-409-5633. And with all the things coming up, the martial law, the government hyping the flu,
[2:36:37.360 --> 2:36:41.520]  I hope none of this happens. But you got governors and senators talking about it now
[2:36:41.520 --> 2:36:46.320]  and saying they may use it for martial law. You're insane if you don't have firearms and food.
[2:36:46.320 --> 2:36:55.920]  efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633. And then lastly, Diginet personal audio video recorders. The
[2:36:55.920 --> 2:37:04.640]  website is diganet.net. Now, I just last year bought the very same digital video audio recorder
[2:37:04.640 --> 2:37:13.120]  pen they have for like $150 to sneak into the Bilderberg Group meeting. And it's a great pen,
[2:37:13.120 --> 2:37:18.720]  but I paid three times as much. They are a huge bulk seller, one of the leaders out there. That's
[2:37:18.720 --> 2:37:22.800]  how they do it. They got a bunch of other systems, little hidden cameras that go in your car that
[2:37:22.800 --> 2:37:27.840]  are very reliable and wire into just a memory card hidden in the car where you hit one button
[2:37:27.840 --> 2:37:32.160]  and you can record the police when they pull you over or anybody else for that matter. Very,
[2:37:32.160 --> 2:37:38.480]  very useful to protect yourself and admissible in court. Diginet.net, fight fire with fire,
[2:37:38.480 --> 2:37:47.200]  use big brother against big brother, diginet.net, diginet.net. I want to thank those sponsors

[2:37:52.560 --> 2:37:57.600]  that carry the show. Support them as well. They make it all possible. Without them, we wouldn't be
[2:37:57.600 --> 2:38:05.360]  here. Okay, coming up when I start the next hour, we've got Ambassador Allen Key scheduled.
[2:38:05.360 --> 2:38:10.080]  I'll just let you know about that. And there's a clay nation. Somebody did. If a good rant,
[2:38:10.080 --> 2:38:13.920]  I did. So we're going to play that coming up at the end of this hour. Bob, you ready to take some
[2:38:13.920 --> 2:38:23.680]  calls? I sure am. Awesome. Let's go ahead and talk to D in Arizona. D, you're on the air.
[2:38:24.560 --> 2:38:29.840]  Hi, Alex. How are you? This is D trust and Tempe. I have a question for you two gentlemen,
[2:38:29.840 --> 2:38:34.400]  but first I wanted to thank you. You guys are doing a great job getting all the information out.
[2:38:34.400 --> 2:38:39.840]  If I wish more people would wake up, it's frustrating to see people around you just
[2:38:39.840 --> 2:38:47.760]  walking around in a daze. My question is, I understand that we're supposed to be the people
[2:38:47.760 --> 2:38:53.360]  and they're supposed to take out votes and get our opinions and things like that. And obviously,
[2:38:53.360 --> 2:38:57.840]  that's not happening. You don't have to be a genius to see that. But what happened to
[2:38:57.840 --> 2:39:04.720]  like making citizens arrest and impeaching people from Congress and actually, you know,
[2:39:04.720 --> 2:39:09.680]  getting them out of office and getting people in there who can do something. Let me comment on
[2:39:09.680 --> 2:39:14.960]  that D and then we'll get your comeback after Bob comments briefly. This is a whole issue.
[2:39:16.000 --> 2:39:21.360]  The states are constituted by the people. So under state law, they can create incorporated
[2:39:21.360 --> 2:39:25.840]  cities and counties. The people, you can go out to the middle of nowhere, start your own city
[2:39:25.840 --> 2:39:31.040]  and then you can hire cops and then they can go out and give people tickets. But if you do
[2:39:31.040 --> 2:39:37.120]  something outside of the law, you get the book thrown at you. Instead, the government breaks
[2:39:37.120 --> 2:39:42.080]  the law and doesn't get in trouble because they're engaging in corruption. Citizens arrest was a lot
[2:39:42.080 --> 2:39:48.000]  of towns, even towns that might have had a couple of thousand people in them would have one sheriff,
[2:39:48.000 --> 2:39:53.840]  maybe two deputies for a thousand or more people. But then the sheriff had auxiliary deputies
[2:39:53.840 --> 2:39:58.560]  outstanding members of the community who weren't corrupt, who if they saw a problem,
[2:39:58.560 --> 2:40:01.920]  they would do something. Or even if you weren't, if you saw somebody robbing,
[2:40:01.920 --> 2:40:05.040]  you go over and con come on the head of they resisted and citizens arrest.
[2:40:05.600 --> 2:40:11.040]  But the government demonizes that because they don't want, they want a monopoly of power and
[2:40:11.040 --> 2:40:16.080]  force. And so that's why in England where the citizens arrest started under the common law,
[2:40:16.080 --> 2:40:23.760]  Magna Carta, they try to demonize people defending, you know, their rights. And if you even
[2:40:23.760 --> 2:40:30.160]  punch somebody robbing your house, they arrest you. So they have slowly taught us that we don't
[2:40:30.160 --> 2:40:37.040]  have rights. That's why it's important people wear guns in open because and have demonstrations
[2:40:37.040 --> 2:40:41.600]  doing that, showing people we still have a second amendment because people think guns are illegal
[2:40:41.600 --> 2:40:46.320]  in your house now because the TV told them it's all lies. People think it's the law. You got to
[2:40:46.320 --> 2:40:52.800]  take vaccines. We're showing the world. It's not the law. We're exposing the hoax, the mind trick.
[2:40:52.800 --> 2:41:00.480]  Bob Chapman. Alex, I can't add much to that because you've covered it all. I think the bottom
[2:41:00.480 --> 2:41:07.360]  line is it's very difficult to try to use citizens arrest today. And you can get yourself in trouble
[2:41:07.360 --> 2:41:15.120]  by doing so because of the distortion of law. Well, who can do something? I mean, just like,
[2:41:15.120 --> 2:41:21.120]  I don't know, maybe you guys remember back. I think it was in 2007. Cynthia McKinney was going
[2:41:21.120 --> 2:41:25.680]  through the records and, you know, mentioned that there was three trillion dollars missing
[2:41:25.680 --> 2:41:30.880]  and then it just stopped, you know, and that's what happens. I mean, people say something and
[2:41:30.880 --> 2:41:35.200]  then they object and then and then that's the end of it and then move on to the next thing to
[2:41:35.200 --> 2:41:41.040]  exactly that's that's what tyrants and thugs do is once they've trained you to accept corruption,
[2:41:41.040 --> 2:41:47.120]  the sky's the limit. Thank you, D. It was two trillion when a bush got into office. It was over
[2:41:47.120 --> 2:41:52.560]  five trillion by the time he left, the Pentagon gets up before Congress and says, we're not telling
[2:41:52.560 --> 2:41:58.320]  you where the money is and they literally laugh at Congress. Folks, that's why they've stolen 23.7
[2:41:59.280 --> 2:42:05.280]  in banking the last 10 months. Why not? Why not steal 100 trillion? Why not steal 50 trillion?
[2:42:05.280 --> 2:42:12.320]  Why not steal a, you know, quadrillion? They don't care. They are going for broke. And what
[2:42:12.320 --> 2:42:15.920]  concerns me the most is now they're acting like nothing's going to be left. They're just grabbing,
[2:42:15.920 --> 2:42:21.920]  stealing and then leaving the country. Bob Chapman, you're absolutely correct. And they're going to
[2:42:21.920 --> 2:42:27.120]  keep right on doing it as long as they can do it to enrich themselves before this whole thing
[2:42:27.120 --> 2:42:34.240]  collapses as insulation of you as you, if you may, and I can assure you they're not keeping it in
[2:42:34.240 --> 2:42:39.760]  dollars. You know, they're buying four or five mansions, but they're also buying gold and silver.
[2:42:39.760 --> 2:42:47.360]  They have to be. Well, you know, what else is safe with their money? Absolutely. Thank you,
[2:42:47.360 --> 2:42:52.240]  D. Jeff in Ohio. You're on the air with a fellow that heads up the international forecaster.com.
[2:42:52.240 --> 2:42:58.000]  Go ahead. Hey, thanks for taking my call. Yeah, I heard you mentioned earlier in the program,
[2:42:58.720 --> 2:43:06.320]  Gary Allen. And I'm curious though about, you know, we've, you know, and I appreciate what
[2:43:06.320 --> 2:43:11.040]  you're doing, you know, trying to expose, you know, the global elites and all that,
[2:43:11.040 --> 2:43:17.840]  but have you ever read a conspiracy, a biblical view by Dr. Gary North?
[2:43:19.920 --> 2:43:25.600]  I don't believe so, but I've, I've, I've, I've heard of it. Have you ever, well, yeah, Gary North,
[2:43:25.600 --> 2:43:34.560]  that he, he is based in Texas, I believe, but it basically did his premise and I tend to agree
[2:43:34.560 --> 2:43:41.280]  is that, and this is where, where I'm concerned and frustrated is that
[2:43:43.200 --> 2:43:51.520]  that we try, we've been trying for years to try to expose the elites, yet the thing is,
[2:43:52.400 --> 2:43:55.600]  I'm kind of wondering if Gary North hit it on the head because
[2:43:57.040 --> 2:44:04.000]  that he contends that exposure is not enough. You know, we, we tend to think that, you know,
[2:44:04.000 --> 2:44:10.080]  if everybody just knew about this, these global elites, they'd do the right thing.
[2:44:11.120 --> 2:44:16.400]  He contends though that no, that's not necessarily the case. And the thing is,
[2:44:16.400 --> 2:44:22.640]  I also remember Edmund Burke says people to get the leadership they deserve. And
[2:44:23.600 --> 2:44:28.640]  Listen, Jeff, Jeff, you, you make a good point. Let's get a comment from Bob Chapman,
[2:44:28.640 --> 2:44:30.000]  then you can follow up. Go ahead, Bob.
[2:44:30.000 --> 2:44:34.720]  Bob, what is the solution that Mr. North gives us?
[2:44:36.000 --> 2:44:45.120]  Well, he says basically to start working from the ground up from the bottom up and basically
[2:44:45.120 --> 2:44:50.400]  follow biblical ethics. Well, that's exactly what we do. And we have a guest after guest
[2:44:50.400 --> 2:44:58.160]  after guest 50 years. And gee, I've known Gary North for 30 years. I know him quite well. Well,
[2:44:58.160 --> 2:45:02.960]  I mean, let's just be clear. And I don't think you're criticizing and implying we're doing this,
[2:45:02.960 --> 2:45:09.520]  but we kind of ruffle our feathers and take umbrage. I have G. Evergryphon on over and over again
[2:45:09.520 --> 2:45:15.200]  about the long view of history, his freedom force international. I believe going for a long view,
[2:45:16.320 --> 2:45:22.640]  shock, uh, short view and the middle view. I say attack on all fronts. I believe action
[2:45:23.280 --> 2:45:27.200]  and motivation and throwing yourself against the gears of the globalist.
[2:45:27.200 --> 2:45:31.760]  You have to first expose it. So we're simultaneously doing that and now having
[2:45:32.400 --> 2:45:38.080]  they've gone from saying 10 years ago, the CFR didn't exist and Rothschilds didn't exist.
[2:45:38.080 --> 2:45:42.720]  There are hundreds of news articles. Bob, you remember all this saying it doesn't exist. Now
[2:45:42.720 --> 2:45:47.120]  they say, oh, it exists, but we need a world government. And so people are saying, no, we
[2:45:47.120 --> 2:45:51.920]  don't want that. See, if we just try to have solutions at the grassroots, no one knows what
[2:45:51.920 --> 2:45:55.840]  we're talking about. We have to teach them the language. It's like we have a different language.
[2:45:55.840 --> 2:45:59.760]  They've forgotten our language of liberty and freedom and history. So we're like trying to
[2:45:59.760 --> 2:46:04.640]  teach Helen Keller how to first understand this so we can then teach her how to, how to write
[2:46:04.640 --> 2:46:11.280]  and read with Braille and all this other stuff. So it's a multi, what I see is way too many people
[2:46:11.280 --> 2:46:17.280]  though, spending their time critiquing everyone else about the good job they need to do. Well,
[2:46:17.280 --> 2:46:20.640]  how about we just whoop some butt here? How about we just get in the fight because, you know,
[2:46:20.640 --> 2:46:24.880]  because I don't have time to sit her in quarterback, everybody else. And I'm not saying you're
[2:46:24.880 --> 2:46:30.320]  bad or Gary's bad or any of this is bad. My whole issue is all I talk about solutions.
[2:46:30.320 --> 2:46:35.840]  Reach out to the military and police to follow their oath. Huge solution. Put up posters everywhere,
[2:46:35.840 --> 2:46:41.520]  exposing Obama as a fraud and the new world order and giving them a website to go to. It gets people
[2:46:41.520 --> 2:46:46.320]  out, gets them active, gives them a sense of hope. Go to the town halls. How many years have I said
[2:46:46.320 --> 2:46:51.760]  that? Take over all their events. Don't let them have the illusion. I mean, I'm the guy 14 years
[2:46:51.760 --> 2:46:56.320]  ago going and getting arrested at town halls. Hey, this is, this is, it's happening. It's happening.
[2:46:56.320 --> 2:47:00.960]  It's happening and taking over the counties, taking over the cities. I was just telling the last
[2:47:00.960 --> 2:47:05.440]  caller that we created the towns and cities. We've got to take them over. I always say,
[2:47:05.440 --> 2:47:11.120]  don't focus on the national election. Focus on the local election that the national election
[2:47:11.120 --> 2:47:16.720]  overall is a diversion except for issues. That's why Ron Paul must run in 2012 because even if he
[2:47:16.720 --> 2:47:22.880]  has no chance of winning, he's there to inject real issues. Resistance is victory. Resistance is
[2:47:22.880 --> 2:47:28.720]  victory. The will to stand up and go, you may kick my butt, but I'm going to fight you as hard as I
[2:47:28.720 --> 2:47:35.920]  can. It's that spirit that cannot be defeated. And so I just get mad when I hear it in any way
[2:47:35.920 --> 2:47:41.200]  implied that, oh, well, you know, this person says this or, you know, the government we deserve.
[2:47:41.200 --> 2:47:44.640]  Yes, we're getting the government we deserve. That's why we're saying we're sorry we've been
[2:47:44.640 --> 2:47:49.520]  corrupt God. We're going to get up off our big fat butts and do something. Anything else, Jeff?
[2:47:50.640 --> 2:47:56.480]  Yeah, you also mentioned about the language of freedom. You know, that reminds me of in George
[2:47:56.480 --> 2:48:05.840]  Orwell's 1984, you know, they basically destroy words and, you know, bend and twist and distort
[2:48:05.840 --> 2:48:11.920]  the language so people can't even conceive of the notion of liberty. Excellent point. Now they're
[2:48:11.920 --> 2:48:17.760]  telling the public to say socialism or say a bad word about government means you want to kill Black
[2:48:17.760 --> 2:48:23.360]  people. It's racist. And some of the public actually believes it now and is calling for my death and
[2:48:23.360 --> 2:48:30.000]  saying, so you're not allowed to talk bad. And so I agree. So we go out and educate them to the hoax.
[2:48:30.000 --> 2:48:38.640]  Appreciate the call. Bob Chapman. I agree. But I think we have to look at everybody has a different
[2:48:38.640 --> 2:48:44.160]  or somewhat different approach to this and you're fighting on all fronts and I am too.
[2:48:45.200 --> 2:48:50.960]  Other people aren't and they can do what they can and we applaud them for what they're doing.
[2:48:51.920 --> 2:48:57.440]  But we're going to do it our way. Exactly. I mean, I never tell people how they should do something.
[2:48:58.000 --> 2:49:03.440]  Okay. And because I mean, I found in my life, if I start trying, we got too many people trying
[2:49:03.440 --> 2:49:08.960]  to be managers here. Okay. All I'm saying is folks, you're smart. You know what to do. You know,
[2:49:08.960 --> 2:49:12.960]  you're good. You know, you're not a new world order shell. The last thing the new order would
[2:49:12.960 --> 2:49:18.160]  tell you to do would be to take action peacefully and believe in yourself and get involved. People
[2:49:18.160 --> 2:49:22.640]  always say, I'm a fed. No, no, the feds would never say that. That's 180 degrees. You know,
[2:49:22.640 --> 2:49:28.160]  you're good. Let's just decide I'm bad. Just so the debate's over. Don't defend me. Leave Alex in
[2:49:28.160 --> 2:49:34.000]  the dust. I want to defeat the new world order. Go out then and wake people up, warn them, get
[2:49:34.000 --> 2:49:39.360]  involved. You know, that's real. You know, you're good. So there's no excuse. People say, well,
[2:49:39.360 --> 2:49:44.320]  they've got better ideas for posters. Start a poster contest. I mean, that's what this is all
[2:49:44.320 --> 2:49:51.360]  about folks. Let's take another call here. Inger in Florida. You're on the air. Hi Alex. Hi Bob.
[2:49:51.360 --> 2:49:56.640]  First time caller. Thank you so much for taking my call and for the awesome jobs you guys are
[2:49:56.640 --> 2:50:02.320]  doing waking up. Thank you for calling. Thank you for calling. Go ahead. There's been a lot going
[2:50:02.320 --> 2:50:07.120]  on in Southwest Florida and I know this isn't probably relative to what you've been talking
[2:50:07.120 --> 2:50:12.480]  about just now, but it's all relative. Go ahead. For the last few weeks, there's been hundreds
[2:50:12.480 --> 2:50:21.600]  of trucks coming out of the limestone quarry carrying limestone. And when I say hundreds,
[2:50:21.600 --> 2:50:25.360]  hundreds of trucks, they're Glover trucks. They're yellow trucks. They have the black
[2:50:25.360 --> 2:50:31.760]  tarp on the top to hold the stuff in. I was just online on the who website and that basically
[2:50:31.760 --> 2:50:37.200]  they're using they use line for the mass graves that's in the who document. Oh no, they admit
[2:50:37.200 --> 2:50:45.040]  they're preparing mass graves. I don't know about any total evidence of limestone trucks. Stay there.
[2:50:45.040 --> 2:50:49.120]  Stay there ma'am. Extruction is kicking back in a little bit. So that might be what that is,
[2:50:49.120 --> 2:50:52.320]  but we'll come back, talk about the mass graves, talk about all the Pentagon,
[2:50:52.320 --> 2:50:57.600]  Marshall Law Drills. That's all real and up on info wars.com and prison planet.com. Stay with us.
[2:51:22.400 --> 2:51:27.600]  Doctors who have tried heart and body extract with their patients are thrilled with the results as
[2:51:27.600 --> 2:51:32.560]  well. Here's what Dr. Goodman has to say about his experience with the product. If you notice that
[2:51:32.560 --> 2:51:38.000]  most times here at the drug ads on TV, they have a list of possible side effects. I find that if
[2:51:38.000 --> 2:51:42.560]  you're going to take something that is you're trading one problem for five or six other problems,
[2:51:42.560 --> 2:51:47.600]  that's me doesn't make sense. Using something that is natural, that is absorbed into the body,
[2:51:47.600 --> 2:51:51.840]  particularly because in a liquid form, I think is the best way to go. Call to order your two

[2:52:22.000 --> 2:52:27.360]  Obama's already fudging. Yeah, fudged since day one in this election. If you have a demagogue
[2:52:27.360 --> 2:52:32.960]  with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group
[2:52:32.960 --> 2:52:39.760]  of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism. It's not about left or right. It's about
[2:52:39.760 --> 2:52:46.160]  a one world government. This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told,

[2:54:17.440 --> 2:54:30.960]  Okay, anger in Florida to finish up. So they also get out of limestone the chemicals that they put
[2:54:30.960 --> 2:54:37.200]  in the water. When you hear the word fluoridation, it means over 300. Generally, it's about 130 or so.
[2:54:38.160 --> 2:54:45.360]  We got a tour of the Austin water treatment, but it is chemical waste and they also mine the limestone
[2:54:45.360 --> 2:54:53.360]  for fertilizer, for the chemicals they put in fertilizer. So, you know, I think just seeing
[2:54:53.360 --> 2:54:58.800]  some trucks drive around doesn't mean mass graves. All the official admissions by the federal government
[2:54:58.800 --> 2:55:04.560]  and the states of crematoriums and mass graves, though, does. In anger, I'm not criticizing you.
[2:55:04.560 --> 2:55:09.520]  We should all keep our eyes open, but we could keep our eyes open for congressmen and governors
[2:55:09.520 --> 2:55:14.400]  saying they're getting ready for martial law and that it's bad. I mean, this isn't like we're looking
[2:55:14.400 --> 2:55:19.680]  for this or anything because the way a straw man operator works is Glenn Beck would take your call
[2:55:19.680 --> 2:55:24.480]  from the show and say, look, she thinks it's mass graves from limestone and he'd go to the limestone
[2:55:24.480 --> 2:55:29.840]  quarry and they'd say, oh, we're doing this for fertilizer and then never look at the hundreds
[2:55:29.840 --> 2:55:34.720]  of admissions of the FEMA camp. See, that's how their twisted system works. But tell me more about
[2:55:34.720 --> 2:55:41.200]  this. Okay, I understand exactly what you're talking about. And yes, they could totally
[2:55:41.200 --> 2:55:45.280]  say that that wasn't what it was for. But these are hundreds and hundreds of trucks and we've
[2:55:45.280 --> 2:55:49.280]  never seen them before. And it's just been in the last few weeks. And on the who website,
[2:55:49.280 --> 2:55:55.520]  it clearly says under their how to dispose of bodies in an emergency situation that if it is
[2:55:56.400 --> 2:56:01.040]  considered what they are saying would be an epidemic that you would not use lime. You would
[2:56:01.040 --> 2:56:07.120]  use chlorine or other types of solutions like that. So that makes me think that it's not going to be
[2:56:07.120 --> 2:56:12.960]  related to, you know, the pandemic or the flu that they're trying to hide. But they may have just
[2:56:12.960 --> 2:56:19.280]  opened up a new aggregate mining facility. They have those all around where I live, mining marble
[2:56:19.280 --> 2:56:24.480]  and granite and limestone. I mean, all I'm saying is ma'am, it's all admitted they're building mass
[2:56:24.480 --> 2:56:29.840]  graves. I'm not debating you on that. I mean, what are the trucks? I mean, is it blocks of?
[2:56:29.840 --> 2:56:36.400]  Is it blocks of limestone? No, it's it's it's covered over in like, you know, like a black
[2:56:36.400 --> 2:56:41.120]  tarp that you see over a truck. So the stuff doesn't fly out of it. And what's weird is this
[2:56:41.120 --> 2:56:46.000]  has been going on just now for the last few weeks. And it's it's hundreds of trucks. But also just
[2:56:46.000 --> 2:56:53.680]  last week in Cape Coral on August the 7th, my husband took pictures of military helicopters,
[2:56:53.680 --> 2:56:58.800]  green ones flying and they have spray bars on them. And when my husband asked someone who lived
[2:56:58.800 --> 2:57:03.440]  in the neighborhood, why? Because he was just in that area for the day, why they were there. And
[2:57:03.440 --> 2:57:09.200]  he said, Oh, yeah, we saw it on the news that the military, the army sold the city a whole bunch
[2:57:09.200 --> 2:57:14.880]  of used helicopters to spray for mosquitoes. Well, we don't have that many mosquitoes. I mean,
[2:57:14.880 --> 2:57:18.880]  we have no no, I hear you. I hear you and I appreciate your call. I want to get Bob's comment
[2:57:18.880 --> 2:57:25.440]  here in closing on this. We'll take more calls with Allen keys coming up. But
[2:57:25.440 --> 2:57:31.200]  again, I just don't want to miss the forest for the trees here.
[2:57:33.200 --> 2:57:38.640]  They admittedly have built mass graves. They admittedly are gearing up for this 400,000 troops,
[2:57:39.360 --> 2:57:44.160]  whether they really released a deadly flu or not. This was clearly all stage they built up for
[2:57:44.160 --> 2:57:49.280]  this beforehand. And they're using it to train us for federalization. Bob, your take on this.
[2:57:49.280 --> 2:57:55.600]  I don't see the government giving used helicopters to
[2:57:58.000 --> 2:58:03.840]  Charlotte County or or any of that area down there. They've asked for them for years and
[2:58:03.840 --> 2:58:12.080]  got nothing. It happens. I used to live there. And and so I think they were military helicopters
[2:58:12.720 --> 2:58:18.640]  and they were probably manned by military people. Well, I was going to say the army admits they
[2:58:18.640 --> 2:58:23.120]  do all these chemical biological and radiological tests on people. So they'll lie to the public

[2:59:50.240 --> 3:00:06.160]  Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCM radio network.
[3:00:06.160 --> 3:00:22.560]  Well, he is a very, very busy man. I'm very honored to have him for the next 50 minutes or so.
[3:00:23.120 --> 3:00:28.320]  Dr Allen keys. He's also a ambassador. United States Department of State.
[3:00:29.760 --> 3:00:33.840]  Ronald Reagan appoints keys to the United Nations. Full ambassador.
[3:00:33.840 --> 3:00:39.040]  And he served on the staff of the National Security Council sought the Republican nomination
[3:00:39.040 --> 3:00:45.760]  for president in 96 and 2000 ran against Barack Obama for Illinois State Senate 2004 would have
[3:00:45.760 --> 3:00:51.040]  been a lot better than Mr Obama. And he warned people that Obama was going to be a radical.
[3:00:51.040 --> 3:00:55.360]  And I really respect Mr keys. But I remember hearing this a year and a half ago going, Oh,
[3:00:55.360 --> 3:00:59.600]  come on. You know, maybe he'll be bad like Clinton. Who knew he could be even worse.
[3:01:00.400 --> 3:01:03.760]  And so he's with us for the next hour. We're going to get into that government health care
[3:01:03.760 --> 3:01:10.080]  the cap and trade, the abortion, expanding funding for abortion in Asia and Africa.
[3:01:11.120 --> 3:01:19.200]  Just his eco science written by the mad scientist Holdren is his science are,
[3:01:19.200 --> 3:01:23.760]  which if anybody's a Nazi, it's him. And then these attacks on free speech saying you can't
[3:01:23.760 --> 3:01:29.600]  say socialist now it's racist. That's invoking the race card, my humble opinion. And so many issues
[3:01:29.600 --> 3:01:35.280]  today. Ambassador keys. It's really great to have you here, sir. I'm glad to be with you. Thank you.
[3:01:35.920 --> 3:01:39.520]  We're going to break in a few minutes and come back to the full audience. But what is most important
[3:01:39.520 --> 3:01:44.880]  on your mind right now? We'll come back and cover that first. Well, I think there are a couple of
[3:01:44.880 --> 3:01:49.520]  things. But the most important thing is the assault on the Constitution, which I think right now is
[3:01:49.520 --> 3:01:56.160]  epitomized in the health care proposal, which are really seeking to transform our whole way of life
[3:01:56.160 --> 3:02:02.320]  to move us from free government to totalitarian government. Well, I hardly agree with you.
[3:02:03.200 --> 3:02:08.800]  We're starting to see the establishment go from saying all the anger was staged,
[3:02:08.800 --> 3:02:13.440]  which obviously it isn't over 90% people there are angry. And most of them Democrats in many cases
[3:02:13.440 --> 3:02:19.200]  to now they're apologizing saying, okay, you're not thugs. You're not Nazis. You're not astroturf.
[3:02:19.200 --> 3:02:24.640]  Is that too little too late though? Of course it is. I think we've seen who these people really
[3:02:24.640 --> 3:02:30.800]  are. Their initial reaction was the reaction of offended rulers who are looking at you saying,
[3:02:30.800 --> 3:02:37.200]  how dare you question us. And they have begun to realize that the American people aren't yet at a
[3:02:37.200 --> 3:02:42.240]  state where they're going to act like the peasants and serfs of old. We are used to being a free
[3:02:42.240 --> 3:02:46.880]  people and that we're going to stand up and act like it, whether they like it or not.
[3:02:46.880 --> 3:02:56.080]  Absolutely. The anger is just going across the board. He lost two more approval points this
[3:02:56.080 --> 3:03:02.480]  week or three. Excuse me. He has the lowest approval of any president up to this date of
[3:03:02.480 --> 3:03:08.160]  seven months into their administration. What is he going to do to try to save his presidency?
[3:03:08.160 --> 3:03:14.560]  Do you think? Well, I think that depends. I think he came forward because of a deep ideological
[3:03:14.560 --> 3:03:19.520]  commitment. And this is what I tried to explain to people for the longest time. This man is deeply
[3:03:19.520 --> 3:03:26.160]  committed to Marxist-Leninism, to the Communist-Marxist-Socialist understanding of the world.
[3:03:27.440 --> 3:03:33.040]  In school, in associations, in background, in both in the Illinois State Senate,
[3:03:33.040 --> 3:03:39.360]  in his own activities, this has been the focus of his life. And so he is pursuing that agenda and
[3:03:39.360 --> 3:03:44.320]  surrounding himself with people committed to it. And whatever else is going on, they're not
[3:03:44.320 --> 3:03:50.400]  really going to drop it. They may have to stop for a while, but they'll probe with the bayonet.
[3:03:50.400 --> 3:03:54.800]  They've met resistance. They'll back off, but they'll keep probing, just as Lenin told them.
[3:03:56.560 --> 3:04:00.800]  That does seem to be the tactic. They'll constrict. We'll fight back and push him back
[3:04:00.800 --> 3:04:05.520]  a little bit, but it's the two steps forward, one step back. They are still going to continue to
[3:04:05.520 --> 3:04:09.600]  squeeze in your educated opinion, working internationally at the highest levels of the
[3:04:09.600 --> 3:04:14.960]  White House. When we come back after this break, how do we stop them then? How do we stop this
[3:04:14.960 --> 3:04:20.720]  incremental? Because we can get all fired up and say no, but then they always just come pushing
[3:04:20.720 --> 3:04:25.360]  back. I guess we've got to get on the offensive, and then we never back off. I mean, I guess if
[3:04:25.360 --> 3:04:30.320]  we're not on the offensive, we're on the defensive. That's right. And I think it's important to do a
[3:04:30.320 --> 3:04:37.760]  simple thing. We're not opposed to their proposals. We're opposed to them. Well, they've proven
[3:04:37.760 --> 3:04:41.920]  they're liars. I mean, you can't believe a word they say. So it's kind of like you have a neighbor
[3:04:41.920 --> 3:04:46.240]  you've caught lying to you over and over again. You just stop associating with them or even some.
[3:04:47.440 --> 3:04:53.040]  You certainly start trusting them, and I think we can trust them to continue the march to socialism.
[3:04:53.040 --> 3:04:56.560]  If we don't want it, then we have to look at another direction for leadership.
[3:04:57.840 --> 3:05:01.200]  Ambassador Keys is our guest, Alan Keys. Stay with us.
[3:05:01.200 --> 3:05:05.680]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[3:05:05.680 --> 3:05:09.840]  this summer. Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric
[3:05:09.840 --> 3:05:15.120]  bill. Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[3:05:15.120 --> 3:05:19.760]  allows you to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart
[3:05:19.760 --> 3:05:24.320]  grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is
[3:05:24.320 --> 3:05:28.400]  dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead. Number four,
[3:05:28.400 --> 3:05:32.800]  the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again. Every year, thousands of families
[3:05:32.800 --> 3:05:37.600]  lose their power from weather related outages. Number five, a solar power generator provides
[3:05:37.600 --> 3:05:42.240]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators
[3:05:42.240 --> 3:05:46.800]  offered by Solutions from Science, a long time sponsor of ours. You can get more information

[3:05:59.920 --> 3:06:05.920]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions. If you're going into a battle and
[3:06:05.920 --> 3:06:10.880]  they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want? My answer would be all
[3:06:10.880 --> 3:06:16.640]  I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones. Food is your only ammunition.
[3:06:16.640 --> 3:06:21.920]  How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the battle starts? When will you need it?
[3:06:21.920 --> 3:06:26.560]  Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children
[3:06:26.560 --> 3:06:31.200]  sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[3:06:31.200 --> 3:06:35.840]  and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[3:06:35.840 --> 3:06:41.280]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't
[3:06:41.280 --> 3:06:46.640]  know. How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones. I want all of you good guys to live
[3:06:46.640 --> 3:06:55.440]  to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[3:06:55.440 --> 3:07:04.800]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633. Did you know that it's a documented fact 80% of all Americans
[3:07:04.800 --> 3:07:10.000]  and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection?
[3:07:10.000 --> 3:07:15.040]  You may be one of millions of people suffering from one of dozens of debilitating chronic diseases
[3:07:15.040 --> 3:07:20.160]  from these parasites and your doctor would never know it. In fact, clinically detected parasites
[3:07:20.160 --> 3:07:26.000]  account for only 1% of all cases. Don't continue to suffer from pain due to misdiagnosis. Now you
[3:07:26.000 --> 3:07:31.280]  can fight internal parasites, heavy metal poisoning and high cholesterol, naturally and safely. By
[3:07:31.280 --> 3:07:37.040]  mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP, with your favorite beverage once a day.

[3:08:24.320 --> 3:08:30.000]  Logspot.com got that up on screen as we simulcast the radio show on the web,
[3:08:30.640 --> 3:08:35.040]  slash as a TV show. He also writes for Whirlwind Daily and other big publications.
[3:08:35.040 --> 3:08:40.080]  Unhealthy for Liberty is one of his latest pieces. He also has another great piece,
[3:08:40.080 --> 3:08:45.920]  Socialist Right and Left, Same Difference. And so we'll go over some of that with him today,
[3:08:45.920 --> 3:08:51.520]  a great political mind. And again, we're honored to have him joining us. Some stations just joined
[3:08:51.520 --> 3:08:59.200]  us. So I want to recap. We see the town halls, the people, Republican, Democrat, old, young,
[3:08:59.200 --> 3:09:03.760]  black, white coming out and saying, we don't want this. And they have copies of the bill.
[3:09:03.760 --> 3:09:09.120]  They have the subsections. The Democrats for three weeks tried to lie. And even some Republicans did
[3:09:09.120 --> 3:09:13.920]  and say, that's not in there. This isn't in there. Now they're having to admit all the things we said
[3:09:13.920 --> 3:09:21.920]  were in there that were in there and apologizing. How do we ensure that this resistance continues?
[3:09:21.920 --> 3:09:27.520]  Because as you just said, they're going to continue to come back probing. They put the pressure on,
[3:09:27.520 --> 3:09:34.880]  we resist, they back off. I mean, give us your battle plan of how to not just hold them off,
[3:09:34.880 --> 3:09:39.280]  but actually regain some ground because you know, Ambassador, we've lost so much liberty.
[3:09:39.280 --> 3:09:43.760]  Well, I think that we have to be clear about what it is we're opposing,
[3:09:44.640 --> 3:09:49.440]  because I think that the present overwhelming response to this health care program reminds me
[3:09:49.440 --> 3:09:55.120]  a little of what happened on the immigration bill when they were trying to destroy our sovereignty.
[3:09:56.080 --> 3:10:02.080]  You're not just looking at an opposition to specific proposals and elements. I think what
[3:10:02.080 --> 3:10:07.760]  happened is some of these things, particularly, for instance, the provisions that seem targeted
[3:10:07.760 --> 3:10:12.880]  at rationing care for the elderly, at setting up a system that would pressure people into accepting
[3:10:12.880 --> 3:10:19.840]  death and giving up therapy, side by side with provisions that might expand funding for illegal
[3:10:19.840 --> 3:10:26.320]  immigrants, which would therefore be being paid at the expense of our loved ones being encouraged
[3:10:26.320 --> 3:10:33.040]  to die. These things were rejected because they fundamentally offend conscience. They seem contrary
[3:10:33.040 --> 3:10:38.560]  to the American way of life and the understanding we have of the intrinsic worth of human beings.
[3:10:38.560 --> 3:10:42.480]  With that in mind, you look at the whole picture, there are the invasive elements
[3:10:43.040 --> 3:10:47.520]  that would take control, first of all, of the health sector, of the terms of your
[3:10:47.520 --> 3:10:53.200]  remuneration of doctors and things of this kind. So they claim that it's not aimed at phasing out
[3:10:53.200 --> 3:10:59.760]  the private sector. Two things are true. Barack Obama himself, in his early career, explicitly
[3:10:59.760 --> 3:11:07.280]  said he was for universal single payer. Then it comes out a proposal that has elements in it
[3:11:07.280 --> 3:11:11.760]  that, yes, over the course of a little time, are going to push the system in that direction.
[3:11:12.880 --> 3:11:17.840]  These elements are backed by the big corporate guys who are trying to get out from under the
[3:11:17.840 --> 3:11:21.920]  health care cost so they can have bigger profits. Are we all supposed to be stupid?
[3:11:21.920 --> 3:11:24.880]  That we don't realize what's happening? Of course, not people do realize it.
[3:11:24.880 --> 3:11:31.200]  And then you look at what's going on overseas with Canada and Great Britain, these other examples,
[3:11:31.200 --> 3:11:35.200]  and it turns out that there is rationing, there is pressure for the old people,
[3:11:35.200 --> 3:11:39.760]  there are long lines, there is poor access, there is lower quality in terms of medical
[3:11:39.760 --> 3:11:45.680]  personnel and so forth. And so the notion that everybody's going to have access is countervailed
[3:11:45.680 --> 3:11:51.280]  by the fact that they'll have access to a worse system in which they'll get worse service,
[3:11:51.280 --> 3:11:56.880]  in which they will no longer have the sense that a whole bunch of people have in America,
[3:11:56.880 --> 3:12:01.680]  that when something goes wrong with you, it's dealt with expeditiously, right? That won't even
[3:12:01.680 --> 3:12:06.000]  be there. And so I think people are looking at this saying, wait a minute, this is not America.
[3:12:06.000 --> 3:12:12.880]  This is not how we live, and we have been relying on a system that, yes, has its shortcoming.
[3:12:12.880 --> 3:12:17.680]  You know, they say that we're supposed to let government take over 100% of our lives
[3:12:17.680 --> 3:12:24.080]  because we want to care for the 10% of people who they say don't have access to some kind
[3:12:24.080 --> 3:12:28.320]  of health insurance right now. That doesn't make sense. So I think a lot of people have
[3:12:28.320 --> 3:12:34.320]  begun to suspect the truth. The aim of this is to improve health care. The aim of it is to give
[3:12:34.320 --> 3:12:40.800]  that power to government over life and death and finances and privacy and personal decisions
[3:12:40.800 --> 3:12:46.240]  so that we'll be in a position where we must hang on the decisions and words and power
[3:12:46.240 --> 3:12:52.640]  of the people in power, which gives them great control so that they can remain in power at our
[3:12:52.640 --> 3:12:57.280]  expense. That is what the totalitarian government is all about. That's what social
[3:12:57.280 --> 3:13:03.760]  and takeovers are about. They use issues in order to achieve power. They're not really interested
[3:13:03.760 --> 3:13:10.800]  in the results. Wow, Ambassador Alan Teese is our guest. Absolutely amazing how you just laid it
[3:13:10.800 --> 3:13:17.200]  all out and everything you were saying there is true because right in front of me today, ABC News
[3:13:17.200 --> 3:13:23.920]  and MSNBC and the New York Times in my stack, they spin it like it's good and they go look the big
[3:13:23.920 --> 3:13:30.640]  insurance companies, look the big doctors unions, look all these special interests are getting together
[3:13:31.520 --> 3:13:38.240]  with this $12 million ad package that the health care plan is good and really that is all it is,
[3:13:38.240 --> 3:13:44.080]  is big corporations really want it so they can then have liability protection to not give people
[3:13:44.080 --> 3:13:49.440]  the care they've already paid for. And then the Congressman Conyers says they can't read a 1300
[3:13:49.440 --> 3:13:55.120]  page bill, but the government can then implement all our health care. I mean, they can't get anything
[3:13:55.120 --> 3:14:00.240]  right, but and really they're just grabbing the whole industry for themselves. So I'd like you
[3:14:00.240 --> 3:14:06.560]  to comment on that. And then secondarily, it's come out that White House funded groups Acorn and
[3:14:06.560 --> 3:14:11.600]  others. I mean, here's the actual ad. Defend President Obama's health care plan over August
[3:14:11.600 --> 3:14:17.760]  recess $500 a week. Now is your chance to make health care work. Here they are jobs that matter.org,
[3:14:18.320 --> 3:14:25.600]  a Democratic funded group paying people and then they got caught. Obama can't plant fake document
[3:14:26.160 --> 3:14:34.160]  and Shay Guevara fan at Jackson Lee Forum and they got caught with this woman who works for this lady
[3:14:34.160 --> 3:14:38.880]  right here in the shot who works with Obama famously in the photo with her and Shay Guevara.
[3:14:39.440 --> 3:14:47.120]  And then here she is faking going to stage questioners posing as doctors saying so even the few
[3:14:47.120 --> 3:14:52.880]  people that they go to at their own town halls, it's staged ambassador. They've been accusing us
[3:14:52.880 --> 3:14:58.720]  of it being staged. They are caught staging it. Well, see, but this corresponds and I hope a lot
[3:14:58.720 --> 3:15:04.560]  of people, well, maybe a lot of people don't. But one of the standard practices of the old communists
[3:15:04.560 --> 3:15:09.840]  right in the 20th century was to accuse their opponents of doing the things that they themselves
[3:15:09.840 --> 3:15:16.160]  do routinely. And that's exactly what has been happening here. That particularly is with respect
[3:15:16.160 --> 3:15:21.920]  to these stage meetings in the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries under communism,
[3:15:21.920 --> 3:15:26.800]  under these dictators in the third world. This idea of the stage event where you pretend you
[3:15:26.800 --> 3:15:31.280]  got all kinds of public support when you're actually handpicked people to come out and do
[3:15:31.280 --> 3:15:36.320]  show trials as it were and show press conferences and all of this, that's standard practice.
[3:15:36.320 --> 3:15:41.120]  These people are simply showing themselves to be exactly what they are. A bunch of leftists
[3:15:41.120 --> 3:15:46.480]  following the handbook of the communists trying to impose this system on the people of the United
[3:15:46.480 --> 3:15:54.000]  States against our will with lies and staged manipulations of perception and so forth exactly
[3:15:54.000 --> 3:16:00.640]  as a whiskey and others have recommended to the left wingers that they do. It also, of course,
[3:16:01.520 --> 3:16:05.920]  maxed the tactics that were used during the era of the first National Socialist push,
[3:16:05.920 --> 3:16:13.360]  the right wing National Socialist, we call them Nazis, right? And they had the same kind of
[3:16:13.360 --> 3:16:19.680]  approaches for manipulating politics and practiced the same effort to vilify their opponents and
[3:16:19.680 --> 3:16:24.640]  to dehumanize them in various ways with name calling and junk like this. Just as these people
[3:16:24.640 --> 3:16:30.880]  are now trying to pretend that anybody who looks at this on the basis of the facts analyzes it in
[3:16:30.880 --> 3:16:36.880]  light of the ideology and what it's all about, calls what they're doing socialism. And you've
[3:16:36.880 --> 3:16:40.800]  had these people standing up and saying, well, it's racist. That's just a code word for race.
[3:16:40.800 --> 3:16:44.080]  What nonsense is this? Do they really think we're that stupid?
[3:16:44.080 --> 3:16:50.400]  Well, I mean, they clearly ambassador and I want your opinion on this. It's cold blooded. They know
[3:16:51.840 --> 3:16:55.680]  they took all these well-meaning people that voted for Obama. I know a lot of rednecks around
[3:16:55.680 --> 3:17:02.160]  here in Texas did to prove they weren't racist wanting to have everybody live together in peace.
[3:17:02.160 --> 3:17:06.720]  And then now cold bloodedly, these poverty pimps, these Annenberg Foundation people,
[3:17:06.720 --> 3:17:12.400]  these Ford Foundation people, knowingly come in and say, if you disagree with cap and trade,
[3:17:12.400 --> 3:17:18.400]  if you disagree with his policies on government health care, you are a racist. And I get hundreds
[3:17:18.400 --> 3:17:24.880]  of emails a week saying that I'm secretly a white supremacist because we posted the Obama
[3:17:24.880 --> 3:17:33.040]  Joker photo saying socialism. I mean, isn't that really the racism or invoking the racism as divide
[3:17:33.040 --> 3:17:39.200]  and conquer cold bloodedly? Isn't that absolutely not bad. Think about it. The whole Obama effort
[3:17:39.200 --> 3:17:46.480]  was a cold blooded invocation of race. Everything about what these people did was a cold blooded
[3:17:46.480 --> 3:17:52.880]  effort to play the race card. And that's what it was all about. And the whole idea that you should
[3:17:52.880 --> 3:17:58.240]  vote for somebody not because of the color of their skin, but because of their qualities and
[3:17:58.240 --> 3:18:02.080]  characteristics and your agreement with what they were trying to do that was right for the
[3:18:02.080 --> 3:18:08.080]  country that they threw out. And of course, now they want it thrown out because most people look
[3:18:08.080 --> 3:18:13.920]  at what he's up to realize that people like myself were not exaggerate. You had a lot of people
[3:18:13.920 --> 3:18:18.640]  said, oh, that's just extremism. You're exaggerating. No, he's not like that. His speeches are so
[3:18:18.640 --> 3:18:25.840]  moderate. But that's because as we're discovering, the man's a pathological liar. I'm sorry. He lies
[3:18:25.840 --> 3:18:31.440]  and he has studied at it. He is still full at it. He is a shrewd actor as it were that turns
[3:18:31.440 --> 3:18:38.720]  his whole person and delivery into the lie. But nonetheless, it does not correspond with the truth.
[3:18:38.720 --> 3:18:44.320]  Well, that's what I was going to say is you live in Illinois. You knew him. And I respect you. I
[3:18:44.320 --> 3:18:49.680]  interviewed you for D Magazine back in the mid 90s. I interviewed you again on radio many years ago.
[3:18:49.680 --> 3:18:55.040]  I respected you and thought that you were right. I just thought, well, keys doesn't usually have
[3:18:55.040 --> 3:19:00.480]  any rhetoric. But man, is Obama this bad? I mean, I wasn't for Obama. But I remember the speeches
[3:19:00.480 --> 3:19:05.760]  you gave in the warnings. And now it's all true. And that's what's concerning me.
[3:19:05.760 --> 3:19:10.880]  This is one of the problems I guess I have in life. I'm dealing with issues right now,
[3:19:10.880 --> 3:19:14.560]  whether it's the health care issue, the eligibility issue. People always try to pretend
[3:19:14.560 --> 3:19:20.160]  that there's some motive involved. I just try to look at things and call them as I see them.
[3:19:20.160 --> 3:19:24.800]  Based on the knowledge and experience that I've had, I try to clearly share with people
[3:19:24.800 --> 3:19:30.000]  conclusions that I think make sense. And that's what I tried to do in that case. And the facts
[3:19:30.000 --> 3:19:35.760]  were clear. And therefore, I feel that if you're a public person, you have an obligation to share
[3:19:35.760 --> 3:19:40.240]  that true understanding as best you can with the people that you're talking to.
[3:19:41.440 --> 3:19:46.240]  Well, since you gave those speeches and talked about him wanting to force abort babies,
[3:19:46.240 --> 3:19:53.200]  it's now been confirmed. Let's go over. You know this gentleman. You know who the president really
[3:19:53.200 --> 3:19:58.960]  is and who his controllers are. So let us in to your expertise on the other side. Ambassador
[3:19:58.960 --> 3:20:04.720]  Keys is our guest. Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now
[3:20:04.720 --> 3:20:09.360]  storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that in a
[3:20:09.360 --> 3:20:14.240]  real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold? It's true. Seeds
[3:20:14.240 --> 3:20:18.000]  have all performed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even
[3:20:18.000 --> 3:20:22.800]  happen again. So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of
[3:20:22.800 --> 3:20:28.880]  non-hybrid seeds. They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of
[3:20:28.880 --> 3:20:33.440]  nutrient-dense food for you and your family. And here's the best part. These seeds have not been
[3:20:33.440 --> 3:20:38.560]  genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis
[3:20:38.560 --> 3:20:45.360]  garden. So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com or give them a call
[3:20:45.360 --> 3:20:56.880]  at 877-327-0365. That's 877-327-0365. Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the
[3:20:56.880 --> 3:21:03.200]  ultimate barter item. This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com. In the New World Order's
[3:21:03.200 --> 3:21:09.600]  war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear. We've got to have a civilian national
[3:21:09.600 --> 3:21:16.880]  security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded. The Obama deception
[3:21:16.880 --> 3:21:21.840]  completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interests of the American people.
[3:21:21.840 --> 3:21:27.520]  Well, Obama's already fudging. Yeah, fudged since day one in this election. If you have a demagogue
[3:21:27.520 --> 3:21:33.120]  with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group
[3:21:33.120 --> 3:21:39.920]  of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism. It's not about left or right. It's about
[3:21:39.920 --> 3:21:47.200]  a one-world government. This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real
[3:21:47.200 --> 3:21:54.000]  agenda. Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com or download it in super

[3:22:21.200 --> 3:22:27.360]  executive order 11,110 was signed with the authority to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power
[3:22:27.360 --> 3:22:32.000]  to lend money to the United States government and interest. With the stroke of a pen, Kennedy would
[3:22:32.000 --> 3:22:36.320]  have put the Fed out of business. The November assassination quieted the production of the
[3:22:36.320 --> 3:22:42.000]  new currency. However, the executive order still stands unrepealed. Minus has the Kennedy versus

[3:24:36.560 --> 3:24:43.520]  just by typing in AlanKeys.com. A-L-A-N-K-E-Y-E-S.com. It goes to the same place. Because that's
[3:24:43.520 --> 3:24:49.760]  now become my major vehicle for sharing on a regular basis thoughts and writings of various lengths
[3:24:49.760 --> 3:24:55.200]  with people. I'm also serializing what I hope will become a couple of books that are periodically
[3:24:55.200 --> 3:25:00.880]  I'm putting chapters up on the blog there for people to look at. And so forth. I also am writing
[3:25:00.880 --> 3:25:07.280]  for World Net Daily. And I'm heavily involved in the work of America's Independent Party,
[3:25:07.280 --> 3:25:17.200]  which has a website, A-I-T News, A-I-T-N-E-W-S-A-I-P-NEWS.com, which is essentially an effort both
[3:25:17.200 --> 3:25:22.800]  to sign up people for a political effort where we're standing on common principles from the
[3:25:22.800 --> 3:25:28.000]  get-go and everybody commits to those things so that we're not going to be throwing them aside
[3:25:28.000 --> 3:25:35.200]  in order to just achieve office at any price. But it also corresponds to my view that in today's
[3:25:35.200 --> 3:25:40.800]  world, if we want to take America back, the people must become the media. We must use the
[3:25:40.800 --> 3:25:47.440]  tools that are available so we're no longer relying on the corporate bought and paid for
[3:25:47.440 --> 3:25:53.520]  media outlets that now are working for some of these big business enterprises that are
[3:25:53.520 --> 3:25:59.120]  essentially the fellow travelers of the Obama Socialist. And that more and more is happening.
[3:25:59.120 --> 3:26:04.000]  So they're openly saying with the hate crimes law and the cyber bullying that if something hurts
[3:26:04.000 --> 3:26:08.560]  someone's feelings, you're going to be federally charged. That's actually in the bills. I couldn't
[3:26:08.560 --> 3:26:14.240]  believe it. And especially the cyber bullying. So they're certainly coming after our free speech.
[3:26:14.240 --> 3:26:22.360]  They're not only saying that saying it's socialism is racist, which is incredible race
[3:26:22.360 --> 3:26:29.000]  baiting, in my opinion. And as you said, cold-bloodily using it to drive a wedge. But they're now
[3:26:29.800 --> 3:26:35.320]  calling for the arrest of people that put up Obama posters on white polls. But Obama was in
[3:26:35.320 --> 3:26:42.640]  the Washington Post telling his supporters to put up his hope sign on stop signs, which is illegal.
[3:26:42.640 --> 3:26:45.680]  So just the level of hypocrisy.
[3:26:45.680 --> 3:26:52.400]  Well, I think though it goes beyond hypocrisy, because hypocrisy would imply that that that is
[3:26:52.400 --> 3:26:59.840]  almost just a function of the circumstances of particular cases. It's not. This is the strategy
[3:26:59.840 --> 3:27:07.440]  whereby you dehumanize, demoralize, and destroy any opposition. You build up your own camps so
[3:27:07.440 --> 3:27:13.840]  that they become the exclusive, have the exclusive access, really, to public opinion. And then
[3:27:13.840 --> 3:27:21.120]  you try to mobilize the force of law and law enforcement and the state, eventually including,
[3:27:21.120 --> 3:27:27.360]  of course, arresting and trying people and throwing them into jail or camp, because they are dissenting
[3:27:27.360 --> 3:27:34.320]  from your policy. That's something that was systematically characteristic of these socialist
[3:27:34.320 --> 3:27:38.480]  regimes of the right and left, whether it's the Nazi regime or the old Soviet regime,
[3:27:38.480 --> 3:27:45.280]  these socialist regimes, all of them took this approach to politics. And, of course, they also
[3:27:45.280 --> 3:27:54.080]  adopted the famous Rahm Emanuel repeated dictum that you want to take advantage of a good crisis,
[3:27:54.080 --> 3:27:59.120]  right? And advance your agenda using it. And that, of course, includes manufacturing it,
[3:27:59.120 --> 3:28:04.000]  if you don't have one. So that if you don't have a good crisis, you make one up, you cause one.
[3:28:04.000 --> 3:28:07.360]  I think that's one of the reasons why he's so irresponsible about spending.
[3:28:07.360 --> 3:28:13.680]  He actually wants to push us deeper and deeper into a critical and desperate economic situation
[3:28:13.680 --> 3:28:20.160]  that will justify consolidating more and more power in the hands of the government that he
[3:28:20.160 --> 3:28:25.840]  controls. That's a standard practice. It just breaks my heart that because of the end of the Cold
[3:28:25.840 --> 3:28:32.160]  War, you know, when we were actively confronted by the Soviets, people were more aware on a daily
[3:28:32.160 --> 3:28:37.360]  basis of who these people were, what they did, what practices they carried forward. It was
[3:28:37.360 --> 3:28:43.280]  something that you grew up with and you understood. I think we have now had, what is it, 20, 30 years
[3:28:43.280 --> 3:28:48.320]  in which that's become less and less the case. And you have a lot of folks now who don't realize
[3:28:48.320 --> 3:28:54.240]  that what we're watching is simply part of a pattern that was common from the mid 20th century
[3:28:54.240 --> 3:29:00.880]  forward. Yeah. In case you don't know, sir, it's up on info wars.com. We have at least six different
[3:29:00.880 --> 3:29:07.920]  in English to in Spanish, Florida news reports and several of them call for my arrest. I didn't
[3:29:07.920 --> 3:29:12.960]  come up with the Obama Joker poster. I saw it in LA nationally. They said it was racist. You should
[3:29:12.960 --> 3:29:18.000]  be arrested. So I put it up on my site and I said, folks, we got to stand up at this attack on free
[3:29:18.000 --> 3:29:24.560]  speech post these in legal places everywhere. Now they're on the news calling for my arrest.
[3:29:24.560 --> 3:29:28.640]  So I can think of nothing more on American ambassador. I want to get your take on that and
[3:29:28.640 --> 3:29:33.920]  get back to the question of, you know what makes them tick? You've been proven to be right about
[3:29:33.920 --> 3:29:39.760]  them. What are they going to try next? And then I want to get into some other issues like governors
[3:29:39.760 --> 3:29:49.120]  oppose DoD emergency powers. Obama wants to put 400,000 troops on the streets of America. You
[3:29:49.120 --> 3:30:00.880]  can't make this up. We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[3:30:00.880 --> 3:30:05.520]  Hello, friends. This is Alex Jones. And I want each of you to ask yourself this question. Do you
[3:30:05.520 --> 3:30:10.880]  really know what's in your tap water? In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor,
[3:30:10.880 --> 3:30:16.000]  they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water. Many
[3:30:16.000 --> 3:30:20.480]  of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune and developmental system
[3:30:20.480 --> 3:30:25.920]  diseases. Now what are you going to do about it? The Acola blue atmospheric water generator is a
[3:30:25.920 --> 3:30:30.960]  low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water. The Acola blue 28

[3:33:51.280 --> 3:33:55.440]  And it doesn't come out of the tap. There's no fluoride, nothing in it. And then it goes
[3:33:55.440 --> 3:34:04.000]  through seven filters. AcolaBlue.com or 800-691643, 800-691643. And I remember years ago listening
[3:34:04.000 --> 3:34:09.760]  to Mr. Kees' radio show, so informed. We didn't do that anymore, but he's all over talk radio and
[3:34:09.760 --> 3:34:15.920]  TV and we always enjoy having him. And he got arrested. You could be there pro abortion. You
[3:34:15.920 --> 3:34:20.160]  just, you just couldn't be against it. We're going to talk about that coming up in a few minutes.
[3:34:21.280 --> 3:34:28.880]  But, sir, continue with the free speech issue. How can you put up signs with Bush as the Joker,
[3:34:28.880 --> 3:34:32.880]  Bush as a vampire? And I wasn't a fan of Bush tripling the size of government. Now,
[3:34:32.880 --> 3:34:37.280]  Obama's tripled it in seven, eight months, though, so he obviously even worse. I didn't know that was
[3:34:37.280 --> 3:34:44.400]  possible. How do you, how do these people, in fact, take the village voice, they put out Bush
[3:34:44.400 --> 3:34:49.840]  as the vampire, killing the Statue of Liberty, drinking his blood. The very artist came out
[3:34:49.840 --> 3:34:57.520]  and said, no, it's okay to show Bush bad, but because Obama is partially African, you are not
[3:34:57.520 --> 3:35:02.640]  allowed to. I mean, it's just they're, they are, they got so much bravada. They're just so
[3:35:02.640 --> 3:35:09.680]  incredibly arrogant and, and, and just so over the top, they have no shame. Can you comment
[3:35:09.680 --> 3:35:14.640]  on what makes them tick and the attacks on your free speech? Well, first of all, I think it's
[3:35:14.640 --> 3:35:20.640]  purely ideological. These people come from a point of view, uh, which basically says whatever we say
[3:35:20.640 --> 3:35:26.080]  goes, if we do it, then it's acceptable. If our opponents do it, then it's unacceptable. And you
[3:35:26.080 --> 3:35:31.520]  make them suffer for what they do in whatever way you can, because there is no such thing
[3:35:31.520 --> 3:35:36.480]  as a standard of truth. That's the most important thing to keep in mind when listening to their
[3:35:36.480 --> 3:35:41.440]  words and everything, the ordinary notion that you are trying to speak the truth and make sense,
[3:35:41.440 --> 3:35:46.640]  and that you have respect for some standard of reasonableness and common sense and logic and
[3:35:46.640 --> 3:35:52.880]  factuality, none of it applies to them as it did not apply to the people who edited pravada, uh,
[3:35:52.880 --> 3:35:57.520]  in the old Soviet Union, as it never applies, uh, to, did not apply to the gerbil's
[3:35:57.520 --> 3:36:04.000]  propagandist under the Nazis. These people aren't about speaking the truth. They are simply about
[3:36:04.000 --> 3:36:11.360]  imposing their will by manipulating people's minds, by cutting off others so that they won't
[3:36:11.360 --> 3:36:16.880]  have access, won't be able to make arguments, uh, and only allowing their voice and their
[3:36:16.880 --> 3:36:21.600]  understanding and their interpretation to be heard. Uh, and they are moving forward to implement
[3:36:21.600 --> 3:36:28.000]  that understanding, uh, which of course is contrary to everything that Americans, uh, have professed
[3:36:28.000 --> 3:36:33.760]  to believe over the course of pretty much our entire history, uh, since that notion, uh, of free
[3:36:33.760 --> 3:36:40.320]  and open and sometimes even raucous discussion and debate, uh, has been a hallmark of what our
[3:36:40.320 --> 3:36:47.520]  society is all about, but now that's being thrown away. And Masseter specifically, you've grown up,
[3:36:47.520 --> 3:36:52.560]  lived in Illinois. You, you know him as a state senator, as a U S senator, you're aware of his
[3:36:52.560 --> 3:36:58.160]  activities. So can you give us a snapshot of him because, because I mean specifically, here's the
[3:36:58.160 --> 3:37:03.040]  question though, even if you agree with his policies or disagree, I've never seen one this
[3:37:03.040 --> 3:37:08.880]  flagrantly or slickly lie. He makes Clinton look like a poor liar. He's a great actor. He should
[3:37:08.880 --> 3:37:13.760]  be in Hollywood because he gets up and says, I will have no lobbyist anywhere. They will not
[3:37:13.760 --> 3:37:18.640]  write the laws. He hires more than anybody ever has. He says, I'll have total transparency.
[3:37:18.640 --> 3:37:23.760]  He keeps all of Cheney's secrecy and more and then even makes it secret who comes to the White
[3:37:23.760 --> 3:37:28.880]  House where you even worked taking it to a new level. So can you comment on knowing who he really
[3:37:28.880 --> 3:37:37.280]  is and how he seems to enjoy lying and can one of the few people I've seen who can lie and it
[3:37:37.280 --> 3:37:43.600]  looks like he's telling the truth. Well, first of all, I don't want to pretend. One, I did not grow up
[3:37:43.600 --> 3:37:49.760]  in Illinois. You know, I ran there, but I ran there on invitation. Okay, well, I misunderstood
[3:37:49.760 --> 3:37:55.760]  that. But you're in Illinois. So how do you know him? How do you know him? I learned about
[3:37:55.760 --> 3:38:02.960]  Barack Obama as I was engaging in the preparations and carrying out of that campaign effort. It is
[3:38:02.960 --> 3:38:08.080]  not a personal thing and I never pretend that I have some, you know, special personal slant on
[3:38:08.080 --> 3:38:13.360]  Barack Obama. I don't know about that. What I do know, I know from facts, from the positions he's
[3:38:13.360 --> 3:38:19.680]  taken and from the facts that one can garner and that are now being shared more on the internet
[3:38:19.680 --> 3:38:26.800]  and elsewhere, but that were hidden from the American people because media clack of the Obama
[3:38:26.800 --> 3:38:32.560]  faction, the people who are kind of stupefied by their zealous support of Obama, did not share
[3:38:32.560 --> 3:38:38.320]  these facts with the American people. And so they were promoting a false understanding. So in a sense,
[3:38:38.320 --> 3:38:43.360]  I came at Barack Obama from an objective point of view, not from a point of view of any kind of
[3:38:43.360 --> 3:38:48.400]  special knowledge or animus of any kind. I like a lot of Americans. I didn't even know him from
[3:38:48.400 --> 3:38:53.120]  Adam. All right, let me just stop you. Let me just stop you. I just figured that you were a little
[3:38:53.120 --> 3:38:58.320]  state senator that nobody had ever heard of until he started being pushed. And what's interesting
[3:38:58.320 --> 3:39:04.240]  is when you get to know more about his background, there were forces that were obviously helping to
[3:39:04.240 --> 3:39:08.640]  move him along. There are questions about who funded his education and all of these kinds of
[3:39:08.640 --> 3:39:13.440]  things. It looked like somebody had it in mind to prepare him for us, even though they weren't
[3:39:13.440 --> 3:39:18.720]  preparing us for him. Okay, well, I apologize for my ignorance. I figured that you were running in
[3:39:18.720 --> 3:39:23.360]  Illinois. And since you knew, I mean, I remember seeing you a year and a half, two years ago,
[3:39:23.360 --> 3:39:29.600]  speeches on YouTube, hearing you on the radio, you were so accurate about him. I was just guessing
[3:39:29.600 --> 3:39:34.160]  that you must have been in and around him in politics. But I guess you just had a crash course
[3:39:34.160 --> 3:39:39.200]  and research when you saw him being pushed and propelled by all these special interests.
[3:39:39.200 --> 3:39:44.480]  Sometimes, sometimes you can be accurate simply because you bring an objective state of mind to
[3:39:44.480 --> 3:39:51.120]  the past and are willing to let them instruct you. And that, I guess, is all I can claim in terms of
[3:39:51.120 --> 3:39:55.600]  any understanding. Okay, good. Break down then, break down then who he really is and what he would
[3:39:55.600 --> 3:40:01.200]  like to do if we weren't blocking him right now. What would Barack Obama be doing? Who is he?
[3:40:01.760 --> 3:40:07.360]  Well, I think Barack Obama wants, and at the very least, to impose a Chavez-style socialism
[3:40:08.160 --> 3:40:14.000]  on the United States and to do so in a way that alters our Constitution. He has no respect for
[3:40:14.000 --> 3:40:19.840]  the Constitution, believes that the whole idea of limited government constrains the government
[3:40:19.840 --> 3:40:25.040]  from doing what the elitists think is good and interferes with their freedom of action.
[3:40:25.040 --> 3:40:31.280]  And therefore, he wants to throw it out the window. They also seem to believe in what you might call
[3:40:32.560 --> 3:40:37.120]  majority tyranny, so that if you win an election, you then have license to do whatever you want
[3:40:37.120 --> 3:40:42.960]  and no longer have to pay any attention to individual rights, to the rights of the minority
[3:40:42.960 --> 3:40:49.040]  group of voters that don't support the things you're doing, all of that overthrow. The patterns
[3:40:49.040 --> 3:40:54.400]  are patterns that we see in contemporary life with somebody like Chavez, and they're patterns
[3:40:54.400 --> 3:41:00.640]  that we have seen in the past, as I've been saying, with these other socialist regimes. So none of it
[3:41:00.640 --> 3:41:06.800]  in that respect is surprising. And he just seems to be cut from an ideological cloth that came from
[3:41:06.800 --> 3:41:13.200]  his background, his association with people like Bill Ayers, his instruction in the approaches
[3:41:13.200 --> 3:41:19.680]  of folks like Saul Alinsky, his preference for Marxist-Leninist teachers and instructors who,
[3:41:19.680 --> 3:41:24.720]  among other things, have shared with him that understanding of the world which devalues the
[3:41:24.720 --> 3:41:31.280]  individual and which lifts up the notion that individuals are no different than stones or rocks
[3:41:31.280 --> 3:41:38.960]  or any other material things and should be arranged and ordered by the will of the ruler,
[3:41:38.960 --> 3:41:45.200]  so that their ideas and understanding of what is right for this society can be carried out.
[3:41:45.200 --> 3:41:50.400]  The whole moral understanding that puts an intrinsic value on individuals that started
[3:41:50.400 --> 3:41:56.400]  with our Declaration of Independence, he also rejects. And once you realize that you're dealing
[3:41:56.400 --> 3:42:04.720]  with somebody whose moral universe has rejected the fundamental premises of liberty that most
[3:42:04.720 --> 3:42:10.240]  Americans kind of take for granted, even when they can't fully articulate them, then you are a
[3:42:10.240 --> 3:42:15.360]  long way toward understanding what he's about. And what does he want to do? He wants to impose
[3:42:15.360 --> 3:42:20.800]  that kind of controlling socialist government on the United States. Does he think it's going
[3:42:20.800 --> 3:42:27.920]  to do us good? I imagine so, but I've got to tell you, when you see somebody so unwilling to look
[3:42:27.920 --> 3:42:33.760]  at the factual truth, and a lot of these leftists are and have been for the whole of my lifetime,
[3:42:33.760 --> 3:42:40.080]  but you have to wonder whether they haven't completely surrendered to the fervor of their
[3:42:40.080 --> 3:42:45.040]  ideology in a way that makes their good intentions worthless because they're not willing to discipline
[3:42:45.040 --> 3:42:48.720]  those intentions with the discipline of common sense and reason and truth.
[3:42:51.040 --> 3:42:57.200]  Amazing points. Dealing with lying, though, you worked in the White House with Ronald Reagan,
[3:42:57.200 --> 3:43:03.440]  and even if you disagreed with him or loved him or hated him, Reagan didn't do a lot of lying.
[3:43:03.440 --> 3:43:12.160]  I mean, he really was honest, and his policies were very transparent. In fact, there wasn't any
[3:43:12.160 --> 3:43:18.560]  lying, as much I can tell, which is universes away from Clinton. Bush certainly did some deceptive
[3:43:18.560 --> 3:43:23.280]  things, but Obama, I mean, you've been around presidents, you've been an ambassador, you've
[3:43:23.280 --> 3:43:27.920]  been in these campaigns. Is it safe to say, or would you disagree with my perspective,
[3:43:27.920 --> 3:43:33.920]  that he is the greatest liar I've ever seen, a new level of lying? I mean, I've read books about
[3:43:33.920 --> 3:43:40.560]  Hitler. I've read books about other people. It seems that Obama is really the slickest liar
[3:43:40.560 --> 3:43:47.680]  I've ever seen. I'm not sure. I think part of the reason he appears though right now is because
[3:43:47.680 --> 3:43:54.080]  the mass of the American people kind of aren't used to having to assume that the person they're
[3:43:54.080 --> 3:44:00.640]  dealing with is, how can I put it? Not just lying, they are constructing a fiction and
[3:44:00.640 --> 3:44:06.800]  intending that fiction to manipulate you. So, in a sense, when we sit down and watch a TV show,
[3:44:06.800 --> 3:44:12.560]  right, we are drawn into the world. We accept the characterization, we accept the assumptions,
[3:44:12.560 --> 3:44:17.520]  and so forth and so on, but they call this suspension of disbelief. Now, at one level,
[3:44:17.520 --> 3:44:22.640]  everything we're watching is false. Those people aren't really who they're pretending to be.
[3:44:22.640 --> 3:44:28.240]  Their inflections and tones do not reflect feelings they really have, and so forth and so on.
[3:44:28.240 --> 3:44:33.680]  And yet, because they're good at what they do, we accept it and are drawn into that world.
[3:44:33.680 --> 3:44:40.080]  Well, imagine that you're dealing with people for whom every aspect of public life is that kind of
[3:44:40.640 --> 3:44:47.840]  acted out fiction. They're pursuing their objective, and they just want to get you to come in and
[3:44:47.840 --> 3:44:54.640]  believe the world is what it needs to be so that they can achieve their power, achieve their objective,
[3:44:55.200 --> 3:44:59.360]  achieve what they want to achieve. That's Barack Obama. And to say he's great as I,
[3:44:59.360 --> 3:45:06.400]  but it's just that we're not used to having such thorough-growing actors with no respect for truth
[3:45:06.400 --> 3:45:11.200]  in American politics. Yeah, we're used to liars, people lie, but underlying it all,
[3:45:11.200 --> 3:45:16.240]  there's been this assumption that the aim somehow is still to respect the truth.
[3:45:16.240 --> 3:45:19.360]  That's not the case with these folks, because they don't believe it anymore.
[3:45:19.360 --> 3:45:25.520]  You know, the notion of the self-evident truth that established our right that show clearly
[3:45:25.520 --> 3:45:30.880]  that justice somehow has a basis that isn't just based on the power of those who rule over you.
[3:45:30.880 --> 3:45:39.600]  They reject all of that. And I think right now, very striking to it, because Americans kind of
[3:45:39.600 --> 3:45:45.360]  have had the luxury of taking it for granted that overall, this is not what American life
[3:45:45.360 --> 3:45:53.200]  and politics was about. But now we're having to deal with a very real fact that this way of doing
[3:45:53.200 --> 3:45:58.320]  politics, which overtook Europe, which overtook countries in the third world, and which radically
[3:45:58.320 --> 3:46:04.560]  transformed those countries into gulags and hellish places of oppression, it has now come to America.
[3:46:05.440 --> 3:46:10.720]  Wow, you know what, I rarely have epiphanies these days from guest. I mean, I get a lot of
[3:46:10.720 --> 3:46:15.840]  good points, a lot of good ideas, but you just actually shifted my perspective. I mean, I know
[3:46:15.840 --> 3:46:21.040]  it's a matrix. I know it's a facade, a wizard of Oz live, but the way you just explained it,
[3:46:21.040 --> 3:46:27.120]  you're right. It's that the mainstream media and the system is playing to his tune
[3:46:27.840 --> 3:46:35.920]  with such choreographed precision that it creates a whole Disneyland of lies.
[3:46:35.920 --> 3:46:38.880]  So it's not just Bill Clinton saying, I didn't have sex with that woman or
[3:46:38.880 --> 3:46:44.480]  lying about, you know, corruption. It's that the whole thing's a lie.
[3:46:45.520 --> 3:46:52.640]  Well, exactly. They are creating, as it were, a perceived reality that serves their purposes.
[3:46:53.280 --> 3:46:57.840]  And of course, the ground started to be laid for this years ago when these people started that
[3:46:57.840 --> 3:47:04.240]  phony mantra, perception is reality, perception is reality. This is not true. Not if God exists,
[3:47:04.240 --> 3:47:09.760]  at least, because there is a principle of reality that transcends human perception and
[3:47:09.760 --> 3:47:16.800]  understanding. And it's the basis for making real judgments in a rational way about what is right,
[3:47:16.800 --> 3:47:22.080]  what is wrong, what should or should not be done. They rejected that notion of having such a basis
[3:47:22.080 --> 3:47:27.760]  for morality. And the only standard they claim is a scientific one. But of course, remember,
[3:47:27.760 --> 3:47:34.080]  science cannot tell us anything about what is right and what is wrong, what is just,
[3:47:34.080 --> 3:47:37.200]  what is undefined. Science can't address that in any way.
[3:47:37.200 --> 3:47:40.800]  Sir, we've got limited time. We've got about 12 minutes left. And I'm even going to skip
[3:47:40.800 --> 3:47:44.000]  this network break so we have this time with you because I've got several other questions I want
[3:47:44.000 --> 3:47:47.840]  to get to and certainly have you back up in the near future. Very honored to have Ambassador
[3:47:47.840 --> 3:47:55.760]  Allen Keyes on with us today. Very thought-provoking. Especially, perception isn't reality. If the
[3:47:55.760 --> 3:48:00.800]  person giving you the perception is putting false data in or lying or distorting, I mean,
[3:48:00.800 --> 3:48:07.280]  if you're wearing a headset of virtual reality goggles and you see a flat green field you're
[3:48:07.280 --> 3:48:11.520]  walking in, but really you're about to walk off a hundred-story building, you're going to fall
[3:48:11.520 --> 3:48:16.720]  and die, the goggles are lying to you. Perception isn't reality, but that was just me backing you
[3:48:16.720 --> 3:48:20.800]  up there. Think of it, think of it. This is exactly what they were trying to do with this
[3:48:20.800 --> 3:48:25.280]  healthcare business. Sell it on the basis that we're going to give everybody access. It's going to be
[3:48:25.280 --> 3:48:28.720]  better and it's going to be less costly and all of this. And then when you started to get
[3:48:28.720 --> 3:48:33.600]  into the detail, it wasn't actually less costly. They were just going to shift the distribution
[3:48:33.600 --> 3:48:39.600]  of the cost so that the elderly citizens and so forth were going to be targeted in particular
[3:48:40.240 --> 3:48:46.240]  for rationing so that those costs could be distributed differently. They said,
[3:48:46.240 --> 3:48:51.600]  well, everybody's going to have access and so forth, but the burden of paying for that suddenly
[3:48:51.600 --> 3:48:56.560]  shifted so that instead of coming out of the corporate profit, it will now come out of the
[3:48:56.560 --> 3:49:02.880]  taxpayer coffers. What does that mean? It means that, indisibly and quietly, the working people
[3:49:02.880 --> 3:49:09.840]  are being made to pay for what they were not paying for in terms of the present arrangement.
[3:49:09.840 --> 3:49:16.880]  And the government's got a whole new tax to pull out of your paycheck. Now, we've got 10 minutes
[3:49:16.880 --> 3:49:21.600]  left here. I want to ask you quick questions now. Eugenics from my research ambassador
[3:49:22.320 --> 3:49:27.600]  is the foundation of these control freaks. They believe we're all just blobs of protoplasm,
[3:49:27.600 --> 3:49:32.560]  so why not get rid of 80% of us? United Nations Biological Diversity Assessment 96,
[3:49:32.560 --> 3:49:41.520]  State Department memorandum 200, Eric Holder, all these other people. John P. Holdren,
[3:49:41.520 --> 3:49:46.560]  John P. Holdren, EcoScience, Population Resources Environment calls for force,
[3:49:46.560 --> 3:49:52.560]  drugging the water to sterilizes, forced abortion, CPS taking basically all children,
[3:49:52.560 --> 3:49:56.640]  raising them in government hives. And I have all these other government textbooks, and you're
[3:49:56.640 --> 3:50:01.440]  a learned person, you're aware of this, exposing the whole abortion agenda, which is only one
[3:50:01.440 --> 3:50:07.040]  level. And then he unfreezes the money for forced abortion. And you know, they say, oh,
[3:50:07.040 --> 3:50:13.920]  you'll get the welfare in Africa, but we've got to sterilize you. Can you speak to John P. Holdren
[3:50:13.920 --> 3:50:20.800]  and the whole Eugenics situation and what Margaret Sanger and the whole abortion industry really is?
[3:50:21.520 --> 3:50:26.480]  Well, this is one of those things that was one of the reasons I had been so
[3:50:26.480 --> 3:50:33.520]  clear about his absolute adamant commitment to this whole abortion thing, so to be carried
[3:50:33.520 --> 3:50:38.480]  as far as saying that babies born alive should be allowed to die because their mother's one
[3:50:38.480 --> 3:50:44.320]  is unaborted. That is a reflection of what you're talking about. Sometimes people think this is
[3:50:44.320 --> 3:50:50.880]  just about the specific particular murder of that baby that the abortion itself involves. No,
[3:50:50.880 --> 3:50:56.240]  you look at Margaret Sanger, that woman was about a strategy based on Eugenics for basically
[3:50:56.240 --> 3:51:02.160]  cleansing the world of the inferior people. It is an inherently elitist understanding that
[3:51:02.160 --> 3:51:08.160]  sees no value or intrinsic worth except in those lives that stand up to the measuring rod of these
[3:51:08.160 --> 3:51:15.120]  elitists and somehow valuable to the human kind. In one respect, it turns out that as the left
[3:51:15.120 --> 3:51:20.720]  wingers move down this road, they are implementing a dehumanizing understanding. But instead of
[3:51:20.720 --> 3:51:26.960]  dehumanizing people based on the racist notions of somebody like Hitler and the things that were
[3:51:26.960 --> 3:51:33.040]  being portrayed in Germany, they dehumanize people based on the scientific understanding that
[3:51:33.040 --> 3:51:38.800]  there's nothing essentially human about us, that we are in that sense just blobs of flesh and
[3:51:38.800 --> 3:51:44.000]  chemicals and junk that can be manipulated like any other physical thing. And that of course means
[3:51:44.000 --> 3:51:49.120]  that there's no boundaries whatsoever that you have to respect except the whimsical boundaries
[3:51:49.120 --> 3:51:54.320]  of personal attachment so that if you're part of the favorite clique, you might be treated
[3:51:54.320 --> 3:51:59.360]  differently. That's the world they're pushing us for. And abortion was essentially the cutting
[3:51:59.360 --> 3:52:06.000]  edge to get people implicated in a moral understanding that's destroyed our steps,
[3:52:06.000 --> 3:52:11.760]  that humanity and every single human being have a moral worth that must be respected
[3:52:11.760 --> 3:52:16.480]  by the power of government that can't be disregarded on the basis of some elitist
[3:52:16.480 --> 3:52:21.360]  measuring rods of who's worth having around and who can be killed with impunity.
[3:52:23.040 --> 3:52:30.400]  Isn't this really the religion of control freaks on power trips where Peter Singer says
[3:52:30.400 --> 3:52:36.160]  let parents kill their babies for a year after they're born, get rid of the old people,
[3:52:36.160 --> 3:52:41.680]  they've got the same value as mackerel. I mean, these are quotes saying an old person has the
[3:52:41.680 --> 3:52:49.040]  same value as a fish, that a retarded child needs to be killed. And I found they really are the
[3:52:49.040 --> 3:52:56.800]  ultimate racist as Margaret Singer wrote in her own letters to W. D. B. Du Bois. She said,
[3:52:56.800 --> 3:53:02.800]  I've got to hire black men to be my fronts to get rid of these black weeds. In my research,
[3:53:02.800 --> 3:53:09.440]  I found that the real racist, the real Nazis always cloak themselves as liberals and that
[3:53:09.440 --> 3:53:14.320]  it's even more than that. It's not just some pseudoscience and their excuse to play God,
[3:53:14.320 --> 3:53:21.520]  that they ratherlessly enjoy going after Asians, Africans, Latin Americans, poor people. It doesn't
[3:53:21.520 --> 3:53:28.160]  matter. And that they even have people of color in their ranks who enjoy this.
[3:53:29.280 --> 3:53:34.320]  Well, you know, the sad thing is, underlying it all, there is an element of what I call
[3:53:34.320 --> 3:53:41.200]  self-worship involved in this, that is involved in the fascination these elites have for themselves
[3:53:41.200 --> 3:53:46.160]  and their own power and the confirmation they see when they enjoy a little success that some
[3:53:46.160 --> 3:53:50.240]  of them are better than everybody else. That even, by the way, accounts for their so-called
[3:53:50.240 --> 3:53:57.760]  compassion because it affirms their superiority to see themselves from a height helping the
[3:53:57.760 --> 3:54:03.360]  downtrodden who, because of their inferiority, couldn't do as well and so forth and so on.
[3:54:03.360 --> 3:54:10.880]  But remember, that kind of self-worship has an implication that goes to the very heart of religion
[3:54:10.880 --> 3:54:17.920]  and faith and spirituality because it denies that there is anything other than themselves
[3:54:18.720 --> 3:54:25.200]  that is worthy of that kind of real reverence. And so it is premised at the end of the day
[3:54:25.200 --> 3:54:31.120]  on the vanishing of God from the consciousness of human beings. And that's why people like myself
[3:54:31.120 --> 3:54:36.240]  will put a great stress on the American Declaration on the fact that our unalienable rights come from
[3:54:36.240 --> 3:54:45.280]  the hand of Almighty God. We are their deep enemy because we will not let people forget the existence
[3:54:45.280 --> 3:54:51.040]  of God and the fact that most of us accept that and believe it. Well, Ambassador, when you read,
[3:54:51.040 --> 3:54:57.680]  as I know you have, is being in all these futurist and transhumanist and neo-eugenicist
[3:54:57.680 --> 3:55:04.960]  that just fill the government ranks, the Dr. Piankas and the Holdrens and Erlichs,
[3:55:04.960 --> 3:55:09.280]  they actually believe they're God. In the BBC, there was a report last year where they said,
[3:55:09.280 --> 3:55:14.640]  we're going to split off and be an elite species of the government planner, and then all the rest
[3:55:14.640 --> 3:55:18.640]  of you are the subhumans. I mean, you're right. But it's not just that they don't want to say God
[3:55:18.640 --> 3:55:24.240]  doesn't exist. They're saying, I am God. Well, you see, but I think that's a return to something
[3:55:24.240 --> 3:55:33.520]  quite old in terms of human injustice. Remember that when the people of the world were subjected
[3:55:33.520 --> 3:55:39.280]  to these old oligarchic aristocratic regimes, you know, the nobles and the peasantry and all of this,
[3:55:40.080 --> 3:55:47.360]  the midst of the time were centered on apotheosis. That is where the elite, because of their success
[3:55:47.360 --> 3:55:53.360]  and achievements and greatness, they are elevated to the status of God. That happened to the Caesar.
[3:55:53.360 --> 3:55:58.720]  That happened to others. The aim, therefore, in that pagan understanding was for these people to
[3:55:58.720 --> 3:56:06.000]  transform themselves to God-like status. And all we're seeing is the return of that age-old
[3:56:06.000 --> 3:56:12.960]  chivalrous, now being used once again to impose the idea of some kind of inherent superiority
[3:56:12.960 --> 3:56:16.960]  of these elites upon people whom they intend to en masse to oppress.
[3:56:16.960 --> 3:56:24.880]  That's amazing. Ambassador, we've got to have you back up on this subject. Last question. Governors opposed DoD emergency powers.
[3:56:24.880 --> 3:56:30.640]  That's from the Hill newspaper in D.C., as you know. Congressman could use pandemic to declare
[3:56:30.640 --> 3:56:35.840]  martial law. Congressman told the Louisville Journal. Congressman Paul Brown said they may
[3:56:35.840 --> 3:56:42.160]  use it to declare martial law as a cover for Obama because his agenda. Pentagon wants authority to
[3:56:42.160 --> 3:56:51.200]  oppose 400,000 military personnel in the U.S. I mean, this is unbelievable. And we now hear Obama
[3:56:51.200 --> 3:56:57.200]  saying terrorist, right-wing terrorist in the Southern Property Law Center and the DoD documents
[3:56:57.200 --> 3:57:02.560]  in the Justice Department, Homeland Security veterans and gun owners and Ron Paul supporters
[3:57:02.560 --> 3:57:07.680]  or terrorists. In the last two minutes, can you comment on that and are you concerned that Obama may
[3:57:07.680 --> 3:57:13.840]  stage crises, as Michael Savage and others have said? Well, I think we're seeing again a reliable
[3:57:13.840 --> 3:57:20.480]  pattern that was there in the 20th century version of this imposition of communism, the blurring of
[3:57:20.480 --> 3:57:27.040]  the distinction between the military and law enforcement, the destruction of the idea that
[3:57:27.040 --> 3:57:31.200]  human beings have individual rights. Instead, there's some national security threat that
[3:57:31.200 --> 3:57:38.720]  overrides those rights and justifies making use of any kind of action against individuals
[3:57:38.720 --> 3:57:44.560]  if you can put them in a category as a national security threat. I warned against this for many
[3:57:44.560 --> 3:57:50.160]  years and we are now seeing it brought to full fruition. And finally, I think there is the
[3:57:50.160 --> 3:57:56.320]  mentality that we now know was there, for instance, with the Nazis. The famous turning point in terms
[3:57:56.320 --> 3:58:01.680]  of the consolidation of Hitler's power was the burning of the Reichstag, which they blamed on
[3:58:01.680 --> 3:58:06.560]  the communists and leftists and those who were opposing what Hitler was trying to do and what
[3:58:06.560 --> 3:58:11.520]  we now know from the historical record they did it themselves. They burned down the Reichstag
[3:58:11.520 --> 3:58:18.000]  in order to provoke the excuse that allowed them to impose that totalitarian control and
[3:58:18.000 --> 3:58:23.760]  consolidated completely over Germany. I think that we're watching a repetition of this pattern
[3:58:23.760 --> 3:58:30.000]  and we need to wake up and we need to use those tools we still have available as Americans
[3:58:30.000 --> 3:58:35.520]  to stop it from happening. Amazing, Ambassador Allen Keyes. I look forward to having you back
[3:58:35.520 --> 3:58:42.400]  up. The website is loyal to liberty.blogspot.com. Thank you so much, sir. Glad to be with you.
[3:58:42.400 --> 3:58:48.560]  Thanks for having me. Thank you, sir. Thank you for listening to GCN. Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[3:58:48.560 --> 3:58:56.000]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[3:58:56.000 --> 3:59:00.640]  this summer. Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[3:59:00.640 --> 3:59:05.920]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[3:59:05.920 --> 3:59:11.040]  to have. It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[3:59:11.040 --> 3:59:15.840]  is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded,
[3:59:15.840 --> 3:59:20.000]  especially with the high demand summer months ahead. Number four, the hurricane and dangerous
[3:59:20.000 --> 3:59:24.160]  summer storm season is here again. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from
[3:59:24.160 --> 3:59:29.200]  weather related outages. Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance
[3:59:29.200 --> 3:59:33.680]  in peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from
[3:59:33.680 --> 3:59:40.480]  Science, a long time sponsor of ours. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
