[00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:06.391]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.391 --> 00:00:08.151]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.151 --> 00:00:09.332]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.332 --> 00:00:11.492]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.492 --> 00:00:13.033]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.033 --> 00:00:17.234]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.234 --> 00:00:21.295]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.218 --> 00:00:30.724]  The whole world is looking right now at what has happened in the elections here in the United States.
[00:00:30.724 --> 00:00:38.773]  The Republicans have clearly won 63 seats, the biggest sweep in over 70 years in the House of Representatives.
[00:00:38.773 --> 00:00:42.136]  Looks like they're going to get 8 seats in the Senate, not enough to take the Senate back.
[00:00:42.977 --> 00:00:45.758]  Biggest sweep ever for Republicans in governorships.
[00:00:45.758 --> 00:00:56.440]  They've gained at least 10 and so 30 of the governorships are now Republican as the state's rights movement accelerates.
[00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:03.242]  I'm going to cover all the different angles including election fraud, clear election fraud in Nevada and other states today.
[00:01:03.242 --> 00:01:07.963]  What happened with Rand Paul, the Federal Reserve's big announcement coming up at
[00:01:09.185 --> 00:01:12.348]  One-fifteen Central today, two-fifteen Eastern.
[00:01:12.348 --> 00:01:14.450]  We'll be covering it live.
[00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:26.481]  They've already telegraphed in the last two weeks that they are going to start fifty to a hundred billion dollars of quantitative or monetization of debt, quantitative easing, QE2.
[00:01:26.481 --> 00:01:28.182]  That's where they start buying the U.S.
[00:01:28.182 --> 00:01:30.664]  Treasury bonds, becoming the biggest owner of our debt.
[00:01:31.365 --> 00:01:31.886]  You gotta love it.
[00:01:31.886 --> 00:01:37.992]  They set the policy to get us in debt and then they own the debt and own our country along with the communist Chinese.
[00:01:37.992 --> 00:01:47.783]  And I forgot to play that banned ad yesterday by the Citizens Group against all this government spending.
[00:01:48.624 --> 00:01:55.667]  So that's going to be coming up as well, because it illustrates where we're going with the Communist Chinese and the private federal reserves.
[00:01:55.667 --> 00:02:02.310]  We'll be covering that big announcement coming up in about two hours and 15 minutes from now.
[00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:12.714]  The big story that we're going to be covering later in the hour is up on PrisonPlanet.com, written by Paul Joseph Watson and yours truly, Did Harry Reid Steal Nevada?
[00:02:14.375 --> 00:02:15.276]  Evidence is clear.
[00:02:15.276 --> 00:02:18.077]  Yes, his minions did.
[00:02:18.077 --> 00:02:39.909]  Five-point margin of victory, highly suspicious given pre-election polls showing Sharon Engel ahead, combined with reports of vote-flipping on machines for Harry Reid, controlled by Reid's son, he directly controlled it as the election official in the main county where most of the votes were cast, and serviced by corrupt pro-Reid union.
[00:02:40.894 --> 00:02:54.282]  So just amazing, and I predicted that we would see chicanery going on in Nevada, and our nonpartisan analyst will be joining us today or tomorrow, perhaps both days.
[00:02:54.282 --> 00:03:01.467]  That of course is Bev Harris, so she was really watching fraud in different parts of the country, but she focused in on Nevada.
[00:03:01.467 --> 00:03:02.768]  By the way, she's a Democrat.
[00:03:03.368 --> 00:03:03.448]  Yes.
[00:03:19.798 --> 00:03:24.120]  In her capitulation speech, she didn't talk about investigating fraud.
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.903]  So that is bad news because when there's evidence of fraud, you've got to investigate it.
[00:03:28.903 --> 00:03:30.844]  There was evidence of fraud in 2000.
[00:03:30.844 --> 00:03:32.345]  We hate Al Gore.
[00:03:32.345 --> 00:03:34.606]  But there was evidence, we covered it.
[00:03:34.606 --> 00:03:38.828]  There was total evidence in 2004 in Ohio and other states.
[00:03:38.828 --> 00:03:41.330]  People went to prison over it.
[00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.870]  We covered it.
[00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:51.652]  Not that it would have mattered if his skull and bones cousin would have gotten into power, of course, Senator Kerry, John Kerry.
[00:03:51.652 --> 00:03:55.253]  But still, we cover the fact that there was fraud and Kerry didn't challenge it.
[00:03:55.253 --> 00:03:56.394]  You can't just fix an election.
[00:03:56.394 --> 00:03:59.795]  You've got to have somebody who won't challenge it if you have stolen it.
[00:03:59.795 --> 00:04:08.178]  Well, now there's clear evidence all over the country in these key Senate races where Democrats were set to lose where they have now won.
[00:04:08.578 --> 00:04:11.922]  Now, Rand Paul had a 15-point lead in most polls going in.
[00:04:11.922 --> 00:04:13.784]  He only won by 10 points.
[00:04:13.784 --> 00:04:19.510]  And there was some evidence of manipulation going on there against him, but it wasn't enough because of landslides.
[00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:25.056]  They're afraid to steal elections in front of tidal waves because they know there'd be investigations.
[00:04:25.056 --> 00:04:27.919]  But when races are close, that's where you see the cheating.
[00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:31.401]  2000 presidential, 2004 presidential.
[00:04:31.401 --> 00:04:35.023]  Now we've seen it in this key midterm election, 2010.
[00:04:35.023 --> 00:04:43.007]  You better believe and bet your boots you're going to see that going on coming up the next year and a half, two years ahead of the key 2012 election.
[00:04:43.007 --> 00:04:45.168]  We're going to cover all the different angles.
[00:04:45.168 --> 00:04:51.752]  The economy, the fear-mongering, the new wave of demonization against Rand Paul.
[00:04:51.752 --> 00:04:54.013]  They say he's going to cause a global depression.
[00:04:54.013 --> 00:04:55.153]  That's what Oberman and others say.
[00:04:55.153 --> 00:04:56.034]  That's the new talking point.
[00:04:56.334 --> 00:04:58.136]  Not the fellow reserve that engineered this.
[00:04:58.136 --> 00:04:59.297]  It's all Rand Paul's fault.
[00:04:59.297 --> 00:05:00.399]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:00.399 --> 00:05:01.019]  Hello, friends.
[00:05:01.019 --> 00:05:02.040]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.424]  You've heard me talk about Calden 5 Star Soaps for years.
[00:05:05.424 --> 00:05:10.650]  This is an American-made product of the highest quality and compares to nothing you will find in stores.
[00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:14.074]  You can buy factory direct, shipped via UPS right to your door.

[00:05:21.722 --> 00:05:24.364]  Once you've used pure soap, you won't buy anything else.
[00:05:24.364 --> 00:05:30.891]  Since 1947, Calvin Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.
[00:05:30.891 --> 00:05:32.392]  Buy American and stay clean.

[00:05:36.096 --> 00:05:37.437]  Well, Marty, what do you have to say?

[00:05:52.614 --> 00:05:52.954]  Thank you!
[00:06:01.235 --> 00:06:05.259]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:08.483]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:06:08.483 --> 00:06:13.308]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:06:13.308 --> 00:06:19.695]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:06:19.695 --> 00:06:21.938]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:06:22.458 --> 00:06:24.079]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:06:24.079 --> 00:06:25.220]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:27.461]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:06:41.351 --> 00:06:45.736]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[00:06:45.736 --> 00:06:48.639]  we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:57.750]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.743]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[00:07:03.743 --> 00:07:05.044]  It ended on June of 2009.
[00:07:05.044 --> 00:07:09.448]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[00:07:09.448 --> 00:07:15.394]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[00:07:15.394 --> 00:07:17.535]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[00:07:17.535 --> 00:07:20.218]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[00:07:20.558 --> 00:07:27.063]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[00:07:27.063 --> 00:07:29.264]  They both make fabulous investments.
[00:07:29.264 --> 00:07:34.608]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[00:07:34.608 --> 00:07:39.892]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[00:07:39.892 --> 00:07:45.056]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long-term.
[00:07:45.256 --> 00:07:48.438]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[00:07:48.438 --> 00:07:51.359]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[00:07:51.359 --> 00:07:52.180]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:54.761]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:07:54.761 --> 00:07:56.282]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:24.439]  I have a message.
[00:08:24.439 --> 00:08:27.120]  A message from the Tea Party.
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:31.221]  A message that is loud and clear and does not mince words.
[00:08:31.221 --> 00:08:42.886]  We've come to take our government back.
[00:08:42.886 --> 00:08:50.429]  We've come to take our government back from the special interest who think that the federal government is their own personal ATM.
[00:08:51.636 --> 00:09:02.479]  From the politicians who bring us oversized fake checks emblazoned with their signature as if it was their money to give.
[00:09:02.479 --> 00:09:05.640]  Washington is horribly broken.
[00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:07.981]  I think we stand on a precipice.
[00:09:07.981 --> 00:09:20.465]  We are encountering a day of reckoning and this movement, this Tea Party movement, is a message to Washington that we're unhappy and that we want things done differently.
[00:09:23.058 --> 00:09:24.540]  All right.
[00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:32.307]  That's what Rand Paul said a few months ago when he defeated the pro-establishment Republican candidate in the primary.
[00:09:32.307 --> 00:09:35.871]  Karl Rove and many others came out against him.
[00:09:35.871 --> 00:09:37.973]  Dick Cheney had come out against him.
[00:09:37.973 --> 00:09:40.376]  They'd thrown everything against him and then they
[00:09:40.896 --> 00:09:47.880]  Shifted to the left side of the controlled system and turned everything loose on him.
[00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:56.485]  Every dirty trick they could and it only made his poll numbers go up because people saw through it.
[00:09:56.485 --> 00:09:58.486]  And last night he said the same thing.
[00:09:58.486 --> 00:10:00.087]  He said, I have a message from Kentucky.
[00:10:02.079 --> 00:10:04.983]  We have come to take our government back.
[00:10:04.983 --> 00:10:11.170]  Now, this is different than 1994 with Newt Gingrich leading that new crop of Republicans.
[00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:13.874]  We weren't in a depression.
[00:10:13.874 --> 00:10:16.036]  We hadn't had the giant banker bailouts.
[00:10:16.036 --> 00:10:20.121]  The dollar wasn't openly being scrapped as the world reserve currency.
[00:10:21.132 --> 00:10:37.239]  And so if the Republicans think they're going to be able to manage all these new Tea Party patriots that have gotten in, if they think that they are going to be able to stay in power and gain seats in the next election by selling people out with business as usual, they're wrong.
[00:10:37.859 --> 00:10:51.316]  Senator DeMint and others have said if they don't see instant action to cut taxes across the board, which will get the economy going, every study shows, every common sense example documents, he's going to leave the Republican Party.
[00:10:52.574 --> 00:10:57.916]  Now there has been clear election fraud in key races like Colorado.
[00:10:57.916 --> 00:11:03.398]  And we had, of course, the nonpartisan, she's a Democrat, but nonpartisan in her investigations.
[00:11:03.398 --> 00:11:08.900]  Bev Harris on yesterday, she said she was looking at Nevada and Colorado as some of the worst places.
[00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:15.062]  The polls showed that Tom Tancredo, running as an independent, Constitution Party, was set to win.
[00:11:15.062 --> 00:11:16.163]  He magically lost.
[00:11:16.983 --> 00:11:21.404]  All the polls show that Harry Reid was going to lose by 3 to 5 points.
[00:11:21.404 --> 00:11:23.885]  He magically won by 5.
[00:11:23.885 --> 00:11:27.946]  You're talking 7 to 10 point swing.
[00:11:27.946 --> 00:11:31.867]  And you've got total evidence of election fraud in Nevada.
[00:11:31.867 --> 00:11:36.309]  We're also looking very closely at Colorado and other states.
[00:11:36.309 --> 00:11:38.089]  Key battleground areas.
[00:11:38.089 --> 00:11:42.771]  But as this awakening accelerates, and as Congress' approval rating stays at 11 points,
[00:11:43.971 --> 00:11:56.275]  You are going to see more independents elected or more people through the Republican Party like Ron Paul and Rand Paul getting elected because now people are aware of real issues.
[00:11:56.275 --> 00:12:01.196]  They're aware of the puppet masters that sit above the two major parties.
[00:12:02.802 --> 00:12:04.183]  It doesn't mean we're out of the woods.
[00:12:04.183 --> 00:12:06.224]  We're in deep trouble as a society.
[00:12:06.224 --> 00:12:11.387]  But it's because we are in deep trouble that a lot of people are being forced to look at the evidence and wake up.
[00:12:11.387 --> 00:12:15.049]  So, here's the issues I want to cover today.
[00:12:15.049 --> 00:12:17.290]  I want to look at election fraud.
[00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:21.713]  I want to look at the message that it sends with Rand Paul winning.
[00:12:21.713 --> 00:12:29.537]  And the caucus that he needs to organize to bring true leadership, constitutional leadership, to the U.S.
[00:12:29.537 --> 00:12:29.818]  Senate.
[00:12:30.609 --> 00:12:40.243]  We also need to push for Ron Paul to be the new speaker, not John Boehner and not Michelle Bachman.
[00:12:40.243 --> 00:12:44.269]  And there may be a fight between those two, Boehner and Bachman.
[00:12:44.269 --> 00:12:45.330]  Boehner better than Bachman.
[00:12:47.884 --> 00:12:55.208]  Somebody like Newt Gingrich, but still not as good as somebody like Bachman, and Bachman is not as good as Ron Paul.
[00:12:55.208 --> 00:13:06.374]  We need to get Ron Paul positioned as the speaker for a leadership position and a powerful bully pulpit in the move for Ron Paul to run for president in 2012.
[00:13:06.374 --> 00:13:08.015]  He can beat Barack Obama.
[00:13:08.015 --> 00:13:15.279]  We wrote a key story yesterday going over the different angles of that, and it's all online at InfoWars.com.
[00:13:17.452 --> 00:13:22.378]  We also are going to look at how they're going to try to demonize the Patriot movement.
[00:13:22.378 --> 00:13:24.800]  This is what happened in 1929.
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:29.005]  The central bankers had been in control since 1913.
[00:13:29.005 --> 00:13:31.508]  They'd issued all this currency and credit.
[00:13:31.508 --> 00:13:33.771]  They popped the balloon by design.
[00:13:33.771 --> 00:13:36.373]  That's mainline history if you actually dig into it.
[00:13:37.159 --> 00:13:39.381]  There were congressional hearings about it.
[00:13:39.381 --> 00:13:56.575]  Smooth Hauling's act was put in to put tariffs in, to cut taxes, to do what was needed, but it was too little too late, so the media blamed Smooth Hauling and that legislation for the collapse of 1929, even though Smooth Hauling came during 1929.
[00:13:59.065 --> 00:14:06.488]  And so we see the new talking point, MSNBC, fearmongers about Rand Paul causing worldwide depression.
[00:14:06.488 --> 00:14:16.471]  That's right, Rand Paul, who's never held political office, who is a eye doctor, it's all his fault.
[00:14:16.471 --> 00:14:22.894]  So see, now they know we're going into a depression, you're gonna see the media shift from denying the depression,
[00:14:24.417 --> 00:14:33.265]  To saying it's the fault of the Tea Party, because the Tea Party is going to reverse the Obama tax increases.
[00:14:33.265 --> 00:14:35.907]  They are going to reverse the healthcare if they can.
[00:14:35.907 --> 00:14:37.969]  They're going to reverse the carbon taxes.
[00:14:37.969 --> 00:14:46.216]  They're in the news saying, oh my gosh, these new Republicans, these new radical extremists, they're gonna cut Obama's clean air initiatives.
[00:14:46.216 --> 00:14:48.157]  Has nothing to do with the air.
[00:14:48.157 --> 00:14:49.939]  Cutting carbon dioxide.
[00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:55.747]  When China, India, and everybody else around the world doesn't have to make the cuts.
[00:14:55.747 --> 00:14:57.109]  Now, it's common sense.
[00:14:57.109 --> 00:15:05.983]  Giant taxes on all factories and cars and energy and fuel is gonna put a wet blanket on our already sputtering economy.
[00:15:07.179 --> 00:15:08.680]  That's common sense.
[00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:19.247]  Every study, and you go back to Kennedy cutting taxes by 50% in one bracket, 30% in another, that doubled tax receipts for the federal government in 1961-62.
[00:15:19.247 --> 00:15:20.628]  Doubled receipts!
[00:15:20.628 --> 00:15:22.589]  That's how you pay off deficits.
[00:15:22.589 --> 00:15:26.032]  You freeze or cut spending.
[00:15:26.032 --> 00:15:28.273]  See, Reagan didn't do that.
[00:15:28.273 --> 00:15:35.178]  Reagan cut taxes so more money came in, but then government ballooned in size and outstripped even
[00:15:37.284 --> 00:15:39.046]  The increases in revenue.
[00:15:39.046 --> 00:15:40.807]  Because he let the Congress do that.
[00:15:40.807 --> 00:15:41.448]  You gotta do both.
[00:15:41.448 --> 00:15:43.369]  You gotta freeze or cut.
[00:15:43.369 --> 00:15:45.331]  But freezing is good enough.
[00:15:45.331 --> 00:15:47.553]  You've gotta freeze spending.
[00:15:47.553 --> 00:15:52.437]  Not give trillions more to the bankers who keep the money for themselves and don't even put it into the economy.
[00:15:52.437 --> 00:15:59.143]  It's bad enough to take it and devalue the currency, but at least there's some value while they're devaluing it if it actually goes to the public.
[00:15:59.143 --> 00:16:02.126]  Because it's the public that ultimately has to pay this back in taxes.
[00:16:06.411 --> 00:16:08.913]  We also have to remember that puppets come and go.
[00:16:08.913 --> 00:16:10.694]  Puppet Bush got blamed for everything.
[00:16:10.694 --> 00:16:12.035]  He was a bad guy, but a puppet.
[00:16:12.035 --> 00:16:15.318]  Nonetheless, reading off teleprompters, he took the blame for everything.
[00:16:15.318 --> 00:16:21.743]  Then the new puppet, Obama, came in, continued the exact same agenda, and now Obama's doing his job.
[00:16:21.743 --> 00:16:25.025]  Obama to take responsibility for voter frustration.
[00:16:25.025 --> 00:16:28.728]  What did I say in my film a year and a half ago, the Obama deception?
[00:16:28.728 --> 00:16:29.729]  Now more than a year and a half ago.
[00:16:31.104 --> 00:16:34.225]  What did I say in Fall of the Republic, came out about a year ago?
[00:16:34.225 --> 00:16:45.547]  I said Obama would be politically destroyed, and that he was designed to be politically destroyed, and I said that when he had a 70% approval rating when he first got in office.
[00:16:45.547 --> 00:16:48.048]  Because he's birdcage liner.
[00:16:48.048 --> 00:16:58.770]  They put the liner in, it gets dirty by the bird, everybody blames the liner, everybody looks at the birdcage liner, instead of the bird sitting up there on the perch, soiling the paper.
[00:17:00.031 --> 00:17:05.293]  Now, it's up to this Tea Party revolution to decide if they're going to be fully co-opted by the RINOs.
[00:17:05.293 --> 00:17:15.898]  And we have those internal memos that came out two weeks ago and got leaked, where the mainline Republicans talked about how they were going to dominate these new Republicans and take control of them.
[00:17:17.327 --> 00:17:31.933]  It's up to us as citizens and constituents to continue the awakening and to continue running for office locally and at the state level and federal level to continue to inject real issues into the debate, just like Ron Paul did in 2007-2008.
[00:17:34.915 --> 00:17:40.437]  So that now he's positioned to run for president at an even higher level and has a real chance of winning.
[00:17:40.437 --> 00:17:42.717]  And now people heard about inflation.
[00:17:42.717 --> 00:17:44.718]  They heard about dollar devaluation.
[00:17:44.718 --> 00:17:46.939]  They heard about CIA drug trafficking.
[00:17:46.939 --> 00:17:49.339]  Because Ron Paul talked about it.
[00:17:49.339 --> 00:17:57.282]  That's now positioned and he's winning most of the major Republican straw polls for president, including the coveted CPAC.
[00:17:59.366 --> 00:18:00.887]  That scares the system.
[00:18:00.887 --> 00:18:03.408]  This is a major political realignment.
[00:18:03.408 --> 00:18:10.753]  Not just, oh, we don't like Bill Clinton going after our guns and raising taxes, so we're gonna, you know, put a bunch of new Republicans in.
[00:18:10.753 --> 00:18:13.555]  That was 15, 16 years ago.
[00:18:13.555 --> 00:18:18.257]  This is 2010, not 1994.
[00:18:18.257 --> 00:18:23.701]  And the system is scared because people are becoming fully awake to what's going on.
[00:18:23.701 --> 00:18:25.122]  And any way you slice it,
[00:18:25.902 --> 00:18:27.163]  This is a big victory.
[00:18:27.163 --> 00:18:35.666]  Because watching national ads, listening to local Texas ads, you name it, and seeing ads in other states, the politicians are, I own guns!
[00:18:35.666 --> 00:18:37.307]  I got a gun in my boot!
[00:18:37.307 --> 00:18:42.149]  You know, Democrats are doing TV ads shooting bullets through the cap-and-trade bill.
[00:18:42.149 --> 00:18:43.850]  They're talking about the New World Order.
[00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:45.910]  They're talking about fighting the globalists.
[00:18:45.910 --> 00:18:47.811]  They're talking about saving the dollar.
[00:18:47.811 --> 00:18:49.932]  They're talking about shutting down the borders.
[00:18:49.932 --> 00:18:51.673]  They're talking about cutting taxes.
[00:18:53.078 --> 00:19:05.821]  So we've at least forced the system to stop trying to suppress the Liberty Movement and saying it didn't exist, and the world government didn't exist, and corrupt bankers didn't exist, and socialism didn't exist.
[00:19:05.821 --> 00:19:08.221]  They can't call us conspiracy theorists anymore.
[00:19:08.221 --> 00:19:11.482]  We are the mainstream.
[00:19:11.482 --> 00:19:16.663]  The more radical you are, the more you win, unless Harry Reid steals the election from you.
[00:19:17.796 --> 00:19:20.438]  Or unless they steal the election from you in Colorado.
[00:19:20.438 --> 00:19:22.159]  Clear evidence of fraud in both states.
[00:19:22.159 --> 00:19:23.220]  We're going to be covering that.
[00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:30.646]  So we're going to talk about where we go from here, the demonization tactics that are going to happen against the Tea Party, and the figurehead, Rand Paul Ron Paul.
[00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:35.472]  Gotta love that father-son combo, both medical doctors.
[00:19:35.472 --> 00:19:37.073]  We're going to look at all the different races.
[00:19:37.073 --> 00:19:39.174]  At least 65 seats are going to get taken.
[00:19:39.174 --> 00:19:40.875]  Confirmed 63 right now.
[00:19:40.875 --> 00:19:44.077]  Projecting 65 in the House.
[00:19:44.077 --> 00:19:44.797]  8 Senate seats.
[00:19:44.797 --> 00:19:45.638]  They don't get the Senate.
[00:19:45.638 --> 00:19:49.400]  10 new Republicans posing as patriots.
[00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:51.321]  At least they've got a pose.
[00:19:51.321 --> 00:19:53.422]  That's mainlining this info.
[00:19:53.422 --> 00:19:56.444]  This is a big, big, big victory.
[00:19:56.444 --> 00:19:57.645]  It's all coming up.
[00:19:57.645 --> 00:19:58.985]  And we've got a special guest joining us.
[00:19:58.985 --> 00:19:59.366]  Stay with us.
[00:20:00.783 --> 00:20:04.966]  In a coming apart world, you need something to keep it tied together.
[00:20:04.966 --> 00:20:06.828]  That something is Atwood Rope.
[00:20:06.828 --> 00:20:08.929]  The highest quality rope made in the USA.
[00:20:08.929 --> 00:20:14.774]  From exotic braids for military, rescue, arborists, shipyards, towline, or boating.
[00:20:14.774 --> 00:20:18.456]  Quality rope at affordable prices you and your customers can depend on.

[00:20:30.445 --> 00:20:31.686]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:20:31.686 --> 00:20:36.249]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:20:36.249 --> 00:20:42.053]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:20:42.053 --> 00:20:45.695]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:20:45.695 --> 00:20:48.417]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.

[00:21:13.176 --> 00:21:15.458]  You have the opportunity to make a change in November by
[00:21:15.578 --> 00:21:16.238]  We're good to go.
[00:21:38.891 --> 00:21:45.053]  I have many different ways to accomplish this, from medals for possession to IRA rollovers, tax free, and everything in between.

[00:21:50.574 --> 00:21:52.615]  If you are ready for a change, please call Duane Daly.
[00:22:00.345 --> 00:22:04.249]  I'm concerned about food for my family in the event of an emergency.
[00:22:04.249 --> 00:22:06.190]  And I know you are too.
[00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:07.251]  Are you ready?
[00:22:07.251 --> 00:22:09.193]  Don't wait for an emergency to happen.
[00:22:09.193 --> 00:22:13.797]  Put a plan together now with quality dehydrated food from Ready Reserve Foods.
[00:22:13.797 --> 00:22:20.343]  For nearly 40 years, Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation canning the finest in dehydrated foods.
[00:22:20.343 --> 00:22:22.385]  Other companies just broker canned foods.

[00:22:58.642 --> 00:22:59.863]  Wholesale Pricing.
[00:22:59.863 --> 00:23:01.084]  Global meltdowns.
[00:23:01.084 --> 00:23:02.284]  Massive unemployment.
[00:23:02.284 --> 00:23:03.245]  Endless wars.
[00:23:03.245 --> 00:23:04.746]  A new currency crisis.
[00:23:04.746 --> 00:23:06.567]  Financially and morally bankrupt.
[00:23:06.707 --> 00:23:09.088]  A great and terrible storm is approaching.
[00:23:09.088 --> 00:23:12.630]  So what's the best way to get ready to get prepared for hard times ahead?
[00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:22.235]  In producing Off The Grid News, a weekly newsletter for independent patriots who want practical advice on how to survive and prosper in an increasingly dangerous world.
[00:23:22.235 --> 00:23:25.256]  It's the best way to get a black belt in emergency preparedness.
[00:23:25.316 --> 00:23:27.777]  Survival skills and off-the-grid living.
[00:23:27.777 --> 00:23:30.258]  Off-the-grid news is fiercely independent.
[00:23:30.258 --> 00:23:41.262]  All about self-reliance and packed with helpful information on survival gardening, food preparation, alternative energy, herbal medicines, privacy and security, as well as God, gold and guns.
[00:23:41.262 --> 00:23:43.222]  With absolutely no apologies.
[00:23:43.222 --> 00:23:47.844]  And the best part, this $100 a year service is now free of charge for our listeners.
[00:23:47.844 --> 00:23:48.304]  That's right.
[00:23:48.404 --> 00:23:49.964]  Okay, I've gone over the basics.
[00:23:49.964 --> 00:23:51.445]  I want to start drilling down.
[00:24:16.684 --> 00:24:17.745]  Into all of this now.
[00:24:17.745 --> 00:24:21.748]  I'm going to just read some headlines that cover the spectrum.
[00:24:21.748 --> 00:24:25.911]  Then I'm going to get into, did Harry Reid steal Nevada?
[00:24:25.911 --> 00:24:28.733]  And I want to make this a Google search term today.
[00:24:28.733 --> 00:24:30.474]  We do this at least once a week.
[00:24:30.474 --> 00:24:32.095]  You guys are awesome out there.
[00:24:32.095 --> 00:24:36.838]  All the great men and women that take action and enter this term into Google over and over again.
[00:24:36.838 --> 00:24:38.680]  Steal Nevada.
[00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:39.921]  Two words.
[00:24:39.921 --> 00:24:41.442]  Steal Nevada.
[00:24:42.142 --> 00:24:51.045]  And then it'll be the number one search term, and people will look at this article by Paul Joseph Watson and myself, and I'm gonna be covering, coming up later in the hour.
[00:24:51.045 --> 00:24:58.708]  But the search term is, Steal Nevada, and that will lead them to, Did Harry Reid Steal Nevada?
[00:24:58.708 --> 00:25:04.110]  In fact, we could do two search terms, Steal Nevada, and then also Read Steal Nevada.
[00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:11.651]  But, steal Nevada, enter that in over and over again, and read, steal Nevada, and when we go over this evidence, it's gonna blow you away.
[00:25:11.651 --> 00:25:15.116]  I know most of you are already aware of what's been happening the last few weeks, but they did it.
[00:25:15.816 --> 00:25:18.137]  I mean, there's no doubt it's a conflict of interest.
[00:25:18.137 --> 00:25:21.138]  There's no doubt this stinks to high heaven.
[00:25:21.138 --> 00:25:22.978]  So we're going to be covering all of that.
[00:25:22.978 --> 00:25:24.919]  Here are just some of the headlines.
[00:25:24.919 --> 00:25:27.059]  Republicans capture House in historic wave.
[00:25:27.059 --> 00:25:29.040]  Democrats cling to Senate.
[00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:32.541]  Fox News and CNN are both projecting 65 seats in the House.
[00:25:32.541 --> 00:25:34.041]  63 have been confirmed.
[00:25:34.041 --> 00:25:36.362]  And 8 seats in the Senate.
[00:25:36.362 --> 00:25:41.443]  Not the 10 needed, because in key Senate races they clearly stole the elections.
[00:25:41.443 --> 00:25:42.724]  Continuing here.
[00:25:43.829 --> 00:25:46.952]  Republicans win majority in governorships.
[00:25:46.952 --> 00:25:48.933]  The Republicans won the House.
[00:25:48.933 --> 00:25:50.034]  The Democrats kept the Senate.
[00:25:50.034 --> 00:25:54.337]  The GOP won the tiebreaker, capturing the majority of the nation's governorships.
[00:25:54.337 --> 00:26:03.084]  Republicans on Tuesday wrested control of at least 10 statehouses from Democrats as they rode an anti-incumbent wave that will give them more than 30 governorships.
[00:26:03.084 --> 00:26:04.586]  They also won a bunch of legislatures.
[00:26:05.106 --> 00:26:14.212]  Democrats controlled 26 of the 50 state houses before Tuesday's election, and Republicans needed 20 of the 37 contest to seize the majority.
[00:26:14.212 --> 00:26:16.813]  They now have 30 governorships.
[00:26:16.813 --> 00:26:20.575]  Continuing with the news on that front.
[00:26:20.575 --> 00:26:23.157]  Nancy Pelosi ousted as House Speaker.
[00:26:23.157 --> 00:26:24.858]  John Boehner waits in the wings.
[00:26:24.858 --> 00:26:26.579]  I'm going to be talking more about that later.
[00:26:26.579 --> 00:26:27.660]  We don't want John Boehner.
[00:26:28.533 --> 00:26:30.094]  Bare minimum, we want Michelle Bachman.
[00:26:30.094 --> 00:26:31.235]  She's better.
[00:26:31.235 --> 00:26:33.296]  And a lot better than her is Ron Paul.
[00:26:33.296 --> 00:26:36.559]  We need to get a movement going now for Ron Paul as Speaker.
[00:26:36.559 --> 00:26:38.520]  Ron Paul as Speaker.
[00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:39.961]  Ron Paul as Speaker.
[00:26:39.961 --> 00:26:41.562]  He wins the straw polls.
[00:26:41.562 --> 00:26:43.964]  He's been there as long as Boehner.
[00:26:43.964 --> 00:26:48.347]  Boehner is an acolyte, a minion of Newt Gingrich on record.
[00:26:48.347 --> 00:26:51.269]  The guy he put into leadership in 94 when they took the House.
[00:26:51.269 --> 00:26:52.810]  We do not want John Boehner.
[00:26:54.123 --> 00:26:56.765]  And again, Bachman may run for leadership post.
[00:26:56.765 --> 00:26:59.907]  That's being reported that she may challenge Boehner.
[00:26:59.907 --> 00:27:02.308]  Few Democrats survive health care vote.
[00:27:02.308 --> 00:27:03.249]  This is from the Hill.
[00:27:03.249 --> 00:27:06.811]  Almost every Democrat who was up in this election who voted.
[00:27:07.868 --> 00:27:08.289]  I think?
[00:27:28.328 --> 00:27:38.491]  to become governor of Colorado last night, even though most pundits believed he would win, and he was ahead in most polls, but he magically lost, with 87% of the votes now counted.
[00:27:38.491 --> 00:27:39.951]  Very, very suspicious.
[00:27:39.951 --> 00:27:47.373]  That's what Bev Harris of blackboxvoting.org was looking at, was Colorado and Nevada as two of the hot spots where she saw evidence of fraud going on.
[00:27:47.373 --> 00:27:51.174]  Continuing, shift in Washington stirs economic jitters abroad.
[00:27:51.174 --> 00:27:54.395]  That is going to integrate in with this new talking point
[00:27:54.855 --> 00:28:02.897]  From MSNBC, CNBC and others, including CNN, Oberman, Maddow and others.
[00:28:02.897 --> 00:28:04.418]  We have that clip coming up later.
[00:28:04.418 --> 00:28:07.779]  They're saying Rand Paul is going to cause a depression.
[00:28:07.779 --> 00:28:08.259]  That's right.
[00:28:08.259 --> 00:28:09.659]  It's all his fault.
[00:28:09.659 --> 00:28:16.081]  Never been in any political office, not dog catcher, not state legislature, not mayor, not city council.
[00:28:17.383 --> 00:28:20.324]  Not Easter Bunny, no office.
[00:28:20.324 --> 00:28:22.465]  It's all his fault, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:28:22.465 --> 00:28:26.867]  See, right as we try to take America back, they're gonna go, oh, I guess it is a depression.
[00:28:26.867 --> 00:28:28.407]  And it's your fault.
[00:28:28.407 --> 00:28:29.488]  It's your fault.
[00:28:29.488 --> 00:28:30.328]  So that's coming up.
[00:28:30.328 --> 00:28:33.429]  Marijuana legalization measure loses in California.
[00:28:33.429 --> 00:28:37.511]  Big victory for the war on drugs and the out-of-control federal government on that front.
[00:28:38.596 --> 00:28:41.538]  Continuing with the reports here.
[00:28:41.538 --> 00:28:47.082]  Republicans ride voter unrest to control of the House.
[00:28:47.082 --> 00:28:50.664]  The biggest Republican sweep in more than 70 years.
[00:28:50.664 --> 00:28:52.946]  That out of the Associated Press.
[00:28:52.946 --> 00:28:54.347]  We've got the Wall Street Journal.
[00:28:54.347 --> 00:28:56.188]  Welcome Senate conservatives.
[00:28:56.188 --> 00:28:58.750]  Remember what voters back home want.
[00:28:58.750 --> 00:29:01.392]  Less government and more freedom.
[00:29:03.932 --> 00:29:13.354]  Continuing, Boehner wants to shelve health care monstrosity, but knowing the type of Republican he is, he'll give you some other big type of government health care program.
[00:29:13.354 --> 00:29:15.135]  No, we want it out of there.
[00:29:15.135 --> 00:29:16.375]  We want it gone.
[00:29:16.375 --> 00:29:17.755]  Okay?
[00:29:17.755 --> 00:29:21.076]  We don't want eugenics, government-controlled health care.
[00:29:21.076 --> 00:29:26.017]  Tea Party calls for fiscal sanity in Washington.
[00:29:26.017 --> 00:29:28.878]  Here's another report by Kurt Nimmo, Infowars.com.
[00:29:28.878 --> 00:29:32.199]  Can establishment candidates tame the Tea Party fire?
[00:29:33.874 --> 00:29:35.395]  That is just some of what's coming up.
[00:29:35.395 --> 00:29:42.642]  We'll look at the election fraud in Colorado, in Nevada, and other key states, the incredibly crystal clear evidence of that.
[00:29:42.642 --> 00:29:49.147]  We'll look at the big Federal Reserve announcement coming up at 1.15 Central today, dealing with dollar devaluation.
[00:29:49.147 --> 00:29:50.829]  Stay with us.
[00:29:50.829 --> 00:29:52.230]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:54.772]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.772 --> 00:29:57.455]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:04.638 --> 00:30:05.900]  Tyranny is here.
[00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:09.783]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:30:09.783 --> 00:30:12.065]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:30:12.065 --> 00:30:17.951]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:30:17.951 --> 00:30:24.197]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:30:24.597 --> 00:30:30.582]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:30:30.582 --> 00:30:34.766]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:30:34.766 --> 00:30:39.050]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:30:39.050 --> 00:30:45.015]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:30:45.015 --> 00:30:48.558]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:30:48.558 --> 00:30:50.539]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:30:50.539 --> 00:30:50.960]  It's here.

[00:31:00.270 --> 00:31:04.473]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[00:31:04.473 --> 00:31:10.878]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calbin Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[00:31:10.878 --> 00:31:18.264]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:31:18.264 --> 00:31:23.148]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[00:31:31.795 --> 00:31:35.519]  Let's talk to the owner of Five Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[00:31:36.061 --> 00:31:42.827]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[00:31:42.827 --> 00:31:46.730]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[00:31:46.730 --> 00:31:53.095]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.
[00:31:53.095 --> 00:31:53.876]  Thank you.
[00:32:00.882 --> 00:32:16.355]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[00:32:16.355 --> 00:32:20.038]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:32:21.041 --> 00:32:33.813]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[00:32:33.813 --> 00:32:41.080]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[00:32:41.761 --> 00:32:52.128]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[00:32:52.128 --> 00:32:56.071]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[00:32:56.071 --> 00:33:01.835]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[00:33:01.835 --> 00:33:07.859]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[00:33:07.859 --> 00:33:10.401]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:16.238 --> 00:33:19.903]  Coming up next week, we're going to get Ron Paul on, probably Rand Paul.
[00:33:19.903 --> 00:33:23.627]  We've got Judge Napolitano coming on to break down the election aftermath.
[00:33:23.627 --> 00:33:29.074]  We're going to be following the Federal Reserve's announcement coming up in about two hours from now.
[00:33:29.074 --> 00:33:35.381]  They've already basically telegraphed that they're going to have quantitative easing, $50 to $100 billion a month of buying our own debt.
[00:33:35.902 --> 00:33:46.928]  The Communist Chinese are the biggest owners and in just a few months this will make the private Federal Reserve the biggest owner of our debt and then they're paid interest on the debt that they set the policy for.
[00:33:46.928 --> 00:33:47.949]  That is just incredible.
[00:33:47.949 --> 00:33:50.550]  We're going to be looking at all the races around the country.
[00:33:50.550 --> 00:33:56.234]  We're going to be looking at what's going to happen if Republicans don't deliver on getting rid of Obamacare.
[00:33:57.134 --> 00:33:58.536]  They don't control the borders.
[00:33:58.536 --> 00:34:03.843]  Remember the Republicans, you know, in the last Congress before Obama took over, they wanted open borders too.
[00:34:03.843 --> 00:34:07.047]  What's going to happen in this country?
[00:34:07.047 --> 00:34:09.811]  We've also got the report at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:34:09.811 --> 00:34:12.094]  Did Harry Reid steal Nevada?
[00:34:12.094 --> 00:34:14.237]  Clearly there was fraud going on.
[00:34:14.657 --> 00:34:33.741]  We're doing the Google search term today of Steel Nevada, so people will then go read our article breaking down the fact that there was a five-point margin of victory, highly suspicious given pre-election polls showing Sharon Engel ahead, combined with reports of vote flipping for Reid, that's mainstream news confirming that, on machines controlled by Reid's son.
[00:34:33.741 --> 00:34:40.542]  He runs the most populous county there, he's the election official, and serviced by the corrupt pro-Reid union.
[00:34:41.082 --> 00:34:49.907]  So this is huge news, and to discuss this with us is Talk Radio Network syndicated talk show host, Eric Mancow Muller.
[00:34:49.907 --> 00:34:51.849]  Good to have you here with us, Mancow.
[00:34:51.849 --> 00:34:59.513]  Hey Alex, look, I've been all over this thing, and I think I might really make you mad.
[00:34:59.513 --> 00:35:00.494]  Okay.
[00:35:00.494 --> 00:35:02.115]  I think I might really irritate you.
[00:35:02.115 --> 00:35:03.516]  Let me explain something.
[00:35:03.516 --> 00:35:07.118]  First of all, it's the Diebold Company, I believe, and the unions behind these
[00:35:08.109 --> 00:35:12.231]  These machines are absolutely in Terry Reid's pocket.
[00:35:12.231 --> 00:35:20.374]  I had a lot of phone callers, people telling me that they would go in and vote for Hengel and they would see Reid pop up.
[00:35:20.374 --> 00:35:21.694]  There was power outage.
[00:35:21.694 --> 00:35:25.376]  There was a lot of shenanigans.
[00:35:25.376 --> 00:35:34.439]  But I also want to say, since I last spoke with you, I talked to some of the heads of the Republican Party there in Nevada, and I wonder what you make of this.
[00:35:34.439 --> 00:35:35.960]  They all told me they didn't vote for her.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:38.161]  And I said, well, why not?
[00:35:38.161 --> 00:35:42.423]  And they said, because Reid has gotten us so much money.
[00:35:42.423 --> 00:35:44.684]  And I said, well, that's against your principles.
[00:35:44.684 --> 00:35:58.531]  And again, this goes back to what you and I always talk about, which is, we always look at the puppets, which are the Republican candidates or the dummy crap candidates, but we don't pay attention to the puppet masters, who's really controlling things.
[00:35:58.531 --> 00:36:00.852]  And what about your core values?
[00:36:00.852 --> 00:36:01.112]  These are
[00:36:04.423 --> 00:36:07.826]  And they didn't vote for Engel, they voted for Reed, because they like that money.
[00:36:07.826 --> 00:36:14.373]  Uh, it's quite disgusting, so maybe, maybe they didn't show up for Engel like we thought.
[00:36:14.373 --> 00:36:17.456]  Here is something that's really suspect.
[00:36:17.456 --> 00:36:27.126]  And I don't know if you know about this story, this is just breaking, but Engel's hometown, uh, Sharon Engel's hometown, her little town, uh, overwhelmingly voted for Reed.
[00:36:35.458 --> 00:36:43.082]  But in every major poll, she was 2 to 5 points ahead, and then he gets a 5 point lead on top of that.
[00:36:43.082 --> 00:36:47.083]  That's a 7 to almost 10 point swing.
[00:36:47.083 --> 00:36:58.549]  And regardless, Eric, regardless looking at this, we know that it's wrong to have his son running the most populous county where most of the votes were cast.
[00:36:58.549 --> 00:37:00.170]  And we know going back weeks ago,
[00:37:01.070 --> 00:37:02.412]  It was in the local papers.
[00:37:02.412 --> 00:37:04.174]  It was on local TV.
[00:37:04.174 --> 00:37:09.620]  Reporters confirmed that thousands of people could not vote for Sharon Angle.
[00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:12.683]  It would not let them vote for her.
[00:37:12.683 --> 00:37:14.986]  It was only Harry Reid.
[00:37:15.987 --> 00:37:22.351]  And so how do you have a union that's openly endorsing him, running the machines, and then magically this happens?
[00:37:22.351 --> 00:37:24.112]  And then I heard the spin last night.
[00:37:24.112 --> 00:37:36.000]  I heard it on NPR this morning that, oh, we talked to this Republican who, you know, who thought she was too extreme and that she couldn't bring in all the money that the Senate Majority Leader could, you know, with all of his tenure.
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.182]  So they're selling it that, well, it's all this pork barrel.
[00:37:39.182 --> 00:37:40.163]  I don't buy it, Mancow.
[00:37:41.067 --> 00:37:43.328]  Well, look, I hear what you're saying.
[00:37:43.328 --> 00:37:49.912]  I personally talked with some of the top Republicans there and they did confirm that they didn't like Sherrod Engel.
[00:37:49.912 --> 00:37:57.257]  I do feel that many Republicans feel that this Tea Party movement is like a pet rattlesnake.
[00:37:57.257 --> 00:38:04.641]  They act publicly like they're okay with it because, you know, the Tea Party is basically Republican ideals that they abandoned with Bushy.
[00:38:08.608 --> 00:38:13.309]  Well, wait a minute, it's admitted that Sean Hannity, Beck, Limbaugh and others had meetings with Bush in the White House.
[00:38:37.927 --> 00:38:41.649]  Well, look, I was invited to the White House and I didn't do it.
[00:38:41.649 --> 00:38:46.471]  I could have had, you know, Al Gore would have co-hosted with me, but he had to have every question up front.
[00:38:46.471 --> 00:38:52.394]  I could have had the first, this doesn't really relate, but I could have had the first interview with OJ after the trial.
[00:38:52.394 --> 00:38:55.315]  But, you know, they wanted everything scripted and I just won't play that game.
[00:38:55.315 --> 00:39:04.779]  The fact is that if I wanted to do the Republican talking points and the same thing with you, Alex, we would be worth a lot more money and our radio shows would be a lot bigger.
[00:39:04.779 --> 00:39:05.920]  I'm not willing to play the game.
[00:39:06.687 --> 00:39:21.120]  And, you know, having been on Fox every day for seven years and done what I've done and met all these people and been into all their offices and know many of them personally, I love when I tell someone the truth and they say, oh no, that's not it.
[00:39:21.590 --> 00:39:22.250]  No, exactly.
[00:39:22.250 --> 00:39:46.842]  I mean, going back for myself 12 years ago, 10 years ago, 8 years ago, I've been in the offices with the big radio execs, and they say, look, you want to be a star or continue this crusade, be a mainline Republican, play ball, and basically you're not going to have editorial control, we're going to have producers that basically tell you what to cover, and I said no to money that was at one time 10, 15 times what I was making at that time.
[00:39:46.842 --> 00:39:50.764]  So you're absolutely right, and the Democrats are under that similar control
[00:39:51.164 --> 00:39:56.805]  With George Soros and Media Matters and all the rest of these people.
[00:39:56.805 --> 00:39:58.786]  But let's shift gears then.
[00:39:58.786 --> 00:40:00.926]  Wait a minute, Alex.
[00:40:00.926 --> 00:40:02.726]  Alex.
[00:40:02.726 --> 00:40:03.527]  Yes.
[00:40:03.527 --> 00:40:07.807]  I'm talking about radio companies that own well over a thousand radio stations.
[00:40:07.807 --> 00:40:12.088]  They've said to me, look, man cow.
[00:40:12.088 --> 00:40:14.009]  The American people are stupid.
[00:40:14.009 --> 00:40:17.450]  They understand Democrat and they understand Republican.
[00:40:17.450 --> 00:40:19.370]  You have to pick a side and just stick with it.
[00:40:20.305 --> 00:40:22.566]  And, you know, look, I'm a little bit liberal in some ways.
[00:40:22.566 --> 00:40:23.527]  I'm a little bit conservative.
[00:40:23.527 --> 00:40:24.647]  I'm a little bit libertarian.
[00:40:24.647 --> 00:40:27.369]  Most Americans are all over the place.
[00:40:27.369 --> 00:40:37.775]  And what people need to know is this really is... I mean, as a child, I was backstage and saw Hulk Hogan, you know, hanging out with the Iron Sheik.
[00:40:37.775 --> 00:40:40.796]  You go backstage, you see the Globetrotters with the Generals.
[00:40:40.796 --> 00:40:42.137]  It's a put-on.
[00:40:42.137 --> 00:40:44.418]  And here's the point I was getting to, Alex.
[00:40:44.418 --> 00:40:46.079]  I must make this point.
[00:40:46.079 --> 00:40:47.740]  And then we'll talk again.
[00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:49.441]  But folks need to know
[00:40:50.453 --> 00:40:55.376]  Rand Paul, Rubio, and some of these people don't get discouraged because this Tea Party
[00:41:18.232 --> 00:41:22.975]  They cannot let these people, they cannot let this Tea Party movement get ahead.
[00:41:22.975 --> 00:41:24.156]  That's why they were so vicious.
[00:41:24.156 --> 00:41:25.497]  And she was kooky.
[00:41:25.497 --> 00:41:29.619]  She was k-k-kooky, this Christine O'Donnell out of Delaware.
[00:41:29.619 --> 00:41:31.340]  But they have to destroy it.
[00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:32.541]  They have to label it racist.
[00:41:32.541 --> 00:41:34.522]  They have to do whatever they can.
[00:41:34.522 --> 00:41:37.064]  Both sides are freaked out by the Tea Party movement.
[00:41:37.064 --> 00:41:38.185]  And that's the point I wanted to make.
[00:41:38.185 --> 00:41:38.705]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:41:39.013 --> 00:41:41.575]  No, and that's exactly where I was going.
[00:41:41.575 --> 00:41:58.206]  The Real Tea Party, started by Ron Paul 2007, is constitutional, knows how to fix this country, get us back to the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, get out of this police state, and Ron Paul and all the polls is popular with Democrats, Libertarians, and Republicans.
[00:41:58.206 --> 00:42:05.452]  He's winning all the big CPAC polls, and we need to have a movement for Ron Paul to be Speaker of the House, not John Boehner.
[00:42:06.452 --> 00:42:12.399]  Better than Boehner, you know, would be Michelle Bachmann, but the best choice is Ron Paul.
[00:42:12.399 --> 00:42:20.448]  And the system is scared, and that's why two weeks ago, internal memos from the Republican Party got leaked, where they talked about, we've got to oppose this Tea Party.
[00:42:21.169 --> 00:42:26.975]  We've got to talk about being against the world government to get into power and to control this movement.
[00:42:26.975 --> 00:42:36.705]  So you've got the establishment Republicans and establishment Democrats attacking the Tea Party, the Republicans from within by co-opting, and the Democrats from without.
[00:42:36.705 --> 00:42:39.948]  And you absolutely hit the nail on the head, ManCow, mancow.com.
[00:42:41.790 --> 00:43:02.119]  Whenever we go over this information, because the new talking point out of MSNBC and out of CNBC is that the Tea Party candidates are going to cause a depression, and that was the talking point on MSNBC with Manow, Oberman, and Slimeball, Matthews, they all said
[00:43:03.396 --> 00:43:05.937]  He's not going to let us print more money.
[00:43:05.937 --> 00:43:07.698]  He's going to cause a depression.
[00:43:07.698 --> 00:43:10.900]  So we now see them denying we've been in a depression.
[00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:17.324]  Now they're going to blame it on the new Congress as they admit we're in a depression and claim that the Tea Party did it.
[00:43:17.324 --> 00:43:20.806]  We've got to get out ahead of this new talking point and set up.
[00:43:20.806 --> 00:43:22.106]  Mancow, your comment.
[00:43:22.106 --> 00:43:22.987]  Oh, buddy.
[00:43:22.987 --> 00:43:29.510]  Look, first of all, everybody talks about Palin and all of these different women as a flaming heterosexual.
[00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:30.411]  May I just say I
[00:43:31.192 --> 00:43:31.433]  I don't
[00:43:52.452 --> 00:43:54.673]  Uh, no, I know exactly what you're saying.
[00:43:54.673 --> 00:43:56.694]  Listen, the treatment of, you know, let's think about this.
[00:43:56.694 --> 00:43:59.556]  Meg Whitman, she spent, what, $145 million of her own money?
[00:43:59.556 --> 00:44:01.617]  She was called a whore by Jerry Brown?
[00:44:01.617 --> 00:44:02.357]  Governor Moonbeam?
[00:44:02.357 --> 00:44:04.198]  Uh, Fiorini?
[00:44:04.198 --> 00:44:04.759]  Uh, Linda McMahon?
[00:44:20.999 --> 00:44:24.820]  All of these women, uh, Christine O'Donnell, they were called the B-word.
[00:44:24.820 --> 00:44:27.161]  Engel, they called the B-word repeatedly on The View.
[00:44:27.161 --> 00:44:30.962]  Uh, you know, the Tea Party called teabaggers.
[00:44:30.962 --> 00:44:41.746]  And the treatment of Michelle Bachman on MSNBC last night, folks, it... I would say you wouldn't treat a dog like that, but let's say it this way.
[00:44:41.746 --> 00:44:45.887]  Uh, the people in the Middle East who don't like dogs don't treat dogs that bad.
[00:44:47.134 --> 00:44:50.976]  You know that family in the trailer park, they beat their dog and they beat their kids?
[00:44:50.976 --> 00:44:56.919]  I mean, that's how Michelle Bachman, I don't know what a red-headed stepson is, but I'll use that, I guess.
[00:44:56.919 --> 00:45:05.383]  I'm looking for a good analogy, Alex, but Michelle Bachman was just treated so rudely by that man, Rachel Maddow, and Chris Hemsworth.
[00:45:10.286 --> 00:45:13.968]  Well, you can tell who's good.
[00:45:13.968 --> 00:45:19.793]  Anybody they go after is good, and anybody that the establishment Republicans go after we know is good.
[00:45:19.793 --> 00:45:23.696]  In fact, continuing along that line, here's CNBC.
[00:45:23.696 --> 00:45:27.239]  Shift in Washington stirs economic jitters abroad.
[00:45:27.239 --> 00:45:32.503]  They're worried overseas that the devaluation of the dollar won't continue.
[00:45:33.724 --> 00:45:34.524]  Here's another one.
[00:45:34.524 --> 00:45:39.086]  MSNBC fearmonger about Rand Paul causing worldwide depression.
[00:45:39.086 --> 00:45:41.607]  That clip is coming up.
[00:45:41.607 --> 00:45:42.947]  I mean, how crazy is this?
[00:45:42.947 --> 00:45:48.709]  Is that Bill Clinton gets rid of Glass-Steagall, allows the tens of trillions of derivatives counterfeit to be made.
[00:45:48.709 --> 00:45:50.990]  The banks get rich and powerful off of it.
[00:45:50.990 --> 00:45:53.551]  Bush continues that with Henry Paulson.
[00:45:53.551 --> 00:45:55.311]  They hand it off to Obama.
[00:45:55.311 --> 00:45:57.472]  They claim that the Democrats weren't involved in 08.
[00:45:58.092 --> 00:45:58.432]  Go Alex, go!
[00:45:58.432 --> 00:45:58.932]  It was, it was, it was
[00:46:26.267 --> 00:46:31.729]  You know, for your listeners, your millions of listeners that didn't hear it, or see it, it did it!
[00:46:31.729 --> 00:46:47.035]  In the lamestream media last night, Rand Paul, who got up and again, it was Ayn Rand, it was Jefferson, it was Reagan, it was the Bible, it was God, guns and cuts, all the things that I love, and immediately, I mean, and you can see it, they don't even try to hide it anymore, they're so hateful.
[00:46:47.035 --> 00:46:51.537]  And they said Rand Paul will not put, Rand Paul is going to want to put a limit.
[00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:53.522]  On how much we spend.
[00:46:53.522 --> 00:46:56.146]  He's going to want to limit our debt.
[00:46:56.146 --> 00:46:58.751]  Oh my God, Rand Paul wants to limit the debt.
[00:46:58.751 --> 00:47:00.394]  And you know, he may just do it.
[00:47:00.394 --> 00:47:02.638]  He may just stand up and limit the debt.
[00:47:02.638 --> 00:47:04.361]  He may tell our whole government.
[00:47:04.361 --> 00:47:05.443]  He may filibuster.
[00:47:08.976 --> 00:47:14.980]  What, you mean a billion dollars to rebuild Gaza so they have a level spot to launch rockets into innocent Jewish neighborhoods?
[00:47:14.980 --> 00:47:18.543]  Where, what, uh, two hundred thousand, what is it, two hundred million dollars a day?
[00:47:18.543 --> 00:47:23.806]  I've heard ridiculous numbers for, for Oblomov's trip to all the Muslim sites in India.
[00:47:23.806 --> 00:47:27.589]  Uh, the money that we spend on their nonsense!
[00:47:27.589 --> 00:47:30.871]  You mean Rand Paul may say no?
[00:47:30.871 --> 00:47:32.092]  Wow!
[00:47:32.092 --> 00:47:33.913]  And they're all freaking out over it, man.
[00:47:33.913 --> 00:47:35.034]  It was a beautiful thing.
[00:47:37.355 --> 00:47:43.258]  Now, pulling back from this, what other dirty tricks are you expecting to see?
[00:47:43.258 --> 00:47:53.243]  Because Senator DeMint is in the Wall Street Journal today saying he may leave the Republican Party if they continue their activities and if they don't join with the real Tea Party.
[00:47:53.243 --> 00:47:58.745]  And he's also quoted as saying the establishment will try to buy off Tea Party candidates.
[00:47:58.745 --> 00:48:06.469]  Senator DeMint is really trying to position himself as somebody who's going to probably run for president.
[00:48:09.052 --> 00:48:12.715]  Look, Mr. DeMint, Jim DeMint is awesome.
[00:48:12.715 --> 00:48:14.256]  Bachman is awesome.
[00:48:14.256 --> 00:48:20.260]  Rand Paul, these are some great patriotic Americans, no doubt.
[00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:29.386]  You know, look, when you see Dick Armey, Dick Armey, that establishment Republican, he wanted to be the voice of the Tea Party.
[00:48:29.386 --> 00:48:30.027]  Sarah Palin,
[00:48:31.092 --> 00:48:33.193]  He wants to be the voice of the Tea Party.
[00:48:33.193 --> 00:48:34.894]  Here's what I really like.
[00:48:34.894 --> 00:48:37.455]  And again, I'll go out and stand with every dork.
[00:48:37.455 --> 00:48:39.997]  The rest is Thomas Jefferson or Paul Revere.
[00:48:39.997 --> 00:48:44.279]  I stand out there as you do, Alex, and I'll take my pictures with everybody in costume.
[00:48:44.279 --> 00:48:47.280]  And some of them are quite silly looking.
[00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:49.041]  But, you know, look, their hearts are in the right place.
[00:48:49.041 --> 00:48:51.482]  Let me tell you what I love about this Tea Party movement.
[00:48:51.482 --> 00:48:52.623]  It is a movement.
[00:48:52.623 --> 00:48:56.505]  It is we, the people, as our founding fathers intended.
[00:48:56.505 --> 00:48:58.226]  So, Jim DeMint,
[00:48:59.054 --> 00:48:59.975]  You know, I'd want to talk.
[00:48:59.975 --> 00:49:00.976]  I'd speak with him frequently.
[00:49:00.976 --> 00:49:02.137]  I'd love to speak with him about that.
[00:49:02.137 --> 00:49:05.199]  I don't know what his plans are, but I got news for you.
[00:49:05.199 --> 00:49:05.980]  He's not the head.
[00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:07.421]  Rand Paul's not the head.
[00:49:07.421 --> 00:49:09.062]  Ron Paul's not the head.
[00:49:09.062 --> 00:49:14.186]  We are the head of the Tea Party movement, and that's what frightens the establishment.
[00:49:14.597 --> 00:49:19.419]  All right, now let's be specific in the time we've got left, and I agree with you on what you just said.
[00:49:19.419 --> 00:49:24.082]  I'm here in Texas, and so we've got our ear to the ground, but Rick Perry's got his new book out.
[00:49:24.082 --> 00:49:25.502]  He's going on his tour.
[00:49:25.502 --> 00:49:30.665]  The inside scoop is Rick Perry for president, Sarah Palin for vice president.
[00:49:30.665 --> 00:49:31.765]  They're both photogenic.
[00:49:33.226 --> 00:49:46.590]  Perry talks all this Patriot talk, but he pushed Gardasil for girls, NAFTA and GATT, North American Union highways, and that's a really scary ticket with Rick Perry and Sarah Palin.
[00:49:46.590 --> 00:49:48.070]  Give us your view on that.
[00:49:48.070 --> 00:49:52.431]  Well, look, I was listening to McCain last night.
[00:49:52.431 --> 00:49:54.952]  I'm sorry that he was captured.
[00:49:54.952 --> 00:49:58.873]  You can't say anything about him because he was captured in Vietnam, but I'm sorry.
[00:49:58.873 --> 00:50:00.393]  I'm going to break the rules.
[00:50:00.393 --> 00:50:02.174]  McCain says one thing and does another.
[00:50:03.281 --> 00:50:04.802]  I call that a liar.
[00:50:04.802 --> 00:50:08.765]  Perry, there in Texas, and of course, you know, I love Texas.
[00:50:08.765 --> 00:50:09.585]  I love it.
[00:50:09.585 --> 00:50:10.226]  I want to move there.
[00:50:10.226 --> 00:50:14.849]  I'm in this city right now, and wherever there's liberalism, it's awful.
[00:50:14.849 --> 00:50:16.530]  It is a cancer.
[00:50:16.530 --> 00:50:21.613]  Look, I think Perry is a good man, but boy, he has lied a lot to you people, hasn't he?
[00:50:21.613 --> 00:50:23.334]  Palin, I wish he wouldn't have quit.
[00:50:23.334 --> 00:50:24.795]  I don't like quitters.
[00:50:24.795 --> 00:50:26.816]  I think she's said a lot of good stuff.
[00:50:26.816 --> 00:50:32.020]  Let me tell you, I really think Rand Paul, the big story, but also, man oh man, Alex.
[00:50:33.064 --> 00:50:49.313]  I don't know if you know this or not, but their worst nightmare, their worst nightmare, Pelosi, Reid, oh, blah, blah, his wife, Chewbacca, Biden, all the rest of these creeps, Bonnie Flank, their worst nightmare happened yesterday.
[00:50:49.313 --> 00:50:49.913]  Do you know what it was?
[00:50:49.913 --> 00:50:50.713]  You haven't mentioned it.
[00:50:50.713 --> 00:50:51.134]  Stay there.
[00:50:51.134 --> 00:50:55.316]  We're going to do five more minutes with Eric Mancow Muller on the other side, mancow.com.
[00:50:55.316 --> 00:50:58.418]  I'm Alex Jones, infowars.com, prisonplanet.tv.
[00:50:58.418 --> 00:50:58.818]  Stay with us.

[00:52:00.682 --> 00:52:05.645]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:52:05.645 --> 00:52:06.646]  What have we got?
[00:52:06.646 --> 00:52:09.068]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:52:09.068 --> 00:52:10.088]  A republic.
[00:52:10.088 --> 00:52:12.510]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:52:12.510 --> 00:52:15.011]  It's not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:52:15.011 --> 00:52:17.033]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:52:17.033 --> 00:52:18.714]  So they think they own our land?
[00:52:18.714 --> 00:52:20.035]  They think they own our water?
[00:52:20.035 --> 00:52:20.635]  Children?
[00:52:20.635 --> 00:52:21.756]  Our education?
[00:52:21.756 --> 00:52:22.596]  Our money?
[00:52:22.596 --> 00:52:26.259]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:52:26.599 --> 00:52:31.583]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:52:31.583 --> 00:52:32.604]  We have the facts.
[00:52:32.604 --> 00:52:33.765]  We have the Constitution.
[00:52:33.765 --> 00:52:34.665]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:52:34.665 --> 00:52:35.546]  We have common law.
[00:52:35.546 --> 00:52:38.068]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:52:38.068 --> 00:52:41.851]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[00:52:41.971 --> 00:52:46.912]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[00:52:46.912 --> 00:52:48.412]  A new tool in the InfoWars.
[00:52:48.412 --> 00:52:49.493]  Don't tread on me.

[00:53:04.256 --> 00:53:08.057]  My name is Span and I'm 68 years old and I live in Vermont.
[00:53:08.484 --> 00:53:13.208]  In the spring of 2003, I started to have problems with my heart.
[00:53:13.208 --> 00:53:15.290]  It felt like my heart was pounding.
[00:53:15.290 --> 00:53:17.012]  Made me feel breathless.
[00:53:17.012 --> 00:53:21.456]  I tried many, many different things to try to get some help for myself.
[00:53:21.456 --> 00:53:22.537]  Nothing did anything.
[00:53:22.537 --> 00:53:26.521]  Heart and Body Extract is very powerful, very effective, and works quickly.
[00:53:26.521 --> 00:53:30.644]  I saw one of Sharon's ads and ordered Heart and Body Extract.
[00:53:30.644 --> 00:53:33.287]  I noticed a difference quickly, within days.
[00:53:33.727 --> 00:53:38.751]  The episodes became less frequent and by a month had completely vanished.

[00:54:06.947 --> 00:54:13.470]  You know, the neocons wrote articles saying Alex Jones will have a connection to the U.S.
[00:54:13.470 --> 00:54:15.091]  Senate if Rand Paul gets in.
[00:54:15.091 --> 00:54:20.674]  They actually ran TV ads demonizing Rand Paul for being a supporter of this show.
[00:54:20.674 --> 00:54:25.877]  So, during the campaign, I didn't even try to get Rand on, but we called him this morning, just talked to him.
[00:54:25.877 --> 00:54:27.878]  He's taking a few days off with the family.
[00:54:27.878 --> 00:54:29.799]  Extended interview next week.
[00:54:29.799 --> 00:54:33.200]  We are very excited about that.
[00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:34.241]  And can you imagine
[00:54:34.821 --> 00:54:38.263]  Ron Paul running for president, winning the CPAC straw poll.
[00:54:38.263 --> 00:54:39.463]  He can win.
[00:54:39.463 --> 00:54:41.964]  Can you imagine Rand Paul?
[00:54:41.964 --> 00:54:52.309]  I mean, and this shows that, and I want you, Mancow, to get to the key point that makes the blah blah and the globalists so scared, but the point I want to make just briefly is
[00:54:53.129 --> 00:54:56.211]  Well, look, I would go to battle for Rand.
[00:54:56.211 --> 00:54:58.113]  I would go to battle for Ron Paul.
[00:55:22.176 --> 00:55:49.420]  I want to, before I get to the point here, you know, let me just say one thing about Grant Paul and the Paul family, and that is, I saw on the networks over and over, they would take a poll of people and run, and I wonder if you remember this, Alex, they would have Giuliani, it was amongst Republicans, and they would have the debates at the Ronald Reagan Library or whatever it was, and they would, you know, the networks were pushing
[00:55:52.961 --> 00:55:53.461]  I don't know.
[00:56:05.660 --> 00:56:12.343]  Every single poll, Ron Paul would win, and then they would laugh and say, oh yeah, but okay, now let's talk about Giuliani some more.
[00:56:12.343 --> 00:56:13.523]  Yeah, even Fox News!
[00:56:13.523 --> 00:56:17.404]  Even Fox News kept saying, we don't know why Ron Paul keeps winning!
[00:56:17.404 --> 00:56:24.227]  And then he goes to the CPAC convention, and all the mainline Republicans, standing ovations, and he wins!
[00:56:24.227 --> 00:56:24.947]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:56:24.947 --> 00:56:26.668]  Ha ha ha ha, Ron Paul!
[00:56:26.668 --> 00:56:28.729]  Now let's give you the guy we push.
[00:56:28.729 --> 00:56:32.490]  If they really count the votes, Rand Paul or Ron Paul could win.
[00:56:35.336 --> 00:56:37.638]  Well, today I'm playing Marco Rubio.
[00:56:37.638 --> 00:56:46.023]  Here is a Latino, a right-wing, freedom-loving Latino.
[00:56:46.023 --> 00:56:46.704]  He's a U.S.
[00:56:46.704 --> 00:56:47.284]  Senator.
[00:56:47.284 --> 00:56:48.685]  Do you understand?
[00:56:48.685 --> 00:56:50.406]  Look, they have to destroy this guy.
[00:56:50.406 --> 00:56:52.368]  They could not have a strong woman like Taylor.
[00:57:15.692 --> 00:57:21.914]  So that's the big fear they've got, is that all these women and minorities are getting elected as patriots.
[00:57:21.914 --> 00:57:26.455]  That screws up their little bandwagon of claiming anybody who isn't a communist is a racist.
[00:57:42.893 --> 00:57:44.073]  Alex, I'm telling you, watch him.
[00:57:44.073 --> 00:57:44.774]  I hope he's the real deal.
[00:58:08.288 --> 00:58:18.959]  Well, we're going to find out in the next year if the neocons and the mainline Republicans can derail the Tea Party or if they all have to be thrown out coming up in the next election.
[00:58:18.959 --> 00:58:21.161]  But either way, the momentum has shifted.
[00:58:21.161 --> 00:58:23.003]  The people are awakened.
[00:58:23.003 --> 00:58:26.747]  Anti-globalism, anti-New World Order is trans-partisan.
[00:58:26.747 --> 00:58:27.768]  We're going to win.
[00:58:27.768 --> 00:58:29.430]  Man Cow, thanks for spending time with us.
[00:58:32.341 --> 00:58:33.322]  Alright, there goes Mancala.
[00:58:33.322 --> 00:58:35.983]  I join him every Wednesday on his syndicated broadcast.
[00:58:35.983 --> 00:58:42.127]  We'll be right back with a second hour with election fraud news and your phone calls.
[00:58:42.127 --> 00:58:43.527]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:58:43.527 --> 00:58:46.769]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:50.503 --> 00:58:55.067]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:58:55.067 --> 00:58:55.967]  Number 1.
[00:58:55.967 --> 00:58:59.410]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:58:59.410 --> 00:59:00.271]  Number 2.
[00:59:00.271 --> 00:59:05.154]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:59:05.154 --> 00:59:05.895]  It's true.
[00:59:05.895 --> 00:59:10.779]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:59:10.779 --> 00:59:11.599]  Number 3.
[00:59:11.599 --> 00:59:15.182]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:59:15.182 --> 00:59:18.865]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:59:19.085 --> 00:59:19.886]  Number 4.
[00:59:19.886 --> 00:59:22.648]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:59:22.648 --> 00:59:26.331]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:59:26.331 --> 00:59:27.112]  Number 5.
[00:59:27.112 --> 00:59:31.256]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:59:31.256 --> 00:59:36.020]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:59:36.300 --> 00:59:40.484]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:59:40.484 --> 00:59:42.266]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:59:42.266 --> 00:59:44.529]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:59:44.529 --> 00:59:47.131]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:59:47.131 --> 00:59:48.533]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:48.533 --> 00:59:54.439]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.509 --> 01:00:10.333]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.333 --> 01:00:11.914]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.914 --> 01:00:13.455]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.455 --> 01:00:17.658]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.658 --> 01:00:21.981]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.981 --> 01:00:24.363]  Alright, here's the deal.
[01:00:24.363 --> 01:00:33.490]  I'm working on getting Dr. Paul Craig Roberts or Bob Chapman to pop in for like ten minutes towards the end of the third hour to be able to comment on
[01:00:35.649 --> 01:00:45.437]  The Federal Reserve's big announcement that is set to be made at 1.15 Central or an hour and 15 minutes from now.
[01:00:45.437 --> 01:00:47.379]  We'll probably even try to carry some of that live.
[01:00:47.379 --> 01:00:51.602]  But they're going to have a closed-door meeting and then some type of press conference.
[01:00:51.602 --> 01:00:57.507]  But they've already telegraphed that they're going to start quantitative easing or further accelerated devaluation of the dollar.
[01:00:59.406 --> 01:01:02.887]  You notice my voice has been really deep on Sunday.
[01:01:02.887 --> 01:01:06.088]  I had a sore throat with allergies.
[01:01:06.088 --> 01:01:09.349]  And then I have a really bad sore throat right now.
[01:01:09.349 --> 01:01:11.650]  If it wasn't the day after election, I wouldn't even be here right now.
[01:01:11.650 --> 01:01:12.290]  I'd be in bed.
[01:01:12.290 --> 01:01:13.651]  I'm not complaining.
[01:01:13.651 --> 01:01:18.273]  I just want you to know why my voice is going all over the place here.
[01:01:18.273 --> 01:01:19.373]  My wife can't even talk.
[01:01:19.373 --> 01:01:20.933]  This thing is going around all over the country.
[01:01:20.933 --> 01:01:23.494]  It was some type of laryngitis.
[01:01:23.494 --> 01:01:26.015]  In fact, I forgot to ask you guys, can I have some more water?
[01:01:26.015 --> 01:01:27.736]  I forgot to get it during the break.
[01:01:27.736 --> 01:01:28.296]  Hold on just a minute.
[01:01:33.963 --> 01:01:35.765]  Okay.
[01:01:35.765 --> 01:01:46.176]  Now, I want to open the phones up, but I want to also go over the key election fraud in Colorado and Nevada.
[01:01:46.176 --> 01:01:50.040]  I want to look at the demonization tactics they're going to use against Rand Paul.
[01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:51.963]  I want to try to play some of his speech.
[01:01:53.510 --> 01:01:53.770]  I think?
[01:02:11.357 --> 01:02:12.879]  We're winning ground.
[01:02:12.879 --> 01:02:30.855]  Do you agree with me that at least these patriotic issues of getting rid of the globalist healthcare, the open borders, the big deficits, auditing the Federal Reserve that Rand Paul's a staunch advocate of, I mean, is this not positive that people running on hardcore patriot issues
[01:02:31.596 --> 01:02:46.039]  Caused a huge election sweep, and that Republicans in the last six months tried to beat real Tea Party candidates everywhere, couldn't do it, and so they began to pose mainline Republicans as patriots.
[01:02:46.039 --> 01:02:51.120]  The issue is, though, once they don't deliver, we'll find out who's real and who isn't.
[01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:55.962]  But do you think that I'm being too positive?
[01:02:55.962 --> 01:02:57.482]  Do you think I'm being too positive here?
[01:02:59.881 --> 01:03:14.667]  And should we just go along with the establishment in Nevada, one of the most corrupt states out there in elections going back in history, with all the mafia money and the prostitute rings and the casinos?
[01:03:15.803 --> 01:03:19.126]  They want their big, high-powered guy there.
[01:03:19.126 --> 01:03:21.228]  Should we just shut up about Harry Reid?
[01:03:21.228 --> 01:03:25.951]  It doesn't matter if people couldn't vote for Sharon Engel by the thousands reporting it in mainstream news.
[01:03:25.951 --> 01:03:32.757]  It doesn't matter if his son was running the elections in the county that has more than 50% of the voters in it, the county that Las Vegas is in.
[01:03:32.757 --> 01:03:38.502]  It doesn't matter if the corrupt union who's on record supporting him was in control of the voting machines.
[01:03:40.034 --> 01:03:45.758]  Let's just ignore all of that, and let's just let Harry Reid win.
[01:03:45.758 --> 01:03:48.480]  Where is Sharon Engel calling for an investigation?
[01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:54.604]  Just a week and a half ago, her head lawyer said Harry Reid's gonna steal this election, he's using illegal aliens, and vote flipping.
[01:03:54.604 --> 01:03:55.525]  And we had the evidence.
[01:03:56.912 --> 01:04:00.013]  So, the question is, where do you see this Tea Party movement going?
[01:04:00.013 --> 01:04:03.894]  The media tried to isolate it, tried to claim it's the only movement for liberty.
[01:04:03.894 --> 01:04:06.314]  Democrats are mad as well.
[01:04:06.314 --> 01:04:10.736]  How do we come together as Americans and say, let's stop fighting over Republicans and Democrats.
[01:04:10.736 --> 01:04:17.337]  Let's vote for people that will cut taxes, restore the Bill of Rights and Constitution, remove the naked body scanners.
[01:04:17.337 --> 01:04:20.118]  Rand Paul said he wants to cut defense budget massively.
[01:04:21.564 --> 01:04:24.847]  People are like, wow, Rand Paul says he's for strong defense.
[01:04:24.847 --> 01:04:26.228]  You know, he's a neocon.
[01:04:26.228 --> 01:04:27.349]  That's politics, folks.
[01:04:27.349 --> 01:04:32.393]  He says, yes, I'm for strong defense, but let's cut a lot of the defense budget.
[01:04:32.393 --> 01:04:34.114]  You ever hear Republicans talking like that?
[01:04:34.114 --> 01:04:34.595]  No, you don't.
[01:04:38.618 --> 01:04:40.540]  And he wants to get rid of the Federal Reserve.
[01:04:40.540 --> 01:04:46.044]  That's why he was attacked by Republicans and Democrats in the power structure.
[01:04:46.044 --> 01:04:47.325]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:04:47.325 --> 01:04:49.407]  The economy.
[01:04:49.407 --> 01:04:50.488]  The election.
[01:04:50.488 --> 01:04:51.989]  Where this is going.
[01:04:51.989 --> 01:04:53.950]  Election fraud.
[01:04:53.950 --> 01:04:56.032]  Military news.
[01:04:56.032 --> 01:04:57.313]  Police state news.
[01:04:57.313 --> 01:04:58.414]  WikiLeaks news.
[01:04:58.414 --> 01:04:59.315]  It's all coming up.
[01:05:01.013 --> 01:05:04.597]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[01:05:04.597 --> 01:05:05.898]  It ended on June of 2009.
[01:05:05.898 --> 01:05:10.303]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[01:05:10.303 --> 01:05:16.229]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[01:05:16.229 --> 01:05:18.391]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[01:05:18.391 --> 01:05:21.074]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[01:05:21.414 --> 01:05:27.919]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[01:05:27.919 --> 01:05:30.120]  They both make fabulous investments.
[01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:35.464]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[01:05:35.464 --> 01:05:40.748]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[01:05:40.748 --> 01:05:45.912]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long term.
[01:05:46.112 --> 01:05:49.294]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[01:05:49.294 --> 01:05:54.557]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[01:05:54.557 --> 01:06:00.781]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[01:06:00.781 --> 01:06:07.445]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:06:07.445 --> 01:06:12.588]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:06:12.588 --> 01:06:14.449]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[01:06:16.636 --> 01:06:27.514]  Well they make blue diamond gusset jeans They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you'll love the way they fit

[01:07:56.592 --> 01:08:01.777]  Check them out today.
[01:08:01.777 --> 01:08:04.018]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:04.018 --> 01:08:07.481]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:07.481 --> 01:08:14.167]  I have a message!
[01:08:18.234 --> 01:08:21.478]  A message from the people of Kentucky.
[01:08:21.478 --> 01:08:29.328]  A message that is loud and clear and does not mince words.
[01:08:29.328 --> 01:08:32.072]  We've come to take our government back!
[01:08:46.272 --> 01:08:48.635]  They say that the U.S.
[01:08:48.635 --> 01:08:52.601]  Senate is the world's most deliberative body.
[01:08:52.601 --> 01:08:57.628]  Well, I'm going to ask them to deliberate upon this.
[01:08:57.628 --> 01:09:02.434]  The American people are unhappy with what's going on in Washington.
[01:09:06.937 --> 01:09:12.038]  Eleven percent of the people approve of what's going on in Congress.
[01:09:12.038 --> 01:09:23.001]  But tonight, there's a Tea Party tidal wave, and we're sending a message to them.
[01:09:23.001 --> 01:09:30.824]  We've got all of his different news appearances and his full speech posted at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:09:30.824 --> 01:09:35.085]  That is the new senator-elect from Kentucky.
[01:09:36.300 --> 01:09:46.151]  Senator Rand Paul, someone who was demonized by the Republican Party when he was running against the establishment candidate in the primary.
[01:09:46.151 --> 01:09:52.038]  Someone who was demonized by the national media like no one in modern history.
[01:09:52.038 --> 01:09:55.221]  Someone who Bill Clinton campaigned against off and on for weeks.
[01:09:56.266 --> 01:10:04.158]  And Bill Clinton campaigning against him only gave him an additional 5 points on the polls where he was 10 points ahead.
[01:10:04.158 --> 01:10:08.304]  He went into the election with a 15 to 16 point lead Monday.
[01:10:08.304 --> 01:10:09.105]  He won by 10 points.
[01:10:10.506 --> 01:10:19.809]  We of course have had Bev Harris, election fraud investigator, there on the ground in Kentucky saying there was evidence of chicanery against Rand.
[01:10:19.809 --> 01:10:23.850]  Coming up, did Harry Reid steal Nevada?
[01:10:23.850 --> 01:10:25.410]  We're doing a Google search term today.
[01:10:25.410 --> 01:10:32.372]  You just type it into Google over and over again, you make the number one search term, then millions of additional people learn about it and the media starts reporting on it.
[01:10:32.372 --> 01:10:35.733]  The search term today is steal Nevada.
[01:10:35.733 --> 01:10:36.974]  Steal Nevada.
[01:10:37.794 --> 01:10:45.200]  And you can do a secondary search, read Steel Nevada.
[01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:50.624]  Very important to enter that into Google so that people will read this article I'm going to be covering.
[01:10:51.781 --> 01:11:04.024]  And we're going to be going over that in a moment, and then your phone calls, Kambron, John, Damon, Ray, Morgan, and others that are patiently holding.
[01:11:04.024 --> 01:11:09.685]  But the first thing I want to get to is a clip from MSNBC.
[01:11:09.685 --> 01:11:12.466]  They cut in during his live speech.
[01:11:13.439 --> 01:11:16.341]  It's from the same clip we were just showing you.
[01:11:16.341 --> 01:11:17.821]  And again, they're fear-mongering.
[01:11:17.821 --> 01:11:20.423]  They're not going to stop going after Rand Paul.
[01:11:20.423 --> 01:11:35.451]  He is now the figurehead of real patriotic Americans who want to cut taxes, control the border, repeal gun laws, repeal Obamacare, save the dollar, who are against the world government that's now openly being announced.
[01:11:37.128 --> 01:11:42.391]  Open announcement of devaluation of the dollar, a new global cashless currency.
[01:11:42.391 --> 01:11:48.113]  You'll still have your yen, your yuan, your dollar, your euro, your loonie.
[01:11:48.113 --> 01:11:56.318]  You'll still have your shekels, but they'll all be denominated and controlled by the private central banks, the big six who engineered this crisis.
[01:11:57.970 --> 01:12:01.833]  Clinton gets rid of Glass-Steagall with Republican help in 99.
[01:12:01.833 --> 01:12:05.436]  The private central banks are allowed to issue 1,500 plus trillion.
[01:12:05.436 --> 01:12:09.359]  The Washington Post says 600 trillion.
[01:12:09.359 --> 01:12:10.460]  Whatever, 600 trillion, 1.5 quadrillion.
[01:12:10.460 --> 01:12:12.621]  Some analysts say 2 quadrillion, 2,000 trillion.
[01:12:12.621 --> 01:12:14.723]  Excuse me, 1,500 trillion.
[01:12:23.874 --> 01:12:25.235]  Or 2,000 trillion.
[01:12:25.235 --> 01:12:27.117]  But you can debate these numbers all day.
[01:12:27.117 --> 01:12:29.699]  It's impossible to pay back.
[01:12:29.699 --> 01:12:31.520]  It's mathematically impossible.
[01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:40.047]  And the bankers on the way up, they get all the power, all the inside control, they get to buy up all the assets, buy up the companies, ship them overseas, buy off the political parties.
[01:12:40.047 --> 01:12:42.889]  We're fighting a tsunami of fraudulent money.
[01:12:42.889 --> 01:12:47.853]  And Rand Paul says, in the Fed, along with his father, Dr. Ron Paul, the Congressman,
[01:12:48.573 --> 01:12:59.463]  And that scares the system, and that's why Republican establishment and Democratic establishment came after him with everything they had, on and on and on, and they failed.
[01:12:59.463 --> 01:13:02.386]  It is now mainstream to be pro-Second Amendment.
[01:13:02.386 --> 01:13:06.129]  It is now mainstream to be anti-world government.
[01:13:06.129 --> 01:13:09.432]  The Republican establishment can't deny that exists anymore.
[01:13:09.432 --> 01:13:13.656]  Just to stay in office or to get re-elected, many of them, right here in Texas,
[01:13:14.887 --> 01:13:17.352]  Are actually speaking out against world government.
[01:13:17.352 --> 01:13:19.315]  Speaking out against dollar devaluation.
[01:13:20.885 --> 01:13:33.613]  Talking about Texas seceding Rick Perry, getting ready to run for president, when he's been an inside Bilderberg Group attendee, pushing NAFTA and GATT, the NAFTA superhighways, Gardasil forced inoculations.
[01:13:33.613 --> 01:13:35.194]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:13:35.194 --> 01:13:40.078]  The point is they're now forced to admit all this and pose as patriots.
[01:13:40.078 --> 01:13:43.400]  That shows how far we've come.
[01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:47.663]  That's why we're getting about three, four new affiliates every week now.
[01:13:47.663 --> 01:13:49.524]  We used to get a new affiliate every month or two.
[01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:55.325]  And then stations would change format so we were losing affiliates as fast as we got them.
[01:13:55.325 --> 01:14:01.511]  Now, this radio show, and as quote, radical as it is, we're now mainstream.
[01:14:01.511 --> 01:14:02.933]  We can save this country.
[01:14:02.933 --> 01:14:04.855]  We can reverse all this tyranny.
[01:14:04.855 --> 01:14:10.061]  We can get a hundred year reprieve like Nineveh.
[01:14:10.061 --> 01:14:12.604]  But are you going to be the Jonah that goes out and warns people?
[01:14:13.567 --> 01:14:19.713]  Or are you going to sit there on your hands and go to sleep now because the Republicans took the House?
[01:14:19.713 --> 01:14:22.935]  We don't know how many of these Tea Party candidates are real and how many aren't.
[01:14:22.935 --> 01:14:24.116]  We're going to be watching them.
[01:14:24.116 --> 01:14:25.618]  We're going to be tracking what they're doing.
[01:14:25.618 --> 01:14:35.346]  But going back to my economy issue, the Federal Reserve is set to announce in exactly one hour from now, it is now
[01:14:37.286 --> 01:14:39.588]  12.14 Central Standard Time, 1.15 Eastern.
[01:14:39.588 --> 01:14:48.055]  At 2.15 Eastern, 1.15 Central, 12.15 Mountain, 11.15 Pacific.
[01:14:48.055 --> 01:14:54.441]  They are set to announce what they've already told the world in the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times they're going to do.
[01:14:54.441 --> 01:14:59.866]  That the answer to our economic problems is quantitative easing of $100 billion.
[01:14:59.866 --> 01:15:02.168]  $50 to $100 billion or maybe more per month.
[01:15:03.240 --> 01:15:06.282]  Of the Federal Reserve buying U.S.
[01:15:06.282 --> 01:15:08.483]  Treasury notes.
[01:15:08.483 --> 01:15:10.664]  The Federal Reserve set the monetary policy.
[01:15:10.664 --> 01:15:14.425]  They make the profit off of all this free money they get.
[01:15:14.425 --> 01:15:25.431]  And despite the fact they've gotten tens of trillions of dollars of taxpayer money in the last two years, since the banker bailout takeover, since then,
[01:15:27.571 --> 01:15:41.760]  They have frozen that money to the public and pushed us into a depression while lying and saying unemployment is 9.6% when even economists on 60 Minutes say 17 plus percent nationwide, 22 in California.
[01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:49.305]  The economists we have on in big mainline institutions say it's 22 plus percent nationwide, 30 to 31 percent in California.
[01:15:49.725 --> 01:16:00.835]  And the globalist answer is carbon taxes on our economy when nobody else has to put them in place that would kill the economy and tax increases that we know will shut down the economy.
[01:16:00.835 --> 01:16:02.517]  That is the goal.
[01:16:02.517 --> 01:16:04.158]  Shut down the economy.
[01:16:04.158 --> 01:16:13.107]  Make you dependent on government and the select inter-coterie of corporations that have become powerful through their control of government and the corporate welfare.
[01:16:14.901 --> 01:16:20.684]  And so, Bill Clinton and the Democrats, along with some Republicans, get rid of Glass-Steagall in 1999.
[01:16:20.684 --> 01:16:23.325]  Bush expands it with Henry Paulson.
[01:16:23.325 --> 01:16:27.727]  Obama comes in, gets four times the Wall Street money.
[01:16:27.727 --> 01:16:28.867]  Four times!
[01:16:28.867 --> 01:16:34.350]  Five times the Goldman Sachs, but four times the overall Wall Street money that McCain got.
[01:16:34.350 --> 01:16:36.491]  But no, we're not saying McCain's good.
[01:16:36.491 --> 01:16:37.651]  He wasn't meant to win.
[01:16:37.651 --> 01:16:39.132]  He wasn't the Hollywood candidate.
[01:16:39.132 --> 01:16:40.433]  He was just as bad.
[01:16:40.433 --> 01:16:42.534]  They just thought he couldn't sell the agenda as well.
[01:16:43.410 --> 01:16:45.170]  Time for a fake change.
[01:16:45.170 --> 01:16:46.451]  That was a fake change.
[01:16:46.451 --> 01:16:48.411]  We don't know if this change is fake.
[01:16:48.411 --> 01:17:03.234]  We know it's partially fake, but we know there's some good elements there, and we know the issues they're covering are at least anti-New World Order and aren't, oh, we'll give you change, socialist healthcare, open borders, more wars.
[01:17:03.234 --> 01:17:07.995]  This, at least on the surface, they're having to talk the talk, showing the awakening.
[01:17:07.995 --> 01:17:08.855]  I keep going back to that.
[01:17:10.945 --> 01:17:30.752]  Obama accelerates the looting, started by Clinton, working in tandem with RINOs, Republican in name only, and now the talking point on CNN, MSNBC, CNBC, is Rand Paul is going to cause a depression.
[01:17:30.752 --> 01:17:38.815]  So they've denied we're going into a depression, now because some patriots have gotten in, they're going to try to discredit cutting taxes, discredit cutting spending,
[01:17:41.215 --> 01:17:49.520]  And say that this was all caused by Rand Paul, who won't be in office for two and a half months.
[01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:52.001]  He won't be sworn in until January, mid-January.
[01:17:53.786 --> 01:17:55.467]  But it's already his fault.
[01:17:55.467 --> 01:17:56.888]  That's the new talking point.
[01:17:56.888 --> 01:18:00.850]  They're going to blame us just like they did in 29.
[01:18:00.850 --> 01:18:01.890]  People saw what was happening.
[01:18:01.890 --> 01:18:02.411]  They got in.
[01:18:02.411 --> 01:18:03.611]  They put in reforms.
[01:18:03.611 --> 01:18:05.272]  The bankers had already started the implosion.
[01:18:05.272 --> 01:18:07.553]  They blamed it on the Patriots.
[01:18:07.553 --> 01:18:09.054]  They're going to try that again.
[01:18:09.054 --> 01:18:11.135]  I've told you they're ballgame.
[01:18:11.135 --> 01:18:12.316]  They're going for it.
[01:18:12.316 --> 01:18:19.960]  Now here is the clip from MSNBC cutting into Rand Paul's speech and blaming him for the economy.
[01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:20.260]  Here it is.
[01:18:24.720 --> 01:18:40.436]  Empowered, empowered to prevent us from raising the debt ceiling because it must be raised on a date certain at a particular time on the clock or the United States government goes into default if he filibusters the debt ceiling beyond that point.
[01:18:40.996 --> 01:18:56.031]  He can not only destroy the credit rating of the United States of America, he can wreak havoc on the world's financial markets and cause a worldwide depression with one consistent holding to principle, which is his notion.
[01:18:56.471 --> 01:18:58.833]  of the American government's relationship to debt.
[01:18:58.833 --> 01:19:01.994]  This, by the way, is a challenge for Boehner in the House, his worst challenge.
[01:19:01.994 --> 01:19:07.798]  He must, and he knows it, pass a debt ceiling increase in his Republican House of Representatives.
[01:19:07.798 --> 01:19:09.339]  He will do it.
[01:19:09.339 --> 01:19:12.841]  But Rand Paul can stop it by himself.
[01:19:12.841 --> 01:19:18.304]  But the Republicans look back at 1995, they look back at Newt Gingrich and the government shutdown, and they lessened this year.
[01:19:18.304 --> 01:19:21.706]  Before this year, the lesson was... The debt ceiling has always been raised.
[01:19:21.706 --> 01:19:24.608]  Right, but they look back at that government shutdown... Alright, stay there.
[01:19:24.608 --> 01:19:26.049]  Before this year, the lesson of that was,
[01:19:26.169 --> 01:19:28.510]  We're going to come back and finish the rest of it.
[01:19:28.510 --> 01:19:32.532]  So the Federal Reserve has destroyed our dollar by design.
[01:19:32.532 --> 01:19:35.913]  They're set to make the announcement to fully destroy it.
[01:19:35.913 --> 01:19:39.114]  And they're saying Rand Paul's doing it.
[01:19:39.114 --> 01:19:42.736]  It's all the big debt designed to not be able to be paid back.
[01:19:42.736 --> 01:19:44.517]  And their answer is go deeper into debt.
[01:19:45.413 --> 01:19:50.677]  So you can see how over-the-top, out-of-the-open these people are.
[01:19:50.677 --> 01:19:55.360]  They think their viewers are complete morons, are complete idiots.
[01:19:55.360 --> 01:19:56.921]  So you can see where this is going.
[01:19:56.921 --> 01:19:57.642]  We'll be right back.
[01:19:57.642 --> 01:19:58.042]  Stay with us.

[01:21:14.958 --> 01:21:17.379]  When I first joined, I was being sued.

[01:24:04.864 --> 01:24:07.946]  I don't have time to play all of this MSNBC hit piece.
[01:24:07.946 --> 01:24:09.547]  There's a bunch of other ones.
[01:24:09.547 --> 01:24:13.369]  They're all up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:24:13.369 --> 01:24:17.631]  But they go on to say his speech was dictatorial.
[01:24:17.631 --> 01:24:22.054]  How dare an elected representative say, look, we're done with the corruption in Washington.
[01:24:22.054 --> 01:24:26.156]  You're supposed to all be timid and tepid, not to rally people.
[01:24:26.156 --> 01:24:29.018]  And oh my gosh, you know, if he doesn't let us raise the debt,
[01:24:29.918 --> 01:24:33.220]  Obama spending more than all presidents before him combined.
[01:24:33.220 --> 01:24:33.660]  Why then?
[01:24:33.660 --> 01:24:35.521]  We're going to have a depression.
[01:24:35.521 --> 01:24:39.223]  This is the same thing Henry Paulson did on October 1st, 2008.
[01:24:39.223 --> 01:24:42.966]  And we had members of Congress on who were in the meetings.
[01:24:42.966 --> 01:24:46.308]  People couldn't believe it when the Congressman, two of them, told you.
[01:24:46.308 --> 01:24:49.389]  Then a year later, mainstream media talked to Paulson.
[01:24:49.389 --> 01:24:57.854]  He admitted he went into closed sessions of the Senate and House in closed committees and said, we're going to have martial law, blood in the streets, if you don't give us this $887 billion.
[01:25:00.046 --> 01:25:04.709]  But then Bloomberg's reported it's $23.7 and then another $5 billion on top of it.
[01:25:04.709 --> 01:25:06.451]  Trillion, excuse me.
[01:25:06.451 --> 01:25:12.215]  $23.7 trillion with another $5 trillion on top of it of money the Federal Reserve took.
[01:25:12.215 --> 01:25:14.056]  And they won't tell Congress where it is.
[01:25:14.056 --> 01:25:15.117]  So we can see where they're going.
[01:25:15.117 --> 01:25:17.298]  They're going to hold everybody hostage.
[01:25:17.298 --> 01:25:21.001]  It's not just the Communist Chinese that are the number one holders of our debt.
[01:25:21.001 --> 01:25:22.882]  Number two is the Federal Reserve.
[01:25:22.882 --> 01:25:26.945]  And starting today, they're going to accelerate the buying of our debt.
[01:25:26.945 --> 01:25:29.207]  The private Federal Reserve is going to buy
[01:25:30.421 --> 01:25:38.024]  Fifty to a hundred billion dollars a month of T-bills because foreign governments won't buy it because the dollar's being devalued by the Federal Reserve.
[01:25:39.721 --> 01:25:45.264]  They set policy to put us into this position and then they buy our debt to get control.
[01:25:45.264 --> 01:25:48.566]  Then they have their talking heads say, okay, you go ahead.
[01:25:48.566 --> 01:25:50.327]  You go ahead and try to go with Rand Paul.
[01:25:50.327 --> 01:25:51.748]  You go ahead and try to cut taxes.
[01:25:51.748 --> 01:25:53.369]  You go ahead and try to free spending.
[01:25:53.369 --> 01:25:55.210]  You go ahead and try to cut defense.
[01:25:55.210 --> 01:25:57.131]  We'll just accelerate the depression.
[01:25:57.131 --> 01:26:02.795]  The same threat from two years ago, two years and a month ago, 25 months ago.
[01:26:05.117 --> 01:26:07.699]  It's the same thing they did this year to give the Federal Reserve more power.
[01:26:07.699 --> 01:26:11.443]  Oh, it's a banking reform bill designed to shut down local banks.
[01:26:11.443 --> 01:26:12.704]  What does Rand Paul talk about?
[01:26:12.704 --> 01:26:14.506]  He talked about that last night on TV.
[01:26:14.506 --> 01:26:20.471]  He talked about how the EPA and others get to set their own laws outside of Congress.
[01:26:20.471 --> 01:26:22.393]  He's saying we're the representatives.
[01:26:22.393 --> 01:26:23.574]  That's going to stop.
[01:26:23.574 --> 01:26:24.996]  We're getting out of NAFTA and GATT.
[01:26:26.035 --> 01:26:27.856]  We're gonna abolish the Federal Reserve.
[01:26:27.856 --> 01:26:33.841]  The Federal Reserve goes, well, we teamed up with the Chinese, and we handed over the Panama Canal, and we've sold this country out.
[01:26:33.841 --> 01:26:34.602]  We own you.
[01:26:34.602 --> 01:26:36.323]  Go ahead and try it, Rand Paul.
[01:26:36.323 --> 01:26:44.690]  I'm gonna play some more of this, and then come back in a long segment and go to Cabrone, John, Damien, Ray, Morgan, and others that are patiently holding, but I need to get to this.
[01:26:44.690 --> 01:26:45.931]  Let's play the rest of this clip.
[01:26:45.931 --> 01:26:46.231]  Here it is.
[01:26:46.431 --> 01:26:55.294]  But the Republicans look back at 1995, they look back at Newt Gingrich and the government shutdown, and they lesson this year, before this year, the lesson was... The debt ceiling has always been raised.
[01:26:55.294 --> 01:27:01.397]  Right, but they look back at that government shutdown and they think, before this year the lesson of that was, oh, the Republicans went too far.
[01:27:01.397 --> 01:27:07.639]  This year, Republicans' lesson on that was, we should have gone farther, we should have held it closed for longer.
[01:27:07.639 --> 01:27:10.060]  They're going to look at that, they've already been talking about this, they're going to look at that.
[01:27:10.100 --> 01:27:13.022]  That is nothing compared to the debt ceiling vote.
[01:27:13.022 --> 01:27:17.145]  I know, but the Republican rhetoric around this cannot be underestimated.
[01:27:17.145 --> 01:27:23.310]  People as centrist in the Republican Party as Michael Steele have said there will be no compromise on that debt ceiling vote.
[01:27:23.310 --> 01:27:27.013]  Mike Lee of Utah, Rand Paul of Kentucky, it is not just one guy.
[01:27:27.213 --> 01:27:29.656]  Michael Steele doesn't understand what it is.
[01:27:29.656 --> 01:27:32.739]  He's the same guy who didn't know what the minimum wage was when I asked him.
[01:27:32.739 --> 01:27:44.111]  They do not comprehend the worldwide economic depression that would be caused instantaneously by the United States government defaulting on its debt, which they are empowered to make.
[01:27:44.111 --> 01:27:45.072]  They salivated at the thought of it.
[01:27:45.072 --> 01:27:46.233]  Mitch McConnell understands it.
[01:27:47.369 --> 01:27:54.556]  They're defaulting now by monetizing the debt that's been going on for two years, and that they're going to accelerate today.
[01:27:54.556 --> 01:28:02.084]  They're defaulting, that's why people aren't buying the Treasury notes anymore, because the word's out that they're going to torch the dollar.
[01:28:02.084 --> 01:28:05.888]  There they are, the ones guilty of it, trying to blame Rand Paul.
[01:28:05.888 --> 01:28:06.469]  Continue!
[01:28:07.819 --> 01:28:09.719]  So, Mitch McConnell understands it.
[01:28:09.719 --> 01:28:11.660]  And he kind of understands Rand Paul.
[01:28:11.660 --> 01:28:12.340]  A little bit.
[01:28:12.340 --> 01:28:13.580]  Kind of.
[01:28:13.580 --> 01:28:15.981]  Do you think Mitch McConnell won't let him do it?
[01:28:15.981 --> 01:28:21.002]  Well, I think he will try his best to find a way to keep him from doing it.
[01:28:21.002 --> 01:28:26.604]  And Mitch McConnell is about as good as anybody in the world at the
[01:28:28.304 --> 01:28:32.167]  Buy ways and techniques of the Senate.
[01:28:32.167 --> 01:28:33.608]  He's really, really good.
[01:28:33.608 --> 01:28:35.209]  Rand Paul can vote against it.
[01:28:35.209 --> 01:28:36.990]  You only need 51 votes to pass it.
[01:28:36.990 --> 01:28:40.572]  But Rand Paul is empowered to filibuster it.
[01:28:40.572 --> 01:28:41.393]  Will he?
[01:28:41.393 --> 01:28:43.814]  His principles say he must.
[01:28:43.814 --> 01:28:51.119]  It certainly would cut to the chase in terms of getting government off your back, since there wouldn't be one that would simplify things considerably.
[01:28:51.119 --> 01:28:52.860]  Not just this government, governments around the world.
[01:28:52.860 --> 01:28:53.881]  That's my point.
[01:28:53.881 --> 01:28:54.762]  So, in fact,
[01:28:55.362 --> 01:28:56.223]  That's anarchy.
[01:28:56.223 --> 01:29:05.648]  I believe there used to be, before we threw the word communist out at people that we did not like, we threw the word anarchist out at them in the late 19th century.
[01:29:05.648 --> 01:29:11.771]  And you're suggesting that this is what could be on the table if Mr. Paul were, in fact, Senator-elect Paul, were to, in fact, take that position.
[01:29:11.771 --> 01:29:12.592]  This is a real question.
[01:29:12.592 --> 01:29:19.436]  Lawrence is raising this not as, I think, as hyperbole, but this is an issue that they're really seriously debating on the right.
[01:29:19.436 --> 01:29:23.478]  This is the only person I'm aware of who will take the oath of office as a United States Senator who
[01:29:23.558 --> 01:29:23.998]  That's enough.
[01:29:23.998 --> 01:29:25.079]  And they go on to demonize.
[01:29:25.079 --> 01:29:26.680]  It goes on and on.
[01:29:26.680 --> 01:29:27.520]  But you gotta love it.
[01:29:27.520 --> 01:29:29.021]  They've put us in this position.
[01:29:29.021 --> 01:29:31.802]  They're defaulting on the debt by devaluing.
[01:29:31.802 --> 01:29:33.123]  The country's falling apart.
[01:29:33.123 --> 01:29:34.503]  We're in a depression.
[01:29:34.503 --> 01:29:41.207]  And they sit up there and lie to their viewers and try to blame it on anybody that tries to set the country back on the right course.
[01:29:41.207 --> 01:29:42.887]  They're gonna hold this nation hostage.
[01:29:42.887 --> 01:29:44.948]  The Federal Reserve's the second biggest owner.
[01:29:44.948 --> 01:29:46.689]  They're about to become the biggest owner.
[01:29:46.689 --> 01:29:47.890]  They're making that announcement today.
[01:29:51.175 --> 01:29:55.097]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.097 --> 01:30:00.919]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.919 --> 01:30:02.560]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.

[01:31:00.523 --> 01:31:05.067]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:31:05.067 --> 01:31:05.987]  Number 1.
[01:31:05.987 --> 01:31:09.410]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:31:09.410 --> 01:31:10.271]  Number 2.
[01:31:10.271 --> 01:31:15.154]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:31:15.154 --> 01:31:15.895]  It's true.
[01:31:15.895 --> 01:31:20.779]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:31:20.779 --> 01:31:21.599]  Number 3.
[01:31:21.599 --> 01:31:25.182]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:31:25.182 --> 01:31:28.865]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:31:29.085 --> 01:31:29.886]  Number 4.
[01:31:29.886 --> 01:31:32.648]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:31:32.648 --> 01:31:36.330]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:31:36.330 --> 01:31:37.111]  Number 5.
[01:31:37.111 --> 01:31:41.254]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:31:41.254 --> 01:31:46.017]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:31:46.317 --> 01:31:50.481]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:31:50.481 --> 01:31:52.263]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:31:52.263 --> 01:31:54.525]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:31:54.525 --> 01:31:56.868]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:32:00.672 --> 01:32:04.255]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[01:32:04.255 --> 01:32:05.556]  It ended on June of 2009.
[01:32:05.556 --> 01:32:09.960]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[01:32:09.960 --> 01:32:15.906]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[01:32:15.906 --> 01:32:18.047]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[01:32:18.047 --> 01:32:20.730]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[01:32:21.070 --> 01:32:27.576]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[01:32:27.576 --> 01:32:29.778]  They both make fabulous investments.
[01:32:29.778 --> 01:32:35.122]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[01:32:35.122 --> 01:32:40.427]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[01:32:40.427 --> 01:32:45.551]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long-term.
[01:32:45.771 --> 01:32:48.973]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[01:32:48.973 --> 01:32:51.975]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[01:32:51.975 --> 01:32:52.816]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[01:32:52.816 --> 01:32:55.438]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:32:55.438 --> 01:32:56.378]  Okay, we're going to your phone calls.
[01:33:14.090 --> 01:33:17.031]  But I first just want to be specific about this.
[01:33:17.031 --> 01:33:42.217]  When the Federal Reserve creates hundreds of thousands of billions of false debt that they can buy things up with and then leaves us holding the bag and is raising our taxes to pay it off and is now monetizing the debt and openly devaluing the dollar, that rips off everyone that's invested in dollars, including American citizens that have money in the bank.
[01:33:43.260 --> 01:33:45.066]  And it makes the cost of living go up.
[01:33:45.066 --> 01:33:48.135]  And it makes your social security not go as far.
[01:33:48.135 --> 01:33:49.378]  They've already frozen the cola.
[01:33:51.897 --> 01:33:53.738]  And they think you're stupid.
[01:33:53.738 --> 01:33:57.741]  And there's this religion by fake liberals to go, look at this Republican.
[01:33:57.741 --> 01:33:58.862]  He's stupid.
[01:33:58.862 --> 01:34:00.843]  He doesn't know what the minimum wage is.
[01:34:00.843 --> 01:34:05.166]  And it's like this cult of feeling smart and knowing everything.
[01:34:05.166 --> 01:34:07.748]  It's just pure idiocy.
[01:34:07.748 --> 01:34:11.090]  And there's been this Republican cult of there's no world government.
[01:34:11.090 --> 01:34:13.031]  There's no private fellow reserve.
[01:34:13.031 --> 01:34:15.173]  There's no banking cartel.
[01:34:15.173 --> 01:34:17.074]  Kooks talk about that.
[01:34:17.074 --> 01:34:19.135]  We have a kook detector.
[01:34:19.135 --> 01:34:21.637]  And anybody that talks about it is a nutball.
[01:34:23.157 --> 01:34:28.479]  If Patriot Ideas would have not been suppressed in the last 20 years, we'd never be here.
[01:34:28.479 --> 01:34:29.760]  But now we're here.
[01:34:29.760 --> 01:34:31.240]  People have seen that we've been right.
[01:34:31.240 --> 01:34:33.221]  They're waking up in droves.
[01:34:33.221 --> 01:34:36.182]  They're waking up big time.
[01:34:36.182 --> 01:34:40.744]  Now, I want to go to your phone calls, but I didn't ever get to this yesterday.
[01:34:40.744 --> 01:34:45.205]  And then we're going to your calls right into the next hour for everybody that is patiently holding.
[01:34:45.205 --> 01:34:46.526]  But we've got a video clip.
[01:34:48.021 --> 01:35:00.387]  of a television commercial that Citizens Against Government Waste has been deemed too controversial by major networks including ABC, A&E, and the History Channel and will not be shown on those channels.
[01:35:00.387 --> 01:35:12.713]  The commercial is a homage to a 1986 ad that was entitled The Deficit Trials, which was also banned because major networks apparently telling the truth about the national debt is a little too hot for the major networks to handle.
[01:35:13.513 --> 01:35:16.476]  Now, this is set in 2030.
[01:35:16.476 --> 01:35:19.119]  It shouldn't be offensive.
[01:35:19.119 --> 01:35:23.043]  The truth is, the ad does not even have anything in it that should be offensive.
[01:35:23.043 --> 01:35:27.407]  The commercial is set in the year 2030, and the main character is a Chinese professor.
[01:35:27.407 --> 01:35:30.891]  They actually have Chinese professors now, and government heads that talk like this.
[01:35:32.435 --> 01:35:42.281]  The Chinese professor is seen lecturing his students on the fall of great empires as images of the United States are shown on a screen behind him.
[01:35:42.281 --> 01:35:47.864]  The Chinese professor tells his students the following about the behavior of great empires.
[01:35:47.864 --> 01:35:53.168]  They all make the same mistakes, turning their backs on the principles that made them great.
[01:35:53.168 --> 01:35:56.229]  America tried to spend and tax itself out of the Great Recession.
[01:35:57.250 --> 01:36:04.793]  Enormous so-called stimulus spending, massive changes to health care, government takeover of private industries, and crushing debt.
[01:36:04.793 --> 01:36:11.495]  He goes on to say, of course, we own most of their debt, so now they work for us.
[01:36:11.495 --> 01:36:16.537]  It's a very well done ad, and unless you speak Chinese you won't understand it, but I'm gonna play it.
[01:36:16.537 --> 01:36:20.559]  I've already read to you the text, and the Chinese students laugh at the end of it.
[01:36:21.701 --> 01:36:34.087]  Well, it's the Federal Reserve and the international bankers that made these deals with China 20 years ago to de-industrialize us, to put tariffs and taxes on us here so we couldn't have jobs, but no tariffs and taxes in China.
[01:36:34.952 --> 01:36:49.199]  And they positioned us, and now the Federal Reserve is set, within just four months, the Wall Street Journal estimates, with QE2, monetizing debt, buying our debt, to be bigger owners than the Communist Chinese.
[01:36:49.199 --> 01:36:54.882]  So the Communist Chinese, with the private banks, have positioned us to be debtor slaves, to own us.
[01:36:54.882 --> 01:36:56.383]  So we work for them through fraud.
[01:36:57.250 --> 01:37:00.471]  That's why all your taxes, state, local, federal, are going up.
[01:37:00.471 --> 01:37:08.292]  It's why these big central banks are calling for the new global currency that you've got to pay a national VAT tax to them on, and carbon taxes on.
[01:37:08.292 --> 01:37:15.154]  This is where we're already at, basically, unless we say no to the fraud and no to this banking system.
[01:37:15.154 --> 01:37:16.514]  It's not in 2030.
[01:37:16.514 --> 01:37:18.955]  The Chinese are already talking like this.
[01:37:18.955 --> 01:37:19.355]  Here it is.
[01:37:25.353 --> 01:37:28.576]  Why are all the powerful countries heading towards extinction?
[01:37:28.576 --> 01:37:38.364]  Ancient Greece, the Roman Empire, the Hryvnia Empire, the United States.
[01:37:38.364 --> 01:37:43.209]  Because they all made the same mistakes, the principles that made them successful turned against them.
[01:37:45.143 --> 01:37:46.063]  So now they work for us.
[01:38:13.430 --> 01:38:15.232]  You can change the future.
[01:38:15.232 --> 01:38:16.454]  You have to.
[01:38:16.454 --> 01:38:20.779]  Join Citizens Against Government Waste to stop the spending that is bankrupting America.
[01:38:21.561 --> 01:38:23.301]  And we're going to get them on next week.
[01:38:23.301 --> 01:38:24.062]  That's a great ad.
[01:38:24.062 --> 01:38:25.942]  We need to see more of that.
[01:38:25.942 --> 01:38:27.443]  And that's, you know, nonpartisan.
[01:38:27.443 --> 01:38:28.643]  It just covers the facts.
[01:38:28.643 --> 01:38:30.143]  So, I've said it.
[01:38:30.143 --> 01:38:30.744]  I've covered it.
[01:38:30.744 --> 01:38:32.524]  I want to take a bunch of your calls.
[01:38:32.524 --> 01:38:35.965]  The next hour, I'm plunging into all the latest election news.
[01:38:35.965 --> 01:38:38.406]  And did Harry Reid steal Nevada?
[01:38:38.406 --> 01:38:42.647]  Was the governorship stolen in Colorado from Tom Tancredo?
[01:38:42.647 --> 01:38:46.708]  There's evidence on all of those major fronts.
[01:38:49.787 --> 01:38:52.631]  We've got another report here out of CBS News.
[01:38:52.631 --> 01:38:55.394]  Large majority of candidates Sarah Palin backed won.
[01:38:56.636 --> 01:39:02.818]  Well, there's a reason she's in Iowa every other week.
[01:39:02.818 --> 01:39:05.439]  Palin emerges with even more clout.
[01:39:05.439 --> 01:39:09.180]  And yes, they're positioning her to run with Rick Perry.
[01:39:09.180 --> 01:39:10.360]  That's inside baseball.
[01:39:10.360 --> 01:39:12.721]  I told you that a year ago.
[01:39:12.721 --> 01:39:16.722]  Now, they're openly talking about it here in Austin, where Perry's at, on the news.
[01:39:16.722 --> 01:39:23.224]  And Perry told the AP two days ago, don't be surprised if I've only governed her for two years on my four-year term.
[01:39:23.224 --> 01:39:24.905]  He's got a book out called Fed Up.
[01:39:26.035 --> 01:39:26.475]  Thank you Alex.
[01:39:26.475 --> 01:39:28.997]  First I'd like to say, yes, thank you.
[01:39:28.997 --> 01:39:30.659]  First I'd like to say,
[01:39:55.049 --> 01:39:58.450]  Thank you and your team for being such factual reporters.
[01:39:58.450 --> 01:40:00.370]  It's very rare you find that.
[01:40:00.370 --> 01:40:19.095]  The second thing is, on a website I found about a voter fraud in California where Bill Clinton is sending out letters to illegal immigrants and with a PS below it says, below that letter is a PS that explains
[01:40:19.929 --> 01:40:22.271]  Here is your personal voter identification card.
[01:40:22.271 --> 01:40:24.253]  Sign your name, then detach your card.
[01:40:24.253 --> 01:40:28.978]  Bring your card with you to your polling place on election day.
[01:40:28.978 --> 01:40:32.782]  It will help you and your voting go more smoothly.
[01:40:32.782 --> 01:40:35.705]  And this person is not a registered voter and is an illegal immigrant.
[01:40:38.025 --> 01:40:44.408]  Well, we know in Arizona and other places federal courts ruled illegal aliens can vote.
[01:40:44.408 --> 01:40:47.190]  They don't need any identification, any proof of citizenship.
[01:40:47.190 --> 01:40:48.910]  So we know this is going on.
[01:40:48.910 --> 01:40:51.231]  I haven't seen what you're talking about.
[01:40:51.231 --> 01:40:55.613]  Can you send it to ShowTips at InfoWars.com right now?
[01:40:55.613 --> 01:40:57.814]  What's the headline on the article?
[01:40:57.814 --> 01:41:00.956]  I actually sent it in to you guys and I got the ticket number.
[01:41:00.956 --> 01:41:03.497]  If you guys want to pull that ticket number up, you can go right to it.
[01:41:03.497 --> 01:41:04.377]  Sure, give me the ticket number.
[01:41:06.997 --> 01:41:07.838]  Hey look, it's just easier.
[01:41:07.838 --> 01:41:11.561]  Just give me the headline on the article.
[01:41:11.561 --> 01:41:12.963]  Well, the ticket number is 224886.
[01:41:12.963 --> 01:41:15.745]  Let me get the article pulled up again.
[01:41:15.745 --> 01:41:15.885]  It's 224886?
[01:41:15.885 --> 01:41:16.045]  Yeah.
[01:41:22.270 --> 01:41:29.076]  The article is from World Net Daily and it's called Voter Fraud Again by Joseph Farah, between the lines.
[01:41:29.076 --> 01:41:31.018]  Yeah, well that's credible then.
[01:41:31.018 --> 01:41:33.961]  They're pretty credible when it comes to reporting on election stuff.
[01:41:33.961 --> 01:41:37.605]  Voter Fraud Again, Joseph Farah, we'll pull it up right now.
[01:41:37.605 --> 01:41:40.027]  That is just outrageous, if that's true.
[01:41:40.027 --> 01:41:41.889]  Anything else, sir?
[01:41:41.889 --> 01:41:45.172]  No, like I said, thank you all for everything you've done for us.
[01:41:45.762 --> 01:41:46.542]  Well, no, thank you.
[01:41:46.542 --> 01:41:47.663]  We're all in this together.
[01:41:47.663 --> 01:41:48.704]  People always thank me.
[01:41:48.704 --> 01:41:48.984]  Why?
[01:41:48.984 --> 01:41:55.427]  Oh, by the way, we do try to be accurate, and we're accurate, I'd say, 95% of the time.
[01:41:55.427 --> 01:42:01.351]  But all the time when I listen to rebroadcast, I hear things I say that I know are incorrect.
[01:42:02.276 --> 01:42:02.556]  I don't know.
[01:42:23.581 --> 01:42:28.706]  That's because I was reading a headline, Silver Breaks All-Time High in 30 Years Since 1980.
[01:42:28.706 --> 01:42:31.048]  That was the second greatest high.
[01:42:31.048 --> 01:42:33.270]  For a short period, it went to 50.
[01:42:33.270 --> 01:42:37.414]  But its next high, and for only like a day or two, its next high was 25 and change.
[01:42:37.414 --> 01:42:40.397]  So it did break its next to greatest record.
[01:42:40.397 --> 01:42:43.700]  And then I'm listening to a rebroadcast, I just happened to click on it for five minutes to listen.
[01:42:43.700 --> 01:42:47.443]  I kind of spot-checked the show at night, and I was like, well that's wrong, it went to 50.
[01:42:48.844 --> 01:42:52.167]  So, I gotta correct myself on that front.
[01:42:52.167 --> 01:42:59.292]  And if you do hear us say something that's wrong, we want you to email us or call us, because I want to correct myself.
[01:42:59.292 --> 01:43:01.874]  Just like I tried to say silver, I said gold.
[01:43:01.874 --> 01:43:04.657]  I mean, it's just, I don't have teleprompters.
[01:43:04.657 --> 01:43:10.001]  I mean, I'm here with all the news, the info, for three hours, some days four, five hours live.
[01:43:10.001 --> 01:43:15.185]  Sometimes we go into overdrive, and we get things wrong sometimes, but we always correct it when we find it.
[01:43:15.185 --> 01:43:16.506]  Let's talk to John in Texas.
[01:43:16.506 --> 01:43:17.307]  John, thanks for holding.
[01:43:18.612 --> 01:43:19.252]  Hi, Alex.
[01:43:19.252 --> 01:43:20.053]  Hey, buddy.
[01:43:20.053 --> 01:43:22.995]  You know, yesterday we got a glimmer of hope.
[01:43:22.995 --> 01:43:30.580]  But we can never forget that the power structure that murdered 3,000 people at the World Trade Center without batting an eye is still there.
[01:43:30.580 --> 01:43:33.882]  And the more that their power is threatened, the more dangerous they're going to become.
[01:43:33.882 --> 01:43:34.883]  Well, that's right.
[01:43:34.883 --> 01:43:38.705]  And Anwar al-Awlaki, Fox News, the head of Al Qaeda, No.
[01:43:38.705 --> 01:43:40.406]  3 to bin Laden, now No.
[01:43:40.406 --> 01:43:46.250]  1, was dining secretly at the Pentagon two months after 9-11 when he was on the news as the spiritual leader
[01:43:46.710 --> 01:43:51.111]  And Alex, we can never forget about the politicians that crossed paths with the New World Order before and what happened.
[01:43:51.111 --> 01:43:51.571]  John Kennedy,
[01:44:15.942 --> 01:44:23.165]  Well, but see, 20, 30 years ago, 30 years ago with Reagan, 40-something years ago, almost 50 with Kennedy, people
[01:44:36.345 --> 01:44:37.625]  I think you're right about Rick Perry.
[01:45:03.652 --> 01:45:18.781]  Yesterday I voted straight Libertarian, I just couldn't vote for the Republicans and Rick Perry, but I think he's being set up as the next wolf in sheep's clothing, the new Messiah, conservative savior, along with Sarah Palin, and we're going to have to try to expose him.
[01:45:19.261 --> 01:45:20.981]  You know his history.
[01:45:20.981 --> 01:45:29.824]  He was the secondary little minion that Karl Rove basically groomed, and he is Karl Rove's man.
[01:45:29.824 --> 01:45:44.807]  And I was told by a high-powered politico of National Import who was in a private meeting with Rick Perry, and Rick Perry said that he was worried about Ron Paul and Alex Jones.
[01:45:44.807 --> 01:45:48.368]  That's who he was worried about and who he's scared of.
[01:45:49.048 --> 01:45:50.709]  Why would he be scared of Ron Paul?
[01:45:50.709 --> 01:45:53.011]  Because that's who can beat him in 2012.
[01:45:53.011 --> 01:45:55.092]  Why would he be scared of an Alex Jones?
[01:45:55.092 --> 01:46:07.360]  Because he knows... Listen, when I premiered Endgame three and a half years ago in Austin at the Alamo Draft House, Rick Perry's press secretary showed up at the event and said, Oh, the governor likes you.
[01:46:07.360 --> 01:46:09.702]  Oh, he wanted to see what you got on him at Bilderberg.
[01:46:11.625 --> 01:46:13.426]  I mean, folks, Rick Perry is watching me.
[01:46:13.426 --> 01:46:15.286]  Remember that time Rick Perry was on the show?
[01:46:15.286 --> 01:46:21.408]  Because one of our guests happened to be down at the Capitol, and we were getting a report from the Capitol, and, oh, here's Rick Perry.
[01:46:21.408 --> 01:46:23.929]  And it was Rick Perry, and he called me a big fat hog and all that.
[01:46:23.929 --> 01:46:28.210]  In fact, guys, go to YouTube and type Rick Perry on Alex Jones Show.
[01:46:28.210 --> 01:46:28.910]  Maybe we should play that.
[01:46:28.910 --> 01:46:30.791]  And he goes, you're a big fat hog.
[01:46:30.791 --> 01:46:34.672]  I'm like, yeah, remember that time I bullhorned you in Vicente Fox and shut down your little meeting?
[01:46:34.672 --> 01:46:38.033]  And he goes, yeah, I remember you were sweating like a big old fat hog.
[01:46:40.612 --> 01:47:02.918]  I mean, Perry hates my guts, and he knows how to put on a West Texas accent and talk about shooting coyotes in Austin, and, ooh, I might have to secede when I'm not telling you you gotta take Gardasil, it's deadly, the vaccine, and when I'm not pushing NAFTA highways or Bilderberg power company handovers, when I'm not at Bilderberg group meetings, well, I'm rooting, tooting Yosemite Sam, boy!
[01:47:02.918 --> 01:47:04.438]  I'm gonna... Anything else, John?
[01:47:05.891 --> 01:47:08.792]  No, just that he's such a fraud and I just hope people see through him.
[01:47:08.792 --> 01:47:10.093]  That's all I got, Alex.
[01:47:10.093 --> 01:47:13.034]  Thank you, but people say, well, he's better than Obama!
[01:47:13.034 --> 01:47:15.976]  Really, if Obama stayed in, the whole country'd wake up!
[01:47:15.976 --> 01:47:17.717]  Obama's a lame duck!
[01:47:17.717 --> 01:47:20.698]  The last thing we want is a fake Republican president!
[01:47:20.698 --> 01:47:23.099]  It's Ron Paul or nobody!
[01:47:23.099 --> 01:47:25.280]  He's the only one with a perfect voting record!
[01:47:25.280 --> 01:47:26.941]  He's the only one that never flip-flops!
[01:47:28.516 --> 01:47:33.018]  Sure, vote for good Republicans if they've got a patriotic, you know, anti-new order record locally.
[01:47:33.018 --> 01:47:36.339]  But let me tell you something, Rick Perry, Sarah Palin, give me a break, folks.
[01:47:36.339 --> 01:47:38.880]  Henry Kissinger's behind her.
[01:47:38.880 --> 01:47:41.862]  And her rhetoric gets better and better.
[01:47:41.862 --> 01:47:45.123]  But still, I don't trust her.
[01:47:45.123 --> 01:47:46.744]  I don't trust Glenn Beck.
[01:47:46.744 --> 01:47:49.645]  Let's go ahead and talk to Damien in South Carolina.
[01:47:49.645 --> 01:47:51.786]  You're on the air.
[01:47:51.786 --> 01:47:52.746]  Hey, how you doing?
[01:47:52.746 --> 01:47:53.107]  Good, sir.
[01:47:53.107 --> 01:47:53.847]  What's on your mind today?
[01:47:54.864 --> 01:47:56.866]  Well, I wanted to talk to you about a couple quick things.
[01:47:56.866 --> 01:48:05.915]  First of all, yesterday, my good friend and co-worker, she's a poll manager, and we're in the 6th District, which was Jim Clyburn.
[01:48:05.915 --> 01:48:06.816]  That's his district.
[01:48:06.816 --> 01:48:07.877]  He's the House Majority Whip.
[01:48:08.439 --> 01:48:11.601]  Yeah, the depression hadn't gotten good enough for him yet.
[01:48:36.184 --> 01:48:47.694]  And this district was gerrymandered and cut out for Jim Clyburn to basically, you know, appease that part of the demographics.
[01:48:47.694 --> 01:48:56.021]  And the people who live there who are not part of that demographic are just like, oh well, I guess I'll just have, you know, the feds dictate to me who my representative is going to be.
[01:48:56.021 --> 01:48:57.342]  People just don't come out and vote.
[01:48:57.342 --> 01:48:59.063]  I was calling people for the last two months.
[01:48:59.063 --> 01:49:00.605]  Let me ask you this question.
[01:49:00.605 --> 01:49:03.107]  What do you think of the evidence of Harry Reid stealing Nevada?
[01:49:03.832 --> 01:49:05.033]  Oh, it's rampant.
[01:49:05.033 --> 01:49:11.519]  I mean, Alex, you hit the nail on the head two seconds ago when you said the depression hasn't hit bad enough.
[01:49:11.519 --> 01:49:21.048]  We're gonna need, you know, unemployment to be like 80% before people realize, you know, if they're not like fluoride-headed enough to... And when it's 80% of it ever did hit that, the media will say it's 15%.
[01:49:22.189 --> 01:49:29.136]  Yeah, or they'll say it's 10 and we're in a recovery, but the ridiculous nature of it all is that we had a real possibility.
[01:49:29.136 --> 01:49:41.549]  He lost basically 52,000 to 82,000 to Clyburn, and he basically, if all the people who should have gotten behind him and supported him, that say on paper they do,
[01:49:43.030 --> 01:49:48.194]  We would have beat him, but the GOP never got behind that candidate because they didn't want him to beat.
[01:49:48.194 --> 01:49:49.335]  No, no, exactly!
[01:49:49.335 --> 01:50:03.866]  They have their mainline candidates pose as tea partiers and in every case they either campaign against real patriots or they just give no support so the Democrat wins because they love... the Republicans have been part of all of what's happened.
[01:50:04.506 --> 01:50:05.046]  Absolutely.
[01:50:21.204 --> 01:50:25.608]  Obama, as I predicted two years ago, has been built up and destroyed.
[01:50:25.608 --> 01:50:29.071]  And people said, some people I know said, how dare you say that?
[01:50:29.071 --> 01:50:30.372]  You know, he's the Messiah.
[01:50:30.372 --> 01:50:31.673]  Or they said, oh, he's a bad guy.
[01:50:31.673 --> 01:50:32.894]  He's dangerous.
[01:50:32.894 --> 01:50:34.455]  He's going to be a dictator.
[01:50:34.455 --> 01:50:41.562]  And I said, look, that guy is being built up to be destroyed and have everything the globalists do blamed on him.
[01:50:42.702 --> 01:50:43.843]  And now you see it.
[01:50:43.843 --> 01:50:46.927]  Here's Obama, MSNBC, AP as well.
[01:50:46.927 --> 01:50:50.831]  Obama to take responsibility for voter frustration.
[01:50:50.831 --> 01:50:53.754]  He's gonna take the responsibility.
[01:50:53.754 --> 01:50:55.696]  Again, it's all about Obama.
[01:50:55.696 --> 01:50:57.518]  The Glass-Steagall Act, it's all his fault.
[01:50:57.518 --> 01:50:58.579]  Everything's his fault.
[01:50:58.579 --> 01:50:59.120]  We'll be right back.
[01:51:01.104 --> 01:51:02.405]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:02.405 --> 01:51:07.990]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:07.990 --> 01:51:13.014]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:13.014 --> 01:51:18.598]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:51:18.598 --> 01:51:20.420]  So our friends at Solutions from Science
[01:51:20.680 --> 01:51:21.180]  We're good to go!
[01:51:48.800 --> 01:51:52.947]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:51:52.947 --> 01:51:57.774]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:51:57.774 --> 01:52:00.158]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:00.646 --> 01:52:03.447]  Are you concerned about dropping or losing your cell phone?
[01:52:03.447 --> 01:52:06.208]  Are you tired of dealing with cell phone clips or holsters?

[01:53:00.532 --> 01:53:02.593]  As gardeners, we can all relate.

[01:54:07.571 --> 01:54:13.033]  All right, we're back live, continuing with your phone calls in the next hour.
[01:54:13.033 --> 01:54:17.856]  Ryan, Morgan, Mike, Ronnie, John, and others, toll-free number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[01:54:23.317 --> 01:54:23.617]  U.S.
[01:54:23.617 --> 01:54:27.821]  stocks drop after election as investors await Fed decision.
[01:54:27.821 --> 01:54:30.904]  See, that's who really owns this country through fraud.
[01:54:30.904 --> 01:54:34.146]  And they're set to make that announcement in the next 20 minutes or so.
[01:54:34.146 --> 01:54:38.730]  We'll be watching that here live for everyone.
[01:54:38.730 --> 01:54:42.153]  European stocks in lower ahead of Fed announcement as well.
[01:54:42.153 --> 01:54:46.317]  That's out of the Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg Financial.
[01:54:46.977 --> 01:54:49.519]  I want to get into this police state grid.
[01:54:49.519 --> 01:54:57.505]  You know, politicians come and go, but this surveillance system, so the criminal state and the corporations that run it, can basically have their way with us.
[01:54:57.505 --> 01:55:07.572]  I want to hit on that, and also that World Net Daily story, voter fraud again, with the illegal aliens being sent their little voter registration cards.
[01:55:07.572 --> 01:55:09.374]  You've got to love that.
[01:55:09.374 --> 01:55:13.157]  See, when you have a totally corrupt state like California, they can just get away with whatever they want.
[01:55:13.977 --> 01:55:20.121]  And Republicans let them do it, the establishment does, because they're engaged in their own fraud in states they control.
[01:55:20.121 --> 01:55:24.164]  But continuing here, well that shows the beauty of the Founding Fathers' minds.
[01:55:24.164 --> 01:55:33.470]  They knew tyranny would come, but by having two different parties, three different branches of government, they knew that groups would still fight with each other over the tyranny, and never really get a pure tyranny in place.
[01:55:33.470 --> 01:55:42.456]  But the British scientific model of tyranny was developed to have their empire spread worldwide, not run by the British people, but by those elites, to do it from behind the scenes.
[01:55:42.816 --> 01:55:44.224]  We're going to cover that here in just a moment.
[01:55:47.591 --> 01:55:53.136]  First, I'll tell you about some of our wonderful sponsors, like MySolarBackup.com.
[01:55:53.136 --> 01:55:55.778]  Have you lost your power and wanted to simply flip a switch and get the lights back on?
[01:55:55.778 --> 01:55:58.440]  If so, you should check out MySolarBackup.com.
[01:55:58.440 --> 01:56:02.584]  There's never been a better time to start getting off the grid and generate your own supply of electrical power.
[01:56:02.584 --> 01:56:03.405]  Here's why.
[01:56:03.405 --> 01:56:09.690]  Plug-and-play wonderful generators that have been offered for three years and our listeners love from Solutions from Science are available.
[01:56:09.690 --> 01:56:14.334]  These portable power systems need no installation and supply household current whenever and wherever you need it.
[01:56:14.514 --> 01:56:14.934]  We're good to go.
[01:56:35.319 --> 01:56:39.202]  They get a free information package by calling 877-327-0365.
[01:56:39.202 --> 01:56:44.805]  That's 877-327-0365 or mysolarbackup.com.
[01:56:44.805 --> 01:56:56.933]  And don't forget also, this operation is funded by you buying the books, the t-shirts, the films, the materials available at infowars.com.
[01:56:56.933 --> 01:57:02.017]  Films like What in the World Are They Spraying on the Chemtrails, the Enemy of the State film we're now offering.
[01:57:02.737 --> 01:57:02.997]  That's right.
[01:57:26.260 --> 01:57:27.461]  You make it all possible.
[01:57:27.461 --> 01:57:30.383]  We couldn't do any of this without you.
[01:57:30.383 --> 01:57:34.286]  Continuing, food production systems.
[01:57:34.286 --> 01:57:37.148]  In fact, here's the video right here.
[01:57:37.148 --> 01:57:41.591]  The website is backyardfoodproduction.com.
[01:57:41.591 --> 01:57:43.992]  There's a banner up on infowars.com.
[01:57:46.374 --> 01:57:53.879]  Food production systems for a backyard or small farm DVD video with bonus resource CD.
[01:57:53.879 --> 01:57:58.062]  A lot of these have come across our desk to be sponsors and they haven't been that good.
[01:57:58.062 --> 01:57:58.822]  This is excellent.
[01:57:58.822 --> 01:57:59.423]  This is so good.
[01:57:59.423 --> 01:58:03.105]  We're going to be carrying it next month in our own online video bookstore shopping cart.
[01:58:03.105 --> 01:58:04.987]  But you need to go to their website.
[01:58:04.987 --> 01:58:06.227]  It's got everything.
[01:58:06.227 --> 01:58:08.829]  How to do it in the city or on a farm.
[01:58:08.829 --> 01:58:09.970]  All the tricks.

[01:58:55.123 --> 01:58:56.384]  Tyranny is here.
[01:58:56.384 --> 01:59:00.328]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:59:00.328 --> 01:59:02.570]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:59:02.570 --> 01:59:08.435]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:59:08.435 --> 01:59:14.681]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:59:15.081 --> 01:59:21.065]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:59:21.065 --> 01:59:25.247]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:59:25.247 --> 01:59:29.530]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:59:29.530 --> 01:59:35.473]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[01:59:35.473 --> 01:59:39.035]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:59:39.035 --> 01:59:41.017]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:59:41.017 --> 01:59:41.437]  It's here.

[01:59:56.236 --> 01:59:58.999]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.816 --> 02:00:07.117]  Big Brother.
[02:00:07.117 --> 02:00:08.878]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.878 --> 02:00:10.639]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.639 --> 02:00:12.221]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.221 --> 02:00:13.782]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.782 --> 02:00:17.965]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.965 --> 02:00:24.069]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.069 --> 02:00:30.453]  We had a caller call in earlier about a Vote Trot Again World Net Daily story, but it's ten years old.
[02:00:30.453 --> 02:00:30.854]  I hadn't
[02:00:31.738 --> 02:00:47.848]  I haven't read it yet, but we did look it up and it just shows how Bill Clinton was mailing out, for the Democratic candidate who was running against Bush, he was mailing out voter registration cards to illegal aliens.
[02:00:47.848 --> 02:00:52.191]  And that just shows how long all of this has been going on.
[02:00:53.863 --> 02:00:58.284]  Continuing here, Harry Reid, did he steal the Nevada election?
[02:00:58.284 --> 02:00:59.804]  We're going to be looking at that.
[02:00:59.804 --> 02:01:02.545]  Also the Federal Reserve announcement coming up.
[02:01:02.545 --> 02:01:05.185]  European stocks in lower ahead of Fed announcement.
[02:01:05.185 --> 02:01:06.726]  That's set in the next 15-20 minutes.
[02:01:06.726 --> 02:01:07.426]  We're watching that.
[02:01:07.426 --> 02:01:10.126]  We'll go to it live and cover it as soon as that unfolds.
[02:01:10.126 --> 02:01:12.607]  A lot of times they're late in their announcements.
[02:01:12.607 --> 02:01:16.608]  But I want to get through a bunch of your calls that have been holding right now.
[02:01:16.608 --> 02:01:20.008]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ray, or did I just talk to Ray in Texas?
[02:01:20.008 --> 02:01:21.569]  John, who's up first?
[02:01:21.569 --> 02:01:23.049]  Okay, Ray in Texas, you're up first.
[02:01:23.049 --> 02:01:23.369]  Go ahead.
[02:01:24.105 --> 02:01:33.094]  Oh, Alex, thank you for giving me the chance to briefly air an important local announcement that would otherwise fall through the cracks.
[02:01:33.094 --> 02:01:41.703]  At noon, well tomorrow, Dr. Paul Connett, Director of the Four Eyed Action Network, is going to arrive in Austin on a book tour.
[02:01:42.316 --> 02:01:50.983]  And he's going to begin by speaking for three minutes at noon before the Citizens Communication at the City Council.
[02:01:50.983 --> 02:01:55.166]  That could be very special.
[02:01:55.166 --> 02:02:05.494]  We've been wanting to get him on for a while and he said wait until his book came out because all the documentation and I'm going for a member but wasn't he one of the EPA top scientists that testified before Congress?
[02:02:06.357 --> 02:02:07.057]  That's a different person.
[02:02:07.057 --> 02:02:15.843]  That, in fact, was Hersey, who you didn't get back with after he was canceled when it was storming in Washington, D.C.
[02:02:15.843 --> 02:02:18.285]  Connette is a different person.
[02:02:18.285 --> 02:02:29.893]  There's so many of these scientists, I can't keep track of them all, but we'd like to get him in studio if he can hold over until Friday, because it sounds like he can't come on because he's going to be at the City Council.
[02:02:29.893 --> 02:02:33.535]  Can I give you a little more information real fast?
[02:02:33.535 --> 02:02:34.235]  After he does that,
[02:02:35.997 --> 02:02:42.140]  It's going to be followed by a string of events in the next few days including a big event at 7 p.m.
[02:02:42.140 --> 02:02:46.543]  tomorrow night at the UT Thompson Conference Center.
[02:02:46.543 --> 02:02:48.424]  He's going to talk, give a presentation.
[02:02:48.424 --> 02:02:56.068]  There will be a panel also and his entire schedule can be found in a big ad we took out on page 26.
[02:02:57.913 --> 02:03:08.368]  I think it's still the current Austin Chronicle, the one that has Perry as a werewolf on the cover, and another place you can find his entire Austin schedule is at
[02:03:09.341 --> 02:03:09.881]  W-W-W.
[02:03:09.881 --> 02:03:13.243]  And this is all one world story.
[02:03:13.243 --> 02:03:14.404]  The Chronicle is just worthless.
[02:03:14.404 --> 02:03:16.545]  You guys have done better advertising here.
[02:03:16.545 --> 02:03:23.168]  I don't care, but I've been a big supporter of the local Austin Fluoride group exposing all of that.
[02:03:23.168 --> 02:03:25.809]  But listen, I appreciate your call.
[02:03:25.809 --> 02:03:29.031]  Like I told you, we'd like to try to get him in studio.
[02:03:29.031 --> 02:03:30.792]  But thank you so much.
[02:03:30.792 --> 02:03:33.793]  Let's go ahead and talk to Morgan in New York.
[02:03:33.793 --> 02:03:34.594]  Morgan, you're on the air.
[02:03:35.746 --> 02:03:36.727]  Alex, how are you?
[02:03:36.727 --> 02:03:40.910]  First time caller and I'm so anxious to speak with you every time I've called in.
[02:03:40.910 --> 02:03:42.771]  I've never gotten through.
[02:03:42.771 --> 02:03:46.214]  God bless you and everybody there at InfoWars.
[02:03:46.214 --> 02:03:49.336]  Congratulations on the money bomb.
[02:03:49.336 --> 02:03:54.300]  Alex, you know, I just have a couple quick comments and then I'm going to get out of here because I know your time is very valuable.
[02:03:55.439 --> 02:04:02.428]  Uh, pretty much, uh, before I started listening to you, I came from a very, uh, you know, mainstream liberal family.
[02:04:02.428 --> 02:04:06.033]  Uh, you know, I was for illegal immigrants.
[02:04:06.033 --> 02:04:07.855]  I was against the Second Amendment.
[02:04:07.855 --> 02:04:11.460]  Uh, and you've totally opened up my eyes.
[02:04:11.460 --> 02:04:12.702]  I've always been a 9-11 truther.
[02:04:14.407 --> 02:04:27.251]  Since 2003, that's when I first found out about you at the five-year reunion there at Ground Zero when we marched in front of the Federal Reserve and let them know that we the people know what they're doing.
[02:04:27.251 --> 02:04:27.631]  That's right.
[02:04:27.631 --> 02:04:32.552]  We marched to the real government, not to their puppets, and we let them know we're coming after them politically.
[02:04:33.257 --> 02:04:33.817]  Yes, sir.
[02:04:33.817 --> 02:04:34.198]  Stay there.
[02:04:34.198 --> 02:04:44.426]  I'm going to have you finish up, Morgan, and then I'm going to go quickly to Mike, Ronnie, John, John, and others, that I've got to get into the election fraud, this big Federal Reserve announcement.
[02:04:44.426 --> 02:04:45.427]  It's all coming up.
[02:04:45.427 --> 02:04:50.931]  We're going to hurry through your calls on the other side, so stay there, Morgan.
[02:04:50.931 --> 02:04:57.436]  And each caller, have your point or question ready, because I want to try to get to everybody ahead of this other news, and we'll continue with calls after that.
[02:04:57.436 --> 02:04:58.737]  InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:05:02.813 --> 02:05:06.774]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:05:06.774 --> 02:05:15.635]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:05:15.635 --> 02:05:20.256]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:05:20.256 --> 02:05:31.078]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:05:31.698 --> 02:05:41.221]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:05:41.221 --> 02:05:46.642]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:05:46.642 --> 02:05:54.144]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:05:54.144 --> 02:05:56.545]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[02:06:02.051 --> 02:06:06.072]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:06:06.072 --> 02:06:09.313]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:06:09.313 --> 02:06:14.114]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:06:14.114 --> 02:06:20.496]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:06:20.496 --> 02:06:22.737]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:06:23.277 --> 02:06:23.597]  Tim Geithner?
[02:06:23.597 --> 02:06:24.098]  Bernanke?
[02:06:24.098 --> 02:06:24.898]  They're arsonists!
[02:06:24.898 --> 02:06:26.059]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:06:26.059 --> 02:06:28.300]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:06:42.188 --> 02:06:49.477]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the republic.
[02:06:49.477 --> 02:06:58.569]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:07:00.609 --> 02:07:05.152]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar-powered generator.
[02:07:05.152 --> 02:07:06.072]  Number one.
[02:07:06.072 --> 02:07:09.495]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:07:09.495 --> 02:07:10.355]  Number two.
[02:07:10.355 --> 02:07:15.258]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:07:15.258 --> 02:07:15.999]  It's true.
[02:07:15.999 --> 02:07:20.862]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:07:20.862 --> 02:07:21.702]  Number three.
[02:07:21.702 --> 02:07:25.285]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:07:25.285 --> 02:07:28.967]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:07:29.187 --> 02:07:29.988]  Number 4.
[02:07:29.988 --> 02:07:32.731]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:07:32.731 --> 02:07:36.415]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:07:36.415 --> 02:07:37.215]  Number 5.
[02:07:37.215 --> 02:07:41.360]  A solar-powered generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:07:41.360 --> 02:07:46.125]  Folks, I really believe in the solar-powered generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:07:46.405 --> 02:07:50.569]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:07:50.569 --> 02:07:52.371]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:07:52.371 --> 02:07:54.613]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:07:54.613 --> 02:07:56.956]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:08:05.799 --> 02:08:07.100]  Big Brother.
[02:08:07.100 --> 02:08:08.882]  Mainstream media.
[02:08:08.882 --> 02:08:10.644]  Government cover-ups.
[02:08:10.644 --> 02:08:12.225]  You want answers?
[02:08:12.225 --> 02:08:13.767]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:13.767 --> 02:08:17.971]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:17.971 --> 02:08:22.035]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:23.116 --> 02:08:27.900]  We're back live.
[02:08:27.900 --> 02:08:31.863]  We're supposedly 5-10 minutes away from the big Federal Reserve announcement.
[02:08:31.863 --> 02:08:40.170]  They've already telegraphed their intention to start monetizing 50 to 100 billion dollars a month.
[02:08:40.170 --> 02:08:43.033]  That is the Federal Reserve will buy U.S.
[02:08:43.033 --> 02:08:46.055]  Treasury bills basically with our tax money.
[02:08:46.055 --> 02:08:48.938]  We've got to pay it back and then they get all the value.
[02:08:50.785 --> 02:08:56.286]  And on top of it, it will accelerate the devaluation of the dollar and all the nightmares that that will cause.
[02:08:56.286 --> 02:08:58.747]  We're going to get into, did Harry Reid steal Nevada?
[02:08:58.747 --> 02:09:02.048]  We're doing the Google search term, steal Nevada, today.
[02:09:02.048 --> 02:09:05.408]  It should be the number one search term by the next hour.
[02:09:05.408 --> 02:09:07.969]  It at least takes about three hours for it to become the number one search term.
[02:09:07.969 --> 02:09:10.250]  I want to salute everybody that's taken action with this.
[02:09:10.250 --> 02:09:15.851]  Because, you know, I expose election fraud when Republicans cheat it, and I'm exposing it when Democrats cheat.
[02:09:16.611 --> 02:09:17.974]  And all the evidence is there.
[02:09:17.974 --> 02:09:20.859]  We're going to be going over that coming up.
[02:09:20.859 --> 02:09:23.304]  Morgan, finishing up your points real quick from New York.
[02:09:23.304 --> 02:09:23.625]  Go ahead.
[02:09:24.443 --> 02:09:37.256]  Oh yeah, so, you know, before I was, you know, knowing about 9-11 inside job, you know, I was very anti-America and anti this empire, but you've ignited the patriotism in me as an American, and I really appreciate that.
[02:09:37.256 --> 02:09:47.967]  Yeah, we were taken over from within and used to empower the empire and to pay for it, but we ourselves are not the bad guys, except for not being informed and involved, and so the globalist
[02:09:48.467 --> 02:09:55.491]  Create the empire, take over the world in our name, then demonize America and bring us down in the final phase.
[02:09:55.491 --> 02:09:56.411]  Yeah, for sure.
[02:09:56.411 --> 02:10:01.734]  And basically, I mean, I got into you through YouTube, you know, watching the videos.
[02:10:01.734 --> 02:10:04.075]  And then I started listening to your free stream.
[02:10:04.075 --> 02:10:09.938]  And then I became a Prison Planet TV member because I was tired about hearing all these documents and these commercials and not being able to see it.
[02:10:09.938 --> 02:10:13.019]  So I signed up for the year membership.
[02:10:13.019 --> 02:10:15.921]  And before I was listening to you regularly,
[02:10:16.597 --> 02:10:28.104]  Uh, you know, my father-in-law, it was Christmas last year, he comes in with the H1N1 shot, you know, he just gave it to me, I was like, whatever, and then after listening to your show, I was like, oh my god, I can't believe I let him do that to me.
[02:10:28.530 --> 02:10:31.934]  Well, now we're vindicated again, and I appreciate your call, Morgan.
[02:10:31.934 --> 02:10:48.631]  It's confirmed that the H1N1 doubles your chances of getting the regular flu, lowers your immune system across the board, is filled with dangerous adjuvants we've had medical doctors on, including the head of the EU program, Dr. Wolfgang Wudarg, and the head editor of the British Medical Journal.
[02:10:49.730 --> 02:11:01.575]  Almost a year after we exposed it, now mainstream news that it was deadly and caused seizures, brain damage, narcolepsy, Guillain-Barré, the list goes on and on.
[02:11:01.575 --> 02:11:04.156]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mike in Wyoming.
[02:11:04.156 --> 02:11:05.857]  Mike, you're on the air.
[02:11:05.857 --> 02:11:07.557]  Yes, hi Alex.
[02:11:07.557 --> 02:11:14.000]  I wanted to recommend to you and to your listeners a book that really was kind of the last piece of the puzzle for me.
[02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:15.921]  It's entitled, They Own It All.
[02:11:16.844 --> 02:11:32.638]  uh... subtitled by means of toxic currency and by ronald mcdonald by ronald mcdonald and bob rowan uh... position uh... basically explains uh... how the the nineteen thirty three bankruptcy uh... and switch uh...
[02:11:34.084 --> 02:11:40.530]  You know, I haven't read that book, but I've scanned over it.
[02:11:40.530 --> 02:11:41.511]  I was given it a few weeks ago.
[02:11:41.511 --> 02:11:43.293]  I've heard about it off and on the last year.
[02:11:43.293 --> 02:11:45.215]  We're going to get Ronald McDonald on the show.
[02:11:45.215 --> 02:11:45.595]  That's it.
[02:11:45.595 --> 02:11:47.337]  We'll just get Ronald on.
[02:11:47.337 --> 02:11:48.578]  Yeah, excellent idea.
[02:11:48.578 --> 02:11:50.900]  But it's a great book.
[02:11:50.900 --> 02:11:52.662]  It's a really easy read.
[02:11:52.662 --> 02:11:56.746]  You don't have to be an attorney or have a vast fund of legal knowledge to understand it.
[02:11:57.358 --> 02:12:15.645]  Basically it shows how being stuck with this foreign commercial paper, which is what Federal Reserve notes are, since the Fed is a foreign corporation, implicates us in international commerce and allows them to treat us as though we are merchants engaging in international commerce.
[02:12:16.511 --> 02:12:20.892]  And subject us to these alphabet soup regulating agencies.
[02:12:20.892 --> 02:12:26.834]  This is a corporate system that is designed to create a black hole of debt that is impossible to pay back.
[02:12:26.834 --> 02:12:28.314]  They create the debt out of nothing.
[02:12:28.314 --> 02:12:30.174]  They get the whole world for nothing.
[02:12:30.174 --> 02:12:36.356]  As Thomas Jefferson said, if we ever let private banks control the issuance of currency and credit,
[02:12:37.496 --> 02:12:49.600]  Our progeny will wake up homeless on the continent their forefathers conquered and we are going in to bondage and it's all fraudulent and we've got a race to educate people that it's a fraud.
[02:12:49.600 --> 02:12:51.901]  That's why Ron Paul and Rand Paul are so important.
[02:12:51.901 --> 02:12:56.042]  That's why the system hates them so much so that people know what caused this.
[02:12:56.042 --> 02:13:04.905]  But what do you think, Mike, of the CNBC, MSNBC talking point now that the depression is about to be caused by Rand Paul?
[02:13:06.240 --> 02:13:12.867]  Well, I mean, you know, their desperation is written all over them with moves like that.
[02:13:12.867 --> 02:13:18.653]  I mean, you don't have to be a metal giant to see through something as transparent as that.
[02:13:18.653 --> 02:13:23.358]  A man who isn't even in office, they're trying to stick him with the blame.
[02:13:23.358 --> 02:13:25.079]  You know, that's going to backfire big time.
[02:13:25.079 --> 02:13:28.403]  It just makes them look like idiots as well as hypocrites.
[02:13:29.192 --> 02:13:33.835]  Well, it shows their disdain and contempt for their listeners.
[02:13:33.835 --> 02:13:57.112]  Do you agree with me that overall, even if a lot of these people are neocons posing as patriots, the fact that they now have to capitulate and admit world government, admit dollar devaluation is bad, Republicans have to at least say they're against open borders, the fact that they're having to take on everything we've always talked about shows how mainstream this awakening has become.
[02:13:58.246 --> 02:13:59.006]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:13:59.006 --> 02:14:14.735]  They're having to divulge more and more about Freemasonry, about Skull and Bones, about all these secret societies that have such a pivotal role in advancing the world government, because they know we're catching on to it.
[02:14:14.735 --> 02:14:20.478]  So they have to keep our interest by giving us a little red meat.
[02:14:20.478 --> 02:14:24.820]  And eventually, the people are going to catch on to the fact that, hey,
[02:14:25.447 --> 02:14:32.312]  Those guys out there that they've been painting as loonies for so long, they've actually been, you know, right on target.
[02:14:32.312 --> 02:14:39.156]  And, you know, it's the MSNBCs and the History Channels that have been feeding us nonsense for years.
[02:14:39.156 --> 02:14:49.764]  Well, I'm going to get Kurt Nemo to write an article today, or Steve or Aaron, one of the writers, about how important it is to get Ron Paul to run for Speaker of the House.
[02:14:50.644 --> 02:14:52.004]  He's been there as long as Boehner.
[02:14:52.004 --> 02:14:54.165]  He's got a better record than Boehner.
[02:14:54.165 --> 02:15:04.667]  And positioning him for a run for the presidency, we need to push for Ron Paul to be the House leader, to be the Speaker, not Boehner.
[02:15:04.667 --> 02:15:05.247]  Absolutely.
[02:15:05.247 --> 02:15:07.707]  Boehner is a loon.
[02:15:07.707 --> 02:15:12.448]  This is the man who cries at the drop of a hat.
[02:15:12.448 --> 02:15:15.229]  He's the consummate actor and liar.
[02:15:17.628 --> 02:15:24.030]  Well, it's important, and we've got another article, several.
[02:15:24.030 --> 02:15:26.971]  Rand Paul promises to challenge GOP establishment.
[02:15:26.971 --> 02:15:29.291]  PrisonPlanet.com, another key article.
[02:15:29.291 --> 02:15:33.232]  Ron Paul can beat Obama in 2012.
[02:15:33.232 --> 02:15:39.994]  That is so important, people, to read this and see the points we've made, and to get it out to everyone they know.
[02:15:39.994 --> 02:15:41.935]  I really do appreciate your call.
[02:15:41.935 --> 02:15:42.615]  Mike, anything else?
[02:15:44.701 --> 02:15:46.943]  All right, Mike's gone.
[02:15:46.943 --> 02:15:52.107]  The Federal Reserve is set to make this announcement right now, but they're not making it, and that's normal.
[02:15:52.107 --> 02:15:56.851]  They usually make the decision behind closed doors.
[02:15:56.851 --> 02:15:59.213]  Yeah, it's not yet.
[02:15:59.213 --> 02:16:10.402]  So the Dow Jones is plunging right now ahead of the expectation that the Federal Reserve is going to announce quantitative easing, QE2, an acceleration of monetizing debt.
[02:16:10.402 --> 02:16:13.364]  They've been putting their toe in the water in the last two years buying
[02:16:14.285 --> 02:16:16.266]  Hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars of U.S.
[02:16:16.266 --> 02:16:33.017]  Treasury notes, but now they're saying, according to the reports we've read, and there are Federal Reserve heads in different regional banks who are criticizing it, but they're not voting members, saying this is going to kill the dollar and kill the economy, but it doesn't matter.
[02:16:33.017 --> 02:16:34.598]  The media is saying the Tea Party is going to do it.
[02:16:35.609 --> 02:16:37.990]  The media says the stock market in the U.S.
[02:16:37.990 --> 02:16:48.837]  is plunging because of the Tea Party having victory, but when you actually read the financial publications, it's because of the Federal Reserve and the uncertainty about what's going to happen.
[02:16:48.837 --> 02:16:55.381]  But the fact that many of them do believe that they're about to announce the acceleration of quantitative easing, i.e., monetizing debt.
[02:16:56.261 --> 02:16:57.742]  Devaluing the dollar.
[02:16:57.742 --> 02:16:58.622]  Here's Wall Street Journal.
[02:16:58.622 --> 02:17:00.703]  European stocks in lower ahead of Fed announcement.
[02:17:00.703 --> 02:17:06.365]  European stock markets ended on weaker note today as uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the latest meeting of the U.S.
[02:17:06.365 --> 02:17:10.406]  Federal Reserve overshadowed confidence about corporate earnings in the region.
[02:17:10.406 --> 02:17:15.728]  The Federal Open Market Committee is scheduled to announce its latest policy move after European markets closed.
[02:17:15.728 --> 02:17:18.349]  Investors remained uncertain how the Fed's policy would affect U.S.
[02:17:18.349 --> 02:17:20.350]  economic growth and financial markets.
[02:17:20.350 --> 02:17:24.912]  Markets largely took the expected Republican surge in the midterm elections in stride, choosing instead
[02:17:25.852 --> 02:17:27.833]  Here it is, let's go to the announcement.
[02:17:27.833 --> 02:17:32.334]  Progress towards its policy objectives have been, quote, disappointingly slow.
[02:17:32.334 --> 02:17:44.516]  And it was taking this new step to promote a, quote, stronger pace of economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation over time is at levels consistent with its mandate.
[02:17:44.516 --> 02:17:52.038]  It also said that it will continue to reinvest proceeds from its maturing holdings of securities into new treasury securities.
[02:17:52.458 --> 02:17:59.201]  Longer-term treasuries at a rate of 250 billion to 300 billion over the same period.
[02:17:59.201 --> 02:18:11.948]  So the Fed total purchases here will be up to 900 billion dollars over the next eight months to help try to push interest rates even lower for mortgages, car loans, and business loans.
[02:18:12.408 --> 02:18:28.579]  The Fed said that the currently unemployment rate is elevated and measures of underlying inflation are somewhat low relative to levels that the committee judges to be consistent over the longer term, over the longer run with its dual mandate.
[02:18:28.579 --> 02:18:39.367]  Although the committee anticipates a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in the context of price stability, it again said that progress towards its objectives have been disappointingly slow.
[02:18:39.867 --> 02:18:40.888]  We're good to go.
[02:18:59.446 --> 02:19:11.752]  On its economic analysis, the FOMC said that information received since it met in September confirms that the pace of recovery in employment continues to be slow.
[02:19:11.752 --> 02:19:20.016]  Household spending is increasing gradually, but remains constrained by high unemployment, modest income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit.
[02:19:20.396 --> 02:19:29.838]  Business spending on equipment and software is rising, though less rapidly than earlier in the year, while investment in non-residential structures continues to be weak.
[02:19:29.838 --> 02:19:33.239]  Employers remain reluctant to add to payrolls.
[02:19:33.239 --> 02:19:35.339]  Housing starts continue to be depressed.
[02:19:35.339 --> 02:19:43.961]  Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable, but measures of underlying inflation have trended lower in recent quarters.
[02:19:44.441 --> 02:19:52.625]  The vote for this policy action today, 10 to 1, that with the one dissenter once again, Thomas Hoenig of the Kansas City Fed.
[02:19:52.625 --> 02:19:53.186]  Back to you.
[02:19:53.186 --> 02:19:54.466]  Peter Barnes, thank you very much.
[02:19:54.466 --> 02:19:56.207]  There you go, everybody.
[02:19:56.207 --> 02:19:58.508]  $600 billion more dollars being put into the U.S.
[02:19:58.508 --> 02:20:01.770]  financial system, courtesy of the Federal Reserve.
[02:20:01.770 --> 02:20:04.051]  $75 billion a month, up to eight months.
[02:20:04.051 --> 02:20:10.154]  That brings the total amount of Fed money that has been announced since the Lehman Brothers crisis to more than $2.3 trillion.
[02:20:10.154 --> 02:20:10.655]  Jeff Given.
[02:20:13.616 --> 02:20:15.538]  You are the bond guy on the panel.
[02:20:15.538 --> 02:20:29.389]  So, $75 billion, so it's going to be between $50 and $100 billion and they can change that, but $75 billion a month over the next eight months and they give that directly to themselves.
[02:20:29.389 --> 02:20:32.291]  The banks will even clamp down more on lending.
[02:20:32.291 --> 02:20:35.794]  That spigot only goes to them.
[02:20:36.674 --> 02:20:44.356]  And so they get the money up front before it loses all the value, and they pass it on to you when it's devalued, and then you've got to pay them back in taxes.
[02:20:44.356 --> 02:20:46.356]  And the stock market began shooting back up.
[02:20:46.356 --> 02:20:49.617]  It's like, oh, our kings haven't announced what they're going to do.
[02:20:49.617 --> 02:20:53.117]  Just showing how it's all a big casino in the sky, totally staged.
[02:20:53.117 --> 02:20:56.098]  It was plunging, plunging, plunging down.
[02:20:56.098 --> 02:21:01.979]  And then, oh, they came out and made the announcement that they were going to pump all this money in.
[02:21:01.979 --> 02:21:05.800]  And these big private central banks that are getting all this money, they go in and buy stocks.
[02:21:07.025 --> 02:21:08.647]  That's one of the big things they buy.
[02:21:08.647 --> 02:21:13.791]  So, oh, we're going to have, uh, you know, 600 or more on top of all the other money.
[02:21:13.791 --> 02:21:18.316]  It's over 900 billion total in the next eight months, pumped in a lot of it into stocks.
[02:21:18.316 --> 02:21:23.701]  You know, you're not going to be giving it in car loans or housing loans or business loans.
[02:21:23.701 --> 02:21:23.801]  No.
[02:21:25.225 --> 02:21:29.609]  And there is the chart right there.
[02:21:29.609 --> 02:21:31.911]  Blow that chart up.
[02:21:31.911 --> 02:21:33.753]  What period is that over?
[02:21:33.753 --> 02:21:37.777]  But you can see today how it was plunging.
[02:21:37.777 --> 02:21:38.938]  It shows how rigged it is.
[02:21:38.938 --> 02:21:48.066]  And then it just automatically just zooms, zooms back up with the stock market up 21 points.
[02:21:48.066 --> 02:21:49.828]  Well, that's the Dow Jones Industrial right there.
[02:21:51.741 --> 02:21:56.879]  So unbelievable, showing you how rigged these markets are.
[02:21:56.879 --> 02:21:58.043]  And imagine the insiders.
[02:21:59.790 --> 02:22:11.557]  Who started having their robocomputers dump stock right ahead of that to make others panic and start selling, and all the computer systems and smaller firms that are set to start selling when it plunges.
[02:22:11.557 --> 02:22:19.181]  And then they knew that minutes later, the Fed would come out and announce what insiders wanted, and so it shoots right back up.
[02:22:19.181 --> 02:22:25.545]  I mean, you just, that's like a few months ago with that thousand point drop in 10 minutes, and then it shoots right back up 900 points.
[02:22:25.545 --> 02:22:27.426]  I mean, you talk about corruption.
[02:22:27.426 --> 02:22:28.627]  We are seeing so much.
[02:22:29.247 --> 02:22:29.568]  I think?
[02:22:48.529 --> 02:22:49.410]  from now.
[02:22:49.410 --> 02:23:01.399]  I want to get into election fraud that is taking place as well, and all of your phone calls, people that are patiently holding right now, but...
[02:23:02.426 --> 02:23:25.997]  That's the signal, and I would expect for this, who knows what they'll do in their manipulations the next few days, but I would expect for this to drive the dollar down big time, and only intensify the global move by the Japanese, the Chinese, the European Union, the Russians, the Arabs, the Middle Easterners, the Latin Americans, everybody, away from the dollar.
[02:23:25.997 --> 02:23:31.440]  Because this is just like in Mexico, you go back over the last 50 years, every decade or so, they make the announcement,
[02:23:32.320 --> 02:23:40.505]  Uh, that they are going to, uh, devalue their currency, and, uh, people start dumping the currency.
[02:23:40.505 --> 02:23:44.167]  Uh, so now we're gonna pay our bills with just made-up money.
[02:23:44.167 --> 02:23:49.129]  It's only a fraction of it backed up by tax money, and, and don't worry, they're gonna squeeze that out of you.
[02:23:49.129 --> 02:23:51.010]  They're gonna squeeze that out of me.
[02:23:51.010 --> 02:23:59.535]  And the worse the economy gets, the more they'll accelerate the debt, and then if somebody like Rand Paul or Ron Paul comes out and says, hey, we need to stop this, you're the one that caused the Depression!
[02:24:00.469 --> 02:24:03.011]  Well, wait, I'm not even in office yet.
[02:24:03.011 --> 02:24:05.832]  So, there you have it, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:24:05.832 --> 02:24:12.317]  I'm gonna go ahead and just read this press release right now, then we'll get into your phone calls and election fraud in the next segment.
[02:24:12.317 --> 02:24:15.779]  This released by the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.
[02:24:15.779 --> 02:24:19.881]  They had a 10 to 1 vote on this.
[02:24:19.881 --> 02:24:23.624]  The Kansas City Fed head said no to it.
[02:24:23.624 --> 02:24:26.966]  Information received since the federal open market, and most of this is lies.
[02:24:26.966 --> 02:24:28.247]  They say inflation is low.
[02:24:29.582 --> 02:24:43.986]  We've already got incredible food going up, gas going up, gold going up, silver going up, all of this stuff going up, and there is some depressionary trends and deflationary trends in housing, but that's only in one bubble sector.
[02:24:43.986 --> 02:24:46.826]  Overall, they're trying to balance all this out and consolidate wealth.
[02:24:46.826 --> 02:24:48.467]  It's not working, but I'm sorry, I digress.
[02:24:48.467 --> 02:24:55.509]  For immediate release, information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in September confirms the pace of recovery in output.
[02:24:55.509 --> 02:24:56.329]  Oh, there's a recovery!
[02:24:57.209 --> 02:24:59.530]  And they tell you that unemployment is less than 10% too.
[02:24:59.530 --> 02:25:01.030]  They just lie.
[02:25:01.030 --> 02:25:04.291]  The pace of recovery and output and employment continues to be slow.
[02:25:04.291 --> 02:25:14.034]  Household spending is increasing gradually, but remains constrained by high unemployment, modest income growth, incomes down, lower housing wealth, and tight credit.
[02:25:14.034 --> 02:25:16.595]  Because you got all the money banks, but you won't give it out.
[02:25:17.415 --> 02:25:22.559]  Business spending on equipment and software is rising, though less rapidly than earlier in the year.
[02:25:22.559 --> 02:25:25.801]  Well, that's because they gave you a bigger tax credit on being able to buy equipment.
[02:25:25.801 --> 02:25:27.182]  You can write that off.
[02:25:27.182 --> 02:25:35.729]  Business spending on equipment and software is rising, though less rapidly than earlier in the year, while investment in non-residential structures continues to be weak.
[02:25:36.937 --> 02:25:38.840]  Well, it's weak and residential as well.
[02:25:38.840 --> 02:25:42.164]  Employers remain reluctant to add to payrolls.
[02:25:42.164 --> 02:25:43.506]  One grain of truth.
[02:25:43.506 --> 02:25:45.188]  Housing starts continue to be depressed.
[02:25:45.188 --> 02:25:46.671]  That's true.
[02:25:46.671 --> 02:25:49.535]  Longer term inflation expectations have remained stable.
[02:25:50.592 --> 02:25:51.613]  That's a lie.
[02:25:51.613 --> 02:25:54.795]  But measures of underlying inflation have tended lower in recent quarters.
[02:25:54.795 --> 02:25:56.136]  Not true.
[02:25:56.136 --> 02:26:04.722]  Consistent with the stationary statutory mandate, the committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.
[02:26:04.722 --> 02:26:10.486]  Currently, the unemployment rate is elevated and measures of underlying inflation are somewhat low.
[02:26:10.486 --> 02:26:17.391]  Relative to levels that the committee judges to be consistent over the long run with its dual mandate.
[02:26:17.891 --> 02:26:25.438]  Although the committee anticipates a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability.
[02:26:25.438 --> 02:26:26.839]  Oh, we got real price stability, folks.
[02:26:26.839 --> 02:26:27.680]  No, we don't.
[02:26:27.680 --> 02:26:32.464]  Progress towards its objectives have been disappointingly slow.
[02:26:32.464 --> 02:26:41.572]  To promote a stronger pace of recovery, you gotta love this doublespeak, to promote a stronger pace of recovery, economic recovery, and to help, now this is the big issue right here,
[02:26:42.273 --> 02:26:55.647]  To promote a stronger pace of recovery and to help ensure that inflation over time is at levels consistent with its mandate, the Committee decided today to expand its holdings of securities, i.e.
[02:26:55.647 --> 02:26:55.888]  U.S.
[02:26:55.888 --> 02:26:57.029]  Treasuries.
[02:26:57.029 --> 02:27:04.177]  The Committee will maintain its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its security holdings.
[02:27:05.708 --> 02:27:08.071]  But they're not keeping their same policy.
[02:27:08.071 --> 02:27:09.553]  They're expanding it.
[02:27:09.553 --> 02:27:10.775]  Yeah, they've had quantitative easing.
[02:27:10.775 --> 02:27:12.077]  Now they're expanding it.
[02:27:12.077 --> 02:27:21.409]  In addition, the committee intends to purchase a further $600 billion of long-term Treasury securities by the end of the second quarter of 2011.
[02:27:23.541 --> 02:27:24.401]  That's the next eight months.
[02:27:44.272 --> 02:27:49.675]  And we'll adjust the program as needed to best foster maximum employment and price stability.
[02:27:49.675 --> 02:27:52.877]  Oh yeah, monetizing the debt will only make prices go up.
[02:27:52.877 --> 02:27:54.497]  That isn't price stability.
[02:27:54.497 --> 02:28:02.301]  The committee will maintain a target range for the federal funds rate of 0 to 1.4% and continues to anticipate the economic conditions.
[02:28:02.301 --> 02:28:05.923]  So having low interest rates will further devalue the dollar on top of monetization.
[02:28:05.923 --> 02:28:06.884]  That's a double whammy.
[02:28:08.399 --> 02:28:21.989]  Including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, another lie, are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate for an expanded period.
[02:28:21.989 --> 02:28:24.050]  So they're telling you you're going to get low interest rates.
[02:28:24.050 --> 02:28:25.351]  Not if you're not a mega bank.
[02:28:25.351 --> 02:28:29.334]  Yeah, they get it for zero or, you know, 0.1%.
[02:28:29.334 --> 02:28:31.135]  Your credit, many credit cards have gone above 30%.
[02:28:32.864 --> 02:28:34.545]  Rates are going up everywhere.
[02:28:34.545 --> 02:28:37.126]  Even if you got incredibly good credit, rates are going up.
[02:28:37.126 --> 02:28:48.031]  So, all of this money and all of these interest rates being low, that only affects the ultra-rich and the insiders.
[02:28:48.031 --> 02:28:48.271]  Ah!
[02:28:48.271 --> 02:28:50.932]  I mean, it's just amazing to watch them do this.
[02:28:50.932 --> 02:28:54.594]  And right now, the stock market went way down 20 minutes ago.
[02:28:54.594 --> 02:28:56.294]  It shot back up 10 minutes ago.
[02:28:56.294 --> 02:28:58.155]  Now it's going back down.
[02:28:58.155 --> 02:29:00.016]  I mean, it's just total rollercoaster.
[02:29:02.110 --> 02:29:13.200]  The committee will continue to monitor the economic outlook and financial developments and will employ its policy tools necessary to support the economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation over time is at levels consistent with its mandate.
[02:29:13.200 --> 02:29:28.974]  Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were Ben Espernacki, Chairman, William C. Dudley, Vice Chairman, James Bullard, Elizabeth A. Drake, Sandra Penalato, Sarah Bloom, Raskin, Eric S.
[02:29:30.327 --> 02:29:34.188]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:34.188 --> 02:29:36.689]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.175 --> 02:30:05.378]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[02:30:05.378 --> 02:30:11.783]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[02:30:11.783 --> 02:30:19.169]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[02:30:19.169 --> 02:30:24.052]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[02:31:52.697 --> 02:31:54.558]  It's HomeGain.com.

[02:32:00.962 --> 02:32:04.546]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[02:32:04.546 --> 02:32:05.667]  It ended on June of 2009.
[02:32:05.667 --> 02:32:10.232]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[02:32:10.232 --> 02:32:16.178]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[02:32:16.178 --> 02:32:18.340]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[02:32:18.340 --> 02:32:21.023]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[02:32:21.343 --> 02:32:27.848]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[02:32:27.848 --> 02:32:30.070]  They both make fabulous investments.
[02:32:30.070 --> 02:32:35.414]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[02:32:35.414 --> 02:32:40.358]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[02:32:40.678 --> 02:32:46.042]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious easy fix meals to enjoy now or save for long term.
[02:32:46.042 --> 02:32:49.245]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[02:32:49.245 --> 02:32:52.247]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[02:32:52.247 --> 02:32:53.008]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[02:33:12.038 --> 02:33:32.670]  So, the magnitude of this is even hard to express verbally, but the Federal Reserve has monetized hundreds of billions of dollars of made-up debt.
[02:33:32.670 --> 02:33:39.614]  They are now giving themselves $600 billion, at least, they say it may be more, in the next eight months.
[02:33:41.377 --> 02:33:50.146]  Remember, $887 billion turned into $28 trillion, that's Bloomberg, with the banker takeover known as the bailout two years ago.
[02:33:50.146 --> 02:33:56.733]  And now they're saying $600 billion or more, but they won't tell Congress where the money goes.
[02:33:59.151 --> 02:34:02.653]  I mean, these people are just incredible swindlers.
[02:34:02.653 --> 02:34:06.516]  So it's not just the Chinese communists that have our debt.
[02:34:06.516 --> 02:34:08.737]  Soon the Federal Reserve will be the biggest donor.
[02:34:08.737 --> 02:34:15.562]  Because the Chinese and the Europeans and the Russians and the Japanese and the Arabs, they're done because our government's devaluing.
[02:34:15.562 --> 02:34:17.563]  And the Chinese are saying, stop it!
[02:34:17.563 --> 02:34:18.023]  Stop it!
[02:34:18.023 --> 02:34:19.224]  We've bought all your debt!
[02:34:19.224 --> 02:34:20.405]  Don't devalue your dollar!
[02:34:21.556 --> 02:34:23.596]  And the Fed says, we run this country.
[02:34:23.596 --> 02:34:28.957]  Our public is starting to wake up, but we put a police state in place, a surveillance system.
[02:34:28.957 --> 02:34:35.339]  We're gonna be able to control this, and we got nuclear weapons, so shut up, nobody's gonna stop us.
[02:34:35.339 --> 02:34:39.640]  Now, I wanna get into election fraud, but first I'm gonna rampage through five, six callers.
[02:34:39.640 --> 02:34:43.480]  I'm gonna give each person about a minute, no matter how good the call is, because I gotta get to the next person.
[02:34:43.480 --> 02:34:45.781]  But I do wanna briefly tell you about Interfood.
[02:34:45.781 --> 02:34:48.881]  You heard Mike Adams, the preeminent expert on Whole Foods.
[02:34:48.881 --> 02:34:50.742]  This is 20 superfoods,
[02:34:51.542 --> 02:34:57.584]  Two little scoops in the morning in your juice or your water and you get almost 100% absorption.
[02:34:57.584 --> 02:35:03.826]  Find out about the 20 key botanical superfoods that are in each scoop at innerfood.com or 866-762-9238 and tell them about
[02:35:09.247 --> 02:35:15.189]  Ask them about discounts for Alex Jones listeners like the Alex Jones combo on the coconut, organic coconut milk.
[02:35:15.189 --> 02:35:19.030]  They've got healthy infused with minerals and nutrients coffee.
[02:35:19.030 --> 02:35:20.930]  They've got a great line of products at interfood.com or 866-762-9238.
[02:35:20.930 --> 02:35:22.331]  And finally, ladies and gentlemen...
[02:35:26.872 --> 02:35:29.635]  I want to tell you about PureWaterFreedom.com.
[02:35:29.635 --> 02:35:31.997]  One word, PureWaterFreedom.com.
[02:35:31.997 --> 02:35:36.381]  If you want to affordably remove fluoride from your tap water, visit PureWaterFreedom.com.
[02:35:36.381 --> 02:35:38.603]  They have a full line of household fluoride filters.
[02:35:38.603 --> 02:35:42.787]  You can even remove fluoride from every water source in your home with a whole house fluoride system.
[02:35:42.787 --> 02:35:47.411]  They have a wide variety of filters to remove all types of toxins from your water, including shower, bath, and filters.
[02:35:48.132 --> 02:35:50.253]  All the filters are made in the USA.
[02:35:50.253 --> 02:35:51.093]  USA.
[02:35:51.093 --> 02:35:53.054]  Did I tell you they're made in the USA?
[02:35:53.054 --> 02:35:54.714]  We look for sponsors that are made in the USA.
[02:35:54.714 --> 02:35:56.075]  It's hard, but we find them.
[02:35:56.075 --> 02:36:02.277]  Check out their banners on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com or go to PureWaterFreedom.com to take control of your water supply today.
[02:36:02.277 --> 02:36:08.339]  If you have children and you're not filtering your water with the proper filters, you are crazy, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:36:08.339 --> 02:36:09.840]  I mean, it is nuts.
[02:36:09.840 --> 02:36:14.341]  The tap water is so full of garbage, it will make anybody's head spin.
[02:36:14.341 --> 02:36:15.942]  Okay, I want to get into election fraud.
[02:36:16.642 --> 02:36:22.485]  In the time we've got left, about 25 minutes here, but let's hurry now to your phone calls.
[02:36:22.485 --> 02:36:24.986]  I'm going to go to John in Texas first.
[02:36:24.986 --> 02:36:25.946]  John, you're on the air.
[02:36:25.946 --> 02:36:27.087]  Welcome.
[02:36:27.087 --> 02:36:27.967]  Hey, Alex.
[02:36:27.967 --> 02:36:33.109]  Real quick, Dr. Horowitz, are you going to have him on again anytime soon?
[02:36:33.109 --> 02:36:35.610]  No, and I appreciate your call.
[02:36:35.610 --> 02:36:37.391]  Thank you so much for the call, John.
[02:36:37.391 --> 02:36:40.933]  Let's go ahead and talk to John in Ohio.
[02:36:40.933 --> 02:36:41.893]  John, you're on the air.
[02:36:41.893 --> 02:36:42.313]  Go ahead.
[02:36:42.313 --> 02:36:45.635]  Yeah, Alex, you know that I've been attacking
[02:36:46.423 --> 02:36:55.290]  Exposing Obama as a disguised neocon, even before he was nominated, even before he was inaugurated.
[02:36:55.290 --> 02:36:58.473]  So I can't be accused of being a pro-democrat.
[02:36:58.473 --> 02:37:04.738]  But I believe that, and you can find much of this information on globalresearch.ca.
[02:37:04.738 --> 02:37:13.785]  And I really applaud your valuable populism in exposing the false flag terrorism around the world, the phony terror war,
[02:37:14.298 --> 02:37:42.818]  But on the other hand, I think it's reached the tipping point now, where you're supporting actual neocons, and the Tea Party movement, warmongers, those in the military-industrial complex, and to some extent, demonizing China, as you just pointed out, which has been financing our wars for all these years, has been propping up, taking our funny money, our rubber money, for their durable goods, and finally is realizing that our noose is tightening around them,
[02:37:43.534 --> 02:37:44.214]  I don't think so.
[02:38:05.020 --> 02:38:08.622]  And that's another hoax and another lie, okay?
[02:38:08.622 --> 02:38:13.005]  I decried it and said it was wrong and was an escalation, okay?
[02:38:13.005 --> 02:38:18.909]  And I've heard your calls 10, 15 times in the last year about Rand Paul being a warmonger.
[02:38:18.909 --> 02:38:22.251]  Rand Paul was attacked by Dick Cheney, Karl Rove, and others.
[02:38:22.251 --> 02:38:28.355]  They came and campaigned and pumped money into the guy against him, and they went against him.
[02:38:28.355 --> 02:38:31.177]  He has said, oh, I support defense,
[02:38:32.438 --> 02:38:34.939]  But I want to cut defense spending.
[02:38:34.939 --> 02:38:37.280]  And I don't want to start all these wars.
[02:38:37.280 --> 02:38:37.901]  Okay?
[02:38:37.901 --> 02:38:42.423]  Rand Paul wants to get rid of the Federal Reserve that runs the whole show.
[02:38:42.423 --> 02:38:43.183]  Okay?
[02:38:43.183 --> 02:38:45.124]  And so I've heard it from you.
[02:38:45.124 --> 02:38:47.666]  I might as well just go back and find a tape of it and play it again.
[02:38:48.326 --> 02:38:52.288]  I've heard it from you over and over, okay?
[02:38:52.288 --> 02:39:02.873]  And it's intellectually dishonest by people that are jealous and other talk show hosting people who don't like the fact that we're reaching millions of people to lie about what I say and what I stand for.
[02:39:03.823 --> 02:39:08.265]  And people who say that I said, if you're a critic of Israel, you're mentally ill.
[02:39:08.265 --> 02:39:24.172]  I said that if you say I work for Israel, or that I am financed by Israel, when it's a complete lie, the big Israeli financed ADL attacks me, Southern Poverty Law Center, all of it, I'm against these wars, I was against what happened in Lebanon, I'm against what happened in Gaza, and it can't be clear!
[02:39:24.992 --> 02:39:32.315]  But it's this religion of people saying, I'm right, I'm the biggest Israel hater in the world, and Alex is bad.
[02:39:32.315 --> 02:39:33.936]  Well, good then!
[02:39:33.936 --> 02:39:34.796]  Okay?
[02:39:34.796 --> 02:39:35.556]  Good.
[02:39:35.556 --> 02:39:37.357]  Sit there and lie about me all day.
[02:39:37.357 --> 02:39:38.778]  Make up whatever you want.
[02:39:38.778 --> 02:39:42.279]  What I cover and what I say is on record, and people know that.
[02:39:42.279 --> 02:39:42.559]  Okay?
[02:39:42.559 --> 02:39:44.560]  So that's the last straw with you, John.
[02:39:44.560 --> 02:39:45.961]  I'm not going to sit here and hear this.
[02:39:45.961 --> 02:39:48.542]  I'm saying we need Ron Paul in there for speaker.
[02:39:48.542 --> 02:39:51.523]  I'm saying we need to not get Rick Perry in there.
[02:39:51.903 --> 02:39:54.104]  I'm exposing the real neocons.
[02:39:54.104 --> 02:40:00.546]  The fact is, the Tea Party's having to talk about world government and the New World Order and the Federal Reserve.
[02:40:00.546 --> 02:40:03.708]  We've now pushed it to the point where it's becoming mainstream.
[02:40:03.708 --> 02:40:12.671]  And we've got this loser mentality that we could never take the government back, and we could never affect change, and we could never have a big effect, and that anyone who has success isn't real.
[02:40:12.671 --> 02:40:14.852]  Bull baloney garbage!
[02:40:15.876 --> 02:40:16.136]  Okay.
[02:40:32.432 --> 02:40:35.254]  The system pulled out all the stops.
[02:40:35.254 --> 02:40:38.996]  I mean, they clearly cheated in Nevada with Harry Reid, against Sharon Angle.
[02:40:38.996 --> 02:40:44.599]  And yeah, some of these Republicans are, you know, pro-war-ish or whatever, and I'm against those wars.
[02:40:44.599 --> 02:40:52.243]  The point is, you have admitted that you're a communist, and you've called probably a hundred times over the years, and you like government health care, and you like all this stuff.
[02:40:52.243 --> 02:40:53.063]  I don't.
[02:40:53.063 --> 02:40:53.603]  Okay?
[02:40:53.603 --> 02:40:54.324]  So, whatever.
[02:40:54.764 --> 02:41:03.489]  You know, Ron Paul exposes a CIA drug dealing, so do I. And to sit there, because I've heard it before from you, and say, you're espousing CIA propaganda.
[02:41:03.489 --> 02:41:05.050]  Baloney!
[02:41:05.050 --> 02:41:06.411]  Baloney!
[02:41:06.411 --> 02:41:07.251]  Okay?
[02:41:07.251 --> 02:41:10.633]  I'm here trailblazing, waking up the most people thanks to my list for spreading the word.
[02:41:10.633 --> 02:41:12.675]  Okay, now I've got to really go fast.
[02:41:12.675 --> 02:41:17.918]  It's just so irritating, you know, to hear his voice when I've heard it squeaking out there.
[02:41:17.918 --> 02:41:19.158]  Just lie about me all day.
[02:41:19.158 --> 02:41:20.239]  Tell some more lies.
[02:41:20.239 --> 02:41:21.300]  You know, go crazy.
[02:41:22.180 --> 02:41:24.161]  Uh, just tell more people about my show.
[02:41:24.161 --> 02:41:25.722]  Get the name spelled right.
[02:41:25.722 --> 02:41:27.923]  Alexander Emmerich Jones.
[02:41:27.923 --> 02:41:28.783]  Tell everybody about it.
[02:41:28.783 --> 02:41:29.964]  Tell them how bad I am.
[02:41:29.964 --> 02:41:31.244]  Please, continue.
[02:41:31.244 --> 02:41:36.286]  Send everybody to Infowars.com and presentbonnet.com, where they'll find out what I really stand for.
[02:41:36.286 --> 02:41:37.767]  Let's talk to Paul in Jersey.
[02:41:37.767 --> 02:41:39.488]  You're on the air, Paul.
[02:41:39.488 --> 02:41:40.168]  Hi, Alex.
[02:41:40.168 --> 02:41:45.411]  Um, I'm moving to a new town in New Jersey, and, uh, I was doing research on the fluoride levels.
[02:41:45.411 --> 02:41:48.392]  I filled her on my water anyway, but I just wanted to check.
[02:41:49.073 --> 02:41:54.735]  I found a report by the New Jersey Division of Family Health Services listing all the fluoride levels in New Jersey.
[02:41:54.735 --> 02:41:55.676]  Yes.
[02:41:55.676 --> 02:42:02.498]  And there's over 1,100 unique districts that have a unique water composition.
[02:42:02.498 --> 02:42:07.561]  Yeah, one part per million of sodium fluoride reduces IQ by more than 10 points.
[02:42:07.561 --> 02:42:11.482]  You can just search fluoride IQ levels, that's mainline news.
[02:42:11.482 --> 02:42:14.043]  Many cities have as high as five parts per million.
[02:42:14.043 --> 02:42:15.724]  What's the highest you see there in Jersey?
[02:42:16.397 --> 02:42:21.821]  The highest is in Anchora Psychiatric Hospital for the criminally insane.
[02:42:21.821 --> 02:42:24.664]  It's where they send the Michael Myers of New Jersey.
[02:42:24.664 --> 02:42:28.326]  That is number one out of 1,100 with 2.4 parts per million.
[02:42:28.326 --> 02:42:38.274]  Isn't it funny that they give the mental patients fluoride knowing it was first used in mental hospitals over a hundred years ago and then used by the Soviets and the Nazis?
[02:42:38.274 --> 02:42:39.976]  It's listed as number one and there's only
[02:42:40.920 --> 02:42:43.522]  New Jersey has the second lowest fluoride levels in the nation.
[02:42:43.522 --> 02:42:48.244]  There's only about 20 that have over one part, 20 towns that have over one part per million.
[02:42:48.244 --> 02:42:55.588]  And there's three towns that have over two, and the highest is 2.4 parts per million for a psychiatric hospital for the criminally insane.
[02:42:55.588 --> 02:42:57.289]  Isn't that interesting?
[02:42:57.289 --> 02:43:03.772]  Yeah, they're force-drugging all of us, and now they're on the news saying, we need to put lithium in the water to make everybody calm.
[02:43:03.772 --> 02:43:05.293]  Oh, and fluoride is helping you.
[02:43:05.293 --> 02:43:06.934]  It's a cognitive enhancer.
[02:43:06.934 --> 02:43:07.814]  I appreciate your call.
[02:43:07.814 --> 02:43:08.935]  I mean, did you have a question, Paul?
[02:43:09.727 --> 02:43:15.330]  You can find it if you Google New Jersey Division Family Health Services Fluoride Levels.
[02:43:15.330 --> 02:43:16.631]  Sure, sure.
[02:43:16.631 --> 02:43:21.653]  It's the health department set up for eugenics over 100 years ago in the U.S.
[02:43:21.653 --> 02:43:26.216]  that carries out the secret taking of blood from newborn babies, all of it.
[02:43:26.216 --> 02:43:28.717]  Let's go ahead and talk to Matt in Florida.
[02:43:28.717 --> 02:43:31.078]  Matt, you're on the air.
[02:43:31.078 --> 02:43:32.519]  Alright, what's going on Alex?
[02:43:32.519 --> 02:43:33.439]  Worldwide broadcast.
[02:43:33.439 --> 02:43:34.260]  Turn that radio off.
[02:43:34.260 --> 02:43:34.580]  Go ahead.
[02:43:35.496 --> 02:43:42.037]  Alright, I'm telling you, I think there's been a lot of chicanery down here in Florida with the Senate race.
[02:43:42.037 --> 02:43:43.278]  I don't trust Marco Rubio.
[02:43:43.278 --> 02:43:50.199]  I think he might be a neocon because go to dailypaul.com slash node slash 147239.
[02:43:50.199 --> 02:43:53.300]  Yeah, the best way is just give us the headline.
[02:43:53.300 --> 02:43:55.140]  People can't find it with a URL.
[02:43:55.140 --> 02:43:57.540]  What's the headline?
[02:43:57.540 --> 02:44:00.981]  It's a Daily Paul article about... I know, what's the headline?
[02:44:03.665 --> 02:44:14.252]  He brought Cap and Trade to Florida with legislation that gave the Florida Energy Commission pretty much the ability to set up a blueprint for it.
[02:44:14.252 --> 02:44:15.953]  That's horrible news!
[02:44:15.953 --> 02:44:16.813]  So what's the headline?
[02:44:17.814 --> 02:44:18.534]  That's what I said.
[02:44:18.534 --> 02:44:24.337]  We're going to find out who's good and who's bad and if the neocons are able to take over the Tea Party.
[02:44:24.337 --> 02:44:25.998]  It's a true populist movement.
[02:44:25.998 --> 02:44:27.679]  They're trying to take control of it.
[02:44:27.679 --> 02:44:28.940]  We're in a battle.
[02:44:28.940 --> 02:44:30.020]  And we need to... And there it is.
[02:44:30.020 --> 02:44:31.421]  What's up with Marco Rubio?
[02:44:31.421 --> 02:44:34.902]  And then if you click, it'll take you to the full article and whoever wrote it.
[02:44:34.902 --> 02:44:38.204]  It's Current Events wrote it.
[02:44:38.204 --> 02:44:42.426]  So you can go to Current Events and... No, no.
[02:44:42.426 --> 02:44:43.907]  I guess that's the section it's in.
[02:44:43.907 --> 02:44:45.368]  Well, I'll have to look that up.
[02:44:45.368 --> 02:44:45.828]  Anything else?
[02:44:46.909 --> 02:45:00.648]  Uh, well, the Daily Politico links to all the legislation, but the weirdest part is, in 2008, the Florida Energy Commission, when the legislation passed, was headed up by Harvey Reuven, who is a member of the UN Agenda 21.
[02:45:01.809 --> 02:45:03.030]  Horrible news.
[02:45:03.030 --> 02:45:05.011]  Guys, print me all the links to legislation.
[02:45:05.011 --> 02:45:06.292]  Print it all.
[02:45:06.292 --> 02:45:06.812]  Absolutely.
[02:45:06.812 --> 02:45:08.813]  That's what we're going to have to do is expose these people.
[02:45:08.813 --> 02:45:11.035]  Thank you so much.
[02:45:11.035 --> 02:45:13.516]  If that's true, that's super bad news.
[02:45:13.516 --> 02:45:17.379]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[02:45:17.379 --> 02:45:19.080]  Let's talk to... You know what?
[02:45:19.080 --> 02:45:20.241]  I promise to get to this.
[02:45:20.241 --> 02:45:21.161]  It's been our top story.
[02:45:21.161 --> 02:45:22.702]  I've mentioned it all day.
[02:45:22.702 --> 02:45:26.825]  And then we'll get to more phone calls if we have time here.
[02:45:26.825 --> 02:45:28.366]  I kind of got sidetracked.
[02:45:29.724 --> 02:45:41.534]  Now, again, the Google search term today is Steel Nevada, S-T-E-A-L, S-T-E-A-L, S-T-E-A-L, Nevada, and the alternate search is Read Steel Nevada.
[02:45:42.844 --> 02:45:44.905]  Did Harry Reid steal Nevada?
[02:45:44.905 --> 02:45:58.633]  Five-point margin of victory, highly suspicious given pre-election polls showing Engel ahead, combined with reports of vote-flipping on machines controlled by Reid's son and serviced by corrupt pro-Reid union.
[02:45:58.633 --> 02:46:02.715]  And remember, Sharon Engel was against eugenics and fluoride in the water.
[02:46:02.715 --> 02:46:07.058]  See, these candidates aren't perfect, but if they know you're a real person, they go after you.
[02:46:08.095 --> 02:46:31.971]  A serious investigation into potential vote fraud needs to be launched immediately in Nevada after incumbent Harry Reid beat Tea Party candidate Sharon Engel by a clear five points despite pre-election polls showing Engel four points ahead amidst suspicions, evidence of vote flipping and other dirty tricks on behalf of the Reid campaign last week that were dubbed criminal by Engel's campaign attorney.
[02:46:31.971 --> 02:46:34.373]  She said in the headline, Reid is going to steal this election.
[02:46:36.030 --> 02:46:41.852]  Angle clearly had the momentum going into the election, having come from behind to take the lead over the Senate Majority Leader.
[02:46:41.852 --> 02:46:47.393]  Four separate Rasmussen polls, which are highly respected, prior to the election, had Angle ahead.
[02:46:47.393 --> 02:46:54.255]  Two weeks before Super Tuesday, she held a 50% to 47% lead over Reid.
[02:46:54.255 --> 02:47:00.676]  One week prior to voting, on October 26th, her lead was extended to four points, with Angle at 49 and Reid at 45.
[02:47:02.737 --> 02:47:11.664]  The race was tight, but surveys clearly showed that Engel was generally and gradually extending her lead as each week went by.
[02:47:11.664 --> 02:47:26.377]  To have a nine-point swing from Engel enjoying a four-point lead just a week before the election to Reed winning the seat by a clear five points is highly suspicious, especially given the chicanery, there's that word again, that came to light just last week.
[02:47:27.313 --> 02:47:33.316]  Nine points is not within the margin of error for polls, especially those conducted by Rasmussen.
[02:47:33.316 --> 02:47:41.101]  Yeah, he's down by four, he wins by five, that's nine, which is considered to be one of the most, if not most, credible polling agency out there.
[02:47:41.101 --> 02:47:46.544]  When early voting started last week, reports out of Clark County, home to three-quarters of Nevada's residents, that's where
[02:47:47.403 --> 02:47:54.870]  Uh, you know, the main city of Las Vegas is, indicated that electronic voting machines were automatically checking Harry Reid's name on the ballot.
[02:47:54.870 --> 02:47:56.071]  That was all over mainstream news.
[02:47:56.071 --> 02:47:57.613]  Thousands of people reported it.
[02:47:57.613 --> 02:48:04.038]  The technicians that serviced those electronic voting machines were the ProReid SEIU, the folks always caught beating people up.
[02:48:05.014 --> 02:48:08.139]  The International Service Employees International Union.
[02:48:08.139 --> 02:48:14.167]  The same corrupt union that was behind thousands of bogus voter registration forms across the nation.
[02:48:14.167 --> 02:48:19.455]  The SEIU spent $44 million during the election cycle, nearly all of which went to Democrats.
[02:48:21.638 --> 02:48:30.102]  It continues, White House Political Director Patrick Gaspard is formally the SEIU's top lobbyist.
[02:48:30.102 --> 02:48:37.206]  And former SEIU President Andy Stern was the most frequent visitor to the White House last year, adds the Gateway Pundit.
[02:48:37.206 --> 02:48:44.530]  Furthermore, the county commissioner for Clark County is none other than Harry Reid's son Rory, and he runs the election.
[02:48:44.530 --> 02:48:45.731]  Got the union, got his son.
[02:48:47.068 --> 02:49:05.726]  In response to the allegations, as well as Reid's offer of free food and gift cards for people who voted, a move some slammed as bribery at Violates Election Laws, ANGLE campaign attorney Cleta Mitchell wrote in a fundraising letter that Reid intended to quote, steal this election if he can't win it outright.
[02:49:06.849 --> 02:49:18.235]  As a result, quote, we need to deploy literally dozens of election law attorneys and poll watchers to combat these tactics at a cost of nearly $80,000, wrote Mitchell.
[02:49:18.235 --> 02:49:20.117]  That's over and above our current budget.
[02:49:20.117 --> 02:49:21.317]  We need to raise $80,000.
[02:49:21.317 --> 02:49:22.198]  We need to do it right now.
[02:49:22.198 --> 02:49:23.979]  This was two weeks ago.
[02:49:23.979 --> 02:49:34.865]  Because even at the time of me writing this, Harry Reid and his machine are trying to steal this election, adding that the Reid campaign was engaged in, quote, dirty tricks and criminal tactics.
[02:49:35.987 --> 02:49:38.769]  Now, where is Sharon Engel today?
[02:49:38.769 --> 02:49:39.989]  I checked this morning, it wasn't there.
[02:49:39.989 --> 02:49:44.312]  Can somebody search, Sharon Engel challenges election results?
[02:49:44.312 --> 02:49:46.333]  Will you search that right now for me?
[02:49:46.333 --> 02:49:49.915]  Because I don't want to attack her and say she's laying down if it isn't true.
[02:49:49.915 --> 02:49:58.419]  You need to call Sharon Engel's office and say, look, we gave you money, we supported you, and now it looks like there's clear fraud, and we know there's conflict of interest.
[02:49:58.419 --> 02:49:59.900]  What are you doing?
[02:49:59.900 --> 02:50:02.502]  You've got to stand up for the election process.
[02:50:02.502 --> 02:50:04.763]  And again, I did this back when Democrats were being cheated.
[02:50:06.351 --> 02:50:07.972]  In 2000, 2004.
[02:50:07.972 --> 02:50:10.814]  Facts are facts, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:50:10.814 --> 02:50:15.698]  When the powerful are threatened, they will do anything to retain their position, concluded Mitchell in the letter.
[02:50:15.698 --> 02:50:16.819]  Where there's smoke, there's fire.
[02:50:16.819 --> 02:50:34.372]  We have evidence of voting tampering before the election, and lo and behold, establishment candidate Reid manages to pull a nine-point turnaround to save his seat using the electronic voting machines controlled by his own son and serviced by the corrupt union members loyal to him who've been caught out there with all this fake voter registration.
[02:50:34.972 --> 02:50:42.078]  There clearly needs to be an urgent and thorough investigation in a Nevada vote to maintain the integrity of the entire election process.
[02:50:42.078 --> 02:50:51.006]  The ANGLE campaign should immediately push for a full criminal investigation into potential vote fraud on behalf of Reid and his cronies.
[02:50:51.006 --> 02:50:53.668]  We'll be right back with more of your calls, some other key election news.
[02:50:53.668 --> 02:50:54.649]  I'll recap.
[02:50:54.649 --> 02:50:55.230]  Stay with us.
[02:50:55.230 --> 02:50:56.931]  InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:50:56.931 --> 02:50:57.331]  Stay with us.
[02:51:01.420 --> 02:51:05.524]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[02:51:05.524 --> 02:51:10.029]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[02:51:10.029 --> 02:51:16.175]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[02:51:16.175 --> 02:51:18.618]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[02:51:18.618 --> 02:51:24.584]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[02:51:24.704 --> 02:51:28.109]  With zero debt in 90 days, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[02:51:28.109 --> 02:51:29.991]  There is no other program of its kind.
[02:51:29.991 --> 02:51:32.174]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.

[02:55:48.302 --> 02:55:50.984]  Hey Alex, I just wanted to talk to you about numerology a little bit.
[02:55:50.984 --> 02:55:54.527]  The other day somebody called about 9-11 being reversed, so it would be November 9th.
[02:56:17.359 --> 02:56:30.564]  Uh, 2010, and he kind of stole my thunder, but then, it bothered me a little bit, but then I thought, well, we really need to steal the thunder of the elite, if they were planning to do something on that day, or not.
[02:56:30.564 --> 02:56:44.649]  Um, and then the other thing I wanted to mention really quick, uh, because I was listening to, um, an MP3 by, um, Byron, Byron Fagan, and also linking it a little bit with, uh,
[02:56:45.632 --> 02:56:46.513]  We're good to go.
[02:56:57.990 --> 02:57:03.512]  You could see in one shot there's this gas station that's showing the gas price at six dollars.
[02:57:03.512 --> 02:57:05.893]  Six dollars something, six dollars something, you know?
[02:57:05.893 --> 02:57:08.453]  Yeah, they love to tell you when they're going to release the bioweapon.
[02:57:08.453 --> 02:57:12.035]  They love to plant little things in movies and they've been caught doing that before.
[02:57:12.035 --> 02:57:23.899]  We don't know if I Am Legend has implanted that, but notice the government makes everybody take an anti-cancer vaccine and it causes almost the entire population to die, but a small percentage don't die.
[02:57:23.899 --> 02:57:24.439]  They become
[02:57:25.239 --> 02:57:28.541]  Yeah, the price of gas relates to what Lindsay Williams said.
[02:57:47.225 --> 02:57:50.427]  And also, you know, the 666, if you read it, you know.
[02:58:12.239 --> 02:58:15.081]  And we're going to have time to look at all these candidates that have won.
[02:58:15.081 --> 02:58:17.924]  Time to look at the dirty tricks that were played with Harry Reid and others.
[02:58:17.924 --> 02:58:24.209]  Didn't even get into a lot of the clear fraud against Tom Tancredo for governor in Colorado.
[02:58:24.209 --> 02:58:27.372]  But we've got to stand up for the integrity of the election system.
[02:58:27.372 --> 02:58:30.174]  We've got to continue to try to get patriots into office.
[02:58:30.174 --> 02:58:31.795]  Some of them won't be perfect.
[02:58:31.795 --> 02:58:33.056]  Some will get bought off.
[02:58:33.056 --> 02:58:37.580]  But the fact is, these issues we cover that are real issues are becoming mainstream.
