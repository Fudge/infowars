[00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.333]  WCAX-TV.
[00:00:04.333 --> 00:00:07.616]  And again, I got a bunch of calls about this, and I wasn't taking them serious.
[00:00:07.616 --> 00:00:10.979]  I was trying to make phone calls, and then Burmese was telling me about it, so I trust Burmese.
[00:00:10.979 --> 00:00:15.102]  I was taking that serious, and I was unable to confirm it.
[00:00:15.102 --> 00:00:16.243]  But I didn't want to go on air with it.
[00:00:16.243 --> 00:00:20.747]  SWAT teams, armored vehicles seen near Brown Compound.
[00:00:20.747 --> 00:00:22.209]  WCAX.
[00:00:22.209 --> 00:00:22.729]  Now watch.
[00:00:22.729 --> 00:00:25.231]  If nothing happens, I'll be blamed for this.
[00:00:25.231 --> 00:00:26.753]  Not WCAX-TV.
[00:00:28.138 --> 00:00:29.600]  They'll edit it, folks.
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.122]  People will edit this and they'll try to twist, but just later.
[00:00:32.122 --> 00:00:38.749]  And I won't have time to defend myself, but I hope to God they're not rating them.
[00:00:38.749 --> 00:00:40.972]  Everybody needs to get over there and we need to
[00:00:41.954 --> 00:00:50.957]  You know, peaceably stand in the way of this happening, and if they start pulling another Waco, trying to just machine gun into the place, then we need to have citizens arrested.
[00:00:50.957 --> 00:00:55.779]  These criminals, these armored goons that just engage in criminal activity.
[00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:58.320]  We need the governor to block the feds from doing this.
[00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.081]  We need the county sheriff to tell these, these are feds doing this, that they don't have jurisdiction.
[00:01:04.081 --> 00:01:05.562]  This is just absolutely criminal.
[00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:18.218]  Neighbors of convicted tax evaders Ed and Elaine Brown reported police SWAT teams and at least one armored vehicle converged on a field near the Browns' Plainfield, New Hampshire home this morning.
[00:01:18.218 --> 00:01:22.101]  See, I would have loved to have been able to tell you this off-rumor, but we tried to make calls and we've...
[00:01:23.473 --> 00:01:24.534]  Now I feel guilty for that.
[00:01:24.534 --> 00:01:25.715]  I just can't win.
[00:01:25.715 --> 00:01:30.599]  Federal and state authorities haven't commented on whether they are moving in to arrest the fugitives.
[00:01:30.599 --> 00:01:31.439]  That means they are.
[00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.441]  That means they probably are.
[00:01:33.441 --> 00:01:35.803]  And the local police, the Governor's office and the U.S.
[00:01:35.803 --> 00:01:38.345]  Attorney's office referred calls to the U.S.
[00:01:38.345 --> 00:01:44.430]  Marshal's office, which has been negotiating with the Browns since their tax evasion conviction.
[00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.771]  We need to get a map of his house.
[00:01:45.771 --> 00:01:47.552]  I know we already have that of where he's at.
[00:01:47.552 --> 00:01:49.534]  Get it up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:01:49.534 --> 00:01:51.576]  We need to get this article up there and we need to
[00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.750]  I think so.
[00:02:14.537 --> 00:02:27.652]  A neighbor who lives a mile or so away from the Browns on center of town roads said she saw police officers, SWAT team members, a fire truck, ambulance, helicopter, and at least one armored vehicle assembled in a field across from her driveway.
[00:02:27.652 --> 00:02:35.941]  Brown told a blog interviewer this morning he's been getting calls from people reporting police in the town and said he lost power twice during the night.
[00:02:37.603 --> 00:02:41.464]  The Browns had been sentenced to five and a half years in tax evasion.
[00:02:41.464 --> 00:02:47.205]  They skipped their sentencing hearings, and Ed Brown said he and his wife will refuse to surrender.
[00:02:47.205 --> 00:02:48.245]  God bless them.
[00:02:48.245 --> 00:02:49.166]  Poor people, man.
[00:02:49.166 --> 00:02:50.166]  Pray for them.
[00:02:50.166 --> 00:02:53.967]  It may already be over, or the feds may back off.
[00:02:53.967 --> 00:02:55.127]  I don't know.
[00:02:55.127 --> 00:02:56.167]  We're trying to cover it here.
[00:02:56.167 --> 00:03:00.328]  I want to thank those that did call here and tell me of the rumors.
[00:03:00.328 --> 00:03:03.889]  Those are now semi-confirmed, I hope it's not true, from the AP.
[00:03:05.433 --> 00:03:09.776]  A little mini Alamo may be taking place right now.
[00:03:09.776 --> 00:03:11.638]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:03:11.638 --> 00:03:14.581]  We'll try to learn more.
[00:03:14.581 --> 00:03:15.982]  We're on the march.
[00:03:15.982 --> 00:03:18.504]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:03:18.504 --> 00:03:21.187]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:03:24.403 --> 00:03:27.564]  We would all love to live in a world with clean air and water.
[00:03:27.564 --> 00:03:33.726]  A world in which our produce is grown naturally, without the use of pesticides and other harmful chemicals.
[00:03:33.726 --> 00:03:36.047]  But the truth is, we don't live in such a world.
[00:03:36.047 --> 00:03:45.230]  These toxins enter our bodies, and the organ in our body that works hard to eliminate these toxins is the liver, which is one of the most complex and important organs in the human body.
[00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:56.633]  With more than 500 vital functions, give your liver the helping hand it needs with LIV52, the world's best-selling all-natural liver support formula in over 76 countries.
[00:03:56.633 --> 00:03:59.714]  And it's backed by over 300 clinical trials and studies.
[00:03:59.714 --> 00:04:07.016]  LIV52 is the most researched herbal formula that helps neutralize toxins from food, water, air, alcohol, and prescription medications.
[00:04:07.396 --> 00:04:12.961]  To order Live 52 and for the best source of researched herbal products, visit research-herbs.com or call 1-800-973-1482.
[00:04:12.961 --> 00:04:15.242]  That's research-herbs.com or call 1-800-973-1482 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.131]  Hi, this is Brother Michael Diamond from Most Holy Family Monastery.
[00:04:28.131 --> 00:04:31.053]  We are now offering a critically important $10 package.
[00:04:31.053 --> 00:04:43.618]  The package contains 3 DVDs with 10 different programs, our new 658-page book called The Truth About What Really Happened to the Catholic Church After Vatican II, which is the most comprehensive book ever produced on what has happened to the Catholic Church in the last 50 years.
[00:04:44.138 --> 00:04:44.678]  I think so.
[00:05:06.408 --> 00:05:12.616]  Well, you can mail in your order to us at Most Holy Family Monastery, 4425 Schneider Road, Fillmore, New York, 14735.
[00:05:12.616 --> 00:05:20.427]  The price of the whole package is $10, which includes media mail shipping, $15 for UPS ground or $30 outside the U.S.
[00:05:20.427 --> 00:05:22.550]  Mostholyfamilymonastery.com.
[00:05:24.051 --> 00:05:28.314]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[00:05:28.314 --> 00:05:31.876]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[00:05:31.876 --> 00:05:35.618]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[00:05:35.618 --> 00:05:38.900]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:44.403]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the disease that we see.
[00:05:44.403 --> 00:05:49.566]  When we do our program, you know, in herpal form it's like Cardivite and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill.
[00:05:49.966 --> 00:05:50.647]  Thank you!
[00:06:07.481 --> 00:06:11.968]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[00:06:11.968 --> 00:06:13.470]  That toll free number again 1-877-928-8822.
[00:06:43.238 --> 00:06:47.759]  Ed Brown was just a mainline guy paying his quote taxes.
[00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:51.860]  Then the government raided him, beat him up.
[00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:52.960]  I'm really paraphrasing.
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:57.581]  I'm trying to condense it down.
[00:06:57.581 --> 00:06:58.481]  It happened repeatedly.
[00:07:10.106 --> 00:07:11.667]  Tried to claim they had weapons.
[00:07:11.667 --> 00:07:13.528]  Tried to claim they were a threat.
[00:07:13.528 --> 00:07:14.708]  Beat them up in the courtroom.
[00:07:14.708 --> 00:07:16.909]  Just all, you know, the normal stuff they do.
[00:07:16.909 --> 00:07:17.489]  But criminals!
[00:07:17.489 --> 00:07:21.691]  Criminals run the country, and they... Most of them are so psychopathic, they don't even know they're criminals.
[00:07:21.691 --> 00:07:24.573]  I think it's just their right to feed on us.
[00:07:24.573 --> 00:07:29.775]  And, uh... They just got sick of it, and he said, you know what?
[00:07:29.775 --> 00:07:32.156]  I'm just gonna sit here in my house.
[00:07:32.156 --> 00:07:35.798]  And, uh, he said, I'm not gonna pay all the money you claim I owe, even though they had it to pay.
[00:07:35.798 --> 00:07:37.519]  They just said, come kill us.
[00:07:37.519 --> 00:07:38.159]  We're gonna fight you.
[00:07:39.648 --> 00:07:41.009]  Just come on!
[00:07:41.009 --> 00:07:46.831]  And then the Feds did what they always did with the Indianapolis Baptist Temple, and they stole that and took that church and all the other things they've done.
[00:07:46.831 --> 00:07:48.972]  They wait six months, a year.
[00:07:48.972 --> 00:07:50.532]  They wait until everybody forgets about it.
[00:07:50.532 --> 00:07:52.213]  They wait until the crowds leave.
[00:07:52.213 --> 00:07:55.894]  They wait until everybody backs off, and then they come in.
[00:07:55.894 --> 00:07:58.855]  This may even be SWAT team training in the neighborhood.
[00:07:58.855 --> 00:08:05.818]  This may even be them as a probing move to test the response of the American people.
[00:08:06.491 --> 00:08:07.852]  Or it may already be over.
[00:08:07.852 --> 00:08:09.014]  We don't know.
[00:08:09.014 --> 00:08:30.093]  Anyone that is in Plainfield, New Hampshire, the Live Free or Die State, where they now arrest reporters for asking questions, that's why that story is so important, because it just shows the police state we're living in, and what Matt and Luke and others went through.
[00:08:30.093 --> 00:08:32.235]  The Live Free or Die, the Patrick Henry State,
[00:08:33.602 --> 00:08:46.048]  Swat teams armored vehicle seen near brown compound and it says brown told a blog interviewer this morning he'd been getting calls okay blog interviewer whoever you are you know the mainstream media will never source
[00:08:46.798 --> 00:08:47.819]  The alternative media.
[00:08:47.819 --> 00:08:57.005]  They'll tell you what they said and use their reporting, but never, because they're in competition with us, they realize we're destroying them, they'll never give you a link so you can actually find out what really happened.
[00:08:57.005 --> 00:09:16.299]  So, I'm getting all these calls at the office, I don't know who's who, we're overwhelmed here, just call in, not on any other issue right now, not on immigration, not on Ron Paul debate being rigged, we've got that news confirmed, not on Luke and Matt being grabbed by the state police in New Hampshire,
[00:09:17.111 --> 00:09:19.752]  That's all coming up later.
[00:09:19.752 --> 00:09:24.993]  Not on the CPS grabbing a 9-11 truther's child.
[00:09:24.993 --> 00:09:25.913]  That's coming up.
[00:09:25.913 --> 00:09:28.414]  Right now, it's Ed Brown.
[00:09:28.414 --> 00:09:33.755]  And I'm asking you, the listeners, specifically if you know, specifically if you talk to Ed Brown.
[00:09:33.755 --> 00:09:35.936]  I know a lot of you talk to him.
[00:09:35.936 --> 00:09:37.116]  Specifically the blogs.
[00:09:37.116 --> 00:09:41.457]  I know Luke and others, if they had time in New Hampshire, were going to interview Ed Brown.
[00:09:41.457 --> 00:09:42.517]  I don't know if they did that.
[00:09:42.517 --> 00:09:43.237]  I never asked.
[00:09:43.237 --> 00:09:45.358]  Maybe we need to get Luke on the line.
[00:09:47.051 --> 00:09:47.772]  My poor producer.
[00:09:47.772 --> 00:09:50.174]  I mean, they're shouting 15 orders at him during the break.
[00:09:50.174 --> 00:09:51.434]  Because it's just too much going on.
[00:09:51.434 --> 00:09:52.475]  I'm trying to make phone calls.
[00:09:52.475 --> 00:09:54.517]  I'm just letting you know where we're at right now.
[00:09:54.517 --> 00:09:55.057]  Help us.
[00:09:55.057 --> 00:09:55.678]  Find out.
[00:09:55.678 --> 00:09:56.579]  Do you live in New Hampshire?
[00:09:56.579 --> 00:09:57.379]  Do you live nearby?
[00:09:57.379 --> 00:09:58.580]  Get on your cell phone.
[00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:00.181]  Drive by Ed's house.
[00:10:00.181 --> 00:10:01.202]  You're an hour away.
[00:10:01.202 --> 00:10:02.083]  Don't wait.
[00:10:02.083 --> 00:10:02.964]  Get in your car.
[00:10:02.964 --> 00:10:05.405]  Start driving over there right now.
[00:10:05.405 --> 00:10:07.547]  And the feds may be doing this on purpose.
[00:10:07.547 --> 00:10:09.409]  To cry wolf a couple times.
[00:10:09.409 --> 00:10:11.250]  To do these drills a couple times.
[00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:16.174]  And so, the third time, just like with Indianapolis Temple, the fourth time, they'll go ahead and move in.
[00:10:17.634 --> 00:10:19.898]  They may have cut his line and cut his power.
[00:10:19.898 --> 00:10:21.640]  That's what this sounds like is a PSYOP.
[00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:24.244]  They cut his power twice, cut his phone line.
[00:10:24.244 --> 00:10:25.747]  They've done this in land grabs too.
[00:10:26.805 --> 00:10:31.647]  Uh... messing with him so he'll put out the alarm so when he finally does put it out you don't respond.
[00:10:31.647 --> 00:10:38.849]  That could be what's happening or Ed and Elaine Brown could have already been SWAT teamed and Lor- I mean that's- it runs the gamut.
[00:10:38.849 --> 00:10:49.013]  It runs the gamut from the SWAT team was doing drills you know a mile from his house and people saw it and it's the local college or the local city or county.
[00:10:49.013 --> 00:10:49.893]  Or it could be
[00:10:52.061 --> 00:10:56.563]  That it's the Feds getting ready to move in, or they've already moved in and there's already been a firefight.
[00:10:56.563 --> 00:10:58.404]  We don't know!
[00:10:58.404 --> 00:11:02.746]  That's why, and I don't live in New Hampshire.
[00:11:02.746 --> 00:11:05.868]  If I'd have known, you know, a day before, a week before, I'd have got on a plane and gone up there.
[00:11:05.868 --> 00:11:07.408]  I know many of you have.
[00:11:07.408 --> 00:11:10.030]  And we've sent InfoWars.com reporters there before.
[00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:11.831]  We've interviewed Ed.
[00:11:11.831 --> 00:11:13.791]  Back when all this started breaking, what, a year ago.
[00:11:13.791 --> 00:11:14.652]  But the point is,
[00:11:15.607 --> 00:11:30.495]  Ed Brown, Elaine Brown, making a stand for the American people, saying, this far and no further, gimme liberty or gimme death in the gimme liberty or gimme death state, New Hampshire.
[00:11:30.495 --> 00:11:32.736]  This is huge!
[00:11:32.736 --> 00:11:37.179]  This is history happening, if this indeed is taking place.
[00:11:37.179 --> 00:11:41.281]  Now, again, my enemies are going to take the last five minutes and edit it.
[00:11:41.281 --> 00:11:43.642]  I'm reading this, I'm covering this from WC
[00:11:45.775 --> 00:11:48.637]  AXTV News 3.
[00:11:48.637 --> 00:11:50.357]  We knew about this before Showtime.
[00:11:50.357 --> 00:11:51.978]  I started getting calls this morning.
[00:11:51.978 --> 00:11:52.999]  I tried to confirm it.
[00:11:52.999 --> 00:11:53.839]  I couldn't.
[00:11:53.839 --> 00:11:55.740]  I didn't know the people that were calling me.
[00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:58.942]  I tried to call Ed.
[00:11:58.942 --> 00:12:00.602]  I'd heard false alarms before.
[00:12:00.602 --> 00:12:02.563]  Then Burmese called me.
[00:12:02.563 --> 00:12:07.546]  I don't know what's going on.
[00:12:07.546 --> 00:12:11.928]  I just know that this is in the news and this looks like something could be happening.
[00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:13.640]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:14.260]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:26.223]  John Harmon up in Minnesota running things, answering the phones, literally like an octopus doing the job of three people.
[00:12:26.223 --> 00:12:31.845]  Now, have you gotten any calls yet, people specifically, who talked to Ed today or yesterday, or who are in the nearby area?
[00:12:38.172 --> 00:12:39.372]  Okay, Fred Smart.
[00:12:39.372 --> 00:12:42.193]  Yes, I've heard Fred on the air, I believe.
[00:12:42.193 --> 00:12:43.194]  Fred Smart.
[00:12:43.194 --> 00:12:45.715]  Call Fred Smart right now, please.
[00:12:45.715 --> 00:12:46.975]  Let's get him on the line.
[00:12:46.975 --> 00:12:56.479]  I may have to push back the father who's had his son kidnapped because he dared have a 9-11 truth sign.
[00:12:56.479 --> 00:13:00.400]  I'm telling you folks, it's like I'm in a lifeboat with millions of hands reaching up.
[00:13:02.864 --> 00:13:05.865]  Just walk a mile in our shoes, and that's what makes me so angry.
[00:13:05.865 --> 00:13:07.946]  That's what makes me so aggressive.
[00:13:07.946 --> 00:13:10.086]  And people don't understand it.
[00:13:10.086 --> 00:13:12.467]  You know, they hear the passion and they get confused.
[00:13:12.467 --> 00:13:15.549]  They think I'm either nuts or I'm an egomaniac.
[00:13:15.549 --> 00:13:17.850]  No, it's because I'm in life and death mode here, folks.
[00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:20.130]  I know the cost, okay?
[00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:21.771]  I'm fired up.
[00:13:21.771 --> 00:13:22.932]  Let's go to Fred Smart.
[00:13:22.932 --> 00:13:25.132]  Fred Smart, where are you today?
[00:13:25.132 --> 00:13:26.393]  Hey Alex, I'm here in Chicago.
[00:13:27.179 --> 00:13:30.881]  Okay, you know Ed Brown well.
[00:13:30.881 --> 00:13:35.463]  Tell us basically about yourself real quick, so we know who you are, and then give us the latest.
[00:13:35.463 --> 00:13:50.590]  Well, real quick, you know, we have, myself and a bunch of people, once we heard about Ed and Elaine early January, got the word out, email, blogs, whatever, and we've been doing a daily show on Republic, getting their voice out.
[00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:53.792]  Got a call early this morning from Elaine.
[00:13:53.792 --> 00:13:56.373]  She had left a message as early as 6 o'clock my time.
[00:13:57.428 --> 00:14:04.272]  Reno, who is a decorated Desert Storm veteran, was just staying with them while his belongings were at the house.
[00:14:04.272 --> 00:14:05.652]  Went to walk the dog early.
[00:14:05.652 --> 00:14:08.374]  45 minutes later, the dog came back.
[00:14:08.374 --> 00:14:10.735]  Reno never came back.
[00:14:10.735 --> 00:14:21.660]  Within the same half hour, Ed got a call and some friends in South Lebanon along the road had noticed several armed personnel carriers were heading south toward Plainfield.
[00:14:23.715 --> 00:14:26.116]  So, they still had communications.
[00:14:26.116 --> 00:14:36.399]  We got a couple of audio blogs going, an hour conference call, a few people called in, sent out some emails, tried to encourage other people to send out emails.
[00:14:36.399 --> 00:14:41.321]  I just tried calling their line, their line has been disconnected now officially.
[00:14:41.321 --> 00:14:52.044]  So, we have no communication with them, other than if they were on the internet, I would presume they have a satellite connection, but I'm sure they're not staring at their computer right now.
[00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:57.026]  So we have a couple of people driving there and hopefully...
[00:14:58.499 --> 00:15:01.000]  There's going to be more intelligence on what's really happening.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:06.922]  Okay, I want you to, again, repeat everything you just said with any other details that you left out.
[00:15:06.922 --> 00:15:08.403]  Take your time.
[00:15:08.403 --> 00:15:16.706]  Fred Smart, who, again, has been co-hosting a show on the Republic Network with Ed Brown the last four or five months.
[00:15:16.706 --> 00:15:18.347]  I guess it was six months.
[00:15:18.347 --> 00:15:24.269]  Tell us exactly, slowly, when you first got the call, what Ed said, word for word.
[00:15:24.269 --> 00:15:26.790]  Go back and just flesh it out.
[00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:34.792]  As we debrief you here, just really think about exactly what Ed said, because every piece of intel, as you know, is very important.
[00:15:34.792 --> 00:15:44.235]  Well, I was on my way to drive my son to school, and I gave Elaine a call just out of the blue.
[00:15:44.235 --> 00:15:45.795]  Something told me to call.
[00:15:45.795 --> 00:15:48.716]  And I got up strangely early this morning.
[00:15:48.716 --> 00:15:52.457]  I felt something was up, and I wasn't even thinking about Elaine.
[00:15:52.457 --> 00:15:55.998]  But then I got in the car, and Elaine said, Fred, I've been trying to call you, trying to call you.
[00:15:56.761 --> 00:15:59.964]  Yeah, we got a high alert situation and I said, what's going on?
[00:15:59.964 --> 00:16:06.991]  She said, well, Reno left to walk the dog 45 minutes later, the dog came back and Reno didn't come back.
[00:16:06.991 --> 00:16:18.902]  And we've since gotten word that some friends have spotted several armed personnel carriers with troops heading on the main highway toward Plainfield.
[00:16:21.053 --> 00:16:29.119]  By troops, I mean they look like regular Army or Marines, or they're just dressed up in the regular terrorist enforcer outfits.
[00:16:29.119 --> 00:16:37.425]  All I know is he used some terminology, FTVs or AF, it was just, I don't know the lingo.
[00:16:37.425 --> 00:16:40.427]  APCs, Armored Personnel Carrier.
[00:16:40.427 --> 00:16:43.549]  And there's LAVs, Light Armored Vehicles.
[00:16:43.549 --> 00:16:44.450]  Okay.
[00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:45.490]  It wasn't an LAV.
[00:16:48.627 --> 00:17:10.102]  And on top of that, Ed said that yesterday a Cessna did a couple of flybys mid-afternoon, and then at night, around 8.30, 9 o'clock their time, a completely silent drone with a very high-beam light circled their property.
[00:17:11.291 --> 00:17:13.512]  Uh, at that time.
[00:17:13.512 --> 00:17:14.872]  And it's fun for these guys.
[00:17:14.872 --> 00:17:18.073]  Most of these guys are into hunting, which I'm not saying is a bad thing.
[00:17:18.073 --> 00:17:22.354]  But to them, I mean, I've seen videos of the cops behind the scenes, especially with patriots.
[00:17:22.354 --> 00:17:24.495]  They love killing us.
[00:17:24.495 --> 00:17:26.575]  And especially children at Waco.
[00:17:26.575 --> 00:17:29.316]  Literally, they celebrate, hold up skulls of dead babies.
[00:17:29.316 --> 00:17:29.936]  It's real fun.
[00:17:30.676 --> 00:17:32.677]  And it's a big hunting trip.
[00:17:32.677 --> 00:17:37.879]  They're chewing tobacco and they go to the topless bar the night before and it's high fives and all their gear.
[00:17:37.879 --> 00:17:39.280]  It's hunting humans.
[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:40.220]  It's a lot of fun.
[00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:41.981]  This is so sick.
[00:17:41.981 --> 00:17:51.045]  And I want them all to know it's the Alamo and every one of them that takes part in this criminal raid is going to be known as a traitor forever.
[00:17:51.045 --> 00:17:52.805]  But you don't have to worry about the American people.
[00:17:52.805 --> 00:17:53.786]  You've got God.
[00:17:54.466 --> 00:17:58.687]  Just guaranteed to curse you for what you're doing, but this is the Alamo.
[00:17:58.687 --> 00:17:59.587]  This is happening.
[00:17:59.587 --> 00:18:01.468]  Please could you tell us about this?
[00:18:01.468 --> 00:18:03.749]  Now what Ed said about this this drone?
[00:18:03.749 --> 00:18:07.510]  Okay, Ed just said it was it was strange.
[00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:09.350]  It was completely silent.
[00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:10.551]  This is at night.
[00:18:10.551 --> 00:18:11.951]  It was at night.
[00:18:11.951 --> 00:18:17.092]  It cruised in the air overhead with a bright bright beaming light.
[00:18:17.092 --> 00:18:18.413]  Can't put it on the border.
[00:18:18.413 --> 00:18:22.774]  By the way, they're going to give all the illegal aliens, and this is in the bill, total tax
[00:18:24.349 --> 00:18:31.354]  Amnesty, literal, literal pardons on all their back taxes, but not Ed and Elaine Brown.
[00:18:31.354 --> 00:18:33.615]  Boy, they've got to be taken out.
[00:18:33.615 --> 00:18:36.136]  What time did this happen?
[00:18:36.136 --> 00:18:41.920]  The drone was spotted 8.30, 9 o'clock their time.
[00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:47.503]  It was toward the dusk side, and there were a lot of trees around the area.
[00:18:47.503 --> 00:18:48.444]  They had open space.
[00:18:51.656 --> 00:18:53.078]  It was really strange yesterday.
[00:18:53.078 --> 00:19:02.788]  My phone has gone out several times in the last 24 hours, which has never ever happened with that frequency.
[00:19:02.788 --> 00:19:09.514]  Another gentleman was on the show with Ed and Elaine yesterday.
[00:19:09.514 --> 00:19:11.356]  Obviously, they will not be on the show today.
[00:19:12.706 --> 00:19:13.267]  I think so.
[00:19:31.648 --> 00:19:32.148]  We're good to go.
[00:19:56.183 --> 00:19:58.644]  You know, bloody inventions out there.
[00:19:58.644 --> 00:20:04.106]  The main thing is, who do you have in contact locally, liaisons locally, that can drive by the house?
[00:20:04.106 --> 00:20:06.147]  That's the key.
[00:20:06.147 --> 00:20:11.608]  Well, I've put in a couple phone calls, and some other people have put in phone calls.
[00:20:11.608 --> 00:20:13.709]  I've talked with two people.
[00:20:13.709 --> 00:20:25.013]  There's a volunteer, a gentleman from Missouri, and myself, and a guy from Vermont, who is driving on his way, about an hour's drive, 45 minutes to an hour's drive, another gentleman in New Hampshire.
[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:25.900]  We're good.
[00:20:48.789 --> 00:20:53.373]  And some people can, I don't know if they're cordoned off the highways and the roads around the house?
[00:20:53.373 --> 00:20:56.475]  Well, I know people have pledged to always keep certain numbers there.
[00:20:56.475 --> 00:20:57.817]  Well, that'll confirm it right there.
[00:20:57.817 --> 00:21:09.046]  If you try to get within a half mile of the house and there's some goons out there, waddling around with an armored vehicle or an armored truck, you know that they're there and you know it's going down.
[00:21:09.753 --> 00:21:10.053]  Yeah.
[00:21:10.053 --> 00:21:12.555]  If he does, I don't know if they've been jammed yet.
[00:21:12.555 --> 00:21:14.037]  I don't have any other number to call.
[00:21:32.467 --> 00:21:35.891]  Fred, give us your blog or give us any other good blogs.
[00:21:35.891 --> 00:21:40.536]  Are you the blogger that the Plainfield Associated Press talk to?
[00:21:43.042 --> 00:21:46.045]  Well, we've had several people maintain the blog.
[00:21:46.045 --> 00:21:47.226]  I'm one of them.
[00:21:47.226 --> 00:21:48.988]  I started it with another gentleman.
[00:21:48.988 --> 00:21:56.855]  I'm just trying to find out who the AP is, because this is unjournalistic to cite a blog and then not show the blog.
[00:21:56.855 --> 00:22:00.299]  And again, I'm not mad about the AP being a bunch of scumbags and mainstream.
[00:22:00.299 --> 00:22:04.783]  I just want to know who it was, because they're not engaged in journalistic activity here.
[00:22:06.004 --> 00:22:07.584]  I'm trying to find out, yeah.
[00:22:07.584 --> 00:22:09.525]  Well, we need to find out who this local blog is.
[00:22:09.525 --> 00:22:11.705]  We need to find out who these eyewitnesses are.
[00:22:11.705 --> 00:22:13.066]  We need them to call in right now.
[00:22:13.066 --> 00:22:24.808]  John, have we had anybody else call in on the 1-800-259-9231 number who's nearby or is in New Hampshire or in Plainfield?
[00:22:24.808 --> 00:22:26.328]  Just unbelievable.
[00:22:26.328 --> 00:22:28.529]  You know, Alex, it's interesting.
[00:22:28.529 --> 00:22:31.149]  You know what today's date is?
[00:22:31.149 --> 00:22:32.990]  Is it in history?
[00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:33.230]  No. 1967.
[00:22:38.391 --> 00:22:41.234]  Okay, just to refresh my memory, what happened in 1967?
[00:22:41.234 --> 00:22:44.517]  This is when the Six Day War began.
[00:22:44.517 --> 00:22:45.198]  Oh, it is!
[00:22:45.198 --> 00:22:50.263]  And then the 40th anniversary of the Liberty is coming up in just a few days.
[00:22:50.263 --> 00:22:51.724]  Yep.
[00:22:51.724 --> 00:22:53.967]  So this is all, you know, it's 40 years later.
[00:22:53.967 --> 00:22:58.111]  It's just kind of interesting.
[00:22:59.421 --> 00:23:00.362]  Amazing.
[00:23:00.362 --> 00:23:03.844]  Ed and Elaine are just wonderful people.
[00:23:03.844 --> 00:23:06.046]  They're peaceful, they're civil.
[00:23:06.046 --> 00:23:12.050]  Yes, Ed has a rough edge to him, but by God, they are true blue American patriots.
[00:23:13.379 --> 00:23:14.779]  Well, this is horrible news.
[00:23:14.779 --> 00:23:18.121]  I mean, it's in the Associated Press that people are saying this.
[00:23:18.121 --> 00:23:23.602]  Why doesn't the lazy AP, this is huge news, get in their vehicles and drive over there?
[00:23:23.602 --> 00:23:25.283]  This is what we need to do.
[00:23:25.283 --> 00:23:27.143]  Everybody needs to do this for me, because we don't have the staff.
[00:23:27.143 --> 00:23:28.044]  We're going to try to.
[00:23:28.044 --> 00:23:31.425]  Call the plane-filled TV stations, plane-filled radio stations.
[00:23:31.425 --> 00:23:33.125]  Get the radio to go out there.
[00:23:33.125 --> 00:23:35.466]  In fact, let me tell my producer, please get
[00:23:36.494 --> 00:23:39.457]  Go Google the Plainfield AM talk station.
[00:23:39.457 --> 00:23:43.961]  Call them and say, are you going down there to cover what could be one of the biggest stories of the year?
[00:23:43.961 --> 00:23:45.343]  Get over there and cover this.
[00:23:45.343 --> 00:23:46.884]  People's lives are in the balance.
[00:23:46.884 --> 00:23:50.488]  This could be a new Waco we're talking about.
[00:23:50.488 --> 00:23:53.150]  Who knows what could have already happened, or it could just be a drill.
[00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:58.756]  You know, the feds do try to test things and see who's in the woodwork, see who may be in that area.
[00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:01.121]  What do you think is going on?
[00:24:01.121 --> 00:24:11.546]  I mean, bottom line... Cameras and video cameras and just the biggest thing is to provide transparency and accountability in the form of recording what they witness, what they see.
[00:24:11.546 --> 00:24:12.766]  Fred Smart, stay there.
[00:24:12.766 --> 00:24:15.508]  I want to come back and ask you where you think all this is going.
[00:24:15.508 --> 00:24:16.488]  What's your gut is?
[00:24:16.488 --> 00:24:21.131]  I mean, if they're cutting his phones and cut his power and he saw drones, it doesn't look good.
[00:24:21.131 --> 00:24:21.771]  We'll be right back.
[00:24:27.623 --> 00:24:33.450]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:24:33.450 --> 00:24:41.098]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:24:41.778 --> 00:24:49.221]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:24:49.221 --> 00:25:00.966]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:25:00.966 --> 00:25:04.928]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:25:04.928 --> 00:25:07.189]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:25:07.189 --> 00:25:11.051]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:26:26.316 --> 00:26:30.338]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[00:26:30.338 --> 00:26:39.424]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions, credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more, all in the hands of a total stranger.
[00:26:39.424 --> 00:26:44.547]  What's worse is you realize he got it through your front door because you left it unlocked.
[00:26:44.547 --> 00:26:45.367]  Every time you walk
[00:26:45.367 --> 00:26:48.149]  Walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on.
[00:26:48.149 --> 00:26:53.892]  You are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.

[00:28:11.674 --> 00:28:12.455]  Welcome back.
[00:28:12.455 --> 00:28:14.719]  We've got breaking news here.
[00:28:14.719 --> 00:28:17.463]  Police assembled by Brown's home.
[00:28:17.463 --> 00:28:19.407]  Another article here.
[00:28:20.419 --> 00:28:22.341]  This is out of the Union Leader newspaper.
[00:28:22.341 --> 00:28:27.025]  Let's get the Union Leader reporter Pat Groffsmith and Kristen Sins on.
[00:28:27.025 --> 00:28:29.327]  It's definitely on, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:28:29.327 --> 00:28:31.930]  It's definitely something going on there.
[00:28:31.930 --> 00:28:34.132]  And I'm sorry we were cautious at the start of the show.
[00:28:34.132 --> 00:28:35.793]  We have to do that here.
[00:28:35.793 --> 00:28:37.695]  I'm actually extremely cautious with what we cover.
[00:28:38.776 --> 00:28:41.638]  And, of course, we always get blamed for doing the opposite.
[00:28:41.638 --> 00:28:44.861]  Dozens of heavily armed state police and federal agents have assembled.
[00:28:44.861 --> 00:28:45.982]  It is confirmed.
[00:28:45.982 --> 00:28:48.064]  Confirmed, confirmed, confirmed.
[00:28:48.064 --> 00:28:50.266]  It's up on PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[00:28:50.266 --> 00:28:54.830]  Dozens of heavily armed, and stay with us, Fred Smart, I want to bring you back up.
[00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:56.071]  Let me get this article out.
[00:28:56.071 --> 00:29:03.938]  Dozens of heavily armed state police and federal agents have assembled near the rural Grafton County home of tax protester Ed and Elaine Brown.
[00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:27.818]  About 50 state troopers, some armed with high-powered rifles, the state working with the globalist private IRS, along with a vehicle from an explosives unit, oh that's so they can imply they've got bombs, gathered this morning in Plainfield, a town where Edward and Elaine Brown have been holed up in their home since being convicted of tax evasion and sentencing to leaky federal prison sentences.
[00:29:27.818 --> 00:29:30.901]  The Browns have been aware of the increased police activity all morning,
[00:29:31.321 --> 00:29:41.524]  In an audio file posted on a blog this morning, he said a silent aircraft at about 5,000 feet... Notice they don't ever give credit to... That's just normal!
[00:29:41.524 --> 00:29:43.164]  You're supposed to link to your source!
[00:29:43.164 --> 00:29:45.085]  No, they just take it!
[00:29:45.085 --> 00:29:48.686]  That is total journalistic scammery!
[00:29:48.686 --> 00:29:51.667]  And again, it isn't about who gets the credit, it's that we need that info!
[00:29:51.667 --> 00:29:53.367]  We want to go to the original source!
[00:29:53.367 --> 00:29:54.728]  That's why you're supposed to do it!
[00:29:54.728 --> 00:29:56.168]  That's what we do in our articles!
[00:29:58.029 --> 00:29:59.409]  You're supposed to source them by name.
[00:29:59.409 --> 00:30:02.150]  You're unbelievable, you scum.
[00:30:02.150 --> 00:30:05.551]  I don't know if the editor wouldn't let them do it, or I don't know if it's the writers that are scum.
[00:30:05.551 --> 00:30:08.172]  The Browns have been aware of increased police activity all morning.
[00:30:08.172 --> 00:30:19.695]  In an audio file posted on a blog this morning, he said a silent aircraft at about 50,000 feet in the air flew over his home overnight.
[00:30:19.695 --> 00:30:21.655]  And he said at about 7.45 a.m.
[00:30:21.655 --> 00:30:25.016]  this morning, a visiting friend
[00:30:25.737 --> 00:30:27.877]  Took a dog out for a walk, but never returned.
[00:30:27.877 --> 00:30:29.458]  They may just be listening to the show.
[00:30:29.458 --> 00:30:32.378]  The dog, he said, came running up the driveway about an hour later.
[00:30:32.378 --> 00:30:42.020]  He also said a neighbor called 845 to let him know that two and one-half dozen state troopers were coming down Route 12A, heading in his direction.
[00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:43.901]  Hmm, interesting that fellow slipped off.
[00:30:43.901 --> 00:30:46.281]  Did they grab him, or did he know when to go?
[00:30:46.281 --> 00:30:46.701]  Who knows?
[00:30:46.701 --> 00:30:47.821]  We'll find out later.
[00:30:47.821 --> 00:30:50.542]  But Browns were convicted in January in U.S.
[00:30:50.542 --> 00:30:53.803]  District Court in Concord for not paying more than $500,000 in taxes.
[00:30:56.224 --> 00:30:59.066]  Do you remember how there was the B.A.T.F.?
[00:30:59.066 --> 00:30:59.567]  I've met him.
[00:30:59.567 --> 00:30:59.847]  I know him.
[00:30:59.847 --> 00:31:00.267]  I forget his name.
[00:31:00.267 --> 00:31:01.488]  Hispanic officer.
[00:31:01.488 --> 00:31:03.290]  He was crying, saying, why'd you kill everybody?
[00:31:03.290 --> 00:31:04.791]  Why'd you open fire?
[00:31:04.791 --> 00:31:08.654]  He came out mad, throwing fits, you know, when they went ahead and just opened fire and attacked.
[00:31:08.654 --> 00:31:09.635]  He was saying, why, why?
[00:31:09.635 --> 00:31:12.097]  He could have picked Koresh up in town.
[00:31:12.097 --> 00:31:13.758]  Remember that?
[00:31:13.758 --> 00:31:14.659]  Now, maybe they grabbed this guy.
[00:31:14.659 --> 00:31:17.341]  He's probably a great guy, but we have to ask ourselves, why did he slip off?
[00:31:17.341 --> 00:31:18.542]  We, you know, have to ask that.
[00:31:18.542 --> 00:31:19.382]  It's a classic M.O.
[00:31:19.382 --> 00:31:19.462]  to...
[00:31:22.549 --> 00:31:24.191]  The Browns were convicted in January in U.S.
[00:31:24.191 --> 00:31:26.193]  District Court and conquered a not-paying $500,000.
[00:31:26.193 --> 00:31:32.079]  The union leader correspondent was kept away from the Browns' compound by state police, who would not say why.
[00:31:32.079 --> 00:31:33.600]  That is confirmed.
[00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:34.061]  That's it.
[00:31:34.061 --> 00:31:35.502]  It's what we were asking for.
[00:31:35.502 --> 00:31:37.844]  Reporters went out there and were kept away.
[00:31:37.844 --> 00:31:38.545]  Boom!
[00:31:38.545 --> 00:31:39.286]  It's on!
[00:31:39.286 --> 00:31:39.966]  Period!
[00:31:39.966 --> 00:31:42.349]  God knows what these criminals have done.
[00:31:42.349 --> 00:31:45.412]  God knows what they've done to these people.
[00:31:47.290 --> 00:31:49.372]  It's on with that line.
[00:31:49.372 --> 00:31:51.133]  You can bank it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:31:51.133 --> 00:31:55.456]  The state police kept Pat Grossmith and Kristen Sins away.
[00:31:55.456 --> 00:31:57.978]  This is outrageous.
[00:31:57.978 --> 00:31:59.219]  That's it.
[00:31:59.219 --> 00:32:04.123]  They are definitely surrounded at the bare minimum.

[00:32:31.428 --> 00:32:35.929]  Cysts, parasites and harmful or unwanted chemicals to below detectable levels.

[00:32:46.851 --> 00:32:52.572]  The Berkey Light is so powerful it can purify raw untreated water from remote lake streams and stagnant ponds.
[00:32:52.572 --> 00:32:58.913]  The Berkey Light is transparent and glows in the dark with its rechargeable LED lighting system so it can be used as a night light or

[00:33:19.394 --> 00:33:22.177]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.

[00:33:36.693 --> 00:33:40.876]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:40.876 --> 00:33:50.944]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:33:50.944 --> 00:33:56.449]  The best way to find Ed and Elaine Brown's blog is just type in Quest for a Fair Trial.
[00:33:57.734 --> 00:34:00.477]  That's why the media won't link to it.
[00:34:00.477 --> 00:34:03.600]  And you can find out all the basics there.
[00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:05.962]  Quest for a Fair Trial.
[00:34:05.962 --> 00:34:06.683]  Ed and Elaine Brown.
[00:34:06.683 --> 00:34:07.224]  It'll come up.
[00:34:07.224 --> 00:34:08.305]  We'll get all the links up.
[00:34:08.305 --> 00:34:09.206]  They're already going up.
[00:34:09.206 --> 00:34:11.688]  All the latest at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:34:11.688 --> 00:34:20.437]  For those that don't know, Pat Grossmuth and Kristen Sins have reported for the union leader at a playing field in New Hampshire,
[00:34:21.215 --> 00:34:24.796]  That the State Police turned them back.
[00:34:24.796 --> 00:34:28.637]  Union Leader Correspondent was kept away from the Browns' compound, their house.
[00:34:28.637 --> 00:34:29.637]  It's always called a compound.
[00:34:29.637 --> 00:34:31.278]  See, they don't want to say home.
[00:34:31.278 --> 00:34:34.038]  This is all psychological warfare.
[00:34:34.038 --> 00:34:34.598]  Okay?
[00:34:34.598 --> 00:34:35.419]  They don't want to say home.
[00:34:35.419 --> 00:34:38.720]  They've got to dehumanize that because you'll associate with your home.
[00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:40.500]  See the enemy's crafting.
[00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:47.285]  A union leader correspondent was kept away from the Browns compound.
[00:34:47.285 --> 00:34:49.949]  See, when they come to kill you, your house is called a compound.
[00:34:49.949 --> 00:34:56.757]  I've heard them called apartments compounds by state police, really federal police, they don't know it, who would not say why.
[00:34:56.757 --> 00:34:57.659]  Well, we know why.
[00:34:57.659 --> 00:34:59.461]  They're going to have a big party.
[00:34:59.461 --> 00:35:00.182]  A killing party.
[00:35:00.888 --> 00:35:05.592]  Let's pray for the Browns right now, folks, if they haven't already been engaged by the New World Order forces.
[00:35:05.592 --> 00:35:18.023]  Susan Williams, who lives a mile or so away from the Browns, on Center of Town Road, said she saw police officers, SWAT team members, a firetruck, ambulance, helicopter, and at least one armored vehicle assembled in a field across from her driveway.
[00:35:18.023 --> 00:35:20.225]  We confirmed that an hour ago.
[00:35:20.225 --> 00:35:24.488]  Now we are confirming that they have been turned away.
[00:35:24.488 --> 00:35:26.510]  They are bare minimum surrounded.
[00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:28.991]  Okay.
[00:35:28.991 --> 00:35:32.593]  And, again, what do you type into Google to find the blog?
[00:35:32.593 --> 00:35:37.976]  The easiest, I've got their blog here in front of me, but what's the best web search for people?
[00:35:37.976 --> 00:35:40.038]  Fred Smart, Friends of the Browns?
[00:35:40.038 --> 00:35:44.380]  Actually, Alex, there's another site that a friend just typed in.
[00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:48.343]  They have a live video feed on everything going on there.
[00:35:48.343 --> 00:35:52.726]  If you'll just take patience here, it's Topix.net.
[00:36:00.709 --> 00:36:01.309]  Don't give it out.
[00:36:01.309 --> 00:36:02.110]  Don't give it out.
[00:36:02.110 --> 00:36:03.011]  You know why?
[00:36:03.011 --> 00:36:05.214]  Because we need to get this feed.
[00:36:05.214 --> 00:36:06.555]  Guys, get a video camera.
[00:36:06.555 --> 00:36:08.297]  We don't have the coupling software.
[00:36:08.297 --> 00:36:09.018]  Go to this site.
[00:36:09.018 --> 00:36:09.879]  I'm going to get it off there.
[00:36:09.879 --> 00:36:11.060]  Folks, don't search it.
[00:36:11.060 --> 00:36:12.281]  Don't find it yet.
[00:36:12.281 --> 00:36:13.523]  If everybody goes to it,
[00:36:14.196 --> 00:36:23.509]  It will crash it just like the feed from New Hampshire with the debates.
[00:36:23.509 --> 00:36:24.110]  I'm telling you.
[00:36:24.110 --> 00:36:29.798]  That's why I didn't even want to plug it when Luke did the other day because I knew it would crash it because they were using a free service.
[00:36:30.639 --> 00:36:31.840]  Don't give it out.
[00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:39.046]  And again, I'm doing this because if we give it out, literally 100,000 people are going to go on it right now.
[00:36:39.046 --> 00:36:41.948]  It'll crash and we'll lose the feed.
[00:36:41.948 --> 00:36:45.111]  I should have got on infrastructure and bought them a server or something.
[00:36:45.111 --> 00:36:46.672]  I can't do it all.
[00:36:46.672 --> 00:36:48.073]  Let me get my guys in here right now.
[00:36:48.073 --> 00:36:49.314]  I'm going to put you on hold.
[00:36:49.314 --> 00:36:55.119]  Give the address right now to John Harmon and he's going to IM it over to my crew here.
[00:36:57.374 --> 00:36:59.196]  They're listening a minute late on the internet.
[00:36:59.196 --> 00:37:00.016]  Hey guys!
[00:37:00.016 --> 00:37:00.777]  Let me bang on the wall.
[00:37:00.777 --> 00:37:02.698]  I need an intercom in here.
[00:37:02.698 --> 00:37:03.519]  We've said that over and over.
[00:37:03.519 --> 00:37:04.259]  We haven't done it.
[00:37:04.259 --> 00:37:14.006]  I need you guys to get in here and get a video camera on the feed so we can at least document that and then we can try to rig it up for some type of live stream here off of our servers.
[00:37:14.006 --> 00:37:17.969]  I've been trying to get three more big servers because I know this kind of stuff's coming up.
[00:37:17.969 --> 00:37:19.290]  But we've got servers right now.
[00:37:19.290 --> 00:37:21.431]  We've got some backup servers.
[00:37:21.431 --> 00:37:23.633]  I need my IT people to get in here now
[00:37:25.342 --> 00:37:28.143]  We're not busy doing other stuff, and we need to get all this rigged up.
[00:37:28.143 --> 00:37:31.044]  We should have had this rigged up before.
[00:37:31.044 --> 00:37:32.085]  Or, you know what?
[00:37:32.085 --> 00:37:33.865]  I guess I'll just give their address out.
[00:37:33.865 --> 00:37:37.907]  Folks, should I give the address out and end the link where we don't know what's happening?
[00:37:37.907 --> 00:37:40.008]  Or do you want us to have the link?
[00:37:40.008 --> 00:37:42.008]  Now everybody's going to spread it all over the web already.
[00:37:42.008 --> 00:37:43.469]  It's over.
[00:37:43.469 --> 00:37:45.089]  Okay, let me just stop there.
[00:37:45.089 --> 00:37:46.430]  When we come back, we will ask
[00:37:47.567 --> 00:37:49.590]  What we're seeing off the live feed.
[00:37:49.590 --> 00:37:52.893]  It looks like, thank God, they haven't moved in yet.
[00:37:52.893 --> 00:37:56.457]  And we will try to find out what's happening there.
[00:37:56.457 --> 00:37:57.358]  This is huge.
[00:37:57.358 --> 00:38:00.682]  This is all happening right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:38:00.682 --> 00:38:03.465]  Edna Lane Brown, falsely charged.
[00:38:03.465 --> 00:38:06.368]  Robbed by the private Federal Reserve's collection agency.
[00:38:06.368 --> 00:38:08.050]  Gone through living hell.
[00:38:08.050 --> 00:38:09.091]  Now facing this.
[00:38:10.066 --> 00:38:13.452]  I'm Alex Jones and we'll be right back on the other side.
[00:38:13.452 --> 00:38:16.056]  We're going to try to rig something up as best we can.
[00:38:16.056 --> 00:38:21.245]  I don't know if we have the skills to try to get a jump feed off this and re-up it.
[00:38:27.438 --> 00:38:28.119]  It's here.
[00:38:28.119 --> 00:38:33.268]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:38:33.268 --> 00:38:40.921]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:38:41.610 --> 00:38:49.054]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:38:49.054 --> 00:39:00.799]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:39:00.799 --> 00:39:04.761]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:39:04.761 --> 00:39:07.022]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:39:07.022 --> 00:39:10.864]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:39:24.619 --> 00:39:28.243]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[00:39:28.243 --> 00:39:28.944]  are located?
[00:39:28.944 --> 00:39:32.568]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?

[00:39:44.482 --> 00:39:44.942]  I think so.
[00:40:03.775 --> 00:40:08.717]  The ideal location for cabins and vacation homes, as well as safe and unsafe areas.

[00:40:26.083 --> 00:40:31.145]  I need to get my feet in shape for summer, but every time I get a pedicure my feet look great.
[00:40:31.937 --> 00:40:33.578]  For a while, anyway.
[00:40:33.578 --> 00:40:37.361]  Then I have to go right back again because they get dry so quickly.
[00:40:37.361 --> 00:40:40.002]  Listen, haven't you heard about CalX ointment?
[00:40:40.002 --> 00:40:43.865]  I use it regularly on my heels and they stay looking great.
[00:40:43.865 --> 00:40:46.667]  And my feet feel as good as they look.
[00:40:46.667 --> 00:40:47.767]  What's the name again?
[00:40:47.767 --> 00:40:49.168]  Wait, I'm getting my pen out.
[00:40:49.168 --> 00:40:50.329]  It's CalX.
[00:40:50.329 --> 00:40:51.289]  C-A-L-L-E-X.
[00:40:52.831 --> 00:40:54.712]  What makes Cal-X ointment so different?
[00:40:54.712 --> 00:41:04.055]  It's got these natural enzymes that quickly exfoliate dry, cracked feet and leave your feet feeling soft and smooth, just like a baby's bottom.
[00:41:04.055 --> 00:41:08.837]  For soft, silky feet that look great in sandals, use enzyme-rich, moisturizing Cal-X ointment.
[00:41:08.837 --> 00:41:18.661]  It's diabetic-friendly and found in the foot care section of Walgreens, Long's, Snyder's Drug, Bilo, Car Drug, H-E-B grocery stores, medicine shop pharmacies, and Rite Aid.
[00:41:18.661 --> 00:41:19.821]  Hey, there's a drug store!
[00:41:19.821 --> 00:41:20.742]  I'll be right back.
[00:41:20.742 --> 00:41:21.682]  I'm getting some Cal-X.
[00:41:29.085 --> 00:41:33.926]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:41:33.926 --> 00:41:35.507]  You want answers?
[00:41:35.507 --> 00:41:36.407]  Well, so does he.
[00:41:36.407 --> 00:41:41.248]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:41:41.248 --> 00:41:46.489]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:41:46.489 --> 00:41:50.751]  Alright, we have the web address of the live webcam.
[00:41:50.751 --> 00:41:52.311]  And it's working well, I'm told.
[00:41:53.206 --> 00:42:01.568]  But if we give it out on air, or if you spread it all over the web thinking it's your little secret, you give it to one person, they give it to another, it will go down.
[00:42:01.568 --> 00:42:03.588]  Do not watch it!
[00:42:03.588 --> 00:42:04.508]  Okay?
[00:42:04.508 --> 00:42:12.269]  Or if we've got IT people that know how to grab the signal, that's the only way you should be looking at it, to grab it and put it out on your server or boost it.
[00:42:12.269 --> 00:42:20.651]  But if we go after that source, I guarantee you, everybody uses these free services and you get more than a hundred people on those webcams, they go down.
[00:42:21.593 --> 00:42:27.316]  They had one that could take, what was it, a couple thousand for the RNC.
[00:42:27.316 --> 00:42:30.658]  You probably got 10 seconds out of every 30 seconds.
[00:42:30.658 --> 00:42:31.959]  We need this.
[00:42:31.959 --> 00:42:34.320]  Imagine at Waco if they would have had that.
[00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:36.602]  And now we've got the responsibility.
[00:42:36.602 --> 00:42:39.443]  When something like this happens, we can't go look at it.
[00:42:39.443 --> 00:42:40.684]  Now I've got cameras set up.
[00:42:40.684 --> 00:42:43.285]  They're in there starting to videotape it right now.
[00:42:43.285 --> 00:42:45.787]  But we can go to Fred Smart.
[00:42:46.684 --> 00:42:48.205]  Who's there watching the video blog?
[00:42:48.205 --> 00:42:49.485]  I'm going to shut up, Fred.
[00:42:49.485 --> 00:42:54.267]  Tell me what you're seeing, what's happening right now on the video cam feed.
[00:42:54.267 --> 00:42:55.007]  They are smart.
[00:42:55.007 --> 00:42:58.108]  They're in there with some type of wireless shell phone.
[00:42:58.108 --> 00:43:01.070]  Now, the feds will learn of this and start jamming it, too.
[00:43:01.070 --> 00:43:03.931]  So it's also a catch-24 that we announce that, but whatever.
[00:43:03.931 --> 00:43:04.431]  It's war.
[00:43:04.431 --> 00:43:06.432]  We're not going to get it all right.
[00:43:06.432 --> 00:43:08.612]  I caught myself before we gave the address out, though.
[00:43:08.612 --> 00:43:10.053]  Tell us right now, what are you seeing?
[00:43:10.513 --> 00:43:16.216]  Yeah, Tim, my internet's down, Alex, for some reason, so Tim... Oh, so that was Tim I was talking to.
[00:43:16.216 --> 00:43:17.437]  I heard Tim in the background was watching.
[00:43:17.437 --> 00:43:18.317]  Yeah, go ahead, Tim.
[00:43:18.317 --> 00:43:19.198]  Are you looking at it?
[00:43:19.198 --> 00:43:20.579]  Tim, Tim, what are you watching?
[00:43:20.579 --> 00:43:25.221]  Well, actually, actually, and I've tried to explain it several times.
[00:43:25.221 --> 00:43:30.904]  What this is is the actual news feed for the Plainfield Wire.
[00:43:30.904 --> 00:43:35.187]  And I just emailed the link to Aaron for him to look at.
[00:43:35.187 --> 00:43:38.989]  This is the comprehensive news feed for Plainfield, New Hampshire.
[00:43:39.620 --> 00:43:41.461]  It has three stories now up.
[00:43:41.461 --> 00:43:44.041]  The latest one was about four minutes ago.
[00:43:44.041 --> 00:43:46.322]  It's about Swat Team's armored vehicle.
[00:43:46.322 --> 00:43:49.303]  I totally misunderstood in all the chat.
[00:43:49.303 --> 00:43:51.224]  I thought it was a live webcam.
[00:43:51.224 --> 00:43:52.964]  Well, somebody said live webcam.
[00:43:52.964 --> 00:43:57.025]  Alex, it's not a live news feed.
[00:43:57.025 --> 00:43:59.586]  It is a recording of their broadcast.
[00:43:59.586 --> 00:44:00.066]  I understand.
[00:44:00.066 --> 00:44:00.606]  Thank you.
[00:44:00.606 --> 00:44:01.207]  I understand now.
[00:44:01.207 --> 00:44:04.888]  I was told earlier by the other person it was a live feed out of there.
[00:44:04.888 --> 00:44:05.488]  I misunderstood.
[00:44:06.655 --> 00:44:08.156]  Okay, okay.
[00:44:08.156 --> 00:44:09.137]  I'm sorry Alex.
[00:44:09.137 --> 00:44:11.178]  Hey, this isn't about sorry and anything.
[00:44:11.178 --> 00:44:13.739]  We're all frothing here because we don't want him to get killed.
[00:44:13.739 --> 00:44:22.723]  And I guess I was hoping that I heard somebody say live webcam out of there and I hoped, oh great, they're not dead, there's a live webcam.
[00:44:22.723 --> 00:44:29.827]  I'm just hoping here and that's what we do when we care about people and don't want fellow patriots to be overrun by a bunch of criminals.
[00:44:29.827 --> 00:44:31.568]  But thank you sir for that information.
[00:44:31.568 --> 00:44:32.749]  Who else are we talking to there?
[00:44:32.749 --> 00:44:33.589]  Who is that Mr. Smart?
[00:44:34.683 --> 00:44:36.645]  Tim from Chicago.
[00:44:36.645 --> 00:44:39.026]  Okay, so we had Tim on earlier.
[00:44:39.026 --> 00:44:40.687]  Okay, Tim, you got the floor.
[00:44:40.687 --> 00:44:41.808]  What do you think's going on here?
[00:44:41.808 --> 00:44:43.890]  What do you think we should do?
[00:44:43.890 --> 00:44:58.960]  Well, I co-hosted with Fred and Elaine on their program, and they were talking yesterday when we were on air, they were talking about these various things that we've already spoken about happening.
[00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:00.201]  It's obviously
[00:45:01.542 --> 00:45:02.103]  No, no.
[00:45:15.049 --> 00:45:25.940]  So, since they're doing the perimeter, it looks like they want to have a big national spectacle.
[00:45:25.940 --> 00:45:29.264]  Maybe they want patriots to start the war now.
[00:45:29.264 --> 00:45:32.007]  Maybe this is how Bush wants to trigger his martial law.
[00:45:35.405 --> 00:45:38.887]  Military Commissions Act.
[00:45:38.887 --> 00:45:40.608]  Military Commissions Act.
[00:45:40.608 --> 00:45:44.191]  This is exactly what they said for insurrection or resistance.
[00:45:44.191 --> 00:45:51.335]  It's all in the subsections and the fact that they didn't do just a quickness.
[00:45:51.335 --> 00:45:56.379]  You know, Alex, at a certain point, at what point is the line crossed?
[00:45:56.379 --> 00:45:59.781]  You know, as Patriots, we've always been drawing lines in the sand.
[00:45:59.781 --> 00:46:02.963]  And I've said for years, we need to have a line in the concrete.
[00:46:03.928 --> 00:46:10.194]  Instead of in the stand, because the stand keeps getting erased, and we step back another, we draw another line, we step back, we draw another line.
[00:46:10.194 --> 00:46:11.815]  Where does the line get drawn?
[00:46:11.815 --> 00:46:12.756]  You yourself said it.
[00:46:12.756 --> 00:46:16.239]  Maybe this is the Alamo, for our generation.
[00:46:16.239 --> 00:46:17.260]  We don't know.
[00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:24.787]  But the fact is, the feds are always pushing, pushing, pushing, and we're always retreating, retreating, retreating.
[00:46:24.787 --> 00:46:28.671]  If it's the time to make the stand, then it is time to make the stand.
[00:46:30.077 --> 00:46:36.704]  And people are going to have to decide on which side they want to be, just like when the Declaration of Independence was signed.
[00:46:36.704 --> 00:46:37.985]  Which side are you going to be on?
[00:46:37.985 --> 00:46:44.132]  Are you going to be for liberty and freedom, or are you going to be on the side of the oppressive super state?
[00:46:44.132 --> 00:46:45.053]  Well, there's no doubt.
[00:46:45.053 --> 00:46:47.135]  I mean, when I state the question,
[00:46:48.186 --> 00:46:53.488]  We're here to analyze and flesh this out and look at every angle of it.
[00:46:53.488 --> 00:46:59.171]  I'm making the statement, are the Feds trying to start and incite a fight?
[00:46:59.171 --> 00:47:04.193]  They know people have said they're going to get violent if Ed and Elaine Brown are killed or assaulted.
[00:47:04.193 --> 00:47:06.674]  So my question is, why would the Feds then
[00:47:08.013 --> 00:47:14.995]  Want to incite this and want to activate this now on this bizarre date of the start of the Six-Day War.
[00:47:14.995 --> 00:47:16.116]  I think that is an interesting point.
[00:47:16.116 --> 00:47:21.257]  Well, it's real simple because, I mean, if you strategize the whole thing out, what if it doesn't do this?
[00:47:21.257 --> 00:47:26.319]  And then people individually start to take out federal officials around the country.
[00:47:26.969 --> 00:47:36.135]  Okay, they're going to declare martial law, and then underneath that, they're going to do house-to-house searches for weaponry.
[00:47:36.135 --> 00:47:47.902]  Which is exactly what Bush has gotten all set up and declared himself dictator back on the 9th of last month, and they funded it, they got it all set up, and this is exactly what they want.
[00:47:47.902 --> 00:47:54.766]  But the bottom line is, I want the police and military to know, you're set up, if this does activate, if this powder keg gets set off,
[00:47:55.246 --> 00:47:56.987]  You are meant to be wiped out.
[00:47:56.987 --> 00:48:04.732]  We've seen the globalist plans, we've gotten all the pieces, to later bring in the Mexican and Dutch and Czech Republic troops.
[00:48:04.732 --> 00:48:09.836]  Those are public plans, mainstream news, to quote deal with American terrorists.
[00:48:09.836 --> 00:48:17.161]  You are just as hated as we are by the New World Order, and I just can't believe they can find goons that will go do these type of criminal actions.
[00:48:17.161 --> 00:48:24.806]  And I mean, from what we're seeing now... Oh, Alex, they've been raising these goons for the last 30 years in the public school.
[00:48:25.876 --> 00:48:39.950]  And creating an economy where people have no choice but to go to work for the army and get trained in whatever the army is training people to do, to think, to follow orders, not to think for themselves.
[00:48:39.950 --> 00:48:41.812]  That's exactly what's been going on.
[00:48:41.812 --> 00:48:44.295]  So it's no problem them getting the manpower.
[00:48:44.295 --> 00:48:46.197]  The problem is, or the question is,
[00:48:46.954 --> 00:48:49.917]  Is this a workable strategy on their behalf?
[00:48:49.917 --> 00:48:51.379]  And I say no.
[00:48:51.379 --> 00:49:04.453]  I say that just like in Iraq, getting brought down in an insurgency, if they were to create that situation here in this country right now, we've got two million firearms in the hands of the people.
[00:49:07.461 --> 00:49:13.185]  Sir, there's 400 million firearms of new manufacture, that means the last 85 years.
[00:49:13.185 --> 00:49:16.347]  There's 160 million gun owners and if 1% is willing to fight, that's 1,600,000 American combatants against the New World Order terror forces.
[00:49:29.984 --> 00:49:31.505]  Alex, you win on the math.
[00:49:31.505 --> 00:49:32.145]  That's fine.
[00:49:32.145 --> 00:49:33.226]  However many.
[00:49:33.226 --> 00:49:34.106]  It's the strategy.
[00:49:34.106 --> 00:49:37.908]  If they really think that... Well, here's the point.
[00:49:37.908 --> 00:49:39.189]  I wasn't trying to win on math.
[00:49:39.189 --> 00:49:41.050]  Listen, we've got to go to break here in just a moment.
[00:49:41.050 --> 00:49:42.531]  Sir, I want to put you on hold.
[00:49:42.531 --> 00:49:45.792]  I want to go back and restate all this stuff.
[00:49:45.792 --> 00:49:48.514]  Because it's... This is all very serious.
[00:49:48.514 --> 00:49:49.794]  This is about Ed and Elaine Brown.
[00:49:49.794 --> 00:49:53.336]  Let me just re-announce this news for everybody out there.
[00:49:53.336 --> 00:49:56.538]  Police assembled by Brown's home.
[00:49:56.538 --> 00:49:58.739]  It has been confirmed by the union leader.
[00:49:59.540 --> 00:50:00.842]  And it looks like they can handle the bandwidth.
[00:50:00.842 --> 00:50:03.446]  Go up there, John, and grab all those audio files, please.
[00:50:03.446 --> 00:50:07.772]  And we're also going to air a Fox News piece that we got about 20 minutes ago coming up in the next segment.
[00:50:07.772 --> 00:50:10.016]  I appreciate both of our guests that are friends with Ed Brown.
[00:50:10.908 --> 00:50:11.588]  I don't know.
[00:50:32.705 --> 00:50:43.449]  The Union Leader clips we're getting and we're asking people to go there and try to observe what's happening and to see specifically what type of military forces, that's what this all is.
[00:50:43.449 --> 00:50:47.670]  It's military, trained police and forces arrayed against the people.
[00:50:47.670 --> 00:50:52.092]  And you notice the Revolutionary War started in New Hampshire.
[00:50:52.092 --> 00:50:58.454]  It started in New Hampshire, ladies and gentlemen, and in Massachusetts.
[00:50:58.454 --> 00:51:00.815]  So this is just classic
[00:51:01.861 --> 00:51:07.504]  New world order, launching their attack, and they know this has been a big national issue.
[00:51:07.504 --> 00:51:10.086]  They've waited six plus months to do this.
[00:51:10.086 --> 00:51:12.267]  They have, uh, this is terrible.
[00:51:12.267 --> 00:51:18.590]  Union leader correspondent was kept away from the Browns compound by state police, who would not say why.
[00:51:18.590 --> 00:51:19.931]  That is confirmed.
[00:51:19.931 --> 00:51:22.752]  Susan Williams, who lives a mile or so away from the Browns.
[00:51:22.752 --> 00:51:24.753]  Let's try to get her on the horn.
[00:51:24.753 --> 00:51:30.357]  Call information for Susan Williams, uh, John, I know you're doing ten things, and, uh, in, uh, Plainfield.
[00:51:30.357 --> 00:51:31.057]  Let's try to get her on.
[00:51:32.216 --> 00:51:50.562]  Susan Williams, who lives a mile or so away from the Browns, on Center of Town Road, said she saw police officers, SWAT team members, and firetruck, ambulance, helicopter, and at least one armored vehicle assembled in a field across from her driveway at the Browns' home.
[00:51:50.562 --> 00:51:58.145]  The Browns answered a telephone call from the Associated Press saying, this is the Lord's House, this is Sister Elaine and Brother Edward.
[00:52:01.494 --> 00:52:05.977]  They said nothing was out of the ordinary at the house.
[00:52:05.977 --> 00:52:08.519]  That, it sounds like the Feds have taken it over.
[00:52:08.519 --> 00:52:11.021]  That sounds like psychological warfare at the Browns' home.
[00:52:11.021 --> 00:52:17.305]  The Browns answered a telephone call from the AP by saying, this is the Lord's house, this is Sister Elaine and Brother Edward.
[00:52:17.305 --> 00:52:19.366]  They don't talk like that.
[00:52:19.366 --> 00:52:21.968]  I know them both, talked to them both, interviewed them both.
[00:52:21.968 --> 00:52:24.270]  That's just pure bull.
[00:52:24.270 --> 00:52:26.191]  I mean, that is, oh, there's nothing wrong here!
[00:52:26.191 --> 00:52:27.092]  Again.
[00:52:28.130 --> 00:52:28.771]  Lying.
[00:52:28.771 --> 00:52:30.453]  Military tactics.
[00:52:30.453 --> 00:52:31.895]  This is horrible, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:52:31.895 --> 00:52:33.437]  Let's pray for them right now.
[00:52:33.437 --> 00:52:35.380]  God, please protect them if that's your will.
[00:52:35.380 --> 00:52:36.901]  Please help them.
[00:52:36.901 --> 00:52:38.483]  Please.
[00:52:38.483 --> 00:52:39.144]  Please.
[00:52:39.144 --> 00:52:39.525]  Please.
[00:52:39.525 --> 00:52:40.286]  This is horrible.
[00:52:44.346 --> 00:52:45.708]  The War on Terrorism.
[00:52:45.708 --> 00:52:48.752]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[00:52:48.752 --> 00:52:53.338]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:52:53.338 --> 00:52:54.480]  So what do you do?
[00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:59.066]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:52:59.526 --> 00:53:02.147]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.

[00:54:18.613 --> 00:54:25.838]  Former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan predicts a recession of alarming magnitude due to increasing budget and trade deficits.
[00:54:25.838 --> 00:54:32.362]  Listen folks, the current economic system is like a game of financial musical chairs.
[00:54:32.362 --> 00:54:33.803]  1-800-606-1294.

[00:54:46.858 --> 00:54:49.881]  Allicin, a natural antibiotic from Allomax Nutraceuticals U.S.
[00:54:49.881 --> 00:54:50.642]  is a real thing.

[00:55:42.296 --> 00:55:47.258]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[00:55:47.258 --> 00:55:50.499]  Soon, it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[00:55:50.499 --> 00:55:53.440]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:58.643]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[00:55:58.643 --> 00:56:04.305]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[00:56:04.305 --> 00:56:07.266]  In 2005, President Bush signed the REAL ID Act.
[00:56:07.466 --> 00:56:08.106]  We're good to go.
[00:56:30.880 --> 00:56:36.083]  For a better understanding of this very important topic and to receive your three free books and a free DVD, call 1-888-211-1715.

[00:56:36.483 --> 00:56:38.284]  No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now.
[00:56:38.284 --> 00:56:40.545]  No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now.
[00:56:59.128 --> 00:56:59.589]  We're good.
[00:57:17.885 --> 00:57:19.587]  Watch out to the Middle Ages.
[00:57:19.587 --> 00:57:21.608]  Planted Earths kept going through changes.
[00:57:21.608 --> 00:57:25.772]  And in the Renaissance came, the times continue to change.
[00:57:25.772 --> 00:57:29.315]  Nothing stayed the same, but they were always renegades.
[00:57:29.315 --> 00:57:34.559]  Like Chief Simba, John Payne, Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, they were renegades.
[00:57:36.127 --> 00:57:37.407]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:57:37.407 --> 00:57:39.388]  Pastor Butch Paw, Genesis Reporter.
[00:57:39.388 --> 00:57:41.268]  Again, none of this is totally confirmed.
[00:57:41.268 --> 00:57:48.210]  We know local news is reporting, WCAX-TV, that they are evacuating homes.
[00:57:48.210 --> 00:57:53.711]  State and federal authorities have converged on the home of a New Hampshire couple involved in an attack standoff.
[00:57:53.711 --> 00:57:57.192]  And there is a man named Drew Raines, who I know has been reporting in the past.
[00:57:57.192 --> 00:57:58.473]  He's reported to Butch in the past.
[00:57:58.473 --> 00:57:59.473]  This is unconfirmed.
[00:58:00.177 --> 00:58:03.864]  We pray this is not the case, but we cannot hold this back from you.
[00:58:03.864 --> 00:58:05.287]  Butch, tell them what the report is.
[00:58:05.287 --> 00:58:07.732]  The report is the House is on fire, Alex.
[00:58:07.732 --> 00:58:08.974]  That's the report I have received.
[00:58:08.974 --> 00:58:09.856]  I cannot confirm it.
[00:58:09.856 --> 00:58:11.800]  That's the report I received that the House is on fire.
[00:58:12.781 --> 00:58:14.743]  I don't know the extent of this.
[00:58:14.743 --> 00:58:17.365]  I'm just so angry now that it's hard to concentrate.
[00:58:17.365 --> 00:58:25.732]  But these people... As a former black ops officer in the army in Vietnam and in other countries, what is it like for you to see your country turn into this?
[00:58:25.732 --> 00:58:37.562]  Well, being an Air Force sergeant, knowing what I did in Vietnam, what I saw over there, and what I thought I was doing was right, this makes me so angry that I don't get to say it very easily.
[00:58:37.562 --> 00:58:39.243]  These people are patriots.
[00:58:39.602 --> 00:58:42.764]  They're fine people standing for the truth, and we're watching them being taken down right now.
[00:58:42.764 --> 00:58:47.606]  If the people do not stand up now, America is damned to hell.
[00:58:47.606 --> 00:58:49.687]  I'm a pastor, I'm saying it as clear as I can say it.
[00:58:49.687 --> 00:58:52.968]  If we do not stand up now, America is damned, and rightfully so.
[00:58:52.968 --> 00:58:58.051]  And so should every person in this nation be damned if we don't stand up right now.
[00:58:58.051 --> 00:58:59.912]  Well, we were talking earlier in the break, and you said it's the same.
[00:58:59.912 --> 00:59:01.412]  Damned if you do, damned if you don't.
[00:59:01.412 --> 00:59:02.533]  Exactly.
[00:59:02.533 --> 00:59:03.513]  It's time to stand.
[00:59:03.513 --> 00:59:05.634]  There is no other time.
[00:59:05.634 --> 00:59:08.916]  We're watching innocent people being taken down one at a time, two or three at a time,
[00:59:12.343 --> 00:59:15.944]  Well now you said live free or die.
[00:59:15.944 --> 00:59:22.768]  You said during the break, and this is the live free or die state, New Hampshire where this is happening, I think they picked it for a reason.
[00:59:22.768 --> 00:59:27.230]  You, during the break I was saying, well don't you think the feds want us?
[00:59:29.571 --> 00:59:34.655]  And the Feds want to start it now because we're growing, we're rising, so we're not getting any stronger.
[00:59:34.655 --> 00:59:38.138]  But I'm not saying people shouldn't really stand up against this.
[00:59:38.138 --> 00:59:42.681]  My only point is that it's clear they're trying to have a provocation.
[00:59:42.681 --> 00:59:45.083]  Of course, and I understand that, and I do understand that.
[00:59:45.083 --> 00:59:50.967]  But we can't let in some people taken out while we're trying to build an army.
[00:59:50.967 --> 00:59:53.889]  If we don't pin the first, we're going to have a hard time pinning the 10th, the 20th, the 30th.
[00:59:54.742 --> 00:59:55.443]  It has to be now.
[00:59:55.443 --> 00:59:56.383]  It can't be longer.
[00:59:56.383 --> 00:59:57.744]  We can't wait any longer in the future.
[00:59:57.744 --> 00:59:58.725]  It must be starting now.
[00:59:58.725 --> 01:00:03.007]  If it's for you being attacked, we'd have to do the same thing for you or for me or anybody else.
[01:00:03.007 --> 01:00:04.128]  We cannot... Well, they're smart.
[01:00:04.128 --> 01:00:05.489]  They go after the little guys first.
[01:00:05.489 --> 01:00:05.929]  Sure.
[01:00:05.929 --> 01:00:06.430]  Absolutely.
[01:00:06.430 --> 01:00:07.690]  And then test.
[01:00:07.690 --> 01:00:10.112]  This is obviously a testing of the waters.
[01:00:10.112 --> 01:00:12.874]  Pastor Butch, I mean, we're here.
[01:00:12.874 --> 01:00:14.395]  We see this going on.
[01:00:14.395 --> 01:00:15.615]  We know they have evacuated.
[01:00:15.615 --> 01:00:16.616]  They're blocking the press.
[01:00:16.616 --> 01:00:18.397]  They say they're moving in now.
[01:00:18.397 --> 01:00:19.998]  That means it was probably an hour ago.
[01:00:19.998 --> 01:00:21.039]  That coincides.
[01:00:21.039 --> 01:00:24.101]  Who is this Drew Rains fella, and what specifically did he tell you?
[01:00:24.361 --> 01:00:36.170]  Well, this was a gentleman called, a call method, Drew Range had called him actually, and Drew Range, I understand, is a reporter, kind of a on-the-scene type guy like you and I. I don't know if he's there right now.
[01:00:36.170 --> 01:00:41.334]  Okay, well we need people to call in because so far the rumor we've been told has turned out to be true.
[01:00:41.334 --> 01:00:43.876]  I pray this one isn't the case.
[01:00:43.876 --> 01:00:46.398]  But let me just read this news article for everybody out there.
[01:00:48.032 --> 01:00:50.455]  Converge on Edna Lane Brown's home.
[01:00:50.455 --> 01:00:55.721]  State and federal authorities have converged on the home of a New Hampshire couple involved in a tax standoff.
[01:00:55.721 --> 01:01:01.507]  People are being kept several miles away from the center town road in Plainfield where Edna Lane Brown lived.
[01:01:02.498 --> 01:01:03.620]  You hear that, ladies and gentlemen?
[01:01:03.620 --> 01:01:05.683]  They are being kept several miles away.
[01:01:05.683 --> 01:01:07.546]  Look, we just need to call all the local reporters.
[01:01:07.546 --> 01:01:08.427]  You call, John.
[01:01:08.427 --> 01:01:09.669]  My people are calling.
[01:01:09.669 --> 01:01:12.273]  Everybody call and ask, is there smoke?
[01:01:12.273 --> 01:01:16.319]  Alex, this is a tactical raid.
[01:01:16.319 --> 01:01:17.501]  The same thing happened in Waco.
[01:01:17.501 --> 01:01:18.322]  The press held back.
[01:01:18.769 --> 01:01:21.230]  The same thing has happened in hundreds of cases.
[01:01:21.230 --> 01:01:22.031]  The press has held back.
[01:01:22.031 --> 01:01:22.711]  And that's what they do.
[01:01:22.711 --> 01:01:25.013]  They don't even want to engage them in a firefight.
[01:01:25.013 --> 01:01:29.295]  They generally do burn people out with incendiary weapons.
[01:01:29.295 --> 01:01:29.955]  It goes on.
[01:01:29.955 --> 01:01:35.178]  It says neighbors, including some who have been evacuated, reported police SWAT teams a helicopter.
[01:01:35.178 --> 01:01:36.159]  They'll use helicopters.
[01:01:36.159 --> 01:01:38.260]  They tried to burn out Ruby Ridge with a helicopter.
[01:01:38.260 --> 01:01:41.142]  And at least one armored vehicle converged on a field near the home.
[01:01:41.922 --> 01:01:47.167]  This morning, authorities have not said if they were moving in to arrest the fugitives.
[01:01:47.167 --> 01:01:48.788]  If they burned them out, my God.
[01:01:48.788 --> 01:01:49.709]  Fugitives?
[01:01:49.709 --> 01:01:51.391]  Fugitives from what?
[01:01:51.391 --> 01:01:53.493]  The Browns have been barricaded.
[01:01:53.493 --> 01:02:00.279]  When CPS tries to take your child, and you don't let them, and you leave out the back door, they announce it's a kidnapping on the news.
[01:02:00.279 --> 01:02:01.880]  99% of the time, I hear an Amber Alert.
[01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:05.583]  It's some parents who the CPS tried to take their child, so they left.
[01:02:05.583 --> 01:02:07.405]  And it's fugitives, fugitives!
[01:02:08.025 --> 01:02:12.867]  The Browns have been barricaded inside their home for several months after being convicted of tax evasion.
[01:02:12.867 --> 01:02:17.929]  They did not even attend their sentencing hearing in which they were sentenced to five years in prison.
[01:02:17.929 --> 01:02:18.730]  You know what?
[01:02:18.730 --> 01:02:29.354]  The tree of liberty is watered by the blood of patriots and tyrants, and I'm telling you, if they burned them out, if they storm troopered them, it's only going to increase the power of the patriot movement.
[01:02:29.354 --> 01:02:30.134]  We'll be right back.
[01:02:30.134 --> 01:02:33.016]  Stay with us.
[01:02:33.016 --> 01:02:34.396]  We're on the march.
[01:02:34.396 --> 01:02:35.897]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:02:36.915 --> 01:02:42.701]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:02:42.701 --> 01:02:45.784]  Are you concerned about the high cost of prescription drugs?

[01:03:39.084 --> 01:03:40.125]  Do it today!
[01:03:40.125 --> 01:03:45.629]  Do you know that you can go solar for under 1,200 bucks now?
[01:03:45.629 --> 01:03:46.950]  Hi, this is Ken Solar.
[01:03:46.950 --> 01:03:51.054]  As you may have heard by now, I've been designing alternative energy packages for over a decade.
[01:03:51.678 --> 01:03:57.083]  The solar power generators I produce will get you all the solar power you need for your household essentials.
[01:03:57.083 --> 01:04:03.489]  Your refrigerator, your freezer, lights, fans, electric blankets, TV, radio, clocks, phones, computers, and a lot more!
[01:04:04.250 --> 01:04:07.112]  No gas, no fumes, and they're totally silent.
[01:04:07.112 --> 01:04:17.358]  Each solar power generator comes complete with everything you'll need, including the solar panel, a 3,000 watt peak inverter, a step-by-step quick setup sheet, and battery backup.
[01:04:17.358 --> 01:04:21.120]  I reached that point in my life where I just didn't want to have to rely on everyone else anymore.
[01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:23.941]  You know, power companies, government.
[01:04:23.941 --> 01:04:27.784]  Anyway, getting yourself free from the utility grid is a lot easier than you might think.
[01:04:27.784 --> 01:04:29.024]  Are you ready to go solar?
[01:04:29.024 --> 01:04:29.985]  Give me a call now at 239-677-3073.
[01:04:33.907 --> 01:04:38.189]  Or order them on my website at a 10% discount on KenSolar.com.
[01:04:38.189 --> 01:04:41.410]  That's KenSolar.com.
[01:04:41.410 --> 01:04:44.531]  Are you lacking energy on a daily basis?
[01:04:44.531 --> 01:04:47.192]  Do you feel tired all the time?
[01:04:48.092 --> 01:04:51.936]  Then it's time for you to try A.C.T., the healthy energy drink.
[01:04:51.936 --> 01:04:52.516]  A.C.T.
[01:04:52.516 --> 01:04:58.201]  helps your body with a natural blend of fruit extracts, herbs, and vitamins to deliver healthy cellular energy.
[01:04:58.201 --> 01:04:58.802]  A.C.T.
[01:04:58.802 --> 01:05:03.386]  contains no caffeine, 4 grams of sugar, and only 22 calories per serving.
[01:05:03.386 --> 01:05:03.926]  A.C.T.
[01:05:03.926 --> 01:05:05.788]  works within minutes, lasts for hours.
[01:05:06.208 --> 01:05:06.889]  I think so.
[01:05:25.891 --> 01:05:26.813]  I think so.
[01:06:04.483 --> 01:06:14.954]  By the way, we're going to be protesting against the New World Order, the North American Union, and for Ed Brown today at 7 o'clock in front of Rick Perry's... In fact, now it's going to be about that.
[01:06:15.709 --> 01:06:16.769]  You say, why in Texas?
[01:06:16.769 --> 01:06:19.470]  Because he's one of the head New World Order minions in the U.S.
[01:06:19.470 --> 01:06:19.690]  now.
[01:06:19.690 --> 01:06:20.930]  He's been to Bilderberg.
[01:06:20.930 --> 01:06:22.531]  It's all part of this great evil.
[01:06:22.531 --> 01:06:23.871]  This is where Waco happened.
[01:06:23.871 --> 01:06:25.452]  No more Wacos.
[01:06:25.452 --> 01:06:27.752]  We're going to have a demonstration tonight at 7 o'clock.
[01:06:27.752 --> 01:06:28.872]  We were going for Bilderberg.
[01:06:28.872 --> 01:06:30.453]  It'll be about that too.
[01:06:30.453 --> 01:06:32.733]  I'm going to be out there at 7 o'clock tonight.
[01:06:32.733 --> 01:06:34.854]  Now, Jack McClam just called us 20 minutes ago.
[01:06:34.854 --> 01:06:38.895]  He was on the phone with the sheriff in the county there.
[01:06:38.895 --> 01:06:40.495]  I'm told he just contacted us.
[01:06:40.495 --> 01:06:41.716]  We're getting him lined up right now.
[01:06:41.716 --> 01:06:42.616]  Do you have Jack McClam yet?
[01:06:44.580 --> 01:06:46.547]  I'm sure 50 million people are calling his number right now.
[01:06:46.547 --> 01:06:47.390]  Do we have Jack?
[01:06:49.389 --> 01:06:50.210]  I need a bigger staff.
[01:06:50.210 --> 01:06:52.131]  My people work so hard and do such a good job.
[01:06:52.131 --> 01:06:52.891]  John's not coming to me.
[01:06:52.891 --> 01:06:54.092]  He must be on the phone.
[01:06:54.092 --> 01:06:56.494]  Let's go back to Pastor Butch Paul.
[01:06:56.494 --> 01:06:58.855]  Butch, I hope you're wrong.
[01:06:58.855 --> 01:07:01.757]  I hope that... I mean, I'm not saying hoping you're wrong.
[01:07:01.757 --> 01:07:04.799]  I hope this report you got is wrong.
[01:07:04.799 --> 01:07:07.040]  But again, we have to report it as it comes in.
[01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:11.203]  It was this unconfirmed report that the house is on fire.
[01:07:11.203 --> 01:07:14.385]  But every other unconfirmed report up to this one has been confirmed.
[01:07:15.380 --> 01:07:17.521]  In my gut, it fits the M.O.
[01:07:17.521 --> 01:07:22.324]  The person leaving in the morning, the drone the night before, and now a fire.
[01:07:22.324 --> 01:07:24.945]  That's what these cowards do as they burn people out.
[01:07:24.945 --> 01:07:26.806]  And they like to shoot them as they run out burning.
[01:07:26.806 --> 01:07:28.467]  It's part of the fun.
[01:07:28.467 --> 01:07:36.571]  And if they burn them out, I just... We need to get, you know, a week or so to have the local grand jury indict these criminals.
[01:07:36.571 --> 01:07:39.592]  But of course, they back everybody off so they can carry out the murder silently.
[01:07:39.592 --> 01:07:43.094]  I'm gonna say this, in any battle... John, are you there?
[01:07:44.494 --> 01:07:44.694]  Okay, good.
[01:07:44.694 --> 01:07:46.735]  I didn't even know because I was calling for Butch and he didn't come back.
[01:07:46.735 --> 01:07:48.956]  Do we have Jack McClam?
[01:07:48.956 --> 01:07:49.336]  Okay, good.
[01:07:49.336 --> 01:07:49.797]  We're getting him on.
[01:07:49.797 --> 01:07:51.457]  We're going to have Butch on with us, too.
[01:07:51.457 --> 01:07:52.458]  I'm going to say this right now.
[01:07:52.458 --> 01:07:54.979]  I'm not afraid to die.
[01:07:54.979 --> 01:07:55.379]  Okay?
[01:07:55.379 --> 01:07:57.820]  And believe me, at my animal level, I like to fight.
[01:07:57.820 --> 01:08:00.742]  I mean, I tear into people all the time.
[01:08:00.742 --> 01:08:03.243]  I mean, I was a maniac growing up, folks.
[01:08:03.243 --> 01:08:07.425]  And frankly, I like fighting two or three people.
[01:08:07.425 --> 01:08:09.526]  I mean, I like having odds down.
[01:08:09.526 --> 01:08:12.567]  It's just I'm an animalistic person.
[01:08:12.567 --> 01:08:13.888]  And I'm not saying I'm a tough guy, either.
[01:08:14.591 --> 01:08:17.253]  No, I've just got a couple screws loose and everybody knows it.
[01:08:17.253 --> 01:08:22.075]  But the point here is, is that, I'm a pretty macho person, okay?
[01:08:22.075 --> 01:08:22.776]  I'll tell you right now.
[01:08:22.776 --> 01:08:28.079]  I mean, people see me run up to 500 Larry Conquistas threatening me and telling me, you know, bring it on.
[01:08:28.079 --> 01:08:37.584]  I mean, I need, but I need, I've learned to control myself because I've had this attitude of let's just go ahead and get it on, okay?
[01:08:37.584 --> 01:08:39.645]  There's nothing I like better, believe me.
[01:08:39.645 --> 01:08:43.347]  But, and I'm going to say this, and I can be the big coward here out in the public and everything.
[01:08:44.171 --> 01:08:57.736]  If they've killed Edna Wayne Brown, or if they've burned them out, or if they've surrounded them, and we know they've surrounded them and they've said they're moving in, and we sit there and let the word of this spread, because that's what happened at Leisington and Concord.
[01:08:57.736 --> 01:09:02.818]  It took, you know, it took weeks for this thing to really get cranking, in the scheme of time.
[01:09:03.890 --> 01:09:11.336]  If we let the news of this get out and how they burned them out or what they truly did, once we find out, that will build our forces even greater.
[01:09:11.336 --> 01:09:20.402]  They are doing this to preemptively try to make us launch military operations against the New World Order, take over the U.S.
[01:09:20.402 --> 01:09:22.384]  because they're losing on the immigration bill.
[01:09:22.384 --> 01:09:26.807]  They're losing on the North American Union and the Pan-American Union through CAFTA.
[01:09:26.807 --> 01:09:29.569]  They are losing on their Second Amendment grabs.
[01:09:29.569 --> 01:09:32.271]  They are losing on every front we are taking over.
[01:09:32.871 --> 01:09:41.338]  Las Vegas odds have gone from 15 to 1, you know, 100 to 1, 15 to 1, to now saying he is the leader, he's the only Republican that can beat the Democrats.
[01:09:41.338 --> 01:09:47.383]  They're now saying that by primary time, this is major, these are the people that are never wrong, folks, I mean, rarely.
[01:09:48.564 --> 01:09:56.535]  They are panicking right now and they want to pick a fight now and chew up all their idiot cops and dumbed down military.
[01:09:56.535 --> 01:09:57.817]  I'm not knocking you.
[01:09:57.817 --> 01:09:58.517]  You're brain dead.
[01:09:58.517 --> 01:09:59.759]  You've been brainwashed.
[01:09:59.759 --> 01:10:01.301]  You've been under major mind control.
[01:10:01.301 --> 01:10:02.583]  We have tried to be your friends.
[01:10:03.664 --> 01:10:05.084]  Jesus, God help me.
[01:10:05.084 --> 01:10:06.745]  I can't believe we're in the middle.
[01:10:06.745 --> 01:10:08.145]  Folks, I know the country.
[01:10:08.145 --> 01:10:12.406]  This isn't people 10 years ago in the Patriot Movement shooting their mouths off about shooting.
[01:10:12.406 --> 01:10:18.807]  Do you realize police and military, there are millions of former special forces and other people who want to start killing you.
[01:10:18.807 --> 01:10:22.988]  Do you fools understand that if it starts, you're going to be dead everywhere.
[01:10:22.988 --> 01:10:27.228]  Within days, you're going to be in armored compounds in citadel fashion.
[01:10:27.228 --> 01:10:30.289]  We will literally kick the living hell out of you.
[01:10:31.198 --> 01:10:33.240]  I don't want this to start.
[01:10:33.240 --> 01:10:33.941]  Okay?
[01:10:33.941 --> 01:10:35.763]  This is about to start.
[01:10:35.763 --> 01:10:36.924]  Do you understand that?
[01:10:36.924 --> 01:10:39.687]  Do you understand people want to come after you?
[01:10:39.687 --> 01:10:42.791]  Do you understand you idiots are being used?
[01:10:42.791 --> 01:10:44.052]  Now I'm just asking people.
[01:10:45.387 --> 01:10:48.869]  Do we need to wait a few days before this stuff kicks off?
[01:10:48.869 --> 01:10:49.930]  I'm calling for calm.
[01:10:49.930 --> 01:10:51.370]  Call me a coward if you want.
[01:10:51.370 --> 01:10:56.913]  Let's bring up Butch Paul, then Jack McClam, who was just... But, I mean, Butch, I'm not trying to be cowardly here.
[01:10:56.913 --> 01:11:02.936]  In fact, I'm afraid right now to even come out here and tell you what I really think, because I'm afraid of people thinking I'm a coward.
[01:11:02.936 --> 01:11:04.157]  That's my only fear.
[01:11:04.157 --> 01:11:06.959]  I'm saying, do we want to give them their war now?
[01:11:06.959 --> 01:11:08.119]  Butch, is that what you're saying?
[01:11:08.119 --> 01:11:14.863]  Well, I'm saying, Alex, that if this were you, or your brother or sister, or your mom or dad, or your children, what would you do?
[01:11:16.053 --> 01:11:22.021]  You know, quite frankly, this is all happening live.
[01:11:22.021 --> 01:11:32.615]  Obviously, I'd want people to rise up for me, but frankly, if I could coldly sit back and know that I was a sacrifice who would literally increase our power a year from now to defeat them, I just want to beat them.
[01:11:32.615 --> 01:11:33.636]  So I'm looking at strategy.
[01:11:34.717 --> 01:11:36.979]  But I know sometimes you can't do strategy.
[01:11:36.979 --> 01:11:39.520]  Forget the maneuvers, go straight at them.
[01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:42.222]  Again, if it's you or I, we wouldn't mind being sacrificed.
[01:11:42.222 --> 01:11:43.103]  Understand that.
[01:11:43.103 --> 01:11:47.366]  But if this were your brother or sister, mom or dad, son or daughter... I couldn't control myself.
[01:11:47.366 --> 01:11:48.086]  No, you could not.
[01:11:48.086 --> 01:11:54.951]  This is somebody's brother or sister, somebody's mom or dad, somebody's whatever, and somebody cares enough.
[01:11:54.951 --> 01:11:59.494]  I don't want to say, Alex, this is another crossroads.
[01:11:59.494 --> 01:12:01.575]  Are we going to... It's a test.
[01:12:01.575 --> 01:12:02.156]  It's a test.
[01:12:02.156 --> 01:12:03.657]  Are we going to fail another one?
[01:12:05.112 --> 01:12:05.532]  Absolutely.
[01:12:05.532 --> 01:12:09.495]  Well, you know, we failed Waco, but then that energized the whole movement today.
[01:12:09.495 --> 01:12:10.435]  It did for a while.
[01:12:10.435 --> 01:12:13.617]  And then they carried out Oklahoma City to try to blame it on us.
[01:12:13.617 --> 01:12:15.318]  But it doesn't work anymore.
[01:12:15.318 --> 01:12:16.979]  Everybody knows they're behind the terror.
[01:12:16.979 --> 01:12:21.122]  It's on the front page of the Jerusalem Post that Israel's staging terror.
[01:12:21.122 --> 01:12:23.423]  Look at this from a pastor's viewpoint, and that's who I am.
[01:12:23.423 --> 01:12:24.004]  I'm a Christian.
[01:12:24.004 --> 01:12:24.904]  I am a Christian.
[01:12:24.904 --> 01:12:27.145]  I'm a non-violent person.
[01:12:27.145 --> 01:12:27.826]  Anyone knows me.
[01:12:27.826 --> 01:12:29.107]  That's my five grandbabies.
[01:12:29.107 --> 01:12:30.988]  I'm a wuss, and they know it.
[01:12:30.988 --> 01:12:32.489]  I'm a non-violent person.
[01:12:32.489 --> 01:12:34.190]  But when someone attacks an innocent person,
[01:12:34.710 --> 01:12:35.590]  No, I haven't got any intel.
[01:12:35.590 --> 01:12:38.751]  I talked to the Sheriff's Office just about a half hour ago when I heard that this was going on.
[01:13:02.962 --> 01:13:05.524]  Uh, the sheriff is conveniently out of town.
[01:13:05.524 --> 01:13:10.206]  Like, that's the same thing they did up at Ruby Ridge.
[01:13:10.206 --> 01:13:16.910]  Same thing at Ruby Ridge, and the sheriff in Waco handed over jurisdiction to the feds.
[01:13:16.910 --> 01:13:22.613]  Only buddy within the office is a gal named Barbara who's the secretary of the sheriff.
[01:13:23.758 --> 01:13:30.246]  And so we didn't do very well and she told me she was going to take her phone off the hook because she can't get her work done.
[01:13:30.246 --> 01:13:31.728]  So she's not concerned at all.
[01:13:31.728 --> 01:13:35.112]  Yeah, she's going to get her work done, eat her sandwich while people die.
[01:13:35.112 --> 01:13:36.013]  Yeah.
[01:13:36.013 --> 01:13:43.262]  So I told her, I told her, I said that we had sent our sheriff's video to the sheriff six months ago or more.
[01:13:44.168 --> 01:13:48.190]  Showing that he is in total control when the feds come into town.
[01:13:48.190 --> 01:13:49.650]  We've got this sheriff's video.
[01:13:49.650 --> 01:13:51.151]  It's an absolute fact.
[01:13:51.151 --> 01:13:55.252]  You know, and showing him what his power and jurisdiction is.
[01:13:55.252 --> 01:14:03.955]  I told her, I said, I just need to get the message to those on the scene that if they turn it over to the feds, people are going to die.
[01:14:03.955 --> 01:14:06.056]  And I said, it doesn't have to be that way.
[01:14:06.056 --> 01:14:09.197]  If the sheriff will stay in control, or his men,
[01:14:10.089 --> 01:14:14.733]  That they can have a peaceful conclusion of this thing.
[01:14:14.733 --> 01:14:16.094]  I'm looking at Ed and Elaine Brown.
[01:14:16.094 --> 01:14:17.034]  They're great people.
[01:14:17.034 --> 01:14:19.536]  They're great people in the live free or die state.
[01:14:19.536 --> 01:14:21.658]  They are literally living that maxim.
[01:14:21.658 --> 01:14:23.940]  I've got to bring up the key point here.
[01:14:23.940 --> 01:14:25.041]  Jack, you know this.
[01:14:25.041 --> 01:14:26.862]  You saw Ruby Ridge with Waco.
[01:14:26.862 --> 01:14:29.344]  You know those are the zeniths of the whole resistance.
[01:14:29.344 --> 01:14:37.410]  If those wouldn't have happened and the feds wouldn't have done that, we wouldn't have the movement today that's defeating the amnesty, defeating the North American Union.
[01:14:37.410 --> 01:14:38.531]  We're having victories.
[01:14:39.191 --> 01:14:43.892]  Strategy-wise, not in a hot-blooded way, and I understand that, but I don't think we can control people.
[01:14:43.892 --> 01:14:46.913]  And the Feds may even stage something and say the Patriots did it.
[01:14:46.913 --> 01:14:47.954]  I mean, that's what they do.
[01:14:47.954 --> 01:14:54.095]  You know, Alex and Jackie, this boils down to something that we need to think about.
[01:14:54.095 --> 01:14:58.977]  The IRS and the federal government obviously doesn't need their pittance, their tax.
[01:14:58.977 --> 01:14:59.837]  That is not the point.
[01:15:00.217 --> 01:15:02.058]  They're losing control, and they know that.
[01:15:02.058 --> 01:15:05.400]  If one person gets by with this, then others will do the same thing.
[01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:07.501]  So they must make an example of Ed and Elaine.
[01:15:07.501 --> 01:15:08.342]  That's what's going on right now.
[01:15:08.342 --> 01:15:12.144]  They're trying to scare the people back in the box, back in the cage.
[01:15:12.144 --> 01:15:13.925]  They don't need the money.
[01:15:13.925 --> 01:15:15.045]  Money's not the issue.
[01:15:15.045 --> 01:15:19.128]  It's a power trip, and they cannot allow us to take a stand.
[01:15:19.128 --> 01:15:24.831]  They'll take us out one at a time, and God forbid this blows into a full-scale revolution.
[01:15:24.831 --> 01:15:27.852]  But if it does, then so be it.
[01:15:27.852 --> 01:15:28.733]  I don't see any...
[01:15:28.973 --> 01:15:36.861]  Well let me get Jack McClam's take on that and then if we still got Fred Smart and Tim or is it Jim who know Ed and have been doing a show with him.
[01:15:36.861 --> 01:15:39.283]  If they're still there I want to go back to them in a moment and keep both you gentlemen on.
[01:15:39.283 --> 01:15:41.225]  We're suspending all other programming now.
[01:15:41.225 --> 01:15:43.767]  I'm even trying to get Ted to suspend some of the ads here.
[01:15:43.767 --> 01:15:44.828]  I'll pay for them, I don't care.
[01:15:47.342 --> 01:15:48.944]  So much is going on.
[01:15:48.944 --> 01:15:50.286]  Jack, I know you're having the same thoughts.
[01:15:50.286 --> 01:15:54.312]  You're a veteran, most highly decorated police officer in Phoenix, Arizona's history.
[01:15:54.312 --> 01:15:58.077]  You've been 27 years police and military against the New World Order.
[01:15:58.077 --> 01:15:59.378]  We knew this was coming.
[01:15:59.378 --> 01:16:01.541]  We're having so many strides peacefully right now.
[01:16:02.142 --> 01:16:02.742]  Well, brother, what I...
[01:16:27.805 --> 01:16:42.537]  What I think it is, and I have agreement with some of my friends in the military and law enforcement, is they're looking for an event to push us into a violent confrontation so they can suspend the First Amendment
[01:16:43.268 --> 01:16:45.390]  And we cannot reach any more people.
[01:16:45.390 --> 01:16:51.855]  This may very well be the event they're pushing to try to get everybody to go there.
[01:16:51.855 --> 01:16:56.159]  And they've been having Fox News TV productions and dramas on NBC.
[01:16:56.159 --> 01:17:04.586]  Every TV show I've seen with dramas, with the cop shows now, is where talk show hosts, and a lot of times they'll even have names like Alex, and they'll be from Texas.
[01:17:04.586 --> 01:17:07.729]  I mean, people joke that it's always an archetype of me.
[01:17:08.209 --> 01:17:14.512]  And then there's a standoff, we report it, it causes a riot, the cops mow everybody down, and then ban free speech.
[01:17:14.512 --> 01:17:15.853]  So you were getting that from intel?
[01:17:15.853 --> 01:17:19.515]  That's what they want to do, because we're winning, brother, we're winning.
[01:17:19.515 --> 01:17:30.681]  And my dear brother there with you, Pastor, you know we're winning, and if they can push us now, right now, into starting the war,
[01:17:31.718 --> 01:17:36.541]  We lose and they win.
[01:17:36.541 --> 01:17:44.725]  If they can't push us into starting a violent revolution at this moment, they lose because we continue to go awaken people.
[01:17:44.725 --> 01:17:50.728]  If they kill that family, then they lose big time if we still have the First Amendment.
[01:17:50.728 --> 01:17:52.789]  If we go to war with them right now,
[01:17:53.433 --> 01:17:58.558]  Then they win because we can't reach any more people and that's exactly what they want to do.
[01:17:58.558 --> 01:18:02.962]  Well, whatever happens, let me just say this and then Butch can jump in.
[01:18:02.962 --> 01:18:07.467]  Whatever happens, it's the Globalist's fault and they caused this and they're a bunch of murdering scum.
[01:18:07.467 --> 01:18:08.047]  Go ahead.
[01:18:08.047 --> 01:18:10.750]  Okay, now my question is this, and I'm not trying to...
[01:18:10.930 --> 01:18:13.692]  I don't want to be a provocateur here by any means.
[01:18:13.692 --> 01:18:20.278]  If we don't do it, if we don't take a stand and say go to war, the feds will do it for us and blame it on us, and that's going to happen.
[01:18:20.278 --> 01:18:21.399]  It's happened before.
[01:18:21.399 --> 01:18:23.100]  It happened in Oklahoma City.
[01:18:23.100 --> 01:18:24.261]  Obviously that happened.
[01:18:24.261 --> 01:18:36.791]  But here's a question, Jack and Alex, I mean this sincerely, this is a sincere question, not a way to cause an argument, but how many innocent lambs do we allow to be slaughtered as a way to further our cause?
[01:18:36.791 --> 01:18:39.033]  I mean, can we justify that before our holy God?
[01:18:40.154 --> 01:18:41.715]  I think we can brother, I think we can.
[01:19:11.715 --> 01:19:19.458]  Well, we win.
[01:19:19.458 --> 01:19:32.283]  If they kill that family, now I'm telling you right now, I'm here at my home, and if I were in that position, I know that if they came in and killed me, that we would win in the freedom movement.
[01:19:32.283 --> 01:19:36.765]  We would win because they wouldn't have pushed us into going to this
[01:19:37.310 --> 01:19:45.393]  Violent confrontation that they want to put us under martial law and end our growth of awakening people.
[01:19:45.393 --> 01:19:47.394]  That is tremendous right now.
[01:19:47.394 --> 01:19:48.415]  It is tremendous.
[01:19:48.415 --> 01:19:50.155]  They're scared to death of it.
[01:19:50.155 --> 01:20:03.401]  They want to shut us down and this could very well be the way they're trying to do it is to get us to respond with our weapons all across the country into that area and we'll be under martial law and there won't be any more people
[01:20:03.911 --> 01:20:12.719]  Brought to the knowledge that the bad guys are actually... And let's be clear, in phase two starts that the police and military haven't been told, even as high as one-star generals.
[01:20:12.719 --> 01:20:15.121]  You are all to be chewed up in the fight with us.
[01:20:15.121 --> 01:20:17.403]  You're going to be completely defeated.
[01:20:17.403 --> 01:20:18.384]  I want them to know this.
[01:20:18.384 --> 01:20:20.666]  There's no doubt we will destroy you.
[01:20:20.666 --> 01:20:22.127]  We will smash you.
[01:20:22.127 --> 01:20:24.929]  We can totally, totally defeat you.
[01:20:24.929 --> 01:20:25.750]  Just obliterate you.
[01:20:27.031 --> 01:20:28.212]  Now, here's the point.
[01:20:28.212 --> 01:20:29.832]  Then they're going to bring in the foreign troops.
[01:20:29.832 --> 01:20:30.793]  And then it's on.
[01:20:30.793 --> 01:20:31.733]  Starvation.
[01:20:31.733 --> 01:20:33.774]  It's going to look like New Orleans nationwide.
[01:20:33.774 --> 01:20:37.276]  And don't you think for a minute the globalists aren't planning it.
[01:20:37.276 --> 01:20:41.258]  Everything they've done is for the moment we have now reached.
[01:20:41.258 --> 01:20:44.740]  We are in the... This is un... I ask God to give us guidance.
[01:20:44.740 --> 01:20:45.821]  This is unbelievable.
[01:20:45.821 --> 01:20:49.122]  I ask this question again, and I totally agree with Jack.
[01:20:49.122 --> 01:20:50.583]  I'm willing to be a sacrificial lamb.
[01:20:50.583 --> 01:20:52.884]  I would be honored to die for the cause.
[01:20:52.884 --> 01:20:53.745]  Right now, if you come at me...
[01:20:54.854 --> 01:20:57.004]  If they would kill me, and it would help...
[01:20:57.639 --> 01:20:58.919]  I think, brother, you know I pray every night
[01:21:27.321 --> 01:21:54.462]  that God stops George Bush and company from doing another false flag operation because if he does that they will convince the American people that it was Iran and we gotta go into Iran and so the same way here I pray and I've already prayed this morning that the people will not go there in mass because that is what this is all about I feel it in my heart they're trying they they know that everybody's been praying for and thinking and
[01:21:54.972 --> 01:22:03.222]  And knowing about Ed Brown this family, and this is the way they hope to push us into the violent revolution.
[01:22:03.954 --> 01:22:07.855]  And end our growth of awakening God's people.
[01:22:07.855 --> 01:22:13.636]  Do you think we can, and again I'm asking a question that's been on my heart for a long time.
[01:22:13.636 --> 01:22:17.757]  I'm 58 years old and I've been preaching for 30 years, so I've been part of this a long time.
[01:22:17.757 --> 01:22:22.259]  Do you think that we're going to win a tyranny by voting or by talking?
[01:22:22.259 --> 01:22:25.199]  The tyrants will not back down, but there won't be a petition in office.
[01:22:25.199 --> 01:22:27.880]  The point is that no one can doubt
[01:22:28.520 --> 01:22:32.623]  That our force is growing and growing and growing and it's important we're having this discussion.
[01:22:32.623 --> 01:22:34.184]  We need to get more information.
[01:22:34.184 --> 01:22:35.925]  We're going to skip this break.
[01:22:35.925 --> 01:22:40.767]  Do we still have the other gentlemen on, Mr. Smart and others?
[01:22:40.767 --> 01:22:46.031]  Gentlemen, I want to let you go, but I'd like you to pop back in here on Genesis as the day unfolds.
[01:22:46.031 --> 01:22:49.192]  I know you've got your own program you've got to do here in a few minutes.
[01:22:49.192 --> 01:22:50.653]  I've got three things to say.
[01:22:50.653 --> 01:22:52.614]  Okay, who is this?
[01:22:52.614 --> 01:22:53.015]  Oh, hi.
[01:22:53.015 --> 01:22:53.935]  This is Tim.
[01:22:53.935 --> 01:22:54.556]  Okay, go ahead, Tim.
[01:22:56.253 --> 01:22:58.434]  I got three things to say, basically, Alex.
[01:22:58.434 --> 01:23:05.517]  One is, uh, nemo me impunis et, which is Latin for, no man injures me with impunity.
[01:23:05.517 --> 01:23:11.720]  When the law no longer works, we go back to the higher law, the older law, and that is the law of revenge.
[01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:12.600]  Law of the jungle!
[01:23:12.600 --> 01:23:15.802]  Michael Collins, Michael Collins gambit.
[01:23:15.802 --> 01:23:19.043]  What we're facing here is something we gotta be smart about.
[01:23:19.043 --> 01:23:23.705]  If, as Jack McSlam said, if they have killed this family and these people,
[01:23:24.113 --> 01:23:30.876]  We cannot do a frontal assault like Amon D. Valera wanted to do back in the early 1920s.
[01:23:30.876 --> 01:23:34.158]  Michael Collins is the one who says, no, you go for the head.
[01:23:34.158 --> 01:23:43.742]  That's when he put the unit together and simply said, you take out the British leaders and you take out the Irish collaborators.
[01:23:43.742 --> 01:23:46.964]  The third thing is leaderless resistance.
[01:23:46.964 --> 01:23:48.845]  Everybody can look it up.
[01:23:48.845 --> 01:23:50.605]  This is something that can't be coordinated.
[01:23:50.605 --> 01:23:51.726]  It has to come out of your heart.
[01:23:52.501 --> 01:23:55.183]  The point is, you cannot have a frontal assault.
[01:23:55.183 --> 01:23:56.364]  It's called total resistance.
[01:23:56.364 --> 01:23:57.285]  Yes.
[01:23:57.285 --> 01:23:59.607]  We cannot have a frontal assault.
[01:23:59.607 --> 01:24:01.468]  It'd be suicide.
[01:24:01.468 --> 01:24:04.671]  No, actually, a frontal assault would win as well, sir.
[01:24:04.671 --> 01:24:06.372]  It's a tidal wave.
[01:24:06.372 --> 01:24:07.493]  They're a bunch of cowards.
[01:24:07.493 --> 01:24:08.233]  I've seen these guys.
[01:24:08.233 --> 01:24:11.516]  I mean, look at them in Virginia, hiding behind trees.
[01:24:11.516 --> 01:24:14.158]  Listen, I appreciate you.
[01:24:14.158 --> 01:24:15.719]  Let's now go to Mr. Smart.
[01:24:15.719 --> 01:24:18.181]  Mr. Smart, comments?
[01:24:18.181 --> 01:24:18.661]  Yeah, Alex.
[01:24:20.507 --> 01:24:28.534]  Alex, I'm a big fan of just the power of prayer and action in a positive light.
[01:24:28.534 --> 01:24:44.909]  If you get people activated and motivated to get out and walk and run and pray, I don't care if you're praying the rosary, but you're getting outside, a peaceful grouping of tens of thousands, if not millions of people, in and around Plainfield, in and around Lebanon,
[01:24:45.703 --> 01:24:48.105]  Uh, is needed right now.
[01:25:04.074 --> 01:25:06.076]  Don't be cowards.
[01:25:06.076 --> 01:25:08.818]  Drive up to the checkpoint and at least get video of that.
[01:25:08.818 --> 01:25:09.339]  Absolutely.
[01:25:09.339 --> 01:25:11.761]  Show these murderers.
[01:25:11.761 --> 01:25:12.582]  Sacrificial lamb.
[01:25:12.582 --> 01:25:13.122]  Okay.
[01:25:13.122 --> 01:25:16.105]  We'll say this could be another sacrificial lamb to further the cause.
[01:25:16.105 --> 01:25:16.885]  I'm not going to debate that.
[01:25:16.885 --> 01:25:18.147]  That could be what it could be.
[01:25:18.147 --> 01:25:25.253]  But, again, I don't know that I have a right to choose who gets to be the sacrificial lamb and who doesn't.
[01:25:25.253 --> 01:25:26.153]  Well, let's just wait and see.
[01:25:26.153 --> 01:25:27.755]  Let me get a comment from Jack McClam real quick.
[01:25:28.706 --> 01:25:40.775]  Well, I'm a warrior for the Vietnam War, and I worked the war zone in South Phoenix for years, lost seven of my fellow officers down there in South Phoenix.
[01:25:40.775 --> 01:25:42.896]  I would like to go kick butt.
[01:25:42.896 --> 01:25:56.166]  I mean, I would like to go clean house, but I know their plan, and I don't want to be a part of initiating their shutdown of this wonderful awakening going on in America today, and I think that's what this is all about.
[01:25:56.166 --> 01:25:57.607]  So we have to be wise.
[01:25:58.539 --> 01:26:03.061]  We have to think about what their plans are and why they're doing this.
[01:26:03.061 --> 01:26:09.523]  And if our dear brother goes to heaven to be with the Lord and his family, we'll see him again one day.
[01:26:09.523 --> 01:26:17.966]  But I know how I feel that if I could help the Freedom Movement awaken more people with my death, I would do it tomorrow.
[01:26:17.966 --> 01:26:20.267]  I would have them come in and do me tomorrow.
[01:26:20.267 --> 01:26:22.028]  So we have to be wise.
[01:26:22.028 --> 01:26:22.868]  I don't like it.
[01:26:22.868 --> 01:26:25.909]  I would love to go in and just kick butt and take our country back.
[01:26:26.590 --> 01:26:30.451]  But we will have more people next week with us.
[01:26:30.451 --> 01:26:35.873]  If they kill this family in the weeks after, then they won't even imagine.
[01:26:35.873 --> 01:26:41.015]  They're hoping they can get us to do something violent as a group of people around the nation.
[01:26:41.015 --> 01:26:43.436]  So I say that we must pray.
[01:26:43.436 --> 01:26:46.097]  We should go there and pray and hold fast.
[01:26:46.097 --> 01:26:50.258]  And we should all fast and pray to the Lord that the family be protected.
[01:26:50.258 --> 01:26:53.039]  But let God's will be done.
[01:26:53.039 --> 01:26:54.720]  We have to awaken more people.
[01:26:54.720 --> 01:26:55.400]  Our main goal
[01:26:56.477 --> 01:27:03.439]  Is to keep on the First Amendment, allowing us to waken more and more people because it's scaring the tar out of the enemy of God.
[01:27:03.439 --> 01:27:05.219]  I'll say this, I don't just say this for effect.
[01:27:05.219 --> 01:27:05.679]  It's true.
[01:27:05.679 --> 01:27:06.920]  They are imploding.
[01:27:06.920 --> 01:27:07.960]  Everyone's waking up.
[01:27:07.960 --> 01:27:09.781]  They're losing all credibility.
[01:27:09.781 --> 01:27:11.881]  They are in info war retreat.
[01:27:11.881 --> 01:27:12.781]  We are surging.
[01:27:12.781 --> 01:27:15.802]  And I guarantee you, they're probably going to nuke Chicago in the next month.
[01:27:15.802 --> 01:27:19.143]  There's no telling what the glove, I can just tell you right now, everybody feels it.
[01:27:19.543 --> 01:27:24.604]  Everybody knows that it's all coming to a head right now, and I'm talking about the next year.
[01:27:24.604 --> 01:27:27.645]  It's all accelerating, and whatever happens, happens.
[01:27:27.645 --> 01:27:33.806]  But I guarantee you, those dumb cops and those dumb military people have no idea that they're being used right now.
[01:27:33.806 --> 01:27:36.627]  You know, what she has said is very true.
[01:27:36.627 --> 01:27:40.127]  They're going to do something to escape martial law, no matter what it is.
[01:27:40.127 --> 01:27:42.488]  Whether we do it or they do it, they're going to do it.
[01:27:43.308 --> 01:27:45.189]  I don't know when, I don't know how.
[01:27:45.189 --> 01:27:48.851]  And I'm not saying for anybody to go out there and do anything, we'll say violent.
[01:27:48.851 --> 01:27:49.951]  Honestly, I'm not Jack.
[01:27:49.951 --> 01:27:51.812]  I'm saying, but what do we do?
[01:27:51.812 --> 01:27:52.693]  When do we draw the line?
[01:27:52.693 --> 01:27:53.793]  When do we say no more?
[01:27:53.793 --> 01:27:55.614]  It's enough.
[01:27:55.614 --> 01:27:56.114]  Where?
[01:27:56.114 --> 01:28:00.076]  We murder 50 million innocent children in the womb, and don't want to stop that yet.
[01:28:00.076 --> 01:28:04.198]  We let sodomites and lesbians take over the country, and run offices, and control us.
[01:28:04.198 --> 01:28:05.978]  When do we say no more as a people?
[01:28:05.978 --> 01:28:10.601]  How long will it take before we say, we die by the means, or we die one at a time?
[01:28:10.601 --> 01:28:11.461]  What difference does it make?
[01:28:12.199 --> 01:28:22.105]  Well, I've never seen so many police officers and soldiers waking up in my 27 years of doing this work, and I want to see that continue.
[01:28:22.105 --> 01:28:25.007]  More and more police and soldiers wake up.
[01:28:25.007 --> 01:28:40.196]  I just talked to a guy this morning over there on the East Coast that has his sheriff awake now and communicating with us, and brother, if a couple more of our people have to die right now so we can continue this great awakening,
[01:28:41.047 --> 01:28:41.607]  So be it.
[01:28:41.607 --> 01:28:42.587]  That's the way it's got to be.
[01:28:42.587 --> 01:28:44.768]  And that's not the war you're in me speaking.
[01:28:44.768 --> 01:28:48.109]  I want to go kick butt and take these people out.
[01:28:48.109 --> 01:28:50.049]  But you've got to realize, we will kick the butts.
[01:28:50.049 --> 01:28:51.630]  I want to make this point.
[01:28:51.630 --> 01:28:58.251]  We will kick the butt of worthless scum minions in black uniforms that the New World Order wants to die.
[01:28:58.251 --> 01:28:58.911]  Remember that.
[01:28:58.911 --> 01:29:07.293]  What the fellow said earlier, if they start the martial law, the mass roundups, it is the resistance model used against the Germans in Europe.
[01:29:07.293 --> 01:29:09.474]  It is the resistance model used over and over again.
[01:29:09.474 --> 01:29:10.474]  That is the model.
[01:29:11.392 --> 01:29:13.073]  And everybody needs to understand that.
[01:29:13.073 --> 01:29:19.175]  And if you don't know what lone wolf resistance is, you better learn real fast, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:29:19.175 --> 01:29:22.216]  Well, I do know that something's going to give in the very near future.
[01:29:22.216 --> 01:29:23.237]  In my spirit, I sense this.
[01:29:23.237 --> 01:29:24.077]  I know you do, Jack.
[01:29:24.077 --> 01:29:25.157]  I know you do, Alex.
[01:29:25.157 --> 01:29:27.418]  Something is going to break soon.
[01:29:27.418 --> 01:29:28.119]  I don't know when.
[01:29:28.119 --> 01:29:29.239]  I'm not a prophet.
[01:29:29.239 --> 01:29:30.640]  But I'm also not unlearned.
[01:29:30.640 --> 01:29:32.500]  But I do feel it in the spirit.
[01:29:32.500 --> 01:29:33.241]  Everybody feels it.
[01:29:33.241 --> 01:29:34.101]  I can't even sleep now.
[01:29:34.341 --> 01:29:35.482]  No, it's imminent.
[01:29:35.482 --> 01:29:36.442]  It's going to be imminent.
[01:29:36.442 --> 01:29:42.384]  It's just like when I was going to be shelled, when I was in Cameron Bay and Food Cat and other places, when I knew this shelling was imminent.
[01:29:42.384 --> 01:29:45.686]  It's a gut feeling that you know is coming.
[01:29:45.686 --> 01:29:46.286]  Get ready.
[01:29:46.286 --> 01:29:49.788]  Now this may be the key, and this is what I fear.
[01:29:49.788 --> 01:29:50.948]  I mean this sincerely.
[01:29:50.948 --> 01:29:54.750]  If we don't intercede, now I'm not telling Stewart, I'm just making a comment here.
[01:29:54.750 --> 01:29:58.011]  If we don't do it, will the Feds do it and blame it on us anyway?
[01:29:58.712 --> 01:30:00.033]  They're going to have their way.
[01:30:00.033 --> 01:30:01.054]  That's a key point.
[01:30:01.054 --> 01:30:05.818]  I mean, in my life, I have had a feeling right before a car came out of nowhere and hit me in the car.
[01:30:05.818 --> 01:30:08.240]  I've had feelings right before somebody tried to mug me.
[01:30:08.240 --> 01:30:13.925]  And you're saying, and I've talked to a lot of people, that right before you get shelled at random times, you'd know when they were coming before it even started.
[01:30:14.706 --> 01:30:15.947]  And I want to just tell you how bad it's getting.
[01:30:15.947 --> 01:30:18.669]  I put out a monthly news magazine called the Minute Man News.
[01:30:18.669 --> 01:30:26.316]  And I've had two people now, one from Ohio, one from Pennsylvania, call me that were pulled over by cops, saw the magazine on the front seat of the car.
[01:30:26.316 --> 01:30:28.518]  This is the guy's truth I'm telling right now.
[01:30:28.518 --> 01:30:29.699]  I just got one call today.
[01:30:29.699 --> 01:30:30.119]  I understand.
[01:30:30.239 --> 01:30:36.663]  The gentleman in Ohio, they called an FBI, the terrorist task force, to come and arrest him.
[01:30:36.663 --> 01:30:37.903]  That's the truth.
[01:30:37.903 --> 01:30:40.045]  They took me for five hours and interrogated him.
[01:30:40.045 --> 01:30:44.547]  He called a copy of my magazine on the front seat, along with a constitution and a road map.
[01:30:44.547 --> 01:30:45.788]  And they called in Pennsylvania this morning.
[01:30:45.788 --> 01:30:50.190]  The cops said, that magazine is subversive material.
[01:30:50.190 --> 01:30:54.633]  This time next year, he said, this time next year, you'll be arrested for having that magazine in your possession.
[01:30:54.773 --> 01:31:05.939]  Yeah, they're already telling the cops martial law is coming, and it was in AP last week that Christians, it even said gay rights groups, environmental groups, everybody gets arrested.
[01:31:05.939 --> 01:31:06.660]  Good God.
[01:31:06.660 --> 01:31:07.900]  Stay there, Jack McLean.
[01:31:07.900 --> 01:31:08.681]  Stay there, Butch Paul.
[01:31:08.681 --> 01:31:10.082]  I want to hear more about this.
[01:31:10.082 --> 01:31:14.744]  You called the police and they told you, next year this time we're coming to arrest you.
[01:31:14.744 --> 01:31:16.365]  My God.
[01:31:16.365 --> 01:31:18.546]  Everybody, you know it's coming.
[01:31:18.546 --> 01:31:19.567]  This is so horrible.
[01:31:22.930 --> 01:31:27.197]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNLive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[01:31:34.716 --> 01:31:39.558]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:31:39.558 --> 01:31:43.940]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:31:43.940 --> 01:31:44.800]  We listened.
[01:31:44.800 --> 01:31:50.062]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:31:50.062 --> 01:31:50.923]  We listened.
[01:31:50.923 --> 01:31:54.384]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:31:54.384 --> 01:31:55.405]  We listened.
[01:31:55.405 --> 01:31:58.686]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power
[01:31:58.766 --> 01:31:59.066]  I think so.
[01:32:13.843 --> 01:32:15.824]  And made in America.
[01:32:15.824 --> 01:32:18.644]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water purifier.
[01:32:18.644 --> 01:32:20.365]  Only $279.

[01:32:29.607 --> 01:32:35.309]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:32:35.309 --> 01:32:37.689]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:32:37.689 --> 01:32:40.470]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:47.176 --> 01:32:48.477]  Big Brother.
[01:32:48.477 --> 01:32:50.239]  Mainstream media.
[01:32:50.239 --> 01:32:52.000]  Government cover-ups.
[01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:53.582]  You want answers?
[01:32:53.582 --> 01:32:55.143]  Well, so does he.
[01:32:55.143 --> 01:32:59.327]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:59.327 --> 01:33:03.931]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:33:03.931 --> 01:33:06.994]  Now, we don't know if this is more government disinfo.
[01:33:06.994 --> 01:33:07.694]  It's from Fox 25.
[01:33:07.694 --> 01:33:14.100]  We also have a source in WNET out of Scranton about National Guard.
[01:33:14.944 --> 01:33:19.568]  ...being mobilized in those areas.
[01:33:19.568 --> 01:33:20.989]  This is Fox 25.
[01:33:20.989 --> 01:33:21.289]  U.S.
[01:33:21.289 --> 01:33:25.232]  Marshals served search warrant to seize Brown's dental office.
[01:33:25.232 --> 01:33:25.473]  U.S.
[01:33:25.473 --> 01:33:35.261]  Marshals Service says a supporter of the fugitives was detained near the Browns' home this morning and that they served a federal warrant to seize Elaine Brown's dental office.
[01:33:35.261 --> 01:33:40.485]  Now, if they were on the property or near it and grabbed this guy while he was walking the dog,
[01:33:41.748 --> 01:33:44.990]  That could be a cover for him or he probably means he's a good guy, a hero.
[01:33:46.396 --> 01:33:51.098]  But that means that they've done an abortive coup, and I said this in the first hour.
[01:33:51.098 --> 01:33:57.079]  I said, just because they've surrounded, just because they're evacuating nearby houses, doesn't mean they'll move in.
[01:33:57.079 --> 01:34:01.461]  They'll come in, and they'll, like a pit bull grabbing a little puppy.
[01:34:01.461 --> 01:34:05.382]  It'll grab it, and bite it, and then let go, and then grab it again.
[01:34:05.382 --> 01:34:07.082]  We saw this in Indianapolis Baptist Temple.
[01:34:07.082 --> 01:34:08.103]  I've seen this MO.
[01:34:08.103 --> 01:34:14.885]  Before they invaded Panama, they did drills for months, where they'd act like they were going to invade, until the Panamanians finally stood down when the real attack came.
[01:34:15.926 --> 01:34:17.207]  Now they do this.
[01:34:17.207 --> 01:34:19.348]  They cry wolf.
[01:34:19.348 --> 01:34:21.951]  So we'll put out the report and be seen as crying wolf.
[01:34:21.951 --> 01:34:22.411]  You understand?
[01:34:22.411 --> 01:34:26.555]  They'll send a wolf out, we'll report it, and then people say, well, where's the wolf?
[01:34:26.555 --> 01:34:29.857]  By the time the media's done, they'll say there was never police, nobody was ever out there.
[01:34:29.857 --> 01:34:32.420]  But I got AP, I got local news, they are there.
[01:34:32.420 --> 01:34:33.881]  And this could be another shill.
[01:34:35.467 --> 01:34:44.489]  Because if they've already engaged and grabbed people off near the property or on the property, and they've already shut down roads and evacuating houses, they're probably still moving in.
[01:34:44.489 --> 01:34:48.749]  That's what my gut tells me, but it may be wrong, because they may not know what they're going to do.
[01:34:48.749 --> 01:34:59.231]  Jack McClam, with your military and police experience, and with you also, Pastor Butch Paul, with your experience, what do you think with this new intel?
[01:34:59.231 --> 01:35:02.512]  What's your gut level on that?
[01:35:02.512 --> 01:35:03.652]  You asking me or Jack, Alex?
[01:35:03.652 --> 01:35:04.092]  Both of you.
[01:35:05.712 --> 01:35:07.432]  Jack?
[01:35:07.432 --> 01:35:09.693]  Jack, I don't hear Jack.
[01:35:09.693 --> 01:35:13.194]  But I don't know exactly what's happening.
[01:35:13.194 --> 01:35:20.916]  Obviously I'm not there, but I think this is another practice maneuver with the feds, with the military.
[01:35:20.916 --> 01:35:22.376]  This is getting people used to the idea.
[01:35:22.376 --> 01:35:22.896]  It's a laboratory.
[01:35:22.896 --> 01:35:23.377]  It's a laboratory.
[01:35:23.377 --> 01:35:23.697]  Absolutely.
[01:35:23.697 --> 01:35:25.277]  This is another practice.
[01:35:25.277 --> 01:35:26.277]  They're getting better at it.
[01:35:26.277 --> 01:35:28.098]  You have to give them credit where credit's due.
[01:35:28.098 --> 01:35:28.898]  They're getting good at this.
[01:35:29.338 --> 01:35:30.998]  They do it almost undercover.
[01:35:30.998 --> 01:35:32.199]  They take the press out.
[01:35:32.199 --> 01:35:33.299]  They go in and do it.
[01:35:33.299 --> 01:35:35.299]  And then the news cleans it up for them.
[01:35:35.299 --> 01:35:36.279]  These people are radicals.
[01:35:36.279 --> 01:35:37.099]  They had a compound.
[01:35:37.099 --> 01:35:38.320]  They probably had bombs in the house.
[01:35:38.320 --> 01:35:39.100]  They had weapons in the house.
[01:35:39.100 --> 01:35:40.220]  Probably machine guns.
[01:35:40.220 --> 01:35:41.900]  They just left it at Ruby Ridge and Waco.
[01:35:41.900 --> 01:35:42.580]  That's what they did.
[01:35:42.580 --> 01:35:43.141]  No, no, no.
[01:35:43.141 --> 01:35:45.221]  They're painting them as demons.
[01:35:45.221 --> 01:35:45.501]  Yes.
[01:35:45.501 --> 01:35:48.001]  And this is all... They got a compound.
[01:35:48.001 --> 01:35:49.142]  There's a bomb truck.
[01:35:49.142 --> 01:35:50.022]  They got bombs.
[01:35:50.022 --> 01:35:51.202]  They're not human.
[01:35:51.202 --> 01:35:53.843]  Jack McClam?
[01:35:53.843 --> 01:35:55.383]  Did we lose Jack?
[01:35:55.383 --> 01:35:56.203]  Apparently we lost Jack.
[01:35:57.793 --> 01:35:59.994]  You know what, I think he walked away from his mic.
[01:35:59.994 --> 01:36:01.815]  He's probably got some new intel coming in.
[01:36:01.815 --> 01:36:03.156]  Just put him on hold.
[01:36:03.156 --> 01:36:04.697]  Keep him live for when he comes back.
[01:36:04.697 --> 01:36:08.959]  I can hear background stuff in his compound, his home.
[01:36:08.959 --> 01:36:12.642]  But Jack, this is unbelievable.
[01:36:12.642 --> 01:36:13.122]  He's there now.
[01:36:13.846 --> 01:36:15.027]  Jack, this is just in.
[01:36:15.027 --> 01:36:16.728]  It sounds like disinfo.
[01:36:16.728 --> 01:36:26.035]  Either way, I said first hour, they could move in, evacuate everybody, grab this guy off the property, and then say they're not raiding his house right now.
[01:36:26.035 --> 01:36:34.961]  Clearly, they have surrounded it now for a siege, it looks like, and to keep the press and media and citizens back, they're saying it's all over, but saying that they're staying in place.
[01:36:34.961 --> 01:36:36.462]  This from Fox 25.
[01:36:36.462 --> 01:36:37.903]  We've seen this before, haven't we, Jack?
[01:36:38.638 --> 01:36:39.639]  You better believe it.
[01:36:39.639 --> 01:36:44.482]  I was there at Ruby Ridge and saw the 500 militarized troops there.
[01:36:44.482 --> 01:36:56.389]  But what we have here is could very well be a PSYOPs operation where they're trying to get us headed that way to where they can cause a
[01:36:57.453 --> 01:37:00.475]  uh... martial law scenario so they're putting out this information.
[01:37:00.475 --> 01:37:26.672]  Yeah I smell a big fat gigantic stinking rat which which which I felt earlier at the start of the show who knows who we can trust in all of this that's right we can only trust our lord and ourselves uh... but anyway I'm saying that uh... it is not over okay until we fire our gun because then the first amendment is gone
[01:37:27.427 --> 01:37:29.129]  And they love that.
[01:37:29.129 --> 01:37:31.612]  That's exactly what they want.
[01:37:31.612 --> 01:37:38.441]  And they want us to shut down the system that's awakening hundreds of thousands of people a day across the country.
[01:37:38.441 --> 01:37:39.042]  We'll be right back.
[01:37:39.042 --> 01:37:41.445]  Stay with us, Jack McClellan and Butch Paw.
[01:37:41.445 --> 01:37:42.226]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:37:45.939 --> 01:37:51.769]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:37:51.769 --> 01:37:59.422]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:38:00.089 --> 01:38:07.531]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:38:07.531 --> 01:38:19.274]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:38:19.274 --> 01:38:23.254]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:38:23.254 --> 01:38:25.495]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:38:25.495 --> 01:38:29.356]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:39:44.542 --> 01:39:48.903]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[01:39:48.903 --> 01:39:50.924]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[01:39:50.924 --> 01:39:57.505]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[01:39:57.505 --> 01:40:03.867]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[01:40:03.867 --> 01:40:09.888]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:40:10.188 --> 01:40:16.756]  With no side effects, the 2006 Biosolutions Plus is the easiest to operate frequency instrument ever developed.
[01:40:16.756 --> 01:40:20.601]  It's easy reference guide will allow you to begin using the instrument within minutes.
[01:40:20.601 --> 01:40:24.485]  Simple step-by-step instructions using pictures are easy to follow.
[01:40:24.485 --> 01:40:27.169]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[01:40:27.169 --> 01:40:28.230]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[01:40:28.370 --> 01:40:31.753]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:40:31.753 --> 01:40:33.595]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:40:54.477 --> 01:40:59.921]  We're working on getting a state representative who's been pro-Ed Brown and Elaine Brown on.
[01:40:59.921 --> 01:41:01.763]  It's clear there's a siege going on.
[01:41:01.763 --> 01:41:14.333]  AP, two newspapers, and two different TV stations, three TV stations, have reported that they have blocked it off for miles, evacuating houses, have moved in.
[01:41:15.077 --> 01:41:19.639]  With now, it looks like hundreds of state and federal terrorist forces, literally.
[01:41:19.639 --> 01:41:21.820]  I mean, just goon military forces.
[01:41:21.820 --> 01:41:23.141]  Look how cowardly they are.
[01:41:23.141 --> 01:41:30.905]  I mean, five guys, six guys could go in and, you know, if they were properly trained, you know, just evil scum and, you know, deal with a man and a woman.
[01:41:30.905 --> 01:41:36.728]  But no, they're just, you saw them when they get, the feds tell them to stand down when they pulled that off in Virginia a few months ago.
[01:41:36.728 --> 01:41:38.989]  They just do it, waddling around with their machine guns.
[01:41:39.785 --> 01:41:40.006]  I think so.
[01:41:54.605 --> 01:41:54.885]  I think so.
[01:42:15.086 --> 01:42:16.647]  Bullies will bully as long as they can.
[01:42:16.647 --> 01:42:18.548]  But I'll make one quick announcement.
[01:42:18.548 --> 01:42:27.471]  On my program tonight, 9 o'clock Eastern, on Genesis, on different stations and on shortwave, on my broadcast tonight, I'm going to counsel a guest, and I'm not going to have a guest.
[01:42:27.471 --> 01:42:29.392]  I'm going to have the lines open for updates on this.
[01:42:29.392 --> 01:42:31.533]  So anybody that wants to call in tonight, on my program at 800-259-7000,
[01:42:33.234 --> 01:42:35.655]  5-7-9-1, 9 p.m.
[01:42:35.655 --> 01:42:36.275]  Eastern.
[01:42:36.275 --> 01:42:37.215]  We're going to do an update.
[01:42:37.215 --> 01:42:37.815]  Absolutely.
[01:42:37.815 --> 01:42:43.537]  In fact, I'm going to attempt on the other Genesis Shows today to be calling in and help the different shows with reports.
[01:42:43.537 --> 01:42:44.057]  You too, Alex.
[01:42:44.057 --> 01:42:45.738]  You call in, please, if you hear anything else.
[01:42:45.738 --> 01:42:47.658]  And Jack, you're on the air an hour before I am.
[01:42:47.658 --> 01:42:52.580]  You please feel free to call in, too, and share, because, Lord bless me, there's a lot of outlets here now, and I want to get the news out there.
[01:42:52.580 --> 01:42:55.281]  So tonight, 9 o'clock, we should have a whole lot more story to this.
[01:42:55.281 --> 01:42:57.481]  So my hour will be open tonight at 9 o'clock p.m.
[01:42:57.481 --> 01:42:57.821]  Eastern, 800-259-5791.
[01:43:00.362 --> 01:43:03.647]  Continual coverage here on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:43:03.647 --> 01:43:07.191]  I want to still get Luke Rodowski on because he interviewed Ed three days ago.
[01:43:09.048 --> 01:43:33.830]  on Monday before they went to the Republican Convention and got arrested themselves with Matt LePacek and uh... and Matt and everybody else that was witnessed by the American Freedom of Fascism reporters uh... there uh... with the loose change crew uh... and I meant to get the father on who was standing up against 9-11 with a sign so the CPS took his son and said you're not allowed to uh... this is key now and I want to go back and recap everything that's happened and what we know is happening right now but this is key
[01:43:34.725 --> 01:43:59.823]  A law enforcement technology magazine four years ago, I'll never forget it, said, this is a federal guideline, and they were talking about documents they'd seen, similar documents we've seen, we've put out, it's been now in the AP, but this is some separate stuff that said in there, if someone has a get us out of the UN sticker on their car, they're a terrorist, it said are a terrorist, they are to be arrested, and it said police chiefs
[01:44:01.102 --> 01:44:07.085]  Call the Feds in, interrogate them, look for weapons, at least arrest them, and bring them in for questioning.
[01:44:07.085 --> 01:44:14.129]  Now, Butch, you put out a newsletter that's mainly mainstream articles, it's really thick, it's excellent, I get it.
[01:44:14.129 --> 01:44:20.292]  It's just got stuff I never even found, but most of it's mainstream, just a big, thick compilation of news and important things that happened.
[01:44:21.753 --> 01:44:32.498]  But regardless of what it was, you now have had two different listeners arrested who had it, and then you told me, if I'm correct, you were talking fast as we were excited, that you called the cops that did this?
[01:44:32.498 --> 01:44:32.738]  No.
[01:44:32.738 --> 01:44:34.719]  And they said, you're going to be arrested?
[01:44:34.719 --> 01:44:39.182]  No, one of the gentlemen stopped one of the cops from Pennsylvania, his name is George, called me today.
[01:44:39.182 --> 01:44:47.246]  The cop that stopped him and saw the magazine said, that's subversive material, and this time next year, you'll be arrested if that's found in your possession.
[01:44:47.566 --> 01:44:50.548]  Now, didn't you say that somebody else got taken in for five hours?
[01:44:50.548 --> 01:44:56.230]  In Ohio, a guy named Howard was at a seminar this past weekend, was stopped by the police.
[01:44:56.230 --> 01:45:00.673]  They saw my magazine first, and then they saw Constitution, they saw Roadmap.
[01:45:00.673 --> 01:45:03.394]  They called the FBI Terrorism Task Force.
[01:45:03.394 --> 01:45:06.816]  He's arrested, taken down to the police station.
[01:45:06.816 --> 01:45:11.298]  Then when the FBI come, they took him into another office, handcuffed him, ankle cuffed him to a chair.
[01:45:11.958 --> 01:45:19.045]  And, uh, interrogated him for five hours and said, well, he looks like you're part of a militia because, uh, from a news magazine, he is the picture of the Minuteman.
[01:45:19.045 --> 01:45:23.229]  Uh, and, uh... Which, by the way, is at state capitals everywhere in the U.S.
[01:45:23.229 --> 01:45:23.749]  Capitol.
[01:45:23.749 --> 01:45:25.591]  I mean, that's just the symbol of a guy, you know, with a gun.
[01:45:26.218 --> 01:45:31.244]  But they said because, by the way, as you mentioned, this brochure has been out for years.
[01:45:31.244 --> 01:45:39.374]  Anyone who's called an anti-government group, if you have, for example, bumpers that say gun control equals enslavement, or the Constitution has been subverted, or the U.S.
[01:45:39.374 --> 01:45:40.535]  has gone... But they say that!
[01:45:40.535 --> 01:45:44.160]  Or you believe, in the Bilderberg Group, or an international conspiracy,
[01:45:45.845 --> 01:45:47.086]  I mean, let me just stop you.
[01:45:47.086 --> 01:45:52.931]  In America, in the 20 loopholes in the immigration bill, which by the way is not dead, that is pure bull.
[01:45:52.931 --> 01:45:54.852]  Okay, they're going to bring it back up next week.
[01:45:54.852 --> 01:45:58.495]  Okay, just like two weeks ago they claimed it was dead and tried to vote it today.
[01:45:58.495 --> 01:46:05.201]  This is the military tactics, just like they're saying he's not surrounded now, but everybody's evacuated and he is surrounded with Ed Brown.
[01:46:05.201 --> 01:46:12.567]  This is all military tactics where they say this is not an assault, as they're killing you, just enough so you hesitate, that moment of hesitation and they win.
[01:46:13.391 --> 01:46:18.594]  In the bill, we read the subsection yesterday, child molester illegal aliens are allowed in.
[01:46:18.594 --> 01:46:19.135]  Unlimited.
[01:46:19.135 --> 01:46:22.116]  I'm not kidding, it's in the subsection.
[01:46:22.116 --> 01:46:25.078]  Any MS-13 gang members are allowed in.
[01:46:25.078 --> 01:46:26.599]  It actually says it.
[01:46:26.599 --> 01:46:28.060]  Okay, you could not make this up.
[01:46:28.992 --> 01:46:46.478]  It actually says, total blanket amnesty for twelve years, not six, they've doubled it, for anyone that wants to be here, total unlimited skilled and unskilled visas, total end, total legalization, social security cards on the first visit, unlimited legalization.
[01:46:46.478 --> 01:46:47.838]  That's all okay.
[01:46:47.838 --> 01:46:50.399]  While these groups run around saying this is Mexico.
[01:46:50.399 --> 01:46:57.081]  And openly saying it on big radio owned stations that aren't even owned by Mexicans.
[01:46:57.961 --> 01:47:11.234]  But then, if you've got a pocket constitution, anybody that doubts that it's in Road to Tyranny, that happened in 2000, Abbey Newman, they find a pocket constitution, they find a Harrison Ford video, Patriot Games, the word Patriot first got them upset.
[01:47:11.234 --> 01:47:12.415]  They're so dumb, folks.
[01:47:12.415 --> 01:47:13.756]  These are state police!
[01:47:13.756 --> 01:47:15.137]  This isn't me, it's on tape!
[01:47:15.137 --> 01:47:15.938]  These are so evil!
[01:47:16.548 --> 01:47:17.989]  Okay, but so stupid!
[01:47:17.989 --> 01:47:23.335]  And they say, this is paraphernalia, this is contraband, should we charge her for that?
[01:47:23.335 --> 01:47:26.798]  And one of them thinks and goes, maybe she's allowed to have that.
[01:47:26.798 --> 01:47:28.620]  You evil piece of filth!
[01:47:28.620 --> 01:47:29.741]  This is America!
[01:47:29.741 --> 01:47:31.382]  You swore an oath to that!
[01:47:31.382 --> 01:47:38.369]  Jack McClam, what is it like for you to know that cops nationwide, when they see the Constitution, start getting upset?
[01:47:38.369 --> 01:47:39.750]  What is wrong with them?
[01:47:39.750 --> 01:47:40.471]  How in the...
[01:47:41.603 --> 01:47:43.464]  How in the hell are they that stupid?
[01:47:43.464 --> 01:47:44.905]  Forgive me.
[01:47:44.905 --> 01:47:47.007]  We're about to... The revolution's on, folks.
[01:47:47.007 --> 01:47:50.229]  How have we gotten to this point, Jack McClain?
[01:47:50.229 --> 01:47:51.750]  Well, brother, I'll tell you.
[01:47:51.750 --> 01:47:53.230]  I see the other side.
[01:47:53.230 --> 01:48:02.276]  I see contact from our police and soldiers that are waking up to this conspiracy and this evil treason that's going on.
[01:48:02.276 --> 01:48:07.299]  But, of course, I do know we contact police officers... You've got a phone off the hook at your office.
[01:48:07.299 --> 01:48:08.500]  Somebody's listening at your office.
[01:48:09.474 --> 01:48:12.116]  Yeah, what happened is somebody at your office was listening on the other line.
[01:48:12.116 --> 01:48:15.259]  Jack, can you get them to hang up?
[01:48:15.259 --> 01:48:18.462]  But if anybody is listening on the other line, please hang up.
[01:48:18.462 --> 01:48:20.384]  They didn't know.
[01:48:20.384 --> 01:48:23.727]  They were listening, and then they didn't hang it up right.
[01:48:23.727 --> 01:48:25.268]  Or something's going on.
[01:48:25.268 --> 01:48:26.589]  But, Butch, do you have somebody off the line?
[01:48:26.589 --> 01:48:28.171]  I can't hear you as well either, Alex.
[01:48:28.171 --> 01:48:29.672]  Tell you what, I'm going to put you both on the line.
[01:48:29.672 --> 01:48:31.554]  No one's on my line here, no.
[01:48:31.554 --> 01:48:33.155]  Jack, can you hang up and call us right back?
[01:48:35.367 --> 01:48:36.669]  I've got to do it.
[01:48:36.669 --> 01:48:37.370]  Get Jack back on.
[01:48:37.370 --> 01:48:39.172]  I want him for the rest of the hour, but we can't do this.
[01:48:39.172 --> 01:48:40.394]  I'm on the ISDN line, sir.
[01:48:40.394 --> 01:48:41.195]  Nobody's on this line.
[01:48:41.195 --> 01:48:42.216]  Yeah, go ahead and let Jack go.
[01:48:42.216 --> 01:48:48.645]  Okay, that's the network sending me an off-the-hook tone.
[01:48:48.645 --> 01:48:49.646]  Okay.
[01:48:49.646 --> 01:48:51.108]  Now, was that the network, or was that Jack?
[01:48:54.258 --> 01:48:54.919]  Okay, get him back.
[01:48:54.919 --> 01:49:03.024]  John's doing, literally, answering the phones, running the show, and he is trying to get me different press reporters and different people from inside.
[01:49:03.024 --> 01:49:06.506]  So, but Jack, I think it was Jack's phone, actually, because it was really low.
[01:49:06.506 --> 01:49:07.267]  What is it like?
[01:49:07.267 --> 01:49:08.508]  I mean, I'm not kidding, cops.
[01:49:08.508 --> 01:49:11.249]  Maybe you haven't a higher level detective or a state trooper.
[01:49:11.249 --> 01:49:12.470]  You haven't been in this training.
[01:49:12.470 --> 01:49:16.613]  They say Founding Fathers are terrorists, Christians are enemies of America on video.
[01:49:16.613 --> 01:49:19.975]  I was in Kansas City in the classroom with FEMA teaching it.
[01:49:19.975 --> 01:49:23.918]  We had the preachers on last year, Butch, where they're teaching them to tell your
[01:49:24.138 --> 01:49:25.439]  Marshall Law is coming.
[01:49:25.439 --> 01:49:26.940]  Tell people to turn their guns in.
[01:49:26.940 --> 01:49:28.462]  They're not joking, folks.
[01:49:28.462 --> 01:49:29.603]  They're moving!
[01:49:29.603 --> 01:49:30.503]  That's happening.
[01:49:30.503 --> 01:49:38.210]  By the way, the gentleman who was arrested in Ohio asked the FBI agents when he was being interrogated, didn't you all not take an oath to uphold the Constitution?
[01:49:38.210 --> 01:49:41.913]  Why is it all of a sudden a piece of literature that's controversial?
[01:49:42.453 --> 01:49:43.634]  No answer, of course.
[01:49:43.634 --> 01:49:48.920]  But this, again, is obviously, as Jack said, this is probably, or you said, a psychopsy.
[01:49:48.920 --> 01:49:50.081]  I have no doubt this is.
[01:49:50.081 --> 01:49:51.542]  It is mind control.
[01:49:51.542 --> 01:49:52.623]  This is mind control.
[01:49:52.623 --> 01:49:54.125]  This is people control.
[01:49:54.125 --> 01:49:55.586]  Fear is control.
[01:49:55.586 --> 01:50:00.771]  And we don't fear, but I realize, and obviously neither does Andy Lane.
[01:50:00.771 --> 01:50:02.593]  But again, Jack talked about the First Amendment.
[01:50:02.593 --> 01:50:03.273]  I'm all for that.
[01:50:03.273 --> 01:50:04.395]  Hallelujah for the First Amendment.
[01:50:04.395 --> 01:50:06.016]  But how about the Second Amendment?
[01:50:06.016 --> 01:50:06.717]  What's it there for?
[01:50:08.112 --> 01:50:12.516]  I mean, is it there for us to hold reserve until they murder some more of us?
[01:50:12.516 --> 01:50:12.957]  I don't know.
[01:50:12.957 --> 01:50:14.058]  I'm asking a question.
[01:50:14.058 --> 01:50:15.879]  This is a sincere question on my heart and mind.
[01:50:15.879 --> 01:50:18.081]  Well, all I'm saying is we need to wait and see what happens with all this.
[01:50:18.081 --> 01:50:18.562]  I agree.
[01:50:18.562 --> 01:50:23.186]  That's why tonight, 9 o'clock, folks listening, please, tonight, tune in to our broadcast.
[01:50:23.186 --> 01:50:24.607]  I understand, but we will.
[01:50:24.607 --> 01:50:27.570]  We're going to plug that before you leave us.
[01:50:27.570 --> 01:50:29.772]  I've got a bunch of other numbers and contacts here for reporters.
[01:50:29.772 --> 01:50:30.753]  Do we have Jack McClamback?
[01:50:33.018 --> 01:50:34.620]  Okay, we'll get him back on.
[01:50:34.620 --> 01:50:38.365]  And Luke Rudowsky also interviewed him, Infowars.com reporter on Monday.
[01:50:38.365 --> 01:50:39.927]  That video interview is up on the web.
[01:50:39.927 --> 01:50:40.728]  We're getting links to that.
[01:50:40.728 --> 01:50:43.491]  Continual coverage of all this at PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:50:43.491 --> 01:50:44.032]  And don't forget,
[01:50:44.744 --> 01:50:54.388]  We're going to have a protest against the New World Order, against Waco, and against what's happening to Edna Lane Brown tonight here in Austin, Texas at the Governor's Mansion with the Bilderberg Traitor, Rick Perry.
[01:50:54.388 --> 01:50:59.049]  I'm calling for a Logan Act investigation, a clear felony violation of it.
[01:50:59.049 --> 01:51:06.432]  I'm calling for an official investigation by grand juries of this, and we're going to be down there tonight exposing the Governor.
[01:51:06.432 --> 01:51:07.752]  I mean, we're in their face, folks.
[01:51:07.752 --> 01:51:08.593]  We're asking for it.
[01:51:08.593 --> 01:51:09.293]  That's what we're doing.
[01:51:10.013 --> 01:51:16.277]  And, uh, well, we're putting ourselves in the way of the fist, but that's... They're intimidated right now is what they're trying to make their move.
[01:51:16.277 --> 01:51:18.638]  7 o'clock, down there in front of the Governor's Mansion, right off 11th Street.
[01:51:18.638 --> 01:51:19.658]  Just go to the Capitol.
[01:51:19.658 --> 01:51:20.599]  Go to the Governor's Mansion.
[01:51:20.599 --> 01:51:21.499]  You can't miss it.
[01:51:21.499 --> 01:51:22.460]  I want to see you there tonight.
[01:51:22.460 --> 01:51:23.861]  Call three of your friends and bring them.
[01:51:23.861 --> 01:51:24.861]  I know it's spontaneous.
[01:51:24.861 --> 01:51:26.502]  I just announced it yesterday.
[01:51:26.502 --> 01:51:28.303]  I want to see everybody there today.
[01:51:28.303 --> 01:51:30.244]  I want to see you there at 7 o'clock.
[01:51:30.244 --> 01:51:32.785]  And then I'll call in and report to you, Butch, later.
[01:51:32.785 --> 01:51:35.647]  I got a bunch of other, uh, numbers here.
[01:51:36.995 --> 01:51:42.859]  Uh, to, uh, call, uh, with people that have talked to, uh, Ed and Elaine Brown.
[01:51:42.859 --> 01:51:46.202]  Reportedly, we'll find out what, uh, happens, uh, there.
[01:51:46.202 --> 01:51:47.202]  We know this.
[01:51:47.202 --> 01:51:51.825]  The feds and the state police with armored vehicles, drones, helicopters moved in.
[01:51:51.825 --> 01:51:53.767]  We know drones, a drone was there last night.
[01:51:54.347 --> 01:51:57.349]  Now, we know they evacuated for upwards of over a mile.
[01:51:57.349 --> 01:52:01.031]  It says for several miles in the newspaper that they've got checkpoints blocking people.
[01:52:01.031 --> 01:52:03.893]  They're saying, don't worry, we're not raiding this compound.
[01:52:03.893 --> 01:52:05.053]  I understand that, Alex.
[01:52:05.053 --> 01:52:08.495]  A mile away in New Hampshire, they can't see anything.
[01:52:08.495 --> 01:52:10.536]  It's wooded, it's hilly.
[01:52:10.536 --> 01:52:13.398]  It's not like a mile away in Texas where it's flat level in some places.
[01:52:13.398 --> 01:52:15.319]  No one can get them with any kind of camera.
[01:52:15.319 --> 01:52:15.840]  Too far away.
[01:52:15.840 --> 01:52:20.002]  Well, in Waco, they kept them a mile and a half away, but the Germans still got the video of them.
[01:52:21.478 --> 01:52:23.780]  New Hampshire's so wooded, though, they can't see that far away.
[01:52:23.780 --> 01:52:26.422]  Unless there's no airplane.
[01:52:26.422 --> 01:52:28.524]  You know, this is where the Patriots fought the Redcoats.
[01:52:28.524 --> 01:52:30.485]  Right there in the same spot.
[01:52:30.485 --> 01:52:35.549]  The live, free, or die state, and that's what Ed Brown and Lane Brown are doing right now.
[01:52:35.549 --> 01:52:38.972]  Continual coverage, as new developments break on the other side.
[01:52:43.013 --> 01:52:48.277]  Now, you can bring Berkey Purification Power anywhere with the Sport Berkey Filtration Bottle.

[01:53:01.727 --> 01:53:05.150]  So effective, you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers, and streams.

[01:53:15.093 --> 01:53:18.814]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[01:53:18.814 --> 01:53:26.196]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.

[01:53:42.156 --> 01:53:43.798]  Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[01:53:43.798 --> 01:53:44.058]  June 7, 2007.
[01:53:44.058 --> 01:53:44.258]  Gold 68883.
[01:53:44.258 --> 01:53:46.040]  Ounce gold coins can be purchased for $689.83, $340.35 for half, $170.18 for quarter.
[01:53:46.040 --> 01:53:46.320]  That's $689.83, $340.15, and $170.18.
[01:53:46.320 --> 01:53:47.741]  70% of China's one trillion reserves are in dollar.
[01:53:47.741 --> 01:53:49.343]  Now purchasing 250,000 barrels of oil per day from Iran in euro.
[01:53:49.343 --> 01:53:51.044]  Japanese refiners buy 550,000 barrels, switching dollar to yen.
[01:53:51.044 --> 01:53:51.645]  Bad news for U.S.
[01:53:51.645 --> 01:53:51.965]  currency.
[01:54:08.860 --> 01:54:11.163]  China and Japan hold large positions in dollar.
[01:54:11.163 --> 01:54:12.844]  Trading equals permanent loss.
[01:54:12.844 --> 01:54:15.067]  Dollars fall into 65% of euro.
[01:54:15.067 --> 01:54:16.308]  Erosion accelerates.
[01:54:16.308 --> 01:54:19.011]  Countries despise imperialistic policy of U.S.
[01:54:19.011 --> 01:54:21.093]  Loss of confidence causing more selling.
[01:54:21.093 --> 01:54:23.796]  GAO is warning about the debt spiraling out of control.
[01:54:23.796 --> 01:54:24.837]  Why attack Iran?
[01:54:24.837 --> 01:54:27.900]  Jerome O'Coursey's Iran leads attack against the U.S.
[01:54:27.900 --> 01:54:29.322]  dollar document spells it out.
[01:54:29.462 --> 01:54:31.923]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:54:31.923 --> 01:54:35.565]  The value of your hard-earned money is being destroyed in a global game of chess.
[01:54:35.565 --> 01:54:39.147]  Call 800-686-2237 for Corsi's report today.
[01:54:39.147 --> 01:54:42.168]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:54:42.168 --> 01:54:46.670]  If you've ever wanted to grow the absolute best-tasting fruits and vegetables imaginable, here's some exciting news.
[01:54:46.670 --> 01:54:49.532]  There's a new product designed to make growing delicious produce easy.
[01:54:49.532 --> 01:54:52.153]  It's called ProtoGro, and it's dynamite in the garden.
[01:54:52.153 --> 01:54:58.996]  ProtoGro is a bioactive superfood for plants that works by providing true broad-spectrum nutrition, allowing plants to achieve their full genetic expression.
[01:54:59.176 --> 01:55:00.377]  What does this mean in the garden?
[01:55:00.377 --> 01:55:11.764]  It means mouth-watering fruits and vegetables, brilliantly colored flowers, herbs that finally grow to medicinal strength, blue-ribbon garden produce jam-packed with bioavailable minerals and trace elements, giant pumpkins, even high-potency, high-bricks wheatgrass.
[01:55:11.764 --> 01:55:14.966]  Proto-Gro is a proprietary blend of full-spectrum nutrients from the sea.
[01:55:14.966 --> 01:55:17.768]  It literally contains the basic building blocks of life itself.
[01:55:17.768 --> 01:55:25.052]  In fact, Proto-Gro is so effective at producing rapid plant growth in record time that it almost forces plants to grow even under the worst light and soil conditions.
[01:55:25.052 --> 01:55:27.174]  It's also perfect for growing your own survival foods.
[01:55:27.574 --> 01:55:28.115]  I don't think so.
[01:55:42.239 --> 01:55:46.081]  Are you looking for a one-stop shop to find all your favorite books and videos?
[01:55:46.081 --> 01:55:47.241]  Look no further!
[01:55:47.241 --> 01:55:50.243]  Northern Voice Bookstore has everything you need.
[01:55:50.243 --> 01:55:58.907]  Hundreds of titles, from self-defense, survival, and financial freedom, to history, politics, conspiracy, and everything you need to know about the New World Order.
[01:55:58.907 --> 01:55:59.667]  You can order everything
[01:55:59.667 --> 01:56:00.207]  We're good to go.
[01:56:29.440 --> 01:56:30.800]  We don't know what the truth is.
[01:56:30.800 --> 01:56:33.401]  We know the feds have surrounded and evacuated for over a mile.
[01:56:58.001 --> 01:57:03.104]  We know there's armored vehicles, helicopters, paramilitary terror forces, literally.
[01:57:03.104 --> 01:57:05.866]  These are America-killing forces.
[01:57:05.866 --> 01:57:12.471]  These are occupiers of the foreign banks that completely own this country and have run us into the ground by design and demonized our name worldwide.
[01:57:12.471 --> 01:57:14.812]  Now, U.S.
[01:57:14.812 --> 01:57:23.018]  Marshals are saying they've served a search warrant on his wife's dental office and that they've surrounded the house, but they're not planning to raid it.
[01:57:23.018 --> 01:57:24.759]  Total lie.
[01:57:24.759 --> 01:57:26.180]  They're just waiting to see what happens.
[01:57:26.180 --> 01:57:27.060]  Who knows?
[01:57:27.060 --> 01:57:27.801]  There was a report
[01:57:29.737 --> 01:57:32.259]  Uh, that Butch got, that the place had been burnt down.
[01:57:32.259 --> 01:57:33.179]  We know they do that.
[01:57:33.179 --> 01:57:34.080]  That was unconfirmed.
[01:57:34.080 --> 01:57:36.061]  We don't know.
[01:57:36.061 --> 01:57:41.545]  Uh, there's an individual named Drew Raines, who I'm told has talked many times to the Browns, and been in contact with them, and talked to them today.
[01:57:41.545 --> 01:57:43.926]  I don't know if that's the case.
[01:57:43.926 --> 01:57:45.647]  We tried cell phone numbers, and our home number we have.
[01:57:45.647 --> 01:57:46.948]  We weren't able to get them.
[01:57:46.948 --> 01:57:48.009]  He'll be on with us in a few minutes.
[01:57:48.009 --> 01:57:49.050]  We'll see what's happening there.
[01:57:49.050 --> 01:57:53.472]  I know that Luke Rudowsky and fullwars.com reporter met with him on
[01:57:57.308 --> 01:58:04.471]  Monday, one of the last big interviews he's done, so we'll get Luke on in about 10 minutes with Matt LePacek and others.
[01:58:04.471 --> 01:58:10.034]  But going back to Jack McClam, Jack, when you were gone a few minutes, did you learn anything else or anything going on?
[01:58:10.034 --> 01:58:11.734]  No, no, brother.
[01:58:11.734 --> 01:58:19.158]  Our phones are ringing and ringing and ringing here in the office, and Carol is trying to take care of the calls while I'm on the radio.
[01:58:19.158 --> 01:58:21.079]  But nothing new has come in.
[01:58:21.079 --> 01:58:26.381]  We just know that we're trying to get people to call their state representatives there.
[01:58:27.028 --> 01:58:27.108]  Yes.
[01:58:46.972 --> 01:58:48.293]  And let them know we're concerned.
[01:58:48.293 --> 01:58:48.974]  Absolutely.
[01:58:48.974 --> 01:58:57.600]  In fact, on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, we'll post the phone numbers and continual coverages all there on the sides.
[01:58:57.600 --> 01:59:01.944]  Paul Watson, Steve Watson, Ryan Slickhize, and Aaron Dykes, they're all working around the clock.
[01:59:01.944 --> 01:59:04.946]  Total coverage on this at JonesReport.com.
[01:59:04.946 --> 01:59:07.788]  I know Aaron will be here until about 2 in the morning tonight on that.
[01:59:07.788 --> 01:59:09.409]  We've got our protest coming up at 7.
[01:59:09.409 --> 01:59:11.511]  It's good to have multi-state protests.
[01:59:11.511 --> 01:59:12.832]  Call all the Texas media.
[01:59:13.610 --> 01:59:14.231]  You ask why?
[01:59:14.231 --> 01:59:15.792]  This is where Waco happened.
[01:59:15.792 --> 01:59:16.533]  We're protesting.
[01:59:16.533 --> 01:59:20.617]  Don't have another Waco against, you know, for national attention.
[01:59:20.617 --> 01:59:22.499]  Like, we don't want another Waco in Texas.
[01:59:22.499 --> 01:59:23.279]  They're protesting.
[01:59:23.279 --> 01:59:27.203]  We're shifting the protests we're having for Bilderberg Grip over to that.
[01:59:27.203 --> 01:59:28.885]  Now, it's very important that everybody call.
[01:59:28.885 --> 01:59:29.946]  Don't wait for me to give you the number.
[01:59:29.946 --> 01:59:31.607]  Just get New Hampshire information.
[01:59:31.607 --> 01:59:35.311]  We've already put out the state... In fact, two days ago we put out the state police numbers.
[01:59:35.311 --> 01:59:36.372]  They're actually yesterday.
[01:59:37.192 --> 01:59:39.354]  I have the sheriff's number right here.
[01:59:39.354 --> 01:59:42.756]  I think the governor's office is the place.
[01:59:42.756 --> 01:59:55.906]  Because when they were going to raid the Gray family and had the armored vehicles and the cameras and the people all ready, and we went out there back in 1999, and when all the other patriots were cowardly and didn't go out there, I was in there alone.
[01:59:55.906 --> 01:59:57.987]  But of course I'm evil later.
[01:59:57.987 --> 02:00:01.290]  They backed off and stopped because the governor
[02:00:02.030 --> 02:00:02.550]  I have, Mr. Chairman.
[02:00:18.575 --> 02:00:19.155]  Let's go ahead.
[02:00:19.155 --> 02:00:23.257]  I wanted to let you know, I just had Crystal here in the office check the news channels.
[02:00:23.257 --> 02:00:25.118]  Fox News, CNN, she's checked them.
[02:00:25.118 --> 02:00:30.580]  The headline on those channels is Paris Hilton got out of jail because she got a rash.
[02:00:30.580 --> 02:00:31.780]  That's what's in the news on there.
[02:00:31.780 --> 02:00:34.101]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:00:34.101 --> 02:00:37.063]  Well, I have the sheriff's number here, Alex.
[02:00:37.063 --> 02:00:38.023]  Let me give that out.
[02:00:38.023 --> 02:00:42.325]  The sheriff's name is Michael Prozo.
[02:00:42.325 --> 02:00:45.306]  P-R-O-Z-Z-O.
[02:00:45.306 --> 02:00:47.647]  And he's conveniently out of town, they say.
[02:00:48.129 --> 02:00:48.990]  But his number is 603-863-4200.
[02:00:48.990 --> 02:00:52.292]  And I think we ought to just burn the phone line up.
[02:00:58.593 --> 02:01:03.536]  And tell the sheriff's deputies and anybody there to be out there and keep control.
[02:01:03.536 --> 02:01:05.217]  Okay, stay there gentlemen.
[02:01:05.217 --> 02:01:08.539]  I'm going to put you on hold because we can't bring up three people at the same time.
[02:01:08.539 --> 02:01:10.880]  Drew Raines, and now that name rings a bell.
[02:01:10.880 --> 02:01:15.482]  I know he hasn't even co-hosted for you, Jack, if my memory serves me correctly.
[02:01:15.482 --> 02:01:17.444]  Drew, exactly who have you talked to?
[02:01:17.444 --> 02:01:18.564]  Have you talked to the Browns?
[02:01:18.564 --> 02:01:19.385]  Do you know what's going on?
[02:01:19.385 --> 02:01:19.965]  Thanks for coming on.
[02:01:20.979 --> 02:01:22.900]  I appreciate the invite, and yeah, you're right.
[02:01:22.900 --> 02:01:24.700]  I do stand in for Jack McLam.
[02:01:24.700 --> 02:01:26.461]  He's my favorite officer out there.
[02:01:26.461 --> 02:01:28.801]  And I know you just love me to death, too.
[02:01:28.801 --> 02:01:29.681]  Now, that's a joke.
[02:01:29.681 --> 02:01:42.605]  The bottom line is, the bottom line here is, with all hatred or any animosity against anybody out there, this is a day of problems in America, and we as American people need to stand up.
[02:01:42.605 --> 02:01:50.047]  And yes, I did get a phone call 20 minutes before my personal show ended today from somebody inside the house.
[02:01:51.255 --> 02:02:10.131]  And they told me that they were surrounded and blocked off and that the mainline telephone was dead and they were calling from the emergency cell phone number that was given to them or a cell phone that was given to them by a personal friend of mine who is in a militia unit there in Vermont.
[02:02:10.131 --> 02:02:15.175]  Okay, stay there, stay there, but I need to understand who is in the house.
[02:02:15.175 --> 02:02:18.738]  We'll find out on the other side with Drew Raines.
[02:02:18.738 --> 02:02:19.538]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:02:19.538 --> 02:02:19.979]  Stay with us.
[02:02:33.158 --> 02:02:34.559]  We're on the march.
[02:02:34.559 --> 02:02:37.100]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:02:37.100 --> 02:02:39.781]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:02:43.797 --> 02:02:51.959]  Attention women over 40, if you want to look as much as 20 years younger in less than one minute, this will be the most important message you will ever hear.
[02:02:51.959 --> 02:02:52.679]  Here's why.
[02:02:52.679 --> 02:02:57.120]  There's a brand new cosmetic product that makes wrinkles almost invisible to the naked eye.
[02:02:57.120 --> 02:03:02.521]  In fact, the new product allows some women to look so young so fast that it makes them feel like they're cheating.
[02:03:02.521 --> 02:03:04.581]  They are in a way, but it works.
[02:03:04.581 --> 02:03:08.182]  By the way, it's also a jealously guarded secret used by professional models.
[02:03:08.402 --> 02:03:13.564]  You see, these women often have to look much younger than they really are or else they lose their jobs.
[02:03:13.564 --> 02:03:20.927]  The product uses something like a magician's trick to actually de-age the appearance of human skin and it's now available to listeners at this station.
[02:03:20.927 --> 02:03:25.489]  Want to take years off your appearance and don't want cosmetic surgery or painful injections?
[02:03:25.489 --> 02:03:30.451]  There is now a very real chance you can do it with this new cream called Simply Magician's Formula 987.
[02:03:30.451 --> 02:03:31.311]  Just go to 987magic.com.
[02:03:31.311 --> 02:03:31.752]  That's 987magic.com.
[02:03:35.473 --> 02:03:37.696]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[02:03:37.696 --> 02:03:43.362]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:03:43.362 --> 02:03:45.244]  Government is best, which governs least.
[02:03:45.244 --> 02:03:46.725]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[02:03:46.725 --> 02:03:49.929]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[02:03:49.929 --> 02:03:52.632]  What part of unconstitutional do not understand, George?
[02:03:53.206 --> 02:04:00.495]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.
[02:04:00.495 --> 02:04:08.164]  Exercise your freedom of speech by purchasing your choice of hundreds of different Liberty Stickers from humorous to serious at LibertyStickers.com
[02:04:09.105 --> 02:04:10.387]  We're good to go.
[02:04:23.902 --> 02:04:24.403]  We're good to go.
[02:04:43.599 --> 02:04:45.380]  This is Elizabeth Border.
[02:04:45.380 --> 02:04:46.540]  News alert!

[02:04:51.202 --> 02:04:52.062]  Concise?
[02:04:52.062 --> 02:04:53.042]  Hard-hitting?
[02:04:53.042 --> 02:04:56.324]  The first issue discusses two vital questions.
[02:04:56.324 --> 02:04:58.044]  War in Iran?
[02:04:58.044 --> 02:04:59.685]  A coming One World Church?
[02:05:00.465 --> 02:05:06.267]  And the first issue has included a pungent discussion of NWO numerology.

[02:06:21.812 --> 02:06:25.057]  Breaking News with Drew Reigns.
[02:06:25.057 --> 02:06:26.059]  He is a talk show host.
[02:06:26.059 --> 02:06:26.820]  I know him.
[02:06:26.820 --> 02:06:28.102]  My brain is so scrambled today.
[02:06:28.102 --> 02:06:29.704]  I didn't remember who I was on.
[02:06:29.704 --> 02:06:30.385]  Drew Reigns.
[02:06:30.385 --> 02:06:31.247]  I know Drew Reigns.
[02:06:31.247 --> 02:06:33.490]  Oh, he co-hosts for Jack McClam.
[02:06:33.490 --> 02:06:34.732]  He's got his own show.
[02:06:34.732 --> 02:06:36.235]  I know Drew from Arkansas.
[02:06:36.235 --> 02:06:36.936]  Drew's a great guy.
[02:06:37.865 --> 02:06:40.186]  Drew, you now understand why you can't tell us.
[02:06:40.186 --> 02:06:46.630]  A militiaman who lives nearby, who you have a cell phone with, part of the coverage, you got a call from him.
[02:06:46.630 --> 02:06:51.612]  Again, we can't say who to protect the family, because these feds don't play games.
[02:06:51.612 --> 02:06:52.473]  What happened this morning?
[02:06:52.473 --> 02:06:53.033]  What did you hear?
[02:06:53.033 --> 02:06:57.456]  20 minutes before my show on American Voice Radio Network... That's fine.
[02:06:57.456 --> 02:06:58.236]  What time was this?
[02:06:58.236 --> 02:07:00.257]  What time was that?
[02:07:00.257 --> 02:07:03.579]  Central Standard Time, this was approximately 11.44 a.m.
[02:07:03.579 --> 02:07:05.280]  Okay, go ahead and tell us.
[02:07:06.545 --> 02:07:14.807]  And the phone call came in, and the person on the other end tells me that, hey, Drew, something's going down here.
[02:07:14.807 --> 02:07:24.109]  I got this phone here from a certain person, and I was told to call you and let you know that the house is under attack.
[02:07:24.109 --> 02:07:25.570]  We are totally surrounded.
[02:07:25.570 --> 02:07:32.411]  There seems to be about, at least from what we can tell, 40 to 50 men outside dressed all in black.
[02:07:32.411 --> 02:07:34.932]  Can't even tell if they're sheriffs or U.S.
[02:07:34.932 --> 02:07:35.912]  Marshals or what.
[02:07:37.376 --> 02:07:43.360]  The next thing I'm told is that there is some shooting going on.
[02:07:43.360 --> 02:07:48.684]  Now, Drew, you've put out a lot of good reports in the past.
[02:07:48.684 --> 02:07:54.267]  I haven't known you to be a baloney artist, and Jack McClam respects you and believes you.
[02:07:54.267 --> 02:07:56.229]  I'm going to put a report out on this.
[02:07:56.229 --> 02:08:00.051]  I'm just telling you what I was told.
[02:08:00.051 --> 02:08:01.432]  I don't know if it's true.
[02:08:01.432 --> 02:08:03.053]  I haven't been able to confirm anything.
[02:08:03.053 --> 02:08:05.355]  No, I know, but this individual, you do know them.
[02:08:05.715 --> 02:08:08.676]  Well, I do know the individual that made the phone call, yes.
[02:08:08.676 --> 02:08:12.778]  Okay, and you know they were in New Hampshire, and like you said, they live nearby.
[02:08:12.778 --> 02:08:23.583]  I know that this individual was in this house, and he lives within a certain number of miles of this home with a militia group, because I'm in touch with several militia groups around the United States.
[02:08:23.583 --> 02:08:26.264]  Now, I don't know if the house is on fire.
[02:08:26.264 --> 02:08:28.905]  I don't know if anybody's been shot and killed.
[02:08:28.905 --> 02:08:30.606]  I am not there.
[02:08:30.606 --> 02:08:31.586]  I'm in Arkansas.
[02:08:32.364 --> 02:08:37.026]  Okay, I'm part of an informational freedom network just like you are, Alex.
[02:08:37.026 --> 02:08:39.848]  We're putting the truth out there as we get it.
[02:08:39.848 --> 02:08:40.468]  No, I understand.
[02:08:40.468 --> 02:08:41.929]  I understand.
[02:08:41.929 --> 02:08:43.089]  Nobody can second-guess that.
[02:08:43.089 --> 02:08:44.730]  That's why I'm being specifically clear.
[02:08:44.730 --> 02:08:49.693]  But for the article, it is a militia member that you know that has been in the house.
[02:08:49.693 --> 02:08:54.575]  He called you and said they were surrounded and that shots were being fired.
[02:08:54.575 --> 02:08:56.316]  Anything else, Drew Raines?
[02:08:56.316 --> 02:08:56.916]  No, sir.
[02:08:56.916 --> 02:08:58.597]  All I can tell you is that, you know,
[02:08:59.560 --> 02:09:05.485]  We need to be praying for America, because I know that these men are not going to go quietly in the night.
[02:09:05.485 --> 02:09:09.908]  They are going... I've got personal word from this man.
[02:09:09.908 --> 02:09:13.031]  He will die for freedom, and this is freedom.
[02:09:13.031 --> 02:09:14.492]  Now, how many people are in the house?
[02:09:14.492 --> 02:09:16.153]  I'm about to go to... Do we have Luke Rudowsky?
[02:09:16.153 --> 02:09:16.814]  He was there on Monday.
[02:09:17.598 --> 02:09:20.722]  I have no idea who all these people are.
[02:09:20.722 --> 02:09:26.148]  There were eight members in this house when I asked him specifically how many people are there.
[02:09:26.148 --> 02:09:27.510]  He said there are eight now.
[02:09:27.510 --> 02:09:30.373]  There were nine, but one man hasn't returned.
[02:09:30.373 --> 02:09:32.756]  He went out walking a dog and has not returned.
[02:09:32.896 --> 02:09:38.559]  Yeah, and the Feds are putting out the story that they grabbed him, but they're not attacking.
[02:09:38.559 --> 02:09:41.840]  That sounds just like Waco, but he may be either a patriot or a scoundrel.
[02:09:41.840 --> 02:09:45.582]  We're going to find out.
[02:09:45.582 --> 02:09:46.182]  Stay there, Drew.
[02:09:46.182 --> 02:09:48.203]  I'm going to bring Jack McClam and Butch up in a minute.
[02:09:48.203 --> 02:09:48.923]  We've got some people online.
[02:09:48.923 --> 02:09:50.864]  I've got to put them on hold and take them off.
[02:09:50.864 --> 02:09:55.246]  Let's bring up Luke Rudowsky, InfoWars.com, WeAreChange.org, reporter.
[02:09:56.186 --> 02:09:58.407]  He was there Monday in an interview with Ed and Elaine Brown.
[02:09:58.407 --> 02:10:00.569]  You can see up all over the web on their blog.
[02:10:00.569 --> 02:10:02.470]  You name it, it's on Ed and Elaine Brown's blog.
[02:10:02.470 --> 02:10:06.632]  We've got links to that on PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com and JonesReport.com.
[02:10:06.632 --> 02:10:08.253]  Luke Rodowski, what did you see?
[02:10:08.253 --> 02:10:10.454]  How many people were in the house three days ago?
[02:10:10.454 --> 02:10:13.775]  Three days ago we had seven WeAreChanged.org members there.
[02:10:13.775 --> 02:10:20.159]  I just really want to say really quickly, when we were there Monday, Ed and Elaine Brown were setting up UHF radio systems.
[02:10:21.201 --> 02:10:22.322]  Uh, radio systems.
[02:10:22.322 --> 02:10:24.063]  They're in the process of setting that up.
[02:10:24.063 --> 02:10:26.605]  They either set it up, or they didn't set it up yet.
[02:10:26.605 --> 02:10:33.390]  But if anybody's in the New Hampshire area, listen to UHF radio channels right now, or listen to CB radio channels right now.
[02:10:33.390 --> 02:10:36.071]  Did we get the UHF frequencies they're gonna be on?
[02:10:36.071 --> 02:10:37.152]  I don't know what frequencies.
[02:10:37.152 --> 02:10:39.133]  I know they were setting it up when we were there Monday.
[02:10:39.133 --> 02:10:41.475]  They were setting up the radio frequencies when we were there Monday.
[02:10:41.475 --> 02:10:47.019]  For all the ham radio operators, everybody, you get them set up, you start recording on those frequencies.
[02:10:47.019 --> 02:10:48.440]  I wish we would've gotten the frequencies.
[02:10:49.252 --> 02:10:50.252]  I don't know the frequency of numbers.
[02:10:50.252 --> 02:10:54.453]  I didn't want to foolishly sit on top of this thing and wait for it to happen.
[02:10:54.453 --> 02:10:56.974]  It's just unbelievable.
[02:10:56.974 --> 02:10:58.394]  Luke, what else happened while you were there?
[02:10:58.394 --> 02:11:03.535]  I mean, how many people, separate from We Are Change, how many people were with Edna Lane Brown when you were there?
[02:11:03.535 --> 02:11:05.776]  It was Edna Lane Brown and one other gentleman.
[02:11:05.776 --> 02:11:09.077]  There was only three people in the house that we noticed that were in there.
[02:11:09.077 --> 02:11:12.097]  And these people are one of the nicest people out there.
[02:11:12.097 --> 02:11:13.618]  They are true Americans.
[02:11:13.618 --> 02:11:14.378]  They are innocent.
[02:11:14.378 --> 02:11:15.378]  They did not do anything.
[02:11:15.885 --> 02:11:16.245]  Guilty.
[02:11:16.245 --> 02:11:17.386]  They're not guilty of anything.
[02:11:17.386 --> 02:11:19.768]  These are one of the most beautiful, nicest people in the world.
[02:11:19.768 --> 02:11:22.229]  The real criminals, they're outside their house right now.
[02:11:22.229 --> 02:11:23.450]  And we have to understand that.
[02:11:23.450 --> 02:11:24.811]  And I would just get a camera out.
[02:11:24.811 --> 02:11:26.352]  We just need video footage of this.
[02:11:26.352 --> 02:11:26.712]  I don't know.
[02:11:26.712 --> 02:11:27.693]  I'm heartbroken right now.
[02:11:27.693 --> 02:11:28.413]  I don't know what to say.
[02:11:28.413 --> 02:11:29.354]  I don't know what to do, man.
[02:11:29.972 --> 02:11:31.713]  Look, I know you were going to upstate New York.
[02:11:31.713 --> 02:11:32.773]  You just need to saddle up.
[02:11:32.773 --> 02:11:34.753]  If you need money, I'll send it to you.
[02:11:34.753 --> 02:11:38.234]  Are you ready to saddle up right now and get in a car?
[02:11:38.234 --> 02:11:39.715]  Not a big RV or something.
[02:11:39.715 --> 02:11:41.595]  I'll pay for a motel, whatever.
[02:11:41.595 --> 02:11:42.796]  I'll wire you money if I have to.
[02:11:42.796 --> 02:11:44.116]  Just go.
[02:11:44.116 --> 02:11:48.778]  You and the two or three people get in a car now and put the pedal to the metal.
[02:11:48.778 --> 02:11:49.578]  We're doing it.
[02:11:49.578 --> 02:11:51.738]  Okay, right now.
[02:11:51.738 --> 02:11:53.159]  Any other intel from inside the house?
[02:11:53.820 --> 02:11:54.520]  Nothing.
[02:11:54.520 --> 02:11:56.981]  These people were the nicest people there.
[02:11:56.981 --> 02:11:58.702]  We were there for the whole day just talking to them.
[02:11:58.702 --> 02:12:00.183]  We conducted a long interview with them.
[02:12:00.183 --> 02:12:03.344]  What did you think of the person that was with him?
[02:12:03.344 --> 02:12:05.045]  Was his name Reno or whatever it is?
[02:12:05.045 --> 02:12:05.925]  I think his name was Reno.
[02:12:05.925 --> 02:12:08.846]  I think it was a gentleman from Texas.
[02:12:08.846 --> 02:12:10.247]  What was your vibe?
[02:12:10.247 --> 02:12:11.608]  I don't know what kind of vibe off got him.
[02:12:11.608 --> 02:12:12.568]  I can't really say now.
[02:12:12.568 --> 02:12:14.749]  I don't know if he was a good person or a bad person, but he was there.
[02:12:15.442 --> 02:12:18.983]  I don't know if he was really a close person to them, but he was one of their security guards.
[02:12:18.983 --> 02:12:19.764]  He was watching them.
[02:12:19.764 --> 02:12:22.164]  He was always watching us.
[02:12:22.164 --> 02:12:24.925]  Now he's disappeared this morning, and they may have grabbed him off the property.
[02:12:24.925 --> 02:12:25.766]  He may be a hero.
[02:12:25.766 --> 02:12:26.306]  Probably is.
[02:12:26.306 --> 02:12:27.346]  We'll see.
[02:12:27.346 --> 02:12:28.747]  Luke Rodowski, launch!
[02:12:28.747 --> 02:12:29.207]  Launch!
[02:12:29.207 --> 02:12:29.607]  Launch!
[02:12:29.607 --> 02:12:31.167]  And don't drive recklessly.
[02:12:31.167 --> 02:12:34.869]  Hell, if you guys want to jump on an airplane, if you've got the cash on you, I'll pay it back.
[02:12:34.869 --> 02:12:36.689]  Just get yourself a couple hundred dollar tickets.
[02:12:36.689 --> 02:12:37.049]  Go!
[02:12:37.049 --> 02:12:37.289]  Go!
[02:12:37.289 --> 02:12:38.750]  But you'll need a car once you get there.
[02:12:38.750 --> 02:12:38.890]  Go!
[02:12:38.890 --> 02:12:39.090]  Alright?
[02:12:39.090 --> 02:12:39.990]  I'm getting my people right now.
[02:12:39.990 --> 02:12:41.091]  I'm getting my people right here.
[02:12:41.091 --> 02:12:41.191]  Fire!
[02:12:41.191 --> 02:12:41.371]  Fire!
[02:12:41.371 --> 02:12:41.531]  Fire!
[02:12:41.531 --> 02:12:41.791]  Good!
[02:12:42.171 --> 02:12:42.671]  Good job.
[02:12:42.671 --> 02:12:44.892]  Okay, we've launched, we've launched the probe.
[02:12:44.892 --> 02:12:45.733]  Good job.
[02:12:45.733 --> 02:12:47.634]  What a probe he is.
[02:12:47.634 --> 02:12:51.076]  Absolutely the model we need to fight the New World Order.
[02:12:51.076 --> 02:12:53.077]  Wow, I've told Aaron Russo's called in.
[02:12:53.077 --> 02:12:55.098]  America Freedom to Fascism.
[02:12:55.098 --> 02:12:56.659]  He's launched his own news gathering network.
[02:12:56.659 --> 02:12:57.419]  This is beautiful.
[02:12:57.419 --> 02:12:59.760]  It's spontaneously happening everywhere.
[02:12:59.760 --> 02:13:02.141]  And we've, but first I want to bring up Jack McClam.
[02:13:02.141 --> 02:13:06.724]  Had a comment with his friend, Drew Raines, his co-host, Drew Raines, he's a villain host.
[02:13:06.724 --> 02:13:09.505]  Jack, my friend, what do you think of all this new intel?
[02:13:09.505 --> 02:13:10.326]  Well, I think
[02:13:11.488 --> 02:13:14.350]  Drew is my favorite Marine.
[02:13:14.350 --> 02:13:16.012]  He's a hardcore patriot.
[02:13:16.012 --> 02:13:20.175]  And if he tells you something, he's going to tell you everything he knows.
[02:13:20.175 --> 02:13:23.878]  And I would tend to trust anything he tells you.
[02:13:23.878 --> 02:13:26.140]  But then again, he told you that he wasn't there.
[02:13:26.140 --> 02:13:27.901]  He's just being told this information.
[02:13:27.901 --> 02:13:30.343]  So it's secondhand information.
[02:13:30.343 --> 02:13:37.209]  But I just received a call that we would ask our people to pull up Google Earth satellite.
[02:13:37.759 --> 02:13:38.440]  I don't
[02:13:48.982 --> 02:13:55.766]  If there's anything, it's actually the satellite that will show you the pictures right there on the ground in a plain field.
[02:13:55.766 --> 02:13:56.246]  I don't know.
[02:13:56.246 --> 02:13:59.028]  You have to be a premium member, but we'll buy a membership if we have to.
[02:13:59.028 --> 02:14:01.849]  I don't know if that's... if a satellite's always over that.
[02:14:01.849 --> 02:14:03.270]  They've blocked a lot of that out.
[02:14:03.270 --> 02:14:04.091]  That's true.
[02:14:04.091 --> 02:14:04.771]  That's true.
[02:14:04.771 --> 02:14:05.591]  We're going to find out.
[02:14:05.591 --> 02:14:07.132]  We're going to find out right now.
[02:14:07.132 --> 02:14:08.473]  We'll check Google Satellite.
[02:14:08.473 --> 02:14:13.776]  I know there's Google View and Google Earth, but we'll check that.
[02:14:13.776 --> 02:14:15.517]  Drew Raines, anything else that needs to be added?
[02:14:17.664 --> 02:14:18.765]  Hello, Jack.
[02:14:18.765 --> 02:14:19.225]  Hey, brother.
[02:14:19.225 --> 02:14:20.145]  How are you doing?
[02:14:20.145 --> 02:14:20.706]  Good to talk to you.
[02:14:20.706 --> 02:14:21.626]  I'm doing great, sir.
[02:14:21.626 --> 02:14:23.166]  God bless you for all the work you're doing.
[02:14:23.166 --> 02:14:27.828]  I want to let you know that the Google satellite photos are 24-hour delay minimum.
[02:14:27.828 --> 02:14:29.189]  Oh, I see.
[02:14:29.189 --> 02:14:30.389]  Okay.
[02:14:30.389 --> 02:14:46.015]  On my network, on American Voice, a former show that I took over, we announced anybody that's in that area to meet up at truck stops and converge there at Plainfield on the New Hampshire and Vermont.
[02:14:46.861 --> 02:14:54.985]  And you know, a mass show of American people coming to the aid of an honest family who believes in freedom and justice.
[02:14:54.985 --> 02:15:04.449]  I agree, bare minimum, we need tens of thousands of people to converge there right now, peaceably, and to go up and to cover what's happening.
[02:15:04.449 --> 02:15:07.070]  And they need to see the same thing that happened at Ruby Ridge.
[02:15:07.070 --> 02:15:11.432]  Jack, before we go to Aaron Russo, briefly break down what happened at Ruby Ridge.
[02:15:11.432 --> 02:15:13.473]  Well, I was there and I saw
[02:15:15.583 --> 02:15:18.825]  The Randy Weavers, the hole up underneath his arm.
[02:15:18.825 --> 02:15:24.248]  I saw his bride, Vicky, laying up under the table in a pool of blood with her face blown off.
[02:15:24.248 --> 02:15:30.331]  And I saw their young adopted son, Harris, laying over there with gangrene in his shoulder.
[02:15:30.331 --> 02:15:38.176]  And I wanted to kill Lon Herucci, the FBI sniper, because he took the witness stand and said he'd do it again, that he'd do everything again.
[02:15:38.883 --> 02:15:44.705]  And so we do have these killers that they do promote up through the ranks today in law enforcement.
[02:15:44.705 --> 02:15:46.346]  That's the sad thing.
[02:15:46.346 --> 02:15:52.469]  The guys on the ground usually are not these hardened court killers, but they follow orders.
[02:15:52.469 --> 02:16:01.933]  And so I spend 24 hours a day almost, it seems like seven days a week educating our police and soldiers here that they should say no to this kind of tyranny.
[02:16:01.933 --> 02:16:02.633]  And we're winning.
[02:16:03.376 --> 02:16:21.134]  We're getting more and more on our side all the time, and so the government wants us to do something to start a war right now with them so that they can shut down the Alex Jones Show, GCN, and shut down Drew Rains Show and my program, and shut down our publications so we cannot
[02:16:21.804 --> 02:16:25.526]  We're having the greatest harvest of souls and minds and intellects ever.
[02:16:39.213 --> 02:16:41.274]  Listen, police, you work for pure evil.
[02:16:41.274 --> 02:16:43.895]  The people running the country, you know it in your gut.
[02:16:43.895 --> 02:16:53.500]  You know it in that same sixth sense that Pastor Butch was talking about back when he was in, you know, Cambodia over the line doing secret ops when they knew an attack was coming and he didn't know why he knew.
[02:16:53.500 --> 02:16:55.461]  Folks, you know your bosses are evil.
[02:16:55.461 --> 02:16:56.221]  You know they're bad.
[02:16:57.221 --> 02:17:01.444]  My God, Halliburton and DynCorp publicly run giant child kidnapping rings.
[02:17:01.444 --> 02:17:03.965]  They put it in the newspaper and they don't get in any trouble.
[02:17:03.965 --> 02:17:04.946]  We're the good guys.
[02:17:04.946 --> 02:17:06.747]  You work for the bad guys.
[02:17:06.747 --> 02:17:10.009]  And it's just getting worse and worse and we don't want to fight with you.
[02:17:10.009 --> 02:17:12.871]  We know it won't hurt the New World Order for us to fight with you.
[02:17:13.800 --> 02:17:17.762]  But we have to defend ourselves, and you just, you keep asking for it.
[02:17:17.762 --> 02:17:22.124]  It's just like, you know, in the Rambo movie, First Blood, where he says, you just keep pushing me.
[02:17:22.124 --> 02:17:30.128]  And I don't think, I mean, how many police and military, Jack, have you talked to of the millions that are out there that are ready to rock and roll if they keep pushing?
[02:17:30.128 --> 02:17:31.348]  Oh my gosh, brother.
[02:17:31.348 --> 02:17:40.052]  For the last 27 years, I've had soldiers and police officers tell me they want to march on water, or Washington, right now.
[02:17:40.052 --> 02:17:43.034]  And I've had to tell them, listen, let us awaken more people.
[02:17:43.797 --> 02:17:58.168]  Let us have the First Amendment a little longer, because the minute we march on Washington or on New Hampshire there at Plainfield, they're going to put us under martial law and they win, because they will cut us off from awakening more people.
[02:17:58.168 --> 02:18:06.434]  There's never been an awakening like this, as you know, Alex, on the face of the earth, of God's people.
[02:18:06.434 --> 02:18:08.676]  Let me keep Drew, let me keep you, we'll bring Butch back up.
[02:18:08.676 --> 02:18:10.177]  We're in the closing minutes of the show.
[02:18:10.177 --> 02:18:13.119]  I'll be popping in on all the shows with reports if people wish that.
[02:18:14.389 --> 02:18:15.511]  On top of all of this,
[02:18:26.619 --> 02:18:32.464]  Going to Aaron Russo, who's in Los Angeles, and we've all been praying for him, battling cancer, but he's here in the fight.
[02:18:32.464 --> 02:18:35.087]  Aaron, now we've got a few minutes.
[02:18:35.087 --> 02:18:37.028]  What's your take on all the things that are happening right now?
[02:18:37.028 --> 02:18:45.596]  You know, your film, America Freedom from Fascism, you know, on the front line in the Info War, exposing what's happening with this criminal organization.
[02:18:45.596 --> 02:18:47.778]  Well, first of all, I just want to say you're doing a great job.
[02:18:47.778 --> 02:18:49.279]  You're a great conductor today, Alex.
[02:18:49.279 --> 02:18:51.602]  You're orchestrating this thing beautifully.
[02:18:51.602 --> 02:18:52.582]  I just want to say that
[02:18:53.792 --> 02:18:57.513]  I think it's very important that everybody remain calm, first of all.
[02:18:57.513 --> 02:19:04.695]  I've gotten more phone calls this morning, and I feel more phone calls from people, you know, passing rumors, spreading this, spreading that.
[02:19:04.695 --> 02:19:07.875]  There's a state of hysteria going on.
[02:19:07.875 --> 02:19:12.036]  And the reason there's a state of hysteria going on is because we're not organized.
[02:19:12.036 --> 02:19:16.737]  And I've been trying to say this, you know, all of a sudden this thing is staring you in the face.
[02:19:16.737 --> 02:19:19.298]  Everybody's been looking at this, knowing it's coming down.
[02:19:19.298 --> 02:19:20.578]  And know what happens?
[02:19:20.578 --> 02:19:23.139]  Everybody's running around like a chicken with their head cut off.
[02:19:23.519 --> 02:19:24.439]  Not knowing what to do.
[02:19:24.439 --> 02:19:25.279]  Aaron, what are we going to do?
[02:19:25.279 --> 02:19:25.800]  What are we going to do?
[02:19:25.800 --> 02:19:27.020]  What are we going to do?
[02:19:27.020 --> 02:19:30.621]  And the point is, you can't decide what you're going to do on the spur of the moment.
[02:19:30.621 --> 02:19:32.981]  You have to be organized in advance.
[02:19:32.981 --> 02:19:36.202]  You have to know who we got, what we got, who we are.
[02:19:36.202 --> 02:19:41.684]  Well, Aaron, I agree with you, but even the mainstream media isn't sure what's going on.
[02:19:41.684 --> 02:19:46.245]  This is the way humans behave, and I agree we need big, organized groups.
[02:19:46.245 --> 02:19:47.185]  You're missing my point.
[02:19:47.185 --> 02:19:49.226]  We also need lots of lone groups, too.
[02:19:49.226 --> 02:19:51.026]  Maybe I'm not making the point clearly enough.
[02:19:51.545 --> 02:19:54.628]  I'm not saying we don't know what's going on in New Hampshire.
[02:19:54.628 --> 02:19:56.270]  We understand that we don't know what's going on.
[02:19:56.270 --> 02:19:58.211]  Don't block it out as much as possible.
[02:19:58.211 --> 02:20:09.342]  But if we're going to have people who believe in freedom and the Constitution are going to react and have a sense of being so we can defend ourselves, then you have to have a control.
[02:20:09.342 --> 02:20:12.645]  You have to have an organization that works.
[02:20:12.645 --> 02:20:13.926]  You have to have an organization that says,
[02:20:14.963 --> 02:20:15.584]  We've got people.
[02:20:15.584 --> 02:20:17.886]  We've got you in New Hampshire.
[02:20:17.886 --> 02:20:19.348]  Get out there now.
[02:20:19.348 --> 02:20:21.550]  You have to be like military precision.
[02:20:21.550 --> 02:20:29.038]  You have to get together, join on a team, get organized, and have headquarters.
[02:20:29.038 --> 02:20:32.141]  So when this stuff comes down, you can deal with it.
[02:20:32.141 --> 02:20:36.165]  Otherwise, you're just a bunch of people running around randomly without any organization.
[02:20:37.023 --> 02:20:37.784]  And it makes no sense.
[02:20:48.394 --> 02:21:11.575]  But we don't know, and again, Listener called in and said that Elaine Brown called into the Ed Brown Show and advised that their house is not on fire, and it appears the authorities have backed off or left, and we hope that is the case, but understand, they moved in, they admitted they shut down the roads, for everybody that just joined us, this is in New Hampshire, they admit they came in, they admit that they were doing all this, and
[02:21:12.055 --> 02:21:12.616]  Hold on, Aaron.
[02:21:12.616 --> 02:21:20.602]  I gotta finish with this report here, because as this stuff comes out, okay, that's what people are tuned in here as we do the news report.
[02:21:20.602 --> 02:21:27.247]  And so, what's happening here is that the Feds have put out the news on Fox 25 that U.S.
[02:21:27.247 --> 02:21:35.894]  Marshals have served a search warrant to seize Brown's dental office, but they admit that they've surrounded the house.
[02:21:35.894 --> 02:21:38.196]  So they're doing that to make everybody back off.
[02:21:38.196 --> 02:21:39.597]  Now, we don't know what the truth is.
[02:21:39.597 --> 02:21:40.778]  We hope they've backed off.
[02:21:41.280 --> 02:21:44.141]  But that's a whole separate argument in and of itself.
[02:21:44.141 --> 02:21:45.442]  I'm discussing something different.
[02:21:45.442 --> 02:21:46.142]  No, I understand, Aaron.
[02:21:46.142 --> 02:21:47.022]  I'm just doing a new show.
[02:21:47.022 --> 02:21:49.223]  I'm here getting the news out of folks.
[02:21:49.223 --> 02:21:50.604]  New stuff just came in.
[02:21:50.604 --> 02:21:52.584]  I'm just trying to make a point.
[02:21:52.584 --> 02:21:59.567]  The whole point of this is, what they could be doing very simply is doing this, seeing who reacts how, who gets the phone calls.
[02:21:59.952 --> 02:22:04.035]  What processes go to work so they can monitor it, and they know what to do next time.
[02:22:04.035 --> 02:22:20.367]  That's what I said in the first hour, is of course this is a laboratory, but it's a laboratory for us to grow all of the grassroots organizations, the conversion of the asymmetrical warfare of the lone wolf, media, info war, physical, whatever, is the unstoppable.
[02:22:20.367 --> 02:22:23.689]  That way there's not one head to cut off, Aaron.
[02:22:23.689 --> 02:22:27.872]  I agree with that, but you have to have an organization.
[02:22:28.468 --> 02:22:30.259]  And you have to have many heads there.
[02:22:30.259 --> 02:22:31.003]  That's the point.
[02:22:31.003 --> 02:22:31.989]  If you're not organized...
[02:22:32.358 --> 02:22:35.080]  Yeah, you're just a bunch of guys running around.
[02:22:35.080 --> 02:22:36.861]  Aaron, what are we going to do?
[02:22:36.861 --> 02:22:38.923]  I understand, but I want to be positive on the air.
[02:22:38.923 --> 02:22:39.864]  Aaron, I appreciate it.
[02:22:39.864 --> 02:22:41.605]  I'll talk to you during the break.
[02:22:41.605 --> 02:22:44.027]  We're about to go to break here, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:22:44.027 --> 02:22:48.670]  We're here on air, ladies and gentlemen, talking about the Ed and Elaine Brown case.
[02:22:48.670 --> 02:22:52.393]  And we've heard from many of the co-hosts of the show that Ed and Elaine Brown were doing.
[02:22:52.393 --> 02:22:54.835]  We've heard from people in New Hampshire.
[02:22:54.835 --> 02:22:58.117]  We have heard from Jack McClam, who called to talk to the Sheriff's Office.
[02:22:58.117 --> 02:22:59.058]  We've heard from Pastor Butch.
[02:22:59.859 --> 02:23:02.581]  Uh, Paul, who has also been giving us reports.
[02:23:02.581 --> 02:23:04.744]  We've been covering the news here.
[02:23:04.744 --> 02:23:07.807]  We're going to come back in the final segment.
[02:23:07.807 --> 02:23:14.594]  And everybody needs to converge there peacefully to cover this as a show of support.
[02:23:14.594 --> 02:23:15.735]  Also, tonight, 7 o'clock,
[02:23:17.350 --> 02:23:20.913]  Texas Governor's Mansion, right off 11th Street, right by the Capitol.
[02:23:20.913 --> 02:23:25.036]  I'm going to be there 7 to 8, one hour, saying no more Waco's.
[02:23:25.036 --> 02:23:27.077]  Believe me, call the press, tell them to be there.
[02:23:27.077 --> 02:23:32.441]  That's the type of news the feds will want to see is multi-state, far away demonstrations happening.
[02:23:32.441 --> 02:23:36.224]  We'll see at the Governor's Mansion also protesting his Bilderberg Group moves.
[02:23:36.224 --> 02:23:40.447]  We'll come back with final comments from Aaron Russo, Jack McClan, Pastor Bush.
[02:23:40.447 --> 02:23:40.907]  Stay with me.
[02:23:46.144 --> 02:23:46.825]  It's here.
[02:23:46.825 --> 02:23:51.968]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:23:51.968 --> 02:23:59.593]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:24:00.313 --> 02:24:07.755]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:24:07.755 --> 02:24:19.478]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:24:19.478 --> 02:24:23.459]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:24:23.459 --> 02:24:25.700]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:24:25.700 --> 02:24:29.561]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:24:42.935 --> 02:24:47.739]  The Berkey Security Pack is your one-stop solution for unexpected emergencies.
[02:24:47.739 --> 02:24:52.382]  It provides you with purified water, light, power, and communications ability.
[02:24:52.382 --> 02:25:06.393]  The Security Pack includes a Berkey Light Water Purifier, an LED Base, two Berkey Sport Filtration Bottles, the Berkey Battery Adapter, the Berkey MP Solar Charger, as well as a backup set of two Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[02:25:06.613 --> 02:25:23.609]  The Berkey Security Pack is important every day and a must during emergencies because it provides purified water, long-term low-energy lighting, backup battery power for your Berkey LEDs, free long-term solar power for communications devices such as radios, walkie-talkies, and cell phones.
[02:25:23.609 --> 02:25:23.929]  I think so.
[02:25:42.737 --> 02:25:44.678]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:25:44.678 --> 02:25:48.720]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[02:25:48.720 --> 02:25:57.804]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions, credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more, all in the hands of a total stranger.
[02:25:57.804 --> 02:26:02.906]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door because you left it unlocked.
[02:26:02.906 --> 02:26:04.667]  Every time you walk away from your computer,
[02:26:04.667 --> 02:26:05.267]  We're good to go.
[02:26:21.661 --> 02:26:21.921]  I think so.
[02:26:45.331 --> 02:26:56.615]  The preacher man says it's the end of time, in the Mississippi River she's a-goin' dry.
[02:26:56.615 --> 02:27:02.617]  The interest is up and the stock market's down, and you only get mugged if you go downtown.
[02:27:08.258 --> 02:27:31.961]  I live back in the woods, you see A woman and the kids and the dogs and me I got a shotgun, a rifle and a four-wheel drive And a country boy can survive Country folks can survive And this is dedicated to Ed and Elaine Brown, this song right now
[02:27:32.754 --> 02:27:34.596]  Just gonna play a minute or so more, go back to our guests.
[02:27:55.558 --> 02:28:01.802]  We grow good old tomatoes and homemade wine and country boy can survive.
[02:28:01.802 --> 02:28:06.564]  Country folks can survive.
[02:28:06.564 --> 02:28:13.408]  Because you can't starve us out and you can't make us run.
[02:28:13.408 --> 02:28:16.110]  Cause when them old boys raised on shotgun.
[02:28:16.110 --> 02:28:19.572]  We say great, we say man.
[02:28:25.356 --> 02:28:35.479]  Alright, final segment, continual coverage throughout the day on Genesis, continual streams at InfoWars.com, and I'll be on with Jack tonight, I'll be on with Pastor Butch tonight.
[02:28:35.479 --> 02:28:39.540]  We've got the Governor's number here for you, call it right now.
[02:28:39.540 --> 02:28:42.641]  This is Government John, what's his name?
[02:28:42.641 --> 02:28:44.242]  I was scribbling it down so fast, Butch.
[02:28:45.023 --> 02:28:47.504]  John Lynch, and the phone number is 603-271-2121.
[02:28:47.504 --> 02:28:47.704]  That's 603-271-2121.
[02:28:47.704 --> 02:28:49.084]  His fax number is 7680.
[02:28:49.084 --> 02:28:50.044]  Same first number?
[02:28:50.044 --> 02:28:50.865]  1603-271-2121 or 7680 at the end.
[02:28:50.865 --> 02:28:54.245]  Closing comments, you've got 45 seconds, then Jack McClam.
[02:29:11.930 --> 02:29:14.492]  All I can say is, folks, I hope that the news is true.
[02:29:14.492 --> 02:29:15.873]  I hope they'll back down.
[02:29:15.873 --> 02:29:17.915]  But be as it may, we must unite.
[02:29:17.915 --> 02:29:18.796]  We must organize.
[02:29:18.796 --> 02:29:19.356]  It's time.
[02:29:19.356 --> 02:29:21.918]  We cannot wait another week, another month.
[02:29:21.918 --> 02:29:26.322]  We must organize now and decide that we're willing to die for the cause.
[02:29:26.322 --> 02:29:28.123]  And no more Mamby Pambying.
[02:29:28.123 --> 02:29:29.304]  Let's do something about this.
[02:29:29.304 --> 02:29:35.129]  PrisonPlanet.com and JonesReport.com are the two sites that I'm going to have 24-hour-a-day coverage on this today.
[02:29:36.209 --> 02:29:41.091]  Again, PleasantPlanet.com and JonesReport.com right now.
[02:29:41.091 --> 02:29:45.152]  Those are my two sites that have the most coverage on this.
[02:29:45.152 --> 02:29:48.973]  Thank you, Butch, and I'm going to join you via ISDN tonight, okay?
[02:29:48.973 --> 02:29:49.873]  See you tonight, okay.
[02:29:49.873 --> 02:29:50.953]  Fantastic.
[02:29:50.953 --> 02:29:52.414]  Help you bring in the reports.
[02:29:52.414 --> 02:29:54.554]  Jack McClam, you've got the final word here.
[02:29:54.554 --> 02:29:55.314]  Okay, brother.
[02:29:55.314 --> 02:29:57.695]  Thank you for coming on with me tonight.
[02:29:57.695 --> 02:30:03.117]  We really need to hit this hard, and I just want to say I've missed you, Aaron Russo.
[02:30:03.117 --> 02:30:04.857]  We haven't talked to each other in years.
[02:30:05.379 --> 02:30:11.102]  I remember when you kissed me on the cheek there at the Preparedness Expo.
[02:30:11.102 --> 02:30:12.323]  I want to talk to you, brother.
[02:30:12.323 --> 02:30:13.463]  Give me a call, would you?
[02:30:13.463 --> 02:30:17.165]  And listen, we're praying for you all the time for your cancer.
[02:30:17.165 --> 02:30:17.665]  Absolutely.
[02:30:17.665 --> 02:30:21.167]  Aaron is going to, if he feels good, I'm going to have him on tomorrow.
[02:30:21.167 --> 02:30:26.310]  He's now gone, so he can fully flesh out what he was trying to say there with me, hyperventilating.
[02:30:26.310 --> 02:30:27.690]  So much is happening, Jack.
[02:30:27.690 --> 02:30:30.172]  Number one, we need to pray for the Browns right now.
[02:30:30.172 --> 02:30:33.913]  Number two, I think it's safe, Jack, to at least send people there to show numbers.
[02:30:33.913 --> 02:30:34.694]  We should do that, right?
[02:30:35.353 --> 02:30:56.262]  Well, you know, I've been involved in this business a long time and if you send them in there non-violently, tell them to watch for the undercover guys coming in to shoot the police officers from their crowds and they jump on them and they take their guns away from them if they try to cause violence because that's what they'll try to do.
[02:30:56.262 --> 02:30:56.942]  Absolutely.
[02:30:57.825 --> 02:30:59.347]  We know they love it.
[02:30:59.347 --> 02:31:01.629]  Jack, we'll have you back on tomorrow as this develops.
[02:31:01.629 --> 02:31:03.130]  Thank you so much, my friend.
[02:31:03.130 --> 02:31:03.491]  Okay.
[02:31:03.491 --> 02:31:04.652]  God bless you, Alex.
[02:31:04.652 --> 02:31:08.296]  We'll have links to their shows tonight so you can hear when I'm on there with them.
[02:31:08.296 --> 02:31:10.237]  And no doubt I'll probably be on Coast to Coast tonight.
[02:31:10.237 --> 02:31:10.498]  Who knows?
[02:31:10.498 --> 02:31:11.098]  They'll probably call.
[02:31:11.098 --> 02:31:12.800]  I was on there last night.
[02:31:12.800 --> 02:31:20.548]  As we continue to cover the really important news, the things that really matter, pray for Edna Lane Brown right now and pray for Luke Rodowski going into the sector.
