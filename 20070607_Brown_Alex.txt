[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.000]  WCAX TV, and I got a bunch of calls about this, and I wasn't taking them serious, I was trying to make phone calls, and then Bermas was telling me about it, so I trust Bermas I was taking that serious, and I was unable to confirm it, but I didn't want to go on air with it.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000]  SWAT Teams Armored Vehicle Senior Brown Compound WCAX.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000]  Now watch, if nothing happens, I'll be blamed for this, not WCAX TV.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:38.000]  They'll edit it, folks. People will edit this, and they'll try to twist, but just later, and I won't have time to defend myself, but I hope to God they're not raiding them.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:56.000]  Everybody needs to get over there, and we need to, you know, peaceably stand in the way of this happening, and if they start pulling another Waco, trying to just machine gun into the place, then we need to have citizens arrested, these criminals, these armored goons that just engage in criminal activity.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:04.000]  We need the governor to block the feds from doing this, we need the county sheriff to tell these are feds doing this, that they don't have jurisdiction.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000]  This is just absolutely criminal.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:18.000]  Neighbors of convicted tax evaders, Ed and Elaine Brown reported, police SWAT teams and at least one armored vehicle converged on a field near the Browns Plainfield, New Hampshire home this morning.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:26.000]  See, I would have loved to have been able to tell you this off rumors, but we tried to make calls, and now I feel guilty for that. I just can't win.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.000]  Federal and state authorities haven't commented on whether they are moving in to arrest the fugitives. That means they are, but that means they probably are.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:44.000]  And the local police, the governor's office, and the U.S. attorney's office referred calls to the U.S. marshal's office, which has been negotiating with the Browns since their tax evasion conviction.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000]  We need to get a map of his house, I know we already have that, of where he's at, get it up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.000]  We need to get this article up there, and we need to try to get Ed Brown on.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000]  But again, his line's been cut, but I thought, well maybe, I haven't talked to him in a few weeks, maybe he changed phone numbers.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.000]  So I was busy calling RBN that he's affiliated with, Public Broadcasting Network, to try to find out, and we're busy doing that.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000]  Do we have any word on that yet?
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:27.000]  A neighbor who lives a mile or so away from the Browns, on center of town roads that she saw police officers, SWAT team members, a fire truck ambulance, helicopter, and at least one armored vehicle assembled in a field across from her driveway.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:37.000]  Brown told a blog interviewer this morning he's been getting calls from people reporting police in the town, and said he lost power twice during the night.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:46.000]  The Browns had been sentenced to five and a half years in tax evasion, they skipped their sentencing hearings, and Ed Brown said he and his wife will refuse to surrender.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:56.000]  God bless them, poor people man, pray for them, it may already be over, or the feds may back off, I don't know, we're trying to cover it here.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:04.000]  I want to thank those that did call here and tell me of the rumors, those are now semi-confirmed, I hope it's not true, from the AP.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:14.000]  A little mini Alamo may be taking place right now, we'll be right back ladies and gentlemen, we'll try to learn more.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:24.000]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:33.000]  We would all love to live in a world with clean air and water, a world in which our produce is grown naturally, without the use of pesticides and other harmful chemicals.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:45.000]  But the truth is, we don't live in such a world. These toxins enter our bodies, and the organ in our body that works hard to eliminate these toxins is the liver, which is one of the most complex and important organs in the human body.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:59.000]  With more than 500 vital functions, give your liver the helping hand it needs with Live52, the world's best-selling all-natural liver support formula in over 76 countries, and it's backed by over 300 clinical trials and studies.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:07.000]  Live52 is the most researched herbal formula that helps neutralize toxins from food, water, air, alcohol, and prescription medications.

[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:24.000]  That's research-herbs.com, or call 1-800-973-1482, and tell them Alex Jones sent you.

[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:31.000]  People who use Cartevite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out. For over five years, Cartevite has proven itself time-tested.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cartevite.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:44.000]  In our minds, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore. This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:54.000]  When we do our program, you know, herbal formulas like Cartevite, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill now going for a regular job a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:01.000]  It's a well-thought-out formula. I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:07.000]  You'll find, I think, that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems. It'll work on other problems as well.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:23.000]  For more information, call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com. That toll-free number again? 1-877-928-8822.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:58.000]  There must be some kind of way out of here, said a joker to the thief. There's too much confusion. I can't get no relief.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:10.000]  Ed Brown was just a mainline guy paying his quote taxes. Then the government raided him, beat him up. I'm really paraphrasing and trying to condense it down. It happened repeatedly.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:17.000]  Tried to claim they had weapons. Tried to claim they were a threat. Beat him up in the courtroom. Just all, you know, the normal stuff they do.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:28.000]  They're criminals. Criminals run the country and most of them are so psychopathic they don't even know they're criminals. They think it's just their right to feed on us.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:36.000]  They just got sick of it and he said, you know what, I'm just going to sit here in my house. He said, I'm not going to pay all the money you claim I owe, even though they had it to pay.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:46.000]  They just said, come kill us. We're going to fight you. Just come on. And then the feds did what they always did with the Indianapolis Baptist Temple and they stole that and took that church and all the other things they've done.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:55.000]  They wait six months, a year. They wait until everybody forgets about it. They wait until the crowds leave. They wait until everybody backs off and then they come in.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:06.000]  This may even be SWAT team training in the neighborhood. This may even be them as a probing move to see, to test the response of the American people.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:18.000]  Or it may already be over. We don't know. Anyone that is in Plainfield, New Hampshire, the live free or die state, where they now arrest reporters for asking questions.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:27.000]  That's why that story is so important because it just shows the police state we're living in and what Matt and Luke and others went through.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:37.000]  The live free or die, the Patrick Henry state, SWAT teams, armored vehicles seen near Brown compound.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:47.000]  And it says Brown told a blog interviewer this morning he'd been getting calls. Okay, blog interviewer, whoever you are, the mainstream media will never source the alternative media.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:53.000]  They'll tell you what they said and use their reporting but never, because they're in competition with us, they realize we're destroying them.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:00.000]  They'll never give you a link so you can actually find out what really happened. So I'm getting all these calls at the office. I don't know who's who.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:07.000]  We're overwhelmed here. Just call in, not on any other issue right now, not on immigration, not on Ron Paul and the debate being rigged.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:16.000]  We've got that news confirmed. Not on Luke and others being, and Matt being grabbed by the state police in New Hampshire.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:25.000]  That's all coming up later. Not on the CPS grabbing a 9-11 truther's child. That's coming up.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:33.000]  Right now it's Ed Brown. And I'm asking you, the listeners, specifically if you know, specifically if you talk to Ed Brown.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:41.000]  I know a lot of you talk to him. Specifically the blogs. I know Luke and others, if they had time in New Hampshire, were going to interview Ed Brown.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.000]  I don't know if they did that. I never asked. Maybe we need to get Luke on the line.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:52.000]  My poor producer, I'm in there shouting 15 orders at him during the break because it's just too much going on. I'm trying to make phone calls.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.000]  I'm just letting you know where we're at right now. Help us. Find out. Do you live in New Hampshire? Do you live nearby?
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:04.000]  Get on your cell phone. Drive by Ed's house. You're an hour away. Don't wait. Get in your car. Start driving over there right now.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:11.000]  And the feds may be doing this on purpose to cry wolf a couple times, to do these drills a couple times.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000]  And so the third time, just like with the Indianapolis temple, the fourth time, they'll go ahead and move in.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:24.000]  They may have cut his line and cut his power. That's what this sounds like as a psyop. They cut his power twice, cut his phone line.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:31.000]  They've done this in land grabs too, messing with him. So he'll put out the alarm so when he finally does put it out, you don't respond.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:38.000]  That could be what's happening. Or Ed and Elaine Brown could have already been SWAT teamed. It runs the gamut.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:48.000]  It runs the gamut from the SWAT team was doing drills a mile from his house and people saw it and it's the local college or the local city or county.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:56.000]  Or it could be that it's the feds getting ready to move in or they've already moved in and there's already been a firefight.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:05.000]  We don't know. That's why, and I don't live in New Hampshire, if I'd have known a day before, a week before, I'd have got on a plane and gone up there.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:13.000]  I know many of you have. We've sent Infowars.com reporters there before. We've interviewed Ed. Back when all this started breaking, what, a year ago.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:28.000]  But the point is, Ed Brown, Elaine Brown, making a stand for the American people saying this far and no further, give me liberty or give me death in the give me liberty or give me death state, New Hampshire.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:40.000]  This is huge. This is history happening if this indeed is taking place. Now again, my enemies are going to take the last five minutes and edit it.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:51.000]  I'm reading this. I'm covering this from WCAX-TV News 3. We knew about this before showtime. I started getting calls this morning.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:12:02.000]  I tried to confirm it. I couldn't. I didn't know the people that were calling me. I tried to call Ed. I'd heard false alarms before and then Burmish called me.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:12.000]  I don't know what's going on. I just know that this is in the news and this looks like something could be happening.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:26.000]  1-800-259-9231. 1-800-259-9231. John Harmon up in Minnesota running things, answering the phones, literally like an octopus doing the job of three people.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:32.000]  Have you gotten any calls yet, people specifically who talked to Ed today or yesterday or who are in the nearby area?
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000]  I've got a call from Fred Smart.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:47.000]  Okay, Fred Smart. Yes, I've heard Fred on the air, I believe. Fred Smart. Call Fred Smart right now, please. Let's get him on the line.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:54.000]  I may have to push back the father who's had his son kidnapped because he dared have a 9-11 truth sign.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:05.000]  I'm telling you, folks, it's like I'm in a lifeboat with millions of hands reaching up. Just walk a mile in our shoes and that's what makes me so angry.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:15.000]  That's what makes me so aggressive. People don't understand it. They hear the passion and they get confused. They think I'm either nuts or I'm an egomaniac.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:21.000]  No, it's because I'm in life and death mode here, folks. I know the cost, okay? I'm fired up.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000]  Let's go to Fred Smart. Fred Smart, where are you today?
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000]  Hey, Alex. I'm here in Chicago.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:35.000]  Okay, you know Ed Brown well. Tell us basically about yourself real quick so we know who you are and then give us the latest.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:46.000]  Well, real quick, we have, myself and a bunch of people, once we heard about Ed and Elaine early January, got the word out, e-mail, blogs, whatever,
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:57.000]  and we've been doing a daily show on Republic, getting their voice out. Got a call early this morning from Elaine. She had left a message as early as 6 o'clock my time.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:06.000]  Reno, who is a decorated Desert Storm veteran, was staying with them while his belongings were at the house, went to walk the dog early.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000]  Forty-five minutes later, the dog came back. Reno never came back.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:23.000]  Within the same half hour, Ed got a call and some friends in South Lebanon along the road had noticed several armed personnel carriers were heading south toward Plainfield.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:36.000]  So they still had communications. We got a couple of lobby blogs going, an hour conference call, a few people called in, sent out some e-mails, tried to encourage other people to send out e-mails.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:41.000]  I just tried calling their line. Their line has been disconnected now officially.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:53.000]  So we have no communication with them other than if they were on the internet, I would presume they have a satellite connection, but I'm sure they're not staring at their computer right now.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:15:01.000]  So we have a couple of people driving there and hopefully there's going to be more intelligence on what's really happening.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:07.000]  Okay, I want you to again repeat everything you just said with any other details that you left out.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:18.000]  Take your time, Fred Smart, who again has been co-hosting a show on the Republic Network with Ed Brown the last four or five months, I guess it was six months.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:24.000]  Tell us exactly, slowly, when you first got the call, what Ed said, word for word.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:34.000]  Go back and just flesh it out as we debrief you here. Just really think about exactly what Ed said because every piece of intel, as you know, is very important.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:44.000]  Well, I was on my way to drive my son to school and I gave Elaine a call just out of the blue.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:52.000]  Something told me to call and I got up strangely early this morning. I felt something was up and I wasn't even thinking of Ed and Elaine.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000]  But then I got in the car and Elaine said, Fred, I've been trying to call you, trying to call you.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000]  And we got a high alert situation and I said, what's going on?
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:06.000]  She said, well, Reno left to walk the dog. Forty-five minutes later, the dog came back and Reno didn't come back.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:19.000]  And we've since gotten word that some friends have spotted several armed personnel carriers with troops heading on the main highway toward Plainfield.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:28.000]  By troops, I mean they look like regular Army or Marines or they're just dressed up in the regular terrorist enforcer outfits?
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:37.000]  All I know it was just, he used some terminology, FTVs or AF, it was just, I don't know the lingo.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:45.000]  APCs, Armored Personnel Carrier. Then there's LAVs, Light Armored Vehicles. LAVs, APCs.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:57.000]  It wasn't an LAV. And on top of that, Ed said that yesterday a Cessna did a couple of flybys mid-afternoon.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:13.000]  And then at night around 8, 39 o'clock their time, a completely silent drone with a very high beam light circled their property at that time.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:18.000]  And it's fun for these guys. Most of these guys are into hunting, which I'm not saying is a bad thing.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:24.000]  But to them, I mean I've seen videos of the cops behind the scenes, especially with patriots, they love killing us.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:30.000]  And especially children at Waco, literally they celebrate, hold up skulls of dead babies, it's real fun.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:38.000]  And it's a big hunting trip. They're chewing tobacco and they go to the topless bar the night before and it's high-fives and all their gear.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:44.000]  It's hunting humans. It's a lot of fun. This is so sick. And I want them all to know it's the Alamo.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:51.000]  And every one of them that takes part in this criminal raid is going to be known as a traitor forever.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:57.000]  But don't worry about the American people. You've got God just guaranteed to curse you for what you're doing.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:04.000]  But this is the Alamo. This is happening. Please could you tell us about this, what Ed said about this drone?
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:09.000]  Okay, Ed just said it was strange. It was completely silent.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.000]  This was at night?
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:17.000]  It was at night. It cruised in the air overhead with a bright, bright beaming light.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:29.000]  Can't put it on the border. By the way, they're going to give all the illegal aliens, this is in the bill, total tax amnesty, literal pardons on all their back taxes.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:36.000]  But not Ed and Elaine Brown? Boy, they've got to be taken out. What time did this happen?
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:41.000]  The drone was spotted 8.30, 9 o'clock their time.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:50.000]  It was toward the dust side and there were a lot of trees around the area. They had open space.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:19:02.000]  It was really strange. Yesterday my phone has gone out several times in the last 24 hours, which has never ever happened with that frequency.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:12.000]  Another gentleman was on the show with Ed and Elaine yesterday. Obviously they will not be on the show today.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:21.000]  We did hear word from RBN that they were going to be cut back to just Saturday for two hours versus five days a week.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:28.000]  That's a whole programming discussion. The main thing right now is what's happening to them. That's what's important here.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:33.000]  Let's just be clear here and walk through all of this.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:41.000]  So that happened at 8.30. Now understand, at Waco and Ruby Ridge and other places they're called laboratories, war fighting laboratories.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:47.000]  They bring in Israelis, Russians. That's Newsweek by the way for listeners that just joined us and think that I'm joking.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:58.000]  That's mainstream news. I guarantee you this is going to be a laboratory. They're going to have all sorts of gadgets and horrible little bloody inventions out there.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:05.000]  The main thing is who do you have in contact locally, liaisons locally that can drive by the house. That's the key.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:13.000]  Well I put in a couple phone calls and some other people have put in phone calls. I talked with two people.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:23.000]  There's a volunteer gentleman from Missouri and myself and a guy from Vermont who is driving on his way about an hour's drive, 45 minutes to an hour's drive.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:30.000]  Another gentleman in New Hampshire was not aware of the situation very close to the rounds. He said he'd be heading right up there.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:41.000]  They both have cell phones. I would say within the next 15, 20 minutes there should be some reconnaissance and information from them forthcoming.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:53.000]  The only other people, hopefully people are getting the word out by email and some people can, I don't know if they're cordoned off the highways and the roads around the house.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:58.000]  Well I know people had pledged to always keep certain numbers there. Well that will confirm it right there.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:09.000]  If you try to get within a half mile of the house and there's some goons out there waddling around with an armored vehicle or an armored truck, you know that they're there and you know it's going down.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:20.000]  Ed didn't have three or four disposable cell phones where they didn't know all the phones he had because that's what I advised him to do a long time ago.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:28.000]  Yeah. If he does, I don't know if they've been jammed yet. I don't have any other number to call.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:41.000]  Fred, give us your blog or give us any other good blogs. Are you the blogger that the Plainfield Associated Press talked to?
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:49.000]  Well, we've had several people maintain the blog. I'm one of them. I started it with another gentleman.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:57.000]  I'm just trying to find out who the AP, because this is unjournalistic to cite a blog and then not show the blog.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:05.000]  And again, I'm not mad about the AP being a bunch of scumbags and mainstream. I just want to know who it was because they're not engaged in journalistic activity here.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.000]  Yeah, I'm not aware of what you're talking about there.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:13.000]  Well, we need to find out who this local blog is. We need to find out who these eyewitnesses are. We need them to call in right now.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:25.000]  John, have we had anybody else call in on the 1-800-259-9231 number who's nearby or is in New Hampshire or in Plainfield?
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000]  Just unbelievable.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:33.000]  Alex, it's interesting. Do you know what today's date is? Is it in history?
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.000]  No.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000]  1967.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.000]  Okay. Just to refresh my memory, what happened in 1967?
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000]  This is when the Six-Day War began.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:50.000]  Oh, it is. And then the 40th anniversary of the Liberty is coming up in just a few days.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:58.000]  Yep. So this is all 40 years later. Just kind of interesting.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000]  Amazing.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:13.000]  Ed and Elaine are just wonderful people. They're peaceful. They're civil. Yes, Ed has a rough edge to him, but my God, they are true blue American patriots.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:18.000]  Well, this is horrible news. I mean, it's in the Associated Press that people are saying this.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:24.000]  Why doesn't the lazy AP, this is huge news, get in their vehicles and drive over there?
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.000]  This is what we need to do. Everybody needs to do this for me because we don't have the staff.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:33.000]  We're going to try to call the Plainfield TV stations, Plainfield radio stations, get the radio to go out there.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:39.000]  In fact, let me tell my producer, please go Google the Plainfield AM talk station.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.000]  Call them and say, are you going down here to cover what could be one of the biggest stories of the year?
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:49.000]  Get over there and cover this. People's lives are in the balance. This could be a new Waco we're talking about.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.000]  Who knows what could have already happened, or it could just be a drill.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:59.000]  You know, the feds do try to test things and see who's in the woodwork, see who may be in that area.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.000]  What do you think is going on? I mean, bottom line.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:11.000]  Cameras and video cameras and just the biggest thing is to provide some transparency and accountability in the form of recording what they witness, what they see.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:16.000]  Fred Smart, stay there. I want to come back and ask you where you think all this is going, what your gut is.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:22.000]  I mean, if they're cutting his phones and cut his power and he saw drones, it doesn't look good. We'll be right back.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:33.000]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling the distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:41.000]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:49.000]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:25:01.000]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information and much, much more.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:07.000]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism. It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:11.000]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:27:43.000 --> 00:28:12.000]  Welcome back, Art.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000]  We've got breaking news here.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.000]  Police assembled by Brown's home.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.000]  Another article here.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000]  This is out of the Union Leader newspaper.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:27.000]  Let's get the Union Leader reporter Pat Rothschmidt and Kristen Sins on.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.000]  It's definitely on, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:34.000]  There's definitely something going on there and I'm sorry we were cautious at the start of the show.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.000]  We have to do that here.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:41.000]  I'm actually extremely cautious with what we cover and of course we always get blamed with doing the opposite.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.000]  Dozens of heavily armed state police and federal agents have assembled.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.000]  It is confirmed, confirmed, confirmed, confirmed.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.000]  It's up on PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:54.000]  Dozens of heavily armed, and stay with us Fred Smart, I want to bring you back up.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.000]  Let me get this article out.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:04.000]  Dozens of heavily armed state police and federal agents have assembled near the rural Grafton County home of tax protester Ed and Elaine Brown.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:11.000]  About 50 state troopers, some armed with high powered rifles, the state working with the globalist private IRS,
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:16.000]  along with a vehicle from an explosives unit, oh that's so they can imply they've got bombs,
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:22.000]  gathered this morning in Plainfield, a town where Ed and Elaine Brown have been holed up in their home
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:27.000]  since being convicted of tax evasion and sentencing to leak the federal prison sentences.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:31.000]  The Browns have been aware of the increased police activity all morning.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:38.000]  An audio file posted on a blog this morning, he said a silent aircraft at about 5,000 feet,
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:43.000]  notice they don't ever give credit to, that's just normal, you're supposed to link to your source.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.000]  No, they just take it.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.000]  That is total journalistic scammery.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.000]  And again, it isn't about who gets the credit, it's that we need that info.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.000]  We want to go to the original source.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.000]  That's why you're supposed to do it.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000]  That's what we do in our articles.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000]  You're supposed to source them by name.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000]  You're unbelievable, you scum.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.000]  I don't know if the editor wouldn't let them do it or I don't know if it's the writers that are scum.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.000]  The Browns have been aware of increased police activity all morning.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:15.000]  An audio file posted on a blog this morning, he said a silent aircraft at about 50,000 feet,
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.000]  and the air flew over his home overnight.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:28.000]  And he said at about 7.45 a.m. this morning, a visiting friend took a dog out for a walk but never returned.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.000]  They may just be listening to the show.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:32.000]  The dog, he said, came running up the driveway about an hour later.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:39.000]  He also said a neighbor called at 8.45 to let him know that two and one-half dozen state troopers were coming down Route 12A,
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.000]  heading in his direction.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.000]  Interesting that fellow slipped off.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000]  Did they grab him or did he know when to go?
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.000]  Who knows? We'll find out later.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:55.000]  But Browns were convicted in January in U.S. District Court in Concord for not paying more than $500,000 in taxes.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:01.000]  Do you remember how there was the BATF, I've met him, I know him, I forget his name, a Hispanic officer.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.000]  He was crying, saying, why'd you kill everybody, why'd you open fire?
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:08.000]  He came out mad throwing fits, you know, when they went ahead and just opened fire and attacked.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.000]  And he was saying, why, why? He could have picked Koresh up in town.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000]  Remember that?
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:17.000]  Maybe they grabbed this guy, he's probably a great guy, but we have to ask ourselves, why did he slip off?
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:22.000]  We have to ask that, it's a classic M.O. to...
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.000]  The Browns were convicted in January in U.S. District Court in Concord for not paying $500,000.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:32.000]  The union leader, correspondent, was kept away from the Browns compound by state police, who would not say why.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.000]  That is confirmed, that shit is what we were asking for.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.000]  Reporters went out there and were kept away.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.000]  Boom, it's on, period.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.000]  God knows what these criminals have done.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.000]  God knows what they've done to these people.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:51.000]  It's on, with that line, you can bank it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:56.000]  The state police kept Pat Grossmith and Kristen Sins away.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000]  This is outrageous, that's it.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:02.000]  They are definitely surrounded at the bare minimum.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.000]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNLive.com.

[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.000]  That's why the media won't link to it.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:05.000]  And you can find out all the basics there. Quest for a Fair Trial.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:11.000]  Edna Lane Brown. It'll come up. We'll get all the links up. They're already going up. All the latest at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:24.000]  For those that don't know, Pat Grossman and Kristen Sins have reported for the union leader at a Plainfield, New Hampshire, that the state police turned them back.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:29.000]  Union leader correspondent was kept away from the Browns' compound, their house. It's always called a compound.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:33.000]  See, they don't want to say home. This is all psychological warfare.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:38.000]  Okay? They don't want to say home. They've got to dehumanize that because you'll associate with your home.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:43.000]  Sheed the enemy's crafting.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:47.000]  Now, union leader correspondent was kept away from the Browns' compound.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.000]  See, when they come to kill you, your house is called a compound.
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:56.000]  I've heard them call apartments compounds by state police, really federal police, they don't know it, who would not say why.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:00.000]  Well, we know why. They're going to have a big party. A killing party.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:05.000]  Let's pray for the Browns right now, folks, if they haven't already been engaged by the New Orleans forces.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:10.000]  Susan Williams, who lives a mile or so away from the Browns on Center of Town Road,
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:15.000]  said she saw police officers, SWAT team members, a fire truck, ambulance, helicopter,
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.000]  and at least one armored vehicle assembled in a field across from her driveway.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000]  We confirmed that an hour ago.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:27.000]  Now we are confirming that they have been turned away. They are bare minimum surrounded.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.000]  Okay?
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.000]  And again, what do you type into Google to find the blog?
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.000]  I've got their blog here in front of me, but what's the best web search for people?
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.000]  Fred Smart, Friends of the Browns?
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:44.000]  Actually, Alex, there's another site that a friend just typed in.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:48.000]  They have a live video feed on everything going on there.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:56.000]  If you'll just take a patient here, it's Topix, T-O-P-I-X dot net.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.000]  Okay, I'm going to...
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.000]  Tell you what, stop. Don't give it out. Don't give it out.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.000]  You know why? Because we need to get this feed.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.000]  Guys, get a video camera because we don't have the coupling software.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.000]  Go to this site. I'm going to get it off there. Folks, don't search it. Don't find it yet.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:23.000]  If everybody goes to it, it will crash it just like the feed from New Hampshire with the debates.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:27.000]  I'm telling you. That's why I didn't even want to plug it when Luke did the other day
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:30.000]  because I knew it would crash it because they were using a free service.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.000]  Don't give it out.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:38.000]  Again, I'm doing this because if we give it out, literally 100,000 people are going to go on it.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.000]  Right now, it will crash and we'll lose the feed.
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:45.000]  I wish I should have got on infrastructure and bought them a server or something.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:48.000]  I can't do it all. Let me get my guys in here right now.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.000]  I'm going to put you on hold. Give the address right now to John Harmon,
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:55.000]  and he's going to IM it over to my crew here.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:09.000]  Guys, I need you guys to get in here and get a video camera on the feed so we can at least document that
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:14.000]  and then we can try to rig it up for some type of live stream here off of our servers.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:18.000]  I've been trying to get three more big servers because I know this kind of stuff is coming up,
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:21.000]  but we've got servers right now. We've got some backup servers.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:26.000]  I need my IT people to get in here now if they're not busy doing other stuff,
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.000]  and we need to get all this rigged up. We should have had this rigged up before.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.000]  Or you know what? I guess I'll just give their address out.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:37.000]  Folks, should I give the address out and end the link where we don't know what's happening?
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.000]  Or do you want us to have the link?
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:43.000]  Now everybody's going to spread it all over the web already. It's over.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.000]  Okay, let me just stop there.
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:49.000]  When we come back, we will ask him what we're seeing off the live feed.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:56.000]  It looks like, thank God, they haven't moved in yet, and we will try to find out what's happening there.
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:00.000]  This is huge. This is all happening right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:06.000]  Ed and Elaine Brown, falsely charged, robbed by the Private Federal Reserves Collection Agency,
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:09.000]  gone through living hell, now facing this.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.000]  I'm Alex Jones, and we'll be right back on the other side.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:16.000]  We're going to try to rig something up as best we can.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:22.000]  I don't know if we have the skills to try to get a jump feed off this and re-up it.
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:33.000]  It's here. After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:38.000]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:41.000]  against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:45.000]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job,
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:49.000]  but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:52.000]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq,
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:58.000]  a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture,
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:01.000]  the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:05.000]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:11.000]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:03.000]  as well as detailed information and analysis to help you zero in on the best places to live.
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:08.000]  The ideal location for cabins and vacation homes, as well as safe and unsafe areas.

[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:28.000]  I need to get my feet in shape for summer.
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:31.000]  But every time I get a pedicure, my feet look great.
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.000]  For a while, anyway.
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:36.000]  Then I have to go right back again because they get dry so quickly.
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.000]  Listen, haven't you heard about Cal-X ointment?
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:43.000]  I use it regularly on my heels and they stay looking great.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:46.000]  And my feet feel as good as they look.
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.000]  What's the name again? Wait, I'm getting my pen out.
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:52.000]  It's Cal-X, C-A-L-L-E-X.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.000]  What makes Cal-X ointment so different?
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:58.000]  It's got these natural enzymes that quickly exfoliate dry, cracked feet
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:03.000]  and leave your feet feeling soft and smooth just like a baby's bottom.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:06.000]  For soft, silky feet that look great in sandals,
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.000]  use enzyme-rich, moisturizing Cal-X ointment.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:11.000]  It's diabetic friendly and found in the foot care section of Walgreens,
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:14.000]  Longs, Snyder's Drug, Bilo, Car Drug,
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:18.000]  H-E-B Grocery Stores, Medicine Shop Pharmacies and Rite Aid.
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.000]  Hey, there's a drug store. I'll be right back.
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.000]  I'm getting some Cal-X.
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:34.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:37.000]  You want answers? Well, so does he.
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:41.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:46.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:50.000]  All right, we have the web address of the live webcam.
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:53.000]  And it's working well, I'm told.
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:57.000]  But if we give it out on air or if you spread it all over the web
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:58.000]  thinking it's your little secret,
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:01.000]  you give it to one person, they give it to another, it will go down.
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:04.000]  Do not watch it, okay?
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:07.000]  Or if we've got IT people that know how to grab the signal,
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.000]  that's the only way you should be looking at it,
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:12.000]  to grab it and put it out on your server or boost it.
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:15.000]  But if we go after that source, I guarantee you,
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.000]  everybody uses these free services
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.000]  and you get more than 100 people on those webcams, they go down.
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:25.000]  They had one that could take, what was it, a couple thousand for the RNC.
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:30.000]  You probably got 10 seconds out of every 30 seconds.
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.000]  We need this.
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.000]  Imagine at Waco if they would have had that.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.000]  And now we've got the responsibility.
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:39.000]  When something like this happens, we can't go look at it.
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:40.000]  Now I've got cameras set up.
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:43.000]  They're in there starting to videotape it right now.
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:48.000]  But we can go to Fred Smart, who's there watching the video blog.
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:49.000]  I'm going to shut up, Fred.
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:54.000]  Tell me what you're seeing, what's happening right now on the video cam feed.
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:55.000]  They are smart.
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:58.000]  They're in there with some type of wireless shell phone.
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:01.000]  Now the Feds will learn of this and start jamming it, too.
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.000]  So it's also a Catch-24 that we announced that.
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:04.000]  But whatever, it's war.
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.000]  We're not going to get it all right.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.000]  I caught myself before we gave the address out, though.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:11.000]  Tell us right now, what are you seeing?
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:14.000]  Tim, my Internet's down, Alex, for some reason.
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:15.000]  So Tim,
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:16.000]  So that was Tim I was talking to.
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:17.000]  I heard Tim in the background was watching.
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:18.000]  Yeah, go ahead, Tim.
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:19.000]  Are you looking at it?
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:20.000]  Tim, what are you watching?
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:25.000]  Well, actually, actually, and I've tried to explain it several times,
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:30.000]  what this is is the actual news feed for the Plainfield Wire.
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:35.000]  And I just emailed the link to Aaron for him to look at.
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:39.000]  This is the comprehensive news feed for Plainfield, New Hampshire.
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.000]  It has three stories now up.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:46.000]  The latest one was about four minutes ago about Swat Team's armored vehicle.
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:49.000]  I totally misunderstood in all the chatter.
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:50.000]  I thought there was a live webcam.
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.000]  Well, somebody said live webcam.
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:55.000]  Alex, it's not a live news feed.
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:59.000]  It is a recording of their broadcast.
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:00.000]  I understand. Thank you.
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:01.000]  I understand now.
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:04.000]  I was told earlier by the other person it was a live feed out of there.
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:05.000]  I misunderstood.
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:06.000]  Okay.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:07.000]  I'm sorry, Alex.
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:08.000]  It's all right.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.000]  Hey, this isn't about sorry and anything.
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:13.000]  We're all frothing here because we don't want them to get killed.
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:18.000]  And I guess I was hoping that I heard somebody say live webcam out of there,
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:20.000]  and I hoped, oh, great, they're not dead.
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:22.000]  There's a live webcam.
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:25.000]  I'm just hoping here, and that's what we do when we care about people.
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:29.000]  Don't want fellow patriots to be overrun by a bunch of criminals.
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.000]  But thank you, sir, for that information.
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:32.000]  Who else are we talking to there?
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:34.000]  Who is that, Mr. Smart?
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:36.000]  Tim from Chicago.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:37.000]  Okay.
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:38.000]  So we had Tim on our...
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:39.000]  Good for you, Alex.
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:40.000]  Okay, Tim, you got the floor.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:41.000]  What do you think is going on here?
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.000]  What do you think we should do?
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:49.000]  Well, I co-hosted with Fred and Elaine on their program,
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:53.000]  and they were talking yesterday when we were on air,
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:58.000]  they were talking about these various things that we've already spoken about happening.
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:01.000]  It's obviously...
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:02.000]  Now...
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.000]  Either one, but that's all speculative.
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:07.000]  What we do know is if they are moving in, what they're going to do,
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:10.000]  whether they're going to attack, if they're just going to set up a perimeter
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:15.000]  and basically hold...
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:18.000]  So since they're doing the perimeter,
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:26.000]  it looks like they want to have a big national spectacle.
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:29.000]  Maybe they want patriots to start the war now.
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:32.000]  Maybe this is how Bush wants to trigger his martial law.
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:36.000]  Under the Military Commissions Act...
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.000]  Under the Patriot Act and the Military Commissions Act.
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:39.000]  Right.
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:44.000]  This is exactly what they said for insurrection or resistance.
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:49.000]  It's all in the subsections, and the fact that they didn't do it is just a quickness.
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:56.000]  Well, you know, Alex, at a certain point, at what point is the line crossed?
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:59.000]  You know, as patriots, we've always been drawing lines in the sand,
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:04.000]  and I've said for years we need to have a line in the concrete instead of in the sand
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:07.000]  because the sand keeps getting erased, and we step back another...
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:10.000]  We draw another line, we step back, we draw another line.
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.000]  Where does the line get drawn? You yourself said it.
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:16.000]  Maybe this is the Alamo for our generation.
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:17.000]  We don't know.
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:21.000]  But the fact is that the feds are always pushing, pushing, pushing,
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:24.000]  and we're always retreating, retreating, retreating.
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:29.000]  If it's the time to make the stand, then it is time to make the stand.
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:33.000]  And people are going to have to decide on which side they want to be,
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:36.000]  just like when the Declaration of Independence was signed.
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.000]  Which side are you going to be on?
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:40.000]  Are you going to be for liberty and freedom,
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:44.000]  or are you going to be on the side of the oppressive super state?
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:45.000]  Well, there's no doubt.
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:50.000]  I mean, when I state the question, we're here to analyze and flesh this out
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:53.000]  and look at every angle of it.
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:59.000]  I'm making the statement, are the feds trying to start and incite a fight?
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:01.000]  They know people have said they're going to get violent
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:04.000]  if Ed and Elaine Brown are killed or assaulted.
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:09.000]  So my question is, why would the feds then want to incite this
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:15.000]  and want to activate this now on this bizarre date of the start of the Six-Day War?
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:16.000]  I think that is an interesting point.
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:17.000]  Well, it's real simple.
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:21.000]  I mean, if you strategize the whole thing out, what if it does do this?
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:26.000]  And then people individually start to take out federal officials around the country.
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:27.000]  Okay?
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:30.000]  They're going to declare martial law, and then underneath that,
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.000]  they're going to do house-to-house searches for weaponry.
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:40.000]  Which is exactly what Bush has gotten all set up and declared himself dictator
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:45.000]  back on the 9th of last month, and they funded it and they got it all set up,
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:48.000]  and this is exactly what they want.
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.000]  But the bottom line is, I want the police and military to know,
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:55.000]  you're set up, if this does activate, if this powder keg gets set off,
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:57.000]  you are meant to be wiped out.
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.000]  We've seen the globalist plans, we've gotten all the pieces,
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:04.000]  to later bring in the Mexican and Dutch and Czech Republic troops.
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:08.000]  Those are public plans, mainstream news, to quote the old American terrorists.
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:12.000]  You are just as hated as we are by the New World Order,
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:17.000]  and I just can't believe they can find goons that will go do these types of criminal actions.
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:19.000]  And I mean, from what we're seeing now...
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:25.000]  Oh, Alex, they've been raiding these goons for the last 30 years in the public schools,
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:32.000]  and creating an economy where people have no choice but to go to work for the Army
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:38.000]  and get trained in whatever the Army is training people to do to think, to follow orders,
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:40.000]  not to think for themselves.
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.000]  That's exactly what's been going on.
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:44.000]  So it's no problem in getting the manpower.
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:50.000]  The problem is, or the question is, is this a workable strategy on their behalf?
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:51.000]  And I say no.
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:56.000]  I say that it's just like in Iraq, getting bogged down in an insurgency.
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:00.000]  If they were to create that situation here in this country right now,
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:05.000]  we've got 2 million firearms in the hands of the people.
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:11.000]  Sir, there's 400 million firearms of new manufacture.
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:13.000]  That means the last 85 years.
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:23.000]  There's 160 million gun owners, and if 1% is willing to fight,
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:29.000]  that's 1,600,000 American combatants against the New World Order terror forces.
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:32.000]  Alex, you win on the math. That's fine.
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:34.000]  However many, it's the strategy.
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:37.000]  If they really think that...
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.000]  Sir, I wasn't trying to win on math.
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:41.000]  Listen, we've got to go to break here in just a moment.
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:42.000]  Sir, I want to put you on hold.
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:48.000]  I want to go back and restate all this stuff because this is all very serious.
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:50.000]  This is about Ed and Elaine Brown.
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:53.000]  Let me just re-announce this news for everybody out there.
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:56.000]  Police assembled by Brown's home.
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:59.000]  It has been confirmed by the union leader.
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:01.000]  And it looks like they can handle the bandwidth.
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:03.000]  Go up there, John, and grab all those audio files, please.
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:06.000]  And we're also going to air a Fox News piece that we got about 20 minutes ago
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:08.000]  coming up in the next segment.
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:11.000]  We appreciate both of our guests that are friends with Ed Brown.
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:14.000]  Of course, I've interviewed him and know him well.
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:17.000]  But they're in daily contact with him and co-hosted a show with him.
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:19.000]  They're on with us. We appreciate both of them.
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:22.000]  We have links from PrisonPlanet.com to Ed and Elaine Brown's blog,
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:25.000]  the true horrors and criminality they went through
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:28.000]  at the hands of the collection agency of the Federal Reserve.
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:34.000]  We have the union leader clips we're getting.
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:38.000]  And we're asking people to go there and try to observe what's happening
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:42.000]  and to see specifically what type of military forces.
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:43.000]  That's what this all is.
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:47.000]  It's military-trained police and forces arrayed against the people.
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:51.000]  And you notice the Revolutionary War started in New Hampshire.
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:58.000]  It started in New Hampshire, ladies and gentlemen, and in Massachusetts.
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:05.000]  So this is just classic New World Order launching their attack.
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:07.000]  And they know this has been a big national issue.
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:12.000]  They've waited six-plus months to do this. This is terrible.
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:15.000]  Union leader correspondent was kept away from the Browns compound
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:18.000]  by state police who would not say why.
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:19.000]  That is confirmed.
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:22.000]  Susan Williams, who lives a mile or so away from the Browns.
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:24.000]  Let's try to get her on the horn.
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:26.000]  Call information for Susan Williams.
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:30.000]  John, I know you're doing ten things in Plainfield.
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:32.000]  Let's try to get her on.
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:36.000]  Susan Williams, who lives a mile or so away from the Browns,
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:41.000]  on Center of Town Road, said she saw police officers, SWAT team members,
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:46.000]  and fire truck ambulance helicopter at least one armored vehicle
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:50.000]  assembled in a field across from her driveway at the Browns' home.
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:54.000]  The Browns answered a telephone call from the Associated Press saying,
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:58.000]  This is the Lord's house. This is Sister Elaine and Brother Edward.
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:04.000]  They said nothing was out of the ordinary at the house.
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:08.000]  It sounds like the feds have taken it over.
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:11.000]  That sounds like psychological warfare at the Browns' home.
[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:14.000]  The Browns answered a telephone call from the AP by saying,
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:17.000]  This is the Lord's house. This is Sister Elaine and Brother Edward.
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:19.000]  They don't talk like that.
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:22.000]  I know them both, talked to them both, interviewed them both.
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:24.000]  That's just pure bull.
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.000]  I mean, that is, oh, there's nothing wrong here.
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:30.000]  Again, lying, military tactics.
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:33.000]  This is horrible, ladies and gentlemen. Let's pray for them right now.
[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:36.000]  God, please protect them, and that's your will. Please help them.
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:40.000]  Please, please, please, this is horrible.
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:48.000]  The war on terrorism, will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:51.000]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared,
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:54.000]  but can't afford an underground shelter, so what do you do?
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:57.000]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:59.000]  and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:02.000]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:06.000]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical,

[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:53.000]  Friday, June 1st, gold closed up $10 per ounce and silver closed up 32 cents per ounce.
[00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:58.000]  Significant daily gains in precious metals are not uncommon during volatile times.

[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:14.000]  Precious metals have always preserved purchasing power
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:18.000]  during times of confiscatory taxation and rampant inflation.
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:22.000]  Former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan predicts a recession of alarming magnitude
[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:25.000]  due to increasing budget and trade deficits.
[00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:30.000]  Listen, folks, the current economic system is like a game of financial musical chairs.

[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:46.000]  I'm Dr. Bill Deagle, MD, of the Nutramatical Report here on Genesis.
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:50.000]  Allicin's natural antibiotic from Allomax Nutraceuticals US is a real thing.
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:54.000]  This amazing molecule is a stabilized antimicrobial antipathogenic killer
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:57.000]  from fresh, never-before-available garlic.
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:01.000]  Allicin molecule is biologically active against all bacterial pathogens, viruses,

[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:08.000]  acinetobacter infections that ravage our everyday health.

[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:17.000]  that cause chronic health issues and means a much higher level of wellness for you and your family.

[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:35.000]  Secure online ordering is available at Nutramatical.com or call 888-212-8871.
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:38.000]  That number again, 888-212-8871.
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:42.000]  The most powerful natural antimicrobial available.
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:47.000]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the mark of the beast.
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:50.000]  Soon it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:53.000]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:58.000]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:01.000]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:04.000]  and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:07.000]  In 2005, President Bush signed the Real ID Act,
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:10.000]  which goes into effect May 11, 2008.
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:13.000]  Many people believe that this will be the mark of the beast
[00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:15.000]  because of the restrictive measures included,
[00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:19.000]  which seems to parallel the no buying and selling of Revelations 1317.
[00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:22.000]  In Revelations 14.9, speaking of the mark of the beast,
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:26.000]  it says, if any man worshiped the beast, take notice.
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:28.000]  It says worship the beast.
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:31.000]  This issue is about worship, not economics.
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:33.000]  For a better understanding of this very important topic
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:36.000]  and to receive your three free books and a free DVD,
[00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:39.000]  call 1-888-211-1715.
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:42.000]  That's 1-888-211-1715.
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:50.000]  No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now.
[00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:58.000]  No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now.
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:02.000]  We're the renegades of this atomic age.
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:06.000]  This atomic age of renegades.
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:10.000]  We're the renegades of this atomic age.
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:14.000]  This atomic age of renegades.
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:18.000]  Since the prehistoric ages and the days of ancient Greece,
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:20.000]  right down to the Middle Ages,
[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:22.000]  planet Earth kept going through changes,
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:24.000]  and then the Renaissance came.
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:26.000]  The times continued to change.
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:29.000]  Nothing stayed the same, but there were always renegades,
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:32.000]  like Chief Sillian Bull, Tom Payne,
[00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:34.000]  Dr. Martin Luther King, Malcolm X.
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:36.000]  They were renegades of their time and age.
[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:38.000]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:40.000]  Paul Genesis, reporter.
[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:42.000]  Again, none of this is totally confirmed.
[00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:46.000]  We know local news is reporting WCAX-TV
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:48.000]  that they are evacuating homes.
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:51.000]  State and federal authorities have converged on the home
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:54.000]  of a New Hampshire couple involved in a tax standoff.
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:56.000]  And there is a man named Drew Raines,
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:58.000]  who I know has been reporting in the past.
[00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:00.000]  He's reported to Butch in the past.
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:01.000]  This is unconfirmed.
[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:03.000]  We pray this is not the case,
[00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:05.000]  but we cannot hold this back from you.
[00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:07.000]  Butch, tell them what the report is.
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:08.000]  It's on fire, Alex.
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:09.000]  That's the report I received.
[00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:10.000]  I cannot confirm it.
[00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:11.000]  That's the report I received.
[00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:13.000]  The house is on fire.
[00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:15.000]  I don't know the extent of this.
[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:18.000]  I'm just so angry now that it's hard to concentrate.
[00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:22.000]  As a former black ops officer in the Army in Vietnam
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:24.000]  and in other countries,
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:26.000]  what is it like for you to see your country turn into this?
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:28.000]  Well, being an Air Force sergeant,
[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:30.000]  knowing what I did in Vietnam,
[00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:32.000]  what I saw over there,
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:34.000]  and what I thought I was doing was right,
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:36.000]  this makes me so angry.
[00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:38.000]  I don't get this angry very easily,
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:40.000]  but these people are patriots.
[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:42.000]  They're fine people standing for the truth,
[00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:44.000]  and we're watching them being taken down right now.
[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:46.000]  If the people do not stand up now,
[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:48.000]  America is damned to hell.
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:49.000]  I'm a pastor.
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:50.000]  I'm saying this clearly.
[00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:51.000]  I can say it.
[00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:52.000]  If we do not stand up now,
[00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:53.000]  America is damned,
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:54.000]  and we're rightfully so.
[00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:56.000]  So should every person in this nation be damned
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:58.000]  if we don't stand up right now.
[00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:00.000]  When we were talking on the break,
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:01.000]  you said it's the same.
[00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:02.000]  Damned if you do,
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:03.000]  damned if you don't.
[00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:04.000]  Exactly.
[00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:05.000]  It's time to stand.
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:07.000]  It's time that we're watching innocent people
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:08.000]  be taken down one at a time,
[00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:09.000]  two or three at a time,
[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:10.000]  Waco,
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:11.000]  Ruby Ridge,
[00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:12.000]  on and on and on.
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:13.000]  When will we say no more?
[00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:14.000]  Live or die?
[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:15.000]  Well now,
[00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:16.000]  you said live free or die.
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:17.000]  You said during the break,
[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:19.000]  and this is the live free or die state,
[00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:21.000]  New Hampshire where this is happening,
[00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:23.000]  I think they picked it for a reason,
[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:24.000]  you,
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:26.000]  during the break I was saying,
[00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:28.000]  well don't you think the feds want us,
[00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:29.000]  I mean obviously,
[00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:31.000]  and the feds want to start it now
[00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:32.000]  because we're growing,
[00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:33.000]  we're rising,
[00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:34.000]  so we're not getting any stronger.
[00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:38.000]  But I'm not saying people shouldn't really stand up against this.
[00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:42.000]  My only point is that it's clear they're trying to have a provocation.
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:43.000]  Of course,
[00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:44.000]  and I understand that.
[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:45.000]  I do understand that.
[00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:48.000]  But we can't let innocent people be taken out
[00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:50.000]  while we're trying to build an army.
[00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:52.000]  If we don't pin the first,
[00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:53.000]  we're going to have a hard time pinning the 10th,
[00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:54.000]  the 20th,
[00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:55.000]  the 30th.
[00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:56.000]  It has to be now.
[00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:57.000]  It can't be long.
[00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:58.000]  We can't wait any longer than the future.
[00:59:58.000 --> 00:59:59.000]  It must be starting now.
[00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.000]  If this were you being attacked,
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000]  we'd have to do the same thing for you or for me
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.000]  or anybody else.
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.000]  Well, they're smart.
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.000]  They go after the little guys first.
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.000]  Sure.
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.000]  Absolutely.
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.000]  And then test.
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000]  This is obviously a testing of the waters.
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.000]  Pastor Butch,
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.000]  I mean,
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.000]  we're here.
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:14.000]  We see this going on.
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.000]  We know they have evacuated.
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.000]  They're blocking the press.
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000]  They say they're moving in now.
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000]  That means it was probably an hour ago.
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.000]  That coincides.
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:22.000]  Who is this Drew Rainsfella?
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000]  And what specifically did he tell you?
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:25.000]  Well,
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:26.000]  this was a gentleman called,
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.000]  a call method,
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.000]  you need to call him actually.
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:29.000]  And Drew Rains,
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.000]  I understand,
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.000]  is a reporter,
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000]  kind of a on the scene type guy like you and I.
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000]  I don't know if he's there right now.
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.000]  Okay.
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.000]  Well,
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000]  we need people to call in because so far the rumor we've been told
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:41.000]  turned out to be true.
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000]  I pray this one isn't the case.
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:46.000]  But let me just read this news article for everybody out there.
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:50.000]  Authorities converge on Ed and Elaine Brown's home.
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000]  State and federal authorities have converged on the home
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.000]  of a New Hampshire couple involved in a tax standoff.
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:58.000]  People are being kept several miles away from the center,
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000]  town road in Plainfield,
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000]  where Ed and Elaine Brown live.
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:03.000]  You hear that,
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.000]  ladies and gentlemen?
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000]  They are being kept several miles away.
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.000]  Look,
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.000]  we just need to call all the local reporters.
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.000]  You call John.
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:10.000]  My people are calling.
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.000]  Everybody call and ask,
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.000]  is there smoke?
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:13.000]  Alex,
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:16.000]  this is a tactical raid.
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.000]  The same thing happened in Waco.
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.000]  The press held back.
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:21.000]  The same things happened in hundreds of cases.
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.000]  The press has held back.
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.000]  And that's what they do.
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000]  They don't even want to engage them in a firefight.
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000]  They generally do burn people out
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000]  with incendiary weapons.
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:30.000]  It goes on.
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.000]  It says neighbors,
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.000]  including some who have been evacuated,
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:35.000]  reported police SWAT teams a helicopter.
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:36.000]  They'll use helicopters.
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000]  They tried to burn out Ruby Ridge with a helicopter.
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000]  And at least one armored vehicle converged
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:43.000]  on a field near the home this morning.
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000]  Authorities have not said if they were moving in
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:46.000]  to arrest the fugitives,
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000]  if they burned them out,
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.000]  my God.
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:50.000]  Fugitives?
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.000]  Fugitives from what?
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000]  The Browns have been barricaded.
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.000]  Well,
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.000]  when CPS tries to take your child
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:56.000]  and you don't let them
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:57.000]  and you leave out the back door,
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000]  they announce it's a kidnapping on the news.
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000]  Ninety-nine percent of the time they hear an Amber Alert.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.000]  It's some parents who the CPS tried to take their child
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.000]  so they left.
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000]  And it's fugitives, fugitives.
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000]  The Browns have been barricaded inside their home
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:12.000]  for several months after being convicted of tax evasion.
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000]  They did not even attend their sentencing hearing
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:17.000]  in which they were sentenced to five years in prison.
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.000]  You know what?
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000]  The tree of liberty is watered by the blood of patriots
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.000]  and tyrants.
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.000]  And I'm telling you,
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:23.000]  if they burned them out,
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000]  if they stormtroopered them,
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:29.000]  it's only going to increase the power of the patriot movement.
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:30.000]  We'll be right back.
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.000]  Stay with us.
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:34.000]  We're on the march.
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:39.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.000]  Are you concerned about the high cost of prescription drugs?
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000]  Since January of 2006,

[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000]  That's over 46% savings.
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:58.000]  The average savings for generic drugs was over 71%.
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:02.000]  RxDrugCard.com is the only major discount prescription drug plan

[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:45.000]  Do you know what you can do with solar for under $1,200 now?
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000]  Hi, this is Ken Solar.
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:48.000]  As you may have heard by now,
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:51.000]  I've been designing alternative energy packages for over a decade.
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000]  The solar powered generators that I produce
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:57.000]  will get you all the solar power you need for your household essentials.
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:00.000]  Your refrigerator, your freezer, lights, fans, electric blankets,
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:04.000]  TV, radio clocks, phones, computers and a lot more.
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:07.000]  No gas, no fumes and they're totally silent.
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:10.000]  Each solar powered generator comes complete with everything you'll need
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:14.000]  including the solar panel, a 3,000 watt peak inverter,
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:17.000]  a step-by-step quick setup sheet and battery backup.
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:18.000]  I reached that point in my life
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:21.000]  where I just didn't want to have to rely on everyone else anymore,
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:24.000]  you know, power companies, government.
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000]  Anyway, getting yourself free from the utility grid
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000]  is a lot easier than you might think.
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.000]  Are you ready to go solar?

[01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:04.000]  Your own personal Jesus
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:07.000]  By the way, we're going to be protesting against the New World War,
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:10.000]  the North American Union and for Ed Brown
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000]  today at 7 o'clock in front of Rick Perry's.
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:15.000]  In fact, now it's going to be about that.
[01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:16.000]  You say, why in Texas?
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:19.000]  Because he's one of the head New World Order minions in the U.S. now.
[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:20.000]  He's been to Bilderberg.
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000]  It's all part of this great evil.
[01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:23.000]  This is where Waco happened.
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000]  No more Wacos.
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000]  We're going to have a demonstration tonight at 7 o'clock.
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.000]  We were going for Bilderberg.
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000]  It'll be about that too.
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000]  I'm going to be out there at 7 o'clock tonight.
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000]  Now, Jack McClam just called us 20 minutes ago.
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:38.000]  He was on the phone with the sheriff in the county there.
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:40.000]  I'm told he just contacted us.
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:41.000]  We're getting him lined up right now.
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:44.000]  Do you have Jack McClam yet?
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000]  I'm sure 50 million people are calling his number right now.
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:49.000]  Do we have Jack?
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:50.000]  God, I need a bigger staff.
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000]  My people worked so hard and did such a good job.
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:53.000]  John's not coming to me.
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:54.000]  He must be on the phone.
[01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000]  Let's go back to Pastor Butch Paul.
[01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000]  Butch, I hope you're wrong.
[01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:01.000]  I'm not saying I hope you're wrong.
[01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:04.000]  I hope this report you got is wrong.
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:07.000]  But again, we have to report it as it comes in.
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:11.000]  It was his unconfirmed report that the house is on fire.
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:15.000]  But every other unconfirmed report up to this one has been confirmed.
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:19.000]  In my gut, it fits the MO, the person leaving in the morning,
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:22.000]  the drone the night before, and now a fire.
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:25.000]  That's what these cowards do is they burn people out,
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000]  and they like to shoot them as they run out burning.
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:28.000]  It's part of the fun.
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:33.000]  And if they burn them out, we need to get a week or so
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:36.000]  to have the local grand jury indict these criminals.
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:40.000]  But of course, they back everybody off so they can carry out the murders silently.
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000]  I'm going to say this in any battle.
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000]  John, are you there?
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:45.000]  Okay, good.
[01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000]  I didn't even know because I was calling for Butch and he didn't come back.
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000]  Do we have Jack McClam?
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:50.000]  Okay, good.
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:51.000]  We're getting him on.
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.000]  I'm going to have Butch on with us, too.
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:53.000]  I'm going to say this right now.
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000]  I'm not afraid to die.
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:58.000]  And believe me, at my animal level, I like to fight.
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:01.000]  I tear into people all the time.
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:04.000]  I was a maniac growing up, folks.
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:07.000]  And frankly, I like fighting two or three people.
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:10.000]  I mean, I like having odds down.
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000]  It's just I'm an animalistic person.
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000]  And I'm not saying I'm a tough guy, either.
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:17.000]  No, I've just got a couple screws loose and everybody knows it.
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:22.000]  But the point here is that I'm a pretty macho person, okay?
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000]  I'll tell you right now.
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:28.000]  I mean, people see me run up to 500 lorica in case they threaten me and tell them, you know, bring it on.
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:37.000]  But I've learned to control myself because I've had this attitude of let's just go ahead and get it on, okay?
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000]  There's nothing I'd like better, believe me.
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:43.000]  And I'm going to say this, and I can be the big coward here out in the public and everything.
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:51.000]  If they've killed Edna Lane Brown, or if they've burned them out, or if they've surrounded, and we know they've surrounded them and they've said they're moving in,
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:57.000]  and we sit there and let the word of this spread, because that's what happened at Lexington and Concord.
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:03.000]  It took weeks for this thing to really get cranky, and in the scheme of time.
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:11.000]  Even if we let the news of this get out, and how they burned them out, or what they truly did, once we find out, that will build our forces even greater.
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:20.000]  They are doing this to preemptively try to make us watch military operations against the New World Order take over the U.S.
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000]  because they're losing on the immigration bill.
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:26.000]  They're losing on the North American Union and the Pan American Union through CAFTA.
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:29.000]  They are losing on their Second Amendment grabs.
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:32.000]  They are losing on every front we are taking over.
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:41.000]  Las Vegas odds have gone from 15 to 1, you know, 100 to 1, 15 to 1, to now saying he is the leader, he's the only Republican that can beat the Democrats.
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:46.000]  They're now saying that by primary time, this is major, these are the people that aren't ever wrong, folks.
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000]  I mean, rarely.
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:56.000]  They are panicking right now, and they want to pick a fight now, and chew up all their idiot cops and dumbed down military.
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:01.000]  I'm not knocking you, you're brain dead, you've been brainwashed, you've been under major mind control.
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000]  We have tried to be your friends.
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:06.000]  Jesus, God help, I can't believe we're in the middle.
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000]  Folks, I know the country.
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:12.000]  This isn't people 10 years ago in the patriot movement shooting their mouths off about shooting.
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:17.000]  Do you realize, police and military, there are millions of former special forces and other people
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000]  who want to start killing you.
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:23.000]  Do you fools understand that if it starts, you're going to be dead everywhere.
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:27.000]  Within days, you're going to be in armored compounds, in citadel fashion.
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:31.000]  We will literally kick the living hell out of you.
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:34.000]  I don't want this to start, okay?
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:37.000]  This is about to start, do you understand that?
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:40.000]  Do you understand people want to come after you?
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:43.000]  Do you understand you idiots are being used?
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000]  We're just asking people.
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:48.000]  Do we need to wait a few days before this stuff kicks off?
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:51.000]  I'm calling for calm, call me a coward if you want.
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:54.000]  Let's bring up Butch Paul, then Jack McClam, who was just...
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:57.000]  Butch, I'm not trying to be cowardly here.
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:01.000]  In fact, I'm afraid right now to even come out here and tell you what I really think
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000]  because I'm afraid of people thinking I'm a coward.
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:04.000]  That's my only fear.
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:07.000]  I'm saying, do we want to give them their war now?
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:08.000]  Butch, is that what you're saying?
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:13.000]  Well, I'm saying, Alex, if this were you or your brother or sister or your mom or dad
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:16.000]  or your children, what would you do?
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:22.000]  You know, quite frankly, this is all happening live.
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:26.000]  Obviously, I'd want people to rise up for me, but frankly, if I could coldly sit back
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:31.000]  and know that I was a sacrifice, it would literally increase our power a year from now
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:32.000]  to defeat them.
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:33.000]  I just want to beat them.
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:34.000]  So I'm looking at strategies.
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:35.000]  I understand.
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000]  But I know sometimes you can't do strategies.
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:38.000]  Forget the maneuvers.
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:39.000]  Go straight at them.
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:42.000]  Well, you know, again, if you or I, we wouldn't mind being a sacrifice.
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.000]  I understand that.
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:46.000]  But if this were your brother or sister, mom or dad or son or daughter...
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:47.000]  I couldn't control myself.
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:48.000]  No, you could not.
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:52.000]  This is somebody's brother or sister, somebody's mom or dad, somebody's whatever.
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000]  And somebody cares enough.
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000]  And this has got...
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:59.000]  I won't say, Alex, I mean, this is another crossroads.
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:00.000]  Are we going to...
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:01.000]  It's a test.
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:02.000]  It's a test.
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:05.000]  Are we going to fail another one?
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:06.000]  Absolutely.
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:09.000]  Well, you know, we failed Waco, but then that energized the whole movement today.
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:10.000]  It did for a while.
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:14.000]  And then they carried out Oklahoma City to try to blame it on us.
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:15.000]  But it doesn't work anymore.
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000]  Everybody knows they're behind the terror.
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:20.000]  It's on the front page of the Jerusalem Post that Israel's staging terror.
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:23.000]  You know, look at this from a pastor's viewpoint, and that's who I am.
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:24.000]  I'm a Christian.
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:25.000]  I am a Christian.
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000]  I'm a non-violent person.
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:28.000]  Anyone knows me.
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:29.000]  I have five grandbabies.
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:30.000]  I'm a wuss.
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:31.000]  And they know it.
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:32.000]  I mean, I'm a non-violent person.
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:35.000]  But when someone attacks an innocent person...
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:36.000]  Here you are.
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:37.000]  You were running black ops in Cambodia.
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:38.000]  Just stay there.
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:39.000]  Let me go to Jack McClam.
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:40.000]  Let's go to Jack McClam right now.
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:44.000]  Jack, who was there at Ruby Ridge, who got the family out, who they caught it on video
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:48.000]  when they tried to burn the building up with a helicopter with a bladder full of gasoline.
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000]  Jack, I pray to God it isn't true.
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:54.000]  Have you gotten any intel on whether that house is on fire or is that bull?
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000]  No, I haven't gotten any intel.
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:01.000]  I talked to the sheriff's office just about a half hour ago when I heard that this was
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:02.000]  going on.
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:06.000]  And the sheriff is conveniently out of town.
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:10.000]  Like, that's the same thing they did up at Ruby Ridge.
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:11.000]  Same thing at Ruby Ridge.
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:17.000]  And the sheriff in Waco handed over jurisdiction to the feds.
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:18.000]  And leapt.
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:22.000]  The only buddy within the office is a gal named Barbara, who's the secretary of the
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:23.000]  sheriff.
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000]  And so we didn't do very well.
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:29.000]  And she told me she was going to take her phone off the hook because she can't get her
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000]  work done, so she's not concerned at all.
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:35.000]  Yeah, she's going to get her work done, eat her sandwich while people die.
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:36.000]  Yeah.
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:41.000]  So I told her, I told her, I said that we had sent our sheriff's video to the sheriff
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:48.000]  six months ago or more showing that he is in total control when the feds come into town.
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:49.000]  We've got the sheriff's video.
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000]  It's an absolute fact.
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:54.000]  You know, and showing him what his power and jurisdiction is.
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:14:00.000]  And I told her, I said, I just need to get the message to those on the scene that if
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:03.000]  they turn it over to the feds, people are going to die.
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000]  And I said, it doesn't have to be that way.
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:12.000]  If the sheriff will stay in control, or his men, that they will have, they can have a
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000]  peaceful conclusion of this thing.
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000]  I'm looking at Ed Elaine Brown.
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:17.000]  They're great people.
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000]  They're great people in the live free or die state.
[01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000]  They are literally living that maxim.
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000]  I got to bring up the key point here.
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:26.000]  Jack, you know this, you shot Ruby Ridge with Waco.
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:29.000]  You know those are the zeniths of the whole resistance.
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:32.000]  If those wouldn't have happened and the feds wouldn't have done that, we wouldn't have
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:37.000]  the movement today that's defeating the Amnesty, defeating the North American Union.
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:41.000]  We're having victories, strategy-wise, not in a hot-blooded way.
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:42.000]  And I understand that.
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000]  But I don't think we can control people.
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000]  And the feds may have staged something and say the Patriots did it.
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000]  I mean, that's what they do.
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:50.000]  What they'll do.
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:54.000]  Alex and Jack, this boils down to something that we need to think about.
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:59.000]  The IRS and the federal government obviously doesn't need their pittance, their tax.
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:00.000]  That is not the point.
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000]  They're losing control when they know that.
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:05.000]  If one person gets by with this, then others will do the same thing.
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000]  So they must make an example of Ed Elaine.
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:08.000]  That's what's going on right now.
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:11.000]  They're trying to scare the people back in the box, back in the cage.
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000]  They don't need the money.
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000]  Money's not the issue.
[01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:16.000]  It's a power trip.
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000]  And they cannot allow us to take a stand.
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000]  They'll take us out one at a time.
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:24.000]  And God forbid this blows into a full-scale revolution.
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:27.000]  But if it does, then so be it.
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000]  I don't see any choice.
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:30.000]  Well, let me get Jack McClam's take on that.
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:36.000]  And then if we've still got Fred Smart and Tim or is it Jim who know Ed and have been doing a show with him.
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:39.000]  If they're still there, I want to go back to them in a moment and keep both you gentlemen on.
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000]  We're suspending all other programming now.
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000]  I'm even trying to get Ted to suspend some of the ads here.
[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:44.000]  I'll pay for them.
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:45.000]  I don't care.
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:50.000]  Gentlemen, so much is – Jack, I mean, I know you're having the same thoughts.
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:54.000]  You're a veteran, most highly decorated police officer in Phoenix, Arizona's history.
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:58.000]  You've been 27 years, police and military against the New World Order.
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:15:59.000]  We knew this was coming.
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000]  We're having so many strides peacefully right now.
[01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000]  We're starting to turn the corner.
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000]  I know they've got to be stood up for.
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:06.000]  We don't know if they're dead.
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000]  We don't know if they've really been burnt out.
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:12.000]  It says that they've evacuated the area and, quote, the federal and state forces.
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:15.000]  Paramilitary forces have, quote, moved against them.
[01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:16.000]  That is confirmed.
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:17.000]  They've been moved against.
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000]  At least they got in on the property.
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000]  They're encircling them, the bare minimum.
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000]  Jack, I mean, what do you see happening?
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:27.000]  We can't control all the people out there that are going to go off and start –
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:33.000]  Well, brother, what I think it is, and I have agreement with some of my friends in the military
[01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:40.000]  and law enforcement, is they're looking for an event to push us into a violent confrontation
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:45.000]  so they can suspend the First Amendment, and we cannot reach any more people.
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:52.000]  This may very well be the event they're pushing to try to get everybody to go there with their guns.
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:56.000]  And they've been having Fox News TV productions and dramas on NBC.
[01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:01.000]  Every TV show I've seen with dramas, with the cop shows now, is where talk show hosts –
[01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000]  and a lot of times they'll even have names like Alex.
[01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:04.000]  Then they'll be from Texas.
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:08.000]  I mean, people joke that it's always an archetype of me.
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:09.000]  And then there's a standoff.
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:10.000]  We report it.
[01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:11.000]  It causes a riot.
[01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:14.000]  The cops mow everybody down and then ban free speech.
[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000]  So you are getting that from Intel's –
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000]  That's what they want to do because we're winning, brother.
[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:19.000]  We're winning.
[01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:23.000]  And, my dear brother, they're with you.
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000]  Pastor, you know we're winning.
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:34.000]  And if they can push us now, right now, into starting the war, we lose and they win.
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:42.000]  If they can't push us into starting a violent revolution at this moment, they lose.
[01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000]  Because we continue to go awaken people.
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:50.000]  If they kill that family, then they lose big time if we still have the First Amendment.
[01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:56.000]  But if we go to war with them right now, then they win because we can't reach any more people.
[01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000]  And that is exactly what they want to do.
[01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:02.000]  Well, whatever happens, let me just say this and then Bush can jump in.
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:07.000]  Whatever happens, it's the globalists' fault and they caused this and they're a bunch of murder and scum.
[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:08.000]  Go ahead.
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:13.000]  Okay, now my question is this and I'm not trying to be a provocator here by any means.
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:17.000]  If we don't do it, if we don't take a stand and we'll say go to war,
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:20.000]  the feds will do it for us and blame it on us and that's going to happen.
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:21.000]  It's happened before.
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000]  It happened in Oklahoma City.
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:24.000]  Obviously that happened.
[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000]  But here's a question, Jack and Alex.
[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:27.000]  I mean this sincerely.
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:28.000]  This is a sincere question.
[01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:31.000]  Not a way to cause an argument.
[01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:36.000]  But how many innocent land would you allow to be slaughtered as a way to further our cause?
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:39.000]  I mean can we justify that before a holy god?
[01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:46.000]  Well, listen, I'm being completely honest here.
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:53.000]  No other talk show host would get on the air and have an open discussion about how this will empower the movement for liberty and freedom.
[01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:56.000]  Listen, I'm not saying people shouldn't resist.
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000]  We're having an open discussion.
[01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:01.000]  This is the number one biggest show in the country, biggest websites.
[01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:04.000]  Everybody's listening right now, millions, and they're wanting to know.
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000]  We have a great responsibility.
[01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:10.000]  I'm just not going off half-cocked yet because we don't know what's really happened there.
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:16.000]  But I'm telling you, if these bastards kill them, the blood is on their hands and they've drawn first blood 10,000 times.
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000]  Jack McClam, go ahead.
[01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000]  Well, we win if they kill that family.
[01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:26.000]  Now I'm telling you right now, I'm here at my home and if I were in that position,
[01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:32.000]  I know that if they came in and killed me that we would win in the freedom movement.
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:41.000]  We would win because they wouldn't have pushed us into going to this violent confrontation that they want to put us under martial law
[01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:47.000]  and end our growth of awakening people that is tremendous right now.
[01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:48.000]  It is tremendous.
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000]  They're scared to death of it.
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:55.000]  They want to shut us down and this could very well be the way they're trying to do it
[01:19:55.000 --> 01:20:00.000]  is to get us to respond with our weapons all across the country into that area
[01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:06.000]  and we'll be under martial law and there won't be any more people brought to the knowledge that the bad guys are actually...
[01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:07.000]  And let's be clear.
[01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:12.000]  Then phase two starts that the police and military haven't been told even as high as one-star generals.
[01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:15.000]  You are all to be chewed up in the fight with us.
[01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000]  You're going to be completely defeated.
[01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:18.000]  I want them to know this.
[01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000]  There's no doubt we will destroy you.
[01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000]  We will smash you.
[01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:25.000]  We can totally, totally defeat you.
[01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000]  Just obliterate you.
[01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:28.000]  Now, here's the point.
[01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:31.000]  Then they're going to bring in the foreign troops and then it's on.
[01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:32.000]  Starvation.
[01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:37.000]  It's going to look like New Orleans nationwide and don't you think for a minute the globalists aren't planning it.
[01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:41.000]  Everything they've done is for the moment we have now reached.
[01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:42.000]  We are in the...
[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000]  I ask God to give us guidance.
[01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000]  This is unbelievable.
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:49.000]  I ask this question again and I totally agree with Jack.
[01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:50.000]  I'm willing to be a sacrificial lamb.
[01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000]  I would be honored to die for the cause.
[01:20:52.000 --> 01:21:01.000]  If they would kill me, if they would kill me and it would help reach and awaken people, I would say go ahead and kill me.
[01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000]  Right, but here's my question.
[01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:06.000]  I'm asking this question as trying to be a pastor here in a sense.
[01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:10.000]  Do we have the right, though, to volunteer them to be a sacrificial lamb?
[01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:11.000]  Do we have the right to say...
[01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:12.000]  Well, they have volunteered.
[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:13.000]  They said they're ready to die.
[01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:17.000]  I hear, but do we have a right, though, to say, hey, go ahead and take them out.
[01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:20.000]  That's just one more lamb for the slaughter to further the cause.
[01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:21.000]  That's a serious question.
[01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:22.000]  I mean...
[01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:31.000]  Well, I think, brother, I think, brother, you know I pray every night that God stops George Bush and company from doing another false flag operation
[01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:39.000]  because if he does that, they will convince the American people that it was Iran and we've got to go into Iran.
[01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:49.000]  And so the same way here I pray and I've already prayed this morning that the people will not go there in mass because that is what this is all about.
[01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:50.000]  I feel it in my heart.
[01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:51.000]  They're trying...
[01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:59.000]  They know that everybody's been praying for and thinking and knowing about Ed Brown, this family,
[01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:07.000]  and this is the way they hope to push us into the violent revolution and end our growth of awakening God's people.
[01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000]  Well, do you think we can...
[01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:10.000]  Do you think that...
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:13.000]  And again, I'm asking the question in the middle of my heart for a long time.
[01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:14.000]  I'm 58 years old.
[01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:17.000]  I've been preaching 30 years, so I've been part of this a long time.
[01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:21.000]  Do you think that we're going to win a tyranny by voting or by talking?
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:25.000]  The tyrants will not back down, but there won't be a petition in the office.
[01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:32.000]  The point is that no one can doubt that our force is growing and growing and growing, and it's important we're having this discussion.
[01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000]  We need to get more information.
[01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:35.000]  We're going to skip this break.
[01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:40.000]  Do we still have the other gentlemen on, Mr. Smart and others?
[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:46.000]  Gentlemen, I want to let you go, but I'd like you to pop back in here on Genesis as the day unfolds.
[01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:49.000]  I know you've got your own program you've got to do here in a few minutes.
[01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:50.000]  I've got three things to say.
[01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000]  Okay, who is this?
[01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:53.000]  Oh, hi.
[01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:54.000]  This is Tim.
[01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000]  Okay, go ahead, Tim.
[01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000]  I've got three things to say, basically, Alex.
[01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:05.000]  One is nemo me impugnus et, which is Latin for no man injures me with impunity.
[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:11.000]  When the law no longer works, we go back to the higher law, the older law, and that is the law of revenge.
[01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:12.000]  Law of the jungle.
[01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:15.000]  Second, Michael Collins gambit.
[01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:19.000]  What we're facing here is something we've got to be smart about.
[01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:24.000]  If, as Jack McClam said, if they have killed this family and these people,
[01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:31.000]  we cannot do a frontal assault like Amon De Valera wanted to do back in the early 1920s.
[01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:34.000]  Michael Collins is the one who says, no, you go for the head.
[01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:44.000]  That's when he put the unit together and simply said, you take out the British leaders and you take out the Irish collaborators.
[01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:47.000]  The third thing is leaderless resistance.
[01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:48.000]  Everybody can look it up.
[01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000]  This is something that can't be coordinated.
[01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000]  It has to come out of your heart.
[01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:55.000]  The point is you cannot have a frontal assault.
[01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:56.000]  It's called total resistance.
[01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:57.000]  Yes.
[01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000]  We cannot have a frontal assault.
[01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000]  It would be suicide.
[01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:04.000]  No, actually, a frontal assault would win as well, sir.
[01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000]  It's a tidal wave.
[01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:07.000]  They're a bunch of cowards.
[01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:08.000]  I've seen these guys.
[01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:11.000]  I mean, look at them in Virginia, hiding behind trees.
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000]  Listen, I appreciate you.
[01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000]  Let's now go to Mr. Smart.
[01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:18.000]  Mr. Smart, comments?
[01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000]  Yeah, Alex.
[01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:28.000]  Alex, I'm a big fan of just the power of prayer and action in a positive light.
[01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:34.000]  If you get people activated and motivated to get out and walk and run and pray,
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:41.000]  I don't care if you're praying the rosary, but you're getting outside a peaceful grouping of tens of thousands,
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:48.000]  about millions of people in and around Plainfield, in and around Lebanon is needed right now.
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000]  I agree, and I appreciate you.
[01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:51.000]  Check in with us later.
[01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:54.000]  God bless you, my friend, and I appreciate you with your reports.
[01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:58.000]  If the folks up here in New Hampshire that can get over there with video cameras right now...
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:24:59.000]  That's the key.
[01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:00.000]  Get out there right now.
[01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:01.000]  Video all this.
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:02.000]  Get it on video.
[01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000]  Get that information out.
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:09.000]  Don't be cowards, but drive up to the checkpoint and at least get video of that.
[01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:10.000]  Absolutely.
[01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:15.000]  And this, you know, sacrificial lamb, okay, we'll say this could be another sacrificial lamb to further the cause,
[01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:16.000]  and I'm not going to debate that.
[01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000]  That could be what it could be.
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:23.000]  But, again, I don't know that I have a right to choose who gets to be the sacrificial lamb and who doesn't.
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000]  That isn't in my...
[01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:26.000]  Well, let's just wait and see.
[01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000]  Let me get a comment from Jack McClam real quick.
[01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:35.000]  Well, I'm a warrior for the Vietnam War, and I worked the war zone in South Phoenix for years,
[01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:40.000]  lost seven of my fellow officers down there in South Phoenix.
[01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000]  I would like to go kick butt.
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:46.000]  I mean, I would like to go clean house, but I know their plan,
[01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:53.000]  and I don't want to be a part of initiating their shutdown of this wonderful awakening going on in America today,
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000]  and I think that's what this is all about.
[01:25:55.000 --> 01:26:02.000]  So we have to be wise, and we have to think about what their plans are and why they're doing this.
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:09.000]  And if our dear brother goes to heaven to be with the Lord and his family, we'll see him again one day.
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:18.000]  But I know how I feel that if I could help the freedom movement awaken more people with my death, I would do it tomorrow.
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000]  I would have them come in and do me tomorrow.
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000]  So we have to be wise.
[01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:23.000]  I don't like it.
[01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:26.000]  I would love to go in and just kick butt and take our country back,
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:30.000]  but we will have more people next week with us.
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:35.000]  If they kill this family in the weeks after, then they won't even imagine.
[01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:40.000]  They're hoping they can get us to do something violent as a group of people around the nation.
[01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:43.000]  So I say that we must pray.
[01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:49.000]  We should go there and pray and hold fast, and we should all fast and pray to the Lord that the family be protected,
[01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:52.000]  but let God's will be done.
[01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000]  We have to awaken more people.
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:27:00.000]  Our main goal is to keep on the First Amendment, allowing us to awaken more and more people,
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:03.000]  because it's scaring the tar out of the enemy of God.
[01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:04.000]  I'll say this.
[01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:05.000]  I don't just say this for effect.
[01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:06.000]  It's true.
[01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:07.000]  They are imploding.
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:08.000]  Everyone's waking up.
[01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:09.000]  They're losing all credibility.
[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000]  They are in info war retreat.
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:15.000]  We are surging, and I guarantee you they're probably going to nuke Chicago in the next month.
[01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000]  There's no telling what the glove.
[01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000]  I can just tell you right now, everybody feels it.
[01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:23.000]  Everybody knows that it's all coming to a head right now, and it's just everything.
[01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:24.000]  I'm talking about the next year.
[01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:29.000]  It's all accelerating, and whatever happens, happens, but I guarantee you those dumb cops
[01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:33.000]  and those dumb military people have no idea that they're being used right now.
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:34.000]  You know, what she is saying is very true.
[01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:35.000]  We have no idea.
[01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:36.000]  What she says is very true.
[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:39.000]  They're going to do something to escape martial law, no matter what it is.
[01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:42.000]  Whether we do it or they do it, they're going to do it.
[01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:48.000]  I don't know how, and I'm not saying for anybody to go out there and do anything violent.
[01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:49.000]  Honestly, I'm not, Jack.
[01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000]  I'm saying, but what do we do?
[01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:52.000]  When do we draw the line?
[01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:53.000]  When do we say no more?
[01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:54.000]  It's enough.
[01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:55.000]  Where?
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:59.000]  We murdered 50 million innocent children in the womb, and no one has stopped that yet.
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:03.000]  We let sodomites and lesbians take over the country and run the offices and control us.
[01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000]  When do we say no more as a people?
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:10.000]  How long will it take before we say we die by the means, or we die one at a time?
[01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:11.000]  What difference does it make?
[01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000]  We die, we die.
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:20.000]  I've never seen so many police officers and soldiers waking up in my 27 years of doing this work,
[01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000]  and I want to see that continue.
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:25.000]  More and more police and soldiers wake up.
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:31.000]  I just talked to a guy this morning over there on the East Coast that has his sheriff awake now
[01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:38.000]  and communicating with us, and brother, if a couple more of our people have to die right now
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:41.000]  so we can continue this great awakening, so be it.
[01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:44.000]  That's the way it's got to be, and that's not the war you're in me speaking.
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:48.000]  I want to go kick butt and take these people out.
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000]  But you've got to realize we will kick the butts.
[01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:51.000]  I want to make this point.
[01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:57.000]  We will kick the butt of worthless scum minions in black uniforms that the New World Order wants to die.
[01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:58.000]  Remember that.
[01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:02.000]  What the fellow said earlier, if they start the martial law, the mass roundups,
[01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:07.000]  it is the resistance model used against the Germans in Europe.
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000]  It is the resistance model used over and over again.
[01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:13.000]  That is the model, and everybody needs to understand that.
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:19.000]  If you don't know what lone wolf resistance is, you better learn real fast, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:22.000]  Well, I do know there's something going to give in the very near future.
[01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:23.000]  My spirit, I sense this.
[01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:24.000]  I know you do, Jack.
[01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:25.000]  I know you do, Alex.
[01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000]  Something is going to break soon.
[01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:28.000]  I don't know when.
[01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:31.000]  I'm not a prophet, but I'm also not unlearned.
[01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:32.000]  But I do feel it in the spirit.
[01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:33.000]  Everybody feels it.
[01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:34.000]  I can't even sleep now.
[01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:35.000]  No, it's imminent.
[01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:36.000]  It's going to be imminent.
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:37.000]  It's just like what's going to be shelled.
[01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000]  I was in Cameroon Bay in Phuket, another place.
[01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:45.000]  When I knew this shelling was imminent, it's a gut feeling that you know is coming.
[01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:46.000]  Get ready.
[01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:49.000]  Now, this may be the key, and this is what I fear.
[01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:50.000]  I mean this sincerely.
[01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:53.000]  If we don't intercede now, I'm not telling us to do it.
[01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:54.000]  I'm just making a comment here.
[01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:58.000]  If we don't do it, will the feds do it and label us anyway?
[01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000]  They're going to have their way.
[01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:01.000]  That's a key point.
[01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:04.000]  I mean, in my life, I have had a feeling right before a car came out of nowhere
[01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:05.000]  and hit me in the car.
[01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000]  I've had feelings right before somebody tried to mug me.
[01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000]  And you're saying, and I've talked to a lot of people,
[01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000]  that right before you get shelled at random times,
[01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000]  you'd know when they were coming before it even started.
[01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:14.000]  Yes.
[01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:15.000]  And I want to just say how bad it's getting.
[01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:18.000]  I put out a monthly news magazine called the Minuteman News.
[01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:21.000]  And I've had two people now, one from Ohio, one from Pennsylvania, call me,
[01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:26.000]  that were pulled over by cops, saw the magazine, on the front seat of the car.
[01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:27.000]  This is the guy's truth.
[01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000]  I'm telling you right now, I just had one call today.
[01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:30.000]  I understand.
[01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:33.000]  They called one, the gentleman in Ohio, they called an FBI.
[01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:36.000]  They called the FBI, the terrorist task force, to come and arrest him.
[01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:37.000]  That's the truth.
[01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:40.000]  And they took me for five hours and interrogated him.
[01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:43.000]  They called a copy of my magazine on the front seat along the Constitution
[01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:44.000]  and a road map.
[01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000]  And they called Pennsylvania this morning.
[01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:50.000]  The cops said, that magazine is a virgin material.
[01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000]  This time next year, he said, this time next year,
[01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000]  you'll be arrested for having the magazine in your possession.
[01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:55.000]  That's what he told me.
[01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000]  Yeah, they're already telling the cops Marshall Law is coming.
[01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:02.000]  And it was in AP last week that Christians had even said gay rights groups
[01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:05.000]  environmental groups, everybody gets arrested.
[01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:06.000]  Good God.
[01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:07.000]  Stay there, Jack McLean.
[01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:08.000]  Stay there, Butch Paul.
[01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:09.000]  I want to hear more about this.
[01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000]  You called the police and they told you,
[01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:14.000]  next year this time we're coming to arrest you.
[01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:15.000]  My God.
[01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000]  Everybody, you know it's coming.
[01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000]  This is so horrible.
[01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:26.000]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com
[01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:29.000]  or call 877-300-7645.
[01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:37.000]  Through the years of providing water filters to America,
[01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000]  you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000]  You asked us to make the water level visible
[01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000]  to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:44.000]  We listened.
[01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:47.000]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used
[01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000]  in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:50.000]  We listened.
[01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:54.000]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:55.000]  We listened.
[01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:58.000]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping
[01:31:58.000 --> 01:31:59.000]  and during power outages.
[01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:00.000]  We listened.
[01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:03.000]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter
[01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:06.000]  that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:07.000]  Again, we listened.
[01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000]  Introducing the Berkey Light,
[01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:12.000]  the gravity filter requested by America,
[01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:15.000]  designed by Americans, and made in America.
[01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:18.000]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water purifier.
[01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000]  Only $279.
[01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:23.000]  Call New Millennium, 888-803-4438.
[01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:26.000]  That's 888-803-4438
[01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:29.000]  or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:04.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:07.000]  Now, we don't know if this is more government disinfo.
[01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000]  It's from Fox 25.
[01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:13.000]  We also have a source in WNET out of Scranton
[01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:19.000]  about National Guard being mobilized in those areas.
[01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000]  This is Fox 25.
[01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000]  U.S. Marshals served search warrant
[01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000]  to seize Brown's dental office.
[01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:28.000]  U.S. Marshals Service says a supporter of the fugitives
[01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:31.000]  was detained near the Brown's home this morning
[01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000]  and that they served a federal warrant
[01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000]  to seize Elaine Brown's dental office.
[01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:38.000]  Now, if they were on the property or near it
[01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:41.000]  and grabbed this guy while he was walking the dog,
[01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000]  that could be a cover for him,
[01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:46.000]  or it probably means he's a good guy, a hero.
[01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:49.000]  But that means that they've done an abortive coup.
[01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000]  And I said this in the first hour.
[01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000]  I said, just because they've surrounded,
[01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000]  just because they're evacuating nearby houses,
[01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000]  doesn't mean they'll move in.
[01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:01.000]  They'll come in like a pit bull grabbing a little puppy.
[01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000]  It'll grab it and bite it and then let go
[01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000]  and then grab it again.
[01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000]  We saw this with Indianapolis Baptist Temple.
[01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000]  I've seen this M.O. before they invaded Panama.
[01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000]  They did drills for months where they'd act like
[01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000]  they were going to invade until the Panamanians
[01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000]  finally stood down when the real attack came.
[01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000]  Now, they do this.
[01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:20.000]  They cry wolf, so we'll put out the report
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000]  and be seen as crying wolf.
[01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000]  They'll send a wolf out, we'll report it,
[01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000]  and then people say, well, where's the wolf?
[01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000]  By the time the media is done, they'll say
[01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000]  there was never police, nobody was ever out there.
[01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000]  But I got AP, I got local news, they are there.
[01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:35.000]  And this could be another shield,
[01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000]  because if they've already engaged
[01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000]  and grabbed people off near the property
[01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000]  or on the property, and they've already shut down roads
[01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000]  and evacuating houses,
[01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000]  they're probably still moving in.
[01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000]  That's what my gut tells me, but it may be wrong
[01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000]  because they may not know what they're going to do.
[01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:53.000]  Jack McClam, with your military and police experience
[01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000]  and with you, also, Pastor Butch Paul,
[01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000]  with your experience, what do you think
[01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000]  with this new intel?
[01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000]  What's your gut level on that?
[01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000]  You ask me or Jack, Alec?
[01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000]  Both of you.
[01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000]  Jack?
[01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000]  I don't hear Jack.
[01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:13.000]  But I don't know exactly what's happening.
[01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000]  Obviously, I'm not there, but I think
[01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000]  this is another practice maneuver
[01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:20.000]  with the feds, with the military.
[01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000]  This is getting people used to the idea.
[01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000]  It's a laboratory.
[01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000]  Absolutely, this is another practice.
[01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000]  They're getting better at it.
[01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000]  Now, you have to give them credit
[01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000]  because they're getting good at this.
[01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000]  They do it almost undercover.
[01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000]  They take the press out, they go in and do it,
[01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000]  and then the news cleans it up for them.
[01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000]  These people are radicals.
[01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000]  They had a compound, they probably had bombs
[01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000]  in the house, they had weapons in the house
[01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000]  and machine guns.
[01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000]  That's what they did.
[01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000]  They're painting them as demons.
[01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000]  They're not human.
[01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000]  Jack McCallum?
[01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000]  Did we lose Jack?
[01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000]  Apparently, we lost Jack.
[01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000]  You know what, I think he walked away from his mic.
[01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000]  He's probably got some new intel coming in.
[01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000]  Just put him on hold.
[01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000]  Keep him live for when he comes back.
[01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000]  I can hear background stuff
[01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000]  in his compound, his home.
[01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000]  Jack, this is unbelievable.
[01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000]  He's there now.
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000]  Jack, this is just in.
[01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000]  It sounds like disinfo.
[01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000]  This is the first hour.
[01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000]  They could move in, evacuate everybody,
[01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000]  grab this guy off the property,
[01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000]  and then say they're not raiding his house right now.
[01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000]  Clearly, they have surrounded it now
[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000]  for a siege, it looks like.
[01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000]  And to keep the press and media and citizens back,
[01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000]  they're saying it's all over,
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000]  but saying that they're staying in place.
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000]  This from Fox 25.
[01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000]  We've seen this before, haven't we, Jack?
[01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000]  You better believe it.
[01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000]  I was there at Ruby Ridge
[01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000]  and saw the 500 militarized troops there.
[01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000]  What we have here
[01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000]  could very well be
[01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000]  a psyops operation
[01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000]  where they're trying to get us
[01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000]  headed that way
[01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000]  to where they can cause a
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000]  martial law scenario.
[01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000]  So they're putting out this information.
[01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000]  Yeah, I smell a big fat gigantic stinking rat,
[01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000]  which I felt earlier
[01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000]  at the start of the show.
[01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000]  Who knows who we can trust in all of this?
[01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000]  That's right.
[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000]  We can only trust our lord
[01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000]  But anyway,
[01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000]  I'm saying that
[01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000]  it is not over
[01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000]  until we
[01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000]  fire our guns.
[01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000]  Because then the First Amendment
[01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000]  is gone, and they
[01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000]  love that. That's exactly what
[01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000]  they want.
[01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000]  They want us to shut down
[01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000]  the system that's awakening
[01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000]  hundreds of thousands of people a day
[01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000]  across the nation.
[01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000]  We'll be right back.
[01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000]  It's here
[01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000]  after a year in production
[01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000]  and traveling to distant lands.
[01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000]  Shocking declassified government documents
[01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000]  prove that western governments are orchestrating
[01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000]  terror attacks against their own populations
[01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000]  as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000]  Terror Storm proves that not only
[01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000]  was 9-11 an inside job,
[01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000]  but the attacks of 7-7 in London
[01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000]  were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies
[01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000]  that took us to war in Iran.
[01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000]  The White House program to disseminate
[01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000]  fake news, NSA spying,
[01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000]  secret police torture,
[01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000]  the latest 9-11 information,
[01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000]  and much, much more. Terror Storm is
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000]  the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored
[01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000]  terrorism. It's an anthology
[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000]  of government crimes. Terror Storm
[01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000]  is a film that everyone who wants to be truly
[01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000]  informed must see.

[01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000]  Did you ever wonder how an opera
[01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000]  singer that hits a high note is able to shatter
[01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000]  a wine glass? Well, the glass has a natural
[01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000]  resonance. If the resonant frequency
[01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000]  force making the glass vibrate is big enough,
[01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000]  the size of the vibration will become so large
[01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000]  that the glass shatters. Using this
[01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000]  similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered
[01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000]  that disease organisms can be destroyed
[01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000]  using different resonant frequencies.
[01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses
[01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000]  the same technology for relief or elimination
[01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000]  of pain and disease conditions

[01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000]  deep behind enemy lines,
[01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000]  the information war continues.
[01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000]  It's Alex Jones and the
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000]  GCN Radio Network.
[01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000]  We're working on getting a state representative
[01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000]  who's been pro Ed Brown
[01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000]  and Elaine Brown on.
[01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000]  It's clear there's a siege going on.
[01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000]  AP, two newspapers
[01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000]  and two different TV stations.
[01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000]  Three TV
[01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000]  stations have reported
[01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000]  that they have blocked it off
[01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000]  for miles. Evacuating houses have moved
[01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000]  in with now it looks like
[01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000]  hundreds of state and federal
[01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000]  terrorist forces, literally.
[01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000]  Goon military forces.
[01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000]  Look how cowardly they are. Five guys,
[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000]  six guys could go in and
[01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000]  if they were properly trained, just evil
[01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000]  come and deal with a man and a woman.
[01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000]  You saw them
[01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000]  when they get the feds tell them to stand
[01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000]  down and they pulled that off in Virginia
[01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000]  a few months ago. They just do it, waddling
[01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000]  around with their machine guns.
[01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000]  Have they ever run up against anybody who's really ready to engage them?
[01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000]  Those guys are in deep trouble because
[01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000]  their hearts are beating so fast. They're so cowardly.
[01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000]  They don't shift into the animal mode of engaging.
[01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000]  I've sat there and assessed them.
[01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000]  They don't engage most of them.
[01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000]  I've watched old films and talked to old cops
[01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000]  and seen a lot of old street
[01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000]  fight footage and shootouts.
[01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000]  Cops, you should just run in.
[01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000]  Of course, that was because they were going up against bad guys.
[01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000]  They had the good guy attitude.
[01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000]  They had that tribal defense mode.
[01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000]  These other guys are doing it to be bullies and to be tough guys.
[01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000]  You can't be powerful, really powerful
[01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000]  when you're driven by that.
[01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000]  Jack, is that not your experience?
[01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000]  Butch, is that not your experience?
[01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000]  Bullies will bully as long as they can.
[01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000]  I'll make one quick announcement.
[01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000]  On my program tonight, 9 o'clock Eastern,
[01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000]  on Genesis, on different stations,
[01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000]  on broadcast night, I'm going to counsel a guest.
[01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000]  I'm not going to have a guest on.
[01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000]  I'm going to have the lines open for updates on this.
[01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000]  So anybody who wants to call in tonight
[01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000]  on my program at 800-259-5791,
[01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000]  9 p.m. Eastern,
[01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000]  we're going to do an update.
[01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000]  Absolutely. In fact, I'm going to attempt
[01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000]  on the other Genesis shows today to be calling in
[01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000]  and help the different shows with reports.
[01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000]  You too, Alex. You call in.
[01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000]  Please, if you hear anything else.
[01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000]  Jack, you'll never have an hour before I am.
[01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000]  You please feel free to call in to share.
[01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000]  So tonight at 9 o'clock,
[01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000]  we should have a whole lot more story to this.
[01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000]  So my hour will be open tonight at 9 o'clock p.m. Eastern,
[01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000]  800-259-5791.
[01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000]  Continual coverage here on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000]  I want to still get Luke Radowski on,
[01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000]  because he interviewed Ed
[01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000]  three days ago
[01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000]  on Monday before they went to the Republican Convention
[01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000]  and got arrested themselves
[01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000]  with Matt Lipacek and Matt
[01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000]  and everybody else that was witnessed
[01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000]  by the American Freedom of Fascism reporters
[01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000]  there with the Loose Change crew.
[01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000]  And I meant to get the father on
[01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000]  who was standing up against 9-11
[01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000]  with a sign, so the CPS took his son
[01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000]  and said you're not allowed to.
[01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000]  This is key now.
[01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000]  I want to go back and recap everything that's happened
[01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000]  and what we know is happening right now.
[01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000]  But this is key.
[01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000]  A law enforcement technology magazine
[01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000]  four years ago, I'll never forget it,
[01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000]  said this is a federal guideline.
[01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000]  And then they were talking about documents
[01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000]  they'd seen, similar documents we've seen,
[01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000]  we've put out, it's been now in the AP.
[01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000]  But this is some separate stuff that's said
[01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000]  in there.
[01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000]  If someone has a get us out of the UN sticker
[01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000]  on their car, they're a terrorist,
[01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000]  it said are a terrorist, they are to be arrested.
[01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000]  And it said police chiefs
[01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000]  call the feds in,
[01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000]  interrogate them, look for weapons,
[01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000]  at least arrest them and bring them in
[01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000]  for questioning.
[01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000]  Now, Butch, you put out a newsletter that's mainly
[01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000]  mainstream articles, it's really thick, it's excellent,
[01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000]  I get it.
[01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000]  It's just got stuff I never even found,
[01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000]  most of it's mainstream, just a big thick
[01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000]  compilation of news and important things
[01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000]  that happened.
[01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000]  But regardless of what it was,
[01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000]  you now have had two different listeners arrested
[01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000]  who had it, and then you told me,
[01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000]  if I'm correct, you were talking fast,
[01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000]  we were excited, that you called the cops
[01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000]  that did this and they said,
[01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000]  you're going to be arrested?
[01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000]  No, one of the cops from Pennsylvania,
[01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000]  his name is George, called me today.
[01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000]  The cop that stopped him and saw the magazine
[01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000]  said that's subversive material, and this time
[01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000]  of year, you'll be arrested
[01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000]  if that's found in your possession.
[01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000]  Now, didn't you say that somebody else got taken in
[01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000]  for five hours?
[01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000]  Yes, in Ohio, a guy named Howard was at a seminar
[01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000]  this past weekend, was stopped by the police,
[01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000]  they saw the magazine first,
[01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000]  and then they saw a constitution, they saw a roadmap.
[01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000]  They called the FBI
[01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000]  terrorism task force, the FBI,
[01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000]  he's arrested, taken down the police station,
[01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000]  then when the FBI come,
[01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000]  they took him into another office, handcuffed him,
[01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000]  ankle cuffed him to a chair,
[01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000]  and interrogated him for five hours,
[01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000]  and said, well, you look like you're part of a militia
[01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000]  because from our news magazine
[01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000]  is the picture of the man that made it.
[01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000]  Which, by the way, is at state capitals
[01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000]  everywhere in the U.S. capital,
[01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000]  I mean, that's just the symbol of a guy with a gun.
[01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000]  But they said because,
[01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000]  this by the way, as you mentioned,
[01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000]  this brochure has been out for years,
[01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000]  anyone who's called an anti-government group,
[01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000]  if you have, for example, bumpsters that say
[01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000]  gun control equals enslavement,
[01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000]  or the constitution has been subverted,
[01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000]  or you believe in the Bilderberg group,
[01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000]  or an international conspiracy,
[01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000]  let me just stop you, in America,
[01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000]  in the 20 loopholes in the immigration bill,
[01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000]  which, by the way, is not dead, that is pure bull.
[01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000]  Okay, they're going to bring it back up next week.
[01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000]  Okay, just like two weeks ago,
[01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000]  they claimed it was dead and tried to vote it today.
[01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000]  This is the military tactics,
[01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000]  just like they're saying he's not surrounded now,
[01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000]  but everybody's evacuated and he is surrounded
[01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000]  with Ed Brown. This is all military tactics
[01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000]  where they say this is not an assault
[01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000]  as they're killing you, just enough
[01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000]  so you hesitate, that moment of hesitation
[01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000]  and they win. In the bill,
[01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000]  we read the subsections yesterday,
[01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000]  child molestory legal aliens are allowed in,
[01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000]  unlimited, I'm not kidding,
[01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000]  it's in the subsection,
[01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000]  any MS-13 gang members
[01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000]  are allowed in, it actually says it.
[01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000]  Okay, you could not make this up.
[01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000]  It actually says
[01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000]  total blanket amnesty for 12 years,
[01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000]  not 6, they've doubled it,
[01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000]  for anyone that wants to be here, total
[01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000]  unlimited skilled and unskilled visas,
[01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000]  total legalization,
[01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000]  social security cards
[01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000]  on the first visit, unlimited
[01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000]  legalization,
[01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000]  that's all okay.
[01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000]  While these groups run around saying this is Mexico,
[01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000]  and openly saying it on
[01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000]  big radio
[01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000]  stations that aren't even owned by
[01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000]  Mexicans.
[01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000]  But then, if you've got a
[01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000]  pocket constitution, and by the doubts
[01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000]  that it's in road to tyranny, that happened
[01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000]  to Charles and Abbie Newman, they found a pocket constitution,
[01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000]  they found a Harrison Ford
[01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000]  video, Patriot Games, the word Patriot
[01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000]  first got them upset, they're so dumb,
[01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000]  folks, these are state police,
[01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000]  this isn't me, it's on tape, these are so evil.
[01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000]  Okay, but so stupid.
[01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000]  And they say, this is paraphernalia,
[01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000]  this is contraband,
[01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000]  should we charge her for that, and one of them
[01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000]  thinks and goes, maybe she's allowed
[01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000]  to have that, you evil piece of
[01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000]  filth, this is America,
[01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000]  you swore an oath to that, Jack McClam
[01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000]  what is it like for you to know
[01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000]  that cops nationwide, when they see the
[01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000]  constitution, start getting upset,
[01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000]  what is wrong with them, how
[01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000]  in the, I'm going to say, how in the
[01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000]  hell are they that stupid, forgive me,
[01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000]  I'm just going to say, we're about to, the revolution's
[01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000]  on, folks, how have we gotten to this
[01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000]  point, Jack McClam?
[01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000]  Well, brother, I'll tell you, I see
[01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000]  the other side, I see contact
[01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000]  from our police and soldiers that are
[01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000]  waking up to this conspiracy,
[01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000]  and this evil treason
[01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000]  that's going on,
[01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000]  but of course, I do know, we contact
[01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000]  police officers.
[01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000]  You've got a phone off the hook at your office, somebody's listening at your office?
[01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000]  Yeah, what happened is
[01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000]  somebody at your office was listening on the other line,
[01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000]  Jack, can you get them to hang up?
[01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000]  But, if anybody
[01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000]  is listening on the other line, please
[01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000]  hang up.
[01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000]  No, they were listening, and then they didn't
[01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000]  hang it up right, or something's
[01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000]  going on, but Bush, do you have somebody
[01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000]  off the hook?
[01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000]  No, no one's on my
[01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000]  line here, no.
[01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000]  Jack, can you hang up and call us right back?
[01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000]  I've got to do it,
[01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000]  get Jack back on, I want him for the rest of the hour,
[01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000]  but then we can't do this.
[01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000]  I'm on the ISD in Lansing, nobody's on this line.
[01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000]  Yeah, go ahead and let Jack go.
[01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000]  Okay, that's the network
[01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000]  sending me an off the hook tone.
[01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000]  Okay.
[01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.000]  Now, was that the network, or was that Jack?
[01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000]  Okay, getting back, John's doing literally
[01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000]  answering the phones, running the show,
[01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000]  and he is trying
[01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000]  to get me different press reporters, and
[01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000]  different people from inside, so, but Jack,
[01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000]  I think it was Jack's phone actually, because it was really low.
[01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000]  What is it like? I mean, I'm not kidding
[01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000]  cops, maybe you haven't a higher level detective,
[01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000]  or a state trooper, you haven't been in this training.
[01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000]  They say founding fathers are terrorists,
[01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000]  Christians are enemies of America, on video.
[01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000]  I was in Kansas City, in the
[01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000]  classroom, with FEMA teaching it.
[01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000]  We had the preachers on last year,
[01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000]  Bush, where they're teaching them to tell your
[01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000]  martial laws, tell people to turn your guns in.
[01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000]  They're not joking, folks.
[01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000]  They're moving.
[01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000]  That's happening, and by the way, the gentleman who was arrested
[01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000]  in Ohio, asked the FBI agents
[01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000]  when he was being interrogated, didn't you all
[01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000]  not take a note to uphold the Constitution?
[01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000]  Why is it all of a sudden a piece of literature
[01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000]  that's controversial?
[01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000]  No answer, of course, but
[01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000]  this again, is obviously,
[01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000]  as Jack said, this is probably a
[01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000]  he said, a psychop, I have no doubt this is,
[01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000]  it is mind control, that this is
[01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000]  mind control, this is people control.
[01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000]  Fear is control.
[01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000]  And we don't fear, but I realize
[01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000]  obviously neither does Edna Lane.
[01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000]  But again, Jack talked about the first
[01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000]  amendment, I'm all for that, how about the
[01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000]  first amendment, but how about the second amendment?
[01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000]  What's it there for?
[01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000]  I mean, is it there for us to
[01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000]  hold reserve until they murder some
[01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000]  more of us? I don't know, I'm asking a question.
[01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000]  This is a sincere question on my heart and mind.
[01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.000]  Well, all I'm saying is we need to wait and see what happens.
[01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000]  I agree. That's why tonight at 9 o'clock,
[01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000]  please, tonight, tune in to our broadcast.
[01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000]  I understand, but we will.
[01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000]  We're going to plug that before you leave us.
[01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000]  I've got a bunch of other
[01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000]  numbers and contacts here for reporters.
[01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000]  Do we have Jack McClan back?
[01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000]  Okay, we'll get him back on.
[01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000]  And Luke Radowski also interviewed
[01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000]  him, Infowars.com reporter on Monday.
[01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000]  That video interview is up on the web.
[01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000]  We're getting links to that. Continual coverage of all this
[01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000]  at PrisonPlanet.com. And don't forget,
[01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000]  we're going to have a protest against the New World
[01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000]  Order, against Waco, and against what's
[01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000]  happened to Ed and Elaine Brown tonight
[01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000]  here in Austin, Texas at the Governor's Mansion
[01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000]  with the Bilderberg traitor, Rick Perry.
[01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000]  I'm calling for a Logan Act investigation
[01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000]  of clear felony violation of it.
[01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000]  I'm calling for an
[01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000]  official investigation by grand juries
[01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000]  of this, and we're going to be down there
[01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000]  tonight exposing the Governor.
[01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000]  I mean, we're in their face, folks. We're asking
[01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000]  for it. That's what we're doing.
[01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000]  And we're putting ourselves in the
[01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000]  way of the fist, but that's... They're intimidated
[01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.000]  right now as well. They're trying to make their move.
[01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000]  7 o'clock, down there in front of the Governor's Mansion,
[01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000]  right off 11th Street. Just go to the Capitol.
[01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.000]  Go to the Governor's Mansion. You can't miss it.
[01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000]  I want to see you there tonight. Call through your friends and bring them.
[01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000]  I know it's spontaneous. I just announced it yesterday.
[01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000]  I want to see everybody there today.
[01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000]  I want to see you there at 7 o'clock.
[01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000]  And then I'll call in and report
[01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000]  to you, Butch, later.
[01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000]  I've got a bunch of other numbers here
[01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000]  to call
[01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000]  with people that have talked to
[01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000]  Ed and Elaine Brown.
[01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000]  Reportedly, we'll find
[01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000]  out what happens there.
[01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000]  We know this. The feds and the state
[01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000]  police with armored vehicles, drones,
[01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000]  helicopters moved in. We know
[01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000]  drones. A drone was there last night.
[01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000]  We know they evacuated for upwards
[01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000]  of over a mile. It says for several
[01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000]  miles in the newspaper that they've got checkpoints
[01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000]  blocking people. They're saying, don't worry.
[01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000]  We're not raiding this compound.
[01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000]  I understand that, Alex. A mile away
[01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000]  in New Hampshire, they can't see
[01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000]  anything. It's wooded. It's hilly.
[01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000]  It's not like a mile away in Texas where
[01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000]  it's flat level some places. No one can
[01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.000]  get them with any kind of camera too far away.
[01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000]  Well, in Waco, they kept them a mile and a half away, but the
[01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000]  Germans still got the video of them.
[01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000]  New Hampshire's
[01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000]  so wooded, though, they can't see that far away.
[01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000]  Let's do it by airplane.
[01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000]  You know, this is where the Patriots fought the
[01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000]  Redcoats, right there in the same spot.
[01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000]  The live, free, or die state, and that's
[01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000]  what Ed Brown
[01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.000]  and Elaine Brown are doing right now. Continual
[01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000]  coverage as new developments
[01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000]  break on the other side.
[01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000]  Now, you can bring
[01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000]  Berkey purification power anywhere
[01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.000]  with the Sport Berkey filtration bottle.
[01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000]  Ideal for sporting games, camping,
[01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000]  or boating, or Sport Berkey is small enough
[01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000]  to store in your glove box, so it's
[01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000]  ideal backup for unexpected emergencies
[01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000]  like blackouts, floods, or earthquakes.
[01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.000]  It's simply the best personal water
[01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.000]  filtration system available. So effective
[01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000]  you can drink raw, untreated water from
[01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000]  lakes, rivers, and streams. Unlike other
[01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000]  sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented
[01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000]  filter formulation is so powerful it
[01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000]  removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria,
[01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000]  and chemicals like herbicides
[01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.000]  and pesticides. It even reduces
[01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000]  radon-222, lead, and other
[01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.000]  heavy metals. This lightweight, rugged 22
[01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000]  ounce filter is small enough to go
[01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.000]  everywhere, so take one to work and
[01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.000]  keep another in your glove box for emergencies.

[01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000]  Ted Anderson, for Midas Resources,
[01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000]  June 7, 2007, gold
[01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000]  688-83 ounce gold coins can be
[01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.000]  purchased for 689-83,
[01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000]  340-35 for half, 170-18
[01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000]  for quarter, that's 689-83,
[01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000]  340-15, and 170-18.
[01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.000]  70% of China's
[01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.000]  1 trillion reserves are in dollar, now
[01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.000]  purchasing 250,000 barrels of oil
[01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000]  per day from Iran in Euro. Japanese
[01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000]  refiners buy 550,000 barrels
[01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000]  by switching dollar to yen. Bad news for
[01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000]  U.S. currency. China and Japan hold large
[01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.000]  positions in dollar. Trading equals
[01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000]  permanent loss. Dollars fall into 65%
[01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000]  of Euro. Erosion accelerates.
[01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.000]  Countries despise imperialistic policy
[01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:20.000]  of U.S. loss of confidence
[01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000]  causing more selling. GAO is warning
[01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.000]  about the debt spiraling out of control.

[01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:54.000]  Proto-Gro is a bioactive superfood for
[01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.000]  plants that works by providing true broad
[01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000]  spectrum nutrition, allowing plants to achieve their
[01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000]  full genetic expression. What does this mean
[01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000]  in the garden? It means mouthwatering fruits and vegetables,

[01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000]  building blocks of life itself. In fact,
[01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000]  Proto-Gro is so effective at producing rapid
[01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000]  plant growth in record time that it almost forces
[01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000]  plants to grow even under the worst light and
[01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:26.000]  soil conditions. It's also perfect for growing
[01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.000]  your own survival foods, and might just be the
[01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.000]  ultimate hard times barter item. To grow

[01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000]  Day after day
[01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000]  Alone on a hill
[01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000]  We don't know what the truth is.
[01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000]  We know the feds have surrounded, they've evacuated
[01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:58.000]  for over a mile.
[01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000]  We know there's armored vehicles, helicopters,
[01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000]  paramilitary,
[01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:04.000]  terror forces. Literally, these are America
[01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.000]  killing forces.
[01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.000]  These are occupiers of the foreign banks
[01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:10.000]  that completely own this country and have run us into the ground
[01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:12.000]  by design and demonized our name
[01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.000]  worldwide.
[01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.000]  Now, U.S. Marshal is saying they've served a search
[01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000]  warrant on his wife's
[01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000]  dental office and
[01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000]  that they've surrounded the house but they're not
[01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000]  planning to raid it. Total lie.
[01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.000]  They're just waiting to see what happens.
[01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.000]  Who knows? There was a report
[01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000]  that
[01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000]  Butch got that the place had been burnt down.
[01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.000]  We know they do that. That was unconfirmed.
[01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.000]  We don't know.
[01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000]  There's an individual named Drew Raines who I'm told
[01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.000]  has talked many times to the Browns and been
[01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000]  in contact with them and talked to them today.
[01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.000]  I don't know if that's the case.
[01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000]  We tried cell phone numbers and our home number we have and weren't able to
[01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.000]  get them. He'll be on with us in a few minutes.
[01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:50.000]  We'll see what's happening there.
[01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.000]  I know that Luke Radowski, Infowars.com
[01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:54.000]  reporter met with him
[01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.000]  on
[01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.000]  Monday,
[01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:00.000]  one of the last big interviews he's done, so we'll
[01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.000]  get Luke on in about 10 minutes with
[01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.000]  Matt Lepacek and others.
[01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.000]  But going back to Jack McClam,
[01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:08.000]  Jack, when you were gone a few minutes, did you
[01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000]  learn anything else or anything going on?
[01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000]  No, no, brother. Our phones
[01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000]  are ringing and ringing and ringing
[01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:16.000]  here in the office and Carol is
[01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.000]  trying to take care of the calls while I'm on
[01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000]  the radio, but nothing new
[01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000]  has come in. We just know that
[01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000]  we're trying to get people to
[01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.000]  call their state representatives
[01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000]  there and tell them not
[01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.000]  to allow the feds to do another
[01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.000]  Waco or Ruby Ridge there
[01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.000]  and call the sheriff's office
[01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.000]  even though Barbara, the girl I talked to
[01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:38.000]  there, the secretary, said she was the only one
[01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.000]  there because they're out on this
[01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.000]  scene. Said she was going
[01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000]  to take the phone off the hook, but I think we
[01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.000]  should still continue to try to call
[01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:48.000]  and let them know we're concerned.
[01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:50.000]  Absolutely. In fact, on Infowars.com
[01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.000]  and PrisonPlanet.com
[01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.000]  we'll post the phone numbers
[01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.000]  and continual coverage is
[01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000]  all there. On the sides, Paul Watson,
[01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.000]  Steve Watson, Ryan Slickhides, and Aaron
[01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:02.000]  Dykes. They're all working around the clock.
[01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.000]  Total coverage on this at JonesReport.com
[01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000]  I know Aaron will be here till about 2 in the
[01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000]  morning tonight. On that, we've got
[01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000]  our protest coming up at 7. It's good to have
[01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.000]  multi-state protests. Call all the
[01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000]  Texas media. You ask why?
[01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.000]  This is where Waco happened. We're protesting.
[01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.000]  Don't have another Waco against
[01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:20.000]  for national
[01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000]  intention. We don't want another Waco in Texas.
[01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.000]  They're protesting. We're shifting
[01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:26.000]  the protests we're having for Bilderberg Grip
[01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000]  over to that. It's very important
[01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000]  that everybody call. Don't wait for me to give you the number.
[01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:32.000]  Just get New Hampshire information.
[01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.000]  In fact, two days ago
[01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000]  we put out the state police numbers, or actually
[01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.000]  yesterday. I had the sheriff's
[01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.000]  number right here.
[01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:42.000]  I think the governor's office is the place
[01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.000]  because when they were going to raid the Gray family
[01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.000]  and had the armored vehicles and the
[01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.000]  cameras and the people already,
[01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:50.000]  we went out there back in 1999
[01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.000]  and when
[01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.000]  all the other patriots were cowardly and didn't go out there,
[01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.000]  I was in there alone.
[01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:58.000]  Of course, I'm evil later.
[01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:00.000]  They backed off and
[02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.000]  stopped because the governor
[02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:04.000]  told them to stop. Of course, that was
[02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:06.000]  Rick Perry who had just gotten in.
[02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.000]  He was the proviso governor. I guess that was in 2000
[02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:10.000]  then and hadn't been elected
[02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:12.000]  yet, but that's how long that piece of filth's been in here.
[02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.000]  Go ahead, Jack, or go ahead
[02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:16.000]  and comment.
[02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:18.000]  Yes, I have the sheriff.
[02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:20.000]  Okay, let's go ahead.
[02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000]  I just had Crystal here in the office
[02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000]  check the news channels, Fox News, CNN.
[02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:26.000]  She's checked them. The headline on those
[02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:28.000]  channels is Paris Hilton
[02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000]  got out of jail because she got
[02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.000]  a rice. That's what's in the news on there.
[02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:34.000]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:36.000]  Well, I have the sheriff's
[02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:38.000]  number here, Alex. Let me give that out.
[02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:40.000]  The sheriff's name is Michael
[02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.000]  Prozo
[02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:44.000]  P-R-O-Z-Z-O
[02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:46.000]  and he's
[02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.000]  conveniently out of town, they say,
[02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:50.000]  but his number is 603
[02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:52.000]  area code
[02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:54.000]  863
[02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:56.000]  4200.
[02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:58.000]  I think we ought to just burn the phone line up
[02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.000]  and tell the sheriff's deputies
[02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000]  and anybody there to be out there
[02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.000]  and keep control.
[02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:06.000]  Stay there, gentlemen. I'm going to put you on hold
[02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.000]  because we can't bring up three people at the same time.
[02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.000]  Drew Rains, and now that
[02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:12.000]  name rings a bell. I know he's...
[02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:14.000]  I haven't even co-hosted for you, Jack, and my memory
[02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:16.000]  serves me correctly. Drew,
[02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.000]  exactly who have you talked to? Have you talked to
[02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:20.000]  the Browns? Do you know what's going on? Thanks for coming on.
[02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.000]  I appreciate the invite
[02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.000]  and yeah, you're right. I do stand in
[02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.000]  for Jack McClam. He's my favorite officer out there.
[02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.000]  And I know you just love me
[02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:30.000]  to death, too. Now, that's a show...
[02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:32.000]  The bottom line here is
[02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.000]  with all hatred or all
[02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.000]  any animosity
[02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.000]  against anybody out there,
[02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:40.000]  this is a day of problems
[02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:42.000]  in America and we as American people need to
[02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.000]  stand up. And yes, I did get a phone call
[02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.000]  20 minutes before my
[02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.000]  personal show ended today
[02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:50.000]  from somebody inside the house
[02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:52.000]  and they told me
[02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:54.000]  that they
[02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:56.000]  were surrounded and blocked off
[02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:58.000]  and that
[02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:00.000]  the mainline telephone was dead and they were
[02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:02.000]  calling from the emergency cell phone number
[02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:04.000]  that was given to them
[02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:06.000]  or a cell phone that was given to them by a
[02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.000]  personal friend of mine who is in a
[02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:10.000]  militia unit there in Vermont.
[02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:12.000]  Okay, stay there, stay there, but I need to understand
[02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.000]  who is in the house.
[02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:16.000]  We'll find out on the
[02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:18.000]  other side with Drew Rains.
[02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.000]  I'm Alex Jones. Stay with us.
[02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:34.000]  We're on the march.
[02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:36.000]  The empire's on the run.
[02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:38.000]  Alex Jones and the
[02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.000]  GCN Radio Network.
[02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:44.000]  Attention,
[02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:46.000]  women over 40. If you want to look
[02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.000]  as much as 20 years younger in less
[02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:50.000]  than one minute, this will be the most
[02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:52.000]  important message you will ever hear.
[02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:54.000]  Here's why. There's a brand new cosmetic product
[02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:56.000]  that makes wrinkles almost invisible
[02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:58.000]  to the naked eye. In fact, the new product
[02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:00.000]  allows some women to look so young so
[02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:02.000]  fast that it makes them feel like they're cheating.
[02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:04.000]  They are in a way, but it works.
[02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:06.000]  By the way, it's also a jealously
[02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.000]  guarded secret used by professional models.
[02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:10.000]  You see, these women often have to look
[02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:12.000]  much younger than they really are or else
[02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:14.000]  they lose their jobs. The product uses
[02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:16.000]  something like a magician's trick to actually
[02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.000]  de-age the appearance of human skin
[02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:20.000]  and it's now available to listeners at
[02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:22.000]  this station. Want to take years off your
[02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.000]  appearance and don't want cosmetic surgery
[02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.000]  or painful injections? There is now a
[02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:28.000]  very real chance you can do it with this
[02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:30.000]  new cream called simply Magician's Formula
[02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:32.000]  987. Just go to
[02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:34.000]  987magic.com. That's
[02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:36.000]  987magic.com or call
[02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.000]  877-327-0365.
[02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:42.000]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.000]  Government is best
[02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.000]  which governs least. Wake up and smell the
[02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000]  fascism. Being in government means
[02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.000]  never having to say you're sorry.
[02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:52.000]  What part of unconstitutional do not understand,
[02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:54.000]  George? In today's world
[02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.000]  full of tyranny and injustice,
[02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.000]  sometimes it seems the only thing we still
[02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:00.000]  have is our freedom of speech.
[02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:02.000]  Exercise your freedom of speech
[02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.000]  by purchasing your choice of hundreds of
[02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:06.000]  different Liberty Stickers from Humorous

[02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.000]  discusses two vital questions.
[02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:58.000]  War in Iran?
[02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:00.000]  A coming One World Church?
[02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:02.000]  In the first issue is included
[02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:04.000]  a pungent discussion of
