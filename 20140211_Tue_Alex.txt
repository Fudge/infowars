[24:58.260 --> 25:03.460]  against them and let me quantify why i'm making such a big deal out of gun owners being persecuted
[25:03.460 --> 25:09.380]  everywhere bloomberg being caught in secret meetings 50 mayors quitting more today when they
[25:09.380 --> 25:14.580]  said the plan is to register and confiscate they're trying to line up the cities the states
[25:14.580 --> 25:23.140]  everybody for the criminal takeover and here's the big news the military and the police have been
[25:23.140 --> 25:28.820]  trained covertly and directed for war with the american people with the key officer level
[25:28.820 --> 25:36.420]  cadres for 20 plus years conservatively now they have expanded it down to the lower ranks
[25:37.220 --> 25:43.140]  have given uh civil unrest and gun confiscation training almost all of the armed services at
[25:43.140 --> 25:50.180]  every level and are accelerating demonization propaganda brainwashing not against just guns
[25:50.180 --> 25:55.380]  like holder ordered the media to do we have that clip of him publicly on c span saying it
[25:55.380 --> 26:01.140]  so they have to act in the open like it's no big deal because it's so outrageous this is a criminal
[26:01.140 --> 26:06.020]  racketeering conspiracy against this free country this is a foreign banking coup d'etat
[26:07.140 --> 26:12.420]  with a bunch of socialist communists and other people who have a real score to settle with americana
[26:13.700 --> 26:18.980]  who are going to be the enforcers literally persecuting the living daylights out of people
[26:18.980 --> 26:23.060]  and it will become a self-filling prophecy where people have no other choice but to fight back
[26:23.780 --> 26:29.460]  see we're then going to be the terrorists they are lining the country up for civil war
[26:31.300 --> 26:36.260]  directed by the occupied federal government and they are going operational everywhere
[26:36.260 --> 26:41.860]  preparing the police and telling them veterans are going to ied your police department and your

[27:10.820 --> 27:16.500]  you'll play along with it when they blow up a sports stadium or a dam or a school or new
[27:16.500 --> 27:21.460]  city and say the patriots did it and you'll line up and you'll go out and you'll arrest and
[27:22.100 --> 27:26.420]  hand us over to the mercenaries who'll go kill us it ain't going to happen like that
[27:27.300 --> 27:32.180]  people very quickly are not going to just sit there when you come they're going to go on the
[27:32.180 --> 27:37.140]  offense which is the best defense and they're going to roll out and no amount of hardware
[27:37.140 --> 27:45.460]  is going to help you i mean you can't hold bag dad with 300 000 us trips 100 000 i'm in bag dad
[27:46.820 --> 27:51.540]  you think you're going to hold this country we've already identified you everybody already sees
[27:51.540 --> 27:57.460]  you're not cloaked you're not operating in the dark you're operating at high noon and everybody
[27:57.460 --> 28:03.460]  sees it coming down and my job is to back these people off and to be bold enough to tell it like
[28:03.460 --> 28:10.020]  it is to be bold enough to be honest to risk my life so that we have a chance to stop these people
[28:10.020 --> 28:15.140]  and the least you can do if you work in the system as a bureaucrat as a data miner as a police
[28:15.140 --> 28:22.180]  officer as a psychologist as a doctor as a social worker as a teacher as a bureaucrat as a banker
[28:22.180 --> 28:29.140]  is start leaking intel to the people start not complying quietly and the system counts on compliance
[28:29.140 --> 28:35.540]  it's basically weak you empower it you've got to speak out against it you've got to identify friends
[28:35.540 --> 28:39.620]  and people that know what's going on you've got to start resisting you've got to create under
[28:39.620 --> 28:45.860]  known diplomas your own website your own youtube's your own pen names you can operate publicly not
[28:45.860 --> 28:51.780]  publicly but the general public has to look in the mirror and not just blame the bureaucracy we let
[28:51.780 --> 28:58.100]  this bureaucracy turn into this you want to know who the problem is look in the mirror as v from v

[29:10.900 --> 29:16.660]  used to um but people use this place like a library it's not bad but stuff comes and goes the point
[29:16.660 --> 29:22.500]  is is that um it's the part where he says i know why you did it you wanted to be easy you wanted to
[29:22.500 --> 29:26.260]  believe everything was okay you wanted to give your liberty over to somebody else to protect you
[29:26.260 --> 29:30.900]  but now you know you're a slave what are you going to do about it oh there are some that are more
[29:30.900 --> 29:35.860]  guilty than others and they will be dealt with but if you want to know who's really behind it look

[33:28.980 --> 33:34.740]  for the emergency challenge i do like many of you appreciate the comforts of the everyday routine
[33:34.740 --> 33:41.460]  all the security of the familiar the tranquility repetition lody hell i enjoy them as much as any
[33:41.460 --> 33:47.940]  bloke but in the spirit of commemoration whereby those important events of the past usually associated
[33:47.940 --> 33:53.300]  with someone's death or the end of some awful bloody struggle are celebrated with a nice holiday
[33:54.100 --> 34:00.180]  i thought we could mark this november the fifth a day that is sadly no longer remembered by taking
[34:00.180 --> 34:05.540]  some time out of our daily lives to sit down and have a little chat there are of course those who
[34:05.540 --> 34:11.380]  do not want us to speak we think just let me say that even now orders are being shouted into telephones
[34:11.380 --> 34:18.020]  and men with guns will soon be on their way it's chances that that's why because while the traction
[34:18.020 --> 34:24.740]  may be used in lieu of conversation words will always retain their power words offer the means
[34:24.740 --> 34:31.220]  to meaning and for those who will listen the enunciation of truth and the truth is there is
[34:31.220 --> 34:36.340]  something terribly wrong with this country isn't that you designed it sir you wanted it foolproof
[34:36.340 --> 34:42.100]  you taught me every television in longer cruelty and injustice intolerance and depression and where
[34:42.100 --> 34:47.300]  once you have the freedom to object to the thing can speak as you saw fit you now have sensors and
[34:47.300 --> 34:53.140]  systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and setting your submachine cameras how did this
[34:53.140 --> 34:59.220]  happen who's to blame well certainly there are those who are more responsible than others they
[34:59.220 --> 35:05.220]  will be held accountable but again truth be told if you're looking for the guilty you need only
[35:05.220 --> 35:14.340]  look into a mirror i know why you did it i know you were afraid who wouldn't be war terror disease
[35:14.900 --> 35:20.420]  there were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common
[35:20.420 --> 35:27.140]  sense fear got the best of you and in your panic you turned to the now high chancellor adam subtler
[35:27.140 --> 35:32.660]  he promised you order he promised you peace and all he demanded in return was your silent
[35:32.660 --> 35:39.060]  obedient consent inspector you're almost through last night i sought to end that silence last night
[35:39.060 --> 35:46.740]  i destroyed the old bailey to remind this country of what it has forgotten more than 400 years ago
[35:46.740 --> 35:52.100]  a great citizen wished to embed the fifth of november forever in our memory his hope was to
[35:52.100 --> 35:59.460]  remind the world that fairness justice and freedom are more than words they are perspectives so if
[35:59.460 --> 36:06.180]  you've seen nothing if the crimes of this government remain unknown to you then i would suggest that
[36:06.180 --> 36:14.180]  you allow the fifth of november to pass unmarked but if you see what i see if you feel as i feel
[36:14.820 --> 36:21.220]  and if you would seek as i seek then i ask you to stand beside me one year from tonight outside
[36:21.220 --> 36:27.780]  the gates of parliament and together we shall give them a fifth of november that shall never ever be
[36:27.780 --> 36:42.660]  forgotten ladies and gentlemen the bottom line is this no army can stop an idea whose time has come
[36:42.660 --> 36:54.660]  no army can stop an idea whose time has come and ideas my friends are bulletproof
[37:12.740 --> 37:14.660]  north america
[37:18.820 --> 37:25.300]  there is a war it's happening now it will decide the fate of humanity the time the
[37:25.300 --> 37:34.260]  true science has come we are the resistance we are the info war you are the info war ladies and
[37:34.260 --> 37:41.140]  gentlemen ahead of david eich joining us and ahead of dr group being in studio dr ebert group
[37:41.140 --> 37:47.460]  i won't open the phones up right now to police currently serving in the homeland
[37:48.820 --> 37:56.500]  and to currently serving military or recently out that could be the last decade who've been part
[37:56.500 --> 38:04.100]  of these now public drills where the gun owners libertarians veterans again number one enemy
[38:04.100 --> 38:11.860]  returning veterans are are cast as the bad guy i mean imagine if they were having drills where
[38:11.860 --> 38:18.420]  black people are going to go kill everybody at the school or where hispanics are or where catholics
[38:18.420 --> 38:24.260]  were or jews were there would be an incredible outcry but oh veterans as a group oh gun owners
[38:24.820 --> 38:31.620]  oh libertarians oh conservatives oh bob bar supporters remember that the mic report
[38:31.620 --> 38:37.540]  or oh ron paul supporters yeah oh they're terrorist police go ahead and arrest them i saw that in
[38:37.540 --> 38:41.780]  law enforcement magazine years ago it said you know they gotta in get us out of the un sticker
[38:41.780 --> 38:46.740]  from the john birch society go ahead and take them in and chiefs you support them we're sure
[38:46.740 --> 38:51.860]  there's something they're doing wrong statistically folks john birchers are probably the lowest crime
[38:51.860 --> 38:57.060]  rate of anybody out there and everybody knows that who studies history criminology i mean i
[38:57.060 --> 39:00.420]  can't think of more upstanding people in the john birchers i've done in my life i'm not even part
[39:00.420 --> 39:07.860]  of the group but they list them as evil terrorists basically the more upstanding you are the more
[39:07.860 --> 39:13.700]  you won't sell out the stronger you are the more committed you are of course you're listed as an
[39:13.700 --> 39:20.420]  enemy by this criminal takeover of course clean cut hardworking veterans that own businesses are
[39:20.420 --> 39:26.740]  being watched because they're scared of you these crooks are scared of men and women who have honor
[39:26.740 --> 39:35.220]  in their hearts and who want freedom and we're being listed as the terrorist i am listed as it is
[39:35.220 --> 39:42.500]  someone who wants a violence and a revolution on msnbc and cnn because i tell them i know you're
[39:42.500 --> 39:49.620]  preparing for war with us and if you try it 1776 will commence again those aren't just words we're
[39:49.620 --> 39:55.460]  taking action they said there's no open carry in san Antonio we don't care what the state law is
[39:55.460 --> 39:58.740]  and over a thousand people marched down there in defiance of the police backed off
[40:00.020 --> 40:04.980]  and did their duty but after we left that night they arrested somebody open carrying right there
[40:07.060 --> 40:12.180]  it's disgusting they think they're playing it safe they're not playing it safe
[40:13.540 --> 40:18.420]  you gotta do like the sheriff of liberty county florida he read the statute on air with us i read
[40:18.420 --> 40:24.900]  the statute when he got arrested these sheriff and it said if someone's going to or from work
[40:24.900 --> 40:30.260]  or transporting money they can have a concealed firearm in the vehicle for their security without
[40:30.260 --> 40:36.100]  a permit but if you feel that they were transporting it outside of that it's written where they could
[40:36.100 --> 40:40.580]  have written it's a bad statute he said listen you arrested this guy with no criminal record for
[40:40.580 --> 40:47.780]  a gun coming from his work let him go he said to his deputies you you want to carry guns off
[40:47.780 --> 40:54.740]  2d2 don't you you like i mean let him go get rid of that fake report they arrested him the governor
[40:54.740 --> 41:01.780]  tried to make sure he went to jail the jury no building the jury said not guilty grand jury
[41:01.780 --> 41:07.940]  with no bill it was the jury in the court trial because they're afraid of the enforcers deciding
[41:07.940 --> 41:13.380]  to follow their oath they're scared to death so they want to intimidate you that little police
[41:13.380 --> 41:21.380]  chief out in that small town of new mexico when he got to the airport to fly into los vegas to be
[41:21.380 --> 41:28.260]  part of a constitutional sheriff's meeting and he went in there and they harassed him and sent
[41:28.260 --> 41:32.900]  the feds in trying to get him fired and the fed was there knowing what he was going to knowing
[41:32.900 --> 41:38.100]  what he was doing and then now a lady's reading a conservative jewish newspaper and they interrogate
[41:38.100 --> 41:44.100]  her for 30 minutes and rifle or stuff they're thought police folks when i go to the airport
[41:45.140 --> 41:48.980]  the low-level ts they'll be like oh hi alex how you doing and the manager will walk over and go
[41:48.980 --> 41:54.420]  well jones where you going and what you're planning and i'll say well you know you've got my ticket
[41:54.420 --> 41:59.620]  answer my questions if you want to fly it's all about lining me up teaching me i'm a criminal
[41:59.620 --> 42:04.660]  teaching me and next is come with us and that's already starting come with us at the airport
[42:04.660 --> 42:09.140]  that's an internal checkpoint and you disappear and then oh don't say anything about alex they
[42:09.140 --> 42:14.340]  might get you know we all got to stand together against this evil of illegitimate criminals
[42:14.340 --> 42:17.940]  they will succeed and take over if you're afraid of them folks
[42:19.940 --> 42:25.460]  you should be scared to death of not taking action history facts my gut everything says
[42:25.460 --> 42:31.380]  fight these people head on call them out speak out against them and the minute the reason they'll
[42:31.380 --> 42:35.060]  come after is when they stage a false flag and i know that is they know we've got reporters and
[42:35.060 --> 42:39.300]  myself and auxiliary reporters around the country that are going to go to their press conferences
[42:39.300 --> 42:43.780]  when they stage a boston bombing or an event we're going to have our people there in hours
[42:43.780 --> 42:48.740]  we're going to expose the drills the setup we're going to get the uh photos the fbi says don't
[42:48.740 --> 42:53.540]  look at they had secret service when obama was even there come and threaten dan badandi
[42:54.180 --> 42:59.540]  with all sorts of bodily harm if he kept asking questions at the in the press conference about
[42:59.540 --> 43:04.660]  the drill and the fbi looked at the media and they said you do not talk to this man or look at his
[43:04.660 --> 43:10.100]  photos and the media literally saluted except a few national media come over and said we know it's
[43:10.100 --> 43:14.100]  a drill they're killing people they're finding them dead in the rivers man you you know you've
[43:14.100 --> 43:19.140]  got a lot of courage people can make jokes about people like badandi because he's a real normal
[43:19.140 --> 43:23.460]  guy and everything is you know up there with his east coast accent but he's a real guy who's got
[43:23.460 --> 43:28.020]  courage not once not twice but three times they have feds come up sort bumping into him going
[43:28.020 --> 43:32.020]  you better watch it punk you know something's going to happen he said fine do whatever you're
[43:32.020 --> 43:35.140]  going to do i'm going to ask the questions because he's not a coward
[43:38.100 --> 43:42.660]  you people in this gang system that think you know you've got all the power because you've got the
[43:42.660 --> 43:48.500]  system you've got all this power from sucking off the people and you've got a traitor government
[43:48.500 --> 43:53.780]  saying the veterans and gun owners are the number one threat that's like hitler did
[43:53.780 --> 44:05.700]  this is so flaming tyrannical this is on fire with evil this is outrageous outrageous how naked
[44:05.700 --> 44:16.260]  this is how brazen how belligerent and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to know they've already
[44:16.260 --> 44:22.420]  done all the tv conditioning all of it they're playing i'm open the phone number up for police
[44:22.420 --> 44:26.260]  and military and i'll go right to you because we got david ike coming up i want to hear what you
[44:26.260 --> 44:33.700]  think about a guy with a shotgun case spent casing literally that they dug through all of his
[44:33.700 --> 44:37.540]  hunting and fishing stuff and you know and found it in a vest he'd forgotten to take out
[44:38.340 --> 44:43.300]  and they're going to try to put him in jail for years in dc i want to know what you think about
[44:43.300 --> 44:47.460]  bloomberg getting caught in secret meetings saying once we register we're going to ban i want to know
[44:47.460 --> 44:52.660]  what you think about the federal grants you get where you go and you train at public schools to
[44:52.660 --> 44:57.700]  condition the kids that the gun owners are going to come kill everybody because they're mad about
[44:57.700 --> 45:02.340]  the second amendment being violated and they're going to use bio weapons that the school biology
[45:02.340 --> 45:08.660]  teachers are terrorist they had some glitter on a poster out in california a few months ago
[45:08.660 --> 45:13.060]  and some of it blew and they said you're trying to make people think there's a bio attack they've
[45:13.060 --> 45:17.220]  got people where there's a backpack on the ground i mean i've been at the airport before and walked
[45:17.220 --> 45:23.540]  off of my bags get a coffee and people are like hey your bags i'm like starbucks is 10 feet i know
[45:24.180 --> 45:28.340]  my crew's sitting right by the bag lady it's always a woman nothing against women but they're
[45:28.340 --> 45:34.820]  the ones that are more congenial and tribal situations to try to comply and be nice people
[45:34.820 --> 45:40.340]  the problem is you got evil running the country and repeatedly i have had one time at austin
[45:40.340 --> 45:46.100]  berksham i got up to go get some barbecue i mean uh some some utensils for my barbecue and i was
[45:46.100 --> 45:51.220]  waiting to fly out and a woman again went sir sir you don't leave your bag and it was literally 15
[45:51.220 --> 45:58.340]  feet to the paper towels and utensils this woman is shaking in fear that that there's terrorist
[45:58.340 --> 46:02.180]  everywhere when the government runs the terrorist publicly on record and that's all out in the open
[46:02.180 --> 46:08.020]  now so they're seguling from forget al qaeda why it's the gun owners i mean this is incredible
[46:09.140 --> 46:14.020]  and we've got to make this break into the media and have a serious talk about this and remember
[46:14.020 --> 46:20.180]  what came out last year we first broke it leaked to us actually out of a psyops group i mean i'll
[46:20.180 --> 46:22.660]  just say it because they're all being tracked they know what they're not in i don't care
[46:24.020 --> 46:30.340]  out of uh ford hood where they said the evangelical christians are criminals you're not to give
[46:30.340 --> 46:33.620]  money or go to one of their churches or be part of the tea party or you will be called before
[46:33.620 --> 46:38.740]  the man in court marshal and then fox news picked it up and they went okay the secretary of the
[46:38.740 --> 46:45.060]  army said we're going to stop that now man i mean imagine that this is like a soviet takeover folks
[46:45.060 --> 46:50.740]  this is the real deal ahead of them going operational and then all hell's going to break loose
[46:50.740 --> 46:56.820]  forever basically the end of our way of life the end of prosperity dead citizens dead police
[46:56.820 --> 47:02.580]  dead military hell on earth i mean this is a nightmare situation where the globalist play us
[47:02.580 --> 47:06.260]  off against each other so at the end of this segment the next segment and the next one

[48:57.700 --> 49:02.340]  babbling in 18 other directions i'm so freaked out about how obvious all this is and the fact
[49:02.340 --> 49:06.100]  that we've got to get the public to realize this is happening that can hardly even talk at some
[49:06.100 --> 49:11.620]  points let's go to steve who's in pennsylvania and i guess his active duty active duty military
[49:11.620 --> 49:15.780]  steve what is your take on all this do you think i'm wrong or what do you think
[49:18.420 --> 49:23.060]  let's uh pot steve up there uh on the network for me real quick uh go ahead steve you're on the
[49:23.060 --> 49:33.540]  year yeah yes yes go ahead yeah you're you're dead on um i was in the military for six years
[49:33.540 --> 49:41.940]  i just got out the other year um and i woke up beginning the last year and it seems like
[49:41.940 --> 49:49.060]  everything you've been saying for the past year or so has been right on no doubt about it and i can't
[49:49.060 --> 49:54.500]  even believe a real takeover is being attempted right now even i can't believe it's really happening
[49:54.500 --> 49:57.780]  even though we saw all the signs and even though it's happened in other countries over and over
[49:57.780 --> 50:04.900]  again but it's so crazy imagine the majority of drills are for veterans and gun owners killing
[50:04.900 --> 50:10.180]  children to demonize veterans gun owners and conservatives i mean this is outrageous where
[50:10.180 --> 50:16.820]  is the republican party hauling the attorney general up for impeachment right now well you
[50:16.820 --> 50:24.180]  can't trust either party i know they're they're they're the problem is they're both you know
[50:24.180 --> 50:30.020]  could join together at the hip that's the problem well let me ask you this when you were in
[50:30.580 --> 50:34.340]  before we got out a year ago were you ever part of these drills because i've been to them that
[50:34.340 --> 50:38.500]  are public were they trained to fight guys that literally have beards and wear john dear hats
[50:38.500 --> 50:42.660]  basically they trained to fight hank williams jr were you ever part of that if you ever hear
[50:42.660 --> 50:49.780]  about any of those drills i was never part of those drills but we did have a company come in from
[50:51.860 --> 50:58.500]  they're doing a video for west point and they actually asked some of us to go and work with
[50:58.500 --> 51:05.860]  this film crew and stuff because we have we have a large uh national guard base about 10 minutes
[51:05.860 --> 51:12.500]  from my house where my unit used to be at um and we had this little training town that was out there
[51:12.500 --> 51:19.140]  in the middle of the woods and we'd go out there and they'd make videos of us kicking out doors
[51:19.140 --> 51:24.980]  and all sorts of other stuff for training videos but i was never part of an actual drill exactly
[51:25.940 --> 51:31.060]  and west point is now publicly training but the main enemy is the tea party that's in forbs
[51:31.060 --> 51:36.340]  associated press you name it but the ap reports it like it's a good thing thank god the pentagon's
[51:36.340 --> 51:40.820]  going to smash people that don't want to turn their guns in and and and have the state run their
[51:40.820 --> 51:48.660]  kids go ahead well when i was in you know i always told all my guys that were in my platoon or in my
[51:48.660 --> 51:54.980]  company or anybody that was slow and listed you know remember your oath and even now since i'm out
[51:55.620 --> 52:02.260]  in the i r r right now even though i'm out i still talk to like military officers i still talk to my
[52:02.260 --> 52:07.780]  old soldiers i you know i used to serve with i still tell them remember your oath i mean
[52:07.780 --> 52:12.020]  i mean we all sworn oath to protect the defense of the constitution united states against all
[52:12.020 --> 52:17.540]  enemies fort and domestic so we all have to live by that oath i live by mine every day last year
[52:17.540 --> 52:22.820]  since the sandy oak shooting and i'll i looked into all that and found out it was mostly hoax
[52:23.540 --> 52:29.620]  that was perpetrated by our government i've been looking into you know and researching everything
[52:29.620 --> 52:35.300]  that goes on now i've been calling my congressman every week every two weeks to make sure they get
[52:35.300 --> 52:39.380]  the point across hey you ain't getting exactly everybody's just got to continue to speak to
[52:39.380 --> 52:44.180]  friends and family we're the majority we're the americana culture the culture of america
[52:44.180 --> 52:48.820]  hadn't perfect but it's a billion times better than the globalist synthetic slave culture god bless
[52:48.820 --> 52:53.620]  you and ladies and gentlemen you know sigh hearst the Pulitzer prize-winning two-time investigative
[52:53.620 --> 52:58.980]  journalist he came out last year and concurred with us and said the bin laden raid was 100
[52:58.980 --> 53:04.500]  percent fake i talked to an active duty navy seal that's friends of the family i'll leave it at that
[53:05.300 --> 53:11.220]  weeks after it happened i've had family of people that died in the helicopter that was blown up
[53:11.220 --> 53:16.980]  on saying they know it was set up to kill their family and they were killing that the navy stills
[53:16.980 --> 53:20.740]  were sent in on a bin laden body double we even know the guy's name
[53:20.740 --> 53:31.140]  and now today they've come out and it turns out the pentagon claim they had photos of it and video
[53:31.140 --> 53:36.740]  and all this stuff and then quote when they were ordered to declassify it it was quote all destroyed
[53:36.740 --> 53:41.460]  it was fake they court marshaled hundreds of people on the ship the aircraft carrier now it
[53:41.460 --> 53:46.180]  turns out there was no body dumped overboard that's come out mainstream news it's all lies folks
[53:46.180 --> 53:52.500]  he died a kidney failure a long time ago he was a high-level globalist asset above cia
[53:53.860 --> 53:57.940]  it's all fake and yes we don't know exactly what happened with sandy hook but we got a
[53:57.940 --> 54:02.500]  good idea they bulldozed it they've covered it up real kids were killed there but they did have
[54:02.500 --> 54:07.220]  confirmed actors putting out the official story and bloomberg got caught in internal memos that
[54:07.220 --> 54:12.260]  have been leaked preparing the day before for the big push and saying prepare now for the news splits
[54:12.260 --> 54:17.540]  that's that look it up folks i mean it is incredible and they just count everybody's
[54:17.540 --> 54:22.660]  ignorance to not understand this is real i mean this is so horrible i wish this wasn't true you
[54:22.660 --> 54:26.900]  know it's like when i got the word my uncle was basically brain dead and was going to be turned
[54:26.900 --> 54:31.620]  off and die and i was going to get out there but he died really quick after they took him off they
[54:31.620 --> 54:38.420]  thought he'd fight a few days it's like i've now accepted he's dead and he's gone and we have to
[54:38.420 --> 54:44.580]  accept america is pretty much dead but it's like a spirit it's not a person it could be resurrected
[54:44.580 --> 54:50.100]  in our hearts and minds if we want not the perfect america the medias push but but the real america
[54:50.100 --> 54:55.620]  that at least has basic freedom compared to other nations we're in deep trouble folks this is real
[54:55.620 --> 55:00.020]  and i'm having to come to grips with man it's really as bad as we thought and worse
[55:01.940 --> 55:05.460]  with a bunch of scum that want to have got a score to settle with people that love freedom
[55:05.460 --> 55:12.420]  let's go to glenn in kentucky who's police than reyman is military and a rabbit who's military

[55:40.180 --> 55:46.020]  the constitutionality of the raid program thanks folks think there is a god given right to drive a
[55:46.020 --> 55:51.700]  car on the roads without being bothered by the police that's the furthest thing from the truth
[55:51.700 --> 55:57.140]  bottom line driving is a privilege and not a right under state law now can a police officer stop
[55:57.140 --> 56:03.140]  someone in a traffic stop for no reason no checkpoints have been ruled constitutionally legal
[56:03.140 --> 56:08.420]  as long as the encounter is quick and to the point can i see your license and registration
[56:08.420 --> 56:14.100]  of no parent violations send them on their way being a commonwealth but then they release the
[56:14.100 --> 56:18.500]  legals when they find them no i've seen those quotes in the news now they're looking for people
[56:18.500 --> 56:23.060]  with food in the car or who look like they might have been eating and then they pull you over and

[57:10.500 --> 57:15.140]  acting like they don't know why the collapse is coming the globalist engineered all this that's
[57:15.140 --> 57:22.660]  the point see that's why they stage the crisis is because they can pose as the savior well i i i
[57:22.660 --> 57:29.380]  know that i you woke me up for a few years ago and i've woken up a few members of my family

[01:00:12.420 --> 01:00:21.380]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:28.420]  i haven't even gotten to all the top stories on info wars dot com yet and i'll do that some
[01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:33.700]  with david ike covering the waterfront coming up here but every week we get more local news
[01:00:33.700 --> 01:00:38.500]  reports just where it leaks out where the military is training with police to take on gun owners
[01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:43.940]  veterans and building them as terrorists in the drills where they shoot blow-up schools release
[01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:49.940]  bio weapons because quote they're mad about the second amendment being repealed and they're
[01:00:49.940 --> 01:00:54.660]  going to be a lot of people i'll imagine it's going to be about five percent at first that
[01:00:54.660 --> 01:00:59.860]  refuse to turn their guns in openly most people just quietly won't do it i'd say half then they're
[01:00:59.860 --> 01:01:03.860]  going to start persecuting gun owners as they're already doing and then a civil war is going to
[01:01:03.860 --> 01:01:08.260]  break out and that's what the globalists have already scripted and prepared like a pr rollout
[01:01:08.260 --> 01:01:15.540]  and i mean no one should want to be part of this this is horrible but they've got to do this to
[01:01:15.540 --> 01:01:21.620]  cover up the economic collapse they've engineered so they don't get in trouble this is a plan folks
[01:01:21.620 --> 01:01:29.940]  and we're just getting so close to it garret in austin uh military to give us your take on this
[01:01:29.940 --> 01:01:34.020]  so what's your take on it wow alex great to talk to you've been trying to get all the
[01:01:34.020 --> 01:01:39.620]  view for some time uh first off a little background information on me i uh served in security forces
[01:01:39.620 --> 01:01:47.140]  guarding nuclear assets and uh bremerton washington up in the pacific northwest um one quick note uh
[01:01:47.140 --> 01:01:53.700]  once i got out the base commander there the leading officer of the base got um taken out and fired
[01:01:54.500 --> 01:02:00.500]  for a legit forgery charges i didn't think much of it at the time but now you see this huge purge
[01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:06.900]  in the all the nuclear um programs of all the leading officers over the cross the border kind
[01:02:06.900 --> 01:02:12.180]  of name think about it no this is a military this is a purge of the military by the obama noids
[01:02:12.180 --> 01:02:17.460]  and goldman sacks and jp morgan that run the country well and you know my take on what's
[01:02:17.460 --> 01:02:22.580]  going to happen to be perfectly honest with you um uh it i'm thinking it's going to be a lot like
[01:02:22.580 --> 01:02:27.700]  egypt um if you're anybody who's in the military or has been in the military they see that it works
[01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:33.700]  literally like a communist country if you live on base all the houses are lined up they all look the
[01:02:33.700 --> 01:02:38.500]  same they come check your rooms anytime they want they come make sure you're always doing what you're
[01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:43.300]  supposed to making sure you eat your meals every day um before you go on vacation you have to go
[01:02:43.300 --> 01:02:47.860]  to what's called a safety stand down it's uh you go to the auditorium they have to teach you about
[01:02:47.860 --> 01:02:54.580]  chainsaw safety about boat safety about barbeque safety it's the craziest thing ever and it's
[01:02:54.580 --> 01:02:59.620]  the reason they want the military to take over once the civil war breaks out and which they're
[01:02:59.620 --> 01:03:05.140]  going to do exactly like they've done in egypt and syria and plant different al-qaeda linked groups are
[01:03:05.140 --> 01:03:10.500]  any other terrorist organizations they probably have um uh paid contractors that they'll send in
[01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:16.020]  to work and act as if they're the rebels and do atrocities and then have the military take over
[01:03:16.020 --> 01:03:20.500]  everybody that's in the military has been trained to respect authority brainwashed
[01:03:20.500 --> 01:03:24.500]  and those of them who've gotten out that are veterans that's why they're demonized today
[01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:30.900]  because they're either going to be completely compartmentalized and ruled by that authoritarian
[01:03:30.900 --> 01:03:34.900]  mindset that they've been brainwashed to think or they're going to be completely against it
[01:03:34.900 --> 01:03:40.260]  like me and have their eyes opened out evil it is and be completely willing to fight back
[01:03:40.260 --> 01:03:44.580]  and know how the system works and that's why they're the greatest enemy out there right now
[01:03:44.580 --> 01:03:48.260]  and uh but you know all the people that are in the military they're already trained to
[01:03:48.260 --> 01:03:53.220]  respect the authority to you know they've already been trained i give up my constitutional right
[01:03:53.220 --> 01:03:58.900]  when i sign that paper and because i signed this contract i have nothing i and now the cops are
[01:03:58.900 --> 01:04:02.820]  saying hey you have no right to not be in a checkpoint or have a search your house everything's
[01:04:02.820 --> 01:04:08.100]  a privilege guns are a privilege driving's a privilege yet they they believe it and man i mean
[01:04:08.100 --> 01:04:13.780]  every cartoon i see movies they're demonizing them the the resistance i mean this is it and folks
[01:04:13.780 --> 01:04:18.820]  i'm not here trying to scare you we got a chance to beat these people what they're trying is outrageous
[01:04:18.820 --> 01:04:26.500]  go ahead um i just wanted to quickly add um i i got out of the military because uh i admit that
[01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:30.900]  i was uh a lot of us were smoking what's called spice i'm sure you've heard of it i would never
[01:04:30.900 --> 01:04:35.860]  do it again never you know we were just really depressed we hated our lives there um but there
[01:04:35.860 --> 01:04:41.620]  was a lot of drug activity going on on that base well they came into my room in the middle of the
[01:04:41.620 --> 01:04:46.660]  night took me and confined me in the brig for two months without charging me with well yeah they
[01:04:46.660 --> 01:04:51.780]  also give the troops drugs the prescription to prime the pump that way they get a record on
[01:04:51.780 --> 01:04:57.540]  you in a way to destroy you everything is about institutionalizing us domesticating us breaking

[01:12:15.140 --> 01:12:21.860]  bite my tongue hoping that uh you know the rest of it doesn't turn out to be true i'm just pinching
[01:12:21.860 --> 01:12:27.140]  myself um but david icke joins us one of the most controversial guests you can have on
[01:12:27.140 --> 01:12:30.100]  and we're always honored to have him i've had a chance to hang out with him over the years get to
[01:12:30.100 --> 01:12:34.660]  know him he's a really real guy people ask is david icke for real yes he's for real is he right
[01:12:34.660 --> 01:12:37.220]  about everything i don't think any of us are right about everything because we see through rose
[01:12:37.220 --> 01:12:42.820]  colored glasses you know the distortion of our senses in the spot in the time space continuum
[01:12:42.820 --> 01:12:48.580]  but so much is happening the great awakening is happening that he said 20 years ago he thought
[01:12:48.580 --> 01:12:57.940]  would begin around uh 2014 through 2016 2017 and uh it's evils rising but for every action
[01:12:57.940 --> 01:13:02.900]  is an opposite and equal reaction so much is going on the global collapse is being engineered
[01:13:02.900 --> 01:13:08.420]  as the new world order poses the saviors either all of the news adding deadly chemicals to everything
[01:13:08.420 --> 01:13:13.460]  on purpose to brain damages their own documents are public by the white house science are john
[01:13:13.460 --> 01:13:20.100]  p holdren in his own book eco science uh dna results for the nephilim skulls mainstream news
[01:13:20.100 --> 01:13:25.860]  they've tested those weird peruvian skulls and say it's a new form of humans i mean this is all
[01:13:25.860 --> 01:13:29.940]  just getting insane and more and more is going to happen more and more is going to be revealed
[01:13:30.500 --> 01:13:34.020]  and people are going to get deeper into the matrix and lies and false reality
[01:13:34.020 --> 01:13:39.380]  at the same time as others become more awakened i agree with david ike on that so david give us
[01:13:39.380 --> 01:13:44.260]  the big picture of where you think we are what you think the top stories are right now and what
[01:13:44.260 --> 01:13:48.740]  you think is coming and then we'll cover the waterfront with a whole bunch of uh news david
[01:13:48.740 --> 01:13:53.220]  thanks for coming on with us no problem mate hey it's been a while isn't it build a bird winnet
[01:13:53.220 --> 01:13:59.140]  in in what food the last time uh we met and uh first of all congratulations to big 408
[01:13:59.940 --> 01:14:03.540]  that's right i'm 40 today it's stranger on on my birthday david thanks for coming on
[01:14:03.540 --> 01:14:12.820]  there you go well i'm i'm 62 so you you know you're uh you're a whippersnapper mate i think you know
[01:14:13.940 --> 01:14:19.700]  we are reaching the point now we've reached the point where so many strands of this are coming
[01:14:19.700 --> 01:14:29.540]  together and if you connect the dots between the strands it's challenging us to open our minds
[01:14:29.540 --> 01:14:36.260]  to things that we would have dismissed by reflex action not so long ago i've been saying for um
[01:14:37.540 --> 01:14:45.860]  for two decades that the rabbit hole is so deep that if we're only looking at things like
[01:14:45.860 --> 01:14:52.980]  banking scams and engineered wars and engineered uh terrorist attacks etc which is very very important
[01:14:52.980 --> 01:15:00.260]  uh to expose but but we're still walking around the edge of the rabbit hole this is so deep and
[01:15:01.300 --> 01:15:08.020]  we have to i would suggest open our minds to the fact that there are forces at work in the unseen
[01:15:09.220 --> 01:15:14.820]  which christians call demons which islamic believers called jinn which other people call
[01:15:14.820 --> 01:15:20.900]  archons other people call flyers in central america the shaman there is an unseen force
[01:15:20.900 --> 01:15:32.500]  manipulating this and the idea is to put humans into such a low state of consciousness and awareness
[01:15:33.940 --> 01:15:42.100]  that the manipulating force becomes the um one eyed man in the land of the so they basically
[01:15:42.100 --> 01:15:46.420]  want us to be robots david i love seeing your huge newsroom back there but unfortunately your
[01:15:46.420 --> 01:15:50.260]  omni directional mic is picking up everything they're saying i want to hear what you have to say
[01:15:50.260 --> 01:15:55.380]  can somebody shut that door i'll do that thanks a lot brother all right good i do i do like the
[01:15:55.380 --> 01:16:00.980]  shot though but uh it seemed when we went on air the noise volume went up so uh yeah it looks like
[01:16:00.980 --> 01:16:05.940]  you got a ant hill of liberty lovers in there running around getting stuff done please continue
[01:16:05.940 --> 01:16:12.340]  david so so they want to turn us into robots basically and they want to um they want to put
[01:16:12.340 --> 01:16:20.580]  us in a smaller um perception a bubble than the manipulating force is in like i say in the land
[01:16:20.580 --> 01:16:28.100]  of the blind the one eyed man is king and and you know in terms of things going on now fundamental
[01:16:28.100 --> 01:16:38.820]  to pushing that further on is transhumanism the idea is to sell us the belief that we can be enhanced
[01:16:38.820 --> 01:16:46.100]  by technological additions to the body and this alex we talked about this over the years this is um
[01:16:46.900 --> 01:16:53.140]  this is bringing to light what i've said about the human body all these years that is a biological
[01:16:53.140 --> 01:17:02.100]  computer um and because it's a biological computer it can be connected and can interact with other
[01:17:02.100 --> 01:17:10.580]  forms of computer software i i technological computers you see what you've got um there was a
[01:17:10.580 --> 01:17:21.380]  story um this week in britain about the invention of a um an artificial hand which for the first time
[01:17:21.380 --> 01:17:28.100]  gave the person the ability to feel things to feel texture to feel the softness of something
[01:17:28.100 --> 01:17:32.180]  that that had never been done before they could they could move it and pick things up before but
[01:17:32.180 --> 01:17:39.460]  they could never feel things and it's a real simple process in in in theme there are electrical
[01:17:39.460 --> 01:17:45.380]  signals passing around the brain and there are electrical signals that pass around the the
[01:17:45.380 --> 01:17:51.780]  technology it's electrochemical and the brain has no firewall basically what they're doing is making
[01:17:51.780 --> 01:17:59.700]  those two forms of energetic information talk to each other and that so so the hand talks to the
[01:17:59.700 --> 01:18:07.540]  brain that way and therefore the brain can decode the feeling of texture and touch so what we're
[01:18:07.540 --> 01:18:16.820]  looking at then with transhumanism is putting in various technological bits of kit and stuff
[01:18:16.820 --> 01:18:23.380]  and connected it to the uh the human body the biological computer and it's being sold like
[01:18:23.380 --> 01:18:30.660]  a say is a great step forward to be on human amazing things that humans can do that's that's
[01:18:30.660 --> 01:18:38.420]  the sell because whenever you are selling something whatever it is the mobile phone technology connected
[01:18:38.420 --> 01:18:43.940]  to the smart media technology connected to the smart television technology whenever you are
[01:18:43.940 --> 01:18:49.940]  selling something that's real bad for the target population you have to sell it as a benefit
[01:18:49.940 --> 01:18:54.020]  otherwise people are coming out having that you've got to sell oh virgin Atlantic has google
[01:18:54.020 --> 01:19:01.220]  glasses oh my refrigerator talks to my smart meter oh oh it's all so wonderful this is the
[01:19:01.220 --> 01:19:08.660]  this is the thing and so what's um the real agenda is is not enhancing human beings they
[01:19:08.660 --> 01:19:13.860]  don't want greater potential for human beings they want to suppress human beings it's to create
[01:19:13.860 --> 01:19:18.980]  a situation where the technology is talking to the brain and telling the brain what to
[01:19:18.980 --> 01:19:23.540]  think and what and they sell it as enhancement it's not the technology itself would be bad
[01:19:23.540 --> 01:19:28.020]  it's that the people running it deploying it rolling it out have made a detrojan horse
[01:19:28.020 --> 01:19:33.620]  openly to dehumanize us yeah that's why you know my new books called the perception deception
[01:19:33.620 --> 01:19:38.420]  because that's what it all is you know we can talk about conspiracies involving banking and
[01:19:38.420 --> 01:19:43.540]  and all these other things that we talk about quite rightly but you take this whole conspiracy
[01:19:43.540 --> 01:19:48.500]  Alex down to its base it is the matrix stay there i want to come back and talk about the book
[01:19:48.500 --> 01:19:53.300]  and and and what's at the bottom of the rabbit hole here with this whole perception deception
[01:19:53.300 --> 01:20:15.940]  and that's it they're trying to insert us into a false system we'll be right back

[01:24:30.180 --> 01:24:34.420]  technocrats i've been calling them that for at least 18 years reading their own deep literature
[01:24:34.420 --> 01:24:39.380]  now they're public about it and david icke always talked about the emergence point when the agenda
[01:24:39.380 --> 01:24:45.220]  gets too big and too open to deny they go oh it is real and if you don't like it you're a terrorist
[01:24:45.220 --> 01:24:49.140]  there is a world government there is global taxes we are going to put chips in your brain

[01:24:57.860 --> 01:25:03.620]  damaging them it's it's lowering iq language is shrinking parents unaware of dangers faced by
[01:25:03.620 --> 01:25:10.980]  children on smartphones bbc this is the reality ladies and gentlemen and the drugging of the
[01:25:10.980 --> 01:25:18.020]  public and the chemicals it's an undoubted aggressive evil criminal agenda and david icke
[01:25:18.020 --> 01:25:22.100]  joins us he was getting to the key point there and he's been talking about this 20 years folks
[01:25:22.100 --> 01:25:28.500]  saying they wanted to hack the brain create a false neural system take over now uh people say well
[01:25:28.500 --> 01:25:32.820]  he says it's entities in another dimension doing this that sounds crazy what does every culture
[01:25:32.820 --> 01:25:37.380]  say regardless of whether those entities are real or not or that's some archetypal manifestation
[01:25:37.380 --> 01:25:42.100]  through people i've been to bohemian grove i've covered skull and bones i know elitist i grew up
[01:25:42.100 --> 01:25:46.580]  in the richest county in texas where all the rich people were basically devil worshipers
[01:25:46.580 --> 01:25:51.300]  we had to leave the town because of it okay i mean it was unbelievable the stuff they tried
[01:25:51.300 --> 01:25:55.700]  to induct me into i've seen stuff at the time i was 14 that most people never even imagined
[01:25:56.660 --> 01:26:00.740]  and i can see it was all part of my life part of a journey to know this stuff's real
[01:26:00.740 --> 01:26:04.900]  the police stealing drugs you name it this is sort segment long segment coming up i'm ranting
[01:26:04.900 --> 01:26:11.300]  david it's just that regardless the elites do believe they're getting power from these entities
[01:26:11.300 --> 01:26:19.220]  go ahead well they are i mean you know they're sick and in terms of wisdom they are without
[01:26:19.220 --> 01:26:25.700]  wisdom because cleverness and wisdom are not the same thing uh cleverness is a very much lower
[01:26:25.700 --> 01:26:35.780]  level of of ability of intelligence but they're not in that cleverness area they're not stupid
[01:26:35.780 --> 01:26:41.220]  in that sense so they're not going to be uh all these centuries and right to the present day
[01:26:41.780 --> 01:26:48.100]  they're not going to be worshiping some something that is not there but the whole point of which
[01:26:48.100 --> 01:26:56.500]  pulls all the strands together is the perception deception because that is the crucial foundation
[01:26:56.500 --> 01:27:03.780]  if you've got a target population of billions and you are compared with that a tiny cabal
[01:27:05.620 --> 01:27:12.100]  and the the core of it hidden in the shadows then you can't control that population
[01:27:12.100 --> 01:27:20.500]  um physically in total uh you can start to get there the more that you bring the population
[01:27:20.500 --> 01:27:26.580]  under mental control through drugs and various other means like the um transhumanist technology
[01:27:26.580 --> 01:27:33.060]  will will come to um but we're not quite there yet we're not there yet so they still have um
[01:27:33.060 --> 01:27:40.740]  a situation where they have to control a target population and the way the only way you can do
[01:27:40.740 --> 01:27:48.820]  it is by manipulating their perception of self of the world of world events of authority
[01:27:50.100 --> 01:27:56.740]  so that that perception will suit your agenda for global control and from perception comes what
[01:27:56.740 --> 01:28:06.340]  behavior and response or in this world we live in lack of response to what is going on so you look
[01:28:06.340 --> 01:28:13.860]  at the education system alex from this perspective and it's a it's a crucial part of the perception
[01:28:13.860 --> 01:28:21.460]  deception because you know you've got children increasingly from the earliest ages i mean you
[01:28:21.460 --> 01:28:28.980]  come out of the womb alex um and within what three years now suddenly you're you're you're in a school
[01:28:28.980 --> 01:28:34.500]  which are nothing more than prisons now um and you're having an authority figure telling you
[01:28:34.500 --> 01:28:38.740]  what's right what's wrong what's possible and impossible what you can do what you can't do
[01:28:38.740 --> 01:28:44.740]  when you can go when you can't go and more and more power is being given to school authorities
[01:28:44.740 --> 01:28:52.420]  um and and taken away from parents and that's a massive perception deception element because
[01:28:53.220 --> 01:28:59.860]  you then have control at least five days a week of that child and young person and students
[01:28:59.860 --> 01:29:08.500]  um information that they receive basically and what you're doing through a rigged curriculum
[01:29:09.060 --> 01:29:15.860]  with with rigged versions of everything is that you are programming them to see themselves
[01:29:15.860 --> 01:29:23.540]  in the world and authority in the way that suits you all this stuff now with um the cameras with
[01:29:23.540 --> 01:29:29.140]  the technology to get your dinner you have to give a fingerprint technology all these things

[01:36:24.500 --> 01:36:28.260]  going to give you the floor or i'm going to keep jumping in here david ike you were getting into
[01:36:28.260 --> 01:36:34.420]  the suppression of human consciousness the fact is they want to look iqs are going down from the
[01:36:34.420 --> 01:36:39.380]  florida harvard study we know they want to suppress us they teach common core you were talking about
[01:36:39.380 --> 01:36:45.300]  the state all over the world saying your kids belong to us 2 plus 2 equals 5 they literally
[01:36:45.300 --> 01:36:52.100]  are like o'brien in 1984 in the united states with common core 2 plus 2 equals 5 a huge crime
[01:36:52.100 --> 01:36:58.660]  against the children screwing up their brains what is at the bottom of the rabbit hole well
[01:36:59.460 --> 01:37:05.380]  like i was saying before the break the education system is crucial to the perception deception
[01:37:05.380 --> 01:37:14.980]  because you have young minds who can be molded day after day after day after day and one of the
[01:37:14.980 --> 01:37:20.900]  great testaments to human consciousness in its greater form is the number of young people who've
[01:37:20.900 --> 01:37:26.740]  been through that system so many have and it's it's it's caught them but there's so many young
[01:37:26.740 --> 01:37:32.740]  people that have been through that system and have still seen the truth of what's going on so that
[01:37:32.740 --> 01:37:39.620]  that's incredibly encouraging so you've got education well what passes for it i mean gandy
[01:37:39.620 --> 01:37:44.740]  once said or was asked what he thought of western civilization and he said i think it would be a very
[01:37:44.740 --> 01:37:49.940]  good idea and i think education would be a very good idea that's not what we've got it's a programming
[01:37:49.940 --> 01:37:58.180]  operation to turn young minds into little more than software programs that respond in the desired way
[01:37:58.180 --> 01:38:06.660]  to inputting data i.e. situations that they face but then going alongside that the education system
[01:38:06.660 --> 01:38:11.620]  parallel with it of course is the mainstream media which you and i have been challenging
[01:38:11.620 --> 01:38:20.500]  for a long time and the mainstream media is constantly supporting the version of self the
[01:38:20.500 --> 01:38:27.140]  version of reality the version of the world that education is pumping out so now there are if you
[01:38:27.140 --> 01:38:34.500]  like stereo versions of this programming which young people are receiving and indeed people in
[01:38:34.500 --> 01:38:40.180]  general in terms of the media are receiving all the time and that is constantly telling them
[01:38:40.180 --> 01:38:47.700]  them a version of events which simply isn't true but if people buy it their responses and their
[01:38:47.700 --> 01:38:55.620]  behavior will walk straight into the hands of the agenda for global control so the media is doing that
[01:38:56.740 --> 01:39:04.980]  then you have and you've mentioned one or two things then you have the toxic assault on the human
[01:39:04.980 --> 01:39:12.580]  brain and the human genetic structure most notably through genetically modified food which is there
[01:39:12.580 --> 01:39:21.540]  simply to genetically modify us then you you have things like growth hormones which are given to
[01:39:21.540 --> 01:39:29.700]  cattle which then cross over to humans and so you have this big epidemic for that and other reasons
[01:39:29.700 --> 01:39:37.860]  of obesity which which again is taking people into a world that their bodies weren't meant to
[01:39:37.860 --> 01:39:43.700]  go into i mean just look back a few decades and see what it was like before and then you've got the
[01:39:44.980 --> 01:39:51.860]  the aspartame then you've got the fluoride in the water which are both brain suppressants and
[01:39:51.860 --> 01:40:00.580]  brain rewires and you put all this together plus pharmaceutical drugs plus the vaccines that are
[01:40:01.380 --> 01:40:09.140]  not only deluging the human immune system in young children before it's even formed
[01:40:09.140 --> 01:40:18.660]  it's also affecting people mentally and emotionally that toxic cocktail that we call vaccines so you
[01:40:18.660 --> 01:40:26.980]  put all this together and there's absolutely a war from multiple levels on human perception and
[01:40:26.980 --> 01:40:35.220]  there's another one and that is you know in the last 50 years the radiation in our atmosphere
[01:40:35.220 --> 01:40:44.580]  at the level that we play out our lives has increased by millions of times so open-minded
[01:40:44.580 --> 01:40:53.780]  scientists have called it an experiment on on human life without knowing the outcome but the
[01:40:53.780 --> 01:41:00.180]  people in the in the core in the shadows from which it is coming they do know the outcome
[01:41:00.180 --> 01:41:06.420]  and part of that outcome is to and this is where we come into transhumanism this is where we come
[01:41:06.420 --> 01:41:12.260]  into the the internet to a large extent plus additions to the internet that are planned and
[01:41:12.260 --> 01:41:18.980]  indeed are now being talked about i get to one of them in a second because the human brainwave
[01:41:19.700 --> 01:41:28.340]  activity operates at a certain frequencies frequency band if you can access that frequency
[01:41:28.340 --> 01:41:36.100]  band with information delivered electromagnetically and electrically then you are putting thoughts
[01:41:36.100 --> 01:41:46.420]  and perceptions and beliefs perceptions of reality into that system and the person is having thoughts
[01:41:46.420 --> 01:41:52.340]  and feelings and coming to conclusions that they think they're their own conclusions but they're
[01:41:52.340 --> 01:42:00.900]  not and anything that's got smart in front of it is part of that grid smart televisions which
[01:42:00.900 --> 01:42:10.500]  can look at you smart phones as smart meters smart grids this is all part of it and the idea is i've
[01:42:10.500 --> 01:42:17.380]  been writing about this for years smart growth smart growth smart cities smart everything smart
[01:42:17.380 --> 01:42:24.580]  smart cars they're called intelligent highways yeah so what's um and of course the word smart
[01:42:24.580 --> 01:42:29.380]  is to is to give the underlying subconscious as well as conscious impression that this is the
[01:42:29.380 --> 01:42:34.260]  smart thing to do this is the intelligent way to do it there are benefits in this for you
[01:42:34.260 --> 01:42:39.940]  and there are not benefits for you there is just control and suppression of your perception of
[01:42:39.940 --> 01:42:46.020]  reality and perception of the world so you've got this and for me i've been writing about this for
[01:42:46.020 --> 01:42:55.300]  years um you know the internet has fantastic benefits for getting this information out i mean
[01:42:55.300 --> 01:43:00.420]  you me and people like us would never have got the information out that we have uh to the number
[01:43:00.420 --> 01:43:07.060]  of people we have without the internet but again if you're going to sell a prison then you've got
[01:43:07.060 --> 01:43:12.020]  to sell it as a beneficial thing and up to this point it has been but as you know and people
[01:43:12.020 --> 01:43:18.020]  following the story know the idea is and it's already unfolding uh in many many different facets
[01:43:18.020 --> 01:43:24.580]  and faces it's to take away the things that are beneficial uh for the internet for people the
[01:43:24.580 --> 01:43:28.900]  free flow of information that's right they let it be free for a while like a highway paid for
[01:43:28.900 --> 01:43:33.620]  by everybody's tax money then they hand it over to a toll road company they're already starting
[01:43:33.620 --> 01:43:39.460]  with unified agenda worldwide to phase out the freedom exactly and so what's left when they do
[01:43:39.460 --> 01:43:46.180]  that if we allow it is the beneficial part of the internet for them and that is as a massive
[01:43:46.740 --> 01:43:53.940]  mind programming perception programming operation spy grid because um for me i mean i guess i've
[01:43:53.940 --> 01:44:03.220]  been saying this for years what the internet is designed to be is a an electronic collective mind
[01:44:03.220 --> 01:44:09.220]  for humanity and this is where the transhumanism comes in because the idea of putting chips into
[01:44:09.220 --> 01:44:16.980]  people and other pieces of kit that connect us to the internet um and of course google the forefront
[01:44:16.980 --> 01:44:24.420]  of all this stuff google's just enough just just the the smiling face of darpa at that level um the uh
[01:44:24.420 --> 01:44:29.140]  technological development arm of the pentagon that's why you have people like regime the dougan
[01:44:29.140 --> 01:44:33.780]  director of darpa moving to become an executive of google it's it's not brain science why that
[01:44:33.780 --> 01:44:40.100]  happened they're expressions of each other and and so the idea is to connect us to the internet
[01:44:40.100 --> 01:44:45.780]  technologically so the internet becomes our collective and let me throw this in their own
[01:44:45.780 --> 01:44:51.380]  record poisoning the environment and wrecking our genetics so that we've got to merge with the machines
[01:44:51.380 --> 01:44:56.900]  and the new medical systems just to survive the total form of true enslavement and then they're
[01:44:56.900 --> 01:45:03.060]  there posing as the saviors when they've created the problem somebody's got to do something about it
[01:45:03.060 --> 01:45:07.780]  and then they're there to give the solution problem reaction solution i this was in the
[01:45:07.780 --> 01:45:14.260]  british press this week um alex um headline forget the internet soon there will be the
[01:45:14.260 --> 01:45:20.420]  alternate company plans to beam free wi-fi to every person on earth from space was in the
[01:45:20.420 --> 01:45:26.740]  london daily mail they're quoting an organization called media development investment fund in the
[01:45:26.740 --> 01:45:33.620]  united states which is among its funders um are at the open society foundations of george sorris
[01:45:33.620 --> 01:45:39.780]  you know that man aww he likes us and what they what they're saying is they want to beam it
[01:45:39.780 --> 01:45:45.700]  from space because they care about freedom of expression you see so they want to get over the
[01:45:46.420 --> 01:45:52.500]  the restrictions in china and and all this they're such nice people um and and and give us um
[01:45:53.140 --> 01:45:59.300]  internet want to beam into russia overthrow that exactly yeah now what this is i would suggest
[01:45:59.300 --> 01:46:05.220]  and there'll be other things too is another layer on because the when i talk about the internet
[01:46:05.220 --> 01:46:11.940]  what i what i'm also talking about is the lower levels of the earth's atmosphere where we interact
[01:46:11.940 --> 01:46:21.300]  and live our lives they want to fill that with so much electromagnetic information um broadcasting
[01:46:21.300 --> 01:46:29.380]  within the human brainwave and genetic frequency but we are bombarded with uh basically a frequency
[01:46:29.380 --> 01:46:38.020]  pollution a jamming signal 24 7 um programming system this is what smart meters are about what are
[01:46:38.020 --> 01:46:44.740]  they doing they're creating a wi-fi radiation field yet another one that's very kind very sensible
[01:46:44.740 --> 01:46:50.580]  thank you within every home and business that's the idea with the smart grids and and you know
[01:46:50.580 --> 01:46:57.540]  people have said and rightly too um that what they're doing um is being able to see when you open
[01:46:57.540 --> 01:47:04.100]  your fridge how many people's in your house what room they're in what exactly yes but you know as
[01:47:04.100 --> 01:47:09.940]  they say on a motorbike the throttle goes both ways well so does so does wi-fi you can you can
[01:47:09.940 --> 01:47:15.540]  you can get information from a from a location and you can pick up that no no that's on record
[01:47:15.540 --> 01:47:20.260]  let me expand on this when i go to big bend where i'd love to go live but it's the middle of nowhere
[01:47:20.260 --> 01:47:26.180]  you know down in in south uh west texas on the mexican border and there's nothing on that side
[01:47:26.180 --> 01:47:31.940]  of mexico either your cell phones don't work literally even though i'm at 9 000 feet or whatever
[01:47:31.940 --> 01:47:37.540]  i feel 20 years younger it's like heaven because there's no wi-fi but now it's not going to matter
[01:47:37.540 --> 01:47:43.460]  they're launching blimps and satellites that are going to blast everything and there's all these people
[01:47:43.460 --> 01:47:48.660]  moving to the countryside's in europe and worldwide as you know to get away from frequency pollution
[01:47:48.660 --> 01:47:53.860]  sorry you're not going to get away from it go ahead yeah well this is this is what i point
[01:47:53.860 --> 01:47:58.180]  i'll come to in a second um about trying to run away you're not trying to run away we've got to
[01:47:58.180 --> 01:48:01.860]  run straight up these people because he's trying to run away you'll run away for a while and then
[01:48:01.860 --> 01:48:07.300]  it'll catch you up i mean we've got to deal with it for goodness sake don't run away from it um and so
[01:48:07.300 --> 01:48:15.060]  what is um uh happening is that uh with the smart meters that's uh another electromagnetic field
[01:48:15.060 --> 01:48:19.540]  which is not only taking information from your home and business and delivering that to a central
[01:48:19.540 --> 01:48:26.100]  point information's coming the other way within the the frequency of human brainwave activity so
[01:48:26.100 --> 01:48:31.220]  it can feed you impressions it can feed you perceptions it can feed you thoughts and and
[01:48:31.220 --> 01:48:38.340]  beliefs that's the idea and what hollywood is doing i mean what we're talking about a perception
[01:48:38.340 --> 01:48:44.100]  deception hollywood my goodness it's one of the great vehicles for it you know i've been 50 old
[01:48:44.100 --> 01:48:47.700]  countries everywhere you go that's where i wanted to go next though i want to stop you right there
[01:48:47.700 --> 01:48:53.380]  it's only got like 15 minutes or five minutes the next hour with you max uh david icke.com joining
[01:48:53.380 --> 01:48:58.580]  us right now again i'm alec shones if you just tuned in david you know a lot of famous people i
[01:48:58.580 --> 01:49:04.340]  know a lot of famous people most of them do not have the courage to go public uh i mean most big
[01:49:04.340 --> 01:49:10.900]  hollywood stars a list most big producers i know 95 of them won't come on air but a lot of them have
[01:49:10.900 --> 01:49:15.460]  come on air and in hollywood it's not liberal or conservative they're listening to you they're
[01:49:15.460 --> 01:49:21.540]  listening to me they're all awake they hate the old shadowy producers some are redstone and others
[01:49:21.540 --> 01:49:26.740]  that won't let them tell the truth there's a revolution going on in hollywood and i see it
[01:49:26.740 --> 01:49:31.460]  the new lego movie and the new nut job movie anti-establishment how they want to program us
[01:49:31.460 --> 01:49:37.220]  and that's not propaganda there's a war going on even in hollywood i mean take alice walker
[01:49:37.220 --> 01:49:42.020]  of the color purple and all her big topics who's a listener of you a listener of me
[01:49:42.020 --> 01:49:46.580]  she promotes this gets attacked my point is is that we're going to skip this network break
[01:49:46.580 --> 01:49:51.300]  folks we're going to skip another break this is so important david i i'm saying we are on the
[01:49:51.300 --> 01:49:59.460]  edge of winning because this isn't fake almost everyone in hollywood i've now learned is a listener
[01:49:59.460 --> 01:50:04.740]  of this show and they talk about you as well and i'm on a power trip over that this is the main
[01:50:04.740 --> 01:50:11.140]  enemy brainwashing base and we by the grace of the creator and in human consciousness and everything
[01:50:11.140 --> 01:50:16.820]  and our listeners we've not infiltrated them they are in the programming system they know the truth
[01:50:16.820 --> 01:50:21.780]  better than us they're absolutely freaking out the military's waking up because they're
[01:50:21.780 --> 01:50:26.660]  decompartmentalized with our information this is incredible so what do you want to say about that
[01:50:26.660 --> 01:50:33.700]  because i want to be clear hollywood is on the verge of a of a huge awakening and and and and
[01:50:33.700 --> 01:50:41.860]  a revolution against the old guys that control it david i well take hollywood take any aspect of
[01:50:41.860 --> 01:50:49.540]  this global spiders web and hollywood will fit the blueprint you've got a very few people that
[01:50:49.540 --> 01:50:56.500]  call the shots and you've got everyone else that dance to the shots that are called what has happened
[01:50:56.500 --> 01:51:05.220]  um thanks to the internet up to this point and books and many other you know vehicles um is that
[01:51:06.500 --> 01:51:14.580]  yes the compartmentalized structure as is being decompartmentalized because before there was no
[01:51:14.580 --> 01:51:20.980]  way that those in the compartmentalized structure could get access to information that only those
[01:51:20.980 --> 01:51:25.540]  they knew so they were always in the dark they were always a piece in a puzzle they didn't
[01:51:25.540 --> 01:51:29.620]  understand they didn't realize there was a puzzle they just knew that little piece and they thought
[01:51:29.620 --> 01:51:34.340]  that was it what has happened because this information is circulated and circulated and
[01:51:34.340 --> 01:51:40.340]  circulated and my goodness me the number of people that are interested in now is phenomenal compared
[01:51:40.340 --> 01:51:45.940]  with just a few years ago even that those compartments are breaking down because people lower down
[01:51:45.940 --> 01:51:50.900]  in the structure are going old on a second when they hear this information that makes sense of
[01:51:50.900 --> 01:51:55.780]  what i'm doing every day that makes sense of why i did that i was asked to do this movie and do this
[01:51:55.780 --> 01:52:03.940]  scene and read the script but i what i would say alex you know is yes people are waking up but
[01:52:03.940 --> 01:52:10.100]  you know we can't just hold it at a point where we're waking up while still standing on the other
[01:52:10.100 --> 01:52:15.940]  side of the street knowing more about what's happening and watching it with more understanding
[01:52:15.940 --> 01:52:20.020]  of the the the unfolding that's kind of like being conscious while you're being roasted it's
[01:52:20.020 --> 01:52:26.580]  almost worse if you don't reverse it we've got across the street and engage this right and and
[01:52:26.580 --> 01:52:34.740]  there has to be a revolution of the many to refuse to acquiesce to the imposition of the few
[01:52:35.380 --> 01:52:41.460]  and because i mean those people i'll say to those people in hollywood but that are well
[01:52:41.460 --> 01:52:46.900]  often have lots and lots of money um but are not part of this whole thing they may be caught in it
[01:52:46.900 --> 01:52:51.700]  but they're not part of it i would say this to people in america and around the world or at the
[01:52:51.700 --> 01:52:57.860]  moment think that they're okay and they're well often or comfortable and it don't really affect
[01:52:57.860 --> 01:53:05.780]  them well hold on there are people now in ten cities in in america and homeless in the streets
[01:53:05.780 --> 01:53:11.700]  in places like britain who not long ago considered themselves to be middle class and had a nice house
[01:53:11.700 --> 01:53:18.180]  and a big mortgage at which they could at that time pay it turns very quickly because the the
[01:53:18.180 --> 01:53:24.420]  where we're heading um is what i call the home of games society and it's real simple and my goodness
[01:53:24.420 --> 01:53:34.340]  me can you not see it now it's for less than one percent to control all wealth land water food
[01:53:34.340 --> 01:53:42.980]  production all of it to have then a strata of uniformed programs software programs called
[01:53:42.980 --> 01:53:50.820]  the police state with it with no ability to um process information just to respond to orders
[01:53:51.780 --> 01:53:57.940]  psychopath sociopaths narcissists we're seeing them being recruited on a personality basis rather
[01:53:57.940 --> 01:54:06.500]  than an ability basis all the time and under that is supposed to be this plan to be everyone else in
[01:54:06.500 --> 01:54:16.340]  a uh a slave um masses with a major major massive culling as well um which are subordinate and those
[01:54:16.340 --> 01:54:23.940]  slaves will be subject to um microchips and other forms of forced inoculations it's already
[01:54:23.940 --> 01:54:30.020]  happening uh 200 square foot coffin apartments this is the point alex when you realize and you
[01:54:30.020 --> 01:54:35.140]  know what's happening and you know where it's going you read the world like an open book this
[01:54:35.140 --> 01:54:41.140]  stuff now you see these things where you you swallow pills and have an edible um microchip
[01:54:41.140 --> 01:54:46.500]  we told people that was coming which then tell you mobile phone or your doctor's mobile phone
[01:54:46.500 --> 01:54:52.420]  when your next dose is due and if you've added to not that's all part of this process of forced um
[01:54:52.420 --> 01:54:57.700]  drugging that this slave and they start it when you get allergy medicine over the counter now
[01:54:57.700 --> 01:55:02.420]  swiping your card and telling you the state police are watching you that's what the smart
[01:55:02.420 --> 01:55:08.500]  dust is about the RFID in their own words a total enslavement grid how do you think the
[01:55:08.500 --> 01:55:13.620]  fight against the the spiders is going how was the fight against the technocrats going well
[01:55:13.620 --> 01:55:23.860]  well what i what i would say um to everybody um in hollywood or elsewhere we now have reached
[01:55:23.860 --> 01:55:30.340]  the point that pussy footing around and doing a little bit and keeping your head down yeah
[01:55:30.340 --> 01:55:34.580]  i'm watching a list show show and read that david ice books uh but i can't say anything
[01:55:34.580 --> 01:55:43.140]  because what about me career those days ladies and gentlemen are over if you have any desire
[01:55:43.140 --> 01:55:51.540]  to live in a world that even has a modicum of freedom there's no more time for messing around
[01:55:51.540 --> 01:55:58.180]  and and and having it and add on to your life this is a time to stand up and be counted to come out
[01:55:58.180 --> 01:56:03.380]  the big hollywood names that that are hiding in the shadows at the moment because they fear the
[01:56:03.380 --> 01:56:09.860]  consequences i tell you what the consequences of not dealing with this now are going to be far
[01:56:09.860 --> 01:56:17.060]  far worse than um exactly or not doing it with the consequences david david people tell me all
[01:56:17.060 --> 01:56:21.300]  the time they go thank you for your courage i would have to have blind crazy courage to not
[01:56:21.300 --> 01:56:26.740]  fight this i'm fighting it because i know how how horrible it is where they're taking us just like
[01:56:26.740 --> 01:56:30.980]  you said wait i'm not doing this because i have courage i'm doing this because i want to survive
[01:56:30.980 --> 01:56:37.220]  and have consciousness and freedom and free will for myself and humanity i hate bondage i hate these
[01:56:37.220 --> 01:56:42.740]  psychopaths that you know the whole royal group that you expose it's all come out in the dead bodies
[01:56:42.740 --> 01:56:49.380]  and the little kids they're and the and the bbc pedophile rings i mean my god it isn't courage
[01:56:49.380 --> 01:56:56.020]  fighting these people my very instinct says we need to absolutely route them the thing is i mean
[01:56:56.020 --> 01:57:05.700]  let's look at it um there was a point uh some time ago where this um control grid was not what it is
[01:57:05.700 --> 01:57:14.500]  uh the manipulation of perception was not as ingrained as it is becoming uh among large numbers
[01:57:14.500 --> 01:57:22.180]  of people who are not working up so as this moves on um more and more people who are not working up
[01:57:22.180 --> 01:57:28.420]  become more and more programmed more and more incapable of free thought and ever seeing what
[01:57:28.420 --> 01:57:35.300]  it is so we can't wait until because what happens you know i've talked about this before is they
[01:57:35.300 --> 01:57:41.620]  push the gate um in other words they'll push the agenda on and if they don't meet resistance
[01:57:41.620 --> 01:57:46.500]  then they'll walk through the gate to the next gate and this is how it moves on so we we have to
[01:57:46.500 --> 01:57:52.500]  when are we going to draw a line in the sand when are people just use this analogy for now but but
[01:57:52.500 --> 01:57:58.740]  an analogy for humanity when are the people in hollywood that understand some of what's going on
[01:57:58.740 --> 01:58:03.700]  and then indeed some of them a lot of what's going on how long are you going to stay silent
[01:58:03.700 --> 01:58:09.540]  what until until there's a knock on the door i mean there won't be anyone around then come on
[01:58:09.540 --> 01:58:15.940]  we have to get on with it now and never never in my 25 years nearly of doing this never have
[01:58:15.940 --> 01:58:22.260]  there been more open minds to to seeing this people are opening their minds now to things they
[01:58:22.260 --> 01:58:28.580]  would have laughed and dismissed by reflex action before this is a fantastic opportunity we're facing
[01:58:28.580 --> 01:58:33.780]  now there was always a time when this was going to break the surface and we're here we're alive now
[01:58:33.780 --> 01:58:37.140]  david do five more minutes with us i know you gotta go i want you to tell us about your book

[02:00:12.740 --> 02:00:22.580]  be he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones well the
[02:00:22.580 --> 02:00:27.940]  new books available now the perception deception i definitely want to read it david ike is on
[02:00:27.940 --> 02:00:30.820]  target as usual david we only got five minutes left i'm going to give you the floor here to
[02:00:31.460 --> 02:00:35.220]  talk about where you see this going and and to talk about the tv network you've been
[02:00:36.100 --> 02:00:42.020]  in the arena launching so so far successfully but but just briefly getting into this
[02:00:42.020 --> 02:00:47.700]  they know as the social engineers that we would respond like this but so much of what they're
[02:00:47.700 --> 02:00:52.020]  doing is backfiring i've learned that for every action is an equal and opposite reaction they're
[02:00:52.020 --> 02:00:57.540]  not invincible they know how to manipulate but they don't have any heart any guts anything
[02:00:58.420 --> 02:01:04.340]  because it is very unhuman what the establishment does so so what what or how are they going to
[02:01:04.340 --> 02:01:10.180]  counter the breakaway where people either become zombies or other people under attack i find are
[02:01:10.180 --> 02:01:17.300]  even becoming more enlightened as a spiritual but also genetic resistance you could almost call it
[02:01:17.300 --> 02:01:23.780]  good mutations spiritually you know to use a strange term that i'm pointing that that will
[02:01:23.780 --> 02:01:32.020]  actually cause humanity to hammer back well you know to understand what's happening and how we
[02:01:32.020 --> 02:01:38.820]  manipulate we really do actually have a greater grasp of the nature of reality and the body is a
[02:01:38.820 --> 02:01:46.740]  holographic projection of the true self which is just consciousness awareness and if you get
[02:01:46.740 --> 02:01:51.860]  pulled is it we see everything's about a point of attention your point of attention could be that
[02:01:51.860 --> 02:01:58.500]  wide or it can be infinite and if it's infinite that point of attention is going to see everything
[02:01:58.500 --> 02:02:02.660]  from a massive symbolically it's going to see it from the top of the mountain top of the hill
[02:02:03.300 --> 02:02:08.260]  if your point of attention is pulled only into the five senses you're only going to see the
[02:02:08.260 --> 02:02:14.420]  world that the five senses can decode and you can perceive which is which is tiny and so this whole
[02:02:14.420 --> 02:02:21.700]  idea of manipulating human perception is to pull our point of attention into the five senses can
[02:02:21.700 --> 02:02:28.900]  i see it touch it taste it hear it okay it must exist then and transhumanism is taking that
[02:02:28.900 --> 02:02:36.100]  another step further because it's putting your point of attention even deeper into the non expanded
[02:02:36.100 --> 02:02:43.380]  consciousness level of self and into this into the senses into the technological senses in terms
[02:02:43.380 --> 02:02:49.860]  of transhumanism that's what it's all about and this kind of radiation massive radiation field
[02:02:49.860 --> 02:02:57.780]  broadcasting within the human brainwave frequency is designed again to hold us in the five senses
[02:02:57.780 --> 02:03:05.460]  once you open your mind to the your true self consciousness and start to think for yourself
[02:03:05.460 --> 02:03:11.300]  and not be aware of the the way that we are programmed to respond and programmed to perceive
[02:03:11.300 --> 02:03:18.020]  suddenly in the world is not little dots that aren't connected the world is a tapestry that is

[02:08:35.220 --> 02:08:41.060]  ladies and gentlemen we are broadcasting worldwide we are now into the third and final hour of
[02:08:41.780 --> 02:08:47.220]  the february 11th worldwide transmission and they say there's no birthday like your 40th birthday
[02:08:47.700 --> 02:08:52.980]  they say that's uh not so much over the hill but you know you're not a spring chick anymore and
[02:08:52.980 --> 02:08:58.020]  it's been an incredible 40 years i want to thank my parents and family for all their help and
[02:08:58.020 --> 02:09:02.980]  guidance and i guess the word is tutelage and all my other mentors and friends some that are
[02:09:03.540 --> 02:09:08.820]  here some that are gone over the next level made the jump into hyperspace but to all our
[02:09:08.820 --> 02:09:13.940]  friends out there in the real media for all freedom lovers for everyone that burns with
[02:09:13.940 --> 02:09:19.860]  the desire for justice and truth and liberty i have just been honored to be alive and conscious
[02:09:19.860 --> 02:09:26.580]  and to be able to commune with my fellow humans and all the other great things on this earth all
[02:09:26.580 --> 02:09:31.700]  the other life forms everything it is it is an incredible experience and they want to immerse
[02:09:31.700 --> 02:09:40.740]  us in the false technotronic age the false time square bombardment and it's brain damaging people
[02:09:40.740 --> 02:09:45.780]  it's lowering IQs it's hurting children it's all on record people say well why are you on tv then
[02:09:45.780 --> 02:09:51.140]  because you have to inject yourself into the matrix to get to the people that are in the
[02:09:51.140 --> 02:09:57.220]  matrix and i live in it and i certainly am a casualty at many levels from blowback uh
[02:09:57.220 --> 02:10:02.180]  from from from being close to this you know be careful as niches said you stare into the abyss
[02:10:02.180 --> 02:10:09.860]  lest you become the abyss and i i have learned the mind of the technocrats to a great extent
[02:10:09.860 --> 02:10:15.700]  and believe me it is unbelievable when you study this as long and as deeply as i have it's it's
[02:10:15.700 --> 02:10:21.860]  one cannot be told about the matrix one must see it for themselves and we are in a science fiction
[02:10:21.860 --> 02:10:28.820]  movie we're in a proto matrix they're trying to insert us into and then you learn in 1977
[02:10:29.220 --> 02:10:36.420]  it was declassified in 19 uh no 2001 it's in my book the sent into tyranny uh and then they
[02:10:36.420 --> 02:10:41.780]  reclassified it strangely enough that they do that sometimes that the pentagon came up with a plan
[02:10:41.780 --> 02:10:47.300]  with darpa of how they would get us incrementally to accept computers take over all communications
[02:10:47.300 --> 02:10:53.220]  predict the future with it track everything and then have handheld computers then goggles then
[02:10:53.220 --> 02:10:59.940]  implants ports and then how we would literally give in to the false reality and give up on the
[02:10:59.940 --> 02:11:04.980]  real world as they made the real world as ugly as possible well i can still go out binoculars
[02:11:04.980 --> 02:11:09.380]  at night and look at alphas and turries or look at uh nebulas ladies and gentlemen i mean there's
[02:11:09.380 --> 02:11:14.660]  beauty everywhere even in the ugliness and when you figure out this it's like it is devilish
[02:11:15.300 --> 02:11:21.940]  how does humans come up with a plan to suppress beauty and and consciousness i mean it is it is
[02:11:21.940 --> 02:11:27.060]  blasphemous it is it is it is it is unbelievable and all and they talk about the earth how they want
[02:11:27.060 --> 02:11:32.340]  to save it all day all they want to do is kill still and destroy and you say oh that's the bible
[02:11:32.340 --> 02:11:37.300]  notice whatever it is it's happening and i'm not sitting here go to these churches and find the
[02:11:37.300 --> 02:11:42.340]  truth that's where the devil lives is these big churches even if the devil is it physically real
[02:11:42.340 --> 02:11:48.340]  or some dimensional entity it doesn't matter it's an archetype in humans manifesting in every culture
[02:11:48.340 --> 02:11:55.300]  and every time but now we can't have black pyramids they're sacrificing kids do every day and then
[02:11:55.300 --> 02:11:59.700]  the culture gets so bad it collapses people go back into the bushes and you know re congregate and
[02:11:59.700 --> 02:12:06.100]  create civilization again now they have all the weapon systems now there's all this
[02:12:06.100 --> 02:12:10.420]  technocracy and everything and it could be like in lannis any day you know the legend of
[02:12:10.420 --> 02:12:15.060]  lannis with the whole island blows up because they release some technology sounds like a hydrogen
[02:12:15.060 --> 02:12:19.060]  bomb i mean we don't know what's really gone on this planet i mean i'll tell you that right now
[02:12:19.940 --> 02:12:25.380]  there's a lot of stuff going on here that we really don't know but the aluma naughty
[02:12:25.380 --> 02:12:30.500]  claim they do know it and i think they do know folks the alexandria library they've proven to
[02:12:30.500 --> 02:12:35.460]  not really burn they got a bunch of it out and then burned it and they know the real histories
[02:12:35.460 --> 02:12:41.300]  and they're using this and and they're using it to cheat so they can run everything and it's it's
[02:12:41.300 --> 02:12:47.060]  it's horrible it's absolutely horrible now for the balance of the hour we're joined here by dr ed
[02:12:47.060 --> 02:12:51.620]  group global healing center dot com i'm not going to go through all his laurels and titles and
[02:12:52.580 --> 02:12:56.340]  the rest of it but he has a lot of gravitas and and and he's not here to do a big
[02:12:57.140 --> 02:13:01.300]  m4slife.com pitch today though that is how we fund our operation we've got a 15 percent
[02:13:01.300 --> 02:13:05.780]  off super mill vitality limited two-week deal we're going to run because it's become so popular
[02:13:05.780 --> 02:13:09.860]  i want to lower the price for folks so they can get introduced to it because to get these type of
[02:13:09.860 --> 02:13:15.780]  pure herbs that are so concentrated and so organic and then it concentrate them like he does
[02:13:15.780 --> 02:13:19.220]  chain stoner by the way started got some of this like two months ago i was like i'll take it and he's
[02:13:19.220 --> 02:13:22.980]  a big sports guy he's like my god what is that he came in here got like 10 bottles the other day
[02:13:22.980 --> 02:13:27.780]  bought 10 bottles i mean that's my good friend chain stoner that's how incredible this stuff is
[02:13:27.780 --> 02:13:33.060]  because we're already so bombarded with estrogen members we're already so chemically attacked
[02:13:33.060 --> 02:13:37.620]  mother nature has the answers to counter this and we come out with a female one it's the exact
[02:13:37.620 --> 02:13:41.700]  same thing as a gimmick folks it even works better for women but the formula was made for me and
[02:13:41.700 --> 02:13:45.140]  we're going to tweak a little bit and have one for women so they feel like it's like a pink
[02:13:45.140 --> 02:13:50.020]  package instead of a blue package i mean whatever the point is women it's it and we didn't put it
[02:13:50.020 --> 02:13:55.300]  out as an aphrodisiac it just so happens that that's what these super herbs do also do that
[02:13:55.300 --> 02:14:01.060]  as well and i'll be honest people i only take half the dose because i already have anger issues
[02:14:02.180 --> 02:14:05.940]  and things and and sometimes it smooths me out sometimes i get a little
[02:14:05.940 --> 02:14:08.740]  little i mean i took some yesterday i was bouncing off the walls folks
[02:14:08.740 --> 02:14:13.700]  even though i had about five hour sleep so dr group joins us today to discuss all of this but

[02:15:14.420 --> 02:15:18.900]  can see on tv right now i mean i didn't even work out or anything for like 14 15 years and
[02:15:18.900 --> 02:15:22.580]  ate like a pig and thought they were going to kill me any day i just didn't care until my
[02:15:22.580 --> 02:15:26.580]  buddy tommy pilotta said hey you're already killing yourself for them because you've already decided
[02:15:26.580 --> 02:15:30.740]  they're going to come after you so you don't care about your life care about your life and i've been
[02:15:30.740 --> 02:15:34.500]  doing that but it's in a slow process but you've helped me supercharge at the last six months
[02:15:34.500 --> 02:15:41.540]  dr group the guy behind infowarslife.com tell us about the the five health secrets well everybody
[02:15:41.540 --> 02:15:45.540]  always asks me you know what can i do what's something simple if you were to pick one thing
[02:15:45.540 --> 02:15:49.300]  what would you pick i mean what's something i can change that's going to have a dramatic effect on
[02:15:49.300 --> 02:15:55.140]  my body right away so my health secret number one is drink clean water i mean we've talked about
[02:15:55.140 --> 02:16:00.020]  you talk about everybody knows that the water is contaminated everywhere with fluoride arsenic
[02:16:00.020 --> 02:16:05.620]  chlorine i mean the list goes on all the medications in the water right now the radiation in the water
[02:16:05.620 --> 02:16:10.900]  from Fukushima so if you think about it the body every living substance is composed of at
[02:16:10.900 --> 02:16:18.100]  least 80 water the earth itself all the plants the humans so if you take the the human body and you
[02:16:18.100 --> 02:16:24.340]  look at it what's happening with all these chemicals and these toxins are it's can they're all
[02:16:24.340 --> 02:16:31.620]  contaminating the water inside of our body so a very simple health secret or solution is to drink
[02:16:31.620 --> 02:16:38.820]  purified water drink something that's going to actually get rid of those toxins from and the
[02:16:38.820 --> 02:16:44.020]  enemy knows that and writes books how they're jacking the water it's on our opinion oh absolutely i
[02:16:44.020 --> 02:16:48.980]  mean in pull up harvard study guys good and the other thing is there's a campaign to get people
[02:16:48.980 --> 02:16:54.660]  to not drink water and to drink other things that dehydrate you if you ask the majority of people
[02:16:54.660 --> 02:17:00.020]  out there i mean basically 90 of the population is chronically dehydrated what do they drink first
[02:17:00.020 --> 02:17:05.300]  thing in the morning coffee then they drink energy drinks throughout the day then they drink alcohol
[02:17:05.300 --> 02:17:11.140]  then they drink sodas with artificial sweeteners in them i mean most people have been conditioned
[02:17:11.140 --> 02:17:16.580]  now to not even like to drink water i read an article you wrote 10 years ago where you talked
[02:17:16.580 --> 02:17:22.740]  about uh artificial sweeteners ascertain making you fat now that's admitted yeah absolutely and so
[02:17:22.740 --> 02:17:27.540]  what what we need it was all done by design to get people to not drink water but another thing
[02:17:27.540 --> 02:17:33.060]  that was done by design was to sell people water too i mean water like out of the toilet no i'm
[02:17:33.060 --> 02:17:37.300]  talking aren't i supposed to only drink brondo the plant's grave i mean well they want you to
[02:17:37.300 --> 02:17:40.740]  drink the tap water that's for sure because it's just going to lead to more disease and
[02:17:40.740 --> 02:17:45.140]  everything else but they want to get you away from they want you to drink others no no my point
[02:17:45.140 --> 02:17:52.020]  is in idiocracy have you seen that movie no you got to see it mic judge genius uh in idiocracy
[02:17:53.540 --> 02:17:58.020]  no one drinks water they drink gatorade called brondo and i think it's a conspiracy theory that
[02:17:58.020 --> 02:18:02.740]  they're even supposed to drink water water is only in the toilet well it's actually happening no i know
[02:18:02.740 --> 02:18:07.220]  it's incredible yeah it's actually happening so uh you know with all the commercials and
[02:18:07.220 --> 02:18:11.140]  everything else that's out there leading you away you're claiming we're supposed to drink water
[02:18:11.140 --> 02:18:15.700]  i'm glad that is a conspiracy you're you're sick i know that's pretty weird hell see that's going
[02:18:15.700 --> 02:18:21.780]  to say babies need mother's milk yeah exactly i am going to say that because the only thing the body
[02:18:21.780 --> 02:18:27.460]  needs and wants after breastfeeding is water the body never tells you hey i want a cola or
[02:18:27.460 --> 02:18:31.540]  i want alcohol or i want any of this other stuff the only thing the body needs and wants
[02:18:31.540 --> 02:18:37.300]  scientifically proven after breastfeeding is water and water only but the water that is so
[02:18:37.300 --> 02:18:43.780]  extreme and sick what you just said it is everybody knows that they want brondo well here's a solution
[02:18:43.780 --> 02:18:47.620]  i mean obviously you want to get a good water purification system for your home if you can
[02:18:47.620 --> 02:18:52.100]  afford it and get rid of all the contaminants because you don't want to be taking a hot shower
[02:18:52.100 --> 02:18:56.180]  you know a 15 minute hot showers the equivalent skin's the biggest organ you're breathing it exactly
[02:18:56.180 --> 02:19:00.260]  seven glasses of tap water come in but here's the secret this is what i do and this is what i
[02:19:00.260 --> 02:19:05.540]  recommend people do get drink distilled water now i used to think you know if you look up the science
[02:19:05.540 --> 02:19:09.300]  and you know years before they say don't drink distilled water because it'll take the nutrients
[02:19:09.300 --> 02:19:14.420]  and the minerals out of your body right now i think we have so many toxins that are contaminated
[02:19:14.420 --> 02:19:20.020]  we need a key light that we need distilled water but i don't recommend just anyone drinking
[02:19:20.020 --> 02:19:24.820]  only distilled water what i recommend they do is they add organic apple cider vinegar into the
[02:19:24.820 --> 02:19:31.540]  distilled water what that does is it's a very it's a very cheap solution to health organic apple
[02:19:31.540 --> 02:19:38.100]  cider vinegar has over a hundred health benefits it has live enzymes in it it has nutrients minerals
[02:19:38.100 --> 02:19:42.820]  substances the mother in there it's actually alive it's been shown to help regulate blood
[02:19:42.820 --> 02:19:47.860]  sugar help with the heart help with weight but i mean why not be like subway with plastic in the
[02:19:47.860 --> 02:19:53.060]  breath don't i need plastic doctor group petrochemicals instead of apples well in most

[02:24:14.740 --> 02:24:20.740]  for commando is also in studio with us now seriously dr. group continuing here so drink
[02:24:20.740 --> 02:24:26.340]  clean water very extreme breathe clean air that's number two health secret number two
[02:24:27.060 --> 02:24:31.780]  on my birthday today you gave me a air purifier for in here in the studio you're so evil
[02:24:32.580 --> 02:24:37.380]  continue here i mean i thought they said the air was safe to breathe on 9-11 well yeah i mean the
[02:24:37.380 --> 02:24:42.580]  air is just completely toxic anywhere you go i mean basically we take 30 000 breaths every single
[02:24:42.580 --> 02:24:49.700]  day and this is why breathe clean air is my second health secret because indoor air is actually
[02:24:49.700 --> 02:24:55.300]  10 times worse than outdoor air and now you have with the radiation fallout you have chem trails
[02:24:55.300 --> 02:24:59.940]  which i've heard that there's even radioactive particles now being sprayed in the chem trails
[02:24:59.940 --> 02:25:04.260]  and the government's going to blame it on fukushima which is this which is just a perfect scapegoat
[02:25:05.540 --> 02:25:09.380]  the fact of the matter is the air is contaminated with fossil fuels and everything else and
[02:25:09.380 --> 02:25:14.260]  and the body takes a beating because all those toxins come in they get stuck in the mucus membranes
[02:25:14.260 --> 02:25:20.500]  leak down into the stomach get absorbed from through the intestinal tract and so what you
[02:25:20.500 --> 02:25:24.580]  have to do is you have to counteract that and the best way that i recommend people to counteract
[02:25:24.580 --> 02:25:30.020]  and breathe clean air you know especially is to start in the home i mean look at all these
[02:25:30.020 --> 02:25:34.260]  memory foam mattresses people are sleeping on with all the fire retardants the volatile
[02:25:34.260 --> 02:25:39.700]  organic compounds inside the homes all the cleaning chemicals that are used inside the homes the air
[02:25:39.700 --> 02:25:46.580]  fresheners all this stuff emit toxic chemical gases inside the home that you're breathing non-stop
[02:25:46.580 --> 02:25:51.940]  and all these contribute to excitotoxins that come into the brain aren't those called eugenics
[02:25:51.940 --> 02:25:56.900]  vitamins they are eugenics it's all part of the whole eugenics things you can break them all down
[02:25:56.900 --> 02:26:01.780]  to you know volatile organic compounds pcbs i mean by the way your dad was a famous chemist so
[02:26:01.780 --> 02:26:06.500]  guess how you know about all this yeah my dad was a chem chemist and but he was in plastics
[02:26:06.500 --> 02:26:10.340]  and still i mean even when you're talking about stuff like that inside the house if you're cooking
[02:26:10.340 --> 02:26:16.740]  with teflon pans you're going to be releasing toxic gases if you're vitamins if you're cooking
[02:26:16.740 --> 02:26:21.540]  your food in the microwave in plastic containers storing your food in plastic containers you know
[02:26:21.540 --> 02:26:25.300]  you you're going to be you could be breathing fumes there's so many different fumes that you're
[02:26:25.300 --> 02:26:30.340]  using toxic pesticides and herbicides outside you can be breathing all that stuff no wonder cancer
[02:26:30.340 --> 02:26:35.460]  rates are up multi thousand points yeah i mean a lot of times people's bedrooms are the most toxic
[02:26:35.460 --> 02:26:40.660]  things they have pets and you have pet dander you have mold and mildew in a lot of the homes that
[02:26:40.660 --> 02:26:45.940]  people are breathing in on it on a regular basis you have so many toxins coming into the air that
[02:26:45.940 --> 02:26:50.580]  it's one of the that's why it's my second health secret is to clean up the air what i recommend
[02:26:50.580 --> 02:26:55.540]  people do is they go to the local nursery plant nursery and they talk to individuals there and
[02:26:55.540 --> 02:27:01.060]  see what indoor plants work the best for their area ferns are really good how do we know though
[02:27:01.060 --> 02:27:04.900]  that people aren't growing marijuana you know in major cities are not having inspections of
[02:27:04.900 --> 02:27:09.460]  gardens just in case this is really i don't know if i can recommend plants in the house
[02:27:10.180 --> 02:27:15.140]  well let me tell you what plants do in the house oh don't this is radical whoa plants are going to
[02:27:15.140 --> 02:27:21.220]  absorb toxic compounds from the air ferns even absorb toxic chemicals and metals it will a
[02:27:21.220 --> 02:27:25.860]  plastic christmas tree work no well sorry about that because you're going to be inhaling all the
[02:27:25.860 --> 02:27:30.660]  plastic fumes and and the volatile organic or just kind of races against plastic christmas trees
[02:27:30.660 --> 02:27:35.140]  well they shouldn't be producing plastic christmas trees anyway why are you discriminating against
[02:27:35.140 --> 02:27:38.980]  the christmas trees you should just get a live plant for christmas or something like that but
[02:27:39.540 --> 02:27:43.860]  anyway you know that's a whole issue with you know do i cut down a tree and use it for a christmas
[02:27:43.860 --> 02:27:49.140]  tree or do i get a fake tree but what they should be doing is using other compounds that are safer
[02:27:49.140 --> 02:27:53.700]  instead of plastic to to manufacture lighting a bureaucrat on fire or something like that but
[02:27:54.260 --> 02:27:59.780]  anyway just by putting three live plants in every single room of your house because plants
[02:27:59.780 --> 02:28:05.140]  increase the oxygen content in the air too and just by doing that you're going to be cleaning
[02:28:05.140 --> 02:28:09.060]  up your house and then of course eliminating all the toxic chemicals and household cleaners and
[02:28:09.060 --> 02:28:14.740]  everything like that but really i tell people focus on your home and your office first and even get a
[02:28:14.740 --> 02:28:19.700]  whole house air purification system like the remi unit or like the one that i gave you that's not
[02:28:19.700 --> 02:28:24.820]  my company i'm not affiliated with them but that was the only company's air purification system that
[02:28:24.820 --> 02:28:29.940]  produces ionized hydroperoxides in the air and it was the one that was used by china when the sars
[02:28:29.940 --> 02:28:34.660]  epidemic came out what i love about it is you could put it in your hvac system and it actually
[02:28:34.660 --> 02:28:39.220]  cleans all the air throughout all your vents and it comes down into the rooms and it's key to change
[02:28:39.220 --> 02:28:44.340]  your filters out a lot yeah clean your clean your air filters out and just make an environment a
[02:28:44.340 --> 02:28:48.180]  non-toxic environment because we've been taught not to care about ourselves like it's kind of cool
[02:28:48.180 --> 02:28:52.340]  not change the filters it's kind of cool to die of cancer early yeah i mean what you could do too
[02:28:52.340 --> 02:28:57.460]  is you could put those little himalayan crystal salt lamps around you know that produce the the
[02:28:57.460 --> 02:29:02.180]  little salt fumes into the air you can use aromatherapy diffusers to kind of put clean the
[02:29:02.180 --> 02:29:07.620]  air in your home but it's really important to clean the air in your office and your home and the next
[02:29:07.620 --> 02:29:12.820]  time that you get carpeting in your house or the next time you paint the walls in your house you
[02:29:12.820 --> 02:29:19.780]  want to use organic or wool or some sort of something that's low voce or free of voces and slowly
[02:29:19.780 --> 02:29:23.700]  start cleaning the air quality in your home all right we've covered number one drink clean water
[02:29:23.700 --> 02:29:27.620]  that's an extreme conspiracy theory and under the fairness doctrine i want to say those are his
[02:29:27.620 --> 02:29:34.260]  opinions okay he says you want clean air that's his opinion i want to be fair here with the government
[02:29:34.260 --> 02:29:41.460]  airtime uh now he's got a really three four and five are really radical folks even more radical
[02:29:41.460 --> 02:29:46.340]  than what you've just heard from dr grubb of inforcelife.com we're going to come right back
[02:29:46.340 --> 02:29:50.420]  and it's it's it's going to be shocking but it's it's going to continue the show is so radical
[02:29:50.420 --> 02:29:54.420]  i just can't believe we've gone this far listen you're laughing it's not funny what she's done
[02:29:54.420 --> 02:29:58.100]  okay i know oh six six six
[02:30:00.660 --> 02:30:06.740]  in the last 50 years iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen
[02:30:06.740 --> 02:30:13.380]  bromine a practice now banned in nations around the world guess what else is in the halogen family
[02:30:13.380 --> 02:30:19.460]  fluoride ladies and gentlemen alex jones here in 1924 the federal government did the right thing
[02:30:19.460 --> 02:30:25.940]  and encouraged salt producers to add iodine it's the good halogen on the periodic table and the
[02:30:25.940 --> 02:30:32.660]  results are on record reports documented a 15 point iq increase in areas that had previously
[02:30:32.660 --> 02:30:39.300]  been deficient in iodine bottom line iodine is important unbound clean in a glycerin base

[02:35:22.420 --> 02:35:28.980]  victim in front of witnesses and then made fun of the cancer survivors diaper and and i've been
[02:35:28.980 --> 02:35:36.180]  made fun of by tsa bureaucrats they're not agents and i've seen them do it to other people and my
[02:35:36.180 --> 02:35:40.420]  grandmother on crutches when they went to a wedding in mexico when my cousin were never
[02:35:40.420 --> 02:35:45.060]  wedding down in mexico and they yell let her mean to her and said hurry up you old lady and my dad
[02:35:45.060 --> 02:35:48.500]  who was with her it's not his mom's my mom's mom but he loves her as much as his late mom
[02:35:49.140 --> 02:35:54.020]  literally said never in his life to almost punch someone you know in the government but he almost
[02:35:54.020 --> 02:35:59.380]  you know like these people screaming at her hatefully this is how sick it's getting and it
[02:35:59.380 --> 02:36:04.580]  shows just a poisoned mentally ill group i want to get back in uh to number one clean water how
[02:36:04.580 --> 02:36:08.980]  to do it number two breathe clean air then number three number four number five in a moment but
[02:36:08.980 --> 02:36:14.100]  what do you think's happening culturally right now with all this insanity because people are
[02:36:14.100 --> 02:36:18.260]  either going completely insane or they're waking up what do you what do you think's going on dr
[02:36:18.260 --> 02:36:23.460]  group one of the things that's happening is as people claim clean their body and they understand
[02:36:23.460 --> 02:36:26.820]  what you're talking about and they understand where all these chemicals and where they're
[02:36:26.820 --> 02:36:30.660]  being attacked from at least they're waking up and they can do something about it because there
[02:36:30.660 --> 02:36:35.380]  is a solution to every problem if you understand the poisons in the water and you drink clean water
[02:36:35.380 --> 02:36:38.820]  that's a solution if you understand they're poisoning the food and you're eating clean food
[02:36:38.820 --> 02:36:44.180]  that's something else and then when when the when the fluoride and when the calcification of the
[02:36:44.180 --> 02:36:49.300]  pineal and when they start eliminating all the msg and the excitotoxins they start waking up i mean
[02:36:49.300 --> 02:36:54.020]  when it's your body is consumed with all these chemicals and all these toxins and all these
[02:36:54.020 --> 02:37:00.740]  eugenic things it it really causes nonaggressiveness it causes non motivation and as you clean your
[02:37:00.740 --> 02:37:04.900]  body and as you become aware like what you're saying people are waking up and it's not so
[02:37:04.900 --> 02:37:10.820]  conspiracy conspiracy conspiracy anymore it's becoming mainstream because people are finding
[02:37:10.820 --> 02:37:14.980]  out and the government's in a last-ditch effort right now i think because they're just using every
[02:37:14.980 --> 02:37:22.740]  single resource that they can to try to control to watch us to do everything because they know and
[02:37:22.740 --> 02:37:26.980]  they can see that the words actually getting out there and that we're actually trying to help people
[02:37:26.980 --> 02:37:31.380]  and we're giving people solutions and people are waking up and more people are coming forward and
[02:37:31.380 --> 02:37:35.220]  talking to their senators and their legislators and everything else to try to do something about it
[02:37:35.220 --> 02:37:38.820]  i was joking about earlier because we make the jokes that you're the green beret doctor here at
[02:37:38.820 --> 02:37:41.700]  the office but of course they didn't call it green berets after vietnam but you were in army
[02:37:41.700 --> 02:37:47.460]  special operations and a lot of secret stuff in in on the north korean dmc and a lot of other
[02:37:47.460 --> 02:37:50.420]  stuff you know welden have really hit it off talking about stuff he did over there in the
[02:37:50.420 --> 02:37:56.500]  air force but uh why do you think they say the number one enemy is veterans and does that offend
[02:37:56.500 --> 02:38:01.300]  you as a veteran seven years in the u.s army uh before you went and got your degrees does that
[02:38:01.300 --> 02:38:06.980]  offend you to to to have them saying you're the enemy and why do you think they say you're the enemy
[02:38:06.980 --> 02:38:13.860]  i think that they say that the veterans are the enemy because you know they're scared of the
[02:38:13.860 --> 02:38:18.340]  veterans in a way because there's so many veterans my phone rings off the hook with
[02:38:18.340 --> 02:38:22.980]  post traumatic stress disorder and all these veterans that are actually waking up to what's
[02:38:22.980 --> 02:38:29.540]  going on with them being used as experiments for injections of different compounds when they have no
[02:38:29.540 --> 02:38:33.300]  say so when they're going through the lines that happened to me i don't know what that was injected
[02:38:33.300 --> 02:38:39.860]  into me at different times i think that the if you look at the meals ready to eat in the military
[02:38:39.860 --> 02:38:45.940]  you know the way that they use hormone disruptors sterility products on military personnel the way
[02:38:45.940 --> 02:38:51.220]  that the depleted uranium and and throughout afghanistan and everything is exposing the
[02:38:51.220 --> 02:38:56.660]  military personnel gulf war syndrome when they're all this stuff that the military are bringing
[02:38:56.660 --> 02:39:02.580]  back i think that we have a smarter veteran group right now it's a smarter military because i see
[02:39:02.580 --> 02:39:08.340]  more and more military personnel asking questions about hey wait a second why am i why are they doing
[02:39:08.340 --> 02:39:13.300]  this to me and i see you know even with the government coming out and saying we know will
[02:39:13.300 --> 02:39:18.340]  you fire on citizens and asking military personnel will you fire on citizens in the military i think
[02:39:18.340 --> 02:39:22.660]  they're worried about a coup i mean a military coup and the veterans may be joining in on that
[02:39:23.700 --> 02:39:27.620]  no that they're definitely worried about that and they want to replace the military with robots as
[02:39:27.620 --> 02:39:34.260]  quickly as possible yeah exactly yeah exactly so i mean i think that you know for the first time
[02:39:34.260 --> 02:39:39.620]  over the last five or ten years if you know especially over the last five years with the
[02:39:39.620 --> 02:39:43.540]  amount of information that you're putting out there and with the internet with people actually
[02:39:43.540 --> 02:39:48.340]  being able to cross reference things and actually see that this isn't just stuff that you're talking
[02:39:48.340 --> 02:39:52.580]  about and that we're saying because i talk about the same thing look you know first i'll say yeah
[02:39:52.580 --> 02:39:56.260]  fluoride is damaging it's an endocrine disruptor blah blah blah blah blah it's going to shut down
[02:39:56.260 --> 02:40:00.660]  your thyroid it's going to lead to all these conditions they think i'm crazy because they're
[02:40:00.660 --> 02:40:05.540]  like well how can that be it's in the toothpaste it's in the mouthwash they have water out there
[02:40:05.540 --> 02:40:11.060]  with fluoride it's hidden in blind here water now i just said look just do your own research on it
[02:40:11.060 --> 02:40:14.500]  vaccine issue i mean everything you know everything we're talking about but people are
[02:40:14.500 --> 02:40:18.980]  actually they're hearing it from other friends now it's like their friends are talking about it
[02:40:18.980 --> 02:40:25.140]  people in their circles are talking about it uh people are actually waking up and they're seeing
[02:40:25.140 --> 02:40:30.500]  the results too of the people that are actually doing something about it and greening their home
[02:40:31.220 --> 02:40:35.940]  in other words getting rid of all the toxic compounds real greening not to pay algor money
[02:40:35.940 --> 02:40:40.340]  on carbon exactly yeah i mean they're actually aware and they're not buying the round up and
[02:40:40.340 --> 02:40:45.860]  they're not buying the toxic chemicals and they're cleaning their body on a daily on a regular basis
[02:40:45.860 --> 02:40:49.860]  and they're detoxifying their home they're they're paying more attention to what they're giving their
[02:40:49.860 --> 02:40:54.820]  kids uh were you awake to all this stuff when you got out of high school and joined the military and
[02:40:54.820 --> 02:41:00.660]  then went to college i mean when did you wake up i actually woke up to it in a weird way because i had
[02:41:00.660 --> 02:41:05.780]  studied pharmaceuticals and everything and i was i was kind of brainwashed into calling everybody
[02:41:05.780 --> 02:41:10.180]  else a quack until i met somebody i originally i wanted to be a medical doctor and be a heart
[02:41:10.180 --> 02:41:14.740]  surgeon that was my dream and that's what i was studying and i was brainwashed i met a guy that
[02:41:14.740 --> 02:41:19.860]  was treating cancer naturally and we kind of got into a little argument you know i was brainwashed
[02:41:19.860 --> 02:41:23.860]  to think that natural medicine was all quackery and stuff like that and he looked at me he said he
[02:41:23.860 --> 02:41:28.740]  knew i had a background in chemistry and biochemistry he said fine i'm not going to argue with you
[02:41:28.740 --> 02:41:34.580]  pick any prescription drug you want and tell me how that does any good on the body i said all right
[02:41:34.580 --> 02:41:38.580]  that's not a problem at all i mean what we wouldn't have prescription drugs if they weren't good for
[02:41:38.580 --> 02:41:43.780]  us so i went to the library brought out all the biochemical books chemical books took a couple
[02:41:43.780 --> 02:41:51.780]  prescription medications broke them down chemistry wise looked at the how they work on the body and
[02:41:51.780 --> 02:41:56.980]  in about two hours i realized that was my wake-up call that's when just like everything opened up
[02:41:56.980 --> 02:42:04.820]  i realized i saw it i had like a vision and i saw the damage that was being done worldwide
[02:42:04.820 --> 02:42:11.140]  with pharmaceuticals that they're not designed to do anything but cover up a symptom you you
[02:42:11.140 --> 02:42:15.460]  you malfunctioned can you talk about your dad on air and the bisphenol way yeah i can talk about
[02:42:15.460 --> 02:42:20.580]  my dad on air sure don't tell people briefly about him uh well what my dad was a chemist he
[02:42:20.580 --> 02:42:26.100]  was one of the top chemists for exxon actually and he was he he did his dissertation or his first phd
[02:42:26.100 --> 02:42:31.140]  yeah we looked him up it's pretty amazing yeah i mean so so basically he was a co-inventor of
[02:42:31.140 --> 02:42:36.100]  saran wrap and he was like the leading guy in the leading chemist one on plastics i mean he was the
[02:42:36.100 --> 02:42:42.340]  one that was going around teaching and lecturing about how plasticizers epoxy resins anything
[02:42:42.340 --> 02:42:47.780]  that had to do with plastics um he was he actually worked for the government i don't know what he was
[02:42:47.780 --> 02:42:53.780]  doing when the reagan administration i know he was involved with uh the drug war putting something
[02:42:53.780 --> 02:43:01.220]  in the chemicals they were using to make cocaine with and um recently i know when he died it was
[02:43:01.220 --> 02:43:05.540]  a very fast death and i was always wondering because i remember a group of people that like
[02:43:05.540 --> 02:43:09.540]  all these guys showed up at my mom's house with these documents and like forcing her to sign this
[02:43:09.540 --> 02:43:15.300]  stuff and he would he was dead within like he had throat cancer and spinal cancer and he was
[02:43:15.300 --> 02:43:22.100]  dead within two weeks and i was like how does that happen you know and at that point in time they
[02:43:22.100 --> 02:43:25.300]  just offered her a bunch of money my mom it wasn't a bunch of money i think it was like
[02:43:25.300 --> 02:43:31.780]  $120,000 or something like that she signed up off all these documents all of his records were sealed
[02:43:31.780 --> 02:43:38.580]  in other words through exxon nobody could get access to him i found out only about six months ago
[02:43:38.580 --> 02:43:45.380]  that he was about to go public right before he died with reversing all of his original research
[02:43:45.380 --> 02:43:49.540]  because i this whole time i'm thinking oh my gosh i can't believe my dad was involved in plastics
[02:43:49.540 --> 02:43:53.940]  and now i'm trying to clean up all this stuff it's really weird how that works but i just found
[02:43:53.940 --> 02:43:59.620]  out that he was about to publish a bunch of reports on the damaging effects of plastics
[02:43:59.620 --> 02:44:05.460]  and he was involved with some research at some you know agency and they were found finding that
[02:44:05.460 --> 02:44:10.100]  these plastic compounds they were developing were causing cancer in animals and it was probably one
[02:44:10.100 --> 02:44:17.060]  of the most toxic for humanity for the environment and for humanity and he was about to go public
[02:44:17.060 --> 02:44:24.020]  with this research and then you know i think he was killed off and that's the story of my dad and
[02:44:24.020 --> 02:44:30.260]  you know now we're talking about all the toxic you know effects of plastics everywhere you know
[02:44:30.260 --> 02:44:35.700]  we talked about water we're about to put plasticizers in the bread illegally ever it's illegal
[02:44:35.700 --> 02:44:41.380]  everywhere else yes it's illegal everywhere else and now you know now that subway came out and
[02:44:41.380 --> 02:44:45.140]  said that they're gonna actually take it out in the united states but we're talking about food
[02:44:45.140 --> 02:44:51.860]  that is health secret number three which is eat clean food i mean we know the food is contaminated
[02:44:51.860 --> 02:44:57.940]  it's another eugenics system the food is being man-made it's genetically modified
[02:44:57.940 --> 02:45:03.380]  it which causes the bt toxin to be produced in the human gut which burns holes through the
[02:45:03.380 --> 02:45:07.700]  intestinal lining which leads to all kinds of allergies leads to all kinds of other problems
[02:45:07.700 --> 02:45:14.020]  in the system you have pesticides in foods insecticides in food you have dead food i mean what
[02:45:14.020 --> 02:45:19.700]  we we're actually herbivores in nature you know we're not really carnivorous we've kind of you
[02:45:19.700 --> 02:45:26.340]  know evolved into that but a carnivorous animal has canine teeth to rip and chew flesh we don't
[02:45:26.340 --> 02:45:32.820]  secrete hydrochloric acid in its mouth we don't as a pipe like digestive system we don't and you
[02:45:32.820 --> 02:45:37.140]  know if you look at a carnivorous animal we're not even really omnivores no we're just we're
[02:45:37.140 --> 02:45:41.460]  herbivorous in nature and we're designed to eat you we don't have a pipe like digestive system and
[02:45:41.460 --> 02:45:46.740]  we're supposed to eat more live fruits vegetables and stuff like that but we've been conditioned
[02:45:46.740 --> 02:45:52.980]  to not do that and to eat all these toxic chemical ridden foods now with meat having all the hormones
[02:45:52.980 --> 02:45:58.260]  injected in them it takes a three years to get a calf ready i mean one year instead of three
[02:45:58.260 --> 02:46:05.300]  years to get a calf ready the containment there's 500 000 cattle you know butchered you know every
[02:46:05.300 --> 02:46:11.780]  week i think something like that the point of the matter is it's very simple the way that we change
[02:46:11.780 --> 02:46:17.940]  everything in society is we just don't buy it you know if you don't buy the chemicals you know
[02:46:17.940 --> 02:46:22.900]  household cleaners then they go out of business if you don't buy the toxic foods they go out of
[02:46:22.900 --> 02:46:30.340]  business you know you force them into producing organic things i mean the demand for organic
[02:46:30.340 --> 02:46:35.140]  foods the demand to to not sell foods that are genetically model it's a model of success for
[02:46:35.140 --> 02:46:39.860]  everything else yeah is actually we're actually starting to see it work i mean just look what
[02:46:39.860 --> 02:46:43.940]  happened with the subway thing with the with the plasticizers in the bread the petition that the
[02:46:43.940 --> 02:46:48.260]  food babe did now we launched that on the show exactly now all of a sudden they came out and
[02:46:48.260 --> 02:46:52.980]  they're in there taking it out it takes that grassroots effort from everybody to step forward
[02:46:52.980 --> 02:47:00.420]  and to not support these chemical you know the industrial complex you know the medical industrial
[02:47:00.420 --> 02:47:04.900]  complex with pharmaceuticals and everything else and we're seeing that people are turning away also
[02:47:06.020 --> 02:47:09.380]  from the prescription drugs too and they're looking for natural alternatives especially
[02:47:09.380 --> 02:47:15.380]  with this obama care disaster that's that's coming in so my solution is as far as the health secret
[02:47:15.380 --> 02:47:21.380]  number three which is eat clean foods is avoid gmo's the best way to do that is to avoid anything
[02:47:21.380 --> 02:47:26.020]  that has corn and soy in it of course because that's also going to be you know the soy is going to
[02:47:26.020 --> 02:47:32.660]  be another estrogen disruptor and to go organic you know eat organic if you can't afford organic
[02:47:32.660 --> 02:47:37.540]  go to your local farmers markets i mean every city has one well people are buying so much
[02:47:37.540 --> 02:47:43.860]  organic it's going down in price now as it creates a market now moving right along to number four
[02:47:43.860 --> 02:47:47.860]  reduce your stress levels well this is one i could follow yeah i mean you know this is a health
[02:47:47.860 --> 02:47:52.340]  secret number four which is one of the things that i i think is so damaging because when you
[02:47:52.340 --> 02:47:56.580]  look at you know everybody a lot of people walk around there's so many people on antidepressants
[02:47:56.580 --> 02:48:02.980]  now kids are being put on adhd drugs right now they're thinking that it's just some weird thing
[02:48:02.980 --> 02:48:07.860]  that people are born with it's crazy i guarantee you if this continues it'll be a conspiracy soon
[02:48:07.860 --> 02:48:12.580]  that people that everyone wasn't always on it it'll be like i heard people didn't used to all
[02:48:12.580 --> 02:48:18.420]  beyond this that's a lie that's that's the criminal mount them the evil terrorist right we remember
[02:48:18.420 --> 02:48:24.820]  a day when there wasn't people on anti-anxiety adhd drugs or remember a day when there wasn't
[02:48:24.820 --> 02:48:31.220]  any such thing as add adhd which are all created to sell you they put us in an artificial environment
[02:48:31.220 --> 02:48:36.660]  the bad food the dies people start freaking out their answer is here's these drugs that on record
[02:48:36.660 --> 02:48:42.660]  for most people make it worse and are incredibly toxic well here's what causes depression and stress
[02:48:42.660 --> 02:48:48.580]  and anxiety and add and adhd what causes it is the electromagnetic frequencies the radiation
[02:48:48.580 --> 02:48:54.500]  people are exposed to through cell phones through cell phone towers everywhere the chemicals in the
[02:48:54.500 --> 02:49:01.780]  food the chemicals in the water the chemicals in the air they're all neurological uh degradation
[02:49:01.780 --> 02:49:06.580]  compounds they're excitotoxins they either excite the nerves i mean if you put a drop of aluminum
[02:49:06.580 --> 02:49:13.860]  and mercury on a nerve tissue in the brain you can see how fast it completely fries it and and
[02:49:13.860 --> 02:49:20.660]  denatures it so hey guys pull up uh mercury uh in brain cell the university of calgary it'll
[02:49:20.660 --> 02:49:25.620]  come up just sits on youtube uh just mercury brain cells video go ahead so it's not that people are
[02:49:25.620 --> 02:49:30.980]  suffering from depression and anxiety and adhd all these mental disorders it's the fact that
[02:49:30.980 --> 02:49:35.140]  they're being caused by all these chemicals and toxins and everything which they know i mean you
[02:49:35.140 --> 02:49:39.140]  go to public school it's twinkies coax you're going to have a sugar crash you're going to bounce off
[02:49:39.140 --> 02:49:44.420]  the walls i mean i mean if i i mean it's like if i gave my kids that stuff that i mean i take them
[02:49:44.420 --> 02:49:48.500]  to a birthday party that's the only time they're bad is after a piece of cake they're like demons
[02:49:48.500 --> 02:49:53.060]  right i mean so another thing with cleaning up your food is don't eat high fruit don't drink
[02:49:53.060 --> 02:49:58.900]  high fructose corn syrup or don't eat it you know avoid the artificial dyes the artificial colors
[02:49:58.900 --> 02:50:03.700]  avoid the white flour which has bromine in it instead of iodine which it used to have in there
[02:50:03.700 --> 02:50:07.380]  avoid and folks you're going to find when you've been on this bad stuff for a while
[02:50:08.100 --> 02:50:11.780]  as soon as you start eating regular real food it's almost weird and you're kind of like
[02:50:11.780 --> 02:50:15.860]  because the poisons are addictive but as you start to phase it out which i've slowly done
[02:50:15.860 --> 02:50:22.100]  my problem is i work too much don't sleep i mean it's crazy but i i i i'm reversing so much of it
[02:50:22.100 --> 02:50:28.660]  and it's amazing well that is the solution to and the more people that actually do that
[02:50:28.660 --> 02:50:34.100]  the more people that become awake you know you talk about increasing the consciousness and eliminating
[02:50:34.100 --> 02:50:38.580]  the amount of toxins on a regular basis is what increases the content watch what mercury does on
[02:50:38.580 --> 02:50:44.260]  that tv screen of your tv viewer they put mercury into the solution and that it just hammers it down
[02:50:44.260 --> 02:50:47.860]  and kills it they haven't released it yet they release in here in just a moment we're gonna

[02:54:18.340 --> 02:54:24.180]  it's an amazing product briefly tell folks why supermail vitality is is is so different people
[02:54:24.180 --> 02:54:27.700]  people should take the challenge and get a bottle of it and then try it and see what it does women
[02:54:27.700 --> 02:54:34.820]  can take it as well as you've said uh and break down what these organic purified concentrated
[02:54:34.820 --> 02:54:39.620]  herbs herbs do because you last time you were on took you talked about the estrogen stuff
[02:54:39.620 --> 02:54:44.500]  this is a way to block that out as well yeah absolutely i mean the fact of the matter is
[02:54:44.500 --> 02:54:49.620]  we're living in an estrogen dominant society and i wanted to give back to the men out there and
[02:54:49.620 --> 02:54:53.700]  and help balance the women as well because i mean there's so many estrogen mimickers
[02:54:53.700 --> 02:54:59.380]  there's so many things that decrease the amount of testosterone growth hormone dha and men and
[02:54:59.380 --> 02:55:04.660]  women and there's really nothing out there that's natural i mean now the big push for hrt is
[02:55:04.660 --> 02:55:10.020]  pharmaceutical based because they want everybody on uh testosterone they take our hormones away and
[02:55:10.020 --> 02:55:13.620]  then we have to go buy them back yeah i mean who knows where those hormones are coming from
[02:55:13.620 --> 02:55:20.180]  anyway and any it's not good to put the hormone in the body because then your body stops producing
[02:55:20.180 --> 02:55:24.420]  it if you keep it in there for a period that's right these herbs that you put together you were
[02:55:24.420 --> 02:55:28.900]  saying just just makes the glands naturally turn back on yeah exactly i mean that's the whole purpose
[02:55:28.900 --> 02:55:34.980]  of it what i wanted to do is bring together some some rare herbs in a powerful therapeutic dosage
[02:55:35.620 --> 02:55:42.260]  to naturally stimulate and balance the hormone production the natural hormone production in
[02:55:42.260 --> 02:55:48.020]  males and females so that's what it was designed to do and with the technology that we have with
[02:55:48.020 --> 02:55:54.260]  the nanotechnology and the extraction mechanism that we have to where we can extract 98 percent
[02:55:54.260 --> 02:56:00.020]  of the herb material and we can use that in a synergistic or a balanced approach and concentrate
[02:56:00.020 --> 02:56:08.820]  it uh you know you're going to get uh us almost the equivalent of a pharmaceutical but a natural
[02:56:08.820 --> 02:56:13.300]  product which is made with organic stuff which is not going to harm you over a period of time
[02:56:13.300 --> 02:56:17.860]  man i tell you the the three products you helped us develop we tracked down the coffee after years
[02:56:17.860 --> 02:56:24.100]  ourselves in mexico uh that are in fours life dot com i mean it's just nothing but positive reviews
[02:56:24.100 --> 02:56:27.140]  we i mean and i've promoted other supplements that are great as well in fours health dot com
[02:56:27.140 --> 02:56:30.660]  they're wonderful but i mean i've never seen anything like this within fours life dot com i
[02:56:30.660 --> 02:56:34.340]  mean the stuff you helped us put together it's phenomenal because i did a lot of research you
[02:56:34.340 --> 02:56:38.260]  know what is the best what is the best what is the best and i took the proprietary blend before
[02:56:38.260 --> 02:56:43.460]  they were mass produced myself like whoa like you said i had the detox the first months with the iodine
[02:56:43.460 --> 02:56:47.700]  i'd take another iodine didn't do this other iodine hurt my stomach it made me hurt when i
[02:56:47.700 --> 02:56:52.340]  peed this doesn't do that and how do you come up with all this it's just well first of all i don't
[02:56:52.340 --> 02:56:57.460]  produce anything unless i would take it myself and i and i use it myself and i test it on myself
[02:56:57.460 --> 02:57:01.940]  and i it takes a long time i mean the super male vitality was something i was working on for seven
[02:57:01.940 --> 02:57:06.900]  years it just so happens that you came along and and at at the same culmination of we're having all
[02:57:06.900 --> 02:57:13.300]  this feminism and we're having all these problems and this with hormones and in functioning hormones
[02:57:13.300 --> 02:57:18.740]  there's just no solution out there so it was more let's see if we can put this thing together and
[02:57:18.740 --> 02:57:23.380]  with the r&d behind it and see if we can make something that actually works so we can because
[02:57:23.380 --> 02:57:26.500]  we were talking about this almost a year ago and it took him just a few months ago for
[02:57:27.060 --> 02:57:30.420]  and then months to get it produced and then the ride herb didn't come in from the
[02:57:31.060 --> 02:57:35.940]  himalayas it just goes on and on but we finally got it yeah whenever i develop products i want to
[02:57:35.940 --> 02:57:40.900]  make sure they're the best in the world guaranteed and no you use the raw herbs not dried when you

[03:00:59.780 --> 03:01:04.180]  big one i mean just we didn't give the solutions for the the stress levels i mean one of the best
[03:01:04.180 --> 03:01:09.220]  ways to reduce your stress levels is actually bringing yourself from a sympathetic state into a
[03:01:09.220 --> 03:01:14.660]  parasympathetic state parasympathetic state is when your body is calm and not in a in a high level
[03:01:14.660 --> 03:01:20.420]  of stress everything is designed to keep you in high level of stress whether it's media driven
[03:01:20.420 --> 03:01:24.740]  whether it's chemical driven anything they want you stressed out because they know when you're
[03:01:24.740 --> 03:01:30.580]  stressed your body goes into a stressful situation and your immune system is immediately dropped by
[03:01:30.580 --> 03:01:34.740]  50 percent when you're in a state of stress you know you have a hard time having bowel movements and
[03:01:34.740 --> 03:01:39.380]  if you can't have bowel movements as a matter of fact the average person out there has two bowel
[03:01:39.380 --> 03:01:46.180]  movements a week that's because they're so stressed out all the time so nine deep breaths is the fastest
[03:01:46.180 --> 03:01:52.260]  way hard hillary's never had a bowel movement that's why she looks like a job of the hut stuff with
[03:01:52.260 --> 03:01:56.580]  dead rats i tell you what if you look at everybody in washington i don't think anyone's had had a
