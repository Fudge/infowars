[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:25.000]  From the InfoWars.com News Center, deep behind enemy lines in occupied Texas, broadcasting
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000]  worldwide, you're listening to the voice of human resistance against the Technotronic
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:41.000]  Technocracy takeover. You're listening to Alex Jones. The suicide bomber's been identified.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:49.000]  His handiwork, Salman Abadi, 23, and tens of thousands of jihadists have poured into
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000]  Europe. Here's some of their handiwork. Last night, when the country that welcomed
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000]  him with open arms was attacked.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:47.000]  No. Ladies and gentlemen, there are 5 million people plus that have been brought into Europe
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000]  in the last four years. 80% of our military aged men, according to Interpol. The United
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000]  Nations ran a public program to recruit jihadists from the Arab Spring, from Africa, the Middle
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:07.000]  East, from Eastern Europe, from places like Chechnya, to come to Germany, France,
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000]  Belgium, Sweden, the UK, Canada, the United States.
[00:02:13.356 --> 00:02:21.356]  And they have pledged allegiance to ISIS and Al-Qaeda, they have pledged allegiance to attack our countries.
[00:02:21.356 --> 00:02:41.356]  And then every time there's an attack, which you're intensifying all the time, with the shootings, the truck attacks, the bombings, the media comes out, and I've got articles on InfoWars.com, and blames conservatism and says that Islamophobia is what is making these people attack us.
[00:02:41.308 --> 00:02:51.507]  That story is up on InfoWars.com where the left was very very quick to come out and bemoan
[00:02:51.507 --> 00:02:56.308]  Islamophobia backlash on social media following Manchester terror attack.
[00:02:56.308 --> 00:03:01.988]  So not only is the left and these globalist systems we have to blame for bringing in
[00:03:01.988 --> 00:03:07.188]  these vipers, on top of it they blame those of us that have warned of it and say it's
[00:03:07.188 --> 00:03:16.668]  our fault. And then a bunch of well-meaning teenagers, some of them children, while you
[00:03:16.668 --> 00:03:21.628]  let your kids go to a rock concert when they're eight years old, get attacked and I point
[00:03:21.628 --> 00:03:27.947]  out it's liberal, wide open UK and the liberal policies that are to blame for that in the
[00:03:27.947 --> 00:03:33.947]  aggregate on average more than half the Brits are the liberal trendies that would
[00:03:33.947 --> 00:03:38.507]  walk off a plank, who would jump off of a cliff, who would slip their own rest, cut
[00:03:38.507 --> 00:03:44.067]  their own heads off, they were told it was trendy. And it's so sad to see mass Stockholm
[00:03:44.067 --> 00:03:50.788]  syndrome. I don't blame the victims. I blame the culture, the brainwashing, the
[00:03:50.788 --> 00:03:56.668]  globalist for turning people into cult members who will go along with religions and systems
[00:03:56.668 --> 00:04:00.348]  that are diametrically opposed to their own supposed beliefs.
[00:04:00.456 --> 00:04:09.495]  It's sick, but then Media Matters' David Brock comes out, because what do you do?
[00:04:09.495 --> 00:04:14.335]  What do you do when you push this agenda of open borders and bringing in the Islamicists
[00:04:14.335 --> 00:04:19.515]  and they keep raping people and they keep, you know, killing people and they fit the
[00:04:19.515 --> 00:04:23.536]  bill for being the rape-u-gees that we call them?
[00:04:23.536 --> 00:04:24.536]  What do you do?
[00:04:24.536 --> 00:04:29.716]  You turn it around and you say, oh no, it's the right-winger's fault, it's Alex
[00:04:29.876 --> 00:04:35.276]  Brock's fault, he stirred up the Muslims or he blames the children that got blown up.
[00:04:35.276 --> 00:04:41.956]  No, I blame the parents and I blame the liberals and I blame anyone who called for open borders
[00:04:41.956 --> 00:04:43.476]  to bring these rattlesnakes in.
[00:04:43.476 --> 00:04:46.796]  If I bring a rattlesnake in and stick it under your bed and it bites you, it's
[00:04:46.796 --> 00:04:48.676]  my fault.
[00:04:48.676 --> 00:04:51.996]  But if you know I've stuck a rattlesnake in there and you go along with it as well,
[00:04:51.996 --> 00:04:54.195]  you become part of it.
[00:04:54.195 --> 00:04:57.216]  That's just common sense logic.
[00:04:57.216 --> 00:04:59.736]  They are the ones that are guilty, the people like media matters.
[00:05:27.216 --> 00:05:31.296]  People do not forget how hard Trump hit Saudi Arabia on the campaign trail, ridiculing them
[00:05:31.296 --> 00:05:35.775]  for their treatment of women and homosexuals and criticizing Hillary Clinton for taking
[00:05:35.775 --> 00:05:36.775]  money from them.
[00:05:36.775 --> 00:05:40.895]  But President Trump did step on the floor of the Arab Islamic America Summit in Riyadh
[00:05:40.895 --> 00:05:45.176]  and call out radical Islamic terrorism, saying their lives would be brief.
[00:05:45.176 --> 00:05:49.236]  Also worth consideration is the stock market jolt the arms deal gave Wall Street, especially
[00:05:49.236 --> 00:05:51.015]  Lockheed Martin and Raytheon.
[00:05:51.015 --> 00:05:55.056]  Meanwhile, back in America, the Democrats are trying to impeach Trump, crying foreign
[00:05:55.056 --> 00:05:57.716]  collusion, but are silent on this arms deal.
[00:05:57.716 --> 00:06:00.256]  They must be shareholders for info wars dot com.
[00:06:00.256 --> 00:06:01.256]  This is Owen Schroyer.
[00:06:01.256 --> 00:06:04.816]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own
[00:06:04.816 --> 00:06:09.916]  four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through
[00:06:09.916 --> 00:06:11.936]  Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[00:06:11.936 --> 00:06:16.816]  That's why I'm introducing Z shield, toxic metal and chemical defense support.
[00:06:16.816 --> 00:06:18.336]  It's made in the USA.
[00:06:18.336 --> 00:06:23.256]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying
[00:06:23.256 --> 00:06:24.256]  the body.
[00:06:24.256 --> 00:06:25.256]  And it supports the info war.
[00:06:25.256 --> 00:06:30.296]  It is a classical 360 when this is the formula that I personally have been taking for over
[00:06:30.296 --> 00:06:31.296]  a year.
[00:06:31.296 --> 00:06:35.696]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier
[00:06:35.696 --> 00:06:40.696]  as you can possibly get yourself, your family, and you owe it to the future of this
[00:06:40.696 --> 00:06:45.536]  country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as
[00:06:45.536 --> 00:06:50.976]  you can be, because we need you the remnant of America to reignite those brushfires the
[00:06:50.976 --> 00:06:54.816]  next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be thanks to your support and your
[00:06:54.816 --> 00:06:55.976]  prayers together.
[00:06:55.976 --> 00:06:56.976]  We're changing the world.
[00:06:56.976 --> 00:06:57.976]  Now.
[00:06:57.976 --> 00:07:01.015]  It's time to change our bodies with Z field in full words, life.com.
[00:07:01.015 --> 00:07:02.015]  Embrich's essentials.
[00:07:02.015 --> 00:07:03.015]  That's my middle name.
[00:07:03.015 --> 00:07:09.135]  I've spent seven years off and on trying to get a big national brand that's already
[00:07:09.135 --> 00:07:13.976]  trusted to let us private label an entire line of personal care products.
[00:07:13.976 --> 00:07:14.976]  That's organic.
[00:07:14.976 --> 00:07:15.976]  My quality.
[00:07:15.976 --> 00:07:21.696]  We are one of the top three selling organic brands in the country that puts out high quality
[00:07:21.696 --> 00:07:25.895]  organic shampoo, mouthwash, you name it, and there's such Patriots.
[00:07:25.895 --> 00:07:29.135]  They have led us basically keep their well-known packaging.
[00:07:29.135 --> 00:07:30.135]  It is an answer to prayers.
[00:07:30.135 --> 00:07:34.096]  And because we're cutting out the middleman 20% off retail sign up for auto ship an
[00:07:34.096 --> 00:07:36.316]  additional 25% off.
[00:07:36.316 --> 00:07:37.416]  It's all there.
[00:07:37.416 --> 00:07:42.856]  The body wash, the shampoo, the deodorant, the mouthwash, all of it is truly game changing.
[00:07:42.856 --> 00:07:44.775]  It is the exact same product.
[00:07:44.775 --> 00:07:47.096]  Just the name is different Emmerich's essentials.
[00:07:47.096 --> 00:07:50.856]  And it's on average 20% off what it would be in stores.
[00:07:50.856 --> 00:07:53.736]  Buying it directly from info or store.com.
[00:07:53.736 --> 00:07:54.736]  Help us win the info war.
[00:07:54.736 --> 00:07:55.736]  We'll get products.
[00:07:55.736 --> 00:07:59.816]  Everybody needs info wars, life.com, where you'll find the entire line of Emmerich's
[00:07:59.816 --> 00:08:04.655]  essentials.
[00:08:04.655 --> 00:08:19.936]  Well, the leftists are blaming the right wing show because there is a war on your mind.
[00:08:19.936 --> 00:08:23.856]  That's the headline with the tweets and the news article headlines at info wars.com
[00:08:23.856 --> 00:08:31.696]  Leftists bemoan Islamophobia, backlash on social media, following Manchester terrorist
[00:08:31.696 --> 00:08:36.436]  attack and basically blamed Christians for stirring up the Muslims.
[00:08:36.436 --> 00:08:38.256]  We need to submit to their religion.
[00:08:38.256 --> 00:08:40.176]  We need to put our women in a jobs.
[00:08:40.176 --> 00:08:45.136]  We need to have the feminist groups go out and scream Allah Akbar in the town squares
[00:08:45.136 --> 00:08:47.256]  all over the United States and all over Europe.
[00:08:47.256 --> 00:08:52.036]  And that will make the Islamists to stop attacking us all over the news.
[00:08:52.036 --> 00:08:59.676]  They're asking who is the accomplice to the reported bomber that CBS News and Drudge Report
[00:08:59.676 --> 00:09:02.636]  and others are now reporting, Salman Abadi.
[00:09:02.636 --> 00:09:03.915]  Who are the accomplices?
[00:09:03.915 --> 00:09:04.915]  Let me tell you.
[00:09:04.915 --> 00:09:14.316]  The Democratic Party, the Labour Party of the UK, Merkel's party in Germany.
[00:09:14.316 --> 00:09:19.456]  People like Macron that says Islamic attacks are now part of life, just accept it.
[00:09:19.456 --> 00:09:23.656]  And the riots and the rapes and the car attacks and the stabbings and the shootings
[00:09:23.656 --> 00:09:26.096]  and the no go zones everywhere.
[00:09:26.096 --> 00:09:30.876]  And the mayor of London declaring it London Stan.
[00:09:30.876 --> 00:09:35.616]  And saying that it's now part of life, just accept terror.
[00:09:35.616 --> 00:09:39.576]  It's never called Islamist.
[00:09:39.576 --> 00:09:40.576]  That's who's aiding and abetting.
[00:09:40.576 --> 00:09:42.216]  They keep saying, who was helping him?
[00:09:42.216 --> 00:09:43.876]  How did he do it?
[00:09:43.876 --> 00:09:49.336]  They brought back thousands and thousands, just 1600 the last few months have come
[00:09:49.415 --> 00:09:55.016]  back into Europe and back into the UK who were actual ISIS fighters and who were on
[00:09:55.016 --> 00:09:57.336]  a watch list.
[00:09:57.336 --> 00:10:03.376]  There are more than 4000 total on ISIS watch lists just in the UK alone and thousands
[00:10:03.376 --> 00:10:07.736]  more a month coming into Europe that Interpol allows in.
[00:10:07.736 --> 00:10:09.616]  They know they're ISIS fighters.
[00:10:09.616 --> 00:10:10.976]  They know they're Al-Qaeda.
[00:10:10.976 --> 00:10:16.976]  They know they're Wahhabist and they let them back in to the countries.
[00:10:17.896 --> 00:10:20.096]  So you ask who's behind this?
[00:10:20.096 --> 00:10:24.896]  The UN, the globalists, the refugee programs, George Soros pushing it.
[00:10:24.896 --> 00:10:30.295]  The UN certifies it's safe to bring them in, does no background checks, lets in known
[00:10:30.295 --> 00:10:33.936]  ISIS fighters, orders our State Department to let them in.
[00:10:33.936 --> 00:10:35.536]  That's what we live under.
[00:10:35.536 --> 00:10:40.876]  And it's the same thing in the UK where the EU orders the UK on who to let in.
[00:10:40.915 --> 00:10:49.636]  And if the UK doesn't let in ISIS fighters, they're fined up to £100,000 for refusing entry.
[00:10:49.636 --> 00:10:51.876]  And they're talking about charging more.
[00:10:51.876 --> 00:10:53.795]  They're talking about a million euros.
[00:10:53.795 --> 00:10:57.396]  Just type it into Google if you don't accept that.
[00:10:59.236 --> 00:11:02.956]  And so, ladies and gentlemen, I'm sure many of the parents of the young people that
[00:11:02.956 --> 00:11:06.436]  were at this concert, many were adults, many were tweenies, many were teens.
[00:11:06.436 --> 00:11:10.356]  Most adults probably there don't like having open borders to Islam.
[00:11:10.396 --> 00:11:14.795]  But I guarantee a lot of the parents do want to go along with bringing in radical Islam.
[00:11:16.356 --> 00:11:23.795]  And bottom line, they are now responsible for this animal bombing and killing 22 plus people.
[00:11:23.795 --> 00:11:28.996]  The parents that call for open borders and call for appeasement are just as guilty
[00:11:28.996 --> 00:11:34.076]  as Macron and Merkel and Hillary Clinton and Obama and all the rest of them.
[00:11:34.076 --> 00:11:37.716]  You're the ones that have these dead children's blood on your hands.
[00:11:37.716 --> 00:11:39.476]  You're the trendies that love this.
[00:11:39.516 --> 00:11:44.316]  I was at the mall yesterday with my children, and many of the shops I walked by like Gap,
[00:11:44.316 --> 00:11:47.396]  we have some footage we can roll in a minute, show women and
[00:11:47.396 --> 00:11:50.236]  hajibs on their front billboards.
[00:11:50.236 --> 00:11:53.516]  The number one thing they're promoting is women and hajibs.
[00:11:55.476 --> 00:11:58.116]  It is absolutely being force fed to us.
[00:11:58.116 --> 00:12:03.356]  Just a few months ago at the inauguration, I saw them handing out thousands of
[00:12:03.356 --> 00:12:06.516]  American flag hajibs to women, and I couldn't believe it.
[00:12:06.516 --> 00:12:11.076]  And it turned out it was officially run by Muslims, and George Soros funded it.
[00:12:11.076 --> 00:12:14.196]  And then it was an induction into Islam.
[00:12:14.196 --> 00:12:17.956]  And then we see it all over the news, USA Today, you name it, women wearing
[00:12:17.956 --> 00:12:23.396]  the hajib, even if they're not Muslims, to stand against Trump.
[00:12:25.236 --> 00:12:27.836]  You just had the truck attack killing a bunch of people in Stockholm, Sweden.
[00:12:27.836 --> 00:12:30.036]  They wouldn't show the dead and dying people.
[00:12:30.036 --> 00:12:32.236]  They don't want to show you the dead teenagers and
[00:12:32.236 --> 00:12:34.916]  dead young people up close from Manchester,
[00:12:34.916 --> 00:12:36.396]  close to where Paul Watson's from.
[00:12:36.396 --> 00:12:40.596]  And then they have the nerve at Media Matters,
[00:12:40.596 --> 00:12:44.076]  openly funded by George Soros, the Nazi collaborator, to come out and
[00:12:44.076 --> 00:12:47.596]  say, Alex Jones blames the victims.
[00:12:47.596 --> 00:12:49.076]  And then they have their own people quoted and
[00:12:49.076 --> 00:12:51.676]  they're saying, kill me, shoot me, murder me.
[00:12:51.676 --> 00:12:54.156]  Well, I guess your Islamicist will probably try.
[00:12:54.156 --> 00:12:59.316]  But what I actually said was, upwards of half the population in Britain in
[00:12:59.316 --> 00:13:02.476]  polls, or more, want open borders and Muslims to be brought in.
[00:13:03.476 --> 00:13:07.516]  And so these are the people that are guilty of this.
[00:13:07.516 --> 00:13:11.516]  And you are guilty, if you promoted this, of aiding and
[00:13:11.516 --> 00:13:15.956]  abetting people that just went like cowards and bombed a bunch of innocent children.
[00:13:16.258 --> 00:13:23.458]  But see, an upside down bizarro world, you have to invert it and say conservatives and
[00:13:23.458 --> 00:13:29.778]  libertarians and nationalists and just common sense people, we made the Muslims bad, we
[00:13:29.778 --> 00:13:34.538]  made them attack us, we have to appease them, we have to bow down to them, we have to go
[00:13:34.538 --> 00:13:38.098]  along with them better, and then everything would have been okay.
[00:13:38.098 --> 00:13:41.698]  Paul Joseph Watson joins us from London, England.
[00:13:41.698 --> 00:13:47.358]  We are then joined, ladies and gentlemen, at the bottom of the hour by some of the other
[00:13:47.358 --> 00:13:52.338]  witnesses to what happened from the UK as well.
[00:13:52.338 --> 00:13:57.958]  Paul Watson will then be hosting the fourth hour.
[00:13:57.958 --> 00:14:01.878]  And we have Tommy Robinson again, who's one of the front lines of exposing this.
[00:14:01.878 --> 00:14:04.198]  He'll be joining us coming up in about 20 minutes.
[00:14:04.198 --> 00:14:08.198]  But Paul Watson joins us right now and I'm going to play the clips of the mayor of
[00:14:08.198 --> 00:14:10.978]  London saying just get used to it.
[00:14:10.978 --> 00:14:12.418]  Get used to it, baby.
[00:14:12.418 --> 00:14:14.698]  You're going to get cucked and cocked hard.
[00:14:14.698 --> 00:14:15.698]  And it's not his fault, though.
[00:14:15.698 --> 00:14:16.698]  It's my fault.
[00:14:16.698 --> 00:14:19.098]  Media Matters doesn't say he shows any blame.
[00:14:19.098 --> 00:14:20.098]  It's me.
[00:14:20.098 --> 00:14:24.098]  George Soros, the Nazi collaborator, says it's my fault.
[00:14:24.098 --> 00:14:26.858]  It's your fault because you didn't bring in enough Muslims.
[00:14:26.858 --> 00:14:28.858]  You didn't cut enough genitals off women.
[00:14:28.858 --> 00:14:30.618]  You didn't put enough headdresses on them.
[00:14:30.618 --> 00:14:31.818]  You didn't bow down enough.
[00:14:31.818 --> 00:14:33.458]  You didn't give in enough.
[00:14:33.458 --> 00:14:34.818]  You didn't submit enough.
[00:14:34.902 --> 00:14:41.542]  You read the media matters, it's like I'm sick of Christians, we got a Christian problem.
[00:14:41.542 --> 00:14:45.342]  In the comments we're going to get this Christian Jones, like I bet it's Muslims in there saying
[00:14:45.342 --> 00:14:50.942]  kill me, and that we want to kill Jones, yeah let's kill him, yeah we're liberal, let's
[00:14:50.942 --> 00:14:54.822]  kill him, it's his fault the Muslims killed people, it's Christians though, they're the
[00:14:54.822 --> 00:14:55.822]  bad ones.
[00:14:55.822 --> 00:15:01.702]  Well don't worry, what's left of a Christian culture just got bombed yesterday.
[00:15:01.702 --> 00:15:05.222]  But you're in a group of foaming at the mouth mental patients.
[00:15:05.222 --> 00:15:08.782]  We have a real problem in this country and around the world, and I'm not afraid to call
[00:15:08.782 --> 00:15:10.982]  it by the name, radical Christian extremism.
[00:15:10.982 --> 00:15:18.062]  Well let me give you statistics from your own UN bud, there at Media Matters.
[00:15:18.062 --> 00:15:21.182]  Christians are the number one persecuted group in the world, doubling everybody else,
[00:15:21.182 --> 00:15:25.182]  and that amount of attacks on Christians has doubled in the last decade, it's growing
[00:15:25.182 --> 00:15:26.182]  exponentially.
[00:15:26.182 --> 00:15:28.422]  And that's what Trump talked about now.
[00:15:28.422 --> 00:15:31.622]  Let's go to Paul Joseph Watson from London, England.
[00:15:31.622 --> 00:15:38.322]  To break this down we have 22 dead, more than 50 injured, and the media is saying
[00:15:38.322 --> 00:15:39.422]  why'd this happen?
[00:15:39.422 --> 00:15:42.582]  It's completely out of the blue, they tried to cover it up as an Islamic attack
[00:15:42.582 --> 00:15:47.622]  for 24 hours, it failed, now the government of the UK has come out and said it is Islamic,
[00:15:47.622 --> 00:15:55.942]  the pitiful, slimy, disgusting, cowardly, out of control, ISIS people have taken
[00:15:55.942 --> 00:15:58.702]  credit, and the answer is bring more Islamists in.
[00:15:58.702 --> 00:16:03.302]  And I'll say this, I don't blame all the police, but the ones on top in the bureaucracy
[00:16:03.302 --> 00:16:06.902]  and the security services that just use these attacks to get more power, but never
[00:16:06.902 --> 00:16:12.062]  stop the jihadis Paul, they're to blame as well, Paul who's to blame for this?
[00:16:12.062 --> 00:16:18.902]  Alex, the people to blame are the political class who have ranked in matter of importance,
[00:16:18.902 --> 00:16:24.562]  tolerance above the basic function of government, which is protecting the lives of its people.
[00:16:24.562 --> 00:16:30.842]  They think it's now more important to rank tolerance above that, what is tolerance?
[00:16:30.842 --> 00:16:34.842]  Tolerance of Muslim rape gangs that abduct young girls and abuse them for years and
[00:16:34.842 --> 00:16:40.122]  years and years, and the authorities don't do anything about it because it's politically
[00:16:40.122 --> 00:16:41.922]  incorrect.
[00:16:41.922 --> 00:16:45.902]  That's tolerance, tolerance of Sharia law, tolerance of women being abused and harassed
[00:16:45.902 --> 00:16:50.522]  on the street, tolerance is now more important than the basic right to life.
[00:16:50.522 --> 00:16:55.542]  When you were talking about political correctness before, Alex, you know with the San Bernardino
[00:16:55.542 --> 00:17:00.362]  killings, we saw the neighbors were getting suspicious, they were taken in these suspicious
[00:17:00.362 --> 00:17:04.242]  parcels before the attacks, they were meeting with suspicious people.
[00:17:04.242 --> 00:17:08.862]  There was an incident right before this bombing last night in Manchester, and an eyewitness
[00:17:08.862 --> 00:17:10.602]  has come out and talked about it.
[00:17:10.602 --> 00:17:15.322]  She saw what was obviously, although she didn't say it directly, a foreign individual,
[00:17:15.322 --> 00:17:19.582]  probably a Muslim individual, looking nervous, looking suspicious, fidgeting with something
[00:17:19.582 --> 00:17:25.502]  in her bag, looking back to the area where the bomb went off, she reported this woman,
[00:17:25.502 --> 00:17:30.562]  it looked like it was possibly one of the accomplices, she reported her to the security,
[00:17:30.562 --> 00:17:32.342]  what did the security say?
[00:17:32.342 --> 00:17:36.462]  They said to the woman who was trying to report the suspicious activity, how would
[00:17:36.462 --> 00:17:40.282]  you like it if somebody said that you were being suspicious?
[00:17:40.282 --> 00:17:43.882]  So it was obviously, by the way, she was describing it because she said she couldn't
[00:17:43.882 --> 00:17:49.502]  speak English very well, it was obviously possibly some kind of accomplice to this attack
[00:17:49.542 --> 00:17:53.822]  the security did nothing about it, they didn't kick her out, they didn't even talk to her,
[00:17:53.822 --> 00:17:57.482]  they just left her alone, so it looks like that could have happened again, again that's
[00:17:57.482 --> 00:18:01.822]  not confirmed, but in the aftermath of this Alex, what do we see again?
[00:18:01.822 --> 00:18:09.982]  Liberals, leftists, more outraged about offensive tweets than mangled dead kids, than kids
[00:18:09.982 --> 00:18:14.122]  with body parts missing, that's what they're more offended about.
[00:18:14.162 --> 00:18:20.042]  The Met police in London has come out and said they're investigating, not the ISIS terrorists,
[00:18:20.042 --> 00:18:23.762]  the hundreds of ISIS terrorists running around the country who have been let back in, no,
[00:18:23.762 --> 00:18:29.282]  no, no, no, they're investigating Katie Hopkins because she said something offensive on Twitter,
[00:18:29.282 --> 00:18:32.982]  they're actually doing this, this is what she said on Twitter, Western men, these
[00:18:32.982 --> 00:18:37.122]  are your wives, your daughters, your sons, stand up, rise up, demand action, do not
[00:18:37.122 --> 00:18:43.442]  carry on as normal, that is hate speech and is now being investigated by the Metropolitan
[00:18:43.442 --> 00:18:48.522]  Police after it was reported to them by offended leftists on Twitter.
[00:18:48.522 --> 00:18:51.962]  That's right, and Tommy Robinson's joining us, he's the guy that first reported over
[00:18:51.962 --> 00:18:56.082]  a decade ago, they were kidnapping and grooming young girls, now it's come out in dozens
[00:18:56.082 --> 00:19:00.962]  and dozens of towns, thousands per town, sex slavery, killing the young girls, and
[00:19:00.962 --> 00:19:04.962]  the police will do nothing because it's politically incorrect to talk bad about a bunch of
[00:19:04.962 --> 00:19:09.042]  men with big beards grabbing 10 year old girls from the bus stops, I mean this
[00:19:09.042 --> 00:19:17.002]  is just so over the top, the mass Stockholm syndrome that we're witnessing here, Paul.
[00:19:17.002 --> 00:19:21.782]  And it's Stockholm syndrome on steroids, the Independent came out with a headline this
[00:19:21.782 --> 00:19:26.882]  morning, quote, there's only one way Britain should respond to attacks such as Manchester,
[00:19:26.882 --> 00:19:33.042]  that is by carrying on exactly as before, just carry on, just forget about it, just
[00:19:33.042 --> 00:19:37.522]  wait until it happens again and again and again and again, Alex, how do the parents
[00:19:37.522 --> 00:19:41.122]  of dead kids just carry on exactly as before?
[00:19:41.122 --> 00:19:47.202]  How do the teenage girls who have been dismembered, how are they going to carry on with life
[00:19:47.202 --> 00:19:48.642]  just as it was before?
[00:19:48.642 --> 00:19:53.762]  No, that's not bravery to just carry on like nothing's happening, that's frigging
[00:19:53.762 --> 00:19:54.762]  cowardice.
[00:19:54.762 --> 00:19:59.842]  But it seems, Alex, we've made a choice as a society, again, our leaders place hurt
[00:19:59.842 --> 00:20:05.282]  feelings, they rank that as being more important than the actual basic survival and safety
[00:20:05.282 --> 00:20:06.282]  of their citizens.
[00:20:06.282 --> 00:20:10.882]  Sure, this is trauma-based mind control, they know these attacks are coming, they know
[00:20:10.882 --> 00:20:15.122]  that the trendies are being targeted, they know the helpless population has been domesticated
[00:20:15.122 --> 00:20:20.122]  into this position and they are testing to just see what you'll put up with, what
[00:20:20.122 --> 00:20:24.882]  you'll go along with, I mean first it's have taxpayers pay for sex changes, then
[00:20:24.882 --> 00:20:28.402]  it's oh, it's bad if you have a mother or father or if you're male or female, now
[00:20:28.402 --> 00:20:33.282]  having a sex is bad, now having your own identity is bad unless it's a liberal trendy
[00:20:33.282 --> 00:20:37.682]  identity because this isn't liberal or trendy, this is an assault on the west, they'll
[00:20:37.682 --> 00:20:42.142]  use Islam, they'll use pedophile groups, they'll use anybody they can to scramble
[00:20:42.142 --> 00:20:48.242]  civilization to make us so confused with learned helplessness that we will then submit.
[00:20:48.242 --> 00:20:52.322]  I want to play this clip, this is so surreal, this was happening as the bombs had
[00:20:52.322 --> 00:20:57.602]  just gone off, they're now saying probably two bombs, a coordinated effort, but again
[00:20:57.602 --> 00:20:58.602]  who's behind it?
[00:20:58.602 --> 00:20:59.602]  Who helped them?
[00:20:59.602 --> 00:21:00.602]  Who helped them?
[00:21:00.602 --> 00:21:01.602]  Who protected them?
[00:21:01.602 --> 00:21:02.602]  The liberals.
[00:21:02.602 --> 00:21:03.602]  Who went along with it?
[00:21:03.602 --> 00:21:04.602]  The trendies.
[00:21:04.602 --> 00:21:06.482]  Who helped import these groups?
[00:21:06.482 --> 00:21:09.202]  Who backed ISIS and Al-Qaeda in the Arab Spring?
[00:21:09.202 --> 00:21:14.722]  European and the US government, the globalists are allied with radical Islam, Manchester
[00:21:14.722 --> 00:21:20.722]  arena terror attack, no problems here message, this is Sky News announcer tries to calm
[00:21:20.722 --> 00:21:26.962]  the crowd, just gets a sky event, exiting the arena, but goes a little too far,
[00:21:26.962 --> 00:21:32.222]  a little too far, it's like drink your Kool-Aid, everything's fine, you'll be in heaven soon,
[00:21:32.222 --> 00:21:37.322]  goes a little too far by claiming preemptively that there are no problems here and quote
[00:21:37.322 --> 00:21:43.082]  we're glad you came out and had a good time tonight as if he were oblivious to
[00:21:43.082 --> 00:21:46.562]  the fact that someone just blew themselves up.
[00:21:46.562 --> 00:21:54.682]  So he's there announcing there at the Ariana Grande concert, Ariana Grande, it's so fun
[00:21:54.682 --> 00:21:58.882]  and nothing bad happened here tonight, nothing went on, you had a great evening, your steak
[00:21:58.882 --> 00:22:04.302]  was perfect, like they say at restaurants, your wine was perfect, your suicide bomb
[00:22:04.302 --> 00:22:10.482]  and flesh and guts and blood of teenagers was wonderful, you had a fabulous evening.
[00:22:10.482 --> 00:22:13.942]  People say oh this is Stockholm syndrome, this is mind control, this is Jim Jones
[00:22:13.942 --> 00:22:19.122]  Kool-Aid drills, it is, this is just one step more extreme of the media saying
[00:22:19.122 --> 00:22:24.002]  move along, no big deal, the answer is bring in more Muslims, have our young girls
[00:22:24.042 --> 00:22:28.482]  we're hajibs, that will make the Muslims not kill us, let's submit to them, let's
[00:22:28.482 --> 00:22:32.642]  let them bully us, let's roll over, you know when we bring in folks from some
[00:22:32.642 --> 00:22:37.722]  areas in the Middle East that are 5,000 times plus more often to have
[00:22:37.722 --> 00:22:42.002]  birth defects or brain disorders from inbreeding, let's bring in a bunch of
[00:22:42.002 --> 00:22:45.882]  inbred insane people and let them murder and kill us and kidnap our
[00:22:45.882 --> 00:22:49.122]  children and do everything because it's liberal and it's the right thing to
[00:22:49.122 --> 00:22:53.242]  do, let's let the big brain bug Muslims bring in all of the little
[00:22:53.242 --> 00:22:57.842]  subgroups they're controlling and then own factories and facilities and have
[00:22:57.842 --> 00:23:02.542]  their little elves, brain damaged inbred elves in there working in their
[00:23:02.542 --> 00:23:07.922]  basically slave factories, I mean this is an absolute total takeover and our
[00:23:07.922 --> 00:23:12.802]  elites are out to get us, here is the mind control right after the bombing
[00:23:12.802 --> 00:23:14.802]  telling folks they all had a great evening.
[00:23:23.242 --> 00:23:29.242]  There's no need to punch up, there's no problems here, just take your time and keep exiting the building.
[00:23:29.242 --> 00:23:34.242]  There's no need to punch up and run, take your time, there's no problems here.
[00:23:34.242 --> 00:23:41.242]  Thank you for coming and having a good time tonight, everything is fine, just take your time, exit the building.
[00:23:41.242 --> 00:23:43.242]  Thank you very much.
[00:23:43.242 --> 00:23:45.242]  Thanks for bringing your kids to the event.
[00:23:46.242 --> 00:23:49.242]  And no one's going to try to stop the Muslims coming in and blowing you up
[00:23:49.242 --> 00:23:52.242]  and some will argue well they don't want rioting, they don't want people
[00:23:52.242 --> 00:23:56.742]  stampeding and dying, you don't have to lie to them, you just say please move
[00:23:56.742 --> 00:24:02.682]  orderly to the exits, it appears the event is over, whatever but see the
[00:24:02.682 --> 00:24:05.922]  government's bringing in the Muslims, it's bringing in the unvented Muslims, it's
[00:24:05.922 --> 00:24:09.402]  bringing in the thousands of jihadis knowing this is going to happen, it's
[00:24:09.402 --> 00:24:12.402]  not like the media saying be calm, everything's gonna be okay, we're gonna fix
[00:24:12.402 --> 00:24:15.802]  this problem, we're gonna deport these people, no no they're just saying be
[00:24:15.802 --> 00:24:20.242]  calm, everything's fine, drink the Kool-Aid, you're gonna be in heaven, Paul Watson.
[00:24:20.242 --> 00:24:25.202]  Well Alex the point is they're not just letting them in and I'm gonna do a big
[00:24:25.202 --> 00:24:30.482]  video expose about this as well, the NGO boats, this is all George Soros funded
[00:24:30.482 --> 00:24:34.962]  and I'm gonna name the organisations by name, they're going out like a taxi
[00:24:34.962 --> 00:24:39.962]  service to 12 miles off the coast of Libya from Italy, picking up these
[00:24:39.962 --> 00:24:45.362]  migrants, bringing them back to Italy, half of them just go missing while ISIS
[00:24:45.362 --> 00:24:50.642]  is literally paying their fee to pay the people smugglers if they join ISIS.
[00:24:50.642 --> 00:24:55.242]  And ISIS said, ISIS said three years ago quote we're gonna have a migrant
[00:24:55.242 --> 00:24:59.562]  flood to flood you with our jihadists and bring Europe down, the UN says yes,
[00:24:59.562 --> 00:25:03.522]  opens it up, advertises it, it's a master plan Paul, they've admitted it,
[00:25:03.522 --> 00:25:07.642]  what is the master plan bringing in the sleeper cell army of five million
[00:25:07.642 --> 00:25:11.762]  plus people, 80% military-aged men, what are they planning?
[00:25:12.202 --> 00:25:16.922]  Well on a purely selfish level again the elite, the political elite, they don't have to live
[00:25:16.922 --> 00:25:21.362]  amongst this, they get private chauffeurs to every single event, they live in their ivory
[00:25:21.362 --> 00:25:25.202]  towers, they don't have to use public transport, they don't have to use commercial
[00:25:25.202 --> 00:25:30.081]  airlines, you know, they're protected from this, we're not, so they don't really have to live
[00:25:30.081 --> 00:25:35.162]  in the chaos that they create, of course politically bringing in huge numbers of people,
[00:25:35.162 --> 00:25:40.562]  you can do a map where in Britain you compare the areas where the Muslim ghettos are
[00:25:40.562 --> 00:25:45.602]  versus who they vote for, it's always left-wing political parties who will give them welfare
[00:25:45.602 --> 00:25:51.642]  and benefits, same in any other European country, so that's the motive, they want huge voting
[00:25:51.642 --> 00:25:56.482]  blocs, they want to literally destroy society, they don't value or cherish Western
[00:25:56.482 --> 00:26:01.842]  values anymore, they've replaced them with this horrific tolerance idea which is clearly
[00:26:01.842 --> 00:26:05.362]  not working for us but they don't care because they're in their ivory towers.
[00:26:05.362 --> 00:26:12.602]  But this suicide bomber Alex, Libyan refugee parents, was born in Manchester, so we gave
[00:26:12.602 --> 00:26:18.962]  his parents refuge in the United Kingdom, they gave us a suicide bomber, oh but this guy was
[00:26:18.962 --> 00:26:25.162]  born here, so Alex he's one of the integrated ones, he's another example of how multiculturalism
[00:26:25.162 --> 00:26:32.642]  has worked so well, born in this country, blows himself up along with 22, 23 other people,
[00:26:32.642 --> 00:26:38.402]  but don't worry Alex because CNN's Jake Tapper tweeted out an image of the Union Jack,
[00:26:38.402 --> 00:26:44.042]  so everything's going to be okay now, that's what annoys me the most is the concern signaling.
[00:26:44.042 --> 00:26:48.602]  Well that's what they do, exactly virtue signaling, they push for the end of the
[00:26:48.602 --> 00:26:54.122]  Union Jack, they try to say don't fly it, it's racist, first they you know ban what
[00:26:54.122 --> 00:26:58.802]  the King George flag and a bunch of others and so then they move on but then when there's
[00:26:58.802 --> 00:27:03.242]  a tragic event, oh here's your flag, while the globalists are busy killing the culture,
[00:27:03.242 --> 00:27:10.122]  killing the identity, but then they kind of give you as a body bag, a Union Jack colored body bag.
[00:27:10.122 --> 00:27:15.322]  Notice though Alex, he didn't tweet out a Russian flag last month when all those people got
[00:27:15.322 --> 00:27:21.122]  massacred in the St. Petersburg subway, did he? Oh no, it's selective outrage, also again,
[00:27:21.122 --> 00:27:27.202]  not all Muslims, the main concern immediately after 22 people, mostly teenage girls,
[00:27:27.202 --> 00:27:31.602]  have been slaughtered and dismembered, is not what do we do to stop this from happening
[00:27:31.602 --> 00:27:37.482]  over and over again, it's oh no, somebody might be mean to Muslims, don't be an Islamophobe,
[00:27:37.482 --> 00:27:41.602]  that's the main concern, no it's not the main concern, it shouldn't be.
[00:27:41.602 --> 00:27:46.562]  And by the way, when Dylann Roof went in, when scumbag Dylann Roof went in and shot,
[00:27:46.562 --> 00:27:52.042]  you know, nine poor black people because he was a brainwashed idiot, the media for months,
[00:27:52.042 --> 00:27:55.002]  it was the end of the world, America's evil, all conservatives are racist,
[00:27:55.042 --> 00:27:59.482]  all whites are racist, you've got a brown Muslim guy going and blowing up mainly a
[00:27:59.482 --> 00:28:03.362]  bunch of little white girls, are folks going to call this racial? Because a big component
[00:28:03.362 --> 00:28:07.522]  of Islam is anti-white, anti-West, let's just get that out there.
[00:28:07.522 --> 00:28:14.402]  Well here's a tweet, Alex, and it exemplifies this, says, and this list will have got like
[00:28:14.402 --> 00:28:20.202]  50-60,000 retweets, Muslims are to blame when in reality Muslim taxi drivers are offering
[00:28:20.202 --> 00:28:25.402]  free lifts, okay, so because some Muslim taxi drivers are offering free rides,
[00:28:25.402 --> 00:28:30.081]  that means there's not a problem with Islam and violence, no it doesn't work like that,
[00:28:30.081 --> 00:28:34.922]  but that is the level of idiocy we're dealing with, that is literally the most
[00:28:34.922 --> 00:28:40.562]  tweeted thing today on Twitter, that's what we're dealing with, again, empty platitudes.
[00:28:40.562 --> 00:28:44.002]  Really, you know what's funny, the last few times I was in the UK, it was almost all
[00:28:44.002 --> 00:28:49.002]  Muslim taxi drivers, they would shake me down for double the rate to take me to my hotel,
[00:28:49.122 --> 00:28:53.562]  laughing at me until I would run into a British taxi driver, and they would let me in and
[00:28:53.562 --> 00:28:57.482]  actually only charge me the regular rate, and apologize to me, and say, you know, this
[00:28:57.482 --> 00:28:59.802]  is London Stan now, mate.
[00:28:59.802 --> 00:29:06.802]  Yeah, but it's, again, look at the stats, okay, it's not a tiny fringe, 34% of British
[00:29:07.002 --> 00:29:12.202]  Muslims say they would not inform police if they knew someone was getting involved
[00:29:12.202 --> 00:29:18.802]  with ISIS, 34%, sorry, only 34% would inform, so in fact the vast majority of British
[00:29:18.802 --> 00:29:24.842]  Muslims would not tell police if someone they knew was joining ISIS, we saw the same
[00:29:24.842 --> 00:29:26.442]  thing in Belgium after Paris.
[00:29:26.442 --> 00:29:30.162]  But it's not the Muslim's fault, it's conservatives, nationalists, libertarians,
[00:29:30.162 --> 00:29:35.122]  and it's my fault, Paul, media matters is saying it's my fault, I'm a bad fact,
[00:29:35.122 --> 00:29:39.642]  I don't like the children that died, total lie, I'm saying the trendies in the UK that
[00:29:39.642 --> 00:29:43.682]  say open the borders up, bring this in, they're to blame, and you know that stadium
[00:29:43.682 --> 00:29:47.962]  had adults and others that were in it that totally are cuckold and are pushing for this,
[00:29:48.002 --> 00:29:53.722]  the left has to embrace it, you love Islam, you love sexual mutilation, you love hajibs,
[00:29:53.722 --> 00:30:00.722]  Paul Watson, be safe, Tommy Robinson from the UK as well coming up, stay with us.
[00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:40.320]  ...into the world to see how weak we have become. I look now, I'm 20 miles from a town called
[00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:45.080]  Rochdale where there's been a program where an entire generation of youth were gang raped
[00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:49.920]  and tortured by Muslim men. Those Muslim men are now out of prison after less than three
[00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:54.160]  or four years and they're walking around the town of Rochdale where the girls are
[00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:59.400]  that they rape. What has happened to us as a race? What has happened to us as a country
[00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:06.040]  that we're allowing this such systematic abuse of our people. We're allowing now a concert
[00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:11.080]  now where our daughters are being massacred and maimed and this is all being facilitated
[00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:16.200]  and no one is doing anything. So again, I can't answer your question, Alex, because
[00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:21.120]  I ask myself every time when Lee Rigby was beheaded I said, this has to be it. When
[00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:24.280]  this happened earlier and I'm watching it and I'm seeing daughters and young girls
[00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:30.920]  and eight-year-old gold is gone, 22 young British people are dead. What is it going to take?
[00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:36.520]  What is it going to take? We've got the same response. There's a peace vigil in
[00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:39.840]  half hour, a peace vigil. What is that peace vigil going to do?
[00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:44.840]  All the peace vigil is, is a giant white flag begging these folks to kill more. And
[00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:49.520]  notice when we're trying to take out non-radical Islam groups in Syria and they have this clear
[00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:53.280]  fake false flag chemical attack, they've been caught doing it before, they show the kids
[00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:58.280]  gulping and dying for air. But every time there's a suicide truck or a shooting or a bombing,
[00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:02.500]  they blur out the people, they won't show the dead girls, they won't show the dead bodies.
[00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:07.200]  It's going to take showing on the news, the Islamists is taking credit, bragging
[00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:10.040]  how they're going to kill your sons and daughters, bragging how they're going to kill
[00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:13.720]  your police, bragging how they're going to do all this and then showing the dead
[00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:19.100]  girls or dying girls flopping around with their guts hanging out, begging for mommy.
[00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:21.740]  What's going to take showing that?
[00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:27.860]  What did the back in the back where people's genitals were cut off and fed to them, where
[00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:33.660]  young girls were raped with knives, they were raped with knives, they were tortured.
[00:43:33.660 --> 00:43:38.660]  That changed nothing in front. In fact, they've surrendered even further since then. So
[00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:45.740]  I sit and look at this situation now and ask, what's going to happen? Probably nothing.
[00:43:45.740 --> 00:43:52.820]  Unfortunately, and that's heartbreaking, and then we all get told Alex, we get told, Paul
[00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:57.780]  gets told, you get told, we get told that we're rejoicing somehow in this. Rejoicing
[00:43:57.780 --> 00:44:01.900]  is something we've tried to prevent. We get told that we're pushing our agenda.
[00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:06.740]  Our only agenda is to stop this, to stop and prevent it happening to more children,
[00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:12.020]  to more women, to more British people. And somehow the same people who accuse us of
[00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:16.740]  that are the same people saying we need to invite more and work more, and it's our fault,
[00:44:16.740 --> 00:44:23.660]  and we need to accept Islam more. I'm sick to death of it, and I can't believe English men,
[00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:27.260]  I keep asking, what is it going to take for you to get up?
[00:44:27.260 --> 00:44:32.020]  The whole country's to be brought to a standstill by now. Every single city in this country should
[00:44:32.020 --> 00:44:38.100]  be gridlocked with men and family men coming out of the barn. What is it going to take?
[00:44:39.100 --> 00:44:43.820]  For folks that don't know your history, you were a good guy, a family guy,
[00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:47.620]  our family guy, put in prison for just having peaceful protest. You've been attacked
[00:44:47.620 --> 00:44:51.660]  literally hundreds of times, more than 50 times I've seen on video. They don't let you
[00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:57.460]  march anywhere in the country with the British flag, because that's a sign of hate in your own
[00:44:57.460 --> 00:45:01.700]  country. We now have the Ninth Circuit banning the American flag here on the East Coast,
[00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:05.100]  saying it's a sign of hate. So tell us about what happened a few weeks ago,
[00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:08.700]  because we're going to play this video for TV and radio listeners, just to give folks an idea
[00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:13.980]  of what it's like for you when you discovered what a local member of government was up to,
[00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:15.900]  you went to his offices, and what happened?
[00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:23.900]  So a local Labour Muslim Councillor, when these men, a gang of men, nine men,
[00:45:23.900 --> 00:45:29.700]  they had raped 48 young English girls, 48. When they were taken to court and prosecuted,
[00:45:29.900 --> 00:45:37.100]  the ex-Muslim mayor and the Labour Councillor went to court and gave them references to say
[00:45:37.100 --> 00:45:43.740]  what great men they were. What great men they are. The Councillor was also responsible for
[00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:48.300]  getting them their taxi license that they used to traffic the young English girls in whilst they
[00:45:48.300 --> 00:45:54.060]  were torturing and raping them. I went to see the Councillor to ask him questions of how
[00:45:54.060 --> 00:45:58.700]  he's still in power. He's actually been promoted, Alex. He's been promoted since this.
[00:45:58.700 --> 00:46:05.340]  I went there and I was met by gangs of Muslims who ran me off the road, who attacked me
[00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:10.940]  to prevent me, to prevent me talking to him. But again, the message we get then is,
[00:46:10.940 --> 00:46:16.140]  I will find that Councillor. This week, I will find him. We will not let it rest because
[00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:21.980]  although I keep saying, what will it take? I have seen something lit in the last three months
[00:46:21.980 --> 00:46:25.820]  when I meet every English man, they're buzzing for it. And they're saying,
[00:46:26.380 --> 00:46:27.340]  I can see the support-
[00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:31.100]  I'll say this, nobody should look for a fight, but these people are looking for one. People
[00:46:31.100 --> 00:46:34.460]  need to start getting as good as they give. People need to start getting, you know,
[00:46:34.460 --> 00:46:35.580]  getting a little bit of you know what.
[00:46:37.580 --> 00:46:41.980]  It has become, the worrying thing is that the government need to listen to,
[00:46:42.940 --> 00:46:48.460]  is that the point is going to come when if you don't protect us, then English men will.
[00:46:49.340 --> 00:46:53.820]  English men will because they will have to. I can't understand when I'm looking at Manchester
[00:46:53.820 --> 00:47:00.380]  now. From my hometown of Luton, when our soldiers were attacked, we gave birth to the United People
[00:47:00.380 --> 00:47:04.620]  of Luton, which then become the English Defence League, which the whole world heard about.
[00:47:04.620 --> 00:47:08.380]  I look at what's happened in Rochdale and I bang my head and ask, where are the men?
[00:47:08.940 --> 00:47:12.940]  Where are the English men? I want to know where the English men are in Manchester.
[00:47:12.940 --> 00:47:17.100]  Where is the reaction to what they have just done? Where is the reaction? Because it's
[00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:21.020]  took me 10 minutes to find the mosque. It's took me 10 minutes to find where they are.
[00:47:21.020 --> 00:47:25.500]  It took me 10 minutes to find the men that have radicalised and promoted this ideology.
[00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:30.380]  And they're walking around this city now. But that is it. And it shouldn't have to take that.
[00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:34.860]  But at some point, a breaking point is going to come. And when that point does come,
[00:47:34.860 --> 00:47:38.780]  it's not going to be good for Islam. It's not going to be good for the decent Muslims.
[00:47:38.780 --> 00:47:41.420]  And that's what they need to understand. Get your house in order
[00:47:41.420 --> 00:47:43.900]  before you leave it upon the British public to get it in order.
[00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:49.020]  I think this political correctness is going to trigger things down the road with the Middle
[00:47:49.020 --> 00:47:52.780]  East because it's turned into a glass parking lot. And I don't even want to see that happen.
[00:47:52.780 --> 00:47:57.580]  I didn't want the clash of civilisations. But I just can see now that our elites have allied
[00:47:57.580 --> 00:48:01.820]  with Islam as their foot soldiers. It's dangerous. It's disgusting. I want to play a
[00:48:01.820 --> 00:48:05.820]  clip of you just a few weeks ago being attacked, run off the road and attacked by a
[00:48:05.820 --> 00:48:10.780]  bunch of out of control, arrogant thugs because you dared try to go do an interview. Here it is.
[00:48:11.900 --> 00:48:15.820]  We was in Rochdale. We were in Rochdale to see Counsellor Hussein. He's a Labour
[00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:19.260]  Counsellor. You've all watched a documentary for Three Girls, which shows the rape and
[00:48:19.260 --> 00:48:25.660]  prostitution of a generation of kids in Rochdale by Muslim gangs. Counsellor Hussein went to court
[00:48:25.660 --> 00:48:30.460]  to defend and give a character reference for one of those men who is now convicted in prison
[00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:35.100]  as part of a gang who raped 98 young English kids. He's still part of the Labour Party.
[00:48:35.100 --> 00:48:40.060]  We went there to ask him and to tell him he has to resign. Our respect to the victims,
[00:48:40.060 --> 00:48:44.380]  he has to resign. He cannot be involved in British politics. When we got there to see
[00:48:44.380 --> 00:48:48.460]  Counsellor Hussein, there were cars waiting. Straight away, they tried to block the road.
[00:48:48.460 --> 00:48:51.260]  There was four cars. They tried to block the road. Unfortunately, our camera wasn't even
[00:48:51.260 --> 00:48:54.540]  rolling because we hadn't even got out of the car. So they tried to block the road.
[00:48:54.540 --> 00:48:58.540]  I had to go up on the pavement to get away. Then you'll see, in the footage you'll see,
[00:48:58.540 --> 00:49:01.980]  that's where it starts, where I pull up, a car pulls up next to me, and then I ask
[00:49:01.980 --> 00:49:05.020]  them, why are you trying to block the road? Why are you trying to block us in? Why are you
[00:49:05.020 --> 00:49:09.580]  jumping out of cars? At that point, you'll see our car window was smashed. I then drove
[00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:12.300]  on. You'll see another young Muslim try and punch through the window.
[00:49:12.620 --> 00:49:18.540]  And then we've been proceeding in a bit of a car chase with some cars full of Muslims.
[00:49:18.540 --> 00:49:22.060]  That's pretty much it. And then there was a little bit of ramming on the road as well.
[00:49:22.620 --> 00:49:26.620]  So this doesn't change anything. Counsellor Hussein, if you think that
[00:49:27.420 --> 00:49:30.860]  you can get your street gangs, and this is the worrying thing for me,
[00:49:30.860 --> 00:49:35.500]  is that you have street level gangs who are drug dealers and who are pimping and
[00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:39.420]  prostituting young English girls, and then you have Labour representatives going to court.
[00:49:40.300 --> 00:49:44.780]  Let's stop right there. We're gonna go to break. The full video is up on mfullwars.com,
[00:49:44.780 --> 00:49:47.900]  and we covered it just last week. We're gonna go to break and come back and look at some
[00:49:47.900 --> 00:49:52.940]  of the facts of what just happened and the different numbers. Five million military
[00:49:52.940 --> 00:49:53.980]  aged men have been brought in.
[00:49:54.130 --> 00:50:02.250]  This is like 6-7 million refugees total, 5 million in the last 3-4 years, 80% military
[00:50:02.250 --> 00:50:07.090]  age men, thousands and thousands every month coming in that they admit, Interpol admits
[00:50:07.090 --> 00:50:10.690]  are ISIS, are Al-Qaeda, and they're letting them back in.
[00:50:10.690 --> 00:50:16.250]  In Sweden and Belgium in places, you can pull up the news, they have government funding
[00:50:16.250 --> 00:50:22.370]  and welfare for them to quote, help them that they have PTSD like they're soldiers of
[00:50:22.370 --> 00:50:28.810]  Sweden or soldiers of Denmark or soldiers of Belgium.
[00:50:28.810 --> 00:50:33.570]  And they bring them in and actually pay for them and put them on welfare, I mean this
[00:50:33.570 --> 00:50:35.290]  is the craziest thing.
[00:50:35.290 --> 00:50:39.490]  Also when we come back, I'm going to do a brief plug here because we fund this operation
[00:50:39.490 --> 00:50:43.690]  by the products we sell at InfoWarsStore.com and we have been sold out of a bunch of
[00:50:43.690 --> 00:50:48.970]  our best selling products for months, like Supermel Vitality X2 for a few weeks and
[00:50:48.970 --> 00:50:53.090]  other products and those are our main funders, so it's been hurting us to not have those.
[00:50:53.090 --> 00:50:58.530]  They're back in and we have them discounted out of the gates for the Memorial Day holiday,
[00:50:58.530 --> 00:51:01.530]  InfoWarsStore.com, so take advantage of that.

[00:52:05.830 --> 00:52:08.830]  I was making great progress on building my savings,
[00:52:08.830 --> 00:52:10.830]  but then I got hit with an unexpected car repair bill.

[00:54:24.830 --> 00:54:26.830]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:54:26.830 --> 00:54:31.830]  Tommy Robinson is the Paul Revere of the UK warning of all this.
[00:54:31.830 --> 00:54:33.830]  Everything he said turned out to be true.
[00:54:33.830 --> 00:54:35.830]  Giant child kidnapping rings per town.
[00:54:35.830 --> 00:54:36.830]  Hundreds of missing kids.
[00:54:36.830 --> 00:54:38.830]  Hundreds of dead nationwide.
[00:54:38.830 --> 00:54:39.830]  Thousands missing.
[00:54:39.830 --> 00:54:41.830]  It all came out in court.
[00:54:41.830 --> 00:54:43.830]  He was put in prison.
[00:54:43.830 --> 00:54:45.830]  They should make a movie about this guy.
[00:54:45.830 --> 00:54:47.830]  The persecution, how they called him racist.
[00:54:47.830 --> 00:54:48.830]  None of it was true.
[00:54:48.830 --> 00:54:50.830]  He was exposing people that were racist.
[00:54:50.830 --> 00:54:53.830]  And now, I didn't even know that he was late even coming on with us.
[00:54:53.830 --> 00:55:00.830]  He's marching to the vigil that the politicians involved working with the Muslims are holding the vigil.
[00:55:00.830 --> 00:55:02.830]  And then his screen just went dead.
[00:55:02.830 --> 00:55:08.830]  I was going to see if we could get him back on as he goes to the vigil.
[00:55:08.830 --> 00:55:09.830]  But we just lost him.
[00:55:09.830 --> 00:55:10.830]  Wow.
[00:55:10.830 --> 00:55:12.830]  That's how fast stuff's moving here.
[00:55:12.830 --> 00:55:13.830]  We called Tommy.
[00:55:13.830 --> 00:55:14.830]  He said, could you come on?
[00:55:14.830 --> 00:55:15.830]  He goes, yes, I can come on.
[00:55:15.830 --> 00:55:16.830]  And then during the break, he goes, I got to go.
[00:55:16.830 --> 00:55:17.830]  The vigil's in five minutes.
[00:55:17.830 --> 00:55:18.830]  It's starting now.
[00:55:18.830 --> 00:55:19.830]  But I'm only two blocks away.
[00:55:19.830 --> 00:55:22.830]  And then he starts walking up to the vigil right as the feed cut.
[00:55:22.830 --> 00:55:25.830]  So this is real TV, folks.
[00:55:25.830 --> 00:55:26.830]  Real radio.
[00:55:26.830 --> 00:55:27.830]  Wow.
[00:55:27.830 --> 00:55:29.830]  That guy is amazing.
[00:55:29.830 --> 00:55:33.830]  I'll be honest.
[00:55:33.830 --> 00:55:36.830]  I used to see his stuff 10 years ago and go, oh, look at that racist or whatever.
[00:55:36.830 --> 00:55:37.830]  This is the media said it.
[00:55:37.830 --> 00:55:39.830]  That's how weak-minded even I am.
[00:55:39.830 --> 00:55:41.830]  Folks, they lie about everybody.
[00:55:41.830 --> 00:55:46.830]  If there was a group of people in Mexico that had come from some other country raping and murdering,
[00:55:46.830 --> 00:55:48.830]  if they were white people, I'd say kill them.
[00:55:49.830 --> 00:55:51.830]  Or if they were blue people, you know?
[00:55:51.830 --> 00:55:54.830]  I mean, at a certain point, you don't care what color you are.
[00:55:54.830 --> 00:55:57.830]  When you're being killed and overrun, you have a right to stand up against it.
[00:55:57.830 --> 00:55:59.830]  And this is Islamic and they prey on women.
[00:55:59.830 --> 00:56:01.830]  And I'm tired of it.
[00:56:01.830 --> 00:56:03.830]  We got his feedback.
[00:56:03.830 --> 00:56:05.830]  I've got to do this or we want to be on the air.
[00:56:05.830 --> 00:56:08.830]  Briefly, we've got all our best products.

[00:56:26.830 --> 00:56:27.830]  X2 for weeks.
[00:56:27.830 --> 00:56:28.830]  Months on the silver.
[00:56:28.830 --> 00:56:31.830]  Sold out, but 40% off.
[00:56:31.830 --> 00:56:32.830]  Unbelievable.

[00:56:51.830 --> 00:56:52.830]  Deodorant.
[00:56:52.830 --> 00:56:53.830]  You name it.
[00:56:53.830 --> 00:56:54.830]  Okay.
[00:56:54.830 --> 00:56:55.830]  Let's go to Manchester.
[00:56:55.830 --> 00:56:57.830]  We're reporting from the ground is Tommy Robinson.
[00:56:57.830 --> 00:56:58.830]  Tommy, wow.
[00:56:58.830 --> 00:56:59.830]  Tell us what you're doing.
[00:56:59.830 --> 00:57:00.830]  Where you're going.
[00:57:00.830 --> 00:57:05.830]  Well, I'm sure we're walking through the city and we was here today during the day.
[00:57:05.830 --> 00:57:08.830]  You'll be able to see the videos going up on Red Bull.
[00:57:08.830 --> 00:57:12.830]  Where there was there was there was from scares everywhere.
[00:57:12.830 --> 00:57:14.830]  People running through the shopping centers.
[00:57:14.830 --> 00:57:17.830]  Even now, I think if a balloon went off, the whole city would run from fear.
[00:57:17.830 --> 00:57:19.830]  And there's a vigil.
[00:57:19.830 --> 00:57:25.830]  So organized by Andy Burnham, who is the MP who is working with the Muslim extremist group.
[00:57:25.830 --> 00:57:27.830]  Who shares a platform with them.
[00:57:27.830 --> 00:57:28.830]  He's organizing the vigil.
[00:57:28.830 --> 00:57:30.830]  He's now the mayor of Greater Manchester.
[00:57:30.830 --> 00:57:32.830]  He's in charge of the whole police force.
[00:57:32.830 --> 00:57:35.830]  So, yeah, he's organized a vigil for people to come together.
[00:57:35.830 --> 00:57:37.830]  This is one of the vigils which you see across.
[00:57:37.830 --> 00:57:39.830]  And so he can be the hero.
[00:57:39.830 --> 00:57:40.830]  He can know the peace.
[00:57:40.830 --> 00:57:41.830]  Let's run up white flags.
[00:57:41.830 --> 00:57:42.830]  Let me be your boss.
[00:57:42.830 --> 00:57:43.830]  Just lay down.
[00:57:43.830 --> 00:57:44.830]  Let us talk.
[00:57:44.830 --> 00:57:45.830]  Let us put the handcuffs on.
[00:57:45.830 --> 00:57:47.830]  Get in the yellow Volkswagen.
[00:57:47.830 --> 00:57:49.830]  Let us get you in the basement.
[00:57:49.830 --> 00:57:50.830]  Go ahead.
[00:57:50.830 --> 00:57:51.830]  That's it.
[00:57:51.830 --> 00:57:52.830]  That's it.
[00:57:52.830 --> 00:57:54.830]  And that's what I didn't even know this.
[00:57:54.830 --> 00:57:57.830]  I've only just started researching Manchester since I got up here this morning.
[00:57:57.830 --> 00:58:01.830]  And again, just I've only had to scratch beneath the surface.
[00:58:01.830 --> 00:58:04.830]  It took me ten minutes to find things out.
[00:58:04.830 --> 00:58:05.830]  Ten minutes to find things out.
[00:58:05.830 --> 00:58:10.830]  But I believe now this is one of these vigils where it doesn't do anything, does it?
[00:58:10.830 --> 00:58:12.830]  I understand the feeling of coming together.
[00:58:12.830 --> 00:58:13.830]  It's not going to.
[00:58:13.830 --> 00:58:18.830]  But it makes the people that allowed it to happen look like they care about everybody on the conciliators.
[00:58:18.830 --> 00:58:20.830]  They're the people standing up there.
[00:58:20.830 --> 00:58:23.830]  They're the people that are going to be standing up there telling us how we'll come through this.
[00:58:23.830 --> 00:58:29.830]  We'll stop this while sharing a platform and appeasing the group who are radicalizing the people in these communities.
[00:58:29.830 --> 00:58:31.830]  Tommy, how far away are you from the vigil?
[00:58:31.830 --> 00:58:33.830]  I have no idea, Alex.
[00:58:33.830 --> 00:58:35.830]  I thought you said you were pretty close.
[00:58:35.830 --> 00:58:36.830]  Four minutes.
[00:58:36.830 --> 00:58:37.830]  Four minutes.
[00:58:37.830 --> 00:58:38.830]  Hold on.
[00:58:38.830 --> 00:58:39.830]  We're going to come right back in 70 seconds.
[00:58:39.830 --> 00:58:41.830]  This is riveting, amazing.
[00:58:41.830 --> 00:58:47.830]  On the streets of Manchester where the man has been imprisoned for protesting or filming Muslims.
[00:58:47.830 --> 00:58:49.830]  Because Muslims are God.
[00:58:49.830 --> 00:58:56.830]  More than two years ago, Infowars first told you about our research into what has been called the iodine conspiracy.
[00:58:56.830 --> 00:59:02.830]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ.
[00:59:02.830 --> 00:59:07.830]  And how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride.
[00:59:07.830 --> 00:59:10.830]  The bad member of the halogen family into the water.
[00:59:10.830 --> 00:59:13.830]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in.
[00:59:13.830 --> 00:59:20.830]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[00:59:20.830 --> 00:59:27.830]  Now in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut.
[00:59:27.830 --> 00:59:33.830]  Which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[00:59:33.830 --> 00:59:35.830]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[00:59:35.830 --> 00:59:41.830]  This is the real deal folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential in my view to any optimum health regimen.
[00:59:41.830 --> 00:59:50.830]  Stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at Infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[00:59:50.970 --> 00:59:56.810]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:59:58.910 --> 01:00:10.310]  From the front lines, Tommy Robinson in Manchester's side of the terror bombing last night.
[01:00:10.310 --> 01:00:15.430]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:15.430 --> 01:00:18.910]  And you've got to look long and hard to hear him saying it's Islamic, but it is, they've
[01:00:18.910 --> 01:00:20.190]  taken credit.
[01:00:20.190 --> 01:00:22.870]  Tommy Robinson, this is a short segment, long segment coming up.
[01:00:22.870 --> 01:00:26.790]  He's about three minutes away from the vigil being held by the very local leaders
[01:00:26.790 --> 01:00:31.230]  reportedly that have been working with radical Islam, protecting the mosque, protecting the
[01:00:31.230 --> 01:00:33.350]  people coming back as ISIS fighters.
[01:00:33.350 --> 01:00:35.890]  That's mainstream UK news.
[01:00:35.890 --> 01:00:36.890]  This is incredible.
[01:00:36.890 --> 01:00:40.069]  And Tommy Robinson, feel free to take over here and tell us who the crowd is that's
[01:00:40.069 --> 01:00:44.589]  just joined you on the street, marching with you, like right out of Fight Club.
[01:00:44.589 --> 01:00:47.910]  Yeah, they were just local English lads, local English lads.
[01:00:47.910 --> 01:00:48.910]  This is their city, isn't it?
[01:00:48.910 --> 01:00:49.910]  This is their city.
[01:00:49.910 --> 01:00:52.350]  Well, they were saying, but I saw folks that were white, that were brown, you name
[01:00:52.350 --> 01:00:53.350]  it, giving us thumbs up.
[01:00:53.350 --> 01:00:54.350]  Yeah, yeah, black lads, yeah.
[01:00:54.910 --> 01:00:58.830]  Yeah, that's what, you have to understand this whole myth.
[01:00:58.830 --> 01:00:59.830]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:00:59.830 --> 01:01:04.990]  The black community, especially where I'm from, we're like this, we're like this.
[01:01:04.990 --> 01:01:07.589]  When it comes to this is an ideology that has no color.
[01:01:07.589 --> 01:01:08.589]  This is an ideology.
[01:01:08.589 --> 01:01:13.390]  In fact, many of the most radical Muslims now are white, unfortunately in the UK, especially
[01:01:13.390 --> 01:01:14.390]  in the prison system.
[01:01:14.390 --> 01:01:17.670]  Well, plus, most Africans have been bombed or attacked by Muslim groups.
[01:01:17.670 --> 01:01:20.629]  They've really experienced the Islamic invasion in Africa.
[01:01:20.629 --> 01:01:24.109]  Yeah, well, they've embraced, they've embraced the country.
[01:01:24.870 --> 01:01:28.589]  As I said, my mom was an immigrant to this country, and she embraced it, and as her children,
[01:01:28.589 --> 01:01:29.589]  we embraced it.
[01:01:29.589 --> 01:01:30.589]  And that's the same with them.
[01:01:30.589 --> 01:01:32.009]  They've embraced it and love it.
[01:01:32.009 --> 01:01:34.190]  But there's one section of the community who don't.
[01:01:34.190 --> 01:01:38.069]  One section of immigrants that have come here, who refuse to, who are now third generation.
[01:01:38.069 --> 01:01:41.549]  I believe this man was second generation, but second and third generation, the problem's
[01:01:41.549 --> 01:01:42.549]  getting worse and worse.
[01:01:42.549 --> 01:01:44.069]  The problem's getting worse and worse.
[01:01:44.069 --> 01:01:48.950]  The hatred, the pure hatred against our way of life, our culture, our history, everything
[01:01:48.950 --> 01:01:49.950]  about us.
[01:01:49.990 --> 01:01:55.149]  I've noticed a lot of the British leaders are white Muslims and seem to be the most
[01:01:55.149 --> 01:01:56.149]  aggressive.
[01:01:56.149 --> 01:01:57.149]  What's going on with that?
[01:01:57.149 --> 01:02:01.670]  Yeah, and in the prison, do you know what's happened is we've lost our identity as English
[01:02:01.670 --> 01:02:02.670]  people.
[01:02:02.670 --> 01:02:03.670]  We've lost our history.
[01:02:03.670 --> 01:02:07.310]  We've not been allowed to be proud in who we are, proud in our history or our culture.
[01:02:07.310 --> 01:02:08.790]  So there's something missing anyway.
[01:02:08.790 --> 01:02:10.350]  So Islam fills that void.
[01:02:10.350 --> 01:02:13.710]  They then join Islam, and they're allowed to be proud in their identity.
[01:02:13.710 --> 01:02:17.990]  And they're given a real strong sense of belief in identity and belonging, which has
[01:02:17.990 --> 01:02:19.790]  been lost, purposely lost.
[01:02:19.790 --> 01:02:20.790]  They're orchestrated.
[01:02:20.790 --> 01:02:21.790]  They've done that on purpose.
[01:02:21.790 --> 01:02:25.310]  I said most English kids who are 16 are walking around with their heads down, walking
[01:02:25.310 --> 01:02:26.670]  around with their heads down.
[01:02:26.670 --> 01:02:31.430]  So they take culture away and then bring in either leftist globalism or Islam.
[01:02:31.430 --> 01:02:35.950]  Why do you think the left is so allied, again, Tommy Robinson on the ground in Manchester
[01:02:35.950 --> 01:02:41.509]  investigating live, why do you think that the left is so allied with Islam?
[01:02:41.509 --> 01:02:46.589]  I always say it's the Marxism communists aligning with Islam, and they both hate each
[01:02:46.589 --> 01:02:47.589]  other.
[01:02:47.589 --> 01:02:50.190]  But they're simply using each other.
[01:02:50.190 --> 01:02:52.190]  They're simply using each other.
[01:02:52.190 --> 01:02:53.190]  They're using each other.
[01:02:53.190 --> 01:02:56.029]  And I think this is, is this where it is now?
[01:02:56.029 --> 01:02:57.629]  Will you give us a shot forward then?
[01:02:57.629 --> 01:02:58.629]  We'll still be able to hear you.
[01:02:58.629 --> 01:02:59.629]  Just go ahead and turn it around.
[01:02:59.629 --> 01:03:04.029]  Tommy Robinson reporting for a lot of great websites and a lot of great work he's
[01:03:04.029 --> 01:03:05.029]  doing.
[01:03:05.029 --> 01:03:08.830]  You can check them out, obviously, online at therebelmedia.com, tommyrobbinson.co.uk,
[01:03:08.830 --> 01:03:10.830]  but therebelmedia.com.
[01:03:10.830 --> 01:03:11.830]  A lot of great folks there.
[01:03:11.830 --> 01:03:13.830]  Look at that beautiful old city of Manchester.
[01:03:13.830 --> 01:03:20.670]  And this is the vigil, probably be led by Muslims telling us, you know, that we should
[01:03:20.670 --> 01:03:21.670]  all worship them.
[01:03:21.670 --> 01:03:24.670]  Look at the gorgeous architecture there.
[01:03:24.670 --> 01:03:33.910]  There's a way to get to this and then there we go.
[01:03:33.910 --> 01:03:34.910]  Oh, good.
[01:03:34.910 --> 01:03:38.950]  He's just teaching Tommy how to flip that around by hitting the bill.
[01:03:38.950 --> 01:03:39.950]  I'm the same way.
[01:03:39.950 --> 01:03:41.950]  I'm not savvy with the tech stuff.
[01:03:41.950 --> 01:03:46.270]  You know, I love how people say, look at the Muslim architecture in Turkey.
[01:03:46.270 --> 01:03:47.270]  Oh, my God.
[01:03:47.270 --> 01:03:48.670]  Look at the Blue Moss was built by Christians.
[01:03:48.670 --> 01:03:51.950]  I'm not saying the Muslims haven't built some amazing architecture and didn't invent
[01:03:51.950 --> 01:03:52.950]  a lot of science.
[01:03:52.950 --> 01:03:53.950]  That that'd be a lie.
[01:03:53.950 --> 01:03:54.950]  I'm not.
[01:03:54.950 --> 01:03:57.629]  I'm just saying that the Muslims had a golden age before, especially before they were Muslims
[01:03:57.629 --> 01:04:05.589]  1400 years ago, and I'm sorry, folks, I was against the Iraq war.
[01:04:05.589 --> 01:04:09.310]  All of it because we were overthrowing non radical Muslims.
[01:04:09.310 --> 01:04:11.910]  I don't want to fight with the Muslims, but I cannot put up with this anymore.
[01:04:12.870 --> 01:04:15.870]  Tommy Robinson again, reporting, we're going to go to break.
[01:04:15.870 --> 01:04:19.390]  My friend will back in three minutes and you can take over if you want to report from
[01:04:19.390 --> 01:04:22.109]  the scene for folks there.
[01:04:22.109 --> 01:04:25.589]  So again, he's approaching the vigil right now.
[01:04:25.589 --> 01:04:26.589]  We've got to go to break.
[01:04:26.589 --> 01:04:27.910]  These are hard breaks on the network.
[01:04:27.910 --> 01:04:30.810]  So, Tommy, if you want to turn it back around, get a good signal.
[01:04:30.810 --> 01:04:31.810]  We appreciate you.
[01:04:31.810 --> 01:04:32.810]  We'll be back to you in three minutes.
[01:04:32.810 --> 01:04:33.810]  OK.
[01:04:33.810 --> 01:04:34.810]  All right.
[01:04:34.810 --> 01:04:39.149]  I guess he didn't have his earpiece now, actually, but turn it around.
[01:04:39.149 --> 01:04:41.430]  Let's ask him to now let him take over.
[01:04:41.950 --> 01:04:47.230]  And then Tommy will report from Manchester at the vigil that has nothing to do with Islamic
[01:04:47.230 --> 01:04:54.910]  attacking us last night, according to the media, according to according to George Soros's
[01:04:54.910 --> 01:04:55.910]  group.
[01:04:55.910 --> 01:04:56.910]  It's all my fault.
[01:04:56.910 --> 01:04:57.910]  We'll be back.
[01:04:57.910 --> 01:04:58.910]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:04:58.910 --> 01:05:02.790]  This is the info war.
[01:05:02.790 --> 01:05:07.790]  All the perplexities, the confusion and distress in America arise not from objects in their
[01:05:07.790 --> 01:05:13.390]  constitution or confederation, not from want of honor or virtue, so much as from the downright
[01:05:13.390 --> 01:05:16.790]  ignorance of the nature of coin, credit and circulation.
[01:05:16.790 --> 01:05:20.890]  Those are the words of John Adams, the second president of the United States.
[01:05:20.890 --> 01:05:23.470]  Are you ignorant of the private Federal Reserve?
[01:05:23.470 --> 01:05:25.670]  Do you understand the nature of our fiat currency?
[01:05:25.670 --> 01:05:31.470]  Do you understand how a private corporation has the ability to create boom and bust cycles
[01:05:31.470 --> 01:05:32.470]  and to profit from it?
[01:05:32.470 --> 01:05:36.750]  What kind of leverage do these people in the Federal Reserve have over the American
[01:05:36.750 --> 01:05:37.750]  people?
[01:05:37.750 --> 01:05:38.750]  What does that matter?
[01:05:38.750 --> 01:05:41.910]  What kind of leverage do the Saudis have over our money?
[01:05:41.910 --> 01:05:44.310]  Will you be a slave or will you be free?
[01:05:44.310 --> 01:05:49.270]  Adams also said liberty cannot be preserved without general knowledge among the people.
[01:05:49.270 --> 01:05:54.670]  Join the info wars, spread the information, educate yourself and others, the truth shall
[01:05:54.670 --> 01:05:55.670]  set you free.
[01:05:55.670 --> 01:06:01.350]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knighton.
[01:06:01.350 --> 01:06:05.710]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[01:06:05.710 --> 01:06:10.430]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[01:06:10.430 --> 01:06:11.950]  to detoxify the body.
[01:06:11.950 --> 01:06:16.830]  That's why I'm introducing Z shield, toxic metal and chemical defense support.
[01:06:16.830 --> 01:06:18.350]  It's made in the USA.
[01:06:18.350 --> 01:06:23.270]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying
[01:06:23.270 --> 01:06:25.089]  the body and it supports the info war.
[01:06:25.089 --> 01:06:27.350]  It is a classical 360 win.
[01:06:27.350 --> 01:06:31.850]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe
[01:06:31.850 --> 01:06:36.730]  we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly
[01:06:36.730 --> 01:06:37.730]  get.
[01:06:37.730 --> 01:06:40.730]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family and you owe it to the future of this
[01:06:40.730 --> 01:06:45.569]  country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as
[01:06:45.569 --> 01:06:50.890]  you can be because we need you, the remnant of America to reignite those brush fires
[01:06:50.890 --> 01:06:54.649]  the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be thanks to your support
[01:06:54.649 --> 01:06:56.009]  and your prayers together.
[01:06:56.009 --> 01:06:57.009]  We're changing the world.
[01:06:57.009 --> 01:07:01.529]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z shield and infowarslife.com.
[01:07:01.529 --> 01:07:05.490]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you

[01:07:25.370 --> 01:07:30.890]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50 listeners have been
[01:07:30.890 --> 01:07:35.410]  requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that
[01:07:35.410 --> 01:07:36.410]  you need each month.

[01:07:49.330 --> 01:07:54.890]  this is a sure win 10% off on auto ship win, win, win at infowarslife.com free

[01:08:12.370 --> 01:08:22.570]  Resistance to tyrants, his obedience to God, it's Alex Jones.
[01:08:22.570 --> 01:08:28.769]  All right, we've had Tommy Robinson, who is a journalist and nationalist standing up for
[01:08:28.769 --> 01:08:36.969]  free speech and sovereignty and Christianity and the UK on with us, he got to the vigil
[01:08:36.969 --> 01:08:42.790]  there in front of the main government building in Manchester, UK, close to where Paul Watson
[01:08:42.790 --> 01:08:46.830]  grew up and then there were so many people obviously on their cell phones that the signal
[01:08:46.830 --> 01:08:49.130]  degraded and we lost it.
[01:08:49.130 --> 01:08:57.130]  But we do have a live feed from the vigil where all the usual leftist suspects that
[01:08:57.130 --> 01:09:03.330]  have let the Islamists stand, that have done all this, stand up there and lecture
[01:09:03.330 --> 01:09:06.410]  everyone, we're going to keep our borders open, we're going to bring in more military
[01:09:06.410 --> 01:09:10.630]  aged men, we're going to let them organize, we're going to let them sexually mutilate
[01:09:10.630 --> 01:09:13.850]  their daughters, we're going to let them put hoods on their heads and we're going
[01:09:13.850 --> 01:09:16.650]  to submit because we're loving.
[01:09:16.700 --> 01:09:21.700]  And that's basically what gets spewed.
[01:09:21.700 --> 01:09:25.660]  Here, let's hear what they have to say right now, marching up all the controlled government
[01:09:25.660 --> 01:09:29.080]  churches telling us to all just bend over to Islam.
[01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:37.139]  Here it is, let's listen to this.
[01:09:37.139 --> 01:09:38.139]  That's clapping.
[01:09:38.139 --> 01:09:46.099]  Oh again, I could hear the audio earlier during the break.
[01:09:46.099 --> 01:09:50.179]  But this is live coverage of what's happening there.
[01:09:50.179 --> 01:09:53.059]  Paul Watson has the latest report up on InfoWars.com.
[01:09:53.059 --> 01:10:01.300]  You've got 22 dead, mainly teenage girls that went to hear a pop rock concert.
[01:10:01.300 --> 01:10:04.940]  And you've got more than 50 injured, meanwhile, London police aren't really investigating
[01:10:04.940 --> 01:10:05.940]  the jihadis.
[01:10:05.940 --> 01:10:09.300]  No, they've launched a free speech crackdown amid Manchester attack.
[01:10:09.340 --> 01:10:17.540]  They say they're criminally investigating anyone that criticizes Islam or calls for an investigation
[01:10:17.540 --> 01:10:26.060]  of Islam because this wasn't an Islamic attack and they won't show you the dead bodies because
[01:10:26.060 --> 01:10:28.220]  they don't want you to personalize the people that were killed.
[01:10:28.220 --> 01:10:36.740]  They want to continue the Islamic invasion and the Islamic takeover.
[01:10:36.740 --> 01:10:41.080]  Now I want to go over the facts dealing with this case and play some more clips and then
[01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:45.620]  open the phones up so that you have a chance to respond.
[01:10:45.620 --> 01:10:50.980]  But leftists have now been bemoaning Islamophobia backlash on social media following Manchester
[01:10:50.980 --> 01:10:52.140]  terror attack.
[01:10:52.140 --> 01:10:58.660]  And if you watch UK or EU news, it's very hard to hear anybody calling it an Islamic
[01:10:58.660 --> 01:10:59.660]  attack.
[01:10:59.660 --> 01:11:05.000]  All right, we've got some of the audio now from the Manchester Peace rally, which
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:06.340]  means run up the white flag.
[01:11:06.340 --> 01:11:11.460]  I have stacks of news where they have anti Islamophobia rallies in the UK and in
[01:11:11.460 --> 01:11:12.460]  Europe.
[01:11:12.460 --> 01:11:17.060]  And when the women go, they get raped at the rallies in public, gang raped.
[01:11:17.060 --> 01:11:22.180]  And the police won't do anything because it's a sacrament to the goddess of Islam,
[01:11:22.180 --> 01:11:23.180]  I guess.
[01:11:23.180 --> 01:11:24.180]  A big sarcastic.
[01:11:24.180 --> 01:11:29.180]  But here it is.
[01:11:29.180 --> 01:11:37.380]  Yay, let's run up the white flag.
[01:11:37.380 --> 01:11:38.380]  Yay.
[01:11:38.380 --> 01:11:42.900]  Let's have the very people that ran up the white flag come and lead us into more
[01:11:42.900 --> 01:11:43.900]  bondage.
[01:11:43.900 --> 01:11:44.900]  Yes.
[01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:46.900]  I love it.
[01:11:46.900 --> 01:11:52.940]  And again, it's the way that they sit there and grovel to Islam every time there's
[01:11:52.940 --> 01:11:57.540]  an Islamic attack and won't call it Islamic and say, we won't let this drive us apart.
[01:11:57.540 --> 01:12:02.100]  We will continue to worship Islam will continue to have Stockholm syndrome will continue to
[01:12:02.100 --> 01:12:03.740]  go along with all this.
[01:12:03.740 --> 01:12:09.660]  And in that crowd is Tommy Robinson somewhere, we'll get him back as soon as we're able
[01:12:09.660 --> 01:12:10.660]  to.
[01:12:10.660 --> 01:12:14.540]  The toll free number to join us concerning the attacks concerning Trump's visit the Middle
[01:12:14.540 --> 01:12:19.620]  East where he threw down the gauntlet to Orthodox radical Islam and said, you will
[01:12:19.620 --> 01:12:22.060]  be destroyed, God is against you.
[01:12:22.060 --> 01:12:25.980]  And they responded a day later, didn't they?
[01:12:26.300 --> 01:12:30.020]  There's been reports of thousands and thousands of jihadis coming back into Europe, back into
[01:12:30.020 --> 01:12:34.180]  the UK as Trump destroys Al Qaeda and ISIS in Syria.
[01:12:34.180 --> 01:12:40.300]  There's been warnings that these people check these people, but the UN runs the refugee
[01:12:40.300 --> 01:12:45.860]  program and says, sorry, under international law that you've signed on to, we say who
[01:12:45.860 --> 01:12:48.340]  comes into your country, including the United States.
[01:12:48.500 --> 01:12:57.060]  So let's go over some of the news here.
[01:12:57.060 --> 01:13:04.420]  French president said terrorism part of our daily lives for years to come after the latest
[01:13:04.420 --> 01:13:07.820]  shooting in Paris of police.
[01:13:07.820 --> 01:13:12.260]  Foreign men rape, molest girls in anti-racism, peace and love festival.
[01:13:12.260 --> 01:13:18.540]  There's video of the women being gang raped shot by the Muslims with them lined up, one
[01:13:18.540 --> 01:13:22.660]  man holds each leg, they hold the woman, they choke her, the men line up and rape her and
[01:13:22.660 --> 01:13:25.820]  rape her and rape her and they beg and they beg and they beg.
[01:13:25.820 --> 01:13:28.260]  There's hours of this footage.
[01:13:28.260 --> 01:13:32.560]  I would skip through it and just, it was so horrific, but I only showed screenshots
[01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:38.780]  of the women with total nightmare hell surrender in their eyes, just like, God, why have
[01:13:38.780 --> 01:13:44.140]  you forsaken me as they're being gang raped by the very Muslims they came to worship.
[01:13:44.140 --> 01:13:49.260]  Don't watch the footage if you dare.
[01:13:49.260 --> 01:13:50.700]  Let's continue here.
[01:13:50.700 --> 01:13:56.380]  Cologne women apologize for xenophobia by giving migrant Islamicist roses following
[01:13:56.380 --> 01:14:01.020]  mass public molestation.
[01:14:01.020 --> 01:14:02.020]  Trump was right.
[01:14:02.020 --> 01:14:05.740]  Migrants riot, loot, fight with police and set cars on fire in Sweden.
[01:14:06.740 --> 01:14:09.500]  It was terrible what happened last night in Sweden.
[01:14:09.500 --> 01:14:12.740]  He watched the clip the night before from three days before and then it happened the
[01:14:12.740 --> 01:14:16.540]  day after he said it, but it didn't matter that it happened right behind the day he
[01:14:16.540 --> 01:14:21.060]  said and right after the day they said Trump was wrong.
[01:14:21.060 --> 01:14:23.860]  You know, if Trump told you a lottery ticket number and it came up true, they'd say it
[01:14:23.860 --> 01:14:24.360]  was wrong.
[01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:30.080]  No, the migrants don't rape anybody, they don't hurt anybody. Islam never did anything. They
[01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:34.339]  don't put hoods over women's heads either.
[01:14:34.339 --> 01:14:39.160]  Sweeten, just last week, 70-year-old woman prosecuted for complaining about migrants
[01:14:39.160 --> 01:14:45.599]  defecating in the streets. That's part of their culture, lady.
[01:14:45.599 --> 01:14:55.360]  Meanwhile, Manchester Arena suicide bombing. 22 die in Ariana Grande concert. And by the
[01:14:55.360 --> 01:14:59.599]  way, people ask, what are they going to do? They're going to do nothing. They'll have
[01:14:59.599 --> 01:15:03.080]  checkpoints and search you and all the rest of it, but it'll be an Islamicist, you
[01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:06.920]  know, let you through the back door every time. Hell, most of the time in the UK they're
[01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:07.839]  the ones running the security.
[01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:16.060]  I love how when I fly to the UK Muslim women and men are the ones that ask me questions
[01:15:16.060 --> 01:15:21.240]  and search me and when I'm leaving they do it every time it's Muslims and I'm like is
[01:15:21.240 --> 01:15:25.400]  this a joke but it's not see it's all part of the Stockholm syndrome all part of the
[01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:30.720]  cuckolding all part of the joke it'd be like if weasels or foxes were killing the
[01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:36.840]  henhouse every night so you hired a guard to guard it and it was a fox you know fox
[01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:41.680]  guard the henhouse so I'm I'm walking up I get the 20 questions I get put to the
[01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:45.040]  ringer I get asked why I'm here what what am I doing what do I plant my an
[01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:48.120]  extremist and I'm sitting there gonna be no full well I am and I'm looking at a
[01:15:48.120 --> 01:15:57.320]  Muslim woman wearing a hijab just like what this must be really funny to you
[01:15:57.320 --> 01:15:59.720]  cupcake
[01:15:58.020 --> 01:16:07.940]  Manchester, suicide bombing, 22 plus dead, but that's okay.
[01:16:07.940 --> 01:16:13.700]  Then I've got all the different recent attacks, not counting the Russian one, the Russian
[01:16:13.700 --> 01:16:17.460]  attacks we've seen don't even really get on our news and our media is kind of like, oh
[01:16:17.460 --> 01:16:19.340]  they deserve it, you know.
[01:16:19.340 --> 01:16:23.940]  Recent major terror attacks in Europe, because we can't have any solidarity with Russia
[01:16:23.940 --> 01:16:26.320]  who's fighting Islam more than we are.
[01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:30.720]  We can't have any kinship with a nation and a people that have been fighting Muslims longer
[01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:31.720]  than we have.
[01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:36.080]  No, no, no, no, no, no, they're the enemy because they're actually fighting Muslims.
[01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:41.620]  April 7th, 2017, a man driving a hijacked beer truck struck pedestrians at Stockholm
[01:16:41.620 --> 01:16:45.080]  department store, but don't worry they have Stockholm syndrome so they said it wasn't
[01:16:45.080 --> 01:16:48.200]  Muslim even though it was.
[01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:53.600]  March 22nd, a man drives a rented SUV into pedestrians at London's Westminster Bridge
[01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:54.600]  killing four people.
[01:16:54.600 --> 01:16:58.760]  The attacker then stabbed a police officer while screaming Allah Akbar, but it had nothing
[01:16:58.760 --> 01:17:00.960]  to do with Islam.
[01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:05.600]  December 19th, 2016, a hijacked truck plowed through a Christian market in Berlin killing
[01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:06.100]  12.
[01:17:06.940 --> 01:17:15.419]  In fact, this must be an old list. This doesn't even have the police being shot in France
[01:17:15.419 --> 01:17:23.820]  or the other truck attack in France. No, but whatever. July 14th, a truck driver targets
[01:17:23.820 --> 01:17:29.639]  Bastille Day travelers at Nice killing 86. It was like a video game, little kids running
[01:17:29.639 --> 01:17:33.540]  and then they just plow them over. And again, many of the people killed supported
[01:17:33.540 --> 01:17:37.860]  bringing in the Islamicist. It's like bringing in a rattlesnake and putting it in your bed
[01:17:37.860 --> 01:17:42.500]  at night. It's your fault when it attacks you. I'm not blaming everybody. I'm not blaming
[01:17:42.500 --> 01:17:48.179]  the children. I'm blaming the cuckold white flag culture. Have you looked at Al Qaeda
[01:17:48.179 --> 01:17:55.540]  and ISIS's flag? It's black. That means no surrender. Suicide attacks on the Brussels
[01:17:55.540 --> 01:18:01.620]  Airport and subway kill 32 and injure hundreds. The perpetrators have been closely linked
[01:18:01.620 --> 01:18:07.219]  to the group that carried out earlier attacks in Paris. Islamic State, November 13th, linked
[01:18:07.219 --> 01:18:12.980]  to Shrema's attack, a concert hall and other sites. I'm not going to keep reading all these.
[01:18:12.980 --> 01:18:17.700]  This is just part of them. Now look at all the SWAT teams that show up right after it happens
[01:18:17.700 --> 01:18:21.860]  running around. I'm not against the individual police officers, but you leave the gates open,
[01:18:21.860 --> 01:18:27.700]  you bring the problem in, you protect it. And then you show up after everybody's dead and dying
[01:18:27.700 --> 01:18:34.580]  as the saviors. If you were really the saviors, you'd be politically active,
[01:18:34.580 --> 01:18:39.780]  changing what's happening in your government and not going along with the sellout to the Islamicists.
[01:18:42.580 --> 01:18:48.339]  Sick video shows ISIS's jihadist ominous warning after Manchester Arena blast.
[01:18:49.219 --> 01:18:53.299]  If we've got time to queue that up, it's a short clip. I'm gonna come back and play more
[01:18:53.299 --> 01:18:57.700]  clips and then go to your phone calls. But here's the jihadist celebrating the blast.
[01:18:57.700 --> 01:19:03.780]  ISIS is now officially taking credit. Sick video shows ISIS turd blossom.
[01:19:03.780 --> 01:19:08.660]  A jihadist make ominous warning after Manchester Arena blast. I'd love to get my hands on you,
[01:19:08.660 --> 01:19:12.500]  but I know you're some guy that runs around spewing your anti-Christian garbage.
[01:19:12.500 --> 01:19:16.900]  You're probably on welfare. You're probably in the UK. You're a big lazy punk, probably
[01:19:16.900 --> 01:19:23.139]  wear gangster outfits. You're just the classic wimp, the classic guy that never had a strong
[01:19:23.139 --> 01:19:27.299]  man in his life who thinks being a thug to women and being a little coward makes you
[01:19:27.299 --> 01:19:31.540]  tough because you haven't been around real men to put you in your little cowardly place.
[01:19:31.540 --> 01:19:37.540]  Let's play a clip of this piece of garbage. In the name of Allah, the merciful,
[01:19:37.540 --> 01:19:45.940]  the grateful, this is only the beginning. In the name of Allah, the merciful and the
[01:19:45.940 --> 01:19:52.419]  merciful. I'm going to blow up domesticated people because I want to show them to submit to
[01:19:52.419 --> 01:20:00.259]  me. Media matters will attack Alex Jones because he didn't talk bad about me.
[01:20:01.219 --> 01:20:05.460]  Think about this. Your community's aging water infrastructure systems are very likely
[01:20:05.460 --> 01:20:10.580]  to be contaminated with heavy metals like lead, disinfection chemicals like ammonia, chlorine,
[01:20:10.580 --> 01:20:15.139]  and chloramines, and pharmaceuticals like statins, pain meds, and antidepressants. And no,
[01:20:15.139 --> 01:20:18.980]  water treatment plants are not equipped to filter these pharmaceutical toxins out.

[01:21:31.139 --> 01:21:36.900]  Dateline, October 8, 2013. Tiffany Jenks is shot to death. A sinister murder in Oregon that is
[01:21:36.900 --> 01:21:42.019]  still unsolved and shrouded in mystery, yet no one seems to care. Are the Oregon police covering
[01:21:42.019 --> 01:21:47.299]  something up? Are Illuminati and the New World Order involved? Who really killed Tiffany Jenks?

[01:23:58.840 --> 01:24:00.840]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:37.600]  Live from the future Islamic Caliphate of the United States of America, I'm your host
[01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:38.600]  Alex Jones.
[01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:41.960]  That's where this stuff's going, I'm telling you.
[01:24:41.960 --> 01:24:47.080]  You go to the mall now, it's just the main signs are hajibs, and just how wonderful
[01:24:47.080 --> 01:24:48.080]  it is.
[01:24:48.080 --> 01:24:49.960]  Even though there's really no market in that, and Muslims are a very small part
[01:24:49.960 --> 01:24:53.560]  of our population, we're being conditioned to accept it.
[01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:59.200]  Whether it's the Islamicus mayor of London, or whether it's the new pretty boy appointed
[01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:04.040]  into power there in France, Macron, it doesn't matter.
[01:25:04.040 --> 01:25:09.280]  The same message over and over again is, we must get used to Islamic terror attacks
[01:25:09.280 --> 01:25:12.080]  and accept it.
[01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:15.320]  It's part of being a great global city, a great global order.
[01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:22.560]  It's the same talking points, the same agenda, because the Muslims have six kids on average.
[01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:27.160]  The West was induced to have 1.3 children, so the globalists say they're replacing us
[01:25:27.160 --> 01:25:28.640]  with Islam.
[01:25:28.640 --> 01:25:32.520]  Okay, well here's the deal.
[01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:35.760]  I don't want to have to put hoods over my daughter's faces, or cut their genitals
[01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:39.600]  off, or not let them drive cars, and have them have huge spy grids that are used to
[01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:44.040]  spy on everybody, run by the Muslims, I mean this is just crazy.
[01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:48.740]  But here's the little arrogant mayor helping bring in Sharia law, he says quote, he's
[01:25:48.740 --> 01:25:52.380]  not an Uncle Tom, that's a quote, he's going to bring in Islam.
[01:25:52.380 --> 01:25:57.500]  Here he is talking about just getting used to bombings.
[01:25:57.500 --> 01:26:04.660]  As to who was responsible, I'm not going to speculate as to how the police in New York
[01:26:04.660 --> 01:26:05.660]  should react.
[01:26:05.660 --> 01:26:09.980]  What I do know is part and parcel of living in a great global city is you've got to
[01:26:09.980 --> 01:26:11.980]  be prepared for these things.
[01:26:11.980 --> 01:26:16.620]  Now by the way, when I say the UK police are to blame, I don't mean the average cop,
[01:26:16.620 --> 01:26:18.580]  the media will say he said the average cop was to blame.
[01:26:18.580 --> 01:26:20.740]  Well I mean the bureaucrats, the politicians, the system.
[01:26:20.740 --> 01:26:23.940]  But you've actually got to hand it to the Manchester police, they said this is
[01:26:23.940 --> 01:26:29.260]  a terror attack, and they go on to say it's connected to an Islamic extremist.
[01:26:29.260 --> 01:26:33.380]  That is a revolutionary act of the UK, because if you watch the news there, we had Tommy
[01:26:33.380 --> 01:26:38.180]  Robinson on earlier live from Manchester, you have to dig to find that, they will not
[01:26:38.180 --> 01:26:40.180]  say it.
[01:26:40.180 --> 01:26:42.340]  Now I've got a bunch of clips I want to get to here, but
[01:26:42.470 --> 01:26:52.370]  A big one that's really, really important is this clip of the president in his response
[01:26:52.370 --> 01:26:53.370]  to the attack.
[01:26:53.370 --> 01:26:57.950]  And then you can look at what he said the day before in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, where
[01:26:57.950 --> 01:26:59.670]  he declared them cowards.
[01:26:59.670 --> 01:27:01.110]  He said, stop what you're doing.
[01:27:01.110 --> 01:27:08.470]  And then their response was, we're going to go to a teenager girl pop place where the
[01:27:08.470 --> 01:27:09.810]  girls are taught to be trendy.
[01:27:09.810 --> 01:27:10.810]  They're taught to be liberal.
[01:27:10.810 --> 01:27:12.010]  They're taught to have open borders.
[01:27:12.010 --> 01:27:13.770]  They're taught to accept the Muslims.
[01:27:13.770 --> 01:27:14.770]  They're taught all this.
[01:27:14.770 --> 01:27:15.770]  It's not their fault.
[01:27:15.770 --> 01:27:16.950]  It's the state's fault.
[01:27:16.950 --> 01:27:18.230]  It's the government's fault.
[01:27:18.230 --> 01:27:22.690]  It's the adult trendies that are undoubtedly there overseeing this that just keep saying
[01:27:22.690 --> 01:27:23.690]  everything's fine.
[01:27:23.690 --> 01:27:24.690]  Everything's fine.
[01:27:24.690 --> 01:27:28.770]  Capitulate, capitulate when everything's not fine.
[01:27:28.770 --> 01:27:31.490]  These poor girls have nobody to stand up for them.
[01:27:31.490 --> 01:27:35.930]  In fact, the men are so unmanly now in many European countries that the women are
[01:27:35.930 --> 01:27:40.110]  going for Islam because they think having a guy that wipes his butt with his hand and
[01:27:40.110 --> 01:27:45.690]  wears an outfit but tells a shop op, get in there and cook me slave.
[01:27:45.690 --> 01:27:52.050]  They think that's manly because Western men have become such cucks.
[01:27:52.050 --> 01:27:53.370]  So here is the president.
[01:27:53.370 --> 01:28:02.910]  I extend my deepest condolences to those so terribly injured in this terrorist attack
[01:28:02.910 --> 01:28:11.770]  and to the many killed and the families, so many families of the victims.
[01:28:11.770 --> 01:28:19.270]  We stand in absolute solidarity with the people of the United Kingdom.
[01:28:19.270 --> 01:28:26.710]  So many young, beautiful, innocent people living and enjoying their lives murdered
[01:28:26.710 --> 01:28:31.490]  by evil losers in life.
[01:28:31.490 --> 01:28:38.790]  I won't call them monsters because they would like that term.
[01:28:38.790 --> 01:28:43.070]  They would think that's a great name.
[01:28:43.070 --> 01:28:50.830]  I will call them from now on losers because that's what they are.
[01:28:50.830 --> 01:28:56.910]  They're losers and we'll have more of them, but they're losers.
[01:28:56.910 --> 01:29:01.830]  Just remember that.
[01:29:01.830 --> 01:29:07.530]  This is what I've spent these last few days talking about during my trip overseas.
[01:29:07.530 --> 01:29:16.490]  Our society can have no tolerance for this continuation of bloodshed.
[01:29:16.490 --> 01:29:23.130]  We cannot stand a moment longer for the slaughter of innocent people.
[01:29:23.130 --> 01:29:33.350]  And in today's attack, it was mostly innocent children, the terrorists and extremists and
[01:29:33.350 --> 01:29:40.790]  those who give them aid and comfort must be driven out from our society forever.
[01:29:40.790 --> 01:29:43.990]  This wicked ideology must be obliterated.
[01:29:43.990 --> 01:29:44.990]  That's right.
[01:29:44.990 --> 01:29:45.990]  We're going to be back.
[01:29:45.990 --> 01:29:46.990]  And I mean completely.
[01:29:46.990 --> 01:29:50.690]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:29:50.690 --> 01:29:51.970]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.970 --> 01:29:54.510]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.510 --> 01:29:58.230]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:58.230 --> 01:30:05.250]  A staunch anti-federalist, Patrick Henry was opposed to the Constitution, fearing it
[01:30:05.250 --> 01:30:08.830]  would become a monster that would take over not only the sovereign states that had
[01:30:08.830 --> 01:30:12.590]  created it, but that it would become a tool to destroy individual liberty.
[01:30:12.590 --> 01:30:15.190]  His warnings, ignored, have now come to pass.
[01:30:15.190 --> 01:30:19.410]  He said, you're not to inquire how your trade may be increased, nor how you were
[01:30:19.410 --> 01:30:24.110]  to become a great and powerful people, but how your liberties can be secured for
[01:30:24.110 --> 01:30:27.030]  liberty ought to be the direct end of your government.
[01:30:27.030 --> 01:30:31.470]  Patrick Henry warned us the liberties of a people never were nor ever will be secure
[01:30:31.470 --> 01:30:35.270]  when the transactions of their rulers may be concealed from them.
[01:30:35.270 --> 01:30:39.530]  Today, everything the government does at every level is concealed from us.
[01:30:39.530 --> 01:30:43.250]  We have trade deals to manage our economy that not even our elected representatives
[01:30:43.250 --> 01:30:44.550]  are allowed to see.
[01:30:44.550 --> 01:30:47.990]  Later in life, Patrick Henry looked back and said, when the American spirit was in
[01:30:47.990 --> 01:30:50.850]  its youth, the language of America was different.
[01:30:50.850 --> 01:30:52.770]  Liberty, sir, was the primary object.
[01:30:52.770 --> 01:30:58.690]  Today, our primary concern is safety and comfort, when we should be demanding liberty.
[01:30:58.690 --> 01:31:01.090]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.
[01:31:01.090 --> 01:31:05.130]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, also
[01:31:05.130 --> 01:31:10.250]  enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:31:10.250 --> 01:31:14.290]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern
[01:31:14.290 --> 01:31:18.630]  Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:31:18.630 --> 01:31:23.590]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:31:23.590 --> 01:31:30.370]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot blend 100% organic coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[01:31:30.370 --> 01:31:35.430]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn
[01:31:35.430 --> 01:31:37.550]  that so many other coffees give me personally.
[01:31:37.550 --> 01:31:41.790]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections
[01:31:41.790 --> 01:31:44.490]  directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:31:44.490 --> 01:31:49.330]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[01:31:49.330 --> 01:31:53.250]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend, you will be supporting
[01:31:53.250 --> 01:31:59.050]  a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[01:31:59.050 --> 01:32:00.610]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[01:32:00.610 --> 01:32:03.090]  Dr. Group, you developed living defense for us.
[01:32:03.090 --> 01:32:04.450]  It took you over a year to do it.
[01:32:04.450 --> 01:32:06.190]  Why is this so good?
[01:32:06.190 --> 01:32:10.450]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the
[01:32:10.450 --> 01:32:11.450]  most.
[01:32:11.450 --> 01:32:16.310]  I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system,
[01:32:16.310 --> 01:32:21.790]  but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful
[01:32:21.790 --> 01:32:24.590]  to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[01:32:24.590 --> 01:32:29.670]  Right now with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare
[01:32:29.670 --> 01:32:30.950]  going on everywhere.
[01:32:30.950 --> 01:32:31.950]  These are all parasites.
[01:32:31.950 --> 01:32:34.670]  Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it.
[01:32:34.670 --> 01:32:38.990]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[01:32:38.990 --> 01:32:42.250]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[01:32:42.250 --> 01:32:43.250]  All right.
[01:32:43.250 --> 01:32:45.210]  Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[01:32:45.210 --> 01:32:46.610]  It just came back in yesterday.
[01:32:46.610 --> 01:32:48.450]  Living defense, Infowarslife.com.
[01:32:48.450 --> 01:32:49.450]  And folks, you can't lose.
[01:32:49.450 --> 01:32:52.290]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[01:32:52.290 --> 01:32:55.550]  And you support the broadcast, Infowarslife.com.
[01:32:55.550 --> 01:32:57.770]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[01:32:57.770 --> 01:33:06.450]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[01:33:06.450 --> 01:33:35.190]  The Alex Jones Show, because there is a war on, or you're mine.
[01:33:35.190 --> 01:33:49.310]  All right, Dr. Corsi's popping in for about 10 minutes, then we're going to go to your
[01:33:49.310 --> 01:33:52.230]  phone calls right into the next hour.
[01:33:52.230 --> 01:33:58.090]  We have Dr. Mercola joining us with some huge, huge developments on so many fronts
[01:33:58.090 --> 01:34:02.810]  with all these massive studies coming out confirming much of his research and other
[01:34:02.810 --> 01:34:13.910]  researchers, Intel 800-259-9231, 800-259-9231 is a toll free number for you to join us.
[01:34:13.910 --> 01:34:16.010]  I've got some other clips I want to play as well.
[01:34:16.010 --> 01:34:22.370]  Obviously, we just tuned in, you already know about the 22 dead over 50 injured in
[01:34:22.370 --> 01:34:30.250]  a suicide bombing in Manchester, England at a girl's college slash high school level
[01:34:30.250 --> 01:34:33.650]  pop rock concert.
[01:34:33.650 --> 01:34:38.170]  And I'm not even so much angry at Islam because it is what it is.
[01:34:38.170 --> 01:34:40.270]  I'm not mad at the AIDS virus, it is what it is.
[01:34:40.270 --> 01:34:43.950]  I'm not mad at a crocodile that eats a small child, a crocodile is a crocodile.
[01:34:43.950 --> 01:34:48.430]  I'm not mad at a black widow that bites somebody and kills them, it's a black widow.
[01:34:48.430 --> 01:34:53.830]  I'm not mad at a tornado that goes through the neighborhood and kills some people.
[01:34:53.830 --> 01:34:56.010]  That's what tornadoes do.
[01:34:56.010 --> 01:35:02.970]  It's that letting Islamists in from the most radical out of control areas of the world
[01:35:02.970 --> 01:35:08.650]  where they're literally the most bizarre cult the planet's ever seen where women can't
[01:35:08.650 --> 01:35:12.210]  go outside without a male attendant, where women wear total hoods over their heads,
[01:35:12.210 --> 01:35:16.430]  where women can't drive cars, where women can be raped and they report it, they get
[01:35:16.430 --> 01:35:20.730]  charged with a sex crime.
[01:35:20.730 --> 01:35:25.210]  And then to be lectured by feminists all day how I'm a bad Western man when the West
[01:35:25.210 --> 01:35:31.210]  is where women got empowered and where slavery got ended, except in Islamic countries.
[01:35:31.210 --> 01:35:32.850]  Many Islamic countries still have slavery.
[01:35:32.850 --> 01:35:36.450]  People go, well, that's their culture.
[01:35:36.450 --> 01:35:39.310]  Let's all go as liberals to the hookah bar.
[01:35:39.310 --> 01:35:44.650]  So there's this weird liberal fascination with the most radical orthodox forms of Islam.
[01:35:44.650 --> 01:35:49.230]  I know Dr. Corsi worked in counterterrorism with the State Department and other areas
[01:35:49.230 --> 01:35:51.250]  and is an expert on radical Islam.
[01:35:51.250 --> 01:35:54.090]  But that's not why he's about to join us in a moment, but I'm sure he'll be able to
[01:35:54.090 --> 01:35:56.130]  speak to that.
[01:35:56.130 --> 01:36:00.290]  But I'm really mad at the elites that have opened the door up to do this and that would
[01:36:00.290 --> 01:36:01.890]  make an alliance.
[01:36:02.020 --> 01:36:24.590]  With people that absolutely are more barbarous than most cultures were 5000-6000 years ago. I mean modern Islam was formed out of the slave trade and camel caravan routes that came through Mecca.
[01:36:24.610 --> 01:36:34.130]  And is the worst of the worst of the worst of the worst and is absolutely the most criminal,
[01:36:34.130 --> 01:36:38.969]  reprobate, twisted, bizarre rationale for pure evil.
[01:36:38.969 --> 01:36:47.570]  It is the most monotheistic, chauvinistic thing on earth.
[01:36:47.570 --> 01:36:52.049]  I don't like extreme liberalism, I don't like extreme, you know, Islam.
[01:36:52.049 --> 01:36:57.009]  America is like way towards liberalism under Thomas Jefferson and the very liberals then
[01:36:57.009 --> 01:37:02.929]  criticize us all day from a position of ignorance because they get off on the power trip of
[01:37:02.929 --> 01:37:07.250]  thinking hey, here comes Islam, they're the muscle we need.
[01:37:07.250 --> 01:37:12.530]  How many videos have you seen at college campuses where they'll just declare the entire
[01:37:12.530 --> 01:37:16.410]  commons, entire parks are off limits to anybody that's white?
[01:37:16.410 --> 01:37:21.730]  But then you'll notice it's white professors, almost universally, that are leading the
[01:37:21.730 --> 01:37:25.410]  minorities that they're taking over from whitey.
[01:37:25.410 --> 01:37:29.809]  It's classic case of Animal Farm, George Arwell.
[01:37:29.809 --> 01:37:36.610]  And then they'll walk over to camera people that are coming over with cameras and they'll
[01:37:36.610 --> 01:37:40.290]  say get out of here and start shoving him.
[01:37:40.290 --> 01:37:44.769]  And then the man says no and she goes that's it, get me some muscle.
[01:37:44.769 --> 01:37:48.769]  And she goes over and tries to find a big black guy to come over and physically attack
[01:37:48.769 --> 01:37:50.610]  the white guy and the black guy won't even do it.
[01:37:52.049 --> 01:37:57.730]  It's like weird beta women wanting to wage war is what I found, that's what feminism
[01:37:57.730 --> 01:38:04.610]  is, but then they go to the most twisted crazy alpha male, but it's not alpha male,
[01:38:04.610 --> 01:38:07.650]  it's like a weird twisted alpha male.
[01:38:07.650 --> 01:38:14.929]  It's like a little disgruntled twisted chicken necked alpha male, real cowardly and hateful
[01:38:14.929 --> 01:38:19.009]  and oppressive and greedy and backwards and smelly.
[01:38:19.009 --> 01:38:25.570]  And by smelly, I mean just the whole thing, just has a cultural stench to it.
[01:38:25.570 --> 01:38:28.530]  And it's the worst forms of Islam that are taking over Islam.
[01:38:28.530 --> 01:38:32.690]  It always wants to take over any nice city or nice culture or nice art and burn it
[01:38:32.690 --> 01:38:36.530]  down, blow it up, take her by the sports stadium, hang them by their necks.
[01:38:40.290 --> 01:38:42.210]  Yeah, let's play this clip of this, let's back it up.
[01:38:42.769 --> 01:38:44.610]  Yeah, can somebody get me some muscle?
[01:38:45.490 --> 01:38:49.570]  She's attacking him, she's attacking his camera because she's the god now,
[01:38:49.570 --> 01:38:52.370]  she rules, you will submit.
[01:38:52.370 --> 01:38:54.130]  We're going to Dr. Corsi here in just a moment.
[01:38:55.969 --> 01:38:59.889]  Dealing with a total media hysteria over us getting some press passes,
[01:38:59.889 --> 01:39:01.250]  which aren't the reason we're in DC.
[01:39:01.250 --> 01:39:04.929]  We're there for interviews, there for our sources, there for the press club.
[01:39:04.929 --> 01:39:08.690]  Corsi's constantly at the press meetings of the different agencies of Congress,
[01:39:08.690 --> 01:39:10.530]  breaking big news on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
[01:39:11.089 --> 01:39:15.730]  It's almost a hassle for him to go get the things and then go sit there all day hoping
[01:39:15.730 --> 01:39:17.969]  to get a question in when it might take you a month to do it.
[01:39:17.969 --> 01:39:20.690]  But they just keep trying to keep us out of the White House,
[01:39:20.690 --> 01:39:22.690]  this symbol of we're not real news.
[01:39:23.330 --> 01:39:25.969]  So we got the week long press pass, they're flipping out about it.
[01:39:27.490 --> 01:39:29.570]  We're going to talk about that in a moment, but first.
[01:39:29.780 --> 01:39:37.660]  We've had six of our best selling products sold out, some of it for a month, some for
[01:39:37.660 --> 01:39:42.700]  two months, some products for two weeks, and that's not a good thing, but we have such
[01:39:42.700 --> 01:39:45.380]  high quality standards that are at California level.
[01:39:45.570 --> 01:39:52.130]  That almost nobody else can pass, that it's hard to get the ingredients that are 100% pure,
[01:39:52.130 --> 01:39:56.090]  but we always wait until we actually get the pure batches.
[01:39:56.090 --> 01:39:59.809]  So everything is back in now, except DNA Force.
[01:39:59.809 --> 01:40:02.730]  Everything is back in at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:40:02.800 --> 01:40:12.920]  And out of the gates for the Memorial Day Special, we have the Mega Specials. This is undoubtedly
[01:40:12.920 --> 01:40:20.560]  one of the biggest sales we've ever done. Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver, 65% off. I
[01:40:20.560 --> 01:40:28.820]  was saying 50% off. I'm sorry, it's 65% off. We've never done 65, so when I saw that earlier
[01:40:28.820 --> 01:40:34.420]  I said 50 in my own brain. It's a loss leader. We want you to have it. We want you to enjoy
[01:40:34.420 --> 01:40:37.980]  the product. We want you to, a lot of you that haven't ever gone and shopped with us
[01:40:37.980 --> 01:40:41.240]  to support the broadcast, now is the time. More than ever, we're under a free speech
[01:40:41.240 --> 01:40:45.820]  attack. We're being demonized. They're trying to shut us down. Quite frankly, these have
[01:40:45.820 --> 01:40:51.000]  been sold out for a while. We can sell these all at full retail. But I want to
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:55.380]  have a win-win here. I want you to get the Colloidal Silver, 65% off. Supermetal
[01:40:55.420 --> 01:41:01.740]  Vitality, our best seller, 30% off out of the gates, gone for months. Survival Shield, X2,
[01:41:01.740 --> 01:41:12.340]  nascent iodine, back in stock, 40% off. Brainforce, 47% off. Secret 12, 43% off.
[01:41:12.340 --> 01:41:16.940]  Pure organic vitamin B12, mythical bottleman, under the tongue. It's the next best thing to
[01:41:17.940 --> 01:41:27.660]  Knock out, 50% off retail. Unbelievable. All Infowars T-shirts, all 75% off. But that
[01:41:27.660 --> 01:41:35.020]  only runs through next Tuesday. Superblue, high quality fluoride-free toothpaste. Infowarsstore.com,
[01:41:35.020 --> 01:41:39.740]  Infowarslife.com. Read the reviews. Here's one for Supermetal Vitality from Carson.
[01:41:39.740 --> 01:41:43.900]  Totally worth it. I love this product. Many people say they can feel it helped
[01:41:43.900 --> 01:41:47.140]  a couple of days. For me, it took a couple of weeks. After it got in my system,
[01:41:47.140 --> 01:41:52.460]  it was a game changer. If you're on the fence about buying this product, I hope it will help
[01:41:52.460 --> 01:41:58.540]  you in so many ways. Five star review. ZShield, our new product to detoxify heavy metals,
[01:41:58.540 --> 01:42:03.540]  other compounds. It's now available. Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com,
[01:42:03.540 --> 01:42:06.900]  or triple A, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine. And listen,
[01:42:06.900 --> 01:42:12.900]  I get up here and I come off as brash and aggressive because I'm exhausted most of the
[01:42:12.900 --> 01:42:16.900]  time. I'm working till seven, eight, nine, 10 at night because I'm committed to the truth.
[01:42:16.900 --> 01:42:22.460]  Not because I'm even an angel. I fundamentally do not want to be dominated by globalist or by
[01:42:22.460 --> 01:42:27.420]  Islamicist or by anybody else. I have a fighting spirit. I know you have one as well. And it
[01:42:27.420 --> 01:42:32.060]  upsets me to see Muslims attack people on a weekly basis who are innocent. I mean,
[01:42:32.060 --> 01:42:35.860]  if you hate our military, I hate our policies. Why don't you go attack a military base?
[01:42:35.860 --> 01:42:39.860]  Why don't you go attack a police station? I'm not saying do that. I'm just saying
[01:42:39.900 --> 01:42:44.780]  that's called being more chivalrous. And it's fundamentally to see a bunch of weird
[01:42:44.780 --> 01:42:51.780]  leftists defending it and attacking us makes me angry. If you'll just support us and just buy
[01:42:51.780 --> 01:42:58.660]  the products, you get auto-ship, get 10% off, free shipping on orders $50 or more. If you'll
[01:42:58.660 --> 01:43:02.580]  just make the commitment to get great products on a routine basis, that's why auto-ship's good
[01:43:02.580 --> 01:43:05.540]  because I tend to forget my own products. I get them out of the warehouse myself and I'll
[01:43:05.540 --> 01:43:09.940]  run out. So I've actually ordered my own products now online, used auto-ship,
[01:43:09.940 --> 01:43:15.020]  and inforestore.com so I don't forget, works like a charm. Because I'm busy and I'm always
[01:43:15.020 --> 01:43:18.740]  at home, oh, I need some colloidal silver, got a sore throat. Or, oh, I ran out of
[01:43:18.740 --> 01:43:25.860]  secret 12 for my kids or I ran out of my own multivitamin, vitamin, mineral fusion,
[01:43:25.860 --> 01:43:32.660]  fruit punch drink. Get 10% off, sign up for every 42 days, every 60 days, every 30 days,
[01:43:32.700 --> 01:43:39.140]  every 15 days, every 90 days. You can cancel any time, get 10% off. But if you get any of
[01:43:39.140 --> 01:43:41.580]  the Emmerich Essentials personal care products...
[01:43:41.880 --> 01:43:51.120]  It is 20% off what's retail and then it's 25% off when you sign up for auto ship for the
[01:43:51.120 --> 01:43:56.340]  shampoo, the body wash, the sunscreen, the 10 to 1 organic mouthwash.
[01:43:56.340 --> 01:43:58.320]  By the way, this is all organic.
[01:43:58.320 --> 01:44:03.520]  I'm so proud of Emmerich's essentials, but take advantage of the mega Memorial Day sales
[01:44:03.520 --> 01:44:06.620]  for all our veterans and all the patriots out there.
[01:44:06.620 --> 01:44:10.440]  Take advantage of these products and sign up for auto ship and if you don't like it, cancel.
[01:44:10.440 --> 01:44:11.440]  You got 10% off.
[01:44:11.480 --> 01:44:14.000]  You get 25% off with Emmerich's essentials.
[01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:17.720]  InfoWarslive.com or triple A two five three three one three nine.
[01:44:17.720 --> 01:44:23.760]  Now we've got callers from Scotland, callers from Maryland, from Germany, from Indiana,
[01:44:23.760 --> 01:44:26.080]  from all over the country, all over the world.
[01:44:26.080 --> 01:44:28.220]  We're going to go on your phone calls here in a few minutes.
[01:44:28.220 --> 01:44:33.740]  But I wanted to get Dr. Jerome Corsi on with us to give us his first snapshot on
[01:44:33.740 --> 01:44:37.220]  what happened 24 hours after the president's speech in Riyadh.
[01:44:37.220 --> 01:44:43.420]  I thought a bold speech that he called out radical Islam to its face.
[01:44:43.420 --> 01:44:47.460]  And then to see this attack and then ISIS and Al Qaeda saying a lot more coming.
[01:44:47.460 --> 01:44:48.460]  What is the EU thinking?
[01:44:48.460 --> 01:44:53.120]  Dr. Corsi, you're a terrorism expert for those that don't know that they're accelerating
[01:44:53.120 --> 01:44:56.860]  as ISIS gets defeated by Trump and America.
[01:44:56.860 --> 01:44:58.860]  They're admittedly flooding back into Europe.
[01:44:58.860 --> 01:45:00.180]  Europe's letting them back in.
[01:45:00.180 --> 01:45:03.440]  It's admitted they're letting known ISIS fighters back in.
[01:45:03.680 --> 01:45:07.800]  Doesn't that make the UK government and doesn't that make the German government and others
[01:45:07.800 --> 01:45:09.560]  guilty of these attacks?
[01:45:09.560 --> 01:45:10.560]  Absolutely.
[01:45:10.560 --> 01:45:18.080]  I mean, you've got a situation right now where the UK is trying to take control of
[01:45:18.080 --> 01:45:21.160]  its borders back again from the EU.
[01:45:21.160 --> 01:45:27.120]  But if you look at the EU in Brussels, you've got unelected bureaucrats, globalists who
[01:45:27.120 --> 01:45:33.960]  are insisting that all the countries of the EU have open borders and are being inundated
[01:45:33.960 --> 01:45:36.260]  with these refugees.
[01:45:36.260 --> 01:45:43.120]  This attack in London was from, I believe, a Lebanon family of refugees that has come
[01:45:43.120 --> 01:45:45.360]  into the UK.
[01:45:45.360 --> 01:45:52.560]  The UK says there's 3500 known terrorists, radical Islamic terrorists in the UK right
[01:45:52.560 --> 01:45:54.000]  now.
[01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:58.440]  And the laws that they've been operating under really tie the hands of the police from
[01:45:58.440 --> 01:46:00.080]  doing anything to protect the people.
[01:46:00.080 --> 01:46:01.080]  Sure.
[01:46:01.080 --> 01:46:04.800]  And just to be clear, it was being confirmed now of Libyan refugees.
[01:46:04.800 --> 01:46:06.160]  Go ahead.
[01:46:06.160 --> 01:46:07.160]  Libyan refugees.
[01:46:07.160 --> 01:46:08.160]  All right.
[01:46:08.160 --> 01:46:09.160]  Libyan refugees.
[01:46:09.160 --> 01:46:15.520]  Well, I mean, again, Libya has been destroyed by Hillary Clinton when she devastated the
[01:46:15.520 --> 01:46:22.880]  country siding with Al Qaeda terrorists to oust Gaddafi.
[01:46:22.880 --> 01:46:30.520]  The country is degenerated into a terrorist controlled bedlam and people can get out are
[01:46:30.520 --> 01:46:31.520]  getting out.
[01:46:31.520 --> 01:46:35.320]  But the radical Islamic terrorists who get out bring the radical Islamic terror with
[01:46:35.320 --> 01:46:36.320]  them.
[01:46:36.320 --> 01:46:40.800]  And that's the problem we're having right now in the UK and all across Europe.
[01:46:40.800 --> 01:46:47.160]  And it's not going to be resolved by politicians wishing that everyone would just get along
[01:46:47.160 --> 01:46:52.760]  or this Islamophobia, political correctness, because this situation, as Donald Trump is
[01:46:52.760 --> 01:46:59.960]  pointing out in this historic trip, is going to need the cooperation, in fact, a reformation
[01:46:59.960 --> 01:47:07.040]  of Islam in order to reject these radicals and to define that the religion is not encouraging
[01:47:07.040 --> 01:47:08.400]  violence.
[01:47:08.400 --> 01:47:13.960]  That's like a reformation that the various Christian churches went through in the Renaissance
[01:47:13.960 --> 01:47:14.960]  and afterwards.
[01:47:14.960 --> 01:47:17.000]  But it's going to happen.
[01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:21.040]  The Protestant Reformation was a major reformulation.
[01:47:21.040 --> 01:47:23.120]  Where is Islam's Martin Luther?
[01:47:23.120 --> 01:47:25.840]  And meanwhile, we don't just demonize George Soros as usual.
[01:47:25.840 --> 01:47:27.160]  He's the one behind it.
[01:47:27.160 --> 01:47:32.720]  And the UN refugee program with these big, long boats enticing the Libyans to flee
[01:47:32.720 --> 01:47:40.660]  to get on these big 100 foot boats that they then run them into the Italian coast.
[01:47:40.660 --> 01:47:43.280]  It's a huge problem and people die on these boats.
[01:47:43.280 --> 01:47:46.440]  These boats are not stable.
[01:47:46.440 --> 01:47:48.560]  People drown when these boats tip over.
[01:47:48.560 --> 01:47:53.040]  So the EU goes in with Hillary, blows up Libya, then millions start pouring out.
[01:47:53.040 --> 01:47:56.160]  And then we're supposed to just take them all.
[01:47:56.160 --> 01:47:58.160]  The EU wants all of them taken.
[01:47:58.160 --> 01:48:03.840]  The EU says, you get X, Y, Z country, you're going to be allocated so many of them.
[01:48:03.840 --> 01:48:08.080]  And if you want to have a EU passport, you want to be able to have free open borders,
[01:48:08.080 --> 01:48:10.840]  then you take the refugees we're giving you.
[01:48:10.840 --> 01:48:12.200]  And it's just not working out.
[01:48:12.200 --> 01:48:18.040]  I mean, in all these countries, Sweden, Germany, you've got Muslim rapes,
[01:48:18.040 --> 01:48:22.960]  you've got Muslim murders, you've got Muslim no-go zones where the police are
[01:48:22.960 --> 01:48:24.760]  as too dangerous even for the police to go through.
[01:48:24.760 --> 01:48:30.240]  I've got statistics, 90% of shootings in Sweden, Muslims, 82% of Muslims doing the raping.
[01:48:30.240 --> 01:48:34.640]  I mean, they literally, it's like they're from another world.
[01:48:34.640 --> 01:48:38.520]  Well, the whole culture, I mean, the whole culture of this radical Islam,
[01:48:38.520 --> 01:48:40.520]  which is so dramatically anti-women.
[01:48:40.520 --> 01:48:43.960]  I mean, it's always amazed me that the American feminists.
[01:48:43.960 --> 01:48:47.480]  In fact, you can say, I mean, isn't Islam number one about oppressing women?
[01:48:47.480 --> 01:48:50.560]  Isn't that the real heart of Islam?
[01:48:50.560 --> 01:48:56.960]  It's certainly core to the attraction of Islam across the world
[01:48:56.960 --> 01:49:01.240]  and this brutalizing of women is basically medieval.
[01:49:01.240 --> 01:49:05.080]  I mean, the sexual mutilation of girls is horrendous.
[01:49:05.080 --> 01:49:08.360]  The beating of women, the way women are treated.
[01:49:08.360 --> 01:49:12.680]  I mean, if anyone's ever been in the Middle East and actually seen the women
[01:49:12.680 --> 01:49:19.520]  wearing these veils and covered from head to foot, it's a fairly frightening scene
[01:49:19.520 --> 01:49:22.600]  to think of the subjugation of women that are-
[01:49:22.600 --> 01:49:26.440]  Doctor, I see this now at malls in Austin, not just to jibs.
[01:49:26.440 --> 01:49:28.400]  I'm seeing women covered up.
[01:49:28.400 --> 01:49:31.120]  You talk about almost having a heart attack.
[01:49:31.120 --> 01:49:33.400]  Right, I mean, it's a pretty frightening scene.
[01:49:33.400 --> 01:49:36.800]  I mean, because these women are completely subjugated,
[01:49:36.800 --> 01:49:40.080]  they're going to be beaten if they violate any rules.
[01:49:40.080 --> 01:49:43.320]  They can be, you know, divorced.
[01:49:43.320 --> 01:49:46.320]  If they're raped, it's their fault.
[01:49:46.320 --> 01:49:52.080]  The laws of Islam and Sharia law are brutal to women.
[01:49:52.080 --> 01:49:57.680]  And it's impossible for me to understand why feminists support Islam
[01:49:57.680 --> 01:50:00.480]  when it is so horrendously brutal to women.
[01:50:00.480 --> 01:50:03.160]  And, you know, this is where the Reformation is needed.
[01:50:03.160 --> 01:50:08.000]  You saw, you know, when President Trump was in Saudi Arabia,
[01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:12.080]  Melania Trump and Ivanka Trump did not wear headscarves.
[01:50:12.080 --> 01:50:15.720]  This was revolutionary in the Islamic world.
[01:50:15.720 --> 01:50:18.120]  These changes have got to happen.
[01:50:18.120 --> 01:50:24.040]  Islam's going to have to allow women to be treated as human beings
[01:50:24.040 --> 01:50:29.880]  and ultimately equals of men because this is fundamental to the way the earth is
[01:50:29.880 --> 01:50:33.200]  and cultures have evolved to a higher level.
[01:50:33.200 --> 01:50:35.880]  But I was about to say, I've studied anthropology, so have you.
[01:50:35.880 --> 01:50:38.640]  Most cultures didn't oppress women ever like this.
[01:50:38.640 --> 01:50:40.000]  A lot of cultures, women ran things.
[01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:44.840]  I mean, this is just, you know, I don't want folks to think that societies
[01:50:44.840 --> 01:50:47.880]  two, three thousand years ago treated women like this on average.
[01:50:47.880 --> 01:50:51.280]  I mean, what Muslims do today in orthodox Muslim countries
[01:50:51.280 --> 01:50:53.200]  is the worst treatment of women in history.
[01:50:53.200 --> 01:50:55.800]  I mean, don't you agree with that historically?
[01:50:56.640 --> 01:50:59.280]  We'll be right back to get more on with him.
[01:50:59.280 --> 01:51:01.160]  Stay with us. This audio cut out.
[01:51:01.160 --> 01:51:05.640]  It's been said any society is only three missed meals away from chaos.
[01:51:05.640 --> 01:51:08.040]  Those times may be near. Think about it.
[01:51:08.040 --> 01:51:11.600]  Our country faces multiple terrorist threats and aggressions from Russia
[01:51:11.600 --> 01:51:14.520]  and North Korea. Social unrest and violent marches
[01:51:14.520 --> 01:51:17.680]  yet again may lead to looting of stores and city shutdowns.
[01:51:17.680 --> 01:51:20.640]  And a crumbling infrastructure leaves our power grid vulnerable
[01:51:20.640 --> 01:51:23.560]  to long term outages from a single cyber attack.
[01:51:23.560 --> 01:51:26.040]  When the chaos from any one of these threats arises,
[01:51:26.040 --> 01:51:27.960]  the government knows it can't provide
[01:51:27.960 --> 01:51:30.240]  during a widespread national emergency.
[01:51:30.240 --> 01:51:33.240]  That's why you need your own plan for self-reliance.
[01:51:33.240 --> 01:51:36.080]  That's where My Patriot Supply comes in.

[01:53:59.130 --> 01:54:21.250]  Okay, Terrence in Scotland, Jason in Germany, O'Brien, Dan, Cindy, we're going to go to
[01:54:21.250 --> 01:54:22.250]  all of you here.
[01:54:22.250 --> 01:54:23.890]  Dr. Kors, he's our guest right now.
[01:54:23.890 --> 01:54:27.610]  The main reason I got him on this morning is we were approached by folks in the White
[01:54:27.610 --> 01:54:32.050]  House at the inauguration saying, hey, who's your White House correspondent going to be?
[01:54:32.050 --> 01:54:34.850]  And they already thought I had a D.C. office and I'm like, no, we've got to get a D.C.
[01:54:34.850 --> 01:54:35.850]  office.
[01:54:35.850 --> 01:54:36.850]  I don't know if I'm going to do it.
[01:54:36.850 --> 01:54:40.590]  The media took that and ran and said, oh, Jones says he's getting them, but he doesn't
[01:54:40.590 --> 01:54:41.590]  have them.
[01:54:41.590 --> 01:54:42.870]  You've got to have an office.
[01:54:42.870 --> 01:54:44.290]  You've got to have a driver's license there.
[01:54:44.290 --> 01:54:45.690]  Well, we got a weekly pass.
[01:54:45.690 --> 01:54:47.610]  Kors, he's had stuff like this before.
[01:54:47.610 --> 01:54:49.250]  He's got congressional passes.
[01:54:49.250 --> 01:54:50.970]  He's covered the campaigns.
[01:54:50.970 --> 01:54:52.650]  He's one of the top political pundits in the country.
[01:54:52.650 --> 01:54:54.290]  Everybody knows that.
[01:54:54.290 --> 01:54:57.450]  And so he got around to getting it.
[01:54:58.290 --> 01:55:02.490]  When the whole hell broke loose, some publications tried to imply we were lying and he wasn't
[01:55:02.490 --> 01:55:04.070]  even there.
[01:55:04.070 --> 01:55:07.530]  The truth is most days there's not even a reason to be there because the president's
[01:55:07.530 --> 01:55:08.770]  gone right now anyway.
[01:55:08.770 --> 01:55:11.370]  So this is Korsy that broke three months ago.
[01:55:11.370 --> 01:55:13.850]  They're stealing the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac money.
[01:55:13.850 --> 01:55:17.250]  Mnuchin confirmed that three weeks ago and we got credit.
[01:55:17.250 --> 01:55:18.530]  Most of the meetings don't happen at briefings.
[01:55:18.530 --> 01:55:22.090]  They happen at dinners like he was at one with the vice president a few nights ago.
[01:55:22.090 --> 01:55:23.570]  Maybe I'm not supposed to say that.
[01:55:23.570 --> 01:55:26.930]  The point is you've been friends with Donald Trump for 40 years.
[01:55:26.930 --> 01:55:30.410]  These guys were at the tower just four or five months ago together.
[01:55:30.410 --> 01:55:32.850]  They act like we're not real media.
[01:55:32.850 --> 01:55:34.330]  We're begging for press passes.
[01:55:34.330 --> 01:55:39.170]  Sure, low levels trying to block us, but they failed.
[01:55:39.170 --> 01:55:47.770]  It also is amazing to me the Twitters, I've been blocking these Twitters, just vile, vile
[01:55:47.770 --> 01:55:48.770]  comments.
[01:55:48.770 --> 01:55:53.650]  I mean, people, irrational and I look at these adult women, you look at the pictures
[01:55:53.650 --> 01:55:56.650]  of them and it's just a string of swear words.
[01:55:56.650 --> 01:55:57.650]  Temper tantrums.
[01:55:57.650 --> 01:56:01.370]  Yeah, and I think these people have lost their minds.
[01:56:01.370 --> 01:56:11.650]  I mean, the insults and the, completely without any knowledge base at all saying that
[01:56:11.650 --> 01:56:17.170]  we are destroying the news media because we've gotten press credentials at the White
[01:56:17.170 --> 01:56:18.170]  House.
[01:56:18.170 --> 01:56:24.050]  I mean, this type of thing is just a censorship again and on the left and an intolerance.
[01:56:24.050 --> 01:56:29.610]  You know, if you don't take their story and look at the views their way, then the
[01:56:29.610 --> 01:56:31.890]  left goes so berserk, they want to almost do violence.
[01:56:31.890 --> 01:56:32.890]  Well, sure.
[01:56:32.890 --> 01:56:35.290]  Let me apologize that we did boost the stock market last week.
[01:56:35.290 --> 01:56:36.930]  The stock exchange heads confirmed it.
[01:56:36.930 --> 01:56:37.930]  I'm so sorry.
[01:56:37.930 --> 01:56:41.930]  And, you know, you did break the giant story that's now all over the news about the looting
[01:56:41.930 --> 01:56:45.750]  of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, of $300 billion of taxpayer money and investors' money,
[01:56:45.750 --> 01:56:47.570]  and the president is now reversing it.
[01:56:47.570 --> 01:56:49.370]  So how dare us being so fake?
[01:56:49.370 --> 01:56:52.610]  You know, the truth is you have a degree in international finance.
[01:56:52.610 --> 01:56:56.730]  You're a top banking expert, you're a top journalist, and they're scared of you.
[01:56:56.730 --> 01:57:01.410]  Well, you know, I've been at this a long time and I've had press credentials.
[01:57:01.410 --> 01:57:08.730]  I traveled as traveling press with George Romney the last three weeks of the 2012 presidential
[01:57:08.730 --> 01:57:09.730]  campaign.
[01:57:09.730 --> 01:57:13.930]  I've attended any number of presidential speeches.
[01:57:13.930 --> 01:57:20.770]  I've seen in person every president back to Dwight Eisenhower, even saw Harry Truman
[01:57:20.770 --> 01:57:21.770]  as a child.
[01:57:21.770 --> 01:57:26.330]  I mean, I've seen every one of them and known very many of them.
[01:57:26.330 --> 01:57:31.130]  I've been at this for a long time and, you know, my Ph.D. in political science
[01:57:31.130 --> 01:57:36.930]  as well as 25 years old, I spent 25 years in international finance, and I've worked
[01:57:36.930 --> 01:57:42.070]  around the world, creating, working with banks, working with finance companies at top
[01:57:42.070 --> 01:57:43.810]  security clearances.
[01:57:43.810 --> 01:57:48.370]  I broke any number of stories, I've written six New York Times best selling books, two
[01:57:48.370 --> 01:57:49.850]  of them were number one.
[01:57:49.850 --> 01:57:54.850]  How about three were number one?
[01:57:54.850 --> 01:57:58.850]  When you count that, I ghost wrote one that was number one.
[01:57:58.850 --> 01:58:01.890]  Under my own name, I have two number one.
[01:58:01.890 --> 01:58:08.490]  I have the Abomination and Unfit for Command, but I've, you know, I've had six New York
[01:58:08.490 --> 01:58:09.490]  Times best sellers.
[01:58:09.490 --> 01:58:15.450]  I've written 20 books since 2004 and I've been published in international journals.
[01:58:15.450 --> 01:58:20.730]  I mean, it's been all over and it's extensive and the mainstream media doesn't want to
[01:58:20.730 --> 01:58:21.730]  acknowledge it.
[01:58:21.730 --> 01:58:27.410]  Well, it's just so crazy how they keep trying to brand us as fake news when it
[01:58:27.410 --> 01:58:31.290]  isn't that we're in the White House that we're real news, it's that they follow
[01:58:31.290 --> 01:58:32.290]  us.
[01:58:32.290 --> 01:58:33.730]  I mean, we're the ones breaking the big news.
[01:58:33.730 --> 01:58:35.530]  We're the ones that have the contacts.
[01:58:35.530 --> 01:58:36.650]  We're the ones that have the guest.
[01:58:36.650 --> 01:58:41.570]  I mean, I just had the guy on from the peace rally in Manchester an hour ago.
[01:58:41.570 --> 01:58:43.010]  We're going to come back with Dr.
[01:58:43.010 --> 01:58:44.010]  Christian.
[01:58:44.010 --> 01:58:45.010]  Your phone calls.
[01:58:45.010 --> 01:58:46.010]  Thanks for holding.
[01:58:46.010 --> 01:58:47.970]  Third hour is about to begin.
[01:58:47.970 --> 01:58:51.770]  It's an act of rebellion to spread the link info wars dot com.
[01:58:51.770 --> 01:58:53.490]  Today we call it bone broth.
[01:58:53.490 --> 01:58:57.730]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost
[01:58:57.730 --> 01:59:00.050]  to our modern diets of processed junk.
[01:59:00.050 --> 01:59:03.210]  We are now introducing Caveman by info wars live dot com.
[01:59:03.210 --> 01:59:08.330]  The ultimate and true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root chaga mushroom
[01:59:08.330 --> 01:59:12.970]  and seven total primal superfoods in a single great tasting formula.
[01:59:12.970 --> 01:59:13.970]  Caveman.
[01:59:13.970 --> 01:59:17.770]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our
[01:59:17.770 --> 01:59:18.770]  superior ancestors.
[01:59:18.770 --> 01:59:21.450]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[01:59:21.450 --> 01:59:25.810]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal, you use the meat for sustenance,
[01:59:25.810 --> 01:59:30.810]  the fat for cooking, but you use the bones for strength for the outside structure
[01:59:30.810 --> 01:59:35.010]  full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body.
[01:59:35.010 --> 01:59:37.530]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[01:59:37.530 --> 01:59:41.650]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get
[01:59:41.650 --> 01:59:44.170]  back to that essence that made us what we were.
[01:59:44.170 --> 01:59:45.530]  And this is a big part of it.
[01:59:45.530 --> 01:59:49.050]  I know you're going to want to check out caveman, ultimate paleo formula for yourself
[01:59:49.050 --> 01:59:53.450]  and forest life.com today.
[01:59:53.450 --> 01:59:56.010]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:59:58.550 --> 02:00:11.550]  Everybody can hear the excitement in my voice, the fact that I'm so earnest.
[02:00:11.550 --> 02:00:15.550]  I like that in person.
[02:00:15.550 --> 02:00:20.550]  Rallying Patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[02:00:20.550 --> 02:00:23.550]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:23.550 --> 02:00:27.550]  But I get in here and do hours of preparation at home and then here at the office
[02:00:27.550 --> 02:00:30.550]  and work into the evening many days and on the weekends
[02:00:30.550 --> 02:00:35.550]  just looking at the globalists announcing the end of humanity
[02:00:35.550 --> 02:00:38.550]  and genetic engineering and bringing in the Islamicists
[02:00:38.550 --> 02:00:41.550]  and ending free market and they're just horrible people
[02:00:41.550 --> 02:00:45.550]  are selling baby parts and it's just like, no!
[02:00:45.550 --> 02:00:47.550]  And I'm just here ringing the alarm.
[02:00:47.550 --> 02:00:50.550]  Does it mean the alarm sometimes has a pretty sound to it?
[02:00:50.550 --> 02:00:52.550]  No, but it's getting the job done.
[02:00:52.550 --> 02:00:56.550]  We are all Paul Revere's in the fight to awaken humanity
[02:00:56.550 --> 02:00:58.550]  and I salute you all.
[02:00:58.550 --> 02:01:01.550]  Let's go to taking calls here with Dr. Corsi.
[02:01:01.550 --> 02:01:03.550]  Let's talk to Terence in Scotland.
[02:01:03.550 --> 02:01:05.550]  Terence, thank you for holding.
[02:01:05.550 --> 02:01:07.550]  You want to talk about UK cuckolding
[02:01:07.550 --> 02:01:11.550]  or the way that they've taken folks that were historically not easy to roll over.
[02:01:11.550 --> 02:01:13.550]  Even the Romans couldn't conquer that area.
[02:01:13.550 --> 02:01:18.550]  But now just love to be slaves. What's happened?
[02:01:18.550 --> 02:01:21.550]  First off, Alex, it was an absolute pleasure to be on this show
[02:01:21.550 --> 02:01:26.550]  and under given circumstances, I wish it was under happier circumstances.
[02:01:26.550 --> 02:01:30.550]  Yes, I'm very sad about the dead young girls, particularly sickening.
[02:01:30.550 --> 02:01:33.550]  Yes, even though I live up here in Aberdeen,
[02:01:33.550 --> 02:01:36.550]  actually not too far from Donald Trump's lovely golf course,
[02:01:36.550 --> 02:01:39.550]  I lived in Manchester for eight years as a student
[02:01:39.550 --> 02:01:42.550]  and as a doctor working in the local hospitals there.
[02:01:42.550 --> 02:01:44.550]  So it's a home from home.
[02:01:44.550 --> 02:01:49.550]  And I tell you what, after the attack in Westminster Bridge last month,
[02:01:49.550 --> 02:01:52.550]  I no longer feel shocked. I no longer feel upset.
[02:01:52.550 --> 02:01:57.550]  I am seething with anger right now, just how inept,
[02:01:57.550 --> 02:02:02.550]  not just your leaders and of course your Senate and Congress are acting,
[02:02:02.550 --> 02:02:05.550]  but our leaders here, not just in the UK, but in Europe,
[02:02:05.550 --> 02:02:09.550]  are dealing with this problem with the migrant crisis right now.
[02:02:09.550 --> 02:02:12.550]  Well, they even preempted the terror attack news last night
[02:02:12.550 --> 02:02:15.550]  running Trump on the ground saying he asked intelligence chiefs,
[02:02:15.550 --> 02:02:17.550]  you know, to tell the public he wasn't a Russian
[02:02:17.550 --> 02:02:19.550]  because they all have the intel he's not a Russian agent.
[02:02:19.550 --> 02:02:21.550]  That was in the news three months ago.
[02:02:21.550 --> 02:02:25.550]  Now it's like breaking. He obstructed justice with other leaders.
[02:02:25.550 --> 02:02:28.550]  No, he didn't. He publicly said they have the intel.
[02:02:28.550 --> 02:02:31.550]  Release it. He is president, I guess could.
[02:02:31.550 --> 02:02:34.550]  He doesn't want to damage intelligence. He has it all.
[02:02:34.550 --> 02:02:37.550]  He knows Hillary is a Chinese agent on the Russian payroll.
[02:02:37.550 --> 02:02:39.550]  And you're absolutely right.
[02:02:39.550 --> 02:02:43.550]  You know, it's just frustrating to see them out to get Trump,
[02:02:43.550 --> 02:02:46.550]  out to get nationalism, out to try to stop your government
[02:02:46.550 --> 02:02:50.550]  finally trying to control its borders, wanting the UK to commit suicide.
[02:02:50.550 --> 02:02:55.550]  Where do you think this is all going as a medical doctor there in Scotland?
[02:02:55.550 --> 02:02:59.550]  Well, first off, in terms of the nationalist wave sweeping,
[02:02:59.550 --> 02:03:03.550]  not just the states, worldwide, and it's hitting Western Europe hard.
[02:03:03.550 --> 02:03:07.550]  Ignore what the lamestream media is saying about, you know,
[02:03:07.550 --> 02:03:12.550]  nationalism dying, taking, you know, a hit to the head with Macron,
[02:03:12.550 --> 02:03:16.550]  with Gert Bilderse, and of course, you know, what happened in Austria earlier in the year.
[02:03:16.550 --> 02:03:18.550]  That is absolute bull.
[02:03:18.550 --> 02:03:20.550]  Oh, we know they're stealing the elections.
[02:03:20.550 --> 02:03:24.550]  Yeah, it's not just stealing the elections. They forget to actually look at the numbers.
[02:03:24.550 --> 02:03:28.550]  If we just look at, for example, the Netherlands, you know, the elections there,
[02:03:28.550 --> 02:03:31.550]  they said, oh, Gert Bilderse, he didn't win all of his seats,
[02:03:31.550 --> 02:03:33.550]  but he got an improvement, and guess what?
[02:03:33.550 --> 02:03:36.550]  The center-left parties got annihilated.
[02:03:36.550 --> 02:03:40.550]  That's right. The center-left and leftist parties are becoming extinct.
[02:03:40.550 --> 02:03:43.550]  They're having to now pose as kind of nationalist-lite.
[02:03:43.550 --> 02:03:46.550]  That'll only work for one season. What an amazing lesion.
[02:03:46.550 --> 02:03:49.550]  It's so good to have great callers like you, Terrence. Anything else?
[02:03:49.550 --> 02:03:54.550]  Yes. First off, you know, as someone once said,
[02:03:54.550 --> 02:03:57.550]  these changes, unfortunately, may not happen in one cycle,
[02:03:57.550 --> 02:04:00.550]  and you hit the hammer right, you know, you hit the nail on the head, Alex.
[02:04:00.550 --> 02:04:03.550]  It's a two-cycle process, so give Europe a chance.
[02:04:03.550 --> 02:04:08.550]  By the next election cycles, nationalism will take over.
[02:04:09.550 --> 02:04:13.550]  And I want to finish off with just a glowing endorsement of your products.
[02:04:13.550 --> 02:04:19.550]  Wearing off of the extremely extortionate customs taxes that the EU has put on American goods.
[02:04:19.550 --> 02:04:22.550]  For example, if I were to want to buy Californian wine,
[02:04:22.550 --> 02:04:25.550]  I have to pay a 19% surcharge on your stuff.
[02:04:25.550 --> 02:04:28.550]  If I want to buy what I want, which is a Ford Mustang,
[02:04:28.550 --> 02:04:32.550]  I have to pay 34% custom tax on it. That's ridiculous.
[02:04:32.550 --> 02:04:36.550]  Anyway, going about your products, love the water filters.
[02:04:36.550 --> 02:04:40.550]  I bought two Propio water filters for my mum, dad, and of course myself.
[02:04:40.550 --> 02:04:44.550]  Excellent stuff. And of course, super blue toothpaste.
[02:04:44.550 --> 02:04:47.550]  It's fantastic. Just don't mention my sister, who's a dentist.
[02:04:47.550 --> 02:04:49.550]  She's a flow-eyed advocate. I don't listen to her.
[02:04:49.550 --> 02:04:51.550]  So, there you go. Love your products.
[02:04:51.550 --> 02:04:52.550]  Well, God bless you for the plugs.
[02:04:52.550 --> 02:04:55.550]  Yeah, that's what Trump's mad about, is these tariffs on America are just insane,
[02:04:55.550 --> 02:04:57.550]  and they hurt consumers in the UK.
[02:04:57.550 --> 02:04:59.550]  God bless you, Terrence. Thanks for the support.
[02:05:06.550 --> 02:05:08.550]  ...a creator with certain unalienable rights,
[02:05:08.550 --> 02:05:12.550]  that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[02:05:12.550 --> 02:05:15.550]  That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men,
[02:05:15.550 --> 02:05:19.550]  deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.
[02:05:19.550 --> 02:05:22.550]  That whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends,
[02:05:22.550 --> 02:05:26.550]  it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it,
[02:05:26.550 --> 02:05:29.550]  and to institute new government.
[02:05:29.550 --> 02:05:33.550]  Independence isn't a day. It's a mindset, an attitude that says,
[02:05:34.550 --> 02:05:37.550]  I will not be your dependent. I will not be your slave.
[02:05:37.550 --> 02:05:43.550]  Dependence and slavery is a chain that is forged link by link with gradual infringements.
[02:05:43.550 --> 02:05:48.550]  When you trade your liberty for safety, to that extent, you become their slave.
[02:05:48.550 --> 02:05:53.550]  Slaves are never safe. You won't get rich by being a slave.
[02:05:53.550 --> 02:05:54.550]  Guard your liberty.
[02:05:54.550 --> 02:05:57.550]  Regard with suspicion anyone who tries to take it.
[02:05:57.550 --> 02:06:00.550]  For empowars.com, I'm David Knight.
[02:06:00.550 --> 02:06:03.550]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together
[02:06:03.550 --> 02:06:08.550]  with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems
[02:06:08.550 --> 02:06:11.550]  that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[02:06:11.550 --> 02:06:13.550]  That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield.
[02:06:13.550 --> 02:06:16.550]  Toxic metal and chemical defense support.
[02:06:16.550 --> 02:06:17.550]  It's made in the USA.
[02:06:17.550 --> 02:06:20.550]  It's filled with known compounds from nature
[02:06:20.550 --> 02:06:23.550]  that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body,
[02:06:23.550 --> 02:06:24.550]  and it supports the inform.
[02:06:24.550 --> 02:06:26.550]  It is a classical 360 win.
[02:06:26.550 --> 02:06:30.550]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year,
[02:06:30.550 --> 02:06:33.550]  and now we believe we have come as close to perfection
[02:06:33.550 --> 02:06:36.550]  when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[02:06:36.550 --> 02:06:38.550]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family,
[02:06:38.550 --> 02:06:41.550]  and you owe it to the future of this country and the world
[02:06:41.550 --> 02:06:45.550]  that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be
[02:06:45.550 --> 02:06:48.550]  because we need you, the remnant of America,
[02:06:48.550 --> 02:06:51.550]  to reignite those brush fires to the next level
[02:06:51.550 --> 02:06:53.550]  and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[02:06:53.550 --> 02:06:56.550]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together we're changing the world.
[02:06:56.550 --> 02:06:57.550]  Now it's time to change our bodies.
[02:06:57.550 --> 02:07:00.550]  With Z-Field and infullwarslife.com.
[02:07:00.550 --> 02:07:02.550]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[02:07:02.550 --> 02:07:04.550]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[02:07:04.550 --> 02:07:07.550]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[02:07:07.550 --> 02:07:13.550]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[02:07:13.550 --> 02:07:15.550]  The same team based right here in America
[02:07:15.550 --> 02:07:19.550]  that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems
[02:07:19.550 --> 02:07:22.550]  have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze.
[02:07:22.550 --> 02:07:25.550]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers,
[02:07:25.550 --> 02:07:29.550]  your family, your children to do the best job you can to purify your air.
[02:07:29.550 --> 02:07:32.550]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment
[02:07:32.550 --> 02:07:37.550]  while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[02:07:37.550 --> 02:07:39.550]  The general public doesn't.
[02:07:39.550 --> 02:07:43.550]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[02:07:43.550 --> 02:07:47.550]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[02:07:47.550 --> 02:07:50.550]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house,
[02:07:50.550 --> 02:07:54.550]  replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[02:07:54.550 --> 02:07:58.550]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:08:11.550 --> 02:08:16.550]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:16.550 --> 02:08:21.550]  I used to be such a sweet sweet thing till they got a glory
[02:08:21.550 --> 02:08:24.550]  Yeah, I got no friends cause they can read the papers.
[02:08:28.550 --> 02:08:31.550]  It's crazy to actually be living in an Alice Cooper song. Crank it up.
[02:08:31.550 --> 02:08:35.550]  I got no friends cause they read the papers
[02:08:35.550 --> 02:08:39.550]  There can't be a scene with me
[02:08:39.550 --> 02:08:41.550]  And I'm here to read the papers
[02:08:41.550 --> 02:08:44.550]  You know though, this hit 30 years ago when the newspapers were all lying about you, it would destroy you.
[02:08:44.550 --> 02:08:46.550]  Imagine how bad it was back then
[02:08:46.550 --> 02:08:48.550]  Now a lot of folks know they're a bunch of liars
[02:08:48.550 --> 02:08:52.550]  But I tell you, they tell such intense lies sometimes
[02:08:52.550 --> 02:08:54.550]  I read it and I go, did I really do that?
[02:08:54.550 --> 02:08:56.550]  Then I go research it and I didn't do it
[02:08:56.550 --> 02:08:58.550]  My mom called up a couple months cause she goes
[02:08:58.550 --> 02:09:02.550]  Did you say Hillary was in a basement murdering and torturing kids to death?
[02:09:02.550 --> 02:09:04.550]  And I went, no mom.
[02:09:04.550 --> 02:09:06.550]  And then I went and saw what Megyn Kelly had said
[02:09:06.550 --> 02:09:08.550]  And then I went and pulled up the actual show
[02:09:08.550 --> 02:09:11.550]  And I said, I don't know if she's killing kids in these basements
[02:09:11.550 --> 02:09:14.550]  I know there's a lot of weird stuff going on in the WikiLeaks
[02:09:14.550 --> 02:09:18.550]  But I said, I sure know that she funded radical Islam
[02:09:18.550 --> 02:09:20.550]  Running around selling kids into sex slavery
[02:09:20.550 --> 02:09:23.550]  Murdering women, hundreds of thousands dead
[02:09:23.550 --> 02:09:27.550]  Libya, Syria, overthrowing our allies in Egypt
[02:09:27.550 --> 02:09:29.550]  So I said, she's guilty of that
[02:09:29.550 --> 02:09:32.550]  The 500,000 dead kids in the Clinton administration
[02:09:32.550 --> 02:09:37.550]  Increasing sanctions like five times even what George Herbert Walker Bush did
[02:09:37.550 --> 02:09:40.550]  So yeah, she's guilty of that
[02:09:40.550 --> 02:09:44.550]  They edited it and said that I said she was doing it
[02:09:46.550 --> 02:09:48.550]  That's how sophisticated the media is
[02:09:48.550 --> 02:09:51.550]  They go, oh, you ran a report about something at a pizza place
[02:09:51.550 --> 02:09:53.550]  I'm like, oh yeah, that's somebody else's report
[02:09:53.550 --> 02:09:55.550]  I'll retract that
[02:09:55.550 --> 02:09:58.550]  Then they go, oh, he retracted that Hillary was killing people in a basement
[02:09:58.550 --> 02:10:03.550]  See, they use a retraction to put things onto it you didn't say or you didn't do
[02:10:03.550 --> 02:10:06.550]  And now I'm like, oh, I can't ever retract anything again
[02:10:06.550 --> 02:10:08.550]  Cause they'll misrepresent what I retracted
[02:10:09.550 --> 02:10:12.550]  Which regular news does retractions every day
[02:10:12.550 --> 02:10:14.550]  We've done like three in 22 years
[02:10:14.550 --> 02:10:18.550]  So not just no more Mr. Nice Guy
[02:10:18.550 --> 02:10:19.550]  I guess we can't do retractions
[02:10:19.550 --> 02:10:23.550]  We have to have like legal agreements where you can't say a retraction was for this or that
[02:10:23.550 --> 02:10:25.550]  Where you just make up a bunch of stuff
[02:10:25.550 --> 02:10:29.550]  That's why I've challenged Shabani to put out the settlement
[02:10:29.550 --> 02:10:31.550]  They had the media everywhere say I paid him a bunch of money
[02:10:31.550 --> 02:10:33.550]  That's not true
[02:10:33.550 --> 02:10:35.550]  Not a bunch, not a
[02:10:35.550 --> 02:10:37.550]  I've signed an agreement where I can't say anything
[02:10:37.550 --> 02:10:41.550]  I wish I could tell you which way the money was going here
[02:10:41.550 --> 02:10:43.550]  And I'm real tempted about breaking the agreement
[02:10:43.550 --> 02:10:47.550]  Cause they, I believe, did it with newspapers putting out this info
[02:10:47.550 --> 02:10:49.550]  In fact, my lawyers are sure of it, they have sources
[02:10:49.550 --> 02:10:55.550]  But let's just say DC and places are a very small community
[02:10:55.550 --> 02:10:57.550]  So we've got Dr. Mercola coming up in a few minutes
[02:10:57.550 --> 02:10:59.550]  I apologize for having to move him an hour and move him late
[02:10:59.550 --> 02:11:02.550]  With the terror attack though, obviously big things are happening
[02:11:02.550 --> 02:11:04.550]  But the reason I wanted to get him on
[02:11:04.550 --> 02:11:06.550]  Even though there was a terror attack obviously yesterday
[02:11:06.550 --> 02:11:09.550]  And most hosts would cancel a piece on wellness
[02:11:09.550 --> 02:11:12.550]  Is this is something we can do something about
[02:11:12.550 --> 02:11:13.550]  But I want to be clear
[02:11:13.550 --> 02:11:15.550]  I'm not even an enemy of Islam
[02:11:15.550 --> 02:11:18.550]  I'm really upset by the globalist social engineers
[02:11:18.550 --> 02:11:21.550]  Trying to bring in this incompatible group to our country
[02:11:21.550 --> 02:11:25.550]  And then using the terror attacks to take our freedoms
[02:11:25.550 --> 02:11:29.550]  That's really why the western elites are bringing this in
[02:11:29.550 --> 02:11:31.550]  And the left uses their foot soldiers
[02:11:31.550 --> 02:11:33.550]  But Dr. Corsi, I'm gonna go to
[02:11:33.550 --> 02:11:35.550]  After you're gone here with Mercola
[02:11:35.550 --> 02:11:37.550]  It's a little bit all over the map but it's okay
[02:11:37.550 --> 02:11:39.550]  Jason in Germany and Devin and Trevor
[02:11:39.550 --> 02:11:41.550]  And Cindy and a few others
[02:11:41.550 --> 02:11:43.550]  And then I'm gonna go to Mercola here in just a few minutes
[02:11:43.550 --> 02:11:45.550]  With this new book that we sell
[02:11:45.550 --> 02:11:47.550]  At info.restore.com that's been highly anticipated
[02:11:47.550 --> 02:11:49.550]  And it's a game changer
[02:11:49.550 --> 02:11:51.550]  But just closing comments about what we've seen
[02:11:51.550 --> 02:11:53.550]  What we've witnessed
[02:11:53.550 --> 02:11:55.550]  And the state of the Trump administration right now
[02:11:55.550 --> 02:11:57.550]  Well I think the Trump administration
[02:11:57.550 --> 02:11:59.550]  Is gonna be dramatically benefited by this press
[02:11:59.550 --> 02:12:01.550]  Let's face it
[02:12:01.550 --> 02:12:03.550]  This is the first time that the world has seen
[02:12:03.550 --> 02:12:05.550]  Trump on the world stage
[02:12:05.550 --> 02:12:09.550]  And I think they're getting a very very favorable image
[02:12:09.550 --> 02:12:11.550]  He shined on it didn't he?
[02:12:11.550 --> 02:12:13.550]  He looked really good
[02:12:13.550 --> 02:12:15.550]  He looked terrific and the speeches have been
[02:12:15.550 --> 02:12:17.550]  Extremely well received
[02:12:17.550 --> 02:12:19.550]  I mean there's no president who's gone
[02:12:19.550 --> 02:12:21.550]  To the three major religions
[02:12:21.550 --> 02:12:25.550]  The site of Islam
[02:12:25.550 --> 02:12:29.550]  Saudi Arabia which protects the two most sacred
[02:12:29.550 --> 02:12:31.550]  Geographical sites in Islam
[02:12:31.550 --> 02:12:33.550]  He's gone now to Israel
[02:12:33.550 --> 02:12:35.550]  And met with the Jewish state
[02:12:35.550 --> 02:12:37.550]  Now he's headed
[02:12:37.550 --> 02:12:39.550]  Today he's in the Vatican
[02:12:39.550 --> 02:12:41.550]  He will be meeting with the Pope tomorrow
[02:12:41.550 --> 02:12:43.550]  At three major religions
[02:12:43.550 --> 02:12:45.550]  Asked to come together
[02:12:45.550 --> 02:12:47.550]  To responsibly combat
[02:12:47.550 --> 02:12:49.550]  These radicals
[02:12:49.550 --> 02:12:51.550]  And Islam wants to say
[02:12:51.550 --> 02:12:53.550]  Well if they're terrorists they're not Islam
[02:12:53.550 --> 02:12:55.550]  Fine well then let's make sure
[02:12:55.550 --> 02:12:57.550]  We redefine Islam
[02:12:57.550 --> 02:12:59.550]  Had to go through a reformation
[02:12:59.550 --> 02:13:01.550]  So we can come out of this
[02:13:01.550 --> 02:13:03.550]  With a resolve
[02:13:03.550 --> 02:13:05.550]  Across all three religions
[02:13:05.550 --> 02:13:07.550]  That we're gonna do things like
[02:13:07.550 --> 02:13:09.550]  Destroy ISIS not just
[02:13:09.550 --> 02:13:11.550]  Denigrate or wear it down
[02:13:11.550 --> 02:13:13.550]  But to destroy it
[02:13:13.550 --> 02:13:15.550]  To destroy Al Qaeda
[02:13:15.550 --> 02:13:17.550]  To destroy these terrorist groups
[02:13:17.550 --> 02:13:19.550]  And make sure that Iran
[02:13:19.550 --> 02:13:21.550]  Does not get nuclear weapons
[02:13:21.550 --> 02:13:23.550]  And by the way I think North Korea is gonna be
[02:13:23.550 --> 02:13:25.550]  Right on the agenda as soon as Donald Trump
[02:13:25.550 --> 02:13:27.550]  Gets back home
[02:13:27.550 --> 02:13:29.550]  Just briefly expanding on that
[02:13:29.550 --> 02:13:31.550]  Saudi Arabia
[02:13:31.550 --> 02:13:33.550]  Has been kind of on both sides of the fence
[02:13:33.550 --> 02:13:35.550]  With terror funding it
[02:13:35.550 --> 02:13:37.550]  Exporting it but also at the same time fighting it because
[02:13:37.550 --> 02:13:39.550]  They don't want you to get too strong at home
[02:13:39.550 --> 02:13:41.550]  Israel's obviously been very strong overall fighting it
[02:13:41.550 --> 02:13:43.550]  The Vatican was normally anti radical Islam
[02:13:43.550 --> 02:13:45.550]  This current Pope
[02:13:45.550 --> 02:13:47.550]  Has made a lot of comments about
[02:13:47.550 --> 02:13:49.550]  They're not terrorists they're not bad
[02:13:49.550 --> 02:13:51.550]  I hate Europe's Christian roots
[02:13:51.550 --> 02:13:53.550]  I mean this current Pope
[02:13:53.550 --> 02:13:55.550]  What is going on with him from your intel
[02:13:55.550 --> 02:13:57.550]  Well the Pope is a socialist
[02:13:57.550 --> 02:13:59.550]  From Argentina
[02:13:59.550 --> 02:14:01.550]  He comes through the
[02:14:01.550 --> 02:14:03.550]  Entire Argentinian
[02:14:03.550 --> 02:14:05.550]  Catholic Church which was very
[02:14:05.550 --> 02:14:07.550]  Radically to the left
[02:14:07.550 --> 02:14:09.550]  And the Pope has
[02:14:09.550 --> 02:14:11.550]  Been more in line with Barack Obama
[02:14:11.550 --> 02:14:13.550]  Than he is with Donald Trump
[02:14:13.550 --> 02:14:15.550]  Now the challenge for the Pope
[02:14:15.550 --> 02:14:17.550]  Is going to be that
[02:14:17.550 --> 02:14:19.550]  Donald Trump has now made it clear that we
[02:14:19.550 --> 02:14:21.550]  Are not at war with Islam
[02:14:21.550 --> 02:14:23.550]  Islam is accepted
[02:14:23.550 --> 02:14:25.550]  That's something the Pope wants to have happen
[02:14:25.550 --> 02:14:27.550]  The Pope is going to have to
[02:14:27.550 --> 02:14:29.550]  Really I think come into a
[02:14:29.550 --> 02:14:31.550]  A bond
[02:14:31.550 --> 02:14:33.550]  With the rest of the
[02:14:33.550 --> 02:14:35.550]  Churches
[02:14:35.550 --> 02:14:37.550]  With the Jewish religion
[02:14:37.550 --> 02:14:39.550]  With Islamic religion
[02:14:39.550 --> 02:14:41.550]  And bring the Catholic religion
[02:14:41.550 --> 02:14:43.550]  Along I mean these are major
[02:14:43.550 --> 02:14:45.550]  Major changes
[02:14:45.550 --> 02:14:47.550]  I think the
[02:14:47.550 --> 02:14:49.550]  Anglican religion the whole idea now
[02:14:49.550 --> 02:14:51.550]  Of getting the UK
[02:14:51.550 --> 02:14:53.550]  Much more involved in
[02:14:53.550 --> 02:14:55.550]  Fighting terrorism
[02:14:55.550 --> 02:14:57.550]  And we've got to be clear
[02:14:57.550 --> 02:14:59.550]  That what we're fighting is
[02:14:59.550 --> 02:15:01.550]  This whole issue of radical
[02:15:01.550 --> 02:15:03.550]  Islamic terrorism
[02:15:03.550 --> 02:15:05.550]  And whether or not you're defining these
[02:15:05.550 --> 02:15:07.550]  As soon as they're terrorists they're not any longer part of Islam
[02:15:07.550 --> 02:15:09.550]  Well that's too convenient a
[02:15:09.550 --> 02:15:11.550]  Definition I mean
[02:15:11.550 --> 02:15:13.550]  That causes sectarian violence between Shiite
[02:15:13.550 --> 02:15:15.550]  Well let me ask you this and let you go
[02:15:15.550 --> 02:15:17.550]  We've got our next guest and we'll have a few calls
[02:15:17.550 --> 02:15:19.550]  But this is all riveting
[02:15:19.550 --> 02:15:21.550]  Okay Trump did do a real alliance
[02:15:21.550 --> 02:15:23.550]  The Saudis are suddenly even apologizing
[02:15:23.550 --> 02:15:25.550]  To US envoys
[02:15:25.550 --> 02:15:27.550]  Liberal envoys and are now admitting
[02:15:27.550 --> 02:15:29.550]  They were behind Al Qaeda and saying we made a mistake
[02:15:29.550 --> 02:15:31.550]  Is it because they failed?
[02:15:31.550 --> 02:15:33.550]  Is it because they got their butt kicked in Syria?
[02:15:33.550 --> 02:15:35.550]  What happened? Because suddenly the word is
[02:15:35.550 --> 02:15:37.550]  The Saudis are actually
[02:15:37.550 --> 02:15:39.550]  Saying okay we were behind it we apologize
[02:15:39.550 --> 02:15:41.550]  What got them to suddenly roll over to Trump?
[02:15:41.550 --> 02:15:43.550]  I think
[02:15:43.550 --> 02:15:45.550]  The Saudis realized that the
[02:15:45.550 --> 02:15:47.550]  Threat is about to
[02:15:47.550 --> 02:15:49.550]  To the same kind of an Arab spring
[02:15:49.550 --> 02:15:51.550]  That we saw with the Muslim Brotherhood
[02:15:51.550 --> 02:15:53.550]  That the Saudis
[02:15:53.550 --> 02:15:55.550]  Are fearful for retaining their
[02:15:55.550 --> 02:15:57.550]  Own kingdom and having
[02:15:57.550 --> 02:15:59.550]  The radicals which they've now nurtured
[02:15:59.550 --> 02:16:01.550]  And funded turn against
[02:16:01.550 --> 02:16:03.550]  The Saudi government
[02:16:03.550 --> 02:16:05.550]  That's the threat and if
[02:16:05.550 --> 02:16:07.550]  Wahhabism combines
[02:16:07.550 --> 02:16:09.550]  Effectively with Al Qaeda
[02:16:09.550 --> 02:16:11.550]  And ISIS within
[02:16:11.550 --> 02:16:13.550]  The Sunnis then
[02:16:13.550 --> 02:16:15.550]  The Saudi Arabian government is
[02:16:15.550 --> 02:16:17.550]  At threat of being overthrown
[02:16:17.550 --> 02:16:19.550]  And they've seen it happen
[02:16:19.550 --> 02:16:21.550]  They've seen it happen in Libya they've seen it happen
[02:16:21.550 --> 02:16:23.550]  In Egypt and now they want to
[02:16:23.550 --> 02:16:25.550]  Bond with Egypt and Jordan
[02:16:25.550 --> 02:16:27.550]  And the other responsible countries
[02:16:27.550 --> 02:16:29.550]  To say we are not going to
[02:16:29.550 --> 02:16:31.550]  Tolerate this terrorism
[02:16:31.550 --> 02:16:33.550]  Any longer and if it's part of Islam
[02:16:33.550 --> 02:16:35.550]  We're going to define it as outside Islam
[02:16:35.550 --> 02:16:37.550]  But let's be clear the West behind the scenes
[02:16:37.550 --> 02:16:39.550]  Wanted to work with radical Islam
[02:16:39.550 --> 02:16:41.550]  The real leverage the Saudis now know is
[02:16:41.550 --> 02:16:43.550]  We're not going to work with radical Islam behind the scenes
[02:16:43.550 --> 02:16:45.550]  This is a real war on it
[02:16:45.550 --> 02:16:47.550]  You better pick a side right now
[02:16:47.550 --> 02:16:49.550]  Or we're going to destabilize you and blow you off the map
[02:16:49.550 --> 02:16:51.550]  You can either be modern
[02:16:51.550 --> 02:16:53.550]  Have the weapons have the technology be respected
[02:16:53.550 --> 02:16:55.550]  You keep playing a double game
[02:16:55.550 --> 02:16:57.550]  It's over that's what I've been told by my army sources
[02:16:57.550 --> 02:16:59.550]  Yeah and it's also
[02:16:59.550 --> 02:17:01.550]  Aimed very strong at
[02:17:01.550 --> 02:17:03.550]  Iran because
[02:17:03.550 --> 02:17:05.550]  Iran is I think you know also
[02:17:05.550 --> 02:17:07.550]  One of the major major
[02:17:07.550 --> 02:17:09.550]  Factors here of
[02:17:09.550 --> 02:17:11.550]  Destabilizing the country
[02:17:11.550 --> 02:17:13.550]  Yeah and in fact
[02:17:13.550 --> 02:17:15.550]  Iran I think is going to have to
[02:17:15.550 --> 02:17:17.550]  Take the agreement that President Obama
[02:17:17.550 --> 02:17:19.550]  Signed and rip it up
[02:17:19.550 --> 02:17:21.550]  Because it's not going to be followed
[02:17:21.550 --> 02:17:23.550]  The President Trump understands
[02:17:23.550 --> 02:17:25.550]  That we can't give the Iranians
[02:17:25.550 --> 02:17:27.550]  Ten years to build nuclear weapons
[02:17:27.550 --> 02:17:29.550]  They've got to be stopped now
[02:17:29.550 --> 02:17:31.550]  The two countries that are going to go on the block
[02:17:31.550 --> 02:17:33.550]  As soon as it comes back
[02:17:33.550 --> 02:17:35.550]  I think are North Korea
[02:17:35.550 --> 02:17:37.550]  And Iran
[02:17:37.550 --> 02:17:39.550]  And neither one of them are going to be allowed
[02:17:39.550 --> 02:17:41.550]  To continue advancing as rapidly as they are
[02:17:41.550 --> 02:17:43.550]  To do nuclear weapons
[02:17:43.550 --> 02:17:45.550]  Great points
[02:17:45.550 --> 02:17:47.550]  Major geopolitical alignments happening
[02:17:47.550 --> 02:17:49.550]  Thank you Dr. Corsi
[02:17:49.550 --> 02:17:51.550]  Thank you
[02:17:51.550 --> 02:17:53.550]  Now I thought we had the guest for most of the hour
[02:17:53.550 --> 02:17:55.550]  But he's got to go soon so I'll get the call
[02:17:55.550 --> 02:17:57.550]  Or something like 40 after so
[02:17:57.550 --> 02:17:59.550]  It's really great to have him on
[02:17:59.550 --> 02:18:01.550]  I probably should have just moved to another day
[02:18:01.550 --> 02:18:03.550]  You know with the whole terror attack situation
[02:18:03.550 --> 02:18:05.550]  But this is so important that when I read the book
[02:18:05.550 --> 02:18:07.550]  A few weeks ago I said we've got to carry this
[02:18:07.550 --> 02:18:09.550]  Jeff Mercola, New York Times best selling author
[02:18:09.550 --> 02:18:11.550]  Of Effortless Healing
[02:18:11.550 --> 02:18:13.550]  A revolutionary diet to combat cancer
[02:18:13.550 --> 02:18:15.550]  Boost brain power, increase your energy
[02:18:15.550 --> 02:18:17.550]  Now as crazy as he pioneered a lot of this
[02:18:17.550 --> 02:18:19.550]  Suddenly big studies are out
[02:18:19.550 --> 02:18:21.550]  Silicon Valley was in the news a few months ago
[02:18:21.550 --> 02:18:23.550]  Saying they're obsessed
[02:18:23.550 --> 02:18:25.550]  With the pure fat, the uncooked fat
[02:18:25.550 --> 02:18:27.550]  The clean fats
[02:18:27.550 --> 02:18:29.550]  And other super foods
[02:18:29.550 --> 02:18:31.550]  To live longer and to boost your brain
[02:18:31.550 --> 02:18:33.550]  Jeff Mercola wrote about decades ago
[02:18:33.550 --> 02:18:35.550]  It's available on Kindle
[02:18:35.550 --> 02:18:37.550]  Also available at infowarsstore.com
[02:18:37.550 --> 02:18:39.550]  Fat for fuel
[02:18:39.550 --> 02:18:41.550]  You may already know all about this
[02:18:41.550 --> 02:18:43.550]  But it's great to give to friends and family
[02:18:43.550 --> 02:18:45.550]  We're going to break soon but wow
[02:18:45.550 --> 02:18:47.550]  It's got to feel good Dr. Mercola
[02:18:47.550 --> 02:18:49.550]  Because you are a medical doctor
[02:18:49.550 --> 02:18:51.550]  You've been verified yet again as a trailblazer
[02:18:51.550 --> 02:18:53.550]  Yes thank you
[02:18:53.550 --> 02:18:55.550]  It does feel tremendous to offer a resource
[02:18:55.550 --> 02:18:57.550]  That's so helpful to so many
[02:18:57.550 --> 02:18:59.550]  So it really addresses some major challenges
[02:18:59.550 --> 02:19:01.550]  We have in this country
[02:19:01.550 --> 02:19:03.550]  50% of the people watching this are going to come down with cancer
[02:19:03.550 --> 02:19:05.550]  40% of the men, 40% of the women
[02:19:05.550 --> 02:19:07.550]  And that's not skin cancer
[02:19:07.550 --> 02:19:09.550]  That's serious cancer
[02:19:09.550 --> 02:19:11.550]  It's going to be the leading cause of death
[02:19:11.550 --> 02:19:13.550]  We discussed the strategies on how to get your body to burn fat
[02:19:13.550 --> 02:19:15.550]  As a primary fuel
[02:19:15.550 --> 02:19:17.550]  Which is one of the most potent interventions
[02:19:17.550 --> 02:19:19.550]  You can have as a foundation
[02:19:19.550 --> 02:19:21.550]  To prevent not only cancer
[02:19:21.550 --> 02:19:23.550]  But heart disease, diabetes and obesity
[02:19:24.390 --> 02:19:30.510]  You know, I'm just sitting here reading the back of the book, I'm gonna go ahead and skip
[02:19:30.510 --> 02:19:36.789]  this break so we have more time, and going through what you break down in here, I remember
[02:19:36.789 --> 02:19:41.189]  my dad, who's a physician as well, when I was a little kid going, this is bull about
[02:19:41.189 --> 02:19:45.349]  low fat diets, it's the kind of fat, if you want, you know, clean fat, fat that
[02:19:45.349 --> 02:19:52.349]  hadn't been burned, that hadn't made the fats, you know, basically become toxic molecules,
[02:19:52.349 --> 02:19:54.189]  that was the words he was using when I was a little kid.
[02:19:54.189 --> 02:19:59.830]  Now we have all these technical terms and so this has been known for a while, it just hasn't
[02:19:59.830 --> 02:20:00.830]  been popularized.
[02:20:00.830 --> 02:20:04.789]  I know you were talking about it 30 years ago, so how did my dad, 30 something years
[02:20:04.789 --> 02:20:06.590]  ago, 40 years ago, know about this?
[02:20:06.590 --> 02:20:07.810]  How did you know about it?
[02:20:07.810 --> 02:20:12.269]  You've now collated into a book, but again, why are they now suddenly admitting you're
[02:20:12.269 --> 02:20:13.269]  right?
[02:20:13.269 --> 02:20:18.869]  Well, your dad has that rare commodity called common sense and I apparently didn't have
[02:20:18.869 --> 02:20:22.310]  it because at the same time your dad understood and I was clueless and had bought into the
[02:20:22.310 --> 02:20:24.510]  low fat myth because it was supported by all these people.
[02:20:24.510 --> 02:20:28.109]  Okay, so maybe you just were doing the low fat thing a long time ago, but I remember
[02:20:28.109 --> 02:20:29.109]  you for a while saying-
[02:20:29.109 --> 02:20:33.949]  No, no, I mean, we're talking in the 70s and 80s, you know, I definitely woke up in
[02:20:33.949 --> 02:20:38.630]  the 90s, but your dad, I think, understood it long before then and even though the
[02:20:38.630 --> 02:20:43.349]  title of the book is Fat for Fuel, your dad also recognized it's the low quality
[02:20:43.349 --> 02:20:48.230]  fat that is probably even a more pernicious toxin, so the industrialized processed vegetable
[02:20:48.230 --> 02:20:51.390]  oils, you know, those will get you sicker than sugar.
[02:20:51.390 --> 02:20:53.430]  So it's, we're talking about high quality-
[02:20:53.430 --> 02:20:54.789]  Well, that's because he's also a chemist.
[02:20:54.789 --> 02:20:58.550]  He was explaining that when you burn this stuff, heat it up, change it, that it's-
[02:20:58.550 --> 02:21:04.849]  Yes, it's not only trans fats, it's the cyclic aldehydes, which are now even potentially
[02:21:04.849 --> 02:21:08.349]  more toxic than trans fats, that they're, now that trans fats are banned, these
[02:21:08.349 --> 02:21:09.349]  are the-
[02:21:09.349 --> 02:21:13.750]  So when I read the headline even of CNN that McDonald's uses plasticizers using breast
[02:21:13.750 --> 02:21:16.590]  implants in nuggets, how are they able to get away with that?
[02:21:16.590 --> 02:21:22.310]  I know there's now lawsuits about food additives having a grandfather clause.
[02:21:22.310 --> 02:21:29.070]  Yeah, there's a categorization called GRAS, generally recognized as safe, and if substances
[02:21:29.070 --> 02:21:35.830]  have been around before a specific date, they're grandfathered in, unless there's very compelling
[02:21:35.830 --> 02:21:39.830]  scientific evidence to counter that, and in some cases, that's been the case.
[02:21:39.830 --> 02:21:44.590]  Certainly was with trans fat, which is just, I think, banned or is in the process
[02:21:44.590 --> 02:21:45.830]  of being eliminated from the food-
[02:21:46.070 --> 02:21:47.550]  And you agree it should be, right?
[02:21:47.550 --> 02:21:48.550]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:21:48.550 --> 02:21:49.550]  There's no question.
[02:21:49.550 --> 02:21:50.550]  Yeah.
[02:21:50.550 --> 02:21:52.349]  We've known that for probably close to 80 years.
[02:21:52.349 --> 02:21:56.189]  Dr. Fred Kumerow, who's still alive at the University of Illinois, is 102 years
[02:21:56.189 --> 02:21:59.310]  old, is one of the original scientists that figured that out in the 30s.
[02:21:59.310 --> 02:22:00.869]  Well, I've been interrupting here.
[02:22:00.869 --> 02:22:03.230]  Let's talk about, because I'm so excited, fat for fuel.
[02:22:03.230 --> 02:22:07.390]  I'm no beach boy, but I got really unhealthy over 15 years, have kind of lost 60, 70
[02:22:07.390 --> 02:22:12.630]  pounds, got a lot healthier since then, but by eating more uncooked fish, very
[02:22:12.710 --> 02:22:16.590]  low-cooked beef, things like that, having more micronutrients.
[02:22:16.590 --> 02:22:19.750]  So everything you've been writing about for decades, I now go into California
[02:22:19.750 --> 02:22:25.269]  Pizza Kitchen with my children saying, we have the micronutrients, the superfoods.
[02:22:25.269 --> 02:22:29.070]  Whether that's true or not, you know that when even the fast food places or
[02:22:29.070 --> 02:22:34.150]  quasi-fast food are trying to sound like Dr. Mercola, we're turning some corner.
[02:22:34.150 --> 02:22:36.029]  Yes, we are making progress, there's no question.
[02:22:36.029 --> 02:22:41.430]  And it was, I realized a long time ago, like you, that the solution
[02:22:41.430 --> 02:22:44.349]  is really to go directly to the people that if you're trying to do it through
[02:22:44.349 --> 02:22:47.029]  the scientific journals and the professional community, you're going to
[02:22:47.029 --> 02:22:50.390]  be sabotaged because there's too many entrenched interests.
[02:22:50.390 --> 02:22:52.230]  So that's the, we have a similar strategy.
[02:22:52.230 --> 02:22:57.310]  I reach millions like you do, and eventually the people get it.
[02:22:57.310 --> 02:22:59.990]  They start to become un-brainwashed and
[02:22:59.990 --> 02:23:02.830]  manipulated as they are from the traditional media.
[02:23:04.830 --> 02:23:09.750]  Well, let's walk through fat for fuel, available at infowarsstore.com.
[02:23:09.750 --> 02:23:14.230]  Again, this is such a beautiful book, so well written, goes over it all.
[02:23:14.230 --> 02:23:17.070]  If you've got family, especially that seem like they're having neurological
[02:23:17.070 --> 02:23:19.230]  disorders, I don't want to act like I'm a doctor here.
[02:23:19.230 --> 02:23:22.670]  I just know that my uncle has epilepsy from a motorcycle accident.
[02:23:22.670 --> 02:23:27.590]  And he was told 20 years ago by his doctor, you need to have healthy,
[02:23:27.590 --> 02:23:31.990]  high quality fish oils and other fats that are not toxic.
[02:23:31.990 --> 02:23:36.470]  And you know what, it made him cut his seizures even more than drugs.
[02:23:36.510 --> 02:23:38.150]  It has been the standard of care for
[02:23:38.150 --> 02:23:41.990]  the treatment of drug resistant seizure disorders for the last 80 years.
[02:23:41.990 --> 02:23:43.710]  So this is nothing new.
[02:23:43.710 --> 02:23:45.230]  It's been around for a long time.
[02:23:45.230 --> 02:23:48.630]  We just started to recently appreciate its value in the treatment of all other
[02:23:48.630 --> 02:23:54.750]  diseases, because it really addresses the foundational issue of most diseases,
[02:23:54.750 --> 02:23:57.550]  which is dysfunction of the mitochondria,
[02:23:57.550 --> 02:24:03.189]  which are these cellular structures that generate energy to your body and-
[02:24:03.269 --> 02:24:07.630]  So why is fat so important and what types of fats are good?
[02:24:07.630 --> 02:24:10.310]  Simply because your fat burns more efficiently.
[02:24:10.310 --> 02:24:14.109]  It's less polluted fuel so that when you burn it as a primary fuel,
[02:24:14.109 --> 02:24:16.710]  you generate something less reactive oxygen species,
[02:24:16.710 --> 02:24:19.150]  which generates secondary less free radicals,
[02:24:19.150 --> 02:24:22.109]  which is what causes most of the generation.
[02:24:22.109 --> 02:24:25.670]  So on one end, sugar is really toxic and really bad.
[02:24:25.670 --> 02:24:28.150]  On the other end, clean uncooked fat is the best.
[02:24:29.150 --> 02:24:33.550]  Well, it's not that quite simple.
[02:24:33.550 --> 02:24:38.230]  It's actually having them in the right ratios until your body is able to have
[02:24:38.230 --> 02:24:40.430]  the metabolic flexibility to burn either.
[02:24:40.430 --> 02:24:43.949]  And then one of the things we introduced is to make sure that you have adequate,
[02:24:43.949 --> 02:24:47.470]  not excessive protein, because not only do you have to pay attention to the quality of the fat,
[02:24:47.470 --> 02:24:52.990]  but you have to limit the carbs and the protein until your body is burning fat.
[02:24:52.990 --> 02:24:55.070]  And then you can go on- So the way I should explain it, obviously,
[02:24:56.070 --> 02:25:02.150]  is there's got to be a balance between what they call a classic Adkins diet or paleo or whatever.
[02:25:02.150 --> 02:25:06.029]  You've gone to the science to find the best type of real diet.
[02:25:06.029 --> 02:25:10.150]  Yes, because if you don't cycle this, if you just go on straight nutritional ketosis,
[02:25:10.150 --> 02:25:11.510]  that could be even more damaging.
[02:25:11.510 --> 02:25:14.830]  You'll basically starve to death almost and your body will start to deteriorate.
[02:25:14.830 --> 02:25:19.269]  So once you've transitioned, and we discuss how to do that in the book by measuring
[02:25:19.269 --> 02:25:23.910]  the ketones, which are these water soluble fats that penetrate really easily to the brain
[02:25:23.949 --> 02:25:28.349]  and nourish your cells really efficiently with less reactive oxygen species.
[02:25:28.349 --> 02:25:32.590]  Once you're doing that, then you can have feast days where you have a lot of healthy carbs,
[02:25:32.590 --> 02:25:33.390]  like sweet potatoes.
[02:25:33.390 --> 02:25:34.910]  Today, I did some heavy lifting.
[02:25:34.910 --> 02:25:37.349]  So I do that two or three times a week, and on those days,
[02:25:37.349 --> 02:25:41.510]  I have a fairly significant amount of healthy carbs and extra protein to build muscle mass.
[02:25:41.510 --> 02:25:46.949]  So it's a really easy food choice to integrate into your program,
[02:25:46.949 --> 02:25:50.349]  and it really addresses almost every single chronic degenerative disease we know.
[02:25:50.349 --> 02:25:51.710]  It's a foundational strategy.
[02:25:51.710 --> 02:25:55.269]  Well, that makes sense because I myself, and I got really big,
[02:25:55.269 --> 02:25:58.910]  it's like over 280 pounds now, down to like 230 something, but I'm still a big guy.
[02:25:58.910 --> 02:26:03.990]  But a diet works for a while, and then it stops working, and that's what your book gets
[02:26:03.990 --> 02:26:07.630]  into. You've got to take a spectrum of natural diets and then cycle through them,
[02:26:07.630 --> 02:26:10.349]  because that's the only thing that's constant is change.
[02:26:10.349 --> 02:26:16.470]  Yeah, this is not a standard set of rules that we recommend for everyone.
[02:26:16.470 --> 02:26:18.670]  It's just really guidelines, and within those guidelines,
[02:26:18.670 --> 02:26:21.070]  you customize it according to your strategy.
[02:26:21.269 --> 02:26:24.470]  So for the 70% of the people in the country are overweight,
[02:26:24.470 --> 02:26:27.390]  they may want to integrate other metabolic strategies,
[02:26:27.390 --> 02:26:32.109]  such as fasting and intermittent fasting, and even going on to fast for three, five,
[02:26:32.109 --> 02:26:36.710]  seven days, maybe even longer, can jumpstart the process at which your body starts to burn
[02:26:36.710 --> 02:26:41.269]  fat as its primary fuel and can be a very powerful and really inexpensive intervention.
[02:26:41.269 --> 02:26:42.590]  It doesn't cost anything to not eat food.
[02:26:42.590 --> 02:26:43.789]  Well, here's my problem with fasting.
[02:26:43.789 --> 02:26:45.109]  I've done it three, four days at a time.
[02:26:45.109 --> 02:26:48.029]  I've never been into drugs or anything.
[02:26:48.070 --> 02:26:52.230]  I get hired in a kite and start bouncing off the walls about day three or four.
[02:26:52.230 --> 02:26:55.550]  Yeah, well, usually most people have trouble about day two or three,
[02:26:55.550 --> 02:26:59.470]  but it gets easier after that, but then you can go back on having food.
[02:26:59.470 --> 02:27:04.109]  So fasting is voluntary, starvation is not.
[02:27:04.109 --> 02:27:04.789]  No, it's not.
[02:27:04.789 --> 02:27:08.390]  You have the total flexibility to eat food whenever you need it.
[02:27:08.390 --> 02:27:11.550]  As you said, studying history, I know you've written about this,
[02:27:11.550 --> 02:27:14.949]  for humans, humans are normally feast or famine, right?
[02:27:14.949 --> 02:27:17.789]  We're not supposed to just always have a ton of food or always have none.
[02:27:18.590 --> 02:27:21.949]  We only recently have had access to food 24-7.
[02:27:21.949 --> 02:27:26.510]  For the vast majority of human existence,
[02:27:26.510 --> 02:27:31.430]  we've had really significant amounts of times where we didn't have access to food.
[02:27:31.430 --> 02:27:36.430]  So our genetics, our biochemistry, our metabolism is designed for that,
[02:27:36.430 --> 02:27:43.830]  to really have that intermittent types of approaches with calories and eating.
[02:27:43.830 --> 02:27:46.349]  So if you eat continuously, as most people do,
[02:27:46.349 --> 02:27:49.150]  that shifts your metabolism to really burning carbohydrates
[02:27:49.150 --> 02:27:51.189]  or glycogen as your primary fuel source,
[02:27:51.189 --> 02:27:55.230]  which has enormous metabolic adverse consequences.
[02:27:56.750 --> 02:27:59.630]  Well, Doc, the book is fat for fuel.
[02:27:59.630 --> 02:28:03.390]  And I've read, I don't know, hundreds of news articles
[02:28:03.390 --> 02:28:07.310]  about the best type of diets and seven or eight books about it.
[02:28:07.310 --> 02:28:10.189]  And I got to tell you, the reason I love the book is it isn't one diet,
[02:28:10.189 --> 02:28:11.310]  it isn't one formula.
[02:28:11.310 --> 02:28:14.830]  It's a spectrum of the science and what works for people
[02:28:14.830 --> 02:28:17.550]  to decide with their own metabolic system, their own family history,
[02:28:18.109 --> 02:28:18.990]  what works best for them.
[02:28:18.990 --> 02:28:20.670]  And that's why I think it's the book.
[02:28:20.670 --> 02:28:23.869]  I think you've written out of thousands of books, the book out there.
[02:28:24.670 --> 02:28:26.670]  Well, it's not just that I wrote it.
[02:28:27.470 --> 02:28:30.910]  Most books are written by one author and it's their impressions and ideas.
[02:28:30.910 --> 02:28:32.349]  That's right. It's a big research document.
[02:28:32.990 --> 02:28:36.990]  But what I did was I sent it out to two dozen of the top experts
[02:28:36.990 --> 02:28:38.189]  in the world in this area.
[02:28:38.189 --> 02:28:39.470]  So it's really peer reviewed.
[02:28:39.470 --> 02:28:40.830]  It's this consensus.
[02:28:40.830 --> 02:28:42.269]  It's not just my ideas.
[02:28:42.750 --> 02:28:46.910]  The science is really valid and accurate and it's rock solid.
[02:28:46.910 --> 02:28:50.990]  So they're going to get major benefits by doing this.
[02:28:50.990 --> 02:28:54.109]  And there's a consensus among the scientific researchers
[02:28:54.109 --> 02:28:56.109]  in recommending this type of approach.
[02:28:57.150 --> 02:28:57.550]  All right.
[02:28:57.550 --> 02:28:59.789]  We're going to go to break when we got like 10 more minutes left with you.
[02:28:59.789 --> 02:29:01.390]  When we come back, I'm going to go to phone calls.
[02:29:01.390 --> 02:29:04.830]  But again, Dr. Mercola, I don't need to introduce you to folks.
[02:29:04.830 --> 02:29:06.029]  Most people know who you are.
[02:29:06.750 --> 02:29:08.349]  When we come back, I want to talk more about the book,
[02:29:08.349 --> 02:29:13.390]  but also briefly the state of the fight to have supplements,
[02:29:13.390 --> 02:29:17.869]  vitamins, minerals, nutrients, because I see so much demonization more than ever
[02:29:18.430 --> 02:29:20.910]  against even mainline supplements.
[02:29:20.910 --> 02:29:24.590]  I've even had news articles demonizing us now for selling organic shampoo.
[02:29:24.590 --> 02:29:26.830]  They're even demonizing selling shampoo now.
[02:29:26.830 --> 02:29:30.109]  So this seems to be like a new level of kind of the empire strikes back.
[02:29:30.670 --> 02:29:33.470]  Seemed like for a while, people like you were leading the fight to win,
[02:29:34.430 --> 02:29:37.550]  you know, to get GMO labeling and to wake up.
[02:29:37.550 --> 02:29:41.230]  And I think because you're winning so big, they're now counter striking.
[02:29:41.230 --> 02:29:43.869]  I want to see if you think I'm right straight ahead.
[02:29:43.869 --> 02:29:45.550]  I'm Alex Jones with Dr. Mercola.
[02:29:45.550 --> 02:29:46.029]  Stay with us.
[02:29:50.349 --> 02:29:51.710]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.710 --> 02:29:53.310]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.189 --> 02:29:56.990]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.230 --> 02:30:03.310]  James Madison, the father of the Bill of Rights,
[02:30:03.310 --> 02:30:08.189]  wrote where an excess of power prevails, property of no sort is duly respected.
[02:30:08.189 --> 02:30:13.630]  No man is safe in his opinions, in his person, in his faculties or in his possessions.
[02:30:13.630 --> 02:30:17.070]  Is there any question that we have an excess of power in Washington?
[02:30:17.070 --> 02:30:19.310]  The only question is, how do we contain it?
[02:30:19.310 --> 02:30:24.750]  And how do we remove that power from Washington to our local communities to the individual?
[02:30:24.750 --> 02:30:26.510]  That is the ultimate concern.
[02:30:26.510 --> 02:30:28.990]  The concentration of power, the excess of power,
[02:30:28.990 --> 02:30:32.750]  was always the chief concern of the founders of this country.
[02:30:32.750 --> 02:30:35.230]  It was why the anti-federalists opposed the Constitution.
[02:30:35.230 --> 02:30:39.470]  They believed they put safeguards in the Constitution to abuse that concentration of power.
[02:30:39.470 --> 02:30:44.109]  But as James Madison also pointed out, knowledge will forever govern ignorance.
[02:30:44.109 --> 02:30:46.189]  A people who mean to be their own governors
[02:30:46.189 --> 02:30:49.550]  must arm themselves with the power that knowledge gives.
[02:30:49.550 --> 02:30:52.349]  Arm yourself with the information of what your rulers are doing,
[02:30:52.349 --> 02:30:54.990]  of what the real constraints upon them are.
[02:30:54.990 --> 02:30:58.670]  Only then will you have the courage to nullify their actions.
[02:30:58.670 --> 02:31:00.910]  From ProWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[02:31:00.910 --> 02:31:02.830]  Imbrix Essentials, that's my middle name.
[02:31:02.830 --> 02:31:09.869]  I've spent seven years off and on trying to get a big national brand that's already trusted
[02:31:09.869 --> 02:31:15.310]  to let us private label an entire line of personal care products that's organic and high-quality.
[02:31:15.310 --> 02:31:20.510]  This is one of the top three selling organic brands in the country
[02:31:20.510 --> 02:31:24.349]  that puts out high-quality organic shampoo, mouthwash, you name it.
[02:31:24.349 --> 02:31:29.070]  And they're such patriots, they have let us basically keep their well-known packaging.
[02:31:29.070 --> 02:31:31.710]  It is an answer to prayer, and because we're cutting out the middleman,
[02:31:31.710 --> 02:31:36.189]  20% off retail, sign up for auto ship, an additional 25% off.
[02:31:36.189 --> 02:31:37.390]  It's all there.
[02:31:37.390 --> 02:31:42.750]  The body wash, the shampoo, the deodorant, the mouthwash, all of it is truly game-changing.
[02:31:42.750 --> 02:31:46.910]  It is the exact same product, just the name is different, Imbrix Essentials,
[02:31:46.910 --> 02:31:50.750]  and it's on average 20% off what it would be in stores,
[02:31:50.750 --> 02:31:53.550]  buying it directly from Infowarsstore.com.
[02:31:53.550 --> 02:31:56.109]  Help us win the Infowar while getting products everybody needs.
[02:31:56.189 --> 02:32:00.750]  Infowarslive.com, where you'll find the entire line of Imbrix Essentials.
[02:32:00.750 --> 02:32:03.550]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue Fluoride
[02:32:03.550 --> 02:32:06.269]  toothpaste is now back in stock at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:32:06.269 --> 02:32:08.269]  Research across the board is clear.
[02:32:08.269 --> 02:32:11.390]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream
[02:32:11.390 --> 02:32:13.630]  and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[02:32:13.630 --> 02:32:16.830]  That's why the last surgeon general's report on oral health
[02:32:16.830 --> 02:32:20.910]  warns that your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[02:32:20.910 --> 02:32:24.109]  Super Blue Fluoride free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[02:32:24.109 --> 02:32:27.949]  It's loaded with good halogen iodine, instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[02:32:27.949 --> 02:32:31.949]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times
[02:32:31.949 --> 02:32:35.150]  to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[02:32:35.150 --> 02:32:39.949]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol,
[02:32:39.949 --> 02:32:44.349]  peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver, and more, due to requests from listeners
[02:32:44.349 --> 02:32:47.550]  who found that spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their children.
[02:32:47.550 --> 02:32:51.150]  We have created the new bubble gum flavored Super Blue that is spearmint free.
[02:32:51.150 --> 02:32:54.750]  Learn more about the new bubble gum flavored Super Blue toothpaste and more
[02:32:54.750 --> 02:33:00.189]  at Infowarslife.com and support the Infowar while you support healthy gums and teeth.
[02:33:13.949 --> 02:33:17.230]  All right, I gave the number out earlier and then Tom got away from us
[02:33:18.349 --> 02:33:19.550]  and I didn't get your calls.
[02:33:20.510 --> 02:33:26.750]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance. It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:26.750 --> 02:33:29.550]  So as soon as Dr. Mercola, who's got riveting information,
[02:33:29.550 --> 02:33:32.029]  leaves us here in about 10 minutes, I'm gonna go write your calls
[02:33:32.029 --> 02:33:35.230]  and I've got some other breaking news that's exclusive to Infowars.com.
[02:33:36.670 --> 02:33:41.869]  Kim.com was able to predict what WikiLeaks was gonna put out.
[02:33:41.869 --> 02:33:45.869]  Roger Stone was not. I'm not putting Roger Stone down. I know what Roger Stone said.
[02:33:45.869 --> 02:33:47.869]  I know what Roger Stone was saying behind the scenes.
[02:33:48.510 --> 02:33:52.269]  Roger Stone was not involved with WikiLeaks because I was having the private discussions.
[02:33:52.269 --> 02:33:56.269]  He's like, yeah, I know a couple of reporters that are going to interview him that I've talked
[02:33:56.269 --> 02:34:00.349]  to. Roger talks to more reporters than anybody I know. And he said, I'm gonna try to find out
[02:34:00.349 --> 02:34:04.349]  what it is they claim they've got. Assange kept saying, I've got the big bombshell.
[02:34:04.349 --> 02:34:10.109]  I've got the big bombshell for six months before it came out, right before the RNC.
[02:34:10.510 --> 02:34:18.590]  And so Roger had the reporters go there and they called him back and said, yeah,
[02:34:18.590 --> 02:34:22.109]  you know, it's about this and that. But that's the connection. It's not Russians.
[02:34:23.310 --> 02:34:27.789]  Everybody's trying to talk to Assange. I mean, he goes on Fox News. He goes on CNN. It's just
[02:34:27.789 --> 02:34:32.269]  like, oh, but Roger talked to some reporters that talked to him and sent a message in.
[02:34:32.269 --> 02:34:37.789]  So he's a Russian agent. But Kim.com, who I'm a big fan of and who was gonna come on the
[02:34:37.789 --> 02:34:40.990]  show that had some family emergency once and he thought I was dissing him
[02:34:40.990 --> 02:34:45.869]  not being nervous. We canceled. I want to get Kim.com on because I followed Kim's tweets
[02:34:45.869 --> 02:34:51.150]  and Kim did predict everything that happened. And he does have the connections.
[02:34:51.150 --> 02:34:55.789]  I know folks high up and say, oh, that's the guy to talk to, quote, I know Seth Rich
[02:34:55.789 --> 02:35:01.310]  was involved in DNC leaks. Internet Guru says Rich wanted to drain the swamp from the inside,
[02:35:02.109 --> 02:35:04.349]  both parties, and they killed him.
[02:35:06.189 --> 02:35:10.990]  So this is crazy going back to Dr. Mercola. He's got the new book Fat for Fuel
[02:35:10.990 --> 02:35:14.269]  available at Infowarsstore.com. That way you support him, you support us,
[02:35:14.269 --> 02:35:16.990]  you support yourself. Now I want to warn you, it's easy to read.
[02:35:18.189 --> 02:35:22.269]  But it is like a textbook. I mean, it's I don't say textbook for dummies,
[02:35:22.269 --> 02:35:26.990]  but it covers every subject, every angle. This is something doctors should read because
[02:35:27.550 --> 02:35:32.750]  this really, I think, is the key of Solomon when it comes to decoding the different paradoxes
[02:35:32.750 --> 02:35:39.630]  that are out there of protein, fat, different imbalances, the ramp up, the way to ease in,
[02:35:39.630 --> 02:35:45.949]  managing your emotions during transition. Because here's the deal, I can quit eating
[02:35:45.949 --> 02:35:51.070]  carbohydrates and stuff, and then I turn into a not even a mean maniac. I'm like
[02:35:51.070 --> 02:35:55.949]  worse than I am now bouncing off the walls. So no wonder they want us all to eat a bunch
[02:35:55.949 --> 02:36:00.910]  of crap because we're more manageable that way. The power of being a real human is pretty amazing.
[02:36:00.910 --> 02:36:04.430]  So it's all there, the power of fasting. Dr. Mercola, I want to talk about your
[02:36:04.430 --> 02:36:08.109]  book in closing, but first, again, thank you for coming on the broadcast today and
[02:36:08.109 --> 02:36:11.869]  for your great work. What about the big picture I was mentioning before the break?
[02:36:13.550 --> 02:36:18.590]  Well, we are making progress, so we need to recognize that. I think the most recent
[02:36:18.590 --> 02:36:25.310]  observation is that California, as you probably covered in your broadcast earlier, has
[02:36:25.310 --> 02:36:32.109]  actually put the poison label on Roundup, and it's required that in the state of California.
[02:36:32.109 --> 02:36:34.430]  Not to give credit, but you've been pushing them for that for 20 years.
[02:36:35.150 --> 02:36:39.310]  Well, I don't know about 20 years, but certainly for a long time, most of this century, for sure.
[02:36:39.310 --> 02:36:42.910]  But I mean, you were like the first online with this stuff in like,
[02:36:43.550 --> 02:36:46.029]  I remember you're still 94, 95, right?
[02:36:46.029 --> 02:36:50.109]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. So we've been at it for a while. Actually,
[02:36:51.070 --> 02:36:55.150]  you know, my epiphany with the pernicious nature of
[02:36:55.789 --> 02:37:01.390]  glyphosate and Roundup really didn't occur until the early 2000s. But there are other
[02:37:01.390 --> 02:37:06.109]  major advocates like Steven Druker, who is an attorney who filed a lawsuit against the FDA.
[02:37:07.230 --> 02:37:10.430]  Sure, it's not about credit. The point is, we've all been at the tip of the spear,
[02:37:10.430 --> 02:37:12.270]  we're being vindicated, we're being proven right.
[02:37:12.910 --> 02:37:18.430]  Right. It's good to know that as long as people have the knowledge and information,
[02:37:18.910 --> 02:37:22.509]  this is a free country, we have freedom of choice, we vote with our pocketbooks,
[02:37:22.509 --> 02:37:23.949]  and that has enormous potential.
[02:37:23.949 --> 02:37:26.750]  For sure. And when I'm giving you credit, I know you're not a big ego guy. It's not about,
[02:37:26.750 --> 02:37:31.150]  oh, you're this wonder man. You help with your organization and your listeners,
[02:37:31.150 --> 02:37:34.109]  your supporters, spearhead labeling all over the country. I mean,
[02:37:34.109 --> 02:37:36.349]  let's give you and your listeners and everybody the credit.
[02:37:37.789 --> 02:37:39.230]  The point is, we're getting things done.
[02:37:39.789 --> 02:37:45.310]  Yes, we are. Yeah. And there's a reason for it. I recognized I could preach to the world
[02:37:45.310 --> 02:37:50.349]  all I want just like you're doing, but unless we organize and coalesce into some type of effective
[02:37:51.470 --> 02:37:55.949]  political health activism that we couldn't, these barriers that were in place by
[02:37:55.949 --> 02:38:01.949]  most of these corrupted federal regulatory agencies would impair the average person from
[02:38:01.949 --> 02:38:05.630]  being able to implement what we're seeking to teach them. So we're trying to break down
[02:38:05.630 --> 02:38:11.470]  those barriers and make it easy for everyone. Wow. So do you think overall we're starting
[02:38:11.470 --> 02:38:14.349]  to win or I mean, how is the empire striking back? Because it seems to be-
[02:38:14.830 --> 02:38:18.910]  There's a lot of fronts out there and I think we're making major progress on many of them.
[02:38:18.910 --> 02:38:21.630]  There's no doubt in my mind. And some of them were losing ground,
[02:38:21.630 --> 02:38:24.509]  but at least we're not losing it as fast as we would if we weren't in the battle.
[02:38:25.150 --> 02:38:31.949]  So there's a lot of work to do out there. We're just happy to give people the tools like
[02:38:31.949 --> 02:38:37.550]  fat for fuel that can essentially give them the freedom and insulate them from all this
[02:38:37.550 --> 02:38:42.750]  pernicious information they're getting so they don't have to suffer needlessly and die prematurely
[02:38:42.750 --> 02:38:49.630]  unnecessarily. I mean, it just breaks my heart to see kids dying from cancer and there's just
[02:38:49.630 --> 02:38:54.430]  no damn need for it. We have 1,600 people die every day in the United States.
[02:38:54.430 --> 02:38:59.310]  Let me ask a few quick questions here. You are a medical doctor and a pioneer exposing this.
[02:38:59.310 --> 02:39:03.470]  I mean, depending on the cancer, pediatric cancer is up like 10,000% from the 1940s.
[02:39:04.029 --> 02:39:10.109]  All these other cancers are exploding. And they never talk about why are they increasing,
[02:39:10.109 --> 02:39:11.630]  but you know a lot of those answers.
[02:39:12.830 --> 02:39:18.509]  Well, there's no one simple answer to that one. There's many variables that contribute to it.
[02:39:18.509 --> 02:39:21.949]  What is not burning fat for fuel? There's no question, but it's also
[02:39:21.949 --> 02:39:27.230]  the exposure of these many pernicious toxins. And one of the most widely and pervasive one is
[02:39:28.189 --> 02:39:32.590]  microwave radiation from your cell phone towers, your cell phones and your Wi-Fi routers.
[02:39:32.590 --> 02:39:38.349]  So that's a big one. And in conjunction with toxic food and other toxins they're exposed to
[02:39:38.670 --> 02:39:45.390]  in our environment, it can really, and infections, it can really play wreck
[02:39:45.390 --> 02:39:52.670]  havoc on your metabolism and your health. Now, a few other final questions.
[02:39:52.670 --> 02:39:59.390]  I remember the headline on Mercola.com. It's got to be 15 years ago or something.
[02:40:01.869 --> 02:40:02.990]  And the headline was
[02:40:03.400 --> 02:40:29.199]  Let me just point something out Alex, the challenge you just had there for a moment in your memory
[02:40:29.199 --> 02:40:33.240]  and also the cravings that you have when you go off of carbohydrates are a reflection that
[02:40:33.240 --> 02:40:37.600]  you're not burning fat as your primary fuel because you only have a limited amount of
[02:40:37.600 --> 02:40:42.080]  sugar in your body. Literally about 5% of your fuel in your body is stored as glycogen
[02:40:42.080 --> 02:40:47.760]  in your muscles and your liver. When you exhaust it in about 12 hours and you can't
[02:40:47.760 --> 02:40:52.840]  burn fat you're going to be below on fuel so you'll have all these symptoms with these
[02:40:52.840 --> 02:40:56.080]  cravings because your body needs fuel and it can't access the fat because you haven't
[02:40:56.080 --> 02:41:00.180]  taught it how to do it yet. That's what this whole book is designed to have you
[02:41:00.180 --> 02:41:03.660]  access it and the beautiful thing is once you are burning fat as your primary fuel you
[02:41:03.660 --> 02:41:08.140]  have this incredible mental clarity that just isn't unbelievable. Your memory, you just
[02:41:08.140 --> 02:41:15.619]  don't forget things anymore. The cravings disappear, these cravings for junk food
[02:41:15.619 --> 02:41:19.300]  they're just gone. They are just non-existent. You don't have to have higher willpower
[02:41:19.300 --> 02:41:23.779]  or discipline to implement the program. Once you burn fat as your primary fuel.
[02:41:23.779 --> 02:41:28.500]  Well I was interrupting there and to be specific I do get absent-minded or I do
[02:41:28.619 --> 02:41:32.740]  forget things. They had a feed in there running audio into my head that's why I was unable to
[02:41:32.740 --> 02:41:35.660]  think of it because I was hearing somebody else talk and it was driving me crazy. But
[02:41:35.660 --> 02:41:38.900]  sometimes I do forget things and have brain farts. But I mean get back to this
[02:41:38.900 --> 02:41:44.020]  repeat what you were saying because I interrupted about once you learn how to access fat by
[02:41:44.020 --> 02:41:48.779]  fasting or these certain diets you have in the book, fat for fuel, why all the studies,
[02:41:48.779 --> 02:41:53.020]  the research show it creates this incredible clarity. Why does it do that? Please repeat that.
[02:41:53.220 --> 02:41:59.900]  Well it does it because you teach your body, you encourage it so that it really adapts to
[02:41:59.900 --> 02:42:04.859]  have this metabolic flexibility to burn either fat or carbohydrates. 95% of the people in the
[02:42:04.859 --> 02:42:08.940]  country can only burn carbohydrates as a fuel and they can't access that. But when you do,
[02:42:08.940 --> 02:42:14.100]  these ketones burn very efficiently, they create less free radicals and they are water
[02:42:14.100 --> 02:42:18.539]  soluble fats that easily penetrate into the brain and provide them the fuel that works.
[02:42:18.660 --> 02:42:23.380]  It's just why this type of approach is used for drug-resistant seizure disorders and it saved
[02:42:23.380 --> 02:42:28.460]  many children's and adults' lives by going on it because it nourishes the brain in a way that
[02:42:28.460 --> 02:42:33.580]  it was designed to be nourished. Because historically through ancient times, we've gone
[02:42:33.580 --> 02:42:37.900]  through these periods of stress so our ancestors all had this metabolic flexibility that
[02:42:37.900 --> 02:42:41.300]  they could nourish their brain with these ketones. And these ketones are not the same
[02:42:41.300 --> 02:42:45.539]  that you get in diabetic ketoacidosis that many people are concerned about. It's two
[02:42:45.580 --> 02:42:52.260]  different animals. I think Atkins helped dispel that myth, but this is a completely
[02:42:52.260 --> 02:42:54.940]  different approach from Atkins. It's high-quality food, it's relatively-
[02:42:54.940 --> 02:42:59.220]  I was about to say that a few times I've done diets like this, I can't handle how
[02:42:59.220 --> 02:43:02.020]  awake I am and how great my brain works. It's almost like too much.
[02:43:02.020 --> 02:43:08.140]  It really is great. You almost don't need the artificial stimulants or the nootropics. It's
[02:43:08.140 --> 02:43:14.460]  just an amazing transition and shift that occurs when your body is functioning the way it was
[02:43:14.460 --> 02:43:19.779]  designed to. It's nothing short of miraculous, it really is. Why don't you optimize your
[02:43:19.779 --> 02:43:20.779]  fuel strategy?
[02:43:20.779 --> 02:43:25.619]  All right, Dr. Mercola, thank you so much for the book, Fat for Fuel, and I really
[02:43:25.619 --> 02:43:28.619]  appreciate the deep research you've done into it. God bless you.
[02:43:28.619 --> 02:43:29.619]  All right.
[02:43:29.619 --> 02:43:34.300]  All right, there he goes. The book is available at infowarsstore.com. And listen, I don't
[02:43:34.300 --> 02:43:38.460]  have a lot of people on about books anymore. And I don't even go and get a lot of books
[02:43:38.460 --> 02:43:44.060]  and sell them. Used to, we'd be selling maybe 70, 80, 100 books a year or more. We
[02:43:44.060 --> 02:43:51.580]  might sell 10 books a year now because I still read a lot, but I already know most
[02:43:51.580 --> 02:43:57.539]  of it and I figure you do too. This book really made me think about things and it's
[02:43:57.539 --> 02:44:01.300]  kind of like working out. You do something for a while, then you change it and you
[02:44:01.300 --> 02:44:05.380]  mix it up. That's how you get real change. That's how you have successful things happen
[02:44:05.380 --> 02:44:10.220]  in your life. You get in this kind of homeostasis you think it was good in your
[02:44:10.220 --> 02:44:14.460]  life, but it's actually stagnation. It's about shaking it up. And I intend to start
[02:44:14.460 --> 02:44:19.500]  doing some fasting because that's something I can actually do. And I've done it before
[02:44:19.500 --> 02:44:22.300]  and it does a lot of just amazing things.
[02:44:22.300 --> 02:44:27.460]  The issue is I can't be here at work because fasting and working does not mix well. I get
[02:44:27.460 --> 02:44:32.980]  pretty angry, but if I'm hanging out at home or just doing stuff with the children,
[02:44:32.980 --> 02:44:36.020]  it's not as big a deal. As long as I can drink water and deal with the stomach
[02:44:36.020 --> 02:44:42.740]  ache, I get day two. But the brain certainly works a lot better than when you're fat, dumb
[02:44:42.740 --> 02:44:46.140]  and happy. That's why they've got terms like that. Okay, I want to go to Jason in
[02:44:46.140 --> 02:44:51.699]  Germany and by the way, everybody that's been holding an hour, you get whatever you
[02:44:51.699 --> 02:44:57.580]  want, a bottle of X2, a bottle of Brainforce, a Trump is my president shirt, whatever
[02:44:57.580 --> 02:45:03.619]  it is, one of the items there on the site that let's say $30 or less, it's all yours.
[02:45:03.619 --> 02:45:07.539]  Let me just briefly mention that since I'm doing this, this is how we fund our operation.
[02:45:07.539 --> 02:45:11.220]  Believe me, we sell a thousand of Mercola's books. That's not going to fund a news organization
[02:45:11.220 --> 02:45:17.779]  of this size. We're doing it with the Memorial Day special that the crew came
[02:45:17.779 --> 02:45:21.560]  up with. And let me tell you, it is one of the biggest specials ever. We've been
[02:45:21.560 --> 02:45:29.500]  having a lot of big specials. We're talking 65% off silver bullet colloidal silver. We've
[02:45:29.500 --> 02:45:34.580]  never done that. And this has been sold out for a while. This stuff just came back in.
[02:45:34.580 --> 02:45:39.060]  We can sell this full retail, but I believe in having incredible discounts and high quality
[02:45:39.060 --> 02:45:44.539]  products so that you repeat customer want to support us and sign up for auto ship.
[02:45:44.539 --> 02:45:49.640]  You get an additional 10% off on everything in the store. When you sign up for auto
[02:45:49.640 --> 02:45:56.460]  ship, that makes the global silver a loss leader. And by the way, I said almost everything,
[02:45:56.460 --> 02:46:01.380]  some things you get a 25% off on the entire line. When you sign up for auto ship on
[02:46:01.380 --> 02:46:09.940]  in Rick's essentials, a personal care products like high quality, non aluminum deodorant,
[02:46:09.940 --> 02:46:20.820]  non nano zinc based high quality sunscreen, 10 to one concentrate, organic mouthwash
[02:46:20.820 --> 02:46:28.420]  wash shampoo, and so much more bug spray, all natural info wars, life.com or triple
[02:46:28.420 --> 02:46:33.980]  eight to five, three, three, one three nine. And I'm going to have to end that 25% off
[02:46:33.980 --> 02:46:37.460]  on auto ship soon because they kind of showed me the map, the math the other day.
[02:46:37.460 --> 02:46:41.420]  And we're not making enough money to operate. This is one of our main products for selling
[02:46:41.420 --> 02:46:47.320]  and I'm doing 45% off total. When you do the auto ships, 25% off auto ship, 20% off
[02:46:47.320 --> 02:46:51.000]  retail. So that limited time introductory offers going to have to end probably the next
[02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:55.240]  week or so take advantage of it. Info war store.com or triple eight to five, three,
[02:46:55.240 --> 02:47:01.119]  three, one three nine. But I'm going to Jason in Germany. Just first, we are very
[02:47:01.119 --> 02:47:08.940]  excited to announce this new mega special that we're running on the biggest specials
[02:47:08.940 --> 02:47:20.699]  basically ever at info wars, life.com. And that is silver bullet, 65% off super

[02:47:34.260 --> 02:47:42.619]  methylcobalamin knockout, 50% off. You cannot beat that all Trump info war shirts, 75% off
[02:47:42.619 --> 02:47:48.699]  info war store.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[02:47:48.699 --> 02:47:53.580]  And again, ladies and gentlemen, I'm changing my life. I'm not up here on some high horse
[02:47:53.580 --> 02:47:57.160]  lecturing you about how to be healthy. I just know an antibiotics haven't worked
[02:47:57.160 --> 02:48:01.699]  for me. I drink a whole bottle of oil silver, which by the way is toxic. The government
[02:48:01.699 --> 02:48:05.779]  says small amounts of it are okay. And grass certified and all this stuff, consult your
[02:48:05.779 --> 02:48:10.779]  own physician. I just know when antibiotics don't work for me or my family, I take heroic
[02:48:10.779 --> 02:48:13.940]  doses of colloidal silver. I'm not saying you should do that. I'm just saying it's
[02:48:13.940 --> 02:48:17.580]  something good to have in your cupboard topically, you name it, silver put the elites
[02:48:17.580 --> 02:48:20.940]  eat off of for a reason. It's been well known for thousands of years and now it's
[02:48:20.940 --> 02:48:25.580]  been proven an antivirus antibacterial and other stuff isn't working. Does it mean it works
[02:48:25.580 --> 02:48:34.539]  every time that experience of yourself is the reason they call it in Laura silver bullet
[02:48:34.539 --> 02:48:40.340]  associated with warding off evil info wars live.com or triple eight, two, five, three,
[02:48:40.340 --> 02:48:45.539]  three, one, three, nine is the wives tales are all archetypes of the truth that a problem
[02:48:45.539 --> 02:48:51.640]  of the werewolf or a vampire silver info wars live.com play that like Jones believes
[02:48:51.640 --> 02:48:59.720]  in werewolves. It's a parallel, an allegory, a parable, an example, a comparison, an analogy.
[02:48:59.720 --> 02:49:04.560]  I don't mean literal. If you're somebody kidnapped the devil worshiper dead with world
[02:49:04.560 --> 02:49:09.119]  leaders, right? But a five year old, I mean, I guess vampires are real, aren't they? They
[02:49:09.119 --> 02:49:15.400]  just don't live forever, except in hell. I'm sorry. Let's go to Jason in Deutschland.
[02:49:15.400 --> 02:49:20.520]  Jason, give us your address if you want it. We're shipping you whatever you want of one of
[02:49:20.520 --> 02:49:26.640]  those items. Thanks for holding one of your marvelous people there. By the way, I don't
[02:49:26.640 --> 02:49:29.760]  just call it a bug. You ever once in a while, I actually do use your products. These X
[02:49:29.760 --> 02:49:34.279]  to every day defense and the silver bullet and love it. I would actually buy more except
[02:49:34.279 --> 02:49:37.840]  as the guy from Scotland said, you just almost can't get it here. In fact, they
[02:49:37.840 --> 02:49:40.640]  did that custom. They won't even give it to me. So I have to go Stateside actually
[02:49:40.640 --> 02:49:45.240]  re up. Oh yeah. I mean, that's another problem that's killed us. We still ship
[02:49:45.240 --> 02:49:50.240]  overseas 20, 30% of the stuff we ship overseas and we don't even get a letter back.
[02:49:50.240 --> 02:49:54.560]  They just tear it open, steal it, throw it in the trash. We've been told this by customs
[02:49:54.560 --> 02:49:59.000]  agents overseas. I mean, they're out to get us. That's why I stopped ordering. I didn't
[02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:02.000]  want to put you guys through that, but also real quick, I wrote an article. I don't
[02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:06.560]  know if you guys take user submissions, but I sent that to both the writers and a show
[02:50:06.560 --> 02:50:10.920]  tip that info wars.com. If you guys are able to review that real quick about the
[02:50:10.920 --> 02:50:14.039]  terror attack, I think it's important to understand exactly what we're dealing with
[02:50:14.039 --> 02:50:18.720]  here. And it's just like you said earlier, it's trauma based mind control. That's what
[02:50:18.720 --> 02:50:26.400]  it is. And explain that to people. Well, I think the elite are using terror as a way
[02:50:26.400 --> 02:50:30.119]  to make us feel helpless and then basically put us in a position to beg them for their
[02:50:30.119 --> 02:50:35.800]  1984 style control grid, which ironically will actually not even keep us safe or just
[02:50:35.800 --> 02:50:40.600]  as bad make us feel outraged enough to actually take it to the streets and then
[02:50:40.600 --> 02:50:45.619]  use that as a pretext for bringing in a draconian kind of surveillance state. And we need
[02:50:45.619 --> 02:50:49.060]  to be careful not to play into that because that is the game they're playing. And there
[02:50:49.060 --> 02:50:52.900]  are many ways to skin a cat and we are the cat in the situation. All right, well, hey,
[02:50:52.900 --> 02:50:55.740]  send us a resume. You should be a radio host for us. I'm about to launch a larger
[02:50:55.740 --> 02:50:58.939]  radio network. I'll work with GCN if they want to. Thank you, Jason.

[02:54:01.380 --> 02:54:12.020]  I can see for miles and miles and miles and miles and miles...
[02:54:12.020 --> 02:54:15.699]  Okay folks, we're back. I'm gonna do this segment the next and then Paul Watson from
[02:54:15.699 --> 02:54:19.860]  London. We'll have a lot more on the bombing and the attack. And again, we know the globalists
[02:54:19.860 --> 02:54:24.180]  working with Islam. We know they're bringing them in. It's just to watch the media cover it
[02:54:24.180 --> 02:54:28.740]  up and then demonize anybody that exposes it and then act like it's our fault because we
[02:54:28.740 --> 02:54:31.939]  don't submit to Islam. This is happening. It just makes me angry.
[02:54:33.619 --> 02:54:36.820]  And I don't want to kill the Muslims. I don't want to be in wars with them.
[02:54:36.820 --> 02:54:42.180]  But our governments overthrow the secular governments and then put the baddies in.
[02:54:42.180 --> 02:54:44.900]  So I hope Saudi Arabia has turned some corner with Trump.
[02:54:46.260 --> 02:54:48.820]  If Trump delivers, I'll be happy. If he doesn't, I'm gonna hate him.
[02:54:49.619 --> 02:54:53.860]  But it all remains to be seen. O'Brien in Maryland. You're on the air. Thanks for holding.
[02:54:53.860 --> 02:54:54.360]  Go ahead.
[02:54:57.300 --> 02:55:05.460]  Yeah, basically what we have to also look at is the fact that basically they actually warn,
[02:55:06.020 --> 02:55:11.140]  they keep telling us that basically this is all going to happen and it just keeps happening.
[02:55:11.140 --> 02:55:18.100]  It's almost like having someone say, I'm going to do this, this, this and the president...
[02:55:18.100 --> 02:55:22.420]  That's right. Al Qaeda and ISIS say, you're letting us in. We're going to kill you.
[02:55:22.420 --> 02:55:25.860]  When they do kill us, our government says, don't worry. We'll teach school girls how
[02:55:25.860 --> 02:55:29.779]  to wear hajibs. That'll fix it. So what do you think is happening? I think it's mass
[02:55:29.779 --> 02:55:33.300]  mind control, trauma-based mind control, like the last caller from Germany said.
[02:55:34.660 --> 02:55:36.180]  And that's exactly what it is.
[02:55:39.060 --> 02:55:42.820]  God bless you, O'Brien. You know, I'll tell you, I was thinking about the last caller.
[02:55:42.820 --> 02:55:45.140]  I was saying, hey, you're in Germany. I'm going to send you a free bottle of something
[02:55:45.140 --> 02:55:48.340]  for holding over an hour. It's a good promo on air, but it also, I feel bad for
[02:55:48.340 --> 02:55:52.180]  folks who've been holding too long. And someone encouraged good callers to call in.
[02:55:52.180 --> 02:55:56.260]  And it's uncool what I do sometimes. Let's just be honest. But I get caught up in the time and
[02:55:56.260 --> 02:56:00.980]  the gas and everything else. I was thinking about why did I ever get an Amazon account,
[02:56:00.980 --> 02:56:04.500]  even though they bend you over the barrel and make you pay them huge percentages,
[02:56:04.500 --> 02:56:09.939]  it's not even profitable. And it's because we never have problems shipping Amazon packages
[02:56:09.939 --> 02:56:15.060]  into Russia or into Germany or into Japan or into Mexico or into wherever.
[02:56:15.060 --> 02:56:20.740]  But Canada and the EU really are horrible. And they grab your stuff and make you come
[02:56:20.740 --> 02:56:26.020]  get it from customs with a 90% markup. America doesn't do that to other people's stuff.
[02:56:26.020 --> 02:56:30.980]  It's so uncool to that extent that there's some tariffs, some regulations.
[02:56:32.580 --> 02:56:37.060]  I just thought that's why I should be on Amazon. But see, Amazon's the globalist. It's
[02:56:37.060 --> 02:56:41.460]  the big company. It gives money to the foreign governments. It's liberal.
[02:56:41.460 --> 02:56:46.420]  So it gets to ship in and not get torn open and not have all the fees added on most of the time.
[02:56:46.600 --> 02:56:53.000]  Because we'll fill out the forms right, we'll do it all, we'll do it through FedEx, you
[02:56:53.000 --> 02:56:55.680]  name it, they tear it open a third of the time.
[02:56:55.680 --> 02:56:57.240]  They steal it.
[02:56:57.240 --> 02:57:02.560]  And don't even send it back to us.
[02:57:02.560 --> 02:57:07.640]  So I just throw product up against a wall, but I still just do it.
[02:57:07.700 --> 02:57:16.940]  So I'm pig-headed, but maybe I should just roll over to Amazon and be anti-gun, anti-family,
[02:57:16.940 --> 02:57:21.100]  chop my balls off, just worship world government.
[02:57:21.100 --> 02:57:25.380]  I mean, I'm sorry to talk like that, it's just, at a certain point, it's just, why
[02:57:25.380 --> 02:57:28.620]  are the people running things so uncool?
[02:57:28.620 --> 02:57:32.380]  Because they're greedy bastards, that's why.
[02:57:32.380 --> 02:57:37.100]  Dan in Indiana, thanks for holding your own the year.
[02:57:37.100 --> 02:57:38.100]  Hello.
[02:57:38.100 --> 02:57:39.100]  Hey brother.
[02:57:39.100 --> 02:57:40.100]  Yeah.
[02:57:40.100 --> 02:57:41.100]  Yeah.
[02:57:41.100 --> 02:57:48.820]  I want to say, this is Dan Sanders, not Alex Jones or President Trump, but it is time
[02:57:48.820 --> 02:57:57.340]  for eye for eye, and let God sort out the terrorists from the innocent, because it's
[02:57:57.340 --> 02:58:03.060]  time for the British people to get up some balls and go out there and start lynching
[02:58:03.060 --> 02:58:04.780]  these bastards.
[02:58:04.780 --> 02:58:11.900]  Well, I know this, your phone's breaking up real bad, but I hear what you're saying.
[02:58:11.900 --> 02:58:14.900]  How about just go after the known Islamic leaders calling for violence?
[02:58:14.900 --> 02:58:16.900]  How about that?
[02:58:16.900 --> 02:58:28.220]  They need to go out and be men and take some swords or whatever they have and fight
[02:58:28.220 --> 02:58:31.700]  to the fence, you know, because they're being walked all over.
[02:58:31.700 --> 02:58:35.820]  No, I hear you, Dan, and I mean, I'm not saying we should do that, but the point is
[02:58:35.820 --> 02:58:39.620]  if the government doesn't respond, it's going to lead to that point, Dan.
[02:58:39.620 --> 02:58:43.060]  Stay there, we're going to get your info if you want to get a t-shirt or X2 or
[02:58:43.060 --> 02:58:44.060]  whatever you want.
[02:58:44.060 --> 02:58:45.060]  Thanks for holding.
[02:58:45.060 --> 02:58:47.540]  We're going to come back in the third, fourth hour, I'm going to finish up with Trevor
[02:58:47.540 --> 02:58:48.540]  and Cindy.
[02:58:48.540 --> 02:58:51.380]  I mean, Dan asked the big question everybody's asking.
[02:58:51.380 --> 02:58:55.540]  Info Wars has partnered with Defender Body Armor to bring you a new state of the art
[02:58:55.540 --> 02:58:59.300]  line of advanced, highly tested body armor from infowarsetour.com.
[02:58:59.740 --> 02:59:03.820]  Defender Body Armor is certified to protect against all handgun rounds and even armor piercing
[02:59:03.820 --> 02:59:06.060]  FN 5.7 pistol rounds.
[02:59:06.060 --> 02:59:10.960]  The secret to Defender Body Armor is this proprietary process and technology that disperses
[02:59:10.960 --> 02:59:14.780]  more kinetic energy at a rate higher than any other traditional body armor.
[02:59:14.780 --> 02:59:19.020]  Using one of the strongest synthetic materials ever created called ultra high molecular
[02:59:19.020 --> 02:59:23.700]  weight polyethylene, Defender Armor is also super compact and lightweight.
[02:59:23.700 --> 02:59:27.800]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line
[02:59:27.800 --> 02:59:29.720]  of advanced, lightweight armor.
[02:59:29.720 --> 02:59:30.720]  It works.
[02:59:30.720 --> 02:59:34.440]  Defender Body Armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level
[02:59:34.440 --> 02:59:39.240]  ballistic resistance certification from an authorized NIJ ballistic laboratory.
[02:59:39.240 --> 02:59:43.880]  Defender Body Armor is now available through infowarsetour.com so you can defend yourself,
[02:59:43.880 --> 02:59:48.560]  your family, and finance the info war against the globalists all at the same time.
[02:59:48.560 --> 02:59:49.880]  A total 360 win.
[02:59:50.900 --> 02:59:56.660]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:58.300 --> 03:00:23.660]  Again, it's not the Muslims, it's this big collapse, this big setup, this big waging
[03:00:23.660 --> 03:00:25.060]  war on corruption.
[03:00:25.060 --> 03:00:26.060]  Clash!
[03:00:26.060 --> 03:00:32.220]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:00:32.220 --> 03:00:35.340]  I mean who could think this up, like aliens that run the planet and it's like a crazy
[03:00:35.340 --> 03:00:39.460]  video game where there's a planet and then you give like super backwards people that
[03:00:39.460 --> 03:00:43.859]  have women as slaves and run sex slavery, half the oil on the planet and the British
[03:00:43.859 --> 03:00:48.740]  find it and then make them the richest people in the world and then now they're like sending
[03:00:48.740 --> 03:00:51.820]  out people all over the world as missionaries that blow you up and kill you.
[03:00:51.900 --> 03:00:59.020]  And look, other orthodox religions have done bad things as well. I don't want to kill Muslims.
[03:00:59.020 --> 03:01:03.380]  I just know that our governments are working with them and allowing this to happen and
[03:01:03.380 --> 03:01:08.340]  it's wrong and those of us that criticize it are attacked. I used to be brainwashed
[03:01:08.340 --> 03:01:13.100]  15 years ago. We'll get mad if you criticize Muslims. I knew they were backward and had
[03:01:13.100 --> 03:01:17.420]  problems but I didn't want to go bomb them and stuff. I guess I was right because that
[03:01:17.420 --> 03:01:22.100]  stirred them up but there was a larger plan. The same people bombing them are the ones
[03:01:22.100 --> 03:01:26.619]  putting the radicals in charge and then opening our borders up to them. So what's the big
[03:01:26.619 --> 03:01:32.140]  master plan? Trevor in Canada, then Cindy in Pennsylvania. Trevor, you're on the air.
[03:01:32.140 --> 03:01:35.619]  Hey Alex, how are you doing? Good, brother.
[03:01:35.619 --> 03:01:42.180]  Hey, I just want to chat about how on earth do you have a reformation in Islam when
[03:01:42.180 --> 03:01:47.859]  the roots of it are so poisonous? There's been reformations like the Taliban, Al Qaeda
[03:01:47.859 --> 03:01:52.100]  and all that stuff. I don't understand how you can reform something that has poisonous
[03:01:52.100 --> 03:01:58.740]  roots to it. No, I hear you. I mean, I got to be honest with you. So what do we
[03:01:58.740 --> 03:02:02.740]  do? I mean, you got a billion and a half of these people. What do you do?
[03:02:02.740 --> 03:02:10.420]  That's the real question. Anything that doesn't coincide with Western values is something
[03:02:10.420 --> 03:02:15.580]  that shouldn't be around. Well, here's the deal. They could have their countries. It's
[03:02:15.580 --> 03:02:19.460]  just that they're obsessed with taking everything over. That's why they're constantly killing
[03:02:19.460 --> 03:02:23.920]  each other because they're not an open, free society. Then they use our openness
[03:02:23.920 --> 03:02:27.699]  and our freedom to ally with the left and then try to get rid of our openness
[03:02:27.699 --> 03:02:32.900]  and freedom. It's just there's no logic to the feminists and people, except they're
[03:02:32.900 --> 03:02:38.619]  just a bunch of white flag cowards. Well, no kidding. Look, they're with them promoting
[03:02:38.820 --> 03:02:44.060]  the Hijab and everything when the Hijab's origin were to differentiate between your
[03:02:44.060 --> 03:02:47.420]  wives and your sex slaves. I don't understand how they could promote something like that
[03:02:47.420 --> 03:02:51.020]  as a feminist, so-called. That's right. For folks that don't know the history,
[03:02:51.020 --> 03:02:54.060]  why don't you tell them about the difference between a wife and a sex slave who wore what?
[03:02:54.060 --> 03:03:00.940]  I forget which is which. I believe it was the sex slaves that wore the Hijab. I
[03:03:00.940 --> 03:03:05.340]  can't remember off the top of my head, to be honest. But either way, it's a symbol
[03:03:05.340 --> 03:03:10.619]  of oppression. And I don't understand, especially with what it's referring to,
[03:03:10.619 --> 03:03:15.340]  between differentiating between wives and sex slaves. Well, imagine if a black guy or
[03:03:15.340 --> 03:03:20.380]  Hispanic guy or a white guy, Christian, whatever, said, you're going to wear a hood over your head.
[03:03:20.380 --> 03:03:23.980]  I'm going to cut your genitals off. People put you in prison and say, oh,
[03:03:23.980 --> 03:03:29.340]  he had his wife as a slave. What? I mean, it's like ridiculous. We should reject it.
[03:03:29.340 --> 03:03:33.660]  Thank you, Trevor. Great points. Cindy in Pennsylvania, you're on the air.
[03:03:33.660 --> 03:03:39.740]  Hi. Hi, Alex. Thanks for taking my call. Thank you. Thanks for that
[03:03:40.940 --> 03:03:45.180]  segment with Tommy Robinson. What amazing bravery that man has.
[03:03:47.180 --> 03:03:52.380]  We all need to get behind him. I've been racking my brain because he's in so much danger.
[03:03:52.380 --> 03:03:59.020]  I mean, I watched him with the frustration in him. It just made me cry. But I had one idea
[03:03:59.580 --> 03:04:05.900]  of a T-shirt, Tommy Robinson, with a picture of his face with it begins with one.
[03:04:06.460 --> 03:04:09.580]  I'm not a rich person, but if I was, I will put that out.
[03:04:10.699 --> 03:04:15.100]  Oh, with Robinson, doesn't the sincerity come right across very, very strong? And he's,
[03:04:15.100 --> 03:04:17.900]  he really has been the Paul Revere in the UK in the last 15 years.
[03:04:18.100 --> 03:04:48.100]  Thank you so much for joining us, and we'll see you next time.
[03:04:48.100 --> 03:04:55.100]  Thank you so much for joining us, and we'll see you next time.

[03:05:48.100 --> 03:05:54.100]  Thank you so much for joining us, and we'll see you next time.

[03:06:25.100 --> 03:06:27.100]  It is a classical 360 win.
[03:06:27.100 --> 03:06:37.100]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[03:06:37.100 --> 03:06:46.100]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be.

[03:07:54.100 --> 03:08:00.100]  We didn't ask for this fight, but we're in this fight. This is the time to support InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:08:10.100 --> 03:08:27.100]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover us. You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he. Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:08:27.100 --> 03:08:41.100]  We are live, fourth hour of the Alex Jones show with me, Paul Joseph Watts, and now obviously we've spoken at length about the tragedy that happened last night in Manchester, England.
[03:08:41.100 --> 03:08:48.100]  We're going to get more into that. We're also going to cover the situation in Libya or just off the coast of Libya.
[03:08:48.100 --> 03:08:52.100]  And this is what most people don't realize about the, quote, refugee crisis.
[03:08:52.100 --> 03:09:01.100]  It's not a refugee crisis. Most people hold up the refugee welcome signs. They don't even scratch one inch below the surface.
[03:09:01.100 --> 03:09:10.100]  We're talking about these NGO boats literally going 12 miles off the coast of Libya to pick up migrants,
[03:09:10.100 --> 03:09:25.100]  some of whom have been paid by ISIS to cover their fee that they pay the people smugglers to get across the Mediterranean with the NGOs being in illegal communication with the people smugglers.
[03:09:25.100 --> 03:09:36.100]  Most people have no idea that this is going on. It's something that we can stop if we know the details, if we support the parties that are trying to stop it there in Italy.
[03:09:36.100 --> 03:09:42.100]  So I'm going to get into a detailed breakdown about that. And obviously we're talking about what happened in Manchester.
[03:09:42.100 --> 03:09:50.100]  Now, to set the table for Manchester, this video just went up about an hour ago on YouTube and on Infowars.com.
[03:09:50.100 --> 03:09:54.100]  It is Manchester attack, what they're not telling you. Here's the video.
[03:09:54.100 --> 03:10:03.100]  Europe has been hit with yet another terrorist atrocity after at least 22 people were killed in an attack on the Manchester arena claimed by ISIS.
[03:10:03.100 --> 03:10:11.100]  The second attack on the UK in the space of two months, victims, many of them teenage girls massacred, mutilated, maimed.
[03:10:11.100 --> 03:10:22.100]  Why does this keep happening? Because our political class has demoted the most basic role of government to protect the lives of its people and replaced it with a different role.
[03:10:22.100 --> 03:10:30.100]  Tolerance. Tolerance of women being abused and harassed on the street. Tolerance of rape gangs abducting and abusing young girls for years.
[03:10:30.100 --> 03:10:39.100]  Tolerance of all the barbarisms of Sharia law. Tolerance of terrorist attacks. Tolerance is now more important than the basic right to life.
[03:10:39.100 --> 03:10:46.100]  Tolerance. Tolerance of terror being part and parcel of living in a major city, according to London Mercedes-Benz.
[03:10:46.100 --> 03:10:49.100]  Europe is getting used to attacks like this, Mika. We have to.
[03:10:49.100 --> 03:10:54.100]  There's only one way Britain should respond to attacks such as Manchester. That is by carrying on exactly as before.
[03:10:54.100 --> 03:11:01.100]  Just carry on. Forget about it. Be tolerant until it happens again and again and again.
[03:11:01.100 --> 03:11:06.100]  Tell me, how do the parents of dead kids just carry on exactly as before?
[03:11:06.100 --> 03:11:12.100]  How do the teenage girls whose legs have been blown off just carry on exactly as before?
[03:11:12.100 --> 03:11:18.100]  As much as I'm praying for Manchester, I'm praying for Muslims who have to deal with racism and Islamophobia due to this tragedy.
[03:11:18.100 --> 03:11:25.100]  Right, so that's what our main concern should be after dozens of children have been blown up. People being mean to Muslims.
[03:11:25.100 --> 03:11:35.100]  As a society, we need to make a choice. Which do we value more? Protecting the feelings of Muslims or preventing our children from being blown up?
[03:11:35.100 --> 03:11:41.100]  Muslims are to blame, when in reality Muslim taxi drivers are offering free lifts than a Muslim doctor working into the night saving lives.
[03:11:41.100 --> 03:11:50.100]  Yeah, the fact that some Muslim taxi drivers are offering free lifts doesn't negate the fact that Islam has a problem with violence, you utter moron.
[03:11:50.100 --> 03:11:56.100]  Islamophobia and sickening fake news is right. Tonight is showing a lot of people to be vile humans.
[03:11:56.100 --> 03:12:02.100]  Yeah, vile humans follow a belief system that justifies massacring teenagers at a pop concert.
[03:12:02.100 --> 03:12:08.100]  Should we concentrate on stopping them or be more angry at inaccurate tweets?
[03:12:08.100 --> 03:12:13.100]  Seeing all the posts about Manchester just reminds me of how we only notice it if it happens to white people.
[03:12:13.100 --> 03:12:21.100]  Right, so the main complaint should be all those disgusting white people demanding attention for being slaughtered. How dare they?
[03:12:21.100 --> 03:12:27.100]  And in these times of our children being blown to bits by terrorists, it's vital to point out the real danger.
[03:12:27.100 --> 03:12:33.100]  Katie Hopkins' offensive tweets. Being angry at Tommy Robinson. That's more important.
[03:12:33.100 --> 03:12:41.100]  I've come to realize that a lot of this hashtag pray for whatever concern signaling is worse than glib. It's repugnant narcissism.
[03:12:41.100 --> 03:12:55.100]  People who see something horrible happen in the world, and they run to the internet, and they run to their social media, their Facebook, their Twitter, whatever they got, and they all write down the exact same thing.
[03:12:55.100 --> 03:13:07.100]  My thoughts and prayers. My thoughts and prayers with the people in Aurora. My thoughts and prayers with the families in Boston.
[03:13:07.100 --> 03:13:20.100]  Do you know what that's worth? **** nothing. **** less than nothing. Less than nothing.
[03:13:21.100 --> 03:13:31.100]  You are not giving any of your time, your money, or even your compassion. All you are doing, all you are doing is saying, don't forget about me today.
[03:13:31.100 --> 03:13:37.100]  Your thoughts and prayers count for nothing. CNN's Jake Tapper posting a Union Jack.
[03:13:37.100 --> 03:13:45.100]  Hey Jake, I don't recall you posting a Russian flag when all those innocent people got blown up in the St. Petersburg subway last month.
[03:13:45.100 --> 03:13:51.100]  Was political correctness to blame for one of the accomplices in the attack escaping detection?
[03:13:51.100 --> 03:13:57.100]  This eyewitness says she spotted a woman acting suspiciously and told security, but they did nothing.
[03:13:57.100 --> 03:14:05.100]  Looked very suspicious. She was fidgeting all the time with a bag on the floor across her. She was by herself.
[03:14:05.100 --> 03:14:07.100]  What was she doing?
[03:14:07.100 --> 03:14:14.100]  She was looking in the direction of where the explosion actually happened all night and smirking to herself.
[03:14:14.100 --> 03:14:19.100]  The suspicious individual was hard to understand, suggesting English wasn't her first language.
[03:14:19.100 --> 03:14:26.100]  The woman who reported the incident was then lectured for making the suspicious individual feel uncomfortable.
[03:14:26.100 --> 03:14:32.100]  How would you like it if someone accused you of this? We look into it and nothing was done about it.
[03:14:32.100 --> 03:14:38.100]  One to two minutes before the concert finished, this lady disappeared and then, of course, the explosion went off.
[03:14:38.100 --> 03:14:47.100]  Is she suggesting that security did nothing because the suspicious individual was Muslim and to ask her to leave would have been politically incorrect?
[03:14:47.100 --> 03:14:52.100]  We'll never know. What we do know is this. Almost certainly, nothing will change.
[03:14:52.100 --> 03:15:01.100]  There are things we can change. Mass surveillance of hate preaching mosques, solitary confinement of individuals who are likely to radicalize others in prison,
[03:15:01.100 --> 03:15:05.100]  extreme vetting and strict quotas on Muslim immigration,
[03:15:05.100 --> 03:15:16.100]  deporting known terrorists, prosecuting NGOs who send out boats to rescue un-vetted migrants, some of whom sympathize with or are members of ISIS.
[03:15:16.100 --> 03:15:26.100]  But again, nothing is going to change because we have a political class and a culture that deems her feelings to be of more concern than mangled, dead children.
[03:15:26.100 --> 03:15:33.100]  90% of terror victims are Muslims killed by other Muslims. This is the culture we're importing.
[03:15:33.100 --> 03:15:39.100]  Just 34% of British Muslims would inform police if they knew someone was getting involved with ISIS.
[03:15:39.100 --> 03:15:46.100]  32% refused to condemn those who take part in violence against those who mock the Prophet Mohammed.
[03:15:46.100 --> 03:15:52.100]  One in four British Muslims believe that the 7-7 attacks in London were justified.
[03:15:52.100 --> 03:16:01.100]  ISIS fighters are returning from Syria and flooding into Europe en masse under cover of the refugee wave and European countries are welcoming them in.
[03:16:01.100 --> 03:16:09.100]  Because tolerance. This is tolerance. This is diversity. This is the future our leaders have chosen for us.
[03:16:09.100 --> 03:16:14.100]  But we have a choice. We have hope. Don't let them tell you not to be angry.
[03:16:14.100 --> 03:16:21.100]  Don't let them tell you to just go on with life as normal because that's not bravery. It's cowardice.
[03:16:21.100 --> 03:16:28.100]  Enough hashtags. Enough vigils. Enough celebrity platitudes. It hasn't worked.
[03:16:28.100 --> 03:16:35.100]  We need change. We need action. Hope has two beautiful daughters. Their names are anger and courage.
[03:16:35.100 --> 03:16:42.100]  Anger at the way things are and courage to see that they do not remain as they are.
[03:16:43.100 --> 03:16:47.100]  And that is what they're not telling you about the Manchester attack.
[03:16:47.100 --> 03:16:57.100]  Now, I mentioned there in the video, everyone made a huge deal about, oh, there were some Muslim taxi drivers who were offering free lifts to the people trying to get home after that tragedy.
[03:16:57.100 --> 03:17:03.100]  Now, I'm sure there were some that were offering free lifts. But Cosmopolitan took this.
[03:17:03.100 --> 03:17:09.100]  They put out a tweet. And if you go onto my Twitter page, you can scroll down. It's on there as of about an hour ago.
[03:17:09.100 --> 03:17:17.100]  They put out a tweet with a picture of a Sikh man saying that he was a Muslim offering free lifts.
[03:17:17.100 --> 03:17:21.100]  Now, you could understand if they were just stupid and they're mistaking a Sikh for a Muslim.
[03:17:21.100 --> 03:17:25.100]  It's pretty easy to tell based on the headgear.
[03:17:25.100 --> 03:17:30.100]  But they asked the originator of this photo for permission to use it.
[03:17:30.100 --> 03:17:36.100]  And in the original tweet that this Sikh guy posted, he said he was a Sikh.
[03:17:36.100 --> 03:17:42.100]  Cosmopolitan deliberately twisted that. They took it and claimed he was a Muslim.
[03:17:42.100 --> 03:17:47.100]  Again, because virtue signaling about Muslims and Islamophobia, that's the main concern.
[03:17:47.100 --> 03:17:58.100]  That's the numero-umero thing that everybody has to do after an Islamic terrorist has slaughtered 22 people, 23 people and maimed dozens more.
[03:17:58.100 --> 03:18:01.100]  That is the most important thing.
[03:18:01.100 --> 03:18:12.100]  You know, just imagine if some of these leftists got as irate about Islamic terrorism as they did, oh, I don't know, people with opinions with which they don't agree.
[03:18:12.100 --> 03:18:22.100]  Remember Antifa, remember Berkeley, remember the absolute bedlam that takes place when anyone dares express an opinion that goes against their leftist consensus.
[03:18:22.100 --> 03:18:25.100]  They go absolutely ape.
[03:18:25.100 --> 03:18:30.100]  When something like this happens, no, we're bad, we're bad for talking about Islam.
[03:18:30.100 --> 03:18:32.100]  I'll give you another example.
[03:18:32.100 --> 03:18:47.100]  Somebody put out a tweet earlier which said, bearing in mind as we talked about earlier, Katie Hopkins is literally under police investigation for a tweet which basically said we need men to stand up against Islamic terrorism.
[03:18:47.100 --> 03:18:49.100]  That's basically all that it said.
[03:18:49.100 --> 03:18:52.100]  She's under police investigation for that now.
[03:18:52.100 --> 03:18:54.100]  They're visiting mosques, okay.
[03:18:54.100 --> 03:19:05.100]  This bomber came from Wally Range in Manchester which is an area that has, an area of Manchester that has four mosques, Wally Range.
[03:19:05.100 --> 03:19:10.100]  Two girls that went to Syria to join ISIS also came out of that area.
[03:19:10.100 --> 03:19:13.100]  So are the police going to be putting surveillance on those mosques?
[03:19:13.100 --> 03:19:19.100]  Are they going to be going to those mosques and finding out if they played a role in radicalizing this individual?
[03:19:19.100 --> 03:19:28.100]  Well, not today it seems like because they're traveling around mosques checking if the people in the mosques are being attacked if they're safe.
[03:19:28.100 --> 03:19:30.100]  Now, no one's advocating attacks on mosques.
[03:19:30.100 --> 03:19:31.100]  That's ridiculous.
[03:19:31.100 --> 03:19:32.100]  That's just as bad.
[03:19:32.100 --> 03:19:35.100]  You don't fight extremism with extremism.
[03:19:35.100 --> 03:19:45.100]  But for their primary concern to be quote hate speech, and they've come out on Twitter, all these different police bodies and said we will not tolerate hate speech.
[03:19:45.100 --> 03:19:49.100]  That was their first primary concern immediately after this attack.
[03:19:49.100 --> 03:19:52.100]  It is every single time.
[03:19:52.100 --> 03:20:03.100]  Because these councils are controlled by leftists, the same kind of people who ignored the ritual abuse of children for years and years in places like Rotherham.
[03:20:03.100 --> 03:20:10.100]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[03:20:10.100 --> 03:20:18.100]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[03:20:18.100 --> 03:20:24.100]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[03:20:24.100 --> 03:20:28.100]  My blood pressure has normalized, my diabetes has totally improved.
[03:20:28.100 --> 03:20:32.100]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[03:20:32.100 --> 03:20:35.100]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[03:20:35.100 --> 03:20:43.100]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[03:23:58.500 --> 03:24:23.420]  So again, we have this narrative put out by the left after every single terrorist attack.
[03:24:23.420 --> 03:24:25.900]  Oh, but what about Islamophobia?
[03:24:25.900 --> 03:24:27.900]  What about people being mean to Muslims?
[03:24:27.900 --> 03:24:31.580]  That is the first thing they come out with every single time.
[03:24:31.580 --> 03:24:35.320]  They also come out with, oh, why are you blaming all Muslims?
[03:24:35.320 --> 03:24:37.220]  No one's blaming all Muslims!
[03:24:37.220 --> 03:24:41.060]  Why do they constantly insist that that's what we're saying?
[03:24:41.060 --> 03:24:42.820]  I've never said that.
[03:24:42.820 --> 03:24:46.660]  It's self-evident that that's not the case, statistically.
[03:24:46.660 --> 03:24:51.700]  But it's also self-evident statistically that many of these people have extreme beliefs
[03:24:51.700 --> 03:24:53.540]  and it is a problem.
[03:24:53.540 --> 03:24:56.520]  Islam has a problem with violence, okay?
[03:24:56.520 --> 03:25:04.440]  When 32% say it's justifiable to commit terrorist attacks if it's in revenge for insulting the
[03:25:04.440 --> 03:25:05.440]  prophet.
[03:25:05.440 --> 03:25:08.800]  32% of British Muslims think that.
[03:25:08.800 --> 03:25:10.280]  That is a problem.
[03:25:10.280 --> 03:25:15.760]  When one in four British Muslims say the 7-7 attacks in London, which killed 50-odd
[03:25:15.760 --> 03:25:18.880]  people, are justifiable, that is a problem.
[03:25:18.880 --> 03:25:23.360]  That's something we need to have a national conversation about without leftists coming
[03:25:23.360 --> 03:25:27.440]  in immediately and saying, you're a racist, you're an Islamophobe, even though Islam is
[03:25:27.440 --> 03:25:31.240]  not a race, and that you're saying all Muslims are responsible.
[03:25:31.240 --> 03:25:33.240]  Nobody's saying that.
[03:25:33.240 --> 03:25:38.240]  Only complete idiots would claim that, so why do they try to create that straw man?
[03:25:38.240 --> 03:25:44.120]  Well, it's a deceptive tactic to shut down debate because, again, they cannot tolerate
[03:25:44.120 --> 03:25:49.540]  the fact that Islam is not a progressive belief system, yet they still have to embrace
[03:25:49.540 --> 03:25:53.580]  it anyway because it's all about the oppression Olympics.
[03:25:53.580 --> 03:25:57.880]  Now this is a tweet that was said about me about two hours ago, just to give you another
[03:25:57.880 --> 03:26:03.380]  example of the sheer idiocy that absolutely dominates Twitter after every single one of
[03:26:03.380 --> 03:26:04.380]  these incidents.
[03:26:04.380 --> 03:26:09.780]  It says, quote, I'd just like to apologize to all peaceful Muslims on behalf of white
[03:26:09.780 --> 03:26:10.780]  people.
[03:26:10.780 --> 03:26:15.220]  Paul Joseph Watson and Katie Hopkins don't represent all of us.
[03:26:15.220 --> 03:26:20.300]  So again, putting it into the context of race, Islam is not a race.
[03:26:20.300 --> 03:26:22.180]  I have to keep saying that over and over again.
[03:26:22.180 --> 03:26:25.900]  There are actually white Muslims, there are black Muslims, there are brown Muslims.
[03:26:25.900 --> 03:26:28.820]  That's because it's a frigging belief system.
[03:26:28.820 --> 03:26:30.580]  It's not a race.
[03:26:30.580 --> 03:26:33.620]  So again, they put it in the context of why are you blaming all Muslims?
[03:26:33.620 --> 03:26:37.340]  Show me one instance where I blamed all Muslims for anything.
[03:26:37.340 --> 03:26:41.740]  You can't because it's a dishonest tactic to shut down a debate.
[03:26:41.740 --> 03:26:43.220]  It's not a real argument.
[03:26:43.220 --> 03:26:45.640]  It's never been part of the debate.
[03:26:45.640 --> 03:26:50.420]  What should be part of the debate is the fact that massive numbers of Muslims throughout
[03:26:50.420 --> 03:26:56.520]  the West, you know, 42% of young Muslims in France support suicide bombing under
[03:26:56.520 --> 03:26:58.700]  certain circumstances.
[03:26:58.700 --> 03:26:59.700]  That's a problem.
[03:26:59.700 --> 03:27:04.060]  We have to face up to it to try and stop these massacres from happening over and over
[03:27:04.060 --> 03:27:08.440]  again because as you see with this individual, the guy, the suicide bomber behind the
[03:27:08.440 --> 03:27:12.700]  Manchester Arena attack, born in Manchester.
[03:27:12.700 --> 03:27:15.620]  This is one of the integrated ones.
[03:27:15.620 --> 03:27:19.440]  His parents were Libyan refugees who came to the UK.
[03:27:19.440 --> 03:27:21.200]  The UK gave them refuge.
[03:27:21.200 --> 03:27:23.380]  They gave us a suicide bomber.
[03:27:23.380 --> 03:27:24.660]  Gee thanks.
[03:27:24.660 --> 03:27:29.660]  What is happening in these communities, what is happening in these prisons, in these mosques
[03:27:29.660 --> 03:27:34.500]  where people are radicalized to such a degree that they will maim and mutilate teenage
[03:27:34.500 --> 03:27:35.740]  girls.
[03:27:35.740 --> 03:27:39.020]  That should be the main frigging focus.
[03:27:39.020 --> 03:27:43.700]  Stop Katie Hopkins' offensive tweets.
[03:27:43.700 --> 03:27:46.460]  I mean I've laid out this scenario before I lay it out again.
[03:27:46.460 --> 03:27:49.540]  Let's see how much time we got left here and we're going to get into morning.
[03:27:49.540 --> 03:27:53.500]  He's going to get into the Libyan migrant crisis, going to get into Seth rich after
[03:27:53.500 --> 03:27:54.500]  the break.
[03:27:54.500 --> 03:27:57.220]  But again, here's the scenario.
[03:27:57.220 --> 03:28:01.740]  Say five Delta Airlines planes crashed in a single day.
[03:28:01.740 --> 03:28:04.780]  In one day, five Delta Airlines planes crash.
[03:28:04.780 --> 03:28:06.340]  What would the normal reaction be?
[03:28:06.340 --> 03:28:10.980]  Well, it would be to say, damn, there's something wrong with Delta planes.
[03:28:10.980 --> 03:28:12.620]  We need to investigate this.
[03:28:12.620 --> 03:28:14.140]  We need to get to the bottom of it.
[03:28:14.140 --> 03:28:18.560]  We need to do something about it because this cannot keep happening.
[03:28:18.560 --> 03:28:19.680]  People are dying.
[03:28:19.680 --> 03:28:24.300]  That would be the normal reaction to five Delta Airlines planes crashing in a single
[03:28:24.300 --> 03:28:25.300]  day.
[03:28:25.300 --> 03:28:26.940]  What would be the insane reaction?
[03:28:26.940 --> 03:28:32.720]  Well, it would be to tweet, hashtag not all Delta and say that thousands of Delta
[03:28:32.720 --> 03:28:35.500]  Airlines planes didn't crash today.
[03:28:35.500 --> 03:28:40.740]  So why are you blaming all of Delta Airlines, you Delta-phobe?
[03:28:40.740 --> 03:28:42.740]  That would be the insane reaction.
[03:28:42.740 --> 03:28:47.920]  The insane reaction would be to say, well, only five Delta Airlines planes crashed.
[03:28:47.920 --> 03:28:49.500]  Thousands of them didn't crash.
[03:28:49.500 --> 03:28:51.780]  It's just a few bad planes.
[03:28:51.780 --> 03:28:57.540]  Maybe we should just be tolerant of Delta Airlines planes crashing and continue life as
[03:28:57.540 --> 03:28:58.540]  normal.
[03:28:58.540 --> 03:28:59.540]  Okay.
[03:28:59.540 --> 03:29:01.500]  That would be the insane reaction.
[03:29:01.500 --> 03:29:06.820]  Nobody would have that reaction, but that's exactly the reaction the left has when it
[03:29:06.820 --> 03:29:08.020]  comes to terrorism.
[03:29:08.020 --> 03:29:13.740]  And it's, again, because they've embodied many of the same goals as Islamic terrorists
[03:29:13.740 --> 03:29:16.300]  in terms of hating the West.
[03:29:16.300 --> 03:29:20.900]  I mean, Europe has now completely lost faith in its culture.
[03:29:20.900 --> 03:29:26.820]  The political class is flooding the continent with these people who have extreme regressive
[03:29:26.820 --> 03:29:27.820]  beliefs.
[03:29:27.820 --> 03:29:29.420]  Look what's happening.
[03:29:29.420 --> 03:29:31.980]  And it's not just an existential threat with the terrorism.
[03:29:31.980 --> 03:29:35.960]  It's the day to day grind, the harassment, the abuse, the rape gangs.
[03:29:35.960 --> 03:29:38.480]  This is what Europe is currently going through.
[03:29:38.480 --> 03:29:43.760]  And it's because of what Angela Merkel, because of what Macron stands for, because
[03:29:43.760 --> 03:29:46.100]  of what the political elite stands for.
[03:29:46.100 --> 03:29:48.540]  We cannot allow it to go on.
[03:29:48.540 --> 03:29:49.540]  We'll be back after the break.
[03:29:49.540 --> 03:29:50.980]  It's the Alex Jones show live.
[03:29:50.980 --> 03:29:51.980]  Don't go away.
[03:29:51.980 --> 03:30:01.420]  Empires on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[03:30:01.420 --> 03:30:06.020]  The Constitutional Convention 1787 was held in strict secrecy, and at the end of the
[03:30:06.020 --> 03:30:09.580]  proceedings, citizens gathered outside Independence Hall to learn what had been produced behind
[03:30:09.580 --> 03:30:10.580]  closed doors.
[03:30:10.580 --> 03:30:14.180]  While Benjamin Franklin was leaving the hall, a lady asked him, well, doctor, what have
[03:30:14.180 --> 03:30:15.180]  we got?
[03:30:15.180 --> 03:30:16.440]  A republic or a monarchy?
[03:30:16.440 --> 03:30:19.420]  To which he responded, a republic, if you can keep it.
[03:30:19.420 --> 03:30:23.300]  But today, not only have we lost a republic, but most people don't even know what a republic
[03:30:23.300 --> 03:30:24.300]  even is.
[03:30:24.300 --> 03:30:26.660]  For one thing, a republic is not a democracy.
[03:30:26.660 --> 03:30:30.160]  A republic operates under the rule of law, which protects individual liberties so that
[03:30:30.160 --> 03:30:32.900]  the majority cannot take away the rights of the minority.
[03:30:32.900 --> 03:30:36.340]  Under a republic, the government and its citizens all abide by the same laws, regardless
[03:30:36.340 --> 03:30:38.180]  of political power or lack thereof.
[03:30:38.180 --> 03:30:41.920]  A democracy, on the other hand, only leads to mob rule fueled by the unrestrained whims
[03:30:41.920 --> 03:30:42.920]  of the public.
[03:30:42.920 --> 03:30:46.660]  In a democracy, the individual or any groups of individuals composing the minority have
[03:30:46.660 --> 03:30:49.100]  no protection against the unlimited power of the majority.
[03:30:49.100 --> 03:30:51.340]  It is a case of majority over man.
[03:30:51.340 --> 03:30:54.860]  In other words, under democracy, two wolves can vote to eat the sheep from dinner.
[03:30:54.860 --> 03:30:58.420]  Under a republic, the sheep's right to life is protected by the rule of law.
[03:30:58.420 --> 03:31:00.420]  This is Kit Daniels with Infowars.com.
[03:31:00.420 --> 03:31:05.420]  Let's go to Dabbitt in Florida.
[03:31:05.420 --> 03:31:07.420]  Dabbitt in Florida, you're on the air.
[03:31:07.420 --> 03:31:08.420]  Great.
[03:31:08.420 --> 03:31:09.420]  Hey, thank you so much.
[03:31:09.420 --> 03:31:13.420]  Listen, I have bought your product and I got to say they're amazing.
[03:31:13.420 --> 03:31:14.420]  Thank you.
[03:31:14.420 --> 03:31:19.260]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it because I've got caveman, superman vitality, secret
[03:31:19.260 --> 03:31:21.500]  flow, vitamin mineral fusion.
[03:31:21.500 --> 03:31:22.900]  I've got the body armor.
[03:31:22.900 --> 03:31:23.900]  Wow.
[03:31:23.900 --> 03:31:24.900]  Thank you.
[03:31:24.900 --> 03:31:25.900]  Wow.
[03:31:25.900 --> 03:31:26.900]  You're the type of lesser that makes it all possible.
[03:31:26.900 --> 03:31:27.900]  Which nutraceutical does you like best?
[03:31:27.900 --> 03:31:31.700]  I really like the vitamin mineral fusion, to be honest.
[03:31:31.700 --> 03:31:32.700]  That's amazing.
[03:31:32.700 --> 03:31:33.700]  That's really incredible.
[03:31:33.700 --> 03:31:36.100]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[03:31:36.100 --> 03:31:37.100]  I haven't felt sweet.
[03:31:37.100 --> 03:31:38.100]  My morning was fantastic.
[03:31:38.100 --> 03:31:39.100]  And I love you guys.
[03:31:39.100 --> 03:31:40.100]  I love the Infowars crew.
[03:31:40.100 --> 03:31:46.620]  And I just want to, yeah, I want to, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out
[03:31:46.620 --> 03:31:47.620]  there who's on the fence.
[03:31:47.620 --> 03:31:48.620]  Just buy it.
[03:31:48.620 --> 03:31:49.620]  You will love it.
[03:31:49.620 --> 03:31:52.380]  I'm telling you, I've never bought a bad product.
[03:31:52.380 --> 03:31:56.780]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfowarsLife.com.
[03:31:56.780 --> 03:32:01.740]  It's a win-win InfowarsLife.com.
[03:32:01.740 --> 03:32:03.460]  Today we call it bone broth.
[03:32:03.460 --> 03:32:07.700]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost
[03:32:07.700 --> 03:32:10.020]  to our modern diets of processed junk.
[03:32:10.020 --> 03:32:15.260]  We are now introducing Caveman by InfowarsLife.com, the ultimate and true paleo nutrition with
[03:32:15.260 --> 03:32:21.460]  bone broth, turmeric root, Chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single
[03:32:21.460 --> 03:32:22.980]  great tasting formula.
[03:32:22.980 --> 03:32:23.980]  Caveman.
[03:32:23.980 --> 03:32:27.780]  It's those people living in the wilds, having to actually build civilization that are our
[03:32:27.780 --> 03:32:28.780]  superior ancestors.
[03:32:28.780 --> 03:32:31.460]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[03:32:31.460 --> 03:32:34.460]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[03:32:34.460 --> 03:32:39.500]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength
[03:32:39.500 --> 03:32:43.940]  from the outside structure, full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces
[03:32:43.940 --> 03:32:45.060]  the blood for the body.
[03:32:45.060 --> 03:32:47.620]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[03:32:47.620 --> 03:32:51.700]  I'm a long way from the Caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get
[03:32:51.700 --> 03:32:54.260]  back to that essence that made us what we were.
[03:32:54.260 --> 03:32:55.580]  And this is a big part of it.
[03:32:55.580 --> 03:32:58.900]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself
[03:32:58.900 --> 03:33:00.340]  at InfowarsLife.com today.
[03:33:09.500 --> 03:33:31.460]  We're back live on the Alex Jones show.
[03:33:31.460 --> 03:33:33.860]  This is an article out of Breitbart.
[03:33:33.860 --> 03:33:39.140]  2017 has seen a terror attack attempted in Europe every nine days.
[03:33:39.140 --> 03:33:42.860]  We talked about for years how Europe would end up like Israel.
[03:33:42.860 --> 03:33:45.780]  It's now slowly beginning to seem like it.
[03:33:45.780 --> 03:33:48.540]  In fact, it seems like it's worse right now.
[03:33:48.540 --> 03:33:52.300]  Europe, the United Kingdom, Russia have witnessed terror attacks or attempted attacks
[03:33:52.300 --> 03:33:54.860]  every nine days in 2017.
[03:33:54.860 --> 03:34:01.540]  On average analysis of security incidents has revealed since January around 45 people have
[03:34:01.540 --> 03:34:04.980]  been killed by mostly Islamic terrorists while hundreds have been injured.
[03:34:04.980 --> 03:34:10.700]  The only known incident not linked to jihadism was the attack on the Borussia Dortmund soccer
[03:34:10.700 --> 03:34:11.980]  team.
[03:34:11.980 --> 03:34:15.700]  Attacks and attempted attacks have taken place in Austria, France, the United Kingdom,
[03:34:15.700 --> 03:34:19.660]  Belgium, Italy, Russia, Sweden, Norway, and Germany.
[03:34:19.660 --> 03:34:26.620]  Just in 2017 alone, security services in Britain, which has a population of 65 million,
[03:34:26.620 --> 03:34:32.340]  are known to be tracking 3,500 potential terror suspects or persons posing a threat.
[03:34:32.620 --> 03:34:37.500]  And again, in most cases, even though they're likely to become terrorists, they have to
[03:34:37.500 --> 03:34:40.380]  leave them alone, thousands of them.
[03:34:40.380 --> 03:34:45.860]  Thousands more flocking back in as a result of these ISIS-controlled areas collapsing.
[03:34:45.860 --> 03:34:47.340]  They're coming back to Europe.
[03:34:47.340 --> 03:34:49.940]  They're being allowed back into the country.
[03:34:49.940 --> 03:34:51.780]  Refugees welcome.
[03:34:51.780 --> 03:34:54.820]  The red carpet is rolled out.
[03:34:54.820 --> 03:34:59.860]  Now let's move on to the refugee crisis, of course, because it emerged that the parents
[03:34:59.860 --> 03:35:06.460]  of this suicide bomber escaped from the Gaddafi regime to come to the UK.
[03:35:06.460 --> 03:35:10.900]  Let's take a look at what's happening in Libya and why the true scale of it is being
[03:35:10.900 --> 03:35:12.900]  hidden from the public.
[03:35:12.900 --> 03:35:19.420]  Now this is important because, as we know, Gaddafi warned before he was toppled that
[03:35:19.420 --> 03:35:24.980]  jihadists would flock across the Mediterranean, would infiltrate European countries, would
[03:35:24.980 --> 03:35:27.180]  carry out terrorist attacks.
[03:35:27.180 --> 03:35:29.900]  That's exactly what is happening.
[03:35:29.900 --> 03:35:31.620]  Why is it happening?
[03:35:31.620 --> 03:35:35.940]  Because of these NGOs, because of these EU boats, these vessels that are literally
[03:35:35.940 --> 03:35:40.420]  giving migrants a taxi service straight to Europe.
[03:35:40.420 --> 03:35:46.220]  This is the biggest risk conception surrounding the migrant crisis, that these quote refugees
[03:35:46.220 --> 03:35:52.340]  are struggling to get close to Europe and that NGO boats are rescuing them.
[03:35:52.340 --> 03:35:54.740]  They're not rescuing them.
[03:35:54.740 --> 03:35:56.020]  This is how it works.
[03:35:56.020 --> 03:36:03.980]  The migrants pay people smugglers in Libya up to 1500 euros each, which is a year's
[03:36:03.980 --> 03:36:05.140]  wages.
[03:36:05.140 --> 03:36:09.660]  So they're not destitute refugees, 80% of them in the case of the ones going to
[03:36:09.660 --> 03:36:14.260]  Italy or 85% indeed are men.
[03:36:14.260 --> 03:36:18.140]  They're not, forget Syria, they're not even from Libya.
[03:36:18.140 --> 03:36:22.940]  They're from other African countries, Eritrea, Nigeria.
[03:36:22.940 --> 03:36:29.740]  They're not refugees, they're economic migrants, they're paying people smugglers.
[03:36:29.740 --> 03:36:35.580]  The people smugglers transport them to a position just 12 miles off the coast of Libya, just
[03:36:35.580 --> 03:36:37.740]  12 miles.
[03:36:37.740 --> 03:36:43.980]  Then they send out a distress signal and these NGO vessels get the call, they come
[03:36:43.980 --> 03:36:46.820]  straight to them, they pick them up.
[03:36:46.820 --> 03:36:51.140]  Again, we presented the evidence and it's going to be in a big video that I've got coming
[03:36:51.140 --> 03:36:52.620]  out in a couple of days.
[03:36:52.620 --> 03:36:57.940]  The people smugglers are in direct contact with the aid agencies.
[03:36:57.940 --> 03:37:02.260]  Even though it's completely illegal, they're in direct phone contact with them, which
[03:37:02.260 --> 03:37:08.220]  is why they're often first on the scene to rescue these migrants, which is a criminal
[03:37:08.220 --> 03:37:09.440]  offense.
[03:37:09.440 --> 03:37:15.860]  To be coordinating with criminal people smugglers, that's something that they should be prosecuted
[03:37:15.860 --> 03:37:16.860]  for.
[03:37:16.860 --> 03:37:22.820]  They should be prosecuted if this investigation in Italy draws to its correct conclusion because
[03:37:22.820 --> 03:37:26.440]  that's the way it's heading at the moment, thankfully.
[03:37:26.440 --> 03:37:28.780]  So we've played the videos before.
[03:37:28.780 --> 03:37:34.820]  You can go to MarineTraffic.com and see how these boats come from Sicily.
[03:37:34.820 --> 03:37:39.460]  They leave Sicily, they go to 12 miles off the coast of Libya, they pick up their
[03:37:39.460 --> 03:37:42.680]  human cargo, take it back to Italy.
[03:37:42.680 --> 03:37:45.620]  It's literally a taxi service.
[03:37:45.620 --> 03:37:53.600]  When these migrants get back to Italy, having been picked up, half of them immediately disappear.
[03:37:53.600 --> 03:37:54.600]  Half of them.
[03:37:54.600 --> 03:37:59.120]  Now, you've seen the stats when it comes to certain people from Islamic countries
[03:37:59.120 --> 03:38:04.960]  supporting ISIS, huge numbers, uncomfortably huge numbers, half of those people are just
[03:38:04.960 --> 03:38:05.960]  disappearing.
[03:38:05.960 --> 03:38:07.940]  We've seen the reports.
[03:38:07.940 --> 03:38:13.860]  Migrants arriving in Italy, eyewitness testimony, they have ISIS flags beheading videos on
[03:38:13.860 --> 03:38:16.060]  their phone, okay?
[03:38:16.060 --> 03:38:18.100]  Some of these people are jihadists.
[03:38:18.100 --> 03:38:23.600]  Some of them have been paid by ISIS to become ISIS members, to become ISIS sleeper cells
[03:38:23.600 --> 03:38:24.600]  in Europe.
[03:38:24.600 --> 03:38:30.080]  That's how many of them pay the 1500 euro fee to the people smugglers in the first
[03:38:30.080 --> 03:38:31.080]  place.
[03:38:31.080 --> 03:38:38.420]  And isn't it ironic that the only time these boats are diverted from Sicily, having
[03:38:38.420 --> 03:38:43.580]  picked up migrants from Libya, is when the G7 elitists are in town.
[03:38:43.580 --> 03:38:45.460]  We had that story last week.
[03:38:45.460 --> 03:38:51.240]  So the only time they don't head back to Italy is when the very political class that
[03:38:51.240 --> 03:38:55.500]  created this disaster is in town.
[03:38:55.500 --> 03:39:01.420]  They don't want to be faced up with the consequences of the policies they created.
[03:39:01.420 --> 03:39:05.020]  Because again, it's a security threat, security threat for them.
[03:39:05.020 --> 03:39:06.980]  Forget about the Italian people.
[03:39:06.980 --> 03:39:12.860]  There's literally a war on the streets of Italy in places like Palermo in Sicily between
[03:39:12.860 --> 03:39:17.900]  mafias, between Italian mafias and these African migrant gangs.
[03:39:17.900 --> 03:39:20.620]  They're literally shooting each other, killing each other.
[03:39:20.620 --> 03:39:24.900]  The mayor of Palermo, in fact, I can find his comment here.
[03:39:24.900 --> 03:39:33.120]  He actually said that Palermo was now a Middle Eastern Islamic town and he was happy
[03:39:33.120 --> 03:39:34.120]  with that.
[03:39:34.120 --> 03:39:36.500]  So a lot of them just love it.
[03:39:36.500 --> 03:39:41.300]  A lot of them just love being a turf war between migrant criminal gangs and the Italian
[03:39:41.300 --> 03:39:42.500]  mafia.
[03:39:42.500 --> 03:39:43.500]  That's what they want.
[03:39:43.500 --> 03:39:46.260]  That's what they're getting in places like Palermo.
[03:39:46.260 --> 03:39:51.400]  But again, the problem goes back to these NGO ships.
[03:39:51.400 --> 03:39:54.280]  Many of them are German, no surprise there.
[03:39:54.280 --> 03:40:00.740]  Even the EU border agency Frontex has accused aid agencies of helping criminals achieve
[03:40:00.740 --> 03:40:02.340]  their objectives.
[03:40:02.340 --> 03:40:05.060]  That's a direct quote.
[03:40:05.060 --> 03:40:09.940]  The people smugglers contacted the NGO boats because they know they won't be arrested
[03:40:09.940 --> 03:40:14.260]  if they contacted coast guard boats, they've got a risk of being arrested so they don't
[03:40:14.260 --> 03:40:16.260]  do that.
[03:40:16.260 --> 03:40:17.260]  Here's a quote.
[03:40:17.260 --> 03:40:23.060]  Since June 2016, many boats have been rescued near the Libyan coast by aid agency vessels
[03:40:23.060 --> 03:40:30.340]  without any prior distress call, suggesting the rendezvous has been prearranged.
[03:40:30.340 --> 03:40:35.020]  So again, they're in direct contact with the criminal people smugglers.
[03:40:35.020 --> 03:40:41.340]  Italian prosecutor Carmelo Zaccara says he has evidence of phone calls between criminal
[03:40:41.340 --> 03:40:51.380]  people smugglers and NGOs like Save the Children, Proactiva Open Arms, and SOS Mediterranean.
[03:40:51.380 --> 03:40:56.220]  Also Avaz.org, Medicine San Frontier, and MoveOn.org are all involved.
[03:40:56.220 --> 03:41:04.660]  You'll notice those are all George Soros bankrolled organizations, 500 million he invested not
[03:41:04.700 --> 03:41:12.220]  long ago to quote help refugees, and undoubtedly much of it is going to these NGOs to chart
[03:41:12.220 --> 03:41:20.619]  these vessels that go out, bring these unvetted, in some cases ISIS members or ISIS sympathizers
[03:41:20.619 --> 03:41:22.900]  into Europe.
[03:41:22.900 --> 03:41:25.260]  So again, it's an absolutely huge scandal.
[03:41:25.260 --> 03:41:27.140]  Nobody knows the scale of it.
[03:41:27.140 --> 03:41:34.260]  We're talking 200,000 migrants have arrived in Italy last year alone, and that's increasing
[03:41:34.500 --> 03:41:43.060]  200,000 a year, unvetted, just brought straight in, half of them immediately disappear.
[03:41:43.060 --> 03:41:48.460]  Just 2.65% of migrants arriving in Italy are awarded asylum status.
[03:41:48.460 --> 03:41:54.740]  So again, the huge misconception that they're all refugees, they're not refugees, the vast
[03:41:54.740 --> 03:42:01.060]  majority of them are men and half of them at least just immediately disappear as soon
[03:42:01.140 --> 03:42:02.860]  as they arrive in Europe.
[03:42:02.860 --> 03:42:08.100]  Now people say, well, is the migrant crisis going to end, or is there just going to be
[03:42:08.100 --> 03:42:13.619]  just so many people coming in that it stops being a deluge and just becomes a trickle?
[03:42:13.619 --> 03:42:17.180]  Well, no, because Africa's population is exploding.
[03:42:17.180 --> 03:42:18.780]  Again, where are these people coming from?
[03:42:18.780 --> 03:42:22.660]  They're not Libyans, okay, they're coming from Niger, they're coming from Chad, they're
[03:42:22.660 --> 03:42:26.340]  coming from Sudan, they're coming from Ethiopia.
[03:42:26.340 --> 03:42:30.660]  You look at the projected populations of those countries in Africa.
[03:42:30.660 --> 03:42:34.020]  Niger's population is exploding.
[03:42:34.020 --> 03:42:38.940]  These are the countries surrounding Libya, Niger's population is set to quadruple in
[03:42:38.940 --> 03:42:44.780]  the next three decades, 20 million to 72 million, Chad's population is going to leap
[03:42:44.780 --> 03:42:52.660]  from 14 million to 35 million, Sudan is heading towards 80 million, Egypt 152 million,
[03:42:52.660 --> 03:43:00.180]  Ethiopia 189 million, and Nigeria 400 million.
[03:43:00.180 --> 03:43:02.220]  So it's never going to stop.
[03:43:02.220 --> 03:43:08.420]  If we have this policy of just picking them up, bringing them in on taxis, it's never
[03:43:08.420 --> 03:43:11.460]  going to stop, and this is the problem.
[03:43:11.460 --> 03:43:16.380]  You can't flood European cities with tens of millions of people from the Middle East
[03:43:16.380 --> 03:43:19.580]  and Africa and expect it to remain the same.
[03:43:19.580 --> 03:43:24.060]  Eventually, it's going to start to feel less like Europe and more like the Middle
[03:43:24.060 --> 03:43:26.740]  East and Africa, okay?
[03:43:26.740 --> 03:43:31.140]  If you took hundreds of millions of white people and dumped them into China, that's
[03:43:31.140 --> 03:43:33.340]  going to change their society.
[03:43:33.340 --> 03:43:38.140]  It's just basic demographics, basic culture.
[03:43:38.140 --> 03:43:42.260]  So again, southern Italy is going through absolute nightmares of having turf wars between
[03:43:42.260 --> 03:43:46.940]  the Italian mafia and these African crime gangs that have arrived.
[03:43:46.940 --> 03:43:51.000]  This is the quote from the mayor of Palermo that I alluded to earlier.
[03:43:51.000 --> 03:43:54.060]  He said, quote, Palermo is no longer an Italian town.
[03:43:54.060 --> 03:43:55.820]  It's no longer European.
[03:43:55.820 --> 03:43:59.980]  You can walk in the city and feel like you're in Istanbul or Beirut.
[03:43:59.980 --> 03:44:04.460]  Palermo is a Middle Eastern town in Europe.
[03:44:04.460 --> 03:44:06.740]  That's the mayor of Palermo.
[03:44:06.740 --> 03:44:08.119]  He's happy about it.
[03:44:08.119 --> 03:44:13.180]  He said it was a good thing, similar to how the Green Party member in Germany said
[03:44:13.180 --> 03:44:19.460]  that major German cities being a white minority in 20 years would be a great thing.
[03:44:19.460 --> 03:44:20.580]  They celebrated it.
[03:44:20.580 --> 03:44:23.260]  This is what they're all about.
[03:44:23.260 --> 03:44:28.060]  Because again, they ship in a class of people that are totally dependent on handouts.
[03:44:28.060 --> 03:44:29.540]  That keeps them in power.
[03:44:29.540 --> 03:44:31.320]  That's all they care about.
[03:44:31.320 --> 03:44:33.260]  They want to be in power forever.
[03:44:33.260 --> 03:44:37.720]  This is how they think they're going to do it, by destroying their own culture, by
[03:44:37.720 --> 03:44:41.340]  committing suicide.
[03:44:41.340 --> 03:44:43.340]  Absolutely incredible.
[03:44:43.340 --> 03:44:45.660]  And it's not just the terror attacks.
[03:44:45.660 --> 03:44:48.980]  People make the argument, well, you know, how many people die of cancer?
[03:44:48.980 --> 03:44:51.260]  How many people die in road accidents?
[03:44:51.260 --> 03:44:54.500]  It's not just the existential threat.
[03:44:54.500 --> 03:44:59.140]  There was a report out of Sweden the other day, which we covered, 90% of shootings
[03:44:59.140 --> 03:45:06.940]  in Sweden using firearms are carried out by migrants, 90%, not 19, 90.
[03:45:06.940 --> 03:45:08.660]  You can look at Germany.
[03:45:08.660 --> 03:45:16.260]  Their own government interior ministry report found that there were an extra 402,000 crimes
[03:45:16.260 --> 03:45:24.180]  committed by migrants per year, with non-Germans accounting for 27.6% of total offenses.
[03:45:24.180 --> 03:45:28.300]  So they're completely overrepresented in the crime statistics.
[03:45:28.300 --> 03:45:31.200]  You talk about that in Sweden, they put you on a hate list.
[03:45:31.200 --> 03:45:34.340]  You see how this begins to work.
[03:45:34.340 --> 03:45:37.060]  Half a million migrants in Germany are on welfare benefits.
[03:45:37.060 --> 03:45:42.660]  The idea that we need them to save our economy, to import workers because we're committing
[03:45:42.660 --> 03:45:46.760]  demographic suicide, doesn't stand up.
[03:45:46.760 --> 03:45:49.180]  Most of them are on benefits, they don't have jobs.
[03:45:49.180 --> 03:45:53.180]  They bleed the economy, they don't add to the economy.
[03:45:53.180 --> 03:45:56.700]  We have the gang rapes, we have the harassment, we have the abuse of women.
[03:45:56.700 --> 03:46:04.420]  You now have women in Paris protesting Eastern Paris because they can't leave the house
[03:46:04.420 --> 03:46:10.540]  dressed in certain clothing without being abused and harassed by gangs of migrant men.
[03:46:10.540 --> 03:46:12.780]  We've seen the rapes, we've seen the gang rapes.
[03:46:12.780 --> 03:46:17.100]  We had a gang rape in Austria reported just a few days ago.
[03:46:17.100 --> 03:46:24.220]  Weekly, at least biweekly, we have a gang rape in some small, quaint European town
[03:46:24.220 --> 03:46:29.060]  because of this culture that we've imported.
[03:46:29.060 --> 03:46:34.380]  In Germany and Italy, they're confiscating private property to house these migrants.
[03:46:34.380 --> 03:46:39.020]  In Sweden, the big postal company, Post Nord, announced it would stop mail delivery to the
[03:46:39.020 --> 03:46:43.500]  migrant suburb of Rinkaby because it's too unsafe.
[03:46:43.500 --> 03:46:44.500]  Social media.
[03:46:44.500 --> 03:46:48.780]  Again, if you complain about this though, you're bad.
[03:46:48.780 --> 03:46:52.260]  Don't fix the problem, complain about the people who are complaining about it.
[03:46:52.260 --> 03:46:55.060]  Put them on a hate crime blacklist.
[03:46:55.060 --> 03:46:57.500]  That's what Angela Merkel's main concern was, wasn't it?
[03:46:57.500 --> 03:47:03.520]  When she talked to Zuckerberg, how can we stop people criticizing this policy?
[03:47:03.520 --> 03:47:09.240]  So again, these NGOs that are picking up, it's a virtual taxi service.
[03:47:09.240 --> 03:47:14.000]  They're picking them up from the coast of Libya, dumping them into Italy, half go missing.
[03:47:14.000 --> 03:47:16.040]  We need to put a stop to this.
[03:47:16.040 --> 03:47:18.520]  These NGOs need to be prosecuted.
[03:47:18.520 --> 03:47:24.940]  They are currently being investigated by Italian authorities and hopefully that prosecution
[03:47:24.940 --> 03:47:26.720]  will come through.
[03:47:26.720 --> 03:47:32.880]  The other positive development in actually stopping this is that Beppe Grillo's five star movement,
[03:47:32.880 --> 03:47:38.800]  which is a populist party in Italy, according to recent polls, is either tied or has a
[03:47:38.800 --> 03:47:42.920]  slender lead over the ruling center left party in Italy.
[03:47:42.920 --> 03:47:45.600]  And again, this is not just about Italy.
[03:47:45.600 --> 03:47:48.320]  This is where the migrants are coming in.
[03:47:48.320 --> 03:47:51.119]  This is the major route now.
[03:47:51.119 --> 03:47:56.119]  If we stop this, if we plug this leak, we can actually prevent terror attacks.
[03:47:56.119 --> 03:48:01.520]  ISIS has bragged about how they're exploiting this to infiltrate fighters into Europe.
[03:48:01.520 --> 03:48:05.760]  Stop Beppe Grillo's five star movement in Italy like nothing before, because they
[03:48:05.760 --> 03:48:10.560]  have a chance of being elected next year in the Italian election.
[03:48:10.560 --> 03:48:15.960]  They have promised to stop these NGO boats, picking up these migrants, dumping them
[03:48:15.960 --> 03:48:17.560]  into Italy.
[03:48:17.560 --> 03:48:21.440]  That's one of their campaigns, Beppe Grillo's five star movement.
[03:48:21.440 --> 03:48:23.760]  Again, it's not a far right party.
[03:48:23.760 --> 03:48:25.360]  It's a populist party.
[03:48:25.360 --> 03:48:32.080]  It's doing extremely well in the polls and they have a chance of stopping this.
[03:48:32.080 --> 03:48:37.080]  Of stopping this nightmare that is being inflicted upon Europe, another expression
[03:48:37.080 --> 03:48:39.840]  of which we saw last night in Manchester.
[03:48:39.840 --> 03:48:41.520]  But again, it's not just about migrants.
[03:48:41.520 --> 03:48:42.940]  It's not just about refugees.
[03:48:42.940 --> 03:48:46.000]  It's about these ghettoized areas.
[03:48:46.000 --> 03:48:48.740]  People going to mosques, people going to prisons.
[03:48:48.740 --> 03:48:55.380]  The radicalization problem in prisons is absolutely endemic.
[03:48:55.380 --> 03:48:58.619]  But again, because of political correctness, there's nothing done about it.
[03:48:58.619 --> 03:49:01.880]  There's absolutely nothing done about it at every turn.
[03:49:01.880 --> 03:49:03.980]  These are the solutions that we need to focus on.
[03:49:03.980 --> 03:49:08.440]  I mentioned some of them in my video, which you heard earlier.
[03:49:08.440 --> 03:49:12.740]  So none of the debate is about all Muslims are responsible.
[03:49:12.740 --> 03:49:15.540]  The debate is this is terrible.
[03:49:15.540 --> 03:49:19.720]  We cannot let this become the new normal like the media wants us to do.
[03:49:19.720 --> 03:49:21.280]  We have to address this.
[03:49:21.280 --> 03:49:26.840]  We have to propose concrete solutions to prevent this from happening.
[03:49:26.840 --> 03:49:32.040]  Every nine days now in Europe, there's a terror attack.
[03:49:32.040 --> 03:49:38.300]  So the solution is not to shut down people who are actually proposing remedies.
[03:49:38.300 --> 03:49:39.900]  That's not the solution.
[03:49:39.900 --> 03:49:45.060]  But that's what this political class is pushing because again, they're beholden to this policy.
[03:49:45.060 --> 03:49:49.180]  They created it for their own political machinations.
[03:49:49.180 --> 03:49:51.020]  Now they're wedded to it.
[03:49:51.020 --> 03:49:58.580]  So they have to demonize anybody who tries to stop that policy as Islamophobic, as racist.
[03:49:58.580 --> 03:50:03.580]  But we should not allow this to continue as normal.
[03:50:03.580 --> 03:50:04.580]  Another report here.
[03:50:04.580 --> 03:50:09.300]  ISIS claims responsibility for Manchester attack suspect bomber identified again.
[03:50:09.300 --> 03:50:11.040]  His parents were Libyan refugees.
[03:50:11.040 --> 03:50:12.760]  The UK gave them sanctuary.
[03:50:12.760 --> 03:50:14.420]  They gave us a suicide bomber.
[03:50:14.420 --> 03:50:18.060]  She thinks what is happening in these communities.
[03:50:18.060 --> 03:50:22.900]  They've carried out controlled explosions in Wali range, an area of Manchester, which
[03:50:22.900 --> 03:50:28.140]  again has four mosques in one area alone.
[03:50:28.140 --> 03:50:29.740]  It's not that big an area.
[03:50:29.740 --> 03:50:30.740]  Four mosques.
[03:50:30.740 --> 03:50:32.300]  What's happening inside these mosques?
[03:50:32.300 --> 03:50:33.860]  Did he attend the mosques?
[03:50:33.860 --> 03:50:35.200]  Was he radicalized?
[03:50:35.200 --> 03:50:40.200]  We know that he was known to security services, and that's the case in almost every single
[03:50:40.200 --> 03:50:43.700]  case because they're told, oh, you can only track them.
[03:50:43.700 --> 03:50:45.860]  You can't actually apprehend them.
[03:50:45.860 --> 03:50:49.060]  Even though they're radicalized, they're terrorists.
[03:50:49.060 --> 03:50:51.060]  They're likely to commit terrorist attacks.
[03:50:51.060 --> 03:50:52.820]  This is a situation in Europe.
[03:50:52.820 --> 03:50:54.540]  It's absolutely horrific.
[03:50:54.540 --> 03:50:58.860]  Something must change beyond virtue signaling and hashtags.
[03:50:58.860 --> 03:51:00.580]  We'll be back on the show live.
[03:51:00.580 --> 03:51:01.580]  Don't go away.
[03:51:01.580 --> 03:51:04.300]  Elizabeth McCabe, AKA Lucky One of Truth Frequency News.
[03:51:04.300 --> 03:51:07.380]  I wanted to tell you all about Extendivite from heart drop dot com.
[03:51:07.380 --> 03:51:09.760]  Y'all know I check everything before I air it.
[03:51:09.760 --> 03:51:13.420]  When I heard about Extendivite on TFR, I went to heart drop dot com and started my
[03:51:13.420 --> 03:51:14.420]  research.
[03:51:14.420 --> 03:51:15.420]  It's got cayenne.
[03:51:15.420 --> 03:51:16.700]  That's good for blood and circulation.
[03:51:16.700 --> 03:51:18.220]  It stimulates the blood flow.
[03:51:18.220 --> 03:51:22.380]  It's got garlic, which fights bacteria like antibiotics, and it lowers the cholesterol
[03:51:22.380 --> 03:51:23.380]  and blood pressure.
[03:51:23.380 --> 03:51:26.140]  It also has milk thistle, which is the best detox for liver.
[03:51:26.140 --> 03:51:29.180]  I couldn't wait to try it out, and I'm glad I did four months ago.
[03:51:29.180 --> 03:51:30.660]  And here's obvious results.
[03:51:30.660 --> 03:51:32.320]  My hands and feet don't get cold anymore.
[03:51:32.320 --> 03:51:34.580]  The varicose veins have faded, too.
[03:51:34.580 --> 03:51:36.500]  My wrists don't hurt after typing all day.

[03:53:58.640 --> 03:53:58.660]  Effective.
[03:53:59.000 --> 03:54:24.440]  It's the final segment of the Alex Jones Show 4th Hour and I want to direct you to the specials
[03:54:24.440 --> 03:54:31.160]  at InfoWarsStore.com because again very few outlets will actually have the temerity to tell you the
[03:54:31.160 --> 03:54:38.600]  truth about the aftermath of situations like Manchester. You know the sheer hate and
[03:54:38.600 --> 03:54:43.560]  oppression that is inflicted upon us simply for telling the truth about this. There are powerful
[03:54:43.560 --> 03:54:48.840]  forces that don't want you to hear this information. We've been so effective in red
[03:54:48.840 --> 03:54:56.120]  pilling a generation. They're terrified of us and we couldn't do it without you. We need your support

[03:56:29.800 --> 03:56:33.160]  Now let's just finish off here. Moving on to Seth Rich news of course.
[03:56:34.200 --> 03:56:39.720]  Last week we had a private investigator come out and claim that from his sources he knew that
[03:56:39.720 --> 03:56:45.160]  Seth Rich was the source of the DNC leaks. That got poo-pooed. There was a pushback against that.
[03:56:45.720 --> 03:56:50.600]  Was he threatened? We don't know now. Kim.com who of course was the founder of Mega Upload
[03:56:50.600 --> 03:56:56.520]  teased this yesterday by coming out and saying that he knew for a fact that Seth Rich,
[03:56:56.520 --> 03:57:03.000]  not Russia, Seth Rich, the murdered DNC staffer was the source of the DNC leak.
[03:57:03.000 --> 03:57:08.920]  Now he's released a statement on his website saying quote, I know this because in late 2014
[03:57:08.920 --> 03:57:13.000]  a person contacted me about helping me to start a branch of the internet party in the
[03:57:13.000 --> 03:57:19.480]  in the United States. He called himself panda. I now know that panda was Seth Rich. Of course
[03:57:19.480 --> 03:57:24.520]  that's the icon, that's the avatar that he used on his different accounts. He continues
[03:57:24.520 --> 03:57:28.520]  panda advised me that he was working on voter analytics tools and other technologies that the
[03:57:28.520 --> 03:57:34.520]  internet party may find helpful. So he was disenfranchised because Bernie Sanders who he
[03:57:34.520 --> 03:57:40.440]  supported was screwed over. That was his motivation. He was in contact with Kim.com.
[03:57:41.000 --> 03:57:45.960]  Now Kim.com continues in this statement, I've consulted with my lawyers except my full
[03:57:45.960 --> 03:57:50.680]  statement should be provided to the authorities so he says he's prepared to do that. If my
[03:57:50.680 --> 03:57:55.560]  evidence is required to be given in the US I would be prepared to do so. If appropriate
[03:57:55.560 --> 03:57:59.880]  arrangements are made I would need a guarantee from special counsel Mueller on behalf of the
[03:57:59.880 --> 03:58:05.480]  United States safe passage given that his house has been raided before from New Zealand to the
[03:58:05.480 --> 03:58:10.680]  United States and back. So now he's saying he will give that evidence of Seth Rich being the
[03:58:10.680 --> 03:58:16.760]  source of the DNC leaks to a special prosecution. Will it come out or will they clamp
[03:58:16.760 --> 03:58:23.000]  down on it? They are absolutely terrified in DC the establishment swamp of this coming out.
[03:58:23.000 --> 03:58:29.480]  Will it finally come to light proving that Seth Rich was the source of the DNC leaks derailing
[03:58:29.640 --> 03:58:33.960]  the whole Trump Russian narrative. That's going to wrap it up for this segment of
[03:58:33.960 --> 03:58:38.360]  the Alex Jones show. Nightly news coming up. Breaking news at infowars.com.
[03:58:43.480 --> 03:58:50.360]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
