[00:00.000 --> 00:25.000]  From the Infowars.com News Center, deep behind enemy lines in occupied Texas, broadcasting
[00:25.000 --> 00:31.000]  worldwide, you're listening to the voice of human resistance against the technotronic
[00:31.000 --> 00:39.000]  technocracy tank goper. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:39.000 --> 00:47.000]  The suicide bomber has been identified in Handiwork, Salman Abadi, 23. Tens of thousands
[00:47.000 --> 00:52.000]  of jihadists have floored into Europe. Here's some of their Handiwork last night when the
[00:52.000 --> 00:59.000]  country that welcomed him with open arms was attacked.
[00:59.000 --> 01:26.000]  Oh my God, what's going on? What's going on? Oh my God!
[01:26.000 --> 01:39.000]  Oh my God! Oh my God!
[01:39.000 --> 01:42.000]  No.
[01:42.000 --> 01:47.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, there are five million people plus that have been brought into Europe
[01:47.000 --> 01:52.000]  in the last four years, 80% of our military age meant according to Interpol.
[01:52.000 --> 01:58.000]  The United Nations ran a public program to recruit jihadists from the Arab Spring, from
[01:58.000 --> 02:07.000]  Africa, the Middle East, from Eastern Europe, from places like Chechnya to come to Germany,
[02:07.000 --> 02:16.000]  France, Belgium, Sweden, the UK, Canada, the United States.
[02:16.000 --> 02:22.000]  They have pledged allegiance to ISIS and al-Qaeda. They have pledged allegiance to attack our
[02:22.000 --> 02:27.000]  countries. And then every time there's an attack which are intensifying all the time with
[02:27.000 --> 02:33.000]  the shootings, the truck attacks, the bombings, the media comes out and I've got articles
[02:33.000 --> 02:40.000]  on infowars.com and blames conservatism and says that Islamophobia is what is making these
[02:40.000 --> 02:46.000]  people attack us.
[02:46.000 --> 02:51.000]  That story is up on infowars.com where the left was very, very quick to come out and
[02:51.000 --> 02:57.000]  bemoan Islamophobia backlash on social media following Manchester terror attack.
[02:57.000 --> 03:03.000]  So not only is the left and these globalist systems we have to blame for bringing in these
[03:03.000 --> 03:10.000]  terrorists on top of it, they blame those of us that have warned of it and say it's our fault.
[03:10.000 --> 03:17.000]  And then a bunch of well-meaning teenagers, some of them children, you know why you let
[03:17.000 --> 03:22.000]  your kids go to a rock concert when they're eight years old, get attacked and I point
[03:22.000 --> 03:28.000]  out it's liberal, wide open UK and the liberal policies that are to blame for that in the
[03:28.000 --> 03:34.000]  re-aggregate on average more than half the barrettes are the liberal trendies that would
[03:34.000 --> 03:39.000]  walk off a plank, who would jump off of a cliff, who would slip their own rest, cut their
[03:39.000 --> 03:45.000]  own heads off, they were told it was trending and it's so sad to see mass Stockholm syndrome.
[03:45.000 --> 03:49.000]  I don't blame the victims.
[03:49.000 --> 03:54.000]  I blame the culture, the brainwashing, the globalist for turning people into cult members
[03:54.000 --> 03:59.000]  who will go along with religions and systems that are diametrically opposed to their own
[03:59.000 --> 04:05.000]  supposed beliefs.
[04:05.000 --> 04:09.000]  It's sick but that media matters, David Brock comes out, because what do you do?
[04:09.000 --> 04:14.000]  What do you do when you push this agenda of open borders and bring it in the Islamist
[04:14.000 --> 04:20.000]  and they keep raping people and they keep killing people and they're fit to bill for
[04:20.000 --> 04:25.000]  being the rapugees that we call them, what do you do?
[04:25.000 --> 04:31.000]  You turn it around and you say, oh no, it's the right wingers fault, Salish Jones' fault.
[04:31.000 --> 04:35.000]  He stirred up the Muslims or he blames the children that got blown up.
[04:35.000 --> 04:42.000]  No, I blame the parents and I blame the liberals and I blame anyone who called for open borders
[04:42.000 --> 04:43.000]  to bring these rattlesnakes in.
[04:43.000 --> 04:48.000]  If I bring a rattlesnake in and stick it under your bed and it bites you, it's my fault.
[04:48.000 --> 04:52.000]  But if you know I've stuck a rattlesnake in there and you go along with it as well,
[04:52.000 --> 04:54.000]  you become part of it.
[04:54.000 --> 04:57.000]  That's just common sense logic.
[04:57.000 --> 05:26.000]  They are the ones that are guilty that people like media matters.
[05:27.000 --> 05:31.000]  Also not forget how hard Trump hit Saudi Arabia on the campaign trail, ridiculing them for
[05:31.000 --> 05:36.000]  their treatment of women and homosexuals and criticizing Hillary Clinton for taking money
[05:36.000 --> 05:37.000]  from them.
[05:37.000 --> 05:41.000]  But President Trump did step on the floor of the Arab Islamic America summit in Riyadh
[05:41.000 --> 05:45.000]  and call out radical Islamic terrorism saying their lives would be brief.
[05:45.000 --> 05:49.000]  Also worth consideration is the stock market jolt the arms deal gave Wall Street, especially
[05:49.000 --> 05:51.000]  Lockheed Martin and Raytheon.
[05:51.000 --> 05:55.000]  Meanwhile, back in America, the Democrats are trying to impeach Trump, crying foreign
[05:55.000 --> 05:58.000]  collusion, but are silent on this arms deal.
[05:58.000 --> 05:59.000]  They must be shareholders.
[05:59.000 --> 06:01.000]  For Infowars.com, this is Owen Troy.
[06:01.000 --> 06:05.000]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[06:05.000 --> 06:10.000]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[06:10.000 --> 06:12.000]  to detoxify the body.
[06:12.000 --> 06:17.000]  That's why I'm introducing Z Shield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[06:17.000 --> 06:18.000]  It's made in the USA.
[06:18.000 --> 06:23.000]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying
[06:23.000 --> 06:25.000]  the body and it supports the Info War.
[06:25.000 --> 06:27.000]  It is a classical 360 win.
[06:27.000 --> 06:31.000]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year.
[06:31.000 --> 06:36.000]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as
[06:36.000 --> 06:37.000]  you can possibly get.
[06:37.000 --> 06:41.000]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this
[06:41.000 --> 06:46.000]  country in the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you
[06:46.000 --> 06:51.000]  can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the
[06:51.000 --> 06:54.000]  next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[06:54.000 --> 06:57.000]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[06:57.000 --> 07:26.000]  Now it's time to change our bodies.
[07:26.000 --> 07:29.000]  We have let us basically keep their well-known packaging.
[07:29.000 --> 07:33.000]  It is an answer to prayer and because we're cutting out the middleman, 20% off retail,
[07:33.000 --> 07:36.000]  sign up for auto-ship, an additional 25% off.
[07:36.000 --> 07:41.000]  It's all there, the body wash, the shampoo, the deodorant, the mouthwash.
[07:41.000 --> 07:43.000]  All of it is truly game-changing.
[07:43.000 --> 07:47.000]  It is the exact same product, just the name is different, EmRick's Essentials, and it's
[07:47.000 --> 07:53.000]  on average 20% off what it would be in stores buying it directly from infowarstore.com.
[07:53.000 --> 07:56.000]  Help us win the info war while getting products everybody needs.
[07:56.000 --> 08:01.000]  infowarslive.com where you'll find the entire line of EmRick's Essentials.
[08:01.000 --> 08:14.000]  Well, the leftists are blaming the right wing.
[08:14.000 --> 08:19.000]  Now it's Jones' show because there is a war on your mind.
[08:19.000 --> 08:24.000]  That's the headline with the tweets from the news article headlines at infowars.com.
[08:24.000 --> 08:32.000]  Leftist, Pomon, Islamophobia, backlash on social media following Manchester terrorist attack
[08:32.000 --> 08:36.000]  and basically blame Christians for stirring up the Muslims.
[08:36.000 --> 08:38.000]  We need to submit to their religion.
[08:38.000 --> 08:40.000]  We need to put our women in a jubbs.
[08:40.000 --> 08:45.000]  We need to have the feminist groups go out and scream Allah Akbar in the town squares
[08:45.000 --> 08:47.000]  all over the United States and all over Europe.
[08:47.000 --> 08:51.000]  And that will make the Islamists stop attacking us.
[08:51.000 --> 08:59.000]  All over the news they're asking who is the accomplice to the reported bomber that CBS News
[08:59.000 --> 09:03.000]  and Drudge Report and others are now reporting, Salman Abadi.
[09:03.000 --> 09:04.000]  Who are the accomplices?
[09:04.000 --> 09:14.000]  Let me tell you, the Democratic Party, the Labour Party of the UK, Merkel's Party in Germany.
[09:14.000 --> 09:19.000]  People like Macron that says Islamic attacks are now part of life just accept it
[09:19.000 --> 09:24.000]  and the riots and the rapes and the car attacks and the stabbings and the shootings
[09:24.000 --> 09:30.000]  and the no-go zones everywhere and the mayor of London declaring it London stand
[09:30.000 --> 09:35.000]  and saying that it's now part of life just accept terror.
[09:35.000 --> 09:39.000]  It's never called Islamist.
[09:39.000 --> 09:41.000]  That's who's aiding and abetting.
[09:41.000 --> 09:42.000]  They keep saying, who was helping him?
[09:42.000 --> 09:43.000]  How did he do it?
[09:43.000 --> 09:48.000]  They've brought back thousands and thousands, just 1600 the last few months
[09:48.000 --> 09:54.000]  have come back into Europe and back into the UK who were actual ISIS fighters
[09:54.000 --> 09:56.000]  and who were on a watch list.
[09:56.000 --> 10:02.000]  There are more than 4,000 total on ISIS watch lists just in the UK alone
[10:02.000 --> 10:07.000]  and thousands more a month coming into Europe that Interpol allows in.
[10:07.000 --> 10:12.000]  They know they're ISIS fighters, they know they're al-Qaeda, they know they're Wahhabist
[10:12.000 --> 10:17.000]  and they let them back into the countries.
[10:17.000 --> 10:20.000]  So you ask who's behind this?
[10:20.000 --> 10:23.000]  The UN, the globalist, the refugee programs.
[10:23.000 --> 10:25.000]  George Soros pushing it.
[10:25.000 --> 10:31.000]  The UN certifies it's safe to bring them in, does no background checks, lets in known ISIS fighters,
[10:31.000 --> 10:34.000]  orders our State Department to let them in.
[10:34.000 --> 10:39.000]  That's what we live under and it's the same thing in the UK where the EU orders the UK
[10:39.000 --> 10:43.000]  on who to let in and if the UK doesn't let in ISIS fighters,
[10:43.000 --> 10:50.000]  they're fined up to 100,000 pounds for refusing entry.
[10:50.000 --> 10:54.000]  And they're talking about charging more, they're talking about a million euros,
[10:54.000 --> 10:59.000]  just type it into Google if you don't accept that.
[10:59.000 --> 11:03.000]  And so ladies and gentlemen, I'm sure many of the parents of the young people
[11:03.000 --> 11:06.000]  that were at this concert, many were adults, many were tweenies, many were teens,
[11:06.000 --> 11:10.000]  most adults probably there don't like having open borders to Islam.
[11:10.000 --> 11:16.000]  But I guarantee you a lot of the parents do want to go along with bringing in radical Islam.
[11:16.000 --> 11:24.000]  And bottom line, they are now responsible for this animal bombing and killing 22 plus people.
[11:24.000 --> 11:30.000]  The parents that call for open borders and call for appeasement are just as guilty as Macron
[11:30.000 --> 11:34.000]  and Merkel and Hillary Clinton and Obama and all the rest of them.
[11:34.000 --> 11:38.000]  You're the ones that have these dead children's blood on your hands.
[11:38.000 --> 11:42.000]  You're the trendies that love this. I was at the mall yesterday with my children.
[11:42.000 --> 11:46.000]  And many of the shops I walk by like Gap, we have some footage we can roll in a minute,
[11:46.000 --> 11:50.000]  show women in a jibs on their front billboards.
[11:50.000 --> 11:55.000]  The number one thing they're promoting is women in a jibs.
[11:55.000 --> 11:58.000]  It is absolutely being force fed to us.
[11:58.000 --> 12:03.000]  Just a few months ago at the inauguration, I saw them handing out thousands
[12:03.000 --> 12:06.000]  of American flag jibs to women.
[12:06.000 --> 12:11.000]  And I couldn't believe it. It turned out it was officially run by Muslims and George Soros funded it.
[12:11.000 --> 12:14.000]  And that it was an induction into Islam.
[12:14.000 --> 12:19.000]  And then we see it all over the news, USA Today, you name it, women wearing the jib,
[12:19.000 --> 12:25.000]  even if they're not Muslims, to stand against Trump.
[12:25.000 --> 12:28.000]  You just had the truck attack killing a bunch of people in Stockholm, Sweden.
[12:28.000 --> 12:30.000]  They wouldn't show the dead and dying people.
[12:30.000 --> 12:35.000]  They don't want to show you the dead teenagers and dead young people up close from Manchester,
[12:35.000 --> 12:38.000]  close to where Paul Watson's from.
[12:38.000 --> 12:42.000]  And then they have the nerve at Media Matters, openly funded by George Soros,
[12:42.000 --> 12:47.000]  the Nazi collaborator, to come out and say, Alex Jones blames the victims.
[12:47.000 --> 12:51.000]  And then they have their own people quoted and they're saying, kill me, shoot me, murder me.
[12:51.000 --> 12:54.000]  Well, I guess your Islamist will probably try.
[12:54.000 --> 13:00.000]  And what I actually said was, upwards of half the population in Britain in polls or more,
[13:00.000 --> 13:03.000]  one open borders and Muslims to be brought in.
[13:03.000 --> 13:07.000]  And so these are the people that are guilty of this.
[13:07.000 --> 13:14.000]  And you are guilty, if you promoted this, of aiding and abetting people that just went like cowards
[13:14.000 --> 13:19.000]  and bombed a bunch of innocent children.
[13:19.000 --> 13:24.000]  But see an upside down bizarro world, you have to invert it and say conservatives and libertarians
[13:24.000 --> 13:27.000]  and nationalists and just common sense people.
[13:27.000 --> 13:29.000]  We made the Muslims bad.
[13:29.000 --> 13:31.000]  We made them attack us.
[13:31.000 --> 13:32.000]  We have to appease them.
[13:32.000 --> 13:34.000]  We have to bow down to them.
[13:34.000 --> 13:36.000]  We have to go along with them better.
[13:36.000 --> 13:38.000]  And then everything would have been okay.
[13:38.000 --> 13:41.000]  Paul Joseph Watson joins us from London, England.
[13:41.000 --> 13:45.000]  We are then joined, ladies and gentlemen, at the bottom of the hour,
[13:45.000 --> 13:52.000]  by some of the other witnesses to what happened from the UK as well.
[13:52.000 --> 13:58.000]  Paul Watson will then be hosting the fourth hour.
[13:58.000 --> 14:02.000]  And we have Tommy Robinson again, who's from the front lines of exposing this.
[14:02.000 --> 14:04.000]  He'll be joining us coming up in about 20 minutes.
[14:04.000 --> 14:06.000]  But Paul Watson joins us right now.
[14:06.000 --> 14:10.000]  I'm going to play the clips of the mayor of London saying just get used to it.
[14:10.000 --> 14:12.000]  Just get used to it, baby.
[14:12.000 --> 14:14.000]  You're going to get cocked and cocked hard.
[14:14.000 --> 14:16.000]  And it's not his fault, though. It's my fault.
[14:16.000 --> 14:19.000]  Media matters doesn't say he shows any blame.
[14:19.000 --> 14:20.000]  It's me.
[14:20.000 --> 14:24.000]  George Soros, the Nazi collaborator, says it's my fault.
[14:24.000 --> 14:27.000]  It's your fault because you didn't bring in enough Muslims.
[14:27.000 --> 14:29.000]  You didn't cut enough genitals off women.
[14:29.000 --> 14:31.000]  You didn't put enough headdresses on them.
[14:31.000 --> 14:32.000]  You didn't bow down enough.
[14:32.000 --> 14:33.000]  You didn't give in enough.
[14:33.000 --> 14:36.000]  You didn't submit enough.
[14:36.000 --> 14:38.000]  You read the media matters.
[14:38.000 --> 14:39.000]  It's like I'm sick of Christians.
[14:39.000 --> 14:41.000]  We got a Christian problem.
[14:41.000 --> 14:44.000]  In the comments, we're going to get this Christian Jones.
[14:44.000 --> 14:46.000]  I bet it's Muslims and they're saying, kill me.
[14:46.000 --> 14:48.000]  And then we want to kill Jones.
[14:48.000 --> 14:50.000]  Yeah, let's kill him. Yeah.
[14:50.000 --> 14:52.000]  We're liberal. Let's kill him.
[14:52.000 --> 14:54.000]  It's his fault the Muslims killed people.
[14:54.000 --> 14:56.000]  It's Christians, though. They're the bad ones.
[14:56.000 --> 14:57.000]  Well, don't worry.
[14:57.000 --> 15:01.000]  What's left of a Christian culture just got bombed yesterday.
[15:01.000 --> 15:05.000]  God, you're a group of foaming at the mouth, middle patients.
[15:05.000 --> 15:08.000]  We have a real problem in this country and around the world.
[15:08.000 --> 15:12.000]  I'm not afraid to call it by the name radical Christian extremism.
[15:12.000 --> 15:15.000]  Well, let me give you statistics from your own UN, bud.
[15:15.000 --> 15:18.000]  They're at media matters.
[15:18.000 --> 15:20.000]  Christians are the number one persecuted group in the world,
[15:20.000 --> 15:21.000]  doubling everybody else.
[15:21.000 --> 15:25.000]  And that amount of attacks on Christians has doubled in the last decade.
[15:25.000 --> 15:26.000]  It's growing exponentially.
[15:26.000 --> 15:28.000]  And that's what Trump talked about now.
[15:28.000 --> 15:31.000]  Let's go to Paul Joseph Watson from London, England.
[15:31.000 --> 15:37.000]  To break this down, we have 22 dead, more than 50 injured.
[15:37.000 --> 15:39.000]  And the media is saying, why'd this happen?
[15:39.000 --> 15:40.000]  It's completely out of the blue.
[15:40.000 --> 15:43.000]  They tried to cover it up as an Islamic attack for 24 hours.
[15:43.000 --> 15:44.000]  It failed.
[15:44.000 --> 15:47.000]  Now the government of the UK has come out and said it is Islamic.
[15:47.000 --> 15:56.000]  The pitiful, slimy, disgusting, cowardly, out of control, ISIS people have taken credit.
[15:56.000 --> 15:58.000]  And the answer is bring more Islamists to stand.
[15:58.000 --> 15:59.000]  And I'll say this.
[15:59.000 --> 16:03.000]  I don't blame all the police, but the ones on top and the bureaucracy
[16:03.000 --> 16:06.000]  and the security services that just use these attacks to get more power
[16:06.000 --> 16:08.000]  but never stop the jihadis, Paul.
[16:08.000 --> 16:09.000]  They're to blame as well.
[16:09.000 --> 16:11.000]  Paul, who's to blame for this?
[16:11.000 --> 16:15.000]  Alex, the people to blame are the political class
[16:15.000 --> 16:18.000]  who have ranked in matter of importance,
[16:18.000 --> 16:21.000]  tolerance above the basic function of government,
[16:21.000 --> 16:24.000]  which is protecting the lives of its people.
[16:24.000 --> 16:28.000]  They think it's now more important to rank tolerance above that.
[16:28.000 --> 16:30.000]  What is tolerance?
[16:30.000 --> 16:34.000]  Tolerance of Muslim rape gangs that abduct young girls and abuse them
[16:34.000 --> 16:36.000]  for years and years and years.
[16:36.000 --> 16:39.000]  And the authorities don't do anything about it
[16:39.000 --> 16:41.000]  because it's politically incorrect.
[16:41.000 --> 16:44.000]  That's tolerance, tolerance of Sharia law,
[16:44.000 --> 16:47.000]  tolerance of women being abused and harassed on the street.
[16:47.000 --> 16:50.000]  Tolerance is now more important than the basic right to life.
[16:50.000 --> 16:54.000]  You were talking about political correctness before, Alex.
[16:54.000 --> 16:56.000]  You know, with the San Bernardino killings,
[16:56.000 --> 16:59.000]  we saw the neighbors were getting suspicious.
[16:59.000 --> 17:02.000]  They were taking in these suspicious parcels before the attacks.
[17:02.000 --> 17:04.000]  They were meeting with suspicious people.
[17:04.000 --> 17:08.000]  There was an incident right before this bombing last night in Manchester.
[17:08.000 --> 17:10.000]  And an eyewitness has come out and talked about it.
[17:10.000 --> 17:14.000]  She saw what was obviously, although she didn't say it directly,
[17:14.000 --> 17:17.000]  a foreign individual, probably a Muslim individual looking nervous,
[17:17.000 --> 17:20.000]  looking suspicious, fidgeting with something in her bag,
[17:20.000 --> 17:23.000]  looking back to the area where the bomb went off.
[17:23.000 --> 17:25.000]  She reported this woman.
[17:25.000 --> 17:28.000]  It looked like it was possibly one of the accomplices.
[17:28.000 --> 17:30.000]  She reported her to the security.
[17:30.000 --> 17:32.000]  What did the security say?
[17:32.000 --> 17:36.000]  They said to the woman who was trying to report the suspicious activity,
[17:36.000 --> 17:40.000]  how would you like it if somebody said that you were being suspicious?
[17:40.000 --> 17:43.000]  So it was obviously, by the way, she was describing it
[17:43.000 --> 17:45.000]  because she said she couldn't speak English very well.
[17:45.000 --> 17:49.000]  It was obviously possibly some kind of accomplice to this attack.
[17:49.000 --> 17:51.000]  The security did nothing about it.
[17:51.000 --> 17:54.000]  They didn't kick her out. They didn't even talk to her.
[17:54.000 --> 17:55.000]  They just left her alone.
[17:55.000 --> 17:57.000]  So it looks like that could have happened again.
[17:57.000 --> 18:00.000]  Again, that's not confirmed. But in the aftermath of this, Alex,
[18:00.000 --> 18:02.000]  what do we see again?
[18:02.000 --> 18:07.000]  Liberals leftists more outraged about offensive tweets
[18:07.000 --> 18:12.000]  than mangled dead kids than kids with body parts missing.
[18:12.000 --> 18:14.000]  That's what they're more offended about.
[18:14.000 --> 18:17.000]  The Met Police in London has come out and said,
[18:17.000 --> 18:20.000]  they're investigating not the ISIS terrorists,
[18:20.000 --> 18:22.000]  the hundreds of ISIS terrorists running around the country
[18:22.000 --> 18:24.000]  who have been let back in. No, no, no, no, no.
[18:24.000 --> 18:29.000]  They're investigating Katie Hopkins because she said something offensive on Twitter.
[18:29.000 --> 18:32.000]  They're actually doing this. This is what she said on Twitter.
[18:32.000 --> 18:35.000]  Western men, these are your wives, your daughters, your sons.
[18:35.000 --> 18:39.000]  Stand up, rise up, demand action. Do not carry on as normal.
[18:39.000 --> 18:44.000]  That is hate speech and is now being investigated by the Metropolitan Police
[18:44.000 --> 18:49.000]  after it was reported to them by offended leftists on Twitter.
[18:49.000 --> 18:51.000]  That's right. And Connie Robinson's joining us.
[18:51.000 --> 18:53.000]  He's the guy that first reported over a decade ago.
[18:53.000 --> 18:55.000]  They were kidnapping and grooming young girls.
[18:55.000 --> 18:57.000]  Now it's come out in dozens and dozens of towns,
[18:57.000 --> 19:01.000]  thousands per town, sex slavery, killing the young girls.
[19:01.000 --> 19:04.000]  And the police will do nothing because it's politically incorrect
[19:04.000 --> 19:06.000]  to talk bad about a bunch of men with big beards
[19:06.000 --> 19:09.000]  grabbing 10-year-old girls from the bus stops.
[19:09.000 --> 19:13.000]  I mean, this is just so over the top, the mass Stockholm syndrome
[19:13.000 --> 19:17.000]  that we're witnessing here, Paul.
[19:17.000 --> 19:20.000]  And it's Stockholm syndrome on steroids.
[19:20.000 --> 19:24.000]  The independent came out with a headline this morning, quote,
[19:24.000 --> 19:27.000]  there's only one way Britain should respond to attacks such as Manchester.
[19:27.000 --> 19:31.000]  That is by carrying on exactly as before.
[19:31.000 --> 19:35.000]  Just carry on, just forget about it, just wait until it happens again
[19:35.000 --> 19:36.000]  and again and again and again.
[19:36.000 --> 19:41.000]  You know, Alex, how do the parents of dead kids just carry on exactly as before?
[19:41.000 --> 19:45.000]  How do the teenage girls who have been dismembered,
[19:45.000 --> 19:49.000]  how are they going to carry on with life just as it was before?
[19:49.000 --> 19:53.000]  That's not bravery to just carry on like nothing's happening.
[19:53.000 --> 19:55.000]  That's frigging cowardice.
[19:55.000 --> 19:58.000]  But it seems, Alex, we've made a choice as a society.
[19:58.000 --> 20:01.000]  Again, our leaders place hurt feelings.
[20:01.000 --> 20:05.000]  They rank that as being more important than the actual basic survival
[20:05.000 --> 20:07.000]  and safety of their citizens.
[20:07.000 --> 20:09.000]  Sure, this is trauma-based mind control.
[20:09.000 --> 20:11.000]  They know these attacks are coming.
[20:11.000 --> 20:13.000]  They know that the trendies are being targeted.
[20:13.000 --> 20:16.000]  They know the helpless population has been domesticated into this position.
[20:16.000 --> 20:21.000]  And they are testing to just see what you'll put up with, what you'll go along with.
[20:21.000 --> 20:24.000]  I mean, first it's have taxpayers pay for sex changes.
[20:24.000 --> 20:28.000]  Then it's, oh, it's bad if you have a mother or father or if you're male or female.
[20:28.000 --> 20:30.000]  Now having a sex is bad.
[20:30.000 --> 20:34.000]  Now having your own identity is bad unless it's a liberal, trendy identity
[20:34.000 --> 20:35.000]  because this isn't liberal or trendy.
[20:35.000 --> 20:37.000]  This is an assault on the West.
[20:37.000 --> 20:38.000]  They'll use Islam.
[20:38.000 --> 20:40.000]  They'll use pedophile groups.
[20:40.000 --> 20:45.000]  They'll use anybody they can to scramble civilization to make us so confused
[20:45.000 --> 20:48.000]  with learned helplessness that we will then submit.
[20:48.000 --> 20:49.000]  I want to play this clip.
[20:49.000 --> 20:50.000]  This is so surreal.
[20:50.000 --> 20:53.000]  This was happening as the bombs had just gone off.
[20:53.000 --> 20:57.000]  They're now saying probably two bombs, a coordinated effort.
[20:57.000 --> 20:58.000]  But again, who's behind it?
[20:58.000 --> 20:59.000]  Who helped them?
[20:59.000 --> 21:00.000]  The government?
[21:00.000 --> 21:01.000]  Who protected them?
[21:01.000 --> 21:02.000]  The liberals?
[21:02.000 --> 21:03.000]  Who went along with it?
[21:03.000 --> 21:04.000]  The trendies?
[21:04.000 --> 21:06.000]  Who helped import these groups?
[21:06.000 --> 21:09.000]  Who backed ISIS and al-Qaeda in the Arab Spring?
[21:09.000 --> 21:11.000]  European and the U.S. government?
[21:11.000 --> 21:14.000]  The globalists are out live with radical Islam.
[21:14.000 --> 21:16.000]  Manchester Arena terror attack.
[21:16.000 --> 21:18.000]  No problems here, message.
[21:18.000 --> 21:22.000]  This is Sky News announcer who tries to calm the crowd.
[21:22.000 --> 21:27.000]  Guess a Sky event exiting the arena but goes a little too far.
[21:27.000 --> 21:28.000]  A little too far.
[21:28.000 --> 21:30.000]  It's like drink your kool-aid.
[21:30.000 --> 21:31.000]  Everything's fine.
[21:31.000 --> 21:32.000]  You'll be in heaven soon.
[21:32.000 --> 21:37.000]  Goes a little too far by claiming preemptively that there are no problems here
[21:37.000 --> 21:41.000]  and quote, we're glad you came out and had a good time tonight
[21:41.000 --> 21:46.000]  as if he were oblivious to the fact that someone just blew themselves up.
[21:46.000 --> 21:52.000]  So he's there announcing there at the Ariana Grande concert.
[21:52.000 --> 21:56.000]  Ariana Grande, it's so fun and nothing bad happened here tonight.
[21:56.000 --> 21:57.000]  Nothing went on.
[21:57.000 --> 21:58.000]  You had a great evening.
[21:58.000 --> 22:00.000]  Your steak was perfect.
[22:00.000 --> 22:03.000]  Like they say at restaurants, your wine was perfect.
[22:03.000 --> 22:08.000]  Your suicide bomb and flesh and guts and blood of teenagers was wonderful.
[22:08.000 --> 22:10.000]  You had a fabulous evening.
[22:10.000 --> 22:12.000]  People say, oh, this is Stockholm syndrome.
[22:12.000 --> 22:13.000]  This is mind control.
[22:13.000 --> 22:15.000]  This is Jim Jones Kool-Aid drills.
[22:15.000 --> 22:16.000]  It is.
[22:16.000 --> 22:20.000]  This is just one step more extreme of the media saying, move along.
[22:20.000 --> 22:21.000]  No big deal.
[22:21.000 --> 22:23.000]  The answer is bring in more Muslims.
[22:23.000 --> 22:25.000]  Have our young girls wear a jib.
[22:25.000 --> 22:27.000]  That will make the Muslims not kill us.
[22:27.000 --> 22:28.000]  Let's submit to them.
[22:28.000 --> 22:29.000]  Let's let them bully us.
[22:29.000 --> 22:34.000]  Let's roll over, you know, when we bring in folks from some areas in the Middle East
[22:34.000 --> 22:41.000]  that are 5,000 times plus more often to have birth defects or brain disorders from inbreeding.
[22:41.000 --> 22:45.000]  Let's bring in a bunch of inbred insane people and let them murder and kill us
[22:45.000 --> 22:48.000]  and kidnap our children and do everything because it's liberal
[22:48.000 --> 22:49.000]  and it's the right thing to do.
[22:49.000 --> 22:55.000]  Let's let the big brain bug Muslims bring in all of the little subgroups they're controlling
[22:55.000 --> 22:59.000]  and then own factories and facilities and have their little elves,
[22:59.000 --> 23:04.000]  brain damage inbred elves in their working in their basically slave factories.
[23:04.000 --> 23:09.000]  I mean, this is an absolute total takeover and our elites are out to get us.
[23:09.000 --> 23:15.000]  Here is the mind control right after the bombing telling folks they all had a great evening.
[23:15.000 --> 23:22.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, please take your time.
[23:22.000 --> 23:24.000]  There's no need to bunch up.
[23:24.000 --> 23:26.000]  There's no problems here.
[23:26.000 --> 23:29.000]  Let's take your time and keep exiting the building.
[23:29.000 --> 23:31.000]  There's no need to bunch up and ride on.
[23:31.000 --> 23:32.000]  Take your time.
[23:32.000 --> 23:34.000]  There's no problems here.
[23:34.000 --> 23:37.000]  Thank you for coming and having a good time tonight.
[23:37.000 --> 23:39.000]  Everything is fine.
[23:39.000 --> 23:41.000]  Let's take your time exiting the building.
[23:41.000 --> 23:42.000]  Thank you very much.
[23:42.000 --> 23:45.000]  Thanks for bringing your kids to the event.
[23:45.000 --> 23:49.000]  And no one's going to try to stop the Muslims coming in and blowing you up
[23:49.000 --> 23:51.000]  and some will argue, well, they don't want rioting.
[23:51.000 --> 23:53.000]  They don't want people stampeding and dying.
[23:53.000 --> 23:55.000]  You don't have to lie to them.
[23:55.000 --> 23:59.000]  They just say, please move orderly to the exits.
[23:59.000 --> 24:02.000]  It appears the event is over, whatever.
[24:02.000 --> 24:04.000]  But see, the government's bringing in the Muslims.
[24:04.000 --> 24:06.000]  It's bringing in the unvetted Muslims.
[24:06.000 --> 24:09.000]  It's bringing in the thousands of jihadis knowing this is going to happen.
[24:09.000 --> 24:11.000]  It's not like the media saying, be calm.
[24:11.000 --> 24:12.000]  Everything's going to be okay.
[24:12.000 --> 24:13.000]  We're going to fix this problem.
[24:13.000 --> 24:15.000]  We're going to deport these people.
[24:15.000 --> 24:16.000]  No, no, they're just saying, be calm.
[24:16.000 --> 24:17.000]  Everything's fine.
[24:17.000 --> 24:18.000]  Drink the Kool-Aid.
[24:18.000 --> 24:19.000]  You're going to be in heaven.
[24:19.000 --> 24:21.000]  Paul Watson.
[24:21.000 --> 24:24.000]  Well, Alex, the point is they're not just letting them in.
[24:24.000 --> 24:27.000]  And I'm going to do a big video expose about this as well.
[24:27.000 --> 24:30.000]  The NGO Boats, this is all George Soros funded.
[24:30.000 --> 24:33.000]  And I'm going to name the organizations by name.
[24:33.000 --> 24:39.000]  They're going out like a taxi service to 12 miles off the coast of Libya from Italy,
[24:39.000 --> 24:42.000]  picking up these migrants, bringing them back to Italy.
[24:42.000 --> 24:51.000]  Half of them just go missing while ISIS is literally paying their fee to pay the people smugglers if they join ISIS.
[24:51.000 --> 24:58.000]  ISIS said three years ago, quote, we're going to have a migrant flood to flood you with our jihadists and bring Europe down.
[24:58.000 --> 25:01.000]  The UN says, yes, opens it up, advertises it.
[25:01.000 --> 25:03.000]  It's a master plan, Paul.
[25:03.000 --> 25:04.000]  They've admitted it.
[25:04.000 --> 25:10.000]  What is the master plan bringing in the sleeper cell army of 5 million plus people, 80% military aged men?
[25:10.000 --> 25:12.000]  What are they planning?
[25:12.000 --> 25:17.000]  Well, on a purely selfish level, again, the elite, the political elite, they don't have to live amongst this.
[25:17.000 --> 25:22.000]  They get private chauffeurs to every single event they live in their ivory towers.
[25:22.000 --> 25:24.000]  They don't have to use public transport.
[25:24.000 --> 25:26.000]  They don't have to use commercial airlines.
[25:26.000 --> 25:28.000]  You know, they're protected from this.
[25:28.000 --> 25:29.000]  We're not.
[25:29.000 --> 25:32.000]  So they don't really have to live in the chaos that they create.
[25:32.000 --> 25:35.000]  Of course, politically, bringing in huge numbers of people.
[25:35.000 --> 25:42.000]  You can do a map where in Britain you compare the areas where the Muslim ghettos are versus who they vote for.
[25:42.000 --> 25:46.000]  It's always left wing political parties who will give them welfare and benefits.
[25:46.000 --> 25:48.000]  Same in any other European country.
[25:48.000 --> 25:50.000]  So that's the motive.
[25:50.000 --> 25:51.000]  They want huge voting blocks.
[25:51.000 --> 25:53.000]  They want to literally destroy society.
[25:53.000 --> 25:57.000]  They don't value or cherish Western values anymore.
[25:57.000 --> 26:05.000]  They've replaced them with this horrific tolerance idea, which is clearly not working for us, but they don't care because they're in their ivory towers.
[26:05.000 --> 26:11.000]  But this suicide bomber, Alex, Libyan refugee parents was born in Manchester.
[26:11.000 --> 26:16.000]  So we gave his parents refuge in the United Kingdom.
[26:16.000 --> 26:18.000]  They gave us a suicide bomber.
[26:18.000 --> 26:20.000]  Oh, but this guy was born here.
[26:20.000 --> 26:23.000]  So Alex, he's one of the integrated ones.
[26:23.000 --> 26:27.000]  He's another example of how multiculturalism has worked so well.
[26:27.000 --> 26:33.000]  Born in this country blows himself up along with 22, 23 other people.
[26:33.000 --> 26:39.000]  But don't worry, Alex, because CNN's Jake Tapper tweeted out an image of the Union Jack.
[26:39.000 --> 26:41.000]  So everything's going to be okay now.
[26:41.000 --> 26:44.000]  And that's what annoys me the most is the concern signaling.
[26:44.000 --> 26:45.000]  Well, that's what they do.
[26:45.000 --> 26:46.000]  The virtue signaling.
[26:46.000 --> 26:47.000]  Exactly, virtue signaling.
[26:47.000 --> 26:49.000]  They push for the end of the Union Jack.
[26:49.000 --> 26:51.000]  They try to say, don't fly at its races.
[26:51.000 --> 26:56.000]  First, they ban what the King George flag and a bunch of others.
[26:56.000 --> 26:58.000]  And so then they move on.
[26:58.000 --> 27:05.000]  But then when there's a tragic event, oh, here's your flag while the globalists are busy killing the culture, killing the identity.
[27:05.000 --> 27:11.000]  But then they kind of give you as a body bag, a Union Jack colored body bag.
[27:11.000 --> 27:12.000]  That was his though, Alex.
[27:12.000 --> 27:17.000]  He didn't tweet out a Russian flag last month when all those people got massacred in the St. Petersburg subway.
[27:17.000 --> 27:20.000]  Did he? Oh, no, it's selective outrage.
[27:20.000 --> 27:23.000]  Also, again, not all Muslims.
[27:23.000 --> 27:29.000]  The main concern immediately after 22 people, mostly teenage girls have been slaughtered and dismembered is not,
[27:29.000 --> 27:33.000]  what do we do to stop this from happening over and over again?
[27:33.000 --> 27:36.000]  Oh, no, somebody might be mean to Muslims.
[27:36.000 --> 27:37.000]  Don't be an Islamophobe.
[27:37.000 --> 27:39.000]  That's the main concern.
[27:39.000 --> 27:41.000]  No, it's not the main concern.
[27:41.000 --> 27:42.000]  It shouldn't be.
[27:42.000 --> 27:48.000]  And by the way, when Dylan Roof went in, when scumbag Dylan Roof went in and shot, you know, nine poor black people,
[27:48.000 --> 27:52.000]  because he was a brainwashed idiot, the media for months.
[27:52.000 --> 27:56.000]  It was the end of the world, America's evil, all conservatives are racist, all whites are racist.
[27:56.000 --> 28:00.000]  You've got a brown Muslim guy going and blowing up mainly a bunch of little white girls.
[28:00.000 --> 28:06.000]  Are folks going to call this racial? Because a big component of Islam is anti-white, anti-west.
[28:06.000 --> 28:09.000]  Let's just get that out there.
[28:09.000 --> 28:13.000]  Well, here's a tweet, Alex, and it exemplifies this.
[28:13.000 --> 28:16.000]  And this literally got like 50,000, 60,000 retweets.
[28:16.000 --> 28:21.000]  Muslims are to blame when in reality Muslim taxi drivers are offering free lift.
[28:21.000 --> 28:29.000]  Okay, so because some Muslim taxi drivers are offering free rides, that means there's not a problem with Islam and violence.
[28:29.000 --> 28:30.000]  No, it doesn't work like that.
[28:30.000 --> 28:33.000]  But that is the level of idiocy we're dealing with.
[28:33.000 --> 28:37.000]  That is literally the most tweeted thing today on Twitter.
[28:37.000 --> 28:39.000]  That's what we're dealing with.
[28:39.000 --> 28:40.000]  Again, empty platitudes.
[28:40.000 --> 28:41.000]  Really, you know what's funny?
[28:41.000 --> 28:45.000]  The last few times I was in the UK, it was almost all Muslim taxi drivers.
[28:45.000 --> 28:52.000]  They would shake me down for double the rate to take me to my hotel laughing at me until I would run into a British taxi driver.
[28:52.000 --> 29:00.000]  And they would let me in and actually only charge me the regular rate and apologize to me and say, you know, this is London stand now, mate.
[29:00.000 --> 29:03.000]  Yeah, but it's, again, look at the stats.
[29:03.000 --> 29:05.000]  Okay, it's not a tiny fringe.
[29:05.000 --> 29:13.000]  34% of British Muslims say they would not inform police if they knew someone was getting involved with ISIS.
[29:13.000 --> 29:17.000]  34%, sorry, only 34% would inform.
[29:17.000 --> 29:24.000]  So in fact, the vast majority of British Muslims would not tell police if someone they knew was joining ISIS.
[29:24.000 --> 29:26.000]  We saw the same thing in Belgium after Paris.
[29:26.000 --> 29:28.000]  But it's not the Muslims fault.
[29:28.000 --> 29:30.000]  It's conservatives, nationalist libertarians.
[29:30.000 --> 29:31.000]  And it's my fault, Paul.
[29:31.000 --> 29:34.000]  Media Matters is saying it's my fault.
[29:34.000 --> 29:35.000]  I'm a bad fact.
[29:35.000 --> 29:36.000]  I don't like the children that died.
[29:36.000 --> 29:37.000]  Total lie.
[29:37.000 --> 29:42.000]  I'm saying the trendies in the UK that say open the borders up, bring this in, they're to blame.
[29:42.000 --> 29:48.000]  And you know that stadium had adults and others that were in it that totally are cuckold and are pushing for this.
[29:48.000 --> 29:49.000]  The left has to embrace it.
[29:49.000 --> 29:50.000]  You love Islam.
[29:50.000 --> 29:52.000]  You love sexual mutilation.
[29:52.000 --> 29:53.000]  You love Hajjibs.
[29:53.000 --> 29:54.000]  Paul Watson.
[29:54.000 --> 29:55.000]  Alex Jones.
[29:55.000 --> 29:56.000]  Be safe.
[29:56.000 --> 29:59.000]  Tommy Robinson from the UK as well coming up.

[2:50:11.000 --> 2:50:40.000]  Thank you very much.
[2:50:41.000 --> 2:51:10.000]  Thank you very much.
[2:51:11.000 --> 2:51:38.000]  Thank you very much.
[2:51:38.000 --> 2:52:00.000]  Thank you very much.
[2:52:00.000 --> 2:52:29.000]  Thank you very much.
[2:52:30.000 --> 2:52:59.000]  Thank you very much.
[2:53:00.000 --> 2:53:27.000]  Thank you very much.
[2:53:27.000 --> 2:53:56.000]  Thank you very much.
[2:53:57.000 --> 2:54:26.000]  Thank you very much.
[2:54:27.000 --> 2:54:56.000]  Thank you very much.
[2:54:57.000 --> 2:55:26.000]  Thank you very much.
[2:55:27.000 --> 2:55:56.000]  Thank you very much.
[2:55:57.000 --> 2:56:26.000]  Thank you very much.
[2:56:27.000 --> 2:56:56.000]  Thank you very much.
[2:56:57.000 --> 2:57:26.000]  Thank you very much.
[2:57:27.000 --> 2:57:54.000]  Thank you very much.
[2:57:54.000 --> 2:58:22.000]  Thank you very much.
[2:58:22.000 --> 2:58:51.000]  Thank you very much.
[2:58:52.000 --> 2:59:21.000]  Thank you very much.
[2:59:22.000 --> 2:59:51.000]  Thank you very much.
[2:59:53.000 --> 3:00:02.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:00:02.000 --> 3:00:23.000]  Again, it's not the Muslims. It's this big collapse, this big setup.
[3:00:23.000 --> 3:00:35.000]  You could think of this as aliens that run the planet.
[3:00:35.000 --> 3:00:44.000]  It's like a crazy video game.
[3:00:44.000 --> 3:00:48.760]  find it and then make them the richest people in the world and then now they're like sending
[3:00:48.760 --> 3:00:54.400]  out people all over the world as missionaries that blow you up and kill you and look other
[3:00:54.400 --> 3:00:56.560]  orthodox religions have done bad things as well.
[3:00:56.560 --> 3:00:59.040]  I don't want to kill Muslims.
[3:00:59.040 --> 3:01:03.440]  I just know that our governments are working with them and allowing this to happen and
[3:01:03.440 --> 3:01:06.960]  it's wrong and those of us that criticize it are attacked.
[3:01:06.960 --> 3:01:11.840]  I used to be brainwashed 15 years ago and get mad if you criticize Muslims.
[3:01:11.840 --> 3:01:16.560]  I knew they were backward and had problems but I didn't want to go bomb them and stuff.
[3:01:16.560 --> 3:01:20.400]  I guess I was right because that stirred them up but there was a larger plan.
[3:01:20.400 --> 3:01:24.320]  The same people bombing them are the ones putting the radicals in charge and then opening
[3:01:24.320 --> 3:01:25.600]  our borders up to them.
[3:01:25.600 --> 3:01:28.320]  So what's the big master plan?
[3:01:28.320 --> 3:01:31.280]  Trevor in Canada than Cindy in Pennsylvania.
[3:01:31.280 --> 3:01:32.280]  Trevor you're on the air.
[3:01:32.280 --> 3:01:34.280]  Hey Alex, how are you doing?
[3:01:34.280 --> 3:01:35.280]  Good brother.
[3:01:35.280 --> 3:01:41.320]  Hey I just want to chat about how on earth you have a reformation in Islam.
[3:01:41.320 --> 3:01:44.640]  And the roots of it are so poised.
[3:01:44.640 --> 3:01:48.840]  How do you, like there's been reformations like the Taliban, Al Qaeda and all that stuff.
[3:01:48.840 --> 3:01:53.320]  I don't understand how you can reform something that has poisoned roots to it.
[3:01:53.320 --> 3:01:58.520]  No I hear you, I mean I got to be honest with you.
[3:01:58.520 --> 3:01:59.520]  So what do we do?
[3:01:59.520 --> 3:02:00.520]  I mean you've got a billion and a half of these people.
[3:02:00.520 --> 3:02:01.520]  What do you do?
[3:02:01.520 --> 3:02:04.600]  That's the real question.
[3:02:04.600 --> 3:02:09.200]  At least something you've got to, you know, anything that doesn't coincide with Western
[3:02:09.200 --> 3:02:12.000]  values is something that shouldn't be around.
[3:02:12.000 --> 3:02:15.640]  Well here's the deal, they could have their countries.
[3:02:15.640 --> 3:02:18.080]  It's just that they're obsessed with taking everything over.
[3:02:18.080 --> 3:02:22.760]  That's why they're constantly killing each other because they're not an open free society.
[3:02:22.760 --> 3:02:27.240]  Then they use our openness and our freedom to ally with the left to then try to get rid
[3:02:27.240 --> 3:02:29.240]  of our openness and freedom.
[3:02:29.240 --> 3:02:33.480]  It's just, there's no logic to the feminists and people except they're just a bunch of
[3:02:33.480 --> 3:02:35.360]  white flag cowards.
[3:02:35.360 --> 3:02:41.360]  Well no kidding, they're with them promoting the hijab and everything when the hijab's
[3:02:41.360 --> 3:02:45.760]  origins were to differentiate between your wives and your sex slaves.
[3:02:45.760 --> 3:02:49.560]  I don't understand how they could promote something like that as a feminine so-called.
[3:02:49.560 --> 3:02:52.120]  That's right, for folks that don't know the history, why don't you tell them about the
[3:02:52.120 --> 3:02:56.320]  difference between a wife and a sex slave, who or what?
[3:02:56.320 --> 3:03:01.400]  I forget which is which, I believe it was a sex slave that wore the hijab, I can't
[3:03:01.400 --> 3:03:05.840]  remember off the top of my head to be honest, but either way it's a symbol of oppression
[3:03:05.840 --> 3:03:11.880]  and I don't understand it, especially with what it's referring to between differentiating
[3:03:11.880 --> 3:03:13.400]  between wives and sex slaves.
[3:03:13.400 --> 3:03:18.960]  Well imagine if a black guy or a Hispanic guy or a white guy, Christian, whatever, said
[3:03:18.960 --> 3:03:22.240]  you're going to wear a hood over your head, I'm going to cut your genitals off, people
[3:03:22.240 --> 3:03:28.720]  put you in prison, you'd say, oh he had his wife as a slave, what, I mean it's like ridiculous,
[3:03:28.720 --> 3:03:29.720]  we should reject it.
[3:03:29.720 --> 3:03:34.480]  Okay, Trevor, great points, Cindy and Pennsylvania are on the air.
[3:03:34.480 --> 3:03:43.160]  Hi, hi Alex, thanks for taking my call, thanks for that segment with Tommy Robinson, what
[3:03:43.160 --> 3:03:49.840]  amazing bravery that man has, I think we all need to get behind him, I've been racking
[3:03:49.840 --> 3:03:55.240]  my brain because he's in so much danger, I mean I watched him with the frustration
[3:03:55.240 --> 3:04:03.560]  in him, it just made me cry, but I had one idea of a t-shirt, Tommy Robinson with a picture
[3:04:03.560 --> 3:04:09.400]  of his face, it begins with one, I'm not a rich person, but if I was, I would put that
[3:04:09.400 --> 3:04:10.400]  out.
[3:04:10.400 --> 3:04:15.600]  Oh, with Robinson doesn't the sincerity come right across very, very strong, and he really
[3:04:15.600 --> 3:04:22.920]  has been the polar bearer in the UK in the last 15 years, anything else Cindy?
[3:04:22.920 --> 3:04:28.120]  I was in him, pardon me, I'm sorry, your phone cut out, go ahead.
[3:04:28.120 --> 3:04:36.080]  If we had just 100 of him, what we could do, but I would love to see a t-shirt, it begins
[3:04:36.080 --> 3:04:41.360]  with one, Tommy Robinson, he needs bodyguards or something, I fear for his safety.
[3:04:41.360 --> 3:04:45.280]  Well he's been in prison, they beat him up, he gets it done, I mean the guys, it's crazy,
[3:04:45.280 --> 3:04:49.640]  I mean let me tell you something, one reason I started becoming anti-Islam was going to
[3:04:49.640 --> 3:04:54.400]  Europe in England, and man they just get in your face like you are a dog, because they're
[3:04:54.400 --> 3:04:59.240]  so used to the brits rolling over, and I'm just like what on earth, Paul Watson's coming
[3:04:59.240 --> 3:05:01.400]  up speaking of the brits.
[3:05:01.400 --> 3:05:06.320]  Duty, honor, country, those three hallowed words reverently dictate what you ought to
[3:05:06.320 --> 3:05:12.200]  be, what you can be, what you will be, they are your rallying points, to build courage
[3:05:12.200 --> 3:05:17.480]  when courage seems to fail, to regain faith when there seems to be little cause for faith,
[3:05:17.480 --> 3:05:22.960]  to create hope when hope becomes forlorn, unhappily I possess neither that eloquence
[3:05:22.960 --> 3:05:28.160]  of dictation, that poetry of imagination, nor that brilliance of metaphor to tell you
[3:05:28.160 --> 3:05:33.400]  all that they mean, the unbelievers will say they are but words, but a slogan, but a flamboyant
[3:05:33.400 --> 3:05:39.000]  phrase, every demagogue, every cynic, every hypocrite, every troublemaker, and I am sorry
[3:05:39.000 --> 3:05:43.560]  to say some others of an entirely different character will try to downgrade them even
[3:05:43.560 --> 3:05:47.880]  to the extent of mockery and ridicule, but these are some of the things they do.
[3:05:47.880 --> 3:05:52.640]  They build your basic character, they mold you for the future roles as a custodian of
[3:05:52.640 --> 3:05:54.200]  the nation's defense.
[3:05:54.200 --> 3:06:01.280]  This was said on May 12th, 1962 by General Douglas MacArthur, I'm Joe Biggs with Infowars.com.
[3:06:01.280 --> 3:06:05.640]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[3:06:05.640 --> 3:06:10.360]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[3:06:10.360 --> 3:06:11.880]  to detoxify the body.
[3:06:11.880 --> 3:06:16.720]  That's why I'm introducing ZShield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[3:06:16.720 --> 3:06:21.920]  It's made in the USA, it's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely
[3:06:21.920 --> 3:06:25.000]  associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the Info War.
[3:06:25.000 --> 3:06:27.280]  It is a classical 360 win.
[3:06:27.280 --> 3:06:31.760]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe
[3:06:31.760 --> 3:06:36.440]  we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly
[3:06:36.440 --> 3:06:37.440]  get.
[3:06:37.440 --> 3:06:40.640]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this
[3:06:40.640 --> 3:06:45.680]  country and the world that Patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you
[3:06:45.680 --> 3:06:50.920]  can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the
[3:06:50.920 --> 3:06:53.640]  next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[3:06:53.640 --> 3:06:56.920]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[3:06:56.920 --> 3:07:00.960]  Now it's time to change our bodies with ZShield at InfowarsLive.com.
[3:07:00.960 --> 3:07:04.680]  A new shipment of Biotrusillinium is now available at InfowarsLive.com.
[3:07:04.680 --> 3:07:06.560]  We've been sold out for months.
[3:07:06.560 --> 3:07:11.680]  Our one-of-a-kind InfowarsLife Biotrusillinium formula is now back in stock at InfowarsLive.com.
[3:07:11.680 --> 3:07:15.720]  This is the true selenium formula that has rocked the nutraceutical industry to its core.
[3:07:15.720 --> 3:07:20.320]  Nearly every other selenium supplement on the market is produced with synthetic selenium,
[3:07:20.320 --> 3:07:25.440]  but Biotrusillinium is made from a source of 100% organic mustard seed.
[3:07:25.440 --> 3:07:28.960]  The effects of the essential trace mineral selenium are well known.
[3:07:28.960 --> 3:07:34.000]  From supporting the thyroid gland and immune system to DNA production and eyesight, Biotrusillinium
[3:07:34.000 --> 3:07:39.120]  is also the perfect supercharger to survival shield X2 nascent iodine, as both help support
[3:07:39.120 --> 3:07:41.160]  a healthy thyroid and many other systems.
[3:07:41.160 --> 3:07:46.000]  Visit InfowarsLive.com to order your bottle of Biotrusillinium before we sell out again.
[3:07:46.000 --> 3:07:50.360]  That's InfowarsLive.com to secure your selenium and other key products that don't only help
[3:07:50.360 --> 3:07:55.120]  yourself and your family, but also fund our operation against the globalist, A360 Winton.
[3:07:55.120 --> 3:07:57.240]  We didn't ask for this fight, but we're in this fight.
[3:07:57.240 --> 3:07:58.760]  This is the time to support Infowars.
[3:07:58.760 --> 3:08:05.760]  This is InfowarsLive.com.
[3:08:28.760 --> 3:08:35.960]  We're live, it's the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show with me, Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:08:35.960 --> 3:08:41.200]  Now obviously we've spoken at length about the tragedy that happened last night in Manchester,
[3:08:41.200 --> 3:08:42.200]  England.
[3:08:42.200 --> 3:08:43.200]  We're going to get more into that.
[3:08:43.200 --> 3:08:48.560]  We're also going to cover the situation in Libya or just off the coast of Libya.
[3:08:48.560 --> 3:08:52.360]  And this is what most people don't realize about the, quote, refugee crisis.
[3:08:52.360 --> 3:08:54.960]  It's not a refugee crisis.
[3:08:54.960 --> 3:09:00.640]  Because people hold up the refugee welcome signs, they don't even scratch one inch below
[3:09:00.640 --> 3:09:01.640]  the surface.
[3:09:01.640 --> 3:09:08.920]  We're talking about these NGO boats literally going 12 miles off the coast of Libya to pick
[3:09:08.920 --> 3:09:15.440]  up migrants, some of whom have been paid by ISIS to cover their fee that they pay the
[3:09:15.440 --> 3:09:22.920]  people smugglers to get across the Mediterranean with the NGOs being in illegal communication
[3:09:22.920 --> 3:09:25.440]  with the people smugglers.
[3:09:25.440 --> 3:09:28.080]  Most people have no idea that this is going on.
[3:09:28.080 --> 3:09:33.600]  It's something that we can stop if we know the details, if we support the parties that
[3:09:33.600 --> 3:09:36.560]  are trying to stop it there in Italy.
[3:09:36.560 --> 3:09:39.760]  So I'm going to get into a detailed breakdown about that.
[3:09:39.760 --> 3:09:45.040]  And obviously we're talking about what happened in Manchester now to set the table for Manchester.
[3:09:45.040 --> 3:09:50.240]  This video just went up about an hour ago on YouTube and on Infowars.com.
[3:09:50.240 --> 3:09:53.960]  It is Manchester attack what they're not telling you.
[3:09:53.960 --> 3:09:54.960]  Here's the video.
[3:09:54.960 --> 3:09:59.520]  Europe has been hit with yet another terrorist atrocity after at least 22 people were killed
[3:09:59.520 --> 3:10:03.160]  in an attack on the Manchester arena claimed by ISIS.
[3:10:03.160 --> 3:10:08.280]  The second attack on the UK in the space of two months, victims, many of them teenage
[3:10:08.280 --> 3:10:11.400]  girls, massacred, mutilated, maimed.
[3:10:11.400 --> 3:10:13.200]  Why does this keep happening?
[3:10:13.200 --> 3:10:18.680]  Because our political class has demoted the most basic role of government to protect the
[3:10:18.680 --> 3:10:22.880]  lives of its people and replaced it with a different role.
[3:10:22.880 --> 3:10:24.040]  Tolerance.
[3:10:24.040 --> 3:10:26.880]  Tolerance of women being abused and harassed on the street.
[3:10:26.880 --> 3:10:31.080]  Tolerance of rape gangs abducting and abusing young girls for years.
[3:10:31.080 --> 3:10:33.760]  Tolerance of all the barbarisms of Sharia law.
[3:10:33.760 --> 3:10:35.800]  Tolerance of terrorist attacks.
[3:10:35.800 --> 3:10:40.560]  Tolerance is now more important than the basic right to life.
[3:10:40.560 --> 3:10:41.560]  Tolerance.
[3:10:41.560 --> 3:10:45.560]  Tolerance of terror being part and parcel of living in a major city according to London
[3:10:45.560 --> 3:10:52.560]  Massadee Khan.
[3:10:52.560 --> 3:10:56.280]  Just carry on.
[3:10:56.280 --> 3:10:57.280]  Forget about it.
[3:10:57.280 --> 3:11:01.800]  Be tolerant until it happens again and again and again.
[3:11:01.800 --> 3:11:06.760]  Tell me, how do the parents of dead kids just carry on exactly as before?
[3:11:06.760 --> 3:11:12.480]  How do the teenage girls whose legs have been blown off just carry on exactly as before?
[3:11:12.480 --> 3:11:15.680]  As much as I'm praying for Manchester, I'm praying for Muslims who have to deal with
[3:11:15.680 --> 3:11:18.040]  racism and islamophobia due to this tragedy.
[3:11:18.040 --> 3:11:22.400]  Right, so that's what our main concern should be after dozens of children have been blown
[3:11:22.400 --> 3:11:23.400]  up.
[3:11:23.400 --> 3:11:25.200]  People being mean to Muslims.
[3:11:25.200 --> 3:11:27.880]  As a society, we need to make a choice.
[3:11:27.880 --> 3:11:30.200]  Which do we value more?
[3:11:30.200 --> 3:11:35.480]  Protecting the feelings of Muslims or preventing our children from being blown up.
[3:11:35.480 --> 3:11:38.920]  Muslims are to blame when in reality Muslim taxi drivers are offering free lifts than a
[3:11:38.920 --> 3:11:41.120]  Muslim doctor working into the night saving lives.
[3:11:41.120 --> 3:11:45.840]  Yeah, the fact that some Muslim taxi drivers are offering free lifts doesn't negate the
[3:11:45.840 --> 3:11:48.520]  fact that Islam has a problem with violence.
[3:11:48.520 --> 3:11:50.280]  You utter moron.
[3:11:50.280 --> 3:11:53.040]  Islamophobia and sickening fake news is right.
[3:11:53.040 --> 3:11:56.560]  Tonight is showing a lot of people to be vile humans.
[3:11:56.560 --> 3:12:02.880]  Yeah, vile humans follow a belief system that justifies massacring teenagers at a pop concert.
[3:12:02.880 --> 3:12:08.440]  Should we concentrate on stopping them or be more angry at inaccurate tweets?
[3:12:08.440 --> 3:12:11.760]  Reangle the pulse about Manchester just reminds me of how we only notice it if it happens
[3:12:11.760 --> 3:12:12.960]  to white people.
[3:12:12.960 --> 3:12:18.640]  Right, so the main complaint should be all those disgusting white people demanding attention
[3:12:18.640 --> 3:12:20.200]  for being slaughtered.
[3:12:20.200 --> 3:12:21.200]  How dare they?
[3:12:21.200 --> 3:12:26.280]  And in these times of our children being blown to bits by terrorists, it's vital to point
[3:12:26.280 --> 3:12:27.800]  out the real danger.
[3:12:27.800 --> 3:12:31.960]  Katie Hopkins' offensive tweets, being angry at Tommy Robinson.
[3:12:31.960 --> 3:12:32.960]  That's more important.
[3:12:32.960 --> 3:12:38.200]  I've come to realise that a lot of this hashtag pray for whatever concern signalling is
[3:12:38.200 --> 3:12:39.760]  worse than glib.
[3:12:39.760 --> 3:12:42.040]  It's repugnant narcissism.
[3:12:42.040 --> 3:12:46.920]  People who see something horrible happen in the world and they run to the internet and
[3:12:46.920 --> 3:12:51.360]  they run to their social media, their Facebook, their Twitter, whatever they got and they
[3:12:51.360 --> 3:12:57.720]  all write down the exact same thing.
[3:12:57.720 --> 3:13:01.680]  My thoughts and prayers.
[3:13:01.680 --> 3:13:04.880]  My thoughts and prayers with the people in Aurora.
[3:13:04.880 --> 3:13:08.800]  My thoughts and prayers with the families in Boston.
[3:13:08.800 --> 3:13:10.800]  Do you know what that's worth?
[3:13:10.800 --> 3:13:12.280]  Nothing.
[3:13:12.280 --> 3:13:19.760]  Fucking less than nothing.
[3:13:19.760 --> 3:13:21.680]  Less than nothing.
[3:13:21.680 --> 3:13:25.280]  You are not giving any of your time, your money or even your compassion.
[3:13:25.280 --> 3:13:31.720]  All you are doing, all you are doing is saying, don't forget about me today.
[3:13:31.720 --> 3:13:34.960]  Your thoughts and prayers count for nothing.
[3:13:34.960 --> 3:13:37.880]  CNN's Jake Tapper posting a Union Jack.
[3:13:37.880 --> 3:13:43.360]  Hey Jake, I don't recall you posting a Russian flag when all those innocent people got blown
[3:13:43.360 --> 3:13:48.320]  up in the St. Petersburg subway last month, was political correctness to blame for one
[3:13:48.320 --> 3:13:51.720]  of the accomplices in the attack escaping detection?
[3:13:51.720 --> 3:13:56.360]  This eyewitness says she spotted a woman acting suspiciously and told security but
[3:13:56.360 --> 3:13:57.360]  they did nothing.
[3:13:57.360 --> 3:14:03.400]  It looked very suspicious, she was fidgeting all the time with a bag on the floor, across
[3:14:03.400 --> 3:14:05.240]  her, she was by herself.
[3:14:05.240 --> 3:14:09.000]  What was she doing?
[3:14:09.000 --> 3:14:13.240]  She was looking in the direction of where the explosion actually happened all night
[3:14:13.240 --> 3:14:14.880]  and smacking to herself.
[3:14:14.880 --> 3:14:19.880]  The suspicious individual was hard to understand suggesting English wasn't her first language.
[3:14:19.880 --> 3:14:25.040]  The woman who reported the incident was then lectured for making the suspicious individual
[3:14:25.040 --> 3:14:26.040]  feel uncomfortable.
[3:14:26.040 --> 3:14:31.520]  I would you like it if someone accused you of this, we're looking to it and nothing
[3:14:31.520 --> 3:14:32.520]  was done about it.
[3:14:32.520 --> 3:14:37.480]  One to two minutes before the concept finished this lady disappeared and then of course the
[3:14:37.480 --> 3:14:38.680]  explosion went off.
[3:14:38.680 --> 3:14:44.040]  Is she suggesting that security did nothing because the suspicious individual was Muslim
[3:14:44.040 --> 3:14:48.440]  and to ask her to leave would have been politically incorrect, we'll never know.
[3:14:48.440 --> 3:14:52.680]  What we do know is this, almost certainly nothing will change.
[3:14:52.680 --> 3:14:57.800]  There are things we can change, mass surveillance of hate preaching mosques, solitary confinement
[3:14:57.800 --> 3:15:03.360]  of individuals who are likely to radicalise others in prison, extreme vetting and strict
[3:15:03.360 --> 3:15:09.240]  quotas on Muslim immigration, deporting known terrorists, prosecuting NGOs who send out
[3:15:09.240 --> 3:15:16.320]  boats to rescue unvetted migrants, some of whom sympathise with or are members of ISIS.
[3:15:16.320 --> 3:15:20.760]  But again, nothing is going to change because we have a political class and a culture that
[3:15:20.760 --> 3:15:26.520]  deems hurt feelings to be of more concern than mangled dead children.
[3:15:26.520 --> 3:15:31.120]  90% of terror victims are Muslims killed by other Muslims.
[3:15:31.120 --> 3:15:33.240]  This is the culture we're importing.
[3:15:33.240 --> 3:15:38.480]  Just 34% of British Muslims would inform police if they knew someone was getting involved
[3:15:38.480 --> 3:15:39.960]  with ISIS.
[3:15:39.960 --> 3:15:45.480]  32% refused to condemn those who take part in violence against those who mocked the
[3:15:45.480 --> 3:15:46.840]  Prophet Muhammad.
[3:15:46.840 --> 3:15:52.800]  One in four British Muslims believe that the 77 attacks in London were justified.
[3:15:52.800 --> 3:15:57.240]  ISIS fighters are returning from Syria and flooding into Europe en masse under cover
[3:15:57.240 --> 3:16:02.120]  of the refugee wave and European countries are welcoming them in.
[3:16:02.120 --> 3:16:03.520]  Because tolerance.
[3:16:03.520 --> 3:16:04.640]  This is tolerance.
[3:16:04.640 --> 3:16:06.080]  This is diversity.
[3:16:06.080 --> 3:16:09.400]  This is the future our leaders have chosen for us.
[3:16:09.400 --> 3:16:11.280]  But we have a choice.
[3:16:11.280 --> 3:16:12.280]  We have hope.
[3:16:12.280 --> 3:16:15.000]  Don't let them tell you not to be angry.
[3:16:15.000 --> 3:16:20.280]  Don't let them tell you to just go on with life as normal because that's not bravery.
[3:16:20.280 --> 3:16:21.520]  It's cowardice.
[3:16:21.520 --> 3:16:23.040]  Enough hashtags.
[3:16:23.040 --> 3:16:24.440]  Enough vigils.
[3:16:24.440 --> 3:16:26.920]  Enough celebrity platitudes.
[3:16:26.920 --> 3:16:28.480]  It hasn't worked.
[3:16:28.480 --> 3:16:29.720]  We need change.
[3:16:29.720 --> 3:16:31.320]  We need action.
[3:16:31.320 --> 3:16:33.200]  Hope has two beautiful daughters.
[3:16:33.200 --> 3:16:36.120]  Their names are anger and courage.
[3:16:36.120 --> 3:16:43.920]  Anger at the way things are and courage to see that they do not remain as they are.
[3:16:43.920 --> 3:16:47.480]  And that is what they're not telling you about the Manchester attack.
[3:16:47.480 --> 3:16:51.720]  Now I mentioned there in the video, everyone made a huge deal about, oh, there were some
[3:16:51.720 --> 3:16:56.960]  Muslim taxi drivers who were offering free lifts to the people trying to get home after
[3:16:56.960 --> 3:16:57.960]  that tragedy.
[3:16:57.960 --> 3:17:01.840]  Now, I'm sure there were some that were offering free lifts.
[3:17:01.840 --> 3:17:03.680]  But Cosmopolitan took this.
[3:17:03.680 --> 3:17:05.320]  They put out a tweet.
[3:17:05.320 --> 3:17:07.360]  And if you go onto my Twitter page, you can scroll down.
[3:17:07.360 --> 3:17:10.000]  It's on there as of about an hour ago.
[3:17:10.000 --> 3:17:16.720]  They put out a tweet with a picture of a Sikh man saying that he was a Muslim offering
[3:17:16.720 --> 3:17:17.720]  free lifts.
[3:17:17.720 --> 3:17:21.800]  Now, you could understand if they were just stupid and they're mistaking a Sikh for a
[3:17:21.800 --> 3:17:22.800]  Muslim.
[3:17:22.800 --> 3:17:26.200]  It's pretty easy to tell based on the headgear.
[3:17:26.200 --> 3:17:30.520]  But they asked the originator of this photo for permission to use it.
[3:17:30.520 --> 3:17:37.960]  And in the original tweet that this Sikh guy posted, he said he was a Sikh Cosmopolitan
[3:17:37.960 --> 3:17:43.880]  deliberately twisted that they took it and claimed he was a Muslim again, because virtue
[3:17:43.880 --> 3:17:48.480]  signaling about Muslims and Islamophobia, that's the main concern.
[3:17:48.480 --> 3:17:53.960]  That's the numero-umero thing that everybody has to do after an Islamic terrorist has slaughtered
[3:17:53.960 --> 3:17:59.280]  22 people, 23 people and maimed dozens more.
[3:17:59.280 --> 3:18:01.480]  That is the most important thing.
[3:18:01.480 --> 3:18:07.320]  Yeah, I just imagine if some of these leftists got as I rate about Islamic terrorism as they
[3:18:07.320 --> 3:18:08.320]  did.
[3:18:08.320 --> 3:18:09.320]  Oh, I don't know.
[3:18:09.320 --> 3:18:13.640]  People with opinions with which they don't agree.
[3:18:13.640 --> 3:18:18.160]  Remember Antifa, remember Berkeley, remember the absolute bedlam that takes place when
[3:18:18.160 --> 3:18:23.200]  anyone dares express an opinion that goes against their leftist consensus.
[3:18:23.200 --> 3:18:26.240]  They go absolutely ape.
[3:18:26.240 --> 3:18:31.200]  When something like this happens now, we're bad, we're bad for talking about Islam.
[3:18:31.200 --> 3:18:33.680]  I'll give you another example.
[3:18:33.680 --> 3:18:39.280]  When we put out a tweet earlier, which said, as we talked about earlier, Katie Hopkins
[3:18:39.280 --> 3:18:45.800]  is literally under police investigation for a tweet, which basically said we need men
[3:18:45.800 --> 3:18:47.880]  to stand up against Islamic terrorism.
[3:18:47.880 --> 3:18:50.680]  That's basically all that it said.
[3:18:50.680 --> 3:18:53.000]  She's under police investigation for that now.
[3:18:53.000 --> 3:18:55.520]  They're visiting mosques, okay?
[3:18:55.520 --> 3:19:02.280]  This bomber came from Wally Range in Manchester, which is an area that has an area of Manchester
[3:19:02.280 --> 3:19:05.560]  that has four mosques, Wally Range.
[3:19:05.560 --> 3:19:10.640]  Two girls that went to Syria to join ISIS also came out of that area.
[3:19:10.640 --> 3:19:13.360]  So are the police going to be putting surveillance on those mosques?
[3:19:13.360 --> 3:19:18.200]  Are they going to be going to those mosques and finding out if they played a role in radicalizing
[3:19:18.200 --> 3:19:19.200]  this individual?
[3:19:19.200 --> 3:19:24.000]  Well, not today, it seems like, because they're traveling around mosques, checking if the
[3:19:24.000 --> 3:19:27.760]  people in the mosques are being attacked if they're safe.
[3:19:27.760 --> 3:19:30.440]  Now, no one's advocating attacks on mosques.
[3:19:30.440 --> 3:19:31.440]  That's ridiculous.
[3:19:31.440 --> 3:19:32.720]  It's just as bad.
[3:19:32.720 --> 3:19:35.440]  You don't fight extremism with extremism.
[3:19:35.440 --> 3:19:40.960]  But for their primary concern to be, quote, hate speech, and they've come out on Twitter,
[3:19:40.960 --> 3:19:45.200]  all these different police bodies and said, we will not tolerate hate speech.
[3:19:45.200 --> 3:19:49.760]  That was their first primary concern immediately after this attack.
[3:19:49.760 --> 3:19:56.440]  It is every single time, because these councils are controlled by leftists, the same kind
[3:19:56.440 --> 3:20:02.600]  of people who ignored the ritual abuse of children for years and years in places like
[3:20:02.600 --> 3:20:03.600]  Morocco.
[3:20:03.600 --> 3:20:07.880]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected
[3:20:07.880 --> 3:20:10.280]  by you, but the symptoms are there.
[3:20:10.280 --> 3:20:15.160]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are
[3:20:15.160 --> 3:20:18.680]  just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[3:20:18.680 --> 3:20:23.200]  Here how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives
[3:20:23.200 --> 3:20:24.200]  across America.

[3:20:31.760 --> 3:20:32.760]  healthier I feel.

[3:24:18.240 --> 3:24:23.440]  So again, we have this narrative put out by the left after every single terrorist attack.
[3:24:23.440 --> 3:24:25.920]  Oh, but what about Islamophobia?
[3:24:25.920 --> 3:24:28.160]  What about people being mean to Muslims?
[3:24:28.160 --> 3:24:31.640]  That is the first thing they come out with every single time.
[3:24:31.640 --> 3:24:35.400]  They also come out with, oh, why are you blaming all Muslims?
[3:24:35.400 --> 3:24:37.280]  No one's blaming all Muslims.
[3:24:37.280 --> 3:24:41.120]  Why do they constantly insist that that's what we're saying?
[3:24:41.120 --> 3:24:42.880]  I've never said that.
[3:24:42.880 --> 3:24:46.720]  It's self-evident that that's not the case, statistically.
[3:24:46.720 --> 3:24:51.880]  But it's also self-evident, statistically, that many of these people have extreme beliefs.
[3:24:51.880 --> 3:24:53.600]  And it is a problem.
[3:24:53.600 --> 3:25:01.600]  Islam has a problem with violence, OK, when 32% say it's justifiable to commit terrorist
[3:25:01.600 --> 3:25:08.840]  attacks if it's in revenge for insulting the Prophet, 32% of British Muslims think that.
[3:25:08.840 --> 3:25:10.320]  That is a problem.
[3:25:10.320 --> 3:25:16.200]  When one in four British Muslims say the 7-7 attacks in London, which killed 50 odd people,
[3:25:16.200 --> 3:25:18.920]  are justifiable, that is a problem.
[3:25:18.920 --> 3:25:23.440]  That's something we need to have a national conversation about without leftists coming
[3:25:23.440 --> 3:25:27.520]  in immediately and saying, you're a racist, you're an Islamophobe, even though Islam is
[3:25:27.520 --> 3:25:31.640]  not a race, and that you're saying all Muslims are responsible.
[3:25:31.640 --> 3:25:33.280]  Nobody's saying that.
[3:25:33.280 --> 3:25:35.320]  Only complete idiots would claim that.
[3:25:35.320 --> 3:25:38.240]  So why do they try to create that strawman?
[3:25:38.240 --> 3:25:42.000]  Well, it's a deceptive tactic to shut down debate.
[3:25:42.000 --> 3:25:48.280]  Because again, they cannot tolerate the fact that Islam is not a progressive belief system,
[3:25:48.280 --> 3:25:53.680]  yet they still have to embrace it anyway, because it's all about the oppression Olympics.
[3:25:53.680 --> 3:25:57.960]  Now this is a tweet that was said about me about two hours ago, just to give you another
[3:25:57.960 --> 3:26:03.480]  example of the sheer idiocy that absolutely dominates Twitter after every single one of
[3:26:03.480 --> 3:26:04.480]  these incidents.
[3:26:04.480 --> 3:26:09.880]  It says, quote, I'd just like to apologize to all peaceful Muslims on behalf of white
[3:26:09.880 --> 3:26:10.880]  people.
[3:26:10.880 --> 3:26:15.280]  Paul Joseph Watson and Katie Hopkins don't represent all of us.
[3:26:15.280 --> 3:26:20.320]  So again, putting it into the context of race, Islam is not a race.
[3:26:20.320 --> 3:26:22.240]  I have to keep saying that over and over again.
[3:26:22.240 --> 3:26:25.960]  There are actually white Muslims, there are black Muslims, there are brown Muslims, that's
[3:26:25.960 --> 3:26:28.880]  because it's a frigging belief system.
[3:26:28.880 --> 3:26:30.640]  It's not a race.
[3:26:30.640 --> 3:26:33.680]  So again, they put it in the context of why you blaming all Muslims.
[3:26:33.680 --> 3:26:37.400]  Show me one instance where I blamed all Muslims for anything.
[3:26:37.400 --> 3:26:41.800]  You can't because it's a dishonest tactic to shut down a debate, a debate.
[3:26:41.800 --> 3:26:43.280]  It's not a real argument.
[3:26:43.280 --> 3:26:45.680]  It's never been part of the debate.
[3:26:45.680 --> 3:26:50.480]  What should be part of the debate is the fact that massive numbers of Muslims throughout
[3:26:50.480 --> 3:26:58.760]  the West, 42% of young Muslims in France support suicide bombing under certain circumstances.
[3:26:58.760 --> 3:26:59.760]  That's a problem.
[3:26:59.760 --> 3:27:04.320]  We have to face up to it to try and stop these massacres from happening over and over again
[3:27:04.320 --> 3:27:06.960]  because as you see with this individual.
[3:27:06.960 --> 3:27:12.760]  The guy, the suicide bomber behind the Manchester Arena attack, born in Manchester.
[3:27:12.760 --> 3:27:15.680]  This is one of the integrated ones.
[3:27:15.680 --> 3:27:19.480]  His parents were Libyan refugees who came to the UK.
[3:27:19.480 --> 3:27:21.280]  The UK gave them refuge.
[3:27:21.280 --> 3:27:23.480]  They gave us a suicide bomber.
[3:27:23.480 --> 3:27:24.720]  Gee, thanks.
[3:27:24.720 --> 3:27:29.720]  What is happening in these communities, what is happening in these prisons, in these mosques
[3:27:29.720 --> 3:27:35.800]  where people are radicalized to such a degree that they will maim and mutilate teenage girls.
[3:27:35.800 --> 3:27:43.760]  That should be the main frigging focus, not Katie Hopkins as offensive tweets.
[3:27:43.760 --> 3:27:46.520]  I mean, I've laid out this scenario before I'll lay it out again.
[3:27:46.520 --> 3:27:50.040]  Let's see how much time we got left here and we're going to get into more news going to
[3:27:50.040 --> 3:27:55.280]  get into the Libyan migrant crisis going to get into Seth Rich after the break.
[3:27:55.280 --> 3:28:01.800]  But again, here's the scenario, say five Delta Airlines planes crashed in a single day.
[3:28:01.800 --> 3:28:04.880]  In one day, five Delta Airlines planes crash.
[3:28:04.880 --> 3:28:06.440]  What would the normal reaction be?
[3:28:06.440 --> 3:28:11.080]  Well, it would be to say, damn, there's something wrong with Delta planes.
[3:28:11.080 --> 3:28:12.720]  We need to investigate this.
[3:28:12.720 --> 3:28:14.240]  We need to get to the bottom of it.
[3:28:14.240 --> 3:28:18.640]  We need to do something about it because this cannot keep happening.
[3:28:18.640 --> 3:28:19.800]  People are dying.
[3:28:19.800 --> 3:28:25.400]  That would be the normal reaction to five Delta Airlines planes crashing in a single day.
[3:28:25.400 --> 3:28:27.480]  What would be the insane reaction?
[3:28:27.480 --> 3:28:33.240]  Well, it would be to tweet, hashtag, not all Delta and say that thousands of Delta Airlines
[3:28:33.240 --> 3:28:35.600]  planes didn't crash today.
[3:28:35.600 --> 3:28:40.840]  So why are you blaming all of Delta Airlines, you Delta foe?
[3:28:40.840 --> 3:28:42.840]  That would be the insane reaction.
[3:28:42.840 --> 3:28:48.000]  The insane reaction would be to say, well, only five Delta Airlines planes crash.
[3:28:48.000 --> 3:28:49.560]  Thousands of them didn't crash.
[3:28:49.560 --> 3:28:51.880]  It's just a few bad planes.
[3:28:51.880 --> 3:28:57.280]  Maybe we should just be tolerant of Delta Airlines planes crashing and continue life
[3:28:57.280 --> 3:28:58.520]  as normal.
[3:28:58.520 --> 3:29:01.960]  Okay, that would be the insane reaction.
[3:29:01.960 --> 3:29:07.440]  We would have that reaction, but that's exactly the reaction the left has when it comes to
[3:29:07.440 --> 3:29:08.440]  terrorism.
[3:29:08.440 --> 3:29:13.960]  And it's again, because they've embodied many of the same goals as Islamic terrorists in
[3:29:13.960 --> 3:29:17.040]  terms of hating the West.
[3:29:17.040 --> 3:29:21.000]  I mean, Europe has now completely lost faith in its culture.
[3:29:21.000 --> 3:29:26.920]  The political class is flooding the continent with these people who have extreme regressive
[3:29:26.920 --> 3:29:27.920]  beliefs.
[3:29:27.920 --> 3:29:28.920]  Look, what's happening?
[3:29:28.920 --> 3:29:32.040]  And it's not just an existential threat with the terrorism.
[3:29:32.040 --> 3:29:36.040]  It's the day-to-day grind, the harassment, the abuse, the rape gangs.
[3:29:36.040 --> 3:29:38.520]  This is what Europe is currently going through.
[3:29:38.520 --> 3:29:44.080]  And it's because of what Angela Merkel, because of what Macron stands for, because of what
[3:29:44.080 --> 3:29:46.120]  the political elite stands for.
[3:29:46.120 --> 3:29:48.600]  We cannot allow it to go on.
[3:29:48.600 --> 3:29:49.600]  We'll be back after the break.
[3:29:49.600 --> 3:29:50.600]  It's the Alex Jones show live.
[3:29:50.600 --> 3:29:51.600]  Don't go away.
[3:29:51.600 --> 3:30:01.480]  The Empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:30:01.480 --> 3:30:06.080]  The Constitutional Convention 1787 was held strict secrecy, and at the end of the proceeding
[3:30:06.080 --> 3:30:10.000]  citizens gathered outside Independence Hall to learn what had been produced behind closed
[3:30:10.000 --> 3:30:11.000]  doors.
[3:30:11.000 --> 3:30:14.360]  While Benjamin Franklin was leaving the hall, a lady asked him, well, doctor, what have we
[3:30:14.360 --> 3:30:15.360]  got?
[3:30:15.360 --> 3:30:16.360]  A republic or a monarchy?
[3:30:16.360 --> 3:30:19.480]  To which he responded, a republic, if you can keep it.
[3:30:19.480 --> 3:30:23.320]  But today, not only have we lost a republic, but most people don't even know what a republic
[3:30:23.320 --> 3:30:24.320]  even is.
[3:30:24.320 --> 3:30:26.800]  For one thing, a republic is not a democracy.
[3:30:26.800 --> 3:30:30.280]  A republic operates under the rule of law, which protects individual liberties so that
[3:30:30.280 --> 3:30:33.000]  the majority cannot take away the rights of the minority.
[3:30:33.000 --> 3:30:36.600]  Under a republic, the government and its citizens all abide by the same laws, regardless of
[3:30:36.600 --> 3:30:38.960]  political power or lack thereof.
[3:30:38.960 --> 3:30:42.000]  Democracy on the other hand only leads to mob rule fueled by the unrestrained whims
[3:30:42.000 --> 3:30:43.000]  of the public.
[3:30:43.000 --> 3:30:46.760]  In a democracy, the individual or any groups of individuals composing the minority have
[3:30:46.760 --> 3:30:50.640]  no protection against the unlimited power of the majority, it is a case of majority
[3:30:50.640 --> 3:30:51.640]  over man.
[3:30:51.640 --> 3:30:55.120]  In other words, under democracy, two wolves can vote to eat the sheep for dinner.
[3:30:55.120 --> 3:30:58.480]  But under a republic, the sheep's right to life is protected by the rule of law.
[3:30:58.480 --> 3:31:00.840]  This is Kit Daniels with Denfolwors.com.
[3:31:00.840 --> 3:31:05.440]  Let's go to Devin and Florida.
[3:31:05.440 --> 3:31:07.440]  Devin and Florida, you're on the air.
[3:31:07.440 --> 3:31:08.440]  Great.
[3:31:08.440 --> 3:31:09.440]  Hey, thank you so much.
[3:31:09.440 --> 3:31:13.440]  Listen, I have bought your product and I gotta say they're amazing.
[3:31:13.440 --> 3:31:14.440]  Thank you.
[3:31:14.440 --> 3:31:19.400]  I'm gonna spend some time buying it because I've got caveman, superman of vitality, secret
[3:31:19.400 --> 3:31:21.560]  swell, vitamin and infusion.
[3:31:21.560 --> 3:31:23.120]  I've got the body armor.
[3:31:23.120 --> 3:31:24.120]  Wow, thank you.
[3:31:24.120 --> 3:31:26.400]  You're the type of listener that makes it all possible.
[3:31:26.400 --> 3:31:28.040]  Which nutraceuticals do you like best?
[3:31:28.040 --> 3:31:31.760]  I really like the vitamin mineral fusion to be honest.
[3:31:31.760 --> 3:31:32.760]  That's amazing.
[3:31:32.760 --> 3:31:33.760]  That's really incredible.
[3:31:33.760 --> 3:31:37.320]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible, like I haven't felt sweet.
[3:31:37.320 --> 3:31:43.440]  My morning was fantastic and I love the guys, I love the info, it's true and I just want
[3:31:43.440 --> 3:31:49.120]  to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence, just buy it.
[3:31:49.120 --> 3:31:50.120]  You will love it.
[3:31:50.120 --> 3:31:52.440]  I'm telling you, I've never bought a bad product.
[3:31:52.440 --> 3:31:56.840]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at infoworslif.com.
[3:31:56.840 --> 3:32:01.800]  It's a win-win infoworslif.com.
[3:32:01.800 --> 3:32:06.760]  Today we call it bone broth and for thousands of years our ancestors enjoyed its benefits
[3:32:06.760 --> 3:32:10.120]  before it became a loss to our modern diets of processed junk.
[3:32:10.120 --> 3:32:13.240]  We are now introducing caveman by infoworslif.com.
[3:32:13.240 --> 3:32:18.600]  The ultimate and true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, shaga mushroom,
[3:32:18.600 --> 3:32:23.240]  and seven total primal superfoods in a single great tasting formula.
[3:32:23.240 --> 3:32:27.320]  Caveman, it's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that
[3:32:27.320 --> 3:32:31.880]  are our superior ancestors and we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[3:32:31.880 --> 3:32:35.880]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal, you used the meat for sustenance,
[3:32:35.880 --> 3:32:41.200]  the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength from the outside structure full
[3:32:41.200 --> 3:32:45.120]  of minerals and kiko factors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body.
[3:32:45.120 --> 3:32:47.680]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[3:32:47.680 --> 3:32:52.040]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back
[3:32:52.040 --> 3:32:55.640]  to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[3:32:55.640 --> 3:32:59.160]  I know you're going to want to check out caveman ultimate paleo formula for yourself
[3:32:59.160 --> 3:33:12.480]  and forlifelif.com today.
[3:33:12.480 --> 3:33:19.160]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of
[3:33:19.160 --> 3:33:29.560]  the impoverished.
[3:33:29.560 --> 3:33:34.800]  Back live on the Alex Jones show, this is an article out of Breitbart, 2017 has seen
[3:33:34.800 --> 3:33:39.200]  a terror attack attempted in Europe every nine days.
[3:33:39.200 --> 3:33:44.720]  We talked about for years how Europe would end up like Israel, it's now slowly beginning
[3:33:44.720 --> 3:33:45.720]  to seem like it.
[3:33:45.720 --> 3:33:50.760]  In fact, it seems like it's worse right now, Europe, the United Kingdom, Russia have witnessed
[3:33:50.760 --> 3:33:54.960]  terror attacks or attempted attacks every nine days in 2017.
[3:33:54.960 --> 3:34:01.480]  On average, analysis of security incidents has revealed since January, around 45 people
[3:34:01.480 --> 3:34:05.080]  have been killed by mostly Islamic terrorists while hundreds have been injured.
[3:34:05.080 --> 3:34:10.600]  The only known incident not linked to jihadism was the attack on the Borussia Dortmund soccer
[3:34:10.600 --> 3:34:15.800]  team, attacks and attempted attacks have taken place in Austria, France, the United Kingdom,
[3:34:15.800 --> 3:34:19.720]  Belgium, Italy, Russia, Sweden, Norway and Germany.
[3:34:19.720 --> 3:34:26.680]  Just in 2017 alone, security services in Britain, which has a population of 65 million are
[3:34:26.680 --> 3:34:32.480]  known to be tracking 3500 potential terrorist suspects or persons posing a threat.
[3:34:32.480 --> 3:34:37.480]  Again, in most cases, even though they're likely to become terrorists, they have to
[3:34:37.480 --> 3:34:43.480]  leave them alone, thousands of them, thousands more flocking back in as a result of these
[3:34:43.480 --> 3:34:48.360]  ISIS controlled areas collapsing, they're coming back to Europe, they're being allowed
[3:34:48.360 --> 3:34:54.920]  back into the country, refugees welcome, the red carpet is rolled out.
[3:34:54.920 --> 3:34:59.840]  Now let's move on to the refugee crisis, of course, because it emerged that the parents
[3:34:59.840 --> 3:35:06.440]  of this suicide bomber escaped from the Gaddafi regime to come to the UK.
[3:35:06.440 --> 3:35:11.240]  Let's take a look at what's happening in Libya and why the true scale of it is being hidden
[3:35:11.240 --> 3:35:12.240]  from the public.
[3:35:12.240 --> 3:35:19.440]  Now, this is important because as we know, Gaddafi warned before he was toppled that
[3:35:19.440 --> 3:35:24.960]  jihadists would flock across the Mediterranean, would infiltrate European countries, would
[3:35:24.960 --> 3:35:27.240]  carry out terrorist attacks.
[3:35:27.240 --> 3:35:29.960]  That's exactly what is happening.
[3:35:29.960 --> 3:35:31.680]  Why is it happening?
[3:35:31.680 --> 3:35:36.280]  Because of these NGOs, because of these EU boats, these vessels that are literally giving
[3:35:36.280 --> 3:35:40.440]  migrants a taxi service straight to Europe.
[3:35:40.440 --> 3:35:46.280]  This is the biggest risk conception surrounding the migrant crisis, that these, quote, refugees
[3:35:46.280 --> 3:35:52.400]  are struggling to get close to Europe and the NGO boats are rescuing them.
[3:35:52.400 --> 3:35:54.800]  They're not rescuing them.
[3:35:54.800 --> 3:35:56.080]  This is how it works.
[3:35:56.080 --> 3:36:04.600]  The migrants pay people smugglers in Libya up to 1500 euros each, which is a year's wages,
[3:36:04.600 --> 3:36:05.600]  okay?
[3:36:05.600 --> 3:36:07.320]  They're not destitute refugees.
[3:36:07.320 --> 3:36:13.680]  80% of them, in the case of the ones going to Italy, or 85% indeed, are men.
[3:36:13.680 --> 3:36:16.000]  They're not forget Syria.
[3:36:16.000 --> 3:36:18.240]  They're not even from Libya.
[3:36:18.240 --> 3:36:23.040]  They're from other African countries, Eritrea, Nigeria.
[3:36:23.040 --> 3:36:29.840]  They're not refugees, they're economic migrants, they're paying people smugglers.
[3:36:29.840 --> 3:36:35.560]  The people smugglers transport them to a position just 12 miles off the coast of Libya, just
[3:36:35.560 --> 3:36:37.800]  12 miles.
[3:36:37.800 --> 3:36:44.480]  Then they send out a distress signal and these NGO vessels get the call, they come straight
[3:36:44.480 --> 3:36:45.480]  to them.
[3:36:45.480 --> 3:36:46.480]  They pick them up.
[3:36:46.480 --> 3:36:51.200]  Again, we presented the evidence and it's going to be in a big video that I've got coming
[3:36:51.200 --> 3:36:52.680]  out in a couple of days.
[3:36:52.680 --> 3:36:57.960]  The people smugglers are in direct contact with the aid agencies.
[3:36:57.960 --> 3:37:02.400]  Even though it's completely illegal, they're in direct phone contact with them, which is
[3:37:02.400 --> 3:37:09.440]  why they're often first on the scene to rescue these migrants, which is a criminal offense.
[3:37:09.440 --> 3:37:15.600]  To be coordinating with criminal people smugglers, that's something that they should be prosecuted
[3:37:15.600 --> 3:37:16.600]  for.
[3:37:16.600 --> 3:37:22.880]  They will be prosecuted if this investigation in Italy draws to its correct conclusion because
[3:37:22.880 --> 3:37:26.720]  that's the way it's heading at the moment, thankfully.
[3:37:26.720 --> 3:37:33.600]  We've played the videos before, you can go to marintraffic.com and see how these boats
[3:37:33.600 --> 3:37:34.920]  come from Sicily.
[3:37:34.920 --> 3:37:36.280]  They leave Sicily.
[3:37:36.280 --> 3:37:38.880]  They go to 12 miles off the coast of Libya.
[3:37:38.880 --> 3:37:42.760]  They pick up their human cargo, take it back to Italy.
[3:37:42.760 --> 3:37:45.680]  It's literally a taxi service.
[3:37:45.680 --> 3:37:53.720]  When these migrants get back to Italy having been picked up, half of them immediately disappear.
[3:37:53.720 --> 3:37:59.200]  Half of them, now you've seen the stats when it comes to certain people from Islamic countries
[3:37:59.200 --> 3:38:03.120]  supporting ISIS, huge numbers, uncomfortably huge numbers.
[3:38:03.120 --> 3:38:05.920]  Half of those people are just disappearing.
[3:38:05.920 --> 3:38:08.000]  We've seen the reports.
[3:38:08.000 --> 3:38:14.160]  Migrants arriving in Italy, eyewitness testimony, they have ISIS flags beheading videos on their
[3:38:14.160 --> 3:38:15.160]  phone.
[3:38:15.160 --> 3:38:18.200]  Okay, some of these people are jihadists.
[3:38:18.200 --> 3:38:23.680]  Some of them have been paid by ISIS to become ISIS members, to become ISIS sleeper cells
[3:38:23.680 --> 3:38:24.680]  in Europe.
[3:38:24.680 --> 3:38:31.720]  That's how many of them pay the 1,500 euro fee to the people smugglers in the first place.
[3:38:31.720 --> 3:38:38.440]  And isn't it ironic that the only time, the only time these boats are diverted from Sicily,
[3:38:38.440 --> 3:38:43.680]  having picked up migrants from Libya, is when the G7 elitists are in town.
[3:38:43.680 --> 3:38:45.560]  We had that story last week.
[3:38:45.560 --> 3:38:52.280]  So the only time they don't head back to Italy is when the very political class that created
[3:38:52.280 --> 3:38:55.600]  this disaster is in town.
[3:38:55.600 --> 3:39:01.480]  They don't want to be faced up with the consequences of the policies they created.
[3:39:01.480 --> 3:39:03.240]  Because again, it's a security threat.
[3:39:03.240 --> 3:39:07.080]  Security threat for them, forget about the Italian people.
[3:39:07.080 --> 3:39:12.680]  There's literally a war on the streets of Italy in places like Palermo and Sicily.
[3:39:12.680 --> 3:39:18.320]  Between mafias, between Italian mafias and these African migrant gangs, they're literally
[3:39:18.320 --> 3:39:20.680]  shooting each other, killing each other.
[3:39:20.680 --> 3:39:24.960]  The mayor of Palermo, in fact, I can find his comment here.
[3:39:24.960 --> 3:39:32.480]  He actually said that Palermo was now a Middle Eastern Islamic town.
[3:39:32.480 --> 3:39:34.160]  And he was happy with that.
[3:39:34.160 --> 3:39:36.520]  So a lot of them just love it.
[3:39:36.520 --> 3:39:41.360]  A lot of them just love being a turf war between migrant criminal gangs and the Italian
[3:39:41.360 --> 3:39:42.560]  mafia.
[3:39:42.560 --> 3:39:43.560]  That's what they want.
[3:39:43.560 --> 3:39:47.160]  That's what they're getting in places like Palermo.
[3:39:47.160 --> 3:39:51.480]  But again, the problem goes back to these NGO ships.
[3:39:51.480 --> 3:39:52.840]  Many of them are German.
[3:39:52.840 --> 3:39:54.360]  No surprise there.
[3:39:54.360 --> 3:40:00.800]  Even the EU border agency Frontex has accused aid agencies of helping criminals achieve
[3:40:00.800 --> 3:40:01.800]  their objectives.
[3:40:01.800 --> 3:40:05.160]  That's a direct quote.
[3:40:05.160 --> 3:40:10.160]  The people smugglers contact the NGO boats because they know they won't be arrested if
[3:40:10.160 --> 3:40:14.360]  they contacted Coast Guard boats, they've got a risk of being arrested, so they don't
[3:40:14.360 --> 3:40:15.360]  do that.
[3:40:15.360 --> 3:40:16.960]  Here's a quote.
[3:40:16.960 --> 3:40:23.120]  Since June 2016, many boats have been rescued near the Libyan coast by aid agency vessels
[3:40:23.120 --> 3:40:30.400]  without any prior distress call suggesting the rendezvous has been prearranged.
[3:40:30.400 --> 3:40:35.400]  So again, they're in direct contact with the criminal people smugglers.
[3:40:35.400 --> 3:40:41.400]  During prosecutor, Carmelo Zacara says he has evidence of phone calls between criminal
[3:40:41.400 --> 3:40:51.440]  people smugglers and NGOs like Save the Children, Proactiva Open Arms and SOS Mediterranean.
[3:40:51.440 --> 3:40:56.240]  Also Avaz.org, Medicine Sand Frontier and MoveOn.org are all involved.
[3:40:56.240 --> 3:41:04.680]  You'll notice those are all George Soros bankrolled organizations, 500 million he invested not
[3:41:04.680 --> 3:41:12.240]  long ago to quote help refugees and undoubtedly much of it is going to these NGOs to chart
[3:41:12.240 --> 3:41:20.640]  these vessels that go out, bring these unvetted in some cases, ISIS members or ISIS sympathizers
[3:41:20.640 --> 3:41:21.760]  into Europe.
[3:41:21.760 --> 3:41:25.680]  So again, it's an absolutely huge scandal.
[3:41:25.680 --> 3:41:27.160]  Nobody knows the scale of it.
[3:41:27.160 --> 3:41:34.280]  We're talking 200,000 migrants have arrived in Italy last year alone and that's increasing
[3:41:34.280 --> 3:41:43.120]  200,000 a year, unvetted, just brought straight in half of them immediately disappear.
[3:41:43.120 --> 3:41:48.560]  Just 2.65% of migrants arriving in Italy are awarded asylum status.
[3:41:48.560 --> 3:41:54.800]  So again, the huge misconception that they're all refugees, they're not refugees, the vast
[3:41:54.800 --> 3:42:01.120]  majority of them are men and half of them at least just immediately disappear as soon
[3:42:01.120 --> 3:42:04.440]  as they arrive in Europe.
[3:42:04.440 --> 3:42:07.480]  Now people say, well, is the migrant crisis going to end up as they're just going to
[3:42:07.480 --> 3:42:13.600]  be just so many people coming in that it stops being a deluge and just becomes a trickle.
[3:42:13.600 --> 3:42:18.840]  Well, no, because Africa's population is exploding again, where are these people coming from?
[3:42:18.840 --> 3:42:19.840]  They're not Libyans.
[3:42:19.840 --> 3:42:23.960]  Okay, they're coming from Niger, they're coming from Chad, they're coming from Sudan,
[3:42:23.960 --> 3:42:26.360]  they're coming from Ethiopia.
[3:42:26.360 --> 3:42:30.680]  You look at the projected populations of those countries in Africa.
[3:42:30.680 --> 3:42:34.040]  Niger's population is exploding.
[3:42:34.040 --> 3:42:36.240]  These are the countries surrounding Libya.
[3:42:36.240 --> 3:42:43.280]  Niger's population is set to quadruple in the next three decades, 20 million to 72 million.
[3:42:43.280 --> 3:42:48.280]  Chad's population is going to leap from 14 million to 35 million.
[3:42:48.280 --> 3:42:57.480]  Sudan is heading towards 80 million, Egypt, 152 million, Ethiopia, 189 million and Nigeria,
[3:42:57.480 --> 3:43:00.240]  400 million.
[3:43:00.240 --> 3:43:02.280]  So it's never going to stop.
[3:43:02.280 --> 3:43:08.480]  If we have this policy of just picking them up, bringing them in on taxis, it's never
[3:43:08.480 --> 3:43:10.480]  going to stop.
[3:43:10.480 --> 3:43:11.480]  And this is the problem.
[3:43:11.480 --> 3:43:16.440]  You can't flood European cities with tens of millions of people from the Middle East
[3:43:16.440 --> 3:43:19.520]  and Africa and expect it to remain the same.
[3:43:19.520 --> 3:43:24.320]  Eventually, it's going to start to feel less like Europe and more like the Middle East
[3:43:24.320 --> 3:43:26.760]  and Africa, okay?
[3:43:26.760 --> 3:43:31.200]  If you took hundreds of millions of white people and dumped them into China, that's
[3:43:31.200 --> 3:43:33.400]  going to change their society.
[3:43:33.400 --> 3:43:38.200]  It's just basic demographics, basic culture.
[3:43:38.200 --> 3:43:42.320]  So again, Southern Italy is going through absolute nightmares of having turf wars between
[3:43:42.320 --> 3:43:47.000]  the Italian mafia and these African crime gangs that have arrived.
[3:43:47.000 --> 3:43:51.080]  This is the quote from the mayor of Palermo that I alluded to earlier.
[3:43:51.080 --> 3:43:54.120]  He said, quote, Palermo is no longer an Italian town.
[3:43:54.120 --> 3:43:55.880]  It's no longer European.
[3:43:55.880 --> 3:43:59.920]  You can walk in the city and feel like you're in Istanbul or Beirut.
[3:43:59.920 --> 3:44:04.520]  Palermo is a Middle Eastern town in Europe.
[3:44:04.520 --> 3:44:06.800]  That's the mayor of Palermo.
[3:44:06.800 --> 3:44:08.200]  He's happy about it.
[3:44:08.200 --> 3:44:10.680]  He said it was a good thing.
[3:44:10.680 --> 3:44:16.200]  Similar to how the Green Party member in Germany said that, you know, major German cities being
[3:44:16.200 --> 3:44:19.520]  a white minority in 20 years would be a great thing.
[3:44:19.520 --> 3:44:20.640]  They celebrated it.
[3:44:20.640 --> 3:44:23.320]  This is what they're all about.
[3:44:23.320 --> 3:44:28.140]  Because again, they ship in a class of people that are totally dependent on handouts.
[3:44:28.140 --> 3:44:29.640]  That keeps them in power.
[3:44:29.640 --> 3:44:31.400]  That's all they care about.
[3:44:31.400 --> 3:44:33.320]  They want to be in power forever.
[3:44:33.320 --> 3:44:34.960]  This is how they think they're going to do it.
[3:44:34.960 --> 3:44:43.400]  By destroying their own culture, by committing suicide, absolutely incredible.
[3:44:43.400 --> 3:44:45.720]  And it's not just the terror attacks.
[3:44:45.720 --> 3:44:49.080]  People make the argument, well, you know, how many people die of cancer?
[3:44:49.080 --> 3:44:51.320]  How many people die in road accidents?
[3:44:51.320 --> 3:44:54.560]  It's not just the existential threat.
[3:44:54.560 --> 3:44:59.360]  There was a report out of Sweden the other day, which we covered, 90% of shootings in
[3:44:59.360 --> 3:45:07.000]  Sweden using firearms are carried out by migrants, 90%, not 1990.
[3:45:07.000 --> 3:45:08.720]  You can look at Germany.
[3:45:08.720 --> 3:45:16.320]  Their own government interior ministry report found that there were an extra 402,000 crimes
[3:45:16.320 --> 3:45:24.240]  committed by migrants per year with non-Germans accounting for 27.6% of total offences.
[3:45:24.240 --> 3:45:28.360]  So they're completely overrepresented in the crime statistics.
[3:45:28.360 --> 3:45:31.280]  You talk about that in Sweden, they put you on a hate list.
[3:45:31.280 --> 3:45:34.400]  You see how this begins to work.
[3:45:34.400 --> 3:45:37.120]  Half a million migrants in Germany are on welfare benefits.
[3:45:37.120 --> 3:45:42.720]  The idea that we need them to save our economy, to import workers because we're committing
[3:45:42.720 --> 3:45:46.800]  demographic suicide doesn't stand up.
[3:45:46.800 --> 3:45:47.800]  Most of them are on benefits.
[3:45:47.800 --> 3:45:49.240]  They don't have jobs.
[3:45:49.240 --> 3:45:50.360]  They bleed the economy.
[3:45:50.360 --> 3:45:53.240]  They don't add to the economy.
[3:45:53.240 --> 3:45:54.240]  We have the gang raids.
[3:45:54.240 --> 3:45:55.240]  We have the harassment.
[3:45:55.240 --> 3:45:56.760]  We have the abuse of women.
[3:45:56.760 --> 3:46:04.480]  You now have women in Paris protesting Eastern Paris because they can't leave the house
[3:46:04.480 --> 3:46:10.600]  dressed in certain clothing without being abused and harassed by gangs of migrant men.
[3:46:10.600 --> 3:46:11.800]  We've seen the rapes.
[3:46:11.800 --> 3:46:12.800]  We've seen the gang rapes.
[3:46:12.800 --> 3:46:17.920]  We had a gang rape in Austria reported just a few days ago.
[3:46:17.920 --> 3:46:24.600]  Weekly, at least bi-weekly, we have a gang rape in some small, clean European town because
[3:46:24.600 --> 3:46:29.160]  of this culture that we've imported.
[3:46:29.160 --> 3:46:34.480]  In Germany and Italy, they're confiscating private property to house these migrants.
[3:46:34.480 --> 3:46:39.120]  In Sweden, the big postal company Post Nord announced it would stop mail delivery to the
[3:46:39.120 --> 3:46:43.920]  migrant suburb of Rinkeby because it's too unsafe.
[3:46:43.920 --> 3:46:44.920]  Social media.
[3:46:44.920 --> 3:46:48.840]  Again, if you complain about this, though, you're bad.
[3:46:48.840 --> 3:46:49.840]  Don't fix the problem.
[3:46:49.840 --> 3:46:52.360]  Complain about the people who are complaining about it.
[3:46:52.360 --> 3:46:55.160]  Put them on a hate crime blacklist.
[3:46:55.160 --> 3:46:59.120]  That's what Angela Merkel's main concern was, wasn't it, when she talked to Zuckerberg?
[3:46:59.120 --> 3:47:03.640]  How can we stop people criticizing this policy?
[3:47:03.640 --> 3:47:09.360]  So again, these NGOs that are picking up, it's a virtual taxi service.
[3:47:09.360 --> 3:47:14.080]  They're picking them up from the coast of Libya, dumping them into Italy, half go missing.
[3:47:14.080 --> 3:47:16.120]  We need to put a stop to this.
[3:47:16.120 --> 3:47:18.600]  These NGOs need to be prosecuted.
[3:47:18.600 --> 3:47:25.040]  They are currently being investigated by Italian authorities, and hopefully that prosecution
[3:47:25.040 --> 3:47:26.800]  will come through.
[3:47:26.800 --> 3:47:32.280]  The other positive development in actually stopping this is that Beppe Grillo's five-star
[3:47:32.280 --> 3:47:38.400]  movement, which is a populist party in Italy, according to recent polls, is either tied
[3:47:38.400 --> 3:47:42.920]  or has a slender lead over the ruling center-left party in Italy.
[3:47:42.920 --> 3:47:45.680]  Again, this is not just about Italy.
[3:47:45.680 --> 3:47:48.520]  This is where the migrants are coming in.
[3:47:48.520 --> 3:47:51.200]  This is the major route now.
[3:47:51.200 --> 3:47:56.240]  If we stop this, if we plug this leak, we can actually prevent terror attacks.
[3:47:56.240 --> 3:48:01.600]  This has bragged about how they're exploiting this to infiltrate fighters into Europe.
[3:48:01.600 --> 3:48:07.160]  Stop Beppe Grillo's five-star movement in Italy like nothing before, because they have a chance
[3:48:07.160 --> 3:48:10.600]  of being elected next year in the Italian election.
[3:48:10.600 --> 3:48:16.680]  They have promised to stop these NGO boats picking up these migrants, dumping them into
[3:48:16.680 --> 3:48:17.680]  Italy.
[3:48:17.680 --> 3:48:21.440]  That's one of their campaigns, Beppe Grillo's five-star movement.
[3:48:21.440 --> 3:48:23.800]  Again, it's not a far-right party.
[3:48:23.800 --> 3:48:25.400]  It's a populist party.
[3:48:25.400 --> 3:48:28.040]  It's doing extremely well in the polls.
[3:48:28.040 --> 3:48:36.540]  And they have a chance of stopping this nightmare that is being inflicted upon Europe, another
[3:48:36.540 --> 3:48:39.880]  expression of which we saw last night in Manchester.
[3:48:39.880 --> 3:48:41.560]  But again, it's not just about migrants.
[3:48:41.560 --> 3:48:42.960]  It's not just about refugees.
[3:48:42.960 --> 3:48:48.760]  It's about these ghettoized areas, people going to mosques, people going to prisons.
[3:48:48.760 --> 3:48:55.400]  The radicalization problem in prisons is absolutely endemic.
[3:48:55.400 --> 3:48:58.680]  But again, because of political correctness, there's nothing done about it.
[3:48:58.680 --> 3:49:01.920]  There's absolutely nothing done about it at every turn.
[3:49:01.920 --> 3:49:04.000]  These are the solutions that we need to focus on.
[3:49:04.000 --> 3:49:08.480]  I mentioned some of them in my video, which you heard earlier.
[3:49:08.480 --> 3:49:12.800]  So none of the debate is about all Muslims are responsible.
[3:49:12.800 --> 3:49:15.560]  The debate is, this is terrible.
[3:49:15.560 --> 3:49:19.760]  We cannot let this become the new normal like the media wants us to do.
[3:49:19.760 --> 3:49:21.320]  We have to address this.
[3:49:21.320 --> 3:49:28.320]  We have to propose concrete solutions to prevent this from happening every nine days
[3:49:28.320 --> 3:49:29.320]  now in Europe.
[3:49:29.320 --> 3:49:32.080]  There's a terror attack.
[3:49:32.080 --> 3:49:38.360]  So the solution is not to shut down people who are actually proposing remedies.
[3:49:38.360 --> 3:49:39.920]  That's not the solution.
[3:49:39.920 --> 3:49:45.120]  But that's what this political class is pushing, because again, they're beholden to this policy.
[3:49:45.120 --> 3:49:49.280]  They created it for their own political machinations.
[3:49:49.280 --> 3:49:51.100]  Now they're wedded to it.
[3:49:51.100 --> 3:49:58.680]  So they have to demonize anybody who tries to stop that policy as Islamophobic, as racist.
[3:49:58.680 --> 3:50:03.680]  But we should not allow this to continue as normal.
[3:50:03.680 --> 3:50:04.680]  Another report here.
[3:50:04.680 --> 3:50:09.400]  ISIS claims responsibility for Manchester attacks suspect bomber identified again.
[3:50:09.400 --> 3:50:11.120]  His parents were Libyan refugees.
[3:50:11.120 --> 3:50:12.840]  The UK gave them sanctuary.
[3:50:12.840 --> 3:50:14.520]  They gave us a suicide bomber.
[3:50:14.520 --> 3:50:15.520]  Gee, thanks.
[3:50:15.520 --> 3:50:18.120]  What is happening in these communities?
[3:50:18.120 --> 3:50:22.960]  They've carried out controlled explosions in Wally Range, an area of Manchester, which
[3:50:22.960 --> 3:50:26.880]  again has four mosques in one area alone.
[3:50:26.880 --> 3:50:29.800]  It's not that big an area.
[3:50:29.800 --> 3:50:30.800]  Four mosques.
[3:50:30.800 --> 3:50:32.360]  What's happening inside these mosques?
[3:50:32.360 --> 3:50:33.880]  Did he attend the mosques?
[3:50:33.880 --> 3:50:35.240]  Was he radicalized?
[3:50:35.240 --> 3:50:40.280]  We know that he was known to security services, and that's the case in almost every single
[3:50:40.280 --> 3:50:43.760]  case because they're told, oh, you can only track them.
[3:50:43.760 --> 3:50:49.120]  You can't actually apprehend them, even though they're radicalized, they're terrorists, they're
[3:50:49.120 --> 3:50:51.120]  likely to commit terrorist attacks.
[3:50:51.120 --> 3:50:52.880]  This is the situation in Europe.
[3:50:52.880 --> 3:50:54.840]  It's absolutely horrific.
[3:50:54.840 --> 3:50:58.520]  Something must change beyond virtue signaling and hashtags.
[3:50:58.520 --> 3:51:00.520]  We'll be back on The Irish Gem Show Live.
[3:51:00.520 --> 3:51:01.520]  Don't go away.
[3:51:01.520 --> 3:51:04.320]  This is Elizabeth McCabe, aka Lucky One of Truth Frequency News.
[3:51:04.320 --> 3:51:07.200]  I wanted to tell you all about Extendivite from heartdrop.com.
[3:51:07.200 --> 3:51:09.800]  Y'all know I check everything before I air it.
[3:51:09.800 --> 3:51:14.200]  When I heard about Extendivite on TFR, I went to heartdrop.com and started my research.
[3:51:14.200 --> 3:51:15.200]  It's got cayenne.
[3:51:15.200 --> 3:51:16.760]  That's good for blood and circulation.
[3:51:16.760 --> 3:51:18.240]  It stimulates the blood flow.
[3:51:18.240 --> 3:51:22.400]  It's got garlic, which fights bacteria like antibiotics, and it lowers the cholesterol
[3:51:22.400 --> 3:51:23.400]  and blood pressure.
[3:51:23.400 --> 3:51:26.160]  It also has milk thistle, which is the best he talks for liver.
[3:51:26.160 --> 3:51:29.200]  I couldn't wait to try it out, and I'm glad I did four months ago.
[3:51:29.200 --> 3:51:30.680]  And here's the obvious results.
[3:51:30.680 --> 3:51:32.360]  My hands and feet don't get cold anymore.
[3:51:32.360 --> 3:51:34.600]  The varicose veins have faded too.
[3:51:34.600 --> 3:51:36.640]  My wrists don't hurt after typing all day.

[3:56:35.040 --> 3:56:40.280]  a private investigator come out and claim that from his sources he knew that Seth Rich
[3:56:40.280 --> 3:56:45.800]  was the source of the DNC leaks that got poo pooed there was a pushback against that
[3:56:45.800 --> 3:56:50.600]  was he threatened we don't know now Kim.com who of course was the founder of mega upload
[3:56:50.600 --> 3:56:56.760]  teased this yesterday by coming out and saying that he knew for a fact that Seth Rich not
[3:56:56.760 --> 3:57:03.760]  Russia Seth Rich the murdered DNC staffer was the source of the DNC leak now he's released
[3:57:03.760 --> 3:57:09.880]  a statement on his website saying quote I know this because in late 2014 a person contacted
[3:57:09.880 --> 3:57:14.320]  me about helping me to start a branch of the internet party in the United States he called
[3:57:14.320 --> 3:57:21.360]  himself Panda I now know that Panda was Seth Rich of course that's the icon that's the
[3:57:21.360 --> 3:57:26.040]  avatar that he used on his different accounts he continues Panda advised me that he was working
[3:57:26.040 --> 3:57:31.680]  on voter analytics tools and other technologies that the internet party may find helpful.
[3:57:31.680 --> 3:57:37.000]  So he was disenfranchised because Bernie Sanders who he supported was screwed over that was
[3:57:37.000 --> 3:57:44.040]  his motivation he was in contact with Kim Kim.com now Kim.com continues in this statement
[3:57:44.040 --> 3:57:48.360]  I've consulted with my lawyers except my full statement should be provided to the authorities
[3:57:48.360 --> 3:57:53.160]  so he says is prepared to do that if my evidence is required to be given in the US I would
[3:57:53.160 --> 3:57:58.200]  be prepared to do so if appropriate arrangements are made I would need a guarantee from special
[3:57:58.200 --> 3:58:03.240]  counsel Muller on behalf of the United States safe passage given that he's his house has
[3:58:03.240 --> 3:58:07.480]  been raided before from New Zealand to the United States and back so now he's saying
[3:58:07.480 --> 3:58:14.880]  he will give that evidence of Seth Rich being the source of the DNC leaks to a special prosecution
