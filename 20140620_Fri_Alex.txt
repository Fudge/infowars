[00:00.000 --> 00:12.720]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.720 --> 00:32.400]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:32.400 --> 00:39.880]  well President Obama has come out and said that you can come here illegally but
[00:39.880 --> 00:44.240]  he's gonna deport you of course you can pull up different numbers the last six
[00:44.240 --> 00:49.960]  years deportations were first cut by half then 60% I've seen numbers as high
[00:49.960 --> 00:58.200]  as 80% ladies and gentlemen 80% plus of the people being held are not being
[00:58.200 --> 01:05.360]  deported including tens of thousands of felons and aggravated felons just in
[01:05.360 --> 01:13.960]  the last month and that's all on record so drugs report earlier had the image of
[01:13.960 --> 01:26.840]  Obama winking winking when he said that here's the issue this is to set the
[01:26.840 --> 01:32.000]  precedent to create a border crisis to use that crisis as a pretext to say the
[01:32.000 --> 01:38.600]  answer is immigration reform to give people a legal pathway into the country
[01:38.600 --> 01:45.400]  folks in the third world know that they can just walk across the border and be
[01:45.400 --> 01:49.780]  unmolested and go all the way up to the interior to join their illegal
[01:49.780 --> 01:53.440]  families and now the border patrol and we broke this story and it's now
[01:53.440 --> 02:01.200]  national news he is taking them and giving them vouchers and tickets on
[02:01.200 --> 02:05.760]  Greyhound to go wherever they say they have family that is so off the charts
[02:05.760 --> 02:10.760]  that last night I was just thinking about it laying in bed and I just thought
[02:10.760 --> 02:18.760]  to myself that is so unreal that it's a felony if you or I do that it's human
[02:18.760 --> 02:25.240]  trafficking it's coyote but when the government does it while acting like
[02:25.240 --> 02:30.360]  they're not and listen it was so easy to prove we just sent three reporters and a
[02:30.360 --> 02:35.240]  cameraman down to the border for four or five days a Sunday through Wednesday
[02:35.240 --> 02:41.120]  or no they came back Wednesday nights of Sunday through Wednesday and broke
[02:41.120 --> 02:49.720]  probably three national news stories last week we it was picked up by Fox and
[02:49.720 --> 02:56.680]  others about the Air Force base in San Antonio full of illegals and we drew
[02:56.680 --> 03:02.160]  attention to that and I'm not tooting our horn again almost anybody can do this
[03:02.160 --> 03:08.560]  now the mainstream media is losing their viewers and their market share because
[03:08.560 --> 03:13.880]  they won't do their job and nature abhors the vacuum it's going to go
[03:13.880 --> 03:19.720]  wherever people give a big open unfiltered view like president planet
[03:19.720 --> 03:25.400]  calm and full wars calm drudge report calm sites like that it doesn't mean I
[03:25.400 --> 03:28.120]  have all the answers or one of my reporters has all the answers we're
[03:28.120 --> 03:32.600]  people to we make mistakes but we're trying to tell the truth and we have an
[03:32.600 --> 03:37.360]  open bias towards liberty and telling the truth I mean I'm really more and more
[03:37.360 --> 03:42.040]  just want to be a good person and I've always wanted to be a good person but
[03:42.040 --> 03:52.240]  now I just absolutely more and more and committed to trying to be a good person
[03:52.240 --> 03:56.200]  and that means not being a mean person it means not being a super aggressive
[03:56.200 --> 04:01.360]  person it means not being a person that gets angry all the time and it didn't
[04:01.360 --> 04:04.320]  mean I still won't get angry sometime people tune in to see that I'm told or
[04:04.320 --> 04:08.840]  hear that it's just that we all have to have a gut check right now and decide
[04:08.840 --> 04:13.640]  which side of history we're gonna be on and not just have some window dressing
[04:13.640 --> 04:17.320]  in our own minds that we're good men or women we've got a really stand up now
[04:17.320 --> 04:23.560]  and everybody knows what to do out there he's another cheesy line from
[04:23.560 --> 04:28.000]  revenge of the fifth cuz I watched that last weekend with my children after not
[04:28.000 --> 04:32.560]  seeing it in years and they've gone to the Jedi temple where everybody's been
[04:32.560 --> 04:37.640]  killed by Darth Vader and we go to tells Obi-Wan Kenobi go find Vader and
[04:37.640 --> 04:41.880]  kill him he says you know I don't know where to start he goes you know you'll
[04:41.880 --> 04:48.000]  figure out where to go and what to do and it's the same thing for all of us we
[04:48.000 --> 04:52.800]  all know ways to change things every day and when you seem to do it and stop
[04:52.800 --> 04:57.120]  making excuses I'll be right back

[08:29.600 --> 08:38.640]  Bob Barr the former congressman who looks like he said to get back into
[08:38.640 --> 08:46.880]  Congress kind of a proto or trailblazing pre tea party individual who
[08:46.880 --> 08:51.160]  exposed a lot of tyranny is going to be talking about the VA scandal we're
[08:51.160 --> 08:56.540]  supposed to forget about the border scandal the Iraq situation and so much
[08:56.540 --> 09:03.640]  more and again thank you for joining us I will be live this Sunday as well and
[09:03.640 --> 09:11.040]  that is 4 to 6 p.m. central standard time from this studio and I intend to send
[09:11.040 --> 09:17.400]  reporters back down finding out who wants to go right now back down to the
[09:17.400 --> 09:24.240]  border this Sunday to be live on the air with us from the border where the head
[09:24.240 --> 09:32.880]  of homeland security J. Johnson or J Johnson has now basically visited and
[09:32.880 --> 09:36.280]  we're trying to find his itinerary looks like he should be down here engaged in
[09:36.280 --> 09:40.240]  photo ops for a couple days we're gonna try to go these press conferences and
[09:40.240 --> 09:44.960]  ask him or any other so-called feds who aren't doing their job to control the
[09:44.960 --> 09:48.480]  border that's in the Constitution or the three things the feds are supposed to
[09:48.480 --> 09:54.200]  do we're going to go down there and basically ask the question we have the
[09:54.200 --> 09:59.520]  emergency manager of McAllen Texas on record saying that 90 plus percent of
[09:59.520 --> 10:03.080]  the illegals that get off border patrol buses that they've been picked up at the
[10:03.080 --> 10:13.280]  border are given tickets to go into the interior of the United States people who
[10:13.280 --> 10:20.080]  are illegal and those articles have gone viral via info wars dot com prison
[10:20.080 --> 10:24.360]  planet dot com drudge report dot com the Daily Mail's picked up on it world
[10:24.360 --> 10:27.920]  that daily's picked up on it and shown photos and videos of trains coming up
[10:27.920 --> 10:32.880]  to the border with literally thousands of people sitting on top of them we're
[10:32.880 --> 10:40.720]  talking 50 people per car or so sitting on top of the cars I mean this is
[10:40.720 --> 10:46.080]  incredible and and Obama because he doesn't want to get the blame because
[10:46.080 --> 10:49.240]  we're putting the blame on him see if we had just sat back and said we wonder
[10:49.240 --> 10:53.680]  why there's a flood well he stopped most deportations even of aggravated felons
[10:53.680 --> 11:00.280]  that means a violent felon a homicidal felon an assaulting felon a raping felon
[11:00.280 --> 11:04.720]  an arsonist felon aggravated means it could kill somebody or they did kill
[11:04.720 --> 11:11.640]  somebody aggravated you assault somebody with your fist unless you're a known
[11:11.640 --> 11:16.360]  boxer that can kill people and has killed people before in almost every court
[11:16.360 --> 11:19.200]  case you you know you're not going to get charged with an aggravated felony
[11:19.200 --> 11:23.000]  because you can say you didn't try to kill them premeditatedly but you start
[11:23.000 --> 11:28.160]  trying to beat somebody over the head with a tire iron with a crowbar the
[11:28.160 --> 11:31.360]  jury is going to believe he reasonably knew that that could kill somebody and
[11:31.360 --> 11:37.560]  these are aggravated felons child molesters all nine yards who are fleeing
[11:37.560 --> 11:43.120]  justice in collapsing Latin America and so we pointed this out last week and
[11:43.120 --> 11:49.360]  this week many times I said it's a political process and if we point out
[11:49.360 --> 11:54.680]  it's on purpose and if we can prove that which it obviously is as congress
[11:54.680 --> 12:01.800]  people and senators are now saying and Joe Arpaio is saying in Arizona on the
[12:01.800 --> 12:05.560]  front line of this we're stating the obvious but the public doesn't know the
[12:05.560 --> 12:11.320]  obvious and state-run media and people like Harry Reid and Obama they don't
[12:11.320 --> 12:15.680]  want the public to know this so we just keep stating the obvious here you keep
[12:15.680 --> 12:21.440]  stating the obvious yourself and then as this all unfolds Obama's not going to
[12:21.440 --> 12:26.600]  be able to just get the first new waves in to encourage a mass wave that makes
[12:26.600 --> 12:30.720]  this huge wave look tame in comparison we're saying 10 20 times bigger there
[12:30.720 --> 12:35.200]  could be 30 times bigger because there's a depression across the Caribbean in
[12:35.200 --> 12:38.200]  Latin America and many other parts of the world you think it's bad here it's
[12:38.200 --> 12:42.600]  nothing look up Caribbean crime rates have more than doubled the last five
[12:42.600 --> 12:47.160]  years I know because occasionally I go to the Caribbean with my family and I
[12:47.160 --> 12:51.040]  look up crime rates and I've gone to places that were nice 10 years ago that
[12:51.040 --> 12:57.720]  are scary now I love Mexico folks I won't go there now because the people have a
[12:57.720 --> 13:02.440]  bad attitude they're angry they blame America and El Norte and the gringo on
[13:02.440 --> 13:08.120]  average and they've had their jobs taken whether they're fishermen or they're
[13:08.120 --> 13:11.280]  factory workers and they're angry and they and they're angry at everybody they
[13:11.280 --> 13:16.200]  have riots every day in Mexico folks with tanks and troops on a monthly basis
[13:16.200 --> 13:20.320]  shooting people for the point it's not even in our news anymore so I don't want
[13:20.320 --> 13:26.680]  to go to a collapsing war zone well that war zone is coming here with the mass
[13:26.680 --> 13:31.760]  graves being dug up and all the rest of it so Obama's coming out wink wink now
[13:31.760 --> 13:35.640]  and saying he knows you know nothing about this and you can come here but
[13:35.640 --> 13:40.160]  you're going to be turned back and sent back well that's not true the board of
[13:40.160 --> 13:44.040]  patrol who on average are one of the better federal agencies because they're
[13:44.040 --> 13:48.200]  constitutional and I just have looked at them they got a lot of problems but
[13:48.200 --> 13:56.040]  compared to the ATF they're literal angels and the the the board of patrol
[13:56.040 --> 13:59.680]  has been calling for help they're quitting they've sent us letters and
[13:59.680 --> 14:03.120]  documented who they are they've blown the whistle to us eyes people have they're
[14:03.120 --> 14:06.360]  the most freaked out because they're watching MS-13 bore across they're
[14:06.360 --> 14:12.000]  watching police get shot citizens get robbed houses getting burned down they
[14:12.000 --> 14:20.440]  are watching extremely arrogant garbage as all of this unfolds and a lot of the
[14:20.440 --> 14:24.440]  hard-working Latin American immigrants that have come here legally or even came
[14:24.440 --> 14:28.680]  here illegally in the past but didn't get free welfare they're upset about what's
[14:28.680 --> 14:38.400]  going on as well because they recognize the dregs the dregs let me tell you
[14:38.400 --> 14:45.720]  what a drag is the drag is a criminal the dregs are people that don't have any
[14:45.720 --> 14:50.200]  skills and have diseases boy do I feel sorry for him but we're collapsing you
[14:50.200 --> 14:54.600]  don't collapse this lifeboat and sink this lifeboat that's right of jack up
[14:54.600 --> 14:58.800]  Mexico see that's why I was against the killing of Gaddafi and putting an
[14:58.800 --> 15:02.360]  al-Qaeda to make it ten times worse on record now to admit it's total hellhole
[15:02.360 --> 15:10.280]  because Gaddafi was probably a bad guy 35 years ago when he took power but he
[15:10.280 --> 15:15.280]  did spend about 98% of the money that he controlled only time socialism works is
[15:15.280 --> 15:22.480]  if you do have a beneficent dictator in an already hellish anarchy area who
[15:22.480 --> 15:27.160]  builds public works and actually gives the general public jobs and builds
[15:27.160 --> 15:33.000]  colleges and Gaddafi lived in a tent most the time and if you saw a so-called
[15:33.000 --> 15:37.480]  armored palace for his quote safety it was a 15-foot wall and what looks like
[15:37.480 --> 15:42.600]  a swimming pool that wouldn't be that fancy in Westlake Austin and I'm not
[15:42.600 --> 15:47.440]  lionizing him or glorifying him he got totally delusional sort of meeting with
[15:47.440 --> 15:53.560]  Obama six years ago meeting with Sarkozy last day six years before he was
[15:53.560 --> 15:56.800]  killed about nine years ago now and he started investing their money in
[15:56.800 --> 16:01.520]  Goldman Sachs and sort of going to meetings in Europe and actually believe
[16:01.520 --> 16:05.440]  because he was able to meet with Davos people and Bilderberg people that that he
[16:05.440 --> 16:09.760]  was working with the West he gave up all his weapons his high-tech weapons
[16:09.760 --> 16:17.560]  nerve gas you name it and you saw what happened to him and Gaddafi was literally
[16:17.560 --> 16:27.240]  jacking up out of the mud 80% of Africa he was building that continent up and
[16:27.240 --> 16:34.080]  literally for whatever reason was taking not just the money from in Libya but he
[16:34.080 --> 16:40.120]  was doing true development all over Africa and he was trying to form an African
[16:40.120 --> 16:43.680]  Union not run by the globalist they're trying to set that up to to have one
[16:43.680 --> 16:47.400]  enslavement system he was setting up a real African Union where the countries
[16:47.400 --> 16:52.680]  really voted they really elected people and they really came together and man
[16:52.680 --> 16:56.560]  Africa is a beautiful country I would love I get chills when I talk about this
[16:56.560 --> 17:01.480]  I believe in humanity I want to empower humanity I want to see Africa that's a
[17:01.480 --> 17:08.640]  jewel with the resources and and the beauty and the people but corruption has
[17:08.640 --> 17:13.000]  been in control of Africa forever they never got out of it everywhere else was
[17:13.000 --> 17:17.720]  under corruption the exact same executions torture slavery barbarism went on in
[17:17.720 --> 17:24.600]  Mesoamerica went on in Europe went on in Asia went on everywhere until the
[17:24.600 --> 17:30.520]  Renaissance ladies and gentlemen and until the ideas of Christendom merged
[17:30.520 --> 17:34.040]  with the Renaissance because Christendom had its own dark age and its own
[17:34.040 --> 17:40.840]  problems and out of that came what we see as Western civilization that is in
[17:40.840 --> 17:44.960]  total retreat and decline right now being replaced by the technocracy
[17:44.960 --> 17:51.320]  eugenicist scientific dictatorship system that I stand firmly against but
[17:51.320 --> 17:57.400]  also at a fundamental gut organic level you can call it a spiritual level
[17:57.400 --> 18:02.440]  realize that if I have a greedy thought to suppress someone at my
[18:02.440 --> 18:09.880]  advancement an evil thought that it will only come back on society and on
[18:09.880 --> 18:15.040]  myself I call that God fearing it's an instinct that you reap what you so it's
[18:15.040 --> 18:20.200]  a fact of the universe it's a law even if you don't believe in spiritual forces
[18:20.200 --> 18:30.400]  it's real and so just because they've set up a system where the minority groups
[18:30.400 --> 18:34.640]  are hyped and ready for tribalism and racism doesn't mean that I have to buy
[18:34.640 --> 18:38.360]  into that and hate them it doesn't mean though that I don't put up defenses and
[18:38.360 --> 18:43.120]  speak directly to people and say look here's how the game works and it doesn't
[18:43.120 --> 18:47.280]  mean a group of clansmen trying to kill some old black man walking down the road

[25:12.320 --> 25:17.560]  hear your take if you are predisposed about Obama saying you know what you
[25:17.560 --> 25:21.280]  don't send your kids up here as you can send them but we're going to deport them
[25:21.280 --> 25:25.000]  when it's on record they've almost ended all the deportations even of
[25:25.000 --> 25:28.560]  aggravated felons and we've got video we're gonna play it in a moment again of
[25:28.560 --> 25:33.920]  the board of patrol with buses coming in letting the kids get off not even
[25:33.920 --> 25:37.360]  checking who they are and letting them get in vans and drive off and we have
[25:37.360 --> 25:42.840]  the emergency manager saying the feds he's told give them the the greyhound
[25:42.840 --> 25:47.480]  tickets or vouchers and that most of them when they get off at his city already
[25:47.480 --> 25:52.280]  have them from the border patrol we got the guy's name and everything and then
[25:52.280 --> 25:56.760]  we have the federal purchase order back from January saying prepare for kids in
[25:56.760 --> 26:01.680]  Texas to be shipped into the u.s. to their families who are illegals and
[26:01.680 --> 26:09.760]  senator Ted Cruz yesterday had a chance to ask a few questions of J. Johnson who
[26:09.760 --> 26:16.200]  we are sending reporters today or he's having a press conference but it's just
[26:16.200 --> 26:20.160]  classic creative crisis offer the solution and I've got in the stack all
[26:20.160 --> 26:24.880]  over the news but in my stack they've got three mainstream articles going by
[26:24.880 --> 26:29.800]  Republicans going isn't it time for amnesty you don't like Obama having it
[26:29.800 --> 26:34.600]  by fiat do you totally open borders better give them what they want it's
[26:34.600 --> 26:41.200]  good for us they've already legalized the illegals by fiat and under this
[26:41.200 --> 26:44.720]  amnesty it lets everybody here who is the illegal stay and bring in their
[26:44.720 --> 26:51.080]  families so it's just as bad as this it's the same thing but they're saying we
[26:51.080 --> 26:54.640]  don't care of Congress won't pass what we want we'll do it by fiat which is
[26:54.640 --> 27:01.440]  called dictatorship I mean this is such a sensational time to be alive I don't
[27:01.440 --> 27:06.160]  use the word sensational in a good way I mean I've seen so few fatal
[27:06.160 --> 27:14.680]  sensational car wrecks I told the story people racing Corvette and a Z 28 I
[27:14.680 --> 27:22.280]  think it was down the I-30 bridge from Rockwall to Rowlett and when I was in a
[27:22.280 --> 27:26.840]  truck like 14 with my buddy driving we were driving into Rowlett to pick up
[27:26.840 --> 27:33.360]  some girls on a Saturday afternoon and take them to a movie and it was to say
[27:33.360 --> 27:37.160]  we didn't make the movie and two guys we knew from high school shoot past us on
[27:37.160 --> 27:45.240]  about 130 in medium traffic and that Corvette almost hits two cars cuts in
[27:45.240 --> 27:54.040]  front and has a blowout and stands up on its nose spinning but there was a
[27:54.040 --> 27:58.960]  railroad trestle on the side with some grass most of it was open to the water
[27:58.960 --> 28:04.400]  of air or everybody would have died and I saw that Corvette go spinning and then
[28:04.400 --> 28:10.440]  just exploding with gasoline and people flying around this is about 150 yards
[28:10.440 --> 28:15.680]  ahead of us they shoot by his turn blow up I see the car disintegrate get out
[28:15.680 --> 28:18.920]  right over blood spraying out of people's necks the whole nine yards I
[28:18.920 --> 28:24.880]  don't tell that story to be macabre I tell that story because I run into people
[28:24.880 --> 28:28.480]  that get a cut on their finger and they almost pass out and they freak out and
[28:28.480 --> 28:35.120]  I wonder my god what are they gonna do in life when they get cancer or when
[28:35.120 --> 28:39.400]  their kid runs through a you know plate glass window in front of them or when
[28:39.400 --> 28:46.200]  they get a compound fractures I mean I just that's why I found working with
[28:46.200 --> 28:49.720]  veterans of military people so good the media says they're horrible and don't
[28:49.720 --> 28:52.720]  hire them and their devils and they kill you in a minute is that they just don't
[28:52.720 --> 28:57.400]  think little stuff's a big deal and they're usually can do people because
[28:57.400 --> 29:02.280]  they've already seen so much real stuff and and then I saw another fatal accident
[29:02.280 --> 29:09.120]  one time with little kids because it happened about 500 yards ahead of me so
[29:09.120 --> 29:13.960]  I've stopped and pulled over and had to be there for a while and it was just
[29:13.960 --> 29:20.520]  little dead kids all over the place so many vans and I just so when I say
[29:20.520 --> 29:27.520]  sensational when I say spectacular ladies and gentlemen but it's things like
[29:27.520 --> 29:32.560]  that to give us character not that it's a good thing it just changes you you know
[29:32.560 --> 29:37.440]  like watching your grandfather die and take their last breath things like that
[29:37.440 --> 29:42.120]  it's fundamental effects and so many people are living in the false reality
[29:42.120 --> 29:45.720]  of their iPhones they have no idea the real world's going on all around them
[29:45.720 --> 29:53.880]  but right back we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the

[36:10.080 --> 36:15.280]  had great deal or quite a lot of confidence in television news in 2013
[36:15.280 --> 36:28.240]  it was 23% now it's dropped to 18% and let me tell you those are some really
[36:28.240 --> 36:32.600]  gullible people and that's what they say a lot of advertising I don't do this
[36:32.600 --> 36:37.720]  but how people that do do it they say there's about 20% that you can sell
[36:37.720 --> 36:44.480]  anything to you could sell snow cones to Eskimos without any syrup on top any
[36:44.480 --> 36:49.000]  cherry syrup on top even though they have plenty of ice you could sell it to
[36:49.000 --> 36:56.880]  them 20% and that's the people that the con artists feed on and I mean a con
[36:56.880 --> 36:59.960]  artist can go in a room just like a magician you can go in a room and pick
[36:59.960 --> 37:04.560]  the suggestible people and then basically get them to do whatever they
[37:04.560 --> 37:09.800]  want and we've all had people in our families preyed upon by that and it's
[37:09.800 --> 37:16.120]  one of my biggest pet peeves is watching really good people that I love in my
[37:16.120 --> 37:22.640]  family and extended family fed on by con artists and that's probably the group
[37:22.640 --> 37:28.640]  that I hate the most and I've been psychoanalyzing why I am so racked with
[37:28.640 --> 37:34.040]  guilt and I'm so privately neurotic and get so angry if people by mistake
[37:34.040 --> 37:39.440]  around here or myself do something that's unethical that's why I get so
[37:39.440 --> 37:44.160]  upset I've never been an uptight guilty person I just been trying to be an
[37:44.160 --> 37:55.760]  upstanding person is that I so dislike con artist and scammers and frauds that
[37:55.760 --> 38:01.920]  I don't want to look at the mirror and ever see that because my identity is
[38:01.920 --> 38:09.040]  about being honorable and good doesn't mean that I'm a perfect person and I
[38:09.040 --> 38:13.840]  know I keep going back to this but the change in me to try to be even better is
[38:13.840 --> 38:19.600]  the change in you it's all of us in a process people are either getting better
[38:19.600 --> 38:25.000]  and waking up becoming more connected less separated from each other more
[38:25.000 --> 38:30.240]  empathetic or they're becoming less empathetic less connected I know I'm
[38:30.240 --> 38:35.000]  stating incredibly simple things here but I was talking to a friend this
[38:35.000 --> 38:45.040]  morning about how his son and daughter-in-law come to see him and just a
[38:45.040 --> 38:51.160]  few years ago they come to town a few times a year and they would this guy's
[38:51.160 --> 38:59.840]  a lot older than me they would talk to him at dinner and his wife they would
[38:59.840 --> 39:06.160]  talk to him and they would have a discussion and they would really
[39:06.160 --> 39:13.800]  connect and now he and his wife sit there on their phones and click and text
[39:13.800 --> 39:17.160]  and and then he doesn't have a relationship basically with his son
[39:17.160 --> 39:20.960]  anymore and that we're losing our humanity to these smartphones and the
[39:20.960 --> 39:24.400]  computers and all the rest of it and it's one thing if you use it as a tool to
[39:24.400 --> 39:28.760]  reach out and a tool to connect that's what this shows all about but still the
[39:28.760 --> 39:33.880]  medium itself is dangerous is about being real about being complex about
[39:33.880 --> 39:38.720]  being three four-dimensional five-dimensional not one-dimensional but
[39:38.720 --> 39:44.040]  people are so one-dimensional now where they're not even there and they will
[39:44.040 --> 39:49.360]  only go find people that validate them in their delusion and I don't want this
[39:49.360 --> 39:54.200]  radio show to be like a niche radio broadcast where I sit here and I
[39:54.200 --> 39:58.480]  validate the Liberty Movement we need to look at ourselves as well but this is
[39:58.480 --> 40:01.880]  really how we're going to turn civilization around is the police not
[40:01.880 --> 40:07.960]  just validating each other but really look it in the mirror and say and when
[40:07.960 --> 40:18.040]  you check out of here as Gerald Salenta always says what did you stand for and
[40:18.040 --> 40:21.600]  don't you want to pay it forward for your children and their children other
[40:21.600 --> 40:26.840]  children I mean isn't that really what matters isn't winning being honorable
[40:26.840 --> 40:31.560]  being good loving beautiful things helping beautiful people helping innocent
[40:31.560 --> 40:34.520]  people helping good people I say beautiful I mean beautiful hearted
[40:34.520 --> 40:38.760]  people and being part of this great journey that's an unbroken chain to our
[40:38.760 --> 40:46.800]  species since its beginning there's a great kinsmanship and a spiritual
[40:46.800 --> 40:51.280]  connection to the ancestors that all primitive peoples have known that is a
[40:51.280 --> 40:57.040]  great form of solace even alone in a dungeon when you're doing the right
[40:57.040 --> 41:03.840]  thing you're there with all your kin the old north saying cattle die
[41:03.840 --> 41:08.040]  kinsmen die and cattle die but I know there's one thing that never dies it's
[41:08.040 --> 41:13.600]  the fame of a dead man's deed but it's not the fame that you were great or the
[41:13.600 --> 41:18.240]  fame that you could lift a big rock the greater fame was that you were
[41:18.240 --> 41:25.960]  honorable we have become a dishonored people we've dishonored our young
[41:25.960 --> 41:34.320]  imagine if wasp started killing their pupa killing their larvae and saying
[41:34.320 --> 41:42.440]  these aren't wasp you would say that's a species destroying itself so what is an
[41:42.440 --> 41:46.560]  elite that programs us to destroy ourselves they decided we're ugly and
[41:46.560 --> 41:49.920]  failed and bad and by making that decision with them governing our
[41:49.920 --> 41:55.760]  civilization that will then default ensure that that happens instead of
[41:55.760 --> 42:00.680]  struggling to be great and good which in that struggle we reach for the stars
[42:00.680 --> 42:07.200]  and we will not attain them but our progeny will so to take your calls
[42:07.200 --> 42:21.040]  toll free number 800-259-9231-8259-9231 there are agents of deception amongst us
[42:21.040 --> 42:30.840]  everywhere who seek to hurt the innocent and the the animating contest is now
[42:30.840 --> 42:39.880]  here and don't miss the train don't be a spectator because being a spectator
[42:39.880 --> 42:45.720]  means you lose your soul it means you lose choosing your destiny being the
[42:45.720 --> 42:50.400]  captain of your soul as it's been said read a poem last week about that and the
[42:50.400 --> 42:55.160]  captain isn't in control of everything but is making the decisions in their
[42:55.160 --> 43:01.200]  heart and in their mind which is the only decision that ever matters because it
[43:01.200 --> 43:09.680]  is about your development on this planet this is a test and biologically we live
[43:09.680 --> 43:16.040]  forever as long as the planet and the species isn't destroyed and it is like
[43:16.040 --> 43:28.680]  the allegory of something like the new film edge of tomorrow that we are our
[43:28.680 --> 43:36.160]  ancestors not reincarnated but our genetic ancestors and the race memories and
[43:36.160 --> 43:41.520]  all of it combined with other humans trying to get it right to go to the
[43:41.520 --> 43:48.360]  next level and that's God's beautiful plan of nanotech that we are universal
[43:48.360 --> 43:56.640]  living conscious creatures like a composite eye of God giving God that
[43:56.640 --> 44:04.240]  created the universe and is the universe a view from our perspective into the
[44:04.240 --> 44:15.600]  world but independent from God at the same time a shadow of the creator but
[44:15.600 --> 44:21.000]  still creators in our own right and you have the evil ones that like ringwraiths
[44:21.000 --> 44:25.440]  serve the ring on the dark force at the core of it then you have those of us that
[44:25.440 --> 44:32.560]  attempt and some attain the capability by the grace of the creator to then not
[44:32.560 --> 44:42.200]  become slaves but to become closer in the orbit to what it is to be good so you
[44:42.200 --> 44:51.200]  will descend or you will ascend there is no stagnant there is no set point in
[44:51.200 --> 45:02.320]  life or business or relationships they either get better or they get worse the
[45:02.320 --> 45:09.880]  lukewarm is what God spits out of his mouth because it doesn't exist the lukewarm
[45:09.880 --> 45:16.400]  is not in the universe there's not a knife edge of the lukewarm it doesn't
[45:16.400 --> 45:21.280]  exist you lie to yourself when you don't choose because if you don't choose you've
[45:21.280 --> 45:24.240]  still made a choice
[45:24.240 --> 45:32.640]  and the fake liberal system is a counterfeit of a liberal system it is the
[45:32.640 --> 45:40.720]  fraud it is anathema it is bondage it is death it is debilitating poverty you
[45:40.720 --> 45:45.520]  look at people that live under welfare and you look at their ancestors just
[45:45.520 --> 45:49.120]  three four generations back I've seen the photographs I've seen the case studies
[45:49.120 --> 45:54.760]  and they are upright smart people with their eyes on fire three four generations
[45:54.760 --> 45:58.600]  ago I don't care if they're poor whites in the Appalachians or poor blacks in
[45:58.600 --> 46:03.480]  Dallas Texas they now look like someone has sucked their soul out and they've
[46:03.480 --> 46:08.360]  got butts four feet wide and they've got diabetes and die when they're 40 years
[46:08.360 --> 46:17.440]  old they have literally been torn into pieces they have had their souls sucked
[46:17.440 --> 46:23.360]  out of them from a very young age to feed a system that wants to destroy them
[46:23.360 --> 46:30.040]  in a desecration of the Creator's creation a vandalization of beautiful
[46:30.040 --> 46:36.720]  creatures now I'm not signing on to that
[46:37.240 --> 46:44.920]  God fear isn't even so much in my gut fear of the Creator it is fear of the
[46:44.920 --> 46:54.480]  free will to join the evil and that abyss and then you recognize the evil in
[46:54.480 --> 47:00.640]  you and become fundamentally fearful that you are not shedding enough of it
[47:00.640 --> 47:08.960]  before you roll off this mortal coil it's for that reason I repent of all my
[47:08.960 --> 47:15.280]  thoughts that have been bad my greed my selfishness and my flesh and compared to
[47:15.280 --> 47:21.080]  most people people would consider if you knew me be extremely upright person but
[47:21.080 --> 47:27.400]  the humbleness is because I know it is dirty rags I can see reflected in the
[47:27.400 --> 47:38.320]  universe the face of the master builder the grand architect and I can see how
[47:38.320 --> 47:42.960]  great I am but also how weak I am and I'm gonna get emails saying the grand
[47:42.960 --> 47:47.200]  architects a Masonic term no it says that in the Bible of course all the
[47:47.200 --> 47:51.120]  systems have taken those names and every symbol and appropriated under their own
[47:51.120 --> 47:55.480]  groups I am not going to be judged anymore by other people taking symbols
[47:55.480 --> 47:59.120]  the new ruler takes the American flag and uses it for evil people say I don't
[47:59.120 --> 48:01.880]  want to see that flag how about we remember it for the good things it
[48:01.880 --> 48:06.360]  symbolized we need to take back the culture take back the symbols and take
[48:06.360 --> 48:11.480]  back the truth because the enemy claims they have it and they don't the truth
[48:11.480 --> 48:14.920]  was always with us from the beginning the power was always with us from the
[48:14.920 --> 48:20.040]  beginning and the solutions were always those of us that have a heart towards
[48:20.040 --> 48:26.760]  justice and even though we do bad and even though sometimes we stumble we look
[48:26.760 --> 48:31.720]  back on it with a true heart and repent like David who was a man who did
[48:31.720 --> 48:37.040]  terrible things in passion but truly repented and so is a man after God's
[48:37.040 --> 48:41.760]  own heart that is the secret to turning this evil around is getting our heart
[48:41.760 --> 48:46.360]  right let's talk to Brent in Texas then Nelson Bill Frank and Phil Brent thanks
[48:46.360 --> 48:49.720]  for calling in on this Friday edition welcome to the airwaves
[48:49.720 --> 48:54.840]  hey Alex thank you for taking my call the reason that I'm calling is because I
[48:54.840 --> 49:02.440]  stumbled across a video on YouTube and what it basically is is there's a guy
[49:02.440 --> 49:07.080]  named Sergeant Major Payne and this guy claims to be the first soldier in
[49:07.080 --> 49:12.520]  Afghanistan as well as the first soldier on the ground in Iraq he's affiliated
[49:12.520 --> 49:17.280]  with the special forces and this guy claims that in the video that he believed
[49:17.280 --> 49:21.560]  he was giving an interview to a church but it turned out that it was an
[49:21.560 --> 49:27.680]  old Keeper's meeting now in this video the gentleman actually says that there
[49:27.680 --> 49:34.460]  are special forces troops from NATO and other countries that are
[49:34.460 --> 49:38.080]  stationed all over the United States and I know this is a topic that you've
[49:38.080 --> 49:42.920]  covered before but this gentleman actually goes into details of how he's
[49:42.920 --> 49:48.120]  personally seen them the troop numbers the bases that these troops are
[49:48.120 --> 49:54.160]  located at it's really a wealth of knowledge there's a lot of it so sure
[49:54.160 --> 49:57.920]  I'll have to look into it and I don't want to sit or make judges before I've
[49:57.920 --> 50:02.080]  seen it but generally claiming I'm the first here I'm the first there troops
[50:02.080 --> 50:06.400]  have never left Afghanistan or Iraq ever there's always troops there there's
[50:06.400 --> 50:12.280]  always undercover people there the foreign troops are openly in the NLE
[50:12.280 --> 50:19.320]  tabletop exercises that FEMA made public in 2009 so there's mainstream articles
[50:19.320 --> 50:23.640]  about how they plan to use North American Union stabilization forces as Rand
[50:23.640 --> 50:28.080]  Corporation calls it and we give folks documents or we tell people where the
[50:28.080 --> 50:36.160]  listed FEMA camps are if the person's giving facts if the person is is is
[50:36.160 --> 50:41.280]  breaking down the specifics and then great we can go check them and verify

[54:09.640 --> 54:17.920]  into a burning ring of fire I went down down and the flames went higher and it
[54:17.920 --> 54:28.760]  burns burns burns the ring of fire the ring of fire and it burns burns burn the
[54:28.760 --> 54:35.760]  ring of fire the ring of fire the taste of love is sweet when hearts like ours
[54:35.760 --> 54:41.240]  meet I now realize I'm just gonna leave it at this that the entire quest of life
[54:41.240 --> 54:49.880]  is to build societies of honorable good decent people and to have friends and
[54:49.880 --> 54:55.920]  family you can count on that is true wealth and every civilization that was
[54:55.920 --> 55:01.520]  great knew that in fact civilization was never built on anything but that the
[55:01.520 --> 55:05.680]  Greeks the Romans were very upright at first only became nightmare corrupted
[55:05.680 --> 55:12.800]  the end and I just think God your lucky stars whatever you want to call it out
[55:12.800 --> 55:18.680]  there that I've had such a great life and been around so many good people and I
[55:18.680 --> 55:22.480]  don't know why I'm talking about this so much today it's just that I've been
[55:22.480 --> 55:26.240]  really upset this week about everything that's happening and I just have had a
[55:26.240 --> 55:32.400]  lot of peace this morning that everything will turn out okay in the end my
[55:32.400 --> 55:37.800]  greatest frustration is the world is so complex and it's so hard to properly
[55:37.800 --> 55:43.320]  articulate what I'm trying to get across to people on the issue by issue
[55:43.320 --> 55:48.280]  basis and I know how the enemies already spun everything so how do I decode
[55:48.280 --> 55:54.720]  that and try to reach through so people have that epiphany I want freedom for
[55:54.720 --> 56:04.000]  humanity because that is the oxygen of Liberty I want people just like you
[56:04.000 --> 56:10.760]  want people to be free so what do we have to do we have to become aggressive but
[56:10.760 --> 56:14.560]  also in our aggression against evil we don't want to cut corners and become
[56:14.560 --> 56:21.560]  evil we don't want to use the ring of Mordor to defeat the evil because when
[56:21.560 --> 56:29.000]  you stare into the abyss you become the abyss so we have to have that debate
[56:29.000 --> 56:35.040]  I'll tell you where we start we stop the late-term abortions we stop using
[56:35.040 --> 56:41.520]  abortion as birth control we start valuing human life again we stop killing
[56:41.520 --> 56:45.960]  old people and death panels you start demanding quality products again see
[56:45.960 --> 56:51.160]  we've just settled for crap myself included crap food crap culture crap
[56:51.160 --> 56:55.840]  everything and we've turned into fat slops and I don't just mean physically
[56:55.840 --> 57:02.880]  fat slops spiritually I'm a fat slob I know what quality is I know what beauty
[57:02.880 --> 57:09.720]  is but I am too lazy to even demand it and so the world rots and the same goes
[57:09.720 --> 57:13.280]  for you out there folks we know how to fix things I need to shut up go to calls
[57:13.280 --> 57:18.080]  I apologize Bill in Minnesota you're on the air awkward preaching go ahead hi
[57:18.080 --> 57:24.560]  Alex first-time caller I'm a little nervous break attack yet if I could I'd
[57:24.560 --> 57:29.320]  like to give you a little my little story quickly about police state and then
[57:29.320 --> 57:35.360]  talk about my experience with people not wanting to open their eyes to what's
[57:35.360 --> 57:41.600]  going on my background here in Minnesota is musician I go by the name of
[57:41.600 --> 57:46.560]  stick-up kid I'll get some CDs out there in 18 with all that but I was a
[57:46.560 --> 57:52.040]  stay-at-home dad and my wife took over the family business the land developer
[57:52.040 --> 57:57.360]  so we're doing pretty well the business is doing well next thing I know we're
[57:57.360 --> 58:04.840]  having troubles in our marriage and the locks were changed on me and also I'm
[58:04.840 --> 58:08.640]  homeless I'm trying to you know save the marriage figure out what's going on
[58:08.640 --> 58:18.000]  work it out and I show up and she's having a fear with a cop and man I lost
[58:18.000 --> 58:24.840]  everything so yeah well you understand as bad as it's been for you that cop and
[58:24.840 --> 58:28.920]  everybody are gonna have horrible lives now and it's all gonna come back on a
[58:28.920 --> 58:31.960]  little bit let's talk about it when we come back that's just part of the
[58:31.960 --> 58:36.720]  general evil but I want to hear how they use the system and what they did to you
[58:36.720 --> 58:40.720]  they tell women to change men like you change your wardrobe thank you for
[58:40.720 --> 58:45.680]  listening and men are pretty bad too but women are being told to do is break up
[58:45.680 --> 58:51.440]  marriages that's that's the thing to do a chemical spill contaminating the water
[58:51.440 --> 58:55.600]  supply in nine West Virginia counties this year alone over 300,000 people in
[58:55.600 --> 58:59.120]  West Virginia had their drinking water contaminate what are the health effects
[58:59.120 --> 59:02.880]  of having these drugs and our drinking water it's forced medical treatment
[59:02.880 --> 59:06.440]  without the consent of residents my friends water filtration is one of the
[59:06.440 --> 59:09.760]  most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the
[59:09.760 --> 59:13.560]  harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water on average the county says it

[59:51.040 --> 01:00:06.480]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network big brother
[01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:13.840]  mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's
[01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:23.680]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:36.800]  yeah I don't want to diagnose this in your case just from the school on the
[01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:43.800]  streets studying human behavior but women on average are told hey get your
[01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:49.160]  dad to stay at home making a mr. mom you go out and make the money or you run
[01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:52.880]  the career that's a great thing to do and most the time women end up not
[01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:57.040]  respecting that and getting rid of you and getting what they see as an alpha
[01:00:57.040 --> 01:01:03.560]  male that's just the way the biology works here on this planet and the system
[01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:10.200]  knows all that so they try to change that but and then and then women are
[01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:16.160]  told to use the system do whatever you want I mean I think something like
[01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:21.800]  almost 80% of divorces are filed by women and and men are slobs and men
[01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:25.680]  impress women it's usually an abuser relationship you'll have a man abusing a
[01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:30.840]  woman or have a woman abusing a man and they're always entitled and have
[01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:34.960]  excuses for what they're doing but I've heard about these cases where the cop
[01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:39.000]  gets your wife and that's like something out of a movie where the whole
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:42.800]  system's now against you and now the gang lines up against you and you're in
[01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:48.240]  deep crap but that's bearing false witness and generally when the system
[01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:55.120]  figures that out that person ends up getting in a lot of trouble but but I
[01:01:55.120 --> 01:02:00.120]  haven't even heard your story yet I'm just guessing bills calling from
[01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:04.920]  Minnesota a musician married his wife staying there they have a development
[01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:09.320]  business doing very well boom suddenly he's checked out of the house a cop
[01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:16.480]  moves in what happened from there on out okay so I had to you know it's
[01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:23.200]  homeless then I took a job as a janitor and had to get a apartment for myself
[01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:27.920]  then you know well right away see a man didn't a man wouldn't even usually on
[01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:31.360]  average go after the woman like that because a woman on average sees it
[01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:34.880]  psychologically the studies are there that they own you you know you're supposed
[01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:38.000]  to take care of them even though it's vice versa they want this equal system
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.880]  and so you're taking care of the kids now you're thrown out you would have
[01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:45.160]  immediately gone to a lawyer forced the sale of the house all the rest of it the
[01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:49.760]  assets but see the system just let her lock you out and now you're homeless go
[01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:56.000]  ahead so when I caught her then late with the cop I go in the house and turn on
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:59.040]  my I called the police right away because I didn't even know he was a cop I
[01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:03.320]  just knew there's a guy in the house so I call the police I start recording on my
[01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:08.080]  iPhone and the first thing I asked I went upstairs went to the guy and I said
[01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:11.880]  do you know my child have you been around my daughter and I film the whole
[01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:15.720]  thing and everybody that's seen it's like wow you know you just got your wife
[01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:20.480]  with another man I can't believe I'll call me we're in everything well I the
[01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:25.240]  police told me that to leave and I'm like no it's my house we own it
[01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:29.480]  together look at my license you know I'm on the beat and they said well here's
[01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:35.120]  the deal if she says she's scared of you you go to jail and she hasn't done that
[01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:39.280]  so you better just count your blessings and get out of here and then I was like
[01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:44.160]  yeah and again they were implying we'll let her fraudulently say this if you
[01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:47.600]  don't leave our brother alone and and those cops are gonna wonder why their
[01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:51.360]  kids are in car accidents while they get cancer I mean I'm telling you it's a
[01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:55.840]  law of the universe you use power to oppress somebody you can kiss your butt
[01:03:55.840 --> 01:04:02.080]  goodbye in the future and God will serve it cold and and that's a terrible
[01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:08.040]  terrible thing that happened to you so where did it go from there um so I ended
[01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:13.200]  up leaving she filed an order for protection on me yeah yeah they told
[01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:15.800]  her to do that and then he didn't have the money probably to go get a lawyer
[01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:20.960]  did to impeach that and prove it was a fraud I did because they had a video and
[01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:25.800]  I had an attorney that hold on here's the deal I got Bob Barr coming up for 30
[01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:29.440]  minutes this is an important story is when people are already into it so we're
[01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:33.480]  gonna recap it and cover at the bottom of the hour can you hold yeah now people
[01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:37.920]  need to hear this because this is I can you know this is the way this works and
[01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:41.680]  they've set it up this this is modern feminism where the states the man with
[01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:46.880]  the woman on her side but only to break up your family because they want to get
[01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:52.880]  her in the end but in this case the state's also sleeping with her Bill stay
[01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:56.920]  there then we'll go to Frank Phil Steve and others James after Bob Barr leaves
[01:04:56.920 --> 01:05:02.400]  us stay with us I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was

[01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:33.320]  network Bob Barr represented the seventh district of Georgia from 95 2003 and I
[01:08:33.320 --> 01:08:38.760]  remember him you know really criticizing the NSA the spying the police
[01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:44.280]  state to a great extent and being a hundred percent pro-second amendment
[01:08:44.280 --> 01:08:48.840]  national sovereignty I'd call him a paleo-conservative constitutionalist with
[01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:55.160]  a big libertarian streak Facebook.com Bob Barr Congress will give you his main
[01:08:55.160 --> 01:08:59.120]  website as well on screen for TV viewers but he's with us to the bottom of the
[01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:02.840]  hour then I'll get into all the other world news after I take phone calls for
[01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:08.520]  folks that are patiently holding but the reason I wanted to get him on today was
[01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:15.000]  to talk about the waterfront his take on what's going on with Obama giving awards
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:18.800]  to illegal alien kids obviously encourage them to come up here what the plan in
[01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:23.560]  that crisis he thinks is or whether he thinks it's an aptitude what's happening
[01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:29.720]  in Iraq with this ISIS group and where he sees Hillary and Obama making all
[01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:33.760]  these cryptic anti-gun statements about executive orders we need Australian
[01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:39.120]  style bands Obama said that last week on CBS I mean this is getting really
[01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:44.760]  scary because he's out done Nixon times a thousand in my view but he's just
[01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:50.520]  moving forward and I my gut my spidey sense says danger at will Robinson so
[01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:54.320]  running for Congress in the lead doesn't mean he'll win but we definitely need
[01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:57.920]  him in there is Bob Barr but before we get into all those subjects I wanted to
[01:09:57.920 --> 01:10:03.360]  first ask the former congressman soon to be congressman knock on wood what is
[01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:07.640]  your take on a lot of tea tea party true conservative libertarian candidates
[01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:14.520]  beating blue blood Republicans in Texas in Virginia with brat and others and the
[01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:18.240]  media spinning it oh the tea party's been discredited while a lot of blue
[01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:22.800]  bloods one that's not what I'm seeing in the numbers and the Republican attempts
[01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:27.680]  you know with the Democrats try to block to the tea party I only see real
[01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:32.520]  reform of the Republicans towards more of what their platform is towards their
[01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:36.440]  only hope compromising with the Democrats is what is extinct in the
[01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:40.600]  Republican Party now I'm not as politically savvy obviously as you as
[01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:47.160]  senior in the CIA a federal prosecutor before that you know somebody who was
[01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:52.400]  done international negotiations a congressman but is that approximation I
[01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:57.320]  made accurate or can you augment it or disagree with it I certainly wouldn't
[01:10:57.320 --> 01:11:00.360]  disagree with that not only because you're the host of this show but because
[01:11:00.360 --> 01:11:06.120]  you're right the fact of the matter is that the Cantor's loss and I know Eric
[01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:11.560]  Cantor I like him and you know he was doing a credible job as majority leader
[01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:16.920]  but he suffered from two things one what we call in the legal profession
[01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:21.760]  robotists judges once they get elected or appointed they don the black robe and
[01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:26.720]  they kind of you put themselves above the people and lose touch the lesson
[01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:31.440]  number one not for Eric is no matter how important your work in Washington is
[01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:36.040]  even if the people in your district support you and being a leader in the
[01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:40.840]  Congress because that brings prestige and so forth to your your district you
[01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:47.000]  cannot accept to your own peril forget the people back home you can't become so
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:50.720]  enamored of Washington power that you forget the people that sent you there
[01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:55.520]  and the people that you ultimately answer to secondly though I think those
[01:11:55.520 --> 01:12:01.920]  who try and downplay the importance of what congressman elect I guess he's not
[01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:07.040]  congressman elect but for all intents and purposes Brad represents is he
[01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:12.600]  represents a deep-seated and continuing movement among conservatives in this
[01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:17.560]  country to get people into office and keep people in office who will actually
[01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:22.400]  move our conservative agenda not Washington and agenda but our
[01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:27.000]  conservative agenda forward and that's what I'm hearing here in the 11th
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:31.120]  district of Georgia and I suspect that that's exactly what mr. Bratt was
[01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:35.040]  hearing in the 7th district of Virginia and again the districts have been
[01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:39.360]  rewritten you were in the 7th now you're running in the 11th which is much of
[01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:44.520]  Atlanta one of most important districts in the country with all these new tea
[01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:47.440]  party people that are going to be getting into office for the first time I
[01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:50.320]  think it's going to be great to have somebody like you I would call paleo
[01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:55.800]  tea party or proto tea party you know you were one of the few voices that would
[01:12:55.800 --> 01:12:59.840]  say things like Ron Paul was saying when you were there I mean I think your
[01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:04.680]  leadership you know knock on wood as I said is going to be so key getting back
[01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:10.600]  into Congress the sense I get now from Democrats that I've never seen in almost
[01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:14.200]  20 years on air and talking to family who've been politically involved and
[01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:19.360]  active for 50 years they've never seen Democrats this freaked out and realizing
[01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:23.080]  they've been betrayed I don't care what color they are cities from Virginia to
[01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:27.720]  New York with tens of thousands of illegal showing up the country's in a
[01:13:27.720 --> 01:13:32.880]  deep recession depression in areas I don't I don't know what the Democrats
[01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:38.360]  think they're doing being so incredibly radical and so incredibly criminal with
[01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:44.680]  the actions they're doing I mean I've never seen and in history never seen an
[01:13:44.680 --> 01:13:50.120]  American presidency act like this I don't think there's words to describe how
[01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:55.480]  bad it is so so so a what is your take on the on the seismic shift I see
[01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:59.040]  happening how would you describe that shift or do you agree it's happening and
[01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:05.560]  be one of the Democratic leaders thinking see what will they pull to try to get
[01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:12.480]  themselves out of this this this president is so bad he makes Jimmy
[01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:16.360]  Carter look like one of our best presidents ever I mean that's how bad
[01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:22.520]  this guy is and I know there's a lot of speculation Alex that it's not just
[01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:27.720]  sheer incompetence it being being that we're witnessing although there is deep
[01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:31.480]  see you at incompetence in this administration you just listen to
[01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:37.520]  Susan Rice his UN ambassador babble on about the Bergdahl case or something
[01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:43.240]  else and you realize these these are these are vacuums that were that were
[01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:48.040]  listening to their their their knowledge of world affairs or Middle Eastern
[01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:52.200]  affairs or military affairs it isn't that it's a mile wide and an inch deep
[01:14:52.200 --> 01:15:00.680]  it it just ain't there at all whether or not there is a concerted effort to
[01:15:00.680 --> 01:15:07.120]  dramatically change the lay of the land in the Middle East for example by arming
[01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:12.080]  terrorist groups in Syria that we know apparently know nothing about having
[01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:17.440]  them transfer and become active with the ISIS group and in Iraq and start taking
[01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:24.400]  over territory that we spent a great deal of of human and fiscal resources
[01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:28.960]  bringing some stability to over the last decade whatever it is this
[01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:34.760]  administration is causing deep and if we're not careful permanent damage to
[01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:39.160]  the America's ability to influence events in the world because the image we
[01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:43.520]  are presenting whether it's part of a concerted plan by Obama the ideologue
[01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:49.520]  or part of a of an unfortunate administration that we have that just
[01:15:49.520 --> 01:15:53.600]  has no earthly idea what it's doing that is an incompetent administration the
[01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:58.400]  message being sent to our adversaries and our allies is we do not know what
[01:15:58.400 --> 01:16:02.600]  we're doing we can't be trusted and therefore people are going to throw in
[01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:09.400]  with other groups other countries other leaders not the United States I had
[01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:12.440]  heard this when he was first running and and I didn't really believe it from a
[01:16:12.440 --> 01:16:17.040]  lot of really smart people but they said no Obama does really hate America the
[01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:22.120]  people he represents hate America kind of like the nation seizes 2016 and and
[01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:27.360]  they want a new new world order they want to realign the world with really
[01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:33.120]  anti-capitalist bent and that they just can't help it they want to wreck this
[01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:36.720]  country it's a famous statement when Bill Clinton was being inaugurated that
[01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:41.360]  night they had a bunch of f-16s fly over and Ron Silver this was documented in
[01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:45.080]  the news at the time sure you remember it said how dare them fly jets over us
[01:16:45.080 --> 01:16:48.760]  to threaten us to show the weird disconnect I mean it's made you do
[01:16:48.760 --> 01:16:53.160]  nothing about the military and they said no no Ron Hillary bumped him and said
[01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:59.160]  those are our jets now and I just it's one thing to be radicals in college and
[01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:02.960]  all this stuff but they're in control of the country and I just think they can't
[01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:07.080]  help wrecking it out of almost a subconscious hatred of it I think that
[01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:12.600]  best describes it congressman well Obama is clearly an ideologue which makes him
[01:17:12.600 --> 01:17:18.880]  very different and much more dangerous than Bill Clinton was back then and
[01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:23.400]  of course we we impeached Bill Clinton as you certainly recall we were very
[01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:29.320]  active in that and he became only the the very first elected president ever
[01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:34.200]  impeached Andrew Johnson was the first but he wasn't elected president and as
[01:17:34.200 --> 01:17:38.560]  you and I talked a few months ago I guess the last time I had the honor of
[01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:43.120]  being on your show we talked a little bit about you know impeachment and I
[01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:46.880]  indicated that I thought it was appropriate to begin an inquiry of
[01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:52.720]  impeachment not articles of impeachment but an inquiry and since then I've seen
[01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:58.920]  two very credible books come out on impeach impeachment of Obama many
[01:17:58.920 --> 01:18:06.320]  many articles so clearly there there is an awakening out there among a lot of
[01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:11.760]  Americans that these problems go beyond simple incompetence when you have a
[01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:17.160]  president that deliberately almost proudly Alex violates the law thumbs his
[01:18:17.160 --> 01:18:23.000]  nose figuratively speaking at the Congress when he not only fails to
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:29.960]  protect our borders in in Texas for example not only fails to follow the
[01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:36.120]  law with regard to apprehending those and deporting those who enter and
[01:18:36.120 --> 01:18:42.240]  remain in this country unlawfully but encourages encourages illegals to enter
[01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:47.680]  this country and uses our precious military resources which are stretched
[01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:53.560]  so thin already to simply as Sheriff Joe Arpaio my good friend out in Arizona
[01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:59.440]  said change diapers rather than protect our nation we've gone beyond simply
[01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:03.720]  well you know these problems will will resolve themselves they won't the
[01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:08.000]  American people and our representatives in the Congress in the house have to
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:13.800]  begin the process of rectifying this well I agree and so a lot of bad things
[01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:17.240]  are happening but I want people know the positive news I have never seen the
[01:19:17.240 --> 01:19:22.480]  emergency sirens going off like they are in the public's mind right now across
[01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:26.720]  the board and the fact that you notice he's not doing this total open deal in
[01:19:26.720 --> 01:19:31.000]  California that destabilizes the state they control they're doing it in Texas
[01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:35.840]  as part of this battleground Texas plan that project Veritas and James O'Keefe
[01:19:35.840 --> 01:19:40.080]  got on video six months ago where they said we're gonna flood things with
[01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:45.440]  illegals give them IDs let them vote and and and turn Texas blue and you know
[01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:51.520]  don't worry we're gonna get the guns there really is a criminal energy now
[01:19:51.520 --> 01:19:56.760]  to the Democrats I mean the Democrats of the say the 70s would be like the
[01:19:56.760 --> 01:20:04.200]  Republicans you know of of of a decade ago I mean they're so radical now and
[01:20:04.200 --> 01:20:08.960]  so out of control and we broke this three days ago drudgereport.com put it
[01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:11.960]  out and the media checked it and confirmed it we talked to emergency
[01:20:11.960 --> 01:20:16.040]  managers we got video the border patrols quitting and mass they blew the
[01:20:16.040 --> 01:20:21.120]  whistle and told us where to come and ice agent did in McCallan and Brownsville
[01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:25.360]  the buses drive over the border patrols ordered to stand down they load on white
[01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:29.960]  vans and are taken to Catholic and Protestant and evangelical churches
[01:20:29.960 --> 01:20:35.520]  and the border patrols gives them vouchers for the Greyhound tickets
[01:20:35.520 --> 01:20:39.600]  children and adults to drive quote into their families that are illegals as well
[01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:43.840]  so we have the video and people for two days couldn't believe it and now it's
[01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:50.440]  been confirmed we have the video sir of the border patrol in Texas if this is
[01:20:50.440 --> 01:20:55.000]  impeachable I know you filed the stuff first on Clinton so is it so you take
[01:20:55.000 --> 01:21:00.720]  action I mean this as you said makes Bill Clinton look like a choir boy that
[01:21:00.720 --> 01:21:04.760]  that it's going on and then to honor the Dream Act kids that are illegal while
[01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:07.760]  talking out the other side of his mouth saying oh no if you come here we'll
[01:21:07.760 --> 01:21:11.560]  deport you when they suspended most deportations including of aggravated
[01:21:11.560 --> 01:21:15.920]  felons you're a former federal prosecutor I mean what do you call this I
[01:21:15.920 --> 01:21:21.280]  mean this is what do you think they're gonna get out of this well what two
[01:21:21.280 --> 01:21:26.800]  questions there one it is it is in a sense a very clear example of
[01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:32.080]  obstruction of justice the failure tax keep the law and to deliberately stand
[01:21:32.080 --> 01:21:39.080]  in the way and take steps so that the law is not or cannot be carried out it
[01:21:39.080 --> 01:21:47.600]  also is clearly dereliction of duty failure to failure to honor his oath of
[01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:54.000]  office and that these all are those sorts of things that Alexander Hamilton one
[01:21:54.000 --> 01:22:00.160]  of the authors of the Federalist papers described as high crimes and misdemeanors
[01:22:00.160 --> 01:22:06.160]  not only direct criminal actions such as obstruction of justice and perjury as
[01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:11.960]  committed by Bill Clinton not only are those sort of actions are clearly
[01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:17.520]  impeachable in the sort of actions by president that that our founders envisioned
[01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:23.880]  as providing grounds for impeachment but even if it is not a president deliberately
[01:22:23.880 --> 01:22:30.440]  and explicitly violating a law but simply engaging in policies that subvert
[01:22:30.440 --> 01:22:37.040]  the rule of law instituting policies to do so then those also even though they
[01:22:37.040 --> 01:22:43.880]  may not be legally criminal acts they are the sorts of public acts that a
[01:22:43.880 --> 01:22:48.560]  president carries out that were envisioning clearly and explicitly in
[01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:52.520]  some of the Federalist writings by Hamilton the sort that should give rise
[01:22:52.520 --> 01:22:58.000]  to to impeachment well strong words but we have strong actions from Obama and
[01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:03.320]  the Democrats so that's we have to respond with how do you how do you when
[01:23:03.320 --> 01:23:05.240]  you're inside knowledge how these guys work
[01:23:05.240 --> 01:23:10.720]  congressman Bob Barr joining us if you just tuned in how do you think they
[01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:14.920]  think they're getting away with this because they seem to be just desperately
[01:23:14.920 --> 01:23:19.600]  trying to sink the ship as fast as they can is it clowered and piven just a
[01:23:19.600 --> 01:23:23.280]  plan to bring in so many people that are destitute that overwhelms the system and
[01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:29.400]  we collapse into pure socialism well it it's it's an effort with with regard to
[01:23:29.400 --> 01:23:34.840]  this you know specific crisis that they are creating and fostering and flaming
[01:23:34.840 --> 01:23:40.960]  with all of these children and these aren't just just toddlers and diapers
[01:23:40.960 --> 01:23:48.960]  other ms-13 you name it yep they are teenagers sometimes preteens who are
[01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:54.760]  very clearly part of violent gangs in some instances I wouldn't be surprised
[01:23:54.760 --> 01:23:59.520]  that they have had actually engaged at murder we have very clear evidence that
[01:23:59.520 --> 01:24:06.560]  these gangs do enlist children sometimes under even preteens to go out and
[01:24:06.560 --> 01:24:11.560]  commit murders because they are less suspect if you see them so what what
[01:24:11.560 --> 01:24:18.120]  we're witnessing here is an effort to bring in a lot of these illegals disperse
[01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:24.720]  them around the country so that they it then becomes much much harder to find
[01:24:24.720 --> 01:24:29.720]  them to identify them to make them appear in court none of these people
[01:24:29.720 --> 01:24:34.000]  virtually are going to appear in court once they've been released and they say
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:38.480]  on video sir they say on video that they just send them wherever they want to be
[01:24:38.480 --> 01:24:43.440]  sent to quote families and drop them off at bus stations paid for by taxpayers
[01:24:43.440 --> 01:24:50.600]  yeah and in the meantime we're using our military bases which which ought to
[01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:57.080]  be engaging in exercises to protect our nation and so forth they're having to
[01:24:57.080 --> 01:25:01.760]  babysit with and use our taxpayer resources that should be going to
[01:25:01.760 --> 01:25:07.280]  military pay maintaining military bases buying equipment so forth it's being
[01:25:07.280 --> 01:25:12.600]  used to babysit these people why don't we for example put them on planes or
[01:25:12.600 --> 01:25:18.360]  buses and send them back to Mexico that would be 50 times cheaper now yeah even
[01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:23.200]  even though these are not all Mexican nationals they you know some of them
[01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:26.240]  are many of them apparently are coming in from other countries in Central
[01:25:26.240 --> 01:25:31.760]  America they are coming from Mexico obviously Mexico is a big part of the
[01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:36.280]  problem they are doing nothing to stem this time they are they are encouraging
[01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:41.000]  it we have or should have a great deal of influence that we can bring to bear
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:44.640]  with regard to Mexico because of the trade and other relations that we have
[01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:49.560]  with Mexico what are we doing now apparently nothing to force Mexico to
[01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:53.160]  address this problem we ought to be sending them back across the border by
[01:25:53.160 --> 01:25:57.640]  the bus load as soon as they cross over and we can apprehend them instead of
[01:25:57.640 --> 01:26:02.760]  taking care of them here it's Mexico's problem let Mexico deal with it bar
[01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:08.720]  congress dot com bar congress dot com or Bob bar.org redirects there only got
[01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:15.040]  about five minutes or four minutes left when you want to move quick now speaking
[01:26:15.040 --> 01:26:19.200]  of military pay the death list just like the death panels every military person
[01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:22.680]  I've talked to even Democrats say in the last six years the VA has gone from bad
[01:26:22.680 --> 01:26:27.200]  to nightmarish hell and so we're going to house illegal alien kids and they
[01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:30.640]  complain the food isn't good enough it's a lot better than Michelle Obama public
[01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:34.320]  school food and then the and then literally the VA isn't taking care of the
[01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:39.800]  troops speak to the VA a little more on Iraq and any other points congressman
[01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:45.720]  Bob Bar with regard to the VA this is this this you know some people say I
[01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:49.160]  don't have a heart but if I did have a heart this would bring it to tears what
[01:26:49.160 --> 01:26:53.000]  our Veterans Administration the Department is a veteran the Department of
[01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:57.400]  Veterans Affairs is doing their veterans is killing them through their inaction
[01:26:57.400 --> 01:27:02.280]  their cowardice to own up to the sorry record that many of these hospital have
[01:27:02.280 --> 01:27:08.240]  and engaging in what Alex I have to tell you appears to me to be a possible
[01:27:08.240 --> 01:27:13.800]  racketeering enterprise or Rico when you look at the the the fraud that has been
[01:27:13.800 --> 01:27:19.240]  going on and at the very possible destruction of records alteration of
[01:27:19.240 --> 01:27:22.840]  official documents in order to make themselves not look so bad as they
[01:27:22.840 --> 01:27:28.400]  really are at some of these hospitals I think a good prosecutor at the national
[01:27:28.400 --> 01:27:32.680]  level should be looking at putting together a Rico case a racketeering
[01:27:32.680 --> 01:27:37.680]  enterprise case against these individuals and some of the VA
[01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:42.680]  institutions at which they've been doing this it is right risen beyond simply a
[01:27:42.680 --> 01:27:47.120]  bureaucratic problem I think we have a criminal problem with the Veterans
[01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:51.800]  Amendment absolutely putting people on secret illegal death list and basically
[01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:55.080]  let them die that's a mating and abetting and murder and then that
[01:27:55.080 --> 01:28:00.040]  dovetails with the missing emails from all these different officials with the
[01:28:00.040 --> 01:28:07.360]  IRS I mean this is incredible it is we saw this to it to a smaller extent Alex
[01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:12.000]  you may remember with some of the White House travel documents and some of the
[01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:16.480]  whitewater documents where they they tried to claim that the emails were
[01:28:16.480 --> 01:28:22.240]  missing oh gee they had you know just just paid it into the ether that doesn't
[01:28:22.240 --> 01:28:28.160]  happen I think that given the lethargy at our Department of Justice where we
[01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:32.600]  have an attorney general who not only force tries to force the administration
[01:28:32.600 --> 01:28:37.000]  to abide by the law but enables it and encourages the administrative this
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:42.200]  administration to violate the law given them legal cover you know we ought to
[01:28:42.200 --> 01:28:48.880]  demand that a special prosecutor be appointed unfortunately we don't have
[01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:55.760]  any longer the independent council statute but in the absence of that what
[01:28:55.760 --> 01:29:01.520]  we ought to see is a select committee on this veterans administration scandal
[01:29:01.520 --> 01:29:07.080]  which to me is every bit if not more important than the very important work
[01:29:07.080 --> 01:29:11.440]  of the Benghazi select committee well folks you to get behind your campaign
[01:29:11.440 --> 01:29:15.480]  in closing I'm no former federal prosecutor or constitutional lawyer like
[01:29:15.480 --> 01:29:19.480]  you but this whole administration operates like an organized crime syndicate
[01:29:19.480 --> 01:29:23.960]  like you said racketeering I mean bottom line do you do you think the Obama
[01:29:23.960 --> 01:29:29.880]  administration is a criminal enterprise if I if I were still a prosecutor the
[01:29:29.880 --> 01:29:33.360]  flags would be going up and waving and the red lights will be going off but
[01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:36.960]  where there's smoke there's fire all right thank you so much hopefully we can
[01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:41.520]  get you back in the next month as things heat up thank you Bob Barth thanks

[01:30:03.880 --> 01:30:07.400]  this year alone over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water
[01:30:07.400 --> 01:30:11.320]  contaminated what are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking

[01:32:04.560 --> 01:32:08.400]  forefront situation the police are shoving people shoving Alex shoving the

[01:33:18.100 --> 01:33:21.040]  We're going right to your phone calls here in a moment
[01:33:21.040 --> 01:33:24.840]  here are the headlines out of uh Arizona
[01:33:24.840 --> 01:33:32.280]  Republican others. Migrants amassing at Rio Grande's edge by the thousands. They
[01:33:32.280 --> 01:33:41.160]  can show the videos and photos of just a mass exodus into El Norte, a planned
[01:33:41.160 --> 01:33:47.400]  total invasion, a political invasion to join with the Democrats, and this is the
[01:33:47.400 --> 01:33:50.520]  move to totally take down America, as General Petraeus said, into the North
[01:33:50.520 --> 01:33:56.640]  American Union. Approval of Obama's handling of immigration falls to 31
[01:33:56.640 --> 01:34:01.560]  percentage points. So see, even with Democrats, it's very unpopular now.
[01:34:01.560 --> 01:34:11.040]  That's in Gallup. Well, that's from an all-time high of 62%. It's down by more
[01:34:11.040 --> 01:34:17.640]  than half. Dinesh D'Souza's America banished from the New York Times best
[01:34:17.640 --> 01:34:21.600]  seller's list. It didn't matter that it was on the New York Times best seller
[01:34:21.600 --> 01:34:33.040]  list. They just removed it. It was already in the top 10, but they just
[01:34:33.040 --> 01:34:38.960]  removed it. So that's how they operate there, and we're getting reports of
[01:34:38.960 --> 01:34:44.000]  Liberty-based, libertarian, that's what they're really afraid of, YouTube
[01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:49.280]  channels, you name it, being purged and removed everywhere. We're being blocked
[01:34:49.280 --> 01:34:55.640]  still by the Pentagon on many systems. This is how they're responding to us
[01:34:55.640 --> 01:35:00.440]  speaking out, is trying to shut us up. That's why you can't take this show for
[01:35:00.440 --> 01:35:04.520]  granted, and I know you know that. You can't take having an AM or FM station for
[01:35:04.520 --> 01:35:09.080]  granted in your area that carries my show. You can't take it for granted that
[01:35:09.080 --> 01:35:12.640]  you can go to infowars.com and subscribe to the free podcast or watch the free
[01:35:12.640 --> 01:35:16.960]  video feed at infowars.com or slash show. You can't take it for granted that you
[01:35:16.960 --> 01:35:21.040]  can get a $5.95 a month prisonplanet.tv membership to see all my
[01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:25.760]  films and HD, 19 years of material, the site's been up for 12 years, the
[01:35:25.760 --> 01:35:30.200]  nightly news, special live reports, and then share it with 11 people
[01:35:30.200 --> 01:35:35.520]  simultaneously. 11 people can use your $5.95 a month membership. What a great
[01:35:35.520 --> 01:35:41.720]  way to wake folks up. And I know you don't take it for granted most of you, but we
[01:35:41.720 --> 01:35:46.920]  aren't gonna be here and you're not gonna have any liberty if we don't win this
[01:35:46.920 --> 01:35:51.440]  thing. And winning just means surviving and backing them off, because the more
[01:35:51.440 --> 01:35:55.480]  time we buy, the more time we can fix this country. Freedom is becoming more and
[01:35:55.480 --> 01:35:59.320]  more popular. Doesn't matter if half the public can't tie their shoelaces or
[01:35:59.320 --> 01:36:04.000]  disassociated, can't make connections, don't know who they are, look at TV
[01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:07.640]  screens all day and iPads and don't talk to each other. You go to a restaurant,
[01:36:07.640 --> 01:36:11.040]  half the folks are having passionate conversations, they're putting the iPhone
[01:36:11.040 --> 01:36:14.840]  in their bag and they're becoming more human. But other people are sinking
[01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:18.520]  deeper into it. They're victims, I don't laugh at how dumb they are, I don't pray
[01:36:18.520 --> 01:36:23.640]  on them like the globalist, but I move on. You gotta triage them. Triage, you got
[01:36:23.640 --> 01:36:27.960]  a thousand people blown up and you can spend all your time on those you can't
[01:36:27.960 --> 01:36:31.800]  save and then lose all the people in the middle that are on the borderline. You
[01:36:31.800 --> 01:36:35.560]  gotta save the people that you've got a chance to save. The ones that are too far
[01:36:35.560 --> 01:36:39.720]  gone, you can't save them. You don't have enough people. And it's the same thing.
[01:36:39.720 --> 01:36:43.760]  I'm not gonna beat my head in the wall against some programmed cognitive
[01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:48.680]  dissonance, you know, person who can't be reached. I'm gonna feel sorry for them
[01:36:48.680 --> 01:36:51.600]  and say, hey, when they hit you hard later, remember, you were warned and
[01:36:51.600 --> 01:36:56.880]  sometimes they'll remember. Move on to people that want to be awakened. You can
[01:36:56.880 --> 01:37:00.480]  figure out ways to not go along with the system. You don't need me to sit here and
[01:37:00.480 --> 01:37:04.880]  tell you everything every day. You know what needs to be done. I mean, let me tell
[01:37:04.880 --> 01:37:09.920]  you something. There's a lot of business owners out there who get sick of the new
[01:37:09.920 --> 01:37:14.080]  world order, harassing them in Obamacare. And you shut down your carpet company.
[01:37:14.080 --> 01:37:18.680]  You shut down your publishing company. You shut down your car dealership. You
[01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:23.240]  shut down the restaurants you own. Your mama gets cancer or you're old. Don't
[01:37:23.240 --> 01:37:26.880]  want to work anymore. People that are Liberty Lovers have to stay in business,
[01:37:26.880 --> 01:37:31.800]  have to make money to hire like-minded people and build a civilization and
[01:37:31.800 --> 01:37:37.160]  society. The globalists want to control money and markets to run our lives. The
[01:37:37.160 --> 01:37:41.520]  most aggressive thing you can do is have your own business, promote it, win.
[01:37:41.520 --> 01:37:45.320]  Christians put out a little fish symbol to say, do business with us. Why don't
[01:37:45.320 --> 01:37:49.600]  Liberty members put a rattlesnake in the window? Don't tread on me. And when you
[01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:56.200]  see that, do business with them. We have to, we have to work together. We have to
[01:37:56.200 --> 01:38:01.960]  buy local. We have to go into the minority communities and find restaurants we
[01:38:01.960 --> 01:38:07.480]  like and buy food from them and products from them and encourage them to come in
[01:38:07.480 --> 01:38:12.200]  to quote your community and support people that are doing it right. We've
[01:38:12.200 --> 01:38:17.680]  got to come together as humans around shared values of freedom. And what
[01:38:17.680 --> 01:38:22.480]  we've got is sexy, folks. What the new order is selling is bondage. And we've
[01:38:22.480 --> 01:38:28.280]  got to talk the talk and walk the walk. And we can change society with a new
[01:38:28.280 --> 01:38:34.200]  renaissance. A new enlightenment. We're on the edge of it. All this tyranny with
[01:38:34.200 --> 01:38:39.680]  the technocracy and the tracker chips and all new droids are coming out. That's
[01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:43.640]  in Wired Magazine today. We have an article on InfoWars.com about it. All
[01:38:43.640 --> 01:38:48.040]  new droids are coming out with kill switches in them so the government can
[01:38:48.040 --> 01:38:52.720]  kill all your phones with one butt. That's why it's going to be a big market and
[01:38:52.720 --> 01:38:58.000]  old tech in the future. Keep it. Keep it running. Keep it working. Old video
[01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:02.800]  cameras, new companies that will sell video cameras, you know, dash cams that
[01:39:02.800 --> 01:39:09.520]  don't have kill switches in them. You've got to realize life is a war. Being free
[01:39:09.520 --> 01:39:14.760]  is a war and it's not work. Being involved the first 20 times you
[01:39:14.760 --> 01:39:19.000]  exercise again worked out in years. It's horrible. But the 21st time, the 30th
[01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:25.440]  time, the 40th time, it becomes addicting. And we got to just turn the corner. We
[01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:29.280]  got to make the decision to turn. The body will follow and the rest of the
[01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:33.480]  people will follow as well. I want to go to your calls. It's just that if you're a
[01:39:33.480 --> 01:39:38.200]  business owner, we're getting affiliates all over the country. And these, some of
[01:39:38.200 --> 01:39:41.600]  them are big stations, some of them small stations, some of them media stations. Some
[01:39:41.600 --> 01:39:45.080]  of them are business people that have been successful are buying 50,000 waters
[01:39:45.080 --> 01:39:48.360]  and putting me on the air. It's happening all over the country. And we talk to these
[01:39:48.360 --> 01:39:51.480]  stations. We hear from them and they're like, look, we know there's no future if
[01:39:51.480 --> 01:39:58.880]  we don't go all in. Well, you got a business. You should say, you know, a big
[01:39:58.880 --> 01:40:01.800]  American flag billboard billboards are cheaper than ever now because we're in a
[01:40:01.800 --> 01:40:09.040]  depression and say, tune into Alex Jones on this frequency and then brought to
[01:40:09.040 --> 01:40:16.320]  you by your tile company brought to you by whatever you're doing or just put a
[01:40:16.320 --> 01:40:21.080]  website up there info wars.com or you start a site and clone info wars and put
[01:40:21.080 --> 01:40:25.240]  it up. That's even better. So they can't even take us down. I want you to redistribute.
[01:40:25.240 --> 01:40:28.680]  I want you to clone what we've done and then augment it with your own humance
[01:40:28.680 --> 01:40:34.360]  and intelligence. I'm waging a hardcore war here. I'm 100% ready for them to stick
[01:40:34.360 --> 01:40:37.080]  a gun to my head and blow my head off. I don't want to die, but I love life so
[01:40:37.080 --> 01:40:41.720]  much. It means nothing to me. It's beyond not having fear. Ladies and gentlemen,
[01:40:41.720 --> 01:40:50.000]  it's wanting liberty. It's desiring it above all things to have free will. And
[01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:55.320]  if the people that are middle class that are targeted, if the veterans and if the
[01:40:55.320 --> 01:41:00.120]  gun owners and of the business owners, if you get aggressive and turn 10% of your
[01:41:00.120 --> 01:41:06.840]  energy towards doing your own local radio show, you may be 60% of the billboards
[01:41:06.840 --> 01:41:12.720]  of my show. And in the corner, tune in Sundays to in your show and just go by the
[01:41:12.720 --> 01:41:17.640]  time sponsored by you, they'll give it to you. They'll put you on the air. It'll
[01:41:17.640 --> 01:41:21.400]  probably end up making the money back. When you plug your service, whoever you
[01:41:21.400 --> 01:41:25.560]  sell as advertisers, I told people how to do this and then you will be talking to
[01:41:25.560 --> 01:41:29.960]  tens of thousands of people. Go do an access show and you're like, well, I don't
[01:41:29.960 --> 01:41:35.000]  want to get on air. Well, you know what? We're going to lose everything. I realized
[01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:39.000]  that when I was 21 years old, I saw what was happening and I saw it way off and
[01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:44.680]  knew it had to be countered. And I mean, I'm just as average as anybody. I got
[01:41:44.680 --> 01:41:49.320]  better at this doing it for 19 years. Just like you do. You worked out for 19
[01:41:49.320 --> 01:41:53.640]  years. Folks, you're going to get in good shape. Well, I've been fighting these
[01:41:53.640 --> 01:41:59.880]  people right up at point blank range for really 22 years, but 19 on air. And look
[01:41:59.880 --> 01:42:07.080]  what I've done. You can do it. But people ask, what do you do? You warn the public.
[01:42:07.080 --> 01:42:13.160]  You lead by example. You get aggressive. And I, I want all the business owners
[01:42:13.160 --> 01:42:18.920]  out there to call your local AM and FM affiliate and say, I want to advertise on
[01:42:18.920 --> 01:42:26.520]  the Alex Jones show. And maybe you pay at a discounted PSA rate and say, I'd like
[01:42:26.520 --> 01:42:29.960]  to just have one of your voice readers read the second amendment, the first
[01:42:29.960 --> 01:42:34.440]  amendment, maybe a George Washington quote and then say, brought to you by, you
[01:42:34.440 --> 01:42:41.160]  know, Johnson's tile. I'm just saying that like John Doe, Jones tile or, or, or, or
[01:42:41.160 --> 01:42:45.720]  Jones yard service. And you're going to get a bigger response for your company.
[01:42:45.720 --> 01:42:48.920]  What's incredible about this is when you don't go with the standard advertising
[01:42:48.920 --> 01:42:52.920]  pitch, I'm telling myself this, that's what I need to do. And just go with it's
[01:42:52.920 --> 01:42:56.120]  about the message. And then by the way, I'm bringing you this information.
[01:42:56.120 --> 01:42:59.000]  You're going to get a better response. You're going to fund this show.
[01:42:59.800 --> 01:43:05.000]  You're going to help us reach more people. That's what you got to do. I want every
[01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:08.440]  one of our AM and FM affiliates, whether it's affiliates in Austin or Chicago
[01:43:09.160 --> 01:43:15.880]  or Albuquerque, New Mexico or Las Vegas or Boston or DC or Orlando. I don't care
[01:43:15.880 --> 01:43:21.320]  where you are. I'm going to your calls. I mean, plug anything. I need to plug so
[01:43:21.320 --> 01:43:28.280]  we can find ourselves. I need you because you people talk about, Oh, I'm buying guns.
[01:43:28.280 --> 01:43:32.040]  You know, I'm ready for a war. No, no, no. Let me tell you, if you don't fight now
[01:43:32.040 --> 01:43:35.480]  with billboards and going to speak into the church, you know, is there anything now
[01:43:35.480 --> 01:43:38.680]  that we want to talk about the church? You should go to churches and get up and say,
[01:43:38.680 --> 01:43:42.600]  Yeah, I'm here to talk about something and bring it up. Engage in leadership.
[01:43:42.600 --> 01:43:46.280]  They've captured most of the churches. They've captured the media. We got to take it back.
[01:43:46.280 --> 01:43:53.400]  And you and your sector engage the enemy. They'll bleed out very quickly.
[01:43:54.600 --> 01:43:58.360]  Victory is in our hand. All we got to do is close our hand around it.
[01:44:00.120 --> 01:44:05.720]  But it's going to take, like when I was 19, they were trying to ban guns in Austin
[01:44:06.520 --> 01:44:09.080]  because they didn't have laws passed by them to block, you know, cities,
[01:44:09.080 --> 01:44:13.320]  violate state law and federal. It was hard to go before the city council. It was hard
[01:44:13.320 --> 01:44:19.560]  to go before county commissioners when I was 19. It was hard to go start an access show by myself
[01:44:19.560 --> 01:44:23.240]  in the control room with a camera and go on the air for the first time live to a big audience
[01:44:23.240 --> 01:44:29.160]  back then that huge viewership. But I did it because I instinctively knew somebody had to do it.
[01:44:32.360 --> 01:44:38.280]  You got to do it. And you got to say, I'm going to be a leader. God strengthened me.
[01:44:38.280 --> 01:44:42.760]  And you will have the fire and the leadership and people will connect with the fact
[01:44:42.760 --> 01:44:46.520]  that even though you may stumble over your words, even though you may blink in the right
[01:44:46.520 --> 01:44:52.920]  lights of publicity, that you're real and they'll come to you. Run for office like Bratt and so
[01:44:52.920 --> 01:44:56.920]  many others are doing. They can't stop us all. There's more of us than there are of them.
[01:44:58.600 --> 01:45:01.960]  But you got to get in the arena. You got to get out of the bleachers, folks. You got to get on
[01:45:01.960 --> 01:45:07.480]  the field. That's where the animating contest is happening. Join your ancestors in the animating
[01:45:07.480 --> 01:45:14.520]  contest. Seize to be a spectator. Seize to be a programmable robot. Become a man, a woman.
[01:45:17.160 --> 01:45:20.600]  Now, I'm going to go to the caller who earlier, I'm going to have him briefly recap what happened
[01:45:20.600 --> 01:45:25.080]  to him when his wife threw him out and moved to cop in. Didn't even get a restraining order.
[01:45:25.080 --> 01:45:29.240]  He came home. They called the cops on him. He was going to finish the story. But briefly,
[01:45:30.840 --> 01:45:35.720]  I'm not going to belabor this. We sell great supplements at infowarslife.com and they snide
[01:45:35.720 --> 01:45:43.000]  eye in the super survival shield X2, the super male vitality, the super female vitality. All of
[01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:46.920]  it really is powerful organic and it's done a great thing for me and you've heard the reviews
[01:45:46.920 --> 01:45:51.720]  and it helps find the operation, which is very expensive infowarslife.com. Very expensive
[01:45:51.720 --> 01:45:56.280]  for this operation. We've been helping us do it. We've got more of the lung cleanse in. We've got
[01:45:56.280 --> 01:46:02.440]  a detox special more than 25% off running right now with the fluoride shield and the survival
[01:46:02.440 --> 01:46:08.200]  shield X2 together, both discounted. That's the best discount we've run so far. Introductory
[01:46:08.200 --> 01:46:13.560]  rate is very popular. So we'll do that while supplies last infowarslife.com. We still have
[01:46:13.560 --> 01:46:18.920]  the free stainless steel stands with 10% off promo code water with all orders of the propure
[01:46:20.200 --> 01:46:25.640]  G 2.0 systems that cut off the glyphosates. That's the roundup, the fluoride and hundreds of other
[01:46:25.640 --> 01:46:31.080]  chemicals. I mean, how evil, sensational is that that last week I saw a mainstream article
[01:46:31.080 --> 01:46:35.640]  that covered on the nightly news where yeah, you're a caller calling about it. Then I went
[01:46:35.640 --> 01:46:39.400]  and looked it was an article. Yeah, cities are admitting because of disclosure that there's
[01:46:39.400 --> 01:46:45.160]  hundreds of toxic chemicals they add to your water. It's toxic waste that you pay to get from
[01:46:45.160 --> 01:46:50.120]  these companies, the aluminum smelters they put in the water. I mean, that's so over the top.
[01:46:50.120 --> 01:46:58.360]  Can't we beat that? Can't we stop that? Well, if they won't do it at your city level yet,
[01:46:58.360 --> 01:47:02.920]  filter the water, support the broadcast, it's a win-win. If it's not a win-win, I don't promote it.
[01:47:02.920 --> 01:47:10.520]  infowarsstore.com for those or 888-2533139. All right, we got Frank and Phil and Jay and Steve
[01:47:10.520 --> 01:47:14.680]  that have been holding in some cases for an hour and I apologize. We've got another guest coming
[01:47:14.680 --> 01:47:19.720]  up and I may back them off a little bit. But no, no, no, no, Chad Cooper is on at the bottom of
[01:47:19.720 --> 01:47:23.080]  the next hour. So plenty of time. I'll get to everybody, I promise. I'm going to try to shut
[01:47:23.080 --> 01:47:28.760]  up and get to you, but wild horses couldn't rack me away from having the great honor to be speaking
[01:47:28.760 --> 01:47:32.760]  to you. Sir, finish your story in Minnesota. Recap it in one minute and then in the two minutes we
[01:47:32.760 --> 01:47:40.920]  have after that, tell folks how it all ended. Go ahead. Okay, so stay at home, dad. The wife
[01:47:40.920 --> 01:47:47.480]  was taken over the family land development business doing really well. I have a degree in music,
[01:47:47.480 --> 01:47:53.800]  so as a part-time musician, I'd stay home with my daughter during the day and teach out of the house
[01:47:53.800 --> 01:47:57.960]  in the evening and then gig on the weekend. Yeah, standard, standard deal. And she married you
[01:47:57.960 --> 01:48:00.680]  and that's what she did. So you show up, the doors are locked, there's a cop in there.
[01:48:02.040 --> 01:48:07.000]  Exactly, yeah. The doors are locked and I show up to give her a birthday present trying to save
[01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:11.800]  the marriage. That's when I caught her with the cop. I didn't know he was a cop at the time,
[01:48:11.800 --> 01:48:18.120]  so I called the police and then I started filming the whole thing and just calmly asked the guy
[01:48:18.120 --> 01:48:24.120]  if he's been around my kid, what's going on. She filed an order for protection on me and that's
[01:48:24.120 --> 01:48:30.200]  when I finally got an attorney. We go to court and it's thrown out because I have evidence and
[01:48:30.200 --> 01:48:35.960]  whatnot and they knew they couldn't, you know, fight me on it because I had the video. So right
[01:48:35.960 --> 01:48:43.320]  from then, I get temporary joint physical legal custody of my daughter. After being homeless at
[01:48:43.320 --> 01:48:50.280]  that point, then I get a job as a janitor, get a crappy one bedroom apartment and then ramp up to
[01:48:51.480 --> 01:48:58.600]  50% time with my daughter. But in the meantime, I got to say she packed my stuff up. I never got
[01:48:58.600 --> 01:49:04.200]  a choice on what I got. She packed up what she thought I should have. This is the standard deal
[01:49:04.200 --> 01:49:07.800]  designed to break up families. So you said it was a police day story. How did it end?
[01:49:09.720 --> 01:49:16.680]  Well, it ends with me going to trial, but I just got to say that, you know, I had my daughter for
[01:49:16.680 --> 01:49:23.480]  50% of the time and then I asked for temporary relief because they weren't making an offer to
[01:49:23.480 --> 01:49:28.440]  me to end the divorce. She makes $6,000 a month. I was making like $1,200.
[01:49:28.440 --> 01:49:31.320]  But you're a man. You got one minute. Finish it.
[01:49:31.320 --> 01:49:39.640]  Okay. So I was denied that then out of nowhere, she files a harassment restraining order on me
[01:49:39.640 --> 01:49:45.400]  for filming her at all of the exchanges and for sending co-parenting text messages.
[01:49:45.400 --> 01:49:48.920]  A harassment restraining order goes through and in there, they tell me I can't
[01:49:49.640 --> 01:49:54.680]  film her. They're violating my first member right. And I can't tell my story. I can't put the video
[01:49:54.680 --> 01:50:00.200]  up. So look, look, look, she's done the wrong thing ditching you and breaking the family up,
[01:50:00.200 --> 01:50:04.920]  which hurts your daughter. She needs to demonize you to feel good about what she's done.
[01:50:05.880 --> 01:50:10.520]  So I would just try to forgive her and say for the best thing of our daughter,
[01:50:10.520 --> 01:50:16.120]  you did this to me, you know, be nice to me. I mean, have you tried doing that with her?
[01:50:17.320 --> 01:50:20.760]  Oh, that's what the harassment thing was about. I was trying to co-parent and say,
[01:50:20.760 --> 01:50:23.560]  you know, let's work this out. Well, that means there's some, I mean,
[01:50:23.560 --> 01:50:27.240]  I know it's stacked against men. That's the new order. But I mean, how's it ending now?
[01:50:27.240 --> 01:50:33.960]  Now I haven't seen my daughter in three months because she took my daughter away from me on
[01:50:33.960 --> 01:50:40.280]  my parenting times and I asked why. So apparently I need to have supervised business. But it ended
[01:50:40.280 --> 01:50:44.440]  with me going to trial two weeks ago on my own because the attorney... How did it end? How did
[01:50:44.440 --> 01:50:51.000]  it end? We got 10 seconds. How did it end? I spanked them. I caught her lying on the stand.
[01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:57.400]  I, you know... Good. You fought the long haul. You beat her. You beat her? Yep. Good. Good. Good. Good.
[01:50:57.400 --> 01:51:03.080]  Good. We got to go. That's okay. This hour brought to you by infidelbodyarmor.com. When

[01:53:03.560 --> 01:53:08.440]  Not in America. This can't happen in America. Because I'm not concerned about our government,
[01:53:08.440 --> 01:53:13.800]  I was looking at survival stuff. I was raised as a Girl Scout and their motto was to be prepared.
[01:53:13.800 --> 01:53:19.880]  Food for Patriots was an opportunity for me to be able to put some things aside. I said,

[01:53:36.200 --> 01:53:41.320]  Plan on buying probably about four more of these minimums. And this came so quick,
[01:53:41.320 --> 01:53:45.240]  it came right when they said it was top. Thanks for supplying all this stuff for us,
[01:53:45.240 --> 01:53:48.520]  because I think we're all going to be needing it in a very short time.
[01:53:49.080 --> 01:53:52.840]  Join over 50,000 Americans who have trusted food for Patriots.
[01:53:52.840 --> 01:53:57.960]  Go to GetSurvivalFood.com to learn more. That's GetSurvivalFood.com.
[01:54:11.240 --> 01:54:15.960]  All right, let's go to your calls quickly now. Frank in North Carolina, you're on the air.
[01:54:15.960 --> 01:54:20.760]  And Phil, go ahead. I just thought a quick point I wanted to make using a couple of
[01:54:20.760 --> 01:54:27.560]  names, individuals that can be looked up very easily on YouTube. George W. Bush Appointee,
[01:54:27.560 --> 01:54:32.520]  Secretary of the Treasury, Paul O'Neill, and also the other one is Army General Westlake Clark.
[01:54:32.520 --> 01:54:39.960]  I'm pretty sure he's long retired now. But this Secretary of the Treasury, Paul O'Neill,
[01:54:39.960 --> 01:54:44.520]  he caught a bunch of flakware as an estimate on the cost of the Iraq War. I remember seeing that
[01:54:44.520 --> 01:54:48.760]  all over the news back during that time. And they basically found a way to push him out,
[01:54:48.760 --> 01:54:54.120]  got rid of him. I think he was in trouble about some other stuff that he was being honest. And
[01:54:54.120 --> 01:55:01.800]  of course, his estimate was actually quite conservative at the time. And, you know, it's
[01:55:01.800 --> 01:55:06.200]  so far surpassed and been too much. Well, yeah, they said that we would make the money back on
[01:55:06.200 --> 01:55:11.240]  oil and make money. And now it's been how many trillions of dollars? Right. But that's all.
[01:55:11.240 --> 01:55:14.920]  I don't have the figures. But now there's something else, though, and you can go on
[01:55:14.920 --> 01:55:20.280]  YouTube and watch this. I don't think it ever aired, but he did an interview with Leslie
[01:55:20.280 --> 01:55:25.800]  Stoll of 60 Minutes. I believe it was unair. But he stated that in the first cabinet meeting they
[01:55:25.800 --> 01:55:32.200]  had, now this was many months before 9-11, he said that they were told by George W. Bush
[01:55:32.840 --> 01:55:39.560]  that they were going into Iraq. No, no, I played that clip. He said this is before they even got
[01:55:39.560 --> 01:55:45.800]  in office. And he was president-elect, I believe, they had the maps up on the wall. No, I've seen
[01:55:45.800 --> 01:55:51.960]  the interview. George W. Bush ran, and I voted for him, too, by the way, not proud of it, but he
[01:55:51.960 --> 01:55:59.960]  ran on a non-enterventionist policy, foreign policy. Now, he knew that was a lie. Now, I know
[01:55:59.960 --> 01:56:05.080]  he's not the brains of, you know, the criminal group and whatnot, just like Obama obviously
[01:56:05.080 --> 01:56:09.320]  isn't because he doesn't have a whole lot in the way of brains. But Army General Wesley Clark,
[01:56:09.320 --> 01:56:12.840]  you can go look this up. You can watch it real quick. He said there was a plan to invade seven
[01:56:12.840 --> 01:56:17.880]  countries. He's done two interviews. We've played it. Yeah, he went and spoke with some of the people
[01:56:17.880 --> 01:56:21.640]  who used to work for him at the State Department and the Pentagon and whatnot. And they said,
[01:56:21.640 --> 01:56:26.680]  General, General, come here, we gotta tell you something. He said, not only are we going into
[01:56:26.680 --> 01:56:30.760]  Afghanistan, we're going into Iraq. And he said, Iraq, why are we going into Iraq? And he said,
[01:56:30.760 --> 01:56:34.200]  oh, it's much worse than that, General. We're going into all these other countries. What I'm
[01:56:34.200 --> 01:56:39.240]  saying is the U.S. military is used, they're thought of as dumb animals to be used as pawns.
[01:56:39.240 --> 01:56:42.760]  They decide what they're going to do, where they're going to go, where they're going to intervene,
[01:56:42.760 --> 01:56:47.960]  where they're going to invade and take over. And then they fabricate a story to justify,
[01:56:47.960 --> 01:56:54.520]  to provide a pretext to manipulate the sheeple to go along with it.
[01:56:54.520 --> 01:57:00.840]  No, that is exactly precisely what they do. And you basically quoted perfectly what Clark said.
[01:57:00.840 --> 01:57:06.600]  And it doesn't matter who we put in office, the Republican Democratic leadership is the same
[01:57:06.600 --> 01:57:10.920]  group. And you notice it just continues on. And it's not even to bring in an American
[01:57:10.920 --> 01:57:16.760]  empire or to put good governments in. It's to wreck and create destabilization. And of course,
[01:57:16.760 --> 01:57:21.240]  Henry Kissinger famously said military men are just dumb, stupid animals to be used as pawns
[01:57:21.240 --> 01:57:27.320]  and foreign policy. And that very well said caller, excellent call. Anything else?
[01:57:27.320 --> 01:57:33.480]  The thing is, I mean, I know it's painful to admit, but there is no noble cause in any of these
[01:57:33.480 --> 01:57:39.240]  wars were sold a bill of goods. It's all about deceiving, manipulating. It's all about control
[01:57:39.240 --> 01:57:43.320]  in the end. And I hate to say, I'm not saying there's not bravery, there's not courage amongst
[01:57:43.320 --> 01:57:49.240]  people in the military. But man, once you've done two or three, you know, enlistments,
[01:57:49.240 --> 01:57:54.120]  I mean, wake up and don't you know you're being used. There's no noble. Oh, no, they know you've
[01:57:54.120 --> 01:57:58.280]  woken up. So that's why you're public enemy number one. We're going to go to break, but let's go
[01:57:58.280 --> 01:58:02.840]  out with one of the clips of Wesley Clark on TV saying what he just said back to see him a few
[01:58:02.840 --> 01:58:07.720]  weeks later. And by that time we were bombing in Afghanistan, I said, are we still going to war
[01:58:07.720 --> 01:58:12.360]  with Iraq? And he said, Oh, it's worse than that. He said he reached over on his desk, he picked up
[01:58:12.360 --> 01:58:16.600]  a piece of paper. He said, I just, he said, I just got this down from upstairs meeting the
[01:58:16.600 --> 01:58:20.440]  Secretary of Defense office today. And he said, this is a memo that describes how we're going to
[01:58:20.440 --> 01:58:28.440]  take out seven countries in five years, starting with Iraq and then Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia,
[01:58:28.440 --> 01:58:33.960]  Sudan and finishing off Iran. We'll be right back, folks. Third hour coming up, your calls,
[01:58:33.960 --> 01:58:49.880]  special guests who's being censored. Part of this rain of censorship is going on. Stay with us.
[01:58:49.880 --> 01:58:54.040]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much,
[01:58:54.040 --> 01:59:00.120]  get healthy and detoxify. Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the
[01:59:00.120 --> 01:59:06.520]  world. Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid. I discovered
[01:59:06.520 --> 01:59:12.600]  a product being developed by Dr. Group. You now know it as survival shield, true nascent iodine
[01:59:12.600 --> 01:59:16.840]  that your body can really absorb. Then about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is
[01:59:16.840 --> 01:59:22.680]  powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals. And the results that I
[01:59:22.680 --> 01:59:29.320]  personally have had have been life changing. Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure
[01:59:29.320 --> 01:59:34.840]  crystals, ladies and gentlemen. This is innovating. And the best part is it helps fund infowars.com,
[01:59:34.840 --> 01:59:39.320]  the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation, promoting true libertarian ideas.

[01:59:55.480 --> 02:00:10.920]  Jones on the GCN radio network. Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You
[02:00:10.920 --> 02:00:20.040]  want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now live from Austin,
[02:00:20.040 --> 02:00:43.640]  Texas, Alex Jones. In February of this year, we reported that 50 Americans were fighting alongside
[02:00:43.640 --> 02:00:51.000]  Syrian rebels and Al Qaeda. Now, with the backing of Saudi money and US government money, they've
[02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:58.200]  grown. And their name is ISIS, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. They're taking over the country
[02:00:58.200 --> 02:01:04.040]  that we were supposed to help liberate. Inch by inch, mile by mile, head by head, ISIS is
[02:01:04.040 --> 02:01:11.160]  destroying everything that we fought for and mid-died for in Iraq. And this isn't the first time that
[02:01:11.160 --> 02:01:17.560]  our government has done this. Let's remember here, the people we are fighting today, we funded.
[02:01:17.560 --> 02:01:24.840]  I can't see fighting to impose Sharia law in Syria. I also can't see sending my son to fight with
[02:01:24.840 --> 02:01:31.320]  Islamic rebels against Christians. I also can't see my son going to fight without on the same
[02:01:31.320 --> 02:01:37.880]  side as Al Qaeda. There are so many ironies and unfortunate muddling nature to this that I can't
[02:01:37.880 --> 02:01:44.120]  see why we should get involved. So here's a list of different countries that we've gone into and
[02:01:44.120 --> 02:01:50.840]  supported terrorists. I found an interesting article on alternate.org titled 35 countries where the
[02:01:50.840 --> 02:01:58.280]  US has supported fascist drug lords and terrorists. Number one would be Afghanistan. After Mikhail
[02:01:58.280 --> 02:02:05.560]  Gorbachev withdrew Soviet forces in 1989, these US backed warlords tore the country apart and
[02:02:05.560 --> 02:02:12.200]  boosted opium production to an unprecedented level of 2000 to 3000 tons per year. The Taliban
[02:02:12.200 --> 02:02:20.120]  government cut opium production by 95 percent in two years between 1999 and 2001, but the US
[02:02:20.120 --> 02:02:26.840]  invasion in 2001 restored the warlords and drug lords power. And let's go recruit these Mujahideen
[02:02:26.840 --> 02:02:31.880]  and let's great. Let's get some to come from Saudi Arabia and other places importing their
[02:02:31.880 --> 02:02:38.280]  Wahhabi brand of Islam. Another country where America has supported terrorist activity would
[02:02:38.280 --> 02:02:44.440]  be Mexico. The death toll in Mexico's drug wars recently passed 100,000. The most violent of
[02:02:44.440 --> 02:02:50.360]  the drug cartels is Los Zetas. US officials call the Zetas the most technologically advanced,
[02:02:50.360 --> 02:02:57.080]  sophisticated and dangerous drug cartel operating in Mexico. The Zetas cartel was formed by Mexican
[02:02:57.080 --> 02:03:03.240]  security forces trained by US special forces at the school of the Americas and forbidding Georgia
[02:03:03.240 --> 02:03:09.960]  and at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. Another instance was in Nicaragua. Anastasia Somasa
[02:03:09.960 --> 02:03:16.200]  ruled Nicaragua for 43 years with unconditional US support and his National Guard committed
[02:03:16.200 --> 02:03:23.080]  every crime imaginable from massacres and torture to extortion and rape with complete impunity.
[02:03:23.080 --> 02:03:27.880]  The CIA recruited, trained and supported contra mercenaries to invade Nicaragua
[02:03:27.880 --> 02:03:32.600]  and conduct terrorism to destabilize the country. Well as you can see those are just a few examples
[02:03:32.600 --> 02:03:38.120]  of instances where our government has helped fund and back terrorists in different countries
[02:03:38.120 --> 02:03:41.960]  around the world. I encourage you to go check out that article. It's a really neat article.
[02:03:41.960 --> 02:04:03.320]  It talks about 35 countries that we've done that in. Look at it and form yourself and get educated.
[02:04:12.280 --> 02:04:15.320]  Where it should be on the nightly news tonight, I'm just going to leave it at that.
[02:04:15.320 --> 02:04:20.520]  So much of what doesn't get on the daytime radio show because of my incessant babbling
[02:04:23.160 --> 02:04:26.280]  does end up getting on the nightly news. In fact, that's why the nightly news is so
[02:04:26.280 --> 02:04:30.840]  incredibly vital. And of course more and more I'm hosting it or shooting pieces for it.
[02:04:30.840 --> 02:04:35.000]  You've seen the new studio. It's pretty nice and there's a lot more you haven't seen yet. So
[02:04:35.960 --> 02:04:40.680]  that's all getting phased in as we try to keep all the other things we're doing juggling in the
[02:04:40.680 --> 02:04:47.480]  air. All right, I'm going right to Phil, right to Phil when we come back, then Steve, then Jay,
[02:04:47.480 --> 02:04:53.640]  then Mike, then Fox. You be ready. I'm going to write to you on the other side of this break
[02:04:53.640 --> 02:05:02.360]  straight ahead. I'm Alex Jones of info wars.com. I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.

[02:06:01.640 --> 02:06:06.280]  the water supply in nine West Virginia counties. This year alone over 300,000 people in West
[02:06:06.280 --> 02:06:10.600]  Virginia had their drinking water contaminate. What are the health effects of having these

[02:06:15.160 --> 02:06:19.400]  My friend's water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and
[02:06:19.400 --> 02:06:23.720]  your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water. On average the county
[02:06:23.720 --> 02:06:28.920]  says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week. Few filters cut out the glyphosates that
[02:06:28.920 --> 02:06:34.840]  is found in water supplies worldwide. Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosalic
[02:06:34.840 --> 02:06:40.280]  acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate. All right, it is in teats and coffees and water and breads and
[02:06:40.280 --> 02:06:45.160]  toothpaste. It is our responsibility to protect our families. The establishment's not going to do it.

[02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:09.880]  more and more toxic each and every day, but it's not just the air outside that's toxic. Indoor
[02:07:09.880 --> 02:07:14.040]  air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even
[02:07:14.040 --> 02:07:19.480]  outdoor air and most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their
[02:07:19.480 --> 02:07:24.600]  homes. There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States. Well over a thousand types
[02:07:24.600 --> 02:07:29.640]  of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions and don't forget the fact that six million Americans
[02:07:29.640 --> 02:07:34.040]  live with pets they're allergic to as well. When I began to research these statistics it was clear
[02:07:34.040 --> 02:07:39.560]  to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we
[02:07:39.560 --> 02:07:44.680]  cannot escape but that we can fight back against made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and
[02:07:44.680 --> 02:07:50.120]  manufactured in the USA. The new info wars life lung cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle

[02:08:37.720 --> 02:08:41.960]  Shooter Jennings called the other day. He said I got a new album coming out soon.
[02:08:41.960 --> 02:08:50.200]  He courses the son of legendary outlaw country musician Waylon Jennings and I think he's just
[02:08:50.200 --> 02:08:57.560]  as good a musician as his father whether it's Rockabilly country or this type of music we're
[02:08:57.560 --> 02:09:02.600]  listening to right now that he collaborated on with Stephen King.

[02:09:26.520 --> 02:09:31.800]  caring about the general goodwill not using the claim that you care about it as an excuse to
[02:09:31.800 --> 02:09:37.560]  dominate and take over civilization. I want to go to your phone calls I've got one clip I want to
[02:09:37.560 --> 02:09:44.680]  play this just broken infowars.com. Paul Ryan to IRS commissioner nobody believes you and see
[02:09:45.640 --> 02:09:50.200]  after people like Ron Paul, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz get attacked and make it popular to ask real
[02:09:50.200 --> 02:09:57.640]  questions. Now people like Paul Ryan who I don't trust as far as I could throw him and Marco Rubio
[02:09:57.640 --> 02:10:02.920]  and Chris Christie and the rest of these people that have been double-crossed by Obama there's no
[02:10:02.920 --> 02:10:08.120]  honor among these people can come out and tell the truth because no one does believe them.
[02:10:08.120 --> 02:10:14.840]  7% approval rating for Congress they say a new low I saw one at six but it was nine. TV lowest
[02:10:14.840 --> 02:10:20.920]  approval rating in Gallup people don't trust mainstream so in this NBC can say I'm a racist
[02:10:20.920 --> 02:10:27.960]  and a criminal and a terrorist with no proof please. They'd be like Jeffrey Dahmer saying I'm a bad
[02:10:27.960 --> 02:10:36.040]  guy because I'm calling him out. Ted Bundy I mean I don't care and again it's not that I'm on some
[02:10:36.040 --> 02:10:44.200]  goody-to-shoes high horse. It's that you people are a pack of scum and I am not gonna be in league
[02:10:44.200 --> 02:10:50.280]  with you. You call me whatever names you want your time's coming to an end now here's the rest of
[02:10:50.280 --> 02:10:54.840]  the story. We've got to decide what we're gonna do and try to have a moral society. Doesn't mean
[02:10:54.840 --> 02:10:59.960]  that the general rot won't still continue just because the system the people at the top who are
[02:10:59.960 --> 02:11:05.560]  the worst are now exposed. We have to be better men and women. I'm gonna stop preaching right there.
[02:11:05.560 --> 02:11:10.680]  Let's go to this clip and then Obama considers airstrikes in Syria on terrorists he previously
[02:11:10.680 --> 02:11:18.360]  supported. See I won't bomb Iraq where my Al Qaeda are invading but I will attack Syria to fight the
[02:11:18.360 --> 02:11:22.680]  people we put in there but it won't even really be them it'll be the Syrian government or something
[02:11:22.680 --> 02:11:27.560]  because they know the average person doesn't know a Sunni from a Shiite, doesn't know a Syrian from
[02:11:27.560 --> 02:11:34.680]  a Kurd, doesn't know a hedge from a hole in the ground. Total ignorance 2 plus 2 equals 5 common
[02:11:34.680 --> 02:11:41.240]  core. They want the next generation to be so stupid even dumber than they are now. Let's go
[02:11:41.240 --> 02:11:49.080]  to this Paul Ryan clip with a new IRS commissioner. I don't I don't believe you this is incredible.
[02:11:50.360 --> 02:11:54.440]  I have a long career that's the first time anybody has said that you're not believe me I'm
[02:11:54.440 --> 02:11:58.200]  actually I don't believe you that's fine we can have a disagreement I'm willing to stand on our
[02:11:58.200 --> 02:12:04.360]  record I'm willing to remind you that it was not buried in 27 pages most of that 27 pages is exhibits
[02:12:04.360 --> 02:12:10.280]  when asked about the custodians we advise you coming which we knew for one day being forthcoming
[02:12:10.280 --> 02:12:14.760]  is to say I'm sorry you know what investigators congress who's investigating we let him answer
[02:12:14.760 --> 02:12:19.480]  the question I didn't ask him a question yes you did for gentlemen the gentleman
[02:12:20.840 --> 02:12:28.600]  I get a little time I control time I realize that disrupting a hearing uh sort of no come on
[02:12:28.600 --> 02:12:33.800]  no no people but the gentleman from Wisconsin I am not yielding time I control the time he has a
[02:12:33.800 --> 02:12:40.360]  time here here's what being forthcoming is regular order if we are investigating criminal wrongdoing
[02:12:40.360 --> 02:12:46.040]  targeting of people based on their political beliefs and the emails in question are lost
[02:12:46.040 --> 02:12:51.320]  because of a hard drive crash that is apparently unrecoverable which a lot of it professionals
[02:12:51.320 --> 02:12:56.920]  will question and you don't tell us about it until we asked you about it that is not being
[02:12:56.920 --> 02:13:01.560]  forthcoming and that's I you I yield back to balance my time that's not true our gentleman
[02:13:01.560 --> 02:13:08.440]  yields back the our gentleman has yielded back his time thank you by the way I mean look at the
[02:13:08.440 --> 02:13:16.040]  iris commissioner acting like he's outraged when that snake demon takes old ladies houses 24 7 and
[02:13:16.040 --> 02:13:22.280]  people's wedding rings to feed it into the big mega banks that are tax exempt in banker bailouts
[02:13:22.280 --> 02:13:28.040]  they get it coming and going and then act like by the way they don't save them on her hard drive
[02:13:28.040 --> 02:13:33.800]  the emails unless you save them there are on the servers and under federal law they're all
[02:13:33.800 --> 02:13:40.120]  saved and they're there just like fast and furious it's all lies and then he sits there and says
[02:13:40.120 --> 02:13:48.680]  that's not true just like his predecessor got caught lying what a sick joke and again Paul
[02:13:48.680 --> 02:13:54.520]  Ryan's not the worst up there of the neocons and of the rhinos but I mean I'm just sick of it you
[02:13:54.520 --> 02:13:59.960]  know him acting like he's the good boy you know professional athlete or skier or whatever and
[02:13:59.960 --> 02:14:03.800]  you know he's more like Eddie Haskell or something but finally they're being forced
[02:14:03.800 --> 02:14:08.440]  by real patriots to ask real questions see we're going to radicalize the republican party
[02:14:08.440 --> 02:14:11.880]  we're going to force them to cover all issues I'm going to shut up now fill in New York you're a
[02:14:11.880 --> 02:14:17.400]  trooper for holding thanks for calling in you're on the air go ahead hi there I thought we maybe
[02:14:17.400 --> 02:14:23.800]  should take take the battle to them in small ways Hillary is going to have a book signing and
[02:14:23.800 --> 02:14:30.920]  and Chapaquah Connecticut any anybody can go I guess it's on Greeley Avenue in Chapaquah and
[02:14:30.920 --> 02:14:37.400]  it's going to be on the 29th of this month another way of maybe taking this to the enemy is having a
[02:14:37.400 --> 02:14:42.520]  card campaign showing the different parts of the country that just fed up with these people
[02:14:42.520 --> 02:14:47.960]  sent it to their business address their personal address Hillary lives on the old house lane if
[02:14:47.960 --> 02:14:55.080]  they want to send it to Chapaquah good old Henry Kissinger lives in South Kent on Henderson Drive
[02:14:55.080 --> 02:15:02.280]  if they want to send him a few messages but make it polite make it not a nasty but just get
[02:15:02.280 --> 02:15:08.200]  give them a point that look we've had enough of them well I totally agree with you Hillary is in
[02:15:08.200 --> 02:15:14.920]  Austin Texas today and a lot of times they sell tickets to get in but the press should be there
[02:15:14.920 --> 02:15:20.920]  and we'll see what happens on the not only news tonight but gee I don't know and of course on
[02:15:20.920 --> 02:15:30.360]  the Sunday show but but everywhere she goes people should go in they should ask questions about what
[02:15:30.360 --> 02:15:37.160]  do you mean the promotion of the Second Amendmentist terrorism what do you mean you know what
[02:15:37.160 --> 02:15:41.480]  differences Benghazi make and they should be under siege everywhere they're already talking
[02:15:41.480 --> 02:15:47.640]  about her not running because she's so unpopular and focused creeps with Democrats okay I mean I
[02:15:47.640 --> 02:15:52.520]  hope she runs I mean she is a disgusting witch and it'll totally blow up in their face and it isn't
[02:15:52.520 --> 02:15:57.400]  that I think the Republican presidential candidate whoever gets it will save us it's that it's all
[02:15:57.400 --> 02:16:06.520]  about a rejection of the Clinton crime network and so yes everywhere she goes people with focused
[02:16:06.520 --> 02:16:11.880]  serious questions and then if a security guard walks up like you've done something wrong be calm
[02:16:11.880 --> 02:16:16.840]  and say hey man it's America I'm asking a question here you know so many times with the police and
[02:16:16.840 --> 02:16:21.880]  bureaucrats they're not even so much bad people it's that our body language is like we've done
[02:16:21.880 --> 02:16:26.520]  something wrong and you know a cop charges up to me for asking a question I go hey man
[02:16:27.480 --> 02:16:32.360]  it's the press conference or it's a question and answer and I want America wants that answered
[02:16:32.360 --> 02:16:37.320]  is it not an American value to go out and ask this question and if they say then leave leave but
[02:16:38.360 --> 02:16:45.480]  we all need to get out of our comfort zones and all of us just have a buddy go with a little flip
[02:16:45.480 --> 02:16:51.320]  phone or their iPhone videotape you ask him the question put it on YouTube say you're not technical
[02:16:51.320 --> 02:16:56.360]  like me have somebody that is show you how to upload stuff to YouTube I mean I've been doing that for
[02:16:56.360 --> 02:17:03.080]  you know by myself for since YouTube came out and I say I'm not technical I've gotten pretty
[02:17:03.080 --> 02:17:07.000]  technical over the years just learning to get stuff done myself when I work by myself on the
[02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:12.600]  weekend people see me upload videos sometimes from the road or you know while I'm cooking eggs for
[02:17:12.600 --> 02:17:20.280]  the kids because it's always a war I mean it's because freedom isn't free and and now the final
[02:17:20.280 --> 02:17:26.680]  phase of evil is here we better stand up against the great points anything else fill one last point
[02:17:26.680 --> 02:17:32.520]  I think we should call up the advertisers of the New York Times and tell them look they should boy
[02:17:32.520 --> 02:17:37.560]  boycott the New York Times until they put discuses list on there they they don't they don't have a
[02:17:37.560 --> 02:17:42.840]  right to to deprive him of his rightful place on the list well I mean it just shows the New
[02:17:42.840 --> 02:17:47.720]  York Times is a fraud I mean who wants to read a paper or go see a race where it's rigged I mean
[02:17:47.720 --> 02:17:52.920]  that's why Don King ruined professional boxing and and cut back to profits because people knew it
[02:17:52.920 --> 02:17:57.560]  was rigged and and and I mean what is the New York Times doing rigging the New York Times best
[02:17:57.560 --> 02:18:01.720]  seller list discrediting themselves that's why they're going out of business I mean that's the
[02:18:01.720 --> 02:18:07.560]  answer just just do not read them I hear you I mean it just it's a total joke let's go to Steve

[02:18:24.440 --> 02:18:30.920]  up blood every night uh and he can't even get in to see the VA yeah I mean he got shot in the
[02:18:30.920 --> 02:18:36.200]  shoulder in Vietnam and I mean they they won't even you know I'm it's a shame I mean they're
[02:18:36.200 --> 02:18:40.600]  treating these illegal immigrants like they're royalty well they are well dude they're gonna
[02:18:40.600 --> 02:18:45.000]  take our guns oh yeah the Democratic voters are gonna take your guns my guns take our rights

[02:18:58.200 --> 02:19:04.840]  documents that were for Ben Laden they were training documents back in and uh I think was the 70s

[02:19:10.040 --> 02:19:16.600]  in the CIA declassified was Tim Osmond and it was all stages sorry rabie he just took the blame
[02:19:16.600 --> 02:19:21.080]  he had nothing to do with it folks he was there organizing terror groups but he wasn't actually

[02:19:27.480 --> 02:19:30.440]  folks know that Sebel Edmonds and others but I've talked to other whistleblowers and
[02:19:31.320 --> 02:19:35.080]  you know the point is is that people don't go public there's no point even talking about it
[02:19:35.080 --> 02:19:40.840]  but it's Saudi Arabia it's a big joke the shanks and people party you know here in Austin you know
[02:19:40.840 --> 02:19:47.080]  Saudi princes they just brag about it all their whole plan and they think it's funny uh so uh yeah

[02:25:14.120 --> 02:25:22.520]  republicans is as bad as some of the things they do uh are the democrats are cancer and and and the
[02:25:22.520 --> 02:25:27.240]  republicans were acting like this i would be for the democrats i mean the democrats are going
[02:25:27.240 --> 02:25:33.880]  for it all right now and but i know i hear your point on bob bar and that was 11 years ago
[02:25:35.080 --> 02:25:38.040]  and now he'll have more libertarian support to not be for things like that
[02:25:39.400 --> 02:25:41.640]  and i absolutely hear what you're saying i think it's very legitimate
[02:25:41.640 --> 02:25:49.720]  okay the other point i have for you alex is i talked to yuppies in hong kong right i i talked to
[02:25:50.520 --> 02:26:00.760]  overseas americans um many of them are complacent i talked to them about 9 11 i talked to them about
[02:26:00.760 --> 02:26:08.520]  mh3 70 which you're one of the few media sources that have really done justice to that story and
[02:26:08.520 --> 02:26:15.320]  provided the plows of explanation for what went down um how do i get them to understand that that
[02:26:15.320 --> 02:26:22.040]  in iraq and the financial meltdown are all connected i mean they'll they'll complain about
[02:26:22.040 --> 02:26:28.680]  the federal government coming after their bank accounts and under fat guy but they don't see
[02:26:28.680 --> 02:26:33.240]  how it's all connected i mean people this is how it's connected you have different governing
[02:26:33.240 --> 02:26:38.920]  philosophies there's been a lot of different systems throughout history there's been the
[02:26:38.920 --> 02:26:44.120]  mercantile french systems and there's been the venetian black nobility and uh their economic
[02:26:44.120 --> 02:26:48.760]  systems there's been fascism and communism what we have now is a form of corporatism
[02:26:49.880 --> 02:26:57.960]  or train wreckism requerism where it's kind of like corrupt lawyers will play off against their
[02:26:57.960 --> 02:27:05.240]  clients if you got bad lawyers and keep the you know the fight in divorce or whatever the case is
[02:27:05.240 --> 02:27:13.400]  going as long as possible the system milking humanity even as the whole system collapses
[02:27:13.400 --> 02:27:18.680]  like max keiser calls them suicide bankers who are still doing trades as the world trade centers
[02:27:18.680 --> 02:27:25.960]  collapsed and one of them made 15 million dollars in 10 minutes but he was dead so it's a mentality
[02:27:25.960 --> 02:27:32.280]  of not having wisdom they only have knowledge and so if people don't know how things are connected
[02:27:33.560 --> 02:27:38.760]  fema did a horrible job at katrina they got their funding massively increased people don't get in
[02:27:38.760 --> 02:27:44.440]  trouble or fired or indicted for doing really bad stuff in government and corporations what does it do
[02:27:44.440 --> 02:27:52.760]  in emboldens so there is a culture of wrecking things because they get to manage the wrecking
[02:27:52.760 --> 02:27:58.920]  and pick the winners and losers like obama flooding the borders openly to collapse local law enforcement
[02:27:58.920 --> 02:28:04.440]  to bring in dhs to get more funding to deal with the crisis and then they'll just legalize almost
[02:28:04.440 --> 02:28:10.520]  all these people and do a few show deportations uh and if someone can't understand that they're
[02:28:10.520 --> 02:28:16.040]  gonna you understand it real soon but now congress is coming out saying senator sessions and others
[02:28:16.040 --> 02:28:21.480]  it's staged and explaining how banners coming out now saying it's staged and explaining how it is
[02:28:21.480 --> 02:28:28.440]  because we're being forced to because we're going to lose everything i've described kleptocratic
[02:28:28.440 --> 02:28:36.600]  socialism and crony capitalism as cancer it doesn't have a consciousness and these globalists think
[02:28:36.600 --> 02:28:43.400]  they've got things figured out but they're like cancer they just keep growing and growing and growing
[02:28:43.400 --> 02:28:48.680]  and they're going to kill the body politic they're not symbiotic i'm not up here on some
[02:28:48.680 --> 02:28:52.680]  high horse claiming government's got to be perfect and everything's going to be great but i mean you
[02:28:52.680 --> 02:28:59.800]  know for god's sakes they're training the police excuse me i don't mean to excuse me lord for heaven's
[02:28:59.800 --> 02:29:04.920]  sakes they're training police all over the country to shoot homeless people in the back
[02:29:05.480 --> 02:29:09.560]  and when they do it they don't even get reprimanded and i'm not even attacking the police
[02:29:10.200 --> 02:29:14.280]  the point is do the cops want to live in a world like that where that could happen to their kids and
[02:29:14.280 --> 02:29:21.240]  it does see that's the issue is we've got to realize everything we do is connected to somebody else
[02:29:22.120 --> 02:29:29.000]  and so really bad people are getting in control and as things get more decadent more and more are
[02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:34.840]  and so we're racing to the bottom so if you're yucky friends don't want to wake up that's because
[02:29:34.840 --> 02:29:40.120]  subconsciously they feel overpowered they feel inadequate so they just want to say it's not
[02:29:40.120 --> 02:29:46.280]  true well okay then just tell them to get in the ditch and die you move on we'll be back

[02:35:39.320 --> 02:35:43.880]  in an article i called the lawyer up on the number and i said how many of these you send out a week
[02:35:43.880 --> 02:35:49.240]  he was about a hundred and i said you're violating my first amendment you know full well i've arrived
[02:35:49.240 --> 02:35:54.760]  to say taser in a headline of an article and he said mr jones i know who you are just forget the
[02:35:54.760 --> 02:35:59.640]  call and uh just don't worry about it we know you have a right to do that we just send a lot of these

[02:36:14.040 --> 02:36:19.880]  an example of what goes on in this country so you know it's a fraud and i called up their lawyer
[02:36:19.880 --> 02:36:26.680]  of this company that does work for apple and i said uh i want to see the proof that we downloaded
[02:36:26.680 --> 02:36:31.640]  that illegally because we have it all purchased and uh you're probably violating the law too if you
[02:36:31.640 --> 02:36:38.520]  got spyware that claims we uh we stole it so that's a whole another issue of you you're scanning
[02:36:38.520 --> 02:36:43.800]  our machines i want to see your your proof and he said no no no we're going to take you off the
[02:36:43.800 --> 02:36:48.200]  list we send thousands of these out every few months uh you know just be careful what your
[02:36:48.200 --> 02:36:52.920]  people are doing i said we we have systems on it that scan for that people are fired to download
[02:36:53.480 --> 02:37:00.920]  any any proprietary music or um you know software stuff like that i said this is a shakedown
[02:37:00.920 --> 02:37:05.480]  they have another deal where you you'll show a shot of a news article or or even have it embedded
[02:37:05.480 --> 02:37:12.920]  in a in a message board where it's embedded link where it's embeddable in a tweet put out by major
[02:37:12.920 --> 02:37:18.680]  newspapers and then they threaten to sue you or sue you and then you just go to court and go it's
[02:37:18.680 --> 02:37:23.720]  an embedded tweet they made it embeddable and then the court goes uh yeah you gotta pay his lawyers
[02:37:23.720 --> 02:37:30.680]  fee still gotta jack with it but see the general public doesn't deal with this they don't run a
[02:37:30.680 --> 02:37:39.240]  media company they don't know the shakedowns that's what they are shakedowns the average person
[02:37:39.240 --> 02:37:43.640]  that's who they send them to has a little website or whatever it's some lady that has a dog rescue
[02:37:43.640 --> 02:37:49.320]  we've had on about stuff you know the newspaper coming after or it's a disabled veterans group
[02:37:49.320 --> 02:37:53.400]  we had on this happened to i mean this is going on and you need to know folks just just say send
[02:37:53.400 --> 02:37:57.560]  you a letter threatening to sue you or whatever you need to call them up and get in their face about
[02:37:57.560 --> 02:38:01.560]  it that's my view i'm not giving legal advice most lawyers don't know what they're doing or a milk
[02:38:01.560 --> 02:38:06.120]  you and you make you spend $50,000 fighting something that doesn't exist that's why you
[02:38:06.120 --> 02:38:11.400]  gotta get real lawyers there's one guy exposed that his name is michelin i forget his first name
[02:38:11.400 --> 02:38:15.720]  we've had him on the show we need to get him back on about this he's a real lawyer who just goes
[02:38:15.720 --> 02:38:20.680]  i'm not even gonna charge yet people we've sent to him i'm so sick of this i'm a copyright lawyer
[02:38:20.680 --> 02:38:24.760]  and i sue real people that have really violated copyright and they're making us all look bad
[02:38:25.320 --> 02:38:28.440]  i mean that's the kind of good lawyer who does honorable stuff makes money
[02:38:29.320 --> 02:38:33.000]  goes out of people that are really violating copyright copyrights copying everybody's music
[02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:38.040]  and then selling it for copyrights taking somebody's program and then bootlegging it
[02:38:38.040 --> 02:38:44.600]  it's not just send us money or we're gonna sue you now i like under armor and that's why we've
[02:38:44.600 --> 02:38:50.200]  got infant old body armor coming on dot com but it shows how copyright under syspa and sopa and
[02:38:50.200 --> 02:38:55.720]  these new un treaties and this new international asia pacific union treaty that leaked that obama
[02:38:55.720 --> 02:39:00.360]  is trying to get ratified without the public seeing there's 33 parts only one part's been
[02:39:00.360 --> 02:39:06.200]  two parts been released i'm just giving you a background here that just says you violate copyright
[02:39:06.200 --> 02:39:11.880]  three times on the internet companies claim you lose your web id you can never get on the internet
[02:39:11.880 --> 02:39:18.520]  again and you're gonna ret to scan our thumbprint to be able to get on the internet that's the end
[02:39:18.520 --> 02:39:23.160]  of freedom of speeches we know it it's beyond the chinese style net censorship and that's what
[02:39:23.160 --> 02:39:28.040]  the democrats are promoting right now again i'm not siding with the republicans the democrats
[02:39:28.040 --> 02:39:33.400]  are quarterbacking everything right now well i'm gonna let him give you the details and hopefully
[02:39:33.400 --> 02:39:36.920]  it's a mistake by a lawyer but i don't think it is i remember seeing a 60 minutes piece about the
[02:39:36.920 --> 02:39:43.480]  mcdonald lords the mcdonald's lords in scotland who don't get lordly money for hundreds of years
[02:39:43.480 --> 02:39:48.280]  so they got a castle they rented out people to stay in and for hundreds of years it's got a pub
[02:39:48.280 --> 02:39:55.400]  and a restaurant that people tourists and others go to eat at and drink it now it predates mcdonald's
[02:39:55.400 --> 02:40:00.680]  being founded in the 50s by over a couple hundred years mcdonald's remember just kept assuming the
[02:40:00.680 --> 02:40:08.680]  mcdonald's family because they had a restaurant at mcdonald's castle the restaurant wasn't even
[02:40:08.680 --> 02:40:14.680]  called mcdonald's it was at mcdonald's castle now they did that really because the family
[02:40:14.680 --> 02:40:18.840]  probably could have come after mcdonald's but they'd been operating for 50 something years so it
[02:40:18.840 --> 02:40:24.840]  didn't matter when mcdonald's did that so obviously the two don't compete with each other and i get
[02:40:24.840 --> 02:40:30.120]  these letters all the time you know saying uh we own the word free speech you can't have it in
[02:40:30.120 --> 02:40:35.880]  corporations name or blah blah blah let's go good sue me by the way go check these precedents i don't
[02:40:35.880 --> 02:40:40.680]  say this on there but i send them over law cases we've won and judgments and i go i don't really
[02:40:40.680 --> 02:40:47.720]  want to get a judgment on you and get attorney's fees and time uh maybe you got in-house lawyers
[02:40:47.720 --> 02:40:53.000]  so they don't care but move on to weaker targets i'm sure you've got some old ladies to shake down
[02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:57.960]  you can scare the hell out of and you know get a bunch of money out of by the way you're gonna go
[02:40:57.960 --> 02:41:03.160]  to hell you know what i mean just like the irs and all the rest of these parasites but i talk to
[02:41:03.160 --> 02:41:07.080]  these lawyers like this they didn't happen that often now but every few weeks i gotta get on the
[02:41:07.080 --> 02:41:12.040]  phone call lawyer up and you know just go man you sleep good at night you and your company now i
[02:41:12.040 --> 02:41:18.600]  don't want to demonize in uh under armor yet but we've got the fellow on he is a sponsor but he
[02:41:18.600 --> 02:41:22.520]  isn't on about that right now just to briefly talk about this that i want to go back to your calls
[02:41:22.520 --> 02:41:26.280]  mike fox jordy and peter we're gonna get to you here when our guest leaves us
[02:41:27.240 --> 02:41:31.240]  chad cooper is ceo and fiddle body armor becomes a successful american company veteran police
[02:41:31.240 --> 02:41:35.400]  officer veteran us air force staff sergeant worked five years in the nsa we gotta get him
[02:41:35.400 --> 02:41:40.920]  talk about that worked under uh another four as a defense contractor with time in the middle east
[02:41:40.920 --> 02:41:46.360]  and far east sorry fiddle body armor in 2012 it's already become very successful being sponsored
[02:41:46.360 --> 02:41:51.240]  here first to fill the need to supply civilian patriots and preppers with the armor and other
[02:41:51.240 --> 02:41:55.720]  tactical products they need to resist tyranny and keep their family safe well he's gotten a letter
[02:41:56.520 --> 02:42:00.200]  saying you can't have the word armor under armors underwear and clothes
[02:42:01.080 --> 02:42:04.760]  i like it as exercise clothes and shoes i'm gonna tell you though they come after him
[02:42:04.760 --> 02:42:10.120]  but the first amendment i'll quit wearing it okay i mean it's real simple very popular brand
[02:42:10.120 --> 02:42:15.080]  you know protect those houses or slogan armor there are hundreds of body armor companies
[02:42:15.080 --> 02:42:21.880]  hundreds that have the word armor in their name armors go back thousands of years body armor i
[02:42:21.880 --> 02:42:27.720]  mean i guarantee without even calling my lawyer they have not it's called a slap suit folks if they
[02:42:27.720 --> 02:42:35.560]  sue infidel body armor if under armor does that with their underwear and the rest of it
[02:42:36.600 --> 02:42:41.800]  there's no free speech in this country and and and they're trying to say you can't even name
[02:42:41.800 --> 02:42:46.520]  your business mickey's burgers because it's the first word in mickey mouths but that's been defeated
[02:42:46.520 --> 02:42:50.520]  as well these lawyers and these companies are destroying free speech because the public's
[02:42:50.520 --> 02:42:56.360]  ignorant of it that's why we're here to talk about this and to discuss it i mean taser tries to tell
[02:42:56.360 --> 02:43:01.320]  me i can't say the word taser they own that word no you don't i can't operate a business with that
[02:43:01.320 --> 02:43:09.160]  name okay and it needs to be reversed so just briefly tell us specifically what's happening
[02:43:09.160 --> 02:43:15.160]  to you over there i mean i tell us what the letter says you wanted to break this here
[02:43:15.160 --> 02:43:21.720]  i think it's interesting just in the larger gestalt of how they'll use a copyright now
[02:43:22.280 --> 02:43:27.480]  on youtube if we show a newspaper with a photo in it and then i have to threaten lawsuits or file
[02:43:27.480 --> 02:43:32.920]  lawsuits i mean that's the kind of stuff i've had to do behind the scenes so this is an ongoing
[02:43:32.920 --> 02:43:39.640]  attack on free speech but but also on your right to commerce i mean if body armor isn't body armor
[02:43:39.640 --> 02:43:43.880]  but underwear can take the name of the hundreds of companies that call it armor we don't have a
[02:43:43.880 --> 02:43:49.720]  language left sir yeah that's exactly what it is armor you know by its truest definition is
[02:43:49.720 --> 02:43:53.880]  goes back hundreds and probably thousands of years like you mentioned and in its truest sense
[02:43:53.880 --> 02:43:59.720]  it's designed to protect against uh sharp edge weapons and projectiles and that's by definition
[02:43:59.720 --> 02:44:05.880]  what we do what they do uh you know no offense to their product is i personally i own a couple of
[02:44:06.680 --> 02:44:10.840]  under armor products and and they're great for working out but it's not really armor but their
[02:44:10.840 --> 02:44:16.200]  lawyers are way out of control and need to have their pants pulled down and spanked well about
[02:44:16.200 --> 02:44:23.240]  a month and a half ago i was contacted by uh under armor's lawyers and they sent a letter
[02:44:23.240 --> 02:44:28.440]  challenging our copyright i mean excuse me our trademark and our trademark is infidel body armor
[02:44:28.440 --> 02:44:33.640]  and they said not under armor totally separate totally different products totally different
[02:44:33.640 --> 02:44:38.360]  spelling they spell there for the british spelling ours is the american spelling but it's body armor
[02:44:38.360 --> 02:44:43.720]  not sports equipment and uh no athletic shorts and things like that but basically they've got
[02:44:43.720 --> 02:44:49.640]  this army of lawyers who have to justify their existence it seems like and and come up with
[02:44:49.640 --> 02:44:53.960]  ways to protect their company and you know stay in business and what they did was they
[02:44:53.960 --> 02:45:00.520]  sent me five demands they basically want me to stop using my mark anywhere other than on the
[02:45:00.520 --> 02:45:06.360]  t-shirt that i'm wearing right now uh they're afraid that people are going to be confused
[02:45:06.920 --> 02:45:12.520]  between infidel body armor and under armor and uh did you hear about apartment complexes in
[02:45:12.520 --> 02:45:17.400]  houston and tell people no american flags it may upset muslims this sounds politically correct to
[02:45:17.400 --> 02:45:23.640]  me uh i mean i mean this this is a real joke i mean you know you they're trying to protect their
[02:45:23.640 --> 02:45:30.280]  made up trademark i'm trying to protect the first amendment here well exactly that that's
[02:45:30.280 --> 02:45:36.200]  what it is you know it comes down to is there an infringement uh on their mark and and they
[02:45:36.200 --> 02:45:41.480]  need to protect their mark i understand that there's there's a reason for them doing this
[02:45:41.480 --> 02:45:47.320]  but on the other hand there's some this is really frivolous and uh i don't i really
[02:45:47.320 --> 02:45:52.440]  really don't know what to do um other than well i mean have you gotten a lot of trademark
[02:45:52.440 --> 02:45:55.640]  lawyer because i mean i've i've got and i'm not going to give you advice but i know what they would
[02:45:55.640 --> 02:46:01.400]  tell me uh you know this is a different business this is a different area uh you're you're you're
[02:46:01.400 --> 02:46:07.160]  attempting by threats to engage in torturous interference of our business operations uh and
[02:46:07.160 --> 02:46:14.040]  if you do engage uh in uh you know baritry against this operation you'll be held libel uh you know
[02:46:14.040 --> 02:46:19.000]  the courts are apt to rule according to these 14 case laws in similar areas that you're going to
[02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:23.560]  be held libel for attorney's fees and damage to our name and and then they'll move on to other
[02:46:23.560 --> 02:46:29.400]  targets yeah and that's what we've done we we replied uh we i did have to hire a uh trademark
[02:46:29.400 --> 02:46:34.280]  attorney and and we did the letter but really i think what would happen would be really good
[02:46:34.280 --> 02:46:40.520]  is if people called and said hey under armor leave body leave infidel alone and you know if
[02:46:40.520 --> 02:46:46.680]  if enough people did something like that and called to complain um what would happen is they would call
[02:46:46.680 --> 02:46:51.960]  their attorneys off and you know i think it would not only help me out but it would help other
[02:46:52.760 --> 02:46:55.400]  companies out because like you said they're doing this every day they probably send out
[02:46:55.400 --> 02:46:59.720]  hundreds of these letters a day challenging body armor companies in any company that has the word
[02:46:59.720 --> 02:47:05.240]  armor in it yeah and again this may be a mistake by then i i'm not saying they're involved in
[02:47:05.240 --> 02:47:09.960]  baritry i'm not saying they're bad people i personally this is one of my hot buttons now
[02:47:10.520 --> 02:47:13.880]  not not with under armor but with these companies that have done this to me
[02:47:14.600 --> 02:47:18.600]  and and you know you call the lawyer up you go man you want me to have a lawyer spend money to
[02:47:18.600 --> 02:47:25.320]  respond to you that you know that's almost a form of theft that you know that this is a pure threat
[02:47:25.320 --> 02:47:30.920]  and even if you sue me you're hoping i'm ignorant and you're literally engaged in a form of highway
[02:47:30.920 --> 02:47:36.840]  piracy and i'm just tired of it and again if somebody was putting out clothing that had
[02:47:37.880 --> 02:47:43.560]  armor in the name i don't even know if that if it wasn't the exact same name i just think
[02:47:43.560 --> 02:47:49.160]  this copyright thing has gone way too far yeah they went after a beverage company recently i think
[02:47:49.160 --> 02:47:54.040]  it was i can't remember the exact name of it but i had the word armor in it and they went after them
[02:47:54.040 --> 02:48:00.760]  and i believe they won i don't know how they they they did that but uh you know the the courts
[02:48:00.760 --> 02:48:08.280]  perpetuate this and we've become a very litigious society where people feel entitled to sue on every
[02:48:08.280 --> 02:48:12.760]  little turn left you know anywhere they go they think they can sue and they're entitled to sue
[02:48:12.760 --> 02:48:17.480]  and the attorneys are making money on this left hand over fist you know both sides and so my big
[02:48:17.480 --> 02:48:21.640]  issue again is the first amendment and it turns out they promote duck dynasty clothing and stuff
[02:48:21.640 --> 02:48:26.120]  because they know it's popular to make money and i know they've they've they've marketed libertarian
[02:48:26.120 --> 02:48:31.160]  sportsmen patriots i think this is a major pr issue for them and it's important this is usual
[02:48:31.160 --> 02:48:37.000]  to spank them uh infidel body armor dot com and we appreciate your sponsorship and your fine products
[02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:41.960]  uh thank you so much for your time chad cooper i appreciate it thank you alex you bet and then
[02:48:41.960 --> 02:48:46.280]  we'll get an update and see what unfolds from this all right take care oh they do the right thing and
[02:48:46.280 --> 02:48:50.520]  leave you alone and don't like you know try to take our youtube video down i mean these companies
[02:48:50.520 --> 02:48:56.520]  either the right thing or they double down and again i have nothing against under armor it's
[02:48:56.520 --> 02:49:00.680]  just now when i put it on because i got a lot of their clothing and like their swimsuits
[02:49:00.680 --> 02:49:06.280]  i don't want to wear it anymore just because of this and and i want them to back off so it's just
[02:49:06.280 --> 02:49:12.040]  irritating i just i'm tired of it you don't own infidel body armor name been around i mean it
[02:49:12.040 --> 02:49:16.520]  makes me want to throw up and the ignorant public doesn't know this stuff it is starting to believe
[02:49:16.520 --> 02:49:20.520]  it which is what the lawyers want mike in alabama thanks for holding her on the air
[02:49:22.120 --> 02:49:29.400]  hey alex uh simplify but i wanted to call you about 20 years ago i've got a friend his dad spent
[02:49:29.400 --> 02:49:36.520]  27 years and uh in the uh special forces and he told us back then they'd been told in a briefing
[02:49:37.160 --> 02:49:41.640]  that eventually the borders would be watered down or just a symbol to the point that
[02:49:41.640 --> 02:49:46.840]  it floods of illegal immigrants would be coming across the mexican border not just mexicans
[02:49:47.480 --> 02:49:55.160]  but from all over south america when was this this was the early 90s now and i didn't think much
[02:49:55.160 --> 02:50:00.760]  about it then you know but seeing what's going on now it recalled that i said oh man he was right
[02:50:00.760 --> 02:50:06.520]  they you know and these people knew about that then because they had told them in briefings about it
[02:50:06.520 --> 02:50:13.160]  and about the same time i was being trained uh changed branches i was being trained as a medic
[02:50:13.800 --> 02:50:18.760]  and they told us in our briefings that we were going to see diseases that had been or were
[02:50:18.760 --> 02:50:23.720]  starting to see already diseases that had been eradicated for 40 or 50 years in this country
[02:50:23.720 --> 02:50:29.160]  we're coming back into the country now because the illegals don't go through a medical screening
[02:50:29.160 --> 02:50:33.400]  or anything wow this is intriguing stay there i'm going to come back to you mike please and then
[02:50:33.400 --> 02:50:38.200]  fox bring it to you next then peter and kevin and jordy a little bit overdrive i'll get to everybody
[02:50:38.760 --> 02:50:44.680]  but oh yeah they had a rex 84 plan to open the borders and bring in marshal law in the 80s but
[02:50:44.680 --> 02:50:49.400]  reagan didn't go along with it and neither did congress some of his own people inside doing it
[02:50:50.200 --> 02:50:54.920]  and then i mean there's groups with even in administrations and then now they're doing it

[02:54:32.840 --> 02:54:38.760]  that was just a quote by someone but two-thirds of the immigrants got turned back and they had
[02:54:38.760 --> 02:54:44.600]  criminal records or diseases now it's if your criminals if you have diseases please come uh
[02:54:44.600 --> 02:54:49.320]  was talking to mike in alabama who said when he was in the military they got briefings on
[02:54:49.320 --> 02:54:53.080]  this well i know that's for a fact actually interesting to get it from him back in the
[02:54:53.080 --> 02:54:59.720]  early 90s but uh then you were talking about what they said when you became a medic any other points
[02:54:59.720 --> 02:55:05.720]  on that subject yeah well just like i said that we'd get we'd see diseases that have been eradicated
[02:55:05.720 --> 02:55:11.160]  40 and 50 years ago in the u.s and they would be coming back and and we're seeing that too
[02:55:11.160 --> 02:55:17.320]  and then one one thing that's on a little different subject i read a book about this time
[02:55:17.880 --> 02:55:25.080]  it was by a retired nasa guy and he was saying something that in 69 alex that in the final
[02:55:25.080 --> 02:55:30.920]  soviet border war that the russians had used a battlefield tactical nuke against the chinese
[02:55:30.920 --> 02:55:37.560]  to break off the conflict because they were more uh concerned about nato in in the west and they
[02:55:37.560 --> 02:55:43.560]  were trying to you know slug it out with china man to man and that's the only time i've ever read it
[02:55:44.120 --> 02:55:48.520]  and i don't know if any of your other listeners have ever read that same book i can't find it
[02:55:48.520 --> 02:55:53.560]  yeah i'm not familiar with that i know that it's been declassified that the chinese and the russians
[02:55:53.560 --> 02:55:59.880]  came to the u.s and wanted the u.s to nuke the other and take out the other so it is a three-way
[02:55:59.880 --> 02:56:05.960]  power block that's undoubtedly going on none of these people trust each other it's just it's a
[02:56:05.960 --> 02:56:10.920]  mess let's talk to fox thanks for the call good points have a great weekend by the way i'll be

[03:01:20.440 --> 03:01:26.360]  really makes me sick when i see the uh commercials and propaganda on tv just quite frankly trying
[03:01:26.360 --> 03:01:31.240]  to brainwash the public and i really have to turn the channel or just turn it off all together
