[00:00.000 --> 00:12.280]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the
[00:12.280 --> 00:16.800]  front lines of the Info War.
[00:16.800 --> 00:22.280]  The plans you prefer to will soon be back in our hands.
[00:22.280 --> 00:27.680]  Well here we are for the first broadcast of 2020.
[00:27.680 --> 00:35.360]  The planet is still here, we're still here, but the situation obviously in the Middle
[00:35.360 --> 00:40.760]  East, in Iraq is very sophisticated, very dangerous, a lot of different forces coming
[00:40.760 --> 00:48.200]  together there at the center of the grand chessboard and it could trigger a larger regional war
[00:48.200 --> 00:49.200]  at any time.
[00:49.200 --> 00:52.440]  We'll have the latest for you on that coming up.
[00:52.440 --> 01:02.200]  But I should also add, starting in the third segment here today, or in about 20 minutes
[01:02.200 --> 01:10.240]  to be precise, we're going to air a couple weeks in the making a special report on just
[01:10.240 --> 01:14.840]  some of the dangers of vaccines that are actually on the inserts that they don't want you to
[01:14.840 --> 01:17.160]  know about, that they're lying to you about.
[01:17.160 --> 01:22.680]  So this is a special that Zach Voorhees shot a few weeks ago when he was here and one of
[01:22.680 --> 01:27.080]  our great researchers, Rob Dew, got it and added a lot of clips and documentation to
[01:27.080 --> 01:28.160]  it.
[01:28.160 --> 01:33.520]  So in the new year, I want to start out with something that really allows us to take control
[01:33.520 --> 01:37.520]  of our lives and our bodies and say no to the establishment, what they're trying to put
[01:37.520 --> 01:38.960]  into us and how they're trying to control us.
[01:38.960 --> 01:41.640]  So that is coming up.
[01:41.640 --> 01:51.400]  And Mike Adams has done a lot of great work dealing with the nature of reality, and he
[01:51.400 --> 01:55.160]  really is a scientist and he really is somebody that I respect.
[01:55.160 --> 02:00.640]  And so he's going to be tackling some of the folks out there that have trouble dealing
[02:00.640 --> 02:06.920]  with third dimensional theorem, because if people can't understand that, they can understand
[02:06.920 --> 02:14.000]  some of the more complex systems and interdimensional associations that are taking place.
[02:14.000 --> 02:17.800]  And then he's going to get into some of the things going on in our universe that he talked
[02:17.800 --> 02:18.800]  about many years ago.
[02:18.800 --> 02:21.280]  They're now being looked at by mainline scientific groups.
[02:21.280 --> 02:25.640]  I'm just going to leave it at that, that Mike Adams is going to be in studio today.
[02:25.640 --> 02:30.720]  It's probably best when he's here that I don't even be in the studio or I'm going to interrupt
[02:30.720 --> 02:31.720]  constantly.
[02:31.720 --> 02:33.880]  But we're going to see what happens today.
[02:33.880 --> 02:37.800]  Mike likes it when I'm on the show with him, but I really want to sit back and hear what
[02:37.800 --> 02:39.760]  he has to say for myself.
[02:39.760 --> 02:45.400]  So this is the first transmission of the Alan Jones show in the year 2020.
[02:45.400 --> 02:50.760]  Well, we did one live last night that you can find posted on m4s.com, but this is the
[02:50.760 --> 02:55.840]  first show and we're very, very honored to be here.
[02:55.840 --> 02:56.920]  Okay.
[02:56.920 --> 03:04.520]  I didn't get yesterday into any detail with the announcements of the Chinese communists
[03:04.520 --> 03:08.040]  and their involvement in our domestic policies.
[03:08.040 --> 03:12.280]  I didn't get into the fact that they're wanting our guns openly and just how incredible it
[03:12.280 --> 03:15.840]  is that they're meddling inside the United States with the Democratic Party, just how
[03:15.840 --> 03:22.760]  treasonous that is and how this illustrates just how incredibly corrupt the collaborator
[03:22.760 --> 03:27.160]  media and the Democrats have gotten, and that ties in to these mass shooters.
[03:27.160 --> 03:30.960]  Now the media knows that they're hyping up mass shootings, but that's actually creating
[03:30.960 --> 03:36.040]  more of them as we've now entered the year of the false flag, but also the year of the
[03:36.040 --> 03:37.040]  Great Awakening.
[03:37.040 --> 03:40.240]  But the establishment is going to strike back against that and they've told us they're
[03:40.240 --> 03:47.680]  going to do it by prepping everybody that domestic white supremacist slash NRA are going
[03:47.680 --> 03:52.520]  to start blowing everything up and shooting everybody and doing all of this.
[03:52.520 --> 03:56.680]  And so you better know that they are cooking stuff up, but they don't have full control
[03:56.680 --> 03:57.680]  of the government now.
[03:57.680 --> 04:00.800]  It's very hard for them to execute this and not get caught.
[04:00.800 --> 04:09.720]  That's why they want to make it verboten, very, very verboten off limits to question
[04:09.720 --> 04:12.520]  big tragedies when they kick off and when they unfold.
[04:12.520 --> 04:15.920]  I mean, I even questioned right away, is this a real embassy attack?
[04:15.920 --> 04:16.920]  And then clearly it was.
[04:16.920 --> 04:19.360]  You can see the Shiite militias doing it.
[04:19.360 --> 04:21.800]  We'll get more into that as well.
[04:21.800 --> 04:24.640]  So so much to cover here today.
[04:24.640 --> 04:26.560]  Please don't forget.
[04:26.560 --> 04:27.640]  You are not spectators.
[04:27.640 --> 04:29.080]  You are the tip of the spear.
[04:29.080 --> 04:31.080]  You are the info war.
[04:31.080 --> 04:35.440]  Please share the live links at infowars.com forward slash show band.video and the live
[04:35.440 --> 04:40.160]  Alex Jones feed area on the left hand corner, you pull that down Alex Jones show, click
[04:40.160 --> 04:42.640]  if I don't like feed, share that link.
[04:42.640 --> 04:46.720]  And of course, newswords.com forward slash show that link is not censored as much.
[04:46.720 --> 04:50.760]  That's a better link to share as well newswords.com forward slash show is that's how we override
[04:50.760 --> 04:52.600]  the AI control systems.
[04:52.600 --> 05:02.960]  We'll be back on the first live Alex Jones show of 2020, 2020, 2020, 2020, 2020, 2020.
[05:02.960 --> 05:04.920]  Owl killer in New Jersey.
[05:04.920 --> 05:05.920]  You're on the air.
[05:05.920 --> 05:06.920]  Go ahead.
[05:06.920 --> 05:07.920]  Alex.
[05:07.920 --> 05:09.920]  Hey, I just want to say it's great to be back once again, and I've never gotten to do
[05:09.920 --> 05:11.880]  this, but I'm going to give you a shout out for your product.
[05:11.880 --> 05:16.120]  So that's super blue floor free toothpaste and that super blue whitening toothpaste is
[05:16.120 --> 05:17.120]  on another level.
[05:17.120 --> 05:20.560]  I use the one I use the super blue in the morning and then the whitening at night.
[05:20.560 --> 05:22.320]  It absorbs into your gum.
[05:22.320 --> 05:25.000]  It is by far the best product that I've ever used in my life.
[05:25.000 --> 05:27.880]  I literally just took turbo force on my way to the gym right now.
[05:27.880 --> 05:32.520]  I've had four shoulder surgery and a back surgery and that body has made me feel better
[05:32.520 --> 05:36.040]  than any type of physical therapy or anything that I've ever done in my life.
[05:36.040 --> 05:38.840]  So I just want to get that out of the way to support this man.
[05:38.840 --> 05:41.400]  Everything that he exposed, nobody knew about Bohemian Grove.
[05:41.400 --> 05:42.560]  Nobody knew about FD.
[05:42.560 --> 05:43.840]  Nobody knew about Bilderberg.
[05:43.840 --> 05:47.200]  Nobody called 9 11 before it happened in July 2001.
[05:47.200 --> 05:48.200]  Go look it up yourself.
[05:48.200 --> 05:49.200]  Well, we try our best.
[05:49.200 --> 05:51.800]  I'm sure they definitely want to stop the year without you or not here, but yeah, these
[05:51.800 --> 05:52.800]  are all great products.
[05:52.800 --> 05:54.800]  So thank you, sir.
[05:54.800 --> 06:09.800]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say, I don't know what's going
[06:09.800 --> 06:16.800]  to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you got one.
[06:16.800 --> 06:27.520]  On the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[06:27.520 --> 06:32.280]  I gave that speech that little clips from more than 10 years ago in Dallas, Texas to
[06:32.280 --> 06:36.240]  a packed theater of over 2000 patriots.
[06:36.240 --> 06:39.720]  And I knew we've changed the world together and we have done it.
[06:39.720 --> 06:44.440]  We're not trying to take credit here, but we have to also take measure and thank God
[06:44.440 --> 06:49.440]  for the Providence we've been given and admit to ourselves as the people that run this broadcast
[06:49.440 --> 06:54.720]  and you, the supporters, the eyes and ears of the transmission that we've taken the
[06:54.720 --> 06:58.560]  ball back from the NWO and are advancing down the field.
[06:58.560 --> 07:01.200]  But now the real confrontations are beginning.
[07:01.200 --> 07:06.120]  We'll break down the latest with Mike Adams in studio on what's happening in the Middle
[07:06.120 --> 07:07.120]  East.
[07:07.120 --> 07:08.120]  What's really behind that.
[07:08.120 --> 07:09.440]  Who the different factions are.
[07:09.440 --> 07:15.040]  I'm saying this is a threat, promising strong action that you now see.
[07:15.040 --> 07:18.120]  We're going to be laying all of that out, but you know, I don't want to be distracted
[07:18.120 --> 07:21.400]  just by this.
[07:21.400 --> 07:31.600]  I want to look at what's being normalized.
[07:31.600 --> 07:39.920]  You know, you saw the me too movement with people like Matt Lauer when they have Sandra
[07:39.920 --> 07:43.360]  Bullock on the show in a sex scene.
[07:43.360 --> 07:46.560]  She'd shot and he'd say, wow, we can see you naked in this movie.
[07:46.560 --> 07:50.840]  And they giggled and they went, oh my God, that was sexual harassment on TV and I'm not
[07:50.840 --> 07:56.360]  defending Matt Lauer, but, but they would act like that was this huge crime and look
[07:56.360 --> 07:59.240]  at how creepy he is.
[07:59.240 --> 08:02.960]  And he would tell other women, you know, that they were attractive in things.
[08:02.960 --> 08:06.520]  That's like worse than child molestation.
[08:06.520 --> 08:12.640]  But then when public schools bring in fat men dressed like clowns to have kids bounce
[08:12.640 --> 08:16.640]  on their laps and the fat men tell the little kids about sex and the men say, I'm here
[08:16.640 --> 08:17.640]  to groom your children.
[08:17.640 --> 08:21.640]  We're told it's beautiful and wonderful by the same leftist media.
[08:21.640 --> 08:25.360]  So it's the way that they tell you what's bad.
[08:25.360 --> 08:27.760]  They tell you what's good.
[08:27.760 --> 08:29.160]  It's the same thing with vaccines.
[08:29.160 --> 08:31.080]  I mean, the inserts say they can kill you.
[08:31.080 --> 08:35.080]  They have secret fund that pays out billions of dollars a year in awards of people damaged
[08:35.080 --> 08:36.440]  by them.
[08:36.440 --> 08:42.040]  It's a deadly precedent people to put in your body, whatever they want.
[08:42.040 --> 08:45.000]  And now they don't want to have a debate or a discussion about it on the internet using
[08:45.000 --> 08:46.200]  AI to censor everybody.
[08:46.200 --> 08:51.000]  Well, we've got a special report that put a lot of work and research into in the next
[08:51.000 --> 08:52.000]  three segments.
[08:52.000 --> 08:54.400]  So please watch this and please spread the word.
[08:54.400 --> 08:59.560]  And as we speak, it's being posted to the front page of MFullWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[08:59.560 --> 09:05.160]  Emergency report on the real dangers of vaccines that you need to know and that you need to
[09:05.160 --> 09:06.160]  share.
[09:06.160 --> 09:07.560]  This will literally save lives.
[09:07.560 --> 09:09.680]  It's not the vaccines on a real technology.
[09:09.680 --> 09:14.600]  It's that it's being purposely tainted like the water supply and everything else to make
[09:14.600 --> 09:15.600]  us more manageable.
[09:15.600 --> 09:18.760]  One of the biggest health threats out there.
[09:18.760 --> 09:21.680]  So that's coming up.
[09:21.680 --> 09:25.720]  But I wanted to hit these reports and I covered it a lot yesterday on Owen Schreuer's last
[09:25.720 --> 09:26.720]  show of the year.
[09:26.720 --> 09:30.000]  That's archived at Band-Aid video and I hope you'll go watch our break down there where
[09:30.000 --> 09:35.120]  we get into it more detail, but these articles all tie together.
[09:35.120 --> 09:38.880]  Chinese state media gun ownership, out of control in the U.S., the authoritarian Chinese
[09:38.880 --> 09:45.480]  Communist Party, CCP calls every nation with more freedom lawless and is actively funding
[09:45.480 --> 09:48.960]  Hollywood and the Democratic Party to take our guns.
[09:48.960 --> 09:50.320]  That's outside meddling.
[09:50.320 --> 09:55.720]  The takeover, China is building enormous, self-sustaining cities, Chinese cities all
[09:55.720 --> 10:01.720]  over African continent that literally feed on the people, exploit them as slave labor,
[10:01.720 --> 10:04.320]  and then take control of their nations.
[10:04.320 --> 10:05.320]  Very important report.
[10:05.320 --> 10:07.200]  It was linked up on dredgereport.com yesterday.
[10:07.200 --> 10:09.560]  And that ties in with this.
[10:09.560 --> 10:17.080]  It's the United Nations that has endorsed the communist Chinese model of the Internet
[10:17.080 --> 10:21.760]  for the world, for global standardization, for a world Internet ID and world social
[10:21.760 --> 10:22.760]  score.
[10:22.760 --> 10:23.760]  That's now official.
[10:23.760 --> 10:27.960]  We warned you years ago, you could see them lining up, but now it's public.
[10:27.960 --> 10:31.480]  The UN is one of the most authoritarian, oppressive, evil groups.
[10:31.480 --> 10:36.440]  The horrible things they do, the legalized slavery they run, the exploitation of countries,
[10:36.440 --> 10:41.280]  but they have every Miss America pageant and every other person worshiping them, that that's
[10:41.280 --> 10:42.480]  how you're a good person.
[10:42.480 --> 10:48.480]  Every woman aspires to raise money for the UN, just because we're told so.
[10:48.480 --> 10:52.080]  We're also told men can have babies.
[10:52.080 --> 10:59.520]  We're also told that 2020 is the new decade, no, it's the end of the second decade.
[10:59.520 --> 11:01.760]  So this is how there's a war on logic happening.
[11:01.760 --> 11:09.320]  Paul Watson shot an excellent report on this, calling it the dumbest decade, but it really
[11:09.320 --> 11:11.240]  is not the decade being over.
[11:11.240 --> 11:16.240]  So you know you're in a dumb decade, but even the headlines dumb, and I'm not bashing Paul.
[11:16.240 --> 11:24.640]  Everyone has just adopted that now 10 is the new decade when it's the end of the decade.
[11:24.640 --> 11:25.640]  It's amazing.
[11:25.640 --> 11:29.760]  It's like saying in a 10-mile race, the last mile is the 11th mile.
[11:29.760 --> 11:31.640]  It's a war on logic.
[11:31.640 --> 11:37.040]  But getting back to the UN and the globalists that went to China 60 years ago, didn't have
[11:37.040 --> 11:40.840]  running water in almost every area, and suddenly now it's got five times the industry we do
[11:40.840 --> 11:46.200]  and it's just dominating everything because it's a one-sided deal.
[11:46.200 --> 11:53.920]  New York UN office recruits paramilitary troops for disarmament and reintegration of U.S. civilians.
[11:53.920 --> 11:57.840]  And it says for the U.S. as well, you've got the Strong Cities Initiative under Obama
[11:57.840 --> 12:03.200]  to have the UN take over the civilian police boards, and that was proposed by the Attorney
[12:03.200 --> 12:04.200]  General.
[12:04.200 --> 12:08.720]  Well, rather than at the time, you don't just have the feds come in and take over your
[12:08.720 --> 12:12.520]  city when your police are, quote, bad.
[12:12.520 --> 12:14.880]  Now the UN would do it, but that got stopped by Trump.
[12:14.880 --> 12:16.800]  That's how close we are to this.
[12:16.800 --> 12:22.480]  And just like they don't make the vaccine damage a big deal, they don't make this a
[12:22.480 --> 12:23.480]  big deal.
[12:23.480 --> 12:27.320]  It's just, oh, the UN, oh, the UN suing over Trump and the border, oh, the UN's building
[12:27.320 --> 12:30.160]  refugee centers on our border recruiting people to flood us.
[12:30.160 --> 12:31.240]  Same thing in Europe.
[12:31.240 --> 12:34.040]  This is the military assault, replacement migration.
[12:34.040 --> 12:38.520]  And I know you know all this, but the point is it's still going on through the government,
[12:38.520 --> 12:42.040]  through the State Department, because Trump hasn't gotten control of the government.
[12:42.040 --> 12:45.360]  And if my crew members were rebelling against me, as I've said a thousand times, I couldn't
[12:45.360 --> 12:46.640]  probably stop them.
[12:46.640 --> 12:50.680]  So that's why you can't really blame Trump, because this is what he's going through.
[12:50.680 --> 12:54.280]  When he finds out they're bad, he fires them.
[12:54.280 --> 12:56.400]  But how many levels deep can he go?
[12:56.400 --> 12:59.840]  He just doesn't have the intel.
[12:59.840 --> 13:05.840]  Leaked U.S. Army document outlines plans for reeducation camps in America, free download,
[13:05.840 --> 13:08.760]  tomorrow, and get it out to everybody you know.
[13:08.760 --> 13:15.760]  Now, this is from archive.org, and it's an M4Wars.com article.
[13:15.760 --> 13:16.760]  Paul Watson wrote about it.
[13:16.760 --> 13:22.160]  People didn't believe this, but FM3-39.40 from 2010 took a few years to come out.
[13:22.160 --> 13:23.400]  We got it.
[13:23.400 --> 13:24.720]  People didn't believe it.
[13:24.720 --> 13:30.280]  Talks about processing social security numbers, how to put Americans into the camps, how the
[13:30.280 --> 13:32.000]  dissenters helped me put in other areas.
[13:32.000 --> 13:38.160]  This is the weatherman plan that Larry Grathwald exposed, and again, this is this parallel
[13:38.160 --> 13:43.840]  system where now they have a U.N.-funded group in Austin and other areas microchipping the
[13:43.840 --> 13:48.800]  homeless, and it's all just going on in plain view.
[13:48.800 --> 13:53.120]  So that's how these international corporations put money into the U.N. to come in with governmental
[13:53.120 --> 13:58.280]  power, and then through the TPP and other agreements, waving our national sovereignty.
[13:58.280 --> 14:01.800]  That's why Trump pulled us out of the TPP and pulled us out of some of these agreements,
[14:01.800 --> 14:04.960]  because we never had a congressional discussion.
[14:04.960 --> 14:10.720]  The people never had a discussion about this, but it's just incredible to realize that that's
[14:10.720 --> 14:15.680]  where we've gotten, and there were recruiting and garrisoning troops on the U.N. website
[14:15.680 --> 14:22.080]  they're advertising for disarmament operations around the world, and it also lists the United
[14:22.080 --> 14:26.440]  Nations operations in the U.S. in the document.
[14:26.440 --> 14:30.280]  Now understand, under Obama, he told the Army, this is reeducation.
[14:30.280 --> 14:33.080]  That's a Soviet-Communist term.
[14:33.080 --> 14:35.120]  That's not us calling it reeducation camps.
[14:35.120 --> 14:36.120]  That's them.
[14:36.120 --> 14:42.360]  So this is what they'd like to normalize and like to use crises as good as to accept like
[14:42.360 --> 14:46.480]  a civil war they're trying to trigger, and that's in the documents we got about Soros
[14:46.480 --> 14:49.720]  a few years ago, trying to trigger race war in the United States.
[14:49.720 --> 14:54.520]  And we're going to go to break and come back with Zach Voorhees and Rob Doos to tell report
[14:54.520 --> 14:56.160]  on vaccine dangers.
[14:56.160 --> 14:59.680]  This is so critical to share that I'll be back with Mike Adams and studio coming up
[14:59.680 --> 15:00.680]  after that.
[15:00.680 --> 15:04.360]  But please don't forget, we can only extend this a few more days.
[15:04.360 --> 15:07.400]  The New Year specials, because a lot of these items are about to sell out.
[15:07.400 --> 15:12.200]  Biggest sells ever, double Patriot points, free shipping, all the great items we have

[15:38.600 --> 15:42.000]  So thank you for supporting us and keeping us in the fight long past.
[15:42.000 --> 15:46.120]  The globalists thought they could have taken us out, but you held us up because you are
[15:46.120 --> 15:47.120]  the info war.
[15:47.120 --> 15:52.880]  And here we are, together, thanks to God's providence and your hearing the call of God
[15:52.880 --> 15:56.360]  and taking action, we're still on air together.
[15:56.360 --> 15:58.360]  Mayweather, special reports straight ahead.
[16:27.360 --> 16:32.440]  I'm here with Scott Yousseam, founder of OMG Tax.

[16:43.560 --> 16:47.120]  We even have reduced the total debt some of our clients were required to pay through what
[16:47.120 --> 16:49.080]  is known as an offer in compromise.
[16:49.080 --> 16:51.360]  Can you give us an example of somebody you help?
[16:51.360 --> 16:52.960]  Oh, can I ever?
[16:52.960 --> 16:58.200]  We have taken a $500,000 liability with the IRS.
[16:58.200 --> 16:59.200]  Guess what?
[16:59.200 --> 17:03.920]  The client didn't pay a dime through the representation known as non-collectible status with the government.
[17:03.920 --> 17:09.000]  If you owe the IRS more than $10,000 and you want to see if it's possible to pay a lot

[18:26.760 --> 18:29.640]  lost almost 40 pounds in less than four months.
[18:29.640 --> 18:30.640]  It's incredible.

[18:46.560 --> 18:49.240]  That's the real reason you want to get them is because they're amazing.
[18:49.240 --> 18:53.640]  And then when you get great results, please tell others about it word of mouth.
[18:53.640 --> 18:57.320]  That's how we expand in the face of the NWO instead of imploding.
[18:57.320 --> 18:59.160]  We're fighting to win and we are winning.
[18:59.160 --> 19:01.760]  Thanks to you.
[19:01.760 --> 19:05.000]  A little less than four months ago, I made the announcement on air.
[19:05.000 --> 19:10.600]  I said, Hey, I have a tendency to take the high quality supplements from fours life for
[19:10.600 --> 19:15.160]  a while, get great results, and then slowly I stop using them.
[19:15.160 --> 19:17.200]  I forget to religiously take them.
[19:17.200 --> 19:22.760]  I'm going to religiously take the supplements for the next few months and I've lost almost
[19:22.760 --> 19:23.760]  40 pounds.
[19:23.760 --> 19:25.800]  Now, everybody can see it on air.
[19:25.800 --> 19:27.720]  My energy is off the charts.
[19:27.720 --> 19:29.440]  Everything is amazing.
[19:29.440 --> 19:33.160]  And it's because I am taking the employers life products, the krill oil.
[19:33.160 --> 19:35.760]  I'm taking the X2 and the X3.
[19:35.760 --> 19:40.120]  I'm taking the brain force plus when I work out, when I have to work really late, I'm
[19:40.120 --> 19:42.360]  taking half a pack of turbo force.
[19:42.360 --> 19:44.640]  It is clean energy.
[19:44.640 --> 19:48.080]  It is really making my whole life so much more enjoyable.
[19:48.080 --> 19:49.960]  It's making the shows more focused.
[19:49.960 --> 19:51.360]  I've got more energy.
[19:51.360 --> 19:55.600]  We have huge sales going right now for the new year at infowarslife.com, a big clearance
[19:55.600 --> 19:56.600]  sale.
[19:56.600 --> 20:25.360]  Check it all out at infowarslife.com.
[20:25.360 --> 20:31.560]  By the mid 1980s, tens of millions of Americans alone had been damaged by tainted and poisoned
[20:31.560 --> 20:32.560]  vaccines.
[20:32.560 --> 20:38.280]  A secret fund and government agency was created to quietly pay people off and cover up the
[20:38.280 --> 20:39.400]  truth.
[20:39.400 --> 20:42.400]  And since then, the damage has only increased.
[20:42.400 --> 20:46.920]  Part of a larger covert program carried out by the United Nations worldwide.
[20:46.920 --> 20:52.120]  In this emergency special report, we documented detail just some of these incredible abuses
[20:52.120 --> 20:57.200]  and now the push to make vaccination with hundreds of different vaccines mandatory
[20:57.200 --> 21:00.200]  and to make the investigation of vaccines illegal.
[21:00.200 --> 21:05.600]  Already, vaccine activists across the world are being arrested and silenced.
[21:05.600 --> 21:06.600]  They're coming for you.
[21:06.600 --> 21:12.120]  They're coming for all of us next.
[21:12.120 --> 21:16.200]  Hi.
[21:16.200 --> 21:21.720]  My name is Zach Voorhees.
[21:21.720 --> 21:23.960]  And I'm the Google whistleblower.
[21:23.960 --> 21:29.000]  One of the underreported stories about me blowing the whistle was one of the reasons
[21:29.000 --> 21:36.160]  why I blew it, which was because of Google's censorship on the vaccine issue.
[21:36.160 --> 21:43.600]  What I saw as an employee of Google was a course of parents beginning to erupt on social
[21:43.600 --> 21:48.920]  media, explaining that their children had been damaged by vaccines.
[21:48.920 --> 21:52.440]  People responded by engaging in censorship.
[21:52.440 --> 21:59.640]  So today I'm stepping forward and giving you a special Operation Vaximoa.
[21:59.640 --> 22:03.640]  We're going to begin this segment by talking about what happened last year.
[22:03.640 --> 22:09.320]  To say more now, a separate police investigation is underway into the death of two babies following
[22:09.320 --> 22:12.960]  injections of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine.
[22:12.960 --> 22:16.840]  This comes as health officials continue to determine the cause of the deaths with the
[22:16.840 --> 22:19.480]  help of the WA Tome.
[22:19.480 --> 22:21.040]  They told me he was dead.
[22:21.040 --> 22:26.520]  Her little boy died within a minute of being immunised here at Sava'isa Foto Hospital.
[22:26.520 --> 22:34.440]  Two hours earlier, baby Lana had died three minutes after receiving the same MMR vaccine.
[22:34.440 --> 22:37.680]  When I took my baby, she was strong and healthy.
[22:37.680 --> 22:40.720]  Lana's parents had tried to have a baby for 10 years.
[22:40.720 --> 22:42.320]  She was their miracle child.
[22:42.320 --> 22:45.160]  They just want to know what went wrong.
[22:45.160 --> 22:50.840]  People say deaths from MMR vaccines are extremely rare and there are two main reasons why it
[22:50.840 --> 22:51.840]  would happen.
[22:51.840 --> 22:58.120]  It's just sad that we have to hear that other two families have to go through the same thing,
[22:58.120 --> 23:00.000]  you know, without knowing why.
[23:00.000 --> 23:03.320]  The grief of these young parents is still very raw.
[23:03.320 --> 23:05.600]  To lose one child is unbearable.
[23:05.600 --> 23:07.840]  To lose two, unimaginable.
[23:07.840 --> 23:09.720]  This is Lana Ray's grave.
[23:09.720 --> 23:14.520]  She died in April at Starship Hospital after being medevacked here from Samoa.
[23:14.520 --> 23:17.680]  And this is her brother Jamie Ray's grave in Samoa.
[23:17.680 --> 23:19.760]  He died two years ago.
[23:19.760 --> 23:24.520]  Both children deteriorated steadily after receiving the MMR vaccine in Samoa.
[23:24.520 --> 23:26.520]  It was in so much pain.
[23:26.520 --> 23:28.760]  I told him, Mama, you're going to be okay.
[23:28.760 --> 23:32.440]  You just got to fix this and then you're going to go home.
[23:32.440 --> 23:34.600]  But Jamie Ray never made it home.
[23:34.600 --> 23:37.040]  Hyphethas led to massive organ failure.
[23:37.040 --> 23:40.320]  Typhoid sepsis, dengue, all suspected.
[23:40.320 --> 23:44.920]  There was never the conclusion that it was the MMR shot.
[23:44.920 --> 23:48.840]  That's why we never linked it until Lana Ray.
[23:48.840 --> 23:53.440]  After her immunization, Lana Ray developed the same symptoms as her brother.
[23:53.440 --> 23:57.440]  So let's talk about what happened exactly in Samoa.
[23:57.440 --> 24:04.800]  To that, let's talk about October 2019, when the Samoan government mandated that the measles
[24:04.800 --> 24:12.240]  inoculation was going to be given to everyone and anyone starting from six months old.
[24:12.240 --> 24:18.520]  It eventually progressed to police going door to door and forcing vaccination.
[24:18.520 --> 24:23.440]  Samoa's normally busy capital, Apia, is all but deserted.
[24:23.440 --> 24:28.360]  Around the country, businesses have been ordered to close their doors, vehicles banned from
[24:28.360 --> 24:32.200]  the roads, and people told to stay at home.
[24:32.200 --> 24:37.160]  Only police and mobile vaccination crews are allowed to be out and about.
[24:37.160 --> 24:43.200]  They're looking for red flags, literally tied to houses to show those inside need to be
[24:43.200 --> 24:44.200]  immunized.
[24:44.200 --> 24:49.920]  A mass vaccination campaign has been underway for two weeks, but the number of cases and
[24:49.920 --> 24:52.720]  deaths continues to rise.
[24:52.720 --> 24:58.000]  So the government took the extreme step of shutting the entire country down.
[24:58.000 --> 25:09.600]  We have so many anti-vaccine people, and of course, many of our people still resort
[25:09.600 --> 25:11.600]  to traditional events.
[25:11.600 --> 25:17.600]  And eventually, it got so bad that when people started to speak out on social media, the
[25:17.600 --> 25:21.000]  police came and arrested them.
[25:21.000 --> 25:25.240]  Let's take a look at the timeline of events that led up to this.
[25:25.240 --> 25:34.240]  It starts in July of 2018, when two babies died back-to-back following an MMR vaccination.
[25:34.240 --> 25:37.160]  It was two infants.
[25:37.160 --> 25:42.400]  One had received the MMR and then died minutes later.
[25:42.400 --> 25:48.240]  Seeing this, the mother of the other infant told the nurse, please don't vaccinate my
[25:48.240 --> 25:49.240]  baby.
[25:49.240 --> 25:54.520]  But the baby was vaccinated anyways, and also died moments later.
[25:54.520 --> 26:01.240]  This caused a very big stir within the Samoan government, and they canceled the MMR vaccine
[26:01.240 --> 26:03.360]  for an entire month.
[26:03.360 --> 26:09.120]  After a safety review found that allegedly the MMR vaccine had been mixed in with a
[26:09.120 --> 26:15.600]  muscle relaxant, the Samoan government decided that they would re-institute the measles vaccine
[26:15.600 --> 26:19.760]  in April of 2019.
[26:19.760 --> 26:30.880]  By October 1st of 2019, UNICEF had delivered over 100,000 doses of measles vaccine to Samoa.
[26:30.880 --> 26:40.480]  And then just a few weeks later, the World Bank gave $34 million as a grant for, just
[26:40.480 --> 26:44.320]  in case, of a measles outbreak.
[26:44.320 --> 26:52.240]  Quite a coincidence that one month later, in November of 15th, 2019, the Samoa government
[26:52.240 --> 26:58.520]  declares a state of emergency for, you guessed it, a measles outbreak.
[26:58.520 --> 27:04.920]  So with Samoa alone in this series of events, well, it turns out that it was not, because
[27:04.920 --> 27:13.080]  its neighbors, Fiji and Tonga, also received measles vaccines from UNICEF.
[27:13.080 --> 27:20.280]  And like clockwork, within about a month, both of them had declared a measles outbreak.
[27:20.280 --> 27:23.280]  So who exactly is UNICEF?
[27:23.280 --> 27:31.420]  UNICEF, which stands for the United Nations Children's Fund, gets two-thirds of its funding
[27:31.420 --> 27:35.400]  from governments, the rest from private donations.
[27:35.400 --> 27:42.520]  One of the biggest funders of UNICEF turns out to be the United States of America, giving
[27:42.520 --> 27:47.880]  $132.5 million in 2019.
[27:47.880 --> 27:59.440]  That's right, you, the taxpayer, are paying for these vaccines to go to third-world countries.
[27:59.440 --> 28:03.640]  Let's return back to Samoa.
[28:03.640 --> 28:11.200]  In October 1st of 2019, we have 115,000 doses of measles vaccines being sent to that country.
[28:11.200 --> 28:19.160]  By October 13th, 2019, we see the beginnings of an outbreak, with 48 reported cases of
[28:19.160 --> 28:24.920]  measles, six reported deaths, including one child.
[28:24.920 --> 28:30.960]  In response, the Samoan Ministry of Health released a report testing specimens for measles
[28:30.960 --> 28:32.460]  virus.
[28:32.460 --> 28:38.400]  Of the 36 specimens tested, seven tested positive for measles.
[28:38.400 --> 28:44.760]  In fact, most of the cases turned out not to be measles at all.
[28:44.760 --> 29:10.560]  So with these seven cases testing positive, Samoa went ahead and declared a measles epidemic.
[29:10.560 --> 29:24.240]  We brought you what will help you stop OVP because MC and N С is not all the way through
[29:24.240 --> 29:25.240]  the pandemic.

[30:07.520 --> 30:09.520]  There's nowhere you can spend money.
[30:09.520 --> 30:15.280]  There's nowhere you can place your bet in a fight where it's going to have more power

[30:23.040 --> 30:27.320]  the system where the spirit of resistance lives to drive it home to the enemy.
[30:27.320 --> 30:28.320]  And so it's very simple.
[30:28.320 --> 30:32.840]  If you don't want to be slaves and you want to see the fight taken to the enemy, which
[30:32.840 --> 30:38.200]  God wants to see, you see, we have to make the effort, 110% God will finish the move.
[30:38.200 --> 30:42.040]  And I know I need to stay in the fight in the attack, attack, attack.
[30:42.040 --> 30:43.040]  I want to attack.
[30:43.040 --> 30:46.320]  I want to go after the globalist and just believe me, ladies and gentlemen, that if
[30:46.320 --> 30:49.760]  you want somebody to commit to you and your family to fight for all of our futures together,

[30:51.720 --> 30:55.800]  I'm going to bust my ass with everything I've got for us, for myself and my family,
[30:55.800 --> 31:00.800]  for your family, because we're in this together, infowarstore.com.
[31:00.800 --> 31:04.040]  So what's the most important part, let's say, in a bulldozer running over the globalist?
[31:04.040 --> 31:08.560]  The treads, the wheels, the engine, the scoop on the front, it's all very important, but
[31:08.560 --> 31:12.360]  the fuel is paramount, and that's my allegor.
[31:12.360 --> 31:17.160]  Turboforce is vitamins, minerals, amino acids that synergistically work with six different
[31:17.160 --> 31:21.560]  natural forms of healthy clean energy that last for 10 hours in the average metabolic
[31:21.560 --> 31:23.360]  system, metabolism of a human.
[31:23.360 --> 31:25.640]  Some people get 15 hours out of them, some people get about eight hours.
[31:25.640 --> 31:29.040]  But people take this, people are taking sports, people cannot believe it's the best they've
[31:29.040 --> 31:31.560]  ever had because it's not high.
[31:31.560 --> 31:36.680]  Nobody puts as much product into their pre-workouts, their post-workouts, you can call us whatever
[31:36.680 --> 31:37.680]  you want.

[31:45.320 --> 31:47.280]  It's like a bulldozer without the diesel fuel.

[32:06.920 --> 32:12.520]  So here we are in the year 2020, and old friends are not forgotten.
[32:12.520 --> 32:15.320]  You the Patriots have kept them for wars on the air.
[32:15.320 --> 32:16.320]  Thank you so much.
[32:16.320 --> 32:19.800]  I don't want the globalists to win for my children's future, for your children's future,
[32:19.800 --> 32:23.360]  but also I just personally don't want them to be able to shut us down.
[32:23.360 --> 32:25.360]  And thanks to you, spread the word and buy the products.

[32:52.680 --> 32:53.840]  and fund the info war.
[32:53.840 --> 32:58.360]  But whatever you do, remember 2020 is a critical year, so everybody get the word out and fight
[32:58.360 --> 33:02.600]  for freedom.
[33:02.600 --> 33:13.680]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:13.680 --> 33:23.920]  By November, there are now 4,693 cases of measles, resulting in 63 children's deaths.
[33:23.920 --> 33:32.080]  What's interesting about this is the incredibly high death rate, 1 in about 67 in these cases
[33:32.080 --> 33:33.760]  of measles.
[33:33.760 --> 33:35.640]  Why is this interesting?
[33:35.640 --> 33:43.400]  Because normally, when someone contracts measles, they have a very low probability of dying.
[33:43.400 --> 33:52.360]  In fact, before 2003, the case was about 1 in 10,000.
[33:52.360 --> 33:55.880]  So now we've got 1 out of 67.
[33:55.880 --> 34:03.640]  According to the CDC's own data, since 2003 in the United States, more people have died
[34:03.640 --> 34:07.280]  from the measles vaccine than from actual measles.
[34:07.280 --> 34:15.320]  Since 2003, there hasn't been a single death from measles within the United States.
[34:15.320 --> 34:21.400]  In fact, it's been argued, historically, that measles was one of the gentlest diseases
[34:21.400 --> 34:23.480]  that you can get.
[34:23.480 --> 34:32.440]  In fact, this was recorded in an old Brady Bunch special in which one of the family members
[34:32.440 --> 34:38.320]  got measles, and she said that there's no better disease to get than the measles.
[34:38.320 --> 34:40.320]  Are you sure it's the measles?
[34:40.320 --> 34:44.920]  Well, he certainly got all the symptoms, a slight temperature, a lot of dogs and a great
[34:44.920 --> 34:45.920]  big smile.
[34:45.920 --> 34:46.920]  A great big smile.
[34:46.920 --> 34:47.920]  No school for a few days.
[34:47.920 --> 34:48.920]  Boy, this is the life, isn't it?
[34:48.920 --> 34:49.920]  Yeah.
[34:49.920 --> 34:50.920]  If you have to get sick, you can't get measles.
[34:50.920 --> 34:55.360]  That's right, no medicine.
[34:55.360 --> 35:00.080]  What can explain the sudden measles outbreak within Samoa?
[35:00.080 --> 35:06.760]  Well, that was a question that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. asked, in which he said, and I quote,
[35:06.760 --> 35:13.600]  There is the possibility that children who received the live measles virus during Samoa's
[35:13.600 --> 35:20.080]  recent vaccination drive may have shed the virus and inadvertently infected vulnerable
[35:20.080 --> 35:21.080]  children.
[35:21.080 --> 35:28.360]  It is a regrettable possibility that these children are casualties of Merck's vaccine.
[35:28.360 --> 35:33.680]  Alarmed CDC officials documented this emerging phenomenon during the measles outbreak in
[35:33.680 --> 35:37.880]  California in 2015.
[35:37.880 --> 35:43.960]  Federal epidemiological investigations found that at least one-third of California cases
[35:43.960 --> 35:45.760]  were vaccine strain.
[35:45.760 --> 35:53.000]  This is the measles outbreak that happened during the Disneyland in 2015.
[35:53.000 --> 36:00.760]  In fact, the CDC identified 73 of the 194 measles virus sequences obtained across the
[36:00.760 --> 36:03.560]  entire United States.
[36:03.560 --> 36:10.080]  This means that those children contracted measles from vaccination or from someone who received
[36:10.080 --> 36:12.200]  the vaccine.
[36:12.200 --> 36:16.280]  Is this happening here in Samoa?
[36:16.280 --> 36:20.080]  What exactly is vaccine shedding?
[36:20.080 --> 36:26.760]  Vaccine shedding is the process in which a vaccinated individual gets infected with
[36:26.760 --> 36:30.600]  the virus as a result of the of the vaccination.
[36:30.600 --> 36:36.600]  And as a result, the virus slowly loses out of their body, allowing them to infect people
[36:36.600 --> 36:38.560]  that are vulnerable.
[36:38.560 --> 36:44.360]  This is actually something that's happened a lot within the United States.
[36:44.360 --> 36:51.720]  We have a great history of vaccinated children spreading the disease to the unvaccinated
[36:51.720 --> 36:59.160]  population, but also surprisingly, other children can contract the disease even if
[36:59.160 --> 37:00.720]  they've been vaccinated.
[37:00.720 --> 37:06.440]  This small Pacific nation is in a state of emergency, red flags telling special teams
[37:06.440 --> 37:09.880]  which houses have non-vaccinated residents.
[37:09.880 --> 37:13.000]  It's a really good thing in terms of actually going door to door.
[37:13.000 --> 37:17.160]  Today we have to call up the ambulance and now they've been evacuated.
[37:17.160 --> 37:19.080]  Measles has taken hold in Samoa.
[37:19.080 --> 37:26.280]  Missions now are becoming very severe, unlike the status of the first few admissions.
[37:26.280 --> 37:33.320]  I don't know how they are getting it, so it has to come from something that's not proper.
[37:33.320 --> 37:36.720]  So there's investigation going on.
[37:36.720 --> 37:41.520]  So let's see some examples of vaccine shedding happening within the United States.
[37:41.520 --> 37:47.440]  This article from Science says, Measles outbreak traced to fully vaccinated patients for the
[37:47.440 --> 37:48.440]  first time.
[37:48.440 --> 37:55.600]  Now, we know that, you know, the mainstream media lies and science is no different.
[37:55.600 --> 38:02.800]  We know that there have been previous cases of fully vaccinated patients causing outbreaks.
[38:02.800 --> 38:08.560]  But here is one case mainstream media like to talk about.
[38:08.560 --> 38:15.440]  Another case was published on CNBC, which stated, public health officials know recently
[38:15.440 --> 38:18.120]  vaccinated individuals spread the disease.
[38:18.120 --> 38:21.920]  So suddenly it's a new thing.
[38:21.920 --> 38:28.400]  Suddenly it's known that the vaccinated populations are spreading the disease to those that are
[38:28.400 --> 38:33.960]  vulnerable and have also already been vaccinated.
[38:33.960 --> 38:41.760]  An interesting story comes from the Texas city that hosts Texas A&M called Corpus Christi,
[38:41.760 --> 38:46.040]  which means literally the body of Christ.
[38:46.040 --> 38:50.720]  The news that came out of there was that 14 adolescent age students contracted the measles
[38:50.720 --> 38:55.960]  despite having been injected with the MMR vaccine.
[38:55.960 --> 39:01.440]  Researchers noted that more than 99% of students at the school had also been vaccinated with
[39:01.440 --> 39:06.600]  more than 95% of them showing detectable antibodies to measles.
[39:06.600 --> 39:14.000]  OK, what's clear about this is that we can probably make the assumption that a requirement
[39:14.000 --> 39:19.960]  for going to school in this town was to be vaccinated.
[39:19.960 --> 39:24.120]  99% vaccination rates are incredibly high.
[39:24.120 --> 39:31.360]  And yet, despite such an amazing amount of people vaccinated, they still caught the disease
[39:31.360 --> 39:34.840]  and had an outbreak.
[39:34.840 --> 39:39.800]  Another story here, an outbreak of measles among persons with prior evidence of immunity,
[39:39.800 --> 39:41.880]  New York City, 2011.
[39:41.880 --> 39:48.400]  Suddenly, all these cases start coming out where people that have been vaccinated are
[39:48.400 --> 39:51.960]  catching the disease and spreading it to others.
[39:51.960 --> 39:56.240]  This is one of the things that they don't want to tell you now about in the mainstream
[39:56.240 --> 40:02.880]  media, which is that most of these outbreaks and most of the people contracting measles
[40:02.880 --> 40:08.720]  in this day and age within the first world country have already been vaccinated.
[40:08.720 --> 40:16.160]  The question then becomes, if vaccines are so ineffective, especially the measles vaccine,
[40:16.160 --> 40:23.640]  then why do they feel that there is a drive and the institution of martial law in places
[40:23.640 --> 40:27.920]  like Samoa in order to force vaccinate every single person?
[40:27.920 --> 40:28.920]  Hi, Natalie.
[40:28.920 --> 40:29.920]  Hi.
[40:29.920 --> 40:30.920]  Hi.
[40:30.920 --> 40:35.280]  You're saying your daughter had measles, are you worried about your other children?
[40:35.280 --> 40:42.040]  Basically, my daughter, she's 18 months, and she came out in measles a week after I
[40:42.040 --> 40:43.840]  gave birth to my young guest.
[40:43.840 --> 40:44.840]  Right.
[40:44.840 --> 40:49.680]  And she's only just really got over it, she's had it about three weeks, and I wanted to
[40:49.680 --> 40:53.520]  know why she'd got it when she's already had her vaccines and everything.
[40:53.520 --> 40:58.920]  Oh, that's interesting, so she had the NLR vaccine, so why did she get it?
[40:58.920 --> 41:03.680]  Okay, so the routine MMR vaccine schedule in this country is one dose at about a year
[41:03.680 --> 41:06.840]  of age and another dose between three to five years.
[41:06.840 --> 41:13.320]  Your first vaccine dose will protect 90% of people, so nine out of ten, and for whatever
[41:13.320 --> 41:17.800]  reason, there will be a small number of people who don't mount enough of a response, enough
[41:17.800 --> 41:22.320]  of an immune response to it, and that's what the second vaccine dose is there for.
[41:22.320 --> 41:26.840]  So that brings you up to 99% of people will be protected, so there's a tiny number of
[41:26.840 --> 41:31.560]  people that will still potentially get the illness if they've had a dose of vaccine.
[41:31.560 --> 41:37.080]  So the question remains, was this outbreak that happened in Samoa caused by the vaccination
[41:37.080 --> 41:38.840]  drive that happened?
[41:38.840 --> 41:47.040]  The answer to that lies in studying the cases of measles that emerge and genotyping the virus,
[41:47.040 --> 41:51.720]  and seeing if the measles virus that's been infecting those in the outbreak is the same
[41:51.720 --> 41:56.380]  as the ones being given for vaccination.
[41:56.380 --> 42:04.000]  So RFK asked this exact question, and he stated with a letter sent to the PM, he asked if
[42:04.000 --> 42:10.920]  they could do an analysis to determine if they, Samoa, are dealing with a vaccine strain
[42:10.920 --> 42:19.360]  as in the Disneyland outbreak or a mutant strain that is vaccine resistant, i.e. a new
[42:19.360 --> 42:24.360]  virulent strain that has evolved to evade the vaccine.
[42:24.360 --> 42:31.440]  He says, we also don't know the ages of the casualties or their vaccine status.
[42:31.440 --> 42:37.680]  Keep in mind that the outbreak occurred at the height of a super aggressive vaccination
[42:37.680 --> 42:39.920]  campaign.
[42:39.920 --> 42:45.080]  The mortalities may have been aggravated by the use of panadol, which is the generic
[42:45.080 --> 42:52.920]  form of Tylenol in that country, which should be contradicted, that means we should not
[42:52.920 --> 42:59.760]  use it, and the failure to administer vitamin A.
[42:59.760 --> 43:07.120]  I spend a lot of time reminding the M4s, the family of listeners and viewers that without
[43:07.120 --> 43:10.640]  you we won't be on the air, and I spend a lot of time thanking you.

[43:14.800 --> 43:19.040]  the world for the better and raising the alarm as modern ball reveres, but something I should
[43:19.040 --> 43:25.440]  spend more time on is just reminding you that these products are really amazing.
[43:25.440 --> 43:28.700]  You've got that pledge from me, but you've seen the third-party test out there, the air
[43:28.700 --> 43:33.480]  filtration, the water filtration, the supplements are all the very best you're going to find
[43:33.480 --> 43:34.480]  out there.

[45:01.880 --> 45:05.080]  A little less than four months ago, I made the announcement on air.
[45:05.080 --> 45:10.560]  I said, hey, I have a tendency to take the high quality supplements from InfoWarsLife
[45:10.560 --> 45:15.240]  for a while, get great results, and then slowly I stop using them.
[45:15.240 --> 45:17.280]  I forget to religiously take them.
[45:17.280 --> 45:22.840]  I'm going to religiously take the supplements for the next few months, and I've lost almost
[45:22.840 --> 45:24.600]  40 pounds now.
[45:24.600 --> 45:25.920]  Everybody can see it on air.
[45:25.920 --> 45:27.800]  My energy is off the charts.
[45:27.800 --> 45:32.280]  Everything is amazing, and it's because I am taking the InfoWarsLife products, the
[45:32.280 --> 45:33.280]  Krill Oil.
[45:33.280 --> 45:35.880]  I'm taking the X2 and the X3.
[45:35.880 --> 45:40.160]  I'm taking the Brainforce Plus when I work out, when I have to work really late.
[45:40.160 --> 45:42.480]  I'm taking half a pack of TurboForce.
[45:42.480 --> 45:44.800]  It is clean energy.
[45:44.800 --> 45:48.200]  It is really making my whole life so much more enjoyable.
[45:48.200 --> 45:50.120]  It's making the shows more focused.
[45:50.120 --> 45:51.480]  I've got more energy.
[45:51.480 --> 45:55.600]  We have huge sales going right now for the new year at InfoWarsLife.com, a big clearance
[45:55.600 --> 45:56.600]  sale.
[45:56.600 --> 46:00.800]  Take advantage of it all at InfoWarsLife.com.
[46:00.800 --> 46:04.600]  It was about three and a half months ago, and I said on air, I'm going to religiously
[46:04.600 --> 46:05.760]  take my supplements.
[46:05.760 --> 46:09.560]  I'd always taken them in the past, but I forget like everybody else to stay on the regimen.
[46:09.560 --> 46:15.480]  Well, I've done it, and I've lost 39 pounds in less than four months, and my life is so
[46:15.480 --> 46:16.480]  amazing.
[46:16.480 --> 46:19.800]  I still have cake and ice cream and pie, just like I did before.
[46:19.800 --> 46:25.440]  I'm exercising the same amount, but my body has the trace elements and the key things
[46:25.440 --> 46:28.760]  it needs, like the Clean Eye Dye and X2 and X3.
[46:28.760 --> 46:33.600]  I take a good energy booster like TurboForce and Brainforce for my brain, and I take the
[46:33.600 --> 46:37.440]  fish oil, and I take the turmeric, and I take the knockout, and I use the good toothpaste.
[46:37.440 --> 46:41.040]  It's fluoride free, it's got the tea tree oil and so much more, at InfoWarsLife.com.
[46:41.040 --> 46:45.160]  2020 is dawning, we have big sales, total clearance right now.

[46:48.800 --> 46:52.840]  yourself and fund the InfoWare, a total 360 win going into 2020.
[46:52.840 --> 46:57.240]  That's why it's more important than ever to keep InfoWars on the air, and only you can
[46:57.240 --> 47:03.600]  do that by getting great products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[47:03.600 --> 47:32.360]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:32.360 --> 47:37.160]  We have heard these types of reports from people on the ground, but have no verification
[47:37.160 --> 47:43.640]  as health ministry and the WHO have continued the country on lockdown.
[47:43.640 --> 47:50.840]  So I want to talk quickly about Panadol, Acetamiafin, Tylenol.
[47:50.840 --> 47:57.320]  These are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories that are given to people with fever or if
[47:57.320 --> 48:05.120]  they're suffering from pain, and one of the problems with giving Acetamiafin is that if
[48:05.120 --> 48:12.880]  you are low on a substance called glutathione, then the metabolism of Acetamiafin goes through
[48:12.880 --> 48:16.400]  a dangerously toxic pathway.
[48:16.400 --> 48:22.520]  The problem with many of these people that are suffering from measles severely is that
[48:22.520 --> 48:29.760]  their glutathione levels are artificially low because their liver is fighting the disease.
[48:29.760 --> 48:37.640]  As a result, given Tylenol or Panadol or Acetamiafin, they're really all the same thing, these
[48:37.640 --> 48:46.520]  children will undergo a very toxic reaction, and their liver will begin to shut down.
[48:46.520 --> 48:51.840]  Another contributing factor to the high death rate for measles is a lack of vitamin A, common
[48:51.840 --> 48:52.840]  in the third world.
[48:52.840 --> 48:58.600]  In fact, the World Health Organization has stated that if you have severe measles, then
[48:58.600 --> 49:03.520]  you need to take high doses of vitamin A throughout the duration of your sickness.
[49:03.520 --> 49:12.160]  In fact, vitamin A deficiency is recognized as a huge risk factor for severe measles.
[49:12.160 --> 49:17.920]  What's really horrible about this whole situation is the fact that parents were directed by
[49:17.920 --> 49:26.720]  doctors and newspapers within Samoa to be giving their children this Panadol, and there
[49:26.720 --> 49:34.840]  was no indication that they should take vitamin A as far as we've been able to hear.
[49:34.840 --> 49:39.160]  This directive was confirmed by the Samoan Observer, which directed that children with
[49:39.160 --> 49:42.440]  measles should take Panadol.
[49:42.440 --> 49:50.160]  The results that followed were predictable. By December 2019, a nightmarish report began
[49:50.160 --> 49:55.080]  to surface on social media, and then more, and then more.
[49:55.080 --> 50:02.440]  For example, this was grabbed from Facebook that said, tomorrow, Samoa will begin compulsory
[50:02.440 --> 50:04.360]  mass vaccinations.
[50:04.360 --> 50:09.120]  Every single person will be vaccinated unless they could provide medical documentation to
[50:09.120 --> 50:13.160]  prove they have already had their shots.
[50:13.160 --> 50:16.520]  No one will be allowed to leave their property.
[50:16.520 --> 50:20.200]  No one will be allowed to access public roads.
[50:20.200 --> 50:22.880]  All businesses will be shut down.
[50:22.880 --> 50:28.520]  The government will be shut down, and anyone that isn't vaccinated is being asked to nail
[50:28.520 --> 50:31.640]  a red cloth to the front door.
[50:31.640 --> 50:36.480]  If this doesn't scare you, then you are completely insane.
[50:36.480 --> 50:39.400]  This is just a test run for what's to come.
[50:39.400 --> 50:41.960]  This is the beginning of the end.
[50:41.960 --> 50:48.000]  Martial law is coming, and people need to start waking up, and I completely agree.
[50:48.000 --> 50:52.420]  One of the things we have to look for is what's going to happen with the United States.
[50:52.420 --> 50:57.880]  We see that there's a lot of vaccine pushes that are coming to the state of California,
[50:57.880 --> 51:04.800]  to the state of New York, and then just recently, this month, December 2019, was a huge push
[51:04.800 --> 51:14.080]  for increased vaccination within New Jersey and the elimination of medical exemptions.
[51:14.080 --> 51:17.640]  More media reports showed up such as this.
[51:17.640 --> 51:22.200]  In response to the vitamin protocols that started to become widely circulated across
[51:22.200 --> 51:26.560]  Sumo and social media, and this person says, thank you, thank you, thank you.
[51:26.560 --> 51:29.040]  I am here in Sumo with my children.
[51:29.040 --> 51:35.160]  We are scared for reading your page and seeing people research our vaccines has given me
[51:35.160 --> 51:36.240]  hope.
[51:36.240 --> 51:42.000]  No one is researching here, but vaccinated people are getting sick, and many babies are
[51:42.000 --> 51:43.000]  dying.
[51:43.000 --> 51:47.440]  There's something really wrong here, and I'm sure it has everything to do with the vaccine
[51:47.440 --> 51:52.480]  and deliberate biological warfare, because now they've introduced a mandatory vaccine
[51:52.480 --> 52:01.400]  schedule where every Sumoan baby will receive six, six different shots before they're one
[52:01.400 --> 52:02.400]  year old.
[52:02.400 --> 52:07.160]  Now, if you get a shot and you get a vaccine, it's going to be like this.
[52:07.160 --> 52:10.760]  They're going to put it in to your body, and they're going to be able to take it as an
[52:10.760 --> 52:11.760]  adult.
[52:11.760 --> 52:14.640]  Now, imagine that you're a child.
[52:14.640 --> 52:23.840]  You're tiny, that vaccine, because the equivalent of a beer can of substance getting pushed
[52:23.840 --> 52:25.640]  into your fat.
[52:25.640 --> 52:30.280]  That's what babies are having to do, times six.
[52:30.280 --> 52:33.960]  The deaths were exploited by anti-vax campaigners.
[52:33.960 --> 52:40.600]  This so-called anti-vaxer Edwin Tamaseze is now under arrest, charged with incitement
[52:40.600 --> 52:42.680]  against a government.
[52:42.680 --> 52:48.080]  Even on Thursday, he had promoted the use of vitamin C to cure the disease.
[52:48.080 --> 52:53.560]  The World Health Organization says misinformation like this is the reason almost 10 million
[52:53.560 --> 52:57.080]  people contracted measles last year.
[52:57.080 --> 53:00.440]  So imagine this is happening to you.
[53:00.440 --> 53:02.800]  There is martial law.
[53:02.800 --> 53:08.680]  People are forced to vaccinate their children, and the children are getting sick.
[53:08.680 --> 53:10.480]  Some of them are dying.
[53:10.480 --> 53:18.520]  A man by the name of Edwin Tamaseze decided that he was going to investigate and figure
[53:18.520 --> 53:21.840]  out why so many children were getting sick.
[53:21.840 --> 53:27.080]  Edwin is an entrepreneur, and he figured out that many children were dying because of a
[53:27.080 --> 53:32.640]  combination, a panadol, and vitamin A deficiency.
[53:32.640 --> 53:38.840]  He worked with several religious organizations throughout the U.S., and thanks to him, hundreds,
[53:38.840 --> 53:41.440]  not thousands of lives were saved.
[53:41.440 --> 53:43.280]  How did he do this?
[53:43.280 --> 53:48.800]  He worked with LDS members and people from the Mormon Church to bring in vitamin A and
[53:48.800 --> 53:55.560]  vitamin C and have it delivered to Samoa, and then he began distributing it to parents
[53:55.560 --> 53:57.360]  and children.
[53:57.360 --> 53:59.760]  What happened was remarkable.
[53:59.760 --> 54:07.600]  Children that were deathly ill were recovering and making full recoveries in about a day.
[54:07.600 --> 54:14.000]  The results were miraculous, but unfortunately, the videos and the images that were coming
[54:14.000 --> 54:20.280]  out from the social media profile lifted the eye of officials, and as a result, there
[54:20.280 --> 54:24.720]  started to be a commotion within the United States as parents here in the United States
[54:24.720 --> 54:30.920]  were horrified at the images coming out and the complete ineptitude of the government
[54:30.920 --> 54:39.760]  in allowing common known medicines that could harm a child and that these medicines were
[54:39.760 --> 54:41.400]  being given to the child.
[54:41.400 --> 54:48.360]  And so as a result, Edwin was arrested, brought into jail, and then at first denied bail.
[54:48.360 --> 54:53.240]  As a result, we started seeing posts like this as a result saying, I just saw posts
[54:53.240 --> 54:56.560]  on a few babies being saved with the vitamin protocol.
[54:56.560 --> 55:02.200]  Sadly, one who just died because she didn't know about it, heartbroken.
[55:02.200 --> 55:03.680]  It's very heavy.
[55:03.680 --> 55:05.160]  Pray for the families.
[55:05.160 --> 55:10.520]  Pray more people learn about what to do and get the donated supplements through Edwin.
[55:10.520 --> 55:13.280]  And all those saying just get the MMR shot.
[55:13.280 --> 55:17.040]  Notice below her knees had it and still got the measles.
[55:17.040 --> 55:22.760]  She still got the measles.
[55:22.760 --> 55:29.600]  There are a few other young children who were up to date and they still got measles, which
[55:29.600 --> 55:32.760]  as I said, is a vaccine failure.
[55:32.760 --> 55:38.480]  Edwin Tamasisi, a Simonian manufacturer, has been vocal on social media about his doubts
[55:38.480 --> 55:42.640]  on the efficacy of the vaccine.
[55:42.640 --> 55:47.480]  Stuff journalist Florence Kerr caught up with Mr. Tamasisi in Apia to question him about
[55:47.480 --> 55:48.480]  his beliefs.
[55:48.480 --> 55:54.040]  It's horrible when you see these kids, the hospital is too full and they're just being
[55:54.040 --> 55:57.320]  passed back into the community to die.
[55:57.320 --> 56:03.960]  It's really distressing and that's why I've taken it upon myself to be that person who
[56:03.960 --> 56:06.920]  can hopefully give them the hope that they'll be alright.
[56:06.920 --> 56:11.320]  So right now, you haven't got any fix to make that up.
[56:11.320 --> 56:13.600]  We've only got anecdotal evidence.
[56:13.600 --> 56:15.800]  Yes, anecdotal but there's nothing there.
[56:15.800 --> 56:18.600]  We need that and that's what we need, that's the biggest fact.
[56:18.600 --> 56:22.000]  So if families came up to you and asked for your opinion on getting the vaccine, your
[56:22.000 --> 56:24.960]  opinion, what would you tell them right now?
[56:24.960 --> 56:25.960]  My personal opinion?
[56:25.960 --> 56:26.960]  Yeah.
[56:26.960 --> 56:28.520]  At this point in time, I wouldn't say anything.
[56:28.520 --> 56:34.440]  All I say to them is, I cannot make any comment on that and that's all I say because it's
[56:34.440 --> 56:35.440]  very risky.
[56:35.440 --> 56:39.640]  Yes or no, do you have fix to prove that this vaccine is substandard?
[56:39.640 --> 56:40.640]  We're building.
[56:40.640 --> 56:41.640]  So.
[56:41.640 --> 56:42.640]  We're building the facts.
[56:42.640 --> 56:43.640]  No.
[56:43.640 --> 56:48.520]  I'm not going to answer the question now.
[56:48.520 --> 56:50.720]  Could you produce right now?
[56:50.720 --> 56:51.720]  Me?
[56:51.720 --> 56:52.720]  Yeah.
[56:52.720 --> 56:55.680]  I could actually, I could show you my books because I've been writing the diary so if
[56:55.680 --> 57:00.640]  you're visiting the people and the vaccine, the vaccine patent, I could actually show
[57:00.640 --> 57:01.640]  you that if you like.
[57:01.640 --> 57:02.640]  Okay.
[57:02.640 --> 57:08.440]  And that for me tells me that the vaccine that we're using has an issue.
[57:08.440 --> 57:13.040]  And to hear more about this, we're going to go to Miriam Henein who is following the
[57:13.040 --> 57:14.560]  situation on the ground.
[57:14.560 --> 57:15.560]  Miriam?
[57:15.560 --> 57:16.560]  Hi, Zach.
[57:16.560 --> 57:24.120]  Been covering the Samoan supposed measles outbreak now for more than a week.
[57:24.120 --> 57:31.440]  Trying to get information from different sources and calling different, calling the Samoan
[57:31.440 --> 57:38.320]  government, calling Merck, trying to reach out to Edwin to Mossay on Facebook, although
[57:38.320 --> 57:42.280]  he's no longer allowed to make any posts on social media.
[57:42.280 --> 57:44.160]  We'll be right back.
[57:44.160 --> 57:49.200]  We're live the first day of 2020.
[57:49.200 --> 57:52.960]  Just during the break, I went and got a delicious cup, a second cup of the day.
[57:52.960 --> 57:53.960]  It's really strong.
[57:53.960 --> 57:57.800]  I shouldn't do this because all work and no playmates jack a really aggressive boy and
[57:57.800 --> 58:02.760]  the coffee has to wake up America coffee there by loves highest rated in the choppers mountains.
[58:02.760 --> 58:04.960]  It's beyond Mexican coffee, beyond Guatemalan coffee.
[58:04.960 --> 58:05.960]  It's the best coffee in the world.
[58:05.960 --> 58:08.800]  It's right on the border between the two countries in those rainforests.
[58:08.800 --> 58:12.880]  When selected, it's beyond organic, wildcrafted, wake up America coffee.
[58:12.880 --> 58:14.200]  People are blown away by how good it is.
[58:14.200 --> 58:18.320]  Same stuff sold in Whole Foods under another name for $30 for the same size container.
[58:18.320 --> 58:21.560]  Yes, folks, we've been selling it 10 years, never raised the price.
[58:21.560 --> 58:23.560]  1995 is that big old bag.
[58:23.560 --> 58:28.560]  99% reviews, 598 reviews, 4.9 stars on third party sites.
[58:28.560 --> 58:31.520]  Sign up for auto ship additional 10% off, get it auto delivered to you, so don't forget
[58:31.520 --> 58:33.080]  to get it each month or every two months.
[58:33.080 --> 58:36.680]  You can click out to nine months whenever you want the new order coming in, 15 days
[58:36.680 --> 58:37.680]  of nine months.
[58:37.680 --> 58:44.160]  The Patriots blend medium roast only has a 98% out of 814 reviews.
[58:44.160 --> 58:46.160]  It's not as popular.
[58:46.160 --> 59:00.240]  Anyways, it's all at infowarsstore.com Well, here we are in the year 2020.
[59:00.240 --> 59:02.320]  And old friends are not forgotten.
[59:02.320 --> 59:05.120]  You the Patriots have kept him for wars on the air.
[59:05.120 --> 59:06.120]  Thank you so much.
[59:06.120 --> 59:09.920]  I don't want the globalist to win for my children's future, for your children's future, but also
[59:09.920 --> 59:13.160]  I just personally don't want them to be able to shut us down.
[59:13.160 --> 59:16.600]  And thanks to you spreading the word and buying the products, we are able to stay on air.

[59:43.640 --> 59:46.440]  But whatever you do, remember, 2020 is a critical year.
[59:46.440 --> 59:53.040]  So everybody get the word out and fight for freedom.
[59:53.040 --> 1:00:12.600]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:12.600 --> 1:00:22.080]  What I've heard is that Edwin has been distributing vitamin A and vitamin C and telling parents
[1:00:22.080 --> 1:00:28.720]  they should not give penidol, the generic form of Tylenol, because it is toxic to people
[1:00:28.720 --> 1:00:32.440]  that are undergoing a measles fever.
[1:00:32.440 --> 1:00:34.520]  What can you say about that?
[1:00:34.520 --> 1:00:46.720]  Well, I can say that vitamin A and vitamin C have been documented as legitimate vitamins
[1:00:46.720 --> 1:00:50.600]  to help people with a measles outbreak.
[1:00:50.600 --> 1:00:58.680]  The INH has a study on vitamin A. Vitamin A helps with your immune, plays a role in
[1:00:58.680 --> 1:01:00.440]  the immune modulation.
[1:01:00.440 --> 1:01:03.720]  It's a substrate for preserving cell integrity.
[1:01:03.720 --> 1:01:06.960]  It's well known, vitamin C as well.
[1:01:06.960 --> 1:01:12.880]  Initially I made the mistake of thinking he was arrested for administering vitamins, but
[1:01:12.880 --> 1:01:20.000]  he was arrested for speaking about administering vitamins and also talking smack.
[1:01:20.000 --> 1:01:26.560]  So basically, there was one post where he stated, I'll be here to mop up your mess.
[1:01:26.560 --> 1:01:31.120]  Enjoy your killing spree.
[1:01:31.120 --> 1:01:35.120]  And so the Simone officials didn't like that one bit, did they?
[1:01:35.120 --> 1:01:36.720]  No, they did not.
[1:01:36.720 --> 1:01:43.480]  I don't know what their policies are for freedom of speech over there, but maybe they're on
[1:01:43.480 --> 1:01:46.280]  par with what's happening here in this country.
[1:01:46.280 --> 1:01:48.040]  So they released him on bail.
[1:01:48.040 --> 1:01:53.680]  He's set to return to court in April 2020.
[1:01:53.680 --> 1:01:58.600]  And one of the conditions is not to post about the measles, although I don't know if he's
[1:01:58.600 --> 1:02:00.520]  allowed to post at all.
[1:02:00.520 --> 1:02:05.960]  And then another criteria is that he's not allowed to give vitamins.
[1:02:05.960 --> 1:02:13.640]  But that's the irony that if you look at the first epidemic in Samoa in 1893, there were
[1:02:13.640 --> 1:02:23.600]  no deaths and it was well known that this can be healed with diet and the children of
[1:02:23.600 --> 1:02:30.400]  Samoa are malnourished and there is definitely nutritional deficiencies that need to be addressed.
[1:02:30.400 --> 1:02:34.680]  There are signs tonight that Samoa is clamping down on an anti-vaccination movement.
[1:02:34.680 --> 1:02:38.120]  The nation's most prominent anti-vaxxer has become the first to be charged under new
[1:02:38.120 --> 1:02:43.560]  emergency laws, but his actions are just part of a secretive underground operation.
[1:02:43.560 --> 1:02:47.440]  Our Pacific correspondent Barbara Driva reports from Apia.
[1:02:47.440 --> 1:02:51.960]  Anti-vaxxer Edwin Tamasece, free at least for now after being kept in custody since his
[1:02:51.960 --> 1:02:53.520]  arrest last week.
[1:02:53.520 --> 1:02:58.480]  The first to be charged under Samoa's strict emergency laws for anti-vaxx comments.
[1:02:58.480 --> 1:03:00.760]  His arrest making everyone cautious.
[1:03:00.760 --> 1:03:03.800]  I can't talk to you because I have to get the police to come back.
[1:03:03.800 --> 1:03:08.640]  Mr. Tamasece has been treating measles patients with vitamins provided by international anti-vaxx
[1:03:08.640 --> 1:03:14.520]  groups and encouraging patients not to get their children vaccinated or give them antibiotics.
[1:03:14.520 --> 1:03:21.720]  In total, over 100,000 people in Samoa were vaccinated in the latest drive.
[1:03:21.720 --> 1:03:28.120]  Evidence and accusations of a corporate cover-up are running rampant and the scenes of military
[1:03:28.120 --> 1:03:34.440]  and big pharma collusion are now burned into those that have followed this event.
[1:03:34.440 --> 1:03:41.340]  We here in the United States wonder silently whether this can happen here, whether it is
[1:03:41.340 --> 1:03:42.340]  inevitable.
[1:03:42.340 --> 1:03:50.560]  But rest assured, we here at Infowars are going to be continuing to monitor this story here
[1:03:50.560 --> 1:03:51.560]  and abroad.
[1:03:51.560 --> 1:04:19.760]  Thank you for joining me for this very special edition of Infowars.
[1:04:19.760 --> 1:04:37.200]  Do you want to join me in this special edition of Infowars, or do you want to join me in
[1:04:37.200 --> 1:04:49.200]  this special edition of Infowars?
[1:04:49.200 --> 1:04:57.960]  Let us know in the comments below.
[1:04:57.960 --> 1:05:04.520]  In the year 2020, crazed leftists are literally crawling out of their political graves and
[1:05:04.520 --> 1:05:09.480]  attacking Americans that dare not submit to their bullying.
[1:05:09.480 --> 1:05:16.760]  2020 is here, and despite all the globalist efforts, thanks to you the listeners and viewers,
[1:05:16.760 --> 1:05:20.280]  Infowars is still on the air in 2020.
[1:05:20.280 --> 1:05:25.080]  So remember, it's a great way to get healthy and get in shape and focus your mind with
[1:05:25.080 --> 1:05:28.780]  the products of Infowarslife.com and fund the Infowar.
[1:05:28.780 --> 1:05:30.280]  It's a total 360 win.
[1:05:30.280 --> 1:05:32.280]  All you've got to do is take action.
[1:05:32.280 --> 1:05:35.280]  The only way we fail is if you don't take action.
[1:05:35.280 --> 1:05:37.040]  These are amazing products.
[1:05:37.040 --> 1:05:42.400]  Infowarslife.com is more essential than ever to get high quality products to boost your
[1:05:42.400 --> 1:05:48.400]  mental and physical lifestyle, clarity, and so much more, and it funds the Infowar.
[1:05:48.400 --> 1:05:56.560]  Infowarslife.com, Infowarslife.com, into the year 2020, 2020, and Infowarslife.com.
[1:05:56.560 --> 1:06:23.560]  Take action now.
[1:06:26.560 --> 1:06:52.800]  It's fitting that the battle for America's future is being fought in Texas, and the battle
[1:06:52.800 --> 1:06:55.280]  for the future of the world is being fought in America.
[1:06:55.280 --> 1:07:00.920]  It's been said for a long time that as Texas goes, the United States goes, and as America
[1:07:00.920 --> 1:07:02.920]  goes, the world goes.
[1:07:02.920 --> 1:07:03.920]  God put me here.
[1:07:03.920 --> 1:07:10.520]  I was born here for this mission, and I'm very honored to be here, the native son of
[1:07:10.520 --> 1:07:16.480]  Texas, native son of America, standing up to the globalist with you, most amazing people
[1:07:16.480 --> 1:07:17.480]  out there.
[1:07:17.480 --> 1:07:18.480]  All right.
[1:07:18.480 --> 1:07:24.880]  Let me hit the top story, and if you understand this, you understand everything.
[1:07:24.880 --> 1:07:25.880]  It's a Rosetta Stone.
[1:07:25.880 --> 1:07:26.880]  It's one of those skeleton keys.
[1:07:26.880 --> 1:07:30.600]  It's one of those windows into reality.
[1:07:30.600 --> 1:07:35.080]  Last night, I was at my parents' house for New Year's.
[1:07:35.080 --> 1:07:37.840]  That way, my youngest daughter can go to sleep early at their place.
[1:07:37.840 --> 1:07:44.200]  We can still stay up till the New Year and bring in this momentous year of 2020.
[1:07:44.200 --> 1:07:49.240]  And about 10 o'clock, I start getting all these text messages saying, hey, really sorry
[1:07:49.240 --> 1:07:50.240]  for you.
[1:07:50.240 --> 1:07:51.240]  Hang in there.
[1:07:51.240 --> 1:07:59.120]  I love you, just dozens of texts coming in, and then Rob Dube, his older son, shows up
[1:07:59.120 --> 1:08:06.400]  and he goes, man, I saw you on the top of Google without even looking.
[1:08:06.400 --> 1:08:08.960]  And then somebody else walks up to the campfire.
[1:08:08.960 --> 1:08:11.200]  My parents got a couple acres.
[1:08:11.200 --> 1:08:16.680]  It was like a little piece of country right in the city, and says, yeah, you're on the
[1:08:16.680 --> 1:08:19.520]  top of Yahoo.
[1:08:19.520 --> 1:08:25.240]  And then I walk in the house and go upstairs, and there's a TV on in the little library,
[1:08:25.240 --> 1:08:30.240]  and it's got the local news station on, and I'm on the TV.
[1:08:30.240 --> 1:08:36.720]  And it's all how I've been defeated and how I'm a loser and how I'm a bad man.
[1:08:36.720 --> 1:08:45.040]  Like the globalists were having wartime propaganda of a country they were going to be invaded.
[1:08:45.040 --> 1:08:52.920]  And so I left my phone back in that study, and I went back and got it, and I said, well,
[1:08:52.920 --> 1:08:53.920]  let me just go through it.
[1:08:53.920 --> 1:08:59.160]  And I was going through the text I was getting, and it was the top story all over the place.
[1:08:59.160 --> 1:09:00.840]  And you know, that's concerted.
[1:09:00.840 --> 1:09:05.600]  That's organized to ring in 2020.
[1:09:05.600 --> 1:09:13.080]  They sat on a judge's ruling in Texas from December 20th that I never even talked about.
[1:09:13.080 --> 1:09:18.760]  And then they misrepresented all of it deceptively as well.
[1:09:18.760 --> 1:09:23.880]  And again, that just means that as we're ringing in the new year, they sat on a story
[1:09:23.880 --> 1:09:27.160]  for 11 days.
[1:09:27.160 --> 1:09:30.720]  And then as they knew people were going to go to their TV sets and go to their phones
[1:09:30.720 --> 1:09:34.120]  to see what was happening and people were sending each other messages, they wanted to
[1:09:34.120 --> 1:09:40.680]  show Alex Jones in trouble and Alex Jones as a loser.
[1:09:40.680 --> 1:09:49.280]  And I thought about that last night, and I just felt so good, not even proud, but just
[1:09:49.280 --> 1:09:58.440]  good like I'd run a marathon and I'd made it across the finish line in first place.
[1:09:58.440 --> 1:10:05.840]  Because when basically every channel was hitting me from every angle that I'm a loser and I'm
[1:10:05.840 --> 1:10:09.960]  a failure and I'm a bad person, it means we're doing something right.
[1:10:09.960 --> 1:10:15.920]  It means we're covering issues and things that hit right on the target.
[1:10:15.920 --> 1:10:19.960]  It means we're over the target.
[1:10:19.960 --> 1:10:24.320]  Incredible.
[1:10:24.320 --> 1:10:26.800]  And then sure enough, I went and looked this morning.
[1:10:26.800 --> 1:10:31.080]  It was on CNN last night when they actually have ratings when people are tuning in to
[1:10:31.080 --> 1:10:34.120]  watch the ball drop, they were, oh, let's cut to some news.
[1:10:34.120 --> 1:10:38.360]  Oh, Alex Jones lost a Sandy Hook lawsuit.
[1:10:38.360 --> 1:10:45.480]  Alex Jones as a loser, making Sandy Hook my identity with people, oh, that's the Sandy
[1:10:45.480 --> 1:10:49.840]  Hook guy, but everybody knows now when they impeach somebody or they indict somebody or
[1:10:49.840 --> 1:10:55.920]  they attack somebody, all the thinking folks go, man, this guy must be good.
[1:10:55.920 --> 1:10:59.520]  And the support that poured in has just been unbelievable.
[1:10:59.520 --> 1:11:05.280]  In fact, monetarily, we've been behind in fundraising for the operation of the year,
[1:11:05.280 --> 1:11:13.280]  but man, last night, $300,000 extra came in without us even asking and it came in right
[1:11:13.280 --> 1:11:15.360]  when those stories broke.
[1:11:15.360 --> 1:11:17.480]  They put that out at about nine, ten at night.
[1:11:17.480 --> 1:11:27.520]  They pushed it and money just poured in, making it to where we brought in more money this
[1:11:27.520 --> 1:11:34.080]  December than we brought in last December and it was the only other month in the year
[1:11:34.080 --> 1:11:38.640]  was November that we brought in more money than we brought in in 2018, thanks to you.
[1:11:38.640 --> 1:11:41.600]  And people got it and they understood it.
[1:11:41.600 --> 1:11:48.440]  And I got up this morning and the office manager said, look at this number, $300,000 on top
[1:11:48.440 --> 1:11:54.840]  of the regular sales came in because people got it when they went, my God, he's on every
[1:11:54.840 --> 1:11:56.240]  channel being attacked.
[1:11:56.240 --> 1:12:00.400]  They said, we know you're attacking somebody standing up for us and we're standing with
[1:12:00.400 --> 1:12:01.400]  him.
[1:12:01.400 --> 1:12:05.120]  And, you know, before I even knew that last night, I felt incredibly bullied by it.
[1:12:05.120 --> 1:12:11.840]  And I said, man, if I'm on every channel, these evil people that cover up pedophilia
[1:12:11.840 --> 1:12:16.480]  and cover up corruption and cover up radical Islam and cover up and promote mass shootings
[1:12:16.480 --> 1:12:23.480]  when they know it causes them, these bad people hate my guts and I'm inside their head and
[1:12:23.480 --> 1:12:29.360]  they've got their whole controlled media lined up for days with a ruling that was in the
[1:12:29.360 --> 1:12:32.640]  local news 12 days ago.
[1:12:32.640 --> 1:12:37.560]  And that's all they got.
[1:12:37.560 --> 1:12:42.600]  All the glory goes to God, but God works through you and so I want to thank you out there.
[1:12:42.600 --> 1:12:45.200]  Amazing job.
[1:12:45.200 --> 1:12:52.040]  Now Mike Adams prepared a really big show and I told him a few days ago, I said, you
[1:12:52.040 --> 1:12:53.040]  know what?
[1:12:53.040 --> 1:12:55.640]  I just want you to come in and host the whole show.
[1:12:55.640 --> 1:12:58.080]  And then Mike lives here in Austin does a great job.
[1:12:58.080 --> 1:12:59.440]  He kind of knew some of my business.
[1:12:59.440 --> 1:13:01.600]  He said, don't you have that vaccine report you're about to premiere and don't you have
[1:13:01.600 --> 1:13:03.240]  some things you want to cover?
[1:13:03.240 --> 1:13:05.760]  Why don't you come in and do the first hour and get that done?
[1:13:05.760 --> 1:13:06.760]  I said, I guess you're right.
[1:13:06.760 --> 1:13:09.800]  Because then I went and talked to folks, I go, no, no, remember, you're going to air
[1:13:09.800 --> 1:13:10.800]  this.
[1:13:10.800 --> 1:13:15.120]  So Mike already was watching what we're going to do and knew and so he and so he's going
[1:13:15.120 --> 1:13:16.800]  to be hosting the rest of the broadcast today.
[1:13:16.800 --> 1:13:22.160]  We've got some special stuff in the fourth hour, but the next big false flag is Ebola.
[1:13:22.160 --> 1:13:23.800]  That's one of the things they've got going.
[1:13:23.800 --> 1:13:24.800]  We've got the proof.
[1:13:24.800 --> 1:13:28.040]  He's already in the Caribbean, he's already been here before, they're shipping the folks
[1:13:28.040 --> 1:13:31.080]  in from the countries that have the biggest outbreak ever.
[1:13:31.080 --> 1:13:32.080]  This is really important.
[1:13:32.080 --> 1:13:35.800]  He's going to get into also some big breakthroughs in physics.
[1:13:35.800 --> 1:13:36.880]  So look for that.
[1:13:36.880 --> 1:13:39.480]  Mike Adams is coming in here in just a few minutes.
[1:13:39.480 --> 1:13:46.680]  Now we're behind for 2019 the amount of money we need to even operate.
[1:13:46.680 --> 1:13:52.600]  But if people understand how much we're under attack and you support us, we can expand in
[1:13:52.600 --> 1:13:53.800]  this critical year into the future.
[1:13:53.800 --> 1:13:58.120]  And I think you now realize, I mean, they're trying to plant child porn on us.
[1:13:58.120 --> 1:13:59.440]  They're trying to put me in prison.
[1:13:59.440 --> 1:14:01.800]  I mean, they're really coming after us, but it's okay.
[1:14:01.800 --> 1:14:04.840]  As long as you stand with us, I'm not going to back down ever.
[1:14:04.840 --> 1:14:07.200]  I'm not going to give up.
[1:14:07.200 --> 1:14:09.800]  I'll never give in, but I can give out.
[1:14:09.800 --> 1:14:14.000]  So you have to understand you are the info war and it's beyond loving you.
[1:14:14.000 --> 1:14:16.960]  I mean, I depend on you completely.
[1:14:16.960 --> 1:14:20.400]  You understand that like oxygen that I breathe in.
[1:14:20.400 --> 1:14:22.000]  I mean, you're everything.
[1:14:22.000 --> 1:14:24.600]  That's why it's obscene when you call and tell me how great I am.
[1:14:24.600 --> 1:14:29.080]  Listen, it'd be like a man on a raft in the Atlantic Ocean and freezing water.
[1:14:29.080 --> 1:14:30.600]  And if I fall off, I'm going to die.
[1:14:30.600 --> 1:14:32.760]  And the raft is telling me how great I am.
[1:14:32.760 --> 1:14:35.880]  I'm like, are you kidding me?
[1:14:35.880 --> 1:14:37.080]  We're in this together.
[1:14:37.080 --> 1:14:38.080]  We hang together.
[1:14:38.080 --> 1:14:39.080]  We hang separate.
[1:14:39.080 --> 1:14:40.680]  Like Benjamin Franklin said.
[1:14:40.680 --> 1:14:46.200]  Now look at this article, Dr. McCam shot, please.
[1:14:46.200 --> 1:14:50.200]  Father of Sandy Hook victim wins defamation while suiting in Stalix Jones.
[1:14:50.200 --> 1:14:53.200]  This is from last June.
[1:14:53.200 --> 1:14:54.560]  I never wrote the book.
[1:14:54.560 --> 1:14:55.560]  They didn't want a lawsuit.
[1:14:55.560 --> 1:14:59.280]  That's totally fake news for MarketWatch.
[1:14:59.280 --> 1:15:07.400]  At least this article and all these stories had some truth in that all the little things
[1:15:07.400 --> 1:15:14.280]  this judge has done in Austin add up to $100,000 if we end up losing the suit that we have
[1:15:14.280 --> 1:15:15.280]  to pay down the road.
[1:15:15.280 --> 1:15:17.600]  But so even that is fake news within it.
[1:15:17.600 --> 1:15:19.040]  That's not the story.
[1:15:19.040 --> 1:15:26.520]  The story is that they are obsessed with what we're doing because we're really doing
[1:15:26.520 --> 1:15:27.680]  the research.
[1:15:27.680 --> 1:15:29.720]  That's why they're always saying we're not real.
[1:15:29.720 --> 1:15:31.120]  That's why we're always saying we're fake news.
[1:15:31.120 --> 1:15:33.240]  We're lying.
[1:15:33.240 --> 1:15:36.640]  Last hour we showed you those kids dying in the hospitals when they're giving vaccines.
[1:15:36.640 --> 1:15:37.640]  That's real.
[1:15:37.640 --> 1:15:40.280]  The global is telling you vaccines never hurt anybody.
[1:15:40.280 --> 1:15:41.280]  That's a fraud.
[1:15:41.280 --> 1:15:45.720]  So Mike Adams is coming here and co-hosts this next segment with me that I'm leaving
[1:15:45.720 --> 1:15:49.400]  to go take care of business here in the office with a big plan we're about to launch that
[1:15:49.400 --> 1:15:53.320]  listeners came up with and then I'm going to be back later.
[1:15:53.320 --> 1:15:57.360]  But Mike Adams is coming in right now and he's going to host the whole show.
[1:15:57.360 --> 1:15:59.200]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[1:15:59.200 --> 1:16:03.760]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected
[1:16:03.760 --> 1:16:04.760]  by you.
[1:16:04.760 --> 1:16:06.160]  But the symptoms are there.
[1:16:06.160 --> 1:16:11.040]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are
[1:16:11.040 --> 1:16:14.560]  just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[1:16:14.560 --> 1:16:19.080]  Here how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives
[1:16:19.080 --> 1:16:20.080]  across America.
[1:16:20.080 --> 1:16:22.080]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[1:16:22.080 --> 1:16:24.080]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[1:16:24.080 --> 1:16:27.680]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much
[1:16:27.680 --> 1:16:28.680]  healthier I feel.
[1:16:28.680 --> 1:16:31.320]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.

[1:17:58.440 --> 1:18:02.480]  It was about three and a half months ago and I said on air I'm going to religiously take
[1:18:02.480 --> 1:18:03.480]  my supplements.
[1:18:03.480 --> 1:18:07.600]  I've always taken them in the past but I forget like everybody else to stay on the regimen.
[1:18:07.600 --> 1:18:12.960]  Well I've done it and I've lost 39 pounds in less than four months and my life is so
[1:18:12.960 --> 1:18:17.440]  amazing and I still have cake and ice cream and pie just like I did before.
[1:18:17.440 --> 1:18:23.080]  I'm exercising the same amount but my body has the trace elements and the key things
[1:18:23.080 --> 1:18:28.680]  it needs like the clean iodine and X2 and X3 and I take a good energy booster like turbo
[1:18:28.680 --> 1:18:32.680]  force and brain force for my brain and I take the fish oil and I take the turmeric and I

[1:19:04.720 --> 1:19:09.080]  I gotta talk about one of your products a little bit about me I'm 245 pounds I work
[1:19:09.080 --> 1:19:14.040]  about 10 to 13 hours a day at UPS and make a long story short I used to have a problem
[1:19:14.040 --> 1:19:19.200]  with Adderall I do have ADHD but you know I was taking Adderall for its energy boosting
[1:19:19.200 --> 1:19:22.680]  properties you know I kind of got a little out of hand and you know I listen you religiously
[1:19:22.680 --> 1:19:27.600]  in my truck every day so I tried your turbo force and really it's a cliche this product
[1:19:27.600 --> 1:19:32.040]  changed my life but turbo force really changed my life he was a dad no longer take Adderall
[1:19:32.040 --> 1:19:36.680]  and I get by literally the 13 hours a day I work on a half of a packet of your turbo
[1:19:36.680 --> 1:19:41.520]  force and if you take a half a packet that's literally a dollar a day and you save so much
[1:19:41.520 --> 1:19:45.720]  money versus you know a monster which is what 499 and you know I just had to call and tell
[1:19:45.720 --> 1:19:49.840]  you guys how great turbo force is and if anybody's on the fence they really have to try it.

[1:20:01.080 --> 1:20:22.480]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show Waging War on Corruption it's Alex Jones coming
[1:20:22.480 --> 1:20:32.360]  to you live from the front lines of the Info War we are go well my instincts were right
[1:20:32.360 --> 1:20:42.000]  last night as about 9 30 10 o'clock my phone started just ringing off the hook text messages
[1:20:42.000 --> 1:20:46.920]  people coming up my parents party hugging me saying you know hang in there some people
[1:20:46.920 --> 1:20:50.440]  are Democrats they say they're all voting for Trump they say the Democrats are just
[1:20:50.440 --> 1:20:54.280]  too dangerous now they're just an evil party they're certainly not the party of people
[1:20:54.280 --> 1:20:59.000]  like Martin Luther King or Jimmy Carter for that matter and he had his own problems so
[1:20:59.000 --> 1:21:02.880]  there's a huge awakening the dominoes are following there were folks there from Britain
[1:21:02.880 --> 1:21:05.560]  who were just said oh everybody's awake now everybody's listening to your show over there
[1:21:05.560 --> 1:21:09.560]  it's insane even though the election fraud you know we just threw labor out labor just
[1:21:09.560 --> 1:21:15.080]  lost almost 40% of its voters that's never happened that's a total realignment and but
[1:21:15.080 --> 1:21:19.480]  I was telling people I'm saying this is good that they're attacking me and that it's it's
[1:21:19.480 --> 1:21:25.080]  a story that was 12 days old last night or 11 days old last night that had been in the
[1:21:25.080 --> 1:21:32.920]  local news and then they only waited and pushed it the deep state and operation mockingbird
[1:21:32.920 --> 1:21:38.040]  on every channel so that people saw in the new year Alex Jones is a failure Alex Jones
[1:21:38.040 --> 1:21:43.080]  is a loser Alex Jones had a judge order him $100,000 which is a whole other story it's
[1:21:43.080 --> 1:21:48.520]  a year of this judge doing stuff like this with different 30,000 here 40,000 there 60,000
[1:21:48.520 --> 1:21:55.560]  here it's actually over 100,000 and it's like Rob do they're like they're deposing them
[1:21:55.560 --> 1:22:00.680]  and they go what is your source of this video he goes it's seeing it from the Sandy Hook
[1:22:00.680 --> 1:22:03.320]  lawsuit and they go but but who sent it to you he goes it's seven years ago we don't
[1:22:03.320 --> 1:22:09.160]  know and there's a statute of limitations we're doing the the anti slap thing where
[1:22:09.160 --> 1:22:14.920]  where they're not even supposed to get any discovery there there isn't discovery but
[1:22:14.920 --> 1:22:20.600]  it's the same thing I mean they treat us like we're Al Capone folks and they literally believe
[1:22:20.600 --> 1:22:25.800]  the media the judges and people when they tell them that I'm an actor and that I don't believe
[1:22:25.800 --> 1:22:29.640]  any of this and I've done all these horrible things but they've never seen me say that they
[1:22:29.640 --> 1:22:34.520]  just are told that I'm this monster because they watch shows like Homeland so I've learned also
[1:22:34.520 --> 1:22:40.840]  how childlike the politicos are and they even we've confirmed now I'm gonna leave it at that
[1:22:40.840 --> 1:22:45.240]  it's gonna be coming out soon we have witnesses and affidavits they talk about it at parties in
[1:22:45.240 --> 1:22:49.720]  front of people how they're gonna get me and everything I mean this is this is law enforcement
[1:22:49.720 --> 1:22:55.400]  getting involved so so why do you think the supreme court has taken this up in Connecticut
[1:22:55.400 --> 1:23:01.880]  when they tried to frame us with child porn I mean the left has taken all normal chivalry
[1:23:01.880 --> 1:23:08.440]  and rules and just thrown them overboard with trump derangement syndrome and and and and
[1:23:08.440 --> 1:23:14.520]  and is desperate because the dominos are already falling and so they think if they destroy me
[1:23:15.320 --> 1:23:19.400]  that that's gonna send a message everybody that you better sit down and shut up that's not how
[1:23:19.400 --> 1:23:25.160]  Americans are and I go back to this I've said it a thousand times we've been asleep for decades
[1:23:25.160 --> 1:23:29.720]  and the globalists thought they're intimidation because their thugs is what did it but now that
[1:23:29.720 --> 1:23:33.960]  they called everyone racist that loves America or everyone racist that loves England or everyone
[1:23:33.960 --> 1:23:37.800]  racist that loves their family or everyone that loves Christmas or everyone that loves health or
[1:23:37.800 --> 1:23:42.520]  everyone people following it well I'm not a bad person you're the bad person so their bullying
[1:23:42.520 --> 1:23:47.880]  has now backfired so they're still acting like we're asleep pressing and bullying but we're
[1:23:47.880 --> 1:23:53.640]  awake so the bullying only enrages us well and the same people that that are calling you this
[1:23:53.640 --> 1:23:58.200]  bad person they said that half of America are deplorables and those Americans say well gosh
[1:23:58.200 --> 1:24:03.400]  I'm not a deplorable I'm an honest compassionate person I care about the future of our country
[1:24:03.400 --> 1:24:07.080]  the media is lying and so they know they're lying about you too and by the way
[1:24:07.080 --> 1:24:13.000]  what is wrong with questioning official narratives doesn't mean that that you're defaming anybody
[1:24:13.000 --> 1:24:16.920]  to to question official narratives on all kinds of things I mean if there's a defamation lawsuit
[1:24:16.920 --> 1:24:22.040]  to be had in this country Trump should sue the New York Times Washington Post CNN
[1:24:22.040 --> 1:24:26.120]  knowingly saying he's a russian and he isn't constantly lying about him and you were standing
[1:24:26.120 --> 1:24:29.480]  in the break I said when is Trump gonna take action on the racketeering it's beyond censorship
[1:24:30.040 --> 1:24:34.760]  this coordinated attack on people that are pro america you said well he's got to get vindicated
[1:24:34.760 --> 1:24:38.520]  by the senate that he will well that's why they go russia gate now ukraine they're just going to
[1:24:38.520 --> 1:24:42.920]  launch more that's why they say they have more articles they're never going to stop stop going
[1:24:42.920 --> 1:24:48.200]  on the attack because it changes the subject from their criminality yeah you're right my point was
[1:24:48.200 --> 1:24:53.880]  that trump cannot right now go after big tech because he'll be accused of obstructing the senate
[1:24:53.880 --> 1:24:58.840]  trial so I think once the senate vindicates him which should happen fairly quickly if
[1:24:58.840 --> 1:25:03.240]  Nancy Pelosi ever releases the articles of impeachment which by the way that's her obstructing
[1:25:03.240 --> 1:25:06.920]  justice by the way holding on to those articles but Trump will have an opportunity to go after
[1:25:06.920 --> 1:25:12.200]  big tech and say look you cannot censor people's speech just based on their political views
[1:25:12.200 --> 1:25:16.360]  this has got to change in america or we don't have a republic left and you notice it started
[1:25:16.360 --> 1:25:22.520]  this week or last week massive censorship of Trump's twitter and then them denying it when
[1:25:22.520 --> 1:25:27.160]  they're doing it bigger than Dallas shadow banning yeah they they are but they're phantom
[1:25:27.160 --> 1:25:32.920]  zoning his tweets yeah yeah they're they're shadow banning like crazy even all his supporting
[1:25:32.920 --> 1:25:37.800]  accounts but the thing is all his supporters the thing is independent media that has survived
[1:25:37.800 --> 1:25:44.360]  this now is doing better in 2019 had they just had a better year than in any year previously
[1:25:44.360 --> 1:25:49.160]  and I've talked to many leaders in independent media now some were wiped out by the censorship
[1:25:49.160 --> 1:25:54.280]  they didn't survive but those that are still here like us for example we had record revenues
[1:25:54.280 --> 1:25:58.520]  last year even despite complete censorship and complete the platform I know you had a couple
[1:25:58.520 --> 1:26:03.720]  of great months too other leaders have been having great years because the the customers and the
[1:26:03.720 --> 1:26:08.120]  users are supporting us well that's absolutely right you know the things they did the direct
[1:26:08.120 --> 1:26:13.880]  espionage I mean that's what it is the infiltration the taking immersion accounts that the banning
[1:26:13.880 --> 1:26:18.040]  our advertising ability on the internet to advertise products right you know we were funding
[1:26:18.040 --> 1:26:23.400]  about a third of what we did outside the audience you're doing advertising for products that that's
[1:26:23.400 --> 1:26:31.880]  been taken away from us so that's why that we've had you know one of the worst years that we've
[1:26:31.880 --> 1:26:35.160]  you know had in the last six seven years but but that's okay because I had some reserves
[1:26:35.160 --> 1:26:39.000]  we're going through those but yes I know talking to Gateway Pundit and many others they've had
[1:26:39.000 --> 1:26:45.080]  their best years because so many other people got shut down folks now have rallied towards what's
[1:26:45.080 --> 1:26:49.400]  left and all of us are working harder so that's why it's critical for listeners I want to thank
[1:26:49.400 --> 1:26:54.040]  you I talk about how they put us on every channel say we're losers say they're going to shut us down
[1:26:54.040 --> 1:27:00.600]  and just massive support comes in that's a good thing but that only helps us you know take back
[1:27:01.160 --> 1:27:04.760]  part of one of the months that was under what we needed so thank you all for the support but
[1:27:04.760 --> 1:27:09.640]  whatever you do it's a golden opportunity to say why do you think Alex Jones is so demonized and
[1:27:09.640 --> 1:27:14.200]  lied about because it's bigger than Alex Jones it's the platform where you hear what Mike Adams
[1:27:14.200 --> 1:27:18.680]  really has to say or you hear what Dr. Steve Pachennick has to say or you hear what all these
[1:27:18.680 --> 1:27:24.840]  other amazing guests and these amazing callers we had a caller call in yesterday and he said you
[1:27:24.840 --> 1:27:29.480]  ought to put tape over your mouths at Trump rallies and say save the First Amendment stop
[1:27:29.480 --> 1:27:34.280]  censorship or info wars and then when people ask you can pull it off and talk to them well
[1:27:34.920 --> 1:27:38.120]  I was here last night this morning we're going to come out we're going to print
[1:27:39.480 --> 1:27:42.520]  hundreds of thousands of stickers up front put them in all the packages
[1:27:43.080 --> 1:27:47.720]  sell them at cost and we're going to hand them out at Trump rallies to make that a message inside
[1:27:47.720 --> 1:27:52.200]  as well and it's going to be extremely extremely powerful so we're moving on many fronts that
[1:27:52.200 --> 1:27:56.440]  was Alistair's idea but this is one of the last days we're going to have this end of year now
[1:27:56.440 --> 1:28:00.440]  start of the year special up to 75 percent off straw out for your shipping double-pagery points
[1:28:00.440 --> 1:28:03.880]  to sell out of the inventory so we have to pay the inventory tax on it we've got to do that only a
[1:28:03.880 --> 1:28:09.480]  few more days in the inventory and so now is the time biggest sales ever in FullWarsTour.com
[1:28:09.480 --> 1:28:13.880]  because yes we're bringing in a ton of money you know four hundred thousand dollars yesterday about
[1:28:13.880 --> 1:28:18.520]  300 000 extra than we normally would but you're showing looking probably 150 000 dollars there
[1:28:18.520 --> 1:28:22.280]  in one day it sounds like a lot but that's one of the biggest days of the year is the last day
[1:28:22.280 --> 1:28:25.960]  we need that to fight into the future I know we're going to break shortly but I also want to mention
[1:28:25.960 --> 1:28:30.680]  the reason they hate you Alex is because you are proving the entrepreneurial model of free market
[1:28:30.680 --> 1:28:35.720]  economics you're showing that when customers choose your products and your superior formulations
[1:28:35.720 --> 1:28:39.960]  and your better values than what anybody can find in the health food whole foods out there
[1:28:39.960 --> 1:28:44.760]  the media hates the fact that you are succeeding in that model we're breaking their monopoly
[1:28:44.760 --> 1:28:49.400]  everything about what natural news.com does everything when in FullWars.com does is absolutely
[1:28:49.400 --> 1:28:53.560]  the Americana model they can't stand it Mike Adams is about to take over please spread the word you

[1:32:05.160 --> 1:32:12.360]  long that i take it for granted now when we break some massive story that changes the whole world
[1:32:12.360 --> 1:32:17.560]  and that really does great things for the future of not just our children but our children's children
[1:32:18.120 --> 1:32:23.160]  info wars really has changed history and that's why i need to pull back and ask the listeners

[1:34:18.360 --> 1:34:26.120]  of you and i suggest you use it well said words of alex jones there this is the alex jones show
[1:34:26.120 --> 1:34:30.840]  mike adams filling in here for the rest of the show today and a little bit into the fourth hour
[1:34:30.840 --> 1:34:35.880]  as well thank you for joining me the first day here of 2020 a year that i believe will be the
[1:34:35.880 --> 1:34:42.840]  most memorable in our lifetimes the the things that are about to happen this year i'll cover some
[1:34:42.840 --> 1:34:48.680]  of them today but trust me you're gonna look back at this and say whoa how did we get through that
[1:34:48.680 --> 1:34:53.640]  and i can't believe how much change it's going to be really extraordinary at levels that you
[1:34:53.640 --> 1:34:58.600]  probably can't even imagine right now i'm going to cover some breaking news today get into some
[1:34:58.600 --> 1:35:07.080]  analysis there is an ebola false flag operation being engineered i believe to infect americans
[1:35:07.080 --> 1:35:14.760]  with ebola in order to push an ebola scare and the new ebola vaccine that has just been approved by
[1:35:14.760 --> 1:35:21.960]  the fda and a new ebola testing system that's been rolled out by the cdc that causes false
[1:35:21.960 --> 1:35:28.280]  positives so that they can quarantine you and take you away throw you in a room with other
[1:35:28.280 --> 1:35:33.480]  actually sick people and they can shut down entire cities and communities and create an ebola scare
[1:35:33.480 --> 1:35:39.240]  so i will be talking about that but trust me i mean mark my words again this is this is january
[1:35:39.240 --> 1:35:45.560]  one sometime this year there's going to be an ebola outbreak most likely in the united states
[1:35:45.560 --> 1:35:52.200]  but first let me get to some other interesting news first a kind of a funny item and i i posted
[1:35:52.200 --> 1:35:57.560]  this this morning on on my website there's a company this is really funny this this is the
[1:35:57.560 --> 1:36:04.040]  problem with um thinking that everything can be digital so there's a company called ammo squared
[1:36:04.040 --> 1:36:10.280]  i believe that is launching a crowdfunding effort to launch a digital ammunition exchange
[1:36:10.280 --> 1:36:18.840]  exchange where you can buy digital ammo and not actually have it and so you can own a 300 win mag
[1:36:18.840 --> 1:36:26.120]  and 762 by 51 and you can own 556 ammo digitally and then you can trade it digitally and they say
[1:36:26.120 --> 1:36:31.320]  you can take delivery when you want it but isn't ammo something that you need when the grid goes
[1:36:31.320 --> 1:36:36.360]  down when there's a collapse that's you know preparedness isn't that don't you need ammo
[1:36:36.360 --> 1:36:42.520]  like physically in your gun or in your house in storage so this idea that you can have digital
[1:36:42.520 --> 1:36:49.320]  ammo now this is the absurdity of the the the cryptocurrency idea which makes sense in the
[1:36:49.320 --> 1:36:56.120]  world of crypto you know digital money actually does make sense but digital ammo are you serious
[1:36:57.080 --> 1:37:03.560]  do you think this is a video game where you buy guns and and ammo in the game no this is the real
[1:37:03.560 --> 1:37:09.240]  world and you know as steve quayl says if you can't touch it you don't own it so i am on the record
[1:37:09.240 --> 1:37:13.240]  this is my personal opinion not infowars opinion but i am on the record saying i think this is
[1:37:13.240 --> 1:37:19.480]  the dumbest idea in the history of preparedness to purchase digital ammunition i think it's a
[1:37:19.480 --> 1:37:27.160]  horrible idea and um if you want to buy digital goods then gosh why wouldn't infowars sell a
[1:37:27.160 --> 1:37:32.760]  digital stored food yeah you here you can buy digital stored food i should call alex and say
[1:37:32.760 --> 1:37:39.240]  alex i got a great idea for you why don't you have digital preparedness items that you don't ship
[1:37:39.240 --> 1:37:44.040]  to people but they own them you know that would be that would be called a scam if alex did something
[1:37:44.040 --> 1:37:50.200]  like that but somehow selling digital ammunition i look it's it's hilarious i i wish the company
[1:37:50.200 --> 1:37:54.520]  well but i think it's a horrible idea that's my personal opinion but it just goes to show you
[1:37:54.520 --> 1:38:00.600]  that not everything should be digital folks you need a real firearm you need you need a real
[1:38:00.600 --> 1:38:05.160]  ar-15 you need real ammunition obviously you need a real water filter you know you need
[1:38:05.160 --> 1:38:08.920]  these things in the real world otherwise how are you going to function it's like oh the grid goes
[1:38:08.920 --> 1:38:16.200]  down well good thing i've got 5 000 rounds of digital ammunition out there somewhere in a digital world
[1:38:17.000 --> 1:38:22.120]  not going to help you folks not going to help you so that's a funny item now this not so funny
[1:38:22.120 --> 1:38:27.800]  item but something that it's a couple weeks old but it's worth mentioning the wall street journal
[1:38:27.800 --> 1:38:34.920]  did an investigation of amazon and found that amazon was actually selling literal dumpster trash
[1:38:35.720 --> 1:38:43.240]  on their website as new items new food new supplements like jars of olives and so on
[1:38:43.960 --> 1:38:49.800]  the wall street journal sent out reporters to go dumpster diving behind trader joes and they found
[1:38:49.800 --> 1:38:54.840]  trash that trader joes had thrown away and they just kind of cleaned it up they sent it off to amazon
[1:38:54.840 --> 1:38:59.800]  opened up a new account on amazon.com and they were able to list it and they were able to purchase
[1:38:59.800 --> 1:39:07.160]  this dumpster trash on amazon when you purchase items from amazon.com you may be purchasing
[1:39:07.160 --> 1:39:15.160]  moldy items expired items counterfeit items and actual literal dumpster trash as the wall street
[1:39:15.160 --> 1:39:21.480]  journal investigation found out and the reason i mentioned this is because if you're buying nutritional
[1:39:21.480 --> 1:39:29.960]  items or superfoods supplements you buy from info wars store.com it's all new there is no dumpster
[1:39:29.960 --> 1:39:36.040]  trash sold in the store you want dumpster trash you got to go to amazon you want real fresh brand
[1:39:36.040 --> 1:39:42.440]  new items obviously quality controlled safety tested professionally handled info wars store.com
[1:39:43.000 --> 1:39:48.680]  and basically practically any other retailer online doesn't sell trash but amazon does
[1:39:48.680 --> 1:39:55.320]  so if you if you want to if you want to trade dollars for trash you can buy from amazon or
[1:39:55.320 --> 1:40:00.280]  if you want to trade dollars for digital bullets you can go to the online digital ammunition store
[1:40:00.280 --> 1:40:06.040]  that's launching soon i mean these are these are horrible ideas people i mean look the the theme
[1:40:06.600 --> 1:40:14.600]  of my day here today with you is i want to help all of us in 2020 think clearly i want all of us to
[1:40:14.600 --> 1:40:21.080]  navigate this chaotic world in a way that helps us explore and defend freedom and liberty
[1:40:21.880 --> 1:40:25.480]  i want us to be healthy i want you to be healthy i want your brain to work well
[1:40:26.040 --> 1:40:32.520]  i want us to be able to defeat irrationality and defeat tyranny and the attacks on liberty
[1:40:32.520 --> 1:40:37.640]  that are becoming more frequent in order to do that we have to think clearly about everything
[1:40:38.200 --> 1:40:43.720]  we have to be able to distinguish between bad ideas and good ideas it's a bad idea to buy digital
[1:40:43.720 --> 1:40:49.960]  ammunition and think you own the ammo it's a bad idea to buy anything from amazon.com that's food
[1:40:49.960 --> 1:40:56.120]  or supplements or superfood because it might be dumpster trash it's a bad idea to elect elizabeth
[1:40:56.120 --> 1:41:03.960]  warren as president she's got all kinds of ideas they're all bad ideas they're almost as bad as aoc's
[1:41:03.960 --> 1:41:07.720]  ideas like oh let's ban the combustion engine and then we can all starve to death when the farms
[1:41:07.720 --> 1:41:13.480]  collapse that's a bad idea unless you just love venezuela and how socialism works there and dumps
[1:41:13.480 --> 1:41:18.600]  are diving you know come to think of it why doesn't amazon open a whole retail shop in venezuela
[1:41:18.600 --> 1:41:24.520]  like dumpster diving food because those people have had to become experts in that arena sadly
[1:41:24.520 --> 1:41:28.120]  because that's what socialism does to your country collapses it to the point where you
[1:41:28.120 --> 1:41:33.560]  have to dumpster dive for food again the amazon.com business model at this point it's it's shameful
[1:41:34.440 --> 1:41:38.680]  but i want you to think clearly about everything and that's why today i'm going to cover some
[1:41:38.680 --> 1:41:42.440]  mysteries of the universe as alex hinted in the opening of the show i'm going to cover a little
[1:41:42.440 --> 1:41:48.120]  bit of flat earth theory and why i disagree with flat earth theory i'm going to cover the mystery
[1:41:48.120 --> 1:41:53.320]  of the disappearing stars in the cosmos a little bit of physics for you here a little bit of science
[1:41:53.320 --> 1:42:00.280]  today but the reason i'm covering that is because i want you to be able to think clearly about the
[1:42:00.280 --> 1:42:06.280]  world in which you live the cosmos in which we all exist because i think 2020 can be a year
[1:42:06.280 --> 1:42:12.600]  that's great for all of us who do pursue the truth all of us who are pro-liberty all of us who
[1:42:13.240 --> 1:42:20.040]  have been really fighting for free speech and in some cases fighting for president trump for
[1:42:20.040 --> 1:42:26.040]  example or fighting to defeat the deep state fighting to expose the deep state i think 2020
[1:42:26.040 --> 1:42:33.320]  can be a great year for us but only if we think clearly only if we manage to avoid distortions

[1:47:06.680 --> 1:47:25.480]  all right we're back on the alex jones show the first day of the new year it's going to be a great
[1:47:25.480 --> 1:47:29.640]  year for liberty because the truth is coming out i mean even though we're all under attack and even
[1:47:29.640 --> 1:47:35.560]  though there's censorship and even though there's defamation and smearing of the pioneers of liberty
[1:47:35.560 --> 1:47:39.000]  i think it's going to be a great year for all of us because i mean think about this
[1:47:39.000 --> 1:47:44.600]  we have forced the deep state to show its cards we've forced the radical left to take the mask
[1:47:44.600 --> 1:47:50.040]  off and show the radicalism i mean this is 2019 was a year that the left stood up and
[1:47:50.040 --> 1:47:56.040]  applauded and celebrated the mass murder of living human babies as they passed that law in new york
[1:47:56.040 --> 1:48:01.880]  i mean they're just cheering in fancy side you know in previous years that mask hadn't come off yet
[1:48:01.880 --> 1:48:08.600]  and 2019 was also the year that the mask came off about gun control now through uh beto and and
[1:48:08.600 --> 1:48:12.520]  governor northam and others are they're just saying yeah we're going to come take your guns
[1:48:13.320 --> 1:48:18.680]  we're going to unleash the national guard perhaps in virginia and we're going to come take your guns
[1:48:18.680 --> 1:48:24.120]  at gunpoint you know before they wouldn't talk about that now it's all out in the open that's a
[1:48:24.120 --> 1:48:30.120]  victory to know what they really intend to do because democrats are liars the only way they
[1:48:30.120 --> 1:48:35.880]  ever gain political office is about lying about their intentions i mean they they claim to be
[1:48:35.880 --> 1:48:39.640]  kind of conservative when they're running for office they claim no we're going to respect your
[1:48:39.640 --> 1:48:45.240]  your second amendment rights no we're going to respect the life of children because we love little
[1:48:45.240 --> 1:48:50.680]  kids especially joe biden he loves them in a weird twisted pervert kind of way but now the
[1:48:50.680 --> 1:48:56.440]  masks has come off now we know they want to kill their own children they want to take your guns
[1:48:56.440 --> 1:49:00.120]  and probably kill you i mean if if they're willing to kill their own kids you think they're
[1:49:00.120 --> 1:49:04.120]  going to hesitate to kill you you know shoot you in the head and throw you in a ditch no they're not
[1:49:04.120 --> 1:49:07.640]  going to they're not going to hesitate at all that's what they want in fact some of them openly
[1:49:07.640 --> 1:49:11.400]  talk about that heck michael more was out there there's like white people are dangerous white
[1:49:11.400 --> 1:49:16.920]  people are bad like dude you're a white guy have you looked in the mirror recently you're you're
[1:49:16.920 --> 1:49:22.440]  kind of white what are you talking about yourself what he's like when white people walk down the
[1:49:22.440 --> 1:49:28.600]  street you should run to the other side of the street like really really what should people do
[1:49:28.600 --> 1:49:34.360]  when they encounter you michael more should they flee as well because it's just these people are
[1:49:34.360 --> 1:49:40.840]  insane but it's all coming out so that's a victory in a way it's it's it's fascinating and also the
[1:49:40.840 --> 1:49:45.960]  racism is coming out people like michael more is just he's a bigot he's an anti-white bigot
[1:49:46.680 --> 1:49:51.240]  and people who are paying attention realize oh it's conservatives that are tolerant it's
[1:49:51.240 --> 1:49:57.320]  conservatives are like yeah we welcome african-americans to conservative points of view we we welcome
[1:49:58.440 --> 1:50:03.320]  asian people who are being discriminated against by the liberal universities on the east coast and
[1:50:03.320 --> 1:50:08.920]  the west coast did you know if you're asian that you there's racism against you for being asian
[1:50:09.480 --> 1:50:14.520]  there's a penalty for being asian did you know that just to get into a university like like
[1:50:14.520 --> 1:50:20.520]  harvard and get into ucla for being asian you are penalized and so a lot of asian people
[1:50:20.520 --> 1:50:27.800]  waking up was like hey these leftists are bigots they're racist and this is unfair you know like
[1:50:27.800 --> 1:50:32.840]  hey we did great on the tests why can't we get into the university because you're asian in fact
[1:50:32.840 --> 1:50:37.320]  that there was a court ruling recently i forgot exactly which which state it was in that ruled
[1:50:37.320 --> 1:50:41.720]  that universities can discriminate against asians because discrimination is part of the leftist
[1:50:42.920 --> 1:50:49.240]  ethos this is their world they love discrimination and they hate white people and they hate asians
[1:50:49.240 --> 1:50:54.120]  and believe me sooner or later they'll get around to hating black people too because they hate
[1:50:54.120 --> 1:50:59.640]  everyone they hate themselves that's why they're suicidal it's it's incredible so 2020 is going
[1:50:59.640 --> 1:51:05.800]  to be a very interesting year let me cover oh before i get to that by the way i recently
[1:51:05.800 --> 1:51:10.360]  placed an order with infowars store i haven't received it yet but i i want to check out the
[1:51:10.360 --> 1:51:15.160]  new toothpaste they've been talking about because i know alex's dad formulated that toothpaste and
[1:51:15.160 --> 1:51:20.440]  as a formulator myself toothpaste is one of the most difficult things to formulate in fact we
[1:51:20.440 --> 1:51:24.840]  we don't even have a toothpaste product ourselves so i ordered the infowars store toothpaste there's
[1:51:24.840 --> 1:51:29.720]  two different ones now and they had there was a special for two of them i think there's like a
[1:51:29.720 --> 1:51:34.280]  what's it called the super blue fluoride free and then there's a super silver whitening toothpaste so
[1:51:34.280 --> 1:51:39.480]  i ordered both of them got them on sale got an email yeah shipments come in your way i can't wait
[1:51:39.480 --> 1:51:45.880]  to check those out and yeah i'm a customer too because i understand the quality of the ingredients
[1:51:45.880 --> 1:51:50.520]  that are in the formulations i understand what it takes behind the scenes to make this happen right
[1:51:50.520 --> 1:51:55.880]  now it's 50 off those toothpaste i think just for i don't know another day or two it's going to end
[1:51:55.880 --> 1:52:02.360]  soon some items are up to like 60 off for for knockout and so on i don't know maybe i shouldn't
[1:52:02.360 --> 1:52:08.760]  say this publicly but behind the scenes i would say to alex how are you offering these discounts
[1:52:08.760 --> 1:52:15.400]  because that like you're not making any money on some of these for sure i know because i know the
[1:52:15.400 --> 1:52:21.320]  margins in this industry how how are you doing that and i know he said maybe in coming in 2020
[1:52:21.320 --> 1:52:26.440]  he can only do maximum like 40 discount so right now these are the best discounts you're probably
[1:52:26.440 --> 1:52:33.320]  ever going to see ever from infowars at all an infowars store that's it because you can't discount
[1:52:33.320 --> 1:52:37.960]  60 percent or 70 percent you can't do it because you're just draining money out the door when you
[1:52:37.960 --> 1:52:41.720]  do that but hey it's a good deal for you if you take advantage of these and i took advantage of it
[1:52:41.720 --> 1:52:48.920]  myself all right uh moving on to i got an article i i published yesterday i just want to cover
[1:52:48.920 --> 1:52:54.040]  highlights on this and then we'll get into some more interesting things uh the article is called
[1:52:54.040 --> 1:52:59.240]  ten insane completely irrational things that millions of americans believe as we enter the
[1:52:59.240 --> 1:53:03.240]  year 2020 i'm not going to go through every point or read you from the article this is just
[1:53:03.240 --> 1:53:08.600]  just kind of an inspiration here of what i wanted to cover but the point is you live in a society
[1:53:09.160 --> 1:53:16.360]  where you are surrounded by people who are insane at some level for example leftists believe that a
[1:53:16.360 --> 1:53:22.920]  man can become a woman that's insane that's a form of mental illness it is mass mental illness when a
[1:53:22.920 --> 1:53:27.000]  large number of people believe it doesn't make it more true just because a huge number of people
[1:53:27.000 --> 1:53:31.240]  believe something that's false that doesn't make it true it just means that the mental illness is
[1:53:31.240 --> 1:53:37.320]  spreading to a larger number of people who now share in that mental illness guess what sperm donors
[1:53:37.320 --> 1:53:41.960]  are always male so you've seen that story recently i think paul joseph watson talked about this
[1:53:42.600 --> 1:53:47.160]  in a good video about people going insane in 2019 it's funny i was writing this story
[1:53:47.720 --> 1:53:51.880]  before i saw that video i think it came out about the same time but we were having the same ideas
[1:53:52.680 --> 1:53:57.080]  there was uh i don't know some couple i forget what it is some transgender couple couple that
[1:53:57.080 --> 1:54:02.760]  had a baby because they had a female uh sperm donor the article said well guess what there's
[1:54:02.760 --> 1:54:08.280]  no such thing as a female sperm donor because producing sperm is part of the definition of being
[1:54:08.280 --> 1:54:14.360]  male of course but cnn and these other left wing news organizations they're trying to of course
[1:54:14.360 --> 1:54:18.040]  confuse children and and confuse people on this issue to say oh men can get pregnant men can
[1:54:18.040 --> 1:54:24.120]  have babies and and women can be sperm donors not really no not in this universe i don't know what
[1:54:24.120 --> 1:54:28.520]  world you're living in little comic book reality that you've invented for yourselves all you mentally
[1:54:28.520 --> 1:54:34.440]  ill leftists your gender confused lunatics but that's not the real world folks and i want you to
[1:54:34.440 --> 1:54:39.080]  live in the real world but you got to understand in this world you are surrounded by people who
[1:54:39.080 --> 1:54:45.480]  believe totally crazy things like from my article belief number two is that the stock market will
[1:54:45.480 --> 1:54:50.440]  never crash again they'll never be a correction that we can remain overbought overbought overbought
[1:54:50.440 --> 1:54:56.040]  forever and just keep over buying more and more that's irrational and that that there's a lot
[1:54:56.040 --> 1:55:00.360]  of conservatives who believe that too that the stock market can just go up forever and that
[1:55:00.360 --> 1:55:06.040]  all the crashes of human history will never repeat themselves somehow we've got that licked
[1:55:06.040 --> 1:55:12.280]  from the federal reserve that our fiat currency our fake dollar will survive forever they think
[1:55:12.280 --> 1:55:19.000]  no it won't in fact it's about ended its run most fiat currencies only survive i don't know
[1:55:19.000 --> 1:55:24.040]  100 years 200 years maybe 250 i don't i can't even think of one that's been
[1:55:25.640 --> 1:55:29.880]  more than a few centuries except maybe the british pound that's probably the longest lasting
[1:55:29.880 --> 1:55:34.280]  currency in history and it has been eclipsed by the euro in many ways although that might
[1:55:34.280 --> 1:55:38.840]  change with brexit but think about it a lot of people have irrational beliefs about lots of things
[1:55:38.840 --> 1:55:44.120]  in my article i also mentioned you know flatter theory that's something that a lot of people who
[1:55:44.120 --> 1:55:51.800]  are conspiracy analysts they are intrigued by flatter theory they think it's true but i'm here
[1:55:51.800 --> 1:55:56.120]  to tell you it's it's not true and i'll i'll help explain that and you're welcome to disagree with me
[1:55:56.120 --> 1:56:01.000]  but you have to argue your points from a point of view of reason and logic consistent with the laws
[1:56:01.000 --> 1:56:07.000]  of physics so you know that's a belief that that is spreading right now and it's it's irrational
[1:56:07.000 --> 1:56:11.560]  although i gotta say the flatter earth people they're not dangerous i mean they're they're it's a
[1:56:11.560 --> 1:56:15.160]  it's a it's a thought experiment and they kind of have fun with it you know they're interesting
[1:56:15.160 --> 1:56:18.440]  people they're curious about the way the world works they're not dangerous like the transgender
[1:56:18.440 --> 1:56:23.880]  people who want to literally take your children and maim their genitalia you know and and hit them
[1:56:23.880 --> 1:56:29.400]  with puberty blocking chemicals and pharmaceuticals like that's dangerous the transgenderism is
[1:56:30.040 --> 1:56:34.920]  child abuse whereas flatter theory it's people who are kind of curious and maybe a little
[1:56:35.480 --> 1:56:39.960]  a little misled about how things work but they're not dangerous not coming up to you putting a gun
[1:56:39.960 --> 1:56:43.160]  your head saying oh you have to believe the earth is flatter i'm going to blow you away
[1:56:43.160 --> 1:56:49.000]  they're not doing that so it's more of it's more of a curiosity actually um leftists believe that
[1:56:49.000 --> 1:56:54.120]  the earth will be destroyed in 10 years if we don't stop burning fossil fuels that's insane
[1:56:54.120 --> 1:57:01.880]  and that's that's a belief that's out there by aoc and others that's insane she aoc in my personal
[1:57:01.880 --> 1:57:09.080]  viewpoint is the first cognitively clinically retarded person to ever be elected to the house
[1:57:09.080 --> 1:57:15.240]  of representatives she is stupid her ideas are bad they're they're horrific they would lead to a
[1:57:15.240 --> 1:57:19.960]  mass starvation the collapse of the food supply for humanity if we stopped farming with diesel
[1:57:19.960 --> 1:57:27.320]  engines and diesel tractors or so on her ideas are bad and if we adopt them we are stupid to
[1:57:27.320 --> 1:57:32.680]  follow those ideas uh thank goodness that those of you who are watching today would never follow
[1:57:32.680 --> 1:57:38.280]  aoc's ideas but we'll be back with more here on the alex jones show continuing into the third
[1:57:38.280 --> 1:57:44.680]  hour stay with us this is mike adams filling in be right back

[2:00:11.720 --> 2:00:16.760]  ahead of us it's my personal belief that this will be one of the most chaotic but also one of the
[2:00:16.760 --> 2:00:23.480]  most life changing years of our lifetimes you'll look back on this in astonishment and i've made

[2:00:34.600 --> 2:00:45.640]  before this is a live broadcast so i'd like you to call in the numbers 877-789 alex that's 877-789-2539
[2:00:45.640 --> 2:00:51.560]  call in we'll load up the board talk to you in the next segment or two about your predictions of
[2:00:51.560 --> 2:00:56.680]  what's going to happen in 2020 so keep it on topic if you would please let's let's talk about what we
[2:00:56.680 --> 2:01:02.840]  think is coming and it's okay if you you disagree with my assessment or you agree with it or you
[2:01:02.840 --> 2:01:07.080]  have something completely different but what do you think is coming what's going to happen with
[2:01:07.080 --> 2:01:11.800]  the election what's going to happen with the senate trial if there ever is one what's going to happen
[2:01:11.800 --> 2:01:18.840]  with the Durham report will there be indictments against dozens of deep staters or hundreds or
[2:01:18.840 --> 2:01:24.760]  thousands of deep staters will there be martial law either locally in places like Virginia or
[2:01:24.760 --> 2:01:31.320]  on a national level will we be involved in a war with Iran you know what's going to happen with the
[2:01:31.320 --> 2:01:36.600]  stock market in 2020 the Fed is all in with Trump right now and creating liquidity but of course the
[2:01:36.600 --> 2:01:41.560]  anti-trump forces are trying to crash the market so call in and tell us what you think is coming
[2:01:41.560 --> 2:01:49.560]  in 2020 i'm looking forward to talking with you and again the numbers 877-789-2539 and we'll get
[2:01:49.560 --> 2:01:55.160]  to your topics now one of the things that i think is coming is an ebola false flag operation
[2:01:55.160 --> 2:02:02.920]  and the reason i think this is because well we we know how the cdc and the fda work the cdc
[2:02:03.560 --> 2:02:09.800]  is it's kind of like a criminal deep state cartel i call it the vaccine deep state cdc is a criminal
[2:02:09.800 --> 2:02:17.320]  organization i mean they former researchers who were funded by the cdc literally fled the country
[2:02:17.960 --> 2:02:23.880]  with millions of dollars in money and are living as fugitives overseas to escape us justice one one
[2:02:23.880 --> 2:02:31.080]  guy out there named poll thorson th or s e and i believe it is is actually a fugitive from justice
[2:02:31.080 --> 2:02:36.680]  took cdc money published a bunch of uh science papers that said that thimeris all was perfectly
[2:02:36.680 --> 2:02:42.280]  safe and then absconded with millions of dollars in taxpayer money yep that's the cdc for you
[2:02:42.920 --> 2:02:49.160]  well they are tag teaming now to create a narrative where they can release ebola
[2:02:49.160 --> 2:02:55.080]  or create conditions for the release of ebola in america such as bringing in ebola infected
[2:02:55.080 --> 2:02:59.400]  migrants from ebola infected countries and this has happened already they're in austin texas right
[2:02:59.400 --> 2:03:04.360]  now info wars has covered that for months actually over shoyer did live interviews with some of the
[2:03:04.360 --> 2:03:08.840]  some of the people there some of the so-called experts who said oh they can't be ebola
[2:03:09.560 --> 2:03:16.120]  really do your tests always work what about incubation time you factored all these things in
[2:03:16.120 --> 2:03:22.680]  of course they haven't but the cdc is announcing well they have a new test that can detect ebola in
[2:03:22.680 --> 2:03:27.480]  the field i don't know there's a couple minutes like like these cop drug tests that they use that
[2:03:27.480 --> 2:03:32.760]  are totally fake you know where they can take any substance and put it in their little bag
[2:03:32.760 --> 2:03:38.280]  little baggy and then they break a vial and then they shake it is like ah turn blue you're carrying
[2:03:38.280 --> 2:03:43.800]  meth or you're carrying cannabis and it's all fake there's no science behind those tests did you
[2:03:43.800 --> 2:03:48.840]  know that they're all fake i mean the the flag positive results for all kinds of things cold
[2:03:48.840 --> 2:03:55.240]  medicine or oregano you know it's it's all a joke we've actually tested some of those at our lab
[2:03:55.240 --> 2:04:01.000]  and and they don't work but cops use them so they can falsely do whatever they want to do
[2:04:01.000 --> 2:04:08.520]  falsely arrest you well the cdc has us has a test now for ebola it's probably fake it probably flags
[2:04:08.520 --> 2:04:14.040]  the false positive most of the time so they can say oh you have ebola we're going to put you in
[2:04:14.040 --> 2:04:19.480]  quarantine or you have ebola you need the ebola vaccine shot and here you go here's the new FDA
[2:04:19.480 --> 2:04:24.760]  approved ebola vaccine shot guess what oh we accidentally had a batch that wasn't properly
[2:04:25.320 --> 2:04:31.560]  weakened with ultraviolet rays to denature the proteins of ebola turns out we accidentally
[2:04:31.560 --> 2:04:37.480]  allowed live ebola into the vaccine oh good thing the vaccine companies have no legal liability thanks
[2:04:37.480 --> 2:04:43.000]  to congress passing that law a couple decades ago and then all of a sudden you have an ebola
[2:04:43.000 --> 2:04:48.360]  outbreak what do you know just like we predicted we'll be back with your calls straight ahead here
[2:04:48.360 --> 2:05:07.880]  on the alex jones show well here we are in the year 2020 and old friends are not forgotten

[2:07:10.520 --> 2:07:15.320]  next few segments here on the alex jones show we're going to cover your predictions for 2020
[2:07:15.320 --> 2:07:21.320]  we've got collars lined up i'm going to go to denis here in just a second uh but first my contribution
[2:07:21.320 --> 2:07:28.280]  to this topic i did an article recently called civil war risk state by state that analyzes what i
[2:07:28.280 --> 2:07:33.480]  think is the civil war risk in 2020 in which states have the greatest potential for resulting in
[2:07:33.480 --> 2:07:37.080]  local or regional conflicts and i'll just mention right up front i think those states are not just
[2:07:37.080 --> 2:07:44.840]  virginia but also oregon washington pennsylvania colorado and potentially illinois so i don't
[2:07:44.840 --> 2:07:51.240]  see civil war risk in places like texas or new york but many other areas that have strong democratic
[2:07:51.240 --> 2:07:57.000]  control in the capital cities surrounded by rural americans who will not give up their second amendment
[2:07:57.000 --> 2:08:03.080]  rights i think there is a risk of conflict and it will extend beyond just 2020 by the way this could
[2:08:03.080 --> 2:08:07.800]  be a risk that continues to exist for the next five years especially if trump wins re-election
[2:08:07.800 --> 2:08:13.400]  which currently looks likely then the left is bound to go totally insane for the next few years but
[2:08:13.400 --> 2:08:18.680]  let's go to your calls and get your take on it and i want to remind collars again this is about
[2:08:18.680 --> 2:08:23.320]  predictions things you think might happen in 2020 and by the way you don't have to agree with me
[2:08:23.320 --> 2:08:28.520]  i welcome your diverse opinions i welcome your free speech so let's hear what denis has to say
[2:08:28.520 --> 2:08:36.520]  denis you're live with mike adams thanks for calling in thanks mike um the thing i'm most
[2:08:36.520 --> 2:08:49.800]  concerned about in the coming new year is the fact that mr trump hasn't addressed the the
[2:08:49.800 --> 2:09:01.240]  the source of all this chaos what do you think that source is well the source is the democratic party
[2:09:02.200 --> 2:09:08.200]  the democratic party and their uh coup attempt they're clearly coup attempts
[2:09:08.200 --> 2:09:21.720]  and he's he's trying to uh play coy and um kind of deflect their their coup attempt but
[2:09:22.440 --> 2:09:28.440]  in that he's frustrating the american people because we want to see justice we want to
[2:09:28.440 --> 2:09:33.000]  write i agree with you but do you think you think you should issue the have the military police go
[2:09:33.000 --> 2:09:37.400]  out and arrest the actual deep state traders charge them with treason uh invoke the insurrection
[2:09:37.400 --> 2:09:43.800]  act of 1807 what do you think you should do that way attacking him and they're attacking the the
[2:09:43.800 --> 2:09:51.560]  cornerstones of the social contract that the government has with the people we need law and
[2:09:51.560 --> 2:10:04.360]  order if you allow these people to um to endlessly accuse and attack the highest executive in the
[2:10:04.360 --> 2:10:09.240]  land the president so so Dennis everything you've said makes perfect sense but given that this is
[2:10:09.240 --> 2:10:13.880]  about what things may happen in 2020 what do you think is going to happen is trump going to take
[2:10:13.880 --> 2:10:18.280]  more decisive action even at the risk of being called a dictator where i guess he's called that
[2:10:18.280 --> 2:10:23.800]  every every day anyway what do you think is going to happen with this in 2020 well what i think is
[2:10:23.800 --> 2:10:32.520]  that as if he leaves if he leaves the democratic party to its own devices um the democratic party
[2:10:32.520 --> 2:10:38.680]  is going to be emboldened and the deep state is going to be emboldened and they are going to
[2:10:39.400 --> 2:10:48.360]  go ahead and um get us into a war just like they're trying to in iraq right now um they may get us
[2:10:48.360 --> 2:11:00.200]  into a war by um painting iran as a bad actor clearly it's a bad actor but it's not someone
[2:11:00.200 --> 2:11:09.240]  that we should take uh we should go to war with okay at the present time um the other thing is
[2:11:09.240 --> 2:11:16.120]  there the deep state is also comprised of all these arms or these organizations that
[2:11:17.480 --> 2:11:23.400]  are are stealing from the american people yeah you're you're absolutely right about that and it
[2:11:23.400 --> 2:11:28.360]  is time to expose and i think criminally indict literally thousands of people who've been part
[2:11:28.360 --> 2:11:31.560]  of this deep state i would imagine you would agree with that i thank you for your call dentis some
[2:11:32.280 --> 2:11:37.720]  good points all around let's see what other callers have to say about that let's go to terry
[2:11:37.720 --> 2:11:42.520]  in minnesota terry you're on live with mike adams here thanks for calling in what do you
[2:11:42.520 --> 2:11:48.440]  think's going to happen this year well i'll tell you what mike just a quick little background here
[2:11:48.440 --> 2:11:55.000]  um uh scriptually talking if you want to go back to the beginning uh this is real quick uh the
[2:11:55.000 --> 2:12:00.280]  babelonian you know the uh nimrod and all that crap then you go to meadow persia then you go to
[2:12:00.280 --> 2:12:08.680]  greece and go to roam then go to be a mohammedan kingdom which started in 636 ad up to 1948 um
[2:12:08.680 --> 2:12:14.280]  we started the fig tree generation um which uh everybody including you me and everybody else
[2:12:14.280 --> 2:12:18.040]  if you're a christian we were supposed to know what this generation's all about and we're talking
[2:12:18.040 --> 2:12:25.720]  about 2020 um the fig tree generation mike started in 1948 and where where are we 71 years now past
[2:12:25.720 --> 2:12:31.640]  that point um and i offer you this um according to the maps there's things will continue to
[2:12:31.640 --> 2:12:39.560]  wax worse and worse no stopping it um as far as 2020 is concerned um there's not going to be a lot
[2:12:39.560 --> 2:12:45.000]  coming out that's going to be good um the world war two guys um which you know are called the
[2:12:45.000 --> 2:12:51.000]  greatest generation were the people that were alive and in place when this all went down in 48
[2:12:51.640 --> 2:12:57.480]  and god said or christ said however you want to dice it and slice it that that generation before
[2:12:57.480 --> 2:13:02.920]  they're all gone and most of them are all almost all gone um will be the last one and i'm not talking
[2:13:02.920 --> 2:13:08.280]  mike about the end of the world not ending i'm talking about the end of the second birth age
[2:13:08.280 --> 2:13:14.440]  which is the end of flesh um and this is basically bible 101 and i know it's hard to have a conversation
[2:13:14.440 --> 2:13:19.320]  because most people in this massive christian nation the largest on earth are basically
[2:13:19.320 --> 2:13:24.200]  biblically illiterate and i'm not calling them stupid but yeah they just don't know what scripture
[2:13:24.200 --> 2:13:30.600]  really says well the massive failure mike of the majority of the pulpit is primarily why we're in
[2:13:30.600 --> 2:13:35.880]  this mess um you understand yeah yeah and so many of the churches have been turned against us and and
[2:13:35.880 --> 2:13:40.440]  look i don't mean to cut you off but i i do want to get a lot of opinions here today what you said
[2:13:40.440 --> 2:13:46.920]  makes a lot of sense there are um there are biblical events unfolding according to many people
[2:13:46.920 --> 2:13:50.760]  and many interpretations along those lines that should be looked at aggressively we only got two
[2:13:50.760 --> 2:13:55.400]  minutes of i thank you for your call terry let's let's go to trisha in virginia i'm just trying
[2:13:55.400 --> 2:14:00.200]  to get a lot of opinions here a lot of assessment of 2020 trisha you're on live with mike adams
[2:14:00.200 --> 2:14:06.360]  what's your take on things hi mike i've been a huge fan of yours for years and someday i would
[2:14:06.360 --> 2:14:13.240]  love to know what your Jesus moment was aside from that being in virginia um it's a it's a sad
[2:14:13.240 --> 2:14:19.560]  state of affairs here i believe that governor northam is pulling a chicago 2.0 i believe he's
[2:14:19.560 --> 2:14:25.480]  going to try and get the un to come in and take control of virginia because of its geography with
[2:14:25.480 --> 2:14:31.160]  washington dc i believe they're going to try and force trump out of washington dc physically
[2:14:31.160 --> 2:14:37.960]  because his his presence in dc will be threatened by the un presence wow so virginia is kind of a
[2:14:37.960 --> 2:14:43.240]  staging area to carry out a kinetic physical coup against trump is that what you're saying
[2:14:43.240 --> 2:14:49.080]  i do believe that i believe that polosi will use it as a a way to say that he's no longer in power
[2:14:49.080 --> 2:14:55.560]  because they had solution out of dc for his safety wow i believe what trump sees is coming i believe
[2:14:55.560 --> 2:15:01.560]  that's why he activated the marine corps reserves i don't think i don't believe his acting marine corps
[2:15:01.560 --> 2:15:06.760]  reserves had anything to do with the impeachment i believe he knows about the un troops in cuba

[2:15:12.680 --> 2:15:18.600]  believe to be i believe that virginia was selected because of its geography of washington dc yep and
[2:15:18.600 --> 2:15:24.440]  because they have to shut down not just the highways going into washington dc but hampton

[2:20:33.080 --> 2:20:37.960]  many callers right now we're talking about your analysis and predictions for 2020 what you think
[2:20:37.960 --> 2:20:42.680]  is going to happen we just had a caller who is still with us her name is trisha i think she's
[2:20:42.680 --> 2:20:49.560]  from virginia and she has a very very insightful analysis of how virginia may be used as a staging
[2:20:49.560 --> 2:20:57.400]  area to run a physical war coup against president trump and trisha are you still with us i am all
[2:20:57.400 --> 2:21:01.960]  right thank you i really appreciate your insight i can tell you're extremely well informed the
[2:21:01.960 --> 2:21:08.200]  question i have for you is do you think trump is fully aware of what's going on and does he have
[2:21:08.200 --> 2:21:14.360]  plans in place to invoke the military defense of the united states or is he going to just allow
[2:21:14.360 --> 2:21:21.160]  himself to be overrun by these lawless lunatics i'd like to think that he would take an offensive
[2:21:21.160 --> 2:21:27.720]  position as this is coming down the road adam i don't know i like what trump is doing overall but
[2:21:27.720 --> 2:21:34.760]  i still question what he's doing but he takes he's quiet and he takes his time him and juliani are
[2:21:34.760 --> 2:21:41.640]  very close to exposing a tremendous amount of corruption and they're doing a they're doing
[2:21:41.640 --> 2:21:46.280]  everything they can to keep that from coming out and they're going to they're going to cause
[2:21:46.280 --> 2:21:52.440]  mass chaos mass chaos in in virginia is going to be the spark they're going to use to do it you're
[2:21:52.440 --> 2:21:59.800]  talking about democrats the democrats are going to cause mass chaos yes yes and i i believe everybody
[2:21:59.800 --> 2:22:07.240]  across the country needs to right now we can see what's going on in virginia and watch unfortunately
[2:22:07.240 --> 2:22:12.120]  what is coming what is what is going to happen okay and they need to form second amendment
[2:22:12.120 --> 2:22:17.480]  counties all across the country and most important they absolutely have to protect their
[2:22:17.480 --> 2:22:21.240]  sheriffs they have to tell their sheriffs that they will protect their families that they will
[2:22:21.240 --> 2:22:26.120]  protect them because the government is going to come after the sheriff richmond has already called
[2:22:26.120 --> 2:22:32.200]  on it in in in uh in virginia yeah they're going to take the sheriffs out first and and if the
[2:22:32.200 --> 2:22:37.480]  country is not watching this they're fools you're absolutely right trisha and remember the democrats
[2:22:37.480 --> 2:22:42.040]  benefit from a civil war because they benefit from the chaos where they can call in the united
[2:22:42.040 --> 2:22:46.360]  nations and of course barack obama is behind the scenes pushing for that as well and that's
[2:22:46.360 --> 2:22:50.520]  what they want that you end to come in you end quote peacekeepers who are actually child traffickers
[2:22:50.520 --> 2:22:55.960]  and rapists and they'll go door to door confiscating your guns and you know basically destroying
[2:22:55.960 --> 2:23:00.600]  and overrunning your entire country trisha look you great points thanks for your call you you have
[2:23:00.600 --> 2:23:05.880]  have really nailed it let's i want to get a lot of opinions though today let's go to john in colorado
[2:23:05.880 --> 2:23:11.720]  john welcome to the show the notes here say you uh you've got thoughts about dems wanting to cause
[2:23:11.720 --> 2:23:21.000]  chaos in 2020 go ahead you're live hello hello you are you're on the air go ahead hey how's it going
[2:23:21.000 --> 2:23:25.320]  yeah i mean it's hard to it's hard to follow up after what trish just said i mean she pretty much
[2:23:25.320 --> 2:23:31.400]  just covered everything yeah she nailed it yeah i'm pretty you know it just seems like the democrats
[2:23:31.400 --> 2:23:36.680]  you know they they have nothing to lose it's kind of like a cornered rabid raccoon and they could
[2:23:36.680 --> 2:23:42.920]  pretty much do anything and they're capable of anything to try to save their own hides well
[2:23:42.920 --> 2:23:47.560]  they aren't capable of anything what do you think they're going to actually pull i mean i've we've
[2:23:47.560 --> 2:23:54.600]  talked about you know nuking the democrats actually nuking some some area to try to cause a war or
[2:23:54.600 --> 2:24:00.760]  unleashing biological weapons or causing a a grid down or or market crash what what do you think
[2:24:00.760 --> 2:24:08.200]  they're they're actually willing to do i think they would prefer to keep poking at um you know
[2:24:08.200 --> 2:24:14.920]  like sending wackos into churches and synagogues i think they would really just what they would like
[2:24:14.920 --> 2:24:22.360]  was is for the conservatives and the the right wing to start proactively fighting back in hopes
[2:24:22.360 --> 2:24:29.000]  to demonize them more okay but we're very patient people capable of terrible things
[2:24:29.000 --> 2:24:34.600]  so you think they're going to follow the uh barack obama community organizing track
[2:24:35.240 --> 2:24:40.680]  to sow chaos all over the country but at low level like kind of a bottom up approach to chaos
[2:24:40.680 --> 2:24:46.520]  yeah more more skirmishes because i think they would benefit from it being organic in appearance
[2:24:47.080 --> 2:24:51.000]  yeah you're right about that and they are good at staging that especially since the media
[2:24:51.000 --> 2:24:56.200]  is now basically a left-wing terrorist organization running psychological ops against
[2:24:56.200 --> 2:25:01.320]  the american people but john uh your your comments are right on i appreciate your call thank you for
[2:25:01.320 --> 2:25:07.400]  for chiming in let's go to jacob in hawaii uh who's got some comments about north korea jacob
[2:25:07.400 --> 2:25:12.440]  you're live on the air with mike adams here thanks for calling in what what do you got for us uh for
[2:25:12.440 --> 2:25:18.440]  your family is a completely evil and happy new year from molly i'm looking at the specific
[2:25:18.440 --> 2:25:26.600]  ocean looking out west towards uh asia and uh you know um we're coming up on anniversary of the
[2:25:27.480 --> 2:25:31.560]  you know the false alarm that came out on our phones for all of the residents
[2:25:31.560 --> 2:25:38.360]  feeling yeah the false uh nuclear launch or what was that yeah i mean yeah so when i was
[2:25:38.360 --> 2:25:45.000]  driving down the h1 freeway when that happened and um you know it terrified it terrified us i mean
[2:25:45.000 --> 2:25:53.000]  you know i mean talk about chickens running with their heads cut off um anyways so since that happened
[2:25:53.000 --> 2:25:56.520]  you know they they said oh the guy hit the wrong button the guy hit the wrong button
[2:25:57.960 --> 2:26:04.680]  and so and so and so for me i've been i've been following the geopolitical landscapes since 2001
[2:26:04.680 --> 2:26:10.040]  when i didn't take uh their story for 9 11 for an answer so of course yeah you know i'm looking
[2:26:10.040 --> 2:26:15.240]  into alex jones and then um you know i hear about q and on 10 days before saying missile
[2:26:15.240 --> 2:26:22.840]  missile flash hunt for it october slash why false uh there's basically predicting what happened so
[2:26:23.640 --> 2:26:29.080]  you know we're pearl harbor the day before pearl harbor less than 10 percent of americans wanted
[2:26:29.080 --> 2:26:34.360]  to be involved in world war two the day after a million men signed up so hawaii was already a
[2:26:34.360 --> 2:26:38.760]  spot for a false flag it's already happened one so do you think that they could take that live
[2:26:38.760 --> 2:26:44.360]  that they're willing to do that actual do do like a pearl harbor or even a false flag nuke
[2:26:44.360 --> 2:26:49.320]  in america that that's how desperate the deep state is well i they're so desperate that you
[2:26:49.320 --> 2:26:55.640]  know that the cia they have their own road aircraft carriers and uh all their own military
[2:26:55.640 --> 2:27:00.600]  equipment to go and stage something and we all know that the intelligence community hates
[2:27:00.600 --> 2:27:05.400]  donald trump yes and hawaii is just like we're just like this little brother out here and like
[2:27:05.400 --> 2:27:11.240]  oh yeah you know we can sacrifice hawaii even though we have you know you know it's a perfect
[2:27:11.240 --> 2:27:16.760]  spot for a false flag so you think the the the false missile alert might have been a run up to a
[2:27:16.760 --> 2:27:24.120]  live missile to attack hawaii and maybe what blame north korea or what i i believe it was one of two
[2:27:24.120 --> 2:27:30.440]  things either we got hacked and they wanted to see how we would respond or two that there actually
[2:27:30.440 --> 2:27:35.400]  was a threat that was taken out and they tried to trick trump into a war with north korea and
[2:27:35.400 --> 2:27:42.520]  but he stood down i see ahead of his pre-planned communication with with kim jong-un even if
[2:27:42.520 --> 2:27:49.800]  it was it would whatever it whatever it was i believe that this that hawaii is sitting smack
[2:27:49.800 --> 2:27:57.720]  dab in the middle of this uh jake of you know the south south south china sea and how china
[2:27:57.720 --> 2:28:02.040]  you know a lot of people don't know that north korea and south korea weren't fighting each other
[2:28:02.040 --> 2:28:06.920]  china was backing north korea and we're backing the united states and china does not want to
[2:28:06.920 --> 2:28:13.240]  unify peninsula under america so i feel like okay has been also used kim jong-un is like
[2:28:13.240 --> 2:28:17.640]  of this little you know like like this little like dog or somebody wants to stick on people
[2:28:17.640 --> 2:28:20.840]  you know so i don't what are you what are your thoughts what do you know is there anything you
[2:28:20.840 --> 2:28:28.440]  can share oh boy wow yeah don't get me started because uh the things i hear from some of my contacts
[2:28:28.440 --> 2:28:34.520]  are mind-blowing some of them i can't i can't yet confirm through multiple sources some i'm not
[2:28:34.520 --> 2:28:38.280]  yet willing to talk about but i think you're on the right track there jacob and they are
[2:28:38.280 --> 2:28:44.200]  willing to sacrifice millions of americans lives in order to defeat trump that i'm sure of now we
[2:28:44.200 --> 2:28:48.280]  got to take a break and thank you for your call jacob we're going to come back with more callers

[2:29:14.440 --> 2:29:18.920]  off the grid the clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on
[2:29:18.920 --> 2:29:23.240]  the east bank of the mississippi because of the flooding we've had to move a lot of our inventory
[2:29:23.240 --> 2:29:27.720]  to a temporary location and rather than move it back to the warehouse we thought we'd offer the
[2:29:27.720 --> 2:29:32.760]  system at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the flood water's backstory so

[2:33:36.680 --> 2:33:43.960]  day of 2020 we are live broadcasting from austin texas and i think most of the callers here so far
[2:33:43.960 --> 2:33:48.920]  have agreed with the idea that this is going to be a year of incredible chaos things that the
[2:33:48.920 --> 2:33:53.640]  democrats in the deep state are planning to do to try to protect themselves from being exposed
[2:33:53.640 --> 2:34:00.360]  indicted maybe charged with treason by the trump administration because ruta juliani has stumbled
[2:34:00.360 --> 2:34:06.840]  into some well billion dollar scandals being run by democrats and people like joe biden hunter
[2:34:06.840 --> 2:34:12.600]  biden and so on uh if that comes out maybe a lot of people go into prison so what are the democrats
[2:34:12.600 --> 2:34:16.600]  willing to do to stop that that's kind of the subject of what we're talking about today i'm
[2:34:16.600 --> 2:34:22.600]  going to go to craig in washington state craig you're live with mike adams here on the show

[2:34:57.640 --> 2:35:05.800]  that cannot fight back and as i look around me i see the kind of characters so are you seeing
[2:35:05.800 --> 2:35:11.160]  talking about like the population around you is morphing into passive zombies or something what

[2:35:32.840 --> 2:35:41.320]  the way why the circus continues next year in dc what do you keep your guns why they install 5g

[2:35:47.880 --> 2:35:52.360]  a lot donald trump craig where do you live in washington i mean roughly are you close to
[2:35:52.360 --> 2:35:59.000]  seattle are you more rural i work in seattle i used to live in seattle you know i bought a house
[2:35:59.000 --> 2:36:05.480]  down south because can't afford it in seattle anymore but yet seattle has changed but don't
[2:36:05.480 --> 2:36:11.560]  you think a lot of rural washingtonians you know east of seattle you know they don't put
[2:36:11.560 --> 2:36:15.160]  up with this 5g stuff and they're they're better informed about vaccines and second amendment
[2:36:15.160 --> 2:36:22.680]  and so on i mean what's your take on that windmills everywhere when i go home now windmills used to be
[2:36:22.680 --> 2:36:30.280]  beautiful views of the cascades now it's beautiful windmills really so yeah well they're saying
[2:36:31.400 --> 2:36:37.400]  smart people can be easily uh you know once they've gotten shot up with the vaccines that's
[2:36:37.400 --> 2:36:42.920]  where they took alex off the air obviously it's where they took you off yep you're exactly right
[2:36:42.920 --> 2:36:48.920]  and and the vaccine deep state is running the media and in fact have you noticed that comedians now
[2:36:48.920 --> 2:36:56.120]  now they are paid to have pro-vaccine jokes in their stand-up routines you look at any
[2:36:56.120 --> 2:37:01.400]  comedian on netflix now pretty good chance they're going to attack anti-vaxxers on netflix but really
[2:37:01.400 --> 2:37:06.760]  really good points there craig from washington state best of luck to you dodging windmills
[2:37:06.760 --> 2:37:12.360]  and the uh the the liberal zombies out there uh i hope i hope you are prepared for what's coming
[2:37:12.360 --> 2:37:17.720]  let's go to lauren from ohio lauren you're live on the air thank you for joining us today
[2:37:17.720 --> 2:37:23.720]  uh what's on your mind for 2020 yeah i'm looking more at solutions and looking less at what they're
[2:37:23.720 --> 2:37:29.960]  doing and more at what i'm doing myself that's great to hear yeah and here's the deal in the end
[2:37:29.960 --> 2:37:35.880]  we fight back by obeying god it's really a simple solution obey god and i'm talking like half of the
[2:37:35.880 --> 2:37:40.840]  tank commandment can we not steal from each other can we not covet each other's things or murder each
[2:37:40.840 --> 2:37:46.120]  other these are things that even if you're an atheist you can get with that right so obey god
[2:37:46.120 --> 2:37:51.480]  keep your money in your pocket if you don't owe taxes stop paying them they're using your money
[2:37:51.480 --> 2:37:57.320]  to destroy you you don't owe them the fruit of your labor the way this government was established
[2:37:57.320 --> 2:38:03.240]  god made the men the men made a club the club made rules code regulations and statutes to manage the
[2:38:03.240 --> 2:38:10.520]  maids and the butlers of the club not to manage the free king which theater has the right to control
[2:38:10.520 --> 2:38:16.920]  well why is it lauren that that people so easily turn into sheeple and agree to go along with this
[2:38:16.920 --> 2:38:22.360]  obvious tyranny right in in your face uh they're coming after your children with drag queen story
[2:38:22.360 --> 2:38:27.880]  hour you know lgbt indoctrination they're they're they're stealing from you constantly by creating
[2:38:27.880 --> 2:38:33.480]  new money and diluting the money supply why are people so willing to go along with this the third
[2:38:33.480 --> 2:38:37.800]  step in that program was keep your children in your home meaning homeschooling or control their
[2:38:37.800 --> 2:38:42.760]  education meaning hire somebody you know five families on a block you hire somebody and they
[2:38:42.760 --> 2:38:48.680]  here's a globe here's a map here's a facts and math curriculum here's you know how biology really
[2:38:48.680 --> 2:38:54.440]  works you know no evolution no global warming no no training story time no you can pick your
[2:38:54.440 --> 2:39:00.120]  stack they're lying to the children you you guys know charlotte is or be this is in deliberate
[2:39:00.120 --> 2:39:04.600]  dumbing down dot com this is what they're doing so do you do you homeschool do you have children
[2:39:04.600 --> 2:39:10.680]  over to them do do you homeschool or have you before oh yeah i ran for state school board in
[2:39:10.680 --> 2:39:16.760]  ohio and so i went to the meetings every year you know for a year and what i spent we're in a state
[2:39:16.760 --> 2:39:21.480]  where the superintendent of schools a couple years ago lied and and changed the test scores of the
[2:39:21.480 --> 2:39:26.760]  kids to make it look like they were smarter than they were right remember that this is all based
[2:39:26.760 --> 2:39:32.440]  on lies but see if we did things that way you wouldn't be able to get at it with get at us with
[2:39:32.440 --> 2:39:37.880]  these lies if i control your child from eight in the morning till four or five in the afternoon
[2:39:37.880 --> 2:39:43.240]  i'm the one who's raising your child that's not the mother you can you bore that child
[2:39:43.960 --> 2:39:49.880]  but you're not doing the work of motherhood that work includes the development the spiritual
[2:39:49.880 --> 2:39:55.640]  development of the child well the democrats say that motherhood is a bad thing now or fatherhood
[2:39:55.640 --> 2:39:59.560]  or even a family for that i mean they're attacking the very structure of sustainable
[2:39:59.560 --> 2:40:04.120]  civilization that has brought us through all the history of humanity to this point
[2:40:04.120 --> 2:40:08.520]  now it's all under attack it's like they want they hate humanity basically well they do but
[2:40:08.520 --> 2:40:12.440]  the thing is they're teaching your children to hate themselves you've got this mass suicide rate
[2:40:12.440 --> 2:40:17.800]  in white men my i'm building the house right now for my friend whose grandson 26 years old
[2:40:17.800 --> 2:40:25.240]  just killed themselves i mean my my i know five people five white men i should not know five
[2:40:25.240 --> 2:40:31.000]  white men that have killed themselves two of them being 26 you know my niece okay why are people
[2:40:31.000 --> 2:40:36.920]  killing themselves because you don't turn your child over to death education and there is no god
[2:40:36.920 --> 2:40:43.000]  and why are you sure you're a boy or hey let's cut off your junk yeah so well look that they're
[2:40:43.000 --> 2:40:50.760]  attacking white just being white they say whites are bad and they say being male is bad so i guess
[2:40:50.760 --> 2:40:55.880]  we shouldn't be surprised that certain number of white males are are finding it miserable to exist
[2:40:55.880 --> 2:41:00.120]  in this society it seems to be what the radical left wants is just hey all white people they just
[2:41:00.120 --> 2:41:03.880]  want them to go kill themselves well this is my point and we can take this from them with that
[2:41:03.880 --> 2:41:10.600]  little four step plan obey god keep your money in your pocket his advocates.org if you're not a
[2:41:10.600 --> 2:41:16.920]  christian and you want to just be a secular and do it that way state citizen.org okay all right
[2:41:16.920 --> 2:41:21.320]  keep your children in your home control their education yeah it's your own fault if you send
[2:41:21.320 --> 2:41:26.520]  your children off all day and so i don't want to hear about oh i didn't know what happened yeah you
[2:41:26.520 --> 2:41:31.720]  do you understand at this point what's going on and it's about changing what you're doing and the
[2:41:31.720 --> 2:41:37.720]  last thing boycott big business why are we using these giant establishments all this money i just
[2:41:37.720 --> 2:41:43.640]  ordered i think i put three orders in with alex in the last month well wise words there lauren i
[2:41:43.640 --> 2:41:46.920]  don't mean to cut you off but i want to go to one more call before we go to break but lauren you nailed
[2:41:46.920 --> 2:41:52.120]  it obey god keep your children in your home home school them teaching the truth very good information
[2:41:52.120 --> 2:41:56.520]  that's how we fight back against the control systems and the death systems that are now targeting
[2:41:56.520 --> 2:42:01.080]  your children let's go to wild man in missouri we're about to go to break in one of it one minute
[2:42:01.080 --> 2:42:05.960]  but go ahead wild man what do you got for us yeah yeah i think trumps failed the litmus test on
[2:42:05.960 --> 2:42:12.120]  so many issues such as election meddling voter fraud border security joint size no deep state
[2:42:12.120 --> 2:42:18.680]  arrest no 9 11 full disclosure failed on the censorship the second amendment i think he's
[2:42:18.680 --> 2:42:23.800]  been a confirmation to a lot of people that no matter who holds the presidency that the globalist
[2:42:23.800 --> 2:42:28.920]  the banking cartels and the corporate technocracy hold the real power but on a positive note i think
[2:42:28.920 --> 2:42:33.720]  trump the biggest thing is he's woken a lot of people up and he's really been a buffer zone
[2:42:33.720 --> 2:42:40.440]  this last four years for people that think to really uh you know dig in and prepare and he's
[2:42:40.440 --> 2:42:45.560]  really been a benefit to the prepping community as far as giving us a wild man we gotta go to break
[2:42:45.560 --> 2:42:49.720]  stay with us we want to come back to you after this break you're watching the alex jones show
[2:42:49.720 --> 2:42:52.120]  and again wild man stay with us we'll be right back after this break
[2:42:55.160 --> 2:42:59.160]  so what's the most important part let's say in a bulldozer running over the globalist the treads
[2:42:59.160 --> 2:43:04.680]  the wheels the engine the scoop on the front it's all very important but the fuel is paramount and
[2:43:04.680 --> 2:43:11.320]  that's my allegory turbo force is vitamins minerals amino acids that synergistically work with six
[2:43:11.320 --> 2:43:16.120]  different natural forms of healthy clean energy that last for 10 hours in the average metabolic
[2:43:16.120 --> 2:43:19.960]  system metabolism of a human some people get 15 hours out of some people get about eight hours
[2:43:19.960 --> 2:43:24.200]  but people take this people taking sports people cannot believe it's the best they've ever had

[2:48:24.200 --> 2:48:30.440]  mike adams health ranger filling in for alex today at least for these segments and we're taking user
[2:48:30.440 --> 2:48:36.680]  calls a lot of good calls have come in already predictions about 2020 what may be coming and
[2:48:36.680 --> 2:48:41.480]  we were talking to wild man right before the break from missouri just want to go back to wild man
[2:48:41.480 --> 2:48:46.040]  you still there on the phone yes sir all right thank you just got a question for you mentioned
[2:48:46.040 --> 2:48:50.840]  right up front you mentioned some of the failings of president trump so far he's failed on censorship
[2:48:50.840 --> 2:48:55.480]  he's you know he's failed to stop the deep state attacks and and many things he's failed to fully
[2:48:55.480 --> 2:49:01.480]  protect the border of course he's had a lot of you know internal resistance betrayals traders
[2:49:01.480 --> 2:49:07.640]  working in the system but i agree with you what is this is my question to you what's he waiting for
[2:49:07.640 --> 2:49:12.120]  on censorship he could take action right now he could issue an executive order he could have the
[2:49:12.120 --> 2:49:18.280]  ftc issue a ruling what what on earth is he waiting for he doesn't realize he's going to lose the
[2:49:18.280 --> 2:49:24.360]  election if if we don't get free speech or sword and it's things like that that to me are just a
[2:49:24.360 --> 2:49:29.640]  confirmation that that he doesn't hold the real power that you know that the that the corporate
[2:49:29.640 --> 2:49:34.360]  technocracy that the banking cartels that the globalists are really the ones pulling the strings
[2:49:34.360 --> 2:49:40.280]  and like i said i think on a good note more than anything his presidency has been a buffer zone for
[2:49:40.280 --> 2:49:46.360]  us like many people that are see you know what's coming on the horizon and he's gave us time to
[2:49:46.360 --> 2:49:50.360]  further prepare you know i really didn't start prepping till trump got elected and all this
[2:49:50.360 --> 2:49:55.880]  craziness started going on he's really exposed the left and he's done us a big favor with that
[2:49:55.880 --> 2:50:01.000]  and you know he could be doing something about virginia and he's not saying nothing about that
[2:50:01.000 --> 2:50:05.800]  you know well say his stance on on gun control and stuff you know i like your analysis where
[2:50:05.800 --> 2:50:10.520]  trump has given us the time to act because ultimately this comes down to we the people
[2:50:10.520 --> 2:50:14.120]  we cannot sit back and just say oh president trump's going to fix everything he's going to
[2:50:14.120 --> 2:50:19.560]  solve everything he is surrounded by traders and deep staters and we the people are going to have
[2:50:19.560 --> 2:50:25.320]  to probably save this country in the end but i look i appreciate your call wild man a cool username
[2:50:25.320 --> 2:50:30.520]  there from missouri uh keep up your preps you're going to need it that's my assessment and i hope
[2:50:30.520 --> 2:50:35.640]  you're not anywhere near the big cities of kansas city or st louis when things go south
[2:50:35.640 --> 2:50:40.680]  missouri is one of those areas that could be impacted let's go to bob in michigan with some
[2:50:40.680 --> 2:50:46.280]  comments it says about censorship and uh trump will lose if the censorship isn't ended is that
[2:50:46.280 --> 2:50:51.640]  what you're saying there bob you're live yes yes i i really believe that i believe that unless
[2:50:52.360 --> 2:50:58.840]  the trump administration starts taking censorship very seriously that he will lose in the 2020
[2:50:58.840 --> 2:51:04.280]  election because you've got to take the left seriously they're they're a very well organized
[2:51:04.280 --> 2:51:10.920]  enemy of ours they lie lie and lie and most of their people believe those lies so they think
[2:51:10.920 --> 2:51:17.720]  they're just as right as we are and if we don't keep the free speech out front and try to end
[2:51:17.720 --> 2:51:23.800]  censorship on search engines and on social media our voice is going to be overshadowed by the leftist
[2:51:23.800 --> 2:51:28.600]  voice and i'm really i want to get this message to president trump if we don't do something about
[2:51:28.600 --> 2:51:34.520]  censorship president trump will lose the next election i agree with you bob i've said the
[2:51:34.520 --> 2:51:39.320]  exact same thing and as you know i've been building alternative platforms uh and so
[2:51:39.320 --> 2:51:44.360]  is info wars band dot video i've got bright on dot com uh we're rolling out a new search engine for
[2:51:44.360 --> 2:51:49.480]  health topics website dot com it's launching in less than a month but even these efforts are tiny
[2:51:49.480 --> 2:51:54.360]  compared to the control of google and facebook and youtube and so on i agree with you trump doesn't
[2:51:54.360 --> 2:51:59.560]  take action on this it's not only over for him it's over for our republic it's over for a country
[2:51:59.560 --> 2:52:04.680]  i mean what gives google the right to decide that people can't find the truth about vaccines and
[2:52:04.680 --> 2:52:08.600]  parents talking about their children who have been harmed by vaccines you try to search for that on
[2:52:08.600 --> 2:52:15.080]  google it's just gone it's vanished because that's their agenda so uh last question for you here bob
[2:52:16.360 --> 2:52:21.640]  do you think he'll ever take action or will he refuse to or or is he incapable of it because of
[2:52:21.640 --> 2:52:26.280]  the traders who surround him i think he will take action but we've got to put the pressure on him
[2:52:26.280 --> 2:52:30.440]  and i want to mention too that you know why the the left is talking about russian collusion all the
[2:52:30.440 --> 2:52:35.800]  time they're covering up their election fraud and there's going to be election fraud this year
[2:52:35.800 --> 2:52:39.960]  they're going to be dead people voting they're going to be multiple people voting melt in multiple
[2:52:39.960 --> 2:52:45.720]  times and they're covering up with russian collusion to to rig our elections that's far from the truth
[2:52:45.720 --> 2:52:50.520]  but that's what they're selling and we've got to fight that through three free speech well i agree
[2:52:50.520 --> 2:52:57.320]  with you bob what so what happens if the left steals this election trump loses what happens to
[2:52:57.320 --> 2:53:04.680]  america at that moment i think we're going to have a civil war okay what would that look like
[2:53:04.680 --> 2:53:09.240]  what armed million armed people marching on washington or are you talking state by state what
[2:53:09.240 --> 2:53:14.920]  do you think uh i think we'll have a big mass march on washington and i i don't know what's
[2:53:14.920 --> 2:53:20.600]  going to happen after that depends how the army comes down yeah good point which is why obama put
[2:53:20.600 --> 2:53:26.680]  in hundreds of you know pro-globalist military leaders in the pentagon and throughout the
[2:53:26.680 --> 2:53:31.000]  service the the various branches of the armed services but trump has had some success replacing
[2:53:31.000 --> 2:53:35.560]  some of those and he's replaced a lot of federal judges too yeah and he's working on it but he's
[2:53:35.560 --> 2:53:40.840]  got to work on censorship first and then the election fraud second but that's the that's the
[2:53:40.840 --> 2:53:46.360]  biggest thing if we don't get that done we're in big trouble agree with you bob a very good insight
[2:53:46.360 --> 2:53:50.920]  thank you from from michigan there thank you for your call let's go to ted in utah with
[2:53:50.920 --> 2:53:57.160]  comments about free energy predictions for 2020 ted you're you're live on the air i i love your
[2:53:57.160 --> 2:54:02.200]  topic we've talked about you know low energy nuclear reactions liner before what what's on
[2:54:02.200 --> 2:54:11.080]  your mind for 2020 yeah hi mike um you know i've been working on uh free energy and actually
[2:54:11.080 --> 2:54:18.920]  ufo propulsion uh something that i you know i just had to do since i was a kid just like
[2:54:18.920 --> 2:54:24.600]  alex he made a promise to god he was going to do it and that's basically what i did but um
[2:54:24.600 --> 2:54:32.440]  um yeah if if you have you ever heard of uh ed gray's conversion tube no i'm not familiar with
[2:54:32.440 --> 2:54:37.000]  that sounds like you've got some energy running behind you though you can you get to a quieter area
[2:54:38.280 --> 2:54:43.240]  oh i'm sorry about my phone yeah i know it's like a machine or something um
[2:54:45.560 --> 2:54:52.920]  is that better no but go ahead with your point we we can kind of make it out okay well my point
[2:54:52.920 --> 2:54:58.440]  is that that we've had free energy uh and the government's had it you know for at least 100
[2:54:58.440 --> 2:55:06.200]  years now and uh they're holding it back i don't you know i kind of kind of understand why the
[2:55:06.200 --> 2:55:13.880]  politically uh because if ever that's a whole world had free energy um uh you know you could
[2:55:13.880 --> 2:55:18.920]  turn that into a weapon and when you have all these dictators around uh it's it could be a little
[2:55:18.920 --> 2:55:26.280]  dangerous so well plus they use they use the uh the fossil fuels to control everybody you know
[2:55:26.280 --> 2:55:31.880]  scarcity is the model of global control whether it's food or or energy right you can't have the
[2:55:31.880 --> 2:55:35.880]  people having freedom for god's sake you know freedom to to think freedom to speak freedom to
[2:55:35.880 --> 2:55:42.600]  have energy oh what a what a horrible idea if you're a globalist right right well but what do you
[2:55:42.600 --> 2:55:51.880]  think is going to happen in 2020 well i i think uh free energy is going to be released i think that
[2:55:51.880 --> 2:55:57.400]  ufo electromagnetic propulsion is going to be released there's going to be no more rockets
[2:55:57.400 --> 2:56:06.360]  there's going to be no more need for uh it's going to be like a atlantis utopia on the whole planet
[2:56:06.360 --> 2:56:12.520]  if we don't kill each other that's what i'm thinking that's the quote of the day it will be utopia if
[2:56:12.520 --> 2:56:18.280]  we don't kill each other i like that i i appreciate your call there ted and uh yeah it'll be utopia
[2:56:18.280 --> 2:56:24.520]  and also marvel will have a transgender superhero next year there we go so what what what could go
[2:56:24.520 --> 2:56:29.960]  wrong with with you know transgender superheroes what would be like uh i don't know like like
[2:56:29.960 --> 2:56:36.520]  dr trans who can see the future of multiple genders or something it's going to be insane
[2:56:36.520 --> 2:56:40.920]  but thanks for your call there ted i agree some interesting things are going to happen in the
[2:56:40.920 --> 2:56:46.280]  energy sector let's go to paul in california we've only got a minute left paul so go right into it
[2:56:46.280 --> 2:56:51.080]  the note says here uh something about bible prophecy in israel what what's on your mind
[2:56:52.040 --> 2:56:59.080]  yeah uh we hear a lot of people bring up the bible uh regarding prophecy and uh i feel they
[2:56:59.080 --> 2:57:05.640]  start with uh like in many other areas of uh politics and everything they start with a
[2:57:05.640 --> 2:57:14.840]  basic premise that's not accurate and uh that's that uh the current state that is associated
[2:57:14.840 --> 2:57:23.000]  with bible prophecy today is uh is anybody who believes that is not going to understand bible
[2:57:23.000 --> 2:57:30.440]  prophecy at all all right so there's not being taught correctly uh i'm sure a lot of different
[2:57:30.440 --> 2:57:34.200]  variations and interpretations of it good thoughts look we're going to take a break
[2:57:34.200 --> 2:57:38.440]  we'll be back after this break with a fourth hour mike adams here on the alex jones show

[2:59:50.680 --> 3:00:07.400]  all right you're watching the alex jones show
[3:00:09.000 --> 3:00:13.320]  this is an important article up on info wars dot com today the new york un office recruits
[3:00:13.320 --> 3:00:20.520]  paramilitary troops for disarmament and quote reintegration of us civilians this is from
[3:00:20.520 --> 3:00:28.040]  national file i think this is one of the biggest articles i've seen a long time that this this is
[3:00:28.760 --> 3:00:37.080]  proof that the un is planning something nefarious right here on us soil and we had a caller earlier
[3:00:37.080 --> 3:00:42.040]  trisha i think was her name that talked about virginia being used as a staging area to try to
[3:00:42.040 --> 3:00:47.560]  pull off an armed coup against president trump and i don't think that's out of the box thinking i
[3:00:47.560 --> 3:00:52.040]  think that is right in line with what the democrats are doing but what we've been doing here today on
[3:00:52.040 --> 3:00:56.600]  the alex jones show is taking calls from some of the listeners who have their predictions
[3:00:56.600 --> 3:01:01.800]  and analyses for 2020 and we're going to continue that for the next few minutes and then after that
[3:01:01.800 --> 3:01:08.200]  i'll cover some cosmic mysteries as we get into the fourth hour but let's go to john in florida
[3:01:08.200 --> 3:01:13.800]  john you're live on the air you've got comments about civil unrest and deep state entrenchment it
[3:01:13.800 --> 3:01:20.600]  says is that is that right what's on your mind well you mentioned it correctly antonio gutierrez
[3:01:20.600 --> 3:01:27.320]  who heads the un he's the un secretary he was leader of is which is the older oldest communist
[3:01:27.320 --> 3:01:33.080]  organization in the world the international socialist organization you're always hearing
[3:01:33.080 --> 3:01:39.160]  about this term democratic socialism well democratic socialism is by very definition
[3:01:39.160 --> 3:01:46.280]  menschewick communism and if i could quote adolf hitler adolf hitler said when one opposes me
[3:01:46.280 --> 3:01:54.200]  i simply say who are you you will pass on your children however now stand in the new camp and
[3:01:54.200 --> 3:02:00.280]  in a short time will know nothing else but my new community now that said i traveled the united
[3:02:00.280 --> 3:02:07.560]  states for two and a half years it's a dilapidated dump i've been in texas numerous times one fourth
[3:02:07.560 --> 3:02:13.720]  of texas doesn't speak english one fourth of texas doesn't even have english speaking radio
[3:02:13.720 --> 3:02:21.000]  stations so texas has fallen we don't have the intelligence nor the resources to fight
[3:02:21.000 --> 3:02:28.600]  this communist invasion and it's already here the odni is a social justice puke bucket you don't
[3:02:28.600 --> 3:02:36.280]  have a department of justice you have the 1917 espionage act the 1950 mccaron act of 1939 smith
[3:02:36.280 --> 3:02:43.400]  act this president is not andrew jackson who we tout so vehemently he's andrew johnson
[3:02:44.360 --> 3:02:48.840]  okay who was basically you know tried to bring the two the north and the south together
[3:02:48.840 --> 3:02:54.280]  wind up being a joke so do you think is there is there a day that this fall accelerates will
[3:02:54.280 --> 3:03:01.400]  there be a communist war announced to just go start killing all patriots or how does this
[3:03:01.400 --> 3:03:05.880]  shape up or how does it look what does it look like when this happens or is it just a slow erosion
[3:03:05.880 --> 3:03:09.240]  that you've been describing and i think you i think you're describing it accurately by the way
[3:03:09.880 --> 3:03:15.400]  well homeland security is unconstitutional the patriot act is unconstitutional
[3:03:15.400 --> 3:03:20.120]  fires the courts are unconstitutional right you know they they'd like urie benzmanoff said
[3:03:20.120 --> 3:03:25.000]  they've done this over decades and it's already succeeded half of the republican party didn't
[3:03:25.000 --> 3:03:30.040]  even like honorable president ronald reagan and i believe it was george h w bush that undermine
[3:03:30.040 --> 3:03:37.400]  rattle reagan and al salvador guanamalan honduras we have traitors in this country now the funny
[3:03:37.400 --> 3:03:42.360]  thing is now you don't even have freedom of speech yeah speech legislation is unconstitutional on
[3:03:42.360 --> 3:03:48.920]  its face period the only speech that you don't have under the constitution and it mentions this
[3:03:48.920 --> 3:03:56.440]  numerous times in the constitution is the dishes speech speech to overthrow the social contract
[3:03:56.440 --> 3:04:02.040]  which what michael bloomberg is doing right now it is billions of dollars trying to overthrow
[3:04:02.040 --> 3:04:08.760]  the second amendment where is the department of justice that's right we're it's already late in
[3:04:08.760 --> 3:04:13.560]  the game we've already lost so much why aren't there millions of people peacefully marching in
[3:04:13.560 --> 3:04:18.600]  the streets right now demanding the arrest of all those for example who are violating the second
[3:04:18.600 --> 3:04:25.640]  amendment or violating the first amendment it's late in this in this saga and america is falling
[3:04:25.640 --> 3:04:30.200]  right now if we don't reverse it well look we got to go to break john but i think you are spot on
[3:04:30.200 --> 3:04:35.080]  with your comments and your warnings and if we don't heed these warnings america will fall
[3:04:35.640 --> 3:04:40.360]  but will 2020 be the year that we turn this around will there be a mass awakening could it be along
[3:04:40.360 --> 3:04:44.760]  the lines of virginia and the second amendment or maybe a trump reelection maybe trump comes

[3:06:45.160 --> 3:06:52.680]  thank you sir uh my my thing is this you know either either 200 plus years of the power of the
[3:06:52.680 --> 3:07:00.760]  presidency exhibited to the people is an absolute lie or trump is an absolute coward or the other
[3:07:00.760 --> 3:07:06.680]  option this is that he's in on the whole deal uh you know this guy you take for example i mean
[3:07:06.680 --> 3:07:13.400]  even in the simplest things right uh all of these people who helped trump get elected okay whether it
[3:07:13.400 --> 3:07:20.120]  be julie anassange or uh maniford or or all of these people that are sitting in jail uh roger stone
[3:07:20.120 --> 3:07:25.880]  soon to be sitting in jail alex jones hopefully won't be sitting in jail but you know he hasn't
[3:07:25.880 --> 3:07:34.280]  done anything for these people nothing and he's not going to um do you think do you think that he is
[3:07:35.080 --> 3:07:41.640]  well you i mean use the word coward is he afraid to take action or is he waiting for something
[3:07:41.640 --> 3:07:46.840]  like vindication from the senate or is he just too far gone maybe he's not even in charge anymore
[3:07:46.840 --> 3:07:52.440]  maybe it's jared running everything yeah mike uh that's that's that's a bingo right there but look
[3:07:52.440 --> 3:07:59.800]  uh you know i think that there's always an excuse of why trump isn't taking action okay yeah and he's
[3:07:59.800 --> 3:08:05.640]  you know all of this stuff that we're seeing happening i mean this huge barrage of constitutional
[3:08:05.640 --> 3:08:10.680]  violations against the people of this country the actual threat is all happening on trumps what
[3:08:10.680 --> 3:08:15.240]  that's right they are while we're while we're while we're watching a border wall go up down in in the
[3:08:15.240 --> 3:08:20.440]  south we're also watching people being bused into this country to churches sanctuary cities
[3:08:20.440 --> 3:08:27.640]  etc etc all under trump's watch yeah you know yeah hey i've i've said before go go arrest the unconstitutional
[3:08:27.640 --> 3:08:34.520]  judges go arrest the CEOs of google and facebook and twitter arrest them charge them with violating
[3:08:34.520 --> 3:08:39.480]  civil rights of the american people it's time to do it yeah he's not going to do any of that i know
[3:08:39.480 --> 3:08:43.960]  i think that he's he's a part of it man i think i honestly believe all right the people have put
[3:08:43.960 --> 3:08:51.880]  their hope in this guy man instead of in themselves in their natural you know god given strength and
[3:08:51.880 --> 3:08:59.160]  authority to fight against this evil and if we don't step up as as free men and women to do something
[3:08:59.160 --> 3:09:06.040]  about this never mind trump okay if we don't do it we're done okay well you're you're right on
[3:09:06.040 --> 3:09:09.640]  alan i think your words are right on and yeah we're up we're up here at the front lines we're we've
[3:09:09.640 --> 3:09:15.160]  been taking enemy fire for years we've been censored we've been demonetized the platformed
[3:09:15.160 --> 3:09:19.720]  everything we're fighting for our survival and we sure don't feel like trump is helping us very
[3:09:19.720 --> 3:09:24.360]  much out here in this free speech battlefield right now and i i think i speak for a lot of
[3:09:24.360 --> 3:09:28.680]  people independent media uh we're glad that we didn't we don't have hillary clinton in charge
[3:09:28.680 --> 3:09:34.760]  because we we all would have been in jail by now but president trump man if you don't if you don't
[3:09:34.760 --> 3:09:38.280]  do something you're gonna you're gonna be in jail because that's what the democrats are gonna
[3:09:38.280 --> 3:09:44.680]  push it so thank you for your call alan a very good point let's go to richard in texas talk
[3:09:44.680 --> 3:09:49.320]  some notes about legal action against unrest what do you think richard what's on your mind
[3:09:51.480 --> 3:09:58.280]  hey mike thanks for your work i just wanted to talk about it sounds like you know most of the
[3:09:58.280 --> 3:10:04.680]  listeners they have the information they know what's right what's wrong but let me put this
[3:10:04.680 --> 3:10:13.880]  together for everyone the way politics works is what they call juice so if we don't go out in the
[3:10:13.880 --> 3:10:22.600]  street and confront politicians on video when when when we do things like oh and shorter
[3:10:23.640 --> 3:10:31.160]  confronting jerry nadler in there the the halls of congress yes that creates public favor where
[3:10:31.160 --> 3:10:38.200]  trump has the ability to act so the the way they do this thing in congress is all about public
[3:10:38.200 --> 3:10:46.840]  opinion right so when hundreds and hundreds of people create videos of them uh confronting
[3:10:46.840 --> 3:10:55.480]  politicians with information in a legal and lawful way that gives trump the ability to say uh look
[3:10:55.480 --> 3:11:01.000]  that's great what you're talking about but i got the juice this is literally how to have these
[3:11:01.000 --> 3:11:05.400]  conversations yeah right it gives him the platform to say look look what the people are
[3:11:05.400 --> 3:11:09.000]  demanding out there the people are demanding their free speech i must act that's what you're saying
[3:11:09.880 --> 3:11:16.040]  exactly exactly and so if if every listener doesn't legally and lawfully go out and use
[3:11:16.040 --> 3:11:22.040]  their first amendment they're not gonna have trump stand for the first amendment because it's
[3:11:22.040 --> 3:11:27.960]  politics it's this isn't the kingdom of heaven this is politics this is an evil system it's all
[3:11:27.960 --> 3:11:34.200]  about public opinion and you have to push the public opinion like martin luther king did they
[3:11:34.200 --> 3:11:39.720]  fbi compromise martin luther king but he didn't shut up anyways they said i'm gonna go to jail
[3:11:39.720 --> 3:11:45.720]  i'll do whatever it takes he just wouldn't shut his mouth and if info warriors won't shut their
[3:11:45.720 --> 3:11:52.360]  mouth that will give the president the juice to take action and they won't be able to stop them
[3:11:52.360 --> 3:11:56.600]  you're exactly right all right uh excellent call thank you for your points and this underscores
[3:11:56.600 --> 3:12:04.200]  by the way the the heroism of ova shroyer who will be live by the way uh for for his war room
[3:12:04.200 --> 3:12:09.640]  broadcast at 3 p.m here central time so don't miss oh and he's live today he's in studio today
[3:12:09.640 --> 3:12:16.040]  and he what he did set off a chain reaction of people speaking out in the faces of these corrupt
[3:12:16.040 --> 3:12:21.480]  criminal politicians like uh joe biden and others uh let's go to chris in washington
[3:12:22.920 --> 3:12:27.560]  your the notes here says uh your concern is just the same scenario for 2020 nothing much is
[3:12:27.560 --> 3:12:34.040]  going to change what really give us give us your uh overview here i'm interested well
[3:12:34.040 --> 3:12:40.520]  excuse me man i'm out of breath happy new year i'm out training my knee but uh this is what i
[3:12:40.520 --> 3:12:47.960]  believe we've been hearing the same stuff for probably 20 years and we're being whittled away
[3:12:47.960 --> 3:12:55.000]  more and more and alex has a promo of a guy who's on there so when he's doing one of his
[3:12:55.000 --> 3:13:00.360]  advertising this says enough of the talk and we don't need a politician we need a soldier enough
[3:13:00.360 --> 3:13:09.400]  talk yeah granted emperor wars and people are standing up and god i hope virginia stands call
[3:13:09.400 --> 3:13:16.520]  because if they fall i believe the creed the country's done i think it already is done it's a slow
[3:13:16.520 --> 3:13:23.800]  bleed we've let so much pass there's so much uh traitorism going on openly right in front of
[3:13:23.800 --> 3:13:29.960]  the people and we sit back and do nothing there should be the military should be arresting people
[3:13:29.960 --> 3:13:34.680]  the president should be arresting people i mean they made open threats to the presidency
[3:13:34.680 --> 3:13:40.680]  you know with a madame and that and no nothing's ever done it's just talk talk talk amazing and
[3:13:40.680 --> 3:13:47.000]  tremendous we need a soldier i think you nailed it there chris we need to take decisive tactical
[3:13:47.000 --> 3:13:52.280]  action with the authorization of the president who should invoke the insurrection act right now
[3:13:52.280 --> 3:13:58.360]  and call for the people's support to go out and arrest the traders the traders in congress
[3:13:58.360 --> 3:14:03.400]  the traders in the judicial positions that the traders in the media who are part of this
[3:14:03.400 --> 3:14:07.240]  criminal conspiracy coup against the united states of america and who have committed
[3:14:07.240 --> 3:14:11.560]  criminal acts to try to take this country down a good call chris i think you've absolutely nailed
[3:14:11.560 --> 3:14:17.640]  it got one more caller kathryn from oklahoma says here that trump has a plan and we should
[3:14:17.640 --> 3:14:22.680]  chill out is that is that right is that some good news kathryn what are you what are you thinking
[3:14:22.680 --> 3:14:27.960]  can you chill out can you hear me okay yeah i can hear you go ahead you we're we've got like a minute
[3:14:27.960 --> 3:14:36.600]  and a half go for it okay okay um yes i'd love that the women are calling in there they seem very
[3:14:36.600 --> 3:14:43.800]  insightful and uh what i wanted to say is that it to me is not only about
[3:14:43.800 --> 3:14:53.240]  top and man you guys are warriors so we keep the heart burning we nurture and we need to be more
[3:14:53.240 --> 3:15:01.160]  active it's making it very awkward for me to be a female when all of the women in washington uh
[3:15:01.160 --> 3:15:09.160]  are cuckoo and uh how does this your note was that we need to chill out how does this
[3:15:09.160 --> 3:15:16.760]  uh align with that now i don't think i got that okay maybe maybe that wasn't a good transcription
[3:15:17.480 --> 3:15:28.440]  i believe i said that i think that trump is taking a five-year uh test day and i believe
[3:15:28.440 --> 3:15:34.440]  that he's he's got an ambus that he's going to i'm sorry to interrupt we are having a hard time

[3:19:40.040 --> 3:19:45.640]  so much more enjoyable it's making the shows more focused i've got more energy we have huge sales
[3:19:45.640 --> 3:19:50.200]  going right now for the new year at info wars life dot com a big clearance sale take advantage of it

[3:21:12.040 --> 3:21:20.840]  you use it it's the first day of the year here 2020 you're watching the alex jones show mike
[3:21:20.840 --> 3:21:26.200]  adams filling in for i don't know the next couple of segments here in the fourth hour and we just took
[3:21:26.200 --> 3:21:31.320]  a whole lot of amazing calls the callers were great today and they were very insightful in fact one
[3:21:31.320 --> 3:21:36.440]  of the points that was mentioned by one of the callers is how important it is to be on the streets
[3:21:36.440 --> 3:21:42.920]  legally and peacefully sort of in the faces of those who are enemies of america you know the the
[3:21:42.920 --> 3:21:49.160]  radical left the the fake news so-called journalists were really just cia puppets to get in their face
[3:21:49.160 --> 3:21:56.280]  again peacefully lawfully but film yourself you know screaming the truth at those people when when
[3:21:56.280 --> 3:22:01.560]  it's important to do so like oh and shroyer did again you know we're not talking about attacking
[3:22:01.560 --> 3:22:07.000]  like the radical left we're not saying go antifa on these people that's what lunatic left us do
[3:22:07.000 --> 3:22:13.640]  but we are saying engage them by shouting the truth at them hey joe biden your son got massive
[3:22:13.640 --> 3:22:21.000]  payoffs in a kind of a money laundering scheme that he didn't earn and the foreign aid was funneled
[3:22:21.000 --> 3:22:27.480]  into barisma in ukraine and joe biden's family got a kickback and nancy polosi's family is getting
[3:22:27.480 --> 3:22:31.480]  a kickback in fact they're all on the take they're all crooks and criminals it seems like right so
[3:22:31.480 --> 3:22:38.280]  why not shout that in their faces and every time joe biden is out there doing a i don't know some
[3:22:38.280 --> 3:22:42.920]  kind of event you know challenge them challenge them on these issues and if hillary clinton jumps
[3:22:42.920 --> 3:22:48.440]  in which she's going to by the way i have no doubts about that challenge her hey what about the clinton
[3:22:48.440 --> 3:22:53.960]  body count you know what about all the dead people who had the goods on the clinton's challenge her on
[3:22:53.960 --> 3:22:59.320]  those issues challenge aoc hey you're a lunatic you want to collapse the food supply and lead
[3:22:59.320 --> 3:23:04.520]  to mass starvation across america by banning combustion engines what are you crazy challenge
[3:23:04.520 --> 3:23:09.560]  these people challenge them in public and post the videos if the videos get banned post them on
[3:23:09.560 --> 3:23:14.200]  brighton.com that's why we built it for you so you can have free speech or you know post them on
[3:23:14.200 --> 3:23:20.920]  bitshoot post them places where you can get the videos picked up uh share them with with infowars
[3:23:20.920 --> 3:23:26.280]  do that stuff it's important anyway great calls today a great show overall all day and there's
[3:23:26.280 --> 3:23:31.640]  more here i'm going to get into some mysteries of the universe in this segment i'll probably do
[3:23:31.640 --> 3:23:39.240]  this segment and the next segment today and i gotta say alex specifically asked me because i
[3:23:39.240 --> 3:23:45.160]  i'm a published scientist i run a science lab he asked me to come in and talk about this flat earth
[3:23:45.160 --> 3:23:51.240]  issue because it's becoming more and more popular apparently the the idea that the earth might be
[3:23:51.240 --> 3:23:58.200]  flat is spreading among many people and you know i i've i've watched some of the videos myself
[3:23:58.200 --> 3:24:03.560]  i've seen some of the discussion and of course i will tell you that the earth is a sphere but
[3:24:03.560 --> 3:24:10.200]  i want you to understand why and i it's important that we all learn to to think clearly as we're
[3:24:10.200 --> 3:24:16.840]  trying to navigate the the craziness in our universe but we have to have i think ideas that
[3:24:16.840 --> 3:24:24.280]  are grounded in reality whether we're talking about economics or the politics or the cosmos and so
[3:24:25.160 --> 3:24:29.560]  when people talk about flat earth they're again they're not they're not malicious people they're
[3:24:29.560 --> 3:24:33.800]  they're curious people and they're trying to understand the way the universe works i think
[3:24:33.800 --> 3:24:38.280]  they just reached the wrong conclusions so i'd like to give you some important ideas today
[3:24:38.280 --> 3:24:45.000]  about the way the universe actually works and why the earth is a sphere so that you can answer
[3:24:45.000 --> 3:24:49.480]  these questions if if if a flat earth person is trying to tell you or convince you that the earth
[3:24:49.480 --> 3:24:55.320]  is flat you can you can understand that it's it's not and also at the highest levels of that movement
[3:24:55.320 --> 3:24:59.880]  i think and this is not everybody who's in it but maybe how it was founded originally i think it
[3:24:59.880 --> 3:25:06.360]  was designed to discredit conspiracy analysts who are looking at 9 11 and say hey how do world
[3:25:06.360 --> 3:25:10.760]  trade center seven building how did that building fall well it was controlled demolition why do we
[3:25:10.760 --> 3:25:15.960]  know that because our explanation is consistent with the laws of physics so we actually use science
[3:25:15.960 --> 3:25:22.200]  to understand false flags and domestic operations and the fake science of the vaccine industry we
[3:25:22.200 --> 3:25:26.680]  can prove that it's fake we can prove the vaccines are dangerous we can prove the vaccines kill some
[3:25:26.680 --> 3:25:31.400]  children in fact those numbers are released by the government itself it's under the VAERS system
[3:25:31.400 --> 3:25:37.000]  under health and human services you can download the spreadsheets that have the statistics so everything
[3:25:37.000 --> 3:25:43.080]  that i argue and i believe that when when alex is making similar arguments we are all working to
[3:25:43.080 --> 3:25:48.600]  make these arguments from a place that's consistent with the understanding of cause and effect how
[3:25:48.600 --> 3:25:55.560]  the universe works the scientific reality we don't have to invent a fake system of vaccine science
[3:25:55.560 --> 3:26:01.400]  to attack vaccines we cite the actual published science the the statements that's in the vaccine
[3:26:01.400 --> 3:26:06.680]  inserts themselves they admit these vaccines may have viral shedding for example that the chicken
[3:26:06.680 --> 3:26:12.440]  pox vaccine can cause chicken pox to spread across your entire family they admit these vaccines have
[3:26:12.440 --> 3:26:17.960]  never been tested on pregnant women we don't have to invent an alternate universe to argue against
[3:26:17.960 --> 3:26:24.120]  vaccine safety or to argue about what happened on 9 11 we don't have to invent an alternate universe
[3:26:24.120 --> 3:26:31.880]  or or kind of invoke like a comic book uh physics reality and yet in the flat earth community they
[3:26:31.880 --> 3:26:37.400]  they come up with just totally wild alternate explanations like oh gravity isn't real i've
[3:26:37.400 --> 3:26:43.320]  heard or they say uh no it's all electromagnetism that like tides don't work it's actually water
[3:26:43.320 --> 3:26:48.840]  being pushed by the sun's electric rays or something maybe i'm not quoting them exactly
[3:26:48.840 --> 3:26:54.120]  but i've heard some very bizarre things it's like an alternate universe of physics and that's not
[3:26:54.120 --> 3:26:59.400]  really a legitimate place to argue anything anything from if you're gonna argue about the way the
[3:26:59.400 --> 3:27:03.800]  world works or the way the cosmos works it's important to understand how the laws of physics
[3:27:03.800 --> 3:27:08.120]  actually function so let me give you a few things that are that are really really good
[3:27:08.920 --> 3:27:14.200]  number one a lot of us are long range shooters myself included you know i've got a 338 lapua
[3:27:14.200 --> 3:27:20.840]  magnum rifle and i'll shoot a thousand yards you know to warm up and you can shoot 2000 yards with
[3:27:20.840 --> 3:27:24.680]  those rifles well everybody that's a long range shooter and many of you listening probably are
[3:27:24.680 --> 3:27:30.200]  as well you know that in the ballistic software that you use you know that gives you the holds
[3:27:30.200 --> 3:27:34.520]  how many mils you have to hold the spin drift you know you have to hold to the left to account for
[3:27:34.520 --> 3:27:39.800]  spin drift if it's a right hand turn for barrel twists and so on the ballistics calculators they
[3:27:39.800 --> 3:27:44.920]  all ask you what direction you are shooting are you shooting north or south or east or west
[3:27:44.920 --> 3:27:49.640]  you know why that matters because the earth is spinning and as your bullet flies through the
[3:27:49.640 --> 3:27:55.400]  air the earth is actually spinning underneath your bullet and if you fire north or south your
[3:27:55.400 --> 3:28:00.520]  bullet's going to either appear to bend to the left or the right based on the coriolis effect
[3:28:00.520 --> 3:28:08.200]  of the planet spinning every long range shooter even a swat shooter a military sniper a competition
[3:28:08.200 --> 3:28:12.760]  shooter or just a casual civilian long range shooter like myself we all know that if you
[3:28:12.760 --> 3:28:17.800]  don't account for the spin of the earth for very long range shooting you will miss your target
[3:28:18.440 --> 3:28:23.080]  sometimes by eight inches 10 inches 12 inches depending on on the flight time of the bullet
[3:28:23.080 --> 3:28:27.480]  because the earth is spinning similarly if you shoot to the west or shoot to the east
[3:28:27.480 --> 3:28:32.680]  that also matters too because the earth is spinning west to east so if you shoot to the east
[3:28:32.680 --> 3:28:37.320]  your target is falling away from you and lower and you will end up shooting high if you don't
[3:28:37.320 --> 3:28:41.880]  account for the spin of the earth so long range shooting right there proves that we are living
[3:28:41.880 --> 3:28:47.080]  on a planet that's spherical and that is spinning on its axis and there are many more examples of
[3:28:47.080 --> 3:28:51.880]  this i'll give them to you straight ahead we'll continue here on the alex jones show mike adams

[3:31:58.920 --> 3:32:03.000]  go ahead and talk about the topic on hand i gotta talk about one of your product a little bit about
[3:32:03.000 --> 3:32:09.320]  me i'm 245 pounds i work about 10 to 13 hours a day at ups and make a long story short i used to
[3:32:09.320 --> 3:32:14.840]  have a problem with adderall i do have adhd but you know i was taking adderall for its energy
[3:32:14.840 --> 3:32:18.040]  boosting properties you know i kind of got a little out of hand and you know i listen you
[3:32:18.040 --> 3:32:23.480]  religiously in my truck every day so i tried your turbo force and really it's a cliche this product
[3:32:23.480 --> 3:32:27.960]  changed my life but turbo force really changed my life and he was there no longer take adderall
[3:32:27.960 --> 3:32:33.880]  and i get by literally the 13 hours a day i work on a half of a packet of your turbo force and if
[3:32:33.880 --> 3:32:38.200]  you take a half a packet that's literally a dollar a day and you save so much money versus you know
[3:32:38.200 --> 3:32:43.080]  a monster which is what 499 and i you know i just had to call and tell you guys uh how great turbo
[3:32:43.080 --> 3:32:46.760]  forces and if anybody's on the fence they really have to try it we're really proud of turbo force
[3:32:46.760 --> 3:32:50.920]  so thank you sir commit to buy a lot of your products at m4store.com then help us spread the word
[3:32:50.920 --> 3:32:59.160]  let's just get busy m4store.com you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:32:59.160 --> 3:33:14.200]  leading a frontal assault on the lives of the new world order it's alex jones with mike adams
[3:33:17.400 --> 3:33:23.080]  i think it's it's important you know we're talking about flat earth theory and the nature of the
[3:33:23.080 --> 3:33:27.640]  cosmos and and as much as i appreciate people asking big questions and questioning the official
[3:33:27.640 --> 3:33:31.880]  narratives and it's true that nasa has lied about a great many things over the years i think it's
[3:33:31.880 --> 3:33:35.960]  important to be able to distinguish between uh you know what's what's real in the physical
[3:33:35.960 --> 3:33:41.640]  universe versus something that's just a thought experiment or a theory and i don't mean i don't
[3:33:41.640 --> 3:33:47.720]  mean to be offensive by this but from the outside perspective i want those of you who might be
[3:33:47.720 --> 3:33:52.840]  following flatter theory i want you to know that the way that we think of people who believe in
[3:33:52.840 --> 3:33:58.360]  transgenderism where they say oh a man can become a woman we're saying we say you're nuts that's
[3:33:58.360 --> 3:34:03.640]  crazy that's magical thinking a man can't become a woman a man can't get pregnant that's the way
[3:34:03.640 --> 3:34:10.760]  other people think of flat earthers who say that the earth is flat that to to to most people it
[3:34:10.760 --> 3:34:15.640]  sounds like the way that it sounds to us when people say men can become women just just letting
[3:34:15.640 --> 3:34:19.320]  you know that that's what it sounds like and and part of that i think is an effort to discredit
[3:34:19.320 --> 3:34:25.160]  it legitimate conspiracy analysis you know if you're questioning what happened at oklahoma city
[3:34:25.160 --> 3:34:30.600]  for example you know was the fbi involved in that bomb actually they were you know that it was a
[3:34:30.600 --> 3:34:36.600]  whole fbi operation and timothy mcvay was just the fall guy for it but what they want to be able to
[3:34:36.600 --> 3:34:41.560]  say the critics of all that is to say oh gosh well this person they think oklahoma city was a
[3:34:41.560 --> 3:34:45.960]  false flag they think 9 11 was a false flag and they think the earth is flat and right there what
[3:34:45.960 --> 3:34:51.160]  that does is it just gives you know critics or the media immediate ammunition to say well they
[3:34:51.160 --> 3:34:55.400]  must be crazy they think they think the earth is flat especially since the earth isn't flat by the
[3:34:55.400 --> 3:35:04.280]  way so if it's especially important that we allow our our analysis to be led by logic and the evidence
[3:35:04.280 --> 3:35:10.120]  so there is evidence that the fbi has been running false flag operations i mean i can cite from you
[3:35:10.120 --> 3:35:16.840]  a new york times story about the fbi running most terror plots in america and then recruiting people
[3:35:16.840 --> 3:35:20.360]  to carry them out and then stopping them at the last minute that's been covered by the kansas
[3:35:20.360 --> 3:35:23.800]  city star that's been covered by the new york times in fact i think the writer for the kansas
[3:35:23.800 --> 3:35:29.240]  city star was ian comings if i'm not uh mistaken the fbi runs terror plots that's that's a fact
[3:35:29.800 --> 3:35:36.440]  that's not conspiracy that's an analysis of reality so as we do this it's important to have
[3:35:36.440 --> 3:35:41.560]  credibility in what we're arguing so let me give you some more facts or some some more physics
[3:35:41.560 --> 3:35:46.680]  experiments that you can run yourself to know that the earth is not flat in case someone is trying
[3:35:46.680 --> 3:35:52.200]  to convince you that it is one is that of course flatter theory requires that there are no satellites
[3:35:53.000 --> 3:35:58.680]  and so you might wonder how do satellite dishes work if the earth is flat and there are no no
[3:35:58.680 --> 3:36:04.360]  satellites so obviously satellite dishes do function and what you can do i've heard i think
[3:36:04.360 --> 3:36:11.720]  some flatter theorists say that satellites are receiving they say ground signals somewhere
[3:36:11.720 --> 3:36:16.760]  but what you can do is you can go out to your satellite dish maybe you're getting tv channels
[3:36:16.760 --> 3:36:21.480]  are you getting banned with via satellite and you can take that dish if you dare and you can just
[3:36:21.480 --> 3:36:25.800]  change the angle of that dish like 20 degrees and what's going to happen is that dish is no
[3:36:25.800 --> 3:36:30.920]  longer going to point at the satellite in the sky in a geostationary orbit that's communicating
[3:36:30.920 --> 3:36:34.920]  with your dish and you're going to lose your satellite tv you're going to lose your bandwidth
[3:36:35.640 --> 3:36:38.760]  and you're going to have to call somebody to come out and re-aim the dish well why does the
[3:36:38.760 --> 3:36:44.440]  dish aim matter and the reason is because there's a satellite out there orbiting the planet and it's
[3:36:44.440 --> 3:36:49.880]  orbiting the planet at a distance that allows its orbit to have the same frequency as earth's axis
[3:36:49.880 --> 3:36:54.440]  spinning so that the satellite appears to be in a geostationary orbit in other words it doesn't
[3:36:54.440 --> 3:36:59.800]  move relative to the fixed outer surface of the earth's sphere itself the satellite appears to
[3:36:59.800 --> 3:37:04.120]  be in a fixed position in the sky there's a certain distance from the planet at which that orbit
[3:37:04.120 --> 3:37:09.400]  can be achieved i think it's 22,500 miles or something close to that it's pretty far out there
[3:37:09.400 --> 3:37:14.680]  which is why there's latency in your satellite dish communications that's why you know there's
[3:37:14.680 --> 3:37:18.920]  over one second latency because that's the speed of the electromagnetic spectrum moving
[3:37:18.920 --> 3:37:23.400]  to that geostationary satellite so anyway this is something you can test yourself you can go out
[3:37:23.400 --> 3:37:27.720]  you can move your satellite dish or you can take an aluminum trash can lid and just cover your
[3:37:27.720 --> 3:37:34.280]  satellite dish and guess what your bandwidth will cease because that satellite dish is actually
[3:37:34.280 --> 3:37:38.360]  talking to a satellite and there are satellites in orbit around the earth and if there weren't how
[3:37:38.360 --> 3:37:44.920]  does GPS work how does GPS how do you get GPS signals believe me there are satellites many
[3:37:44.920 --> 3:37:51.640]  satellites in in orbit another thing that's obvious in all this you can buy a digital gyroscope and if
[3:37:51.640 --> 3:37:58.360]  you have a gyroscope sitting on your desk it will show a drift of 15 degrees per hour why
[3:37:58.360 --> 3:38:03.880]  why is it drifting 15 degrees per hour well because the planet is rotating 360 degrees
[3:38:03.880 --> 3:38:09.400]  in 24 hours and if you have a gyroscope and i think i think the flat some flat earth group bought
[3:38:09.400 --> 3:38:14.840]  a very high-end digital gyroscope to test this and they couldn't figure out why they had to recalibrate
[3:38:14.840 --> 3:38:20.120]  it every hour because it kept drifting 15 degrees every hour actually what they're doing is proving
[3:38:20.120 --> 3:38:25.640]  that the earth is rotating underneath the gyroscope and so that's something you can do you can buy
[3:38:25.640 --> 3:38:29.720]  even low-cost gyroscopes that plug into your cell phones and so on and you can you can watch them
[3:38:29.720 --> 3:38:35.960]  they'll drift 15 degrees per hour similar thing there are museums where you can get you can see
[3:38:35.960 --> 3:38:41.800]  pendulums that are swinging they're like multiple stories tall like a three-story tall cable and
[3:38:41.800 --> 3:38:46.680]  a pendulum swinging back and forth in a museum i saw one myself i think it was in chicago or
[3:38:46.680 --> 3:38:53.960]  detroit a few years ago and what happens is as the earth rotates underneath that pendulum the axis
[3:38:53.960 --> 3:39:00.120]  on which the pendulum swings will appear to shift and rotate around the 360 degrees this is because
[3:39:00.120 --> 3:39:04.520]  the earth is spinning underneath the pendulum and in fact this these experiments have been carried
[3:39:04.520 --> 3:39:10.040]  out for hundreds of years it was one of the first proofs that the earth was rotating that the earth
[3:39:10.040 --> 3:39:14.680]  was a sphere and it's also what's interesting is the the speed of the rotation of the pendulum
[3:39:14.680 --> 3:39:20.840]  axis depends on the latitude of the location of that pendulum relative to the equator which is
[3:39:21.720 --> 3:39:25.560]  actually makes perfect sense when you can when you consider the angular momentum
[3:39:25.560 --> 3:39:29.480]  and how it varies based on your distance from the equator because you're you're you're spinning the
[3:39:29.480 --> 3:39:34.920]  fastest at the equator and you're spinning not quite not quite as fast when you're in a more
[3:39:34.920 --> 3:39:40.680]  northern latitude or a southern latitude because the circle that you're making is is smaller anyway
[3:39:40.680 --> 3:39:44.840]  you can look up pendulums in science and and the spherical earth and so on you can go see these
[3:39:44.840 --> 3:39:49.800]  pendulums yourself believe me they're not faked i've seen them with my own eyes i've also flown
[3:39:49.800 --> 3:39:56.280]  in in jets in the co-pilot seat i'm i'm a trained pilot uh checked out in sesna not not jets but i
[3:39:56.280 --> 3:40:02.120]  was lucky enough to to sit in the co-pilot seat of a private jet at one point and you can see the
[3:40:02.120 --> 3:40:06.840]  curvature of the earth out in front of you and i've heard flat earthers say that when you're a
[3:40:06.840 --> 3:40:11.800]  passenger in a jet and you're looking out the window and the earth looks curved they say well
[3:40:11.800 --> 3:40:16.520]  that's because the window is kind of a lens because the windows are thick the plexiglass
[3:40:16.520 --> 3:40:21.800]  is curved and it creates the illusion of a curved earth well i'm here to tell you if you sit in the
[3:40:21.800 --> 3:40:30.360]  pilot seat of of a jet uh there is no distortion in in the cockpit glass the you know the plexiglass
[3:40:30.360 --> 3:40:34.520]  the windows it's designed to give you clarity otherwise pilots would be running into each other
[3:40:34.520 --> 3:40:38.680]  all over the tarmac you know if there were distortions in that you get a clear view of what
[3:40:38.680 --> 3:40:41.800]  you're seeing otherwise you couldn't fly and when you're sitting up there in the front of the
[3:40:41.800 --> 3:40:45.960]  airplane and there are you know thousands of pilots around the world who can testify to this
[3:40:45.960 --> 3:40:50.360]  you get up to a high enough altitude above 39 000 feet typically you can really start to see the
[3:40:50.360 --> 3:40:57.640]  curvature of the earth it's not fabricated it's physics and also you know i've got a large list
[3:40:57.640 --> 3:41:02.040]  of different ideas here for example you live in the northern hemisphere maybe you have a friend
[3:41:02.040 --> 3:41:06.200]  who lives in the southern hemisphere you call your friend guess what they will see different
[3:41:06.200 --> 3:41:12.120]  stars than you see you're looking at you know the northern hemisphere stars they're looking at the
[3:41:12.120 --> 3:41:17.080]  southern cross well why is that how can that be if the earth is flat wouldn't we all be looking at
[3:41:17.080 --> 3:41:21.400]  the same stars if the earth was flat we would we have the same sky but we don't we have different
[3:41:21.400 --> 3:41:27.800]  skies and there's so many examples of this for example the kind of eclipse where the sun shines
[3:41:27.800 --> 3:41:32.680]  light and the earth casts a shadow on the moon covers up the whole moon the moon turns dark
[3:41:32.680 --> 3:41:37.240]  because of the shadow of the earth what's the shape of that shadow it's circular it's it's
[3:41:37.240 --> 3:41:44.040]  spherical and and the moon itself the shadow when light is cast on it from the side is spherical so
[3:41:45.080 --> 3:41:51.080]  if the flatter theory says that the sun and the moon are on the same side of the earth so how could
[3:41:51.080 --> 3:41:55.400]  the sun cast a shadow of the earth on the moon unless the sun was on the opposite side of the
[3:41:55.400 --> 3:42:01.800]  planet you see so there are a thousand different ways that you can obviously point out that the
[3:42:01.800 --> 3:42:06.360]  earth is not flat the earth is a sphere there are satellites that orbit the earth the moon is one
[3:42:06.360 --> 3:42:12.040]  of those satellites and by the way the moon is the same size no matter where it is which means
[3:42:12.040 --> 3:42:17.800]  it's roughly the same distance from the earth flat earth theory says that the moon is close to you
[3:42:17.800 --> 3:42:21.480]  when it's directly above you and then it's farther away from you when it goes to the horizon and
[3:42:21.480 --> 3:42:25.800]  appears to disappear but that's not true you can take a rifle scope and you can look at the moon
[3:42:25.800 --> 3:42:29.640]  and you can count the number of mills that is the width of the moon and it's the same
[3:42:29.640 --> 3:42:33.640]  at any time of the night whether the moon's on the horizon or up in the sky the moon is always
[3:42:33.640 --> 3:42:38.040]  roughly the same distance from the earth and you can prove that with a rifle scope so there are
[3:42:38.040 --> 3:42:43.000]  all kinds of ways that you can tell the earth is a sphere so flat earth theory kind of doesn't
[3:42:43.000 --> 3:42:49.320]  really check out but it's an interesting idea just thought reality we'll be back with one more final
[3:42:49.320 --> 3:43:04.760]  thought see with it well here we are in the year 2020 and old friends are not forgotten
[3:43:04.760 --> 3:43:09.720]  you the patriots that have kept him for wars on the air thank you so much i don't want the globalist

[3:44:50.360 --> 3:44:59.480]  infowarstore.com a little less than four months ago i made the announcement on air i said hey
[3:45:00.200 --> 3:45:06.120]  i have a tendency to take the high quality supplements from fourslife for a while get great
[3:45:06.120 --> 3:45:11.640]  results and then slowly i stop using them i forget to religiously take them i'm going to
[3:45:11.640 --> 3:45:18.040]  religiously take the supplements for the next few months and i've lost almost 40 pounds now
[3:45:18.040 --> 3:45:24.360]  everybody can see it on air my energy is off the charts everything is amazing and it's because i am
[3:45:24.360 --> 3:45:30.840]  taking the info wars life products the krill oil i'm taking the x2 and the x3 i'm taking the brain
[3:45:30.840 --> 3:45:36.120]  force plus when i work out when i have to work really late i'm taking half a pack of turbo force
[3:45:36.120 --> 3:45:42.760]  it is clean energy it is really making my whole life so much more enjoyable it's making the shows
[3:45:42.760 --> 3:45:47.720]  more focused i've got more energy we have huge sales going right now for the new year at info
[3:45:47.720 --> 3:45:55.160]  warslife.com a big clearance sale take advantage of it all at info warslife.com it was about three
[3:45:55.160 --> 3:45:59.960]  and a half months ago and i said on air i'm going to religiously take my supplements i'd always
[3:45:59.960 --> 3:46:04.440]  take them in the past but i forget like everybody else to stay on the regiment well i've done it
[3:46:04.440 --> 3:46:10.920]  and i've lost 39 pounds in less than four months and my life is so amazing and i still have cake
[3:46:10.920 --> 3:46:17.400]  and ice cream and pie just like i did before i'm exercising the same amount but my body has
[3:46:17.400 --> 3:46:23.320]  the trace elements and the key things it needs like the clean iodine x2 and x3 and i take a good
[3:46:23.320 --> 3:46:28.200]  energy booster like turbo force and brain force for my brain and i take the fish oil and i take
[3:46:28.200 --> 3:46:32.280]  the turmeric and i take the knockout and i use the good toothpaste it's fluoride free that's got the

[3:46:52.440 --> 3:47:03.160]  warslife.com you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:47:14.760 --> 3:47:18.680]  all right final segment today fourth hour here on the alex jones show hey i want to mention
[3:47:18.680 --> 3:47:24.200]  by the way there's a petition out there for president trump to pardon roger stone and i'd
[3:47:24.200 --> 3:47:28.760]  like to encourage you to sign that petition go find it i think it's a white house petition
[3:47:28.760 --> 3:47:35.480]  please sign that petition roger stone has been just maliciously smeared and inappropriately
[3:47:36.040 --> 3:47:40.120]  charged with so-called crimes that are just basically fabricated just a result of the deep
[3:47:40.120 --> 3:47:46.520]  state targeting all trump supporters roger stone does not deserve to go to prison roger stone didn't
[3:47:46.520 --> 3:47:51.880]  do anything wrong as the meme says so please sign that petition now at the same time julien assange
[3:47:51.880 --> 3:47:58.120]  is being killed by the globalist deep state and he doesn't deserve that either julien assange
[3:47:58.120 --> 3:48:04.840]  is a hero of human freedom and i support julien assange and his free speech efforts his real
[3:48:04.840 --> 3:48:11.800]  journalism real investigative journalism and he of course embarrassed the deep state he embarrassed
[3:48:11.800 --> 3:48:16.520]  the wrong people and when you embarrass them they want you dead and they'll find ways to kill you
[3:48:17.080 --> 3:48:21.000]  if they can get away with it and they are killing julien assange so please support our efforts in
[3:48:21.000 --> 3:48:28.440]  this new year 2020 to help free julien assange and free roger stone but more importantly let's
[3:48:28.440 --> 3:48:34.280]  defeat the entire deep state criminal cabal system that puts these people behind bars and tortures
[3:48:34.280 --> 3:48:40.280]  them i think julien assange is being subjected to torture and it's gone on for many many years
[3:48:40.280 --> 3:48:45.720]  and it is inhumane and it is unacceptable that is taking place in our world today and they will
[3:48:45.720 --> 3:48:50.840]  try to torture roger stone there are others uh they're they're going after root is juliani
[3:48:50.840 --> 3:48:55.160]  now too and they'll they'll throw trump in in prison if they get the chance so defeating the
[3:48:55.160 --> 3:49:00.760]  deep state system is the key to all of this we've got a lot of work to do this year i've got one
[3:49:00.760 --> 3:49:05.560]  more interesting topic for you here in this final segment today and alex asked me to come on talk about
[3:49:05.560 --> 3:49:12.760]  some of these things and i said yeah i'm happy to uh 100 stars have vanished from the sky according to
[3:49:12.760 --> 3:49:19.160]  new research they've been comparing the astronomy photographs of the sky from 50 years ago to today
[3:49:19.160 --> 3:49:24.760]  and they found 100 stars have vanished now of course given the speed of light it means those
[3:49:24.760 --> 3:49:29.560]  stars actually vanished perhaps thousands of years ago or even tens of thousands of years ago
[3:49:29.560 --> 3:49:35.560]  the diameter of the milky way is about 120 000 light years so it would take light of course 120 000
[3:49:35.560 --> 3:49:41.560]  years to traverse the full diameter of the spiral arms but these stars might be anywhere in the
[3:49:41.560 --> 3:49:47.560]  milky way or potentially they could be they could look like stars but actually be other other galaxies
[3:49:47.560 --> 3:49:52.520]  that have vanished but something's vanishing out there in the sky lots of stars statistically
[3:49:52.520 --> 3:49:57.240]  this should not be happening so this is baffling scientists and in fact the authors of this particular
[3:49:57.240 --> 3:50:01.720]  study said that they they had no explanation but they thought it must be some natural explanation
[3:50:02.600 --> 3:50:07.000]  i want to offer you today something a little outside the box and you might agree you might
[3:50:07.000 --> 3:50:12.600]  disagree that's fine i encourage you to think but there is another explanation for all of this and
[3:50:12.600 --> 3:50:18.360]  that is that non-earth civilizations are harvesting stars using what are called dyson spheres and
[3:50:18.360 --> 3:50:22.760]  this is actually mainstream science believe it or not there are scientists working with that
[3:50:22.760 --> 3:50:29.720]  nasa on new propulsion systems that use antimatter fuel to bend spacetime creating like a warp
[3:50:29.720 --> 3:50:35.640]  bubble around a ship so that that ship can travel faster than the speed of light or appear to it's
[3:50:35.640 --> 3:50:41.000]  bending space is not actually exceeding the speed of light in normal space it's bending space and
[3:50:41.000 --> 3:50:47.080]  then moving through that bent space achieving apparent speeds faster than the speed of light
[3:50:47.080 --> 3:50:51.960]  but to do this requires a tremendous amount of energy energy that must be projected essentially
[3:50:51.960 --> 3:50:56.680]  you're distorting gravity you're distorting spacetime and this is something that's being
[3:50:56.680 --> 3:51:01.880]  talked about even by mainstream scientists nasa again is researching this and this technology
[3:51:02.760 --> 3:51:07.160]  will come into existence on earth within the next 50 to 60 years according to mainstream
[3:51:07.160 --> 3:51:13.640]  scientists and just takes a little over one gram of antimatter to propel a ship from earth to jupiter
[3:51:14.920 --> 3:51:20.120]  yeah i mean antimatter is very potent fuel and of course there's research ongoing
[3:51:20.120 --> 3:51:23.480]  there are you can create antimatter right here on earth they've done it they've
[3:51:23.480 --> 3:51:26.600]  created small amounts of antimatter it takes an enormous amount of energy
[3:51:26.600 --> 3:51:30.360]  that actually takes a billion times more energy to go into it than is released by it
[3:51:30.920 --> 3:51:35.320]  but the military wants it for a weapon system nasa wants it as a propulsion system
[3:51:35.320 --> 3:51:40.120]  to allow humanity to travel to the stars but if you had a non-earth civilization that was millions
[3:51:40.120 --> 3:51:46.440]  of years more advanced than we were what would be their energy source would they burn coal no
[3:51:46.440 --> 3:51:53.160]  would they use windmills no they would harvest stars they would harvest quasars and pulsars
[3:51:53.160 --> 3:51:58.200]  and magnetars and maybe even black holes which are collapsed stars it would harvest stars because
[3:51:58.200 --> 3:52:03.240]  that's an obvious source of energy it's like oil wells spread around the cosmos and i think we need
[3:52:03.240 --> 3:52:07.000]  to consider the possibility that these stars are disappearing because they are being consumed
[3:52:07.560 --> 3:52:12.600]  they're being turned into antimatter fuel by civilizations that are millions of years more
[3:52:12.600 --> 3:52:18.040]  advanced than we are the drake equation mainstream science yet again how many other intelligent
[3:52:18.040 --> 3:52:23.400]  civilizations are there in our milky way galaxy alone not even to consider other galaxies hundreds
[3:52:23.400 --> 3:52:27.720]  of billions of stars in our galaxy according to the drake equation that means there must be
[3:52:27.720 --> 3:52:33.240]  tens of thousands of intelligent civilizations and by the way as a tangent is 2020 the year that
[3:52:33.240 --> 3:52:40.360]  there will be disclosure i mean the navy has been opened out now about uh contact with craft
[3:52:40.360 --> 3:52:48.600]  caught on video in in military planes craft that maneuver in ways that are impossible using human
[3:52:48.600 --> 3:52:55.240]  technology but those maneuvers are entirely possible using space distortion systems gravity
[3:52:55.240 --> 3:53:01.560]  projection systems using antimatter fuel that fuel can be made by harvesting stars so is it
[3:53:01.560 --> 3:53:06.200]  possible and i'm just asking what if i'm not saying for certain this is exactly what's happening
[3:53:06.200 --> 3:53:10.760]  perhaps there's another explanation but is it also possible that stars are being harvested
[3:53:10.760 --> 3:53:16.040]  because there are non-earth civilizations out there that have very advanced technology that
[3:53:16.040 --> 3:53:21.480]  are moving it faster than the speed of light that are colonizing our galaxy and perhaps other
[3:53:21.480 --> 3:53:26.040]  galaxies i think this is the year we need to seriously consider that because there's been
[3:53:26.040 --> 3:53:31.320]  a lot of talk about hey is this the year that trump's going to tell the truth about area 51
[3:53:31.320 --> 3:53:37.240]  or disclose the truth about free energy technology that one caller talked about
[3:53:37.240 --> 3:53:41.720]  in the last hour is this the year that we're going to learn some secrets that can
[3:53:41.720 --> 3:53:47.240]  finally empower and uplift humanity because the nature of the cosmos is far greater than
[3:53:47.240 --> 3:53:52.440]  what any of us have been told information has been withheld from us and google is now in the
[3:53:52.440 --> 3:53:56.760]  business of withholding information from humanity google is all about suppressing human knowledge
[3:53:56.760 --> 3:54:02.840]  rather than setting us free with knowledge so we're living in a world where we are essentially
[3:54:03.400 --> 3:54:10.360]  slaves in a prison camp of disinformation propaganda and forced ignorance meanwhile the
[3:54:10.360 --> 3:54:16.600]  answers to everything that we want to know about god about the universe about the nature of reality
[3:54:16.600 --> 3:54:21.480]  the answers are out there the energy sources are out there but we're being denied access to them
[3:54:21.480 --> 3:54:24.680]  heck they won't even let us learn the truth about vaccines you think they want us to discover the
[3:54:24.680 --> 3:54:33.960]  truth about exotic alien technology that has been copied from recovered spacecraft that earth
[3:54:33.960 --> 3:54:39.000]  scientists have been working on for decades using exotic fuel systems you think they want us to
[3:54:39.000 --> 3:54:46.040]  learn the truth about that no of course not they want to use information scarcity to control this
[3:54:46.040 --> 3:54:50.600]  but they don't want humanity to be set free but if you just look at the stars if you just look up
[3:54:50.600 --> 3:54:55.560]  at the stars you can start to see physical evidence that something's changing out there something's
[3:54:55.560 --> 3:55:02.840]  going on the universe has more mysteries than we're being allowed to even ask about and that's
[3:55:02.840 --> 3:55:06.840]  the point of this story is not to say hey stars are disappearing what's going on what's what's
[3:55:06.840 --> 3:55:13.080]  happened with these stars could there be non-earth entities harvesting them yeah maybe but how could
[3:55:13.080 --> 3:55:20.040]  we be the only living creatures in this entire cosmos how could we be a universe created by
[3:55:20.040 --> 3:55:25.720]  god wouldn't god want to populate the whole universe with life wouldn't there be life all over the
[3:55:25.720 --> 3:55:32.120]  place in fact nasa found life on mars or at least evidence of microbial life in 1976 the viking
[3:55:32.120 --> 3:55:39.880]  lander they covered it up it was a mass spec experiment it proved that microbial metabolism
[3:55:39.880 --> 3:55:45.800]  was taking place in martian soil samples and have you noticed ever since 1976 when they covered that
[3:55:45.800 --> 3:55:52.200]  up they have never sent another mission to mars to look for life instead they've been looking at
[3:55:52.920 --> 3:56:00.360]  well geography and geology they've been looking at human habitation and colonization of mars
[3:56:00.360 --> 3:56:05.640]  but they never sent another experiment to look for microbial life you know why because they already
[3:56:05.640 --> 3:56:09.800]  found it and they don't want more proof that it exists because it's all about covering it up
[3:56:10.360 --> 3:56:13.400]  they don't want you to know life exists on mars they don't want you to know life exists in the
[3:56:13.400 --> 3:56:19.960]  universe they don't want you to know that we are not alone and by the way in a much bigger sense
[3:56:20.840 --> 3:56:28.680]  this entire universe was created by intelligent design this universe was designed to support life
[3:56:29.400 --> 3:56:37.000]  the laws of physics were built and engineered by an intelligent being to support the cosmos
[3:56:37.000 --> 3:56:44.760]  that we now inhabit we are it's intended for us to be aware and alert and alive and awake
[3:56:45.880 --> 3:56:51.800]  it's intended for us to discover more life and more knowledge and the forces holding us back
[3:56:51.800 --> 3:56:57.080]  are the forces of evil like the tech giants like the radical left-wing democrats that murder human
[3:56:57.080 --> 3:57:02.280]  babies the forces of evil the satanism the demonism that tries to destroy life and destroy
[3:57:02.280 --> 3:57:07.800]  abundance and destroy knowledge and destroy even the continuation of the human species by attacking
[3:57:07.800 --> 3:57:12.200]  families and attacking male fertility and attacking the very definition of a family
[3:57:13.720 --> 3:57:18.120]  the answers are out there folks you're not going to get the answers from mainstream media you can
[3:57:18.120 --> 3:57:24.520]  only get them from places like this info wars.com and i'm happy to be here to help explore this
[3:57:24.520 --> 3:57:29.800]  with you and share these ideas with you because together we have a lot to learn and humanity
[3:57:29.800 --> 3:57:34.200]  can go very far if we can defeat the forces of destruction and ignorance that are trying to
[3:57:34.200 --> 3:57:39.400]  bring us down we'll do that all year here at info wars.com i'm mike adams thanks for watching have
[3:57:39.400 --> 3:58:01.400]  a great year you
