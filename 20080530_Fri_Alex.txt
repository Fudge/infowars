[00:00.000 --> 00:05.000]  government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[00:05.000 --> 00:09.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:09.000 --> 00:33.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:33.000 --> 00:36.000]  We've got a really big broadcast lined up for you today.
[00:36.000 --> 00:40.000]  We're going to talk about some of the guests that are coming up in a few minutes.
[00:40.000 --> 00:46.000]  In the meantime, I do want to let you know that I am going to Virginia next Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday,
[00:46.000 --> 00:50.000]  and coming back on Sunday. We'll be in Chantilly right outside the district of criminals.
[00:50.000 --> 00:56.000]  We'll be covering Bilderberg 2008 for you there.
[00:56.000 --> 00:58.000]  And we'll hope to see everybody out there as well.
[00:58.000 --> 01:02.000]  We'll be posting over the weekend maps, locations.
[01:02.000 --> 01:05.000]  I mean, that's already up there in some stories we've written in the last two weeks.
[01:05.000 --> 01:09.000]  But we'll give everybody the exact details and where we're going to be at so that you can come out,
[01:09.000 --> 01:15.000]  demonstrate, engage in the First Amendment as free citizen press, whatever you'd like to cover,
[01:15.000 --> 01:20.000]  the global elite coming into the United States and setting policy.
[01:20.000 --> 01:26.000]  First thing I want to do right now is air this little three-minute CNN piece where they attempt to whitewash.
[01:26.000 --> 01:31.000]  They don't deny that the United States government created HIV.
[01:31.000 --> 01:36.000]  And when I say the United States government, the criminal government that sits atop our government and controls it,
[01:36.000 --> 01:41.000]  the parasite that sits in our central nervous system controlling the levers,
[01:41.000 --> 01:48.000]  they just try to mix it in with some other issues that they claim can't be completely proven.
[01:48.000 --> 01:53.000]  And the fact that they can't deny it is because there is so much evidence, so many admissions,
[01:53.000 --> 02:00.000]  so many Nobel Prize winners and top scientists and documents that when you look at it, it is horrifying.
[02:00.000 --> 02:05.000]  The question is, do you have the courage to admit psychopathic murderers,
[02:05.000 --> 02:10.000]  genius scientists run the planet for a handful of banking families
[02:10.000 --> 02:16.000]  and are waging biological warfare, chemical warfare on all of us right now.
[02:16.000 --> 02:22.000]  Then acting cool and primping or going to church for social reasons
[02:22.000 --> 02:27.000]  or all these little political things we do don't matter as much anymore, do they?
[02:27.000 --> 02:33.000]  Your precious local baseball team doesn't matter as much when you realize that we have psychopaths running our lives
[02:33.000 --> 02:36.000]  and it needs to change because things are about to get even worse.
[02:36.000 --> 02:37.000]  Let's go ahead and go to that clip.
[02:37.000 --> 02:41.000]  Reverend Jeremiah Wright has his theories and he's sticking to them.
[02:41.000 --> 02:43.000]  Take this assertion from a few years ago.
[02:43.000 --> 02:51.000]  The government lied about inventing the HIV virus as a means of genocide against people of color.
[02:51.000 --> 02:52.000]  Government lied.
[02:52.000 --> 02:57.000]  Now, under the glare that's gotten Barack Obama into such a deep political dilemma,
[02:57.000 --> 03:00.000]  Reverend Wright is asked, do you really believe that?
[03:00.000 --> 03:04.000]  Have you read Horowitz's book, Emerging Viruses, AIDS and Ebola?
[03:04.000 --> 03:07.000]  In the 1996 book, Emerging Viruses,
[03:07.000 --> 03:13.000]  Dr. Leonard Horowitz wrote that HIV was introduced to gay men in New York and blacks in Central Africa
[03:13.000 --> 03:17.000]  by a U.S. government-sponsored hepatitis B vaccine,
[03:17.000 --> 03:22.000]  a program of genocide Horowitz claims designed to reduce the world's population.
[03:22.000 --> 03:25.000]  The author is grateful for Reverend Wright's acknowledgment.
[03:25.000 --> 03:35.000]  He's simply doing a godly service and a public service by pointing out the truth that has been heavily suppressed
[03:35.000 --> 03:40.000]  by government officials as well as, unfortunately, the mainstream media.
[03:40.000 --> 03:45.000]  Horowitz claims the Centers for Disease Control came up with one of the strains of the vaccine
[03:45.000 --> 03:47.000]  and then helped cover the scheme up.
[03:47.000 --> 03:51.000]  Contacted by CNN, a CDC official points to government-sponsored research
[03:51.000 --> 03:57.000]  that identifies a subspecies of chimpanzees in Western Africa as the original source of HIV.
[03:57.000 --> 04:01.000]  This is a widely held theory among medical researchers.
[04:01.000 --> 04:05.000]  But Reverend Wright cites another book that has more historical support.
[04:05.000 --> 04:07.000]  Have you read Medical Apartheid?
[04:07.000 --> 04:11.000]  Based on the Tuskegee experiment and based on what has happened to Africans in this country,
[04:11.000 --> 04:14.000]  I believe our government is capable of doing anything.
[04:14.000 --> 04:21.000]  The Tuskegee experiment was a government-sponsored program started in the 1930s to examine the spread of syphilis.
[04:21.000 --> 04:25.000]  Men who already had it were not told and a cure was withheld from them.
[04:25.000 --> 04:29.000]  President Bill Clinton apologized for the program in 1997.
[04:29.000 --> 04:32.000]  Reverend Wright also supports a theory from one researcher
[04:32.000 --> 04:36.000]  on how white and African-American children have different ways of learning and thinking.
[04:36.000 --> 04:38.000]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[04:38.000 --> 04:42.000]  So then they mix in some educational theory or brain theory
[04:42.000 --> 04:46.000]  in different groups of homo sapiens sapiens.
[04:46.000 --> 04:48.000]  There's nothing to do with it.
[04:48.000 --> 05:13.000]  It's just disgusting. You're a pack of murdering scum.
[05:20.000 --> 05:23.000]  And here's the best part. It's 100% legal.
[05:23.000 --> 05:26.000]  And it works at home, the office, or even in other countries
[05:26.000 --> 05:29.000]  to grab television channels and video feeds at your command.

[08:01.000 --> 08:05.000]  But Reverend Wright cites another book that has more historical support.
[08:05.000 --> 08:09.000]  Have you read Medical Apartheid? Based on this Tuskegee experiment
[08:09.000 --> 08:12.000]  and based on what has happened to Africans in this country,
[08:12.000 --> 08:14.000]  I believe our government is capable of doing anything.
[08:14.000 --> 08:17.000]  The Tuskegee experiment was a government-sponsored program
[08:17.000 --> 08:20.000]  started in the 1930s to examine the spread of syphilis.
[08:20.000 --> 08:25.000]  Men who already had it were not told and a cure was withheld from them.
[08:25.000 --> 08:29.000]  President Bill Clinton apologized for the program in 1997.
[08:29.000 --> 08:32.000]  Reverend Wright also supports a theory from one researcher
[08:32.000 --> 08:36.000]  on how white and African-American children have different ways of learning and thinking.
[08:36.000 --> 08:40.000]  The theory that kids with European origins have a left brain cog
[08:40.000 --> 08:42.000]  from which they learn by observing objects.
[08:42.000 --> 08:46.000]  And that African-American children are right brain oriented,
[08:46.000 --> 08:49.000]  learning creatively and intuitively from people.
[08:49.000 --> 08:53.000]  We spoke with a prominent child psychiatrist and a noted education expert
[08:53.000 --> 08:55.000]  about that left brain, right brain theory.
[08:55.000 --> 08:58.000]  Both said it is not a very widely held view.
[08:58.000 --> 09:00.000]  Brian Todd, CNN, Washington.
[09:00.000 --> 09:04.000]  Okay, so if you tuned in to the first segment, we played the first part of that CNN piece.
[09:04.000 --> 09:09.000]  They don't deny that Reverend Wright is right about
[09:09.000 --> 09:13.000]  government bio weapons being used on different groups of people.
[09:13.000 --> 09:17.000]  But then at the end of it, they just come out with some other issue
[09:17.000 --> 09:19.000]  that they claim Reverend Wright talks about,
[09:19.000 --> 09:27.000]  about different physiological differences between African brains and European brains,
[09:27.000 --> 09:30.000]  which I'm not getting into a debate about,
[09:30.000 --> 09:33.000]  but if you really want to get into just the CAT scans,
[09:33.000 --> 09:38.000]  there is different CC size different on average.
[09:38.000 --> 09:41.000]  You can always find one black brain versus one white brain or one Asian brain
[09:41.000 --> 09:44.000]  and one white brain that are pretty much physiologically the same.
[09:44.000 --> 09:49.000]  But overall, there are characteristic differences in the very physiology
[09:49.000 --> 09:53.000]  of different groups of Homo sapiens sapiens.
[09:53.000 --> 09:59.000]  But regardless, they just throw that into there and then say,
[09:59.000 --> 10:02.000]  oh, we talked to a noted specialist and don't say who,
[10:02.000 --> 10:05.000]  and they said that's not a popular theory.
[10:05.000 --> 10:10.000]  You see, they just mix that in when it has nothing to do with Reverend Wright
[10:10.000 --> 10:16.000]  saying that AIDS, HIV, was engineered as a bio weapon.
[10:16.000 --> 10:20.000]  And they show one book in there, which is all the documents and admissions
[10:20.000 --> 10:25.000]  of South Africa, Israel, and others developing race-specific bio weapons
[10:25.000 --> 10:30.000]  to wipe out certain races of Homo sapiens sapiens.
[10:30.000 --> 10:33.000]  And if there weren't differences, ladies and gentlemen,
[10:33.000 --> 10:38.000]  they couldn't tailor race-specific genotype weapons.
[10:38.000 --> 10:41.000]  By the way, where do we get these conspiracy theories?
[10:41.000 --> 10:47.000]  Published by Dick Cheney, Rebuilding America's Defenses September 20th, 2001,
[10:47.000 --> 10:52.000]  PNAC Public Plan for the Congress and the White House
[10:52.000 --> 10:57.000]  delivered to every member of the House and Senate and to the executive.
[10:57.000 --> 11:03.000]  Where Dick Cheney says we need to legitimize the use of race-specific bio weapons.
[11:03.000 --> 11:06.000]  For heaven's sakes, don't believe me.
[11:06.000 --> 11:12.000]  You lazy police, you lazy FBI listening, you lazy little BATF.
[11:12.000 --> 11:15.000]  You understand this isn't about your shaved heads and your devil tattoos
[11:15.000 --> 11:20.000]  and your Corvette and, you know, acting cool out on your boat on the weekend
[11:20.000 --> 11:22.000]  and being a big tough cop.
[11:22.000 --> 11:25.000]  You understand this isn't about you being a guy worth $100 million
[11:25.000 --> 11:28.000]  that owns car dealerships in New York or Texas.
[11:28.000 --> 11:35.000]  This isn't about you being on the, you know, most elite whites-only country club in California.
[11:35.000 --> 11:40.000]  This isn't about you being a black leader, you know, with your local socialist church
[11:40.000 --> 11:43.000]  who sits around talking about whitey all day.
[11:43.000 --> 11:48.000]  This is life and death. Do you understand?
[11:48.000 --> 11:54.000]  Do you understand that 30-plus years ago they had declassified race weapons?
[11:54.000 --> 11:58.000]  You understand they got level four, and yes, even above that,
[11:58.000 --> 12:02.000]  underground level five laboratories all over the world,
[12:02.000 --> 12:06.000]  and they want to put a control grid in, in the name of fighting al-Qaeda.
[12:06.000 --> 12:09.000]  And if you look at its whole attack pattern, its setup and their admissions,
[12:09.000 --> 12:13.000]  it is built to suppress millions of individual citizens.
[12:13.000 --> 12:18.000]  And all they want is a straight jacket so they can then release this stuff on us.
[12:18.000 --> 12:23.000]  You understand me, FBI, you understand me, police.
[12:23.000 --> 12:26.000]  You understand they're going to kill you too.
[12:26.000 --> 12:29.000]  You understand that if they have their way, you're dead.
[12:29.000 --> 12:32.000]  You're dead! It's over! You understand?
[12:32.000 --> 12:34.000]  You understand what it's like to know this each day?
[12:34.000 --> 12:39.000]  Let's see a bunch of smart-ass, mainline people making jokes and laughing
[12:39.000 --> 12:42.000]  and all the stuff that's going on. This is the real world.
[12:42.000 --> 12:45.000]  This isn't a joke or a game.
[12:45.000 --> 12:56.000]  Oh God, oh God, I can't believe this has to happen before you're going to listen.
[12:56.000 --> 13:03.000]  Oh God, what is even the point of doing this radio show?
[13:03.000 --> 13:08.000]  I told you seven, eight years ago, as time flies, it was back in 2000 I learned.
[13:08.000 --> 13:12.000]  I finally started reading Club of Rome documents, CFR, United Nations,
[13:12.000 --> 13:21.000]  Biological Diversity Assessment documents. I put them in road to tyranny a year later.
[13:21.000 --> 13:28.000]  Where you go read official UN policy, voted on by the General Assembly.
[13:28.000 --> 13:32.000]  That's right, voted on by 170 plus countries.
[13:32.000 --> 13:35.000]  And what does it say?
[13:35.000 --> 13:42.000]  It says that they're going to have a world carbon tax and a card you swipe.
[13:42.000 --> 13:46.000]  And everything you do is going to be on that card for surveillance and control.
[13:46.000 --> 13:50.000]  That's one facet of it. That they're going to tax and regulate every facet of your life.
[13:50.000 --> 13:55.000]  You're going to have inspectors in your home first every year, then every month, then every week.
[13:55.000 --> 13:58.000]  Then you're going to have block captains. Everything's going to be regulated.
[13:58.000 --> 14:02.000]  Total brainwashing. They're going to take the young people and put them in gray uniforms.
[14:02.000 --> 14:06.000]  They even said what the uniforms are going to look like. And when you see the gray uniforms,
[14:06.000 --> 14:11.000]  I want you to remember they do everything they say they're going to do.
[14:11.000 --> 14:15.000]  That's why I'm so freaked out. I keep wishing they'd slow down. I keep wishing I was wrong.
[14:15.000 --> 14:18.000]  I keep wishing that it was only battle plans and they weren't carrying them out.
[14:18.000 --> 14:21.000]  Let me tell you something. They're making a list. They're checking it twice.
[14:21.000 --> 14:23.000]  They're going right down it. They're doing it all.
[14:23.000 --> 14:30.000]  And we're following every step, every step on this chart as we go right into hell.
[14:30.000 --> 14:35.000]  And now they're announcing it in the U.S. in San Francisco and New York and many other cities
[14:35.000 --> 14:39.000]  where they can implement first and all over Canada and in England.
[14:39.000 --> 14:43.000]  I told you they'd have tracker chips that scan everything in your trash can
[14:43.000 --> 14:47.000]  that block captain environmental police would inspect your trash at night
[14:47.000 --> 14:50.000]  from Australia to England to San Francisco. It's now begun.
[14:50.000 --> 14:56.000]  They come to your door, quasi-governmental, semi-deputized.
[14:56.000 --> 15:00.000]  They sick police on you, local control freak volunteers.
[15:00.000 --> 15:03.000]  And they say someone in this household must sign this pledge.
[15:03.000 --> 15:05.000]  There's no law, but they tell you it's the law and threaten you.
[15:05.000 --> 15:09.000]  This is in the news now. Happening now from England to the U.S.
[15:09.000 --> 15:14.000]  City by city under U.N. and George Soros funding.
[15:14.000 --> 15:18.000]  And the Republicans are all with it as well.
[15:18.000 --> 15:21.000]  I told you Bush was going to endorse Kyoto and he did.
[15:21.000 --> 15:23.000]  I told you that six years ago. He did it.
[15:23.000 --> 15:29.000]  We told you a week before he announced it because Bilderberg ordered him to.
[15:29.000 --> 15:36.000]  Now he announced one week after we told you we tell you before the Berlin Wall falls
[15:36.000 --> 15:38.000]  that it was going to happen a year before.
[15:38.000 --> 15:41.000]  We tell you that the attack on Iraq wasn't in 2002 in March.
[15:41.000 --> 15:46.000]  It would be the next year, you know, three in March and it happened exactly to the day.
[15:46.000 --> 15:52.000]  You know why? Because we go and we spy on them to incredible danger to ourselves
[15:52.000 --> 15:57.000]  and our families, you lazy people who don't appreciate anything.
[15:57.000 --> 16:03.000]  They're coming for you. They're already attacking you through the water and the air.
[16:03.000 --> 16:19.000]  I couldn't sleep last night. I've never felt such on edge.
[16:19.000 --> 16:26.000]  They're going to regulate every facet of your life under this.
[16:26.000 --> 16:31.000]  They make you sign a contract under threat just like they make you take shots when there's no law to take them.
[16:31.000 --> 16:33.000]  But millions take it every year.
[16:33.000 --> 16:38.000]  Fourteen, fifteen hundred kids with their families lined up last year just a few months ago.
[16:38.000 --> 16:40.000]  We had the state attorney on.
[16:40.000 --> 16:43.000]  They were on the news saying it's the law. You'll be arrested if you don't take the vaccines.
[16:43.000 --> 16:45.000]  I had him on. He said, yeah, it's not a law.
[16:45.000 --> 16:48.000]  Then I had them on the news saying it was the law.
[16:48.000 --> 16:53.000]  And then he admitted he had vaccinated his own kids.
[16:53.000 --> 16:59.000]  Remember I had him on and there was the newscast, the video of thousands of people, fifteen hundred kids, a bunch of parents.
[16:59.000 --> 17:02.000]  I said fourteen, fifteen hundred. One newscast said fourteen, one said fifteen.
[17:02.000 --> 17:04.000]  That's why I get both numbers. I don't know.
[17:04.000 --> 17:07.000]  A bunch of parents, over a thousand people, children.
[17:07.000 --> 17:16.000]  And they were there with police dogs barking, police in riot gear being herded into a courthouse to be injected.
[17:16.000 --> 17:20.000]  Believing it was the law. That is the darkest tyranny.
[17:20.000 --> 17:24.000]  It's already here.
[17:24.000 --> 17:32.000]  It's already amongst us. We're already deep, deep, deep into tyranny.
[17:32.000 --> 17:38.000]  Those same police officers, they're compartmentalized.
[17:38.000 --> 17:44.000]  They're giving their own children the shots.
[17:44.000 --> 17:51.000]  You see, they believe the football and the baseball and the basketball and the facade and the movies and the fake brotherhood they're in.
[17:51.000 --> 17:55.000]  They believe the system. They think the system's good. They think they're out fighting evil.
[17:55.000 --> 18:00.000]  They think that, you know, the system's wonderful and everything's fine.
[18:00.000 --> 18:10.000]  And, you know, I wish I could believe the world was fine and that the good guys ran the government and that everything was great.
[18:10.000 --> 18:20.000]  There's a lot of things I want to do in my life, a lot of things I want to explore, a lot of places I want to go and see.
[18:20.000 --> 18:23.000]  But you know something?
[18:23.000 --> 18:29.000]  I've decided to face reality. I've decided to really look at what the architects of this world are saying and doing.
[18:29.000 --> 18:33.000]  And they're saying they're going to kill almost all of us listening right now.
[18:33.000 --> 18:39.000]  And let me tell you something. These people do what they say.
[18:39.000 --> 18:46.000]  I told you before 9-11 they were going to stage massive terror attacks probably on the World Trade Center, probably blaming their asset bin Laden.
[18:46.000 --> 18:49.000]  I told you they would have successive attacks.
[18:49.000 --> 18:57.000]  Bring in a world tax, a world army under the guise of environmentalism, the left side of the pencil attack.
[18:57.000 --> 19:05.000]  The CFR has said it's fake. The terror is fake. The environmental movement is fake.
[19:05.000 --> 19:10.000]  Now, does that mean there isn't real environmental problems? Of course there are.
[19:10.000 --> 19:17.000]  They co-opt everything that's real. They're co-opting the left.
[19:17.000 --> 19:21.000]  You think Bush is going to leave and then suddenly Barack Obama or Hillary are going to save us?
[19:21.000 --> 19:34.000]  It's going to be more of the same. It's going to accelerate the amnesty, the open borders, the globalism, the gun control, the taxation, the regulation.
[19:34.000 --> 19:39.000]  Why? It's an illusion. Why do people in the government have to serve this evil?
[19:39.000 --> 19:44.000]  Why do you have to be manipulated and be conned and believe a fairy tale?
[19:44.000 --> 20:13.000]  The mainstream reality is a hoax. I know what the real reality is and I have the proof.
[20:14.000 --> 20:20.000]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die. With laced med inks, patented methodology.

[21:52.000 --> 21:56.000]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[21:56.000 --> 22:08.000]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase outpacing its previous 10 years.
[22:08.000 --> 22:15.000]  The U.S. economy receives its currency by taking on debt through private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[22:15.000 --> 22:19.000]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[22:19.000 --> 22:23.000]  It's bad enough that the U.S. citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[22:23.000 --> 22:29.000]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[22:29.000 --> 22:33.000]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.

[23:23.000 --> 23:30.000]  We reveal the abuses committed under the Protection of the Patriot Act, Military Commissions Act, and other very intrusive spy bills.
[23:30.000 --> 23:38.000]  Washington You're Fired explores the removal of habeas corpus, posicumetatus, and the subversion of our entire Bill of Rights.

[24:29.000 --> 24:34.000]  Hey folks, being an ignorant, I'm talking to people who are new listeners, isn't cute, it's not funny.
[24:34.000 --> 24:37.000]  You can't ignore what I'm saying, you can't laugh at it.
[24:37.000 --> 24:41.000]  I'm telling you the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.
[24:41.000 --> 24:47.000]  So help me God, my word of honor.
[24:47.000 --> 24:52.000]  You think I tell you not to vaccinate your children and I don't do the same for my children?
[24:52.000 --> 25:02.000]  I'm not going to tell you what to do, you just better find out what they're doing to you, you better find out real fast.
[25:02.000 --> 25:07.000]  It's a real frustration, I just want to reach tens of millions of people.
[25:07.000 --> 25:10.000]  I want to reach tens of millions more, I want to warn people.
[25:10.000 --> 25:18.000]  It'd be like if a bridge had collapsed in the middle of nowhere and I saw a car driving down the road and I knew it was about to go around a turn and drive off a cliff.
[25:18.000 --> 25:28.000]  I would sit out in the middle of that road, I'd set up a tent in the middle of that road until we could get up a barrier and until that bridge could get fixed and I'd warn people.
[25:28.000 --> 25:35.000]  And I guess nowadays that's weird, you know they've trained you not to care about yourself, not to care about your neighbors, not to care about your children.
[25:35.000 --> 25:42.000]  They've trained you not to have your normal instincts, you just let CPS take your kids without due process.
[25:42.000 --> 25:44.000]  They've taken your instincts, ladies and gentlemen.
[25:44.000 --> 25:49.000]  I mean, I am so alive and I look at other people, they look like they're half dead, they're mesmerized.
[25:49.000 --> 25:50.000]  And you know why?
[25:50.000 --> 25:56.000]  The average adult, and it goes up every year, but a few years ago I saw the numbers, it had gone up since the last time I saw it.
[25:56.000 --> 26:05.000]  The average adult watches about four hours and 15 minutes a day, the average child is watching close to six hours a day.
[26:05.000 --> 26:11.000]  And just the numbers 10 years ago were more like four and a half hours for a child, three and a half for an adult.
[26:11.000 --> 26:13.000]  Go pull the numbers.
[26:13.000 --> 26:17.000]  I don't even know what they are now.
[26:17.000 --> 26:24.000]  And did you know that when you watch television for more than just a few minutes, it shifts you into a dream state?
[26:24.000 --> 26:27.000]  You ever wonder why it seems like hours pass by?
[26:27.000 --> 26:29.000]  You're watching television.
[26:29.000 --> 26:31.000]  You're mesmerized.
[26:31.000 --> 26:36.000]  And so it's keeping you in a lower state of consciousness, and I don't mean that in a new age way.
[26:36.000 --> 26:41.000]  I mean consciousness in brain waves, in measurable facts.
[26:41.000 --> 26:45.000]  You know, you read the philosophers, you read history, you read accounts.
[26:45.000 --> 26:50.000]  You read, I mean, humans are seething with ideas and passion and creativity.
[26:50.000 --> 26:58.000]  And the good, the bad, and the ugly, the seven deadly sins, and of course, all the great virtues as well.
[26:58.000 --> 27:11.000]  We're seething with love and passion and lust and avarice and violence and greed, but also in all the good things.
[27:11.000 --> 27:15.000]  And that's the great contest of life.
[27:15.000 --> 27:21.000]  And instead, you're living your life out in these simulations. You're not living it in reality.
[27:21.000 --> 27:24.000]  And so I know why a lot of people want to tune out.
[27:24.000 --> 27:29.000]  And they want to just be in La La Land and just eat food and drink and party and think about themselves.
[27:29.000 --> 27:31.000]  But you know that you're totally unhappy.
[27:31.000 --> 27:37.000]  Because for a time, satiating the lower animal lust and levels is fun.
[27:37.000 --> 27:39.000]  And believe me, I've done it, folks.
[27:39.000 --> 27:45.000]  And you know, I've, I mean, I grew up pretty wild, pretty, pretty young.
[27:45.000 --> 27:48.000]  The point is, is that I found none of that was satiating.
[27:48.000 --> 27:49.000]  None of that was satisfying.
[27:49.000 --> 27:54.000]  Sacrifice and adversity and courage and will.
[27:54.000 --> 27:57.000]  It is what's satisfying and love.
[27:57.000 --> 28:06.000]  I mean, I have love for you, love for my family, love that is so intense, it is painful.
[28:06.000 --> 28:11.000]  And it's painful that I am not even good enough to bring you this information,
[28:11.000 --> 28:13.000]  that I don't have some high view of myself.
[28:13.000 --> 28:14.000]  Understand that.
[28:14.000 --> 28:17.000]  But, but I have incredible passion.
[28:17.000 --> 28:19.000]  And again, I have ideas and understandings.
[28:19.000 --> 28:20.000]  I can't even articulate.
[28:20.000 --> 28:21.000]  It's just, it's unbelievable.
[28:21.000 --> 28:23.000]  And I know I'm just average.
[28:23.000 --> 28:24.000]  All of you have this.
[28:24.000 --> 28:25.000]  And so you see reality.
[28:25.000 --> 28:27.000]  You see your real soul.
[28:27.000 --> 28:28.000]  You look into the universe.
[28:28.000 --> 28:30.000]  You stare out into the universe.
[28:30.000 --> 28:33.000]  You stare out into God's creation and you become scared.
[28:33.000 --> 28:34.000]  You have anxiety.
[28:34.000 --> 28:36.000]  You look into reality.
[28:36.000 --> 28:39.000]  You look into the show, which is a window into reality, at least to a greater extent.
[28:39.000 --> 28:43.000]  We don't plan to have the end all be all on reality.
[28:43.000 --> 28:45.000]  And, and it makes your heart beat fast.
[28:45.000 --> 28:46.000]  It causes you anxiety.
[28:46.000 --> 28:50.000]  It causes you, well, that's what it's like to look out into the Grand Canyon.
[28:50.000 --> 28:55.000]  Is it's awe inspiring, but it's also, you know, you feel a great passion.
[28:55.000 --> 28:57.000]  And that scares a lot of people.
[28:57.000 --> 29:01.000]  Or when you look into the night sky or when you look into the eyes of your newborn child,
[29:01.000 --> 29:04.000]  you feel love, exhilaration, but also you think about your death.
[29:04.000 --> 29:07.000]  You think about that child's life that's coming and how are you going to protect it?
[29:07.000 --> 29:12.000]  And the possibilities that to love is to have the possibility of losing.
[29:12.000 --> 29:14.000]  Will that child ever die in a car wreck?
[29:14.000 --> 29:16.000]  Will that child ever get cancer?
[29:16.000 --> 29:17.000]  Will that child ever get a brain tumor?
[29:17.000 --> 29:19.000]  Will that child get hurt?
[29:19.000 --> 29:23.000]  Will that child, see, but that's to live, to face those fears.
[29:23.000 --> 29:28.000]  And then to decide what do you do to try to take control of your environment?
[29:28.000 --> 29:33.000]  Instead, you're just drooling in a corner, watching television, not living in the real world,
[29:33.000 --> 29:37.000]  but you still know that you're missing something on life.
[29:37.000 --> 29:39.000]  And that is fully engaging life.
[29:39.000 --> 29:40.000]  And I challenge you to do that.
[29:40.000 --> 29:42.000]  We'll cover the news when we get back.
[29:53.000 --> 29:57.000]  Hello, I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, author of 15 books on health and natural healing.
[29:57.000 --> 30:01.000]  Vaccines included, medicines kill more people every year than any illness.
[30:01.000 --> 30:05.000]  The cost of drug side effects in America is more than $200 billion annually,
[30:05.000 --> 30:08.000]  with the worst toll taken by antibiotics.
[30:08.000 --> 30:11.000]  But there is a cure for this medical madness that has remained secret.
[30:11.000 --> 30:15.000]  Oxysilver, developed by NASA scientists to keep astronauts healthy,
[30:15.000 --> 30:21.000]  is an evolutionary new dietary supplement making deadly vaccinations and antibiotics obsolete.
[30:21.000 --> 30:25.000]  Taking one to two teaspoons daily boosts natural immunity without drug toxicity.
[30:25.000 --> 30:28.000]  Oxysilver combines oxygen and silver in a new way.
[30:28.000 --> 30:33.000]  The oxygen becomes a supercharged germ killer freeing your immune system to fight colds,
[30:33.000 --> 30:35.000]  flus, cancers, and more.
[30:35.000 --> 30:41.000]  Build disease defenses naturally, painlessly, powerfully, safely, and inexpensively with oxysilver.

[31:01.000 --> 31:06.000]  an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[31:06.000 --> 31:10.000]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation
[31:10.000 --> 31:13.000]  in which family members receive answers to their questions
[31:13.000 --> 31:17.000]  and the true perpetrators of the horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[31:17.000 --> 31:20.000]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 exposé
[31:20.000 --> 31:24.000]  from hijackers being trained at U.S. military bases to bombs in the buildings.

[31:44.000 --> 31:46.000]  We're in a no-holds-bar information war.
[31:46.000 --> 31:50.000]  Truth is our weapon, and prisonplanet.com has the tools you need
[31:50.000 --> 31:53.000]  to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[31:53.000 --> 31:56.000]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water,
[31:56.000 --> 31:59.000]  and did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals
[31:59.000 --> 32:02.000]  while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[32:02.000 --> 32:05.000]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate
[32:05.000 --> 32:07.000]  and others are absorbed into the skin.
[32:07.000 --> 32:11.000]  The KDF dual-media shower filter works with both hot and cold water
[32:11.000 --> 32:16.000]  and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits
[32:16.000 --> 32:19.000]  the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[32:19.000 --> 32:23.000]  The KDF dual-media shower filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons
[32:23.000 --> 32:25.000]  or one year whichever comes first.
[32:25.000 --> 32:29.000]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine,
[32:29.000 --> 32:31.000]  iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.

[33:47.000 --> 33:50.000]  run my life and poison me and my family
[33:50.000 --> 33:52.000]  you got another thing covered.
[34:00.000 --> 34:02.000]  No more Mr. Nice Guy.
[34:03.000 --> 34:06.000]  No more pushing me and my family around.
[34:06.000 --> 34:09.000]  And I'm here to tell all of you out there
[34:10.000 --> 34:12.000]  we are going to defeat the New World Order.
[34:12.000 --> 34:15.000]  We're going to wake the human survival instinct up.
[34:17.000 --> 34:21.000]  And when we're done getting the New World Order out of our way
[34:21.000 --> 34:24.000]  we are going to the stars.
[34:24.000 --> 34:26.000]  I can feel it in my gut.
[34:26.000 --> 34:29.000]  I know it in my soul.
[34:29.000 --> 34:33.000]  I am totally committed to this species.
[34:33.000 --> 34:38.000]  I am totally committed to homo sapiens sapiens.
[34:38.000 --> 34:42.000]  We are going to defeat the sub aberrant predator class.
[34:42.000 --> 34:46.000]  We are going to release the true leadership that is humanity.
[34:46.000 --> 34:49.000]  We are going to move forward to the next level
[34:49.000 --> 34:52.000]  as we have been programmed
[34:52.000 --> 35:09.000]  and directed by the creator of the universe.
[35:23.000 --> 35:26.000]  I'll tell you one thing. I'm not going to live in a false reality.
[35:26.000 --> 35:29.000]  I'm not going to be caught by every caught artist
[35:29.000 --> 35:31.000]  and every hoax that comes by.
[35:31.000 --> 35:33.000]  I'm not going to live like a slave.
[35:33.000 --> 35:35.000]  My soul is free.
[35:35.000 --> 35:37.000]  Free you hear me.
[35:37.000 --> 35:39.000]  You don't own the New World Order.
[35:39.000 --> 35:41.000]  I'm out of your control.
[35:41.000 --> 35:48.000]  Yeah, there's no place for second best.
[35:48.000 --> 35:53.000]  Yeah, there's no place for second best.
[36:06.000 --> 36:09.000]  We're going to free humanity.
[36:09.000 --> 36:12.000]  If you see us around as the word has died
[36:12.000 --> 36:16.000]  if anything like a fool was the case of what died
[36:16.000 --> 36:21.000]  the control freaks want to hold back our progress
[36:21.000 --> 36:24.000]  the control freaks want to get in your way
[36:24.000 --> 36:28.000]  and sit on top of you and suck off of you
[36:28.000 --> 36:32.000]  I want them out of the way
[36:32.000 --> 36:40.640]  With all these little stunted bags of pus, with all these cowardly, weak control freaks
[36:40.640 --> 36:48.320]  that are programming our society, we're going to wake the species up to the threat.
[36:48.320 --> 36:55.440]  You may have turned them into brainwashed poison zombies, but their innate instincts
[36:55.440 --> 37:05.200]  are still there. Even their animal mind knows that you're the enemy. They know the truth.
[37:05.200 --> 37:12.160]  Even if you burn little holes in their cerebral cortex, even though most of them are mindless
[37:12.160 --> 37:21.920]  zombies, they still know what you are. And they know the crime you're committing against
[37:21.920 --> 37:28.160]  our genetic code. They know the crime you're committing against this creation, this planet,
[37:28.160 --> 37:33.120]  in the middle of the universe. They know what you're doing, you wicked vandals,
[37:33.120 --> 37:40.320]  you pieces of filth, trash. You think we're your slaves, you've got another thing coming.
[37:44.400 --> 37:47.920]  I got so mad I think I ripped part of my throat and I got blood in my mouth.
[37:47.920 --> 37:57.440]  I am fired up, ladies and gentlemen. Just get real, just realize how real the world is.
[37:57.440 --> 38:00.800]  You know, I want to get into their slave grid, their dehumanization grid.
[38:04.560 --> 38:08.080]  You got that clip I sent you on Tuesday or Wednesday, John. I forgot to ask you in the
[38:08.080 --> 38:12.000]  break where it's that British newscast. Oh yeah, we heard part of it where they're talking about
[38:12.000 --> 38:16.400]  our wonderful cards, our carbon cards, and how wonderful and how we're going to make money
[38:16.400 --> 38:21.840]  with them when it's a tax. Notice how they introduce it to all the slaves. Notice how
[38:21.840 --> 38:28.480]  they push it to all the slaves. Notice how they unfold it to us, the slaves. I mean,
[38:28.480 --> 38:34.960]  just the way they announce it is a complete disgusting despotism. Oh yeah, they're going
[38:34.960 --> 38:39.520]  to give you a fraction of what it takes, the way they built this grid where we've got to have carbon
[38:39.520 --> 38:44.160]  based systems to travel, to live, to heat our homes and survive. And they're going to set us
[38:44.160 --> 38:48.640]  at about half of what we need at first and ratchet that down. And then yeah, I guess you
[38:48.640 --> 38:51.680]  can live homeless under a bridge. You'll have extra carbon credits that can sell it.
[38:52.560 --> 38:55.840]  So that's how they deceptively sell it. So the cattle out there here and go,
[38:55.840 --> 39:01.520]  oh, I'll make money off the new tax, you idiots. Listen to this staged event. Just listen to your
[39:01.520 --> 39:08.400]  enemies. Would you live in a greener lifestyle if you could make money from it? That may be
[39:08.400 --> 39:13.280]  possible if a government proposal for personal carbon emissions allowances is implemented under
[39:13.280 --> 39:18.880]  the scheme. Everyone in the UK would be allocated an annual carbon allowance. Stored electronically,
[39:18.880 --> 39:24.160]  rather like a supermarket loyalty card, points would be deducted every time we buy or use non-renewable
[39:24.160 --> 39:29.520]  energy. For example, using electricity to power appliances in the home. Or traveling somewhere
[39:29.520 --> 39:33.760]  by plane. Or even buying petrol for your car on the forecourt. Now, any points left over could
[39:33.760 --> 39:39.120]  then be sold back to a central bank. Are you still with us? And people who need more, like
[39:39.120 --> 39:44.160]  Motris, who had used their allocations could then pay for a top-up. Let's stop right there.
[39:44.960 --> 39:50.320]  Stop right there where that little tart is pushing propaganda with a sweet smiley girl next door
[39:50.320 --> 39:56.320]  face. The corporate engineers bring those in. It's, oh, nice girl next door. Nice front to
[39:56.320 --> 40:02.240]  sell you a dagger between your ribs, right into your heart. It's black gouts of your soul pour out.
[40:02.240 --> 40:10.720]  What does she sit there and tell everybody? Oh, you sell your carbon credits back to the
[40:10.720 --> 40:17.520]  central bank. The private bankers literally having attacks on all interactions, all energy,
[40:17.520 --> 40:22.400]  with scores of bureaucrats, local, state, federal, international feeding on you every
[40:22.400 --> 40:25.680]  facet of your life. I mean, it isn't just going to be a tax, ladies and gentlemen.
[40:25.680 --> 40:33.200]  It's going to be total control on everything you do. You think we're down to only 10% of the family
[40:33.200 --> 40:39.840]  farms we had 50 years ago. Get ready for none. Get ready for hell. And a whole parasite class
[40:39.840 --> 40:49.360]  unleashed. You like 2 million cops in the U.S.? How about 20 million? Oh, God help us. Go back
[40:49.360 --> 40:54.640]  to these enemies. Go back to these slave masters. This is pure feudalism. Listen to them. You think
[40:54.640 --> 40:57.920]  they've been pushing and brainwashing with environmentalism and there's got to be a quote
[40:57.920 --> 41:03.600]  solution in classes for 50 years and brainwashing and spending trillions for nothing. They're now
[41:03.600 --> 41:08.320]  coming up. They're now with the NFL and all the major corporations pushing that it's real. Global
[41:08.320 --> 41:13.120]  warming is real. Oh my gosh. The polar bears are all dying when their numbers are higher than ever.
[41:13.120 --> 41:18.720]  And oh my gosh, just lie after lie after lie after lie after lie after lie to get this through on you
[41:18.720 --> 41:25.760]  with cities all over the U.S. passing carbon taxes. We got one of the minions coming on today. Oh,
[41:25.760 --> 41:31.040]  I got guests after guests for you coming up later. And I am tormented, ladies and gentlemen,
[41:31.040 --> 41:35.200]  to watch this evil going into place, to know that they've stated what they're doing.
[41:37.680 --> 41:42.560]  Go ahead and bother us, please. We're paying for the petrol or the electricity, etc. We're here
[41:42.560 --> 41:48.080]  to discuss the proposals. Dr. Mary Hellman from the Policy Studies Institute and James Woodhousen,
[41:48.080 --> 41:54.720]  who's a professor of forecasting innovation at De Montfort University. Good morning to you both.
[41:54.720 --> 41:59.840]  It's, um, well, it's a very intriguing idea, but will it work? Mayor, let's start with you. Well,
[41:59.840 --> 42:04.640]  I first proposed the idea in 1990, and I'm delighted that the government is now seriously
[42:04.640 --> 42:10.400]  addressing this as an option. I believe it to be the only option for the future of mankind.
[42:10.400 --> 42:15.680]  The planet, as you know, is deteriorating in terms of its condition. And the only way in which it
[42:15.680 --> 42:20.800]  can be addressed is not through the medium of wishful thinking that technology can ride to the
[42:20.800 --> 42:27.840]  rescue or that somehow or other we can exhort or persuade people to modify their lifestyles to
[42:27.840 --> 42:33.440]  the extent required. And the solution that I've proposed is, of course, on the basis of personal
[42:33.440 --> 42:38.800]  carbon rationing. Right. James, that's the only option? No, I don't believe so. I think the whole
[42:38.800 --> 42:44.320]  attempt to make us feel guilty about what we're doing is very misguided. And really, we ought to
[42:44.320 --> 42:50.400]  be focusing on supply-side innovations rather than finger-wagging every time you boil a cup of tea.
[42:50.400 --> 42:55.120]  Supply-side innovations? Well, we need better power stations. We need tidal power. We need
[42:55.120 --> 43:00.400]  nuclear power. We need every kind of thing that makes a difference so that we can be more thoughtless
[43:00.400 --> 43:04.960]  about energy use and more thoughtful about the planning of future energy supply.
[43:04.960 --> 43:09.600]  See, in some senses, some people would say it's a nice idea, maybe. It's completely impracticable.
[43:09.600 --> 43:15.600]  For instance, people who live in the country who have to drive 10 miles to get to their shops would
[43:15.600 --> 43:20.560]  be penalized for that. People who have to travel abroad on business, go across Atlanta, would
[43:20.560 --> 43:24.240]  presumably be penalized for that as well. See, stop right there. How would you ever get...
[43:24.240 --> 43:31.200]  See, they speak to the foolish childlike bedwetting class that is the majority of the western
[43:31.200 --> 43:35.360]  population now, little nittying chicken neck cowards that think the government cares about them
[43:35.360 --> 43:40.000]  and wants to take care of them. Notice how they present it to the zombies. They say,
[43:40.000 --> 43:43.760]  zombies, you're going to make money off this when it's a total tax, total regulatory grid
[43:43.760 --> 43:46.960]  with a card that tracks everything you buy, everything you do. As I told you years ago,
[43:46.960 --> 43:49.840]  they would do because it was in their own documents. And then they end up saying,
[43:49.840 --> 43:54.160]  oh, that will penalize people going off this old energy system or even new ones. Oh, you're
[43:54.160 --> 44:01.920]  wanting to penalize people in the little nitty-sitter. Oh, penalize me. Oh, that penalizes me.
[44:01.920 --> 44:09.200]  I mean, it's just that how knowingly deceptive these people are. It's so disgusting.
[44:11.440 --> 44:15.040]  It's just every bed of its lies. I'll go back to them.
[44:15.600 --> 44:19.200]  How would you ever get it to work? Well, give me another solution.
[44:19.200 --> 44:22.800]  See, stop right there. How would you ever get it to work? These are all trained statements.
[44:22.800 --> 44:26.800]  Nailing the average person doesn't know how to screw in a light bulb, doesn't know how power
[44:26.800 --> 44:29.920]  gets to their house, doesn't know where meat comes from. I mean, really, they think it comes in
[44:29.920 --> 44:35.520]  packages. I've run into young people that think they do surgery on the cows to get the meat out.
[44:35.520 --> 44:39.360]  Yeah, they do a surgery, all right. You know, this is what we're talking about.
[44:40.160 --> 44:45.680]  And so they say, how would you make it work? See, speaking to backside engineering,
[44:46.400 --> 44:50.240]  knowing that the average person, if they don't know how it works, they don't think it exists.
[44:50.240 --> 44:56.560]  How would you make other energy systems work? How would you? The government says it's easy.
[44:56.560 --> 45:02.480]  I'll make money. I want the system. He's not giving me any details. He just says I'll make money
[45:02.480 --> 45:07.920]  off regulators and taxes and being arrested for dropping a banana peel or putting too much garbage
[45:07.920 --> 45:12.880]  in my trash can and having neighborhood watch squads controlling me and tracking everything
[45:12.880 --> 45:21.520]  I do on a debit card tracker system. I love it. Don't you give me details? See, go back to it.
[45:21.520 --> 45:28.320]  Give me another solution to the serious problem of the fact. But that's not to say how your system,
[45:28.320 --> 45:31.520]  just saying others wouldn't work doesn't mean that yours would.
[45:31.520 --> 45:36.800]  Well, the detail can't be explained in the... See, the other guy understands their tactics. He
[45:36.800 --> 45:42.080]  understands purely. See, it's all like talking to a child. You can only fool a four-year-old,
[45:42.080 --> 45:47.920]  but the average Western is like a four-year-old. That won't work. That's not real. Oh, but a huge
[45:47.920 --> 45:54.160]  scam on carbon dioxide that plants breathe, oxygen, carbon dioxide, sunlight, water. That's the four
[45:54.160 --> 45:59.840]  ingredients for life on this planet, and they're going to have a corner on it, and they're going
[45:59.840 --> 46:07.120]  to tax you to use it. That's a tax on breathing air. That's what they say it is. So, oh, yes,
[46:07.120 --> 46:11.760]  oh, this is wonderful. It's for the earth. You've got all these idiot environmentalists
[46:11.760 --> 46:16.560]  who have no idea there's totally out of control genetic engineering that can any day and already
[46:16.560 --> 46:22.080]  has had some problems, make the Andromeda strain look like a joke. I mean, that's the stuff worse
[46:22.080 --> 46:31.840]  than that that you see in that old 70s movie. A minute or two, it is outlined in the report
[46:31.840 --> 46:36.720]  that in the book, the Penguin book, I wrote called How We Can Save the Planet, and the detail is
[46:36.720 --> 46:42.480]  given there. The propositions that James has put forward, of course, are in no way invalidated by
[46:42.480 --> 46:48.080]  the concept of personal carbon rashing. In fact, it would drive the solutions that he is putting
[46:48.080 --> 46:56.320]  forward as people learn to live within the rational. Learn to live within the rational.
[46:56.960 --> 47:01.680]  I have mainstream news. The British Parliament is announcing that everyone will live under rations
[47:01.680 --> 47:07.040]  like World War II, and now they get to control the energy. They get to jack up the price. Remember
[47:07.040 --> 47:11.600]  when they had rationing under Enron, and they stole 20 something million dollars in just a few months
[47:11.600 --> 47:17.760]  from the people, turned out they had plenty of power. This is the same thing. This is a con
[47:17.760 --> 47:23.920]  that will make all the income taxes, all the property taxes, all the security fees, all of it
[47:23.920 --> 47:29.920]  look like nothing. This is government and the private banks and the private energy companies
[47:29.920 --> 47:35.680]  raping the daylights out of you, where you'll have no money for anything, which they also control that.
[47:35.680 --> 47:42.480]  I mean, this is purely making the entire global economy and society a control system,
[47:42.480 --> 47:46.880]  where all the levels of energy input and the symbols of energy, the currency,
[47:46.880 --> 47:52.000]  are controlled by these people. This is a total monopoly, and they are going to squeeze you
[47:52.000 --> 47:56.320]  financially to your eyeballs pop out. And then when you can't pay for money, you'll go on government
[47:56.320 --> 47:59.920]  welfare, and your kids are going to grow up in government dormitories like in China,
[47:59.920 --> 48:06.320]  about half their kids do. It's all over, folks. Hell on earth. It is now coming. Will you fight it?
[48:06.320 --> 48:10.080]  Will you educate your idiot neighbors? Will your idiot neighbors care enough?
[48:12.320 --> 48:19.120]  I just, I can't believe this. This is like the analogy is, seeing an 18-year-old woman leaving
[48:19.120 --> 48:24.720]  work, you know that it's Ted Bundy, yellow Volkswagen, he's going to torture her, he's going to kill
[48:24.720 --> 48:30.080]  her. You, you're, you're basically restrained. You can't, you know, physically restrain her,
[48:30.080 --> 48:34.000]  and you're saying he's not nice, he's bad, he's going to kill you. He's, don't get in the car.
[48:34.000 --> 48:39.760]  Don't, don't, please. And it's just, ah, I'm for the earth. Oh, I love the government. Oh,
[48:39.760 --> 48:47.840]  I just, for the penguins, I'm doing this. And I'm just going, no, God, no, but it isn't just you.
[48:48.800 --> 48:54.000]  It's not just you. I don't know out there. It's me. It's my family. It's my progeny.
[48:54.000 --> 49:00.160]  In a global, total control grid, scientifically designed, as the head of the CFR, Richard
[49:00.160 --> 49:05.200]  Haas wrote, to make humans the enemy, and the elite will direct the war against ourselves.
[49:07.040 --> 49:13.840]  A global, highly regulatory police state, run by vicious eugenicist control freaks.
[49:14.640 --> 49:19.040]  And once their grid's in place, and we're very close, we're less than 10 years out
[49:19.040 --> 49:23.440]  at current growth levels, they're then going to start wiping our butts out in mass. I mean,
[49:23.440 --> 49:27.120]  again, everything they've said, everything they've planned, everything, the club of
[49:27.120 --> 49:32.640]  Rome said they'd do in the 60s. By this time, they have done. They're about five years behind.
[49:34.480 --> 49:39.520]  They're at about 2002 levels, 2003 levels, what they said they'd be in 2000.
[49:43.520 --> 49:47.680]  I mean, by that, they're about 2003 levels for what they say they'd be in 2008.
[49:47.680 --> 49:54.320]  In 2000, they were at about 97 levels. I mean, it's all there, all for you to read,
[49:54.320 --> 49:59.280]  all for you to find out, all for you to know. And I'm like somebody in one of those
[50:00.160 --> 50:04.400]  Old Temple of Doom type movies, they had them back in the 40s and 50s, where they're in the pit,
[50:04.400 --> 50:08.000]  and the sand's coming in, and the Egyptian pyramid, and the sand's raising up, it's going
[50:08.000 --> 50:11.920]  to bury us, it's going to kill us, and the sand's pouring in on one. Look at the sand.
[50:11.920 --> 50:16.080]  Look at the sand. We got to, I need your help to push this lever. One person can't do it. We
[50:16.080 --> 50:20.560]  got to push this lever and get out. And you're like, well, maybe there's not sand.
[50:21.120 --> 50:25.280]  And I'm going, no, no, no, there's sand right there. It's pouring in. You're going, no, there's
[50:25.280 --> 50:29.520]  not sand. I'm like, you can see it right there. You can read their own documents, see their own
[50:29.520 --> 50:34.560]  policies, see them. You're like, no, it doesn't exist. And now it's up to our chest, and we're
[50:34.560 --> 50:38.240]  climbed up on top of the sand. We got a crouch down now that's coming towards the ceiling,
[50:38.800 --> 50:42.720]  and you're just still giggling and laughing and snickering and doing everything you do.

[52:16.720 --> 52:23.920]  Archaeological diggings done by the McAllister Exploration Fund 1904-1909 at Gieser and McAllister
[52:23.920 --> 52:31.040]  in the old land of the Kenanites dug up remains of little children. Further archaeological exploration
[52:31.040 --> 52:37.360]  showed that the Kenanites' houses in Megiddo and Jericho had dead children concealed in the walls.
[52:38.240 --> 52:43.840]  One wonders what was going on there way back then. Archaeologists have an explanation,
[52:43.840 --> 52:50.320]  but it's gruesome and ugly. Then one wonders what was going on back, but not so far back,
[52:50.320 --> 52:56.720]  to about 200 years ago, at the house of Ben Franklin. Benjamin Franklin's house at 36 Craven
[52:56.720 --> 53:03.520]  Street in London, the house he lived in in the 1700s there in London. That house, where $1.9
[53:03.520 --> 53:09.920]  million was spent in restoration to open it up to the public. Guess what workmen found buried
[53:09.920 --> 53:16.720]  underneath that house? And what could possibly be the explanation of that find? What was dug up
[53:16.720 --> 53:22.000]  was ugly and gruesome, but fast covered up by the media. Want to know the untold story we're

[54:11.840 --> 54:16.400]  Maybe it's a bad, bad thing. Maybe it's a bad, bad thing.
[54:18.160 --> 54:22.800]  Maybe it's a bad, bad thing. Maybe it's a bad, bad thing.
[54:24.480 --> 54:28.400]  Here we'll have some of some what you thought your little heart was gonna break into.
[54:29.200 --> 54:34.640]  Ben Franklin, you ever try with all your heart and soul to get your love back to you?
[54:34.640 --> 54:41.760]  I want to hope so. You ever pray with all your heart and soul just to walk, to walk away?
[54:43.520 --> 54:51.600]  Maybe it's a bad, bad thing. Maybe it's a bad, bad thing. Maybe it's a bad, bad thing.
[54:51.600 --> 54:56.080]  Feel like crying. Feel like crying.
[54:56.080 --> 55:03.200]  Feel like crying. You ever toss and turn your light away thinking about the one you love?
[55:05.200 --> 55:09.200]  Yeah. You ever close your eyes and make them believe you're holding the one you're dreaming of?
[55:09.200 --> 55:12.240]  Maybe it's a bad, bad thing. Maybe it's a bad, bad thing.
[55:12.240 --> 55:17.200]  It is so bad when you finally know just how low, low, low, low, low, low should be.
[55:17.200 --> 55:23.280]  Maybe it's a bad, bad thing. Bottom line, maybe it's a bad, bad thing.
[55:23.280 --> 55:27.840]  I love humanity. I'm angry with humanity. I'm upset with humanity
[55:29.120 --> 55:32.160]  because I don't have a high view of myself. I don't.
[55:34.560 --> 55:42.400]  But I know the UN in every country from Serbia to Rwanda is run by pedophiles.
[55:42.400 --> 55:46.400]  They go in in every case, mass rape the children, put them on C-130s,
[55:46.400 --> 55:51.440]  fly them into Saudi Arabia, Israel, Thailand, snuff films, mass murder, everything.
[55:51.440 --> 55:54.240]  You don't believe me? It's even been in the mainstream news and nobody goes to jail.
[55:57.120 --> 56:01.280]  And sometimes I'll be at a family reunion or event and somebody I'll tell them that
[56:01.280 --> 56:04.240]  and they'll just look at me like I'm nuts. Hey man, I'm not the crazy one.
[56:04.240 --> 56:07.680]  You're the crazy one for not knowing about it going on because you don't read newspapers.
[56:09.520 --> 56:13.680]  You know what it's like knowing that the evil has gotten into power and is now kicking out
[56:13.680 --> 56:18.240]  all the good people that were left and is now recruiting pure evil? The military is hiring
[56:18.240 --> 56:21.600]  thousands and thousands every month of aggravated felons and illegal aliens.
[56:25.840 --> 56:29.280]  These are the type of things that are so incredible I have trouble believing them.
[56:29.280 --> 56:32.160]  You understand things that have never happened are happening right now.
[56:32.160 --> 56:36.400]  Just, just, just, they're going for broke. The establishment is going for broke.
[56:38.480 --> 56:41.920]  Yesterday it hit me on air. They haven't only stolen four trillion,
[56:41.920 --> 56:44.880]  taken all the pension funds, all the Pentagon investments of 50 years
[56:44.880 --> 56:49.520]  and won't say where it went. Just gone.
[56:50.160 --> 56:54.560]  They've made three trillion in no bid contracts and funding in the last five plus years.
[56:55.120 --> 56:59.520]  Three trillion. That's seven trillion. You bet they're going for broke.
[57:00.240 --> 57:04.160]  You know how many police and militaries and intelligence agencies and private mercs?
[57:04.720 --> 57:07.600]  Of course they can pay these mercenaries 180 grand a year.
[57:10.320 --> 57:12.640]  And of course they can find men that'll do whatever they're told.
[57:12.640 --> 57:18.960]  Blackwater is now Blackworld worldwide. All you idiots are going Blackwater, USA,
[57:18.960 --> 57:22.720]  give me a break. Cheney, the old companies, they're all moving to Dubai.
[57:22.720 --> 57:25.600]  They're all moving to Switzerland. They're all moving to Portugal.
[57:25.600 --> 57:30.640]  They're all moving to Uruguay. All the big money is pulling out of this country
[57:32.400 --> 57:36.880]  because they're folding it in on itself. They are going to do a Soviet massacre in here.
[57:36.880 --> 57:43.040]  This is how they reorganize and then they'll come back in 20 years.
[57:44.320 --> 57:47.440]  You cops want to be on a power trip. You want to knock heads and kill some people.
[57:47.440 --> 57:49.360]  You're going to, it's like an all you can eat buffet.
[57:50.080 --> 57:52.640]  You might like one or two hot dogs to beat somebody up.
[57:52.640 --> 57:56.080]  Taser, somebody act tough. Swat team, somebody kill somebody.
[57:57.120 --> 57:59.200]  Makes you feel manly. Put a notch on your belt.
[57:59.840 --> 58:03.760]  Part of your little power trip. How about eating a hundred hot dogs a day?
[58:03.760 --> 58:09.440]  How about 200 hot dogs a day? You want to really kill some people?
[58:10.080 --> 58:13.920]  You're going to get a chance to. Do you know that, Bubba? They've been getting you ready for.
[58:16.080 --> 58:20.160]  And you're going to find out what that devil tattoo in your arm really means, officer.
[58:21.760 --> 58:24.880]  You're going to get to see the killing fields, boy.
[58:24.880 --> 58:33.920]  You're going to get to walk the walk you've been talking, big man.

[1:00:09.920 --> 1:00:13.360]  Alex Jones. We are now into hour number two.
[1:00:16.720 --> 1:00:20.160]  We have a city official coming on. I'm just going to leave it at that,
[1:00:21.280 --> 1:00:29.600]  where they're implementing a human feudalism tax, a total enslavement tax.
[1:00:29.600 --> 1:00:32.960]  I mean, I'm not joking when I use those terms. I'm not going to come up with something even more
[1:00:32.960 --> 1:00:39.760]  evil to describe it. Just a total tax, a total enslavement tax, a prison tax, a grid tax, a
[1:00:39.760 --> 1:00:45.760]  hell tax, an unspeakable tax, the end of the line tax, the ultimate tax, the final tax,
[1:00:46.560 --> 1:00:52.320]  the final solution tax, the extermination tax, the global genocide tax.
[1:00:52.320 --> 1:01:00.240]  Oh, God. We got another guest coming up who's against it all.
[1:01:02.320 --> 1:01:06.800]  I'll tell you about that later too. I mean, here's the news I got in front of me.
[1:01:06.800 --> 1:01:11.360]  I told you I saw Homeland Security had Ridge say this now five years ago
[1:01:15.280 --> 1:01:19.760]  when he first got into Homeland Security. But here's Reuters today.
[1:01:19.760 --> 1:01:25.520]  Shared off Keen on Israeli airport security technologies, the headline, and then they say
[1:01:25.520 --> 1:01:30.880]  that it'll be on city streets at public places, that there's going to be police asking you questions,
[1:01:30.880 --> 1:01:35.200]  searching you, no Fourth Amendment. I mean, that's why I won't go to Israel. I love to go to Israel
[1:01:35.200 --> 1:01:38.320]  and see the Holy Land. But I mean, I'm not going to be interrogated, screamed at, yelled at.
[1:01:40.400 --> 1:01:42.640]  In your face, policing is what it's called, detained.
[1:01:42.640 --> 1:01:49.840]  What's that term Tony Montana uses? You want a Chavano on every corner?
[1:01:50.800 --> 1:01:55.040]  What's the term in Spanish he uses for like a thug on the corner telling you, watching you,
[1:01:55.040 --> 1:01:57.360]  telling you what to sleep, how to sleep, what to wear, what to do.
[1:02:00.240 --> 1:02:01.040]  You want to be a sheep?
[1:02:06.480 --> 1:02:11.840]  And this is it. They're announcing the rollout of I don't think I can handle it if I'm at the mall
[1:02:11.840 --> 1:02:15.120]  or walking down the street and just some thugs and black uniforms come up and it's already happening,
[1:02:15.120 --> 1:02:21.520]  but I'm just going to go get out of my face trash, get away from me scum, murdering filth.
[1:02:21.520 --> 1:02:26.080]  You work for murderers. You understand, you idiots. God, you make me sick.
[1:02:29.840 --> 1:02:31.680]  You're disgustingly foolish.
[1:02:34.160 --> 1:02:37.840]  U.S. Homeland Security Massade agent. I would have him. He's not even an American
[1:02:37.840 --> 1:02:45.200]  publicly his mother found a massage. We have to have foreigners running everything. I mean,
[1:02:45.200 --> 1:02:50.160]  it's just no end to the insults. U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said on
[1:02:50.160 --> 1:02:54.800]  Thursday he will seek to adopt novel Israeli methods like behavioral detection technology.
[1:02:54.800 --> 1:02:59.120]  This is because you're blinking your eyes when you go by a cop or frowning. That's quote probable
[1:02:59.120 --> 1:03:05.280]  cause. It's not you scumbag to better secure America's airports. The scenario where Israel
[1:03:05.280 --> 1:03:09.600]  has a lot of experience. Chertoff said in interviewing with Reuters, I think that it is of
[1:03:09.600 --> 1:03:17.920]  interest to us to see if there is any adaptation there. Israeli has been during international
[1:03:17.920 --> 1:03:21.840]  airport known for strict security measures relies heavily on techniques that detect suspicious
[1:03:21.840 --> 1:03:28.560]  behavior among travelers and harassing old American ladies is their favorite. Chertoff said
[1:03:28.560 --> 1:03:32.800]  such methods as well as Israeli technologies that detect explosives are some of the things
[1:03:32.800 --> 1:03:37.280]  that may help protect U.S. airports and other public places against the tax. Then you go to
[1:03:37.280 --> 1:03:43.360]  his actual press conference and the press release and it says what we told you metal detectors in
[1:03:44.480 --> 1:03:49.840]  malls on the streets, vans driving around, saturation patrols, shotgun and any other terms.
[1:03:49.840 --> 1:03:53.280]  Just where they just randomly pull you over randomly. Walkups are asking you questions.
[1:03:55.360 --> 1:03:59.120]  Oh, God, it's and a lot of them are going to be felons doing it.
[1:03:59.120 --> 1:04:04.560]  One of the new systems presented at the conference developed by Israeli technology company,
[1:04:04.560 --> 1:04:08.400]  we see you. That means the Homeland Security money is going right to his bosses in Israel.
[1:04:08.400 --> 1:04:13.200]  That's also part of this uses behavioral science together with biometric sensors to detect sensor
[1:04:14.000 --> 1:04:17.840]  intentions among travelers. I mean, are we going to have to have Israelis running it?
[1:04:17.840 --> 1:04:22.320]  I guess they'll be our overlords sitting up in skyboxes like they're putting up in New York kind
[1:04:22.320 --> 1:04:29.040]  of just I guess it'll be one big Palestine here. I guess they'll follow orders so they'll do it.
[1:04:29.600 --> 1:04:35.040]  All part of the foreign troops is they're bringing in former Russian advisors,
[1:04:35.040 --> 1:04:41.280]  Israeli advisors, anybody who hates this country. I guess Israel and I guess it's true people are
[1:04:41.280 --> 1:04:46.480]  saying I guess this Israel is almost like fully taking over the U.S. Just kind of talk about a
[1:04:46.480 --> 1:04:54.240]  bug eating a lion. Our beloved Republic is on her knees. The forces of globalism are destroying
[1:04:54.240 --> 1:04:59.120]  national sovereignty worldwide. But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope. The first time in

[1:07:50.160 --> 1:07:53.760]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents
[1:07:53.760 --> 1:08:05.840]  The Alex Jones Show because there's a war on for your mind.
[1:08:05.840 --> 1:08:12.800]  Michael Chertoff has announced what Governor Ridge Homeland Security had before him said.
[1:08:12.800 --> 1:08:17.680]  The Attorney General saying that Israel is going to advise and basically their companies are going
[1:08:17.680 --> 1:08:26.560]  to run domestic surveillance training the police and local Tattletale squads to claim that your
[1:08:26.560 --> 1:08:30.720]  facial mannerisms are an excuse to come up and talk to you, search you, metal detectors everywhere,
[1:08:31.280 --> 1:08:36.080]  basically viper teams everywhere randomly searching you. And then he mixed into that
[1:08:36.080 --> 1:08:42.080]  border security how they're going to build 500 miles of fence. All they got to do is take the
[1:08:42.080 --> 1:08:46.480]  marine expeditionary unit they're going to have in Indiana, training everybody for martial law
[1:08:46.480 --> 1:08:52.000]  in a few days admittedly and stick them down there and open fire on Mexican troops when they
[1:08:52.000 --> 1:08:58.240]  shoot at us every day and things are then real quick. All they got to do is start truly prosecuting
[1:08:58.240 --> 1:09:02.160]  employers that hire illegal aliens. I mean throw the book at them and I mean thousands of
[1:09:02.160 --> 1:09:06.960]  prosecutions a month which they normally love to raise money and do all that but something
[1:09:06.960 --> 1:09:12.240]  that's actually constitutional they won't do. In fact they'll have federal judges tell a suburb
[1:09:12.240 --> 1:09:19.600]  of Dallas, oh you can't ask for citizenship to get an apartment. Oh you've got to ask a
[1:09:19.600 --> 1:09:24.480]  citizen for an ID card and a bank statement and make sure that they don't have any liens against
[1:09:24.480 --> 1:09:30.080]  them or they've paid their taxes. Citizens have to prove themselves but an illegal alien doesn't
[1:09:30.720 --> 1:09:34.880]  and that a bunch of illegal aliens or somebody posting on info wars in the comment stories.
[1:09:34.880 --> 1:09:40.160]  We posted some dry you know few paragraphs with a link to a Miami story about how the majority
[1:09:40.160 --> 1:09:44.560]  of people speak Spanish and you can't really get a job if you don't speak Spanish in one of the most
[1:09:44.560 --> 1:09:49.120]  popular cities in the US and they were in there saying I'm a racist and hate Mexicans and Hispanics.
[1:09:49.120 --> 1:09:55.120]  Give me a newsflash I could care less buddy boy. What color your skin is? I really don't care.
[1:09:55.120 --> 1:09:59.440]  You understand that? I'm trying to keep Planned Parenthoods out of your neighborhoods where
[1:09:59.440 --> 1:10:05.040]  they're killing your little Latino babies you idiots. Why don't you go stop the deathmills in
[1:10:05.040 --> 1:10:10.720]  your communities morons? Talk to people posting in my site. I know what's being said on the Spanish
[1:10:10.720 --> 1:10:16.640]  radio stations. I know what the names of them are. So stop acting like I'm the racist and the
[1:10:16.640 --> 1:10:29.280]  tribalist when it's you. Makes me want to throw up in there about how I'm a gringo pig. I mean
[1:10:29.280 --> 1:10:36.960]  you're in there calling me a racist but then laughing about how I'm a fat gringo pig. Oh really?
[1:10:36.960 --> 1:10:43.840]  Am I calling you names? Do I call black people my otters? Which means black birds? Do I call you
[1:10:45.280 --> 1:10:51.440]  racial slurs? See it's supposedly okay for you two but not me. I'm done. The guilt's over. The
[1:10:51.440 --> 1:11:00.240]  buffaloing is over. You understand? It's over. I don't care what you think about me. Any of you
[1:11:01.120 --> 1:11:10.800]  stupid white yuppies, dumb racist black people, Asians, Mexicans, Nicaraguans, El Salvadorans.
[1:11:10.800 --> 1:11:17.120]  I don't care what you think about me. You run around and they were saying Viva La Raza, Alex is
[1:11:17.120 --> 1:11:23.120]  a fat gringo pig and all this stuff. Up with our race, you're a fat white pig. That's real cute.
[1:11:24.560 --> 1:11:29.920]  Am I calling you names? No I'm not. I'm saying how dare you run around, work for the new
[1:11:29.920 --> 1:11:34.560]  world order. What you do, whether you know it or not, they're all give you first class treatment.
[1:11:34.560 --> 1:11:41.360]  I get third class treatment. You know why? Because I'm a dumb white hog. I really am. And I'm here.
[1:11:41.360 --> 1:11:46.000]  I've got the mark on me to be sucked off of because I think I'm free and I think I had it made and
[1:11:46.000 --> 1:11:51.200]  I think I was the boss. So because I think I'm on top, I'll go along with anything. That's what
[1:11:51.200 --> 1:12:01.280]  white people are. It's a disgusting group of trash. But you, people out there who hate every other
[1:12:01.280 --> 1:12:07.840]  group but then say you're not trash, you're trash too. You're trashy because you don't understand
[1:12:07.840 --> 1:12:12.720]  the new world order lets you offer DWIs, lets you offer no ID, but throws the book at a Mexican
[1:12:12.720 --> 1:12:21.360]  American or a black person or a white person or an Asian or a African albino. They don't care folks,
[1:12:21.360 --> 1:12:25.760]  if you're a scum, when you've got your ID, it means you've been conditioned, trained,
[1:12:25.760 --> 1:12:32.080]  you're there to be raped and fed on in blood. We're kind of like that, there's one African tribe
[1:12:32.080 --> 1:12:36.960]  that drinks the blood, mixes it with milk and stuff with their cows for protein. They're in
[1:12:36.960 --> 1:12:41.600]  Kenya, I forget the name of the tribe. That's kind of like what we are as Americans. They walk up,
[1:12:41.600 --> 1:12:46.800]  they got a little hammer with a little wood stick, they hit the artery on the neck and get a bucket
[1:12:46.800 --> 1:12:53.840]  of blood and then clot it up and they go mix it with urine and milk and drink it. That's the
[1:12:53.840 --> 1:13:01.520]  government. That's what we are. The cop just pulls up any excuse, knocks a hole in the order,
[1:13:01.520 --> 1:13:05.840]  he sucks some blood out, drives off, goes and gives this kid the next day a shot that brain
[1:13:05.840 --> 1:13:14.480]  damages him for life. You're getting sucked off of too brother. Oh man, I'm in full rant mode today
[1:13:14.480 --> 1:13:19.360]  because I can't handle it anymore. I just can't handle it anymore and I've been working really
[1:13:19.360 --> 1:13:23.760]  hard and always slept like a rock my whole life but man, I get in bed now and I feel real melancholy
[1:13:23.760 --> 1:13:28.080]  and upset and I'm worried about everybody and I want to warn people and I want to be stoic and I
[1:13:28.080 --> 1:13:33.120]  want to be well spoken and I want to be nice about it and in just all the craziness and the
[1:13:33.120 --> 1:13:37.280]  badness I see in the average people and the badness I see in the system and also then there's the
[1:13:37.280 --> 1:13:41.680]  good I see in everybody. It's so beautiful, so wonderful. There's so much great things in life
[1:13:41.680 --> 1:13:54.480]  and then there's all this trash and scum everywhere. See, they haven't cut my instincts out. I mean,
[1:13:54.480 --> 1:13:58.880]  I'm behaving normally. I've discovered there's a global criminal elite that's poisoning my water
[1:13:58.880 --> 1:14:04.880]  and my food. It's waging war on me and building a prison grid so they can orderly enslave or
[1:14:04.880 --> 1:14:14.080]  exterminate me and I'm pissed man. I'm angry. I'm upset. I'm worried. I can't quote enjoy my notoriety.
[1:14:14.080 --> 1:14:20.560]  I can't enjoy. You think I enjoy being Alex Jones? You think I enjoy being at the tip of the spear?
[1:14:23.920 --> 1:14:28.320]  Many years ago, I'm out of a little bit but I don't enjoy it now because I know it means
[1:14:28.320 --> 1:14:29.680]  nothing. It's an illusion.
[1:14:34.880 --> 1:14:38.480]  See, people want what they don't have. Once you've got it, you figure out it's not that good.
[1:14:43.360 --> 1:14:47.680]  I talked to a lot of people. They think Hollywood stars and famous people float around on clouds
[1:14:47.680 --> 1:14:55.200]  and live some different life and they do live a different life. People are obsessed with them and
[1:14:55.200 --> 1:15:01.520]  it's a cage and a lot of them get to where they realize it's all a big illusion and hate it
[1:15:01.520 --> 1:15:08.320]  and hate the fact that they're famous and just want to hide. But me, it's not like I'm some
[1:15:08.320 --> 1:15:19.680]  Hollywood star. No, I'm becoming a global cult icon. I don't think I live up to that when I see
[1:15:19.680 --> 1:15:25.600]  myself in hindsight and all it does is shove me further towards a collision with these sick
[1:15:25.600 --> 1:15:33.600]  New World Order freaks. Then I kind of selfishly in 3 a.m. wake up and think, man, why do I do
[1:15:33.600 --> 1:15:37.600]  this? But then I realize I have to make the sacrifice regardless because the New World
[1:15:37.600 --> 1:15:41.760]  Order was going to carry out their plans against me whether I ever woke up or not. So thank God,
[1:15:41.760 --> 1:15:46.960]  I know the truth. Then I think how selfish I am when I'm thinking about myself and thinking about
[1:15:46.960 --> 1:15:51.360]  what if I would have never gotten involved with all of this, but I didn't have any control of that.
[1:15:51.360 --> 1:16:01.840]  That was destiny. We're doing very important work here. This is a war and we're not perfect.
[1:16:01.840 --> 1:16:06.960]  We have a lot of problems, a lot of warts. But you know what? We mean good and we are doing the
[1:16:06.960 --> 1:16:14.160]  best we can and there's nobody fighting like us and if I do anything, I don't do it halfway.
[1:16:14.160 --> 1:16:19.520]  So I would just say it's up to you whether you want to support the Money Bomb. We have coming
[1:16:19.520 --> 1:16:27.200]  up. Let me go to infowars.com and see how many hours away we are central standard time to the
[1:16:27.200 --> 1:16:34.960]  Money Bomb. Starting tonight, we are 11 hours, 43 minutes, 25 seconds away from it starting.
[1:16:39.120 --> 1:16:43.040]  Well, there is a press release out by Paul Watson up on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[1:16:43.040 --> 1:16:47.280]  I hope you get it out to everybody. I'll be doing a special live show just on the internet
[1:16:47.280 --> 1:16:51.760]  streams at infowars.com from 8 to midnight tomorrow night.
[1:16:56.720 --> 1:17:02.480]  But I read this. Chered off Keen on Israeli airport security technology on the streets of America
[1:17:04.480 --> 1:17:09.040]  and it says that an Israeli company is going to get multi-billion-dollar contracts to run this
[1:17:09.040 --> 1:17:16.480]  on the streets of America. Then he mixes it in with the 500-mile border fence being built by
[1:17:16.480 --> 1:17:26.400]  illegal aliens. That's not a joke, by the way. It's such a hoax. Better chance of being struck
[1:17:26.400 --> 1:17:30.720]  by lightning than dying of terrorism even if you believe it's not government-sponsored.
[1:17:33.920 --> 1:17:38.320]  But our whole world, our whole life, trillions of dollars has got to go into these no-bid contracts
[1:17:38.320 --> 1:17:44.240]  domestically and trillions overseas to fight something imaginary. I mean, I saw on the news
[1:17:44.240 --> 1:17:48.480]  last night, I was watching TV late night, I just had to turn it on. I was watching MSNBC and they
[1:17:48.480 --> 1:17:54.320]  were announcing, I saw the article two years ago in the newswires about, yeah, White House is
[1:17:54.320 --> 1:18:00.960]  releasing info. Iran's definitely having secret summits with Al Qaeda. I mean, the way they insult
[1:18:00.960 --> 1:18:11.440]  your intelligence, the way they, it's so incredible to see a lie of that magnitude repeated daily.
[1:18:11.440 --> 1:18:16.800]  Iran is Shiite. The United States criminal government has destroyed our country's name
[1:18:16.800 --> 1:18:23.200]  and currency. It's not our government. For at least four years has been bombing, shooting,
[1:18:23.200 --> 1:18:29.360]  attacking police and military, schools, anything to elicit attacks back by the Iranians by the
[1:18:29.360 --> 1:18:35.280]  number three in Al Qaeda, known CIA operative. And the White House last year admitted it and
[1:18:35.280 --> 1:18:39.680]  put out a press release saying, yes, we're working with these three groups. Well, hobbyists out of
[1:18:39.680 --> 1:18:45.840]  Saudi Arabia. And then the media, I know I keep saying it. I can't believe the hoax of that magnitude.
[1:18:48.240 --> 1:18:53.520]  I just, how they talk to you like you're complete morons. And I guess you are because it works.
[1:18:53.520 --> 1:19:00.160]  Meanwhile, I got to have idiot Austin cops doing saturation patrols and checkpoints. And they'll,
[1:19:00.160 --> 1:19:06.720]  they'll tell you at the checkpoints, oh, we do this post 9 11. Just you, you understand,
[1:19:06.720 --> 1:19:10.720]  you work for a criminal system. You understand what you're doing is unamerican. You didn't do it
[1:19:10.720 --> 1:19:17.440]  before. Don't give me your bull. Don't come up to me when I got a wrong poll sign and tell me to
[1:19:17.440 --> 1:19:22.160]  get off the street corner. When there's a guy down the street with a sandwich board advertising
[1:19:22.160 --> 1:19:28.560]  some tax place. It's disgusting what you've become. It's disgusting what you do. You want to be ashamed
[1:19:28.560 --> 1:19:36.640]  of yourselves calling yourselves Americans. And that I'm a radical here on air saying we don't
[1:19:36.640 --> 1:19:42.080]  want domestic federal checkpoints and federally trained local police with mobile metal detector
[1:19:42.080 --> 1:19:52.960]  vans. I mean, this doesn't get any more Soviet Union, East Germany, communist China than that.
[1:19:52.960 --> 1:19:57.600]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson. Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't
[1:19:57.600 --> 1:20:04.400]  talk about gold for your IRA? That's right. Gold has been available to be placed in IRA since 1986.
[1:20:04.400 --> 1:20:09.840]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for
[1:20:09.840 --> 1:20:15.760]  your retirement. The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks,
[1:20:15.760 --> 1:20:22.240]  bonds, and CDs. Yet no word about IRAs. Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control
[1:20:22.240 --> 1:20:27.440]  of your assets by keeping you in paper. If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement,
[1:20:27.440 --> 1:20:34.080]  call 800-686-2237. Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper
[1:20:34.080 --> 1:20:43.760]  investments. Call 800-686-2237. Make sure that you secure your future. Call 800-686-2237.
[1:20:43.760 --> 1:20:55.040]  That's 1-800-686-2237. It is now time to reign in evil and bring them to justice.
[1:20:55.040 --> 1:21:00.000]  Through the authority that has been delegated to us, it is time to destroy the destroyers.
[1:21:00.000 --> 1:21:05.520]  The number of the mounted troops was 200 million, the vast majority of the population of the U.S.
[1:21:05.520 --> 1:21:10.480]  Though the people of the U.S. where their numbers and influence are strongest have primary responsibility
[1:21:10.480 --> 1:21:14.720]  for reigning the man and bringing them to justice, all nations will participate since
[1:21:14.720 --> 1:21:20.880]  they reside the world over. They are called Illuminati, elite, proponents of the New World Order.
[1:21:20.880 --> 1:21:25.680]  They oppose everything that is God and truth. They are of the line that was disinherited
[1:21:25.680 --> 1:21:30.800]  2,000 years ago. Everything they have built over the centuries, the wealth they have accumulated,
[1:21:30.800 --> 1:21:35.120]  the power they have established, the poisoning of the masses, the destruction of the earth
[1:21:35.120 --> 1:21:40.720]  and mankind, we will undo through the authority that has now been delegated to us. Visit our
[1:21:40.720 --> 1:21:49.600]  website at unveilingthem.com. That's U-N-V-E-I-L-I-N-G them.com. The message of His Kingdom.

[1:23:49.360 --> 1:24:02.880]  It's hard to start playing this song and not listening to the end.
[1:24:38.000 --> 1:24:38.880]  Johnny Beagle.
[1:24:40.960 --> 1:24:44.160]  He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack,
[1:24:44.160 --> 1:24:49.920]  most hip beneath the tree by the railroad track, bowling and everything such an endless shade,
[1:24:49.920 --> 1:24:55.280]  strumming with the rhythm that the drivers made. When people passing by, they were stopping to say,
[1:24:55.280 --> 1:25:01.600]  oh my, without a little country boy could play. Go, go, go, go, Johnny, go, go,
[1:25:01.600 --> 1:25:13.120]  go, go, Johnny, go, go, go, go, Johnny, go, go, go, Johnny Beagle.
[1:25:13.120 --> 1:25:29.760]  It's real simple what happened.
[1:25:36.080 --> 1:25:40.720]  About 100 years ago, the big money man said, hey, it's the age of science.
[1:25:40.720 --> 1:25:47.360]  Scientists tell us how to fully enslave the public forever so they can never revolt against us.
[1:25:47.360 --> 1:26:13.680]  When they said, okay, here's the answer. And they've done it.
[1:26:13.680 --> 1:26:19.280]  They have gotten the average person to tune out a reality. People just accept their car starts,
[1:26:19.920 --> 1:26:24.160]  they accept, they drive down the road, the grocery store has food, the cops are there in
[1:26:24.160 --> 1:26:29.440]  black uniforms stopping them, the illegal aliens are above the law. We've just all been trained
[1:26:29.440 --> 1:26:35.040]  to accept all of this. Scientists signed petition denying manmade global warming,
[1:26:35.040 --> 1:26:39.600]  more than 31,000 scientists have signed a petition denying that man is responsible for
[1:26:39.600 --> 1:26:44.400]  global warming. The European Union has responded by now attempting to pass a law saying it's
[1:26:44.400 --> 1:26:50.320]  illegal to deny it. Folks, this isn't a joke. This is tyranny. The academics,
[1:26:50.320 --> 1:26:54.960]  including 9,000 with PhDs claim that greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane are
[1:26:54.960 --> 1:26:59.840]  actually beneficial for the environment. Well, of course they are. Four things drive
[1:26:59.840 --> 1:27:06.640]  planetary life cycle, oxygen, carbon dioxide, solar radiation in all of its bandwidths and
[1:27:06.640 --> 1:27:15.840]  different forms, all its wavelengths and of course water. Doesn't matter because Mr.
[1:27:15.840 --> 1:27:21.040]  Chertoff is going to have foreign intelligence agencies running security in the US as a good
[1:27:21.040 --> 1:27:28.160]  Mossad officer. What is the definition of a coup d'etat? It is a small criminal group within the
[1:27:28.160 --> 1:27:35.440]  government who then rapidly take over the rest of the government. I saw a better exact definition of
[1:27:35.440 --> 1:27:42.480]  that just the other day. I do not think Israel is the only player in all of this. The British
[1:27:42.480 --> 1:27:46.640]  Anglo-American establishment is dominant, but I have to call a spade a spade. I mean,
[1:27:47.200 --> 1:27:50.320]  when they're moving in all these Mossad agents into every power position,
[1:27:52.160 --> 1:28:00.800]  Homeland Security had Attorney General. When they are doing things like that,
[1:28:00.800 --> 1:28:08.960]  it gets very, very serious. Homeland Security had Chertoff, you've got McKasey over there,
[1:28:09.920 --> 1:28:14.320]  and they're saying these Israeli companies which are Mossad are going to be running the domestic
[1:28:14.320 --> 1:28:21.360]  checkpoints. I mean, that is just unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen. In commanding our local
[1:28:21.360 --> 1:28:25.440]  police, the ADL has already done this where they give them all these fake dossiers and demonize
[1:28:25.440 --> 1:28:31.840]  every group, and it's just unspeakable. Let me type coup d'etat into Google at the definition.
[1:28:33.040 --> 1:28:43.600]  Coup d'etat, I'm spelling that right. I am so dumb that I'm not even spelling it right.
[1:28:45.920 --> 1:28:48.560]  Let me try to look it up here. I probably shouldn't do this on air. We'll just do that
[1:28:48.560 --> 1:28:57.520]  when we come back after the break as I can't seem to think, type and talk at the same time while
[1:28:57.520 --> 1:29:05.760]  I'm on air. But I'll dig up a good definition of a coup d'etat. I basically gave you the
[1:29:10.960 --> 1:29:17.840]  definition for it. I found it. A coup consists of the infiltration of a small but critical
[1:29:17.840 --> 1:29:24.000]  segment of the state apparatus which is then used to displace the government from its control of
[1:29:24.000 --> 1:29:30.080]  the remainder. There's a coup d'etat going on in the United States. There's no doubt that a
[1:29:31.280 --> 1:29:36.400]  small group has infiltrated a critical segment of the state apparatus which is then being used
[1:29:36.400 --> 1:29:43.440]  to displace the government from its control of the remainder. We're on the march, the empires on the
[1:29:43.440 --> 1:29:52.560]  run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. The Federal Trade Commission estimates that
[1:29:52.560 --> 1:29:57.200]  nine million Americans are victims of identity theft each year. The crime of identity theft
[1:29:57.200 --> 1:30:03.440]  occurs every 3.5 seconds costing the victims an average of $8,000. If you own a PC, passwords

[1:30:50.960 --> 1:30:58.960]  It is a big idea, a new world order. In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful
[1:30:58.960 --> 1:31:05.760]  world government. It's known as the Bilderberg. Could their objective be world domination?
[1:31:05.760 --> 1:31:11.840]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the new world order,
[1:31:11.840 --> 1:31:16.320]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[1:31:19.280 --> 1:31:24.720]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.

[1:33:12.480 --> 1:33:41.840]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to your life. There's no turning back.
[1:33:42.480 --> 1:33:48.240]  You were born and you will surely die. What are you going to build? What are you going to create?
[1:33:49.440 --> 1:33:54.640]  Are you ever going to find out what really living is all about? It's not about just consuming.
[1:33:56.560 --> 1:34:01.200]  But the establishments told us not to consume. They're going to control what we can consume,
[1:34:01.200 --> 1:34:05.120]  what we can build, what we can say. They're going to have bureaucrats in our daily lives.
[1:34:05.120 --> 1:34:08.320]  You're going to have to swipe a card to buy and sell. It will track your entire history
[1:34:08.320 --> 1:34:14.080]  of purchases and your, quote, carbon footprint. I read at least eight years ago in Club of
[1:34:14.080 --> 1:34:17.920]  Rome documents, U.N. Biological Diversity Assessments. We would all have a card.
[1:34:19.040 --> 1:34:23.120]  It would assess our carbon footprint. It will surveil and track everything we do globally.
[1:34:24.080 --> 1:34:29.360]  We will then have to have how many credits we have and then pay taxes into private,
[1:34:29.360 --> 1:34:32.720]  global, central banks, Federal Reserve, Bank of England, and others,
[1:34:32.720 --> 1:34:38.240]  just like Federal Express calls itself federal. It's not federal. And they will run your entire
[1:34:38.240 --> 1:34:44.240]  life. You will have bureaucrats in your home on a weekly basis. You will have neighborhood captains
[1:34:45.040 --> 1:34:49.200]  who are paid a paltry amount by the local government to inspect you. You will go to jail,
[1:34:49.200 --> 1:34:55.280]  not just be fined if the wrong kind of trash is in your rubbish bin. This is not my opinion.
[1:34:55.280 --> 1:35:02.400]  I told you all this years ago and now it's all being put in. It's just, it is hell on earth.
[1:35:02.400 --> 1:35:08.080]  Total control of everything. Global taxation regulation. Earlier we played a little clip
[1:35:08.080 --> 1:35:16.000]  from BBC where Austin Williams wrote the book, The Enemies of Progress, The Dangerous Sustainability,
[1:35:18.480 --> 1:35:24.080]  and he was on a program with a guy we've got coming up Monday who is pushing the global
[1:35:24.080 --> 1:35:29.760]  carbon credit and carbon tax and who they say came up with the idea in 1990. No, this professor
[1:35:29.760 --> 1:35:36.240]  popularized it. It was in 1964 and 68 Club of Rome documents. They claimed then, though,
[1:35:36.240 --> 1:35:40.800]  that carbon was going to cause ice age. But then they switched and said, well, they said,
[1:35:40.800 --> 1:35:43.680]  they said there's a problem. People are going to figure out that it's normal. There's climate
[1:35:43.680 --> 1:35:49.760]  change. So we need to say both. So whenever it freezes, we say it's the earth and our CO2. And
[1:35:49.760 --> 1:35:55.200]  then whenever it heats up, we can say both and the people don't have enough memory. They say
[1:35:55.200 --> 1:35:59.360]  all this. They admit it's a con job. Richard N. Haas, the head of the CFR, I've read this several
[1:35:59.360 --> 1:36:05.280]  times last month, says it's a way for the state to wage war on the individual. It is neo feudalism.
[1:36:06.560 --> 1:36:13.040]  And it is a way to have a monopoly. And it is hell on earth. This is the global government.
[1:36:13.680 --> 1:36:19.120]  And here to give us his take on all of that is The Enemies of Progress author, Austin Williams.
[1:36:20.960 --> 1:36:26.800]  And of the book, they say a much needed diagnosis of the bleak anti-human pathology
[1:36:26.800 --> 1:36:30.960]  described as environmentalism, Dominic Lawson, columnist for the London Independent,
[1:36:31.520 --> 1:36:36.960]  a very persuasive contribution by a thoughtful subversive. That's right. They're talking about
[1:36:36.960 --> 1:36:43.360]  arresting people that say this now in Europe. Professor Frank Ferdy, author of The Politics
[1:36:43.360 --> 1:36:48.400]  of Fear and Where Have All the Intellectuals Gone. Another one here is Austin Williams is a gift
[1:36:48.400 --> 1:36:56.400]  for lobbying well-directed grenades. And that's the author of Immigrant Your Country Needs Them.
[1:36:56.400 --> 1:37:03.760]  Okay. So we'll go ahead and talk to the author. Mr. Williams, thanks for coming on with us.
[1:37:03.760 --> 1:37:07.920]  No problem, Alex. How are you? Good. That little three minute rant you heard. That's
[1:37:07.920 --> 1:37:12.080]  my analysis. I've made a film about this called Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement with
[1:37:12.080 --> 1:37:15.840]  all their admissions. A, do you agree with what I said? And B, do you want to elaborate on it?
[1:37:16.720 --> 1:37:24.400]  Well, I do when I don't. I mean, I think that you had a... I like your style and I like the fact
[1:37:24.400 --> 1:37:29.200]  that very few people are critical of this, especially in Europe. It's really refreshing to
[1:37:29.200 --> 1:37:34.800]  hear a rant of that magnitude. So thank you for that. Where I perhaps don't necessarily agree
[1:37:34.800 --> 1:37:39.040]  with you totally, and it's probably because I think it's even more insidious than the way you
[1:37:39.040 --> 1:37:44.800]  pause it, is that I don't think this is necessarily big government or insidious state monitoring
[1:37:44.800 --> 1:37:50.320]  issue. I think this has become much more self-regulatory. It certainly has in Europe and in
[1:37:50.320 --> 1:37:56.400]  parts of, of Australasia, where people are actually taking this on board. Now, you don't have to have
[1:37:56.400 --> 1:38:01.840]  a camera in your bin to tell you how much rubbish you've thrown out, even though we do in London
[1:38:01.840 --> 1:38:08.960]  have cameras in our bins. The fact is that we now sort of feel guilty. We have taken this on board
[1:38:08.960 --> 1:38:12.240]  as a court. But sir, that's the grassroots brainwashing. Let me just ask you, because you're
[1:38:12.240 --> 1:38:17.440]  very well informed. I've scanned over your book. Have you read the Club of Rum documents? I have.
[1:38:17.440 --> 1:38:23.600]  Okay. So you, and you've read the World Bank IMF discussions and the different policy reports.
[1:38:23.600 --> 1:38:27.920]  They said they would make a new religion that we needed a religion. Yeah. And this is the
[1:38:27.920 --> 1:38:33.440]  religion of hating ourselves and basically having one child policy. So I agree that the low-level
[1:38:33.440 --> 1:38:38.960]  cult members have been brainwashed over 50 years, but at the top it is the private banks. It is,
[1:38:39.600 --> 1:38:43.680]  they are the ones that engineered it. Well, I mean, I'm not suggesting that, you know, the
[1:38:43.680 --> 1:38:48.880]  state has lost all control. I mean, it's a fairly insidious state of power relations that we have
[1:38:48.880 --> 1:38:53.360]  across the world. So, you know, I agree with you that people do think up all sorts of kind of weird
[1:38:53.360 --> 1:38:58.720]  and wonderful and weird and terrible scenarios and then implement them. That I agree with.
[1:38:58.720 --> 1:39:03.840]  However, all I'm trying to say is I just think that what's happening, take Britain for an example,
[1:39:03.840 --> 1:39:06.960]  and it's very, very different to what's going on in America. I appreciate that. But generally,
[1:39:06.960 --> 1:39:14.080]  there isn't a really heavy-handed, state-intrusive, authoritarian policy, which actually finds people
[1:39:14.080 --> 1:39:18.080]  and locks people up and all the rest of it. It looks to an outsider. It looks very hands-off.
[1:39:18.640 --> 1:39:23.840]  But actually, people are regulating themselves because they have bought into not the fact that
[1:39:23.840 --> 1:39:28.320]  they fear being arrested, but more the fact they've bought into this notion that, you know,
[1:39:28.320 --> 1:39:32.000]  environmentalism, you know, we're all going to hell in a handcart, that the world's going to
[1:39:32.000 --> 1:39:36.240]  falling apart. And they are to blame. Now, this is the thing you see. I think whether you want
[1:39:36.240 --> 1:39:40.160]  to call that brainwashing from the top or whether you want to see it as basically accepting of a
[1:39:40.160 --> 1:39:45.280]  general, you know, one-track philosophy from the bottom, I think that people have just bought
[1:39:45.280 --> 1:39:51.920]  into this idea that that's all there is, is the earth. We are humans now see themselves as being
[1:39:51.920 --> 1:39:55.920]  the problem, which is a fundamental difference to what's ever gone before, where humans have
[1:39:55.920 --> 1:40:00.480]  always seen themselves as being creative and solutions to the world. And we now see ourselves
[1:40:00.480 --> 1:40:05.520]  as somehow detrimental to the planet. And therefore, you then have to rein in what would otherwise
[1:40:05.520 --> 1:40:08.800]  have been called creative activity. Now, we see that as being actually detrimental.
[1:40:08.800 --> 1:40:13.600]  Yeah, it's a new dark age, and the elite are going to build technological spires above us.
[1:40:14.480 --> 1:40:17.760]  Under national security that we're not even aware of, this is our own statements,
[1:40:17.760 --> 1:40:24.640]  we will live in the suppressed kind of loincloth, you know, going back to nature existence. And
[1:40:24.640 --> 1:40:30.160]  this is a false template, false programming that they have given us. And it comes directly from
[1:40:30.160 --> 1:40:32.320]  the elite it's been engineered in through the universities.
[1:40:32.320 --> 1:40:36.560]  Well, I mean, again, there's a section in the book which actually looks at, you know,
[1:40:36.560 --> 1:40:43.120]  the insidious level of educational misinformation and how they are teaching children to be afraid
[1:40:43.120 --> 1:40:49.360]  of the future. And therefore, they will automatically pester their parents in their
[1:40:49.360 --> 1:40:54.400]  profligate ways. So you have children coming home now telling parents to turn their television
[1:40:54.400 --> 1:40:58.720]  standbys off, to drive more slowly, not to buy another car, you name it.
[1:40:58.720 --> 1:41:03.440]  And that's what Al Gore is doing with his 100 million tattletail squad. These are going to be
[1:41:03.440 --> 1:41:08.720]  the new, they say the new brigades, and you have young people all over Austin popping the tires
[1:41:08.720 --> 1:41:14.080]  of SUVs, knocking their windows out. I've seen them do it. They're running around, foaming at the
[1:41:14.080 --> 1:41:20.800]  mouth, and I'm telling you, it's all engineered, I can prove it. Well, I'm more than happy to
[1:41:20.800 --> 1:41:25.120]  agree. I mean, I don't mind whether that's the truth on one side of it. All I'm trying to say is
[1:41:25.120 --> 1:41:30.480]  I think that it's a little bit more, um, for me, um, the fact that there is no alternative
[1:41:31.040 --> 1:41:36.960]  perspective, we, we, I mean, my book is, is a rant in itself. So I, you know, I, I like this kind
[1:41:36.960 --> 1:41:42.960]  of presentational style, but generally I think that what's missing is a political critique
[1:41:42.960 --> 1:41:46.720]  of why it's happening, how it's happening and really what the alternative position is. Yeah,
[1:41:46.720 --> 1:41:51.120]  we don't have trillions of dollars of funding like the big banks do. This is a way to tax what we
[1:41:51.120 --> 1:41:57.680]  breathe, to tax all of the four inputs of life, carbon dioxide, uh, oxygen, uh, solar radiation
[1:41:57.680 --> 1:42:01.840]  and water. And this is total control. And they admit that. I mean, if you've read Club of Rome
[1:42:01.840 --> 1:42:06.720]  and you've read other documents, you know, they admit this is a total control system. Oh yeah,
[1:42:06.720 --> 1:42:10.560]  I mean, what is Club of Rome in 74 said it as well? Do you mean they were basically saying we have to
[1:42:10.560 --> 1:42:15.280]  find, uh, a, a policy which will unite people because obviously they were really, were very
[1:42:15.280 --> 1:42:18.960]  well aware. Yeah, that's Richard Haas saying the people will be the enemy. Yeah. No, exactly,
[1:42:18.960 --> 1:42:23.520]  exactly. And so, you know, and you also have this situation where Malthusianism is coming back,
[1:42:23.520 --> 1:42:29.040]  where we now see people as being, there's too many people. Eugenics. Eugenics is, is everywhere.
[1:42:29.040 --> 1:42:34.560]  And it's a, it's a, it's a very, very, uh, dispiriting, but fascinating historical period in
[1:42:34.560 --> 1:42:37.840]  which. And that allows the elite to suppress everything we're going to develop, everything
[1:42:37.840 --> 1:42:43.360]  we're going to do and have total control, a new dark age, get into, uh, who's driving this, who's
[1:42:43.360 --> 1:42:48.160]  behind it, what they're trying to push. Well, I accept you say that my faith in humanity is such
[1:42:48.160 --> 1:42:53.920]  that I think that people, the beauty of humanity is, is that we will not necessarily be kept down.
[1:42:53.920 --> 1:42:59.440]  We will still want more. Uh, we still want better, more convenient things. We still want
[1:42:59.440 --> 1:43:03.600]  improvements in our daily lives and people are striving for that. Now, whether it's the peasants
[1:43:03.600 --> 1:43:08.240]  of China going to the special economic zones, or whether it's, you know, people in, in Britain who
[1:43:08.240 --> 1:43:12.480]  are actually kind of campaigning against, uh, their, their jobs being lost because of the carbon
[1:43:12.480 --> 1:43:18.560]  cuts. Um, you know, there, there's a general recognition that people are not there to be, uh,
[1:43:18.560 --> 1:43:22.160]  to, to generally lie down and accept these. That's right. The farmers and the fishermen
[1:43:22.160 --> 1:43:26.560]  are now rioting all over to Europe, especially France. Overall of this, your government's
[1:43:26.560 --> 1:43:32.640]  proposing wartime style rationing. Yeah. Uh, I mean, describe what's happening in,
[1:43:32.640 --> 1:43:36.240]  in your country and in Europe for people here in the U S. Well, I mean, there's that level of
[1:43:36.240 --> 1:43:41.200]  kind of political posturing and rhetoric, which is basically any number of politicians
[1:43:41.200 --> 1:43:47.520]  now regularly cite the second world war. They basically look at, uh, two things. One is historic
[1:43:47.520 --> 1:43:52.640]  appeasement where people give into Hitler in the early thirties and they are then therefore
[1:43:52.640 --> 1:43:58.800]  likening anybody who has a climate change in verdict commerce. Denier, uh, is likened now to,
[1:43:58.800 --> 1:44:02.800]  uh, Nazis, uh, Nazi lovers. Uh, and there's this kind of general acceptance that, uh,
[1:44:02.800 --> 1:44:08.080]  what we need is a war economy, not just to bring in rationing, but also to clamp down on any
[1:44:08.080 --> 1:44:13.440]  oppositional viewpoints. Um, and, and obviously the, the, the joke is, is that people who did
[1:44:13.440 --> 1:44:18.080]  fight fascism back in the thirties were fighting, uh, you know, and accepting rationing on the
[1:44:18.080 --> 1:44:23.600]  understanding that when they beat the Nazis, uh, life would get better. There would be more.
[1:44:23.600 --> 1:44:28.720]  This was, but what's being proposed now is that we can have a war economy, which is perpetual,
[1:44:28.720 --> 1:44:32.640]  which never ends where we constantly, uh, against ourselves.
[1:44:32.640 --> 1:44:36.480]  Against ourselves. Exactly. Well, we see the thing is that the notion is that we are the
[1:44:36.480 --> 1:44:41.600]  problem. Humanity is the problem. We have caused this problem. Uh, and I think that is
[1:44:41.600 --> 1:44:46.560]  kind of historically, uh, never been seen before. Uh, that is the, for me, the ultimate
[1:44:46.560 --> 1:44:51.360]  danger of this whole discussion to, to see that, you know, human creativity is now being turned
[1:44:51.360 --> 1:44:56.800]  on its head to be seen as human destructiveness. Uh, and that's, I mean, I don't think that's got
[1:44:56.800 --> 1:45:02.320]  intellectual, uh, legs. I mean, I don't think it'll, it'll stand and walk, but generally I think
[1:45:02.320 --> 1:45:08.720]  that we've gotten no other argument against it at the moment. So for me, the beauty is to start
[1:45:08.720 --> 1:45:13.440]  arguing, start critiquing. Well, you talk about how it isn't a police state yet, but in Europe,
[1:45:13.440 --> 1:45:17.920]  they're trying to pass laws and saying that climate change denial should be a restable offense.
[1:45:17.920 --> 1:45:23.920]  They're talking about it in England. Uh, we know that I, I've seen where they are giving people
[1:45:23.920 --> 1:45:29.600]  500, uh, pound fines, 250 pound fines. That's like a thousand dollars here in the U S ladies and
[1:45:29.600 --> 1:45:33.840]  gentlemen, uh, for having the wrong thing in their rubbish bin or too much or putting it out 20
[1:45:33.840 --> 1:45:39.680]  minutes early. Also, uh, they come to your door and have you sign a pledge that you take responsibility
[1:45:39.680 --> 1:45:45.440]  that you, that you'll be arrested. Uh, if you do things wrong and, and I've read the documents,
[1:45:45.440 --> 1:45:49.600]  they're going to have neighborhood squads. It's already happened. San Francisco is doing it.
[1:45:49.600 --> 1:45:53.520]  Other area. I mean, this is hell on earth. Yeah. No, I mean, are you right? I mean, it is happening.
[1:45:53.520 --> 1:45:57.600]  I'm not, I'm not suggesting for one minute that the state has become somehow, uh, you know, operating
[1:45:57.600 --> 1:46:02.400]  with kid gloves. It is going around. I mean, the guy was prosecuted only last week for actually
[1:46:02.400 --> 1:46:08.720]  having his, uh, bin, a lid open. It was open because he puts too much rubbish in it and he
[1:46:08.720 --> 1:46:14.320]  couldn't close the lid. There was a fella eating and his, uh, his apple core fell at the table and
[1:46:14.320 --> 1:46:20.480]  the cops were watching like attack dogs and ran over and arrested him. Yeah. No, I mean, there's,
[1:46:20.480 --> 1:46:26.160]  there are more than too many mad stories like that. Well, we already have it in the U S. Let's
[1:46:26.160 --> 1:46:31.200]  see. Let me tell you about it. The wind blows and your bread blows off. You're going to jail.
[1:46:31.200 --> 1:46:35.840]  Okay. Your child lays their head down in school. They're going to prison. This is the new system.
[1:46:35.840 --> 1:46:40.480]  I've got all their documents, Mr. Williams. No, I agree. They are gonna mega rape us. No, no, no.
[1:46:40.480 --> 1:46:46.160]  I think I mean, obviously the three strikes now, uh, which is over here now is, uh, quite insidious,
[1:46:46.160 --> 1:46:52.480]  uh, uh, terrible, uh, legislative, um, maneuver. Um, but I agree with you that actually there's
[1:46:52.480 --> 1:46:56.320]  an awful lot of kind of what would have been called and well, they wouldn't have been called crimes
[1:46:56.320 --> 1:47:00.480]  in the past. Would they over here? And I think you've got it over there as well. Anti social
[1:47:00.480 --> 1:47:05.760]  behavior is now, uh, you can be locked up for it. Well, they got to fill the presence with somebody.
[1:47:05.760 --> 1:47:13.200]  Now, now let's go back here. Uh, we've got 31,000 scientists, 9,000 of them with PhD saying that
[1:47:13.200 --> 1:47:17.920]  carbon dioxide is good for the earth that we've had as high as 14 times higher carbon dioxide
[1:47:17.920 --> 1:47:22.800]  that actually it reverses, uh, uh, the desert spreading a desert vacation. Yeah. And of course,
[1:47:22.800 --> 1:47:28.400]  that's the real science. Yeah. And, uh, I mean, this is big news. Yeah. Well, I mean, it's one
[1:47:28.400 --> 1:47:34.080]  of those things, isn't it? That's, uh, actually, um, because, uh, climate change and global warming,
[1:47:34.080 --> 1:47:39.920]  whatever you want to call it, um, plays a function within a state as a kind of a coherent idea.
[1:47:39.920 --> 1:47:45.200]  It's the only remaining ideology left. Um, it's the one that we therefore have to cling to.
[1:47:45.200 --> 1:47:48.400]  Uh, I don't mean, I don't mean I do, but you know, generally the way the state and the,
[1:47:48.400 --> 1:47:51.200]  and society operates. No, that's what the elite says. You're right. I mean,
[1:47:51.200 --> 1:47:55.120]  the, the, what we're saying is not our opinion here. Go ahead. Yeah. No, sorry. I'm also,
[1:47:55.120 --> 1:47:59.760]  we're, we're in agreement to luxury here. I mean, I think that ultimately it is the only game in
[1:47:59.760 --> 1:48:06.240]  town climate change. Uh, and therefore to rubbish it, to critique it, to argue against it is then
[1:48:06.240 --> 1:48:12.400]  seen as somehow being, uh, sectarian or subversive. Uh, and that obviously can't be, uh, accountants.
[1:48:12.400 --> 1:48:16.400]  So I think that, uh, you know, there is a, there was a bigger kind of a unifying game here being
[1:48:16.400 --> 1:48:20.800]  played by the stakes. Well, sir, you are very prominent and, and, and respected. You talked
[1:48:20.800 --> 1:48:25.120]  to a lot of people. Let me tell you the game plan, my plan to defeat them. It's the truth.
[1:48:25.120 --> 1:48:30.320]  The truth is always the ultimate weapon. Good. There is real environmental degradation without
[1:48:30.320 --> 1:48:36.080]  of control cross species genetic engineering. Yeah. We know that is already causing major
[1:48:36.080 --> 1:48:40.240]  problems and already jumping into funguses that are killing most of the oak trees in many areas
[1:48:40.240 --> 1:48:45.040]  of the country here in the U S. We already know there's a lot of serious environmentalism, toxic
[1:48:45.040 --> 1:48:50.800]  waste dumping. We need to demand and show that big corporations have agreed to make it carbon dioxide
[1:48:50.800 --> 1:48:55.840]  because they can tax it, get some of the corporate welfare and, and that way everybody's diverted
[1:48:55.840 --> 1:49:00.560]  off of a real grassroots environmental movement onto something that is, you know, that isn't a
[1:49:00.560 --> 1:49:05.840]  real problem instead of all the real problems. And so we need to point out that not only is it
[1:49:05.840 --> 1:49:11.920]  a mass hoax, but that it is taking attention away from real environmental crises and things that do
[1:49:11.920 --> 1:49:16.480]  need laws. Now that is how we will crush the enemy because you can't take the religion of the
[1:49:16.480 --> 1:49:21.280]  environment away, which has a lot of, you know, things that make sense at its base, but not at
[1:49:21.280 --> 1:49:26.400]  what the elite plan to do. Then you've defeated the enemy. That way you take away their stuffed
[1:49:26.400 --> 1:49:32.640]  animal and give them another one, but you give them a toy, a bedtime snuggle that, that actually
[1:49:32.640 --> 1:49:36.880]  helps the earth. Yeah. I mean, I think that's, I mean, it's interesting when you say that, because
[1:49:36.880 --> 1:49:41.760]  in, in the Chinese example, you know, there's a big discussion about the desertification of China,
[1:49:42.320 --> 1:49:47.200]  obviously due to kind of Mao's terrible environmental social policies over, over 50 years.
[1:49:47.200 --> 1:49:52.080]  But actually what we forget is, is that one third of China is desert and always has been.
[1:49:52.080 --> 1:49:56.480]  And secondly, is that the government now as part of a new environmental strategy is actually
[1:49:56.480 --> 1:50:03.760]  decanting, evicting 11, 15,000 people from their villages to plant trees to stop the desert. So
[1:50:03.760 --> 1:50:10.320]  I mean, there's no, there's, if we just take the headline figure of people are being, are being
[1:50:10.320 --> 1:50:15.120]  evicted, isn't it terrible? Isn't this a kind of sign of the way that the desertification and the
[1:50:15.120 --> 1:50:20.400]  terrible environmental policies that are impacting on humanity, then actually, you know, it sounds
[1:50:20.400 --> 1:50:23.920]  terrible, but nobody ever says that the other way around that environmental policies have the same
[1:50:23.920 --> 1:50:29.520]  sort of effect. Stay there, sir. One more five minute segment. Talk about your book, How People
[1:50:29.520 --> 1:50:35.600]  Get It. Amazing information, ladies and gentlemen, Austin Williams, the enemies of progress. They're
[1:50:35.600 --> 1:50:39.760]  not the enemies of progress. They're the enemies of our progress. They're going to control all
[1:50:39.760 --> 1:50:46.160]  progress. Literally, the bureaucrats becoming God with a pack of religious minions running around
[1:50:46.160 --> 1:50:53.840]  slicing your tires. Soon there'll be police officers. Did you know the accumulation of acidic
[1:50:53.840 --> 1:50:58.480]  waste in the body is the single largest cause of disease such as cancer or diabetes? Acidic
[1:50:58.480 --> 1:51:03.200]  waste is created by the types of food we eat, what we drink, the environment, and our high stress
[1:51:03.200 --> 1:51:08.160]  lifestyles. It's these choices that cause decreased energy, weight gain, and eventually disease.
[1:51:08.160 --> 1:51:13.360]  The easiest way to reduce disease causing acidic waste is by drinking alkaline ionized water.

[1:54:00.880 --> 1:54:06.080]  I'm not joking. They've totally brainwashed most of the children in the public government training
[1:54:06.080 --> 1:54:12.480]  camps. When I was in public school, it was all anti-human. We'd play spaceship, life boat, decide
[1:54:12.480 --> 1:54:16.640]  who had to die. They'd say, okay, we've got to have a policeman, got to have a scientist, got to
[1:54:16.640 --> 1:54:21.760]  have a, oh, you're a car maker. Those are bad. You're going to die. So they've had simulated
[1:54:21.760 --> 1:54:27.680]  eugenics death drills. China's the model that's going globally. And it's in all their official
[1:54:27.680 --> 1:54:33.280]  documents. It's in my film, in-game blueprint for global enslavement. And they're coming for us.
[1:54:33.280 --> 1:54:37.200]  And I mean, I was down at Zilker Park a few weeks ago, took off one day, took my kids down to ride
[1:54:37.200 --> 1:54:43.760]  the, my children down to ride the train. And I saw several SUVs with their tire slit when it's
[1:54:43.760 --> 1:54:48.960]  knocked out. One of them had its alarm going off. And I hear about it all the time. They just run
[1:54:48.960 --> 1:54:53.920]  around scatting tires bashing in. And a lot of them are going to become the new Enviro cops and
[1:54:53.920 --> 1:54:59.840]  heaven help you when they get you. Because you're a bad human that needs to die. And Dr. Eric Bianca,
[1:54:59.840 --> 1:55:05.120]  UT, you know, got a standing ovation, the Federation of Scientists. And he was broadcast
[1:55:05.120 --> 1:55:09.600]  red skulls on the walls and said 90% of us need to be killed. And there was a three-minute standing
[1:55:09.600 --> 1:55:14.720]  ovation with tears in people's eyes, according to eyewitnesses in the newspaper. So understand
[1:55:14.720 --> 1:55:19.360]  the vast majority. You want to start killing immediately. And I don't know if you want to
[1:55:19.360 --> 1:55:23.520]  get that extreme, sir, but I have all the documentation. Are you aware of the hardcore
[1:55:23.520 --> 1:55:28.000]  extinctionist movement? Mr. Williams?
[1:55:28.000 --> 1:55:35.120]  Williams? Yeah, the phone system just blipped. Okay. Well, we don't even need him anymore.
[1:55:35.120 --> 1:55:39.200]  Pointless. The point is, he went on the show. He admitted what was going on. He talked about
[1:55:39.200 --> 1:55:44.560]  what was happening. And he understands that it's a giant scam of cult members and that the children
[1:55:44.560 --> 1:55:49.040]  who come home and boss the parents around. The state is turning your children against you.
[1:55:50.240 --> 1:55:53.520]  Don't call him back. It's fine. I already had him on. I know 50 times more. I mean,
[1:55:53.520 --> 1:55:59.520]  the whole point here is that, I just wanted to plug him because his book's good,
[1:56:02.880 --> 1:56:08.480]  that they are taking your children from you. I have seen two different time magazines for kids
[1:56:08.480 --> 1:56:13.360]  that are given out in all public schools in the U.S. The first time I saw it was eight years ago,
[1:56:13.360 --> 1:56:18.000]  about six years ago, I saw another edition. And it said, your parents don't know the future. Your
[1:56:18.000 --> 1:56:23.680]  parents don't understand. They're not cool and stylish like you. They don't want to take microchips.
[1:56:23.680 --> 1:56:27.200]  You understand they're trying to take your kids from you. You understand they're turning your
[1:56:27.200 --> 1:56:32.960]  children against you. Have you lost all your instincts to be angry with them, to realize what
[1:56:32.960 --> 1:56:43.840]  they've done, to realize what's going on? You understand that the human extinctionist movement,
[1:56:43.840 --> 1:56:52.320]  the eugenesis movement, all of this is growing and getting more and more powerful. It has
[1:56:52.320 --> 1:56:59.840]  massive funding and support. Somehow we've got to activate our humanity. We've got to realize
[1:56:59.840 --> 1:57:13.600]  we're not the enemy. We're the solution. We've got to do it now. I am just totally angry about
[1:57:13.600 --> 1:57:17.520]  what's happening. And you know what? I'm probably too angry sometimes, but at least I'm angry.
[1:57:17.520 --> 1:57:22.720]  Some people, I don't know how you could know this was going on and not take action against it every
[1:57:22.720 --> 1:57:32.160]  way you can imagine. And one way is the infowars money bomb. I salute you and I
[1:57:33.920 --> 1:57:39.040]  promise you my word that we will spend 100% of the money against the New World Order.
[1:57:39.040 --> 1:57:47.600]  The money from it won't even go so much as lunch at this office because that's where I want to put
[1:57:47.600 --> 1:57:56.960]  my money anyways. So infowars money bomb coming up. Infowars money bomb coming up
[1:57:57.760 --> 1:58:07.520]  in about 10 hours at infowars.com. PayPal, credit card, or you can call us as well.
[1:58:07.520 --> 1:58:11.440]  We'll be one 800 number up there in the next few hours. It doesn't start till midnight tonight
[1:58:11.440 --> 1:58:16.160]  and there'll be people there at midnight. Central standard time to take your calls.
[1:58:16.960 --> 1:58:20.080]  There'll only be two people here. So if you call and it's busy, I hope we have that problem.
[1:58:20.080 --> 1:58:22.240]  Just call right back or leave your number. We'll call you right back.
[1:58:22.960 --> 1:58:26.320]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we'll be right back on the other side of this quick break. Stay with
[1:58:26.320 --> 1:58:37.280]  me. Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com

[2:00:02.720 --> 2:00:18.480]  network. And now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:24.640 --> 2:00:29.200]  Now into our number three. Eric Nords from joining us in the next segment.
[2:00:29.200 --> 2:00:36.480]  And then I've got a Deputy Air Pollution Control Officer from Major U.S. City joining us to talk
[2:00:36.480 --> 2:00:43.680]  about the new greenhouse gas taxes, the new carbon footprint, the beginning of your enslavement.
[2:00:45.440 --> 2:00:51.440]  So that's coming up in one hour. I got a lot of news here that I haven't gotten to, but the most
[2:00:51.440 --> 2:00:57.600]  incredible story of the day is Reuters Chertoff, Israeli run company to command feds and police with
[2:00:57.600 --> 2:01:05.520]  domestic checkpoints. I mean, it's just, it's just unbelievable. I mean, he really is Mossad.
[2:01:06.160 --> 2:01:08.560]  Chertoff's mother really is the founder of Mossad.
[2:01:11.920 --> 2:01:16.560]  And I just have a problem with felons, foreigners, illegal aliens being our military, our police.
[2:01:17.680 --> 2:01:23.360]  And it really is true that a lot of leadership positions are being staffed, not just with Israelis.
[2:01:23.360 --> 2:01:28.880]  But, and there's no such thing as dual loyalty, folks. These people work for Israel. They're,
[2:01:28.880 --> 2:01:32.400]  they're here to work for Israel. They're allowed to go back to Israel when they commit crimes.
[2:01:34.160 --> 2:01:39.040]  It's like a base camp where, where nobody else has a place they can run, but Israel,
[2:01:39.040 --> 2:01:43.120]  and then it's just, it's invincible. You can do whatever you want, just go back to Israel,
[2:01:43.120 --> 2:01:50.320]  and it's just shameful. But Chertoff said they also want to have Homeland Security
[2:01:50.320 --> 2:01:54.960]  roving teams in public places. And then you go into the federal plans, it's malls, streets,
[2:01:54.960 --> 2:02:00.240]  everywhere. And quote, with Israelis training them how to spot terrorists and how people who
[2:02:00.240 --> 2:02:06.160]  look suspicious in off your eye movement and just all this quackery. And then they claim that gets
[2:02:06.160 --> 2:02:13.120]  around the fourth amendment. It's just, look, I'm getting sick of secret police and I'm getting
[2:02:13.120 --> 2:02:19.120]  sick of you on American trash. Just stay away from me. Okay. Your bosses ship in the drugs,
[2:02:19.120 --> 2:02:24.000]  they carried out the terror attacks and I'm tired of it. I'm tired of your murder. I'm tired of
[2:02:24.000 --> 2:02:28.080]  your corruption, your grandstanding about how you're doing this all to keep me safe from terrorism.
[2:02:28.080 --> 2:02:33.120]  Look, I know what you did. Okay. And I know what the government is. It's a private group of corporate
[2:02:33.120 --> 2:02:38.240]  whores brainwashing the public to now accept global taxes paid directly into the central banks.
[2:02:38.240 --> 2:02:42.320]  I played the BBC telling you, you're going to pay your taxes into private banks.
[2:02:42.320 --> 2:02:46.880]  And I'm mad.
[2:02:51.840 --> 2:02:57.280]  U.S. big cities, big gains against Al Qaeda.
[2:02:59.280 --> 2:03:05.520]  I misspoke. U.S. sites, big gains against Al Qaeda. Rup is facing setbacks. Globally,
[2:03:05.520 --> 2:03:10.720]  C.I.A. chief says, this is always the same propaganda. They say Al Qaeda is everywhere,
[2:03:10.720 --> 2:03:15.280]  bin Laden is about to strike. There's a new wave of Al Qaeda. They're sure to have an attack with
[2:03:15.280 --> 2:03:19.760]  the new president to test our resolve to energize the new president for police state and new wars.
[2:03:20.400 --> 2:03:23.840]  You know, do me exactly what the Arabs don't want, exactly what helps the globalists. You know,
[2:03:23.840 --> 2:03:31.040]  the Al Qaeda always does that. Motive means, capability. It's a globalist. Been caught red
[2:03:31.040 --> 2:03:36.880]  handed hundreds of times at least. And now they're just running around saying, always right after
[2:03:36.880 --> 2:03:39.360]  they say they're going to kill us. They're everywhere. They're unscobbable. They say, oh,
[2:03:39.360 --> 2:03:44.880]  no, we've made a big gains. So that's basic behavioral psychology. They come in and say,
[2:03:44.880 --> 2:03:48.400]  oh my God, you're in great danger. Everything's horrible. Monsters are going to get you. It's
[2:03:48.400 --> 2:03:52.160]  like meanly walking into your child and saying, there's monsters. They're going to eat your guts
[2:03:52.160 --> 2:03:57.200]  and they're hiding under the bed, but by hugging me and being good and mommy, daddy's here,
[2:03:57.200 --> 2:04:02.560]  hug me. Oh, they don't exist now. I'll keep you safe. The monsters are everywhere. They're going
[2:04:02.560 --> 2:04:06.080]  to get you. Everything's horrible, but I'll keep you safe from them. Oh, it's okay. It's not that
[2:04:06.080 --> 2:04:11.680]  bad. There are monsters, but I ran them away in your baby. First, there's a big monster going to
[2:04:11.680 --> 2:04:15.600]  get you. He's getting stronger. He's coming at you. He's horrible. Elkite is everywhere. Oh my
[2:04:15.600 --> 2:04:20.400]  gosh. He's reconfigured. He's about to nuke us. It's all over. Oh my gosh. And then don't worry.
[2:04:20.400 --> 2:04:25.120]  I ran him off though. For now, it's not as bad as it was. Come here. Come here under those black
[2:04:25.120 --> 2:04:31.680]  wings. Yes. Oh, don't mind that knife. I'm sliding into your heart. Ah, there you go.
[2:04:31.680 --> 2:04:37.440]  Oh, that's right. Never mind those gas prices. Never mind your name being destroyed as an American.
[2:04:37.440 --> 2:04:46.640]  We use your name for ourselves. Oh, yes. You're bleeding to death now. It won't be long.

[2:07:45.680 --> 2:08:01.600]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:08:24.400 --> 2:08:30.080]  All right, let's go ahead now for about a five minute update and talk to the guy that originally
[2:08:30.080 --> 2:08:37.120]  started the Ron Paul Moneybomb. He's Eric Nordstrom. He's got the website infowarsmoneybomb.com.
[2:08:37.120 --> 2:08:44.160]  There's links to that where you can actually give on PayPal or where you can give the credit card or
[2:08:44.160 --> 2:08:47.840]  there's a toll free number going up there in the next hour or so. It may already be up there. I
[2:08:47.840 --> 2:08:52.640]  haven't looked in about an hour. And we can call starting tonight at midnight, going into Saturday
[2:08:52.640 --> 2:08:59.040]  morning, Saturday afternoon, Saturday evening until midnight, Saturday going into Sunday morning.
[2:09:00.720 --> 2:09:05.440]  And we really appreciate everybody and it's going to be exciting and we're going to use it for
[2:09:05.440 --> 2:09:11.280]  equipment, cameras, a better office. Frankly, things are so expensive. I mean, we're not a huge
[2:09:11.280 --> 2:09:16.640]  operation, but we're already spending more than 100,000 a month. In fact, well over that. Yeah,
[2:09:16.640 --> 2:09:20.640]  that's how much money's coming in. It's going right back into the operation. That's why other
[2:09:20.640 --> 2:09:24.080]  people can't get stuff off the ground and can't do it because money comes in, they got to hold on to
[2:09:24.080 --> 2:09:30.960]  it because they worship the birdcage liner. I don't. And I need your help, ladies and gentlemen,
[2:09:30.960 --> 2:09:36.640]  going to the next level and expanding. And also it reaffirms the idea of the Moneybomb.
[2:09:36.640 --> 2:09:40.240]  Eric, your take on what's going on had a lot of more pledges. People are getting excited
[2:09:40.240 --> 2:09:44.560]  and we're right up there at $80,000 now pledge and I think it's going to be even a lot bigger
[2:09:44.560 --> 2:09:49.120]  than that. I certainly hope it is Eric. Yeah, over the last few days, I've got a good feeling.
[2:09:49.120 --> 2:09:54.320]  You know, you go into these things and as long as you feel like, you know, one dollar is more
[2:09:54.320 --> 2:09:59.360]  than zero, you're in there. But yeah, I mean, we'd love to have the money. We'd love to, you know,
[2:09:59.360 --> 2:10:04.560]  I'd like to see your show on a cable dish network and the whole idea is you got to get inspired.
[2:10:04.560 --> 2:10:09.600]  You got to, you know, put a product out and I'd like to see this. This is an investment. I consider
[2:10:09.600 --> 2:10:15.440]  this an investment. The money that I put in, the time that I put in, this is an investment in the
[2:10:15.440 --> 2:10:20.560]  future because we are, you know, we are fighting the information war. I put a couple of videos
[2:10:20.560 --> 2:10:26.160]  on the website. I put one up there specifically. It's actually the, I think it was like the fourth
[2:10:26.160 --> 2:10:31.280]  video on the way down and that's the kind of thing with a rubber running into. You got a lot
[2:10:31.280 --> 2:10:38.640]  of people out there that just think that, you know, any information other than what the normal,
[2:10:38.640 --> 2:10:43.200]  you know, run-in-the-mill Fox story is, is just total kooky.
[2:10:43.200 --> 2:10:49.200]  Well, you know, here's the deal, Eric. I just ignore the naysayers and I move forward because
[2:10:50.000 --> 2:10:53.760]  they're not going to wake up. They're invested in the lie and this is done psychologically.
[2:10:53.760 --> 2:10:59.360]  The Globalist Right Policy reports on this. When they came out and said, torture children sexually
[2:10:59.360 --> 2:11:04.400]  in front of their parents in White House memos ordering the military to do that, that was the
[2:11:04.400 --> 2:11:08.800]  lowest pit of hell you can get sexually torturing children, I guess, other than killing them,
[2:11:08.800 --> 2:11:14.640]  which they also do in some cases. And so once people defended the torture, they had made a deal
[2:11:14.640 --> 2:11:19.680]  with Satan, a deal with the devil, a deal with Jeffrey Dahmer, a deal with Ted Bundy, with John
[2:11:19.680 --> 2:11:25.600]  Wayne Gacy, a deal with hell. And then they have to defend no matter what happens. And they call
[2:11:25.600 --> 2:11:32.880]  that the, the, the submit of blood and they know exactly what they're doing. They understand
[2:11:32.880 --> 2:11:40.480]  what they are doing. And so once they get you to commit, I mean, look, I get emails every day
[2:11:40.480 --> 2:11:44.720]  saying oil prices aren't up and there's no inflation and I'm a dirty liar and that there's
[2:11:44.720 --> 2:11:49.120]  no new world order as they announce it all over television. So, you know, there's going to be
[2:11:49.120 --> 2:11:54.640]  a group of people who have wed themselves to evil. They think they're good guys and they are never,
[2:11:54.640 --> 2:11:58.080]  I mean, that's why Nazis would do more and more evil. That's why the Soviets would do more and
[2:11:58.080 --> 2:12:04.000]  more evil because they, they, once they have done, once somebody's attacked me and said I'm a liar
[2:12:04.000 --> 2:12:08.400]  or I'm this or I'm that, they can never go back. Most of them don't have the moral courage to admit
[2:12:08.400 --> 2:12:12.560]  they were wrong. So they're always going to attack me and just add more lies onto what they claim
[2:12:12.560 --> 2:12:17.600]  about me or Ron Paul or somebody else because they can't ever admit they were wrong. Me,
[2:12:17.600 --> 2:12:22.000]  I will admit I'm wrong. Me, I will admit when I've done something and I'm not saying I'm some great
[2:12:22.000 --> 2:12:29.200]  person, but you know, I want to have integrity. But Eric, again, other issues about the money bomb?
[2:12:30.960 --> 2:12:36.400]  Well, certainly is a matter of perspective. I'm always having to correct people in this,
[2:12:36.400 --> 2:12:40.960]  in as far as the value of the dollar is actually going down, whereas they think the gas prices
[2:12:40.960 --> 2:12:47.200]  and whatnot are going up. And so again, it's a matter of perspective. And that goes along
[2:12:47.200 --> 2:12:52.000]  with the same with the money bomb. You know, you can't sit there and think the money bomb is an
[2:12:52.000 --> 2:12:57.520]  exclusively political thing. Or even if you do think it's a political thing for candidates,
[2:12:58.240 --> 2:13:03.120]  I can't think of a better way for helping all candidates, you know, no matter what party
[2:13:03.840 --> 2:13:10.400]  of the constitutional nature, you know, to be able to be on Dishnet or to be able to be hosted
[2:13:10.400 --> 2:13:17.120]  by Alex Jones and on videos. I think a lot of the reason that, say, Ron Paul got his
[2:13:17.120 --> 2:13:23.120]  popularity was because of the videos that he was on, from freedom of fascism, etc. I mean,
[2:13:23.120 --> 2:13:28.880]  you know, people saw him on those movies and that's where a lot of the fascination came for Ron Paul.
[2:13:28.880 --> 2:13:32.880]  Well, Eric, let me break it down for people to be specific. I was already planning and I got the
[2:13:32.880 --> 2:13:36.720]  lease. I got to finish up with a lawyer and sign it to move into bigger office because we're stacked
[2:13:36.720 --> 2:13:43.040]  up on top of each other. And I am going to do at least once a week Dishnetwork show. That's all
[2:13:43.040 --> 2:13:48.560]  I have the money for. Maybe if I was able to get sponsors move it to once a day or five days a week.
[2:13:49.760 --> 2:13:57.680]  But if we had a million dollars come in, we would, for about a year, be able to build a basic
[2:13:57.680 --> 2:14:04.240]  studio, have my show once a day, rear on the weekend, and then catapult that into some type of
[2:14:04.240 --> 2:14:09.280]  network from that. That's how that's how democracy now started. And then, you know, they have
[2:14:09.280 --> 2:14:13.200]  Willie Nelson, everybody else once a year goes and has a fundraiser. They raise a four or five
[2:14:13.200 --> 2:14:18.160]  million dollars and that funds it for a year and they've got dozens of shows now and tens of millions
[2:14:18.160 --> 2:14:23.680]  a day tune in. And then it gets magnified on the internet. The problem is they're putting out somewhat
[2:14:23.680 --> 2:14:28.240]  of an anti-establishment, but with a leftward angle, it's certainly better than Fox and CNN.
[2:14:29.440 --> 2:14:32.800]  But it's still anti-gun a few things I don't like. I know Willie doesn't like, but he still
[2:14:32.800 --> 2:14:38.160]  overall supports it. And so we, I mean, I will do this. This is a lot of work I'm stepping into.
[2:14:38.160 --> 2:14:44.480]  This is a big commitment. But yeah, if a hundred thousand comes in, that'll just let me get a once
[2:14:44.480 --> 2:14:48.640]  a week, twice a week, three times a week show up quicker. That'll let us have better computers,
[2:14:48.640 --> 2:14:53.120]  a few more staff. I mean, it's a hundred grand. That hires two or three people at decent living
[2:14:53.120 --> 2:14:58.320]  and then maybe a few computers. I mean, it takes a lot of money to do this, folks. And that's one
[2:14:58.320 --> 2:15:02.880]  reason I've been effective. I'll say it again, because money comes in here and it goes right back
[2:15:02.880 --> 2:15:07.280]  into equipment and personnel. And we just don't bring in enough to go to the next level. And so
[2:15:07.280 --> 2:15:12.960]  instead of crawling, we can run, if people will go viral with this and donate a million dollars.
[2:15:13.680 --> 2:15:17.520]  Now a million dollars is what a hundred thousand dollars was 15, 20 years ago.
[2:15:18.240 --> 2:15:21.680]  So understand we're really asking for a hundred thousand in federal reserve notes.
[2:15:21.680 --> 2:15:26.400]  And in a year, it'll probably be, you know, a hundred thousand will be, you know, the equivalent
[2:15:26.400 --> 2:15:31.200]  of, you know, 20,000. I mean, it's just evaporating. So you're also taking something.
[2:15:31.760 --> 2:15:34.880]  And I mean, that's another reason I want to go ahead and expand so I can spend a little bit of
[2:15:34.880 --> 2:15:39.440]  the money we've built up because I don't want to just, no, it's not a lot, but I have some sitting
[2:15:39.440 --> 2:15:44.880]  in a couple bank accounts. So again, I've explained this to listeners. I'm going to expend my fuel.
[2:15:44.880 --> 2:15:50.960]  We need added fuel because Eric, I know you work in the Air Force. I mean, you need fuel
[2:15:50.960 --> 2:15:55.520]  to get a bomber somewhere to drop bombs on the enemy. And that's what this is, is an info war.
[2:15:55.520 --> 2:15:59.840]  Yes, you do. You know, and you've got a lot of good allies out there, you know, between G.
[2:15:59.840 --> 2:16:06.880]  Edgar Griffin at the Freedom Force International, you know, on others, you've got so much content
[2:16:06.880 --> 2:16:11.200]  that we could be putting on television 24 seven. And I always look at it as, you know,
[2:16:11.200 --> 2:16:15.360]  you've got to shoot for the stars. You've got to go for the highest level. If you hit the moon,
[2:16:15.360 --> 2:16:20.800]  that's fantastic. But we got to go off the ground in any case. And so I'm hoping that, you know,
[2:16:20.800 --> 2:16:27.200]  let's do this. Let's do this. Well, there's no doubt that a better produced TV program,
[2:16:27.200 --> 2:16:32.720]  and I'm pretty good on TV. And then Gaston and other things and I'd even hook it up where you
[2:16:32.720 --> 2:16:37.840]  can pretty inexpensively, comparatively, have other people that even tape their shows once a week
[2:16:37.840 --> 2:16:42.160]  and then send them in to us. Or we had the money, the fiber optic connection, where they'd upload
[2:16:42.160 --> 2:16:47.600]  it to us. And there's a lot of new technologies that I mean, just five years ago, it would take
[2:16:47.600 --> 2:16:53.440]  $10 million to start a network. Now it only cost a few million to do it. And again, ladies and
[2:16:53.440 --> 2:16:58.000]  gentlemen, I do everything I say I'm going to do. So it's literally in your hands. It is up to you
[2:16:58.000 --> 2:17:01.760]  what happens with this money bomb. If this money bomb successful, maybe we'll have a money bomb
[2:17:01.760 --> 2:17:06.400]  once a year or something, or a fundraising week. I don't like doing this. I'd rather you support
[2:17:06.400 --> 2:17:11.600]  our AM and FM affiliates. I'd rather have sponsors and things, but it just doesn't bring in the
[2:17:11.600 --> 2:17:18.080]  capital we need to be able to promptly do this. And I need more fuel. I mean, if I want to take
[2:17:18.080 --> 2:17:23.920]  off in my beef, beefy to my info wars, beefy to fly over the new older capital in the info war
[2:17:23.920 --> 2:17:28.640]  and blow the daylights out of them. I need the fuel. I've got the bombs, but I just need to get
[2:17:28.640 --> 2:17:33.360]  over the enemy and drop weapons on them. And we're going to do that. And so it's up to you.
[2:17:33.360 --> 2:17:36.960]  You've got the ball, ladies and gentlemen, we need the info wars money bomb. It starts in about 10
[2:17:36.960 --> 2:17:42.560]  hours at info wars.com to launch. We're going to have people here at midnight to take your phone
[2:17:42.560 --> 2:17:47.440]  calls. We're going to order that way. And by order, we're going to do a thing where if you even want
[2:17:47.440 --> 2:17:51.120]  to do it over the shopping cart, you can get a free citizen rulebook for gifts or things like that,
[2:17:51.120 --> 2:17:56.960]  or if you want to call in and donate whatever tonight, midnight, central standard time. And I
[2:17:56.960 --> 2:18:00.800]  just want to thank you for having the idea to do this. And I know you'll be on the show with me
[2:18:00.800 --> 2:18:05.760]  tomorrow from eight to midnight popping in as we track all of this. You will also have a graph
[2:18:05.760 --> 2:18:09.760]  we're going to be giving you in the next few hours. So we can update the numbers as they come in
[2:18:09.760 --> 2:18:14.080]  that graph will also be an info wars, but also info wars money bomb.com. People can see their
[2:18:14.080 --> 2:18:19.280]  donations as they build up. And I really appreciate you coming on the show, Eric Nordstrom.
[2:18:19.280 --> 2:18:24.960]  That's fantastic, sir. Just, you know, I say a pledge now with a few dollars, pay now with
[2:18:24.960 --> 2:18:28.480]  a few dollars or pay later with your liberty. Absolutely. Let me talk to you in the break.
[2:18:28.480 --> 2:18:31.840]  We're going to break in about a minute. I want to tell you something. Okay, I'm going to come back,
[2:18:31.840 --> 2:18:38.640]  cover some news. And man, there is so much of it in flights or valence could foil terrorism
[2:18:38.640 --> 2:18:45.280]  in the sky. New scientists, companies to put in camera in seat cameras to watch your faces.
[2:18:45.280 --> 2:18:49.600]  The artificial intelligence computer system will decide if you're planning a terror attack
[2:18:49.600 --> 2:18:54.320]  off your facial expression. See now an excuse to swat you now an excuse to taser with the
[2:18:54.320 --> 2:18:59.440]  air marshal now an excuse to put you on a list because you had gas and made a frown.
[2:19:00.320 --> 2:19:04.320]  You see, and then it's all quackery eight million of you was a million. Now he learns
[2:19:04.320 --> 2:19:09.600]  eight million on the terror list. He'll all be terrorists where they're done. Eight million
[2:19:09.600 --> 2:19:15.680]  al-Qaeda is an America total bull. There's not one real al-Qaeda CIA shame on these murderers.
[2:19:16.480 --> 2:19:21.120]  Send it to push carbon tax enslavement bill. We'll cover this when we get back. Try US Senate
[2:19:21.120 --> 2:19:27.680]  moving to give you your enslavement and they will phase it in within the next few years
[2:19:27.680 --> 2:19:34.400]  on all of your energy costs gasoline power light bulbs. But then they're going to bring it in with
[2:19:34.400 --> 2:19:40.240]  a card and you'll swipe that it will hold your credits. And then when you're out of credits
[2:19:40.240 --> 2:19:44.240]  and it's designed where you have about half the credits you need to live, you will pay the Federal
[2:19:44.240 --> 2:19:51.040]  Reserve taxes. Our beloved Republic is on her knees. The forces of globalism are destroying
[2:19:51.040 --> 2:19:55.920]  national sovereignty worldwide. But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope. The first time in
[2:19:55.920 --> 2:20:00.480]  modern history, the people are beginning to wake up. It is essential that patriots worldwide
[2:20:00.480 --> 2:20:04.720]  accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the new world order master plan. We have a short
[2:20:04.720 --> 2:20:09.360]  time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat. In the info war,

[2:20:47.040 --> 2:20:53.760]  Hi, Ted Anders from Midas, May 29, 2008. Gold, 8.91. Honseco coins can be purchased for 9.17.90.
[2:20:53.760 --> 2:21:00.640]  4.52.15 for half, 2.2.6.08 for quarter. That's 9.17.94.52.15 and 2.2.6.08.
[2:21:01.360 --> 2:21:05.760]  For years, Ron Paul has taken the position to uphold constitutional rights. He's been branded
[2:21:05.760 --> 2:21:10.880]  by special interest groups as Dr. Noel, refusing to bend his values. I can only imagine the pressure
[2:21:10.880 --> 2:21:15.600]  applied by Congress as he stands alone for these principles. He has given up a medical career for
[2:21:15.600 --> 2:21:21.280]  this. Ron Paul is running for president. The ideas of strong currency ending the war, defending
[2:21:21.280 --> 2:21:26.640]  the Constitution, and protecting civil liberties are catching on. As a thank you, GCNlive.com,
[2:21:26.640 --> 2:21:31.600]  Midas Resources and I would like to send you a free copy of the Ron Paul Family Cookbook.

[2:22:47.120 --> 2:22:51.680]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism,
[2:22:51.680 --> 2:22:55.920]  but globalism. Globalists are concerned with what's good for the American empire instead
[2:22:55.920 --> 2:23:00.160]  of what's fair for the American people. The only antidote to the poison of globalism is
[2:23:00.160 --> 2:23:04.480]  nationalism, which is why you should be reading The Nationalist Times each month. We promote a

[2:24:24.560 --> 2:24:28.880]  Why do you think we're a leader in power? They're smart. They're cunning. They're slick.
[2:24:28.880 --> 2:24:38.560]  They're con artists. They know how to manipulate you. They convinced you that you were the big boss,
[2:24:38.560 --> 2:24:42.320]  that you weren't being manipulated, that you weren't being conned, that there wasn't an elite,
[2:24:42.320 --> 2:24:47.200]  that corrupt elites don't exist. That was like existing you, but there aren't. That was like
[2:24:47.200 --> 2:24:53.040]  convincing you there weren't fish in the sea or a sun in the sky or birds in the trees or grass on
[2:24:53.040 --> 2:25:00.640]  the ground. I mean, they convinced you to just trust and mindlessly tune out of reality. Like
[2:25:00.640 --> 2:25:05.760]  the world's just some wonderland where you just run around happily giggling and snickering to yourself
[2:25:05.760 --> 2:25:17.200]  like a mindless weed head. Meanwhile, evil grew. Meanwhile, evil grew. And I'm just a good old boy
[2:25:17.200 --> 2:25:22.080]  that isn't stupid. And I can read their own documents and it freaks me out. And I am sitting
[2:25:22.080 --> 2:25:27.520]  here screaming and yelling that we're under attack or under bombardment, trying everything I can to
[2:25:27.520 --> 2:25:32.880]  get you to see the big picture and realize what we're doing as a society, where we're going
[2:25:34.240 --> 2:25:38.800]  and trying to get you to be an active participant in your own life, trying to get you to engage with
[2:25:38.800 --> 2:25:42.480]  reality. I mean, look at this. Lee Rogers did a great report on this upon infowork.com from
[2:25:42.480 --> 2:25:46.560]  rogue government, sent it to push carbon tax enslavement bill. The establishment is getting
[2:25:46.560 --> 2:25:52.640]  ready to push for with Joe Lieberman's proposed carbon credit enslavement bill. The bill, otherwise
[2:25:52.640 --> 2:25:58.480]  known as American Climate Security Act, oh, it's all for security, just like Homeland Security
[2:25:58.480 --> 2:26:05.040]  and Patriot Act of 2007 or S 2191 has been reintroduced will give the Environmental Protection
[2:26:05.040 --> 2:26:10.000]  Agency draconian powers implement a carbon credit system here in the United States, a new tax system
[2:26:10.000 --> 2:26:15.920]  over everything. Read the full analysis of the bill here. This is nothing more than a carbon
[2:26:15.920 --> 2:26:21.600]  tax. And the bill intends to reduce the amount of available carbon credits on a year to year
[2:26:21.600 --> 2:26:29.760]  basis starting in the year 2012. Now, again, that means phasing and end everything. This will
[2:26:29.760 --> 2:26:34.240]  effectively make it more difficult for small and medium sized businesses to compete with the large
[2:26:34.240 --> 2:26:39.120]  multinational corporations who have had the resources to deal with the ridiculous environmental
[2:26:39.120 --> 2:26:44.400]  enslavement tax. The threat of manmade carbon emissions causing global warming is a documented
[2:26:44.400 --> 2:26:50.560]  fraud over 31,000 scientists have recently come forward, refuting the claims of Al Gore and others
[2:26:50.560 --> 2:26:55.760]  who are promoting this lie. The fact that the corporate controlled media can continue to provide
[2:26:55.760 --> 2:27:02.000]  and promote this huge lie is a propaganda to pass the carbon credit initiative is utterly insane.
[2:27:02.640 --> 2:27:06.880]  According to the Seattle Post intelligence, her debate is going to begin on this legislation
[2:27:06.880 --> 2:27:11.600]  next week or the beginning of June. For years, the Senate Committee on Environmental and Public
[2:27:11.600 --> 2:27:17.360]  Works was a burial ground for legislation addressing, among other things, cold power
[2:27:17.360 --> 2:27:21.360]  electricity generation. The US has about a quarter of the world's known supply of coal,
[2:27:21.360 --> 2:27:25.200]  and coal is a primary source of electricity in this country. Hydroelectric power is not
[2:27:25.200 --> 2:27:30.240]  as problematic elsewhere in the region. They call the US a region in the Senate. This is
[2:27:31.120 --> 2:27:35.200]  commonly said that reducing the emissions of coal using generate electricity is vital
[2:27:35.200 --> 2:27:40.400]  to controlling greenhouse gas emissions here. Most seem to believe that this is a cornerstone to
[2:27:40.400 --> 2:27:44.720]  any effective policy. In December, the committee with the Democratic majority passed America's
[2:27:44.720 --> 2:27:51.200]  Climate Security Act of 2007. The bill will be debated in the Senate next week. The Republicans
[2:27:51.200 --> 2:27:55.360]  are split on this bill. Larry Craig and other Republicans did all they could to prevent the
[2:27:55.360 --> 2:27:59.360]  bill from getting out of conference. The bill, though, is sponsored by Joe Lieberman and John
[2:27:59.360 --> 2:28:06.400]  Warner. Warner is on the committee and they act like Republicans. Oh, I accidentally burned down
[2:28:06.400 --> 2:28:15.840]  the restaurant when we were in debt. I accidentally lightning struck. Oh, they're so conservative.
[2:28:15.840 --> 2:28:19.120]  Even though this is absolutely no difference between the Republicans and the Democrats,
[2:28:19.120 --> 2:28:22.480]  it's pretty close. The establishment has held in on pushing the thing through. The majority of
[2:28:22.480 --> 2:28:26.320]  Democrats are going to support the bill. And if they don't pass it this year, they've got
[2:28:26.320 --> 2:28:30.160]  Valhalla coming. Barack Obama or Hillary, it looks like they're going to win. It could be
[2:28:30.160 --> 2:28:35.440]  McCain. Who knows? And then they'll control the House and the Senate, and it's all going to
[2:28:35.440 --> 2:28:41.840]  continue. The wars, taxes, gun control, amnesty. Because you look at the establishment, they're
[2:28:41.840 --> 2:28:51.920]  all together. You look at these people and they agree on every single issue right down the line.
[2:28:55.600 --> 2:29:02.080]  Open borders, gun control, carbon taxes, the Iraq war, the parties are all for it.
[2:29:02.080 --> 2:29:08.240]  The parties are all for it because the parties are bought and paid for by the same people.
[2:29:08.240 --> 2:29:11.760]  And let me give all the establishment folks out there. I think they're members of the
[2:29:11.760 --> 2:29:18.400]  establishment newsflash. Seven trillion has been spent or disappeared out of the Pentagon
[2:29:18.400 --> 2:29:27.200]  in the last six and a half years. Seven trillion. You understand the biggest robbery in history.
[2:29:27.200 --> 2:29:32.480]  That's why you've been militarized and told we're the enemy. Because you're now to bring us to the
[2:29:32.480 --> 2:29:58.480]  next level. We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.

[2:32:20.400 --> 2:32:25.520]  and are now rushing in to buy our food production at any price. By late summer, if not early fall,
[2:32:25.520 --> 2:32:30.240]  it is likely our government will step in and control food and food exports under martial law.

[2:33:24.560 --> 2:33:27.600]  About 15 years ago when I really woke up to the New World Order,
[2:33:28.720 --> 2:33:33.200]  I mean I'd read Nundair Call of Conspiracy 17 years ago.
[2:33:35.600 --> 2:33:38.960]  I began reading U.N. documents. I began reading their own books.
[2:33:38.960 --> 2:33:45.360]  I got a copy of Tragedy and Hope and they said they were going to restrict our food,
[2:33:45.360 --> 2:33:52.000]  our water, they were going to train us because they said a middle class created liberty and
[2:33:52.000 --> 2:33:55.760]  freedom and now they're training you to accept $4 a gallon gas. They're training you to accept
[2:33:55.760 --> 2:34:03.600]  that water isn't inexpensive artificially, creating artificial scarcity. They are training you how to
[2:34:03.600 --> 2:34:10.000]  be a slave. They want 99% of us being absolutely slaves living in shacks with roving bands of
[2:34:10.000 --> 2:34:13.760]  heavily armed paramilitary police ruling over us and that is the New World Order. That's what
[2:34:13.760 --> 2:34:18.240]  they say it is. I've heard NPR many times. We've got a guest coming on who's going to push it
[2:34:18.240 --> 2:34:22.560]  so you can hear it from the horse's mouth about how we consume too much and how we're bad and
[2:34:22.560 --> 2:34:27.920]  how we've got to pay. For lack of a better term, this is communism. I mean for us it will be living
[2:34:27.920 --> 2:34:33.600]  like communist slaves. For the elite they get all the, I mean here in Austin they took tens of
[2:34:33.600 --> 2:34:38.080]  thousands of acres and two different big land buys claiming they were going to turn into huge
[2:34:38.080 --> 2:34:43.840]  city parks that no houses could be built on it. They would for a decade told farmers ranchers
[2:34:43.840 --> 2:34:47.600]  that they couldn't sell the property, they increased their taxes on it, that they couldn't
[2:34:47.600 --> 2:34:52.080]  build on it for the earth, for the Edwardsographer, for the salamander claiming runoff is hurting the
[2:34:52.080 --> 2:34:59.600]  salamander. As soon as they got it, five star hotels, golf courses, luxury spas, million dollar,
[2:34:59.600 --> 2:35:07.760]  five million dollar, they started a million ranchettes and the elite are all moving in there.
[2:35:09.600 --> 2:35:15.520]  I mean I live here. I mean I've been in radio debates on other radio shows with the local SOS
[2:35:15.520 --> 2:35:19.280]  people and local environmental heads and they'll just laugh and the parking lot they'll go Joe,
[2:35:19.280 --> 2:35:23.040]  you're not going to stop us and I've been to smart growth conferences where they'll just
[2:35:23.040 --> 2:35:27.760]  laugh even on stage and go yeah it's about money, we're taking over and they just started laughing
[2:35:27.760 --> 2:35:32.080]  and these are vicious criminals folks. You just need to go to a smart growth conference and see
[2:35:32.080 --> 2:35:39.440]  like they had here several thousand city managers and bank heads of major banks and the owner of
[2:35:39.440 --> 2:35:43.360]  Dell computers, Michael Dell, I interviewed him, I got to find that tape, we put it on access,
[2:35:43.360 --> 2:35:47.360]  people have seen it, the newspaper wrote it up, it's in the Austin Chronicle, they're right up on
[2:35:47.360 --> 2:35:52.960]  it, I can't even find my own tape and I laid it out, I mean it is business because you see
[2:35:52.960 --> 2:35:57.120]  the people with connections get to build a factory or get to build a hotel, it means you
[2:35:57.120 --> 2:36:03.840]  don't, do you understand? Now tying into all this and I'm going to tell you right now I hope he's
[2:36:03.840 --> 2:36:08.560]  wrong and I don't know what's going to happen but he told us a year ago on air that food prices
[2:36:08.560 --> 2:36:13.440]  were going to go up and they have gone up globally about 50%, about 25 to 30% depending on what it
[2:36:13.440 --> 2:36:18.560]  is, some of them have doubled, they are having rationing you know of how much corn or how much
[2:36:18.560 --> 2:36:24.320]  rice you can buy places but farmers are putting in at least around here in Texas, we're seeing
[2:36:24.320 --> 2:36:28.720]  farming come back so that's one thing that's happened, Steve will tell you that and I did
[2:36:28.720 --> 2:36:34.400]  look up the numbers he said a month ago when he was on with us, he said that they were raising
[2:36:34.400 --> 2:36:38.800]  less corn this year than last and I went and looked it up and he was right, I mean I actually was,
[2:36:38.800 --> 2:36:44.400]  I believe Steve believes what he's saying but I was really getting shocked by it so I did some
[2:36:44.400 --> 2:36:48.800]  research that night, I listened to the rebroadcast and wrote down a bunch of things he said and
[2:36:48.800 --> 2:36:53.840]  went and looked it up and it was happening, now a lot of this is speculation because the dollars
[2:36:53.840 --> 2:36:58.400]  are being devalued so people are dumping their dollars globally into that but a lot of it is
[2:36:58.400 --> 2:37:06.320]  bad weather, tsunamis, hurricanes, typhoons, too much rain, too little rain and then of course the
[2:37:06.320 --> 2:37:12.160]  dollar being devalued and then ethanol and the rest of it, so all, the prices have gone up,
[2:37:12.160 --> 2:37:16.080]  there is talk of depression, it's smart to have storable food and that's why I'm pushing this,
[2:37:16.080 --> 2:37:21.760]  I believe in it, I've done it, Steve thinks it's curtains and he's in food supply, it's a big company
[2:37:21.760 --> 2:37:27.120]  and so he's here to give us a report on what he's seeing as a big food supplier, somebody who gets
[2:37:27.120 --> 2:37:32.160]  it from the bigger suppliers, Steve Shanker, thank you for coming on with us at fooddirect.com.
[2:37:32.160 --> 2:37:39.760]  Well, it's great to be again with you, it's just absolutely amazing what goes on, Alex.
[2:37:41.360 --> 2:37:49.600]  This last week we got an interesting report, the financial organizations are reporting the fact
[2:37:50.880 --> 2:37:57.840]  that we now are dealing at least to a certain extent with our international trade deficit,
[2:37:57.840 --> 2:38:05.920]  notwithstanding the fact that the dollar is crashing, we are now selling enough stuff so that
[2:38:05.920 --> 2:38:11.840]  the balance of trade, the trade deficit the United States has is being reduced,
[2:38:12.720 --> 2:38:18.000]  but guess what they're selling to reduce it? They're selling our food and they're selling
[2:38:18.000 --> 2:38:23.680]  our production which gets counted as a trade deal when the farms move from the valley in Texas
[2:38:23.680 --> 2:38:30.800]  or Southern California to Mexico. That's right. So we're even moving production, it's all over
[2:38:30.800 --> 2:38:39.360]  yeah. Absolutely, and the thing is is that we announced the last time that you and I talked,
[2:38:39.360 --> 2:38:44.720]  the fact that we have rationing of rice and wheat flour in this country.
[2:38:44.720 --> 2:38:56.000]  We counseled people to put in at least two gallons of cooking oil for each adult one-year
[2:38:56.000 --> 2:39:03.120]  supply of food that they were storing back. Now, here's what has happened just recently.
[2:39:04.000 --> 2:39:10.320]  At the same time, we have people virtually standing in bread lines. Now, McDonald's announced the
[2:39:10.320 --> 2:39:18.400]  fact that they're not going to increase the cost of their $1 menu because it would affect
[2:39:18.400 --> 2:39:24.080]  the way investors look at their stock. So they're subsidizing. Those of you that are not buying the
[2:39:24.080 --> 2:39:31.760]  $1 menu are subsidizing. Let me stop you. Mexico is also announcing they're trying to freeze prices
[2:39:31.760 --> 2:39:37.280]  and then I also saw Walmart is going to freeze, but then they're going to have to ration and so
[2:39:37.280 --> 2:39:42.400]  you're right because that would then affect their stock. Go ahead. Sorry. So what happens
[2:39:43.440 --> 2:39:48.240]  what happens is virtually Americans are standing in bread lines. The people that are going to
[2:39:48.240 --> 2:39:53.760]  McDonald's and buying their $1 menu because that's all they can afford, they are being
[2:39:53.760 --> 2:39:59.200]  subsidized by the rest of you that are buying the regular menu at McDonald's and that's nothing
[2:39:59.200 --> 2:40:06.160]  more than a bread line. Only you're subsidizing it. The fact is that we have Americans going to
[2:40:06.160 --> 2:40:11.120]  their grocery stores and being told that they can't get as much wheat flour as they want and in
[2:40:11.120 --> 2:40:18.800]  some areas they're not getting it at all. We're having Americans go to buy rice and be told in
[2:40:18.800 --> 2:40:25.840]  even small stores that they can only have one bag and sometimes none at all. So we virtually
[2:40:25.840 --> 2:40:32.880]  have bread lines forming here in the United States and the thieves now have discovered
[2:40:32.880 --> 2:40:45.840]  that $5 or $4 a gallon fuel is more expensive than the cooking oil that they can steal from the
[2:40:47.200 --> 2:40:55.280]  fast food restaurants and turn into fuel. So we have a double hit, Alex. The double hit is very
[2:40:55.280 --> 2:41:02.240]  simple. Fuel prices are going up astronomically. Food prices are going up astronomically and
[2:41:02.240 --> 2:41:07.360]  anytime you have that happen you will have the criminal element involved and literally criminals
[2:41:07.360 --> 2:41:15.280]  are stealing the cooking oil from fast food restaurants in order to turn it into diesel fuel.
[2:41:16.000 --> 2:41:22.000]  Now what this all means to you and me and Joe Lunchbucket out there is very simple. We are
[2:41:22.000 --> 2:41:29.680]  standing in bread lines. Our fuel is going past our ability to even get to our jobs and they
[2:41:29.680 --> 2:41:38.880]  are selling our food to resolve the national trade deficit and bragging about it. Commodities
[2:41:38.880 --> 2:41:44.000]  investors are bragging about it. But let's explain. The dollar's tanking. So we are like a third
[2:41:44.000 --> 2:41:49.680]  world country so we're being looted. Everybody's coming and not just buying ports and roads in
[2:41:49.680 --> 2:41:54.640]  the police department and the water district and everything being handed over and cops out doubling,
[2:41:54.640 --> 2:42:02.480]  troubling the tickets, they're riding, squeezing the poor pathetic slaves. Now on top of all of
[2:42:02.480 --> 2:42:09.840]  that they're buying up the food. That's right. Now what this means very simply. About two weeks
[2:42:09.840 --> 2:42:16.720]  ago we announced on your program that we were forced into a price increase and the reason for
[2:42:16.720 --> 2:42:23.040]  that you'll find that some of the retailers, many folks are finding that they're retailers selling
[2:42:23.040 --> 2:42:28.880]  this these long-term storeable foods. Many of them didn't have to go with price increases because
[2:42:28.880 --> 2:42:35.760]  they're still selling junk left over from 1999. One of the things that we're doing, people are
[2:42:35.760 --> 2:42:43.280]  trusting eFoods Direct as a result of your counsel with them and they're buying food and we guarantee
[2:42:43.280 --> 2:42:49.520]  that nothing is stored from any longer than when we get the order. So we're buying in fresh stuff
[2:42:49.520 --> 2:42:54.880]  but the disadvantage is that the pricing is pricing we got to pay. So what we did is exactly the
[2:42:54.880 --> 2:43:01.840]  same thing we've been telling people to do. We went out and bought truckloads of wheat back
[2:43:01.840 --> 2:43:09.440]  before it started being rationed when we were seeing the wheat problems coming up and as a result
[2:43:09.440 --> 2:43:15.360]  of that we just got delivery on several of those truckloads. Two weeks ago we announced a price
[2:43:15.360 --> 2:43:22.960]  increase. Right now as a result of having all that wheat and being able to trade it back to the
[2:43:22.960 --> 2:43:28.960]  suppliers for other other items like fruits and vegetables that are virtually impossible to get
[2:43:28.960 --> 2:43:35.840]  right now at the supply lines. We are now announcing for the first time on your show that we are going
[2:43:35.840 --> 2:43:41.760]  to have a rollback almost to the point of where the price increase started just because we did
[2:43:41.760 --> 2:43:47.760]  exactly what we're telling your listeners to do. We're telling your listeners to go out and get food
[2:43:47.760 --> 2:43:52.240]  in while they can still afford it and then when the prices go astronomical they don't have to be
[2:43:52.240 --> 2:43:58.400]  afraid of the problems. What we have done is we've traded several truckloads of wheat for the other
[2:43:58.400 --> 2:44:06.400]  fruits and vegetables so that they're all fresh and now if you look on the website eFoodsDirect.com
[2:44:06.400 --> 2:44:12.240]  you'll find we're announcing a rollback of the price increase we had a couple months ago or a
[2:44:12.240 --> 2:44:18.880]  couple weeks ago to almost the same prices we had and we're going to be able to ship out food
[2:44:19.600 --> 2:44:25.040]  at considerably less than what these people would have to be paying just because we did exactly what
[2:44:25.040 --> 2:44:31.200]  we're telling them to do. Go out and get that dad gum food while you can afford it before it disappears
[2:44:31.200 --> 2:44:37.920]  before it's rationed before you can't buy it and call eFoodsDirect.com and do it. Okay eFoodsDirect.com
[2:44:37.920 --> 2:44:43.520]  big links at the top of info wars.com and PrismPlanet.com but Steve give out the phone number.
[2:44:44.400 --> 2:44:54.560]  It's 800-409-5633 for those of you that aren't up on the internet 800-409-5633. The main thing
[2:44:54.560 --> 2:45:03.120]  that I'm dealing with in this Alex is the fact that as a result of analyzing the news and what's
[2:45:03.120 --> 2:45:07.760]  happening out there in the future I know that it makes you nervous when we come back with this
[2:45:07.760 --> 2:45:13.520]  stuff but these aren't wild eyed predictions we've been at this for 27 years Alex and
[2:45:14.080 --> 2:45:21.200]  and you know it may look like gee whiz I've got some sort of a crystal ball. The fact is that
[2:45:21.200 --> 2:45:27.760]  history repeats itself. People behave in a certain way. If we know the objective is to control the
[2:45:27.760 --> 2:45:33.200]  population with food it doesn't take a brain surgeon to look at the fact that we have shortages in
[2:45:33.200 --> 2:45:39.920]  America. Our food is being sold off. The grain markets are screaming because foreign countries
[2:45:39.920 --> 2:45:49.360]  are coming in here with cheap American dollars. 1-800-409-5633. 1-800-409-5633. No I mean
[2:45:49.360 --> 2:45:53.280]  with the talk of depression with huge inflation that's happening I think it's a good idea to
[2:45:53.280 --> 2:45:58.240]  have swarble food at any uncertain times. I've been storing food for 10 years plus so I believe in
[2:45:58.240 --> 2:46:03.680]  it Steve. My only issue is that it's just hard to believe it's going to get as bad as even the
[2:46:03.680 --> 2:46:07.760]  mainstream media saying and I've seen them do that before and I think maybe the speculation
[2:46:07.760 --> 2:46:13.200]  could end or a big crop could come in but then I go look things up and they are growing less corn
[2:46:13.200 --> 2:46:17.680]  than they did last year which is pretty bizarre and so we know a lot of things that are corn fed
[2:46:17.680 --> 2:46:21.600]  like meats and things are going to go up so there's no doubt that it's a good idea to have
[2:46:21.600 --> 2:46:27.120]  swarble foods. I just I know they're doing this I mean I know they're doing this okay I know they
[2:46:27.120 --> 2:46:32.000]  engineered the gas going up in the 70s and the documents have now come out to train us to accept
[2:46:32.000 --> 2:46:35.920]  higher gas prices so we know they're artificially doing that now and I know they're training us
[2:46:35.920 --> 2:46:41.520]  to accept higher food prices now this is part of our raping so I know this is happening my whole
[2:46:41.520 --> 2:46:45.360]  deal is is that this is what I've seen them do they'll run gas up from a dollar to two dollars
[2:46:45.360 --> 2:46:49.520]  and it drops back down to a dollar fifty and you're happy to take a dollar fifty then they run it up
[2:46:49.520 --> 2:46:53.360]  to three dollars you're happy to take two fifty when it goes back down then they run up to three
[2:46:53.360 --> 2:46:57.520]  fifty and you're happy to have it be three dollars then they run it up to four fifty like like it's
[2:46:57.520 --> 2:47:02.320]  going now and then you're happy when it's only three fifty so my thing is is a yeah no I mean the
[2:47:02.320 --> 2:47:06.080]  way the new world's operating and the crazy government we've gotten I think people should
[2:47:06.080 --> 2:47:10.720]  get swarble foods I just I just never know what they're going to do next because it's so confusing
[2:47:10.720 --> 2:47:15.680]  but you are there in the food company so you're seeing it and you're telling me that you say
[2:47:15.680 --> 2:47:22.160]  it's going to get worse well I'll tell you exactly what's going on I've got a whole bunch of cattle
[2:47:22.160 --> 2:47:28.880]  ranchers out in in Missouri that I'm going to have a meeting with next weekend and we're discussing
[2:47:29.520 --> 2:47:36.960]  what the what the situation is the the farmers that are growing the grains the grains are being
[2:47:36.960 --> 2:47:42.960]  boosted up so high in price the corn particularly which is the mash for the cattle because of
[2:47:42.960 --> 2:47:49.920]  subsidizing of ethanol these farmers can't afford to buy the feed to feed your dairy cows to feed
[2:47:49.920 --> 2:47:56.480]  your poultry to feed all of your basic protein source for the country they are now selling out
[2:47:56.480 --> 2:48:03.360]  dairy herds because the farmers can't afford to feed them now what that's going to do and this is
[2:48:03.360 --> 2:48:09.680]  a prediction but if that's coming that's going to be a chain reaction in all milk products well
[2:48:09.680 --> 2:48:13.760]  not only that you're going to have a glut in the beef market your beef prices might go down for a
[2:48:13.760 --> 2:48:19.840]  little bit and then after that you won't have any beef at all and what will happen is that
[2:48:19.840 --> 2:48:27.360]  that we have we have the rice farmers that are being paid you see one of the big issues right
[2:48:27.360 --> 2:48:35.520]  now if you watch the commodities investors if you as as consumers if our listeners would just
[2:48:35.520 --> 2:48:40.960]  watch where the commodities investors are throwing their money and then run out real quick and buy
[2:48:40.960 --> 2:48:46.480]  that first then they will be right on target as to what the shortages are going to be next time
[2:48:47.120 --> 2:48:51.200]  in fact one of the things i'm going to do with my radio show is we're going to have a commodities
[2:48:51.200 --> 2:48:57.120]  issue that tells people what to buy for example if you know that they're selling off wheat and
[2:48:57.120 --> 2:49:01.600]  we've got bread lines on wheat folks go out and put in enough wheat you're going to it's going to
[2:49:01.600 --> 2:49:06.960]  take about 200 pounds of wheat in your storage to provide you a low a half a loaf of bread a day for
[2:49:06.960 --> 2:49:15.520]  a year for one adult okay that's information you can get from efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633
[2:49:15.520 --> 2:49:19.360]  yeah that's right you're also not just selling high quality freeze dried and and dehydrated

[3:01:14.520 --> 3:01:18.520]  And so we appreciate Jeffrey McKay from San Francisco Headline
[3:01:18.520 --> 3:01:22.520]  San Francisco sets precedent and imposes carbon tax on businesses
[3:01:22.520 --> 3:01:26.520]  But don't worry, it's a very small tax, kind of like your income tax started
[3:01:26.520 --> 3:01:30.520]  Mr. McKay, it is wonderful to have you on with us
[3:01:30.520 --> 3:01:33.520]  Thank you Alex, it's a pleasure to be on your station with you
[3:01:33.520 --> 3:01:39.520]  Good, I forgot to ask my producer, how long do we have you scheduled for?
[3:01:39.520 --> 3:01:41.520]  He said something like 15 minutes
[3:01:41.520 --> 3:01:44.520]  Oh that's perfect, we're about to break, I want to come back, how about till 20 after
[3:01:44.520 --> 3:01:48.520]  Sir, tell us about what San Francisco is doing and tell us about yourself
[3:01:48.520 --> 3:01:50.520]  And what type of officer you are
[3:01:50.520 --> 3:01:57.520]  Well certainly, the Bay Area Air Quality Management District was established a little over 50 years ago
[3:01:57.520 --> 3:02:06.520]  And at that time the state gave the authority to the Air Pollution Control Officer to permit polluting facilities in the Bay Area
[3:02:06.520 --> 3:02:09.520]  And my title is Deputy Air Pollution Control Officer
[3:02:09.520 --> 3:02:18.520]  So that means that I have that responsibility when our chief executive is not in the office
[3:02:18.520 --> 3:02:25.520]  So I've got a newscast reporting that it's basically bakeries, auto shops, just thousands of businesses
[3:02:25.520 --> 3:02:29.520]  What will be under this new umbrella?
[3:02:29.520 --> 3:02:36.520]  Well it's actually the same group of facilities that the Air District already regulates
[3:02:36.520 --> 3:02:38.520]  Excuse me, it has regulated for some time
[3:02:38.520 --> 3:02:41.520]  So it's about two and a half thousand facilities in the Bay Area
[3:02:41.520 --> 3:02:45.520]  All stationary sources, in other words meaning not cars for instance
[3:02:45.520 --> 3:02:50.520]  And it ranges anything from small backup generators in smaller facilities
[3:02:50.520 --> 3:02:53.520]  All the way up to the large refineries that we have in this area
[3:02:53.520 --> 3:03:01.520]  The vast majority of these groups are only paying fees of less than a dollar
[3:03:01.520 --> 3:03:05.520]  Yeah, but the income tax started real low too
[3:03:05.520 --> 3:03:12.520]  First we had voluntary emissions testing as they keep lowering and lowering and lowering until no one can pass
[3:03:12.520 --> 3:03:15.520]  And then of course it became mandatory and then they jacked it up
[3:03:15.520 --> 3:03:22.520]  We have 9,000 PhDs, 31,000 scientists who have signed saying carbon dioxide is good
[3:03:22.520 --> 3:03:29.520]  It reverses the expansion of deserts, plants like actually 10 times higher carbon dioxide that then produce higher oxygen
[3:03:29.520 --> 3:03:32.520]  All the ice core samples back 300,000 years, you're a course of physicist
[3:03:32.520 --> 3:03:36.520]  I'm wondering if you've looked into this, but I've had Nobel Prize winners and others on about it
[3:03:36.520 --> 3:03:41.520]  They're saying that carbon dioxide is one of the four elements of main life on this planet
[3:03:41.520 --> 3:03:45.520]  That's oxygen, carbon dioxide, solar radiation and water
[3:03:45.520 --> 3:03:50.520]  And this is a tax on breathing as the New York Times called it once they're done expanding it
[3:03:50.520 --> 3:03:54.520]  I mean, it's not proven that carbon dioxide is a devil weapon
[3:03:54.520 --> 3:03:57.520]  Why are you moving ahead with this?
[3:03:57.520 --> 3:04:02.520]  You know, certainly this is a field where research continues to be done
[3:04:02.520 --> 3:04:08.520]  And there are people with very defensible positions on different sides of the topic
[3:04:08.520 --> 3:04:12.520]  But what we're doing here is actually a very modest first step
[3:04:12.520 --> 3:04:24.520]  In other words, because we already have in place a system that regulates those emissions that are unquestionably bad for human health
[3:04:24.520 --> 3:04:32.520]  We're able to use that existing system to very efficiently, as I said, for only 4.4 cents per ton
[3:04:32.520 --> 3:04:38.520]  Produced an inventory of the emissions in the Bay Area
[3:04:38.520 --> 3:04:40.520]  Stay there, oh, a tracking, categorizing, and stay there, sir
[3:04:40.520 --> 3:04:43.520]  We're back in three short minutes of the final segment
[3:04:43.520 --> 3:04:48.520]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out
[3:04:48.520 --> 3:04:51.520]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested
[3:04:51.520 --> 3:04:55.520]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite
[3:04:55.520 --> 3:04:58.520]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore
[3:04:58.520 --> 3:05:04.520]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the disease that we see
[3:05:04.520 --> 3:05:09.520]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal formulas like Cardivite, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill
[3:05:09.520 --> 3:05:14.520]  Now, going for regular jobs a few months later, we know we're doing something right
[3:05:14.520 --> 3:05:19.520]  It's a well-thought-out formula, I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time
[3:05:19.520 --> 3:05:21.520]  And liver function is dead on
[3:05:21.520 --> 3:05:25.520]  You'll find, I think, that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems
[3:05:25.520 --> 3:05:27.520]  It'll work on other problems as well
[3:05:27.520 --> 3:05:32.520]  For more information, call 1-877-928-8822

[3:05:43.520 --> 3:05:48.520]  It is a big idea, a new world order
[3:05:48.520 --> 3:05:53.520]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government
[3:05:53.520 --> 3:05:58.520]  It's known as the Bilderberg, but their objective being world domination
[3:05:58.520 --> 3:06:01.520]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew
[3:06:01.520 --> 3:06:09.520]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand
[3:06:12.520 --> 3:06:17.520]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open
[3:06:17.520 --> 3:06:21.520]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda
[3:06:21.520 --> 3:06:24.520]  Bilderberg is making great progress toward a world government
[3:06:24.520 --> 3:06:27.520]  Most people have no idea, they're not after money, they have all the money they need
[3:06:27.520 --> 3:06:29.520]  They're after power, that's their affidavit

[3:06:38.520 --> 3:06:52.520]  Hi, my name is William Lewis, and if you're listening to this radio station, then chances are, you've probably seen one or two of the documentaries that I've made over the years
[3:06:52.520 --> 3:06:57.520]  911 in plain sight, beyond treason, or maybe 911 ripple effect
[3:06:57.520 --> 3:07:04.520]  And by now, you've got to be as angry as I am, and wondering, what else have they done, and what are we gonna do about it
[3:07:04.520 --> 3:07:09.520]  The latest documentary, Washington You're Fired, was made to explore these ideas of change
[3:07:09.520 --> 3:07:14.520]  While at the same time, exposing the scope of the president's immoral and illegal spy program
[3:07:14.520 --> 3:07:22.520]  We revealed the abuses committed under the protection of the Patriot Act, Military Commissions Act, and other very intrusive spy bills
[3:07:22.520 --> 3:07:30.520]  Washington You're Fired explores the removal of habeas corpus, posicumetatus, and the subversion of our entire Bill of Rights

[3:08:05.520 --> 3:08:10.520]  Huge breaking news at infowars.net
[3:08:10.520 --> 3:08:13.520]  Right now, if our guest leaves us about 15 minutes, we're gonna cover it
[3:08:13.520 --> 3:08:18.520]  Worst vaccine bill ever, seeks compulsory shots for all children
[3:08:18.520 --> 3:08:22.520]  They've never had a law, they've had to buffalo, intimidate, and lie
[3:08:22.520 --> 3:08:29.520]  Under color of law and felony color of law scams to get people to do it
[3:08:29.520 --> 3:08:33.520]  Now they're moving with the total police state, with their eugenics operation
[3:08:33.520 --> 3:08:39.520]  With a bunch of unwitting idiots in the system, have no idea what larger system they're in
[3:08:39.520 --> 3:08:44.520]  We're talking to Jeff McKay, he's deputy air pollution control officer
[3:08:44.520 --> 3:08:48.520]  And let's just play about a minute of this local newscast
[3:08:48.520 --> 3:08:53.520]  Go ahead and play some of that local newscast so people know what we're talking about here in San Francisco
[3:08:53.520 --> 3:09:00.520]  Area air pollution leaders are set to vote on an unprecedented pollution fee today for businesses that emit greenhouse gases
[3:09:00.520 --> 3:09:05.520]  Thousands of businesses would be impacted by that move, which is thought to be the first of its kind in the nation
[3:09:05.520 --> 3:09:11.520]  NBC 11's Christy Smith live now in San Francisco, where the Bay Area Quality Management District is meeting right now
[3:09:11.520 --> 3:09:12.520]  Christy?
[3:09:12.520 --> 3:09:16.520]  Good morning, Brent, I was just told moments ago that this was indeed approved
[3:09:16.520 --> 3:09:19.520]  They just took the vote about 15 minutes ago
[3:09:19.520 --> 3:09:23.520]  Now this will affect all sorts of businesses from bakeries to gas stations
[3:09:23.520 --> 3:09:27.520]  But certainly oil refineries in the Bay Area will be hit the hardest point on average
[3:09:27.520 --> 3:09:35.520]  Alright, now let me go back to our guest who is the deputy head of this operation
[3:09:35.520 --> 3:09:38.520]  Deputy Air Pollution Officer there in San Francisco
[3:09:38.520 --> 3:09:43.520]  Dr. McKay holds a PhD and applied physics from Yale University
[3:09:43.520 --> 3:09:48.520]  And of course comes to us from IBM where he was a chief information officer
[3:09:48.520 --> 3:09:51.520]  So let's go ahead and go back to him
[3:09:51.520 --> 3:09:56.520]  So you're now there, boy, you're pretty high powered smart guy
[3:09:56.520 --> 3:10:00.520]  They're now going to city government, why'd you decide to go there?
[3:10:00.520 --> 3:10:04.520]  Must be some big potentials there, important work you're doing, doctor?
[3:10:04.520 --> 3:10:08.520]  Well, you know, it's very satisfying work
[3:10:08.520 --> 3:10:16.520]  Silicon Valley was fun, but I certainly never mind telling people that I'm working to work on air quality
[3:10:16.520 --> 3:10:21.520]  I never mind having to admit that at a cocktail party
[3:10:21.520 --> 3:10:26.520]  It feels good, you're kind of like the new priesthood, I'm sure you've read a club of Rome documents
[3:10:26.520 --> 3:10:31.520]  You and biological diversity where they say the new religion will be carrying out environmentalism
[3:10:31.520 --> 3:10:37.520]  And that certainly is hailed there, do you kind of recognize you're part of the new priesthood?
[3:10:37.520 --> 3:10:42.520]  Oh, I don't think of it that way, I live here, I ride my bike here, I jog here
[3:10:42.520 --> 3:10:44.520]  Sacrament?
[3:10:44.520 --> 3:10:47.520]  It's just a day to day experience for me
[3:10:47.520 --> 3:10:53.520]  Do you ever work with Green Shield there at the Presidio who developed a lot of these ideas 25 years ago?
[3:10:53.520 --> 3:10:55.520]  Oh, I'm not familiar with them
[3:10:55.520 --> 3:11:03.520]  Well, I mean, here's the deal, have you read Richard and Haas, chairman of the CFR admitting that this is a way to control populations and regulate them
[3:11:03.520 --> 3:11:08.520]  And that in England and in the US, we're going to have a card we swipe that tracks our entire carbon footprint
[3:11:08.520 --> 3:11:10.520]  Are you aware of that?
[3:11:10.520 --> 3:11:22.520]  You know, I think that that's getting far, far ahead of what we are attempting to accomplish here, this is actually simply a small fee that's not supposed to be an incentive of any type
[3:11:22.520 --> 3:11:28.520]  And it's certainly not priced as an incentive, it's not a large enough fee to have any incentivizing effect
[3:11:28.520 --> 3:11:32.520]  Kind of like that half percent income tax, now what about the state?
[3:11:32.520 --> 3:11:42.520]  Lord Schwarzenegger, excuse me, Commander Schwarzenegger, Governor Schwarzenegger, the Gropinator, he is coming out with his own carbon taxes, isn't he?
[3:11:42.520 --> 3:11:53.520]  Well, I think you're referring to the California Air Resources Board, and it's absolutely true that the California Air Resources Board is mandated with moving ahead
[3:11:53.520 --> 3:12:02.520]  Looking at how greenhouse gas emissions are affecting the whole state, we have always worked closely with the Air Resources Board
[3:12:02.520 --> 3:12:11.520]  And we have in fact been requested by the Air Resources Board to provide greenhouse gas inventory information for several years, and we have been doing that
[3:12:11.520 --> 3:12:20.520]  And they've been very happy to receive it. Now going forward, if they do wish to start incentivizing actions with increased fees of some type
[3:12:20.520 --> 3:12:25.520]  We certainly would be completely coordinated with them on that, there would not be any overlap
[3:12:25.520 --> 3:12:40.520]  And in fact, if, as sometimes happens, they then use those fees to provide for coverage of the costs of the air districts, then we would be able to perhaps revisit our fees
[3:12:40.520 --> 3:12:51.520]  So you're not worried about overlap, because the way I've read this being written up by the policy makers, really it was codified by the early 90s, that you're going to have your local regional directorates, you're going to have your state
[3:12:51.520 --> 3:12:56.520]  And then larger regions, and then national and then international, all interlocking
[3:12:56.520 --> 3:13:04.520]  Now you can say air quality, it's one thing to say we want to reduce carbon monoxide, or we want catalytic converters, those are good things
[3:13:04.520 --> 3:13:13.520]  But now, this is all about, I mean, you're saying we can debate the science, and that it's still open for debate, though in Europe they're talking about outlawing
[3:13:13.520 --> 3:13:21.520]  And that's mainstream news today, sounds like freedom, sounds like a, I guess you'll be burned at the stake if you don't go along with it, the carbon dioxide is a deadly poison
[3:13:21.520 --> 3:13:29.520]  But you can go into crowds of people and give them the scientific name Doctor of Water, and they'll all, 99% in studies, will say ban water
[3:13:29.520 --> 3:13:40.520]  And so meanwhile, California has passed an initiative for massive genetic engineering, cross species engineering, things that the scientists I've had on, including a Nobel Prize winner on the subject
[3:13:40.520 --> 3:13:46.520]  Say it's very dangerous, stuff kind of like we see in the Andromeda strain, it's probably likely
[3:13:46.520 --> 3:13:53.520]  That's not a problem though, we've just got to do something about that carbon dioxide, and I've read industry saying 20 years ago they wanted to agree on that
[3:13:53.520 --> 3:14:04.520]  Because that's something that really isn't bad, meanwhile we're all diverted on that diversion while all these thousands of real things go on that really are hurting the environment and us individually
[3:14:04.520 --> 3:14:09.520]  Do you have any comments on that, or you're just separately implementing the first carbon tax in the country?
[3:14:09.520 --> 3:14:20.520]  Certainly, you know, those other topics are obviously fascinating, but in this case, I think it's important to point out that if we do want to make responsible decisions
[3:14:20.520 --> 3:14:35.520]  An informed decision about how to handle any possible problems associated with greenhouse gas emissions, then it's important that we at least understand how much greenhouse gas emissions are occurring in a variety of areas
[3:14:35.520 --> 3:14:58.520]  And the great thing about what's happened here with this very small modest first step is that by taking advantage of systems we already have in place to monitor unequivocally bad emissions from polluting facilities, we're able to inventory greenhouse gases
[3:14:58.520 --> 3:15:13.520]  Unequivocal, nobody's allowed to release fluorine, nobody's allowed to release any of these, it's all permitted and controlled, you're reading this and I'm reading what the law you guys passed in the city, it's right here in front of me, this is for carbon dioxide and methane
[3:15:13.520 --> 3:15:29.520]  To clarify what I'm saying, because we regulate these other gases that everyone agrees are actually bad for human health, because we already have the system in place to regulate these other gases, we're for a very nominal fee able to also provide an inventory of greenhouse gases
[3:15:29.520 --> 3:15:44.520]  Not for a cost that is prohibitive to anybody, for a very low cost, and then the further work deciding should we really then take steps that would incentivize people one way or another, further work then can be done in an informed manner
[3:15:44.520 --> 3:15:59.520]  Because with the corporate Delphi training and all that, go in, calmly announce it, hey it's very small and then we'll look at later the next step, everything's alright and people hear the hot head guy versus the calm doctor who's there
[3:15:59.520 --> 3:16:20.520]  I mean come on, you know that you're building the bureaucracy and the measuring facilities and the measuring trainees as the model for the rest of the country to go around and then jack up these taxes on an inert life giving gas, because you can't tax people's houses because there's no fluorine or radon or anything that really is bad coming out of there
[3:16:20.520 --> 3:16:35.520]  This is a way to tax basic carbon and to control the planet and I mean do you agree as I hear on NPR that we're consuming too much and we've got to cut down our carbon footprint and we've got to stop being so wasteful consumers
[3:16:35.520 --> 3:16:45.520]  I mean that's kind of the mantra of the mid-level people that are pro-generating all of this or do you disagree with me doctor, I mean let's get down to brass tax
[3:16:45.520 --> 3:16:59.520]  Sure you know actually as a matter of fact we're not even authorized to tax, we're only authorized to collect fees that relate to the cost that we incur to inventory these emissions and to interact with other government agencies
[3:16:59.520 --> 3:17:04.520]  But to have the measuring mechanism is the step to a tax and a fee is a tax
[3:17:04.520 --> 3:17:16.520]  Well the great thing is that the measuring mechanisms we use to measure pollutants that everyone agrees are bad for human health are in fact the identical measurement techniques to allow us then to calculate greenhouse gas emissions
[3:17:16.520 --> 3:17:27.520]  So in fact we don't have to put in place any new measurement techniques to provide this inventory and that's why we're proud of the efficiency that we've brought to this process
[3:17:27.520 --> 3:17:38.520]  The efficiency of this process, so what do you think about the British model where they're all going to carry carbon cards that tracks, see I have a problem with them also tracking and surveilling my purchases and what I do
[3:17:38.520 --> 3:17:47.520]  They're talking about under socialized healthcare what we each going to be tracked and then because we're all communally paying for it and so I should have to pay more because I eat Bluebell ice cream
[3:17:47.520 --> 3:17:50.520]  I mean where do you see all that going doctor
[3:17:50.520 --> 3:17:58.520]  You know that's certainly that's a fascinating topic and it extends so far beyond what the air district is doing here
[3:17:58.520 --> 3:18:10.520]  You're talking about measures that are meant to affect people's behavior and so it's so important that I emphasize again that all we are doing here is helping provide the information
[3:18:10.520 --> 3:18:13.520]  Wait a minute the city ban bottled water in city buildings
[3:18:13.520 --> 3:18:22.520]  Oh that's true oh you're not involved in behavior and of course that's a set you know that is a ritual to the behavioral psychologist to train you to be under control
[3:18:22.520 --> 3:18:32.520]  People who normally wouldn't be under criminal jurisdiction to train us to have interaction with our new minders and bosses in England already going door to door the children bossing the parents around
[3:18:32.520 --> 3:18:43.520]  The CFR sir you may not have read it says this is about enslaving us and says this is about control they're so arrogant and you know what the CFR is don't you doctor
[3:18:43.520 --> 3:18:51.520]  You know it's funny because living in San Francisco I don't generally think of our population as being exorbitantly under control
[3:18:51.520 --> 3:18:56.520]  Oh no they don't care if you dress up like a woman and run around with your Johnson dragging the ground
[3:18:56.520 --> 3:19:03.520]  But they don't want you to not vaccinate your children or own a firearm
[3:19:03.520 --> 3:19:06.520]  Well there are people with a variety of opinions on that
[3:19:06.520 --> 3:19:12.520]  But see that's the behavioral psychologist control mechanism is they give you pathetic mindless rights that don't matter
[3:19:12.520 --> 3:19:16.520]  But you understand they make those your special goodies
[3:19:16.520 --> 3:19:23.520]  But then if I try to demonstrate in most cities I think San Francisco is more lenient there with a sign saying I'm against Bush I get arrested
[3:19:23.520 --> 3:19:27.520]  Because I'm in such a by the way you know Bush is now supporting the greenhouse tax you know that right
[3:19:27.520 --> 3:19:34.520]  Well he has acknowledged that in fact greenhouse gases emitted by human beings are affecting the climate that is true
[3:19:34.520 --> 3:19:40.520]  But you just said earlier the science is still out on that one more segment quick break doctor we really appreciate you coming on
[3:19:40.520 --> 3:19:44.520]  I want you to tell me about other city programs like banning the water bottles
[3:19:44.520 --> 3:19:51.520]  Terror storm a history of government sponsored terror loose change final cut in game blueprint for global enslavement
[3:19:51.520 --> 3:19:56.520]  The true story of the Bilderberg group the late great USA America freedom to fascism

[3:20:51.520 --> 3:20:54.520]  There are many ideas about the mark of the beast and the antichrist
[3:20:54.520 --> 3:21:02.520]  What do you know about the beast its mark and the antichrist is the beast a superpower nation or a giant computer in Belgium
[3:21:02.520 --> 3:21:10.520]  Is its mark an implanted chip a tattoo the national ID card or 666 is the antichrist a person title or both
[3:21:10.520 --> 3:21:14.520]  Some believe these things are in the future others believe that it's in the past
[3:21:14.520 --> 3:21:22.520]  First John states the antichrist is already in the world what is the truth and what is a lie are you willing to search God's word for the truth
[3:21:22.520 --> 3:21:31.520]  Friends these answers are in the Bible for free books DVDs and Bible studies exposing the antichrist the beast and its mark right to the Bible says

[3:21:57.520 --> 3:22:01.520]  For years Ron Paul has taken the position to uphold constitutional rights
[3:22:01.520 --> 3:22:05.520]  He's been branded by special interest groups as Dr. Noel refusing to bend his values
[3:22:05.520 --> 3:22:10.520]  I could only imagine the pressure applied by Congress as he stands alone for these principles
[3:22:10.520 --> 3:22:12.520]  He has given up a medical career for this
[3:22:12.520 --> 3:22:20.520]  Ron Paul is running for president the ideas of strong currency ending the war defending the Constitution and protecting civil liberties are catching on

[3:23:57.520 --> 3:24:00.520]  By the way our money bomb has already exploded
[3:24:00.520 --> 3:24:04.520]  Later I'm going to tell you all how much has already poured in in the last few hours
[3:24:04.520 --> 3:24:07.520]  Looks like it's going to be bigger than I thought it was
[3:24:08.520 --> 3:24:11.520]  Yeah I'm taking fight
[3:24:15.520 --> 3:24:17.520]  Alright I appreciate him coming on
[3:24:17.520 --> 3:24:20.520]  As we blast out on the MNFM dial
[3:24:20.520 --> 3:24:24.520]  Global satellite the internet at infowars.com
[3:24:25.520 --> 3:24:28.520]  And world by shortwave all the ships at sea
[3:24:28.520 --> 3:24:33.520]  Jeffrey McKay deputy air pollution officer
[3:24:33.520 --> 3:24:38.520]  Alright there is a fortune to be made in all of this
[3:24:38.520 --> 3:24:43.520]  They're estimating over a trillion dollars a year once it's implemented in western Europe
[3:24:43.520 --> 3:24:49.520]  And the United States as well as Canada they're able to start taxing all of the different carbon emissions
[3:24:49.520 --> 3:24:53.520]  Sir so you said you could just talk to me about the carbon program
[3:24:53.520 --> 3:24:58.520]  What's the time frame now as you measure carbon with this fee that's not a tax
[3:24:58.520 --> 3:25:05.520]  And then how long till we hear what your people in city government are going to go forward with
[3:25:05.520 --> 3:25:09.520]  So the fee will become effective on July 1st
[3:25:09.520 --> 3:25:13.520]  And we regularly send out our permits
[3:25:13.520 --> 3:25:18.520]  Again this is a fee for facilities that we already regulate
[3:25:18.520 --> 3:25:23.520]  The district's mission for over 50 years has been monitoring and regulating emissions
[3:25:23.520 --> 3:25:27.520]  From stationary sources in the Bay Area so that means not cars and trucks
[3:25:27.520 --> 3:25:34.520]  And so we're able to efficiently add this greenhouse gas fee to the permits that we send out to these folks
[3:25:34.520 --> 3:25:36.520]  Already on a yearly basis
[3:25:36.520 --> 3:25:40.520]  It's so easy it's so small just let us set the precedent
[3:25:40.520 --> 3:25:46.520]  Well you know actually if this is a precedent it would be a great precedent
[3:25:46.520 --> 3:25:50.520]  In terms of people saving money for inventory and greenhouse gas emissions
[3:25:50.520 --> 3:25:54.520]  If the rest of the country could inventory their greenhouse gas emissions
[3:25:54.520 --> 3:25:57.520]  At this price that would be a wonderful thing
[3:25:57.520 --> 3:26:01.520]  That's a great spin kind of like when they say in England you all have your carbon slave card
[3:26:01.520 --> 3:26:05.520]  It's going to make you money well only if you live under a bridge you can sell your credits that way
[3:26:05.520 --> 3:26:09.520]  The average person is going to be paying huge amounts you're doing something that costs money
[3:26:09.520 --> 3:26:12.520]  You're saying it's not a tax doctor it is it's to set everything up
[3:26:12.520 --> 3:26:16.520]  And then now you're saying oh this would save money to inventory
[3:26:16.520 --> 3:26:21.520]  Yeah that's if we're going to adopt some type of taxing system you can claim yours is really cheap
[3:26:21.520 --> 3:26:26.520]  Because you introduce it small you know they always introduce sales taxes and property taxes
[3:26:26.520 --> 3:26:30.520]  And in state income taxes at one half of one percent
[3:26:30.520 --> 3:26:33.520]  And then they jack it up overnight commander
[3:26:33.520 --> 3:26:39.520]  You know if there is going to be any sort of tax or fee put in place
[3:26:39.520 --> 3:26:43.520]  That would incentivize people one way or another it's so important that that be done
[3:26:43.520 --> 3:26:48.520]  From a basis of having a good understanding of the emissions that already exist
[3:26:48.520 --> 3:26:54.520]  And so again it's so important to emphasize that this fee is really just covering the cost
[3:26:54.520 --> 3:26:56.520]  Of inventorying the emissions in the bay area
[3:26:56.520 --> 3:26:59.520]  I understand that's a good talking point doc here's the deal
[3:26:59.520 --> 3:27:04.520]  I would have greenie weenies on who don't care about the real environment just making money
[3:27:04.520 --> 3:27:07.520]  We all know or their cult members I would have them on this show
[3:27:07.520 --> 3:27:11.520]  And they would A. say carbon dioxide is a deadly deadly thing
[3:27:11.520 --> 3:27:16.520]  B. they would then go on to say there's no plan for the tax that I'm a big liar
[3:27:16.520 --> 3:27:19.520]  Meanwhile all their documents said it now the taxes are happening
[3:27:19.520 --> 3:27:21.520]  And you're still saying it's not a tax
[3:27:21.520 --> 3:27:26.520]  Well I'm talking about what the Bay Area Air Quality Management District is doing here
[3:27:26.520 --> 3:27:27.520]  What you're calling it
[3:27:27.520 --> 3:27:33.520]  If other agencies do want to proceed with any sort of fear tax
[3:27:33.520 --> 3:27:35.520]  That would be large enough to actually incentivize people
[3:27:35.520 --> 3:27:38.520]  It's so important that it'd be done with the proper information
[3:27:38.520 --> 3:27:40.520]  But a rose is still a rose by any other name
[3:27:40.520 --> 3:27:42.520]  Is your fee a tax?
[3:27:42.520 --> 3:27:46.520]  No no it's actually a very clear definition
[3:27:46.520 --> 3:27:48.520]  We're not authorized to issue taxes
[3:27:48.520 --> 3:27:52.520]  We're only authorized to issue fees for cost recovery for work that we do
[3:27:52.520 --> 3:27:57.520]  So the San Francisco Chronicle and the TV stations they all got it wrong
[3:27:57.520 --> 3:28:00.520]  When they said greenhouse gas tax
[3:28:00.520 --> 3:28:02.520]  That's correct they should have said fee
[3:28:02.520 --> 3:28:06.520]  Oh okay well I'm beginning to understand now
[3:28:06.520 --> 3:28:12.520]  Doctor now just explain to me though Al Gore has said before congress it is a tax
[3:28:12.520 --> 3:28:17.520]  What he's proposing two different ones do you support that in the larger just as a citizen?
[3:28:17.520 --> 3:28:25.520]  You know I am so focused on making sure the decisions are made with the best possible information
[3:28:25.520 --> 3:28:30.520]  And so at this stage of the game you know taking this first modest step
[3:28:30.520 --> 3:28:32.520]  It's all about providing that information
[3:28:32.520 --> 3:28:34.520]  That's exactly what we're doing
[3:28:34.520 --> 3:28:38.520]  One small step for man, one giant leap for slave masters worldwide
[3:28:38.520 --> 3:28:40.520]  Well that would be a large step
[3:28:40.520 --> 3:28:42.520]  4.4 cents per ton
[3:28:42.520 --> 3:28:49.520]  And that provides us with an inventory of carbon, dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions in the Bay Area
[3:28:49.520 --> 3:28:54.520]  Which then can be used to make hopefully the best possible decision
[3:28:54.520 --> 3:28:57.520]  And then that will fund the larger cadres of enforcers
[3:28:57.520 --> 3:29:02.520]  They've got all these control freak weenies that are slicing tires all over Austin and knocking SUV windows out
[3:29:02.520 --> 3:29:05.520]  God they're going to have badges and guns it's going to be hellish
[3:29:05.520 --> 3:29:07.520]  Give us the website for the city
[3:29:07.520 --> 3:29:16.520]  Sure the website for the Bay Area Quality Management District is baaqmd.gov
[3:29:16.520 --> 3:29:22.520]  Doc I want to challenge you to go read about the Club of Rome, Richard and Haas CFR documents
[3:29:22.520 --> 3:29:24.520]  It's all a big fraud, all a big scam
[3:29:24.520 --> 3:29:28.520]  And I don't think you mean bad but I think you need to deprogram yourself and maybe get another job
[3:29:28.520 --> 3:29:30.520]  Okay Doc?
[3:29:30.520 --> 3:29:32.520]  You know it's too much money in it, right? It's too powerful
[3:29:32.520 --> 3:29:55.520]  Thank you for joining us
[3:30:02.520 --> 3:30:05.520]  Tomorrow may be too late

[3:30:56.520 --> 3:31:00.520]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation
[3:31:00.520 --> 3:31:03.520]  In which family members receive answers to their questions
[3:31:03.520 --> 3:31:07.520]  And the true perpetrators of the horrendous crime are brought to justice

[3:31:11.520 --> 3:31:15.520]  From hijackers being trained at US military bases to bombs in the buildings

[3:31:37.520 --> 3:31:43.520]  Truth is our weapon and prisonplanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother
[3:31:43.520 --> 3:31:47.520]  Hi this is Alex Jones and I want to talk to you about the high price of gasoline
[3:31:47.520 --> 3:31:52.520]  It's no secret that gasoline quality is poor even though we're paying record prices at the pump
[3:31:52.520 --> 3:31:57.520]  I have run across a company called SFR who has developed two products that improve gas mileage
[3:31:57.520 --> 3:32:01.520]  Instead of paying a mechanic as much as $300 to clean your injection system
[3:32:01.520 --> 3:32:06.520]  Protect a complete fuel system treatment cleans to 95% of new engine condition
[3:32:06.520 --> 3:32:08.520]  Improving mileage in only one tank full
[3:32:08.520 --> 3:32:13.520]  Protect an engine treatment not only reduces friction but it extends the life of your engine
[3:32:13.520 --> 3:32:17.520]  Let's face it with the high price of gasoline it's time to take action
[3:32:17.520 --> 3:32:22.520]  Purchase a protective fuel system treatment for only $9.95 and receive a free engine treatment
[3:32:22.520 --> 3:32:25.520]  Which is a $12.95 value free
[3:32:25.520 --> 3:32:27.520]  Call Triple 8 use SFR 1
[3:32:27.520 --> 3:32:31.520]  That number again is Triple 8 use SFR 1
[3:32:31.520 --> 3:32:34.520]  Or check them out online at OilCompanySecret.com
[3:32:34.520 --> 3:32:36.520]  That's OilCompanySecret.com

[3:32:42.520 --> 3:32:50.520]  Guess what's happened?
[3:33:00.520 --> 3:33:05.520]  $15,000 has come in in the last few hours
[3:33:05.520 --> 3:33:10.520]  And we haven't even gone through the mail yet that's pouring in this week
[3:33:10.520 --> 3:33:12.520]  For the money bomb
[3:33:12.520 --> 3:33:14.520]  Starting to night at midnight
[3:33:14.520 --> 3:33:17.520]  We'll be posting the numbers
[3:33:17.520 --> 3:33:24.520]  As the disgusting fiat currency pours in
[3:33:24.520 --> 3:33:27.520]  And then we will take that filth, that evil
[3:33:27.520 --> 3:33:31.520]  And through the process of infowars alchemy
[3:33:31.520 --> 3:33:37.520]  It will come out the back end of this ICBM as propellant
[3:33:37.520 --> 3:33:45.520]  As this missile lifts off the pad to destroy more of the enemy's lives
[3:33:45.520 --> 3:33:51.520]  Guess what I learned during the little three minute break
[3:33:51.520 --> 3:33:55.520]  I just learned that I have a new tax here in Texas
[3:33:55.520 --> 3:33:58.520]  About two years ago somebody showed up threatening us saying
[3:33:58.520 --> 3:34:02.520]  You owe money, there's a new regional emergency tax
[3:34:02.520 --> 3:34:05.520]  For an inventory, whatever things were if you have to let me in
[3:34:05.520 --> 3:34:07.520]  And I said no, I said give me some paperwork
[3:34:07.520 --> 3:34:10.520]  I called, found out it was a new tax
[3:34:10.520 --> 3:34:12.520]  Had the little creature back
[3:34:12.520 --> 3:34:15.520]  And they said this file cabinet's worth $10,000
[3:34:15.520 --> 3:34:18.520]  I'm like that's a $200 file cabinet maybe
[3:34:18.520 --> 3:34:20.520]  This computer's worth $20,000
[3:34:20.520 --> 3:34:24.520]  I'm like no, that's like a four year old maybe $800 computer when we bought it
[3:34:24.520 --> 3:34:27.520]  I go on my taxes, I probably got that listed as $100
[3:34:27.520 --> 3:34:29.520]  It's been depreciated, this is worth that
[3:34:29.520 --> 3:34:32.520]  This is where you owe $20,000
[3:34:32.520 --> 3:34:34.520]  They've got some inventory tax
[3:34:34.520 --> 3:34:38.520]  And then some other bureaucrat last year just showed up banging on the door
[3:34:38.520 --> 3:34:40.520]  Let me in here, there's a new tax
[3:34:40.520 --> 3:34:44.520]  Well I've now been informed there's a new franchise tax
[3:34:44.520 --> 3:34:45.520]  I remember hearing something about it
[3:34:45.520 --> 3:34:48.520]  It's only 1% of our entire total gross
[3:34:48.520 --> 3:34:52.520]  Of course you know that'll be jacked up to 10, 15, 20%
[3:34:52.520 --> 3:34:55.520]  There's cops everywhere, just everywhere riding tickets
[3:34:55.520 --> 3:35:01.520]  I mean just every road, everywhere motorcycles, police cars, trucks, just feeding
[3:35:01.520 --> 3:35:04.520]  Everybody's going bankrupt, falling apart, everything's gyrating up
[3:35:04.520 --> 3:35:07.520]  They're building more prisons, more stations, more surveillance
[3:35:07.520 --> 3:35:10.520]  Drones, control, just frothing, enjoying themselves
[3:35:10.520 --> 3:35:12.520]  Oh it's so good
[3:35:15.520 --> 3:35:18.520]  It's a good thing I don't care much about Federal Reserve notes
[3:35:18.520 --> 3:35:22.520]  But see as they jack the taxes up more and more and more we won't even be able to operate
[3:35:22.520 --> 3:35:27.520]  And people said well you should be 501C3, I actually had a millionaire call me up
[3:35:27.520 --> 3:35:29.520]  Well known, a lot of money, a lot more than a million
[3:35:29.520 --> 3:35:31.520]  I don't want to say how much they're like I want to give me a bunch of money
[3:35:31.520 --> 3:35:33.520]  And I said well take your time, don't do that right now
[3:35:33.520 --> 3:35:37.520]  You understand I'm not 501C3 and it's not going to be tax exempt
[3:35:37.520 --> 3:35:39.520]  Your lawyers aren't going to like it
[3:35:39.520 --> 3:35:42.520]  I just say that because it tortures other talk shows
[3:35:42.520 --> 3:35:44.520]  That's right I turned down money
[3:35:45.520 --> 3:35:48.520]  I don't care, you understand I really don't
[3:35:48.520 --> 3:35:52.520]  I don't want enough money to live and take care of myself and operate
[3:35:52.520 --> 3:35:55.520]  And I realize everybody else basically worships it
[3:35:55.520 --> 3:36:00.520]  And to me I just know it's not going to matter soon because this is an economy where
[3:36:00.520 --> 3:36:03.520]  It's about you not being able to open a new business
[3:36:03.520 --> 3:36:06.520]  It's about you not being able to operate unless you're a fortune 500
[3:36:06.520 --> 3:36:12.520]  That's in on the carbon tax scam and got good old boy back up hookups in the establishment
[3:36:12.520 --> 3:36:15.520]  With these international boards and you're just not going to have a business
[3:36:15.520 --> 3:36:16.520]  You're not going to have a job
[3:36:16.520 --> 3:36:19.520]  You understand this is a shift into total tyranny
[3:36:19.520 --> 3:36:21.520]  Economic tyranny
[3:36:21.520 --> 3:36:26.520]  Now a lot of you think no it's about brown al-Qaeda and I'm a knight to the Ku Klux Klan
[3:36:26.520 --> 3:36:29.520]  And I want to kill brown people
[3:36:29.520 --> 3:36:31.520]  Well let me tell you something you're racist dirtbags
[3:36:31.520 --> 3:36:33.520]  This is for you
[3:36:33.520 --> 3:36:35.520]  This is for you
[3:36:35.520 --> 3:36:37.520]  I want to tell the racist la rica on quichitas
[3:36:37.520 --> 3:36:41.520]  You call me a fat gringo pig on my own website
[3:36:41.520 --> 3:36:43.520]  While calling me a racist
[3:36:43.520 --> 3:36:45.520]  You racist fat gringo pig
[3:36:45.520 --> 3:36:47.520]  Ha ha ha, viva la riza
[3:36:47.520 --> 3:36:50.520]  No I'm not the one talking about my race
[3:36:50.520 --> 3:36:53.520]  And how you're going to you know how I'm going to take you over
[3:36:53.520 --> 3:36:55.520]  You understand you're losing too
[3:36:55.520 --> 3:36:56.520]  The new world order is getting you
[3:36:56.520 --> 3:36:58.520]  They're poisoning your kids every day with the water
[3:36:58.520 --> 3:37:00.520]  They're shooting them up every day
[3:37:00.520 --> 3:37:03.520]  I want all the dumb white races to know
[3:37:03.520 --> 3:37:06.520]  All the Mexican races, all the black races to know
[3:37:06.520 --> 3:37:08.520]  Well you're all fighting with each other
[3:37:08.520 --> 3:37:11.520]  The new world order is going to town on you
[3:37:14.520 --> 3:37:16.520]  Now the news here
[3:37:16.520 --> 3:37:20.520]  Is Steve Watson incredible article
[3:37:20.520 --> 3:37:24.520]  By the way he has a PHD in political science
[3:37:24.520 --> 3:37:27.520]  Which normally are worthless but Steve put it his to use
[3:37:27.520 --> 3:37:29.520]  Worst vaccine bill ever
[3:37:29.520 --> 3:37:34.520]  Seeks compulsory shots for all of the children
[3:37:34.520 --> 3:37:37.520]  Activist group calls for defense of right to exemption in New York state
[3:37:37.520 --> 3:37:40.520]  See first they say oh well there's no law
[3:37:40.520 --> 3:37:42.520]  But we'd like you to fill out an exemption form
[3:37:42.520 --> 3:37:45.520]  That then popularizes it's the law
[3:37:45.520 --> 3:37:47.520]  Okay
[3:37:47.520 --> 3:37:50.520]  And just like gun permits for concealed carry
[3:37:50.520 --> 3:37:52.520]  There's no law you've got to have one to own a gun in Texas
[3:37:52.520 --> 3:37:54.520]  But now people think that
[3:37:54.520 --> 3:37:55.520]  Like New York started out with
[3:37:55.520 --> 3:37:58.520]  Yeah you just got us $5 is what it started with in the 40s
[3:37:58.520 --> 3:38:01.520]  Just fill out a form, mail it in
[3:38:01.520 --> 3:38:03.520]  And you got a gun permit
[3:38:03.520 --> 3:38:05.520]  Okay
[3:38:05.520 --> 3:38:08.520]  And it's just so we can get these illegals that are coming in from Europe
[3:38:08.520 --> 3:38:11.520]  And you know they got guns and they're too dumb to do it
[3:38:11.520 --> 3:38:13.520]  And so they play the race card
[3:38:13.520 --> 3:38:15.520]  Yeah we want that
[3:38:15.520 --> 3:38:18.520]  And then now nobody's got guns
[3:38:18.520 --> 3:38:21.520]  Except the corrupt system and mob bosses who can pay 30 grand on average
[3:38:21.520 --> 3:38:23.520]  And political contributions to the sheriff and police chief
[3:38:23.520 --> 3:38:25.520]  To be authorized to have a gun
[3:38:25.520 --> 3:38:27.520]  A right turns into a privilege
[3:38:27.520 --> 3:38:29.520]  And so they tell you
[3:38:29.520 --> 3:38:31.520]  I mean you show up at the hospital now they just take your kids blood
[3:38:31.520 --> 3:38:33.520]  And we've been telling you about it for a decade
[3:38:33.520 --> 3:38:34.520]  Now they admit yeah
[3:38:34.520 --> 3:38:36.520]  We take your blood and it goes to Homeland Security
[3:38:36.520 --> 3:38:38.520]  Before it was that it goes to the FBI
[3:38:38.520 --> 3:38:42.520]  And we also use it for genetic engineering
[3:38:42.520 --> 3:38:44.520]  Period
[3:38:44.520 --> 3:38:45.520]  And Bush signs a bill
[3:38:45.520 --> 3:38:46.520]  We woke enough people up
[3:38:46.520 --> 3:38:47.520]  People got mad about it
[3:38:47.520 --> 3:38:48.520]  It became a big issue at the state level
[3:38:48.520 --> 3:38:50.520]  Bush just signed a federal bill
[3:38:50.520 --> 3:38:52.520]  Three weeks ago saying we'll take your blood at birth
[3:38:52.520 --> 3:38:54.520]  DNA database
[3:38:54.520 --> 3:38:56.520]  That matter was still crimes retroactively
[3:38:56.520 --> 3:38:58.520]  What they did
[3:38:58.520 --> 3:39:00.520]  It didn't protect them from the prior stuff
[3:39:00.520 --> 3:39:02.520]  Like his spy bill does
[3:39:02.520 --> 3:39:03.520]  God they're lawless
[3:39:03.520 --> 3:39:07.520]  I mean you start really thinking about how lawless this trash is
[3:39:07.520 --> 3:39:10.520]  When you start really thinking about what they're doing
[3:39:10.520 --> 3:39:12.520]  How they're operating
[3:39:12.520 --> 3:39:14.520]  The things they're up to
[3:39:14.520 --> 3:39:16.520]  I mean it's just any criminal scam they can run
[3:39:16.520 --> 3:39:17.520]  They're gonna do it
[3:39:17.520 --> 3:39:18.520]  Now let me explain
[3:39:18.520 --> 3:39:19.520]  This is all eugenics
[3:39:19.520 --> 3:39:21.520]  The carbon tax, the regulation, everything
[3:39:21.520 --> 3:39:26.520]  And it's about giving total control to that one half of one percent
[3:39:26.520 --> 3:39:29.520]  A pending New York state bill
[3:39:29.520 --> 3:39:32.520]  Dubbed the worst vaccine bill ever by one activist group
[3:39:32.520 --> 3:39:33.520]  Would see all vaccines
[3:39:33.520 --> 3:39:35.520]  Let's get them set up for Bernman's next week
[3:39:35.520 --> 3:39:37.520]  When he's sitting in when I'm out of town
[3:39:37.520 --> 3:39:38.520]  The bill to birth
[3:39:38.520 --> 3:39:41.520]  All vaccines recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
[3:39:41.520 --> 3:39:42.520]  And they add like five a year now
[3:39:42.520 --> 3:39:43.520]  It's like forty something
[3:39:43.520 --> 3:39:46.520]  CDC made mandatory for all children
[3:39:46.520 --> 3:39:48.520]  Including infants and toddlers
[3:39:48.520 --> 3:39:50.520]  God they'll give your kid a shot
[3:39:50.520 --> 3:39:52.520]  They'll have a seizure on the spot
[3:39:52.520 --> 3:39:54.520]  And then they'll swat team you saying you shook the baby
[3:39:54.520 --> 3:39:57.520]  That's their new little game they've been playing for about five years
[3:39:57.520 --> 3:40:00.520]  Now assembly bill 10942
[3:40:00.520 --> 3:40:02.520]  They got sick they are
[3:40:02.520 --> 3:40:04.520]  They got dumb cops
[3:40:04.520 --> 3:40:06.520]  Brain damage themselves from shots their whole life
[3:40:06.520 --> 3:40:08.520]  And they just like drooling
[3:40:08.520 --> 3:40:09.520]  Take your kitty
[3:40:09.520 --> 3:40:11.520]  You kid have a seizure after the shot
[3:40:11.520 --> 3:40:13.520]  You beat them up
[3:40:13.520 --> 3:40:15.520]  Oh, beating them up
[3:40:15.520 --> 3:40:17.520]  It's micro lesions from mercury on their brain
[3:40:17.520 --> 3:40:19.520]  Oh, it's not in there
[3:40:19.520 --> 3:40:20.520]  Oh, it is in there
[3:40:20.520 --> 3:40:21.520]  Oh, it's good for me
[3:40:21.520 --> 3:40:22.520]  No, it's never been in there
[3:40:22.520 --> 3:40:23.520]  Now it's out of there
[3:40:23.520 --> 3:40:24.520]  Oh, it's actually in there
[3:40:24.520 --> 3:40:25.520]  And it's caused brain damage
[3:40:25.520 --> 3:40:26.520]  But we're going to make you take it
[3:40:26.520 --> 3:40:28.520]  Introduced at the request of Richard Danes
[3:40:28.520 --> 3:40:30.520]  The Commissioner of New York State Department of Health
[3:40:30.520 --> 3:40:32.520]  Calls for changes of the law
[3:40:32.520 --> 3:40:34.520]  In order to make recommended inoculation
[3:40:34.520 --> 3:40:36.520]  Because see the hoax, it's now been exposed
[3:40:36.520 --> 3:40:37.520]  That it was a hoax
[3:40:37.520 --> 3:40:39.520]  And that was getting them about 95%
[3:40:39.520 --> 3:40:40.520]  But now the hoax is over
[3:40:40.520 --> 3:40:42.520]  The criminals hoax is over
[3:40:42.520 --> 3:40:44.520]  See, there's no law
[3:40:44.520 --> 3:40:46.520]  They're criminals
[3:40:46.520 --> 3:40:47.520]  What does it take?
[3:40:47.520 --> 3:40:50.520]  A government that lies all the time
[3:40:50.520 --> 3:40:52.520]  To you
[3:40:55.520 --> 3:40:58.520]  I care about you, you idiot police
[3:40:58.520 --> 3:41:00.520]  You idiot school teachers
[3:41:00.520 --> 3:41:01.520]  You idiot Americans
[3:41:01.520 --> 3:41:03.520]  Stop being idiots
[3:41:03.520 --> 3:41:05.520]  Stop it!
[3:41:07.520 --> 3:41:09.520]  I've had hundreds of guests and scientists
[3:41:09.520 --> 3:41:10.520]  And doctors on
[3:41:10.520 --> 3:41:11.520]  I've read all the source documents
[3:41:11.520 --> 3:41:13.520]  I've played clips of the father
[3:41:13.520 --> 3:41:15.520]  Of the polio vaccine
[3:41:15.520 --> 3:41:17.520]  Admitting it had cancer viruses in it
[3:41:17.520 --> 3:41:19.520]  And more and AIDS, HIV
[3:41:19.520 --> 3:41:21.520]  I've proven it, they're killing you, dude
[3:41:21.520 --> 3:41:23.520]  Why do you want to die?
[3:41:23.520 --> 3:41:25.520]  Why do you want to believe their lies?
[3:41:25.520 --> 3:41:27.520]  What is your problem?
[3:41:27.520 --> 3:41:30.520]  What is your major malfunction?
[3:41:33.520 --> 3:41:35.520]  You want to thank God for me
[3:41:35.520 --> 3:41:36.520]  Up here warning you
[3:41:36.520 --> 3:41:38.520]  That I've still got my head screwed on
[3:41:38.520 --> 3:41:40.520]  Straight and I'm angry and upset
[3:41:42.520 --> 3:41:45.520]  Folks, I have got as much instinct as a cow
[3:41:45.520 --> 3:41:47.520]  Humans used to have the best instincts
[3:41:47.520 --> 3:41:48.520]  The smartest, the most cunning
[3:41:48.520 --> 3:41:49.520]  The best sixth sense
[3:41:49.520 --> 3:41:51.520]  You've had it bred out of you
[3:41:51.520 --> 3:41:53.520]  Engineered out of you, poisoned out of you
[3:41:53.520 --> 3:41:54.520]  You get a bunch of cows
[3:41:54.520 --> 3:41:57.520]  At the slaughterhouse
[3:41:57.520 --> 3:42:00.520]  And that's why they get them in tiny squeeze shoots
[3:42:00.520 --> 3:42:02.520]  And then only bring them into the main slaughter area
[3:42:02.520 --> 3:42:04.520]  One at a time and most plants
[3:42:04.520 --> 3:42:06.520]  And they usually got an air gun
[3:42:06.520 --> 3:42:08.520]  Fires a bolt into their head
[3:42:08.520 --> 3:42:10.520]  Because if you get other cows in there
[3:42:10.520 --> 3:42:12.520]  And they see that going on
[3:42:12.520 --> 3:42:13.520]  They'll go nuts
[3:42:13.520 --> 3:42:15.520]  Nuts like you've never seen
[3:42:15.520 --> 3:42:17.520]  Breaking their legs, ramming through things
[3:42:17.520 --> 3:42:20.520]  Doing things, a cow will fight back
[3:42:20.520 --> 3:42:22.520]  And that's all I'm doing folks
[3:42:22.520 --> 3:42:24.520]  I'm in the chute just slobbering
[3:42:24.520 --> 3:42:25.520]  And freaking out
[3:42:25.520 --> 3:42:27.520]  And you're sitting there drooling
[3:42:27.520 --> 3:42:29.520]  Like a bunch of idiots behind me
[3:42:29.520 --> 3:42:31.520]  They got one cow up
[3:42:31.520 --> 3:42:32.520]  Hanging by its legs in front of you
[3:42:32.520 --> 3:42:34.520]  Blood pouring out its neck and huge pools
[3:42:34.520 --> 3:42:35.520]  And you're just snickering
[3:42:35.520 --> 3:42:38.520]  Telling me that isn't one of our fellow cows
[3:42:38.520 --> 3:42:39.520]  Getting their throat slit
[3:42:39.520 --> 3:42:41.520]  Right in front of us you idiots
[3:42:44.520 --> 3:42:46.520]  Oh God, I can't do it anymore
[3:42:46.520 --> 3:42:48.520]  I can't, I want out of here
[3:42:48.520 --> 3:42:50.520]  I want to go to some happy friendly country
[3:42:50.520 --> 3:42:51.520]  Where this isn't going on
[3:42:51.520 --> 3:42:53.520]  There's evil going on all around you
[3:42:53.520 --> 3:42:55.520]  They're feeding on your neighbors down the street
[3:42:58.520 --> 3:42:59.520]  But you don't know your neighbors anymore
[3:42:59.520 --> 3:43:01.520]  So you're not aware of what's happening
[3:43:05.520 --> 3:43:07.520]  I get so mad reading this article
[3:43:07.520 --> 3:43:09.520]  I just can't control myself
[3:43:09.520 --> 3:43:11.520]  Oh Jesus
[3:43:11.520 --> 3:43:14.520]  Assembly Bill 10942
[3:43:14.520 --> 3:43:16.520]  Introduced, we're only a few years away
[3:43:16.520 --> 3:43:18.520]  From cops coming to your house and SWAT team
[3:43:18.520 --> 3:43:20.520]  And you don't shoot your kids up
[3:43:20.520 --> 3:43:21.520]  And I'm just telling the cops right now
[3:43:21.520 --> 3:43:23.520]  You're pushing and pushing the globalists
[3:43:23.520 --> 3:43:24.520]  No, people are going to fight back
[3:43:24.520 --> 3:43:25.520]  Then they're going to say
[3:43:25.520 --> 3:43:27.520]  See, there is homegrown terrorism
[3:43:27.520 --> 3:43:28.520]  And then you're going to all get your butts kicked
[3:43:28.520 --> 3:43:30.520]  And they're going to bring in foreign trips
[3:43:30.520 --> 3:43:32.520]  You understand you've pushed far enough
[3:43:32.520 --> 3:43:35.520]  You slime ball, think you're tough punks
[3:43:35.520 --> 3:43:38.520]  Assembly Bill 10942
[3:43:38.520 --> 3:43:40.520]  Introduced at the request of Richard Danes
[3:43:40.520 --> 3:43:43.520]  The commissioner of the New York State Department of Health
[3:43:43.520 --> 3:43:44.520]  Calls for changes to the law
[3:43:44.520 --> 3:43:47.520]  In order to make recommended inoculation compulsory
[3:43:47.520 --> 3:43:50.520]  In order for children to attend school
[3:43:50.520 --> 3:43:52.520]  The bill would also permit the administration
[3:43:52.520 --> 3:43:55.520]  Of vaccines for sexually transmitted infections
[3:43:55.520 --> 3:43:57.520]  To minors without parental consent
[3:43:57.520 --> 3:43:58.520]  Now that is huge
[3:43:58.520 --> 3:44:00.520]  They're already taking your kids for abortions
[3:44:00.520 --> 3:44:01.520]  Without your consent
[3:44:01.520 --> 3:44:03.520]  You're 12 or 13 year old
[3:44:03.520 --> 3:44:05.520]  In some cases as young as 10
[3:44:05.520 --> 3:44:07.520]  They're going to have a letter to go to the zoo
[3:44:07.520 --> 3:44:09.520]  With the government training camp
[3:44:09.520 --> 3:44:13.520]  But not to have a baby ripped out of them
[3:44:13.520 --> 3:44:15.520]  Of course they're so lazy
[3:44:15.520 --> 3:44:17.520]  The Planned Parenthoods have the town
[3:44:17.520 --> 3:44:18.520]  They leave an arm or a leg in there
[3:44:18.520 --> 3:44:19.520]  I'm sorry to get the tail
[3:44:19.520 --> 3:44:21.520]  And your daughter dies of some super fever
[3:44:21.520 --> 3:44:22.520]  But you don't care
[3:44:22.520 --> 3:44:24.520]  It's all part of being scum
[3:44:24.520 --> 3:44:27.520]  You let the scum filth degenerate
[3:44:27.520 --> 3:44:30.520]  Viporous, murdering, trash, commie government
[3:44:30.520 --> 3:44:32.520]  Just have its way with your kids
[3:44:32.520 --> 3:44:35.520]  While they train them to tattle on you and everything else
[3:44:35.520 --> 3:44:37.520]  And you've had all your instincts sucked out of you
[3:44:37.520 --> 3:44:40.520]  Where you think a bunch of vampiric scumbag government
[3:44:40.520 --> 3:44:41.520]  Learing over your children
[3:44:41.520 --> 3:44:44.520]  The state, stating in California Supreme Court
[3:44:44.520 --> 3:44:46.520]  The state owns your children
[3:44:46.520 --> 3:44:48.520]  Remember that?
[3:44:48.520 --> 3:44:50.520]  And that homeschooling is illegal in California
[3:44:50.520 --> 3:44:53.520]  You're out of control, the government's dirt bag!
[3:44:59.520 --> 3:45:02.520]  The bill would also permit the administration of vaccines
[3:45:02.520 --> 3:45:04.520]  For sexually transmitted infections to minors
[3:45:04.520 --> 3:45:05.520]  Without parental consent
[3:45:05.520 --> 3:45:07.520]  Merck, when they're not killing you with their Vioxx
[3:45:07.520 --> 3:45:09.520]  They've got their
[3:45:09.520 --> 3:45:12.520]  Gardasil, which admittedly has killed a whole bunch of people
[3:45:12.520 --> 3:45:14.520]  Because it's horrible autoimmune things
[3:45:14.520 --> 3:45:16.520]  Look like a bola with blood pouring out of every orifice
[3:45:16.520 --> 3:45:17.520]  Go read it
[3:45:17.520 --> 3:45:20.520]  Had women on, it's almost killed on the show
[3:45:20.520 --> 3:45:23.520]  And it's been the news that's killed a bunch
[3:45:23.520 --> 3:45:25.520]  And then they say on the insert
[3:45:25.520 --> 3:45:26.520]  Go look it up on their own website
[3:45:26.520 --> 3:45:28.520]  Says, does it protect you from cancer?
[3:45:28.520 --> 3:45:30.520]  Does it protect you from this type of virus?
[3:45:30.520 --> 3:45:32.520]  We think it might protect you from a few strains
[3:45:32.520 --> 3:45:35.520]  Of 350, it might cover four to six
[3:45:35.520 --> 3:45:38.520]  But if you already have the virus
[3:45:38.520 --> 3:45:40.520]  Which around half the population has
[3:45:40.520 --> 3:45:42.520]  Of men and women
[3:45:42.520 --> 3:45:44.520]  Then it gives you a 45% increase in cancer
[3:45:44.520 --> 3:45:46.520]  Oh, they know it gives you cancer
[3:45:46.520 --> 3:45:48.520]  But you're too stupid
[3:45:48.520 --> 3:45:50.520]  You think the government gives you sweet milk
[3:45:50.520 --> 3:45:53.520]  And you sit there suckling off of its snake breast
[3:45:53.520 --> 3:45:57.520]  When you don't understand, it's pure death!
[3:45:59.520 --> 3:46:02.520]  I have to watch my fellow humans
[3:46:02.520 --> 3:46:05.520]  March into the death camps in front of me
[3:46:05.520 --> 3:46:08.520]  But it's all done
[3:46:08.520 --> 3:46:11.520]  In an orderly fashion of ignorance and moronicness
[3:46:11.520 --> 3:46:13.520]  Do you hear all the scientists and guests
[3:46:13.520 --> 3:46:15.520]  And new old order people I have on, who I tear apart?
[3:46:15.520 --> 3:46:17.520]  And it's not because I'm smart
[3:46:17.520 --> 3:46:19.520]  I understand the system, I study it
[3:46:19.520 --> 3:46:21.520]  It's what I do, I know what I'm talking about
[3:46:21.520 --> 3:46:23.520]  I've told you the truth
[3:46:23.520 --> 3:46:26.520]  And nothing but the truth!
[3:46:28.520 --> 3:46:32.520]  In fact, many times it is far worse than even I thought
[3:46:34.520 --> 3:46:36.520]  God almighty
[3:46:36.520 --> 3:46:38.520]  And this is why I want to reach people
[3:46:38.520 --> 3:46:40.520]  This is why I want to get out to more people
[3:46:40.520 --> 3:46:42.520]  This is why I want to bust my butt
[3:46:42.520 --> 3:46:44.520]  And build a studio and do it myself
[3:46:44.520 --> 3:46:46.520]  And tape a TV show
[3:46:46.520 --> 3:46:48.520]  And try to get it on five nights a week on Dish Network
[3:46:48.520 --> 3:46:50.520]  Because then we can hype it and get big listenership
[3:46:50.520 --> 3:46:52.520]  And have street teams out, getting the word out
[3:46:52.520 --> 3:46:55.520]  My God, if it was all paid for, I'd have no commercials on it
[3:46:55.520 --> 3:46:57.520]  As it is, it'll probably have commercials
[3:46:57.520 --> 3:46:59.520]  I need your help, man
[3:46:59.520 --> 3:47:01.520]  I just want to warn people, listen
[3:47:01.520 --> 3:47:03.520]  You go warn people about how this stuff's killing them
[3:47:03.520 --> 3:47:05.520]  You write articles, you go out and tell them
[3:47:05.520 --> 3:47:08.520]  I just want to tell people, I just want to reach people
[3:47:10.520 --> 3:47:14.520]  Because it's going to get worse and worse and worse and worse
[3:47:14.520 --> 3:47:16.520]  And worse and worse and worse
[3:47:16.520 --> 3:47:18.520]  It isn't going to stop
[3:47:18.520 --> 3:47:21.520]  I keep making the point, they do everything they said they were
[3:47:25.520 --> 3:47:28.520]  They do everything they said they were going to do
[3:47:29.520 --> 3:47:31.520]  Write down the line
[3:47:31.520 --> 3:47:33.520]  They say they're going to do this, they do it
[3:47:33.520 --> 3:47:36.520]  And they've said, I've seen their whole battle plan
[3:47:36.520 --> 3:47:38.520]  They admit what they're going to do
[3:47:38.520 --> 3:47:41.520]  And up here, it's killing 80-90% of us
[3:47:41.520 --> 3:47:44.520]  Flying over, spraying us in the end, killing us in mass
[3:47:44.520 --> 3:47:47.520]  Activating cancer systems they've put in us
[3:47:47.520 --> 3:47:49.520]  And they're already up to here
[3:47:49.520 --> 3:47:51.520]  And I'm like, my God, they keep doing everything they say they're going to do
[3:47:51.520 --> 3:47:53.520]  My God, they're really going to do it, my God
[3:47:53.520 --> 3:47:55.520]  My God, warn people
[3:48:00.520 --> 3:48:02.520]  And they're evil, they're so evil
[3:48:02.520 --> 3:48:05.520]  And I just wish good people would wake up and fight back against this
[3:48:09.520 --> 3:48:11.520]  I was screaming so loud earlier, I tore something up my throat
[3:48:11.520 --> 3:48:13.520]  I was coughing up blood earlier
[3:48:14.520 --> 3:48:16.520]  It's because my soul is torn apart
[3:48:16.520 --> 3:48:19.520]  I am just so angry, I don't have the strength or the will
[3:48:19.520 --> 3:48:22.520]  I'm trying to push a rock up a hill, I need your help
[3:48:22.520 --> 3:48:26.520]  I just want to warn people, I just want to arrest all these people that have done this
[3:48:26.520 --> 3:48:29.520]  It's their own documents, their own treason
[3:48:29.520 --> 3:48:33.520]  They all write books about how they're going to enslave us and how it's funny and how we're dumb
[3:48:33.520 --> 3:48:37.520]  And then you just sit there laughing at me while they're laughing at you
[3:48:42.520 --> 3:48:43.520]  I want to get them
[3:48:46.520 --> 3:48:48.520]  I want to get people that want to get me
[3:48:51.520 --> 3:48:54.520]  I don't go around looking for fights, but I sure as heck
[3:48:54.520 --> 3:48:57.520]  Will stand up against somebody that starts one with me
[3:48:57.520 --> 3:49:00.520]  And I've tried to get away from it, I've tried to run away
[3:49:00.520 --> 3:49:02.520]  I've tried to tell myself it's going to be alright
[3:49:02.520 --> 3:49:06.520]  I've tried to tell myself we're going to win and it's going to be okay, but not unless we put out a full effort
[3:49:07.520 --> 3:49:10.520]  I've tried to avoid this, I've tried to deny this
[3:49:10.520 --> 3:49:13.520]  This is something you can't run away from this
[3:49:13.520 --> 3:49:16.520]  You don't have a choice, they're not going to stop coming
[3:49:16.520 --> 3:49:19.520]  They're not going to stop pushing, they're organized, they're focused
[3:49:19.520 --> 3:49:22.520]  They're coming to kill you
[3:49:22.520 --> 3:49:25.520]  From the bottom of my heart, go research the facts
[3:49:25.520 --> 3:49:27.520]  Research it all
[3:49:29.520 --> 3:49:33.520]  The bill would also permit the administration of vaccines for sexually transmitted infections
[3:49:36.520 --> 3:49:38.520]  To minors without parental consent
[3:49:38.520 --> 3:49:40.520]  God, that's the state becoming the parents
[3:49:40.520 --> 3:49:43.520]  Separate sections, the bill would also come into effect next year
[3:49:43.520 --> 3:49:46.520]  With others becoming law in 2010
[3:49:46.520 --> 3:49:48.520]  So there you have it, no more
[3:49:48.520 --> 3:49:50.520]  Do you control your children or do they control it?
[3:49:50.520 --> 3:49:55.520]  The state under the new eugenics social system controls you
[3:49:55.520 --> 3:49:58.520]  AidChamp, a national nonpartisan political action organization
[3:49:58.520 --> 3:50:04.520]  Formed by parents to support children with neurodevelopmental and communication disorders
[3:50:04.520 --> 3:50:08.520]  Has called for rejection of the bill and is demanding the passage of
[3:50:08.520 --> 3:50:13.520]  A5468-S3031 in the Senate
[3:50:13.520 --> 3:50:17.520]  A bill that would give individuals a right to a philosophical exemption
[3:50:17.520 --> 3:50:20.520]  They don't have to give us, see, that we already have the right
[3:50:20.520 --> 3:50:22.520]  They're now claiming we don't have that right
[3:50:22.520 --> 3:50:25.520]  The group's press release highlights the key points of the bill
[3:50:25.520 --> 3:50:28.520]  My God
[3:50:28.520 --> 3:50:33.520]  All children at birth will be injected if you don't like it, a SWAT team will murder you
[3:50:33.520 --> 3:50:35.520]  Yeah, you resist, they'll come kill you
[3:50:35.520 --> 3:50:38.520]  All children, it's hell on earth, it's war against us
[3:50:38.520 --> 3:50:41.520]  Eugenicists coming with their HIV filled injectors
[3:50:41.520 --> 3:50:44.520]  With their cancer filled injectors, with their mercury filled
[3:50:44.520 --> 3:50:47.520]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap or detergent?
[3:50:47.520 --> 3:50:52.520]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes and more
[3:50:52.520 --> 3:50:56.520]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients
[3:50:56.520 --> 3:50:58.520]  Most of which are synthetic
[3:50:58.520 --> 3:51:00.520]  Hi, this is Alex Jones
[3:51:00.520 --> 3:51:03.520]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives
[3:51:03.520 --> 3:51:09.520]  That can lead to coughing, wheezing and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin and mucous membranes

[3:51:52.520 --> 3:51:57.520]  An entirely new two hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever
[3:51:57.520 --> 3:52:01.520]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation
[3:52:01.520 --> 3:52:04.520]  In which family members receive answers to their questions
[3:52:04.520 --> 3:52:08.520]  And the true perpetrators of the horrendous crime are brought to justice
[3:52:08.520 --> 3:52:11.520]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose
[3:52:11.520 --> 3:52:15.520]  From hijackers being trained at US military bases to bombs in the buildings
[3:52:15.520 --> 3:52:19.520]  Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see
[3:52:19.520 --> 3:52:24.520]  Secure your copy of Loose Change Final Cut today at infowars.com or prisonplanet.com
[3:52:24.520 --> 3:52:28.520]  While you're visiting the online video store, be sure to check out the huge discounts
[3:52:28.520 --> 3:52:35.520]  On films like Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, America, Freedom to Fascism and hundreds of other titles
[3:52:35.520 --> 3:52:37.520]  We're in a no holds bar information war
[3:52:37.520 --> 3:52:43.520]  Truth is our weapon and prisonplanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother
[3:52:43.520 --> 3:52:45.520]  My cracked heels were always my nemesis
[3:52:45.520 --> 3:52:50.520]  All my life I've had dry heels and rough thickened skin on the soles and sides of my feet
[3:52:50.520 --> 3:52:53.520]  Then my podiatrist told me about Calix Ointment
[3:52:53.520 --> 3:52:57.520]  I am amazed how fast and efficient this product is at softening the hard spots
[3:52:57.520 --> 3:53:03.520]  Since using Calix, the split and cracked skin on my heels is gone, leaving them smooth and healthy looking
[3:53:03.520 --> 3:53:06.520]  I'm so grateful and no longer embarrassed in sandals
[3:53:06.520 --> 3:53:09.520]  If you have dry cracked feet, I recommend Calix Ointment
[3:53:09.520 --> 3:53:30.520]  You'll find it in the foot care section at drugstores, mass retailers and super centers
[3:54:00.520 --> 3:54:07.520]  There's only maybe 2% of the population that knows they're poisoning the water and food and vaccines by design
[3:54:07.520 --> 3:54:12.520]  They're counting on you to be too cowardly to admit the truth
[3:54:12.520 --> 3:54:15.520]  Because it's scary to admit it and find it out
[3:54:15.520 --> 3:54:20.520]  So not just let me be some nut on the radio, but to go look at the claims I've made
[3:54:20.520 --> 3:54:23.520]  Find out they're killing you
[3:54:23.520 --> 3:54:26.520]  Because then you're going to have a job to do
[3:54:26.520 --> 3:54:30.520]  You're going to have to fight back against these people
[3:54:30.520 --> 3:54:34.520]  Make no mistake, those of you that have committed the genocide
[3:54:34.520 --> 3:54:40.520]  Those of you that got 40 million dead Africans on your hands
[3:54:40.520 --> 3:54:44.520]  You're going to pay one day
[3:54:44.520 --> 3:54:47.520]  You're going to swim from the end of a rope
[3:54:47.520 --> 3:54:50.520]  You know why?
[3:54:50.520 --> 3:54:55.520]  Because you keep pushing and you never stop
[3:54:55.520 --> 3:55:00.520]  And you're going to push us up against a wall where a lot of these cowardly dumbed down people
[3:55:00.520 --> 3:55:04.520]  Aren't going to have any opportunity but to fight back
[3:55:04.520 --> 3:55:07.520]  We're going to kick your butt
[3:55:07.520 --> 3:55:11.520]  A lot of us are going to die in the process
[3:55:11.520 --> 3:55:13.520]  But in the end you're going down, know that
[3:55:13.520 --> 3:55:19.520]  And your family names and dynasties will be synonymous with evil in the dictionary
[3:55:19.520 --> 3:55:21.520]  I'm out of time, I want to thank all you the listeners
[3:55:21.520 --> 3:55:32.520]  This retransmission starts in a few minutes at infowars.com
[3:55:32.520 --> 3:55:36.520]  15,000 plus and growing has come into the paypal
[3:55:36.520 --> 3:55:41.520]  Since today, this is not the money bomb day, but people are already giving
[3:55:41.520 --> 3:55:44.520]  And so it looks like it's going to be huge
[3:55:44.520 --> 3:55:47.520]  And we will put it all into the fight against the New World Order
[3:55:47.520 --> 3:55:51.520]  It will be a toll free number up this evening for you as well starting at midnight
[3:55:51.520 --> 3:55:53.520]  It will be up there earlier than that
[3:55:53.520 --> 3:55:55.520]  Is the toll free number up yet?
[3:55:55.520 --> 3:55:57.520]  We need to get that up because I need to go ahead and get that
[3:55:57.520 --> 3:56:00.520]  People know what it is in case some people won't have internet access later
[3:56:00.520 --> 3:56:03.520]  Or some people need to give this to others that don't have internet access
[3:56:03.520 --> 3:56:06.520]  What is the 1,800 number? Maybe I'll just give it out to people
[3:56:06.520 --> 3:56:08.520]  A lot of my listeners, I forgot about that also
[3:56:08.520 --> 3:56:11.520]  It's 888-201-2244
[3:56:11.520 --> 3:56:15.520]  888-201-2244
[3:56:15.520 --> 3:56:19.520]  That's 888-201-2244
[3:56:19.520 --> 3:56:21.520]  That's not open right now, but it will be at midnight tonight
[3:56:21.520 --> 3:56:24.520]  Central 888-201-2244

[3:56:27.520 --> 3:56:29.520]  And they may not have a way to do it
[3:56:29.520 --> 3:56:32.520]  But we can't just rely on these money bombs
[3:56:32.520 --> 3:56:35.520]  We also have sponsors and in closing, I haven't plugged these today
[3:56:35.520 --> 3:56:37.520]  Inner food and Aloe's
[3:56:37.520 --> 3:56:40.520]  Inner food is the best green food out there that I have found
[3:56:40.520 --> 3:56:42.520]  Bar none anywhere
[3:56:42.520 --> 3:56:45.520]  And we're not like the government telling you you've got to take shots filled with poison
[3:56:45.520 --> 3:56:47.520]  We're just saying, hey, here's some good green food, we think it's great
[3:56:47.520 --> 3:56:49.520]  To combat all this poison
[3:56:49.520 --> 3:56:53.520]  And their number is 866-762-9238
