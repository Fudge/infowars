[00:00:00.249 --> 00:00:01.990]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:03.590]  You want answers?
[00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:05.131]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:05.131 --> 00:00:09.332]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:09.332 --> 00:00:13.374]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:33.038 --> 00:00:35.779]  We've got a really big broadcast lined up for you today.
[00:00:35.779 --> 00:00:40.402]  I'll tell you about some of the guests that are coming up in a few minutes.
[00:00:40.402 --> 00:00:47.285]  In the meantime, I do want to let you know that I am going to Virginia next Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and coming back on Sunday.
[00:00:47.285 --> 00:00:50.226]  We'll be in Chantilly, right outside the District of Criminals.
[00:00:50.226 --> 00:00:58.410]  We'll be covering Bilderberg 2008 for you there, and we hope to see everybody out there as well.
[00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.671]  We'll be posting over the weekend.
[00:01:00.431 --> 00:01:19.109]  I mean, that's already up there in some stories we've written in the last two weeks, but we'll give everybody the exact details and where we're going to be at so that you can come out, demonstrate, engage in the First Amendment as free citizen press, whatever you'd like to cover the global elite coming into the United States and setting policy.
[00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:26.722]  First thing I want to do right now is air this little three-minute CNN piece where they attempt to whitewash.
[00:01:26.722 --> 00:01:30.324]  They don't deny that the United States government created HIV.
[00:01:30.324 --> 00:01:35.867]  And when I say United States government, the criminal government that sits atop our government and controls it.
[00:01:35.867 --> 00:01:41.811]  The parasite that sits in our central nervous system, controlling the levers.
[00:01:41.811 --> 00:01:47.414]  They just try to mix it in with some other issues that they claim can't be completely proven.
[00:01:48.007 --> 00:02:00.073]  And the fact that they can't deny it is because there is so much evidence, so many admissions, so many Nobel Prize winners and top scientists and documents, that when you look at it, it is horrifying.
[00:02:00.073 --> 00:02:14.760]  The question is, do you have the courage to admit psychopathic murderers, genius scientists, run the planet for a handful of banking families and are waging biological warfare, chemical warfare on all of us right now?
[00:02:16.312 --> 00:02:27.039]  Then, acting cool and primping or, you know, going to church for social reasons or, you know, all these little political things we do don't matter as much anymore, do they?
[00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:35.944]  Your precious local baseball team doesn't matter as much when you realize that we have psychopaths running our lives and it needs to change because things are about to get even worse.
[00:02:35.944 --> 00:02:36.885]  Let's go ahead and go to that clip.
[00:02:37.287 --> 00:02:41.113]  Reverend Jeremiah Wright has his theories and he's sticking to them.
[00:02:41.113 --> 00:02:43.135]  Take this assertion from a few years ago.
[00:02:43.135 --> 00:02:50.886]  The government lied about inventing the HIV virus as a means of genocide against people of color.
[00:02:50.886 --> 00:02:51.828]  Government's lie!
[00:02:52.777 --> 00:03:00.500]  Now, under the glare that's gotten Barack Obama into such a deep political dilemma, Reverend Wright is asked, do you really believe that?
[00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.642]  Have you read Horowitz's book, Emerging Viruses, AIDS and Ebola?
[00:03:04.642 --> 00:03:14.426]  In the 1996 book, Emerging Viruses, Dr. Leonard Horowitz wrote that HIV was introduced to gay men in New York and blacks in Central Africa by a U.S.
[00:03:14.426 --> 00:03:21.849]  government-sponsored hepatitis B vaccine, a program of genocide, Horowitz claims, designed to reduce the world's population.
[00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:25.973]  The author is grateful for Reverend Wright's acknowledgment.
[00:03:25.973 --> 00:03:40.269]  He's simply doing a godly service and a public service by pointing out the truth that has been heavily suppressed by government officials as well as, unfortunately, the mainstream media.
[00:03:40.831 --> 00:03:47.257]  Horowitz claims the Centers for Disease Control came up with one of the strains of the vaccine and then helped cover the scheme up.
[00:03:47.257 --> 00:03:56.726]  Contacted by CNN, a CDC official points to government-sponsored research that identifies a subspecies of chimpanzees in Western Africa as the original source of HIV.
[00:03:57.907 --> 00:04:01.129]  This is a widely held theory among medical researchers.
[00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:05.111]  But Reverend Wright cites another book that has more historical support.
[00:04:05.111 --> 00:04:06.832]  Have you read Medical Apartheid?
[00:04:06.832 --> 00:04:14.276]  Based on this Tuskegee experiment, and based on what has happened to Africans in this country, I believe our government is capable of doing anything.
[00:04:14.276 --> 00:04:20.899]  The Tuskegee experiment was a government-sponsored program started in the 1930s to examine the spread of syphilis.
[00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:24.601]  Men who already had it were not told, and a cure was withheld from them.
[00:04:25.041 --> 00:04:28.983]  President Bill Clinton apologized for the program in 1997.
[00:04:28.983 --> 00:04:35.866]  Reverend Wright also supports a theory from one researcher on how white and African-American children have different ways of learning and thinking.
[00:04:35.866 --> 00:04:37.827]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[00:04:37.827 --> 00:04:48.212]  So then they mix in some educational theory or brain theory in different groups of homo sapien sapien that has nothing to do with it.
[00:04:48.212 --> 00:04:49.253]  It's just disgusting.
[00:04:49.253 --> 00:04:51.034]  You're a pack of murdering scum!
[00:04:52.995 --> 00:04:58.980]  Attention GCN listeners, would you like to watch uncensored, unregulated, even banned TV on your computer?
[00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:10.451]  Well now you can watch satellite TV on your PC with an extremely simple hookup that allows computer owners to pick up more channels than any sane person can even watch without paying monthly cable or satellite fees.
[00:05:10.851 --> 00:05:12.012]  Here's the story.
[00:05:12.012 --> 00:05:20.159]  New video feed technology lets anyone with a high-speed internet connection gain instant access to an endless list of underground channels from all over the globe.
[00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:21.320]  And here's the best part.

[00:05:57.615 --> 00:05:59.777]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:05:59.777 --> 00:06:01.678]  The true story of the Bilderberg Group.
[00:06:01.678 --> 00:06:03.159]  The late great USA.
[00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:04.941]  America, freedom to fascism.
[00:06:04.941 --> 00:06:11.967]  These are just a few of the hundreds of powerful documentary films and books available at truthnews.us and prisonplanet.com.

[00:06:52.742 --> 00:06:56.523]  Hi, this is Alex Jones, and I want to talk to you about the high price of gasoline.
[00:06:56.523 --> 00:07:01.224]  It's no secret that gasoline quality is poor, even though we're paying record prices at the pump.
[00:07:01.224 --> 00:07:06.525]  I have run across a company called SFR, who has developed two products that improve gas mileage.
[00:07:06.525 --> 00:07:17.748]  Instead of paying a mechanic as much as $300 to clean your injection system, Protecta Complete Fuel System Treatment cleans to 95% of new engine condition, improving mileage in only one tank full.
[00:07:17.748 --> 00:07:20.109]  Protecta Engine Treatment not only reduces friction,
[00:07:20.529 --> 00:07:22.549]  But it extends the life of your engine.
[00:07:22.549 --> 00:07:23.470]  Let's face it.
[00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:26.310]  With the high price of gasoline, it's time to take action.
[00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:34.312]  Purchase a protective fuel system treatment for only $9.95 and receive a free engine treatment which is a $12.95 value free.
[00:07:34.312 --> 00:07:36.612]  Call 888-USE-SFR1.
[00:07:36.612 --> 00:07:40.233]  That number again is 888-USE-SFR1.
[00:07:40.233 --> 00:07:43.794]  Or check them out online at oilcompanysecret.com.
[00:07:43.794 --> 00:07:45.974]  That's oilcompanysecret.com.

[00:07:48.835 --> 00:07:50.458]  And it's safe for all cars.
[00:07:50.458 --> 00:07:53.183]  Act now.
[00:07:53.183 --> 00:07:55.948]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:07:55.948 --> 00:07:58.752]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:01.383 --> 00:08:05.366]  But Reverend Wright cites another book that has more historical support.
[00:08:05.366 --> 00:08:07.087]  Have you read Medical Apartheid?
[00:08:07.087 --> 00:08:14.532]  Based on the Tuskegee experiment, and based on what has happened to Africans in this country, I believe our government is capable of doing anything.
[00:08:14.532 --> 00:08:21.137]  The Tuskegee experiment was a government-sponsored program started in the 1930s to examine the spread of syphilis.
[00:08:21.137 --> 00:08:24.860]  Men who already had it were not told, and a cure was withheld from them.
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:29.221]  President Bill Clinton apologized for the program in 1997.
[00:08:29.221 --> 00:08:36.823]  Reverend Wright also supports a theory from one researcher on how white and African American children have different ways of learning and thinking.
[00:08:36.823 --> 00:08:42.785]  The theory that kids with European origins have a left brain cog from which they learn by observing objects.
[00:08:42.785 --> 00:08:48.607]  And that African American children are right brain oriented, learning creatively and intuitively from people.
[00:08:49.147 --> 00:08:55.492]  We spoke with a prominent child psychiatrist and a noted education expert about that left-brain, right-brain theory.
[00:08:55.492 --> 00:08:58.394]  Both said it is not a very widely held view.
[00:08:58.394 --> 00:09:00.915]  Brian Todd, CNN, Washington.
[00:09:00.915 --> 00:09:04.498]  Okay, so if you tuned in to the first segment, we played the first part of that CNN piece.
[00:09:04.498 --> 00:09:12.704]  They don't deny that Reverend Wright is right about government bioweapons being used on different groups of people.
[00:09:14.033 --> 00:09:27.678]  But then at the end of it, they just come out with some other issue that they claim Reverend Knight talks about, about different physiological differences between African brains and European brains.
[00:09:27.678 --> 00:09:37.521]  Which I'm not getting into a debate about, but if you really want to get into just the CAT scans, there is different CC size, different on average.
[00:09:38.291 --> 00:09:44.292]  You can always find one black brain versus one white brain or one Asian brain and one white brain that are pretty much physiologically the same.
[00:09:44.292 --> 00:09:53.534]  But overall, there are characteristic differences in the very physiology of different groups of Homo sapiens sapien.
[00:09:53.534 --> 00:10:04.857]  But regardless, they just throw that into there and then say, oh, we talked to a noted specialist and don't say who, and they said that's not a popular theory.
[00:10:05.669 --> 00:10:16.793]  You see, they just mix that in when it has nothing to do with Reverend Wright saying that AIDS, HIV, was engineered as a bioweapon.
[00:10:16.793 --> 00:10:29.277]  And they show one book in there, which is all the documents and admissions of South Africa, Israel, and others developing race-specific bioweapons to wipe out certain races of Homo sapiens sapiens.
[00:10:30.928 --> 00:10:38.414]  And if there weren't differences, ladies and gentlemen, they couldn't tailor race-specific genotype weapons.
[00:10:38.414 --> 00:10:41.677]  By the way, where do we get these conspiracy theories?
[00:10:41.677 --> 00:10:55.469]  Published by Dick Cheney, Rebuilding America's Defenses, September 20th, 2001, PNAC public plan for the Congress and the White House, delivered to every member of the House and Senate and to the executive.
[00:10:57.702 --> 00:11:03.684]  Where Dick Cheney says we need to legitimize the use of race-specific bioweapons.
[00:11:03.684 --> 00:11:12.666]  For heaven's sakes, don't believe me, you lazy police, you lazy FBI listening, you lazy little BATF.
[00:11:12.666 --> 00:11:21.749]  You understand this isn't about your shaved heads and your devil tattoos and your Corvette and, you know, acting cool out on your boat on the weekend and being a big tough cop.
[00:11:22.287 --> 00:11:28.270]  You understand this isn't about you being a guy worth a hundred million dollars that owns car dealerships in New York or Texas.
[00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:35.695]  This isn't about you being on the, you know, most elite, whites-only country club in California.
[00:11:35.695 --> 00:11:43.219]  This isn't about you being a black leader, you know, with your local socialist church who sits around talking bad about whitey all day.
[00:11:43.219 --> 00:11:45.881]  This is life and death.
[00:11:45.881 --> 00:11:48.122]  Do you understand?
[00:11:48.917 --> 00:11:54.679]  Do you understand that 30 plus years ago, they had declassified race weapons?
[00:11:54.679 --> 00:12:12.687]  You understand they got level 4, and yes, even above that, underground level 5 laboratories all over the world, and they want to put a control grid in, in the name of fighting Al-Qaeda, and if you look at its whole attack pattern, its setup, and their admissions, it is built to suppress millions of individual citizens.
[00:12:13.507 --> 00:12:18.173]  And all they want is a straitjacket so they can then release this stuff on us.
[00:12:18.173 --> 00:12:20.677]  You understand me, FBI?
[00:12:20.677 --> 00:12:22.980]  You understand me, police?
[00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:26.084]  You understand they're gonna kill you too?
[00:12:26.084 --> 00:12:28.648]  You understand that if they have their way, you're dead?
[00:12:29.188 --> 00:12:30.208]  YOU'RE DEAD!
[00:12:30.208 --> 00:12:30.908]  IT'S OVER!
[00:12:30.908 --> 00:12:32.209]  YOU UNDERSTAND?!
[00:12:32.209 --> 00:12:34.289]  YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT IT'S LIKE TO KNOW THIS EACH DAY?!
[00:12:34.289 --> 00:12:40.811]  AND SEE A BUNCH OF SMART-ASS MAINLINE PEOPLE MAKING JOKES AND LAUGHING AND ALL THE STUFF THAT'S GOING ON?!
[00:12:40.811 --> 00:12:41.931]  THIS IS THE REAL WORLD!
[00:12:41.931 --> 00:12:43.411]  THIS ISN'T A JOKE OR A GAME!
[00:12:43.411 --> 00:12:47.512]  Oh, God.
[00:12:47.512 --> 00:12:48.852]  Oh, God.
[00:12:48.852 --> 00:12:56.334]  I can't believe this has to happen before you're gonna listen.
[00:12:56.334 --> 00:12:56.714]  Oh, God.
[00:12:58.396 --> 00:13:03.398]  What is even the point of doing this radio show?
[00:13:03.398 --> 00:13:17.425]  I told you seven, eight years ago, as time flies, it was back in 2000, I learned, I finally started reading Club of Rome documents, CFR, United Nations Biological Diversity Assessment documents, I put them in Road to Tyranny.
[00:13:17.425 --> 00:13:21.487]  A year later?
[00:13:21.487 --> 00:13:26.629]  Where you go read official UN policy, voted on by the General Assembly.
[00:13:28.627 --> 00:13:28.927]  That's right.
[00:13:28.927 --> 00:13:32.992]  Voted on by 170 plus countries.
[00:13:32.992 --> 00:13:36.096]  And what does it say?
[00:13:36.096 --> 00:13:42.823]  It says that they're going to have a world carbon tax and a card you swipe.
[00:13:42.823 --> 00:13:45.907]  And everything you do is going to be on that card for surveillance and control.
[00:13:45.907 --> 00:13:47.008]  That's one facet of it.
[00:13:47.952 --> 00:13:50.593]  That they're going to tax and regulate every facet of your life.
[00:13:50.593 --> 00:13:55.014]  You're going to have inspectors in your home first every year, then every month, then every week.
[00:13:55.014 --> 00:13:56.815]  Then you're going to have block captains.
[00:13:56.815 --> 00:13:58.215]  Everything's going to be regulated.
[00:13:58.215 --> 00:13:59.836]  Total brainwashing.
[00:13:59.836 --> 00:14:02.457]  They're going to take the young people and put them in gray uniforms.
[00:14:02.457 --> 00:14:04.457]  They even said what the uniforms are going to look like.
[00:14:04.457 --> 00:14:10.119]  And when you see the gray uniforms, I want you to remember, they do everything they say they're going to do.
[00:14:11.363 --> 00:14:12.504]  That's why I'm so freaked out.
[00:14:12.504 --> 00:14:13.764]  I keep wishing they'd slow down.
[00:14:13.764 --> 00:14:15.125]  I keep wishing I was wrong.
[00:14:15.125 --> 00:14:18.607]  I keep wishing that it was only battle plans and they weren't carrying them out.
[00:14:18.607 --> 00:14:19.188]  Let me tell you something.
[00:14:19.188 --> 00:14:20.308]  They're making a list.
[00:14:20.308 --> 00:14:21.189]  They're checking it twice.
[00:14:21.189 --> 00:14:22.189]  They're going right down it.
[00:14:22.189 --> 00:14:23.530]  They're doing it all.
[00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:25.551]  And we're following every step.
[00:14:25.551 --> 00:14:30.194]  Every step on this chart as we go right into hell.
[00:14:30.194 --> 00:14:32.355]  And now they're announcing it.
[00:14:32.355 --> 00:14:36.918]  In the U.S., in San Francisco, in New York, and many other cities where they can implement first.
[00:14:36.918 --> 00:14:38.239]  And all over Canada.
[00:14:38.239 --> 00:14:38.819]  And in England.
[00:14:39.657 --> 00:14:47.338]  I told you they'd have tracker chips that scanned everything in your trash can, that blocked Captain Environmental Police would inspect your trash at night.
[00:14:47.338 --> 00:14:50.699]  From Australia to England to San Francisco, it's now begun.
[00:14:50.699 --> 00:15:02.761]  They come to your door, quasi-governmental, semi-deputized, they sick police on you, local control freak volunteers, and they say someone in this household must sign this pledge.
[00:15:02.761 --> 00:15:04.941]  There's no law, but they tell you it's the law and threaten you.
[00:15:04.941 --> 00:15:05.922]  This is in the news now.
[00:15:05.922 --> 00:15:06.902]  Happening now.
[00:15:06.902 --> 00:15:08.082]  From England to the U.S.
[00:15:09.449 --> 00:15:14.693]  City by city under UN and George Soros funding.
[00:15:14.693 --> 00:15:18.395]  And the Republicans are all with it as well.
[00:15:18.395 --> 00:15:21.357]  I told you Bush was going to endorse Kyoto and he did.
[00:15:21.357 --> 00:15:23.179]  Told you that six years ago, he did it.
[00:15:23.179 --> 00:15:29.003]  We told you a week before he announced it because Bilderberg ordered him to.
[00:15:29.003 --> 00:15:30.904]  Now he announced one week after we told you.
[00:15:30.904 --> 00:15:36.888]  We tell you before the Berlin Wall falls that it was going to happen.
[00:15:37.367 --> 00:15:37.967]  A year before.
[00:15:37.967 --> 00:15:46.753]  We tell you that the attack on Iraq wasn't in 2002 in March, it would be the next year in 03 in March, and it happened exactly to the day.
[00:15:46.753 --> 00:15:47.513]  You know why?
[00:15:47.513 --> 00:15:53.076]  Because we go and we spy on them to incredible danger to ourselves and our families.
[00:15:53.076 --> 00:15:56.938]  You lazy people who don't appreciate anything!
[00:15:56.938 --> 00:15:58.659]  They're coming for you!
[00:15:58.659 --> 00:16:01.821]  They're already attacking you through the water and the air!
[00:16:01.821 --> 00:16:04.823]  I couldn't sleep last night!
[00:16:05.649 --> 00:16:19.607]  I've never felt such on edge.
[00:16:19.607 --> 00:16:23.793]  They're going to regulate every facet of your life under this.
[00:16:26.317 --> 00:16:32.319]  They make you sign a contract under threat, just like they make you take shots when there's no law to take them, but millions take it every year.
[00:16:32.319 --> 00:16:38.680]  1,400, 1,500 kids with their families lined up last year, just a few months ago.
[00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:40.481]  We had the state attorney on.
[00:16:40.481 --> 00:16:43.401]  They were on the news saying, it's the law, you'll be arrested if you don't take the vaccines.
[00:16:43.401 --> 00:16:43.781]  I had him on.
[00:16:43.781 --> 00:16:45.342]  He said, yeah, it's not a law.
[00:16:45.342 --> 00:16:48.003]  Then I had them on the news saying it was the law.
[00:16:48.003 --> 00:16:49.803]  And then he admitted he had vaccinated his own kids.
[00:16:53.376 --> 00:16:54.377]  Remember I had him on?
[00:16:54.377 --> 00:16:57.819]  And there was the newscast, the video, of thousands of people.
[00:16:57.819 --> 00:16:59.640]  1,500 kids, a bunch of parents.
[00:16:59.640 --> 00:16:59.900]  Said 1,450.
[00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:01.661]  One newscast said 1,400.
[00:17:01.661 --> 00:17:01.922]  One said 1,500.
[00:17:01.922 --> 00:17:03.142]  That's why I get both numbers.
[00:17:03.142 --> 00:17:04.143]  I don't know.
[00:17:04.143 --> 00:17:04.903]  A bunch of parents.
[00:17:04.903 --> 00:17:06.645]  Over a thousand people.
[00:17:06.645 --> 00:17:07.725]  Children.
[00:17:07.725 --> 00:17:12.488]  And they were there with police dogs barking, police in riot gear.
[00:17:12.488 --> 00:17:16.611]  Being herded into a courthouse to be injected.
[00:17:16.611 --> 00:17:17.892]  Believing it was the law.
[00:17:17.892 --> 00:17:19.973]  That is the darkest tyranny.
[00:17:19.973 --> 00:17:21.234]  It's already here.
[00:17:24.850 --> 00:17:26.472]  It's already amongst us.
[00:17:26.472 --> 00:17:32.660]  We're already deep, deep, deep into tyranny.
[00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:38.607]  Those same police officers, they're compartmentalized.
[00:17:38.607 --> 00:17:42.993]  They're giving their own children the shots.
[00:17:44.935 --> 00:17:51.700]  You see, they believe the football and the baseball and the basketball and the facade and the movies and the fake brotherhood they're in.
[00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:52.701]  They believe the system.
[00:17:52.701 --> 00:17:54.042]  They think the system's good.
[00:17:54.042 --> 00:17:55.904]  They think they're out fighting evil.
[00:17:55.904 --> 00:18:00.327]  They think that, uh, you know, the system's wonderful and everything's fine.
[00:18:00.327 --> 00:18:10.836]  And, you know, I wish I could believe the world was fine and that, uh, the good guys ran the government and that everything was great.
[00:18:10.836 --> 00:18:12.417]  There's a lot of things I want to do in my life.
[00:18:13.922 --> 00:18:15.042]  A lot of things I want to explore.
[00:18:15.042 --> 00:18:20.565]  A lot of places I want to go and see.
[00:18:20.565 --> 00:18:23.566]  But you know something?
[00:18:23.566 --> 00:18:25.026]  I've decided to face reality.
[00:18:25.026 --> 00:18:29.588]  I've decided to really look at what the architects of this world are saying and doing.
[00:18:29.588 --> 00:18:33.190]  And they're saying they're going to kill almost all of us listening right now.
[00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:34.390]  And let me tell you something.
[00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:36.791]  These people do what they say.
[00:18:39.835 --> 00:18:47.159]  I told you before 9-11 they were going to stage massive terror attacks, probably on the World Trade Center, probably blaming their asset Bin Laden.
[00:18:47.159 --> 00:18:59.867]  I told you they would have successive attacks, bring in a world tax, a world army, under the guise of environmentalism, the left side of the Pencer attack.
[00:18:59.867 --> 00:19:02.108]  The CFR has said it's fake.
[00:19:02.108 --> 00:19:03.849]  The terror is fake.
[00:19:03.849 --> 00:19:05.210]  The environmental movement is fake.
[00:19:06.787 --> 00:19:09.248]  Now, does that mean there isn't real environmental problems?
[00:19:09.248 --> 00:19:10.149]  Of course there are.
[00:19:10.149 --> 00:19:14.351]  They co-opt everything that's real.
[00:19:14.351 --> 00:19:17.912]  They're co-opting the left.
[00:19:17.912 --> 00:19:21.794]  You think Bush is going to leave and then suddenly Barack Obama or Hillary are going to save us?
[00:19:21.794 --> 00:19:22.795]  It's going to be more of the same.
[00:19:22.795 --> 00:19:31.999]  It's going to accelerate the amnesty, the open borders, the globalism, the gun control, the taxation, the regulation.
[00:19:34.776 --> 00:19:35.596]  Why?
[00:19:35.596 --> 00:19:36.577]  It's an illusion.
[00:19:36.577 --> 00:19:39.418]  Why do people in the government have to serve this evil?
[00:19:39.418 --> 00:19:44.239]  Why do you have to be manipulated and be conned and believe a fairy tale?
[00:19:44.239 --> 00:19:47.020]  The mainstream reality is a hoax.
[00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:48.961]  I know what the real reality is and I have the proof.
[00:19:53.905 --> 00:19:56.607]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:19:56.607 --> 00:20:06.074]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:20:06.074 --> 00:20:13.160]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:19.862]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:20:19.862 --> 00:20:30.646]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:20:31.446 --> 00:20:31.766]  I think so.
[00:20:52.816 --> 00:20:55.677]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[00:20:55.677 --> 00:20:57.218]  Loose Change Final Cut.
[00:20:57.218 --> 00:20:59.379]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:20:59.379 --> 00:21:01.280]  The true story of the Bilderberg Group.
[00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:02.781]  The late great USA.
[00:21:02.781 --> 00:21:04.542]  America, freedom to fascism.
[00:21:04.542 --> 00:21:11.565]  These are just a few of the hundreds of powerful documentary films and books available at truthnews.us and prisonplanet.com.

[00:21:52.321 --> 00:21:56.425]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[00:21:56.425 --> 00:22:09.136]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[00:22:09.136 --> 00:22:09.596]  The U.S.
[00:22:09.596 --> 00:22:15.121]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[00:22:15.561 --> 00:22:18.524]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[00:22:18.524 --> 00:22:20.725]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[00:22:20.725 --> 00:22:23.688]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[00:22:23.688 --> 00:22:30.153]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[00:22:30.153 --> 00:22:33.596]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.
[00:22:33.596 --> 00:22:40.502]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for your free report on the outstanding level of public and private debt.
[00:22:40.502 --> 00:22:44.465]  You must understand how recession and depression are driven by outstanding debt.
[00:22:44.605 --> 00:22:46.567]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:46.567 --> 00:22:48.128]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:48.128 --> 00:22:54.073]  Hi, my name is William Lewis.
[00:22:54.073 --> 00:23:00.499]  And if you're listening to this radio station, then chances are, you've probably seen one or two of the documentaries that I've made over the years.
[00:23:00.499 --> 00:23:05.923]  9-1-1 In Plain Sight, Beyond Treason, or maybe 9-1-1 Ripple Effect.
[00:23:05.923 --> 00:23:12.069]  And by now, you've got to be as angry as I am, and wondering, what else have they done, and what are we going to do about it?
[00:23:12.873 --> 00:23:23.277]  My latest documentary, Washington You're Fired, was made to explore these ideas of change, while at the same time exposing the scope of the President's immoral and illegal spy program.
[00:23:23.277 --> 00:23:30.800]  We reveal the abuses committed under the Protection of the Patriot Act, Military Commissions Act, and other very intrusive spy bills.
[00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:39.044]  Washington You're Fired explores the removal of habeas corpus, posse comitatus, and the subversion of our entire Bill of Rights.

[00:24:28.188 --> 00:24:34.231]  Hey folks, being ignorant, I'm talking to people who are new listeners, isn't cute, it's not funny.
[00:24:34.231 --> 00:24:37.513]  You can't ignore what I'm saying, you can't laugh at it.
[00:24:37.513 --> 00:24:41.055]  I'm telling you the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.
[00:24:41.055 --> 00:24:47.178]  So help me God, my word of honor.
[00:24:47.178 --> 00:24:51.440]  You think I tell you not to vaccinate your children and I don't do the same for my children?
[00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:53.321]  I'm not going to tell you what to do.
[00:24:54.392 --> 00:24:56.595]  You just better find out what they're doing to you.
[00:24:56.595 --> 00:25:02.163]  You better find out real fast!
[00:25:02.163 --> 00:25:03.224]  It's a real frustration.
[00:25:03.224 --> 00:25:05.848]  I just want to reach tens of millions of people.
[00:25:05.848 --> 00:25:08.531]  I want to reach tens of millions more.
[00:25:08.531 --> 00:25:09.453]  I want to warn people.
[00:25:10.583 --> 00:25:18.107]  It'd be like if a bridge had collapsed in the middle of nowhere and I saw a car driving down the road and I knew it was about to go around a turn and drive off a cliff.
[00:25:18.107 --> 00:25:21.049]  I would sit out in the middle of that road.
[00:25:21.049 --> 00:25:28.733]  I'd set up a tent in the middle of that road till we could get up a barrier and until that bridge could get fixed and I'd warn people.
[00:25:28.733 --> 00:25:30.894]  And I guess nowadays that's weird.
[00:25:30.894 --> 00:25:35.136]  You know, they've trained you not to care about yourself, not to care about your neighbors, not to care about your children.
[00:25:35.136 --> 00:25:37.698]  They've trained you not to have your normal instincts.
[00:25:37.698 --> 00:25:40.099]  You just let CPS take your kids without due process.
[00:25:42.506 --> 00:25:44.587]  They've taken your instincts, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:44.587 --> 00:25:48.809]  I mean, I am so alive, and I look at other people, they look like they're half-dead.
[00:25:48.809 --> 00:25:49.810]  They're mesmerized.
[00:25:49.810 --> 00:25:50.810]  And you know why?
[00:25:50.810 --> 00:26:00.475]  The average adult, and it goes up every year, but a few years ago I saw the numbers, it had gone up since the last time I saw it, the average adult watches about 4 hours and 15 minutes a day.
[00:26:00.475 --> 00:26:05.977]  The average child is watching close to 6 hours a day.
[00:26:05.977 --> 00:26:11.060]  And just the numbers 10 years ago were more like 4 and a half hours for a child, 3 and a half for an adult.
[00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:11.640]  Go pull the numbers.
[00:26:13.424 --> 00:26:17.167]  I don't even know what they are now.
[00:26:17.167 --> 00:26:24.511]  And did you know that when you watch television for more than just a few minutes, it shifts you into a dream state?
[00:26:24.511 --> 00:26:27.153]  Ever wonder why it seems like hours pass by?
[00:26:27.153 --> 00:26:29.215]  You're watching television.
[00:26:29.215 --> 00:26:31.356]  You're mesmerized.
[00:26:31.356 --> 00:26:35.018]  And so it's keeping you in a lower state of consciousness.
[00:26:35.018 --> 00:26:36.219]  And I don't mean that in a New Age way.
[00:26:36.219 --> 00:26:39.962]  I mean consciousness in brainwaves, in measurable facts.
[00:26:41.317 --> 00:26:45.519]  You know, you read the philosophers, you read history, you read accounts.
[00:26:45.519 --> 00:26:53.662]  I mean, humans are seething with ideas, and passion, and creativity, and the good, the bad, and the ugly.
[00:26:53.662 --> 00:26:57.923]  The seven deadly sins, and of course, all the great virtues as well.
[00:26:57.923 --> 00:27:05.546]  We're seething with love, and passion, and lust, and avarice, and violence, and greed, but also in all the good things.
[00:27:11.034 --> 00:27:15.397]  And that's the great contest of life.
[00:27:15.397 --> 00:27:18.599]  And instead, you're living your life out in these simulations.
[00:27:18.599 --> 00:27:21.261]  You're not living it in reality.
[00:27:21.261 --> 00:27:24.243]  And so I know why a lot of people want to tune out.
[00:27:24.243 --> 00:27:29.426]  And they want to just be in la-la land and just, just, just eat food and drink and party and think about themselves.
[00:27:29.426 --> 00:27:31.647]  But, you know, you're totally unhappy.
[00:27:31.647 --> 00:27:37.211]  Because for a time, satiating the lower animal lust and levels is fun.
[00:27:37.211 --> 00:27:38.532]  And believe me, I've done it, folks.
[00:27:38.532 --> 00:27:39.973]  I didn't, you know, I've
[00:27:41.483 --> 00:27:45.044]  I mean, I grew up pretty wild, pretty young.
[00:27:45.044 --> 00:27:49.525]  The point is that I found none of that was satiating, none of that was satisfying.
[00:27:49.525 --> 00:27:56.227]  Sacrifice and adversity and courage and will is what's satisfying.
[00:27:56.227 --> 00:27:56.887]  And love.
[00:27:56.887 --> 00:28:02.929]  I mean, I have love for you, love for my family, love that is so intense it is painful.
[00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:14.032]  And it's painful that I am not even good enough to bring you this information, that I don't have some high view of myself.
[00:28:14.032 --> 00:28:14.712]  Understand that.
[00:28:14.712 --> 00:28:17.893]  But I have incredible passion.
[00:28:17.893 --> 00:28:20.533]  And again, I have ideas and understandings I can't even articulate.
[00:28:20.533 --> 00:28:21.853]  It's just, it's unbelievable.
[00:28:21.853 --> 00:28:23.414]  And I know I'm just average.
[00:28:23.414 --> 00:28:24.514]  All of you have this.
[00:28:24.514 --> 00:28:28.435]  And so you see reality, you see your real soul, you look into the universe,
[00:28:29.033 --> 00:28:33.216]  You stare out into the universe, you stare out into God's creation, and you become scared.
[00:28:33.216 --> 00:28:34.357]  You have anxiety.
[00:28:34.357 --> 00:28:35.378]  You look into reality.
[00:28:35.378 --> 00:28:39.241]  You look into this show, which is a window into reality, at least to a greater extent.
[00:28:39.241 --> 00:28:43.664]  We don't plan to have the end-all be-all on reality.
[00:28:43.664 --> 00:28:45.325]  And it makes your heart beat fast.
[00:28:45.325 --> 00:28:46.746]  It causes you anxiety.
[00:28:46.746 --> 00:28:51.130]  It causes you... Well, that's what it's like to look out into the Grand Canyon.
[00:28:51.130 --> 00:28:56.854]  It's awe-inspiring, but it's also... You feel a great passion, and that scares a lot of people.
[00:28:57.586 --> 00:29:04.451]  Or when you look into the night sky, or when you look into the eyes of your newborn child, you feel love, exhilaration, but also you think about your death.
[00:29:04.451 --> 00:29:07.833]  You think about that child's life that's coming, and how are you going to protect it?
[00:29:07.833 --> 00:29:12.617]  And the possibilities that to love is to have the possibility of losing.
[00:29:12.617 --> 00:29:14.418]  Will that child ever die in a car wreck?
[00:29:14.418 --> 00:29:15.999]  Will that child ever get cancer?
[00:29:15.999 --> 00:29:17.700]  Will that child ever get a brain tumor?
[00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:19.121]  Will that child get hurt?
[00:29:19.121 --> 00:29:20.482]  Will that child... See?
[00:29:20.482 --> 00:29:25.106]  But that's to live, to face those fears, and then to decide what do you do
[00:29:25.866 --> 00:29:28.387]  To try to take control of your environment.
[00:29:28.387 --> 00:29:38.971]  Instead, you're just drooling in a corner, watching television, not living in the real world, but you still know that you're missing something on life, and that is fully engaging life.
[00:29:38.971 --> 00:29:40.572]  And I challenge you to do that.
[00:29:40.572 --> 00:29:43.413]  We'll cover the news when we get back.
[00:29:43.413 --> 00:29:44.814]  We're on the march.
[00:29:44.814 --> 00:29:47.335]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:47.335 --> 00:29:50.036]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:53.444 --> 00:29:57.246]  Hello, I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, author of 15 books on health and natural healing.
[00:29:57.246 --> 00:30:01.368]  Vaccines included, medicines kill more people every year than any illness.
[00:30:01.368 --> 00:30:08.192]  The cost of drug side effects in America is more than $200 billion annually, with a worse toll taken by antibiotics.
[00:30:08.192 --> 00:30:11.074]  But there is a cure for this medical madness that has remained secret.
[00:30:11.474 --> 00:30:20.880]  OxySilver, developed by NASA scientists to keep astronauts healthy, is an evolutionary new dietary supplement making deadly vaccinations and antibiotics obsolete.
[00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:25.544]  Taking one to two teaspoons daily boosts natural immunity without drug toxicity.
[00:30:25.544 --> 00:30:28.646]  OxySilver combines oxygen and silver in a new way.
[00:30:28.646 --> 00:30:35.110]  The oxygen becomes a supercharged germ killer freeing your immune system to fight colds, flus, cancers, and more.
[00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:41.114]  Build disease defenses naturally, painlessly, powerfully, safely, and inexpensively with OxySilver.

[00:30:53.300 --> 00:31:06.452]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[00:31:06.452 --> 00:31:17.121]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of the horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[00:31:17.501 --> 00:31:20.903]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[00:31:20.903 --> 00:31:22.664]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.
[00:31:22.664 --> 00:31:28.806]  military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[00:31:44.434 --> 00:31:47.076]  We're in a no-holds-barred information war.
[00:31:47.076 --> 00:31:52.379]  Truth is our weapon, and PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:56.952]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:31:56.952 --> 00:32:02.354]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[00:32:02.354 --> 00:32:07.497]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[00:32:07.497 --> 00:32:18.622]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[00:32:19.022 --> 00:32:24.804]  The KDF dual media shower filter typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:32:24.804 --> 00:32:31.065]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[00:32:31.065 --> 00:32:32.105]  What about you?
[00:32:32.105 --> 00:32:34.106]  Order your KDF shower filter normally.

[00:33:20.956 --> 00:33:30.681]  If you think I sit around!
[00:33:43.919 --> 00:34:00.228]  As the world goes by, letting a bunch of criminal scum run my life and poison me and my family, you got another thing coming!
[00:34:00.228 --> 00:34:03.270]  No more Mr. Nice Guy.
[00:34:03.270 --> 00:34:05.611]  No more pushing me and my family around.
[00:34:05.611 --> 00:34:08.633]  And I'm here to tell all of you out there,
[00:34:10.272 --> 00:34:12.701]  We are gonna defeat the New World Order!
[00:34:12.701 --> 00:34:15.433]  We're gonna wake the human survival instinct up!
[00:34:17.893 --> 00:34:24.815]  And when we're done getting the New World Order out of our way, we are going to the stars!
[00:34:24.815 --> 00:34:27.176]  I can feel it in my gut!
[00:34:27.176 --> 00:34:30.037]  I know it in my soul!
[00:34:30.037 --> 00:34:34.158]  I am totally committed to this species!
[00:34:34.158 --> 00:34:38.540]  I am totally committed to Homo sapiens sapiens!
[00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:42.001]  We are going to defeat the sub aberrant predator class!
[00:34:42.001 --> 00:34:45.222]  We are going to release the true leadership that is humanity!
[00:34:46.063 --> 00:34:55.583]  We are going to move forward to the next level as we have been programmed and directed by the creator of the universe!
[00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:25.841]  I'll tell you one thing, I'm not going to live in a false reality!
[00:35:25.841 --> 00:35:30.683]  I'm not going to be conned by every con artist and every hoax that comes by!
[00:35:30.683 --> 00:35:32.964]  I'm not going to live like a slave!
[00:35:32.964 --> 00:35:34.504]  My soul is free!
[00:35:34.504 --> 00:35:35.885]  Free, you hear me?
[00:35:35.885 --> 00:35:37.605]  You don't own me, New World Order!
[00:35:37.605 --> 00:35:38.526]  I'm out of your control!
[00:35:38.526 --> 00:35:40.086]  It's so hot, no time to take a rest!
[00:35:40.086 --> 00:35:45.909]  Yeah, there's no place for second best!
[00:35:45.909 --> 00:35:47.909]  And I've been through my second best!
[00:36:06.466 --> 00:36:16.912]  We're gonna free humanity!
[00:36:16.912 --> 00:36:20.555]  The control freaks want to hold back our progress.
[00:36:21.599 --> 00:36:27.063]  The control freaks want to get in your way and sit on top of you and suck off of you!
[00:36:27.063 --> 00:36:29.825]  I want them out of the way!
[00:36:29.825 --> 00:36:37.530]  To all these little stunted bags of pus!
[00:36:37.530 --> 00:36:43.934]  To all these cowardly, weak control freaks that are programming our society!
[00:36:43.934 --> 00:36:48.257]  We're gonna wake the species up to the threat!
[00:36:48.257 --> 00:36:50.999]  You may have turned them into brainwashed, poisoned zombies!
[00:36:53.246 --> 00:36:57.909]  But their innate instincts are still there.
[00:36:57.909 --> 00:37:03.852]  Even their animal mind knows that you're the enemy.
[00:37:03.852 --> 00:37:10.395]  They know the truth, even if you've burned little holes in their cerebral cortex.
[00:37:10.395 --> 00:37:15.698]  Even though most of them are mindless zombies.
[00:37:15.698 --> 00:37:17.299]  They still know what you are.
[00:37:18.723 --> 00:37:23.005]  And they know the crime you're committing against our genetic code.
[00:37:23.005 --> 00:37:30.269]  They know the crime you're committing against this creation, this planet, in the middle of the universe.
[00:37:30.269 --> 00:37:37.453]  They know what you're doing, you wicked vandals, you pieces of filth, trash.
[00:37:37.453 --> 00:37:40.415]  You think we're your slaves, you've got another thing coming.
[00:37:44.605 --> 00:37:48.128]  I got so mad I think I ripped part of my throat and I got blood in my mouth.
[00:37:48.128 --> 00:37:54.573]  I am fired up, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:37:54.573 --> 00:37:55.534]  Just get real!
[00:37:55.534 --> 00:37:57.615]  Just realize how real the world is.
[00:37:57.615 --> 00:38:00.898]  You know, I want to get into their slave grid, their dehumanization grid.
[00:38:04.770 --> 00:38:07.392]  You got that clip I sent you, like, on Tuesday or Wednesday, John?
[00:38:07.392 --> 00:38:10.214]  I forgot to ask, you're in the break where it's that British newscast.
[00:38:10.214 --> 00:38:18.701]  Yeah, we aired part of it, where they're talking about our wonderful cards, our carbon cards, and how wonderful and how we're gonna make money with them when it's a tax.
[00:38:18.701 --> 00:38:21.643]  Notice how they introduce it to all the slaves.
[00:38:21.643 --> 00:38:24.746]  Notice how they push it to all the slaves.
[00:38:24.746 --> 00:38:28.048]  Notice how they unfold it to us, the slaves.
[00:38:28.048 --> 00:38:32.872]  I mean, just the way they announce it is a complete disgusting despotism.
[00:38:34.608 --> 00:38:43.535]  Oh yeah, they're going to give you a fraction of what it takes, the way they built this grid, where we've got to have carbon-based systems to travel, to live, to heat our homes, to survive.
[00:38:43.535 --> 00:38:47.958]  And they're going to set us at about half of what we need at first and ratchet that down.
[00:38:47.958 --> 00:38:52.762]  And then, yeah, I guess you can live homeless under a bridge, you'll have extra carbon credits and can sell it.
[00:38:52.762 --> 00:38:59.427]  So that's how they deceptively sell it so the cattle out there hear it and go, oh, I'll make money off the new tax, you idiots.
[00:38:59.427 --> 00:39:00.648]  Listen to this staged event.
[00:39:00.648 --> 00:39:02.069]  Just listen to your enemies.
[00:39:02.967 --> 00:39:08.069]  Would you live in a greener lifestyle if you could make money from it?
[00:39:08.069 --> 00:39:17.992]  That may be possible if a government proposal for personal carbon emissions allowances is implemented under the scheme, everyone in the UK would be allocated an annual carbon allowance.
[00:39:18.132 --> 00:39:24.614]  Stored electronically, rather like a supermarket loyalty card, points would be deducted every time we buy or use non-renewable energy.
[00:39:24.614 --> 00:39:28.415]  For example, using electricity to power appliances in the home.
[00:39:28.415 --> 00:39:30.416]  Or travelling somewhere by plane.
[00:39:30.416 --> 00:39:32.536]  Or even buying petrol for your car on the full course.
[00:39:32.536 --> 00:39:36.217]  Now, any points left over could then be sold back to a central bank.
[00:39:36.217 --> 00:39:37.218]  Are you still with us?
[00:39:37.218 --> 00:39:43.360]  And people who need more, like motorists who had used their allocations, could then pay for a top-up.
[00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:44.220]  Let's stop right there!
[00:39:45.180 --> 00:40:02.437]  Stop right there where that little tart is pushing propaganda with a sweet smiley girl next door face the corporate Engineers bring those in it's oh the nice girl next door nice front to sell you a dagger between your ribs right into your heart Black gouts of your soul pour out.
[00:40:02.437 --> 00:40:06.281]  What does she sit there and tell everybody?
[00:40:06.281 --> 00:40:08.744]  Oh You sell your carbon creds
[00:40:10.251 --> 00:40:23.440]  Back to the central bank, the private bankers literally having a tax on all interactions, all energy, with scores of bureaucrats, local, state, federal, international, feeding on you every facet of your life.
[00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:26.422]  I mean, it isn't just going to be a tax, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:40:26.422 --> 00:40:30.525]  It's going to be total control on everything you do.
[00:40:30.525 --> 00:40:34.888]  You think we're down to only 10% of the family farms we had 50 years ago?
[00:40:34.888 --> 00:40:35.829]  Get ready for none.
[00:40:36.644 --> 00:40:41.027]  Get ready for hell and a whole parasite class unleashed.
[00:40:41.027 --> 00:40:42.708]  You like 2 million cops in the US?
[00:40:42.708 --> 00:40:47.690]  How about 20 million?
[00:40:47.690 --> 00:40:49.131]  Oh God help us.
[00:40:49.131 --> 00:40:50.372]  Go back to these enemies.
[00:40:50.372 --> 00:40:51.813]  Go back to these slave masters.
[00:40:51.813 --> 00:40:53.474]  This is pure feudalism.
[00:40:53.474 --> 00:40:54.534]  Listen to them.
[00:40:54.534 --> 00:41:04.260]  You think they've been pushing and brainwashing with environmentalism and there's got to be a quote solution in classes for 50 years and brainwashing and spending trillions for nothing and they're now coming up.
[00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:09.424]  They're now with the NFL and all the major corporations pushing that it's real, global warming's real.
[00:41:09.424 --> 00:41:20.251]  Oh my gosh, the polar bears are all dying when their numbers are higher than ever, and oh my gosh, just lie after lie after lie after lie after lie after lie to get this through on you, with cities all over the U.S.
[00:41:20.251 --> 00:41:21.252]  passing carbon taxes.
[00:41:21.252 --> 00:41:25.715]  We got one of the minions coming on today.
[00:41:25.715 --> 00:41:27.997]  Oh, I got guest after guest for you coming up later.
[00:41:29.666 --> 00:41:33.389]  I am tormented, ladies and gentlemen, to watch this evil going into place.
[00:41:33.389 --> 00:41:35.290]  To know that they've stated what they're doing.
[00:41:35.290 --> 00:41:39.253]  Go ahead and buy the rest, please.
[00:41:39.253 --> 00:41:39.513]  Okay.
[00:41:40.205 --> 00:41:42.466]  For the petrol or the electricity, etc.
[00:41:42.466 --> 00:41:44.127]  We're here to discuss the proposals.
[00:41:44.127 --> 00:41:53.510]  Dr. Mary Hillman from the Policy Studies Institute and James Woodhousen, who's a professor of forecasting innovation at De Montfort University.
[00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:54.791]  Good morning to you both.
[00:41:54.791 --> 00:41:58.693]  It's a very intriguing idea, but will it work?
[00:41:58.693 --> 00:41:59.573]  Mary, let's start with you.
[00:41:59.773 --> 00:42:06.980]  Well, I first proposed the idea in 1990 and I'm delighted that the government is now seriously addressing this as an option.
[00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:10.623]  I believe it to be the only option for the future of mankind.
[00:42:10.623 --> 00:42:17.309]  The planet, as you know, is deteriorating in terms of its condition and the only way in which it can be addressed is not
[00:42:17.689 --> 00:42:17.949]  Right.
[00:42:17.949 --> 00:42:19.110]  James, that's the only option?
[00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:37.731]  No, I don't believe so.
[00:42:37.731 --> 00:42:50.579]  I think the whole attempt to make us feel guilty about what we're doing is very misguided and really we ought to be focusing on supply-side innovations rather than finger-wagging every time you boil a cup of tea.
[00:42:50.579 --> 00:42:51.720]  Supply-side innovations?
[00:42:51.940 --> 00:43:04.975]  Well, we need better power stations, we need tidal power, we need nuclear power, we need every kind of thing that makes a difference so that we can be more thoughtless about energy use and more thoughtful about the planning of future energy supply.
[00:43:06.937 --> 00:43:09.720]  Some people would say it's a nice idea, maybe, but it's completely impracticable.
[00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:17.548]  For instance, why would people who live in the country, who have to drive 10 miles to get to their shops, would be penalized for that?
[00:43:17.548 --> 00:43:22.353]  People who have to travel abroad on business, go across Atlanta, would presumably be penalized for that as well.
[00:43:22.353 --> 00:43:23.274]  See, stop right there!
[00:43:23.274 --> 00:43:25.857]  How would you ever get... See, they speak to the...
[00:43:27.210 --> 00:43:32.133]  Foolish, child-like, bed-wetting class that is the majority of the Western population now.
[00:43:32.133 --> 00:43:36.816]  Little ninnying, chicken-neck cowards that think the government cares about them and wants to take care of them.
[00:43:36.816 --> 00:43:39.638]  Notice how they present it to the zombies.
[00:43:39.638 --> 00:43:46.243]  They say, zombies, you're gonna make money off this when it's a total tax, total regulatory grid, with a card that tracks everything you buy, everything you do.
[00:43:46.243 --> 00:43:48.344]  As I told you years ago they would do, because it was on their own documents.
[00:43:49.065 --> 00:43:54.048]  And then they end up saying, oh, that will penalize people going off this old energy system, or even new ones.
[00:43:54.048 --> 00:43:55.989]  Oh, you're wanting to penalize people.
[00:43:55.989 --> 00:43:59.971]  And the little ninnies sit there and go, oh, penalize me.
[00:43:59.971 --> 00:44:02.072]  Oh, that penalizes me.
[00:44:02.072 --> 00:44:08.156]  I mean, it's just how knowingly deceptive these people are.
[00:44:08.156 --> 00:44:11.598]  It's so disgusting.
[00:44:11.598 --> 00:44:14.419]  It's just every bit of it's lies.
[00:44:14.419 --> 00:44:15.760]  I'll go back to them.
[00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:16.820]  How would you ever get it to work?
[00:44:18.601 --> 00:44:19.401]  Give me another solution.
[00:44:19.401 --> 00:44:20.422]  See, stop right there.
[00:44:20.422 --> 00:44:21.582]  How would you ever get it to work?
[00:44:21.582 --> 00:44:22.943]  These are all trained statements.
[00:44:22.943 --> 00:44:29.065]  Knowing the average person doesn't know how to screw in a light bulb, doesn't know how power gets to their house, doesn't know where meat comes from.
[00:44:29.065 --> 00:44:32.066]  I mean, really, I think it comes in packages.
[00:44:32.066 --> 00:44:35.687]  I've run into young people that think they do surgery on the cows to get the meat out.
[00:44:35.687 --> 00:44:37.788]  Yeah, they do a surgery all right.
[00:44:37.788 --> 00:44:40.569]  You know, this is what we're talking about.
[00:44:40.569 --> 00:44:42.770]  And so they say, how would you make it work?
[00:44:42.770 --> 00:44:45.711]  See, speaking to backside engineering,
[00:44:46.497 --> 00:44:50.378]  Knowing that the average person, if they don't know how it works, they don't think it exists.
[00:44:50.378 --> 00:44:55.259]  How would you make other energy systems work?
[00:44:55.259 --> 00:44:56.659]  The government says it's easy.
[00:44:56.659 --> 00:44:58.039]  I'll make money.
[00:44:58.039 --> 00:44:59.379]  I want the system.
[00:44:59.379 --> 00:45:00.880]  He's not giving me any details.
[00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:13.542]  He just says I'll make money off regulators and taxes and being arrested for dropping a banana peel or putting too much garbage in my trash can and having neighborhood watch squads controlling me and tracking everything I do on a
[00:45:14.342 --> 00:45:16.444]  On a debit card tracker system.
[00:45:16.444 --> 00:45:17.505]  I love it!
[00:45:17.505 --> 00:45:20.247]  Don't you give me details!
[00:45:20.247 --> 00:45:20.888]  See?
[00:45:20.888 --> 00:45:22.709]  Go back to it.
[00:45:22.709 --> 00:45:31.676]  Give me another solution to the serious problem of the fact that... But that's not to say how your system... Just saying others wouldn't work doesn't mean that yours would.
[00:45:31.676 --> 00:45:36.820]  Well, the detail can't be explained in the... See, the other guy understands their tactics.
[00:45:36.820 --> 00:45:38.402]  He understands purely.
[00:45:38.402 --> 00:45:39.823]  See, it's all like talking to a child.
[00:45:40.768 --> 00:45:44.410]  You can only fool a four-year-old, but the average Westerner is like a four-year-old.
[00:45:44.410 --> 00:45:45.231]  That won't work.
[00:45:45.231 --> 00:45:47.152]  That's not real.
[00:45:47.152 --> 00:45:51.274]  Oh, but a huge scam on carbon dioxide that plants breathe.
[00:45:51.274 --> 00:45:53.756]  Oxygen, carbon dioxide, sunlight, water.
[00:45:53.756 --> 00:45:57.398]  That's the four ingredients for life on this planet.
[00:45:57.398 --> 00:45:59.579]  And they're gonna have a corner on it.
[00:45:59.579 --> 00:46:02.021]  And they're gonna tax you to use it.
[00:46:02.021 --> 00:46:03.702]  That's a tax on breathing air.
[00:46:03.702 --> 00:46:05.463]  That's what they say it is.
[00:46:05.463 --> 00:46:07.404]  So, oh, yes.
[00:46:07.404 --> 00:46:08.504]  Oh, this is wonderful.
[00:46:08.504 --> 00:46:09.345]  It's for the Earth.
[00:46:09.921 --> 00:46:20.839]  You got all these idiot environmentalists who have no idea there's totally out of control genetic engineering that can any day, and already has had some problems, make the Andromeda strain look like a joke.
[00:46:20.839 --> 00:46:23.823]  I mean, that's the... It's stuff worse than that that you see in that old 70s movie.
[00:46:28.956 --> 00:46:37.798]  A minute or two, it is outlined in the report, in the book, the Penguin book I wrote called How We Can Save the Planet, and the detail is given there.
[00:46:37.798 --> 00:46:44.720]  The propositions that James has put forward, of course, are in no way invalidated by the concept of personal carbon rationing.
[00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:51.082]  In fact, it would drive the solutions that he is putting forward as people learn to live within the ration.
[00:46:51.082 --> 00:46:53.802]  You know, I'm really surprised that I am so incited.
[00:46:53.802 --> 00:46:56.383]  Learn to live within the ration!
[00:46:57.123 --> 00:46:58.344]  I have mainstream news.
[00:46:58.344 --> 00:47:03.688]  The British Parliament is announcing that everyone will live under rations like World War II.
[00:47:03.688 --> 00:47:05.729]  And now they get to control the energy.
[00:47:05.729 --> 00:47:06.970]  They get to jack up the price.
[00:47:06.970 --> 00:47:09.111]  Remember when they had rationing under Enron?
[00:47:09.111 --> 00:47:12.473]  And they stole 20-something billion dollars in just a few months from the people?
[00:47:12.473 --> 00:47:14.375]  Turned out they had plenty of power.
[00:47:14.375 --> 00:47:16.556]  This is the same thing.
[00:47:16.556 --> 00:47:25.122]  This is a con that will make all the income taxes, all the property taxes, all the security fees, all of it look like nothing.
[00:47:26.081 --> 00:47:35.507]  This is government and the private banks and the private energy companies raping the daylights out of you, where you'll have no money for anything, which they also control that.
[00:47:35.507 --> 00:47:48.075]  I mean, this is purely making the entire global economy and society a control system, where all the levels of energy input and the symbols of energy, the currency, are controlled by these people.
[00:47:48.075 --> 00:47:50.837]  This is a total monopoly.
[00:47:50.837 --> 00:47:53.819]  And they are going to squeeze you financially until your eyeballs pop out.
[00:47:54.560 --> 00:47:57.161]  And then when you can't pay for money, you'll go on government welfare?
[00:47:57.161 --> 00:48:00.083]  And your kids are going to grow up in government dormitories like in China?
[00:48:00.083 --> 00:48:01.243]  About half their kids do?
[00:48:01.243 --> 00:48:02.764]  It's all over, folks!
[00:48:02.764 --> 00:48:04.345]  HELL ON EARTH!
[00:48:04.345 --> 00:48:05.586]  It is now coming!
[00:48:05.586 --> 00:48:06.486]  Will you fight it?
[00:48:06.486 --> 00:48:08.387]  Will you educate your idiot neighbors?
[00:48:08.387 --> 00:48:12.749]  Will your idiot neighbors care enough?
[00:48:12.749 --> 00:48:14.250]  I just... I can't believe this.
[00:48:14.250 --> 00:48:19.433]  This is like... The analogy is... Seeing an 18-year-old woman leaving work...
[00:48:20.425 --> 00:48:25.649]  You know that it's Ted Bundy, yellow Volkswagen, he's gonna torture her, he's gonna kill her.
[00:48:25.649 --> 00:48:27.751]  You're basically restrained.
[00:48:27.751 --> 00:48:30.273]  You can't, you know, physically restrain her.
[00:48:30.273 --> 00:48:32.854]  And you're saying, he's not nice, he's bad, he's gonna kill you.
[00:48:32.854 --> 00:48:35.697]  He's, don't get in the car, don't, don't, please!
[00:48:35.697 --> 00:48:36.958]  And it's just, ahhh!
[00:48:36.958 --> 00:48:38.138]  I'm for the Earth!
[00:48:38.138 --> 00:48:39.960]  Oh, I love the government!
[00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:44.643]  Oh, this is for the penguins, I'm doing this!
[00:48:44.643 --> 00:48:45.884]  And I'm just going, no!
[00:48:45.884 --> 00:48:46.985]  God, no!
[00:48:46.985 --> 00:48:47.826]  But it isn't just you!
[00:48:49.031 --> 00:48:51.413]  It's not just you who I don't know out there, it's me!
[00:48:51.413 --> 00:48:52.694]  It's my family!
[00:48:52.694 --> 00:48:54.216]  It's my progeny!
[00:48:54.216 --> 00:49:07.267]  In a global total control grid, scientifically designed, as the head of the CFR Richard Haass wrote, to make humans the enemy, and the elite will direct the war against ourselves.
[00:49:07.267 --> 00:49:13.833]  A global, highly regulatory police state, run by vicious eugenicist control freaks.
[00:49:14.818 --> 00:49:23.203]  And once their grid's in place, and we're very close, we're less than 10 years out at current growth levels, they are then going to start wiping our butts out en masse.
[00:49:23.203 --> 00:49:31.528]  I mean, again, everything they've said, everything they've planned, everything the Club of Rome said they'd do in the 60s, by this time, they have done.
[00:49:31.528 --> 00:49:34.710]  They're about five years behind.
[00:49:34.710 --> 00:49:38.432]  They're at about 2002 levels, 2003 levels, what they said they'd be in 2000.
[00:49:43.737 --> 00:49:47.482]  I mean by that they're about 2003 levels for what they say they'd be in 2008.
[00:49:47.482 --> 00:49:52.309]  In 2000 they were at about 97 levels.
[00:49:52.309 --> 00:49:56.395]  I mean it's all there, all for you to read, all for you to find out, all for you to know.
[00:49:56.395 --> 00:49:59.359]  And I'm like somebody in one of those
[00:50:00.390 --> 00:50:15.200]  Old Temple of Doom type movies, but they had them back in the 40s and 50s, where they're in the pit and the sand's coming in, and the Egyptian pyramid, and the sand's raising up, it's gonna bury us, gonna kill us, and the sand's pouring in, and I'm going, look at the sand, look at the sand, we gotta, I need your help to push this lever.
[00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:17.922]  One person can't do it, we gotta push this lever and get out.
[00:50:17.922 --> 00:50:21.324]  And you're like, well, maybe there's not sand.
[00:50:21.324 --> 00:50:23.866]  I'm going, no, no, no, there's sand right there.
[00:50:23.866 --> 00:50:24.726]  It's pouring in.
[00:50:24.726 --> 00:50:25.827]  You're going, no, there's not sand.
[00:50:27.088 --> 00:50:28.289]  I'm like, you can see it right there.
[00:50:28.289 --> 00:50:30.250]  You can read their own documents, see their own policies.
[00:50:30.250 --> 00:50:32.231]  You're like, no, it doesn't exist.
[00:50:32.231 --> 00:50:34.473]  And now it's up to our chest.
[00:50:34.473 --> 00:50:35.894]  We're climbed up on top of the sand.
[00:50:35.894 --> 00:50:37.194]  We got to crouch down now.
[00:50:37.194 --> 00:50:38.975]  This is coming towards the ceiling.
[00:50:38.975 --> 00:50:42.858]  And you're just still giggling and laughing and snickering and doing everything you do.
[00:50:42.858 --> 00:50:44.979]  This isn't a joke, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:44.979 --> 00:50:46.080]  This is life and death.

[00:50:53.428 --> 00:51:06.554]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[00:51:06.554 --> 00:51:17.639]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[00:51:17.639 --> 00:51:19.860]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[00:51:21.041 --> 00:51:22.782]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.
[00:51:22.782 --> 00:51:28.925]  military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[00:51:44.574 --> 00:51:47.194]  We're in a no-holds-bar information war.
[00:51:47.194 --> 00:51:54.896]  Truth is our weapon, and PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[00:51:54.896 --> 00:51:59.557]  Another untold story, here it comes.
[00:51:59.557 --> 00:52:04.138]  Another untold story, here it comes.
[00:52:04.138 --> 00:52:11.539]  Another untold story that you've not been told from AnotherUntoldStory.com
[00:52:13.971 --> 00:52:16.892]  We'll call this story, Diggings and Dead Bodies.
[00:52:16.892 --> 00:52:28.835]  Archaeological diggings done by the Macalester Exploration Fund, 1904 to 1909 at Gieser and Macalester in the old land of the Canaanites, dug up remains of little children.
[00:52:28.835 --> 00:52:37.378]  Further archaeological exploration showed that the Canaanites' houses in Megiddo and Jericho had dead children concealed in the walls.
[00:52:38.448 --> 00:52:42.112]  One wonders what was going on there way back then.
[00:52:42.112 --> 00:52:45.956]  Archaeologists have an explanation, but it's gruesome and ugly.
[00:52:45.956 --> 00:52:53.483]  Then one wonders what was going on back, but not so far back, to about 200 years ago at the house of Ben Franklin.
[00:52:54.224 --> 00:53:07.832]  Benjamin Franklin's house at 36 Craven Street in London, the house he lived in in the 1700s there in London, that house where $1.9 million was spent in restoration to open it up to the public.
[00:53:07.832 --> 00:53:11.974]  Guess what workmen found buried underneath that house?
[00:53:11.974 --> 00:53:14.856]  And what could possibly be the explanation of that find?
[00:53:15.902 --> 00:53:20.443]  What was dug up was ugly and gruesome, but fast covered up by the media.
[00:53:20.443 --> 00:53:24.445]  Want to know the untold story we're calling diggings and dead bodies?

[00:54:24.656 --> 00:54:28.677]  You ever love someone so much you thought your little heart was gonna break in two?
[00:54:28.677 --> 00:54:31.018]  I didn't think so.
[00:54:31.018 --> 00:54:34.979]  You ever try with all your heart and soul to get your lover back to you?
[00:54:34.979 --> 00:54:37.340]  I wanna hope so.
[00:54:37.340 --> 00:54:42.081]  You ever pray with all your heart and soul just to watch her walk away?
[00:54:59.383 --> 00:54:59.723]  Yeah.
[00:54:59.723 --> 00:55:01.404]  Bottom line... I love humanity.
[00:55:01.404 --> 00:55:03.125]  I'm angry with humanity.
[00:55:03.125 --> 00:55:05.487]  I'm upset with humanity.
[00:55:29.315 --> 00:55:31.916]  Because I don't have a high view of myself.
[00:55:31.916 --> 00:55:34.758]  I don't.
[00:55:34.758 --> 00:55:42.562]  But I know the UN in every country, from Serbia to Rwanda, is run by pedophiles.
[00:55:42.562 --> 00:55:51.607]  They go in in every case, mass rape the children, put them on C-130s, fly them into Saudi Arabia, Israel, Thailand, snuff films, mass murder, everything.
[00:55:51.607 --> 00:55:52.207]  You don't believe me?
[00:55:52.207 --> 00:55:54.228]  It's even been in the mainstream news and nobody goes to jail.
[00:55:57.282 --> 00:56:02.625]  And sometimes I'll be at a family reunion or event and somebody, I'll tell them that and they'll just look at me like I'm nuts.
[00:56:02.625 --> 00:56:04.386]  Hey man, I'm not the crazy one.
[00:56:04.386 --> 00:56:09.750]  You're the crazy one for not knowing about it going on because you don't read newspapers.
[00:56:09.750 --> 00:56:16.894]  You know what it's like knowing that the evil has gotten into power and is now kicking out all the good people that were left and is now recruiting pure evil?
[00:56:16.894 --> 00:56:21.617]  The military is hiring thousands and thousands every month of aggravated felons and illegal aliens.
[00:56:25.968 --> 00:56:29.409]  These are the type of things that are so incredible, I have trouble believing them.
[00:56:29.409 --> 00:56:32.270]  You understand, things that have never happened are happening right now.
[00:56:32.270 --> 00:56:34.270]  Just, just, just, they're going for broke.
[00:56:34.270 --> 00:56:38.612]  The establishment is going for broke.
[00:56:38.612 --> 00:56:40.212]  Yesterday, it hit me on air.
[00:56:40.212 --> 00:56:49.135]  They haven't only stolen $4 trillion, taken all the pension funds, all the Pentagon investments of 50 years, and won't say where it went.
[00:56:49.135 --> 00:56:49.575]  Just gone.
[00:56:50.327 --> 00:56:54.670]  They've made 3 trillion in no-bid contracts and funding in the last 5 plus years.
[00:56:54.670 --> 00:56:56.552]  3 trillion!
[00:56:56.552 --> 00:56:58.553]  That's 7 trillion!
[00:56:58.553 --> 00:57:00.455]  You bet they're going for broke.
[00:57:00.455 --> 00:57:04.938]  You know how many police and militaries and intelligence agencies and private mercs?
[00:57:04.938 --> 00:57:10.582]  Of course they can pay these mercenaries 180 grand a year.
[00:57:10.582 --> 00:57:12.804]  And of course they can find men that'll do whatever they're told.
[00:57:12.804 --> 00:57:14.445]  Blackwater's got a black world worldwide.
[00:57:16.491 --> 00:57:19.893]  All you idiots are going, Blackwater, USA, give me a break.
[00:57:19.893 --> 00:57:22.835]  Cheney, the oil companies, they're all moving to Dubai.
[00:57:22.835 --> 00:57:24.236]  They're all moving to Switzerland.
[00:57:24.236 --> 00:57:25.736]  They're all moving to Portugal.
[00:57:25.736 --> 00:57:28.638]  They're all moving to Uruguay.
[00:57:28.638 --> 00:57:32.540]  All the big money is pulling out of this country.
[00:57:32.540 --> 00:57:34.181]  Because they're folding it in on itself.
[00:57:34.181 --> 00:57:38.063]  They are gonna do a Soviet massacre in here.
[00:57:38.063 --> 00:57:40.165]  This is how they reorganize, and then they'll come back in 20 years.
[00:57:44.528 --> 00:57:46.049]  You cops want to be on a power trip?
[00:57:46.049 --> 00:57:47.790]  You want to knock heads and kill some people?
[00:57:47.790 --> 00:57:50.252]  It's like an all-you-can-eat buffet.
[00:57:50.252 --> 00:57:57.276]  You might like one or two hot dogs to beat somebody up, taser somebody, act tough, SWAT team somebody, kill somebody.
[00:57:57.276 --> 00:58:00.037]  Makes you feel manly, put a notch on your belt.
[00:58:00.037 --> 00:58:01.618]  Part of your little power trip.
[00:58:01.618 --> 00:58:03.960]  How about eating 100 hot dogs a day?
[00:58:03.960 --> 00:58:08.122]  How about 200 hot dogs a day?
[00:58:08.122 --> 00:58:10.224]  You want to really kill some people?
[00:58:10.224 --> 00:58:11.544]  You're going to get a chance to.
[00:58:11.544 --> 00:58:13.105]  Did you know that, Bubba?
[00:58:13.105 --> 00:58:14.046]  They've been getting you ready for it.
[00:58:16.243 --> 00:58:21.885]  And you're gonna find out what that devil tattoo on your arm really means, officer.
[00:58:21.885 --> 00:58:26.327]  You're gonna get to see the killing fields, boy.
[00:58:26.327 --> 00:58:30.709]  You're gonna get to walk the walk you've been talking, big man.

[00:59:56.676 --> 00:59:59.557]  ...media, government cover-ups.
[00:59:59.557 --> 01:00:01.157]  You want answers?
[01:00:01.157 --> 01:00:02.698]  Well, so does he.

[01:00:11.740 --> 01:00:16.881]  We are now into hour number two.
[01:00:16.881 --> 01:00:22.283]  We have a city official coming on, I'm just going to leave it at that, where they're implementing
[01:00:26.605 --> 01:00:28.346]  A human feudalism tax.
[01:00:28.346 --> 01:00:29.746]  A total enslavement tax.
[01:00:29.746 --> 01:00:31.607]  I mean, I'm not joking when I use those terms.
[01:00:31.607 --> 01:00:35.008]  I've got to come up with something even more evil to describe it.
[01:00:35.008 --> 01:00:35.969]  Just a total tax.
[01:00:35.969 --> 01:00:37.189]  A total enslavement tax.
[01:00:37.189 --> 01:00:38.069]  A prison tax.
[01:00:38.069 --> 01:00:39.790]  A grid tax.
[01:00:39.790 --> 01:00:41.091]  A hell tax.
[01:00:41.091 --> 01:00:42.491]  An unspeakable tax.
[01:00:42.491 --> 01:00:43.651]  The end of the line tax.
[01:00:43.651 --> 01:00:44.912]  The ultimate tax.
[01:00:44.912 --> 01:00:46.693]  The final tax.
[01:00:46.693 --> 01:00:49.394]  The final solution tax.
[01:00:49.394 --> 01:00:50.814]  The extermination tax.
[01:00:50.814 --> 01:00:52.315]  The global genocide tax.
[01:00:56.855 --> 01:00:58.676]  Oh, God.
[01:00:58.676 --> 01:01:00.337]  We got another guest coming up who's against it all.
[01:01:00.337 --> 01:01:05.519]  Tell you about that later, too.
[01:01:05.519 --> 01:01:06.980]  I mean, here's the news I got in front of me.
[01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:18.745]  I told you I saw Homeland Security head Ridge say this, now five years ago, when he first got into Homeland Security.
[01:01:18.745 --> 01:01:19.826]  But here's Reuters today.
[01:01:21.388 --> 01:01:33.313]  Chirred off keen on Israeli airport security technology is the headline, and then they say it'll be on city streets and public places, that there's gonna be police asking you questions, searching you, no Fourth Amendment.
[01:01:33.313 --> 01:01:34.614]  I mean, that's why I won't go to Israel.
[01:01:34.614 --> 01:01:39.416]  I'd love to go to Israel and see the Holy Land, but I mean, I'm not gonna be interrogated, screamed at, yelled at.
[01:01:39.416 --> 01:01:42.237]  In-your-face policing is what it's called.
[01:01:42.237 --> 01:01:46.158]  Detained.
[01:01:46.158 --> 01:01:48.499]  What's that term Tony Montana uses?
[01:01:48.499 --> 01:01:49.880]  You want a Chivano in every corner?
[01:01:50.990 --> 01:01:52.850]  What's the term in Spanish he uses?
[01:01:52.850 --> 01:01:57.491]  For like a thug on the corner telling you, watching you, telling you what to sleep, how to sleep, what to wear, what to do.
[01:01:57.491 --> 01:02:06.733]  You want to be a sheep?
[01:02:06.733 --> 01:02:07.333]  And this is it.
[01:02:07.333 --> 01:02:18.235]  They're announcing the rollout of... I don't think I can handle it if I'm at the mall or walking down the street and just some thugs in black uniforms come up and it's already happening, but I'm just gonna go, get out of my face, trash!
[01:02:18.235 --> 01:02:19.555]  Get away from me, scum!
[01:02:20.607 --> 01:02:21.667]  Murdering filth!
[01:02:21.667 --> 01:02:22.788]  You work for murderers!
[01:02:22.788 --> 01:02:25.089]  You understand, you idiots?
[01:02:25.089 --> 01:02:30.050]  God, you make me sick!
[01:02:30.050 --> 01:02:34.452]  You're disgustingly foolish.
[01:02:34.452 --> 01:02:34.772]  U.S.
[01:02:34.772 --> 01:02:37.973]  Homeland Security Mossad agent, he's not even an American.
[01:02:37.973 --> 01:02:39.914]  Publicly, his mother founded Mossad.
[01:02:39.914 --> 01:02:45.155]  We have to have... Foreigners running everything.
[01:02:45.155 --> 01:02:46.796]  I mean, it's just, there's no end to the insults.
[01:02:47.759 --> 01:02:48.039]  U.S.
[01:02:48.039 --> 01:02:54.921]  Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said on Thursday he will seek to adopt novel Israeli methods like behavioral detection technology.
[01:02:54.921 --> 01:02:58.402]  This is because you're blinking your eyes when you go by a cop or frowning.
[01:02:58.402 --> 01:02:59.582]  That's, quote, probable cause.
[01:02:59.582 --> 01:03:01.583]  It's not, you scumbag.
[01:03:01.583 --> 01:03:03.903]  To better secure America's airports.
[01:03:03.903 --> 01:03:14.706]  The scenario where Israel has a lot of experience, Chertoff said in interviewing with Reuters, I think that it is of interest to us to see if there is any adaptation there.
[01:03:16.417 --> 01:03:24.321]  Israelis Ben-Gurion International Airport known for strict security measures relies heavily on techniques that detect suspicious behavior among travelers.
[01:03:24.321 --> 01:03:27.902]  Harassing old American ladies is their favorite.
[01:03:27.902 --> 01:03:34.145]  Chertoff said such methods as well as Israeli technologies that detect explosives are some of the things that may help protect U.S.
[01:03:34.145 --> 01:03:37.046]  airports and other public places against attacks.
[01:03:37.046 --> 01:03:43.449]  Then you go to his actual press conference and the press release and it says what we told you metal detectors in
[01:03:44.565 --> 01:03:49.967]  Malls, on the streets, vans driving around, saturation patrols, shotgun, any of the other terms.
[01:03:49.967 --> 01:03:55.649]  Just where they just randomly pull you over, randomly walk up to you, ask you questions.
[01:03:55.649 --> 01:03:56.690]  Oh, God.
[01:03:56.690 --> 01:04:00.551]  And a lot of them are going to be felons doing it.
[01:04:00.551 --> 01:04:13.236]  One of the new systems presented at the conference, developed by Israeli technology company WeSeeU, so that means the Homeland Security money is going right to his bosses in Israel, that's also part of this, uses behavioral science together with biometric sensors to detect sensor
[01:04:14.076 --> 01:04:15.296]  Intentions among travelers.
[01:04:15.296 --> 01:04:17.957]  I mean, are we gonna have to have Israelis running it?
[01:04:17.957 --> 01:04:27.540]  I guess they'll be our overlords, sitting up in skyboxes like they're putting up in New York, kind of just... I guess it'll be one big Palestine here.
[01:04:27.540 --> 01:04:29.821]  I guess they'll follow orders, so they'll do it.
[01:04:29.821 --> 01:04:32.682]  All part of the foreign troops.
[01:04:32.682 --> 01:04:37.123]  They're bringing in former Russian advisors, Israeli advisors, just anybody who hates this country.
[01:04:39.341 --> 01:04:41.602]  I guess Israel... I guess it's true what people are saying.
[01:04:41.602 --> 01:04:44.424]  I guess Israel is almost like fully taking over the U.S.
[01:04:44.424 --> 01:04:49.447]  It's kind of... Talk about a... Bug eating a lion.
[01:04:50.563 --> 01:04:52.524]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[01:04:52.524 --> 01:04:56.146]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.

[01:05:50.722 --> 01:05:53.906]  Hi neighbor, this is Steve Shank, Fearless Task Force.
[01:05:53.906 --> 01:05:56.428]  Life is a gamble, but you can stack the deck.
[01:05:57.410 --> 01:06:07.359]  If you knew what I know about all the problems food will protect you from, you'd start immediately to put every effort and dollar you can get into the biggest supply of food possible.
[01:06:07.359 --> 01:06:12.604]  When the dollar and economy crash, when the imported and genetically poisoned food is all that's left,
[01:06:13.244 --> 01:06:21.810]  When the quarantine and bird flu hit, our only protection and only chance to be fearless is having control of our own supply of food and enough of it.
[01:06:21.810 --> 01:06:30.016]  But if you knew what we haven't yet discovered, you wouldn't waste time listening to the rest of this announcement before charging out and getting a serious food supply.
[01:06:30.016 --> 01:06:33.239]  Decide, it's food now or probably never.
[01:06:33.239 --> 01:06:35.220]  But can you afford to be wrong?
[01:06:35.220 --> 01:06:36.401]  Decide now.
[01:06:36.401 --> 01:06:37.122]  Place your bet.
[01:06:37.942 --> 01:06:39.784]  Can you afford to be wrong?

[01:07:08.846 --> 01:07:13.989]  It uses a little electricity from your car's battery to separate water into a gas called HHO.
[01:07:13.989 --> 01:07:19.852]  HHO, also called Brown's Gas, burns beautifully and provides tons of energy, while the end product is just water.

[01:07:50.305 --> 01:07:55.708]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:07:55.708 --> 01:08:06.233]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:06.233 --> 01:08:13.036]  Michael Chertoff has announced what Governor Ridge, Homeland Security head before him, said.
[01:08:13.036 --> 01:08:18.179]  The Attorney General saying that Israel is going to advise and basically their companies are going to run.
[01:08:19.873 --> 01:08:35.277]  Domestic, uh, surveillance training the police and local Tattletail squads to claim that your facial mannerisms are an excuse to come up and talk to you, search you, metal detectors everywhere, basically Viper teams everywhere randomly searching you.
[01:08:35.277 --> 01:08:41.139]  And then he mixed into that border security how they're gonna build 500 miles of fence.
[01:08:41.139 --> 01:08:47.781]  All they gotta do is take the Marine Expeditionary Unit they're gonna have in Indiana, training everybody for martial law in a few days, admittedly,
[01:08:49.309 --> 01:08:55.871]  And stick them down there and open fire on Mexican troops when they shoot at us every day, and things would end real quick.
[01:08:55.871 --> 01:09:00.012]  All they gotta do is start truly prosecuting employers that hire illegal aliens.
[01:09:00.012 --> 01:09:01.433]  I mean, throw the book at them.
[01:09:01.433 --> 01:09:08.835]  And I mean, thousands of prosecutions a month, which... They normally love to raise money and do all that, but something that's actually constitutional, they won't do.
[01:09:08.835 --> 01:09:17.758]  In fact, they'll have federal judges tell, uh, a suburb of, uh, Dallas, Oh, you can't ask for, uh, citizenship to get an apartment.
[01:09:18.786 --> 01:09:26.333]  Oh, you gotta ask a citizen for an ID card and a bank statement and make sure that they don't have any liens against them or they've paid their taxes.
[01:09:26.333 --> 01:09:30.116]  Citizens have to prove themselves, but an illegal alien doesn't.
[01:09:30.993 --> 01:09:34.955]  And I had a bunch of illegal aliens or somebody posting on InfoWars in the comment stories.
[01:09:34.955 --> 01:09:46.340]  We posted some dry, you know, few paragraphs with a link to a Miami story about how the majority of people speak Spanish and you can't really get a job if you don't speak Spanish in one of the most populous cities in the U.S.
[01:09:46.340 --> 01:09:49.401]  And they were in there saying I'm a racist and hate Mexicans and Hispanics.
[01:09:49.401 --> 01:09:50.061]  Give me a newsflash.
[01:09:50.061 --> 01:09:51.882]  I could care less, buddy boy.
[01:09:52.608 --> 01:09:53.829]  What color your skin is.
[01:09:53.829 --> 01:09:55.309]  I really don't care.
[01:09:55.309 --> 01:09:56.670]  You understand that?
[01:09:56.670 --> 01:10:03.633]  I'm trying to keep Planned Parenthoods out of your neighborhoods where they're killing your little Latino babies, you idiots!
[01:10:03.633 --> 01:10:06.674]  Why don't you go stop the death mills in your communities, morons?
[01:10:06.674 --> 01:10:09.276]  Stop people posting in my site.
[01:10:09.276 --> 01:10:12.257]  I know what's being said on the Spanish radio stations.
[01:10:12.257 --> 01:10:14.358]  I know what the names of them are.
[01:10:14.358 --> 01:10:17.940]  So stop acting like I'm the racist and the tribalist when it's you
[01:10:21.761 --> 01:10:29.248]  Makes me want to throw up in there about how I'm a gringo pig.
[01:10:29.248 --> 01:10:36.694]  I mean, you're in there calling me a racist, but then laughing about how I'm a fat gringo pig.
[01:10:36.694 --> 01:10:37.115]  Oh, really?
[01:10:37.115 --> 01:10:39.277]  Am I calling you names?
[01:10:39.277 --> 01:10:43.080]  Do I call black people Mayottas, which means black birds?
[01:10:43.080 --> 01:10:43.901]  Do I call you
[01:10:45.444 --> 01:10:46.765]  Racial slurs?
[01:10:46.765 --> 01:10:50.086]  See, it's supposedly okay for you to, but not me.
[01:10:50.086 --> 01:10:50.686]  I'm done!
[01:10:50.686 --> 01:10:51.487]  The guilt's over!
[01:10:51.487 --> 01:10:52.847]  The buffaloing is over!
[01:10:52.847 --> 01:10:53.547]  You understand?
[01:10:53.547 --> 01:10:54.188]  IT'S OVER!
[01:10:54.188 --> 01:10:59.770]  I don't care what you think about me!
[01:10:59.770 --> 01:11:01.291]  Any of you!
[01:11:01.291 --> 01:11:13.756]  Stupid white yuppies, dumb racist black people, Asians, Mexicans, Nicaraguans, El Salvadorans, I don't care what you think about me!
[01:11:14.412 --> 01:11:19.536]  You run around, and they were saying, Viva La Roz, Alex is a fat gringo pig, and all this stuff.
[01:11:19.536 --> 01:11:22.219]  Up with our race, you're a fat white pig.
[01:11:22.219 --> 01:11:24.761]  That's real cute!
[01:11:24.761 --> 01:11:26.422]  Am I calling you names?
[01:11:26.422 --> 01:11:27.043]  No, I'm not.
[01:11:27.043 --> 01:11:31.787]  I'm saying, how dare you run around, work for the New World Order, which you do, whether you know it or not.
[01:11:31.787 --> 01:11:34.709]  They all give you first-class treatment.
[01:11:34.709 --> 01:11:35.810]  I get third-class treatment.
[01:11:37.734 --> 01:11:38.134]  You know why?
[01:11:38.134 --> 01:11:39.775]  Because I'm a dumb white hog.
[01:11:39.775 --> 01:11:40.775]  I really am.
[01:11:40.775 --> 01:11:47.698]  And I'm here, I've got the mark on me to be sucked off of because I think I'm free and I think I had it made and I think I was the boss.
[01:11:47.698 --> 01:11:50.880]  So because I think I'm on top, I'll go along with anything.
[01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:54.041]  That's what white people are.
[01:11:54.041 --> 01:11:58.203]  It's a disgusting group of trash.
[01:11:58.203 --> 01:12:04.646]  But you, people out there who hate every other group, but then say you're not trash, you're trash too.
[01:12:06.070 --> 01:12:20.199]  You're trashy because you don't understand the New World Order lets you offer DWIs, lets you offer no ID, but throws the book at a Mexican-American, or a black person, or a white person, or an Asian, or a... African albino.
[01:12:20.199 --> 01:12:21.580]  They don't care, folks.
[01:12:21.580 --> 01:12:28.204]  If you're a scum, when you've got your ID, it means you've been conditioned, trained, you're there to be raped and fed on and bled.
[01:12:28.204 --> 01:12:35.349]  We're kinda like, uh, that, uh, there's one African tribe that drinks the blood, mixes it with milk and stuff for their cows, for protein,
[01:12:36.735 --> 01:12:37.436]  They're in Kenya.
[01:12:37.436 --> 01:12:38.297]  I forget the name of the tribe.
[01:12:38.297 --> 01:12:40.759]  That's kind of like what we are as Americans.
[01:12:40.759 --> 01:12:41.780]  They walk up.
[01:12:41.780 --> 01:12:44.643]  They got a little hammer with a little wood stick.
[01:12:44.643 --> 01:12:49.868]  They hit the artery on the neck and get a bucket of blood and then clot it up.
[01:12:49.868 --> 01:12:53.551]  And they go mix it actually with urine and milk and drink it.
[01:12:53.551 --> 01:12:54.292]  That's the government.
[01:12:57.631 --> 01:12:58.551]  That's what we are.
[01:12:58.551 --> 01:13:08.356]  The cop just pulls up, you know, any excuse, knocks a hole in the order, he sucks some blood out, drives off, goes and gives his kid the next day a shot that brain damages him for life.
[01:13:08.356 --> 01:13:12.737]  You're getting sucked off of too, brother.
[01:13:12.737 --> 01:13:16.179]  Oh man, I'm in full rant mode today, because I can't handle it anymore.
[01:13:16.179 --> 01:13:17.419]  I just can't handle it anymore.
[01:13:17.419 --> 01:13:25.343]  And I've been working really hard and I always slept like a rock my whole life, but man, I get in bed now and I feel real melancholy and upset and I'm worried about everybody.
[01:13:26.124 --> 01:13:31.147]  And I want to warn people, and I want to be stoic, and I want to be well-spoken, and I want to be nice about it.
[01:13:31.147 --> 01:13:36.530]  And just all the craziness, and the badness I see in the average people, and the badness I see in the system.
[01:13:36.530 --> 01:13:38.451]  And also, then there's the good I see in everybody.
[01:13:38.451 --> 01:13:40.172]  It's so beautiful, so wonderful.
[01:13:40.172 --> 01:13:52.238]  There's so much great things in life, and then there's all this trash and scum everywhere!
[01:13:52.238 --> 01:13:54.399]  See, they haven't cut my instincts out.
[01:13:54.399 --> 01:13:55.600]  I mean, I'm behaving normally.
[01:13:56.255 --> 01:14:06.598]  I've discovered there's a global criminal elite that's poisoning my water and my food, that's waging war on me and building a prison grid so they can orderly enslave or exterminate me.
[01:14:06.598 --> 01:14:07.619]  And I'm pissed, man.
[01:14:07.619 --> 01:14:08.219]  I'm angry.
[01:14:08.219 --> 01:14:09.259]  I'm upset.
[01:14:09.259 --> 01:14:11.780]  I'm worried.
[01:14:11.780 --> 01:14:14.161]  I can't, quote, enjoy my notoriety.
[01:14:14.161 --> 01:14:15.321]  I can't enjoy.
[01:14:15.321 --> 01:14:18.342]  You think I enjoy being Alex Jones?
[01:14:18.342 --> 01:14:20.543]  You think I enjoy being at the tip of the spear?
[01:14:24.045 --> 01:14:27.226]  Many years ago, I might have a little bit, but I don't enjoy it now.
[01:14:27.226 --> 01:14:28.847]  Because I know it means nothing.
[01:14:28.847 --> 01:14:35.110]  It's an illusion.
[01:14:35.110 --> 01:14:36.590]  See, people want what they don't have.
[01:14:36.590 --> 01:14:43.613]  Once you got it, you figure out it's not that good.
[01:14:43.613 --> 01:14:44.493]  I talked to a lot of people.
[01:14:44.493 --> 01:14:51.917]  They think Hollywood stars and famous people float around on clouds and live some different life.
[01:14:51.917 --> 01:14:52.957]  And they do live a different life.
[01:14:53.919 --> 01:14:58.762]  People are obsessed with them and it's a cage.
[01:14:58.762 --> 01:15:06.345]  And a lot of them get to where they realize it's all a big illusion and hate it and hate the fact that they're famous and just want to hide.
[01:15:06.345 --> 01:15:11.588]  But me, it's not like I'm some Hollywood star.
[01:15:11.588 --> 01:15:17.091]  No, I'm becoming a global cult icon.
[01:15:17.091 --> 01:15:20.713]  And I don't think I live up to that when I see myself in hindsight.
[01:15:21.934 --> 01:15:28.536]  All it does is shove me further towards a collision with these sick New World Order freaks.
[01:15:28.536 --> 01:15:30.717]  Then I kind of selfishly in 3 a.m.
[01:15:30.717 --> 01:15:33.898]  wake up and think, man, why did I do this?
[01:15:33.898 --> 01:15:41.121]  But then I realize I have to make the sacrifice regardless because the New World Order was going to carry out their plans against me whether I ever woke up or not.
[01:15:41.121 --> 01:15:42.882]  So thank God I know the truth.
[01:15:42.882 --> 01:15:49.384]  Then I think how selfish I am when I'm thinking about myself and thinking about what if I would have never gotten involved with all of this.
[01:15:50.191 --> 01:15:51.491]  But I didn't have any control of that.
[01:15:51.491 --> 01:15:57.932]  That was destiny.
[01:15:57.932 --> 01:15:59.293]  We're doing very important work here.
[01:15:59.293 --> 01:16:01.193]  This is a war.
[01:16:01.193 --> 01:16:01.973]  And we're not perfect.
[01:16:01.973 --> 01:16:04.914]  We have a lot of problems, a lot of warts.
[01:16:04.914 --> 01:16:05.514]  But you know what?
[01:16:05.514 --> 01:16:08.394]  We mean good, and we are doing the best we can.
[01:16:08.394 --> 01:16:18.276]  And there's nobody fighting like us, and... If I do anything, I don't do it halfway, so I would just say, it's up to you whether you want to support the money bomb,
[01:16:18.999 --> 01:16:19.779]  We have coming up.
[01:16:19.779 --> 01:16:26.122]  Let me go to InfoWars.com and see how many hours away we are.
[01:16:26.122 --> 01:16:30.024]  Central Standard Time to the Money Bomb.
[01:16:30.024 --> 01:16:38.308]  Starting tonight, we are 11 hours, 43 minutes, 25 seconds away from it starting.
[01:16:38.308 --> 01:16:43.210]  Well, there is a press release out by Paul Watson up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[01:16:43.210 --> 01:16:44.391]  Hope you get it out to everybody.
[01:16:45.162 --> 01:16:56.886]  I'm doing a special live show just on the internet streams at InfoWars.com from 8 to midnight tomorrow night.
[01:16:56.886 --> 01:17:04.669]  But I read this, Chertoff keen on Israeli airport security technology on the streets of America.
[01:17:04.669 --> 01:17:10.031]  And it says that an Israeli company is going to get multi-billion dollar contracts to run this on the streets of America.
[01:17:13.444 --> 01:17:17.346]  Then he mixes it in with a 500-mile border fence being built by illegal aliens.
[01:17:17.346 --> 01:17:23.890]  That's not a joke, by the way.
[01:17:23.890 --> 01:17:25.551]  It's such a hoax.
[01:17:25.551 --> 01:17:34.096]  Better chance of being struck by lightning than dying of terrorism, even if you believe it's not government-sponsored.
[01:17:34.096 --> 01:17:41.521]  But our whole world, our whole life, trillions of dollars has got to go into these no-bid contracts domestically and trillions overseas to fight something imaginary.
[01:17:43.334 --> 01:17:46.596]  I mean, I saw on the news last night, I was watching TV late at night, I just had to turn it on.
[01:17:46.596 --> 01:17:59.801]  I was watching MSNBC and they were announcing, I saw the article too yesterday, it was in the news wires, about, yeah, White House is releasing info, Iran's definitely having secret summits with Al-Qaeda.
[01:17:59.801 --> 01:18:07.445]  I mean, the way they insult your intelligence, the way they, it's so incredible to see a lie of that magnitude repeated daily.
[01:18:11.693 --> 01:18:13.393]  Iran is Shiite!
[01:18:13.393 --> 01:18:17.774]  The United States criminal government that's destroyed our country's name and currency.
[01:18:17.774 --> 01:18:20.915]  It's not our government.
[01:18:20.915 --> 01:18:33.077]  For at least four years has been bombing, shooting, attacking police and military, schools, anything to elicit attacks back by the Iranians by the number three in Al Qaeda known CIA operative.
[01:18:33.077 --> 01:18:38.318]  And the White House last year admitted it and put out a press release saying, yes, we're working with these three groups.
[01:18:38.999 --> 01:18:49.487]  Wahhabis out of Saudi Arabia, and then the media, I know I keep saying it, I can't believe the hoax of that magnitude!
[01:18:49.487 --> 01:18:55.311]  They talk to you like you're complete morons, and I guess you are, because it works!
[01:18:55.311 --> 01:19:03.837]  Meanwhile, I gotta have idiot Austin cops doing saturation patrols and checkpoints, and they'll tell you at the checkpoints, oh, we do this post 9-11.
[01:19:07.543 --> 01:19:09.684]  You understand you work for a criminal system.
[01:19:09.684 --> 01:19:11.264]  You understand what you're doing is un-American.
[01:19:11.264 --> 01:19:12.825]  You didn't do it before.
[01:19:12.825 --> 01:19:15.426]  Don't give me your bull!
[01:19:15.426 --> 01:19:25.230]  Don't come up to me when I got a Ron Paul sign and tell me to get off the street corner when there's a guy down the street with a sandwich board advertising some tax place.
[01:19:25.230 --> 01:19:27.331]  It's disgusting what you've become.
[01:19:27.331 --> 01:19:29.011]  It's disgusting what you do.
[01:19:29.011 --> 01:19:34.193]  You ought to be ashamed of yourselves calling yourselves Americans.
[01:19:34.193 --> 01:19:35.494]  And that I'm a radical.
[01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:45.726]  Here on air saying we don't want domestic federal checkpoints and federally trained local police with mobile metal detector vans.
[01:19:45.726 --> 01:19:50.329]  I mean, it doesn't get any more Soviet Union, East Germany, Communist China than that.
[01:19:52.561 --> 01:19:54.003]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:19:54.003 --> 01:20:00.069]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[01:20:00.069 --> 01:20:00.870]  That's right.
[01:20:00.870 --> 01:20:04.574]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[01:20:04.574 --> 01:20:10.641]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[01:20:11.201 --> 01:20:19.345]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:20:19.345 --> 01:20:24.808]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[01:20:24.808 --> 01:20:30.630]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:30.630 --> 01:20:35.152]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[01:20:35.152 --> 01:20:35.433]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:35.433 --> 01:20:37.233]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[01:20:40.475 --> 01:20:40.776]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:40.776 --> 01:20:40.976]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:51.383 --> 01:20:55.166]  It is now time to reign in evil and bring them to justice.
[01:20:55.166 --> 01:21:00.189]  Through the authority that has been delegated to us, it is time to destroy the destroyers.
[01:21:00.189 --> 01:21:05.673]  The number of the mounted troops was 200 million, the vast majority of the population of the U.S.
[01:21:05.673 --> 01:21:16.161]  Though the people of the U.S., where their numbers and influence are strongest, have primary responsibility for reigning them in and bringing them to justice, all nations will participate since they reside the world over.
[01:21:16.641 --> 01:21:21.044]  They are called Illuminati, elite, proponents of the New World Order.
[01:21:21.044 --> 01:21:23.827]  They oppose everything that is God and truth.
[01:21:23.827 --> 01:21:27.389]  They are of the line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago.
[01:21:27.389 --> 01:21:39.899]  Everything they have built over the centuries, the wealth they have accumulated, the power they have established, the poisoning of the masses, the destruction of the Earth and mankind, we will undo through the authority that has now been delegated to us.
[01:21:40.359 --> 01:21:44.108]  Visit our website at unveilingthem.com.
[01:21:44.108 --> 01:21:48.419]  That's U-N-V-E-I-L-I-N-G them dot com.
[01:21:48.419 --> 01:21:49.682]  The message of His Kingdom.
[01:21:50.754 --> 01:21:52.735]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:21:52.735 --> 01:21:59.697]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[01:21:59.697 --> 01:22:08.100]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:22:08.100 --> 01:22:13.822]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:22:14.222 --> 01:22:15.843]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[01:22:15.843 --> 01:22:18.143]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:22:18.143 --> 01:22:22.565]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:22:22.565 --> 01:22:24.785]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.

[01:22:50.243 --> 01:22:51.344]  Storable food!
[01:22:51.344 --> 01:22:52.364]  Storable food!
[01:22:52.364 --> 01:22:56.567]  HempUSA.org has an inexpensive, nutritionally dense, high-frequency food.
[01:22:56.567 --> 01:23:07.774]  Hemp, known around the world, will boost your immune system and increase energy levels, detoxifies the body and reduces junk food cravings, burns fat and builds muscle, and is easy to digest, non-allergenic, and gluten-free.
[01:23:07.774 --> 01:23:11.896]  Can be made into smoothies, breads, muffins, pancakes, cookies, you name it!
[01:23:11.896 --> 01:23:14.718]  The entire planet should make this a staple food in their diet.
[01:23:14.718 --> 01:23:16.539]  The seeds will scrape the colon wall.
[01:23:16.539 --> 01:23:18.520]  The powder will feed the body vital minerals.
[01:23:18.680 --> 01:23:19.200]  We're good to go.
[01:23:41.852 --> 01:23:45.815]  908-691-2608 at hempusa.org.
[01:23:45.815 --> 01:24:00.267]  And remember, let your food be your medicine, and your medicine be your food.
[01:24:00.267 --> 01:24:03.010]  It's hard to start playing this song and not listening to the end.
[01:24:07.486 --> 01:24:25.872]  See down in Louisiana close to New Orleans Way back up in the woods among the evergreens There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode Who never ever learned to read or write so well But he could play a guitar just like a ring and a bell Go, go!
[01:24:25.872 --> 01:24:27.453]  Go, Johnny, go, go!
[01:24:28.694 --> 01:24:38.409]  Go Johnny, go, go Go Johnny, go, go Go Johnny, go, go Johnny B. Goode
[01:24:41.148 --> 01:24:43.910]  He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack.
[01:24:43.910 --> 01:24:46.931]  Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track.
[01:24:46.931 --> 01:24:49.893]  Oh, the engine and the train sitting in the shade.
[01:24:49.893 --> 01:24:52.654]  Strumming with the rhythm that the drivers made.
[01:24:52.654 --> 01:24:58.257]  The people passing by, they were stopping to say, Oh my, was that a little country boy could play.
[01:24:58.257 --> 01:24:58.957]  Go, go.
[01:24:58.957 --> 01:25:00.058]  Go, Johnny, go, go.
[01:25:00.058 --> 01:25:01.478]  Go, Johnny, go, go.
[01:25:01.478 --> 01:25:02.959]  Go, Johnny, go, go.
[01:25:02.959 --> 01:25:04.600]  Go, Johnny, go, go.
[01:25:28.627 --> 01:25:36.270]  It's real simple what happened.
[01:25:36.270 --> 01:25:42.073]  About a hundred years ago, the big money men said, hey, it's the age of science.
[01:25:42.073 --> 01:25:49.696]  Scientists tell us how to fully enslave the public forever, so they can never revolt against us.
[01:25:49.696 --> 01:25:51.157]  And they said, okay, here's the answer.
[01:25:52.782 --> 01:25:54.003]  And they've done it!
[01:26:15.214 --> 01:26:17.715]  They have gotten the average person to tune out of reality.
[01:26:17.715 --> 01:26:20.056]  People just accept their car starts.
[01:26:20.056 --> 01:26:21.617]  They accept they drive down the road.
[01:26:21.617 --> 01:26:22.858]  The grocery store has food.
[01:26:22.858 --> 01:26:26.159]  The cops are there in black uniforms stopping them.
[01:26:26.159 --> 01:26:28.100]  The illegal aliens are above the law.
[01:26:28.100 --> 01:26:32.522]  We've just all been trained to accept all of this.
[01:26:32.522 --> 01:26:35.183]  Scientists signed petition denying man-made global warming.
[01:26:35.183 --> 01:26:40.346]  More than 31,000 scientists have signed a petition denying that man is responsible for global warming.
[01:26:41.072 --> 01:26:46.615]  The European Union has responded by now attempting to pass a law saying it's illegal to deny it.
[01:26:46.615 --> 01:26:48.036]  Folks, this isn't a joke.
[01:26:48.036 --> 01:26:49.677]  This is tyranny.
[01:26:49.677 --> 01:26:57.101]  The academics, including 9,000 with PhDs, claim that greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane are actually beneficial for the environment.
[01:26:57.101 --> 01:26:58.942]  Well, of course they are.
[01:26:58.942 --> 01:27:01.764]  Four things drive planetary life cycle.
[01:27:01.764 --> 01:27:10.349]  Oxygen, carbon dioxide, solar radiation in all of its bandwidths and different forms, all its wavelengths, and of course, water.
[01:27:12.489 --> 01:27:14.651]  Doesn't matter.
[01:27:14.651 --> 01:27:20.516]  Because Mr. Chertoff is going to have foreign intelligence agencies running security in the U.S.
[01:27:20.516 --> 01:27:22.658]  as a good Mossad officer.
[01:27:22.658 --> 01:27:26.001]  What is the definition of a coup d'etat?
[01:27:26.001 --> 01:27:33.387]  It is a small criminal group within the government who then rapidly take over the rest of the government.
[01:27:33.387 --> 01:27:37.311]  I saw a better exact definition of that just the other day.
[01:27:39.016 --> 01:27:41.938]  And I do not think Israel is the only player in all of this.
[01:27:41.938 --> 01:27:44.539]  You know, the British Anglo-American establishment is dominant.
[01:27:44.539 --> 01:27:46.520]  But I have to call a spade a spade.
[01:27:46.520 --> 01:28:04.589]  I mean, when they're moving in all these Mossad agents into every power position, I mean, Homeland Security head, Attorney General, when they are doing things like that, it gets very, very serious.
[01:28:06.277 --> 01:28:15.580]  Homeland Security head Chertoff, you got McKaysey over there, and they're saying these Israeli companies, which are Mossad, are going to be running the domestic checkpoints.
[01:28:15.580 --> 01:28:20.301]  I mean, that is just unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:28:20.301 --> 01:28:29.363]  And commanding our local police, the ADL's already done this where they give them all these fake dossiers and demonize every group, and it's just unspeakable.
[01:28:29.363 --> 01:28:33.124]  Let me type coup d'etat into Google with the definition.
[01:28:33.124 --> 01:28:34.525]  Coup d'etat.
[01:28:35.620 --> 01:28:40.921]  Spelling that right.
[01:28:40.921 --> 01:28:46.103]  I am so dumb that I'm not even spelling it right.
[01:28:46.103 --> 01:28:47.143]  Let me try to look it up here.
[01:28:47.143 --> 01:28:48.223]  I probably shouldn't do this on air.
[01:28:48.223 --> 01:28:59.627]  We'll just do that when we come back after the break because I can't seem to think, type, and talk at the same time while I'm on air.
[01:28:59.627 --> 01:29:02.247]  But I'll dig up a good definition of a coup d'etat.
[01:29:02.247 --> 01:29:04.748]  I mean, I basically gave you
[01:29:05.675 --> 01:29:12.797]  The... definition for it.
[01:29:12.797 --> 01:29:14.078]  Ah, I found it.
[01:29:14.078 --> 01:29:26.222]  A coup consists of the infiltration of a small but critical segment of the state apparatus, which is then used to displace the government from its control of the remainder.
[01:29:26.222 --> 01:29:29.143]  There's a coup d'etat going on in the United States.
[01:29:29.143 --> 01:29:32.064]  There's no doubt that a small group
[01:29:32.842 --> 01:29:40.887]  ...has infiltrated a critical segment of the state apparatus, which is then being used to displace the government from its control of the remainder.
[01:29:40.887 --> 01:29:42.288]  We're on the march.
[01:29:42.288 --> 01:29:44.809]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:44.809 --> 01:29:47.491]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:50.643 --> 01:29:56.010]  The Federal Trade Commission estimates that 9 million Americans are victims of identity theft each year.
[01:29:56.010 --> 01:30:02.038]  The crime of identity theft occurs every 3.5 seconds, costing the victims an average of $8,000.
[01:30:02.038 --> 01:30:08.867]  If you own a PC, passwords are a common form of authentication, and often the only protection between a hacker and your personal information.
[01:30:09.187 --> 01:30:18.169]  Passwords that are stored in a spreadsheet, text file, data file, or any other file that is not encrypted and password protected are vulnerable to malicious theft and misuse.

[01:30:51.162 --> 01:30:52.544]  It is a big idea.
[01:30:52.544 --> 01:30:55.406]  A new world order.
[01:30:55.406 --> 01:31:00.290]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:31:00.290 --> 01:31:03.132]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:31:03.132 --> 01:31:05.274]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:31:05.899 --> 01:31:09.081]  For thousands of years, their Dark Order grew.
[01:31:09.081 --> 01:31:16.406]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:31:19.431 --> 01:31:24.875]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:31:24.875 --> 01:31:28.737]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:31:28.737 --> 01:31:31.319]  Bill Burgess is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:31:31.319 --> 01:31:32.480]  Most people have no idea.
[01:31:32.480 --> 01:31:33.260]  They're not after money.
[01:31:33.260 --> 01:31:34.541]  They have all the money they need.
[01:31:34.541 --> 01:31:35.522]  They're after power.
[01:31:35.522 --> 01:31:36.663]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[01:33:37.424 --> 01:33:39.085]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:33:39.085 --> 01:33:40.585]  Welcome to your life.
[01:33:40.585 --> 01:33:42.665]  There's no turning back.
[01:33:42.665 --> 01:33:45.206]  You were born, and you will surely die.
[01:33:45.206 --> 01:33:47.347]  What are you going to build?
[01:33:47.347 --> 01:33:49.747]  What are you going to create?
[01:33:49.747 --> 01:33:52.208]  Are you ever going to find out what really living is all about?
[01:33:52.208 --> 01:33:52.868]  It's not about
[01:33:53.976 --> 01:33:56.758]  Just consuming.
[01:33:56.758 --> 01:33:59.120]  But the establishments told us not to consume.
[01:33:59.120 --> 01:34:03.042]  They're going to control what we can consume, what we can build, what we can say.
[01:34:03.042 --> 01:34:05.304]  They're going to have bureaucrats in our daily lives.
[01:34:05.304 --> 01:34:07.085]  We're going to have to swipe a card to buy and sell.
[01:34:07.085 --> 01:34:12.068]  It will track your entire history of purchases and your quote, carbon footprint.
[01:34:12.068 --> 01:34:19.273]  I read at least eight years ago in Club of Rome documents, UN Biological Diversity Assessments, they would all, we would all have a card.
[01:34:19.273 --> 01:34:20.794]  It would assess our carbon footprint.
[01:34:20.794 --> 01:34:23.136]  It will surveil and track everything we do globally.
[01:34:23.914 --> 01:34:34.159]  Yeah, we will then have to have how many credits we have, and then pay taxes into private global central banks, Federal Reserve, Bank of England, and others.
[01:34:34.159 --> 01:34:37.281]  Just like Federal Express calls itself federal, it's not federal.
[01:34:37.281 --> 01:34:39.162]  And they will run your entire life.
[01:34:39.162 --> 01:34:42.343]  You will have bureaucrats in your home on a weekly basis.
[01:34:42.343 --> 01:34:48.306]  You will have neighborhood captains who are paid a paltry amount by the local government to inspect you.
[01:34:48.306 --> 01:34:53.429]  You will go to jail, not just be fined if the wrong kind of trash is in your rubbish bin.
[01:34:54.407 --> 01:34:55.388]  This is not my opinion.
[01:34:55.388 --> 01:35:00.110]  I told you all this years ago, and now it's all being put in.
[01:35:00.110 --> 01:35:02.491]  It's just, it is hell on earth.
[01:35:02.491 --> 01:35:04.152]  Total control of everything.
[01:35:04.152 --> 01:35:06.493]  Global taxation.
[01:35:06.493 --> 01:35:07.133]  Regulation.
[01:35:07.133 --> 01:35:16.058]  Earlier we played a little clip from BBC, where Austin Williams wrote the book, The Enemies of Progress, The Dangers of Sustainability, and
[01:35:19.773 --> 01:35:28.596]  He was on a program with a guy we've got coming up Monday, who is pushing the global carbon credit and carbon tax, and who they say came up with the idea in 1990.
[01:35:28.596 --> 01:35:30.836]  No, this professor popularized it.
[01:35:30.836 --> 01:35:35.458]  It was in 1964 and 68, Club of Rome documents.
[01:35:35.458 --> 01:35:41.840]  They claimed then, though, that carbon was going to cause ice age, but then they switched and said, well, they said there's a problem.
[01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:44.040]  People are going to figure out that it's normal there's climate change.
[01:35:44.040 --> 01:35:45.621]  So we need to say both.
[01:35:45.621 --> 01:35:48.262]  So whenever it freezes, we say it's the earth and our CO2.
[01:35:49.807 --> 01:35:54.909]  And then whenever it heats up, we can say both and the people don't have a long enough memory.
[01:35:54.909 --> 01:35:55.610]  They say all this.
[01:35:55.610 --> 01:35:57.190]  They admit it's a con job.
[01:35:57.190 --> 01:36:03.813]  Richard N. Haas, the head of the CFR, I've read this several times last month, says it's a way for the state to wage war on the individual.
[01:36:03.813 --> 01:36:06.855]  It is neo-feudalism.
[01:36:06.855 --> 01:36:09.796]  And it is a way to have a monopoly.
[01:36:09.796 --> 01:36:11.396]  And it is hell on earth.
[01:36:11.396 --> 01:36:13.898]  This is the global government.
[01:36:13.898 --> 01:36:19.160]  And here to give us his take on all of that is the Enemies of Progress author Austin Williams.
[01:36:21.172 --> 01:36:28.556]  And of the book, they say, a much-needed diagnosis of the bleak anti-human pathology described as environmentalism.
[01:36:28.556 --> 01:36:36.279]  Dominique Lawson, columnist for the London Independent, a very persuasive contribution by a thoughtful subversive.
[01:36:36.279 --> 01:36:39.341]  That's right, they're talking about arresting people that say this now in Europe.
[01:36:39.341 --> 01:36:46.664]  Professor Frank Ferdy, author of The Politics of Fear and Where Have All the Intellectuals Gone.
[01:36:46.664 --> 01:36:49.786]  Another one here is Austin Williams, is a gift for lobbying well-directed
[01:36:50.621 --> 01:36:56.603]  Uh, grenades, and that's the author of, uh, Immigrants Your Country Needs Them.
[01:36:56.603 --> 01:37:02.245]  Okay, so, uh, we'll go ahead and talk to, uh, the author.
[01:37:02.245 --> 01:37:03.965]  Mr. Williams, thanks for coming on with us.
[01:37:03.965 --> 01:37:04.565]  No problem, Alex.
[01:37:04.565 --> 01:37:05.386]  How are you?
[01:37:05.386 --> 01:37:05.826]  Uh, good.
[01:37:05.826 --> 01:37:08.827]  That little three-minute rant you heard, that's my analysis.
[01:37:08.827 --> 01:37:13.308]  I've made a film about this called Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement with all their admissions.
[01:37:13.308 --> 01:37:15.889]  A, do you agree with what I said, and B, do you want to elaborate on it?
[01:37:16.870 --> 01:37:18.772]  Well, I do and I don't.
[01:37:18.772 --> 01:37:28.083]  I like your style and I like the fact that very few people are critical of this, especially in Europe.
[01:37:28.083 --> 01:37:32.468]  It's really refreshing to hear a rant of that magnitude, so thank you for that.
[01:37:32.888 --> 01:37:33.389]  We're good to go.
[01:37:49.671 --> 01:37:54.876]  In Europe and in parts of Australasia, where people are actually taking this on board.
[01:37:54.876 --> 01:38:04.345]  Now, you don't have to have a camera in your bin to tell you how much rubbish you've thrown out, even though we do in London have cameras in our bins.
[01:38:04.345 --> 01:38:07.869]  The fact is that we now sort of feel guilty.
[01:38:07.869 --> 01:38:09.230]  We have taken this on board.
[01:38:09.230 --> 01:38:11.432]  Sir, that's the grassroots brainwashing.
[01:38:11.432 --> 01:38:13.995]  Let me just ask you, because you're very well informed and I've scanned over your book.
[01:38:14.602 --> 01:38:17.163]  Have you read the Club of Rome documents?
[01:38:17.163 --> 01:38:18.103]  I have, I have.
[01:38:18.103 --> 01:38:23.704]  Okay, so you've read the World Bank IMF discussions and the different policy reports.
[01:38:23.704 --> 01:38:31.725]  They said they would make a new religion, that we needed a religion, and this is the religion of hating ourselves and basically having one-child policy.
[01:38:31.725 --> 01:38:39.727]  So, I agree that the low-level cult members have been brainwashed over 50 years, but at the top, it is the private banks.
[01:38:39.727 --> 01:38:40.967]  They are the ones that engineered it.
[01:38:41.747 --> 01:38:44.890]  Well, I mean, I'm not suggesting that the state has lost all control.
[01:38:44.890 --> 01:38:49.635]  I mean, it's a fairly insidious state of power relations that we have across the world.
[01:38:49.635 --> 01:38:57.904]  So, you know, I agree with you that people do think up all sorts of kind of weird and wonderful and weird and terrible scenarios and then implement them.
[01:38:57.904 --> 01:38:58.905]  That I agree with.
[01:38:58.905 --> 01:39:00.847]  However, all I'm trying to say is I just think that
[01:39:01.387 --> 01:39:02.128]  What's happening?
[01:39:02.128 --> 01:39:05.689]  Take Britain for an example, and it's very, very different to what's going on in America.
[01:39:05.689 --> 01:39:06.490]  I appreciate that.
[01:39:06.490 --> 01:39:15.475]  But generally, there isn't a really heavy-handed, state-intrusive authoritarian policy which actually fines people and locks people up and all the rest of it.
[01:39:16.355 --> 01:39:17.196]  To an outsider.
[01:39:17.196 --> 01:39:18.797]  It looks very hands-off.
[01:39:18.797 --> 01:39:32.969]  But actually, people are regulating themselves because they have bought into, not the fact that they fear being arrested, but more the fact they've bought into this notion that, you know, environmentalism, you know, we're all going to hell in a handcart, that the world's kind of falling apart.
[01:39:32.969 --> 01:39:34.190]  And they are to blame.
[01:39:34.190 --> 01:39:40.636]  This is the thing, you see, I think, whether you want to call that brainwashing from the top, or whether you want to see it as basically accepting of a general
[01:39:41.076 --> 01:39:44.379]  You know, one-track philosophy from the bottom.
[01:39:44.379 --> 01:39:49.423]  I think that people have just bought into this idea that that's all there is, is the Earth.
[01:39:49.423 --> 01:39:59.832]  We are, humans now see themselves as being the problem, which is a fundamental difference to what's ever gone before, where humans have always seen themselves as being creative and solutions to the world.
[01:39:59.832 --> 01:40:07.178]  We now see ourselves as somehow detrimental to the planet, and therefore you then have to rein in what would otherwise have been called creative activity.
[01:40:07.178 --> 01:40:08.899]  Now we see that as being actually detrimental activity.
[01:40:08.919 --> 01:40:16.623]  Yeah, it's a new dark age and the elite are going to build technological spires above us under national security that we're not even aware of.
[01:40:16.623 --> 01:40:17.964]  This is our own statements.
[01:40:17.964 --> 01:40:30.750]  We will live in the suppressed kind of loincloth, you know, going back to nature existence and this is a false template, false programming that they have given us and it comes directly from the elite.
[01:40:30.750 --> 01:40:32.371]  It's been engineered in through the universities.
[01:40:32.951 --> 01:40:50.389]  Well, I mean, again, there's a section in the book which actually looks at the insidious level of educational misinformation and how they are teaching children to be afraid of the future, and therefore they will automatically pester their parents in their profligate ways.
[01:40:50.389 --> 01:40:56.475]  So you have children coming home now, telling parents to turn their television standbys off, to drive more slowly.
[01:40:56.975 --> 01:40:58.356]  Not to buy another car.
[01:40:58.356 --> 01:40:58.817]  You name it.
[01:40:58.817 --> 01:41:02.920]  And that's what Al Gore is doing with his 100 million tattletale squad.
[01:41:02.920 --> 01:41:06.202]  These are going to be the new, they say, the new brigades.
[01:41:06.202 --> 01:41:11.086]  And you have young people all over Austin popping the tires of SUVs, knocking their windows out.
[01:41:11.086 --> 01:41:12.787]  I've seen them do it.
[01:41:12.787 --> 01:41:16.010]  They're running around foaming at the mouth and I'm telling you it's all engineered.
[01:41:16.010 --> 01:41:16.510]  I can prove it.
[01:41:17.665 --> 01:41:21.210]  Well, I'm more than happy to agree.
[01:41:21.210 --> 01:41:24.576]  I mean, I don't mind whether that's the truth on one side of it.
[01:41:24.576 --> 01:41:31.728]  All I'm trying to say is I think that it's a little bit more, for me, the fact that there is no alternative perspective.
[01:41:32.633 --> 01:41:38.496]  I mean, my book is a rant in itself, so I like this kind of presentational style.
[01:41:38.496 --> 01:41:46.560]  But generally, I think that what's missing is a political critique of why it's happening, how it's happening, and really what the alternative position is.
[01:41:46.560 --> 01:41:49.882]  Yeah, we don't have trillions of dollars of funding like the big banks do.
[01:41:49.882 --> 01:41:54.885]  This is a way to tax what we breathe, to tax one of the four inputs of life, carbon dioxide,
[01:41:55.405 --> 01:41:55.605]  Yeah.
[01:41:55.605 --> 01:41:55.985]  Yeah.
[01:41:55.985 --> 01:41:56.226]  Yeah.
[01:42:06.631 --> 01:42:09.132]  Oh yeah, I mean, what did Clubber Roman 74 said it as well?
[01:42:09.132 --> 01:42:14.193]  I mean, they were basically saying we have to find a policy which will unite people.
[01:42:14.193 --> 01:42:18.494]  Because obviously they were very well aware... Yeah, that's Richard Haass saying the people will be the enemy.
[01:42:18.494 --> 01:42:19.514]  No, exactly, exactly.
[01:42:19.514 --> 01:42:27.755]  And so you also have this situation where Malthusianism is coming back, where we now see people as being, as too many people... Eugenics.
[01:42:27.755 --> 01:42:29.196]  Eugenics is everywhere.
[01:42:30.596 --> 01:42:35.041]  Very, very dispiriting but fascinating historical period in which we live in.
[01:42:35.041 --> 01:42:41.108]  And that allows the elite to suppress everything we're going to develop, everything we're going to do, and have total control, a new dark age.
[01:42:41.108 --> 01:42:45.313]  Get into who's driving this, who's behind it, what they're trying to push.
[01:42:45.313 --> 01:42:49.418]  Well, I have to say that my faith in humanity is such that I think that people
[01:42:50.198 --> 01:42:54.060]  The beauty of humanity is that we will not necessarily be kept down.
[01:42:54.060 --> 01:42:56.381]  We will still want more.
[01:42:56.381 --> 01:42:58.502]  We still want better, more convenient things.
[01:42:58.502 --> 01:43:02.303]  We still want improvements in our daily lives, and people are striving for that.
[01:43:02.303 --> 01:43:12.808]  Whether it's the peasants of China going to the special economic zones, or whether it's people in Britain who are actually campaigning against their jobs being lost because of the carbon cuts.
[01:43:13.428 --> 01:43:20.395]  You know, there's a general recognition that people are not there to generally lie down and accept these kinds of things.
[01:43:20.395 --> 01:43:20.776]  That's right.
[01:43:20.776 --> 01:43:26.141]  The farmers and the fishermen are now rioting all over Europe, especially France, over all of this.
[01:43:26.141 --> 01:43:31.046]  Your government's proposing wartime-style rationing.
[01:43:31.046 --> 01:43:34.470]  I mean, describe what's happening in your country and in Europe for people here in the U.S.
[01:43:34.970 --> 01:43:44.454]  Well, I mean, there's that level of political posturing and rhetoric, which is basically any number of politicians now regularly cite the Second World War.
[01:43:44.454 --> 01:43:46.794]  They basically look at two things.
[01:43:46.794 --> 01:43:56.318]  One is historic appeasement, where people gave in to Hitler in the early 30s, and they are then therefore likening anybody who is a climate change, inverted commas, denier
[01:43:57.159 --> 01:43:57.339]  Yes.
[01:44:12.518 --> 01:44:23.026]  Is that people who did fight fascism back in the 30s were fighting, you know, and accepting rationing on the understanding that when they beat the Nazis, life would get better.
[01:44:23.026 --> 01:44:24.307]  There would be more.
[01:44:24.307 --> 01:44:32.873]  But what's being proposed now is that we can have a war economy which is perpetual, which never ends, where we constantly... Which is against ourselves!
[01:44:32.873 --> 01:44:33.994]  Against ourselves, exactly.
[01:44:33.994 --> 01:44:36.916]  Well, we see the thing is that the notion is that we are the problem.
[01:44:37.535 --> 01:44:38.776]  Humanity is the problem.
[01:44:38.776 --> 01:44:40.897]  We have caused this problem.
[01:44:40.897 --> 01:44:44.878]  And I think that is historically never been seen before.
[01:44:44.878 --> 01:44:48.660]  That is the, for me, the ultimate danger of this whole discussion.
[01:44:48.660 --> 01:44:54.863]  To see that, you know, human creativity is now being turned on its head to be seen as human destructiveness.
[01:44:54.863 --> 01:44:59.045]  And that, I mean, I don't think that's got intellectual legs.
[01:44:59.045 --> 01:45:01.125]  I mean, I don't think it'll stand and walk.
[01:45:01.125 --> 01:45:04.207]  But generally, I think that we've got no other
[01:45:10.253 --> 01:45:18.082]  Well, you talk about how it isn't a police state yet, but in Europe they're trying to pass laws and saying that climate change denial should be an arrestable offense.
[01:45:18.082 --> 01:45:19.404]  They're talking about it in England.
[01:45:20.144 --> 01:45:27.927]  We know that I've seen where they are giving people 500 pound fines, 250 pound fines.
[01:45:27.927 --> 01:45:35.190]  That's like $1,000 here in the U.S., ladies and gentlemen, for having the wrong thing in their rubbish bin or too much or putting it out 20 minutes early.
[01:45:35.190 --> 01:45:44.274]  Also, they come to your door and have you sign a pledge that you take responsibility, that you'll be arrested if you do things wrong.
[01:45:44.274 --> 01:45:45.534]  And I've read the documents.
[01:45:45.534 --> 01:45:47.015]  They're going to have neighborhood squads.
[01:45:47.015 --> 01:45:47.735]  It's already happened.
[01:45:48.195 --> 01:45:49.756]  San Francisco's doing it.
[01:45:49.756 --> 01:45:51.477]  Other areas... I mean, this is hell on earth.
[01:46:18.035 --> 01:46:19.496]  Yeah.
[01:46:19.496 --> 01:46:24.619]  No, I mean, there are more than too many mad stories like that.
[01:46:24.619 --> 01:46:26.140]  Well, we already have it in the U.S.
[01:46:26.140 --> 01:46:27.261]  Listen, let me tell you about it.
[01:46:27.261 --> 01:46:27.841]  No, no, I know, I know.
[01:46:27.841 --> 01:46:31.364]  If the wind blows and your bread blows off, you're going to jail.
[01:46:31.364 --> 01:46:31.724]  Okay?
[01:46:31.724 --> 01:46:34.906]  Your child lays their head down in school, they're going to prison.
[01:46:34.906 --> 01:46:36.007]  This is the new system.
[01:46:36.007 --> 01:46:37.888]  I've got all their documents, Mr. Williams.
[01:46:37.888 --> 01:46:40.050]  They are going to mega-rape us.
[01:46:40.050 --> 01:46:40.690]  No, no, no.
[01:46:40.690 --> 01:46:46.494]  I think, I mean, obviously, the Three Strikes Now, which is over here now, is quite an insidious thing.
[01:46:47.114 --> 01:46:48.435]  We've got 31,000 scientists
[01:47:10.602 --> 01:47:26.387]  9,000 of them with PhDs saying that carbon dioxide is good for the earth, that we've had as high as 14 times higher carbon dioxide, that actually it reverses the desert spreading, desertification, and of course that's the real science, and I mean this is big news.
[01:47:27.341 --> 01:47:42.932]  Yeah, well, I mean, it's one of those things, isn't it, that actually, because climate change and global warming, whatever you want to call it, plays a function within a state as a kind of a cohering idea, it's the only remaining ideology left.
[01:47:42.932 --> 01:47:44.834]  It's the one that we, therefore, have to cling to.
[01:47:44.834 --> 01:47:49.617]  I don't mean I do, but generally the way the state and society operates.
[01:47:49.617 --> 01:47:50.718]  No, that's what the elite says.
[01:47:50.718 --> 01:47:51.058]  You're right.
[01:47:51.058 --> 01:47:53.160]  I mean, what we're saying is not our opinion here.
[01:47:53.160 --> 01:47:53.440]  Go ahead.
[01:47:53.960 --> 01:47:56.844]  Yeah, no, sorry, we're in agreement to a large degree here.
[01:47:56.844 --> 01:48:12.203]  I mean, I think that ultimately it is the only game in town, climate change, and therefore to rubbish it, to critique it, to argue against it, is then seen as somehow being sectarian or subversive, and that obviously can't be countenanced.
[01:48:12.543 --> 01:48:17.787]  So I think that there is a bigger kind of a unifying game here being played by the states and by society.
[01:48:17.787 --> 01:48:20.669]  Well, sir, you are very prominent and respected.
[01:48:20.669 --> 01:48:21.789]  You talk to a lot of people.
[01:48:21.789 --> 01:48:24.331]  Let me tell you the game plan, my plan to defeat them.
[01:48:24.331 --> 01:48:25.292]  It's the truth.
[01:48:25.292 --> 01:48:27.853]  The truth is always the ultimate weapon.
[01:48:27.853 --> 01:48:32.857]  There is real environmental degradation with out-of-control, cross-species genetic engineering.
[01:48:33.938 --> 01:48:34.418]  Yeah.
[01:48:34.418 --> 01:48:41.823]  We know that is already causing major problems and already jumping into funguses that are killing most the oak trees in many areas of the country here in the U.S.
[01:48:41.823 --> 01:48:46.327]  We already know there's a lot of serious environmentalism, toxic waste dumping.
[01:48:46.327 --> 01:48:53.252]  We need to demand and show that big corporations have agreed to make it carbon dioxide because they can tax it, get some of the corporate welfare.
[01:48:54.012 --> 01:49:03.640]  And that way everybody's diverted off of a real grassroots environmental movement onto something that isn't a real problem, instead of all the real problems.
[01:49:03.640 --> 01:49:12.728]  And so we need to point out that not only is it a mass hoax, but that it is taking attention away from real environmental crises and things that do need laws.
[01:49:12.728 --> 01:49:15.130]  Now that is how we will crush the enemy.
[01:49:15.130 --> 01:49:19.333]  Because you can't take the religion of the environment away, which has a lot of things that make sense.
[01:49:20.094 --> 01:49:21.035]  We're good.
[01:49:34.068 --> 01:49:47.357]  Yeah, I mean, it's interesting when you say that, because in the Chinese example, there's a big discussion about the desertification of China, obviously due to Mao's terrible environmental and social policies of over 50 years.
[01:49:47.357 --> 01:49:51.640]  But actually, what we forget is that one third of China is desert, and always has been.
[01:49:52.240 --> 01:50:03.369]  And secondly is that the government now, as part of a new environmental strategy, is actually decanting, evicting 11-15,000 people from their villages to plant trees to stop the desert.
[01:50:03.369 --> 01:50:09.093]  So, I mean, if we just take the headline figure of people being evicted,
[01:50:11.435 --> 01:50:12.496]  Uh, isn't it terrible?
[01:50:12.496 --> 01:50:17.841]  Isn't this a kind of sign of the way that, uh, the desertification and the terrible environmental policies are impacting on humanity?
[01:50:17.841 --> 01:50:21.124]  Then actually, uh, you know, you know, it sounds terrible.
[01:50:21.124 --> 01:50:24.607]  But nobody ever says it the other way around, that environmental policies have the same sort of effect.
[01:50:25.954 --> 01:50:27.075]  Stay there, sir.
[01:50:27.075 --> 01:50:28.136]  One more five-minute segment.
[01:50:28.136 --> 01:50:30.799]  Talk about your book, how people get it.
[01:50:30.799 --> 01:50:32.941]  Amazing information, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:50:32.941 --> 01:50:35.564]  Austin Williams, the enemies of progress.
[01:50:35.564 --> 01:50:36.805]  They're not the enemies of progress.
[01:50:36.805 --> 01:50:38.607]  They're the enemies of our progress.
[01:50:38.607 --> 01:50:40.809]  They're gonna control all progress.
[01:50:40.809 --> 01:50:47.696]  Literally, the bureaucrats becoming God with a pack of religious minions running around slicing your tires.
[01:50:47.696 --> 01:50:48.918]  Soon, they'll be police officers.
[01:50:52.222 --> 01:50:58.287]  Did you know the accumulation of acidic waste in the body is the single largest cause of disease such as cancer or diabetes?
[01:50:58.287 --> 01:51:04.232]  Acidic waste is created by the types of food we eat, what we drink, the environment, and our high-stress lifestyles.
[01:51:04.232 --> 01:51:08.395]  It's these choices that cause decreased energy, weight gain, and eventually disease.
[01:51:08.395 --> 01:51:13.299]  The easiest way to reduce disease-causing acidic waste is by drinking alkaline ionized water.
[01:51:13.539 --> 01:51:22.046]  At SnyderHealth.com we offer a full line of alkaline water ionizers from Jupiter Science, the leader in water ionization technology for over 25 years.

[01:54:01.019 --> 01:54:03.060]  I'm not joking.
[01:54:03.060 --> 01:54:06.522]  They've totally brainwashed most of the children in the public government training camps.
[01:54:07.833 --> 01:54:10.556]  When I was in public school, it was all anti-human.
[01:54:10.556 --> 01:54:13.399]  We'd play spaceship, lifeboat, decide who had to die.
[01:54:13.399 --> 01:54:18.805]  They'd say, okay, we gotta have a policeman, gotta have a scientist, gotta have a... Oh, you're a car maker.
[01:54:18.805 --> 01:54:19.485]  Those are bad.
[01:54:19.485 --> 01:54:20.867]  You're gonna die.
[01:54:20.867 --> 01:54:23.910]  So they've had simulated eugenics death drills.
[01:54:23.910 --> 01:54:24.891]  China's the model.
[01:54:24.891 --> 01:54:26.773]  That's going globally.
[01:54:26.773 --> 01:54:28.295]  And it's in all their official documents.
[01:54:28.295 --> 01:54:30.517]  It's in my film, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[01:54:32.404 --> 01:54:33.504]  And they're coming for us.
[01:54:33.504 --> 01:54:44.369]  And, I mean, I was down at Zilker Park a few weeks ago, took off one day, took my kids down to ride the, uh, my children down to ride the train, and I saw several SUVs with their, uh, with their tires slit, windows knocked out.
[01:54:44.369 --> 01:54:48.731]  Uh, one of them had its alarm going off, and I hear about it all the time.
[01:54:48.731 --> 01:54:57.374]  They just run around stabbing tires, bashing in, and a lot of them are gonna become the new EnviroCops, and heaven help you when they get you, because you're a bad human that needs to die.
[01:54:58.488 --> 01:55:03.932]  And, uh, Dr. Eric Bianca, UT, you know, got a standing ovation in the Federation of Scientists.
[01:55:03.932 --> 01:55:08.435]  And, uh, he was broadcast red skulls on the walls and said 90% of us need to be killed.
[01:55:08.435 --> 01:55:14.279]  And there was a three-minute standing ovation with tears in people's eyes, according to eyewitnesses in the newspaper.
[01:55:14.279 --> 01:55:16.981]  So, understand, the vast majority want to start killing immediately.
[01:55:16.981 --> 01:55:21.644]  Uh, and, and, and, I don't know if you want to get that extreme, sir, but I have all the documentation.
[01:55:21.644 --> 01:55:27.468]  Uh, are you aware of the hardcore extinctionist movement?
[01:55:27.468 --> 01:55:28.008]  Mr. Williams?
[01:55:32.162 --> 01:55:33.502]  Yeah, the phone system just blipped.
[01:55:33.502 --> 01:55:34.042]  Okay.
[01:55:34.042 --> 01:55:35.303]  Well, we don't even need him anymore.
[01:55:35.303 --> 01:55:36.003]  Pointless.
[01:55:36.003 --> 01:55:46.626]  The point is, he went on the show, he admitted what was going on, he talked about what was happening, and he understands that it's a giant scam of cult members and that the children come home and boss the parents around.
[01:55:46.626 --> 01:55:50.427]  The state is turning your children against you.
[01:55:50.427 --> 01:55:51.127]  Don't call him back.
[01:55:51.127 --> 01:55:51.547]  It's fine.
[01:55:51.547 --> 01:55:52.247]  I already had him on.
[01:55:52.247 --> 01:55:53.207]  I know 50 times more.
[01:55:53.207 --> 01:55:59.509]  I mean, the whole point here is that... I just wanted to plug him because his book's good.
[01:56:03.015 --> 01:56:05.877]  That they are taking your children from you.
[01:56:05.877 --> 01:56:12.042]  I have seen two different Time magazines for kids that are given out in all public schools in the U.S.
[01:56:12.042 --> 01:56:13.463]  First time I saw it was eight years ago.
[01:56:13.463 --> 01:56:15.425]  About six years ago, I saw another edition.
[01:56:15.425 --> 01:56:17.927]  And it said, your parents don't know the future.
[01:56:17.927 --> 01:56:19.488]  Your parents don't understand.
[01:56:19.488 --> 01:56:21.590]  They're not cool and stylish like you.
[01:56:21.590 --> 01:56:23.812]  They don't want to take microchips.
[01:56:23.812 --> 01:56:26.074]  You understand they're trying to take your kids from you?
[01:56:26.074 --> 01:56:28.756]  You understand they're turning your children against you?
[01:56:28.756 --> 01:56:31.378]  Have you lost all your instincts to be angry with them?
[01:56:32.188 --> 01:56:34.249]  To realize what they've done?
[01:56:34.249 --> 01:56:40.613]  To realize what's going on?
[01:56:40.613 --> 01:56:55.862]  You understand that the human extinctionist movement, the eugenicist movement, all of this is growing and getting more and more powerful and has massive funding and support?
[01:56:55.862 --> 01:56:59.044]  Somehow we've got to activate our humanity.
[01:56:59.044 --> 01:57:01.706]  We've got to realize we're not the enemy, we're the solution.
[01:57:07.455 --> 01:57:08.256]  We've got to do it now.
[01:57:38.106 --> 01:57:42.227]  Against the New World Order.
[01:57:42.227 --> 01:57:46.888]  The money from it won't even go so much as lunch at this office.
[01:57:46.888 --> 01:57:52.009]  Because that's where I want to put my money anyways.
[01:57:52.009 --> 01:57:55.609]  So, InfoWars Money Bomb coming up.
[01:57:55.609 --> 01:58:02.390]  InfoWars Money Bomb coming up in about 10 hours at InfoWars.com.

[01:59:58.020 --> 01:59:58.921]  Well, so does he.
[01:59:58.921 --> 02:00:03.765]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:03.765 --> 02:00:07.848]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.773 --> 02:00:26.574]  Now into hour number three.
[02:00:26.574 --> 02:00:29.974]  Eric Nordstrom joining us in the next segment.
[02:00:29.974 --> 02:00:35.316]  Then I've got a Deputy Air Pollution Control Officer from a major U.S.
[02:00:35.316 --> 02:00:45.539]  city joining us to talk about the new greenhouse gas taxes, the new carbon footprint, the beginning of your enslavement.
[02:00:45.539 --> 02:00:47.899]  So that's coming up in one hour.
[02:00:47.899 --> 02:00:54.101]  I got a lot of news here that I haven't gotten to, but the most incredible story of the day is Reuters' Chertoff.
[02:00:54.745 --> 02:01:01.288]  Israeli-run company to command feds and police with domestic checkpoints.
[02:01:01.288 --> 02:01:04.209]  I mean, it's just... It's just unbelievable.
[02:01:04.209 --> 02:01:06.370]  I mean, he really is Mossad.
[02:01:06.370 --> 02:01:12.153]  Chertoff's mother really is the founder of Mossad.
[02:01:12.153 --> 02:01:17.955]  And I just have a problem with felons, foreigners, illegal aliens being our military, our police.
[02:01:17.955 --> 02:01:23.378]  And it really is true that a lot of leadership positions are being staffed not just with Israelis,
[02:01:24.671 --> 02:01:27.272]  But, and there's no such thing as dual loyalty, folks.
[02:01:27.272 --> 02:01:34.374]  These people work for Israel, they're here to work for Israel, they're allowed to go back to Israel when they commit crimes.
[02:01:34.374 --> 02:01:41.516]  It's like a base camp where nobody else has a place they can run but Israel, and then it's just invincible.
[02:01:41.516 --> 02:01:44.157]  You can do whatever you want, just go back to Israel, and it's just shameful.
[02:01:48.689 --> 02:02:05.380]  Chertoff said they also want to have Homeland Security roving teams in public places, and then you go into the federal plans, it's malls, streets, everywhere, and quote, with Israelis training them how to spot terrorists and how people who look suspicious and off your eye movement and just all this quackery.
[02:02:05.380 --> 02:02:07.681]  And then they claim that gets around the Fourth Amendment.
[02:02:07.681 --> 02:02:14.666]  It's just, look, I'm getting sick of secret police and I'm getting sick of you on American trash.
[02:02:14.666 --> 02:02:16.367]  Just stay away from me, okay?
[02:02:17.881 --> 02:02:22.125]  Your boss is shipping the drugs, they carried out the terror attacks, and I'm tired of it.
[02:02:22.125 --> 02:02:28.210]  I'm tired of your murder, I'm tired of your corruption, your grandstanding about how you're doing this all to keep me safe from terrorism.
[02:02:28.210 --> 02:02:29.391]  Look, I know what you did.
[02:02:29.391 --> 02:02:31.913]  Okay, and I know what the government is.
[02:02:31.913 --> 02:02:38.458]  It's a private group of corporate whores brainwashing the public to now accept global taxes paid directly into the central banks.
[02:02:38.458 --> 02:02:46.384]  I played the BBC, telling you, you're gonna pay your taxes into private banks.
[02:02:46.384 --> 02:02:46.905]  And I'm mad!
[02:02:52.016 --> 02:02:52.336]  U.S.
[02:02:52.336 --> 02:02:59.499]  big cities, big gains against Al-Qaeda.
[02:02:59.499 --> 02:03:00.159]  I misspoke.
[02:03:00.159 --> 02:03:00.479]  U.S.
[02:03:00.479 --> 02:03:03.800]  sites, big gains against Al-Qaeda.
[02:03:03.800 --> 02:03:08.342]  Group is facing setbacks globally, CIA chief says.
[02:03:08.342 --> 02:03:09.662]  This is always the same propaganda.
[02:03:09.662 --> 02:03:14.404]  They say Al-Qaeda's everywhere, Bin Laden's about to strike, there's a new wave of Al-Qaeda.
[02:03:14.404 --> 02:03:19.846]  They're sure to attack with a new president to test our resolve, to energize the new president for police, state, and new wars.
[02:03:20.515 --> 02:03:23.757]  You know, doing exactly what the Arabs don't want, exactly what helps the globalists.
[02:03:23.757 --> 02:03:26.999]  You know, the Al Qaeda always does that.
[02:03:26.999 --> 02:03:29.280]  Motive, means, capability.
[02:03:29.280 --> 02:03:30.601]  It's a globalist.
[02:03:30.601 --> 02:03:33.883]  Been caught red-handed hundreds of times, at least.
[02:03:33.883 --> 02:03:40.787]  And now they're just running around saying, always right after they say they're gonna kill us, they're everywhere, they're unstoppable, they say, oh no, we've made big gains.
[02:03:42.651 --> 02:03:44.471]  So that's basic behavioral psychology.
[02:03:44.471 --> 02:03:46.072]  They come in and say, Oh my God, you're in great danger.
[02:03:46.072 --> 02:03:46.772]  Everything's horrible.
[02:03:46.772 --> 02:03:48.372]  Monsters are going to get you.
[02:03:48.372 --> 02:03:50.793]  It's like meanly walking into your child and saying, there's monsters.
[02:03:50.793 --> 02:03:53.393]  They're going to eat your guts and they're hiding under the bed.
[02:03:53.393 --> 02:03:57.954]  But by hugging me and being good and mommy, daddy's here hug me.
[02:03:57.954 --> 02:03:58.795]  Oh, they don't exist.
[02:03:58.795 --> 02:04:01.435]  Now I'll keep you safe.
[02:04:01.435 --> 02:04:02.455]  The monsters are everywhere.
[02:04:02.455 --> 02:04:03.216]  They're going to get you.
[02:04:03.216 --> 02:04:05.216]  Everything's horrible, but I'll keep you safe from them all.
[02:04:05.216 --> 02:04:05.696]  It's okay.
[02:04:05.696 --> 02:04:06.736]  It's not that bad.
[02:04:06.736 --> 02:04:09.797]  There are monsters, but I ran them away and you knew baby.
[02:04:10.436 --> 02:04:12.317]  First, there's a big monster gonna getcha.
[02:04:12.317 --> 02:04:13.158]  He's getting stronger.
[02:04:13.158 --> 02:04:13.818]  He's coming at you.
[02:04:13.818 --> 02:04:14.479]  He's horrible.
[02:04:14.479 --> 02:04:15.459]  Al-Qaeda's everywhere.
[02:04:15.459 --> 02:04:16.180]  Oh, my gosh.
[02:04:16.180 --> 02:04:17.020]  He's reconfigured.
[02:04:17.020 --> 02:04:17.941]  He's about to nuke us.
[02:04:17.941 --> 02:04:18.661]  It's all over.
[02:04:18.661 --> 02:04:19.582]  Oh, my gosh.
[02:04:19.582 --> 02:04:20.563]  And then, don't worry.
[02:04:20.563 --> 02:04:21.723]  I ran him off, though, for now.
[02:04:21.723 --> 02:04:22.684]  It's not as bad as it was.
[02:04:22.684 --> 02:04:24.005]  Come here.
[02:04:24.005 --> 02:04:25.866]  Come here under those black wings.
[02:04:25.866 --> 02:04:26.927]  Yes.
[02:04:26.927 --> 02:04:28.708]  Oh, don't mind that knife.
[02:04:28.708 --> 02:04:30.589]  I'm sliding into your heart.
[02:04:30.589 --> 02:04:31.770]  Ah, there you go.
[02:04:32.583 --> 02:04:33.464]  That's right.
[02:04:33.464 --> 02:04:34.845]  Never mind those gas prices.
[02:04:34.845 --> 02:04:37.526]  Never mind your name being destroyed as an American.
[02:04:37.526 --> 02:04:39.708]  We used your name for ourselves.
[02:04:39.708 --> 02:04:43.991]  Oh, yes!
[02:04:43.991 --> 02:04:45.892]  You're bleeding to death now.
[02:04:45.892 --> 02:04:46.733]  It won't be long.
[02:04:47.617 --> 02:05:00.775]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[02:05:00.775 --> 02:05:04.601]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation.
[02:05:04.941 --> 02:05:11.822]  In which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[02:05:11.822 --> 02:05:15.223]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[02:05:15.223 --> 02:05:23.125]  From hijackers being trained at US military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[02:06:51.514 --> 02:06:56.619]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:06:56.619 --> 02:06:58.120]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:06:58.120 --> 02:07:01.564]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calabin Pure Soaps?

[02:07:48.055 --> 02:07:50.817]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:07:50.817 --> 02:07:53.639]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:24.566 --> 02:08:33.092]  All right, let's go ahead now for about a five-minute update and talk to the guy that originally started the Ron Paul Money Bomb.
[02:08:33.092 --> 02:08:33.953]  He's Eric Nordstrom.
[02:08:33.953 --> 02:08:37.296]  He's got the website InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com.
[02:08:37.296 --> 02:08:41.719]  There's links to that where you can actually get on PayPal or where you can give via
[02:08:43.246 --> 02:08:47.289]  Credit card or there's a toll-free number going up there in the next hour or so.
[02:08:47.289 --> 02:08:47.889]  May already be up there.
[02:08:47.889 --> 02:08:49.671]  I haven't looked in about an hour.
[02:08:49.671 --> 02:09:00.978]  And we can call starting tonight at midnight going into Saturday morning, Saturday afternoon, Saturday evening until midnight Saturday going into Sunday morning.
[02:09:00.978 --> 02:09:07.363]  And we really appreciate everybody and it's going to be exciting and we're going to use it for equipment, cameras, a better office.
[02:09:09.038 --> 02:09:10.399]  Frankly, things are so expensive.
[02:09:10.399 --> 02:09:13.782]  I mean, we're not a huge operation, but we're already spending more than $100,000 a month.
[02:09:13.782 --> 02:09:16.565]  We'll affect well over that.
[02:09:16.565 --> 02:09:17.926]  Yeah, that's how much money's coming in.
[02:09:17.926 --> 02:09:20.168]  It's going right back into the operation.
[02:09:20.168 --> 02:09:24.251]  That's why other people can't get stuff off the ground and can't do it, because money comes in, they gotta hold on to it.
[02:09:24.251 --> 02:09:26.934]  Because they worship the birdcage liner.
[02:09:26.934 --> 02:09:28.175]  I don't.
[02:09:28.175 --> 02:09:32.599]  And I need your help, ladies and gentlemen, going to the next level and expanding.
[02:09:34.113 --> 02:09:36.835]  And also, it reaffirms the idea of the money bomb.
[02:09:36.835 --> 02:09:38.256]  Eric, your take on what's going on?
[02:09:38.256 --> 02:09:39.437]  I had a lot more pledges.
[02:09:39.437 --> 02:09:41.058]  People are getting excited.
[02:09:41.058 --> 02:09:45.041]  And we're right up there at $80,000 now pledged, and I think it's going to be even a lot bigger than that.
[02:09:45.041 --> 02:09:46.282]  I certainly hope it is, Eric.
[02:09:46.282 --> 02:09:49.264]  Yeah, over the last few days, I've got a good feeling.
[02:09:49.264 --> 02:09:53.047]  You know, you go into these things, and as long as you feel like $1 is more than zero, you're in there.
[02:09:56.893 --> 02:10:08.401]  But yeah, I mean, we'd love to have the money, we'd love to, you know, I'd like to see your show on Cable Dish Network, and the whole idea is you gotta get inspired, you gotta, you know, put a product out, and I'd like to see this.
[02:10:08.401 --> 02:10:09.422]  This is an investment.
[02:10:09.422 --> 02:10:11.563]  I consider this an investment.
[02:10:11.563 --> 02:10:18.788]  The money that I put in, the time that I put in, this is an investment in the future because we are, you know, we are fighting the information war.
[02:10:18.788 --> 02:10:21.370]  I put a couple videos on the website,
[02:10:22.333 --> 02:10:23.774]  I put one up there specifically.
[02:10:23.774 --> 02:10:30.857]  It's actually the, I think it was like the fourth video on the way down and that's the kind of thing we're running into.
[02:10:30.857 --> 02:10:36.500]  You got a lot of people out there that just think that, you know, any information other than what the
[02:10:37.788 --> 02:10:43.331]  The normal, you know, run-of-the-mill Fox story is just total kooky.
[02:10:43.331 --> 02:10:45.492]  Well, you know, here's the deal, Eric.
[02:10:45.492 --> 02:10:51.114]  I just ignore the naysayers and I move forward because they're not going to wake up.
[02:10:51.114 --> 02:10:53.996]  They're invested in the lie, and this is done psychologically.
[02:10:53.996 --> 02:10:56.076]  The Globalist Right policy reports on this.
[02:10:56.076 --> 02:11:03.320]  When they came out and said, torture children sexually in front of their parents in White House memos, ordering the military to do that,
[02:11:03.860 --> 02:11:07.785]  That was the lowest pit of hell you can get sexually torturing children.
[02:11:07.785 --> 02:11:10.549]  I guess, other than killing them, which they also do in some cases.
[02:11:10.549 --> 02:11:21.503]  And so, once people defended the torture, they had made a deal with Satan, a deal with the devil, a deal with Jeffrey Dahmer, a deal with Ted Bundy, with John Wayne Gacy, a deal with hell.
[02:11:22.435 --> 02:11:25.296]  And then, they have to defend no matter what happens.
[02:11:25.296 --> 02:11:28.758]  And they call that the cement of blood.
[02:11:28.758 --> 02:11:32.059]  And they know exactly what they're doing.
[02:11:32.059 --> 02:11:36.461]  They understand what they are doing.
[02:11:36.461 --> 02:11:44.304]  And so, once they get you to commit... I mean, look, I get emails every day saying oil prices aren't up, and there's no inflation, and I'm a dirty liar.
[02:11:44.304 --> 02:11:47.845]  And that there's no new world order, as they announce it all over television.
[02:11:47.845 --> 02:11:51.447]  So, you know, there's gonna be a group of people who have wed themselves to evil,
[02:11:52.398 --> 02:11:57.005]  They think they're good guys, and they are never... I mean, that's why Nazis would do more and more evil.
[02:11:57.005 --> 02:11:58.968]  That's why the Soviets would do more and more evil.
[02:11:58.968 --> 02:12:06.299]  Because they... once they have done... once somebody's attacked me and said I'm a liar or I'm this or I'm that, they can never go back.
[02:12:07.120 --> 02:12:17.424]  Most of them don't have the moral courage to admit they were wrong, so they're always going to attack me and just add more lies onto what they claim about me or Ron Paul or somebody else, because they can't ever admit they were wrong.
[02:12:17.424 --> 02:12:19.265]  Me, I will admit I'm wrong.
[02:12:19.265 --> 02:12:25.527]  Me, I will admit when I've done something, and I'm not saying I'm some great person, but, you know, I want to have integrity.
[02:12:25.527 --> 02:12:29.189]  But, Eric, again, other issues about the money bomb.
[02:12:31.050 --> 02:12:34.353]  Well, it certainly is a matter of perspective.
[02:12:34.353 --> 02:12:43.281]  I'm always having to correct people in as far as the value of the dollar is actually going down, whereas they think the gas prices and whatnot are going up.
[02:12:43.281 --> 02:12:45.483]  And so, again, it's a matter of perspective.
[02:12:46.576 --> 02:12:48.977]  And that goes along with the same with the money bomb.
[02:12:48.977 --> 02:12:55.038]  You know, you can't sit there and think the money bomb is an exclusively political thing.
[02:12:55.038 --> 02:13:05.521]  Or even if you do think it's a political thing for candidates, I can't think of a better way for helping all candidates, you know, no matter what party, of the constitutional nature.
[02:13:05.521 --> 02:13:14.064]  You know, to be able to be on Dish Network, to be able to be hosted by Alex Jones and on videos, I think a lot of the
[02:13:14.907 --> 02:13:18.351]  Well, Eric, let me break it down for people to be specific.
[02:13:18.351 --> 02:13:26.138]  I was already planning, and I got the lease, I gotta finish up with the lawyer and sign it to move into a bigger office because we're stacked up on top of each other.
[02:13:38.827 --> 02:13:42.748]  And I am going to do at least once a week this network show.
[02:13:42.748 --> 02:13:44.609]  That's all I have the money for.
[02:13:44.609 --> 02:13:49.910]  Maybe, if I was able to get sponsors, move it to once a day or five days a week.
[02:13:49.910 --> 02:13:53.511]  But if we had a million dollars come in, we would for about...
[02:13:55.832 --> 02:13:56.873]  We're good to go.
[02:14:16.234 --> 02:14:21.938]  Dozens of shows now and tens of millions a day tune in, and then it gets magnified on the internet.
[02:14:21.938 --> 02:14:26.741]  The problem is they're putting out somewhat of an anti-establishment, but with a leftward angle.
[02:14:26.741 --> 02:14:31.844]  It's certainly better than Fox and CNN, but it's still anti-gun and a few other things I don't like.
[02:14:31.844 --> 02:14:34.406]  I know Willie doesn't like it, but he still overall supports it.
[02:14:34.406 --> 02:14:36.567]  And so, I mean, I will do this.
[02:14:36.567 --> 02:14:38.348]  This is a lot of work I'm stepping into.
[02:14:38.348 --> 02:14:40.810]  This is a big commitment.
[02:14:41.545 --> 02:14:47.388]  But yeah, if $100,000 comes in, that'll just let me get a once a week, twice a week, three times a week show up quicker.
[02:14:47.388 --> 02:14:50.190]  That'll let us have better computers, a few more staff.
[02:14:50.190 --> 02:14:54.572]  I mean, because $100,000, that hires two or three people with decent living and then maybe a few computers.
[02:14:54.572 --> 02:14:57.914]  I mean, it takes a lot of money to do this, folks.
[02:14:57.914 --> 02:14:59.375]  And that's one reason I've been effective.
[02:14:59.375 --> 02:15:00.015]  I'll say it again.
[02:15:00.015 --> 02:15:07.059]  Because money comes in here and it goes right back into equipment and personnel and we just don't bring in enough to go to the next level.
[02:15:07.059 --> 02:15:09.040]  And so, instead of crawling, we can run
[02:15:09.941 --> 02:15:13.905]  If people will go viral with this and donate a million dollars.
[02:15:13.905 --> 02:15:18.469]  Now a million dollars is what $100,000 was 15-20 years ago.
[02:15:18.469 --> 02:15:21.892]  So understand we're really asking for $100,000 in Federal Reserve notes.
[02:15:21.892 --> 02:15:27.978]  And in a year it'll probably be, you know, $100,000 will be, you know, the equivalent of, you know, $20,000.
[02:15:27.978 --> 02:15:30.060]  I mean it's just evaporating.
[02:15:30.060 --> 02:15:31.261]  So you're also taking something
[02:15:31.881 --> 02:15:32.321]  Yes, you do.
[02:15:32.321 --> 02:15:33.922]  You know, and you've got a lot of good allies out there.
[02:15:33.922 --> 02:15:35.082]  You know, between G. Edgar Griffin at the
[02:16:01.920 --> 02:16:05.322]  Freedom Force International, you know, and others.
[02:16:05.322 --> 02:16:09.845]  You've got so much content that we could be putting on television 24-7.
[02:16:09.845 --> 02:16:12.747]  And I always look at it as, you know, you've got to shoot for the stars.
[02:16:12.747 --> 02:16:14.408]  You've got to go for the highest level.
[02:16:14.408 --> 02:16:17.450]  If you hit the moon, that's fantastic.
[02:16:17.450 --> 02:16:19.451]  But we've got to get off the ground in any case.
[02:16:19.451 --> 02:16:22.093]  And so I'm hoping that, you know, let's do this.
[02:16:22.093 --> 02:16:22.593]  Let's do this.
[02:16:24.580 --> 02:16:39.727]  Well, there's no doubt that a better produced TV program, and I'm pretty good on TV, and then guests and other things, and I'd even hook it up where you can pretty inexpensively, comparatively, have other people that even tape their shows once a week and then send them in to us.
[02:16:39.727 --> 02:16:42.689]  Or we had the money, the fiber optic connection, where they'd upload it to us.
[02:16:43.649 --> 02:16:50.174]  There's a lot of new technologies that, I mean, just five years ago, it would take $10 million to start a network.
[02:16:50.174 --> 02:16:52.776]  Now it only costs a few million to do it.
[02:16:52.776 --> 02:16:55.278]  And again, ladies and gentlemen, I do everything I say I'm going to do.
[02:16:55.278 --> 02:16:57.240]  So it's literally in your hands.
[02:16:57.240 --> 02:16:59.662]  It is up to you what happens with this money bomb.
[02:16:59.662 --> 02:17:04.826]  If this money bomb is successful, maybe we'll have a money bomb once a year or something, or a fundraising week.
[02:17:04.826 --> 02:17:05.786]  I don't like doing this.
[02:17:05.786 --> 02:17:07.928]  I'd rather you support our Aminathem affiliates.
[02:17:07.928 --> 02:17:09.029]  I'd rather have sponsors.
[02:17:09.709 --> 02:17:12.571]  Uh, and things, but it just doesn't bring in the capital.
[02:17:12.571 --> 02:17:17.134]  We need to be able to properly do this, and I need more fuel.
[02:17:17.134 --> 02:17:26.621]  I mean, if I want to take off in my B-52, my Infowars B-52, fly over the New World Order capital in the Infowar, and blow the daylights out of them, I need the fuel.
[02:17:26.621 --> 02:17:28.021]  I've got the bombs.
[02:17:28.021 --> 02:17:32.605]  But I just need to get over the enemy and drop weapons on them, and we're gonna do that.
[02:17:32.605 --> 02:17:33.525]  And so it's up to you.
[02:17:33.525 --> 02:17:34.966]  You've got the ball, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:17:34.966 --> 02:17:36.227]  We need the Infowars money bomb.
[02:17:36.227 --> 02:17:38.689]  It starts in about 10 hours at Infowars.com.
[02:17:39.849 --> 02:17:42.970]  To launch, we're going to have people here at midnight to take your phone calls.
[02:17:42.970 --> 02:17:43.870]  We're going to order that way.
[02:17:43.870 --> 02:17:51.373]  And by order, we're going to do a thing where if you even want to do it over the shopping cart, you can get a free Citizen Rule book for gifts or things like that.
[02:17:51.373 --> 02:17:56.074]  Or if you want to call in and donate, whatever, tonight, midnight, Central Standard Time.
[02:17:56.654 --> 02:18:03.535]  And I just want to thank you for having the idea to do this, and I know you'll be on the show with me tomorrow from 8 to midnight, popping in.
[02:18:03.535 --> 02:18:10.057]  As we track all of this, we'll also have a graph we're going to be giving you in the next few hours, so we can update the numbers as they come in.
[02:18:10.057 --> 02:18:15.898]  That graph will also be in InfoWars, but also InfoWarsMoneybomb.com, so people can see their donations as they build up.
[02:18:15.898 --> 02:18:19.358]  And I really appreciate you coming on the show, Eric Nordstrom.
[02:18:19.358 --> 02:18:20.459]  That's fantastic, sir.
[02:18:22.955 --> 02:18:27.438]  Pledge now with a few dollars, pay now with a few dollars, or pay later with your liberty.
[02:18:27.438 --> 02:18:27.758]  Absolutely.
[02:18:27.758 --> 02:18:28.579]  Let me talk to you in the break.
[02:18:28.579 --> 02:18:29.519]  We're going to break in about a minute.
[02:18:29.519 --> 02:18:30.840]  I want to tell you something.
[02:18:30.840 --> 02:18:33.562]  Okay, I'm going to come back, cover some news.
[02:18:33.562 --> 02:18:36.523]  And man, there is so much of it.
[02:18:36.523 --> 02:18:39.585]  In-flight surveillance could foil terrorists in the sky.
[02:18:39.585 --> 02:18:40.426]  New Scientist.
[02:18:40.985 --> 02:18:45.448]  Companies to put in-camera, in-seat cameras to watch your faces.
[02:18:45.448 --> 02:18:50.971]  The artificial intelligence computer system will decide if you're planning a terror attack off your facial expression.
[02:18:50.971 --> 02:18:52.952]  See, now an excuse to swat you.
[02:18:52.952 --> 02:18:54.993]  Now an excuse to taser with the air marshal.
[02:18:54.993 --> 02:19:00.497]  Now an excuse to put you on a list because you had gas and made a frown.
[02:19:00.497 --> 02:19:00.957]  You see?
[02:19:00.957 --> 02:19:02.538]  And then it's all quackery.
[02:19:02.538 --> 02:19:03.278]  Eight million of you.
[02:19:03.278 --> 02:19:03.899]  It was a million.
[02:19:03.899 --> 02:19:06.100]  Now we learned it's eight million on the terror list.
[02:19:06.100 --> 02:19:07.861]  You'll all be terrorists before they're done.
[02:19:09.159 --> 02:19:10.820]  Eight million Al Qaeda's in America.
[02:19:10.820 --> 02:19:11.941]  Total bull.
[02:19:11.941 --> 02:19:13.362]  There's not one real Al Qaeda.
[02:19:13.362 --> 02:19:14.543]  It's CIA.
[02:19:14.543 --> 02:19:16.624]  Shame on these murderers.
[02:19:16.624 --> 02:19:18.745]  Senate to push carbon tax enslavement bill.
[02:19:18.745 --> 02:19:20.266]  We'll cover this when we get back.
[02:19:20.266 --> 02:19:20.727]  That's right.
[02:19:20.727 --> 02:19:20.867]  U.S.
[02:19:20.867 --> 02:19:24.629]  Senate moving to give you your enslavement.
[02:19:24.629 --> 02:19:29.352]  And they will phase it in within the next few years on all of your energy costs.
[02:19:29.352 --> 02:19:32.934]  Gasoline, power, light bulbs.
[02:19:32.934 --> 02:19:35.296]  But then they're going to bring it in with a card.
[02:19:35.296 --> 02:19:36.997]  And you'll swipe that.
[02:19:36.997 --> 02:19:38.458]  It will hold your creds.
[02:19:39.105 --> 02:19:47.390]  And then when you're out of creds, and it's designed where you have about half the creds you need to live, you will pay the Federal Reserve taxes.
[02:19:47.390 --> 02:19:49.351]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[02:19:49.351 --> 02:19:52.973]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[02:19:52.973 --> 02:19:55.314]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[02:19:55.314 --> 02:19:58.456]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[02:19:58.456 --> 02:20:04.200]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[02:20:04.200 --> 02:20:08.122]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[02:20:08.442 --> 02:20:13.624]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[02:20:13.624 --> 02:20:16.685]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.

[02:20:41.603 --> 02:20:43.747]  Put them on the file sharing networks.
[02:20:43.747 --> 02:20:45.530]  Bring down the New World Order.
[02:20:45.530 --> 02:20:46.272]  PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:20:47.307 --> 02:20:48.528]  Hi, Ted Anders from Midas.
[02:20:48.528 --> 02:20:50.050]  May 29, 2008.
[02:20:50.050 --> 02:20:51.110]  Gold, $8.91.
[02:20:51.110 --> 02:20:57.036]  Hans Gold coins can be purchased for $9.17.90, $4.52.15 for half, $2.26.08 for quarter.
[02:20:57.036 --> 02:21:01.560]  That's $9.17.90, $4.52.15, and $2.26.08.
[02:21:01.560 --> 02:21:05.143]  For years, Ron Paul has taken the position to uphold constitutional rights.
[02:21:05.143 --> 02:21:09.727]  He's been branded by special interest groups as Dr. No, refusing to bend his values.
[02:21:09.727 --> 02:21:13.691]  I can only imagine the pressure applied by Congress as he stands alone for these principles.
[02:21:14.071 --> 02:21:16.391]  He has given up a medical career for this.
[02:21:16.391 --> 02:21:18.372]  Ron Paul is running for president.
[02:21:18.372 --> 02:21:24.633]  The ideas of strong currency, ending the war, defending the Constitution, and protecting civil liberties are catching on.
[02:21:24.633 --> 02:21:31.755]  As a thank you, GCNlive.com, Midas Resources, and I would like to send you a free copy of the Ron Paul Family Cookbook.
[02:21:31.755 --> 02:21:32.635]  Call 800-686-2237 for your free copy.
[02:21:32.635 --> 02:21:32.955]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[02:21:39.088 --> 02:21:42.311]  I hope his values are touching your heart as deep as they are mine.
[02:21:42.311 --> 02:21:42.692]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:21:42.692 --> 02:21:44.293]  Thanks again for supporting Ron Paul.
[02:21:47.910 --> 02:21:51.113]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:21:51.113 --> 02:22:01.763]  Did you know that modern technology has devised a barcode that fits inside a tiny microchip that can be placed under the skin of dogs and children to track them everywhere they go?
[02:22:01.763 --> 02:22:11.272]  Did you know they're now working on a chip to place under the skin of human beings that'll let you buy and sell in a global economy without cash, coins, and checks?
[02:22:12.313 --> 02:22:18.596]  It's the coming 666 system called the Mark of the Beast in Revelation chapter 13.
[02:22:18.596 --> 02:22:26.999]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[02:22:26.999 --> 02:22:28.940]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[02:22:28.940 --> 02:22:29.280]  That's 1-800-516-8736.

[02:22:47.284 --> 02:22:52.828]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[02:22:52.828 --> 02:22:57.831]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for the American empire instead of what's fair for the American people.
[02:22:57.831 --> 02:23:04.016]  The only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism, which is why you should be reading the Nationalist Times each month.

[02:24:24.693 --> 02:24:26.794]  Why do you think we're a leader in power?
[02:24:26.794 --> 02:24:27.515]  They're smart.
[02:24:27.515 --> 02:24:28.276]  They're cunning.
[02:24:28.276 --> 02:24:29.016]  They're slick.
[02:24:29.016 --> 02:24:30.437]  They're con artists.
[02:24:30.437 --> 02:24:32.599]  They know how to manipulate you.
[02:24:32.599 --> 02:24:38.523]  They convinced you that you were the big boss.
[02:24:38.523 --> 02:24:40.224]  That you weren't being manipulated.
[02:24:40.224 --> 02:24:41.405]  That you weren't being conned.
[02:24:41.405 --> 02:24:42.465]  That there wasn't an elite.
[02:24:42.465 --> 02:24:44.667]  That corrupt elites don't exist.
[02:24:44.667 --> 02:24:50.451]  That was like existing you but there aren't... That was like convincing you there weren't fish in the sea or a sun in the sky.
[02:24:51.508 --> 02:24:54.090]  Or birds in the trees or grass on the ground.
[02:24:54.090 --> 02:25:00.594]  I mean, they convinced you to just trust and mindlessly tune out of reality.
[02:25:00.594 --> 02:25:10.600]  Like the world's just some wonderland where you just run around happily giggling and snickering to yourself like a mindless weed head.
[02:25:10.600 --> 02:25:13.702]  Meanwhile, evil grew.
[02:25:13.702 --> 02:25:14.783]  Meanwhile, evil grew.
[02:25:16.047 --> 02:25:18.428]  And I'm just a good ol' boy that isn't stupid.
[02:25:18.428 --> 02:25:20.929]  And I can read their own documents, and it freaks me out.
[02:25:20.929 --> 02:25:26.092]  And I am sitting here screaming and yelling that we're under attack, that we're under bombardment.
[02:25:26.092 --> 02:25:31.234]  Trying everything I can to get you to see the big picture and realize what we're doing.
[02:25:31.234 --> 02:25:34.416]  As a society, where we're going.
[02:25:34.416 --> 02:25:37.477]  And trying to get you to be an active participant in your own life.
[02:25:37.477 --> 02:25:39.558]  Trying to get you to engage with reality.
[02:25:39.558 --> 02:25:40.159]  I mean, look at this.
[02:25:40.159 --> 02:25:43.100]  Lee Rogers did a great report on this up on Infowars.com from Rogue Government.
[02:25:43.817 --> 02:25:45.919]  Senate to push carbon tax enslavement bill.
[02:25:45.919 --> 02:25:51.503]  The establishment is getting ready to push forward with Joe Lieberman's proposed carbon credit enslavement bill.
[02:25:51.503 --> 02:25:55.046]  The bill, otherwise known as American Climate Security Act.
[02:25:55.046 --> 02:25:57.128]  Oh, it's all for security.
[02:25:57.128 --> 02:26:03.753]  Just like Homeland Security and Patriot Act of 2007 or S-2191 has been reintroduced.
[02:26:03.753 --> 02:26:09.318]  Will give the Environmental Protection Agency draconian powers to implement a carbon credit system here in the United States.
[02:26:09.318 --> 02:26:10.679]  A new tax system over everything.
[02:26:11.835 --> 02:26:14.016]  Read the full analysis of the bill here.
[02:26:14.016 --> 02:26:23.420]  This is nothing more than a carbonate tax, and the bill intends to reduce the amount of available carbon credits on a year-to-year basis starting in the year 2012.
[02:26:23.420 --> 02:26:29.563]  Now again, that means phasing it into everything.
[02:26:29.563 --> 02:26:39.987]  This will effectively make it more difficult for small and medium-sized businesses to compete with the large multinational corporations who have had the resources to deal with the ridiculous environmental enslavement tax.
[02:26:40.822 --> 02:26:45.223]  The threat of man-made carbon emissions causing global warming is a documented fraud.
[02:26:45.223 --> 02:26:52.225]  Over 31,000 scientists have recently come forward refuting the claims of Al Gore and others who are promoting this lie.
[02:26:52.225 --> 02:27:02.868]  The fact that the corporate-controlled media can continue to provide and promote this huge lie as a propaganda to pass the carbon credit initiative is utterly insane.
[02:27:02.868 --> 02:27:08.549]  According to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, debate is scheduled to begin on this legislation next week or the beginning of June.
[02:27:09.440 --> 02:27:18.608]  For years, the Senate Committee on Environmental and Public Works was a burial ground for legislation addressing, among other things, coal-powered electricity generation.
[02:27:18.608 --> 02:27:18.988]  The U.S.
[02:27:18.988 --> 02:27:24.132]  has about a quarter of the world's known supply of coal, and coal is a primary source of electricity in this country.
[02:27:24.132 --> 02:27:28.195]  Hydroelectric power is not as prominent elsewhere in the region.
[02:27:28.195 --> 02:27:28.796]  They call the U.S.
[02:27:28.796 --> 02:27:30.017]  a region in the Senate.
[02:27:30.017 --> 02:27:37.223]  This is commonly said that reducing the emissions of coal used to generate electricity is vital to controlling greenhouse gas emissions here.
[02:27:37.936 --> 02:27:41.957]  Most seem to believe that this is a cornerstone to any effective policy.
[02:27:41.957 --> 02:27:47.159]  In December, the committee with the Democratic majority passed America's Climate Security Act of 2007.
[02:27:47.159 --> 02:27:50.740]  The bill will be debated in the Senate next week.
[02:27:50.740 --> 02:27:52.380]  The Republicans are split on this bill.
[02:27:52.380 --> 02:27:56.882]  Larry Craig and other Republicans did all they could to prevent the bill from getting out of conference.
[02:27:56.882 --> 02:28:00.843]  The bill, though, is sponsored by Joe Lieberman and John Warner.
[02:28:00.843 --> 02:28:01.783]  Warner is on the committee.
[02:28:02.665 --> 02:28:04.006]  And they act like Republicans.
[02:28:04.006 --> 02:28:08.329]  Oh, I accidentally burned down the restaurant when we were in debt.
[02:28:08.329 --> 02:28:14.833]  I accidentally lightning struck.
[02:28:14.833 --> 02:28:16.014]  Oh, they're so conservative.
[02:28:16.014 --> 02:28:22.158]  Even though there's absolutely no difference between the Republicans and the Democrats, it's pretty clear the establishment is hell-bent on pushing the thing through.
[02:28:22.158 --> 02:28:24.199]  The majority of Democrats are going to support the bill.
[02:28:24.199 --> 02:28:27.582]  And if they don't pass it this year, they've got Valhalla coming.
[02:28:27.582 --> 02:28:29.103]  Barack Obama or Hillary.
[02:28:29.103 --> 02:28:29.983]  It looks like they're going to win.
[02:28:29.983 --> 02:28:30.584]  It could be McCain.
[02:28:30.584 --> 02:28:30.924]  Who knows?
[02:28:32.270 --> 02:28:35.971]  And then they'll control the House and the Senate, and it's all going to continue.
[02:28:35.971 --> 02:28:40.312]  The wars, taxes, gun control, amnesty.
[02:28:40.312 --> 02:28:44.514]  Because you look at the establishment, they're all together.
[02:28:44.514 --> 02:28:55.797]  You look at these people, and they agree on every single issue right down the line.
[02:28:55.797 --> 02:29:00.338]  Open borders, gun control, carbon taxes, the Iraq war.
[02:29:00.338 --> 02:29:02.079]  The parties are all for it.
[02:29:04.304 --> 02:29:07.026]  The parties are all for it.
[02:29:07.026 --> 02:29:10.369]  Because the parties are bought and paid for by the same people.
[02:29:10.369 --> 02:29:16.393]  And let me give all the establishment folks out there who think they're members of the establishment a newsflash.
[02:29:16.393 --> 02:29:23.138]  Seven trillion has been spent or disappeared out of the Pentagon in the last six and a half years.
[02:29:23.138 --> 02:29:26.441]  Seven trillion.
[02:29:26.441 --> 02:29:30.464]  You understand the biggest robbery in history.
[02:29:30.464 --> 02:29:32.886]  That's why you've been militarized and told we're the enemy.
[02:29:33.931 --> 02:29:37.654]  Because you're now to bring us to the next level.
[02:29:37.654 --> 02:29:39.035]  We're on the march.
[02:29:39.035 --> 02:29:41.576]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:41.576 --> 02:29:44.258]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:47.543 --> 02:29:53.387]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH-balanced alkaline environment.
[02:29:53.387 --> 02:29:58.810]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[02:29:58.810 --> 02:30:04.194]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention of disease.
[02:30:04.194 --> 02:30:10.097]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity, and loss of weight.
[02:30:10.097 --> 02:30:14.360]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water, but due to modern way of life,
[02:30:14.560 --> 02:30:16.301]  Most people are overly acidic.
[02:30:16.301 --> 02:30:20.104]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[02:30:20.104 --> 02:30:24.928]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[02:30:24.928 --> 02:30:25.968]  Do your part.
[02:30:25.968 --> 02:30:28.590]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now!
[02:30:28.590 --> 02:30:34.715]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate that raises the pH of the water you drink

[02:30:47.157 --> 02:31:00.279]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[02:31:00.279 --> 02:31:04.120]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation.
[02:31:04.460 --> 02:31:11.342]  In which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[02:31:11.342 --> 02:31:14.762]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[02:31:14.762 --> 02:31:16.523]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.
[02:31:16.523 --> 02:31:22.644]  military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[02:31:38.292 --> 02:31:40.934]  We're in a no-holds-bar information war.
[02:31:40.934 --> 02:31:46.738]  Truth is our weapon, and PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[02:31:46.738 --> 02:31:49.260]  Hi, this is Dave from Ready Reserve Foods.
[02:31:49.260 --> 02:31:55.584]  I have been waiting patiently for the government and mainstream media to inform you of what is turning out to be the biggest problem facing the world in the last 50 years.
[02:31:56.605 --> 02:32:02.212]  For the last three years, the Earth has consumed more food than it has been able to produce, and it has now finally caught up with this.
[02:32:02.212 --> 02:32:09.140]  In the U.S., commodities such as flour and rice are already being rationed, and the next rice crop won't be available for another four to five months.
[02:32:09.140 --> 02:32:15.767]  It's fall in the Southern Hemisphere, and many countries are short the food necessary to make it through the winter, and have stopped exporting certain commodities altogether.
[02:32:16.553 --> 02:32:18.133]  Remember our trade deficit?
[02:32:18.133 --> 02:32:23.995]  Trillions of dollars have stacked up outside the country and are now rushing in to buy our food production at any price.
[02:32:23.995 --> 02:32:30.376]  By late summer, if not early fall, it is likely our government will step in and control food and food exports under martial law.
[02:32:30.376 --> 02:32:31.856]  Call Ready Reserve Foods at 1-800-453-2202.
[02:32:31.856 --> 02:32:31.936]  1-800-453-2202.
[02:32:31.936 --> 02:32:33.136]  Or visit us at www.readyreservefoods.com.
[02:32:33.136 --> 02:32:33.196]  1-800-453-2202.
[02:32:58.018 --> 02:32:58.699]  I think so.
[02:33:24.741 --> 02:33:27.682]  About 15 years ago when I really woke up to the New World Order.
[02:33:27.682 --> 02:33:33.265]  I mean, I'd read None Dare Call a Conspiracy 17 years ago.
[02:33:33.265 --> 02:33:37.327]  I began reading UN documents.
[02:33:37.327 --> 02:33:39.928]  I began reading their own books.
[02:33:39.928 --> 02:33:43.390]  Got a copy of Tragedy and Hope.
[02:33:43.390 --> 02:33:46.992]  And they said they were going to restrict our food, our water, they were going to train us.
[02:33:49.719 --> 02:34:02.058]  Because they said a middle class created liberty and freedom, and now they're training you to accept $4 a gallon gas, they're training you to accept that water isn't inexpensive, artificially, creating artificial scarcity.
[02:34:02.058 --> 02:34:04.302]  They are training you how to be a slave!
[02:34:04.952 --> 02:34:12.534]  They want 99% of us being absolutely slaves living in shacks with roving bands of heavily armed paramilitary police ruling over us.
[02:34:12.534 --> 02:34:13.635]  And that is the New World Order.
[02:34:13.635 --> 02:34:14.475]  That's what they say it is.
[02:34:14.475 --> 02:34:16.355]  I've heard NPR many times.
[02:34:16.355 --> 02:34:18.496]  We've got a guest coming on who's going to push it.
[02:34:18.496 --> 02:34:24.578]  So you can hear it from the horse's mouth about how we consume too much and how we're bad and how we've got to pay.
[02:34:24.578 --> 02:34:26.558]  For lack of a better term, this is communism.
[02:34:26.558 --> 02:34:29.019]  I mean, for us, it will be living like communist slaves.
[02:34:29.019 --> 02:34:32.060]  For the elite, they get all the... I mean, here in Austin, they took
[02:34:33.450 --> 02:34:41.532]  Tens of thousands of acres, and two different big land buys, claiming they were going to turn it into huge city parks, that no houses could be built on it.
[02:34:41.532 --> 02:34:53.295]  They would, for a decade, told farmers, ranchers, that they couldn't sell the property, they increased their taxes on it, that they couldn't build on it for the earth, for the Edwardsographer, for the salamander, claiming runoff was hurting the salamander.
[02:34:53.295 --> 02:35:02.158]  As soon as they got it, five-star hotels, golf courses, luxury spas, million-dollar, five-million-dollar, they started a million ranchettes,
[02:35:04.528 --> 02:35:09.831]  And the elite are all moving in there.
[02:35:09.831 --> 02:35:10.932]  I mean, I live here.
[02:35:10.932 --> 02:35:17.976]  I mean, I've been in radio debates on other radio shows with the local SOS people and local environmental heads, and they'll just laugh.
[02:35:17.976 --> 02:35:20.397]  In the parking lot, they'll go, Jones, you're not gonna stop us.
[02:35:21.383 --> 02:35:25.386]  And I've been to smart growth conferences where they'll just laugh, even on stage, and go, yeah, it's about money.
[02:35:25.386 --> 02:35:26.047]  We're taking over.
[02:35:26.047 --> 02:35:27.988]  And they just start laughing.
[02:35:27.988 --> 02:35:30.270]  I mean, these are vicious criminals, folks.
[02:35:30.270 --> 02:35:40.959]  You just need to go to a smart growth conference and see, like they had here, several thousand city managers and bank heads of major banks and the owner of Dell Computers, Michael Dell.
[02:35:40.959 --> 02:35:41.639]  I interviewed him.
[02:35:41.639 --> 02:35:42.660]  I gotta find that tape.
[02:35:42.660 --> 02:35:43.581]  We put it on Access.
[02:35:43.581 --> 02:35:44.481]  People have seen it.
[02:35:44.481 --> 02:35:45.883]  The newspaper wrote it up.
[02:35:45.883 --> 02:35:47.624]  It's in the Austin Chronicle, their write-up on it.
[02:35:47.624 --> 02:35:48.825]  I can't even find my own tape.
[02:35:50.310 --> 02:35:50.990]  And I laid it out.
[02:35:50.990 --> 02:35:52.471]  I mean, it is business.
[02:35:52.471 --> 02:35:56.352]  Because, you see, the people with connections get to build a factory, or get to build a hotel.
[02:35:56.352 --> 02:35:57.853]  It means you don't.
[02:35:57.853 --> 02:36:00.434]  Do you understand?
[02:36:00.434 --> 02:36:04.916]  Now, tying into all this, and I'm going to tell you right now, I hope he's wrong.
[02:36:04.916 --> 02:36:06.336]  I don't know what's going to happen.
[02:36:06.336 --> 02:36:13.679]  But he told us a year ago on air that food prices were going to go up, and they have gone up globally about 50 percent, about 25 to 30 percent, depending on what it is.
[02:36:13.679 --> 02:36:15.580]  Some of them have doubled.
[02:36:15.580 --> 02:36:19.882]  They are having rationing, you know, of how much corn or how much rice you can buy places.
[02:36:21.251 --> 02:36:25.634]  Uh, but farmers are putting in, at least around here in Texas, we're seeing farming come back.
[02:36:25.634 --> 02:36:27.495]  So that's one thing that's happened.
[02:36:27.495 --> 02:36:28.516]  Steve will tell you.
[02:36:28.516 --> 02:36:32.679]  And I did look up the numbers he said a month ago when he was on with us.
[02:36:32.679 --> 02:36:37.722]  He said that they were raising less corn this year than last, and I went and looked it up, and he was right.
[02:36:37.722 --> 02:36:41.925]  I mean, I actually was... I believe Steve believes what he's saying, but I was...
[02:36:42.731 --> 02:36:45.793]  Really getting shocked by it, so I did some research that night.
[02:36:45.793 --> 02:36:50.537]  I listened to the rebroadcast and wrote down a bunch of things he said and went and looked it up and it was happening.
[02:36:50.537 --> 02:37:09.191]  Now, a lot of this is speculation because the dollars are being devalued, so people are dumping their dollars globally into that, but a lot of it is bad weather, tsunamis, hurricanes, typhoons, too much rain, too little rain, and then of course the dollar being devalued, and then ethanol and the rest of it.
[02:37:10.932 --> 02:37:12.352]  The prices have gone up.
[02:37:12.352 --> 02:37:13.513]  There is talk of depression.
[02:37:13.513 --> 02:37:16.274]  It's smart to have storable food, and that's why I'm pushing this.
[02:37:16.274 --> 02:37:17.694]  I believe in it, and I've done it.
[02:37:17.694 --> 02:37:20.535]  Steve thinks it's curtains, and he's in food supply.
[02:37:20.535 --> 02:37:28.458]  It's a big company, and so he's here to give us a report on what he's seeing as a big food supplier, somebody who gets it from the bigger suppliers.
[02:37:28.458 --> 02:37:32.180]  Steve Shank, thank you for coming on with us, eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:37:33.325 --> 02:37:36.687]  Well, it's great to be again with you.
[02:37:36.687 --> 02:37:41.510]  It's just absolutely amazing what goes on, Alex.
[02:37:41.510 --> 02:37:46.133]  This last week, we got an interesting report.
[02:37:46.133 --> 02:37:57.941]  The financial organizations are reporting the fact that we now are dealing, at least to a certain extent, with our international trade deficit.
[02:37:59.041 --> 02:38:12.910]  Notwithstanding the fact that the dollar is crashing, we are now selling enough stuff so that the balance of trade, the trade deficit the United States has, is being reduced.
[02:38:12.910 --> 02:38:15.732]  But guess what they're selling to reduce it?
[02:38:15.732 --> 02:38:27.260]  They're selling our food and they're selling our production, which gets counted as a trade deal, when the farms move from the Valley in Texas or Southern California to Mexico.
[02:38:28.362 --> 02:38:29.003]  That's right.
[02:38:29.003 --> 02:38:30.344]  So we're even moving production.
[02:38:30.344 --> 02:38:32.346]  It's all over, yeah.
[02:38:32.346 --> 02:38:33.787]  Absolutely.
[02:38:33.787 --> 02:38:44.757]  And the thing is, is that we announced the last time that you and I talked the fact that we have rationing of rice and wheat flour in this country.
[02:38:47.363 --> 02:38:59.101]  We counseled people to put in at least two gallons of cooking oil for each adult one-year supply of food that they were storing back.
[02:39:00.205 --> 02:39:04.167]  Now, here's what has happened just recently.
[02:39:04.167 --> 02:39:08.189]  At the same time, we have people virtually standing in bread lines.
[02:39:08.189 --> 02:39:21.295]  Now, McDonald's announced the fact that they're not going to increase the cost of their $1 menu because it would affect the way investors look at their stock.
[02:39:21.295 --> 02:39:22.656]  So they're subsidizing.
[02:39:22.656 --> 02:39:26.518]  Those of you that are not buying the $1 menu are subsidizing.
[02:39:26.518 --> 02:39:27.899]  Let me stop you, Mexico.
[02:39:29.545 --> 02:39:39.644]  is also announcing they're trying to freeze prices, and then I also saw Walmart is gonna freeze, but then they're gonna have to ration, and so you're right, because that would then affect their stock.
[02:39:39.644 --> 02:39:40.165]  Go ahead, sorry.
[02:39:41.553 --> 02:40:01.491]  so what happens uh... what happens is virtually americans are standing in bread lines the people that are going to mcdonald's and buying their one dollar menu because that's all they can afford they are being subsidized by the rest of you that are buying the regular menu at mcdonald's and that's nothing more than a bread line only you're subsidizing it
[02:40:02.432 --> 02:40:14.515]  The fact is that we have Americans going to the grocery stores and being told that they can't get as much wheat flour as they want and in some areas they're not getting it at all.
[02:40:14.515 --> 02:40:24.837]  We're having Americans go to buy rice and be told in even small stores that they can only have one bag and sometimes none at all.
[02:40:24.837 --> 02:40:29.858]  So we virtually have bread lines forming here in the United States and
[02:40:30.518 --> 02:40:51.367]  The thieves now have discovered that $4 a gallon of fuel is more expensive than the cooking oil that they can steal from the fast food restaurants and turn into fuel.
[02:40:51.367 --> 02:40:52.848]  So we have a double hit.
[02:40:53.408 --> 02:40:55.789]  Alex, the double hit is very simple.
[02:40:55.789 --> 02:40:59.550]  Fuel prices are going up astronomically.
[02:40:59.550 --> 02:41:02.271]  Food prices are going up astronomically.
[02:41:02.271 --> 02:41:06.172]  And anytime you have that happen, you will have the criminal element involved.
[02:41:06.172 --> 02:41:16.175]  And literally, criminals are stealing the cooking oil from fast food restaurants in order to turn it into diesel fuel.
[02:41:16.175 --> 02:41:20.676]  Now, what this all means to you and me and Joe Lunchbucket out there is very simple.
[02:41:21.797 --> 02:41:31.673]  We are standing in bread lines, our fuel is going past our ability to even get to our jobs, and they are selling our food.
[02:41:32.850 --> 02:41:38.271]  To resolve the national trade deficit and bragging about it.
[02:41:38.271 --> 02:41:41.572]  Commodities investors are bragging about buying up... Well, let's explain.
[02:41:41.572 --> 02:41:47.134]  The dollar's tanking, so we are like a third world country, so we're being looted.
[02:41:47.134 --> 02:41:59.217]  Everybody's coming in, not just buying ports and roads and the police department and the water district and everything being handed over and cops out doubling, tripling the tickets they're riding, squeezing the poor pathetic slaves.
[02:41:59.217 --> 02:41:59.537]  Now,
[02:42:00.598 --> 02:42:03.664]  Uh, on top of all of that, they're buying up the food.
[02:42:04.687 --> 02:42:05.688]  That's right.
[02:42:05.688 --> 02:42:16.013]  Now what this means very simply, about two weeks ago we announced on your program that we were forced into a price increase.
[02:42:16.013 --> 02:42:26.579]  And the reason for that, you'll find that some of the retailers, many folks are finding that there are retailers selling these long-term storable foods.
[02:42:26.579 --> 02:42:30.661]  Many of them didn't have to go with price increases because they're still selling junk left over from 1999.
[02:42:32.382 --> 02:42:47.715]  One of the things that we're doing, people are trusting eFoods Direct as a result of your counsel with them, and they're buying food, and we guarantee that nothing is stored from any longer than when we get the order.
[02:42:47.715 --> 02:42:53.560]  So we're buying in fresh stuff, but the disadvantage is that the pricing is pricing we've got to pay.
[02:42:53.560 --> 02:42:57.203]  So what we did was exactly the same thing we've been telling people to do.
[02:42:57.203 --> 02:42:58.084]  We went out and bought
[02:42:59.136 --> 02:43:13.287]  Truckloads of wheat back before it started being rationed when we were seeing the wheat problems coming up and as a result of that we just got delivery on several of those truckloads.
[02:43:13.287 --> 02:43:15.889]  Two weeks ago we announced a price increase.
[02:43:16.830 --> 02:43:33.673]  Right now as a result of having all that wheat and being able to trade it back to the suppliers for other items like fruits and vegetables that are virtually impossible to get right now at the supply lines, we are now announcing for the first time on your show
[02:43:34.662 --> 02:43:45.146]  That we are going to have a rollback almost to the point of where the price increase started just because we did exactly what we're telling your listeners to do.
[02:43:45.146 --> 02:43:53.429]  We're telling your listeners to go out and get food in while they can still afford it and then when the prices go astronomical they don't have to be afraid of the problems.
[02:43:53.849 --> 02:44:01.534]  What we have done is we've traded several truckloads of wheat for the other fruits and vegetables so that they're all fresh.
[02:44:01.534 --> 02:44:18.925]  And now, if you look on the website, efoodsdirect.com, you'll find we're announcing a rollback of the price increase we had a couple weeks ago to almost the same prices we had, and we're going to be able to ship out food
[02:44:19.785 --> 02:44:26.547]  at considerably less than what these people would have to be paying just because we did exactly what we're telling them to do.
[02:44:26.547 --> 02:44:36.689]  Go out and get the dad gum food while you can afford it before it disappears, before it's rationed, before you can't buy it and call efoodsdirect.com and do it.
[02:44:36.689 --> 02:44:43.591]  Okay, efoodsdirect.com, big links at the top of infowars.com and prisonplanet.com, but Steve, give out the phone number.
[02:44:44.625 --> 02:44:44.845]  It's 800-409-5633.
[02:44:44.845 --> 02:44:47.186]  For those of you that aren't up on the internet, 800-409-5633.
[02:44:47.186 --> 02:44:50.247]  The main thing that I'm dealing with in this, Alex, is the fact that
[02:45:00.590 --> 02:45:10.903]  As a result of analyzing the news and what's happening out there in the future, I know that it makes you nervous when we come back with this stuff, but these aren't wild-eyed predictions.
[02:45:10.903 --> 02:45:18.633]  We've been at this for 27 years, Alex, and it may look like, gee whiz, I've got some sort of a crystal ball.
[02:45:19.534 --> 02:45:23.355]  The fact is that history repeats itself.
[02:45:23.355 --> 02:45:25.636]  People behave in a certain way.
[02:45:25.636 --> 02:45:42.401]  If we know the objective is to control the population with food, it doesn't take a brain surgeon to look at the fact that we have shortages in America, our food is being sold off, the grain markets are screaming because foreign countries are coming in here with cheap American dollars.
[02:45:44.002 --> 02:45:44.302]  1-800-409-5633.
[02:45:44.302 --> 02:45:44.482]  1-800-409-5633.
[02:45:44.482 --> 02:45:55.109]  No, I mean, with the talk of depression, with huge inflation that's happening, I think it's a good idea to have storable food in any uncertain times.
[02:45:55.109 --> 02:45:59.191]  I've been storing food for 10 years plus, so I believe in it, Steve.
[02:45:59.191 --> 02:46:09.538]  My only issue is that it's just hard to believe it's going to get as bad as even the mainstream media is saying, and I've seen them do that before, and I think maybe the speculation could end or a big crop could come in.
[02:46:10.285 --> 02:46:15.929]  But then I go look things up, and they are growing less corn than they did last year, which is pretty bizarre.
[02:46:15.929 --> 02:46:20.112]  And so we know a lot of things that are corn-fed, like meats and things, are going to go up.
[02:46:20.112 --> 02:46:23.274]  So there's no doubt that it's a good idea to have storable foods.
[02:46:23.274 --> 02:46:25.676]  I just... I know they're doing this.
[02:46:25.676 --> 02:46:26.797]  I mean, I know they're doing this, okay?
[02:46:26.797 --> 02:46:33.041]  I know they engineered the gas going up in the 70s, and the documents have now come out to train us to accept higher gas prices.
[02:46:33.041 --> 02:46:35.183]  So we know they're artificially doing that now.
[02:46:35.183 --> 02:46:38.065]  And I know they're training us to accept higher food prices now.
[02:46:38.065 --> 02:46:39.166]  This is part of our raping.
[02:46:39.586 --> 02:46:41.266]  So I know this is happening.
[02:46:41.266 --> 02:46:43.387]  My whole deal is, is that this is what I've seen them do.
[02:46:43.387 --> 02:46:48.848]  They'll run gas up from a dollar to two dollars, and it drops back down to a dollar fifty, and you're happy to take a dollar fifty.
[02:46:48.848 --> 02:46:52.488]  Then they run it up to three dollars, you're happy to take two fifty when it goes back down.
[02:46:52.488 --> 02:46:55.269]  Then they run it up to three fifty, and you're happy to have it be three dollars.
[02:46:55.269 --> 02:47:00.290]  Then they run it up to four fifty, like it's going now, and then you're happy when it's only three fifty.
[02:47:00.290 --> 02:47:07.531]  So my thing is, is yeah, no, I mean the way the world's operating and the crazy government we've got, and I think people should go storeable foods, I just
[02:47:08.377 --> 02:47:17.663]  I just never know what they're going to do next because it's so confusing, but you are there in the food company, so you're seeing it, and you're telling me that you say it's going to get worse.
[02:47:17.663 --> 02:47:20.104]  Well, I'll tell you exactly what's going on.
[02:47:20.104 --> 02:47:31.991]  I've got a whole bunch of cattle ranchers out in Missouri that I'm going to have a meeting with next weekend, and we're discussing what the situation is.
[02:47:31.991 --> 02:47:34.673]  The farmers that are growing the grains
[02:47:35.905 --> 02:47:54.477]  The grains are being boosted up so high in price, the corn particularly, which is the mash for the cattle, because of subsidizing of ethanol, these farmers can't afford to buy the feed to feed your dairy cows, to feed your poultry, to feed all of your basic protein source for the country.
[02:47:54.477 --> 02:48:00.902]  They are now selling out dairy herds because the farmers can't afford to feed them.
[02:48:01.522 --> 02:48:09.230]  Now what that's going to do, and this is a prediction, but... That's going to be a chain reaction in all milk products.
[02:48:09.230 --> 02:48:14.676]  Well, not only that, you're going to have a glut in the beef market and your beef prices might go down for a little bit.
[02:48:14.676 --> 02:48:17.639]  And then after that you won't have any beef at all.
[02:48:17.639 --> 02:48:23.725]  And what will happen is that we have the rice farmers
[02:48:24.426 --> 02:48:25.547]  that are being paid.
[02:48:25.547 --> 02:48:46.505]  You see, one of the big issues right now, if you watch the commodities investors, if you as consumers, if our listeners would just watch where the commodities investors are throwing their money and then run out real quick and buy that first, then they will be right on target as to what the shortages are going to be next time.
[02:48:47.305 --> 02:48:53.648]  In fact, one of the things I'm going to do with my radio show is we're going to have a commodities issue that tells people what to buy.
[02:48:53.648 --> 02:49:01.131]  For example, if you know that they're selling off wheat and we've got bread lines on wheat, folks, go out and put in enough wheat.
[02:49:01.131 --> 02:49:08.474]  It's going to take about 200 pounds of wheat in your storage to provide you a half a loaf of bread a day for a year for one adult.
[02:49:08.474 --> 02:49:09.254]  Okay?
[02:49:09.254 --> 02:49:13.336]  That's information you can get from efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[02:49:15.657 --> 02:49:16.158]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:49:16.158 --> 02:49:19.722]  You're also not just selling high-quality freeze-dried and dehydrated foods.
[02:49:19.722 --> 02:49:22.965]  You're also giving people advice, showing them other places to go.
[02:49:22.965 --> 02:49:30.994]  You have a Sunday afternoon radio show right before mine starts, and so you're here on the Genesis Network.
[02:49:30.994 --> 02:49:32.937]  Tell folks about that radio show.
[02:49:32.937 --> 02:49:34.098]  And you're also on weeknights.
[02:49:35.322 --> 02:49:35.882]  Yep.
[02:49:35.882 --> 02:49:41.985]  Well, what we're doing is we're trying to keep you folks informed as to exactly what's going on with food.
[02:49:41.985 --> 02:49:53.091]  We're going to have a commodities section, which I know is boring to all of you, but we're going to tell you how you can invest in your family, just like the profit takers are investing.
[02:49:53.091 --> 02:49:54.812]  Steve, we're almost out of time.
[02:49:54.812 --> 02:49:56.793]  Tell folks what time your radio show is on weeknights.
[02:49:58.171 --> 02:50:10.079]  Well, we're on 7 to 8 each night, and on the weekends, right after Roger, for two hours from 6 to 8 Central Time.
[02:50:10.079 --> 02:50:16.203]  And the fellow that's handling that for me now, I'm not on the radio, I've gotten too busy with everything I've got to do.
[02:50:16.203 --> 02:50:22.027]  A fellow by the name of Roger Fredenberg has taken over the show for me, but we counsel together as to what we're going to do.
[02:50:22.027 --> 02:50:23.047]  Yeah, Roger's a big talk show.
[02:50:24.108 --> 02:50:25.288]  Roger's a big talk show host.
[02:50:25.288 --> 02:50:29.870]  Fire out the phone number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:50:29.870 --> 02:50:34.112]  1-800-409-5633. efoodsdirect.com.
[02:50:34.112 --> 02:50:36.132]  Steve, give us another update in a few weeks.
[02:50:36.132 --> 02:50:37.733]  Thanks for coming on.
[02:50:37.733 --> 02:50:38.093]  Will do.
[02:50:38.093 --> 02:50:38.973]  Talk to you then.
[02:50:38.973 --> 02:50:39.253]  All right.
[02:50:39.253 --> 02:50:41.274]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with more news.
[02:50:41.274 --> 02:50:41.994]  A big guest.

[02:54:52.086 --> 02:54:55.249]  Frontline in the Info War.
[02:55:10.151 --> 02:55:22.141]  I'm Alex Jones, defending liberty, resisting tyranny.
[02:55:22.141 --> 02:55:32.570]  Yeah, I'm glad I went crazy, or I would have gone insane.
[02:55:32.570 --> 02:55:33.691]  Good part right here, crank it up.
[02:55:40.666 --> 02:55:53.415]  That's right, I'm the sane one.
[02:55:53.415 --> 02:56:00.240]  I read hundreds of government documents and think tank documents how they're poisoning our water and our food, killing us.
[02:56:00.240 --> 02:56:01.281]  You bet I go crazy!
[02:56:07.489 --> 02:56:08.489]  Yeah.
[02:56:08.489 --> 02:56:12.170]  Crazy's just doing something that the majority doesn't do.
[02:56:12.170 --> 02:56:17.611]  You know what they told the first black men?
[02:56:17.611 --> 02:56:23.653]  Who grabbed the hickory stick out of their master's hands and beat their brains out with it?
[02:56:23.653 --> 02:56:28.414]  They said, that boy crazy, the other guys in the slave pit.
[02:56:28.414 --> 02:56:32.995]  No, he wasn't crazy.
[02:56:32.995 --> 02:56:34.035]  No, they were crazy.
[02:56:35.487 --> 02:56:39.308]  I'm not going to stay down in the bottom of a hold of a ship like cattle.
[02:56:39.308 --> 02:56:41.169]  I'm not a slave.
[02:56:41.169 --> 02:56:49.171]  My ancestors killed people that tried to enslave them.
[02:56:49.171 --> 02:56:52.972]  What about your ancestors?
[02:56:52.972 --> 02:56:54.292]  Get off my back.
[02:56:54.292 --> 02:56:55.393]  Get out of my way.
[02:56:55.393 --> 02:56:57.133]  I'm not trying to run your life.
[02:56:57.133 --> 02:57:02.215]  Don't run mine, you trash.
[02:57:02.215 --> 02:57:03.235]  Get out of my way!
[02:57:04.577 --> 02:57:06.718]  Get out of my way!
[02:57:06.718 --> 02:57:09.240]  You want to go jump off a cliff and be a loser?
[02:57:09.240 --> 02:57:10.841]  Go do it!
[02:57:10.841 --> 02:57:15.104]  But get out of my way.
[02:57:15.104 --> 02:57:17.386]  We'll see if he ends up showing up at the show.
[02:57:17.386 --> 02:57:20.828]  San Francisco sets precedent and poses carbon tax on businesses.
[02:57:20.828 --> 02:57:22.489]  We even have that newscast.
[02:57:22.489 --> 02:57:27.673]  John, I forgot to tell you, dig that newscast out on the San Francisco carbon tax I gave you Monday.
[02:57:27.673 --> 02:57:28.133]  You got that?
[02:57:29.992 --> 02:57:31.773]  Yeah, I want to play that, bringing our guest in.
[02:57:31.773 --> 02:57:37.115]  We'll see if our guest shows up for the show.
[02:57:37.115 --> 02:57:42.798]  Government official, government authority, with the new carbon tax.
[02:57:42.798 --> 02:57:48.681]  And they said, don't worry, California's about to pass one, too, under Lord Schwarzenegger.
[02:57:48.681 --> 02:57:56.665]  And we're going to get his take on what this is going to do and how this is going to operate and what's going to happen when we get back.
[02:57:56.665 --> 02:57:58.906]  So we'll tell you about that here in just a minute or two.
[02:58:00.797 --> 02:58:06.141]  Fourth hour, the new fourth hour, and as new as it once was, doing it a couple months now.
[02:58:06.141 --> 02:58:09.323]  Straight ahead, then I'll be back live Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:58:09.323 --> 02:58:11.244]  Central Standard Time.
[02:58:11.244 --> 02:58:17.789]  Don't forget, don't forget, I'll be live tomorrow night, 8 to midnight.
[02:58:17.789 --> 02:58:23.573]  That's right, a four-hour show just at InfoWars.com.
[02:58:23.573 --> 02:58:24.894]  For the Money Bomb, we'll be right back.

[02:59:40.267 --> 02:59:42.648]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:42.648 --> 02:59:45.410]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:05.569 --> 03:00:18.939]  Yes, as Saruman said in the Lord of the Rings, when he was selling out to the Dark Tower, that is a new time upon us.
[03:00:18.939 --> 03:00:25.443]  One must merge with the eye.
[03:00:25.443 --> 03:00:30.107]  And that is basically what's happening as we go into this new system.
[03:00:31.949 --> 03:00:37.751]  And we are certainly in a new dawn, a new age, a new system.
[03:00:37.751 --> 03:00:52.136]  And help leading that merger is Jeffrey McKay, Deputy Air Pollution Officer, is an officer, in San Francisco where the state's racing to pass a carbon footprint carbon tax.
[03:00:52.136 --> 03:00:55.537]  England moving with cards, it'll track and trace how much carbon you use.
[03:00:55.537 --> 03:00:56.838]  Same thing in the U.S.
[03:00:56.838 --> 03:01:00.019]  They're starting, of course, with all the businesses
[03:01:01.431 --> 03:01:07.074]  And he, of course, comes to us from IBM.
[03:01:07.074 --> 03:01:08.315]  Yes.
[03:01:08.315 --> 03:01:10.576]  Doesn't it all come to us from IBM?
[03:01:10.576 --> 03:01:14.559]  He's a PhD in Applied Physics from Yale University.
[03:01:14.559 --> 03:01:18.441]  And so we appreciate Jeffrey McKay from San Francisco.
[03:01:18.441 --> 03:01:23.004]  Headline, San Francisco sets precedent, imposes carbon tax on businesses.
[03:01:23.004 --> 03:01:27.066]  But don't worry, it's a very small tax, kind of like your income tax started.
[03:01:27.066 --> 03:01:29.888]  Mr. McKay, it is wonderful to have you on with us.
[03:01:30.771 --> 03:01:31.191]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:01:31.191 --> 03:01:33.593]  It's a pleasure to be on your station with you.
[03:01:33.593 --> 03:01:34.814]  Good.
[03:01:34.814 --> 03:01:40.037]  I've got to ask my producer, how long do we have you scheduled for?
[03:01:40.037 --> 03:01:41.658]  He said something like 15 minutes.
[03:01:41.658 --> 03:01:42.298]  Oh, that's perfect.
[03:01:42.298 --> 03:01:42.899]  We're about to break.
[03:01:42.899 --> 03:01:43.379]  I want to come back.
[03:01:43.379 --> 03:01:45.360]  How about until 20 after?
[03:01:45.360 --> 03:01:49.703]  Sir, tell us about what San Francisco is doing and tell us about yourself and what type of officer you are.
[03:01:49.703 --> 03:01:51.224]  Oh, certainly.
[03:01:51.224 --> 03:01:57.408]  The Bay Area Air Quality Management District was established a little over 50 years ago.
[03:01:57.408 --> 03:01:58.129]  And at that time,
[03:01:59.457 --> 03:02:06.619]  The state gave the authority to the Air Pollution Control Officer to permit polluting facilities in the Bay Area.
[03:02:06.619 --> 03:02:18.302]  And my title is Deputy Air Pollution Control Officer, so that means that I have that responsibility when our Chief Executive is not in the office.
[03:02:18.302 --> 03:02:25.743]  Now, I've got a newscast reporting that it's basically bakeries, auto shops, just thousands of businesses.
[03:02:25.743 --> 03:02:28.244]  What will be under this new umbrella?
[03:02:29.645 --> 03:02:36.250]  Well, it's actually the same group of facilities that the Air District already regulates.
[03:02:36.250 --> 03:02:38.652]  Excuse me, and has regulated for some time.
[03:02:38.652 --> 03:02:42.976]  So it's about two and a half thousand facilities in the Bay Area, all stationary sources.
[03:02:42.976 --> 03:02:46.178]  In other words, meaning not cars, for instance.
[03:02:46.178 --> 03:02:54.305]  And it ranges anything from small backup generators in smaller facilities all the way up to the large refineries that we have in this area.
[03:02:54.305 --> 03:02:55.266]  The vast majority
[03:02:55.811 --> 03:03:02.952]  of these groups are only paying fees of less than a dollar.
[03:03:02.952 --> 03:03:06.313]  Yeah, but the income tax started real low, too.
[03:03:06.313 --> 03:03:12.874]  First we had voluntary, you know, emissions testing as they keep lowering and lowering and lowering it until no one can pass.
[03:03:12.874 --> 03:03:16.455]  And then, of course, it became mandatory and they jacked it up.
[03:03:16.455 --> 03:03:17.956]  We have 9,000 PhDs, 31,000 scientists,
[03:03:20.496 --> 03:03:22.798]  Who have signed saying carbon dioxide is good.
[03:03:22.798 --> 03:03:25.721]  It reverses the expansion of deserts.
[03:03:25.721 --> 03:03:30.265]  Plants like actually 10 times higher carbon dioxide that then produce higher oxygen.
[03:03:30.265 --> 03:03:31.827]  All the ice core samples back 300,000 years.
[03:03:31.827 --> 03:03:33.268]  You're of course a physicist.
[03:03:33.268 --> 03:03:34.409]  I'm wondering if you've looked into this.
[03:03:34.409 --> 03:03:36.832]  But I've had Nobel Prize winners and others on about it.
[03:03:36.832 --> 03:03:42.257]  They're saying that carbon dioxide is one of the four elements of main life on this planet.
[03:03:42.737 --> 03:03:46.678]  That's oxygen, carbon dioxide, solar radiation, and water.
[03:03:46.678 --> 03:03:51.020]  And this is a tax on breathing, as the New York Times called it, once they're done expanding it.
[03:03:51.020 --> 03:03:55.681]  I mean, it's not proven that carbon dioxide is a devil weapon.
[03:03:55.681 --> 03:03:58.602]  Why are you moving ahead with this?
[03:03:58.602 --> 03:04:08.925]  You know, certainly this is a field where research continues to be done, and there are people with very defensible positions on different sides of the topic.
[03:04:09.702 --> 03:04:13.404]  What we're doing here is actually a very modest first step.
[03:04:13.404 --> 03:04:24.891]  In other words, because we already have in place a system that regulates those emissions that are unquestionably bad for human health,
[03:04:25.379 --> 03:04:37.914]  We're able to use that existing system to, uh, very efficiently, as I said, for only 4.4 cents per ton, uh, produce an inventory of the emissions in the Bay Area.
[03:04:37.914 --> 03:04:38.334]  Stay there.
[03:04:38.334 --> 03:04:40.697]  Oh, a tracking, categorizing, and stay there, sir.
[03:04:40.697 --> 03:04:43.000]  We'll be back in three short minutes with a final segment.
[03:04:44.235 --> 03:04:48.500]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[03:04:48.500 --> 03:04:52.065]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[03:04:52.065 --> 03:04:55.569]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[03:04:55.808 --> 03:04:59.070]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[03:04:59.070 --> 03:05:04.593]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we've seen.
[03:05:04.593 --> 03:05:14.339]  When we do our program, you know, herbal formulas like cardivite and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill now going for regular jobs a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[03:05:14.339 --> 03:05:15.720]  It's a well-thought-out formula.
[03:05:15.720 --> 03:05:21.123]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[03:05:21.623 --> 03:05:26.144]  You'll find, I think, that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[03:05:26.144 --> 03:05:27.665]  It'll work on other problems as well.

[03:05:33.566 --> 03:05:33.646]  1-877-928-8822.
[03:05:33.646 --> 03:05:34.467]  It is a big idea.
[03:05:34.467 --> 03:05:36.167]  A new world order.
[03:05:36.167 --> 03:05:37.628]  In the near future.
[03:05:50.453 --> 03:05:53.514]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[03:05:53.514 --> 03:05:56.335]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[03:05:56.335 --> 03:05:59.136]  Don't their objective be world domination?
[03:05:59.136 --> 03:06:02.317]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[03:06:02.317 --> 03:06:09.640]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[03:06:12.679 --> 03:06:18.103]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[03:06:18.103 --> 03:06:21.985]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[03:06:21.985 --> 03:06:24.547]  Bill Burgess is making great progress toward a world government.
[03:06:24.547 --> 03:06:25.728]  Most people have no idea.
[03:06:25.728 --> 03:06:26.508]  They're not after money.
[03:06:26.508 --> 03:06:27.789]  They have all the money they need.
[03:06:27.789 --> 03:06:28.750]  They're after power.
[03:06:28.750 --> 03:06:29.911]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[03:06:43.420 --> 03:06:52.007]  Hi, my name is William Lewis, and if you're listening to this radio station, then chances are, you've probably seen one or two of the documentaries that I've made over the years.
[03:06:52.007 --> 03:06:57.412]  9-1-1 in plain sight, Beyond Treason, or maybe 9-1-1 Ripple Effect.
[03:06:57.412 --> 03:07:03.578]  And by now, you've got to be as angry as I am, and wondering, what else have they done, and what are we gonna do about it?
[03:07:04.392 --> 03:07:14.778]  My latest documentary, Washington You're Fired, was made to explore these ideas of change, while at the same time exposing the scope of the President's immoral and illegal spy program.
[03:07:14.778 --> 03:07:22.322]  We reveal the abuses committed under the Protection of the Patriot Act, Military Commissions Act, and other very intrusive spy bills.
[03:07:22.322 --> 03:07:30.547]  Washington You're Fired explores the removal of habeas corpus, posse comitatus, and the subversion of our entire Bill of Rights.

[03:08:00.993 --> 03:08:05.036]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:08:06.434 --> 03:08:12.236]  Huge breaking news at InfoWars.net right now after our guest leaves us in about 15 minutes.
[03:08:12.236 --> 03:08:13.737]  We're going to cover it.
[03:08:13.737 --> 03:08:15.557]  Worst vaccine bill ever.
[03:08:15.557 --> 03:08:18.458]  Seeks compulsory shots for all children.
[03:08:18.458 --> 03:08:19.519]  They've never had a law.
[03:08:19.519 --> 03:08:29.342]  They've had to buffalo and intimidate and lie under color of law and felony, um, color of law scams to get people to do it.
[03:08:29.342 --> 03:08:33.304]  Now they're moving with the total police state with their eugenics operation.
[03:08:34.316 --> 03:08:36.578]  Uh, with a bunch of unwitting idiots in the system.
[03:08:36.578 --> 03:08:39.020]  I have no idea what larger system they're in.
[03:08:39.020 --> 03:08:41.162]  Uh, we're talking to Jeff McKay.
[03:08:41.162 --> 03:08:43.984]  He's Deputy Air Pollution Control Officer.
[03:08:43.984 --> 03:08:48.567]  Uh, and let's just play about a minute of this local, uh, newscast.
[03:08:48.567 --> 03:08:52.831]  Go ahead and play some of that local newscast so people know what we're talking about here in San Francisco.
[03:08:53.451 --> 03:09:00.358]  Area air pollution leaders are set to vote on an unprecedented pollution fee today for businesses that emit greenhouse gases.
[03:09:00.358 --> 03:09:06.144]  Thousands of businesses would be impacted by that move, which is thought to be the first of its kind in the nation.
[03:09:06.144 --> 03:09:12.191]  NBC 11's Christy Smith live now in San Francisco, where the Bay Area Quality Management District is meeting right now.
[03:09:12.191 --> 03:09:12.451]  Christy?
[03:09:12.911 --> 03:09:13.572]  Good morning, Brent.
[03:09:13.572 --> 03:09:16.934]  Yeah, I was just told moments ago that this was indeed approved.
[03:09:16.934 --> 03:09:19.415]  They just took the vote about 15 minutes ago.
[03:09:19.415 --> 03:09:27.200]  Now, this will affect all sorts of businesses, from bakeries to gas stations, but certainly oil refineries in the Bay Area will be hit the hardest.
[03:09:27.200 --> 03:09:27.500]  Okay.
[03:09:27.500 --> 03:09:29.061]  On average, about a hundred... Alright.
[03:09:29.759 --> 03:09:39.349]  Now, let me go back to our guest who is the deputy head of this operation, Deputy Air Pollution Officer there in San Francisco.
[03:09:39.349 --> 03:09:47.778]  Dr. McKay holds a PhD in Applied Physics from Yale University and of course comes to us from IBM where he was a Chief Information Officer
[03:09:49.565 --> 03:09:51.666]  So let's go ahead and go back to him.
[03:09:51.666 --> 03:09:53.067]  So you're now there.
[03:09:53.067 --> 03:09:57.650]  Boy, you're a pretty high-powered, smart guy.
[03:09:57.650 --> 03:09:59.251]  They're now going to city government.
[03:09:59.251 --> 03:10:00.472]  Why'd you decide to go there?
[03:10:00.472 --> 03:10:02.513]  Must be some big potentials there.
[03:10:02.513 --> 03:10:04.495]  Important work you're doing, Doctor?
[03:10:04.495 --> 03:10:08.457]  Well, you know, it's very satisfying work.
[03:10:08.457 --> 03:10:16.863]  Silicon Valley was fun, but I certainly never mind telling people that I'm working to work on air quality.
[03:10:16.863 --> 03:10:17.343]  I never mind.
[03:10:18.362 --> 03:10:21.463]  Having to admit that at a cocktail party.
[03:10:21.463 --> 03:10:22.403]  Feels good.
[03:10:22.403 --> 03:10:24.284]  You're kind of like the new priesthood.
[03:10:24.284 --> 03:10:26.685]  I mean, I'm sure you've read Club of Rome documents.
[03:10:26.685 --> 03:10:34.548]  You in Biological Diversity, where they say the new religion will be carrying out environmentalism, and that certainly is hailed there.
[03:10:34.548 --> 03:10:37.769]  I mean, do you kind of recognize you're part of the new priesthood?
[03:10:37.769 --> 03:10:39.289]  Oh, I don't think of it that way.
[03:10:39.289 --> 03:10:40.150]  I live here.
[03:10:40.150 --> 03:10:41.910]  I ride my bike here.
[03:10:41.910 --> 03:10:43.331]  I jog here.
[03:10:43.331 --> 03:10:43.771]  Sacrament?
[03:10:46.174 --> 03:10:47.634]  It's just a day-to-day experience for me.
[03:10:47.634 --> 03:10:53.976]  Do you ever work with Green Shield there at the Presidio, who developed a lot of these ideas 25 years ago?
[03:10:53.976 --> 03:10:56.037]  Oh, I'm not familiar with them.
[03:10:56.037 --> 03:10:57.337]  Well, I mean, here's the deal.
[03:10:57.337 --> 03:11:09.442]  Have you read Richard N. Haas, chairman of the CFR, admitting that this is a way to control populations and regulate them, and that in England and in the U.S., we're going to have a card we swipe that tracks our entire carbon footprint?
[03:11:09.442 --> 03:11:10.142]  Are you aware of that?
[03:11:11.238 --> 03:11:16.342]  You know, I think that that's getting far, far ahead of what we are attempting to accomplish here.
[03:11:16.342 --> 03:11:24.929]  This is actually simply a small fee that's not supposed to be an incentive of any type, and it's certainly not priced as an incentive.
[03:11:25.595 --> 03:11:29.017]  It's not a large enough fee to have any incentivizing effect.
[03:11:29.017 --> 03:11:30.838]  Kind of like that half percent income tax.
[03:11:30.838 --> 03:11:32.699]  Now, what about the state?
[03:11:32.699 --> 03:11:43.124]  Lord Schwarzenegger, excuse me, Commander Schwarzenegger, Governor Schwarzenegger, the Gropenator, he is coming out with his own carbon tax, isn't he?
[03:11:43.124 --> 03:11:55.030]  Well, I think you're referring to the California Air Resources Board, and it's absolutely true that the California Air Resources Board is mandated with moving ahead looking at how
[03:11:55.999 --> 03:11:56.139]  I think?
[03:12:26.551 --> 03:12:39.877]  And in fact, if, as sometimes happens, they then use those fees to provide for coverage of the costs of the Air District, then we would be able to perhaps revisit our fees.
[03:12:41.508 --> 03:12:56.748]  So you're not worried about overlap because the way I've read this being written up by the policy makers really was codified by the early 90s that you're going to have your local regional directorates, you're going to have your state and then larger regions and then national and then international all interlocking
[03:12:58.289 --> 03:12:59.429]  Now, you can say air quality.
[03:12:59.429 --> 03:13:03.652]  It's one thing to say we want to reduce carbon monoxide, or we want catalytic converters.
[03:13:03.652 --> 03:13:05.013]  Those are good things.
[03:13:05.013 --> 03:13:15.059]  But now, this is all about, I mean, you're saying we can debate the science, and that it's still open for debate, though in Europe they're talking about outlawing it, and that's mainstream news today.
[03:13:15.059 --> 03:13:16.640]  That sounds like freedom.
[03:13:16.640 --> 03:13:20.042]  Sounds like a... I guess you'll be burned at the stake if you don't go along with it.
[03:13:20.042 --> 03:13:21.583]  The carbon dioxide is a deadly poison.
[03:13:22.415 --> 03:13:30.544]  But you can go into crowds of people and give them the scientific name, Doctor, of water, and they'll all, 99% in studies, will say, ban water.
[03:13:30.544 --> 03:13:42.056]  And so meanwhile, California's passed an initiative for massive genetic engineering, cross-species engineering, things that the scientists I've had on, including a Nobel Prize winner on the subject, say it's very dangerous.
[03:13:43.197 --> 03:13:47.099]  You know, stuff kind of like we see in the Andromeda Strain is probably likely.
[03:13:47.099 --> 03:13:48.239]  That's not a problem, though.
[03:13:48.239 --> 03:13:51.000]  We've just got to do something about that carbon dioxide.
[03:13:51.000 --> 03:13:56.883]  And I've read industry saying 20 years ago they wanted to agree on that, because that's something that really isn't bad.
[03:13:56.883 --> 03:14:05.366]  Meanwhile, we're all diverted on that diversion, while all these thousands of real things go on that really are hurting the environment and us individually.
[03:14:05.366 --> 03:14:09.368]  Do you have any comments on that, or are you just separately implementing the first carbon tax in the country?
[03:14:09.870 --> 03:14:35.419]  Certainly, you know, those other topics are obviously fascinating, but in this case, I think it's important to point out that if we do want to make responsible decisions and informed decisions about how to handle any possible problems associated with greenhouse gas emissions, then it's important that we at least understand how much greenhouse gas emissions are occurring in a variety of areas.
[03:14:36.589 --> 03:14:54.465]  The great thing about what's happened here with this very small, modest first step is that by taking advantage of systems we already have in place to monitor unequivocally bad emissions from polluting facilities,
[03:14:54.966 --> 03:14:59.769]  We're able to inventory greenhouse gases for a very... Unequivocal!
[03:14:59.769 --> 03:15:02.030]  Nobody's allowed to release fluorine.
[03:15:02.030 --> 03:15:03.571]  Nobody's allowed to release any of these.
[03:15:03.571 --> 03:15:05.572]  It's all permitted and controlled.
[03:15:05.572 --> 03:15:09.314]  You're reading this, and I'm reading what the law you guys passed in the city.
[03:15:09.314 --> 03:15:10.514]  It's right here in front of me.
[03:15:10.514 --> 03:15:13.396]  This is for carbon dioxide and methane.
[03:15:13.396 --> 03:15:14.036]  Yeah, I'm sorry.
[03:15:14.036 --> 03:15:23.461]  So, to clarify what I'm saying, because we regulate these other gases that everyone agrees are actually bad for human health, because we already have the system in place to regulate these other gases,
[03:15:23.993 --> 03:15:34.903]  We're for a very nominal fee, able to also provide an inventory of greenhouse gases, not for a cost that is prohibitive to anybody, but for a very low cost.
[03:15:34.903 --> 03:15:43.190]  And then the further work, deciding should we really then take steps that would incentivize people one way or another, the further work then can be done in an informed manner.
[03:15:43.630 --> 03:15:48.814]  You're a great salesman because, you know, with the corporate Delphi training and, you know, all that.
[03:15:48.814 --> 03:15:50.275]  Go in, calmly announce it.
[03:15:50.275 --> 03:15:52.916]  Hey, it's very small, and then we'll look at later the next step.
[03:15:52.916 --> 03:15:53.837]  Everything's all right.
[03:15:53.837 --> 03:15:59.441]  And people hear the hothead, you know, guy versus the calm doctor who's there.
[03:15:59.441 --> 03:16:00.721]  And I mean, come on.
[03:16:00.721 --> 03:16:13.230]  You know that you're building the bureaucracy and the measuring facilities and the measuring trainees as the model for the rest of the country to go around and then jack up these taxes on an inert, life-giving gas.
[03:16:13.690 --> 03:16:20.992]  Because you can't tax people's houses because there's no fluorine or radon or anything that really is bad coming out of there.
[03:16:20.992 --> 03:16:27.174]  This is a way to tax basic carbon and to control the planet.
[03:16:27.174 --> 03:16:36.437]  Do you agree, as I hear on NPR, that we're consuming too much and we've got to cut down our carbon footprint and we've got to stop being so wasteful consumers?
[03:16:36.437 --> 03:16:38.778]  That's kind of the mantra of the mid-level
[03:16:39.818 --> 03:16:43.361]  People that are progenerating all of this, or do you disagree with me, doctor?
[03:16:43.361 --> 03:16:45.843]  I mean, let's get down to brass tacks.
[03:16:45.843 --> 03:16:49.945]  Sure, you know, actually, as a matter of fact, we're not even authorized to tax.
[03:16:49.945 --> 03:16:59.252]  We're only authorized to collect fees that relate to the cost that we incur to inventory these emissions and to interact with other government agencies.
[03:16:59.252 --> 03:17:03.795]  But to have the measuring mechanism is the step to a tax, and a fee is a tax.
[03:17:04.443 --> 03:17:16.775]  Well, the great thing is that the measuring mechanisms we use to measure pollutants that everyone agrees are bad for human health are, in fact, the identical measurement techniques that allow us then to calculate greenhouse gas emissions.
[03:17:16.775 --> 03:17:23.102]  So, in fact, we don't have to put in place any new measurement techniques to provide this inventory.
[03:17:23.102 --> 03:17:26.345]  And that's why we're proud of the efficiency that we've brought to this process.
[03:17:27.964 --> 03:17:29.465]  The efficiency of this process.
[03:17:29.465 --> 03:17:38.431]  So what do you think about the British model, where they're all going to carry carbon cards that tracks... See, I have a problem with them also tracking and surveilling my purchases and what I do.
[03:17:38.431 --> 03:17:48.218]  They're talking about under socialized healthcare, what we eat's going to be tracked, and then, because we're all communally paying for it, and so I should have to pay more because I eat Blue Bell ice cream.
[03:17:48.218 --> 03:17:50.039]  I mean, where do you see all that going, Doctor?
[03:17:50.039 --> 03:17:52.361]  You know, that's certainly...
[03:17:53.553 --> 03:17:58.998]  That's a fascinating topic, and it extends so far beyond what the Air District is doing here.
[03:17:58.998 --> 03:18:10.248]  You're talking about measures that are meant to affect people's behavior, and so it's so important that I emphasize again that all we are doing here is helping provide the information.
[03:18:10.248 --> 03:18:12.831]  Wait a minute, the city banned bottled water in city buildings?
[03:18:13.869 --> 03:18:14.889]  Oh, that's true.
[03:18:14.889 --> 03:18:16.450]  Oh, you're not involved in behavior?
[03:18:16.450 --> 03:18:23.092]  And of course, that is a ritual through the behavioral psychologist to train you to be under control.
[03:18:23.092 --> 03:18:33.534]  People who normally wouldn't be under criminal jurisdiction to train us to have interaction with our new minders and bosses in England already going door-to-door, the children bossing the parents around.
[03:18:33.534 --> 03:18:39.956]  The CFR, sir, you may not have read it, says this is about enslaving us and says this is about control.
[03:18:39.956 --> 03:18:41.216]  They're so arrogant.
[03:18:41.216 --> 03:18:42.977]  And you know what the CFR is, don't you, doctor?
[03:18:43.587 --> 03:18:51.977]  You know, it's funny because living in San Francisco, I don't generally think of our population as being exorbitantly under control.
[03:18:51.977 --> 03:18:56.663]  Oh no, they don't care if you dress up like a woman and run around with your Johnson dragging the ground.
[03:18:56.663 --> 03:19:01.729]  But they don't want you to not vaccinate your children or own a firearm.
[03:19:04.042 --> 03:19:05.983]  Well, there are people with a variety of opinions on this.
[03:19:05.983 --> 03:19:12.386]  But see, that's the behavioral psychologist's control mechanism, is they give you pathetic, mindless rights that don't matter.
[03:19:12.386 --> 03:19:16.307]  But you understand, they make those your special goodies.
[03:19:16.307 --> 03:19:23.090]  But then if I try to demonstrate in most cities, I think San Francisco's more lenient there, with a sign saying, I'm against Bush, I get arrested.
[03:19:23.090 --> 03:19:26.592]  Because I'm in such a... And by the way, you know, Bush is now supporting the greenhouse tax.
[03:19:26.592 --> 03:19:27.212]  You know that, right?
[03:19:28.314 --> 03:19:34.036]  Well, he has acknowledged that, in fact, greenhouse gases emitted by human beings are affecting the climate.
[03:19:34.036 --> 03:19:34.797]  That is true.
[03:19:34.797 --> 03:19:37.178]  But you just said earlier the science is still out on that.
[03:19:37.178 --> 03:19:37.858]  One more segment.
[03:19:37.858 --> 03:19:39.159]  Quick break, Doctor.
[03:19:39.159 --> 03:19:40.679]  We really appreciate you coming on.
[03:19:40.679 --> 03:19:44.221]  I want you to tell me about other city programs like banning the water bottles.
[03:19:45.001 --> 03:19:47.863]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[03:19:47.863 --> 03:19:49.424]  Loose Change Final Cut.
[03:19:49.424 --> 03:19:51.586]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[03:19:51.586 --> 03:19:53.487]  The true story of the Bilderberg Group.
[03:19:53.487 --> 03:19:54.968]  The late great USA.
[03:19:54.968 --> 03:19:56.749]  America, freedom to fascism.
[03:19:56.749 --> 03:20:03.754]  These are just a few of the hundreds of powerful documentary films and books available at truthnews.us and prisonplanet.com.

[03:20:44.420 --> 03:20:47.301]  Listener, ask yourself, can I be deceived?
[03:20:47.301 --> 03:20:49.382]  Matthew 24 states four times.
[03:20:49.382 --> 03:20:51.703]  In the last days, many will be deceived.
[03:20:51.703 --> 03:20:55.264]  There are many ideas about the mark of the beast and the antichrist.
[03:20:55.264 --> 03:20:59.026]  What do you know about the beast, its mark, and the antichrist?
[03:20:59.026 --> 03:21:02.967]  Is the beast a superpower nation or a giant computer in Belgium?
[03:21:02.967 --> 03:21:07.009]  Is its mark an implanted chip, a tattoo, the national ID card, or 666?
[03:21:08.229 --> 03:21:08.549]  I think so.
[03:21:31.914 --> 03:21:33.376]  Box 99, Lenore City, Tennessee, 37771.
[03:21:33.376 --> 03:21:33.837]  Or call 888-211-1715.
[03:21:33.837 --> 03:21:34.178]  That's 888-211-1715.
[03:21:44.167 --> 03:21:45.408]  Hi, Ted Anders from Midas.
[03:21:45.408 --> 03:21:46.910]  May 29, 2008.
[03:21:46.910 --> 03:21:47.910]  Gold, $8.91.
[03:21:47.910 --> 03:21:53.896]  Hans Gold coins can be purchased for $9.17.90, $4.52.15 for half, $2.26.08 for quarter.
[03:21:53.896 --> 03:21:58.420]  That's $9.17.90, $4.52.15, and $2.26.08.
[03:21:58.420 --> 03:22:02.023]  For years, Ron Paul has taken the position to uphold constitutional rights.
[03:22:02.023 --> 03:22:06.607]  He's been branded by special interest groups as Dr. No, refusing to bend his values.
[03:22:06.607 --> 03:22:10.551]  I can only imagine the pressure applied by Congress as he stands alone for these principles.
[03:22:10.931 --> 03:22:13.251]  He has given up a medical career for this.
[03:22:13.251 --> 03:22:15.232]  Ron Paul is running for president.
[03:22:15.232 --> 03:22:21.493]  The ideas of strong currency, ending the war, defending the Constitution, and protecting civil liberties are catching on.
[03:22:21.493 --> 03:22:28.615]  As a thank you, GCNlive.com, Midas Resources, and I would like to send you a free copy of the Ron Paul Family Cookbook.
[03:22:28.615 --> 03:22:29.515]  Call 800-686-2237 for your free copy.
[03:22:29.515 --> 03:22:29.875]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[03:22:35.965 --> 03:22:39.193]  I hope his values are touching your heart as deep as they are mine.
[03:22:39.193 --> 03:22:39.574]  That's 800-686-2237.
[03:22:39.574 --> 03:22:41.178]  Thanks again for supporting Ron Paul.
[03:22:46.007 --> 03:22:51.049]  Do you want to know right now how you can drive around using water as fuel and laugh at rising gas costs?
[03:22:51.049 --> 03:22:53.330]  Then keep listening for a very special offer.
[03:22:53.330 --> 03:22:58.692]  GasFreedom.info has all the information you need to learn about a simple technology you can have right now.
[03:22:58.692 --> 03:23:02.433]  GasFreedom is a do-it-yourself, affordable, practical, free energy device.
[03:23:02.433 --> 03:23:06.715]  It uses a little electricity from your car's battery to separate water into a gas called HHO.
[03:23:07.575 --> 03:23:13.418]  HHO, also called Browns Gas, burns beautifully and provides tons of energy, while the end product is just water.
[03:23:13.418 --> 03:23:15.899]  Visit GasFreedom.info now to learn more.
[03:23:15.899 --> 03:23:18.881]  In just 10 minutes, you will discover exactly how this is possible.
[03:23:18.881 --> 03:23:22.162]  This is the secret the oil and auto industry doesn't want you to know.
[03:23:22.162 --> 03:23:26.825]  Go to GasFreedom.info to learn how very easy it is to extract energy from water to run your car.
[03:23:27.165 --> 03:23:29.687]  Go to gasfreedom.info for this special offer.

[03:23:32.109 --> 03:23:32.390]  That's 239-628-3708.
[03:23:32.390 --> 03:23:32.430]  239-628-3708.
[03:23:58.163 --> 03:24:01.186]  By the way, our money bomb has already exploded.
[03:24:01.186 --> 03:24:05.009]  Later, I'm gonna tell y'all how much has already poured in in the last few hours.
[03:24:05.009 --> 03:24:09.392]  Looks like it's gonna be bigger than I thought it was.
[03:24:09.392 --> 03:24:10.974]  Yeah, I'm takin' fight!
[03:24:10.974 --> 03:24:17.379]  Alright, I appreciate him comin' on.
[03:24:17.379 --> 03:24:20.822]  As we blast out on the M&FM dial.
[03:24:20.822 --> 03:24:23.664]  Global satellite, theinternetatinfowars.com.
[03:24:25.876 --> 03:24:30.398]  And Worldwide short-waved all the ships at sea.
[03:24:30.398 --> 03:24:35.580]  Jeffrey McKay, Deputy Air Pollution Officer.
[03:24:35.580 --> 03:24:39.381]  Alright, uh, there is a fortune to be made in all of this.
[03:24:39.381 --> 03:24:43.063]  They're estimating over a trillion dollars a year once it's implemented in Western Europe.
[03:24:43.969 --> 03:24:50.676]  And the United States as well as Canada, they're able to start taxing all of the different carbon emissions.
[03:24:50.676 --> 03:24:54.599]  Sir, so you said you could just talk to me about the carbon program.
[03:24:54.599 --> 03:24:59.544]  What's the time frame now as you measure carbon with this fee that's not a tax?
[03:24:59.544 --> 03:25:06.310]  And then how long till we hear what your people in city government are going to go forward with?
[03:25:06.310 --> 03:25:08.893]  So the fee will become effective on July 1st.
[03:25:10.169 --> 03:25:13.791]  And we regularly send out our permits.
[03:25:13.791 --> 03:25:18.453]  Again, this is a fee for facilities that we already regulate.
[03:25:18.453 --> 03:25:27.298]  The district's mission for over 50 years has been monitoring and regulating emissions from stationary sources in the Bay Area, so that means not cars and trucks.
[03:25:28.078 --> 03:25:36.385]  And so we're able to officially add this greenhouse gas fee to the permits that we send out to these folks already on a yearly basis.
[03:25:36.385 --> 03:25:37.325]  It's so easy!
[03:25:37.325 --> 03:25:38.767]  It's so small!
[03:25:38.767 --> 03:25:41.229]  Just let us set the precedent!
[03:25:41.229 --> 03:25:51.517]  Well, you know, actually, if this is the precedent, it would be a great precedent in terms of people saving money for inventorying greenhouse gas emissions.
[03:25:51.517 --> 03:25:54.379]  If the rest of the country could inventory their greenhouse gas emissions,
[03:25:54.975 --> 03:25:57.436]  At this price, that would be a wonderful thing.
[03:25:57.436 --> 03:25:58.556]  That's a great spin!
[03:25:58.556 --> 03:26:02.097]  Kind of like when they say in England, you all have your carbon slave card.
[03:26:02.097 --> 03:26:03.457]  It's going to make you money.
[03:26:03.457 --> 03:26:06.038]  Well, only if you live under a bridge, you can sell your credits that way.
[03:26:06.038 --> 03:26:08.038]  The average person is going to be paying huge amounts.
[03:26:08.038 --> 03:26:09.439]  You're doing something that costs money.
[03:26:09.439 --> 03:26:11.219]  You're saying it's not a tax, doctor.
[03:26:11.219 --> 03:26:11.899]  It is.
[03:26:11.899 --> 03:26:13.320]  It's to set everything up.
[03:26:13.320 --> 03:26:16.221]  And then now you're saying, oh, this would save money to inventory.
[03:26:16.221 --> 03:26:17.821]  Yeah, that's if we're going to adopt
[03:26:18.141 --> 03:26:27.946]  You know, if there is going to be any sort of tax or fee put in place that would incentivize people one way or another, it's so important that that be done from a basis of having a good understanding
[03:26:47.933 --> 03:26:58.604]  I understand that's a good talking point, Doc.
[03:26:58.604 --> 03:26:59.685]  Here's the deal.
[03:26:59.685 --> 03:27:06.632]  I would have Greenie Weenies on who don't care about the real environment just making money, we all know, or they're cult members.
[03:27:06.632 --> 03:27:07.794]  I would have them on this show
[03:27:08.733 --> 03:27:17.097]  And, uh, they would A, say carbon dioxide's a deadly, deadly thing, uh, B, they would then go on to say there's no plan for a tax, that I'm a big liar.
[03:27:17.097 --> 03:27:18.618]  Meanwhile, all their documents said it.
[03:27:18.618 --> 03:27:22.960]  Now the taxes are happening, and you're still saying it's not a tax.
[03:27:22.960 --> 03:27:28.143]  Well, I'm talking about what the Bay Area Air Quality Management District is doing here, and if- What's your calling it?
[03:27:28.143 --> 03:27:35.807]  If other, um, agencies do want to proceed with, uh, any sort of fee or tax that would be large enough to actually incentivize people,
[03:27:36.388 --> 03:27:38.949]  It's so important that it be done with the proper information.
[03:27:38.949 --> 03:27:40.871]  But a rose is still a rose by any other name.
[03:27:40.871 --> 03:27:43.392]  Is your fee a tax?
[03:27:43.392 --> 03:27:44.152]  No, no.
[03:27:44.152 --> 03:27:46.874]  It's actually a very clear definition.
[03:27:46.874 --> 03:27:48.915]  We're not authorized to issue taxes.
[03:27:48.915 --> 03:27:53.438]  We're only authorized to issue fees for cost recovery for work that we do.
[03:27:53.438 --> 03:28:01.302]  So the San Francisco Chronicle and the TV stations, they all got it wrong when they said greenhouse gas tax.
[03:28:01.302 --> 03:28:01.822]  That's correct.
[03:28:01.822 --> 03:28:02.563]  They should have said fee.
[03:28:04.344 --> 03:28:07.206]  Okay, well I'm beginning to understand now.
[03:28:07.206 --> 03:28:14.371]  Doctor, now just explain to me, though, Al Gore has said before Congress, it is a tax, what he's proposing, two different ones.
[03:28:14.371 --> 03:28:16.612]  Do you support that in the larger, just as a citizen?
[03:28:21.207 --> 03:28:25.870]  I am so focused on making sure the decisions are made with the best possible information.
[03:28:25.870 --> 03:28:32.613]  And so, at this stage of the game, you know, taking this first modest step, it's all about providing that information.
[03:28:32.613 --> 03:28:34.254]  That's exactly what we're doing.
[03:28:34.254 --> 03:28:38.716]  One small step for a man, one giant leap for slave masters worldwide.
[03:28:38.716 --> 03:28:40.977]  Well, that would be a large step.
[03:28:40.977 --> 03:28:43.299]  4.4 cents per ton.
[03:28:43.299 --> 03:28:49.362]  And that provides us with an inventory of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions in the Bay Area.
[03:28:50.186 --> 03:28:54.469]  Uh, which then can be used to make, hopefully, the best possible decision.
[03:28:54.469 --> 03:28:57.371]  And then that will fund the larger cadres of enforcers.
[03:28:57.371 --> 03:29:02.975]  Good God, all these control freak, gweenie weenies that are slicing tires all over Austin and knocking SUV windows out.
[03:29:02.975 --> 03:29:04.476]  God, they're gonna have badges and guns.
[03:29:04.476 --> 03:29:05.636]  It's gonna be hellish.
[03:29:05.636 --> 03:29:07.838]  Uh, give us the website for the city.
[03:29:07.838 --> 03:29:13.462]  Sure, the website for the Bay Area Air Quality Management District is B-A-A-Q-M-D.
[03:29:16.183 --> 03:29:17.744]  All right, Doc.
[03:29:17.744 --> 03:29:22.665]  Doc, I want to challenge you to go read about the Club of Rome, Richard and Haas, CFR documents.
[03:29:22.665 --> 03:29:28.827]  It's all a big fraud, all a big scam, and I don't think you mean bad, but I think you need to deprogram yourself and maybe get another job.
[03:29:28.827 --> 03:29:31.007]  Okay, Doc?
[03:29:31.007 --> 03:29:32.548]  You know it's too much money in it, right?
[03:29:32.548 --> 03:29:33.288]  Too powerful?
[03:29:33.288 --> 03:29:34.508]  Thank you for joining us.

[03:31:44.315 --> 03:31:48.077]  Hi, this is Alex Jones, and I want to talk to you about the high price of gasoline.
[03:31:48.077 --> 03:31:52.779]  It's no secret that gasoline quality is poor, even though we're paying record prices at the pump.
[03:31:52.779 --> 03:31:58.081]  I have run across a company called SFR, who has developed two products that improve gas mileage.
[03:31:58.081 --> 03:32:09.307]  Instead of paying a mechanic as much as $300 to clean your injection system, Protecta Complete Fuel System Treatment cleans to 95% of new engine condition, improving mileage in only one tank full.
[03:32:09.307 --> 03:32:11.668]  Protecta Engine Treatment not only reduces friction,
[03:32:12.088 --> 03:32:14.109]  But it extends the life of your engine.
[03:32:14.109 --> 03:32:15.030]  Let's face it.
[03:32:15.030 --> 03:32:17.872]  With the high price of gasoline, it's time to take action.
[03:32:17.872 --> 03:32:25.877]  Purchase a protective fuel system treatment for only $9.95 and receive a free engine treatment which is a $12.95 value free.
[03:32:25.877 --> 03:32:28.179]  Call 888-USE-SFR1.
[03:32:28.179 --> 03:32:31.801]  That number again is 888-USE-SFR1.
[03:32:31.801 --> 03:32:35.384]  Or check them out online at oilcompanysecret.com.
[03:32:35.384 --> 03:32:37.545]  That's oilcompanysecret.com.
[03:32:37.545 --> 03:32:39.907]  Satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[03:32:40.387 --> 03:32:41.808]  And it's safe for all cars.
[03:32:41.808 --> 03:32:48.571]  Act now.
[03:32:48.571 --> 03:32:49.392]  Guess what's happened?
[03:32:49.392 --> 03:32:58.636]  $15,000 has come in in the last few hours.
[03:33:06.792 --> 03:33:13.139]  And we haven't even gone through the mail yet that's pouring in this week for the Money Bomb.
[03:33:13.139 --> 03:33:18.585]  Starting tonight at midnight, we'll be posting the numbers as the
[03:33:20.865 --> 03:33:45.596]  Disgusting fiat currency pours in, and then we will take that filth, that evil, and through a process of InfoWars alchemy, it will come out the back end of this ICBM as propellant, as this missile lifts off the pad to destroy more of the enemy's lives.
[03:33:45.596 --> 03:33:48.497]  Guess what I learned during the little three-minute break?
[03:33:51.627 --> 03:33:56.210]  I just learned that I have a new tax here in Texas.
[03:33:56.210 --> 03:34:00.092]  About two years ago, somebody showed up threatening us, saying, you owe money.
[03:34:00.092 --> 03:34:04.234]  There's a new regional emergency tax for inventory, whatever everything's worth.
[03:34:04.234 --> 03:34:05.715]  You have to let me in.
[03:34:05.715 --> 03:34:06.436]  And I said, no.
[03:34:06.436 --> 03:34:07.676]  I said, give me some paperwork.
[03:34:07.676 --> 03:34:11.739]  I called, found out it was a new tax, had the little creature back.
[03:34:12.874 --> 03:34:15.415]  And they said, this file cabinet's worth $10,000.
[03:34:15.415 --> 03:34:18.576]  I'm like, that's a $200 file cabinet, maybe.
[03:34:18.576 --> 03:34:19.677]  This computer's worth $20,000.
[03:34:19.677 --> 03:34:24.559]  I'm like, no, that's like a four-year-old, maybe $800 computer when we bought it.
[03:34:24.559 --> 03:34:26.339]  I go on my taxes, I probably got that listed as $100.
[03:34:26.339 --> 03:34:28.360]  You know, it's been depreciated.
[03:34:28.360 --> 03:34:30.241]  This is worth that.
[03:34:30.241 --> 03:34:32.642]  You owe $20,000.
[03:34:32.642 --> 03:34:35.363]  They've got some inventory tax.
[03:34:35.363 --> 03:34:40.425]  And then some other bureaucrat last year just showed up banging on the door, let me in here, there's a new tax!
[03:34:41.252 --> 03:34:44.235]  Well, I've now been informed there's a new franchise tax.
[03:34:44.235 --> 03:34:45.937]  I remember hearing something about it.
[03:34:45.937 --> 03:34:49.260]  It's only 1% of our entire total gross.
[03:34:49.260 --> 03:34:53.464]  Of course, you know that'll be jacked up to 10, 15, 20%.
[03:34:53.464 --> 03:34:55.826]  There's cops everywhere, just everywhere, riding tickets.
[03:34:55.826 --> 03:34:57.327]  I mean, just every road, everywhere.
[03:34:57.327 --> 03:35:01.031]  Motorcycles, police cars, trucks, just feeding.
[03:35:01.923 --> 03:35:11.245]  Everybody's going bankrupt, falling apart, everything's gyrating up, they're building more prisons, more stations, more surveillance, drones, control, just frothing, enjoying themselves.
[03:35:11.245 --> 03:35:16.447]  Oh, it's so good!
[03:35:16.447 --> 03:35:22.448]  It's a good thing I don't care much about Federal Reserve notes, but see, as they jack the taxes up more and more and more, we won't even be able to operate soon.
[03:35:23.376 --> 03:35:25.417]  And people said, well, you should be 501c3.
[03:35:25.417 --> 03:35:27.659]  I actually had a millionaire call me up.
[03:35:27.659 --> 03:35:28.159]  Well-known.
[03:35:28.159 --> 03:35:28.839]  A lot of money.
[03:35:28.839 --> 03:35:29.540]  A lot more than a million.
[03:35:29.540 --> 03:35:30.220]  I don't want to say how much.
[03:35:30.220 --> 03:35:31.541]  They're like, I want to give you a bunch of money.
[03:35:31.541 --> 03:35:32.521]  And I said, well, take your time.
[03:35:32.521 --> 03:35:34.743]  Don't do that right now.
[03:35:34.743 --> 03:35:37.684]  You understand I'm not 501c3, and it's not going to be tax exempt.
[03:35:37.684 --> 03:35:40.386]  Your lawyers aren't going to like it.
[03:35:40.386 --> 03:35:42.347]  I just say that because it tortures other talk show hosts.
[03:35:42.347 --> 03:35:42.747]  That's right.
[03:35:42.747 --> 03:35:46.049]  I turned down money.
[03:35:46.049 --> 03:35:46.710]  I don't care.
[03:35:46.710 --> 03:35:47.250]  You understand?
[03:35:47.250 --> 03:35:48.731]  I really don't.
[03:35:48.731 --> 03:35:52.053]  I want enough money to live and take care of myself and operate.
[03:35:52.890 --> 03:35:56.091]  And I realize everybody else basically worships it.
[03:35:56.091 --> 03:36:03.292]  And, uh, to me, I just know it's not gonna matter soon because this is an economy where it's about you not being able to open a new business.
[03:36:03.292 --> 03:36:16.655]  It's about you not being able to operate unless you're a Fortune 500 that's in on the carbon tax scam and got good ol' boy backup hookups in the establishment with these international boards, and you're just not gonna have a business, you're not gonna have a job.
[03:36:16.655 --> 03:36:17.315]  Do you understand?
[03:36:17.315 --> 03:36:19.536]  This is a shift into total tyranny.
[03:36:19.536 --> 03:36:20.616]  Economic tyranny!
[03:36:21.684 --> 03:36:28.530]  Now, a lot of you think, no, it's about brown Al-Qaeda, and I'm a Nazi of the Ku Klux Klan, and I want to kill brown people.
[03:36:28.530 --> 03:36:31.512]  Well, let me tell you something, you racist dirtbags.
[03:36:31.512 --> 03:36:33.774]  This is for you.
[03:36:33.774 --> 03:36:35.295]  This is for you.
[03:36:35.295 --> 03:36:43.902]  I want to tell the racist Larry Conquistas, you call me a fat, uh, gringo pig on my own website, while calling me a racist.
[03:36:43.902 --> 03:36:45.904]  You racist, fat, gringo pig!
[03:36:45.904 --> 03:36:46.704]  Ha ha ha!
[03:36:46.704 --> 03:36:47.405]  Viva la Raza!
[03:36:48.433 --> 03:36:53.337]  No, I'm not the one talking about my race and how I'm going to take you over.
[03:36:53.337 --> 03:36:55.539]  You need to understand, you're losing too.
[03:36:55.539 --> 03:36:56.940]  The New World Order is getting you.
[03:36:56.940 --> 03:36:59.222]  They're poisoning your kids every day with the water.
[03:36:59.222 --> 03:37:00.843]  They're shooting them up every day.
[03:37:00.843 --> 03:37:15.075]  I want all the dumb white racists to know, all the Mexican racists, all the black racists to know, while you're all fighting with each other, the New World Order is going to town on you.
[03:37:15.075 --> 03:37:16.356]  Now, the news here.
[03:37:18.053 --> 03:37:27.776]  Is, uh, Steve Watson, incredible article, by the way, he has a PhD in political science, which normally are worthless, but Steve put his to use.
[03:37:27.776 --> 03:37:34.818]  Um, worst vaccine bill ever, seeks compulsory shots for all of the children.
[03:37:34.818 --> 03:37:37.939]  Activist group calls for defense of right to exemption in New York State.
[03:37:37.939 --> 03:37:42.700]  See, first they say, oh, well, there's no law, but we'd like you to fill out an exemption form.
[03:37:42.700 --> 03:37:45.981]  That then popularizes it's the law.
[03:37:45.981 --> 03:37:46.341]  Okay.
[03:37:47.535 --> 03:37:54.338]  And just like gun permits for concealed carry, there's no law you gotta have one to own a gun in Texas, but now people think that.
[03:37:54.338 --> 03:38:03.701]  Like New York started out with, yeah, you just got us $5 is what it started with in the 40s, just fill out a form, mail it in, and you got a gun permit.
[03:38:03.701 --> 03:38:05.502]  Okay?
[03:38:05.502 --> 03:38:11.825]  And it's just so we can get these illegals that are coming in from Europe, and you know, they got guns, and they're too dumb to do it, you know.
[03:38:11.825 --> 03:38:15.326]  And so they play the race card, like, yeah, we want that.
[03:38:16.112 --> 03:38:18.753]  And then now, nobody's got guns.
[03:38:18.753 --> 03:38:25.895]  Except the corrupt system and mob bosses who can pay 30 grand on average in political contributions to the sheriff or police chief to be authorized to have a gun.
[03:38:25.895 --> 03:38:27.935]  A right turns into a privilege.
[03:38:27.935 --> 03:38:42.859]  And so, uh, they tell you, I mean, you show up at the hospital now, they just take your kid's blood, and we've been telling you about it for a decade, now they admit, yeah, we take your blood and it goes to Homeland Security, before it was that, it goes to the FBI, and we also use it for genetic engineering.
[03:38:42.859 --> 03:38:43.179]  Period.
[03:38:44.292 --> 03:38:45.412]  And Bush signs a bill.
[03:38:45.412 --> 03:38:49.073]  We woken up people up, people got mad about it, it became a big issue at the state level.
[03:38:49.073 --> 03:38:54.655]  Bush just signed a federal bill three weeks ago saying, we'll take your blood at birth, DNA database.
[03:38:54.655 --> 03:38:58.275]  Doesn't matter, it was still crimes retroactively, what they did.
[03:38:58.275 --> 03:39:02.856]  It didn't protect them from the prior stuff, like his spy bill does.
[03:39:02.856 --> 03:39:03.677]  God, they're lawless.
[03:39:03.677 --> 03:39:07.858]  I mean, you start really thinking about how lawless this trash is.
[03:39:07.858 --> 03:39:13.179]  When you start really thinking about what they're doing, how they're operating, the things they're up to.
[03:39:14.549 --> 03:39:17.114]  I mean, it's just any criminal scam they can run, they're gonna do it.
[03:39:17.114 --> 03:39:17.815]  Now, let me explain.
[03:39:17.815 --> 03:39:18.756]  This is all eugenics.
[03:39:18.756 --> 03:39:21.401]  The carbon tax, the regulation, everything.
[03:39:21.401 --> 03:39:26.889]  And it's about giving total control to that one half of one percent.
[03:39:26.889 --> 03:39:28.793]  A pending New York State bill
[03:39:29.719 --> 03:39:48.034]  Dubbed the worst vaccine bill ever by one activist group, would see all vaccines, let's get them set up for Bermas next week when he's sitting in when I'm out of town, at Bilderberg, would see all vaccines recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and they add like five a year now, it's like 40-something, CDC made mandatory for all children, including infants and toddlers.
[03:39:48.769 --> 03:39:54.952]  God, they'll give your kid a shot, they'll have a seizure on the spot, and then they'll SWAT team you saying you shook the baby.
[03:39:54.952 --> 03:39:57.974]  Hey, that's their new little game they've been playing for about five years.
[03:39:57.974 --> 03:39:58.755]  Assembly Bill 10942.
[03:39:58.755 --> 03:40:03.377]  Think how sick they are.
[03:40:03.377 --> 03:40:06.479]  You got dumb cops brain damage themselves from shots their whole life.
[03:40:06.479 --> 03:40:08.160]  They just like drooling.
[03:40:08.160 --> 03:40:09.661]  Take your kid.
[03:40:09.661 --> 03:40:11.041]  Your kid had a seizure after the shot.
[03:40:11.041 --> 03:40:13.843]  You beat him up.
[03:40:13.843 --> 03:40:17.045]  Oh, beating them up puts micro lesions from mercury on their brain?
[03:40:18.425 --> 03:40:19.166]  Oh, it's not in there.
[03:40:19.166 --> 03:40:19.786]  Oh, it is in there.
[03:40:19.786 --> 03:40:20.487]  Oh, it's good for me.
[03:40:20.487 --> 03:40:21.227]  No, it's never been in there.
[03:40:21.227 --> 03:40:21.868]  Now it's out of there.
[03:40:21.868 --> 03:40:22.949]  Oh, it's actually in there.
[03:40:22.949 --> 03:40:25.590]  And it's caused brain damage, but we're going to make you take it.
[03:40:25.590 --> 03:40:39.861]  Introduced at the request of Richard Danes, the commissioner of New York State Department of Health, calls for changes to the law in order to make recommended inoculation, because see, the hoax, it's now been exposed that it was a hoax, and that was getting them about 95%.
[03:40:39.861 --> 03:40:41.142]  But now the hoax is over.
[03:40:41.142 --> 03:40:42.944]  The criminal's hoax is over.
[03:40:42.944 --> 03:40:43.624]  See?
[03:40:43.624 --> 03:40:44.785]  There's no law!
[03:40:44.785 --> 03:40:45.886]  They're criminals!
[03:40:47.398 --> 03:40:48.319]  What does it take?
[03:40:48.319 --> 03:40:55.664]  A government that lies all the time to you?
[03:40:55.664 --> 03:40:58.726]  I care about you, you idiot police.
[03:40:58.726 --> 03:41:00.428]  You idiot school teachers.
[03:41:00.428 --> 03:41:02.149]  You idiot Americans.
[03:41:02.149 --> 03:41:04.211]  Stop being idiots!
[03:41:04.211 --> 03:41:08.173]  Stop it!
[03:41:08.173 --> 03:41:10.655]  I've had hundreds of guests and scientists and doctors on.
[03:41:10.655 --> 03:41:12.237]  I've read all the source documents.
[03:41:12.237 --> 03:41:14.018]  I've played clips of the father of the
[03:41:14.870 --> 03:41:20.255]  Polio vaccine, admitting it had cancer viruses in it, and more, and AIDS, HIV.
[03:41:20.255 --> 03:41:21.015]  I've proven it.
[03:41:21.015 --> 03:41:22.256]  They're killing you, dude.
[03:41:22.256 --> 03:41:24.258]  Why do you want to die?
[03:41:24.258 --> 03:41:26.320]  Why do you want to believe their lies?
[03:41:26.320 --> 03:41:31.384]  What is your problem?
[03:41:31.384 --> 03:41:37.029]  What is your major malfunction?
[03:41:37.029 --> 03:41:42.474]  You want to thank God for me up here warning you that I've still got my head screwed on straight and I'm angry and upset.
[03:41:45.501 --> 03:41:48.843]  Folks, I have got as much instinct as a cow.
[03:41:48.843 --> 03:41:52.505]  Humans used to have the best instincts, the smartest, the most cunning, the best sixth sense.
[03:41:52.505 --> 03:41:54.126]  You've had it bred out of you.
[03:41:54.126 --> 03:41:54.907]  Engineered out of you.
[03:41:54.907 --> 03:41:56.408]  Poisoned out of you.
[03:41:56.408 --> 03:42:04.432]  You get a bunch of cows at the slaughterhouse, and that's why they get them in tiny squeeze chutes, and then only bring them into the main slaughter area one at a time.
[03:42:04.432 --> 03:42:06.634]  And most plants, and they usually got an air gun,
[03:42:07.558 --> 03:42:14.584]  Fires a bolt into their head because if you get other cows in there and they see that going on, they'll go nuts.
[03:42:14.584 --> 03:42:21.669]  Nuts like you've never seen, breaking their legs, ramming through things, doing things... A cow will fight back.
[03:42:21.669 --> 03:42:22.830]  And that's all I'm doing, folks.
[03:42:22.830 --> 03:42:28.975]  I'm in the chute, just slobbering and freaking out, and you're sitting there drooling like a bunch of idiots behind me.
[03:42:30.666 --> 03:42:45.613]  They got one cow up hanging by its legs in front of you, blood pouring out its neck, and huge pools, and you're just snickering, telling me that isn't one of our fellow cows getting their throat slit right in front of us, you idiots!
[03:42:45.613 --> 03:42:47.354]  God, I can't do it anymore.
[03:42:47.354 --> 03:42:48.114]  I can't.
[03:42:48.114 --> 03:42:49.355]  I want out of here.
[03:42:49.355 --> 03:42:52.276]  I want to go to some happy, friendly country where this isn't going on.
[03:42:52.276 --> 03:42:54.057]  There's evil going on all around you!
[03:42:54.057 --> 03:42:55.838]  They're feeding on your neighbors down the street!
[03:42:58.795 --> 03:43:06.463]  But you don't know your neighbors anymore, so you're not aware of what's happening.
[03:43:06.463 --> 03:43:10.708]  I get so mad reading this article, I just can't control myself.
[03:43:10.708 --> 03:43:12.290]  Oh, Jesus.
[03:43:12.290 --> 03:43:19.598]  Assembly Bill 10942 introduced at the... We're only a few years away from cops coming to your house and SWAT teaming you if you don't shoot your kids up.
[03:43:20.709 --> 03:43:22.971]  And I'm just telling the cops right now, you're pushing and pushing.
[03:43:22.971 --> 03:43:25.153]  The globalists know people are going to fight back.
[03:43:25.153 --> 03:43:27.775]  Then they're going to say, see, there is homegrown terrorism.
[03:43:27.775 --> 03:43:31.558]  And then you're going to all get your butts kicked and they're going to bring in foreign troops.
[03:43:31.558 --> 03:43:33.079]  You understand, you've pushed far enough.
[03:43:33.079 --> 03:43:36.522]  You slimeball, think you're tough punks.
[03:43:36.522 --> 03:43:49.613]  Assembly Bill 10942, introduced at the request of Richard Danes, the Commissioner of the New York State Department of Health, calls for changes to the law in order to make recommended inoculation compulsory in order for children to attend school.
[03:43:51.115 --> 03:43:57.680]  The bill would also permit the administration of vaccines for sexually transmitted infections to minors without parental consent.
[03:43:57.680 --> 03:44:01.603]  Now that is a huge... They're already taking your kids for abortions without your consent.
[03:44:01.603 --> 03:44:11.851]  Your 12 or 13 year old, in some cases as young as 10, they gotta have a letter to go to the zoo with the government training camp, but not to have a baby ripped out of them.
[03:44:14.428 --> 03:44:18.050]  And of course they're so lazy at the Planned Parenthood, half the time they leave an arm or a leg in there.
[03:44:18.050 --> 03:44:21.991]  I'm sorry to get the tale, and your daughter dies of some super fever.
[03:44:21.991 --> 03:44:22.732]  But you don't care!
[03:44:22.732 --> 03:44:24.473]  It's all part of being scum!
[03:44:24.473 --> 03:44:34.157]  You let the scum, filth, degenerate, viperous, murdering, trash, commie government just have its way with your kids while they train them to tattle on you and everything else!
[03:44:35.327 --> 03:44:45.638]  And you've had all your instincts sucked out of you, where you think a bunch of vampiric scumbag government leering over your children, the state stating in California's Supreme Court that the state owns your children.
[03:44:45.638 --> 03:44:47.800]  Remember that?
[03:44:47.800 --> 03:44:50.583]  And that homeschooling's illegal in California.
[03:44:50.583 --> 03:44:51.644]  You're out of control!
[03:44:51.644 --> 03:44:52.906]  The government's dirtbag!
[03:44:59.364 --> 03:45:05.809]  The bill would also permit the administration of vaccines for sexually transmitted infections to minors without parental consent.
[03:45:05.809 --> 03:45:16.656]  Merck, when they're not killing you with their Vioxx, they've got their, uh... Gardasil, which admittedly has killed a whole bunch of people and causes horrible autoimmune things that look like Ebola with blood pouring out of every orifice.
[03:45:16.656 --> 03:45:17.917]  Go read it.
[03:45:17.917 --> 03:45:18.578]  Had women on it.
[03:45:18.578 --> 03:45:19.919]  It's almost killed on this show.
[03:45:21.488 --> 03:45:23.769]  And, uh, it's been in the news it's killed a bunch.
[03:45:23.769 --> 03:45:30.954]  And then they say on the insert, go look it up on their own website, says it doesn't protect you from cancer, doesn't protect you from, from this type of virus.
[03:45:30.954 --> 03:45:33.775]  We think it might protect you from a few strains of 350.
[03:45:33.775 --> 03:45:36.197]  It might cover four to six.
[03:45:36.197 --> 03:45:41.900]  But if you already have the virus, which around half the population has of men and women,
[03:45:42.512 --> 03:45:45.114]  Then it gives you a 45% increase in cancer.
[03:45:45.114 --> 03:45:47.155]  Oh, they know it gives you cancer.
[03:45:47.155 --> 03:45:48.697]  But you're too stupid.
[03:45:48.697 --> 03:46:00.325]  You think the government gives you sweet milk and you sit there suckling off of its snake breast when you don't understand it's PURE DEATH!
[03:46:00.325 --> 03:46:06.730]  I have to watch my fellow humans march into the death camps in front of me!
[03:46:06.730 --> 03:46:07.971]  But it's all done
[03:46:09.190 --> 03:46:16.411]  In an orderly fashion of ignorance and moronicness, do you hear all the scientists and guests and New Old Order people I have on who I tear apart?
[03:46:16.411 --> 03:46:17.692]  And it's not because I'm smart.
[03:46:17.692 --> 03:46:18.692]  I understand the system.
[03:46:18.692 --> 03:46:19.412]  I study it.
[03:46:19.412 --> 03:46:20.232]  It's what I do.
[03:46:20.232 --> 03:46:22.112]  I know what I'm talking about.
[03:46:22.112 --> 03:46:29.374]  I've told you the truth and nothing but the truth!
[03:46:29.374 --> 03:46:34.715]  In fact, many times it is far worse than even I thought.
[03:46:34.715 --> 03:46:35.475]  God Almighty.
[03:46:38.208 --> 03:46:39.608]  And this is why I want to reach people.
[03:46:39.608 --> 03:46:41.249]  This is why I want to get out to more people.
[03:46:41.249 --> 03:46:54.032]  This is why I want to bust my butt and build a studio and do it myself and tape a TV show and try to get it on five nights a week on Dish Network because then we can hype it and get big listenership and have street teams out getting the word out.
[03:46:54.032 --> 03:46:57.413]  My God, if it was all paid for, I'd have no commercials on it.
[03:46:57.413 --> 03:46:59.033]  As it is, it'll probably have commercials.
[03:46:59.033 --> 03:47:00.374]  I need your help, man.
[03:47:00.374 --> 03:47:01.414]  I just want to warn people.
[03:47:01.414 --> 03:47:01.594]  Listen,
[03:47:02.398 --> 03:47:04.418]  You go warn people about how this stuff's killing them.
[03:47:04.418 --> 03:47:05.199]  You write articles.
[03:47:05.199 --> 03:47:07.539]  You go out and tell them, I just want to tell people!
[03:47:07.539 --> 03:47:11.360]  I just want to reach people!
[03:47:11.360 --> 03:47:16.841]  Because it's going to get worse, and worse, and worse, and worse, and worse, and worse, and worse.
[03:47:16.841 --> 03:47:18.561]  It isn't going to stop.
[03:47:18.561 --> 03:47:26.403]  I keep making the point, they do everything they said they were.
[03:47:26.403 --> 03:47:30.164]  They do everything they said they were going to do.
[03:47:30.164 --> 03:47:30.944]  Right down the line.
[03:47:31.803 --> 03:47:33.244]  They say they're going to do this, they do it.
[03:47:33.244 --> 03:47:37.068]  They say they're going to do it, and they've said... I've seen their whole battle plan.
[03:47:37.068 --> 03:47:48.278]  They admit what they're going to do, and up here it's killing 80-90% of us, flying over, spraying us in the end, killing us in mass, activating cancer systems they put in us, all this stuff.
[03:47:48.278 --> 03:47:52.162]  And they're already up to here, and I'm like, my God, they keep doing everything they say they're going to do.
[03:47:52.162 --> 03:47:53.383]  My God, they're really going to do it!
[03:47:53.383 --> 03:47:54.164]  My God!
[03:47:54.164 --> 03:47:55.525]  My God, warn people!
[03:48:01.491 --> 03:48:02.311]  And they're evil!
[03:48:02.311 --> 03:48:03.392]  They're so evil!
[03:48:03.392 --> 03:48:06.393]  And I just wish good people would wake up and fight back against this!
[03:48:06.393 --> 03:48:12.636]  I was screaming so loud earlier I tore something up my throat.
[03:48:12.636 --> 03:48:13.777]  I was coughing up blood earlier.
[03:48:15.731 --> 03:48:17.752]  It's because my soul is torn apart.
[03:48:17.752 --> 03:48:19.053]  I am just so angry.
[03:48:19.053 --> 03:48:20.855]  I don't have the strength or the will.
[03:48:20.855 --> 03:48:22.436]  I'm trying to push a rock up a hill.
[03:48:22.436 --> 03:48:23.256]  I need your help.
[03:48:23.256 --> 03:48:24.898]  I just want to warn people.
[03:48:24.898 --> 03:48:28.120]  I just want to arrest all these people that have done this.
[03:48:28.120 --> 03:48:30.502]  It's their own documents, their own treason.
[03:48:30.502 --> 03:48:34.104]  They all write books about how they're going to enslave us and how it's funny and how we're dumb.
[03:48:34.104 --> 03:48:43.010]  And then you just sit there laughing at me while they're laughing at you!
[03:48:43.010 --> 03:48:43.671]  I want to get them!
[03:48:46.861 --> 03:48:51.964]  I want to get people that want to get me.
[03:48:51.964 --> 03:48:58.089]  I don't go around looking for fights, but I sure as hell will stand up against somebody that starts one with me.
[03:48:58.089 --> 03:48:59.389]  And I've tried to get away from it.
[03:48:59.389 --> 03:49:00.650]  I've tried to run away.
[03:49:00.650 --> 03:49:02.672]  I've tried to tell myself it's going to be alright.
[03:49:02.672 --> 03:49:06.254]  I've tried to tell myself we're going to win and it's going to be okay, but not unless we put out a full effort.
[03:49:07.995 --> 03:49:09.176]  I've tried to avoid this.
[03:49:09.176 --> 03:49:10.556]  I've tried to deny this.
[03:49:10.556 --> 03:49:13.478]  This is something you can't run away from this.
[03:49:13.478 --> 03:49:14.898]  You don't have a choice.
[03:49:14.898 --> 03:49:16.439]  They're not going to stop coming.
[03:49:16.439 --> 03:49:18.180]  They're not going to stop pushing.
[03:49:18.180 --> 03:49:19.100]  They're organized.
[03:49:19.100 --> 03:49:19.861]  They're focused.
[03:49:19.861 --> 03:49:22.482]  They're coming to kill you.
[03:49:22.482 --> 03:49:25.703]  From the bottom of my heart, go research the facts.
[03:49:25.703 --> 03:49:30.045]  Research it all.
[03:49:30.045 --> 03:49:33.387]  The bill would also permit the administration of vaccines for sexually transmitted infections
[03:49:36.943 --> 03:49:39.124]  To minors without parental consent.
[03:49:39.124 --> 03:49:41.345]  God, that's the state becoming the parents.
[03:49:41.345 --> 03:49:47.389]  Separate sections of the bill will also come into effect next year, with others becoming law in 2010.
[03:49:47.389 --> 03:49:48.169]  So there you have it.
[03:49:48.169 --> 03:49:50.590]  No more, do you control your children or do they control it?
[03:49:50.590 --> 03:49:53.392]  The state, under the new eugenic social system, controls you.
[03:49:56.096 --> 03:50:18.153]  ACHAMP, a national nonpartisan political action organization formed by parents to support of children with neurodevelopmental and communication disorders, has called for rejection of the bill and is demanding the passage of A5468-S3031 in the Senate, a bill that would give individuals a right to a philosophical exemption.
[03:50:18.153 --> 03:50:20.335]  They don't have to give us, see, we already have the right.
[03:50:20.335 --> 03:50:22.396]  They're now claiming we don't have that right.
[03:50:22.396 --> 03:50:24.558]  The group's press release highlights the key points of the bill.
[03:50:25.698 --> 03:50:28.600]  My God.
[03:50:28.600 --> 03:50:31.301]  All children at birth will be injected.
[03:50:31.301 --> 03:50:33.643]  If you don't like it, a SWAT team will murder you.
[03:50:33.643 --> 03:50:35.484]  Yeah, you resist, they'll come kill you.
[03:50:35.484 --> 03:50:36.084]  All children.
[03:50:36.084 --> 03:50:36.944]  It's hell on earth.
[03:50:36.944 --> 03:50:38.305]  It's war against us.
[03:50:38.305 --> 03:50:44.429]  Eugenicists coming with their HIV-filled injectors, with their cancer-filled injectors, with their mercury-filled.
[03:50:44.429 --> 03:50:47.530]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[03:50:47.530 --> 03:50:51.953]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfate, sodium, formaldehyde?
[03:50:53.234 --> 03:51:00.239]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:51:00.239 --> 03:51:09.565]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[03:51:09.565 --> 03:51:11.406]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.
[03:51:11.406 --> 03:51:15.609]  All natural, earth-friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.
[03:51:15.609 --> 03:51:20.632]  They're safe, and you save 85% of the money you're spending on cleaning products now.
[03:51:20.632 --> 03:51:21.493]  Start saving over a
[03:51:21.493 --> 03:51:22.534]  Call 1-800-340-7091 for all your cleaning needs.
[03:51:44.326 --> 03:51:57.474]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[03:51:57.474 --> 03:52:01.296]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation.
[03:52:01.656 --> 03:52:08.540]  In which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[03:52:08.540 --> 03:52:11.942]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[03:52:11.942 --> 03:52:19.846]  From hijackers being trained at US military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.
[03:52:19.846 --> 03:52:27.090]  Secure your copy of Loose Change Final Cut today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com while you're visiting the online video store.
[03:52:27.310 --> 03:52:35.477]  Be sure to check out The Huge Distance on films like Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, America, Freedom to Fascism, and hundreds of other titles.
[03:52:35.477 --> 03:52:38.119]  We're in a no-holds-barred information war.
[03:52:38.119 --> 03:52:43.423]  Truth is our weapon, and PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[03:52:43.956 --> 03:52:46.057]  My cracked heels were always my nemesis.
[03:52:46.057 --> 03:52:50.600]  All my life, I've had dry heels and rough, thickened skin on the soles and sides of my feet.
[03:52:50.600 --> 03:52:53.582]  Then my podiatrist told me about Kallax Ointment.
[03:52:53.582 --> 03:52:57.925]  I am amazed how fast and efficient this product is at softening the hard spots.
[03:52:57.925 --> 03:53:03.429]  Since using Kallax, the split and cracked skin on my heels is gone, leaving them smooth and healthy-looking.
[03:53:03.429 --> 03:53:06.531]  I'm so grateful and no longer embarrassed in sandals.
[03:53:06.531 --> 03:53:09.753]  If you have dry, cracked feet, I recommend Kallax Ointment.
[03:53:09.753 --> 03:53:13.776]  You'll find it in the foot care section at drugstores, mass retailers, and supercenters.
[03:53:15.137 --> 03:53:18.079]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[03:53:18.079 --> 03:53:20.721]  Mine found it, in precious metals.
[03:53:20.721 --> 03:53:24.524]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[03:53:24.524 --> 03:53:31.789]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.
[03:53:31.789 --> 03:53:34.370]  Find your answer at Midas Resources.
[03:53:34.370 --> 03:53:34.631]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[03:53:34.631 --> 03:53:35.091]  The answer is at 1-800-686-2237.
[03:54:01.104 --> 03:54:07.448]  There's only maybe 2% of the population that knows they're poisoning the water and food and vaccines by design.
[03:54:07.448 --> 03:54:13.071]  They're counting on you to be too cowardly to admit the truth.
[03:54:13.071 --> 03:54:15.952]  Because it's scary to admit it and find it out.
[03:54:15.952 --> 03:54:21.475]  To not just let me be some nut on the radio, but to go look at the claims I've made.
[03:54:21.475 --> 03:54:22.596]  Find out they're killing you.
[03:54:22.596 --> 03:54:25.718]  Because then you're gonna have a job to do.
[03:54:25.718 --> 03:54:28.759]  You're gonna have to fight back against these people.
[03:54:30.785 --> 03:54:44.854]  But make no mistake, those of you that have committed the genocide, those of you that got 40 million dead Africans on your hands, you're gonna pay one day.
[03:54:44.854 --> 03:54:47.976]  You're gonna swing from the end of a rope.
[03:54:47.976 --> 03:54:51.538]  You know why?
[03:54:51.538 --> 03:54:55.840]  Because you keep pushing, and you never stop.
[03:54:55.840 --> 03:54:59.683]  And you're gonna push us up against a wall where a lot of these cowardly, dumbed-down people
[03:55:00.620 --> 03:55:05.183]  Aren't going to have any opportunity but to fight back.
[03:55:05.183 --> 03:55:06.884]  We're going to kick your butt.
[03:55:06.884 --> 03:55:10.567]  A lot of us are going to die in the process.
[03:55:10.567 --> 03:55:12.929]  But in the end, you're going down.
[03:55:12.929 --> 03:55:14.049]  Know that.
[03:55:14.049 --> 03:55:19.613]  And your family names and dynasties will be synonymous with evil in the dictionary.
[03:55:19.613 --> 03:55:20.314]  I'm out of time.
[03:55:20.314 --> 03:55:21.595]  I want to thank all you, the listeners.
[03:55:21.595 --> 03:55:23.736]  Retransmission starts in a few minutes at InfoWars.com.
[03:55:25.493 --> 03:55:33.055]  Until I'm back live Saturday for a special InfoWars.com Money Bomb from 8 to midnight Central Time.
[03:55:33.055 --> 03:55:39.156]  $15,000 plus and growing has come into the PayPal since today.
[03:55:39.156 --> 03:55:41.777]  This is not the Money Bomb Day that people are already getting.
[03:55:41.777 --> 03:55:44.818]  And so it looks like it's going to be huge.
[03:55:44.818 --> 03:55:47.398]  And we will put it all into the fight against the New World Order.
[03:55:47.398 --> 03:55:52.459]  There will be a toll-free number up this evening for you as well, starting at midnight.
[03:55:52.459 --> 03:55:53.840]  It'll be up there earlier than that.
[03:55:53.840 --> 03:55:54.780]  Is the toll-free number up yet?
[03:55:55.859 --> 03:56:03.864]  We need to get that up, because I need to go and get that, because people know what it is in case they, some people won't have internet access later, or some people need to give this to others that don't have internet access.
[03:56:03.864 --> 03:56:04.925]  Well, what is the 1-800 number?
[03:56:04.925 --> 03:56:09.088]  Maybe I'll just give it out to people, so they, a lot of my listeners, I forgot about that also.
[03:56:09.088 --> 03:56:09.328]  It's 888-201-2244, 888-201-2244.
[03:56:16.420 --> 03:56:19.442]  That's 888-201-2244.
[03:56:19.442 --> 03:56:24.145]  That's not open right now, but it will be at midnight tonight, Central, 888-201-2244.
[03:56:24.145 --> 03:56:30.590]  For those listening on satellite, global shortwave, AM or FM that may not have, way to do it.
[03:56:30.590 --> 03:56:32.791]  But we can't just rely on these money bombs.
[03:56:32.791 --> 03:56:37.274]  We also have sponsors, and in closing, I haven't plugged these today, Interfood and Aloeiz.
[03:56:37.274 --> 03:56:41.557]  Interfood is the best green food out there that I have found, bar none, anywhere.
[03:56:42.987 --> 03:56:45.809]  And we're not like the government, telling you you've got to take shots filled with poison.
[03:56:45.809 --> 03:56:47.050]  We're just saying, hey, here's some good green food.
[03:56:47.050 --> 03:56:49.972]  What do you think is great to combat all this poison?
[03:56:49.972 --> 03:56:59.138]  And their number is 866-762-9238, 866-762-9238, or interfood.com, interfood.com.

[03:57:05.323 --> 03:57:06.103]  These aren't vitamins.
[03:57:06.103 --> 03:57:09.786]  These are the raw form of the vitamins and nutrients for total absorption.

[03:57:29.210 --> 03:57:35.194]  They just sell what is well-known and documented to be excellent and to be helpful to the body.

[03:58:40.193 --> 03:58:42.554]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[03:58:42.554 --> 03:58:45.675]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[03:58:45.675 --> 03:58:51.417]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
