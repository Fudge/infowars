[00:00.000 --> 00:24.160]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:24.160 --> 00:35.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Monday, April 17, 2017, I'm your host Alex Jones, Paul Joseph
[00:35.320 --> 00:40.080]  Watson will be hosting from the main studio in about 15-20 minutes with Mike Cernovich
[00:40.080 --> 00:41.080]  and others.
[00:41.080 --> 00:46.160]  Now, we're facing the greatest threat, not just the existence of Info Wars, but the free
[00:46.160 --> 00:48.000]  speech in this country.
[00:48.000 --> 00:51.520]  You've seen the mainstream news articles admitting Google and others planned to shut down the
[00:51.520 --> 00:56.400]  new right libertarians, nationalists, not just here, but all over Europe and other parts
[00:56.400 --> 01:01.240]  of the world who are standing up to the unelected authoritarian system of globalism.
[01:01.240 --> 01:06.160]  Now, we can put on screen, Mike Cernovich has been around for years, but he's one of
[01:06.160 --> 01:11.000]  the top bloggers now in the world because he has such amazing sources inside the Trump
[01:11.000 --> 01:12.440]  administration and more.
[01:12.440 --> 01:17.760]  There it is from Fox News, pro-Trump blogger Cernovich getting big scoops mainstream media
[01:17.760 --> 01:22.160]  attention and they have to admit, okay, these are big scoops.
[01:22.160 --> 01:29.080]  Now, Cernovich came to Austin to visit with us and we were doing a broadcast about censorship
[01:29.080 --> 01:34.480]  and he was sent by his Google insider of five years and I've seen the intel, I've seen
[01:34.480 --> 01:41.600]  them text messages, I've seen the basic identity to document this, of the internal Google order
[01:41.600 --> 01:49.480]  and memorandum that represents absolute total fraud and absolute criminal activity against
[01:49.480 --> 01:52.160]  myself and against the American people in free speech.
[01:52.160 --> 01:59.160]  It is true racketeering in the very essence and sense of it from our research.
[01:59.160 --> 02:07.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, they direct their contractors to go vote us down and then they say, oh, but
[02:07.440 --> 02:09.320]  this is all free, fair and open.
[02:09.320 --> 02:11.600]  Again, a total fraud on his face.
[02:11.600 --> 02:17.480]  They then misrepresent what we say and what we do and say that we're not credible playing
[02:17.480 --> 02:24.360]  clips of Ron Paul, Vladimir Putin and Assad saying that the Syrian gas attack was probably
[02:24.360 --> 02:26.240]  a false flag.
[02:26.240 --> 02:30.160]  In our article they list, they say we give no proof.
[02:30.160 --> 02:38.960]  We list Sky Television and other mainstream news outlets with the interviews.
[02:38.960 --> 02:44.680]  So understand, we're being delisted and blocked and put into an electronic gulag that Matt
[02:44.680 --> 02:49.680]  Drugs warned about, and I'm going to go over the internal documents when we come back and
[02:49.680 --> 02:57.840]  break these here on air, saying that we're not showing our sources when we are showing
[02:57.840 --> 02:58.840]  our sources.
[02:58.840 --> 03:03.960]  And then they go on and say, CNN is a good news source.
[03:03.960 --> 03:08.520]  Many of you are going to ask why are you banning info wars when CNN had the very same headline
[03:08.520 --> 03:14.880]  and they go on to say, well, CNN's popular and liked, and they showed other commentary.
[03:14.880 --> 03:20.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, in the article they list, we have Sky News, U-Namen and other MSM
[03:20.960 --> 03:23.000]  that we're actually linking to.
[03:23.000 --> 03:25.800]  Of course Putin saying it's a false flag is newsworthy.
[03:25.800 --> 03:28.200]  Of course Assad saying it's a false flag is newsworthy.
[03:28.200 --> 03:30.920]  Of course Ron Paul saying it's a false flag is newsworthy.
[03:30.920 --> 03:35.560]  They say we are to be delisted, and I have the quotes, we're going to come back from
[03:35.560 --> 03:37.000]  break and cover these.
[03:37.000 --> 03:44.240]  They say that we're going to be delisted because if you read right here, compare this info
[03:44.240 --> 03:51.280]  wars article, it's brief and only mentioned statements, sources, not really typical.
[03:51.280 --> 03:56.240]  Putin, former Congressman Ron Paul and Assad, which seem to be making the same case here
[03:56.240 --> 04:02.240]  that bolsters the sites previously held perspectives, which cut against the grain to say the least.
[04:02.240 --> 04:03.240]  Wow.
[04:03.240 --> 04:04.240]  Wow.
[04:04.240 --> 04:13.560]  So I play clips from Sky Television, from our team, and from the BBC, right here, chemical
[04:13.560 --> 04:17.960]  attack fabricated Assad.
[04:17.960 --> 04:22.160]  Business Insider Putin, US planning false flag attacks in Syria to frame Assad for chemical
[04:22.160 --> 04:23.160]  weapons.
[04:23.160 --> 04:30.640]  Understand, they're saying we're discredited, and we're banned, and we're going to be removed
[04:30.640 --> 04:37.600]  because we previously said there were fake chemical attacks, and now world leaders were
[04:37.600 --> 04:43.160]  agreeing with us and calling for an investigation because we were right, we're bad.
[04:43.160 --> 04:45.120]  Because we trailblazed, we're bad.
[04:45.120 --> 04:49.640]  Because we had military sources on in 2013 and last year, when the rebels got caught
[04:49.640 --> 04:54.840]  doing it, and Sy Hersh has come out, and the UN has come out, that's why we're bad, that's
[04:54.840 --> 04:55.840]  why we're banned.
[04:55.840 --> 04:56.840]  We'll be right back.
[04:56.840 --> 04:59.360]  Stay with us.
[04:59.360 --> 05:00.800]  You have no money?
[05:00.800 --> 05:02.960]  This is okay, we will take your blood.
[05:02.960 --> 05:08.720]  If you want access to the Vatican museums, cash, visa, mastercard, or needle is accepted.
[05:08.720 --> 05:12.200]  That's right, you can give blood to access the Vatican Museum.
[05:12.200 --> 05:17.120]  The blood payment plan has a slogan, give blood and follow your artistic inclination.
[05:17.120 --> 05:20.600]  Blood donors then receive a voucher, which gives them access to the museums.
[05:20.600 --> 05:24.920]  The director of the Vatican Museum said, without blood, there is no life.
[05:24.920 --> 05:27.680]  Without art, life would be empty and sad.
[05:27.680 --> 05:28.680]  Okay.
[05:28.680 --> 05:29.680]  We love Jesus too.
[05:29.680 --> 05:30.680]  Happy Easter.
[05:30.680 --> 05:32.760]  I guess this is a good idea.
[05:32.760 --> 05:35.800]  Get some blood donations and allow people access to history.
[05:35.800 --> 05:40.320]  Sounds harmless, but wait, each blood donation is good for a four-year-old voucher.
[05:40.320 --> 05:43.440]  It costs 16 euros to access the museums.
[05:43.440 --> 05:47.160]  So you have to donate blood four times before you can even get in.
[05:47.160 --> 05:50.560]  By the time you've given enough blood, you'd have fainted.
[05:50.560 --> 05:55.080]  Enjoy Michelangelo's Last Judgment as you recover from hypovolemia.
[05:55.080 --> 05:59.720]  For Infowars.com, this is Owen Schreuer.
[05:59.720 --> 06:01.080]  This is Alex Jones.
[06:01.080 --> 06:05.440]  I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money on one of the best new off-the-grid
[06:05.440 --> 06:06.440]  products of 2017.
[06:06.440 --> 06:09.560]  And seriously, I really think everyone should have one of these.
[06:09.560 --> 06:13.200]  I'm talking about the PPX Solar Generator System from our friends at Solutions from
[06:13.200 --> 06:15.480]  Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[06:15.480 --> 06:19.680]  The PPX is so small, you can put it in your pocket, but so powerful, you can run some
[06:19.680 --> 06:24.560]  110 appliances at your house, like a small refrigerator so you can keep food from spoiling.
[06:24.560 --> 06:28.920]  Plus, you can take it with you to jumpstart cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, heavy equipment,
[06:28.920 --> 06:29.920]  even airplanes.
[06:29.920 --> 06:34.160]  The system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity, allowing you to create your own
[06:34.160 --> 06:37.200]  private power grid, literally anywhere in the world.
[06:37.200 --> 06:42.000]  Perfect for cabins, remote locations, any time you need to get off the grid for a while.
[06:42.000 --> 06:45.360]  Go to privatepowergrid.com to watch this thing in action.
[06:45.360 --> 06:47.440]  That's privatepowergrid.com.
[06:47.440 --> 06:53.200]  Even better, use coupon code PRIVATE at checkout and get a second PPX Energy Unit for free.
[06:53.200 --> 06:55.640]  Check it out at privatepowergrid.com.
[06:55.640 --> 06:58.960]  That's privatepowergrid.com.
[06:58.960 --> 07:01.080]  We didn't ask for this fight, but we're in this fight.
[07:01.080 --> 07:02.080]  This is the time to support InfoWars.
[07:02.080 --> 07:05.120]  We've had an Easter special, and I've decided to extend for another week.
[07:05.120 --> 07:09.840]  It is a great, empowering thing for me personally, big under Global Sunslut, and as the enemy
[07:09.840 --> 07:13.320]  turns up the wattage, every action has an opposite equal reaction.
[07:13.320 --> 07:16.160]  God, or the good force in the universe, turns up my power.
[07:16.160 --> 07:17.400]  So, let me explain something.
[07:17.400 --> 07:20.280]  This is a great voyage I'm on, and I know you're on it with me.
[07:20.280 --> 07:24.920]  The animating contest of Liberty that Thomas Jefferson talked about is the Paramount Vehicle.
[07:24.920 --> 07:29.840]  This whole world is a test, and this experiment that we're all part of is key.
[07:29.840 --> 07:33.320]  You're conscious and alive, and you care, and the fact that you're even involved and
[07:33.320 --> 07:37.280]  are even searching for the truth shows you're conscious and haven't been pulled under by
[07:37.280 --> 07:39.440]  these dark forces that now dominate our world.
[07:39.440 --> 07:42.360]  So whether you get our great products and support the broadcast, whether you pray for
[07:42.360 --> 07:44.920]  us, whether you just spread the word about the links, it doesn't matter.
[07:44.920 --> 07:48.120]  Just being conscious and awake connects us all together, and this is an incredible moment
[07:48.120 --> 07:49.120]  to be alive.
[07:49.120 --> 07:52.960]  This is Thomas with the entire InfoWars.com family, InfoWarsLive.com, saluting all of
[07:52.960 --> 07:55.720]  you, no matter what color your skin is, where you came from in the world, or what your religious
[07:55.720 --> 08:00.200]  background is, we are unstoppable together.
[08:00.200 --> 08:06.480]  It is Monday, the 17th, the day of April, 2017, I'm your host Alex Jones, Paul Joseph
[08:06.480 --> 08:10.360]  Watson, and Mike Cernovich, and others are coming up for the main studio here in just
[08:10.360 --> 08:13.440]  about 10 minutes or so.
[08:13.440 --> 08:19.200]  We obviously have the vice president making a rare visit to the DMZ in South Korea.
[08:19.200 --> 08:25.440]  We have major escalations there with the head of the National Security Council saying that
[08:25.440 --> 08:27.000]  North Korea is coming to a head.
[08:27.000 --> 08:30.200]  All of this is going to be broken down here today.
[08:30.200 --> 08:33.360]  I think it's a big victory that North Korea didn't test a nuke.
[08:33.360 --> 08:35.960]  Clearly, they've backed down to Trump so far.
[08:35.960 --> 08:36.960]  That's unprecedented.
[08:36.960 --> 08:39.160]  We're going to be breaking that down today.
[08:39.160 --> 08:44.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, there is an attempt to strangle InfoWars, and MSM even admits
[08:44.920 --> 08:48.000]  if they're successful with us, they'll be able to shut down Drudge, they'll be able
[08:48.000 --> 08:49.640]  to shut down everybody else.
[08:49.640 --> 08:52.560]  That's why I rarely ask Drudge to cover a story.
[08:52.560 --> 08:57.160]  He covers our stories without us asking, but I am asking Drudge to link to the story on
[08:57.160 --> 08:58.160]  InfoWars.com.
[08:58.160 --> 09:02.880]  Dr. Corsi is also expanding on Mike Cernovich's breaking news.
[09:02.880 --> 09:07.280]  We can put Fox News on screen for you that Mike Cernovich is very respected because he's
[09:07.280 --> 09:10.840]  broken so many stories that end up to be absolutely on target.
[09:10.840 --> 09:12.480]  I happen to know some of his sources.
[09:12.480 --> 09:13.960]  They are in the White House.
[09:13.960 --> 09:17.440]  Cernovich is quite frankly better than I am at working the sources.
[09:17.440 --> 09:18.440]  There it is.
[09:18.440 --> 09:22.840]  Pro-Trump blogger, Cernovich, getting big scoops, mainstream media attention.
[09:22.840 --> 09:23.840]  That's Fox News.
[09:23.840 --> 09:30.240]  And the reason I raise that is that the media says we're fake, we're not real because we
[09:30.240 --> 09:31.440]  are on target.
[09:31.440 --> 09:35.800]  Now, sometimes I engage in satire on air, and it's very clear when it's satire, and
[09:35.800 --> 09:38.840]  the media takes it out of context and says, do you really mean this?
[09:38.840 --> 09:45.000]  And I say, no, I'm illustrating what I'm doing using humor, using satire.
[09:45.000 --> 09:49.480]  And I always tell you when I'm doing it, when I'm doing that as, quote, an actor.
[09:49.480 --> 09:55.080]  But what I say and do on air as Alex Jones, what I stand for, our philosophies of the
[09:55.080 --> 09:59.960]  Second Amendment, sovereignty, that's who I am in my total core.
[09:59.960 --> 10:02.640]  And we've changed the world together.
[10:02.640 --> 10:08.280]  And I've never seen such a barrage, thousands of articles the last week, hundreds today,
[10:08.280 --> 10:12.600]  with the most upside down twisted garbage that I've ever seen.
[10:12.600 --> 10:18.800]  Now, Mike Cernovich, breathlessly last night, called me and said, can you meet?
[10:18.800 --> 10:19.800]  He was in town.
[10:19.800 --> 10:21.160]  You already been on the show Friday.
[10:21.160 --> 10:22.160]  I said, sure.
[10:22.160 --> 10:23.160]  Went down to that.
[10:23.160 --> 10:25.760]  He and his wife, Buckley, and others went with me.
[10:25.760 --> 10:26.760]  And he said, look at this.
[10:26.760 --> 10:31.480]  And he showed me the source, showed me the information inside Google, showed me his
[10:31.480 --> 10:33.200]  text with a guy going back years.
[10:33.200 --> 10:35.520]  This is a really good source of his.
[10:35.520 --> 10:42.120]  Inside a major Google contracting company, Cernovich has some amazing contacts.
[10:42.120 --> 10:44.200]  We were talking to some of them last night.
[10:44.200 --> 10:45.720]  Some of them are billionaires in the tech world.
[10:45.720 --> 10:47.000]  I'll just leave it at that.
[10:47.000 --> 10:50.800]  And they're really concerned about what's happening.
[10:50.800 --> 11:00.000]  And so Google has taken out a major contract to delist infowars.com from its search engine.
[11:00.000 --> 11:03.600]  And earlier in the last segment, I called what they're doing criminal, when a big multinational
[11:03.600 --> 11:12.240]  company organizes people secretly and pays them to go bury someone artificially.
[11:12.240 --> 11:16.640]  And then claims that their search algorithm is real when they actually are hiring people
[11:16.640 --> 11:17.720]  to manipulate it.
[11:17.720 --> 11:20.080]  That is fraud against the public.
[11:20.080 --> 11:24.720]  The Washington Post three months ago had to retract their fake news list that had myself
[11:24.720 --> 11:27.360]  and others in it because people started filing suit on them.
[11:27.360 --> 11:30.680]  You just can't say we're all fake news and delist us.
[11:30.680 --> 11:36.880]  So in their crafty little letter that's on infowars.com, went out to all Google contractors
[11:36.880 --> 11:39.360]  in their search engine system.
[11:39.360 --> 11:43.800]  It says, now we can't say he's fake because he can sue us, but you just take matters in
[11:43.800 --> 11:47.880]  your own hands, but you will say medium or poor.
[11:47.880 --> 11:51.240]  You will say lower medium.
[11:51.240 --> 11:56.360]  So it's all written by lawyers, but it's so good to have it internally to see how they're
[11:56.360 --> 11:57.360]  doing it.
[11:57.360 --> 12:00.560]  And here's where it gets incredible because they can shut us up.
[12:00.560 --> 12:01.560]  They can shut you up.
[12:01.560 --> 12:03.960]  Here's where it gets amazing.
[12:03.960 --> 12:11.080]  They list the fact that I list Ron Paul as a source and they say Ron Paul is not credible
[12:11.080 --> 12:17.560]  and that that is the grounds for us when Ron Paul said two weeks ago, the day after the
[12:17.560 --> 12:22.600]  chemical attack that the rebels got caught before he gave the source of the UN report.
[12:22.600 --> 12:24.360]  It was all over mainstream news.
[12:24.360 --> 12:26.040]  And who would benefit?
[12:26.040 --> 12:27.040]  It makes no sense.
[12:27.040 --> 12:32.480]  Even if you were totally separate from this and take no size of this and you were just
[12:32.480 --> 12:37.120]  an analyst, it doesn't make any sense for Saud and these conditions to all of a sudden
[12:37.120 --> 12:40.040]  use poison gases.
[12:40.040 --> 12:46.800]  I think it's zero chance that he would have done this deliberately and he's doing this
[12:46.800 --> 12:47.800]  now.
[12:47.800 --> 12:53.040]  In 2013, then again in 2016, they got caught launching a chemical attack.
[12:53.040 --> 12:55.520]  This is all over mainstream news.
[12:55.520 --> 12:58.440]  Ron Paul's crime as he has a memory.
[12:58.440 --> 13:00.240]  Then Putin came out and said it.
[13:00.240 --> 13:06.680]  We have information from various sources that a similar provocation and I can't call it
[13:06.680 --> 13:11.200]  anything other than a provocation is being prepared in other parts of Syria, including
[13:11.200 --> 13:17.280]  the southern suburbs of Damascus, where they're again prepared to lease some similar chemical
[13:17.280 --> 13:21.960]  substances and accuse the Syrian authorities of using them.
[13:21.960 --> 13:25.880]  Even Assad said it, Sy Hersh has said it, Pulitzer Prize winner.
[13:25.880 --> 13:31.680]  They say that because we wrote an article and use Ron Paul as a source, that it was
[13:31.680 --> 13:32.680]  uncredible.
[13:32.680 --> 13:37.440]  Then they say, but you're asking why the CNN have the same headline false flag.
[13:37.440 --> 13:41.240]  They said, well, they're credible and respected and people like them.
[13:41.240 --> 13:45.480]  It actually says this because people like CNN, which is a total lie.
[13:45.480 --> 13:47.880]  They have a 6% approval rating.
[13:47.880 --> 13:49.880]  They're known to be one of the most untrusted groups.
[13:49.880 --> 13:54.400]  They got caught in WikiLeaks with Google, with the White House, with Hillary fixing
[13:54.400 --> 13:55.400]  search results.
[13:55.400 --> 13:57.000]  Remember all that?
[13:57.000 --> 13:58.440]  Remember all that?
[13:58.440 --> 14:00.080]  So they're the fraud.
[14:00.080 --> 14:01.080]  They're the fake garbage.
[14:01.080 --> 14:04.360]  They're the ones that gave us the fake polls and gave Hillary the questions beforehand
[14:04.360 --> 14:07.360]  and got caught doing all of it.
[14:07.360 --> 14:14.920]  And so they actually say because we use Ron Paul and they say, for us to say he's low
[14:14.920 --> 14:17.400]  or medium, that's a little kind.
[14:17.400 --> 14:19.800]  You probably want to go more negative.
[14:19.800 --> 14:23.640]  So clearly, I've got big lawyers in DC that already want to do something previously and
[14:23.640 --> 14:27.560]  I'm just too busy getting the news out, but we all have to stand up legally.
[14:27.560 --> 14:28.960]  The White House has to stand up.
[14:28.960 --> 14:32.320]  They're strangling the search results for what President Trump says and does.
[14:32.320 --> 14:36.720]  The Democrats are on the news telling Google to strangle results and do this.
[14:36.720 --> 14:39.640]  This is communist Chinese style control.
[14:39.640 --> 14:46.040]  Let me, if you're a radio listener, read to you what it says from their bounty that's
[14:46.040 --> 14:47.040]  gone out.
[14:47.040 --> 14:51.800]  On the screen, the infowars.com article that they say doesn't show any credible sources.
[14:51.800 --> 14:58.160]  It has a link to Sky News, it has a link to a bunch of other mainstream video clips of
[14:58.160 --> 15:03.800]  world leaders saying, Vladimir Putin saying, others saying it's a false flag.
[15:03.800 --> 15:08.680]  Let's suppose we have this arsenal and let's suppose that we have the will to use it.
[15:08.680 --> 15:13.400]  Why didn't we use it when we were treating and the transfer advancing?
[15:13.400 --> 15:20.520]  Basically the timing of that attack or alleged attack was when the Syrian army was advancing
[15:20.520 --> 15:24.960]  very fast and actually the terrorists were collapsing.
[15:24.960 --> 15:27.920]  So why to use it if you have it and if you have the will?
[15:27.920 --> 15:31.880]  Why to use it at that timing, not when you are in a difficult situation?
[15:31.880 --> 15:32.880]  Logically.
[15:32.880 --> 15:33.880]  This is first.
[15:33.880 --> 15:37.760]  Second, if you want to use it, if you have it and if you want to use it again, this is,
[15:37.760 --> 15:42.960]  if we suppose, why to use it against civilians, not to use it again, the terrorists that we
[15:42.960 --> 15:43.960]  are fighting.
[15:43.960 --> 15:53.920]  Third, in that area, we don't have army, we don't have butters, we don't have any, any,
[15:53.920 --> 15:57.600]  any let's say object in Khanshikhon and it's not a strategic area.
[15:57.600 --> 15:58.600]  Why to attack it?
[15:58.600 --> 16:04.040]  Well, what the, what the reason, military, I'm talking about military from, from a military
[16:04.040 --> 16:06.040]  point of view.
[16:06.040 --> 16:11.160]  Of course, the foundation for us morally, we wouldn't do it if we have it, we wouldn't
[16:11.160 --> 16:16.360]  have the will because morally this is not acceptable, we won't have the support of the
[16:16.360 --> 16:17.360]  public.
[16:17.360 --> 16:20.720]  So every indication is against the whole story.
[16:20.720 --> 16:26.440]  So we can say that this play that they stage doesn't work together, the story is not convincing
[16:26.440 --> 16:28.240]  by any means.
[16:28.240 --> 16:34.680]  And then we are not supposed to be able to even show you that, ladies and gentlemen.
[16:34.680 --> 16:38.080]  So here it is.
[16:38.080 --> 16:44.600]  It says bonus example, it goes on to say, what about this news article, which covers
[16:44.600 --> 16:46.280]  the same subject?
[16:46.280 --> 16:52.920]  We'd give it a rating of high to high plus, while CNN isn't a perfect news outlet, it's
[16:52.920 --> 16:57.840]  a popular news source that covers the story with in depth and mostly straightforward reporting.
[16:57.840 --> 17:01.640]  There are clips of an interview with a side and quotes from experts that help promote
[17:01.640 --> 17:04.880]  and provide context that would be helpful to any user.
[17:04.880 --> 17:10.080]  To compare to M4's article, it is brief, only mentions statements from sources, not really
[17:10.080 --> 17:11.080]  typical.
[17:11.080 --> 17:15.040]  Putin, former Congressman Ron Paul and Assad himself, which seem to be making the case
[17:15.040 --> 17:21.960]  here that bolsters the sites previously held perspectives, which cut against the grain.
[17:21.960 --> 17:24.480]  And it just goes on to say, shut us down.
[17:24.480 --> 17:32.560]  And they go on to say that we're being kind only saying that they are medium to poor.
[17:32.560 --> 17:36.080]  Good reputation is sufficient to give a page a low rating.
[17:36.080 --> 17:38.560]  They go on to say CNN has a good reputation.
[17:38.560 --> 17:39.560]  Where's your facts on that?
[17:39.560 --> 17:45.520]  I've got a Pew poll, I've got a Gallup poll from last year, Associated Press.
[17:45.520 --> 17:49.920]  Just 6% of people say they trust media, and that means mainstream media.
[17:49.920 --> 17:52.560]  You can read the study.
[17:52.560 --> 17:59.720]  So they have a 6%, but you're saying they have this incredibly high trusted rating.
[17:59.720 --> 18:04.680]  You scroll down, that's Associated Press right there, posted a bright bar.
[18:04.680 --> 18:10.240]  So Google takes out major contract to deal with M4's from its search index.
[18:10.240 --> 18:16.000]  Now remember, Google announced last month, they said, we are going to test in certain
[18:16.000 --> 18:22.000]  countries having a rating system that when you go through our browser, it tells you whether
[18:22.000 --> 18:27.400]  it's trusted or whether it's not trusted or whether it's bad.
[18:27.400 --> 18:31.280]  And then we're going to use Snopes and other Democratic Party groups to decide what's real
[18:31.280 --> 18:33.680]  and what isn't.
[18:33.680 --> 18:38.360]  Now this is all secretive, but we have the documents up on infowars.com from inside
[18:38.360 --> 18:39.360]  Google.
[18:39.360 --> 18:43.680]  And you should go read them for yourself where they describe how to do this, and now how
[18:43.680 --> 18:47.480]  they're just going to drive you down on the search results where you can't even be seen.
[18:47.480 --> 18:51.440]  And understand, they've done this before, WikiLeaks, Assange, Google directly allied
[18:51.440 --> 18:57.360]  with Clinton campaign, driving down their search results so you couldn't read WikiLeaks.
[18:57.360 --> 19:02.240]  WikiLeaks is now listed as fake news by Google.
[19:02.240 --> 19:05.440]  You couldn't get more real than sourced real documents.
[19:05.440 --> 19:09.280]  No one's ever denied these WikiLeaks documents are real.
[19:09.280 --> 19:13.760]  But remember what Cuomo said on CNN, you're not allowed to read WikiLeaks, only CNN is,
[19:13.760 --> 19:17.160]  so you don't read them or you can get in trouble.
[19:17.160 --> 19:18.160]  And that's what they're saying.
[19:18.160 --> 19:20.160]  You're not allowed to visit infowars.com.
[19:20.160 --> 19:24.720]  You're not allowed to visit prismplanet.com, which Google de-listed years ago.
[19:24.720 --> 19:28.320]  You're not allowed to actually go see our information.
[19:28.320 --> 19:30.680]  You're not actually allowed to decide for yourself.
[19:30.680 --> 19:35.640]  But what's crazy is they say, all these world leaders coming out and agreeing with Alex
[19:35.640 --> 19:38.720]  Jones about a false flag gives them credibility.
[19:38.720 --> 19:41.000]  So they're only posting things that give them credibility.
[19:41.000 --> 19:42.040]  What are you talking about?
[19:42.040 --> 19:46.040]  The rebels have been caught launching staged chemical attacks.
[19:46.040 --> 19:48.520]  That is mainstream news.
[19:48.520 --> 19:54.320]  And now without any investigation, they're coming out and saying that Assad did this
[19:54.320 --> 19:55.320]  again.
[19:55.320 --> 19:58.000]  We're here with common sense standing against this.

[22:02.200 --> 22:06.240]  against the corporate behemoths with all their money and lawyers, but they don't know
[22:06.240 --> 22:07.240]  Harry's.

[24:11.480 --> 24:14.440]  The truth is, ladies and gentlemen, we're the opposite of fake news.
[24:14.440 --> 24:15.440]  We're real.
[24:15.440 --> 24:17.040]  But we are passionate.
[24:17.040 --> 24:22.960]  We wear our bias to tell the truth on our sleeves, and we do it through hard news reporting.
[24:22.960 --> 24:25.320]  We do it through punditry analysis.
[24:25.320 --> 24:30.360]  I've done it through satire and comedy and dressing up like a joker.
[24:30.360 --> 24:34.200]  But at the end of the day, do you really think a sob and launch a chemical attack on its
[24:34.200 --> 24:38.240]  own people when the government said, we're going to come in and take you out, if you
[24:38.240 --> 24:41.800]  do, when the rebels have been caught doing it before?
[24:41.800 --> 24:44.360]  That's your own common sense.
[24:44.360 --> 24:49.680]  And it's because we are promoting common sense, challenging the countervailing lies and fraud
[24:49.680 --> 24:54.960]  we're being forced fed that they don't want any other voices out there challenging them.
[24:54.960 --> 25:02.360]  And they want to have Google, one of the biggest corporations in the world, gang up on infowars.com.
[25:02.360 --> 25:06.480]  We were delisted off Adroll that advertises through Google.
[25:06.480 --> 25:09.600]  We've had the Democrats and David Brock and all of them calling for us to be shut down
[25:09.600 --> 25:11.640]  off Google and banned off YouTube.
[25:11.640 --> 25:13.360]  And I'm sure that's next.
[25:13.360 --> 25:20.360]  This is all part of the strangling us out first and killing our credibility and assassinating
[25:20.360 --> 25:23.280]  our character before they completely shut us off.
[25:23.280 --> 25:26.840]  And understand this, if they can shut us off, freedom dies in the dark.
[25:26.840 --> 25:32.520]  The Washington Post pushing the call to shut down new media, alternative media, are the
[25:32.520 --> 25:36.800]  very purveyors of the darkness they claim they're fighting.
[25:36.800 --> 25:38.440]  We are promoting common sense.
[25:38.440 --> 25:40.720]  We are promoting the sovereignty of this nation.
[25:40.720 --> 25:45.560]  We are promoting what's really in Obamacare, the death panels and the doubling prices and
[25:45.560 --> 25:47.960]  Gruber saying, thank God you're so dumb.
[25:47.960 --> 25:50.280]  They don't want us showing you, Gruber.
[25:50.280 --> 25:55.640]  They don't want us showing you where they sit here in their own internal documents and
[25:55.640 --> 25:59.480]  say that we've got to be shut down, we've got to be destroyed.
[25:59.480 --> 26:06.000]  And then saying that we're crazy, that showing Iran Paul Clip is incredible.
[26:06.000 --> 26:10.680]  You know how scared they are knowing that Paul Watson's there and Matt Drudge is there
[26:10.680 --> 26:14.840]  and Mike Cernovich is there and countless others that are willing to actually talk to
[26:14.840 --> 26:18.600]  people in government that are patriots and put out the information.
[26:18.600 --> 26:22.400]  Remember eight years ago when we got the Homeland Security report saying they were training
[26:22.400 --> 26:26.200]  to take on veterans and gun owners and saying we were the number one terror threat?
[26:26.200 --> 26:30.400]  People didn't believe that document for a week, even though I got it from Federal Marshal.
[26:30.400 --> 26:35.520]  Then I got sent in more copies by state police, the local versions, and the media had to admit,
[26:35.520 --> 26:36.920]  yes, that's a real document.
[26:36.920 --> 26:42.600]  And we stand by, we stand by the claim that veterans are the number one terror threat
[26:42.600 --> 26:44.400]  in America.
[26:44.400 --> 26:48.680]  Info wars has broken thousands of national stories that you would have never heard that
[26:48.680 --> 26:50.640]  would have never been out there.
[26:50.640 --> 26:55.320]  Thanks to whistleblowers and patriots like the Google contractor who sent us this information
[26:55.320 --> 26:56.560]  so that we know about it.
[26:56.560 --> 27:00.760]  I am very upset about this, not for info wars.
[27:00.760 --> 27:03.760]  I'm very proud of the fact that we've been so prominent in the fight against the globalists
[27:03.760 --> 27:08.160]  that we now are the tip of the spear in this, but we're a bellwether.
[27:08.160 --> 27:12.960]  And if we don't stand strong, and if you don't stand strong with us, we don't have any future.
[27:12.960 --> 27:18.960]  They are putting out lies about us that are so twisted now on every front, it is truly
[27:18.960 --> 27:19.960]  unbelievable.
[27:19.960 --> 27:24.960]  They've got headlines everywhere, out there saying things that I never said or I never
[27:24.960 --> 27:27.920]  did because the enemy is scared.
[27:27.920 --> 27:32.520]  They know there's a revolution inside corporations, inside government, everywhere else against
[27:32.520 --> 27:36.720]  their tyranny, and they don't know what to do, and they openly admit they want a technocracy
[27:36.720 --> 27:43.360]  to bring in total AI control and censorship, where AI computers are watching and censoring
[27:43.360 --> 27:47.440]  and surveilling in live time, so the people don't even have to make the decisions, so
[27:47.440 --> 27:51.600]  the big algorithms make the decisions on how you're penalized or how you're fired with
[27:51.600 --> 27:57.600]  this Web ID rating system, where if you're not a good globalist, you get delisted with
[27:57.600 --> 28:02.320]  your cultural avatar, and you're like, my God, absolutely.
[28:02.320 --> 28:06.680]  What they're doing to us is a beta test for you.
[28:06.680 --> 28:11.400]  That's why it's more essential than it's ever been for people to realize this is a fight
[28:11.400 --> 28:15.840]  between humans and our free speech and our will and the social engineers.
[28:15.840 --> 28:20.240]  And that's why it's more important than ever that you spread the links to info wars.com
[28:20.240 --> 28:23.360]  and that you point out that this is happening and that you call talk radio and that you
[28:23.360 --> 28:28.120]  call Congress, because the system thinks you're just going to roll over.
[28:28.120 --> 28:30.320]  The system thinks that you can be broken.
[28:30.320 --> 28:32.000]  They think that you can be dominated.
[28:32.000 --> 28:33.640]  They think that they've already won.
[28:33.640 --> 28:36.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, we've always strove to tell the truth.
[28:36.920 --> 28:41.080]  We've changed the world because of your action and what you've done.
[28:41.080 --> 28:45.500]  And now we are the brunt of the main assault, so I need all the other bloggers and all the
[28:45.500 --> 28:49.720]  other newspapers and publications that we've defended when they've been censored, standing
[28:49.720 --> 28:54.080]  up for info wars.com, because the censorship that Matt Drudge warned about a year and a
[28:54.080 --> 29:00.560]  half ago in my studio is now here because we have told the truth, because we are effective
[29:00.560 --> 29:02.840]  and because they don't want you to have a voice.
[29:02.840 --> 29:07.080]  They want to be able to quietly shut everybody down.
[29:07.080 --> 29:10.600]  So again, what are you doing today to stand up and fight this?
[29:10.600 --> 29:11.680]  We're so close to winning.
[29:11.680 --> 29:14.000]  That's why they've really gambled pushing this.
[29:14.000 --> 29:16.480]  This is going to blow up in their face.
[29:16.480 --> 29:17.800]  They believe their AI can do it.
[29:17.800 --> 29:18.880]  They believe their censorship can do it.
[29:18.880 --> 29:23.040]  They believe going out and hiring armies of real people to go and manipulate their algorithm
[29:23.040 --> 29:24.540]  will turn this around.
[29:24.540 --> 29:28.280]  It won't if you stand up and if you take action.
[29:28.280 --> 29:31.360]  We're fighting hard, ladies and gentlemen, and we need your support and your prayers
[29:31.360 --> 29:32.360]  now more than ever.
[29:32.360 --> 29:36.520]  We'll be right back with Paul Joseph Watson, Mike Cernovich and others with the huge breaking
[29:36.520 --> 29:48.360]  scoop of Google's plan to end free speech in America.
[29:48.360 --> 29:52.080]  Here on the march, the empire's on the run.
[29:52.080 --> 29:59.520]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[29:59.520 --> 30:00.920]  You have no money?
[30:00.920 --> 30:01.920]  This is okay.
[30:01.920 --> 30:03.080]  We will take your blood.
[30:03.080 --> 30:08.840]  If you want access to the Vatican museums, cash, visa, mastercard or needle is accepted.
[30:08.840 --> 30:09.840]  That's right.
[30:09.840 --> 30:12.320]  You can give blood to access the Vatican Museum.
[30:12.320 --> 30:17.280]  The blood payment plan has a slogan, give blood and follow your artistic inclination.
[30:17.280 --> 30:20.760]  Blood donors then receive a voucher which gives them access to the museums.
[30:20.760 --> 30:25.080]  The director of the Vatican Museum said, without blood, there is no life.
[30:25.080 --> 30:27.920]  Without art, life would be empty and sad.
[30:27.920 --> 30:29.960]  Okay, I love Jesus too.
[30:29.960 --> 30:31.080]  Happy Easter.
[30:31.080 --> 30:32.920]  I guess this is a good idea.
[30:32.920 --> 30:35.960]  Get some blood donations and allow people access to history.
[30:35.960 --> 30:36.960]  Sounds harmless.
[30:36.960 --> 30:40.480]  But wait, each blood donation is good for a four-year-old voucher.
[30:40.480 --> 30:43.600]  It costs 16 euros to access the museums.
[30:43.600 --> 30:47.320]  So you have to donate blood four times before you can even get in.
[30:47.320 --> 30:50.680]  By the time you've given enough blood, you'd have fainted.
[30:50.680 --> 30:54.680]  Enjoy Michelangelo's Last Judgment as you recover from hypovolemia.
[30:54.680 --> 30:57.880]  For Infowars.com, this is Owen Schreuer.

[31:59.000 --> 32:02.480]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back
[32:02.480 --> 32:04.760]  in stock at InfowarsStore.com.
[32:04.760 --> 32:06.560]  Research across the board is clear.
[32:06.560 --> 32:10.480]  When bacteria infect your gums, it can enter your bloodstream, and even contribute to blood
[32:10.480 --> 32:11.880]  clots and heart attacks.
[32:11.880 --> 32:16.520]  That's why the Last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that your oral health
[32:16.520 --> 32:19.280]  can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[32:19.280 --> 32:22.040]  Super Blue fluoride-free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[32:22.040 --> 32:26.360]  It's loaded with good halogen iodine, so the bad halogen fluoride.
[32:26.360 --> 32:30.920]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since Biblical times to help wipe out
[32:30.920 --> 32:33.440]  bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[32:33.440 --> 32:38.080]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue, chosen by our dental experts include xylitol,
[32:38.080 --> 32:42.960]  peppermint oil, iodine, nano-silver and more, due to requests from listeners who found that
[32:42.960 --> 32:45.440]  spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their children.
[32:45.440 --> 32:49.440]  We have created the new Bubble Gum flavored Super Blue that is spearmint-free.
[32:49.440 --> 32:54.520]  Learn more about the new Bubble Gum flavored Super Blue toothpaste and more at InfowarsLife.com

[32:59.520 --> 33:16.800]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[33:16.800 --> 33:17.800]  We are back live.
[33:17.800 --> 33:21.960]  I'm about to hand the baton to Paul Watson, Mike Cernovich and others in the main studio.
[33:21.960 --> 33:24.080]  I have a closing statement for you today.
[33:24.080 --> 33:29.200]  Again, Alex Jones here on this Monday edition.
[33:29.200 --> 33:33.880]  The first thing they did when Trump got elected was saying mainstream news, corporate news,
[33:33.880 --> 33:34.880]  get rid of his Twitter.
[33:34.880 --> 33:35.880]  Don't let him have it.
[33:35.880 --> 33:38.400]  And Twitter said, we'll consider taking it away from him.
[33:38.400 --> 33:42.640]  The president's Twitter, think about the arrogance of these people working with the
[33:42.640 --> 33:46.400]  Communist Chinese and others to war game, bringing the censorship here.
[33:46.400 --> 33:48.440]  And we told you it was coming.
[33:48.440 --> 33:53.800]  So now I'm blown away by the fact that they would use, in their directive inside Google,
[33:53.800 --> 33:59.520]  to all contractors, the example of us being fake news and saying ban us.
[33:59.520 --> 34:03.040]  Well, they're the ones that have been caught manipulating the election, trying to defraud
[34:03.040 --> 34:04.040]  the American voters.
[34:04.040 --> 34:06.240]  They talk about outside Russian involvement.
[34:06.240 --> 34:11.160]  We had corporate global espionage by Google, Facebook, Twitter and others, openly working
[34:11.160 --> 34:12.320]  for Hillary Clinton.
[34:12.320 --> 34:13.520]  But still they failed.
[34:13.520 --> 34:14.720]  And that's why they're pissed.
[34:14.720 --> 34:19.280]  And it's not my opinion, it's clearly criminal what Google and others have done.
[34:19.280 --> 34:22.320]  And Trump needs to break them up for antitrust violations.
[34:22.320 --> 34:26.200]  And Google wants a war, there's going to be demonstrations out front of your facility.
[34:26.200 --> 34:28.480]  As God as my witness, I'm coming soon.
[34:28.480 --> 34:32.440]  And we are going to the next level, lawsuits you name it, we've got to do it.
[34:32.440 --> 34:34.720]  But everybody's got to contact Trump by letters.
[34:34.720 --> 34:36.640]  They've been trying to keep those from him.
[34:36.640 --> 34:38.400]  Everybody's got to go to events.
[34:38.400 --> 34:41.480]  Everybody's got to tweet at him and try to get him to go deep into the Twitter because
[34:41.480 --> 34:44.320]  they only let the negative stuff go to the top.
[34:44.320 --> 34:45.720]  We've got to go demonstrate everywhere.
[34:45.720 --> 34:48.160]  Next time I talk to the president, front and center.
[34:48.160 --> 34:51.960]  The times I talk to him, I don't bring up how we're getting censorship or attack because
[34:51.960 --> 34:54.960]  I tend to be humble and don't talk about myself.
[34:54.960 --> 35:00.960]  But next time I talk to the president, next time Roger talks to him, which is very routine.
[35:00.960 --> 35:02.440]  I am going full tilt.
[35:02.440 --> 35:04.280]  You want a war, you got one.
[35:04.280 --> 35:07.960]  They are just every week cutting us off, cutting us off, cutting us off, cutting us off.
[35:07.960 --> 35:16.480]  And using as the example that we used Ron Paul as a source on his own TV show out of Houston,
[35:16.480 --> 35:22.080]  indicated across the country, totally respected by the left and the right, saying he's not
[35:22.080 --> 35:25.120]  credible because it backed up our earlier claims.
[35:25.120 --> 35:28.880]  What videos of the rebels firing chemical attacks before?
[35:28.880 --> 35:34.920]  Ron Paul listing with his host the UN report saying it was the rebels.
[35:34.920 --> 35:37.480]  I mean, that's in mainstream news.
[35:37.480 --> 35:42.720]  We've got all the headlines right here saying Syrian chemical attack fabricated Assad.
[35:42.720 --> 35:43.720]  That's the clip we played.
[35:43.720 --> 35:44.720]  We played it earlier.
[35:44.720 --> 35:47.960]  Putin saying they're planning more.
[35:47.960 --> 35:55.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, that's what's so incredible about this is they say we're not allowed
[35:55.720 --> 35:59.600]  to show you what Assad said, but everybody else says.
[35:59.600 --> 36:03.640]  Because again, it backs up what we previously said because we've been proven right is why
[36:03.640 --> 36:04.640]  you're not allowed to see us.
[36:04.640 --> 36:08.440]  So in closing, there's big world news Paul's going to cover it all.
[36:08.440 --> 36:11.400]  But understand we're not just some side group getting censored.
[36:11.400 --> 36:13.720]  This is the main tip of the spear.
[36:13.720 --> 36:18.440]  This is a big deal that we have the internal Google documents and Google sits there and
[36:18.440 --> 36:23.720]  watches their employees and watches their contractors and how they vote, surveilling
[36:23.720 --> 36:30.680]  them beyond the NSA and ordering them on how to go downvote things and then talking about
[36:30.680 --> 36:34.440]  how credible they are and how good they are and how they're protecting the public and
[36:34.440 --> 36:40.320]  how they've got quotes in here about in the general elliptical, even if something is based
[36:40.320 --> 36:41.320]  in facts.
[36:41.320 --> 36:42.320]  Let me show that to you.
[36:42.320 --> 36:48.440]  But in the general elliptical, even if something is based in facts, you need to go ahead and
[36:48.440 --> 36:50.160]  ban it.
[36:50.160 --> 36:55.560]  I mean, this is the craziest stuff I've ever seen in my life.
[36:55.560 --> 37:03.240]  Imagine, even if it's accurate, in the general elliptical, why don't you come to China and
[37:03.240 --> 37:07.360]  call it elliptical when they execute Buddhists for no reason or have mobile execution vans
[37:07.360 --> 37:10.840]  or kill Christians in gulags?
[37:10.840 --> 37:15.600]  Well, in the general elliptical of China, it's okay for the greater good.
[37:15.600 --> 37:17.040]  That's what it means.
[37:17.040 --> 37:25.800]  They say in the general elliptical, even if what we're saying is true, in the larger,
[37:25.800 --> 37:33.320]  more elliptical sense of the term, I mean, these people are unbelievable, ladies and
[37:33.320 --> 37:34.480]  gentlemen.
[37:34.480 --> 37:36.040]  They lied and said Hillary's going to win.
[37:36.040 --> 37:37.320]  They put out fake polls.
[37:37.320 --> 37:39.560]  Google admittedly gamed the search engines.
[37:39.560 --> 37:43.080]  All right, Paul Joseph Watson is taking over.
[37:43.080 --> 37:47.200]  I just want to say in closing, if you do not spread our links, if you do not support us,
[37:47.200 --> 37:51.440]  if you do not contact Congress, if we do not make a big deal out of this, then we're going
[37:51.440 --> 37:53.840]  to be strangled and you're going to be strangled politically.
[37:53.840 --> 37:57.480]  They're sick of info wars, being able to break big stories and have Congress cover it.
[37:57.480 --> 38:01.840]  They've admitted on MSNBC and CNN, they're pissed that you were able to set the agenda
[38:01.840 --> 38:03.040]  through this focal point.
[38:03.040 --> 38:06.720]  They're pissed that Drudge is able to actually break through and actually have some other
[38:06.720 --> 38:10.280]  talking points that aren't George Soros's in the media.
[38:10.280 --> 38:11.280]  So you want us to fight?
[38:11.280 --> 38:12.280]  We're doing it.
[38:12.280 --> 38:16.440]  In closing, we're extending Easter specials through tomorrow.
[38:16.440 --> 38:21.480]  We have massive specials, 30% off super high quality, new tropics like Rainforest, Super
[38:21.480 --> 38:27.640]  Mill Vitality, Vitamin Mineral Fusion, Vitamin B12 Secret 12, Survival Shield X2, High Quality
[38:27.640 --> 38:36.600]  Nacin iodine that is running out, infowarstore.com, infowarslife.com, or AAA-253-3139.
[38:36.600 --> 38:41.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, the New World Order is coming after us because we are game changers
[38:41.680 --> 38:43.040]  and are having a big effect.
[38:43.040 --> 38:44.360]  I know you know that.
[38:44.360 --> 38:48.960]  But follow us on Twitter at Real Alex Jones, retweet everything we do, take everything
[38:48.960 --> 38:51.920]  we have on Facebook and send out to everyone you know.
[38:51.920 --> 38:54.000]  Copy our videos to your YouTube channels.
[38:54.000 --> 38:55.000]  Start your own.
[38:55.000 --> 38:56.320]  Start a local radio show.
[38:56.320 --> 38:57.320]  Promote free speech.
[38:57.320 --> 38:58.440]  Just get active.
[38:58.440 --> 38:59.440]  Get involved.
[38:59.440 --> 39:02.960]  Soros and his big mobs are out everywhere trying to bully people.
[39:02.960 --> 39:04.040]  Be like Mike Cernovich.
[39:04.040 --> 39:05.040]  Go down.
[39:05.040 --> 39:09.520]  You know, open Mike and scream Bill Clinton's a rapist because he did settle rape cases
[39:09.520 --> 39:12.800]  and these people are frauds and it's time to stand up against him.
[39:12.800 --> 39:17.200]  I want to thank Mike Cernovich and his sources for getting us this key intel.
[39:17.200 --> 39:18.440]  This is a big, big story.
[39:18.440 --> 39:19.600]  It affects everybody.
[39:19.600 --> 39:24.280]  It's up on infowars.com and I'm asking everybody to hang together, hang separate, as Benjamin
[39:24.280 --> 39:25.280]  Franklin said.
[39:25.280 --> 39:28.440]  If you don't financially support us and get great products you need, if you don't spread
[39:28.440 --> 39:32.920]  the links, if you don't share the link infowars.com forward slash show, they win.
[39:32.920 --> 39:35.640]  They're already pushing us down in the search ranks.
[39:35.640 --> 39:38.560]  They're already putting all the garbage and lies up there on top.
[39:38.560 --> 39:43.640]  They're already going into high gear because we are having an ultra massive effect.
[39:43.640 --> 39:48.200]  Infowars.com, infowarslife.com or AAA-253-3139.
[39:48.200 --> 39:52.920]  If you've never bought products from us before, now is the time to get a gravity-fed filter
[39:52.920 --> 39:55.320]  the highest rated, 40% off.
[39:55.320 --> 39:59.560]  Now is the time to get a Trump is my president shirt just for free speech exercise.
[39:59.560 --> 40:01.680]  Now is the time to buy some heirloom seeds.
[40:01.680 --> 40:03.280]  Now is the time.
[40:03.280 --> 40:07.360]  Only 1% of you end up actually financially supporting us and I'm not complaining.
[40:07.360 --> 40:08.360]  It's great.
[40:08.360 --> 40:09.520]  We've built a major system to fight them.
[40:09.520 --> 40:10.760]  That's why they're coming at us.
[40:10.760 --> 40:15.480]  But imagine if we're beating them with one finger, if you actually stand up and start
[40:15.480 --> 40:20.240]  supporting us and aggressively spreading the links, nothing will stop you.
[40:20.240 --> 40:22.000]  So again, I want to thank you all for what you're doing.
[40:22.000 --> 40:23.000]  This is so historic.
[40:23.000 --> 40:27.360]  I'm so honored to be here with this amazing crew and in closing, please pray for us because
[40:27.360 --> 40:31.520]  that God is in charge and this is an epic historical battle happening right now.
[40:31.520 --> 40:35.360]  Okay, Paul's going to be here for the next two and a half, three hours, go to the fourth
[40:35.360 --> 40:36.360]  hour of the other hosts.
[40:36.360 --> 40:39.760]  It's coming up big, big shows and I got a lot of other big issues.
[40:39.760 --> 40:41.520]  I'm fighting on the same front.
[40:41.520 --> 40:45.280]  The enemy has hit me from every side and it's because we're so effective.
[40:45.280 --> 40:50.400]  So again, thank you all for your prayers now to Paul Watson in the other studio.
[40:50.400 --> 40:51.400]  And we are live.
[40:51.400 --> 40:54.040]  It's April 17th, 2017.
[40:54.040 --> 40:57.640]  I am Paul Joseph Watson live in studio in Austin.
[40:57.640 --> 41:01.480]  We have an absolutely massive jam patch show to come.
[41:01.480 --> 41:05.160]  The New York Times has come out and we're going to get into this later and said that
[41:05.160 --> 41:07.960]  Trump now needs to support ISIS.
[41:07.960 --> 41:13.240]  He actively needs to encourage ISIS, of course, two weeks after they bombed Assad, after they
[41:13.240 --> 41:15.240]  bombed the airfield.
[41:15.240 --> 41:17.840]  Absolutely insane editorial out of the New York Times.
[41:17.840 --> 41:18.840]  So we're going to cover that.
[41:18.840 --> 41:21.160]  We're going to cover the battle of Berkeley.
[41:21.160 --> 41:26.040]  Of course, you had the first battle of Berkeley where women were pepper sprayed in the face
[41:26.040 --> 41:28.640]  where people were beaten with flagpoles.
[41:28.640 --> 41:30.240]  You all saw that.
[41:30.240 --> 41:33.960]  Most of you probably saw what happened this past weekend, but we're going to delve into
[41:33.960 --> 41:35.160]  that even more.
[41:35.160 --> 41:41.600]  The French election is coming up on April 23rd, just six days away from the first round
[41:41.600 --> 41:43.600]  of the French election.
[41:43.600 --> 41:46.520]  Marine Le Pen is being completely sabotaged.
[41:46.520 --> 41:53.040]  Of course, she is the anti-globalist candidate as this populist wave revolution sweeps the
[41:53.040 --> 41:54.040]  West.
[41:54.040 --> 42:00.960]  And now handing out ballots to 500,000 people who live outside of France, they're handing
[42:00.960 --> 42:03.480]  out two ballots.
[42:03.480 --> 42:07.600]  Most people who live outside of France aren't going to support Marine Le Pen, but they're
[42:07.600 --> 42:11.280]  going to get two ballots and the police have said, oh, we don't really care.
[42:11.280 --> 42:13.680]  We'll investigate it after the election.
[42:13.680 --> 42:18.480]  That could turn the entire election in France and nobody really cares about it.
[42:18.480 --> 42:22.960]  So we're going to get into that two huge guests coming up in the next hour.
[42:22.960 --> 42:27.720]  We have Lionel, the scholarly tape that he always has on current affairs.
[42:27.720 --> 42:28.720]  So we look forward to that.
[42:28.720 --> 42:31.800]  Of course, he is a radio host at Lionelmedia.com.
[42:31.800 --> 42:37.440]  And we have Mike Cernovich to break down, as Alex just explained, the most egregious
[42:37.440 --> 42:41.440]  form of censorship that we have faced to date.
[42:41.440 --> 42:46.840]  This is not just about Facebook blocking our links, saying that we're spam shadow banning
[42:46.840 --> 42:48.120]  on Twitter.
[42:48.120 --> 42:53.400]  This is even worse because this is Google and Google is basically the internet at this
[42:53.400 --> 42:54.400]  point.
[42:54.400 --> 42:57.600]  So we're going to get into the arguments about, oh, it's a private company that can do what
[42:57.600 --> 42:58.600]  they want.
[42:58.600 --> 42:59.600]  No, they can't.
[42:59.600 --> 43:00.600]  They're a monopoly.
[43:00.600 --> 43:02.440]  They basically are the internet at this point.
[43:02.440 --> 43:08.320]  Now they're openly relegating in four Wars links to delist them to prevent them from
[43:08.320 --> 43:10.360]  appearing appearing near the top of the page.
[43:10.360 --> 43:13.240]  Of course, we saw this coming a few weeks ago.
[43:13.240 --> 43:18.040]  We had a story about Google delisting criticism of Islam.
[43:18.040 --> 43:24.920]  So you had websites that merely pointed to quotations, direct quotations out of the Koran
[43:24.920 --> 43:28.360]  about Islam not being a religion of peace.
[43:28.360 --> 43:30.560]  That was deemed hateful.
[43:30.560 --> 43:32.360]  That was delisted.
[43:32.360 --> 43:40.600]  That was buried on page four of Google search results when you type in Islam violence Koran.
[43:40.600 --> 43:46.000]  There you see the article from March 17th, Google to target criticism of Islam in new
[43:46.000 --> 43:50.000]  censorship purge and the example they gave was a website.
[43:50.000 --> 43:55.640]  I think it was put up by a former congresswoman or somebody who was politically active, somebody
[43:55.640 --> 44:02.240]  who was a public figure, an analyst, simply going through passages in the Koran saying,
[44:02.240 --> 44:03.240]  kill all the infidels.
[44:03.240 --> 44:04.240]  This is violent.
[44:04.240 --> 44:06.120]  No, you can't say that on your own website.
[44:06.120 --> 44:08.200]  You will be delisted on Google.
[44:08.200 --> 44:14.360]  Now they're doing it to info wars whole sale and Mike Cernovich has got the inside source
[44:14.360 --> 44:15.360]  on that.
[44:15.360 --> 44:18.680]  He came to us with that monumental story last night.
[44:18.680 --> 44:20.360]  He's going to break it down further.
[44:20.360 --> 44:25.840]  We're going to get into the true agenda behind that, how we can fight back against it.
[44:25.840 --> 44:31.160]  But I want to talk about the situation in Cleveland first because you probably have
[44:31.160 --> 44:36.440]  seen the video by now, most of you on Facebook or on Twitter, absolutely harrowing.
[44:36.440 --> 44:38.840]  If you haven't seen the video, don't.
[44:38.840 --> 44:40.400]  It's not worth watching it.
[44:40.400 --> 44:45.920]  It will kill you to the core and we have an article out of Axios murder in Cleveland Facebook's
[44:45.920 --> 44:51.560]  latest fiasco and this guy is still at large Cleveland police said on Sunday that manhunt
[44:51.560 --> 44:56.360]  was underway after a man uploaded a video of himself killing someone to Facebook, then
[44:56.360 --> 45:01.040]  going on Facebook live and claiming to have committed multiple other homicides which are
[45:01.040 --> 45:02.800]  yet to be verified.
[45:02.800 --> 45:09.120]  Thankfully, the only fatality that we know about so far is this one poor old guy who
[45:09.120 --> 45:14.200]  was collecting tin cans, who's obviously down on his luck.
[45:14.200 --> 45:22.080]  Old guy, this lunatic walks up to him, says, mentioned the name of what I presume to be
[45:22.080 --> 45:26.560]  his former lover or whatever, just shoots him in the face.
[45:26.560 --> 45:29.080]  Absolutely senseless, chilling.
[45:29.080 --> 45:31.320]  People talk about the mundaneness of evil.
[45:31.320 --> 45:36.920]  You can watch ISIS beheading videos when they break in the news and at least there's some
[45:36.920 --> 45:43.760]  kind of narrative that you can pin on it, no matter how twisted, whereas this, absolutely
[45:43.760 --> 45:50.240]  totally senseless, just walks up on a poor black guy collecting tin cans to sell for
[45:50.240 --> 45:54.800]  recycling, shoots him in the head, uploads it to Facebook.
[45:54.800 --> 45:59.040]  Now what they're claiming is that this is Facebook's fault and we basically need to
[45:59.040 --> 46:00.360]  ban Facebook live.
[46:00.360 --> 46:06.640]  The article continues, Facebook was unable to pull the live broadcast down in real time
[46:06.640 --> 46:10.840]  and failed to remove the killing video for several hours after the fact.
[46:10.840 --> 46:12.760]  So now we have to ban Facebook live.
[46:12.760 --> 46:16.600]  The suspect, Steve Stevens, is still at large.
[46:16.600 --> 46:20.200]  They're saying now he's probably left the Cleveland area.
[46:20.200 --> 46:24.640]  The quote from the article, Facebook live worst case has happened.
[46:24.640 --> 46:29.920]  Facebook has to decide if it wants to continue with it, knowing risk to reputation and public
[46:29.920 --> 46:30.920]  safety.
[46:30.920 --> 46:33.560]  So now they're saying, let's not explore why this is happening.
[46:33.560 --> 46:39.400]  Let's just ban Facebook live, even though the video wasn't even uploaded or live streamed
[46:39.400 --> 46:40.400]  on Facebook live.
[46:40.400 --> 46:42.520]  It was uploaded after the fact.
[46:42.520 --> 46:46.240]  But CNN covered this story yesterday, hours after it broke.
[46:46.240 --> 46:48.400]  And this is an article out of the Ralph report.
[46:48.400 --> 46:54.000]  CNN refuses to call Cleveland shooter Steve Stevens black as he continues shooting up
[46:54.000 --> 46:55.000]  Cleveland.
[46:55.000 --> 47:00.880]  Now, to be clear, this has not got a racial dimension so far that we know of.
[47:00.880 --> 47:07.880]  The suspect is black, his victim that we saw callously gunned down on camera is also black.
[47:07.880 --> 47:10.080]  So it has nothing to do with race.
[47:10.080 --> 47:11.680]  It's not a black lives matter thing.
[47:11.680 --> 47:14.800]  It doesn't look like there's any relation to Islam.
[47:14.800 --> 47:18.880]  So people on the right, conservatives didn't make it about race because there's no evidence
[47:18.880 --> 47:21.260]  for it being about race.
[47:21.260 --> 47:25.400]  People on the left made it all about race almost immediately.
[47:25.400 --> 47:31.400]  CNN put up a black silhouette and I think it's in this article if you can find it.
[47:31.400 --> 47:34.440]  We knew the identity of this guy, we knew what he looked like.
[47:34.440 --> 47:39.560]  He streamed his face, he uploaded a video of his face onto Facebook.
[47:39.560 --> 47:44.800]  His identity was known, his name was known and yet CNN put that up.
[47:44.800 --> 47:49.840]  They didn't say he was black, they didn't even put a picture of him up.
[47:49.840 --> 47:50.840]  Why is that?
[47:50.840 --> 47:55.480]  This guy's roaming around Cleveland and God knows where else now, claiming that he's
[47:55.480 --> 48:00.480]  killed people, threatening to kill more people for no reason whatsoever.
[48:00.480 --> 48:02.160]  We know what he looks like.
[48:02.160 --> 48:08.960]  People are deserting the streets and yet CNN then even show his face.
[48:08.960 --> 48:14.640]  Would they show his face if he was white, probably, probably.
[48:14.640 --> 48:18.120]  They always get very excited when there's a mass shooting and it's linked to white
[48:18.120 --> 48:25.200]  supremacism but if there's any question whatsoever, and there isn't at this point but any question
[48:25.200 --> 48:30.720]  whatsoever that this could be black lives matter related, they shut the narrative down
[48:30.720 --> 48:36.360]  to the point where they don't even display the guy who callously gunned down this poor
[48:36.360 --> 48:43.760]  old man, again, refusing to call him black, preventing him from being caught.
[48:43.760 --> 48:48.760]  If somebody had seen this, then they had seen the killer in person, they wouldn't know what
[48:48.760 --> 48:50.200]  he looked like.
[48:50.200 --> 48:55.720]  Meanwhile, D-Ray, D-Ray McKesson, one of the icons, one of the leaders of Black Lives
[48:55.720 --> 48:59.880]  Matter, was tweeting about Gelato.
[48:59.880 --> 49:04.840]  He wasn't interested in this because of course, black lives don't matter when it's black
[49:04.840 --> 49:09.840]  on black violence, they don't want to make that part of the conversation despite the
[49:09.840 --> 49:16.480]  fact that 90% of black murders are committed by other black men, and that has to be part
[49:16.480 --> 49:19.760]  of the conversation if black lives matter.
[49:19.760 --> 49:26.600]  But instead, Tariq Nasheed, another Black Lives Matter supporter on Twitter, an anti-racism
[49:26.600 --> 49:33.400]  strategist whose every other tweet is basically race obsessed, said, quote, and this was a
[49:33.400 --> 49:39.480]  tweet yesterday, some of these white supremacists in Cleveland might use that Facebook killer
[49:39.480 --> 49:44.120]  as an excuse to shoot random black people, so be careful out there.
[49:44.120 --> 49:51.360]  So his primary concern was not finding the culprit, who had just shot dead another black
[49:51.360 --> 49:53.360]  man and uploaded it to Facebook.
[49:53.360 --> 49:58.320]  His primary concern was not that, despite him having a large audience on Twitter, no,
[49:58.320 --> 50:04.840]  his primary concern was to talk about white supremacism.
[50:04.840 --> 50:10.600]  Absolutely no racial dimension whatsoever, yet that was his main concern.
[50:10.600 --> 50:15.240]  Absolutely insane, and they're all over Twitter with this kind of attitude.
[50:15.240 --> 50:22.040]  Breitbart reports on a related subject, gun-controlled Chicago, 29 people shot in under 18 hours.
[50:22.040 --> 50:29.200]  Again, this is not going to be part of the conversation, 90% of black murders are black
[50:29.200 --> 50:30.560]  on black crime.
[50:30.560 --> 50:37.960]  We have 29 people shot in just the last 18 hours alone in Chicago, and it's not part
[50:37.960 --> 50:39.600]  of the conversation.
[50:39.600 --> 50:44.280]  CNN is refusing to even show an image of this guy.
[50:44.280 --> 50:48.560]  We'll be back live on the Alex Jones show with more huge breaking news.
[50:48.560 --> 50:49.560]  Don't go away.
[50:49.560 --> 51:04.800]  If you're in trouble with the IRS and owe at least 10,000 in back taxes, listen to this
[51:04.800 --> 51:06.600]  important public announcement.
[51:06.600 --> 51:11.040]  The IRS is now offering a special program called the Fresh Start Initiative, which can
[51:11.040 --> 51:15.560]  offer significantly reduced settlements that can reduce your liability by thousands of
[51:15.560 --> 51:16.560]  dollars.
[51:16.560 --> 51:20.320]  The unique programs have been allocated to help the economy and substantially reduce
[51:20.320 --> 51:22.400]  or eliminate your tax burden.
[51:22.400 --> 51:26.960]  If you're approved and qualify, the IRS will stop the collections against you.
[51:26.960 --> 51:28.320]  Don't feel overwhelmed.

[54:12.760 --> 54:17.640]  The interest is up and the stock market's down and you're only getting mugged if you
[54:17.640 --> 54:19.080]  go downtown.
[54:19.080 --> 54:27.800]  We have breaking news up on the Drudge Report, it's the top headline right now, this is interesting
[54:27.800 --> 54:34.160]  because I got on a plane on Saturday morning, Saturday afternoon with China warning that
[54:34.160 --> 54:38.960]  war with North Korea between North Korea and the US could be imminent, got on a plane
[54:38.960 --> 54:43.880]  with no internet connection, landed thinking that that could have started.
[54:43.880 --> 54:48.080]  Thankfully it didn't, of course we had the failed missile test, lot of speculation over
[54:48.080 --> 54:51.360]  cyber hacking as to the cause of that.
[54:51.360 --> 54:55.520]  Now the BBC is reporting, this is up on DrudgeReport.com.
[54:55.520 --> 55:00.200]  North Korea will test missiles weekly, senior official tells BBC.
[55:00.200 --> 55:04.680]  The article goes on to say North Korea will continue to test missiles despite international
[55:04.680 --> 55:07.800]  condemnation and increasing military tensions with the US.
[55:07.800 --> 55:12.840]  A senior official has told BBC in Pyongyang, will be conducting more missile tests on a
[55:12.840 --> 55:19.000]  weekly, monthly and yearly basis, Vice Foreign Minister Hang Song Ryle told the BBC's John
[55:19.000 --> 55:20.000]  Sudworth.
[55:20.000 --> 55:24.920]  He said that, quote, an all out war would result if the US took military action.
[55:24.920 --> 55:28.240]  So again, is it bellicose rhetoric?
[55:28.240 --> 55:33.200]  We know that Trump, we know that the United States basically indicated there will be some
[55:33.200 --> 55:40.440]  form of military attack, experts even suggesting an attack on the Yongbong nuclear plant there
[55:40.440 --> 55:47.400]  in North Korea, if they test another missile, certainly if there's a six nuclear test, then
[55:47.400 --> 55:51.520]  that will provoke a massive backlash, a massive response.
[55:51.520 --> 55:56.320]  So these tensions continue to escalate over North Korea and again, most people don't seem
[55:56.320 --> 56:03.040]  to be factoring in the fact that if they're attacked, they will immediately launch artillery
[56:03.040 --> 56:07.760]  battery weapons into South Korea that could escalate extremely quickly.
[56:07.760 --> 56:12.360]  You're talking about at least a million people dead.
[56:12.360 --> 56:17.400]  And those estimates were from 10, 15 years ago, so it's probably even more now.
[56:17.400 --> 56:23.680]  We had Japan evacuating or at least planning to evacuate their citizens from South Korea.
[56:23.680 --> 56:29.120]  We had reports that people in Pyongyang, North Koreans were being evacuated.
[56:29.120 --> 56:30.200]  This is not over.
[56:30.200 --> 56:34.320]  This is only going to build again, North Korea has repeatedly tested these these missiles.
[56:34.320 --> 56:38.040]  There's nothing to suggest they're not going to keep doing that.
[56:38.040 --> 56:43.760]  But of course, the effect it's had domestically in the US is this out of Rasmussen, also upon
[56:43.760 --> 56:47.960]  the Georgia report, Trump's approval rating hits 50%.
[56:47.960 --> 56:54.440]  Bearing in mind it was 59%, immediately after the inauguration, then it started to plummet
[56:54.440 --> 56:59.720]  as we saw Rasmussen, which is normally quite friendly to Trump in terms of poll numbers,
[56:59.720 --> 57:05.000]  had him down to 42% at the lowest point, Gallup had him lower than that.
[57:05.000 --> 57:11.200]  Now as a result of these war drums beating his back up to 50%, but what's key is when
[57:11.200 --> 57:15.960]  you drill down into these stats, and this is an article up on Zero Hedge, which talks
[57:15.960 --> 57:23.480]  about it, headlined war works, Trump favorability hits 50% highest in two months and they go
[57:23.480 --> 57:29.000]  a bit deeper than Rasmussen, they drill into it and find that if you ask people, did Trump
[57:29.000 --> 57:30.840]  keep his promises?
[57:30.840 --> 57:37.960]  If you ask people on February 1st to 5th, if Trump kept his promises, 62% said yes.
[57:37.960 --> 57:45.760]  But now, April 5th to 9th has Trump kept his promises, 45% say yes.
[57:45.760 --> 57:51.280]  So it's down by 17%, you can see the other barometers, if you scroll down a little further
[57:51.280 --> 57:55.080]  there into that article, is Trump a strong and decisive leader?
[57:55.080 --> 57:59.040]  Even that has dropped 7 points, can he bring about changes this country needs, that has
[57:59.040 --> 58:00.880]  dropped 7 points.
[58:00.880 --> 58:05.560]  So when you actually get into the nitty gritty, into the details, this doesn't make good
[58:05.560 --> 58:11.360]  reading, but generally speaking, his approval rating has gone up to 50%, we're going to
[58:11.360 --> 58:16.480]  get into that with Lionel, we're going to talk about Syria and North Korea, as well
[58:16.480 --> 58:23.400]  as Google censorship, delisting of infowars.com, huge issues coming up, we're also going to
[58:23.400 --> 58:27.800]  get into the battle of Berkeley and what happened with Antifa.
[58:27.800 --> 58:35.600]  This is the Alex Jones Show Live breaking news at infowars.com, we'll be back.
[58:35.600 --> 59:00.760]  You are listening to GCN, visit GCNLive.com today.

[59:27.640 --> 59:31.520]  multi-vitamin mineral products, and this part is most important.

[59:36.780 --> 59:38.440]  quality lab standard.
[59:38.440 --> 59:42.440]  That means it's clean, that means it's pure, and rest-secured, you're funding the tip of

[1:00:28.640 --> 1:00:30.640]  We are live on the Alex Jones Show.
[1:00:30.640 --> 1:00:36.000]  We have Lionel coming up in the next segment with his scholarly, analytical take on current
[1:00:36.000 --> 1:00:37.000]  affairs.
[1:00:37.000 --> 1:00:39.600]  We're going to delve back into the North Korea News.
[1:00:39.600 --> 1:00:43.440]  In a moment, we have more escalation, more tension in the region.
[1:00:43.440 --> 1:00:47.680]  We're going to talk about the French election, the first round of which is coming up here
[1:00:47.680 --> 1:00:49.360]  in six days' time.
[1:00:49.360 --> 1:00:54.800]  Can Marine Le Pen come out on top and get that momentum that will take her into the
[1:00:54.800 --> 1:00:58.040]  second round, give her a chance at victory?
[1:00:58.040 --> 1:01:02.880]  Before we get into that, I want to tell you about the Easter Mega Specials extended at
[1:01:02.880 --> 1:01:06.280]  infowarslives.com for a limited time only.
[1:01:06.280 --> 1:01:10.840]  As you heard from Alex at the start of the show, we're under constant barrage.
[1:01:10.840 --> 1:01:17.120]  The intensification of these attacks has never been more sustained, more intense than it
[1:01:17.120 --> 1:01:18.480]  is right now.
[1:01:18.480 --> 1:01:20.440]  We depend on your support more than ever.
[1:01:20.440 --> 1:01:21.440]  That's not a cliche.
[1:01:21.440 --> 1:01:24.960]  It's this getting really down to the wire now.
[1:01:24.960 --> 1:01:26.960]  The red line has been crossed.
[1:01:26.960 --> 1:01:29.680]  They're targeting us financially.
[1:01:29.680 --> 1:01:32.560]  So we have the extended specials at infowarslives.com.
[1:01:32.560 --> 1:01:35.640]  We have 30% off brain force.
[1:01:35.640 --> 1:01:42.200]  I just popped two of these about 30 minutes ago again, jet lagged, two hours sleep.
[1:01:42.200 --> 1:01:43.200]  That's going to pick you up.
[1:01:43.200 --> 1:01:45.200]  That's going to give you mental clarity.

[1:01:50.800 --> 1:01:54.960]  Again, mental acuity, mental clarity.
[1:01:54.960 --> 1:01:56.360]  It's not a speedy effect.
[1:01:56.360 --> 1:01:58.120]  It's not a junky effect.
[1:01:58.120 --> 1:01:59.680]  It just pushes you through.
[1:01:59.680 --> 1:02:03.840]  And especially if you're hosting a three-hour radio show with massive bright light shining
[1:02:03.840 --> 1:02:07.680]  on your face with two hours sleep, that is a huge help.
[1:02:07.680 --> 1:02:13.400]  So for any task like that, any intensive task, brain force is going to be an absolute wonder
[1:02:13.400 --> 1:02:14.400]  for you.
[1:02:14.400 --> 1:02:16.080]  30% off.
[1:02:16.080 --> 1:02:17.440]  That special is extended.
[1:02:17.440 --> 1:02:21.880]  We have 25% off supermail vitality.
[1:02:21.880 --> 1:02:26.080]  And we have here another five-star review, which was posted on infowarslives.com.
[1:02:26.080 --> 1:02:32.120]  Again, independent five-star review, supermail vitality, blew me away.
[1:02:32.120 --> 1:02:33.120]  Wow.
[1:02:33.120 --> 1:02:35.160]  I've been dabbling in herbology for the last several years.
[1:02:35.160 --> 1:02:40.800]  I know that supplements like these are usually diluted, diluted, and the only quality products
[1:02:40.800 --> 1:02:42.000]  get real results.
[1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:44.920]  This is an independent review of supermail vitality.
[1:02:44.920 --> 1:02:48.520]  I've been wanting to try this supermail vitality for a while, and with the confidence I have
[1:02:48.520 --> 1:02:51.880]  in Alex Jones, if he says it works, then it does.
[1:02:51.880 --> 1:02:52.880]  No lie.
[1:02:52.880 --> 1:02:54.320]  This supplement is powerful.
[1:02:54.320 --> 1:02:56.200]  What an incredible feeling this gives.
[1:02:56.200 --> 1:03:02.120]  I can only describe it as focus and happiness with a side of high-quality energy without
[1:03:02.120 --> 1:03:03.120]  jitters.
[1:03:03.120 --> 1:03:05.160]  And that's what we hear over and over again.
[1:03:05.160 --> 1:03:08.160]  This isn't a junkie-speed-like feeling.
[1:03:08.160 --> 1:03:12.560]  Like I used to take a different neutropic, similar to brain force, and that kind of gave
[1:03:12.560 --> 1:03:17.360]  you the heart-racing feeling, which you really don't want.
[1:03:17.360 --> 1:03:18.440]  Brain force doesn't do that.
[1:03:18.440 --> 1:03:19.840]  Supermail vitality doesn't do that.
[1:03:19.840 --> 1:03:26.360]  We have 25% off with the special extended at infowarslives.com.
[1:03:26.360 --> 1:03:33.960]  In mineral fusion, 25% off, secret 12, vitamin B12, 25% off, superfemale vitality, also 25%
[1:03:33.960 --> 1:03:39.280]  off, as is survival shield X2, and many others at infowarslives.com.
[1:03:39.280 --> 1:03:41.920]  Again, five-star independent reviews.
[1:03:41.920 --> 1:03:49.560]  We depend on your support now, more than ever, as we are under constant assault by the establishment
[1:03:49.560 --> 1:03:52.800]  on a daily basis.
[1:03:52.800 --> 1:03:57.440]  Examples coming up, let's hit a couple of news stories in the final minute of this segment.
[1:03:57.440 --> 1:04:02.160]  Era of strategic patience by U.S. towards North Korea is over.
[1:04:02.160 --> 1:04:05.280]  That's Mike Pence, who of course is in South Korea right now.
[1:04:05.280 --> 1:04:10.240]  He announced the end of strategic patience towards Pyongyang, adding that all options
[1:04:10.240 --> 1:04:11.400]  are on the table.
[1:04:11.400 --> 1:04:17.400]  Pence spoke on Monday while visiting the demilitarized zone separating the two Koreas.
[1:04:17.400 --> 1:04:24.880]  And zero hedge reports on top of that Trump-considering kinetic military action on North Korea, including
[1:04:24.880 --> 1:04:26.880]  sudden strike.
[1:04:26.880 --> 1:04:29.120]  So there's not going to be any warning whatsoever.
[1:04:29.120 --> 1:04:33.240]  This is the main contention that South Korea and Japan have got.
[1:04:33.240 --> 1:04:38.840]  They said to Trump, if you're going to strike North Korea, you have to talk to us first.
[1:04:38.840 --> 1:04:41.760]  Now it looks like that is not going to happen.
[1:04:41.760 --> 1:04:46.200]  If there is a strike, it will be a complete surprise to North Korea, to South Korea,
[1:04:46.200 --> 1:04:48.400]  to Japan, to everyone.
[1:04:48.400 --> 1:04:51.320]  And how quickly will that escalate tensions in the region?
[1:04:51.320 --> 1:04:55.680]  We'll continue to track it, but we will be back in the next segment with Lionel, breaking
[1:04:55.680 --> 1:04:56.680]  news at Infowars.com.
[1:04:56.680 --> 1:04:57.680]  Don't go away.
[1:04:57.680 --> 1:05:25.680]  We'll see you in the next segment.
[1:05:25.680 --> 1:05:29.680]  If you violate a lease, that is between you and your leaseholder, but now the government
[1:05:29.680 --> 1:05:32.520]  has a preemptive strike against the Airbnb host.
[1:05:32.520 --> 1:05:37.280]  You can be sure this is a result of the hotel industry lobbying our fine politicians.
[1:05:37.280 --> 1:05:41.880]  Linda Rosenthal, a Manhattan Democrat who sponsored the bill, said, this sets a standard
[1:05:41.880 --> 1:05:46.320]  for those struggling with the impact of Airbnb on affordable housing, which doesn't even
[1:05:46.320 --> 1:05:49.880]  make sense because innovation and competition always lowers costs.
[1:05:49.880 --> 1:05:52.000]  But these are Democrats we're talking about here.
[1:05:52.000 --> 1:05:54.600]  So don't bother trying to progress an industry.
[1:05:54.600 --> 1:05:56.440]  The Democrats are waiting to stop you.
[1:05:56.440 --> 1:05:58.640]  For Infowars.com, this is Owen Schreuer.
[1:05:58.640 --> 1:06:02.480]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back
[1:06:02.480 --> 1:06:04.360]  in stock at Infowars.com.
[1:06:04.360 --> 1:06:06.520]  Research across the board is clear.
[1:06:06.520 --> 1:06:10.480]  When bacteria infect your gums, it can enter your bloodstream, and even contribute to blood
[1:06:10.480 --> 1:06:11.880]  clots and heart attacks.
[1:06:11.880 --> 1:06:16.480]  That's why the Last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that your oral health
[1:06:16.480 --> 1:06:19.240]  can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[1:06:19.240 --> 1:06:23.680]  Super Blue fluoride-free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula that's loaded with good halogen
[1:06:23.680 --> 1:06:26.360]  iodide, instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[1:06:26.360 --> 1:06:30.880]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out
[1:06:30.880 --> 1:06:33.440]  bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[1:06:33.440 --> 1:06:38.040]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue, chosen by our dental experts include xylitol,
[1:06:38.040 --> 1:06:41.000]  peppermint oil, iodine, nano-silver, and more.
[1:06:41.000 --> 1:06:44.880]  Due to requests from listeners who found that spearmint was a little bit too strong for some
[1:06:44.880 --> 1:06:49.440]  of their children, we have created the new Bubble Gum flavored Super Blue that is spearmint-free.
[1:06:49.440 --> 1:06:53.520]  Learn more about the new Bubble Gum flavored Super Blue toothpaste and more at Infowars

[1:07:12.360 --> 1:07:13.360]  very, very soon.

[1:07:20.960 --> 1:07:26.120]  The secret behind DNA Force is its powerful lineup of patented ingredients like CoQ-Tin,

[1:07:30.600 --> 1:07:36.200]  BioPQQ alone is backed by an unprecedented 175 clinical studies, and just one batch of
[1:07:36.200 --> 1:07:39.080]  this stuff costs us more than $30,000.

[1:08:25.360 --> 1:08:37.560]  We are live on the Alex Jones show and we have our guest, Lionel.
[1:08:37.560 --> 1:08:42.120]  We're going to cover a huge gamut of issues over the next 50 minutes or so.
[1:08:42.120 --> 1:08:44.280]  Here's a commentator and radio host.
[1:08:44.280 --> 1:08:46.720]  The website is lionelmedia.com.
[1:08:46.720 --> 1:08:50.800]  You can find him on Twitter at Lionelmedia Lionel.
[1:08:50.800 --> 1:08:51.800]  It's been a while.
[1:08:51.800 --> 1:08:52.800]  Welcome back.
[1:08:52.800 --> 1:08:53.800]  Thank you.
[1:08:53.800 --> 1:08:54.800]  Thank you.
[1:08:54.800 --> 1:09:03.840]  I just also add, because I'm following your footsteps, my YouTube channel at LionelNation.
[1:09:03.840 --> 1:09:05.920]  LionelNation on YouTube.
[1:09:05.920 --> 1:09:07.800]  Go and check that out.
[1:09:07.800 --> 1:09:09.520]  Building his YouTube channel there.
[1:09:09.520 --> 1:09:12.520]  Again vital to have that reach across all these different platforms.
[1:09:12.520 --> 1:09:18.080]  Lionel, I want to start with North Korea because we were covering the fact that basically
[1:09:18.080 --> 1:09:22.640]  Trump has said he won't talk to Japan and South Korea if there is a military attack
[1:09:22.640 --> 1:09:23.640]  on North Korea.
[1:09:23.640 --> 1:09:28.960]  We have said all along, before anything happens, you need to talk to us first.
[1:09:28.960 --> 1:09:31.680]  That looks like it's not going to happen.
[1:09:31.680 --> 1:09:35.880]  We have it tied in with the Syrian narrative, you know, that Trump was right to bomb Assad
[1:09:35.880 --> 1:09:40.240]  in Syria, but that sent a strong message to North Korea.
[1:09:40.240 --> 1:09:42.200]  It seems to have worked at least domestically.
[1:09:42.200 --> 1:09:44.360]  His poll number is back up to 50%.
[1:09:44.360 --> 1:09:49.160]  Do you think the two issues of North Korea and Syria can be separated or should they
[1:09:49.160 --> 1:09:54.160]  be treated as one grand narrative?
[1:09:54.160 --> 1:09:58.000]  Well first and foremost, I don't believe anything I read in the newspaper or newspapers
[1:09:58.000 --> 1:10:01.840]  or media, listen to me, newspapers, I'm being rather anachronistic here, I don't believe
[1:10:01.840 --> 1:10:03.160]  anything that I hear.
[1:10:03.160 --> 1:10:08.520]  I think that very frankly, President Trump and T. Rex Tillerson and others are getting
[1:10:08.520 --> 1:10:13.320]  a little bit, feeling pretty good getting those numbers bumped.
[1:10:13.320 --> 1:10:17.040]  Let's face it, they've been catching grief left and right and all of a sudden when you
[1:10:17.040 --> 1:10:22.320]  start rattling those sabers and talking about fighting back and dropping moabs.
[1:10:22.320 --> 1:10:26.800]  By the way, this is a mother of all broadcasting right now, but when you talk about that and
[1:10:26.800 --> 1:10:32.080]  you talk about death and destruction and the usual, dare I say this, this phallic referencing,
[1:10:32.080 --> 1:10:39.160]  you know, it has tremendous benefits for poll numbers and the like, and I think very frankly,
[1:10:39.160 --> 1:10:43.320]  the president's human and his political folks are human, so they're going to ratchet up
[1:10:43.320 --> 1:10:45.920]  this kind of speech.
[1:10:45.920 --> 1:10:49.800]  Really, as I said, I don't believe anything.
[1:10:49.800 --> 1:10:55.000]  And what I don't also believe is that this country has never understood, and I can't
[1:10:55.000 --> 1:10:59.440]  believe I'm saying this, but nobody ever wants to think about North Korea's perspective.
[1:10:59.440 --> 1:11:06.000]  You know, there's a wonderful scholastic, academic by the name of Bruce Cummings from
[1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:12.000]  the University of Chicago to explain this CUM, 1M Cummings to explain the history and
[1:11:12.000 --> 1:11:13.680]  the background of North Korea.
[1:11:13.680 --> 1:11:17.800]  And I would venture to say, Paul, the most Americans have no idea, they're told that
[1:11:17.800 --> 1:11:23.360]  Kim Jong-un is an idiot, he's insane, he's a syphilitic or crazy or whatever he's doing,
[1:11:23.360 --> 1:11:30.520]  he's a man child, he's a lunatic, they're starvation, and they will believe this.
[1:11:30.520 --> 1:11:36.320]  So what I do hope, and I would be less than honest if I didn't say there isn't a part
[1:11:36.320 --> 1:11:41.840]  of me that says, you know, if we could somehow, perhaps by virtue of some kind of cyber shenanigans,
[1:11:41.840 --> 1:11:48.360]  disengage or denude someone, disengorge some of them of their ability to detonate a nuclear
[1:11:48.360 --> 1:11:55.960]  bomb potentially, I'd be less than candid if I didn't say there's a part of that thought
[1:11:55.960 --> 1:11:57.440]  there was a good idea.
[1:11:57.440 --> 1:12:01.320]  However, we're now doing cyber attacks.
[1:12:01.320 --> 1:12:05.520]  So how are we going to be talking to somebody else who dares to implement the same against
[1:12:05.520 --> 1:12:06.520]  us?
[1:12:06.520 --> 1:12:08.480]  Dare I say Dread Russia or whatever.
[1:12:08.480 --> 1:12:10.120]  So it's very, very complicated.
[1:12:10.120 --> 1:12:13.880]  I'm sure that we will work through this.
[1:12:13.880 --> 1:12:17.320]  But Paul, I don't believe anything I hear or read.
[1:12:17.320 --> 1:12:22.800]  No, it's also, you know, something that I've thought about many times is North Koreans,
[1:12:22.800 --> 1:12:25.360]  the people themselves are kind of dehumanized.
[1:12:25.360 --> 1:12:29.920]  People don't realize that, you know, you're not just wiping out a horrible regime, which
[1:12:29.920 --> 1:12:30.920]  it is.
[1:12:30.920 --> 1:12:35.520]  You're wiping out millions of people who are brainwashed victims in their heart of hearts.
[1:12:35.520 --> 1:12:37.720]  We know they don't support dear leader.
[1:12:37.720 --> 1:12:39.000]  We know that they're forced to do so.
[1:12:39.000 --> 1:12:46.120]  You have a network in North Korea of 200,000 people in concentration camps, basically thought
[1:12:46.120 --> 1:12:47.120]  criminals.
[1:12:47.120 --> 1:12:51.240]  These people have criticized the government or somebody's reported them for not showing
[1:12:51.240 --> 1:12:53.600]  enough worship for dear leader.
[1:12:53.600 --> 1:12:57.200]  You know, you have horrible atrocities being committed in these camps.
[1:12:57.200 --> 1:12:58.920]  You know, these people are victims too.
[1:12:58.920 --> 1:13:02.840]  It's not, it's not as if they're right behind dear leader and that they're falling.
[1:13:02.840 --> 1:13:07.640]  They only support him outwardly because if they didn't, they'd be thrown in a camp with
[1:13:07.640 --> 1:13:09.560]  all their entire family.
[1:13:09.560 --> 1:13:14.280]  So when people talk about bombing North Korea, it's very, you know, it's very flagrant
[1:13:14.280 --> 1:13:19.000]  and it doesn't account for the fact that these are victims themselves, right?
[1:13:19.000 --> 1:13:25.360]  But also, yes, well, again, and I don't want to keep saying this, I believe this to be
[1:13:25.360 --> 1:13:26.360]  true.
[1:13:26.360 --> 1:13:29.320]  I mean, I have been so bamboozled.
[1:13:29.320 --> 1:13:36.360]  I have been so lied to, represent mass destruction, you name it, so okay, I'll give you that
[1:13:36.360 --> 1:13:37.360]  one.
[1:13:37.360 --> 1:13:38.880]  There's a little bit more.
[1:13:38.880 --> 1:13:44.040]  This is a, as others have said, North Korea is a garrisoned country.
[1:13:44.040 --> 1:13:49.040]  This is, this is a country where virtually everybody is or has been in the military.
[1:13:49.040 --> 1:13:55.440]  But an average of 10 years of experience, there is underground since 1945.
[1:13:55.440 --> 1:13:58.280]  They have been building and preparing.
[1:13:58.280 --> 1:14:06.000]  They have, they have been at war or the threat of war, almost their entire existence.
[1:14:06.000 --> 1:14:08.000]  So we're talking caves.
[1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:15.360]  We're talking an ability to fight the likes of which we have not seen before.
[1:14:15.360 --> 1:14:17.440]  Understand who this army is.
[1:14:17.440 --> 1:14:24.520]  There's also this idea that South Korea is nirvana, you know, Shangri-La.
[1:14:24.520 --> 1:14:26.560]  Not necessarily so.
[1:14:26.560 --> 1:14:39.000]  So what, what my, my concern is, is that when you have Paul, nothing but exercises and war
[1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:43.160]  games and saber rattling in South Korea all the time.
[1:14:43.160 --> 1:14:47.080]  Let me ask you something, because you're a bright man despite your jet lag and the fact
[1:14:47.080 --> 1:14:53.160]  that you haven't slept in 14 days, do you think that maybe, just maybe we might be precipitating
[1:14:53.160 --> 1:14:59.160]  some type of, of, of, of battle by constantly reminding folks, we're right here.
[1:14:59.160 --> 1:15:04.760]  And in this era of nuclear bombs, do people think, like in the era of when you could
[1:15:04.760 --> 1:15:09.600]  smoke on an airplane or people thought that they spoke would go up to aisle 16 or seat
[1:15:09.600 --> 1:15:11.520]  and then stop?
[1:15:11.520 --> 1:15:12.520]  Nuclear fallout.
[1:15:12.520 --> 1:15:17.640]  Do, do we have, have we lost sight of what we're talking about here?
[1:15:17.640 --> 1:15:25.280]  So while this is terrific, and while everybody universally loathes, hates, derides, abhors
[1:15:25.280 --> 1:15:32.040]  this, this, this crazed despotic ruler, the more everybody speaks in unison, I'm sorry
[1:15:32.040 --> 1:15:35.560]  if I didn't say this, the more suspect I am of the truth.
[1:15:35.560 --> 1:15:38.000]  Because you understand something because John Pilters has never believed anything unless
[1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:39.880]  it's officially denied.
[1:15:39.880 --> 1:15:41.920]  And I don't believe anything.
[1:15:41.920 --> 1:15:49.000]  I don't believe, and there's no pro North Korea contingent, but I don't believe this.
[1:15:49.000 --> 1:15:50.960]  It's as though you want me to believe this.
[1:15:50.960 --> 1:15:57.920]  You want me to sign on to war with North Korea and how exactly is that to take place?
[1:15:57.920 --> 1:15:58.920]  Is it limited?
[1:15:58.920 --> 1:15:59.920]  We thought about this.
[1:15:59.920 --> 1:16:04.960]  And Paul, when you have somebody by the name of Mad Dog Mattis, as the architect of your
[1:16:04.960 --> 1:16:12.200]  defense policy, is there not a part of you that's just a tad bit concerned?
[1:16:12.200 --> 1:16:15.160]  I mean, I mean, it's incredible how lightly it's treated.
[1:16:15.160 --> 1:16:16.520]  Oh, it's just a nuclear war.
[1:16:16.520 --> 1:16:18.560]  It's just a regional nuclear war.
[1:16:18.560 --> 1:16:20.360]  You know, how are people going to deal with that?
[1:16:20.360 --> 1:16:23.320]  You've got millennials on Twitter who have mental breakdowns.
[1:16:23.320 --> 1:16:27.400]  If you tag them in a tweet, how are they going to deal with an actual nuclear war?
[1:16:27.400 --> 1:16:30.200]  Now, of course, it, you know, it might not conflate with the US.
[1:16:30.200 --> 1:16:34.040]  They might not be under direct assault under direct threat.
[1:16:34.040 --> 1:16:39.200]  But again, how are people actually going to cope with that given they can't cope with
[1:16:39.200 --> 1:16:40.200]  mean tweets?
[1:16:40.200 --> 1:16:42.200]  May I say something for a minute?
[1:16:42.200 --> 1:16:46.640]  And I know this sounds very gratuitous, but being gratuitous doesn't mean it's not true.
[1:16:46.640 --> 1:16:58.200]  You have been dangerously, diabolically, evilly, there is a brilliant in your YouTube, uh,
[1:16:58.200 --> 1:17:08.640]  acquisitions on snowflakes, SJWs, this spineless group of invertebrates, these little powder
[1:17:08.640 --> 1:17:15.400]  puffs who, who show, you know, Paul, in my generation, when I was a kid, I remember kind
[1:17:15.400 --> 1:17:18.960]  of like the end of, I mean, I missed the Vietnam war by this much.
[1:17:18.960 --> 1:17:23.320]  The left was anti-war, tough.
[1:17:23.320 --> 1:17:31.880]  The left was dirty jokes, provocative stuff, underground, uh, porn, I mean, blue movie,
[1:17:31.880 --> 1:17:32.880]  listen to me.
[1:17:32.880 --> 1:17:34.760]  It was cutting edge.
[1:17:34.760 --> 1:17:36.240]  It was the right.
[1:17:36.240 --> 1:17:38.760]  It was the adults who said, stop saying that.
[1:17:38.760 --> 1:17:39.760]  Oh, you're dirty.
[1:17:39.760 --> 1:17:40.760]  Oh, you're hateful.
[1:17:40.760 --> 1:17:41.760]  Stop.
[1:17:41.760 --> 1:17:47.720]  The left was cutting edge and it was music that talked about war and we voted.
[1:17:47.720 --> 1:17:53.960]  Even when we or they protested, you didn't scratch your head and said, this man, this
[1:17:53.960 --> 1:17:59.360]  woman is walking around with foam rubber in Gorge, Genitalia and Pudenda.
[1:17:59.360 --> 1:18:06.040]  This woman's wearing a knit cap that apparently is some for, we're asking, what the hell are
[1:18:06.040 --> 1:18:09.400]  these people even, what are they marching for?
[1:18:09.400 --> 1:18:18.160]  And you have so perfectly targeted these, these imbecilic Cretans, these Biosians, who
[1:18:18.160 --> 1:18:23.160]  do they know anything this weekend in New York?
[1:18:23.160 --> 1:18:30.000]  They were protesting, not false flag attacks in Syria, not more war, not Trump going back
[1:18:30.000 --> 1:18:34.520]  on his word, as he said, not the MAGA make America great.
[1:18:34.520 --> 1:18:35.840]  Oh, no, no, no.
[1:18:35.840 --> 1:18:37.080]  They weren't talking about that.
[1:18:37.080 --> 1:18:40.200]  No, no, they were protesting Trump's tax returns.
[1:18:40.200 --> 1:18:42.520]  What the hell are they talking about?
[1:18:42.520 --> 1:18:49.120]  Their tax returns, what, what, do they, has anybody, do they read anything?
[1:18:49.120 --> 1:18:56.080]  Is this, did they sign up for this, like when you rent a hall for a wedding?
[1:18:56.080 --> 1:18:59.320]  I got the deposit down, Maya's will have the wedding.
[1:18:59.320 --> 1:19:03.280]  Did they arrange that day for protests and they can't go back on their word?
[1:19:03.280 --> 1:19:08.840]  I mean, where, who are these people, do they know what's going on?
[1:19:08.840 --> 1:19:16.120]  And by the way, the staunch, if you want to call it the right, the mindless Trump acolyte,
[1:19:16.120 --> 1:19:20.680]  and there are some of those, have forgotten why they voted for him.
[1:19:20.680 --> 1:19:24.800]  So my dear friend Paul, I think we are in the middle of what appears to be an insane
[1:19:24.800 --> 1:19:30.560]  asylum from clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right.
[1:19:30.560 --> 1:19:34.280]  Here we are stuck in the middle with you to quote the great Jerry Rafferty.
[1:19:34.280 --> 1:19:35.280]  It's insane.
[1:19:35.280 --> 1:19:37.440]  It is a kind of pincer movement.
[1:19:37.440 --> 1:19:39.920]  We've got insanity on all sides of the equation.
[1:19:39.920 --> 1:19:42.640]  We'll be back to talk about it with Lionel after the break.

[1:19:49.400 --> 1:19:52.280]  We will talk about it in the next segment with Lionel.
[1:19:52.280 --> 1:19:55.120]  This is the Alex Jones Show Live in Four Wars dot com.
[1:19:55.120 --> 1:19:56.120]  We'll be back.

[1:20:59.520 --> 1:21:03.600]  Your community's aging water infrastructure systems are very likely to be contaminated
[1:21:03.600 --> 1:21:08.640]  with heavy metals like lead, disinfection chemicals like ammonia, chlorine and chloramines,
[1:21:08.640 --> 1:21:11.480]  and pharmaceuticals like statins, pain meds and antidepressants.
[1:21:11.480 --> 1:21:16.480]  And no, water treatment plants are not equipped to filter these pharmaceutical toxins out.

[1:22:57.320 --> 1:23:01.240]  Many books have been written regarding the law of attraction, but what if all these books
[1:23:01.240 --> 1:23:05.040]  are missing the most important information we can use when it comes to activating this
[1:23:05.040 --> 1:23:06.600]  law in our lives?

[1:23:51.360 --> 1:24:10.640]  Visit NewEnglandSHER.com today, NewEnglandSHER.com.
[1:24:10.640 --> 1:24:28.120]  We are live on the Alex Jones Show talking to Lionel, the website is Lionelmedia.com.
[1:24:28.120 --> 1:24:31.640]  Let's stick on geopolitics, let's just round up there.
[1:24:31.640 --> 1:24:36.360]  We have the New York Times and I think you just put out a video Lionel called The Mainstream
[1:24:36.360 --> 1:24:41.800]  Media is the Enemy of the People on this kind of subject, The New York Times as Thomas Friedman
[1:24:41.800 --> 1:24:47.200]  came out with an article and this is up on the Gateway Pundit, there's a headline, media
[1:24:47.200 --> 1:24:52.480]  turns liberal mainstream outlets openly siding with ISIS over Trump.
[1:24:52.480 --> 1:24:57.280]  This was Thomas Friedman, New York Times, he writes that Trump should not fight ISIS.
[1:24:57.280 --> 1:25:04.840]  Quo, the same way we encourage the Mujahideen fighters to bleed Russia in Afghanistan.
[1:25:04.840 --> 1:25:12.280]  So you have a major New York Times writer openly calling for Trump to leave ISIS alone
[1:25:12.280 --> 1:25:16.760]  in the same way that we didn't just leave the Mujahideen alone of course in Afghanistan,
[1:25:16.760 --> 1:25:18.680]  we gave them the weapons.
[1:25:18.680 --> 1:25:23.160]  We've seen this from the very beginning when they said openly, let's just back the Al Qaeda
[1:25:23.160 --> 1:25:28.640]  rebels in Syria, I mean Lionel why is the establishment, which after all you know embraced
[1:25:28.640 --> 1:25:34.040]  this attack on Assad last week, they loved it, they immediately forgave Trump for many
[1:25:34.040 --> 1:25:39.280]  of his sins in the immediate aftermath of this Tomahawk missile attack.
[1:25:39.280 --> 1:25:44.160]  Why are they now openly encouraging him to allow the spread of a Jihadist army that has
[1:25:44.160 --> 1:25:47.160]  terrorized an entire continent?
[1:25:47.160 --> 1:25:52.360]  Well let me see if I can give you an adult and a cogent answer because they're stupid
[1:25:52.360 --> 1:26:00.200]  because Americans are, no no, stupid, don't read, don't care, don't wonder, they're
[1:26:00.200 --> 1:26:06.760]  incurious, they know more about sports, they knew more about Tom Brady's underinflated
[1:26:06.760 --> 1:26:10.240]  footballs than they do what's going on.
[1:26:10.240 --> 1:26:15.680]  And what Tom Friedman did, and I am rather, let's face it like the great Gorvid Al said,
[1:26:15.680 --> 1:26:19.040]  I'm not a conspiracy theorist, I'm a conspiracy analyst.
[1:26:19.040 --> 1:26:24.680]  I think somebody went backstage at the New York Times and said, hey Tommy, do me a favor,
[1:26:24.680 --> 1:26:28.640]  I'll bet you, I want you to see how big your CO Jones are.
[1:26:28.640 --> 1:26:34.880]  I want you to write an article basically telling the world that we are using, that the West
[1:26:34.880 --> 1:26:39.480]  is using ISIS deliberately, that they are ours.
[1:26:39.480 --> 1:26:45.600]  Put this in an article and I will bet you that nobody is smart enough to realize what
[1:26:45.600 --> 1:26:46.600]  you've just done.
[1:26:46.600 --> 1:26:58.040]  In this article he basically admits and explains that ISIS is a tool, a tool, ISIS that beheads
[1:26:58.040 --> 1:27:08.640]  kills, slaughters, Christians, ISIS, the same people, that is the, I mean the embodiment
[1:27:08.640 --> 1:27:14.720]  of the boogeyman, he writes in there that basically it's an inside job, it's basically
[1:27:14.720 --> 1:27:19.240]  like professional wrestling, and nobody says anything.
[1:27:19.240 --> 1:27:26.480]  This was a test, this was a say, my God, do they read us, do they care about us, is anybody
[1:27:26.480 --> 1:27:32.600]  paying attention to us, or do they just not know, I mean Paul, I'm still reeling from
[1:27:32.600 --> 1:27:33.600]  that.
[1:27:33.600 --> 1:27:43.680]  I can't believe he was allowed to say that, frame that, that is the blueprint of what's
[1:27:43.680 --> 1:27:45.200]  going on.
[1:27:45.200 --> 1:27:50.200]  This is amazing, and also, I was doing a radio show this morning, give an example, and I'm
[1:27:50.200 --> 1:27:54.160]  sure you've done this too because people think I'm nuts, could be for different reasons,
[1:27:54.160 --> 1:28:00.960]  but, and I said, well, this subject, this is a news radio program, all right.
[1:28:00.960 --> 1:28:06.280]  I said, well, you do realize that there are a lot of people, myself included, who believe
[1:28:06.280 --> 1:28:12.440]  that the whole gas pack was basically a false flag, that it was contrived, it was staged,
[1:28:12.440 --> 1:28:17.480]  it was orchestrated, as it was in 2013, Syhur said this, we have evidence of this, we know,
[1:28:17.480 --> 1:28:21.320]  it's part of their MO, and you could hear the crickets, it was like somebody said cue
[1:28:21.320 --> 1:28:25.680]  the crickets, and I said, did you hear what I said, where the hell have you been?
[1:28:25.680 --> 1:28:28.120]  Paul, am I living in a parallel universe?
[1:28:28.120 --> 1:28:34.080]  Have you and Alex and others deluded me into thinking that somehow everybody knows what
[1:28:34.080 --> 1:28:35.080]  we know?
[1:28:35.080 --> 1:28:41.880]  Am I walking around in some kind of a cosmic psychotic fugue, where am I the only one?
[1:28:41.880 --> 1:28:48.280]  I'm not talking to a guy in the corner, I'm talking to a newspaper, a radio host who says,
[1:28:48.280 --> 1:28:52.880]  well, did you see the pictures of the dead babies and the dead kids?
[1:28:52.880 --> 1:28:53.880]  Yes!
[1:28:53.880 --> 1:28:54.880]  Yes!
[1:28:54.880 --> 1:28:59.760]  That's the thing, Lionel, over and over again, it's this appeal to sentimentality and emotion,
[1:28:59.760 --> 1:29:05.600]  yes, it's tragic, but it can still be tragic and be a different narrative from what you're
[1:29:05.600 --> 1:29:06.600]  telling us.
[1:29:06.600 --> 1:29:10.440]  The fact that we question the narrative doesn't mean that it's not tragic, doesn't mean that
[1:29:10.440 --> 1:29:15.960]  it's not horrific to see children dying, yes, people died, but there was no investigation
[1:29:15.960 --> 1:29:20.920]  whatsoever, Robert Parry, who is a major journalist, came out and said it looked like an explosion
[1:29:20.920 --> 1:29:23.400]  on the ground, not an ordinance drop from above.
[1:29:23.400 --> 1:29:29.920]  Again, no actual independent investigation, we're not diminishing the scale of the horror,
[1:29:29.920 --> 1:29:33.400]  they try and pull that card over and over again, we're going to come back Lionel in
[1:29:33.400 --> 1:29:36.560]  the next segment and talk about it, we're going to talk about what happened in Cleveland
[1:29:36.560 --> 1:29:41.720]  and the French election coming up in six days time, this is the Alex Jones Show Live breaking
[1:29:41.720 --> 1:29:48.320]  news at infowalls.com, we'll be back.
[1:29:48.320 --> 1:29:59.360]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:29:59.360 --> 1:30:00.920]  Want to stop progress?
[1:30:00.920 --> 1:30:02.640]  Contact your local Progressive Democrat.
[1:30:02.640 --> 1:30:07.440]  With Airbnb rising in popularity, the hotel industry is freaking out and Progressive Democrats
[1:30:07.440 --> 1:30:08.440]  are responding.
[1:30:08.440 --> 1:30:12.680]  First, the Federal Trade Commission requested an investigation be done into how Airbnb was
[1:30:12.680 --> 1:30:16.880]  affecting the housing market, why waste our money on that, I'm not sure, but Governor
[1:30:16.880 --> 1:30:22.080]  of New York Andrew Cuomo signed a bill making it a finable offense to post on Airbnb, another
[1:30:22.080 --> 1:30:25.980]  example of the government getting involved in private business where it doesn't belong.
[1:30:25.980 --> 1:30:29.800]  If you violate a lease, that is between you and your leaseholder, but now the government
[1:30:29.800 --> 1:30:32.640]  has a preemptive strike against the Airbnb host.
[1:30:32.640 --> 1:30:37.400]  You can be sure this is a result of the hotel industry lobbying our fine politicians.
[1:30:37.400 --> 1:30:42.000]  Senator Rosenthal, a Manhattan Democrat who sponsored the bill, said, this sets a standard
[1:30:42.000 --> 1:30:46.440]  for those struggling with the impact of Airbnb on affordable housing, which doesn't even
[1:30:46.440 --> 1:30:50.920]  make sense because innovation and competition always lowers cost, but these are Democrats
[1:30:50.920 --> 1:30:52.120]  we're talking about here.
[1:30:52.120 --> 1:30:56.240]  So don't bother trying to progress an industry, Progressive Democrats are waiting to stop
[1:30:56.240 --> 1:31:24.640]  you, for info wars.com, this is Owen Schreuer.
[1:31:24.640 --> 1:31:27.320]  If you're dealing with a health challenge, or if you're healthy and want to maintain

[1:32:00.600 --> 1:32:01.960]  It took you over a year to do it.
[1:32:01.960 --> 1:32:06.680]  Why is this so good because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much
[1:32:06.680 --> 1:32:08.400]  scares me the most.
[1:32:08.400 --> 1:32:13.000]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in
[1:32:13.000 --> 1:32:14.000]  my system.
[1:32:14.000 --> 1:32:19.600]  But right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your
[1:32:19.600 --> 1:32:22.060]  body that lives off a host mechanism.
[1:32:22.060 --> 1:32:27.160]  Right now with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare
[1:32:27.160 --> 1:32:28.400]  going on everywhere.

[1:32:33.360 --> 1:32:36.440]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[1:32:36.440 --> 1:32:39.680]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[1:32:39.680 --> 1:32:40.680]  All right.
[1:32:40.680 --> 1:32:42.920]  Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.

[1:33:35.600 --> 1:33:40.040]  when we went to dinner with him, of course, Alex talked about it at the top of the show.
[1:33:40.040 --> 1:33:47.320]  He will now deliberately and it's contractors conspiring to D list info wars dot com articles
[1:33:47.320 --> 1:33:53.160]  to relegate them down to a third fourth tier so they don't appear at the top of Google
[1:33:53.160 --> 1:33:58.520]  search results, which is basically the internet at this point, given the monopoly that Google
[1:33:58.520 --> 1:34:02.280]  has become absolute flagrant censorship taking place.
[1:34:02.280 --> 1:34:05.680]  We're going to get into that with Mike Cernovich before we go back to Lionel.
[1:34:05.680 --> 1:34:10.720]  I just wanted to mention again the ex Easter mega specials extended for a limited time

[1:35:38.600 --> 1:35:43.840]  at the time when we needed it the most we're being censored across the web for refusing
[1:35:43.840 --> 1:35:50.680]  to follow mainstream media propaganda we're beholden to you we're not beholden to mega
[1:35:50.680 --> 1:35:53.360]  donors who tell us what to say.
[1:35:53.360 --> 1:35:57.840]  Nobody comes in here before I go on the air and tells me what stories to cover or what
[1:35:57.840 --> 1:36:03.360]  to say about them nobody does it to Alex nobody does it to anyone here complete autonomy we're
[1:36:03.360 --> 1:36:09.840]  beholden only to you do we make mistakes we're not perfect yes we make mistakes but again
[1:36:09.840 --> 1:36:16.760]  we're not being directed we're not mouthpieces for people like George Soros we rely on you
[1:36:16.760 --> 1:36:22.080]  and you only and you have supported us greatly in the past few weeks by getting the products
[1:36:22.080 --> 1:36:27.360]  at info wars store dot com and the Easter mega specials are extended for a limited time
[1:36:27.360 --> 1:36:34.320]  only take advantage of those today at info wars store dot com Lionel we just got cut
[1:36:34.320 --> 1:36:39.240]  off there you were talking about the chemical weapons attack in Syria questions surrounding
[1:36:39.240 --> 1:36:44.800]  its authenticity or at least its origin finish up with your point then well one of the things
[1:36:44.800 --> 1:36:52.040]  which I look I don't start off questioning the fact that somebody's dead or that people
[1:36:52.040 --> 1:36:59.120]  are dying I just don't mean I'm not one of those people well I should now in 2013 remember
[1:36:59.120 --> 1:37:02.560]  a while back and this is brutal because let's make explain something fall I mean if you want
[1:37:02.560 --> 1:37:09.440]  to get if you're if you're going to basically ask that your country engage and prosecute
[1:37:09.440 --> 1:37:13.200]  a war you better know what's going on in 2013 remember when they said there was a tragedy
[1:37:13.200 --> 1:37:17.360]  in Guta and I'm not trying to make fun of this but there's a tragedy in Guta and the
[1:37:17.360 --> 1:37:23.440]  inspectors came in and said who these people yes they're decomposing who are the no somebody
[1:37:23.440 --> 1:37:28.160]  brought them in what and because the subject matter was so horrible people said oh I don't
[1:37:28.160 --> 1:37:33.360]  want to talk about this then you show the white helmets by the way George Clooney what gave
[1:37:33.360 --> 1:37:39.040]  him an Academy Award the white helmets can you believe seriously I mean does George Clooney
[1:37:39.040 --> 1:37:45.360]  does anybody say George do you what what parallel universe the white helmets don't let the white
[1:37:45.360 --> 1:37:51.360]  it's an expression they're they're handling dead people I mean well any anybody who was
[1:37:51.360 --> 1:37:58.480]  who is mildly conversant in rudimentary and a b sedarian gas specifics and basics would
[1:37:58.480 --> 1:38:03.840]  say I don't think that's the way you pick up somebody was Sharon you're going to be
[1:38:03.840 --> 1:38:08.960]  in a hazmat so every indication not to mention the MO not to mention the fact now Paul listen
[1:38:08.960 --> 1:38:13.280]  and I and by the way yeoman's work to you when I talked to you this morning you spoke
[1:38:13.280 --> 1:38:16.800]  in a Viennese accent and you were yelling who ordered the veal cutlet I don't know what was
[1:38:16.800 --> 1:38:21.040]  the matter with you you had no sleep for two weeks and you're yelling you know any M any M
[1:38:21.040 --> 1:38:25.520]  but God bless you you put a suit on you dressed up well but let's let's do a couple of things
[1:38:25.520 --> 1:38:31.920]  here can we just assume that Assad is not crazy I mean or foolish I know people use crazy now
[1:38:31.920 --> 1:38:36.800]  imagine this you're Assad and somebody says president decide you're not going to believe
[1:38:36.800 --> 1:38:42.160]  this T. Rex Tillerson the president everybody you're saying hands off Syria regimes change is
[1:38:42.160 --> 1:38:48.240]  stupid there's no reason to talk about this let's let's Syria decide get this this is a
[1:38:48.240 --> 1:38:56.080]  genius position let the Syrians decide what Syria should do okay fine not exactly genius
[1:38:56.080 --> 1:39:01.200]  but in this day and age is pretty novel so you're but Bashar al-Assad so what you do is you say
[1:39:01.200 --> 1:39:11.200]  huh I'm off the hook no hey guys I got an idea hear me out I'm going to gas my people now what
[1:39:11.200 --> 1:39:21.600]  yeah now now that basically I've averted war I because I'm insane I'm wacky I'm a lunatic
[1:39:21.600 --> 1:39:30.960]  it doesn't make any sense whatsoever and then and kudos to you again my friend what we do is
[1:39:30.960 --> 1:39:36.640]  we attack an air base now work with me on this one an air base and I would think Paul I mean
[1:39:36.640 --> 1:39:42.560]  I'm not a military genius here but I think the runways pretty important in an airbase we leave
[1:39:42.560 --> 1:39:50.000]  the runways alone okay fine but we hit kind of underneath that we hit these planes and it turns
[1:39:50.000 --> 1:39:55.840]  out that that base and sharia to whatever the pronunciation is actually protected Christian
[1:39:55.840 --> 1:40:01.600]  cities from fending off ISIS who according to Tom Friedman is really our friend because it will
[1:40:01.600 --> 1:40:12.960]  help bleed Russia Hezbollah in Iran now I'm crazy you're crazy Alex is crazy we're I'm I'm looking
[1:40:12.960 --> 1:40:20.960]  at this insanity merely asking questions and my perspective has been questioned none of this makes
[1:40:20.960 --> 1:40:28.880]  any sense and when you put your videos out and you explain this as long as you're able to do that
[1:40:28.880 --> 1:40:36.480]  as long as you're not you know arrested for speaking the truth it makes just so much sense
[1:40:36.480 --> 1:40:42.560]  none of this makes any sense and by the way Paul I gotta say this I am not a religious person I'm
[1:40:42.560 --> 1:40:48.400]  a retired Catholic and I wish nothing but people of faith all over the world peace happiness and
[1:40:48.400 --> 1:40:56.160]  whatever but yesterday especially if you follow Facebook it was he is risen he is risen Jesus
[1:40:56.160 --> 1:41:03.600]  Christ is my savior quoting everything you can imagine great good for you I like his word do
[1:41:03.600 --> 1:41:10.160]  unto others peace feed the poor wonderful wonderful these same people these cafeteria
[1:41:10.160 --> 1:41:15.360]  Christians and cafeteria Catholics all of a sudden will go from basically espousing and
[1:41:15.360 --> 1:41:20.240]  probably getting the word of Christ which is peace love helping the poor and will pivot
[1:41:20.880 --> 1:41:28.240]  into let's bomb and drop the mother of all bombs and watch as they speak almost orgasmic about
[1:41:28.880 --> 1:41:34.800]  the explosive power look at this thing look how big it is and look how we we target it and we
[1:41:34.800 --> 1:41:40.560]  showed them and we got them and I'm thinking wait a minute you just told me five minutes ago about
[1:41:40.560 --> 1:41:48.320]  God yeah yeah yeah yeah but Jesus is on our side and so it is schizophrenic disjointed none of this
[1:41:48.320 --> 1:41:54.000]  makes any sense and my beloved country my fellow Americans know nothing about his you know Tolstoy
[1:41:54.000 --> 1:41:58.880]  said history would be a wonderful thing if only it would grow and so we are just told and given
[1:41:58.880 --> 1:42:05.760]  this manikin idea but you're out of sides a bad guy this is a good guy and and Paul maybe you can
[1:42:05.760 --> 1:42:10.080]  help me out with this one I'm still trying to figure out if somebody could tell me how exactly
[1:42:10.080 --> 1:42:16.320]  did the Russians tap into and and hand the election to Trump I'm still waiting for this one so
[1:42:17.440 --> 1:42:26.480]  you and I are living in an asylum with all due respect to asylum we are in a parallel universe
[1:42:26.480 --> 1:42:34.480]  where people know nothing they just read this playbook bumper sticker cookie cutter echo chamber
[1:42:35.120 --> 1:42:42.960]  basically front page they turn to cnn and ms dnc and others they'll devote five minutes
[1:42:42.960 --> 1:42:48.720]  whenever there's bombing people clap and they know absolutely nothing and yet you're the nut
[1:42:49.360 --> 1:42:56.240]  you're the dangerous person you're the conspiracy theorist you are not them so I mean I feel
[1:42:56.240 --> 1:43:00.800]  overwhelmed just reading the news every day you can understand why they just take it from the
[1:43:00.800 --> 1:43:05.760]  from the top from the from the few headlines and don't dig in any further you can see the process
[1:43:05.760 --> 1:43:11.120]  I mean it is genuinely overwhelming okay Brian Williams by the way the only guy to get in trouble
[1:43:11.120 --> 1:43:17.360]  for lying about the iraq war think about that one the only person and he goes on and and Rachel
[1:43:17.360 --> 1:43:24.880]  Matto apparently was dissed by him and again he waxes orgasmic over this does this man have any
[1:43:24.880 --> 1:43:31.920]  idea of what he's talking about and then what happens is you you have this unique and this is
[1:43:31.920 --> 1:43:37.920]  what people should realize for the first time there is an absolute existential threat to the
[1:43:37.920 --> 1:43:46.080]  mainstream alt left anti-trump puppet sock puppet media there's a real existential threat you
[1:43:46.080 --> 1:43:55.600]  do you Alex Sernovic for all these folks name it you are and what happens is they're saying oh my
[1:43:55.600 --> 1:44:04.000]  god what do we do do you know that on your worst day on your worst day your worst video your worst
[1:44:04.000 --> 1:44:13.520]  I mean you you out do I don't know how many conventional brick and mortar hardcore conventional
[1:44:13.520 --> 1:44:18.080]  media do you know what that does to them and now they're turning to their friends and by the way
[1:44:18.080 --> 1:44:22.400]  I got to say something right now because you mentioned this fight Facebook can you please explain
[1:44:22.400 --> 1:44:30.000]  to me and I'm a lawyer by profession and I want I don't want people to be in any way linked criminally
[1:44:30.000 --> 1:44:36.240]  to somebody who is inspired by some insanity somebody could read your poetry listen to your song
[1:44:36.240 --> 1:44:41.680]  and go out and kill 12 and I don't think you should be held responsible but Facebook knows
[1:44:41.680 --> 1:44:48.640]  everything Paul about you good morning Paul it's 35 degrees in your town good morning Paul Paul can
[1:44:48.640 --> 1:44:53.120]  we have your phone number Paul can we have your email Paul would you would you hey this is in your
[1:44:53.120 --> 1:44:57.680]  neighborhood Paul we know where you are we know your friends hey Paul remember saying this a year
[1:44:57.680 --> 1:45:05.280]  ago hey Paul remember this we know where you are but if Paul Joseph Watson decides to get a gun
[1:45:05.280 --> 1:45:12.160]  hold somebody hostage or rape somebody for five days or or beat somebody they don't know where you are
[1:45:12.160 --> 1:45:18.320]  find you I don't know what you're talking about you think maybe maybe I'm crazy maybe I'm mr.
[1:45:18.320 --> 1:45:22.720]  conspiracy theory that they don't want to tell the cops where these people are because then they're
[1:45:22.720 --> 1:45:28.240]  going to realize that they're basically admitting that they know where we are do not find it funny
[1:45:28.240 --> 1:45:35.040]  that if I post something that doesn't that calls into question Obama's birth or whatever
[1:45:35.040 --> 1:45:40.800]  something that does not meet the the arduous you know a fact filters a political fact and
[1:45:40.800 --> 1:45:46.480]  snopes by the way the biggest cons since the next tattoo but do you think that maybe I mean those
[1:45:46.480 --> 1:45:51.680]  are people who say take that down who know everything about me I'm doing Facebook live
[1:45:52.480 --> 1:46:01.840]  they can't find somebody on the run I mean are you kidding me do they expect me to believe that
[1:46:01.840 --> 1:46:07.120]  it I mean it is interesting isn't it the the photos we know are geotagged where they can
[1:46:07.120 --> 1:46:11.440]  locate them but I mean let's get on to that I wanted to cover it of course we had this horrific
[1:46:11.440 --> 1:46:17.840]  video which went up which was uploaded he goes up to this guy this is frail old man shoots him
[1:46:17.840 --> 1:46:23.840]  absolutely senseless horrific murder you can't even pin any kind of narrative to this at least
[1:46:23.840 --> 1:46:28.240]  with ISIS beheading you can pin a narrative from where it came from even though it's completely
[1:46:28.240 --> 1:46:34.160]  horrific in and of itself but with this I mean do you think that you know social media has encouraged
[1:46:34.160 --> 1:46:40.560]  this kind of insanity or is it pre-existing is it going to happen with or without Facebook or do
[1:46:40.560 --> 1:46:47.680]  you think that this kind of instant celebrity as dark as it is is encouraging to do this people
[1:46:47.680 --> 1:46:53.280]  through social media yes the answer is of course yes whenever you do that look there was a time
[1:46:53.280 --> 1:46:58.880]  years ago when you know I'm sure when the Gutenberg press came along I said hey this is great we can
[1:46:58.880 --> 1:47:04.320]  print the Bible well as soon as porno pornographers came along they said no no we got something else
[1:47:04.320 --> 1:47:10.720]  in mind well nobody's gonna you know blast or a blast the printing press we had the anarchist
[1:47:10.720 --> 1:47:15.440]  cookbook in 1970 where people would say you can't print that people are going to be you're going to
[1:47:15.440 --> 1:47:20.560]  encourage people to make bombs you're going to this has been going on forever what it does is
[1:47:20.560 --> 1:47:27.600]  is social media potentiates insanity doesn't cause it it inspires some but here's the best part
[1:47:28.160 --> 1:47:35.440]  if you provide a platform if you you know in the world of libel if you republish something over
[1:47:35.440 --> 1:47:40.480]  and over and over and you're basically responsible for repeating something that people have considered
[1:47:40.480 --> 1:47:45.440]  to be libelous or detrimental or whatever it is you hold a certain degree of responsibility
[1:47:45.440 --> 1:47:52.720]  but what I don't understand is how is it that a that a a group of people facebook in particular
[1:47:52.720 --> 1:47:58.960]  that is so persnickety have you ever had posts that you've wanted to post denied
[1:47:59.760 --> 1:48:05.200]  denied or they say no yeah all the time I mean at one stage they were blocking every
[1:48:05.200 --> 1:48:11.040]  poster spam if it was an info wars link it was incredible so that means that somewhere
[1:48:11.040 --> 1:48:18.320]  somebody said we're going to put into an encryption algorithm your name now do you think somebody
[1:48:18.320 --> 1:48:25.120]  would say hey zuckerberg I got an idea can you maybe put in something that looks for the word kill
[1:48:26.000 --> 1:48:35.280]  or think or listens for gunshots or maybe just maybe is there a is there a main office at facebook
[1:48:35.280 --> 1:48:41.120]  does somebody say hello thank you for calling facebook did you know somebody's killing people
[1:48:41.120 --> 1:48:46.320]  on facebook I'm sorry stand by we'll put you online too because yeah hey boss you said you know
[1:48:46.320 --> 1:48:55.040]  somebody is killing somebody can we track these people down I know that we basically have every
[1:48:55.600 --> 1:49:02.080]  aspect of their life that has been recorded and through cross referencing
[1:49:02.080 --> 1:49:12.240]  I want I cannot believe how in this world of hyper militarization and moabs and you know
[1:49:12.800 --> 1:49:22.160]  predictive software minority report stuff we have paul tv's that can listen to you
[1:49:22.160 --> 1:49:31.600]  but we can't find a person on the run who basically uses facebook nobody could you
[1:49:31.600 --> 1:49:35.840]  think somebody would say I know exactly where he is he's right here oh thank you how does this
[1:49:35.840 --> 1:49:42.400]  happen now does anybody question that and I'm not necessarily saying that it's their responsibility
[1:49:42.400 --> 1:49:48.880]  I'm not saying it's their fault I'm not doing that but what I love is the selectivity of big
[1:49:48.880 --> 1:49:56.240]  brother sometimes he helps sometimes he does it and by the way this this great equalizer let's
[1:49:56.240 --> 1:50:02.720]  look at that fellow mr. dowell the other day on united airlines were it not for citizen journalists
[1:50:02.720 --> 1:50:08.400]  who became the eyes and ears of the collective conscious of the of the country all of this
[1:50:08.400 --> 1:50:14.240]  would have been just swept under the rug so what I'm saying is is that none of this makes any sense
[1:50:14.880 --> 1:50:22.480]  they know exactly where I am they know exactly where you are and I maybe I'm the conspiracy
[1:50:22.480 --> 1:50:27.200]  nut here but do you mean to tell me that there isn't a remoteness of possibilities where somebody
[1:50:27.200 --> 1:50:32.240]  is saying you know if we all of a sudden break the door down maybe that kind of sends the wrong
[1:50:32.240 --> 1:50:38.160]  message I don't know I've never been surprised when it comes to corporate and government merging

[1:55:48.480 --> 1:55:52.080]  on the french election i just want to get your quick take on the french election in the final
[1:55:52.080 --> 1:55:56.640]  couple of minutes here you know one of the things that of course our mainstream media
[1:55:56.640 --> 1:56:03.680]  uh portray marina le pen to be some kind of not she's a nazi and you know of course well of course
[1:56:03.680 --> 1:56:07.920]  i wait whenever i heard that initially i said who i want to hear what she has to say because
[1:56:07.920 --> 1:56:14.240]  remember whatever the media say mainstream media it's the opposite they are the reverse or inverse
[1:56:15.120 --> 1:56:21.520]  search dog you know the bloodhound when the dog goes this way go this way like i like they said
[1:56:21.520 --> 1:56:27.600]  never believe anything unless it's until it's officially denied did you hear what she said
[1:56:27.600 --> 1:56:32.640]  when they asked her questions about what do you have against people wearing burkas or women wearing
[1:56:32.640 --> 1:56:40.720]  burkinis and what do you what's your beef and she would say things like that's not french that's not
[1:56:40.720 --> 1:56:46.880]  the way we are and when i listened to that i said wait a minute now i may be extrapolating a tad
[1:56:46.880 --> 1:56:53.040]  too much maybe we'll be the first time we'll be the last time but this is what trump's message was
[1:56:53.040 --> 1:57:00.400]  and by the way before he wanted to this neocon frenzy i guess before i guess they got to him
[1:57:00.400 --> 1:57:05.680]  when he was going to make america great and believed in infrastructure and jobs and what
[1:57:05.680 --> 1:57:11.120]  really mattered what got him elected but that's another issue but what she was saying was that
[1:57:11.120 --> 1:57:18.480]  there was this core valued principle of what we are this is who we are the french when you
[1:57:18.480 --> 1:57:25.440]  agree on it doesn't matter now do you know what they call that nationalism or my favorite populism
[1:57:25.440 --> 1:57:31.200]  or if you really want to be crazy nativism i want people to watch this because that's not
[1:57:31.200 --> 1:57:37.520]  about france it's not about their particular idiosyncratic geography this is about world themes
[1:57:37.520 --> 1:57:44.640]  world memes and world tropes that you will see here now and in the immediate future absolutely
[1:57:44.640 --> 1:57:51.360]  incredible we have an article which we posted 500 000 ballots have been sent out to people who live
[1:57:51.360 --> 1:57:58.480]  outside of france with two votes they've got two polling cards that obviously means that people who
[1:57:58.480 --> 1:58:02.720]  are naturally going to be against le pen they're going to have the opportunity to vote twice the
[1:58:02.720 --> 1:58:07.120]  police are saying they're not even going to investigate it incredible lionel quickly 20

[2:00:34.240 --> 2:00:40.160]  david night coming up with the fourth hour next segment mike cernovich to break down that massive
[2:00:40.160 --> 2:00:47.280]  bombshell story about google delisting relegating info wars.com articles he's going to break that
[2:00:47.280 --> 2:00:52.720]  down here in the next segment first i want to cover this which is what we briefly touched on in the
[2:00:52.720 --> 2:00:58.240]  last segment this is out of the express how marine le penne is facing wipeout in french election
[2:00:58.240 --> 2:01:04.320]  after computer blunder just to blunder nothing to worry about they're not even going to investigate
[2:01:04.320 --> 2:01:09.920]  it until after the election a monumental computer blunder could cost marine le penne the french
[2:01:09.920 --> 2:01:17.120]  election has 500 000 citizens living outside of france have the chance to vote twice nobody
[2:01:17.120 --> 2:01:22.640]  cares they're not even going to investigate half a million people receive duplicate polling cards in
[2:01:22.640 --> 2:01:27.360]  the post which would allow them to cast two votes at the first round of the french election held on
[2:01:27.360 --> 2:01:33.200]  april 23rd french authorities confirmed they would not be investigating they're not going to
[2:01:33.200 --> 2:01:39.200]  investigate it even though it's potential electoral fraud after until after the election
[2:01:39.200 --> 2:01:45.680]  when retrospective prosecution may take place this could crush marine le penne's dreams of
[2:01:45.680 --> 2:01:51.520]  surging to power now bear in mind the polls currently show marine le penne 20 percent
[2:01:51.520 --> 2:01:56.240]  immanuel macron the fake populist who was hatched out of the establishment literally
[2:01:56.240 --> 2:02:02.320]  in a political lab they tried to sell him as a fake populist it failed he's plummeting
[2:02:02.320 --> 2:02:07.520]  you have this far left communist candidate melen sean who they're calling the french
[2:02:07.520 --> 2:02:12.080]  hugo chavez because venezuela is such a great example everything's going hunky dory there isn't
[2:02:12.080 --> 2:02:18.880]  it but he's shot up to 20 percent it's all over the place of course the only person who's actually
[2:02:18.880 --> 2:02:25.760]  put forward any policies that will address the dire situation in france when it comes to islamism
[2:02:25.760 --> 2:02:33.120]  terror attacks and the march of sharia law that's marine le penne but now she's being sabotaged
[2:02:33.120 --> 2:02:40.960]  500 000 citizens living outside of france again more likely to vote for an establishment pro-eu
[2:02:40.960 --> 2:02:47.760]  candidate not likely to vote for marine le penne they're going to get two votes and nobody cares
[2:02:48.320 --> 2:02:54.000]  not even going to investigate it until after the election these people some of them will use both
[2:02:54.000 --> 2:03:00.240]  what votes don't deny it i mean don't hide behind their their supposed moral high ground some of
[2:03:00.240 --> 2:03:07.200]  them will do that and that's electoral fraud and it should be investigated absolutely insane story
[2:03:07.200 --> 2:03:13.760]  we have sky news reporting unprecedented migrant situation in the Mediterranean a charity that
[2:03:13.760 --> 2:03:19.120]  rescues migrants has described the situation this weekend as unprecedented after going to the aid of
[2:03:19.120 --> 2:03:26.000]  people aboard nine boats in the Mediterranean sea they rescued 1500 to 1800 men women and children
[2:03:26.000 --> 2:03:31.920]  of course not normally very many women and children as you can see in that photo right there
[2:03:31.920 --> 2:03:37.840]  and this is what's going on with the migrant crisis it's it's not even a refugee crisis
[2:03:37.840 --> 2:03:44.880]  okay the vast majority of citizens are not syrian they're not even syrian refugees that's a small
[2:03:44.880 --> 2:03:50.480]  percentage what's happening out of libya they send out boats it's not as if these people
[2:03:50.480 --> 2:03:55.920]  are struggling to get all the way from libya into europe if they can get on a boat if they can get
[2:03:55.920 --> 2:04:04.560]  11 miles away from libyan shores the EU and these NGO groups literally send out boats as a taxi
[2:04:04.560 --> 2:04:12.160]  service to pick up these migrants 11 miles offshore from libya and most of them don't even come from
[2:04:12.160 --> 2:04:19.920]  libya they're coming from other west african countries the NGOs the EU is conspiring with
[2:04:19.920 --> 2:04:25.760]  people smugglers they literally call them up and say we've got a boatload of people come and pick
[2:04:25.760 --> 2:04:33.520]  them up that's not a migrant crisis that's using migrants as a weapon to destabilize the west
[2:04:33.520 --> 2:04:39.280]  and nobody knows about it they're not being told that story it at this point it's a taxi service
[2:04:39.280 --> 2:04:45.520]  we've seen the massive social problems that it's causing in europe and that's being exacerbated
[2:04:45.520 --> 2:04:52.240]  by the EU by these NGOs we'll be back with Mike Cernovich breaking huge news about google censorship
[2:04:52.240 --> 2:04:57.120]  right after this info wars dot com
[2:04:58.880 --> 2:05:04.400]  want to stop progress contact your local progressive democrat with air bnb rising in popularity the
[2:05:04.400 --> 2:05:08.880]  hotel industry is freaking out and progressive democrats are responding first the federal
[2:05:08.880 --> 2:05:13.280]  trade commission requested an investigation be done into how air bnb was affecting the housing
[2:05:13.280 --> 2:05:18.720]  market why waste our money on that i'm not sure but governor of new york andrew qualmo signed a bill
[2:05:18.720 --> 2:05:23.120]  making it a final offense to post on air bnb another example of the government getting
[2:05:23.120 --> 2:05:27.440]  involved in private business where it doesn't belong if you violate a lease that is between
[2:05:27.440 --> 2:05:32.160]  you and your leaseholder but now the government has a preemptive strike against the air bnb host
[2:05:32.160 --> 2:05:37.280]  you can be sure this is a result of the hotel industry lobbying our fine politicians linda
[2:05:37.280 --> 2:05:42.080]  rosenthal a manhattan democrat who sponsored the bill said this sets a standard for those
[2:05:42.080 --> 2:05:46.960]  struggling with the impact of air bnb on affordable housing which doesn't even make sense because
[2:05:46.960 --> 2:05:51.680]  innovation and competition always lowers cost but these are democrats we're talking about here
[2:05:51.680 --> 2:05:56.160]  so don't bother trying to progress an industry progressive democrats are waiting to stop you

[2:09:04.800 --> 2:09:09.920]  exactly self-deprecating right so i had to do a mind i had to stage a mindset intervention on him

[2:09:46.880 --> 2:09:52.160]  meetup yesterday a lot of people those of you listening in austin you are not alone the fake news
[2:09:52.160 --> 2:09:57.280]  media wants you to believe that you're isolated and even in a liberal enclave like austin texas
[2:09:57.280 --> 2:10:02.320]  we had i just had an informal happy hour i didn't even announce the event in advance i didn't even
[2:10:02.320 --> 2:10:05.920]  tell people where it was going to be until like two hours before just a single tweet right yeah
[2:10:05.920 --> 2:10:11.840]  like 75 people yeah yeah off and on 75 to 100 actually people just kept kept pouring in that
[2:10:11.840 --> 2:10:18.160]  was incredible so don't listen to the fake news media there are us everywhere we are everywhere
[2:10:18.720 --> 2:10:23.600]  now let's get into the big story mike obviously it broke late last night uh you put it up on medium
[2:10:23.600 --> 2:10:28.800]  it was on your twitter we've got it up on info wars dot com right now google this is a massive story
[2:10:28.800 --> 2:10:33.440]  we've seen them manipulate elections they had studies where they could manipulate simply by
[2:10:33.440 --> 2:10:39.840]  altering their algorithm up to 80 million undecided voters they're doing it again in france they're
[2:10:39.840 --> 2:10:46.720]  educating the french people on trust on fake news now we have evidence of them directly
[2:10:47.280 --> 2:10:52.960]  targeting info wars dot com break it down for us right so we'll start from the beginning is a lot
[2:10:52.960 --> 2:10:57.440]  of people what you want to learn about a new subject what you do is you type in you know
[2:10:57.440 --> 2:11:02.160]  whatever the subject is paul joseph watson boom you go into google what turns up in google
[2:11:02.880 --> 2:11:08.640]  is based on an algorithm that google wants to keep pure because that way they can go to
[2:11:08.640 --> 2:11:13.120]  advertisers and other people and say we don't manipulate search results manually in fact when
[2:11:13.760 --> 2:11:18.160]  there was a story that it broke several months before the election that google had been caught
[2:11:18.160 --> 2:11:22.080]  manipulating this algorithm and they freaked out because this big business billions of dollars
[2:11:22.080 --> 2:11:26.160]  at stake they want people to believe that they don't manipulate their algorithm so what did they do
[2:11:26.960 --> 2:11:32.880]  i got this tip from a very reliable source who works for search engine integrity these are the
[2:11:32.880 --> 2:11:37.520]  people who go through and they manually rate every article so if they rate the article high
[2:11:38.240 --> 2:11:42.880]  then the article is going to show up on page one of google because remember the war on google is
[2:11:42.880 --> 2:11:47.520]  you want to be on page one google you want to be the number one result on google for whatever it is
[2:11:47.520 --> 2:11:53.520]  so what they're doing now is they want to manually if they've been instructed to everybody who does
[2:11:53.520 --> 2:11:59.840]  this has been instructed to rate every article from info wars dot com no matter how true it is
[2:11:59.840 --> 2:12:04.720]  no matter how confirmed it is to rate it as a low quality article what this will do is
[2:12:05.440 --> 2:12:08.720]  prevent info wars from being on the first page of google for any search result
[2:12:09.520 --> 2:12:13.280]  and when it you know when it happened with facebook's trending list it was a huge scandal
[2:12:13.280 --> 2:12:18.240]  they had to apologize they have to have big meetings with glenbeck of all people but several
[2:12:18.240 --> 2:12:24.240]  conservative commentators they had to promise that they would change it that it wouldn't be partisan
[2:12:24.240 --> 2:12:29.760]  that it wouldn't be manipulated now it's happening with google but mike google's a private company
[2:12:29.760 --> 2:12:33.120]  they can do whatever they want right yeah they're a private company they can do whatever they want
[2:12:33.120 --> 2:12:37.760]  okay great sure i'm a private person i can do whatever i want i can complain about i can criticize
[2:12:37.760 --> 2:12:42.880]  it we can use the power of the free market this is what cracks me up where all these really weak
[2:12:42.880 --> 2:12:47.360]  minded they go google's a private company they can do whatever they want okay then why are you
[2:12:47.360 --> 2:12:53.600]  complaining about me criticizing google right so why do you criticize me for criticizing a massive
[2:12:53.600 --> 2:12:58.880]  globalist multi-billion dollar corporation and moreover this this idea that their private company
[2:12:58.880 --> 2:13:05.280]  is belied by a couple points one eric schmidt conspired with hillary clinton's campaign hillary
[2:13:05.280 --> 2:13:09.440]  clinton obviously was trying to be president she was secretary of state eric schmidt had conspired
[2:13:09.440 --> 2:13:15.440]  with barack obama so there is a conspiracy with google and with the government so if you're doing
[2:13:15.440 --> 2:13:22.000]  that you now can't say you're a private corporation you're a quasi governmental entity one two is that
[2:13:22.640 --> 2:13:30.640]  they keep going to congress asking for things asking for favors this idea that they're just
[2:13:30.640 --> 2:13:36.240]  some private company mom and pop shop right it cracks me up oh my god they're just a private mom
[2:13:36.240 --> 2:13:41.520]  and pop shop you know you can't criticize them these people hire lobbyists they spend millions
[2:13:41.520 --> 2:13:46.000]  of dollars lobbying the government it's not just some private company that's such a joke of an
[2:13:46.000 --> 2:13:50.880]  argument and remember remember the scandal where you would type in hillary clinton is to the different
[2:13:50.880 --> 2:13:56.800]  search engines before the election bing yahoo you know hillary clinton is the auto suggestion
[2:13:56.800 --> 2:14:02.240]  would pop up a criminal right google you didn't get that you got the same on every other single
[2:14:02.240 --> 2:14:06.400]  search engine because they were fair they were neutral they were just putting out what was put
[2:14:06.400 --> 2:14:12.720]  in what was being inputted with hillary it was all censored it was all sanitized hillary's good
[2:14:12.720 --> 2:14:18.080]  hillary's moral right exactly and that led to a big outcry and then google said we would never
[2:14:18.080 --> 2:14:22.640]  manipulate we would never manipulate our search results manually even though they were caught
[2:14:22.640 --> 2:14:27.360]  doing it right vaguely and now they're caught doing it again that that email was a mass email
[2:14:27.360 --> 2:14:31.040]  the source told me because i at first said well hey can i post this are you going to get you know
[2:14:31.040 --> 2:14:36.480]  docs are blown up and he goes no no no it went out to hundreds and hundreds and if not thousands
[2:14:36.480 --> 2:14:41.280]  of people so that it was a mass email so if anybody in the fake news wants to actually fact
[2:14:41.280 --> 2:14:46.240]  check it just like i was right about susan rice just like i was right about mcmaster just like pjw
[2:14:46.240 --> 2:14:51.120]  paula great excuse me and i would write about hillary's health you'll find out that this email
[2:14:51.120 --> 2:14:56.480]  went out to all of google's contractors there you can find the email so if you wanted to some real
[2:14:56.480 --> 2:15:01.440]  journalism rather than just write articles about paula great's tweets my tweets how about instead
[2:15:01.440 --> 2:15:05.040]  of writing about our tweets and acting like oh my god they tweeted something today let's turn
[2:15:05.040 --> 2:15:11.280]  into an article how about you actually do some real journalism and hold these big massive multi
[2:15:11.280 --> 2:15:17.520]  billion dollar corporations accountable speak truth to power and the other issue mic is on the
[2:15:17.520 --> 2:15:22.720]  private company argument it's not this it's a monopoly i mean come on google is basically the
[2:15:22.720 --> 2:15:28.160]  internet at this point if you manipulate that it's you know it's the equivalent it is a telecommunications
[2:15:28.160 --> 2:15:32.800]  company at this point it's a service it's a public utility almost it would be like cutting
[2:15:32.800 --> 2:15:38.080]  someone's electricity off if they had the wrong opinions at this point it's got to that level
[2:15:38.080 --> 2:15:44.400]  the social media companies google included have said they want to be treated as public utilities
[2:15:44.400 --> 2:15:50.720]  but then when they actually behave in a way that is uh manipulative partisan and they get called
[2:15:50.720 --> 2:15:55.360]  out on it then they're just a private company again you can't have it both way right right exactly so
[2:15:55.360 --> 2:16:01.120]  what what paula great is talking about is how your your cell phone company can't say oh i don't
[2:16:01.120 --> 2:16:05.600]  like how cernivich uses twitter i don't like that he's so effective and he's world famous and is
[2:16:05.600 --> 2:16:11.440]  really taking on the establishment i'm just going to deny himself on service as a utility
[2:16:11.440 --> 2:16:16.960]  you have to let people use your internet because they're all using infrastructure that was created
[2:16:16.960 --> 2:16:21.600]  in the public interest they're all using that kind of infrastructure okay so google twitter and all
[2:16:21.600 --> 2:16:26.240]  those companies go so that's what i mean by a public utility the water company here can't say
[2:16:26.240 --> 2:16:31.360]  well we don't like info wars they're too effective at taking on the globalist we're just not going
[2:16:31.360 --> 2:16:36.320]  to provide water to the company you can't do that your utility everybody has to have equal access to
[2:16:36.320 --> 2:16:41.440]  it so google and twitter and other social media companies that said well yeah we're like a public
[2:16:41.440 --> 2:16:48.480]  utility we are like a water company because there's great power in being treated like utility if you're
[2:16:48.480 --> 2:16:53.200]  a corporation and you're treated like a utility the government won't regulate you under antitrust
[2:16:53.200 --> 2:16:58.400]  law there's all these little perks that you get well the flip side to that is you cannot manipulate
[2:16:58.400 --> 2:17:03.360]  your coverage or manipulate your utility to go after people you disagree with or go after political
[2:17:03.360 --> 2:17:07.840]  adversaries you have to treat everybody equally under the same rules and if you go back to the
[2:17:07.840 --> 2:17:12.800]  article you just had up on screen this was a few weeks ago in fact it was last month i believe
[2:17:12.800 --> 2:17:18.720]  they were caught delisting and relegating relegating content it was basically a quite a
[2:17:18.720 --> 2:17:24.240]  prominent commentator who had put up a website about the religion of peace islam she quoted
[2:17:24.240 --> 2:17:29.760]  passages out of the quran made the point that these aren't peaceful passages killing all the
[2:17:29.760 --> 2:17:37.440]  infidels etc and they use that as the example upsetting offensive to tell the truth about
[2:17:37.440 --> 2:17:43.440]  this belief system that is relegated on google that is not going to be on the first page whereas it
[2:17:43.440 --> 2:17:48.560]  was before that's what they're doing with info wars might they directly mention info wars this
[2:17:48.560 --> 2:17:54.240]  isn't just a general vague or we're clamping down on fake news or whatever info wars is the example
[2:17:54.240 --> 2:17:58.000]  mentioned in the document right no no hundred percent that is why immediately when i got it i
[2:17:58.000 --> 2:18:02.400]  said i have to break this story last night even though i had a big dinner with friends and you
[2:18:02.400 --> 2:18:07.040]  know i'd hung out i had this huge meetup met all these people the day before you know somebody
[2:18:07.040 --> 2:18:12.640]  tried to sucker punch me i had to hit them it's been a busy week for me but on sunday night because
[2:18:12.640 --> 2:18:18.400]  i view this is not only an attack on info wars it is an attack on everybody listening and watching
[2:18:18.400 --> 2:18:24.480]  if they take down they take down info wars we're all done none of us are safe this is this is not
[2:18:24.480 --> 2:18:29.600]  this is the way i read it i didn't say this is an attack on info wars i go this is an attack on me
[2:18:29.600 --> 2:18:35.520]  because info wars is on the vanguard and if they can take down info wars they can take down everybody
[2:18:35.520 --> 2:18:40.320]  nobody have free speech nobody listening here i'll have free speech now what's the solution
[2:18:40.320 --> 2:18:45.200]  might you were talking last night about flash mobs about getting people physically out in front of
[2:18:45.200 --> 2:18:51.360]  google headquarters and speaking truth to power so as you can see i'm fired up i was talking to
[2:18:51.360 --> 2:18:54.240]  some people you know i'm not going to tell you who i was talking to because i don't know if they've
[2:18:54.240 --> 2:19:00.640]  mentioned what had happened the meeting we had but look goes like this we need to get 500 people
[2:19:00.640 --> 2:19:06.320]  1,000 people up to google's headquarters and have a freedom rally we need to get paul the greats people
[2:19:06.320 --> 2:19:12.480]  my people all the info wars everybody listening here we need to have a big big big peaceful
[2:19:12.480 --> 2:19:19.840]  friendly party in front of google headquarters to support pre-speech to support the right of
[2:19:19.840 --> 2:19:24.880]  everybody to have equal treatment under these utility rules because again they said they wanted
[2:19:24.880 --> 2:19:30.480]  to be treated like utility so now we're going to hold them to their word i imagine i imagine this
[2:19:30.480 --> 2:19:36.000]  oh we're going out we got 30 seconds i imagine a big party we need to plan it i want 500 people i
[2:19:36.000 --> 2:19:42.240]  want 1,000 people microphones i want everybody there have a good time peacefully in front of google

[2:25:47.840 --> 2:25:52.880]  the whole thing is if by your toothpaste you you got to realize it is a direct attack they've
[2:25:52.880 --> 2:25:58.320]  cut off the google adsense they're losing five from five million dollars i took a tour of this place
[2:25:58.320 --> 2:26:02.480]  i couldn't believe how big it is they're expanding the operations i'm not being paid for be here to
[2:26:02.480 --> 2:26:06.640]  say this but i believe that you have to support people who are supporting you so even people who
[2:26:06.640 --> 2:26:10.400]  don't want to take the supplements or maybe they don't want to take that for whatever reason
[2:26:10.400 --> 2:26:15.520]  everybody needs toothpaste get the toothpaste every little thing that people do nothing you do is too

[2:26:29.600 --> 2:26:34.000]  millions of people in america the freedom fighters all unite and even if they only do one quote
[2:26:34.000 --> 2:26:40.560]  unquote little thing you have a massive massive tsunami of support my we got this breaking article
[2:26:40.560 --> 2:26:45.760]  at info wars dot com google robo tool flags conservative comments as toxic so it's not
[2:26:45.760 --> 2:26:51.920]  just the content of the article now it's the comments as well major mainstream news websites
[2:26:51.920 --> 2:26:56.800]  have removed their comments and sections all together that's been happening for years now
[2:26:56.800 --> 2:27:02.560]  and it's because and they've done studies on this the comments have more impact have more
[2:27:02.560 --> 2:27:08.800]  influence on how the reader judges the content than the content of the article itself that's why
[2:27:08.800 --> 2:27:14.480]  they've declared war on comment sections because again they're losing the debate so now the google
[2:27:14.480 --> 2:27:20.240]  ai tool used to flag offensive comments as a seemingly built-in bias against conservative
[2:27:20.240 --> 2:27:26.800]  and libertarian viewpoints so if you put in global warming is fake it's 39 percent toxic compared to
[2:27:26.800 --> 2:27:34.080]  only two percent toxic for global warming is real that's how they decide which one gets censored so
[2:27:34.080 --> 2:27:39.440]  they're now targeting the comments as well yeah exactly and that is why when i said earlier
[2:27:39.440 --> 2:27:46.080]  the segment this is not an attack on alex jones this is an attack on everybody you can't even
[2:27:46.080 --> 2:27:50.000]  leave comments somebody i can't remember who said this you can tell me maybe who said it is they go
[2:27:50.560 --> 2:27:56.960]  the election was the war against the commoners in the comment section versus the article itself
[2:27:56.960 --> 2:28:00.880]  i can't remember who said that but that was such an astute observation which is that the people
[2:28:00.880 --> 2:28:05.920]  would speak out in populism populism is the new punk rock is the new counterculture the people
[2:28:05.920 --> 2:28:10.720]  speaking out against this globalist elite who are all in the payroll they're all told what to say
[2:28:10.720 --> 2:28:14.400]  i mean i can that's why you know you know i don't even read all the articles about me and i don't
[2:28:14.400 --> 2:28:18.720]  read any articles about the paul a great either because they're all the same thing because they
[2:28:18.720 --> 2:28:23.840]  all take their talking points from their same owners they're all owned by the same corporations
[2:28:23.840 --> 2:28:29.680]  six corporations own 90 percent of all media you can all look up media ownership and concentration
[2:28:29.680 --> 2:28:35.040]  so what happened is people would read an article and it was a psychological war for your mind because
[2:28:35.040 --> 2:28:39.840]  people read an article and the article basically says everybody who supports trump
[2:28:39.840 --> 2:28:44.960]  is a neo-nazi who hates women and probably you know commits domestic violence and people read
[2:28:44.960 --> 2:28:50.160]  that and they go i don't believe that if you go to the comment section you have people pushing back
[2:28:50.160 --> 2:28:55.280]  and now you feel connected there's a human connection component to it so the the fake news
[2:28:55.280 --> 2:29:00.640]  people said oh man we better close the comments we want people to feel isolated and alone that is why
[2:29:00.640 --> 2:29:06.960]  community is so important and that is why we have to organize a big major event at google headquarters
[2:29:06.960 --> 2:29:11.600]  i'm thinking you know if we have to bust people in you know we just need to get everybody who
[2:29:11.600 --> 2:29:16.480]  wants to speak for freedom and to stand up against this censoring the comments against censoring
[2:29:16.480 --> 2:29:22.640]  the search results microphones podiums you know the a-list speakers we need that we need the people
[2:29:22.640 --> 2:29:27.280]  to show up in massive numbers and push back and it's always one thing or the other it's either
[2:29:27.280 --> 2:29:31.440]  no comments because nobody's reading the article or they're getting absolutely
[2:29:31.440 --> 2:29:37.440]  eviscerated in the comments which is why those big mainstream news outlets have removed the section
[2:29:37.440 --> 2:29:43.280]  altogether because that is having a huge influence now they're censoring it because of offensive
[2:29:43.280 --> 2:29:50.240]  comments made by conservatives we'll be back stay right there we're on the march the empires on the
[2:29:50.240 --> 2:30:02.720]  run alex jones and the gcn radio network you have no money this is okay we will take your blood if
[2:30:02.720 --> 2:30:09.040]  you want access to the vatican museums cash visa mastercard or needle is accepted that's right you
[2:30:09.040 --> 2:30:14.560]  can give blood to access the vatican museum the blood payment plan has a slogan give blood and
[2:30:14.560 --> 2:30:19.440]  follow your artistic inclination blood donors then receive a voucher which gives them access to the
[2:30:19.440 --> 2:30:25.600]  museums the director of the vatican museum said without blood there is no life without art life
[2:30:25.600 --> 2:30:32.960]  would be empty and sad okay i love jesus too happy easter i guess this is a good idea get some blood
[2:30:32.960 --> 2:30:38.480]  donations and allow people access to history sounds harmless but wait each blood donation is good for
[2:30:38.480 --> 2:30:45.120]  a four euro voucher it costs 16 euros to access the museums so you have to donate blood four times
[2:30:45.120 --> 2:30:51.120]  before you can even get in by the time you've given enough blood you'd have fainted enjoy michael

[2:33:45.360 --> 2:33:50.800]  in almost every occasion over the past few weeks or so get plagiarized by the mainstream media three
[2:33:50.800 --> 2:33:55.280]  days later and they give you zero credit but you're discredited your fake news even though
[2:33:55.280 --> 2:34:00.000]  they just copy the exact same story and claim credit for it the website is medium dot com slash
[2:34:00.000 --> 2:34:05.200]  at cernovich mike i want to talk about a tweet i mean you put this story out before but there
[2:34:05.200 --> 2:34:11.200]  was a tweet this morning by jack posibick who's been on the show he tweeted today about a seven
[2:34:11.200 --> 2:34:17.520]  figure contract for neocons to conduct crafted hit jobs on prominent trump supporters we saw
[2:34:17.520 --> 2:34:23.760]  it already with milo back a couple of months ago this is the reagan battalion this is basically
[2:34:23.760 --> 2:34:29.280]  you know they succeeded to some extent in enforcing milo to back away a couple of months ago
[2:34:29.280 --> 2:34:33.760]  basically cowards who hide behind a twitter account they don't even show their face we
[2:34:33.760 --> 2:34:38.880]  don't even verify it how's it verified exactly they tweeted saturday this is what they tweeted
[2:34:38.880 --> 2:34:46.000]  quote we have been paid but told to work on big fish only so they admit they're being paid
[2:34:46.000 --> 2:34:52.720]  to do hit pieces on prominent trump supporting commentators my question is mike paid by who
[2:34:53.520 --> 2:34:58.800]  yes i explained to people they're they're being paid by the saudi arabians because
[2:34:58.800 --> 2:35:05.600]  the saudi's use this all goes back to macmaster and patreus patreus has taken over control of the
[2:35:05.600 --> 2:35:12.800]  national security council and has been working to squeeze out bannon and to hype up mcgeneral
[2:35:12.800 --> 2:35:17.520]  mcmaster former john mcmaster because mcmaster wants a massive ground war in syria which by
[2:35:17.520 --> 2:35:21.600]  the way is the story i broke people call it fake and then bloomberg confirmed it and then suddenly
[2:35:21.600 --> 2:35:28.320]  there's another big scoop or whatever so right now what is going on if you are people i can tell
[2:35:28.320 --> 2:35:33.280]  you right now if you tweet at me anything nice there's going to be an army of shills and i actually
[2:35:33.280 --> 2:35:38.720]  i broke this story actually on alex jones about how all this money a seven figure contract went out
[2:35:38.720 --> 2:35:44.160]  so what they're doing is they're attacking and singling out people one by one in attempt to
[2:35:44.160 --> 2:35:49.840]  discredit and divide the movement and some people i'm not going to mention his name um on camera
[2:35:49.840 --> 2:35:53.920]  because i don't want to give him more publicity because he's an effective and a loser but he's
[2:35:53.920 --> 2:36:01.440]  also taking a neocon money and that is why you see a lot of infighting people like paul great people
[2:36:01.440 --> 2:36:07.040]  like me we are we've been around for years right we didn't just surface because of the trump thing
[2:36:07.040 --> 2:36:12.320]  we have been around for years fighting for freedom fighting for free speech and then some people kind
[2:36:12.320 --> 2:36:17.680]  of got into it just because they could use trump to build their brand and now money is going out to
[2:36:17.680 --> 2:36:23.120]  those people so there is a massive uh public relations contract going out they wanted to
[2:36:23.120 --> 2:36:27.840]  credit everybody who opposes a massive ground war in the middle east because there is so much
[2:36:27.840 --> 2:36:33.440]  money to be made in war so much money to be made in fake news that people like us and their view
[2:36:33.440 --> 2:36:38.800]  are it's worth spending a million dollars to try to silence us i know people might that just up and
[2:36:38.800 --> 2:36:44.080]  coming people who have vice writers approach them for interviews they agree to the interview
[2:36:44.080 --> 2:36:49.280]  then they trawl back through their personal facebook pages years and years and in this
[2:36:49.280 --> 2:36:55.840]  example it was a young guy who works for the rebel he's only what 22 23 years old they trawled back
[2:36:55.840 --> 2:37:04.080]  to 2011 2012 found him like in drunk photos on facebook when he was a teenager having fun
[2:37:04.080 --> 2:37:11.040]  asked him pointed questions found his parents name dug into his parents background it was creepy
[2:37:11.040 --> 2:37:16.480]  stalker like behavior there seems to be this intense focus on not just up and coming people
[2:37:16.480 --> 2:37:21.840]  prominent people to try and personally attack them bring them down this seems like part of
[2:37:21.840 --> 2:37:26.800]  the full frontal war that we're being subjected to right now yeah it's totally creepy i i've
[2:37:26.800 --> 2:37:30.800]  had it done to me for a year so to me it's just another day at the office people digging up stuff
[2:37:30.800 --> 2:37:36.000]  photoshopping stuff making up stuff that you never even said taking things that were satirical and
[2:37:36.000 --> 2:37:40.560]  acting like that was actually meant literally so i'm used to it every day and i think it's fun
[2:37:40.560 --> 2:37:45.280]  i think it's fun but if you're a 22 year old and you're not really set financially that's
[2:37:45.280 --> 2:37:49.920]  going to intimidate and scare off a lot of people because everybody has said something
[2:37:49.920 --> 2:37:54.000]  that they didn't mean maybe they had a little alcohol maybe they weren't clear with their thoughts
[2:37:54.560 --> 2:37:58.640]  so what they're doing is they're sending a message that anybody who's a freedom fighter
[2:37:58.640 --> 2:38:02.480]  anybody who's standing up for what's right anybody who's standing up for americana
[2:38:02.480 --> 2:38:10.960]  and americans and real americans are going to have all of their worst moments broadcast to the world
[2:38:10.960 --> 2:38:16.080]  and they're going to treat your worst moment as if that is who they are as a person it's
[2:38:16.080 --> 2:38:20.400]  quite disgusting and they always have to throw back years i mean they did it with tomy loren right
[2:38:20.400 --> 2:38:25.760]  and it's yeah these young kids are like 23 24 of course they're going to have slightly embarrassing
[2:38:25.760 --> 2:38:32.160]  tweets from five years ago yeah it's not long since they were that age they were 18 19 yeah i mean
[2:38:32.160 --> 2:38:37.600]  tomy loren they're like oh she was dancing on a table like okay so five years ago yeah okay yeah
[2:38:37.600 --> 2:38:41.760]  big deal she was in college you know maybe there's a little bit of basic stuff nobody really cares
[2:38:41.760 --> 2:38:46.880]  and that's what they do and then they also what they'll do is they'll take satirical stuff and
[2:38:46.880 --> 2:38:51.280]  then they'll treat it as literally true that that's like another like textual game so if you go so
[2:38:51.280 --> 2:38:55.920]  one time i said like oh kim trail's a real kind of thing and they'll say oh is that what are you
[2:38:55.920 --> 2:39:00.640]  really saying here it's like come on guys they're just memes people talk about memes all the time
[2:39:00.640 --> 2:39:05.840]  but but they they'll just say even if you're trying to just be just use memes they'll try to use that
[2:39:05.840 --> 2:39:12.320]  against you but again for me it's fun i i get a rush out of it because i enjoy conflict i enjoy
[2:39:12.320 --> 2:39:16.960]  when they're attacking me it just reminds me that i'm winning and they're losing paul the greats doing
[2:39:16.960 --> 2:39:22.400]  like 250 million views every month i'm doing like 150 i mean if you think about it these people who
[2:39:22.400 --> 2:39:28.720]  hate on us they can't get a retweet they can't get they can't get a life they have their audience
[2:39:28.720 --> 2:39:34.000]  i mean i've done a running thing every time i visit austin i go out and meet anthony gucciati
[2:39:34.000 --> 2:39:39.520]  we take a picture as if we're a couple on a date yes a running joke the next day there's already
[2:39:39.520 --> 2:39:44.960]  a youtube video with 10 000 these secret gay relationship right it's just hilarious yeah
[2:39:44.960 --> 2:39:49.520]  they debate these people so easily as yeah well they did that when you were in i think budapest
[2:39:49.520 --> 2:39:54.560]  and you go we're checking out the game and then suddenly you know there's a whole article so yeah
[2:39:54.560 --> 2:40:00.080]  he's he's really gay so first of all like who who cares one is like who cares why is this new
[2:40:00.080 --> 2:40:05.840]  newsworthy why is it that everything like he tweets or i tweet why is it somehow a news cycle
[2:40:06.560 --> 2:40:10.720]  but that's how to think of a real story yeah do something like google like the real research is
[2:40:10.720 --> 2:40:17.760]  google is now manipulating its search results to push a narrative that's real a real story and then
[2:40:17.760 --> 2:40:21.280]  um i don't know if we want to talk about how wall street journal plagiarized there's so much news
[2:40:21.280 --> 2:40:26.560]  guys this is the thing about like why it's so fun to be alive and why they're trying to discredit us
[2:40:26.560 --> 2:40:30.080]  we we talked about well the stories we're going to talk about there's so much going on we can't
[2:40:30.080 --> 2:40:35.200]  even cover it all we need more truth tellers to join the fight and that is why they're attacking
[2:40:35.200 --> 2:40:40.640]  you said every day the fake news media is going after you support these people because it's demoralizing
[2:40:40.640 --> 2:40:44.320]  for people who don't do this for a living it's demoralizing for people who don't get off on it
[2:40:44.320 --> 2:40:49.520]  but yeah the wall street journal they plagiarized breitbart they they stole a story that breitbart
[2:40:49.520 --> 2:40:54.320]  had published in november and then they published it their own yesterday they're just really nasty
[2:40:54.320 --> 2:40:58.080]  people these fake news people i consider wall street journal fake news by the way and of
[2:40:58.080 --> 2:41:04.000]  course they they were the ones who went after pewdiepie when he slightly deviated from making
[2:41:04.000 --> 2:41:09.520]  videos about playing video games and you know mindless comedy slightly deviated talk started
[2:41:09.520 --> 2:41:14.880]  talking about trust in mainstream media declining that threat the fact that he's got 55 million
[2:41:14.880 --> 2:41:19.840]  subscribers that led to a full-on onslaught against somebody who was just primarily a
[2:41:19.840 --> 2:41:25.760]  video gamer on youtube that's how afraid they are right and so with when so for those of you who
[2:41:25.760 --> 2:41:31.040]  aren't listening in there's a video game guy he has 55 million subscribers on youtube maybe 58
[2:41:31.040 --> 2:41:36.880]  there's so many you can hardly keep track he's highly popular and he started to talk about freedom
[2:41:36.880 --> 2:41:40.080]  he didn't even he was not even a pro trump guy he just started talking about freedom
[2:41:40.080 --> 2:41:45.600]  he started questioning the media narrative so what they did was dug up videos where he was
[2:41:45.600 --> 2:41:52.960]  making fun of nazis he was making fun of neo nazism and you know lifted his hand up in a mock
[2:41:52.960 --> 2:41:57.680]  gesture and then the wall street journal which just plagiarized bright part because they can't
[2:41:57.680 --> 2:42:03.840]  do real journalism the wall street journal screen capped that and said pewdiepie is actually
[2:42:03.840 --> 2:42:08.960]  a nazi look at him do the nazi salute they completely omit the fact that he was actually
[2:42:08.960 --> 2:42:14.240]  making fun of the neo nazi kind of stuff and that's again what they do is if you do satire
[2:42:14.240 --> 2:42:19.920]  the treat is real but then what they did was even more dirty and it shows you how evil these
[2:42:19.920 --> 2:42:25.840]  massive globalist corporations are so they pewdiepie had a massive deal with youtube
[2:42:25.840 --> 2:42:30.240]  he had a big show coming out with disney he was making big moves he was making big money
[2:42:30.240 --> 2:42:37.440]  as were many people on youtube not only did they falsely accuse him of being a nazi they took those
[2:42:37.440 --> 2:42:43.200]  pictures to youtube they took them to the advertisers and they said how can you advertise
[2:42:43.200 --> 2:42:48.640]  on a nazi channel how can you advertise and that's what started the whole demonetization
[2:42:48.640 --> 2:42:53.200]  trend isn't it exactly snowballed after that what's interesting is that pewdiepie followed
[2:42:53.200 --> 2:42:58.720]  stefan mollin you and yours truly a couple of weeks after that wall street journal hit piece now
[2:42:58.720 --> 2:43:03.440]  isn't that interesting mike that could lead to something good it is and then they went after
[2:43:03.440 --> 2:43:09.360]  john tron show that's selfishly as a man of principle what they did a pewdiepie was wrong
[2:43:09.360 --> 2:43:16.400]  i disavow it that is fake news i'm opposed to it as a man in a fight to save western civilization
[2:43:16.400 --> 2:43:21.280]  looking for people to join the fight looking for people to push back in globalism i say thank you
[2:43:21.280 --> 2:43:28.480]  fake news thank you for showing all of pewdiepie's 55 million viewers and subscribers who know it's
[2:43:28.480 --> 2:43:33.440]  in his heart thank you for falsely accusing him of being a nazi because now they won't trust you
[2:43:33.440 --> 2:43:37.600]  which means they're gonna trust info wars they're gonna trust paul the great they're gonna trust me
[2:43:37.600 --> 2:43:43.040]  please please spread more fake news on pewdiepie spread more fake news on john tron spread fake
[2:43:43.040 --> 2:43:48.720]  news on all of these people with massive fan bases that way their viewers in real time can be red
[2:43:48.720 --> 2:43:55.360]  pilled and learn that you're all fake i beg you more fake news give it to us shifting topics
[2:43:55.360 --> 2:43:59.040]  mike let's talk about what happened at the capital we had the battle of berkeley we'll
[2:43:59.040 --> 2:44:04.000]  get onto that in a second but you were at the capital here in austin for another anti-trump
[2:44:04.000 --> 2:44:08.320]  tent at temper tantrum from the leftist tells what happened yeah i don't know if the people have
[2:44:08.320 --> 2:44:13.040]  the videos or everything that we could load up but i went to the anti-trump rally give us your
[2:44:13.040 --> 2:44:17.840]  tanks for turns it was the most low-energy pathetic you know there was like 500 people
[2:44:17.840 --> 2:44:23.280]  there actually oh boy oh yeah they were talking about a few reasons i don't have disaster so i go
[2:44:23.280 --> 2:44:27.200]  there and i'm doing just the periscope streaming and it's kind of low energy and i'm sitting there
[2:44:27.920 --> 2:44:33.520]  and i keep inching towards the microphone and as i'm sitting there i start doing the chance with
[2:44:33.520 --> 2:44:39.040]  the people they kind of think i'm one of their own and then i thought to myself i said should i
[2:44:39.040 --> 2:44:45.360]  get up on the microphone and say bill clinton is a rapist and then i go well you know what would
[2:44:45.360 --> 2:44:48.880]  they do to me if i were holding an event what would they do to me i go not only would they
[2:44:50.080 --> 2:44:53.520]  not only would they they come and take the microphone but they would be violent
[2:44:53.520 --> 2:44:58.720]  so i said i'm going to wait till this guy gets off the microphone and right as he leaves i'm
[2:44:58.720 --> 2:45:03.680]  going to get up there i'm going to say bill clinton is a rapist so i wait i'm sitting i'm waiting
[2:45:03.680 --> 2:45:08.800]  i'm waiting for the right moment the guy's leading him a chance he says thank you for coming out
[2:45:08.800 --> 2:45:13.280]  right as he moves i stand up i walk i go to the stage and i get the microphone and i say
[2:45:14.320 --> 2:45:18.240]  bill clinton is a rapist he raped we need a broad rick the media covered it up
[2:45:18.240 --> 2:45:23.760]  bill clinton is a rapist the crowd goes in seconds they were around you right they yeah they
[2:45:23.760 --> 2:45:30.320]  they the crowd freaks out boo they're flipping me off the mask came off they these are not
[2:45:30.320 --> 2:45:35.680]  peaceful people these are very mentally unhealthy unstable people they came in the course they cut
[2:45:35.680 --> 2:45:40.080]  the microphone off they rushed the stage they were surrounding me they were pushing me they were
[2:45:40.080 --> 2:45:44.160]  shoving me they were screaming at me they're putting signs in the face actually i can barely
[2:45:44.160 --> 2:45:48.640]  hear on my right ear today because they were just screaming and shoving me and you know it's basically
[2:45:48.640 --> 2:45:54.400]  assault but not a big deal so i'm walking and i said the police say hey man these people are unstable
[2:45:54.400 --> 2:45:58.560]  would you just leave even though you have a right to be here would you just leave because we can't
[2:45:58.560 --> 2:46:02.880]  trust these people not to riot and i said of course you know i'm pro i'm pro ethical law
[2:46:02.880 --> 2:46:08.560]  enforcement i'm pro police blue lives matter so we're walking we're walking down it's me
[2:46:08.560 --> 2:46:13.600]  two police behind me joe biggs is out of my left as i'm walking down i see a guy kind of
[2:46:13.600 --> 2:46:19.040]  starts sprinting towards me so i can't see my my peripheral says this guy gonna try to sucker punch
[2:46:19.040 --> 2:46:23.600]  me is this guy gonna get violent this feral leftist punch in that so yes is he gonna do it
[2:46:24.160 --> 2:46:28.320]  is he gonna do it yeah so here's you know on the screen the people screaming at me
[2:46:28.320 --> 2:46:33.120]  so and then after this i you know i'm being walked away by the police i see a guy come to my left
[2:46:33.120 --> 2:46:39.440]  he comes over he takes a swipe at me doesn't hit me because i moved my head knocks my phone out
[2:46:39.440 --> 2:46:45.840]  so i turn around and i go whoosh and you can hear my fist collide with the face the guy literally
[2:46:45.840 --> 2:46:51.040]  started crying that is why there's no video of me punching him the face because it was self-defense
[2:46:51.040 --> 2:46:55.520]  legally the police laughed because the guy who thought he was gonna be a tough guy thought he
[2:46:55.520 --> 2:47:01.680]  was gonna hit me he actually started crying live it was hilarious and then i looked at the police
[2:47:01.680 --> 2:47:06.400]  and they laughed and they go we saw what happened you're good to go so that really does show you
[2:47:06.400 --> 2:47:12.320]  that if you are at these events these people are there they are in a cult they are in a cult
[2:47:12.320 --> 2:47:17.520]  they are violent they're feral people you should not go to an event you can sit look at the anger
[2:47:17.520 --> 2:47:22.640]  the rage that this that the animosity that they all have towards me the screaming
[2:47:23.680 --> 2:47:28.960]  look at that these are not healthy people imagine if trump people acted like that that would be on
[2:47:28.960 --> 2:47:36.240]  CNN this is what the fake news covers up and this is why the fake news wants to shut down info wars
[2:47:36.240 --> 2:47:41.520]  wants to shut us all down because that there you'll never see that on CNN you'll never watch that
[2:47:41.520 --> 2:47:46.960]  on the fake news that is the left today nothing but anger and toxicity can't debate they don't
[2:47:46.960 --> 2:47:51.200]  have an argument that's why they're trying to shut us down because they can't compete on a level
[2:47:51.200 --> 2:47:57.200]  playing field it's just autistic screeching it's violence it's confrontation they've got absolutely
[2:47:57.200 --> 2:48:02.240]  nothing you know that coincided mike with what happened at berkeley the battle of berkeley
[2:48:02.240 --> 2:48:06.560]  beautiful i think it was quite decisive who won the battle this time break it down what happened
[2:48:06.560 --> 2:48:15.600]  okay so as we know if you want to attend an event with paul the great milo alex jones
[2:48:15.600 --> 2:48:21.120]  stepham all new anybody who you know jim hoft gateway point to anybody who is just off narrative
[2:48:21.840 --> 2:48:26.720]  the left will show up and they will beat you they will beat women they will throw bricks at your
[2:48:26.720 --> 2:48:32.800]  children they will pepper spray women so what happened is people learned that the police will
[2:48:32.800 --> 2:48:39.440]  not protect you they in a liberal city like berkeley they are issued stand down orders the police are
[2:48:39.440 --> 2:48:45.840]  told just let trump supporters get beat up just let the freedom fighters get beat up let the antifa
[2:48:45.840 --> 2:48:51.440]  which is a domestic terrorist organization let antifa the domestic terrorist organization beat
[2:48:51.440 --> 2:48:57.360]  these up beat these people up including women so they wanted to have a free speech rally the people
[2:48:57.360 --> 2:49:01.920]  realized if you want to have a free speech rally you're going to have to bring your own protection
[2:49:01.920 --> 2:49:08.480]  detail your own security detail so in the streets of berkeley antifa got to decide got to see for
[2:49:08.480 --> 2:49:15.520]  themselves who can do it better you want to meet the streets paul the great he's a pacifist more so
[2:49:15.520 --> 2:49:21.120]  than i am i'm a i'm a i i want to fight but you know i just got to make sure you hit me first
[2:49:21.120 --> 2:49:26.640]  kind of thing paul the great does is just total pacifist right we disavow but they say exactly
[2:49:26.640 --> 2:49:30.960]  where exactly to punch somebody because you disagree with them politically exactly while you
[2:49:30.960 --> 2:49:35.280]  reap what you sow if you go back to the article you had a punch screen from heat street before with
[2:49:35.280 --> 2:49:41.040]  the woman being punched she put out on facebook the woman on the left yes she was going to punch
[2:49:41.040 --> 2:49:47.040]  nazi she assaulted this guy again choking him yes we just about any violence but if you watch the
[2:49:47.040 --> 2:49:52.880]  actual video she attacked him first this is what happened to her now she's whining about being
[2:49:52.880 --> 2:49:58.880]  injured she's whining about being doxxed on the internet this is a member of antifa their speciality
[2:49:58.880 --> 2:50:03.840]  is doxxing people they tried to get my address they turned up at my friend's address a mile down the
[2:50:03.840 --> 2:50:09.040]  road so you reap what you sow mike now they're all out there whining about being attacked and doxxed
[2:50:09.040 --> 2:50:13.520]  well they brought it on themselves and they got steamrolled so here's what here's what they didn't
[2:50:13.520 --> 2:50:21.440]  they miscalculated right this is not the national review this is not these weak people like william
[2:50:21.440 --> 2:50:26.400]  f buckley who says oh if they spit on your face just let them spit on your face let them hit you
[2:50:26.400 --> 2:50:31.760]  the antifa domestic terrorist organization which is also a tool of the media the media incites
[2:50:31.760 --> 2:50:36.480]  some the violence they want to find out what's going to happen i disavow political violence
[2:50:36.480 --> 2:50:43.840]  but i can tell you one thing if it gets hot i know what side is going to win and there are more
[2:50:43.840 --> 2:50:50.240]  videos antifa was later chased off it was a decisive clear victory we'll be back with the

[2:55:49.440 --> 2:55:55.600]  info wars store.com mike you've had a lot of attention from the mainstream media over the
[2:55:55.600 --> 2:56:01.840]  past three weeks you have the 60 minute special you've broken huge story after huge story what led up
[2:56:01.840 --> 2:56:09.120]  to that process and what's next for mike synovich man i don't know they're they're trying to take
[2:56:09.120 --> 2:56:13.920]  me down you know every day they're trying to take me down more lies more hip pieces and all that i'm
[2:56:13.920 --> 2:56:18.560]  saying is that we are growing and the truth is getting out there so i don't even know what is
[2:56:18.560 --> 2:56:24.640]  going on anymore because so many people are waking up every time we're out in public you know people
[2:56:24.640 --> 2:56:29.760]  know us people talk to us the freedom fighters are out there so what is next more community and
[2:56:29.760 --> 2:56:33.760]  more meetups i'm having a big event with um gateway pun if they're going to be there that's
[2:56:33.760 --> 2:56:41.360]  april 29th i'll announce the exact details later so bdc april 29th and i want a big march on google
[2:56:41.360 --> 2:56:48.080]  i want everybody there to show up people need community everybody right neil feels isolated
[2:56:48.080 --> 2:56:52.400]  because of the fake news media lying to you all the time but we're out there we need to form our
[2:56:52.400 --> 2:56:58.320]  own real life social network we need to be having monthly meetups monthly happy hours in cities all
[2:56:58.320 --> 2:57:03.520]  across the world and then we're going to we're taking control we're taking our country back
[2:57:03.520 --> 2:57:09.200]  that's what's next and again that is crucial to have those meetups because it's not something
[2:57:09.200 --> 2:57:13.760]  that we've done generally as conservatives is it there's not what we're known for there is this
[2:57:13.760 --> 2:57:18.320]  accusation that people are hiding behind twitter accounts it is key it is crucial to get out there
[2:57:18.320 --> 2:57:23.120]  physically meet people of like mind because you know the left is going to do that you know they're
[2:57:23.120 --> 2:57:28.640]  going to march and say whose streets our streets well now that's beginning to be rolled back we saw
[2:57:28.640 --> 2:57:35.040]  what happened in berkeley we've clearly got the numbers they haven't yeah exactly so i actually
[2:57:35.040 --> 2:57:39.280]  tweeted out whose streets because i'd cover all the protests and that's what the protest has a
[2:57:39.280 --> 2:57:43.200]  left would say whose streets our streets so i tweeted out after the battle of berkeley whose
[2:57:43.200 --> 2:57:47.840]  streets and the left was completely triggered this is disgusting i can't believe it wait because
[2:57:47.840 --> 2:57:53.680]  we've appropriated your memes and we've appropriated what you're doing so what the right what a lot of
[2:57:53.680 --> 2:57:58.880]  people don't realize is things that we do wrong on the right we don't do activism well and we don't
[2:57:58.880 --> 2:58:03.840]  coordinate so paul agrado tell you we don't talk about what we're going to tweet about we don't
[2:58:03.840 --> 2:58:09.280]  have a meeting what is the there is no right wing conspiracy and in a way that works to our detriment
[2:58:09.280 --> 2:58:15.840]  because a lot of times we're off we're off message so we need more community more connection more
[2:58:15.840 --> 2:58:20.480]  activism more happy hours more meetups call what you want we're gonna march on google that's what
[2:58:20.480 --> 2:58:26.400]  we're gonna do we're gonna come back in the final segment final few minutes with mike cernovich

[3:00:11.520 --> 3:00:19.760]  and now your host paul joseph watson
[3:00:23.440 --> 3:00:29.520]  we are back and we are into the fourth hour david night is coming up in a few minutes with huge
[3:00:29.520 --> 3:00:35.520]  fresh breaking news but we've got the final few minutes here with mike sernovich mike they were
[3:00:35.520 --> 3:00:41.360]  completely shocked that hillary lost the election they never saw it coming their own hubris trip them
[3:00:41.360 --> 3:00:48.720]  up you know 99 chance of hillary winning she lost they were shocked they were shell shocked now we're
[3:00:48.720 --> 3:00:53.760]  getting the backlash we've often had this debate of you know if hillary had of one info wars would
[3:00:53.760 --> 3:00:59.200]  have been shot shut down they would have come after us i i kind of think it's it's happening
[3:00:59.200 --> 3:01:04.480]  anyway maybe it's even worse now maybe if hillary had of one they'd have got the political power
[3:01:04.480 --> 3:01:09.600]  they might have backed off they might have treated us less importantly because they thought we had
[3:01:09.600 --> 3:01:15.360]  less power do you think the fact that she lost and they were so shocked by it has made that backlash
[3:01:15.360 --> 3:01:20.160]  even more intense in a way they're vindictive people i don't think they would have ever backed off
[3:01:20.160 --> 3:01:26.080]  that hasn't been true but that's one one way to look at is maybe they would have they are looking
[3:01:26.080 --> 3:01:32.320]  for scapegoats and i think it's funny because i reach this is how dumb these people are on twitter
[3:01:32.320 --> 3:01:37.440]  gling remwalt who's a you know progressive burning up standard supporter said why hasn't
[3:01:37.440 --> 3:01:42.960]  there been a post-mortem for the dnc why haven't they realized that running a globalist candidate
[3:01:42.960 --> 3:01:47.440]  with parkinson's disease was a bad idea and i retweeted it and now they're trying to say oh
[3:01:47.440 --> 3:01:52.000]  wow you know glinker and well got retweeted by my son of it that becomes a story that's how basic
[3:01:52.000 --> 3:01:57.760]  and just dumb they are they don't get it hillary clinton sucks the message you left is bad there's
[3:01:57.760 --> 3:02:03.600]  terrorism everywhere they're rape mobs you can't go in sweden you you can't even have a festival
[3:02:03.600 --> 3:02:10.000]  hardly they almost canceled um the the beer festival munich october fest there's rape everywhere
[3:02:10.000 --> 3:02:16.320]  rape is everywhere in europe people watched it in real time remember how the fake news media
[3:02:16.320 --> 3:02:22.320]  refused to cover the cologne sexual sexual attacks yeah like a real for days so people now realize
[3:02:22.320 --> 3:02:27.920]  there's rape everywhere in europe they're rape mobs roving where it's not even safe they don't want
[3:02:27.920 --> 3:02:32.400]  that the people don't want that i have a daughter i have a wife people don't want the government
[3:02:32.400 --> 3:02:38.800]  importing massive rape mobs and they're living it day to day so they know that when the mainstream
[3:02:38.800 --> 3:02:43.920]  lies and say it's all creation of the of the hateful right wing they know it's not true because they
[3:02:43.920 --> 3:02:48.080]  live in these areas where these migrants are being brought in and they all they are being
[3:02:48.080 --> 3:02:52.800]  being brought in that's the point i made the boats go out 11 miles off the coast of libya
[3:02:52.800 --> 3:02:58.560]  and bring them in like a taxi service the e you these NGO groups doing this they're using these
[3:02:58.560 --> 3:03:04.320]  migrants as a weapon against the west and they want to blame you they want to blame info wars
[3:03:04.320 --> 3:03:10.320]  they want to attack all of us rather than just say wow maybe our ideas suck maybe our ideas are bad
[3:03:10.320 --> 3:03:14.640]  maybe they're terrible they want to go after us but i know that as the segment ends i'm going to
[3:03:14.640 --> 3:03:19.600]  have some bone broth so i i'm definitely going to try the bone broth stuff that alex jones has
[3:03:19.600 --> 3:03:23.520]  the new product because i'm really into that stuff it's good for the college and college and
[3:03:23.520 --> 3:03:28.160]  growth i've been taking i think you've definitely earned it and this the skincare tips were really
[3:03:28.160 --> 3:03:32.400]  appreciated but you know i think that i think info wars needs a skincare line you know but
[3:03:32.400 --> 3:03:36.720]  that's a different subject but yeah i'm definitely i haven't tried the caveman true paleo formula so
[3:03:36.720 --> 3:03:41.120]  i can't like i only endorse things that i use and i believe in so i haven't tried it yet but if i
[3:03:41.120 --> 3:03:45.760]  like and by the way guys he'll tell you i'm honest i'm not getting paid for this they're doing me a
[3:03:45.760 --> 3:03:51.520]  favor by having me on so i'm nobody's paying me to plug anything but i i practice what i preach
[3:03:51.520 --> 3:03:55.600]  they're doing great things they're breaking news and i'm going to support it in any way that i
[3:03:55.600 --> 3:04:01.440]  possibly can and there's no way you're going to shame us out of selling products god forbid
[3:04:01.440 --> 3:04:06.400]  we're selling products that people give five star reviews for we're not taking fat checks from
[3:04:06.400 --> 3:04:12.000]  george soros we're not funded literally like cnn by gulf state dictatorships who pay them
[3:04:12.000 --> 3:04:18.400]  to produce puff pieces about how great bar rain is as they're literally mowing down protesters on
[3:04:18.400 --> 3:04:23.280]  the street yeah there's a reason you never find any critical news coverage of saudi arabia even
[3:04:23.280 --> 3:04:28.240]  though women are impressed in saudi arabia the soddies gave money the clinton foundation
[3:04:28.240 --> 3:04:32.560]  to buy children from haydie they're bombing the amenities and christians they're killing christians
[3:04:32.560 --> 3:04:37.200]  everywhere you'll never see that in the fake news because saudi arabia owns american media
[3:04:37.200 --> 3:04:42.880]  you the people own info wars by supporting them daily that's going to wrap it up for the show

[3:05:03.440 --> 3:05:08.400]  popularity the hotel industry is freaking out and progressive democrats are responding first the
[3:05:08.400 --> 3:05:13.200]  federal trade commission requested an investigation be done into how air bnb was affecting the housing
[3:05:13.200 --> 3:05:18.240]  market why waste our money on that i'm not sure but governor of new york andrew qualmo signed a
[3:05:18.240 --> 3:05:23.040]  bill making it a finable offense to post on air bnb another example of the government getting
[3:05:23.040 --> 3:05:27.360]  involved in private business where it doesn't belong if you violate a lease that is between
[3:05:27.360 --> 3:05:32.080]  you and your leaseholder but now the government has a preemptive strike against the air bnb host
[3:05:32.080 --> 3:05:37.200]  you can be sure this is a result of the hotel industry lobbying our fine politicians linda
[3:05:37.200 --> 3:05:42.000]  rosenthal a manhattan democrat who sponsored the bill said this sets a standard for those
[3:05:42.000 --> 3:05:46.880]  struggling with the impact of air bnb on affordable housing which doesn't even make sense because
[3:05:46.880 --> 3:05:51.760]  innovation and competition always lowers cost but these are democrats we're talking about here so

[3:07:54.320 --> 3:08:05.040]  from in the world or what your religious background is we are unstoppable together live from the
[3:08:05.040 --> 3:08:13.520]  info wars dot com studios you're listening to the alex joneshow and now your host david night
[3:08:16.560 --> 3:08:18.720]  welcome back to the fourth hour of the alex joneshow
[3:08:18.720 --> 3:08:26.320]  i'm david night and uh we're gonna take a look at some of the breaking news here with google going
[3:08:26.320 --> 3:08:32.160]  to war with the first amendment especially going to war with info wars first but i think uh where
[3:08:32.160 --> 3:08:36.960]  i want to start today is something that kind of hit close to home because it's an area where my
[3:08:36.960 --> 3:08:45.920]  wife grew up on long island and uh now this area is having rampant ms-13 gang violence this is a
[3:08:45.920 --> 3:08:51.360]  story that broke on friday four bodies found on long island they appear to be linked to gang
[3:08:51.360 --> 3:08:57.040]  violence they say a phone call came on a wednesday night this is uh somebody got a call said i see
[3:08:57.040 --> 3:09:02.400]  a brother he was getting killed they say four bodies of young people have been brutally killed
[3:09:02.400 --> 3:09:09.120]  near park in suffolk county and one of these guys all these people actually are hispanic so this is
[3:09:09.120 --> 3:09:15.440]  not a situation of racism these are people who uh want to live peacefully and quietly maybe that's
[3:09:15.440 --> 3:09:20.640]  why they fled that area but because we don't have any control over the border anyone who wants to come
[3:09:20.640 --> 3:09:25.280]  here and live here peacefully uh is going to be joined by the same people that they fled and they're
[3:09:25.280 --> 3:09:28.560]  going to be living in our communities as well and this is already happening in suffolk county the
[3:09:28.560 --> 3:09:32.640]  suffolk county police commissioner said a news conference that the four had been killed in a
[3:09:32.640 --> 3:09:41.680]  manner that was consistent with the mo of ms-13 and of course ms-13 began had its roots in illegal
[3:09:41.680 --> 3:09:48.560]  immigration a massive number of people who illegally immigrated into la then connected that they said
[3:09:48.560 --> 3:09:55.600]  for their own protection connected with gangs back in central america and el salvador and now
[3:09:55.600 --> 3:10:01.440]  they were responsible just last year for 11 deaths that they found they point out they said there's
[3:10:01.440 --> 3:10:05.360]  no question that we still have ms-13 in suffolk county and that was in spite of what happened
[3:10:05.360 --> 3:10:11.200]  in september in september they found the bodies of a 16 year old and a 15 year old uh this was in
[3:10:11.200 --> 3:10:16.560]  brintwood a neighboring town this is all over long island any of you who don't know the area long
[3:10:16.560 --> 3:10:22.240]  island is kind of a suburb of new york city all these small communities have grown together into
[3:10:23.120 --> 3:10:28.640]  megalopolis this there so all these small communities now are afflicted with ms-13
[3:10:28.640 --> 3:10:34.320]  because it's organized crime because the root of all of this what is the root of our immigration
[3:10:34.320 --> 3:10:41.440]  problem is really the war on drugs and our welfare system acting as a magnet the welfare system
[3:10:41.440 --> 3:10:47.600]  brings in people who know that they can get free education and other free services but also it
[3:10:47.600 --> 3:10:52.640]  brings in the criminal element we want to come in here because they can have a very lucrative
[3:10:52.640 --> 3:10:58.320]  monopoly whenever you create drug prohibition what you do is you give a market a black market
[3:10:58.320 --> 3:11:01.920]  monopoly to the people who want to run it we've seen it all before we saw it in alcohol prohibition
[3:11:01.920 --> 3:11:09.600]  we saw it with al Capone and others why can't we learn the lesson we've done this now for 46 years
[3:11:09.600 --> 3:11:15.760]  we're going on a 46th year of the war on drugs that was declared by Richard Nixon it's unconstitutional
[3:11:15.760 --> 3:11:20.960]  by the way at least when they had the failed alcohol prohibition they created an amendment
[3:11:20.960 --> 3:11:24.720]  to do it because they understood that they didn't have the power to do this under the commerce
[3:11:24.720 --> 3:11:30.400]  clause that's the fiction under which they operate the illegal war on drugs but you need to also
[3:11:30.400 --> 3:11:36.880]  understand that it's got a UN component it's another UN agenda this was the war on drugs was
[3:11:36.880 --> 3:11:41.760]  an agenda with all the four schedules with all the drugs put into all those four schedules that
[3:11:41.760 --> 3:11:47.040]  was created by the UN it was created exactly 10 years before Richard Nixon did it of course
[3:11:47.040 --> 3:11:51.920]  everybody thought that he invented that no it was created by the UN and then the United States
[3:11:51.920 --> 3:11:57.760]  just enacted it verbatim so they talk about the murders back in September it was something that
[3:11:57.760 --> 3:12:01.760]  got everybody's attention because they were so brutal the teenagers had been beaten to death
[3:12:01.760 --> 3:12:08.000]  with baseball bats and machetes beaten to death with baseball bats and machetes the same violence
[3:12:08.000 --> 3:12:13.840]  we see throughout Mexico which by the way more people have died there than have died in Afghanistan
[3:12:13.840 --> 3:12:20.400]  and the war is there that is coming to our shore see the open borders bring in the drug war bring
[3:12:20.400 --> 3:12:27.440]  in the islamic war of terror brings all that into us it imports all that chaos it imports all that
[3:12:27.440 --> 3:12:35.200]  terrorism and it ports all that crime into us a wall is something that would maybe help but it
[3:12:35.200 --> 3:12:38.880]  is not the solution you have to go to the root cause of it it's not going to do any good to
[3:12:38.880 --> 3:12:45.680]  have a war a wall when you still give people the kind of welfare benefits that to them are just
[3:12:45.680 --> 3:12:51.920]  irresistible you put a big magnet there and no matter how tiny you try to make the holes
[3:12:51.920 --> 3:12:56.160]  the people will squeeze through to come to this country and so will the criminals because it's
[3:12:56.160 --> 3:13:01.680]  so lucrative and so will the dedicated terrorists they will find a way to get in as well we have
[3:13:01.680 --> 3:13:08.160]  to stop the wars that we do in terms of regime change that creates terrorism chaos and war in
[3:13:08.160 --> 3:13:12.960]  those areas why don't the liberals push back against the war why don't they push back against
[3:13:12.960 --> 3:13:17.840]  the root cause why don't they push back against the war on drugs that is killing so many people
[3:13:17.840 --> 3:13:22.880]  in Mexico and Central America why don't they push back on that we know why they talk about the
[3:13:22.880 --> 3:13:28.240]  fact that when this happened in september these two individuals they've been beaten with machetes
[3:13:28.240 --> 3:13:33.280]  and baseball bats brutally murdered they started investigating and then they found the skeletal
[3:13:33.280 --> 3:13:39.360]  remains of three teenage boys and eventually they arrested more than 125 gang members in march
[3:13:39.360 --> 3:13:45.200]  federal authorities charged 13 adult members of ms 13 with a variety of crimes including
[3:13:45.200 --> 3:13:50.400]  racketeering and murder 10 were undocumented immigrants prosecutors said so 10 out of the
[3:13:50.400 --> 3:13:56.960]  13 that were charged were undocumented immigrants see we can't even when they beat people to death
[3:13:56.960 --> 3:14:04.400]  with machetes and baseball bats we can't find it and amongst ourselves and of course the people
[3:14:04.400 --> 3:14:08.720]  who are reporting this is the new york times the new york times can't even call them criminals at
[3:14:08.720 --> 3:14:14.560]  that point see they're foreign citizens and al salvador from the in this instance foreign
[3:14:14.560 --> 3:14:19.760]  citizens who are criminally trespassing in our country but they can't call them that
[3:14:19.760 --> 3:14:24.880]  they won't call them illegal aliens they have to call them undocumented immigrants even though
[3:14:24.880 --> 3:14:31.120]  they are gang members from a foreign country here illegally that's the amazing story to me
[3:14:31.120 --> 3:14:36.800]  but i also want to take a look at this story that mike cernovich who is on just in the last
[3:14:36.800 --> 3:14:42.080]  segment with paul joes of watson the story that he broke i think this is amazing because what we
[3:14:42.080 --> 3:14:47.840]  see here folks is nothing less than google going to war against the first amendment and of course
[3:14:47.840 --> 3:14:53.360]  info wars is their first target google has hired contractors say the article to remove
[3:14:53.360 --> 3:15:00.320]  or to limit alex jones's website info wars dot com from his search engine this is not just somebody
[3:15:00.320 --> 3:15:05.440]  told us this we have documentary proof we have screenshots that were sent to mike cernovich
[3:15:05.440 --> 3:15:12.000]  and we show these in the document here understand what this is truly about there's two things here
[3:15:12.000 --> 3:15:19.120]  number one with operation mockingbird and with just three networks abc mbc and cbs
[3:15:19.840 --> 3:15:24.800]  they were able to give you the same story all the time and present it exactly the same way
[3:15:25.600 --> 3:15:30.640]  give you the same spend on the same stories put out the government's official story anybody who
[3:15:30.640 --> 3:15:35.920]  questioned the government's official story was dismissed as a conspiracy theorist or lunatic
[3:15:35.920 --> 3:15:43.360]  fringe they lost control of that narrative and they have said hey you know the the people on this
[3:15:43.360 --> 3:15:46.640]  now they want to call us fake news they say the fake news influence the election
[3:15:47.280 --> 3:15:51.680]  they controlled elections through their fake narrative for a very long time with operation
[3:15:51.680 --> 3:15:55.440]  mockingbird and so what they're trying to do is trying to get it back and they're trying to get
[3:15:55.440 --> 3:16:01.760]  it back also for profit reasons but it's also a political power play see when you want to get
[3:16:01.760 --> 3:16:05.040]  monopolies handed to you by the government and we'll talk about that here in a moment
[3:16:05.040 --> 3:16:11.440]  when google and others want monopolies they do a scratch my back i'll scratch your type of thing
[3:16:11.440 --> 3:16:16.400]  with the government this is what they're doing right now saying info wars articles must be rated
[3:16:16.400 --> 3:16:20.640]  low to medium they say you should be mindful of where the article comes in other words don't
[3:16:20.640 --> 3:16:26.080]  look at what it's saying don't exercise your critical thought just dismiss it because of
[3:16:26.080 --> 3:16:31.440]  where it's coming from now that is nonsense and i've even seen that from people who follow me i've
[3:16:31.440 --> 3:16:36.240]  reported things that the washington post has said or the new york times has said and they say well
[3:16:36.240 --> 3:16:41.280]  you can't trust that that's why i see the source i'm not going to pay attention to that well that's
[3:16:41.280 --> 3:16:46.400]  nonsense read the source and just as i pointed out in this last story with new york times
[3:16:46.400 --> 3:16:50.400]  they gave factual information and then they spent it by saying well some of them were
[3:16:50.400 --> 3:16:56.000]  undocumented immigrants but they do tell you if you read between the lines that 10 out of 13 of
[3:16:56.000 --> 3:17:02.240]  these people were foreign citizens criminally trespassing and killing people with machetes
[3:17:02.880 --> 3:17:09.200]  as they are acting as a as a drug gang what they want to do is establish a system
[3:17:09.200 --> 3:17:15.920]  that they've had before it was true because walter kronkite said so that's the way it is right so
[3:17:15.920 --> 3:17:22.720]  because he said so it was true you establish the argument from authority i'm the person in authority
[3:17:22.720 --> 3:17:27.040]  so therefore it's true if it's coming from cnn it's true if it's coming from info wars it's not
[3:17:27.040 --> 3:17:33.280]  true and you can dismiss that right away that is precisely what uh google is saying with this and
[3:17:33.280 --> 3:17:37.680]  of course even if it is something that is linked to by drudge and drudge links to the new york
[3:17:37.680 --> 3:17:42.160]  times it links to washington post cnn all these different places as well but if drudge linked
[3:17:42.160 --> 3:17:47.920]  to it it's also fake news so you can you can count on that what they're trying to do is establish
[3:17:47.920 --> 3:17:54.240]  complete control over the news media as they did before and we may say well there's a lot of different
[3:17:54.240 --> 3:17:58.560]  outlets out there there's there's info wars there's bright bar there's daily call or there's social
[3:17:58.560 --> 3:18:05.440]  media you can pass the information around but we've also seen how the different news organizations
[3:18:05.440 --> 3:18:11.040]  have been tightly consolidated less than five companies own everything it's uh that was that
[3:18:11.040 --> 3:18:19.280]  a couple of years ago i'm sure it's less than that now and so in terms of corporate control it's even
[3:18:19.280 --> 3:18:24.480]  tighter control than it was during the days we just had three networks because in those days
[3:18:24.480 --> 3:18:31.520]  we had some vibrant local newspapers as well that would come into the mix but the mainstream media
[3:18:31.520 --> 3:18:36.240]  that was broadcast media was tightly controlled they want to reestablish that tight control
[3:18:36.240 --> 3:18:40.720]  that they've lost with the internet they go in here as a bonus example they say well what about
[3:18:40.720 --> 3:18:45.760]  this news article and they use the example of the sod this is the article that adan salazar put out
[3:18:45.760 --> 3:18:50.720]  last friday and so this is something that has just happened uh that they've just put this out this
[3:18:50.720 --> 3:18:55.200]  weekend mike sernovich got this document right away so they say what about this news article
[3:18:55.200 --> 3:19:01.680]  here's another one from cnn covers the same subject that info wars did okay they say we give this a
[3:19:01.680 --> 3:19:08.000]  rating of high to high plus even though we give info wars the lowest rating why well they say
[3:19:08.000 --> 3:19:12.560]  while cnn isn't a perfect news outlet it's a popular news source it covers a story with
[3:19:12.560 --> 3:19:17.200]  depth and straightforward reporting why is that well because we talked to people like congressman
[3:19:17.200 --> 3:19:23.840]  ron paul and they said uh that cuts against the grain to say the least see that's exactly what we
[3:19:23.840 --> 3:19:30.080]  do we cut against the grain we deviate from the official government story even when the president
[3:19:30.080 --> 3:19:35.520]  is somebody that we supported donald trump we're not going to blindly follow him now you see those
[3:19:35.520 --> 3:19:42.160]  cnn is cnn is following it because why it's about their agenda they are not objective we need to
[3:19:42.160 --> 3:19:47.120]  understand that they're coming from a ideological standpoint they're selling the government's
[3:19:47.120 --> 3:19:53.360]  neocon military industrial complex agenda we're pushing back against that they call us fake we'll
[3:19:53.360 --> 3:20:02.960]  be right back this is the story of the shaving company called harry's in an epic battle of david

[3:24:19.760 --> 3:24:24.480]  and we're taking a look at the attack on info wars by google this is absolutely amazing what mike
[3:24:24.480 --> 3:24:29.120]  sernovich showed us over the weekend and this is something where they use as an example a story
[3:24:29.120 --> 3:24:35.920]  that came out on friday and so they wasted no time the whistleblowers and getting this to us
[3:24:35.920 --> 3:24:40.880]  that it's very important that we understand what their tactics are and it's not just suppressing
[3:24:40.880 --> 3:24:45.120]  political speech of course they have a vested economic interest in that there's a great story
[3:24:45.120 --> 3:24:49.440]  by drum coursey on info wars dot com that points that out i'm going to get to that in just a moment
[3:24:49.440 --> 3:24:55.040]  before we do i want to point out that we have a way for you to help us as they try to shut us down
[3:24:55.040 --> 3:25:01.200]  they're working against us economically as well in other words i want to block sites like ours
[3:25:01.200 --> 3:25:06.560]  and breitbart and daily caller from accepting ads from people saying that we're an unacceptable site
[3:25:06.560 --> 3:25:11.840]  to have ads served on then they want to block our supplement ads which are from a completely
[3:25:11.840 --> 3:25:17.840]  separate site there's a picture of a supplement and they want to make sure that that doesn't go out
[3:25:17.840 --> 3:25:22.080]  so they block us putting our ads on other people they block us accepting ads from other people
[3:25:22.080 --> 3:25:26.160]  they're trying to shut us down economically and now what they're trying to do is shut down our
[3:25:26.160 --> 3:25:32.880]  content and we've seen this with facebook working with government agencies to identify as they point
[3:25:32.880 --> 3:25:38.240]  out fake news sources and now what they're saying is everything that we do is fake and they give the
[3:25:38.240 --> 3:25:44.240]  example of the same story from the same angle essentially covered by us and by cnn you can trust
[3:25:44.240 --> 3:25:48.880]  cnn and rate it highly but info wars is totally fake and you should downright that so that people
[3:25:48.880 --> 3:25:53.520]  don't see it we've already seen this with apple news and other sites so if you want to support us
[3:25:53.520 --> 3:25:59.040]  one way that you can do it is to go direct and you can we've also put out a special we've extended

[3:27:03.520 --> 3:27:08.720]  that i want to go back to this story and i want to look at the example that they gave which was
[3:27:08.720 --> 3:27:14.960]  adan's story from april the 13th and in it what we did was reported that asad said that the u.s had
[3:27:14.960 --> 3:27:20.000]  fabricated chemical weapons attack that these videos could be staged he said the west fabricated
[3:27:20.000 --> 3:27:25.120]  the whole story in order to have a pretext for the attack now we said that we believe that this was
[3:27:26.080 --> 3:27:30.320]  being used from the very beginning we said this and of course we said it four years ago
[3:27:30.880 --> 3:27:37.360]  and uh we were joined in that by donald trump at the time who said well we need to do an investigation
[3:27:37.360 --> 3:27:42.640]  before we act hastily and we also have a requirement that the constitution uh be invoked we were not
[3:27:42.640 --> 3:27:47.520]  under an emergency attack this was something that should have been done deliberately we should have
[3:27:47.520 --> 3:27:54.960]  had an investigation and when i reported this story i also pointed out that asad jumped the
[3:27:54.960 --> 3:27:59.840]  shark of it when he said nobody died so we don't believe that you can look at that and i believe
[3:27:59.840 --> 3:28:03.920]  people died i don't think that that part of it was fake but the question is where did it come from
[3:28:03.920 --> 3:28:10.800]  whenever you do an investigation if the government has a an official story that they
[3:28:10.800 --> 3:28:16.800]  want to stick to and an action that immediately follows that official story without an investigation
[3:28:16.800 --> 3:28:22.880]  that is a hallmark that either they created this under false pretenses or they are spinning real
[3:28:22.880 --> 3:28:26.720]  events in order to use it for something that they've already decided they want to do like
[3:28:26.720 --> 3:28:32.080]  having a shooting immediately being spun to enact gun control and so we pointed that out
[3:28:32.080 --> 3:28:35.680]  and we said we don't need to rush into this because we see that every time they've got an
[3:28:35.680 --> 3:28:41.280]  action that is already set up and they don't want to do any investigation you can bet that
[3:28:41.280 --> 3:28:44.640]  they're not telling you the truth about what's going on so we want to have an investigation
[3:28:44.640 --> 3:28:49.280]  when you have an investigation what do you do you look at the motive and in this story adan
[3:28:49.280 --> 3:28:56.320]  quotes ron paul which according to google was enough reason for this story to be delisted
[3:28:56.320 --> 3:29:02.640]  and put down at the lowest possible source because we're looking at what ron paul says says
[3:29:02.640 --> 3:29:07.280]  this is what ron paul said though absolutely does make sense he said it doesn't make any sense for
[3:29:07.280 --> 3:29:12.480]  a sod under these conditions to all of a sudden use poison gas i think there's zero chance he
[3:29:12.480 --> 3:29:16.000]  would have done this deliberately see when you're doing an investigation what you want to do is
[3:29:16.000 --> 3:29:21.760]  you want to look at who has a motive who had insurance on this person this wealthy person
[3:29:21.760 --> 3:29:27.920]  who was just killed under circumstances that are questionable well it might be that those people
[3:29:27.920 --> 3:29:32.160]  are the ones who did it but maybe if the guy doesn't benefit from this maybe if it benefits
[3:29:32.160 --> 3:29:36.880]  these other people maybe he's not your primary suspect then you want to start looking at something
[3:29:36.880 --> 3:29:41.120]  called evidence and you want to have an investigation but if you do that when the government's already
[3:29:41.120 --> 3:29:45.920]  concocted its official story and the follow-up operation you're denounced as a conspiracy
[3:29:45.920 --> 3:29:53.600]  theorist and google wants to make sure nobody hears you the empires on the run alex jones and the gcm

[3:30:03.760 --> 3:30:10.240]  vatican museums cash visa mastercard or needle is accepted that's right you can give blood to
[3:30:10.240 --> 3:30:15.200]  access the vatican museum the blood payment plan has a slogan give blood and follow your
[3:30:15.200 --> 3:30:20.240]  artistic inclination blood donors then receive a voucher which gives them access to the museums
[3:30:20.240 --> 3:30:26.000]  the director of the vatican museum said without blood there is no life without art life would be
[3:30:26.000 --> 3:30:33.520]  empty and sad okay i love jesus too happy easter i guess this is a good idea get some blood donations
[3:30:33.520 --> 3:30:38.960]  and allow people access to history sounds harmless but wait each blood donation is good for a four
[3:30:38.960 --> 3:30:45.600]  euro voucher it costs 16 euros to access the museums so you have to donate blood four times before you
[3:30:45.600 --> 3:30:51.600]  can even get in by the time you've given enough blood you'd have fainted enjoy michael angelo's

[3:33:19.760 --> 3:33:24.400]  welcome back to the alex joneshow i'm david night and we've been looking at google going to war
[3:33:24.400 --> 3:33:29.360]  with the first amendment going to war first with info wars you have to understand the principle
[3:33:29.360 --> 3:33:33.840]  that's involved here the idea that if they're going to label things as true or false and if
[3:33:33.840 --> 3:33:39.120]  they're going to take entire news organizations and say even though this story is coming from info
[3:33:39.120 --> 3:33:44.560]  wars you need to make that the lowest possible but if it's coming from cnn oh rate that high or high
[3:33:44.560 --> 3:33:51.600]  plus see that's directly targeting people for destruction because they have lost control of
[3:33:51.600 --> 3:33:56.800]  the narrative and they want to get it back we need to uh crowd source this is one of the things that
[3:33:56.800 --> 3:34:01.840]  paul and mike were talking about was the importance of the comment section and the fact that so many
[3:34:01.840 --> 3:34:06.320]  of them have now removed their comment sections because people weren't buying what the mainstream
[3:34:06.320 --> 3:34:10.320]  media was telling them and they were having their own uh i guess you could call it's kind of like
[3:34:10.320 --> 3:34:14.560]  what the we had at the time of the revolution we had committees of correspondence where people
[3:34:14.560 --> 3:34:19.520]  would talk to each other tell each other what's really going on because there was control always
[3:34:19.520 --> 3:34:23.280]  has been control on information but let's take a look at the story that they picked out the one
[3:34:23.280 --> 3:34:29.600]  about a sod today we had an article from the international business times they're saying
[3:34:29.600 --> 3:34:34.640]  well this is not uh this is not credible because we've got a sod saying it we got ron paul saying
[3:34:34.640 --> 3:34:42.080]  it we've got info wars saying it now we've got an mit expert saying it theodore postel of mit
[3:34:42.080 --> 3:34:48.640]  says there was no concrete evidence linking a sod to the attack this guy is a leading weapons
[3:34:48.640 --> 3:34:55.440]  academic he has claimed that the nerve agent attack in syria was staged raising questions
[3:34:55.440 --> 3:35:00.480]  about who was responsible theodore postel is a professor emeritus at the massachusetts institute
[3:35:00.480 --> 3:35:06.800]  of technology mit he concluded that the u.s. government's report does not provide any concrete
[3:35:06.800 --> 3:35:11.840]  evidence that a sod was responsible adding it was more likely that the attack was perpetrated by
[3:35:11.840 --> 3:35:16.720]  players on the ground he said i have reviewed the white house's document carefully i believe it can
[3:35:16.720 --> 3:35:24.160]  be shown without doubt that the document does not provide any evidence whatsoever that the u.s.
[3:35:24.160 --> 3:35:28.480]  government has concrete knowledge that the government of syria was a source of the chemical attack
[3:35:29.200 --> 3:35:33.440]  in fact he said a main piece of evidence that they've shown as a photograph
[3:35:33.440 --> 3:35:38.320]  that cited in the document to point the attack uh shows that it was executed by individuals on the
[3:35:38.320 --> 3:35:43.600]  ground and not from an aircraft now let's take a look pull up that picture that's in the article there
[3:35:43.600 --> 3:35:49.360]  he looks at this uh this picture that one right there he says look there's a small crater in the
[3:35:49.360 --> 3:35:54.560]  ground now the image he refers to is a crater with a shell inside that's supposed to have
[3:35:54.560 --> 3:35:59.520]  poison gas in it his analysis of the shell suggests that it could not have been dropped
[3:35:59.520 --> 3:36:06.000]  from an airplane as the damage of the casing is inconsistent with an aerial explosion he said it
[3:36:06.000 --> 3:36:11.120]  was more likely that an explosive charge was laid upon the shell before being detonated
[3:36:11.120 --> 3:36:17.840]  he says this the explosive acted on the pipe as a blunt crushing mallet you see how it's crushed
[3:36:17.840 --> 3:36:24.960]  in instead of exploded out it drove the pipe into the ground while at the same time creating the
[3:36:24.960 --> 3:36:31.840]  crater he said no competent analysis would miss the fact that the alleged sarin canister was
[3:36:31.840 --> 3:36:40.160]  forcefully crushed from above rather than exploded by munition within all of these highly amateurish
[3:36:40.160 --> 3:36:47.760]  mistakes this is an mit weapons expert okay this is a guy who was a scientific advisor at the
[3:36:47.760 --> 3:36:54.960]  department of defense he went there in 2013 when he had a similar false flag that was being used to
[3:36:54.960 --> 3:36:59.760]  get us involved in war and again that doesn't mean that nobody was killed what it means is
[3:36:59.760 --> 3:37:04.880]  that they had a gas attack and they immediately wanted to say well this was the Assad regime so
[3:37:04.880 --> 3:37:10.640]  therefore we should act as al-qaeda's air force we should send troops and this should be the basis
[3:37:10.640 --> 3:37:15.920]  for an immediate attack without any kind of investigation without any deliberation by congress
[3:37:16.800 --> 3:37:22.800]  so we have that in the constitution we're supposed to take the time to make this determination if
[3:37:22.800 --> 3:37:27.760]  it's not an emergency this is not an emergency the us is not under attack we have the time
[3:37:27.760 --> 3:37:34.880]  to follow the law that they all swore to follow that gives them their authority once we decide
[3:37:34.880 --> 3:37:40.400]  that we want to go to war that it is warranted then that is going to be our strategy then the
[3:37:40.400 --> 3:37:45.840]  tactics can be decided by the generals and by the president because at that point it needs to be
[3:37:45.840 --> 3:37:50.240]  done quickly it needs to be done secretly but the deliberation the decision as to whether or not
[3:37:50.240 --> 3:37:56.000]  we go to war does not is should not be done immediately without any deliberation without
[3:37:56.000 --> 3:38:01.120]  a vote as required by the constitution now this person who was a former scientific advisor to
[3:38:01.120 --> 3:38:07.760]  the department of defense an MIT professor emeritus and again he pointed out in 2013
[3:38:08.640 --> 3:38:14.640]  that the evidence did not suggest that Assad was responsible that was also later corroborated by the
[3:38:14.640 --> 3:38:19.680]  united nations and others the pentagon also said that that's one of the reasons why that whole thing
[3:38:19.680 --> 3:38:25.600]  fell apart and when this all began we said at the very beginning we have seen this movie before
[3:38:25.600 --> 3:38:30.880]  we need to take our time we need to not shoot missiles from the hip we need to understand
[3:38:30.880 --> 3:38:36.320]  that this was once we do an investigation you will find that their evidence does not hold up
[3:38:36.320 --> 3:38:41.040]  now we find a week later that the evidence does not hold up he said all these highly
[3:38:41.040 --> 3:38:46.880]  amateurish mistakes indicate that this white house report like the earlier obama white house
[3:38:46.880 --> 3:38:54.720]  report in 2013 was not properly vetted by the intelligence community as they claimed he said
[3:38:54.720 --> 3:38:59.680]  i've worked with the intelligence community in the past and i have grave concerns about
[3:38:59.680 --> 3:39:06.320]  the politicization of intelligence that seems to be occurring with more frequency in recent times
[3:39:06.320 --> 3:39:13.120]  boy that is a mild academic understatement of what we're seeing here from the military industrial
[3:39:13.120 --> 3:39:19.520]  complex interesting enough today we have a story we put on on info wars dot com this picture where
[3:39:19.520 --> 3:39:25.600]  kim jong un's missiles faked he has this big parade and in the background of this bbc reporter
[3:39:25.600 --> 3:39:33.680]  you see this missile there and the nose count is like tilted up okay and i tweeted out okay i guess
[3:39:33.680 --> 3:39:40.880]  in the case of north korea icbm means i can't believe it's a missile because this looks absolutely
[3:39:40.880 --> 3:39:49.920]  ridiculous and you know we're now as this they're trying to create a situation saying this is so
[3:39:49.920 --> 3:39:55.760]  critical we've got to act right now we've had this situation for 64 years we've had this tense
[3:39:55.760 --> 3:40:00.160]  situation the war has technically never ended between the us and north korea we've just had a
[3:40:00.160 --> 3:40:06.080]  ceasefire for 64 years but now things have changed now we have to do something about it really really
[3:40:06.080 --> 3:40:11.600]  is that really what we we have i mean yeah north korea is going to continue to test missiles weekly
[3:40:11.600 --> 3:40:16.640]  until they get it right until they can get one actually off the launch pad are we really threatened
[3:40:16.640 --> 3:40:23.120]  by this and is this the way that we need to do this by starting a nuclear war at any moment
[3:40:23.120 --> 3:40:29.680]  that's the top of the drudge report right now nuke war at any moment great great that's not what i
[3:40:29.680 --> 3:40:35.840]  voted for that's not what i voted for and let me tell you before we go into uh what this is all
[3:40:35.840 --> 3:40:42.480]  designed to cover up let's talk about google's economic situation and all this you have to
[3:40:42.480 --> 3:40:48.400]  understand that as this was going back and forth we had the isp rule and everybody was saying
[3:40:48.400 --> 3:40:54.640]  trump is attacking and destroying your privacy they never complain under obama when the nsa was
[3:40:54.640 --> 3:40:59.040]  doing all this stuff right they pretended that none of that stuff happened instead now it's
[3:40:59.040 --> 3:41:03.920]  trump is coming after your privacy they're not have a problem with google and facebook collecting
[3:41:03.920 --> 3:41:09.280]  more information than your isp could ever hope to know about you and so it was all trump and
[3:41:09.280 --> 3:41:13.360]  he was coming after your privacy and we pointed out the time no that's not really what's going on
[3:41:14.240 --> 3:41:19.360]  we have an economic competition between the social media companies like google and facebook
[3:41:20.080 --> 3:41:26.640]  versus the people who actually deliver internet to your home the internet service providers the isps
[3:41:27.440 --> 3:41:31.680]  now google and facebook are already monetizing all the information that they collect about you
[3:41:31.680 --> 3:41:36.240]  the isps want to do the same thing and google and facebook say no no no no that would violate
[3:41:36.240 --> 3:41:41.600]  people's privacy it doesn't violate your privacy if google does it doesn't violate your privacy if
[3:41:41.600 --> 3:41:47.520]  facebook does it but it would violate your property if privacy if competitors to google
[3:41:47.520 --> 3:41:53.200]  and facebook were to do it you understand that's what it's about it's also about a competition
[3:41:53.200 --> 3:41:59.520]  within the government agencies so we have some government agencies like the fcc under obama
[3:41:59.520 --> 3:42:05.680]  and uh the federal communications commission the people who had been tasked to essentially
[3:42:06.400 --> 3:42:13.040]  allocate and distribute a limited number of radio and television frequencies to allocate
[3:42:13.040 --> 3:42:17.360]  that spectrum to people the fcc decided remember they wanted to get into newsrooms they wanted to
[3:42:17.360 --> 3:42:22.880]  see how do you put your news together started to get into content and then they wanted to
[3:42:22.880 --> 3:42:26.720]  extend their control over the internet in general because they're very interested in controlling
[3:42:26.720 --> 3:42:32.480]  content just like google is and so part of the pushback against this obama rule that was put in
[3:42:32.480 --> 3:42:37.680]  at the last minute just before he left part of the pushback against that was a pushback against the
[3:42:37.680 --> 3:42:44.480]  fcc trying to take over the internet and it the pushback was coming from inside the fcc the new
[3:42:44.480 --> 3:42:51.120]  chief ijik pye who was one of the people who was blowing the whistle on the fcc's actions when
[3:42:51.120 --> 3:42:57.520]  obama was in charge of it and when they had the democrats as the chief of the fcc so understand
[3:42:57.520 --> 3:43:02.720]  that we've got all these different competing agencies we've got the fec the federal elections
[3:43:02.720 --> 3:43:08.960]  commission and we had an rebel there saying that uh we need to censor and regulate political
[3:43:08.960 --> 3:43:12.640]  speech on the internet she's still saying that even though she has left the federal election
[3:43:12.640 --> 3:43:18.480]  commission she's still saying that she wanted to uh again she's talking about fake news and how
[3:43:18.480 --> 3:43:24.320]  they've influenced elections and saying that uh she's very concerned because there's so much
[3:43:24.320 --> 3:43:29.520]  information during elections that people can get to on the internet so we have to regulate that
[3:43:30.240 --> 3:43:36.160]  you see the first amendment is first and foremost about protecting political speech it's not about
[3:43:36.160 --> 3:43:41.680]  protecting your ability to get a government grant to put a crucifix and a vada urine which is what
[3:43:41.680 --> 3:43:48.000]  the left seems to think that it's about uh we cannot allow them to use the federal election
[3:43:48.000 --> 3:43:53.040]  commission to shut down drudge to shut down info wars to shut down bright bar to shut down anybody
[3:43:53.040 --> 3:43:57.280]  for whom they don't like the political narrative that people are coming up with the information
[3:43:57.280 --> 3:44:03.520]  they're coming up with we admit our bias cnn doesn't admit their bias fox news doesn't admit their
[3:44:03.520 --> 3:44:10.080]  bias the stories that you choose to report are an expression of your bias everybody has it if
[3:44:10.080 --> 3:44:15.840]  anybody tells you that uh they don't have a bias that they're completely objective those are the
[3:44:15.840 --> 3:44:21.280]  people you need to run from those are the people who are trying to fool you the people who report
[3:44:21.280 --> 3:44:26.320]  the news and then do an analysis of it uh that's fine you understand where they're coming from
[3:44:26.880 --> 3:44:30.720]  and they can make their case you can agree with them or disagree with them you can have that debate
[3:44:30.720 --> 3:44:35.120]  but if they tell you that they've got the truth they're they're true and everybody else is fake
[3:44:35.120 --> 3:44:39.360]  those are the people you need to run away from now in the story from Jerome Corsi he points out
[3:44:39.360 --> 3:44:44.640]  that info wars has previously warned that google and the largest communication giants on the internet
[3:44:44.640 --> 3:44:50.800]  lobbied the federal government to define broadband and the way they would in the 1930s style regulation
[3:44:50.800 --> 3:44:56.800]  when they created the FCC again the purpose was to allocate a limited spectrum for radio or for
[3:44:56.800 --> 3:45:00.720]  television they kind of broadcast medium we don't have that situation on the internet so what they're
[3:45:00.720 --> 3:45:07.840]  trying to do is trying to say well we have limited capacity which simply isn't true but by saying that
[3:45:07.840 --> 3:45:13.760]  they have limited capacity then they push for net neutrality which allows them to then regulate
[3:45:13.760 --> 3:45:18.720]  different industries to advantage one group over the other and allows them to regulate content
[3:45:18.720 --> 3:45:23.040]  that is precisely where we're going so there's a bureaucratic empire battle that's going on between
[3:45:23.040 --> 3:45:27.840]  these different agencies the fdc has had very light control the internet but now the FCC wants to
[3:45:27.840 --> 3:45:33.200]  control it very tightly and google is working with them pushing on that now the story that
[3:45:33.200 --> 3:45:41.280]  Jerome Corsi has put in shows the political funding from soros and from google and he goes down
[3:45:41.280 --> 3:45:45.360]  through a great number of organizations he details this you should take a look at this
[3:45:45.360 --> 3:45:49.840]  detailed report that Jerome Corsi has i want to focus on just one organization the new america
[3:45:49.840 --> 3:45:57.200]  foundation you'll remember about a year and a half ago the new america foundation had an editorial
[3:45:57.200 --> 3:46:00.800]  that i think was uh i think it was cnn that carried it but it was a guy from the new america
[3:46:00.800 --> 3:46:06.160]  foundation who was talking about how we needed to have a north american union passport we needed
[3:46:06.160 --> 3:46:12.160]  to have a north american union passport full on globalists who supports this well google was the
[3:46:12.160 --> 3:46:18.000]  largest corporate contributor to the organization 2016 contributing more than a million dollars google
[3:46:18.000 --> 3:46:22.880]  chairman eric schmidt also contributed more than a million dollars to the new america foundation
[3:46:22.880 --> 3:46:30.800]  and he served as its chairman until 2016 this is an organization that was pushing north american
[3:46:30.800 --> 3:46:36.480]  union and doing it openly we put this article out there and said look at this they said that it
[3:46:36.480 --> 3:46:40.640]  didn't exist that it was a conspiracy theory that there was an idea that we'd have a north american
[3:46:40.640 --> 3:46:46.000]  union we had the council in foreign relations talking about how they needed to have a security
[3:46:46.000 --> 3:46:51.040]  perimeter around the three countries mexico the u.s and canada and that security perimeter would be
[3:46:51.040 --> 3:46:56.640]  run by homeland security here in the u.s just get rid of all internal borders they were pushing
[3:46:56.640 --> 3:47:00.720]  toward a north american union and then we had that article and said look north american union
[3:47:00.720 --> 3:47:05.840]  passport that's what we need so he said look it's it's not a conspiracy they're now admitting it
[3:47:05.840 --> 3:47:13.200]  but who is funding this george soros and google so as we move with this and we understand where
[3:47:13.200 --> 3:47:18.560]  this is headed understand that now you have nothing to fear from google right we have this
[3:47:18.560 --> 3:47:23.280]  story out of australia because american news organizations i guess are afraid to start covering
[3:47:23.280 --> 3:47:30.400]  story stories like this about google because they might get delisted as fake news says fears that
[3:47:30.400 --> 3:47:35.760]  google's hire that's a new piece of software that they're going to offer for people it's a new
[3:47:35.760 --> 3:47:41.040]  project will allow employers to see your entire search history so when you go on to apply for a
[3:47:41.040 --> 3:47:46.800]  job google will obligingly help them to look at everything that you've done online everything
[3:47:46.800 --> 3:47:51.600]  you've searched for all the places that you've gone all the youtube videos that you've looked at
[3:47:51.600 --> 3:47:57.600]  that how do you like that see that's how they monetize you when you got something that is free
[3:47:57.600 --> 3:48:04.000]  folks you are the product you are the product and of course you're the product in terms of
[3:48:04.000 --> 3:48:08.000]  sending this information over to the government as well that's why you should be very concerned
[3:48:08.000 --> 3:48:13.600]  about sysba about syssa is what they wound up calling it at the very end they took out the p
[3:48:13.600 --> 3:48:18.400]  for protection but what they're trying to do is protect google and facebook and any other company
[3:48:18.400 --> 3:48:23.840]  that would turn over information about you to the federal government and not because you're
[3:48:23.840 --> 3:48:29.200]  the subject of an investigation they want your metadata because they want to know
[3:48:29.200 --> 3:48:34.560]  what the crowd is doing the hive what is the hive mind google even calls it well they don't
[3:48:34.560 --> 3:48:40.560]  call it high they call it higher we had the vault seven that was called hive that's the nickname
[3:48:40.560 --> 3:48:46.000]  they gave for it but they want to know what the hive mind is is their narrative that they've created
[3:48:46.000 --> 3:48:51.760]  is it working on the public or do they need to tweak it a little bit say that's why the government
[3:48:51.760 --> 3:48:57.200]  wants to get all of your information so they can control you it isn't necessarily that you are a
[3:48:57.200 --> 3:49:03.200]  suspicious suspect that's something that's coming as well with their minority report
[3:49:03.200 --> 3:49:08.080]  pre-crime analysis they're already well into the software that does that as well you should be very
[3:49:08.080 --> 3:49:14.720]  concerned that because you are part of a political view or part of a certain political spectrum that
[3:49:14.720 --> 3:49:20.720]  they see as a challenge to their domination that they would single you out and accuse you of being
[3:49:20.720 --> 3:49:24.320]  a criminal so that's one thing that you should be concerned about but the other part of it is
[3:49:24.320 --> 3:49:27.840]  that google and facebook and these countries companies will turn yeah that might as well
[3:49:27.840 --> 3:49:32.320]  be countries they will turn this information over to the government so the government can
[3:49:32.880 --> 3:49:38.640]  have a closed feedback loop to see if their propaganda is working on you and one of the
[3:49:38.640 --> 3:49:43.680]  things I want to get to before we run out of time of course today is the day that you have to uh
[3:49:43.680 --> 3:49:49.120]  last day that you can file your tax return of course you can get an extension on it if you want
[3:49:49.120 --> 3:49:53.040]  is anybody talking about this we had the big riots everybody focused on the quote unquote
[3:49:53.040 --> 3:49:58.000]  tax day riots I even put out a hashtag tax day before I realized it was about people who were
[3:49:58.000 --> 3:50:02.160]  only concerned about Donald Trump they weren't concerned about the taxes they were paying
[3:50:02.160 --> 3:50:07.840]  they weren't concerned about the taxes you're paying no it's the politics of envy they want to make
[3:50:07.840 --> 3:50:11.760]  sure that Donald Trump paid taxes they want to see all of his tax returns well I want to see tax
[3:50:11.760 --> 3:50:18.160]  reform I don't really care about Donald Trump's tax returns I want to see Donald Trump's tax reform
[3:50:18.880 --> 3:50:24.960]  and that was completely lost over the weekend with all the narrative about all the military
[3:50:25.520 --> 3:50:30.160]  pageants that we're having all over the world in Syria in North Korea our armada that we're
[3:50:30.160 --> 3:50:35.040]  sending over there to to go after the people who can't even get a missile off the launch pad
[3:50:35.040 --> 3:50:39.200]  what was lost in all that well what was lost in all of that is what they've been doing to us
[3:50:39.200 --> 3:50:44.240]  with the federal reserve what they've been doing to us with the income tax and we had some people
[3:50:44.240 --> 3:50:47.920]  that were not protesting Donald Trump's tax returns but they were protesting in front of the
[3:50:47.920 --> 3:50:55.120]  Trump Tower and saying we want real tax reform nobody reported that nobody reported that stay
[3:50:55.120 --> 3:51:03.200]  with us we'll be right back hiring is the most challenging part of my job it's really hard the

[3:56:01.120 --> 3:56:08.080]  we had a situation as reported by a wnd some people outside trump tower were saying and this
[3:56:08.080 --> 3:56:13.280]  was americans for fair taxation they said it's time to actually do tax reform that's what i'm
[3:56:13.280 --> 3:56:19.600]  concerned about not tax returns of donald trump i'm not interested in this misdirection of wars
[3:56:19.600 --> 3:56:24.800]  and foreign lands i'm not interested in the misdirection of envy which is what these people
[3:56:24.800 --> 3:56:30.160]  are trying to do i want to have real reform and here's a good example i tweeted this out
[3:56:30.160 --> 3:56:36.880]  this is an article from another organization americans for tax reform atr.org 104 years of the
[3:56:36.880 --> 3:56:42.160]  income tax the income tax in 1913 when it was created along with the federal reserve
[3:56:42.160 --> 3:56:49.920]  then and now in 1913 the top marginal income tax bracket was seven percent today it is 39.6
[3:56:49.920 --> 3:56:56.720]  percent from seven percent to 40 percent in 1913 the marginal income tax bracket was between
[3:56:56.720 --> 3:57:04.320]  one and seven percent today that ranges 10 to 40 percent in 1913 there were 400 pages of tax code
[3:57:04.320 --> 3:57:12.240]  today there are 74,608 in 1913 here's the kicker folks as you're doing your taxes at the last minute
[3:57:12.240 --> 3:57:19.520]  the family standard deduction was 98,425 in today's dollars what do you get today
[3:57:19.520 --> 3:57:29.600]  12,600 so it's gone from almost 100,000 to 12.6 and of course there were only 358,000 americans
[3:57:29.600 --> 3:57:35.600]  that even filed a tax return in 1913 when it started that's the way this all starts every
[3:57:35.600 --> 3:57:40.960]  time they do this they create a bureaucracy it's a very very small tax or very very small
[3:57:40.960 --> 3:57:46.640]  burden initially and then it grows and it grows and it grows unless it's something like obama
[3:57:46.640 --> 3:57:52.560]  care and that came on like a lion immediately people started seeing their tax insurance cost
[3:57:52.560 --> 3:57:58.880]  skyrocketing what's going to happen if we don't repeal obama care now they're talking about
[3:57:58.880 --> 3:58:05.120]  making it work better we're going to take a look at the export import bank and donald trump's pivot
[3:58:05.120 --> 3:58:10.400]  to that what does that mean for us in terms of embracing crony capitalism going in ge love it
[3:58:10.400 --> 3:58:16.000]  why because there's only 10 corporations that get 60 percent of this and we are subsidizing foreign
[3:58:16.560 --> 3:58:24.320]  state-owned corporations with taxpayer-funded loans that's ought to make you wonder if we're
[3:58:24.320 --> 3:58:28.400]  making america great again they're reviving that trying to revive that we'll talk about that tonight
[3:58:28.400 --> 3:58:31.840]  on the info wars nightly news at seven central eight p.m eastern
