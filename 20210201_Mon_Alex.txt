[00:00.000 --> 00:24.680]  All right, I got some really, really bad news for everybody, but it's best to know stuff
[00:24.680 --> 00:26.160]  up front, isn't it?
[00:26.160 --> 00:30.320]  It's like Churchill said at the start of World War II, all I can offer you is blood,
[00:30.320 --> 00:34.680]  sweat, tears, and pain, but you won't be a slave at the end of it, and we'll be victorious
[00:34.680 --> 00:37.920]  because the alternative is far worse.
[00:37.920 --> 00:39.160]  So we're inside the New World Order.
[00:39.160 --> 00:41.560]  I have three giant stacks right here.
[00:41.560 --> 00:43.560]  Can I have an overhead shot, please?
[00:43.560 --> 00:45.040]  I have three giant stacks.
[00:45.040 --> 00:51.320]  I probably have 200 articles right here, and I've scanned over and read all of these.
[00:51.320 --> 01:00.240]  And Biden is set to, in the next six months, dial back the restrictions, the martial law,
[01:00.240 --> 01:03.640]  and then they're going to bring in an even bigger lockdown where you're totally locked
[01:03.640 --> 01:05.840]  in your house for at least a year.
[01:05.840 --> 01:09.520]  And we have this from John Hopkins, we have this from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,
[01:09.520 --> 01:12.280]  we have this from the UN, we have this from Singapore.
[01:12.280 --> 01:15.120]  When I saw this last Friday, I began to do a lot of research.
[01:15.120 --> 01:19.840]  I've probably done eight hours of research on this alone.
[01:19.840 --> 01:20.840]  Now why is this so important?
[01:20.840 --> 01:22.880]  Well, it shows you it's all scripted.
[01:22.880 --> 01:29.880]  Remember about eight months ago of the Canadian provincial government in Quebec?
[01:29.880 --> 01:35.400]  A document came out about how they were going to bring in rolling lockdowns, and then how,
[01:35.400 --> 01:42.000]  by early 2021, they would announce new variants as the excuse to continue the lockdowns as
[01:42.000 --> 01:46.800]  part of the great reset to then collapse things, then build back better under their corporate
[01:46.800 --> 01:48.800]  fascist communist model.
[01:48.800 --> 01:53.760]  That's on the bottom, corporate fascist on the top, us in between it.
[01:53.760 --> 01:54.760]  And people like, is this real?
[01:54.760 --> 02:00.000]  Then, of course, later, it officially was done, and it was a real document.
[02:00.000 --> 02:03.040]  But Twitter and Facebook and YouTube would block the different medical doctors that were
[02:03.040 --> 02:06.240]  exposing it and speaking about it, but then they had press conferences with the Quebec
[02:06.240 --> 02:12.400]  ministers saying, we're building secret facilities for round two 2021 for the new variants.
[02:12.400 --> 02:13.400]  It's all scripted.
[02:13.400 --> 02:16.360]  And this is organized crime out in the open.
[02:16.360 --> 02:19.640]  He says it in French, but I played the clip five or six times here, and he says, and we're
[02:19.640 --> 02:23.000]  already arresting hundreds of people and holding them in secret facilities.
[02:23.000 --> 02:27.000]  And we're going to grab thousands.
[02:27.000 --> 02:32.240]  And so China is building these emergency centers, the US is building them, England, Germany.
[02:32.240 --> 02:33.880]  This is the excuse for martial law.
[02:33.880 --> 02:37.120]  This is the bureaucracy absorbing the people.
[02:37.120 --> 02:40.560]  This is absolutely pure criminal activity.
[02:40.560 --> 02:42.320]  And there's almost no senator standing up.
[02:42.320 --> 02:46.960]  There's almost no governor standing up because they know it's the takeover and they want
[02:46.960 --> 02:50.080]  to be in the new overclass.
[02:50.080 --> 02:52.400]  The Uber mention, they believe they can't defeat it.
[02:52.400 --> 02:58.280]  So almost everyone is getting on their knees to this insane criminal takeover.
[02:58.280 --> 03:03.960]  So I'm going to show you here in the stacks today, a wide spectrum analysis of all this
[03:03.960 --> 03:06.960]  in the first hour when we come back.
[03:06.960 --> 03:11.280]  And then I'm going to shift gears and get into the economic implosion end of it, the
[03:11.280 --> 03:19.400]  border implosion end of it with Peter Schiff of Europe, Pacific capital, we'll talk about
[03:19.400 --> 03:22.760]  the all time highs of silver and GameStop and all the rest of it.
[03:22.760 --> 03:26.200]  And then Robert Barnes, constitutional lawyers and working with Trump, he'll be joining us
[03:26.200 --> 03:30.440]  talking about the new legal team that Trump has and the impeachment trial that kicks off
[03:30.440 --> 03:34.240]  next Tuesday in the Senate.
[03:34.240 --> 03:36.920]  But it's all right here.
[03:36.920 --> 03:39.280]  And by the way, it's not hidden.
[03:39.280 --> 03:46.080]  Biden's spokesperson for COVID was on Meet the Prestus weekend saying this is a five-year
[03:46.080 --> 03:52.440]  lockdown coming and we're going to close everything except big box stores that are essential.
[03:52.440 --> 03:58.800]  So this is siege, the most ancient form of total war and it's global government and China's
[03:58.800 --> 03:59.800]  open for business.
[03:59.800 --> 04:13.680]  It's designed to transfer all of the all of the resources and jobs overseas.
[04:13.680 --> 04:16.120]  And the public's got to go into a conscious mode.
[04:16.120 --> 04:19.920]  Everybody gets really unconscious, just kind of accepts what's coming at them.
[04:19.920 --> 04:21.680]  Like I'm not mad at the crew.
[04:21.680 --> 04:22.680]  I love them to death.
[04:22.680 --> 04:27.600]  But I said, if my collar is ever sticking up, you got to tell me on air, open your eyes,
[04:27.600 --> 04:28.600]  look for problems.
[04:28.600 --> 04:30.880]  If I got a bugger hanging out of my nose, tell me.
[04:30.880 --> 04:31.880]  But they won't do it.
[04:31.880 --> 04:32.880]  They're good people.
[04:32.880 --> 04:33.880]  They're just in a trance.
[04:33.880 --> 04:34.880]  I call it.
[04:34.880 --> 04:35.880]  We're sticking straight up.
[04:35.880 --> 04:36.880]  See, I'm not mad at them.
[04:36.880 --> 04:37.880]  It's a teaching moment.
[04:37.880 --> 04:41.160]  The globalists are coming with deadly vaccines that don't work permanent lockdowns and everybody's
[04:41.160 --> 04:42.160]  just kind of taking it.
[04:42.160 --> 04:43.480]  They're just kind of taking it.
[04:43.480 --> 04:44.640]  You can't take it anymore.
[04:44.640 --> 04:46.240]  You got to get the conscious mode.
[04:46.240 --> 04:49.760]  See when you're not conscious, you're basically dying and you can be programmed.
[04:49.760 --> 04:52.120]  You must get into a conscious, clear mode.
[04:52.120 --> 05:03.200]  We're right back, stay with us.
[05:03.200 --> 05:04.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've studied history.
[05:04.880 --> 05:06.720]  I've interviewed all the experts.
[05:06.720 --> 05:08.800]  I have looked at every facet of this.
[05:08.800 --> 05:14.800]  And now, only days until the inauguration of the CHICOM agent, it's all coming into place.
[05:14.800 --> 05:16.920]  That's how they change the subject from election fraud.
[05:16.920 --> 05:19.320]  It's how they change the subject from Hunter's laptop.
[05:19.320 --> 05:25.760]  It's how they change the subject from Epstein and Obama and Al Qaeda and the New World Order.
[05:25.760 --> 05:31.160]  And now, use the already martial law in place for COVID-19, and that's what it is, to then
[05:31.160 --> 05:35.200]  be expanded and become political and become permanent.
[05:35.200 --> 05:36.480]  They train you to stay in your houses.
[05:36.480 --> 05:37.480]  They train you to be tracked.
[05:37.480 --> 05:41.280]  They train and do what you're told for nine, 10 months as training wheels, and now they
[05:41.280 --> 05:42.280]  launch the storm.
[05:42.280 --> 05:43.280]  The storm is here.
[05:43.280 --> 05:44.280]  The storm is here.
[05:44.280 --> 05:46.680]  It's a globalist storm.
[05:46.680 --> 05:48.280]  There's not going to be martial law for Trump.
[05:48.280 --> 05:50.920]  There's to be martial law for the globalist.
[05:50.920 --> 05:52.480]  They're trying to set you up.
[05:52.480 --> 05:54.520]  Don't be involved in violence.
[05:54.520 --> 05:57.920]  Expose the New World Order and expose the takeover with information.
[05:57.920 --> 06:24.760]  That's how we beat these people with truth.
[06:24.760 --> 06:34.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Monday, February 1st, the year is 2021.
[06:34.560 --> 06:40.000]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, and we are going into the world government.
[06:40.000 --> 06:48.520]  Okay, coming up, we're going to play a clip from Meet the Press of one of Biden's chief
[06:48.520 --> 06:54.520]  COVID advisors saying that permanent lockdown is coming.
[06:54.520 --> 06:58.920]  They're going to release the pressure to train you to submit when they put the handcuffs
[06:58.920 --> 06:59.920]  back on.
[06:59.920 --> 07:01.960]  But there'll come a point when the handcuffs never come off again.
[07:01.960 --> 07:05.560]  But this is all Pavlovian manipulation and learned helplessness is what you're being
[07:05.560 --> 07:06.560]  given.
[07:06.560 --> 07:11.240]  It has nothing to do with the environment, nothing to do with COVID-19, nothing to do
[07:11.240 --> 07:13.880]  with saving anybody.
[07:13.880 --> 07:16.400]  It's all about total power and control.
[07:16.400 --> 07:22.120]  COVID is a giant hoax, a synthetic virus that mimics the regular cold virus.
[07:22.120 --> 07:23.640]  They admit the vaccines don't work.
[07:23.640 --> 07:24.800]  They'll never work.
[07:24.800 --> 07:28.760]  Now they're saying you're going to need 15 vaccines a year for every new variant.
[07:28.760 --> 07:36.360]  It's just an impossible problem that can never be fixed that transfers all power and control
[07:36.360 --> 07:37.960]  over your life to them.
[07:37.960 --> 07:40.200]  And I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[07:40.200 --> 07:44.360]  Let's go ahead and zoom in right here for TV viewers, right here for me, please.
[07:44.360 --> 07:50.960]  And I'm going to just read you these headlines.
[07:50.960 --> 07:52.360]  Let's just read these headlines.
[07:52.360 --> 08:00.560]  Busted, CDC, inflated COVID numbers accused of violating federal law, national file.
[08:00.560 --> 08:04.880]  Medical tyranny, CDC announces all travelers will wear two masks, threats of arrest, and
[08:04.880 --> 08:08.320]  now they claim control over the highways and people driving in cars.
[08:08.320 --> 08:14.000]  The CDC says we have arrest authority, total power grab.
[08:14.000 --> 08:19.040]  This celebrates as Biden's CDC makes not wearing a mask on public transport, Uber, a federal
[08:19.040 --> 08:21.880]  crime.
[08:21.880 --> 08:24.720]  Chilling trend, a longer, deadlier pandemic.
[08:24.720 --> 08:29.920]  By the way, you can't have executive orders making things for the general public a crime.
[08:29.920 --> 08:32.560]  I'm just claiming interstate commerce over all the roads.
[08:32.560 --> 08:34.720]  I mean, this is just martial law.
[08:34.720 --> 08:38.240]  Chilling trend, a longer, deadlier pandemic.
[08:38.240 --> 08:39.880]  And it's a big article out of Axios.
[08:39.880 --> 08:46.760]  This is the one that's linked to the Meet the Press, where they say that you will never
[08:46.760 --> 08:53.320]  leave and that the lockdowns are coming for at least five years.
[08:53.320 --> 08:57.280]  Representative Stephen Lynch tests positive for COVID-19 weeks after he completed the
[08:57.280 --> 08:58.520]  two-shot round.
[08:58.520 --> 09:02.800]  Yeah, taking the vaccine says you're COVID positive.
[09:02.800 --> 09:03.800]  That's how it works.
[09:03.800 --> 09:05.280]  It's all total fraud, all lies.
[09:05.280 --> 09:09.280]  They now admit, oh, all these tests are fraudulent, they're almost all false positive.
[09:09.280 --> 09:14.160]  Now we're going to start anal swabbing, because China and Singapore do, and they have robots
[09:14.160 --> 09:16.240]  on the ground with weapons controlling us.
[09:16.240 --> 09:21.440]  Well, if China does it, we better do it immediately.
[09:21.440 --> 09:26.240]  New clinical trials raise fears that coronavirus is learning how to resist the vaccines.
[09:26.240 --> 09:28.560]  Oh, that's Yahoo News.
[09:28.560 --> 09:29.560]  Oh, my gosh.
[09:29.560 --> 09:33.800]  And oh, they have the guys out in the spacesuits.
[09:33.800 --> 09:38.720]  They have them with the containment centers all to do the Kabuki Theater to scare you.
[09:38.720 --> 09:42.120]  Oh, my gosh.
[09:42.120 --> 09:47.120]  COVID-19 tests now available in Oakland Airport vending machine to create even more hysteria
[09:47.120 --> 09:49.280]  and fear.
[09:49.280 --> 09:54.000]  Biden Health Advisor warns of virus variants, future lockdowns, and this is the one guys
[09:54.000 --> 09:57.440]  for you to go grab the Meet the Press video out of, please.
[09:57.440 --> 09:58.440]  Thank you.
[09:58.440 --> 10:07.560]  Biden Health Advisor warns of virus variants, future lockdowns, and says five years of lockdowns,
[10:07.560 --> 10:13.160]  including everything closed, but big corporations, total war, total victory.
[10:13.160 --> 10:17.000]  Dangerous new coronavirus strains may incubate in COVID-19 sickest, so they've got to be
[10:17.000 --> 10:22.840]  kept in secret camps away from everyone so they can be intubated and killed with enjoyment.
[10:22.840 --> 10:29.440]  And then whoever kills them gets $53,000 for the execution.
[10:29.440 --> 10:33.280]  Playing favorites, hospital boards and donors get COVID shots.
[10:33.280 --> 10:35.560]  Oh, everybody's got to have it.
[10:35.560 --> 10:36.560]  Only the elite get it.
[10:36.560 --> 10:39.040]  They need to rush out and get it right now.
[10:39.040 --> 10:40.480]  Oh, my gosh.
[10:40.480 --> 10:41.480]  Everybody wants it.
[10:41.480 --> 10:43.360]  It's like the Christmas toy that nobody can have.
[10:43.360 --> 10:47.400]  Everybody rushes out and tries to get, then it turns out in every case, big corporations
[10:47.400 --> 10:54.400]  will pose with actresses fighting over the new cabbage patch doll or whatever it is.
[10:54.400 --> 10:58.160]  And there's lines out the store, and it's all fake, just like they caught production
[10:58.160 --> 11:02.320]  companies with nurses and doctors dressed up in hazmat gear going in and out in New Jersey
[11:02.320 --> 11:07.080]  and Texas and New York to say that, oh, we're so full for COVID, oh, it's a disaster.
[11:07.080 --> 11:09.440]  It was all literal criminal theater.
[11:09.440 --> 11:13.320]  They got the Democrats ready to commit mass crime, these corporate people ready to commit
[11:13.320 --> 11:14.320]  mass crime.
[11:14.320 --> 11:17.160]  It's incredible.
[11:17.160 --> 11:19.840]  Vaccine skepticism lurks in town.
[11:19.840 --> 11:22.120]  Famous for syphilis study, AP.
[11:22.120 --> 11:25.160]  Okay, we told black people we were giving them a vaccine.
[11:25.160 --> 11:26.480]  We injected them with syphilis.
[11:26.480 --> 11:27.920]  We tracked them dying with syphilis.
[11:27.920 --> 11:29.400]  They gave it to hundreds of thousands of people.
[11:29.400 --> 11:34.120]  They also shot up poor white Appalachians with it as well, but it's okay because Tim
[11:34.120 --> 11:35.520]  cooks gay.
[11:35.520 --> 11:37.640]  He runs death camps in China.
[11:37.640 --> 11:38.640]  He's gay.
[11:38.640 --> 11:41.560]  And it's all right that he covers this up because he's gay.
[11:41.560 --> 11:43.480]  Vaccine skepticism lurks in town.
[11:43.480 --> 11:45.000]  Famous for syphilis study.
[11:45.000 --> 11:47.760]  And they say, I trust the white woman to give me the shot.
[11:47.760 --> 11:54.520]  Hey, the white lady didn't load up the mRNA death juice for you, lady, but it's like
[11:54.520 --> 11:57.920]  showing black nurses giving black people shots.
[11:57.920 --> 12:00.160]  Now they're like, oh, we trust the white people.
[12:00.160 --> 12:01.160]  Okay.
[12:01.160 --> 12:04.840]  She has no idea what's in the damn shot.
[12:04.840 --> 12:09.600]  Tech glitches, swamp websites in PQS vaccine distribution.
[12:09.600 --> 12:10.600]  Everybody has to have it.
[12:10.600 --> 12:14.240]  I mean, light up and get it.
[12:14.240 --> 12:17.040]  Everybody wants to win a lottery ticket.
[12:17.040 --> 12:21.640]  Everybody wants that magic thing like, oh, the mask is for me.
[12:21.640 --> 12:23.040]  I wear it over my face.
[12:23.040 --> 12:25.160]  It's my binky.
[12:25.160 --> 12:29.200]  It's my little blanket that you haul around behind you.
[12:29.200 --> 12:37.920]  And it's for you and you're a hero and you're so good.
[12:37.920 --> 12:38.920]  It's a mess.
[12:38.920 --> 12:43.800]  Biden's first 10 days dominated by vaccine mysteries.
[12:43.800 --> 12:44.800]  Where is it?
[12:44.800 --> 12:48.640]  There's 20 million dosages just missing somewhere, 20 million doses.
[12:48.640 --> 12:55.920]  Oh, meanwhile, a week after saying wear two masks, Fauci says it won't make a difference.
[12:55.920 --> 12:56.920]  Wow.
[12:56.920 --> 12:58.800]  But what would vitamin D, C and E do?
[12:58.800 --> 13:01.480]  Any virus will kill you if you don't have them, but they're called essential.
[13:01.480 --> 13:03.040]  You die without it.
[13:03.040 --> 13:05.920]  Viruses take over your cells because your cells don't have the building blocks to protect
[13:05.920 --> 13:06.920]  themselves.
[13:06.920 --> 13:10.320]  Like if you don't have water, you die of thirst in about two weeks.
[13:10.320 --> 13:11.320]  You don't have food.
[13:11.320 --> 13:14.880]  Hell, water, you die in about a week, but you don't have food, you die in about three
[13:14.880 --> 13:15.880]  weeks.
[13:15.880 --> 13:22.560]  Oh, California State Senator faces ridicule for bragging about wearing two masks.
[13:22.560 --> 13:24.920]  But hell, he had to be topped.
[13:24.920 --> 13:30.280]  When he and Fauci said that last week, within days, they were up to five masks, five masks.
[13:30.280 --> 13:35.760]  And Biden signed an executive order saying you've got to wear two masks or you're going
[13:35.760 --> 13:38.400]  to federal prison.
[13:38.400 --> 13:42.080]  What a kook criminal.
[13:42.080 --> 13:46.200]  French restaurant owners who open in defiance of lockdown on Monday will be punished as the
[13:46.200 --> 13:47.200]  economic minister.
[13:47.200 --> 13:51.720]  They'll be punished even more by going bankrupt if they don't.
[13:51.720 --> 13:57.760]  Anti-vax mob, the closed Dodger Stadium vaccination site sparks outrage.
[13:57.760 --> 13:59.880]  We've got video people saying, I want my shot.
[13:59.880 --> 14:00.880]  I'm a hero.
[14:00.880 --> 14:02.120]  Get me in there.
[14:02.120 --> 14:03.120]  All they did was protest.
[14:03.120 --> 14:06.920]  So the police panicked and like blocked the entrance of all the lemmings going in to get
[14:06.920 --> 14:12.520]  the deadly vaccine that doesn't protect them, that doesn't do anything except cause auto
[14:12.520 --> 14:17.840]  immune disorders, cancer, and of course, long lingering horrible diseases and death.
[14:17.840 --> 14:29.680]  Oh, it just goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on.
[14:29.680 --> 14:31.680]  But here's where it gets really interesting.
[14:31.680 --> 14:41.560]  China denying entry to people who took Pfizer Moderna vaccines isn't that interesting saying
[14:41.560 --> 14:45.320]  that it can actually spread a deadly variant of a virus.
[14:45.320 --> 14:46.320]  Who knows?
[14:46.320 --> 14:49.920]  I mean, we don't know why they've got whole genomes of dead kids in them and why they
[14:49.920 --> 14:54.920]  got jellyfish, colony creature genes in them, whole genomes.
[14:54.920 --> 14:57.320]  I mean, top scientists, look at this, and they go, this looks like some kind of damn
[14:57.320 --> 15:03.680]  weapon and Bill Gates just smile and go, God, I want to depopulate your ass and man, I want
[15:03.680 --> 15:08.880]  to kill old people and they're all dying.
[15:08.880 --> 15:09.880]  Large percentages.
[15:09.880 --> 15:13.480]  Everybody I talked to that runs nursing homes or works in them says they give those shots
[15:13.480 --> 15:18.520]  and upwards of three or four percent are dead within days and it's just no big deal because
[15:18.520 --> 15:19.920]  all the young are locked out.
[15:19.920 --> 15:23.760]  Nobody a year ends allowed to see their parents and they're locked up in there and Bill Gates
[15:23.760 --> 15:27.560]  is their doctor and he gives them that shot and all the rest of them can't even get out
[15:27.560 --> 15:31.320]  of bed anymore and they'll be dead in a few months probably, but they won't matter because
[15:31.320 --> 15:34.520]  we'll say they died of COVID.
[15:34.520 --> 15:42.560]  Yes, is it liberal, but let's get into the five year lockdown.
[15:42.560 --> 15:46.120]  He's going to take off the lockdown for a little while and then slam it shut on you
[15:46.120 --> 15:51.360]  for permanent martial law and then the Clinton Foundation runs the contact tracers, five million
[15:51.360 --> 15:58.440]  of them are coming to your house and they're coming armed with weapons and building camps.
[15:58.440 --> 16:02.800]  I love the Patriot Blend Wake Up America coffee.
[16:02.800 --> 16:04.120]  I just love it.
[16:04.120 --> 16:05.680]  I can't get enough of it.
[16:05.680 --> 16:08.760]  We've got a fresh brew right now.
[16:08.760 --> 16:09.960]  That's what fills my mug.
[16:09.960 --> 16:11.120]  That's what fills my belly.
[16:11.120 --> 16:12.680]  That's what fills my soul.
[16:12.680 --> 16:14.720]  Wake Up America Patriot Blend coffee folks.
[16:14.720 --> 16:19.400]  We have had this coffee for years at infowarstore.com years.
[16:19.400 --> 16:21.040]  Never raised the price.
[16:21.040 --> 16:24.880]  The Wake Up America blend, the best coffee, the crew here loves it.
[16:24.880 --> 16:25.880]  We drink it every day.
[16:25.880 --> 16:31.000]  And of course, that's just one of the great ways you can support info wars here.
[16:31.000 --> 16:33.120]  Everybody drinks coffee or just about everybody.
[16:33.120 --> 16:37.880]  Why not support info wars and keep the coffee supply at your house with the Wake Up America
[16:37.880 --> 16:38.880]  Patriot Blend?
[16:38.880 --> 16:40.320]  Of course, read all the great reviews.
[16:40.320 --> 16:44.240]  Pretty much perfect review there 4.9 star when you have thousands of reviews.
[16:44.240 --> 16:48.280]  It's impossible to have a perfect review unless literally everybody gives it five stars.
[16:48.280 --> 16:51.280]  So I mean, if you have 4.9, that's pretty much everybody who gives it a five star except
[16:51.280 --> 16:52.280]  maybe one or two people.
[16:52.280 --> 16:58.280]  Patriot Blend 100% organic coffee only available at infowarsstore.com.
[16:58.280 --> 17:04.680]  We have the technocrats are controlling the food supply, secure your own safe source of
[17:04.680 --> 17:05.680]  food supply sale.
[17:05.680 --> 17:09.080]  It's the new prices in 2021, but it's the lowest price for high quality food.
[17:09.080 --> 17:11.600]  You're going to find at infowarsstore.com.
[17:11.600 --> 17:15.600]  The subsection is prepared with alex.com and as all these globalists do this and as
[17:15.600 --> 17:20.440]  they hoard the food and as they prepare, you need to understand that you need 25 year foods
[17:20.440 --> 17:24.720]  to rely on the last 25 years, one month, three months, six months, one year supplies and
[17:24.720 --> 17:28.800]  it's the highest quality you're going to find and it's just good to have that check box taken
[17:28.800 --> 17:32.720]  care of and you know you're getting good food at a very good price and you know that a small
[17:32.720 --> 17:36.960]  percentage of it because there's not much profit in this goes to us to fund our operation.
[17:36.960 --> 17:39.960]  So prepare with alex.com or infowarsstore.com.
[17:39.960 --> 17:43.720]  You can find the preparedness section there, water filtration, air filtration.
[17:43.720 --> 17:47.440]  It's all there, the technocrats are getting ready to bring in all the forced GMO and more.
[17:47.440 --> 17:48.840]  It's time to start getting prepared.
[17:48.840 --> 17:50.080]  It starts with self defense.
[17:50.080 --> 17:51.480]  It starts with being prepared.
[17:51.480 --> 17:52.480]  It starts with horrible food.
[17:52.480 --> 17:55.240]  It starts with digging in with a long globalist fight.
[17:55.240 --> 18:01.600]  You'll win in the end.
[18:01.600 --> 18:14.480]  You're listening to the alex jones show.
[18:14.480 --> 18:23.320]  The answer to 1984 is seven answer to 1984 is 1776.
[18:23.320 --> 18:26.280]  You're listening to the alex jones show.
[18:26.280 --> 18:29.000]  Yeah, my wife asked me last night.
[18:29.000 --> 18:33.360]  She said, you're not usually up at midnight reading and bouncing off the walls.
[18:33.360 --> 18:34.560]  She goes, what is going on with you?
[18:34.560 --> 18:37.960]  And I just said, everything we thought about the globalist was accurate.
[18:37.960 --> 18:42.280]  It's dead on except it's worse than I thought and I just I'm living in a science fiction
[18:42.280 --> 18:48.640]  dystopia movie and I just can't sit here in a comfortable position and go along with this.
[18:48.640 --> 18:55.560]  I mean, this is a diabolical scientific criminal corporate medical takeover in their own words
[18:55.560 --> 19:00.120]  Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates write books saying this virus isn't even a threat.
[19:00.120 --> 19:04.040]  We're using this to bring in a global government and to save the earth by cutting your carbon
[19:04.040 --> 19:09.920]  footprint and making you poor and then my own governor is going along with it.
[19:09.920 --> 19:13.000]  And he knows full well that we never come out of it.
[19:13.000 --> 19:15.960]  First they told you 15 days and they told you two months and they told you six months
[19:15.960 --> 19:18.840]  and they told you a year that they told you two years and now they're starting to come
[19:18.840 --> 19:22.800]  out and say five years.
[19:22.800 --> 19:25.680]  It'll never end, folks.
[19:25.680 --> 19:30.720]  They are habituating everyone and then they admit the vaccines don't protect you.
[19:30.720 --> 19:34.040]  And I'm going to cover that in a moment, but there's good news.
[19:34.040 --> 19:36.080]  Why did Merck stop their vaccine program?
[19:36.080 --> 19:38.520]  Why did the Australian government stop their vaccine program?
[19:38.520 --> 19:41.280]  Why did Macron announced Friday with almost no coverage?
[19:41.280 --> 19:50.920]  The French dictator does the yellow vest rebellions that quote the vaccine is almost useless, almost
[19:50.920 --> 19:53.960]  completely ineffective.
[19:53.960 --> 19:56.640]  And notice who he talked about.
[19:56.640 --> 20:03.400]  He said above 65 because the British government says do not take it above 75 mRNA vaccine.
[20:03.400 --> 20:05.640]  It will kill you.
[20:05.640 --> 20:09.480]  They started it almost two months ago, the first country and the military implemented
[20:09.480 --> 20:11.680]  it and the military came out and said this is insane.
[20:11.680 --> 20:13.080]  Their own troops wouldn't do it.
[20:13.080 --> 20:16.880]  They own medical doctors and an army, so this is killing people.
[20:16.880 --> 20:17.880]  Three groups shouldn't take it.
[20:17.880 --> 20:19.640]  I know I, folks, I could cover a thousand articles.
[20:19.640 --> 20:21.240]  I'm going to just keep saying this every second.
[20:21.240 --> 20:22.680]  We're saving lives here.
[20:22.680 --> 20:24.480]  If you're above 75, don't take it.
[20:24.480 --> 20:25.960]  If you're under 16, don't take it.
[20:25.960 --> 20:27.400]  And if you're pregnant, don't take it.
[20:27.400 --> 20:33.480]  But see, that's in the advisory, so they're covered, but that's the fine print.
[20:33.480 --> 20:34.600]  I watched the news.
[20:34.600 --> 20:38.600]  I watched the California footage of literally tens of thousands of cars pulled up at a sports
[20:38.600 --> 20:45.440]  stadium to get their shots begging for it, and it was women and children and old people.
[20:45.440 --> 20:48.320]  And some are dying the day they get it.
[20:48.320 --> 20:51.480]  It's in the news.
[20:51.480 --> 20:58.440]  So this is the twilight zone level of people lining up, going to be hurt.
[20:58.440 --> 21:01.520]  And they admit now, when they go, oh, it was 96% effective.
[21:01.520 --> 21:02.520]  Now it's 50% effective.
[21:02.520 --> 21:03.840]  No, it's 20%.
[21:03.840 --> 21:04.840]  It's not.
[21:04.840 --> 21:05.840]  It's all alive.
[21:05.840 --> 21:06.840]  They didn't do long-term trials.
[21:06.840 --> 21:07.840]  They didn't do trials.
[21:07.840 --> 21:13.120]  When they started giving it to people, they started killing them.
[21:13.120 --> 21:17.240]  So why is Macron saying they may just suspend the vaccine program and just open things up
[21:17.240 --> 21:20.400]  because he realizes the public's not going to buy this?
[21:20.400 --> 21:24.080]  This is a car baby that gets you.
[21:24.080 --> 21:25.960]  And then, oh, sorry, two shots don't work.
[21:25.960 --> 21:26.960]  Now it's five shots.
[21:26.960 --> 21:29.560]  Well, Gates loves to say stuff first.
[21:29.560 --> 21:34.320]  Gates said eight months ago you're going to get five shots a year for COVID and COVID variants.
[21:34.320 --> 21:38.880]  It's a corporate plan.
[21:38.880 --> 21:41.200]  But why is Macron stopping it?
[21:41.200 --> 21:48.720]  Why is Australia saying, OK, the vaccine and canceling 54 million doses they made?
[21:48.720 --> 21:53.560]  Because it's hurting and killing people, and they're like, my God, this is so obvious.
[21:53.560 --> 21:54.640]  What are we doing?
[21:54.640 --> 21:55.640]  They're testing.
[21:55.640 --> 21:57.200]  Can they get away with killing us?
[21:57.200 --> 22:01.200]  Remember, Bill Gates runs the whole big eugenics operation on record.
[22:01.200 --> 22:04.000]  He was on Bill Maher talking about it.
[22:04.000 --> 22:07.440]  He's been on lawyers talking about it.
[22:07.440 --> 22:08.440]  I made films about it.
[22:08.440 --> 22:11.000]  I made an in-game about it 13, 14 years ago.
[22:11.000 --> 22:12.400]  This is not a game.
[22:12.400 --> 22:18.040]  So next segment, I'll show you all the statements, the quotes, and the incredible information
[22:18.040 --> 22:19.040]  that I just began to lay out.
[22:19.040 --> 22:21.600]  I'll actually show you where they say it, where they do it.
[22:21.600 --> 22:23.840]  But first, let me just talk about this.
[22:23.840 --> 22:27.040]  Notice the censorship that if medical doctors and nurses and scientists and the heads of
[22:27.040 --> 22:32.400]  hospitals come out and say, hey, if you give somebody inhalable steroids, they're better
[22:32.400 --> 22:34.120]  in one hour.
[22:34.120 --> 22:36.600]  It's an autoimmune response.
[22:36.600 --> 22:42.120]  Or, hey, I'm the head of the EU Commission, Wolfgang Wodard.
[22:42.120 --> 22:45.600]  We think this will cause an autoimmune response and actually kill you when you come in contact
[22:45.600 --> 22:47.880]  with a regular cold virus.
[22:47.880 --> 22:49.600]  And what does Google and Facebook and Twitter do?
[22:49.600 --> 22:56.600]  They block EU advisory commission reports, just like they block medical doctors in Congress
[22:56.600 --> 23:02.800]  and scientists and computer scientists in Congress that presented evidence of fraud.
[23:02.800 --> 23:09.000]  Now, days and days, hundreds of clips that we know of have been taken down of computer
[23:09.000 --> 23:15.480]  scientists and inventors and MIT top scientists and Stanford top scientists and inventors
[23:15.480 --> 23:23.480]  of QR code and top engineers showing the fraud, and it gets deleted.
[23:23.480 --> 23:30.480]  So we have a professional class that's actually still being professional by and large.
[23:30.480 --> 23:34.520]  Every doctor I talk to, almost every nurse I talk to knows it's all a fraud and a giant
[23:34.520 --> 23:37.880]  scam, and then all you need is therapeutics, and then it's just they're creating a fear
[23:37.880 --> 23:41.360]  over the common cold and that you can never have a vaccine for the common cold.
[23:41.360 --> 23:47.300]  Remember 11 months ago, I had, in fact, let's get him on this week, I had a great patriot
[23:47.300 --> 23:52.600]  on Dr. Francis Boyle, the author of the U.S. Biological Weapons Law, co-author of the UN
[23:52.600 --> 23:59.320]  World Government Law on Bio Weapons, and he said, you can't have a vaccine for the common
[23:59.320 --> 24:01.600]  cold of this virus, no one's ever been able to make it.
[24:01.600 --> 24:07.440]  He cited the papers, much less COVID, that's five different viruses mixed together, but
[24:07.440 --> 24:10.800]  based on a coronavirus, a cold virus.
[24:10.800 --> 24:13.800]  You think about that long and hard.
[24:13.800 --> 24:18.480]  We knew this 11 months ago, we're on record saying, I have zero hedge articles from 12
[24:18.480 --> 24:24.000]  months ago with top scientists saying, this vaccine will say that you have HIV, it is
[24:24.000 --> 24:29.280]  a copy of the virus, this virus has HIV delivering in it, and Australia had to suspend it because
[24:29.280 --> 24:33.660]  it does a false positive for HIV.
[24:33.660 --> 24:38.960]  This is a giant evil plan, walking us down, consolidating control, tracking everything
[24:38.960 --> 24:43.120]  we do, bankrupting us, getting rid of cash, bringing in world government, making us cover
[24:43.120 --> 24:48.960]  our faces in a cult, and making these globalists fabulously wealthy and then not to mention
[24:48.960 --> 25:00.840]  whatever the vaccine does to you, absolutely insane, absolutely crazy over the top nuts.
[25:00.840 --> 25:04.560]  And we told you all first, all right, I'm going to go to break, come back and lay all
[25:04.560 --> 25:05.560]  this out.
[25:05.560 --> 25:08.320]  Let me just briefly tell you about the new sale.
[25:08.320 --> 25:11.040]  It's a limited sale because we've almost sold out of everything, but these are some
[25:11.040 --> 25:16.480]  of our best sellers that are still around, DNA force plus selling out fast, super high
[25:16.480 --> 25:20.840]  end, PQQ, CoQ10, everything else to clean out your cells, actually make your telomeres
[25:20.840 --> 25:21.840]  last longer.
[25:21.840 --> 25:26.840]  It's got so much for your body, this is anybody that can afford this because it's expensive
[25:26.840 --> 25:30.720]  for us, it's a very expensive product, they sell the similar thing for 300 bucks, four
[25:30.720 --> 25:35.440]  or five times the amount at medical facilities, it's non-prescription, but they have doctors
[25:35.440 --> 25:38.640]  selling basically the same formula for three, four, five times.
[25:38.640 --> 25:43.360]  DNA force plus is so good, it's not synthetic, it's the real deal, synthetic versions are

[26:51.760 --> 26:55.480]  right now, we've got some news on that as well, coming up, they're openly calling for
[26:55.480 --> 27:25.440]  foxes, we take them off the air, it's to get in.
[27:25.440 --> 27:31.880]  I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States
[27:31.880 --> 27:38.080]  against all enemies, foreign and domestic, that I will bear true faith and allegiance
[27:38.080 --> 27:44.520]  to the same, that I take this obligation freely without any mental reservation or purpose
[27:44.520 --> 27:51.480]  of evasion, and that I will well and faithfully discharge my duties as best as I can, so help
[27:51.480 --> 27:52.480]  me God.
[27:52.480 --> 28:21.440]  That's exactly what all this overblown COVID-19 garbage is, you see the headlines from CNN,
[28:21.440 --> 28:25.760]  ABC News, doctors say it's worse than they ever thought, COVID more dumbest thing they
[28:25.760 --> 28:31.160]  could ever imagine, they told us that two and a half million people would be dead just
[28:31.160 --> 28:37.040]  eight months ago, within three months, okay, it's a quarter million, if you count all of
[28:37.040 --> 28:41.680]  the people that died of other things, we're talking 96% had comorbidity, these are real
[28:41.680 --> 28:46.480]  numbers, these are real facts, this is the chicken little event, we all run our houses,
[28:46.480 --> 28:50.000]  never come out, they're taught we're not essential, all the big box stores in Amazon
[28:50.000 --> 28:56.040]  take over the planet, you could stand up against it, this is slavery, it is not something you
[28:56.040 --> 28:59.720]  could put up with and survive.
[28:59.720 --> 29:04.160]  President Trump won in a landslide on November 3rd, but the globalists weren't going to let
[29:04.160 --> 29:10.080]  that happen, they had to have some way to repudiate the populist movement emanating
[29:10.080 --> 29:15.920]  from the United States that spread across the world from the UK to Brazil, they were
[29:15.920 --> 29:19.840]  desperate, they admitted their own publications, they didn't know what to do.
[29:19.840 --> 29:25.400]  And so they put out 80 million fake ballots, violated state law, and stole it better than
[29:25.400 --> 29:29.240]  dollars, and now they're coming after the president, they're coming after you, they're
[29:29.240 --> 29:33.360]  coming after me, they're shutting everybody off, the internet, they're trying to totally
[29:33.360 --> 29:38.640]  censor us, and that's why M4 Wars is still in the fight because we knew this was coming,
[29:38.640 --> 29:43.440]  we told you this was coming, we were the first main target that we're still on air, at m4wars.com
[29:43.440 --> 29:47.680]  and doiswars.com and band on video, but without your word of mouth and without your prayer
[29:47.680 --> 29:51.560]  and without your financial support, we can't stay on air, so while you still can, go to

[29:56.120 --> 29:59.280]  at m4wars.com.
[29:59.280 --> 30:08.800]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy, and overall wellness.
[30:08.800 --> 30:16.560]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date, super male vitality, specifically
[30:16.560 --> 30:23.600]  designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality
[30:23.600 --> 30:24.600]  in males.
[30:24.600 --> 30:30.560]  Now look, this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses, and it contains
[30:30.560 --> 30:39.440]  no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives, yes, we're talking about ancient wisdom combined
[30:39.440 --> 30:45.280]  with modern technology, working together in perfect synchronicity to help you get the
[30:45.280 --> 30:51.200]  most out of this herb packed formula, so what are you waiting for, go to the m4wars store,
[30:51.200 --> 31:01.560]  never been a better time than right now, super male vitality at m4wars.com.
[31:01.560 --> 31:20.840]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[31:31.560 --> 31:41.280]  Look, what's happening is very, very simple.
[31:41.280 --> 31:46.760]  History is repeating itself, but in a high tech, futuristic way.
[31:46.760 --> 31:58.440]  We're not in 1965, we're not in 1974, we're not in 1982, or 1997, or 2000, or 2015, we're
[31:58.440 --> 32:03.520]  in 2021.
[32:03.520 --> 32:07.600]  And the globalists have decided you don't get the Jetsons, you don't get life extension,
[32:07.600 --> 32:18.720]  you don't get all the goodies and the jet packs, you get to be phased out, put in a coffin
[32:18.720 --> 32:24.840]  apartment, brainwashed, atomized, made to be totally alone and depressed, and then finally
[32:24.840 --> 32:29.960]  you sign a form and an agreement to be able to travel to the Caribbean and be able to
[32:29.960 --> 32:38.200]  skydive and be able to take all the drugs you want for one year and then you will arrive
[32:38.200 --> 32:42.800]  at a reclamation center where you will go in and be drugged up and watch a beautiful
[32:42.800 --> 32:47.520]  film of your choice and killed.
[32:47.520 --> 32:49.680]  And that is their official plan.
[32:49.680 --> 32:53.240]  They pre-programmed it in all the Hollywood movies and now they're actually proposing
[32:53.240 --> 33:00.720]  that you will, again, be given credits, free pass, want to wear a mask, confiding where
[33:00.720 --> 33:03.200]  you want for one year.
[33:03.200 --> 33:07.160]  If you agree to have your sons sterilized and their testicles chopped off, you'll get even
[33:07.160 --> 33:10.960]  more, maybe three years of partying.
[33:10.960 --> 33:15.600]  And that's what the social credit score is and that's why they're positioning men that
[33:15.600 --> 33:19.400]  have had their testicles removed as the leaders of all the corporations and all the groups
[33:19.400 --> 33:20.760]  that satanic inversion.
[33:20.760 --> 33:25.760]  Men aren't going to be fathers, men will then pose as women as the guardians and lead us
[33:25.760 --> 33:28.400]  into death as you discuss.
[33:28.400 --> 33:33.720]  That all comes out of the transhumanist movement because it will accept men in women's bathrooms
[33:33.720 --> 33:40.080]  and men playing women in football and basketball and wrestling and boxing, but will accept
[33:40.080 --> 33:43.360]  cyborgs walking around, will accept human clones.
[33:43.360 --> 33:44.360]  That's all this is.
[33:44.360 --> 33:46.640]  As mad scientists want to play God, they want to be able to do whatever they want, whatever
[33:46.640 --> 33:50.640]  they want, and they're setting the precedent right up front that you're not essential,
[33:50.640 --> 33:54.440]  you're dirty, you're bad, you wear a face diaper over that ugly face, you cover that
[33:54.440 --> 33:59.160]  dirty, ugly thing, and we'll tell you on your little smartphone where you can go and
[33:59.160 --> 34:05.520]  where you can do, and that's the end of it.
[34:05.520 --> 34:12.960]  And by Pavlovian rewards, they teach you how avant-garde and cool it is to live in a coffin
[34:12.960 --> 34:13.960]  apartment.
[34:13.960 --> 34:18.280]  They teach you how avant-garde it is to sit there on Twitter and Facebook and lie about
[34:18.280 --> 34:21.880]  patriots and in screech and then have your tweets promoted, which doesn't even make
[34:21.880 --> 34:34.280]  you any money or even support you, but it feels good so you've been enslaved to dopamine.
[34:34.280 --> 34:39.320]  With all the history of secret experimentation, all the history of vaccines having Trojan
[34:39.320 --> 34:44.320]  horses and herding people and the very people running the global vaccine program saying
[34:44.320 --> 34:50.600]  they want the power to put in your body what they want, when they want to sterilize you.
[34:50.600 --> 34:56.120]  Maybe a hundred people go and protest in Southern California at the giant sports stadium where
[34:56.120 --> 35:05.840]  people out of thousands are lined up to take this deadly gene therapy system, and the media
[35:05.840 --> 35:10.480]  calls them terrorists and says they should be arrested.
[35:10.480 --> 35:15.720]  Look at them, and the cops are smart, they didn't even block the road going in, but the
[35:15.720 --> 35:20.880]  police then, oh, shut it all down so they could say that they were terrorists and they
[35:20.880 --> 35:21.880]  were bad.
[35:21.880 --> 35:26.600]  There are the police, direct them over, they don't block the traffic, but the police go
[35:26.600 --> 35:29.960]  ahead and close it down and then blame them.
[35:29.960 --> 35:39.200]  So they can say, oh, you kept this from our life saving stuff, and then there's all the
[35:39.200 --> 35:42.640]  vaccine reactions and all the deaths, and well, it doesn't matter, it's for the greater
[35:42.640 --> 35:43.640]  good.
[35:43.640 --> 35:51.000]  Be a hero like Hank Aaron, get your second shot and have a convulsion and go to Jesus.
[35:51.000 --> 35:58.760]  Just die, just Klaus Schwab needs the earth, Jean-Claude Junker needs the earth, Ted Turner
[35:58.760 --> 36:08.720]  needs the earth, Bill Gates needs the earth, so make way, make way, my slaves.
[36:08.720 --> 36:17.760]  And if you go to theheadlineandinfowars.com, there it is, Joe Biden is planning a five
[36:17.760 --> 36:23.160]  year lockdown, and I have the quotes right here, breaking documents Joe Biden planning
[36:23.160 --> 36:26.200]  five year lockdown.
[36:26.200 --> 36:30.400]  We are witnessing a global corporate takeover designed to merge the United States with the
[36:30.400 --> 36:34.160]  European Union and communist China under the United Nations.
[36:34.160 --> 36:40.560]  Peter Schiff joins the show to reveal explosive news about the economy, Robert Barnes breaks
[36:40.560 --> 36:49.120]  down the unconstitutionality of the Trump impeachment trial coming up live today.
[36:49.120 --> 36:54.080]  So let's just go back into some of the headlines, I've probably covered 40 or 50 articles, I've
[36:54.080 --> 37:01.160]  got another 100 here, most of them even mainstream, fine print telling you what they're doing.
[37:01.160 --> 37:07.640]  Look at this one, first U.S. pharma giant to abandon COVID vaccine efforts, that happened
[37:07.640 --> 37:12.000]  last week, they've already buried the fact that they said there's no way to have a vaccine
[37:12.000 --> 37:15.600]  that actually protects you, there's too many mutations, this is all a fraud, you should
[37:15.600 --> 37:19.040]  just get it and get over it and take therapeutics.
[37:19.040 --> 37:25.080]  What an incredible thing, you think that would be done, done, done, done, all over every channel,
[37:25.080 --> 37:26.080]  but no, no, no.
[37:26.080 --> 37:31.240]  That's what scientists said, oh, 99% take hydroxychloroquine, they're fine, well yeah,
[37:31.240 --> 37:35.960]  because it pushes zinc into the cells, nope, can't say that, only the U.N. can say what
[37:35.960 --> 37:39.280]  a therapeutic is.
[37:39.280 --> 37:44.240]  And again, report China denying entry to people who took Pfizer Moderna vaccines, China reportedly
[37:44.240 --> 37:49.160]  denying entry of individuals who have taken the Pfizer Moderna vaccines and it goes on
[37:49.160 --> 37:52.920]  and breaks it all down.
[37:52.920 --> 37:57.160]  And again, our show yesterday was Sunday Live, France says COVID vaccine is not work, collapsing
[37:57.160 --> 37:58.160]  the hoax.
[37:58.160 --> 38:02.760]  I've actually got the articles here that I'll go over for you.
[38:02.760 --> 38:09.760]  The other rebellion, oh see, they're now tying an MSN, literally MSN.com, to what happened
[38:09.760 --> 38:14.800]  at the Capitol, which was at most a riot with four citizens being killed, a cop having
[38:14.800 --> 38:20.120]  a heart attack days later, into an insurrection, well now they're saying game stop is an insurrection
[38:20.120 --> 38:26.000]  anti-terrorism and now they're saying businesses that have been closed for 10 months in Michigan
[38:26.000 --> 38:34.360]  that are going bankrupt that they're reopening, they're still wearing their face diapers, well
[38:34.360 --> 38:39.960]  that's terrorism too, the other rebellion, oh no, dozens of Michigan restaurants defy
[38:39.960 --> 38:47.200]  state coronavirus order, oh my gosh, they've got to be arrested, it goes into the article.
[38:47.200 --> 38:52.360]  Over the old video, Como said a few months ago, who cares, Como insists it doesn't matter
[38:52.360 --> 38:57.960]  where 4,000 hidden nursing home desktops place, but that was months ago, now it's 12,000,
[38:57.960 --> 39:04.160]  12,000, he said who cares, it's all about making you feel helpless, oh and the Orthodox
[39:04.160 --> 39:09.040]  Jews, I've got all this video of them being shot, beat up, pepper sprayed and taken to
[39:09.040 --> 39:19.120]  jail because they will not violate Leviticus, which is the law of Moses and take anyone
[39:19.120 --> 39:24.360]  else's seed, meaning blood, that's kind of smart isn't it, like Leviticus says don't
[39:24.360 --> 39:30.080]  eat oysters, I mean back then especially eat oysters, they'd kill you before they were
[39:30.080 --> 39:34.360]  cooked or whatever, I mean just come on, hey don't take somebody's blood into your body
[39:34.360 --> 39:37.400]  and don't take somebody's seed into your body and so because they're not going to take the
[39:37.400 --> 39:42.520]  shot just like in New York and just like here, they're going to jail and CNN is very, very
[39:42.520 --> 39:47.640]  excited about it and that is again, Jews being pepper sprayed and they've even got videos
[39:47.640 --> 39:53.360]  of them being shot and shot at by the Israeli forces because they will not take into their
[39:53.360 --> 40:00.360]  body that special loving Jews, they will not be raped properly, China is trying to collect
[40:00.360 --> 40:05.960]  Americans DNA and more former U.S. intel official says, this is all over the news, this article
[40:05.960 --> 40:09.560]  is from AmericanMilitaryNews.com and it turns out that they're involved in a lot of medical
[40:09.560 --> 40:15.280]  companies and DNA companies getting your DNA, so make sure it's not a Chinese company when
[40:15.280 --> 40:19.080]  you take that anal swab, which China has announced we must take and our media is already saying
[40:19.080 --> 40:25.280]  China is the boss and the U.N., we will now take anal swabs, China plans to switch to
[40:25.280 --> 40:29.960]  anal swab coronavirus testing, it says it's more accurate, U.S. follow suit, anal swabs
[40:29.960 --> 40:35.280]  now at the airport, they're actually setting up anal swab checkpoints, I'm not kidding,
[40:35.280 --> 40:38.960]  your camera, you go on yourself and stick it in your rear end, you watch a video, at
[40:38.960 --> 40:42.400]  the U.S. airports, they're getting them ready, I showed it yesterday, and you go in and stick
[40:42.400 --> 40:47.720]  a big long swab up your ass and that's what they do, so there you go, sorry, I got more
[40:47.720 --> 40:51.920]  for you when they come back where I should show you the articles in different countries
[40:51.920 --> 40:57.760]  whether it's saying the vaccine doesn't work, we'll be right back to stay with us.
[40:57.760 --> 41:02.520]  Mountain Patriot in Colorado, thank you for holding, how are you doing Alex, man I'm just
[41:02.520 --> 41:05.400]  working as hard as I can, we're in such a critical time, brother how are you?
[41:05.400 --> 41:10.960]  I love you man, I want to make a quick plug, that DNA force, I love it, I've been using
[41:10.960 --> 41:15.080]  it for quite a while and I just went, looked at the ingredients again the other day and
[41:15.080 --> 41:21.880]  I see that it contains quercetin, which according to some published studies that Dr. Merkala
[41:21.880 --> 41:29.840]  has cited, is an ionophore similar to hydroxychloroquine and it helps channel the zinc into the cells
[41:29.840 --> 41:36.000]  so people might want to take a look at that, all I know is with DNA force we went out and
[41:36.000 --> 41:41.080]  looked at these high end products that they sell through doctor clinics that aren't prescription
[41:41.080 --> 41:44.480]  but the doctor sells like 300 bucks a bottle because there's a lot of expensive product
[41:44.480 --> 41:48.880]  and it's really only cost them like 50 bucks and so we basically cloned two different top
[41:48.880 --> 41:57.160]  brands together and that's what produced this so thanks, thanks for the plug.
[41:57.160 --> 42:01.360]  The Pope came out yesterday and announced a global government corporate alliance to
[42:01.360 --> 42:06.240]  redistribute wealth and create a planetary universal income which of course the United
[42:06.240 --> 42:10.040]  Nations and global corporations will control through the apps on your phone and finally
[42:10.040 --> 42:11.240]  a chip under your skin.
[42:11.240 --> 42:17.160]  It's all now completely official, part of the UN great reset of the Davos Group and
[42:17.160 --> 42:21.960]  Cloud Schwab, all officially written about in hundreds of books by Schwab and Rockefeller
[42:21.960 --> 42:27.040]  Foundation all the rest of them, a 10 to 21, a 10 to 30, it's here and only gets worse
[42:27.040 --> 42:33.720]  like being fed into a wood chipper or a meat grinder until you reject it all and the rejection
[42:33.720 --> 42:39.400]  starts with realizing it's spiritual battle, diverse, evil and stopping abortion.
[42:39.400 --> 42:44.840]  We must start valuing human life again, we must start saying that we are not expendable,
[42:44.840 --> 42:51.520]  that we are not disposable, that we are essential, until we do that we are all slaves, we must
[42:51.520 --> 42:58.520]  stand up and declare our basic God-given human rights now.
[43:21.520 --> 43:29.720]  That's why every month we launch a new URL before they ban it, but Soros and Bill Gates
[43:29.720 --> 43:38.640]  and the Globless are on our tail, but the new website is the Resistance.Video, the Resistance.Video.
[43:38.640 --> 43:43.480]  They're trying to block us because the truth is powerful and can defeat them, so the new
[43:43.480 --> 43:48.280]  URL that links right to banned.video and all of our videos and all of our documentaries
[43:48.280 --> 43:53.280]  and all of the special reports and all of the suppressed information is at theresistance.video.
[43:53.280 --> 43:58.640]  Share the link, theresistance.video, theresistance.video.
[43:58.640 --> 44:02.600]  I've got some bad news, our best-selling vitamin mineral fusion has sold out because
[44:02.600 --> 44:06.600]  people understand in these stressful times it's now more important than ever to boost
[44:06.600 --> 44:07.760]  your body's natural defenses.
[44:07.760 --> 44:14.680]  But here's the good news, turmeric acts in very similar ways and is so good for inflammation,
[44:14.680 --> 44:18.680]  so good for your immune system, and we've got two great turmeric formulas.
[44:18.680 --> 44:24.480]  One is body's ultimate turmeric formula that is a dried turmeric extract, 95% humanoid.
[44:24.480 --> 44:25.480]  People love it.
[44:25.480 --> 44:26.480]  That's selling out.
[44:26.480 --> 44:32.040]  Despite that, it's still discounted at m4warstore.com, and then also selling out this week is our
[44:32.040 --> 44:36.160]  liquid turmeric extract, it's called liquid turmeric extract.
[44:36.160 --> 44:38.640]  People really love it, it's extremely strong as well.
[44:38.640 --> 44:43.040]  It's selling out, and your purchase doesn't just help yourself and your body, it also
[44:43.040 --> 44:46.760]  funds the m4war and keeps us on air while they're trying to shut everybody down.

[44:56.760 --> 45:00.960]  God bless and good luck.
[45:00.960 --> 45:29.800]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[45:29.800 --> 45:34.840]  So I'm going to say this again, they are in planning to break the economy, wreck Main
[45:34.840 --> 45:40.280]  Street completely, paying all small businesses, we're already almost a year into this, collapse
[45:40.280 --> 45:44.760]  the third world with total starvation, flood us with them, and the human will manage the
[45:44.760 --> 45:50.160]  migration floods, they will manage the COVID hoax along with the big corporations that
[45:50.160 --> 45:55.560]  will stay open and consolidate total control, and there's massive caravans on their way
[45:55.560 --> 46:01.080]  through Guatemala and Mexico, now that Biden is in and he has already frozen deportations
[46:01.080 --> 46:04.480]  and is going to let them in, which again will further break the borders.
[46:04.480 --> 46:07.320]  This is a scientific plan.
[46:07.320 --> 46:13.760]  All we need is a few more Tulsi Gabbards, a few more Donald Trumps, all we need is a
[46:13.760 --> 46:21.680]  few more Tucker Carlson's and a lot more Alex Joneses and a lot more you out there.
[46:21.680 --> 46:27.360]  To call this out, I mean, the governor of Texas, folks, has an ongoing executive order,
[46:27.360 --> 46:31.280]  they basically say the master never coming off, and they're going to have Democrat mayors
[46:31.280 --> 46:36.640]  continue to lock economies down, open them back up, lock them down, open them back up.
[46:36.640 --> 46:37.760]  That's the plan.
[46:37.760 --> 46:43.400]  So that next time they lock it down even stronger, you think, well, we'll get out of this soon.
[46:43.400 --> 46:46.080]  That's what the Nazis did, and that's what the Soviets would do.
[46:46.080 --> 46:50.640]  It took the Soviets, the Bolsheviks 10 years to get control of Russia, 10 years to get
[46:50.640 --> 46:52.160]  full control.
[46:52.160 --> 46:55.960]  And they would first say, hey, we're just going to lock down for a week, accept it.
[46:55.960 --> 47:00.200]  Then they would take it off for a month, and they locked down for a month, and then take
[47:00.200 --> 47:04.560]  it off for a month, and they locked down for two months, and take it off for a week.
[47:04.560 --> 47:08.760]  And pretty soon everybody just got used to that.
[47:08.760 --> 47:12.040]  And only a few people got rounded up, and the next it was more and more and more.
[47:12.040 --> 47:17.560]  And that's the cover with this COVID thing for the COVID contact tracers run by the
[47:17.560 --> 47:21.560]  UN and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Clinton Foundation, look it up, coming
[47:21.560 --> 47:25.280]  and grabbing you, coming and controlling you, building the emergency centers, admitting
[47:25.280 --> 47:26.360]  their quote secret.
[47:26.360 --> 47:32.920]  I mean, this is just the end and suspension of due process, and a medical tyranny, and
[47:32.920 --> 47:40.840]  the CDC signed, Biden signed an executive order last Friday, and the CDC in these articles
[47:40.840 --> 47:48.280]  says quote, we have the authority at the CDC to have you arrested and charged federally.
[47:48.280 --> 47:51.600]  So do what we're telling you, and we hope you'll comply voluntarily.
[47:51.600 --> 47:52.600]  What does that mean?
[47:52.600 --> 47:54.040]  You got a gun to their head.
[47:54.040 --> 47:55.160]  It's all a power grab.
[47:55.160 --> 47:56.360]  It's all unconstitutional.
[47:56.360 --> 47:57.360]  It's all illegal.
[47:57.360 --> 48:02.400]  And they didn't just declare cruise ships and airports and trains and buses.
[48:02.400 --> 48:09.920]  They said all travel on the roads, including Uber.
[48:09.920 --> 48:10.920]  What does that mean?
[48:10.920 --> 48:12.920]  Well, because Uber operates in multiple states.
[48:12.920 --> 48:21.920]  They're claiming jurisdiction because it's multi-jurisdictional.
[48:21.920 --> 48:24.720]  So ladies and gentlemen, this is serious.
[48:24.720 --> 48:28.720]  And next it's, oh, violation of federal law, not having your vaccine, violation of federal
[48:28.720 --> 48:30.880]  law, not having your contact tracing app.
[48:30.880 --> 48:32.980]  Everything China has, it's now here.
[48:32.980 --> 48:35.040]  This isn't a creeping death anymore.
[48:35.040 --> 48:40.480]  This is martial law, and it's all based on fraud, it's all based on lies.
[48:40.480 --> 48:44.960]  But we're so into virtue signaling with political correctness, now it's virtue signal America's
[48:44.960 --> 48:46.460]  bad.
[48:46.460 --> 48:48.440]  Virtue signal white people are evil.
[48:48.440 --> 48:50.360]  Virtue signal capitalism is bad.
[48:50.360 --> 48:53.880]  And now it's virtue signaling.
[48:53.880 --> 48:55.840]  Judges have to rule that you must take shots.
[48:55.840 --> 48:57.560]  Judges rule you must wear a mask.
[48:57.560 --> 49:02.680]  But actually in Europe and the U.S., judges have ruled that these lockdowns are unconstitutional.
[49:02.680 --> 49:07.040]  You don't wear a mask, but the corporate company still enforce it.
[49:07.040 --> 49:11.000]  And Biden says he's turning the feds loose to enforce it.
[49:11.000 --> 49:13.720]  This is madness.
[49:13.720 --> 49:16.880]  So back to the articles, Merck, first U.S.
[49:16.880 --> 49:21.680]  pharma giant to abandon COVID vaccine efforts, because it doesn't work.
[49:21.680 --> 49:29.920]  Report, China denying entry to people who took Pfizer-Moderna vaccine.
[49:29.920 --> 49:32.720]  Then it goes on and on and on.
[49:32.720 --> 49:37.960]  I already mentioned some of these articles, but let me get to the articles that I haven't
[49:37.960 --> 49:38.960]  hit yet.
[49:38.960 --> 49:41.680]  Let's get into these right here.
[49:41.680 --> 49:43.920]  China is trying to collect Americans' DNA and more.
[49:43.920 --> 49:44.920]  Former U.S.
[49:44.920 --> 49:48.480]  intel official says China plans to switch to anal swaps.
[49:48.480 --> 49:50.320]  Here's the new articles.
[49:50.320 --> 49:55.640]  Can the arrival of a new coronavirus variant scare Americans into better pandemic behavior?
[49:55.640 --> 49:59.720]  Better behavior, and now it's permanent, it's never going to go away.
[49:59.720 --> 50:02.680]  Not with the vaccines, not with the lockdowns, not with the mask.
[50:02.680 --> 50:03.680]  It's new.
[50:03.680 --> 50:04.680]  It's scary.
[50:04.680 --> 50:05.680]  New variants.
[50:05.680 --> 50:06.680]  It's all lies.
[50:06.680 --> 50:07.680]  All false testing.
[50:07.680 --> 50:08.680]  All fraud.
[50:08.680 --> 50:10.320]  But down the road, they will release a real bio-weapon.
[50:10.320 --> 50:11.760]  Bill Gates has promised you that.
[50:11.760 --> 50:13.440]  He said terrorists will release it.
[50:13.440 --> 50:16.480]  This is all just a drill to make sure you're good little slaves when they do it.
[50:16.480 --> 50:20.920]  Now, here's a really important one I've been mentioning.
[50:20.920 --> 50:28.040]  Emmanuel Macron claims AstraZeneca vaccine is almost ineffective in over 65s because it's
[50:28.040 --> 50:32.040]  killing people over 65.
[50:32.040 --> 50:40.160]  Macron gambles by saying no to lockdown, but stopping flights from outside countries into
[50:40.160 --> 50:41.160]  France.
[50:41.160 --> 50:42.160]  All an exercise of martial law.
[50:42.160 --> 50:45.920]  But he knows that it's such a mass problem against humanity.
[50:45.920 --> 50:49.440]  It's Nazi-level to force these inoculations and cause all this death and illness, and
[50:49.440 --> 50:50.920]  he knows it doesn't work on top of it.
[50:50.920 --> 50:55.200]  He's at least hedging his bet and saying that, just like everybody else is.
[50:55.200 --> 50:58.520]  Macron's vaccine delays symbolize national decline for some.
[50:58.520 --> 50:59.840]  Oh, it's a national decline.
[50:59.840 --> 51:02.080]  They're not like China.
[51:02.080 --> 51:03.080]  Macron gambles.
[51:03.080 --> 51:05.160]  No, he's not gambling.
[51:05.160 --> 51:06.880]  They're gambling by going along with this.
[51:06.880 --> 51:09.240]  Now, here's where it gets really important.
[51:09.240 --> 51:14.840]  Australia cancels COVID vaccine trial over unexpected false positives for HIV.
[51:14.840 --> 51:15.840]  Remember that?
[51:15.840 --> 51:18.360]  So it's now Australia.
[51:18.360 --> 51:23.200]  It's now France, and it's now Merck pulling back from the vaccines.
[51:23.200 --> 51:29.600]  And here is Zero Hedge back in February of last year, HIV insertion stokes fears over
[51:29.600 --> 51:31.720]  artificially created bio-weapon.
[51:31.720 --> 51:35.360]  We covered it at the same time as well, but now it's confirmed showing up false positive
[51:35.360 --> 51:37.480]  HIV because it's in it.
[51:37.480 --> 51:45.280]  Coronavirus far more likely than SARS to bond to human cells in HIV-like mutation.
[51:45.280 --> 51:48.800]  That's even mainstream news.
[51:48.800 --> 51:52.440]  So that's where we are, ladies and gentlemen, and we have the very scientists that have
[51:52.440 --> 51:58.560]  been running the secret projects at Wuhan that are now public, Fauci and Gates, are
[51:58.560 --> 52:02.200]  the ones now running the response to what they've released, and I don't think by accident
[52:02.200 --> 52:06.800]  this has all been preplanned, busted CDC, inflated COVID numbers, accused of violating
[52:06.800 --> 52:10.080]  federal law, recapping this.
[52:10.080 --> 52:13.960]  Medical tyranny, CDC announces all travels from where to mask, threatens arrest.
[52:13.960 --> 52:16.400]  You submit to this, you submit to everything.
[52:16.400 --> 52:20.920]  Forbes celebrates as Biden's CDC makes not wearing a mask, public transport, and Uber
[52:20.920 --> 52:22.840]  a federal crime.
[52:22.840 --> 52:28.000]  And again, the fear-mongering chilling trend, a longer, deadlier pandemic.
[52:28.000 --> 52:35.480]  And in this Axios article, and in others they say, it's going to go for five years.
[52:35.480 --> 52:37.360]  Four or five years, it's permanent.
[52:37.360 --> 52:40.000]  Once they've got you that long, they've got you forever.
[52:40.000 --> 52:44.960]  15 days, two months, six months, a year, four years, five years, wear a two mask, wear
[52:44.960 --> 52:46.600]  a five mask.
[52:46.600 --> 52:49.560]  Now, Fauci says two masks don't help.
[52:49.560 --> 52:50.560]  Last week said it's key.
[52:50.560 --> 52:54.320]  It's all part of telling you what to do, and then putting a little proviso out doesn't
[52:54.320 --> 52:56.720]  actually help you, because it's about a takeover.
[52:56.720 --> 52:59.040]  It's about you're dirty, you're evil, you're bad.
[52:59.040 --> 53:03.480]  Again, all these people that are getting one, two shots, they're still getting COVID.
[53:03.480 --> 53:05.080]  They're probably getting it from it.
[53:05.080 --> 53:06.080]  They're still testing positive.
[53:06.080 --> 53:09.960]  So now they're saying maybe you need five shots, but again, Bill Gates said that eight
[53:09.960 --> 53:10.960]  months ago.
[53:10.960 --> 53:19.520]  Oh, new clinical trials, race fears of coronaviruses, learning how to resist the vaccines, hazmat
[53:19.520 --> 53:24.200]  suits, and space suits, and people in bubbles, and it's on the news, and it must be deadly.
[53:24.200 --> 53:28.800]  I mean, you saw all that, and it's like somebody dressed up in a ghost outfit, jumping out
[53:28.800 --> 53:33.560]  from behind the closet, making you have a heart attack.
[53:33.560 --> 53:38.680]  But you better be scared of Fauci and Gates and Schwab saying you're not essential and
[53:38.680 --> 53:39.680]  the lockdown is forever.
[53:39.680 --> 53:45.360]  I played you four times last week, Klaus Schwab at the Davos meeting last week saying, no
[53:45.360 --> 53:48.680]  one will be allowed to ever be in close contact again.
[53:48.680 --> 53:52.080]  No industry with close contact will exist anymore.
[53:52.080 --> 53:55.840]  Drones and robots will deliver everything.
[53:55.840 --> 53:58.400]  You will have nothing, you will own nothing, and you will love it.
[53:58.400 --> 54:03.240]  And it cuts at Leonardo DiCaprio going, after a virtual meeting.
[54:03.240 --> 54:04.720]  What a scumbag.
[54:04.720 --> 54:07.720]  What a filthball.
[54:07.720 --> 54:11.160]  Because he's going to be able to fly around, and when he goes to a national park, no one
[54:11.160 --> 54:12.160]  will be there.
[54:12.160 --> 54:15.160]  When he goes to a hotel, no one will be there because these guys stole the world through
[54:15.160 --> 54:17.040]  fraud.
[54:17.040 --> 54:19.120]  They stole the world through fraud.
[54:19.120 --> 54:25.920]  They stole it through fraud, and now they want you off of it.
[54:25.920 --> 54:26.920]  That's last year.
[54:26.920 --> 54:28.600]  Yeah, there's Joe Biden in the front row of them.
[54:28.600 --> 54:30.640]  What a group of monsters.
[54:30.640 --> 54:36.760]  And you're putting up with it so they believe you deserve it.
[54:36.760 --> 54:37.760]  Incredible.
[54:37.760 --> 54:39.640]  So you better start saying no at businesses.
[54:39.640 --> 54:40.640]  You better speak out.
[54:40.640 --> 54:41.640]  You better educate folks.
[54:41.640 --> 54:42.640]  You better follow lawsuits.
[54:42.640 --> 54:43.640]  You better go out and protest.
[54:43.640 --> 54:50.520]  You better get your mayors and cities to be sanctuary cities for reality, not the globalist
[54:50.520 --> 54:51.520]  takeover.
[54:51.520 --> 54:53.440]  You've got to do it now, ladies and gentlemen.
[54:53.440 --> 54:55.360]  I'm going to go to break.
[54:55.360 --> 55:00.000]  Peter Schiff to get into the economy, GameStop, Silver's massive surge that I predicted last
[55:00.000 --> 55:03.360]  week wasn't hard to predict, and so much more coming up in the next hour.
[55:03.360 --> 55:07.440]  Please don't forget, DNA Force Plus is selling out quickly.
[55:07.440 --> 55:10.400]  It's the highest quality PQQ in CoQ10 and so much more.
[55:10.400 --> 55:15.200]  This is the Rolls Royce on steroids for your mitochondria, for your cells, for the health
[55:15.200 --> 55:16.200]  of your cells.
[55:16.200 --> 55:18.080]  This is what myself and my family take.
[55:18.080 --> 55:20.840]  That's why I'm as healthy as a bull, even though I eat too much.
[55:20.840 --> 55:22.520]  Living defense is selling out.
[55:22.520 --> 55:25.680]  Next level probiotic, flush out your body and totally clean you up.
[55:25.680 --> 55:26.680]  Probiotic without bacteria.

[55:28.840 --> 55:32.480]  And we also have the tumeric is sold out, the powdered tumeric bodies.

[55:38.400 --> 55:43.000]  stock at infowarstore.com or call till 3-888-253-3139.
[55:43.000 --> 55:45.880]  We'll be back with hour number two, Stay Wicks.
[55:45.880 --> 55:52.880]  We have the technocrats are controlling the food supply, secure your own safe source of
[55:52.880 --> 55:53.880]  food supply sale.
[55:53.880 --> 55:57.480]  It's the new prices in 2021, but it's the lowest price for high quality food you're
[55:57.480 --> 55:59.840]  going to find at infowarstore.com.
[55:59.840 --> 56:03.760]  The subsection is prepared with alex.com, and as all these globalists do this, and
[56:03.760 --> 56:08.520]  as they hoard the food and as they prepare, you need to understand that you need 25-year
[56:08.520 --> 56:10.440]  food supply in the last 25 years.
[56:10.440 --> 56:13.880]  One month, three months, six months, one year supplies, and it's the highest quality you're
[56:13.880 --> 56:14.880]  going to find.
[56:14.880 --> 56:18.200]  And it's just good to have that check box taken care of, and you know you're getting
[56:18.200 --> 56:21.800]  good food at a very good price, and you know that a small percentage of it, because there's
[56:21.800 --> 56:25.200]  not much profit in this, goes to us to fund our operation.
[56:25.200 --> 56:30.200]  So prepare with alex.com or infowarstore.com, you can find the prepare in the subsection
[56:30.200 --> 56:32.760]  there, water filtration, air filtration, it's all there.
[56:32.760 --> 56:36.000]  The technocrats are getting ready to bring in all the force GMO and more, and it's time
[56:36.000 --> 56:37.000]  to start getting prepared.
[56:37.000 --> 56:40.640]  It starts with self-defense, it starts with being prepared, it starts with horrible food,
[56:40.640 --> 56:48.360]  it starts with digging in, with a long, globalist fight, you'll win in the end.
[56:48.360 --> 56:49.920]  We told you it was coming.
[56:49.920 --> 56:55.080]  Under the United Nations pilot program in Singapore, for eight months they've made citizens wear
[56:55.080 --> 56:59.840]  bracelets on their arms that make some social distance and report them back to cell towers
[56:59.840 --> 57:00.840]  to track through every movement.
[57:00.840 --> 57:01.840]  This is for everybody.
[57:01.840 --> 57:02.840]  The way it gets better.
[57:02.840 --> 57:08.640]  Now France has programs in their factories, government, push and sponsor, to make everyone
[57:08.640 --> 57:14.280]  wear actual dog collars so they can make their social distance and report back to simple computers.
[57:14.280 --> 57:16.640]  They're turning us into a commodity.
[57:16.640 --> 57:20.120]  Human animal clones have been around for 50 years, it's all being announced.
[57:20.120 --> 57:25.280]  They are literally taking over the life cycle of humans and making us obsolete, and big corporations
[57:25.280 --> 57:30.120]  downplay that they own us with the gene therapy systems and patents that they've produced.
[57:30.120 --> 57:34.840]  Do you understand, it is a takeover of the entire species of the genetic level, and now
[57:34.840 --> 57:39.120]  they're coming with dog collars, and they're announcing in public schools in the U.S. starting
[57:39.120 --> 57:40.120]  next year it will begin.
[57:40.120 --> 57:41.120]  Did you hear me?
[57:41.120 --> 57:45.600]  Dog collars for your children all based on a hoax, all based on a lie.
[57:45.600 --> 57:51.840]  Info wars continue to spread the word to fight back.
[57:51.840 --> 58:07.040]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[58:07.040 --> 58:11.840]  Well, you've got your diamonds and you've got your...
[58:11.840 --> 58:16.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live broadcasting worldwide on this Monday edition.
[58:16.840 --> 58:19.160]  Tulsi Gabbards left Congress.
[58:19.160 --> 58:20.160]  She's a good lady overall.
[58:20.160 --> 58:23.600]  I disagree with her, but I think she's a well-meaning liberal, not one of the really cold-blooded,
[58:23.600 --> 58:24.600]  globalist ones.
[58:24.600 --> 58:27.400]  But she says the people who went to the Capitol could be terrorist, okay?
[58:27.400 --> 58:30.840]  I think that's an exaggeration, more like rowdy people out of control.
[58:30.840 --> 58:33.960]  But some thought they were there, part of the Q storm, and thought they were there to arrest
[58:33.960 --> 58:34.960]  people.
[58:34.960 --> 58:35.960]  I also don't think it's terrorism.
[58:35.960 --> 58:37.640]  I think it's misguided fools.
[58:37.640 --> 58:42.040]  But she talks about how the Democrats are really terrorists, terrorizing our country,
[58:42.040 --> 58:45.760]  and it's much more dangerous with the security apparatus, and that's absolutely true.
[58:45.760 --> 58:47.160]  So here she is on Tucker Carlson.
[58:47.160 --> 58:50.560]  I appreciate your coming on tonight.
[58:50.560 --> 58:53.160]  So I don't think of you as someone given to hyperbole.
[58:53.160 --> 58:54.840]  You're not throwing wild charges out there.
[58:54.840 --> 58:56.400]  You measure your words.
[58:56.400 --> 58:59.800]  You said you are concerned that we are moving towards a police state.
[58:59.800 --> 59:01.400]  Tell us why you're worried.
[59:01.400 --> 59:07.600]  Well, Tucker, the very first thing that any president does after they've gotten elected
[59:07.600 --> 59:12.600]  any member of Congress, and every one of us who has served in the military, is we take
[59:12.600 --> 59:18.880]  an oath and we swear to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against
[59:18.880 --> 59:21.680]  all enemies, foreign and domestic.
[59:21.680 --> 59:27.360]  The reason that this is the first thing that we do is because our Constitution is the foundation
[59:27.360 --> 59:29.880]  of this country and who we are.
[59:29.880 --> 59:35.400]  It is what guarantees us, our civil liberties, our freedoms that are endowed to us not by
[59:35.400 --> 59:41.760]  any man or person in government, but are endowed to us by our creator.
[59:41.760 --> 59:45.680]  And so this is something that we must all unite around.
[59:45.680 --> 59:49.960]  This is something that we recognize that those who storm the Capitol on January 6th trying
[59:49.960 --> 59:55.600]  to stop Congress from fulfilling their constitutional responsibilities, they were acting as domestic
[59:55.600 --> 59:58.920]  terrorists undermining our Constitution.
[59:58.920 --> 1:00:04.720]  As you pointed out in my video, those like John Brennan, Adam Schiff and others are also
[1:00:04.720 --> 1:00:09.840]  acting as domestic terrorists because they are also undermining our Constitution by trying
[1:00:09.840 --> 1:00:15.240]  to take away our civil liberties and rights that are guaranteed to us.
[1:00:15.240 --> 1:00:19.440]  If you don't mind, I'd like to just quote John Brennan directly so that people can't
[1:00:19.440 --> 1:00:21.800]  say I'm taking this out of context.
[1:00:21.800 --> 1:00:26.040]  Directly John Brennan says, members of the Biden team who have been nominated or appointed
[1:00:26.040 --> 1:00:31.400]  are now moving in laser-like fashion to try to uncover as much as they can about what
[1:00:31.400 --> 1:00:36.240]  looks very similar to insurgency movements they've seen overseas, where they germinate
[1:00:36.240 --> 1:00:42.720]  in different parts of the country and gain strength and bring together an unholy alliance
[1:00:42.720 --> 1:00:51.160]  frequently of religious extremists, authoritarians, fascists, bigots, racists, nativists, and even
[1:00:51.160 --> 1:00:53.280]  libertarians.
[1:00:53.280 --> 1:00:59.400]  This is the extent that they are going to try to undermine the rights and freedoms that
[1:00:59.400 --> 1:01:03.760]  are guaranteed to every one of us, and it's incredibly dangerous.
[1:01:03.760 --> 1:01:08.760]  It is so dangerous, and it's also happening on a greater scale we've ever seen before
[1:01:08.760 --> 1:01:11.960]  because as you point out in the video that I hope every one of our viewers will find
[1:01:11.960 --> 1:01:16.520]  on the internet, it isn't simply government officials and our intel and law enforcement
[1:01:16.520 --> 1:01:21.640]  agencies, it's also private businesses, it's these giant tech monopolies.
[1:01:21.640 --> 1:01:27.400]  What can the rest of us do to protect ourselves, to keep free speech alive in a moment when
[1:01:27.400 --> 1:01:30.720]  it's being crushed all around us?
[1:01:30.720 --> 1:01:32.440]  First of all, keep speaking.
[1:01:32.440 --> 1:01:37.920]  I think this is the most important thing at a time when there is so much fear and threats
[1:01:37.920 --> 1:01:43.280]  and the kind of fomenting of fear that we're seeing coming from the legs of John Brennan.
[1:01:43.280 --> 1:01:44.280]  Take a stand.
[1:01:44.280 --> 1:01:49.680]  We must all take a stand and unite around these principles in our constitution and continue
[1:01:49.680 --> 1:01:54.760]  to speak freely, whether it be in person, on the street corner, or on these virtual
[1:01:54.760 --> 1:02:00.120]  public squares, these town squares that exist online.
[1:02:00.120 --> 1:02:05.400]  Big tech is culpable in this, in that they are using their monopolistic power to pick
[1:02:05.400 --> 1:02:09.720]  and choose whose voices are heard and whose voices are squelched, whether it's based
[1:02:09.720 --> 1:02:14.920]  on who they agree with, disagree with, political affiliation, who you voted for, or whatever.
[1:02:14.920 --> 1:02:16.920]  I think there are alternative platforms.
[1:02:16.920 --> 1:02:20.360]  I've got one on Tulsi.locals.com.
[1:02:20.360 --> 1:02:25.660]  It's a place where people can come and speak freely and have open dialogue and conversation
[1:02:25.660 --> 1:02:31.560]  around different issues based on respect and this appreciation for our constitutional
[1:02:31.560 --> 1:02:33.000]  rights and freedoms.
[1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:37.000]  But I think most importantly, we need to urge President Biden and every member of Congress
[1:02:37.000 --> 1:02:41.440]  how critical it is they take a stand and denounce the likes of John Brennan and Adam
[1:02:41.440 --> 1:02:43.480]  Schiff's actions.
[1:02:43.480 --> 1:02:50.280]  Because if we do not, and if they do not, then this country that we love and cherish
[1:02:50.280 --> 1:02:51.480]  will no longer exist.
[1:02:51.480 --> 1:02:52.480]  Absolutely.
[1:02:52.480 --> 1:02:59.160]  This is a corporate fascist world government takeover.
[1:02:59.160 --> 1:03:00.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've studied history.
[1:03:00.720 --> 1:03:02.560]  I've interviewed all the experts.
[1:03:02.560 --> 1:03:07.920]  I have looked at every facet of this and now, only days until the inauguration of the Chai
[1:03:07.920 --> 1:03:10.600]  Com agent, it's all coming into place.
[1:03:10.600 --> 1:03:12.720]  That's how they change the subject from election fraud.
[1:03:12.720 --> 1:03:15.120]  It's how they change the subject from Hunter's laptop.
[1:03:15.120 --> 1:03:21.200]  It's how they change the subject from Epstein and Obama and Al Qaeda and the New World War
[1:03:21.200 --> 1:03:27.000]  and now use the already martial law in place for COVID-19, and that's what it is, to then
[1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:31.040]  be expanded and become political and become permanent.
[1:03:31.040 --> 1:03:32.280]  They train you to stay in your houses.
[1:03:32.280 --> 1:03:33.600]  They train you to be tracked.
[1:03:33.600 --> 1:03:37.080]  They train and do what you're told for nine, 10 months as training wheels, and now they
[1:03:37.080 --> 1:03:38.480]  launch the storm.
[1:03:38.480 --> 1:03:40.000]  The storm is here.
[1:03:40.000 --> 1:03:42.520]  It's a globalist storm.
[1:03:42.520 --> 1:03:44.080]  There's not going to be martial law for Trump.
[1:03:44.080 --> 1:03:46.760]  There's going to be martial law for the globalist.
[1:03:46.760 --> 1:03:48.280]  They're trying to set you up.
[1:03:48.280 --> 1:03:50.360]  Don't be involved in violence.
[1:03:50.360 --> 1:03:53.760]  Use the New World Order and expose the takeover with information.
[1:03:53.760 --> 1:04:22.760]  That's how we beat these people with truth.
[1:04:24.760 --> 1:04:29.720]  Well, there's a lot of hype out there, but I've been interviewing this fellow for probably
[1:04:29.720 --> 1:04:34.320]  16, 17 years, and he's made a lot of really accurate predictions about what happened in
[1:04:34.320 --> 1:04:35.640]  2008 and so much more.
[1:04:35.640 --> 1:04:40.360]  Peter Schiff, EuroPak.com, he's an American businessman, investment broker, author, financial
[1:04:40.360 --> 1:04:41.360]  commentator.
[1:04:41.360 --> 1:04:44.680]  He's a CEO and chief global strategist at Europe Pacific Capital, Inc., and I'm not
[1:04:44.680 --> 1:04:46.760]  going to spend all the time going over it.
[1:04:46.760 --> 1:04:50.120]  He's written a lot of books, done a lot of really important work, but on a lot of national
[1:04:50.120 --> 1:04:54.440]  TV shows until he wasn't saying what they wanted to hear, but he's still out there quite
[1:04:54.440 --> 1:04:55.440]  a bit.
[1:04:55.440 --> 1:04:56.440]  EuroPak.com.
[1:04:56.440 --> 1:05:00.960]  We appreciate him joining us, and we can start anywhere he wants to go.
[1:05:00.960 --> 1:05:05.720]  GameStop, the short squeeze, what's happening in silver.
[1:05:05.720 --> 1:05:09.360]  I mean, I'm not a rocket scientist, and I said middle of the week last week, look for silver
[1:05:09.360 --> 1:05:14.440]  to explode as soon as they figure out that that that that that's an even better target
[1:05:14.440 --> 1:05:19.360]  to go after these hedge funds, but he's got his own views on this, an expert view.
[1:05:19.360 --> 1:05:25.240]  We'll also talk about the big economy, the post-Trump world, the moves Biden's making,
[1:05:25.240 --> 1:05:26.920]  and what he expects to unfold.
[1:05:26.920 --> 1:05:30.920]  And I'm not just a talk show host, I'm a father, and I'm an American, and I'm a human,
[1:05:30.920 --> 1:05:33.960]  so I'm really looking forward to what he has to say because I'm trying to make a lot of
[1:05:33.960 --> 1:05:39.280]  decisions based on what he and a lot of others I respect think is going to happen because
[1:05:39.280 --> 1:05:43.520]  I know Schiff will tell us what he really thinks is going on versus what a lot of these
[1:05:43.520 --> 1:05:47.000]  other big brokerage firm owners will tell you what they want you to hear.
[1:05:47.000 --> 1:05:49.560]  So great to have you, Peter, from EuroPak.com.
[1:05:49.560 --> 1:05:50.560]  Where do you want to start?
[1:05:50.560 --> 1:05:52.680]  This is an insane time, isn't it?
[1:05:52.680 --> 1:05:58.480]  Well, I mean, it's been insane for a while, but maybe it's a little bit more obvious now
[1:05:58.480 --> 1:06:00.160]  to some people.
[1:06:00.160 --> 1:06:05.800]  But there's actually some rationality beneath that veneer of insanity in some of what's
[1:06:05.800 --> 1:06:06.800]  going on.
[1:06:06.800 --> 1:06:11.200]  But we should probably start with what's happening today with silver, because I think silver
[1:06:11.200 --> 1:06:16.960]  is a lot more important than the short squeeze in GameStop and some of these other stocks,
[1:06:16.960 --> 1:06:20.760]  because, you know, short squeezes have been going on for as long as there's been shorting.
[1:06:20.760 --> 1:06:23.760]  I mean, there's nothing new about that.
[1:06:23.760 --> 1:06:29.600]  What's new is maybe the publicity this one is getting and the way it's come about.
[1:06:29.600 --> 1:06:33.440]  But you know, I think what's more important is what's happening in silver.
[1:06:33.440 --> 1:06:36.320]  And you know, the silver move was going to happen anyway.
[1:06:36.320 --> 1:06:40.320]  I mean, I think obviously the move today, we have silver up better than two dollars
[1:06:40.320 --> 1:06:41.320]  an ounce.
[1:06:41.320 --> 1:06:42.320]  That's a pretty big move.
[1:06:42.320 --> 1:06:47.600]  In fact, if you look at the price of silver relative to the price of gold, silver is as
[1:06:47.600 --> 1:06:51.920]  high as it's been in many years now against gold, although silver was very cheap.
[1:06:51.920 --> 1:06:56.680]  And we talked about that on your program and I've been talking about it on my podcast.
[1:06:56.680 --> 1:07:01.640]  That's one of the reasons I've been encouraging people to buy silver because of how historically
[1:07:01.640 --> 1:07:06.320]  cheap silver became in terms of gold.
[1:07:06.320 --> 1:07:09.240]  So it's not nearly as cheap now as it was.
[1:07:09.240 --> 1:07:12.280]  But historically, it's still undervalued.
[1:07:12.280 --> 1:07:18.080]  And so in contrast to a lot of these Wall Street best guys on Reddit who are now buying
[1:07:18.080 --> 1:07:23.760]  GameStop or AMC or a number of these stocks, anyone buying these stocks, I mean, if you
[1:07:23.760 --> 1:07:26.960]  get caught with them when the music stops, you're going to lose.
[1:07:26.960 --> 1:07:27.960]  You're going to lose a lot.
[1:07:27.960 --> 1:07:31.760]  I mean, you're buying extremely overvalued stocks.
[1:07:31.760 --> 1:07:36.960]  I mean, there's a reason that so many short sellers were attracted to these stocks because
[1:07:36.960 --> 1:07:41.800]  their business models are flawed and the companies are in a lot of trouble.
[1:07:41.800 --> 1:07:45.640]  And so smart people are betting that the companies are going to fail.
[1:07:45.640 --> 1:07:47.600]  And that's probably a smart bet.
[1:07:47.600 --> 1:07:49.400]  I wouldn't want to fade that bet.
[1:07:49.400 --> 1:07:54.960]  I think some of these hedge funds were a little overly short and they got caught.
[1:07:54.960 --> 1:07:56.680]  And that's OK.
[1:07:56.680 --> 1:07:58.600]  I mean, that's the way the game works.
[1:07:58.600 --> 1:08:00.680]  I mean, you don't make money for free.
[1:08:00.680 --> 1:08:03.760]  You take risks and that's one of them when you're short.
[1:08:03.760 --> 1:08:05.040]  And so they're big boys.
[1:08:05.040 --> 1:08:06.680]  They can afford to lose money.
[1:08:06.680 --> 1:08:11.360]  My concern is that you've got a lot of smaller investors who don't really realize what they're
[1:08:11.360 --> 1:08:15.760]  doing when they buy these stocks and they see the price going up and they think, well,
[1:08:15.760 --> 1:08:16.960]  they're a good investment.
[1:08:16.960 --> 1:08:18.840]  The price is going to keep going up.
[1:08:18.840 --> 1:08:19.840]  It's not.
[1:08:19.840 --> 1:08:21.920]  The price is going to crash.
[1:08:21.920 --> 1:08:24.800]  And the people who are making money are the ones who are selling.
[1:08:24.800 --> 1:08:27.160]  Not the people who are buying now.
[1:08:27.160 --> 1:08:30.960]  Maybe they'll be able to flip out of it, but they're playing with fire.
[1:08:30.960 --> 1:08:35.400]  If you hold these stocks long enough, they are going to crash and a lot of money will
[1:08:35.400 --> 1:08:36.400]  be lost.
[1:08:36.400 --> 1:08:39.200]  That is not the case with silver.
[1:08:39.200 --> 1:08:43.200]  Even though there are a number of shorts in silver, silver is cheap.
[1:08:43.200 --> 1:08:45.480]  And these silver stocks are great values.
[1:08:45.480 --> 1:08:50.040]  And even if people are rushing in today and pushing up the price a little bit too much,
[1:08:50.040 --> 1:08:54.960]  and I would expect there to be a correction from the big moves that we've seen, don't
[1:08:54.960 --> 1:08:56.200]  get discouraged.
[1:08:56.200 --> 1:08:57.800]  People should be buying more.
[1:08:57.800 --> 1:09:02.160]  People should maybe be using limits and not just crowding in in the morning and letting
[1:09:02.160 --> 1:09:04.440]  people run up the price on you.
[1:09:04.440 --> 1:09:10.040]  But I think that people on Reddit who are buying silver are going to be glad that they
[1:09:10.040 --> 1:09:15.800]  did in six months or a year, whereas a lot of the people who are buying these heavily
[1:09:15.800 --> 1:09:17.800]  shorted stocks are going to be very upset.
[1:09:17.800 --> 1:09:18.800]  Do you think that was good advice?
[1:09:18.800 --> 1:09:23.680]  I wasn't giving it as a financial person or advice to folks, but I just personally said
[1:09:23.680 --> 1:09:27.600]  it seems to me a lot safer place to be would be silver and then gold after that because
[1:09:27.600 --> 1:09:31.920]  we know silver is way undervalued compared to the inflation that's in the market and
[1:09:31.920 --> 1:09:32.920]  the inflation of the currencies.
[1:09:32.920 --> 1:09:37.080]  And I know you talked about this a lot on air in the past, how they have all this paper
[1:09:37.080 --> 1:09:42.240]  silver out there, but the brokers and hedge funds never really actually cash it in for
[1:09:42.240 --> 1:09:43.240]  physical silver.
[1:09:43.240 --> 1:09:45.440]  Can you explain how that works to people?
[1:09:45.440 --> 1:09:50.420]  Because I've seen the articles out there of 100, 200, 300 percent more digital silver
[1:09:50.420 --> 1:09:52.280]  out there than actual physical silver.
[1:09:52.280 --> 1:09:54.000]  What's the real numbers from your research?
[1:09:54.000 --> 1:09:55.000]  Yeah.
[1:09:55.000 --> 1:10:01.400]  And in fact, I titled my podcast the day that the story really broke about the short squeeze
[1:10:01.400 --> 1:10:03.240]  in GameStop.
[1:10:03.240 --> 1:10:08.200]  And the title of my podcast was the mother of all short squeezes is yet to come.
[1:10:08.200 --> 1:10:12.520]  And I was referring to the one in precious metals in silver and in gold.
[1:10:12.520 --> 1:10:17.600]  And then of course the next day, not that I'm taking credit for it, but maybe they probably
[1:10:17.600 --> 1:10:18.600]  had it in the works.
[1:10:18.600 --> 1:10:24.760]  But the next day, that's exactly the type of articles that I was reading up on Reddit
[1:10:24.760 --> 1:10:29.480]  was about these shorts in silver in particular.
[1:10:29.480 --> 1:10:35.960]  And the way a lot of this comes about is most of the metal that's traded is traded on futures
[1:10:35.960 --> 1:10:36.960]  markets.
[1:10:36.960 --> 1:10:42.160]  So people aren't actually trading the physical bars of gold and silver.
[1:10:42.160 --> 1:10:44.960]  They're trading contracts in a futures market.
[1:10:44.960 --> 1:10:46.440]  And there's a lot of leverage there.
[1:10:46.440 --> 1:10:51.320]  Each contract for a silver contract, that's 5,000 ounces.
[1:10:51.320 --> 1:10:54.760]  But you don't have to have the money to cover the 5,000 ounces.
[1:10:54.760 --> 1:10:59.680]  You just need a few percent of the value and you can buy the contract.
[1:10:59.680 --> 1:11:06.720]  And so what happens is you have a lot more paper silver being traded than actual silver
[1:11:06.720 --> 1:11:08.560]  that exists.
[1:11:08.560 --> 1:11:15.720]  But as long as the people who are buying the contracts don't actually want the silver,
[1:11:15.720 --> 1:11:20.040]  it's not a problem because they're buying it from people who want to bet that silver
[1:11:20.040 --> 1:11:24.400]  is going down or maybe you want a hedge or portfolio that's long silver.
[1:11:24.400 --> 1:11:27.360]  And so they're selling these futures contracts.
[1:11:27.360 --> 1:11:31.360]  But a lot of these speculators who are short the futures contracts, they don't actually
[1:11:31.360 --> 1:11:33.660]  have any silver to deliver.
[1:11:33.660 --> 1:11:38.920]  But it's not a problem because they know that the counterparty who's long the silver doesn't
[1:11:38.920 --> 1:11:40.480]  actually want the silver.
[1:11:40.480 --> 1:11:42.680]  He just wants to bet that it goes up.
[1:11:42.680 --> 1:11:49.720]  Well, what would happen if a lot of the people who have been buying silver futures contracts
[1:11:49.720 --> 1:11:53.280]  decide that they actually want the silver?
[1:11:53.280 --> 1:11:55.760]  They just don't want to bet that the price goes up.
[1:11:55.760 --> 1:12:00.960]  They actually want to take delivery of their bars, which is their right to do.
[1:12:00.960 --> 1:12:07.000]  And if that were to ever happen with any significant quantity and all the people who were short
[1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:12.760]  were given notices from the COMEX, hey, you got to deliver the physical silver.
[1:12:12.760 --> 1:12:14.120]  They don't have it.
[1:12:14.120 --> 1:12:15.720]  Now they got to try to buy it.
[1:12:15.720 --> 1:12:17.200]  Well, where are you going to find it?
[1:12:17.200 --> 1:12:19.320]  There is not a lot of physical silver.
[1:12:19.320 --> 1:12:23.000]  That's the problem that these shorts were having in GameStop.
[1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:25.720]  They borrowed the stock to go short.
[1:12:25.720 --> 1:12:29.760]  Now they have to close out their positions because they're getting margin calls.
[1:12:29.760 --> 1:12:31.600]  So they have to go into the market and buy the shares.
[1:12:31.600 --> 1:12:32.600]  All right, Peter, stay there.
[1:12:32.600 --> 1:12:33.600]  Stay there.
[1:12:33.600 --> 1:12:35.100]  I want to ask you what you think is coming.
[1:12:35.100 --> 1:12:36.100]  There's a big difference.
[1:12:36.100 --> 1:12:38.240]  GameStop can issue new stock.
[1:12:38.240 --> 1:12:42.320]  I mean, they can issue more shares, sell them into the market, and that's something that
[1:12:42.320 --> 1:12:47.000]  they're going to be doing to take advantage of their overvalued stock.
[1:12:47.000 --> 1:12:48.520]  That can't happen with silver.
[1:12:48.520 --> 1:12:51.320]  You just can't magically create more silver.
[1:12:51.320 --> 1:12:52.320]  You need to mine it.
[1:12:52.320 --> 1:12:55.440]  And that that takes a lot of time to do.
[1:12:55.440 --> 1:12:59.560]  So really, there could be a fantastic short squeeze in silver.
[1:12:59.560 --> 1:13:04.680]  But I don't think, you know, that the raiders over at Reddit are big enough to do it.
[1:13:04.680 --> 1:13:07.940]  I mean, maybe it's possible they can get it started.
[1:13:07.940 --> 1:13:11.400]  But there's going to have to be some bigger players that are going to have to join in.
[1:13:11.400 --> 1:13:12.560]  It's a global market.
[1:13:12.560 --> 1:13:14.080]  It's much larger.
[1:13:14.080 --> 1:13:18.440]  But eventually it's going to happen, whether it's going to happen now or at some time
[1:13:18.440 --> 1:13:22.240]  in the future, those silver shorts are going to get squeezed.
[1:13:22.240 --> 1:13:25.400]  I think the price of silver is going to go ballistic.
[1:13:25.400 --> 1:13:28.960]  And I think anyone who's buying it now is doing a smart thing.
[1:13:28.960 --> 1:13:29.960]  You're going to make money.
[1:13:29.960 --> 1:13:32.600]  I mean, be careful, you know, with the market now and the volatility.
[1:13:32.600 --> 1:13:33.600]  You can use limits.
[1:13:33.600 --> 1:13:34.800]  You can be patient.
[1:13:34.800 --> 1:13:37.440]  But buy on these dips if you get any.
[1:13:37.440 --> 1:13:40.920]  And I think the silver stocks in particular are there for people who want to be more
[1:13:40.920 --> 1:13:41.920]  aggressive.
[1:13:41.920 --> 1:13:43.920]  I'm not sure you can hear me.
[1:13:43.920 --> 1:13:44.920]  We got to go to break Peter.
[1:13:44.920 --> 1:13:45.920]  We're going to come right back.
[1:13:45.920 --> 1:13:48.200]  We're going to come right back and talk about what you think is coming next.
[1:13:48.200 --> 1:13:54.640]  Stay with us.
[1:13:54.640 --> 1:13:58.000]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[1:13:58.000 --> 1:14:02.340]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[1:14:02.340 --> 1:14:07.040]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them
[1:14:07.040 --> 1:14:11.560]  a bottle of ultimate fish oil from InfowarsStore.com.
[1:14:11.560 --> 1:14:16.360]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower
[1:14:16.360 --> 1:14:22.080]  blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide
[1:14:22.080 --> 1:14:28.080]  a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[1:14:28.080 --> 1:14:34.720]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function
[1:14:34.720 --> 1:14:39.320]  by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[1:14:39.320 --> 1:14:45.080]  It worked for my family, and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual
[1:14:45.080 --> 1:14:47.920]  facts that pertain to reality.
[1:14:47.920 --> 1:14:54.240]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member, or yourself at InfowarsStore.com.

[1:15:57.400 --> 1:16:03.480]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:16:03.480 --> 1:16:17.680]  You thought the lead in winter would bring you down forever, but you rode upon a steamer
[1:16:17.680 --> 1:16:21.200]  to the violence of the sun.
[1:16:21.200 --> 1:16:28.480]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[1:16:28.480 --> 1:16:34.320]  When Peter Schiff of Europac.com, a real financial expert, really respected, has been a very accurate
[1:16:34.320 --> 1:16:39.720]  track record, is our guest for the hour, very pleased to have him, really enjoyed seeing
[1:16:39.720 --> 1:16:43.520]  him on some of the other biggest podcasts out there, and to hear his information reaching
[1:16:43.520 --> 1:16:45.360]  tens of millions.
[1:16:45.360 --> 1:16:50.800]  Former SEC commissioner compares GameStop squeezed a capital riot, Laura Inger, but
[1:16:50.800 --> 1:16:51.800]  it gets worse.
[1:16:51.800 --> 1:16:53.600]  Why was I putting Peter Strach up there?
[1:16:53.600 --> 1:16:55.920]  Well, guess what, ladies and gentlemen?
[1:16:55.920 --> 1:17:06.960]  They have hired his wife to head up the criminal division, here it is, amid turmoil, SEC names
[1:17:06.960 --> 1:17:11.200]  wife of disgraced FBI agent Peter Strach as division director.
[1:17:11.200 --> 1:17:17.800]  So you talk about police state, they are rewarding all of these people that slit America's throat.
[1:17:17.800 --> 1:17:21.240]  Let's go ahead and play the former SEC commissioner, Laura Inger.
[1:17:21.240 --> 1:17:26.000]  It really puts a lot of question about the integrity of the market, right?
[1:17:26.000 --> 1:17:31.000]  And it really kind of, everybody scratching their heads over this, what should happen?
[1:17:31.000 --> 1:17:34.560]  What is the right thing to do to control this or stop this?
[1:17:34.560 --> 1:17:38.320]  Not unlike what we saw on January 6th at the Capitol, right?
[1:17:38.320 --> 1:17:43.200]  If you don't have the police in there at the right time, things go a little crazy.
[1:17:43.200 --> 1:17:47.480]  And that kind of feels like what's happening with this, much different, much lesser degree,
[1:17:47.480 --> 1:17:54.840]  it's financial harm, not personal bodily harm, but certainly that's the same kind of platform
[1:17:54.840 --> 1:18:00.720]  created frenzy that people are operating under, and these are very trying times.
[1:18:00.720 --> 1:18:01.720]  All right.
[1:18:01.720 --> 1:18:06.600]  Right before I went to break a few minutes ago, our audio to Peter Schiff was out, that's
[1:18:06.600 --> 1:18:10.040]  why I couldn't hear me until he missed his question, but I was asking, what do you expect
[1:18:10.040 --> 1:18:15.840]  to be different under Obama 2.0, we know Obama's pulling the strings, calling the shots.
[1:18:15.840 --> 1:18:19.760]  What do you expect to happen in this new Biden administration versus Trump just in the big
[1:18:19.760 --> 1:18:20.760]  market picture?
[1:18:20.760 --> 1:18:24.040]  And what do you make of statements like this about GameStop that this is like some form
[1:18:24.040 --> 1:18:25.040]  of terrorism?
[1:18:25.040 --> 1:18:33.640]  Well, first of all, I think one of the big differences between Biden and Obama is that
[1:18:33.640 --> 1:18:41.360]  I don't think the Republican opposition is going to be able to push back as much on the
[1:18:41.360 --> 1:18:44.400]  spending and the deficits.
[1:18:44.400 --> 1:18:50.680]  That is one of the problems that is going to be left over from the Trump experience
[1:18:50.680 --> 1:18:58.320]  in that the Republicans did not object at all to massive deficit spending under Trump.
[1:18:58.320 --> 1:19:04.240]  Government spending increased dramatically for both warfare and welfare into Trump years.
[1:19:04.240 --> 1:19:11.720]  And so I have a hard time seeing how the Republicans can try to claim that programs are too expensive
[1:19:11.720 --> 1:19:18.760]  or that we can't afford it and that it's just going to be too big an increase in the deficit
[1:19:18.760 --> 1:19:22.680]  when they weren't complaining when it was happening on Trump's watch.
[1:19:22.680 --> 1:19:24.200]  So I think that's going to be a problem.
[1:19:24.200 --> 1:19:29.440]  That's one of the things I was warning about during the Trump presidency, that these big
[1:19:29.440 --> 1:19:33.480]  deficits were going to come back to bite the Republicans when it was the Democrats that
[1:19:33.480 --> 1:19:34.880]  were going to be running them.
[1:19:34.880 --> 1:19:39.360]  Because if you think the deficits were big under Trump and they were, we had record budget
[1:19:39.360 --> 1:19:42.800]  deficits and record trade deficits too under Trump.
[1:19:42.800 --> 1:19:46.680]  But both of those are going to get even bigger under the Democrats.
[1:19:46.680 --> 1:19:52.000]  And I just don't think there's going to be the ability of the Republicans to do anything
[1:19:52.000 --> 1:19:56.800]  to slow it down, especially with COVID, which is really the gift that keeps on giving to
[1:19:56.800 --> 1:20:01.520]  the government because they can justify whatever they do based on COVID.
[1:20:01.520 --> 1:20:07.880]  And now they've manufactured another crisis, the so-called coup d'etat, the insurrection
[1:20:07.880 --> 1:20:13.320]  in Washington DC, which was really just a political protest.
[1:20:13.320 --> 1:20:19.120]  And when you have these kind of protests, sometimes people get a little crazed or they
[1:20:19.120 --> 1:20:21.400]  go a little too far.
[1:20:21.400 --> 1:20:25.960]  But now they're going to turn this into a terrorist incident, which it clearly was not.
[1:20:25.960 --> 1:20:30.800]  They're going to use it as a justification for some kind of new, a patriot act, which
[1:20:30.800 --> 1:20:36.120]  is unfortunately what George Bush did when we were attacked by 9-11.
[1:20:36.120 --> 1:20:39.360]  But at least we were actually attacked during 9-11.
[1:20:39.360 --> 1:20:40.760]  This was not an attack.
[1:20:40.760 --> 1:20:42.320]  This is a bunch of nonsense.
[1:20:42.320 --> 1:20:50.120]  But the Democrats are going to be able to use this to justify further increases in government.
[1:20:50.120 --> 1:20:53.680]  They're going to further limit our freedoms and our individual liberties.
[1:20:53.680 --> 1:20:55.040]  And this is going to hit everybody.
[1:20:55.040 --> 1:21:00.160]  It's not just going to be the MAGA guys that are going to lose constitutional rights and
[1:21:00.160 --> 1:21:01.160]  freedom.
[1:21:01.160 --> 1:21:03.640]  It's going to be everybody in the country that's going to be losing it.
[1:21:03.640 --> 1:21:09.600]  So all the people who think this is great and that are celebrating what's going to be
[1:21:09.600 --> 1:21:15.080]  happening, believe me, when you get in bed with the government, you know what happens
[1:21:15.080 --> 1:21:16.080]  to you.
[1:21:16.080 --> 1:21:21.840]  And so a lot of people are going to be disappointed that they were willing to support this, because
[1:21:21.840 --> 1:21:26.400]  normally you would think that people on the left, oh, you're in favor of civil liberties.
[1:21:26.400 --> 1:21:28.160]  You want freedom of expression.
[1:21:28.160 --> 1:21:31.920]  You want freedom of speech and freedom of assembly.
[1:21:31.920 --> 1:21:36.600]  And all that is going to be curtailed based on what the government is doing.
[1:21:36.600 --> 1:21:43.320]  But I really want to talk about the SEC trying to come out and say, oh, this, you know, we
[1:21:43.320 --> 1:21:44.320]  got to come in.
[1:21:44.320 --> 1:21:49.120]  The government has to come in and protect people from what's going on.
[1:21:49.120 --> 1:21:51.280]  The government is the problem.
[1:21:51.280 --> 1:21:56.520]  If we didn't have an SEC, if we didn't have FINRA, if we didn't have all these securities
[1:21:56.520 --> 1:22:00.240]  regulations, far fewer people would be getting ripped off.
[1:22:00.240 --> 1:22:02.600]  It's the government that is the problem.
[1:22:02.600 --> 1:22:08.080]  The reason that so many small investors do not have any professional help, and they just
[1:22:08.080 --> 1:22:14.360]  have to go it all by themselves, and they're more vulnerable to those type of pump and
[1:22:14.360 --> 1:22:19.000]  dump type things, and they're more likely to make bad investments, the reason is because
[1:22:19.000 --> 1:22:27.080]  the government has made it so expensive for professional money managers, brokers, investment
[1:22:27.080 --> 1:22:34.680]  advisors, you know, like me, they've made it so expensive to deal with the small investor.
[1:22:34.680 --> 1:22:39.580]  Because of all the rules and regulation, nobody will take small customers.
[1:22:39.580 --> 1:22:45.000]  We have such high minimums now in the securities industry, because if we take the small account,
[1:22:45.000 --> 1:22:50.320]  we lose a fortune on the regulatory costs of providing the account.
[1:22:50.320 --> 1:22:54.880]  So now you have all these little investors that because of the government are shut out
[1:22:54.880 --> 1:22:55.880]  from any professional help.
[1:22:55.880 --> 1:22:59.660]  Then they're dumped into a shark tank, then they're dumped into a shark tank like Robinhood
[1:22:59.660 --> 1:23:04.880]  or Ameritrade, where we now know those companies are reportedly selling live time data on their
[1:23:04.880 --> 1:23:08.520]  users to the big hedge funds, so you're literally like in a rig casino.
[1:23:08.520 --> 1:23:13.120]  Yeah, and of course, you know, you don't get something for nothing.
[1:23:13.120 --> 1:23:15.680]  They're trading for free, right?
[1:23:15.680 --> 1:23:17.680]  You're free commissions.
[1:23:17.680 --> 1:23:19.960]  Stock trades aren't free.
[1:23:19.960 --> 1:23:24.640]  So you have to ask yourself, I'm putting all these orders through, the company isn't
[1:23:24.640 --> 1:23:26.660]  charging me anything.
[1:23:26.660 --> 1:23:29.240]  So how are they making their money?
[1:23:29.240 --> 1:23:31.360]  Because they're not making it from me that...
[1:23:31.360 --> 1:23:33.480]  And that's what Washington only does, explain that.
[1:23:33.480 --> 1:23:37.680]  They write regulations where real professionals can't take clients because of liability, because
[1:23:37.680 --> 1:23:41.840]  of cost, but then they incentivize towards big tech with AI to automate it and then really
[1:23:41.840 --> 1:23:42.840]  screw people.
[1:23:42.840 --> 1:23:49.640]  Yeah, because when you have a company like Robinhood, it's all unsolicited, right?
[1:23:49.640 --> 1:23:54.760]  When you work with Robinhood, you don't have a professional advisor that's helping you and
[1:23:54.760 --> 1:23:57.720]  giving you advice and recommendations, right?
[1:23:57.720 --> 1:23:59.680]  So they don't have any responsibility.
[1:23:59.680 --> 1:24:02.120]  They're just like a casino, right?
[1:24:02.120 --> 1:24:06.360]  They're just like got a bunch of slot machines there and, you know, they just let you put
[1:24:06.360 --> 1:24:07.360]  money in.
[1:24:07.360 --> 1:24:10.800]  But if you really start winning, all of a sudden, guys come from the back in dark suits
[1:24:10.800 --> 1:24:13.200]  and drag your ass outside and throw you on the street.
[1:24:13.200 --> 1:24:14.200]  That's just what happens.
[1:24:14.200 --> 1:24:19.400]  Well, exactly, because the people who are supposed to make money are their real customers,
[1:24:19.400 --> 1:24:20.400]  right?
[1:24:20.400 --> 1:24:23.960]  Who is actually paying the bills at Robinhood?
[1:24:23.960 --> 1:24:27.920]  It's the people who are buying all that data and all the orders.
[1:24:27.920 --> 1:24:33.040]  They want to know what these small investors are doing so they can do the opposite.
[1:24:33.040 --> 1:24:34.040]  So they could fade it.
[1:24:34.040 --> 1:24:35.040]  I understand.
[1:24:35.040 --> 1:24:36.520]  I've got so many questions for Schiff.
[1:24:36.520 --> 1:24:40.600]  I want to get into what's coming next, the economy, China.
[1:24:40.600 --> 1:24:41.600]  Where's the inflation?
[1:24:41.600 --> 1:24:42.600]  Where's all that inflation going to go?
[1:24:42.600 --> 1:24:44.040]  We'll talk about it all on the other side.
[1:24:44.040 --> 1:24:52.360]  This is important radio and TV, stay with us.
[1:24:52.360 --> 1:24:56.360]  The globalists are taking control of the entire human genome.
[1:24:56.360 --> 1:24:59.000]  They are forcing mutations.
[1:24:59.000 --> 1:25:01.000]  This is forced evolution, or de-evolution.
[1:25:01.000 --> 1:25:06.080]  When you look at all the major research, all the major programs they're carrying out,
[1:25:06.080 --> 1:25:11.040]  they are not to produce people that are smarter or folks that live longer or are more oral.
[1:25:11.040 --> 1:25:14.120]  They want to know, it's turning humanity into a commodity.
[1:25:14.120 --> 1:25:19.200]  Now we see some propaganda like communist China bragging, hey, we've done mRNA vaccines
[1:25:19.200 --> 1:25:21.200]  to make our soldiers superman.
[1:25:21.200 --> 1:25:25.200]  That's the way to make it sexy that, hey, we're experimenting on our troops.
[1:25:25.200 --> 1:25:29.680]  We'll send things with that into our troops, and thousands and thousands of died each time
[1:25:29.680 --> 1:25:31.680]  they tried a new experimental vaccine.
[1:25:31.680 --> 1:25:36.080]  And I've talked to high-level folks inside the federal government and the state of Texas
[1:25:36.080 --> 1:25:37.080]  self-department.
[1:25:37.080 --> 1:25:40.080]  They say, Alex, you know it hurts a lot of people, it's for a greater good.
[1:25:40.080 --> 1:25:41.080]  But that's not even true.
[1:25:41.080 --> 1:25:46.080]  And it violates the Geneva Convention, the Nuremberg Code, federal and state law.
[1:25:46.080 --> 1:25:49.080]  This is violence being carried out against us by the medical charity.
[1:25:49.080 --> 1:25:53.080]  And we have a right to resist it with any means necessary.
[1:25:53.080 --> 1:26:00.080]  President Trump wanted a landslide on November 3rd, but the globalists weren't going to let that happen.
[1:26:00.080 --> 1:26:05.080]  They had to have some way to repudiate the populist movement, emanating from the United States
[1:26:05.080 --> 1:26:09.080]  that had spread across the world, from the UK to Brazil.
[1:26:09.080 --> 1:26:10.080]  They were desperate.
[1:26:10.080 --> 1:26:11.080]  They admitted their own publications.
[1:26:11.080 --> 1:26:13.080]  They didn't know what to do.
[1:26:13.080 --> 1:26:19.080]  And so they put out 80 million fake ballots, violated state law, and stole it better than
[1:26:19.080 --> 1:26:20.080]  death.
[1:26:20.080 --> 1:26:22.080]  And now they're coming after the president.
[1:26:22.080 --> 1:26:23.080]  They're coming after you.
[1:26:23.080 --> 1:26:24.080]  They're coming after me.
[1:26:24.080 --> 1:26:26.080]  They're shutting everybody off the internet.
[1:26:26.080 --> 1:26:28.080]  They're trying to totally censor us.
[1:26:28.080 --> 1:26:32.080]  And that's why M4 Wars is still in the fight, because we knew this was coming.
[1:26:32.080 --> 1:26:33.080]  We told you this was coming.
[1:26:33.080 --> 1:26:36.080]  We were the first main target that we're still on air.

[1:28:14.080 --> 1:28:19.080]  You know, I told listeners this.
[1:28:19.080 --> 1:28:21.080]  I'm not invested in one Bitcoin.
[1:28:21.080 --> 1:28:23.080]  I'm not invested in the stock market.
[1:28:23.080 --> 1:28:25.080]  I don't have a hedge fund.
[1:28:25.080 --> 1:28:30.080]  I mean, I'm not invested in any type of commodities other than gold and silver, and I ended up
[1:28:30.080 --> 1:28:35.080]  in a divorce having to sell a half million dollars of silver and gold I bought.
[1:28:35.080 --> 1:28:38.080]  It was worth like three million dollars at the time of the divorce.
[1:28:38.080 --> 1:28:40.080]  And my ex-wife didn't believe me and I'm like, we got to sell now.
[1:28:40.080 --> 1:28:42.080]  It was at the top of the market when she was divorcing me.
[1:28:42.080 --> 1:28:45.080]  She waited until it went down by half and then sold it.
[1:28:45.080 --> 1:28:49.080]  But that's been my experience with silver and gold is I basically tripled my money.
[1:28:49.080 --> 1:28:51.080]  And I just had it in a safety deposit box.
[1:28:51.080 --> 1:28:53.080]  It was a backup for me and my family.
[1:28:53.080 --> 1:28:55.080]  That was basically most of my savings.
[1:28:55.080 --> 1:28:58.080]  I had like, I think a half million dollars or something in the bank as well just to be able to run the business
[1:28:58.080 --> 1:28:59.080]  if something happened.
[1:28:59.080 --> 1:29:02.080]  It's a very small, you know, capital thing for an operation like that.
[1:29:02.080 --> 1:29:06.080]  And it was that experience of divorce that made me want to actually go out and make more money
[1:29:06.080 --> 1:29:10.080]  so that I could actually keep this place alive in the future because I used to run with so little
[1:29:10.080 --> 1:29:13.080]  on the tank and we've been a lot more successful since then.
[1:29:13.080 --> 1:29:18.080]  But just pulling back here, I'm not even that smart when it comes to markets.
[1:29:18.080 --> 1:29:21.080]  And I knew, obviously, this is the ultimate short squeeze silver.
[1:29:21.080 --> 1:29:23.080]  Chef, even before I was saying, I didn't see his podcast,
[1:29:23.080 --> 1:29:25.080]  was saying the same thing I guess a day before.
[1:29:25.080 --> 1:29:27.080]  It's just pretty much prima facie.
[1:29:27.080 --> 1:29:31.080]  But big picture.
[1:29:31.080 --> 1:29:36.080]  I mean, as a guy that has billions under management, but also as a father, as a husband,
[1:29:36.080 --> 1:29:38.080]  gut level, because I know you don't like to speculate,
[1:29:38.080 --> 1:29:40.080]  but what do you see happening in the future?
[1:29:40.080 --> 1:29:41.080]  Things are so volatile.
[1:29:41.080 --> 1:29:43.080]  I see so much inflation.
[1:29:43.080 --> 1:29:46.080]  I see governments in a race to evaluate their currencies.
[1:29:46.080 --> 1:29:48.080]  How do you see this shaking out?
[1:29:48.080 --> 1:29:49.080]  What happens to the dollar?
[1:29:49.080 --> 1:29:50.080]  What happens to the yen?
[1:29:50.080 --> 1:29:51.080]  What happens to the euro?
[1:29:51.080 --> 1:29:53.080]  What happens to the young?
[1:29:53.080 --> 1:29:56.080]  Yeah, well, there's a lot there, Alex.
[1:29:56.080 --> 1:30:04.080]  But, you know, we've been on this fiat based monetary system really since 1971
[1:30:04.080 --> 1:30:09.080]  when Nixon famously and temporarily took us off the gold standard.
[1:30:09.080 --> 1:30:11.080]  People don't realize that it was supposed to be temporary.
[1:30:11.080 --> 1:30:13.080]  Well, it's going to be temporary.
[1:30:13.080 --> 1:30:18.080]  It's just going to be a lot longer than people thought at the time.
[1:30:18.080 --> 1:30:26.080]  But we will go back on a gold standard again because the standard we have now does not work.
[1:30:26.080 --> 1:30:34.080]  It is responsible for all of the major global macroeconomic imbalances that exist today.
[1:30:34.080 --> 1:30:40.080]  But, you know, the primary beneficiary of this system has been the United States
[1:30:40.080 --> 1:30:47.080]  because we have been the issuer of the primary reserve currency, the dollar.
[1:30:47.080 --> 1:30:50.080]  And it's a lot easier to print dollars than mine gold.
[1:30:50.080 --> 1:30:52.080]  In fact, you don't even have to print them anymore.
[1:30:52.080 --> 1:30:54.080]  You just electronically create them.
[1:30:54.080 --> 1:30:57.080]  And so we can make all the dollars we want.
[1:30:57.080 --> 1:31:00.080]  And then we use those dollars to buy all these products.
[1:31:00.080 --> 1:31:03.080]  That's how we have these huge trade deficits.
[1:31:03.080 --> 1:31:05.080]  Donald Trump talked about them as a candidate.
[1:31:05.080 --> 1:31:08.080]  Why do we have these massive trade deficits?
[1:31:08.080 --> 1:31:13.080]  Because we print money and then we use that to buy the stuff that we need.
[1:31:13.080 --> 1:31:17.080]  The question is why do our trading partners give us all their valuable stuff
[1:31:17.080 --> 1:31:22.080]  that they work hard to produce for pieces of paper that, you know,
[1:31:22.080 --> 1:31:24.080]  you take no resources at all.
[1:31:24.080 --> 1:31:26.080]  We make them as fast as we want.
[1:31:26.080 --> 1:31:30.080]  And the reason has been because they've been using those dollars as reserves
[1:31:30.080 --> 1:31:35.080]  and therefore they've been investing them in dollar-denominated financial instruments.
[1:31:35.080 --> 1:31:37.080]  But that is going to come to an end.
[1:31:37.080 --> 1:31:41.080]  I think the massive money printing that we've seen recently,
[1:31:41.080 --> 1:31:47.080]  and it's about to go off the charts under Obama, I mean, under Biden.
[1:31:47.080 --> 1:31:49.080]  See, I'm mixing these guys up, but under Biden.
[1:31:49.080 --> 1:31:50.080]  That's not a mistake.
[1:31:50.080 --> 1:31:53.080]  Obama basically runs Biden. Under Obama, you're correct.
[1:31:53.080 --> 1:31:59.080]  But under Biden, you know, with the squad and Bernie Sanders
[1:31:59.080 --> 1:32:02.080]  really pushing them further to the left,
[1:32:02.080 --> 1:32:07.080]  and you have all these Democrats looking to get rewarded for their votes
[1:32:07.080 --> 1:32:12.080]  with all sorts of freebies from Green New Deal stuff to reparations,
[1:32:12.080 --> 1:32:17.080]  to Medicare for all, universal basic income, all sorts of stuff.
[1:32:17.080 --> 1:32:19.080]  And nobody thinks you have to pay for this.
[1:32:19.080 --> 1:32:22.080]  Everybody thinks, well, we just print money and that's fine.
[1:32:22.080 --> 1:32:24.080]  And, you know, we could have whatever we want.
[1:32:24.080 --> 1:32:27.080]  So we're about to take this thing into uncharted territory.
[1:32:27.080 --> 1:32:32.080]  And our creditors who have been underwriting this for decades
[1:32:32.080 --> 1:32:35.080]  and accepting our paper in exchange for their stuff,
[1:32:35.080 --> 1:32:37.080]  they're not going to take it anymore.
[1:32:37.080 --> 1:32:39.080]  And the dollar is going to crash.
[1:32:39.080 --> 1:32:42.080]  We're going to have a U.S. dollar crisis
[1:32:42.080 --> 1:32:46.080]  that will make the financial crisis of 08 look like a Sunday school picnic
[1:32:46.080 --> 1:32:50.080]  much, much worse than what we saw in the early days of COVID.
[1:32:50.080 --> 1:32:54.080]  And we're finally going to see all these inflation chickens coming home to roost.
[1:32:54.080 --> 1:32:57.080]  Prices are going to literally explode through the roof
[1:32:57.080 --> 1:33:02.080]  for all the goods that Americans, you know, need and take for granted.
[1:33:02.080 --> 1:33:04.080]  Things are going to get very expensive.
[1:33:04.080 --> 1:33:07.080]  I think we're going to end up with shortages and price controls
[1:33:07.080 --> 1:33:10.080]  because the government is not going to know how to react to this.
[1:33:10.080 --> 1:33:13.080]  So they're going to make the same mistakes that Nixon made early on
[1:33:13.080 --> 1:33:17.080]  when we initially went off the gold standard, when the world goes off the dollar standard,
[1:33:17.080 --> 1:33:20.080]  the consequences are going to be far greater.
[1:33:20.080 --> 1:33:24.080]  And I think the only way out of this is to return to a gold standard.
[1:33:24.080 --> 1:33:26.080]  I mean, we're going to do it whether we want to or not.
[1:33:26.080 --> 1:33:29.080]  I think when the world rejects the dollar,
[1:33:29.080 --> 1:33:34.080]  I think the only viable alternative to the dollar is gold.
[1:33:34.080 --> 1:33:38.080]  It's not going to be the euro or the yen or the Chinese R&B.
[1:33:38.080 --> 1:33:40.080]  None of these currencies are backed by any.
[1:33:40.080 --> 1:33:44.080]  What do you make of China coming out with its own cryptocurrency?
[1:33:44.080 --> 1:33:49.080]  Well, look, if it's a crypto yuan, right?
[1:33:49.080 --> 1:33:51.080]  Well, I mean, it's the same thing as a paper yuan, right?
[1:33:51.080 --> 1:33:55.080]  It's just a fiat digital currency as opposed to a fiat paper currency.
[1:33:55.080 --> 1:34:00.080]  But, you know, it will be legal tender in China and it will be, you know,
[1:34:00.080 --> 1:34:02.080]  one to one with yuan.
[1:34:02.080 --> 1:34:07.080]  And so it will be a medium of exchange every bit as much as the paper version.
[1:34:07.080 --> 1:34:12.080]  And so all central banks can, you know, can put out their own fiat currencies.
[1:34:12.080 --> 1:34:16.080]  But doesn't this just spell inflation, all these new currencies, all these cryptos,
[1:34:16.080 --> 1:34:18.080]  all these digitals, all these...
[1:34:18.080 --> 1:34:20.080]  It just sounds like you're going to have so much money everywhere.
[1:34:20.080 --> 1:34:23.080]  It sounds like, why am I republicans in Bobway?
[1:34:23.080 --> 1:34:24.080]  It just sounds like a mess.
[1:34:24.080 --> 1:34:29.080]  Well, I don't know that the cryptocurrencies are in and of themselves
[1:34:29.080 --> 1:34:32.080]  meaning there's going to be even more inflation than without them.
[1:34:32.080 --> 1:34:37.080]  What I don't like about the cryptocurrencies is the degree of control
[1:34:37.080 --> 1:34:41.080]  because to the extent that the governments then eliminate the paper currency
[1:34:41.080 --> 1:34:43.080]  and all you have...
[1:34:43.080 --> 1:34:45.080]  Sure, you're saying under blockchain, they know everything you bought,
[1:34:45.080 --> 1:34:48.080]  everything you did is an incredible surveillance system.
[1:34:48.080 --> 1:34:52.080]  Yeah, yeah, and, you know, they can get, they can always take your money.
[1:34:52.080 --> 1:34:53.080]  They don't have to find it.
[1:34:53.080 --> 1:34:56.080]  At least if you have paper currency, you can hide it someplace
[1:34:56.080 --> 1:34:58.080]  and they won't be able to find it.
[1:34:58.080 --> 1:35:01.080]  But they can track everything that's going on on the Internet
[1:35:01.080 --> 1:35:04.080]  and then if they don't like what you're spending your money on
[1:35:04.080 --> 1:35:06.080]  or what you're doing with it.
[1:35:06.080 --> 1:35:11.080]  I mean, there's all sorts of Orwellian implications about a monetary system
[1:35:11.080 --> 1:35:14.080]  where the government knows every single thing that you spend money on.
[1:35:14.080 --> 1:35:18.080]  Well, sure, last year there were statements made that I was getting into cryptocurrency.
[1:35:18.080 --> 1:35:20.080]  All I said is, I like alternative currencies.
[1:35:20.080 --> 1:35:22.080]  I like people having freedom, but people need to know
[1:35:22.080 --> 1:35:24.080]  these are pump-and-dumps that go up and down.
[1:35:24.080 --> 1:35:26.080]  Don't need to be a rocket scientist to know that.
[1:35:26.080 --> 1:35:28.080]  And then you were like, Jones, what are you doing selling out the crypto?
[1:35:28.080 --> 1:35:30.080]  I've taken no money for crypto.
[1:35:30.080 --> 1:35:32.080]  All I'm saying is, I'm for people having freedom.
[1:35:32.080 --> 1:35:36.080]  They just need to know that in this, in that industry,
[1:35:36.080 --> 1:35:40.080]  it's obviously a roller coaster pump-and-dump over and over again.
[1:35:40.080 --> 1:35:42.080]  Look at how Bitcoin crashed a few years ago.
[1:35:42.080 --> 1:35:44.080]  Now went back up with that again.
[1:35:44.080 --> 1:35:45.080]  It's a roller coaster.
[1:35:45.080 --> 1:35:49.080]  Yeah, look, when you have freedom, you also have to accept responsibility.
[1:35:49.080 --> 1:35:52.080]  Those are the, that's the deal.
[1:35:52.080 --> 1:35:54.080]  So you're free to make mistakes.
[1:35:54.080 --> 1:35:57.080]  And if you make mistakes, you're going to lose money.
[1:35:57.080 --> 1:35:59.080]  Now that doesn't mean fraud should be legal.
[1:35:59.080 --> 1:36:01.080]  Fraud is a crime, right?
[1:36:01.080 --> 1:36:02.080]  It's like theft.
[1:36:02.080 --> 1:36:05.080]  You're, you're inducing people to do something by lying to them,
[1:36:05.080 --> 1:36:08.080]  which they wouldn't do if you told them the truth.
[1:36:08.080 --> 1:36:12.080]  So I think there should be laws that punish fraud.
[1:36:12.080 --> 1:36:16.080]  But all this stuff where the government is trying to protect us from ourselves,
[1:36:16.080 --> 1:36:20.080]  the losses are far greater because of the cost of government.
[1:36:20.080 --> 1:36:21.080]  Absolutely. Let's go back.
[1:36:21.080 --> 1:36:25.080]  What do you make of even CNBC with a headline that the hedge funds are the good guys
[1:36:25.080 --> 1:36:27.080]  in this GameStop story?
[1:36:27.080 --> 1:36:29.080]  To me, that's not true.
[1:36:29.080 --> 1:36:34.080]  I mean, these investors are kind of doing their own pump and dump to like get back at Wall Street.
[1:36:34.080 --> 1:36:38.080]  But I don't even see them really doing it is that I see them doing it because they're mad at the system.
[1:36:38.080 --> 1:36:44.080]  But to have the system is the big power structure calling on mommy and daddy to come save them at the securities exchange commission.
[1:36:44.080 --> 1:36:47.080]  That just feels like that feels like a scam to me.
[1:36:47.080 --> 1:36:54.080]  Yeah. Well, first of all, by shorting stocks, you know, you're actually calling attention to an overvalued company.
[1:36:54.080 --> 1:36:59.080]  You know, these guys do a lot of research. I mean, to the extent that they're not, you know, fraudulent.
[1:36:59.080 --> 1:37:06.080]  I mean, let's say you short a stock and then you disseminate all sorts of false information about problems that the company has.
[1:37:06.080 --> 1:37:10.080]  Just so you can push the price down and then you can make a profit.
[1:37:10.080 --> 1:37:13.080]  You know, that type of stuff can be illegal.
[1:37:13.080 --> 1:37:20.080]  But if you legitimately just see a business that's overpriced and maybe you think they're going to go bankrupt and you start shorting the stock.
[1:37:20.080 --> 1:37:23.080]  I mean, what you're doing is you're adding value to the market.
[1:37:23.080 --> 1:37:25.080]  I understand that. And that's a real view.
[1:37:25.080 --> 1:37:29.080]  I'm saying, though, that brokerage firm that lost, you know, three million dollars,
[1:37:29.080 --> 1:37:34.080]  they shouldn't be able to run and bitch that a bunch of private investors saw what they did it and squeezed them.
[1:37:34.080 --> 1:37:38.080]  No, no, no. As I said earlier, that's that's par for the course.
[1:37:38.080 --> 1:37:40.080]  These are big boys that are running hedge funds.
[1:37:40.080 --> 1:37:45.080]  I mean, if you short a stock, even if it's overvalued, you've borrowed it, right?
[1:37:45.080 --> 1:37:48.080]  You're on leverage. It's not there.
[1:37:48.080 --> 1:37:53.080]  We have a segment with Peter Sheffey talking about whatever he wants. I'm sure he's got a lot to talk about.
[1:37:53.080 --> 1:37:56.080]  We have the technocrats are controlling the food supplies.
[1:37:56.080 --> 1:37:59.080]  Secure your own safe source of food supply sale.
[1:37:59.080 --> 1:38:02.080]  It's the new prices in 2021, but it's the lowest price for high quality food.
[1:38:02.080 --> 1:38:07.080]  You're going to find at infowarstore.com. The subsection is prepared with alex.com.
[1:38:07.080 --> 1:38:11.080]  And as all these globalists do this, and as they hoard the food and as they prepare,
[1:38:11.080 --> 1:38:19.080]  they understand that you need 25 year food supply in the last 25 years, one month, three months, six months, one year supplies, and it's the highest quality you're going to find.
[1:38:19.080 --> 1:38:22.080]  And it's just good to have that checkbox taken care of.
[1:38:22.080 --> 1:38:24.080]  And you know you're getting good food at a very good price.
[1:38:24.080 --> 1:38:29.080]  And you know that a small percentage of it because there's not much profit in this goes to us to fund our operation.
[1:38:29.080 --> 1:38:33.080]  So prepare with alex.com or infowarstore.com.
[1:38:33.080 --> 1:38:36.080]  You can find preparing this section there, water filtration, air filtration.
[1:38:36.080 --> 1:38:40.080]  It's all there. The technocrats are getting ready to bring in all the forced GMO and more.
[1:38:40.080 --> 1:38:43.080]  I think it's time to start getting prepared. It starts with self-defense.
[1:38:43.080 --> 1:38:46.080]  It starts with being prepared. It starts with storeable food. It starts with digging in.
[1:38:46.080 --> 1:38:49.080]  With a long, globalist fight, you'll win in the end.
[1:38:52.080 --> 1:38:56.080]  Anybody listening to my voice, you can simply search into the term.
[1:38:56.080 --> 1:39:00.080]  Davos Group, technocracy or technocrats.
[1:39:00.080 --> 1:39:06.080]  You will get Klaus Schwab, and Sean Codd, Yunker, and all the New World Order.
[1:39:06.080 --> 1:39:11.080]  Globalists like Gigi Pink saying that they no longer want elected leaders over governments,
[1:39:11.080 --> 1:39:14.080]  but they want businessmen, technocrats over them.
[1:39:14.080 --> 1:39:16.080]  And that's who Klaus Schwab is.
[1:39:16.080 --> 1:39:21.080]  You might want to look into the guy that says they've launched the COVID-19 lockdowns to bankrupt you and make you poor.
[1:39:21.080 --> 1:39:24.080]  You might want to find out who this super villain is.
[1:39:24.080 --> 1:39:27.080]  But you see, he believes because he's hidden it playing you,
[1:39:27.080 --> 1:39:30.080]  and you're not speaking out against it that he has the right to do it to you.
[1:39:30.080 --> 1:39:32.080]  You might want to find out who he works for.
[1:39:32.080 --> 1:39:34.080]  He works directly for Prince Charles.
[1:39:34.080 --> 1:39:38.080]  He developed, since the 80s, the plan for global sustainability.
[1:39:38.080 --> 1:39:42.080]  That means worldwide neo feudalists in his own works.
[1:39:42.080 --> 1:39:46.080]  So you might want to find out how he talks about using vaccines to sterilize you,
[1:39:46.080 --> 1:39:47.080]  before you take those shots.
[1:39:47.080 --> 1:39:50.080]  You might just want to find out who this villain is.
[1:39:50.080 --> 1:40:16.080]  All right.
[1:40:20.080 --> 1:40:27.080]  So, the new URL before they banned it, but Soros and Bill Gates and the globalists are on our tail.
[1:40:27.080 --> 1:40:32.080]  But the new website is the resistance.video.
[1:40:32.080 --> 1:40:34.080]  The resistance.video.
[1:40:34.080 --> 1:40:38.080]  They're trying to block us because the truth is powerful and can defeat them.
[1:40:38.080 --> 1:40:44.080]  So the new URL that links right to banned.video and all of our videos and all of our documentaries
[1:40:44.080 --> 1:40:49.080]  and all the special reports and all the suppressed information is at the resistance.video.
[1:40:49.080 --> 1:40:50.080]  Share the link.
[1:40:50.080 --> 1:40:52.080]  The resistance.video.
[1:40:52.080 --> 1:40:54.080]  The resistance.video.
[1:40:54.080 --> 1:40:55.080]  I've got some bad news.
[1:40:55.080 --> 1:41:00.080]  Our best selling vitamin mineral fusion has sold out because people understand in these stressful times
[1:41:00.080 --> 1:41:03.080]  it's now more important than ever to boost your body's natural defenses.
[1:41:03.080 --> 1:41:05.080]  But here's the good news.
[1:41:05.080 --> 1:41:11.080]  Turmeric acts in very similar ways and is so good for inflammation, so good for your immune system.
[1:41:11.080 --> 1:41:13.080]  And we've got two great turmeric formulas.
[1:41:13.080 --> 1:41:19.080]  One is body's ultimate turmeric formula that is a dried turmeric extract 95% humanoid.
[1:41:19.080 --> 1:41:20.080]  People love it.
[1:41:20.080 --> 1:41:21.080]  That's selling out.
[1:41:21.080 --> 1:41:24.080]  Despite that, it's still discounted at infowarstore.com.
[1:41:24.080 --> 1:41:29.080]  And then also selling out this week is our liquid turmeric extract.
[1:41:29.080 --> 1:41:31.080]  It's called liquid turmeric extract.
[1:41:31.080 --> 1:41:32.080]  People really love it.
[1:41:32.080 --> 1:41:33.080]  It's extremely strong as well.
[1:41:33.080 --> 1:41:34.080]  It's selling out.
[1:41:34.080 --> 1:41:37.080]  And your purchase doesn't just help yourself and your body.
[1:41:37.080 --> 1:41:42.080]  It also funds the info war and keeps us on air while they're trying to shut everybody down.
[1:41:42.080 --> 1:41:44.080]  So thank you all for your support.
[1:41:44.080 --> 1:41:48.080]  Please visit infowarstore.com and find so many other great items
[1:41:48.080 --> 1:41:52.080]  that will enrich yourself and your family's life and fund the info war.
[1:41:52.080 --> 1:42:13.080]  God bless and good luck.
[1:42:22.080 --> 1:42:40.080]  All right, Peter Schiff here at EuroPak.com.
[1:42:40.080 --> 1:42:42.080]  And I know he's got a lot of topics he probably wants to get into.
[1:42:42.080 --> 1:42:46.080]  He's been gracious when answering my questions.
[1:42:46.080 --> 1:42:51.080]  But before he gets any other final important points he wants to hit,
[1:42:51.080 --> 1:42:53.080]  I have two big questions.
[1:42:53.080 --> 1:42:58.080]  Where would he invest if he was just an average person out there?
[1:42:58.080 --> 1:43:01.080]  A, and then B, I don't like to be alarmist,
[1:43:01.080 --> 1:43:05.080]  but it looks to me like we're way more leveraged and way more fiat
[1:43:05.080 --> 1:43:08.080]  than even Zimbabwe did or Weimar Germany.
[1:43:08.080 --> 1:43:10.080]  And just how long can these bubbles go on?
[1:43:10.080 --> 1:43:14.080]  How long, while they have the COVID lockdown that kills Main Street,
[1:43:14.080 --> 1:43:17.080]  so the real economy shrinks, the third world stars,
[1:43:17.080 --> 1:43:21.080]  there's all this money printing and fiat and, you know, Jeff Bezos has 15 yachts
[1:43:21.080 --> 1:43:23.080]  and Putin's got 20 and they're all just going,
[1:43:23.080 --> 1:43:25.080]  luxury items go up and up and up.
[1:43:25.080 --> 1:43:30.080]  It's just, it has a real tower of babble feeling,
[1:43:30.080 --> 1:43:33.080]  a real disaster level like when they had Occupy Wall Street
[1:43:33.080 --> 1:43:36.080]  and all the rich folks are drinking champagne, laughing at people,
[1:43:36.080 --> 1:43:38.080]  has a Marie Antoinette feel.
[1:43:38.080 --> 1:43:40.080]  So which one you want to take first, how you'd invest
[1:43:40.080 --> 1:43:43.080]  or how long this craziness can go on?
[1:43:43.080 --> 1:43:45.080]  Well, I'll get to them both.
[1:43:45.080 --> 1:43:48.080]  First, let me just finish up the thought from before the break
[1:43:48.080 --> 1:43:49.080]  just to complete it.
[1:43:49.080 --> 1:43:53.080]  But, you know, you don't have to feel sorry for the hedge funds
[1:43:53.080 --> 1:43:55.080]  that are losing money in the short squeeze.
[1:43:55.080 --> 1:43:59.080]  These are very wealthy people who knew the risks going in
[1:43:59.080 --> 1:44:01.080]  and they've made plenty of money.
[1:44:01.080 --> 1:44:02.080]  They can't win them all.
[1:44:02.080 --> 1:44:05.080]  They're going to have some tough times.
[1:44:05.080 --> 1:44:08.080]  But don't assume it's all the little guys versus the hedge funds.
[1:44:08.080 --> 1:44:13.080]  I am sure that behind the scenes there are some big guys,
[1:44:13.080 --> 1:44:17.080]  maybe even other hedge funds that are making a lot of money
[1:44:17.080 --> 1:44:18.080]  on this short squeeze.
[1:44:18.080 --> 1:44:21.080]  I mean, they may have even enlisted the help of some of these
[1:44:21.080 --> 1:44:24.080]  small guys and so they helped do the pump.
[1:44:24.080 --> 1:44:26.080]  And I'm sure they've already dumped.
[1:44:26.080 --> 1:44:30.080]  My concern is for the people, the little guy who don't get the fact
[1:44:30.080 --> 1:44:34.080]  that it's a pump and dump and they helped line the pockets
[1:44:34.080 --> 1:44:37.080]  of other wealthy people and they're going to be stuck
[1:44:37.080 --> 1:44:38.080]  as the bag holder.
[1:44:38.080 --> 1:44:41.080]  So that's why I'm always out there warning people
[1:44:41.080 --> 1:44:43.080]  against these things.
[1:44:43.080 --> 1:44:44.080]  Don't participate.
[1:44:44.080 --> 1:44:47.080]  Don't get suckered in by the large gains
[1:44:47.080 --> 1:44:49.080]  and think that you can come late to the party
[1:44:49.080 --> 1:44:51.080]  and make just as much money.
[1:44:51.080 --> 1:44:52.080]  And you're right.
[1:44:52.080 --> 1:44:54.080]  It's the same thing with the cryptocurrencies
[1:44:54.080 --> 1:44:59.080]  from all the obscure altcoins right up to the granddaddy Bitcoin.
[1:44:59.080 --> 1:45:00.080]  It's the same thing.
[1:45:00.080 --> 1:45:02.080]  It's a worthless digital token.
[1:45:02.080 --> 1:45:03.080]  It's not money.
[1:45:03.080 --> 1:45:04.080]  It's not an asset.
[1:45:04.080 --> 1:45:08.080]  It's never going to be anything other than a speculative vehicle.
[1:45:08.080 --> 1:45:10.080]  And eventually the bottom is going to drop out.
[1:45:10.080 --> 1:45:13.080]  And the people who have been pumping it and pumping it
[1:45:13.080 --> 1:45:16.080]  are the ones that dump it and they walk away with a bunch of money.
[1:45:16.080 --> 1:45:19.080]  And then you have a lot of people who were fooled
[1:45:19.080 --> 1:45:24.080]  and they're the real true believers that have hold the whole time
[1:45:24.080 --> 1:45:26.080]  that have bought their Bitcoin and have never sold.
[1:45:26.080 --> 1:45:28.080]  They're enabling all these other profits.
[1:45:28.080 --> 1:45:32.080]  And eventually when the music stops, the bottom is going to drop out
[1:45:32.080 --> 1:45:35.080]  and people are going to get wiped out in Bitcoin, too.
[1:45:35.080 --> 1:45:39.080]  So if you still have it, you have plenty of opportunity to get out
[1:45:39.080 --> 1:45:43.080]  because there's still a lot of people who don't realize the truth yet,
[1:45:43.080 --> 1:45:45.080]  just like there are a lot of people who don't realize
[1:45:45.080 --> 1:45:48.080]  what's going on with GameStop or any of these other stocks.
[1:45:48.080 --> 1:45:52.080]  Now, as far as what I would recommend that the average person do
[1:45:52.080 --> 1:45:56.080]  with their money is pretty much what I'm doing with my own money,
[1:45:56.080 --> 1:46:00.080]  maybe tweaked a little bit depending on your risk tolerance.
[1:46:00.080 --> 1:46:04.080]  But I think the biggest risk out there, as you said,
[1:46:04.080 --> 1:46:08.080]  is the purchasing power of the US dollar, massive inflation,
[1:46:08.080 --> 1:46:13.080]  inflation is now the primary source of revenue for the US government.
[1:46:13.080 --> 1:46:17.080]  It's not tax and spend. It's not even really borrow and spend.
[1:46:17.080 --> 1:46:20.080]  It's inflate and spend. And inflate is printing money.
[1:46:20.080 --> 1:46:23.080]  The government creates money and just spends it.
[1:46:23.080 --> 1:46:26.080]  Well, when the government does that, we don't get all the spending for free.
[1:46:26.080 --> 1:46:30.080]  Inflation is just another government tax.
[1:46:30.080 --> 1:46:34.080]  The tax makes your money worth less, and so now everything you want to buy
[1:46:34.080 --> 1:46:38.080]  is possible. What they're asking is they respect you.
[1:46:38.080 --> 1:46:40.080]  You've got a good track record, an excellent one.
[1:46:40.080 --> 1:46:43.080]  How much more inflated are we than YMAR?
[1:46:43.080 --> 1:46:46.080]  It seems like a lot more, but how are they hiding in a lot more?
[1:46:46.080 --> 1:46:48.080]  Because some things are really spiked up.
[1:46:48.080 --> 1:46:50.080]  Luxury goods are richer buying that.
[1:46:50.080 --> 1:46:52.080]  But for other areas, it's gone up some, but not as much as it should.
[1:46:52.080 --> 1:46:55.080]  I mean, my goodness, the amount of printing and spending
[1:46:55.080 --> 1:46:58.080]  and just disgorging by all these major countries and groups
[1:46:58.080 --> 1:47:01.080]  and the amount of derivatives continuing on.
[1:47:01.080 --> 1:47:05.080]  Does anybody know any ballpark? How many quadrillions this is?
[1:47:05.080 --> 1:47:10.080]  Well, we haven't inflated to the YMAR Republic level yet.
[1:47:10.080 --> 1:47:12.080]  That doesn't mean we may not get there.
[1:47:12.080 --> 1:47:18.080]  But you have to understand what caused the YMAR Republic to inflate.
[1:47:18.080 --> 1:47:22.080]  It was their external debt that resulted from the Treaty of Versailles
[1:47:22.080 --> 1:47:28.080]  and World War I. So all of a sudden, Germany had a lot of debt that they had to pay.
[1:47:28.080 --> 1:47:32.080]  And they really didn't have the resources to pay it, so they printed money.
[1:47:32.080 --> 1:47:33.080]  And that's what went on.
[1:47:33.080 --> 1:47:38.080]  Well, if you look at how much debt the United States has relative to the size of our economy,
[1:47:38.080 --> 1:47:41.080]  we're more indebted than was the YMAR Republic.
[1:47:41.080 --> 1:47:43.080]  So we have a bigger problem.
[1:47:43.080 --> 1:47:48.080]  And if we turn to the same type of finance and it looks like that's where we're going,
[1:47:48.080 --> 1:47:50.080]  we can wipe out our currency too.
[1:47:50.080 --> 1:47:54.080]  The difference is Germany didn't issue the world's reserve currency.
[1:47:54.080 --> 1:47:57.080]  Back in during the YMAR days, the world was still on a gold standard.
[1:47:57.080 --> 1:48:01.080]  Now, those marks, those rice marks weren't backed by gold.
[1:48:01.080 --> 1:48:03.080]  And that's what enabled all the printing.
[1:48:03.080 --> 1:48:06.080]  Well, the dollar isn't backed by anything either.
[1:48:06.080 --> 1:48:09.080]  But right now, the dollar has been the reserve currency.
[1:48:09.080 --> 1:48:12.080]  And therefore, we've been able to print a lot more and get away with it
[1:48:12.080 --> 1:48:16.080]  because all of our trading partners are willing to hold on to the paper we print
[1:48:16.080 --> 1:48:19.080]  and then supply us with all the goods that we consume.
[1:48:19.080 --> 1:48:22.080]  My thesis is that's coming to an end.
[1:48:22.080 --> 1:48:25.080]  We're not going to be able to get away with writing checks that nobody bothers about.
[1:48:25.080 --> 1:48:28.080]  I agree. Obviously, it's going to come to an end.
[1:48:28.080 --> 1:48:31.080]  And as you said, there seems to be a giving up.
[1:48:31.080 --> 1:48:34.080]  Republicans and Democrats are just accepting that this is all coming.
[1:48:34.080 --> 1:48:37.080]  They just hope to move it down the road, kick the can.
[1:48:37.080 --> 1:48:39.080]  Well, that's all they've ever cared about.
[1:48:39.080 --> 1:48:41.080]  That's the problem with politicians.
[1:48:41.080 --> 1:48:46.080]  That's why I had hoped initially that Trump would rise above that and be a statesman.
[1:48:46.080 --> 1:48:50.080]  But instead, he kicked the can maybe further than anybody.
[1:48:50.080 --> 1:48:54.080]  But everybody just tries to get to the next election.
[1:48:54.080 --> 1:48:57.080]  Nobody wants to be the bearer of bad news, right?
[1:48:57.080 --> 1:48:58.080]  No one wants to be the messenger.
[1:48:58.080 --> 1:49:03.080]  They get shot for delivering the truth to the American public about the gravity of the problems
[1:49:03.080 --> 1:49:06.080]  that governments in the past have created.
[1:49:06.080 --> 1:49:09.080]  So no government of the present wants to deal with it.
[1:49:09.080 --> 1:49:14.080]  So they want to kick it down the road so that some government of the future has to deal with it.
[1:49:14.080 --> 1:49:16.080]  But that brings me to this question.
[1:49:16.080 --> 1:49:17.080]  Great reset.
[1:49:17.080 --> 1:49:22.080]  Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates say we're going to shut the economy down, claim COVID causes a collapse
[1:49:22.080 --> 1:49:25.080]  so the public doesn't blame governments for this big reset.
[1:49:25.080 --> 1:49:30.080]  So it seems like that's their solution is they're maneuvering us in to this global collapse,
[1:49:30.080 --> 1:49:32.080]  but they're going to claim COVID caused it.
[1:49:32.080 --> 1:49:36.080]  Yeah, look, the government always wants to scapegoat for all the problems.
[1:49:36.080 --> 1:49:41.080]  And COVID is the perfect scapegoat because after all, it's nobody's fault, right?
[1:49:41.080 --> 1:49:46.080]  Every time they talk about COVID and all the problems, it's through no fault of their own, you know?
[1:49:46.080 --> 1:49:51.080]  And so therefore the government has to help people who are in trouble for no fault of their own, you know?
[1:49:51.080 --> 1:49:54.080]  And now everybody feels that they have an excuse.
[1:49:54.080 --> 1:49:57.080]  In fact, now we've manufactured an excuse.
[1:49:57.080 --> 1:49:58.080]  Look what Biden said.
[1:49:58.080 --> 1:50:05.080]  Hey, if your boss wants you to come back to work and you turn down the job, you still get unemployment.
[1:50:05.080 --> 1:50:11.080]  In fact, you can actually make more money being unemployed than you used to make when you had a job.
[1:50:11.080 --> 1:50:14.080]  All you have to do is say, I don't want to risk getting COVID.
[1:50:14.080 --> 1:50:19.080]  I mean, so we have really opened up a Pandora's box here and I don't know how to close it.
[1:50:19.080 --> 1:50:22.080]  And everybody, again, thinks they're going to get something for nothing.
[1:50:22.080 --> 1:50:30.080]  So getting back to what to do with your money, get out of U.S. dollars, buy some physical silver, you know, buy some gold, buy foreign stocks.
[1:50:30.080 --> 1:50:37.080]  If you have a larger portfolio, do what I'm doing with my own money, what I'm doing with my clients that you're a Pacific asset management,
[1:50:37.080 --> 1:50:45.080]  which is getting into good value foreign businesses through the stock market, buying good companies abroad that have good assets,
[1:50:45.080 --> 1:50:51.080]  that have, you know, that have good income and pay good dividends and certain places that aren't overvalued yet.
[1:50:51.080 --> 1:51:00.080]  Yes, stocks that aren't overvalued, but in countries that don't have the type of problem that the United States has that haven't been living beyond their means,
[1:51:00.080 --> 1:51:02.080]  that have, you know, balanced budgets.
[1:51:02.080 --> 1:51:07.080]  No, hey, listen, I'm out of time, but I personally want to talk to you so hopefully we can talk the next couple of days.
[1:51:07.080 --> 1:51:09.080]  Peter Schiff, thank you so much for the time.
[1:51:09.080 --> 1:51:11.080]  Schiff Gold, thank you so much.
[1:51:11.080 --> 1:51:13.080]  All right, my pleasure.
[1:51:13.080 --> 1:51:15.080]  Well, that was a powerful interview.
[1:51:15.080 --> 1:51:17.080]  Wow, we got Robert Barnes coming up.
[1:51:17.080 --> 1:51:20.080]  He's actually a lawyer for Trump, and they're working on this whole impeachment situation.
[1:51:20.080 --> 1:51:23.080]  He's going to be on with us to talk about this nightmare starting next week.
[1:51:23.080 --> 1:51:28.080]  I'm right at the center of it, trying to say I wanted this to happen, even though I'm there trying to stop the riot that ensued.
[1:51:28.080 --> 1:51:33.080]  Or, you know, like Schiff said, it was kind of like a football game or small riot or whatever.
[1:51:33.080 --> 1:51:36.080]  They're turning into the ultimate Pearl Harbor, the ultimate war separately.
[1:51:36.080 --> 1:51:38.080]  Look at these products right here.
[1:51:38.080 --> 1:51:46.080]  DNA Force Plus, ladies and gentlemen, is about to sell out as PQQ, CoQ10, so good for your cells, the ultimate thing for your immune system.
[1:51:46.080 --> 1:51:50.080]  Adults, children, everybody can take it, but it's really for people over 40, but kids can safely take it.
[1:51:50.080 --> 1:51:52.080]  It is out right now.
[1:51:52.080 --> 1:51:55.080]  Discount, even though it's going to sell out, it won't be in for months.
[1:51:55.080 --> 1:52:00.080]  We also have Ultra 12, super high quality vitamin B12, take it under the tongue.
[1:52:00.080 --> 1:52:03.080]  I just got a big shipment to this end, so it's 50 percent off.
[1:52:03.080 --> 1:52:07.080]  It's going to sell out quickly, though, so I'm going to keep it at that price till it sells out,
[1:52:07.080 --> 1:52:09.080]  just like I did with vitamin refusion.
[1:52:09.080 --> 1:52:11.080]  We also have lung cleanse back in stock.
[1:52:11.080 --> 1:52:13.080]  So good for your mouth, your throat, your lungs.

[1:52:16.080 --> 1:52:17.080]  Infowarstore.com.
[1:52:17.080 --> 1:52:24.080]  We sold out a body's ultimate turmeric formula, but we have the liquid version that's also a super strong curcuminoid extract.
[1:52:24.080 --> 1:52:26.080]  Same company we got it from made this.
[1:52:26.080 --> 1:52:27.080]  It's just a liquid version.
[1:52:27.080 --> 1:52:29.080]  It's running out, but still discounted.
[1:52:29.080 --> 1:52:30.080]  Infowarstore.com.
[1:52:30.080 --> 1:52:32.080]  And that's how we fund our operation.
[1:52:32.080 --> 1:52:34.080]  Get a book, get a t-shirt, get a wonderful treasure.
[1:52:34.080 --> 1:52:35.080]  Thank you all for your support.
[1:52:35.080 --> 1:52:36.080]  Keep us on the air in this critical time.
[1:52:36.080 --> 1:52:41.080]  We'll be back with our number three, three, three, three, three.
[1:52:41.080 --> 1:52:42.080]  Hey, Alex.
[1:52:42.080 --> 1:52:43.080]  How you doing, man?
[1:52:43.080 --> 1:52:46.080]  Is this the guy that called in about Living Defense?
[1:52:46.080 --> 1:52:47.080]  Yes, sir.
[1:52:47.080 --> 1:52:48.080]  Yes, sir.
[1:52:48.080 --> 1:52:55.080]  I've been trying to get a hold of you since Monday when I heard you got that fresh shipment of Living Defense in from Utah.
[1:52:55.080 --> 1:52:58.080]  I said, man, I got to get on that show and give him an update.
[1:52:58.080 --> 1:53:07.080]  I said, if I ever get a chance to be on Alex Jones show, I'm going to tell the world about Living Defense and what it did for me personally.
[1:53:07.080 --> 1:53:13.080]  Now look, I'm 64 years old going on 20 thanks to this Infowarstore product.
[1:53:13.080 --> 1:53:16.080]  And by the way, I bought $800 worth the other night.
[1:53:16.080 --> 1:53:19.080]  So I'm doing what I can, brother.
[1:53:19.080 --> 1:53:26.080]  So what my contention is, why don't we start this new year off right with everybody getting a couple bottles of Living Defense.
[1:53:26.080 --> 1:53:29.080]  Now you got to follow that up with the micro-VS.
[1:53:29.080 --> 1:53:30.080]  I learned that.
[1:53:30.080 --> 1:53:33.080]  So it's like God working is so amazing.
[1:53:33.080 --> 1:53:34.080]  We didn't know.
[1:53:34.080 --> 1:53:35.080]  We didn't screen your call.
[1:53:35.080 --> 1:53:36.080]  We had no idea.
[1:53:36.080 --> 1:53:39.080]  And I go to you a year later and you're here telling people about Living Defense.
[1:53:39.080 --> 1:53:40.080]  Living Defense.
[1:53:40.080 --> 1:53:41.080]  Living Defense.
[1:53:42.080 --> 1:53:44.080]  You must guard your humanity.
[1:53:44.080 --> 1:53:47.080]  You must guard your children's humanity.
[1:53:47.080 --> 1:53:50.080]  You must guard the very genetic code of the planet.
[1:53:50.080 --> 1:53:59.080]  The globalists have set themselves up as the guardians of this world, but they are the ones that are overriding every genetic system and poisoning the planet.
[1:53:59.080 --> 1:54:06.080]  They are the ones that are now engaged in genetic takeover of every human on Earth to the GMO crops.
[1:54:06.080 --> 1:54:13.080]  And now they've moved on to their main target, humanity with the mRNA vaccines, which are not vaccines.
[1:54:13.080 --> 1:54:24.080]  They are recombinant DNA from aborted cloned fetuses, which are then inserted into your genome to take over your body's systems.
[1:54:24.080 --> 1:54:31.080]  Go read the actual inserts for the mRNA vaccines and then remember you've been warned.
[1:54:31.080 --> 1:54:34.080]  This is the equivalent of an alien takeover.
[1:54:34.080 --> 1:54:40.080]  Whether it's interdimensional, whether it's little green men, the globalists are acting like another species that's overtaking us and overriding us.
[1:54:40.080 --> 1:54:44.080]  It's all the same in the end.
[1:54:44.080 --> 1:54:48.080]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:54:58.080 --> 1:55:00.080]  All right, Robert Barnes to only do 30 minutes.
[1:55:00.080 --> 1:55:02.080]  We're trying to get on the line right now.
[1:55:02.080 --> 1:55:10.080]  Smart constitutional lawyer, great historian, worked during the last few months of the whole situation with the election fraud.
[1:55:10.080 --> 1:55:11.080]  As soon as we get him on, we'll go to him.
[1:55:11.080 --> 1:55:13.080]  He'll only stay half an hour.
[1:55:13.080 --> 1:55:15.080]  And I do intend to take a lot of calls this week on some of the other shows.
[1:55:15.080 --> 1:55:17.080]  We do have some big guests coming up this week.
[1:55:17.080 --> 1:55:19.080]  I'll just leave it at that.
[1:55:19.080 --> 1:55:22.080]  I went into a whole hour long rant the first hour, though.
[1:55:22.080 --> 1:55:29.080]  And again, humans, I had a globalist explain this to me and I've told the story probably 500 times.
[1:55:29.080 --> 1:55:36.080]  I'm not going to tell it again, but I was on a first class flight to be on the view like 15 years ago.
[1:55:36.080 --> 1:55:38.080]  And I was like, I recognize you.
[1:55:38.080 --> 1:55:40.080]  He goes, yeah, I recognize you.
[1:55:40.080 --> 1:55:47.080]  And he goes, yeah, I'm the CEO of this bank.
[1:55:47.080 --> 1:55:49.080]  That's one of the big three banks.
[1:55:49.080 --> 1:55:54.080]  And I'm like, oh, yeah, we didn't talk about an hour in the next two hours flying to New York.
[1:55:54.080 --> 1:55:58.080]  He said, Jones, the soft record, right?
[1:55:58.080 --> 1:56:00.080]  He says, don't say who I am.
[1:56:00.080 --> 1:56:02.080]  And of course, you wonder how guys are like that.
[1:56:02.080 --> 1:56:03.080]  They know somebody like me.
[1:56:03.080 --> 1:56:07.080]  I don't do in confidence talks and then blow who they are.
[1:56:07.080 --> 1:56:14.080]  And he just says, Jones, they're going to adapt to being slaves.
[1:56:14.080 --> 1:56:17.080]  They're going to adapt to corporate world government being slaves.
[1:56:17.080 --> 1:56:19.080]  They're going to adapt to us running things.
[1:56:19.080 --> 1:56:21.080]  You don't get it because you understand all this.
[1:56:21.080 --> 1:56:23.080]  You should try to work with us.
[1:56:23.080 --> 1:56:28.080]  It's just like, it's the same attitude when I talked to Roscoe, head of the Kissinger group, trying to hire me.
[1:56:28.080 --> 1:56:30.080]  And there was a witness there and he didn't say it off record.
[1:56:30.080 --> 1:56:32.080]  So I can tell the story.
[1:56:32.080 --> 1:56:34.080]  He just said, Jones, come on.
[1:56:34.080 --> 1:56:36.080]  It's not going anywhere.
[1:56:36.080 --> 1:56:37.080]  Just give up.
[1:56:37.080 --> 1:56:40.080]  Join us.
[1:56:40.080 --> 1:56:43.080]  And that's what this is.
[1:56:43.080 --> 1:56:45.080]  And it's not like I'm up here like, oh, aren't I fancy?
[1:56:45.080 --> 1:56:46.080]  They've tried to hire me.
[1:56:46.080 --> 1:56:49.080]  They buy everybody off.
[1:56:49.080 --> 1:56:57.080]  And now you see the nightmare world we're going towards because people have agreed to this and people have gone along with this.
[1:56:57.080 --> 1:56:59.080]  And now they say, oh, we're not just going to live forever.
[1:56:59.080 --> 1:57:01.080]  We're going to get rid of humans and emerge with machines.
[1:57:01.080 --> 1:57:04.080]  It's insanity.
[1:57:04.080 --> 1:57:13.080]  And yeah, the public is jealous and dumbed down and lazy because freedom created so much wealth that a lot of people are busting their ass.
[1:57:13.080 --> 1:57:22.080]  And it's those good people that are keeping the country and the world going as the globalists trying to starve the third world to death.
[1:57:22.080 --> 1:57:27.080]  And so all I'm saying is the globalists that claim they're better than everybody are the worst of our people.
[1:57:27.080 --> 1:57:30.080]  And they don't have any right to sit there and claim their gods.
[1:57:30.080 --> 1:57:38.080]  They're doing all this for the greater good under some social Darwinistic precept that they have a right to do this because they're in charge.
[1:57:38.080 --> 1:57:40.080]  It's classic dictator behavior.
[1:57:40.080 --> 1:57:44.080]  It's snakes of death and failure.
[1:57:44.080 --> 1:57:48.080]  And now I don't dislike the public.
[1:57:48.080 --> 1:57:53.080]  I don't even get mad at the public because I get there in trance.
[1:57:53.080 --> 1:57:55.080]  But I have mourning.
[1:57:55.080 --> 1:57:59.080]  I'm mourning and I've learned how to mourn now better than I ever had.
[1:57:59.080 --> 1:58:01.080]  I learned just to accept family dying.
[1:58:01.080 --> 1:58:03.080]  I've learned how to accept evil.
[1:58:03.080 --> 1:58:05.080]  I don't go along with it.
[1:58:05.080 --> 1:58:09.080]  I just cannot physically, psychically take all the pain on.
[1:58:09.080 --> 1:58:12.080]  And so God has given me peace to a certain extent.
[1:58:12.080 --> 1:58:17.080]  You got to be careful about it then, though, because then you could just cut people off like that.
[1:58:17.080 --> 1:58:20.080]  So what I'm saying is I'm not becoming a sociopath.
[1:58:20.080 --> 1:58:22.080]  It's the opposite.
[1:58:22.080 --> 1:58:28.080]  I've learned when this is so painful that I just have to give it to God.
[1:58:28.080 --> 1:58:29.080]  So it's like a filter.
[1:58:29.080 --> 1:58:31.080]  I still feel 10% of the pain.
[1:58:31.080 --> 1:58:34.080]  But as I accept more reality and learn more, the pain level goes way up.
[1:58:34.080 --> 1:58:39.080]  So the pain level I'm feeling psychically is more than most people can handle.
[1:58:39.080 --> 1:58:44.080]  And I'm not my own personal experience, but it's extremely like living in a pain induction chamber.
[1:58:44.080 --> 1:58:49.080]  The thing about it, though, having empathy and then still facing the evil, which most people can't do, is
[1:58:49.080 --> 1:58:55.080]  then your discernment and your psychic abilities just jack off the charts,
[1:58:55.080 --> 1:58:58.080]  which then again causes more understanding.
[1:58:58.080 --> 1:59:01.080]  The Bible says, with knowledge comes great suffering.
[1:59:01.080 --> 1:59:04.080]  With knowledge comes great pain.
[1:59:04.080 --> 1:59:07.080]  And it's true, but there's an ecstasy in the pain.
[1:59:07.080 --> 1:59:10.080]  And I'm not saying that in a masochistic way.
[1:59:10.080 --> 1:59:12.080]  It's just that I know I'm for real.
[1:59:12.080 --> 1:59:13.080]  I know how to get out of this.
[1:59:13.080 --> 1:59:14.080]  I know God's real.
[1:59:14.080 --> 1:59:20.080]  And I sit there and I watch people engage in lies and engage in evil and engage in corruption.
[1:59:20.080 --> 1:59:22.080]  It levels the world's never seen before.
[1:59:22.080 --> 1:59:24.080]  And it's just you want to save them.
[1:59:24.080 --> 1:59:26.080]  And the sociopaths are like, don't save them.
[1:59:26.080 --> 1:59:27.080]  Feed on them.
[1:59:27.080 --> 1:59:29.080]  And I'm like, I can't do that and lose my soul.
[1:59:29.080 --> 1:59:32.080]  But then it becomes a paradox where now they've done the mass downward.
[1:59:32.080 --> 1:59:37.080]  It's an army that'll destroy you like lemmings or stampeding cows over a cliff.
[1:59:37.080 --> 1:59:41.080]  And so you at some point are stuck between the globalist and the masses.
[1:59:41.080 --> 1:59:45.080]  And what do you do back in 60 seconds with Robert Barnes?
[1:59:53.080 --> 1:59:55.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've studied history.
[1:59:55.080 --> 1:59:56.080]  I've interviewed all the experts.
[1:59:56.080 --> 1:59:59.080]  I have looked at every facet of this.
[1:59:59.080 --> 2:00:04.080]  And now only days until the inauguration of the Chai-Kam agent, it's all coming into place.
[2:00:04.080 --> 2:00:07.080]  That's how they change the subject from election fraud.
[2:00:07.080 --> 2:00:09.080]  It's how they change the subject from Hunter's laptop.
[2:00:09.080 --> 2:00:15.080]  It's how they change the subject from Epstein and Obama and Al Qaeda and the New World Order.
[2:00:15.080 --> 2:00:20.080]  And now use the already martial law in place for COVID-19.
[2:00:20.080 --> 2:00:25.080]  And that's what it is to then be expanded and become political and become permanent.
[2:00:25.080 --> 2:00:26.080]  They train you to stay in your houses.
[2:00:26.080 --> 2:00:27.080]  They train you to be tracked.
[2:00:27.080 --> 2:00:30.080]  They train and do what you're told for nine, ten months as training wheels.
[2:00:30.080 --> 2:00:32.080]  And now they launch the storm.
[2:00:32.080 --> 2:00:34.080]  The storm is here.
[2:00:34.080 --> 2:00:36.080]  It's a globalist storm.
[2:00:36.080 --> 2:00:38.080]  There's not going to be martial law for Trump.
[2:00:38.080 --> 2:00:40.080]  There's to be martial law for the globalist.
[2:00:40.080 --> 2:00:42.080]  They're trying to set you up.
[2:00:42.080 --> 2:00:43.080]  Don't be involved in violence.
[2:00:43.080 --> 2:00:47.080]  Expose the New World Order and expose the takeover with information.
[2:00:47.080 --> 2:00:57.080]  That's how we beat these people with truth.
[2:01:18.080 --> 2:01:19.080]  It's not my point of view.
[2:01:19.080 --> 2:01:24.080]  It's a fact.
[2:01:24.080 --> 2:01:25.080]  There's only one way to fight Terry.
[2:01:25.080 --> 2:01:29.080]  And that's by waking up and committing to humanity and standing up against evil.
[2:01:29.080 --> 2:01:34.080]  And then you find your spiritual muscles just explode.
[2:01:34.080 --> 2:01:35.080]  All right.
[2:01:35.080 --> 2:01:36.080]  We only got in for two segments.
[2:01:36.080 --> 2:01:39.080]  Robert Barnes, one of the top constitutional lawyers in the country,
[2:01:39.080 --> 2:01:42.080]  worked closely with Trump trying to battle election fraud,
[2:01:42.080 --> 2:01:44.080]  called the shots exactly as they unfolded,
[2:01:44.080 --> 2:01:47.080]  warned about the Q delusion.
[2:01:47.080 --> 2:01:50.080]  And now he's here with us to talk about this upcoming trial next week.
[2:01:50.080 --> 2:01:52.080]  What's going to unfold?
[2:01:52.080 --> 2:01:55.080]  What the inside scoop is on what Trump's defense is.
[2:01:55.080 --> 2:01:57.080]  Problems that Trump may encounter.
[2:01:57.080 --> 2:01:59.080]  Should he bring up election fraud?
[2:01:59.080 --> 2:02:00.080]  Does that even matter?
[2:02:00.080 --> 2:02:03.080]  Does he go with a long trial or just a very limited to kill it?
[2:02:03.080 --> 2:02:05.080]  Why isn't the Supreme Court justice leading it?
[2:02:05.080 --> 2:02:09.080]  I know that Ivan Raiklin, his lawyer, sent me a thing pointing out
[2:02:09.080 --> 2:02:13.080]  that the Constitution says you got to be the president to be under trial
[2:02:13.080 --> 2:02:16.080]  so that he says, oh, look, they certified him as the president.
[2:02:16.080 --> 2:02:18.080]  I mean, I get that that's a technicality,
[2:02:18.080 --> 2:02:20.080]  but it's kind of a Q-ish type deal.
[2:02:20.080 --> 2:02:22.080]  I'm not saying Raiklin's wrong to raise it.
[2:02:22.080 --> 2:02:23.080]  It's an interesting point.
[2:02:23.080 --> 2:02:26.080]  So I'm going to just shut up and give you the floor about this.
[2:02:26.080 --> 2:02:29.080]  But fascist thugs, Democrats are already threatening to destroy
[2:02:29.080 --> 2:02:32.080]  President Trump's new impeachment lawyers.
[2:02:32.080 --> 2:02:33.080]  That's how they keep getting him to quit.
[2:02:33.080 --> 2:02:36.080]  Trump names defense lawyers historic trial looms.
[2:02:36.080 --> 2:02:42.080]  Even Barnes admitting he worked with Trump is putting a giant target on his head.
[2:02:42.080 --> 2:02:46.080]  So joining us now is Robert Barnes of Barnes Law.
[2:02:46.080 --> 2:02:48.080]  So go ahead, my friend.
[2:02:48.080 --> 2:02:49.080]  Yeah, I mean, there's no question.
[2:02:49.080 --> 2:02:53.080]  I think the president's made the right choice to not do the Lindsey Graham
[2:02:53.080 --> 2:02:56.080]  defense, which was going to be very limited because the other lawyers
[2:02:56.080 --> 2:03:00.080]  involved that are now no longer involved that he replaced this week,
[2:03:00.080 --> 2:03:03.080]  that he replaced on Saturday and Sunday.
[2:03:03.080 --> 2:03:06.080]  Those lawyers were picked handpicked by Lindsey Graham.
[2:03:06.080 --> 2:03:07.080]  They're from South Carolina.
[2:03:07.080 --> 2:03:08.080]  Yeah, he worked two weeks ago.
[2:03:08.080 --> 2:03:10.080]  It was a terrible choice.
[2:03:10.080 --> 2:03:14.080]  Yeah, because these are lawyers who don't want to present the full leverage
[2:03:14.080 --> 2:03:16.080]  of the president's defense.
[2:03:16.080 --> 2:03:17.080]  And there's two aspects of this.
[2:03:17.080 --> 2:03:22.080]  One is the actual substance of defense and what the president can say he's going
[2:03:22.080 --> 2:03:26.080]  to use as part of his defense as leverage to get the Senate to reconsider
[2:03:26.080 --> 2:03:30.080]  even going through with this trial because there's already talk in the
[2:03:30.080 --> 2:03:35.080]  Senate of dropping the trial and simply doing a sensor, you know,
[2:03:35.080 --> 2:03:36.080]  some sort of sensor.
[2:03:36.080 --> 2:03:37.080]  And that's it.
[2:03:37.080 --> 2:03:41.080]  So what we'll say that we will censor you will say you were wrong,
[2:03:41.080 --> 2:03:45.080]  but we're not going to go through the rigmarole of a trial that the outcome
[2:03:45.080 --> 2:03:49.080]  we all know will not be conviction will not be removal.
[2:03:49.080 --> 2:03:54.080]  Now they are trying to explore the 14th Amendment section three as an alternative
[2:03:54.080 --> 2:03:58.080]  mechanism to by majority vote bar people from office.
[2:03:58.080 --> 2:04:00.080]  They're even talking about doing that with congressman.
[2:04:00.080 --> 2:04:03.080]  But at this point, there isn't enough support for that to happen.
[2:04:03.080 --> 2:04:05.080]  And constitutionally, that's very dubious.
[2:04:05.080 --> 2:04:08.080]  The president's potential defenses and what he wants is he wants all of his
[2:04:08.080 --> 2:04:11.080]  quivers available to him.
[2:04:11.080 --> 2:04:14.080]  And then he can decide once next week comes around which ones to actually
[2:04:14.080 --> 2:04:18.080]  utilize, but at least have the threat of them in order to have leverage during
[2:04:18.080 --> 2:04:20.080]  this negotiation stage this week.
[2:04:20.080 --> 2:04:25.080]  And that includes not only defending against the unconstitutionality of the
[2:04:25.080 --> 2:04:29.080]  impeachment, which it goes beyond the fact that there is no right to impeach
[2:04:29.080 --> 2:04:34.080]  someone or convict someone or punish someone who's not an existing officer.
[2:04:34.080 --> 2:04:36.080]  That's problem one, problem two.
[2:04:36.080 --> 2:04:37.080]  So that's the question.
[2:04:37.080 --> 2:04:40.080]  Is Trump even accepting and going to this, opting into a fraud?
[2:04:40.080 --> 2:04:43.080]  I mean, as Dershowitz points out, I can read the constitution.
[2:04:43.080 --> 2:04:44.080]  I'm not a lawyer.
[2:04:44.080 --> 2:04:46.080]  It's crystal clear that he's a private citizen.
[2:04:46.080 --> 2:04:47.080]  They shouldn't be able to do this.
[2:04:47.080 --> 2:04:50.080]  Is that why John Roberts refuses to be part of it?
[2:04:50.080 --> 2:04:52.080]  Is that why Leahy is being rolled up there?
[2:04:52.080 --> 2:04:53.080]  I mean, what is this?
[2:04:53.080 --> 2:04:55.080]  Well, it's a shame is what it is.
[2:04:55.080 --> 2:04:59.080]  Because so Roberts recognized that only an existing officer can be impeached
[2:04:59.080 --> 2:05:04.080]  because if, in fact, it was the president being impeached, then Roberts constitutionally
[2:05:04.080 --> 2:05:06.080]  had to appear for this trial.
[2:05:06.080 --> 2:05:09.080]  And that would certify that Trump was still the president.
[2:05:09.080 --> 2:05:11.080]  I mean, if he did that.
[2:05:11.080 --> 2:05:12.080]  Exactly.
[2:05:12.080 --> 2:05:15.080]  And so they were rejecting that that was, of course, the case.
[2:05:15.080 --> 2:05:17.080]  And so that's why Roberts is not there.
[2:05:17.080 --> 2:05:24.080]  And there is no constitutional provision to have the sitting a senator act as both
[2:05:24.080 --> 2:05:27.080]  juror and judge in an impeachment case, which is what Leahy is.
[2:05:27.080 --> 2:05:30.080]  So that's a second constitutional problem.
[2:05:30.080 --> 2:05:32.080]  Oh, I didn't think of that.
[2:05:32.080 --> 2:05:34.080]  He's a juror and a judge.
[2:05:34.080 --> 2:05:37.080]  What article the bill of rights has that violated?
[2:05:37.080 --> 2:05:38.080]  What seven or?
[2:05:38.080 --> 2:05:40.080]  I mean, several different ones.
[2:05:40.080 --> 2:05:44.080]  But primarily the reason why the impeachment clause itself gives the impeachment clause
[2:05:44.080 --> 2:05:49.080]  itself says if the president is being tried, then the chief justice of the Supreme Court
[2:05:49.080 --> 2:05:50.080]  has to preside.
[2:05:50.080 --> 2:05:54.080]  If he refuses to preside, that means you have an unconstitutional trial from the get go,
[2:05:54.080 --> 2:05:56.080]  which is what is already the case.
[2:05:56.080 --> 2:06:00.080]  It's an unconstitutional bill of attainder because it's a private citizen being punished
[2:06:00.080 --> 2:06:04.080]  by the Senate, which they don't have a right to do under the bill of attaining provisions.
[2:06:04.080 --> 2:06:08.080]  It is in addition to that a violation of the First and Fifth Amendment to the U.S.
[2:06:08.080 --> 2:06:11.080]  Constitution because the president is being punished for his speech.
[2:06:11.080 --> 2:06:14.080]  There was no illicit criminal incitement that took place here.
[2:06:14.080 --> 2:06:16.080]  No true threat that took place here.
[2:06:16.080 --> 2:06:18.080]  It's a patent violation of the First Amendment.
[2:06:18.080 --> 2:06:22.080]  It's a Fifth Amendment violation because no due process was allowed during the impeachment
[2:06:22.080 --> 2:06:25.080]  stage of the case, nor apparently going on here.
[2:06:25.080 --> 2:06:30.080]  So, there was an argument that Dershowitz-Turley and others made that Trump should treat it
[2:06:30.080 --> 2:06:32.080]  as a joke and not even show up.
[2:06:32.080 --> 2:06:37.080]  The counter to that was to use it as an opportunity to present arguments because he can always
[2:06:37.080 --> 2:06:41.080]  challenge this after the trial in the courts if he wants to.
[2:06:41.080 --> 2:06:46.080]  The additional things he can challenge, aside from the complete illegality of what took place,
[2:06:46.080 --> 2:06:50.080]  is expose the hypocrite, put the House and the Senate on trial.
[2:06:50.080 --> 2:06:54.080]  Not only the unconstitutional nature of these proceedings, but the degree to which the reason
[2:06:54.080 --> 2:07:00.080]  why what happened on January 6th happened, if anyone is to be blamed, it's a combination
[2:07:00.080 --> 2:07:04.080]  of whatever happened at the seventh floor of the FBI that misled Capitol Police into
[2:07:04.080 --> 2:07:08.080]  what happened that day, whatever was really going on with QAnon and whether or not it was
[2:07:08.080 --> 2:07:14.080]  in fact a government psi-off by dissident members of the deep state against the president,
[2:07:14.080 --> 2:07:19.080]  whether or not Senator McConnell and Speaker Paul Pelosi had advanced notice of risk and
[2:07:19.080 --> 2:07:24.080]  deliberately took steps to prevent knowledge of that risk from being given to the Capitol
[2:07:24.080 --> 2:07:27.080]  Police and to their fellow Congress members and senators.
[2:07:27.080 --> 2:07:30.080]  So he can go pursue those a pass.
[2:07:30.080 --> 2:07:31.080]  Well, let me ask you this.
[2:07:31.080 --> 2:07:32.080]  Let me hear what you have to say in the limited time.
[2:07:32.080 --> 2:07:34.080]  I wish you could stay longer.
[2:07:34.080 --> 2:07:40.080]  What about him going in and showing hours of footage of Pelosi and Maxine Waters and Democrats
[2:07:40.080 --> 2:07:44.080]  and all of them saying kill Trump, attack people, burn things down?
[2:07:44.080 --> 2:07:50.080]  It's just what people do, BLM are heroes, anti-fury heroes, and then show him saying
[2:07:50.080 --> 2:07:52.080]  don't be violent, peaceful protest.
[2:07:52.080 --> 2:07:53.080]  I mean, it's open and shut.
[2:07:53.080 --> 2:07:57.080]  You show them all calling for 50 times what he did, and then you show what he actually
[2:07:57.080 --> 2:07:58.080]  said that day to me.
[2:07:58.080 --> 2:08:02.080]  I mean, he just goes on the offense and absolutely throttles them with that.
[2:08:02.080 --> 2:08:05.080]  Yeah, that's the other aspect where you put them on trial.
[2:08:05.080 --> 2:08:09.080]  You put them on trial because also the reason why did people think they could do what they
[2:08:09.080 --> 2:08:12.080]  could do on the sixth, because they had been witnessing it all summer.
[2:08:12.080 --> 2:08:14.080]  They'd been witnessing it for four years.
[2:08:14.080 --> 2:08:18.080]  They'd witnessed the media greenlight it, and they had witnessed the politicians greenlight.
[2:08:18.080 --> 2:08:20.080]  What's good for the goose is good for the gander.
[2:08:20.080 --> 2:08:21.080]  They're the ones that opened up the attack.
[2:08:21.080 --> 2:08:22.080]  They drew first blood.
[2:08:22.080 --> 2:08:24.080]  We're not defending the violence.
[2:08:24.080 --> 2:08:28.080]  We're just saying you can't open a war up and say it's good, and then bitch when somebody
[2:08:28.080 --> 2:08:29.080]  else fights back.
[2:08:29.080 --> 2:08:30.080]  And you're precisely right.
[2:08:30.080 --> 2:08:32.080]  What he should do is contrast it.
[2:08:32.080 --> 2:08:37.080]  Put up a video presentation that has Trump saying peaceful and patriotic protest, and
[2:08:37.080 --> 2:08:41.080]  then whatever other bad democratic statement there is, and then do them all that way.
[2:08:41.080 --> 2:08:45.080]  So do Eric Holder talking about kicking them when they're down, the former attorney general,
[2:08:45.080 --> 2:08:49.080]  then contrast that with Trump saying peaceful and patriotic protest.
[2:08:49.080 --> 2:08:53.080]  Do Maxine Waters, then contrast it to Trump saying peaceful patriotic protest.
[2:08:53.080 --> 2:08:57.080]  Do Nancy Pelosi, then contrast it with peaceful patriotic protest.
[2:08:57.080 --> 2:09:03.080]  And on top of that, do comparisons of what BLM was doing with Kamala Harris, now the vice
[2:09:03.080 --> 2:09:08.080]  president, organizing bail funds for people that committed a real insurrection in Minnesota
[2:09:08.080 --> 2:09:10.080]  in Minneapolis over the summer.
[2:09:10.080 --> 2:09:14.080]  Hundreds of burn buildings, people shot, and she's saying it's good.
[2:09:14.080 --> 2:09:19.080]  He and she's working with a group doing the bail, which shows her as a capo or a dawn
[2:09:19.080 --> 2:09:21.080]  running a criminal enterprise.
[2:09:21.080 --> 2:09:22.080]  Exactly.
[2:09:22.080 --> 2:09:26.080]  And encouraging them to get right back out and encouraging people to continue to do it.
[2:09:26.080 --> 2:09:29.080]  Show the different statements that Biden has made in this respect.
[2:09:29.080 --> 2:09:35.080]  So just do all of the high ranking Democrats and the horrendous consequences of their actions
[2:09:35.080 --> 2:09:40.080]  and keep contrasting it with Trump's words, peaceful and patriotic protest, peaceful and
[2:09:40.080 --> 2:09:43.080]  patriotic protest, peaceful and patriotic protest.
[2:09:43.080 --> 2:09:49.080]  And that would also put the House in the Senate on trial and show the laughable political
[2:09:49.080 --> 2:09:50.080]  absurdity of it.
[2:09:50.080 --> 2:09:51.080]  I agree.
[2:09:51.080 --> 2:09:55.080]  What about bringing the president himself in with all of his gravitas and stage appeal?
[2:09:55.080 --> 2:10:00.080]  I mean, to literally have you no decency like the McCarthy hearings, get in their face
[2:10:00.080 --> 2:10:03.080]  instead of being on defense, go on offense.
[2:10:03.080 --> 2:10:07.080]  Where you would use him, if you're going to use him in that capacity as a speech, you
[2:10:07.080 --> 2:10:12.080]  don't want him to be subject to sworn testimony because that will just be a perjury trap.
[2:10:12.080 --> 2:10:15.080]  So if he does it, just do as a closing argument.
[2:10:15.080 --> 2:10:16.080]  A statement.
[2:10:16.080 --> 2:10:17.080]  The president himself making that closing argument.
[2:10:17.080 --> 2:10:19.080]  So he'd make a final statement.
[2:10:19.080 --> 2:10:20.080]  Exactly.
[2:10:20.080 --> 2:10:21.080]  Exactly.
[2:10:21.080 --> 2:10:25.080]  Like a witness statement in a case, like a closing argument that's traditionally given
[2:10:25.080 --> 2:10:26.080]  in a trial.
[2:10:26.080 --> 2:10:30.080]  And that could be the way in which he could impeach the impeachment because the impeachment
[2:10:30.080 --> 2:10:31.080]  is what's the laughable.
[2:10:31.080 --> 2:10:36.080]  Can you imagine the power of him in the well of the Senate, though, doing a 20 minute closing
[2:10:36.080 --> 2:10:37.080]  statement on a teleprompter?
[2:10:37.080 --> 2:10:38.080]  It would devastate them.
[2:10:38.080 --> 2:10:39.080]  Wow.
[2:10:39.080 --> 2:10:41.080]  This is so incredible.
[2:10:41.080 --> 2:10:45.080]  This could just like they defeated us at the Capitol staging it and taking it away from
[2:10:45.080 --> 2:10:46.080]  us.
[2:10:46.080 --> 2:10:47.080]  We can defeat them here right now.
[2:10:47.080 --> 2:10:49.080]  Victory from the jaws of defeat right now.
[2:10:49.080 --> 2:10:53.080]  I love the Patriot Blend Wake Up America coffee.
[2:10:53.080 --> 2:10:54.080]  I just love it.
[2:10:54.080 --> 2:10:56.080]  I can't get enough of it.
[2:10:56.080 --> 2:10:59.080]  We've got a fresh brew right now.
[2:10:59.080 --> 2:11:00.080]  That's what fills my mug.
[2:11:00.080 --> 2:11:01.080]  That's what fills my belly.
[2:11:01.080 --> 2:11:02.080]  That's what fills my soul.
[2:11:02.080 --> 2:11:04.080]  Wake Up America Patriot Blend coffee.
[2:11:04.080 --> 2:11:09.080]  Folks, we have had this coffee for years at infowarstore.com.
[2:11:09.080 --> 2:11:11.080]  Years never raised the price.
[2:11:11.080 --> 2:11:12.080]  Never.
[2:11:12.080 --> 2:11:14.080]  The Wake Up America Blend, the best coffee.
[2:11:14.080 --> 2:11:15.080]  The crew here loves it.
[2:11:15.080 --> 2:11:16.080]  We drink it every day.
[2:11:16.080 --> 2:11:21.080]  And of course, that's just one of the great ways you can support info wars here.
[2:11:21.080 --> 2:11:23.080]  Everybody drinks coffee or just about everybody.
[2:11:23.080 --> 2:11:28.080]  Why not support info wars and keep the coffee supply at your house with the Wake Up America
[2:11:28.080 --> 2:11:29.080]  Patriot Blend?
[2:11:29.080 --> 2:11:30.080]  Of course, read all the great reviews.
[2:11:30.080 --> 2:11:32.080]  Pretty much a perfect review there.
[2:11:32.080 --> 2:11:33.080]  4.9 star.
[2:11:33.080 --> 2:11:37.080]  When you have thousands of reviews, it's impossible to have a perfect review unless literally
[2:11:37.080 --> 2:11:38.080]  everybody gets a five star.
[2:11:38.080 --> 2:11:42.080]  So I mean, if you have 4.9, that's pretty much everybody gives it a five star except maybe
[2:11:42.080 --> 2:11:43.080]  one or two people.
[2:11:43.080 --> 2:11:47.080]  Patriot Blend 100% organic coffee only available at infowarsstore.com.
[2:11:47.080 --> 2:11:53.080]  We have the technocrats are controlling the food supply.

[2:12:02.080 --> 2:12:04.080]  The subsection is prepared with alex.com.
[2:12:04.080 --> 2:12:06.080]  And it's all these globalists do this.
[2:12:06.080 --> 2:12:10.080]  And as they hoard the food and as they prepare, you need to understand that you need 25 year
[2:12:10.080 --> 2:12:12.080]  food supply in the last 25 years.
[2:12:12.080 --> 2:12:16.080]  One month, three months, six months, one year supplies, and it's the highest quality you're
[2:12:16.080 --> 2:12:17.080]  going to find.
[2:12:17.080 --> 2:12:21.080]  And it's just good to have that check box taken care of and you know you're getting good food
[2:12:21.080 --> 2:12:22.080]  at a very good price.
[2:12:22.080 --> 2:12:25.080]  And you know that a small percentage of it because there's not much profit in this goes
[2:12:25.080 --> 2:12:27.080]  to us to fund our operation.
[2:12:27.080 --> 2:12:30.080]  So prepare with alex.com or infowarsstore.com.
[2:12:30.080 --> 2:12:34.080]  You can find the preparedness section there, water filtration, air filtration.
[2:12:34.080 --> 2:12:35.080]  It's all there.
[2:12:35.080 --> 2:12:38.080]  The technocrats are getting ready to bring in all the forced GMO and more.
[2:12:38.080 --> 2:12:39.080]  It's time to start getting prepared.
[2:12:39.080 --> 2:12:40.080]  It starts with self defense.
[2:12:40.080 --> 2:12:42.080]  It starts with being prepared.
[2:12:42.080 --> 2:12:43.080]  It starts with horrible food.
[2:12:43.080 --> 2:12:45.080]  It starts with digging in with a long globalist fight.
[2:12:45.080 --> 2:13:12.080]  You'll win in the end.
[2:13:12.080 --> 2:13:15.080]  All right folks, Robert Barnes is here with me.
[2:13:15.080 --> 2:13:16.080]  I'm Alex Jones.
[2:13:16.080 --> 2:13:17.080]  We're having amazing discussions during the break.
[2:13:17.080 --> 2:13:20.080]  And I got to say we're some pateco and what the president needs to do.
[2:13:20.080 --> 2:13:22.080]  The media is like, oh, you better not bring up fraud.
[2:13:22.080 --> 2:13:24.080]  Oh, you better not defend yourself.
[2:13:24.080 --> 2:13:26.080]  You better just be right on the legal issues.
[2:13:26.080 --> 2:13:28.080]  That's why their legal team quit.
[2:13:28.080 --> 2:13:30.080]  No, Trump figured out they were wimps and got rid of them.
[2:13:30.080 --> 2:13:31.080]  He's talking to Barnes.
[2:13:31.080 --> 2:13:32.080]  He's got a solid team now.
[2:13:32.080 --> 2:13:37.080]  I think somebody like Jay Sekulow or Robert Barnes would be great to present the videos.
[2:13:37.080 --> 2:13:42.080]  Does it all go back to the negotiations this week on how this trial is held?
[2:13:42.080 --> 2:13:46.080]  Because Shucky Schumer and McConnell are out to get Trump and kill the populist movement.
[2:13:46.080 --> 2:13:48.080]  They know he really wanted a landslide.
[2:13:48.080 --> 2:13:53.080]  So it sounds like that everything is being baked right now into the cake.
[2:13:53.080 --> 2:13:56.080]  And is this week almost more important than next week?
[2:13:56.080 --> 2:14:01.080]  Yes, because the president needed to incorporate all of his tools available to him
[2:14:01.080 --> 2:14:04.080]  to leverage the best advantage in terms of what happens next week
[2:14:04.080 --> 2:14:06.080]  or even if a trial moves forward.
[2:14:06.080 --> 2:14:10.080]  What they wanted initially was discredit him, discredit the movement.
[2:14:10.080 --> 2:14:14.080]  And Trump momentarily had been gaslit the last several weeks,
[2:14:14.080 --> 2:14:18.080]  even he was in the White House by some bad actors who were no longer around him
[2:14:18.080 --> 2:14:22.080]  into believing that he was going to lose, that he was going to get convicted,
[2:14:22.080 --> 2:14:27.080]  that he didn't stand a chance, that he was going to be criminally prosecuted after that.
[2:14:27.080 --> 2:14:29.080]  His family was going to be criminally prosecuted.
[2:14:29.080 --> 2:14:30.080]  All that jazz.
[2:14:30.080 --> 2:14:35.080]  And some of us were saying that that was all bluff, that they never had 17 votes to convict.
[2:14:35.080 --> 2:14:38.080]  They weren't that suicidal politically.
[2:14:38.080 --> 2:14:41.080]  And it suggested to him, and he did take up on this suggestion,
[2:14:41.080 --> 2:14:45.080]  which was threaten a third party because it will motivate them to remember
[2:14:45.080 --> 2:14:49.080]  that it's mutually assured destruction if they even think about convicting you.
[2:14:49.080 --> 2:14:52.080]  And once he did that, the polling of course came out,
[2:14:52.080 --> 2:14:55.080]  showed more people would vote for the third party than the Republican party,
[2:14:55.080 --> 2:14:59.080]  immediately showed Liz Cheney has no shot in 2022.
[2:14:59.080 --> 2:15:02.080]  He's just like he did with the Bush family and the Clinton family.
[2:15:02.080 --> 2:15:05.080]  He's now taken out the Cheney family as a threat to democracy.
[2:15:05.080 --> 2:15:08.080]  They're trying to buffalo Trump into thinking be quieter will get you.
[2:15:08.080 --> 2:15:10.080]  If he's quiet, they're going to get him.
[2:15:10.080 --> 2:15:12.080]  He's got to marshal his people now.
[2:15:12.080 --> 2:15:13.080]  Exactly.
[2:15:13.080 --> 2:15:15.080]  And that's what he figured out last week.
[2:15:15.080 --> 2:15:17.080]  That's why he took the actions he did over the weekend.
[2:15:17.080 --> 2:15:19.080]  He was like, I'm not going to go that path.
[2:15:19.080 --> 2:15:22.080]  So that's why he told Lindsey Graham's people to take a hike,
[2:15:22.080 --> 2:15:24.080]  decided to bring in his own people who had agreed,
[2:15:24.080 --> 2:15:29.080]  who have agreed that they will put any argument forward that he wants to have put forward.
[2:15:29.080 --> 2:15:34.080]  And part of that has to be at least the option of looking at the election issues
[2:15:34.080 --> 2:15:38.080]  because the president was completely denied any evidentiary trial,
[2:15:38.080 --> 2:15:43.080]  any bench trial, any meaningful hearing in a single case he was a part of
[2:15:43.080 --> 2:15:46.080]  on the election constitutional issues that he raised.
[2:15:46.080 --> 2:15:48.080]  He was never given a evidentiary hearing.
[2:15:48.080 --> 2:15:50.080]  He was never given a jury trial.
[2:15:50.080 --> 2:15:53.080]  He was never even given a meaningful hearing on the merits.
[2:15:53.080 --> 2:15:58.080]  And so he should use this as an opportunity to do so.
[2:15:58.080 --> 2:16:02.080]  And the reason why it's relevant and the reason why it's material evidentiary wise
[2:16:02.080 --> 2:16:06.080]  is because they're claiming any statement he made about the election
[2:16:06.080 --> 2:16:09.080]  was in bad faith and illicit incitement.
[2:16:09.080 --> 2:16:12.080]  And he can show not only could it never fit the definition
[2:16:12.080 --> 2:16:15.080]  constitutionally of incitement under the free speech clause,
[2:16:15.080 --> 2:16:17.080]  but it was all in good faith.
[2:16:17.080 --> 2:16:19.080]  He could document and remind the people there.
[2:16:19.080 --> 2:16:22.080]  There's one of the people that are leading the prosecution against him
[2:16:22.080 --> 2:16:26.080]  that voted against his certification in 2017.
[2:16:26.080 --> 2:16:27.080]  Incredible.
[2:16:27.080 --> 2:16:29.080]  Sorry.
[2:16:29.080 --> 2:16:31.080]  It's just incredible.
[2:16:31.080 --> 2:16:33.080]  Exactly. The Democrats said we're going to contest no matter what.
[2:16:33.080 --> 2:16:35.080]  We're going to try to block the electors.
[2:16:35.080 --> 2:16:37.080]  We're going to split the country and have secession.
[2:16:37.080 --> 2:16:39.080]  John Podesta told the New York Times.
[2:16:39.080 --> 2:16:42.080]  And they're going to break in the country up in the Civil War.
[2:16:42.080 --> 2:16:44.080]  All Trump said was be peaceful in protest.
[2:16:44.080 --> 2:16:47.080]  And so this is the ultimate gaslighting, as you said.
[2:16:47.080 --> 2:16:49.080]  This hoax that he did something wrong.
[2:16:49.080 --> 2:16:52.080]  And as you said, they scared him at the end to go.
[2:16:52.080 --> 2:16:54.080]  They scared him with all this by saying you're in deep trouble,
[2:16:54.080 --> 2:16:56.080]  but his instincts kicked back in.
[2:16:56.080 --> 2:16:57.080]  Exactly.
[2:16:57.080 --> 2:17:01.080]  And what he should do is remind, because also half the country doesn't know.
[2:17:01.080 --> 2:17:04.080]  And this is going to be broadcast everywhere, the impeachment trial.
[2:17:04.080 --> 2:17:07.080]  You just said it. That's why he's been censored everywhere.
[2:17:07.080 --> 2:17:09.080]  What are they going to do?
[2:17:09.080 --> 2:17:11.080]  Because first they want the trial, now they're still going to do it.
[2:17:11.080 --> 2:17:15.080]  Why are they still doing it, even though this is a very dangerous move for them
[2:17:15.080 --> 2:17:19.080]  to put the real president who won a landslide under trial for nothing?
[2:17:19.080 --> 2:17:22.080]  It seems like a very risky move by them.
[2:17:22.080 --> 2:17:26.080]  It was because they thought they, initially they thought the country would be on their side,
[2:17:26.080 --> 2:17:28.080]  then they found out otherwise.
[2:17:28.080 --> 2:17:30.080]  Then they thought they don't have to worry about it,
[2:17:30.080 --> 2:17:32.080]  because Lindsey Graham was co-opting his Trump's defense.
[2:17:32.080 --> 2:17:34.080]  And that's why what Trump...
[2:17:34.080 --> 2:17:37.080]  So what are they going to do now that Trump's got good defense?
[2:17:37.080 --> 2:17:40.080]  And now that he's got all of his defense available to him,
[2:17:40.080 --> 2:17:44.080]  it would be very interesting to watch, because Trump could use this stage
[2:17:44.080 --> 2:17:48.080]  as an opportunity to not only vindicate and validate his actions on January 6th,
[2:17:48.080 --> 2:17:53.080]  but that 99.99% of the people who participated in those rallies
[2:17:53.080 --> 2:17:56.080]  were peaceful and did nothing illegal or criminal.
[2:17:56.080 --> 2:17:59.080]  In part thanks to the actions that you and other people took
[2:17:59.080 --> 2:18:02.080]  to make sure it stayed peaceful while there.
[2:18:02.080 --> 2:18:06.080]  And on top of that, remind and show for many people for the first time
[2:18:06.080 --> 2:18:08.080]  what really happened in this election.
[2:18:08.080 --> 2:18:11.080]  What happened in this election was there were people who voted
[2:18:11.080 --> 2:18:13.080]  who were not entitled to vote.
[2:18:13.080 --> 2:18:17.080]  There were people who cast ballots in a manner that they were not entitled to be counted.
[2:18:17.080 --> 2:18:20.080]  There were people who counted votes in a way that broke the laws.
[2:18:20.080 --> 2:18:24.080]  So that this was an unconstitutional election at every key stage of the election.
[2:18:24.080 --> 2:18:26.080]  That's why he was raising the issues.
[2:18:26.080 --> 2:18:28.080]  They've been objecting in the House...
[2:18:28.080 --> 2:18:30.080]  And he could show the Democrats saying,
[2:18:30.080 --> 2:18:32.080]  we're going to object no matter what, even if it's clear he won.
[2:18:32.080 --> 2:18:33.080]  He had evidence.
[2:18:33.080 --> 2:18:35.080]  So the idea that objecting is terrorism,
[2:18:35.080 --> 2:18:37.080]  he could just show all the videos of them saying,
[2:18:37.080 --> 2:18:39.080]  we are going to contest no matter what.
[2:18:39.080 --> 2:18:44.080]  We have every Democrat, major Democrat from AOC to Hillary saying that.
[2:18:44.080 --> 2:18:47.080]  And show the footage of them kicking out observers
[2:18:47.080 --> 2:18:51.080]  and then bringing out the ballots in Atlanta from underneath the tables
[2:18:51.080 --> 2:18:53.080]  and then counting them in secret.
[2:18:53.080 --> 2:18:55.080]  Show the footage like that you're showing just now
[2:18:55.080 --> 2:18:59.080]  of the people who were excluded from being able to watch the counting of the ballots.
[2:18:59.080 --> 2:19:02.080]  Document and detail the stories of the number of ballots that were sent out
[2:19:02.080 --> 2:19:06.080]  that was a record that came back where the signature matches were never done
[2:19:06.080 --> 2:19:09.080]  and in the few places that they were, they came back as not-
[2:19:09.080 --> 2:19:12.080]  What do you make of this new litmus test with Republican senators saying,
[2:19:12.080 --> 2:19:15.080]  we've got to admit Biden won, don't question, it's bad to question.
[2:19:15.080 --> 2:19:17.080]  That's, even if we were wrong, we have a right to question.
[2:19:17.080 --> 2:19:18.080]  But we're right.
[2:19:18.080 --> 2:19:19.080]  I mean, they are really scared.
[2:19:19.080 --> 2:19:21.080]  They know they put an illegitimate,
[2:19:21.080 --> 2:19:25.080]  daughtering, creature, chai con agent in the White House.
[2:19:25.080 --> 2:19:28.080]  I like to call him his fraudulency the second.
[2:19:28.080 --> 2:19:30.080]  After his fraudulency the first,
[2:19:30.080 --> 2:19:33.080]  Rutherford B. Hayes in 1876 who had his election stolen,
[2:19:33.080 --> 2:19:37.080]  and I would incorporate that rhetoric and language on the floor of the Capitol.
[2:19:37.080 --> 2:19:40.080]  Say that this is about his fraudulency the second,
[2:19:40.080 --> 2:19:44.080]  having his gas lit the country about what really happened in the election.
[2:19:44.080 --> 2:19:46.080]  Not only what really happened on January 6,
[2:19:46.080 --> 2:19:48.080]  but what really happened in the election.
[2:19:48.080 --> 2:19:51.080]  What really happened in the election is this was an election that violated
[2:19:51.080 --> 2:19:54.080]  every core provision of an honest, open, transparent election.
[2:19:54.080 --> 2:19:59.080]  That it will happen again unless we take remedial action.
[2:19:59.080 --> 2:20:03.080]  Oh, and now they've got HR1 that codifies the fraud.
[2:20:03.080 --> 2:20:04.080]  Exactly.
[2:20:04.080 --> 2:20:06.080]  And that's when you can say that that's what this is really about,
[2:20:06.080 --> 2:20:10.080]  his fraudulency being gas lit as a legitimate president,
[2:20:10.080 --> 2:20:13.080]  elected in a constitutional manner when he wasn't,
[2:20:13.080 --> 2:20:16.080]  and about greenlighting this for the future.
[2:20:16.080 --> 2:20:19.080]  Not only about trying to gas lit people about Trump in the past
[2:20:19.080 --> 2:20:21.080]  and trying to destroy him and his movement,
[2:20:21.080 --> 2:20:24.080]  and leverage this opportunity to show the world the truth.
[2:20:24.080 --> 2:20:27.080]  And by doing so, leverage election law reform,
[2:20:27.080 --> 2:20:30.080]  leverage more than just protecting and preserving him.
[2:20:30.080 --> 2:20:32.080]  By the way, I know you know the inside scoop.
[2:20:32.080 --> 2:20:35.080]  Very great to know you're still able to talk to Trump.
[2:20:35.080 --> 2:20:36.080]  Amazing.
[2:20:36.080 --> 2:20:38.080]  So just hopefully he goes on the offense.
[2:20:38.080 --> 2:20:39.080]  It looks like it's going to happen.
[2:20:39.080 --> 2:20:41.080]  Then I would expect him to try to maybe withdraw this
[2:20:41.080 --> 2:20:44.080]  or maybe have a vote like they did last impeachment last January.
[2:20:44.080 --> 2:20:46.080]  Isn't there a chance they could just shut this down
[2:20:46.080 --> 2:20:49.080]  because they realize that Trump isn't going to roll over?
[2:20:49.080 --> 2:20:51.080]  There's already talk in Washington of exactly that.
[2:20:51.080 --> 2:20:54.080]  So the president got wind of that this past week
[2:20:54.080 --> 2:20:57.080]  that they would rather just dismiss the whole proceedings,
[2:20:57.080 --> 2:21:02.080]  censor them, and move on than hold a trial that could embarrass and humiliate them.
[2:21:02.080 --> 2:21:05.080]  And that's why he took the leverage of saying,
[2:21:05.080 --> 2:21:08.080]  well, I'm going to try to embarrass and humiliate you because you're on trial.
[2:21:08.080 --> 2:21:10.080]  I'm going to impeach the impeachment.
[2:21:10.080 --> 2:21:12.080]  It's Congress that deserves to be impeached,
[2:21:12.080 --> 2:21:15.080]  and it's Congress that warrants conviction for violation of the Congress.
[2:21:15.080 --> 2:21:17.080]  I'm going to make a prediction.
[2:21:17.080 --> 2:21:19.080]  I think it's a very good chance they're going to state to mass shooting
[2:21:19.080 --> 2:21:22.080]  or bombing days before to change the subject onto his supporters
[2:21:22.080 --> 2:21:23.080]  and claim he's a terrorist.
[2:21:23.080 --> 2:21:25.080]  I think that's what they're saying.
[2:21:25.080 --> 2:21:26.080]  Everybody's a terrorist.
[2:21:26.080 --> 2:21:28.080]  Ted Cruz is going to kill AOC.
[2:21:28.080 --> 2:21:29.080]  That's what I think is going to happen.
[2:21:29.080 --> 2:21:32.080]  Robert Barnes, join us again for a full hour this week if you can
[2:21:32.080 --> 2:21:35.080]  on the Marshall Law, the New World Order, all of it.
[2:21:35.080 --> 2:21:36.080]  Again, Barnes Law.
[2:21:36.080 --> 2:21:37.080]  You can find Robert Barnes anywhere.
[2:21:37.080 --> 2:21:38.080]  Just Google his name.
[2:21:38.080 --> 2:21:40.080]  You'll find him on Twitter.
[2:21:40.080 --> 2:21:42.080]  Amazing. Thank you so much, Barnes.
[2:21:42.080 --> 2:21:44.080]  Absolutely. Always glad to do it. Thanks, Alex.
[2:21:44.080 --> 2:21:59.080]  We'll be back.
[2:22:14.080 --> 2:22:16.080]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[2:22:44.080 --> 2:22:48.080]  By visiting infowarstore.com.
[2:23:15.080 --> 2:23:17.080]  And now they're coming after the president.
[2:23:17.080 --> 2:23:18.080]  They're coming after you.
[2:23:18.080 --> 2:23:19.080]  They're coming after me.
[2:23:19.080 --> 2:23:21.080]  They're shutting everybody off the internet.
[2:23:21.080 --> 2:23:23.080]  They're trying to totally censor us.
[2:23:23.080 --> 2:23:25.080]  And that's why M-Full Wars is still in the fight
[2:23:25.080 --> 2:23:27.080]  because we knew this was coming.
[2:23:27.080 --> 2:23:28.080]  We told you this was coming.
[2:23:28.080 --> 2:23:32.080]  We were the first main target that we're still on air at infowars.com
[2:23:32.080 --> 2:23:34.080]  and newswars.com and Bandog video.
[2:23:34.080 --> 2:23:36.080]  Without your word of mouth and without your prayer,
[2:23:36.080 --> 2:23:38.080]  without your financial support, we can't stay on air.
[2:23:38.080 --> 2:23:41.080]  So while you still can, go to infowarstore.com

[2:23:45.080 --> 2:23:47.080]  At infowarstore.com.
[2:23:47.080 --> 2:23:49.080]  I've got some bad news.
[2:23:49.080 --> 2:23:51.080]  Our best-selling vitamin mineral fusion has sold out
[2:23:51.080 --> 2:23:53.080]  because people understand in these stressful times
[2:23:53.080 --> 2:23:55.080]  it's now more important than ever
[2:23:55.080 --> 2:23:57.080]  to boost your body's natural defenses.
[2:23:57.080 --> 2:23:58.080]  But here's the good news.
[2:23:58.080 --> 2:24:01.080]  Turmeric acts in very similar ways
[2:24:01.080 --> 2:24:03.080]  and is so good for inflammation,
[2:24:03.080 --> 2:24:05.080]  so good for your immune system.
[2:24:05.080 --> 2:24:07.080]  And we've got two great turmeric formulas.
[2:24:07.080 --> 2:24:09.080]  One is body's ultimate turmeric formula
[2:24:09.080 --> 2:24:11.080]  that is a dried turmeric extract,
[2:24:11.080 --> 2:24:13.080]  95% humanoid.
[2:24:13.080 --> 2:24:14.080]  People love it.
[2:24:14.080 --> 2:24:15.080]  That's selling out.
[2:24:15.080 --> 2:24:18.080]  Despite that, it's still discounted at infowars.com.
[2:24:18.080 --> 2:24:20.080]  And then also selling out this week
[2:24:20.080 --> 2:24:22.080]  is our liquid turmeric extract.
[2:24:22.080 --> 2:24:24.080]  It's called liquid turmeric extract.
[2:24:24.080 --> 2:24:25.080]  People really love it.
[2:24:25.080 --> 2:24:27.080]  It's extremely strong as well.
[2:24:27.080 --> 2:24:28.080]  It's selling out.
[2:24:28.080 --> 2:24:31.080]  And your purchase doesn't just help yourself and your body.
[2:24:31.080 --> 2:24:33.080]  It also funds the info war and keeps us on air
[2:24:33.080 --> 2:24:35.080]  while they're trying to shut everybody down.
[2:24:35.080 --> 2:24:37.080]  So thank you all for your support.
[2:24:37.080 --> 2:24:40.080]  Please visit infowarstore.com
[2:24:40.080 --> 2:24:42.080]  and find so many other great items
[2:24:42.080 --> 2:24:44.080]  that will enrich yourself and your family's life
[2:24:44.080 --> 2:24:45.080]  and fund the info war.
[2:24:45.080 --> 2:25:08.080]  God bless and good luck.
[2:25:15.080 --> 2:25:22.080]  All right.
[2:25:22.080 --> 2:25:25.080]  You're about to see some of the most incredible gas
[2:25:25.080 --> 2:25:27.080]  lighting ever.
[2:25:27.080 --> 2:25:30.080]  Brian Stelter has like 100,000 viewers.
[2:25:30.080 --> 2:25:32.080]  He's promoted all over CNN.
[2:25:32.080 --> 2:25:36.080]  He is a total abject failure and a liar.
[2:25:36.080 --> 2:25:43.080]  And Brian Stelter continues to hammer
[2:25:43.080 --> 2:25:47.080]  for the censorship, the deplatforming of millions of Americans
[2:25:47.080 --> 2:25:50.080]  that support America, that support President Trump,
[2:25:50.080 --> 2:25:54.080]  that support borders, that support freedom of speech.
[2:25:54.080 --> 2:25:58.080]  And the way he gas lights people is so amateur,
[2:25:58.080 --> 2:26:03.080]  he sits there and says,
[2:26:03.080 --> 2:26:07.080]  we need to help Fox News by taking it off the air.
[2:26:07.080 --> 2:26:09.080]  We're not trying to take them down because they're competition.
[2:26:09.080 --> 2:26:11.080]  We're not racketeers.
[2:26:11.080 --> 2:26:13.080]  We're not organized criminals.
[2:26:13.080 --> 2:26:18.080]  No, we are trying to help Fox News.
[2:26:18.080 --> 2:26:24.080]  And censorship is just totally removing somebody.
[2:26:24.080 --> 2:26:27.080]  It's not cutting back their reach.
[2:26:27.080 --> 2:26:28.080]  Really.
[2:26:28.080 --> 2:26:31.080]  So they've taken parlor off the air, CNN wants it gone,
[2:26:31.080 --> 2:26:33.080]  just because somebody might be on there, they don't control
[2:26:33.080 --> 2:26:35.080]  because it's competition to big tech.
[2:26:35.080 --> 2:26:37.080]  And now they want telegram shut down
[2:26:37.080 --> 2:26:39.080]  and they want people's emails taken away
[2:26:39.080 --> 2:26:42.080]  and Facebook with WhatsApp for two years
[2:26:42.080 --> 2:26:45.080]  is blocking what people can text message.
[2:26:45.080 --> 2:26:48.080]  I mean, my God, they've got Spotify admitting
[2:26:48.080 --> 2:26:51.080]  they're listening to you over the microphone 24-7
[2:26:51.080 --> 2:26:56.080]  deciding what your psychological algorithm is.
[2:26:56.080 --> 2:26:57.080]  So is Google.
[2:26:57.080 --> 2:27:00.080]  So these people are just monsters.
[2:27:00.080 --> 2:27:03.080]  They're absolute total monsters.
[2:27:03.080 --> 2:27:07.080]  And they tell you that we just need to take Fox off cable
[2:27:07.080 --> 2:27:10.080]  and satellite networks.
[2:27:10.080 --> 2:27:11.080]  That's not censorship.
[2:27:11.080 --> 2:27:15.080]  No, taking someone off the satellite and TV is not censorship.
[2:27:15.080 --> 2:27:17.080]  It's like walking with someone with a hatchet and saying,
[2:27:17.080 --> 2:27:19.080]  me hitting you in the face with this
[2:27:19.080 --> 2:27:23.080]  is not hitting you in the face with a hatchet.
[2:27:23.080 --> 2:27:25.080]  But Stelter, even if they pay to be on in the airports,
[2:27:25.080 --> 2:27:27.080]  they pay to be in the bars, they pay to be in the hotels,
[2:27:27.080 --> 2:27:29.080]  no one watches it.
[2:27:29.080 --> 2:27:32.080]  They're a joke.
[2:27:32.080 --> 2:27:34.080]  But they convince, I guess, the governing class
[2:27:34.080 --> 2:27:37.080]  that they're still in charge pulling this type of crap.
[2:27:37.080 --> 2:27:39.080]  I mean, look at that disingenuous person.
[2:27:39.080 --> 2:27:41.080]  No one would be around.
[2:27:41.080 --> 2:27:43.080]  It's such a disconnected psychotic.
[2:27:43.080 --> 2:27:45.080]  Look at him.
[2:27:45.080 --> 2:27:49.080]  Totally fake.
[2:27:49.080 --> 2:27:50.080]  And again, I'll say it.
[2:27:50.080 --> 2:27:52.080]  I'm not saying Brown Stelter is a child molester.
[2:27:52.080 --> 2:27:54.080]  I'm saying if I was a Hollywood director
[2:27:54.080 --> 2:27:56.080]  making a movie about it the clown,
[2:27:56.080 --> 2:27:58.080]  a creature that grabs children and drags them in the sewer
[2:27:58.080 --> 2:28:00.080]  and eats them,
[2:28:00.080 --> 2:28:02.080]  no makeup is needed.
[2:28:02.080 --> 2:28:05.080]  I mean, he just reeks of disingenuous evil.
[2:28:05.080 --> 2:28:10.080]  He just stinks to high heaven of hell itself.
[2:28:10.080 --> 2:28:12.080]  And it's Oliver Darcy.
[2:28:12.080 --> 2:28:16.080]  He's his own little minion that runs around behind him.
[2:28:16.080 --> 2:28:20.080]  And it's just a nightmare vision of this is what Satan creates.
[2:28:20.080 --> 2:28:23.080]  This is who he gives power.
[2:28:23.080 --> 2:28:25.080]  And I'm not the only one that notices
[2:28:25.080 --> 2:28:26.080]  he looks like the clown.
[2:28:26.080 --> 2:28:28.080]  I mean, it's quite the meme.
[2:28:28.080 --> 2:28:30.080]  So what does the clown do?
[2:28:30.080 --> 2:28:31.080]  Well, he doesn't eat little kids in the sewers.
[2:28:31.080 --> 2:28:34.080]  He eats the First Amendment and then tells you
[2:28:34.080 --> 2:28:37.080]  that he's helping Tucker Carlson getting him off the air.
[2:28:37.080 --> 2:28:39.080]  I'm helping you.
[2:28:39.080 --> 2:28:43.080]  I'm helping you grow the arrogance, the attitude that he's in charge
[2:28:43.080 --> 2:28:45.080]  and he's the boss and he's the master.
[2:28:45.080 --> 2:28:47.080]  Here it is.
[2:28:47.080 --> 2:28:51.080]  And the polluters are trying to deflect blame.
[2:28:51.080 --> 2:28:55.080]  Dishonest cries of censorship are filling Fox's airwaves,
[2:28:55.080 --> 2:28:59.080]  which charges that these guys right here are being suppressed.
[2:28:59.080 --> 2:29:03.080]  The word censorship has been invoked almost 400 times
[2:29:03.080 --> 2:29:07.080]  on Fox this month alone and more than 300 times on Newsmax.
[2:29:07.080 --> 2:29:10.080]  You know, post insurrection, a book publisher decided
[2:29:10.080 --> 2:29:13.080]  that it does not want to be in business with Senator Josh Hawley.
[2:29:13.080 --> 2:29:17.080]  So he's been on a national TV tour claiming he's muzzled.
[2:29:17.080 --> 2:29:21.080]  And Tucker Carlson is telling viewers that this network, CNN,
[2:29:21.080 --> 2:29:24.080]  is trying to force Fox News off you.
[2:29:24.080 --> 2:29:25.080]  Well, let's pause. Back this up.
[2:29:25.080 --> 2:29:28.080]  They're openly in all these shows the last six months saying
[2:29:28.080 --> 2:29:31.080]  take him off the air, take his sponsors, take him off his cable system,
[2:29:31.080 --> 2:29:34.080]  take him off his TV system, take him off the satellite system.
[2:29:34.080 --> 2:29:36.080]  Just like when they were banning me, they would go,
[2:29:36.080 --> 2:29:39.080]  Jones claims he's being censored.
[2:29:39.080 --> 2:29:41.080]  He's just been taking off 60 platforms.
[2:29:41.080 --> 2:29:45.080]  It's like saying, Jones claims he's wearing a black long-sleeved shirt.
[2:29:45.080 --> 2:29:46.080]  Jones is a liar.
[2:29:46.080 --> 2:29:48.080]  Well, I am wearing a black shirt.
[2:29:48.080 --> 2:29:52.080]  I mean, again, this is gaslighting and it's something psychos do
[2:29:52.080 --> 2:29:57.080]  where they just love to lie to you.
[2:29:57.080 --> 2:30:02.080]  They love, I mean, it's just incredible.
[2:30:02.080 --> 2:30:05.080]  Biden's broken basically every promise he said he would accept
[2:30:05.080 --> 2:30:08.080]  to shut down our energy supply.
[2:30:08.080 --> 2:30:10.080]  So again, I don't mean to interrupt this.
[2:30:10.080 --> 2:30:14.080]  Just listening to this is not just a lie.
[2:30:14.080 --> 2:30:16.080]  It's like saying that fire engine is not red.
[2:30:16.080 --> 2:30:18.080]  It's green.
[2:30:18.080 --> 2:30:20.080]  You're like, no, it's fire engine red.
[2:30:20.080 --> 2:30:22.080]  He's like, no, it is not.
[2:30:22.080 --> 2:30:25.080]  And then he goes on to say, we're helping him take him off the air.
[2:30:25.080 --> 2:30:26.080]  That's not censorship.
[2:30:26.080 --> 2:30:29.080]  So censorship is not censorship.
[2:30:29.080 --> 2:30:30.080]  Here it is.
[2:30:30.080 --> 2:30:33.080]  I do not want to be in business with Senator Josh Hawley.
[2:30:33.080 --> 2:30:37.080]  So he's been on a national TV tour claiming he's muzzled.
[2:30:37.080 --> 2:30:41.080]  And Tucker Carlson is telling viewers that this network, CNN,
[2:30:41.080 --> 2:30:47.080]  is trying to force Fox News off the air, which is patently false.
[2:30:47.080 --> 2:30:50.080]  It's as predictable as the sunrise.
[2:30:50.080 --> 2:30:54.080]  Democrats win elections and then Republicans say they are being silenced.
[2:30:54.080 --> 2:30:56.080]  But while some cry cancel culture,
[2:30:56.080 --> 2:30:58.080]  let me suggest a different way to think about this.
[2:30:58.080 --> 2:31:03.080]  A harm reduction model.
[2:31:03.080 --> 2:31:07.080]  Most people want clean air and blue skies and accurate news
[2:31:07.080 --> 2:31:08.080]  and rational views.
[2:31:08.080 --> 2:31:11.080]  And then in that healthy environment that looks beautiful,
[2:31:11.080 --> 2:31:14.080]  then we can have great fights about taxes and regulation
[2:31:14.080 --> 2:31:16.080]  and health care and all the rest.
[2:31:16.080 --> 2:31:19.080]  The vast majority of people can agree that disinformation
[2:31:19.080 --> 2:31:22.080]  about, let's say, the pandemic is unhealthy.
[2:31:22.080 --> 2:31:23.080]  It's harmful.
[2:31:23.080 --> 2:31:25.080]  So how can that harm be reduced?
[2:31:25.080 --> 2:31:29.080]  Well, big tech platforms say they are removing lies about vaccines
[2:31:29.080 --> 2:31:33.080]  and stamping out, stop the steel BS and queuing on cult content.
[2:31:33.080 --> 2:31:36.080]  Now, do these private companies have too much power?
[2:31:36.080 --> 2:31:37.080]  Sure.
[2:31:37.080 --> 2:31:38.080]  Many people would say yes, of course they do.
[2:31:38.080 --> 2:31:43.080]  But reducing a liar's reach is not the same as censoring freedom of speech.
[2:31:43.080 --> 2:31:46.080]  Freedom of speech is different than freedom of reach.
[2:31:46.080 --> 2:31:50.080]  And algorithmic reach is part of the problem.
[2:31:50.080 --> 2:31:53.080]  Now, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg seems to agree,
[2:31:53.080 --> 2:31:54.080]  here's the headline from Politico,
[2:31:54.080 --> 2:31:57.080]  he's pledging to depoliticize Facebook.
[2:31:57.080 --> 2:31:59.080]  Zuckerberg says one of the top pieces of feedback
[2:31:59.080 --> 2:32:01.080]  that we're hearing from our community
[2:32:01.080 --> 2:32:03.080]  is that people don't want politics and fighting
[2:32:03.080 --> 2:32:06.080]  to take over their experience on our services.
[2:32:06.080 --> 2:32:09.080]  Well, he's several years too late,
[2:32:09.080 --> 2:32:11.080]  but that is a real issue.
[2:32:11.080 --> 2:32:14.080]  And he wants to now try to clean up Facebook.
[2:32:14.080 --> 2:32:16.080]  But this is bigger than Facebook.
[2:32:16.080 --> 2:32:18.080]  This harm happens all over the place.
[2:32:18.080 --> 2:32:20.080]  In the words of a recently fired Fox News editor,
[2:32:20.080 --> 2:32:23.080]  news consumers are both overfed and malnourished.
[2:32:23.080 --> 2:32:27.080]  So, Stelter's the referee, he's the king, he's the AI,
[2:32:27.080 --> 2:32:30.080]  he decides how to stop the harm.
[2:32:30.080 --> 2:32:32.080]  Because there was no fraud.
[2:32:32.080 --> 2:32:34.080]  And there is no problem with the vaccine.
[2:32:34.080 --> 2:32:38.080]  And, you know, don't point out that they said 2.5 million Americans
[2:32:38.080 --> 2:32:40.080]  would die in the first two months of COVID and that didn't happen.
[2:32:40.080 --> 2:32:43.080]  Don't point out that they admit that they sent people to die in nursing homes.
[2:32:43.080 --> 2:32:46.080]  Don't point any of it out, it's dangerous.
[2:32:46.080 --> 2:32:49.080]  And hey, shut down GameStop too, you know, he said that.
[2:32:49.080 --> 2:32:51.080]  You know, don't let people, as with Warren said,
[2:32:51.080 --> 2:32:54.080]  arrest the GameStop people.
[2:32:54.080 --> 2:32:56.080]  Because, you know, they're causing harm.
[2:32:56.080 --> 2:32:58.080]  We, the establishment, say, we're here protecting you,
[2:32:58.080 --> 2:33:01.080]  we're going to stop, we're going to stop all the harm.
[2:33:01.080 --> 2:33:05.080]  And so everything that is at their agenda is censored and controlled.
[2:33:05.080 --> 2:33:07.080]  And he tells you, we're not censoring,
[2:33:07.080 --> 2:33:10.080]  we're just stopping the reach of harm.
[2:33:10.080 --> 2:33:13.080]  And we're doing you a favor, he says at the full interview,
[2:33:13.080 --> 2:33:17.080]  and trying to help Tucker Carlson, trying to help Alex Jones.
[2:33:17.080 --> 2:33:20.080]  Because we didn't de-platform Alex Jones, he wasn't censored.
[2:33:20.080 --> 2:33:22.080]  I'm not lying to you, I'm Brian Stelter.
[2:33:22.080 --> 2:33:26.080]  Do I act disingenuous? Do I look like a serial killer?
[2:33:26.080 --> 2:33:30.080]  Yes. But you just need to listen to me and not listen to your gut
[2:33:30.080 --> 2:33:34.080]  or the integrity of your own intellectual understanding that I'm a giant liar.
[2:33:34.080 --> 2:33:38.080]  You just need to let me run the show.
[2:33:38.080 --> 2:33:40.080]  Is that clear?
[2:33:40.080 --> 2:33:44.080]  He's had Turner that created CNN once global extermination on record.
[2:33:44.080 --> 2:33:47.080]  Look him up, 900.
[2:33:47.080 --> 2:33:49.080]  He wants 90% of the world killed.
[2:33:49.080 --> 2:33:52.080]  So that's down to 400 million.
[2:33:52.080 --> 2:33:55.080]  I mean, look it up. You can go watch video clips of him saying it.
[2:33:55.080 --> 2:33:57.080]  But see, Stelter doesn't like this.
[2:33:57.080 --> 2:34:00.080]  He doesn't like this show has three, four million viewers a day,
[2:34:00.080 --> 2:34:02.080]  conservatively, even with him trying to suppress us.
[2:34:02.080 --> 2:34:04.080]  And he has 100,000.
[2:34:04.080 --> 2:34:06.080]  But you see, he speaks to the establishment.
[2:34:06.080 --> 2:34:08.080]  Why do we pay attention to him or AOC?
[2:34:08.080 --> 2:34:12.080]  Because they are the mouth or the anus, you could say,
[2:34:12.080 --> 2:34:14.080]  of the establishment that craps on us.
[2:34:14.080 --> 2:34:17.080]  And so we need to know what it's doing and what it's up to.
[2:34:17.080 --> 2:34:21.080]  So he has no viewers, but he is what's about to happen.
[2:34:21.080 --> 2:34:23.080]  Because when he speaks or Oliver Darcy speaks,
[2:34:23.080 --> 2:34:25.080]  it happens because it already was decided.
[2:34:25.080 --> 2:34:30.080]  They're just the spokesman, the town crier telling you the way it is.
[2:34:30.080 --> 2:34:31.080]  Now we come back.
[2:34:31.080 --> 2:34:34.080]  I want to delve into the mental illness of the left
[2:34:34.080 --> 2:34:38.080]  and the mentalization of them with some incredible information
[2:34:38.080 --> 2:34:40.080]  straight ahead that we're going to break down for you.
[2:34:40.080 --> 2:34:43.080]  Just these people are completely delusional.
[2:34:46.080 --> 2:34:48.080]  The best product, I'm not supposed to be biased,
[2:34:48.080 --> 2:34:49.080]  but I'm going to tell you all now,
[2:34:49.080 --> 2:34:51.080]  if you haven't tried TurboForce, you need to try it.
[2:34:51.080 --> 2:34:54.080]  I've tried TurboForce with everything.
[2:34:54.080 --> 2:34:56.080]  Sometimes, you know, I went a little bit crazy.
[2:34:56.080 --> 2:34:58.080]  I put TurboForce in my coffee.
[2:34:58.080 --> 2:34:59.080]  That was a crazy week.
[2:34:59.080 --> 2:35:01.080]  I don't remember sleeping, but as far as the products go,
[2:35:01.080 --> 2:35:04.080]  TurboForce is my favorite and all the Infowars products are down to
[2:35:04.080 --> 2:35:07.080]  taking control of your life, taking control of your health,
[2:35:07.080 --> 2:35:10.080]  not relying on other people to do it for you.
[2:35:10.080 --> 2:35:13.080]  Nobody wakes up in the morning and thinks,
[2:35:13.080 --> 2:35:15.080]  I'm going to give that person over there a better life.
[2:35:15.080 --> 2:35:16.080]  I'm going to wake up today.
[2:35:16.080 --> 2:35:18.080]  You know, I'm going to spend my entire day
[2:35:18.080 --> 2:35:21.080]  trying to make that guy over there healthier, happier, and richer.
[2:35:21.080 --> 2:35:23.080]  I'm going to make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend.
[2:35:23.080 --> 2:35:24.080]  I don't think that happens very often.
[2:35:24.080 --> 2:35:25.080]  It's never happened to me.
[2:35:25.080 --> 2:35:27.080]  I've never had anyone knock on my door and said,
[2:35:27.080 --> 2:35:28.080]  Tate, you're such a good guy.
[2:35:28.080 --> 2:35:30.080]  How can I improve your life in every single way?
[2:35:30.080 --> 2:35:32.080]  There's only one person who woke up and thought,
[2:35:32.080 --> 2:35:33.080]  and that was me.
[2:35:33.080 --> 2:35:34.080]  I woke up and thought, you know what?
[2:35:34.080 --> 2:35:36.080]  Okay, I want to take control of my life.
[2:35:36.080 --> 2:35:37.080]  I want to take control of my health.
[2:35:37.080 --> 2:35:39.080]  And that's why you need to go to Infowars.com,
[2:35:39.080 --> 2:35:41.080]  take control of your health right now and support the resistance.
[2:35:41.080 --> 2:35:42.080]  Don't buy into the group thing.
[2:35:42.080 --> 2:35:43.080]  Don't drink the Kool-Aid.
[2:35:43.080 --> 2:35:44.080]  Drink the TurboForce.
[2:35:44.080 --> 2:35:46.080]  Kool-Aid's bad and the TurboForce is good.
[2:35:46.080 --> 2:35:50.080]  Mr. Dictionary has a very simple definition of terrorism.
[2:35:50.080 --> 2:35:52.080]  Other dictionaries have similar ones.
[2:35:52.080 --> 2:35:56.080]  Terrorism is the threat of force or action carrying out force
[2:35:56.080 --> 2:36:00.080]  for a political or financial reason.
[2:36:00.080 --> 2:36:02.080]  It's basically scaring the hell out of people
[2:36:02.080 --> 2:36:04.080]  until you submit to them.
[2:36:04.080 --> 2:36:07.080]  That's exactly what all this overblown COVID-19 garbage is.
[2:36:07.080 --> 2:36:10.080]  You see the headlines from CNN and you see news.
[2:36:10.080 --> 2:36:12.080]  Doctors say it's worse than they ever thought.
[2:36:12.080 --> 2:36:15.080]  COVID more devastating than they could ever imagine.
[2:36:15.080 --> 2:36:18.080]  They told us that two and a half million people would be dead
[2:36:18.080 --> 2:36:21.080]  just eight months ago, within three months.
[2:36:21.080 --> 2:36:22.080]  Okay?
[2:36:22.080 --> 2:36:25.080]  It's a quarter million if you count all of the people
[2:36:25.080 --> 2:36:27.080]  that died of other things.
[2:36:27.080 --> 2:36:29.080]  We're talking 96% had comorbidity.
[2:36:29.080 --> 2:36:30.080]  These are real numbers.
[2:36:30.080 --> 2:36:31.080]  These are real facts.
[2:36:31.080 --> 2:36:34.080]  This is the chicken little event where we all run our houses,
[2:36:34.080 --> 2:36:36.080]  never come out and are taught we're not essential.
[2:36:36.080 --> 2:36:39.080]  All the big box stores in Amazon take over the planet.
[2:36:39.080 --> 2:36:41.080]  You could stand up against it.
[2:36:41.080 --> 2:36:42.080]  This is slavery.
[2:36:42.080 --> 2:37:11.080]  It is not something you can put up with and survive.
[2:37:11.080 --> 2:37:17.080]  That's why every month we launch a new URL before they ban it.
[2:37:17.080 --> 2:37:21.080]  But Soros and Bill Gates and the globalists are on our tail.
[2:37:21.080 --> 2:37:26.080]  But the new website is the resistance.video.
[2:37:26.080 --> 2:37:28.080]  The resistance.video.
[2:37:28.080 --> 2:37:31.080]  They're trying to block us because the truth is powerful
[2:37:31.080 --> 2:37:32.080]  and can defeat them.
[2:37:32.080 --> 2:37:35.080]  So the new URL that links right to banned.video
[2:37:35.080 --> 2:37:38.080]  and all of our videos and all of our documentaries
[2:37:38.080 --> 2:37:41.080]  and special reports and all the suppressed information
[2:37:41.080 --> 2:37:43.080]  is at the resistance.video.
[2:37:43.080 --> 2:37:44.080]  Share the link.
[2:37:44.080 --> 2:37:46.080]  The resistance.video.
[2:37:46.080 --> 2:37:48.080]  The resistance.video.
[2:37:48.080 --> 2:37:49.080]  I've got some bad news.
[2:37:49.080 --> 2:37:52.080]  Our best-selling vitamin mineral fusion has sold out
[2:37:52.080 --> 2:37:54.080]  because people understand in these stressful times
[2:37:54.080 --> 2:37:56.080]  it's now more important than ever
[2:37:56.080 --> 2:37:58.080]  to boost your body's natural defenses.
[2:37:58.080 --> 2:37:59.080]  Here's the good news.
[2:37:59.080 --> 2:38:02.080]  Turmeric acts in very similar ways
[2:38:02.080 --> 2:38:04.080]  and is so good for inflammation,
[2:38:04.080 --> 2:38:06.080]  so good for your immune system.
[2:38:06.080 --> 2:38:08.080]  There are two great turmeric formulas.
[2:38:08.080 --> 2:38:10.080]  One is body's ultimate turmeric formula
[2:38:10.080 --> 2:38:12.080]  that is a dried turmeric extract,
[2:38:12.080 --> 2:38:14.080]  95% humanoid.
[2:38:14.080 --> 2:38:15.080]  People love it.
[2:38:15.080 --> 2:38:16.080]  That's selling out.
[2:38:16.080 --> 2:38:18.080]  Despite that, it's still discounted
[2:38:18.080 --> 2:38:19.080]  in the inforwarstore.com.
[2:38:19.080 --> 2:38:21.080]  And then also selling out this week
[2:38:21.080 --> 2:38:23.080]  is our liquid turmeric extract.
[2:38:23.080 --> 2:38:25.080]  It's called liquid turmeric extract.
[2:38:25.080 --> 2:38:26.080]  People really love it.
[2:38:26.080 --> 2:38:28.080]  It's extremely strong as well.
[2:38:28.080 --> 2:38:29.080]  It's selling out.
[2:38:29.080 --> 2:38:31.080]  And your purchase doesn't just help yourself
[2:38:31.080 --> 2:38:32.080]  and your body.
[2:38:32.080 --> 2:38:34.080]  It also funds the inforwar
[2:38:34.080 --> 2:38:36.080]  on air while they're trying to shut everybody down.
[2:38:36.080 --> 2:38:38.080]  So thank you all for your support.
[2:38:38.080 --> 2:38:40.080]  Please visit inforwarstore.com
[2:38:40.080 --> 2:38:42.080]  and find so many other great items
[2:38:42.080 --> 2:38:44.080]  that will enrich yourself and your family's life
[2:38:44.080 --> 2:38:45.080]  and fund the inforwar.
[2:38:45.080 --> 2:39:05.080]  God bless and good luck.
[2:39:16.080 --> 2:39:19.080]  Man, the articles on inforwar.com
[2:39:19.080 --> 2:39:23.080]  are in fuego.
[2:39:23.080 --> 2:39:25.080]  Biden Press Secretary gloats over
[2:39:25.080 --> 2:39:26.080]  Trump ban.
[2:39:26.080 --> 2:39:29.080]  Can't say we miss him on Twitter.
[2:39:29.080 --> 2:39:31.080]  Doctor admits masks don't work.
[2:39:31.080 --> 2:39:32.080]  All viruses can get through.
[2:39:32.080 --> 2:39:34.080]  It's just total hoax.
[2:39:34.080 --> 2:39:37.080]  It's like saying a fighter jet
[2:39:37.080 --> 2:39:39.080]  can fly through the Grand Canyon.
[2:39:39.080 --> 2:39:40.080]  You can put 20 fighter jets,
[2:39:40.080 --> 2:39:42.080]  100 fighter jets in some areas,
[2:39:42.080 --> 2:39:43.080]  1,000 fighter jets.
[2:39:43.080 --> 2:39:45.080]  Some areas of Grand Canyon are four miles wide.
[2:39:45.080 --> 2:39:47.080]  It's like...
[2:39:47.080 --> 2:39:49.080]  I was reading the equivalent of a coronavirus
[2:39:49.080 --> 2:39:50.080]  because they're so small.
[2:39:50.080 --> 2:39:52.080]  It's like a BB shooting through
[2:39:52.080 --> 2:39:55.080]  500-foot wide deal.
[2:39:55.080 --> 2:39:57.080]  I mean, seriously.
[2:39:57.080 --> 2:39:59.080]  It's like a BB gun from a Daisy red rider
[2:39:59.080 --> 2:40:01.080]  shooting through a 500-foot window.
[2:40:01.080 --> 2:40:03.080]  It's just ridiculous.
[2:40:03.080 --> 2:40:05.080]  It's absolutely...
[2:40:05.080 --> 2:40:07.080]  Lead is solid, folks, atomically,
[2:40:07.080 --> 2:40:10.080]  but still like Swiss cheese intergalactically
[2:40:10.080 --> 2:40:13.080]  at the subatomic level.
[2:40:13.080 --> 2:40:16.080]  But we, compared to lead, are not very solid.
[2:40:16.080 --> 2:40:17.080]  You understand?
[2:40:17.080 --> 2:40:19.080]  Well, a damn mask is really not solid.
[2:40:19.080 --> 2:40:21.080]  But see, oh, only the UN can say the science
[2:40:21.080 --> 2:40:23.080]  and shut up, Jones.
[2:40:23.080 --> 2:40:25.080]  Sorry.
[2:40:25.080 --> 2:40:29.080]  UK COVID cops arrest man for handing out free soup.
[2:40:29.080 --> 2:40:32.080]  Islamic scholars as Muslims should flee the West
[2:40:32.080 --> 2:40:36.080]  to flee old GBT teachings.
[2:40:36.080 --> 2:40:39.080]  So much more reporters are on the ground in D.C.
[2:40:39.080 --> 2:40:41.080]  Joe Salante's coming up.
[2:40:41.080 --> 2:40:45.080]  Come on, oh, it's a little bit of the next hour.
[2:40:45.080 --> 2:40:47.080]  Well, we can pull up the Twitter on this guy.
[2:40:47.080 --> 2:40:52.080]  I want to show this to people.
[2:40:52.080 --> 2:40:56.080]  Now, as I cover this important piece of news,
[2:40:56.080 --> 2:40:59.080]  I'm not covering it like Hunter S. Thompson would do
[2:40:59.080 --> 2:41:00.080]  because he's writing himself in the story,
[2:41:00.080 --> 2:41:02.080]  Gonzo Journalism.
[2:41:02.080 --> 2:41:04.080]  And I've really not even talked about this
[2:41:04.080 --> 2:41:08.080]  in the last few weeks because it was so comical at first.
[2:41:08.080 --> 2:41:11.080]  But as I watched the hysteria mount,
[2:41:11.080 --> 2:41:15.080]  and as I watched literally hundreds of tweets
[2:41:15.080 --> 2:41:20.080]  that were getting 10,000, 20,000, 100,000 retweets a piece.
[2:41:20.080 --> 2:41:23.080]  I mean, this was trending a few times last few weeks
[2:41:23.080 --> 2:41:25.080]  in the top 10 of Twitter.
[2:41:25.080 --> 2:41:27.080]  Arrest Alex Jones.
[2:41:27.080 --> 2:41:30.080]  And they would post videos that even said
[2:41:30.080 --> 2:41:35.080]  they were from late November of myself and Ali Alexander
[2:41:35.080 --> 2:41:38.080]  and a bunch of other people like Vernon Jones,
[2:41:38.080 --> 2:41:41.080]  state rep there.
[2:41:41.080 --> 2:41:44.080]  Peacefully going into the Capitol, having demonstrations,
[2:41:44.080 --> 2:41:47.080]  and going and meeting with members of the legislature,
[2:41:47.080 --> 2:41:50.080]  asking for them to have hearings
[2:41:50.080 --> 2:41:52.080]  and postpone the certification.
[2:41:52.080 --> 2:41:55.080]  So since the day of the Capitol riot,
[2:41:55.080 --> 2:41:58.080]  they called the ultimate, you know, Pearl Harbor 9-11,
[2:41:58.080 --> 2:42:01.080]  four citizens getting killed and a cop having a heart attack
[2:42:01.080 --> 2:42:04.080]  a few days later and people going through these velvet ropes.
[2:42:04.080 --> 2:42:06.080]  I began to see New York Times writers,
[2:42:06.080 --> 2:42:09.080]  Washington Post writers, CNN writers,
[2:42:09.080 --> 2:42:13.080]  post the same video that had already gone viral
[2:42:13.080 --> 2:42:17.080]  even with the earlier date of, what was it like?
[2:42:17.080 --> 2:42:23.080]  November 20 something in Georgia.
[2:42:23.080 --> 2:42:26.080]  And so I had even law firms reach out to some
[2:42:26.080 --> 2:42:29.080]  and send a message saying, hey, that's Georgia.
[2:42:29.080 --> 2:42:31.080]  We're not storming the Capitol at DC.
[2:42:31.080 --> 2:42:35.080]  I wasn't inside and you shouldn't be calling for my arrest
[2:42:35.080 --> 2:42:37.080]  and saying I'm a terrorist.
[2:42:37.080 --> 2:42:39.080]  I mean, these are open and shut lawsuits
[2:42:39.080 --> 2:42:42.080]  and their response is you're going to jail, terrorist.
[2:42:42.080 --> 2:42:48.080]  So imagine they're posting videos from late November.
[2:42:48.080 --> 2:42:51.080]  January 6 is when the Capitol thing happened
[2:42:51.080 --> 2:42:54.080]  and Ali Alexander, obvious provocateurs are in there saying
[2:42:54.080 --> 2:42:56.080]  we're going to lay down and not leave.
[2:42:56.080 --> 2:42:59.080]  We're going to have a sit-in and Ali says that's a horrible idea
[2:42:59.080 --> 2:43:01.080]  and calls the guy Hillbilly which was pejorative
[2:43:01.080 --> 2:43:03.080]  he should have done it.
[2:43:03.080 --> 2:43:06.080]  They watched that video with the date on it
[2:43:06.080 --> 2:43:07.080]  with millions of views.
[2:43:07.080 --> 2:43:09.080]  They edit that out, re-upload it,
[2:43:09.080 --> 2:43:13.080]  Democrats do, send it out and when they're contacted
[2:43:13.080 --> 2:43:16.080]  they don't care.
[2:43:16.080 --> 2:43:18.080]  And they go, you're going to jail, you're in a lot of trouble.
[2:43:18.080 --> 2:43:20.080]  So here it is.
[2:43:20.080 --> 2:43:22.080]  This guy's name is Don Winslow.
[2:43:22.080 --> 2:43:24.080]  Talk about a lawsuit for him and his publisher
[2:43:24.080 --> 2:43:25.080]  waiting to happen.
[2:43:25.080 --> 2:43:29.080]  He's a fiction writer and a New York Times guy
[2:43:29.080 --> 2:43:33.080]  and he says, I'm offering $75,000 reward to the first person
[2:43:33.080 --> 2:43:36.080]  who gives the FBI Ali Alexander's current location.
[2:43:36.080 --> 2:43:38.080]  Well, do you deplatform him?
[2:43:38.080 --> 2:43:40.080]  He's not hiding, he comes on the show.
[2:43:40.080 --> 2:43:43.080]  But since they deplatform him, they go, oh look, he's hiding.
[2:43:43.080 --> 2:43:46.080]  If you don't want to turn him in because he's a domestic terrorist
[2:43:46.080 --> 2:43:50.080]  you can always turn him in because he is an incredible vile a-hole.
[2:43:50.080 --> 2:43:53.080]  $75,000 and they go on to say,
[2:43:53.080 --> 2:43:56.080]  here they are in the Capitol planning the attack.
[2:43:56.080 --> 2:43:59.080]  Then they go on to say that we were meeting with Congress members
[2:43:59.080 --> 2:44:01.080]  to run the attack the day before,
[2:44:01.080 --> 2:44:04.080]  but then they say it's January 6th as well.
[2:44:04.080 --> 2:44:07.080]  Here's the deal, this has been going on for several weeks with this video.
[2:44:07.080 --> 2:44:12.080]  It's like a million views here, $700,000 here, $75,000 here, $20,000 there
[2:44:12.080 --> 2:44:14.080]  and they all know it's fake.
[2:44:14.080 --> 2:44:17.080]  People go, hey, here's the local TV station, it's Georgia.
[2:44:17.080 --> 2:44:20.080]  They were not violent, Vernon Jones was with them.
[2:44:20.080 --> 2:44:22.080]  They don't care.
[2:44:22.080 --> 2:44:24.080]  Then they start blocking people that say it.
[2:44:24.080 --> 2:44:28.080]  So this guy, Don Wilson, knows this isn't true.
[2:44:28.080 --> 2:44:34.080]  I'm just picking one because he's got like 20,000 retweets here, 40,000 retweets there.
[2:44:34.080 --> 2:44:37.080]  And I've actually had him walk up to me in the street and say,
[2:44:37.080 --> 2:44:42.080]  you're going to go to prison, I've seen the video of you planning the attack with Ali Alexander.
[2:44:42.080 --> 2:44:43.080]  It's crazy.
[2:44:43.080 --> 2:44:45.080]  So let's continue.
[2:44:45.080 --> 2:44:50.080]  Don Winslow says this is called evidence.
[2:44:50.080 --> 2:44:55.080]  And they go on to say, arrest Ali Alexander, arrest me and get us all.
[2:44:55.080 --> 2:44:58.080]  People linked to the original video that it's in November of last year, it's another city.
[2:44:58.080 --> 2:45:00.080]  They don't care.
[2:45:00.080 --> 2:45:04.080]  Dear FBI, Ali Alexander is a domestic terrorist.
[2:45:04.080 --> 2:45:07.080]  You are pursuing him for involvement in 1621.
[2:45:07.080 --> 2:45:10.080]  You are, he says people are, no they're not.
[2:45:10.080 --> 2:45:16.080]  He is currently raising money to evade you and continue to spread hate.
[2:45:16.080 --> 2:45:17.080]  Who set up the account?
[2:45:17.080 --> 2:45:19.080]  How is that money routed?
[2:45:19.080 --> 2:45:20.080]  When does he get it?
[2:45:20.080 --> 2:45:23.080]  Shut it down.
[2:45:23.080 --> 2:45:26.080]  If you see this man, notify the FBI immediately.
[2:45:26.080 --> 2:45:28.080]  Domestic terrorist Ali Alexander.
[2:45:28.080 --> 2:45:33.080]  And he says, I mean, just open and shut libel defamation.
[2:45:33.080 --> 2:45:35.080]  And it gets worse.
[2:45:35.080 --> 2:45:37.080]  This is when he earlier said 50,000.
[2:45:37.080 --> 2:45:40.080]  The first person provides the FBI with direct information to the,
[2:45:40.080 --> 2:45:43.080]  leads the arrest of domestic terrorist Ali Alexander.
[2:45:43.080 --> 2:45:45.080]  No judge, no jury.
[2:45:45.080 --> 2:45:49.080]  New York Times backed writer saying he is a terrorist, period.
[2:45:49.080 --> 2:45:51.080]  It's enough money to begin a fresh start.
[2:45:51.080 --> 2:45:52.080]  Simple.
[2:45:52.080 --> 2:45:57.080]  If the FBI confirms your information, leads to Ali's arrest, I give you 50,000.
[2:45:57.080 --> 2:46:03.080]  So he's putting out videos of Georgia, even with the date on the video, doesn't care.
[2:46:03.080 --> 2:46:06.080]  Totally deranged, totally crazy, totally foaming at the mouth.
[2:46:06.080 --> 2:46:08.080]  And this is just one guy I picked.
[2:46:08.080 --> 2:46:13.080]  This is literally like, you know, 100,000 tweets here, 50,000 there, 30,000 here, 40,000 there.
[2:46:13.080 --> 2:46:14.080]  Just thousands.
[2:46:14.080 --> 2:46:18.080]  Twitter is just arrest Jones, arrest Alexander.
[2:46:18.080 --> 2:46:22.080]  It goes on and on and on.
[2:46:22.080 --> 2:46:24.080]  My, and then they've got other people.
[2:46:24.080 --> 2:46:27.080]  I've never even heard of the Sandy Phillips, never said her name until now.
[2:46:27.080 --> 2:46:32.080]  She says, my husband and I were harassed like this by Alex Jones after our daughter was slaughtered in Aurora,
[2:46:32.080 --> 2:46:34.080]  Colorado movie theater master.
[2:46:34.080 --> 2:46:37.080]  It was emotionally devastating to do this young people.
[2:46:37.080 --> 2:46:47.080]  So a Congresswoman asked hog about how they let the shooter at the Florida high school shooting go 20 plus times
[2:46:47.080 --> 2:46:51.080]  when he threatened to shoot people and pointed that liberal program and allowed it to happen.
[2:46:51.080 --> 2:46:55.080]  They then turned that around and say the Congresswoman is saying it didn't happen.
[2:46:55.080 --> 2:47:00.080]  And that she's harassing families than a woman I've never heard of says I harass her.
[2:47:00.080 --> 2:47:01.080]  I mean, this is what I'm talking about.
[2:47:01.080 --> 2:47:06.080]  These people just say whatever they want, however they want, whenever they want.
[2:47:06.080 --> 2:47:07.080]  And it goes on and on.
[2:47:07.080 --> 2:47:11.080]  So guys, go to, go to Twitter and type in Alex Jones.
[2:47:11.080 --> 2:47:19.080]  Just do a Twitter search and you will see literally thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of tweets saying,
[2:47:19.080 --> 2:47:21.080]  kill me, arrest me.
[2:47:21.080 --> 2:47:22.080]  Here's the proof.
[2:47:22.080 --> 2:47:30.080]  And like I said, people under the comments go, Hey, here's local CNN or local Fox News in Atlanta saying it's, it's a,
[2:47:30.080 --> 2:47:31.080]  it's a peaceful demonstration.
[2:47:31.080 --> 2:47:32.080]  They went in the Capitol.
[2:47:32.080 --> 2:47:33.080]  Here's the full footage.
[2:47:33.080 --> 2:47:38.080]  They don't even want the footage.
[2:47:38.080 --> 2:47:44.080]  They literally say, here's Jones inside commanding the attack.
[2:47:44.080 --> 2:47:46.080]  And then they go, look how nervous Jones is.
[2:47:46.080 --> 2:47:48.080]  It's some live feed.
[2:47:48.080 --> 2:47:52.080]  Some guys almost getting to fight with Ali wanting to stage some type of demonstration.
[2:47:52.080 --> 2:47:57.080]  Ali doesn't even want them to do a sit in at the Capitol.
[2:47:57.080 --> 2:48:04.080]  This is supposedly the terror mastermind who's getting in arguments with people that are coming up wanting to do stuff months ago.
[2:48:04.080 --> 2:48:06.080]  Before the January 6th event.
[2:48:06.080 --> 2:48:09.080]  Here is the video in the Georgia Capitol.
[2:48:09.080 --> 2:48:11.080]  Alex, Alex, they serve.
[2:48:11.080 --> 2:48:12.080]  I'm sorry.
[2:48:12.080 --> 2:48:13.080]  I'm not trying to.
[2:48:13.080 --> 2:48:15.080]  They serve out of here, right?
[2:48:15.080 --> 2:48:17.080]  We're inside.
[2:48:17.080 --> 2:48:19.080]  Let's not leave.
[2:48:19.080 --> 2:48:22.080]  We're not, we're not, we're not, we're not the left.
[2:48:22.080 --> 2:48:24.080]  We're not going to democratize ideas.
[2:48:24.080 --> 2:48:27.080]  Listen to me, listen to me.
[2:48:27.080 --> 2:48:28.080]  It's peaceful.
[2:48:28.080 --> 2:48:29.080]  It's not a bad idea.
[2:48:29.080 --> 2:48:30.080]  Listen to me.
[2:48:30.080 --> 2:48:31.080]  What?
[2:48:31.080 --> 2:48:32.080]  Peaceful sit in.
[2:48:32.080 --> 2:48:33.080]  That's what we'll call it.
[2:48:33.080 --> 2:48:34.080]  Here we go.
[2:48:34.080 --> 2:48:35.080]  If the Hillbillies make up all the ideas and we're going to lose the country.
[2:48:35.080 --> 2:48:36.080]  So put aside your pride.
[2:48:36.080 --> 2:48:37.080]  Listen to me.
[2:48:37.080 --> 2:48:38.080]  We're going to stop the steal.
[2:48:38.080 --> 2:48:40.080]  But first we're going to stop the certification.
[2:48:40.080 --> 2:48:42.080]  Let's talk about it later.
[2:48:42.080 --> 2:48:43.080]  It's good.
[2:48:43.080 --> 2:48:47.080]  It's okay to have ideas.
[2:48:47.080 --> 2:48:48.080]  Everybody's fine.
[2:48:48.080 --> 2:48:49.080]  Yeah.
[2:48:49.080 --> 2:48:50.080]  This is not the idea, man.
[2:48:50.080 --> 2:48:51.080]  We'll just lose the Republic.
[2:48:51.080 --> 2:48:52.080]  And he is, are fine.
[2:48:52.080 --> 2:48:55.080]  Well, he, well, listen, he could have ideas of private citizens.
[2:48:55.080 --> 2:48:56.080]  Yes.
[2:48:56.080 --> 2:49:00.080]  So we're up at the head of about 300 people that went through metal detectors came in.
[2:49:00.080 --> 2:49:05.080]  You can see the photos of us staging the photo with the state reps and the police shaking
[2:49:05.080 --> 2:49:07.080]  their hands and leaving.
[2:49:07.080 --> 2:49:12.080]  That turns into here's the proof they're planning to stop the certification in the U.S. Capitol
[2:49:12.080 --> 2:49:14.080]  and weeks in, they've all been sent this.
[2:49:14.080 --> 2:49:18.080]  The Wall Street Journal has whole articles admitting the truth and that we tried to stop
[2:49:18.080 --> 2:49:20.080]  the riot and all that.
[2:49:20.080 --> 2:49:25.080]  We don't care because this Don Winslow thinks lying is cute and funny.
[2:49:25.080 --> 2:49:26.080]  And he thinks it's powerful.
[2:49:26.080 --> 2:49:30.080]  What he's going to get is his miserable ass and his publisher suit in the ground.
[2:49:30.080 --> 2:49:32.080]  So get ready, Winslow.
[2:49:32.080 --> 2:49:33.080]  We'll be right back.
[2:49:33.080 --> 2:49:34.080]  Stay with us.
[2:49:34.080 --> 2:49:40.080]  We have the technocrats are controlling the food supply.
[2:49:40.080 --> 2:49:43.080]  Secure your own safe source of food supply sale.
[2:49:43.080 --> 2:49:46.080]  It's the new prices in 2021, but it's the lowest price for high quality food.
[2:49:46.080 --> 2:49:51.080]  You're going to find at infowarstore.com, the subsection is prepared with alex.com.
[2:49:51.080 --> 2:49:52.080]  And it's all these globalists do this.
[2:49:52.080 --> 2:49:57.080]  And as they hoard the food and as they prepare, you need to understand that you need 25-year
[2:49:57.080 --> 2:49:59.080]  food supply in the last 25 years.
[2:49:59.080 --> 2:50:01.080]  One month, three months, six months, one year supplies.
[2:50:01.080 --> 2:50:03.080]  And it's the highest quality you're going to find.
[2:50:03.080 --> 2:50:06.080]  And it's just good to have that check box taken care of.
[2:50:06.080 --> 2:50:08.080]  And you know you're getting good food at a very good price.
[2:50:08.080 --> 2:50:14.080]  And you know that a small percentage of it because there's not much profit in this goes to us to fund our operation.
[2:50:14.080 --> 2:50:17.080]  So prepare with alex.com or infowarstore.com.
[2:50:17.080 --> 2:50:21.080]  You can find the preparedness section there, water filtration, air filtration.
[2:50:21.080 --> 2:50:22.080]  It's all there.
[2:50:22.080 --> 2:50:25.080]  The technocrats are getting ready to bring in all the forced GMO and more.
[2:50:25.080 --> 2:50:26.080]  It's time to start getting prepared.
[2:50:26.080 --> 2:50:27.080]  It starts with self-defense.
[2:50:27.080 --> 2:50:29.080]  It starts with being prepared.
[2:50:29.080 --> 2:50:30.080]  It starts with storeable food.
[2:50:30.080 --> 2:50:32.080]  It starts with digging in with a long, globalist fight.
[2:50:32.080 --> 2:50:58.080]  You'll win in the end.
[2:50:58.080 --> 2:51:05.080]  You'll win in the end.
[2:51:05.080 --> 2:51:14.080]  You'll win in the end.
[2:51:14.080 --> 2:51:40.080]  You'll win in the end.
[2:51:40.080 --> 2:51:47.080]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:51:47.080 --> 2:51:59.080]  Take the highway to the end of the night, end of the night, end of the night.
[2:51:59.080 --> 2:52:09.080]  In Burma, or Myanmar as it's now known, they have another Democrat Soros funded communist party called the Democrats.
[2:52:09.080 --> 2:52:12.080]  And they got caught 80 plus thousand examples of fraud.
[2:52:12.080 --> 2:52:13.080]  They have all the witnesses.
[2:52:13.080 --> 2:52:16.080]  They've had months of this going on since their November election.
[2:52:16.080 --> 2:52:21.080]  And so the military took over.
[2:52:21.080 --> 2:52:23.080]  It was like in Indonesia when they had communists pull the same thing.
[2:52:23.080 --> 2:52:26.080]  And I'm not even saying I lionized the military, but I know the players in Burma.
[2:52:26.080 --> 2:52:27.080]  I know it's gone down.
[2:52:27.080 --> 2:52:32.080]  Hell, the UN stage massacres there in the 90s killed tens of thousands of people.
[2:52:32.080 --> 2:52:34.080]  So they're always having globalists take over.
[2:52:34.080 --> 2:52:36.080]  And they finally got their own sovereignty.
[2:52:36.080 --> 2:52:39.080]  They've only got their own military.
[2:52:39.080 --> 2:52:41.080]  And the military is like, we're not putting up with this.
[2:52:41.080 --> 2:52:52.080]  And so now Joe Biden is in threatening military action to invade Burma with a UN force to put the communists back in.
[2:52:52.080 --> 2:52:57.080]  End of the line, end of the line.
[2:52:57.080 --> 2:53:01.080]  That's up on info wars.com right now.
[2:53:01.080 --> 2:53:05.080]  Meanwhile, Biden press secretary gloats over Trump ban.
[2:53:05.080 --> 2:53:08.080]  Can't say we miss him on Twitter.
[2:53:08.080 --> 2:53:11.080]  I'm going to play that clip next segment and hand the baton to Gerald Salante.
[2:53:11.080 --> 2:53:13.080]  Another video on info wars.com.
[2:53:13.080 --> 2:53:15.080]  Doctor admits masks don't work.
[2:53:15.080 --> 2:53:17.080]  All viruses can get through.
[2:53:17.080 --> 2:53:19.080]  I want to shift gears for a minute.
[2:53:19.080 --> 2:53:25.080]  I have made mistakes on air before and I've grown up a lot and I've learned the power of this show.
[2:53:25.080 --> 2:53:28.080]  So I watch what I say because I never consciously lied.
[2:53:28.080 --> 2:53:34.080]  But you know, I'd cover somebody else's new story and then it would become a big thing and it wasn't accurate and I hurt people.
[2:53:34.080 --> 2:53:36.080]  And I tried to fix that.
[2:53:36.080 --> 2:53:41.080]  But man, when these Democrats, I mean, they just don't care folks.
[2:53:41.080 --> 2:53:47.080]  They've known since January 7th that I didn't storm that capital.
[2:53:47.080 --> 2:53:54.080]  And they know that we were at the Georgia capital trying to stop people then that wanted to do a sit in the Democrats to all the time.
[2:53:54.080 --> 2:53:56.080]  But we're not like code pink.
[2:53:56.080 --> 2:54:04.080]  And they turn that into here's the proof of Ali Alexander and Alex Jones planning the capital attack and getting a tour from the capital people in D.C.
[2:54:04.080 --> 2:54:07.080]  Arrest them and Congressman Gozer.
[2:54:07.080 --> 2:54:09.080]  I mean, it's it's crazy.
[2:54:09.080 --> 2:54:11.080]  It's absolutely nuts.
[2:54:11.080 --> 2:54:13.080]  And they people send them.
[2:54:13.080 --> 2:54:15.080]  Hey, here's the original video from November.
[2:54:15.080 --> 2:54:16.080]  They don't even respond.
[2:54:16.080 --> 2:54:18.080]  They delete it or they block it.
[2:54:18.080 --> 2:54:23.080]  And just to me to lie so big, man.
[2:54:23.080 --> 2:54:26.080]  It just shows they're in a crazed mode.
[2:54:26.080 --> 2:54:30.080]  I mean, because, you know, I mean, if I want to spend a year suing this guy and everything, I want everything.
[2:54:30.080 --> 2:54:32.080]  Yes, he's a wealthy author.
[2:54:32.080 --> 2:54:36.080]  He's got a bunch of big, you know, best selling books, fiction books.
[2:54:36.080 --> 2:54:41.080]  And he's like larping in the real world, putting out that's a $50,000.
[2:54:41.080 --> 2:54:42.080]  Now it's $75,000.
[2:54:42.080 --> 2:54:44.080]  And they're like, where's Ali Alexander?
[2:54:44.080 --> 2:54:45.080]  All he's not hiding.
[2:54:45.080 --> 2:54:47.080]  He's been on the show four times since then.
[2:54:47.080 --> 2:54:50.080]  He's been banned off of everything, including his bank accounts.
[2:54:50.080 --> 2:55:01.080]  So people like you, Don Wilson or Winslow or Winston Smith or whatever the hell your name is can sit there and lie about him in your echo chamber.
[2:55:01.080 --> 2:55:09.080]  And just thousands of retweets just, oh my God, it's the total proof, kill them, arrest them.
[2:55:09.080 --> 2:55:13.080]  And it's the Georgia State House.
[2:55:13.080 --> 2:55:19.080]  And you know that it's like.
[2:55:19.080 --> 2:55:21.080]  How do we get away from these people?
[2:55:21.080 --> 2:55:23.080]  How do I never have to interface with them?
[2:55:23.080 --> 2:55:24.080]  I guess I can't.
[2:55:24.080 --> 2:55:29.080]  I mean, this is their time as a criminal, crazy, organized, globalist mob.
[2:55:29.080 --> 2:55:32.080]  The new world order is just, hey, we're going crazy.
[2:55:32.080 --> 2:55:34.080]  We're going to attack everybody.
[2:55:34.080 --> 2:55:36.080]  And we're going to lie about you.
[2:55:36.080 --> 2:55:43.080]  And that's just the way it is because we have this existential will to power to project our own hatred of ourselves onto you.
[2:55:43.080 --> 2:55:47.080]  And we're going to get you because we hate ourselves.
[2:55:47.080 --> 2:55:49.080]  And humans need to be exterminated.
[2:55:49.080 --> 2:55:50.080]  There's too many people.
[2:55:50.080 --> 2:55:51.080]  Well, then you go first.
[2:55:51.080 --> 2:55:53.080]  I don't wish you any harm.
[2:55:53.080 --> 2:56:02.080]  But you know, Klaus Schwab and it's wearing his weird ass cult outfit and all this stuff says there's too many people at the age of humans is over and they're making this move.
[2:56:02.080 --> 2:56:04.080]  And I'm just like, then you go first.
[2:56:04.080 --> 2:56:06.080]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[2:56:06.080 --> 2:56:08.080]  Klaus Schwab is a God.
[2:56:08.080 --> 2:56:14.080]  Bill Gates is a God in his mind and they've got to carry out this great thing for the earth.
[2:56:14.080 --> 2:56:19.080]  And it's just crazy to watch everybody bow down to these monsters and put up with that.
[2:56:19.080 --> 2:56:20.080]  And where is that from?
[2:56:20.080 --> 2:56:22.080]  I know you guys gave me an article, but I lost it.
[2:56:22.080 --> 2:56:27.080]  We're like, no Klaus Schwab is not part of the church of Satan.
[2:56:27.080 --> 2:56:29.080]  That's a weird cult university.
[2:56:29.080 --> 2:56:30.080]  It's far worse than that.
[2:56:30.080 --> 2:56:32.080]  I mean, these are cult members.
[2:56:32.080 --> 2:56:44.080]  All right, those two clips straight ahead than Gerald Salente, the pop trans forecaster takes over on the economy and more strap yourselves in.
[2:56:44.080 --> 2:56:49.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've studied history.
[2:56:49.080 --> 2:56:51.080]  I've interviewed all the experts.
[2:56:51.080 --> 2:56:53.080]  I have looked at every facet of this.
[2:56:53.080 --> 2:56:59.080]  And now the only days until the inauguration of the CHICOM agent, it's all coming into place.
[2:56:59.080 --> 2:57:01.080]  That's how they change the subject from election fraud.
[2:57:01.080 --> 2:57:03.080]  It's how they change the subject from Hunter's laptop.
[2:57:03.080 --> 2:57:10.080]  It's how they change the subject from Epstein and Obama and Al Qaeda and the New World Order.
[2:57:10.080 --> 2:57:14.080]  And now use the already martial law in place for COVID-19.
[2:57:14.080 --> 2:57:19.080]  And that's what it is to then be expanded and become political and become permanent.
[2:57:19.080 --> 2:57:21.080]  They train you to stay in your houses.
[2:57:21.080 --> 2:57:22.080]  They train you to be tracked.
[2:57:22.080 --> 2:57:25.080]  They train and do what you're told for nine, 10 months as training wheels.
[2:57:25.080 --> 2:57:27.080]  And now they launched the storm.
[2:57:27.080 --> 2:57:29.080]  The storm is here.
[2:57:29.080 --> 2:57:31.080]  It's a globalist storm.
[2:57:31.080 --> 2:57:33.080]  There's not going to be martial law for Trump.
[2:57:33.080 --> 2:57:35.080]  There's to be martial law for the globalist.
[2:57:35.080 --> 2:57:37.080]  They're trying to set you up.
[2:57:37.080 --> 2:57:38.080]  Don't be involved in violence.
[2:57:38.080 --> 2:57:42.080]  Expose the New World Order and expose the takeover with information.
[2:57:42.080 --> 2:58:08.080]  That's how we beat these people with truth.
[2:58:13.080 --> 2:58:15.080]  Yeah, we'll see how it goes.
[2:58:15.080 --> 2:58:17.080]  Klaus Slav of Bill Gates.
[2:58:17.080 --> 2:58:18.080]  Keep playing God.
[2:58:18.080 --> 2:58:21.080]  I predict you're going to die at a mental institution.
[2:58:21.080 --> 2:58:23.080]  Like all your kind.
[2:58:23.080 --> 2:58:25.080]  Like Nietzsche and all the rest of you.
[2:58:25.080 --> 2:58:27.080]  You uber mentions.
[2:58:27.080 --> 2:58:29.080]  I'm elemental.
[2:58:29.080 --> 2:58:32.080]  My sight is clean.
[2:58:32.080 --> 2:58:34.080]  I am perpetual.
[2:58:34.080 --> 2:58:39.080]  I keep the country free.
[2:58:39.080 --> 2:58:41.080]  All right, let me hit this news.
[2:58:41.080 --> 2:58:43.080]  Because it's crazy.
[2:58:43.080 --> 2:58:45.080]  Look at this headline.
[2:58:45.080 --> 2:58:50.080]  Anti-Trump Lincoln project disavows founder at the revelation that he flirted with 14-year-old boys.
[2:58:50.080 --> 2:58:52.080]  I mean, he tried to pick them up.
[2:58:52.080 --> 2:58:53.080]  A whole bunch of them.
[2:58:53.080 --> 2:58:55.080]  I mean, welcome to Planet Pito.
[2:58:55.080 --> 2:59:03.080]  Biden's advisor to pick the federal judges was accused of physically assaulting children.
[2:59:03.080 --> 2:59:05.080]  Biden picked a run on employment,
[2:59:05.080 --> 2:59:12.080]  and the Nigerian fraudsters till 600 million from Washington state.
[2:59:12.080 --> 2:59:15.080]  And of course, CNN hit the clown.
[2:59:15.080 --> 2:59:23.080]  Stelter argues that the ship is okay when the left does it.
[2:59:23.080 --> 2:59:25.080]  Let's go to this next video.
[2:59:25.080 --> 2:59:28.080]  Biden press secretary, Mrs. Sushi.
[2:59:28.080 --> 2:59:29.080]  Not joking.
[2:59:29.080 --> 2:59:30.080]  That's her name.
[2:59:30.080 --> 2:59:33.080]  Same one that says use the CIA and all Americans.
[2:59:33.080 --> 2:59:36.080]  The press secretary gloats over Trump ban.
[2:59:36.080 --> 2:59:39.080]  Can't say we miss him on Twitter.
[2:59:39.080 --> 2:59:43.080]  So banning the president of the United States is a good thing.
[2:59:43.080 --> 2:59:48.080]  And if you think you're safe when he's not, well, I got a bridge I'm ready to sell you.
[2:59:48.080 --> 2:59:56.080]  So here is, pull up the photo of sad Obama staffers 2017.
[2:59:56.080 --> 3:00:03.080]  Let's show the footage of her of Saki or not to be cool name Sushi.
[3:00:03.080 --> 3:00:04.080]  I'm sorry.
[3:00:04.080 --> 3:00:05.080]  Sushi or Saki?
[3:00:05.080 --> 3:00:06.080]  Saki.
[3:00:06.080 --> 3:00:13.080]  So so Mrs. Mrs. Sushi, Mrs. Mrs. Rotting fish from the head down.
[3:00:13.080 --> 3:00:14.080]  There she is.
[3:00:14.080 --> 3:00:17.080]  Oh, so upset.
[3:00:17.080 --> 3:00:21.080]  Oh, look at those poor little babies, but now they're going to teach America.
[3:00:21.080 --> 3:00:25.080]  They're going to cut your energy off and keep you locked out forever.
[3:00:25.080 --> 3:00:29.080]  Freedom's out forever.
[3:00:29.080 --> 3:00:33.080]  America's been blown to pieces.
[3:00:33.080 --> 3:00:34.080]  So here it is.
[3:00:34.080 --> 3:00:37.080]  Biden press secretary gloats over Trump ban.
[3:00:37.080 --> 3:00:38.080]  Can't say we miss him.
[3:00:38.080 --> 3:00:39.080]  Here she is.
[3:00:39.080 --> 3:00:43.080]  As you know, President Trump has been barred from a lot of social media sites.
[3:00:43.080 --> 3:00:53.080]  Secures whether you think his absence has made your job any easier or the White House's job any easier as it kind of goes forward on these COVID negotiations.
[3:00:53.080 --> 3:00:54.080]  In what way?
[3:00:54.080 --> 3:00:56.080]  Well, he created a lot of noise, right?
[3:00:56.080 --> 3:01:02.080]  He would have certain gravitational pull with Republicans who may be more inclined to take off.
[3:01:02.080 --> 3:01:04.080]  Look how disingenuous she is.
[3:01:04.080 --> 3:01:08.080]  Imagine being married to that sack of filth.
[3:01:08.080 --> 3:01:09.080]  This may be hard to believe.
[3:01:09.080 --> 3:01:12.080]  We don't spend a lot of time talking about or thinking about President Trump here.
[3:01:12.080 --> 3:01:15.080]  Former President Trump should be very clear.
[3:01:15.080 --> 3:01:16.080]  Oh yeah, he's not the president.
[3:01:16.080 --> 3:01:23.080]  I think that's a question that's probably more appropriate for Republican members who are looking for ways to support a bipartisan
[3:01:23.080 --> 3:01:26.080]  package and whether that gives them space.
[3:01:26.080 --> 3:01:28.080]  But I can't say we miss him on Twitter.
[3:01:28.080 --> 3:01:31.080]  Does President Biden support the continuing ban of President Trump?
[3:01:31.080 --> 3:01:32.080]  That's enough.
[3:01:32.080 --> 3:01:34.080]  I want to go to Gerald Salon to hear about it.
[3:01:34.080 --> 3:01:35.080]  One more clip.
[3:01:35.080 --> 3:01:39.080]  Again, they want to silence him so they can lie about him.
[3:01:39.080 --> 3:01:41.080]  That's how it works.
[3:01:41.080 --> 3:01:43.080]  Now here's another one, infowars.com.
[3:01:43.080 --> 3:01:46.080]  Medical doctor lectures explaining face masks aren't effective.
[3:01:46.080 --> 3:01:48.080]  That blocking has gone viral.
[3:01:48.080 --> 3:01:53.080]  They're trying to censor it so that Don Sallows our article on infowars.com.
[3:01:53.080 --> 3:01:59.080]  The Texas-based ophthalmologist goes on to explain there are more protective methods.
[3:01:59.080 --> 3:02:01.080]  But again, all of it's a fraud.
[3:02:01.080 --> 3:02:03.080]  Let's play that clip.
[3:02:03.080 --> 3:02:05.080]  We know what works.
[3:02:05.080 --> 3:02:07.080]  These don't work against viruses.
[3:02:07.080 --> 3:02:08.080]  Regular masks don't work.
[3:02:08.080 --> 3:02:10.080]  That's simply what it is.
[3:02:10.080 --> 3:02:11.080]  It's been shown many times.
[3:02:11.080 --> 3:02:13.080]  It's nothing to do with COVID.
[3:02:13.080 --> 3:02:17.080]  COVID doesn't even factor into the equation because for years we've been looking at these issues.
[3:02:17.080 --> 3:02:19.080]  So they have these spacesuits.
[3:02:19.080 --> 3:02:20.080]  They're called PAPRs.
[3:02:20.080 --> 3:02:21.080]  They're incredibly effective.
[3:02:21.080 --> 3:02:26.080]  They filter viruses down to, I think, the.01 or something like that.
[3:02:26.080 --> 3:02:30.080]  Basically, we have materials like N99 and N100.
[3:02:30.080 --> 3:02:37.080]  But N95 blocks, let's say, only 5% of airborne particles can get through.
[3:02:37.080 --> 3:02:39.080]  But all viruses can get through.
[3:02:39.080 --> 3:02:40.080]  Period.
[3:02:40.080 --> 3:02:41.080]  All viruses can get through.
[3:02:41.080 --> 3:02:42.080]  Now, do they get through?
[3:02:42.080 --> 3:02:44.080]  No, it's just like a chain link fence.
[3:02:44.080 --> 3:02:48.080]  If you throw sand in a chain link fence, not all the sand gets through.
[3:02:48.080 --> 3:02:53.080]  So I think the best example I can say is the reason we wear a mask and the reason I wear a mask,
[3:02:53.080 --> 3:02:59.080]  because the fear is so massive in this country, I wear a mask so people don't think I don't care about them.
[3:02:59.080 --> 3:03:01.080]  Yeah, it's all hysteria.
[3:03:01.080 --> 3:03:03.080]  And now take a vaccine to prove you don't care.
[3:03:03.080 --> 3:03:04.080]  And now never leave your house.
[3:03:04.080 --> 3:03:06.080]  And now you're not essential.
[3:03:06.080 --> 3:03:07.080]  Well, the third world starved to death.
[3:03:07.080 --> 3:03:09.080]  It's immoral to do it.
[3:03:09.080 --> 3:03:13.080]  It's the COVID-19 lockdown, the great reset, a corporate takeover, all the big banks.
[3:03:13.080 --> 3:03:14.080]  And all the big tech.
[3:03:14.080 --> 3:03:15.080]  Double their profits.
[3:03:15.080 --> 3:03:17.080]  And we all go bankrupt.
[3:03:17.080 --> 3:03:19.080]  OK, stop doing it.
[3:03:19.080 --> 3:03:20.080]  Stop submitting.
[3:03:20.080 --> 3:03:22.080]  It's a fraud!
[3:03:22.080 --> 3:03:24.080]  Gerald Salunday is about to take over.
[3:03:24.080 --> 3:03:26.080]  Please, remember, we have a new sale.
[3:03:26.080 --> 3:03:27.080]  That's how we fund this operation.
[3:03:27.080 --> 3:03:28.080]  Plus, these are great products.
[3:03:28.080 --> 3:03:32.080]  DNA Force Plus about to sell out, still discounted.
[3:03:32.080 --> 3:03:34.080]  Ultra 12 got back in stock.
[3:03:34.080 --> 3:03:36.080]  Incredible high quality B12 under the tongue.
[3:03:36.080 --> 3:03:39.080]  Sublingually, it's back in stock.
[3:03:39.080 --> 3:03:41.080]  50% off.
[3:03:41.080 --> 3:03:43.080]  Liquid pure turmeric extract.
[3:03:43.080 --> 3:03:45.080]  About to sell out, still 50% off.
[3:03:45.080 --> 3:03:46.080]  Lung cleanse.
[3:03:46.080 --> 3:03:48.080]  Plus, back in stock, 50% off.
[3:03:48.080 --> 3:03:50.080]  Infowarstore.com.
[3:03:50.080 --> 3:03:53.080]  Or triple A, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[3:03:53.080 --> 3:03:56.080]  And I would get high quality, swarable foods at last 25 years while you're at it as well.
[3:03:56.080 --> 3:03:57.080]  Prepare with Alex.com.
[3:03:57.080 --> 3:04:00.080]  The best tools you're going to find out there on the hottest quality food.
[3:04:00.080 --> 3:04:01.080]  Prepare with Alex.com.
[3:04:01.080 --> 3:04:04.080]  Or go to the sub page of infowarstore.com.
[3:04:04.080 --> 3:04:05.080]  I want to thank the crew.
[3:04:05.080 --> 3:04:08.080]  I want to thank everybody for the great job they're doing now.
[3:04:08.080 --> 3:04:15.080]  The next 46 minutes, 47 minutes, Gerald Salente, the trends forecaster, good friend of mine,
[3:04:15.080 --> 3:04:18.080]  a great patriot, takes over.
[3:04:18.080 --> 3:04:22.080]  And then we've got the War Room coming up today, 3 p.m. Central with Owen Schreuer.
[3:04:22.080 --> 3:04:24.080]  Trendsresearch.com.
[3:04:24.080 --> 3:04:26.080]  Trendsresearch.com.
[3:04:26.080 --> 3:04:28.080]  Gerald Salente takes over.
[3:04:28.080 --> 3:04:30.080]  Thanks so much, Alex.
[3:04:30.080 --> 3:04:32.080]  And thank you for all that you do.
[3:04:32.080 --> 3:04:35.080]  Boy, you really nailed it with that mass clown.
[3:04:35.080 --> 3:04:37.080]  You know, what did the guys say?
[3:04:37.080 --> 3:04:41.080]  Well, the reason I wear a mask, you know, they're ineffective.
[3:04:41.080 --> 3:04:44.080]  But I don't have the courage not to wear one.
[3:04:44.080 --> 3:04:46.080]  And I want to make everybody feel good.
[3:04:46.080 --> 3:04:48.080]  And so I don't want to wear one.
[3:04:48.080 --> 3:04:52.080]  So I wear one for them, even though they're totally useless.
[3:04:52.080 --> 3:04:54.080]  What kind of man is that?
[3:04:54.080 --> 3:04:56.080]  What kind of man is that?
[3:04:56.080 --> 3:04:59.080]  I'm doing it because it's a fraud.
[3:04:59.080 --> 3:05:01.080]  And I'll keep the fraud going.
[3:05:01.080 --> 3:05:03.080]  How about making it clear like that?
[3:05:03.080 --> 3:05:05.080]  How about saying, I'm a doctor.
[3:05:05.080 --> 3:05:07.080]  And I know these things are worthless,
[3:05:07.080 --> 3:05:09.080]  but I'm going to make you feel good
[3:05:09.080 --> 3:05:12.080]  because you're a gutless little clown.
[3:05:12.080 --> 3:05:15.080]  And I like to make gutless little clowns.
[3:05:15.080 --> 3:05:17.080]  I feel like they're not gutless little clowns.
[3:05:17.080 --> 3:05:21.080]  So I have a pair of cojones, maybe the size of a moth ball.
[3:05:21.080 --> 3:05:23.080]  So I'll wear the mask.
[3:05:23.080 --> 3:05:26.080]  Yeah, this is the mask.
[3:05:26.080 --> 3:05:32.080]  This is the mask that the doctor, the doctor.
[3:05:32.080 --> 3:05:34.080]  You know, I'm tired of this crap doctor.
[3:05:34.080 --> 3:05:38.080]  You know, it's like when they report on lawmakers.
[3:05:38.080 --> 3:05:39.080]  What lawmakers?
[3:05:39.080 --> 3:05:43.080]  A bunch of crappy little pieces of garbage
[3:05:43.080 --> 3:05:46.080]  that never worked a day in their life called politicians.
[3:05:46.080 --> 3:05:49.080]  Poly ticks suck the blood out of us.
[3:05:49.080 --> 3:05:55.080]  Oh, and then the people at the inauguration, dignitaries.
[3:05:55.080 --> 3:05:58.080]  What dignitaries?
[3:05:58.080 --> 3:06:02.080]  Little cherry nothings, dignitaries.
[3:06:02.080 --> 3:06:05.080]  Disgusting terries.
[3:06:05.080 --> 3:06:07.080]  Well, you got to give them a good name.
[3:06:07.080 --> 3:06:13.080]  So going back to the doctor, to the doctor.
[3:06:13.080 --> 3:06:16.080]  Read the, read the box.
[3:06:16.080 --> 3:06:17.080]  Read the box.
[3:06:17.080 --> 3:06:19.080]  I don't need the doctor to tell me these things
[3:06:19.080 --> 3:06:21.080]  that the doctor was wearing,
[3:06:21.080 --> 3:06:26.080]  that the doctor wears so he makes people feel good.
[3:06:26.080 --> 3:06:30.080]  These masks do not eliminate exposure
[3:06:30.080 --> 3:06:34.080]  to the risk of any disease or infection.
[3:06:34.080 --> 3:06:38.080]  And there are no studies out there at all
[3:06:38.080 --> 3:06:42.080]  on wearing these damn things constantly
[3:06:42.080 --> 3:06:45.080]  and what they're doing to your health.
[3:06:45.080 --> 3:06:48.080]  Besides your mental health
[3:06:48.080 --> 3:06:50.080]  and what they're doing to little kids
[3:06:50.080 --> 3:06:54.080]  freaking them out when it is big.
[3:06:54.080 --> 3:06:57.080]  Putting this crap on them.
[3:06:57.080 --> 3:07:00.080]  And again, we've been writing about this
[3:07:00.080 --> 3:07:03.080]  over and over and over and over in the Trends Journal.
[3:07:03.080 --> 3:07:05.080]  All the details are there.
[3:07:05.080 --> 3:07:08.080]  We even quoted this New England Journal of Medicine
[3:07:08.080 --> 3:07:10.080]  one after another.
[3:07:10.080 --> 3:07:12.080]  How about the Denmark study?
[3:07:12.080 --> 3:07:14.080]  Oh, no, now the doctor said it.
[3:07:14.080 --> 3:07:17.080]  So take the Denmark study that came out in November
[3:07:17.080 --> 3:07:20.080]  and shove it.
[3:07:20.080 --> 3:07:21.080]  This is ridiculous.
[3:07:21.080 --> 3:07:22.080]  What's going on?
[3:07:22.080 --> 3:07:24.080]  They have destroyed life.
[3:07:24.080 --> 3:07:26.080]  They sucked the joy out of it
[3:07:26.080 --> 3:07:29.080]  and they've set us in for the greatest depression.
[3:07:29.080 --> 3:07:30.080]  That little clown Cuomo.
[3:07:30.080 --> 3:07:32.080]  Daddy's boy, daddy's boy.
[3:07:32.080 --> 3:07:33.080]  He's nothing if daddy.
[3:07:33.080 --> 3:07:34.080]  Was it Mario?
[3:07:34.080 --> 3:07:37.080]  So listen, do what you can to support Info Wars.
[3:07:37.080 --> 3:07:38.080]  Buy those products.
[3:07:38.080 --> 3:07:39.080]  They're important.
[3:07:39.080 --> 3:07:40.080]  Keep Truth Alive.
[3:07:40.080 --> 3:07:43.080]  And we're going to be right back.
[3:07:43.080 --> 3:07:45.080]  The Post Industrial World.
[3:07:45.080 --> 3:07:48.080]  That's what George Herbert Walker Bush signed on to
[3:07:48.080 --> 3:07:54.080]  at the Rio de Janeiro Agenda 21 conference back in 1992.
[3:07:54.080 --> 3:07:57.080]  Now they've launched Agenda 2030,
[3:07:57.080 --> 3:07:59.080]  which is a post industrial world.
[3:07:59.080 --> 3:08:01.080]  Plough Schwab with the Davos Group.
[3:08:01.080 --> 3:08:03.080]  Trudeau, the Prime Minister of Canada.
[3:08:03.080 --> 3:08:08.080]  They're all on record saying the great reset is Agenda 2030.
[3:08:08.080 --> 3:08:11.080]  Well, you might want to find out what Agenda 2030 is.
[3:08:11.080 --> 3:08:14.080]  It is the destruction of society as we know it.
[3:08:14.080 --> 3:08:16.080]  It is making the population poor.
[3:08:16.080 --> 3:08:19.080]  By designs, we can be controlled with a medical
[3:08:19.080 --> 3:08:22.080]  technocracy over you and your family.
[3:08:22.080 --> 3:08:24.080]  They're destroying civilization.
[3:08:24.080 --> 3:08:27.080]  Rebuild it in their dystopic image.
[3:08:27.080 --> 3:08:32.080]  We are fighting this at infowars.com and newswars.com.
[3:08:32.080 --> 3:08:34.080]  We are fighting for a pro-human future.
[3:08:34.080 --> 3:08:37.080]  And we need you to keep the facts, to research and share
[3:08:37.080 --> 3:08:39.080]  with others and join the fight.
[3:08:39.080 --> 3:08:40.080]  God bless you.
[3:08:40.080 --> 3:08:41.080]  Visit us.
[3:08:41.080 --> 3:08:43.080]  Spread the word at infowars.com.
[3:08:43.080 --> 3:08:45.080]  Mountain Patriot in Colorado.
[3:08:45.080 --> 3:08:46.080]  Thank you for holding.
[3:08:46.080 --> 3:08:47.080]  Hey, man.
[3:08:47.080 --> 3:08:48.080]  How you doing, Alex?
[3:08:48.080 --> 3:08:49.080]  Man, I'm just working as hard as I can.
[3:08:49.080 --> 3:08:50.080]  We're in such a critical time.
[3:08:50.080 --> 3:08:51.080]  Brother, how are you?
[3:08:51.080 --> 3:08:52.080]  I love you, man.
[3:08:52.080 --> 3:08:55.080]  I want to make a quick plug, that DNA force.
[3:08:55.080 --> 3:08:56.080]  I love it.
[3:08:56.080 --> 3:08:58.080]  I've been using it quite a while, and I just went,
[3:08:58.080 --> 3:09:00.080]  looked at the ingredients again the other day,
[3:09:00.080 --> 3:09:03.080]  and I see that it contains quercetin,
[3:09:03.080 --> 3:09:06.080]  which according to some published studies
[3:09:06.080 --> 3:09:10.080]  that Dr. Merkala has cited, is an ionophore
[3:09:10.080 --> 3:09:12.080]  similar to hydroxychloroquine,
[3:09:12.080 --> 3:09:15.080]  and it helps channel the zinc into the cells.
[3:09:15.080 --> 3:09:18.080]  So people might want to take a look at that.
[3:09:18.080 --> 3:09:21.080]  All I know is with DNA force,
[3:09:21.080 --> 3:09:24.080]  we went out and looked at these high-end products
[3:09:24.080 --> 3:09:26.080]  that they sell through doctor clinics
[3:09:26.080 --> 3:09:27.080]  that aren't prescription,
[3:09:27.080 --> 3:09:29.080]  but the doctor sells like 300 bucks a bottle,
[3:09:29.080 --> 3:09:30.080]  because there's a lot of expensive product,
[3:09:30.080 --> 3:09:32.080]  and it's really only costing like 50 bucks.
[3:09:32.080 --> 3:09:35.080]  And so we basically cloned two different top brands together,
[3:09:35.080 --> 3:09:37.080]  and that's what produced this.
[3:09:37.080 --> 3:09:39.080]  So thanks, thanks for the plug.
[3:09:39.080 --> 3:09:42.080]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:10:09.080 --> 3:10:11.080]  1776.
[3:10:11.080 --> 3:10:14.080]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[3:10:14.080 --> 3:10:18.080]  with Gerald Salente.
[3:10:18.080 --> 3:10:20.080]  Hello, hello, hello.
[3:10:20.080 --> 3:10:22.080]  Alex Jones show.
[3:10:22.080 --> 3:10:24.080]  I wear a mask.
[3:10:24.080 --> 3:10:26.080]  You can feel good.
[3:10:26.080 --> 3:10:29.080]  Can you imagine a guy saying something like that?
[3:10:29.080 --> 3:10:32.080]  Anyway, okay, here's the big news.
[3:10:32.080 --> 3:10:34.080]  Game stop.
[3:10:34.080 --> 3:10:37.080]  Stop the game.
[3:10:37.080 --> 3:10:40.080]  It's one of our top trends in 2021.
[3:10:40.080 --> 3:10:44.080]  We come out with our top trends in 2021,
[3:10:44.080 --> 3:10:48.080]  and I believe it was the first week of,
[3:10:48.080 --> 3:10:51.080]  or second week, I think it was the first week of December.
[3:10:51.080 --> 3:10:53.080]  We do it each year,
[3:10:53.080 --> 3:10:55.080]  but no later than the 8th or the 10th.
[3:10:55.080 --> 3:10:59.080]  And one of them this year is Youth Revolution.
[3:10:59.080 --> 3:11:01.080]  There it is.
[3:11:01.080 --> 3:11:03.080]  Youth Revolution right in front of you.
[3:11:03.080 --> 3:11:06.080]  And that's what's going on.
[3:11:06.080 --> 3:11:09.080]  Game stop is to stop the game.
[3:11:09.080 --> 3:11:11.080]  They've had it.
[3:11:11.080 --> 3:11:13.080]  The young people that have a brain,
[3:11:13.080 --> 3:11:15.080]  the people that had turned into infowars,
[3:11:15.080 --> 3:11:22.080]  that young crowd of vigor and free minds,
[3:11:22.080 --> 3:11:25.080]  the people that subscribed to our magazine,
[3:11:25.080 --> 3:11:29.080]  they know it's all a bunch of baloney out there.
[3:11:29.080 --> 3:11:32.080]  We all know the numbers.
[3:11:32.080 --> 3:11:37.080]  26 people in the world got more dough
[3:11:37.080 --> 3:11:40.080]  than half the world's population.
[3:11:40.080 --> 3:11:42.080]  26 people.
[3:11:42.080 --> 3:11:47.080]  And as Alex said, you know, the great reset.
[3:11:47.080 --> 3:11:51.080]  These little slimy lowlife pieces of garbage,
[3:11:51.080 --> 3:11:59.080]  scum crap politicians locking down everywhere.
[3:11:59.080 --> 3:12:01.080]  You're not an essential business.
[3:12:01.080 --> 3:12:03.080]  I'll tell you who's an essential business.
[3:12:03.080 --> 3:12:06.080]  I'm little gruesome Gavin Newsom.
[3:12:06.080 --> 3:12:10.080]  I'm slimy little Cuomo.
[3:12:10.080 --> 3:12:13.080]  I'm a little witless Whitmere.
[3:12:13.080 --> 3:12:17.080]  I'll tell you little peoples of slave landia.
[3:12:17.080 --> 3:12:20.080]  What an essential business is.
[3:12:20.080 --> 3:12:22.080]  It's Walmart's.
[3:12:22.080 --> 3:12:25.080]  It's Costco.
[3:12:25.080 --> 3:12:26.080]  It's Target.
[3:12:26.080 --> 3:12:29.080]  They give us a lot of money.
[3:12:29.080 --> 3:12:34.080]  Idiots and morons call it campaign contributions.
[3:12:34.080 --> 3:12:40.080]  Adults call it bribes and payoffs.
[3:12:40.080 --> 3:12:42.080]  So what happens?
[3:12:42.080 --> 3:12:44.080]  They shut down everybody.
[3:12:44.080 --> 3:12:52.080]  But there's no social distancing in the big chains.
[3:12:52.080 --> 3:12:55.080]  No, no, no.
[3:12:55.080 --> 3:12:59.080]  You could do whatever you want.
[3:12:59.080 --> 3:13:03.080]  But the little people is shafted.
[3:13:03.080 --> 3:13:08.080]  And so the young people, you can't open up your own business.
[3:13:08.080 --> 3:13:11.080]  Get it out of your head.
[3:13:11.080 --> 3:13:18.080]  You're going to stock shelves of Bezos.
[3:13:18.080 --> 3:13:22.080]  You're going to be a cashier until they get it all automated
[3:13:22.080 --> 3:13:26.080]  at Walmart.
[3:13:26.080 --> 3:13:28.080]  You're not going to have a living.
[3:13:28.080 --> 3:13:34.080]  It's not the land opportunity.
[3:13:34.080 --> 3:13:40.080]  Almost a third of young people have lost their jobs.
[3:13:40.080 --> 3:13:43.080]  No future.
[3:13:43.080 --> 3:13:46.080]  It's the youth revolution.
[3:13:46.080 --> 3:13:47.080]  They've had it.
[3:13:47.080 --> 3:13:52.080]  They're tired of all fat people and other slimmers
[3:13:52.080 --> 3:13:55.080]  grabbing everything and giving them nothing.
[3:13:55.080 --> 3:13:58.080]  Hey, how about that guy, Steve Cohen?
[3:13:58.080 --> 3:14:00.080]  Oh, yeah, the big hedge fund guy.
[3:14:00.080 --> 3:14:02.080]  Hedge fund?
[3:14:02.080 --> 3:14:04.080]  How about criminal operations?
[3:14:04.080 --> 3:14:07.080]  When I was a kid, these things didn't exist.
[3:14:07.080 --> 3:14:10.080]  Hedge funds, private equity groups.
[3:14:10.080 --> 3:14:14.080]  Yeah, a bunch of gangsters getting together to screw you
[3:14:14.080 --> 3:14:17.080]  and steal everything.
[3:14:17.080 --> 3:14:20.080]  And when the young people fight back,
[3:14:20.080 --> 3:14:25.080]  we need more laws on the Nasdaq.
[3:14:25.080 --> 3:14:27.080]  Yeah, we need more.
[3:14:27.080 --> 3:14:31.080]  We got to regulate the little people
[3:14:31.080 --> 3:14:34.080]  because they're going to start getting money
[3:14:34.080 --> 3:14:37.080]  that we're trying to steal all of it.
[3:14:37.080 --> 3:14:42.080]  You heard the Nasdaq clown the other last week telling that.
[3:14:42.080 --> 3:14:44.080]  Oh, how terrible this is.
[3:14:44.080 --> 3:14:46.080]  Yeah, the bigs could short the market.
[3:14:46.080 --> 3:14:50.080]  Oh, how about the JP Morgan Chase gang?
[3:14:50.080 --> 3:14:54.080]  The little slimy low lives that got caught rigging
[3:14:54.080 --> 3:14:58.080]  the precious metals markets only got a slap on the wrist,
[3:14:58.080 --> 3:15:02.080]  only paid $900 million to screwing people
[3:15:02.080 --> 3:15:07.080]  after all those years of rigging the precious metals market.
[3:15:07.080 --> 3:15:13.080]  That's OK, but not the little people, not the little people.
[3:15:13.080 --> 3:15:15.080]  No, no, no.
[3:15:15.080 --> 3:15:17.080]  This is the youth revolution.
[3:15:17.080 --> 3:15:19.080]  They've had it.
[3:15:19.080 --> 3:15:21.080]  They know they have no future.
[3:15:21.080 --> 3:15:25.080]  If they're living with mommy and daddy, they can't get a job.
[3:15:25.080 --> 3:15:29.080]  They brought us Bitcoin.
[3:15:29.080 --> 3:15:31.080]  They brought us Bitcoin.
[3:15:31.080 --> 3:15:34.080]  They brought us cryptocurrencies.
[3:15:34.080 --> 3:15:39.080]  Now they're fighting the bigs on the market front.
[3:15:39.080 --> 3:15:43.080]  This is just the beginning of the youth revolution.
[3:15:43.080 --> 3:15:54.080]  They're going to be anti-tax, anti-vax, anti-big and pro-free,
[3:15:54.080 --> 3:15:57.080]  freedom, peace and justice.
[3:15:57.080 --> 3:16:01.080]  These are the people that are going to turn this around.
[3:16:01.080 --> 3:16:05.080]  It was one of our top trends before this happened.
[3:16:05.080 --> 3:16:07.080]  You know, I tell people, they call me a futurist.
[3:16:07.080 --> 3:16:10.080]  I'm not a futurist. Nobody could predict the future.
[3:16:10.080 --> 3:16:13.080]  There are too many wild cards.
[3:16:13.080 --> 3:16:20.080]  Who would have ever thought game stop, stop the game, stop the game?
[3:16:20.080 --> 3:16:26.080]  Who would have ever dreamt that that would have happened?
[3:16:26.080 --> 3:16:29.080]  But you can see the big picture.
[3:16:29.080 --> 3:16:34.080]  And the big picture is youth revolution.
[3:16:34.080 --> 3:16:40.080]  2021, off with their heads, 2.0.
[3:16:40.080 --> 3:16:42.080]  They've had it.
[3:16:42.080 --> 3:16:45.080]  And when people lose everything and have nothing left to lose,
[3:16:45.080 --> 3:16:47.080]  they lose it.
[3:16:47.080 --> 3:16:49.080]  And they've lost their future.
[3:16:49.080 --> 3:16:55.080]  It has been stolen from them by the repulsive kids and the demo
[3:16:55.080 --> 3:17:00.080]  craps, the slimy, low life, worthless politicians.
[3:17:00.080 --> 3:17:06.080]  How could anybody with a mind bigger than a symbol or a P?
[3:17:06.080 --> 3:17:13.080]  Look up to a Mitch McConnell, bow down to a Pelosi,
[3:17:13.080 --> 3:17:17.080]  suck up to a Lindsey Graham,
[3:17:17.080 --> 3:17:23.080]  march off to a little chucky, crappy Schumer,
[3:17:23.080 --> 3:17:25.080]  run after another.
[3:17:25.080 --> 3:17:28.080]  The freak show is in front of your eyes.
[3:17:28.080 --> 3:17:30.080]  They are freaks.
[3:17:30.080 --> 3:17:32.080]  Look at them.
[3:17:32.080 --> 3:17:35.080]  Oh, I forgot about Diane, not so fine, Stein.
[3:17:35.080 --> 3:17:38.080]  Oh, over there in Europe, you got little Katzone McCrone.
[3:17:38.080 --> 3:17:42.080]  How about nothing Sanchez?
[3:17:42.080 --> 3:17:44.080]  Merkel.
[3:17:44.080 --> 3:17:46.080]  Freak shows.
[3:17:46.080 --> 3:17:50.080]  It's a freak show.
[3:17:50.080 --> 3:17:54.080]  And they destroyed our lives.
[3:17:54.080 --> 3:17:55.080]  Yep.
[3:17:55.080 --> 3:17:57.080]  There we are.
[3:17:57.080 --> 3:18:01.080]  Military militarized United States of America,
[3:18:01.080 --> 3:18:05.080]  just like every other country these days.
[3:18:05.080 --> 3:18:10.080]  I had had protested riots in Russia yesterday or Sunday.
[3:18:10.080 --> 3:18:11.080]  Yeah, yesterday.
[3:18:11.080 --> 3:18:15.080]  Oh, did the media go after that?
[3:18:15.080 --> 3:18:18.080]  Oh, cops with batons.
[3:18:18.080 --> 3:18:20.080]  Yeah, just like here.
[3:18:20.080 --> 3:18:21.080]  Just like here.
[3:18:21.080 --> 3:18:23.080]  Freedom has been robbed from us.
[3:18:23.080 --> 3:18:27.080]  And the young people, the youth revolution has begun.
[3:18:27.080 --> 3:18:29.080]  Game stop.
[3:18:29.080 --> 3:18:30.080]  Stop the game.
[3:18:30.080 --> 3:18:32.080]  Game over.
[3:18:32.080 --> 3:18:34.080]  This is the beginning.
[3:18:34.080 --> 3:18:37.080]  Again, support info wars.
[3:18:37.080 --> 3:18:40.080]  Put your money where your heart is.
[3:18:40.080 --> 3:18:41.080]  We're going to be right back.
[3:18:41.080 --> 3:18:44.080]  We told you it was coming under the United Nations pilot
[3:18:44.080 --> 3:18:46.080]  program in Singapore for eight months.
[3:18:46.080 --> 3:18:49.080]  They've made citizens wear bracelets on their arms
[3:18:49.080 --> 3:18:52.080]  that make them a social distance and report them back
[3:18:52.080 --> 3:18:54.080]  to cell towers to track through every movement.
[3:18:54.080 --> 3:18:55.080]  This is for everybody.
[3:18:55.080 --> 3:18:56.080]  The way it gets better.
[3:18:56.080 --> 3:18:59.080]  Now France has programs in their factories,
[3:18:59.080 --> 3:19:02.080]  government bush and sponsor, to make everyone wear
[3:19:02.080 --> 3:19:05.080]  actual dog collars that can make you social distance
[3:19:05.080 --> 3:19:07.080]  and report back to single computers.
[3:19:07.080 --> 3:19:09.080]  They're turning us into a commodity.
[3:19:09.080 --> 3:19:11.080]  Human animal clones have been around for 50 years.
[3:19:11.080 --> 3:19:13.080]  It's all being announced.
[3:19:13.080 --> 3:19:15.080]  They are literally taking over the life cycle of humans
[3:19:15.080 --> 3:19:17.080]  and making us obsolete.
[3:19:17.080 --> 3:19:19.080]  And big corporations now claim that they own us
[3:19:19.080 --> 3:19:22.080]  with these gene therapy systems and patents that they produced.
[3:19:22.080 --> 3:19:24.080]  Do you understand?
[3:19:24.080 --> 3:19:27.080]  It is a takeover of the entire species at the genetic level.
[3:19:27.080 --> 3:19:29.080]  And now they're coming with dog collars.
[3:19:29.080 --> 3:19:31.080]  And they're announcing in public schools in the U.S.
[3:19:31.080 --> 3:19:33.080]  starting next year it will begin.
[3:19:33.080 --> 3:19:34.080]  Did you hear me?
[3:19:34.080 --> 3:19:37.080]  Dog collars for your children all based on a hoax,
[3:19:37.080 --> 3:19:38.080]  all based on a lie.
[3:19:38.080 --> 3:19:41.080]  Info wars continue to spread the word to fight back.
[3:19:41.080 --> 3:19:45.080]  President Trump won in a landslide on November 3.
[3:19:45.080 --> 3:19:48.080]  But the globalists weren't going to let that happen.
[3:19:48.080 --> 3:19:52.080]  They had to have some way to repudiate the populist movement
[3:19:52.080 --> 3:19:56.080]  emanating from the United States that spread across the world
[3:19:56.080 --> 3:19:58.080]  from the U.K. to Brazil.
[3:19:58.080 --> 3:19:59.080]  They were desperate.
[3:19:59.080 --> 3:20:01.080]  They admitted their own publications.
[3:20:01.080 --> 3:20:03.080]  They didn't know what to do.
[3:20:03.080 --> 3:20:05.080]  And so they put out 80 million fake ballots,
[3:20:05.080 --> 3:20:09.080]  violated state law and stole it better than death.
[3:20:09.080 --> 3:20:11.080]  And now they're coming after the president.
[3:20:11.080 --> 3:20:12.080]  They're coming after you.
[3:20:12.080 --> 3:20:13.080]  They're coming after me.
[3:20:13.080 --> 3:20:15.080]  They're shutting everybody off the Internet.
[3:20:15.080 --> 3:20:17.080]  They're trying to totally censor us.
[3:20:17.080 --> 3:20:19.080]  And that's why info wars is still in the fight
[3:20:19.080 --> 3:20:21.080]  because we knew this was coming.
[3:20:21.080 --> 3:20:22.080]  We told you this was coming.
[3:20:22.080 --> 3:20:25.080]  We were the first main target and we're still on air.
[3:20:25.080 --> 3:20:28.080]  At infowars.com and newswars.com and band on video.
[3:20:28.080 --> 3:20:30.080]  Without your word of mouth and without your prayer,
[3:20:30.080 --> 3:20:32.080]  without your financial support, we can't stay on air.
[3:20:32.080 --> 3:20:35.080]  So while you still can, go to infowarstore.com
[3:20:35.080 --> 3:20:37.080]  and get storeable foods, my quality products,
[3:20:37.080 --> 3:20:41.080]  supplements, you name it, at infowarstore.com.
[3:20:41.080 --> 3:20:42.080]  I've got some bad news.
[3:20:42.080 --> 3:20:45.080]  Our best-selling vitamin mineral fusion has sold out
[3:20:45.080 --> 3:20:47.080]  because people understand in these stressful times
[3:20:47.080 --> 3:20:49.080]  it's now more important than ever to boost
[3:20:49.080 --> 3:20:51.080]  your body's natural defenses.
[3:20:51.080 --> 3:20:52.080]  Here's the good news.
[3:20:52.080 --> 3:20:55.080]  Turmeric acts in very similar ways
[3:20:55.080 --> 3:20:58.080]  and is so good for inflammation, so good for your immune system.
[3:20:58.080 --> 3:21:01.080]  And we've got two great turmeric formulas.
[3:21:01.080 --> 3:21:03.080]  One is body's ultimate turmeric formula
[3:21:03.080 --> 3:21:05.080]  that is a dried turmeric extract,
[3:21:05.080 --> 3:21:07.080]  95% humanoid.
[3:21:07.080 --> 3:21:08.080]  People love it.
[3:21:08.080 --> 3:21:09.080]  That's selling out.
[3:21:09.080 --> 3:21:12.080]  Despite that, it's still discounted at infowarstore.com.
[3:21:12.080 --> 3:21:14.080]  And then also selling out this week
[3:21:14.080 --> 3:21:16.080]  is our liquid turmeric extract.
[3:21:16.080 --> 3:21:18.080]  It's called liquid turmeric extract.
[3:21:18.080 --> 3:21:19.080]  People really love it.
[3:21:19.080 --> 3:21:21.080]  It's extremely strong as well.
[3:21:21.080 --> 3:21:22.080]  It's selling out.
[3:21:22.080 --> 3:21:25.080]  And your purchase doesn't just help yourself and your body.
[3:21:25.080 --> 3:21:28.080]  It also funds the info war and keeps us on air
[3:21:28.080 --> 3:21:30.080]  while they're trying to shut everybody down.
[3:21:30.080 --> 3:21:31.080]  So thank you all for your support.
[3:21:31.080 --> 3:21:34.080]  Please visit infowarstore.com
[3:21:34.080 --> 3:21:36.080]  and find so many other great items
[3:21:36.080 --> 3:21:38.080]  that will enrich yourself and your family's life
[3:21:38.080 --> 3:21:39.080]  and fund the info war.
[3:21:39.080 --> 3:22:08.080]  God bless and good luck.
[3:22:09.080 --> 3:22:14.080]  Harold Solente.
[3:22:14.080 --> 3:22:19.080]  A great being on the outskirts.
[3:22:19.080 --> 3:22:21.080]  You guys don't know Trump's support of it.
[3:22:21.080 --> 3:22:24.080]  To me, this election was rigged right in front of our eyes.
[3:22:24.080 --> 3:22:29.080]  You saw it pulling boxes out from under the tables on and on.
[3:22:29.080 --> 3:22:33.080]  And they're stopping a populist movement.
[3:22:33.080 --> 3:22:35.080]  And that's what this Youth Revolution is about.
[3:22:35.080 --> 3:22:37.080]  It's about a populist movement.
[3:22:37.080 --> 3:22:40.080]  And censorship is real.
[3:22:40.080 --> 3:22:43.080]  It was one of our top trends in 2019.
[3:22:43.080 --> 3:22:47.080]  We said this censorship is going to be escalating quite rapidly.
[3:22:47.080 --> 3:22:48.080]  And now we're here.
[3:22:48.080 --> 3:22:51.080]  So it's really up to you to keep the truth alive.
[3:22:51.080 --> 3:22:55.080]  And now, of course, they're coming out with the BS line
[3:22:55.080 --> 3:22:56.080]  of domestic terrorism.
[3:22:56.080 --> 3:22:59.080]  If you disagree with anything that they say,
[3:22:59.080 --> 3:23:01.080]  it's domestic terrorism.
[3:23:01.080 --> 3:23:04.080]  And I want to put this really back into context.
[3:23:04.080 --> 3:23:08.080]  Think about it, between the police and the cops and the troops
[3:23:08.080 --> 3:23:16.080]  in D.C., the whole place is locked down on Ignorgeration Day
[3:23:16.080 --> 3:23:22.080]  because there were protests against an illegal vote.
[3:23:22.080 --> 3:23:23.080]  What?
[3:23:23.080 --> 3:23:26.080]  Some 74 million people thought that the thing was rigged.
[3:23:26.080 --> 3:23:30.080]  If this happened in another country,
[3:23:30.080 --> 3:23:33.080]  and you saw these pictures,
[3:23:33.080 --> 3:23:38.080]  because people were protesting that the election was rigged,
[3:23:38.080 --> 3:23:42.080]  this would be an excuse for slimy little lowlife pieces
[3:23:42.080 --> 3:23:47.080]  of garbage, scum crap, like George W. Bush,
[3:23:47.080 --> 3:23:50.080]  another daddy's boy, probably with a pair of Cajones
[3:23:50.080 --> 3:23:52.080]  small and a mothball.
[3:23:52.080 --> 3:23:57.080]  Nobody, if daddy wasn't Georgie,
[3:23:57.080 --> 3:23:59.080]  attack a foreign nation.
[3:23:59.080 --> 3:24:00.080]  Look at this.
[3:24:00.080 --> 3:24:01.080]  This is America.
[3:24:01.080 --> 3:24:05.080]  Yeah, A-N-E-R-I-K-A.
[3:24:05.080 --> 3:24:06.080]  America?
[3:24:06.080 --> 3:24:09.080]  If you saw this in another country,
[3:24:09.080 --> 3:24:13.080]  another slimy little lowlife piece of garbage,
[3:24:13.080 --> 3:24:16.080]  scum crap, like the war monger Nobel Peace
[3:24:16.080 --> 3:24:19.080]  of Crap Prize winner Barack Obama,
[3:24:19.080 --> 3:24:22.080]  that guy, Gaddafi, I want a man in there.
[3:24:22.080 --> 3:24:24.080]  Now, so if there's another country,
[3:24:24.080 --> 3:24:26.080]  I want that guy Biden in there.
[3:24:26.080 --> 3:24:29.080]  Look what he's done to America to land it free.
[3:24:29.080 --> 3:24:32.080]  He's militarized the whole nation.
[3:24:32.080 --> 3:24:36.080]  We got to attack that country and bring freedom back.
[3:24:36.080 --> 3:24:38.080]  And the people would march off.
[3:24:38.080 --> 3:24:40.080]  Yeah, yeah, look at this.
[3:24:40.080 --> 3:24:44.080]  This is not my America.
[3:24:44.080 --> 3:24:47.080]  Hi, Biden.
[3:24:47.080 --> 3:24:49.080]  Oh, I made you get banned for that.
[3:24:49.080 --> 3:24:52.080]  Oh, there he is with the Nobel Peace of Crap Prize winner,
[3:24:52.080 --> 3:24:53.080]  giving him a medal.
[3:24:53.080 --> 3:24:55.080]  Yep.
[3:24:55.080 --> 3:24:57.080]  Yeah, great job.
[3:24:57.080 --> 3:25:00.080]  Murderers, not a war you didn't love.
[3:25:00.080 --> 3:25:05.080]  If you saw what happened in America on a
[3:25:05.080 --> 3:25:10.080]  inauguration day in another nation that these sick people
[3:25:10.080 --> 3:25:12.080]  wanted to overthrow the government,
[3:25:12.080 --> 3:25:17.080]  they would use that showing all the military around
[3:25:17.080 --> 3:25:19.080]  as a reason to overthrow it.
[3:25:19.080 --> 3:25:22.080]  So this is why you have to support Info Wars
[3:25:22.080 --> 3:25:23.080]  to keep the truth alive.
[3:25:23.080 --> 3:25:26.080]  And they got some great products out there.
[3:25:26.080 --> 3:25:31.080]  And as we feel at that turbo charge,
[3:25:31.080 --> 3:25:33.080]  you got to get that charge.
[3:25:33.080 --> 3:25:39.080]  The turbo charge is your defenses with this incredible new sale.
[3:25:39.080 --> 3:25:43.080]  So because of the slow destruction of the supply chain,
[3:25:43.080 --> 3:25:46.080]  you know, we're having to end sales on some of their
[3:25:46.080 --> 3:25:48.080]  fan favorite products,
[3:25:48.080 --> 3:25:52.080]  but they want you to be able to turbo charge your body's
[3:25:52.080 --> 3:25:55.080]  natural defenses less.
[3:25:55.080 --> 3:25:58.080]  They're bringing you fresh new sales on other classic
[3:25:58.080 --> 3:26:00.080]  Info Wars live products.
[3:26:00.080 --> 3:26:04.080]  DNA force plus it's selling out fast 25% off.
[3:26:04.080 --> 3:26:09.080]  Ultra 12, it back in stock 50% off.
[3:26:09.080 --> 3:26:13.080]  Liquid, pure turmeric extract,
[3:26:13.080 --> 3:26:16.080]  turmeric, I shouldn't say for 50% off.
[3:26:16.080 --> 3:26:20.080]  Lung cleanses plus back in stock 50% off.
[3:26:20.080 --> 3:26:23.080]  Look, the biggest thing you can do for your body's defenses
[3:26:23.080 --> 3:26:26.080]  is supplementing and empowering them.
[3:26:26.080 --> 3:26:29.080]  You never hear that in the news.
[3:26:29.080 --> 3:26:33.080]  Even though DNA force plus is selling out quickly,
[3:26:33.080 --> 3:26:37.080]  they're keeping it at 25% off for an affordable advantage
[3:26:37.080 --> 3:26:39.080]  for your natural defenses.
[3:26:39.080 --> 3:26:41.080]  And that's what you have to do.
[3:26:41.080 --> 3:26:43.080]  You have to build up your natural defenses,
[3:26:43.080 --> 3:26:45.080]  build up your immune system,
[3:26:45.080 --> 3:26:47.080]  and that COVID won't get you maybe.
[3:26:47.080 --> 3:26:48.080]  Can't say that.
[3:26:48.080 --> 3:26:50.080]  Maybe they locked me up for saying that.
[3:26:50.080 --> 3:26:53.080]  And with bodies now out of stock,
[3:26:53.080 --> 3:26:57.080]  you can get turmeric in a new way

[3:27:08.080 --> 3:27:11.080]  You can get both of these powerhouse products

[3:27:32.080 --> 3:27:34.080]  if you want to get ahead of the game and stay healthy.
[3:27:34.080 --> 3:27:36.080]  Again, you never hear a word,
[3:27:36.080 --> 3:27:39.080]  not a peep from the prostitutes,
[3:27:39.080 --> 3:27:41.080]  the little prostitute days
[3:27:41.080 --> 3:27:45.080]  who get paid to put out by their corporate pimps,
[3:27:45.080 --> 3:27:47.080]  the little Donny Lemmins,
[3:27:47.080 --> 3:27:49.080]  perfect name for that lemon,
[3:27:49.080 --> 3:27:53.080]  that sour piece of crap from the Cartoon News Network,
[3:27:53.080 --> 3:27:55.080]  a little prostitute day,
[3:27:55.080 --> 3:28:00.080]  like little Chrissy Cuomo, a daddy's boy, be nobody.
[3:28:00.080 --> 3:28:03.080]  I used to know him. I knew his father.
[3:28:03.080 --> 3:28:04.080]  When I used to be on CNN,
[3:28:04.080 --> 3:28:06.080]  I used to be on CNN like four times a month,
[3:28:06.080 --> 3:28:07.080]  back in the day,
[3:28:07.080 --> 3:28:09.080]  then they bring Chris Cuomo around here,
[3:28:09.080 --> 3:28:10.080]  two aides with him.
[3:28:10.080 --> 3:28:11.080]  Hey, Chris, how you doing?
[3:28:11.080 --> 3:28:12.080]  Oh, good, good.
[3:28:12.080 --> 3:28:15.080]  Who's doing sports and pop culture?
[3:28:15.080 --> 3:28:16.080]  All right.
[3:28:16.080 --> 3:28:18.080]  I like this father, by the way.
[3:28:18.080 --> 3:28:19.080]  I like Maria,
[3:28:19.080 --> 3:28:23.080]  but the little boys, the little zeros,
[3:28:23.080 --> 3:28:27.080]  prostitute days get paid to put out.
[3:28:27.080 --> 3:28:31.080]  You got to keep the truth alive.
[3:28:31.080 --> 3:28:32.080]  And they're going to do everything
[3:28:32.080 --> 3:28:36.080]  with this domestic terrorism bill to shut us down.
[3:28:36.080 --> 3:28:37.080]  It's only going to be time
[3:28:37.080 --> 3:28:40.080]  before they knock me off YouTube.
[3:28:40.080 --> 3:28:44.080]  I know it.
[3:28:44.080 --> 3:28:47.080]  They're going to do everything they can.
[3:28:47.080 --> 3:28:50.080]  So when you talk about building your immune system,
[3:28:50.080 --> 3:28:52.080]  that's against the law.
[3:28:52.080 --> 3:28:55.080]  You got to get the vaccination.
[3:28:55.080 --> 3:28:56.080]  You got to get, you know,
[3:28:56.080 --> 3:28:58.080]  they should have a vaccination
[3:28:58.080 --> 3:29:00.080]  where you bend over and get it,
[3:29:00.080 --> 3:29:03.080]  because that's all that's happening.
[3:29:03.080 --> 3:29:05.080]  Then it will look perfect.
[3:29:05.080 --> 3:29:08.080]  It will look perfect.
[3:29:08.080 --> 3:29:12.080]  Bend over and get that vaccination.
[3:29:12.080 --> 3:29:15.080]  So do you care to support info wars?
[3:29:15.080 --> 3:29:17.080]  I'm talking before about, you know,
[3:29:17.080 --> 3:29:21.080]  the youth revolution and with Bitcoin.
[3:29:21.080 --> 3:29:23.080]  It's it's happening.
[3:29:23.080 --> 3:29:26.080]  You're now you're seeing J.P. Morgan
[3:29:26.080 --> 3:29:28.080]  to launch digital bank.
[3:29:28.080 --> 3:29:31.080]  Got it.
[3:29:31.080 --> 3:29:35.080]  They know that they're in trouble
[3:29:35.080 --> 3:29:41.080]  and they will fight the youth to their death
[3:29:41.080 --> 3:29:43.080]  and they will kill anybody that they want
[3:29:43.080 --> 3:29:45.080]  any time anywhere.
[3:29:45.080 --> 3:29:51.080]  Money's number one.
[3:29:51.080 --> 3:29:59.080]  So as we're looking ahead at the markets,
[3:29:59.080 --> 3:30:04.080]  the youth revolution can be that wild card
[3:30:04.080 --> 3:30:08.080]  that brings down these phony markets.
[3:30:08.080 --> 3:30:11.080]  What they're doing now to push silver prices up
[3:30:11.080 --> 3:30:14.080]  because the slimmers are shorting it
[3:30:14.080 --> 3:30:17.080]  because they don't want precious metals to be precious.
[3:30:17.080 --> 3:30:20.080]  They want digital crap.
[3:30:20.080 --> 3:30:26.080]  They want J.P. Morgan digital trash.
[3:30:26.080 --> 3:30:30.080]  Got to get rid of that dirty cash.
[3:30:30.080 --> 3:30:35.080]  So this can change everything
[3:30:35.080 --> 3:30:37.080]  as info wars is saying.
[3:30:37.080 --> 3:30:39.080]  And so are we.
[3:30:39.080 --> 3:30:42.080]  This is a whole new game.
[3:30:42.080 --> 3:30:44.080]  Precious metals.
[3:30:44.080 --> 3:30:47.080]  We called silver's rise before this, by the way,
[3:30:47.080 --> 3:30:52.080]  in June when silver was selling at 17 bucks.
[3:30:52.080 --> 3:30:54.080]  We said it was going to spike
[3:30:54.080 --> 3:30:57.080]  at a higher percentage rate than gold
[3:30:57.080 --> 3:30:59.080]  before this happened.
[3:30:59.080 --> 3:31:01.080]  Before the youth revolution,
[3:31:01.080 --> 3:31:05.080]  it was hovering around 25.
[3:31:05.080 --> 3:31:08.080]  And now it's spiking higher.
[3:31:08.080 --> 3:31:12.080]  And we have forecast that silver's going to go
[3:31:12.080 --> 3:31:14.080]  over $50 an ounce this year,
[3:31:14.080 --> 3:31:17.080]  gold over 2100,
[3:31:17.080 --> 3:31:20.080]  and the banksters will do everything to kill it.
[3:31:20.080 --> 3:31:23.080]  And that's why you have to support info wars
[3:31:23.080 --> 3:31:24.080]  to keep the truth alive
[3:31:24.080 --> 3:31:26.080]  and subscribe to the Trends Bureau.
[3:31:26.080 --> 3:31:27.080]  Know the magazine like it.
[3:31:27.080 --> 3:31:29.080]  Last week, 134 pages.
[3:31:29.080 --> 3:31:31.080]  No ads.
[3:31:31.080 --> 3:31:33.080]  People want to know what's happening.
[3:31:33.080 --> 3:31:34.080]  We're telling them.
[3:31:34.080 --> 3:31:36.080]  And we're going to tell you more when we get back.
[3:31:36.080 --> 3:31:38.080]  And remember,
[3:31:38.080 --> 3:31:58.080]  infowars.com.
[3:32:09.080 --> 3:32:11.080]  Many competitors sleep formulas
[3:32:11.080 --> 3:32:13.080]  focus only on getting you to sleep,
[3:32:13.080 --> 3:32:15.080]  but Rocket Rest was specifically formulated
[3:32:15.080 --> 3:32:17.080]  to help you feel rested
[3:32:17.080 --> 3:32:19.080]  and ready to take on the next day.
[3:32:19.080 --> 3:32:22.080]  It uses a unique quick release capsule system
[3:32:22.080 --> 3:32:25.080]  to ensure fast delivery of deep sleep support ingredients
[3:32:25.080 --> 3:32:27.080]  like melatonin and magnesium.
[3:32:27.080 --> 3:32:29.080]  Rocket Rest helps you fall asleep fast,
[3:32:29.080 --> 3:32:32.080]  stay asleep, and wake up feeling rested.
[3:32:32.080 --> 3:32:34.080]  So get the new Rocket Rest formula
[3:32:34.080 --> 3:32:36.080]  from Dr. Jones Naturals right now
[3:32:36.080 --> 3:32:39.080]  at infowarstore.com.
[3:33:06.080 --> 3:33:08.080]  This is a very technical day.
[3:33:08.080 --> 3:33:10.080]  But it's a day to make our soldiers Superman.
[3:33:10.080 --> 3:33:12.080]  It's a way to make it sexy that, hey,
[3:33:12.080 --> 3:33:14.080]  we're experimenting on our troops.
[3:33:14.080 --> 3:33:16.080]  We'll send things with that into our troops.
[3:33:16.080 --> 3:33:18.080]  And thousands and thousands have died
[3:33:18.080 --> 3:33:21.080]  each time they tried a new experimental vaccine.
[3:33:21.080 --> 3:33:23.080]  And I've talked to high-level folks
[3:33:23.080 --> 3:33:24.080]  inside the federal government
[3:33:24.080 --> 3:33:26.080]  and have the state of Texas health department.
[3:33:26.080 --> 3:33:28.080]  They say Alex will know it hurts a lot of people,
[3:33:28.080 --> 3:33:29.080]  but it's for a greater good.
[3:33:29.080 --> 3:33:31.080]  But that's not even true.
[3:33:31.080 --> 3:33:33.080]  And it violates the Geneva Convention,
[3:33:33.080 --> 3:33:35.080]  the Nuremberg Code, federal state law.
[3:33:35.080 --> 3:33:42.080]  and we have a right to resist it with any means necessary.
[3:34:05.080 --> 3:34:10.080]  Why every month we launch a new URL before they ban it.
[3:34:10.080 --> 3:34:14.080]  But Soros and Bill Gates and the Globalists are on our tail.
[3:34:14.080 --> 3:34:17.080]  But the new website is
[3:34:17.080 --> 3:34:19.080]  TheResistance.video
[3:34:19.080 --> 3:34:21.080]  TheResistance.video
[3:34:21.080 --> 3:34:25.080]  They're trying to block us because the truth is powerful and can defeat them.
[3:34:25.080 --> 3:34:28.080]  So the new URL that links right to ban.video
[3:34:28.080 --> 3:34:31.080]  and all of our videos and all of our documentaries
[3:34:31.080 --> 3:34:34.080]  and all the special reports and all the suppressed information
[3:34:34.080 --> 3:34:36.080]  is at TheResistance.video
[3:34:36.080 --> 3:34:37.080]  Share the link
[3:34:37.080 --> 3:34:39.080]  TheResistance.video
[3:34:39.080 --> 3:35:06.080]  TheResistance.video
[3:35:09.080 --> 3:35:11.080]  TheResistance.video
[3:35:39.080 --> 3:35:41.080]  TheResistance.video
[3:35:41.080 --> 3:35:44.080]  Share the link
[3:35:44.080 --> 3:35:47.080]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:36:01.080 --> 3:36:03.080]  Waging war on corruption.
[3:36:03.080 --> 3:36:05.080]  It's Gerald Salente.
[3:36:05.080 --> 3:36:08.080]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:36:08.080 --> 3:36:12.320]  Hello, hello, it's me, Alex Dunn Show.
[3:36:12.320 --> 3:36:15.360]  And again, do what you can to keep the truth alive.
[3:36:15.360 --> 3:36:16.200]  This is serious.
[3:36:16.200 --> 3:36:18.200]  They're going to domestic terrorism.
[3:36:18.200 --> 3:36:19.880]  They're coming out with it.
[3:36:19.880 --> 3:36:21.320]  And you can see what they're doing.
[3:36:21.320 --> 3:36:22.840]  They militarized.
[3:36:22.840 --> 3:36:25.040]  We became a militarized country.
[3:36:25.040 --> 3:36:26.760]  This never happened.
[3:36:26.760 --> 3:36:28.720]  I mean, it happened when I was a young guy.
[3:36:28.720 --> 3:36:31.800]  You know, when the demonstrations were going on.
[3:36:31.800 --> 3:36:37.760]  And, you know, but what's going on now,
[3:36:37.760 --> 3:36:42.920]  that militarized, what was it going to do on election,
[3:36:42.920 --> 3:36:44.840]  on inauguration night?
[3:36:44.840 --> 3:36:49.120]  Militaries in 50 states?
[3:36:49.120 --> 3:36:50.280]  And this is unprecedented.
[3:36:50.280 --> 3:36:51.880]  They're going to rob us of our freedom.
[3:36:51.880 --> 3:36:52.880]  They're doing it.
[3:36:52.880 --> 3:36:55.280]  They're doing it in front of our eyes.
[3:36:55.280 --> 3:36:56.440]  Again, look at this.
[3:36:56.440 --> 3:36:58.040]  This is America?
[3:36:58.040 --> 3:37:00.000]  America?
[3:37:00.000 --> 3:37:02.600]  Oh, and the cops now have these kind of things, too.
[3:37:02.600 --> 3:37:06.040]  Isn't that wonderful, huh?
[3:37:06.040 --> 3:37:09.280]  So support info wars, support the Trends Journal.
[3:37:09.280 --> 3:37:13.800]  We're doing everything we can to keep truth alive.
[3:37:13.800 --> 3:37:19.400]  And our mission is freedom, peace, and justice.
[3:37:19.400 --> 3:37:23.200]  Anyway, going back to the markets,
[3:37:23.200 --> 3:37:25.000]  everyone knows that they're rigged.
[3:37:25.000 --> 3:37:28.160]  We got Gregory Manorino writing for us in the Trends Journal.
[3:37:28.160 --> 3:37:30.400]  This guy's really on top of things.
[3:37:30.400 --> 3:37:35.240]  And, you know, adding to what we've been writing
[3:37:35.240 --> 3:37:37.560]  and putting a whole other level in different areas
[3:37:37.560 --> 3:37:42.160]  and regarding stocks and trading that we weren't doing.
[3:37:42.160 --> 3:37:45.160]  And it's one big bubble.
[3:37:45.160 --> 3:37:46.240]  Everybody knows it.
[3:37:46.240 --> 3:37:47.200]  Everybody knows it.
[3:37:47.200 --> 3:37:48.920]  You know where the money's running now, too?
[3:37:48.920 --> 3:37:50.160]  Into emerging markets.
[3:37:50.160 --> 3:37:52.800]  Emerging markets have sunk into nothing.
[3:37:52.800 --> 3:37:55.080]  They're gambling in those now.
[3:37:55.080 --> 3:37:59.160]  So we're saying this because when
[3:37:59.160 --> 3:38:02.280]  you look at how the markets closed out January,
[3:38:02.280 --> 3:38:03.640]  they closed out on a low note.
[3:38:03.640 --> 3:38:07.480]  Now there are 600 points down in a couple of days each.
[3:38:07.480 --> 3:38:09.600]  This thing is volatile.
[3:38:09.600 --> 3:38:13.920]  And the Youth Revolution, what they're doing with GameStop,
[3:38:13.920 --> 3:38:17.120]  what they're doing with Silver, they
[3:38:17.120 --> 3:38:19.640]  can bring down some of these big hedge funds.
[3:38:19.640 --> 3:38:22.960]  So at the end, the big hedge funds will outbeat them.
[3:38:22.960 --> 3:38:27.360]  But they could destroy a lot in the meantime.
[3:38:27.360 --> 3:38:31.200]  This could be the wild card that brings down the equity markets.
[3:38:31.200 --> 3:38:35.240]  It's big because they should have crashed a long time ago.
[3:38:35.240 --> 3:38:36.920]  The Federal Reserve is buying up what?
[3:38:36.920 --> 3:38:45.920]  $120 billion worth of junk bonds.
[3:38:45.920 --> 3:38:49.880]  They're buying bonds, including junk bonds every month.
[3:38:49.880 --> 3:38:52.760]  Some ridiculous number, $80 billion, $120 billion,
[3:38:52.760 --> 3:38:55.560]  some moronic number.
[3:38:55.560 --> 3:39:00.480]  So this thing could come down very hard and fast.
[3:39:00.480 --> 3:39:02.320]  They've locked down the global economy, which
[3:39:02.320 --> 3:39:04.840]  going on is unprecedented.
[3:39:04.840 --> 3:39:06.720]  The Congressional Budget Office today.
[3:39:06.720 --> 3:39:09.160]  Big news, big news on CNBC.
[3:39:09.160 --> 3:39:17.040]  Big news that by 2022, it will recover.
[3:39:17.040 --> 3:39:20.520]  The jobs that have been lost will come back.
[3:39:20.520 --> 3:39:25.200]  OK, and Basil, the jobs that have been lost will come back.
[3:39:25.200 --> 3:39:33.200]  In two years, a year and a half, you're not creating any new jobs.
[3:39:33.200 --> 3:39:35.200]  Got it?
[3:39:35.200 --> 3:39:37.200]  Got it?
[3:39:37.200 --> 3:39:41.200]  So they inflate it by saying, oh, the jobs, it'll be lost will come back.
[3:39:41.200 --> 3:39:45.200]  New jobs aren't being created.
[3:39:45.200 --> 3:39:48.200]  And the jobs stink.
[3:39:48.200 --> 3:39:50.200]  They don't pay any money.
[3:39:50.200 --> 3:39:55.200]  They don't pay any money.
[3:39:55.200 --> 3:39:59.200]  We're going to give you a $15 and a guaranteed wage.
[3:39:59.200 --> 3:40:01.200]  A big deal.
[3:40:01.200 --> 3:40:03.200]  But that's part of the great reset.
[3:40:03.200 --> 3:40:04.200]  You have enough money.
[3:40:04.200 --> 3:40:05.200]  You don't have to work.
[3:40:05.200 --> 3:40:06.200]  You'd be all right.
[3:40:06.200 --> 3:40:07.200]  You could live like a pauper.
[3:40:07.200 --> 3:40:10.200]  It's all right.
[3:40:10.200 --> 3:40:13.200]  I want to go a little direction here just to show you
[3:40:13.200 --> 3:40:15.200]  why you should listen to Info Wars
[3:40:15.200 --> 3:40:19.200]  and why you should subscribe to The Trends Journal.
[3:40:19.200 --> 3:40:22.200]  You know what I think about the Turley paper,
[3:40:22.200 --> 3:40:24.200]  a record, the New York Times?
[3:40:24.200 --> 3:40:27.200]  They call themselves the paper of record.
[3:40:27.200 --> 3:40:28.200]  The paper of record.
[3:40:28.200 --> 3:40:33.200]  Hey, remember that Saddam Hussein?
[3:40:33.200 --> 3:40:37.200]  Yeah, selling the lie that he had these aluminum tubes coming up there
[3:40:37.200 --> 3:40:39.200]  that was making weapons.
[3:40:39.200 --> 3:40:44.200]  Yeah, that those slimy toilet paper record New York Times.
[3:40:44.200 --> 3:40:53.200]  This is a story that they ran yesterday.
[3:40:53.200 --> 3:41:00.200]  Ready?
[3:41:00.200 --> 3:41:01.200]  Big story.
[3:41:01.200 --> 3:41:02.200]  Right there.
[3:41:02.200 --> 3:41:04.200]  Sit.
[3:41:04.200 --> 3:41:08.200]  Sit.
[3:41:08.200 --> 3:41:10.200]  Vulnerable communities.
[3:41:10.200 --> 3:41:13.200]  Quote, it's numbing.
[3:41:13.200 --> 3:41:20.200]  Nine nuns die in Michigan outbreak.
[3:41:20.200 --> 3:41:24.200]  The religious sisters who lived in retired seclusion
[3:41:24.200 --> 3:41:27.200]  in a Dominican life center in Michigan
[3:41:27.200 --> 3:41:34.200]  followed strict rules to avoid the outbreak of coronavirus infection.
[3:41:34.200 --> 3:41:37.200]  But after months, after being kept at bay,
[3:41:37.200 --> 3:41:39.200]  it found its way.
[3:41:39.200 --> 3:41:43.200]  Look how they write like little stupid imbeciles.
[3:41:43.200 --> 3:41:47.200]  Christine Hauser and Concepción de Leon.
[3:41:47.200 --> 3:41:51.200]  How about two pieces of prostitute crap?
[3:41:51.200 --> 3:41:55.200]  What kind of kitty crap language is that?
[3:41:55.200 --> 3:41:57.200]  But the nuns die.
[3:41:57.200 --> 3:41:59.200]  The nuns die.
[3:41:59.200 --> 3:42:01.200]  Oh, for nuns dies.
[3:42:01.200 --> 3:42:02.200]  Dominican nuns.
[3:42:02.200 --> 3:42:06.200]  I could tell you a story about a Dominican nun.
[3:42:06.200 --> 3:42:10.200]  Sister Marie Rose there made she rotten hell
[3:42:10.200 --> 3:42:14.200]  for what she did to me.
[3:42:14.200 --> 3:42:16.200]  I'm in the fifth grade school.
[3:42:16.200 --> 3:42:18.200]  My brother may rest in peace,
[3:42:18.200 --> 3:42:20.200]  talk me to go into Catholic school
[3:42:20.200 --> 3:42:23.200]  so I would get some discipline
[3:42:23.200 --> 3:42:26.200]  because they couldn't control me.
[3:42:26.200 --> 3:42:28.200]  And one day she's the principal of the school.
[3:42:28.200 --> 3:42:30.200]  She grabs me by my little blue tie.
[3:42:30.200 --> 3:42:33.200]  Bam, bam, bam, bam.
[3:42:33.200 --> 3:42:36.200]  Blew out my middle ear and perforated my middle ear
[3:42:36.200 --> 3:42:40.200]  and blew out my ear drum.
[3:42:40.200 --> 3:42:43.200]  You know what that did to me as a kid?
[3:42:43.200 --> 3:42:44.200]  I was the toughest kid.
[3:42:44.200 --> 3:42:45.200]  I was a kid from the Bronx.
[3:42:45.200 --> 3:42:48.200]  She moved to Yonkers.
[3:42:48.200 --> 3:42:49.200]  I learned how to fight.
[3:42:49.200 --> 3:42:50.200]  I was the toughest little kid
[3:42:50.200 --> 3:42:51.200]  because I was a small kid.
[3:42:51.200 --> 3:42:53.200]  I learned how to fight right away.
[3:42:53.200 --> 3:42:56.200]  Lost my confidence since she left me back
[3:42:56.200 --> 3:42:59.200]  and I became the stupidest kid in the school.
[3:42:59.200 --> 3:43:01.200]  I used to water ski at 10 years old
[3:43:01.200 --> 3:43:03.200]  and the Hudson River was just a belt on,
[3:43:03.200 --> 3:43:04.200]  going over the wakes of ships.
[3:43:04.200 --> 3:43:07.200]  I could never get my ears wet again.
[3:43:07.200 --> 3:43:12.200]  So anyway, going back to the Dominican nuns,
[3:43:12.200 --> 3:43:20.200]  then you read the story all the way down here.
[3:43:20.200 --> 3:43:26.200]  Sister Janine Teresa was 86.
[3:43:26.200 --> 3:43:32.200]  Esther Ortega died on June 14.
[3:43:32.200 --> 3:43:34.200]  She was 86.
[3:43:34.200 --> 3:43:38.200]  Darthea Gramlich was 81.
[3:43:38.200 --> 3:43:44.200]  Sister Ann Reena Shinkley, 87.
[3:43:44.200 --> 3:43:51.200]  Mary Ann or Mary Irene Wichmeyer, 94.
[3:43:51.200 --> 3:43:55.200]  And Sister Margaret Ann Swallow, 97.
[3:43:55.200 --> 3:43:59.200]  Well, or she didn't make it to 98.
[3:43:59.200 --> 3:44:01.200]  What are you telling me this crap for?
[3:44:01.200 --> 3:44:03.200]  I'll tell you why, because we're selling fear
[3:44:03.200 --> 3:44:06.200]  in hysteria, salinity, and we're prostitutes
[3:44:06.200 --> 3:44:08.200]  we get paid to put out.
[3:44:08.200 --> 3:44:11.200]  We're corporate whores, the lemons,
[3:44:11.200 --> 3:44:15.200]  the limbs, the thiss, the thats.
[3:44:15.200 --> 3:44:17.200]  Yeah.
[3:44:17.200 --> 3:44:22.200]  Go back to your trends journal.
[3:44:22.200 --> 3:44:25.200]  It's several weeks ago.
[3:44:25.200 --> 3:44:27.200]  Forget about what's going on in Yemen.
[3:44:27.200 --> 3:44:28.200]  Who cares about Tigray?
[3:44:28.200 --> 3:44:30.200]  Are the French finally leaving Mali
[3:44:30.200 --> 3:44:33.200]  after they try to gain control over their colony?
[3:44:33.200 --> 3:44:34.200]  Nope.
[3:44:34.200 --> 3:44:36.200]  A big story in last week's New York Times.
[3:44:36.200 --> 3:44:38.200]  The toilet paper, a record.
[3:44:38.200 --> 3:44:43.200]  Only good for cleaning up crap.
[3:44:43.200 --> 3:44:45.200]  It was a convent near Albany, New York,
[3:44:45.200 --> 3:44:48.200]  not far from me, which announced last week
[3:44:48.200 --> 3:44:50.200]  that a COVID outbreak in December
[3:44:50.200 --> 3:44:53.200]  brought 47 residents coming down with the virus,
[3:44:53.200 --> 3:44:56.200]  including nine nuns who died.
[3:44:56.200 --> 3:45:00.200]  Those who died were between the ages of 84 and 98 years old.
[3:45:00.200 --> 3:45:01.200]  All right?
[3:45:01.200 --> 3:45:03.200]  All right?
[3:45:03.200 --> 3:45:04.200]  All right?
[3:45:04.200 --> 3:45:09.200]  They're selling fear in hysteria.
[3:45:09.200 --> 3:45:11.200]  And you've got to read the whole damn article
[3:45:11.200 --> 3:45:14.200]  and get to the end of it to show you how old they were.
[3:45:14.200 --> 3:45:16.200]  And that's who this virus is killing,
[3:45:16.200 --> 3:45:19.200]  and that's why the young people have had it.
[3:45:19.200 --> 3:45:22.200]  This is a sick old person's disease,
[3:45:22.200 --> 3:45:25.200]  or if you're obese, type 2 diabetics,
[3:45:25.200 --> 3:45:27.200]  and we're number one.
[3:45:27.200 --> 3:45:29.200]  We're number one.
[3:45:29.200 --> 3:45:31.200]  40% of Americans are obese.
[3:45:31.200 --> 3:45:36.200]  70% they're overweight, eating crap.
[3:45:36.200 --> 3:45:39.200]  That's why you've got to support InfoWars.
[3:45:39.200 --> 3:45:41.200]  And that's why you need these products
[3:45:41.200 --> 3:45:44.200]  to keep you healthy.
[3:45:44.200 --> 3:45:46.200]  And that's why you need to buy the truth.
[3:45:46.200 --> 3:45:50.200]  Put your money away in your heart where your mind is.
[3:45:50.200 --> 3:45:52.200]  Subscribe to The Trends Journal.
[3:45:52.200 --> 3:45:54.200]  We're putting out information that's going to help you prepare.
[3:45:54.200 --> 3:45:56.200]  What's happening in the future is like nothing.
[3:45:56.200 --> 3:45:58.200]  I'm at this 40 years.
[3:45:58.200 --> 3:45:59.200]  I'm a trend forecaster.
[3:45:59.200 --> 3:46:01.200]  I see the future.
[3:46:01.200 --> 3:46:03.200]  I don't know exactly what it'll look like,
[3:46:03.200 --> 3:46:06.200]  but I know it's hell on Earth if we don't change it.
[3:46:06.200 --> 3:46:09.200]  And it's up to you to make it happen peacefully.
[3:46:09.200 --> 3:46:11.200]  Freedom, peace, and justice.
[3:46:11.200 --> 3:46:13.200]  Freedom, peace, and justice.
[3:46:13.200 --> 3:46:16.200]  And that's what the Youth Revolution is.
[3:46:16.200 --> 3:46:17.200]  Just us.
[3:46:17.200 --> 3:46:21.200]  Not those old clowns that want everything.
[3:46:21.200 --> 3:46:23.200]  See you next week.
[3:46:23.200 --> 3:46:26.200]  Thanks for tuning in.
[3:46:26.200 --> 3:46:49.200]  See you next week.

[3:47:56.200 --> 3:47:58.200]  See you next week.
[3:48:26.200 --> 3:48:30.200]  You might just want to find out who this villain is.
