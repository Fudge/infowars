[00:00.000 --> 00:12.780]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.780 --> 00:21.200]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex
[00:21.200 --> 00:27.520]  jones the really important news today from the Associated Press man hospitalized
[00:27.520 --> 00:33.480]  after winning eggnog chugging contest just a couple cups of eggnog makes me
[00:33.480 --> 00:38.240]  want to throw up so thick it tastes great can you imagine though if our
[00:38.240 --> 00:42.160]  broadcast was just fluff news like that it'd probably be pretty entertaining but
[00:42.160 --> 00:47.680]  nevertheless we won't be discussing any eggnog chugging contest here today we
[00:47.680 --> 00:51.400]  will be discussing the serious sociological and economic developments
[00:51.400 --> 00:57.360]  taking place across the world ABC News reports after NYC deaths of police
[00:57.360 --> 01:04.000]  officers a surge of support for police rocker John Bon Jovi Donna New York
[01:04.000 --> 01:08.760]  police department t-shirt on stage well-wishers delivered home baked cookies
[01:08.760 --> 01:13.040]  by the hundreds to police in Cincinnati in Morrisville North Carolina police and
[01:13.040 --> 01:20.080]  sheriff's officers were treated by residents to a chilly dinner at a time
[01:20.080 --> 01:22.520]  when many in the nation's police community fill in battle the Americans
[01:22.520 --> 01:26.480]  and cities and towns across the country are making an effort to express support
[01:26.480 --> 01:30.880]  and gratitude and that sounds good on the surface and overall I think it's
[01:30.880 --> 01:33.880]  good for the public to reach out to police police reach out to the public
[01:33.880 --> 01:37.720]  the the social engineers want to set each other's throats and divide and
[01:37.720 --> 01:45.120]  conquer but by by by Democratic Party socialists financed basically mind
[01:45.120 --> 01:49.480]  controlled idiots going out and shooting innocent police and cold blood it will
[01:49.480 --> 01:54.160]  then cause an us against them mentality of just totally joining one side of the
[01:54.160 --> 01:59.200]  other and there are massive abuses going on inside governmental systems
[01:59.200 --> 02:05.280]  across the board not just police so it short circuits the debate into just
[02:05.280 --> 02:10.120]  debating police versus citizens instead of everything else going on above that
[02:10.120 --> 02:19.720]  and the divide and conquer is playing off quite nicely right now they're trying
[02:19.720 --> 02:23.440]  to divide the lines by police and whites on one side and everybody else on the
[02:23.440 --> 02:27.080]  other when this country's already basically majority minority in most
[02:27.080 --> 02:32.040]  areas of the nation it needs to be about a culture based on Bill of Rights
[02:32.040 --> 02:38.760]  Constitution not what color you are or what all your other beliefs are in my
[02:38.760 --> 02:42.800]  view it needs to be first we agree on free market we agree on private property
[02:42.800 --> 02:49.440]  we agree on due process we agree on not having barbarism like you have in
[02:49.440 --> 02:53.760]  Chicago and New York and DC with the gunbands we want to give the individual
[02:53.760 --> 02:58.760]  the best shot at being empowered and that means letting the individual struggle
[02:58.760 --> 03:04.600]  as well because history has shown diversity makes men prosperity makes
[03:04.600 --> 03:09.720]  monsters to quote Victor Hugo one of my favorite people to quote and I'm here to
[03:09.720 --> 03:15.080]  tell you no army can stop an idea whose time has come we've got so much news
[03:15.080 --> 03:25.280]  today I saw this report on info wars dot com yesterday and I thought man this is
[03:25.280 --> 03:30.280]  one of Paul Watson's best reports and then sure enough it was on drudge
[03:30.280 --> 03:38.400]  report dot com this morning middle column was FBI wrong on North Korea Sony
[03:38.400 --> 03:43.040]  was not just hacked this is a company that was essentially nuked from the
[03:43.040 --> 03:51.280]  inside CBS news is now been forced to report was the FBI wrong on North Korea
[03:51.280 --> 03:54.600]  of course they were ladies and gentlemen on purpose it was the FBI
[03:54.600 --> 04:01.480]  originally that came out and said it was an inside job two weeks ago two weeks
[04:01.480 --> 04:06.000]  ago and Paul Watson has the article in his video report that drudge is linked
[04:06.000 --> 04:10.720]  to marketing scam Sony to show the interview on Christmas Day in theaters
[04:10.720 --> 04:15.800]  and I intuitively guess it'd be Alamo draft house nationwide and boom I was
[04:15.800 --> 04:20.880]  correct because I know the Alamo was bucking I know the owner to try to air
[04:20.880 --> 04:25.080]  it even in and try to demand Sony give it to them so they were the first to
[04:25.080 --> 04:32.480]  reach out but this is a total example of a stage managed event and remember we
[04:32.480 --> 04:36.680]  told you weeks ago that we believed it was an inside job somebody leaking in
[04:36.680 --> 04:41.520]  that it couldn't be North Korea and we were right again right again
[04:41.520 --> 04:47.200]  ho ho ho Merry Christmas not being arrogant another side issue Paul's
[04:47.200 --> 04:51.360]  been working for me for 13 years he said I'm not a public personality I'm not
[04:51.360 --> 04:55.640]  gonna go on your show I'm not gonna do reports he does reports now does as good
[04:55.640 --> 05:01.280]  a job as I do so see I was right again I made him do it 2015 is almost here and

[08:18.560 --> 08:26.560]  I'm afraid when they pull that game and I hope that judging fly
[08:26.560 --> 08:30.560]  I'm a rebel by morning I'm a rebel
[08:30.560 --> 08:36.840]  well this whole Sony hacking story broke about two weeks ago and day one I came on
[08:36.840 --> 08:42.880]  air and I said it was probably coordinated between the Obama
[08:42.880 --> 08:48.520]  administration Homeland Security the NSA to try to reintroduce Syspa and
[08:48.520 --> 08:57.040]  Sopa and expand the cyber commands funding from around 50 billion a year to
[08:57.040 --> 09:04.400]  even more about 50 billion out of the 200 billion or so so-called intelligence
[09:04.400 --> 09:11.880]  budget that rolls into the 500 plus billion dollar defense budget and when
[09:11.880 --> 09:14.920]  I bring these points up I'm going to show you an article where we put this out
[09:14.920 --> 09:19.360]  last Friday by Kit Daniels just one of many articles I want to explain
[09:19.360 --> 09:27.280]  something it's not arrogance it is confidence I'm here to try to instill
[09:27.280 --> 09:36.920]  confidence in the audience and in new leaders out there to realize you are
[09:36.920 --> 09:43.640]  the resistance you have power not just Alex Jones not just a world net daily or
[09:43.640 --> 09:52.640]  a Matt drudge at drudge report calm not just a Michael Savage you have power in
[09:52.640 --> 10:02.400]  your area before I get into all this news I said earlier I said we were right
[10:02.400 --> 10:06.080]  about this again it's it's now basically admitted it was an inside leak not a
[10:06.080 --> 10:11.480]  hack of Sony I saw Obama in a press conference this morning say we can't
[10:11.480 --> 10:17.360]  let dictators dictate to us what we put out good job Sony saying you're now
[10:17.360 --> 10:21.920]  going to release the movie on Christmas Day total hype we're going to play that
[10:21.920 --> 10:26.960]  clip in a moment but instead of just looking at what the enemy does we have
[10:26.960 --> 10:31.160]  to realize how often we're right not because we're even that smart but we're
[10:31.160 --> 10:35.640]  actually looking for the truth we see the patterns we see the motives we see
[10:35.640 --> 10:44.600]  the means it's a basic investigation and so I remember Paul's been working with
[10:44.600 --> 10:53.920]  me since 2001 13 years and Paul would basically write articles about my radio
[10:53.920 --> 10:59.640]  show on his own website propaganda matrix calm and he's a microcosm of
[10:59.640 --> 11:04.520]  myself and you and everybody else and going back about six seven years ago I
[11:04.520 --> 11:07.280]  tried to make him come on the radio as a guest he said I'm just a writer I don't
[11:07.280 --> 11:12.680]  want to do it then I told him I said listen I've given you pay raises and
[11:12.680 --> 11:17.080]  stuff you're going to start doing weekly videos for prison planet TV and
[11:17.080 --> 11:21.240]  you're going to start coming on my radio show and you're going to develop
[11:21.240 --> 11:25.320]  yourself or I'm going to find somebody else as much as I care about you I'm
[11:25.320 --> 11:31.360]  not going to just sit there and let you stagnate as a writer Paul Watson has now
[11:31.360 --> 11:37.240]  been on national CBS ABC coast-to-coast AM repeatedly his articles get picked up
[11:37.240 --> 11:46.920]  and quoted in the BBC Der Spiegel Russian news US news every week and he was 20
[11:46.920 --> 11:57.640]  years old when I hired him he's now what 33 30 something years old that is a
[11:57.640 --> 12:01.120]  microcosm his brother's got a political science international relations
[12:01.120 --> 12:07.560]  degree he does work as well I'm trying to spur Steve Watson to step up and
[12:07.560 --> 12:12.040]  become a media personality because people just don't want the info they
[12:12.040 --> 12:17.080]  want it delivered by an individual who over the years they learn to trust and
[12:17.080 --> 12:23.280]  who they develop a relationship with so I'm talking about media theory here for
[12:23.280 --> 12:28.360]  my own grassroots organic perspective before I even get into all this news Paul
[12:28.360 --> 12:36.320]  Watson's article is on drudgereport.com today and this morning I saw it at the
[12:36.320 --> 12:39.640]  top of yahoo news
[12:40.920 --> 12:47.640]  there it is LinkedIn red marketing scam drudgereport.com so need to show the
[12:47.640 --> 12:52.280]  interview on Christmas Day in theaters and I saw this report last night when
[12:52.280 --> 12:56.840]  he put it out and I thought man that's a really good report I'm going to play
[12:56.840 --> 13:05.120]  that when I go on air tomorrow and I had an extreme feeling of satisfaction like
[13:05.120 --> 13:09.840]  when you see your son or daughter graduate college or when you I guess
[13:09.840 --> 13:13.120]  they in full metal jacket which is based on a lot of historical things that
[13:13.120 --> 13:16.880]  happened even though it's fiction and the research with the pleasure the drill
[13:16.880 --> 13:22.640]  sergeants have when they see the the the recruits at graduation in their youth
[13:22.640 --> 13:29.120]  meaner and tougher than even they are that's the spirit of victory that's
[13:29.120 --> 13:33.160]  what we should be looking for to build up alternative media to build up
[13:33.160 --> 13:38.000]  personalities to build up leaders of every race color creed male female you
[13:38.000 --> 13:44.200]  name it to where we may not agree on everything gay straight whatever the
[13:44.200 --> 13:49.640]  issue is black white old young male female but we all should agree that we
[13:49.640 --> 13:54.640]  want freedom for the average person to live their life as they see fit as long
[13:54.640 --> 13:59.280]  as they don't hurt somebody else that's the libertarian Thomas Jefferson
[13:59.280 --> 14:06.360]  maxim a true liberal maxim but you see the fake liberals say we've got to agree
[14:06.360 --> 14:11.520]  with what they say or we're not liberals that's not liberal that's
[14:11.520 --> 14:21.800]  totalitarian that's oppressive that's despotic by every yardstick so I just
[14:21.800 --> 14:27.040]  want to celebrate on Christmas Eve here with all of you 20 years of the info
[14:27.040 --> 14:35.480]  war and the fact that I have been able with the grace of God and your support
[14:35.480 --> 14:40.000]  out there to go find grassroots reporters with no some of them had
[14:40.000 --> 14:42.360]  professional backgrounds like Darren McBreen and others some of them have
[14:42.360 --> 14:47.560]  degrees like Leanne McAdoo in in journalism from UT but she'd been
[14:47.560 --> 14:51.280]  successful already just doing entertainment television because there
[14:51.280 --> 14:54.680]  isn't a lot of places for journalism these days in the establishment system
[14:54.680 --> 14:59.920]  but a lot of my reporters just entered contest did a great job and I hired them
[14:59.920 --> 15:04.440]  and they've developed and are getting better and better it is a let me skip
[15:04.440 --> 15:10.720]  this network break coming up it is a testament to humanity that all of us
[15:10.720 --> 15:16.200]  over time can develop I was listening to that song exercising this morning by
[15:16.200 --> 15:22.720]  Eric Smith dream on I think the title everybody knows the song but you've
[15:22.720 --> 15:30.320]  got to lose to learn how to win and that's why the nanny state doesn't want
[15:30.320 --> 15:34.400]  you playing dodgeball doesn't want you ever get in a fist fight don't want you
[15:34.400 --> 15:38.800]  ever falling off the roof doesn't want you ever doing anything because they
[15:38.800 --> 15:45.680]  know the adversity will develop you and battle test you and make you stronger
[15:45.680 --> 15:50.120]  like I knew Joe Biggs would be a great reporter because the tenacity he had to
[15:50.120 --> 15:56.840]  expose the murder of his friend Mr. Hastings and now he just gets better
[15:56.840 --> 16:01.760]  and better and he's only been here six eight months that's what I'm talking
[16:01.760 --> 16:04.960]  about so today before I get into all this news I want to just talk about the
[16:04.960 --> 16:09.840]  fact that all of us can be journalist all of us can post YouTube videos all of
[16:09.840 --> 16:14.720]  us can write blogs about what we see and what we think and it all has value in
[16:14.720 --> 16:19.280]  the end because it's just more people giving what they really believe
[16:19.280 --> 16:25.800]  perspective and that ambient background of truth will topple two plus two equals
[16:25.800 --> 16:29.760]  five you didn't build your business raising the debt ceiling doesn't raise
[16:29.760 --> 16:36.200]  the debt ceiling your children aren't your children we're not coming after your
[16:36.200 --> 16:41.280]  guns just turn them in don't run we are your friends
[16:44.600 --> 16:50.520]  we will overthrow the fraudulent paradigm the minute we start saying no the
[16:50.520 --> 16:54.240]  minute we start disagreeing and saying you don't speak for me the minute we
[16:54.240 --> 16:58.560]  start voting with our dollars to promote high quality products made to
[16:58.560 --> 17:03.720]  America organic the minute we start supporting true independent media that
[17:03.720 --> 17:06.720]  stands up for freedom and that doesn't mean you even got to agree with
[17:06.720 --> 17:11.120]  everything a media outlet puts out but if they consistently will break real
[17:11.120 --> 17:16.680]  news tell the truth stick their neck out and tell it like it is they deserve
[17:16.680 --> 17:23.360]  support McClatchy puts out kind of a socialist drivel I sing on a lot of what
[17:23.360 --> 17:28.120]  they do but I respect them as a news agency out of Florida because they'll
[17:28.120 --> 17:32.960]  expose banks dealing drugs and banks running the aircraft and the CIA dealing
[17:32.960 --> 17:39.360]  drugs and torture squads and Obama's Obamacare really being a banker bailout
[17:39.360 --> 17:44.160]  they'll expose Obama being behind much of the banker bailout and getting it
[17:44.160 --> 17:49.840]  passed in the Senate so as bad as McClatchy is in their overall world
[17:49.840 --> 17:57.800]  view they have enough integrity to not be like CNN or MSNBC that just vomit
[17:57.800 --> 18:05.800]  twisted disinformation 24-7 and occasionally CNN will tell the truth
[18:05.800 --> 18:08.960]  about police departments around the country running you know illegal
[18:08.960 --> 18:13.560]  checkpoints and asset formative seizure but they only did that to change state
[18:13.560 --> 18:17.120]  laws where you can't have asset formative seizure so the feds could pass a
[18:17.120 --> 18:20.960]  law where the police could become federalized and still get their money
[18:20.960 --> 18:24.960]  so see you've also got to realize when the mainstream media does tell the truth
[18:24.960 --> 18:31.080]  there's usually an ulterior motive to it like yeah there's a lot of police
[18:31.080 --> 18:35.960]  brutality and out of control bullies and in the uniform in some areas a lot of
[18:35.960 --> 18:38.600]  departments are trying to weed them out some departments want to become pure
[18:38.600 --> 18:42.120]  bully it kind of goes one way or the other there isn't a middle ground as the
[18:42.120 --> 18:48.120]  Bible says lukewarm that don't exist it's either bad or it's good generally in
[18:48.120 --> 18:56.640]  that spectrum but they're only telling you about that so the feds can come in
[18:56.640 --> 19:00.720]  that have been globalized and occupy this country that's the only reason
[19:00.720 --> 19:04.920]  they're stirring all this up and the American people instinctively get that
[19:04.920 --> 19:10.800]  that's why they have an ABC news article after NYC deaths a surge of support for
[19:10.800 --> 19:17.840]  police how about a surge of support for good police let's see it becomes an us
[19:17.840 --> 19:21.440]  against them either you totally back the cops or you don't back them the thin
[19:21.440 --> 19:25.360]  blue line that's mindless and that creates corruption I don't support
[19:25.360 --> 19:30.560]  mindless support now that said I want to get to Paul Watson's report here in a
[19:30.560 --> 19:34.480]  moment we're skipping this network break so station shouldn't be going over it
[19:34.480 --> 19:38.680]  our wonderful affiliates you support as well during Christmas and the holiday
[19:38.680 --> 19:42.400]  season by spreading the word and supporting their local sponsors that is
[19:42.400 --> 19:50.200]  so integral and so important but before we go any further let me tell you what
[19:50.200 --> 19:53.320]  else is coming up
[19:54.400 --> 19:58.800]  millions of Christians are in mourning this Christmas war on Christians
[19:58.800 --> 20:03.560]  intensifies Ron Paul Institute ISIS is turning Christian churches into torture
[20:03.560 --> 20:07.760]  chambers where it forces believers to convert to Islam and funding its terror
[20:07.760 --> 20:13.600]  mission by selling stripped artifacts to Western collectors as well as selling
[20:13.600 --> 20:18.560]  women into sex slavery daily mail what a great group of people the Saudi Arabian
[20:18.560 --> 20:26.960]  Wahhabist are we've also got another shooting this time of an armed black
[20:26.960 --> 20:32.480]  team in the St. Louis area so riots kick off again in Ferguson video of that's
[20:32.480 --> 20:38.560]  up on info wars.com cyber command investment ensures hackers targeting
[20:38.560 --> 20:43.200]  us face retribution see oh they're launching attacks and shut down North
[20:43.200 --> 20:47.920]  Korea now because they did the hack attack the FBI said so actually FBI
[20:47.920 --> 20:52.240]  didn't say so they had one release from the Justice Department saying the FBI
[20:52.240 --> 20:59.240]  thought some of it could have led back to North Korea but now Sony and the FBI
[20:59.240 --> 21:04.960]  admit it was an inside job that's now breaking and let's go over that right
[21:04.960 --> 21:13.440]  now remember our article last Friday NSA capable of false Sony hack blamed on
[21:13.440 --> 21:17.960]  North Korea NSA hackers can easily frame another country and that's the data
[21:17.960 --> 21:21.880]  that was given to the FBI you can go into somebody's computer remotely and
[21:21.880 --> 21:25.760]  then run basically a zombie attack through their computer we've been attacked
[21:25.760 --> 21:29.920]  many times and then we track back to computers and it's thousands of private
[21:29.920 --> 21:34.840]  computers from Japan to Australia to Europe to the United States that are
[21:34.840 --> 21:41.040]  attacking info wars.com and prison planet.com but you heard Paul Watson on
[21:41.040 --> 21:45.440]  the show and myself say over and over again most of the smart money is pointed
[21:45.440 --> 21:51.040]  to inside job at Sony probably by executives on purpose but you got to put
[21:51.040 --> 21:57.360]  some meat in there a few you know dirt dishings on some of the Hollywood stars
[21:57.360 --> 22:01.920]  to make folks bite the hook's got to have a little bit of worm on it well
[22:01.920 --> 22:07.120]  here is CBS news was FBI wrong on North Korea
[22:07.120 --> 22:10.320]  cybersecurity experts are questioning the FBI's claim that North Korea is
[22:10.320 --> 22:14.760]  responsible for the hack the crippled Sony pitchers a senior vice president
[22:14.760 --> 22:19.200]  with cybersecurity firm Norse told CBS News his company has data that doubts the
[22:19.200 --> 22:23.960]  FBI findings Sony was not just hacked this is a company that was essentially
[22:23.960 --> 22:30.040]  nuked from the inside and then here's another headline breaking we can
[22:30.040 --> 22:39.200]  conclusively confirm North Korea was not behind hashtag Sony hack that's out of
[22:39.200 --> 22:44.560]  got news so this is all coming out well folks Paul Watson has an article from
[22:44.560 --> 22:49.120]  days ago where the original FBI agents said it appeared to be an inside job
[22:49.120 --> 22:53.520]  so that's me there's like two FBI's you got the FBI that did its job looked at
[22:53.520 --> 22:57.320]  it said looks like it happened from the inside that gets shut down the
[22:57.320 --> 23:02.760]  politicos over at Obama land they get ahold of it let's play this clip first
[23:02.760 --> 23:07.000]  of Obama today in a press conference saying we can't have a dictator telling
[23:07.000 --> 23:12.480]  us what to do buddy you have become a dictator on guns on borders on energy
[23:12.480 --> 23:16.920]  issues on the military with executive orders like no other president in
[23:16.920 --> 23:23.720]  history Jonathan Turley big liberal professor constitutional law scholar
[23:23.720 --> 23:27.720]  says you're three times worse than Bush I don't agree with that you're five times
[23:27.720 --> 23:35.680]  worse and Bush was outrageously unconstitutional worst ever when it came
[23:35.680 --> 23:39.680]  is just all out executive power unitary executive Cheney claiming that the
[23:39.680 --> 23:42.840]  vice president was above the law and doing every wanted and bigger than the
[23:42.840 --> 23:46.880]  problem is just crazy talk they could have secretly arrest citizens and they
[23:46.880 --> 23:53.360]  wanted to Obama then codified it into law under the NDAA 2011 so here is
[23:53.360 --> 23:58.160]  Obama in his press conference saying Sony did the right thing talk about hype
[23:58.160 --> 24:02.480]  he's so he doesn't even matter no one's even listening to him now so he's a
[24:02.480 --> 24:06.760]  champion of free speech we can't let a dictator tell us what to do when North
[24:06.760 --> 24:11.440]  Korea came out of six days ago and said they didn't do it but that they would
[24:11.440 --> 24:14.680]  blow us up any minute I mean again I must say North Korea is good they're
[24:14.680 --> 24:19.240]  horrible the point is this is all a way to bring in the expansion of cyber
[24:19.240 --> 24:26.920]  security here's Obama we cannot have a society in which some dictator some
[24:26.920 --> 24:37.240]  place can start imposing censorship here in the United States because if somebody
[24:37.240 --> 24:43.720]  is able to intimidate folks out of releasing a satirical movie imagine
[24:43.720 --> 24:48.480]  what they start doing when they see a documentary that they don't like or news
[24:48.480 --> 24:53.840]  reports that they don't like let's stop right there and again I saw it this
[24:53.840 --> 24:58.400]  morning it was a press conference at two o'clock Eastern yesterday and the day
[24:58.400 --> 25:02.440]  before he said Sony did the wrong thing this is all scripted wag the dog just
[25:02.440 --> 25:05.320]  like the fake bin Laden raid I'm gonna play watch this report in the next
[25:05.320 --> 25:12.080]  segment this is all totally scripted and again it's not arrogance when I say we
[25:12.080 --> 25:15.960]  told you first it was probably an inside job but not even by a disgruntled
[25:15.960 --> 25:20.440]  employee there's always stuff getting leaked at Sony or any other big outfit
[25:20.440 --> 25:24.240]  from insiders that get disgruntled they'll probably dig up some low level
[25:24.240 --> 25:30.040]  person that leaked something frame them for everything else you can believe it
[25:30.040 --> 25:34.440]  this whole thing was scripted Sony goes along this is basically the Japanese
[25:34.440 --> 25:38.720]  government on Sony through one of its major mafias that's come out on record
[25:38.720 --> 25:43.600]  it's like five families run Japan one of the biggest on Sony on record so Japan
[25:43.600 --> 25:46.480]  does whatever it's told by the globalist remember it got occupied all their
[25:46.480 --> 25:53.880]  elites got let off for war crimes in 1945 the imper got let off for running the
[25:53.880 --> 25:58.560]  biological weapons program all of it they do what the new world order says the
[25:58.560 --> 26:04.320]  joke is Sony stands for standard oil New York but kind of does but really stands
[26:04.320 --> 26:11.440]  for Japanese mafia and they do hate North Korea North Korea hates them North
[26:11.440 --> 26:15.240]  Korea has been firing nuke missiles without the nukes on top you know at
[26:15.240 --> 26:20.200]  at Japan over their coast and in all sorts of menacing Japan's in deep
[26:20.200 --> 26:25.480]  economic and trouble is militarizing right now secretly has developed nuclear
[26:25.480 --> 26:30.120]  weapons that's come out you heard it here first but the point is that's all
[26:30.120 --> 26:34.520]  happening and so they're gearing up for war with China and war with North
[26:34.520 --> 26:39.920]  Korea they want to put the movie out but bigger than a $200 million movie they
[26:39.920 --> 26:44.360]  want the propaganda to demonize North Korea and to stir North Korea up as a
[26:44.360 --> 26:49.960]  shy op that's what they get out of it then domestically they get to try to pass
[26:49.960 --> 26:53.600]  more cybersecurity they have to legitimize the war making capability of
[26:53.600 --> 26:59.080]  cybersecurity get to Hollywood eyes it Sony and others are pushing to get more
[26:59.080 --> 27:03.920]  pirating laws passed sopa and syspa to restrict everybody worldwide not just in
[27:03.920 --> 27:07.320]  the u.s. is one of them's international treaty to restrict our free speech you've
[27:07.320 --> 27:10.920]  got the Asian Pacific Partnership that which he leaks released one of the
[27:10.920 --> 27:14.880]  sections of that basically ends internet freedom and brings us into Chinese style
[27:14.880 --> 27:19.560]  net censorship we've got Zuckerberg who says his users are done efforts at
[27:19.560 --> 27:23.360]  Facebook meeting with the head of Chinese censorship two weeks ago and saying
[27:23.360 --> 27:29.480]  he now supports socialism notice communism is now socialism we don't
[27:29.480 --> 27:32.920]  have communism we have socialism it's always billionaires supporting it because
[27:32.920 --> 27:37.760]  their tax exempt offshore this is all happening and now they're coming out
[27:37.760 --> 27:41.200]  and going you know what originally we're gonna show you this article coming up
[27:41.200 --> 27:49.360]  the FBI said this was an inside job two weeks ago they came in they looked at it
[27:49.360 --> 27:54.320]  it was so widespread it was across the board it was on secure networks blocked
[27:54.320 --> 27:57.840]  with internal firewalls and they said this looks like an inside job but that
[27:57.840 --> 28:02.560]  was only in a couple articles CBS and ABC and Paul Watson and his piece shows
[28:02.560 --> 28:06.960]  those it's up on drudgerport.com we'll repost this article from yesterday back
[28:06.960 --> 28:17.200]  to info wars.com and there it is ladies and gentlemen in everybody's face the
[28:17.200 --> 28:21.280]  marketing scam and it gets Obama back in the headlines suddenly supporting free
[28:21.280 --> 28:25.320]  speech we're gonna have a heyday with that because it was the Obama
[28:25.320 --> 28:33.760]  administration that arrested the maker of the anti-Mohammed film and blame that
[28:33.760 --> 28:37.440]  on Benghazi when it had nothing to do with it this is the group trying to
[28:37.440 --> 28:41.500]  censor the web the internet and talk radio this is the group sickening the
[28:41.500 --> 28:46.000]  IRS on alternative media conservative media libertarian think tanks
[28:46.000 --> 28:50.240]  conservative think tanks veterans groups pro-life groups Christian groups
[28:50.240 --> 28:54.360]  evangelical groups they've got the Pentagon telling you know in manuals at
[28:54.360 --> 29:01.320]  Fort Hood indicted to Nesta Suza and died all these other filmmakers but we can't
[29:01.320 --> 29:04.880]  have dictators telling us what to do when there's an it was confirmed in
[29:04.880 --> 29:09.760]  congressional documents yesterday that indeed the IRS had memos saying we're
[29:09.760 --> 29:13.240]  gonna go after icky conservatives I love how that so they don't feel bad about
[29:13.240 --> 29:17.280]  ruining lives arresting people taking their bank accounts outside of law they
[29:17.280 --> 29:23.080]  call it icky this person I'm gonna abuse an assault is icky they even use
[29:23.080 --> 29:28.720]  non-threatening words when they crush people maybe if Nazis wore pink outfits
[29:28.720 --> 29:33.280]  and shot Jews in the head and called it icky it'd be okay if they had like you
[29:33.280 --> 29:38.400]  know lisp in their voice with an MPR voice hi this is all Nazis considered
[29:38.400 --> 29:42.200]  I'm gonna talk in a real soft voice and wear a pink uniform when I beat your

[34:41.880 --> 34:49.960]  reset here and calmly yet again point out that we said it was probably Sony
[34:49.960 --> 34:54.600]  working with the Democratic Party has a huge stunt so Obama could look like an
[34:54.600 --> 34:59.400]  anti-totalitarian and bash North Korea which is a good target to bash it's so
[34:59.400 --> 35:03.800]  horrible it makes him look good I'll just say it North Korea is his wish list is
[35:03.800 --> 35:10.160]  his dream Kim Jong-un has red carpets has large jumbo jets everyone else
[35:10.160 --> 35:16.120]  doesn't have air conditioning or food Obama goes to Africa and he says you
[35:16.120 --> 35:21.040]  can't have air conditioning or a car I just landed in a jumbo jet with red
[35:21.040 --> 35:25.880]  carpets and 500 security people costing hundreds of millions each visit that's
[35:25.880 --> 35:32.360]  okay I'm gonna charge you for carbon taxes make myself exempt and then live
[35:32.360 --> 35:39.880]  in palaces that's okay so see he'd love when Obama grows up he wants to be like
[35:39.880 --> 35:46.840]  Kim Jong-un a nobody who didn't do anything for his power who soft ugly
[35:46.840 --> 35:54.400]  pathetic scum-ridden anti-human maggot of hell the opposite of what I want to
[35:54.400 --> 36:03.640]  be the opposite of George Washington the opposite of Lewis and Clark the
[36:03.640 --> 36:12.320]  opposite of all the great minds a joke an abomination the opposite of being
[36:12.320 --> 36:16.000]  strong and free
[36:18.320 --> 36:26.320]  groveling a business Rodman that's just perfect that's absolutely picture
[36:26.320 --> 36:32.760]  perfect a picture tells a thousand words doesn't it ready to describe that so
[36:32.760 --> 36:39.320]  addled in tyranny unable so narcissistic so worshipful at the tree of
[36:39.320 --> 36:43.800]  celebrity that through the distorted lens that that little maggot looks through
[36:43.800 --> 36:49.200]  when he was living in an armored palace at private school in Switzerland on the
[36:49.200 --> 36:58.680]  blood of his people never even living in North Korea after the age of 10 that he
[36:58.680 --> 37:07.600]  would think Dennis Rodman a washed-up joke for more than a decade was a god
[37:13.600 --> 37:20.920]  it's incredible truth is stranger than fiction and now breaking we can
[37:20.920 --> 37:31.360]  conclusively confirm North Korea was not behind Sony attack and they go over
[37:31.360 --> 37:36.480]  what the top security firms have looked at CBS News is also reporting it 200
[37:36.480 --> 37:42.480]  gigabytes of data on November 21st was transferred out and they go over all of
[37:42.480 --> 37:52.760]  the breakdown and it's not what they thought we'll break that down after Paul
[37:52.760 --> 37:57.600]  Watson's report it because look it's bigger than this movie or Obama saying
[37:57.600 --> 38:00.800]  he's not a dictator to make himself look good comparing himself to Kim Jong-un
[38:00.800 --> 38:04.080]  and standing up for free speech when he's really wedging a war against it
[38:04.080 --> 38:10.520]  it's taking this story and just seeing how they run these hoaxes because the
[38:10.520 --> 38:15.920]  only power mainstream dinosaur media has on its last leg is total concerted
[38:15.920 --> 38:20.760]  hype with a major corporation and the White House all doing everything they
[38:20.760 --> 38:25.520]  can to hype something and still then a week and a half it unravels and is
[38:25.520 --> 38:35.320]  falling on its face as a giant stinking fraud to pass unlimited power in the
[38:35.320 --> 38:41.400]  new Congress they've reintroduced CISPA they've introduced the treaties for
[38:41.400 --> 38:46.400]  CISPA and SOPA at the UN level as well to end internet freedom using this hack
[38:46.400 --> 38:53.560]  as the excuse thinking you're so stupid cyber command investment ensures
[38:53.560 --> 38:58.040]  hackers targeting us face retribution Pentagon budget documents to tell
[38:58.040 --> 39:02.160]  growing military commitment to cyber warfare and you notice they shut down
[39:02.160 --> 39:06.480]  North Korea's internet for now three days running off and on well that's not
[39:06.480 --> 39:12.520]  hard they barely got electricity but in two cities they're still on dial-up
[39:12.520 --> 39:20.160]  like saying the Pentagon put its boot on a dead squirrel's neck in the park
[39:21.120 --> 39:25.280]  let's go ahead and go to Paul Watson's report that's on info wars.com
[39:25.280 --> 39:33.040]  prisonplanet.com middle column of drudgereport.com has this been one huge cynical marketing
[39:33.040 --> 39:39.200]  campaign from the very beginning with news that Sony may now be planning to
[39:39.200 --> 39:44.680]  show the interview on Christmas Day after all sources familiar with the
[39:44.680 --> 39:49.200]  situation tell the Dallas Morning News that Sony executives are discussing the
[39:49.200 --> 39:53.240]  likelihood of a Thursday release during a conference call it was scheduled to
[39:53.240 --> 39:59.280]  begin at 10 this morning Dallas time the Alamo Draft House has also announced
[39:59.280 --> 40:04.080]  that it will screen the film if it becomes available and Atlanta's Plaza
[40:04.080 --> 40:08.480]  Theatre has also announced that plans to show the controversial movie on
[40:08.480 --> 40:16.000]  Christmas Day so is the marketing campaign now complete because remember
[40:16.000 --> 40:20.600]  the Guardians of Peace the hacking group behind the breach of Sony in their
[40:20.600 --> 40:27.080]  original message did not mention North Korea or the movie the interview in
[40:27.080 --> 40:32.920]  their initial threat this whole hacking scandal only became about the interview
[40:32.920 --> 40:39.440]  and North Korea as a result of the media narrative that was massaged by Sony in
[40:39.440 --> 40:45.320]  the weeks that followed the initial hack the initial investigation of the hack
[40:45.320 --> 40:52.880]  strongly suggested to the FBI that it was an inside job carried out by a Sony
[40:52.880 --> 40:59.160]  employee who had to have had intricate knowledge of Sony's security and email
[40:59.160 --> 41:04.520]  system there was no hard evidence to suggest that North Korea was behind the
[41:04.520 --> 41:10.160]  attack yet this narrative was created that the North Koreans had been behind
[41:10.160 --> 41:17.240]  the breach as a result of them being offended at the fact that Kim Jong-un was
[41:17.240 --> 41:22.640]  assassinated in the movie the interview and to bolster the narrative that North
[41:22.640 --> 41:27.680]  Korea was behind the hack and that the United States was responding North
[41:27.680 --> 41:34.960]  Korea's internet went down yesterday and it's just gone down again today so the
[41:34.960 --> 41:41.400]  question is was this planned all along is this the ultimate cynical marketing
[41:41.400 --> 41:48.080]  campaign with Sony reversing its decision to show the interview of course
[41:48.080 --> 41:53.400]  they've built up all this anticipation amongst the general public to see this
[41:53.400 --> 41:59.440]  film initially denying them the chance to see it now it appears as though it
[41:59.440 --> 42:06.040]  could be rolled out on Christmas day so if that happens this movie is obviously
[42:06.040 --> 42:12.160]  going to gross far more than it would have done so otherwise so even if you
[42:12.160 --> 42:16.800]  believe that the initial Sony hack was carried out by an outside party and was
[42:16.800 --> 42:22.240]  not an inside job which is what a lot of evidence suggests could they have
[42:22.240 --> 42:28.240]  attempted to recoup some of the cost of that hack by strong arming this movie
[42:28.240 --> 42:33.400]  into the narrative by making it all about North Korea and the interview so as
[42:33.400 --> 42:37.640]  to provide this build-up of anticipation to see this movie which is now
[42:37.640 --> 42:43.280]  released which will now gross many millions more than it would have done
[42:43.280 --> 42:48.520]  so otherwise and of course Sony could not have carried off this North Korea
[42:48.520 --> 42:53.760]  narrative without the White House's help you know labeling this the most
[42:53.760 --> 43:00.760]  unprecedented cyber attack in history with Obama in his speech on Friday
[43:00.760 --> 43:07.240]  vowing to respond now we've got North Korean internet going down twice and of
[43:07.240 --> 43:13.200]  course this has reinvigorated support for Sysper and Sopa two bills that were
[43:13.200 --> 43:18.200]  completely dead it was zombie legislation going nowhere now those
[43:18.200 --> 43:22.960]  privacy busting bills are going to be reintroduced and voted on as soon as
[43:22.960 --> 43:29.320]  next month the resurrected version of Sysper is going to grease the skids for
[43:29.320 --> 43:35.600]  more internet regulation and the resurrected version of Sopa the stop
[43:35.600 --> 43:42.680]  online piracy act if passed is going to make life a hell of a lot easier for
[43:42.680 --> 43:49.720]  Sony and those other movie studios to crack down on copyright infringement so
[43:49.720 --> 43:54.600]  we see both a financial motive in building up the anticipation behind
[43:54.600 --> 44:01.400]  the interview we also see a political motive in greasing the skids for Sopa
[44:01.400 --> 44:06.800]  which was completely dead now is going to be reintroduced it looks like as soon
[44:06.800 --> 44:12.320]  as next month so you go across the board and you see that the only people to
[44:12.320 --> 44:18.200]  benefit from this hack in the long run is not North Korea is not Kim Jong-un is
[44:18.200 --> 44:28.120]  not any nebulous hacker group it's the u.s. government and Sony so then you ask
[44:28.120 --> 44:34.680]  the question who's likely to have been behind the attack I wonder let me know
[44:34.680 --> 44:38.560]  what you think in the comments below this is Paul Joseph Watson reporting for
[44:38.560 --> 44:41.840]  info wars.com
[44:41.840 --> 44:47.800]  super job they call us conspiracy theorist we just know how the system
[44:47.800 --> 44:53.240]  works and now here's the Hollywood reporter with the headline Sony hack
[44:53.240 --> 45:00.880]  studio security points to inside job what we say a week and a half ago Fox news
[45:00.880 --> 45:07.200]  Fox suspicion mounting Sony hack was inside job boy I've gotten criticized
[45:07.200 --> 45:13.760]  for using that term now it's a modern colloquialism that everybody's using it's
[45:13.760 --> 45:20.640]  in the nomenclature US retaliation for Sony hack should not leave fingerprints
[45:20.640 --> 45:27.320]  but it did it's a frame up the FBI originally told the truth and said they
[45:27.320 --> 45:32.960]  thought it was an inside job Obama took it over made it political and had a higher
[45:32.960 --> 45:37.760]  ffpi group put out a report saying that it was linked to North Korea it's
[45:37.760 --> 45:41.680]  actually linked to Japan and a lot of the hacks that are done even when they
[45:41.680 --> 45:46.400]  come out of the US bounces off Japan or Australia that's I'm not a hacker but
[45:46.400 --> 45:51.040]  this is what I've been told by top people that's how they hide it but the top
[45:51.040 --> 45:55.760]  groups that have been analyzing this they're quoted in CBS news top security
[45:55.760 --> 46:07.280]  firms say it leads to Japan variety says how Obama took Sony's crisis from bad
[46:07.280 --> 46:12.080]  to worse yeah he jumped into the middle of it saying hey don't let people violate
[46:12.080 --> 46:16.520]  our first amendment some dictator and then when Sony came back and said okay
[46:16.520 --> 46:22.600]  we'll air it part of the marketing scam that's pretty evident now I'd say 95% he
[46:22.600 --> 46:28.360]  jumps in it's just good job and no one's buying it because everyone knows
[46:28.360 --> 46:33.640]  about false flags and inside jobs does that mean everything's a false flag or
[46:33.640 --> 46:39.520]  inside job no but when you see this type of coordination and the FBI's original
[46:39.520 --> 46:46.800]  report being ignored just like 9-11 the FBI tried to stop the hijackers in
[46:46.800 --> 46:56.360]  Minnesota Illinois Arizona and Dallas the FBI in everywhere there were
[46:56.360 --> 47:00.240]  hijackers training tried to stop them and was told stand down I'll never forget
[47:00.240 --> 47:06.680]  the headline it was New York Daily News but FBI agents were sure Al Qaeda had
[47:06.680 --> 47:14.480]  moles in FBI above them exactly but how about the globalist had moles who then
[47:14.480 --> 47:18.760]  run Al Qaeda just like our government runs ISIS criminal elements of it right
[47:18.760 --> 47:24.200]  now see the media would always try to be one-dimensional and go Alex Jones says
[47:24.200 --> 47:29.240]  the New York police blew up the World Trade Center's no I didn't say that or
[47:29.240 --> 47:34.400]  Alex Jones says Bush had a plunger and planted bombs I didn't say that criminal
[47:34.400 --> 47:40.120]  groups internationally with enough operatives inside had a stand down we
[47:40.120 --> 47:49.480]  know happened stand down happened FBI never revealed it had Al Qaeda mole who
[47:49.480 --> 47:54.640]  met bin Laden you guys found NBC report but that's not it was something like it's
[47:54.640 --> 47:59.680]  in my first film Road to Tyranny the headline is also in the Guardian similar
[47:59.680 --> 48:05.840]  headline FBI agents thought Al Qaeda had a mole in the FBI and that was because
[48:05.840 --> 48:09.880]  Al Qaeda was always one step ahead of them and knew everything they were doing
[48:09.880 --> 48:14.680]  because there were people above them protecting them that's what's going on
[48:14.680 --> 48:20.200]  here but see people say you either just support the FBI or you hate them you
[48:20.200 --> 48:24.040]  either just support the police or you hate them that's how we get into this
[48:24.040 --> 48:27.840]  divide and conquer and lose the country folks there are criminal groups
[48:27.840 --> 48:32.520]  globalist operations that have infiltrated and have got their people
[48:32.520 --> 48:40.400]  it's so accurate in a cartoon fashion a stylized fashion Captain America Winter
[48:40.400 --> 48:47.840]  Soldier where Hydra is the thousands of Nazis brought into the US after World
[48:47.840 --> 48:52.000]  War two that really happened over 30,000 of them in charge of basically
[48:52.000 --> 48:55.800]  everything and then they run their own global takeover operation through the
[48:55.800 --> 49:00.080]  US but it's not just Nazis it's worse than that Hydra came out of British
[49:00.080 --> 49:06.440]  intelligence founded the Nazis as a husk to carry out corporate operations then
[49:06.440 --> 49:10.560]  to steal the money transfer it back to Hydra operations it was even described
[49:10.560 --> 49:16.840]  by Ian Fleming of MI6 and OSS and described by Dr. Kaufman who was in MI6
[49:16.840 --> 49:21.400]  and described by Colonel Craig Roberts who had high-level connections in the
[49:21.400 --> 49:26.960]  CIA frequent guest here he's basically written things off this morning he says
[49:26.960 --> 49:34.840]  he's done he wrote the book Hydra it's called Hydra folks it's called Hydra so
[49:34.840 --> 49:39.040]  it's not that that's in Captain America so I'm now saying it's called Hydra
[49:39.040 --> 49:44.320]  that's why that they have the Hydra character not just a specter in the
[49:44.320 --> 49:49.240]  James Bond movies as it was originally Hydra and why because there's a head
[49:49.240 --> 49:53.960]  with a bunch of tentacles you never see the head tentacles come out you chop
[49:53.960 --> 50:00.240]  one off it just grows another one it's just a criminal enterprise working and
[50:00.240 --> 50:03.840]  the and the divide and conquer system that British intelligence used in the
[50:03.840 --> 50:07.240]  great game to take over much of the world has now been used to take over
[50:07.240 --> 50:11.880]  corporations countries families until the science of dividing everybody has
[50:11.880 --> 50:20.280]  been brought to such a level that they're now destroying the minds of the
[50:20.280 --> 50:25.200]  individual itself so nothing can stand against Hydra it's a disease and the
[50:25.200 --> 50:31.680]  people involved in it are the most mentally ill of them all it's just
[50:31.680 --> 50:38.280]  total evil and so it's true 30 was like 34,000 Nazis were put in charge of the
[50:38.280 --> 50:42.960]  major universities the rocketry the Air Force the army everything intelligence
[50:42.960 --> 50:48.920]  operations publishing banking everything they would be the directors of
[50:48.920 --> 50:54.360]  operations and then you'd have another director above them who was a US
[50:54.360 --> 50:58.000]  citizen but the people actually running things have been wearing black
[50:58.000 --> 51:03.480]  uniforms in Germany yes family and friends are gathering to give gifts and

[54:51.400 --> 54:55.640]  that really kind of captured the essence of that generation there's another
[54:55.640 --> 54:59.800]  analogy to be taken from Captain America and that is that that generation and
[54:59.800 --> 55:04.400]  America in general has essentially fallen asleep like Captain America did as
[55:04.400 --> 55:08.480]  you see him wake up in the second Captain America movie to find that he's
[55:08.480 --> 55:13.200]  living in an authoritarian police state for a second day in a row a group of
[55:13.200 --> 55:17.120]  World War two vets literally took down a barrier blocking off the World War two
[55:17.120 --> 55:24.480]  memorial in Washington DC well you seem pretty chipper is the one who just found
[55:24.480 --> 55:29.280]  out they died for nothing wow I go protect Iraq he's in Iraq and I come
[55:29.280 --> 55:33.320]  back and I find that my fellow Americans are being attacked by
[55:33.320 --> 55:45.400]  for once we're way ahead of the curve by holding a gun to everyone on earth and
[55:45.400 --> 55:50.480]  calling it protection the police and National Guard going street by street
[55:50.480 --> 55:56.720]  house to house instructions to disarm anyone inside gonna neutralize a lot
[55:56.720 --> 56:00.120]  of threats before they even happen out the punishment usually came after the
[56:00.120 --> 56:05.320]  crime and when they say I want my lawyer you tell them shut up your time to get
[56:05.320 --> 56:11.440]  on lawyer you're an enemy combat yes there's some nasty stuff yeah we
[56:11.440 --> 56:14.760]  compromised sometimes in ways that made us not sleep so well when I was in
[56:14.760 --> 56:17.680]  Afghanistan they usually kept us outside these buildings and the other
[56:17.680 --> 56:21.640]  government agency guys probably like DEA CIA and all that they would go under
[56:21.640 --> 56:25.680]  these kind of rooms like that exactly and they would be torturing people from
[56:25.680 --> 56:29.200]  in there horrible scream to hear a grown person like that good being tortured
[56:29.200 --> 56:33.480]  you watching as this opium is being grown we provide them security we're
[56:33.480 --> 56:36.680]  providing them resources and we're providing them alternatives Captain
[56:36.680 --> 56:41.520]  America is a fugitive from shield with all due respect if shield is conducting
[56:41.520 --> 56:44.800]  a manhunt for Captain America we deserve to know why you have a lot of people
[56:44.800 --> 56:47.800]  that are coming out of the military that have the ability and the knowledge to
[56:47.800 --> 56:52.360]  to build IEDs and to defeat law enforcement techniques this is only
[56:52.360 --> 56:56.160]  gonna get worse once it starts and again there's no veterans doing anything
[56:56.160 --> 57:01.040]  right now no IEDs they are literally getting the police to pick a fight with
[57:01.040 --> 57:08.800]  veterans you are standing in my brain how did you get here in fight of this
[57:08.800 --> 57:13.040]  operation in paperclip after a world war two she'll recruit a German scientist
[57:13.040 --> 57:18.040]  with strategic values all I could have their cause operation paperclip
[57:18.040 --> 57:22.180]  explores the secret military program that hired scientists who use slave
[57:22.180 --> 57:27.040]  labor to build the v2 rocket and others use concentration camp victims for
[57:27.040 --> 57:30.880]  human experiments the responsibility for the staggering loss of life and
[57:30.880 --> 57:35.080]  property is uniformly placed on Hitler and the Nazis but excluded from the
[57:35.080 --> 57:39.240]  official history is the fact that Hitler and the national socialists would not
[57:39.240 --> 57:44.440]  have risen to power without the help of international bankers and American and
[57:44.440 --> 57:48.800]  German corporations she's disabling security protocols and dumping all the
[57:48.800 --> 57:59.040]  secrets under the internet including hydras and shields I think the
[57:59.040 --> 58:05.240]  revelations are terrible because they were they were revealed what's his name
[58:05.240 --> 58:11.840]  Snowden yes Snowden I thank you the traitor what about the others are you
[58:11.840 --> 58:15.120]  planning a rescue mission you think about what is going on with the veterans
[58:15.120 --> 58:18.680]  administration the hospital and the fact that we have veterans that are dying
[58:18.680 --> 58:22.240]  because they're on a wait list you talk about Sergeant Tamarisi and his
[58:22.240 --> 58:33.680]  situation something that I've been upset about raising cane about so I'm gonna

[59:51.280 --> 59:56.680]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[59:56.680 --> 01:00:12.560]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:20.080]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:30.280]  Alex Jones Tony has a 79% chance of going bankrupt it's being reported but
[01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:35.960]  magically they've got this new film out they think and pull their bacon and even
[01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:41.400]  the Hollywood Reporter and others are coming out saying it looks like an
[01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:46.040]  inside job using that word and the reason I'm making such a big deal off of
[01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:50.000]  this today is it is a big deal not the story of the Hackett shelf but what they
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:55.640]  want to get out of the hack so possessive a restriction of rights and so much
[01:00:55.640 --> 01:01:03.400]  more AMC theater chain owner Wang Zhang Lin is China's richest man and that's
[01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:09.720]  part of the pressure they used to have the film Red Dawn a few years ago
[01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:15.920]  re-edited and not released for a year so that Chinese communist forces were
[01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:23.280]  removed from it now I gave you my definition of a winter soldier I guess
[01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:28.760]  we've got one here from the Urban Dictionary a person especially a member
[01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:35.080]  of a military a person especially a member of a political party or military
[01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:39.760]  organization who is hardcore who endures during hard times the opposite of a
[01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:46.080]  summer soldier or sunshine soldier a phrase used by Thomas Payne to denote and
[01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:49.840]  mock men who signed up for the Revolutionary War and then quit when the
[01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:58.120]  going got tough most of that outfit quit but the winter soldiers are still
[01:01:58.120 --> 01:02:02.720]  hanging on that's because in the winter especially back then in the north it was
[01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:08.560]  really cold in the Sun cycle at that time 20 30 below like it is in Minnesota
[01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:14.600]  now and a lot of people froze to death fact most the casualties on the way to
[01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:18.720]  Trenton and that famous victory for George Washington were people freezing
[01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:25.440]  to death on the way on their horses and you'd get there and there'd be somebody
[01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:36.560]  frozen to death dead those were winter soldiers and now we look at what men
[01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:40.600]  have been turned to and turned into in this country on average on average a lot
[01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:48.520]  of great men in this country but I just can't imagine what's going to happen
[01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:53.600]  when the economic collapse takes place you got to have an exit plan ladies and
[01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:57.640]  gentlemen we're fighting to restore the Republic we're fighting to try to fix
[01:02:57.640 --> 01:03:01.240]  things we're fighting to do the right thing we're fighting to try to stop the
[01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:08.200]  Civil War while we're demonized 24-7 by the enemy but you got to also know that
[01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:13.760]  we're gonna fight to win but you've also got to be ready just to try to survive
[01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:18.880]  the surviving in the final equation is winning and I don't mean surviving by
[01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:25.960]  going along either that's gotten us where we are but the moral rot of this
[01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:31.120]  society and I'm not on some high horse when I mean moral rot the media says
[01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:41.120]  that's drinking beer you know loving life the lover of life's not the center
[01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:45.040]  it's people that swindle the innocent it's people that dumb kids down as people
[01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:50.520]  that take advantage of folks that's true evil but you never hear that defined as
[01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:59.200]  evil or very rarely it's always having fun is evil or fighting back is evil or
[01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:03.640]  not groveling to the government is evil
[01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:10.560]  meanwhile that then gives the devil or that archetype all the fun the sexy
[01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:15.000]  cheerleader that's a devil and I'm not saying that running wild is a good thing
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:19.080]  either my point is is that all the lesser stuff is put out there as the
[01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:24.680]  ultimate sin like the Pharisees wouldn't associate with anybody even though
[01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:28.120]  they got tax money they wouldn't associate with the tax collector they
[01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:32.280]  sure wouldn't associate with a prostitute they wouldn't associate with
[01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:35.880]  somebody that butchered animals because they were too high and mighty and clean
[01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:40.680]  and Christ would have nothing to do with those people he said you're the wicked
[01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:44.120]  ones you're the people that pray out in the public you're the people that say
[01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:48.720]  how good you are all day but I see your heart and you're a devil when they

[01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:23.520]  that's that North Korea did not hack Sony it was an inside job probably a
[01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:27.000]  stunt they're now releasing the movie we said that a week and a half ago
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:31.800]  drudgereport.com is linked to Paul Watson special report on the subject we

[01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:40.400]  SISPA and SOPA that are free speech killing systems and to make Obama look
[01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:44.920]  like a savior claiming we don't need dictators censoring the media like you

[01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:20.480]  the former deputy director of the FBI's come out two days ago and said the
[01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:24.880]  Justice Department's helping stir up race war and a war on police that even if
[01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:30.480]  you hate some of the brazen activity of some police as I do I mean I'm a guy

[01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:41.000]  lot of cops that are great people and follow the Constitution on average the
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:45.160]  police I know are more pro-second amendment and know what's going on than
[01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:49.600]  the general public that's just a fact the globalists don't like that they want
[01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:53.040]  to play their enemy the American people off against their other enemy local
[01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:57.480]  government and where's the rubber meet the road in local government but the
[01:10:57.480 --> 01:11:04.800]  police you want to destabilize a country destabilize the police this is so
[01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:08.920]  obvious it's so disgusting it's so transparent and all these police
[01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:12.480]  departments getting their federal funds sucking the boots of the federal
[01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:18.400]  government that's occupied by the globalist you'll turn your back on the
[01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:23.400]  New York mayor who is a globalist piece of garbage why don't you turn your back
[01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:27.920]  on Obama and the UN and the New World Order because that's what's really
[01:11:27.920 --> 01:11:33.040]  destroying this country it's a standard communist or socialist tactic to stir up
[01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:37.320]  minority groups with real or perceived problems to start destabilization
[01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:41.600]  campaigns and it's happening here George Soros did this in Ukraine just this
[01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:48.160]  year police shoot and kill armed black teen in St. Louis area police confirmed
[01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:52.240]  the incident was followed by protests clashing with police at the scene
[01:11:52.240 --> 01:12:01.600]  accompanied by the sound of loud bangs that's RT Paul Joseph Watson has a
[01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:05.480]  report riots near Ferguson after cops shoot black teen who pointed handgun
[01:12:05.480 --> 01:12:11.360]  chaos outside gas station as protesters throw fireworks at police now let's
[01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:20.000]  stop right there because we have the local video and and see this time the
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:25.000]  police within a few hours released the video why didn't they do that in the
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:28.600]  Ferguson case you know there were video cameras around there and it turned out
[01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:38.680]  that the cop was telling the truth pretty much so why then did they not just go
[01:12:38.680 --> 01:12:42.720]  ahead and release it or go ahead and just indict him and let it come out in
[01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:44.880]  court
[01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:50.600]  wow the demonstrators are getting smart the closest thing to explosives out
[01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:55.080]  there are those mortar cannons that you put in the big mortars and shoot people
[01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:58.160]  blown their arms off of those and then they're now throwing those with the
[01:12:58.160 --> 01:13:03.080]  police that's like throwing essentially a hang grenade at somebody I mean it's
[01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:06.360]  it's it's three or four times in my experience more powerful than a flash
[01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:09.600]  bang and I'm against police throwing flash bangs at nonviolent people it's a
[01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:15.920]  serious assault throwing flash bangs is is is is way over use and then throwing
[01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:20.960]  throwing mortar shells at the police is just serious I mean it's attempted
[01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:26.280]  murder is what it is I mean this is all just the globalist plan is off against
[01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:29.840]  each other and people are sharing this on YouTube you know attack the police
[01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:37.680]  yay get them get them look at that those are mortar shells okay let's let's go to
[01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:42.120]  the next video surveillance footage of incident has been released with and
[01:13:42.120 --> 01:13:45.920]  appears to show Antonio Martin the new guy shot and killed pointing a gun at the
[01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:51.640]  officer before he was shot and the word is and go shoot police that's how you
[01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:57.400]  get justice so we're showing what happened right before this unfolds and
[01:13:57.400 --> 01:14:03.880]  on the video he appears to pull a gun out I mean is it suicide by cop we'll see
[01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:11.160]  they're segueing from that now to suicide after killing cops and I tell
[01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:14.800]  you I would not want to be citizens in these areas and I would want to be the
[01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:17.760]  police in these areas and this is only the beginning wait till the real civil war
[01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:21.480]  kicks off as I've said for years you do not want to be a police officer then
[01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:31.240]  this is so obvious and I'm getting attacked for not supporting attacking
[01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:35.720]  police and I'm getting attacked for criticizing the police this is all part
[01:14:35.720 --> 01:14:42.040]  of mindless tribalism we're supposed to join one group of the other I'm gonna
[01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:47.240]  join common sense and judgment I'm gonna join looking in each case as it comes
[01:14:47.240 --> 01:14:51.640]  and getting the best info I can before I quote support one side of the other I
[01:14:51.640 --> 01:14:56.280]  know this the globalists are trying to start a civil war I predicted it it's
[01:14:56.280 --> 01:14:59.600]  happening we should be listened to because we know what we're talking
[01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:05.240]  about and we should get the word out to stop this and the way you stop it is by
[01:15:05.240 --> 01:15:09.120]  realizing that Al Sharpton MSNBC and the Justice Department just like they
[01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:13.040]  stage fast and furious to destabilize the Southwest in Mexico to blame the
[01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:17.720]  Second Amendment are now running a false flag to start a war with local
[01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:22.840]  government with the police on the receiving end and you know I love all
[01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:27.040]  these violence talkers who say go kill police who they themselves won't do it
[01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:31.320]  they want to find some mentally ill person who'll do it for him who kills
[01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:36.240]  his girlfriend in cold blood up in New York throws a fit and then decides to go
[01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:40.280]  out as a hero because the media and the Justice Department put out the narrative
[01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:45.800]  close quote so he goes out shoots two people in cold blood who it turns out
[01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:52.880]  had good records this is disgusting I mean if a cop got caught killing some
[01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:57.560]  five-year-old kid on video and was no build and their daddy went after him
[01:15:57.560 --> 01:16:03.640]  later I'd say well that's justice this is not justice there is a time to kill
[01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:09.880]  ripping off the term from the famous novel was turned into a movie but I'll
[01:16:09.880 --> 01:16:14.200]  tell you right now I will not be played into these mindless type of operations
[01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:18.400]  now the mayor of Berkeley not Berkeley California but Berkeley Missouri this is
[01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:22.480]  right outside Ferguson two miles away has come out with a statement I know we
[01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:27.960]  were downloading it we have it good we'll get it and play it but I want to
[01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:32.240]  get your take as listeners on this how much more obvious does it have to get
[01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:39.760]  where we're told that this is the number one story of 2014 it is not the
[01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:42.800]  number one story it's the number one story the media has hyped we've been
[01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:46.360]  forced to cover it almost every day in the last six months because it was so
[01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:53.200]  obvious even before Brown got killed even before Wilson shot him even before
[01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:57.080]  any of this unfolded we were saying this is the next step this is what Obama
[01:16:57.080 --> 01:17:03.840]  will do because any fool could see what was being put up on the talking heads to
[01:17:03.840 --> 01:17:09.040]  prime the pump and get all this ready here is the mayor of the small town
[01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:14.600]  near Ferguson where it's now exploding again I had the opportunity last evening
[01:17:14.600 --> 01:17:21.320]  Berkeley Missouri to review the video nor Hoskins incident and what I saw in
[01:17:21.320 --> 01:17:29.360]  the in this incident it's not what people portray this is not a policeman in
[01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:35.880]  the city of Berkeley half cocked one out and as we say you know black lives
[01:17:35.880 --> 01:17:42.880]  matter this was not the case this is you couldn't even compare this with
[01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:49.160]  Ferguson or the gardener case in New York the gardener case in New York they
[01:17:49.160 --> 01:17:59.680]  had the video Ferguson agent not we have the video and I can assure you that
[01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:05.400]  what's on the video is what we're going to use the city of Berkeley will do be
[01:18:05.400 --> 01:18:09.680]  doing the investigation along with the same list in parallel with the same list
[01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:19.520]  counties and our overall goal is to project the truth to the residents we
[01:18:19.520 --> 01:18:27.840]  reviewed the video and it appears that that that that there was a gun pointed
[01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:32.320]  at the officer before the officer for our but we got to complete our
[01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:36.200]  investigation all right now they release a video I liked that mayor by the way
[01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:41.960]  what's different here there's a video but also he's black and that town's over
[01:18:41.960 --> 01:18:46.600]  seventy five percent black Berkeley you look at the demographics and you got
[01:18:46.600 --> 01:18:51.920]  black leadership right next door you got Ferguson that's got some black folks on
[01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:55.720]  the government but what there's that I think out of fifty something cops three
[01:18:55.720 --> 01:18:59.840]  of them are black there's your problem right there is that communities really
[01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:06.320]  should be representative of who is in them in my humble opinion that's why I
[01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:10.600]  don't like the UN trying to make our laws and running us the globalist enough
[01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:18.120]  to live under what they put on us here so you've got somebody hyped up angry it
[01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:23.160]  appears pulling a gun on a cop because that's what you're supposed to do now
[01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:30.560]  according to the media yeah there it is Ferguson has 50 white officers three
[01:19:30.560 --> 01:19:37.320]  black officers you know it's not fair if a black person does something to you to
[01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:40.800]  go shoot a random black person or it's not fair of a white person does something
[01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:44.480]  wrong to you to go shoot a want random white person and believe me folks the
[01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:51.920]  average white person is not scared I mean guns everywhere I'm scared of
[01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:55.520]  destabilization and the globalist winning I'm gonna give the number out and

[01:34:21.200 --> 01:34:29.520]  wealthy donors sided with Democrats in midterms and I've had Greg Palestine
[01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:34.400]  before who's a big investigative journalist and more of a Democrat and he
[01:34:34.400 --> 01:34:38.360]  will tell you that the Koch brothers actually helped finance Clinton into
[01:34:38.360 --> 01:34:45.920]  office they just played both sides of the spectrum Democrats act like they are
[01:34:45.920 --> 01:34:48.840]  the ultimate secret thing behind anybody that doesn't want to turn their guns
[01:34:48.840 --> 01:34:52.440]  in and that I secretly get money from them I wish I did I would announce it
[01:34:52.440 --> 01:34:55.360]  I'd use the money to finance my operation wouldn't change one thing I
[01:34:55.360 --> 01:34:59.400]  said if the head of Walmart gave me a billion dollars and said do whatever you
[01:34:59.400 --> 01:35:03.200]  want I take it and announce it I've never been given any outside money and I
[01:35:03.200 --> 01:35:09.040]  wish I was sure no I'm sick of like every little nobody you know just claims
[01:35:09.040 --> 01:35:13.280]  that as a throwaway line to say oh Alex isn't good he's financed by the Koch
[01:35:13.280 --> 01:35:17.040]  brothers meanwhile I because I was accused of that so much I went and
[01:35:17.040 --> 01:35:20.600]  researched them and found out over the last 30 years they given more money the
[01:35:20.600 --> 01:35:27.200]  Democrats than Republicans look it up I mentioned that because it comes up in
[01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:32.000]  this for as often as Democrats attack the conservative billionaires Charles and
[01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:36.800]  David Koch for their heavy spending on politics it's actually liberal minded
[01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:41.320]  who shelled out the most cash in the just completed midterm elections if
[01:35:41.320 --> 01:35:44.320]  they're not liberals they want big government to pick winners and losers
[01:35:44.320 --> 01:35:48.920]  and give them the government contracts at least that is among those groups that
[01:35:48.920 --> 01:35:54.040]  must disclose what they raise and spin I'm gonna top 100 individual donors the
[01:35:54.040 --> 01:35:58.080]  political groups more than half primarily the Democrats or their allies
[01:35:58.080 --> 01:36:02.920]  among groups that funneled more than a hundred thousand each to allies the top
[01:36:02.920 --> 01:36:07.600]  of the list titled overwhelmingly towards Democrats a group favoring the GOP
[01:36:07.600 --> 01:36:15.360]  doesn't appear until the list number 14 the two biggest super PACs of 2014 sent
[01:36:15.360 --> 01:36:22.040]  a majority PAC and House majority PAC both backing Democrats and it just goes
[01:36:22.040 --> 01:36:28.800]  on yeah and all almost all the big Republican donors and the Chamber of
[01:36:28.800 --> 01:36:34.200]  Commerce nationally gave money to Democrats over Republicans or Republicans
[01:36:34.200 --> 01:36:42.760]  over tea partiers because in fact John Bowne has a report on it let me just
[01:36:42.760 --> 01:36:47.240]  air this and I'll go to your calls dealing with JP Morgan and others if you
[01:36:47.240 --> 01:36:51.280]  look at the derivatives graphs we show them derivatives are bigger than they
[01:36:51.280 --> 01:36:56.120]  were six years ago in the last big crash and they just passed in the House and
[01:36:56.120 --> 01:37:01.400]  the Senate in the spending bill a new banker bailout called the derivatives
[01:37:01.400 --> 01:37:06.800]  a protection area that allows all the derivatives to be signed on to Alex
[01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:13.040]  Jones and you oh but I'm just supposed to hate cops and go out and shoot some
[01:37:13.040 --> 01:37:18.000]  that'll really fix things that's what the Democratic Party in the White House
[01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:22.920]  wants is a race war it'll be used to bring in tyranny instead of looking at
[01:37:22.920 --> 01:37:29.160]  who's screwing everyone over seven ways to Sunday so let's go to John Bowne's
[01:37:29.160 --> 01:37:34.240]  report on the Federal Reserve head and what their policies are and then write
[01:37:34.240 --> 01:37:37.360]  to your phone calls
[01:37:37.680 --> 01:37:42.960]  this first from here last night on the nightly news seven o'clock central
[01:37:42.960 --> 01:37:49.800]  the top 1% own about 38% of the financial wealth of America
[01:37:49.800 --> 01:37:55.360]  bottom 60% back it up that's Bernie Sanders the socialist independent and
[01:37:55.360 --> 01:37:59.920]  he's what he says is true except then he says socialism's the answer that top
[01:37:59.920 --> 01:38:06.720]  one-tenth of 1% almost to a man it gives money to take my guns raise my taxes
[01:38:06.720 --> 01:38:14.920]  and get banker bail out you little Sanders is so stupid the ultra rich
[01:38:14.920 --> 01:38:18.360]  don't like middle class and new wealth they're the ones trying to extinct their
[01:38:18.360 --> 01:38:23.640]  competition low taxes makes the poorest people rich compared to other
[01:38:23.640 --> 01:38:28.400]  countries but again Sanders go back to the beginning I'm sorry let's see if I
[01:38:28.400 --> 01:38:34.400]  can play it here it is the top 1% own about 38% of the financial wealth of
[01:38:34.400 --> 01:38:42.440]  America the bottom 60% on 2.3% one family the Walton family is worth of our
[01:38:42.440 --> 01:38:47.400]  over 140 billion dollars that's more wealth than the bottom 40% of the
[01:38:47.400 --> 01:38:53.920]  American people in recent years we have seen a huge increase in the number of
[01:38:53.920 --> 01:38:58.560]  millionaires and billionaires while we continue to have the highest rate of
[01:38:58.560 --> 01:39:04.160]  childhood poverty in the industrialized world now a study which I've just
[01:39:04.160 --> 01:39:11.960]  introduced into the record by two professors from Princeton University
[01:39:11.960 --> 01:39:16.120]  professor Martin Gillins and Northwestern University professor Benjamin Page
[01:39:16.120 --> 01:39:21.160]  basically suggest that while historically we have considered our
[01:39:21.160 --> 01:39:27.040]  society to be a capitalist democracy we may now have entered into a phase where
[01:39:27.040 --> 01:39:33.840]  we are an oligarchic form of society at pause back it up 10 seconds and the
[01:39:33.840 --> 01:39:38.080]  oligarchs through the big think tanks and through the big tax-free foundations
[01:39:38.080 --> 01:39:43.240]  are financing socialism for the general public that they're exempt from that is
[01:39:43.240 --> 01:39:50.800]  making us poor Sanders do you understand that the ultra rich are the ones
[01:39:50.800 --> 01:39:56.200]  financing this takeover no no his answer is more of what's gotten us into this
[01:39:56.200 --> 01:40:00.520]  he points at the people that have done this to us and then says let's do more
[01:40:00.520 --> 01:40:03.640]  of what they're actually pushing for he doesn't tell you that it's like Warren
[01:40:03.640 --> 01:40:07.320]  Buffett financing and underwriting ABC this week it says at the end of the
[01:40:07.320 --> 01:40:10.480]  show when he on it when he underwrites it underwritten by him and he's on it
[01:40:10.480 --> 01:40:14.600]  saying my secretary pays more than I we need to pass these new laws so I pay
[01:40:14.600 --> 01:40:19.280]  more tax meanwhile he already wrote the loopholes read and pay any tax see the
[01:40:19.280 --> 01:40:23.560]  bait and switch they play let's go back because we are in an oligarchy now but
[01:40:23.560 --> 01:40:29.000]  it's an offshore oligarchy we have considered our society to be a
[01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:34.600]  capitalist democracy we may now have entered into a phase where we are an
[01:40:34.600 --> 01:40:41.160]  oligarchic form of society in your judgment given the enormous power held
[01:40:41.160 --> 01:40:46.400]  by the billionaire class and their political representatives are we still
[01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:51.840]  a capitalist democracy or have we gone over into an oligarchic form of society
[01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:56.840]  in which incredible economic and political power now rests with the
[01:40:56.840 --> 01:41:01.480]  billionaire class I don't know what to call our system or how to I prefer not
[01:41:01.480 --> 01:41:07.560]  to give labels but there's no question that we've had a trend toward growing
[01:41:07.560 --> 01:41:12.560]  inequality I think the point that's it pauses on making and they show our
[01:41:12.560 --> 01:41:17.440]  protests the Federal Reserve this is the head of the Federal Reserve talking
[01:41:17.440 --> 01:41:20.720]  about inequality and then later how she wants to fix it when they're the ones
[01:41:20.720 --> 01:41:25.520]  running the policies creating inequality it's like if you don't like Nazis you
[01:41:25.520 --> 01:41:29.800]  go to Hitler and you say you know Hitler goes man I'm real sorry about the
[01:41:29.800 --> 01:41:35.640]  Nazis we'll deal with them let's go back to yelling and others have made is
[01:41:35.640 --> 01:41:40.520]  that there comes a point where the billionaire class has so much political
[01:41:40.520 --> 01:41:45.600]  power at what point is that reversal to an underground hideaway straight out of
[01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:51.960]  a bond film 200 feet deep with walls of reinforced concrete nine feet thick the
[01:41:51.960 --> 01:41:55.920]  survival complex has 12 stories of underground apartments and luxury
[01:41:55.920 --> 01:42:02.760]  facilities each floor costing three million dollars a bad bat to think that
[01:42:02.760 --> 01:42:06.560]  the government's gonna be there to save you if oil prices were artificially
[01:42:06.560 --> 01:42:10.440]  inflated by the Fed well so was stock prices and real estate prices so all
[01:42:10.440 --> 01:42:14.440]  these bubbles are gonna burst because of the same thing which is the Fed with
[01:42:14.440 --> 01:42:19.520]  drawing the stimulus let's consider what happened during the layman brothers
[01:42:19.520 --> 01:42:25.000]  bankruptcy in 2008 that's the one that sparked the financial crisis nearly
[01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:30.560]  melted down the economy and triggered the bailout by the taxpayers the court
[01:42:30.560 --> 01:42:37.960]  proceedings took three years clearly not rapid or orderly but layman was tiny
[01:42:37.960 --> 01:42:45.720]  compared to today's biggest banks when it failed layman had 639 billion dollars
[01:42:45.720 --> 01:42:55.400]  in assets today JP Morgan has nearly 2.5 trillion in assets that's four times as
[01:42:55.400 --> 01:43:03.520]  big as layman was when it failed layman had 209 registered subsidiaries when it
[01:43:03.520 --> 01:43:09.520]  failed JP Morgan I really almost couldn't believe this when I read it JP
[01:43:09.520 --> 01:43:19.200]  Morgan today has 3391 subsidiaries that's more than 15 times the number of
[01:43:19.200 --> 01:43:26.320]  subsidiaries that and they gave if memory serves look it up 43% more to
[01:43:26.320 --> 01:43:32.720]  Barack Obama than they did to Mitt Romney you can look that up I mean you
[01:43:32.720 --> 01:43:37.920]  do you can look up banks gave basically two to one to the Democrats in that
[01:43:37.920 --> 01:43:44.680]  election and in most others so here is the creature oh I love the point
[01:43:44.680 --> 01:43:49.920]  conning everyone let's go back to it the near phone calls the areas that layman
[01:43:49.920 --> 01:43:55.520]  had when it failed it's three years to resolve layman now JP Morgan has filed
[01:43:55.520 --> 01:44:00.920]  resolution plans in each of the last three years and the Fed hasn't rejected
[01:44:00.920 --> 01:44:06.800]  any of them as not credible given our recent experience with the bankruptcy of
[01:44:06.800 --> 01:44:13.000]  layman brothers can you honestly say that JP Morgan could be resolved in a
[01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:19.360]  rapid and orderly fashion as described in its plans with no threats to the
[01:44:19.360 --> 01:44:24.480]  economy and no need for a taxpayer bailout in fact the firms have now
[01:44:24.480 --> 01:44:30.080]  submitted a third round of plans but I'm sorry chairman I've just a little bit
[01:44:30.080 --> 01:44:37.640]  confused JP Morgan submitted a round of plans in 2012 and my understanding is
[01:44:37.640 --> 01:44:42.640]  that neither the Fed nor the FDIC said that those plans were not credible it
[01:44:42.640 --> 01:44:48.720]  then submitted plans in 2013 and neither the Fed nor the FDIC said they were not
[01:44:48.720 --> 01:44:54.680]  credible and it has submitted plans in 2014 the plans are designed not just to
[01:44:54.680 --> 01:45:01.280]  be reviewed by the Fed and the FDIC but also to bring some kind of confidence
[01:45:01.280 --> 01:45:06.240]  to the marketplace and to the American taxpayer that in fact there really is a
[01:45:06.240 --> 01:45:12.080]  plan for doing something if one of these banks starts to implode you said that
[01:45:12.080 --> 01:45:17.000]  these plans run to the tens of thousands of pages all I can say is that what's
[01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:23.960]  been released to the public is 35 pages long that's about one page for every
[01:45:23.960 --> 01:45:28.600]  hundred subsidiaries that have to be dealt with I think that the plans that
[01:45:28.600 --> 01:45:33.600]  have been released by these companies have not been something that the public
[01:45:33.600 --> 01:45:36.680]  can look at and say yeah I see that they've got a plan to get through this
[01:45:36.680 --> 01:45:40.640]  and you know people are talking about how falling oil prices are going to help the
[01:45:40.640 --> 01:45:47.200]  consumer oil prices fell from $150 a barrel down to $32 a barrel in 2008 that
[01:45:47.200 --> 01:45:51.480]  helped the consumer too but it didn't stop the financial crisis it didn't stop the
[01:45:51.480 --> 01:45:55.240]  great resistance do we all work for central bankers that's what I want to
[01:45:55.240 --> 01:45:59.800]  address to our guests tonight to answer your question we are absolutely slaves
[01:45:59.800 --> 01:46:03.240]  to central banks because we'd love to be slaves of the economy but the economic
[01:46:03.240 --> 01:46:07.040]  numbers continue to do nothing but trend lower
[01:46:09.400 --> 01:46:13.160]  well there you go that's a report by John Bowne who's in there running the
[01:46:13.160 --> 01:46:17.480]  board right now well the reason I wanted to do this report and I'm glad he did is
[01:46:17.480 --> 01:46:21.440]  they they've passed another banker bailout for derivatives so that's their
[01:46:21.440 --> 01:46:25.920]  plan is to rape you for their scams internationally and to send trillions of
[01:46:25.920 --> 01:46:30.360]  dollars offshore so there you go and you can bet your bottom dollar the
[01:46:30.360 --> 01:46:33.520]  Democrats with the Republican leadership are going to vote for it they know
[01:46:33.520 --> 01:46:37.320]  Tea Party Republicans don't vote for it so they've all circled the wagons to
[01:46:37.320 --> 01:46:42.120]  kill the Tea Party and so all of you out there when you end up having your
[01:46:42.120 --> 01:46:48.160]  pension fund taken just remember you asked for it because you hated freedom
[01:46:48.160 --> 01:46:52.440]  you hated the Tea Party you hated low taxes you hated transparency you hated
[01:46:52.440 --> 01:46:57.160]  Ron Paul this is what you asked for this is what you get Steve Tim Nelson
[01:46:57.160 --> 01:47:02.000]  Lee Victor we're going to all of you you're on the air from New York Steve go
[01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:09.640]  ahead yes greetings Alex greetings brother what's on your mind calling from
[01:47:09.640 --> 01:47:13.800]  Albany Airport and you must think I'm the only passenger in there I'm actually a
[01:47:13.800 --> 01:47:21.360]  pilot and I'm waiting for a flight anyway I put on the dredge website and
[01:47:21.360 --> 01:47:26.680]  I'm seeing the first thing in big characters is not again and I'm saying
[01:47:26.680 --> 01:47:33.000]  OMG I hope dredge is not part of the mainstream media but there was a link
[01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:39.240]  and I was not surprised to see that was a Wall Street Journal headline and this
[01:47:39.240 --> 01:47:43.200]  is the way the media is perpetrating all this and I need to go no further
[01:47:43.200 --> 01:47:51.160]  perpetrating hostilities and dividing not again with a exclamation mark and you
[01:47:51.160 --> 01:47:54.320]  know I read well I mean to be fair I mean the dredge report in full wars
[01:47:54.320 --> 01:47:58.400]  whatever is a mix of government documents video clips mainstream news
[01:47:58.400 --> 01:48:02.080]  alternative news I mean everybody's saying not again that we don't want to
[01:48:02.080 --> 01:48:05.680]  do Ferguson I mean I think I don't even know the Wall Street Journal's hyping it
[01:48:05.680 --> 01:48:09.000]  it's been it's been the Justice Department and and others that have been
[01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:13.320]  hyping that it's an epidemic and that it's the cops fault certainly there's
[01:48:13.320 --> 01:48:16.800]  some bad police out there I mean I think that's who's really hyping and are you
[01:48:16.800 --> 01:48:23.040]  saying that just linking to the new event is bad no I'm saying I wish I
[01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:28.000]  dredge but that in quotes because you know not again and but I did go to the
[01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:31.800]  link and realize it wasn't dredge I'm just saying when the facts are in there
[01:48:31.800 --> 01:48:39.320]  or partial facts anyway why why have a headline like that not again why not put
[01:48:39.320 --> 01:48:45.920]  suspect I had had done and why have a headline like that it not again no I
[01:48:45.920 --> 01:48:51.840]  hear you what else is on your mind concerning Sony that was a no-brainer
[01:48:51.840 --> 01:48:59.040]  to me you and Dr. Michael Savage I think pinned it well before pretty much when
[01:48:59.040 --> 01:49:05.160]  it came out and I've been following Sony's in the market then and they've
[01:49:05.160 --> 01:49:11.280]  been losing a lot of money a lot and that was no surprise to me that's right
[01:49:11.280 --> 01:49:14.920]  they're tanking and I guess this was some desperate stunt but I think it's
[01:49:14.920 --> 01:49:20.840]  blown up in their face because nobody buys into it yes and I didn't buy into
[01:49:20.840 --> 01:49:24.920]  it what I first heard it because I've been keeping track on it with Sony for
[01:49:24.920 --> 01:49:30.760]  about four or five years and they've they're really eight feet under and it's
[01:49:30.760 --> 01:49:38.480]  a desperate move and this is what greed is greed has no thin line well have a
[01:49:38.480 --> 01:49:44.080]  great Christmas and I guess you're flying folks around for Christmas no
[01:49:44.080 --> 01:49:49.680]  unfortunately in the industry cargo is more precious than passengers I'll give
[01:49:49.680 --> 01:49:55.320]  you the company acronym the call letters UPS so so I'll be working all right
[01:49:55.320 --> 01:49:59.120]  well be safe and have a great Christmas God bless let's talk to Tim in New
[01:49:59.120 --> 01:50:05.480]  Hampshire go ahead Tim how you doing Alex good brother first-time caller long
[01:50:05.480 --> 01:50:11.240]  time listener forever awake God bless you and your crew Merry Christmas it's my
[01:50:11.240 --> 01:50:16.360]  birthday this is a Christmas birthday present to me I got a call I'm in with a
[01:50:16.360 --> 01:50:25.320]  roosh pack and I got a call last night confirming that ex-president Bush Dick
[01:50:25.320 --> 01:50:34.200]  Cheney and President Obama were indicted on this torture deal have you heard
[01:50:34.200 --> 01:50:38.880]  anything about it the word is over in Europe there may be some EU indictments
[01:50:38.880 --> 01:50:44.320]  EU and investigations I mean Cheney thinks he's above the law but Obama's
[01:50:44.320 --> 01:50:48.200]  been involved in it as well and then and then Henry Kissinger is afraid to fly
[01:50:48.200 --> 01:50:51.200]  around different parts of the world because there's indictments out for him
[01:50:51.200 --> 01:50:56.320]  and there should be because it was like hey they're al-Qaeda no they're not they
[01:50:56.320 --> 01:51:00.080]  torture people to get fake confessions good guys don't torture we've already
[01:51:00.080 --> 01:51:05.400]  had big discussions about this and there is no rule of law if they break the law
[01:51:05.400 --> 01:51:08.920]  and don't get in trouble then there is no law just like Obama has opened the
[01:51:08.920 --> 01:51:13.800]  border outside of law and is involved in human smuggling if he doesn't get in
[01:51:13.800 --> 01:51:19.840]  trouble then the sky is the limit that's my view well I also unconfirmed they
[01:51:19.840 --> 01:51:30.280]  told me that Egypt is seeking crimes are seeking criminal actions on Obama and
[01:51:30.280 --> 01:51:33.400]  his administration that's true that I mean that came out world that daily six
[01:51:33.400 --> 01:51:37.320]  eight months ago they caught him shipping money out of Kenya with Obama's
[01:51:37.320 --> 01:51:42.320]  cousin by the tens of millions into radical jihad's to launch the war you
[01:51:42.320 --> 01:51:46.600]  saw our media Anderson Cooper cheering on the Muslim Brotherhood burning up
[01:51:46.600 --> 01:51:52.000]  churches and crucifying people literally and then the the the the military was
[01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:56.000]  able to stop it and then arrested them and now they're executing them and I'm
[01:51:56.000 --> 01:52:01.000]  not lionizing the Egyptian military but Hossi Mubarak and that whole crew
[01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:06.080]  before were angels compared to the group and and so it really shows how out of
[01:52:06.080 --> 01:52:11.520]  control and what revolutionaries the people running our country are I mean
[01:52:11.520 --> 01:52:18.520]  Obama has been caught it's come out in their courts the documents financing the
[01:52:18.520 --> 01:52:25.800]  attempted overthrow of Libya Egypt and Syria interesting but think about how
[01:52:25.800 --> 01:52:35.760]  wild that is very interesting I think Sony is a false flag I don't think
[01:52:35.760 --> 01:52:42.120]  North Korea did it and I think the people need to stop allowing us to be
[01:52:42.120 --> 01:52:49.440]  divided with these assassinations of the police and everything by the way we
[01:52:49.440 --> 01:52:54.320]  now have it the interview now available on Google Play and YouTube but they're
[01:52:54.320 --> 01:52:58.760]  charging right let's click on it and see if yeah it's customers click on it guys
[01:52:58.760 --> 01:53:02.520]  on TV right now and we'll see you are on the internet right now let's see how
[01:53:02.520 --> 01:53:08.600]  much it cost let's go to Google Play yeah let let's put that out cuz they
[01:53:08.600 --> 01:53:12.320]  announced just a hour ago that they were gonna make it available the headline
[01:53:12.320 --> 01:53:16.240]  is it's now available let's get a screenshot of that and get it in Kurt
[01:53:16.240 --> 01:53:20.400]  Nemo's article all right sir God bless you appreciate your call sorry if I
[01:53:20.400 --> 01:53:24.240]  sounded distracted they just put that on screen it's a very interactive radio
[01:53:24.240 --> 01:53:27.960]  show Lee and Georgia we skipped this network break go ahead you're on the
[01:53:27.960 --> 01:53:35.040]  air hi Alex hey brother how are you good hope you're having a merry Christmas
[01:53:35.040 --> 01:53:40.200]  here ready to ring a new year here I have a couple of good just a quick
[01:53:40.200 --> 01:53:45.080]  questions for you what should one on do in this next year to you know prepare
[01:53:45.080 --> 01:53:49.240]  ourselves for the year what do you think should be prescribed for people like us
[01:53:49.240 --> 01:53:55.800]  to be safe in your world you know in the world we live in that's so weird man all
[01:53:55.800 --> 01:54:01.480]  I know is we're safer by getting our heart right with God by not living
[01:54:01.480 --> 01:54:07.880]  outside our means and by reaching out to other people and trying to educate them
[01:54:07.880 --> 01:54:12.440]  because the ignorance of the mass of people is what allows the tyrants to
[01:54:12.440 --> 01:54:16.760]  operate and take control of society so every person that's aware of the
[01:54:16.760 --> 01:54:21.680]  magician scams that's aware of the hat tricks that's aware that there's not
[01:54:21.680 --> 01:54:27.080]  really a rabbit in that hat there's a trapdoor on the table that is what as
[01:54:27.080 --> 01:54:33.200]  Thomas Jefferson said a highly informed and armed and free citizenry is all
[01:54:33.200 --> 01:54:36.480]  that is needed to cure tyranny to paraphrase him he said if you have an
[01:54:36.480 --> 01:54:42.520]  educated informed motivated population that loves liberty tyranny will vanish
[01:54:42.520 --> 01:54:48.760]  like phantoms at dawn and that's really it I mean if we have an informed public
[01:54:48.760 --> 01:54:56.160]  none of this is able to happen I mean look they can't stage false flags like
[01:54:56.160 --> 01:54:59.520]  they could because our people are watching everywhere worldwide and even
[01:54:59.520 --> 01:55:02.840]  when we don't have somebody that catches them nobody buys it anymore I mean the
[01:55:02.840 --> 01:55:07.440]  system has no credibility right now but they intended to get to that point that
[01:55:07.440 --> 01:55:12.000]  implode the old system to bring in an even greater tyranny we don't want to
[01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:16.040]  have a violent revolution that's their plan we want to have it be a peaceful
[01:55:16.040 --> 01:55:22.040]  transference of power and still stuff won't be perfect but we won't be in this
[01:55:22.040 --> 01:55:28.280]  deep cycle of corruption right now I think you are waking up the American
[01:55:28.280 --> 01:55:33.920]  people it's anything to say that we focus on so much negative aspects of it
[01:55:33.920 --> 01:55:37.880]  and so much scare tactics as it were is there anything you could do to kind of
[01:55:37.880 --> 01:55:42.840]  positive reinforce to do stuff to make people sure sure I personally have
[01:55:42.840 --> 01:55:45.840]  noticed it gets people motivated to hear the truth hey your house is on fire
[01:55:45.840 --> 01:55:49.320]  you better get out of it that's not fair mongering if it's happening I'll be
[01:55:49.320 --> 01:55:53.080]  quite frank I don't control most the ads on the network when you hear ads it's
[01:55:53.080 --> 01:55:56.280]  something I endorse I hear ads are like the end of the world will happen at this
[01:55:56.280 --> 01:56:01.080]  day come here I mean that makes me really mad but so there is stuff that goes
[01:56:01.080 --> 01:56:05.280]  along with this there's people that take advantage of our message nothing's
[01:56:05.280 --> 01:56:10.560]  perfect but what I say I really believe and to come out and say the Sony
[01:56:10.560 --> 01:56:15.120]  thing's fake I don't think of that as fear mongering I mean it shows people
[01:56:15.120 --> 01:56:19.920]  hey they're coming to censor the web let's not let them it's not fear mongering
[01:56:19.920 --> 01:56:23.440]  of sopa and syspa according to the inventor of the internet and others
[01:56:23.440 --> 01:56:28.960]  ends freedom of speech just on these things though um would you agree that
[01:56:28.960 --> 01:56:34.080]  um that maybe um I mean it is like someone's uninitiated they they might
[01:56:34.080 --> 01:56:38.280]  actually become more fearful by listening to your show and I wouldn't want
[01:56:38.280 --> 01:56:42.400]  them to definitely steer in the wrong direction and you know to just be you
[01:56:42.400 --> 01:56:46.480]  don't want people to be scared right you want people to be awake absolutely but
[01:56:46.480 --> 01:56:52.080]  but we're talking apples and oranges here there are undoubtedly mentally ill
[01:56:52.080 --> 01:56:55.320]  people that are already out there that are going to hear about me covering
[01:56:55.320 --> 01:57:00.760]  serious issues and get more upset that's not my problem okay I mean if a
[01:57:00.760 --> 01:57:05.160]  hurricane blows in and I tell people take shelter I'm not fear mongering if
[01:57:05.160 --> 01:57:09.680]  somebody runs to take shelter falls down the stairs and breaks their neck I did
[01:57:09.680 --> 01:57:13.320]  something moral and good saying a category five hurricane setting you
[01:57:13.320 --> 01:57:16.240]  might want to get to shelter or drive out of the area somebody might have a
[01:57:16.240 --> 01:57:19.760]  car wreck driving down the road to get out of the you know Houston that's not
[01:57:19.760 --> 01:57:25.040]  my problem I do what's moral and just justice be done may the heavens fall
[01:57:25.040 --> 01:57:29.160]  they count on people not being scared of the new world order not being
[01:57:29.160 --> 01:57:33.640]  concerned about real threats but scared of fake threats I say don't be scared of
[01:57:33.640 --> 01:57:37.480]  fake threats be concerned about real threats and make preparation to meet
[01:57:37.480 --> 01:57:43.480]  them and so no I'm not trying to scare people but if someone isn't already
[01:57:43.480 --> 01:57:48.280]  seriously concerned maybe call it scared something's wrong with them I mean one
[01:57:48.280 --> 01:57:51.280]  of the best bumper stickers ever said if you're not upset you ain't paying
[01:57:51.280 --> 01:57:57.040]  attention I mean what founded this country was not trusting government
[01:57:57.040 --> 01:58:01.960]  keeping government small trusting local trying to be honored based and not that
[01:58:01.960 --> 01:58:08.240]  we were perfect now it's all about flim flam and glitz and the surface the
[01:58:08.240 --> 01:58:16.000]  packaging not it's all about form over reality packaging over bona fides and
[01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:21.560]  people get sold on do what the mainstream media says you'll have success in my
[01:58:21.560 --> 01:58:26.000]  experience do what the mainstream media says you won't have success and so I'm
[01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:29.520]  just here doing what I do it's hard enough to cover every angle of this and
[01:58:29.520 --> 01:58:33.000]  so that's what it comes down to but people should be scared they're coming
[01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:36.360]  after our guns they always say don't be scared we don't want your guns as they
[01:58:36.360 --> 01:58:42.180]  try to take them so see we're the antidote to that yes if they want to call
[01:58:42.180 --> 01:58:50.280]  it fear porn good I'm trying to stop race right I called it before it started as
[01:58:50.280 --> 01:58:54.640]  the year is coming to a close we all pause to reflect on what's happened in

[02:11:30.160 --> 02:11:36.800]  situation with the interview I mean we've caught him inside job Obama gets
[02:11:36.800 --> 02:11:39.760]  to stand up and defend the First Amendment while he's attacking it
[02:11:39.760 --> 02:11:45.040]  domestically I mean this thing is like a prism or what I call a Rosetta stone to
[02:11:45.040 --> 02:11:52.760]  decode how the system works a very cynical ploy a great distraction that's
[02:11:52.760 --> 02:11:56.640]  my view Lionel I don't know your view first as a media analyst give us your
[02:11:56.640 --> 02:12:01.680]  take on this Alex is brilliant now you're from Texas I'm a professional
[02:12:01.680 --> 02:12:06.600]  wrestling fan you're probably from the days of the Von Erick's oh yeah okay in
[02:12:06.600 --> 02:12:13.640]  wrestling we use a term is called a work an angle to fix this was classic let me
[02:12:13.640 --> 02:12:17.560]  tell you what I found out this week I had a friend of mine we all have friends
[02:12:17.560 --> 02:12:21.440]  like this Alex who say what are you talking about you and your conspiracies
[02:12:21.440 --> 02:12:26.560]  in your false flag and you're you're a true sir and you're some kind of a nut
[02:12:26.560 --> 02:12:31.080]  job and everything you see I said I'm not a true yeah crazy you and you're
[02:12:31.080 --> 02:12:39.000]  inside false flag you make me sick okay true story same guy Alex I should go
[02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:44.080]  blind if I'm making this up same guy he says you know what this is don't you
[02:12:44.080 --> 02:12:50.400]  so false flag it's an inside job I said what I said are you saying this is a
[02:12:50.400 --> 02:12:56.320]  conspiracy theory you better believe it a false flag I said wait a minute so you
[02:12:56.320 --> 02:13:02.520]  recognize false flags you understand the calculus behind the conspiracy theory
[02:13:02.520 --> 02:13:09.440]  the false flag the diversion the rules the work you understand this you
[02:13:09.440 --> 02:13:13.920]  understood this concept the whole time but it doesn't happen to governments but
[02:13:13.920 --> 02:13:20.560]  Sony you think Sony is able to do it so Alex we're on and you hit on it we're on
[02:13:20.560 --> 02:13:27.560]  the verge of bringing people into the camp so to speak now Sony is brilliant
[02:13:27.560 --> 02:13:33.600]  number one remember this look who came out smelling like a rose George Cloney
[02:13:33.600 --> 02:13:39.120]  limited hangout let's use all our terms like WikiLeaks like a song they give it
[02:13:39.120 --> 02:13:44.640]  they get to to smear all the prima donna actors and directors they can't
[02:13:44.640 --> 02:13:50.840]  stand the good ones rise at the top they get to purge all the deadweight
[02:13:50.840 --> 02:13:58.960]  executives promote a movie that nobody would have watched and Kim Jong-un in a
[02:13:58.960 --> 02:14:08.920]  country just got what 12 computers he come on buddy this is beautiful
[02:14:08.920 --> 02:14:15.240]  Kim Jong-un is saying what is hack have you ever seen the pictures of Kim sitting
[02:14:15.240 --> 02:14:23.480]  in his computer room here's the best one they said the internet is down in North
[02:14:23.480 --> 02:14:32.240]  Korea down it's 12 people but then it gets better because they get to try to
[02:14:32.240 --> 02:14:36.400]  pass cybersecurity laws free speech laws Obama gets to come out and defend free
[02:14:36.400 --> 02:14:41.720]  speech but the Hollywood reporter inside job they say Sony look at these
[02:14:41.720 --> 02:14:48.120]  terms Fox News inside job and now I'm seeing terms of the news like Sony
[02:14:48.120 --> 02:14:53.840]  pulled a false flag that's a great way you put it though the public now gets
[02:14:53.840 --> 02:14:59.040]  the calculus of false flag that anybody in law enforcement or a prosecutor knows
[02:14:59.040 --> 02:15:02.880]  a lot of time crimes are inside jobs why can't it be an inside job when it's
[02:15:02.880 --> 02:15:08.080]  government or a corporation and and you know what this does from now on Alex for
[02:15:08.080 --> 02:15:13.240]  the first time in your illustrious career from now on when you're talking to
[02:15:13.240 --> 02:15:19.200]  somebody they say I don't know Alex you know you're asking me to disbelieve my
[02:15:19.200 --> 02:15:22.920]  government this is from somebody doesn't know history you say remember that Sony
[02:15:22.920 --> 02:15:29.240]  hack yeah well that's oh yes so what it does is it's like teaching a child you
[02:15:29.240 --> 02:15:32.760]  know when you have kids and you teach them things like the wind and a pet dies
[02:15:32.760 --> 02:15:38.760]  and Santa and various things these are like little introductory legends and
[02:15:38.760 --> 02:15:44.520]  and and allegories that allow you to understand the bigger picture oh Alex
[02:15:44.520 --> 02:15:51.520]  it's it's beautiful but I gotta tell you this much and also you should also know
[02:15:51.520 --> 02:15:55.400]  something when you've got and for the first time well not too much I feel kind
[02:15:55.400 --> 02:16:01.160]  of sorry for Obama who comes out here and he must be backstage saying look I

[02:16:31.880 --> 02:16:37.800]  Korea will be measured because they didn't do anything because it's a con it's a
[02:16:37.800 --> 02:16:48.080]  work it's a ruse it's a conspiracy do you hear me it's a false flag dive dive

[02:24:55.400 --> 02:25:12.080]  I had the opportunity last evening to review the video of the incident and
[02:25:12.080 --> 02:25:21.320]  what I saw in the in this incident it's not what people portray this is not a
[02:25:21.320 --> 02:25:28.160]  policeman in the city of Berkeley half cock one out and as we say you know
[02:25:28.160 --> 02:25:34.720]  black lives matter this was not the case this is you couldn't even compare this
[02:25:34.720 --> 02:25:41.760]  with Ferguson or the gardener case in New York the gardener case in New York
[02:25:41.760 --> 02:25:51.160]  they had the video Ferguson they did not we have the video and I can assure you
[02:25:51.160 --> 02:25:57.800]  that what's on the video is what we're going to use the city of Berkeley will
[02:25:57.800 --> 02:26:02.200]  do be doing the investigation along with the St. Louis and parallel with the
[02:26:02.200 --> 02:26:10.720]  St. Louis County and our overall goal is to project the truth to the residents
[02:26:10.720 --> 02:26:19.720]  who we reviewed the video and it appears that that that that there was a gun
[02:26:19.720 --> 02:26:25.080]  pointed at the officer before the officer for our but we got to complete
[02:26:25.080 --> 02:26:29.640]  our investigation before we before we take a position everybody don't everybody
[02:26:29.640 --> 02:26:34.600]  don't die the same some people die because the policeman initiated some
[02:26:34.600 --> 02:26:39.680]  other people die wait a minute hold up that's the mayor of Berkeley there we
[02:26:39.680 --> 02:26:46.040]  got cut off by break line a line on media comms our guest and we're looking at
[02:26:46.040 --> 02:26:50.280]  this attempt to well I know what do you think's behind all the hype with this
[02:26:50.280 --> 02:26:53.840]  you're in New York where do you see all this going well first of all there's
[02:26:53.840 --> 02:26:56.840]  so many issues I want to say just one more thing about the Sony half before
[02:26:56.840 --> 02:27:01.240]  we move over Alex the legal implications of this are amazing just very
[02:27:01.240 --> 02:27:05.000]  quickly if you have a private corporation a company if you will that
[02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:09.720]  knowingly involved itself allegedly with a deliberate hacking of information to
[02:27:09.720 --> 02:27:14.520]  give the impression that there was an international incident to give the
[02:27:14.520 --> 02:27:18.000]  impression that another foreign power that is an enemy of the state with
[02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:23.800]  nuclear weapons if you know that if a company knows that and allow that to
[02:27:23.800 --> 02:27:26.840]  happen not to mention the monetary loss to all the theaters in the meantime
[02:27:26.840 --> 02:27:32.560]  Alex this is a legal significance of monumental proportion that has no
[02:27:32.560 --> 02:27:37.600]  precedent that being said what's happening in New York very quickly as
[02:27:37.600 --> 02:27:41.240]  you had these two officers who were killed this is officers Lou and Ramos they
[02:27:41.240 --> 02:27:49.600]  were sitting by doing nothing a lunatic a lunatic acting on his own Alex a
[02:27:49.600 --> 02:27:54.280]  lunatic who had a history of mental illness problems which is another topic
[02:27:54.280 --> 02:27:59.360]  for our concern in the criminal justice system but a lunatic a criminal the
[02:27:59.360 --> 02:28:04.640]  insane person who shot his girlfriend not because of Bill de Blasio the mayor
[02:28:04.640 --> 02:28:08.600]  not because of Alasherpton not because of the liberal media not because of
[02:28:08.600 --> 02:28:13.280]  anything other than himself and what we are doing here and what you're seeing
[02:28:13.280 --> 02:28:19.400]  in New York is people trying to apply this casuistic specious connection as to
[02:28:19.400 --> 02:28:24.720]  who was responsible for this Alex we have come to the point in this country
[02:28:24.720 --> 02:28:29.320]  where people don't recognize that they are responsible for their own behaviors
[02:28:29.320 --> 02:28:33.200]  if somebody goes out and does something horrible and they happen to say in
[02:28:33.200 --> 02:28:38.280]  passing I listen to Alex Jones I listen to Ozzy Osbourne I read the Bible I
[02:28:38.280 --> 02:28:45.720]  watch cartoons that is correlation versus cause there is no causative reason
[02:28:45.720 --> 02:28:51.200]  for this to occur and what's happening we're also seeing in New York regarding
[02:28:51.200 --> 02:28:57.440]  Eric Garner the man who was killed tragically he was not killed by the
[02:28:57.440 --> 02:29:04.400]  police he wasn't choked he wasn't killed he resisted arrest and thank God for
[02:29:04.400 --> 02:29:08.720]  this mayor of Berkeley because Alex what's happening is that there is no
[02:29:08.720 --> 02:29:12.920]  ability in this country anymore to critically think there used to be a
[02:29:12.920 --> 02:29:16.720]  guy on Ed Sullivan years ago this guy with a stick who was spin plates a bunch
[02:29:16.720 --> 02:29:21.840]  of plates yet six seven plates going at the same time we have multiple issues
[02:29:21.840 --> 02:29:25.240]  and because of this lack of critical thinking in this country because of this
[02:29:25.240 --> 02:29:32.640]  possibly this dirt of basic mentation we can't segregate the cop abuse from
[02:29:32.640 --> 02:29:37.200]  racism just because a black assailant is involved or a black person is shot
[02:29:37.200 --> 02:29:41.520]  either by a black officer that does not make it a racial matter I hear you let's
[02:29:41.520 --> 02:29:45.520]  break it down from every angle when we come back straight ahead and I agree
[02:29:45.520 --> 02:29:49.680]  with you on most those issues but I want to add some points we're on the March

[02:33:20.840 --> 02:33:25.440]  directions with Lionel our guest Lionel media
[02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:32.320]  I've got other articles here smartphone use changing our brains BBC a new
[02:33:32.320 --> 02:33:36.320]  article in info wars calm feds preparing for new surge of illegal use
[02:33:36.320 --> 02:33:42.920]  preparations coincide with this missile of sheriff or pyos amnesty lawsuit but
[02:33:42.920 --> 02:33:47.160]  going back and talking to Lionel I get as a former prosecutor whatever you go
[02:33:47.160 --> 02:33:52.760]  off the law and they could argue the law is any I've seen cops beating people
[02:33:52.760 --> 02:33:55.560]  with billy clubs and they raise their arm to block the blow and they call it
[02:33:55.560 --> 02:33:59.480]  resisting and I don't think Garner been arrested a bunch for you know selling
[02:33:59.480 --> 02:34:04.920]  cigarettes on the street or whatever it was a father of six but they do start
[02:34:04.920 --> 02:34:08.920]  choking him and then when they say put your arm behind your back well they've
[02:34:08.920 --> 02:34:13.960]  got him in a pen hold and they use any legal chokehold so I think I don't think
[02:34:13.960 --> 02:34:17.480]  they intended to kill him I don't think it was premeditated but I know how
[02:34:17.480 --> 02:34:23.960]  people watching that get extremely upset by it absolutely yeah no I know Alex
[02:34:23.960 --> 02:34:30.240]  absolutely because first of all if I were to represent the officer Pantaleo in
[02:34:30.240 --> 02:34:33.880]  this I put the medical examiner on and say tell me the cause of death did
[02:34:33.880 --> 02:34:37.440]  officer Pantaleo do it wasn't a chokehold while it wasn't a chokehold it
[02:34:37.440 --> 02:34:41.200]  wasn't a karate restraint it looked like it it was a badly applied something or
[02:34:41.200 --> 02:34:45.720]  other no no that's right let me face me that video we're not for that video but
[02:34:45.720 --> 02:34:51.040]  Alex that's not the case that's not the issue we have right now a number of
[02:34:51.040 --> 02:35:00.320]  people who are out there showing a disdain and an anger and a disgust with
[02:35:00.320 --> 02:35:06.360]  police abuses and you I believe and I are right there with you Alex we have been
[02:35:06.360 --> 02:35:11.480]  talking about the hyper militarization of the police for years before it was cool
[02:35:11.480 --> 02:35:16.520]  we talked about 1033 programs we talked about the fact that Sheriff Andy became
[02:35:16.520 --> 02:35:21.280]  Robocop we talked about and you did it first and I heard this to your credit
[02:35:21.280 --> 02:35:26.280]  Alex I another example where I'm thinking I don't think Alex is on the money
[02:35:26.280 --> 02:35:29.960]  with this because one day I'll never forget you said I have a story here of a
[02:35:29.960 --> 02:35:34.880]  police of a number of police departments that released or actually
[02:35:34.880 --> 02:35:40.280]  deemed people unfit to serve because our IQ scores were too high and I said well
[02:35:40.280 --> 02:35:45.800]  I think Alex finally got got a bad source sure enough so we live in a country
[02:35:45.800 --> 02:35:50.920]  where we are having this systematic almost systemic militarization of the
[02:35:50.920 --> 02:35:56.080]  police we're there for that we also Alex believe in the First Amendment and we
[02:35:56.080 --> 02:35:59.600]  believe the people have the right to do it however and we also go I don't want
[02:35:59.600 --> 02:36:04.640]  to speak for you but there is racism there has been racism but what I've
[02:36:04.640 --> 02:36:11.760]  just provide you provided for you Alex or three somewhat nuanced arguments that
[02:36:11.760 --> 02:36:17.800]  are not necessarily connected they're different and once the meme starts in
[02:36:17.800 --> 02:36:22.840]  this country once the hashtag is begun once the I can't breathe black lives
[02:36:22.840 --> 02:36:27.360]  matter we're off and running the hell with the facts I don't care what he did
[02:36:27.360 --> 02:36:34.680]  Eric Garner resisted arrest that got the ball rolling the proximate cause the
[02:36:34.680 --> 02:36:41.000]  initial impetus the momentum Alex you know better than anybody you have been
[02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:47.560]  out there in every conceivable protest and rally and when the cops come to you
[02:36:47.560 --> 02:36:53.720]  you know the rules and you may say I'm gonna win in court I have a First
[02:36:53.720 --> 02:36:58.760]  Amendment right but you're not an idiot there's an old expression you can beat
[02:36:58.760 --> 02:37:03.560]  the rap but you can't beat the ride Eric Garner and we always have to say
[02:37:03.560 --> 02:37:09.840]  this it was a tragedy that he died he doesn't deserve I know that we all know
[02:37:09.840 --> 02:37:14.640]  that but here was a guy on Staten Island Richmond County where a number of
[02:37:14.640 --> 02:37:19.920]  store owners called the cops and said he's back get him out of here we're
[02:37:19.920 --> 02:37:24.800]  we're taxpayers he's back what are you supposed to do as a police officer I'm
[02:37:24.800 --> 02:37:30.080]  sorry man why well in the scheme of things selling Lucy's is really not a
[02:37:30.080 --> 02:37:37.760]  big deal excuse me that's the law get him out of here now I'm not saying that
[02:37:37.760 --> 02:37:42.440]  anything other than would people please when you have these talks with your
[02:37:42.440 --> 02:37:47.960]  sons whether they're African-American or what say that yes son we understand
[02:37:47.960 --> 02:37:53.840]  sometimes he's pleased but don't resist arrest don't mouth off let me tell you
[02:37:53.840 --> 02:37:58.240]  what happened here in New York we had after Eric Garner our mayor de Blasio
[02:37:58.240 --> 02:38:02.960]  who was married to an African-American who has mixed racial kids it's fine
[02:38:02.960 --> 02:38:08.480]  he's after he gave his speech as the administrator of a multi-billion dollar
[02:38:08.480 --> 02:38:14.360]  corporation called the city of New York after he spoke as mayor not as a
[02:38:14.360 --> 02:38:19.640]  progressive not as somebody who vacations and honeymoons in Cuba not at
[02:38:19.640 --> 02:38:25.560]  no no no you're a mayor after he did it he said and by the way and I thought oh
[02:38:25.560 --> 02:38:30.880]  god here we go but either by the way you kind of get it Obama you know I see the
[02:38:30.880 --> 02:38:36.080]  Eric Garner's I see myself or I see my son and I've had conversations with my
[02:38:36.080 --> 02:38:42.600]  son and the police went berserk what are you doing you're in essence
[02:38:42.600 --> 02:38:46.600]  understanding you're calling for calm doing your thing but you're tacitly
[02:38:46.600 --> 02:38:53.520]  Alex countenancing understanding giving heft and weight and card launch to those
[02:38:53.520 --> 02:38:57.960]  individuals who might do something stupid now even though that was excessive
[02:38:57.960 --> 02:39:03.200]  that did not inspire this lunatic in Baltimore let me back up for a minute I
[02:39:03.200 --> 02:39:08.120]  agree that most business mentally ill people the point is though that when the
[02:39:08.120 --> 02:39:13.100]  cops get run over in Denver at a protest they're protecting and then the
[02:39:13.100 --> 02:39:19.920]  crowd chants you know hit them or kill them or whatever or we see the media
[02:39:19.920 --> 02:39:24.880]  hyping cops being shot that will cause mentally ill people you can't say it's
[02:39:24.880 --> 02:39:29.800]  the media's fault in court you couldn't convict them from my lay understanding
[02:39:29.800 --> 02:39:33.000]  but you can sit back and make the judgment that they're fanning the flames
[02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:37.480]  Alex you know what you and I are doing right now fanning the flames you know
[02:39:37.480 --> 02:39:41.720]  George Washington did you fan the flame Muhammad Gandhi Martin Luther King fan
[02:39:41.720 --> 02:39:45.920]  the flame because if you don't fan a flame then we're talking pablum and
[02:39:45.920 --> 02:39:50.080]  that's the way it goes because there's an old idea between correlation and
[02:39:50.080 --> 02:39:53.480]  cause you for this all the time people use this idea that marijuana is a
[02:39:53.480 --> 02:39:57.760]  gateway drug that marijuana causes heroin addiction no let me tell you
[02:39:57.760 --> 02:40:01.320]  what you also have here I want all of your viewers and listeners to pay
[02:40:01.320 --> 02:40:05.560]  attention to this we have something that we're going to have the advent of a
[02:40:05.560 --> 02:40:11.920]  media superstars name is Pat Lynch Pat Lynch is the union head of the
[02:40:11.920 --> 02:40:17.920]  patrolman's beloved benevolent association by the way on my website at
[02:40:17.920 --> 02:40:23.680]  Lionelmedia.com there is a link of how you can donate if you want to the New
[02:40:23.680 --> 02:40:29.960]  York City widows and children's fund to help the family members because if you
[02:40:29.960 --> 02:40:33.880]  want to donate at Christmas time help the family members who are left behind
[02:40:33.880 --> 02:40:39.880]  that being said Pat Lynch when he heard this he went berserk meaning the
[02:40:39.880 --> 02:40:45.960]  Blasio's statement about his son so what he did was he instructed all of his
[02:40:45.960 --> 02:40:50.240]  officers if they wanted they could download a form this is before this
[02:40:50.240 --> 02:40:53.880]  tragedy that said I do not want the speaker of the city council and if you
[02:40:53.880 --> 02:40:58.320]  don't want the mayor at my funeral in the event I'm killed in the line of duty
[02:40:58.320 --> 02:41:05.480]  how awfully pythonic and vatic that was impression sadly lo and behold we have
[02:41:05.480 --> 02:41:10.120]  this and when the officer went up the Blasio walked in to check on him the
[02:41:10.120 --> 02:41:17.320]  police turned their back he also was late in going to try to be to give his
[02:41:17.320 --> 02:41:22.840]  sympathies to the family governor Cuomo came in Alex what I want you to pay
[02:41:22.840 --> 02:41:27.040]  attention to is we're already talking about this they're talking about New
[02:41:27.040 --> 02:41:33.800]  York going back to the days of the 70s and as you know there is a feel that
[02:41:33.800 --> 02:41:39.400]  people get bad guys on the street a feeling of kind of who's in charge what's
[02:41:39.400 --> 02:41:46.020]  going on because there is a balance Alex a balance between police doing their
[02:41:46.020 --> 02:41:50.760]  jobs and let me just say something also you mentioned that the arrest you know
[02:41:50.760 --> 02:41:55.240]  Alex arrest is like childbirth many people have never seen a childbirth but
[02:41:55.240 --> 02:41:58.280]  they know it's done and they think it's beautiful and then they see it for the
[02:41:58.280 --> 02:42:01.720]  first time up close and personal and they say this is the most disgusting thing
[02:42:01.720 --> 02:42:04.480]  I've ever seen in my life I don't want to have a part of it well the same thing
[02:42:04.480 --> 02:42:09.960]  goes for arrests there are 316.1 million Americans in this country and none of
[02:42:09.960 --> 02:42:15.600]  them killed any cops in response to this except for this one lone lunatic so
[02:42:15.600 --> 02:42:22.280]  police officers there's like 45 48,000 in New York and 82nd Airborne is huge
[02:42:22.280 --> 02:42:27.000]  there was this group of people that have to exert power but they can't go over
[02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:31.800]  the line they can't be mealy mouth they can't sing kumbaya they can look like
[02:42:31.800 --> 02:42:36.440]  Gandhi but they can't be militarized goons either we understand that then you
[02:42:36.440 --> 02:42:43.920]  have people who Alex enjoy the spirit of the movement they don't care the facts
[02:42:43.920 --> 02:42:48.000]  of the case they don't care about whether Eric Garner had anything to do to
[02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:52.760]  contribute to his own tragic death because the meme is going we've got
[02:42:52.760 --> 02:42:58.000]  hashtag we've got skittles remember that Trayvon Martin skittles Trayvon Martin
[02:42:58.000 --> 02:43:02.560]  attacked Jordan Zimmerman didn't matter we've got our meme going we've got the
[02:43:02.560 --> 02:43:06.720]  meme we've got the posters we've got our Instagrams and by God you're not going
[02:43:06.720 --> 02:43:10.800]  to deprive us of our movement. Well that's what I wanted to get to here Lionel
[02:43:10.800 --> 02:43:18.800]  your take on why the White House why the media why MSNBC is fanning racial
[02:43:18.800 --> 02:43:22.440]  division and I think it's pretty clear it's all they've got black unemployment
[02:43:22.440 --> 02:43:27.000]  doubled under Obama the country and so many fronts is falling apart despite
[02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:30.920]  all these cook economic numbers I think that's all you see is this
[02:43:30.920 --> 02:43:37.560]  regression right back to base racial politics Alex I don't think I don't
[02:43:37.560 --> 02:43:44.800]  disagree with you but I don't think this is a in American racial citizen we
[02:43:44.800 --> 02:43:51.160]  don't have gripes with each other it's the police right or wrong and factions
[02:43:51.160 --> 02:43:55.120]  of the African-American community or people of color or poor or whatever that
[02:43:55.120 --> 02:44:02.440]  is I wish they stopped saying we get along fine don't confuse that with
[02:44:02.440 --> 02:44:07.920]  everyday interplay and don't automatically jump with this patella
[02:44:07.920 --> 02:44:12.520]  reflex that whenever you see somebody who is black involved that it's race
[02:44:12.520 --> 02:44:17.680]  Eric Garner the man who died in Staten Island was not killed because he's black
[02:44:17.680 --> 02:44:24.600]  Michael Brown was not killed because he's black a Kai Gurley a young man who was
[02:44:24.600 --> 02:44:28.880]  killed in the stairwell of his apartment who was shot because it was dark
[02:44:28.880 --> 02:44:35.540]  maybe by accident was not killed because he was black Kelly Thomas horrible
[02:44:35.540 --> 02:44:40.560]  homeless schizophrenic man Fullerton was not killed because he was white would
[02:44:40.560 --> 02:44:45.080]  you stop this thing that people are killing by the way there's a movie out
[02:44:45.080 --> 02:44:50.680]  now Selma which I I commend to you look at what happens you want to see
[02:44:50.680 --> 02:44:54.360]  racism you want to see Bull Connor you want to see the Edmund Pettus bridge
[02:44:54.360 --> 02:44:59.560]  that's it you I hear you let's shift gears out of this and talk about some
[02:44:59.560 --> 02:45:03.520]  of the inside stuff you said that's happening in in New York City because
[02:45:03.520 --> 02:45:07.440]  clearly for whatever reason the media is hyping this as a political diversion
[02:45:07.440 --> 02:45:11.840]  it's it's growing even when cops you know shoot somebody on video who's aiming
[02:45:11.840 --> 02:45:15.400]  a gun at them down in Missouri it's becoming another big issue and people
[02:45:15.400 --> 02:45:20.640]  riot what's underlying that I think overall is economic decay kind of a
[02:45:20.640 --> 02:45:25.920]  sense of hopelessness by some and you know almost a trial of passage to go
[02:45:25.920 --> 02:45:29.840]  out and fight with the police the police it's becoming a trial of passage to
[02:45:29.840 --> 02:45:33.440]  become militarized and there's a sense with the derivatives and the rest of it
[02:45:33.440 --> 02:45:39.080]  that a collapse is coming I want to go to Victor and HB and Richard and Greg
[02:45:39.080 --> 02:45:43.560]  and Nelson here in a moment but specifically other stuff that you see
[02:45:43.560 --> 02:45:48.760]  going on in New York two things number one in when the mayor by the way the
[02:45:48.760 --> 02:45:53.440]  2017 New York's mayor's race is already underway I mean they're doing the b-roll
[02:45:53.440 --> 02:45:58.720]  they are I predict that a version of the three o'clock call what happens if you
[02:45:58.720 --> 02:46:02.440]  get that 3 a.m. call is going to be what happens if a police officer is killed
[02:46:02.440 --> 02:46:06.800]  on your watch what will your next mayor say the second thing is when mayor
[02:46:06.800 --> 02:46:11.320]  Bill de Blasio was elected on the day as you saw building Hillary Clinton because
[02:46:11.320 --> 02:46:16.160]  Alex he showed to a lot of people not just in New York but the voice of the
[02:46:16.160 --> 02:46:21.480]  progressive of a new faction a new arm a new wing of the Democratic Liberal
[02:46:21.480 --> 02:46:26.880]  Party and all eyes were on him they were talking about him in 2016 I mean he was
[02:46:26.880 --> 02:46:33.400]  the dandy that is over as he has these moments of silence I submit he has a
[02:46:33.400 --> 02:46:38.080]  moment of silence for the death knell of his political career that's number one
[02:46:38.080 --> 02:46:47.080]  number two Al Sharpton Alex in the city of New York Al Sharpton has provided a
[02:46:47.080 --> 02:46:51.800]  meme a patella reflex if you say Al Sharpton they say Tawanna Brawler you
[02:46:51.800 --> 02:46:56.360]  like you cannot believe people who don't even know who Tawanna Brawley is they
[02:46:56.360 --> 02:47:03.680]  just say this for years people have been saying how does he do it I think he's a
[02:47:03.680 --> 02:47:08.520]  genius like the Royal Family is a genius for cunning the people of Britain to pay
[02:47:08.520 --> 02:47:12.560]  for these inbred but that's a different story so people are wondering how is it
[02:47:12.560 --> 02:47:17.680]  what is it Al Sharpton meeting with the attorney with with the attorney general
[02:47:17.680 --> 02:47:21.520]  this country picking hand picking will help selecting the new US attorney here
[02:47:21.520 --> 02:47:25.400]  in New York meeting with the mayor imagine this there's this picture in
[02:47:25.400 --> 02:47:30.480]  New York news of Al Sharpton city with Bill de Blasio the mayor and Bill
[02:47:30.480 --> 02:47:35.280]  Bratton the commissioner and there's Al Sharpton national TV show four and a
[02:47:35.280 --> 02:47:42.360]  half million dollars in back taxes etc etc etc what is it now I call this the
[02:47:42.360 --> 02:47:47.280]  Bill Cosby moment Bill Cosby had these allegations for 45 plus years and all
[02:47:47.280 --> 02:47:52.600]  of a sudden it changed something happened don't know why Hannibal Burris who
[02:47:52.600 --> 02:47:57.000]  cares the momentum switched you are not going to be seeing Al Sharpton at the
[02:47:57.000 --> 02:48:00.720]  White House you are not going to be seeing him at Gracie Mansion or in City
[02:48:00.720 --> 02:48:06.120]  Hall two different political trajectories in New York have just gone by the
[02:48:06.120 --> 02:48:11.040]  board Mayor de Blasio and Al Sharpton you are going to see a complete and total
[02:48:11.040 --> 02:48:17.120]  re-re-fabrication of that Mayor de Blasio is doomed you're not going to be
[02:48:17.120 --> 02:48:21.840]  seeing this will forever be his centerpiece and Al Sharpton finally
[02:48:21.840 --> 02:48:27.760]  because even though Alex he has never said or advocated violence and even
[02:48:27.760 --> 02:48:33.000]  though other people around him said one dead cop you can't be responsible for
[02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:38.080]  sometimes the momentum but it doesn't matter because in the city of New York
[02:48:38.080 --> 02:48:44.760]  people look at those two as being responsible add to this vector in this
[02:48:44.760 --> 02:48:49.600]  remember this name Pat Lynch who was the patrolman's the Union who is who is
[02:48:49.600 --> 02:48:56.640]  even more now more vocal saying that de Blasio and Al Sharpton have blood on
[02:48:56.640 --> 02:49:05.240]  their hands that mean that idea was so powerful right now people are realigning
[02:49:05.240 --> 02:49:10.120]  because up till now there there's a new sheriff in town so to speak a new
[02:49:10.120 --> 02:49:15.040]  directory a new vector a new trajectory and do something because everything's
[02:49:15.040 --> 02:49:19.400]  changing and you're seeing power vacuum exactly let's go to some calls here in
[02:49:19.400 --> 02:49:22.800]  the calls we all over the map thank you Victor for holding you're on the year go
[02:49:22.800 --> 02:49:31.840]  ahead yes hi Linode and mr. Jones good morning it's really good to talk to you
[02:49:31.840 --> 02:49:41.360]  both you guys gonna talk to you go ahead I think it's absolutely insane what's
[02:49:41.360 --> 02:49:49.200]  going on with the whole racism thing I just can't really comprehend the mind
[02:49:49.200 --> 02:49:56.120]  set of the majority of people and how they sort of can literally like hop and
[02:49:56.120 --> 02:50:03.720]  jump so quickly to something like that it just shows you how far people have
[02:50:03.720 --> 02:50:08.240]  their heads in the sand well in this culture the system tried to dump things
[02:50:08.240 --> 02:50:13.760]  down Ford Chevy Coke Pepsi and so they want us to either be on one side of the
[02:50:13.760 --> 02:50:18.000]  other of whatever paradigm the system puts out instead of judging each case as
[02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:23.240]  it comes I mean it's tribal thinking or it's it's it's group think it's mob
[02:50:23.240 --> 02:50:27.800]  psychology isn't it Lionel absolutely and the media look at the way they
[02:50:27.800 --> 02:50:32.940]  portray Cuba I'm a native Floridian nobody's talking they're making Raul
[02:50:32.940 --> 02:50:39.400]  Castro and Fidel Castro to be to romanticize Marxist these revolutionaries
[02:50:39.400 --> 02:50:48.400]  and they're talking about old Chevy's and cigars I'm gonna get your take on

[02:54:05.560 --> 02:54:10.000]  I'll be honest I have mixed feelings about Cuba I've studied it quite a bit
[02:54:10.000 --> 02:54:14.960]  never really lived in Florida though to experience it firsthand been to Florida
[02:54:14.960 --> 02:54:19.680]  a lot so I'm not even a really comment too deeply on because a short comment
[02:54:19.680 --> 02:54:27.080]  doesn't really say what I truly think is it's a it's a it's mixed feelings I
[02:54:27.080 --> 02:54:32.720]  like to go to Cuba and see it I know that a embargo just keeps the regime in
[02:54:32.720 --> 02:54:40.520]  power and that westernization might actually undermine it a lot of research
[02:54:40.520 --> 02:54:46.640]  shows that but to lionize or even to make Shagovar acute I mean I read one of
[02:54:46.640 --> 02:54:51.680]  the books he wrote at least I did the cheat sheet went to the subpage to see
[02:54:51.680 --> 02:54:56.200]  it for myself where he called Hispanic subhuman dumb little cockroaches things
[02:54:56.200 --> 02:55:01.760]  like that so many communists are so elitist and he saw himself as Spanish
[02:55:01.760 --> 02:55:05.840]  and then you see all these you know folks wearing the Shagovar shirts like
[02:55:05.840 --> 02:55:10.880]  it's sexy when he really was a mass murderer and Fidel Castro and Raul and
[02:55:10.880 --> 02:55:13.880]  the hundreds of thousands they've killed and the millions they've tortured and
[02:55:13.880 --> 02:55:18.160]  then how they romanticize it but at the same time I know the West has got its
[02:55:18.160 --> 02:55:23.060]  own forms of corruption and a bunch of mafias are mad that their island was
[02:55:23.060 --> 02:55:27.000]  taken from them so they want to keep that beef going what's your brief take
[02:55:27.000 --> 02:55:31.800]  shumming up the Cuba situation because yeah when they make it about old 57
[02:55:31.800 --> 02:55:35.760]  Chevy's because they can't manufacture cars like North Korea or they make it
[02:55:35.760 --> 02:55:42.000]  about cigars or scuba diving how great it would be it's it's really brushing
[02:55:42.000 --> 02:55:45.720]  over a lot of important history Alex what you just said right now is so
[02:55:45.720 --> 02:55:49.240]  terrific you know what you just did you know on you said if this is what I'm
[02:55:49.240 --> 02:55:55.120]  saying yes yes yes yes yes all I'm saying was that very simply ask one
[02:55:55.120 --> 02:55:58.240]  question what about the reparations of all the Cubans who had their property
[02:55:58.240 --> 02:56:03.320]  and their businesses and their land seized after the revolution is that
[02:56:03.320 --> 02:56:07.480]  coming up we talk about reparations for everybody else which is a good idea but
[02:56:07.480 --> 02:56:12.520]  if he Jones family lives in Havana or see in Fuego so wherever and all of a
[02:56:12.520 --> 02:56:16.560]  sudden that's gone is that in your family from day one is there any talk
[02:56:16.560 --> 02:56:20.320]  about that let me just say Alex there's not enough time to go through it but
[02:56:20.320 --> 02:56:25.360]  your nuance and the lionization of Che as some kind of semi-adic darling you know
[02:56:25.360 --> 02:56:28.840]  is another story let me throw one more thing at you about New York before I
[02:56:28.840 --> 02:56:35.480]  forget we've got to be careful also about we've got it at one time I understand
[02:56:35.480 --> 02:56:40.240]  there are conspiracies there are indeed false flags there are indeed but don't
[02:56:40.240 --> 02:56:44.160]  need your you have another group of people in in New York yeah I don't think
[02:56:44.160 --> 02:56:48.000]  the cops getting killed was a false flag that's exactly what I was gonna say but
[02:56:48.000 --> 02:56:51.320]  I mean the false flags jump out at you I'm not gonna get into all the points you
[02:56:51.320 --> 02:56:55.080]  learn how to recognize them and I just don't see any evidence of that let's go
[02:56:55.080 --> 02:56:58.120]  to people get mad at me for saying that just I just tell people what I think
[02:56:58.120 --> 02:57:03.240]  maybe I'm not right I agree Nelson in Florida you're on the air go ahead yeah
[02:57:03.240 --> 02:57:07.280]  we need an informed public and Lionel hit the nail on the head and how to do
[02:57:07.280 --> 02:57:11.160]  that with his buddy Dale Watson up there every city's got their favorite
[02:57:11.160 --> 02:57:17.320]  musicians that have a huge following if we do farm-aid y2k we hit it and
[02:57:17.320 --> 02:57:22.240]  everybody pushes this Mike Adams old keepers Ben Swann Max Kaiser Carolson
[02:57:22.240 --> 02:57:28.120]  Salante and you Alex and Russell brand hostess and we host this in every town and
[02:57:28.120 --> 02:57:33.680]  we do this as a parade not protest we had to have parades and we do it a three
[02:57:33.680 --> 02:57:36.880]  day event we get everybody there everybody takes us comes to the door
[02:57:36.880 --> 02:57:41.440]  like American rebirth parades the problem is it could be like a movement like the
[02:57:41.440 --> 02:57:45.360]  tea party it's hard to get organizations and people to work together in the
[02:57:45.360 --> 02:57:52.120]  schedules but that is certainly a good idea to make freedom a celebration not
[02:57:52.120 --> 02:57:56.960]  a war in the streets a velvet revolution great point glad you held to say
[02:57:56.960 --> 02:58:01.080]  that anything else and also yeah well if we get everybody involved we got the
[02:58:01.080 --> 02:58:05.200]  truckers we got bikers over past the dot org I mean we got everybody's working
[02:58:05.200 --> 02:58:08.440]  together that we just all need to coordinate if we coordinate our efforts
[02:58:08.440 --> 02:58:13.040]  it'll be easy we call we the people we all be carrying the same signs we the
[02:58:13.040 --> 02:58:16.320]  people you understand trying to coordinate something also makes it
[02:58:16.320 --> 02:58:20.200]  easy to chop the head off and it gets to believe me I've tried it we did enough
[02:58:20.200 --> 02:58:24.360]  over past type deals or whatever then then it congeals towards more
[02:58:24.360 --> 02:58:28.280]  centralization not centralization the other way but we're gonna go to some
[02:58:28.280 --> 02:58:32.120]  overdrive here why don't we do five more minutes to talk to Richard and Greg and

[03:00:48.680 --> 03:00:53.000]  this staged event let's now jam in a few final calls Richard you're on the air
[03:00:53.000 --> 03:01:00.480]  from Pennsylvania with Lionel go ahead. Hi Lionel and Alex I used to be a former
[03:01:00.480 --> 03:01:07.480]  leftist and and when I woke up I sort of saw that everything was being
[03:01:07.480 --> 03:01:12.040]  balkanized on the left with this political correctness instead of actually
[03:01:12.040 --> 03:01:17.760]  looking at the minutiae of what's going on what do you think that this has
[03:01:17.760 --> 03:01:22.560]  done to the political atmosphere. I think it's dumbed it down and supercharged it
[03:01:22.560 --> 03:01:26.280]  I mean the so-called lefts had a lot of good ideas in the 60s was trying to
[03:01:26.280 --> 03:01:30.800]  reform things but now it's just the dominant party and that's why it's so
[03:01:30.800 --> 03:01:34.800]  corrupt but they work with the Republican leadership as well I mean what
[03:01:34.800 --> 03:01:39.160]  do you say the political atmosphere Lionel. Ditto let me also say something
[03:01:39.160 --> 03:01:44.480]  that you brought up before understand that while you and I and I can speak for
[03:01:44.480 --> 03:01:47.760]  me but I think you and I Alex are very very careful not to misapply we don't
[03:01:47.760 --> 03:01:51.160]  want to false positive when it comes to conspiracies and false flags and inside
[03:01:51.160 --> 03:01:56.440]  jobs that's not part of our patella or pavlovian reflex however sometimes
[03:01:56.440 --> 03:02:02.240]  society shows that there are inadvertent beneficiaries and whenever there is a
[03:02:02.240 --> 03:02:08.280]  breakdown of order a destabilization whether in a country or internally
[03:02:08.280 --> 03:02:15.160]  domestically the ruling class always benefits so even though nobody suggests
[03:02:15.160 --> 03:02:20.600]  a direct hand or there's no evidence of it of these two officers being deliberately
[03:02:20.600 --> 03:02:27.400]  killed that does not mean that people are the inadvertent beneficiaries. It means
[03:02:27.400 --> 03:02:31.400]  you don't let a good crisis go to waste. Well my manual. That's right Richard
[03:02:31.400 --> 03:02:36.240]  great points Greg in New Jersey Merry Christmas go ahead. Oh my gosh you said
[03:02:36.240 --> 03:02:41.400]  Merry Christmas. I know I'm gonna be sent to a thought crime facility. That's
[03:02:41.400 --> 03:02:45.240]  right and Lionel here's a phrase from from back in the day lock and load Lionel.
[03:02:45.240 --> 03:02:50.640]  Yes sir. Lock and load you my friend. Absolutely well you know people say
[03:02:50.640 --> 03:02:55.880]  what can I do what can I do I'm powerless. Folks you got to get involved you
[03:02:55.880 --> 03:03:01.320]  got to take that extra hour out of your life and go either try and volunteer get
[03:03:01.320 --> 03:03:05.880]  involved with you know go downtown to your downtown council meeting. I was
[03:03:05.880 --> 03:03:09.720]  fortunate enough I know I got to let me interrupt you for just a minute a photo
[03:03:09.720 --> 03:03:14.200]  has now come in of Kim Jong-un hacking the United States I'm joking I mean the
[03:03:14.200 --> 03:03:20.720]  computer looks like something from the 50s go ahead sorry. What can I do what
[03:03:20.720 --> 03:03:24.320]  can I do it's like you just got to take that that one hour you just take one
[03:03:24.320 --> 03:03:28.040]  hour of your life and get involved and do something go to that town council
[03:03:28.040 --> 03:03:31.400]  meeting and get involved and do a little research on a topic that you know
[03:03:31.400 --> 03:03:36.000]  that means something to you. You know I got elected to my borough council several
[03:03:36.000 --> 03:03:42.000]  years ago. Great job. Yeah thank you and and and I and I do it and I enjoy it
[03:03:42.000 --> 03:03:46.080]  but also I try to educate people our town doesn't have Florida in the water
[03:03:46.080 --> 03:03:50.880]  and they never will have Florida put in the water. Things like that stuff with
[03:03:50.880 --> 03:03:54.920]  the common core the data mining you know I went to I went to different groups
[03:03:54.920 --> 03:04:00.640]  explain to them you know that their that your children's data is being accessed
[03:04:00.640 --> 03:04:04.400]  and distributed to different government agencies without your consent and
[03:04:04.400 --> 03:04:07.680]  knowledge do you know that and people didn't understand it didn't understand
[03:04:07.680 --> 03:04:11.440]  it first I said would you want to be accessing your credit card and then they
[03:04:11.440 --> 03:04:15.040]  get it so when you want to get people involved you got to put it in terms that
[03:04:15.040 --> 03:04:19.600]  makes sense to them and just and and to Greg I want to get you on as a city
[03:04:19.600 --> 03:04:23.080]  council member guess give us your full name and info you sound like a really
[03:04:23.080 --> 03:04:26.000]  well-spoken guy I love the way you do it you don't beat him up with a head like
[03:04:26.000 --> 03:04:29.520]  I do but you know and a different structure different folks you say did you
[03:04:29.520 --> 03:04:32.880]  know did you know and did you know that's one of the most effective ways I
[03:04:32.880 --> 03:04:36.040]  want to get you on as a guest we'll get your full name and number and info if
[03:04:36.040 --> 03:04:39.000]  you want to come on sometime for 30 minutes of the nightly news or something
