[00:00.000 --> 00:11.000]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[00:30.000 --> 00:59.000]  Well spectacular ladies and gentlemen that's how I describe it. Spectacular, bumbling and fumbling.
[00:59.000 --> 01:14.000]  The likes of which I've really never seen by Robert Muller. Hands shaking, clearly early stages of dementia.
[01:14.000 --> 01:24.000]  Bumbling throughout and the Democrats all harping over McGahn and all of that twisted testimony and it's just now wrapping up.
[01:24.000 --> 01:32.000]  We're going to have the Congressman Johnson who summed it up for Republicans I think best coming up next segment.
[01:32.000 --> 01:37.000]  We're going to have that here. I think it sums it up best but here's the bottom line.
[01:37.000 --> 02:06.000]  The Democrats are hell bent on a civil war in this country and all the dirt is on their side.
[02:06.000 --> 02:35.000]  But they think they can still selectively go after Trump and take him down and that because they still control parts of the gesture department that they'll be able to intimidate people into letting that one sided outcome take place and that's not what the calculus of the math shows and it's not what the American people are going to put up with either.
[02:35.000 --> 02:44.000]  Especially not by a party led by people like Ilhan Omar and AOC and that is who leads their party. That is who the SJWs are.
[02:44.000 --> 03:02.000]  That is what's being brewed and gestated and birthed out of the so called universities that are nothing but militant cancerous polyps bursting forth with giant metastasization.
[03:02.000 --> 03:28.000]  So when we come back we're going to have the closing comments by the Republican Congressman Johnson and then we're going to go right through the most powerful clips throughout this hour of Congressman Ratcliffe, Congressman Gohmert, Congressman Jordan, Congressman Gates, Congressman Buck, Congressman Biggs and others.
[03:28.000 --> 03:39.000]  Because the Democrats all read off the same piece of paper about obstruction and about Trump saying fire and then don't say fire. He's the president. He could fire anyone he wants in the justice department.
[03:39.000 --> 03:47.000]  If Congress then thinks that was a bad political move for a corruption point they have an indictment in the house, a trial in the Senate.
[03:47.000 --> 03:56.000]  But they don't have the votes for that so they're not going forward with the constitutional remedy that they have.
[03:56.000 --> 04:00.000]  They're not going forward with that because there's nothing there.
[04:00.000 --> 04:09.000]  So they just continue to act like the president's a Russian agent and that he didn't really get elected because they're the ones trying to steal the last election.
[04:09.000 --> 04:18.000]  They did steal the house in the midterm last year and they're intending to steal the 2020 election which they know Trump's going to win a huge landslide.
[04:18.000 --> 04:27.000]  They've been caught fixing all these polls against the president, fixing polls against other people, election fraud all over the country, millions and millions of people voting the names of dead people.
[04:27.000 --> 04:37.000]  Now we have a Google engineer blows whistle on how they are stealing the election and this person's gone public, a new Veritas bombshell.
[04:37.000 --> 04:51.000]  It's all up on infowars.com and infowars.com also has the live show you can spread to others at infowars.com forward slash show infowars.com forward slash show.
[04:51.000 --> 04:53.000]  I'm Alex Jones, stay with us.
[04:53.000 --> 05:16.000]  Before I started working at infowars I was not only a fan of Alex Jones and infowars.com but also the products at infowars.com and there's one product that's offered at infowars.com that is the elite of the supplements and that's DNA Force Plus.
[05:16.000 --> 05:23.000]  I remember when Alex first started talking about this with some of his special guests, telomeres and telomere support with your DNA.
[05:23.000 --> 05:32.000]  So I started to look into the science and what telomeres were and how it can improve your health and longevity when you protect your telomeres.
[05:32.000 --> 05:35.000]  So I started looking into DNA Force Plus but it's expensive.
[05:35.000 --> 05:36.000]  Why?
[05:36.000 --> 05:38.000]  Because it is an elite supplement.
[05:38.000 --> 05:48.000]  And then I started seeing other competitors coming up with competitive supplements for telomere support and they came and they went but DNA Force Plus is still there.
[05:48.000 --> 05:50.000]  It is the elite supplement.
[05:50.000 --> 06:12.000]  I get excited when DNA Force Plus is on sale because I know it's expensive so you should take advantage of 50% off DNA Force Plus at infowars.com.
[06:21.000 --> 06:37.000]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[06:37.000 --> 06:45.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live on this Wednesday, July 24, 2019, global transmission.
[06:45.000 --> 06:54.000]  And wow, what an incredible time to be alive. The wheels have come off completely for the Democrats on so many fronts.
[06:54.000 --> 07:03.000]  And we've got that exciting news throughout the next four hours for you obviously before the War Room comes on with our own Thomas Schreuer right here at the ATX InfoWars News Center in Austin, Texas.
[07:03.000 --> 07:15.000]  But wow, the Democrats all read off the same script. They brought up McGahn, Trump's lawyer, and well, Trump said, fire him. Well, maybe don't fire him and who that's obstruction.
[07:15.000 --> 07:20.000]  No, it's not because they told the president he wasn't under criminal investigation. Plus the president controls the executive branch.
[07:20.000 --> 07:24.000]  So you can only remove the president via Congress and impeachment and they know all that.
[07:24.000 --> 07:26.000]  But they think the public's ignorant.
[07:26.000 --> 07:30.000]  So they're playing along with no ones above the law. That's all they had.
[07:30.000 --> 07:35.000]  Well, the truth is, this is the mouse that roared versus the lion.
[07:35.000 --> 07:42.000]  There's nothing there on Trump. All the collusion with foreign governments is by the Democrats hating America is their staple.
[07:42.000 --> 07:44.000]  It's who they are.
[07:44.000 --> 07:58.000]  And so there was Mueller knowing that all the crimes were committed by his team that they were a rogue group set up by Rosenstein.
[07:58.000 --> 08:01.000]  After Trump got elected, they had been operating in secret.
[08:01.000 --> 08:08.000]  And then once they got in, they set up a special counsel when Trump was smart and got rid of Comey as a way to remove Trump from office.
[08:08.000 --> 08:11.000]  And that's what the emails say. That's what the text messages say.
[08:11.000 --> 08:18.000]  And they even paid their wives and husbands millions of dollars to run the threat fusion GPS garbage.
[08:18.000 --> 08:26.000]  So the crimes are so numerous and the lying to Congress and the perjury is just absolutely stunning.
[08:26.000 --> 08:31.000]  And then Bill Barr is there to cover all this up and to make peace with Trump.
[08:31.000 --> 08:38.000]  But the Democrats won't even follow the deal that they've made inside the DOJ with Trump that he won't prosecute them.
[08:38.000 --> 08:44.000]  He'll leave them alone and they just get out of the way and let us make America great again.
[08:44.000 --> 08:53.000]  That's what's happening. That's what's unfolding.
[08:53.000 --> 09:02.000]  And the Democrats are so politically blind and believe MSN that they're winning and believe all their fake polls that they're smoking their own dope
[09:02.000 --> 09:10.000]  and going over the edge of a cliff with Ilhan Omar and AOC and the rest of these harpies.
[09:10.000 --> 09:16.000]  I've got legions of articles here. ABC hides approval surge with voters says Trump's in trouble.
[09:16.000 --> 09:24.000]  Google engineer blows whistle. We are going to just let the biggest tech companies decide who wins every election from now on.
[09:24.000 --> 09:27.000]  That's all coming up in about an hour and a half.
[09:27.000 --> 09:33.000]  But it will take an hour and a half to go through the most important areas of the testimony today.
[09:33.000 --> 09:40.000]  And they're all so good. I was going to start with Congressman Johnson closing.
[09:40.000 --> 09:52.000]  But let's just let's just go to Congressman Ratcliffe laying out the fact that Mueller absolutely didn't even follow the special counsel rules or any of it and as a fraud.
[09:52.000 --> 09:55.000]  Here it is. Good morning, director.
[09:55.000 --> 10:01.000]  If you'll let me quickly summarize your opening statement this morning, you said in volume one on the issue of conspiracy,
[10:01.000 --> 10:09.000]  the special counsel determined that the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government.
[10:09.000 --> 10:11.000]  In its election interference activities.
[10:11.000 --> 10:19.000]  And then in volume two, for reasons that you explained, the special counsel did not make a determination on whether there was an obstruction of justice crime committed by the president.
[10:19.000 --> 10:20.000]  Is that fair?
[10:20.000 --> 10:21.000]  Yes, sir.
[10:21.000 --> 10:27.000]  All right. Now in explaining the special counsel did not make what you called a traditional prosecution or declamation decision,
[10:27.000 --> 10:32.000]  the report on the bottom of page two of volume two reads as follows.
[10:32.000 --> 10:41.000]  The evidence we obtained about the president's actions and intent presents difficult issues that prevent us from conclusively determining that no criminal conduct occurred.
[10:41.000 --> 10:48.000]  Accordingly, while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.
[10:48.000 --> 10:50.000]  Now, I read that correctly.
[10:50.000 --> 10:51.000]  Yes.
[10:51.000 --> 11:00.000]  All right. Now your report and today you said that all times the special counsel team operated under was guided by and followed justice department policies and principles.
[11:00.000 --> 11:13.000]  Now, which DOJ policy or principle sets forth a legal standard that an investigated person is not exonerated if their innocence from criminal criminal conduct is not conclusively determined?
[11:13.000 --> 11:15.000]  Can you repeat the last part of that question?
[11:15.000 --> 11:16.000]  Yeah.
[11:16.000 --> 11:28.000]  Which DOJ policy or principle set forth a legal standard that an investigated person is not exonerated if their innocence from criminal criminal conduct is not conclusively determined?
[11:28.000 --> 11:30.000]  Where does the language come from, director?
[11:30.000 --> 11:34.000]  Where is the DOJ policy that says that?
[11:34.000 --> 11:36.000]  Let me make it easier.
[11:36.000 --> 11:38.000]  Can I go ahead?
[11:38.000 --> 11:48.000]  Can you give me an example other than Donald Trump where the justice department determined that an investigated person was not exonerated because their innocence was not conclusively determined?
[11:48.000 --> 11:51.000]  I cannot, but this is a unique situation.
[11:51.000 --> 11:58.000]  Time is short. I've got five minutes. Let's just leave it at you. You can't find it because I'll tell you why. It doesn't exist.
[11:58.000 --> 12:07.000]  The special counsel's job, nowhere does it say that you were to conclusively determine Donald Trump's innocence or that the special counsel report should determine whether or not to exonerate him.
[12:07.000 --> 12:12.000]  It's not in any of the documents. It's not in your appointment order. It's not in the special counsel regulations.
[12:12.000 --> 12:17.000]  It's not in the OLC opinions. It's not in the justice manual and it's not in the principles of federal prosecution.
[12:17.000 --> 12:33.000]  Nowhere do those words appear together because respectfully, respectfully, director, it was not the special counsel's job to conclusively determine Donald Trump's innocence or to exonerate him because the bedrock principle of our justice system is a presumption of innocence.
[12:33.000 --> 12:39.000]  It exists for everyone. Everyone is entitled to it, including sitting presidents.
[12:39.000 --> 12:46.000]  And because there is a presumption of innocence, prosecutors never, ever need to conclusively determine it.
[12:46.000 --> 12:59.000]  Now, director, the special counsel applied this inverted burden of proof that I can't find and you said doesn't exist anywhere in the department policies and you used it to write a report.
[12:59.000 --> 13:14.000]  And the very first line of your report, the very first line of your report says, as you read this morning, it authorizes the special counsel to provide the attorney general with a confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination,
[13:14.000 --> 13:19.000]  declination decisions reached by the special counsel. That's the very first word of your report, right?
[13:19.000 --> 13:21.000]  That's correct.
[13:21.000 --> 13:28.000]  Here's the problem, director. The special counsel didn't do that. On volume one, you did.
[13:28.000 --> 13:38.000]  On volume two, with respect to potential obstruction of justice, the special counsel made neither a prosecution decision or a declination decision.
[13:38.000 --> 13:47.000]  You made no decision. You told us this morning and in your report that you made no determination. So respectfully, director, you didn't follow the special counsel regulations.
[13:47.000 --> 13:58.000]  It clearly says write a confidential report about decisions reached. Nowhere in here does it say write a report about decisions that weren't reached.
[13:58.000 --> 14:08.000]  You wrote 180 pages, 180 pages about decisions that weren't reached, about potential crimes that weren't charged or decided.
[14:08.000 --> 14:23.000]  And respectfully, respectfully by doing that, you managed to violate every principle and the most sacred of traditions about prosecutors not offering extra prosecutorial analysis about potential crimes that aren't charged.
[14:23.000 --> 14:33.000]  So Americans need to know this as they listen to the Democrats and socialists on the other side of the aisle as they do dramatic readings from this report.
[14:33.000 --> 14:42.000]  That volume two of this report was not authorized under the law to be written. It was written to a legal standard that does not exist at the Justice Department.
[14:42.000 --> 14:48.000]  And it was written in violation of every DOJ principle about extra prosecutorial commentary.
[14:48.000 --> 14:59.000]  I agree with the chairman this morning when he said Donald Trump is not above the law. He's not. But he damn sure shouldn't be below the law, which is where volume two of this report puts him.
[14:59.000 --> 15:06.000]  That's right. A total witch hunt in their own words, in their own documents designed to remove it from office.
[15:06.000 --> 15:18.000]  30 plus people, all of them Democrats except Robert Mueller. And then he works for both sides in the deep state.
[15:18.000 --> 15:25.000]  This is just an astounding, astonishing time to be alive. And I'm not going to bore you with what the Democrats had to say.
[15:25.000 --> 15:31.000]  I guess I'll play some of it, but it's all they read off the same piece of paper. McGahn, McGahn, McGahn, over and over again.
[15:31.000 --> 15:37.000]  And sure, we all know the Russiagate things are fraud, but imagine how much time it's stalled Trump trying to fix the country.
[15:37.000 --> 15:42.000]  And how it lets the Democrats run around and call everybody Russian agents. You know, they have congressional hearings all the time.
[15:42.000 --> 15:49.000]  We've played them here where they say Alex Jones works for the Russians. That's why we're running CIA operations on the Internet to shut him down.
[15:49.000 --> 15:54.000]  I am under attack by the deep stages like the president is. These people are criminal terrorists.
[15:54.000 --> 15:59.000]  These will be racketeering investigations of these criminals now. We'll be right back.
[15:59.000 --> 16:04.000]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[16:04.000 --> 16:09.000]  I sued the IRS in one. I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[16:09.000 --> 16:14.000]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[16:14.000 --> 16:21.000]  I can help you too. If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day. There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[16:21.000 --> 16:29.000]  Call 800-34-no-tax or go to my website, danpilla.com. That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[16:29.000 --> 16:38.000]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners, if you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup system but were waiting for prices too crazy to pass up,
[16:38.000 --> 16:41.000]  this will be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[16:41.000 --> 16:46.000]  Bill Hyde here. I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on our PPX microgrid system
[16:46.000 --> 16:53.000]  that's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity off the grid. The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here
[16:53.000 --> 16:55.000]  right on the East Bank of the Mississippi.
[16:55.000 --> 17:01.000]  Because of the flooding we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location and rather than move it back to the warehouse
[17:01.000 --> 17:07.000]  we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory.
[17:07.000 --> 17:13.000]  So here's what you should do right now. Check out the PPX microgrid system at myownpowergrid.com.
[17:13.000 --> 17:23.000]  Over $1,000 in great off the grid gear and a ton of bonuses too. In the best part, you're not going to pay $750 or $500 or even $200.
[17:23.000 --> 17:47.000]  Go to myownpowergrid.com to learn more. That's myownpowergrid.com.
[17:53.000 --> 18:03.000]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York. Marcus, you're on the air. Thanks for holding.
[18:03.000 --> 18:10.000]  Hey, I just want to say your show is a breath of fresh air. I talk to a lot of people here in New York City and one thing I can tell you is that
[18:10.000 --> 18:17.000]  almost nobody agrees with these wars. I think that the Neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know that
[18:17.000 --> 18:22.000]  that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public approaching 2020.
[18:22.000 --> 18:28.000]  That's it. I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency. It's the only way I think he can be defeated other than assassinating him.
[18:28.000 --> 18:29.000]  It's a time to be praying, my friend.
[18:29.000 --> 18:35.000]  I agree entirely. And the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying to shut you down, but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[18:35.000 --> 18:40.000]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old. I would love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[18:40.000 --> 18:48.000]  But if they do shut you down, no, you've gone into this war. You've won a lot of battles and there are a lot of people like myself and many others
[18:48.000 --> 18:54.000]  who are going to continue. We're going to keep fighting in the Info War, and even if something does happen to you or your show,
[18:54.000 --> 18:58.000]  know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[18:58.000 --> 19:00.000]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[19:00.000 --> 19:08.000]  The globalists are hyper-competitive scientific dictators. They are technocrats. They are control freaks in their own words,
[19:08.000 --> 19:15.000]  and they believe allowing you to live your own life and make your own decisions gets to the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[19:15.000 --> 19:19.000]  Now, we're fighting them hard in cyberspace. We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension.
[19:19.000 --> 19:26.000]  But one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.
[19:26.000 --> 19:31.000]  If I wasn't taking the highest-quality supplements for the Force Life.com, I couldn't do it.
[19:31.000 --> 19:41.000]  That's why we decided to take our original Secret 12 that was incredibly high-quality medical bottleman and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12.
[19:41.000 --> 19:47.000]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest-quality B-12 over-the-counter that you're going to find anywhere.
[19:47.000 --> 19:56.000]  It is amazing. Experience pure medical bottleman B-12 for yourself and fund the Second American Revolution against the tyrants at infowarsstore.com,
[19:56.000 --> 20:11.000]  infowarslife.com, or AAA-253-3139.
[20:26.000 --> 20:34.000]  My eyes are blind but I can see
[20:34.000 --> 20:40.000]  The snow face isn't on the tree
[20:40.000 --> 20:43.000]  The sun no longer sets the global screen
[20:43.000 --> 20:48.000]  The sun no longer sets me free
[20:48.000 --> 20:53.000]  We're going to get to the Mueller hearing and we're going to play the important parts, in my view.
[20:53.000 --> 20:58.000]  That means none of the Democrats because they just repeat the same thing like a bunch of Satanic parrots.
[20:58.000 --> 21:04.000]  But this right here, this other news coming up by the middle of the next hour is really serious.
[21:04.000 --> 21:13.000]  Yesterday we led with the fact that the Democrats and others are working with the Chai comms with the EU to plunge the U.S. economy.
[21:13.000 --> 21:18.000]  They admit to hurt Trump and hurt the American people.
[21:18.000 --> 21:23.000]  If that is a treason, then I don't know what is.
[21:23.000 --> 21:34.000]  And now, J.P. Morgan warns, dollar could lose status as world's dominant currency and they basically encourage rating agencies to devalue the dollar.
[21:34.000 --> 21:43.000]  When the Chinese currency is way over inflated compared to ours, and ours is inflated too, and they're the ones racing to do it.
[21:43.000 --> 21:51.000]  They're putting us in this impossible position and then J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs, all these groups are cheerleading for the Chai comms.
[21:51.000 --> 21:59.000]  Remember when the outgoing head of Goldman Sachs last year told Trump, you'll never stop China, the American century's over.
[21:59.000 --> 22:02.000]  I mean, these are nasty people.
[22:02.000 --> 22:06.000]  I had Thomas Burnett on one time, about to go live.
[22:06.000 --> 22:08.000]  He's one of these globalists that teaches, you know, get rid of America.
[22:08.000 --> 22:10.000]  America is part of world government now.
[22:10.000 --> 22:16.000]  And I had him on, he thought I was Alex S. Jones of the Shorenstein Center.
[22:16.000 --> 22:17.000]  John Harmon heard this.
[22:17.000 --> 22:22.000]  It was back when he was produced on the show, like 10 years ago.
[22:22.000 --> 22:24.000]  John had him on the line with me.
[22:24.000 --> 22:25.000]  He goes, I'm not coming on.
[22:25.000 --> 22:27.000]  And I go, listen, we're going to defeat globalism.
[22:27.000 --> 22:30.000]  He goes, you'll never beat us, you American.
[22:30.000 --> 22:34.000]  And I was like, oh, he goes, that's right.
[22:34.000 --> 22:35.000]  He'll never beat us.
[22:35.000 --> 22:39.000]  He actually talked like a demon.
[22:39.000 --> 22:41.000]  Bill Bow Baggins reaches for the ring and wore the rings.
[22:41.000 --> 22:42.000]  And he wants it away from frowning.
[22:42.000 --> 22:43.000]  He goes, it's mine.
[22:43.000 --> 22:44.000]  Give it to me.
[22:44.000 --> 22:46.000]  He goes, you'll never beat us, you Americans.
[22:46.000 --> 22:47.000]  And I was like, oh, you admit it.
[22:47.000 --> 22:48.000]  He goes, that's right.
[22:48.000 --> 22:51.000]  You'll never stop us, you Alex Jones.
[22:51.000 --> 22:54.000]  He was just, I said, come on, you're afraid to come on.
[22:54.000 --> 23:01.000]  He goes, hung the phone up, literally going, there, there, there.
[23:01.000 --> 23:02.000]  And now they're on TV.
[23:02.000 --> 23:03.000]  America was never great.
[23:03.000 --> 23:04.000]  I'll never be great.
[23:04.000 --> 23:07.000]  Oh, these Americans, they talk about America.
[23:07.000 --> 23:12.000]  They're proud of America.
[23:12.000 --> 23:14.000]  And then you got this right here.
[23:14.000 --> 23:15.000]  That's coming up.
[23:15.000 --> 23:20.000]  This, this Google info is like as big as the biggest thing ever that came out a month ago
[23:20.000 --> 23:23.000]  that we all forgot about already.
[23:23.000 --> 23:29.000]  Undercover videos, internal documents, pouring out, the damn breaking Google, fixing everything,
[23:29.000 --> 23:35.000]  planning to steal the election openly, red-handed the, the, the president of the whole operations
[23:35.000 --> 23:41.000]  for Google and their censorship, their new projects initiatives, the pre, the director,
[23:41.000 --> 23:47.000]  the El Presidente saying it on video, the money shot.
[23:47.000 --> 23:51.000]  Now another big executive comes out and says they're stealing everything.
[23:51.000 --> 23:55.000]  This time public, the damn broke.
[23:55.000 --> 23:59.000]  When the levy breaks, they have no place to stay.
[23:59.000 --> 24:04.000]  Going down, going down now, down to Chicago.
[24:04.000 --> 24:05.000]  I'm already digressing.
[24:05.000 --> 24:08.000]  I need to get to this next clip.
[24:08.000 --> 24:15.000]  But that's just, it's a, it's a frenzy of news and information here.
[24:15.000 --> 24:18.000]  All of it, more over the top than the last.
[24:18.000 --> 24:26.000]  National review, the never Trumpers, the neocons, the people that would control the conservative
[24:26.000 --> 24:30.000]  movement in America, the people that would shut me up or Matt Drudge up, not going to
[24:30.000 --> 24:32.000]  work or Trump up.
[24:32.000 --> 24:38.000]  National review helped Jeffrey Epstein rehab his image after child solicitation conviction.
[24:38.000 --> 24:40.000]  The slap on the wrist.
[24:40.000 --> 24:43.000]  What a group of dirty old men, man.
[24:43.000 --> 24:47.000]  They're afraid of full grown women.
[24:47.000 --> 24:53.000]  They want to creep around with your 12 year old daughter.
[24:53.000 --> 24:58.000]  Oh, speaking of creeping around, we had that creep on yesterday who was trolling everybody.
[24:58.000 --> 25:01.000]  It was a big joke and evidence is mounting that he, those weren't fake tweets.
[25:01.000 --> 25:04.000]  Those were his tweets and people are going to the way back machines.
[25:04.000 --> 25:05.000]  We got an investigation going.
[25:05.000 --> 25:06.000]  He came back on.
[25:06.000 --> 25:10.000]  Oh, and Troyer show by the time I'd learned more and I went after him.
[25:10.000 --> 25:11.000]  That's coming up.
[25:11.000 --> 25:14.000]  We're going to post the bull down to that info wars.com.
[25:14.000 --> 25:16.000]  And the next few hours we're going to play that here.
[25:16.000 --> 25:20.000]  It was just unbelievable.
[25:20.000 --> 25:25.000]  This is the guy that tries to organize 12 year old topless parties and bring your daughters
[25:25.000 --> 25:30.000]  to the community pool and then, but no parents allowed, bring your daughters topless to me
[25:30.000 --> 25:31.000]  and parents don't come around.
[25:31.000 --> 25:39.000]  That's 100% sexualization and a spider building a big web and saying flies come land here
[25:39.000 --> 25:42.000]  as it cleans its fangs.
[25:42.000 --> 25:47.000]  And I was trying to be somewhat nice to get him to admit more on air,
[25:47.000 --> 25:52.000]  but instead it was all a big PR stunt, a facelift operation.
[25:52.000 --> 25:58.000]  Well, if you think you were under investigation before, buddy boy.
[25:58.000 --> 26:00.000]  Mr. little man.
[26:00.000 --> 26:02.000]  Then you really are under investigation now.
[26:02.000 --> 26:12.000]  So you get ready info wars is going to be coming into your domain and it's sending out our little
[26:12.000 --> 26:16.000]  feelers and our little tentacles right now.
[26:16.000 --> 26:19.000]  And our tentacles have already found a lot of information.
[26:19.000 --> 26:22.000]  So you think you trolled us.
[26:22.000 --> 26:25.000]  Think again, fat boy.
[26:25.000 --> 26:29.000]  Now, let's get serious here.
[26:29.000 --> 26:32.000]  When I come back, I'll play the clip, the summation.
[26:32.000 --> 26:37.000]  That is one of the most powerful moments of the hearing with this ended 20 minutes ago.
[26:37.000 --> 26:43.000]  And then there's so much more that we're going to be getting into here on air.
[26:43.000 --> 26:54.000]  You realize in California, they say that I'll be arrested for calling that fat man with pink lipstick.
[26:54.000 --> 26:55.000]  A man.
[26:55.000 --> 26:56.000]  He is a man.
[26:56.000 --> 26:57.000]  He is a man.
[26:57.000 --> 26:58.000]  He is a man.
[26:58.000 --> 26:59.000]  And we all try to show that we're not hateful.
[26:59.000 --> 27:00.000]  Go.
[27:00.000 --> 27:01.000]  Okay, you're a woman.
[27:01.000 --> 27:06.000]  And it's like, okay, next, bring me your topless daughters and all over the country and all over
[27:06.000 --> 27:10.000]  Canada, kids don't come because it's all run by the same people and they ride horsey on men's
[27:10.000 --> 27:11.000]  genitals.
[27:11.000 --> 27:16.000]  Big fat men have kids riding them, riding, riding cowboy, hit them out, drive them in, move
[27:16.000 --> 27:17.000]  them out.
[27:17.000 --> 27:24.000]  Good, this ain't rowdy eights, ladies and gentlemen, and I was watching old rawhide episodes the
[27:24.000 --> 27:25.000]  other day.
[27:25.000 --> 27:27.000]  It's so good.
[27:27.000 --> 27:31.000]  So it's a man, baby.
[27:31.000 --> 27:33.000]  Dude, look like a lady.
[27:33.000 --> 27:35.000]  That's all coming up.
[27:35.000 --> 27:38.000]  Infidel defilers.
[27:38.000 --> 27:41.000]  They're all drowned in lakes of blood.
[27:41.000 --> 27:43.000]  It's not a threat to anybody.
[27:43.000 --> 27:45.000]  I'm like to quote Tulsa Doom.
[27:45.000 --> 27:50.000]  Some of that great riding by the great folks that wrote that.
[27:50.000 --> 27:53.000]  I got a chance to meet the guy that wrote that star.
[27:53.000 --> 27:55.000]  She's a very nice lady.
[27:55.000 --> 27:58.000]  But I'll leave it at that.
[27:58.000 --> 28:06.000]  A lot of stuff going on in DC.
[28:06.000 --> 28:15.000]  Millis and all our stone wrote that Conan the Barbarian is such a good movie.
[28:15.000 --> 28:18.000]  Conan the Destroyer is a terrible appalling movie.
[28:18.000 --> 28:22.000]  All right, I'm going to get refocused when we come back.
[28:22.000 --> 28:28.000]  And I'm thinking about real women versus fat men in pink bubblegum lipstick and the
[28:28.000 --> 28:30.000]  obscenity of it all.
[28:30.000 --> 28:32.000]  Bring me your children.
[28:32.000 --> 28:36.000]  Show me you're open and not hateful of me.
[28:36.000 --> 28:39.000]  While he rides around at Walmart in his little dart machine,
[28:39.000 --> 28:41.000]  he's too lazy to walk.
[28:41.000 --> 28:43.000]  It's all about selfishness.
[28:43.000 --> 28:45.000]  It's all about not respecting you and your children.
[28:45.000 --> 28:48.000]  It's all about usurping the power of women.
[28:48.000 --> 28:59.000]  My perverted sick men will be back with the destruction of Muller straight ahead.
[28:59.000 --> 29:02.000]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[29:02.000 --> 29:06.000]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels may not be fully
[29:06.000 --> 29:07.000]  detected by you.
[29:07.000 --> 29:09.000]  But the symptoms are there.
[29:09.000 --> 29:13.000]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular
[29:13.000 --> 29:17.000]  heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[29:17.000 --> 29:21.000]  Here how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's
[29:21.000 --> 29:23.000]  lives across America.
[29:23.000 --> 29:25.000]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[29:25.000 --> 29:27.000]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[29:27.000 --> 29:30.000]  I'm just telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how
[29:30.000 --> 29:31.000]  much healthier I feel.
[29:31.000 --> 29:33.000]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[29:33.000 --> 29:38.000]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product

[30:00.000 --> 30:04.000]  Serving with Info Wars is a great honor.
[30:04.000 --> 30:06.000]  But I still need my morning coffee.

[32:00.000 --> 32:02.000]  Robert Barnes, what has Big Tech become?
[32:02.000 --> 32:05.000]  Big Tech are big babies that have become big bullies and the way they did so
[32:05.000 --> 32:09.000]  is because they face no consequence of social, economic, political or legal
[32:09.000 --> 32:11.000]  for their illicit activities over two decades.
[32:11.000 --> 32:14.000]  And because of that, that's why the courts, the judges, the juries,
[32:14.000 --> 32:16.000]  the members of the independent free press that care about this,
[32:16.000 --> 32:19.000]  the ordinary members of the public and the audience that care about this
[32:19.000 --> 32:23.000]  have to bring real social, political, economic consequence to their course of conduct
[32:23.000 --> 32:26.000]  otherwise they will never change and they will become the big tech oligarchs
[32:26.000 --> 32:29.000]  the equivalent to the big trust of the 19th century who ran American politics
[32:29.000 --> 32:32.000]  and ran American economy almost into the ground
[32:32.000 --> 32:34.000]  until we were able to recover after the Great Depression.
[32:34.000 --> 32:39.000]  The InfoWars audience is the fuel that flames the light of liberty across the world
[32:39.000 --> 32:42.000]  to make real the actions of independent free speech
[32:42.000 --> 32:45.000]  to make real the original promise of an independent free press
[32:45.000 --> 32:49.000]  real collusion is big tech and big media manipulating and working with each other
[32:49.000 --> 32:52.000]  to try to meddle with elections, to try to shake people's thoughts
[32:52.000 --> 32:54.000]  and then the whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening
[32:54.000 --> 32:56.000]  it's the ultimate form of gaslighting
[32:56.000 --> 32:58.000]  what you just saw isn't what you just saw
[32:58.000 --> 33:10.000]  even it is what we just saw
[33:28.000 --> 33:31.000]  I chose to pull the shortest straw
[33:31.000 --> 33:33.000]  I chose to make history
[33:33.000 --> 33:37.000]  I chose to be demonized and probably destroyed in my time
[33:37.000 --> 33:40.000]  but to change the world in the future for the better
[33:40.000 --> 33:42.000]  that's called leadership
[33:42.000 --> 33:45.000]  and you can make no mistake that Donald John Trump
[33:45.000 --> 33:48.000]  is trying to execute that same operation
[33:48.000 --> 33:51.000]  and that's why he's so hated he's certainly not perfect
[33:51.000 --> 33:54.000]  but almost every attack leveled on him
[33:54.000 --> 33:58.000]  every false charge levied against him is patently false
[33:58.000 --> 34:01.000]  so when the mainstream media is up there telling you that
[34:01.000 --> 34:04.000]  Trump's the biggest liar the planet ever saw
[34:04.000 --> 34:06.000]  and oh look we got a hundred containers of gumballs here
[34:06.000 --> 34:08.000]  each gumball is a lie
[34:08.000 --> 34:10.000]  it's all theater and stunts
[34:10.000 --> 34:12.000]  and look I know you know that
[34:12.000 --> 34:16.000]  but weak-minded people buy into it
[34:16.000 --> 34:19.000]  and that's why they're so crazed because they believe a literal Hitler
[34:19.000 --> 34:23.000]  that has put children in cages and is killing them
[34:23.000 --> 34:27.000]  and making people drink out of toilets is in charge
[34:27.000 --> 34:30.000]  and every day, every minute they're told it's an affront
[34:30.000 --> 34:33.000]  and they're told that this guy's bad and his supporters are bad
[34:33.000 --> 34:35.000]  and his supporters have got to be crushed
[34:35.000 --> 34:37.000]  they've got to be destroyed
[34:37.000 --> 34:39.000]  they've got to be hit in the head with steel pipes
[34:39.000 --> 34:42.000]  they've got to be shot at, they've got to be firebombed
[34:42.000 --> 34:44.000]  coming up next hour after going to these clips
[34:44.000 --> 34:48.000]  Ted Cruz urges FBI to open a RICO investigation into Antifa
[34:48.000 --> 34:50.000]  Hallelujah
[34:50.000 --> 34:52.000]  Hallelujah for that
[34:52.000 --> 34:55.000]  by the way, something on Ted Cruz that I want to get to later
[34:55.000 --> 34:57.000]  maybe a message to Ted Cruz
[34:57.000 --> 35:01.000]  because I ran into him and I didn't know that last time I was in DC
[35:01.000 --> 35:03.000]  well for the inauguration last time I was there
[35:03.000 --> 35:10.000]  I didn't know that I was literally, the condo I rented was next door to him
[35:10.000 --> 35:13.000]  so we come out and out of the dark
[35:13.000 --> 35:16.000]  because the light was off at the end of the hall
[35:16.000 --> 35:19.000]  where our condos were at the end of the building
[35:19.000 --> 35:23.000]  because we both had, I guess, corner three-bedroom condos
[35:23.000 --> 35:26.000]  because I had my security people and stuff in there
[35:26.000 --> 35:29.000]  and out of the dark comes Ted Cruz looking like Count Dracula
[35:29.000 --> 35:31.000]  that's his nickname, but he literally glides out of the dark
[35:31.000 --> 35:33.000]  and goes, Alex Jones, and I shot video of it
[35:33.000 --> 35:37.000]  and people have seen it and we had to talk, and we talked off air as well
[35:37.000 --> 35:40.000]  and basically talked about burying the hatchet
[35:40.000 --> 35:44.000]  and then I'm always saying I'm going to send this message to Ted Cruz
[35:44.000 --> 35:48.000]  but then I never get to it here on air
[35:48.000 --> 35:53.000]  so maybe later in the third hour if you guys remind me
[35:53.000 --> 35:55.000]  we'll get that footage when I talk to Ted Cruz
[35:55.000 --> 36:02.000]  and then we'll talk about the fact that he told the Washington Post
[36:02.000 --> 36:09.000]  that, you know, I'm this terrible person
[36:09.000 --> 36:11.000]  but I still deserve my free speech
[36:11.000 --> 36:13.000]  because I said his dad killed Kennedy
[36:13.000 --> 36:16.000]  I didn't say your dad killed Kennedy
[36:16.000 --> 36:21.000]  I said your dad clearly worked for the CIA
[36:21.000 --> 36:25.000]  and lived in the area when it happened
[36:25.000 --> 36:28.000]  and was connected to the anti-communist groups
[36:28.000 --> 36:32.000]  and Trump talked about that, that's Roger Stone said that
[36:32.000 --> 36:35.000]  and then Trump, I covered it
[36:35.000 --> 36:38.000]  but see, oh, Alex Jones lied about my dad
[36:38.000 --> 36:44.000]  my dad almost sued him
[36:44.000 --> 36:47.000]  and then it's not true
[36:47.000 --> 36:49.000]  so I said I'd get to these clips
[36:49.000 --> 36:53.000]  but I'm all over the map today as you can see
[36:53.000 --> 36:58.000]  let's go ahead and get to the opening
[36:58.000 --> 37:03.000]  of the beginning of the Civil War
[37:03.000 --> 37:07.000]  that we're seeing unfold inside the Justice Department
[37:07.000 --> 37:09.000]  and inside DC
[37:09.000 --> 37:11.000]  because the fact that they're not stopping
[37:11.000 --> 37:15.000]  when the investigation is the crime
[37:15.000 --> 37:19.000]  and are going ahead against Trump
[37:19.000 --> 37:21.000]  shows that Trump and others will go ahead
[37:21.000 --> 37:23.000]  and take the gloves off which is already happening
[37:23.000 --> 37:25.000]  and a bunch of their people are going to get indicted
[37:25.000 --> 37:27.000]  so that means the Democrats are going to war
[37:27.000 --> 37:29.000]  at an even greater level
[37:29.000 --> 37:33.000]  and that means historically they're going to try to assassinate the president
[37:33.000 --> 37:37.000]  so here's Representative Mike Johnson, the Republican
[37:37.000 --> 37:42.000]  closing out the Mueller culmination
[37:42.000 --> 37:45.000]  of the witch hunt hearings today
[37:45.000 --> 37:47.000]  as the closer for the Republican side
[37:47.000 --> 37:49.000]  I know you're glad to get to the close
[37:49.000 --> 37:51.000]  I want to summarize the highlights of what we have heard
[37:51.000 --> 37:53.000]  and what we know
[37:53.000 --> 37:56.000]  you spent two years and nearly 30 million taxpayer dollars
[37:56.000 --> 37:59.000]  and unlimited resources to prepare a nearly 450 page report
[37:59.000 --> 38:02.000]  which you described today as very thorough
[38:02.000 --> 38:04.000]  millions of Americans today
[38:04.000 --> 38:06.000]  maintain genuine concerns about your work
[38:06.000 --> 38:08.000]  in large part because of the infamous
[38:08.000 --> 38:10.000]  and widely publicized bias
[38:10.000 --> 38:12.000]  of your investigating team members
[38:12.000 --> 38:14.000]  which we now know included 14 Democrats
[38:14.000 --> 38:16.000]  and zero Republicans
[38:16.000 --> 38:18.000]  campaign finance reports later showed that team
[38:18.000 --> 38:20.000]  excuse me, it's my time
[38:20.000 --> 38:22.000]  that team of Democrat investigators you hired
[38:22.000 --> 38:25.000]  donated more than $60,000 to the Hillary Clinton campaign
[38:25.000 --> 38:27.000]  and other Democratic candidates
[38:27.000 --> 38:29.000]  your team also included Peter Struck and Lisa Page
[38:29.000 --> 38:31.000]  which have been discussed today
[38:31.000 --> 38:33.000]  and they had the lurid text messages
[38:33.000 --> 38:36.000]  that confirm they openly mocked and hated Donald Trump
[38:36.000 --> 38:39.000]  and his supporters and they vowed to take him out
[38:39.000 --> 38:42.000]  Mr. Ratcliffe asked you earlier this morning
[38:42.000 --> 38:44.000]  can you give me an example other than Donald Trump
[38:44.000 --> 38:46.000]  where the Justice Department determined
[38:46.000 --> 38:48.000]  that an investigative person was not exonerated
[38:48.000 --> 38:51.000]  because their innocence was not conclusively determined
[38:51.000 --> 38:54.000]  you answered I cannot
[38:54.000 --> 38:56.000]  sir that is unprecedented
[38:56.000 --> 38:58.000]  the president believed from the very beginning
[38:58.000 --> 39:01.000]  that you and your special counsel team had serious conflicts
[39:01.000 --> 39:03.000]  as stated in the report and acknowledged by everybody
[39:03.000 --> 39:05.000]  and yet President Trump
[39:05.000 --> 39:07.000]  cooperated fully with the investigation
[39:07.000 --> 39:09.000]  he knew he had done nothing wrong
[39:09.000 --> 39:11.000]  and he encouraged all witnesses to cooperate
[39:11.000 --> 39:13.000]  with the investigation and produced
[39:13.000 --> 39:15.000]  more than 1.4 million pages of information
[39:15.000 --> 39:17.000]  and allowed over 40 witnesses
[39:17.000 --> 39:19.000]  who were directly affiliated with the White House
[39:19.000 --> 39:21.000]  or his campaign
[39:21.000 --> 39:23.000]  please back that up 20 seconds
[39:25.000 --> 39:27.000]  think about this this is all true
[39:27.000 --> 39:29.000]  Trump gave over
[39:29.000 --> 39:31.000]  unprecedented emails
[39:31.000 --> 39:33.000]  all of the campaign
[39:33.000 --> 39:35.000]  emails
[39:35.000 --> 39:37.000]  not just emails that they
[39:37.000 --> 39:39.000]  corresponded with people
[39:39.000 --> 39:41.000]  he gave them all millions
[39:41.000 --> 39:43.000]  I forget the number like 30 million
[39:43.000 --> 39:45.000]  to be datamined
[39:45.000 --> 39:47.000]  to be put into democrat databases all this
[39:47.000 --> 39:49.000]  but okay the media said
[39:49.000 --> 39:51.000]  if you don't give us everything you're hiding it
[39:53.000 --> 39:55.000]  and then they would have stuff in the news like
[39:55.000 --> 39:57.000]  that
[39:57.000 --> 39:59.000]  WikiLeaks sent the code keys
[39:59.000 --> 40:01.000]  to Donald Trump Jr.
[40:01.000 --> 40:03.000]  before WikiLeaks and you get the date
[40:03.000 --> 40:05.000]  it's a month after
[40:05.000 --> 40:07.000]  everybody got those WikiLeaks emails
[40:07.000 --> 40:09.000]  because they would send the email out
[40:09.000 --> 40:11.000]  everyone would forward it with the code key
[40:11.000 --> 40:13.000]  to go and
[40:13.000 --> 40:15.000]  get the information
[40:15.000 --> 40:17.000]  off of their server
[40:17.000 --> 40:19.000]  but the media knew it was a month after
[40:19.000 --> 40:21.000]  that email had been sent out
[40:21.000 --> 40:23.000]  and they knew it had been sent to
[40:23.000 --> 40:25.000]  Don Jr. and that Don Jr. hadn't even
[40:25.000 --> 40:27.000]  opened it
[40:27.000 --> 40:29.000]  that's just one little microcosm
[40:29.000 --> 40:31.000]  one little factoid it's like
[40:31.000 --> 40:33.000]  as soon as I get sued for Sandy Hook
[40:33.000 --> 40:35.000]  I get sent
[40:35.000 --> 40:37.000]  Sandy Hook articles with
[40:37.000 --> 40:39.000]  hidden embedded code
[40:39.000 --> 40:41.000]  the code makes the child porn
[40:41.000 --> 40:43.000]  then the democrats that work for Hillary
[40:43.000 --> 40:45.000]  sued me
[40:45.000 --> 40:47.000]  in discovery demand any email
[40:47.000 --> 40:49.000]  that has the name Sandy Hook in it
[40:49.000 --> 40:51.000]  and then computers scan it
[40:51.000 --> 40:53.000]  and find the hidden child porn
[40:55.000 --> 40:57.000]  and then we start getting
[40:57.000 --> 40:59.000]  calls from the media
[40:59.000 --> 41:01.000]  oh it was being leaked it was being prepared
[41:01.000 --> 41:03.000]  that's why I exposed it and the national media
[41:03.000 --> 41:05.000]  ran the headline
[41:05.000 --> 41:07.000]  Alex Jones sent child porn to Sandy Hook families
[41:07.000 --> 41:09.000]  well guess what it blew up in your face
[41:09.000 --> 41:11.000]  it failed our support exploded
[41:11.000 --> 41:13.000]  after that
[41:13.000 --> 41:15.000]  because people understand who
[41:15.000 --> 41:17.000]  the democrats are and they know what
[41:17.000 --> 41:19.000]  they're up to and a lot of democrats
[41:19.000 --> 41:21.000]  who aren't as evil
[41:21.000 --> 41:23.000]  as the people running the party have told me
[41:23.000 --> 41:25.000]  publicly and privately that they are leaving
[41:25.000 --> 41:27.000]  the party because of what they've seen done to
[41:27.000 --> 41:29.000]  Trump and done to me and done to countless others
[41:29.000 --> 41:31.000]  because they understand that it is a criminal mafia
[41:31.000 --> 41:33.000]  let's go back to the congressman
[41:37.000 --> 41:39.000]  special counsel team had serious conflicts
[41:39.000 --> 41:41.000]  this is stated in the report and acknowledged by everybody
[41:41.000 --> 41:43.000]  and yet President Trump
[41:43.000 --> 41:45.000]  cooperated fully with the investigation
[41:45.000 --> 41:47.000]  he knew he had done nothing wrong
[41:47.000 --> 41:49.000]  he encouraged all witnesses to cooperate
[41:49.000 --> 41:51.000]  with the investigation and produced more than
[41:51.000 --> 41:53.000]  1.4 million pages of information
[41:53.000 --> 41:55.000]  and allowed over 40 witnesses
[41:55.000 --> 41:57.000]  who were directly affiliated with the White House
[41:57.000 --> 41:59.000]  or his campaign
[41:59.000 --> 42:01.000]  your report acknowledges on page 61 volume 2
[42:01.000 --> 42:03.000]  that a volume of evidence exists
[42:03.000 --> 42:05.000]  of the president telling many people
[42:05.000 --> 42:07.000]  privately quote
[42:07.000 --> 42:09.000]  the president was concerned about the impact of the Russian
[42:09.000 --> 42:11.000]  investigation on his ability to govern
[42:11.000 --> 42:13.000]  and to address important foreign relations
[42:13.000 --> 42:15.000]  issues and even matters of national security
[42:15.000 --> 42:17.000]  and on page 174 volume 2
[42:17.000 --> 42:19.000]  your report also acknowledges
[42:19.000 --> 42:21.000]  that the Supreme Court has held quote
[42:21.000 --> 42:23.000]  the president's removal powers
[42:23.000 --> 42:25.000]  are at their zenith with respect to
[42:25.000 --> 42:27.000]  principal officers that is
[42:27.000 --> 42:29.000]  officers who must be appointed by the president
[42:29.000 --> 42:31.000]  and who report to him directly
[42:31.000 --> 42:33.000]  the president's exclusive and illimitable power
[42:33.000 --> 42:35.000]  of removal of those principal officers
[42:35.000 --> 42:37.000]  furthers the president's ability to ensure
[42:37.000 --> 42:39.000]  that the laws are faithfully executed
[42:39.000 --> 42:41.000]  and that would even include the attorney general
[42:41.000 --> 42:43.000]  look in spite of all of that
[42:43.000 --> 42:45.000]  nothing ever happened to stop
[42:45.000 --> 42:47.000]  or impede your special counsel's investigation
[42:47.000 --> 42:49.000]  nobody was fired by the president
[42:49.000 --> 42:51.000]  nothing was curtailed and the investigation
[42:51.000 --> 42:53.000]  continued unencumbered
[42:53.000 --> 42:55.000]  that's right we'll be right back stay with us
[42:55.000 --> 42:57.000]  the investigation is the crime
[42:57.000 --> 42:59.000]  they all committed crimes they all need to go to jail
[42:59.000 --> 43:01.000]  before I started working at info wars
[43:01.000 --> 43:03.000]  I was not only a fan
[43:03.000 --> 43:05.000]  of alex jones and info wars dot com
[43:05.000 --> 43:07.000]  but also the products at info wars store
[43:07.000 --> 43:09.000]  dot com and there's one product
[43:09.000 --> 43:11.000]  that's offered at info wars store dot com
[43:11.000 --> 43:13.000]  the elite of the supplements
[43:13.000 --> 43:15.000]  and that's dna force plus
[43:15.000 --> 43:17.000]  now I remember when alex first started talking about this
[43:17.000 --> 43:19.000]  with some of his special guests
[43:19.000 --> 43:21.000]  telomeres and telomere support
[43:21.000 --> 43:23.000]  with your dna
[43:23.000 --> 43:25.000]  so I started to look into the science and what telomeres were
[43:25.000 --> 43:27.000]  and how it can improve
[43:27.000 --> 43:29.000]  your health and longevity
[43:29.000 --> 43:31.000]  when you protect your telomere
[43:31.000 --> 43:33.000]  so I started looking into dna force plus
[43:33.000 --> 43:35.000]  but it's expensive why
[43:35.000 --> 43:37.000]  because it is an elite supplement
[43:37.000 --> 43:39.000]  and then I started seeing other competitors
[43:39.000 --> 43:41.000]  coming up with competitive supplements
[43:41.000 --> 43:43.000]  for telomere support
[43:43.000 --> 43:45.000]  and they came and they went
[43:45.000 --> 43:47.000]  but dna force plus is still
[43:47.000 --> 43:49.000]  there it is the elite supplement
[43:49.000 --> 43:51.000]  I get excited when dna force plus
[43:51.000 --> 43:53.000]  is on sale because I know it's expensive
[43:53.000 --> 43:55.000]  so you should take advantage of
[43:55.000 --> 43:57.000]  50% off dna force plus
[43:57.000 --> 43:59.000]  at info wars store dot com
[43:59.000 --> 44:01.000]  talik yes I got a plug
[44:01.000 --> 44:03.000]  for the patriot points I get
[44:03.000 --> 44:05.000]  I got 180 dollars so far this year
[44:05.000 --> 44:07.000]  and I feel like I'm stealing from you
[44:07.000 --> 44:09.000]  so much in the store because I mean
[44:09.000 --> 44:11.000]  I don't want to give that money to walmart
[44:11.000 --> 44:13.000]  I don't want to give that money to people who are going to donate it to causes I don't believe in
[44:13.000 --> 44:15.000]  so I'd rather give that money to you
[44:15.000 --> 44:17.000]  and I'm getting quality products the products that I do
[44:17.000 --> 44:19.000]  receive have changed my life
[44:19.000 --> 44:21.000]  I mean the x2 has really done a lot for me
[44:21.000 --> 44:23.000]  I've lost weight my brain works a whole lot better
[44:23.000 --> 44:25.000]  my kids they use the toothpaste
[44:25.000 --> 44:27.000]  my son used to get these little sore throats
[44:27.000 --> 44:29.000]  and he puts x2 in water and drinks it
[44:29.000 --> 44:31.000]  and it gets rid of his sore throat
[44:31.000 --> 44:33.000]  well sir let me break this down for you
[44:33.000 --> 44:35.000]  I want high quality stuff in there
[44:35.000 --> 44:37.000]  I kind of habituated everybody

[44:39.000 --> 44:41.000]  I'm making $2 on the toothpaste 50% off

[44:43.000 --> 44:45.000]  or the turmeric or the bone broth
[44:45.000 --> 44:47.000]  thank you so much for the plugs but listen
[44:47.000 --> 44:49.000]  when people get the patriot points
[44:49.000 --> 44:51.000]  a lot of times it makes things a loss later
[44:51.000 --> 44:53.000]  because if you're already getting 10% off because you're on auto ship
[44:53.000 --> 44:55.000]  then we're doing 50% off
[44:55.000 --> 44:57.000]  and then you do something like that
[44:57.000 --> 44:59.000]  where you have patriot points we lose money but that's okay

[47:03.240 --> 47:06.280]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:11.880 --> 47:14.880]  Welcome back. I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[47:14.880 --> 47:19.880]  Well, I tell you, the bullet hit the bone today.
[47:19.880 --> 47:22.380]  Welcome back. I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[47:22.380 --> 47:28.380]  Well, I tell you, the bullet hit the bone today.
[47:28.380 --> 47:35.380]  Woo! I won't get up on air and say the Democrats are bleeding the death politically and I don't see it happening.
[47:35.380 --> 47:39.380]  I don't do the type of stuff they do where they just hype things up and hope they come true.
[47:39.380 --> 47:44.380]  Oh, and I, when I see blood and I smell blood, it's amazing.
[47:44.380 --> 47:49.380]  I mean, there's blood on the streets. It's up to my ankles to quote Jim Morrison.
[47:49.380 --> 47:54.380]  There's blood on the street. It's up to my ankles.
[47:54.380 --> 47:58.380]  These people have gone so far. They've committed such massive crimes.
[47:58.380 --> 48:00.380]  And that's why I'm particularly irritated today.
[48:00.380 --> 48:06.380]  When I got into the office, I've been watching the hearing since it started while I was working out this morning.
[48:06.380 --> 48:13.380]  And before that, when I was having a little breakfast with my children with all four of my children,
[48:13.380 --> 48:16.380]  media says I don't have custody of my children. I have full custody.
[48:16.380 --> 48:21.380]  I just wore hoaxes. That's why I'll be out on the street and I'll have to walk by and go after your family
[48:21.380 --> 48:26.380]  because they'll see all my kids and my kids all look great and I'm happy and my great-looking wife and everything.
[48:26.380 --> 48:32.380]  And they just go, what? After your family? What a grip of trash you are.
[48:32.380 --> 48:38.380]  But anyways, the reason it gives me a headache is I was watching the testimony and I've got this clip.
[48:38.380 --> 48:41.380]  It was like 9.30 or so. I saw it.
[48:41.380 --> 48:46.380]  I'm going through all these clips trying to find the spot.
[48:46.380 --> 48:50.380]  I think it was when he was talking to bigs, Congressman Biggs.
[48:50.380 --> 49:01.380]  And Mueller says he doesn't remember meeting with Rosenstein and Attorney General at the time, Jeff Sessions.
[49:01.380 --> 49:05.380]  And he's obviously lying. It's the worst lying. His hands are shaking.
[49:05.380 --> 49:14.380]  This was the day that Comey got fired.
[49:14.380 --> 49:20.380]  And Mueller wanted the job. It's all about the power structure.
[49:20.380 --> 49:26.380]  Being in charge of the Justice Department so they can run the drugs and the cocaine and do whatever they want.
[49:26.380 --> 49:31.380]  And of course they know what Trump, it's not business as usual. The U.S. government's not going to traffic in narcotics.
[49:31.380 --> 49:38.380]  That's another reason they're so pissed and all God's children in MS-13 and all of this, they don't know what to do.
[49:38.380 --> 49:42.380]  Because since the poppy bush days, they're shipping the drugs in.
[49:42.380 --> 49:47.380]  There's a new sheriff in town. This can't be allowed.
[49:47.380 --> 49:53.380]  And so remember, Comey told Trump, you're not under criminal investigation.
[49:53.380 --> 50:03.380]  Of course, now we know they were running an illegal, secret criminal investigation of Trump and his associates, including yours truly.
[50:03.380 --> 50:09.380]  And they use that investigation as the fake reason to say, take his bank ratings away. Take his websites away.
[50:09.380 --> 50:15.380]  Kick him off this. He's a Russian. He'll be arrested. Trump will be arrested.
[50:15.380 --> 50:23.380]  And they use this giant bluff to almost overthrow Trump in this country.
[50:23.380 --> 50:29.380]  And that's why I'm so upset. But we got to find that clip.
[50:29.380 --> 50:34.380]  Because I was sitting there watching it and I was finishing my workout and it was so powerful.
[50:34.380 --> 50:39.380]  Mueller was asked, do you remember this meeting that day? Remember that meeting?
[50:39.380 --> 50:44.380]  Because they're all signed in meetings that are on record. Of course he remembers meeting and trying to get the job.
[50:44.380 --> 50:53.380]  Of course he remembers meeting and scheming with Rosenstein and with the attorney general the day of and the day after when they decided to launch.
[50:53.380 --> 50:59.380]  The special counsel, because they didn't keep the old deep state in. Trump was kicking the deep state out.
[50:59.380 --> 51:12.380]  They got dirt on sessions. Rosenstein, they told sessions, we're going to show you in that KKK outfit, buddy, 45 years ago, if you don't get down there and polish it.
[51:12.380 --> 51:18.380]  Now get on your knees, zip. It's not about sex, Gary.
[51:18.380 --> 51:25.380]  I don't mean to be graphic, but that's how it works with these bum lawyers all arrogant up their perks like a bunch of vultures.
[51:25.380 --> 51:31.380]  Hoping America can be sold off and cut up. That's all they are is a bunch of corporate raiders.
[51:31.380 --> 51:38.380]  They're a bunch of trash, a bunch of sellouts. And now they don't know what to do anymore.
[51:38.380 --> 51:44.380]  Because everybody's been threatened into going along with them so far believing they would get back in power.
[51:44.380 --> 51:50.380]  Well, guess what? You're not getting back in power. We've just begun to dig your ass out.
[51:50.380 --> 51:57.380]  I'm winning. Trump's winning. America's winning. You're losing. You're the losers.
[51:57.380 --> 52:10.380]  It's emblematic that all their leaders, Mueller and Hillary and people like the presumptive Democrat candidate Joe Biden can hardly talk.
[52:10.380 --> 52:18.380]  Their hands are shaking. They don't know what planet they're on because they're scared and they're cornered and they know there's criminal investigations.
[52:18.380 --> 52:36.380]  And they know the fires of hell are lapping up at them like they're on a rotisserie spit. And they look over and I and Trump, the American people and all of us are just slow basting them.
[52:36.380 --> 52:55.380]  Put a little butter on top. Put some pepper on there. Maybe a little. A little garlic. We know how much Hillary likes garlic.
[52:55.380 --> 53:06.380]  The best laid plans of mice and men often go astray as von Bismarck once said, God loves children, drunks, the United States of America.
[53:06.380 --> 53:17.380]  And they all thought America was down for the count. And now they're all showing us who they are and what they stand for.
[53:17.380 --> 53:29.380]  And they are imploding.
[53:29.380 --> 53:35.380]  Let's go ahead. They found the big clip and I'm going to go back to Representative Mike Johnson and when he was closing it out.
[53:35.380 --> 53:50.380]  Here is Mueller clearly perjuring himself unless he's got full on Alzheimer's, which I could kind of believe he had to have the never Trump or lawyer that Trump hates so much sitting there telling him what to say.
[53:50.380 --> 53:52.380]  Here it is.
[53:52.380 --> 54:05.380]  Mr. Mueller, evidence suggests that on May 10th, 2017 at approximately 745 a.m. six days before the DAG, so Deputy Attorney General appointed you special counsel, Mr. Rosenstein called you and mentioned the appointment of a special counsel.
[54:05.380 --> 54:11.380]  Not necessarily that you'd be appointed, but that you had a discussion of that. Is that true?
[54:11.380 --> 54:13.380]  May 10th, 2017.
[54:13.380 --> 54:19.380]  I don't have any knowledge of that occurring.
[54:19.380 --> 54:22.380]  I don't have any knowledge or you don't recall.
[54:22.380 --> 54:25.380]  I don't have any knowledge.
[54:25.380 --> 54:26.380]  Evidence also just.
[54:26.380 --> 54:30.380]  I mean, we've given that what I saw you do. Are you questioning that?
[54:30.380 --> 54:36.380]  Well, I just find it intriguing. Let me just tell you that there's evidence that suggests that that phone call took place and that that's what was said.
[54:36.380 --> 54:44.380]  So let's move to the next question. Evidence suggests that also on May 12th, 2017, five days before the DAG appointed you special counsel, you met with Mr. Rosenstein in person.
[54:44.380 --> 54:49.380]  Did you discuss the appointment of special counsel then? Not necessarily that you, but that there would be a special counsel.
[54:49.380 --> 54:56.380]  I've gone into waters that don't allow me to give you an answer to that particular question.
[54:56.380 --> 55:01.380]  It relates to the internal discussions he would have in terms of indicting an individual.
[55:01.380 --> 55:06.380]  It has nothing to do with indictment. It has to do with special counsel and whether you discussed that with Mr. Rosenstein.
[55:06.380 --> 55:11.380]  Evidence also suggests on May 13th, four days before you were appointed special counsel.
[55:11.380 --> 55:19.380]  You met with Attorney, former Attorney General Sessions and Rosenstein and you spoke about special counsel. Do you remember that?
[55:19.380 --> 55:21.380]  Not a fan, no.
[55:21.380 --> 55:30.380]  Okay. And on May 16th, the day before you were appointed special counsel, you met with the president and Rod Rosenstein. Do you remember having that meeting?
[55:30.380 --> 55:31.380]  Yes.
[55:31.380 --> 55:35.380]  And discussion of the position of the FBI director took place. Do you remember that?
[55:35.380 --> 55:36.380]  Yes.
[55:36.380 --> 55:42.380]  And did you discuss at any time in that meeting Mr. Comey's termination?
[55:42.380 --> 55:43.380]  No.
[55:43.380 --> 55:51.380]  Did you discuss at any time in that meeting the potential appointment of a special counsel? Not necessarily you, but just in general terms.
[55:51.380 --> 55:53.380]  I can't get into the discussions on that.
[55:53.380 --> 56:00.380]  How many times did you speak to Mr. Rosenstein before May 17th, which is the day you got appointed regarding the appointment of special counsel?
[56:00.380 --> 56:03.380]  How many times prior to that did you discuss?
[56:03.380 --> 56:04.380]  How many times?
[56:04.380 --> 56:07.380]  Do you discuss because you don't recall or are you just...
[56:07.380 --> 56:08.380]  I do not recall.
[56:08.380 --> 56:12.380]  Okay. Thank you.
[56:12.380 --> 56:18.380]  How many times did you speak with Mr. Comey about any investigations pertaining to Russier prior to May 17th, 2017?
[56:18.380 --> 56:19.380]  Zero.
[56:19.380 --> 56:20.380]  Zero?
[56:20.380 --> 56:21.380]  Zero.
[56:21.380 --> 56:22.380]  Okay.
[56:22.380 --> 56:25.380]  That's all perjury, folks.
[56:25.380 --> 56:34.380]  And again, you think he's meeting all these times in the days leading up to this with the attorney general and people about the fact that Trump's getting ready to fire Comey and can he be put in?
[56:34.380 --> 56:35.380]  And that's even come out.
[56:35.380 --> 56:36.380]  Those meetings happen.
[56:36.380 --> 56:53.380]  He's saying, I have no memory of those meetings because that's where they hatched the plot to take their secret illegal investigations already getting millions of dollars of FBI money paid to their families to go around the Internet and cook up BS.
[56:53.380 --> 57:03.380]  So their lazy, stupid husbands and wives could get half a million dollars, a million dollars a piece to just come up with BS.
[57:03.380 --> 57:04.380]  That's what these criminals are up to.
[57:04.380 --> 57:05.380]  It's amazing.
[57:05.380 --> 57:07.380]  We're going to go to break.
[57:07.380 --> 57:08.380]  He was doddering.
[57:08.380 --> 57:11.380]  He looks like he's had a frontal lobotomy.
[57:11.380 --> 57:13.380]  He's emblematic of the collapsing state.
[57:13.380 --> 57:17.380]  And there's a funny Jack Pesobic tweet.
[57:17.380 --> 57:19.380]  Imagine if Mueller took brain force.
[57:19.380 --> 57:20.380]  That's right.

[58:40.540 --> 58:50.940]  Head to InfowarsStore.com today.
[58:50.940 --> 58:54.860]  I talk about this on the air and I know it sinks into people, but I've decided that
[58:54.860 --> 58:58.580]  we're going to kind of reboot all our supplements and that if you go back five, six years ago
[58:58.580 --> 59:01.740]  before all the censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits and the rest of it, I would
[59:01.740 --> 59:05.140]  talk about how great the products are and how they were the best and why they were and
[59:05.140 --> 59:07.740]  I'd have doctors on an expert to explain why they were so good.
[59:07.740 --> 59:11.020]  And instead the last few years, I'm like, hey, we need to really support us or they'll
[59:11.020 --> 59:12.020]  shut us down.
[59:12.020 --> 59:14.420]  The biggest thing people like to buy is supplements because they know how great they are and how
[59:14.420 --> 59:15.420]  wonderful they were.
[59:15.420 --> 59:17.260]  And the left always has headlines everywhere.
[59:17.260 --> 59:21.460]  Jones sells unapproved supplements that he claims are supplements.
[59:21.460 --> 59:26.940]  No, under federal law since 1996, you can't say that a supplement has been through the
[59:26.940 --> 59:29.420]  FDA because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it.
[59:29.420 --> 59:33.340]  But then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them and all drugs are is the
[59:33.340 --> 59:36.940]  system trying to tweak what's in mother nature and manipulate it and do different things.
[59:36.940 --> 59:38.260]  And a lot of drugs work great.
[59:38.260 --> 59:42.220]  They have side effects, not with mother nature, but Big Pharma doesn't want you knowing about
[59:42.220 --> 59:44.100]  God's medicine chest.
[59:44.100 --> 01:00:10.900]  All right, that's all for the video I'll see you ready for this.
[01:00:10.900 --> 01:00:38.520]  I want to get to more of it, I've already played some clips, I also want to open the
[01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:43.540]  phones up at the bottom of the hour to get your take on what you thought of the hearing
[01:00:43.540 --> 01:00:44.940]  if you watched it.
[01:00:44.940 --> 01:00:51.580]  But quite frankly, it's very important because it derails their next plan to remove the president.
[01:00:51.580 --> 01:00:53.900]  But the fact that they're still pushing it means the president's going to really put
[01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:57.380]  his claws into them, which is the right thing to do anyways, that's what I've told the president
[01:00:57.380 --> 01:01:00.340]  all along, is it's never going to stop, they can't help themselves, they're not going to
[01:01:00.340 --> 01:01:05.260]  make a deal, they're not going to get sent to the Alba, like Napoleon got sent away,
[01:01:05.260 --> 01:01:06.740]  they're not giving up ever.
[01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:11.140]  So you might as well just not let them have a chance at your throat, Mr. President, you
[01:01:11.140 --> 01:01:14.260]  need to go after them for all their criminal activity now.
[01:01:14.260 --> 01:01:18.420]  And the president's going to do that now.
[01:01:18.420 --> 01:01:20.620]  So the system is not happy.
[01:01:20.620 --> 01:01:24.380]  And by the way, I'm not bragging about that, but every time I've talked to Trump, he's
[01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:28.060]  telling me, oh, you know, appreciate you keep working hard, great job, man, I see your fans
[01:01:28.060 --> 01:01:32.100]  everywhere, you know, you're the next fresh limba, I'm like, Mr. President, let's cut
[01:01:32.100 --> 01:01:33.780]  away from all that, sir, you're too important.
[01:01:33.780 --> 01:01:35.020]  Well, I am very busy.
[01:01:35.020 --> 01:01:39.620]  Yes, well, I just talked to this world leader, I understand, sir, they're going to kill you
[01:01:39.620 --> 01:01:42.500]  if you don't stop them politically, they're never going to stop.
[01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:44.580]  They have little dick syndrome.
[01:01:44.580 --> 01:01:45.580]  That's what I told him.
[01:01:45.580 --> 01:01:46.580]  He starts laughing.
[01:01:46.580 --> 01:01:47.580]  That's what this is.
[01:01:47.580 --> 01:01:51.140]  Okay, there's no making deals with these people.
[01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:54.340]  They're going to get me, Mr. President, if they get you, I need you to stay in office
[01:01:54.340 --> 01:01:55.340]  now.
[01:01:55.340 --> 01:01:56.740]  This is a total war.
[01:01:56.740 --> 01:01:59.780]  So this isn't me kissing your ass and you got to go on the offense.
[01:01:59.780 --> 01:02:00.780]  You got to do it, sir.
[01:02:00.780 --> 01:02:02.220]  Don't your instincts tell you that?
[01:02:02.220 --> 01:02:04.220]  He's like, well, they do.
[01:02:04.220 --> 01:02:05.420]  You think people talk to Trump like that?
[01:02:05.420 --> 01:02:09.020]  No, nobody does that.
[01:02:09.020 --> 01:02:13.580]  I've done the talking when I get a chance to talk to Trump because he's got the power
[01:02:13.580 --> 01:02:17.620]  and I defended him and put myself in the arena and now they're trying to kill me.
[01:02:17.620 --> 01:02:19.620]  So I need Trump to execute properly.
[01:02:19.620 --> 01:02:26.460]  Now, here's the closer Congressman Mike Johnson here it is and on page 174 volume two, your
[01:02:26.460 --> 01:02:31.340]  report also acknowledges that the Supreme Court has held quote, the president's removal
[01:02:31.340 --> 01:02:35.060]  powers are at their zenith with respect to principal officers.
[01:02:35.060 --> 01:02:39.220]  That is, officers who must be appointed by the president and who report to him directly.
[01:02:39.220 --> 01:02:43.620]  The president's exclusive and illimitable power of removal of those principal officers
[01:02:43.620 --> 01:02:47.980]  furthers the president's ability to ensure that the laws are faithfully executed, unquote.
[01:02:47.980 --> 01:02:49.620]  And that would even include the attorney general.
[01:02:49.620 --> 01:02:55.100]  Look, in spite of all of that, nothing ever happened to stop or impede your special counsel's
[01:02:55.100 --> 01:02:56.340]  investigation.
[01:02:56.340 --> 01:02:58.060]  Nobody was fired by the president.
[01:02:58.060 --> 01:03:03.140]  Everything was curtailed and the investigation continued unencumbered for 22 long months.
[01:03:03.140 --> 01:03:07.180]  As you finally concluded in volume one, the evidence, quote, did not establish that the
[01:03:07.180 --> 01:03:11.260]  president was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference,
[01:03:11.260 --> 01:03:12.260]  unquote.
[01:03:12.260 --> 01:03:16.460]  And the evidence, quote, did not establish that the president or those close to him
[01:03:16.460 --> 01:03:20.700]  were involved in any Russian conspiracies or had an unlawful relationship with any
[01:03:20.700 --> 01:03:22.900]  Russian official, unquote.
[01:03:22.900 --> 01:03:26.820]  Over those 22 long months that your investigation dragged along, the president became increasingly
[01:03:26.820 --> 01:03:30.980]  frustrated, as many of the American people did, with its effects on our country and his
[01:03:30.980 --> 01:03:32.380]  ability to govern.
[01:03:32.380 --> 01:03:36.300]  He vented about this to his lawyer and his close associates, and he even shared his frustrations,
[01:03:36.300 --> 01:03:37.940]  as we all know, on Twitter.
[01:03:37.940 --> 01:03:41.980]  But while the president's social media accounts might have influenced some in the media or
[01:03:41.980 --> 01:03:46.460]  the opinion of some of the American people, none of those audiences were targets or witnesses
[01:03:46.460 --> 01:03:48.100]  in your investigation.
[01:03:48.100 --> 01:03:50.460]  The president never affected anybody's testimony.
[01:03:50.460 --> 01:03:54.220]  He never demanded to end the investigation or demanded that you be terminated.
[01:03:54.220 --> 01:03:58.300]  And he never misled Congress, the DOJ, or the special counsel.
[01:03:58.300 --> 01:04:00.580]  Those, sir, are undisputed facts.
[01:04:00.580 --> 01:04:03.580]  There will be a lot of discussion, I predict, today, and great frustration throughout the
[01:04:03.580 --> 01:04:07.220]  country about the fact that you wouldn't answer any questions here about the origins of this
[01:04:07.220 --> 01:04:12.340]  whole charade, which was the infamous Christopher Steele dossier now proven to be totally bogus,
[01:04:12.340 --> 01:04:15.620]  even though it is listed and specifically referenced in your report.
[01:04:15.620 --> 01:04:19.380]  But as our hearing is concluding, we apparently will get no comment on that from you.
[01:04:19.380 --> 01:04:23.900]  Mr. Mueller, there's one primary reason why you were called here today, and by the Democrat
[01:04:23.900 --> 01:04:27.860]  majority of our committee, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle just want political
[01:04:27.860 --> 01:04:28.860]  cover.
[01:04:28.860 --> 01:04:32.380]  They desperately wanted you today to tell them they should impeach the president.
[01:04:32.380 --> 01:04:36.500]  But the one thing you have said very clearly today is that your report is complete and
[01:04:36.500 --> 01:04:40.500]  thorough, and you completely agree with and stand by its recommendations and all of its
[01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:41.500]  content.
[01:04:41.500 --> 01:04:42.500]  Is that right?
[01:04:42.500 --> 01:04:43.500]  True.
[01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:45.340]  Mr. Mueller, one last important question.
[01:04:45.340 --> 01:04:48.900]  Your report does not recommend impeachment, does it?
[01:04:48.900 --> 01:04:52.900]  I'm not going to talk about recommendations.
[01:04:52.900 --> 01:04:55.180]  It does not conclude that impeachment would be appropriate here.
[01:04:55.180 --> 01:04:58.460]  Time to put that old boy out to pasture.
[01:04:58.460 --> 01:05:04.980]  As we witness the most disastrous geological activity in recorded history, the globalists
[01:05:04.980 --> 01:05:09.700]  are backed into a corner, and the leftists are pushing for civil war.
[01:05:09.700 --> 01:05:13.780]  Borders are being broken, and sovereignty is being challenged.
[01:05:13.780 --> 01:05:20.700]  The world is going to change, and how it changes will likely be decided by those who are prepared
[01:05:20.700 --> 01:05:23.900]  to stay strong when the system fails.
[01:05:23.900 --> 01:05:29.900]  The system is vulnerable, electricity could be gone in an instant, and grocery stores
[01:05:29.900 --> 01:05:32.420]  could be empty in three days.
[01:05:32.420 --> 01:05:37.900]  Having storable foods and the ability to purify water will give you a fighting chance in the
[01:05:37.900 --> 01:05:43.420]  next level, and being without puts you at the mercy of others or makes you a slave to
[01:05:43.420 --> 01:05:45.100]  a dying system.
[01:05:45.100 --> 01:05:50.660]  Buy storable foods and an Alexa Pure Gravity water filter today.
[01:05:50.660 --> 01:06:05.100]  Support mankind by being prepared, and support freedom by buying from InfowarsStore.com.
[01:06:05.100 --> 01:06:12.100]  Devastating globalist lies, exposing the mainstream media's propaganda machine.
[01:06:12.100 --> 01:06:18.900]  Firelessly waging war on corruption, from deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6 in Austin,
[01:06:18.900 --> 01:06:19.900]  Texas.
[01:06:19.900 --> 01:06:23.980]  Transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:49.220]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:06:49.220 --> 01:06:55.140]  Your calls are coming up, bottom of the hour, and I got more news, and it's just every day
[01:06:55.140 --> 01:06:56.140]  it gets more insane.
[01:06:56.140 --> 01:07:00.060]  I'll be blitzing through news as well once we get to your calls.
[01:07:00.060 --> 01:07:05.700]  I'm going to give the number out now, and I'm just asking listeners, first-time callers,
[01:07:05.700 --> 01:07:09.540]  that means if you ever called but didn't get on because our phone system can take 100 calls
[01:07:09.540 --> 01:07:14.500]  at a time or whatever, or you've never been on before, I want to hear from you about what
[01:07:14.500 --> 01:07:20.180]  you thought if you watched the hearings this morning, and the media response, and what
[01:07:20.180 --> 01:07:21.180]  you got from it.
[01:07:21.180 --> 01:07:25.180]  A lot of people thought, oh, Mueller's acting like a nice old man.
[01:07:25.180 --> 01:07:27.340]  The handshaking was real.
[01:07:27.340 --> 01:07:36.020]  The blanking out, the not caring is somebody that goes in and out of gear, because most
[01:07:36.020 --> 01:07:38.340]  people have Alzheimer's in their family.
[01:07:38.340 --> 01:07:39.340]  Most people dealt with it.
[01:07:39.340 --> 01:07:40.340]  You've seen it.
[01:07:40.340 --> 01:07:45.900]  It's like, and Mueller was going in and out of gear the entire time, because there were
[01:07:45.900 --> 01:07:51.100]  times when he was just on the horns, when he was in trouble and he wouldn't defend himself
[01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:56.660]  and was just floundering around, and he had that, you know, that old man look, the look
[01:07:56.660 --> 01:07:59.020]  of no teeth kind of not caring.
[01:07:59.020 --> 01:08:05.340]  He was going in and out of gear, and again, it's emblematic of Hillary and her seizures
[01:08:05.340 --> 01:08:11.580]  and falling down constantly, and that there's new video out on infowars.com, it's from AmericanMirror.com.
[01:08:11.580 --> 01:08:16.060]  Video Joe Biden stumbles, slurs, coughs through speech, wonders, what am I doing?
[01:08:16.060 --> 01:08:20.820]  Let's go to DrudgeReport.com, because Drudge is so good at just boiling it all down to
[01:08:20.820 --> 01:08:25.860]  its essence, dazed and confused.
[01:08:25.860 --> 01:08:29.180]  I was thinking this morning, what should I call the broadcast?
[01:08:29.180 --> 01:08:31.740]  Because, you know, we always have a page we post every day that has the audio and video
[01:08:31.740 --> 01:08:38.500]  feeds in it, AutismForwards.com, and we put that headline up there that, this is a disaster
[01:08:38.500 --> 01:08:49.980]  for the Democrats, this is a derailment, that Mueller appeared to be not there, and again,
[01:08:49.980 --> 01:08:52.500]  he would win an Oscar if it was fake.
[01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:55.820]  I agree, it was so bad, some of my crew was like, well, he's doing that on purpose, no,
[01:08:55.820 --> 01:09:00.460]  no, he's not doing it on purpose, he's going in and out of gear, he'd be there, he wouldn't
[01:09:00.460 --> 01:09:01.460]  be there.
[01:09:01.460 --> 01:09:06.740]  The most frustrating thing ever to talk to a grandparent or somebody who you've known
[01:09:06.740 --> 01:09:11.100]  your whole life who was fiery with their intellect, and then you see them going in and out of
[01:09:11.100 --> 01:09:16.100]  gear, and sometimes they say something really cool and they're there, and it's amazing,
[01:09:16.100 --> 01:09:21.740]  but you see them go out of gear, and this is why they didn't want him to testify.
[01:09:21.740 --> 01:09:27.460]  The Democrats thought this was going to be impeachment, and he's this godlike figure,
[01:09:27.460 --> 01:09:30.380]  and he's invincible, and he can't be stopped.
[01:09:30.380 --> 01:09:38.420]  Your champion is 73 years old and is sharper than anybody I know from, with his instincts,
[01:09:38.420 --> 01:09:46.380]  his intellect, his analysis, his gestalt, thin slicing, and then look at all their champions,
[01:09:46.380 --> 01:09:55.820]  bumbling, drooling, put out the pastor, and scared.
[01:09:55.820 --> 01:10:00.660]  DrudgeReport.com, with that photo, we have just put that behind us here, the whole Drudge
[01:10:00.660 --> 01:10:06.900]  Report headline for the next hour, because it's emblematic of this, as I keep saying.
[01:10:06.900 --> 01:10:14.940]  Drudge didn't just pause some videos still to get that, that look that Mueller has, is
[01:10:14.940 --> 01:10:21.540]  someone that knows, Trump caught them, he withstood them, he has all the evidence, all
[01:10:21.540 --> 01:10:26.140]  the dirt, all the intel, everything, of the crimes they committed, and the perjury to Congress,
[01:10:26.140 --> 01:10:31.380]  and paying their families at Fusion GPS, and just everything.
[01:10:31.380 --> 01:10:42.220]  The FISA court two years ago put out a report saying we found misconduct in info we were
[01:10:42.220 --> 01:10:46.940]  given to allow these warrants on Trump during the campaign and after, and we called for
[01:10:46.940 --> 01:10:47.940]  an investigation.
[01:10:47.940 --> 01:10:54.220]  The bureau coverage, I get a call from William Benning, former head of the national security
[01:10:54.220 --> 01:10:58.700]  agency, technical, he actually ran it, not the political head, the number two guy at
[01:10:58.700 --> 01:11:02.860]  NSA, the guy that created all this stuff, literally, he's credited with like, he's the
[01:11:02.860 --> 01:11:07.700]  mastermind, okay, he's like a comic book, who's the guy that like super smart in comic
[01:11:07.700 --> 01:11:11.220]  books and like knows things psychically or whatever, okay, well that's basically the
[01:11:11.220 --> 01:11:15.140]  character he's based on, okay, the guy's the big brain.
[01:11:15.140 --> 01:11:20.060]  And what did he say?
[01:11:20.060 --> 01:11:25.740]  He said, no one's covered this, this has been out for six months, I got a call, did you
[01:11:25.740 --> 01:11:32.180]  know that the FISA court did a inspector general of the federal courts put a report out saying
[01:11:32.180 --> 01:11:38.540]  this is all a fraud, and that it's all a scam, and that the warrants were illegally obtained?
[01:11:38.540 --> 01:11:47.140]  That's coffin nails to these people, and ladies and gentlemen, that's only one piece of it.
[01:11:47.140 --> 01:11:51.500]  When I try to think of all the pieces, it gives me a headache, there are hundreds, Admiral
[01:11:51.500 --> 01:11:54.420]  Rogers came to Trump, when he was President of the United States, they're illegally spying
[01:11:54.420 --> 01:11:57.860]  on you, here's all the evidence, they're patriots in the government, who aren't gonna be part
[01:11:57.860 --> 01:12:02.380]  of this crap, and that's what I'm saying is the Democrats are done folks, they're done
[01:12:02.380 --> 01:12:07.900]  if we just move against them, and Trump doesn't get bullied by them or the mainstream media.
[01:12:07.900 --> 01:12:10.020]  We're gonna go to break, I'll play more of the clips when we come back, then I'll give
[01:12:10.020 --> 01:12:13.340]  the number out, we'll take your calls, but let me show you a nice little tweet here from
[01:12:13.340 --> 01:12:18.420]  Jack Pasobic at Jack Pasobic on Twitter, imagine if Mueller took brain force, which is the
[01:12:18.420 --> 01:12:22.500]  best new tropic out there, there are other brands that are $100 that aren't as good,
[01:12:22.500 --> 01:12:26.460]  because they don't put any product in it, this has all the great stuff for healthy, clean,
[01:12:26.460 --> 01:12:31.300]  focused, and I know Jack Pasobic loves brain force, former naval intelligent, great patriot,
[01:12:31.300 --> 01:12:37.020]  one American news network, and so Rob Dew retweeted him a little ad we did that's fun on brain
[01:12:37.020 --> 01:12:43.340]  force, so here it is, but get your brain force at infowarstore.com, or infowarstlife.com,
[01:12:43.340 --> 01:12:48.900]  but something tells me no amount of brain force plus would ever get Robert Mueller, who's
[01:12:48.900 --> 01:12:53.340]  been a fixant man, a nobody, sure he did some stuff in Vietnam, but after that, he's been
[01:12:53.340 --> 01:13:00.100]  nothing but a cover up artist, here's the report, I said one time, who's in charge here, and
[01:13:00.100 --> 01:13:07.340]  I think the congressman's right about that fact, there you want some, yeah, I got some,
[01:13:07.340 --> 01:13:13.980]  some here, Jerry, take a drink, look a little dehydrated brother, you seem a little dehydrated,
[01:13:13.980 --> 01:13:14.980]  you okay?
[01:13:14.980 --> 01:13:24.940]  Well, on the floor, and I had anticipated in custody of the border, everyone, they started
[01:13:24.940 --> 01:13:28.820]  making, sending signals to the U.S., Mexico, Canada.
[01:13:28.820 --> 01:13:30.980]  This is what happens when the meth doesn't work anymore.
[01:13:30.980 --> 01:13:36.900]  That's not the accurate, some people call it after NAFTA, some call it NAFTA 2.0, working
[01:13:36.900 --> 01:13:43.340]  together to make, pass that, you know, brain force works so well, I don't think I'm gonna
[01:13:43.340 --> 01:13:46.500]  send it to Pelosi, no, that'd be a good stunt though.
[01:13:46.500 --> 01:13:52.980]  But the president again, stormed out, I think, what, first pound the table, walk out the
[01:13:52.980 --> 01:13:53.980]  door.
[01:13:53.980 --> 01:13:59.820]  He's the one who sold us out to China, and now it's not, it's hard to get rid of them?
[01:13:59.820 --> 01:14:00.820]  Three things.
[01:14:00.820 --> 01:14:01.820]  Three things.
[01:14:01.820 --> 01:14:04.820]  You want to take a drink with us to keep yourself some?
[01:14:04.820 --> 01:14:06.820]  How you feel, man?
[01:14:06.820 --> 01:14:07.820]  You okay?
[01:14:07.820 --> 01:14:08.820]  I'm okay.
[01:14:08.820 --> 01:14:09.820]  You alright?
[01:14:09.820 --> 01:14:13.820]  I get Nadler, Hillary, all of them, they need brain force plus.
[01:14:13.820 --> 01:14:14.820]  Left, left.
[01:14:14.820 --> 01:14:15.820]  How you feel, man?
[01:14:15.820 --> 01:14:21.380]  Never seen Nadler stand straight up, and he looks like the ping-pong.
[01:14:21.380 --> 01:14:25.140]  We can walk and chew gum at the same time, I hope he can too.
[01:14:25.140 --> 01:14:31.620]  I want to just put out a message right now to the Democrats, because look, your leaders,
[01:14:31.620 --> 01:14:37.580]  Nancy Pelosi and Jerry Nadler are struggling.
[01:14:37.580 --> 01:14:45.180]  And so we've got brain force plus at infowarstore.com, and if there has ever been an example of
[01:14:45.180 --> 01:14:50.220]  somebody that needs brain force plus, the neural activator, it's Nancy Pelosi and it's
[01:14:50.220 --> 01:14:51.220]  Jerry Nadler.
[01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:58.580]  Now, unfortunately, we're not miracle workers here, and we can only do so much with our
[01:14:58.580 --> 01:15:04.660]  great supplements at infowarstore.com, but if there's any hope at all for Nancy Pelosi

[01:17:23.500 --> 01:17:27.740]  Not a security IPO or note, blockchain data centers have approved a turnkey equipment

[01:17:52.780 --> 01:17:58.500]  before purchasing not an offer to buy or sell a security which requires an offering document.
[01:17:58.500 --> 01:18:05.220]  As we gather this evening in the joy of freedom we remember that all share a truly extraordinary
[01:18:05.220 --> 01:18:06.900]  heritage.
[01:18:06.900 --> 01:18:12.740]  Together we are part of one of the greatest stories ever told, the story of America.
[01:18:12.740 --> 01:18:18.140]  It is the epic tale of a great nation whose people have risked everything for what they
[01:18:18.140 --> 01:18:22.580]  know is right and what they know is true.
[01:18:22.580 --> 01:18:28.940]  As long as we stay true to our cause, as long as we remember our great history, as long
[01:18:28.940 --> 01:18:36.220]  as we never ever stop fighting for a better future, then there will be nothing that America
[01:18:36.220 --> 01:18:56.220]  can not do.
[01:18:56.220 --> 01:19:02.580]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena and the public square.
[01:19:02.580 --> 01:19:06.620]  The other thing that's unique about Info Wars is it isn't the only network of this
[01:19:06.620 --> 01:19:11.060]  reach that is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy, that's not backed
[01:19:11.060 --> 01:19:15.300]  by some billionaire, that's not being funded by a secret foreign government, it is completely
[01:19:15.300 --> 01:19:16.300]  independent of all that.
[01:19:16.300 --> 01:19:22.100]  It is an old school American 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of press
[01:19:22.100 --> 01:19:25.980]  and freedom of speech that in fact the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of
[01:19:25.980 --> 01:19:30.340]  the country, they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations just like this
[01:19:30.340 --> 01:19:33.900]  because this was the kind of press they wanted and that ultimately we now live in an era
[01:19:33.900 --> 01:19:37.740]  where they've mostly been co-opted by big corporations or billionaire sugar daddies
[01:19:37.740 --> 01:19:41.780]  who have been able to control and manipulate what news and views the person is allowed
[01:19:41.780 --> 01:19:46.420]  to have or express or hear and the Info Wars audience has broken through that.
[01:19:46.420 --> 01:19:50.820]  They are the bridge from the founding to the modern age ultimate American democracy and
[01:19:50.820 --> 01:19:55.660]  freedom and that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught of the blackwarming defamation, law
[01:19:55.660 --> 01:20:01.980]  fair and libel targeting youth.
[01:20:01.980 --> 01:20:29.540]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:29.540 --> 01:20:59.500]  We're listening to Alex Jones, Alex Jones, Alex Jones, Alex Jones, Alex Jones, Alex
[01:20:59.500 --> 01:21:01.780]  Jones, Alex Jones, Alex Jones.
[01:21:01.780 --> 01:21:03.420]  We're listening toкая.
[01:21:03.420 --> 01:21:15.800]  We are listening to Alex Jones, Alex Jones, Alex Jones, Alex Jones, Alex Jones.
[01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:20.280]  It's the beginning of the park.
[01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:24.220]  It is the beginning of the market.
[01:21:24.220 --> 01:21:32.220]  That hearing today and the whole train wreck of three years and Mueller bumbling around and saying he didn't ever remember meeting Rosenstein or the Attorney General
[01:21:32.220 --> 01:21:37.020]  The days before when those meetings were public. I mean this was the bottom falling out
[01:21:37.020 --> 01:21:44.620]  And I don't think Republicans realize what just happened because I'm scanning the news and drudge gets it says days and confused but
[01:21:45.180 --> 01:21:47.620]  More than that lion his ass off
[01:21:47.620 --> 01:21:54.520]  He didn't say I don't recall. He said I
[01:21:54.520 --> 01:21:58.020]  Was not aware I was not aware
[01:22:00.020 --> 01:22:03.720]  You know, I don't have Alzheimer's but my brain doesn't work as good as it used to but Matt
[01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:09.320]  There's no teleprompter but Matt pops in my ear and reminded me I was not aware. What kind of I was not aware
[01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:14.420]  I met with these people over and over again in the huge shakeup in DC for the whole power structure
[01:22:14.420 --> 01:22:18.660]  I was not aware and maybe he's so seen all he doesn't. What do you think of that?
[01:22:19.220 --> 01:22:24.540]  877-789-2539 877-789 Alex, but here's the deal
[01:22:25.500 --> 01:22:29.980]  I'm getting a little bit better over this over the years, but I used to be really obnoxious 20 years ago about calls
[01:22:29.980 --> 01:22:34.140]  I was like, bam, bam. He's personally got like a minute and I'd get to hundreds of calls of show now
[01:22:34.140 --> 01:22:37.940]  I oh Alex, you're great. Okay. You're great, too. It's like rushed has diddos
[01:22:38.700 --> 01:22:43.100]  We say we love each other. We're awesome, but I want to get to you want to get to the next person
[01:22:43.100 --> 01:22:46.940]  I want folks holding so just get into what you thought the bottom line what you think's coming next
[01:22:47.220 --> 01:22:50.420]  You agree with me that this means that they're not going to give up folks
[01:22:50.420 --> 01:22:54.100]  They're just going to go forward even though the investigation is the evidence of the crimes
[01:22:54.340 --> 01:23:01.140]  And it's what they did trying to overthrow an elected president and all this propaganda is the scandal of the century
[01:23:02.140 --> 01:23:06.180]  877-789 Alex 877-789 Alex
[01:23:07.220 --> 01:23:09.220]  We're going to take your phone calls
[01:23:09.220 --> 01:23:14.220]  Let's get these clips there. I'll never get to them. There's so many I'll get to all these today one way or another
[01:23:14.220 --> 01:23:16.220]  We've only gotten to four of them so far
[01:23:16.740 --> 01:23:19.980]  Let's go ahead and go to representative Louie Gomer
[01:23:20.620 --> 01:23:24.220]  pushes and pressures Mueller on whether anti-trump bias existed
[01:23:24.220 --> 01:23:27.900]  That's like asking if the sky is blue at high noon. Here it is
[01:23:28.540 --> 01:23:30.260]  Thank You mr. Chairman
[01:23:30.260 --> 01:23:37.740]  Mr. Mueller well first let me ask a unanimous consent, mr. Chairman to submit this article
[01:23:37.740 --> 01:23:43.100]  Robert Muller unmasked for the record with that objection now
[01:23:43.980 --> 01:23:50.380]  Mr. Muller who wrote the nine-minute comments you read at your May 29th press conference?
[01:23:51.180 --> 01:23:53.180]  I'm not gonna get into that
[01:23:53.300 --> 01:23:55.700]  Okay, so that's what I thought you didn't write it a
[01:23:56.380 --> 01:24:04.020]  2013 puff piece in the Washingtonian about Comey said basically when Comey called you drop everything you were doing it gave
[01:24:04.020 --> 01:24:10.020]  Examples you're having dinner with your wife and daughter Comey calls you drop everything and go
[01:24:10.660 --> 01:24:19.060]  It's article quoted Comey is saying if a train were coming down the track and I quote at least Bob Mueller will be standing on the tracks with me
[01:24:19.940 --> 01:24:26.100]  You and James Comey have been good friends or were good friends for eight for many years correct
[01:24:26.100 --> 01:24:31.420]  Oh, we were business associates. We both started off in the Justice Department about you were good friends
[01:24:31.420 --> 01:24:36.980]  You can work together or not be friends, but you were coming we're friends. We were friends. That's my question
[01:24:36.980 --> 01:24:41.900]  Thank you for getting to the answer now before you were appointed as special counsel
[01:24:43.220 --> 01:24:47.180]  Had you talked to James Comey in the preceding six months? No
[01:24:48.340 --> 01:24:51.580]  When you were appointed as special counsel
[01:24:52.820 --> 01:24:54.500]  Was president?
[01:24:54.500 --> 01:25:01.260]  Trump's firing of Comey something you anticipated investigating potentially obstruction adjust I get into that
[01:25:02.140 --> 01:25:06.900]  That's a internal deliberation to the Justice Department actually it goes to your credibility
[01:25:06.900 --> 01:25:10.620]  And maybe you've been away from the courtroom for a while credibility is always relevant
[01:25:10.620 --> 01:25:14.380]  It's always material and that goes for you too. You're a witness before us
[01:25:14.380 --> 01:25:21.220]  Let me ask you when you talked to President Trump the day before he appointed or you were appointed as special counsel
[01:25:21.220 --> 01:25:24.840]  You were talking to him about FBI director position again
[01:25:26.020 --> 01:25:30.140]  Did he mention the firing of James Comey? Not as a candidate
[01:25:30.140 --> 01:25:37.500]  I was asked did he mention the firing of James Comey in your discussion with him cannot remember?
[01:25:38.140 --> 01:25:42.660]  Pardon cannot remember it. Don't believe so. I'm not gonna be remember
[01:25:42.940 --> 01:25:51.140]  But if he did you could been a fact witness as to the president's comments and state of mind on firing
[01:25:51.140 --> 01:25:55.340]  James Comey, so I suppose that's possible. Yeah, so
[01:25:55.940 --> 01:25:59.940]  Most prosecutors want to make sure there's no appearance of impropriety
[01:26:00.700 --> 01:26:06.740]  But in your case you hired a bunch of people that did not like the president
[01:26:06.940 --> 01:26:13.900]  Let me ask you when did you first learn of Peter Struck's animus toward Donald Trump in the summer of?
[01:26:15.620 --> 01:26:17.820]  2017 you didn't know before he was hired
[01:26:17.820 --> 01:26:22.620]  I'm sorry. Would you you didn't know before he was hired for your team?
[01:26:24.380 --> 01:26:26.380]  Know what?
[01:26:27.180 --> 01:26:30.660]  Peter Struck hated trying dumb bastard
[01:26:31.100 --> 01:26:36.460]  You didn't know that before he was made part of your team. Is that what you said? I did not know that
[01:26:36.980 --> 01:26:40.460]  Alright, when did you learn when he did find out?
[01:26:40.460 --> 01:26:43.980]  I acted swiftly to have him reassigned elsewhere in the well
[01:26:43.980 --> 01:26:46.500]  There's some discussion about how swift that was
[01:26:46.500 --> 01:26:50.060]  But when did you learn of the ongoing affair he was having with Lisa Page?
[01:26:50.860 --> 01:26:52.860]  About the same time. Okay
[01:26:53.900 --> 01:26:55.620]  struck
[01:26:55.620 --> 01:26:57.620]  Did you ever order anybody to?

[01:27:21.660 --> 01:27:23.660]  No, there was an IG investigation

[01:27:56.020 --> 01:28:02.820]  They did not conspire with anybody from Russia to affect the election and
[01:28:03.260 --> 01:28:08.940]  They see the big Justice Department with people that hate that person
[01:28:09.820 --> 01:28:14.460]  Coming after them and then a special of counsel appointed who hires
[01:28:15.420 --> 01:28:18.300]  Dozen or more people that hate that person
[01:28:19.260 --> 01:28:21.260]  And he knows he's innocent
[01:28:21.260 --> 01:28:27.660]  He is not corruptly acting in order to see that justice is done
[01:28:27.700 --> 01:28:31.220]  What he's doing is not obstructing justice
[01:28:31.220 --> 01:28:35.680]  He is pursuing justice and the fact that you ran it out two years
[01:28:36.180 --> 01:28:37.700]  You

[01:30:08.540 --> 01:30:12.620]  Federal courts would be ruling that it's a hate symbol. That's all happening
[01:30:13.100 --> 01:30:15.020]  The left are fascist
[01:30:15.020 --> 01:30:20.260]  Authoritarians they're bullies they're criminals and now they're trying to make us take down the American flag

[01:33:19.900 --> 01:33:26.340]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show. I'm gonna tell you something right now folks that level
[01:33:28.260 --> 01:33:31.100]  During that break meditating praying
[01:33:31.940 --> 01:33:36.260]  God for answers because I feel really good. I see a lot of good things happening
[01:33:36.340 --> 01:33:41.260]  The veils being pulled away from the globalists are being shown as the anti-human anti-god anti-family
[01:33:42.500 --> 01:33:44.660]  People that resonate with the the lie
[01:33:44.660 --> 01:33:50.780]  But I was thinking what's really paramount here before we go to these calls for the rest of broadcast and in place of key clips and news
[01:33:52.620 --> 01:33:59.180]  And it was exactly what JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs and all the central banks are doing right now because those private banks are the central banks
[01:33:59.180 --> 01:34:01.180]  They own the private fellow reserve
[01:34:01.820 --> 01:34:05.900]  They're saying the the dollar is gonna lose its World Reserve status
[01:34:07.380 --> 01:34:12.580]  And then America is going down. That's mainstream news today. They've been beating that drum hard, but it's like
[01:34:12.580 --> 01:34:17.180]  Crescendo drum solo at this point. I mean, it's got my ears bleeding
[01:34:19.500 --> 01:34:20.500]  And so
[01:34:21.140 --> 01:34:26.140]  Just like Bill Mar said, we're gonna punish you for supporting America and supporting Trump
[01:34:26.140 --> 01:34:30.900]  We're gonna teach you to hate him. We're gonna take food out of your mouth. We're gonna let your kids starve to death
[01:34:30.900 --> 01:34:36.300]  Remember him saying he wants they can't the economy to crash close quote
[01:34:37.820 --> 01:34:39.820]  That's people jumping out of windows
[01:34:39.820 --> 01:34:41.820]  That's people jumping out of windows
[01:34:42.180 --> 01:34:44.180]  that's losing the farm and
[01:34:48.460 --> 01:34:50.460]  That makes me so angry
[01:34:51.460 --> 01:34:52.580]  So
[01:34:52.580 --> 01:34:59.100]  Let me tell you something the deep states not giving up and I want everybody to know something if they're able to take the economy
[01:35:00.620 --> 01:35:08.340]  They did it they think you're so stupid that you're gonna blame America and Trump. You know what America isn't stupid
[01:35:08.340 --> 01:35:13.820]  America was asleep, and I just want to tell the globalists. I know some of you understand. You're already beaten
[01:35:13.820 --> 01:35:15.820]  You're going to lose one way or another
[01:35:19.260 --> 01:35:24.060]  You're going to lose one way or another on your suicide mission against America
[01:35:25.860 --> 01:35:28.380]  And I don't want to go down this road, but I promise you
[01:35:30.620 --> 01:35:34.860]  To the to Hillary Clinton's and and the and the and the Bill Mars and the
[01:35:34.860 --> 01:35:40.300]  Barack Obama's of the world who were recruited by evil because they hate the spirit of this nation
[01:35:40.660 --> 01:35:43.140]  you will be held accountable personally and
[01:35:44.900 --> 01:35:51.260]  Just as the Sun came up this morning is gonna set this evening you will be destroyed in this process
[01:35:52.140 --> 01:35:54.420]  Now you're so turned over to evil. You don't care
[01:35:54.460 --> 01:35:59.500]  But maybe your minions around you will get off the sinking ship because I really don't want to go down this road
[01:35:59.500 --> 01:36:04.420]  I'm committed. I'll go down the ship. You know, I'm committed to my God. You're committed to yours
[01:36:04.420 --> 01:36:08.980]  I understand it. But for everybody else, it's on the sidelines. You're not in the sidelines
[01:36:09.100 --> 01:36:14.100]  There's no spectators in the in the game of life and all the spectators that think they're gonna play both sides
[01:36:14.380 --> 01:36:16.580]  God said you weren't either hot nor cold. I
[01:36:17.220 --> 01:36:19.220]  Spit you out of my mouth
[01:36:19.340 --> 01:36:21.660]  Stop trying to ride the fence folks
[01:36:22.500 --> 01:36:25.260]  Stop trying to play in the middle of the highway. That's where you get run over
[01:36:26.220 --> 01:36:28.220]  We're entering the age of
[01:36:28.220 --> 01:36:34.780]  Purity we're entering an age of deciding what side you're on when I say purity
[01:36:37.500 --> 01:36:43.100]  Yeah, people've lived off the system and lived off our gravitas for a hundred plus years of decadence
[01:36:44.100 --> 01:36:47.740]  And you can play both sides and be corrupted get away with it. That's all coming to an end
[01:36:49.620 --> 01:36:52.740]  You're gonna decide whether you want a brain ship or not
[01:36:52.740 --> 01:36:54.540]  You're gonna decide are you for pedophilia or not?
[01:36:54.540 --> 01:37:00.380]  You're gonna decide that you hate Jesus or not because you're gonna be made to make those decisions. You're gonna have to salute
[01:37:00.980 --> 01:37:03.580]  big fat men with pink lipstick in
[01:37:04.460 --> 01:37:06.940]  pools with your underage daughters or
[01:37:07.740 --> 01:37:12.740]  You're gonna be sent to prison. You're gonna you're gonna submit to babies being killed after they're born
[01:37:13.380 --> 01:37:18.860]  You're gonna be told about it. You're gonna be shown it because the system wants your soul
[01:37:18.860 --> 01:37:25.060]  It wants you to put up with it and make a decision and you're being tested right now. We'll come we'll go to break in
[01:37:25.300 --> 01:37:27.820]  Five minutes and we'll come back to write your calls. I want to play
[01:37:28.540 --> 01:37:34.940]  Representative Jim Jordan from this morning also very powerful at the witch hunt that went off the rails event. Here it is
[01:37:36.220 --> 01:37:41.260]  director the FBI interviewed Joseph Mifsud on February 10th 2017 in
[01:37:41.740 --> 01:37:45.100]  That interview of mr. Mifsud lied you point this out on page
[01:37:45.540 --> 01:37:47.700]  193 volume one Mifsud denied
[01:37:47.700 --> 01:37:55.020]  Mifsud also falsely stated in addition Mifsud omitted three times. He lied to the FBI yet
[01:37:55.020 --> 01:38:01.500]  You didn't charge him with the crime. Excuse me. I'm sorry. Did you say 193 volume one 193?
[01:38:01.500 --> 01:38:05.260]  He lied three times you pointed out in the report. Why didn't you charge him with the crime?
[01:38:06.220 --> 01:38:10.780]  I can't get into internal deliberations with regard to a waiter would not be
[01:38:10.780 --> 01:38:17.340]  Uh, there's a lot of other people for make a false statement. Let's remember this. Let's remember this in 2016
[01:38:17.340 --> 01:38:22.660]  The FBI did something they probably haven't done before they spied on two American citizens
[01:38:23.020 --> 01:38:25.020]  Associated with a presidential campaign
[01:38:25.340 --> 01:38:30.580]  George Papadopoulos and Carter page with Carter page. They went to the FISA court
[01:38:30.980 --> 01:38:37.220]  They used the now famous dossier as part of the reason they were able to get the warrant and spy on Carter page for a better part of a
[01:38:37.220 --> 01:38:38.060]  year
[01:38:38.060 --> 01:38:41.220]  With mr. Papadopoulos they didn't go to the court
[01:38:41.740 --> 01:38:43.740]  They used human sources
[01:38:43.740 --> 01:38:48.420]  All kinds of from about the moment Papadopoulos joins the Trump campaign
[01:38:48.420 --> 01:38:53.340]  You got all these people all around the world starting to swirl around him names like Halper
[01:38:53.860 --> 01:38:59.620]  Downer Mifsud Thompson meeting in Rome London all kinds of places the FBI even sent
[01:39:00.460 --> 01:39:06.700]  Even sent a lady posing as somebody else went by the name as we're Turk even dispatched her to London
[01:39:06.700 --> 01:39:13.140]  To spy on mr. Papadopoulos in one of these meetings mr. Papadopoulos is talking to a foreign diplomat and
[01:39:13.500 --> 01:39:15.500]  He tells the diplomat
[01:39:15.540 --> 01:39:17.540]  Russians have dirt on Clinton
[01:39:17.900 --> 01:39:24.500]  That diplomat then contacts the FBI and the FBI opens an investigation based on that fact
[01:39:24.500 --> 01:39:27.700]  He point this out on page one of the report July 31st
[01:39:28.580 --> 01:39:32.580]  2016 they opened the investigation based on that piece of information
[01:39:32.580 --> 01:39:41.420]  Diplomat tells Papadopoulos Russians have dirt. Excuse me Papadopoulos tells the diplomat Russians have dirt on Clinton diplomat tells the FBI
[01:39:42.300 --> 01:39:44.300]  What I'm wondering is
[01:39:44.300 --> 01:39:46.300]  Who told Papadopoulos?
[01:39:46.540 --> 01:39:52.360]  How'd he find out I can't get into the evidently fine. Yes, you can cuz you know about it. You gave us the answer
[01:39:52.740 --> 01:39:55.500]  Page 192 of the report you tell us who told him
[01:39:56.420 --> 01:39:58.420]  Joseph Mifsud
[01:39:58.420 --> 01:40:06.740]  Joseph Mifsud's a guy who told Papadopoulos the mysterious professor who lives in Rome in London works at teach in two different universities
[01:40:06.740 --> 01:40:08.740]  This is the guy who told Papadopoulos
[01:40:09.340 --> 01:40:13.540]  He's the guy who starts it all and when the FBI interviews him
[01:40:14.100 --> 01:40:20.220]  He lies three times and yet you don't charge him with a crime. You charge Rick Gates for false statements
[01:40:20.220 --> 01:40:27.580]  You charge Paul Manafort for false statements. You charge Michael Cullen with false statements. You charge Michael Flynn a three-star general with false statements
[01:40:27.580 --> 01:40:31.180]  But the guy who puts the country through this whole saga
[01:40:31.980 --> 01:40:39.660]  Starts it all for three years. We've lived this now. He lies and you guys don't charge you and I'm curious as to why
[01:40:40.140 --> 01:40:42.140]  well, I can't get into it and
[01:40:42.500 --> 01:40:47.180]  And it's obvious. I think that we can't get into charging decisions when the FBI interviewed him in February
[01:40:47.860 --> 01:40:49.860]  FBI interviews him in February
[01:40:49.940 --> 01:40:54.340]  When the special counsel's office interviewed Mifsud, did he lie to you guys too?
[01:40:54.340 --> 01:41:00.900]  Can't get into that. Did you interview Mifsud? Can't get into that. Is Mifsud Western intelligence or Russian intelligence?
[01:41:00.900 --> 01:41:06.100]  Can't get into that. A lot of things you can't get into. What's interesting? You can charge 13 Russians
[01:41:06.340 --> 01:41:10.500]  No one's ever heard of. No one's ever seen. No one's ever gonna hear of them
[01:41:10.500 --> 01:41:16.180]  No one's ever gonna see him. You can charge them. You can charge all kinds of people who are around the president with false statements
[01:41:17.220 --> 01:41:21.860]  But the guy who launches every the guy who puts this whole story in motion
[01:41:21.860 --> 01:41:28.540]  You can't charge him. I think that's amazing. I'm not certain. I agree with your
[01:41:28.860 --> 01:41:32.820]  Characterizations. Well, I'm reading from your report. Mifsud told Papadopoulos
[01:41:33.220 --> 01:41:39.020]  Papadopoulos tells the diplomat the diplomat tells the FBI the FBI opens the investigation July 31st 2016
[01:41:39.020 --> 01:41:41.020]  And here we are three years later
[01:41:41.620 --> 01:41:46.300]  July of 2019 the country's been put through this and the central figure who launches it all
[01:41:46.300 --> 01:41:51.260]  Well, lies to us and you guys don't hunt him down and interview him again
[01:41:51.980 --> 01:41:56.300]  And you don't charge him with a crime because they will pay and Trump. Here's the good news
[01:41:57.100 --> 01:42:01.180]  The president was falsely accused of conspiracy. The FBI does a 10 month investigation
[01:42:01.180 --> 01:42:06.940]  He told me when we opposed him a year ago told us at that point they had nothing you do a 22 month investigation
[01:42:06.940 --> 01:42:11.180]  The end of that 22 months you find no conspiracy and what's the democrats want to do?
[01:42:11.900 --> 01:42:13.740]  They want to keep investigating
[01:42:13.740 --> 01:42:17.020]  They want to keep going maybe a better course of action
[01:42:17.660 --> 01:42:22.140]  Maybe a better course of action is to figure out how the false accusation started
[01:42:22.220 --> 01:42:22.700]  Oh, we know
[01:42:22.700 --> 01:42:28.220]  Maybe to go back and actually figure out why Joseph Mifsud was lying to the FBI and here's the good news
[01:42:28.780 --> 01:42:32.540]  Here's the good news. That's exactly what bill bar is doing
[01:42:33.100 --> 01:42:36.780]  And thank goodness for that. That's exactly what the attorney general and john derm are doing
[01:42:36.780 --> 01:42:41.020]  They're going to find out why we went through this three years. That's the only part I don't agree with
[01:42:41.020 --> 01:42:44.220]  Can you see those those lawyers behind muller your TV viewer?
[01:42:44.940 --> 01:42:46.940]  All of them are deep state
[01:42:47.900 --> 01:42:54.060]  And bar is desperately trying to save their ass that the democrats won't stop attacking forcing his hand
[01:42:57.420 --> 01:43:03.100]  Last night I'm on info wars.com and I read chris pratt criticized for t-shirt choice
[01:43:03.260 --> 01:43:10.220]  It is literally the shirt that I envisioned a betsy ross but also another just classic american flag all 50 stars
[01:43:10.220 --> 01:43:16.140]  With the gads and snake super imposed over and on the back america's back info wars.com
[01:43:16.220 --> 01:43:20.940]  But what's better than just an american flag about a don't tread on me under the flag take don't trail the american flag
[01:43:21.020 --> 01:43:23.980]  It's a perfect combo. So great minds think alike. I mean whoever designed that shirt
[01:43:24.060 --> 01:43:26.540]  We'd already come up with the exact same similar design
[01:43:26.620 --> 01:43:33.100]  It is the don't tread on me american flag t-shirt inspired by the triggering of leftist of the shirt worn by
[01:43:33.340 --> 01:43:38.380]  chris pratt let it say you know battle tattered flag like the one that flew over fort sumpner and again on the back
[01:43:38.380 --> 01:43:41.820]  It says america's back info wars.com
[01:43:42.140 --> 01:43:49.740]  4,000 of these babies and that's it. So we've got the betsy ross version and the american flag version at info wars store
[01:43:49.900 --> 01:43:56.380]  Dot com be imprinted in the usa right now info wars store.com. We'll be right back the most banned broadcast in the world
[01:43:57.100 --> 01:43:59.100]  Before I started working at info wars
[01:43:59.340 --> 01:44:05.260]  I was not only a fan of alex jones and info wars.com, but also the products at info wars store.com
[01:44:05.260 --> 01:44:09.500]  And there's one product that's offered at info wars store.com. That is the elite
[01:44:10.060 --> 01:44:12.780]  Of the supplements and that's dna force plus now
[01:44:12.780 --> 01:44:16.220]  I remember when alex first started talking about this with some of his special guests
[01:44:16.780 --> 01:44:19.980]  telomeres and telomere support with your dna
[01:44:20.300 --> 01:44:27.020]  And so I started to look into the science and what telomeres were and how it can improve your health and longevity
[01:44:27.420 --> 01:44:32.220]  When you protect your telomere. So I started looking into dna force plus, but it's expensive
[01:44:32.220 --> 01:44:39.580]  Why because it is an elite supplement and then I started seeing other competitors coming up with competitive supplements for
[01:44:39.740 --> 01:44:41.020]  telomere support
[01:44:41.020 --> 01:44:47.020]  And they came and they went but dna force plus is still there. It is the elite supplement
[01:44:47.260 --> 01:44:51.020]  I get excited when dna force plus is on sale because I know it's expensive
[01:44:51.100 --> 01:44:57.020]  So you should take advantage of 50 off dna force plus at info wars store.com
[01:44:57.020 --> 01:45:02.300]  Robert Barnes, what does big tech become a big tech or big babies that have become big bullies and the way they did
[01:45:02.300 --> 01:45:08.140]  So is because they face no consequence of social economic political or legal for their illicit activities over two decades
[01:45:08.140 --> 01:45:13.420]  And because of that, that's why the courts the judges the juries the members of the independent free press that care about this
[01:45:13.420 --> 01:45:18.540]  The ordinary members of the public in the audience that care about this has to bring real social political economic
[01:45:18.540 --> 01:45:22.860]  Consequence to their course of conduct. Otherwise, they will never change and they will become the big tech
[01:45:22.860 --> 01:45:27.980]  Oligarchs the equivalent to the big trust of the 19th century who ran American politics and ran American economy
[01:45:27.980 --> 01:45:31.340]  Almost into the ground until we were able to recover after the great depression
[01:45:31.340 --> 01:45:38.860]  The inforores audience is the fuel that flames the the light of liberty across the world to make real the actions of independent free speech
[01:45:38.860 --> 01:45:43.820]  To make real the original promise of an independent free press real collusion is big tech and big media
[01:45:43.820 --> 01:45:48.780]  Manipulating and working with each other to try to meddle with elections to try to shake people's thoughts
[01:45:48.780 --> 01:45:53.500]  And then the whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening. It's the ultimate form of gaslighting
[01:45:53.500 --> 01:45:57.260]  What you just saw isn't what you just saw even it is what what you just saw
[01:45:58.220 --> 01:46:03.260]  Serving with inforores is a great honor, but I still need my morning coffee

[01:47:27.260 --> 01:47:35.260]  Don't take it lying down
[01:47:35.260 --> 01:47:39.260]  Don't you take it lying down
[01:47:39.260 --> 01:47:43.260]  We're not taking it lying down
[01:47:43.260 --> 01:47:45.260]  No, we're fighting back
[01:47:45.260 --> 01:47:47.260]  We're gonna win
[01:47:47.260 --> 01:47:49.260]  I'm telling you believe in Jesus Christ
[01:47:49.260 --> 01:47:51.260]  Everything's gonna be alright
[01:47:51.260 --> 01:47:55.260]  Everything's gonna be alright
[01:47:57.260 --> 01:47:59.260]  Wake up
[01:47:59.260 --> 01:48:01.260]  Wake up
[01:48:01.260 --> 01:48:03.260]  Pray the Lord your soul to keep
[01:48:03.260 --> 01:48:05.260]  Lord's prayer ladies and gentlemen
[01:48:07.260 --> 01:48:09.260]  Alright let's get into it
[01:48:09.260 --> 01:48:11.260]  I want to go to your phone calls
[01:48:11.260 --> 01:48:15.260]  And then the Google news is so huge
[01:48:15.260 --> 01:48:19.260]  The central bank is trying to plunge the economy is so unbelievably important
[01:48:19.260 --> 01:48:25.260]  But we've all been inflicted with we didn't elect Trump and we're all Russian agents
[01:48:25.260 --> 01:48:31.260]  For so long that it's important to just look at what a lie to trainwreck this is
[01:48:31.260 --> 01:48:33.260]  We've been doing that and we're taking your calls on it
[01:48:33.260 --> 01:48:37.260]  I went to the shooting range a few weeks ago with Robert Barnes
[01:48:37.260 --> 01:48:39.260]  It was fun shooting full auto
[01:48:39.260 --> 01:48:41.260]  I'm gonna air that in the first 15 minutes of the fourth hour that Mike Adams takes over
[01:48:41.260 --> 01:48:43.260]  Always does a great job
[01:48:43.260 --> 01:48:45.260]  And I've got to air at least a boil down
[01:48:45.260 --> 01:48:47.260]  This says 14 minutes
[01:48:47.260 --> 01:48:49.260]  So watch it this morning we boil it down
[01:48:49.260 --> 01:48:51.260]  It's also good though
[01:48:51.260 --> 01:48:53.260]  So important current senior Google engineer
[01:48:53.260 --> 01:48:55.260]  Goes public on camera
[01:48:55.260 --> 01:48:59.260]  This is a guy making a million bucks a year senior engineer
[01:48:59.260 --> 01:49:01.260]  And he's risking his job
[01:49:01.260 --> 01:49:03.260]  And violating his non-disclosure
[01:49:03.260 --> 01:49:05.260]  To tell the truth
[01:49:05.260 --> 01:49:09.260]  About how Google is gonna steal every future election
[01:49:09.260 --> 01:49:11.260]  And says they are
[01:49:11.260 --> 01:49:15.260]  And you're seeing this snowballing effect as more and more people come out
[01:49:15.260 --> 01:49:17.260]  It becomes easier for others to come out
[01:49:17.260 --> 01:49:19.260]  That's what leadership is
[01:49:19.260 --> 01:49:21.260]  But I don't want to be sitting here in 10 years
[01:49:21.260 --> 01:49:23.260]  People saying oh you were so right
[01:49:23.260 --> 01:49:25.260]  Oh you're such a hero and be invited to the White House
[01:49:25.260 --> 01:49:27.260]  By some future president
[01:49:27.260 --> 01:49:29.260]  I don't want that
[01:49:29.260 --> 01:49:31.260]  I want freedom for our children in the future
[01:49:31.260 --> 01:49:33.260]  And to secure the realm
[01:49:33.260 --> 01:49:35.260]  That's leadership
[01:49:35.260 --> 01:49:37.260]  So we have a chance to go to the stars and beyond
[01:49:37.260 --> 01:49:39.260]  I don't want
[01:49:39.260 --> 01:49:41.260]  Hollywood
[01:49:41.260 --> 01:49:43.260]  I don't want to be told how great I am in my time
[01:49:43.260 --> 01:49:45.260]  You're told you're great in your time
[01:49:45.260 --> 01:49:47.260]  When you're loved by the system you're bad
[01:49:47.260 --> 01:49:51.260]  When you're in a corrupt point in history like we are now
[01:49:51.260 --> 01:49:53.260]  I want to be an example
[01:49:53.260 --> 01:49:55.260]  And I'm surely not perfect
[01:49:55.260 --> 01:49:57.260]  Of standing up and doing right and winning
[01:49:57.260 --> 01:49:59.260]  But even if I get destroyed in the process
[01:49:59.260 --> 01:50:01.260]  We're going to win together
[01:50:01.260 --> 01:50:03.260]  And so that's still a win-win
[01:50:03.260 --> 01:50:05.260]  But I want people to get their mindset around that
[01:50:05.260 --> 01:50:07.260]  Because so many listeners come up and they say
[01:50:07.260 --> 01:50:09.260]  Oh Alex it's so terrible
[01:50:09.260 --> 01:50:11.260]  You know what they do to you
[01:50:11.260 --> 01:50:13.260]  And I say no, I'm actually fighting for my life and your life
[01:50:13.260 --> 01:50:15.260]  And I've had such a big effect
[01:50:15.260 --> 01:50:17.260]  Thanks to your support
[01:50:17.260 --> 01:50:19.260]  That we've changed the world
[01:50:19.260 --> 01:50:21.260]  And now they want to destroy us because we're effective
[01:50:21.260 --> 01:50:23.260]  And so really I just want to win
[01:50:23.260 --> 01:50:25.260]  And I kind of overheat
[01:50:25.260 --> 01:50:27.260]  I get so passionate about defeating the globalists
[01:50:27.260 --> 01:50:29.260]  That I get upset, I get angry
[01:50:29.260 --> 01:50:31.260]  With myself, my family
[01:50:31.260 --> 01:50:33.260]  The crew sometimes
[01:50:33.260 --> 01:50:35.260]  Because I get pissed reading all this
[01:50:35.260 --> 01:50:37.260]  And watching all this and knowing this
[01:50:37.260 --> 01:50:39.260]  And thinking it should be easier to defeat this
[01:50:39.260 --> 01:50:41.260]  So if listeners want to support us
[01:50:41.260 --> 01:50:43.260]  Keep me in the game
[01:50:43.260 --> 01:50:45.260]  Keep this operation in the game
[01:50:45.260 --> 01:50:47.260]  And all the covert things we've got going
[01:50:47.260 --> 01:50:49.260]  And some new things that will be announced soon
[01:50:49.260 --> 01:50:51.260]  We've been about a year behind
[01:50:51.260 --> 01:50:53.260]  In projects because of the attacks
[01:50:53.260 --> 01:50:55.260]  But so much stuff is on schedule
[01:50:55.260 --> 01:50:57.260]  Other things are behind
[01:50:57.260 --> 01:50:59.260]  There's a lot of stuff I can't tell you about
[01:50:59.260 --> 01:51:01.260]  Obviously with the platforming
[01:51:01.260 --> 01:51:03.260]  But the enemies got my phones tapped
[01:51:03.260 --> 01:51:05.260]  They know they are really pissed
[01:51:05.260 --> 01:51:07.260]  And trying to figure out how they can stop what we're doing
[01:51:07.260 --> 01:51:09.260]  Is working
[01:51:09.260 --> 01:51:11.260]  In a lot of great mysterious ways
[01:51:11.260 --> 01:51:13.260]  That I can't tell you
[01:51:13.260 --> 01:51:15.260]  Mysterious means you don't know quite the plan
[01:51:15.260 --> 01:51:17.260]  But somebody's got a plan
[01:51:17.260 --> 01:51:19.260]  And believe me it's going on
[01:51:19.260 --> 01:51:21.260]  Big time
[01:51:21.260 --> 01:51:23.260]  And I'm just
[01:51:23.260 --> 01:51:25.260]  We're so close to launching a lot of this
[01:51:25.260 --> 01:51:27.260]  A lot of it's already been launched
[01:51:27.260 --> 01:51:29.260]  We've got dead man switches in everything
[01:51:29.260 --> 01:51:31.260]  And so
[01:51:31.260 --> 01:51:33.260]  This is a big mojo
[01:51:33.260 --> 01:51:35.260]  Big medicine type stuff
[01:51:35.260 --> 01:51:37.260]  And it's simple things
[01:51:37.260 --> 01:51:39.260]  Like the left doesn't want you to wear American flags
[01:51:39.260 --> 01:51:41.260]  They hate Betsy Ross flags
[01:51:41.260 --> 01:51:43.260]  They hate Don't Tread on Me flags
[01:51:43.260 --> 01:51:45.260]  We just combined them all three together
[01:51:45.260 --> 01:51:47.260]  And that's the new limited edition shirt
[01:51:47.260 --> 01:51:49.260]  That we've sold half of
[01:51:49.260 --> 01:51:51.260]  Probably got another week of it or so
[01:51:51.260 --> 01:51:53.260]  And that that flag will be gone forever
[01:51:53.260 --> 01:51:55.260]  And the Betsy Ross
[01:51:55.260 --> 01:51:57.260]  These colors don't run was so popular
[01:51:57.260 --> 01:51:59.260]  It was limited edition
[01:51:59.260 --> 01:52:01.260]  We brought back another one that's similar
[01:52:01.260 --> 01:52:03.260]  But a new limited edition as well
[01:52:03.260 --> 01:52:05.260]  And the Betsy Ross flag above it
[01:52:05.260 --> 01:52:07.260]  Across the chest, nice navy blue shirt
[01:52:07.260 --> 01:52:09.260]  We have another, these colors don't run
[01:52:09.260 --> 01:52:11.260]  In blue and white
[01:52:11.260 --> 01:52:13.260]  And on the back it says America's back and forwards dot com
[01:52:13.260 --> 01:52:15.260]  So again
[01:52:15.260 --> 01:52:17.260]  It's a new variant, new designs
[01:52:17.260 --> 01:52:19.260]  And then we've got the, it's not really
[01:52:19.260 --> 01:52:21.260]  Chris Pratt inspired, I said our next
[01:52:21.260 --> 01:52:23.260]  Flags the Gatsun snake
[01:52:23.260 --> 01:52:25.260]  Over the American flag
[01:52:25.260 --> 01:52:27.260]  The Betsy Ross flag and Don't Tread on Me
[01:52:27.260 --> 01:52:29.260]  It makes perfect sense with somebody else that already made it
[01:52:29.260 --> 01:52:31.260]  It's just, like I said
[01:52:31.260 --> 01:52:33.260]  They've been at cheeseburgers in the U.S.
[01:52:33.260 --> 01:52:35.260]  Like in the World's Fair or something like
[01:52:35.260 --> 01:52:37.260]  It was like 1920
[01:52:37.260 --> 01:52:39.260]  Why have they been at cheeseburger before?
[01:52:39.260 --> 01:52:41.260]  Don't Tread on Me with the flag
[01:52:41.260 --> 01:52:43.260]  It just goes together because they're treading on the flag
[01:52:43.260 --> 01:52:45.260]  So we've got that shirt
[01:52:45.260 --> 01:52:47.260]  It's already sold out half
[01:52:47.260 --> 01:52:49.260]  And that helps fund this operation
[01:52:49.260 --> 01:52:51.260]  And some big stuff we're doing
[01:52:51.260 --> 01:52:53.260]  I'm running the patriot level
[01:52:53.260 --> 01:52:55.260]  Manhattan Project stuff
[01:52:55.260 --> 01:52:57.260]  And I know the enemy knows because some people involved have been threatened
[01:52:57.260 --> 01:52:59.260]  So that's why I went ahead and started telling you
[01:52:59.260 --> 01:53:01.260]  A few weeks ago
[01:53:01.260 --> 01:53:03.260]  That we've got
[01:53:03.260 --> 01:53:05.260]  Five big projects
[01:53:05.260 --> 01:53:07.260]  Two of them are done
[01:53:07.260 --> 01:53:09.260]  Others are nearing completion
[01:53:09.260 --> 01:53:11.260]  And there's other people running them
[01:53:11.260 --> 01:53:13.260]  And the White House knows about
[01:53:13.260 --> 01:53:15.260]  A lot of it and just
[01:53:15.260 --> 01:53:17.260]  Let's just say that we're pressing the attack
[01:53:17.260 --> 01:53:19.260]  As the President's told me to do
[01:53:19.260 --> 01:53:21.260]  I wouldn't need the President to tell me that
[01:53:21.260 --> 01:53:23.260]  I'm pressing the attack regardless
[01:53:23.260 --> 01:53:25.260]  Because I didn't go through all this to give up
[01:53:25.260 --> 01:53:27.260]  I'm not a loser and either are you
[01:53:27.260 --> 01:53:29.260]  No. 2 Word of Mouth
[01:53:29.260 --> 01:53:31.260]  Spread your email
[01:53:31.260 --> 01:53:33.260]  InfoWorst.com
[01:53:33.260 --> 01:53:35.260]  I see it all over YouTube now
[01:53:35.260 --> 01:53:37.260]  I'll be watching some other video about something else
[01:53:37.260 --> 01:53:39.260]  And it says, Alex Jones is still alive
[01:53:39.260 --> 01:53:41.260]  And he's in info wars.com
[01:53:43.260 --> 01:53:45.260]  And you see Senator Blumenthal going
[01:53:45.260 --> 01:53:47.260]  You released a monster
[01:53:47.260 --> 01:53:49.260]  It's a quote
[01:53:49.260 --> 01:53:51.260]  Now you've got to contain him
[01:53:51.260 --> 01:53:53.260]  We do not want him anywhere
[01:53:53.260 --> 01:53:55.260]  But they're like, sir, other people upload him
[01:53:55.260 --> 01:54:00.700]  I want to stop sir, we have AI about to do it.
[01:54:00.700 --> 01:54:03.580]  I mean, how outrageous is that?
[01:54:03.580 --> 01:54:05.980]  So again, I want to talk about ourselves, but we're at the center of this fight, so
[01:54:05.980 --> 01:54:14.620]  Kyle, Joshua, Jim, Carlos, Eli, David, Miguel, Julius, Joe, we will get to all of those calls
[01:54:14.620 --> 01:54:17.180]  at least and we will take your calls.
[01:54:17.180 --> 01:54:20.740]  But we have the DNA Force Plus is 50% off.
[01:54:20.740 --> 01:54:21.740]  It's amazing.
[01:54:21.740 --> 01:54:22.740]  Just research it for yourself.
[01:54:22.740 --> 01:54:25.300]  DNA Force Plus at m4swear.com.
[01:54:25.300 --> 01:54:29.100]  The supernal mentality is amazing, it's 50% off and a lot more, and that's how we fund
[01:54:29.100 --> 01:54:30.100]  this operation.
[01:54:30.100 --> 01:54:32.580]  So please want to thank you all that have supported us, want to encourage those that
[01:54:32.580 --> 01:54:36.780]  haven't gotten involved to go check it out, get a t-shirt, get a book, sign up for auto
[01:54:36.780 --> 01:54:40.460]  chip on things you're going to reorder like coffee, get an additional 10% off.
[01:54:40.460 --> 01:54:42.540]  Okay, let's do it right now.
[01:54:42.540 --> 01:54:44.060]  Let's start with callers here.
[01:54:44.060 --> 01:54:47.500]  I'm a day late to dollar short, but I'm getting to them.
[01:54:47.500 --> 01:54:49.860]  Let's talk to Kyle in Iowa.
[01:54:49.860 --> 01:54:50.860]  You're up front.
[01:54:50.860 --> 01:54:51.860]  Welcome, sir.
[01:54:51.860 --> 01:54:53.980]  How's it going, Alex?
[01:54:53.980 --> 01:54:57.540]  I got my mind running about a million miles a minute, so I'm going to try and encapsulate
[01:54:57.540 --> 01:54:58.540]  it.
[01:54:58.540 --> 01:54:59.540]  We're asking how I'm going.
[01:54:59.540 --> 01:55:03.580]  Look, we're winning right now, but let me tell you, the enemy's got a vicious right
[01:55:03.580 --> 01:55:05.500]  uppercut and I'm looking for that right now.
[01:55:05.500 --> 01:55:06.500]  Go ahead.
[01:55:06.500 --> 01:55:07.500]  Yeah.
[01:55:07.500 --> 01:55:08.500]  Okay.
[01:55:08.500 --> 01:55:14.060]  So I had a point I want to call on and I'm going to encapsulate that, but I also have
[01:55:14.060 --> 01:55:17.620]  a precautionary thing for people on the right and Trump on the back end.
[01:55:17.620 --> 01:55:21.100]  I want to kind of piggyback that out of what I was going to say, but I think everything
[01:55:21.100 --> 01:55:28.260]  that's happening with the Russian collusion investigation, all this stuff, all this stuff
[01:55:28.260 --> 01:55:35.540]  plus everything that's happening in social media and the social sphere, I think it's
[01:55:35.540 --> 01:55:39.020]  almost overtly ridiculous, and I think that's almost on purpose.
[01:55:39.020 --> 01:55:42.020]  And I think the reason for that is twofold.
[01:55:42.020 --> 01:55:49.460]  First, I think the establishment wants to maybe gauge how effective their kind of programming
[01:55:49.460 --> 01:55:54.740]  is from the Prussian model of education and all these other aspects that they've...
[01:55:54.740 --> 01:55:55.740]  Sure.
[01:55:55.740 --> 01:55:57.180]  America's being given a choice.
[01:55:57.180 --> 01:55:58.180]  Yeah.
[01:55:58.180 --> 01:55:59.180]  Yeah.
[01:55:59.180 --> 01:56:04.260]  So I think they want to see how effective they've been by running a lot of these, by flying
[01:56:04.260 --> 01:56:10.460]  a lot of these test balloons, but also be to add so much static, so much background noise
[01:56:10.460 --> 01:56:17.220]  and have things be so overtly ridiculous that it gets people amped up and at each other's
[01:56:17.220 --> 01:56:23.260]  throats so that we're, that way, we're not paying attention to what the actual establishment
[01:56:23.260 --> 01:56:24.780]  is trying to do.
[01:56:24.780 --> 01:56:27.620]  Rolling out 5G, rolling out brain chips, stuff like that.
[01:56:27.620 --> 01:56:28.620]  Right.
[01:56:28.620 --> 01:56:29.620]  Yeah, yeah, all of it.
[01:56:29.620 --> 01:56:30.620]  All of it.
[01:56:30.620 --> 01:56:31.620]  Let me say this though.
[01:56:31.620 --> 01:56:33.820]  You're a smart and informed guy, so you kind of have a blind spot.
[01:56:33.820 --> 01:56:38.900]  You think, oh, this is so over the top, this is meant to cause a right-wing revolution.
[01:56:38.900 --> 01:56:39.900]  No.
[01:56:39.900 --> 01:56:42.540]  The left's dumbest all over the world, and they've taken over with, hey, everything's
[01:56:42.540 --> 01:56:46.100]  going to be free and all this, so you have to understand there's a dumbed-down groups
[01:56:46.100 --> 01:56:51.660]  of people that are buying all this, so I think you underestimate the fact that raw, bigger
[01:56:51.660 --> 01:56:55.740]  the lie, the bigger they believe it, raw propaganda is what the globalists have gone to out of
[01:56:55.740 --> 01:56:56.740]  panic.
[01:56:56.740 --> 01:57:01.420]  They were trying the creeping manipulation, and that failed, so they go, okay, try this
[01:57:01.420 --> 01:57:03.020]  instead of giving up, you see?
[01:57:03.020 --> 01:57:05.380]  Yeah, no, no, I totally agree with that.
[01:57:05.380 --> 01:57:07.180]  I think there's a lot of different moving parts to it.
[01:57:07.180 --> 01:57:09.620]  I think you have the folks that are more...
[01:57:09.620 --> 01:57:13.220]  I mean, Ilhan Omar and AOC hate this country.
[01:57:13.220 --> 01:57:14.620]  They can't help themselves.
[01:57:14.620 --> 01:57:15.620]  Right, right.
[01:57:15.620 --> 01:57:16.620]  They're kind of a misfire.
[01:57:16.620 --> 01:57:22.220]  They're kind of like, you know, in swimming or running, somebody jumps the line.
[01:57:22.220 --> 01:57:24.820]  That's all they're doing is they're false starting.
[01:57:24.820 --> 01:57:28.060]  They're like, whoa, whoa, whoa, they're not supposed to know we're going to take their
[01:57:28.060 --> 01:57:33.180]  kids and their guns and let pitos rape their children, and they're like, whoa, whoa, whoa,
[01:57:33.180 --> 01:57:34.180]  whoa, whoa.
[01:57:34.180 --> 01:57:37.580]  Hold on, I want you to finish up what you think we're not talking about or what you think
[01:57:37.580 --> 01:57:39.900]  we're being diverted from, because I think that's an important question.
[01:57:39.900 --> 01:57:40.900]  Kyle, stay there.
[01:57:40.900 --> 01:57:42.900]  Back in two minutes with Joshua and everybody else.
[01:57:42.900 --> 01:57:43.900]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:57:43.900 --> 01:57:47.140]  This is the Info World.
[01:57:47.140 --> 01:57:51.340]  The globalists are hyper-competitive scientific dictators.
[01:57:51.340 --> 01:57:52.380]  They are technocrats.
[01:57:52.380 --> 01:57:56.180]  They are control freaks in their own words, and they believe allowing you to live your
[01:57:56.180 --> 01:58:00.700]  own life and make your own decisions gets to the way of their great destiny to merge
[01:58:00.700 --> 01:58:01.700]  with AI gods.
[01:58:01.700 --> 01:58:03.940]  Now, we're fighting them hard in cyberspace.
[01:58:03.940 --> 01:58:07.580]  We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension, but one of the biggest places
[01:58:07.580 --> 01:58:12.860]  that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.
[01:58:12.860 --> 01:58:18.100]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from Forre's Life.com, I couldn't do it.
[01:58:18.100 --> 01:58:22.460]  That's why we decided to take our original Secret 12 that was incredibly high quality
[01:58:22.460 --> 01:58:28.180]  Methylcobalamin and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12.
[01:58:28.180 --> 01:58:32.980]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12 over the counter that you're
[01:58:32.980 --> 01:58:33.980]  going to find anywhere.
[01:58:33.980 --> 01:58:39.260]  It is amazing, experience pure Methylcobalamin B12 for yourself, and fund the second American
[01:58:39.260 --> 01:58:46.900]  Revolution against the tyrants at infowarsstore.com, infowarslife.com, or AAA-253-3139.
[01:59:17.900 --> 01:59:20.660]  I agree entirely, and the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying
[01:59:20.660 --> 01:59:23.580]  to shut you down, but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[01:59:23.580 --> 01:59:27.380]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old, I would love to see what you're
[01:59:27.380 --> 01:59:31.420]  talking about when you're 80, but if they do shut you down, no, you've gone into this
[01:59:31.420 --> 01:59:36.620]  war, you've won a lot of battles, and there are a lot of people like myself and many others
[01:59:36.620 --> 01:59:40.780]  who are gonna continue, we're gonna keep fighting in the info war, and even if something does
[01:59:40.780 --> 01:59:45.500]  happen to you or your show, know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up
[01:59:45.500 --> 01:59:46.500]  for liberty.
[01:59:46.500 --> 02:00:14.380]  I'm sure for calling.
[02:00:46.860 --> 02:00:50.020]  Trump is Godzilla, wrecking ball to the globalists.
[02:00:50.020 --> 02:00:59.740]  We're finishing up with Kyle in Iowa, you're saying, what is the distraction for?
[02:00:59.740 --> 02:01:03.780]  The globalists are radicalizing their base, they want a violent revolution, and it's worked
[02:01:03.780 --> 02:01:06.500]  everywhere else, and so they're trying to execute it.
[02:01:06.500 --> 02:01:12.860]  I've really looked into this, and Soros and others think they've got so much power, they've
[02:01:12.860 --> 02:01:19.940]  never been brought to heal, that psychopaths always then begin to try to get caught at
[02:01:19.940 --> 02:01:24.780]  a subconscious level, because even though the spirit that's in them, and their cerebral
[02:01:24.780 --> 02:01:30.700]  cortex is tearing out evil, their subconscious physical body wants to kill them, George Soros
[02:01:30.700 --> 02:01:35.500]  wants to kill himself, Alexander Soros wants to die, I don't wish any harm upon them other
[02:01:35.500 --> 02:01:40.580]  than the super max president if they're convicted, and so Rico investigations have already begun,
[02:01:40.580 --> 02:01:44.260]  Ted Cruz is talking about it, of anti-fossil terror group, what about who funds them, I
[02:01:44.260 --> 02:01:49.260]  have the documents, I'll show it next segment, but you're saying, what is this distracting
[02:01:49.260 --> 02:01:53.860]  from, you know, to look at people like day of the dead zombies believing there's concentration
[02:01:53.860 --> 02:01:59.300]  camps that kids are drinking out of toilets, no one got in trouble for lying about that,
[02:01:59.300 --> 02:02:05.220]  and so the next whopper is going to be bigger, okay, and so this is kind of going over the
[02:02:05.220 --> 02:02:09.860]  edge of a cliff in my view, is what I see happening, what do you think?
[02:02:09.860 --> 02:02:14.900]  Yeah, okay, so I want to dial it back just really quick, and like I said, because I think
[02:02:14.900 --> 02:02:19.100]  what I thought of after I called in, I think I have a almost a more important point about
[02:02:19.100 --> 02:02:21.620]  Sure, I'm not screening your call, you're live on air, so go ahead.
[02:02:21.620 --> 02:02:26.140]  No, no, no, no, no, no, gotcha, I wasn't accusing you of that, so just to dial it back, whenever
[02:02:26.140 --> 02:02:32.340]  I think about it, or whenever I analyze what's kind of happening in the meta, if you will,
[02:02:32.340 --> 02:02:36.140]  of what's happening, I always try and think about it like, okay, you got, you got possibility
[02:02:36.140 --> 02:02:40.340]  A, and why is this happening, and then you got possibility B, so I agree with all the
[02:02:40.340 --> 02:02:43.780]  points you made, that's just what I want to say, but I was trying to kind of think of
[02:02:43.780 --> 02:02:49.620]  like, okay, well what if this is the case, now to the distraction, I think the important
[02:02:49.620 --> 02:02:55.220]  thing is, is kind of like when you are test smelling cologne and you got to smell the coffee
[02:02:55.220 --> 02:03:00.660]  beans to kind of reset your senses a little bit, they've been ratcheting up all this so
[02:03:00.660 --> 02:03:06.660]  much that I think sometimes you got to kind of dial yourself back and say, kind of go
[02:03:06.660 --> 02:03:09.900]  back to square one and be like, what is it, what are they trying to, what's their end
[02:03:09.900 --> 02:03:14.340]  game, what are they trying to do, and you've done a good job over the years of spelling,
[02:03:14.340 --> 02:03:18.500]  spelling that out, you and some others are saying, hey, this is what the elite establishment
[02:03:18.500 --> 02:03:24.660]  wants to do, so we know they want a 1984 type control grid system, they, you know, they
[02:03:24.660 --> 02:03:28.820]  want to have, you know, a cashless society, or basically a way that they can control
[02:03:28.820 --> 02:03:31.540]  the flow of current... Sure, and Trump is not going up against
[02:03:31.540 --> 02:03:35.380]  that right now, first he's got to get control of the country, launch a bunch of the secret
[02:03:35.380 --> 02:03:40.100]  technologies, and change the flow of debate from the technocracy they want to build to
[02:03:40.100 --> 02:03:44.940]  a bunch of innovative technologies that break out of the Trojan horse model we have, we're
[02:03:44.940 --> 02:03:50.500]  only given limited systems that dehumanize us, instead really open up the full potential
[02:03:50.500 --> 02:03:54.420]  for everybody, and then folks can actually make the real decision about what they want
[02:03:54.420 --> 02:04:00.060]  to do, but not have a technocracy, meaning global technological dictatorship directing
[02:04:00.060 --> 02:04:02.500]  the technological development, does that make sense?
[02:04:02.500 --> 02:04:07.220]  Yeah, yeah, no, it makes, it makes absolute sense, and it's just, everything you're doing
[02:04:07.220 --> 02:04:10.620]  I think is really just a distraction from them putting these things in place, because
[02:04:10.620 --> 02:04:15.060]  I saw, I saw a deal where they're implanting people with microchips, I think in Australia,
[02:04:15.060 --> 02:04:17.580]  I know they've been doing that for a while... Companies are doing it everywhere, Sweden
[02:04:17.580 --> 02:04:23.220]  says, free buses if you take chips, I mean come on folks, this is, this is all for total
[02:04:23.220 --> 02:04:26.980]  control, because if they can get you to take a chip, next you'll take a brain wiring, and
[02:04:26.980 --> 02:04:30.140]  it's, it's, it's, you know, oh they'll never have chips, now it's hell, we're going to
[02:04:30.140 --> 02:04:33.500]  have chips, we're only going to have wires in our brains, now I just spent two segments
[02:04:33.500 --> 02:04:36.780]  with that caller, that's okay, he's a great caller, but I've got to move quicker, I'll
[02:04:36.780 --> 02:04:42.140]  never get to Joshua Jim, Carlos, Eli, and so many others on the other side, so bam,
[02:04:42.140 --> 02:04:46.500]  bam, bam, we're back in 60 seconds, remember them, we're electrochemical, we're not machines,
[02:04:46.500 --> 02:04:51.500]  and you can spread the links to infowars.com and newswars.com and circumvent the sensors,
[02:04:51.500 --> 02:04:56.380]  counting on you not realizing the power you have.
[02:04:56.380 --> 02:05:01.860]  Before I started working at infowars, I was not only a fan of Alex Jones and infowars.com,
[02:05:01.860 --> 02:05:06.300]  but also the products at infowarsstore.com, and there's one product that's offered at
[02:05:06.300 --> 02:05:11.740]  infowarsstore.com that is the elite of the supplements, and that's DNA Force Plus.
[02:05:11.740 --> 02:05:15.780]  Now I remember when Alex first started talking about this with some of his special guests,
[02:05:15.780 --> 02:05:20.940]  telomeres, and telomere support with your DNA, and so I started to look into the science
[02:05:20.940 --> 02:05:27.180]  and what telomeres were, and how it can improve your health and longevity when you protect
[02:05:27.180 --> 02:05:31.880]  your telomeres, so I started looking into DNA Force Plus, but it's expensive, why?
[02:05:31.880 --> 02:05:36.740]  Because it is an elite supplement, and then I started seeing other competitors coming
[02:05:36.740 --> 02:05:41.820]  up with competitive supplements for telomere support, and they came and they went, but
[02:05:41.820 --> 02:05:48.060]  DNA Force Plus is still there, it is the elite supplement, I get excited when DNA Force Plus
[02:05:48.060 --> 02:05:53.540]  is on sale because I know it's expensive, so you should take advantage of 50% off DNA
[02:05:53.540 --> 02:06:19.060]  Force Plus at infowarsstore.com.
[02:06:19.060 --> 02:06:28.000]  Thank you.
[02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:29.520]  All right let's go boom, boom, boom for your calls.
[02:06:29.520 --> 02:06:31.020]  What did you think of the testimony today?
[02:06:31.020 --> 02:06:33.280]  I thought it was off the rails.
[02:06:33.280 --> 02:06:36.820]  Mueller looked like he was having basically Alzheimer's.
[02:06:36.820 --> 02:06:40.140]  He was lying about public events that are known to have occurred.
[02:06:40.140 --> 02:06:41.140]  It was a fiasco.
[02:06:41.140 --> 02:06:44.140]  It's not what the Democrats were hoping for, but they're going to declare victory like
[02:06:44.140 --> 02:06:47.260]  they always do, but how are they going to sucker punch us while they want to try to
[02:06:47.260 --> 02:06:52.380]  implode the economy, and still the election with Google and Facebook manipulating who
[02:06:52.380 --> 02:06:57.020]  gets alerts and things in search requests, and that's all coming out as well.
[02:06:57.020 --> 02:07:01.900]  Another huge executive at Google has gone public saying, oh they've totally chosen sides,
[02:07:01.900 --> 02:07:07.340]  they're engaged in fraud, Congress must act, the president must act, so that's all coming
[02:07:07.340 --> 02:07:09.340]  up today.
[02:07:09.340 --> 02:07:13.820]  Joshua, in New Jersey, you're on the air, thanks for holding.
[02:07:13.820 --> 02:07:15.820]  Mr. Jones, it's a pleasure.
[02:07:15.820 --> 02:07:17.820]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[02:07:17.820 --> 02:07:24.060]  At first, I gotta say, I use the X2, the X3, the Ultra 12.
[02:07:24.060 --> 02:07:25.700]  I love them all.
[02:07:25.700 --> 02:07:28.100]  Make me feel incredible.
[02:07:28.100 --> 02:07:33.180]  What I saw there today from the little snippets I saw, that man is definitely withdrawing
[02:07:33.180 --> 02:07:34.580]  from something.
[02:07:34.580 --> 02:07:41.940]  I think when Trump shut down this child sex trafficking as much as he has, all of them
[02:07:41.940 --> 02:07:43.900]  look like they're going to withdraws.
[02:07:43.900 --> 02:07:50.580]  They're Cuomo, Pelosi, I think they're just trying to distract us from, like you said,
[02:07:50.580 --> 02:07:51.580]  if Google decides to.
[02:07:51.580 --> 02:07:57.980]  By the way, what you just said sounds fantastical, but if you study Adrenochrome, which is a
[02:07:57.980 --> 02:08:03.180]  real drug, and Google admits it's real, that the royal families and others have been caught,
[02:08:03.180 --> 02:08:06.900]  I was told this 20 years ago, it came out in the Jimmy Savelle story, that they would
[02:08:06.900 --> 02:08:11.340]  go in and get the pituitary glands of children at the morgue, and he would bring them to
[02:08:11.340 --> 02:08:12.340]  Prince Charles.
[02:08:12.340 --> 02:08:16.180]  And so, yes, these people are obsessed with eating children's pituitary glands.
[02:08:16.180 --> 02:08:19.460]  And it's funny you say that, because Hillary and all of them aren't in the power structure
[02:08:19.460 --> 02:08:23.660]  anymore, but they want unaccompanied kids who they admitted are kidnapped and killed.
[02:08:23.660 --> 02:08:27.580]  We know there's organ harvesting going on as well, and they want babies to be kept alive
[02:08:27.580 --> 02:08:28.580]  and all the rest of it.
[02:08:28.580 --> 02:08:32.780]  And it's just, we have to say that's in the realm of possibility, because that's literally
[02:08:32.780 --> 02:08:33.780]  who these people are.
[02:08:33.780 --> 02:08:35.780]  So, I mean, is that what you're saying?
[02:08:35.780 --> 02:08:40.420]  Yeah, well, being up here in Jersey, I mean, I'm out of South Carolina, and I'm up here
[02:08:40.420 --> 02:08:47.540]  working with a friend of mine, and the people up here, there are some very smart ones.
[02:08:47.540 --> 02:08:52.100]  And then there are people that are just completely overtly dumb, I mean, I've got a driver that
[02:08:52.100 --> 02:08:57.020]  works with me, and he's got no teeth, and he swears that, well, I'm good for your teeth.
[02:08:57.020 --> 02:09:01.340]  I said, but you have no teeth, and it's in your water, at your house.
[02:09:01.340 --> 02:09:04.460]  I was good for your teeth, and they just don't get it.
[02:09:04.460 --> 02:09:09.660]  And I think, you know, there's a saying, every day we wake up and we fall further from the
[02:09:09.660 --> 02:09:11.220]  grace of God.
[02:09:11.220 --> 02:09:15.140]  I think you're right, man, we've got to get back to the roots here and get back to God
[02:09:15.140 --> 02:09:16.140]  and country.
[02:09:16.140 --> 02:09:17.140]  Oh, it's crazy.
[02:09:17.140 --> 02:09:20.580]  The closer you get to God, and I'm not saying I'm on some holy man or an Ihor's, but the
[02:09:20.580 --> 02:09:24.660]  closer you get to God, the more knowledge you get, the more understanding, I mean, the
[02:09:24.660 --> 02:09:27.660]  intelligence level, it's just the piercing understanding.
[02:09:27.660 --> 02:09:30.860]  And then you go around people that serve evil, they're stupid there.
[02:09:30.860 --> 02:09:35.340]  They're like robots, and they just, they just sputter around like demons.
[02:09:35.340 --> 02:09:36.340]  God bless you.
[02:09:36.340 --> 02:09:37.340]  I appreciate your call.
[02:09:37.340 --> 02:09:42.060]  Jim in Colorado, Jim, you're on the air, thanks for calling on this amazing day.
[02:09:42.060 --> 02:09:43.060]  Hi, Alex.
[02:09:43.060 --> 02:09:44.060]  How are you doing?
[02:09:44.060 --> 02:09:45.060]  I'm good, brother.
[02:09:45.060 --> 02:09:52.780]  Well, first off, let me say what Gerald Salente said on the last part of your show yesterday
[02:09:52.780 --> 02:09:56.020]  almost brought tears to my eyes because I identify with that totally.
[02:09:56.020 --> 02:10:00.620]  I'm not for the Republicans any more than I'm against the Democrats.
[02:10:00.620 --> 02:10:06.420]  I think the whole thing is rotten from the top to the bottom, and I'm extremely disappointed
[02:10:06.420 --> 02:10:09.460]  in Trump, extremely disappointed in the man.
[02:10:09.460 --> 02:10:11.540]  He promised he was going to have Hillary arrested.
[02:10:11.540 --> 02:10:15.100]  If you're not going to have her arrested, who are you going to go after?
[02:10:15.100 --> 02:10:21.500]  There's just overwhelming evidence of not only criminality, but treason, the Bush administration.
[02:10:21.500 --> 02:10:25.300]  My God, if you're not going to have those people arrested for war crimes, who are you
[02:10:25.300 --> 02:10:26.300]  going to go after?
[02:10:26.300 --> 02:10:30.620]  No, but you understand the argument is that he's up there in D.C. with all these scumbag
[02:10:30.620 --> 02:10:35.900]  lawyers and all these establishment people that sold the country out, and if Trump tries
[02:10:35.900 --> 02:10:40.460]  to go after them all, they'll really sabotage the government and the country.
[02:10:40.460 --> 02:10:43.940]  My argument is they're already doing it, might as well do it, but the Justice Department
[02:10:43.940 --> 02:10:50.380]  is so full at the top of sycophantic yes men and just a bunch of people that are in love
[02:10:50.380 --> 02:10:55.620]  with themselves, all the white shoe boys, white shoe boys, not white shoe boys like
[02:10:55.620 --> 02:11:01.580]  the news said, white shoe boys who literally are so arrogant and so stupid and so insulated
[02:11:01.580 --> 02:11:04.260]  and so insular that they don't know what they're doing.
[02:11:04.260 --> 02:11:07.780]  I mean, I just, Trump can't get the funding for the border wall.
[02:11:07.780 --> 02:11:11.740]  He got emergency funding and the border patrol said, fix the areas that are already broken.
[02:11:11.740 --> 02:11:12.740]  That's the main point.
[02:11:12.740 --> 02:11:13.740]  He did what they want.
[02:11:13.740 --> 02:11:17.700]  Oh, Trump didn't build any wall or, you know, Trump, like I'm mad at Trump about not going
[02:11:17.700 --> 02:11:23.020]  after vaccines, 5G super bad news from a surveillance and health perspective.
[02:11:23.020 --> 02:11:26.700]  He is pulling us out of Afghanistan, pulls us out of Syria, trying to make peace stills
[02:11:26.700 --> 02:11:28.340]  in North Korea.
[02:11:28.340 --> 02:11:32.300]  Two good Supreme Court justices compared to what Hillary would have done, massive amounts
[02:11:32.300 --> 02:11:33.300]  of new jobs.
[02:11:33.300 --> 02:11:36.060]  I mean, he's definitely rooting for America.
[02:11:36.060 --> 02:11:38.900]  So I just don't get like, I mean, I run my own company.
[02:11:38.900 --> 02:11:40.060]  I've got an amazing crew.
[02:11:40.060 --> 02:11:41.060]  Best crew I've ever had.
[02:11:41.060 --> 02:11:42.060]  Okay.
[02:11:42.060 --> 02:11:43.060]  But it takes time to get stuff done.
[02:11:43.060 --> 02:11:44.060]  We have problems.
[02:11:44.060 --> 02:11:46.380]  Stuff gets messed up and they're not working against me.
[02:11:46.380 --> 02:11:47.380]  They're working against me.
[02:11:47.380 --> 02:11:48.540]  We would be shut down in a week.
[02:11:48.540 --> 02:11:49.540]  Okay.
[02:11:49.540 --> 02:11:50.540]  Trump has people working against him.
[02:11:50.540 --> 02:11:54.100]  I don't know how the hell he is supposed to magically do all this.
[02:11:54.100 --> 02:11:55.900]  I'm just being reality based.
[02:11:55.900 --> 02:11:58.100]  Can I, can I make a suggestion?
[02:11:58.100 --> 02:11:59.100]  Yes, sir.
[02:11:59.100 --> 02:12:00.100]  Please.
[02:12:00.100 --> 02:12:03.860]  My father had this exact conversation that you and I have gone through and my dad said
[02:12:03.860 --> 02:12:04.860]  the same thing you did.
[02:12:04.860 --> 02:12:08.820]  He said, he's afraid of triggering a civil war or he can't get the support for what
[02:12:08.820 --> 02:12:09.820]  he needs to do.
[02:12:09.820 --> 02:12:14.780]  But let me tell you this, there's still a lot of good Christian right wing people in
[02:12:14.780 --> 02:12:18.060]  this country who believe, I'm not talking about Republicans, I'm talking about right
[02:12:18.060 --> 02:12:19.060]  wing.
[02:12:19.060 --> 02:12:20.980]  No, I know if there's a war we're going to win, but we're going to, about 20 million
[02:12:20.980 --> 02:12:21.980]  people are going to die.
[02:12:21.980 --> 02:12:24.460]  Are you ready for that?
[02:12:24.460 --> 02:12:29.220]  Any day for 20 million people to show up with their second amendment right arms in their
[02:12:29.220 --> 02:12:34.900]  hands and start this country anew because if we don't, we're going to be on the short
[02:12:34.900 --> 02:12:35.900]  end of the stick when he's done that.
[02:12:35.900 --> 02:12:38.740]  GM, I agree and we're going down that road right now.
[02:12:38.740 --> 02:12:40.860]  That's what's coming, Allison.
[02:12:40.860 --> 02:12:41.860]  He knows that.
[02:12:41.860 --> 02:12:42.860]  He knows that.
[02:12:42.860 --> 02:12:43.860]  He's not a stupid man.
[02:12:43.860 --> 02:12:44.860]  I've watched the guy for a long time.
[02:12:44.860 --> 02:12:45.860]  No, Trump does know that.
[02:12:45.860 --> 02:12:49.020]  He's, let me tell you something, Trump's ready to call out the military and everything.
[02:12:49.020 --> 02:12:50.740]  He just has to make sure the people are with him.
[02:12:50.740 --> 02:12:52.420]  He wants to try to fix this the right way.
[02:12:52.420 --> 02:12:53.860]  Believe me, Trump's not giving up.
[02:12:53.860 --> 02:12:56.060]  Let me tell you, there's a good chance they're going to kill him.
[02:12:56.060 --> 02:12:57.060]  You know that, right?
[02:12:57.060 --> 02:13:02.220]  Well, let's see, if he's really against them, then yes, but in my view, this thing is all
[02:13:02.220 --> 02:13:03.700]  in a elaborate bruise.
[02:13:03.700 --> 02:13:06.860]  I mean, listen, you heard the last caller hitting at that.
[02:13:06.860 --> 02:13:09.300]  You think this real conniption fit?
[02:13:09.300 --> 02:13:12.700]  Let me tell you, I've been attacked before Trump got in.
[02:13:12.700 --> 02:13:14.220]  The attacks have been a hundred times worse.
[02:13:14.220 --> 02:13:16.780]  Let me tell you, Trump's taken power from them.
[02:13:16.780 --> 02:13:20.100]  Now maybe he's some other group and could be bad.
[02:13:20.100 --> 02:13:23.820]  My gut doesn't say that, but let me tell you, he's taken the power away from the deep state
[02:13:23.820 --> 02:13:26.820]  that hijacked this country and sold us out of the chicoms.
[02:13:26.820 --> 02:13:31.060]  Let me tell you something, they are legitimately getting their asses removed right now.
[02:13:31.060 --> 02:13:32.980]  That's why they're so pissed, brother.
[02:13:32.980 --> 02:13:39.860]  So we can sit back here and watch Trump up there and then wonder why we're not being,
[02:13:39.860 --> 02:13:41.940]  you know, delivered out of this quicker.
[02:13:41.940 --> 02:13:42.940]  He's just the president.
[02:13:42.940 --> 02:13:44.700]  He's not a dictator.
[02:13:44.700 --> 02:13:50.140]  And they have created so many snot-nosed America-hating pills in this country that really believe
[02:13:50.140 --> 02:13:51.140]  all this crap.
[02:13:51.140 --> 02:13:55.220]  That's why they hand out Play-Doh and coloring books at colleges.
[02:13:55.220 --> 02:14:00.100]  I saw a Constitution, they go, come in here and they have little tables that are foot
[02:14:00.100 --> 02:14:03.580]  high and full-grown adults sit there and play with Play-Doh.
[02:14:03.580 --> 02:14:08.340]  A third of our country plays with Play-Doh and lives off mommy and daddy's money.
[02:14:08.340 --> 02:14:12.140]  So you're probably a hard-working guy as a family.
[02:14:12.140 --> 02:14:16.100]  You just are disconnected from that, so you don't realize how many blobs there are.
[02:14:16.100 --> 02:14:18.700]  Do you have any idea how many blobs there are, Jim?
[02:14:18.700 --> 02:14:21.180]  Oh, Alex, I'm very well educated.
[02:14:21.180 --> 02:14:22.380]  I've lived all over the world.
[02:14:22.380 --> 02:14:25.900]  I now live up in deep in the mountains because I know it's coming.
[02:14:25.900 --> 02:14:28.260]  I no longer live around large populations.
[02:14:28.260 --> 02:14:29.820]  Believe me, I wish I was with you.
[02:14:29.820 --> 02:14:31.820]  Listen, listen, I would cut bait now.
[02:14:31.820 --> 02:14:34.860]  I didn't think we have a chance to turn this around, but let me tell you, I'm eyeballing
[02:14:34.860 --> 02:14:37.220]  my family's escape every day now.
[02:14:37.220 --> 02:14:39.060]  I've never been out of the shooting range every week.
[02:14:39.060 --> 02:14:43.300]  I've never been looking at redoubts in Idaho or places or Montana.
[02:14:43.300 --> 02:14:47.700]  Brother, we've got the escape pods ready, okay?
[02:14:47.700 --> 02:14:50.260]  So I understand how bad you think this is.
[02:14:50.260 --> 02:14:54.180]  Believe me, buddy, I've got the escape pods warming up right now, but I'm going to stay
[02:14:54.180 --> 02:14:57.740]  on this ship myself and get the family out because we've got to have rear-guard actions
[02:14:57.740 --> 02:14:59.100]  if this thing goes sideways.
[02:14:59.100 --> 02:15:02.060]  I just want all the snot-nosed people out there to know something too, and I think this show
[02:15:02.060 --> 02:15:03.260]  is funny.
[02:15:03.260 --> 02:15:04.740]  You've lived in a free country a long time.
[02:15:04.740 --> 02:15:05.740]  You've pissed all over it.
[02:15:05.740 --> 02:15:07.980]  You have no idea what you're open the door for.
[02:15:07.980 --> 02:15:08.980]  I appreciate your call.
[02:15:08.980 --> 02:15:10.380]  Do you have anything else you want to add?
[02:15:10.380 --> 02:15:12.380]  Let me just hang up.
[02:15:12.380 --> 02:15:14.740]  I just spent another whole other segment with two callers.
[02:15:14.740 --> 02:15:17.660]  I got to move quicker because I got a bunch of clips I got to get to, and I promised to
[02:15:17.660 --> 02:15:22.060]  get to these E-Line, Kentucky, and Carlos, and David, and Miguel, and Julius, and Joe.
[02:15:22.060 --> 02:15:23.980]  Your calls are coming up.
[02:15:23.980 --> 02:15:26.540]  You don't think I don't want to be on a hundred acres.
[02:15:26.540 --> 02:15:32.380]  We're 50 miles from a town with my woman, my kids, and the dogs, and me.
[02:15:32.380 --> 02:15:33.380]  Oh, my God.
[02:15:33.380 --> 02:15:40.420]  I just have dreams about a Bronco and my dear rifle, and a garden, and just getting out
[02:15:40.420 --> 02:15:41.420]  of all this.
[02:15:41.420 --> 02:15:44.300]  But we can't do it because they'll hunt us down there.
[02:15:44.300 --> 02:15:48.060]  We built civilization to defeat tyranny, and we're going to continue it, and we're going
[02:15:48.060 --> 02:15:49.060]  off world.
[02:15:49.060 --> 02:15:51.700]  The next level will be achieved.
[02:15:51.700 --> 02:15:52.700]  Hold fast.
[02:15:52.700 --> 02:15:56.060]  We're going to win.
[02:15:56.060 --> 02:16:01.860]  When you have a pain in the neck, a real pain in the neck, back, shoulder, or legs, you

[02:16:55.300 --> 02:17:00.500]  Fellow Patriots, my name is Todd Savage, founder of Black Rifle Real Estate.com.
[02:17:00.500 --> 02:17:04.420]  Like you, I was a prisoner of the out left sanctuary state until one day I chose to leave
[02:17:04.420 --> 02:17:05.900]  my family to freedom.

[02:17:53.620 --> 02:17:54.620]  Alex.
[02:17:54.620 --> 02:17:55.620]  Yes.
[02:17:55.620 --> 02:17:59.620]  I got a plug for the Patriot points I get.
[02:17:59.620 --> 02:18:00.620]  Oh, thanks.
[02:18:00.620 --> 02:18:03.580]  I got $180 so far this year and I feel like I'm stealing from you.
[02:18:03.580 --> 02:18:06.780]  I buy so much in the store because I mean, I don't want to get that money to Walmart.
[02:18:06.780 --> 02:18:09.460]  I don't want to give that money to people who are going to donate it to causes I don't
[02:18:09.460 --> 02:18:10.460]  believe in.
[02:18:10.460 --> 02:18:11.460]  So I'd rather give that money to you.
[02:18:11.460 --> 02:18:15.180]  And then getting quality products, the products that I do receive have changed my life.
[02:18:15.180 --> 02:18:17.540]  I mean, the X2 has really done a lot for me.
[02:18:17.540 --> 02:18:18.540]  I've lost weight.
[02:18:18.540 --> 02:18:20.020]  My brain works a whole lot better.
[02:18:20.020 --> 02:18:21.820]  My kids, they use the toothpaste.
[02:18:21.820 --> 02:18:25.980]  My son used to get these little sore throats and he puts X2 in water and drinks it and
[02:18:25.980 --> 02:18:26.980]  it gets rid of his sore throat.
[02:18:26.980 --> 02:18:29.060]  Well, sir, let me break this down for you.
[02:18:29.060 --> 02:18:30.540]  I want high quality stuff in there.
[02:18:30.540 --> 02:18:31.540]  I want a good price.
[02:18:31.540 --> 02:18:35.740]  But I've kind of habituated everybody to where everybody buys when it's 50% off.
[02:18:35.740 --> 02:18:38.140]  I'm making $2 on the toothpaste, 50% off.
[02:18:38.140 --> 02:18:41.580]  And so it's the same thing like the fish oil or the turmeric or the bone broth.
[02:18:41.580 --> 02:18:42.580]  Thank you so much for the plugs.
[02:18:42.580 --> 02:18:46.740]  But listen, when people get the Patriot points, a lot of times it makes things a loss leader
[02:18:46.740 --> 02:18:50.460]  because if you're already getting 10% off because you're on auto ship, then we're doing
[02:18:50.460 --> 02:18:51.460]  50% off.
[02:18:51.460 --> 02:18:54.540]  And then you do something like that where you have Patriot points, we lose money.
[02:18:54.540 --> 02:18:55.540]  But that's okay.
[02:18:55.540 --> 02:18:56.540]  Thanks for the support.
[02:18:56.540 --> 02:19:03.140]  It's never been easy to figure out the essentials of a new supplement routine.
[02:19:03.140 --> 02:19:07.420]  That's why we created the eight pack power stack, your go to option for the building

[02:19:22.500 --> 02:19:26.220]  the counter or 20 minute morning habits.

[02:19:54.060 --> 02:20:20.460]  supplement routine.
[02:20:20.460 --> 02:20:43.740]  We're getting stronger, they're getting weaker.
[02:20:43.740 --> 02:20:48.900]  But you can't let them demoralize you, their full nastiness, their full celebration of
[02:20:48.900 --> 02:20:54.580]  killing already born babies and having sex with your children and devil worship is meant
[02:20:54.580 --> 02:20:56.420]  to make you give up.
[02:20:56.420 --> 02:21:02.180]  I've told this story probably 30 times now and I haven't really told the entire story.
[02:21:02.180 --> 02:21:07.340]  I was invited to the Sundance Film Festival and I told my crew exactly what it was and
[02:21:07.340 --> 02:21:14.380]  I sent a representative and he said, oh my God, it's exactly what we were talking about.
[02:21:14.380 --> 02:21:18.660]  They're openly saying, these are at meetings at dinner, they're not even hiding this.
[02:21:18.660 --> 02:21:23.420]  Our job is to demoralize and to shock people and just make them get overwhelmed that they
[02:21:23.420 --> 02:21:28.460]  give up and to just be the worst we can.
[02:21:28.460 --> 02:21:34.900]  That's why it's all pedophilia, devil worship because they're getting us to basically capitulate.
[02:21:34.900 --> 02:21:38.820]  It's not working.
[02:21:38.820 --> 02:21:44.260]  And I had this one group of famous filmmakers here and they were telling me all this stuff
[02:21:44.260 --> 02:21:50.300]  and I said, you've been sent here by the power structure and they're going to tell
[02:21:50.300 --> 02:21:53.380]  you once you think I'm going to do this film deal with you that this is your list of things
[02:21:53.380 --> 02:21:54.380]  to do.
[02:21:54.380 --> 02:21:56.380]  They later came back and said, you're right, we were given a list of things to do exactly
[02:21:56.380 --> 02:22:01.300]  what you said and I said, yeah, so go ahead and leave now.
[02:22:01.300 --> 02:22:07.820]  I've already been down this road over and over and over and over and over again.
[02:22:07.820 --> 02:22:12.780]  The globalists run the same place because they've worked but what worked back then isn't
[02:22:12.780 --> 02:22:15.020]  going to work now in this new system.
[02:22:15.020 --> 02:22:19.900]  It's not the new age that the new agers tell you about.
[02:22:19.900 --> 02:22:22.340]  It's the real new age, folks.
[02:22:22.340 --> 02:22:26.620]  And the dogs that hunted in the past aren't going to be hunting in the future.
[02:22:26.620 --> 02:22:28.340]  Their system's over.
[02:22:28.340 --> 02:22:29.820]  They're just now figuring it out.
[02:22:29.820 --> 02:22:34.020]  This is all the bluster of a rearguard action.
[02:22:34.020 --> 02:22:35.620]  So I'm not trying to get in.
[02:22:35.620 --> 02:22:42.060]  I'll be honest, if I was invited to the White House, I probably would not have gone.
[02:22:42.060 --> 02:22:45.060]  But I've already had the White House reach out to see if I want to go and I'm like, really,
[02:22:45.060 --> 02:22:47.420]  what's the point?
[02:22:47.420 --> 02:22:49.980]  What's the whole PR point of that?
[02:22:49.980 --> 02:22:52.660]  I'm the outlier.
[02:22:52.660 --> 02:22:53.660]  I'm the dark horse.
[02:22:53.660 --> 02:22:54.660]  So are you.
[02:22:54.660 --> 02:22:56.460]  That's what America's always been.
[02:22:56.460 --> 02:23:00.860]  We built new worlds, new cities, new countries, new systems.
[02:23:00.860 --> 02:23:02.980]  We're not back at the imperial throne rooms.
[02:23:02.980 --> 02:23:05.820]  It's great to have Trump there to try to direct the defeat of the globalists from that but
[02:23:05.820 --> 02:23:08.980]  the real power is you.
[02:23:08.980 --> 02:23:14.780]  It wasn't Charlie Chaplin said I wouldn't be part of any club that would have me.
[02:23:14.780 --> 02:23:15.780]  All right.
[02:23:15.780 --> 02:23:18.860]  It's been hold the longest year.
[02:23:18.860 --> 02:23:22.580]  Let's talk to Eli in the great state of Kentucky.
[02:23:22.580 --> 02:23:24.220]  Eli, you're on the air.
[02:23:24.220 --> 02:23:29.060]  Thanks, Alex, awesome to be on air with you today.
[02:23:29.060 --> 02:23:31.940]  I'm a first time caller.
[02:23:31.940 --> 02:23:32.940]  It's crazy, man.
[02:23:32.940 --> 02:23:36.940]  I just want to let you know that out here in the rural state of Kentucky, this is Trump
[02:23:36.940 --> 02:23:37.940]  country.
[02:23:37.940 --> 02:23:40.580]  We appreciate everything that you do every day.
[02:23:40.580 --> 02:23:45.700]  50 years from now when the history books are rewritten, you will be right next to President
[02:23:45.700 --> 02:23:51.220]  Donald Trump as one of the main voices that saved this country from globalism.
[02:23:51.220 --> 02:23:55.860]  And I just want to point out that when Obama was in office, I mean, the globalists were
[02:23:55.860 --> 02:24:03.260]  so arrogant in the fact that, you know, they came out and said the fact that, you know,
[02:24:03.260 --> 02:24:07.140]  we've taken over and there's nothing you can do about it.
[02:24:07.140 --> 02:24:13.820]  And now that President Trump has taken the Oval Office, he has single-handedly destroyed
[02:24:13.820 --> 02:24:15.140]  globalism.
[02:24:15.140 --> 02:24:18.980]  One man has taken down an entire system.
[02:24:18.980 --> 02:24:21.620]  And they're losing everywhere else as well.
[02:24:21.620 --> 02:24:22.620]  It's true.
[02:24:22.620 --> 02:24:26.300]  If you look across the world, populism is in a resurgence.
[02:24:26.300 --> 02:24:27.300]  I mean...
[02:24:27.300 --> 02:24:28.700]  So what do you say to the last callers?
[02:24:28.700 --> 02:24:30.580]  I'm not mad at them and I get their frustration.
[02:24:30.580 --> 02:24:35.100]  I get obsessed with this too because I'm waiting around having to look at, you know, pedophiles
[02:24:35.100 --> 02:24:38.340]  and devil worshipers all day, but I've got to warn people, so I've got to look at them.
[02:24:38.340 --> 02:24:41.100]  They'll start for cops and FBI that they'll like, you know, go to the crime scenes.
[02:24:41.100 --> 02:24:42.100]  I just couldn't do it.
[02:24:42.100 --> 02:24:45.140]  But that board patrol head said, I've been in the trailers with the dead kids and the
[02:24:45.140 --> 02:24:46.980]  steak and the father holding their baby.
[02:24:46.980 --> 02:24:49.700]  Don't you tell me, AOC, I'm killing kids, you damn liar.
[02:24:49.700 --> 02:24:51.780]  Because he's saving people.
[02:24:51.780 --> 02:24:53.900]  So I understand what that's like.
[02:24:53.900 --> 02:24:54.900]  But I just...
[02:24:54.900 --> 02:24:57.540]  I know the frustration though, it should be so easy to beat this.
[02:24:57.540 --> 02:24:59.460]  Choosing goodness should be so much easier.
[02:24:59.460 --> 02:25:02.060]  But you hear the callers thinking, oh, Trump's pulling a fast one.
[02:25:02.060 --> 02:25:03.220]  No, folks.
[02:25:03.220 --> 02:25:04.220]  He makes mistakes.
[02:25:04.220 --> 02:25:05.220]  It's not perfect.
[02:25:05.220 --> 02:25:06.220]  This is real.
[02:25:06.220 --> 02:25:07.860]  There's not just evil in the world.
[02:25:07.860 --> 02:25:11.420]  Trump doesn't have a heart on for America and he wants to be president.
[02:25:11.420 --> 02:25:12.420]  Those are two cardinal sins.
[02:25:12.420 --> 02:25:13.420]  Does that make sense?
[02:25:13.420 --> 02:25:14.420]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:25:14.420 --> 02:25:18.900]  And I think it's something else that you point out is Trump is alone.
[02:25:18.900 --> 02:25:25.340]  I mean, he is surrounded by remnants from the globalist regime that are still around him
[02:25:25.340 --> 02:25:28.220]  trying to sabotage anything that he wants to do.
[02:25:28.220 --> 02:25:31.700]  Oh, I've got a crew that loves me and I'm a jerk a lot because I get frustrated and I
[02:25:31.700 --> 02:25:32.700]  apologize to them.
[02:25:32.700 --> 02:25:37.940]  You know, I'm not...I'm 45, man, and I could not put up with enemies all around me.
[02:25:37.940 --> 02:25:43.140]  They've had a few infiltrators and they drew me crazy and some of them were family, I found
[02:25:43.140 --> 02:25:44.140]  out later.
[02:25:44.140 --> 02:25:45.140]  I could...
[02:25:45.140 --> 02:25:48.500]  Could you imagine having traitors around you who are lying about what you say and lying
[02:25:48.500 --> 02:25:51.660]  about what you do but using classified info to make part of it real?
[02:25:51.660 --> 02:25:52.660]  Could you imagine?
[02:25:52.660 --> 02:25:53.660]  I mean, it's...
[02:25:53.660 --> 02:25:54.660]  I'm not trying to kiss Trump's ass.
[02:25:54.660 --> 02:25:55.660]  It's incredible.
[02:25:55.660 --> 02:26:01.580]  73 years old surrounded by all those hyenas and the lion is in there getting most of his
[02:26:01.580 --> 02:26:06.380]  agenda done and he's replacing the Federal Reserve with patriots, they are crapping their
[02:26:06.380 --> 02:26:07.380]  drawers.
[02:26:07.380 --> 02:26:12.260]  And I just want to thank you, brother, for being a true American patriot because if anybody
[02:26:12.260 --> 02:26:17.180]  else had came up against all the attacks from the media and the slurs and the lies and the
[02:26:17.180 --> 02:26:22.620]  attacks that you actually have against you, any other person would have probably gave
[02:26:22.620 --> 02:26:23.620]  up by now.
[02:26:23.620 --> 02:26:24.620]  Brother, you're looking at this wrong.
[02:26:24.620 --> 02:26:26.620]  You're looking at this wrong.
[02:26:26.620 --> 02:26:28.580]  Once you're in this deep, there's no giving up anyways.
[02:26:28.580 --> 02:26:29.580]  I'm fighting for my life.
[02:26:29.580 --> 02:26:33.300]  You're the reason, you're the audience that sees through it.
[02:26:33.300 --> 02:26:35.260]  I'm not kissing your butt.
[02:26:35.260 --> 02:26:36.580]  Without you, I'd be destroyed.
[02:26:36.580 --> 02:26:38.420]  I'm literally in your hands.
[02:26:38.420 --> 02:26:40.100]  You're the reason we're still fighting.
[02:26:40.100 --> 02:26:41.820]  I can't give up.
[02:26:41.820 --> 02:26:43.420]  I'm being fed into the woodchipper.
[02:26:43.420 --> 02:26:47.060]  You're literally pulling me out of it every day with your prayers, your support.
[02:26:47.060 --> 02:26:48.260]  Do you understand that though?
[02:26:48.260 --> 02:26:51.060]  Because, Eli, I don't want you to get this ass backwards.
[02:26:51.060 --> 02:26:55.140]  You understand they're pissed about the show because it's a focal point for people like
[02:26:55.140 --> 02:26:57.340]  you to come together and to know you're not alone.
[02:26:57.340 --> 02:26:58.820]  They want to demoralize you.
[02:26:58.820 --> 02:27:00.340]  You understand that, right?
[02:27:00.340 --> 02:27:01.340]  Absolutely.
[02:27:01.340 --> 02:27:02.340]  Absolutely.
[02:27:02.340 --> 02:27:05.620]  I mean, you can tell with, I mean, with the way Google suppresses you, the way you've
[02:27:05.620 --> 02:27:08.980]  been banned off Twitter, I'll be honest.
[02:27:08.980 --> 02:27:13.700]  I'd always known who you were and respected you, but I didn't really come on board with
[02:27:13.700 --> 02:27:16.620]  you, man, until they completely tried to silence you.
[02:27:16.620 --> 02:27:23.860]  That woke me up to realizing, hey, this man has a lot of points and a lot of truth.
[02:27:23.860 --> 02:27:29.220]  But you look back in history, the regime always tries to suppress the one that speaks the
[02:27:29.220 --> 02:27:30.220]  truth.
[02:27:30.220 --> 02:27:31.580]  Well, they're suppressing Trump.
[02:27:31.580 --> 02:27:33.340]  They're shadow banning him.
[02:27:33.340 --> 02:27:37.380]  All the same crap that I've been put through, they just thought, oh, he's flamboyant.
[02:27:37.380 --> 02:27:38.740]  He's this folk hero.
[02:27:38.740 --> 02:27:41.660]  He's got a lot of warts that's exaggerated and tear him up.
[02:27:41.660 --> 02:27:42.700]  They'll turn on him.
[02:27:42.700 --> 02:27:46.100]  And then Jones will turn on Trump if we can get Trump to turn on him.
[02:27:46.100 --> 02:27:50.020]  That's why the last time I talked to Trump, I said, sir, if you even need to turn on me,
[02:27:50.020 --> 02:27:51.020]  you can, but I don't care.
[02:27:51.020 --> 02:27:53.900]  I'm not, as long as you're doing the policies I'm behind you, and that's why the Globals
[02:27:53.900 --> 02:27:56.780]  are so pissed, you see, because they're followers.
[02:27:56.780 --> 02:28:00.420]  They would sell out in a minute because all they're looking for is a bigger swimming pool
[02:28:00.420 --> 02:28:01.820]  or a bigger helicopter.
[02:28:01.820 --> 02:28:04.540]  Like my helicopter isn't as nice as my neighbor's helicopters.
[02:28:04.540 --> 02:28:08.740]  I know some of these real billionaires who are globalists, you know, over the years I've
[02:28:08.740 --> 02:28:10.940]  had meetings with them and around them, off record stuff.
[02:28:10.940 --> 02:28:11.940]  It wasn't corrupt.
[02:28:11.940 --> 02:28:15.660]  I met with them and I agree not to talk about it as long as they're not committing crime.
[02:28:15.660 --> 02:28:20.020]  And they're literally obsessed with their silver T-set isn't the nicest or there's
[02:28:20.020 --> 02:28:23.820]  one better that Lord Rothschild has or their helicopter isn't the newest one, but don't
[02:28:23.820 --> 02:28:25.700]  worry, they're getting a new one.
[02:28:25.700 --> 02:28:30.020]  And oh, I'm sorry, the private jet, kind of there's a crack in the seat over here, but
[02:28:30.020 --> 02:28:34.740]  you know, just like you're on like some 40,000, 40 million dollar jet and they're worried
[02:28:34.740 --> 02:28:36.420]  because there's a crack in the leather seat.
[02:28:36.420 --> 02:28:38.540]  These people are crazy.
[02:28:38.540 --> 02:28:41.740]  I do not want anything to do with people like that.
[02:28:41.740 --> 02:28:45.220]  I'd love a private jet to go places, but I'm sure as hell not going to get mad because
[02:28:45.220 --> 02:28:47.780]  my neighbor's got a bigger one than me.
[02:28:47.780 --> 02:28:49.100]  These people are crazy.
[02:28:49.100 --> 02:28:50.100]  God bless you.
[02:28:50.100 --> 02:28:55.420]  Eli, more calls straight ahead in a bunch of clubs.
[02:28:55.420 --> 02:28:58.100]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners.
[02:28:58.100 --> 02:29:02.540]  If you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup system, but we're waiting for prices
[02:29:02.540 --> 02:29:06.620]  too crazy to pass up, this will be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[02:29:06.620 --> 02:29:07.620]  Bill Hyde here.
[02:29:07.620 --> 02:29:11.660]  I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on our PPX microgrid
[02:29:11.660 --> 02:29:15.900]  system that's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity off the grid.
[02:29:15.900 --> 02:29:19.980]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the east
[02:29:19.980 --> 02:29:21.480]  bank of the Mississippi.
[02:29:21.480 --> 02:29:25.300]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location
[02:29:25.300 --> 02:29:29.060]  and rather than move it back to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price
[02:29:29.060 --> 02:29:33.420]  that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwaters backstory.
[02:29:33.420 --> 02:29:34.780]  So here's what you should do right now.

[02:33:00.020 --> 02:33:24.980]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:33:24.980 --> 02:33:30.980]  We've been taking a lot of really amazing calls and I've got five or six more calls
[02:33:30.980 --> 02:33:35.060]  that have been holding at least an hour and then I'll attempt to get to the others after
[02:33:35.060 --> 02:33:39.100]  that but Mike Adams is coming up and I am in a commandeer about 25 minutes of the show.
[02:33:39.100 --> 02:33:42.980]  He's cool about, he understands signing on to the fourth hour that happens sometimes.
[02:33:42.980 --> 02:33:49.740]  Mike Adams from news.com because I don't think that caller was wrong earlier when he said
[02:33:49.740 --> 02:33:51.860]  we're distracted by Trump.
[02:33:51.860 --> 02:33:53.700]  It's not Trump that's distracting us.
[02:33:53.700 --> 02:33:59.180]  It's that the big central banks, the private banks are trying to crash the U.S. economy
[02:33:59.180 --> 02:34:03.180]  and they're admitting it right now and they're trying to take our world reserve currency
[02:34:03.180 --> 02:34:08.180]  away and change the Bretton Woods agreement.
[02:34:08.180 --> 02:34:13.940]  Now I don't talk about violence and things to act tough and when I do it, it's either
[02:34:13.940 --> 02:34:18.820]  when I'm in an occasional rage and I ever once in a while do lose control that that's
[02:34:18.820 --> 02:34:20.340]  not an act when I blow up on air.
[02:34:20.340 --> 02:34:26.500]  It's a weakness and I pray to God every day to control my temper because it's my weakness.
[02:34:26.500 --> 02:34:30.540]  But it's also all of our strength that we're real, right?
[02:34:30.540 --> 02:34:39.340]  But the fact that they're trying to crash the economy, George Washington would get death
[02:34:39.340 --> 02:34:45.620]  warrants and he'd have people march in and they'd kill the heads of all those companies.
[02:34:45.620 --> 02:34:48.420]  That's why George Washington was respected.
[02:34:48.420 --> 02:34:53.740]  He didn't commit war crimes but he got death warrants to kill people and he led from the
[02:34:53.740 --> 02:34:54.740]  front.
[02:34:54.740 --> 02:34:59.380]  So I'm just going to tell you something, when banks that are out of our country have signed
[02:34:59.380 --> 02:35:03.900]  up with China and they're trying to plunge the economy to take your pension funds, your
[02:35:03.900 --> 02:35:08.980]  social security, your savings, your whole life because they want to piss on our country
[02:35:08.980 --> 02:35:16.340]  because we were Christian, well, you're not walking on the fighting side of me, folks.
[02:35:16.340 --> 02:35:19.860]  You're not walking on the, they're walking on the survival side of us.
[02:35:19.860 --> 02:35:24.860]  So I don't want any violence against JP Morgan Chase any of them but I'll tell the president
[02:35:24.860 --> 02:35:29.340]  this.
[02:35:29.340 --> 02:35:35.580]  Before they start a physical civil war with their method and if a people, we have a Pentagon,
[02:35:35.580 --> 02:35:40.060]  we have the Marine Corps and we have the Delta Force and we have assassination teams to take
[02:35:40.060 --> 02:35:45.940]  out enemies extrajudicially and we're in an extrajudicial situation and to be much, I know
[02:35:45.940 --> 02:35:49.380]  it's a very dangerous road to go down but here's the problem.
[02:35:49.380 --> 02:35:52.100]  They've put us in this position.
[02:35:52.100 --> 02:35:53.220]  We didn't want to go this way.
[02:35:53.220 --> 02:35:54.940]  We've tried to fix things peacefully.
[02:35:54.940 --> 02:35:58.500]  We've tried to, and now they're saying we're murdering children at the border and making
[02:35:58.500 --> 02:35:59.500]  them drink out of toilets.
[02:35:59.500 --> 02:36:06.220]  I mean, they're inciting war and they've got a gun to our head and I'm not saying go
[02:36:06.220 --> 02:36:10.900]  give helicopter rides to the heads of Google and Facebook.
[02:36:10.900 --> 02:36:18.580]  I'm just saying that from a historical, mathematical threat continuum spectrum, we've reached those
[02:36:18.580 --> 02:36:24.500]  points where if the president thought he had the leadership to carry it out, I think
[02:36:24.500 --> 02:36:28.700]  President Trump would do it and I know President Trump's had talks about it.
[02:36:28.700 --> 02:36:32.940]  If they try to kill him or start blowing stuff up, try to take the power grid out and you
[02:36:32.940 --> 02:36:35.900]  know anti-fund, the Democrats are trained to take the power grid out, right?
[02:36:35.900 --> 02:36:39.300]  I think we've got the documents right here.
[02:36:39.300 --> 02:36:47.420]  So people always wonder why do socialists and communists bring down civilizations?
[02:36:47.420 --> 02:36:48.420]  It's what they do.
[02:36:48.420 --> 02:36:52.540]  They're satanic.
[02:36:52.540 --> 02:37:02.620]  So you've got callers calling in talking about, you know, when's the shooting start?
[02:37:02.620 --> 02:37:03.620]  Shooting start started.
[02:37:03.620 --> 02:37:05.740]  They're already firebombing ice facilities, they're already shooting cops in the back
[02:37:05.740 --> 02:37:06.740]  all over the country.
[02:37:06.740 --> 02:37:09.500]  What do you think is going on?
[02:37:09.500 --> 02:37:12.460]  And those things get played down even by Republicans because they're being advised.
[02:37:12.460 --> 02:37:16.700]  If you hype this, more is going to happen.
[02:37:16.700 --> 02:37:23.460]  So I'm not up here trying to general any type of physical uprising.
[02:37:23.460 --> 02:37:26.500]  In fact, it's the opposite.
[02:37:26.500 --> 02:37:29.860]  The problem is they're not going to let us win peacefully and I think we all know that
[02:37:29.860 --> 02:37:30.860]  now.
[02:37:30.860 --> 02:37:34.980]  I think that's really why we all have a sick feeling on our stomachs and so we're all
[02:37:34.980 --> 02:37:36.940]  having to ask ourselves, what the hell do we do here?
[02:37:36.940 --> 02:37:41.540]  Because let me tell you something, boats are left to run around burning stuff down.
[02:37:41.540 --> 02:37:45.500]  It's going to be an empty feeling when you're looking at somebody in their black pajamas
[02:37:45.500 --> 02:37:47.900]  with their brain spread out in a pool of blood.
[02:37:47.900 --> 02:37:48.900]  Big deal.
[02:37:48.900 --> 02:37:51.060]  You just stomped on a turd.
[02:37:51.060 --> 02:37:52.940]  Now I get it.
[02:37:52.940 --> 02:37:53.940]  It's like pulling teeth.
[02:37:53.940 --> 02:37:56.980]  It's got to, you know, if it goes to that point, that's going to happen.
[02:37:56.980 --> 02:38:00.700]  But I just want to make sure that we don't act like a bunch of bulls charging off at
[02:38:00.700 --> 02:38:11.580]  red capes here because of the feces hits the oscillating fan blade.
[02:38:11.580 --> 02:38:17.420]  It's every single corporate Democrat, globalist leader that's going to be jumping.
[02:38:17.420 --> 02:38:21.140]  If this stuff all kicks off, if you go to the private airports, you hear about the
[02:38:21.140 --> 02:38:22.780]  president's been killed.
[02:38:22.780 --> 02:38:25.700]  You hear about police partners being attacked everywhere by communists.
[02:38:25.700 --> 02:38:30.900]  If you go to the local private airfield, you're going to see black SUVs pulling up because
[02:38:30.900 --> 02:38:32.300]  they're going to go right when it starts.
[02:38:32.300 --> 02:38:36.140]  And they're going to be flying out to New Zealand and Kauai, Hawaii and places like
[02:38:36.140 --> 02:38:39.180]  that and Luxembourg.
[02:38:39.180 --> 02:38:41.860]  So you want real intel.
[02:38:41.860 --> 02:38:46.500]  You got to be up when it all happens and you got to go to the local airfield and they'll
[02:38:46.500 --> 02:38:52.340]  all be pulling up and leaving because they're going to sit it out while we all kill each
[02:38:52.340 --> 02:38:59.580]  other.
[02:38:59.580 --> 02:39:03.380]  So you want to talk master plan military stuff?
[02:39:03.380 --> 02:39:04.380]  I could talk about it all day.
[02:39:04.380 --> 02:39:06.300]  I actually got a brain for that.
[02:39:06.300 --> 02:39:08.060]  That's actually my specialty.
[02:39:08.060 --> 02:39:20.460]  But the point is, is that we don't want to go into that position.
[02:39:20.460 --> 02:39:27.700]  But yeah, we're in the middle of a foreign occupation of the media and the government.
[02:39:27.700 --> 02:39:32.220]  We have a president trying to remove the cancer because our own military and agencies are
[02:39:32.220 --> 02:39:33.580]  like, hey, we're corrupt.
[02:39:33.580 --> 02:39:34.580]  We're not perfect.
[02:39:34.580 --> 02:39:37.260]  But my God, we're not going to sell out the tricoms from a power position.
[02:39:37.260 --> 02:39:40.500]  Why would we just screw America over when we have all the cards?
[02:39:40.500 --> 02:39:41.780]  Because it's metaphysical.
[02:39:41.780 --> 02:39:45.100]  Because the globalists want us to go down for world government.
[02:39:45.100 --> 02:39:47.300]  They want every little wimpy scum.
[02:39:47.300 --> 02:39:52.020]  Let me tell you about the CIA or all these agencies, you'll have little egghead nerds
[02:39:52.020 --> 02:39:54.180]  who are totally threatened by the military people.
[02:39:54.180 --> 02:39:55.980]  And that's what they love, sending them off to die.
[02:39:55.980 --> 02:39:57.460]  They talk crap about them behind their backs.
[02:39:57.460 --> 02:40:01.220]  They talk about how they're useful idiots, how they're cannon fodder, how they're stupid.
[02:40:01.220 --> 02:40:08.980]  That's what Henry Kissinger said about the military because they're threatened by it.
[02:40:08.980 --> 02:40:10.900]  And that's what this whole exercise is.
[02:40:10.900 --> 02:40:12.900]  But I'll tell you the good news.
[02:40:12.900 --> 02:40:20.780]  I talked to a famous CIA commando just the other day, and then another friend of mine
[02:40:20.780 --> 02:40:24.580]  ran into one of these guys we know on the Hike and Back Trail, and we're like, we thought
[02:40:24.580 --> 02:40:29.820]  you were off, you know, guarding Mr. Teddlingwinks, and he said, no, I just can't handle it even
[02:40:29.820 --> 02:40:30.820]  though the money's so big.
[02:40:30.820 --> 02:40:32.060]  I just can't be around these people.
[02:40:32.060 --> 02:40:33.860]  And that was it.
[02:40:33.860 --> 02:40:35.820]  It's like they can't even, let me explain something.
[02:40:35.820 --> 02:40:38.820]  They can't get anybody to protect them now.
[02:40:38.820 --> 02:40:40.540]  People are like $300,000 a year.
[02:40:40.540 --> 02:40:45.540]  But no, I'm not, they can't be around it.
[02:40:45.540 --> 02:40:47.020]  And so what does that tell you?
[02:40:47.020 --> 02:40:52.340]  They're a day late, a dollar short on getting their little robots and all their little, it's
[02:40:52.340 --> 02:40:53.340]  all fantasy.
[02:40:53.340 --> 02:40:56.300]  None of it's going to happen.
[02:40:56.300 --> 02:41:02.180]  And of all these little meth head, big tech guys all hauling ass to New Zealand when they're
[02:41:02.180 --> 02:41:08.340]  not over here telling us to take our brain chips, if they think their life's worth $0.10
[02:41:08.340 --> 02:41:14.460]  when a civil war starts, the first thing that's going to happen is you're going to get wire
[02:41:14.460 --> 02:41:20.140]  wrapped around your neck, and you're going to black out, and you're going to be dead.
[02:41:20.140 --> 02:41:23.180]  And then everything in your facility is going to get jacked.
[02:41:23.180 --> 02:41:28.380]  You see, the people you're around don't want money.
[02:41:28.380 --> 02:41:31.620]  They want victory for our species, and they want you dead.
[02:41:31.620 --> 02:41:33.460]  And you are dead.
[02:41:33.460 --> 02:41:34.660]  You understand that?
[02:41:34.660 --> 02:41:36.340]  You're already the walking dead.
[02:41:36.340 --> 02:41:37.340]  You haven't figured it out yet.
[02:41:37.340 --> 02:41:42.100]  You'll figure it out soon enough that there are a lot of people on this planet that don't
[02:41:42.100 --> 02:41:45.740]  care about status or money, care about justice and our children.
[02:41:45.740 --> 02:41:48.780]  And if you want to run your mouth and threaten us and talk about how you're going to kill
[02:41:48.780 --> 02:41:51.580]  us, it's you who are going to die.
[02:41:51.580 --> 02:41:52.580]  You understand that?
[02:41:52.580 --> 02:41:53.820]  We do the killing.
[02:41:53.820 --> 02:41:55.980]  We do the hanging.
[02:41:55.980 --> 02:41:59.140]  And the age of man isn't over.
[02:41:59.140 --> 02:42:03.180]  The age of humanity has just begun.
[02:42:03.180 --> 02:42:07.700]  So you can set your watch by that, and you can bet your bottom dollar, all you little
[02:42:07.700 --> 02:42:13.220]  piss hands that want to destroy women and destroy children and destroy families, destroy
[02:42:13.220 --> 02:42:14.620]  our strength.
[02:42:14.620 --> 02:42:17.460]  You'll destroy nothing.
[02:42:17.460 --> 02:42:19.340]  You've only come to test us.
[02:42:19.340 --> 02:42:21.860]  You were a tool used by God.
[02:42:21.860 --> 02:42:27.020]  And when we're done with you, you'll be thrown in the ash heap of history, not us.
[02:42:27.020 --> 02:42:33.780]  You can guarantee everything that ever was, that ever has been, and ever will be.
[02:42:33.780 --> 02:42:39.180]  The God's real, the devil's real, the universe is real, this planet orbiting that big sun
[02:42:39.180 --> 02:42:45.660]  glowing outside is real, and the laws of nature are incontrovertible.
[02:42:45.660 --> 02:43:00.740]  You're losers, globalists, and that's why you chose Satan, and now you're going to
[02:43:00.740 --> 02:43:18.620]  have to go to hell, you're going to have to go to hell, you're going to have to go to
[02:43:18.620 --> 02:43:19.620]  hell.
[02:43:19.620 --> 02:43:48.820]  You're going to have to go to hell, you're going to have to go to hell.
[02:43:49.620 --> 02:44:00.020]  I talk about this on the air, and I know it sinks into people, but I've decided that
[02:44:00.020 --> 02:44:03.740]  we're going to kind of reboot all our supplements in that if you go back five, six years ago
[02:44:03.740 --> 02:44:06.940]  before all the censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits and the rest of it, I would
[02:44:06.940 --> 02:44:10.180]  talk about how great the products are and how they were the best and why they were,
[02:44:10.180 --> 02:44:12.860]  and I'd have doctors on and experts to explain why they were so good.
[02:44:12.860 --> 02:44:16.220]  And instead, the last few years, I'm like, hey, we need to really support us or they'll
[02:44:16.220 --> 02:44:17.220]  shut us down.
[02:44:17.220 --> 02:44:19.580]  The biggest thing people like to buy is supplements because they know how great they are and how
[02:44:19.580 --> 02:44:20.580]  wonderful they were.
[02:44:20.580 --> 02:44:22.420]  And the left always has headlines everywhere.
[02:44:22.420 --> 02:44:26.780]  Jones sells unapproved supplements, and he claims they're supplements.
[02:44:26.780 --> 02:44:32.020]  No, under federal law since 1996, you can't say that a supplement has been through the
[02:44:32.020 --> 02:44:34.700]  FDA because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it.
[02:44:34.700 --> 02:44:38.540]  But then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them, and all drugs are is the
[02:44:38.540 --> 02:44:42.100]  system trying to tweak what's in Mother Nature and manipulate it and do different things,
[02:44:42.100 --> 02:44:43.420]  and a lot of drugs work great.
[02:44:43.420 --> 02:44:47.380]  They have side effects, not with Mother Nature, but Big Pharma doesn't want you knowing about
[02:44:47.380 --> 02:44:49.060]  God's medicine chest.
[02:44:49.060 --> 02:45:00.700]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with one of our most powerful
[02:45:00.700 --> 02:45:03.260]  products ever made, Alpha Power.
[02:45:03.260 --> 02:45:06.780]  As you age, your body can lose testosterone over time.

[02:47:36.060 --> 02:47:49.740]  So many of my relatives look like one else, little hobbit preachers, nice sweet little
[02:47:49.740 --> 02:47:58.860]  texas, good people, you know Willie, supports the Democrats but he's 86.
[02:47:58.860 --> 02:48:04.100]  Last time I had dinner with him six years ago he wasn't really all there, so remember
[02:48:04.100 --> 02:48:06.700]  that kind of they got Charlton Heston to come out against the second amendment before he
[02:48:06.700 --> 02:48:15.580]  died with his wife on dateline, that wasn't Charlton Heston, and that guy you see out
[02:48:15.580 --> 02:48:24.300]  there is not Willie Nelson, so remember folks for who they were, except my mom's dad had
[02:48:24.300 --> 02:48:27.860]  dementia and stuff before he died, he had a couple heart attacks, he was like a big
[02:48:27.860 --> 02:48:34.860]  baby but that's not my grandfather, you know.
[02:48:34.860 --> 02:48:42.900]  Go to your phone calls here, the good news is we're going to get to all of the bad news
[02:48:42.900 --> 02:48:46.940]  is we're out of time, we've got a bunch of clubs to play and breaking news and big stuff
[02:48:46.940 --> 02:48:51.420]  on Google and more before Mike Adams comes on from naturalnews.com, I'm just going to
[02:48:51.420 --> 02:48:56.860]  leave this very briefly and very simply, t-shirts, the new Betsy Ross design because that was
[02:48:56.860 --> 02:49:00.100]  collector edition, it sold out super quick, people want it, we've got a new collector's
[02:49:00.100 --> 02:49:04.740]  edition and we've got the Chris Pratt inspired shirt, which is the American flag, the Don't
[02:49:04.740 --> 02:49:08.260]  Tread on Me with a Snake on it, which I had the same idea the week before, that was the
[02:49:08.260 --> 02:49:11.460]  new shirt that week and then I saw him and they were protesting it and I was just like
[02:49:11.460 --> 02:49:15.580]  wow, that's really kind of common sense, like combine Don't Tread on Me under the American
[02:49:15.580 --> 02:49:19.820]  flag with a snake, that's because saying Don't Tread on the flag, it's even more specific,
[02:49:19.820 --> 02:49:25.140]  so and that will sell out at current sales rates by next week and then that will be it
[02:49:25.140 --> 02:49:31.980]  for these designs, but that does help on the operation, we've got DNA force back in stock,
[02:49:31.980 --> 02:49:36.420]  it's 50% off right now, we've also got Surmovitale, 50% off, those are really great products,
[02:49:36.420 --> 02:49:39.940]  you should try them, just believe me, just try them, it funds the operation, you can't
[02:49:39.940 --> 02:49:42.980]  lose and I only want to bring in the best stuff because I want it to work so you buy
[02:49:42.980 --> 02:49:52.180]  more of it, people get great response on turmeric, when the average turmeric is 3-5%, we have
[02:49:52.180 --> 02:49:57.180]  the extract 95% curcuminoid, people are blown away by it and it costs us a lot more to do
[02:49:57.180 --> 02:50:01.260]  it, but why shouldn't I do that?
[02:50:01.260 --> 02:50:07.900]  That's what I take, it's what my family takes, that said, most everybody loves the protein
[02:50:07.900 --> 02:50:12.900]  bars that are back in stock, but we went to the biggest maker of organic protein bars
[02:50:12.900 --> 02:50:16.220]  over a year ago trying to develop this and they said, wait, you don't want any corn or
[02:50:16.220 --> 02:50:21.500]  you don't want any wheat in it, well, you need that because people don't want something
[02:50:21.500 --> 02:50:25.860]  that's like a big piece of toffee that's hard if there's no filler, and I said, I want
[02:50:25.860 --> 02:50:29.580]  no fillers, and they said, okay, it's half as much if you put the filler in and people
[02:50:29.580 --> 02:50:35.180]  like it because it breaks off and most people like it, but it takes like 20 minutes to eat
[02:50:35.180 --> 02:50:41.780]  one of these because there's no filler, it's solid, it's thick, but we are going to come
[02:50:41.780 --> 02:50:46.460]  out with what's called traditional and they'll end up costing less because if you want it,
[02:50:46.460 --> 02:50:49.780]  I'm going to give you what you want, I'm going to give it to you with filler, so we've got
[02:50:49.780 --> 02:50:57.020]  a whole another group coming out that'll say, you know, traditional because, you know, I'm
[02:50:57.020 --> 02:51:01.500]  the boss around here, so it's kind of weird like, I'm not going to listen to food experts,
[02:51:01.500 --> 02:51:07.060]  no filler, and they're like, well, you know, filler is not just about lower cost, it'll
[02:51:07.060 --> 02:51:11.660]  be as hard as a rock without, I don't care, but so people actually, more people like it
[02:51:11.660 --> 02:51:14.580]  than don't, but some don't, I mean, I'll be honest with you, they taste great, but I'm
[02:51:14.580 --> 02:51:18.340]  like, in the car eating when I'm like, it took me 20 minutes to eat this, I can eat
[02:51:18.340 --> 02:51:24.140]  five hamburgers in that time, so there's nothing like it out there, folks, there's
[02:51:24.140 --> 02:51:25.140]  no filler on it.
[02:51:25.140 --> 02:51:30.820]  All right, I'm going to stop ranting, inforstor.com, Optimus Prime called in, but he's the last
[02:51:30.820 --> 02:51:34.340]  caller I'll get to, Autobots roll out.
[02:51:34.340 --> 02:51:38.540]  Let's right now go to Julius in Colorado, thanks for holding, you're on the air.
[02:51:38.540 --> 02:51:45.740]  Hey, Alex, I love your show, you heroes, so I just want to say that during the hearings,
[02:51:45.740 --> 02:51:53.100]  you've reminded me of the John Kerry hearings where he just looks like, he looked like Frankenstein,
[02:51:53.100 --> 02:51:57.460]  John Kerry looked like Frankenstein, like he had a thousand shots of Botox.
[02:51:57.460 --> 02:52:01.540]  I don't know if they're having the gay sex rituals and coffins begging for spiritual
[02:52:01.540 --> 02:52:05.460]  possession or, you know, I mean, they look, oh, they're all on drugs.
[02:52:05.460 --> 02:52:10.300]  You look at Elon Musk, and when he was pushing the brain chip last week, and did you see
[02:52:10.300 --> 02:52:14.180]  him and his other, those were sweating, their eyes were this big, I mean, the cop pulled
[02:52:14.180 --> 02:52:18.540]  you over, he'd be arrested, it was like just, and remember, they're under lights, they're
[02:52:18.540 --> 02:52:19.540]  under lights.
[02:52:19.540 --> 02:52:20.540]  Yeah.
[02:52:20.540 --> 02:52:26.420]  I mean, they look haggard and just like, you know, I mean, every photo, yeah, we're
[02:52:26.420 --> 02:52:29.140]  kicking the living hell out of them, brother.
[02:52:29.140 --> 02:52:33.980]  Yeah, every photo of Mueller, he literally has this demonic grimace in his face, you
[02:52:33.980 --> 02:52:36.780]  know, and just, he literally looks so evil.
[02:52:36.780 --> 02:52:37.780]  I mean, demon.
[02:52:37.780 --> 02:52:39.460]  Well, let me tell you the word on him.
[02:52:39.460 --> 02:52:42.220]  You know, he ran Whitey Bolger.
[02:52:42.220 --> 02:52:48.460]  That was his first job was the Italian mom had gotten too powerful by the 70s and 80s.
[02:52:48.460 --> 02:52:53.220]  They were pushing a lot of people around and they use the Irish mafia to commit a bunch
[02:52:53.220 --> 02:52:54.220]  of murders.
[02:52:54.220 --> 02:52:55.220]  And that's what Mueller does.
[02:52:55.220 --> 02:52:56.220]  He would do the killings himself, reportedly.
[02:52:56.220 --> 02:53:01.180]  I mean, he, dude, he ran Epstein and the, and the videoing screwing little girls as
[02:53:01.180 --> 02:53:02.180]  young as 10.
[02:53:02.180 --> 02:53:04.100]  I remember I said that last year and they freaked out on me.
[02:53:04.100 --> 02:53:08.740]  Now that's come out that, that he was, I mean, that dude's bad just because he was a Marine.
[02:53:08.740 --> 02:53:11.780]  A lot of folks joined the military, I'd say 5% because they're psychotic and want to be
[02:53:11.780 --> 02:53:14.140]  killed people just because he got a silver star.
[02:53:14.140 --> 02:53:15.140]  Okay, great.
[02:53:15.140 --> 02:53:17.940]  The point is, is that he is a globalist through and through.
[02:53:17.940 --> 02:53:22.980]  And you know, all this talk about the civil war and everything, I think the best peaceful
[02:53:22.980 --> 02:53:29.220]  solution is we have to reject the globalist, unitary federal government, dissolve completely
[02:53:29.220 --> 02:53:36.020]  and embrace a totally confederate, a confederation system of total power to the states.
[02:53:36.020 --> 02:53:38.060]  You know, all the infrastructures are already there.
[02:53:38.060 --> 02:53:39.500]  We don't need the federal government.
[02:53:39.500 --> 02:53:43.220]  They're just waging wars and it's just a giant welfare system.
[02:53:43.220 --> 02:53:46.220]  And then every state can just enforce its own laws.
[02:53:46.220 --> 02:53:51.620]  And I agree, listen, I'm a federalist actually, you know, we think of federalism as bad.
[02:53:51.620 --> 02:53:53.660]  This current system is not federalism.
[02:53:53.660 --> 02:53:55.380]  Federalism binds the federal government.
[02:53:55.380 --> 02:54:00.260]  You have state senators, the state elects the legislature, the legislature appoints
[02:54:00.260 --> 02:54:01.660]  the U.S. Senator.
[02:54:01.660 --> 02:54:06.260]  So you call that a confederate model, but really real federalism is more confederate
[02:54:06.260 --> 02:54:09.980]  than even what Jefferson Davis came up with.
[02:54:09.980 --> 02:54:14.060]  Yeah, but I hear you because here's the deal.
[02:54:14.060 --> 02:54:17.140]  The federal government can be influenced by foreign powers.
[02:54:17.140 --> 02:54:22.100]  What do you do though when foreign powers manipulate coalitions of states?
[02:54:22.100 --> 02:54:26.300]  I mean, I just think that it's just, it's not going to be peaceful and all the cronies
[02:54:26.300 --> 02:54:27.900]  are up, you know, at the top.
[02:54:27.900 --> 02:54:32.180]  So, you know, if Trump's smart, he wouldn't send in the troops, you know, if a couple
[02:54:32.180 --> 02:54:34.660]  states succeeded, right?
[02:54:34.660 --> 02:54:35.660]  We could just.
[02:54:35.660 --> 02:54:36.660]  I hear you.
[02:54:36.660 --> 02:54:38.460]  We would definitely lose our bond rating then.
[02:54:38.460 --> 02:54:39.940]  I appreciate your call.
[02:54:39.940 --> 02:54:47.420]  Listen, we have powerful financial issues and powerful financial institutions that are trying
[02:54:47.420 --> 02:54:50.940]  to break the country up already.
[02:54:50.940 --> 02:55:01.220]  And I'm a federalist, you know, I had family and I'm not going to get into it, but highest
[02:55:01.220 --> 02:55:07.020]  levels of the Confederacy, okay, and I know all about it.
[02:55:07.020 --> 02:55:12.700]  Daughters of Republic of Texas, whole nine yards, it's, it's, there's statues all over
[02:55:12.700 --> 02:55:17.660]  the south of my ancestors, but they got manipulated into that war.
[02:55:17.660 --> 02:55:18.660]  And that's a whole other debate.
[02:55:18.660 --> 02:55:23.220]  It doesn't mean Abraham Lincoln was good or the North was perfect, but British intelligence
[02:55:23.220 --> 02:55:24.860]  manipulated the South to do that.
[02:55:24.860 --> 02:55:28.860]  They promised them ships, they promised them Western expansion, and then they double crossed
[02:55:28.860 --> 02:55:32.700]  them and didn't deliver and left us high and dry.
[02:55:32.700 --> 02:55:37.660]  And Sam Houston, the founded Texas was the governor at the time.
[02:55:37.660 --> 02:55:41.100]  He'd been the president of Texas, but he was governor and they, they kicked him out of
[02:55:41.100 --> 02:55:44.780]  Houston and they ran him out of the state of Texas and almost killed him.
[02:55:44.780 --> 02:55:47.860]  And he was an old smart general.
[02:55:47.860 --> 02:55:51.580]  He was what Davey Crockett wish he was a real badass.
[02:55:51.580 --> 02:55:56.260]  He's what Arnold Schwarzenegger would dream about in movies or like 300 type stuff.
[02:55:56.260 --> 02:56:03.300]  I mean, like Andrew Jackson was a badass, but he wasn't the badass that Sam Houston
[02:56:03.300 --> 02:56:04.300]  was.
[02:56:04.300 --> 02:56:05.300]  Okay.
[02:56:05.300 --> 02:56:08.100]  Like Sam Houston would kill like 20, 30 people by himself in hand to hand combat.
[02:56:08.100 --> 02:56:11.900]  I mean, we're talking a monster breaking people's necks, pulling arrows out of himself
[02:56:11.900 --> 02:56:12.900]  the whole nine yards.
[02:56:12.900 --> 02:56:13.900]  He was also super smart.
[02:56:13.900 --> 02:56:18.860]  Texas was founded by an awesome guy by Hollywood puts him down a gambler and alcoholic, all
[02:56:18.860 --> 02:56:19.860]  this B.S.
[02:56:19.860 --> 02:56:21.980]  And he said the civil war was wrong.
[02:56:21.980 --> 02:56:25.380]  They've got five times the men, they've got three times the weapons we're going to lose
[02:56:25.380 --> 02:56:29.540]  were being set up by British intelligence and British intelligence hyped Texas up and
[02:56:29.540 --> 02:56:32.500]  hyped everybody else up into that stupid war.
[02:56:32.500 --> 02:56:36.540]  And we basically never recovered from it.
[02:56:36.540 --> 02:56:39.420]  Slavery was already basically done in the South.
[02:56:39.420 --> 02:56:43.380]  It was a train wreck and British intelligence did that.
[02:56:43.380 --> 02:56:47.860]  And I'm digressing, but it just makes me very, very angry.
[02:56:47.860 --> 02:56:50.340]  And so I've never been anti government.
[02:56:50.340 --> 02:56:53.980]  I believe in a limited federal government and limited state governments.
[02:56:53.980 --> 02:57:01.420]  But you have to understand, folks, if we went back to the amendment in 1913, I'm so seen
[02:57:01.420 --> 02:57:06.420]  all now 17th amendment, 16th amendment, which one was, we got the IRS the same year, the
[02:57:06.420 --> 02:57:12.180]  Federal Reserve the same year, and we got it where US senators no longer were elected
[02:57:12.180 --> 02:57:13.180]  by the legislature.
[02:57:13.180 --> 02:57:15.460]  The senators were recalled to the state.
[02:57:15.460 --> 02:57:17.580]  They were officers of the state.
[02:57:17.580 --> 02:57:23.260]  So you want Confederate, the idea of the states having the power, the trick was the states
[02:57:23.260 --> 02:57:25.580]  did have the power before.
[02:57:25.580 --> 02:57:26.980]  And the federalist system did that.
[02:57:26.980 --> 02:57:29.900]  But we think because the federal government's called the federal government, that the federalist
[02:57:29.900 --> 02:57:30.900]  system's bad.
[02:57:30.900 --> 02:57:31.900]  No, the federalist system's good.
[02:57:31.900 --> 02:57:34.860]  And we, listen, how about we debate that later?
[02:57:34.860 --> 02:57:36.860]  How about we just get control of our country again?
[02:57:36.860 --> 02:57:37.860]  That's what we need to do.
[02:57:37.860 --> 02:57:39.860]  But hey, was the South bad ass?
[02:57:39.860 --> 02:57:42.860]  Did they, you know, one man kill 10 men on average?
[02:57:42.860 --> 02:57:43.860]  Damn right.
[02:57:43.860 --> 02:57:44.860]  That still got our ass set up.
[02:57:44.860 --> 02:57:46.660]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York.
[02:57:46.660 --> 02:57:47.660]  Marcus, you're on the air.
[02:57:47.660 --> 02:57:48.660]  Thanks for holding.
[02:57:48.660 --> 02:57:51.340]  Hey, I just want to say, your show is a breath of fresh air.
[02:57:51.340 --> 02:57:53.860]  I talked to a lot of people here out in New York City.
[02:57:53.860 --> 02:57:57.460]  And one thing I could tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars.
[02:57:57.460 --> 02:58:01.580]  I think that the neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they
[02:58:01.580 --> 02:58:05.660]  know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public.
[02:58:05.660 --> 02:58:06.660]  The approaching 2020.
[02:58:06.660 --> 02:58:07.660]  That's it.
[02:58:07.660 --> 02:58:10.220]  I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency.
[02:58:10.220 --> 02:58:13.020]  It's the only way I think he can be defeated other than assassinating him.
[02:58:13.020 --> 02:58:14.300]  It's a time to be praying, my friend.
[02:58:14.300 --> 02:58:15.300]  I agree entirely.
[02:58:15.300 --> 02:58:18.460]  And the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying to shut you down,
[02:58:18.460 --> 02:58:20.460]  but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[02:58:20.460 --> 02:58:23.340]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old.
[02:58:23.340 --> 02:58:25.660]  I'd love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[02:58:25.660 --> 02:58:28.860]  But if they do shut you down, no, you've gone into this war.
[02:58:28.860 --> 02:58:33.460]  You've won a lot of battles, and there are a lot of people like myself and many others
[02:58:33.460 --> 02:58:34.780]  who are going to continue.
[02:58:34.780 --> 02:58:36.700]  We're going to keep fighting in the Info War.
[02:58:36.700 --> 02:58:40.740]  And even if something does happen to you or your show, know for a fact that you've gotten
[02:58:40.740 --> 02:58:43.220]  a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[02:58:43.220 --> 02:58:47.420]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[02:58:47.420 --> 02:58:52.700]  Living with Info Wars is a great honor, but I still need my morning coffee.
[02:58:52.700 --> 02:58:58.940]  And luckily, our break room at the Info Wars headquarters is stocked full of high quality
[02:58:58.940 --> 02:59:02.900]  Info Wars store, Patriot Blend coffee.
[02:59:02.900 --> 02:59:09.740]  Grown in the high mountains of southern Mexico, the Chiapas farmers grow 100% organic, non-GMO
[02:59:09.740 --> 02:59:14.220]  coffee at the ideal altitude for the perfect cup.
[02:59:14.220 --> 02:59:19.500]  A robust coffee with great flavor and mild acidity.
[02:59:19.500 --> 02:59:22.900]  There has never been a more important time to support Info Wars.
[02:59:22.900 --> 02:59:30.500]  So if you love coffee, and if you want to fight for freedom, then you can help.
[02:59:30.500 --> 02:59:33.460]  Order now at the Info War store.
[02:59:33.460 --> 02:59:39.940]  Sign up for auto-ship and get your own high quality supply of Patriot Blend coffee delivered
[02:59:39.940 --> 02:59:49.380]  right to your door at infowarstore.com.
[02:59:49.380 --> 03:00:10.380]  Or listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:00:10.380 --> 03:00:11.380]  All right.
[03:00:11.380 --> 03:00:13.380]  I'm taking your calls right now.
[03:00:13.380 --> 03:00:16.380]  It's been all the longest here.
[03:00:16.380 --> 03:00:22.500]  I keep a close watch on this heart of mine.
[03:00:22.500 --> 03:00:25.180]  I keep my eyes wide open on...
[03:00:25.180 --> 03:00:27.660]  Joe in North Carolina, then David in Connecticut.
[03:00:27.660 --> 03:00:28.660]  Joe, thanks for calling.
[03:00:28.660 --> 03:00:29.660]  Thanks for holding.
[03:00:29.660 --> 03:00:30.660]  Hey, Alex.
[03:00:30.660 --> 03:00:33.980]  Thanks for everything you're doing.
[03:00:33.980 --> 03:00:39.260]  Just regarding Mueller, it was completely sad to see him up there.
[03:00:39.260 --> 03:00:45.260]  I was reminded of the insurance policy, and I was wondering if it was in fact actually
[03:00:45.260 --> 03:00:52.140]  a life insurance policy that they were referring to looking at how decrepit he looked up there
[03:00:52.140 --> 03:00:53.140]  when he was testifying.
[03:00:53.140 --> 03:00:59.340]  So I don't know, but it's sad to see the road to tyranny there, and it looks like it's
[03:00:59.340 --> 03:01:04.820]  just going to be spread with old, old people that don't know what the hell they're doing.
[03:01:04.820 --> 03:01:05.820]  Well, that's the thing.
[03:01:05.820 --> 03:01:10.180]  The wheels are completely falling off, and it was like weekend at Bernie's where they're
[03:01:10.180 --> 03:01:14.140]  carrying the dead body around, and it's just indicative that they can't believe they lost
[03:01:14.140 --> 03:01:15.580]  an election.
[03:01:15.580 --> 03:01:17.980]  And the big thing is what callers have said, Trump needs to take action.
[03:01:17.980 --> 03:01:22.620]  Well, the Justice Department is filled with lawyers that lie to his face and then don't
[03:01:22.620 --> 03:01:23.620]  do anything.
[03:01:23.620 --> 03:01:24.820]  I appreciate your call.
[03:01:24.820 --> 03:01:25.820]  We're moving fast now.
[03:01:25.820 --> 03:01:29.540]  Let's go ahead and take a call from David in Connecticut.
[03:01:29.540 --> 03:01:30.540]  You're on the air.
[03:01:30.540 --> 03:01:33.420]  Hey, what's going on, Alex?
[03:01:33.420 --> 03:01:37.380]  Brother, good to talk to you live on this auspicious Wednesday.
[03:01:37.380 --> 03:01:38.380]  Auspicious.
[03:01:38.380 --> 03:01:39.380]  Good word.
[03:01:39.380 --> 03:01:45.420]  It's great to talk to you.
[03:01:45.420 --> 03:01:52.660]  This whole investigation thing that went on today, it's like a, it's like a, like a snipe
[03:01:52.660 --> 03:01:53.820]  hunt.
[03:01:53.820 --> 03:01:56.700]  Say that again.
[03:01:56.700 --> 03:01:59.580]  It's like a snipe hunt.
[03:01:59.580 --> 03:02:01.180]  It is like a snipe.
[03:02:01.180 --> 03:02:06.020]  No, snipe, snipe, you know, the fake bird in the woods.
[03:02:06.020 --> 03:02:09.460]  Yeah, a snipe plot where you tell somebody they're going to go out and catch this bird
[03:02:09.460 --> 03:02:12.020]  with a bag, but really they're being left in the woods.
[03:02:12.020 --> 03:02:13.020]  Yeah.
[03:02:13.020 --> 03:02:22.100]  I mean, I, I, I actually think that this guy is being set up and he doesn't realize that
[03:02:22.100 --> 03:02:24.860]  he's going to get, it's going to get shut down.
[03:02:24.860 --> 03:02:29.900]  Well, I mean, listen, Mueller set up the group of Democrats that ran all this and they were
[03:02:29.900 --> 03:02:34.060]  sure they were going to get rid of Trump, but it didn't go the way they wanted it to.
[03:02:34.060 --> 03:02:36.260]  Exactly.
[03:02:36.260 --> 03:02:37.260]  I appreciate your call.
[03:02:37.260 --> 03:02:38.260]  Good points, David.
[03:02:38.260 --> 03:02:39.260]  Thank you for holding.
[03:02:39.260 --> 03:02:40.260]  Okay.
[03:02:40.260 --> 03:02:41.260]  Let's talk to another caller here.
[03:02:41.260 --> 03:02:42.260]  Carlos in Texas.
[03:02:42.260 --> 03:02:43.260]  Been holding Carlos.
[03:02:43.260 --> 03:02:44.260]  Welcome, sir.
[03:02:44.260 --> 03:02:45.260]  Hello, Mr. Jones.
[03:02:45.260 --> 03:02:46.260]  How are you doing?
[03:02:46.260 --> 03:02:47.260]  I'm good, sir.
[03:02:47.260 --> 03:02:48.260]  Welcome.
[03:02:48.260 --> 03:02:49.260]  Thank you for joining us.
[03:02:49.260 --> 03:02:53.540]  Well, I just get to tell you that I agree with one of the previous callers that you
[03:02:53.540 --> 03:02:56.340]  are going to be in the history books in the future.
[03:02:56.340 --> 03:02:58.140]  You have done a lot of, a lot for this country.
[03:02:58.140 --> 03:03:01.140]  You have done a lot, a lot for us.
[03:03:01.140 --> 03:03:09.180]  You woke me up back in 2012 when the whole Connie 212 agenda came out and I've been listening
[03:03:09.180 --> 03:03:11.580]  to you ever since.
[03:03:11.580 --> 03:03:13.860]  I also want to block some of your products.
[03:03:13.860 --> 03:03:21.020]  The survival chill, supermaid vitality, alpha power, bodies, DNA force, super blue, all
[03:03:21.020 --> 03:03:22.020]  of them are great.
[03:03:22.020 --> 03:03:25.620]  Which one gave you the best effects and tell us what happened?
[03:03:25.620 --> 03:03:31.620]  I would say the DNA force is between the DNA force and the supermaid vitality.
[03:03:31.620 --> 03:03:34.420]  Yeah, they both work really well.
[03:03:34.420 --> 03:03:35.420]  People love them.
[03:03:35.420 --> 03:03:36.740]  What do you think comes next?
[03:03:36.740 --> 03:03:37.940]  Because I think this was a train wreck.
[03:03:37.940 --> 03:03:40.620]  I think it showed how ridiculous they are, but they're not going to give up.
[03:03:40.620 --> 03:03:41.620]  What do you think is coming next?
[03:03:41.620 --> 03:03:46.220]  Well, you know, this was just a confirmation that they got nothing left.
[03:03:46.220 --> 03:03:47.220]  They're done.
[03:03:47.220 --> 03:03:48.220]  They're toasted.
[03:03:48.220 --> 03:03:51.540]  And I saw, you know, pretty sad for Mr. Miller.
[03:03:51.540 --> 03:03:53.620]  He is something that's going on with him.
[03:03:53.620 --> 03:03:54.620]  I am a nurse.
[03:03:54.620 --> 03:03:59.500]  So, definitely, he has a neurological deficit going on.
[03:03:59.500 --> 03:04:03.300]  You know, maybe Alzheimer's, dementia, whatever.
[03:04:03.300 --> 03:04:08.340]  But I was telling you, they got nothing left, and this was just a big distraction.
[03:04:08.340 --> 03:04:14.260]  Big distraction from all their crimes, from, you know, all the pedophilia that is going
[03:04:14.260 --> 03:04:17.380]  on, all of Hillary's crimes, Obama's crimes.
[03:04:17.380 --> 03:04:18.660]  Well, that's right.
[03:04:18.660 --> 03:04:22.620]  Every major institution is just getting taken over by pedophiles because they get them
[03:04:22.620 --> 03:04:25.620]  in, they compromise, and they bring their own people in, and it's how they control
[03:04:25.620 --> 03:04:26.620]  them.
[03:04:26.620 --> 03:04:27.620]  It's sick.
[03:04:27.620 --> 03:04:28.620]  Thank you so much, Carlos, for out of time.
[03:04:28.620 --> 03:04:30.740]  All right, listen, I took, like, 20 calls.
[03:04:30.740 --> 03:04:35.620]  We got more coming in, but I've got Mike Adams coming up, and I've got to get to all these
[03:04:35.620 --> 03:04:42.060]  reports, at least part of them, the huge Google bombshells, the pig with lipstick on
[03:04:42.060 --> 03:04:43.860]  we had on yesterday.
[03:04:43.860 --> 03:04:46.700]  Some listeners were mad, even producers were mad, that I wasn't meaner to him.
[03:04:46.700 --> 03:04:47.700]  I agree, I should have been.
[03:04:47.700 --> 03:04:50.380]  While I called back in on Owens, I was.
[03:04:50.380 --> 03:04:51.380]  That's coming up.
[03:04:51.380 --> 03:04:52.380]  Stay with us.
[03:04:52.380 --> 03:04:53.380]  I'm going to call him.
[03:04:53.380 --> 03:04:58.820]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena and the public square.
[03:04:58.820 --> 03:05:03.180]  The other thing that's unique about Info Wars is it isn't the only network of this reach
[03:05:03.180 --> 03:05:07.060]  that is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy, that's not backed
[03:05:07.060 --> 03:05:10.660]  by some billionaire, that's not being funded by a secret foreign government.
[03:05:10.660 --> 03:05:12.380]  It is completely independent of all that.
[03:05:12.380 --> 03:05:18.100]  It is an old school American 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of press
[03:05:18.100 --> 03:05:21.980]  and freedom of speech that, in fact, the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of
[03:05:21.980 --> 03:05:26.300]  the country, they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations just like this
[03:05:26.300 --> 03:05:29.860]  because this was the kind of press they wanted and that ultimately we now live in an era
[03:05:29.860 --> 03:05:33.700]  where they've mostly been co-opted by big corporations or billionaire sugar daddies
[03:05:33.700 --> 03:05:37.820]  who've been able to control and manipulate what news it views the persons allowed to
[03:05:37.820 --> 03:05:42.420]  have or express or hear and the Info Wars audience has broken through that.
[03:05:42.420 --> 03:05:46.780]  They are the bridge from the founding to the modern age ultimate American democracy and
[03:05:46.780 --> 03:05:47.780]  freedom.
[03:05:47.780 --> 03:05:52.260]  There has been an unprecedented onslaught of the platforming, defamation, lawfare and
[03:05:52.260 --> 03:06:02.460]  libel targeting youth.
[03:06:02.460 --> 03:06:10.580]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:10.580 --> 03:06:18.300]  So the corporate media is making hatred of a border existing a cultural icon.
[03:06:18.300 --> 03:06:20.260]  They're selling ice pinatas all over the country.
[03:06:20.260 --> 03:06:24.500]  We'll play video next segment of children beating up ice pinatas, antifascists, kill
[03:06:24.500 --> 03:06:28.540]  ice, they're firebombing their facilities, when we let 90% of the people go, we just
[03:06:28.540 --> 03:06:33.180]  send people that are convicted murderers, criminals, rapists back.
[03:06:33.180 --> 03:06:34.700]  It's just insane.
[03:06:34.700 --> 03:06:41.020]  I want to get to these reports because we have this goblin creature on the broadcast
[03:06:41.020 --> 03:06:42.020]  yesterday.
[03:06:42.020 --> 03:06:50.260]  I mean, they say you can't put lipstick on a pig, but they've successfully done it.
[03:06:50.260 --> 03:06:55.060]  And so this went viral yesterday when I had this creature.
[03:06:55.060 --> 03:06:56.700]  I forget his name.
[03:06:56.700 --> 03:07:01.260]  He goes by Jessica something.
[03:07:01.260 --> 03:07:06.540]  And this guy has open topless parties with 12 year old girls and says no parents allowed.
[03:07:06.540 --> 03:07:07.540]  Wow.
[03:07:07.540 --> 03:07:11.500]  But you never send your daughter to be topless with some fat dude with pink lipstick or with
[03:07:11.500 --> 03:07:16.140]  some guys you might marry in 20 years, you know, it's pedophilia, but it's all out there
[03:07:16.140 --> 03:07:17.820]  to show how tolerant you are.
[03:07:17.820 --> 03:07:20.740]  So I was trying to get him to say more what he was up to and he was on with me, but once
[03:07:20.740 --> 03:07:23.260]  he was on with Owen, I knew he was coming back up.
[03:07:23.260 --> 03:07:29.260]  I shot a video that we aired and played for literally the pig with lipstick.
[03:07:29.260 --> 03:07:35.780]  You talk about transgender, this is trans species, the big fat pig with pink lipstick.
[03:07:35.780 --> 03:07:38.180]  And again, the religion is don't say it's a man.
[03:07:38.180 --> 03:07:41.820]  No, you're a biological man that wants a bunch of little girls to come be with you with their
[03:07:41.820 --> 03:07:44.860]  tops off and you he defended it when he was on with me.
[03:07:44.860 --> 03:07:47.860]  So here's the clip.
[03:07:47.860 --> 03:07:55.860]  I don't want to sit here and buy into the cult mindset that a biological man can become
[03:07:55.860 --> 03:07:57.980]  a woman when you don't have a uterus.
[03:07:57.980 --> 03:08:03.620]  You don't have the same blood type, you don't have the same genetics, but all over the place,
[03:08:03.620 --> 03:08:11.380]  this entire movement of drag queen story time and the acceptance of transgenders has got
[03:08:11.380 --> 03:08:15.780]  Nambla written all over and it's all about targeting children, it's all about recruiting
[03:08:15.780 --> 03:08:16.780]  them.
[03:08:16.780 --> 03:08:18.100]  So you ask the question, it's why I called in Owen.
[03:08:18.100 --> 03:08:19.100]  Why is this everywhere?
[03:08:19.100 --> 03:08:20.740]  It's because it's Caitlyn Jenner.
[03:08:20.740 --> 03:08:21.740]  It's the news.
[03:08:21.740 --> 03:08:27.180]  I made a film, the in game 2.0, like 11 years ago.
[03:08:27.180 --> 03:08:31.740]  In it, we had professors and government documents on where they admitted that it was a plan
[03:08:31.740 --> 03:08:36.500]  to get people to not have children and a plan to basically sabotage the family.
[03:08:36.500 --> 03:08:41.020]  So it doesn't mean that individuals you've got on, they're very proud of what they're
[03:08:41.020 --> 03:08:44.340]  doing and believe they're a celebrity because they're involved with this themselves as
[03:08:44.340 --> 03:08:50.980]  a bad person, but the entire agenda is about eugenics, it's about depopulation, it's about
[03:08:50.980 --> 03:08:55.780]  targeting children when they're young and confusing their gender and then removing parental
[03:08:55.780 --> 03:09:00.940]  control and saying, well, an eight-year-old in Canada or the UK wants hormone replaced,
[03:09:00.940 --> 03:09:04.500]  but because there's all sorts of health problems, let's not lie about it, the highest rates
[03:09:04.500 --> 03:09:10.660]  of suicide, the highest rates of mental illness are in transgenders because they're the target
[03:09:10.660 --> 03:09:16.580]  of the transhuman eugenics movement of Aldous Huxley's brother, Julian Huxley.
[03:09:16.580 --> 03:09:21.940]  And so that's the bottom line, that's what's really going on here and they use people that
[03:09:21.940 --> 03:09:27.940]  have fallen into this because of their autism, their mental illness, whatever to be the fronts
[03:09:27.940 --> 03:09:31.260]  of this and they know that we have humanity, they know that we care, they know that we're
[03:09:31.260 --> 03:09:36.500]  actually classical liberals and so we accept people and that's the Trojan horse, we accept
[03:09:36.500 --> 03:09:41.580]  the entire movement to literally sabotage the human species as it exists and that's
[03:09:41.580 --> 03:09:42.580]  the truth.
[03:09:42.580 --> 03:09:52.500]  Jessica, your response in regards to transhumanism or in regards to the government paying for
[03:09:52.500 --> 03:09:53.500]  things like this?
[03:09:53.500 --> 03:09:55.420]  There's a total targeting of children with this.
[03:09:55.420 --> 03:09:57.900]  That's why it's popular, that's why it's everywhere.
[03:09:57.900 --> 03:10:01.060]  They're making it an option or making it an issue.
[03:10:01.060 --> 03:10:07.340]  Incredibly abusive, it's incredibly dark and everyone sees it.
[03:10:07.340 --> 03:10:17.300]  The one thing I want to state is it's not possible for anyone, even youth, to go to
[03:10:17.300 --> 03:10:22.900]  the doctor, to go to one doctor and start hormone, it's not possible.
[03:10:22.900 --> 03:10:23.900]  Even for myself.
[03:10:23.900 --> 03:10:28.780]  The question, children are being targeted and confused and parents are being told to
[03:10:28.780 --> 03:10:33.260]  step aside because the state wants to make sure we don't have children.
[03:10:33.260 --> 03:10:34.780]  I don't agree with that at all.
[03:10:34.780 --> 03:10:40.460]  Well, this is an AI globalist takeover and I predicted it before it was even launched.
[03:10:40.460 --> 03:10:42.100]  I don't agree with that at all.
[03:10:42.100 --> 03:10:44.940]  Jessica, would you be willing to compromise?
[03:10:44.940 --> 03:10:48.380]  Let's say you were a leader of this and they said, well, we're going to wait until you're
[03:10:48.380 --> 03:10:53.340]  18 years old or 21 years old before you can decide to do hormone therapy.
[03:10:53.340 --> 03:10:55.900]  I would totally take that to court.
[03:10:55.900 --> 03:10:56.900]  100%.
[03:10:56.900 --> 03:10:58.900]  But I don't understand this.
[03:10:58.900 --> 03:11:02.380]  Why is it so do you think kids should smoke cigarettes at age 12 and drink beer at age
[03:11:02.380 --> 03:11:03.380]  12?
[03:11:03.380 --> 03:11:08.660]  Well, but if they want to, if they want to transition to a different gender, it is.
[03:11:08.660 --> 03:11:13.060]  That's why we have parental consent because people are not of the age to judge because
[03:11:13.060 --> 03:11:16.340]  predators pull up in white bands and trick them.
[03:11:16.340 --> 03:11:20.140]  This is predators in government wanting access to our children, period.
[03:11:20.140 --> 03:11:24.260]  And you say, oh, I just want to take photos with girls in bathrooms and all this.
[03:11:24.260 --> 03:11:28.180]  But I think you're here as part of an apology tour because you know folks are awake and
[03:11:28.180 --> 03:11:30.660]  you are very confident in what you're doing.
[03:11:30.660 --> 03:11:35.060]  And so I'm here to tell you that targeting children with anything, be it drugs or sex
[03:11:35.060 --> 03:11:40.060]  or anything, is stealing their innocence and is vampiric and is satanic in the name of
[03:11:40.060 --> 03:11:41.060]  Jesus Christ.
[03:11:41.060 --> 03:11:45.340]  I repute that demonic spirit and ask them to wake up and say, no, back to you guys.
[03:11:45.340 --> 03:11:48.340]  You can have the final word, infowars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[03:11:48.340 --> 03:11:52.180]  Well, I mean, again, I want to point this out.
[03:11:52.180 --> 03:11:57.780]  In the Middle East, they would kill anybody that's gay, we're not against gay people.
[03:11:57.780 --> 03:12:02.060]  In the Middle East, anybody that was a man said they were a woman, they kill you.
[03:12:02.060 --> 03:12:04.460]  But the left all wants them to be here running things.
[03:12:04.460 --> 03:12:07.780]  But I ask who's more insane, the radical Islamists or those that put up with this?
[03:12:07.780 --> 03:12:12.980]  I don't hate this individual, even though they're trying to promote topless swimming
[03:12:12.980 --> 03:12:16.420]  clubs with 12-year-olds, obviously, we all know where that goes.
[03:12:16.420 --> 03:12:23.500]  It shows the mind control, this individual is cannon fodder and a larger operation.
[03:12:23.500 --> 03:12:27.740]  But targeting children and their innocence is the ultimate crime.
[03:12:27.740 --> 03:12:33.460]  And that's what the left, and all this is doing, and they defend it publicly.
[03:12:33.460 --> 03:12:39.620]  And then to say that this person who was a man, who wants to be a woman, good, I respect
[03:12:39.620 --> 03:12:42.340]  the fact that you want to be something else, but no, you're not.
[03:12:42.340 --> 03:12:44.900]  You're biologically, you're DNA, you're RNA.
[03:12:44.900 --> 03:12:47.940]  You don't have female mitochondrial DNA that only women have.
[03:12:47.940 --> 03:12:49.020]  You're not a woman.
[03:12:49.020 --> 03:12:55.740]  You can't have a child to say that some woman became a trans man and she can have a baby.
[03:12:55.740 --> 03:13:00.740]  Well, yeah, because she is a woman who said she was a man.
[03:13:00.740 --> 03:13:06.780]  And this shows how we have to give in the total and complete mental illness of the left
[03:13:06.780 --> 03:13:09.960]  and reject capitalism, reject the family.
[03:13:09.960 --> 03:13:12.780]  People can't stay on forms, mother or father.
[03:13:12.780 --> 03:13:15.460]  People can't stay any of this because we're under assault.
[03:13:15.460 --> 03:13:19.500]  This is a corporate global plan to depopulate us.
[03:13:19.500 --> 03:13:25.060]  This is a new world order plan to do this, and we're seeing it in plain view.
[03:13:25.060 --> 03:13:31.060]  And we're actually having someone come on here that's willing to admit all of this.
[03:13:31.060 --> 03:13:32.540]  Children are off limits.
[03:13:32.540 --> 03:13:36.580]  Everyone should keep their hands off the children and let them be innocent, but only predators
[03:13:36.580 --> 03:13:38.260]  target children.
[03:13:38.260 --> 03:13:42.900]  Only predators because they know children haven't developed yet, can't defend themselves.
[03:13:42.900 --> 03:13:47.580]  Just like child molesters and white vans or any of this, anyone that says they want to
[03:13:47.580 --> 03:13:52.780]  tell children what they are, want to tell their parents to go away, is an enemy of humanity
[03:13:52.780 --> 03:13:54.460]  and is damned to hell forever.
[03:13:54.460 --> 03:13:57.780]  And that's what import war stands against.
[03:13:57.780 --> 03:14:01.900]  And as I said at the start of the show today and the second hour and the third hour, we're
[03:14:01.900 --> 03:14:02.900]  going to air.
[03:14:02.900 --> 03:14:03.900]  Mike Adams is taking off today.
[03:14:03.900 --> 03:14:04.900]  He's fine.
[03:14:04.900 --> 03:14:08.820]  I'm going to stay here now because we're going to air coming up the bottom of the hour when
[03:14:08.820 --> 03:14:12.660]  I shot a video that aired on the show and then Owen asked him really great questions.
[03:14:12.660 --> 03:14:14.580]  It was powerful and that's what I want to air.
[03:14:14.580 --> 03:14:18.060]  So one way or another, that's going to go out here today.
[03:14:18.060 --> 03:14:20.420]  You just, you can set your watch by that's going to happen.
[03:14:20.420 --> 03:14:22.420]  I'm going to stick around until that happens.
[03:14:22.420 --> 03:14:25.540]  Got a lot of the stuff we haven't hit yet, obviously.
[03:14:25.540 --> 03:14:27.820]  We got a bunch of phone calls here.
[03:14:27.820 --> 03:14:35.100]  We got a lot to cover, but you know, it's truly disgusting the arrogance of these people.
[03:14:35.100 --> 03:14:41.900]  It's like when that one guy that works at a gay topless bar said, we're going to groom
[03:14:41.900 --> 03:14:46.100]  your kids, whether you like it or not, we're going to do this, that this is all about domination.
[03:14:46.100 --> 03:14:49.180]  It's all about control and it makes me incredibly angry.
[03:14:49.180 --> 03:14:51.580]  So that's what we're dealing with.
[03:14:51.580 --> 03:14:57.060]  But when we come back, I'm going to get into what's really important and I should have
[03:14:57.060 --> 03:14:58.140]  probably led the whole show with this.
[03:14:58.140 --> 03:15:03.900]  I think we had a theme today from the callers that this testimony is a diversion, but it
[03:15:03.900 --> 03:15:11.020]  exposes the whole lie and exposes the whole fraud and it shows how pathetic they are.
[03:15:11.020 --> 03:15:18.340]  So it's important, but really big central banks trying to plunge the dollar.
[03:15:18.340 --> 03:15:24.260]  And Google executives coming out saying, yes, we're involved in election stealing.
[03:15:24.260 --> 03:15:26.100]  That's really the biggest news, isn't it?
[03:15:26.100 --> 03:15:29.020]  And we're going to cover it when we come back.
[03:15:29.020 --> 03:15:35.100]  Current senior Google engineer, those public on camera, tech is dangerous, taking sides.
[03:15:35.100 --> 03:15:38.460]  It's all coming up on the other side and I ask you, please, whether you're listening
[03:15:38.460 --> 03:15:42.580]  a little bit, I am at the stations or the internet or shortwave or Howard, tell people
[03:15:42.580 --> 03:15:46.180]  about the broadcast because this is the light in the dark of the night.
[03:15:46.180 --> 03:15:48.740]  They don't want this transmission on air.
[03:15:48.740 --> 03:15:50.740]  Stay with us.
[03:15:50.740 --> 03:15:54.660]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:15:54.660 --> 03:15:58.580]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:15:58.580 --> 03:16:00.140]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:16:00.140 --> 03:16:03.100]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:16:03.100 --> 03:16:06.380]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with
[03:16:06.380 --> 03:16:08.620]  tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:16:08.620 --> 03:16:09.940]  I can help you too.
[03:16:09.940 --> 03:16:12.940]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[03:16:12.940 --> 03:16:15.180]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[03:16:15.180 --> 03:16:23.540]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com, that's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.

[03:17:51.860 --> 03:17:57.020]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York, Marcus here on the air, thanks for holding.
[03:17:57.020 --> 03:17:58.020]  Hey, Alex.
[03:17:58.020 --> 03:18:00.300]  Yeah, I just want to say, your show's a breath of fresh air.
[03:18:00.300 --> 03:18:03.940]  I talk to a lot of people here out in New York City, and one thing I can tell you is
[03:18:03.940 --> 03:18:06.420]  that almost nobody agrees with these wars.
[03:18:06.420 --> 03:18:10.820]  I think that the Neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know
[03:18:10.820 --> 03:18:15.140]  that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public, the approaching
[03:18:15.140 --> 03:18:16.140]  2020.
[03:18:16.140 --> 03:18:17.140]  That's it.
[03:18:17.140 --> 03:18:19.180]  I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency.
[03:18:19.180 --> 03:18:21.980]  It's the only way I think he could be defeated other than assassinating him.
[03:18:21.980 --> 03:18:23.300]  It's a time to be praying, my friend.
[03:18:23.300 --> 03:18:24.300]  I agree entirely.
[03:18:24.300 --> 03:18:27.780]  The last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying to shut you down, but
[03:18:27.780 --> 03:18:29.460]  the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[03:18:29.460 --> 03:18:32.300]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old.
[03:18:32.300 --> 03:18:34.660]  I'd love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[03:18:34.660 --> 03:18:37.860]  But if they do shut you down, no, you've gone into this war.
[03:18:37.860 --> 03:18:42.460]  You've won a lot of battles, and there are a lot of people like myself and many others
[03:18:42.460 --> 03:18:43.460]  who are going to continue.
[03:18:43.460 --> 03:18:47.020]  We're going to keep fighting in the input war, and even if something does happen to
[03:18:47.020 --> 03:18:52.220]  you or your show, know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[03:18:52.220 --> 03:18:54.340]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[03:18:54.340 --> 03:18:58.500]  The globalists are hyper-competitive scientific dictators.
[03:18:58.500 --> 03:18:59.580]  They are technocrats.
[03:18:59.580 --> 03:19:03.380]  They are control freaks in their own words, and they believe allowing you to live your
[03:19:03.380 --> 03:19:07.900]  own life and make your own decisions hits are the way of their great destiny to merge
[03:19:07.900 --> 03:19:08.900]  with AI gods.
[03:19:08.900 --> 03:19:11.140]  Now, we're fighting them hard in cyberspace.
[03:19:11.140 --> 03:19:14.780]  We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension, but one of the biggest places
[03:19:14.780 --> 03:19:20.060]  that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.
[03:19:20.060 --> 03:19:25.300]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from ForrestLife.com, I couldn't do it.
[03:19:25.300 --> 03:19:29.660]  That's why we decided to take our original Secret 12 that was incredibly high quality
[03:19:29.660 --> 03:19:35.380]  Methylcobalamin and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12.
[03:19:35.380 --> 03:19:40.260]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12 over the counter that you're going
[03:19:40.260 --> 03:19:41.260]  to find anywhere.
[03:19:41.260 --> 03:19:46.420]  It is amazing, experience pure Methylcobalamin B12 for yourself, and fund the Second American
[03:19:46.420 --> 03:19:57.500]  Revolution against the tyrants at InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or AAA-253-3139.
[03:19:57.500 --> 03:20:05.820]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:20:05.820 --> 03:20:12.700]  I appreciate my atoms.
[03:20:12.700 --> 03:20:40.780]  You know, I don't know how to handle this paradox of how do you focus on what bad guys
[03:20:40.780 --> 03:20:46.420]  are doing and stop them without having it upset you, because just looking at that fat
[03:20:46.420 --> 03:20:51.940]  pervert with pink lipstick talking about how parents can't come and I'm organizing 12-year-old
[03:20:51.940 --> 03:20:56.820]  topless girls to come meet with me and, you know, just, it's all about children.
[03:20:56.820 --> 03:20:57.900]  It's all sexualization.
[03:20:57.900 --> 03:21:01.540]  It's all sick, but they've learned to just do it out in the open instead of creeping
[03:21:01.540 --> 03:21:04.980]  around at parks or whatever, driving around in, you know, white minivans.
[03:21:04.980 --> 03:21:07.980]  So I'm going to get the clip I wanted to play.
[03:21:07.980 --> 03:21:08.980]  I wasn't clear to the crew.
[03:21:08.980 --> 03:21:10.980]  That was another clip where I called in.
[03:21:10.980 --> 03:21:16.620]  I'm going to play the other clip when we come back, but here's the big news.
[03:21:16.620 --> 03:21:22.780]  Current senior Google engineer, there's hours of this video, goes public on camera saying
[03:21:22.780 --> 03:21:30.580]  tech is dangerous in taking sites, and it's powerful, and it's on InfoWars.com, it's on
[03:21:30.580 --> 03:21:37.580]  NewsWars.com, it's on Project Veritas.com, but I want to be very, very clear about this.
[03:21:37.580 --> 03:21:43.100]  Looks like a punch in the stomach that a month ago, all that undercover video of the head
[03:21:43.100 --> 03:21:47.780]  executive, the director of Google's new projects.
[03:21:47.780 --> 03:21:50.100]  That's all their projects, including censorship.
[03:21:50.100 --> 03:21:52.580]  Bragg, Trump will not be re-elected.
[03:21:52.580 --> 03:21:53.580]  We're going to stop him.
[03:21:53.580 --> 03:21:54.700]  We control the algorithm.
[03:21:54.700 --> 03:21:55.900]  We're blocking everything.
[03:21:55.900 --> 03:21:57.340]  We're blocking voters.
[03:21:57.340 --> 03:21:58.340]  It comes out.
[03:21:58.340 --> 03:22:01.060]  It's barely news and then goes away.
[03:22:01.060 --> 03:22:05.860]  Well, here's something just as big.
[03:22:05.860 --> 03:22:11.460]  The insider, it's time to decide, do we run a technology or does the technology run us?
[03:22:11.460 --> 03:22:15.500]  Well, technocracies where technology runs you under an oligarchy.
[03:22:15.500 --> 03:22:20.100]  I really don't buy the idea that big tech is politically neutral.
[03:22:20.100 --> 03:22:26.620]  Are we going to just let big tech companies decide who wins every election or who doesn't?
[03:22:26.620 --> 03:22:31.980]  And so here it is, Project Veritas has published an on-the-record interview with Insider who
[03:22:31.980 --> 03:22:36.100]  works at Google named Greg Coppola.
[03:22:36.100 --> 03:22:40.220]  The video interview follows a series of insider Google reports, including internal Google
[03:22:40.220 --> 03:22:43.260]  documents recently published by Project Veritas.
[03:22:43.260 --> 03:22:44.940]  And here's why they're so scared.
[03:22:44.940 --> 03:22:48.540]  They want to get the machines in place and not need to have humans anymore, show that
[03:22:48.540 --> 03:22:49.820]  humans won't rat them out.
[03:22:49.820 --> 03:22:50.820]  So we're at that crossroads.
[03:22:50.820 --> 03:22:53.820]  It's why this is so mega-critical.
[03:22:53.820 --> 03:22:58.460]  And quite frankly, I almost started the show with this today, but we're kind of ending
[03:22:58.460 --> 03:22:59.500]  it with it instead.
[03:22:59.500 --> 03:23:03.300]  It's so important and a sea of things are important.
[03:23:03.300 --> 03:23:04.300]  This is a big deal.
[03:23:04.300 --> 03:23:09.580]  And it's on infowars.com right now, and only you can get it out there.
[03:23:09.580 --> 03:23:11.700]  Remember, YouTube blocked their last video.
[03:23:11.700 --> 03:23:12.700]  YouTube's trying to block this.
[03:23:12.700 --> 03:23:15.260]  Well, that's why we have infowars.com.
[03:23:15.260 --> 03:23:18.380]  It's why we have our own uploading systems, why we have our own videos, so we're building
[03:23:18.380 --> 03:23:20.940]  a system like YouTube right now at great expense.
[03:23:20.940 --> 03:23:23.260]  That's not a secret project.
[03:23:23.260 --> 03:23:27.220]  I have approved and we're about to green light, and we've already green-lighted.
[03:23:27.220 --> 03:23:28.220]  We're about to launch.
[03:23:28.220 --> 03:23:35.660]  We're in launch phase of some things that I don't want the credit for.
[03:23:35.660 --> 03:23:40.700]  I just want you to know we're doing more than just what you see here.
[03:23:40.700 --> 03:23:45.980]  And you're going to see some big stuff out there very, very soon.
[03:23:45.980 --> 03:23:50.100]  There's a lot of big things you already see out there that your money is behind.
[03:23:50.100 --> 03:23:52.300]  Your money.
[03:23:52.300 --> 03:23:53.300]  I'm here to win.
[03:23:53.300 --> 03:23:57.340]  And again, I get too obsessed with winning, I get too obsessed with, I get pissed, and
[03:23:57.340 --> 03:24:00.740]  I apologize to everybody on here that I get mean sometimes and blow up.
[03:24:00.740 --> 03:24:02.940]  That's not an act.
[03:24:02.940 --> 03:24:03.940]  But this is real.
[03:24:03.940 --> 03:24:04.940]  This is a real fight.
[03:24:04.940 --> 03:24:05.940]  This isn't Netflix.
[03:24:05.940 --> 03:24:06.940]  It's not entertainment.
[03:24:06.940 --> 03:24:07.940]  It's not a simulation.
[03:24:07.940 --> 03:24:08.940]  It's not a video game.
[03:24:08.940 --> 03:24:12.100]  You lose this game, you get killed, and so does every future generation.
[03:24:12.100 --> 03:24:16.420]  So here's the Google executive putting his whole life on the line, his name on the line,
[03:24:16.420 --> 03:24:17.420]  everything.
[03:24:17.420 --> 03:24:18.420]  Here it is.
[03:24:18.420 --> 03:24:21.620]  It's the time to decide, you know, do we run the technology?
[03:24:21.620 --> 03:24:22.980]  Does the technology run us?
[03:24:22.980 --> 03:24:25.020]  Are we going to continue to have elections that mean anything?
[03:24:25.020 --> 03:24:29.020]  Are we going to continue to think for ourselves?
[03:24:29.020 --> 03:24:34.860]  Or are we going to just let the biggest tech companies decide who wins every election from
[03:24:34.860 --> 03:24:35.860]  now on?
[03:24:35.860 --> 03:24:42.700]  You know, I look at search, and I look at Google News, and I see what it's doing, and
[03:24:42.700 --> 03:24:47.860]  I see Google executives go to Congress and say that it's not manipulated, it's not political.
[03:24:47.860 --> 03:24:50.140]  And I'm just so sure that's not true.
[03:24:50.140 --> 03:24:54.500]  I think the big problem that we have today is there is an ambiguity about whether tech
[03:24:54.500 --> 03:24:57.780]  is new, or whether it's biased, and, you know-
[03:24:57.780 --> 03:24:59.900]  Oh, hit pause real quick.
[03:24:59.900 --> 03:25:03.420]  This guy's signed more non-disclosure agreements than you can shake a stick at.
[03:25:03.420 --> 03:25:06.060]  So remember, he says, I'm just totally sure they're doing it.
[03:25:06.060 --> 03:25:09.180]  He can't tell you because he's signed the non-disclosure.
[03:25:09.180 --> 03:25:10.180]  Continue.
[03:25:10.180 --> 03:25:17.700]  This PhD in computer science and five years of working at one of the world's top computer
[03:25:17.700 --> 03:25:26.340]  science companies, I don't see any doubt that it's very politically biased.
[03:25:26.340 --> 03:25:31.900]  They may be able to stop one man, but they can't stop all of us.
[03:25:31.900 --> 03:25:38.020]  Your courage will be contagious, and it will awaken a sleeping giant.
[03:25:38.020 --> 03:25:40.500]  Be a catalyst for change.
[03:25:40.500 --> 03:25:41.500]  Be brave.
[03:25:41.500 --> 03:25:42.500]  Do something.
[03:25:42.500 --> 03:25:55.300]  I don't see any doubt that it's very politically biased.
[03:25:55.300 --> 03:25:57.900]  Bias in big tech is big news.
[03:25:57.900 --> 03:26:01.500]  Just yesterday, the Justice Department launched an antitrust review.
[03:26:01.500 --> 03:26:05.660]  Two weeks ago, I was at the White House summit to talk about big tech with the president
[03:26:05.660 --> 03:26:07.540]  and other influencers.
[03:26:07.540 --> 03:26:12.220]  Project Veritas investigations have been featured in congressional hearings in both the Senate
[03:26:12.220 --> 03:26:13.780]  and the House.
[03:26:13.780 --> 03:26:18.860]  Our momentum is growing, and today, we have another Google Insider, this time out of the
[03:26:18.860 --> 03:26:25.100]  shadows, a brave man who is breaking the wall of silence to go on camera as a current Google
[03:26:25.100 --> 03:26:29.940]  employee and expose a troubling truth.
[03:26:29.940 --> 03:26:30.940]  My name is Greg Coppola.
[03:26:30.940 --> 03:26:32.180]  I'm a senior software engineer.
[03:26:32.180 --> 03:26:35.460]  I work on artificial intelligence and the Google Assistant.
[03:26:35.460 --> 03:26:44.820]  Yeah, I mean, overall, I'm very concerned to see big tech and the big media merge basically
[03:26:44.820 --> 03:26:47.700]  with the political party, with the Democrat party.
[03:26:47.700 --> 03:26:50.660]  Greg Coppola works in Google's New York office.
[03:26:50.660 --> 03:26:56.780]  He says from his Insider's view, the reality of Google's political bias is undeniable.
[03:26:56.780 --> 03:26:57.780]  Don't have a smoking gun.
[03:26:57.780 --> 03:27:00.380]  I just, you know, I've been coding since I was 10.
[03:27:00.380 --> 03:27:01.380]  I have a PhD.
[03:27:01.380 --> 03:27:04.980]  I have five years of experience at Google, and I just know how algorithms are.
[03:27:04.980 --> 03:27:11.340]  They don't write themselves, we write them to do what we want them to do, and you can
[03:27:11.340 --> 03:27:16.700]  use machine learning, but even then, you can get the results of machine learning to come
[03:27:16.700 --> 03:27:17.700]  out the way you want them to.
[03:27:17.700 --> 03:27:19.180]  It's just a tool that we control.
[03:27:19.180 --> 03:27:26.580]  You know, I look at search, and I look at Google News, and I see what it's doing, and
[03:27:26.580 --> 03:27:31.700]  I see Google executives go to Congress and say that it's not manipulated, it's not political,
[03:27:31.700 --> 03:27:35.260]  and I'm just so sure that's not true.
[03:27:35.260 --> 03:27:38.780]  And he's talking about Sundar saying, we never control search results.
[03:27:38.780 --> 03:27:43.260]  The algorithm does it like it fell out from underneath a cabbage patch or came out of
[03:27:43.260 --> 03:27:48.740]  a gypsy wagon somewhere or was, you know, found at the bottom of the ocean.
[03:27:48.740 --> 03:27:52.940]  It's all programmed for what they want, and they're programming at the steel elections.
[03:27:52.940 --> 03:27:54.700]  And more people are going to come forward.
[03:27:54.700 --> 03:28:00.260]  He's told us this publicly and in private, James O'Keefe's problem is he's got so many
[03:28:00.260 --> 03:28:02.020]  whistleblowers, and that's great.
[03:28:02.020 --> 03:28:07.060]  If you're a Google whistleblower, you can also send us an email at showtipsandinfullwars.com
[03:28:07.060 --> 03:28:10.300]  or, you know, contact us because we also want to help out.
[03:28:10.300 --> 03:28:12.020]  We usually send people over to Project Veritas.
[03:28:12.020 --> 03:28:14.980]  You should do that, but they're really overwhelmed, and we're overwhelmed, too.
[03:28:14.980 --> 03:28:19.580]  We're trying to do the best we can, and that's why the frustration is just how naked all
[03:28:19.580 --> 03:28:24.540]  this is, how out in the open, and that we really can't service all the whistleblowers
[03:28:24.540 --> 03:28:25.540]  that are out there.
[03:28:25.540 --> 03:28:26.540]  We tried.
[03:28:26.540 --> 03:28:27.540]  A lot of it falls to the cracks, but we're trying.
[03:28:27.540 --> 03:28:32.740]  We're trying as hard as we can, but it's kind of like we're playing tennis or baseball,
[03:28:32.740 --> 03:28:35.260]  the pitching machines.
[03:28:35.260 --> 03:28:37.740]  Shooting five balls a second, there's just really no way to hit them all.
[03:28:37.740 --> 03:28:40.740]  You just got to use the force and hit the ones that matter.
[03:28:40.740 --> 03:28:53.940]  We'll be right back with something entirely different.
[03:28:53.940 --> 03:28:59.780]  When you have a pain in the neck, a real pain in the neck, back, shoulder, or legs, you
[03:28:59.780 --> 03:29:05.180]  now have two convenient choices to get fast relief without taking another pill.
[03:29:05.180 --> 03:29:10.660]  Because now, Sunny Bay heating wraps and pillows are available at both Amazon and Walmart.
[03:29:10.660 --> 03:29:17.620]  Yes, see Sunny Bay's four and a half to five star customer reviews on Amazon.com or Walmart.com.
[03:29:17.620 --> 03:29:22.500]  Our microwaveable heat wraps, heatable neck pillows, and extra large body wraps are designed
[03:29:22.500 --> 03:29:26.140]  better for perfect support where and when you need it.

[03:29:31.180 --> 03:29:35.100]  hot or cold therapy to help treat temporary or chronic pain.
[03:29:35.100 --> 03:29:39.500]  And the best part, Sunny Bay quality products started under $20.

[03:29:48.380 --> 03:29:54.540]  Visit Amazon or Walmart and search today for Sunny Bay.
[03:29:54.540 --> 03:29:55.540]  Alex.
[03:29:55.540 --> 03:29:56.540]  Yes.
[03:29:56.540 --> 03:29:57.540]  I got a plug for the Patriot points I get.
[03:29:57.540 --> 03:29:58.540]  Oh, thanks.
[03:29:58.540 --> 03:30:01.540]  I got $180 so far this year and I feel like I'm stealing from you.
[03:30:01.540 --> 03:30:04.540]  I buy so much in the store because, I mean, I don't want to give that money to Walmart.
[03:30:04.540 --> 03:30:07.380]  I don't want to give that money to people who are going to donate it to causes I don't
[03:30:07.380 --> 03:30:08.380]  believe in.
[03:30:08.380 --> 03:30:09.380]  So I'd rather give that money to you.
[03:30:09.380 --> 03:30:10.380]  And I'm getting quality products.
[03:30:10.380 --> 03:30:13.100]  The products that I do receive have changed my life.
[03:30:13.100 --> 03:30:15.420]  I mean, the X2 has really done a lot for me.
[03:30:15.420 --> 03:30:16.420]  I've lost weight.
[03:30:16.420 --> 03:30:17.940]  My brain works a whole lot better.
[03:30:17.940 --> 03:30:19.740]  My kid, they use the toothpaste.
[03:30:19.740 --> 03:30:23.900]  My son used to get these little sore throats and he puts X2 in water and drinks it and
[03:30:23.900 --> 03:30:24.900]  it gets rid of his sore throat.
[03:30:24.900 --> 03:30:26.980]  Well, sir, let me break this down for you.
[03:30:26.980 --> 03:30:28.460]  I want high quality stuff in there.
[03:30:28.460 --> 03:30:29.700]  I want a good price.
[03:30:29.700 --> 03:30:33.660]  But I've kind of obituated everybody to where everybody buys when it's 50% off.
[03:30:33.660 --> 03:30:36.060]  I'm making $2 on the toothpaste, 50% off.
[03:30:36.060 --> 03:30:39.700]  And so it's the same thing like the fish oil or the turmeric or the bone broth.
[03:30:39.700 --> 03:30:40.700]  Thank you so much for the plugs.
[03:30:40.700 --> 03:30:44.660]  But listen, when people get the Patriot points, a lot of times it makes things a loss later
[03:30:44.660 --> 03:30:48.900]  because if you're already getting 10% off as you're on auto-ship, then we'll get 50%
[03:30:48.900 --> 03:30:50.700]  off and then you do something like that.
[03:30:50.700 --> 03:30:53.220]  We have Patriot points, we lose money, but that's OK.
[03:30:53.220 --> 03:30:56.380]  Thanks for the support.

[03:31:54.140 --> 03:31:59.620]  Before I started working at InfoWars, I was not only a fan of Alex Jones and InfoWars.com,
[03:31:59.620 --> 03:32:02.260]  but also the products at InfoWarsstore.com.
[03:32:02.260 --> 03:32:08.220]  There's one product that's offered at InfoWarsstore.com that is the elite of the supplements and that's
[03:32:08.220 --> 03:32:09.220]  DNA Force Plus.
[03:32:09.220 --> 03:32:14.020]  Now, I remember when Alex first started talking about this with some of his special guests,
[03:32:14.020 --> 03:32:17.300]  telomeres and telomere support with your DNA.
[03:32:17.300 --> 03:32:22.220]  So I started to look into the science and what telomeres were and how it can improve
[03:32:22.220 --> 03:32:25.740]  your health and longevity when you protect your telomeres.
[03:32:25.740 --> 03:32:29.180]  So I started looking into DNA Force Plus, but it's expensive.
[03:32:29.180 --> 03:32:30.180]  Why?
[03:32:30.180 --> 03:32:32.300]  Because it is an elite supplement.
[03:32:32.300 --> 03:32:36.380]  And then I started seeing other competitors coming up with competitive supplements for
[03:32:36.380 --> 03:32:42.560]  telomere support and they came and they went, but DNA Force Plus is still there.
[03:32:42.560 --> 03:32:44.060]  It is the elite supplement.
[03:32:44.060 --> 03:32:48.860]  I get excited when DNA Force Plus is on sale because I know it's expensive, so you should
[03:32:48.860 --> 03:32:56.980]  take advantage of 50% off DNA Force Plus at InfoWarsstore.com.
[03:32:56.980 --> 03:33:15.420]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:33:15.420 --> 03:33:19.700]  Coming to you from the Burbotan Studios in Austin, Texas to fitting the Republic from
[03:33:19.700 --> 03:33:27.700]  enemies foreign and domestic, our mere existence outrages the chai comes.
[03:33:27.700 --> 03:33:32.740]  There's an article by Adon Salazar that you need to tweet and Facebook and send it on
[03:33:32.740 --> 03:33:36.740]  email and by word of mouth, it needs to be seen.
[03:33:36.740 --> 03:33:40.020]  Video children beat Ice Pinata at party.
[03:33:40.020 --> 03:33:46.060]  I never even got to the video yesterday where in Tennessee they're only doing raids on people
[03:33:46.060 --> 03:33:47.060]  that have felonies.
[03:33:47.060 --> 03:33:50.380]  I mean, we're talking bank robbery, car theft, rape.
[03:33:50.380 --> 03:33:56.740]  I mean, the truth is, as Trump said, 90% are getting released, 10% have prior criminal
[03:33:56.740 --> 03:34:01.140]  things are being sent back, and then Ice is only going out to people with gang affiliations
[03:34:01.140 --> 03:34:02.140]  and stuff.
[03:34:02.140 --> 03:34:05.260]  I mean, my God, there's like 40 million illegal aliens in this country.
[03:34:05.260 --> 03:34:11.420]  But the footage in Tennessee I'll play coming up after this clip is just like trendies out
[03:34:11.420 --> 03:34:16.140]  in their outfits blocking the Ice vehicle that has a warrant and the news is going, those
[03:34:16.140 --> 03:34:20.340]  aren't real warrants, resist them.
[03:34:20.340 --> 03:34:21.620]  It's totally a warrant.
[03:34:21.620 --> 03:34:22.620]  It's a real warrant.
[03:34:22.620 --> 03:34:27.620]  But again, they're trying to get the idea that Nazis are coming to kidnap you.
[03:34:27.620 --> 03:34:32.180]  Folks, when you fly into Mexico, you used to go to Cancun, now it's too dangerous.
[03:34:32.180 --> 03:34:35.380]  You thought of the deal and you say, what hotel you're at, you say the day you're at.
[03:34:35.380 --> 03:34:40.220]  One time, I decided to stay three days extra and I was talking about that on the phone.
[03:34:40.220 --> 03:34:42.460]  He goes, well, you know, they'll call your hotel.
[03:34:42.460 --> 03:34:45.740]  When I didn't fly out that day the next day, they were calling the hotel.
[03:34:45.740 --> 03:34:47.580]  I got called down by security.
[03:34:47.580 --> 03:34:48.580]  I had to get on the phone.
[03:34:48.580 --> 03:34:50.100]  They said, you may have to pay a fine.
[03:34:50.100 --> 03:34:52.020]  You're at the airport for this.
[03:34:52.020 --> 03:34:56.060]  And when I got there, they decided not to, but they were calling the hotel I was at.
[03:34:56.060 --> 03:34:58.140]  Like, hey, you didn't fly out on Southwest.
[03:34:58.140 --> 03:35:01.060]  Like you said, Mexico has control of that.
[03:35:01.060 --> 03:35:02.060]  They better.
[03:35:02.060 --> 03:35:03.260]  They're bordering Central America.
[03:35:03.260 --> 03:35:04.260]  That's a hellhole.
[03:35:04.260 --> 03:35:05.260]  You think Mexico is bad?
[03:35:05.260 --> 03:35:06.260]  Guatemala is even worse.
[03:35:06.260 --> 03:35:07.260]  10 times worse.
[03:35:07.260 --> 03:35:11.540]  Believe me, I had family lived down there for a long time, tried to stabilize the country.
[03:35:11.540 --> 03:35:15.460]  Didn't work.
[03:35:15.460 --> 03:35:16.460]  It's a sickening story.
[03:35:16.460 --> 03:35:23.740]  Actually, if I told you that one, but this is the beating up the pinata.
[03:35:23.740 --> 03:35:28.580]  As ice is the devil and you go out, you've had anti attack to ice facility, fire bomb
[03:35:28.580 --> 03:35:29.580]  and all this.
[03:35:29.580 --> 03:35:34.340]  And it's just insanity when we have the most lax immigration laws and the biggest welfare
[03:35:34.340 --> 03:35:39.780]  other than Sweden and Germany, we're like number three for the most welfare.
[03:35:39.780 --> 03:35:40.780]  Free legal aliens.
[03:35:40.780 --> 03:35:48.460]  But they turned around where she says for life, they've got to be paid because they
[03:35:48.460 --> 03:35:53.700]  went through this pain because their parents or whoever rented the kids brought them up
[03:35:53.700 --> 03:35:55.380]  here through this hell.
[03:35:55.380 --> 03:36:00.980]  And then we checked who they were and we're transformed into Nazis with AOC wagging her
[03:36:00.980 --> 03:36:02.500]  finger at us.
[03:36:02.500 --> 03:36:05.860]  So here it is info wars.com article.
[03:36:05.860 --> 03:36:06.860]  No one will know about it.
[03:36:06.860 --> 03:36:10.060]  If you don't get it out there, children beat ice pinata at party.
[03:36:10.060 --> 03:36:11.660]  Here it is.
[03:36:11.660 --> 03:36:15.860]  Young immigrants in Illinois have more protection now thanks to some new laws.
[03:36:15.860 --> 03:36:20.260]  One lets kids stay with a guardian longer while their parents are detained or deported.
[03:36:20.260 --> 03:36:26.100]  The other allows courts to grant special immigrant juvenile status to victims of abuse or neglect.
[03:36:26.100 --> 03:36:27.780]  The immigration hit pause hit pause.
[03:36:27.780 --> 03:36:30.220]  I read all the laws.
[03:36:30.220 --> 03:36:33.940]  Anyone with a child who doesn't have a prior felony in this country is released.
[03:36:33.940 --> 03:36:36.340]  That's why they bring the kids.
[03:36:36.340 --> 03:36:43.140]  But they spend it like, oh, parents being held while they're children or with somebody
[03:36:43.140 --> 03:36:44.380]  else family.
[03:36:44.380 --> 03:36:49.980]  It's all, everybody's scripted to again just demonize, continue.
[03:36:49.980 --> 03:36:51.340]  The Chicago event.
[03:36:51.340 --> 03:36:56.820]  Children took turns trying to break open this pinata shaped like an ice officer at a block
[03:36:56.820 --> 03:36:57.820]  party.
[03:36:57.820 --> 03:37:01.700]  CBS News Eric Cox is live in the city's east side neighborhood with the story you'll see
[03:37:01.700 --> 03:37:05.620]  only on two, Eric.
[03:37:05.620 --> 03:37:10.060]  Look at that block party took place right here at 106th and Ewing organizers telling
[03:37:10.060 --> 03:37:15.940]  me the event was never meant to be political, but the pinata was a complete surprise.
[03:37:15.940 --> 03:37:21.460]  Tonight's story does feature children were blurring their faces.
[03:37:21.460 --> 03:37:27.740]  A little girl holding a stick swinging away at a pinata in form of an ice agent.
[03:37:27.740 --> 03:37:29.740]  All right, breaking.
[03:37:29.740 --> 03:37:32.940]  Later, a boy takes a crack at it.
[03:37:32.940 --> 03:37:38.100]  And I'll tell you, here's a comment from her doing the brown beret candy filled container.
[03:37:38.100 --> 03:37:42.300]  The older ones, of course, we'd let them know what it meant.
[03:37:42.300 --> 03:37:44.300]  We'll teach them what it meant.
[03:37:44.300 --> 03:37:50.420]  Anthony Martinez has the Chicago faction of Los Brown Berets approach icono activist group
[03:37:50.420 --> 03:37:56.460]  that ordered a Batman pinata and the brown beret shape for those inside the race, everything
[03:37:56.460 --> 03:37:58.140]  for those outside the race, nothing.
[03:37:58.140 --> 03:37:59.140]  It's basically the KKK.
[03:37:59.140 --> 03:38:00.140]  But they're not.
[03:38:00.140 --> 03:38:02.140]  Oh, it's this great new loving great.
[03:38:02.140 --> 03:38:09.420]  Young immigrants calls cruel deportation practices taking children from their parents
[03:38:09.420 --> 03:38:10.420]  separating them.
[03:38:10.420 --> 03:38:14.100]  Plus again, you're begging to get in the country to get all the free crap.
[03:38:14.100 --> 03:38:16.340]  And obviously, this guy's on welfare.
[03:38:16.340 --> 03:38:19.100]  He's obviously super stupid.
[03:38:19.100 --> 03:38:22.940]  He's in a little commando outfit, telling us how he to give him more free stuff.
[03:38:22.940 --> 03:38:25.060]  I mean, you know, who's more pathetic than him?
[03:38:25.060 --> 03:38:26.060]  We are.
[03:38:26.060 --> 03:38:27.060]  Here he is.
[03:38:27.060 --> 03:38:29.780]  It is here in this community.
[03:38:29.780 --> 03:38:35.220]  This posted online shows several other children in line waiting to take a swing at the political
[03:38:35.220 --> 03:38:41.700]  pinata, the photos garnering fans on Facebook, but drawing ire from others, some calling
[03:38:41.700 --> 03:38:45.820]  it ignorant, disrespectful and teaching the young to hate.
[03:38:45.820 --> 03:38:49.380]  The kids who were breaking open a piano didn't know anything about it.
[03:38:49.380 --> 03:38:55.300]  Marvin Covington is a member of the Eastside Chamber of Commerce, a group of over 25 Eastside
[03:38:55.300 --> 03:39:02.300]  area businesses that organized the mid-July event Covington tells CBS to the chamber wasn't
[03:39:02.300 --> 03:39:05.100]  aware the pinata would be present.
[03:39:05.100 --> 03:39:07.700]  It wasn't a sense of this is terrible.
[03:39:07.700 --> 03:39:11.020]  I said, okay, it was this is something that happened.
[03:39:11.020 --> 03:39:13.020]  We got to move on.
[03:39:13.020 --> 03:39:14.340]  So there's the communist group.
[03:39:14.340 --> 03:39:15.340]  That's enough.
[03:39:15.340 --> 03:39:20.540]  Apart for the course, ladies and gentlemen, it's all it's all the same thing over and
[03:39:20.540 --> 03:39:22.260]  over and over again.
[03:39:22.260 --> 03:39:25.060]  Now, I'm not going to air this whole thing is want to come back at something even more
[03:39:25.060 --> 03:39:26.060]  important.
[03:39:26.060 --> 03:39:29.100]  But here's where I shot a video and they were doing the live show yesterday, so they could
[03:39:29.100 --> 03:39:33.940]  air my question during Owen Shroyer's war room that's 20 minutes from now, where they
[03:39:33.940 --> 03:39:40.580]  had this man, this obese man with pink lipstick who says he wants to meet with 12 year old
[03:39:40.580 --> 03:39:44.220]  girls with their tops off, no parents allowed and the government's like absolutely love
[03:39:44.220 --> 03:39:45.220]  it.
[03:39:45.220 --> 03:39:46.220]  Here he is.
[03:39:46.220 --> 03:39:50.100]  And here is where I stood will basically was a little bit meaner to him than I was
[03:39:50.100 --> 03:39:51.100]  during my own show.
[03:39:51.100 --> 03:39:52.100]  Here it is.
[03:39:52.100 --> 03:39:54.300]  Jessica, you were on my show today.
[03:39:54.300 --> 03:39:55.900]  Now you're on the war room.
[03:39:55.900 --> 03:40:00.380]  And I don't look down on you that you were born a man, but you think you're a woman.
[03:40:00.380 --> 03:40:01.380]  That's your choice.
[03:40:01.380 --> 03:40:06.100]  But the questions I didn't get to while you were on haunt me.
[03:40:06.100 --> 03:40:12.900]  We see drag queen story time from Europe to Canada, the U.S. with children being brought
[03:40:12.900 --> 03:40:17.940]  and put in people's laps that are dressed up like clowns.
[03:40:17.940 --> 03:40:21.020]  The individuals then tell the kids about shake your booty.
[03:40:21.020 --> 03:40:27.860]  In cases they ride horsey on the men and the whole thing has a very pedophilic feel and
[03:40:27.860 --> 03:40:32.860]  a lot of the people it turns out running drag queen story time and say Houston, Texas or
[03:40:32.860 --> 03:40:35.860]  other cities are convicted pedophiles.
[03:40:35.860 --> 03:40:41.140]  Then we see Desmond is amazing or the amazing Desmond from the time he was like eight years
[03:40:41.140 --> 03:40:42.140]  old.
[03:40:42.140 --> 03:40:46.180]  I was like 11 at gay bars men throwing money at him and pedophile groups saying how sexy
[03:40:46.180 --> 03:40:52.700]  he is, this whole trans movement, the whole drag queen movement, it's all connected to
[03:40:52.700 --> 03:41:00.620]  sex with children or the sexualization of children and the destruction of their youth
[03:41:00.620 --> 03:41:01.620]  or innocence.
[03:41:01.620 --> 03:41:06.180]  And so that's why people are so scared and that's why they see photos of you in bathrooms
[03:41:06.180 --> 03:41:11.140]  and they see you inviting 12 year olds to events.
[03:41:11.140 --> 03:41:14.060]  You're having would say, you know, don't, you know, parents don't be there.
[03:41:14.060 --> 03:41:16.660]  I mean, I've got three daughters.
[03:41:16.660 --> 03:41:21.220]  There was some man or woman saying I want your daughters to come have a topless swimming
[03:41:21.220 --> 03:41:22.220]  party.
[03:41:22.220 --> 03:41:24.620]  I don't want any parents there.
[03:41:24.620 --> 03:41:27.420]  That sounds like pedophilia 101 Jeffrey Epstein.
[03:41:27.420 --> 03:41:30.540]  So I kind of got that question in but you dodged it.
[03:41:30.540 --> 03:41:32.060]  Answer the question now.
[03:41:32.060 --> 03:41:37.340]  How is 12 year old girls meeting with a man or a woman at a pool and saying your parents
[03:41:37.340 --> 03:41:39.660]  shouldn't come?
[03:41:39.660 --> 03:41:42.940]  That sounds like what you do if you're going to kidnap people or something.
[03:41:42.940 --> 03:41:45.900]  It sounds like what you do if you were a pedophile.
[03:41:45.900 --> 03:41:49.820]  So do you want to denounce that right now?
[03:41:49.820 --> 03:41:53.060]  That perspective and tell us how we're wrong and tell us why you want a bunch of little
[03:41:53.060 --> 03:41:57.620]  girls at 12 years old to show up and take their tops off with you, but no parents should
[03:41:57.620 --> 03:41:58.620]  be there.
[03:41:58.620 --> 03:42:03.260]  Answer that question, Jessica, because the whole world's watching and the whole world
[03:42:03.260 --> 03:42:05.300]  wants to know.
[03:42:05.300 --> 03:42:07.780]  Okay.
[03:42:07.780 --> 03:42:10.980]  So again, this is not my event.
[03:42:10.980 --> 03:42:20.180]  If you pull up that, if you pull up the LGBTQ bodies, this dude, this guy, this man BS the
[03:42:20.180 --> 03:42:21.180]  whole time.
[03:42:21.180 --> 03:42:22.180]  He's the guy promoted it, pushed it.
[03:42:22.180 --> 03:42:23.180]  It's all crap.
[03:42:23.180 --> 03:42:24.180]  He's backed off because you know it didn't work.
[03:42:24.180 --> 03:42:25.180]  He pushed, pushed, pushed.
[03:42:25.180 --> 03:42:27.380]  Now he's using what he did to get publicity.
[03:42:27.380 --> 03:42:28.380]  It's all a little crap.
[03:42:28.380 --> 03:42:31.660]  They have all the photos, everything's disgusting, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:42:31.660 --> 03:42:34.460]  That's how far this has gone.
[03:42:34.460 --> 03:42:37.740]  Imagine if like the football coach said, bring your 12 year old daughters over alone for
[03:42:37.740 --> 03:42:38.740]  topless.
[03:42:38.740 --> 03:42:39.740]  He'd be arrested.
[03:42:39.740 --> 03:42:46.740]  Well, when a guy's wearing pink lipstick, they go, oh, oh, oh, I'm, yeah, they go, oh,
[03:42:46.740 --> 03:42:53.860]  yeah, oh, oh.
[03:42:53.860 --> 03:42:55.660]  Robert Barnes, what has Big Tech become?
[03:42:55.660 --> 03:42:59.020]  Big Tech are big babies that have become big bullies and the way they did so is because
[03:42:59.020 --> 03:43:03.460]  they face no consequence of social, economic, political or legal for their illicit activities
[03:43:03.460 --> 03:43:04.460]  over two decades.
[03:43:04.460 --> 03:43:07.820]  And because of that, that's why the courts, the judges, the juries, the members of the
[03:43:07.820 --> 03:43:11.140]  independent free press that care about this, the ordinary members of the public and the
[03:43:11.140 --> 03:43:15.420]  audience that care about this have to bring real social, political, economic consequence
[03:43:15.420 --> 03:43:16.420]  to their course of conduct.
[03:43:16.420 --> 03:43:20.260]  Otherwise they will never change and they will become the big tech oligarchs, the equivalent
[03:43:20.260 --> 03:43:24.220]  to the big trust of the 19th century, who ran American politics and ran American economy
[03:43:24.220 --> 03:43:27.620]  almost into the ground until we were able to recover after the Great Depression.
[03:43:27.620 --> 03:43:32.540]  The inforward's audience is the fuel that flames the light of liberty across the world
[03:43:32.540 --> 03:43:36.940]  to make real the actions of independent free speech, to make real the original promise
[03:43:36.940 --> 03:43:38.420]  of an independent free press.
[03:43:38.420 --> 03:43:42.940]  Real collusion is Big Tech and big media manipulating and working with each other, to try to meddle
[03:43:42.940 --> 03:43:44.940]  with elections, to try to shake people's thoughts.
[03:43:44.940 --> 03:43:47.940]  And then the whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening.
[03:43:47.940 --> 03:43:49.740]  It's the ultimate form of gaslighting.
[03:43:49.740 --> 03:43:51.660]  What you just saw isn't what you just saw.
[03:43:51.660 --> 03:43:53.580]  Even it is what you just saw.
[03:43:53.580 --> 03:44:00.100]  As we witness the most disastrous geological activity in recorded history, the globalists
[03:44:00.100 --> 03:44:05.140]  are backed into a corner and the leftists are pushing for civil war.
[03:44:05.140 --> 03:44:08.900]  Stores are being broken and sovereignty is being challenged.
[03:44:08.900 --> 03:44:15.820]  The world is going to change and how it changes will likely be decided by those who are prepared
[03:44:15.820 --> 03:44:19.020]  to stay strong when the system fails.
[03:44:19.020 --> 03:44:25.180]  The system is vulnerable, electricity could be gone in an instant and grocery stores could
[03:44:25.180 --> 03:44:27.540]  be empty in three days.
[03:44:27.540 --> 03:44:33.020]  Having storable foods and the ability to purify water will give you a fighting chance in the

[03:45:54.780 --> 03:46:01.660]  As we gather this evening in the joy of freedom, we remember that all share a truly extraordinary
[03:46:01.660 --> 03:46:02.660]  heritage.
[03:46:02.660 --> 03:46:09.020]  Together, we are part of one of the greatest stories ever told, the story of America.
[03:46:09.020 --> 03:46:14.420]  It is the epic tale of a great nation whose people have risked everything for what they
[03:46:14.420 --> 03:46:18.820]  know is right and what they know is true.
[03:46:18.820 --> 03:46:25.180]  As long as we stay true to our codes, as long as we remember our great history, as long
[03:46:25.180 --> 03:46:32.500]  as we never, ever stop fighting for a better future, then there will be nothing that America
[03:46:32.500 --> 03:46:45.060]  can not do.
[03:46:45.060 --> 03:47:13.860]  Welcome back, I'm Alex Jones, your host, you know, I don't like to agree with CNN, but
[03:47:13.860 --> 03:47:17.820]  I've been saying since this morning, this was a big derailment, a big defeat for the
[03:47:17.820 --> 03:47:18.820]  Democrats.
[03:47:18.820 --> 03:47:24.060]  Well, the headline at infowars.com and newswars.com, I apologize for watching as the video there,
[03:47:24.060 --> 03:47:26.380]  maybe they'll play on the war room coming up in about 15 minutes.
[03:47:26.380 --> 03:47:31.340]  It'll start to 13 minutes with Owen Shroyer, CNN admits Mueller testimony of victory lap
[03:47:31.340 --> 03:47:35.980]  for Trump, hearing did not make impeachment more likely.
[03:47:35.980 --> 03:47:39.220]  And that's because it totally fell flat on its face.
[03:47:39.220 --> 03:47:44.380]  Michael Moore, Dems were lame for putting faith in frail old man, Robert Mueller.
[03:47:44.380 --> 03:47:46.620]  Well, he certainly was frail.
[03:47:46.620 --> 03:47:50.140]  He's been nothing but a sellout of nobody his whole life.
[03:47:50.140 --> 03:47:55.140]  These pathetic lawyers behind him are all in power trips, but you're not in power anymore,
[03:47:55.140 --> 03:47:57.780]  dirt bags, you have nothing.
[03:47:57.780 --> 03:48:02.740]  As soon as your teeth were pulled off our arteries.
[03:48:02.740 --> 03:48:05.140]  So a lot of exciting things happening.
[03:48:05.140 --> 03:48:10.220]  This is powerful for radio, but it's really powerful for video just having some fun constitutional
[03:48:10.220 --> 03:48:16.300]  lawyer Robert Barnes, the full videos up on infowars.com, watch Alex Jones, Robert Barnes
[03:48:16.300 --> 03:48:22.540]  exercise their second amendment firing full auto, the local range called the range in Austin.
[03:48:22.540 --> 03:48:23.740]  He was here just a few weeks ago.
[03:48:23.740 --> 03:48:25.740]  By the way, we did put this out to the day.
[03:48:25.740 --> 03:48:26.740]  I've been so busy.
[03:48:26.740 --> 03:48:27.980]  It's been done for weeks.
[03:48:27.980 --> 03:48:30.100]  He'll be back this Sunday.
[03:48:30.100 --> 03:48:33.340]  He's going to be here with us Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, very popular guy.
[03:48:33.340 --> 03:48:34.340]  I love the guy.
[03:48:34.340 --> 03:48:38.580]  I haven't seen him for years on TV, but just gotten it on the last six months.
[03:48:38.580 --> 03:48:42.260]  He's going to be in studio during clown world too.
[03:48:42.260 --> 03:48:47.700]  With the live 40 plus hour live broadcast, we're going to do covering clown world Tuesday
[03:48:47.700 --> 03:48:48.700]  and Wednesday.
[03:48:48.700 --> 03:48:49.700]  So look for that as well.
[03:48:49.700 --> 03:48:58.020]  But here's a part of that video, Alex Jones here with Robert Barnes and we're at the range
[03:48:58.020 --> 03:49:02.820]  in Austin, one of the most luxurious, but accessible ranges in the country.
[03:49:02.820 --> 03:49:08.860]  This is the Rolls Royce ranges right here in God's country, right here in South Austin
[03:49:08.860 --> 03:49:09.860]  off ice.
[03:49:09.860 --> 03:49:10.860]  We're getting our cigars.
[03:49:10.860 --> 03:49:12.860]  We're getting our full autos ready.
[03:49:12.860 --> 03:49:13.860]  We got a bunch of great guns.
[03:49:13.860 --> 03:49:14.860]  We're going to shoot today.
[03:49:14.860 --> 03:49:18.580]  We're going to have some bourbon smoke these cigars out on the porch a little bit later.
[03:49:18.580 --> 03:49:19.580]  Please stay with us.
[03:49:19.580 --> 03:49:22.740]  This is the stuff that pisses the Commies off.
[03:49:22.740 --> 03:49:27.180]  The unintentional comedy show that was on display this week, the Razzie award winning
[03:49:27.180 --> 03:49:31.340]  competition of the Democratic Party candidates that would easily compete with the attack
[03:49:31.340 --> 03:49:35.420]  of the 50 foot woman or anything like it in what we saw in the Democratic debates where
[03:49:35.420 --> 03:49:40.820]  now not only are they going to decriminalize illegal immigration and make it legal to trespass
[03:49:40.820 --> 03:49:44.540]  and break an enter into the United States, they'll give you a free bonus, not only driver's
[03:49:44.540 --> 03:49:49.460]  licenses and in some cases maybe the opportunity to vote, but a free bonus and free healthcare
[03:49:49.460 --> 03:49:53.820]  for life if you are someone who's not even a citizen who committed a crime to get access
[03:49:53.820 --> 03:49:54.820]  to the country.
[03:49:54.820 --> 03:49:58.580]  That was considered the norm within the Democratic candidate process.
[03:49:58.580 --> 03:50:03.020]  So what you're going to see is an unintentional comedy of the real live clown show, the real
[03:50:03.020 --> 03:50:07.500]  true circus that unveiled in the Democratic debates over the last two nights and you'll
[03:50:07.500 --> 03:50:10.740]  see that the best of coming up in the rest of the show.
[03:50:10.740 --> 03:50:16.420]  By the way, by the way, if you hear those drums of war, we are on top of huge shooting
[03:50:16.420 --> 03:50:20.100]  range below us and a shooting range right through there.
[03:50:20.100 --> 03:50:23.900]  So coming up, we're going to have more of this throughout the evening as we come to
[03:50:23.900 --> 03:50:26.820]  you from the range in South Austin.
[03:50:26.820 --> 03:50:29.340]  Look at this beautiful Gatling gun.
[03:50:29.340 --> 03:50:32.900]  I'm not a gun expert, but what's a Gatling gun, I would imagine this is from the Civil
[03:50:32.900 --> 03:50:33.900]  War era.
[03:50:33.900 --> 03:50:34.900]  Am I right about that?
[03:50:34.900 --> 03:50:35.900]  It is.
[03:50:35.900 --> 03:50:36.900]  Yep.
[03:50:36.900 --> 03:50:40.780]  It was patented always back in the year, started in the 1860s, patented in the 1880s.
[03:50:40.780 --> 03:50:41.780]  Well, it's a cult.
[03:50:41.780 --> 03:50:44.300]  So Nick tells me I'm correct about that.
[03:50:44.300 --> 03:50:46.900]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen, info wars, rapid fire.
[03:50:46.900 --> 03:50:48.340]  I'm going to ask you, what's over here?
[03:50:48.340 --> 03:50:49.340]  Tell us about this.
[03:50:49.340 --> 03:50:51.940]  That's the ammo for the Gatling gun.
[03:50:51.940 --> 03:50:53.460]  Oh, here's the ammo.
[03:50:53.460 --> 03:50:55.460]  Model 1877 Cal 45.
[03:50:55.460 --> 03:51:00.740]  And then we've got Gatling Colt Manufacturing Co Hartford, Connecticut.
[03:51:00.740 --> 03:51:05.420]  Of course, there's no gun manufacturers in Connecticut anymore, a Democrat sued Remington
[03:51:05.420 --> 03:51:06.900]  and others out of existence.
[03:51:06.900 --> 03:51:10.140]  Aren't they good Americans on the payroll of the Chai comms?
[03:51:10.140 --> 03:51:14.580]  So this is the Zena Farms H&K MP5 clone.
[03:51:14.580 --> 03:51:22.140]  It's produced in Turkey, but it's got the same exact operating system designed by HK.
[03:51:22.140 --> 03:51:27.740]  This operating system has been around for a very long time, and it's been used by military
[03:51:27.740 --> 03:51:53.740]  and police forces around the world.
[03:51:53.740 --> 03:52:00.740]  It's definitely got a headache.
[03:52:00.740 --> 03:52:19.740]  We're going to get Bob to shoot this full auto first.
[03:52:19.740 --> 03:52:48.740]  We're going to get Bob to shoot this full auto first, and then we're going to get Bob to
[03:52:48.740 --> 03:52:51.580]  shoot this full auto first.
[03:52:51.580 --> 03:52:53.500]  Only in America, baby.
[03:52:53.500 --> 03:52:56.820]  Well Bob, you grew up in Tennessee, but you were telling me you've been a busy guy, not
[03:52:56.820 --> 03:52:59.380]  a huge gun enthusiast.
[03:52:59.380 --> 03:53:03.660]  What did you think after you had a chance to shoot full auto and some of these other great
[03:53:03.660 --> 03:53:04.660]  firearms?
[03:53:04.660 --> 03:53:08.140]  You see the extraordinary fun of it, the hobby of it, the power that it displays, and the
[03:53:08.140 --> 03:53:12.460]  power that the left perceives as dangerous and violent really is a protective power.
[03:53:12.460 --> 03:53:16.580]  It has been the foundational protective power for freedom for people around the world.
[03:53:16.580 --> 03:53:19.420]  And when you get to experience it, when you get to live it, when you get to go through
[03:53:19.420 --> 03:53:23.100]  it, when you get to imagine it, you understand what people who have defended this country
[03:53:23.100 --> 03:53:26.860]  from its inception went through and understood, and you get to join in their experience of
[03:53:26.860 --> 03:53:31.340]  the joy and the protective embrace that a gun ownership provides.
[03:53:31.340 --> 03:53:35.460]  Well you were pretty good shot though, I mean how much firearm experience you had?
[03:53:35.460 --> 03:53:36.460]  Very little.
[03:53:36.460 --> 03:53:39.820]  So I got some friends and they got mountains in Tennessee that they have property on, so
[03:53:39.820 --> 03:53:42.500]  I've gone up and shot a wide range of weapons in that context.
[03:53:42.500 --> 03:53:46.420]  Las Vegas has a lot of great gun ranges of all kinds of guns that judge every other thing
[03:53:46.420 --> 03:53:47.420]  you can imagine.
[03:53:47.420 --> 03:53:48.420]  What do you think of the range?
[03:53:48.420 --> 03:53:52.340]  This is kind of the model now in the country, these really fancy, nice ranges are going
[03:53:52.340 --> 03:53:53.340]  on.
[03:53:53.340 --> 03:53:54.340]  I love the people, this is a great experience.
[03:53:54.340 --> 03:53:58.020]  Well it's old school America, you can smoke cigars, you can drink whiskey, you can shoot
[03:53:58.020 --> 03:54:03.460]  real guns, you can hang out, the restrooms have men on one title and women on the other
[03:54:03.460 --> 03:54:04.460]  title.
[03:54:04.460 --> 03:54:05.460]  I noticed that, that's kind of...
[03:54:05.460 --> 03:54:09.660]  There's no like transgender, unigender, not sure which gender title, there's none of
[03:54:09.660 --> 03:54:10.660]  those.
[03:54:10.660 --> 03:54:13.060]  There's just actual restrooms for effort by gender.
[03:54:13.060 --> 03:54:14.060]  Which is really hateful.
[03:54:14.060 --> 03:54:17.980]  Yeah, they probably should have 48 other restrooms for that gender and that gender and any other
[03:54:17.980 --> 03:54:20.780]  gender and whatever gender people are feeling they're given to.
[03:54:20.780 --> 03:54:22.060]  Exactly, so let's try this out here.
[03:54:22.060 --> 03:54:23.060]  Yeah.
[03:54:23.060 --> 03:54:24.060]  Here's to America.
[03:54:24.060 --> 03:54:28.140]  Sweet corn, Tennessee, Texas whiskey, cheers.
[03:54:28.140 --> 03:54:34.660]  Why do you think they're sliding so insanely towards the left?
[03:54:34.660 --> 03:54:35.660]  I think it's two things.
[03:54:35.660 --> 03:54:40.020]  You've seen a radicalization of the left in just the last four or five years created
[03:54:40.020 --> 03:54:45.100]  by millennial culture taking over social media, taking over a lot of journalism, creating
[03:54:45.100 --> 03:54:48.660]  clickbait journalism that has a sort of replicating effect.
[03:54:48.660 --> 03:54:51.380]  Because the clickbait journalism leads to it being shared by a bunch of millennials
[03:54:51.380 --> 03:54:56.340]  on social media that increasingly shut down any dissident voices and then that is reinforced
[03:54:56.340 --> 03:55:00.020]  by Google searches and that's reinforced by the New York Times covering it.
[03:55:00.020 --> 03:55:01.500]  The New York Times has had an explosion.
[03:55:01.500 --> 03:55:07.660]  So is that cascading radicalization like an Islam or a life supremacy with the Nazis?
[03:55:07.660 --> 03:55:12.100]  The most extreme become the leader and then it just becomes more extreme, more extreme.
[03:55:12.100 --> 03:55:13.100]  It goes down.
[03:55:13.100 --> 03:55:17.300]  It just expands exponentially and sucks you into a black hole of ideology that even though
[03:55:17.300 --> 03:55:22.740]  the whole country doesn't want it becomes mainstreamed within the power provinces of
[03:55:22.740 --> 03:55:23.740]  the Democratic Party.
[03:55:23.740 --> 03:55:25.020]  So it's all one upping and the orthodoxy?
[03:55:25.020 --> 03:55:26.020]  Absolutely.
[03:55:26.020 --> 03:55:27.020]  It keeps going and going and going.
[03:55:27.020 --> 03:55:31.620]  I mean, for example, the New York Times just five or six years ago, their main reference
[03:55:31.620 --> 03:55:34.820]  point to illegal immigration was to say illegal immigrants.
[03:55:34.820 --> 03:55:37.500]  Just 10 years ago it was to call it say illegal alien.
[03:55:37.500 --> 03:55:41.300]  Now it is almost never used and instead the word undocumented just came out of nowhere
[03:55:41.300 --> 03:55:45.580]  and then now it's migrant and now we got to give them free everything and that's just
[03:55:45.580 --> 03:55:46.580]  the way it is.
[03:55:46.580 --> 03:55:49.860]  And they all said, yeah, free for anybody that can get here, but what about how we got
[03:55:49.860 --> 03:55:50.860]  to pay for it?
[03:55:50.860 --> 03:55:51.860]  Precisely.
[03:55:51.860 --> 03:55:55.940]  And if you go on top of that, you look at NPR today apologized for simply using the term
[03:55:55.940 --> 03:55:56.940]  illegal immigrant.
[03:55:56.940 --> 03:56:01.220]  So within five years, Obama's policies on immigration, which were already to the left,
[03:56:01.220 --> 03:56:06.060]  are now too conservative for every single serious Democratic candidate for the president.
[03:56:06.060 --> 03:56:07.940]  But it's beyond just the echo chamber.
[03:56:07.940 --> 03:56:12.980]  If you read the WikiLeaks, they say we've got an intensified culture of war we're losing.
[03:56:12.980 --> 03:56:18.300]  They're just going with race warfare because they actually believe the minorities are stupid
[03:56:18.300 --> 03:56:23.420]  and will sell out their birthright as Americans in the name of just racial manipulation.
[03:56:23.420 --> 03:56:26.900]  They're creating a sort of an echo chamber such that nobody can challenge it and contest
[03:56:26.900 --> 03:56:28.820]  it within the political arena to make it.
[03:56:28.820 --> 03:56:34.500]  They're moving the Overton window so far in the radical left that while we're busy fighting
[03:56:34.500 --> 03:56:36.620]  the drag of the left, we lose who we are.
[03:56:36.620 --> 03:56:40.740]  Knowing that, it's the ideas that they want to inject would destroy the idea of borders.
[03:56:40.740 --> 03:56:45.460]  You had Elisa Milano on the other day call the border a quote unquote arbitrary line.
[03:56:45.460 --> 03:56:49.140]  So it's trying to obliterate certain ideas in a radical fashion.
[03:56:49.140 --> 03:56:52.500]  And here's the thing, if all those countries said it's an arbitrary line, and I can go
[03:56:52.500 --> 03:56:54.140]  there and get free stuff, it would be.
[03:56:54.140 --> 03:56:55.140]  Exactly.
[03:56:55.140 --> 03:56:57.140]  We've got a bunch of free stuff and nobody else does.
[03:56:57.140 --> 03:56:58.140]  What happens?
[03:56:58.140 --> 03:56:59.340]  We've got a lifeboat.
[03:56:59.340 --> 03:57:00.340]  Nobody else does.
[03:57:00.340 --> 03:57:01.340]  What happens?
[03:57:01.340 --> 03:57:09.260]  I'm Alex Jones, my good buddy over here, Robert Barnes, promote the beautiful ashes,
[03:57:09.260 --> 03:57:12.660]  fellow, promote the freedom and fight for your rights.
[03:57:12.660 --> 03:57:14.660]  Thanks for your support.
[03:57:14.660 --> 03:57:16.660]  Fun little video there.
[03:57:16.660 --> 03:57:18.980]  I'm going to go out of ranch though and really blow some stuff up.
[03:57:18.980 --> 03:57:20.860]  Some Tannerites, some good gun videos.
[03:57:20.860 --> 03:57:21.860]  That was fun.
[03:57:21.860 --> 03:57:25.700]  We didn't even show the video where Barnes was shooting really good full auto.
[03:57:25.700 --> 03:57:28.020]  I was shooting like right in the chest with full off.
[03:57:28.020 --> 03:57:29.020]  It's a fun stuff to do.
[03:57:29.020 --> 03:57:30.020]  Okay.
[03:57:30.020 --> 03:57:31.020]  The war room's coming up.
[03:57:31.020 --> 03:57:34.740]  Sorry, the callers I didn't get to, and we'll be back tomorrow as well.
[03:57:34.740 --> 03:57:38.420]  But the war room starts with the old Troyer right now, infowars.com.
[03:57:38.420 --> 03:57:43.620]  Please tell folks about that show coming up.
[03:57:43.620 --> 03:57:48.260]  Imagine if somebody told you 20 years ago that in the future, universities would be
[03:57:48.260 --> 03:57:53.140]  saying don't use the term America or American, and that American flags would be seen as offensive
[03:57:53.140 --> 03:57:57.180]  and that federal courts would be ruling that it's a hate symbol.
[03:57:57.180 --> 03:57:58.460]  That's all happening.
[03:57:58.460 --> 03:58:00.900]  The left are fascist authoritarians.
[03:58:00.900 --> 03:58:01.900]  They're bullies.
[03:58:01.900 --> 03:58:02.900]  They're criminals.
[03:58:02.900 --> 03:58:05.340]  And now they're trying to make us take down the American flag.
[03:58:05.340 --> 03:58:09.860]  They're saying the Betsy Ross flag, our original flag is evil when she was an abolitionist,
[03:58:09.860 --> 03:58:15.300]  but people are fighting back in this symbol war, in this information war at infowarstore.com.
[03:58:15.300 --> 03:58:21.300]  They're funding our operation, getting great t-shirts, a bunch of great designs, and standing
[03:58:21.300 --> 03:58:22.300]  up to the globalists.
[03:58:22.300 --> 03:58:25.420]  They're trying to shut down info wars, a true 360 win.
[03:58:25.420 --> 03:58:30.180]  So get your Betsy Ross flags, and don't tread on me, American flags, original designs.
[03:58:30.180 --> 03:58:34.460]  Get infowarstore.com, and stand up to the globalists, stand up to the tyrants, and let
[03:58:34.460 --> 03:59:00.460]  them know, these colors don't run, and we're flying them proud.
[03:59:00.460 --> 03:59:09.260]  That's it, I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency.
[03:59:09.260 --> 03:59:12.060]  It's the only way I think he can be defeated other than assassinating him.
[03:59:12.060 --> 03:59:13.380]  It's a time to be praying, my friend.
[03:59:13.380 --> 03:59:16.580]  I agree entirely, and the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying
[03:59:16.580 --> 03:59:19.500]  to shut you down, but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[03:59:19.500 --> 03:59:22.460]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old.
[03:59:22.460 --> 03:59:26.180]  I would love to see what you're talking about when you're 80, but if they do shut you down,
[03:59:26.180 --> 03:59:31.100]  I know you've gone into this war, you've won a lot of battles, and there are a lot of people
[03:59:31.100 --> 03:59:33.860]  like myself and many others who are going to continue.
[03:59:33.860 --> 03:59:37.420]  We're going to keep fighting in the info war, and even if something does happen to you or
[03:59:37.420 --> 03:59:42.300]  your show, know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[03:59:42.300 --> 03:59:51.220]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[03:59:51.220 --> 04:00:05.860]  Okay.
