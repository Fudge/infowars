[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:16.000]  Intro
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000]  It's Wednesday, April 12th, 2023.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:45.000]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:59.000]  Steve Bannon is joining us with really important information and intelligence in 15 minutes.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000]  We have more guests as well, I'll tell you about.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000]  This news is so big that I'm not going to say it with a bunch of excitement.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000]  I'm just going to say it very calmly.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000]  We are kicking New World Order ass right now.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000]  But they are trying to openly, as you already know, get us deeper into what's already begun, World War III.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000]  Because they are that desperate, they're in that much trouble.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:41.000]  But I was looking at the news this morning and last night, and it really dawned on me that we need to put a compilation together of Trump, Robert Kennedy Jr., and Ron Paul, and Elon Musk, and the list goes on and on.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:58.000]  Bolsonaro, Viktor Orban, all coming out and saying there is a global corporate system establishing a worldwide tyranny allied with China, and it's at war with us, and it is a coup.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:27.000]  Just today, you have Trump saying it again, you have Ron Paul, you have Robert Kennedy Jr., all giving speeches saying we have a globalist dictatorship running America,
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000]  and it's already started World War III.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:36.000]  Now, I know you as an audience already know this, and this coup has been ongoing for a while.
[00:02:37.048 --> 00:02:45.048]  But, I've said this probably 5,000 times until your ears bled, and I don't apologize for it.
[00:02:45.048 --> 00:02:49.048]  Because I'm not just here to entertain people. I'm here as an emergency beacon.
[00:02:49.048 --> 00:02:53.048]  So, you may have already gotten the message, or you already knew about it before you ever listened to me.
[00:02:53.048 --> 00:02:56.048]  That's fine. You already are on the team.
[00:02:56.048 --> 00:03:03.048]  We're trying to reach people that aren't aware of what's going on, because the psyche is very fertile right now for people to really wake up.
[00:03:03.048 --> 00:03:13.048]  So, we're a beacon that goes bzzz, bzzz, bzzz, bzzz, bzzz, and sends out that transmission to people to understand what's going on.
[00:03:13.048 --> 00:03:16.048]  So, you've heard me say this literally thousands of times.
[00:03:16.048 --> 00:03:24.048]  When we identify the globalists, and that they're criminal, and they're illegitimate, and they're eugenicists, depopulationists, who are completely psychotic,
[00:03:25.048 --> 00:03:32.048]  and believe they're going to become God-men that merge with machines, Homo sapiens 2.0,
[00:03:32.048 --> 00:03:37.048]  you realize, my gosh, all we can do is resist these people. There's not even a debate about it.
[00:03:37.048 --> 00:03:41.048]  They're coming after 99.99999% of us.
[00:03:41.048 --> 00:03:46.048]  And when we just recognize the elephant in the room, that this is not our government at the top,
[00:03:46.048 --> 00:03:51.048]  and that the bureaucracy has hijacked things and is stealing elections, it's game over.
[00:03:51.048 --> 00:03:53.048]  This is an illegitimate government.
[00:03:53.048 --> 00:03:58.048]  And they're even weaponizing local jurisdictions and making them illegitimate.
[00:03:58.048 --> 00:04:05.048]  And there's a process the globalists talk about of discrediting nation-states while they use the nation-states to build globalism.
[00:04:05.048 --> 00:04:11.048]  The globalists admit Schwab gives endless speeches, Larry Fink of BlackRock gives endless speeches, we played them here,
[00:04:11.048 --> 00:04:16.048]  of how they're going to use the nation-states to carry out their goals and operations.
[00:04:16.048 --> 00:04:20.048]  There's going to be a time of great anger and upheaval and collapse.
[00:04:20.048 --> 00:04:27.048]  And then they ride in on their white horse as the savior to bring in the new system that's ten times worse.
[00:04:28.015 --> 00:04:32.015]  But they sit up there like we're not watching and listening to them like we're idiots.
[00:04:32.015 --> 00:04:35.015]  And they've always had disdain for the public, but the public can't figure that out.
[00:04:35.015 --> 00:04:39.015]  Well, guess what? The public's not as stupid as you thought we were.
[00:04:39.015 --> 00:04:42.015]  And so, now, you're unclothed.
[00:04:42.015 --> 00:04:44.015]  We see you. You're naked, Jack.
[00:04:44.015 --> 00:04:47.015]  And you're in a lot of trouble.
[00:04:47.015 --> 00:04:51.015]  So you better stop with the World War crap, stop with the poison shots,
[00:04:51.015 --> 00:04:56.015]  or I'm telling you, I'm telling you, you can see where this leads.
[00:04:57.015 --> 00:04:58.015]  I'm telling you.
[00:04:57.823 --> 00:05:05.703]  They decided to not perp-walking, not put him in handcuffs, not do a mugshot, because
[00:05:05.703 --> 00:05:07.222]  they knew that that would help Trump.
[00:05:07.222 --> 00:05:09.462]  Didn't they know this would backfire?
[00:05:09.462 --> 00:05:10.943]  We were waiting for the mugshot.
[00:05:10.943 --> 00:05:13.423]  We learned today they wouldn't have it, so we've made our own.
[00:05:13.423 --> 00:05:18.503]  And it says political prisoner with an image of President Trump.
[00:05:18.503 --> 00:05:20.943]  The shirt is being printed now in Texas.
[00:05:20.943 --> 00:05:23.543]  It'll be shipping out to you in one week.
[00:05:23.543 --> 00:05:29.743]  Political prisoner with Trump on the front there in a mugshot jail background.
[00:05:29.743 --> 00:05:30.743]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[00:05:30.743 --> 00:05:34.863]  It says InfoWars.com on the back of the shirt.
[00:05:34.863 --> 00:05:36.102]  We also have Alex Yoves for President.
[00:05:36.102 --> 00:05:37.503]  No, I'm not running for president.
[00:05:37.503 --> 00:05:41.143]  It's a really nice navy blue, high quality shirt, red, white, and blue, Alex Yoves for
[00:05:41.143 --> 00:05:42.663]  President 2024.
[00:05:42.663 --> 00:05:47.143]  It's a fun conversational piece and a limited edition shirt, great way to fund the operation.
[00:05:47.143 --> 00:05:55.143]  So get your Alex Yoves for President and Trump mugshot shirts at InfoWarsStore.com

[00:06:11.143 --> 00:06:15.143]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios,
[00:06:15.143 --> 00:06:19.143]  you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:19.143 --> 00:06:24.143]  Well, I'm taking a moment right now to be thankful to God and thankful to all of you
[00:06:24.143 --> 00:06:25.143]  and our great crew.
[00:06:25.143 --> 00:06:29.143]  And I'm not doing a victory lap here because we're in the middle of a war, but I said two
[00:06:29.143 --> 00:06:34.143]  months ago my primary mission of identifying the New World Order before it launched operations
[00:06:34.143 --> 00:06:38.143]  so people would know that they were the ones doing all these horrible things so they couldn't
[00:06:38.143 --> 00:06:39.143]  pose as saviors.
[00:06:39.143 --> 00:06:43.143]  That's been my primary mission for 29 years on air.
[00:06:43.143 --> 00:06:51.143]  Twenty nine years on air in a few days was to get people ready so that we'd have a resistance
[00:06:51.143 --> 00:06:54.143]  movement and an alternate to this New World Order plan.
[00:06:54.143 --> 00:06:58.143]  We have now reached that thanks to all of you.
[00:06:58.143 --> 00:07:00.143]  And so I salute you and I thank you.
[00:07:00.143 --> 00:07:03.143]  We're now not being caught flat footed.
[00:07:03.143 --> 00:07:09.143]  We are on our toes and we are in fighting stance and we are accelerating our resistance
[00:07:09.143 --> 00:07:11.143]  to victory.
[00:07:11.143 --> 00:07:12.143]  You can feel it.
[00:07:12.143 --> 00:07:13.143]  You can see it.
[00:07:13.143 --> 00:07:16.143]  Now, that doesn't mean the enemy isn't going to launch a nuclear war, turn off the power,
[00:07:16.143 --> 00:07:17.143]  God knows what.
[00:07:17.143 --> 00:07:19.143]  But we know they're behind it too.
[00:07:19.143 --> 00:07:20.143]  They're going to pay one way or another.
[00:07:20.143 --> 00:07:23.143]  They can back off or they can keep pushing it.
[00:07:23.143 --> 00:07:25.143]  But either way, they're going down.
[00:07:25.143 --> 00:07:27.143]  They can do it the easy way or they can do it the hard way.
[00:07:27.143 --> 00:07:29.143]  They will not suppress humanity more.
[00:07:29.143 --> 00:07:31.143]  Their New World Order plan is dead on arrival.
[00:07:31.143 --> 00:07:35.143]  So I want to play Robert Kennedy Jr. coming out and saying there's been a coup, CIA, New
[00:07:35.143 --> 00:07:36.143]  World Order.
[00:07:36.143 --> 00:07:37.143]  I want to play Ron Paul saying it.
[00:07:37.143 --> 00:07:39.143]  I want to play Trump saying it.
[00:07:39.143 --> 00:07:42.143]  I got a bunch of other Elon Musk world leaders saying it.
[00:07:42.143 --> 00:07:43.143]  It's out in the open.
[00:07:43.143 --> 00:07:45.143]  We have an illegitimate hijacked government.
[00:07:45.143 --> 00:07:47.143]  I'm going to put a compilation together.
[00:07:47.143 --> 00:07:49.143]  There's dozens of these that are new.
[00:07:49.143 --> 00:07:54.143]  But this is victory, identifying you have a coup, identifying it's a criminal bureaucracy
[00:07:54.143 --> 00:07:57.143]  and taking your government back instead of having a stupid civil war.
[00:07:57.143 --> 00:07:59.143]  Here is some of the clips.
[00:07:59.143 --> 00:08:01.143]  It's been a coup.
[00:08:01.143 --> 00:08:06.143]  We don't have any resemblance to a government that believes in a republic.
[00:08:06.143 --> 00:08:08.143]  We don't have honest money.
[00:08:08.143 --> 00:08:09.143]  We don't have integrity.
[00:08:09.143 --> 00:08:14.143]  We don't even have people in Washington that even pretends, you know, that you're supposed
[00:08:14.143 --> 00:08:15.143]  to tell the truth.
[00:08:15.143 --> 00:08:22.143]  You know, remember just recently there was a congressperson that won and he won by putting
[00:08:22.143 --> 00:08:24.143]  on his resume just a bunch of lies.
[00:08:24.143 --> 00:08:27.143]  And the other ones got hysterical.
[00:08:27.143 --> 00:08:30.143]  The other congressman was telling lies like that.
[00:08:30.143 --> 00:08:34.143]  And I got to thinking, well, how many of these people that were complaining about this guy
[00:08:34.143 --> 00:08:39.143]  telling lies, how many of them lied when they raised their hand up and swore to uphold
[00:08:39.143 --> 00:08:40.143]  the Constitution?
[00:08:40.143 --> 00:08:43.143]  Now, that's a lie that really has consequences.
[00:08:43.143 --> 00:08:48.143]  Actually, you could probably make fun and make a little joke because his jokes were everybody
[00:08:48.143 --> 00:08:50.143]  knew he was fibbing.
[00:08:50.143 --> 00:08:53.143]  But the real lies are being told.
[00:08:53.143 --> 00:08:55.143]  And that is our big problem.
[00:08:55.143 --> 00:08:58.143]  But I do believe there has been a coup and it's been taken over.
[00:08:58.143 --> 00:09:03.143]  And if I want to, if I can, I want to just put the date in my mind and anybody could
[00:09:03.143 --> 00:09:05.143]  pick probably any date in the last hundred year.
[00:09:05.143 --> 00:09:09.143]  But I picked I have picked November 22nd, 1963.
[00:09:09.143 --> 00:09:11.143]  What happened on that day?
[00:09:11.143 --> 00:09:13.143]  That was the day Kennedy was murdered by our government.
[00:09:13.143 --> 00:09:14.143]  Wow.
[00:09:14.143 --> 00:09:16.143]  You know, by the CIA.
[00:09:16.143 --> 00:09:22.143]  What I found was, you know, I saw this event to a one and raise your hand if you know what
[00:09:22.143 --> 00:09:24.143]  event to a one was.
[00:09:24.143 --> 00:09:32.143]  OK, for those of you don't know, event to a one was a pandemic simulation, a coronavirus
[00:09:32.143 --> 00:09:39.143]  pandemic simulation that took place in October of 2019.
[00:09:39.143 --> 00:09:43.143]  Nobody ever heard of coronavirus till January.
[00:09:43.143 --> 00:09:51.143]  So that's four or three months later in October, we now know that coronavirus was already circulating
[00:09:51.143 --> 00:09:52.143]  in September.
[00:09:52.143 --> 00:09:55.143]  So the month before in Wuhan.
[00:09:55.143 --> 00:09:57.143]  But nobody knew about it.
[00:09:58.143 --> 00:10:07.143]  And yet they had a coronavirus pandemic simulation in New York City hosted by Bill Gates and
[00:10:07.143 --> 00:10:15.143]  Avril Haines, the deputy former deputy director of the CIA, who did all of the Guantanamo
[00:10:15.143 --> 00:10:16.143]  Bay cover up.
[00:10:16.143 --> 00:10:18.143]  She is like the cover up queen.
[00:10:18.143 --> 00:10:20.143]  And they do a simulation.
[00:10:20.143 --> 00:10:22.143]  And who else is there?
[00:10:22.143 --> 00:10:30.143]  George Gayo, the head of Chinese CDC, who obviously knows the coronavirus is circulating.
[00:10:30.143 --> 00:10:33.143]  He is the world's coronavirus expert.
[00:10:33.143 --> 00:10:37.143]  He's also the head of the CDC in China.
[00:10:37.143 --> 00:10:43.143]  And then they had all of the social media platforms with air, the big insurance companies,
[00:10:43.143 --> 00:10:46.143]  Johnson and Johnson, the big pharma companies.
[00:10:46.143 --> 00:10:51.143]  And they meet for two days and they have four seminars.
[00:10:51.143 --> 00:10:53.143]  And each one is faking this.
[00:10:53.143 --> 00:10:58.143]  You know, coronavirus is spreading across the world and they simulate.
[00:10:58.143 --> 00:11:03.143]  They don't say, OK, we got vitamin D to everybody and we got to make sure everybody gets exercise
[00:11:03.143 --> 00:11:08.143]  and gets out of their house and gets healthy and, you know, builds their immune system.
[00:11:08.143 --> 00:11:10.143]  And, you know, there's none of that.
[00:11:10.143 --> 00:11:14.143]  And zinc and, you know, all the things we've got to figure out early treatments.
[00:11:14.143 --> 00:11:20.143]  We got to use the computer, the Internet to connect all 15 million doctors,
[00:11:20.143 --> 00:11:26.143]  frontline doctors around the world so that we know when they treat people what's working, what's not.
[00:11:26.143 --> 00:11:29.143]  And we're constantly upgrading the protocols.
[00:11:29.143 --> 00:11:31.143]  That's what they should have been doing.
[00:11:31.143 --> 00:11:32.143]  That's not what they're doing.
[00:11:32.143 --> 00:11:37.143]  They were they were working on ways to use the coronavirus pandemic as a pretense
[00:11:37.143 --> 00:11:41.143]  for clamping down totalitarian controls globally.
[00:11:42.143 --> 00:11:47.143]  And, you know, they talk about in some of these concentration camps and all of this stuff.
[00:11:47.143 --> 00:11:57.143]  But here that the last simulation on the fourth day, George Gale and Avril Haines from the CIA are talking.
[00:11:57.143 --> 00:12:05.143]  They have a soliloquy about how do we clamp down to stop people from saying this came from a lab leak.
[00:12:05.143 --> 00:12:09.143]  They're saying that this is October of 2019.
[00:12:09.143 --> 00:12:14.143]  And they say, well, we got to get the social media companies to set up for them and all this.
[00:12:14.143 --> 00:12:17.143]  You can go on YouTube and watch this tonight.
[00:12:17.143 --> 00:12:18.143]  It's called Event 201.
[00:12:18.143 --> 00:12:21.143]  And this is the fourth section of it.
[00:12:21.143 --> 00:12:27.143]  Oh, and people knew about that, you know, who are looking at this like me.
[00:12:27.143 --> 00:12:33.143]  And from almost the beginning, then I started doing a deep dive when I was writing the book.
[00:12:33.143 --> 00:12:35.143]  And I found out that was not a one off.
[00:12:35.143 --> 00:12:44.143]  And I describe in that book, I found about 20 of these that they had been doing since 2001.
[00:12:44.143 --> 00:12:47.143]  And they're all scripted by the CIA.
[00:12:47.143 --> 00:12:55.143]  And all of them include top level officials like James Woolsey, the deputy director of the CIA.
[00:12:55.143 --> 00:12:57.143]  Tarot tool.
[00:12:57.143 --> 00:13:00.143]  All of them have senior CIA officials.
[00:13:00.143 --> 00:13:06.143]  Many of them have famous people who kind of given the imprimatur of legitimacy to what they're doing.
[00:13:06.143 --> 00:13:12.143]  Like Madeleine Albright or Tom Daschle or, you know, Bill Gates and a lot of them.
[00:13:12.143 --> 00:13:16.143]  And Grove Brundtland from, you know, from the WHO.
[00:13:16.143 --> 00:13:18.143]  People who are respected.
[00:13:18.143 --> 00:13:22.143]  And they end up drilling.
[00:13:22.143 --> 00:13:27.143]  Each one of them is drilling the imposition of totalitarian controls.
[00:13:27.143 --> 00:13:35.143]  But collectively they have names like Dark Winter and Crimson Contagion and all these weird names.
[00:13:35.143 --> 00:13:39.143]  But collectively they're called Operation Lockstep.
[00:13:39.143 --> 00:13:44.143]  And they involved hundreds of thousands of people.
[00:13:44.143 --> 00:13:48.143]  Public officials from little towns all over America.
[00:13:48.143 --> 00:13:50.143]  Health officials from the state.
[00:13:50.143 --> 00:13:53.143]  Police, firefighters, hospital systems.
[00:13:53.143 --> 00:13:55.143]  Public utilities.
[00:13:55.143 --> 00:14:06.143]  And FBI, CIA, U.S. Marshals in Canada, the United States, all over Europe, Australia and China.
[00:14:06.143 --> 00:14:08.143]  They were all doing it together.
[00:14:08.143 --> 00:14:12.143]  Drilling, here's what we're going to do when a pandemic comes.
[00:14:12.143 --> 00:14:18.143]  And a lot of these people, you can see, are surprised about what they're doing.
[00:14:18.143 --> 00:14:24.143]  But they're probably looking around and saying, well, everybody else thinks this is okay.
[00:14:24.143 --> 00:14:27.143]  I guess this is what we do when the pandemic comes.
[00:14:27.143 --> 00:14:35.143]  So they got, they drilled people in doing something that was clearly contrary to their values.
[00:14:35.143 --> 00:14:42.143]  But it got them all teed up to do it and do it all at once and say this is what you do when there's a pandemic.
[00:14:42.143 --> 00:14:45.143]  The first thing you do is you end freedom of speech.
[00:14:45.143 --> 00:14:48.143]  And you start gutting the Constitution.
[00:14:48.143 --> 00:14:50.143]  What's happening is very simple.
[00:14:50.143 --> 00:14:56.143]  These are desperate to stop us because they know that we are the only ones who can stop them.
[00:14:56.143 --> 00:14:59.143]  And I will totally obliterate the deep state.
[00:14:59.143 --> 00:15:08.143]  I will fire the unelected bureaucrats who have weaponized our justice system.
[00:15:08.143 --> 00:15:13.143]  Look at what they've done to our justice system, what they have done to our justice system.
[00:15:13.143 --> 00:15:25.143]  I will direct the Department of Justice to go after Marxist prosecutors' offices to make them pay for their illegal race-based enforcement of the law.
[00:15:25.143 --> 00:15:28.143]  Many racists are there.
[00:15:28.143 --> 00:15:32.143]  And 2024 is the final battle. That's it.
[00:15:32.143 --> 00:15:39.143]  If you put me back in the White House, the reign of the corrupt Washington establishment will be over.
[00:15:40.143 --> 00:15:44.143]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are waking up to the fact that we live in a deep state coup.
[00:15:44.143 --> 00:15:46.143]  This is what victory is made of.
[00:15:46.143 --> 00:15:50.143]  Steve Bannon with a 35,000-foot view straight ahead.
[00:15:50.143 --> 00:15:52.143]  His strategies are key to victory.
[00:15:52.143 --> 00:15:53.143]  We'll be right back.
[00:16:00.143 --> 00:16:07.143]  If Alex Jones runs for president in the Republican Party, he has a chance of winning.
[00:16:10.143 --> 00:16:15.143]  If you just tuned in, you may be noticing I'm wearing an Alex Jones for president 2024 shirt.
[00:16:15.143 --> 00:16:18.143]  I am not seriously planning to run for president.
[00:16:18.143 --> 00:16:20.143]  This is an idea the crew had.
[00:16:20.143 --> 00:16:23.143]  I have a triggering shirt, kind of next-level Alex Jones is right.
[00:16:23.143 --> 00:16:28.143]  There's Infowars.com on the back, Alex Jones for president 2024 on the front.
[00:16:28.143 --> 00:16:29.143]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[00:16:29.143 --> 00:16:30.143]  It's made out of really nice fabric.
[00:16:30.143 --> 00:16:31.143]  It's high quality.
[00:16:31.143 --> 00:16:35.143]  And it is an exclusive shirt to Infowarsstore.com.
[00:16:35.143 --> 00:16:37.143]  And when the shirts are gone, they're gone.
[00:16:37.143 --> 00:16:42.143]  One run of Alex Jones for president 2024 shirts.
[00:16:42.143 --> 00:16:47.143]  And you'll have a historic memento, be able to spread the word, meet a lot of like-minded people.
[00:16:47.143 --> 00:16:49.143]  And you'll be able to keep us on the air.
[00:16:49.143 --> 00:16:51.143]  No way, no way.
[00:16:51.143 --> 00:16:52.143]  That's a bridge too far.
[00:16:52.143 --> 00:16:54.143]  No, it can't be.
[00:16:54.143 --> 00:16:56.143]  And I said on national television that he was going to win.
[00:16:56.143 --> 00:16:59.143]  At Infowarsstore.com.
[00:17:00.143 --> 00:17:04.143]  I talk a lot about the great successes Infowars has had.
[00:17:04.143 --> 00:17:06.143]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[00:17:06.143 --> 00:17:09.143]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[00:17:09.143 --> 00:17:14.143]  When we talk about the crew at Infowars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[00:17:14.143 --> 00:17:18.143]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[00:17:18.143 --> 00:17:23.143]  And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day,
[00:17:23.143 --> 00:17:25.143]  five, six, seven days a week.
[00:17:25.143 --> 00:17:27.143]  It's really just incredible.
[00:17:27.143 --> 00:17:31.143]  So for myself and the whole Infowars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[00:17:31.143 --> 00:17:37.143]  I want to encourage you now to realize that Infowars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[00:17:37.143 --> 00:17:38.143]  I know you spread the word.
[00:17:38.143 --> 00:17:39.143]  I know you pray for us.
[00:17:39.143 --> 00:17:40.143]  And that's wonderful.
[00:17:40.143 --> 00:17:41.143]  Keep doing it.
[00:17:41.143 --> 00:17:44.143]  But most viewers and listeners never go to Infowarsstore.com,
[00:17:44.143 --> 00:17:47.143]  and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life,
[00:17:47.143 --> 00:17:49.143]  all at the same time keep us on air.
[00:17:49.143 --> 00:17:53.143]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:17:53.143 --> 00:17:57.143]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to Infowarsstore.com,
[00:17:57.143 --> 00:17:58.143]  our funding problems will be over.
[00:17:58.143 --> 00:17:59.143]  Please take action now.
[00:17:59.143 --> 00:18:03.143]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones.
[00:18:07.143 --> 00:18:08.143]  I want you all to know something.
[00:18:08.143 --> 00:18:10.143]  Alex Jones was right.
[00:18:10.143 --> 00:18:14.143]  Alex is right about far more than he's wrong.
[00:18:14.143 --> 00:18:17.143]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[00:18:17.143 --> 00:18:21.143]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up, or rub it down.
[00:18:21.143 --> 00:18:23.143]  Alex Jones was right.
[00:18:23.143 --> 00:18:27.143]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[00:18:27.143 --> 00:18:31.143]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[00:18:31.143 --> 00:18:34.143]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[00:18:34.143 --> 00:18:35.143]  Years ago.
[00:18:35.143 --> 00:18:37.143]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax.
[00:18:37.143 --> 00:18:39.143]  Not for a second.
[00:18:39.143 --> 00:18:41.143]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[00:18:41.143 --> 00:18:44.143]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[00:18:44.143 --> 00:18:47.143]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[00:18:47.143 --> 00:18:49.143]  That's why the globalists hate me.
[00:18:49.143 --> 00:18:52.143]  It's because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[00:18:58.143 --> 00:19:04.143]  Every time I talk to you, you're either like on the border exposing the cartels and like coming under fire.
[00:19:04.143 --> 00:19:08.143]  Or you're on the streets of some American city hanging out with drug addicts and criminals.
[00:19:08.143 --> 00:19:11.143]  And now you've gone to ground zero of a massive chemical spill.
[00:19:11.143 --> 00:19:13.143]  Are you addicted to the danger, Savannah?
[00:19:13.143 --> 00:19:15.143]  Have you ever considered that for a second?
[00:19:15.143 --> 00:19:18.143]  No, I'm addicted to helping my fellow Americans.
[00:19:18.143 --> 00:19:20.143]  I'm addicted to spreading the truth.
[00:19:20.143 --> 00:19:22.143]  And again, you know, I have info words to thank for that.
[00:19:22.143 --> 00:19:26.143]  Looking back on the day, I was able to ask President Donald Trump two questions.
[00:19:26.143 --> 00:19:32.143]  I was so grateful because, you know, I truly was classically trained under Alex Jones and under the InfoWars team.
[00:19:32.143 --> 00:19:37.143]  And I really do credit that as to why I'm able to, you know, get these types of clips.
[00:19:37.143 --> 00:19:41.143]  Because Alex's whole mentality was, you know, go where the story is.
[00:19:41.143 --> 00:19:44.143]  Go where the mainstream media refuses to.
[00:19:44.143 --> 00:19:46.143]  So it's not that I'm addicted to the insanity.
[00:19:46.143 --> 00:19:49.143]  I'm just addicted to telling the truth and helping the American people.
[00:19:49.143 --> 00:19:54.143]  And I really do credit Alex for, you know, really instilling that within me early on in my career.
[00:19:56.143 --> 00:20:01.143]  Alex Jones
[00:20:01.143 --> 00:20:06.143]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:20:06.143 --> 00:20:09.143]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:15.060]  Because you can't starve us out and you can't make us run
[00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:19.060]  Those woods and mole boys raised on shotgun
[00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:23.060]  We say praise, we say man
[00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:27.060]  If you ain't into that, we don't give a damn
[00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:33.060]  We came from the West Virginia coal mines
[00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:37.060]  And the Rocky Mountains and the western skies
[00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:44.060]  And we can skin a buck, we can run a trot line
[00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:46.060]  And a country boy can survive
[00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:49.060]  And we can take our country back from the globalists
[00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:54.060]  Whether it's Bolsonaro in Brazil or Victor Orban in Eastern Europe
[00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:58.060]  Or whether it's Elon Musk now speaking out against the New World Order and World Government
[00:20:58.060 --> 00:21:01.060]  Or Robert F. Kennedy Jr. running as a Democrat
[00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:04.060]  Breaking down how there's been a coup over America
[00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:09.060]  Or President Trump or Ron Paul or Rand Paul or Steve Bannon
[00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:15.060]  We are identifying that illegal globalist corporate organizations
[00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:17.060]  Have seized control of our country
[00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:21.060]  And understanding that is the beginning of the end
[00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:23.060]  And the public's getting it
[00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:25.060]  And their biggest nightmare is now happening
[00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:28.060]  Just five years ago, the New York Times would run articles saying
[00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:30.060]  Globalism doesn't exist
[00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:31.060]  Now they tell you how great globalism is
[00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:33.060]  Now they want to take your freedoms
[00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:35.060]  Well, there are a lot of great broadcasts out there
[00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:37.060]  And I don't want to heap praise on people
[00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:40.060]  I do this to point people in the direction
[00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:42.060]  In case they haven't seen it or watched it
[00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:47.060]  That the best analysis, in-depth, multi-hours a day
[00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:49.060]  With the very best guest, period
[00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:53.060]  Hands down, is the war room with Steve Bannon
[00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:54.060]  Our war room's great as well
[00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:58.060]  Owen does a fabulous job on covering all the culture issues and strategies as well
[00:21:58.060 --> 00:22:01.060]  But Steve Bannon cuts right to it
[00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:04.060]  As he says, with signal, basically no noise
[00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:07.060]  And we've got Tucker Carlson who's awesome as well
[00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:09.060]  I'd put those two in the same category
[00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:11.060]  So it's a show everybody needs to watch
[00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:12.060]  Everybody needs to listen
[00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:14.060]  Everybody needs to share
[00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:15.060]  Because most of you are awake
[00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:16.060]  More awake than I am in many cases
[00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:18.060]  From your own life experiences
[00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:19.060]  But you have to understand
[00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:20.060]  You are not the tail
[00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:21.060]  You are the dog
[00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:23.060]  And the dog doesn't hunt if you don't take action
[00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:26.060]  And daily, aggressively, to people you know and don't know
[00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:28.060]  Share articles, share videos
[00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:32.060]  Ban.video and warroom.org
[00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:33.060]  So we've got him for 25 minutes
[00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:35.060]  We're going to skip this network break
[00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:37.060]  I'm going to try to give Steve Bannon the floor
[00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:38.060]  Just in general
[00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:39.060]  I said, what do you want to talk about?
[00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:41.060]  And he said, I want to talk about that Kennedy clip
[00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:44.060]  And how people are waking up to the fact we're an occupied nation
[00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:45.060]  The globalists are scared
[00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:48.060]  But we have to realize they've got some tricks up their sleeves
[00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:50.060]  So we'll talk about that
[00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:51.060]  Steve Bannon, great to have you
[00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:53.060]  And I'm going to try to just shut up and let you talk
[00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:55.060]  Like you let me do on your show
[00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:56.060]  Because you've got a lot of knowledge
[00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:57.060]  Thank you so much for folks
[00:22:57.060 --> 00:22:58.060]  We appreciate you
[00:22:58.060 --> 00:22:59.060]  Alex, thanks
[00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:00.060]  And thanks for the kind words
[00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:02.060]  Look, think about what's happened
[00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:04.060]  Just in the last couple of days
[00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:06.060]  You've got the, you know
[00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:08.060]  And Alex, you've always been portrayed
[00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:09.060]  By the mainstream media
[00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:10.060]  New York Times
[00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:11.060]  This conspiracy theory guy
[00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:12.060]  A wild man
[00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:13.060]  Tinfoil hat
[00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:15.060]  But if you take
[00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:17.060]  President Trump's responses
[00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:18.060]  To Tucker Carlson
[00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:19.060]  That great interview
[00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:21.060]  That was done at Mar-a-Lago
[00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:23.060]  Yesterday, played last night on Tucker's show
[00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:25.060]  And particularly President Trump
[00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:27.060]  Who are the greatest enemies
[00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:29.060]  Now that you've got the CCP
[00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:31.060]  You know, this Legion of Doom
[00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:33.060]  With the Mullahs in Iran
[00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:34.060]  With Erdogan in Turkey
[00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:37.060]  With the KGB and Putin in Russia
[00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:38.060]  And he says
[00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:39.060]  The administrative state
[00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:40.060]  The deep state
[00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:41.060]  It's people inside our government
[00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:42.060]  They're against us
[00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:44.060]  You couple that with Bobby Kennedy Jr.
[00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:46.060]  Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s speech
[00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:47.060]  At Hillsdale
[00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:49.060]  Which I think is historic
[00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:51.060]  In fact, we're going to break it down later tonight
[00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:53.060]  On our 6 o'clock show
[00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:56.060]  If you take those two
[00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:57.060]  That's what Alec Jones
[00:23:57.060 --> 00:23:59.060]  Has been talking about for a decade
[00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:00.060]  I mean, it's like
[00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:02.060]  They went back and looked at your show notes
[00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:03.060]  So I tell people
[00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:04.060]  And this is when you came on
[00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:05.060]  With the great book about
[00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:06.060]  The Great Reset
[00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:07.060]  Which was
[00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:08.060]  Had all the links to it
[00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:10.060]  Had all the research done to it
[00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:12.060]  That this has been very obvious
[00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:14.060]  To people that have studied this for a while
[00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:15.060]  And now it's come up
[00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:16.060]  That you have
[00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:17.060]  A guy who's been
[00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:18.060]  President of the United States
[00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:19.060]  And Commander-in-Chief
[00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:21.060]  Gave us four years of peace and prosperity
[00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:23.060]  He's leading all the polls in the primary
[00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:25.060]  He's leading head-to-head matchups with Biden
[00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:27.060]  In all likelihood, he'll be back
[00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:29.060]  Into the White House
[00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:31.060]  In January of 2025
[00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:33.060]  I had Matt Gaetz on the show today
[00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:35.060]  That said, hey, Trump realizes now
[00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:36.060]  Personnel's policy
[00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:38.060]  He made some mistakes in personnel
[00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:40.060]  He understands that
[00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:41.060]  They're going to come at him hard
[00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:43.060]  You combine what Trump said
[00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:45.060]  What Matt Gaetz said today
[00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:46.060]  On the Deep State
[00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:47.060]  Bobby Kennedy
[00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:49.060]  And everything that's happening
[00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:50.060]  With his intelligence leaks
[00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:51.060]  Right now
[00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:52.060]  Coming out of the Pentagon
[00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:54.060]  Or the Joint Chiefs of Staff
[00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:55.060]  I don't think you sound like
[00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:57.060]  A conspiracy theorist anymore
[00:24:57.060 --> 00:24:58.060]  I think you sound like
[00:24:58.060 --> 00:24:59.060]  Somebody that understood
[00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:00.060]  And could break down
[00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:01.060]  The system
[00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:03.060]  And see how the system works
[00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:04.060]  And right now
[00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:05.060]  People have to understand
[00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:06.060]  We're in a dogfight
[00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:07.060]  There's
[00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:08.060]  There's
[00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:09.060]  One side's going to win this
[00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:11.060]  And one side's going to lose
[00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:12.060]  And it is
[00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:14.060]  Not a foregone conclusion
[00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:15.060]  By a long shot
[00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:16.060]  That we're going to win
[00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:17.060]  But right now
[00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:18.060]  I feel
[00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:19.060]  The best I've ever felt
[00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:20.060]  In this fight
[00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:21.060]  Because we have
[00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:22.060]  Think about it
[00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:23.060]  Bobby Kennedy
[00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:24.060]  They came out
[00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:25.060]  Yesterday
[00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:26.060]  One of the
[00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:27.060]  The first poll that was taken
[00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:28.060]  With Kennedy in the race
[00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:29.060]  Has got Kennedy at 10%
[00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:30.060]  In the Democratic primary
[00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:31.060]  Biden at 7%
[00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:32.060]  Kennedy at 10%
[00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:33.060]  And remember
[00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:34.060]  There are no Democrats
[00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:35.060]  That support
[00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:36.060]  His
[00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:37.060]  His
[00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:38.060]  His take on big pharma
[00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:40.060]  And the pharmaceutical industrial complex
[00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:41.060]  The
[00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:43.060]  The left has totally been bought off
[00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:44.060]  Maybe some
[00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:45.060]  A small
[00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:46.060]  Amount of voters
[00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:47.060]  But MSNBC
[00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:48.060]  New York Times
[00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:49.060]  CNN
[00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:50.060]  Are owned by Pfizer
[00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:51.060]  Owned by big pharma
[00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:52.060]  So
[00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:53.060]  I think it's amazing
[00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:54.060]  What's happened
[00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:55.060]  Over the last couple of days
[00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:56.060]  And I would just tell people
[00:25:56.060 --> 00:25:57.060]  Hey
[00:25:57.060 --> 00:25:58.060]  We're in the fight right now
[00:25:58.060 --> 00:25:59.060]  You got a global conflict
[00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:00.060]  You got a global financial conflict
[00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:01.060]  But
[00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:02.060]  It's all
[00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:03.060]  The populist nationalist
[00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:04.060]  Versus the globalist
[00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:05.060]  The globalist elite
[00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:06.060]  And it's game on
[00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:07.060]  Well that's why
[00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:08.060]  I got so mad
[00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:09.060]  At the few people
[00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:10.060]  I don't want to just start fights
[00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:11.060]  But
[00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:12.060]  You were a top advisor to Trump
[00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:13.060]  You were there
[00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:14.060]  You knew you were surrounded
[00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:15.060]  He was surrounded
[00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:16.060]  You knew he was literally
[00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:18.060]  In the arena
[00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:19.060]  And then they're like
[00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:20.060]  No
[00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:21.060]  The government's all captured
[00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:22.060]  By good people
[00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:23.060]  We're winning
[00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:24.060]  We're invincible
[00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:25.060]  No
[00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:26.060]  You gotta be honest with people
[00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:27.060]  This is like a Muhammad Ali
[00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:28.060]  You know
[00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:29.060]  Match
[00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:30.060]  With George Foreman
[00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:31.060]  This is battling
[00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:32.060]  Right into the 12th round
[00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:33.060]  Folks
[00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:34.060]  We have a chance to win
[00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:35.060]  We have an edge
[00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:37.060]  And as soon as people realize
[00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:38.060]  That we're in a real war
[00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:39.060]  We'll have way more than an edge
[00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:40.060]  But this
[00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:41.060]  Lackadaisical
[00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:42.060]  Attitude
[00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:43.060]  That everything's gonna be fine
[00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:44.060]  Is delusional
[00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:45.060]  And is extremely dangerous
[00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:47.060]  And that's why you
[00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:48.060]  Hammer the point
[00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:49.060]  And maybe you can speak to that
[00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:50.060]  That people need to get
[00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:51.060]  Their game face on
[00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:52.060]  And realize
[00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:53.060]  This is historic
[00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:54.060]  This is the future
[00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:55.060]  And the tyranny they're bringing in
[00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:56.060]  With the central bank
[00:26:56.060 --> 00:26:57.060]  Digital currencies
[00:26:57.060 --> 00:26:58.060]  And the new world order
[00:26:58.060 --> 00:26:59.060]  And the social credit score
[00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:00.060]  Will make us like communist China
[00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:01.060]  This is not a game
[00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:02.060]  They are
[00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:03.060]  Closing the gate on us
[00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:04.060]  They are locking our asses up
[00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:05.060]  Yeah
[00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:06.060]  I don't think
[00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:07.060]  The one thing
[00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:08.060]  About that
[00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:09.060]  Is that I've never
[00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:10.060]  Agreed with
[00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:11.060]  Although I think
[00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:12.060]  There's some very interesting
[00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:13.060]  Elements that come out
[00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:14.060]  That you see as true over time
[00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:15.060]  But the one thing
[00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:16.060]  I've never gotten
[00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:17.060]  Is this whole thing
[00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:18.060]  About these white hats
[00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:19.060]  And these white hats
[00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:20.060]  Versus black hats
[00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:21.060]  And the white hats
[00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:22.060]  Hey, that's all a fantasy
[00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:23.060]  That's just
[00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:24.060]  I can tell you
[00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:25.060]  From being on the inside
[00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:27.060]  And being his right-hand man
[00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:28.060]  Or one of his right-hand men
[00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:29.060]  For the first
[00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:30.060]  At least first year
[00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:31.060]  Or first nine months
[00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:32.060]  In fighting fights
[00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:33.060]  In the National Security Council
[00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:34.060]  And others
[00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:35.060]  This
[00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:36.060]  The government
[00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:37.060]  Is very much
[00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:38.060]  And they've done this
[00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:39.060]  Remember
[00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:40.060]  This whole thing
[00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:41.060]  Of an administrative state
[00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:42.060]  What the progressive left
[00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:43.060]  Thought through
[00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:44.060]  And they wanted to be
[00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:45.060]  Impervious to elections
[00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:46.060]  So they basically
[00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:47.060]  Created a fourth branch
[00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:48.060]  Of government
[00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:49.060]  That's totally
[00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:50.060]  Outside the Constitution
[00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:51.060]  That fourth branch
[00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:52.060]  Of government
[00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:53.060]  Not just the alphabet
[00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:54.060]  Agencies
[00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:55.060]  But also weaponizing
[00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:56.060]  The cabinet positions
[00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:57.060]  To form an administrative
[00:27:57.060 --> 00:27:58.060]  State that has
[00:27:58.060 --> 00:27:59.060]  Their own courts
[00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:00.060]  Has its own rules
[00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:01.060]  And regulations
[00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:02.060]  Is able to
[00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:03.060]  Promulgate those rules
[00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:04.060]  And regulations
[00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:05.060]  And has enforcement
[00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:06.060]  As you've been
[00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:07.060]  The absolute tip
[00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:08.060]  Of the spear
[00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:09.060]  Of showing how
[00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:10.060]  IRS
[00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:11.060]  And ATF
[00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:12.060]  And all these different
[00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:13.060]  Up-armored
[00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:14.060]  You know
[00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:15.060]  They have
[00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:16.060]  EPA
[00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:17.060]  They have
[00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:18.060]  Up-armored
[00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:19.060]  Enforcement apparatus
[00:28:19.060 --> 00:28:20.060]  That's the administrative state
[00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:21.060]  The deep
[00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:22.060]  Rogue element
[00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:23.060]  Of that
[00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:24.060]  Is the deep state
[00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:25.060]  That is the combination
[00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:26.060]  Of the intelligence
[00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:27.060]  Agencies
[00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:28.060]  And now the law
[00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:29.060]  Enforcement
[00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:30.060]  And national security
[00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:31.060]  Into one kind
[00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:32.060]  Of core group
[00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:33.060]  That has its own
[00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:34.060]  Mentality
[00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:35.060]  That's impervious
[00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:36.060]  To what
[00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:37.060]  You know
[00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:38.060]  Democratically elected
[00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:39.060]  Presidents
[00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:40.060]  That
[00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:41.060]  You know
[00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:42.060]  Have a republican
[00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:43.060]  Form of government
[00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:44.060]  They're totally against
[00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:45.060]  They have their own
[00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:46.060]  Mindset
[00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:47.060]  You can see this
[00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:48.060]  Quite frankly
[00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:49.060]  In these pentagon
[00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:50.060]  Leaks right now
[00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:51.060]  Now there's
[00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:52.060]  Matt Cates
[00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:53.060]  The theory today
[00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:54.060]  He thinks that may
[00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:55.060]  Be the deep state
[00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:56.060]  Leaking on purpose
[00:28:56.060 --> 00:28:57.060]  Okay to try to get
[00:28:57.060 --> 00:28:58.060]  Europe up there
[00:28:58.060 --> 00:28:59.060]  All I would say
[00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:00.060]  If that's the case
[00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:01.060]  The one thing
[00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:02.060]  I can tell you
[00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:03.060]  From looking at this
[00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:04.060]  Is that
[00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:05.060]  The triumphalist
[00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:06.060]  Narrative
[00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:07.060]  About Ukraine
[00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:08.060]  Is absolutely
[00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:09.060]  Dead wrong
[00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:10.060]  Because there
[00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:11.060]  Is a lot of information
[00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:12.060]  Going back and forth
[00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:13.060]  About the
[00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:14.060]  Folly
[00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:15.060]  About this
[00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:16.060]  Spring offensive
[00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:17.060]  By Zelensky
[00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:18.060]  What a
[00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:19.060]  Folly it is
[00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:20.060]  It also has the fact
[00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:21.060]  That there's special
[00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:22.060]  Operators
[00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:23.060]  I mean
[00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:24.060]  Posobiec broke this
[00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:25.060]  On the show
[00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:26.060]  Monday morning
[00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:27.060]  He went through it
[00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:28.060]  Overnight
[00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:29.060]  That there's all
[00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:30.060]  Types of special
[00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:31.060]  Operators
[00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:32.060]  Including 14
[00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:33.060]  Americans
[00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:34.060]  I think there's a
[00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:35.060]  Couple hundred
[00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:36.060]  Special forces
[00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:37.060]  From NATO
[00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:38.060]  Already working
[00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:39.060]  Inside
[00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:40.060]  But before
[00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:41.060]  February
[00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:42.060]  Of last year
[00:29:42.060 --> 00:29:43.060]  I said
[00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:44.060]  The US is already
[00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:45.060]  There
[00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:46.060]  They're gearing up
[00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:47.060]  For war
[00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:48.060]  They're going to
[00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:49.060]  Russia's going to
[00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:50.060]  Invade in late
[00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:51.060]  February
[00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:52.060]  I don't have
[00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:53.060]  Like a lot
[00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:54.060]  Of incredible
[00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:55.060]  Context
[00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:56.060]  But I have a lot
[00:29:56.060 --> 00:29:57.060]  Of context
[00:29:57.060 --> 00:29:58.060]  That I guess
[00:29:58.060 --> 00:29:59.060]  Are amazing
[00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:00.060]  And I know
[00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:01.060]  People personally
[00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:02.060]  Whose sons
[00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:03.060]  And whose brothers
[00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:04.060]  Are over there
[00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:05.060]  In army special
[00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:06.060]  Operations
[00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:07.060]  And people are
[00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:08.060]  Being killed
[00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:09.060]  There are
[00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:10.060]  Thousands
[00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:11.060]  Of US special
[00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:12.060]  Forces
[00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:13.060]  That have been
[00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:14.060]  Sheep-dipped
[00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:15.060]  Into neighboring
[00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:16.060]  Countries
[00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:17.060]  Militaries
[00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:18.060]  Or into
[00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:19.060]  Other
[00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:20.060]  Operational
[00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:21.060]  Groups
[00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:22.060]  Under other
[00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:23.060]  Names that are
[00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:24.060]  There
[00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:25.060]  A lot of
[00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:26.060]  Americans
[00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:27.060]  Are getting
[00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:28.060]  Killed
[00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:29.060]  They have a
[00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:30.060]  Coalition of
[00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:31.060]  More than I'd
[00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:32.060]  Say 50
[00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:33.060]  Countries
[00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:34.060]  That have been
[00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:35.060]  There
[00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:36.060]  Fighting
[00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:37.060]  So this
[00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:38.060]  Is what
[00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:39.060]  They call
[00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:40.060]  The Russians
[00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:41.060]  Were already
[00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:42.060]  Battling US
[00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:43.060]  Forces and
[00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:44.060]  Losing 14
[00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:45.060]  Months ago
[00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:46.060]  That's why
[00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:47.060]  Putin did what
[00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:48.060]  He did
[00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:49.060]  And I'm not
[00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:50.060]  Defending what
[00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:51.060]  Putin did
[00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:52.060]  But the Russians
[00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:53.060]  Had to double
[00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:54.060]  Down as they
[00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:55.060]  Were getting
[00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:56.060]  Their ass
[00:30:56.060 --> 00:30:57.060]  Kicked
[00:30:57.060 --> 00:30:58.060]  Because we
[00:30:58.060 --> 00:30:59.060]  Are at war
[00:30:59.060 --> 00:31:00.060]  With Russia
[00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:01.060]  We have to
[00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:02.060]  By the way
[00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:03.060]  When you get
[00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:04.060]  That compilation
[00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:05.060]  We'd love to
[00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:06.060]  Get you back
[00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:07.060]  Because I
[00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:08.060]  Believe this
[00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:09.060]  Can be used
[00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:10.060]  In an impeachment
[00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:11.060]  Effort
[00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:12.060]  This is
[00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:13.060]  Completely
[00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:14.060]  Unacceptable
[00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:15.060]  This is
[00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:16.060]  Once again
[00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:17.060]  The administrative
[00:31:17.060 --> 00:31:18.060]  And deep
[00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:19.060]  State
[00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:20.060]  That wants
[00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:21.060]  To forever
[00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:22.060]  Wars
[00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:23.060]  And now
[00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:24.060]  They know
[00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:25.060]  Republicans
[00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:26.060]  In the house
[00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:27.060]  Are sitting
[00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:28.060]  There
[00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:29.060]  Specifically
[00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:30.060]  In the budget
[00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:31.060]  And saying
[00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:32.060]  We don't
[00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:33.060]  Want this
[00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:34.060]  We want
[00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:35.060]  Troops
[00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:36.060]  They're trying
[00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:37.060]  To enforce
[00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:38.060]  That
[00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:39.060]  Explain that
[00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:40.060]  To people
[00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:41.060]  Well you've got
[00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:42.060]  The use of
[00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:43.060]  Military force
[00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:44.060]  Remember
[00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:45.060]  The president
[00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:46.060]  Doesn't just
[00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:47.060]  Have the power
[00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:48.060]  They have
[00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:49.060]  This war
[00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:50.060]  Powers act
[00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:51.060]  But even

[00:47:48.540 --> 00:47:49.540]  Rats
[00:47:49.540 --> 00:47:50.540]  And
[00:47:50.540 --> 00:47:51.540]  Black
[00:47:51.540 --> 00:47:52.540]  Rats
[00:47:52.540 --> 00:47:53.540]  And
[00:47:53.540 --> 00:47:54.540]  Black
[00:47:54.540 --> 00:47:55.540]  Rats
[00:47:55.540 --> 00:47:56.540]  And
[00:47:56.540 --> 00:47:57.540]  Black
[00:47:57.350 --> 00:48:04.350]  90% love on the streets, but still 10% hate was hard to deal with.
[00:48:04.350 --> 00:48:06.350]  I mean, but I still went out everywhere and just said, screw it.
[00:48:06.350 --> 00:48:10.350]  Every time I went to a grocery store, a restaurant, I was probably going to have a problem.
[00:48:10.350 --> 00:48:13.350]  And now...
[00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:22.080]  Eight months at least, not one person, and all I've had is constant former Liberals come
[00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:26.319]  and say, you're right, I was wrong, I apologize, and what they did to you is wrong.
[00:48:26.319 --> 00:48:27.560]  And again, I'm just a bellwether.
[00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:34.920]  I'm just somebody out front, so I'm telling you, as a Vanguard, hey, folks, we are kicking
[00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:36.880]  New World Order ass.
[00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:42.400]  And they really overplayed their hand with the poison shots and suppressing the therapeutics.
[00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:44.160]  They really screwed up.
[00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:47.440]  They screwed up bad, but I want to be completely honest with you.
[00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:49.520]  I got to repeat this.
[00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:51.839]  We are not out of the woods, people, okay?
[00:48:51.839 --> 00:48:59.360]  The enemy has doubled down, and they are lying at levels I've never seen before.
[00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:07.560]  They are doing things that are so over the top, and I'm not even going to give any coverage
[00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:11.920]  to me personally, that it actually makes you feel sorry for them.
[00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:13.200]  I don't know how to explain that.
[00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:15.000]  It's like, man, you are just scum.
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:17.279]  I mean, you are...
[00:49:17.279 --> 00:49:23.759]  They create lies where none of it's true, and they're so complex and so big and so ridiculous,
[00:49:23.759 --> 00:49:24.920]  you're like, did I do that?
[00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:32.320]  And you're like, no, I was never even there.
[00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:34.880]  I don't even, what the hell are they talking about?
[00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:39.160]  But it's like if the cop showed up at your door and said, we know you killed five kids
[00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:40.160]  and they're buried in the backyard.
[00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:41.160]  You'd still kind of feel weird.
[00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:44.920]  Like, did I know how they were killed kids?
[00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:45.920]  It's crazy.
[00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:49.120]  And people, you know, you think, you know, they lie.
[00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:50.440]  Let me tell you something.
[00:49:50.440 --> 00:49:55.280]  I've been doing this 29 years until the last five or six, seven or eight with what's happened
[00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:56.760]  with Trump.
[00:49:56.760 --> 00:49:57.760]  It was a cakewalk.
[00:49:57.760 --> 00:49:59.160]  It was nothing.
[00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:01.800]  This has been, and I really mean this.
[00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:08.720]  I've not enjoyed the pain I've been through, but I have, I am so educated now with how
[00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:12.560]  the world works personally, dealing with these people that.
[00:50:13.810 --> 00:50:21.810]  It's invaluable. I mean, I have really been around the block a few times.
[00:50:21.810 --> 00:50:25.810]  And I guess that's part of being older. Everybody has experiences. You learn things as you go.
[00:50:25.810 --> 00:50:29.810]  But man, the stuff I've seen, people wouldn't even believe.
[00:50:29.810 --> 00:50:37.810]  I mean, the things they have done to me, and I'm not a victim.
[00:50:37.810 --> 00:50:40.810]  I appreciate God allowing this to happen and taking me through it.
[00:50:40.810 --> 00:50:42.810]  I ask God, please, I want to keep winning.
[00:50:42.810 --> 00:50:45.810]  The one thing is, I don't want to be famous. I don't want to be powerful.
[00:50:45.810 --> 00:50:47.810]  I don't want any of that crap. I want to win.
[00:50:47.810 --> 00:50:50.810]  But I do not like losing to these people.
[00:50:50.810 --> 00:50:56.810]  So, I mean, I just ask God to keep me in the game and to make me strong.
[00:50:56.810 --> 00:51:00.810]  And I think you should ask God that, too, because that's what's happened.
[00:51:00.810 --> 00:51:02.810]  And I know what God wants.
[00:51:02.810 --> 00:51:08.810]  Von Bismarck, the famous German statesman, said that God loves children, drunks,
[00:51:08.810 --> 00:51:10.810]  and the United States of America.
[00:51:10.810 --> 00:51:13.810]  And I've experienced that in my life. It's true.
[00:51:13.810 --> 00:51:16.810]  And God hates cowards.
[00:51:16.810 --> 00:51:21.810]  So if you study the Bible and you study history and who God blessed,
[00:51:21.810 --> 00:51:27.810]  King David was a good person of good heart but was also very easy to get angry
[00:51:27.810 --> 00:51:30.810]  and also very lustful.
[00:51:30.810 --> 00:51:34.810]  And he sent his best friend off to be killed because his wife was so hot
[00:51:35.810 --> 00:51:38.810]  that he sent him on a suicide mission.
[00:51:38.810 --> 00:51:42.810]  And he got killed, his best friend, and he had sex with his wife.
[00:51:42.810 --> 00:51:47.810]  But he truly repented and was just sick with it for months.
[00:51:47.810 --> 00:51:51.810]  And God said, I forgive you. You're a man after my own heart.
[00:51:51.810 --> 00:51:55.810]  So to me, that's what you've got to understand about God.
[00:51:55.810 --> 00:51:57.810]  God doesn't like cowards.
[00:51:58.200 --> 00:52:01.200]  And King David was not a coward.
[00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:06.400]  And he was a man of action.
[00:52:06.180 --> 00:52:13.180]  Now his son's probably in hell, Solomon. But the point is, is that
[00:52:15.880 --> 00:52:20.880]  You have to understand the number one thing is being a coward.
[00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:24.880]  If you are a damn coward, God does not like you.
[00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:28.880]  And people need to stop being cowards!
[00:52:29.300 --> 00:52:40.500]  These globalists are a bunch of cowards.
[00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:49.340]  If they weren't demonically controlled under demonic agency, they would love the power
[00:52:49.340 --> 00:52:53.460]  of America and the strength and the will and the invention.
[00:52:53.460 --> 00:52:57.540]  Instead, they freaking hate it and that's why they've run us into the ground and we've let
[00:52:57.540 --> 00:52:59.700]  them do it.
[00:52:59.700 --> 00:53:04.860]  They hate you having a nice house and a nice husband or wife and great children.
[00:53:04.860 --> 00:53:06.540]  They hate you having a great vacation.
[00:53:06.540 --> 00:53:07.780]  They hate you loving God.
[00:53:07.780 --> 00:53:09.140]  They hate you going to church.
[00:53:09.140 --> 00:53:16.500]  They hate you being satisfied because they're not satisfied and they can take one look at
[00:53:16.500 --> 00:53:25.100]  us and tell, that guy's satisfied, I'm so satisfied, I enjoy my life and sunsets in
[00:53:25.100 --> 00:53:32.340]  food and my wife and my children and my friends, man, I'm so happy, I'm so confident, I'm so
[00:53:32.340 --> 00:53:37.660]  fulfilled because I have Jesus Christ, ladies and gentlemen, and I know I'm a fallen sinner
[00:53:37.660 --> 00:53:41.140]  but I know I've been to the top of the mountain and I see where this goes and I want to go
[00:53:41.140 --> 00:53:46.700]  with that and God made me this way and I understand God.
[00:53:47.860 --> 00:53:56.700]  And I was never a Satanist and I was never fully controlled by evil, but there was a time when I was a teenager that I
[00:53:57.100 --> 00:54:06.940]  dabbled on the edges of what was really serious evil. I was completely unhappy during that
[00:54:06.940 --> 00:54:14.259]  period of time. And man, knowing God and standing up for what's right just gets better and better
[00:54:14.259 --> 00:54:18.620]  and better. And I've never been a sadomasochist. I don't like pain. But now when they're doing
[00:54:18.620 --> 00:54:26.299]  bad things to me, I realize doors are being opened to victory. Everything they do to me
[00:54:26.299 --> 00:54:32.060]  goes back many fold in better things. So now I've learned, man, this is really gonna hurt.
[00:54:32.060 --> 00:54:39.020]  This is gonna be hard. And now I almost actually enjoy it. Actually, well, this is really horrible.
[00:54:39.020 --> 00:54:44.380]  But okay, God, it's your plan. I still trust you. And I know you're gonna take me through
[00:54:44.380 --> 00:54:50.180]  this. And then it's like I go up a level and the discernment just gets so fantastic that
[00:54:50.180 --> 00:54:55.060]  you're just like, Oh, my gosh, the Satanists can't see this. They don't even they don't
[00:54:55.140 --> 00:54:57.700]  understand this, but they know we've got it.
[00:54:57.700 --> 00:55:05.259]  Whoa, we got more coming up on a ton of news. We'll hit it all. But I want to just say something
[00:55:05.259 --> 00:55:11.980]  here. I need to be funded. And I met with accountants this morning. And they said to me,
[00:55:11.980 --> 00:55:18.020]  the way it works in the bankruptcy, because I was totally broke, is the court allowed me to
[00:55:18.020 --> 00:55:23.100]  sell a couple products that I get a percentage of because I had court also ruled I got to pay.
[00:55:23.100 --> 00:55:29.220]  First, it was 40 now half of all the legal bills. So I'm completely out of money. And they came in,
[00:55:29.220 --> 00:55:32.740]  they said, you've not been plugging in for platinum. It's one of your best sellers.
[00:55:32.740 --> 00:55:39.180]  It's testosterone beach, the testosterone boost, the name testosterone boost, testosterone boost,
[00:55:39.180 --> 00:55:46.020]  pain MD, the super HD stuff sold out, we're getting more in soon. And I said, Wow, you're
[00:55:46.020 --> 00:55:51.339]  right. I've been so focused on getting money to free speech systems that I don't that I'm out
[00:55:51.339 --> 00:55:56.620]  of money. So it's a great product, and you need it. And it's close to selling out. And it's
[00:55:56.620 --> 00:56:02.220]  testosterone boost and pain MD. They're clones of a pharmaceutical company that also has a big
[00:56:02.220 --> 00:56:06.940]  vitamin supplement line, one of the top ones in the country. They're clones of their best sellers.
[00:56:06.940 --> 00:56:11.500]  I went to them a year ago. And I said, What are your best sellers? I said, these three products,
[00:56:11.500 --> 00:56:16.340]  I would look to reviews. Amazing. Can I probably label it? Yes. They don't let other people do
[00:56:16.340 --> 00:56:23.140]  that. They let me, I'm very blessed. And so it's an infomercial.com. And it funds the operation
[00:56:23.140 --> 00:56:28.740]  show. That shows how my brain works. I'm like, well, I got a percentage of that free speech is
[00:56:28.740 --> 00:56:34.660]  barely paying the bills. I better just but then run my bank account down to almost nothing. So
[00:56:34.660 --> 00:56:39.299]  it's very liberating. I like that. Because they think they can take money away from here. This
[00:56:39.299 --> 00:56:45.460]  means nothing to me, except fuel. I worship gasoline. I put my car No, it gets me somewhere.
[00:56:46.020 --> 00:56:49.859]  And these are great products that will empower your life to amazing things pain MD

[00:57:37.940 --> 00:57:42.660]  Marching forward with the cross of Jesus our number two straight ahead.
[00:57:48.430 --> 00:57:55.430]  They decided to not perp walking, not put him in handcuffs, not do a mugshot because they knew that that would help Trump.
[00:57:55.430 --> 00:58:00.430]  Didn't they know this would backfire? We were waiting for the mugshot. We learned today they wouldn't have it.
[00:58:00.430 --> 00:58:06.430]  So we've made our own. And it says political prisoner with an image of President Trump.
[00:58:06.430 --> 00:58:11.430]  The shirt is being printed now in Texas. It'll be shipping out to you in one week.
[00:58:11.430 --> 00:58:18.430]  Political prisoner with Trump on the front there in a mugshot jail background.
[00:58:18.430 --> 00:58:23.430]  It's a fundraiser shirt. It says InfoWars.com on the back of the shirt.
[00:58:23.430 --> 00:58:26.430]  We also have Alex Jones for president. No, I'm not running for president.
[00:58:26.430 --> 00:58:29.430]  It's a really nice navy blue, high quality shirt, red, white and blue.
[00:58:29.430 --> 00:58:34.430]  Alex Jones for president 24. It's a fun conversational piece and a limited edition shirt.

[00:58:49.430 --> 00:58:57.430]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones.
[00:58:57.430 --> 00:59:00.430]  I want you all to know something. Alex Jones was right.
[00:59:01.430 --> 00:59:04.430]  Alex is right about far more than he's wrong.
[00:59:04.430 --> 00:59:07.430]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[00:59:07.430 --> 00:59:13.430]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down. Alex Jones was right.
[00:59:13.430 --> 00:59:17.430]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[00:59:17.430 --> 00:59:21.430]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[00:59:21.430 --> 00:59:25.430]  Alex Jones called this years ago. Years ago.
[00:59:25.430 --> 00:59:28.430]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax. Not for a second.
[00:59:29.430 --> 00:59:34.430]  You are one of the great thinkers of this. You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[00:59:34.430 --> 00:59:37.430]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[00:59:37.430 --> 00:59:42.430]  That's why the globalists hate me is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[00:59:48.240 --> 00:59:58.240]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:59:58.240 --> 01:00:06.240]  Mr. President, thank you for having us.
[01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:07.240]  Thank you.
[01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:09.240]  Last week you were in New York for this arraignment.
[01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:10.240]  The world watched it.
[01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:12.240]  You've not given an interview since.
[01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:14.240]  You were there, I think, 57 minutes.
[01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:16.240]  Tell us from your perspective what that was like.
[01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:20.240]  Well, it was a horrible thing because I did nothing wrong.
[01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:21.240]  Absolutely nothing wrong.
[01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:27.240]  You look at even the pundits and the legal analysis, Greg Jarrett, all of these really talented people.
[01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:29.240]  They're saying he didn't do anything wrong.
[01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:30.240]  So that's number one.
[01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:33.240]  Number two, they were incredible.
[01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:40.240]  When I went to the courthouse, which is also a prison in a sense, they signed me in.
[01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:42.240]  And I'll tell you, people were crying.
[01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:48.240]  People that work there, professionally work there, that have no problems putting in murderers and they see everybody.
[01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:50.240]  It's tough, tough place.
[01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:52.240]  And they were crying.
[01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:53.240]  They were actually crying.
[01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:55.240]  They said, I'm sorry.
[01:00:55.240 --> 01:00:58.240]  They'd say, 2024, sir, 2024.
[01:00:58.240 --> 01:01:00.240]  And tears are pouring down their eyes.
[01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:02.240]  I've never seen anything like that.
[01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:04.240]  Those people are phenomenal.
[01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:06.240]  Those are your police.
[01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:09.240]  Those are the people that work at the courthouse.
[01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:11.240]  They're unbelievable people.
[01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:16.240]  Many of them were in tears or close to it.
[01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:18.240]  Many apologists were sorry, sir.
[01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:19.240]  We're sorry.
[01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:21.240]  They had to have me do certain things.
[01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:25.240]  They said, sir, I can't believe I have to ask you.
[01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:27.240]  I can't even believe that I have to ask you to do it.
[01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:28.240]  You could see.
[01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:32.240]  So in one sense, it was beautiful because they get it.
[01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:34.240]  And in another sense, you know, it's nasty.
[01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:35.240]  I went to the Wharton School of Finance.
[01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:37.240]  They didn't teach me about that.
[01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:41.240]  They didn't know about the arraignment part?
[01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:43.240]  We didn't have a class on arraignment.
[01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:47.240]  And it was a sad day in many ways.
[01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:49.240]  And in many ways, it was a beautiful day
[01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:51.240]  because the people understand.
[01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:53.240]  I didn't know this was happening.
[01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:56.240]  But the poll numbers have gone through the roof.
[01:01:56.240 --> 01:01:57.240]  The people get it.
[01:01:57.240 --> 01:01:59.240]  And the other ones are hoaxes also.
[01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:00.240]  You know, the box hoax.
[01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:01.240]  Look at Biden.
[01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:03.240]  He's got 1,850 boxes.
[01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:05.240]  And that's a hoax.
[01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:07.240]  The one in Atlanta where I had a perfect phone call.
[01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:09.240]  This is all weaponization.
[01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:12.240]  They're weaponizing our justice system, Tucker.
[01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:15.240]  And they think if they go and give you a subpoena,
[01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:18.240]  you know, I guess I'm very well known and people understand it
[01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:20.240]  and they get it and maybe I have a bigger platform
[01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:22.240]  so I can explain it.
[01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:24.240]  But if you're somebody, a Republican, let's say,
[01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:27.240]  running for office and you get a subpoena,
[01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:29.240]  you might as well resign because you're not going to be able
[01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:30.240]  to survive it.
[01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:32.240]  And the voters aren't going to handle it.
[01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:34.240]  The voters aren't going to take it.
[01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:36.240]  What they're doing is weaponizing the system
[01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:38.240]  and there's never been anything like it.
[01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:40.240]  And it's all disinformation.
[01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:43.240]  You see, the other day, Afghanistan,
[01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:45.240]  one of the worst things I've ever seen,
[01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:49.240]  I think the most embarrassing moment that this country's ever had,
[01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:50.240]  frankly, the way we got out.
[01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:51.240]  Not the getting out.
[01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:52.240]  We had to get out.
[01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:54.240]  It was ridiculous to be there.
[01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:57.240]  And I had that so good, so tight, so tough.
[01:02:57.240 --> 01:02:59.240]  I spoke to the leader, Abdul.
[01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:01.240]  I said, Abdul, if you do anything,
[01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:03.240]  you're going to get hit really hard.
[01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:06.240]  Literally, he said, but sir, why?
[01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:07.240]  Why?
[01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:10.240]  He goes, why oh why do you send me a picture of my house?
[01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:13.240]  I said, you'll have to figure that one out, Abdul.
[01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:16.240]  But we didn't have one death in 18 months.
[01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:17.240]  He knew.
[01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:18.240]  Not one death.
[01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:21.240]  And then to see the way we got out, like we were surrendering,
[01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:23.240]  like taking the military out first,
[01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:26.240]  leaving $85 billion worth of equipment behind,
[01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:27.240]  giving up Bagram.
[01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:28.240]  I was going to keep Bagram.
[01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:29.240]  I was getting out.
[01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:31.240]  But not for Afghanistan.
[01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:35.240]  It's one hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons.
[01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:37.240]  It's one of the biggest Air Force bases in the world,
[01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:40.240]  I think the biggest, with runways that go 10,000 feet.
[01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:44.240]  I was keeping that because of China, not because of Afghanistan.
[01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:45.240]  Right.
[01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:47.240]  And they left everything.
[01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:49.240]  They left in the dark of night.
[01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:50.240]  They left the lights on.
[01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:51.240]  They left the dogs, by the way.
[01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:52.240]  You know, the people say about the dogs.
[01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:53.240]  They left the dogs?
[01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:54.240]  They left the dogs.
[01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:55.240]  Everyone, you know, the dog lovers.
[01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:56.240]  And you got a lot of them.
[01:03:56.240 --> 01:03:57.240]  I love dogs.
[01:03:57.240 --> 01:03:58.240]  You love dogs.
[01:03:58.240 --> 01:03:59.240]  But they left the dogs.
[01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:00.240]  The people said, what?
[01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:03.240]  One of the first questions I got, what did they do with the dogs?
[01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:04.240]  Mostly German shepherds.
[01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:06.240]  They left them.
[01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:09.240]  What they did, the way they got out, was so horrible.
[01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:12.240]  OK, everybody knows that was their plan.
[01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:13.240]  That had nothing to do with me.
[01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:14.240]  I was getting out, too.
[01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:17.240]  We would have gotten out with strength and dignity.
[01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:19.240]  And what happened?
[01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:20.240]  They got out.
[01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:24.240]  And the other day, I hear, yeah, it was Trump's fault.
[01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:25.240]  Oh, that's right.
[01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:26.240]  It was Trump.
[01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:27.240]  Trump.
[01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:28.240]  I was gone for a long.
[01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:29.240]  We would have gotten out faster than them.
[01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:31.240]  We would have had all the equipment.
[01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:33.240]  We would have had the American citizens.
[01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:34.240]  We left hostages.
[01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:35.240]  We left Americans behind.
[01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:36.240]  Many.
[01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:37.240]  I think many more than you think.
[01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:39.240]  All right, this is a very powerful interview.
[01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:41.240]  The full interview is on Infowars.com.
[01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:43.240]  Post it on the live show feed.
[01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:44.240]  We're going to play some more next episode.
[01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:45.240]  But, Kit, a ton of news.
[01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:51.240]  And then we got big U.N. takeover news with Mike Adams and with Mr. Yan that's down there
[01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:53.240]  at the Darien Gap.
[01:04:53.240 --> 01:04:55.240]  Wait until you hear this in the third hour today.
[01:04:55.240 --> 01:04:57.240]  Critical intel straight ahead.
[01:04:58.240 --> 01:05:00.240]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:58.320 --> 01:05:08.160]  If Alex Jones runs for president in the Republican Party, he has a chance of winning.
[01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:15.120]  If you just tuned in, you may be noticing I'm wearing an Alex Jones for president 2024
[01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:16.120]  shirt.
[01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:19.120]  I am not seriously planning to run for president.
[01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:24.360]  This is an idea of the crew had, have a triggering shirt, kind of next level Alex Jones was right.
[01:05:24.360 --> 01:05:28.720]  There's Infowars.com in the back, Alex Jones for president 2024 on the front.
[01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:29.720]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:31.000]  It's made out of really nice fabric.
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:35.800]  It's high quality and it is a exclusive shirt to Infowars.com.
[01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:37.640]  And when the shirts are gone, they're gone.
[01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:44.920]  We're doing one run of Alex Jones for president 2024 shirts and we'll have a historic memento
[01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:48.720]  and be able to spread the word and meet a lot of like-minded people and you'll be able
[01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:50.400]  to keep us on the air.
[01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:51.400]  No way.
[01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:52.400]  No way.
[01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:53.400]  That's a bridge too far.
[01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:54.880]  No, it can't be.
[01:05:54.880 --> 01:05:57.520]  And I said on national television that he was going to win.
[01:05:57.520 --> 01:05:58.520]  At Infowars.com.
[01:05:58.520 --> 01:06:13.200]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the
[01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:16.200]  front lines of the Infowar.
[01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:18.840]  All right.
[01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:26.880]  We had Steve Madden on for about 30 minutes with us in the last hour and he concurred
[01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:27.880]  with me.
[01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:35.520]  He agreed vociferously that we've gone over the tipping point, not just here, but across
[01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:40.680]  the planet, that there is a globalist attack on humanity and a war for the world.
[01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:45.240]  And all these world leaders, not just here, not just Trump, not just Elon Musk, not just
[01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:52.840]  Ron Paul, Rand Paul, when the list just goes on and on, Robert Kennedy Jr., are exposing
[01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:59.440]  how the intelligence agencies have even taken control of most mid-sized companies and almost
[01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:00.760]  every bureaucracy.
[01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:09.120]  They send city council members, even in small towns, to New York and other places on these
[01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:15.720]  junket trips that are sometimes two weeks long, and give them little FBI ID cards, CIA
[01:07:15.720 --> 01:07:21.480]  ID cards that have another agency name, and they literally give them top secret clearances
[01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:24.320]  and their agents working against us.
[01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:27.760]  Tens of thousands of them are in each big tech company.
[01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:28.760]  It's all come out.
[01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:32.440]  And I've been trying to tell people this for years.
[01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:37.200]  I've shown you the documents, the funding, it exploded under Obama.
[01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:45.080]  It was going on 50, 60 years ago, but it was like an ounce in 1950, and then it was a pound
[01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:51.800]  in 1960, and then it was 1,000 pounds in 1970, then it was 50,000 pounds in 1980, let's use
[01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:56.960]  that as an analogy, and then it was a million pounds in 2000, and it's like a quadrillion
[01:07:56.960 --> 01:07:57.960]  pounds now.
[01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:10.120]  It's a bunch of nobodies playing Johnny Quest, playing James Bond, running around spoiling
[01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:12.160]  for a war with the American people.
[01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:23.360]  And then the cops, who are territorial, despite all their problems, they're just like everybody else, are territorial.
[01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:27.360]  And they're like, what the hell is this? So they're not been going along with it in most cities.
[01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:34.360]  And so they've got to be, quote, defunded until they come to heel, until they behave themselves.
[01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:40.360]  People say, well, why are you supporting the police? Well, because they haven't been going along with this, by and large.
[01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:47.360]  So whoever's not going along with it, I'm going to say, oh, that's good. You actually don't want to be a slave and destroyed?
[01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:59.360]  So America is discovering and the world is discovering that these big corporations are combined together in their big boards.
[01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:02.360]  They run the politicians. They get their people in charge.
[01:09:02.360 --> 01:09:08.360]  And then they've set up intelligence gathering and enforcement systems and are literally teaching their people.
[01:09:08.360 --> 01:09:10.360]  We've played the Veritas clips. You see it everywhere.
[01:09:10.360 --> 01:09:16.360]  You've seen the army clips where it's the big liberal sergeant and she's like, we're getting ready to crush the American resistance.
[01:09:16.360 --> 01:09:19.360]  We're going to take their guns. We'll kill them.
[01:09:19.360 --> 01:09:23.360]  And I'm just like, wow, you really have read military history books, haven't you?
[01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:26.360]  Oh, no, you haven't, jackass.
[01:09:26.330 --> 01:09:33.530]  But I have no desire to see that woman splattered all over the ground.
[01:09:33.530 --> 01:09:35.250]  She's an idiot.
[01:09:35.250 --> 01:09:38.290]  I'd rather get her brain straight.
[01:09:38.290 --> 01:09:46.970]  Gee, does the government really think when the gloves come off that you're going to win
[01:09:46.970 --> 01:09:48.769]  this physical war with us?
[01:09:48.769 --> 01:09:49.769]  No.
[01:09:49.769 --> 01:09:50.769]  Not now.
[01:09:50.769 --> 01:09:52.809]  Because people know who you are and what you did.
[01:09:53.050 --> 01:09:56.809]  Yeah, maybe five years ago, you might have been able to pull off a revolution and bring
[01:09:56.809 --> 01:09:57.970]  in a permanent tyranny.
[01:09:57.970 --> 01:09:59.769]  You might have gotten away with them.
[01:09:59.769 --> 01:10:01.450]  Let me give the New World Order report.
[01:10:01.450 --> 01:10:04.530]  Everybody knows I make a lot of good analysis and predictions.
[01:10:04.530 --> 01:10:05.970]  You've lost your ass.
[01:10:05.970 --> 01:10:07.130]  You're blown.
[01:10:07.130 --> 01:10:08.130]  You're done.
[01:10:08.130 --> 01:10:09.130]  Okay?
[01:10:09.130 --> 01:10:10.769]  You need to give up and stop it.
[01:10:10.769 --> 01:10:14.809]  And you can run off with your stolen wealth and live like kings, because we don't want
[01:10:14.809 --> 01:10:15.809]  this war with you.
[01:10:15.809 --> 01:10:17.290]  People say, well, why would you?
[01:10:17.290 --> 01:10:22.010]  It's called sending someone into abstention.
[01:10:22.010 --> 01:10:23.010]  That's what you do.
[01:10:23.010 --> 01:10:25.570]  Instead of having a big war with them and cornering them, because they can really wreck
[01:10:25.570 --> 01:10:30.250]  stuff, and start a nuclear war, we're like, hey, just go away.
[01:10:30.250 --> 01:10:36.970]  And we will not prosecute you, convict you, and hang you.
[01:10:36.970 --> 01:10:40.370]  But if you've got to go that way, we're not backing down.
[01:10:40.370 --> 01:10:41.530]  We're identifying you.
[01:10:41.530 --> 01:10:42.650]  We're beating you.
[01:10:42.650 --> 01:10:43.930]  We're not going away.
[01:10:43.930 --> 01:10:46.690]  Understand, there's nothing you can do to us to stop us.
[01:10:46.690 --> 01:10:47.930]  You can put us in jail.
[01:10:47.930 --> 01:10:48.930]  You can kill us.
[01:10:48.930 --> 01:10:50.210]  You can attack our families.
[01:10:50.410 --> 01:10:52.610]  No, our families are gone anyways, and we don't beat this.
[01:10:52.610 --> 01:10:55.930]  So that's what I call commitment.
[01:10:55.930 --> 01:11:00.490]  And people have to get it in their brain that you are under attack.
[01:11:00.490 --> 01:11:02.090]  That's not rhetoric.
[01:11:02.090 --> 01:11:06.610]  This government is more at war with you than communist China.
[01:11:06.610 --> 01:11:08.130]  Remember what Trump said?
[01:11:08.130 --> 01:11:11.210]  We played the clip last hour, but it was like a low-res Twitter clip.
[01:11:11.210 --> 01:11:12.370]  Did you guys find the HD yet?
[01:11:13.660 --> 01:11:18.260]  It's only a 30-minute interview. Okay, we're gonna have it, we're gonna have it
[01:11:18.260 --> 01:11:25.059]  in a minute, in a moment. I want to play the HD. When Trump says the biggest enemy is
[01:11:25.059 --> 01:11:31.260]  the globalists that have hijacked the country, A, that's true and B, everybody's
[01:11:31.260 --> 01:11:37.660]  saying it now and they cannot get away with this once that happens. So the
[01:11:37.660 --> 01:11:42.540]  mission was to expose their illegitimate, expose their out to get us, expose their
[01:11:42.540 --> 01:11:46.300]  horrible people, most of them are pedophiles at the top, it's all about their
[01:11:46.300 --> 01:11:54.380]  selfishness, they're Satanists and you're identified dumbass. Klaus Schwab and all
[01:11:54.380 --> 01:11:57.860]  of them write books and say over and over and we played the clips, well we're
[01:11:57.860 --> 01:12:00.620]  bringing in a global crisis to get rid of the old system and we'll be the
[01:12:00.620 --> 01:12:03.980]  saviors of bringing the new system. That only works if people don't know you're
[01:12:03.980 --> 01:12:06.580]  the bad guy.
[01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:10.599]  And I keep hammering this point because it's essential.
[01:12:10.599 --> 01:12:21.480]  We're in a war, they're the bad guys, 99.9999% of us are gonna be absolutely harmed by this
[01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:22.480]  in horrible ways.
[01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:25.320]  And by the way, 100% will be harmed.
[01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:31.320]  The tiny globalist elite of a few thousand owners of this fraud all fight with each other,
[01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:33.000]  all spy on each other.
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:34.519]  Most of their kids commit suicide.
[01:12:34.519 --> 01:12:37.000]  They are miserable scum.
[01:12:38.100 --> 01:12:44.000]  And they're projecting their hatred of themselves onto us. So everyone loses
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:50.540]  under this. It's a satanic plan. It comes to kill, steal, and destroy. Reject it. This
[01:12:50.540 --> 01:12:55.860]  is not even a discussion. It's not even a point. And it's not heroic to fight it.
[01:12:55.860 --> 01:13:01.160]  You'd have to have the most insane, blind, nihilistic courage to work for this
[01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:08.200]  thing. And destroy yourself just to be a horrible, nasty person? And feel like you're in charge
[01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:09.400]  for a season?
[01:13:09.630 --> 01:13:16.350]  You could be honorable, you could be strong, you could be part of the future, you could
[01:13:16.350 --> 01:13:21.030]  have God's providence, but so many of you are so far gone, I'm talking to the globalist,
[01:13:21.030 --> 01:13:25.270]  that you just don't even, I mean, you know what I'm saying is true, so you hate me because
[01:13:25.270 --> 01:13:30.630]  you know I made the right decision, and you made the wrong decision, and you have committed
[01:13:30.630 --> 01:13:35.350]  the ultimate sin by screwing kids and stuff like that, so you can't come back, so all
[01:13:35.350 --> 01:13:40.550]  you can do like your boss is claw us into hell with you, well guess what, you're not
[01:13:40.550 --> 01:13:44.430]  getting my soul, scum, I'm out of your grasp and you know it.
[01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:47.680]  Let's play the clip, here it is.
[01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:53.680]  They said to me the other day, one of your fellow journalists said,
[01:13:53.680 --> 01:13:58.680]  who's the biggest problem, sir, is it China? Could it be Russia? Could it be North Korea?
[01:13:58.680 --> 01:14:00.680]  No, I said the biggest problem is from within.
[01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:08.680]  It's these sick, radical people from within, because we can handle, if we're smart, we can handle Russia, China.
[01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:14.680]  I did. I took in billions and billions, hundreds of billions of dollars from China.
[01:14:14.680 --> 01:14:17.680]  No other president took in anything. And they respected me.
[01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:21.680]  Here's the same thing, you know, I told him you can't go into Taiwan.
[01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:25.680]  You can't. You can't do it. I won't tell you exactly what I said,
[01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:28.680]  but it was something that probably a lot of people wouldn't like if they heard it.
[01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:32.680]  But it was very tough. Don't go into Taiwan. If you do, we're going to have problems.
[01:14:32.680 --> 01:14:36.680]  Other than that, we're going to be great relationship. We're going to have a great relationship.
[01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:43.680]  And he said to me when I said we're going to do something, if he goes, no, no, no, you wouldn't do it.
[01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:48.680]  I'll do that. I swear I'll do that. And he didn't believe me, but he believed me 10 percent.
[01:14:48.680 --> 01:14:54.680]  And what he says about strength and being honorable, people knowing he's not playing games, that's important.
[01:14:54.680 --> 01:14:59.680]  He gets more into the globalist being the main enemy, but that's what we need to see more of.
[01:15:00.680 --> 01:15:05.680]  Not 30 seconds on it, but 30 minutes on it. Just like the full speech of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:11.680]  on Infowars.com, where he played five minutes last hour, where he just lays out the whole shooting match.
[01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:15.680]  And who's who and how it works and how they do it.
[01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:20.680]  So when you get around these InfraGard people, that's one of the first groups,
[01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:24.680]  they've got a bunch of them, just say, hey, dude, I know you're reporting to the Justice Department
[01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:27.680]  and get little communiques from the CIA through a front company.
[01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:31.680]  I know you feel really powerful. You're called a traitor and a quizzling dumbass.
[01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:35.680]  You're not supposed to be operating domestically in this country with your spy crap.
[01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:41.680]  We know who you are and we're standing against you. You understand that?
[01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:50.680]  But they just feel like, oh, I get directives from the Justice Department and the CIA. I'm special.
[01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:57.680]  Yeah, you're as special as a landfill. You're a joke. You're a traitor.
[01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:06.680]  If Alex Jones runs for president in the Republican Party, he has a chance of winning.
[01:16:09.680 --> 01:16:14.680]  If you just tuned in, you may be noticing I'm wearing an Alex Jones for president 2024 shirt.
[01:16:14.680 --> 01:16:17.680]  I am not seriously planning to run for president.
[01:16:17.680 --> 01:16:22.680]  This is an idea the crew had, have a triggering shirt, kind of next level. Alex Jones is right.
[01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:26.680]  There's Infowars.com in the back, Alex Jones for president 2024 on the front.
[01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:30.680]  It's a fundraiser shirt. It's made out of really nice fabric. It's high quality.
[01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:35.680]  And it is a exclusive shirt to Infowarsstore.com. And when the shirts are gone, they're gone.
[01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:40.680]  We're doing one run of Alex Jones for president 2024 shirts.
[01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:45.680]  And we'll have a historic memento, be able to spread the word, meet a lot of like-minded people.
[01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:48.680]  And you'll be able to keep us on the air.
[01:16:48.680 --> 01:16:52.680]  No way. No way. That's a bridge too far. That's no, it can't be.
[01:16:52.680 --> 01:16:55.680]  And I said on national television that he was going to win.
[01:16:55.680 --> 01:16:58.680]  At Infowarsstore.com.
[01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:03.680]  Turbo Force is back, sold out for eight months, and it's Turbo Force Plus.

[01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:22.680]  It's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time-release over 10 hours.
[01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:24.680]  Should be called 10-hour energy.
[01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:29.680]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids
[01:17:29.680 --> 01:17:35.680]  that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name it.
[01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:39.680]  It is the super fuel.
[01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:42.680]  Rain Force Plus is great. Rain Force Alt is great.
[01:17:42.680 --> 01:17:44.680]  They're two different nootropics. They go good with this.
[01:17:44.680 --> 01:17:48.680]  But this is the King Kong. This is the boss.
[01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:52.680]  Turbo Force, back in stock, discounted, Infowarsstore.com.
[01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:55.680]  More power, more strength, more energy.
[01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:02.680]  I talk a lot about the great successes Infowars has had.
[01:18:02.680 --> 01:18:04.680]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:08.680]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[01:18:08.680 --> 01:18:13.680]  When we talk about the crew at Infowars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:17.680]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:22.680]  And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day,
[01:18:22.680 --> 01:18:24.680]  five, six, seven days a week.
[01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:26.680]  It's really just incredible.
[01:18:26.680 --> 01:18:30.680]  So for myself and the whole Infowars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[01:18:30.680 --> 01:18:36.680]  I want to encourage you now to realize that Infowars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[01:18:36.680 --> 01:18:38.680]  I know you spread the word. I know you pray for us.
[01:18:38.680 --> 01:18:39.680]  And that's wonderful. Keep doing it.
[01:18:39.680 --> 01:18:43.680]  But most viewers and listeners never go to Infowarsstore.com
[01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:46.680]  and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life
[01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:48.680]  while at the same time keeping us on air.
[01:18:48.680 --> 01:18:52.680]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:18:52.680 --> 01:18:56.680]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to Infowarsstore.com,
[01:18:56.680 --> 01:18:57.680]  our funding problems will be over.
[01:18:57.680 --> 01:18:59.680]  Please take action now.
[01:19:00.680 --> 01:19:03.680]  Humanity is in a fight for its very life.
[01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:09.680]  And Infowars for decades has been at the very forefront of the fight for a pro-human future.
[01:19:09.680 --> 01:19:11.680]  We can't stay on air without your help.
[01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:13.680]  And I want to thank you all for your past support.
[01:19:13.680 --> 01:19:17.680]  And I want to encourage those of you that have never bought products at Infowarsstore.com
[01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:21.680]  to go there and experience how amazing these products really are.
[01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:25.680]  Ultimate Bone Broth finally sold out for over two years back in stock.

[01:19:46.680 --> 01:19:49.680]  are exclusively available at Infowarsstore.com as well.
[01:19:49.680 --> 01:19:51.680]  In the last month, I got a little busy so I didn't sign the books.
[01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:52.680]  We didn't have them for sale.
[01:19:52.680 --> 01:19:54.680]  But now, I signed the last books.
[01:19:54.680 --> 01:19:55.680]  You can get them right now.
[01:19:59.680 --> 01:20:03.680]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:05.680]  it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:07.490 --> 01:20:18.050]  All right, I got more good news for you, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:20:18.050 --> 01:20:22.650]  Yeah, we've been getting our asses kicked for a long time, but humanity is waking up.
[01:20:22.650 --> 01:20:23.650]  We got up.
[01:20:23.650 --> 01:20:28.610]  Now we're stomping new world order ass, intellectually, spiritually, economically, and as we realize
[01:20:28.610 --> 01:20:33.410]  we're in the fight of our lives, the fight of generations to come, we're going to win.
[01:20:33.410 --> 01:20:34.410]  You can smell it.
[01:20:34.410 --> 01:20:35.410]  You can see it.
[01:20:35.410 --> 01:20:37.370]  You can taste it.
[01:20:37.370 --> 01:20:40.010]  And some of us are going to have to make big sacrifices.
[01:20:40.010 --> 01:20:41.010]  Some of us are going to have to die.
[01:20:41.010 --> 01:20:45.210]  Some of us are going to have to go to prison or be persecuted, but hey, we're going to
[01:20:45.210 --> 01:20:46.210]  save the children.
[01:20:46.210 --> 01:20:49.370]  And God's watching, and this is all just a test.
[01:20:49.370 --> 01:20:51.210]  She'll pass the test.
[01:20:51.210 --> 01:20:52.050]  Okay.
[01:20:52.230 --> 01:20:58.629]  It's hard to cover these subjects because they're so horrible.
[01:20:58.629 --> 01:21:05.950]  And I remember Christy Lee, one of our great reporters, moved here like three years ago
[01:21:05.950 --> 01:21:08.830]  and she's got a bunch of kids, like four or five kids.
[01:21:08.830 --> 01:21:11.790]  And some are in elementary, some are middle school, high school.
[01:21:11.790 --> 01:21:18.709]  And she got really upset because the Austin AISD middle school, sixth grade, I guess that's
[01:21:18.709 --> 01:21:24.230]  intermediate, had that famous book that we're not going to put on screen.
[01:21:24.230 --> 01:21:31.709]  It's in all the libraries, most of them, that literally shows children having sex with other
[01:21:31.709 --> 01:21:33.190]  children and adults.
[01:21:33.190 --> 01:21:37.950]  It's a cartoon, but it's a graphic, like a comic book.
[01:21:37.950 --> 01:21:44.950]  And she came to me and she said, can I put this on air?
[01:21:44.950 --> 01:21:53.589]  And I had seen some of it in articles, but I went in my office and opened it up.
[01:21:53.589 --> 01:21:57.509]  And I felt like a criminal looking at this because I've been blessed to never run into
[01:21:57.509 --> 01:22:00.150]  child porn online without even looking for porn.
[01:22:00.150 --> 01:22:03.669]  I've run into horses having sex with people and, you know, women eating crap.
[01:22:03.669 --> 01:22:07.230]  And I mean, you know, especially in the early days of the web, you just click on something
[01:22:07.230 --> 01:22:10.429]  and it would just be like, oh my gosh, you know, two girls and a cup, you're like, what
[01:22:10.429 --> 01:22:11.429]  is this?
[01:22:11.429 --> 01:22:13.629]  And it's like a woman eating feces.
[01:22:13.629 --> 01:22:15.589]  And I hate to talk about that, but that's out there.
[01:22:15.589 --> 01:22:16.870]  That's the stuff that like scars you.
[01:22:16.870 --> 01:22:17.870]  It's disgusting.
[01:22:17.870 --> 01:22:18.870]  It's gross.
[01:22:18.870 --> 01:22:21.750]  You're like, who the hell does this?
[01:22:21.750 --> 01:22:24.870]  You click on a link and it's a dog, you know, St. Bernard having sex with a woman.
[01:22:24.870 --> 01:22:25.870]  That stuff's out there.
[01:22:25.870 --> 01:22:31.030]  But I've been blessed to never see child porn.
[01:22:31.030 --> 01:22:37.070]  And I'm sitting there looking at this and reading it and getting angry.
[01:22:37.070 --> 01:22:42.950]  And it says on the back of the book, we showed it on air, AISD, Austin Independent School
[01:22:42.950 --> 01:22:44.190]  District.
[01:22:44.190 --> 01:22:48.589]  She goes down there and the police throw her out, not letting her at the school board
[01:22:48.589 --> 01:22:50.309]  read the damn book.
[01:22:50.309 --> 01:22:59.870]  So the police won't let you read the book in public, but you can give it to 11 year olds,
[01:22:59.870 --> 01:23:00.469]  10 year olds.
[01:23:00.590 --> 01:23:11.310]  Now, I got stacks of it today with stuff just as bad or worse with elementary students.
[01:23:11.310 --> 01:23:17.590]  And I don't want to have a heart attack, so I'm not going to read what's in the books.
[01:23:17.590 --> 01:23:20.430]  But the point is, is that I have children.
[01:23:20.430 --> 01:23:22.890]  This is an assault on my family and my children.
[01:23:22.890 --> 01:23:27.790]  And these evil perverts want to wreck my children's minds, your children's minds.
[01:23:27.790 --> 01:23:32.630]  And this is more dangerous than somebody walking up to your 10-year-old and knocking their
[01:23:32.630 --> 01:23:33.630]  front teeth out.
[01:23:33.630 --> 01:23:36.390]  Because they can get fake teeth, they're still going to live.
[01:23:36.390 --> 01:23:43.930]  When you screw up their minds and you do this kind of stuff, it is irrevocable child abuse.
[01:23:43.930 --> 01:23:44.990]  And the left calls it...
[01:23:45.270 --> 01:23:52.270]  book banning that you don't want pedophilic...
[01:23:51.810 --> 01:24:01.090]  I mean a bunch of these books describe children and their neighbor in one of
[01:24:01.090 --> 01:24:05.810]  the books says, does your neighbor want you to go in the shed? Is he a nice man?
[01:24:05.810 --> 01:24:13.850]  He's gonna suck your D-I-C. And you're reading, you're like, this isn't real. Hey
[01:24:13.850 --> 01:24:19.130]  that man, why don't you get in the car with him? I mean this is priming to be
[01:24:19.130 --> 01:24:25.890]  kidnapped and murdered. I mean these are psychotics. And the rest of them just
[01:24:25.890 --> 01:24:32.250]  follow orders and say, well this is LGBT whatever. So I said I would get to
[01:24:32.250 --> 01:24:37.770]  positive stuff. That's just one of the articles in my stack.
[01:24:36.070 --> 01:24:46.070]  Report. School district in Maryland makes LGBTQ books. Mandatory reading.
[01:24:47.280 --> 01:24:54.280]  And it's all about having sex with men if you're a man, having sex with girls.
[01:24:54.280 --> 01:24:58.280]  Do you like girls? Maybe you're a lesbian for elementary school students.
[01:24:58.280 --> 01:25:01.280]  I mean, this is stuff six and seven-year-olds read.
[01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:04.280]  This is prime evil.
[01:25:04.280 --> 01:25:10.280]  I mean, if parents were sitting around with their six-year-old telling them about sex, they're perverts, folks.
[01:25:10.280 --> 01:25:14.280]  You don't tell children about sex until they're about to hit puberty.

[01:25:15.470 --> 01:25:25.310]  I remember I was about 10 or 11 I look like I was about 14 my mom and dad on
[01:25:25.310 --> 01:25:29.270]  trip to Arkansas sat me down while we're hiking up on the top of a mountain they
[01:25:29.270 --> 01:25:33.630]  said listen son you're really good-looking and you're gonna have a lot
[01:25:33.630 --> 01:25:37.630]  of women come after you and you can get diseases you get hurt and you really
[01:25:37.630 --> 01:25:41.030]  need to try to not you know you find somebody you love and get married we
[01:25:41.030 --> 01:25:45.350]  just want you to know about this and blah blah blah I was 11 years old so my
[01:25:45.350 --> 01:25:50.870]  parents sat me down at a park bench on top of mountain in Hot Springs Arkansas
[01:25:50.870 --> 01:25:55.310]  for 30 minutes and told me about the birds and the bees and boy were they
[01:25:55.310 --> 01:26:02.830]  right because the women started coming but the point is is that is that I was
[01:26:02.830 --> 01:26:08.790]  11 years old and my parents told me about sex and I knew about sex and it
[01:26:08.790 --> 01:26:12.590]  seemed my dad's playboys under the bed and stuff like that but the point is is
[01:26:12.590 --> 01:26:15.550]  that and I'd been over to friends houses around the time and you know they
[01:26:15.550 --> 01:26:20.110]  had like you know 80s porn on or whatever and I went wow those women but
[01:26:20.110 --> 01:26:24.990]  but the point is is that that was the normal process of life probably too
[01:26:24.990 --> 01:26:29.910]  racy wasn't good that I got exposed to that in fact I wish I wouldn't have been
[01:26:29.910 --> 01:26:33.350]  that early because I barely survived it I was a
[01:26:33.350 --> 01:26:37.630]  wild man I was a Tomcat but
[01:26:36.960 --> 01:26:42.960]  That was still a normal biological event.
[01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:47.960]  This is artificially coming in before they even hit puberty and confusing them on purpose.
[01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:49.960]  It's pure evil.
[01:26:49.960 --> 01:26:52.960]  And it is the total corporate model.
[01:26:54.120 --> 01:27:01.120]  To jam this into our families and take children to the most disgusting, quote, gay pride parades.
[01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:06.120]  They're not gay pride parades. I've seen countless videos. We can't even put them on TV.
[01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:12.120]  Eating crap. Cutting themselves. Sticking needles through their faces.
[01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:18.120]  One-upping each other. Men having sex in public. Pissing everywhere.
[01:27:18.120 --> 01:27:21.120]  People are like, man, why are you going through all this?
[01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:25.120]  Well, it's what's going on in the city streets of Austin, Texas, and San Francisco,
[01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:30.120]  and now little towns around the country where they're flaunting it in your face
[01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:33.120]  and saying we're dominating you, we're controlling you.
[01:27:33.120 --> 01:27:40.120]  And then every major Fortune 500 company that you look into, except for a handful,
[01:27:40.120 --> 01:27:44.120]  is funding the most weaponized garbage.
[01:27:44.120 --> 01:27:47.120]  I remember 20 years ago, Nickelodeon documents got leaked,
[01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:51.120]  and they said we're going to form relationships with kids when they're seven or eight.
[01:27:51.120 --> 01:27:54.120]  We want to sexualize them early.
[01:27:54.120 --> 01:27:58.120]  Because if we can form their identity early, before they naturally form it,
[01:27:58.120 --> 01:28:04.120]  we can add a political movement and any corporate sponsorships to that node.
[01:28:04.120 --> 01:28:06.120]  So what they're putting is handles on your kid.
[01:28:06.120 --> 01:28:10.120]  If they can screw your kid up when they're five or six or seven years old
[01:28:10.120 --> 01:28:16.120]  and put them on the fast track to be mutilated or castrated or chemicalized or brainwashed,
[01:28:16.120 --> 01:28:19.120]  they are owning them.
[01:28:19.120 --> 01:28:23.120]  And it's a literal army of perverts and sickos and pedophiles
[01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:30.120]  that are literally doing it for power and control.
[01:28:30.120 --> 01:28:34.120]  Now, that said, here's the good news when we come back.
[01:28:34.120 --> 01:28:39.120]  The backlash has gone into Turbo Drive.
[01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:43.120]  A day ago, Anheuser-Busch had lost $3 billion.
[01:28:43.120 --> 01:28:45.120]  Today, this morning, it was $4 billion.
[01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:50.120]  As of the last break, in the last three hours, it's $5 billion.
[01:28:50.120 --> 01:28:53.120]  They're going to lose $10 billion by the end of the week.
[01:28:53.120 --> 01:28:55.120]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[01:28:57.940 --> 01:29:04.940]  They decided to not perp walking, not put him in handcuffs, not do a mugshot because they knew that that would help Trump.
[01:29:04.940 --> 01:29:09.940]  Didn't they know this would backfire? We were waiting for the mugshot. We learned today they wouldn't have it.
[01:29:09.940 --> 01:29:15.940]  So we've made our own. And it says political prisoner with an image of President Trump.

[01:32:55.940 --> 01:33:05.940]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:07.610 --> 01:33:34.009]  Alright, we're back live, I'm getting some good news here and some really scary World
[01:33:34.009 --> 01:33:43.330]  War 3 news, so the Dylan Mulvaney stunt, and the guy's Andy Kaufman, he's a comedian, he's
[01:33:43.330 --> 01:33:46.969]  getting super rich doing it, a bunch of other comedians are doing it now, they know big
[01:33:46.969 --> 01:33:51.650]  corporations will hire a man that makes fun of women and objectifies women and steals
[01:33:51.650 --> 01:33:57.769]  their identity and acts like a total clown, so now after people saw billions of dollars
[01:33:57.769 --> 01:34:02.570]  lost, it was a couple billion four or five days ago, now it's five billion, a billion
[01:34:02.570 --> 01:34:07.929]  of that just today, so it's accelerating, Anheuser-Busch products are piling up everywhere,
[01:34:07.929 --> 01:34:13.170]  no one's buying them, and we're talking like 80% reduction they're reporting, now the company
[01:34:13.170 --> 01:34:18.410]  that owns Olay, one of the biggest cosmetic makers in the world, they decided, well, this
[01:34:18.410 --> 01:34:25.730]  is very important, if we can destroy our brand, let's do it immediately, and so have a bunch
[01:34:25.730 --> 01:34:34.170]  of other companies, they're like, this is a fabulous idea, Nike, this is a fabulous
[01:34:34.170 --> 01:34:40.889]  idea, and you sit back and you go, this is suicidal, this is kamikaze, yeah, what you
[01:34:40.889 --> 01:34:47.889]  do in a war, I'm going to explain this again, the globalists have created quadrillion upon
[01:34:47.889 --> 01:34:53.769]  quadrillion, last time I talked to an economist, we looked at numbers, I want to say 15 quadrillion
[01:34:53.809 --> 01:35:00.490]  in derivatives, that's a quadrillion, how many billions is a quadrillion, how many trillions
[01:35:00.490 --> 01:35:07.490]  is a quadrillion, look it up, it's astronomical, they've created more fiat currency than the
[01:35:08.260 --> 01:35:14.420]  world. And if you tried to buy everything in the world, we did the numbers years ago,
[01:35:14.420 --> 01:35:20.020]  it's much worse now, it's going straight up. You could buy the whole world up at current
[01:35:20.020 --> 01:35:26.860]  asset prices thousands of times. So you go, well, what is that for? They don't care if
[01:35:26.860 --> 01:35:38.020]  Hollywood gets destroyed. They don't care if Anheuser-Busch goes belly up. It's a weapon.
[01:35:38.020 --> 01:35:46.740]  I'm going to explain, I'm going to explain the key right now. You look at the national
[01:35:46.740 --> 01:35:47.780]  debt, put it back on screen.
[01:35:47.980 --> 01:36:02.580]  $31 trillion, and then the change, $677 billion, $79.8 million, you think, well you just said
[01:36:02.580 --> 01:36:13.660]  a quadrillion, that's thousands of times that, quadrillions, yeah, they have unlimited money,
[01:36:13.660 --> 01:36:22.059]  they just maneuver the government into default level debt, so they can create and buy up
[01:36:22.059 --> 01:36:32.540]  any brewery they want, and so when they fire Olay as a bullet or a missile, when they fire
[01:36:32.540 --> 01:36:37.500]  Nike or Anheuser-Busch, you're like, well this is insane, why did all these other companies
[01:36:37.500 --> 01:36:45.480]  join them, because they have these UN global government registries, where they give a social
[01:36:45.480 --> 01:36:50.299]  credit score to the company in the future of whether or not it will be given money,
[01:36:50.299 --> 01:36:57.179]  so Anheuser-Busch just guaranteed that they'll be given trillions in the future, Olay just
[01:36:57.179 --> 01:37:01.139]  guaranteed that, Nike just guaranteed that, because here's the key, now listen to me,
[01:37:01.139 --> 01:37:06.660]  nobody else has figured this out, but the globalists admit it themselves, because under
[01:37:06.660 --> 01:37:12.299]  the social credit score in the coming system, you'll only be able to get Anheuser-Busch
[01:37:12.299 --> 01:37:20.179]  and Nike and Olay, remember what, remember what, about six years ago, seven years ago
[01:37:20.179 --> 01:37:24.419]  when he was running for president, remember what Bernie Sanders said?
[01:37:24.640 --> 01:37:34.800]  He said, when I go into a grocery store, there are 30 different types of deodorant.
[01:37:34.800 --> 01:37:38.520]  I don't need that choice.
[01:37:38.520 --> 01:37:41.960]  There should be one deodorant.
[01:37:41.960 --> 01:37:43.820]  That's how they think.
[01:37:43.820 --> 01:37:46.420]  Total consolidation.
[01:37:46.420 --> 01:37:48.160]  Where they have the brand.
[01:37:48.160 --> 01:37:52.640]  And it won't be one, you'll have three or four choices all owned by the same people.
[01:37:52.640 --> 01:37:54.480]  And so they're taking one for the team.
[01:37:54.480 --> 01:37:57.640]  Yeah, they'll have a bunch of carnage, yeah, it'll ruin brands.
[01:37:57.640 --> 01:38:00.240]  They don't care about Hollywood.
[01:38:00.240 --> 01:38:01.960]  They don't care about Anheuser-Busch.
[01:38:01.960 --> 01:38:03.960]  They don't care about their stockholders.
[01:38:03.960 --> 01:38:08.200]  It's a weapon system.
[01:38:08.200 --> 01:38:09.960]  But here's the good news.
[01:38:09.960 --> 01:38:13.080]  They haven't gotten their social credit score in here yet.
[01:38:13.080 --> 01:38:14.720]  They've only gotten it really in China.
[01:38:14.720 --> 01:38:18.600]  It's partially going in now all over the world.
[01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:23.240]  So if you go to the Amish or go to the local slaughterhouse, and they're popping up now
[01:38:23.240 --> 01:38:28.360]  despite regulators harassing them, only three major meatpackers, but suddenly a few percentage
[01:38:28.360 --> 01:38:33.240]  points out there is local folks butchering it at their own farms, buying it right there
[01:38:33.240 --> 01:38:36.440]  through free trade associations, through societies.
[01:38:36.440 --> 01:38:40.340]  It's like in the old days, most Texas counties were dry.
[01:38:40.340 --> 01:38:43.720]  So when you went to the Mexican food restaurant when I was a kid, my dad or mom wanted a margarita
[01:38:43.720 --> 01:38:47.680]  or a beer, you just signed a little card, paid the $5 membership.
[01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:50.880]  But now you're a member of their private club.
[01:38:50.880 --> 01:38:55.040]  And now they can serve you alcohol because there were laws against restaurants serving
[01:38:55.040 --> 01:38:58.640]  alcohol in Texas.
[01:38:58.640 --> 01:39:02.600]  But now you're in the club, show, oh, I'm in a club.
[01:39:02.600 --> 01:39:03.600]  I can go get eggs.
[01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:04.600]  I can go get beef.
[01:39:04.600 --> 01:39:05.600]  I can go get milk.
[01:39:05.600 --> 01:39:06.600]  I can go get beans.
[01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:07.600]  I can get peas.
[01:39:07.600 --> 01:39:09.360]  I can get corn.
[01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:10.360]  I can get wheat.
[01:39:10.360 --> 01:39:11.120]  I can get anything I want.
[01:39:12.330 --> 01:39:15.330]  And as soon as that happens, it's over.
[01:39:15.330 --> 01:39:19.330]  So we look at 2%, 3%, 4% of the eggs,
[01:39:19.330 --> 01:39:21.330]  the chicken, the beef, it's around,
[01:39:21.330 --> 01:39:22.330]  some areas it's 5%.
[01:39:22.330 --> 01:39:23.330]  Some states are 10%.
[01:39:23.330 --> 01:39:25.330]  People are getting it directly from the farmer.
[01:39:25.330 --> 01:39:28.330]  You get it cheaper, you get it better, it's great.
[01:39:29.330 --> 01:39:32.330]  But as soon as they get their unified system in
[01:39:32.330 --> 01:39:36.330]  and the SDRs and the systems,
[01:39:36.330 --> 01:39:37.330]  central bank digital currencies,
[01:39:37.330 --> 01:39:40.330]  won't work anywhere but the box stores,
[01:39:40.330 --> 01:39:41.330]  that's their game over.
[01:39:41.330 --> 01:39:45.330]  So that's their war where they're trying to get to.
[01:39:46.330 --> 01:39:50.330]  That's why going to the farmer's market
[01:39:50.330 --> 01:39:51.330]  and like going, you know,
[01:39:51.330 --> 01:39:53.330]  I'm not going to the big grocery store for,
[01:39:53.330 --> 01:39:55.330]  I'm going to go, and you're like,
[01:39:55.330 --> 01:39:58.330]  wow, I didn't know they had sausage and beef
[01:39:58.330 --> 01:40:01.330]  and poultry and all the vegetables I needed.
[01:40:01.330 --> 01:40:03.330]  I didn't know they had it all here.
[01:40:03.330 --> 01:40:05.330]  And pretty soon, you're not even going
[01:40:05.330 --> 01:40:07.330]  to the main grocery store anymore.
[01:40:08.330 --> 01:40:10.330]  So that's the revolution, folks.
[01:40:10.330 --> 01:40:12.330]  So when you look at them and you go,
[01:40:12.330 --> 01:40:14.330]  they lost 5 billion this week?
[01:40:14.330 --> 01:40:17.330]  Anheuser-Busch, they're losing?
[01:40:18.330 --> 01:40:20.330]  They believe they're going to win
[01:40:20.330 --> 01:40:21.330]  through attrition over time.
[01:40:21.330 --> 01:40:22.330]  But the good news is,
[01:40:22.330 --> 01:40:24.330]  people are seeing the success of this
[01:40:24.330 --> 01:40:26.330]  and they're now didn't just,
[01:40:26.330 --> 01:40:28.330]  they're like, I remember them last week,
[01:40:28.330 --> 01:40:29.330]  they're like, well, don't worry,
[01:40:29.330 --> 01:40:30.330]  they'll only go after Bud Light.
[01:40:30.330 --> 01:40:34.330]  No, the whole Anheuser-Busch family is belly up.
[01:40:34.330 --> 01:40:35.330]  Good.
[01:40:36.330 --> 01:40:37.330]  I mean, family.
[01:40:37.330 --> 01:40:39.330]  I mean, the whole family of their alcohol
[01:40:39.330 --> 01:40:41.330]  that all tastes like rat piss.
[01:40:41.330 --> 01:40:44.330]  They sold the idea that it's a common man beer.
[01:40:44.330 --> 01:40:47.330]  No, it's terrible, in my view.
[01:40:47.330 --> 01:40:52.330]  But the point is, is that people are done with it
[01:40:52.330 --> 01:40:54.330]  and they're figuring out parent companies
[01:40:54.330 --> 01:40:56.330]  and they're figuring out everything this company has
[01:40:56.330 --> 01:40:59.330]  and they're rejecting it en masse.
[01:40:59.330 --> 01:41:01.330]  And the globalists will still reward them
[01:41:01.330 --> 01:41:02.330]  and prop them up.
[01:41:02.330 --> 01:41:03.330]  The point is, it'll be like CNN
[01:41:03.330 --> 01:41:05.330]  paying to be aired in the airport and the hotels.
[01:41:05.330 --> 01:41:06.330]  It's a joke.
[01:41:07.050 --> 01:41:15.210]  So, this is a very positive thing, and this is how you do real revolutions in the future
[01:41:15.210 --> 01:41:16.770]  and in the current time.
[01:41:16.770 --> 01:41:20.250]  Is information warfare, is your decisions the things you do, and I know this is all
[01:41:20.250 --> 01:41:22.650]  common sense, you're like, tell me something I don't know.
[01:41:22.650 --> 01:41:27.810]  Well, this is a huge success, and it's happening everywhere.
[01:41:27.810 --> 01:41:30.570]  So when you can, stay at a mom and pop hotel.
[01:41:30.570 --> 01:41:32.450]  When you can, eat at a mom and pop.
[01:41:32.450 --> 01:41:35.690]  When you can, find out who the local brewery is, get that beer.
[01:41:35.690 --> 01:41:37.690]  Do not spend your money.
[01:41:37.690 --> 01:41:39.770]  Don't go to the big super medical center.
[01:41:39.770 --> 01:41:41.210]  Find a good doctor.
[01:41:41.210 --> 01:41:42.970]  We will create the economy we need.
[01:41:42.970 --> 01:41:44.790]  We will create the economy that works for us.
[01:41:44.790 --> 01:41:46.290]  We will do it through decisions.
[01:41:46.290 --> 01:41:51.370]  That's why we're trying to take the decision-making process away with the central bank digital
[01:41:51.370 --> 01:41:55.610]  currencies, with the social credit score, with the medical vaccine ID, with the social
[01:41:55.610 --> 01:42:00.530]  credit score system that goes into the universal basic income.
[01:42:00.530 --> 01:42:07.890]  Destroy the economy, so you got to be on welfare, and got to spend the money where they say.
[01:42:07.890 --> 01:42:13.050]  Bud Light's Dylan Mulvaney trans stunt cost the company $4 billion.
[01:42:13.050 --> 01:42:14.050]  Actually not.
[01:42:14.050 --> 01:42:15.050]  Now it's $5 billion.
[01:42:15.050 --> 01:42:17.970]  Dylan Mulvaney says Bud Light critics don't understand her.
[01:42:17.970 --> 01:42:19.410]  No, you're a comedian.
[01:42:19.410 --> 01:42:20.410]  You're a man.
[01:42:20.410 --> 01:42:24.650]  As Anheuser-Busch suffers massive losses.
[01:42:24.650 --> 01:42:30.130]  Country music star John Rich stops selling Bud Light at a bar after they promote radical
[01:42:30.130 --> 01:42:32.170]  trans ideology.
[01:42:32.170 --> 01:42:33.170]  That's it.
[01:42:33.170 --> 01:42:35.750]  We exodus like Moses out of Egypt.
[01:42:35.750 --> 01:42:37.330]  We exodus from them.
[01:42:37.330 --> 01:42:39.530]  We support the independent systems.
[01:42:39.530 --> 01:42:42.610]  We shun the enemy.
[01:42:42.610 --> 01:42:45.010]  And we win.
[01:42:45.010 --> 01:42:47.890]  But you can't do it if you're not aware of the enemy operation.
[01:42:47.890 --> 01:42:50.890]  But we are, and we're circumnavigating their tyranny.
[01:42:50.890 --> 01:42:54.530]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with the big war news.
[01:42:54.530 --> 01:42:55.530]  It's important.
[01:42:55.530 --> 01:42:59.570]  Stay with us.
[01:42:59.570 --> 01:43:04.370]  Turbo Force is back, sold out for eight months, and it's Turbo Force Plus.
[01:43:04.370 --> 01:43:06.530]  We made it even stronger.
[01:43:06.530 --> 01:43:10.450]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere.
[01:43:10.450 --> 01:43:17.170]  Turbo Force is back in stock at Infowarsstore.com or AAA253-3139.
[01:43:17.170 --> 01:43:23.650]  It's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time release over 10 hours.
[01:43:23.650 --> 01:43:25.370]  It should be called 10-hour energy.
[01:43:25.370 --> 01:43:30.810]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids
[01:43:30.810 --> 01:43:36.050]  that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name
[01:43:36.050 --> 01:43:37.050]  it.
[01:43:37.050 --> 01:43:40.410]  It is the super fuel.
[01:43:40.410 --> 01:43:41.890]  Rain Force Plus is great.
[01:43:41.890 --> 01:43:42.890]  Rain Force Ultra is great.
[01:43:42.890 --> 01:43:43.890]  They're two different nootropics.
[01:43:43.890 --> 01:43:44.970]  They go good with this.
[01:43:44.970 --> 01:43:47.730]  But this is the King Kong.
[01:43:47.730 --> 01:43:49.130]  This is the boss.
[01:43:49.130 --> 01:43:53.250]  Turbo Force, back in stock, discounted, Infowarsstore.com.
[01:43:53.250 --> 01:43:59.850]  More power, more strength, more energy.
[01:43:59.850 --> 01:44:07.970]  I intend to take the Infowars armored truck out, or the Infowars tank as it's so lovingly
[01:44:07.970 --> 01:44:08.970]  called.
[01:44:08.970 --> 01:44:11.930]  You came through yesterday and shopped at Infowarsstore.com, so I'm going to be able
[01:44:11.930 --> 01:44:12.930]  to take the truck out.
[01:44:41.930 --> 01:45:05.930]  I want to say Brain Force is great.
[01:45:05.930 --> 01:45:07.930]  I want to say Turbo Force is amazing.
[01:45:07.930 --> 01:45:08.930]  It is.
[01:45:08.930 --> 01:45:09.930]  I took it with fish oil.
[01:45:09.930 --> 01:45:10.930]  It's like the fish oil is it.
[01:45:10.930 --> 01:45:11.930]  The fish oil is better than it.
[01:45:11.930 --> 01:45:12.930]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[01:45:12.930 --> 01:45:13.930]  Fish oil is liquid energy.
[01:45:13.930 --> 01:45:14.930]  Brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[01:45:14.930 --> 01:45:15.930]  Krill oil is the best.
[01:45:15.930 --> 01:45:16.930]  And it'll give you the damn burps.
[01:45:16.930 --> 01:45:17.930]  And I'm just sorry.
[01:45:17.930 --> 01:45:18.930]  You want something like this, you don't get stuff for free.
[01:45:18.930 --> 01:45:19.930]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[01:45:19.930 --> 01:45:20.930]  It's so good.
[01:45:20.930 --> 01:45:21.930]  In my view.
[01:45:21.930 --> 01:45:22.930]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[01:45:22.930 --> 01:45:23.930]  I ate five capulets of krill oil before I go to bed.
[01:45:23.930 --> 01:45:24.930]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[01:45:24.930 --> 01:45:46.930]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[01:45:46.930 --> 01:45:48.630]  So we don't make a big profit off of it.
[01:45:48.630 --> 01:45:52.570]  But, you know as I just obsess, because whatever the best is, we've got, I just can't lie to
[01:45:52.570 --> 01:45:53.570]  you.
[01:45:53.570 --> 01:45:54.570]  I just can't do it.
[01:45:54.570 --> 01:45:55.570]  That's why I'm here.
[01:45:55.570 --> 01:45:59.370]  This is a story on InfoWarStore.com.
[01:45:59.370 --> 01:46:02.030]  There is a war for the future happening right now.
[01:46:02.030 --> 01:46:06.910]  There is a war that will control my destiny, your destiny, our children's destinies.
[01:46:06.910 --> 01:46:09.330]  And that war is something that we can win.
[01:46:09.330 --> 01:46:10.910]  But it takes dedication.
[01:46:10.910 --> 01:46:12.270]  It takes commitment.
[01:46:12.270 --> 01:46:17.090]  That's why I ask listeners respectfully to go to InfoWarStore.com and buy great products
[01:46:17.090 --> 01:46:23.930]  that will enrich and empower your life while keeping us on air at the very same time.

[01:46:44.970 --> 01:46:48.130]  You've been watching for years, you've been listening for years, but you've never taken
[01:46:48.130 --> 01:46:50.370]  the step to go to InfoWarStore.
[01:46:50.370 --> 01:46:53.130]  These are great products that really work and are amazing.

[01:46:54.330 --> 01:46:58.930]  So again, please take action and go to InfoWarStore.com today and I thank you.
[01:47:07.620 --> 01:47:36.059]  We will take the planet back.
[01:47:36.059 --> 01:47:39.260]  We will journey to the stars and beyond.
[01:47:39.260 --> 01:47:45.099]  We will, with God's spirit, crush Satan's plan.
[01:47:45.099 --> 01:47:46.099]  This is real.
[01:47:46.099 --> 01:47:47.099]  This is happening now.
[01:47:47.099 --> 01:47:50.620]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live Wednesday transmission.
[01:47:50.620 --> 01:47:52.700]  All right.
[01:47:52.700 --> 01:47:58.860]  The Darien Gap, there's a bunch of documents coming out in video and the investigative
[01:47:58.860 --> 01:48:01.220]  journalist Mr. Yan has been down there.
[01:48:01.220 --> 01:48:04.460]  There's no internet there, so he's been sending information to Mike Adams.
[01:48:04.460 --> 01:48:06.860]  Mike Adams has the exclusive videos and more.
[01:48:06.860 --> 01:48:08.420]  In fact, make sure you get a list of those guys.
[01:48:08.420 --> 01:48:11.980]  We're going to be airing those next hour.
[01:48:11.980 --> 01:48:12.980]  This is huge.
[01:48:12.980 --> 01:48:15.700]  And it's the UN staging and organizing the invasion.
[01:48:15.700 --> 01:48:16.700]  We already know.
[01:48:16.700 --> 01:48:17.700]  We have the documents.
[01:48:17.700 --> 01:48:18.700]  We have even the news articles.
[01:48:18.700 --> 01:48:21.580]  But this is the video of it.
[01:48:21.580 --> 01:48:23.300]  And it's big.
[01:48:23.300 --> 01:48:27.820]  So we'll be breaking that down coming up in the next hour.
[01:48:27.820 --> 01:48:29.059]  All right.
[01:48:29.059 --> 01:48:31.620]  Let me get to the really serious news.
[01:48:31.620 --> 01:48:40.660]  And again, this is not about tooting my horn, but people say, oh, this group has the sources
[01:48:40.660 --> 01:48:44.059]  or that group has the sources.
[01:48:44.059 --> 01:48:50.980]  The government is a consortium of corporate tentacles and its operatives.
[01:48:50.980 --> 01:48:56.019]  And then within that strata, there are good people, there are bad people, there are asleep
[01:48:56.019 --> 01:48:57.460]  people.
[01:48:57.460 --> 01:49:00.220]  There's all sorts of folks.
[01:49:00.220 --> 01:49:02.660]  The good news is we're able to promote a message of freedom.
[01:49:02.660 --> 01:49:03.660]  We start to win.
[01:49:03.660 --> 01:49:11.620]  But if you remember last October, before last, like a year and a half ago.
[01:49:11.620 --> 01:49:16.580]  I went on air and I said the Russians are going to invade Ukraine in February.
[01:49:17.640 --> 01:49:19.640]  I said by late February.
[01:49:19.640 --> 01:49:26.640]  Well, that's because the Russians were already building up forces and the Russians were already in a battle with the U.S. forces.
[01:49:26.640 --> 01:49:35.640]  And I just know so many people in the military and know so many people that are involved that I didn't just get it from one source or two or three or five.
[01:49:35.640 --> 01:49:39.640]  They all said by the end of February we're told the Russians are going to invade.
[01:49:39.640 --> 01:49:45.640]  And I was talking to people very close to me who are retired Army who were just talking to their sons.
[01:49:45.640 --> 01:49:48.640]  I said by the end of February we're told the Russians are going to invade.
[01:49:46.270 --> 01:49:50.270]  Who are already there, and I'm going to leave it at that.
[01:49:51.840 --> 01:49:53.840]  And it wasn't like, oh, here's big Intel.
[01:49:53.840 --> 01:49:56.840]  It's like, we're really worried about Junior.
[01:49:56.840 --> 01:49:58.840]  This is my family.
[01:49:58.840 --> 01:50:03.840]  He's in Army Special Operations, and he's over there, and I'm like, where?
[01:50:03.840 --> 01:50:04.840]  Well, we can't say.
[01:50:04.840 --> 01:50:08.840]  He won't say, but it's dangerous.
[01:50:08.840 --> 01:50:10.840]  I'm like, Ukraine?
[01:50:10.840 --> 01:50:13.840]  I'm not going to say.
[01:50:13.840 --> 01:50:15.840]  He won't tell us, but yeah, it's Ukraine.
[01:50:15.840 --> 01:50:18.840]  He just, you know, there's casualties on both sides.
[01:50:18.840 --> 01:50:21.840]  They're fighting Russians.
[01:50:21.840 --> 01:50:27.840]  And then I talk to people I know in the military who have sons in the military,
[01:50:27.840 --> 01:50:30.840]  and they're like, yeah, where's your son over there?
[01:50:30.840 --> 01:50:33.840]  Army Special Operations leader.
[01:50:33.840 --> 01:50:35.840]  Oh, he's in Poland.
[01:50:35.840 --> 01:50:37.840]  I go, your son's not in Poland.
[01:50:37.840 --> 01:50:38.840]  He's in Ukraine.
[01:50:38.840 --> 01:50:40.840]  How do you know that?
[01:50:40.840 --> 01:50:44.840]  And then this guy was Special Forces, you know, whole nine yards,
[01:50:44.840 --> 01:50:47.840]  decades in the military, and he's like, how do you know that?
[01:50:47.840 --> 01:50:49.840]  I didn't tell you that.
[01:50:49.840 --> 01:50:51.840]  I'm like, so your son's in Ukraine?
[01:50:51.840 --> 01:50:53.840]  Pretty heavy battles?
[01:50:53.840 --> 01:50:55.840]  He's like, yeah, we're praying every day.
[01:50:55.840 --> 01:50:56.840]  It's bad.
[01:50:56.840 --> 01:50:58.840]  It's heavy.
[01:50:58.840 --> 01:51:01.840]  They're losing people.
[01:51:01.840 --> 01:51:06.840]  And so I just kept going, hey, so have they tried to hire you to go over there?
[01:51:06.840 --> 01:51:08.840]  Talking to another guy.
[01:51:08.840 --> 01:51:09.840]  Yeah, how do you know that?
[01:51:09.840 --> 01:51:11.840]  I was actually over there training them five years ago.
[01:51:11.840 --> 01:51:12.840]  Yeah.
[01:51:12.840 --> 01:51:13.840]  How the hell do you know all this?
[01:51:13.840 --> 01:51:15.840]  Because, I mean, I'm on the ground, folks.
[01:51:15.840 --> 01:51:17.840]  The best intelligence is on the ground.
[01:51:17.840 --> 01:51:20.840]  So I'm the only person that told you the Russians were going to invade,
[01:51:20.840 --> 01:51:25.840]  and I just got it because I'm immersed in military people.
[01:51:25.840 --> 01:51:27.840]  Their sons are over there killing Russians.
[01:51:27.840 --> 01:51:28.840]  They're getting killed.
[01:51:28.840 --> 01:51:31.840]  That's why there's helicopter accidents every week in Kentucky.
[01:51:31.840 --> 01:51:33.840]  Folks, those aren't helicopter accidents.
[01:51:33.840 --> 01:51:35.840]  Those are dead people.
[01:51:36.110 --> 01:51:42.630]  So, that's what's going on here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:51:42.630 --> 01:51:50.070]  I talked to dozens of people now that have been hired or are about to be hired or whose
[01:51:50.070 --> 01:51:53.910]  family was hired to go over there.
[01:51:53.910 --> 01:51:58.389]  And so, I don't need Cy Hirst to tell me a month ago that there's U.S. Special Forces.
[01:51:58.389 --> 01:52:00.309]  I don't need leaked documents to say it.
[01:52:00.309 --> 01:52:02.509]  I know what's going on.
[01:52:02.509 --> 01:52:12.849]  And I told you over and over and over again, there are thousands of U.S. troops under NATO,
[01:52:12.849 --> 01:52:16.150]  under security company auspices over there.
[01:52:16.150 --> 01:52:18.309]  We are in a direct war.
[01:52:18.309 --> 01:52:20.670]  Putin's not fighting the Ukrainians.
[01:52:20.670 --> 01:52:21.670]  They're the main group.
[01:52:21.670 --> 01:52:29.910]  Putin is fighting a coalition of more than 50 countries, and it's escalating, and it's
[01:52:29.910 --> 01:52:31.309]  leading a nuclear war.
[01:52:31.309 --> 01:52:33.349]  We're at war with Russia.
[01:52:33.349 --> 01:52:37.070]  But I'm not telling you that today because it's all over the news.
[01:52:37.070 --> 01:52:41.990]  AP, Reuters, everywhere, oh, U.S. government documents say U.S. Special Forces leading
[01:52:41.990 --> 01:52:45.830]  the attack in Ukraine.
[01:52:45.830 --> 01:52:46.830]  Ukraine war.
[01:52:46.830 --> 01:52:50.630]  Leaks show Western Special Forces on the ground, BBC.
[01:52:50.630 --> 01:52:51.630]  Breaking.
[01:52:51.630 --> 01:52:55.570]  Leaked U.S. defense documents show Western forces on the ground in Ukraine, and countries
[01:52:55.570 --> 01:52:59.230]  are named in the leaked document.
[01:52:59.230 --> 01:53:03.910]  Just in, classified doc leaks appears to be physical theft, not a cyber leak.
[01:53:03.910 --> 01:53:07.910]  Report, U.S.-coordinated failed Ukrainian assault on nuclear power plant.
[01:53:08.150 --> 01:53:17.269]  So our archivist, I just asked this morning, you already got it together, here's a small
[01:53:17.269 --> 01:53:23.150]  spattering of yours truly in the last year, 14, 15 months, telling you U.S. troops are
[01:53:23.150 --> 01:53:24.150]  fighting Russians.
[01:53:24.150 --> 01:53:25.150]  Here it is.
[01:53:25.150 --> 01:53:32.450]  Of course, there's massive amounts of weapons, and you know U.S. troops are in Ukraine.
[01:53:32.450 --> 01:53:33.450]  You know they're in Ukraine.
[01:53:33.450 --> 01:53:35.190]  You know they train Ukrainians.
[01:53:35.190 --> 01:53:37.389]  You know NATO forces are there.
[01:53:37.389 --> 01:53:43.190]  Australians are there, Brits are there, Germans are there, Dutch are there, and it is a full-on
[01:53:43.190 --> 01:53:44.190]  war.
[01:53:44.190 --> 01:53:47.250]  They've got a bunch of former British and U.S. generals all over the news, I got a stack
[01:53:47.250 --> 01:53:51.490]  of them right here saying, time to go ahead and just have war with Russia, time to go
[01:53:51.490 --> 01:53:55.610]  ahead and just send in the U.S. military, time to take the A-10s out of mothballs and
[01:53:55.610 --> 01:53:57.490]  just kill all the Russians.
[01:53:57.490 --> 01:54:01.809]  And you know the State Department and CIA and NATO are all there training these troops
[01:54:01.809 --> 01:54:02.809]  right now.
[01:54:02.809 --> 01:54:05.250]  It's been going on even before the Russians invaded.
[01:54:05.250 --> 01:54:10.110]  Americans are in charge of the war, says French journalist who returned from Ukraine.
[01:54:10.110 --> 01:54:16.710]  A French journalist who returned from Ukraine after arriving with volunteer fighters told
[01:54:16.710 --> 01:54:23.389]  broadcaster CNews that Americans are directly in charge of the war on the ground.
[01:54:23.389 --> 01:54:30.790]  The assertion was made by Le Figaro's senior international correspondent, Georges Malbrandt.
[01:54:30.790 --> 01:54:37.490]  It continues, Malbrandt said he had accompanied French volunteer fighters, two of whom had
[01:54:37.490 --> 01:54:39.089]  previously fought against ISIS.
[01:54:39.089 --> 01:54:46.170]  I had the surprise, and so did they, to discover that to be able to enter the Ukrainian army,
[01:54:46.170 --> 01:54:49.210]  well, it's the Americans who are in charge, he said.
[01:54:49.210 --> 01:54:53.889]  The video's posted right there on Infowars.com, you can watch it.
[01:54:53.889 --> 01:54:58.290]  Adding that he and the volunteers almost got, quote, arrested by the Americans who asserted
[01:54:58.290 --> 01:54:59.290]  they were in charge.
[01:54:59.290 --> 01:55:03.589]  The journalist then revealed that they were forced to sign a contract until the end of
[01:55:03.589 --> 01:55:04.589]  the war.
[01:55:04.589 --> 01:55:05.589]  And who is in charge?
[01:55:05.589 --> 01:55:06.589]  It's the Americans.
[01:55:06.589 --> 01:55:11.750]  I saw them own eyes, he said, adding, I thought I was with the international brigades and
[01:55:11.750 --> 01:55:14.230]  I found myself facing the Pentagon.
[01:55:14.230 --> 01:55:18.790]  And they're announcing that they're already sending in Polish and U.S. troops who are
[01:55:18.790 --> 01:55:23.150]  fighting, and I just talked to some military people this morning who just returned.
[01:55:23.150 --> 01:55:25.469]  They said it's full on like World War II.
[01:55:25.469 --> 01:55:29.030]  Just absolute destruction, dead bodies everywhere.
[01:55:29.769 --> 01:55:34.250]  Americans annihilating, Russians getting annihilated, just tank battles, I mean, this is full on
[01:55:34.250 --> 01:55:35.250]  war, folks.
[01:55:35.250 --> 01:55:39.610]  That's why you're not seeing a lot of it or hearing about it, it is just full on war.
[01:55:39.610 --> 01:55:41.570]  We're at war with Russia right now.
[01:55:41.570 --> 01:55:52.530]  Since October of last year, the U.S. troops have been directly, not just training Ukrainians
[01:55:52.530 --> 01:55:58.170]  in Ukraine, but also in Poland, with all sorts of high-tech class A weapons, but they've
[01:55:58.269 --> 01:56:11.269]  also been in the field commanding them and directing them and piloting short-range drones.
[01:56:11.269 --> 01:56:16.870]  But now, because the losses on the U.S. side are starting to become quite large, they're
[01:56:16.870 --> 01:56:19.870]  going to go ahead and admit that the U.S. is officially at war with Russia.
[01:56:19.870 --> 01:56:32.170]  Maybe we should get the clip where I told you in October, a year and a half ago, that
[01:56:32.170 --> 01:56:35.170]  the war would start in February.
[01:56:35.170 --> 01:56:39.410]  The point is, I'm not blowing smoke up your rear ends here, okay?
[01:56:39.410 --> 01:56:45.009]  So when I tell you this is leading to nuclear war, it's guaranteed on the path we're on.
[01:56:45.009 --> 01:56:46.969]  So yeah, we have crazy people running tanks.
[01:56:46.969 --> 01:56:47.969]  Okay.
[01:56:48.070 --> 01:56:50.070]  We're going to go to break.
[01:56:50.070 --> 01:56:51.070]  We're going to go to Mike Adams.
[01:56:51.070 --> 01:56:55.750]  We're going to go to the exclusive footage from the Darien Gap in Central and South America
[01:56:55.750 --> 01:56:56.750]  and the whole U.N. invasion.
[01:56:56.750 --> 01:57:04.790]  In fact, guys, go ahead and print the old articles, Soros, AP, NBC funding $1,000, $2,000
[01:57:04.790 --> 01:57:09.269]  debit cards for illegals to come in through the Darien Gap.
[01:57:09.269 --> 01:57:12.030]  Everybody knows about this, but nobody goes down there.
[01:57:12.030 --> 01:57:13.549]  Well, we have the footage.
[01:57:13.549 --> 01:57:14.670]  We have all that.
[01:57:14.670 --> 01:57:16.690]  It's coming up next hour.
[01:57:16.670 --> 01:57:23.230]  With Mr. Yan and Mr. Adams.
[01:57:23.230 --> 01:57:25.630]  Please remember, we're listener supported.
[01:57:25.630 --> 01:57:28.270]  We have the Alex Jones for President shirt, it's a fun shirt.
[01:57:28.270 --> 01:57:30.470]  We have the Trump mugshot shirt.
[01:57:30.470 --> 01:57:32.510]  We have the Infowars products.
[01:57:32.510 --> 01:57:35.750]  We have a TurboForce back in stock, sold out for eight months.
[01:57:35.750 --> 01:57:39.230]  That's powerful long-term energy, you're going to get 10-hour clean energy.
[01:57:39.230 --> 01:57:40.230]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:57:40.230 --> 01:57:45.230]  We also have the 1776 isosterone boost and Pain MD, they're amazing.
[01:57:46.440 --> 01:57:57.160]  If Alex Jones runs for president in the Republican Party, he has a chance of winning.
[01:57:57.160 --> 01:58:04.000]  If you just tuned in, you may be noticing I'm wearing an Alex Jones for president 2024
[01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:05.000]  shirt.
[01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:08.040]  I am not seriously planning to run for president.
[01:58:08.040 --> 01:58:12.120]  This is an idea of the crew had to have a triggering shirt, kind of next level Alex
[01:58:12.120 --> 01:58:13.120]  Jones was right.
[01:58:13.120 --> 01:58:17.639]  There's Infowars.com in the back, Alex Jones for president 2024 on the front.
[01:58:17.639 --> 01:58:18.639]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[01:58:18.639 --> 01:58:21.280]  It's made out of really nice fabric, it's high quality.
[01:58:21.280 --> 01:58:24.719]  And it is a exclusive shirt to Infowars.com.
[01:58:24.719 --> 01:58:26.559]  And when the shirts are gone, they're gone.
[01:58:26.559 --> 01:58:32.280]  We're doing one run of Alex Jones for president 2024 shirts.
[01:58:32.280 --> 01:58:35.960]  And we'll have a historic memento, be able to spread the word, meet a lot of like minded
[01:58:35.960 --> 01:58:36.960]  people.
[01:58:36.960 --> 01:58:39.320]  And you'll be able to keep us on the air.
[01:58:39.320 --> 01:58:40.320]  No way.
[01:58:40.320 --> 01:58:41.320]  No way.
[01:58:41.320 --> 01:58:42.320]  That's a bridge too far.
[01:58:42.519 --> 01:58:43.799]  No, it can't be.
[01:58:43.799 --> 01:58:49.519]  And I said on national television that he was going to win at Infowars.com.
[01:58:49.519 --> 01:58:54.960]  Hydrofluorosilicic acid is the third most deadly acid on earth.
[01:58:54.960 --> 01:58:57.660]  And they've got our children drinking that.
[01:58:57.660 --> 01:59:03.400]  This is a psychotic death cult, period, case closed, out to get you and your family.
[01:59:03.400 --> 01:59:08.400]  We sell the Alexa pure breeze made by the My Patriot Supply Ready Hour group.
[01:59:08.400 --> 01:59:11.679]  It's been around about 15 years, became the biggest company in the last six.
[01:59:12.040 --> 01:59:16.040]  They went out, hired engineers, reverse engineered the fancy best water filter system out there
[01:59:16.040 --> 01:59:17.360]  that sells for twice the price.
[01:59:17.360 --> 01:59:21.240]  And they made it as good in all the studies.
[01:59:21.240 --> 01:59:24.919]  It reduces things to non detectable levels, thousands of chemicals, but you can go pay
[01:59:24.919 --> 01:59:25.919]  two or three times.
[01:59:25.919 --> 01:59:28.799]  There's four or five other filters out there that are just as good.
[01:59:28.799 --> 01:59:33.160]  We sell the very best highest grade water filtration system for half the price of leading
[01:59:33.160 --> 01:59:34.160]  competitor.
[01:59:34.160 --> 01:59:39.440]  And the media says we're bad and a cult for telling you you should filter your water.
[01:59:39.440 --> 01:59:41.200]  You should also filter your shower water.
[01:59:41.719 --> 01:59:42.719]  It's another way you absorb this crap.
[01:59:42.719 --> 01:59:44.200]  But I'm done talking about that.
[01:59:44.200 --> 01:59:48.280]  The point is you get the filters at Infowarsstore.com, they're discounted right now, finally back
[01:59:48.280 --> 01:59:49.280]  in stock.
[01:59:52.280 --> 01:59:56.280]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:59:56.360 --> 02:00:15.360]  The United States has been at war with Russia for nine years, Ukraine spilled over now and
[02:00:15.360 --> 02:00:17.360]  threatens to destroy the planet.
[02:00:17.360 --> 02:00:22.000]  Mike Adams will break down exclusive information on the U.N. invasion launched out of Central
[02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.919]  and South America coming up next segment.
[02:00:24.919 --> 02:00:28.679]  But as promised, I want to hear more of the powerful interview last night, 30 minutes
[02:00:28.679 --> 02:00:29.679]  long.
[02:00:29.679 --> 02:00:30.679]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[02:00:30.679 --> 02:00:32.919]  President Trump and the great Carlson.
[02:00:32.919 --> 02:00:33.919]  Here's more of that report.
[02:00:33.919 --> 02:00:35.839]  I would have been out faster than them.
[02:00:35.839 --> 02:00:37.519]  We would have had all the equipment.
[02:00:37.519 --> 02:00:39.719]  We would have had the American citizens.
[02:00:39.719 --> 02:00:40.839]  We left hostages.
[02:00:40.839 --> 02:00:45.280]  We left Americans behind many, I think many more than you think.
[02:00:45.280 --> 02:00:47.440]  And we had 13 soldiers killed.
[02:00:47.440 --> 02:00:53.240]  And nobody ever mentions the fact that we had many maimed so badly, no arms, no legs.
[02:00:53.559 --> 02:00:56.080]  Their face was obliterated.
[02:00:56.080 --> 02:00:57.679]  This is the way this guy got out.
[02:00:57.679 --> 02:00:59.400]  We would have gotten out with dignity and strength.
[02:00:59.400 --> 02:01:00.400]  We were going to.
[02:01:00.400 --> 02:01:04.480]  But I was taking 100 percent of I said, I want every nail.
[02:01:04.480 --> 02:01:06.360]  I want every screw.
[02:01:06.360 --> 02:01:07.360]  I want the tents.
[02:01:07.360 --> 02:01:09.679]  They said, sir, the tents are very hard to take out.
[02:01:09.679 --> 02:01:11.200]  I said, I want the tents.
[02:01:11.200 --> 02:01:12.360]  I want the tanks.
[02:01:12.360 --> 02:01:13.360]  I want the planes.
[02:01:13.360 --> 02:01:14.799]  I want everything.
[02:01:14.799 --> 02:01:17.000]  And a couple of them fought me on it like Millie.
[02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:20.400]  He said, sir, I think it's cheaper to leave the equipment behind.
[02:01:20.400 --> 02:01:23.280]  I said, let me ask you, we have a plane that cost 100 million dollars.
[02:01:23.280 --> 02:01:24.280]  It's sitting there.
[02:01:24.280 --> 02:01:26.280]  All it needs is a tank of gas.
[02:01:26.280 --> 02:01:27.280]  Right.
[02:01:27.280 --> 02:01:28.719]  Give me a little jet fuel.
[02:01:28.719 --> 02:01:33.580]  We'll fly it to Pakistan or any place else, or we'll fly it directly home.
[02:01:33.580 --> 02:01:36.040]  You say it's cheaper to leave 100 million dollar plan.
[02:01:36.040 --> 02:01:37.040]  Sure.
[02:01:37.040 --> 02:01:38.919]  I think overall it's cheaper.
[02:01:38.919 --> 02:01:40.879]  These are idiots we're dealing with.
[02:01:40.879 --> 02:01:43.839]  They left eighty five billion dollars worth of equipment.
[02:01:43.839 --> 02:01:47.839]  They left our American citizens behind and they move the military at first.
[02:01:47.839 --> 02:01:49.879]  No, you move the military at last.
[02:01:49.879 --> 02:01:52.040]  I did a little skit with a five year old kid.
[02:01:52.040 --> 02:01:54.040]  I said, let me ask you, here's the situation.
[02:01:54.040 --> 02:01:55.400]  I explained the situation.
[02:01:55.400 --> 02:02:00.559]  I said, would you take the military out first or would you take it out last?
[02:02:00.559 --> 02:02:04.559]  I take it out last five year old.
[02:02:04.559 --> 02:02:08.360]  But they took the military out first and they were afraid of our military.
[02:02:08.360 --> 02:02:10.559]  When I was there, they were afraid.
[02:02:10.559 --> 02:02:15.000]  We didn't have one soldier killed in 18 months.
[02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.599]  Not one soldier was killed in 18 months.
[02:02:17.599 --> 02:02:20.200]  And then we got out like we surrendered.
[02:02:20.200 --> 02:02:24.160]  I think it was the single most embarrassing day in the history of our country.
[02:02:24.160 --> 02:02:25.160]  It was totally their fault.
[02:02:25.160 --> 02:02:30.080]  They didn't go by anything because, you know, we had a system of getting out.
[02:02:30.080 --> 02:02:34.799]  But if the Taliban in particular, the Taliban, because that's where the action was.
[02:02:34.799 --> 02:02:35.799]  Right.
[02:02:35.799 --> 02:02:38.759]  When I called Abdul, the press went crazy.
[02:02:38.759 --> 02:02:40.400]  The fake news went crazy.
[02:02:40.400 --> 02:02:41.879]  Why did he call an enemy?
[02:02:41.879 --> 02:02:44.080]  I said, well, it's Jesse James.
[02:02:44.080 --> 02:02:45.799]  I used to ask him, why did he rob banks?
[02:02:45.799 --> 02:02:47.799]  He said, that's where the money is.
[02:02:47.799 --> 02:02:49.759]  Why did I call the head of the Taliban?
[02:02:49.759 --> 02:02:52.559]  Because that's where the killing was.
[02:02:52.559 --> 02:02:53.559]  And he's there now.
[02:02:53.559 --> 02:02:54.559]  Abdul.
[02:02:54.559 --> 02:02:55.559]  I'm sure he likes me.
[02:02:55.559 --> 02:02:56.559]  Call me.
[02:02:56.559 --> 02:02:57.559]  Your Excellency.
[02:02:57.559 --> 02:02:58.559]  I don't know if he calls Biden.
[02:02:58.559 --> 02:02:59.559]  Your Excellency.
[02:02:59.559 --> 02:03:00.559]  Probably.
[02:03:00.559 --> 02:03:02.280]  I mean, you know, they're one of the largest arms dealers now in the world.
[02:03:02.280 --> 02:03:05.599]  They're selling the eighty five billion dollars worth of because they only need five percent
[02:03:05.599 --> 02:03:06.599]  of it.
[02:03:06.599 --> 02:03:07.920]  Of course, they're selling the equipment.
[02:03:07.920 --> 02:03:08.920]  They're one of the largest.
[02:03:08.920 --> 02:03:15.679]  I think second arms deals are brand new helicopters, brand new airplanes, brand new tanks.
[02:03:16.559 --> 02:03:18.959]  Unbelievable what we left behind.
[02:03:18.959 --> 02:03:22.040]  We ran and there was no reason to.
[02:03:22.040 --> 02:03:23.040]  I had them.
[02:03:23.040 --> 02:03:25.639]  I could have stayed there for five years if I wanted to.
[02:03:25.639 --> 02:03:26.639]  I want out.
[02:03:26.639 --> 02:03:28.480]  Twenty one years was enough.
[02:03:28.480 --> 02:03:29.480]  I wanted out.
[02:03:29.480 --> 02:03:32.000]  We should have been there in the first place.
[02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:36.080]  But when I see what happens, when I see the level of stupidity and because of that, it's
[02:03:36.080 --> 02:03:38.440]  all a big web because of that.
[02:03:38.440 --> 02:03:43.120]  I think Putin, who would have never gone into Ukraine when I was there, would have never
[02:03:43.120 --> 02:03:48.959]  I talked to him about it often would have never, ever done that when he saw that I wasn't
[02:03:48.959 --> 02:03:49.959]  there.
[02:03:49.959 --> 02:03:53.040]  And he saw these fools, these stupid people.
[02:03:53.040 --> 02:03:57.759]  And think of that the way they left Afghanistan and nobody was fired.
[02:03:57.759 --> 02:04:01.639]  I fired a lot of people because if they didn't do a good job at farming, I asked you, talk
[02:04:01.639 --> 02:04:03.120]  to Putin about Ukraine.
[02:04:03.120 --> 02:04:04.559]  What did you say to him?
[02:04:04.559 --> 02:04:06.879]  I could see that he loved it.
[02:04:06.879 --> 02:04:08.879]  And I said he loved Ukraine.
[02:04:08.879 --> 02:04:12.360]  He considers it to be a part of Russia.
[02:04:12.480 --> 02:04:14.280]  Yeah, I said this is important.
[02:04:14.280 --> 02:04:15.280]  We'll get to more of this.
[02:04:15.280 --> 02:04:17.040]  I'm a host a little bit into the fourth hour.
[02:04:17.040 --> 02:04:18.040]  We'll get to more of this.
[02:04:18.040 --> 02:04:20.040]  But you see where they missed the point.
[02:04:20.040 --> 02:04:22.200]  Trump's smart, but he doesn't get it.
[02:04:22.200 --> 02:04:25.160]  There's incompetency by design.
[02:04:25.160 --> 02:04:28.879]  The globalists wanted to give all those weapons over because those are weapons we lose and
[02:04:28.879 --> 02:04:30.879]  they can spend more money.
[02:04:30.879 --> 02:04:32.599]  But it's also to build the Taliban back up.
[02:04:32.599 --> 02:04:34.719]  You have to go back in there later.
[02:04:34.719 --> 02:04:39.120]  So he's like, they're idiots to fly a tank out for fifty thousand dollars.
[02:04:39.120 --> 02:04:40.120]  It's worth five million.
[02:04:40.120 --> 02:04:41.719]  Why are you doing this?
[02:04:41.719 --> 02:04:43.280]  Because it was a plan.
[02:04:43.280 --> 02:04:49.400]  And of course, they pulled out of Afghanistan to look weak, to get Putin to invade.
[02:04:49.400 --> 02:04:51.559]  You know, the CIA leaked these new documents.
[02:04:51.559 --> 02:04:52.559]  You know, that's all a bunch of crap.
[02:04:52.559 --> 02:04:53.559]  We'll be right back.
[02:04:53.559 --> 02:04:54.559]  Stay with us.
[02:04:54.559 --> 02:05:04.240]  They decided to not perp walking, not put him in handcuffs, not do a mugshot because
[02:05:04.240 --> 02:05:05.759]  they knew that that would help Trump.
[02:05:05.759 --> 02:05:08.040]  Didn't they know this would backfire?
[02:05:08.040 --> 02:05:09.519]  We were waiting for the mugshot.
[02:05:09.519 --> 02:05:10.759]  We learned today they wouldn't have it.
[02:05:10.759 --> 02:05:17.080]  So we've made our own and it says political prisoner with an image of President Trump.
[02:05:17.080 --> 02:05:19.519]  The shirt is being printed now in Texas.
[02:05:19.519 --> 02:05:22.080]  It will be shipping out to you in one week.
[02:05:22.080 --> 02:05:28.280]  Political prisoner with Trump on the front there in a mugshot jail background.
[02:05:28.280 --> 02:05:29.280]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[02:05:29.280 --> 02:05:33.440]  It says InfoWars.com on the back of the shirt.
[02:05:33.440 --> 02:05:34.759]  We also have Alex Jones for president.
[02:05:34.759 --> 02:05:36.080]  No, I'm not running for president.
[02:05:36.080 --> 02:05:38.559]  It's a really nice navy blue, high quality shirt.
[02:05:38.559 --> 02:05:39.559]  Red, white and blue.
[02:05:39.559 --> 02:05:40.559]  Alex Jones for president.
[02:05:40.559 --> 02:05:41.559]  Twenty twenty four.
[02:05:41.559 --> 02:05:43.920]  It's a fun conversational piece and a limited edition shirt.
[02:05:43.920 --> 02:05:45.719]  Great way to fund the operation.
[02:05:45.719 --> 02:05:54.360]  So get your Alex Jones for president and Trump mugshot shirts at InfoWars.com or by calling
[02:05:54.360 --> 02:06:06.519]  toll free triple eight two five three three one three nine from the front lines of the
[02:06:07.519 --> 02:06:08.519]  Information War.
[02:06:08.519 --> 02:06:09.519]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:09.519 --> 02:06:10.519]  All right.
[02:06:10.519 --> 02:06:11.519]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here back live.
[02:06:11.519 --> 02:06:12.519]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:06:12.519 --> 02:06:13.519]  We're into the third hour today.
[02:06:13.519 --> 02:06:14.519]  All right.
[02:06:14.519 --> 02:06:30.879]  The great Michael Young, famous special forces officer, author, researcher, world traveler
[02:06:30.879 --> 02:06:35.360]  is in the Darien Gap right there on the border of Central and South America.
[02:06:35.360 --> 02:06:38.160]  He's over 50 miles of a deathtrap.
[02:06:38.160 --> 02:06:42.799]  The U.N. ships the people in from Africa, ships them in from the Middle East, ships
[02:06:42.799 --> 02:06:45.440]  them in from Asia.
[02:06:45.440 --> 02:06:50.759]  And then sends them through the Darien Gap at giant refugee centers where they then organize
[02:06:50.759 --> 02:06:56.160]  them in Panama, send them up to Guatemala and then into Mexico.
[02:06:56.160 --> 02:07:00.879]  And Michael Young's been working with Jordan Peterson and he's also been working with Mike
[02:07:00.879 --> 02:07:04.879]  Adams teaming up with two great, really smart people.
[02:07:05.400 --> 02:07:11.160]  And yeah, I have the stack of articles right here of Reuters and AP four or five years
[02:07:11.160 --> 02:07:17.599]  ago where George Soros gives billions of dollars of U.S. aid from the State Department.
[02:07:17.599 --> 02:07:18.599]  He doesn't give the money.
[02:07:18.599 --> 02:07:20.000]  It's like Bill Gates doesn't give any money away.
[02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:21.759]  He gets government money and does it.
[02:07:21.759 --> 02:07:24.240]  It's all tax exempt.
[02:07:24.240 --> 02:07:30.400]  And they give $5,000 debit cards on average people in Africa to get on a plane and fly
[02:07:30.400 --> 02:07:34.759]  to South America because the other countries won't let them do it.
[02:07:35.639 --> 02:07:40.799]  And then they go across the Darien Gap into Central America and they get raped.
[02:07:40.799 --> 02:07:45.639]  You saw the numbers in a State Department report six, seven years ago, 80 percent of
[02:07:45.639 --> 02:07:50.360]  girls and women are raped on their way.
[02:07:50.360 --> 02:07:51.360]  Eighty percent.
[02:07:51.360 --> 02:07:53.679]  Where are the feminists on that?
[02:07:53.679 --> 02:07:57.679]  And then once they get there, just like they did the last 15 years in Europe, they organized
[02:07:57.679 --> 02:07:58.719]  to bring across the border.
[02:07:58.719 --> 02:08:01.240]  And Biden said, if I get elected, immediately arrest the border.
[02:08:01.240 --> 02:08:04.519]  So let me show you some of these headlines and Mike Adams can explain where the Darien
[02:08:04.519 --> 02:08:08.240]  Gap is, what Michael Yan is getting and more.
[02:08:08.240 --> 02:08:15.440]  This is UPI, United Press International, George Soros MasterCard Partners on Refugee Aid Delivery.
[02:08:15.440 --> 02:08:21.639]  Gives them debit cards, $5,000 on average to get to South America, $2,000 to get into
[02:08:21.639 --> 02:08:27.920]  Mexico and another $2,000, no name on the card, just a blank debit card to get into
[02:08:27.920 --> 02:08:28.920]  the U.S.
[02:08:28.920 --> 02:08:31.839]  And then they become a voter in their group they control.
[02:08:32.160 --> 02:08:37.160]  OK, this was 2017 from a member of the ADL says it's not true.
[02:08:37.160 --> 02:08:40.280]  They mentioned the claim that there's debit cards and said anyone saying this should be
[02:08:40.280 --> 02:08:42.280]  arrested, including myself.
[02:08:42.280 --> 02:08:43.679]  There's no replacement migration.
[02:08:43.679 --> 02:08:44.679]  This does not exist, though.
[02:08:44.679 --> 02:08:45.679]  It's in UPI.
[02:08:45.679 --> 02:08:47.080]  Well, they tell you it's good.
[02:08:47.080 --> 02:08:48.160]  You can report on it.
[02:08:48.160 --> 02:08:50.160]  When you say it's bad, it doesn't exist.
[02:08:50.160 --> 02:08:55.360]  Report World Tribune, you and giving debit cards to U.S. bound migrants and that we got
[02:08:55.360 --> 02:08:56.360]  videos of it.
[02:08:56.360 --> 02:08:57.360]  We'll show you.
[02:08:57.360 --> 02:08:58.360]  It's all right there.
[02:08:58.360 --> 02:09:03.879]  World Soros MasterCard Reuters partner to aid migrant refugees.
[02:09:03.879 --> 02:09:07.959]  This is five years ago again.
[02:09:07.959 --> 02:09:11.200]  Watch U.N. debit cards being given to U.S. bound migrants.
[02:09:11.200 --> 02:09:14.240]  News wars dot com.
[02:09:14.240 --> 02:09:16.799]  U.N. debit cards provide safety net during COVID-19.
[02:09:16.799 --> 02:09:17.799]  U.N. dot org.
[02:09:17.799 --> 02:09:18.799]  That's the U.N.
[02:09:18.799 --> 02:09:24.400]  But of course, the migrants don't take the shot because the U.N. won't sign on the liability
[02:09:24.400 --> 02:09:28.799]  they got our governments to sign on to in secret agreements in case the shot hurts them.
[02:09:28.799 --> 02:09:32.679]  So the U.N. won't sign on to give the shots to them.
[02:09:32.679 --> 02:09:33.679]  They're exempt.
[02:09:33.679 --> 02:09:34.679]  But you're not.
[02:09:34.679 --> 02:09:36.400]  Isn't that a big enchilada?
[02:09:36.400 --> 02:09:39.400]  There's so many facets.
[02:09:39.400 --> 02:09:45.040]  Soros pledges to invest 500 million in migrant refugee debit cards.
[02:09:45.040 --> 02:09:48.839]  Hungry to criminalize migrant helpers would stop Soros legislation.
[02:09:48.839 --> 02:09:50.679]  So this is the reality.
[02:09:50.679 --> 02:09:56.480]  Billionaire Soros outlines plan to save Europe 2018 shipping tens of millions in.
[02:09:56.480 --> 02:09:58.440]  It's him.
[02:09:58.440 --> 02:10:04.959]  OK, so that's the reality.
[02:10:04.959 --> 02:10:09.759]  That's all admitted.
[02:10:09.759 --> 02:10:15.519]  And just like they set up these things on the border of Macedonia and other areas to
[02:10:15.519 --> 02:10:21.599]  invade Europe, the same guy runs the nonprofit in Texas, which is the main invasion point
[02:10:21.599 --> 02:10:22.599]  now.
[02:10:22.599 --> 02:10:23.599]  We're down there years ago.
[02:10:23.599 --> 02:10:25.040]  We showed you the video.
[02:10:25.040 --> 02:10:26.040]  It's billions.
[02:10:26.040 --> 02:10:30.000]  And when you see it, it's literal purple and green haired liberals giving orders to the
[02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:31.000]  Border Patrol.
[02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:34.320]  The Border Patrol, you say, oh, Abbott just put troops on the border.
[02:10:34.320 --> 02:10:36.080]  They just turn the illegals over.
[02:10:36.080 --> 02:10:40.080]  They're given a debit card and sent into the U.S. to work in a sweatshop and pay after
[02:10:40.080 --> 02:10:41.440]  my Democratic Party to be laundered.
[02:10:42.710 --> 02:10:48.430]  And there's all the big breaking news about billions of dollars to these
[02:10:48.430 --> 02:10:52.150]  Democrat front groups and they go to the donor's house. I never gave thousands of
[02:10:52.150 --> 02:10:55.190]  donations. I didn't give one donation to whoever. This whole way like I don't I
[02:10:55.190 --> 02:10:58.630]  didn't give a donation. Well it says you gave 1,500 donations last six years and
[02:10:58.630 --> 02:11:03.670]  they take that money and launder it. This is a criminal organization. The
[02:11:03.670 --> 02:11:06.750]  Justice Department is running it. They're not just aware of it. They're running it.
[02:11:06.750 --> 02:11:10.830]  So I'm gonna shut up now. That's the background on this. Mike Adams has been
[02:11:10.830 --> 02:11:15.990]  working with the great investigative reporter, famous Special Forces operator
[02:11:15.990 --> 02:11:23.830]  Mr. Yon, Michael Yon, to break all this down ladies and gentlemen. So this is a
[02:11:23.830 --> 02:11:28.710]  big deal. The footage is up on Infowars.com. It's at naturalnews.com. It's
[02:11:28.710 --> 02:11:33.990]  on Michael Yon's website as well. We'll put on screen the URL for people to find
[02:11:33.990 --> 02:11:37.590]  it. This is incredible investigative journalism. Everybody should be doing
[02:11:37.590 --> 02:11:43.590]  this. Mike Adams. Hi Alex and I was just texting with Michael Yon. He's going to
[02:11:43.590 --> 02:11:47.870]  another camp today. We're gonna get some additional video of a far worse camp he
[02:11:47.870 --> 02:11:52.510]  says later this afternoon. I was uploading that footage that you you can
[02:11:52.510 --> 02:11:55.430]  roll that footage anytime. I was uploading that I think 2 in the morning
[02:11:55.430 --> 02:11:59.150]  by the way working on this. But we're gonna get Michael Yon in studio with you
[02:11:59.150 --> 02:12:02.870]  there Alex as soon as he comes back into the States. He wants to get on with you.
[02:12:02.870 --> 02:12:08.030]  He's got additional photographs, additional bombshell footage and you
[02:12:08.030 --> 02:12:11.750]  know firsthand accounts of what's going on there. So you know the United Nations
[02:12:11.750 --> 02:12:16.670]  gives these women these rape kits and there's there's a photo that I actually
[02:12:16.670 --> 02:12:22.470]  sent your producers about the rape kits. It's the IOM rape kits because there's
[02:12:22.470 --> 02:12:25.710]  so many rapes that go on. The United States goes down there and basically
[02:12:25.710 --> 02:12:30.470]  advertises for these migrants. They'll come on in, come to America and then yeah
[02:12:30.470 --> 02:12:34.910]  there it is the the OIM. It's called OIM or IOM depending on whether it's in
[02:12:34.910 --> 02:12:38.950]  Espanol or English by the way. But that's a United Nations funded rape kit
[02:12:38.950 --> 02:12:43.070]  and there's actually a full video of that woman who's Spanish-speaking that
[02:12:43.070 --> 02:12:47.150]  we'll we'll have for you later where she's describing that that's a rape kit.
[02:12:47.150 --> 02:12:53.070]  And Michael Yon was describing how the the military men there in Panama who are
[02:12:53.070 --> 02:12:57.670]  who are good men. They're trying to protect lives. They had to hunt down these
[02:12:57.670 --> 02:13:03.150]  Colombian drug gang people who were chasing women through the jungles and
[02:13:03.150 --> 02:13:07.230]  raping them and they actually tracked them down. There was a firefight and they
[02:13:07.230 --> 02:13:10.670]  shot the rapists which you know of course we all cheered at that you know
[02:13:10.670 --> 02:13:15.430]  those rapists should be shot. But that's the kind of torture and hell that these
[02:13:15.430 --> 02:13:18.910]  women and families are being put through because of the United Nations. And again what's wrong with these
[02:13:18.910 --> 02:13:22.110]  people? There's the Huffington Post headline ten years ago. The State
[02:13:22.110 --> 02:13:26.110]  Department admits 80% of women raped traveling from Mexico to the US. Who are
[02:13:26.110 --> 02:13:29.830]  these people? Don't they have mothers? Don't they have daughters? Don't they
[02:13:29.830 --> 02:13:35.910]  have grandmothers? Who rapes women? What has happened? Well it's it's this
[02:13:35.910 --> 02:13:41.830]  crazy mixed bag. There was in the video that I posted I was able to talk to a
[02:13:41.830 --> 02:13:46.470]  young Chinese couple in Mandarin and I confirmed they're from China and they're
[02:13:46.470 --> 02:13:50.630]  on their way to the United States. I'm like why are they in the Darien Gap in
[02:13:50.630 --> 02:13:55.270]  Panama if they're from China and they're going to America? But you know because I
[02:13:55.270 --> 02:13:58.470]  speak enough Chinese I was able to confirm that with them. They look like a
[02:13:58.470 --> 02:14:01.830]  perfectly nice couple. They might be a Christian couple Alex. They might make
[02:14:01.830 --> 02:14:05.790]  great Americans but the problem is there's no sorting these people out of
[02:14:05.790 --> 02:14:10.150]  the criminals versus the good people who really want to contribute to America. You
[02:14:10.150 --> 02:14:16.710]  know what I'm saying? This is footage of them killing the rapists. Yeah yeah there we go.
[02:14:16.710 --> 02:14:20.470]  These firefights are happening on a regular basis down there and the
[02:14:20.470 --> 02:14:23.510]  Panamanian military guys they're trying to do a good job. They're trying to
[02:14:23.510 --> 02:14:26.870]  protect lives but this flood is happening because of the United Nations
[02:14:26.870 --> 02:14:31.350]  Homeland Security and the Biden administration. Yeah they're drinking out of a firehose.
[02:14:31.350 --> 02:14:36.390]  Absolutely they they can't stop it either. This this is a humanitarian crisis that
[02:14:36.390 --> 02:14:41.710]  has been caused by the Biden regime and the United Nations trying to flood the
[02:14:41.710 --> 02:14:46.350]  United States with illegals so that Biden can declare them to be citizens
[02:14:46.350 --> 02:14:51.630]  before the 2024 election so that they can override the voting system with the
[02:14:51.630 --> 02:14:55.270]  this new flood of illegals that they're shoving in no matter if they're
[02:14:55.270 --> 02:14:59.870]  criminals or not. That's their plan to try to defeat Trump by the way in 2024.
[02:14:59.870 --> 02:15:04.350]  If Trump is the nominee they're gonna defeat him in the ballot box by just
[02:15:04.350 --> 02:15:07.670]  having a flood of millions of new voters and that's why there's this mad
[02:15:07.670 --> 02:15:11.390]  rush across the border right now of criminals and everybody they can find
[02:15:11.390 --> 02:15:15.270]  from around the world. It's incredible. Tell us what you're gonna break down when
[02:15:15.270 --> 02:15:18.910]  we come up. I've got so much to cover. Well they're people from different
[02:15:18.910 --> 02:15:22.470]  nations so in in that video from Michael Yan I want to give him full
[02:15:22.470 --> 02:15:28.550]  credit michaelyan.locals.com his last name is spelled Y-O-N by the way we he
[02:15:28.550 --> 02:15:33.250]  identified people from Haiti, Venezuela, the Middle East, China and many South
[02:15:33.250 --> 02:15:39.030]  American countries so this is a staging location for these migrants from around
[02:15:39.030 --> 02:15:43.150]  the world to then rush into the United States and occupy the USA. That's what
[02:15:43.150 --> 02:15:46.310]  it's about. We're gonna cover that more. And it's replacement migration which is
[02:15:46.310 --> 02:15:51.710]  an official UN document but Sasa Karab, Sasa whatever Barron's name is is
[02:15:51.710 --> 02:15:55.390]  actually arrested for talking about it. What a monster. We'll be right back as
[02:15:55.390 --> 02:15:58.070]  a human traffickers.
[02:15:58.070 --> 02:16:06.590]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had. I don't think anybody can deny it and it is because of
[02:16:06.590 --> 02:16:10.430]  listeners and viewers supporting us. When we talk about the crew at InfoWars,
[02:16:10.430 --> 02:16:15.670]  people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the
[02:16:15.670 --> 02:16:19.990]  MVPs in this fight. And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the
[02:16:19.990 --> 02:16:25.070]  hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just
[02:16:25.070 --> 02:16:28.990]  incredible. So for myself, the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past
[02:16:28.990 --> 02:16:34.030]  support. I want to encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on
[02:16:34.030 --> 02:16:37.790]  air if you do not support us. I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us
[02:16:37.790 --> 02:16:41.430]  and that's wonderful, keep doing it but most viewers and listeners never go to
[02:16:41.430 --> 02:16:45.190]  InfoWarsStore.com and you never buy great products that enrich and empower
[02:16:45.190 --> 02:16:49.430]  your life all at the same time keep us on air. I know that less than 1% of our
[02:16:49.430 --> 02:16:53.590]  listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsStore.com. If just 1% more of you
[02:16:53.590 --> 02:16:57.350]  took action and went to InfoWarsStore.com, our funding problems will be over. Please
[02:16:57.350 --> 02:17:00.350]  take action now. Every time I talk to you, you're either like on the border
[02:17:00.350 --> 02:17:04.750]  exposing the cartels and like coming under fire or you're on the streets of
[02:17:04.750 --> 02:17:07.990]  some American city hanging out with drug addicts and criminals and now you've
[02:17:07.990 --> 02:17:11.630]  gone to ground zero of a massive chemical spill. Are you addicted to the
[02:17:11.630 --> 02:17:15.110]  dangerous Savannah? Have you ever considered that for a second? No, I'm
[02:17:15.110 --> 02:17:19.310]  addicted to helping my fellow Americans. I'm addicted to spreading the truth and
[02:17:19.310 --> 02:17:22.710]  again I you know I have InfoWars to thank for that. Looking back on the day
[02:17:22.710 --> 02:17:27.430]  I was able to ask President Donald Trump two questions. I was so grateful because
[02:17:27.430 --> 02:17:31.430]  you know I truly was classically trained under Alex Jones and under the InfoWars
[02:17:31.430 --> 02:17:36.390]  team. I really do credit that as to why I'm able to you know get these types of
[02:17:36.390 --> 02:17:41.190]  clips because Alex's whole mentality was you know go where the story is, go where
[02:17:41.190 --> 02:17:44.990]  the mainstream media refuses to. So it's not that I'm addicted to the
[02:17:44.990 --> 02:17:48.910]  insanity, I'm just addicted to telling the truth and helping the American people and
[02:17:48.910 --> 02:17:52.790]  I really do credit Alex for you know really instilling that within me early
[02:17:52.790 --> 02:17:55.470]  on in my career.
[02:17:57.710 --> 02:18:01.950]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, is a
[02:18:01.950 --> 02:18:06.590]  historic book that documents the globals in their own words plan for our future.
[02:18:06.590 --> 02:18:10.430]  That is a hellish future. Now you'll be always, while they still allow books I
[02:18:10.430 --> 02:18:13.230]  guess they're starting to ban them, be able to get an unsigned copy of The
[02:18:13.230 --> 02:18:17.030]  Great Reset and the War for the World at bookstores, Amazon or InfoWarsWare.com
[02:18:17.030 --> 02:18:20.950]  but you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after
[02:18:20.950 --> 02:18:24.670]  the signed copies we got run out and there's about a thousand left of them
[02:18:24.670 --> 02:18:29.150]  right now. So get your copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World a signed
[02:18:29.150 --> 02:18:32.870]  copy at InfoWarsWare.com and there is a markup there because this is a

[02:18:43.750 --> 02:18:47.990]  unsigned copies but I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to

[02:18:59.750 --> 02:19:04.590]  happening right now. There is a war that will control my destiny, your destiny, our
[02:19:04.710 --> 02:19:08.710]  children's destinies and that war is something that we can win but it takes

[02:20:03.190 --> 02:20:06.590]  it's Alex Jones
[02:20:06.570 --> 02:20:28.770]  Well, I've known who Michael Yeun is for a decade, and I've been blessed to be able to
[02:20:28.770 --> 02:20:29.770]  interview him.
[02:20:29.770 --> 02:20:30.770]  Thanks to Mike Adams getting him on.
[02:20:30.770 --> 02:20:36.010]  He's a fellow Texan, lives outside Austin-Dripping Springs, but consecutively, the footage he
[02:20:36.010 --> 02:20:42.410]  gets is just so game-changing, but let's give some perspective to this just briefly.
[02:20:42.410 --> 02:20:48.850]  I'm not making light of five dead people and wounded in Kentucky and Louisville.
[02:20:48.850 --> 02:20:53.330]  I'm not making light of the transgender person going and killing those three little kids and
[02:20:53.330 --> 02:20:56.050]  three innocent teachers and the principal.
[02:20:56.050 --> 02:21:00.490]  But if you look statistically at the hundreds of thousands dead in Mexico, hundreds of thousands
[02:21:00.490 --> 02:21:06.930]  dead trying to come here, all the insanity and the story of the human trafficking and
[02:21:06.930 --> 02:21:13.690]  the sex trafficking and all this stuff, and it's a huge story, and the media consecutively
[02:21:13.690 --> 02:21:18.250]  working together covers it all up.
[02:21:18.250 --> 02:21:19.770]  But the truth is getting out there.
[02:21:19.770 --> 02:21:20.770]  This is just amazing.
[02:21:20.770 --> 02:21:26.730]  Here it is revealed, suspected Kentucky bank robber posted, bank shooter, not robber, posted
[02:21:26.730 --> 02:21:29.410]  anti-Trump pro-lockdown content on Reddit.
[02:21:29.410 --> 02:21:30.570]  He hated Trump.
[02:21:30.570 --> 02:21:31.810]  He wanted endless lockdowns.
[02:21:31.810 --> 02:21:33.090]  He was a liberal.
[02:21:33.090 --> 02:21:39.449]  They're suppressing this, just like they're suppressing the manifesto of the shooter in
[02:21:39.449 --> 02:21:42.289]  Tennessee of that Christian school.
[02:21:42.289 --> 02:21:46.570]  And this is how they try to manage perception, how they lie in crime statistics and what
[02:21:46.570 --> 02:21:47.570]  they do.
[02:21:47.570 --> 02:21:52.930]  So this is just a window into the control, and as bad as it is him killing five people,
[02:21:52.930 --> 02:21:56.650]  it is a drop in the bucket compared to what's really going on with our border and the destruction
[02:21:56.650 --> 02:21:57.650]  of our sovereignty.
[02:21:57.650 --> 02:22:00.890]  I'm Mike Adams with naturalnews.com, working with Michael Gahan, investigative journalist
[02:22:00.890 --> 02:22:01.890]  with exclusive footage.
[02:22:01.890 --> 02:22:02.890]  We've been rolling.
[02:22:02.890 --> 02:22:03.890]  This is B-Roll.
[02:22:03.890 --> 02:22:04.890]  Please continue.
[02:22:04.890 --> 02:22:07.610]  Well, there's a lot more footage, so feel free to roll that.
[02:22:07.610 --> 02:22:13.529]  Also, I want to ask your producers to bring up the logo of the OIM or slash IOM of the
[02:22:13.529 --> 02:22:19.250]  United Nations, because that logo shows the family in the center of a split, fractured
[02:22:19.250 --> 02:22:22.730]  planet in a spiral kind of vortex.
[02:22:22.730 --> 02:22:28.810]  And so it shows that the mission of the United Nations migration program is to actually shatter
[02:22:28.810 --> 02:22:29.810]  the planet.
[02:22:29.810 --> 02:22:30.810]  Yeah.
[02:22:30.810 --> 02:22:31.810]  There you can kind of see it there.
[02:22:31.810 --> 02:22:36.110]  OIM in Espanol or IOM in English.
[02:22:36.110 --> 02:22:41.130]  You can see that at the website IOM.int, by the way, is where you can bring that up in
[02:22:41.130 --> 02:22:42.369]  English, I believe.
[02:22:42.369 --> 02:22:43.369]  So there you go.
[02:22:43.369 --> 02:22:45.490]  A fractured planet with a family in the center.
[02:22:45.490 --> 02:22:49.890]  So they've weaponized the families of innocent people around the world.
[02:22:49.890 --> 02:22:51.289]  I want to be clear, Alex.
[02:22:51.289 --> 02:22:54.850]  I am not in any way condemning these migrant individuals.
[02:22:54.850 --> 02:22:56.490]  They are victims as well.
[02:22:56.490 --> 02:22:57.490]  They have been corralled.
[02:22:57.490 --> 02:23:00.050]  They're victims of three years of lockdown.
[02:23:00.050 --> 02:23:01.050]  Exactly.
[02:23:01.050 --> 02:23:02.050]  Exactly.
[02:23:02.050 --> 02:23:05.170]  And by the way, they think they're coming to a country of freedom.
[02:23:05.170 --> 02:23:06.170]  They're not.
[02:23:06.170 --> 02:23:09.570]  They're coming, even if they make it to America, they're coming to a country run by totalitarian
[02:23:09.570 --> 02:23:14.949]  lunatics who are just as bad, in many cases worse, than the tyranny they fled, wherever
[02:23:14.949 --> 02:23:16.130]  they fled from.
[02:23:16.130 --> 02:23:17.770]  They're coming to another tyranny.
[02:23:17.770 --> 02:23:21.490]  They are being used as pawns to try to rig the next election.
[02:23:21.490 --> 02:23:25.490]  They're being used as weapons against the American people, not to assimilate with the
[02:23:25.490 --> 02:23:26.490]  American people.
[02:23:26.490 --> 02:23:30.250]  So everybody that you're seeing there, those are people from Haiti right there in line.
[02:23:30.250 --> 02:23:31.930]  They are victims as well.
[02:23:31.930 --> 02:23:33.529]  All these people are victims.
[02:23:33.529 --> 02:23:38.449]  And then there is a criminal element that is using this, exploiting this, to get in and
[02:23:38.449 --> 02:23:40.529]  to carry out crimes in America.
[02:23:40.529 --> 02:23:44.850]  All kinds of crimes, robberies and cyber crimes and even terrorism.
[02:23:44.850 --> 02:23:48.770]  There are radicals from the Middle East that use this vector to get into the United States.
[02:23:48.770 --> 02:23:51.690]  So it's absolutely incredible.
[02:23:51.690 --> 02:23:55.250]  This is the couple I spoke with in Chinese.
[02:23:55.250 --> 02:23:58.670]  They look like a perfectly innocent, young couple.
[02:23:58.670 --> 02:24:00.789]  Maybe they want to be Americans.
[02:24:00.789 --> 02:24:02.710]  Maybe they'd be great Americans.
[02:24:02.710 --> 02:24:05.170]  But this woman told me, yeah, they're from mainland China.
[02:24:05.170 --> 02:24:07.090]  They're on their way to the United States.
[02:24:07.090 --> 02:24:10.770]  And it's like, what are you doing in Darien Gap, right?
[02:24:10.770 --> 02:24:13.730]  It's just the craziest thing.
[02:24:13.730 --> 02:24:19.529]  So this is a massive, massive suffering of human beings across the board.
[02:24:19.529 --> 02:24:21.970]  So Alex, I don't know.
[02:24:21.970 --> 02:24:26.010]  It's always impressive when you know your wife's Taiwanese, when you speak Chinese.
[02:24:26.010 --> 02:24:29.730]  But in Chinese, you can see, you see on the phone, you're talking to her.
[02:24:29.730 --> 02:24:32.650]  We probably get yawned on via phone if we can do it with you.
[02:24:32.650 --> 02:24:33.650]  Come on tomorrow.
[02:24:33.650 --> 02:24:35.410]  But what did you say to her in Chinese?
[02:24:35.410 --> 02:24:37.730]  Speak to the Chinese for a minute or so.
[02:24:37.730 --> 02:24:38.730]  Yeah.
[02:24:38.730 --> 02:24:42.130]  I said, you know, Ni hao, nǐ, nǐ me shì zhōngguó rén ma?
[02:24:42.130 --> 02:24:43.570]  I mean, are you Chinese?
[02:24:43.570 --> 02:24:44.570]  She said, yes.
[02:24:44.570 --> 02:24:46.930]  I said, nǐ me shì dà lù de rén?
[02:24:46.930 --> 02:24:47.930]  Mainland Chinese.
[02:24:47.930 --> 02:24:48.930]  She said, yes.
[02:24:48.930 --> 02:24:49.930]  And I said, I'm an American.
[02:24:49.930 --> 02:24:51.289]  Wǒ shì měi guō rén.
[02:24:51.289 --> 02:24:53.250]  And I asked her, are you going to America?
[02:24:53.250 --> 02:24:55.289]  Nǐ me yào qù měi guō ma?
[02:24:55.289 --> 02:24:56.289]  And she said, yes.
[02:24:56.289 --> 02:24:57.810]  Confirmed that on the way to America.
[02:24:57.810 --> 02:24:59.610]  I told her, thank you.
[02:24:59.610 --> 02:25:03.529]  And I told her, my friend there, that Michael Yan is my friend.
[02:25:03.529 --> 02:25:06.890]  Tā shì wǒ de péng yǒu zhè lǐ, xì xiàn nǐ men.
[02:25:06.890 --> 02:25:09.730]  And they got on the bus and went their way.
[02:25:09.730 --> 02:25:12.850]  I mean, again, they seemed like a perfectly nice couple.
[02:25:12.850 --> 02:25:14.970]  I'm not saying anything bad about this couple.
[02:25:14.970 --> 02:25:17.650]  But maybe they're fleeing the tyranny in China.
[02:25:17.650 --> 02:25:20.770]  But they're going to be sheep-dipped in the liberal combat.
[02:25:20.770 --> 02:25:21.770]  Yes.
[02:25:21.770 --> 02:25:22.770]  Exactly.
[02:25:22.770 --> 02:25:23.770]  Exactly.
[02:25:23.770 --> 02:25:28.690]  And they all think, and Michael Yan will tell you this when he's in studio, they all think
[02:25:28.690 --> 02:25:32.930]  that Biden is their savior because Biden is being promoted as the man that's allowing
[02:25:32.930 --> 02:25:33.930]  them to come to America.
[02:25:33.930 --> 02:25:37.410]  We have videos of them in t-shirts chanting Biden, Biden, Biden.
[02:25:37.410 --> 02:25:38.730]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:25:38.730 --> 02:25:43.770]  And boy, are they in for a surprise when they actually get to America and find out you don't
[02:25:43.770 --> 02:25:44.810]  have freedom of speech.
[02:25:44.810 --> 02:25:46.289]  You don't have economic freedom.
[02:25:46.289 --> 02:25:48.770]  If you don't bow down to the regime, you are censored.
[02:25:48.770 --> 02:25:49.770]  You are deplatformed.
[02:25:49.770 --> 02:25:50.770]  You are punished.
[02:25:50.770 --> 02:25:51.770]  You are defamed.
[02:25:51.770 --> 02:25:55.770]  Everything horrible will happen to you in America, just like under a communist regime
[02:25:55.770 --> 02:26:01.449]  like China or the former Soviet Union, for example, or modern day Cuba or North Korea.
[02:26:01.449 --> 02:26:07.410]  The United States under these totalitarians has become the nightmare regime of the world.
[02:26:07.410 --> 02:26:11.170]  And so they are hopping out of the frying pan and into the fire.
[02:26:11.170 --> 02:26:13.490]  And they don't want to talk about the big issue.
[02:26:13.490 --> 02:26:16.010]  The U.N. camps organized the debit cards.
[02:26:16.010 --> 02:26:20.210]  But since you mentioned it, here's a clip from just a few days ago of them chanting
[02:26:20.210 --> 02:26:21.210]  Biden.
[02:26:21.210 --> 02:26:22.210]  Here it is.
[02:26:22.210 --> 02:26:33.690]  It's a very important question.
[02:26:33.690 --> 02:26:37.289]  Do you like President Trump or President Biden?
[02:26:37.289 --> 02:26:38.289]  Biden?
[02:26:38.289 --> 02:26:39.289]  Biden?
[02:26:39.289 --> 02:26:40.289]  Biden?
[02:26:40.289 --> 02:26:41.289]  Biden?
[02:26:41.289 --> 02:26:42.289]  Biden?
[02:26:42.289 --> 02:26:43.289]  Biden?
[02:26:43.289 --> 02:26:44.289]  Biden?
[02:26:44.289 --> 02:26:45.289]  Biden?
[02:26:45.289 --> 02:26:46.289]  Biden?
[02:26:46.289 --> 02:26:47.289]  Biden?
[02:26:47.289 --> 02:26:48.289]  Biden?
[02:26:48.289 --> 02:26:49.289]  Biden?
[02:26:49.289 --> 02:26:50.289]  Biden?
[02:26:50.289 --> 02:26:51.289]  Biden?
[02:26:51.289 --> 02:26:52.289]  Biden?
[02:26:52.289 --> 02:26:53.289]  Biden?
[02:26:53.289 --> 02:26:54.289]  Biden?
[02:26:54.289 --> 02:26:55.289]  Biden?
[02:26:55.289 --> 02:26:56.289]  I'll just say this.
[02:26:56.289 --> 02:26:59.730]  Look how good shape those guys are in, because they're not eating GMO in Colombia.
[02:26:59.730 --> 02:27:00.730]  Yeah.
[02:27:00.730 --> 02:27:01.730]  I mean, that's an example.
[02:27:01.730 --> 02:27:05.170]  That's what Americans look like, whether they're black or white or whatever, 50 years ago.
[02:27:05.170 --> 02:27:06.170]  Mike Adams.
[02:27:06.170 --> 02:27:07.170]  Yeah.
[02:27:07.170 --> 02:27:08.170]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:27:08.170 --> 02:27:13.930]  And again, they're marching into what has become a totalitarian hellhole in many ways.
[02:27:13.930 --> 02:27:15.289]  And they will be transported.
[02:27:15.850 --> 02:27:23.610]  Homeland Security and Mayorkas of DHS is actually involved in this operation to transport these
[02:27:23.610 --> 02:27:28.090]  people into key cities and key voting districts where the Democrats know that they need additional
[02:27:28.090 --> 02:27:32.690]  votes in order to try to overpower the revolt that is happening.
[02:27:32.690 --> 02:27:36.330]  And the State Department gives them maps of where to go.
[02:27:36.330 --> 02:27:37.330]  Absolutely.
[02:27:37.330 --> 02:27:38.770]  And the Red Cross gives them maps.
[02:27:38.770 --> 02:27:42.369]  And in fact, Michael Yan, he's out in the jungle right now.
[02:27:42.369 --> 02:27:46.330]  He's supposed to be coming back later today and is going to give us some video of those
[02:27:46.330 --> 02:27:49.650]  maps and some additional camp footage and so on.
[02:27:49.650 --> 02:27:51.050]  And you know, God bless that guy.
[02:27:51.050 --> 02:27:53.490]  He's out there putting his neck on the line to bring us this footage.
[02:27:53.490 --> 02:27:58.130]  Alex, you know, if it wasn't for you, the entire mainstream media will not touch this
[02:27:58.130 --> 02:27:59.130]  topic.
[02:27:59.130 --> 02:28:03.130]  If it wasn't for you and Alt Media, no one would know that this is happening.
[02:28:03.130 --> 02:28:08.869]  It's a total cover up of this massive human trafficking machine that has been set up and
[02:28:08.869 --> 02:28:12.470]  funded by the U.N. and the United States and is expanding.
[02:28:12.470 --> 02:28:18.150]  One of the images I uploaded to your team was an empty parking lot that's right next to
[02:28:18.150 --> 02:28:19.150]  this current facility.
[02:28:19.150 --> 02:28:20.150]  They're going to expand it, Alex.
[02:28:20.150 --> 02:28:23.630]  They're going to double or triple the size of this thing because they need a lot more
[02:28:23.630 --> 02:28:27.190]  people to come through to win the election in 2024.
[02:28:27.190 --> 02:28:29.550]  That's where this is going.
[02:28:29.550 --> 02:28:31.150]  It's just off the charts the same.
[02:28:31.150 --> 02:28:34.390]  There's a Western Union right there at the camp.
[02:28:34.390 --> 02:28:40.110]  It's actually at the San Vicente camp where they can get money to continue the journey.
[02:28:40.110 --> 02:28:42.710]  That's on the opposite side from that tent where you saw the Haitians and the refugees.
[02:28:42.710 --> 02:28:46.230]  That's where George Soros refills them with taxpayer money.
[02:28:46.230 --> 02:28:51.430]  We'll come back and talk about how to stop this with the great Mike Adams of naturalnews.com
[02:28:51.430 --> 02:28:58.670]  and pray for Michael Young on the front lines.
[02:28:58.670 --> 02:29:05.590]  If Alex Jones runs for president in the Republican Party, he has a chance of winning.
[02:29:05.590 --> 02:29:12.550]  If you just tuned in, you may be noticing I'm wearing an Alex Jones for president 2024
[02:29:12.550 --> 02:29:13.550]  shirt.
[02:29:13.550 --> 02:29:16.670]  I am not seriously planning to run for president.
[02:29:16.670 --> 02:29:20.750]  This is an idea of the crew had to have a triggering shirt, kind of next level Alex
[02:29:20.750 --> 02:29:21.750]  Jones was right.
[02:29:21.750 --> 02:29:26.270]  There's Infowars.com on the back, Alex Jones for president 2024 on the front.
[02:29:26.270 --> 02:29:27.270]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[02:29:27.270 --> 02:29:28.550]  It's made out of really nice fabric.
[02:29:28.550 --> 02:29:34.670]  It's high quality and it is a exclusive shirt to Infowars.com and when the shirts are gone,
[02:29:34.670 --> 02:29:35.670]  they're gone.
[02:29:35.670 --> 02:29:42.350]  We're doing one run of Alex Jones for president 2024 shirts and we'll have a historic memento.
[02:29:42.350 --> 02:29:46.550]  Be able to spread the word and meet a lot of like-minded people and you'll be able to keep
[02:29:46.550 --> 02:29:47.910]  us on the air.
[02:29:47.910 --> 02:29:48.910]  No way.
[02:29:48.910 --> 02:29:49.910]  No way.
[02:29:49.910 --> 02:29:50.910]  That's a bridge too far.
[02:29:50.910 --> 02:29:52.390]  That's no, it can't be.
[02:29:52.390 --> 02:29:58.150]  And I said on national television that he was going to win at Infowars.com.
[02:29:58.150 --> 02:30:02.310]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World is a historic
[02:30:02.310 --> 02:30:06.470]  book that documents the globals in their own words, plan for our future.
[02:30:06.470 --> 02:30:07.470]  That is a hellish future.
[02:30:07.470 --> 02:30:11.470]  Now you'll be always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them,
[02:30:11.470 --> 02:30:15.470]  be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World at bookstores,
[02:30:15.470 --> 02:30:19.670]  Amazon or Infowars.com, but you will never be able to get another signed copy of the
[02:30:19.670 --> 02:30:24.390]  book after the signed copies we got run out and there's about a thousand left of them
[02:30:24.390 --> 02:30:25.390]  right now.
[02:30:25.470 --> 02:30:30.869]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World, a signed copy at Infowars.com.
[02:30:30.869 --> 02:30:34.789]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[02:30:34.789 --> 02:30:38.630]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book, you'll also know that
[02:30:38.630 --> 02:30:40.350]  you help keep Infowars on the air.
[02:30:40.350 --> 02:30:43.910]  I'm going to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book or unsigned
[02:30:43.910 --> 02:30:48.990]  copies, but I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to Infowars.com and
[02:30:48.990 --> 02:30:53.630]  get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate to the library or give them
[02:30:53.630 --> 02:30:54.990]  to the local school.
[02:30:54.990 --> 02:30:55.990]  This is an Infowar.
[02:30:55.990 --> 02:30:58.110]  I'm counting on you and thank you for your support.
[02:30:58.110 --> 02:31:02.910]  Turbo Force is back, sold out for eight months and it's Turbo Force Plus.
[02:31:02.910 --> 02:31:08.990]  We made it even stronger, the strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere.
[02:31:08.990 --> 02:31:15.710]  Turbo Force is back in stock at Infowars.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:31:15.710 --> 02:31:22.230]  It's not just wide spectrum natural herbs that time release over 10 hours, should be
[02:31:22.230 --> 02:31:23.869]  called 10 hour energy.
[02:31:23.869 --> 02:31:29.310]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids
[02:31:29.310 --> 02:31:34.470]  that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name
[02:31:34.470 --> 02:31:35.470]  it.
[02:31:35.470 --> 02:31:38.910]  It is the super fuel.
[02:31:38.910 --> 02:31:40.350]  Rain Force Plus is great.
[02:31:40.350 --> 02:31:41.350]  Rain Force Ultra is great.
[02:31:41.350 --> 02:31:42.350]  They're two different nootropics.
[02:31:42.350 --> 02:31:46.230]  They go good with this, but this is the King Kong.
[02:31:46.230 --> 02:31:47.630]  This is the boss.
[02:31:47.630 --> 02:31:52.190]  Turbo Force, back in stock, discounted, Infowars.com.
[02:31:52.190 --> 02:31:55.190]  More power, more strength, more energy.
[02:31:58.190 --> 02:32:02.110]  Infowars, tomorrow's news today.
[02:32:02.110 --> 02:32:03.830]  This is their big move.
[02:32:03.830 --> 02:32:07.590]  So yeah, you say, why doesn't Biden address the disasters in the United States?
[02:32:07.590 --> 02:32:09.390]  He doesn't care.
[02:32:09.390 --> 02:32:10.590]  That's not his job.
[02:32:10.590 --> 02:32:12.350]  He's not the president of the United States.
[02:32:12.350 --> 02:32:16.070]  He's a puppet operating for the globalists.
[02:32:16.070 --> 02:32:20.670]  Appetites of the autocrat cannot be appeased.
[02:32:20.670 --> 02:32:21.670]  They must be opposed.
[02:32:21.670 --> 02:32:23.230]  And that's who he works with.
[02:32:23.230 --> 02:32:28.550]  Autocrats only understand one word, no, no, no.
[02:32:28.550 --> 02:32:29.550]  Exactly.
[02:32:29.550 --> 02:32:33.029]  And that's why we say no to your vaccines.
[02:32:33.029 --> 02:32:36.150]  We say no to you shutting down our businesses.
[02:32:36.150 --> 02:32:38.650]  We say no to you taking our firearms.
[02:32:38.650 --> 02:32:41.130]  We say no to you censoring our free speech.
[02:32:41.130 --> 02:32:44.750]  We say no to you selling us out to the World Health Organization.
[02:32:44.750 --> 02:32:47.310]  We say no to you getting us into World War III.
[02:32:47.310 --> 02:32:48.310]  You're right.
[02:32:48.310 --> 02:32:50.990]  We stand against autocrats like you, Joe Biden.
[02:32:50.990 --> 02:32:52.789]  And we say no.
[02:32:52.789 --> 02:33:05.830]  And we say no to your war.
[02:33:07.340 --> 02:33:29.340]  We break the silence, waking from the dead of night.
[02:33:29.340 --> 02:33:57.740]  All right, Mike Adams is the conduit with Michael Yawn on the ground in the
[02:33:58.740 --> 02:34:03.660]  bridge through the wilderness, 50 plus miles of death, rape, murder, road
[02:34:03.660 --> 02:34:07.820]  warrior, beyond road warrior between South America and Central America.
[02:34:08.300 --> 02:34:10.020]  Other key points you want to get into here.
[02:34:10.020 --> 02:34:11.420]  And we've got the B roll.
[02:34:11.420 --> 02:34:12.740]  It's a bridey on.com.
[02:34:13.580 --> 02:34:15.420]  That's a lot of it at info wars.com.
[02:34:15.820 --> 02:34:17.420]  Read the big reports, national news.com.
[02:34:17.660 --> 02:34:23.380]  But then the, the, the million foot view on what I covered the
[02:34:23.380 --> 02:34:25.340]  second hour and the first hour.
[02:34:26.260 --> 02:34:27.500]  Robert Kennedy, Jr.
[02:34:27.500 --> 02:34:33.260]  Donald Trump, Ron Paul, Rand Paul, Orban, uh, the new Swiss leader,
[02:34:33.260 --> 02:34:37.940]  the, the new Italian leader, the Brazilian leader, all saying there's a
[02:34:37.940 --> 02:34:41.060]  new world order coming out from our countries, there's been a coup
[02:34:41.060 --> 02:34:44.660]  corporately, that is such a positive thing that everything you've been
[02:34:44.660 --> 02:34:46.380]  talking about for decades, I've been talking about for decades.
[02:34:46.380 --> 02:34:49.900]  Mike is now mainstream identifying.
[02:34:49.900 --> 02:34:50.820]  We've been hijacked.
[02:34:51.260 --> 02:34:52.500]  That's a big defeat.
[02:34:52.500 --> 02:34:56.820]  So I want to get your view on where the battle space is right now.
[02:34:57.260 --> 02:34:59.260]  And the, and I know you're as smart as I am or smarter.
[02:35:00.060 --> 02:35:01.340]  The globalists are losing right now.
[02:35:01.900 --> 02:35:03.140]  They're not going to give up.
[02:35:03.140 --> 02:35:04.820]  What are they going to pull Mike Adams?
[02:35:05.660 --> 02:35:06.820]  Well, you're exactly right.
[02:35:06.820 --> 02:35:11.060]  The multiple vectors of their attempt to literally destroy the United
[02:35:11.060 --> 02:35:12.740]  States of America as a sovereign nation.
[02:35:13.300 --> 02:35:19.420]  Now, uh, I also, I interviewed a man named Tom Luongo, who I strongly
[02:35:19.420 --> 02:35:21.700]  recommend that you get them on your show.
[02:35:21.900 --> 02:35:25.620]  Maybe you've already interviewed him, but he's, uh, his theory is that
[02:35:25.660 --> 02:35:29.860]  Jerome Powell at the federal reserve is actually at war with the Davos
[02:35:29.860 --> 02:35:33.900]  socialists in Europe because the Davos socialists are trying to literally
[02:35:33.900 --> 02:35:37.500]  destroy all central banks around the world and have one world currency
[02:35:37.980 --> 02:35:41.420]  under the Davos crowd, which will eventually be under the bank of
[02:35:41.420 --> 02:35:42.860]  international settlements, the BIS.
[02:35:42.860 --> 02:35:44.780]  It'll be a one world digital currency.
[02:35:44.780 --> 02:35:45.260]  Let me interrupt.
[02:35:45.260 --> 02:35:47.660]  There's definitely a war over who's going to control this
[02:35:47.860 --> 02:35:48.980]  central bank digital currency.
[02:35:49.860 --> 02:35:50.020]  Yeah.
[02:35:50.020 --> 02:35:50.900]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:35:50.900 --> 02:35:54.260]  And this is why I more than ever, Alex, uh, and I'll just say this publicly,
[02:35:54.260 --> 02:35:57.580]  you know, I was skeptical of a lot of the crypto hype before, but right now
[02:35:57.580 --> 02:36:02.220]  we need a decentralized peer-to-peer cryptocurrency more than any time ever
[02:36:02.220 --> 02:36:07.100]  in history, because, uh, we won't have any Liberty left whatsoever.
[02:36:07.100 --> 02:36:08.900]  If we end up in a federal reserve,
[02:36:09.460 --> 02:36:11.500]  mass adoption will make it victorious.
[02:36:11.500 --> 02:36:12.660]  They can't put us all in jail.
[02:36:13.740 --> 02:36:13.980]  Yeah.
[02:36:13.980 --> 02:36:14.340]  Yeah.
[02:36:14.780 --> 02:36:15.460]  Well, exactly.
[02:36:15.500 --> 02:36:19.620]  But, but understand that right now, the fed under Powell, who was put in there
[02:36:19.620 --> 02:36:24.540]  by Trump, Powell may actually be a white hat operator from one point of view,
[02:36:24.820 --> 02:36:30.540]  which is to protect the existence of the United States financial system.
[02:36:30.540 --> 02:36:31.580]  That's what Soros does.
[02:36:31.580 --> 02:36:32.980]  He plunges central banks.
[02:36:32.980 --> 02:36:34.580]  Exactly, exactly.
[02:36:34.580 --> 02:36:34.900]  Right.
[02:36:34.980 --> 02:36:35.500]  Exactly.
[02:36:35.700 --> 02:36:39.580]  So, so Tom Luongo, um, is I think the best expert on this.
[02:36:39.580 --> 02:36:44.300]  He, he's got a blog called the guns, uh, gold goats and guns, by the way,
[02:36:44.300 --> 02:36:45.700]  a good guy to have on about that.
[02:36:46.020 --> 02:36:48.300]  And he's, he's adamant about this and I think he's right.
[02:36:48.580 --> 02:36:51.180]  And I think that raising the interest rates, here's what's going on.
[02:36:51.460 --> 02:36:55.260]  The interest rates that are raising are designed to destroy the, the Euro
[02:36:55.260 --> 02:36:59.260]  dollars as it's called, which is the, the, the amplified us dollar that's
[02:36:59.260 --> 02:37:03.060]  being multiplied by the European socialists, especially when interest
[02:37:03.060 --> 02:37:06.940]  rates were zero and they were flooding the world with those dollars, you
[02:37:06.940 --> 02:37:11.020]  know, essentially a ghost dollars, you could say, uh, so he's raising
[02:37:11.020 --> 02:37:13.140]  interest rates, which is hurting the U S economy.
[02:37:13.380 --> 02:37:17.940]  It's driving a lot of business down real estate, uh, you know, manufacturing.
[02:37:18.180 --> 02:37:22.660]  And small businesses, it's hurting a lot domestically, but it's kind of like he's,
[02:37:22.660 --> 02:37:26.300]  as I said, uh, Powell is drilling a hole in the side of the Titanic.
[02:37:26.300 --> 02:37:30.500]  The ship is going down, but he's throwing a lifeline to the banks in
[02:37:30.500 --> 02:37:34.340]  America while trying to destroy the socialist Davos crowd in Europe.
[02:37:34.340 --> 02:37:35.140]  No, no, exactly.
[02:37:35.140 --> 02:37:36.620]  We're not just at war with China there.
[02:37:36.620 --> 02:37:40.020]  There's a war between the EU and the U S well, exactly.
[02:37:40.020 --> 02:37:43.300]  And, and when I said, I mean, I mean, they are financially dead in, in, in
[02:37:43.300 --> 02:37:47.540]  Europe because they, they don't have, I mean, they don't have manufacturing
[02:37:47.660 --> 02:37:48.980]  that they can turn to anymore.
[02:37:48.980 --> 02:37:50.900]  Even the bakeries are shutting down in France because they're
[02:37:50.900 --> 02:37:52.220]  in a worse position than us.
[02:37:52.220 --> 02:37:53.780]  They've been deindustrialized way worse.
[02:37:53.860 --> 02:37:54.220]  Yep.
[02:37:54.420 --> 02:37:56.260]  Western Europe is history.
[02:37:56.260 --> 02:37:56.700]  Okay.
[02:37:56.820 --> 02:37:58.300]  It's going to collapse.
[02:37:58.380 --> 02:38:00.060]  It's just a matter of what that looks like.
[02:38:00.100 --> 02:38:05.220]  And, and the matter of timing, the United States doesn't have to, that's the thing.
[02:38:05.220 --> 02:38:07.820]  The United States has is so, so many resources.
[02:38:08.020 --> 02:38:12.580]  If we can get a hold of our elections once again, and have real election
[02:38:12.580 --> 02:38:16.660]  transparency and integrity, then we can peacefully take this country back.
[02:38:16.900 --> 02:38:18.300]  We can protect the border.
[02:38:18.500 --> 02:38:20.420]  We can get our debt under control.
[02:38:20.580 --> 02:38:24.620]  We can actually have a future and then perhaps we can, we can help Europe
[02:38:24.660 --> 02:38:27.780]  have a resurgence again, as well, just like we did post-World War II.
[02:38:27.980 --> 02:38:30.460]  So there is, there is hope for the world.
[02:38:30.460 --> 02:38:32.900]  There's also desperation on the part of the globalists who are
[02:38:32.900 --> 02:38:34.340]  trying everything in their power.
[02:38:34.340 --> 02:38:35.700]  Well, that was my next question.
[02:38:35.700 --> 02:38:36.820]  What are they going to pull next?
[02:38:37.860 --> 02:38:39.860]  Well, they're going to pull more false flags in America.
[02:38:39.860 --> 02:38:40.700]  No question about it.
[02:38:41.020 --> 02:38:46.500]  They're going to have more MK ultra operatives that may be a transgender
[02:38:46.500 --> 02:38:48.940]  violent militants who don't, I mean, I'm not saying that all
[02:38:48.940 --> 02:38:52.220]  transgenders are violent militants, but there is a wing that seems
[02:38:52.220 --> 02:38:54.740]  to be brainwashed into violence.
[02:38:54.740 --> 02:38:57.180]  Well, if you look at the whole program, it's public brainwashing.
[02:38:57.180 --> 02:38:58.580]  It's, it's classic brain.
[02:38:58.940 --> 02:38:59.540]  Absolutely.
[02:39:00.940 --> 02:39:01.140]  Yeah.
[02:39:01.140 --> 02:39:04.460]  And so we're going to see a lot more shootings and violence, sadly,
[02:39:04.460 --> 02:39:06.420]  that that's instigated by the regime.
[02:39:06.780 --> 02:39:09.540]  And we're, we're going to see, of course, a financial fallout that's
[02:39:09.540 --> 02:39:12.860]  going to hurt no matter what, even if we survive it, and I would just
[02:39:12.860 --> 02:39:17.140]  encourage people do your research, understand the risk of the dollar.
[02:39:17.220 --> 02:39:20.860]  And the hyperinflation is coming because that's, that's the way out of this.
[02:39:21.060 --> 02:39:23.620]  Uh, even according to the fed, they're just going to print, print, print,
[02:39:23.860 --> 02:39:28.620]  but on, on the other side, they're trying to maintain the viability of
[02:39:28.620 --> 02:39:32.420]  the United nations, I'm sorry, of the United States as an individual nation.
[02:39:32.660 --> 02:39:36.220]  So it's, there are many camps, Alex, as you know, there are many factions.
[02:39:36.580 --> 02:39:39.620]  Nobody's a hundred percent white hat out there.
[02:39:39.620 --> 02:39:40.740]  Nobody's a hundred percent black.
[02:39:40.740 --> 02:39:45.140]  And what scares the globalist is when the public learns not about
[02:39:45.140 --> 02:39:49.500]  baseball or football or Hollywood, but learns about the factions, then
[02:39:49.500 --> 02:39:53.220]  we're now in the game and we change the entire paradigm by our
[02:39:53.220 --> 02:39:55.020]  desires, our wishes, our actions.
[02:39:55.260 --> 02:39:56.660]  That's what this whole broadcast is about.
[02:39:56.660 --> 02:40:00.020]  It's what you do is get people to be like adults and admit the power
[02:40:00.020 --> 02:40:04.580]  players, how the world works and being on the same stage and, and, and,
[02:40:04.580 --> 02:40:06.340]  and being able to bargain basically.
[02:40:06.780 --> 02:40:08.780]  We're like a union, we're like a union.
[02:40:08.820 --> 02:40:11.620]  We're trying to create a human union that knows how stuff works.
[02:40:11.620 --> 02:40:12.340]  So we can bargain.
[02:40:13.460 --> 02:40:16.700]  And the number one, most important thing that I think you do, Alex,
[02:40:16.700 --> 02:40:20.260]  and to some extent I do it as well, is we set the example to other
[02:40:20.260 --> 02:40:25.020]  people, to have a voice, to be bold, to have courage, to come out and to
[02:40:25.020 --> 02:40:29.060]  demand freedom in every area of your life, whether it's finance or currency
[02:40:29.300 --> 02:40:33.900]  or jobs or education or families or speech or what have you, we, we must
[02:40:33.900 --> 02:40:37.700]  demand Liberty choices we make are the most powerful tool we have.
[02:40:37.700 --> 02:40:38.420]  Elaborate on that.
[02:40:39.100 --> 02:40:39.340]  Yeah.
[02:40:39.340 --> 02:40:42.620]  Well, and the example, the example that you make, you know, Alex, you
[02:40:42.620 --> 02:40:46.260]  never gave in to the globalists, although they, they tried to course
[02:40:46.260 --> 02:40:48.900]  you, you know, you've talked about it publicly, they offered you money.
[02:40:48.900 --> 02:40:49.700]  They offered you this and that.
[02:40:49.940 --> 02:40:50.700]  And you said no.
[02:40:50.700 --> 02:40:51.820]  And I'm in the same boat.
[02:40:51.820 --> 02:40:52.380]  We've said no.
[02:40:52.380 --> 02:40:54.860]  And we paid a heavy, heavy price for doing that.
[02:40:55.020 --> 02:40:57.420]  But it's, I haven't talked to you about this, but I know you have a very
[02:40:57.420 --> 02:40:59.500]  successful operation publishing all the world.
[02:41:00.180 --> 02:41:00.660]  Let me guess.
[02:41:00.660 --> 02:41:02.700]  They tried to buy you out for 10 times what you're worth.
[02:41:03.980 --> 02:41:04.300]  Oh yeah.
[02:41:04.300 --> 02:41:06.100]  They tried to buy me out years ago.
[02:41:06.140 --> 02:41:09.980]  And for an amount of money that now seems like, like a pittance, but,
[02:41:09.980 --> 02:41:13.380]  uh, it was, you know, it, it, it was tens of millions of dollars
[02:41:13.380 --> 02:41:14.740]  of a few years ago for sure.
[02:41:15.100 --> 02:41:19.100]  And, and again, my, my business is crushed by 99% compared to where
[02:41:19.100 --> 02:41:19.940]  it should be probably.
[02:41:19.940 --> 02:41:20.940]  And, and yours is too.
[02:41:21.140 --> 02:41:24.740]  Infowars should be a multi-billion dollar enterprise at this point
[02:41:24.980 --> 02:41:27.660]  with the, the high quality products that you have with the reach you
[02:41:27.660 --> 02:41:30.300]  have with the audience you have, they have suppressed you and suppress
[02:41:30.300 --> 02:41:33.940]  me by my calculations, at least 99%.
[02:41:33.940 --> 02:41:34.420]  No, I agree.
[02:41:34.420 --> 02:41:36.900]  But what really is valuable is the currency of victory.
[02:41:37.860 --> 02:41:38.900]  Well, absolutely.
[02:41:38.900 --> 02:41:41.500]  And, and what's the point of having wealth in a society?
[02:41:41.500 --> 02:41:44.820]  If you're not free, you know, freedom is the currency
[02:41:44.820 --> 02:41:46.340]  of the future of humanity.
[02:41:46.580 --> 02:41:48.780]  We need freedom more than we need money.
[02:41:48.780 --> 02:41:51.220]  We just use money to try to get traction.
[02:41:51.220 --> 02:41:54.140]  Freedom creates the environment that money can be spent in.
[02:41:55.260 --> 02:41:56.100]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:41:56.100 --> 02:41:58.540]  And you, and I know you agree with me on this, Alex.
[02:41:58.580 --> 02:42:01.740]  It's not that you or I or other individuals want to be
[02:42:01.740 --> 02:42:03.740]  wealthy in a world of poor people.
[02:42:03.740 --> 02:42:05.620]  We want everybody to be wealthy.
[02:42:05.620 --> 02:42:09.780]  We want abundance to be a universal aspect of our society.
[02:42:09.780 --> 02:42:11.460]  Which the globalists admit they're threatened by.
[02:42:11.460 --> 02:42:13.580]  They, they're having to suppress wealth, folks.
[02:42:13.700 --> 02:42:15.140]  It's not like they have a problem producing it.
[02:42:15.420 --> 02:42:16.660]  That's why America is such a threat.
[02:42:16.700 --> 02:42:18.380]  It's easy for everybody to be rich.
[02:42:19.180 --> 02:42:23.980]  If, if they weren't confiscating our money and, and destroying our currency,
[02:42:24.180 --> 02:42:28.340]  most middle-class Americans would already be financially wealthy.
[02:42:28.460 --> 02:42:29.940]  They'd have enough set away for retirement.
[02:42:29.940 --> 02:42:31.060]  Their homes would be worth more.
[02:42:31.060 --> 02:42:32.180]  Their dollars would be worth more.
[02:42:32.180 --> 02:42:35.300]  Yeah, the robots and all this automation, we weren't even supposed to be working now.
[02:42:35.300 --> 02:42:36.300]  Now old people have to work.
[02:42:36.460 --> 02:42:36.940]  Stay there.
[02:42:36.940 --> 02:42:37.660]  You're on fire.
[02:42:37.660 --> 02:42:40.180]  Naturalnews.com, brighteon.com.
[02:42:40.180 --> 02:42:44.220]  It's just like Band-Op video, as amazing as all these band contributors.
[02:42:44.220 --> 02:42:45.660]  Mike Adams, love him.
[02:42:45.860 --> 02:42:47.740]  He'll be right back with us straight ahead.
[02:42:47.740 --> 02:42:48.180]  Stay with us.
[02:42:48.180 --> 02:42:49.540]  Got a lot of news to hit straight ahead.
[02:42:56.000 --> 02:43:05.000]  They decided to not perp walking, not put him in handcuffs, not do a mugshot because they knew that that would help Trump.
[02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:07.000]  Didn't they know this would backfire?
[02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:11.000]  We were waiting for the mugshot. We learned today they wouldn't have it, so we've made our own.
[02:43:11.000 --> 02:43:16.000]  And it says political prisoner with an image of President Trump.
[02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:20.000]  The shirt is being printed now in Texas. It'll be shipping out to you in one week.
[02:43:20.000 --> 02:43:27.000]  Political prisoner with Trump on the front there in a mugshot jail background.
[02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:32.000]  It's a fundraiser shirt. It says InfoWars.com on the back of the shirt.
[02:43:32.000 --> 02:43:35.000]  We also have Alex Jones for president. No, I'm not running for president.
[02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:38.000]  It's a really nice navy blue, high quality shirt, red, white and blue.
[02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:42.000]  Alex Jones for president 2024. It's a fun conversational piece and a limited edition shirt.
[02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:44.000]  Great way to fund the operation.
[02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:58.000]  So get your Alex Jones for president and Trump mugshot shirts at InfoWars.com or by calling toll free triple eight two five three three one three nine.
[02:43:58.000 --> 02:44:02.000]  Thousands of former Nazis went to work for the United States government.
[02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:06.000]  A flying disk has been found and is now in the possession of the army.
[02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:08.000]  There is a bulletin from CBS News.
[02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:11.000]  President Kennedy has been shot.
[02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:14.000]  This is a different kind of war.
[02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:18.000]  The USS Liberty had just been attacked by Israeli jets and torpedo boats.
[02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:22.000]  A CIA could manipulate the news in the United States.
[02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:26.000]  They took the babies out of antibiotics and left the children to die on the cold floor.
[02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:30.000]  It was almost as if there were a plan in place.
[02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:34.000]  We need to go into the capital.
[02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:36.000]  You will always have conspiracy theories.
[02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:38.000]  They are nothing but distractions.
[02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:40.000]  You guys censored Harvard educated doctors.
[02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:42.000]  You silenced those voices.
[02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:46.000]  What we want to do in Davos is push the reset button.
[02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:53.000]  Soon as we start exposing the great reset, the sooner these globalists start going to prison.
[02:44:53.000 --> 02:45:05.000]  Right now, I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to InfoWarsTour.com
[02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:09.000]  and gotten the great products that enrich your life, that empower your immune system and your body
[02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:11.000]  and keep us on air.
[02:45:11.000 --> 02:45:15.000]  I am humbly, hand in hand, talking to the viewers and listeners that have tuned in,
[02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:19.000]  many of you for years, and never gone to InfoWarsTour.com.
[02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:24.000]  We know the vast, vast, vast, vast majority of you never actually go to InfoWarsTour.com
[02:45:24.000 --> 02:45:28.000]  and never experienced these great products and never found the operation.
[02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:31.000]  Sure, you share a link, you share an article, you tell folks about the show.
[02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:32.000]  That's great, and I thank you.
[02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:34.000]  But we need funds to operate.
[02:45:34.000 --> 02:45:37.000]  Plus, we've got really great products that do amazing things for people,
[02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:41.000]  like our CBD oil and our Fizzy Magnesium and our SleepAid and our Nitric Oxide
[02:45:41.000 --> 02:45:43.000]  and our Real Red Pill Plus.
[02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:45.000]  All of these are really great products that keep us on air.
[02:45:45.000 --> 02:45:47.000]  Plus, you're missing out on having these products.
[02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:50.000]  So get off the bench, get in the game, step to the plate,
[02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:53.000]  and go to InfoWarsTour.com right now
[02:45:53.000 --> 02:45:56.000]  and get these great InfoWars products at InfoWarsTour.com.
[02:45:58.000 --> 02:46:04.000]  Hydrofluorosilicic acid is the third most deadly acid on earth,
[02:46:04.000 --> 02:46:06.000]  and they've got our children drinking that.
[02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:12.000]  This is a psychotic death cult, period, case closed, out to get you and your family.
[02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:17.000]  We sell the Alexa Pure Breeze, made by the My Patriot Supply Ready Hour Group.
[02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:20.000]  It's been around about 15 years, became the biggest company in the last six.
[02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:24.000]  They went out, hired engineers, reverse engineered the fancy best water filter system
[02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:30.000]  out there that sells for twice the price, and they made it as good in all the studies.
[02:46:30.000 --> 02:46:33.000]  It reduces things to non-detectable levels, thousands of chemicals.
[02:46:33.000 --> 02:46:35.000]  But you can go pay two or three times.
[02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:37.000]  There's four or five other filters out there that are just as good.
[02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:42.000]  We sell the very best, highest-grade water filtration system for half the price to leading competitor.
[02:46:42.000 --> 02:46:48.000]  And the media says we're bad and a cult for telling you you should filter your water.
[02:46:48.000 --> 02:46:50.000]  You should also filter your shower water.
[02:46:50.000 --> 02:46:51.000]  That's another way you absorb this crap.
[02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:53.000]  But I'm done talking about that.
[02:46:53.000 --> 02:46:55.000]  The point is you can get the filters at InfoWarsTour.com.
[02:46:55.000 --> 02:46:56.000]  They're discounted right now.
[02:46:56.000 --> 02:46:57.000]  Finally back in stock.
[02:46:58.000 --> 02:47:05.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:06.500 --> 02:47:18.240]  Take the highway to the end of the night, end of the night.
[02:47:18.240 --> 02:47:21.960]  Take the journey to the bright midnight, end of the night.
[02:47:21.960 --> 02:47:22.960]  End of the night.
[02:47:22.960 --> 02:47:29.960]  Take a journey to the bright midnight, end of the night.
[02:47:29.960 --> 02:47:34.360]  All right, Mike's going to leave us here in about 15 minutes.
[02:47:34.360 --> 02:47:35.640]  I'll continue on for one segment.
[02:47:35.640 --> 02:47:39.280]  Kate Daly will take over, but I've got some other breaking news I need to hit.
[02:47:39.280 --> 02:47:40.280]  Look, look, look.
[02:47:40.280 --> 02:47:41.280]  Here's what it comes down to.
[02:47:41.280 --> 02:47:45.360]  I've been accused on air for 29 years of being a negative person.
[02:47:45.360 --> 02:47:48.320]  No, I believed in you, and I'm not going to sugarcoat stuff.
[02:47:48.320 --> 02:47:50.760]  When things are bad, I'll tell you we're behind.
[02:47:50.760 --> 02:47:52.840]  We are running the tables on the enemy right now.
[02:47:52.840 --> 02:47:56.160]  Yeah, they're bleeding us, they're destroying us, but people know they're doing it.
[02:47:56.160 --> 02:48:00.040]  So it's one thing to be asleep in a coma getting your ass beat, it's another thing
[02:48:00.040 --> 02:48:05.160]  to be getting your ass kicked and waking up, and every time we take a swing, we win politically.
[02:48:05.680 --> 02:48:07.560]  So I need your word of mouth.
[02:48:07.560 --> 02:48:08.560]  I need your prayer.
[02:48:08.560 --> 02:48:10.320]  I need your support.
[02:48:10.320 --> 02:48:15.080]  We have 1776 testosterone booze made by a big pharmaceutical company that also makes
[02:48:15.080 --> 02:48:16.080]  supplements.
[02:48:16.080 --> 02:48:19.000]  It's already a top-rated supplement in the country that they let us private label.
[02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:22.260]  That's available, discounted at InfoWarsTour.com, 40% off.
[02:48:22.260 --> 02:48:29.280]  We have PainMD, natural, incredible pain relief, InfoWarsTour.com in the InfoWars Platinum line.
[02:48:29.280 --> 02:48:31.720]  The HGH booze is sold out.
[02:48:31.720 --> 02:48:33.240]  We've got more coming in soon.
[02:48:33.560 --> 02:48:36.800]  You can also get TurboForce, 10 hours of clean energy.
[02:48:36.800 --> 02:48:39.320]  I will only take a quarter scoop when you first take it.
[02:48:39.320 --> 02:48:42.280]  It's finally back in stock after eight months, InfoWarsTour.com.
[02:48:42.280 --> 02:48:44.240]  We also have the Trump mugshot.
[02:48:44.240 --> 02:48:45.680]  They didn't do a real mugshot.
[02:48:45.680 --> 02:48:48.120]  It's our mugshot, popular shirt.
[02:48:48.120 --> 02:48:49.760]  It's coming in, I think, tomorrow.
[02:48:49.760 --> 02:48:51.320]  We had it printed here in Texas.
[02:48:51.320 --> 02:48:53.640]  We have the Alex Jones for President shirt, not really running for president.
[02:48:53.640 --> 02:48:59.800]  It's a fun shirt to meet like-minded people and trigger libtards, InfoWarsTour.com or
[02:48:59.800 --> 02:49:00.800]  888-253-3139.
[02:49:01.800 --> 02:49:06.080]  Get a copy of my book unsigned or do the fundraiser of the signed book.
[02:49:06.080 --> 02:49:07.080]  Not many are left.
[02:49:07.080 --> 02:49:10.600]  InfoWarsTour.com if you want a signed copy, last chance to get that.
[02:49:10.600 --> 02:49:15.400]  All right, going back to Mike Adams of naturalnews.com, Mike, when you get back into the U.N. invasion
[02:49:15.400 --> 02:49:19.560]  points, when you get back into the Trump indictment, when you get back into the war in Russia,
[02:49:19.560 --> 02:49:22.800]  when you get back into the admitting U.S. troops who are battling Russians, I told people
[02:49:22.800 --> 02:49:28.800]  15 months ago, all this craziness going on, what is front and center for you?
[02:49:28.800 --> 02:49:34.800]  Well, obviously, the Biden regime has to rig the 2024 election because if Trump gets
[02:49:34.800 --> 02:49:40.680]  in, Trump now has, I think, the proper frame of mind to just clean house like never before.
[02:49:40.680 --> 02:49:47.320]  I think if Trump becomes president, he would work with Congress to completely defund the
[02:49:47.320 --> 02:49:53.160]  FBI, maybe the DOJ, maybe the CDC, maybe the FDA as a leverage point to say, look, you're
[02:49:53.160 --> 02:49:56.760]  going to have zero money until you fire everybody, rebuild-
[02:49:56.760 --> 02:49:57.760]  Oh, yeah.
[02:49:57.760 --> 02:50:00.640]  He's wrong about the shots, but everything he said he'd do, he did.
[02:50:00.640 --> 02:50:01.640]  Exactly.
[02:50:01.640 --> 02:50:02.640]  Yeah.
[02:50:02.640 --> 02:50:03.640]  Yeah.
[02:50:03.640 --> 02:50:04.640]  I agree.
[02:50:04.640 --> 02:50:07.680]  Trump is absolutely wrong about the shots, but he now, because they prosecuted him, he
[02:50:07.680 --> 02:50:12.960]  now, he's in the same boat that you've been in for a long time, Alex, that he understands
[02:50:12.960 --> 02:50:14.360]  the seriousness of this.
[02:50:14.360 --> 02:50:18.800]  And my criticism of Trump is that for a long time, I think he felt like all the censorship
[02:50:18.800 --> 02:50:20.040]  and things and all the criminalization-
[02:50:20.040 --> 02:50:23.280]  He thought he could bend them to his will and he learned he can't.
[02:50:23.280 --> 02:50:24.580]  Well, yeah, exactly.
[02:50:24.580 --> 02:50:29.020]  Before he thought he was going to be insulated enough, and he's not, and he gets it now.
[02:50:29.020 --> 02:50:32.740]  And I think that Trump, if he gets into the White House, he's going to clean house like
[02:50:32.740 --> 02:50:33.740]  never before.
[02:50:33.740 --> 02:50:35.620]  And the establishment is absolutely terrified of that.
[02:50:35.620 --> 02:50:38.580]  Now, the other thing, Alex, that's critical for people to know, I don't know if you've
[02:50:38.580 --> 02:50:43.140]  covered this, and we got to give credit to Jim Hoft of the Gateway Pundit, because the
[02:50:43.140 --> 02:50:48.980]  Missouri versus Biden lawsuit, okay, that was filed by Attorney General Schmidt of Missouri.
[02:50:48.980 --> 02:50:54.120]  And by the way, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., his lawsuit has now been joined with that lawsuit.
[02:50:54.160 --> 02:50:59.240]  And I'm sure Robert Barnes has looked at this dutifully, but if you go through the discovery
[02:50:59.240 --> 02:51:04.360]  of that lawsuit, which I have done, it is every smoking gun that you need to prosecute
[02:51:04.360 --> 02:51:09.200]  the federal government for violations of civil rights, of censorship, and First Amendment
[02:51:09.200 --> 02:51:10.720]  violations against the American people.
[02:51:10.720 --> 02:51:12.480]  We've covered it some, but you're right.
[02:51:12.480 --> 02:51:13.480]  Those are ripening.
[02:51:13.480 --> 02:51:14.920]  Those cases are winning.
[02:51:14.920 --> 02:51:16.680]  Tell people why that's so important.
[02:51:16.680 --> 02:51:21.280]  Well, it's because it's no longer a question of did the federal government violate the
[02:51:21.280 --> 02:51:23.920]  First Amendment rights of the American people, including you.
[02:51:23.920 --> 02:51:25.680]  Infowars is named in those documents.
[02:51:25.680 --> 02:51:27.120]  So is Brighteon, by the way.
[02:51:27.120 --> 02:51:28.480]  So is Natural News.
[02:51:28.480 --> 02:51:29.480]  Health Ranger is named.
[02:51:29.480 --> 02:51:32.320]  Alice Jones is named by name in those documents.
[02:51:32.320 --> 02:51:35.480]  They targeted us for illegal censorship.
[02:51:35.480 --> 02:51:36.480]  Smoking guns are the American discovery.
[02:51:36.480 --> 02:51:37.640]  And by the way, we're not drama queens.
[02:51:37.640 --> 02:51:39.360]  I knew that like weeks ago.
[02:51:39.360 --> 02:51:41.800]  We didn't even mention, hey, the feds targeted us.
[02:51:41.800 --> 02:51:45.320]  Like, listeners, we're not going to sit here and whine about this, but you want somebody
[02:51:45.320 --> 02:51:46.320]  to fight for you, we are.
[02:51:46.320 --> 02:51:48.880]  So when I say that, I just want to win.
[02:51:48.880 --> 02:51:49.880]  Support Natural News.
[02:51:49.880 --> 02:51:50.880]  Buy the products.
[02:51:51.480 --> 02:51:52.480]  Go to the store.
[02:51:52.480 --> 02:51:53.480]  Because, yeah, I mean, the enemy.
[02:51:53.480 --> 02:51:54.480]  I'm so proud of this.
[02:51:54.480 --> 02:51:57.960]  A new document is about to come out where the Rockefeller Foundation specifically is
[02:51:57.960 --> 02:52:00.200]  targeting us and saying we're the number one enemy.
[02:52:00.200 --> 02:52:01.440]  By the way, you're mentioned, too.
[02:52:01.440 --> 02:52:02.880]  I'm so proud of that, Mike.
[02:52:02.880 --> 02:52:03.880]  I'm not looking for trouble.
[02:52:03.880 --> 02:52:07.480]  But man, if you're going to fight, it's good to have the enemy say, take out that.
[02:52:07.480 --> 02:52:09.200]  That's our main enemy.
[02:52:09.200 --> 02:52:12.600]  And we have you know, we have to thank Missouri and the attorney general there.
[02:52:12.600 --> 02:52:16.800]  And Ken Paxton in Texas is working in other ways as well.
[02:52:16.800 --> 02:52:18.080]  Attorney General of Texas.
[02:52:18.080 --> 02:52:22.080]  And these these states that still represent America are fighting hard against the Biden
[02:52:22.080 --> 02:52:23.080]  regime.
[02:52:23.080 --> 02:52:26.120]  And they're they're fronting a lot of the costs for the discovery that can be picked
[02:52:26.120 --> 02:52:31.840]  up by other attorneys, perhaps attorneys for Infowars or and elaborate on that, how we're
[02:52:31.840 --> 02:52:35.760]  in the documents, because people need to know what is the enemy fearing, like what they
[02:52:35.760 --> 02:52:37.400]  fear is our power.
[02:52:37.400 --> 02:52:39.560]  We need to celebrate what the enemy fears.
[02:52:39.560 --> 02:52:40.560]  Yeah.
[02:52:40.560 --> 02:52:45.040]  We are specifically named on target lists that were handed over to big tech, along with government
[02:52:45.040 --> 02:52:49.960]  developed tools for big tech to use to censor our speech by simply labeling everything that
[02:52:49.960 --> 02:52:50.960]  we say misinformation.
[02:52:50.960 --> 02:52:53.400]  OK, that's that's what they do.
[02:52:53.400 --> 02:52:58.360]  But what this means, the good news, the goldmine in this, Alex, is that you and I and Jim Hoft
[02:52:58.360 --> 02:53:04.280]  and everybody who is named in in those in the discovery has absolute standing before
[02:53:04.280 --> 02:53:05.320]  the courts.
[02:53:05.320 --> 02:53:08.560]  So they can't have the government can't have these lawsuits thrown out and say, you don't
[02:53:08.560 --> 02:53:09.560]  have standing.
[02:53:09.560 --> 02:53:10.560]  We didn't censor you.
[02:53:10.560 --> 02:53:11.560]  Yeah, you did.
[02:53:11.560 --> 02:53:12.560]  It's already in discovery.
[02:53:12.560 --> 02:53:14.200]  It's already on the record.
[02:53:14.360 --> 02:53:15.880]  So we all have standing.
[02:53:15.880 --> 02:53:20.120]  And it's a blatant violation of the First Amendment, a blatant violation of civil rights.
[02:53:20.120 --> 02:53:25.240]  So now is the best time for all of those who have been named, including, by the way, Children's
[02:53:25.240 --> 02:53:26.700]  Health Defense.
[02:53:26.700 --> 02:53:31.920]  And I think Zero Hedge was named and a bunch of other alternative media operations, Breitbart,
[02:53:31.920 --> 02:53:33.280]  for example.
[02:53:33.280 --> 02:53:35.280]  Now is the time to file suit.
[02:53:35.280 --> 02:53:40.520]  Now is the time to pursue this where you can go after the federal government's violation
[02:53:40.520 --> 02:53:41.520]  of your civil rights.
[02:53:41.520 --> 02:53:42.520]  Let's be clear.
[02:53:42.520 --> 02:53:44.920]  This isn't just surveillance and censorship.
[02:53:44.920 --> 02:53:51.840]  This is government illegally combining with corporations and media to censor and block
[02:53:51.840 --> 02:53:52.840]  an election.
[02:53:52.840 --> 02:53:53.840]  No.
[02:53:53.840 --> 02:53:54.840]  Yeah.
[02:53:54.840 --> 02:53:55.840]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:53:55.840 --> 02:54:01.080]  And simply because you endorsed Trump and I supported Trump and these other people supported
[02:54:01.080 --> 02:54:02.080]  Trump.
[02:54:02.080 --> 02:54:05.880]  So everybody who supported Trump or anybody who had skepticism about the safety of the
[02:54:05.880 --> 02:54:10.480]  vaccines, which we now know are extremely dangerous, was targeted in the right by the
[02:54:10.480 --> 02:54:11.480]  questions.
[02:54:11.480 --> 02:54:12.480]  Open borders.
[02:54:12.480 --> 02:54:13.480]  The Afghan withdrawal.
[02:54:13.480 --> 02:54:14.480]  Four shots.
[02:54:14.480 --> 02:54:15.480]  Lockdowns.
[02:54:15.480 --> 02:54:16.480]  And again, for everybody that's in the queue thing.
[02:54:16.480 --> 02:54:20.040]  I'm not mad at him, but just listen, listen.
[02:54:20.040 --> 02:54:21.040]  Trump was surrounded.
[02:54:21.040 --> 02:54:22.040]  He had almost no help.
[02:54:22.040 --> 02:54:23.040]  Stop thinking.
[02:54:23.040 --> 02:54:24.040]  You've seen that.
[02:54:24.040 --> 02:54:25.040]  That was a lie.
[02:54:25.040 --> 02:54:33.440]  Admit that we've got to all unify and be strong and then understand that this proves the illegality
[02:54:33.440 --> 02:54:37.160]  of what's going on and shows how weak the enemy is.
[02:54:37.160 --> 02:54:39.400]  You're worried about Mike Adams and Alex Jones.
[02:54:39.400 --> 02:54:40.400]  Yeah.
[02:54:40.400 --> 02:54:43.800]  Isn't that incredible that you and I threatened their entire empire?
[02:54:43.800 --> 02:54:46.800]  That's how fragile they are, because they don't have control.
[02:54:46.800 --> 02:54:47.800]  Right.
[02:54:47.800 --> 02:54:49.560]  And they don't have control because people want to be free.
[02:54:49.560 --> 02:54:52.880]  They don't have control because information wants to be free.
[02:54:52.880 --> 02:54:57.940]  We value freedom and being autonomous more than life and that they can't beat that.
[02:54:57.940 --> 02:54:58.940]  We're not for sale.
[02:54:58.940 --> 02:54:59.940]  That's right.
[02:54:59.940 --> 02:55:00.940]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:55:00.940 --> 02:55:03.840]  And they're not used to that because they can usually bribe or have kickbacks or they
[02:55:03.840 --> 02:55:07.000]  can threaten or court course or shut down everybody.
[02:55:07.000 --> 02:55:12.200]  In fact, their plan, Alex, was to financially bankrupt you and I and others in this space
[02:55:12.200 --> 02:55:15.440]  to the point where we could never file suit against them.
[02:55:15.440 --> 02:55:16.640]  That was their plan all along.
[02:55:16.640 --> 02:55:19.360]  It was an economic strangulation plan.
[02:55:19.360 --> 02:55:21.040]  And that has failed.
[02:55:21.040 --> 02:55:22.040]  Right.
[02:55:22.040 --> 02:55:27.520]  And we you and I and others have continued to succeed because of the support of our audience
[02:55:27.520 --> 02:55:29.960]  and viewers who are cheering us on.
[02:55:29.960 --> 02:55:32.440]  I'm glad you said that right now, folks.
[02:55:32.440 --> 02:55:35.320]  You want somebody to stand up for you and we're all standing up together.
[02:55:35.320 --> 02:55:36.320]  I'm not like your leader.
[02:55:36.640 --> 02:55:37.640]  I'm not saying Mike's not.
[02:55:37.640 --> 02:55:38.640]  We're together.
[02:55:38.640 --> 02:55:39.640]  This is a war.
[02:55:39.640 --> 02:55:40.640]  We're winning.
[02:55:40.640 --> 02:55:41.640]  The enemy's scared of us.
[02:55:41.640 --> 02:55:43.440]  I want listeners to have it boiled down.
[02:55:43.440 --> 02:55:47.720]  Mike Adams and Tucker Carlson, Alex Jones, Donald Trump are not the tip of the spear.
[02:55:47.720 --> 02:55:49.600]  The people are the tip of the spear.
[02:55:49.600 --> 02:55:52.600]  And your word of mouth, your prayer and your financial support is critical.
[02:55:52.600 --> 02:55:55.360]  It is up to you whether we win or lose.
[02:55:55.360 --> 02:55:56.360]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:55:56.360 --> 02:55:57.360]  In any one of us.
[02:55:57.360 --> 02:56:02.880]  I mean, if I gave up tomorrow and walked away, it wouldn't change the fact that we're going
[02:56:02.880 --> 02:56:06.240]  to achieve victory because it's not about me or you, Alex, or any one person.
[02:56:07.160 --> 02:56:12.640]  It's about this entire pro-human, pro-freedom movement that is awakening like never before.
[02:56:12.640 --> 02:56:17.920]  We have simply ignited the brush fires in the minds of men and women.
[02:56:17.920 --> 02:56:20.000]  We have simply shown people what's going on.
[02:56:20.000 --> 02:56:22.760]  And Mike, can you not feel the spirit of victory?
[02:56:22.760 --> 02:56:25.520]  I mean, I can feel it right now like never before.
[02:56:25.520 --> 02:56:26.520]  Yeah.
[02:56:26.520 --> 02:56:28.000]  And you know what, Alex?
[02:56:28.000 --> 02:56:32.920]  Whether or not you or I are even here to see that victory, it's irrelevant.
[02:56:32.920 --> 02:56:37.480]  Because this is a cosmic level victory that transcends any individuals.
[02:56:37.480 --> 02:56:41.600]  And Alex, admittedly, I never wanted to be doing what I'm doing.
[02:56:41.600 --> 02:56:46.720]  I never wanted to have to be the guy in a studio covering the news talking about this.
[02:56:46.720 --> 02:56:50.080]  I remember 10 years ago, you were like, I just want to cover health news.
[02:56:50.080 --> 02:56:53.200]  But you got drafted, didn't you?
[02:56:53.200 --> 02:56:56.280]  It's like we all have to step up and do what's necessary.
[02:56:56.280 --> 02:56:58.880]  I'm just so glad that we're not alone anymore.
[02:56:58.880 --> 02:57:05.080]  For many years, you were just the lone voice or people like Steve Quayle or later on myself.
[02:57:05.080 --> 02:57:06.640]  We're not alone anymore.
[02:57:06.640 --> 02:57:08.240]  Humanity is with us, Alex.
[02:57:08.240 --> 02:57:11.160]  Humanity wants their world back.
[02:57:11.160 --> 02:57:16.860]  And we're right there with them, not leading them, but with them fighting this fight together.
[02:57:16.860 --> 02:57:18.120]  That's what we do.
[02:57:18.120 --> 02:57:19.120]  That's why we do this.
[02:57:19.120 --> 02:57:22.080]  Well, let's talk about that in the final segment with Mike Adams, naturalnews.com.
[02:57:22.080 --> 02:57:23.360]  You're absolutely right.
[02:57:23.360 --> 02:57:26.560]  But that's my greatest concern is we are winning.
[02:57:26.560 --> 02:57:28.240]  What is the enemy going to do?
[02:57:28.280 --> 02:57:36.280]  A nuclear war, digital collapse, turn the power off, and folks, they're not going to give up the show.
[02:57:37.280 --> 02:57:38.280]  Stay there.
[02:57:38.280 --> 02:57:39.280]  Stay there.
[02:57:39.280 --> 02:57:40.280]  We'll come right back to you in two minutes.
[02:57:40.280 --> 02:57:41.280]  Mike Adams, final segment.
[02:57:41.280 --> 02:57:41.780]  Stay with us.
[02:57:45.500 --> 02:57:56.060]  If Alex Jones runs for president in the Republican Party, he has a chance of winning.
[02:57:56.060 --> 02:58:02.900]  If you just tuned in, you may be noticing I'm wearing an Alex Jones for president 2024
[02:58:02.900 --> 02:58:03.900]  shirt.
[02:58:03.900 --> 02:58:06.900]  I am not seriously planning to run for president.
[02:58:06.900 --> 02:58:11.020]  This is an idea of the crew had to have a triggering shirt, kind of next level Alex
[02:58:11.020 --> 02:58:12.020]  Jones was right.
[02:58:12.020 --> 02:58:16.500]  There's Infowars.com in the back, Alex Jones for president 2024 on the front.
[02:58:16.500 --> 02:58:17.500]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[02:58:17.500 --> 02:58:18.820]  It's made out of really nice fabric.
[02:58:18.820 --> 02:58:20.140]  It's high quality.
[02:58:20.140 --> 02:58:23.580]  And it is a exclusive shirt to Infowars.com.
[02:58:23.580 --> 02:58:25.420]  And when the shirts are gone, they're gone.
[02:58:25.420 --> 02:58:31.140]  We're doing one run of Alex Jones for president 2024 shirts.
[02:58:31.140 --> 02:58:34.820]  And we'll have a historic memento, be able to spread the word, meet a lot of like minded
[02:58:34.820 --> 02:58:35.820]  people.
[02:58:35.820 --> 02:58:38.180]  And you'll be able to keep us on the air.
[02:58:38.180 --> 02:58:39.180]  No way.
[02:58:39.180 --> 02:58:40.180]  No way.
[02:58:40.180 --> 02:58:41.180]  That's a bridge too far.
[02:58:41.340 --> 02:58:42.660]  No, it can't be.
[02:58:42.660 --> 02:58:47.820]  And I said on national television that he was going to win at Infowars.com.
[02:58:47.820 --> 02:58:52.420]  I talk a lot about the great successes Infowars has had.
[02:58:52.420 --> 02:58:54.780]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[02:58:54.780 --> 02:58:58.100]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[02:58:58.100 --> 02:59:04.020]  When we talk about the crew at Infowars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[02:59:04.020 --> 02:59:07.020]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[02:59:07.500 --> 02:59:11.100]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in
[02:59:11.100 --> 02:59:16.420]  every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[02:59:16.420 --> 02:59:19.580]  So for myself and the whole Infowars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[02:59:19.580 --> 02:59:25.740]  I only encourage you now to realize that Infowars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[02:59:25.740 --> 02:59:26.740]  I know you spread the word.
[02:59:26.740 --> 02:59:27.740]  I know you pray for us.
[02:59:27.740 --> 02:59:28.740]  And that's wonderful.
[02:59:28.740 --> 02:59:29.740]  Keep doing it.
[02:59:29.740 --> 02:59:34.220]  But most viewers and listeners never go to Infowars.com and you never buy great products
[02:59:34.220 --> 02:59:37.740]  that enrich and empower your life, all at the same time, keep us on air.
[02:59:37.740 --> 02:59:42.140]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at Infowars.com.
[02:59:42.140 --> 02:59:46.340]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to Infowars.com, our funding problems will
[02:59:46.340 --> 02:59:47.340]  be over.
[02:59:47.340 --> 02:59:49.900]  Please take action now.
[02:59:49.900 --> 02:59:55.900]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:04.220 --> 03:00:20.220]  Freedom came my way one day, but Sheriff John Brown came to shoot me down, so I shot him.
[03:00:34.220 --> 03:01:01.940]  They're going to go full nuclear as a metaphor, but it may actually be a nuclear false flag.
[03:01:01.940 --> 03:01:06.220]  They're going to try cyber attacks on the financial infrastructure.
[03:01:06.220 --> 03:01:11.060]  They're going to crash the dollar on purpose and try to drive us into a universal basic
[03:01:11.060 --> 03:01:15.540]  income digital currency system, CBDC, for sure.
[03:01:15.540 --> 03:01:16.540]  That's going to happen.
[03:01:16.540 --> 03:01:19.540]  It could happen this summer, but it's right around the corner.
[03:01:19.540 --> 03:01:24.660]  They're going to try to provoke race wars and transgender versus non-transgender wars.
[03:01:24.660 --> 03:01:30.540]  They really want to have non-transgenders violently attack transgenders so they can evoke this
[03:01:30.540 --> 03:01:34.660]  massive gender war, essentially, is what it is.
[03:01:34.660 --> 03:01:40.300]  I'm so glad that the American people have resisted that, and they have de-escalated,
[03:01:40.300 --> 03:01:45.880]  and they have simply called out the trans-violent militants that have been shooting up schools
[03:01:45.880 --> 03:01:47.380]  like in Nashville and so on.
[03:01:47.380 --> 03:01:48.780]  We have to de-escalate violence.
[03:01:48.780 --> 03:01:52.180]  We have to de-escalate emergencies, and we have to navigate.
[03:01:52.180 --> 03:01:57.860]  We have to be prepared in every way possible with backup supplies of money, food, communications,
[03:01:57.860 --> 03:02:01.780]  everything, because they're going to start crashing entire infrastructure systems around
[03:02:01.780 --> 03:02:02.780]  us.
[03:02:02.780 --> 03:02:03.780]  That is absolutely coming.
[03:02:03.780 --> 03:02:06.380]  Again, it's not because we're scared of violence.
[03:02:06.380 --> 03:02:08.980]  We're winning societally, culturally, spiritually.
[03:02:08.980 --> 03:02:13.460]  The enemy wants violence, so we need to be very Christ-like right now, not out of weakness,
[03:02:13.460 --> 03:02:15.380]  but out of strength.
[03:02:15.380 --> 03:02:20.700]  We need to prepare not only for ourselves, but also if you can, if you have enough funds,
[03:02:20.700 --> 03:02:25.140]  prepare at the community level or for neighbors and family, because there's going to be a lot
[03:02:25.140 --> 03:02:29.260]  of desperation out there as supply chain disruptions get worse.
[03:02:29.260 --> 03:02:30.260]  Also-
[03:02:30.260 --> 03:02:31.260]  Oh, you're totally right.
[03:02:31.260 --> 03:02:32.460]  I mean, the supply chain's breaking down.
[03:02:32.460 --> 03:02:37.700]  You've been on top of that before me, and now the housing market, the commercial market,
[03:02:37.700 --> 03:02:41.940]  the car market, this is getting bad.
[03:02:41.940 --> 03:02:47.380]  They're going to roll out a chimeric pandemic now, which is Ebola plus HIV plus bird flu.
[03:02:47.380 --> 03:02:49.260]  You've covered this extensively.
[03:02:49.260 --> 03:02:53.060]  You know the vaccine companies are already preparing the vaccines for that.
[03:02:53.060 --> 03:02:54.820]  The narrative is being prepared.
[03:02:54.820 --> 03:02:59.820]  The quarantine camps in states like Washington are still being readied for mass quarantines,
[03:02:59.820 --> 03:03:04.540]  which of course will target conservatives and gun owners, and gun control is continuing
[03:03:04.540 --> 03:03:05.540]  to be pushed.
[03:03:05.540 --> 03:03:08.020]  But Alex, I think they're too late on every front.
[03:03:08.020 --> 03:03:10.060]  I think they've already lost the war.
[03:03:10.060 --> 03:03:12.620]  They're just trying to maximize casualties on their way out.
[03:03:12.620 --> 03:03:14.220]  I think humanity is going to win this.
[03:03:14.220 --> 03:03:16.140]  I think God is with us.
[03:03:16.140 --> 03:03:24.260]  I think human freedom will prevail, and again, whether or not any individual is here is irrelevant.
[03:03:24.260 --> 03:03:29.820]  We've awakened together, all of us, so many people around the world that humanity will
[03:03:29.820 --> 03:03:33.820]  overcome this tyranny, and then the history books will look back at this at the craziest
[03:03:33.820 --> 03:03:37.460]  time that has ever existed that we know of on this planet.
[03:03:37.460 --> 03:03:40.020]  It's been bizarre to live through this, and it's not over.
[03:03:40.020 --> 03:03:42.220]  And the globalists were going to run this attack regardless.
[03:03:42.220 --> 03:03:45.980]  At least we're fighting back and having victory, and I know now they're scared.
[03:03:45.980 --> 03:03:48.580]  I look at the body language of all of them.
[03:03:48.580 --> 03:03:50.220]  They know they've lost.
[03:03:50.220 --> 03:03:51.220]  Yeah.
[03:03:51.220 --> 03:03:52.900]  Yeah, they've lost.
[03:03:52.940 --> 03:03:56.340]  But again, they're in desperation mode, and some of them don't yet realize that they've
[03:03:56.340 --> 03:03:57.340]  lost.
[03:03:57.340 --> 03:04:02.540]  They think that they still command their imaginary armies like Hitler did in the last days of
[03:04:02.540 --> 03:04:04.340]  World War II, but they don't.
[03:04:04.340 --> 03:04:05.820]  They don't command the people anymore.
[03:04:05.820 --> 03:04:08.700]  They can't just order everybody into a digital wallet.
[03:04:08.700 --> 03:04:11.020]  They can't order everybody to love Biden.
[03:04:11.020 --> 03:04:12.020]  It's not working.
[03:04:12.020 --> 03:04:13.020]  It's broken.
[03:04:13.020 --> 03:04:16.100]  The faith has been fractured in the artificial systems.
[03:04:16.100 --> 03:04:17.100]  No one trusts the banks.
[03:04:17.100 --> 03:04:18.100]  No one trusts the FBI.
[03:04:18.100 --> 03:04:19.620]  No one trusts the mainstream media.
[03:04:19.620 --> 03:04:24.900]  No one trusts the Biden regime except a few still brainwashed remnants of the left.
[03:04:24.900 --> 03:04:25.900]  Everybody else is waking up.
[03:04:25.900 --> 03:04:30.980]  And so their answer is cyber attacks, power outages, nuclear war.
[03:04:30.980 --> 03:04:35.300]  So let's not kid ourselves, but at least our souls are in the right place, and people in
[03:04:35.300 --> 03:04:38.140]  government and corporations should really do whatever they can to leak information and
[03:04:38.140 --> 03:04:39.140]  stop this.
[03:04:39.140 --> 03:04:40.140]  Naturalnews.com.
[03:04:40.140 --> 03:04:43.340]  Look forward to Michael, Jan, and more of your reports at naturalnews.com.
[03:04:43.340 --> 03:04:44.780]  We'll be covering it tomorrow.
[03:04:44.780 --> 03:04:45.780]  Mike Adams, thank you so much.
[03:04:45.780 --> 03:04:46.780]  I salute you for your work.
[03:04:46.780 --> 03:04:47.780]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:04:47.780 --> 03:04:48.780]  God bless you.
[03:04:49.740 --> 03:04:52.140]  The best part about this job is I get to know folks like Mike Adams.
[03:04:52.140 --> 03:04:53.140]  We'll be right back.
[03:04:53.140 --> 03:04:54.140]  Stay with us.
[03:05:00.140 --> 03:05:06.060]  Humanity is in a fight for its very life, and InfoWars for decades has been at the very
[03:05:06.060 --> 03:05:09.860]  forefront of the fight for a pro-human future.
[03:05:09.860 --> 03:05:13.540]  We can't stay on air without your help, and I want to thank you all for your past support.
[03:05:13.540 --> 03:05:17.180]  And I want to encourage those of you that have never bought products at InfoWarsStore.com
[03:05:17.180 --> 03:05:21.260]  to go there and experience how amazing these products really are.
[03:05:21.260 --> 03:05:25.380]  Ultimate Bone Broth, finally sold out for over two years, back in stock.
[03:05:25.380 --> 03:05:28.020]  Real Red Pill Plus, simply amazing.
[03:05:28.020 --> 03:05:32.060]  Nitric boosts what it does for your heart, your cardiovascular, critical.

[03:05:40.140 --> 03:05:44.460]  And the final 1,200 signed copies of my book, The Great Reset and the War for the World,
[03:05:44.460 --> 03:05:48.620]  and I'm not going to sign any more after that, are exclusively available at InfoWarsStore.com
[03:05:48.620 --> 03:05:49.620]  as well.
[03:05:49.620 --> 03:05:51.660]  In the last month, I got a little busy, so I didn't sign the books.
[03:05:51.660 --> 03:05:52.660]  We didn't have them for sale.
[03:05:52.660 --> 03:05:56.340]  But now, I signed the last books, you can get them right now.
[03:05:56.340 --> 03:06:08.460]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:08.540 --> 03:06:10.540]  Don't tread on me.
[03:06:10.540 --> 03:06:14.540]  To secure peace, is to prepare for war.
[03:06:38.540 --> 03:06:40.540]  Never surrender.
[03:06:40.540 --> 03:06:44.540]  Showing the fangs of rage.
[03:06:46.540 --> 03:06:48.540]  Stand up for me.
[03:06:52.540 --> 03:06:54.540]  So be it.
[03:06:54.540 --> 03:06:56.540]  Tread no more.
[03:06:56.540 --> 03:07:00.540]  To secure peace, is to prepare for war.
[03:07:01.540 --> 03:07:03.540]  So be it.
[03:07:03.540 --> 03:07:05.540]  Settle the score.
[03:07:05.620 --> 03:07:09.620]  Touch me again for the words that you will hear evermore.
[03:07:15.620 --> 03:07:17.620]  Don't tread on me.
[03:07:20.620 --> 03:07:22.620]  Lover, don't leave it.
[03:07:22.620 --> 03:07:24.620]  See with a deadly bite.
[03:07:24.620 --> 03:07:26.620]  Quick as the blue tongue.
[03:07:26.620 --> 03:07:29.620]  Forced as a lightning strike.
[03:07:29.620 --> 03:07:31.620]  Shining with brightness.
[03:07:31.620 --> 03:07:33.620]  Always in surveillance.
[03:07:33.700 --> 03:07:35.700]  Beyond evermore.
[03:07:35.700 --> 03:07:38.700]  End of the fatalist.
[03:07:39.700 --> 03:07:41.700]  No, no, no, no.
[03:07:41.700 --> 03:07:43.700]  Don't tread on me.
[03:07:47.700 --> 03:07:49.700]  So be it.
[03:07:49.700 --> 03:07:51.700]  Tread no more.
[03:07:51.700 --> 03:07:55.700]  To secure peace, is to prepare for war.
[03:07:56.700 --> 03:07:58.700]  So be it.
[03:07:58.700 --> 03:08:00.700]  Settle the score.
[03:08:00.780 --> 03:08:04.780]  Touch me again for the words that you will hear evermore.
[03:08:04.780 --> 03:08:06.780]  Don't tread on me.
[03:08:08.780 --> 03:08:11.780]  All right, Kate Daly is going to take over.
[03:08:11.780 --> 03:08:12.780]  Here's just a few minutes.
[03:08:12.780 --> 03:08:14.780]  Here's some of the news I didn't hit.
[03:08:14.780 --> 03:08:16.780]  I'm sure it'll cover a lot more.
[03:08:16.780 --> 03:08:18.780]  Knock it out of the park as it always does.
[03:08:18.780 --> 03:08:20.780]  In about 50 minutes, 52 minutes from now.
[03:08:20.780 --> 03:08:22.780]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[03:08:22.780 --> 03:08:24.780]  Madmaxworld.tv
[03:08:24.780 --> 03:08:26.780]  Look at this.
[03:08:26.780 --> 03:08:28.780]  Again, if you really want to have
[03:08:28.860 --> 03:08:30.860]  lesbian sex, homosexual sex,
[03:08:30.860 --> 03:08:32.860]  whatever it is, you're an adult,
[03:08:32.860 --> 03:08:34.860]  I'm not attacking you.
[03:08:34.860 --> 03:08:36.860]  The point is, is that less than 1%
[03:08:36.860 --> 03:08:38.860]  identified as homosexual
[03:08:38.860 --> 03:08:40.860]  10 years ago.
[03:08:40.860 --> 03:08:42.860]  Now it's 7.2%.
[03:08:42.860 --> 03:08:44.860]  In many school districts in leftist areas,
[03:08:44.860 --> 03:08:46.860]  up to 50% of the children
[03:08:46.860 --> 03:08:48.860]  identify as that because they were
[03:08:48.860 --> 03:08:50.860]  brainwashed to do it.
[03:08:50.860 --> 03:08:52.860]  That is about breaking down the family.
[03:08:52.860 --> 03:08:54.860]  That is about depopulation.
[03:08:54.860 --> 03:08:56.860]  That is about a corporate agenda,
[03:08:56.940 --> 03:08:58.940]  ladies and gentlemen.
[03:08:58.940 --> 03:09:00.940]  That is about destruction.
[03:09:00.940 --> 03:09:02.940]  An example of this is I've seen studies
[03:09:02.940 --> 03:09:04.940]  and statistics on it. A lot of women grow up,
[03:09:04.940 --> 03:09:06.940]  they get inducted into lesbianism,
[03:09:06.940 --> 03:09:08.940]  girls are easy to deal with,
[03:09:08.940 --> 03:09:10.940]  and they're a lesbian for the first 10 years
[03:09:10.940 --> 03:09:12.940]  of their sexual life. So they're like 18,
[03:09:12.940 --> 03:09:14.940]  they're a lesbian until they're like 28,
[03:09:14.940 --> 03:09:16.940]  and almost all those women.
[03:09:16.940 --> 03:09:18.940]  Half my buddies are married to lesbians.
[03:09:18.940 --> 03:09:20.940]  They're not lesbians anymore.
[03:09:20.940 --> 03:09:22.940]  It doesn't mean everybody doesn't admire
[03:09:22.940 --> 03:09:24.940]  a woman or attract a woman. Women are incredible.
[03:09:25.020 --> 03:09:27.020]  But the point is that it's not what
[03:09:27.020 --> 03:09:29.020]  we're designed to do, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:09:29.020 --> 03:09:31.020]  Men and women go together with children.
[03:09:31.020 --> 03:09:33.020]  Men aren't supposed to be off
[03:09:33.020 --> 03:09:35.020]  screwing each other. Women aren't supposed
[03:09:35.020 --> 03:09:37.020]  to be shacked up together. It doesn't
[03:09:37.020 --> 03:09:39.020]  really happen in the real world.
[03:09:39.020 --> 03:09:41.020]  But they're
[03:09:41.020 --> 03:09:43.020]  pushing it because they want you to be
[03:09:43.020 --> 03:09:45.020]  alone, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:09:45.020 --> 03:09:47.020]  I'm not judging people. I'm not
[03:09:47.020 --> 03:09:49.020]  attacking people. I'm not giving the left
[03:09:49.020 --> 03:09:51.020]  what they want. I don't hate these people.
[03:09:51.020 --> 03:09:53.020]  I've been around the block probably
[03:09:53.100 --> 03:09:55.100]  50 times. What I'm saying
[03:09:55.100 --> 03:09:57.100]  is that this is a deliberate
[03:09:57.100 --> 03:09:59.100]  corporate agenda by the
[03:09:59.100 --> 03:10:01.100]  establishment.
[03:10:01.100 --> 03:10:03.100]  It's designed to make you alone
[03:10:03.100 --> 03:10:05.100]  just like big tech
[03:10:05.100 --> 03:10:07.100]  and social media to control you.
[03:10:07.100 --> 03:10:09.100]  That's a fact. No one denies that.
[03:10:09.100 --> 03:10:11.100]  It's on their own Facebook and Google
[03:10:11.100 --> 03:10:13.100]  and Twitter documents that we want to make
[03:10:13.100 --> 03:10:15.100]  you alone and control you and run
[03:10:15.100 --> 03:10:17.100]  you. Henry Ford wanted
[03:10:17.100 --> 03:10:19.100]  to pay his employees enough to buy a car.
[03:10:19.100 --> 03:10:21.100]  These people don't want
[03:10:21.180 --> 03:10:23.180]  you to have any money.
[03:10:23.180 --> 03:10:25.180]  It's an evil agenda.
[03:10:25.180 --> 03:10:27.180]  So we've got that. 7.2% of
[03:10:27.180 --> 03:10:29.180]  U.S. adults identify as LGBT
[03:10:29.180 --> 03:10:31.180]  because they're told
[03:10:31.180 --> 03:10:33.180]  it's a cool thing to do. But you know what's
[03:10:33.180 --> 03:10:35.180]  really happening in Japan, Italy, and the U.S.
[03:10:35.180 --> 03:10:37.180]  Japan is the worst. 1.1 children?
[03:10:37.180 --> 03:10:39.180]  There won't be Japanese
[03:10:39.180 --> 03:10:41.180]  in 100 years, that number.
[03:10:41.300 --> 03:10:44.300]  The men and women have been broken up.
[03:10:44.300 --> 03:10:47.300]  And they just say, well, I don't date women, so I'm gay.
[03:10:47.300 --> 03:10:49.300]  And they statistically studied it.
[03:10:49.300 --> 03:10:51.300]  They're not even having sex with men.
[03:10:51.300 --> 03:10:53.300]  They're alone, folks.
[03:10:53.300 --> 03:10:56.300]  Alone is where they want you.
[03:10:56.300 --> 03:10:59.300]  Alone, alone, alone.
[03:10:59.300 --> 03:11:01.300]  And that's where this goes.
[03:11:01.300 --> 03:11:04.300]  The transgenders aren't committing suicide or getting killed by right wingers.
[03:11:04.300 --> 03:11:08.300]  They're committing suicide and being killed by the culture they're in
[03:11:08.300 --> 03:11:11.300]  that is incredibly destructive.
[03:11:11.300 --> 03:11:13.300]  Here's some more news.
[03:11:13.300 --> 03:11:15.300]  Husband of BBC presenter killed by COVID vaccine,
[03:11:15.300 --> 03:11:19.300]  says AstraZeneca vaccine is unsafe and effective product.
[03:11:19.300 --> 03:11:21.300]  CDC behavior change.
[03:11:21.300 --> 03:11:24.300]  Project targeted vaccine critics was funded by Pfizer
[03:11:24.300 --> 03:11:30.300]  and New York misinformation response unit tied to the CIA.
[03:11:30.300 --> 03:11:32.300]  Look what was pulled out of a cadaver.
[03:11:32.300 --> 03:11:35.300]  None of it is protein or platelets.
[03:11:35.300 --> 03:11:37.300]  It's all spike protein.
[03:11:37.300 --> 03:11:39.300]  Big thing on that.
[03:11:39.300 --> 03:11:42.300]  And it goes on and on and on.
[03:11:42.300 --> 03:11:44.300]  But they're doing damage control.
[03:11:44.300 --> 03:11:47.300]  That woman two and a half years ago that collapsed, never seen after that.
[03:11:47.300 --> 03:11:50.300]  Now she's popped up and says, oh, it was no big deal.
[03:11:50.300 --> 03:11:52.300]  I'm still alive.
[03:11:52.300 --> 03:11:55.300]  That doesn't fly in the face of the reality.
[03:11:55.300 --> 03:11:57.300]  It falls on its face.
[03:11:57.300 --> 03:12:00.300]  And then we got this video of Elon Musk I want to play.
[03:12:00.300 --> 03:12:03.300]  Elon accuses BBC of failing to report on side effects of vaccinations
[03:12:03.300 --> 03:12:06.300]  and spreading misinformation when they call him a disinformationist.
[03:12:06.300 --> 03:12:07.300]  And he says, how am I disinfo?
[03:12:07.300 --> 03:12:09.300]  They can't respond.
[03:12:09.300 --> 03:12:12.300]  Because it's all just a throwaway line by conspiracy theorists.
[03:12:12.300 --> 03:12:14.300]  Here's a clip.
[03:12:14.300 --> 03:12:16.300]  Content you don't like or hateful.
[03:12:16.300 --> 03:12:18.300]  What do you mean to describe a hateful thing?
[03:12:18.300 --> 03:12:23.300]  Yeah, I mean, you know, just content that will solicit a reaction,
[03:12:23.300 --> 03:12:28.300]  something that may include something that is slightly racist or slightly sexist,
[03:12:28.300 --> 03:12:30.300]  those kinds of things.
[03:12:30.300 --> 03:12:33.300]  So you think if something is slightly sexist, it should be banned?
[03:12:33.300 --> 03:12:34.300]  No.
[03:12:34.300 --> 03:12:35.300]  Is that what you're saying?
[03:12:35.300 --> 03:12:36.300]  Well, I'm just curious.
[03:12:36.300 --> 03:12:39.300]  I'm trying to understand what you mean by hateful content.
[03:12:39.300 --> 03:12:42.300]  I'm asking for specific examples.
[03:12:42.300 --> 03:12:48.300]  And you just said that if something is slightly sexist, that's hateful content.
[03:12:48.300 --> 03:12:50.300]  Does that mean that it should be banned?
[03:12:50.300 --> 03:12:54.300]  Well, you've asked me whether my feed, whether it's got less or more.
[03:12:54.300 --> 03:12:56.300]  I'd say it's got slightly more.
[03:12:56.300 --> 03:12:58.300]  That's what I'm asking for examples.
[03:12:58.300 --> 03:12:59.300]  Can you name one example?
[03:12:59.300 --> 03:13:01.300]  I honestly don't.
[03:13:01.300 --> 03:13:03.300]  You can't name a single example.
[03:13:03.300 --> 03:13:04.300]  I'll tell you why.
[03:13:04.300 --> 03:13:07.300]  I can't actually use that feed anymore because I just don't particularly like it.
[03:13:07.300 --> 03:13:09.300]  Actually, a lot of people are quite similar.
[03:13:09.300 --> 03:13:11.300]  I only look at my followers.
[03:13:11.300 --> 03:13:12.300]  Well, hang on a second.
[03:13:12.300 --> 03:13:16.300]  You said you've seen more hateful content, but you can't name a single example, not even one.
[03:13:16.300 --> 03:13:20.300]  I'm not sure I've used that feed for the last three or four weeks.
[03:13:20.300 --> 03:13:22.300]  Well, then how did you see the hateful content?
[03:13:22.300 --> 03:13:26.300]  Because I've been using Twitter since you've taken it over for the last six months.
[03:13:26.300 --> 03:13:29.300]  Okay, so then you must have at some point seen for you hateful content.
[03:13:29.300 --> 03:13:30.300]  I'm asking for one example.
[03:13:30.300 --> 03:13:31.300]  Right.
[03:13:31.300 --> 03:13:32.300]  And you can't give a single one.
[03:13:33.300 --> 03:13:35.300]  Then I say so that you don't know what you're talking about.
[03:13:35.300 --> 03:13:36.300]  Really?
[03:13:36.300 --> 03:13:41.300]  Yes, because you can't give me a single example of hateful content, not even one tweet.
[03:13:41.300 --> 03:13:44.300]  And yet you claimed that the hateful content was high.
[03:13:44.300 --> 03:13:45.300]  Well, all right.
[03:13:45.300 --> 03:13:46.300]  And again, the clip's too long.
[03:13:46.300 --> 03:13:47.300]  I've got to throw it to Kate Daly.
[03:13:47.300 --> 03:13:53.300]  We'll add it in post when it's to Bandot Video where he exposes that they covered up the side effects and blocked therapeutics.
[03:13:53.300 --> 03:13:54.300]  So that's all coming up.
[03:13:54.300 --> 03:13:58.300]  Please remember, we're listener-supported, great T-shirts, great books, great films.
[03:13:58.300 --> 03:14:07.300]  Kate Daly's an amazing syndicated talk show host.
[03:14:07.300 --> 03:14:08.300]  KateDalyShow.com.
[03:14:08.300 --> 03:14:09.300]  She always has incredible guests on.
[03:14:09.300 --> 03:14:10.300]  Kate Daly, we love you.
[03:14:10.300 --> 03:14:11.300]  We appreciate you.
[03:14:11.300 --> 03:14:12.300]  Take over.
[03:14:12.300 --> 03:14:14.300]  Thank you, Alex, so much.
[03:14:14.300 --> 03:14:19.300]  I want to share some research with all of you that I've found alarming, alarming, totally alarming.
[03:14:19.300 --> 03:14:21.300]  And by the way, great segment with Mike Adams.
[03:14:21.300 --> 03:14:24.300]  Look, we have so much going on.
[03:14:24.300 --> 03:14:27.300]  I am a research hound, love research.
[03:14:27.300 --> 03:14:33.300]  And I'm telling you that with the distractions that we have today, there's some research I think that people are missing.
[03:14:33.300 --> 03:14:36.300]  And this has not been talked about at all.
[03:14:36.300 --> 03:14:39.300]  In fact, in fact, there's tracks being laid.
[03:14:39.300 --> 03:14:45.300]  They've been being laid for, well, since about 2009 and 2007, really.
[03:14:45.300 --> 03:14:47.300]  I should go back to 2007.
[03:14:47.300 --> 03:14:54.300]  And I found something really strange about the Democrat leftist loony fascination with tribal nations.
[03:14:55.300 --> 03:15:11.300]  Now, this is, it's really strange because out of 12 years on the radio, the last two years, I've noticed this huge shift in talking about tribal nations, executive orders, memorandums, you know, declarations, all kinds of things.
[03:15:11.300 --> 03:15:13.300]  And it's been hitting me a little strange.
[03:15:13.300 --> 03:15:16.300]  I thought, what is the fascination here with such a small group of people?
[03:15:16.300 --> 03:15:20.300]  Why are they putting this in the press endlessly?
[03:15:20.300 --> 03:15:21.300]  What is going on?
[03:15:21.300 --> 03:15:27.300]  And two weeks ago, something very, very big happened, and it didn't get a lot of attention.
[03:15:27.300 --> 03:15:30.300]  So I see a lot of pandering going on to the tribal nations.
[03:15:30.300 --> 03:15:32.300]  I'm not against Native Americans.
[03:15:32.300 --> 03:15:33.300]  They're good people.
[03:15:33.300 --> 03:15:36.300]  But are they getting used?
[03:15:36.300 --> 03:15:39.300]  This is going to be a very interesting 45 minutes.
[03:15:39.300 --> 03:15:42.300]  Let me just tell you, very, very interesting.
[03:15:42.300 --> 03:15:45.300]  Seems like a lot of attention is being paid, but why?
[03:15:45.300 --> 03:15:47.300]  I'll be right back on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:15:47.300 --> 03:15:49.300]  I'm Kate Dally, your guest host.
[03:15:49.300 --> 03:15:50.300]  I'll be right back.
[03:15:50.300 --> 03:15:51.300]  Stay with me.
[03:15:56.300 --> 03:16:05.300]  Every time I talk to you, you're either, like, on the border exposing the cartels and, like, coming under fire, or you're on the streets of some American city hanging out with drug addicts and criminals.
[03:16:05.300 --> 03:16:08.300]  And now you've gone to ground zero of a massive chemical spill.
[03:16:08.300 --> 03:16:10.300]  Are you addicted to the danger, Savannah?
[03:16:10.300 --> 03:16:12.300]  Have you ever considered that for a second?
[03:16:12.300 --> 03:16:15.300]  No, I'm addicted to helping my fellow Americans.
[03:16:15.300 --> 03:16:17.300]  I'm addicted to spreading the truth.
[03:16:17.300 --> 03:16:19.300]  And, again, you know, I have InfoWars to thank for that.
[03:16:19.300 --> 03:16:29.300]  Looking back on the day I was able to ask President Donald Trump two questions, I was so grateful because, you know, I truly was classically trained under Alex Jones and under the InfoWars team.
[03:16:29.300 --> 03:16:38.300]  And I really do credit that as to why I'm able to, you know, get these types of clips, because Alex's whole mentality was, you know, go where the story is.
[03:16:38.300 --> 03:16:41.300]  Go where the mainstream media refuses to.
[03:16:41.300 --> 03:16:43.300]  So it's not that I'm addicted to the insanity.
[03:16:44.300 --> 03:16:47.300]  I'm just addicted to telling the truth and helping the American people.
[03:16:47.300 --> 03:16:51.300]  And I really do credit Alex for, you know, really instilling that within me early on in my career.
[03:17:14.300 --> 03:17:20.300]  It's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time-release over 10 hours.
[03:17:20.300 --> 03:17:22.300]  It should be called 10-hour energy.
[03:17:22.300 --> 03:17:33.300]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name it.
[03:17:33.300 --> 03:17:36.300]  It is the super fuel.
[03:17:36.300 --> 03:17:38.300]  RainForce Plus is great.
[03:17:38.300 --> 03:17:39.300]  RainForce Ultra is great.
[03:17:39.300 --> 03:17:40.300]  They're two different nootropics.
[03:17:40.300 --> 03:17:41.300]  They go good with this.
[03:17:41.300 --> 03:17:43.300]  But this is the King Kong.
[03:17:43.300 --> 03:17:45.300]  This is the boss.
[03:17:45.300 --> 03:17:46.300]  TurboForce.
[03:17:46.300 --> 03:17:47.300]  Back in stock.
[03:17:47.300 --> 03:17:48.300]  Discounted.
[03:17:48.300 --> 03:17:50.300]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:17:50.300 --> 03:17:51.300]  More power.
[03:17:51.300 --> 03:17:52.300]  More strength.
[03:17:52.300 --> 03:17:53.300]  More energy.
[03:17:55.300 --> 03:17:59.300]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones.
[03:18:04.300 --> 03:18:05.300]  I want you all to know something.
[03:18:05.300 --> 03:18:07.300]  Alex Jones was right.
[03:18:07.300 --> 03:18:10.300]  Alex is right about far more than he's wrong.
[03:18:10.300 --> 03:18:13.300]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[03:18:13.300 --> 03:18:17.300]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down.
[03:18:17.300 --> 03:18:19.300]  Alex Jones was right.
[03:18:19.300 --> 03:18:23.300]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[03:18:23.300 --> 03:18:27.300]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[03:18:27.300 --> 03:18:30.300]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[03:18:30.300 --> 03:18:31.300]  Years ago.
[03:18:31.300 --> 03:18:33.300]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax.
[03:18:33.300 --> 03:18:34.300]  Not for a second.
[03:18:34.300 --> 03:18:37.300]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[03:18:38.300 --> 03:18:40.300]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[03:18:40.300 --> 03:18:43.300]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[03:18:43.300 --> 03:18:48.300]  That's why the globalists hate me is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[03:18:56.300 --> 03:19:02.300]  Right now, I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to Infowarsstore.com
[03:19:02.300 --> 03:19:05.300]  and gotten the great products that enrich your life,
[03:19:05.300 --> 03:19:08.300]  that empower your immune system and your body and keep us on air.
[03:19:08.300 --> 03:19:13.300]  I am humbly, hand in hand, talking to the viewers and listeners that have tuned in,
[03:19:13.300 --> 03:19:16.300]  many of you for years, and never gone to Infowarsstore.com.
[03:19:16.300 --> 03:19:22.300]  We know the vast, vast, vast, vast majority of you never actually go to Infowarsstore.com
[03:19:22.300 --> 03:19:25.300]  and never experience these great products and never fund the operation.
[03:19:25.300 --> 03:19:28.300]  Sure, you share a link, you share an article, you tell folks about the show.
[03:19:28.300 --> 03:19:30.300]  That's great and I thank you.
[03:19:30.300 --> 03:19:31.300]  But we need funds to operate.
[03:19:31.300 --> 03:19:35.300]  Plus, we've got really great products that do amazing things for people like our CBD oil
[03:19:35.300 --> 03:19:39.300]  and our fizzy magnesium and our sleep aid and our nitric oxide and our real red pill.
[03:19:39.300 --> 03:19:42.300]  Plus, all of these are really great products that keep us on air.
[03:19:42.300 --> 03:19:44.300]  Plus, you're missing out on having these products.
[03:19:44.300 --> 03:19:45.300]  So, get off the bench.
[03:19:45.300 --> 03:19:46.300]  Get in the game.
[03:19:46.300 --> 03:19:50.300]  Step to the plate and go to Infowarsstore.com right now
[03:19:50.300 --> 03:19:53.300]  and get these great Infowars products at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:19:55.100 --> 03:20:05.100]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:06.000 --> 03:20:16.440]  With you on the Alex Jones Show, I'm Kate Dally, your guest host from katedallyradio.com.
[03:20:16.440 --> 03:20:18.080]  So glad to be with you today.
[03:20:18.080 --> 03:20:21.360]  I'm sharing some research with you because some things were hitting me kind of strange
[03:20:21.360 --> 03:20:25.960]  and I wanted to share this with you because I thought it was, well, worth talking about.
[03:20:25.960 --> 03:20:30.240]  There's some things going on that are even deeper, I think, than strange.
[03:20:30.240 --> 03:20:35.440]  A couple of weeks ago, something really, really big happened and there wasn't a whole lot
[03:20:35.440 --> 03:20:38.200]  of reporting on it in the press.
[03:20:38.200 --> 03:20:46.040]  On March 30th, the Catholic Church revoked, renounced the Doctrine of Discovery.
[03:20:46.040 --> 03:20:52.900]  This was a really, really big deal because this had been in play for over 500 years.
[03:20:52.900 --> 03:20:56.880]  So it wasn't a small thing, we'll say that.
[03:20:56.880 --> 03:21:01.480]  And what they did was they pointed out at the end of their statement that they made
[03:21:01.480 --> 03:21:07.480]  in renouncing this Doctrine of Discovery, and they said the Church's solidarity with
[03:21:07.480 --> 03:21:12.520]  indigenous peoples has given rise to strong support for the principles contained in the
[03:21:12.520 --> 03:21:17.160]  United Nations Declaration of Rights on Indigenous Peoples.
[03:21:17.160 --> 03:21:23.400]  And they wanted to say that this that was based, this Doctrine of Discovery, and let
[03:21:23.400 --> 03:21:27.480]  me describe what this is, because your biggest question should be, why are they ending this
[03:21:27.480 --> 03:21:29.080]  now?
[03:21:29.080 --> 03:21:34.880]  The 500-year Catholic decree encouraged colonization.
[03:21:34.880 --> 03:21:40.800]  So what began as a religious decree in the 1400s then became the basis for legal concept
[03:21:40.800 --> 03:21:42.320]  in the United States.
[03:21:42.320 --> 03:21:48.120]  When the Doctrine of Discovery was invoked in a 1923, just after the inception of the
[03:21:48.120 --> 03:21:54.800]  country, US Supreme Court ruling that indigenous people had only rights of occupancy, not ownership
[03:21:54.800 --> 03:21:57.240]  over lands that they had long lived on.
[03:21:57.400 --> 03:22:04.000]  Now I just read that from something that is sort of spun a little bit, to paint the white
[03:22:04.000 --> 03:22:10.480]  Christian Bible-carrying person as the person that is the most evil person in the world
[03:22:10.480 --> 03:22:16.720]  that came in, and on this Doctrine of Discovery that started and originated with the Catholic
[03:22:16.720 --> 03:22:22.920]  Church, that this was the grounds for the taking of property in this country.
[03:22:22.920 --> 03:22:27.320]  Now what you probably should be thinking right now is, why did the Catholic Church
[03:22:27.320 --> 03:22:30.080]  just finally revoke this?
[03:22:30.080 --> 03:22:31.120]  What's going on?
[03:22:31.120 --> 03:22:32.440]  And what does it lead to?
[03:22:32.440 --> 03:22:33.440]  What's been going on?
[03:22:33.440 --> 03:22:39.040]  And I just said, over the last two years, there's been really interesting preoccupation,
[03:22:39.040 --> 03:22:44.720]  especially with this fake administration, on tribal, everything tribal.
[03:22:44.720 --> 03:22:52.880]  In fact, just in two years' time, they have written over 70 executive orders.
[03:22:52.880 --> 03:22:58.160]  It was one of the first ones they did in January, if you recall, one of their top priorities,
[03:22:58.160 --> 03:23:05.240]  memorandums and declarations on tribal, and talking about their sovereignty, and talking
[03:23:05.240 --> 03:23:12.840]  about how we need to open this up, and give them more land, and all kinds of things.
[03:23:12.840 --> 03:23:16.600]  Now what I really think is going on here is, I think the Native Americans are about
[03:23:16.600 --> 03:23:20.040]  to be used in a really big way, and I don't want to see that happen.
[03:23:20.040 --> 03:23:22.320]  And this is why I'm bringing it up.
[03:23:22.320 --> 03:23:24.720]  This is why I'm talking about this today.
[03:23:24.720 --> 03:23:29.320]  Because when it landed in the United States Supreme Court as part of a decision, the judge
[03:23:29.320 --> 03:23:36.440]  was about to lose property if he didn't go with the Doctrine of Discovery on the origins
[03:23:36.440 --> 03:23:38.620]  of the founding of the country.
[03:23:38.620 --> 03:23:43.980]  So what they're saying is, is all over, but especially in the United States, all we did
[03:23:43.980 --> 03:23:50.140]  was murder and pillage, and we took land from people whose land it is, and that this needs
[03:23:50.140 --> 03:23:54.420]  to have redress, and it needs to be given back.
[03:23:54.420 --> 03:23:58.580]  Very very strange language coming from Obama.
[03:23:58.580 --> 03:24:05.660]  In all of his eight years, he did 77 executive orders, directives, and memorandums.
[03:24:05.660 --> 03:24:09.900]  If you want to know what Trump did, Trump only did 19.
[03:24:09.900 --> 03:24:16.140]  Obama did 77, but in the last two years, the fake Biden-King fraud-a-lot administration
[03:24:16.140 --> 03:24:20.980]  has almost matched Biden's eight years in office with 70 of them.
[03:24:20.980 --> 03:24:21.980]  That's a lot.
[03:24:21.980 --> 03:24:22.980]  That's a lot.
[03:24:22.980 --> 03:24:23.980]  So what are they doing?
[03:24:23.980 --> 03:24:24.980]  What is the fascination?
[03:24:24.980 --> 03:24:26.100]  What's going on?
[03:24:26.100 --> 03:24:32.340]  So this goes back to 15th century, and it's the foundation of some of our property law
[03:24:32.340 --> 03:24:33.620]  today.
[03:24:33.620 --> 03:24:38.900]  And what's been going on in Canada lately, in the last year and a half, I'm going to
[03:24:38.900 --> 03:24:44.340]  talk about that, because you need to know what they're doing as a blueprint for, I think,
[03:24:44.340 --> 03:24:46.260]  what we're about to do too.
[03:24:46.260 --> 03:24:51.100]  So the Vatican renounces the 500-year-old doctrine, and I don't think, I think the timing
[03:24:51.100 --> 03:24:54.700]  is right on par for what they're about to do.
[03:24:54.700 --> 03:25:01.700]  I also want to say that in 2005, Ginsburg was noting on a case going back to the same
[03:25:01.700 --> 03:25:02.780]  exact doctrine.
[03:25:02.940 --> 03:25:07.220]  So this doctrine is integral in the formation of the United States.
[03:25:07.220 --> 03:25:09.660]  Are they going after the United States in order to gut it?
[03:25:09.700 --> 03:25:18.340]  So, let me say this, in 2007, the U.N. made a declaration for indigenous peoples that
[03:25:18.340 --> 03:25:22.580]  they wanted to see incorporated into international law, even here, even Canada.
[03:25:22.580 --> 03:25:23.580]  Okay?
[03:25:23.580 --> 03:25:25.340]  It was a big, huge push in 2007.
[03:25:25.340 --> 03:25:31.620]  Well, in 2010, they did a framework of dominance, this U.N. preliminary study on the doctrine
[03:25:31.620 --> 03:25:33.300]  of discovery.
[03:25:33.300 --> 03:25:40.300]  And this came out, and it really enforced the indigenous people need their land back,
[03:25:40.300 --> 03:25:46.840]  and we're going to even have to go to the lengths of undoing constitutions to get them
[03:25:46.840 --> 03:25:48.500]  their land back.
[03:25:48.500 --> 03:25:54.140]  It was a really, really strange, strange type of a document.
[03:25:54.140 --> 03:26:01.860]  It really painted the white, wealthy, especially white, white, wealthy Christian as the most
[03:26:01.860 --> 03:26:03.660]  harmful person on the planet.
[03:26:03.660 --> 03:26:10.340]  So a lot of this has to go to really kind of demonizing Christianity at the same time,
[03:26:10.340 --> 03:26:13.940]  because they are hell-bent on focusing on America.
[03:26:13.940 --> 03:26:20.940]  I guess no other nation conquered another nation in the history of us, right?
[03:26:20.940 --> 03:26:24.420]  But they don't talk about the European nations that conquered one another.
[03:26:24.420 --> 03:26:26.540]  They don't talk about all the others.
[03:26:26.540 --> 03:26:28.080]  They talk about us.
[03:26:28.080 --> 03:26:30.560]  We are their preoccupation.
[03:26:30.560 --> 03:26:41.920]  And the article, the study talks about this insane just zeal for making sure that things
[03:26:41.920 --> 03:26:43.840]  are undone from the very beginning.
[03:26:43.840 --> 03:26:50.760]  So Obama comes out, and he talks about indigenous recognition, and he did this a lot, a lot
[03:26:50.760 --> 03:26:54.080]  more than Bush, let's say, okay?
[03:26:54.080 --> 03:26:58.200]  And Bush was not all for making any sort of international law.
[03:26:58.200 --> 03:27:01.520]  I don't agree with a lot of the things Bush did, but they weren't, United States wasn't
[03:27:01.520 --> 03:27:02.520]  voting on it.
[03:27:02.520 --> 03:27:04.040]  They voted against it.
[03:27:04.040 --> 03:27:09.000]  But then Obama came along, and he did the protection of Native American lands and environment.
[03:27:09.000 --> 03:27:10.000]  This is key.
[03:27:10.000 --> 03:27:11.000]  Remember this.
[03:27:11.000 --> 03:27:13.080]  And environment and redress.
[03:27:13.080 --> 03:27:19.160]  And he said that we were such a terrible nation, we stole and stole and murdered and murdered,
[03:27:19.160 --> 03:27:25.400]  and we took this land, and it was going to be up to him to make sure that we had full,
[03:27:25.400 --> 03:27:31.200]  that they got full recognition of the lands, territories, ownership, occupation that otherwise
[03:27:31.200 --> 03:27:32.760]  they would have acquired.
[03:27:32.760 --> 03:27:38.640]  And that this declaration that Obama made further called upon the states to give back
[03:27:38.640 --> 03:27:42.480]  traditional lands, territories, and natural resources.
[03:27:42.480 --> 03:27:43.640]  Remember that too.
[03:27:43.640 --> 03:27:48.240]  Because as I come into the next segment, I want to talk about something people missed
[03:27:48.240 --> 03:27:51.840]  when Biden-Harris were running for office.
[03:27:51.840 --> 03:27:57.720]  They listed so many items that I don't think people really reported on at the time, but
[03:27:57.720 --> 03:28:02.320]  they were really sort of out there with, this is what we're going to do and why.
[03:28:02.320 --> 03:28:07.480]  So the natural resource rights are a really, really important key here.
[03:28:07.480 --> 03:28:13.920]  And they, and Obama said, under US law, they needed to function properly and facilitate,
[03:28:13.920 --> 03:28:20.760]  as appropriate, access, not only access, but giving their lands back.
[03:28:20.800 --> 03:28:26.800]  This was a really big priority for the Obama administration, but an even bigger one now.
[03:28:26.800 --> 03:28:32.520]  Was the timing of the doctrine of discovery, the ending of that after 500 years, why would
[03:28:32.520 --> 03:28:33.960]  you pick now?
[03:28:33.960 --> 03:28:38.560]  In the year 2023, that there is a definite reason for it.
[03:28:38.560 --> 03:28:40.480]  And I'll get to that in just a moment.
[03:28:40.480 --> 03:28:46.040]  But I want to talk about what Biden-Harris did in their proclamation for the presidency
[03:28:46.040 --> 03:28:47.040]  and what they were about to do.
[03:28:47.040 --> 03:28:48.960]  I'll be right back on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:28:49.160 --> 03:28:51.160]  I'm Kate Daly, your guest host.
[03:28:51.160 --> 03:28:52.160]  Stay with me on this.
[03:29:19.160 --> 03:29:23.520]  They went out, hired engineers, reverse engineered the fancy, best water filter system out there
[03:29:23.520 --> 03:29:28.720]  that sells for twice the price, and they made it as good in all the studies.
[03:29:28.720 --> 03:29:32.400]  It reduces things to non-detectable levels, thousands of chemicals, but you can go pay
[03:29:32.400 --> 03:29:33.400]  two or three times.
[03:29:33.400 --> 03:29:36.280]  There's four or five other filters out there that are just as good.
[03:29:36.280 --> 03:29:40.680]  We sell the very best, highest grade water filtration system for half the price of leading
[03:29:40.680 --> 03:29:46.480]  competitor and the media says we're bad and a cult for telling you you should filter
[03:29:46.480 --> 03:29:47.480]  your water.
[03:29:47.480 --> 03:29:48.680]  You should also filter your shower water.
[03:29:48.680 --> 03:29:51.720]  That's another way you absorb this crap, but I'm done talking about that.
[03:29:51.720 --> 03:29:54.200]  The point is, you can get the filters at Infowarstore.com.
[03:29:54.200 --> 03:29:55.200]  They're discounted right now.
[03:29:55.200 --> 03:29:56.200]  Finally back in stock.
[03:29:56.200 --> 03:30:00.200]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones.
[03:30:05.200 --> 03:30:08.200]  I want you all to know something, Alex Jones was right.
[03:30:08.200 --> 03:30:11.200]  Alex is right about far more than he's wrong.
[03:30:11.200 --> 03:30:14.200]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[03:30:14.200 --> 03:30:18.200]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down.
[03:30:18.720 --> 03:30:20.720]  Alex Jones was right.
[03:30:20.720 --> 03:30:24.720]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[03:30:24.720 --> 03:30:28.720]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[03:30:28.720 --> 03:30:31.720]  Alex Jones called this years ago, years ago.
[03:30:31.720 --> 03:30:35.720]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax, not for a second.
[03:30:35.720 --> 03:30:38.720]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[03:30:38.720 --> 03:30:41.720]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[03:30:41.720 --> 03:30:44.720]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[03:30:44.720 --> 03:30:49.720]  The reason why the globalists hate me is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[03:30:58.720 --> 03:31:01.720]  Humanity is in a fight for its very life.
[03:31:01.720 --> 03:31:07.720]  And Infowars for decades has been at the very forefront of the fight for a pro-human future.

[03:31:42.720 --> 03:31:46.720]  and I'm not going to sign any more after that, are exclusively available at infowarsstore.com as well.
[03:31:46.720 --> 03:31:49.720]  In the last month, I got a little busy, so I didn't sign the books.
[03:31:49.720 --> 03:31:50.720]  We didn't have them for sale.
[03:31:50.720 --> 03:31:52.720]  But now, I signed the last books. You can get them right now.
[03:31:56.720 --> 03:32:03.720]  If Alex Jones runs for president in the Republican Party, he has a chance of winning.
[03:32:04.720 --> 03:32:11.720]  If you just tuned in, you may be noticing I'm wearing an Alex Jones for president 2024 shirt.
[03:32:11.720 --> 03:32:14.720]  I am not seriously planning to run for president.
[03:32:14.720 --> 03:32:18.720]  This is an idea the crew had, to have a triggering shirt, kind of next level.
[03:32:18.720 --> 03:32:19.720]  Alex Jones was right.
[03:32:19.720 --> 03:32:23.720]  There's infowars.com on the back, Alex Jones for president 2024 on the front.
[03:32:23.720 --> 03:32:25.720]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[03:32:25.720 --> 03:32:26.720]  It's made out of really nice fabric.
[03:32:26.720 --> 03:32:27.720]  It's high quality.
[03:32:27.720 --> 03:32:30.720]  And it is an exclusive shirt to infowarsstore.com.
[03:32:31.720 --> 03:32:33.720]  And when the shirts are gone, they're gone.
[03:32:33.720 --> 03:32:38.720]  We're doing one run of Alex Jones for president 2024 shirts.
[03:32:38.720 --> 03:32:43.720]  And we'll have a historic memento, be able to spread the word, meet a lot of like-minded people.
[03:32:43.720 --> 03:32:45.720]  And you'll be able to keep us on the air.
[03:32:45.720 --> 03:32:48.720]  No way. No way. That's a bridge too far.
[03:32:48.720 --> 03:32:50.720]  That's no, it can't be.
[03:32:50.720 --> 03:32:52.720]  And I said on national television that he was going to win.
[03:32:52.720 --> 03:32:55.720]  At infowarsstore.com.
[03:32:56.720 --> 03:33:01.720]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order.
[03:33:01.720 --> 03:33:03.720]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:33:06.100 --> 03:33:17.340]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show, so happy to be with you.
[03:33:17.340 --> 03:33:23.020]  So the Doctrine of Discovery as it was written up in 1823 U.S. Supreme Court opinion that
[03:33:23.020 --> 03:33:27.580]  basically backed it and said the principle was that, this is what John Marshall wrote
[03:33:27.580 --> 03:33:31.440]  of the Supreme Court, the principle was that discovery gave title to the government by
[03:33:31.440 --> 03:33:36.880]  whose subjects and by whose authority it was made against all other European governments,
[03:33:36.880 --> 03:33:42.120]  which title might be consummated by possession, see that's what we're talking about here,
[03:33:42.120 --> 03:33:43.840]  by possession.
[03:33:43.840 --> 03:33:49.080]  And the exclusion of all other Europeans necessarily gave to the nation making the
[03:33:49.080 --> 03:33:54.480]  discovery of the sole right of acquiring the soil from the natives and establishing settlements
[03:33:54.480 --> 03:33:55.560]  upon it.
[03:33:55.560 --> 03:34:00.360]  Right now the big spin is to say, we walked in with Bibles and we said all the Native
[03:34:00.360 --> 03:34:06.080]  Americans weren't Christian and we conquered them, because that's really what it's about.
[03:34:06.080 --> 03:34:09.760]  And that, I would like to know if we interviewed everybody because I'm pretty sure Native
[03:34:09.760 --> 03:34:14.800]  Americans are Christian, but anyway, so they did it in a way that said that it was the
[03:34:14.800 --> 03:34:20.000]  white Christian male that came in with its Bible to massacre and that this Doctrine of
[03:34:20.000 --> 03:34:25.080]  Discovery gave them the right to do it and then consummate and possess the land.
[03:34:25.080 --> 03:34:33.000]  So Obama signed in 2010 at the same time actually saying, yes, the United Nations,
[03:34:33.000 --> 03:34:39.680]  we declare that their Indigenous Peoples Act, this is a wonderful thing, put out an executive
[03:34:39.680 --> 03:34:43.480]  order and I know you guys probably remember this, Stewardship of the Ocean, Our Coast
[03:34:43.480 --> 03:34:45.160]  and Great Lakes.
[03:34:45.160 --> 03:34:50.600]  And it said, drafted with substantial input from tribes, which established a governance
[03:34:50.600 --> 03:34:55.480]  coordination committee with three tribal representatives.
[03:34:55.480 --> 03:35:00.440]  And so they said their special interest priorities were going to be Arctic and developing coastal
[03:35:00.440 --> 03:35:05.200]  and marine plans and all kinds of things, but they definitely wanted them on board.
[03:35:05.200 --> 03:35:09.800]  Then millions of dollars in like, let's say the Department of Agriculture, Rural Development
[03:35:09.800 --> 03:35:15.640]  Office, all kinds of things were done in the Recovery Acts, millions upon millions upon
[03:35:15.640 --> 03:35:23.600]  millions of dollars given to secure Indian Reservation Roads Program.
[03:35:23.600 --> 03:35:29.360]  To me, it seemed like a lot of pandering, but the fake Biden administration, the deep
[03:35:29.360 --> 03:35:33.760]  state behind Biden, we know Biden doesn't really do anything, but it is amazing to see
[03:35:33.760 --> 03:35:35.560]  the amount in the last two years.
[03:35:35.560 --> 03:35:40.200]  And I know you might've noticed it in the news and maybe wondered what was going on.
[03:35:40.200 --> 03:35:41.960]  A lot of attention.
[03:35:41.960 --> 03:35:47.600]  The ACLU said support for the declaration is essential to upholding U.S. obligations
[03:35:47.600 --> 03:35:48.840]  under international law.
[03:35:48.840 --> 03:35:51.640]  A lot of articles have been written, lots of things.
[03:35:51.640 --> 03:35:57.400]  So two weeks ago when the Catholic Church revoked, renounced this, it was a really, really big
[03:35:57.400 --> 03:35:58.400]  deal.
[03:35:58.400 --> 03:36:02.680]  You guys remember I was, when we were talking about Indigenous People's Day, right?
[03:36:02.680 --> 03:36:06.480]  King Fratelli decided that he was going to do Indigenous People's Day instead of Columbus
[03:36:06.480 --> 03:36:07.480]  Day.
[03:36:07.480 --> 03:36:11.200]  There was much more to this than people really actually realized, I think.
[03:36:11.200 --> 03:36:15.360]  I remember just sort of making fun of it because it just sounds really, what's wrong
[03:36:15.360 --> 03:36:17.560]  with Columbus Day?
[03:36:17.560 --> 03:36:23.560]  But anyway, he did this proclamation and in it he said, we also recommit to supporting
[03:36:23.560 --> 03:36:28.640]  a new, brighter future of promise and equity for tribal nations, a future grounded in tribal
[03:36:28.640 --> 03:36:33.720]  sovereignty and respect for the human rights of the Indigenous People of the Americas and
[03:36:33.720 --> 03:36:35.600]  around the world.
[03:36:35.600 --> 03:36:41.160]  Not only do we have open borders with Indigenous People, claiming to be Indigenous People flooding
[03:36:41.160 --> 03:36:48.880]  in, we also have this onslaught of talking about sovereignty and talking about human
[03:36:48.880 --> 03:36:54.560]  rights, which is the two key words the UN loves, and also Indigenous People, right?
[03:36:54.560 --> 03:36:57.800]  And so everybody thinks, well, you know, they're just giving them something back.
[03:36:57.800 --> 03:36:59.360]  They're doing something for them.
[03:36:59.360 --> 03:37:04.400]  But in all these declarations, they're acting like they don't have anything and now we are
[03:37:04.400 --> 03:37:05.840]  here to give them something.
[03:37:05.840 --> 03:37:08.440]  It's really, really strange, right?
[03:37:08.440 --> 03:37:15.200]  This preoccupation with making us think that they're finally giving them what they're due,
[03:37:15.200 --> 03:37:16.600]  but it's not about that.
[03:37:16.600 --> 03:37:17.600]  It's not about that.
[03:37:17.600 --> 03:37:19.200]  I actually think they're getting used.
[03:37:19.200 --> 03:37:27.040]  So Biden put in this Indigenous Days People thing, the federal government has a solemn
[03:37:27.040 --> 03:37:31.320]  obligation to lift up and invest in the future of Indigenous People, and we're only talking
[03:37:31.320 --> 03:37:38.020]  about 3 million people, 8 million that claim partly to be Indian, but about 3 million people.
[03:37:38.020 --> 03:37:40.660]  That's a really small group, right?
[03:37:40.660 --> 03:37:44.580]  But man, there's a lot of concern over this, for this administration.
[03:37:44.580 --> 03:37:47.940]  So tribal nations, they said, are going to govern their own communities, make their own
[03:37:47.940 --> 03:37:48.940]  decisions.
[03:37:48.940 --> 03:37:49.940]  They already do.
[03:37:49.940 --> 03:37:54.780]  Anyway, it said, we must never forget the centuries-long campaign of violence, displacement,
[03:37:54.780 --> 03:37:59.020]  and terror wrought upon the Native communities and tribal nations.
[03:37:59.020 --> 03:38:02.620]  They're still going on and on with this lie.
[03:38:03.580 --> 03:38:08.940]  So they said, today we acknowledge the significant sacrifices made by Native American people
[03:38:08.940 --> 03:38:11.820]  and their ongoing contributions, blah, blah, blah.
[03:38:11.820 --> 03:38:15.860]  But here's the Biden-Harris plan for tribal nations, and I don't think anyone was really
[03:38:15.860 --> 03:38:17.980]  talking about this.
[03:38:17.980 --> 03:38:24.040]  They basically made this proclamation for equality for all, but the emphasis was going
[03:38:24.040 --> 03:38:26.180]  to be on Native Americans.
[03:38:26.180 --> 03:38:30.860]  And this was their own bullet points from their own website talking about what they were about
[03:38:30.860 --> 03:38:31.860]  to do.
[03:38:32.100 --> 03:38:38.300]  They were going to strengthen nation-to-nation relationships, provide reliable, affordable,
[03:38:38.300 --> 03:38:42.020]  quality health care, and address health disparities.
[03:38:42.020 --> 03:38:48.580]  Right now, they claim that the Native Americans are completely 100% boosted and vaccinated
[03:38:48.580 --> 03:38:50.660]  more than any other group.
[03:38:50.660 --> 03:38:51.660]  Isn't that strange?
[03:38:51.660 --> 03:38:57.500]  They made sure that these people were living in fear, and then they also made sure that
[03:38:57.500 --> 03:39:00.020]  they were getting all of these shots.
[03:39:00.020 --> 03:39:02.420]  That's a whole other thing I want to comment on.
[03:39:02.420 --> 03:39:09.660]  But going back to this document from the Biden-Harris, restore tribal lands, address climate change.
[03:39:09.660 --> 03:39:12.260]  See how those go in the same sentence, go hand in hand?
[03:39:12.260 --> 03:39:15.700]  And safeguard natural and cultural resources.
[03:39:15.700 --> 03:39:17.620]  There's a lot more to that.
[03:39:17.620 --> 03:39:22.060]  Ensure Native communities are safer and tackle the crisis of violence.
[03:39:22.060 --> 03:39:23.060]  That's a red herring.
[03:39:23.060 --> 03:39:27.300]  It really has nothing to do with that, but it looks like they're giving them something,
[03:39:27.300 --> 03:39:28.300]  right?
[03:39:28.300 --> 03:39:34.740]  Expand economic opportunity, but then they talked about elevating the number of judges
[03:39:34.740 --> 03:39:40.980]  that understand tribal lands, that understand tribal sovereignty in our court system, in
[03:39:40.980 --> 03:39:43.060]  the federal court system.
[03:39:43.060 --> 03:39:50.060]  They actually vowed to Biden and Harris to increase the amount of judgeships.
[03:39:50.060 --> 03:39:56.300]  They also vowed to put more Native Americans than ever at the heads of departments or in
[03:39:56.300 --> 03:40:02.340]  the Department of Interior or anything having to do with climate change, with lands, all
[03:40:02.340 --> 03:40:03.740]  of these things.
[03:40:03.740 --> 03:40:05.940]  It's really, really strange.
[03:40:05.940 --> 03:40:14.500]  So they made this declaration, and then Biden came out and said that 30% of the water and
[03:40:14.500 --> 03:40:19.740]  the lands in America would basically be theirs, right?
[03:40:19.740 --> 03:40:21.220]  Would basically be theirs.
[03:40:21.220 --> 03:40:25.620]  And it's really interesting because it's really about a land grab.
[03:40:25.620 --> 03:40:30.460]  So they wrote, we're going to nominate judges who understand federal Indian law, respect
[03:40:30.460 --> 03:40:33.740]  tribal sovereignty.
[03:40:33.740 --> 03:40:35.100]  Now think about this for a moment.
[03:40:35.100 --> 03:40:37.100]  They never did this before.
[03:40:37.100 --> 03:40:39.500]  Why now?
[03:40:39.500 --> 03:40:40.500]  Why now?
[03:40:40.500 --> 03:40:44.420]  Why in this two years is this becoming so important?
[03:40:44.420 --> 03:40:49.700]  And they also talked about how many roles they were going to put Native Americans in
[03:40:49.700 --> 03:40:51.120]  that understood.
[03:40:51.120 --> 03:40:56.400]  And they basically kept saying five, you know, Obama administration recognized and
[03:40:56.400 --> 03:41:02.000]  took 542,000 acres of land in trust for tribes.
[03:41:02.000 --> 03:41:08.320]  And when we talk about agenda 30, we talk about the future of America, if 30% or more,
[03:41:08.320 --> 03:41:12.360]  because I think that was a low calculation on their part so that people wouldn't talk
[03:41:12.360 --> 03:41:13.360]  about it.
[03:41:13.360 --> 03:41:18.200]  But he did declare we would lose 30% more land and waters to the feds.
[03:41:18.280 --> 03:41:21.320]  The feds are partnering up with the tribal nations.
[03:41:21.320 --> 03:41:27.040]  And that's what I'm worried about is that they're partnering up to take more lands
[03:41:27.040 --> 03:41:29.200]  in lieu of climate change.
[03:41:29.200 --> 03:41:33.080]  And so what they're doing is it looks like they're giving something to the Native Americans.
[03:41:33.080 --> 03:41:36.720]  It looks like they're preoccupied with them and really want to give back.
[03:41:36.720 --> 03:41:41.600]  But there's one thing I know about these people in these leftist loonies.
[03:41:41.600 --> 03:41:43.360]  It's always a bait and switch.
[03:41:43.360 --> 03:41:45.800]  It is never about true caring.
[03:41:45.800 --> 03:41:47.080]  It really is not.
[03:41:47.080 --> 03:41:48.800]  There's always a bait and switch.
[03:41:48.800 --> 03:41:54.600]  So their biggest objectives were Biden-Harris, protect natural and cultural treasures, and
[03:41:54.600 --> 03:41:58.600]  make sure and put as much land as they could under these things, respect land sovereignty
[03:41:58.600 --> 03:42:02.440]  and tribal rights, and protect Native homelands.
[03:42:02.440 --> 03:42:03.880]  It was this really big push.
[03:42:03.880 --> 03:42:07.320]  Now you're probably thinking to yourself, they've already done this.
[03:42:07.320 --> 03:42:08.320]  This was already done.
[03:42:08.320 --> 03:42:11.040]  Native Americans have their tribal lands.
[03:42:11.040 --> 03:42:12.520]  What is going on?
[03:42:12.520 --> 03:42:16.920]  When I come back, I want to tell you what Canada just did, because it's a really important
[03:42:16.920 --> 03:42:20.680]  sad state of affairs move on their part.
[03:42:20.680 --> 03:42:24.920]  And they keep talking about this bill that passed a year and a half ago and how they
[03:42:24.920 --> 03:42:29.840]  might have to change their constitution to accommodate the new international law from
[03:42:29.840 --> 03:42:32.360]  the UN on indigenous peoples.
[03:42:32.360 --> 03:42:34.080]  I'll come back and talk about that.
[03:42:34.080 --> 03:42:38.960]  But this, I tell you, there's way more to this than people are recognizing.
[03:42:38.960 --> 03:42:42.440]  These tracks are being laid and it looks like they're giving them something, but I think
[03:42:42.440 --> 03:42:43.440]  they're using them.
[03:42:43.600 --> 03:42:48.680]  And I think they're taking it for climate change in the name of of tribal nations.
[03:42:48.680 --> 03:42:49.680]  I'll be right back.
[03:42:49.680 --> 03:42:51.680]  I'm Kate Daly for the Alex Jones Show.
[03:42:56.880 --> 03:43:01.680]  They decided to not perp walking, not put him in handcuffs, not do a mugshot because
[03:43:01.680 --> 03:43:03.200]  they knew that that would help Trump.
[03:43:03.200 --> 03:43:05.480]  Didn't they know this would backfire?
[03:43:05.480 --> 03:43:06.980]  We were waiting for the mugshot.
[03:43:06.980 --> 03:43:08.200]  We learned today they wouldn't have it.
[03:43:08.200 --> 03:43:09.400]  So we've made our own.
[03:43:09.640 --> 03:43:14.520]  And it says political prisoner with an image of President Trump.
[03:43:14.520 --> 03:43:17.000]  The shirt is being printed now in Texas.
[03:43:17.000 --> 03:43:19.560]  It'll be shipping out to you in one week.
[03:43:19.560 --> 03:43:25.760]  Political prisoner with Trump on the front there in a mugshot jail background.
[03:43:25.760 --> 03:43:26.760]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[03:43:26.760 --> 03:43:30.920]  It says InfoWars.com on the back of the shirt.
[03:43:30.920 --> 03:43:32.240]  We also have Alex Jones for president.
[03:43:32.240 --> 03:43:33.560]  No, I'm not running for president.
[03:43:33.560 --> 03:43:36.000]  It's a really nice navy blue, high quality shirt.
[03:43:36.000 --> 03:43:37.000]  Red, white and blue.
[03:43:37.000 --> 03:43:38.000]  Alex Jones for president.
[03:43:38.600 --> 03:43:41.120]  It's a fun conversational piece and a limited edition shirt.
[03:43:41.120 --> 03:43:43.000]  Great way to fund the operation.
[03:43:43.000 --> 03:43:51.360]  So get your Alex Jones for president and Trump mugshot shirts at InfoWars.com or by
[03:43:51.360 --> 03:43:55.320]  calling toll free triple eight two five three three one three nine.
[03:44:01.760 --> 03:44:03.240]  I want to say brain force is great.
[03:44:03.240 --> 03:44:05.080]  I want to say turbo force is amazing.
[03:44:05.080 --> 03:44:05.760]  It is.
[03:44:05.800 --> 03:44:10.680]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[03:44:10.680 --> 03:44:12.000]  The fish oil is better than it.
[03:44:12.000 --> 03:44:13.800]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[03:44:13.800 --> 03:44:16.320]  Fish oil is liquid energy.
[03:44:16.320 --> 03:44:19.400]  Brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[03:44:19.400 --> 03:44:22.280]  Krill oils is the best and it'll give you the damn burps.
[03:44:22.280 --> 03:44:23.000]  And I'm just sorry.
[03:44:23.000 --> 03:44:25.080]  You want something like this, you don't get stuff for free.
[03:44:25.080 --> 03:44:27.000]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[03:44:27.000 --> 03:44:28.240]  It's so good in my view.
[03:44:28.240 --> 03:44:30.320]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[03:44:30.320 --> 03:44:33.240]  I eat five capulets of krill oil before I go to bed.
[03:44:33.240 --> 03:44:34.920]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[03:44:36.560 --> 03:44:41.360]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[03:44:44.040 --> 03:44:46.080]  So we don't make a big profit off of it.
[03:44:46.080 --> 03:44:48.720]  But, you know, as I just obsess, because whatever the best is, we've gone.
[03:44:48.880 --> 03:44:50.040]  I just can't lie to you.
[03:44:50.040 --> 03:44:51.240]  I just can't do it.
[03:44:51.240 --> 03:44:52.200]  You know, we're sore.
[03:44:57.000 --> 03:45:00.680]  If Alex Jones runs for president in the Republican Party,
[03:45:01.640 --> 03:45:03.400]  he has a chance of winning.
[03:45:06.720 --> 03:45:09.120]  If you just tuned in, you may be noticing I'm wearing an Alex
[03:45:09.120 --> 03:45:11.680]  Jones for President 2024 shirt.
[03:45:12.400 --> 03:45:15.080]  I am not seriously planning to run for president.
[03:45:15.080 --> 03:45:18.200]  This is an idea of the crew had to have a triggering shirt
[03:45:18.200 --> 03:45:20.280]  kind of next level, Alex Jones is right.
[03:45:20.280 --> 03:45:21.800]  There's Infowars.com on the back.
[03:45:21.800 --> 03:45:24.320]  Alex Jones for President 2024 on the front.
[03:45:24.600 --> 03:45:26.960]  It's a fundraiser shirt made out of really nice fabric.
[03:45:26.960 --> 03:45:28.200]  It's high quality.
[03:45:28.200 --> 03:45:31.200]  And it is a exclusive shirt to Infowars.com.
[03:45:31.560 --> 03:45:33.560]  And when the shirts are gone, they're gone.
[03:45:33.560 --> 03:45:38.600]  We're doing one run of Alex Jones for President 2024 shirts,
[03:45:39.040 --> 03:45:42.160]  and we'll have a historic memento, be able to spread the word,
[03:45:42.160 --> 03:45:46.000]  meet a lot of like minded people, and you'll be able to keep us on the air.
[03:45:46.200 --> 03:45:47.760]  No way. No way.
[03:45:47.760 --> 03:45:49.040]  That's a bridge too far.
[03:45:49.040 --> 03:45:50.680]  That's no, it can't be.
[03:45:50.680 --> 03:45:52.920]  And I said on national television that he was going to win.
[03:45:53.400 --> 03:45:55.760]  At Infowars.com.
[03:45:56.560 --> 03:45:59.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and War for the World,
[03:46:00.000 --> 03:46:03.080]  is a historic book that documents the globalists in their own words,
[03:46:03.280 --> 03:46:04.840]  plan for our future.
[03:46:04.840 --> 03:46:06.280]  That is a hellish future.
[03:46:06.280 --> 03:46:08.560]  Now, you'll always, while they still allow books,
[03:46:08.560 --> 03:46:09.800]  I guess they're starting to ban them,
[03:46:09.800 --> 03:46:12.640]  be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and War for the World
[03:46:13.000 --> 03:46:15.360]  at bookstores, Amazon or Infowars.com.
[03:46:15.640 --> 03:46:18.480]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book
[03:46:18.680 --> 03:46:21.240]  after the signed copies we got run out.
[03:46:21.240 --> 03:46:23.400]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[03:46:23.800 --> 03:46:26.760]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World,
[03:46:26.920 --> 03:46:29.080]  a signed copy at Infowars.com.
[03:46:29.160 --> 03:46:31.800]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser
[03:46:32.040 --> 03:46:33.160]  to keep us on the air.
[03:46:33.160 --> 03:46:36.200]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book.
[03:46:36.200 --> 03:46:38.800]  You'll also know that you help keep Infowars on the air.
[03:46:39.040 --> 03:46:41.240]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book
[03:46:41.920 --> 03:46:43.000]  or unsigned copies.
[03:46:43.000 --> 03:46:47.360]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to Infowars.com
[03:46:47.360 --> 03:46:50.160]  and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies
[03:46:50.160 --> 03:46:53.240]  and donate to the library or give them to the local school.
[03:46:53.360 --> 03:46:54.360]  This is an Infowar.
[03:46:54.360 --> 03:46:56.120]  I'm counting on you and thank you for your support.
[03:46:57.120 --> 03:47:01.120]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[03:47:01.120 --> 03:47:03.120]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:47:06.000 --> 03:47:19.140]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, I'm Kate Dally, your guest host from katedallyradio.com.
[03:47:19.140 --> 03:47:20.480]  So glad to be with you today.
[03:47:20.480 --> 03:47:23.320]  Look, I know this is going to sound a little crazy.
[03:47:23.320 --> 03:47:25.000]  We all know the climate change agenda.
[03:47:25.000 --> 03:47:28.640]  We all know Klaus Schwab said you're going to own nothing and be happy.
[03:47:28.640 --> 03:47:33.360]  Are they going is this administration quietly laying the tracks and going after putting
[03:47:33.360 --> 03:47:41.600]  people in judgeships, making sure that lands are returned from property owners to native
[03:47:41.600 --> 03:47:42.680]  tribes?
[03:47:42.680 --> 03:47:47.240]  If you live in rural areas, we all know agenda 2030 is about getting people out of rural
[03:47:47.240 --> 03:47:51.280]  areas and closer to cities where they can be controlled more.
[03:47:51.280 --> 03:47:57.680]  They've made no secret of this and they're doing a great job, unfortunately.
[03:47:57.680 --> 03:48:05.320]  Berkowski led a roundtable on native communities priorities for the 2023 Farm Bill.
[03:48:05.320 --> 03:48:10.760]  There's so much going on, I wouldn't even have time to give you the headlines.
[03:48:10.760 --> 03:48:16.840]  But the briefing room at the White House talked about a new era of nation to nation engagement.
[03:48:16.840 --> 03:48:20.920]  They keep using that terminology and they keep talking about advancing.
[03:48:20.920 --> 03:48:25.360]  This was from their own directive on the White House page, advancing equity and opportunity
[03:48:25.360 --> 03:48:31.720]  for all American Indians and Alaskan natives and help tribal nations overcome new and longstanding
[03:48:31.720 --> 03:48:32.720]  challenges.
[03:48:32.720 --> 03:48:33.720]  Right.
[03:48:33.720 --> 03:48:38.560]  Then they talk about sovereignty and advanced tribal self-determination.
[03:48:38.560 --> 03:48:44.080]  Part of the doctrine of discovery is self-determination to go to claim land.
[03:48:44.080 --> 03:48:48.120]  OK, they're blaming it on the white Christian with the Bible in hand.
[03:48:48.120 --> 03:48:52.440]  And that made us murdering thugs, which is why the leftists love to tell in history books
[03:48:52.440 --> 03:48:54.640]  as they've whitewashed our history.
[03:48:54.640 --> 03:48:58.760]  But what's interesting about this is that it says there's an opportunity to celebrate
[03:48:58.760 --> 03:49:05.160]  the progress they have made in new nation to nation era and map out plans to improve
[03:49:05.160 --> 03:49:12.000]  all these new outcomes for Native Americans and for the seven generations to come.
[03:49:12.000 --> 03:49:13.000]  What?
[03:49:13.000 --> 03:49:15.200]  Anyway, it's strange.
[03:49:15.200 --> 03:49:19.240]  This whole document is really strange and talks about the fact that they need their lands
[03:49:19.240 --> 03:49:23.520]  back and that America can have to has to do the right thing for human rights.
[03:49:23.520 --> 03:49:24.520]  OK.
[03:49:24.600 --> 03:49:30.800]  I'm not against anybody having what they need or whatever, but we live in a country where
[03:49:30.800 --> 03:49:35.840]  you work hard for it and you and you you you do it right.
[03:49:35.840 --> 03:49:40.160]  So government assistance is is strange to me anyway, that we would be a nation that
[03:49:40.160 --> 03:49:45.760]  would invite this type of thing in at every turn or claim victimhood to get that.
[03:49:45.760 --> 03:49:47.680]  But I think Native Americans are great people.
[03:49:47.680 --> 03:49:49.160]  I think they're good people.
[03:49:49.160 --> 03:49:53.480]  And I do think that they're absolutely being used in this through the Build Back Better
[03:49:53.480 --> 03:49:56.520]  Plan, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.
[03:49:56.520 --> 03:50:03.000]  There are so many reasons, I think, where the funding is now designated.
[03:50:03.000 --> 03:50:07.280]  There's lots of money flowing and it might seem like they're getting something for this.
[03:50:07.280 --> 03:50:09.120]  But I actually do not think they are.
[03:50:09.120 --> 03:50:13.200]  I could go on and on about all the monies given, Department of Interior, all kinds of
[03:50:13.200 --> 03:50:15.240]  things that they've been doing.
[03:50:15.240 --> 03:50:21.120]  But I do want to tell you that Canada passed a bill which is called Bill 15.
[03:50:21.320 --> 03:50:31.200]  This was Trudeau's vowed sort of, I now claim international law from the UN Indigenous Peoples
[03:50:31.200 --> 03:50:34.160]  Act as as an act now.
[03:50:34.160 --> 03:50:37.980]  And he said, we're going to have to might have to change our constitution and we might
[03:50:37.980 --> 03:50:40.300]  have to change everything.
[03:50:40.300 --> 03:50:44.880]  And the articles coming out said, yeah, this is going to get really messy, but we're going
[03:50:44.880 --> 03:50:50.360]  to have to do it in the name of climate change and in the name of people's rights or the
[03:50:50.360 --> 03:50:53.200]  Native Americans' rights to their lands.
[03:50:53.200 --> 03:50:54.320]  This was really strange.
[03:50:54.320 --> 03:50:58.920]  So they have been working behind, well, not behind the scenes because it's been out there,
[03:50:58.920 --> 03:51:03.240]  but grabbing lands and saying these are for tribal, these are for tribal.
[03:51:03.240 --> 03:51:08.520]  And by the way, remember, they're in partnership with the government.
[03:51:08.520 --> 03:51:14.180]  If we haven't learned anything yet, our government isn't isn't the most wonderful in promises
[03:51:14.180 --> 03:51:15.560]  or anything else.
[03:51:15.560 --> 03:51:16.560]  Right.
[03:51:16.560 --> 03:51:17.560]  But man, there's a lot of attention.
[03:51:17.800 --> 03:51:22.480]  Hunter Biden, Devin Archer, that worked with Hunter Biden, went to jail for scamming the
[03:51:22.480 --> 03:51:23.480]  Indians.
[03:51:23.480 --> 03:51:28.840]  Was that a representation of kind of what this entire deep state is trying to do right
[03:51:28.840 --> 03:51:29.840]  now?
[03:51:29.840 --> 03:51:34.560]  I really think that they're going after the underpinnings of the country.
[03:51:34.560 --> 03:51:37.180]  They're having a hard time changing our constitution.
[03:51:37.180 --> 03:51:39.920]  So they're going after the underpinnings of it.
[03:51:39.920 --> 03:51:42.320]  Did we ever deserve it at all?
[03:51:42.320 --> 03:51:44.640]  Did we ever deserve to come here at all?
[03:51:44.640 --> 03:51:46.960]  So that's what I think they're basically doing here.
[03:51:46.960 --> 03:51:51.120]  But they're also going to be doing it a lot in climate change.
[03:51:51.120 --> 03:51:56.480]  So they're developing plans in the U.N. declaration on indigenous tribes, all kinds of things
[03:51:56.480 --> 03:51:58.000]  going on with this.
[03:51:58.000 --> 03:52:00.600]  The Bill 15 was scary.
[03:52:00.600 --> 03:52:04.760]  The Bill 15 was scary because people were noticing and writing articles in Canada left
[03:52:04.760 --> 03:52:09.640]  and right on the fact that, wait a second, that something's going on here and we're changing
[03:52:09.640 --> 03:52:10.640]  our laws.
[03:52:10.640 --> 03:52:15.240]  In fact, there was an article written about how to dismantle the doctrine of discovery
[03:52:15.320 --> 03:52:18.080]  that was revoked by the Catholic Church two weeks ago.
[03:52:18.080 --> 03:52:19.080]  How to do it?
[03:52:19.080 --> 03:52:23.440]  And it was basically acknowledge, which we're seeing this administration, oh, acknowledge,
[03:52:23.440 --> 03:52:24.880]  acknowledge, acknowledge.
[03:52:24.880 --> 03:52:31.880]  And then we see this like, you know, we're going to have to change laws.
[03:52:31.880 --> 03:52:34.920]  We're going to have to enter these things into legislation.
[03:52:34.920 --> 03:52:41.160]  We're going to have to put judges in that will err on the side of giving lands back from
[03:52:41.160 --> 03:52:45.400]  maybe property owners that have it now or just absorbing so many lands.
[03:52:45.400 --> 03:52:47.000]  You know, the Tennessee case, right?
[03:52:47.000 --> 03:52:52.480]  The Tennessee case of eminent domain against the farmer for Ford building an EV factory.
[03:52:52.480 --> 03:52:56.040]  I mean, obviously, people are going, you've got to be kidding me on this.
[03:52:56.040 --> 03:53:00.780]  There's no way that could go through for eminent domain, giving it to a corporation.
[03:53:00.780 --> 03:53:05.320]  But we're seeing a lot of things like this in the news just recently in March.
[03:53:05.320 --> 03:53:10.080]  Indigenous environmental networks respond to Biden's climate change plan because in
[03:53:10.080 --> 03:53:14.440]  exchange, I think for all of these things that they're being given in 70 executive
[03:53:14.440 --> 03:53:21.000]  orders just in two years, memorandums and directives, are they having to go along with
[03:53:21.000 --> 03:53:26.480]  the climate change, all of this for climate change, right?
[03:53:26.480 --> 03:53:28.080]  So it's getting a little weird.
[03:53:28.080 --> 03:53:32.920]  So again, again, Trump only did 19 and I want to point that out.
[03:53:32.920 --> 03:53:36.200]  He also did some reversals too that Obama did.
[03:53:36.200 --> 03:53:39.960]  Obama did 77 over his eight years.
[03:53:39.960 --> 03:53:43.720]  Biden has almost matched that in under two years.
[03:53:43.720 --> 03:53:44.720]  That's crazy.
[03:53:44.720 --> 03:53:45.960]  That's insane.
[03:53:45.960 --> 03:53:49.820]  So we have all of these things going on, these little underpinnings, right?
[03:53:49.820 --> 03:53:54.320]  You're seeing a lot of shows like the show 1823, it casts every single person that was
[03:53:54.320 --> 03:53:56.120]  Catholic as evil, right?
[03:53:56.120 --> 03:54:01.160]  And murdering and just raping consistently the Indians in the schools that they were forced
[03:54:01.160 --> 03:54:02.160]  to go to.
[03:54:02.160 --> 03:54:07.400]  And yes, there was some forcing going into the schools and things like that under the
[03:54:07.400 --> 03:54:08.560]  guise of that.
[03:54:08.560 --> 03:54:10.120]  But not everybody was evil.
[03:54:10.120 --> 03:54:13.840]  But there's a lot of media that's pointing this out or trying to at least point this
[03:54:13.840 --> 03:54:19.040]  out to try to say, oh my gosh, we need to give this back and we really need to look
[03:54:19.040 --> 03:54:21.560]  at human rights and adopt international law.
[03:54:21.560 --> 03:54:28.000]  We also did the Indigenous Peoples Declaration for 2023 United Nations Water Conference.
[03:54:28.000 --> 03:54:34.400]  Remember the declaration Obama did for waterways, for tribal lands, for well, anything they're
[03:54:34.400 --> 03:54:40.720]  going to deem responsible for climate change will be done in the name of tribal.
[03:54:40.720 --> 03:54:43.340]  Mark my words.
[03:54:43.340 --> 03:54:50.240]  And also there was the latest, even this week, by the way, there's so much more I could say
[03:54:50.240 --> 03:54:53.320]  on this, but they did pass that in Canada.
[03:54:53.320 --> 03:54:54.660]  They did pass that law.
[03:54:54.660 --> 03:54:57.720]  And I think it's a blueprint for what they're doing here, actually.
[03:54:57.720 --> 03:55:01.520]  I think there was deeper meaning to the Indigenous Peoples Day Act.
[03:55:01.520 --> 03:55:04.480]  I think there's a lot more there than people recognized.
[03:55:04.480 --> 03:55:09.760]  I think it was a declaration and also a nod to get the, they were all waiting on the Catholic
[03:55:09.760 --> 03:55:10.760]  Church.
[03:55:10.760 --> 03:55:14.280]  Other churches had renounced it or revoked it, but the Catholic Church was the biggie.
[03:55:14.280 --> 03:55:15.760]  It was a heavyweight.
[03:55:15.760 --> 03:55:18.240]  And all of the sudden it's being revoked.
[03:55:18.240 --> 03:55:23.480]  But there was an article talking about this just in the press this week.
[03:55:23.480 --> 03:55:29.280]  JPMorgan Chase, right, Jamie Dimon, suggested that the U.S. government and climate conscious
[03:55:29.280 --> 03:55:35.040]  corporations may have to seize citizens' properties to enact climate initiatives while
[03:55:35.040 --> 03:55:38.960]  there's still time to stave off climate disasters.
[03:55:38.960 --> 03:55:41.560]  What a load of horse crap that is.
[03:55:41.560 --> 03:55:46.320]  But that comes from Jamie Dimon, so we would all expect horse crap spewing out of his mouth.
[03:55:46.320 --> 03:55:49.120]  But that was in an annual letter to shareholders.
[03:55:49.120 --> 03:55:55.640]  We'll have to take citizens' property in the event of this huge emergency for the climate.
[03:55:55.640 --> 03:56:01.960]  And I wonder how much of this will be, you know what, you live close to tribal lands
[03:56:01.960 --> 03:56:05.400]  or you live in a vicinity or a state that has a lot of tribal lands.
[03:56:05.400 --> 03:56:08.680]  Maybe those tribal lands extend and it won't be the fault of the Native Americans.
[03:56:08.680 --> 03:56:12.960]  I actually don't blame them in this at all or think ill will toward them.
[03:56:12.960 --> 03:56:14.720]  I think they're being used.
[03:56:14.720 --> 03:56:17.520]  I think they think they're getting something and they're being used.
[03:56:17.520 --> 03:56:22.160]  Eminent domain is going to broaden and it's going to broaden under this because obviously
[03:56:22.160 --> 03:56:30.280]  January 26, his first directive for tribal nations in 2021, very important to this fraudulent
[03:56:30.280 --> 03:56:37.160]  administration that they get these things passed, 70 is a lot in two years.
[03:56:37.160 --> 03:56:43.320]  Obama took eight years to do 77 of them, but there's definitely a reason the Catholic Church
[03:56:43.320 --> 03:56:50.520]  after 500 years just revoked this, giving that big nod to the UN to international law entering
[03:56:50.520 --> 03:56:56.480]  and creeping into our legislation if we follow along with Canada.
[03:56:56.480 --> 03:57:00.840]  And I think Canada is being used as the blueprint and I think we're going to see a lot more
[03:57:00.840 --> 03:57:05.640]  eminent domain in the name of tribal and I don't want to see the Native Americans get
[03:57:05.640 --> 03:57:06.640]  used like this.
[03:57:06.640 --> 03:57:07.640]  I really don't.
[03:57:07.640 --> 03:57:10.400]  But there's something going on here and it's not right.
[03:57:10.400 --> 03:57:14.920]  There's a lot of pandering going on and there's a lot of things that are adding up and it's
[03:57:14.920 --> 03:57:20.720]  just, it's kind of scary actually, because they're going after the foundation of America,
[03:57:20.720 --> 03:57:26.920]  the foundation, the underpinnings of how we declared this to be a country.
[03:57:26.920 --> 03:57:28.480]  That doesn't look good for us.
[03:57:28.480 --> 03:57:31.000]  And so we need to be fighting these things.
[03:57:31.000 --> 03:57:35.440]  We need to, we need to get together to fight this and I hope we see it now.
[03:57:35.440 --> 03:57:41.920]  I am Kate Dally from katedallyradio.com for the Alex Jones Show, glad to be with you today
[03:57:41.920 --> 03:57:45.680]  and thank you for listening to this latest research of mine.
[03:57:45.680 --> 03:57:46.680]  Thank you.
[03:57:46.680 --> 03:57:50.960]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[03:57:50.960 --> 03:57:56.160]  I don't think anybody can deny it and it is because of listeners and viewers supporting
[03:57:56.160 --> 03:57:57.160]  us.
[03:57:57.160 --> 03:58:02.640]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[03:58:02.640 --> 03:58:07.720]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight and when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen
[03:58:07.720 --> 03:58:13.120]  Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's
[03:58:13.120 --> 03:58:14.120]  really just incredible.
[03:58:14.120 --> 03:58:18.120]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[03:58:18.120 --> 03:58:23.920]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[03:58:23.920 --> 03:58:27.560]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us and that's wonderful, keep doing it,
[03:58:27.560 --> 03:58:32.440]  but most viewers and listeners never go to infowarsstore.com and you never buy great
[03:58:32.440 --> 03:58:35.880]  products that enrich and empower your life while at the same time keeping us on air.
[03:58:36.080 --> 03:58:40.080]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at infowarsstore.com.
[03:58:40.080 --> 03:58:44.880]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to infowarsstore.com, our funding problems
[03:58:44.880 --> 03:58:45.880]  will be over.
[03:58:45.880 --> 03:58:46.880]  Please take action now.
[03:58:46.880 --> 03:58:50.280]  I want to thank all of you over the years who have supported InfoWars financially and
[03:58:50.280 --> 03:58:52.280]  with word of mouth and prayer.
[03:58:52.280 --> 03:58:55.680]  All the success that we've had together against the globalists and the fact that we're not
[03:58:55.680 --> 03:58:59.880]  caught flat-footed during their major takeover is because of you.
[03:58:59.880 --> 03:59:02.280]  Humanity has a real fighting chance.
[03:59:02.680 --> 03:59:06.680]  I just want to thank you all for buying products at infowarsstore.com like books and films
[03:59:06.680 --> 03:59:09.680]  and supplements and water filtration, air filtration and so much more.
