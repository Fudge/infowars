[00:00.000 --> 00:13.560]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex
[00:13.560 --> 00:31.840]  Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones the ruling class
[00:31.840 --> 00:38.720]  that controls much of this club through fraud and disinformation praise every day that you
[00:38.720 --> 00:44.160]  be ignorant that you be stupid that you be so self-centered that you don't even care
[00:44.160 --> 00:48.880]  about what's happening in society to the point of where you will actually be enslaved
[00:48.880 --> 00:58.560]  and most probably destroyed they absolutely swim in the ether that is the ignorance gripping
[00:58.560 --> 01:06.080]  our world I look at the headlines with a former MI5 chief says the enemy is everywhere watch
[01:06.080 --> 01:13.800]  your neighbors extremist are everywhere and then they segue into nationalist right-wing
[01:13.800 --> 01:21.520]  patriot groups see they use the radical Muslims that they protect and shepherd and fund as
[01:21.520 --> 01:26.720]  the overall backdrop for the global war on terror but then meanwhile it's really pointed
[01:26.720 --> 01:33.320]  at people that know the criminal governments of the West are the big issue and that's hiding
[01:33.320 --> 01:39.320]  in plain view here in the United States they're saying you know brace for terrorists everywhere
[01:39.320 --> 01:44.320]  by the way they're tea partiers and conservatives and veterans and gun owners and libertarians
[01:44.320 --> 01:50.000]  and constitutionalist and it's the same thing over in the UK same thing in Europe but then
[01:50.000 --> 01:59.120]  meanwhile meanwhile John McCain if you believe it snuck across with a quote US force out
[01:59.120 --> 02:06.120]  of Turkey into Syria to discuss giving arms to the rebels and then met with a bunch of
[02:06.120 --> 02:15.560]  a summer bin Laden Qatari and Saudi Arabian Wahhabist I mean there he is with a bunch
[02:15.560 --> 02:25.520]  of bin Laden lookalikes with real al-Qaeda with the al-Qaeda brigade it's actually called
[02:25.520 --> 02:32.280]  the bin Laden brigade that leads the Syrian forces but when you fly and there's new videos
[02:32.280 --> 02:36.440]  on info wars.com and you don't want to go through the radiation machine to make sure
[02:36.440 --> 02:44.800]  you don't have a bomb on you they're going to need to look inside you know what South
[02:44.800 --> 02:51.080]  Park says and it's actually true it's all an act of domination to get their filthy government
[02:51.080 --> 02:55.440]  bureaucratic hands on you and even the idiots doing it don't even know why they've been
[02:55.440 --> 02:59.360]  hired to do this.
[02:59.360 --> 03:08.960]  Meanwhile Rand Paul is telling it like it is he's come out and said properly that our
[03:08.960 --> 03:19.760]  government and the US Senate is arming al-Qaeda but if you try to talk to the general public
[03:19.760 --> 03:26.280]  who's not informed about this they go listen to that he knows how to talk he's trying to
[03:26.280 --> 03:31.080]  show off to us he says the government runs al-Qaeda.
[03:31.080 --> 03:36.440]  Rand Paul's Senate is arming al-Qaeda and rushing to war in Syria that was last Friday
[03:36.440 --> 03:45.840]  got almost no attention said that on the floor of the Senate and that is a fact that is a
[03:45.840 --> 03:51.760]  fact and I just sit here and I guarantee you if I say to TSA hey this whole terror threat
[03:51.760 --> 04:00.760]  is fake the government runs al-Qaeda oh yeah right just listen to you.
[04:00.760 --> 04:11.840]  Right out of videocracy and it's a fact an oxymoron a fraudulent raging paradox hanging
[04:11.840 --> 04:18.720]  in front of our faces and now you've got multiple FBI agents involved in the so-called investigation
[04:18.720 --> 04:23.840]  of the Boston bombing dead you've got more Navy SEALs and SEAL Team 6 dying constantly
[04:23.840 --> 04:29.640]  falling out of helicopters being run over being shot being assassinated covering up the
[04:29.640 --> 04:35.600]  bin Laden hoax the killing of bin Laden covering up what really happened at the Boston bombing
[04:35.600 --> 04:40.040]  I mean they are so desperate in the Boston bombing that the media not look at it just
[04:40.040 --> 04:45.640]  just acting completely suspicious it'd be like if a cop drove by and somebody you know
[04:45.640 --> 04:50.240]  saw him and ran into the woods you know the cop would say well that's that looks like
[04:50.240 --> 04:55.680]  a reasonable suspicion of something here the government acts totally creepy totally suspicious

[07:07.720 --> 07:12.520]  led me to a well known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the
[07:12.520 --> 07:17.400]  United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost
[07:17.400 --> 07:23.040]  all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves

[09:13.120 --> 09:21.640]  to cover this today obviously secretly went to Turkey the big NATO command base and infiltrated
[09:21.640 --> 09:30.880]  into Syria if you even believe that in a grandstanding event and met with the leaders of al-qaeda
[09:30.880 --> 09:35.960]  as part of flaunting it in the American people's comatose face that they're heroes and need
[09:35.960 --> 09:43.600]  heavy weapons and then our so-called press then goes how dare Obama not have a full
[09:43.600 --> 09:48.720]  blown war when there is a full blown war and then that gives him left cover where even
[09:48.720 --> 09:55.840]  Obama in a two-plus year bombardment bombing artillery attacks fighter bomber attacks sixty
[09:55.840 --> 10:01.680]  thousand troops every few months rotated in and out at least that's a conservative number
[10:01.680 --> 10:07.840]  hundred and twenty thousand syrians dead war of aggression and they have the neocon chicken
[10:07.840 --> 10:15.080]  hawks running up and down saying how dare Obama the commie how about the new world order
[10:15.080 --> 10:19.760]  right their buddy these people are all hanging out together behind the scenes at that level
[10:19.760 --> 10:28.200]  of leadership ladies and gentlemen can then criticize him for not doing enough and McCain
[10:28.200 --> 10:34.120]  literally sneaks across and you know met with the opposition leaders and I saw video and
[10:34.120 --> 10:39.200]  photos of this and I'm going to cover it coming up later in the hour it was so degenerate
[10:39.200 --> 10:46.800]  with the so-called rebel leaders slouched like gang members in their chairs in a conference
[10:46.800 --> 10:57.360]  room in a captured city council totally and completely disgusting them sitting around
[10:57.360 --> 11:03.960]  the council room saying we are not happy with your government not giving us aid which is
[11:03.960 --> 11:09.360]  all a set piece to go we're not giving the darlings aid to fight the muslim extremist
[11:09.360 --> 11:13.720]  our public is so dumbed down I've heard them I know you've heard them on talk radio go
[11:13.720 --> 11:20.400]  we need to fight al-qaeda in in Libya and Syria when our criminal banker occupied government
[11:20.400 --> 11:26.600]  are the ones putting al-qaeda in and then using al-qaeda is the menacing threat to take our
[11:26.600 --> 11:31.840]  liberties set up a homeland security spy grid which in all the training manuals has nothing
[11:31.840 --> 11:38.080]  to do with muslim extremist it has to do with you and your farm and your ranch or your business
[11:38.080 --> 11:44.440]  and your guns and your children and how they're going to forcibly inoculate you it is the social
[11:44.440 --> 11:51.120]  engineer control freak nanny state that wants in your life all over the globalist controlled
[11:51.120 --> 11:56.280]  world that's every country but about 10 they've almost got global government in they haven't
[11:56.280 --> 11:59.720]  mopped up state governments within governments they haven't shut down all the free press
[11:59.720 --> 12:12.040]  here and there but they're very close and the goal is run your life the goal is control
[12:12.040 --> 12:18.000]  your life the goal is dominate you and your family that's why the exact same programs
[12:18.000 --> 12:25.160]  you see in germany are in australia are in the united states are in england are in canada
[12:25.160 --> 12:33.600]  are in wales are in scotland are in mexico because the globalist control the issuance
[12:33.600 --> 12:38.120]  of currency and credit and coming up in the next hour i'm going to spend some time on
[12:38.120 --> 12:45.640]  this scotland every child to have state guardian from birth that spies on the parents and
[12:45.640 --> 12:50.680]  that trains the child that the state is their parent and trains the child to report on their
[12:50.680 --> 12:56.640]  parents this is what communist china did when mal took over this is the standard program
[12:56.640 --> 13:00.920]  and of course who is seven times more likely to abuse a child in any other group worldwide
[13:00.920 --> 13:06.440]  government who gets into this type of work because they like to abuse children you know
[13:06.440 --> 13:14.480]  who god help us and then if you're actually poor and your kids are running around you
[13:14.480 --> 13:17.520]  know drinking sewage water in a third world country the globalist aren't there aren't
[13:17.520 --> 13:24.960]  any social workers but if it's in the west they target christians libertarians conservatives
[13:24.960 --> 13:31.040]  godowners people that have shining eyed children who aren't eating gmo and who aren't vaccinated
[13:31.040 --> 13:34.240]  that's come out in the training manuals we're going to cover this and cover it more the
[13:34.240 --> 13:39.560]  nightly news and throughout the week i want to show you what their plan is who they go
[13:39.560 --> 13:45.600]  after in fact it's in the australian news they're going to be germany is about as far
[13:45.600 --> 13:53.680]  advanced and this is any other country other than communist china and germany arrest homeschoolers
[13:53.680 --> 14:00.400]  arrest parents who try to homeschool children and then spins massive amounts of money in
[14:00.400 --> 14:05.320]  fact type in court rules german family to be sent back to germany homeschooling family
[14:05.320 --> 14:11.160]  to be sent back to germany it was in the news last week human events covered it and they've
[14:11.160 --> 14:21.360]  been here for three years upper middle class professional family with their children homeschooling
[14:21.360 --> 14:27.440]  they faced prison time or like and frank for secretly homeschooling and not going to the
[14:27.440 --> 14:31.440]  government facility to be turned against their family shot up full of deadly cancer virus
[14:31.440 --> 14:39.840]  filled shots and put through the eugenics operation and so they fled as political asylum
[14:39.840 --> 14:46.080]  seekers here and they are being sent back to prison their children will be taken homeschooling
[14:46.080 --> 14:53.280]  family who fled to us from germany faces deport deportation parents face charges and nine thousand
[14:53.280 --> 14:57.880]  dollar five for taking kids out of school as obama officials prepare to send them back
[14:57.880 --> 15:02.560]  yeah and that's a london that's a daily mail whitewash if you pull up human events it says
[15:02.560 --> 15:07.360]  they're facing i think it's five years in prison apiece and the state is licking their
[15:07.360 --> 15:11.320]  chops they're going to get to hurt those kids and hurt them bad and of course you've already
[15:11.320 --> 15:15.800]  got brain damage mindless idiot government workers even the ones that aren't pedophile
[15:15.800 --> 15:22.280]  control freaks and they just like to follow their orders and that's the model that is
[15:22.280 --> 15:29.520]  already coming to the u.s. and australian scotland every child to have state guardian now remember
[15:29.520 --> 15:37.760]  what msnbc said remember what msnbc said they said we've got a break in a promo we've got
[15:37.760 --> 15:44.360]  a break of the idea that your kids belong to you they belong to us in the community
[15:44.360 --> 15:51.160]  with this weird academic lisping woman most these people are so anti-life they don't even
[15:51.160 --> 15:59.000]  have kids your kids are their kids and that's where these people then get kids to adopt and
[15:59.000 --> 16:02.440]  then get paid to adopt them after they've run them through a ringer they take them from
[16:02.440 --> 16:06.680]  you and they get to warehouse them they get to put them on five or six drugs they get
[16:06.680 --> 16:12.560]  the power trip of wrecking a child a slow human sacrifice and by the way i've had social
[16:12.560 --> 16:19.440]  workers on the blown the whistle i've had people that have been foster parents enable
[16:19.440 --> 16:24.320]  tell you that the state is put them on as many drugs as possible if they raise their
[16:24.320 --> 16:29.280]  voice we get to put them on more drugs we're gonna you know we're gonna really all get
[16:29.280 --> 16:34.760]  rich off of hurting this kid i mean this is what it is and people are like oh yeah yeah
[16:34.760 --> 16:40.200]  human sacrifice that's pretty much what this society is that's what it's based on these
[16:40.200 --> 16:46.120]  are government the new world order is actually a society where the weak get to hurt the strong
[16:46.120 --> 16:51.920]  and the beautiful the secret of eugenics is it was created by inbred globalist royalty
[16:51.920 --> 16:58.200]  in europe and funded by the rothschilds and others and picked up by hitler which just
[16:58.200 --> 17:02.080]  shows their old birds of a feather that fly together and their lust for power and domination
[17:02.080 --> 17:11.280]  and control and they actually target just normal healthy human activity because it's
[17:11.280 --> 17:16.920]  a threat to them because they never had it and so they're going to destroy it and they're
[17:16.920 --> 17:20.440]  going to be the only people left standing and they're exempt from all the taxes the
[17:20.440 --> 17:26.800]  regulations i was seeing statistics this morning i'll get to it in the stack we're all over
[17:26.800 --> 17:32.360]  the western world they're raising the pay of government bureaucrats and it's just growing
[17:32.360 --> 17:38.120]  and growing that's the plan wreck everything transfer the wealth that's the program let's
[17:38.120 --> 17:46.280]  go to that clip of perry on on msnbc we haven't had a very collective notion of these are
[17:46.280 --> 17:50.560]  our children so part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids
[17:50.560 --> 17:54.360]  belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong
[17:54.360 --> 17:59.080]  to whole communities once it's everybody's responsibility and not just the households
[17:59.080 --> 18:04.680]  then we start making better investments the better investments off your labor 60 percent
[18:04.680 --> 18:11.040]  of your money in the u.s 70 to 80 percent in places like france it's not enough they're
[18:11.040 --> 18:16.560]  going to be people ask well how are they going to make us live in 200 square foot coffin apartments
[18:16.560 --> 18:21.280]  well mayor blumberg and also the mayor of san francisco mayor of new york and san francisco
[18:21.280 --> 18:27.120]  have said we're going to raise property tax until you're forced to live in this and then
[18:27.120 --> 18:32.480]  they will own the coffin buildings that you live in and then they'll land in their own
[18:32.480 --> 18:38.280]  private buildings that are you know 50 000 square feet for themselves but they'll get
[18:38.280 --> 18:45.080]  an exemption they all get exemptions bloomberg michael moore the head of general electric
[18:45.080 --> 18:50.480]  google they all don't pay taxes they don't pay in fact it's on record that when these
[18:50.480 --> 18:55.600]  really rich billionaires go at restaurants people've learned everybody kisses their
[18:55.600 --> 19:01.960]  butt because they're rich and then they don't give a tip that's on record like you could
[19:01.960 --> 19:05.400]  talk to waiters and people they'll tell you rich people you know the really rich they
[19:05.400 --> 19:10.800]  don't give you tips middle class does is they actually worked for where they got and they
[19:10.800 --> 19:14.840]  actually want to help people they have an instinct to want to help and build others
[19:14.840 --> 19:21.600]  up and create an economy the globalists have an instinct on a a oligarchal centralized
[19:21.600 --> 19:29.000]  instinct to wreck everyone and you will find out and don't feel bad though about the bureaucrats
[19:29.000 --> 19:33.440]  and corrupt police on their power trips they're all dead too they've all been implanted with
[19:33.440 --> 19:38.880]  cancer viruses into their DNA that are hormone a release when hormone levels drop they're
[19:38.880 --> 19:43.040]  all dead so don't I know they're hurting you I know they're squeezing you taking your
[19:43.040 --> 19:48.760]  kids wrecking you driving you into submission but don't worry they're all dead too it's

[25:12.720 --> 25:17.520]  are nanotech they're they're engineered viruses when i tell you that and we've done countless
[25:17.520 --> 25:24.160]  reports on that subject you might want to go look into that kind of like for 15 years
[25:24.160 --> 25:32.160]  i've been telling you that the plastics they've chosen will change your entire metabolic rate

[25:45.600 --> 25:54.480]  as well and then the media spends that that i'm being anti gay because it makes men sexually
[25:54.480 --> 26:00.360]  conflicted in their different glands like the hypothalamus it also does that to other
[26:00.360 --> 26:10.520]  species not just other mammals but other families of animals amphibians fish marsupials i mean
[26:10.520 --> 26:15.760]  we're having a giant medical experiment done on us and i've covered in the film in game
[26:15.760 --> 26:20.960]  i've covered it in countless reports that we've done here on eugenics food the ultimate
[26:20.960 --> 26:28.000]  secret you can look that up 25 minute long short film brain eating viruses you know brain
[26:28.000 --> 26:33.080]  eating vaccine i kind of use a shocking term to get people to watch the video all of those
[26:33.080 --> 26:40.200]  are out there with the proof of what i just said and then i sit there watching large minorities
[26:40.200 --> 26:46.160]  of the public of every race color creed religion waking up to this and who are inquisitive
[26:46.160 --> 26:55.240]  and informed and want a future and then i see other people who wear their ignorance
[26:55.240 --> 27:02.960]  like a suit of armor whose greatest possession is that they don't care and some of them aren't
[27:02.960 --> 27:10.440]  even some of them aren't even stupid they consciously believe that not caring about
[27:10.440 --> 27:19.080]  anyone but themselves and being nihilistic and only caring about that minute is powerful
[27:19.080 --> 27:25.400]  and puts them above other people and that same spirit that you see in the very worst
[27:25.400 --> 27:31.240]  losers because they're generally incredible unhappy losers who go around messing with
[27:31.240 --> 27:35.360]  people all day and playing weird games and they feel completely powerless and they're
[27:35.360 --> 27:43.000]  completely unhappy and they have hellish lives a devoid of honor the globalist are like that
[27:43.000 --> 27:49.600]  but are a little more sophisticated and i mean i'm here to tell you these people are
[27:49.600 --> 27:57.840]  not humans there's a six minute video upon info wars dot com where americans have forgotten
[27:57.840 --> 28:03.800]  the meaning or don't know the meeting i forget the exact headline of memorial day and yeah
[28:03.800 --> 28:08.320]  there it is memory hole americans no longer know what memorial day stands for and mark

[28:25.480 --> 28:32.560]  to find out what it is and because it's all about me me and these people don't understand
[28:32.560 --> 28:37.560]  that when other people have that attitude and they do you know at first when people have
[28:37.560 --> 28:42.160]  that attitude you might be able to get ahead at some level you'll end up being an unhappy
[28:42.160 --> 28:46.240]  person that dies alone but you might be able to find people that are stupid that you can
[28:46.240 --> 28:51.960]  cheat and manipulate and you might be able to monetarily get some symbols of success
[28:51.960 --> 28:59.400]  but those are those are those are garbage trappings the real wealth is friends and family and
[28:59.400 --> 29:04.720]  being honorable not that any of us are perfect but but you know trying to be honorable is
[29:04.720 --> 29:09.000]  the greatest wealth and and and getting to know other honorable people is the greatest

[34:10.560 --> 34:15.280]  to your calls and then I'll go back into all of this in more details but I do want to play
[34:15.280 --> 34:23.480]  a part of this mark dice piece you'll be joining us on the radio show tomorrow most listeners
[34:23.480 --> 34:29.080]  don't know who mark dice is a lot of you do though and some listeners are like why do
[34:29.080 --> 34:37.520]  you why why do you promote mark dice even though mark dice has attacked you before it's because
[34:37.520 --> 34:47.040]  I don't care mark does a lot of good work and so I positively reinforce that good work
[34:47.040 --> 34:51.680]  and I don't do it Pavlovian Lee on purpose but it's kind of like when an ice cream truck
[34:51.680 --> 34:56.480]  comes around a lot of kids get so excited because the ice cream trucks got good things
[34:56.480 --> 35:03.320]  in it and you know I saw in mark I don't know it's got to be now eight years ago when he
[35:03.320 --> 35:07.920]  first got started got out of college with a public relations media degree he went out
[35:07.920 --> 35:13.040]  and did really great reports so I pretty much to a great extent help put mark on the map
[35:13.040 --> 35:17.000]  but he was already doing great work he deserved to be on the map and then he went through
[35:17.000 --> 35:23.440]  his own personal stuff later I could I figured that and I'm not knocking the guy and and
[35:23.440 --> 35:29.240]  kind of went off into a bad area of his life it's like the prodigal son and when the prodigal
[35:29.240 --> 35:33.480]  son came back and the other son said I've done nothing to you father I've always been
[35:33.480 --> 35:39.920]  faithful now you're throwing a party the prodigal son he's done all this bad stuff you know
[35:39.920 --> 35:44.400]  to you but it's like hey think how much I love you if I'm doing this for the prodigal
[35:44.400 --> 35:51.280]  son because I don't think mark fundamentally is a bad person and it's like that with everybody
[35:51.280 --> 35:58.080]  it hurts me to see people that I know have potential destroying it and it hurts me to
[35:58.080 --> 36:04.680]  see a society that has so much potential I mean I took my son to exercise this morning
[36:04.680 --> 36:13.320]  and we got done exercising at Zilcher Park and I saw a bus pull up with regular kids
[36:13.320 --> 36:19.040]  they weren't special needs and I looked at these kids and they were clearly walking dead
[36:19.040 --> 36:26.520]  about a third of them because see when they hit you with GMO with every mammal species
[36:26.520 --> 36:32.440]  pigs guinea pigs rats rhesus monkeys you can look up the studies and they go back
[36:32.440 --> 36:41.600]  really 25 years with BT style that's the most popular you know corn and things that grow
[36:41.600 --> 36:47.440]  their own pesticides the first generation has a large IQ reduction increase cancer sluggishness
[36:47.440 --> 36:54.560]  also more aggressiveness sometimes it manifests depending on your genetic tree your genetic
[36:54.560 --> 37:01.680]  blueprint of the type you are and then by the second generation and generations about 20
[37:01.680 --> 37:12.200]  years humans tend to reproduce by about age 20 22 is the average I guess and we've got
[37:12.200 --> 37:17.600]  all of this you know garbage going on and I sit there and I look at people and you look
[37:17.600 --> 37:23.440]  at adults now that are one generation you know people are 25 30 years old under GMO and you
[37:23.440 --> 37:29.160]  look at the next generation people that are now 567 810 years old who were born out of
[37:29.160 --> 37:35.240]  the last generation my god man the next generation it's going to be and you can see the numbers
[37:35.240 --> 37:43.640]  the cancer numbers the neurological disorder numbers the infertility numbers it is parabolic
[37:43.640 --> 37:49.400]  it is a straight up graph and that's why they've got to get their police state control grid
[37:49.400 --> 37:56.400]  in first before the real death starts because you're going to have mad parents and they
[37:56.400 --> 38:01.920]  they they said 50 years ago in papers we've dug up and covered on air that they knew some
[38:01.920 --> 38:06.200]  of us would find out about this program I mean hell they write books the white outside
[38:06.200 --> 38:11.800]  czar does about jacking our food and water to sterilize us and this is the psychopath
[38:11.800 --> 38:19.960]  sociopath sadist party I mean it's fun for them to I mean I go out in public and I and
[38:19.960 --> 38:24.120]  I'm from a globalist perspective but against it and by globalist perspective I see what's
[38:24.120 --> 38:33.920]  going on I am horrified by it I don't even become enraged anymore I become very sick
[38:33.920 --> 38:38.800]  I can walk over to people that have an autistic child or two some people are so submissive
[38:38.800 --> 38:44.720]  they even when the first one gets brain damage and has a seizure in the second round of shots
[38:44.720 --> 38:49.760]  they still take the next baby in and do it they're so submissive and I'll say hi how
[38:49.760 --> 38:58.180]  are you doing so what's your son's name oh his name's you know David you know he's five
[38:58.180 --> 39:02.520]  years old I go I see he's autistic what what spectrum disorder is that oh why do you have
[39:02.520 --> 39:07.280]  an autistic child well I'm a parent I have an interest and I've done this hundreds of
[39:07.280 --> 39:13.880]  times the point of my wife and children say please please don't do it and and I will continue
[39:13.880 --> 39:20.760]  to do it because I care it affects me the only way I I cannot literally go hide you
[39:20.760 --> 39:24.920]  know in the in the in the mountains somewhere and turn everything off is I have to go try
[39:24.920 --> 39:28.840]  to help people not because I'm a hero folks I have empathy if they can target these people's
[39:28.840 --> 39:33.440]  children they can target all of us and they are spraying us and jacking the water and
[39:33.440 --> 39:38.160]  it's impossible to avoid all this stuff and Fukushima radiation levels off the chart on

[41:21.440 --> 41:26.120]  because I was getting out of line I was talking I was a human up there and then because the
[41:26.120 --> 41:30.240]  hiking bike trail was a madhouse is actually yesterday I say the weekend felt like yesterday
[41:30.240 --> 41:38.280]  it was a madhouse I've never seen it so busy even where I go and so I got down to the bottom
[41:38.280 --> 41:44.440]  of another hill came out by the creek and there was about 20 people down there and there was
[41:44.440 --> 41:48.240]  another pregnant woman with her friend and two other people because that's where all
[41:48.240 --> 41:52.040]  the yuppies are all those successful people all people think they're rock stars leave
[41:52.040 --> 42:01.320]  it to beaver folks and I'm sitting there and I stop and I start listening and they're
[42:01.320 --> 42:07.960]  having discussions yeah I'm not you know whatever you call it the term where you're diabetic
[42:07.960 --> 42:13.840]  because you're pregnant I mean I'm not pre you know pregnant diabetic or whatever the
[42:13.840 --> 42:19.040]  term is and they're talking yeah blah blah yeah that's our first kid blah blah and I'm
[42:19.040 --> 42:23.800]  sitting there listening as you pause by the creek to look at it for a few minutes before
[42:23.800 --> 42:27.600]  I went hiking up the next hill and I went well listen you better read those vaccine
[42:27.600 --> 42:33.960]  inserts you better read those vaccine inserts because they're gonna tell you there's no
[42:33.960 --> 42:39.640]  side effects but the vaccine insert will tell you it can kill your child and again these
[42:39.640 --> 42:43.240]  women had their husbands with them and they turned towards me because it's weird to talk
[42:43.240 --> 42:48.880]  guys talk about sports act tough hey weather's nice yeah I'm doing good yeah great working
[42:48.880 --> 42:53.040]  at the insurance company doing good yeah we're going on vacation here see I've I'm I've broken
[42:53.040 --> 42:59.640]  with this the normal behavior is I'm gonna go around in grocery store lines at restaurants
[42:59.640 --> 43:07.760]  I now get up at restaurants and I walk over to people's tables that's what I do now and
[43:07.760 --> 43:10.800]  I'm gonna do it everywhere and let me tell you something if you start doing that we'll
[43:10.800 --> 43:16.400]  break their back if you just start not watching television and inviting your neighbors over
[43:16.400 --> 43:22.160]  for a barbecue if you just start spending time with your family if you just start not
[43:22.160 --> 43:27.280]  eating GMO we will take over the market and break the back of the GMOs and they know that
[43:27.280 --> 43:31.600]  they're even crying uncle right now on Santos freaking out right now and again I was gonna
[43:31.600 --> 43:36.160]  get into some other subjects my point is I have total empathy for humanity I love humanity
[43:36.160 --> 43:43.200]  I love our art our literature I want to support the better attributes of humanity and and
[43:43.200 --> 43:49.240]  I get up here with all this news our government funding Al Qaeda McCain going to meet with
[43:49.240 --> 43:55.080]  Al Qaeda Rand Paul coming out and saying you know we're funding Al Qaeda the emperor has
[43:55.080 --> 44:01.000]  no clothes God God bless Rand Paul you know he's played a little politics with them but
[44:01.000 --> 44:04.320]  he's playing them not the other way around and they know that that's why the neocons
[44:04.320 --> 44:10.080]  in the liberal sating God bless him and I've got all this other NSA news I've got Scotland
[44:10.080 --> 44:14.640]  saying every child have a state guardian who reports on the parents you're all guilty until
[44:14.640 --> 44:18.440]  your family's destroyed it's not guilty until proven innocent and you're no longer innocent
[44:18.440 --> 44:22.600]  until proven guilty you're guilty until we kill you we're gonna suck everything out of
[44:22.600 --> 44:26.800]  you and then we're gonna blow you away and of course the little mind-numbed brainwashed
[44:26.800 --> 44:31.080]  minions of the system they don't know that they're on a power trip of running other people's
[44:31.080 --> 44:37.760]  lives when they can't even run their own I've got all this news I've got your calls I'm
[44:37.760 --> 44:42.680]  gonna get to everybody it's just that if you want to know where I met it's the eugenics
[44:42.680 --> 44:47.920]  it is the artificial environment they're trying to build for us and it's that I can't sit
[44:47.920 --> 44:56.440]  there and walk down the street and see a family and instantly see their children with a million
[44:56.440 --> 45:01.680]  miles stare and and see their kid you're staring at the ground and see them and go oh was your
[45:01.680 --> 45:05.880]  child autistic they're like yeah how do you know well I mean and a lot of times they'll
[45:05.880 --> 45:12.680]  have pairs of them and they go they tell us it's genetic yeah yeah it is genetic there
[45:12.680 --> 45:16.920]  are some people who can be shot in the heart and survive because genetically they've got
[45:16.920 --> 45:22.280]  extra arteries extra connections extra electrical impulses they're really tough but it's the
[45:22.280 --> 45:28.440]  bullet through the heart that would kill you know 99 out of 100 but not some people like
[45:28.440 --> 45:34.520]  Rasputin you know air you know in the in the in the czar court it took them like an hour
[45:34.520 --> 45:40.400]  to killing some people got thicker skulls some people you can't knock them out because genetically
[45:40.400 --> 45:44.600]  how they're wired there and and how their bone structure set up you got to bash their
[45:44.600 --> 45:48.720]  brains out to knock them out other people you can knock them out they got a glass chin
[45:48.720 --> 45:53.320]  but it isn't that it isn't that you have genetics of a glass chin why you're knocked out it's
[45:53.320 --> 45:57.560]  because you were punched in the chin you're getting cancer you should be getting it when
[45:57.560 --> 46:03.440]  you're 90 years old and you've had the replication of your cells not when you're 15 you've been
[46:03.440 --> 46:13.560]  put in an environment that is now accessing your genetics and causing the mutations and
[46:13.560 --> 46:18.920]  I just realized that's everything and I'm gonna tell my whole crew all of them I want
[46:18.920 --> 46:24.080]  to go into the GMOs I want to go into the admissions of diet injections injunctions
[46:24.080 --> 46:27.920]  like Bertrand Russell talked about the brain damage and dumb down the public I want to
[46:27.920 --> 46:33.360]  just constantly beat the drum of the thousands of Harvard and Stanford studies and and and
[46:33.360 --> 46:38.560]  Oxford studies and you know about sodium fluoride what it does to the brain and and you know
[46:38.560 --> 46:46.480]  what they're doing I want to hammer how they've done this to us because we're seen as a plague
[46:46.480 --> 46:54.320]  and we're being soft killed we're being dumbed down ahead of the larger cult because we have
[46:54.320 --> 47:06.560]  to have a break with the globalist they never want people to come to the realization that
[47:06.560 --> 47:10.640]  this is going on that's why they don't want to talk about how we give $85 million a month
[47:10.640 --> 47:15.200]  to foreign banks and Congress won't be told who totally illegal totally unconstitutional
[47:15.200 --> 47:21.240]  treason a thousand times over the chart they they go so overboard on purpose because it
[47:21.240 --> 47:27.040]  works they fund Al-Qaeda publicly to commit war crimes all over the world and then invade
[47:27.040 --> 47:32.800]  the countries to get rid of the Al-Qaeda they put in but then don't even go after the Al-Qaeda
[47:32.800 --> 47:38.120]  that should go after innocent people and that's so over the top they get away with it it's
[47:38.120 --> 47:42.640]  so over the top to have hundreds hundreds of FBI training manuals that are sent out
[47:42.640 --> 47:48.560]  to barber shops hardware stores gun shops say hundreds it's over 200 last year put out to
[47:48.560 --> 47:53.600]  every type of business there is tailored to them on what to look for and it's it makes
[47:53.600 --> 47:58.520]  everything an act of terror or terror so that everyone can be seen as a terrorist to create
[47:58.520 --> 48:04.240]  a total culture of paranoia instead of being concerned about the government historically
[48:04.240 --> 48:10.440]  that's the real danger and is running the terrorist common sense founding fathers world
[48:10.440 --> 48:15.560]  history oh no the government didn't do anything wrong they're not corrupt that's a conspiracy
[48:15.560 --> 48:25.040]  theory how crazy Alex Jones is it's your neighbor you can't trust over the top two billion
[48:25.040 --> 48:30.800]  bullets paper targets of five year olds they're training to kill even when the company comes
[48:30.800 --> 48:40.520]  out and admits it's real never hits the news 7000 just last year 7300 anti-mine heavy
[48:40.520 --> 48:47.640]  armored vehicles training for war with us and while they tell us the enemies everywhere
[48:47.640 --> 48:56.120]  the muslim extremists when they run them all of this all of this is just over the top cuckoo
[48:56.120 --> 49:02.280]  land then I see a video we will play the next segment then calls next hour and then news
[49:02.280 --> 49:09.520]  when I get to everybody Sheila I love the name Sheila I like an Australian I call women's
[49:09.520 --> 49:20.800]  Sheila's period Jason Mark Julio Samson and others we're gonna get to all of you but I
[49:20.800 --> 49:26.800]  just want humanity to make it I want us to really work together and be honorable instead
[49:26.800 --> 49:33.680]  the general public has taken on the attitude of not caring about anybody getting ahead
[49:33.680 --> 49:40.760]  it is a disaster just a bunch of self-centered egotistical people that have never even faced
[49:40.760 --> 49:50.160]  real challenges having no idea how the rest of the world lives or what our ancestors have
[49:50.160 --> 49:54.240]  gone through to take us to this point and then the very worst of us are in control because
[49:54.240 --> 50:03.120]  they cravenly crave it and not recognizing like you're negative no I'm not I'm positive
[50:03.120 --> 50:07.880]  and by not recognizing the great evil we allow it to take over and look at the articles in
[50:07.880 --> 50:16.240]  infowars.com national broadcaster refuses to cover Bilderberg meeting sin John McCain

[55:10.720 --> 55:17.120]  hour after we go to your phone calls that I was just mentioning with people almost every person
[55:17.120 --> 55:22.000]  mark guys talked to not knowing what memorial day was and so even though there's people that are
[55:22.000 --> 55:27.280]  misguided and think war is patriotic at least they know what it is and are just misguided
[55:27.280 --> 55:32.880]  what about the trendies of this world who know how to act cool and dress like television says
[55:32.880 --> 55:41.680]  but do not have any idea don't even have the the slightest inkling of what a major holiday is let's
[55:41.680 --> 55:50.400]  go to part of this clip what is memorial day for um what is memorial day for just you what's
[55:50.400 --> 56:01.120]  memorial day for um wow people are victims about it um what is memorial day the global is take
[56:01.120 --> 56:05.440]  one look at these people folks these folks have been drinking fluoride to guarantee that guys had
[56:05.440 --> 56:11.760]  all the vaccines what is memorial day for i don't know i don't know i don't know are you going to
[56:11.760 --> 56:18.000]  be barbecuing and celebrating yeah look at my buddies these are the people that are going to vote
[56:18.000 --> 56:24.160]  to take our guns and take us their slaves they will vote i don't even know don't even know no i don't
[56:24.160 --> 56:30.320]  know memorial days man it's the big holiday it's like the kickoff to summer when you barbecue and
[56:31.040 --> 56:35.280]  get drunk and stuff i don't think people from chicago celebrate that thing man they don't
[56:35.280 --> 56:40.480]  celebrate memorial day no they're all ruthless dude it's just i did call it California celebration

[56:44.800 --> 56:52.240]  is and they're rightfully kind of mad at dice like it should be like because he starts saying
[56:52.240 --> 56:55.840]  obnoxious stuff on purpose but but the point is that they think he's serious so they get mad
[56:55.840 --> 57:01.920]  saying memorial day is a surfing holiday that video is up on info wars dot com but that's why
[57:01.920 --> 57:07.200]  we're in so much trouble the government runs al-qaeda publicly and then they have rachel madal go

[01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:41.120]  i have with you um the smart meters are part of the infrastructure of wireless technology that
[01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:44.880]  really got in our homes back in the 1980s with the cordless phones with the antennas that pulled
[01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:50.160]  out well as these things so convenient these personal devices like our cordless home phones
[01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:56.640]  baby monitors and wi-fi as well as these smart meters emit 900 million waves per second so
[01:01:56.640 --> 01:02:02.640]  everything you've been talking about this morning regarding autism uh the uh influence of gmo's on
[01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:08.800]  our digestive no they've done university studies you put um fish near a router or plants you name it
[01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:13.520]  and ends up uh making the plants not grow as fast or not germinate and ends up making the
[01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:19.760]  fish mentally retarded but that's that's a good thing government loves us well the thing is the
[01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:25.520]  personal devices your cordless phone baby monitors etc were designed to service your home radius
[01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:30.800]  these smart meters are set up to cover square miles of penetration of these frequencies
[01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:34.720]  however they've been linked to cancer and death what's wrong with that are you an extremist

[01:13:51.120 --> 01:13:59.920]  i mean the whole time and it just hit me during the break i had forgotten about that
[01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:03.200]  and i guess you know harry is the head of the water department unless you're like a six foot
[01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:08.960]  four really mean looking redneck and the black guys were like black rednecks the point was
[01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:16.000]  is that i mean it felt good and then i just was in a daze and would hard and then we had listeners
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:22.400]  and i wasn't seeing where i was until the day i left every day about five six seven people i would
[01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:26.800]  would like be in the bar downstairs looking for anyone like guys with their wives and people with
[01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:32.080]  their kids and people from little rock drove in america is starting to awaken is what i'm telling
[01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:38.480]  and you know why the arkansas people were so mad they voted three years ago
[01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:45.600]  at all these different county and city levels to take the fluoride out
[01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:52.240]  you can look this up and then last year they passed the state law via federal funding
[01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:58.080]  to forcibly put hydrofluorosilic acid and everything else that comes with it upwards
[01:14:58.080 --> 01:15:02.320]  of 350 chemicals some are only 100 something it depends where you get it some of it's from
[01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:08.000]  florida montana china mongolia they mined phosphates for fertilizer you can mine into
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:15.120]  limestone deposits and find the different things that plants need and it's not brando
[01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:21.440]  electrolytes to quote idiocracy and they go in there and but it's full of toxic waste you've
[01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:26.720]  got to purify it out well the stuff that's left radioactive isotopes you name it is put in our
[01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:32.880]  water and everybody always knew this and i was talking to these guys are like i've been listening
[01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:36.800]  to you for 15 years and finally people are listening let me tell you two years ago that
[01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:42.000]  harvard study really helped and blah blah blah that's when we finally and you know i just remembered
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:47.040]  why i didn't tell anybody this because i had a thought after happening like 50 times that wait
[01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:52.880]  if i talk about this see nobody's perfect the feds will know about it but they already know
[01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:58.160]  and then they'll come around snooping but you know what i just had the split second understanding
[01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:04.800]  good go mess with the rednecks even more send feds in to harass them to poison their families
[01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:11.200]  they know this stuff is roach poison they know it's killing people and and some of them were
[01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:16.240]  telling me yeah my wife's got cancer she's only 40 i wanted i i don't know when the shooting war
[01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:21.040]  is going to start but i'm getting serious people i mean i mean just keep pushing it new world order
[01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:30.400]  that's all i got to say to you because i totally and completely forgot that i had my hand shook off
[01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:36.880]  of me and by the way i was staying on the other end of town mile like five miles away from where
[01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:41.920]  the convention was i would walk down the street with my children and run into the water people
[01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:48.400]  when they were out at night and stuff and so again ladies and gentlemen the globalist or spinal
[01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:54.240]  stuff they know how awake america is that's why they're panicking because no one wants to kill
[01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:58.960]  their kids it doesn't help your teeth putting that in the water and it's not calcium fluoride you need
[01:16:58.960 --> 01:17:05.200]  some of for your teeth you need some calcium fluoride it's natural they go it's natural
[01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:10.640]  that's like saying you know you need some lead it's natural and then shooting somebody in the
[01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:19.280]  head and going what i gave you your lead supplement you've all heard the analogy of drinking
[01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:25.680]  sunscreen so you don't burn your skin drinking it for your teeth my dad is a dentist by the way
[01:17:25.680 --> 01:17:29.600]  and if you wanted he'll give it to you but he's convinced about the fluoride
[01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:35.120]  because it's toxic waste ladies and gentlemen it's not even a regular fluoride now this lady
[01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:40.560]  called in uh shila and she was involved she says and all this she told us about it as towns say no
[01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:45.760]  signs of rising resistance of smart meters all over the country they they radiate you
[01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:51.280]  they spy on you and they go you're just against technology we don't have to go out and you know
[01:17:51.280 --> 01:17:59.280]  meter read anymore no you bragged you you think we're so dumb you bragged we know you're spying
[01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:06.000]  on us it's a robot an imperial probe droid attached to the side of your house sending back information
[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:11.440]  to the globalists that make Darth Vader look like a choir boy uh going back to uh shila shila uh

[01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:07.600]  me attached to my house send a person which notice this also gets the issue of how
[01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:12.640]  we need to decide the future of humanity together not have the globalists who think
[01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:18.480]  we're scum decided where they're using robots and computers to replace us on purpose it's not
[01:19:18.480 --> 01:19:23.920]  like we're a lobby saying don't get rid of horse and carriages they're trying to just set up a system
[01:19:23.920 --> 01:19:30.160]  that makes us obsolete we need to build a civilization where humans are needed and are not obsolete i'm

[01:23:58.240 --> 01:24:17.120]  we're back live i'm your host Alex Jones by the way a smart meter is a master control system
[01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:21.040]  that ties into all the other electronics another way they're sneaking this in
[01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:28.240]  is smart house systems where you actually bring the Trojan horse in yourself and pay for it
[01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:34.320]  and again these technologies wouldn't be bad if the globalist weren't engineering it to be
[01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:44.000]  oppressive but here is new york times associated press source fed news dot com all of it look at
[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:48.880]  this connect is always listening on your xbox one we reported this two years ago
[01:24:48.880 --> 01:24:55.760]  but privacy is a top priority for microsoft what a joke and it says well if you have it set to
[01:24:55.760 --> 01:25:01.360]  high privacy it only gives the cpu enough power to spy on certain keywords but uh if you really
[01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:04.960]  want to have it you know face scan you when you enter the room and basically talk to you you've
[01:25:04.960 --> 01:25:08.800]  got to have it on the other setting so you're not allowed to not have it spy on you remember i
[01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:13.680]  told you 10 years ago that google had patents to watch everything you're doing over the camera
[01:25:13.680 --> 01:25:21.840]  and microphone and sell it to the nsa oh yeah right now it's just out in the open xbox one is watching
[01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:31.200]  you and there's no way to turn it off and you're not allowed to play unless it's online and then
[01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:38.720]  you go pay to bring it into your house and then they have the ci director going yeah we're watching
[01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:44.320]  everything you do without warrants don't listen to that kook alex jones though
[01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:51.840]  just like it's mainstream news that mccain met with well hobbyists that actually wear al-qaeda
[01:25:51.840 --> 01:25:59.680]  uniforms and fly al-qaeda flags demanding more taxpayer money to them but you're a
[01:25:59.680 --> 01:26:03.600]  tractive wife because that's we've we've done studies you've seen in the news that's who they're
[01:26:03.600 --> 01:26:11.280]  going to pull she's going to get grubbed man by guys that and women because the women you know the
[01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:16.560]  ones that like doing that are people that like to force something on someone can you imagine that
[01:26:17.920 --> 01:26:24.160]  only in america they're going to have to look inside your underwear there's a new video out
[01:26:24.160 --> 01:26:29.200]  one of our activists where they're grabbing on her she says don't touch me there and they of course do
[01:26:29.200 --> 01:26:33.840]  because that's why they want that job i mean any in the old days you go to a park and do that you
[01:26:33.840 --> 01:26:39.600]  go to jail if you're one of those type of people but now now you get to wear a uniform and because
[01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:51.280]  of al-qaeda oh man works great doesn't it drink your fluoride folks drink your fluoride okay uh
[01:26:51.280 --> 01:26:56.720]  sheila make your point about what you guys did getting rid of the smart meters in uh your area
[01:26:56.720 --> 01:27:04.400]  of texas has reported on by the new york times well alex um finding texas local government code
[01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:10.960]  nine dot oh four was of itself a battle uh this started out in october when our city council
[01:27:10.960 --> 01:27:16.720]  indebted our small community 2.5 million dollars to put in all these smart meters of water electrical
[01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:22.480]  and gas meters on our homes they did this with two-line sentence in our city agenda which we
[01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:27.040]  thought as being a violation of texas opens meetings law but there's a real good reason
[01:27:27.040 --> 01:27:32.320]  why you have the same you can't beat city hall and that's a long story into itself but because of
[01:27:33.120 --> 01:27:39.200]  right after that i started submitting agenda action item forms to be an action item on the agenda
[01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:45.120]  which was denied to me five times by our mayor who happens to live across the street from me
[01:27:45.120 --> 01:27:50.480]  and we share a parking lot at work so you don't get much closer to your elected officials uh even in
[01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:57.040]  this small little community i was literally blocked five times for even having the ability
[01:27:57.920 --> 01:28:02.480]  to seek action in my elected official which by the way is illegal under the state constitution
[01:28:02.480 --> 01:28:06.880]  and again it shows how there's a wall because they know they're in the wrong and there's always
[01:28:06.880 --> 01:28:12.080]  money paid one way or other and it turns out smart meters break more often cost more money
[01:28:12.080 --> 01:28:18.560]  have to be replaced quicker so it actually also is another boondoggle on top of it well in in one
[01:28:18.560 --> 01:28:24.720]  report after a matter of hours in one will home there was already a dishwasher fire well
[01:28:24.720 --> 01:28:30.560]  whoever heard of a dishwasher fire you know that just doesn't happen okay so then because of all the
[01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:36.000]  high profile and the fact that there's so many issues about the smart meter that let me tell you
[01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:41.120]  personally the reason i'm in this to the magnitude of sacrifice and time and energy is the health
[01:28:41.120 --> 01:28:45.840]  consequences your pineal gland that detects darkness can't tell the difference between
[01:28:45.840 --> 01:28:50.320]  light frequencies and the frequencies from these high that's right so you're never really getting
[01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:55.520]  sleep you're never absolutely studies and rats you can look them up and they actually sleep better
[01:28:55.520 --> 01:29:01.600]  when the uh wireless is off well i had a vietnam bet i have a little wellness shop and so i had
[01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:06.400]  people come in all all the time about sleeping problems and he was sleeping one hour a day i
[01:29:06.400 --> 01:29:11.520]  said joe go get rid of your cordless phone turn off your wi-fi put yourself in that room and
[01:29:11.520 --> 01:29:17.120]  alexi starts sleeping four to five hours a night uh people come in complaining migraine's a headache

[01:34:23.520 --> 01:34:28.560]  talk on the phone when i'm driving i think they even have a law there against it with the hands
[01:34:28.560 --> 01:34:32.880]  free because the nanny state said so he said i'll call you back when i'm not driving anymore but by
[01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:39.040]  then uh i was on air so i'll try to get a hold of them to find out what's going on with that uh and
[01:34:40.080 --> 01:34:45.520]  a lot of other things coming up ladies and gentlemen by the way we're working on a guest uh

[01:34:52.640 --> 01:34:56.400]  segment i'll give you an idea if we're going to be doing that in the last 30 minutes of the next
[01:34:56.400 --> 01:35:01.760]  hour or not but let's i've been talking about smart meters or talking about how this is happening
[01:35:01.760 --> 01:35:06.160]  we're going to go back and let's uh she'll finish her point there's also a website we can put on
[01:35:06.160 --> 01:35:13.200]  screen for tv viewers uh if people want to visit it as kind of a model for their state it's band texas
[01:35:13.200 --> 01:35:23.040]  smart meters and what is the url band texas smart meters dot com uh and again the lady that we have
[01:35:23.040 --> 01:35:29.360]  on the line um i'm glad she told us about this it's in the new york times uh what she and others
[01:35:29.360 --> 01:35:34.480]  have been able to do but she was the one that haunt showed it to start as towns say no signs of rising
[01:35:35.120 --> 01:35:40.800]  resistance to smart meters uh brady texas is where it starts and it talks about what she and others
[01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:45.600]  did again more of our listeners uh taking action but i thought before we went back to her since
[01:35:45.600 --> 01:35:49.360]  we got on this subject and the lord moves in mysterious ways let me show you some of these
[01:35:49.360 --> 01:35:54.400]  articles here for those of you that are uh in denial we showed wired magazine and ap earlier
[01:35:54.400 --> 01:35:59.200]  where the cia says they're watching and listening to you via all the smart stuff in your house without
[01:35:59.200 --> 01:36:06.400]  warrants and by the way you're the target and they know this stuff is frying you frying you
[01:36:06.400 --> 01:36:15.360]  you ready to hear first google's ambient background spy tech and it has the patent in our article that
[01:36:15.360 --> 01:36:23.040]  first reported on it in 2006 people thought we were lying that's prism planet dot com here's the daily
[01:36:23.040 --> 01:36:27.760]  mail if not is nothing off limits now google plans to spy on background noise in your phone calls
[01:36:27.760 --> 01:36:32.960]  that bombard you with tailored adverts and that's already begun but it's not just your phone calls
[01:36:32.960 --> 01:36:37.840]  in your house it's everything and then it breaks down their patent from 2006 and they're already
[01:36:37.840 --> 01:36:43.440]  doing it by the way they are the nsa horizon follows google and turning phones tv into info
[01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:48.400]  wiretaps so you gotta have a new digital tv they got microphones built in they're tracking everything

[01:37:17.280 --> 01:37:21.760]  it'll be 20 000 percent from the numbers i've seen i mean it's just going to get where everybody's
[01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:26.880]  dying but it's like trending well let's jog to get funding for all the sick people and fundraisers

[01:38:26.640 --> 01:38:31.520]  doing all this stuff and the honey bees eat the corn pollen and all die and then the studies come
[01:38:31.520 --> 01:38:38.480]  out in germany and canada and government studies confirming it i mean i read that article like five
[01:38:38.480 --> 01:38:43.920]  times last year on air out of the washington post where it said farmers are breaking gmo planting
[01:38:43.920 --> 01:38:52.560]  rules not creating sanctuaries for the insects when they have these gmo wheat crops potato crops
[01:38:53.440 --> 01:39:01.360]  corn crops all of it they have to plant another field the same size so that all the insects
[01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:06.160]  don't die see the globals don't want all the insects to die so you've got to plant something
[01:39:06.160 --> 01:39:12.160]  for the insects to eat and then the humans are given it i mean it is just and i'm just

[02:00:58.480 --> 02:01:03.920]  ram paul and ted cruiser playing them not the other way around and they already know that i mean
[02:01:03.920 --> 02:01:07.760]  i'm not saying a secret when they were when the republicans were trying to stop him in the primaries
[02:01:07.760 --> 02:01:12.800]  a few years ago when the democrats did after they were like we know he's really like alex jones
[02:01:12.800 --> 02:01:18.000]  is putting on a big act like he wants to work with the system and i that's not how i do it
[02:01:18.560 --> 02:01:23.280]  and and and you know rand's like i support the amnesty bill so that then when they get it and
[02:01:23.280 --> 02:01:29.360]  it's a total payoff and criminal he can have credibility to kill it same thing with ted cruiser
[02:01:29.360 --> 02:01:34.400]  because uh yeah it's just they know what they're doing and and it's it's something to behold uh
[02:01:34.400 --> 02:01:38.560]  let's go to julio in illinois julio you're on the air what do you got today buddy
[02:01:38.560 --> 02:01:46.560]  uh hi alex um yeah i was at the uh march against monsanto on saturday in chicago and it was just
[02:01:46.560 --> 02:01:51.600]  astonishing to see all the all the people that were there there about several hundred people
[02:01:51.600 --> 02:01:57.440]  downtown chicago but from all political ideologies were there and it was quite beautiful to see and
[02:01:57.440 --> 02:02:04.640]  uh you know you mentioned about an hour ago how you want to focus solely on gmo's and this genetic
[02:02:04.640 --> 02:02:09.760]  revolution i want to focus on it more because it's the i mean they're poisoning us on record
[02:02:09.760 --> 02:02:13.840]  and where they admit they're doing it and all the elite won't eat it and the elite won't have
[02:02:13.840 --> 02:02:18.960]  smart crap in their house because it it spies on them and it's hurting them all the big rich
[02:02:18.960 --> 02:02:23.840]  hollywood people i know all the big globalists that come out in the news that i've read about
[02:02:23.840 --> 02:02:29.840]  they go to rural areas to be away from all the electronics and with landlines and nothing but
[02:02:29.840 --> 02:02:36.320]  pure foods for their families they know what they're doing it's game over they're killing us i'm sorry
[02:02:36.320 --> 02:02:42.240]  i'm sorry just every time i i realize it i get upset julio if i caught a neighbor in my house
[02:02:42.240 --> 02:02:50.240]  putting poison soft kill poison in my flower or or or or in grain i would stomp their guts out
[02:02:50.240 --> 02:02:55.360]  and it's not that i'm some tough guy but i mean i am you know a man here and these people are
[02:02:55.360 --> 02:03:00.320]  killing us and i've had enough of the crap i'm sorry go ahead no i hear you alex you know that's
[02:03:00.320 --> 02:03:05.920]  why i i i embarked myself as an independent journalist to cover gmo's and and weather mod in
[02:03:05.920 --> 02:03:11.520]  this genetic modifying society that's going on you know i spoke to a university of california
[02:03:11.520 --> 02:03:17.760]  davis professor kent bradford who was pretty open with me and telling me that about 90 percent
[02:03:17.760 --> 02:03:22.480]  of what you purchase at the grocery store is gmo's and was telling me how wonderful it would
[02:03:22.480 --> 02:03:26.880]  be alex to introduce to your children and and to other children throughout the world
[02:03:26.880 --> 02:03:32.400]  uh fruits and vegetables like apples that will never turn brown never go rotten because of gmo's
[02:03:32.400 --> 02:03:37.600]  and how how wonderful that would be or i spoke to a diplomat from the united nation who told me
[02:03:37.600 --> 02:03:43.200]  how wonderful it would be alex to send third world nations drought resistant seeds so we could
[02:03:43.200 --> 02:03:48.160]  feed third world populations and i saw the documentary it's excellent but but i mean here's
[02:03:48.160 --> 02:03:53.360]  what here's what's crazy there could be genetic engineering that would actually help they are
[02:03:53.360 --> 02:03:58.960]  designing it to hurt you on purpose i've had the top scientist on who quit over this before
[02:04:00.480 --> 02:04:05.040]  spoke to uh professor for my alma mater joel gruber who's a doctor and and that's what he
[02:04:05.040 --> 02:04:10.080]  told me he told me he he he thinks there could be some benefits to genetic engineering but the
[02:04:10.080 --> 02:04:15.360]  weight companies like monsanto cargo and the rest they're doing they're doing this purposely to
[02:04:15.360 --> 02:04:20.800]  destroy crops and one last thing alex you know i i saw the rachel maddow clip of her you know
[02:04:20.800 --> 02:04:26.160]  talking about weather mod it's just it's so funny but here's a few things number one mbc
[02:04:26.160 --> 02:04:32.160]  universal now owned by tomcats owns the weather channel so you know why would you know why would
[02:04:32.160 --> 02:04:36.960]  people want to look up weather modification and then and then secondly alex rachel maddow kind
[02:04:36.960 --> 02:04:42.800]  of did a disservice to what she was trying to do hopefully even if it's just one person watch what
[02:04:42.800 --> 02:04:49.440]  she said and actually looked up weather modification and actually saw government documents she just did
[02:04:49.440 --> 02:04:56.800]  a disservice and in one last thing uh i kind of uh uh what sort of keys this sort of the end of my
[02:04:56.800 --> 02:05:03.360]  film but i have on stay there stay there we'll come back to you prepare by purchasing gold food

[02:08:19.360 --> 02:08:24.400]  we have the filmmaker of the documentary genetically modified society who got in a
[02:08:24.400 --> 02:08:29.520]  julio he's done reporting for us in the past and we are changed up in chicago i've seen it
[02:08:29.520 --> 02:08:33.600]  we should air that on the nightly news uh it's been introduced in the uh hundred thousand
[02:08:33.600 --> 02:08:41.440]  dollar film contest we've got like 500 entries i've watched let's not exaggerate 150 of them or so
[02:08:41.440 --> 02:08:45.680]  on top of going to belgerberg on top of running the news operation trying to make obama deception
[02:08:45.680 --> 02:08:51.760]  to i'm not complaining i just that's why i get busy almost the point of being crazy uh there's
[02:08:51.760 --> 02:08:55.840]  so much like whack-a-mole all these moles are coming up i've got to watch all the other ones
[02:08:56.560 --> 02:09:02.080]  and i've got to judge it first place one hundred thousand dollars uh second place
[02:09:02.960 --> 02:09:08.240]  ten thousand dollars third place five thousand dollars but everybody that enters it gets a chance
[02:09:09.520 --> 02:09:16.720]  to uh work with us on film projects in the future here's my greatest frustration i have a stack of
[02:09:16.720 --> 02:09:22.960]  sponsors that will pay us there are any sponsors on radio and tv for live plugs on the radio
[02:09:23.680 --> 02:09:28.560]  you hear me even skipping the network ads which cost the network money but because i'm the number
[02:09:28.560 --> 02:09:35.200]  one show on genesis that has over 1400 affiliates over 1400 affiliates now on gcn it was like the
[02:09:35.200 --> 02:09:42.160]  third largest maybe the second largest radio network in the u.s they don't put on airs it's a
[02:09:42.160 --> 02:09:48.640]  modest operation but they really are uh almost as successful as talk radio network maybe as
[02:09:48.640 --> 02:09:56.000]  successful and then above that of course clear channel but it's a small company uh yeah basically
[02:09:56.000 --> 02:10:03.520]  that's on the margins of the non monopoly you know big giant radio stations but my big frustration is
[02:10:04.480 --> 02:10:08.320]  i want to be able to hire more reporters more journalists more researchers more people
[02:10:08.320 --> 02:10:14.960]  i don't have time so much to even hire them and then train them and then who assigns the stories
[02:10:14.960 --> 02:10:21.200]  i mean it's just there's so much but i'm trying and i'll tell you if we had the money we have to
[02:10:21.200 --> 02:10:25.280]  have a modest backups we could run three four months of all the money got turned off but other
[02:10:25.280 --> 02:10:29.920]  than that and i could sell a little bit of real estate i have it if things ever got really bad
[02:10:29.920 --> 02:10:36.320]  but we we we are running on a shoestring people hear me say we cost seven million dollars to
[02:10:36.320 --> 02:10:43.680]  run in full wars every year folks small newspapers you know and in say a town like abalone uh i've
[02:10:43.680 --> 02:10:51.360]  seen the numbers might cost 10 million a year to run okay for what we reach for the amount of people
[02:10:51.360 --> 02:10:56.160]  i reach if i work for the globalist i would be paid 20 million dollars a year i've been offered
[02:10:56.160 --> 02:11:00.000]  that kind of money i mean 12 years ago i don't mean to digress here i want to go to your phone
[02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:05.280]  calls i was told you'll have a tv show you'll have a book deal this is all lined up you do what we
[02:11:05.280 --> 02:11:13.200]  say and up front you know here's millions of dollars and it wasn't hard for me to not sell out
[02:11:15.280 --> 02:11:18.560]  because i i i live to talk about this real information
[02:11:21.120 --> 02:11:26.240]  and we've been somewhat successful on our own but i sit here running around spending my time
[02:11:26.800 --> 02:11:31.840]  trying to get money in here to fund things and if i didn't have to spend my time on that we'd be
[02:11:31.840 --> 02:11:35.680]  much more effective and we are very effective you know they have big trade publications
[02:11:35.680 --> 02:11:41.600]  right about how we're the model of new media and i have bloomberg and the new york times and
[02:11:41.600 --> 02:11:50.400]  vanity fair and the london guardian and just everybody calling a gq uh esquire uh how do you
[02:11:50.400 --> 02:11:55.360]  do it what are you doing how do you because they see the real numbers they know we really do reach
[02:11:55.360 --> 02:11:59.440]  15 million people a week one way or another that's a conservative number they know they're dying while
[02:11:59.440 --> 02:12:05.840]  we're growing how do i do it if i read 15 articles where google says they're watching us and and you
[02:12:05.840 --> 02:12:09.840]  know they admit the smart meters are giving us cancer and they admit you know they catch the
[02:12:09.840 --> 02:12:15.040]  u n adding sterilants to vaccines and i've got you know the times of india reporting on it i mean
[02:12:15.040 --> 02:12:23.760]  i'm going to cover that and i guess because i'm flamboyant in that i get upset by this i take it
[02:12:23.760 --> 02:12:29.440]  personal i'm freaked out i'm living in a science fiction dystopia it's getting worse by the minute
[02:12:31.680 --> 02:12:36.160]  i know it's real i've gotten the phone calls my wife's gotten the phone calls saying
[02:12:36.160 --> 02:12:41.760]  you don't stop what you're doing we're going to kill you and you say you know a couple of
[02:12:41.760 --> 02:12:49.120]  pejoratives at them gotta be honest that's what you do they're like really you were just talking to
[02:12:49.120 --> 02:12:55.760]  your uncle your mom or your dad about this you better watch it i'm like no you better watch it
[02:12:55.760 --> 02:12:59.840]  you think you're safe working for people they give you the type of power they're able to do this
[02:13:01.920 --> 02:13:07.120]  that's why i don't have bodyguards and nothing okay i'm in god's hands and if they kill me tomorrow
[02:13:07.120 --> 02:13:12.720]  that's the way it is i am not part of disease and killing all these children i'm not just talking
[02:13:12.720 --> 02:13:17.680]  about abortion and partial birth abortion i mean all the walking dead out there and they're killing
[02:13:17.680 --> 02:13:23.040]  everybody it's getting worse by the month and i will not sign on to it i will not be part of it
[02:13:24.560 --> 02:13:30.160]  bill gates father former head of plant parenthood known eugenicist constant meetings about
[02:13:30.160 --> 02:13:34.800]  their trying to reduce population making jokes about releasing our number down to zero at ted
[02:13:34.800 --> 02:13:41.200]  conferences and all the fellow travelers laugh at it man i take that serious people say well why do
[02:13:41.200 --> 02:13:46.880]  you like mike judge he made a film about eugenics everybody being dumbed down they're dumbing us down
[02:13:46.880 --> 02:13:57.120]  on purpose real eugenics is about dumbing people down to get rid of them it's about a lion eating
[02:13:57.120 --> 02:14:03.040]  the other male baby lion our grizzly bear eating the male grizzly the baby so it doesn't have to
[02:14:03.040 --> 02:14:11.120]  be challenged by him later for territory and mates that's all these globalists are into man
[02:14:11.120 --> 02:14:18.160]  we're under attack we're under a war and there probably are in some areas too many people
[02:14:18.800 --> 02:14:24.480]  but we they won't let us develop the technologies to empower humanity instead some smiley face
[02:14:24.480 --> 02:14:29.600]  punk gets to talk about how he's rolling out mosquitoes it'll forcibly inject you with crap
[02:14:29.600 --> 02:14:33.920]  whether you like it or not last time i said that somebody had sent a comment on the site
[02:14:33.920 --> 02:14:38.640]  going mosquitoes suck they don't inject if you weren't so stupid some of you willfully
[02:14:38.640 --> 02:14:44.080]  you might actually be able to have a life mosquitoes inject high-powered saliva out of
[02:14:44.080 --> 02:14:51.360]  their proboscis into your bloodstream to liquefy the platelets and to asanguate the juices
[02:14:53.120 --> 02:14:58.320]  that's why the patents on record are they're already been caught all over the world loading
[02:14:58.320 --> 02:15:06.720]  mosquitoes with forced vaccines and the vaccines are to reduce fertility the vaccines are to give
[02:15:06.720 --> 02:15:10.720]  you cancer delayed action and the cancers are to reduce iq
[02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:18.960]  look it up okay don't believe me look up patents for for mosquito to deliver vaccines
[02:15:19.760 --> 02:15:23.360]  and they've already caught i'm doing it it's going on right now in florida
[02:15:25.360 --> 02:15:31.440]  and i take it personal that some smiley face billionaire piece of garbage is up there laughing
[02:15:31.440 --> 02:15:38.560]  on ted tv about reducing our numbers down to zero while he thinks it's funny now listen here to all
[02:15:38.560 --> 02:15:43.120]  that you've had served the system you see them saying the veterans of the terrorist because in
[02:15:43.120 --> 02:15:47.200]  the next 10 to 15 years if they have their way we're holding them back they say they're 10 years
[02:15:47.200 --> 02:15:50.560]  behind people like where's the new world order why didn't got a lot worse because we're holding
[02:15:50.560 --> 02:15:54.560]  them back we're holding the door people are like saying are you sure there's something on the other
[02:15:54.560 --> 02:15:59.680]  side are you can hear the scraping on the other side the battering ram you can see the history
[02:15:59.680 --> 02:16:05.520]  and people or it is super mosquitoes could fight malaria with a bite and deliver it oh but it's nice
[02:16:05.520 --> 02:16:09.360]  see oh god
[02:16:12.480 --> 02:16:15.920]  okay i said i'd go to your calls julio you made that film it's great
[02:16:15.920 --> 02:16:18.480]  what was your last point because i got to get to everybody else or i'll get to nobody
[02:16:19.520 --> 02:16:24.000]  i appreciate that alexander it towards the end of the film i teased i really didn't have
[02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:29.120]  enough time to to to expose weather modification the way i wanted to but the director of national
[02:16:29.120 --> 02:16:34.880]  weather service kind of hinted that oh yes there there there has been weather modification but
[02:16:34.880 --> 02:16:38.960]  oh we're not doing that anymore uh... you know that that's just old technology
[02:16:38.960 --> 02:16:43.840]  well a couple weeks later i went to your neck of the woods out in san antonio texas attending
[02:16:43.840 --> 02:16:49.920]  a weather modification conference which doesn't exist i i doesn't exist they told me i had one
[02:16:49.920 --> 02:16:57.120]  person tell me that a government organization permits and approves all of the cloud seeding
[02:16:57.120 --> 02:17:00.640]  all of the solar radiation management none other than there's a congressional weather
[02:17:00.640 --> 02:17:04.560]  modification board uh... under the department of energy now it's well known
[02:17:05.120 --> 02:17:10.080]  okay billy hutchinson introduced that bill i believe back in 2005 but i'm currently working
[02:17:10.080 --> 02:17:14.640]  right now as we speak on a freedom of information act request i don't want to pull a bright
[02:17:14.640 --> 02:17:20.880]  part and say too much but what i what i'm going to uncover it's pretty shocking and it will
[02:17:20.880 --> 02:17:25.760]  make rachel maddow look more like a fool than than she already is what i said was i said
[02:17:25.760 --> 02:17:31.440]  weather modification is real this probably wasn't this is probably a real tornado and then she edited
[02:17:31.440 --> 02:17:36.560]  it to where it sounds like i'm saying obama sent the tornado and she should probably take that
[02:17:36.560 --> 02:17:42.400]  clip out and play it and it's a desperation move god bless you julio break it with us here when
[02:17:42.400 --> 02:17:46.000]  you get it that's a great reporter wish you had the money to hire him and bring him down here i

[02:18:13.440 --> 02:18:21.040]  and an icky engineer um you know i live on the coast uh south uh the south part of kayton and uh
[02:18:21.040 --> 02:18:25.920]  basically i see it it is real uh there are a lot of cameras coming up all over the place all over
[02:18:25.920 --> 02:18:30.800]  the national roads as well in our country nobby seems to be assuming a responsibility for them
[02:18:30.800 --> 02:18:35.440]  or what they're doing uh but it's pretty plain to see that they're basically want to start spying
[02:18:35.440 --> 02:18:41.280]  on everybody as well this side um it's worse in janisburg but a lot all over the national roads
[02:18:41.280 --> 02:18:46.160]  and also the banks in our country as well when uh people's accounts are running into devid more
[02:18:46.160 --> 02:18:51.120]  and more these days it's becoming more frequent because of the pressure of this uh satanic system
[02:18:51.120 --> 02:18:55.120]  that basically we're under and bottom line is that people now banks are charging them more than they
[02:18:55.120 --> 02:19:02.000]  can afford to put back when their accounts are running debit and uh to explain this we can build
[02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:06.880]  unlimited civilizations with the technology we have the globalists admit that they are artificially
[02:19:06.880 --> 02:19:12.240]  imploding the world economy into their hands and out of the social revolution that comes
[02:19:12.240 --> 02:19:17.920]  they're going to use the giant unwashed mass to fully enslave the producers this is a globalist

[02:24:23.200 --> 02:24:27.520]  they flashed up on screen a bloomberg article one they wrote about me a few years ago
[02:24:28.560 --> 02:24:32.160]  that said bloomberg's been calling me a bunch doing some peace and i thought it was already out
[02:24:32.160 --> 02:24:36.000]  because it said may 26 i thought oh it must have already happened that was in 2009 there's another
[02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:43.760]  piece coming out this week but it's conspiracy buffs worn of kissinger cabal red mailbox dots
[02:24:45.280 --> 02:24:50.240]  we're talking about red mailbox dots it's like rachel madhouse like and look at this engine part
[02:24:50.880 --> 02:24:58.720]  from 9 11 jones is discredited and he says 9 11 didn't even happen what oklahoma city didn't
[02:24:58.720 --> 02:25:07.520]  happen no i didn't say that i said the globalists clearly carried out oklahoma city and on 9 11
[02:25:07.520 --> 02:25:11.600]  they were financing and protecting the al-qaeda people that were involved that even came out in
[02:25:11.600 --> 02:25:17.840]  newsweek that they were protected and allowed to be involved in it just like i have mainstream news
[02:25:17.840 --> 02:25:22.640]  articles after i go to your calls i'm going to go over with rand paul going why are we arming al-qaeda
[02:25:22.640 --> 02:25:29.760]  to attack syria that's associated press that's roiders i i thought that was crazy when i said
[02:25:29.760 --> 02:25:34.640]  that see it is crazy that they're funding al-qaeda publicly while telling you give
[02:25:34.640 --> 02:25:41.680]  your rights up but i'm not the one that's crazy okay there are literally thousands of studies
[02:25:42.960 --> 02:25:48.000]  that hydrofluorosalic acid lowers your iq gives you bone cancer pancreatic cancer
[02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:56.960]  uh lukemias don't believe me type in harvard studies everybody salivates off the name harvard
[02:25:58.240 --> 02:26:03.200]  and they look at two dozen studies and say it's conclusive this stuff will kill you and and i know
[02:26:03.200 --> 02:26:08.400]  i keep saying that every hour because i just had the realization that that's the proof of how crazy
[02:26:08.400 --> 02:26:14.560]  this is the old timers in the 40s said don't put that in the water this is toxic waste fluoride and
[02:26:14.560 --> 02:26:19.600]  it's going to really hurt people shut up crazy man what you're going to nuke the russians you know
[02:26:19.600 --> 02:26:28.080]  is doctor strange love there it is government top university studies fluoride lowers iq and
[02:26:28.080 --> 02:26:34.160]  causes other health problems duh and then it looks at how we have the worst health in the world
[02:26:35.360 --> 02:26:40.080]  the worst health and i know you're like alex you said it in the first hour you said it in the
[02:26:40.080 --> 02:26:48.320]  second hour i just marvel that they're killing us and it's fun do you know what industrially is used
[02:26:48.320 --> 02:26:55.280]  to be sprayed on the crops by crop dusters when it's actually dust and not spray still do you know
[02:26:55.280 --> 02:27:00.320]  what i last time i checked it's the second most sold there's different variants of it but if you
[02:27:00.320 --> 02:27:05.680]  add them all together you don't the second most popular dust is when they actually dust crops
[02:27:05.680 --> 02:27:14.640]  do you know what aircraft spray out on crops do you powdered hydrofluorosilic acid
[02:27:15.200 --> 02:27:18.480]  because it's more psychoactive it's like souped up fluoride
[02:27:22.160 --> 02:27:24.000]  by the way they won't believe that type in
[02:27:27.600 --> 02:27:33.280]  EPA sets limits on fluoride as pesticide and they just said last year we recommend
[02:27:33.280 --> 02:27:39.360]  this be phased out that's real deadly oh yeah the stuff there it is EPA proposes
[02:27:39.360 --> 02:27:45.200]  phase out a fluoride-based pesticide boom new york times i guess 2011 now time flies i'm going to

[02:34:15.360 --> 02:34:22.880]  and here's another one out of foreign policy um put out by the washington post my colleagues just
[02:34:22.880 --> 02:34:30.560]  voted to arm the allies of al-qaeda that's a quote by rand paul people are like really
[02:34:31.280 --> 02:34:37.200]  also i pointed this out before but now it's been picked up and a bunch of publications op ed says
[02:34:37.200 --> 02:34:42.400]  right on gibson guitar is another case of obama targeting conservatives and again that they're
[02:34:42.400 --> 02:34:48.720]  targeting anybody who is a nationalist or anybody that's a populist or anybody who's a libertarian
[02:34:48.720 --> 02:34:55.520]  they don't target mainline republicans they target people that are actually patriots because
[02:34:55.520 --> 02:35:02.320]  what republicans say a lot of it's true they just betray and don't do it okay and again they also
[02:35:02.320 --> 02:35:07.600]  been in the past targeted mainline uh you know you know conservatives that started to wake up
[02:35:07.600 --> 02:35:12.080]  but they've also targeted alternative media liberals that are anti-war and stuff and this
[02:35:12.080 --> 02:35:17.200]  is what prosecution is when the government comes after you for political views that's
[02:35:17.200 --> 02:35:24.480]  nazi germany that's how nazi germany started in 33 34 35 36 37 it wasn't till 38 39 they started
[02:35:24.480 --> 02:35:30.800]  arresting everybody and and now they're training with homeland security to go after the american
[02:35:30.800 --> 02:35:35.040]  people that's a big deal and i haven't gotten to this yet maybe i'll cover it on the nightly
[02:35:35.040 --> 02:35:40.320]  news tonight with david night because it's such a big deal but because it's the same global model
[02:35:40.320 --> 02:35:43.680]  scotland every child to have a state guardian from birth they're like well it's just to make
[02:35:43.680 --> 02:35:48.400]  sure the parents aren't bad who watches the government this is designed to break up the
[02:35:48.400 --> 02:35:55.920]  family this is the globalist plan that's the issue is that they when the government has you
[02:35:55.920 --> 02:36:02.480]  in their custody they put right at 68 percent of foster children u.s nationwide number pull it up
[02:36:03.360 --> 02:36:10.320]  right at two-thirds of foster children are on an average of seven psychotropic drugs because
[02:36:10.320 --> 02:36:15.200]  they get more money i've had the foster parents on where they're told oh oh you're the three-year-old
[02:36:15.200 --> 02:36:19.760]  yelled we're going to put them on any psychotics because then it's a special needs child you get
[02:36:19.760 --> 02:36:26.640]  more money and the eugenicist like it because it attacks the general public i mean this is hellish
[02:36:26.640 --> 02:36:33.840]  folks what's going on and then if they if they don't get in trouble for all these scandals we're
[02:36:33.840 --> 02:36:41.280]  just being conditioned to accept it scandal fatigue fast and furious irs gate spy gate all of it
[02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:46.640]  vingazi gate and the republican leadership doesn't want to go after them on this because
[02:36:46.640 --> 02:36:51.440]  they're all connected as well well we need to go after them all of them by the way this is huge

[02:38:53.760 --> 02:39:00.400]  it's uh what it's been like to be a whistleblower inside the world bank uh i've been inside the
[02:39:00.400 --> 02:39:06.480]  world bank for 20 years and i've been working together with other world bank whistleblowers
[02:39:06.480 --> 02:39:12.000]  and we've all been you know when you see the elephant and somebody sees the trunk and somebody
[02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:17.200]  sees the foot well we've got a whole group a whole network of whistleblowers and we've been helping
[02:39:17.200 --> 02:39:22.080]  each other figure out exactly what what's what and who's doing what to who and by the way i
[02:39:22.080 --> 02:39:27.680]  didn't shoot your horn properly so folks know who you are uh you're a Yale trained lawyer
[02:39:27.680 --> 02:39:33.360]  and you also went to the school of economics at the university of amsterdam uh before you
[02:39:33.360 --> 02:39:38.400]  worked at the u.s import export bank i won't go over your whole bio but and and you've written
[02:39:38.400 --> 02:39:43.920]  world bank legal documents a legal policy you name it so so you're one of the biggest whistleblowers
[02:39:43.920 --> 02:39:51.360]  in a long time please go ahead well um what we found out was that um there was a lot of corruption
[02:39:51.360 --> 02:39:58.000]  going on and the thing about corruption is it's kind of like a snowball it just keeps getting
[02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:04.720]  bigger and bigger and uh i reported this corruption to the senate committee on foreign relations
[02:40:04.720 --> 02:40:10.720]  when joe biden was the chair and when hillary clinton and barack obama were in the senate
[02:40:11.520 --> 02:40:14.560]  on that committee so you tried to do this through channels for a long time
[02:40:14.560 --> 02:40:23.200]  that's the way you do it um because that way um either they have a chance to solve the problem
[02:40:23.200 --> 02:40:28.000]  or you're ready to move on up the ladder and i've been you know i started out in the basement of
[02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:35.600]  the world bank um you know uh and when i first saw the problem it was in the philippines where
[02:40:36.560 --> 02:40:42.720]  the president of the philippines was corrupt and there was the second largest bank in the philippines
[02:40:42.720 --> 02:40:48.000]  and the world bank had a project there because there had been the east asia financial crisis
[02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:56.640]  this was at the end of the 1990s and what happened was um the man who owned philippine airline
[02:40:57.600 --> 02:41:02.880]  had borrowed money from this bank and was in default on his loan and what he did was he
[02:41:02.880 --> 02:41:10.560]  bought the employee's share in philippine national bank and then the loan couldn't be dispersed so uh
[02:41:10.560 --> 02:41:15.920]  i said to the man who was in charge of the program in the philippines tell the government they're
[02:41:15.920 --> 02:41:22.400]  not going to get the money and instead they had me reassigned so what happened was the loan um
[02:41:23.040 --> 02:41:28.640]  wasn't dispersed for 200 million and then the people who were um depositors in that bank took
[02:41:28.640 --> 02:41:35.840]  their money out so the government had to bail out the bank for uh 493 million dollars and there
[02:41:35.840 --> 02:41:42.000]  was uh another loan from japan for 200 million so in layman's terms it's all designed to fail
[02:41:42.800 --> 02:41:49.440]  well that's 900 million dollars worth of bad loan it wasn't designed to fail it failed because the
[02:41:49.440 --> 02:41:57.520]  president of the philippines was corrupt and and then when the world bank evaluated how the loan
[02:41:57.520 --> 02:42:02.320]  went they said well there was this problem but we couldn't have predicted it the world bank
[02:42:02.320 --> 02:42:09.040]  did a satisfactory job and i said you've got to be kidding you know there's an evaluation at the end
[02:42:09.040 --> 02:42:17.120]  of the project uh i said that's a cover up to the board and that was um the one of the people i told
[02:42:17.120 --> 02:42:22.560]  that to was i was being interviewed for the job of general counsel and the people that were interviewing
[02:42:22.560 --> 02:42:29.200]  me that was an executive search firm said why is it that the general counsel um it's like a revolving
[02:42:29.200 --> 02:42:33.600]  door they none of them stay for longer than two years i said because there's a cover up going
[02:42:33.600 --> 02:42:39.760]  on inside this organization and the thing about the world bank is it issues bonds on the capital
[02:42:39.760 --> 02:42:47.440]  market and then it takes the money from the bond and it takes and it invests the money and it earns
[02:42:47.440 --> 02:42:52.480]  profits and that's how it finances itself every now and then it goes to congress for money but
[02:42:52.480 --> 02:42:58.560]  most of the time it's earning trading profit sure karen you're the expert on this the reason i bring
[02:42:58.560 --> 02:43:03.520]  up the point of giving the third world president or dictator money depending on which area it is
[02:43:03.520 --> 02:43:09.520]  and then they don't pay it back it's well no they don't pay it back and then that signs the country on
[02:43:09.520 --> 02:43:14.480]  the perpetual debt they did it's kind of like sending a teenager credit cards they can never pay
[02:43:14.480 --> 02:43:19.520]  back because you want to get them into debt uh but i mean i mean you were inside of it that's why
[02:43:19.520 --> 02:43:25.840]  i was saying that it's planned to fail well look sometimes you have a good project sometimes you
[02:43:25.840 --> 02:43:31.600]  have a country where it's not a teapot dictator and then it's not such a bad thing you can um
[02:43:32.160 --> 02:43:36.800]  you know if you're going to put your money in and a good investment and it's going to earn a lot
[02:43:36.800 --> 02:43:42.560]  you can pay that loan back so it's you know you can't paint it all with a bad brush you can't say
[02:43:42.560 --> 02:43:48.960]  anybody that goes to a place like that it knows that it's there to um you know snooker the countries
[02:43:48.960 --> 02:43:54.400]  and they so anybody that um sure my point is just that the imf world bank are more and more known as
[02:43:54.400 --> 02:43:58.320]  being being predatory and you know joseph sticklets has talked about that and he probably knew him he
[02:43:58.320 --> 02:44:02.480]  was the chief economist there at the world bank but okay so so like getting to them i guess what
[02:44:02.480 --> 02:44:07.120]  i'm trying to say is that there are good people in that place sure sure there are good projects and
[02:44:07.120 --> 02:44:12.560]  some of the good people um stood up for what was right and became whistleblowers sure we've been
[02:44:12.560 --> 02:44:19.120]  working together to turn this thing around because underlying it all um it it doesn't have to be a
[02:44:19.120 --> 02:44:26.720]  predatory bank um and it i think that it can get us from here to there they're meaning a straight
[02:44:26.720 --> 02:44:34.880]  forward transparent international financial system where countries can actually um turn them their
[02:44:34.880 --> 02:44:41.280]  situation around oh look i get i mean i get the having transparency and nationalizing things or
[02:44:41.280 --> 02:44:45.520]  whatever uh obviously these institutions probably could be turned into something good i obviously
[02:44:45.520 --> 02:44:50.800]  there's good people inside evidence evidence by you but but for lay folks out there explain
[02:44:50.800 --> 02:44:56.560]  to the precipice you say we're on and why you've gone public okay i can tell you right now we were
[02:44:56.560 --> 02:45:03.920]  on a precipice and i'm pretty i'm pretty sure that we um we're turning the titanic around somebody
[02:45:03.920 --> 02:45:09.600]  told me that's a bad metaphor because the titanic hits the iceberg but i happen to think we've just
[02:45:09.600 --> 02:45:15.360]  narrowly missed the iceberg and i think we are turning it around and the reason i think that is
[02:45:15.360 --> 02:45:22.240]  because i've testified in the uk parliament twice they put my testimony up on their website
[02:45:22.240 --> 02:45:28.800]  i testified in the european parliament and uh the thing about the world bank is it's also a
[02:45:28.800 --> 02:45:36.320]  knowledge bank some people that have really good um technical advice go to the world bank um and then
[02:45:36.320 --> 02:45:45.040]  their advice gets built into the project and one of these really good um pieces of software is uh
[02:45:45.040 --> 02:45:50.720]  something they call the stakeholder analysis which um if you get a country expert who knows
[02:45:51.360 --> 02:45:55.520]  you know exactly what's going on in the country and when i say exactly what's going on in the
[02:45:55.520 --> 02:46:02.000]  country i mean on a given problem they know who's involved in the problem either making it worse
[02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:07.360]  or making it better where they stand how powerful they are and if you take that information and you
[02:46:07.360 --> 02:46:13.600]  put it in a computer game simulation you can get a really good idea of where the coalitions are
[02:46:14.240 --> 02:46:19.440]  for improving sure but the hedge funds are using these war games to bring down countries to
[02:46:19.440 --> 02:46:27.040]  consolidate them i mean undoubtedly there's those hyenas involved this software i can tell you if
[02:46:27.040 --> 02:46:34.160]  you're trying to figure out how to avoid a problem it will give you a really good blueprint and i asked
[02:46:34.160 --> 02:46:43.200]  these people in 2004 to model rule of law and i'll tell you who who designed this model it's a
[02:46:44.080 --> 02:46:50.800]  man by the name of yasik kugler he's a professor at the um claremont university but he's also
[02:46:50.800 --> 02:46:58.400]  um been the president of a number of political science um analysts you know their their group
[02:46:58.400 --> 02:47:06.720]  in any event um i modeled rule of law and it told me in 2004 that if the us didn't play by the rules
[02:47:06.720 --> 02:47:11.520]  we were going to lose the ability to just name the president of the world bank there was going to
[02:47:11.520 --> 02:47:17.040]  have to be um an election process so that's the us losing dominant control of a major system of
[02:47:17.040 --> 02:47:23.120]  the world government that's right and that's what happened in 2010 but i went to the treasury
[02:47:23.120 --> 02:47:29.680]  department in 2006 and i said this model is accurate and we better we better straighten ourselves out
[02:47:30.320 --> 02:47:34.320]  and we didn't straighten ourselves out and then i told you i went to the senate committee on foreign
[02:47:34.320 --> 02:47:40.720]  relations and senator luger was there he wrote three letters to the world bank saying don't fire
[02:47:40.720 --> 02:47:48.480]  this lady and they did anyway um and i didn't mind actually because i had been there for 20 years i
[02:47:48.480 --> 02:47:54.800]  had a pension and i just wanted to get the problem solved so i've been working pretty much full time
[02:47:54.800 --> 02:48:00.880]  on this problem i have gone to anybody um who couldn't run away from me fast enough to tell
[02:48:00.880 --> 02:48:08.560]  him that we were uh involved in a collision course because after um after i saw this problem
[02:48:08.560 --> 02:48:15.920]  um looking at it from the world bank which is like a microcosm i then read a larger study that
[02:48:15.920 --> 02:48:20.720]  was written around the same time and it was talking about the world it wasn't talking about the world
[02:48:20.720 --> 02:48:28.480]  bank and this said that if we didn't start playing by the rules there was going to be a currency war
[02:48:28.480 --> 02:48:34.480]  and china was going to come up way way fast if we started playing by the rules we would be able
[02:48:34.480 --> 02:48:41.200]  to solidify our relationship with the um with our allies and what well that's the same thing i'm
[02:48:41.200 --> 02:48:46.320]  getting from all my pentagon sources is that they and even if they're corrupt they realize
[02:48:46.320 --> 02:48:53.520]  that it's going to wreck the power uh if they continue to print all this money cheat everybody
[02:48:53.520 --> 02:48:58.160]  do all these things and so that's why you're seeing such big shake-ups around the world
[02:48:58.160 --> 02:49:05.440]  but exactly exactly and so for example the people inside the um defense department
[02:49:05.440 --> 02:49:12.160]  that were familiar with the stakeholder analysis the minutes secretary hagel was named i went to
[02:49:12.160 --> 02:49:19.760]  the inspector general in the um department of defense and i said this model is saying that
[02:49:19.760 --> 02:49:25.040]  we have got to clean up our act or we're gonna be you know you can read the model as well as i do
[02:49:25.040 --> 02:49:32.240]  and the next week i got an email from linkedin from the person inside the defense department
[02:49:32.240 --> 02:49:39.200]  who had been working on that model i had spoken directly to um secretary hagel when he was a
[02:49:39.200 --> 02:49:46.880]  senator um from nebraska yeah so they know the corruption 2008 sure sure so we're gonna go to
[02:49:46.880 --> 02:49:51.120]  break this is powerful let's come back with that but i'm familiar with this just from my sources
[02:49:51.120 --> 02:49:56.560]  they realize the snowball of corruption so out of control they can't even control themselves
[02:49:56.560 --> 02:50:02.720]  and it's going to force everyone to leave the dollar not because they hate america but because
[02:50:02.720 --> 02:50:07.600]  it's going to destroy them if they don't is that accurate we've turned it around we're not leaving
[02:50:07.600 --> 02:50:12.160]  the dollar and we'll talk about gold at the other end of your break all right i want to hear what

[02:55:36.320 --> 02:55:40.800]  segment tell me about the persecution you're going through but the good news of the governor's
[02:55:40.800 --> 02:55:48.960]  being aware go ahead okay the persecution is very simple um i have to go to uh criminal court
[02:55:48.960 --> 02:55:54.960]  on the 30th of may eric holders people are there waiting for me the district attorney for the
[02:55:54.960 --> 02:56:02.160]  district of columbia and i'm charged with trespass which is impossible because the 180
[02:56:02.160 --> 02:56:08.480]  ministers of finance that run the world bank wanted me back there so it's trumped up charges
[02:56:08.480 --> 02:56:13.920]  and you know that's that's what they're trying yeah you were telling me the security firm you
[02:56:13.920 --> 02:56:19.680]  know is owned by the globalist so that's how crazy it is is that you go back for a meeting there
[02:56:19.680 --> 02:56:24.560]  and then they and then they charge you with us that's right well actually what i did was i
[02:56:24.560 --> 02:56:31.040]  sent an email to the commissioner of police michael reese and i said if you don't think i'm
[02:56:31.040 --> 02:56:37.440]  really reinstated you just uh here's the email address of the man who's um in charge of the
[02:56:37.440 --> 02:56:43.840]  development committee that's the president of the national bank of poland or you can ask the dean
[02:56:43.840 --> 02:56:53.680]  of the board of executive directors dr uh hassan and he didn't do that so he suckered me there
[02:56:53.680 --> 02:57:00.640]  and then he handcuffed me and kept me outside in his squad car for an hour all right so that's the
[02:57:00.640 --> 02:57:05.280]  first part now let me just skip ahead to something that everybody ought to know and doesn't know
[02:57:05.280 --> 02:57:10.960]  and that is that germany asked for their gold back first they asked you know the federal reserve
[02:57:10.960 --> 02:57:18.560]  has their gold 300 tons of it and germany asked to see it the federal reserve wouldn't let them in
[02:57:19.280 --> 02:57:26.640]  and the treasury department set the sent them a paper audit with four pages worth of um you
[02:57:26.640 --> 02:57:33.840]  know uh gobbledygook saying uh we think it's there and so germany said okay we want our
[02:57:33.840 --> 02:57:39.360]  gold back and the federal reserve said germany take a hike you can have it maybe in seven years
[02:57:39.920 --> 02:57:45.840]  now that's an act of war that's not very good at all and that shows how and now they're grabbing
[02:57:45.840 --> 02:57:52.800]  people's private bank accounts and now they're mf global all of this it shows how precarious
[02:57:52.800 --> 02:57:58.400]  everything is well it's not so precarious because i have been telling the attorney's general mail
[02:57:58.400 --> 02:58:05.120]  for two years and what i did was i bought a world bank bond i'm a lawyer that means the world bank
[02:58:05.120 --> 02:58:12.720]  is not immune and i sued the world bank for securities fraud and i sued the auditors of the
[02:58:12.720 --> 02:58:18.960]  world bank kpmg because they were cooking the books and what happened in court hold on stay there

[03:00:22.320 --> 03:00:26.240]  the Yale law school and economics at the University of Amsterdam she worked for the
[03:00:26.240 --> 03:00:32.800]  US import export or export import bank from 1985 then the legal department of the world bank
[03:00:32.800 --> 03:00:37.760]  from 86 2007 and since then she's been behind the scenes whistleblowing through channels and
[03:00:38.320 --> 03:00:42.320]  she established the non-governmental organization committee of the international law section
[03:00:42.320 --> 03:00:49.680]  the american bar association and the committee on multi-lateralism and accountability the
[03:00:49.680 --> 03:00:53.520]  organization of international organizations the american branch of the international
[03:00:53.520 --> 03:00:57.680]  law association this is like a five-minute segment long segment coming up and I'll
[03:00:57.680 --> 03:01:01.760]  reintroduce you for people that just joined us you were getting into Germany and I remember
[03:01:01.760 --> 03:01:07.360]  two years ago my sources saying other countries want their gold Germany was listed I was Bob
[03:01:07.360 --> 03:01:12.880]  Chapman told me that he's now died about a year ago like I think a year ago this month and in
[03:01:14.080 --> 03:01:20.080]  I guess he died in June early June but it'll be a year wow but he was saying that from his sources
[03:01:20.080 --> 03:01:25.360]  but you were you I mean I guess you knew about this beforehand now that has been in the news
[03:01:25.360 --> 03:01:32.160]  please continue with what's going on in the world what's going on in the world is actually
[03:01:32.160 --> 03:01:39.440]  good news I mean it sounds like we're building up to a huge confrontation but the fact of the
[03:01:39.440 --> 03:01:46.960]  matter is when things get to you know to the left corner people start acting reasonable
[03:01:46.960 --> 03:01:54.720]  who haven't been reasonable before and uh the governors understand where we're headed that
[03:01:54.720 --> 03:02:01.840]  we have a choice that's either rule of law or a currency war and guess what one rule of law it won
[03:02:02.400 --> 03:02:08.480]  and so what I expect we're going to be seeing in short order is uh well the first thing that
[03:02:08.480 --> 03:02:12.960]  we're going to be seeing is that people are going to recognize that the mainstream media
[03:02:12.960 --> 03:02:21.280]  is owned by the same economic group uh that what business do they have telling us what our news is
[03:02:21.920 --> 03:02:27.040]  this story that you're hearing from me for the first time it wasn't because I wasn't trying to
[03:02:27.040 --> 03:02:32.080]  get through to you all it's because there was censorship and so once people recognize that
[03:02:32.080 --> 03:02:38.640]  there's censorship why should all of your media be owned by these financial interests the the
[03:02:38.640 --> 03:02:42.080]  simple answer is that it shouldn't be and it won't be that's going to be corrected
[03:02:42.080 --> 03:02:49.600]  uh I've been telling the credit rating agencies for the longest time about these problems when
[03:02:49.600 --> 03:02:56.640]  there was the election uh who was Mitt Romney's national security planning chief it was Robert
[03:02:56.640 --> 03:03:01.760]  Zellick the former president of the world bank who was denied a second term because of corruption
[03:03:02.880 --> 03:03:09.200]  and so when there was the presidential debate ISCBS took cover that question I said why don't you
[03:03:09.200 --> 03:03:13.600]  ask the candidates what they're doing about international corruption there was no question
[03:03:13.600 --> 03:03:19.200]  for the voters what kind of presidential election is it if there's corruption and the and the media
[03:03:19.200 --> 03:03:26.000]  won't tell the the voters this is this is a real problem and this problem is now that's the biggest
[03:03:26.000 --> 03:03:32.000]  thing I have to tell about my whistleblowing and you're saying the US could lose control of the
[03:03:32.000 --> 03:03:40.320]  world bank excuse me you're saying uh the US could lose control the world bank what I'm saying is
[03:03:40.320 --> 03:03:46.080]  that if the US doesn't start playing by the rules we are going to lose the dollar as an international
[03:03:46.080 --> 03:03:53.600]  currency the world bank is a microcosm in the very uh center of the international financial system
[03:03:53.600 --> 03:04:01.600]  and if we're not telling our people that we have a reputation for scoff law that we don't tell the
[03:04:01.600 --> 03:04:08.000]  bondholders what their financial statements are this can't continue that's a massive loss of

[03:08:08.160 --> 03:08:15.360]  all right folks if you just joined us a major insider whistleblower and the justice department
[03:08:15.360 --> 03:08:23.120]  trying to persecute her over this karen hughes ka hughes dot net here's her forbes profile
[03:08:23.840 --> 03:08:29.040]  who is karen hughes she again is from yale law school and also university of amsterdam
[03:08:29.040 --> 03:08:36.240]  and economics she worked as the us export import bank on us from 1985 and then in the legal
[03:08:36.240 --> 03:08:41.280]  department of the world bank from 86 to 2007 she started blowing the whistle then to congress
[03:08:41.280 --> 03:08:46.480]  quietly but through channels she established the non-governmental organization committee
[03:08:46.480 --> 03:08:50.560]  of international law section of the american bar association and the committee a multi
[03:08:52.400 --> 03:08:56.800]  multi transnationalism and the accountability of international organizations of the american
[03:08:56.800 --> 03:09:04.720]  branch of the international law association and she joins us now to continue breaking this down
[03:09:04.720 --> 03:09:12.160]  so what is the big picture what's happening with gold what will happen if we lose the
[03:09:13.040 --> 03:09:22.560]  world dollar reserve currency status and where where is the corruption the main centers of
[03:09:22.560 --> 03:09:29.360]  corruption right now in the imf and world bank okay i'll answer your last question first because
[03:09:29.360 --> 03:09:34.800]  i'm sure your listeners are saying why should i take this lady's word for it uh it's not my word
[03:09:34.800 --> 03:09:44.720]  for it there's very accurate data on who owns the transnational company 40 000 of them and there's
[03:09:44.720 --> 03:09:52.960]  a group of uh mathematicians in switzerland at an institute um that's the number one university
[03:09:52.960 --> 03:09:59.680]  in europe and what they did was they they did a model of that accurate ownership data and they
[03:09:59.680 --> 03:10:08.640]  found out that there's a group of 147 companies and most of these are financial institutions
[03:10:09.760 --> 03:10:18.720]  and they own 40 percent of the net worth of the stock market all over the world and they own
[03:10:18.720 --> 03:10:26.720]  60 percent of the earnings but it's not like they uh they have a lot of money it's they did it through
[03:10:26.720 --> 03:10:31.280]  interlocking corporate directorates in a very clever way in a secret way and it's only because
[03:10:31.280 --> 03:10:37.280]  those mathematicians were able to model it that they found out that guess what all these separate
[03:10:37.280 --> 03:10:43.920]  companies because of the interlocking directorates they're all actually one conglomerate so you have
[03:10:43.920 --> 03:10:50.800]  a world conglomerate of corruption that goes around and they're the ones that own the federal
[03:10:50.800 --> 03:10:57.120]  reserve they're the ones that own all of the media now in the last 20 years the number of owners
[03:10:57.120 --> 03:11:04.240]  of the major media in the u.s went from 50 down to five guess what those five are actually through
[03:11:04.240 --> 03:11:12.800]  interlocking directorates they're all one company one group so you've got a central what this study
[03:11:12.800 --> 03:11:18.400]  calls it is a super entity you have a super entity that thinks it can control the world
[03:11:19.600 --> 03:11:25.600]  guess what we people are a little smarter than that those mathematicians modeled it caught those
[03:11:25.600 --> 03:11:33.360]  people with their hands in the cookie jar and we've been and when I say we it's a group of
[03:11:33.360 --> 03:11:39.360]  world bank whistleblowers and we've gone around and we have you know we've reported the fact that
[03:11:39.360 --> 03:11:46.320]  the world bank financial statements are incorrect and the auditing firm that was supposed to say
[03:11:46.320 --> 03:11:52.320]  whether or not they were reliable financial statements that was KPMG that's one of the main
[03:11:52.320 --> 03:12:01.120]  five auditing firms didn't follow the audit rule so these stocks are traded not just in the federal
[03:12:02.000 --> 03:12:08.560]  system but don't forget you have the state attorneys general are responsible for protecting
[03:12:08.560 --> 03:12:16.320]  their state investors so the states are now working to solve the problem and so we're not
[03:12:16.320 --> 03:12:22.960]  going to have a situation where there's you know chaos and and and whatnot we just we just have
[03:12:22.960 --> 03:12:31.040]  the um our states are going to clean up the mess in the federal government okay so and and when
[03:12:31.040 --> 03:12:35.360]  he was a senator you say you advised Hegel of this and many others and we're seeing some evidence
[03:12:35.360 --> 03:12:40.320]  they're trying to write this because not out of altruism but because it will wreck their own system
[03:12:40.320 --> 03:12:45.520]  they're already in control of the you know the globalist brag that they have this combine this
[03:12:45.520 --> 03:12:49.920]  group of insiders that are given the free credit that are given the insider knowledge that are able
[03:12:49.920 --> 03:12:54.880]  to manipulate things that are given the loans at zero percent interest or in some cases even lower
[03:12:54.880 --> 03:13:02.160]  and they're establishing this global corporatocracy but you're saying that that that you see that that
[03:13:02.160 --> 03:13:07.200]  the establishment is starting to reverse itself but but if this group already has leverage control
[03:13:07.200 --> 03:13:11.680]  of everything how is that the case because i'm not trying to be pessimistic i hope you're right
[03:13:11.680 --> 03:13:18.720]  all i see is militarization of police training to take on the people worldwide and a conversion
[03:13:18.720 --> 03:13:23.520]  to a collapsed economy with these people the only ones that have any other resources and i see a
[03:13:23.520 --> 03:13:28.560]  premeditated program to implode the world to the only ones left with resources to then buy
[03:13:28.560 --> 03:13:35.360]  everything up for pennies on the dollar uh with with kind of a eugenics overlay of social Darwinism
[03:13:35.360 --> 03:13:42.240]  as the as the political rationale that they're doing god's work uh so so what are the signs you say
[03:13:42.240 --> 03:13:47.200]  that this has been turned around and then break down this term that i had never heard of to show my
[03:13:47.200 --> 03:13:57.040]  ignorance uh here of this uh backwardization okay um i can tell you what signs you can see
[03:13:57.040 --> 03:14:03.120]  the fact that i'm on your program the fact that your listeners are hearing about it and are they
[03:14:03.120 --> 03:14:09.360]  going to be sitting on their hands no i hope not they're going to be in touch with their governors
[03:14:09.360 --> 03:14:13.920]  and they're going to say you get this thing straightened out and i can tell you that i have
[03:14:13.920 --> 03:14:21.920]  had a lot of help and it's just been incredible um and so i'm not i'm not the only one that's
[03:14:21.920 --> 03:14:31.440]  telling these um corporate uh kleptomaniacs that um no they didn't you know they may have had plans
[03:14:31.440 --> 03:14:36.240]  for it but it was nipped in the bud they were caught with their hand in the cookie jar and it's not
[03:14:36.240 --> 03:14:44.560]  happening and it's not happening in the biggest way uh and i mean it's not like the listeners can
[03:14:44.560 --> 03:14:49.520]  just sort of sit back and say okay the problem's solved no you're part of the solution you you
[03:14:49.520 --> 03:14:55.520]  know you stay tuned you figure out what's going on you you get active you work together with well
[03:14:55.520 --> 03:15:01.120]  what are the signs what are the signs you're seeing that there are insane parts of the establishment
[03:15:01.680 --> 03:15:08.240]  uh trying to reverse this and trying to secure the dollar's world reserve currency status okay um
[03:15:08.240 --> 03:15:14.480]  you'll see it for example in uh one of these bills that the mega banks are going to have to pay more
[03:15:14.480 --> 03:15:19.600]  money they're going to have to have stronger reserves because they're too big to fail so they've
[03:15:19.600 --> 03:15:26.080]  got to have um a bigger capital requirement that's um a proposal from i'm trying to remember the
[03:15:26.080 --> 03:15:29.440]  show you think the wall street journals ride the Bernanke's out in august and they're going to raise
[03:15:29.440 --> 03:15:36.000]  interest rates i don't know about when Bernanke's out but i can tell you that i've been writing to
[03:15:36.000 --> 03:15:40.880]  the federal reserve because Bernanke is on something called the national advisory council
[03:15:40.880 --> 03:15:47.760]  on international monetary and financial policies yes that's a big um long name but basically what
[03:15:47.760 --> 03:15:53.440]  that is is that uh the secretary of the treasury heads that that's coordination with other governments
[03:15:54.400 --> 03:15:58.960]  there is a lot of coordination with other governments i i was up all night last night
[03:15:58.960 --> 03:16:06.560]  sending taxes to all of the 188 ministers of finance that run the world bank to give them an update
[03:16:06.560 --> 03:16:12.800]  uh on this they're you know they've they've been aware of this problem they've seen it coming and
[03:16:12.800 --> 03:16:19.280]  they wanted me to try to rally the troops and so you're saying after after six years of whistleblowing
[03:16:19.840 --> 03:16:24.480]  you're starting to see signs that show the establishment gets it which i would think is
[03:16:24.480 --> 03:16:30.640]  sane i don't get destroying the world's system to get power when these people are already in power
[03:16:30.640 --> 03:16:37.440]  i mean it's just pure nastiness pure craziness a bunch of hedge fund hyena guys leveraging trillions
[03:16:37.440 --> 03:16:43.280]  worth tens of billions of peace like jamie diamond and all of them trying to show off to one another
[03:16:43.280 --> 03:16:49.120]  you know that they've got 50 jet copters and you've only got 30 meanwhile there's no civilization i
[03:16:49.120 --> 03:16:54.400]  mean or is that what you're saying is that you're seeing signs that sanity is entering the building
[03:16:54.400 --> 03:17:02.080]  yes absolutely i mean these guys instead of wearing their status as the ceo in this network
[03:17:02.080 --> 03:17:10.000]  of control as a sign of um great uh esteem these guys are going to be seen for what they really are
[03:17:10.000 --> 03:17:17.200]  crooks no i think we're i think we're in good shape actually um i'm i'm i'm just going to start
[03:17:17.200 --> 03:17:23.280]  really enjoying to see how these people are brought down to earth with the rest of us they're not
[03:17:23.280 --> 03:17:28.240]  above the law the law is there and you know one of the one of the points i wanted to make is that
[03:17:29.040 --> 03:17:35.280]  it's not like we're talking about world government we're talking about just the opposite the one thing
[03:17:35.280 --> 03:17:42.720]  that we're going to have is we're going to have world um rationality we're going to have law applying
[03:17:42.720 --> 03:17:49.440]  to these crooks that thought they were going to get away with it well ma'am i'm no i'm no economist
[03:17:49.440 --> 03:17:53.680]  in in harvard lawyer like you but i do try to study this and i talked to a lot of the world's
[03:17:53.680 --> 03:17:58.960]  experts and i really find what you say to be pretty accurate from some of the things i'm saying
[03:17:58.960 --> 03:18:03.760]  what i think is going on here is there's a battle over the future and are we going to let these
[03:18:04.880 --> 03:18:11.680]  crazy arrogant private central bankers and hedge fund people really melt down our whole future just
[03:18:11.680 --> 03:18:17.920]  so they can you know run everything when they already run everything uh but but what's going on
[03:18:17.920 --> 03:18:25.280]  with gold then or i mean are are we going to see prosecution of these people or will we just see them
[03:18:25.280 --> 03:18:31.600]  basically you know sent to abstention or or or you know like napoleon or something well the first
[03:18:31.600 --> 03:18:37.520]  thing we're going to see is um and the reason why we're all coming together on this now is because
[03:18:37.520 --> 03:18:44.640]  we were going to run out of time the the thing about gold backwardization is that um people
[03:18:44.640 --> 03:18:52.560]  who have gold will not sell it for paper money because the paper money doesn't seem to be trust
[03:18:52.560 --> 03:18:59.200]  worthy and the first reason why the dollar wouldn't be seen to be trustworthy is because we've got
[03:18:59.200 --> 03:19:08.800]  these fake accountant audits that aren't following the accounting rules uh there are a number of
[03:19:08.800 --> 03:19:16.000]  whistleblowers inside the world bank who saw that the uh the numbers weren't adding up and when they
[03:19:16.000 --> 03:19:22.720]  reported it they would get thrown out with no recourse so if that happens inside a banking
[03:19:22.720 --> 03:19:29.920]  institution you can't rely on the financial information and so that means that all the
[03:19:29.920 --> 03:19:35.280]  regulators in the world have got a crackdown and so what you're going to have is you're not going to
[03:19:35.280 --> 03:19:42.320]  have one central place that's going to run the world but you're going to have all of the different
[03:19:42.320 --> 03:19:51.360]  local places the state applying the same rule but being um able to do that all together because
[03:19:51.360 --> 03:19:57.360]  of the flow of information and so what what i've had now and the other world whistleblowers have
[03:19:57.360 --> 03:20:06.000]  had is we've seen for example the uk parliament is now helping the the the governor crack down on
[03:20:06.000 --> 03:20:12.880]  these illegal um financial sure and and i mean iceland's thrown them out as well but then i see
[03:20:12.880 --> 03:20:18.480]  the acceleration of looting of bank accounts and cypress in places someone argued that was actually
[03:20:18.480 --> 03:20:23.200]  robbing the the bureaucrats money that had already been robbed as well some people even
[03:20:23.200 --> 03:20:30.000]  claimed that was like a reverse robbery but um let me ask you this question then i don't see these
[03:20:30.000 --> 03:20:34.720]  globalist turning loose of power i think they're too dangerous to not be locked up i understand
[03:20:34.720 --> 03:20:38.560]  there's also a danger in running them to ground because in their cornered but i mean i don't see
[03:20:38.560 --> 03:20:44.160]  these people ever giving up it's kind of like you know the uh core sign making 30 to 1 40 to 1
[03:20:44.160 --> 03:20:51.200]  bets with other people's money that were dangerous bets to begin with so their arrogance is they're
[03:20:51.200 --> 03:20:55.840]  undoing but also makes them that much more dangerous and i understand there's a lot of people you
[03:20:55.840 --> 03:21:01.040]  talk to they're listening to you in the system but i don't i don't see these globalist these
[03:21:01.040 --> 03:21:07.920]  new world order people i don't see them giving up i i i mean i i just i just don't see the proof
[03:21:07.920 --> 03:21:13.520]  of sanity i mean are you saying maybe all these scandals coming out and congress growing somewhat
[03:21:13.520 --> 03:21:19.120]  of a spinal cord uh and actually are doing some real investigations now is that a sign of what's
[03:21:19.120 --> 03:21:24.960]  happening i'll tell you what i think is going to be the mechanism for the transformation
[03:21:24.960 --> 03:21:32.320]  it's going to be the transparency and the flow of information and so you're going to see scandals
[03:21:32.320 --> 03:21:37.840]  you're going to see these people shamed it's not so much i mean i i can't speak to you're saying
[03:21:37.840 --> 03:21:44.160]  a flood i'm saying this a flood of whistleblowers who think they can't get us all if we all start
[03:21:44.160 --> 03:21:49.200]  flooding info so instead of meeting in the parking garage because everything's spot on
[03:21:49.200 --> 03:21:54.240]  everybody start whistleblowing that would bring them down that's exactly what's happening that's
[03:21:54.240 --> 03:22:00.400]  exactly the mechanism and in terms of how this is going to work with um the fiat currency which is
[03:22:00.400 --> 03:22:08.080]  the paper money versus money which is backed by precious metals or um i've also you know recently
[03:22:08.080 --> 03:22:13.280]  been talking to a number of people who think that uh there's also going to be commodities that are
[03:22:13.280 --> 03:22:23.280]  worth um you know markets uh like oil or uh coal or other other um commodities will also back
[03:22:23.280 --> 03:22:29.040]  currency so that um it's not just going to be precious metals because the thing is if you just
[03:22:29.040 --> 03:22:34.000]  stick to the precious metals the people who now have the precious metals are going to be um
[03:22:34.640 --> 03:22:38.640]  they're going to have a leg up it's not fair so there's going to be in other words there's going
[03:22:38.640 --> 03:22:47.600]  to be um a transition where the strong money is going to start to replace the paper currency but
[03:22:47.600 --> 03:22:53.600]  it's not going to be like um the paper currency goes out of uh circulation from one minute to the
[03:22:53.600 --> 03:22:59.200]  next it's not going to be abrupt and just the same way we're not going to have automatically good
[03:22:59.200 --> 03:23:05.680]  rule of law we're not going to automatically have people paying more attention to ethics than um you
[03:23:05.680 --> 03:23:12.160]  know uh survival of the fittest in the marketplace we're going to we're going to all pull ourselves
[03:23:12.160 --> 03:23:16.080]  up by our bootstraps well i agree with you everything's in a process either we shift back
[03:23:16.080 --> 03:23:22.720]  towards rule of law transparency uh stability freedom or we keep going down this path but
[03:23:22.720 --> 03:23:26.800]  they're going to have to bring in total tyranny under their plan because everyone not just
[03:23:26.800 --> 03:23:32.800]  mathematicians is going to know the the bureaucrats are exempt the bankers are exempt the head of ge's
[03:23:32.800 --> 03:23:38.320]  exempt google's exempt from taxes we're seeing whistleblowers out of google a high level as you
[03:23:38.320 --> 03:23:43.520]  pointed out you going public so i am seeing as people realize we're all screwed if we don't
[03:23:43.520 --> 03:23:49.040]  beat these people it's us or them but if we don't beat them they're going to go all the way because
[03:23:49.040 --> 03:23:52.960]  they're going to have to have a total tyranny in a system where everybody knows they're above the
[03:23:52.960 --> 03:23:58.720]  law and that they stole their wealth i mean the justice will be served they are not going to get
[03:23:58.720 --> 03:24:04.560]  away with it they are blowing up society so they can be in charge of it none of us should put up with
[03:24:04.560 --> 03:24:11.440]  that and we're not it's not happening and i think they already know that i mean this this
[03:24:11.440 --> 03:24:18.320]  stakeholder analysis that i was talking about i mean it's really um it's pretty clear that either
[03:24:18.320 --> 03:24:24.400]  there's going to be um rule of law or there's going to be a system where we have to go back
[03:24:24.400 --> 03:24:28.720]  to the middle ages because there won't be any way to finance trade wow you really know what you're
[03:24:28.720 --> 03:24:33.040]  talking about and that's what they want the builder bird group for 50 years says they're
[03:24:33.040 --> 03:24:37.200]  going to do this and then we're going to go back to feudalism and they're going to be like in um
[03:24:37.760 --> 03:24:43.920]  elicium bases but on the ground and on ships that's crazy that's not happening
[03:24:46.800 --> 03:24:51.600]  it's not happening wow i'm really impressed with you uh and i and i just it's so good to know
[03:24:51.600 --> 03:24:55.760]  there's all these whistleblowers and thank god that john b wells got chung's that's a big show with
[03:24:55.760 --> 03:25:00.000]  about six million listeners a night and i hope our listeners get your info out we've only got a
[03:25:00.000 --> 03:25:05.040]  minute or two left i want to get you back on i know you're facing all this whistleblower persecution
[03:25:05.040 --> 03:25:10.480]  but uh you've got a lot of great info on your website for people to visit anything else you'd
[03:25:10.480 --> 03:25:17.760]  like to impart to the listeners no just um hang in there be part of the process to get ourselves
[03:25:17.760 --> 03:25:23.520]  um back in shape and again i just want to emphasize that we've got a federal government and our
[03:25:23.520 --> 03:25:29.920]  states are alive and well thank you well i mean the federal government wasn't training to fight
[03:25:29.920 --> 03:25:34.480]  veterans all day i would think that's true but you're saying you know federal government people
[03:25:34.480 --> 03:25:39.360]  you know what i don't mean the federal government is good i mean we have a federal system and the
[03:25:39.360 --> 03:25:45.920]  states are good and well listen i agree with that but but expanding on that um i think the systems
[03:25:45.920 --> 03:25:51.520]  overshot when they go and say prepare to wage war with the american people and the biggest enemy are
[03:25:51.520 --> 03:25:55.760]  are people that want to you know abolish the fellow reserve i think it's really woken the
[03:25:55.760 --> 03:26:01.520]  the military and police up that they actually are training them for war with us i think they've
[03:26:01.520 --> 03:26:08.800]  gone too far i don't think there's going to be anything close to a war with us because as i said
[03:26:08.800 --> 03:26:14.880]  once more we have our local government we have our state government those governments are ours
[03:26:14.880 --> 03:26:22.400]  and they're not going anywhere we're fine burn good shape i hope you're right i hope you're right
[03:26:22.400 --> 03:26:27.440]  but i mean certainly you see you're being at the oral bank of the in the imf also had the plan
[03:26:27.440 --> 03:26:32.640]  when they imploded economies so they went south you know the imf riot model they are gearing up
[03:26:32.640 --> 03:26:37.520]  the oligarchs think the kleptocratic oligarchs the kleptagarks i just invented a new word
[03:26:37.520 --> 03:26:43.760]  the kleptagarks uh think they're really going to make it or or more and more i do see them running
[03:26:43.760 --> 03:26:49.440]  scared in their actions are you saying they figured out they're going to lose they lost already the
[03:26:49.440 --> 03:26:56.080]  only question is if they try to make it a painful transition they're going to be in worse shape than
[03:26:56.080 --> 03:27:03.600]  they're in already they they hold their own future in their own hand and they can be reasonable and
[03:27:03.600 --> 03:27:09.920]  just go with the flow and and be subject to the law like the rest of us and enjoy it it's really
[03:27:09.920 --> 03:27:16.880]  going to be a better world i hope you're right but i tell you we're sitting on a time bomb this
[03:27:16.880 --> 03:27:20.480]  isn't turned around quick you think that turned around is what i'm trying to tell you
[03:27:23.840 --> 03:27:28.480]  well i hope you're right i think i'm right when did it start turning around
[03:27:30.720 --> 03:27:37.840]  that's a good question um i'm just now starting to get caught up with some i mean i'll just name
[03:27:37.840 --> 03:27:44.240]  a couple of names all right um there's this really uh neat national security whistleblower named
[03:27:44.240 --> 03:27:52.240]  mark navitsky uh and he he educated me on a lot of the um uh you know the internal spying what was
[03:27:52.240 --> 03:28:01.920]  going on and i mean when you've got that kind of um person who's helping and informing everybody
[03:28:01.920 --> 03:28:09.520]  else it's like we just reinforce each other and so i just have every every bit of confidence that um
[03:28:09.520 --> 03:28:14.960]  you know we know where the system is gained and it's not like one of us knows it we all know it
[03:28:14.960 --> 03:28:19.360]  because we've all shared this so the cats out of the bag people are now aware of the program
[03:28:19.360 --> 03:28:24.080]  and then once people realize that there can be evil going on then they start to recognize all of it
[03:28:24.080 --> 03:28:29.120]  and i do see the sleeping giant awakening right now i do exactly point that's exactly the point
[03:28:29.120 --> 03:28:33.360]  and then once we're not naive anymore we can recognize it and then that begins the healing
[03:28:33.360 --> 03:28:39.040]  process or the bankers set off anook in chicago and bring in martial law but you know i think now
[03:28:39.040 --> 03:28:44.240]  that people know the type of stuff they can pull that doesn't have the same power anymore our only
[03:28:44.240 --> 03:28:47.840]  big problem is they've got all the churches working for the government saying it's the end of the world
[03:28:47.840 --> 03:28:53.360]  so all the christians stand down so it's a serious fight i want to say bye to you during this break
