[00:00.000 --> 00:04.760]  Gavin McInnis is back with his all-new online network, FreeSpeech.tv.
[00:04.760 --> 00:34.600]  Gavin McInnis, Joe Biggs, Miley Unopolis, and Soph, all at FreeSpeech.tv.
[01:05.480 --> 01:12.040]  It is Monday, October 21st, 2019. I'm your host, Alex Jones. We're going to be here live for the
[01:12.040 --> 01:17.320]  next four hours ahead of Owen Schreuer and the war room coming to you from deep in the heart of
[01:17.320 --> 01:25.320]  Texas, Austin, broadcasting worldwide. Okay. The globalists have announced to telegraphed
[01:25.320 --> 01:30.120]  their latest impeachment plans to remove the president and what they're going to do
[01:30.120 --> 01:35.080]  after they remove the president. They know it's going to cause civil unrest. I'm not saying
[01:35.080 --> 01:42.200]  they're going to be successful, but they are definitely going to make the hot attempt this year.
[01:42.200 --> 01:47.320]  They've said they are, and they're making all the preparations. And they've also said they'll kill
[01:47.320 --> 01:53.080]  the president, which is very reasonable to go to Trump events and to go to Democrat events
[01:53.080 --> 01:57.000]  and let the establishment know you're not going to kill our president and to let the people that
[01:57.000 --> 02:03.480]  have been calling for it know that their promotion of it is going to hold them responsible. Now,
[02:03.480 --> 02:12.440]  the White House put out Friday, a two minute short video that shows Trump walking out from
[02:12.440 --> 02:20.520]  behind the stage out into the Dallas arena for the biggest crowd yet, and they turned away
[02:20.520 --> 02:38.280]  30,000 people. Go ahead and roll it. And this is why the globalists want to remove Trump because
[02:38.280 --> 02:46.760]  he's boosting our morale. He's teaching us not to hate ourselves. And he is identifying the
[02:46.760 --> 02:52.680]  true enemies of America, communist, socialist, and globalist, which are all the same thing
[02:52.680 --> 02:57.480]  run by the major corporations who want to destabilize humanity and make normal human
[02:57.480 --> 03:04.520]  independence impossible. They want to make everything artificial. Like terminator seeds
[03:04.520 --> 03:11.320]  that Monsanto came out with 30 years ago, they now have in more than 30, 40 major seed varieties.
[03:11.320 --> 03:18.680]  Last time I checked, it's more than 40. Where the plant grows, but then it doesn't produce seeds
[03:18.680 --> 03:25.000]  that will produce a new plant. It's an artificial plant that doesn't continue the life cycle.
[03:25.960 --> 03:32.120]  You have to go back to them to get it each time. It's meant to sell up the markets. It's meant to
[03:32.760 --> 03:38.920]  end any type of self sufficiency. And when you look at these articles, England is the model
[03:38.920 --> 03:46.120]  for this. There are only a few years ahead of us. Actual PC police, British law enforcement,
[03:46.120 --> 03:51.640]  allow convicted male rapists to identify as a female so they can go in bathrooms with women.
[03:51.640 --> 03:59.160]  That's up on infowars.com from RT. Biological male sets world record for women's cycling.
[03:59.800 --> 04:06.200]  It's a war on reality and a war on people's privacy. Teen Vogue, we need to think beyond
[04:06.200 --> 04:13.080]  the incorrect idea that periods are just for women. Once tampons provided in men's bathrooms,
[04:13.640 --> 04:17.800]  you go, that's mental illness. Well, that's like Castro in the debate saying we need money for
[04:18.760 --> 04:25.080]  men that want to have abortions. UK police force highlights problem of racist toddlers.
[04:26.120 --> 04:32.040]  To the globalists want to target children. Body parts buyers were again scalping the babies and
[04:32.040 --> 04:37.960]  selling the scalps to leftist who like to wear them as symbols of their power. UK police investigate
[04:37.960 --> 04:45.000]  transgender being turned down for porn role as a hate crime. That is just some of the news.
[04:45.000 --> 04:50.360]  Meanwhile, you've got the establishment who are a bunch of pedophiles. Start your day with Maximum
[04:50.360 --> 04:56.600]  Gay Kellogg's launches LGBT cereal. And again, all people that are homosexuals don't hate babies
[04:56.600 --> 05:00.520]  and children. But in the left in the establishment in Hollywood, they look down on them. They hate
[05:00.520 --> 05:05.960]  them. And they're just transmuting their religion on to us and then taking over children's spaces.
[05:07.320 --> 05:14.520]  Globalism was doomed to fail if we just exposed it and then resisted it. Didn't I say a thousand
[05:14.520 --> 05:18.280]  times that there's no way you're going to have an authoritarian corporate world government
[05:18.280 --> 05:22.600]  above the law that doesn't pay taxes, that has diplomatic immunity, that runs around saying
[05:22.600 --> 05:27.560]  it's communist and socialist power to the people. But then meanwhile, his tax exempt again off
[05:27.560 --> 05:32.920]  shore. Well, Trump got that and all these other populace get it. Why would you throw away wealthy
[05:32.920 --> 05:38.200]  successful countries and cultures just so you could say the communist Chinese that David Rockefeller
[05:38.200 --> 05:45.160]  put in power are better than everybody? That is a sick freakish joke. And I will not stand by and
[05:45.160 --> 05:50.680]  watch humanity turn over to these people and I beg God for the strength and the will to have the
[05:50.680 --> 05:55.880]  discernment to help me part of their defeat. And I've been saying that prayer for 20 plus years
[05:55.880 --> 06:02.200]  and God is delivering because God is great. Thank God for his son, Jesus Christ. And now let's move
[06:02.200 --> 06:31.080]  forward against the NW. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this October 21st,
[06:31.080 --> 06:37.720]  2019 Global Broadcast. I am your host, Alex Jones. Let me tell you what is coming up today.
[06:39.240 --> 06:43.080]  We have the huge CNN whistleblower,
[06:45.160 --> 06:52.440]  Kerry Porch joining us at the bottom of the next hour and other surprise guests. I'm just going
[06:52.440 --> 06:58.120]  to leave it at that. So you'll definitely want to join us because Project Veritas got a lot of
[06:58.120 --> 07:02.680]  attention last week with that initial group of videos they released, but they have hundreds
[07:02.680 --> 07:09.800]  and hundreds of hours of it. They've released even more important, more and more just insane stuff
[07:09.800 --> 07:15.640]  of what's really going on inside CNN. We're going to be breaking that down with him coming up at
[07:15.640 --> 07:20.840]  the bottom of the next hour. We're looking to have him in studio hopefully on Wednesday.
[07:20.840 --> 07:30.680]  All Joseph Watson is also going to be co-hosting tomorrow and Paul B in studio very, very soon
[07:30.680 --> 07:37.400]  will announce that date a little bit later. You've got a lot of top Democrats coming out
[07:37.960 --> 07:42.680]  and saying that Hillary is planning to run for office that she's already running,
[07:42.680 --> 07:48.760]  that she already runs the DNC, that she's controlling the DNC phone calls, conference calls
[07:48.760 --> 07:53.400]  that are being made. Dick Morris has come out and said, if you have a pulse, you know Hillary
[07:53.400 --> 07:59.320]  Clinton is running. There's now no doubt that she's running, but if you understand
[08:00.520 --> 08:07.320]  her plan of how she's going to run, you understand that there is a coup attempt taking place
[08:08.040 --> 08:14.440]  against the president. And to talk about that coup attempt, we're going to have Mike Adams,
[08:14.440 --> 08:19.480]  who's been doing research on it at a level even above what I've been doing. I mean, I'm doing the
[08:19.480 --> 08:24.360]  most research out there of any major syndicated talk show host, but Mike Adams has gone ultra,
[08:25.640 --> 08:32.920]  ultra deep in all of this and found documents and reports and online major Antifa planning
[08:33.800 --> 08:39.560]  by the mainline groups funded by the Carnegie Ford Rockefeller and Soros Foundations
[08:39.560 --> 08:46.680]  and how they're planning the stage violence to blame it on conservatives, on nationalists,
[08:46.680 --> 08:51.640]  on Trump supporters. Now, I said back when the tragic shootings happened a few months ago in
[08:51.640 --> 08:57.880]  Ohio and in Texas, that both men were Antifa and that they covered up their accounts. And that was
[08:57.880 --> 09:05.320]  the fact. Now, they didn't successfully do it in Ohio. They did it in Texas. We know real people
[09:05.320 --> 09:12.840]  got killed, but the individuals were leftist Antifa who I believe did it to try to trigger a
[09:12.840 --> 09:20.680]  civil war just like Charlie Manson did. It's the same leftist demonic overthrow of society impulse,
[09:21.800 --> 09:25.960]  the same spirit. And but it's confirmed they tried to cover up their social media that they
[09:25.960 --> 09:30.840]  were leftist that hated Trump and thought the world was overpopulated and love Satan and war black
[09:30.840 --> 09:39.160]  and were incels basically. One of them ran a satanic devil band that was into pedophilia and
[09:39.160 --> 09:44.680]  just into anything bad. They're into anything bad. They worship death. They worship hurting God.
[09:44.680 --> 09:51.000]  They worship hurting innocents. They're they're Satanist. And so that's who they are. And they're
[09:51.000 --> 09:55.480]  spoiled brats that boss their parents around. It's always the same MO. They need to have their
[09:55.480 --> 10:00.120]  asses beat when they're about age 10 when they start, you know, acting like that. But instead,
[10:00.120 --> 10:05.400]  they turn into these little little monsters when everybody refuses them and says no to them.
[10:05.400 --> 10:11.320]  They go crazy and do this. We know who commits 98% of school shootings. Literally. That's the
[10:11.320 --> 10:17.640]  numbers from Professor Lott. He's broken them down top global statistician. Now the FBI counts
[10:17.640 --> 10:22.360]  if gang members shoot a few other gang members or the Mexican mafia and Laredo shoots each other.
[10:23.560 --> 10:28.040]  That that's added into mass shootings, but of real shootings at churches and schools
[10:28.040 --> 10:35.000]  and places. It's it's all in cells on drugs into the occult. They had a shooter a couple years ago
[10:35.000 --> 10:40.520]  down by Galveston in between Houston and Galveston. Remember, and he wore Nazi stuff, communist stuff,
[10:40.520 --> 10:46.520]  devil worship upside down crosses, total black and girls didn't like him. So we wanted to show them
[10:46.520 --> 10:52.040]  the power of Satan. It's the same story over and over again. Harris and Clybald, they kicked it all
[10:52.040 --> 10:59.880]  off. The Sandy Hook mental patient who was up there and stole the AR 15 from his mom.
[11:01.400 --> 11:07.640]  It's always the same. And so they're getting ready to have their operatives,
[11:08.440 --> 11:17.240]  poses patriots and go out and bear spray people, go out and stab people, go out and run cars into
[11:17.240 --> 11:22.360]  people. And then it's going to escalate. And that's the plan. So Mike Adams joins us
[11:23.720 --> 11:27.400]  at the last segment of this hour, 30 minutes into the next hour. And then we're going to have the
[11:27.400 --> 11:34.760]  CNN whistleblower, Kerry porch joining us with new developments that Veritas hasn't released yet.
[11:34.760 --> 11:39.560]  And it's not Veritas's fault. They've got hundreds and hundreds and hundreds. I'm told it's approaching
[11:39.560 --> 11:44.760]  a thousand hours that this gentleman when he worked at CNN over a year or so recorded.
[11:44.760 --> 11:51.800]  And again, when you hear the audio and see the video, most of the CNN people are good. They're
[11:51.800 --> 11:55.640]  like, yeah, you can say what you want about Trump, but we're lying about him. We've sold our soul.
[11:56.200 --> 12:02.600]  We were told to lie. It's really horrible. The other ones are saying we've got to get Trump.
[12:02.600 --> 12:08.760]  I hope he dies. We've got to attack anybody that supports Trump. We got to bully people.
[12:08.760 --> 12:15.960]  It's really amazing. So he is going to have a lot to get to that hasn't been released yet
[12:15.960 --> 12:19.720]  by Veritas and just generally what it was like to be there and why he went public.
[12:20.680 --> 12:26.600]  He has a lot of courage. We look forward to Mr. Porch joining us coming up today.
[12:27.720 --> 12:31.960]  Then obviously we've got the latest on what sucks all the oxygen out of the room.
[12:31.960 --> 12:40.120]  Russia, hoax, witch hunt, 2.0. And we all know it's a lie. We all know it's a fraud.
[12:41.160 --> 12:46.680]  That isn't the issue here. The issue is that it's meant to suck all the oxygen out of the room so
[12:46.680 --> 12:51.640]  that while we're constantly debating each new lie they put out, we're not covering the corruption
[12:51.640 --> 12:56.200]  and the evil of the Democrats and the things that they're involved in. They're the corrupt.
[12:56.200 --> 12:59.400]  They're the ones that sold the nation out. They're the ones that got rich selling the country out.
[12:59.400 --> 13:07.720]  And they're able to change the subject onto Trump that he's the trader and he's selling
[13:07.720 --> 13:12.520]  us out to foreign powers because that's their weak spot. They're the ones that get their marching
[13:12.520 --> 13:18.760]  orders from the Chai comms and from multinational corporations that are anathetically opposed
[13:18.760 --> 13:25.320]  to America's existence. And the idea that the population should be diverse in ideas and diverse
[13:25.320 --> 13:32.040]  in economy and able to live our lives the way we see fit, these corporations crave cultural power
[13:32.040 --> 13:38.600]  over individuals above all things. So Trump demands deposition of corrupt Adam Schiff,
[13:38.600 --> 13:44.360]  Steve Watson writes for newswars.com. And he goes over the fact that they keep subpoenaing him.
[13:44.360 --> 13:50.600]  They keep coming after him because they've got this investigative power and that the executive,
[13:50.600 --> 13:55.240]  you know, needs people to go after them that they need to be calling the carpet for all the fraud
[13:55.240 --> 14:01.720]  they've been caught in. Also a big story at the Gateway Pundit, complete list, Adam Schiff's top
[14:01.720 --> 14:08.040]  witness Fiona Hill and her many connections to Soros and the deep state and sources infowars.com
[14:08.040 --> 14:13.080]  and newswars.com with our reports from two years ago. So good job there. It's good to have folks
[14:13.080 --> 14:16.040]  give us credit. It's not about us getting the credit. It's about people realizing
[14:18.200 --> 14:22.120]  in almost every case, we are the vanguard. We are the cutting edge and the enemy knows that.
[14:22.120 --> 14:26.600]  But they know we expose the illegal spying on the Trump campaign and then once he was elected,
[14:27.320 --> 14:31.320]  they know we expose the plan to not seat his delegates and keep him out of office and they
[14:31.320 --> 14:35.960]  know they know and they know that it's like media matters and the groups say they go,
[14:36.840 --> 14:41.480]  look, it starts on info wars and then it goes to Hannity and then it goes to Tucker Carlson and
[14:41.480 --> 14:45.800]  then it goes to Limbaugh and then it goes to the White House. We've got to shut info wars down
[14:45.800 --> 14:50.120]  because they know that nine times out of 10, we do the original research. In fact,
[14:50.120 --> 14:55.640]  the articles actually go first it's on info wars, then it's on drudge and then it's on talk radio
[14:55.640 --> 15:00.040]  and then it's on Fox and then they have congressional hearings where they talk about that like it's
[15:00.040 --> 15:06.840]  illegal or something, like it's wrong, like it's not good, like it's bad that we even exist. It's
[15:06.840 --> 15:12.600]  simply crazy. Mitt Romney got caught running a fake Twitter, a gnome to plumes, we could attack
[15:12.600 --> 15:17.640]  Trump while behaving like he isn't. This is really going to hurt him. Also the Chinese threat to free
[15:17.640 --> 15:23.320]  speech, big articles out about how it's taking even more control of US media. There is so much today
[15:24.040 --> 15:30.840]  we're going to be getting to and then just incredible school districts, brainwashing
[15:30.840 --> 15:37.480]  children into sexualization, just such child abuse. That's all coming up. Please don't forget if
[15:37.480 --> 15:41.800]  you're a TV viewer, especially you can see this. It's been a very popular shirt. I told you it would
[15:41.800 --> 15:46.440]  be a limited edition space force with the red, white, blue, American flag and info wars.com
[15:46.440 --> 15:50.840]  and we have finished the last run of these. It's a limited edition. It supports broadcast. If you
[15:50.840 --> 15:55.400]  want a space force shirt, we we're not making any more of this design of the shirt ever. It's
[15:55.400 --> 16:00.200]  limited edition. It funds the info war. You cannot lose unless you don't take action to get the great
[16:00.200 --> 16:06.840]  shirt. It's unisex. So that'll make the leftist happy. Get yours today. Most of you know that

[17:26.040 --> 17:30.200]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the east
[17:30.200 --> 17:34.520]  bank of the Mississippi. Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a
[17:34.520 --> 17:38.920]  temporary location and rather than move it back to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system
[17:38.920 --> 17:43.880]  at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory. So here's
[17:43.880 --> 17:49.480]  what you should do right now. Check out the PPX microgrid system at myownpowergrid.com. That's

[19:06.760 --> 19:11.560]  You probably never heard of preglonone, but you need to learn about it, believe me. As we age,
[19:11.560 --> 19:18.120]  preglonone levels decrease with age inside the body as much as 60% between the ages of 20 and
[19:18.120 --> 19:23.640]  75, making you tired and lazy. This is a missing link. With the real red pill formula and real
[19:23.640 --> 19:29.720]  red pill plus that has added energy, you can defy that test of time and keep your preglonone up
[19:29.720 --> 19:35.320]  for hormone balance, healthy aging and optimal cognitive function daily. Believe me folks,
[19:35.320 --> 19:40.120]  all of our information is gang changing, but real red pill and red pill plus are incredible.
[19:40.120 --> 19:46.520]  They're both available right now, even though they're fan favorites at infowarsstore.com for 50%
[19:46.520 --> 19:53.240]  off. This is an energy boosting formula with L-theanine, caffeine, and a whole bunch of other
[19:53.240 --> 19:59.320]  incredible ingredients with the preglonone at infowarslife.com. Again, that's the real red pill
[19:59.320 --> 20:04.360]  plus with the natural caffeine. Regular red pill just has the preglonone, all the vitamins
[20:04.360 --> 20:23.640]  and minerals together, but they're both amazing formulas. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:34.600 --> 20:42.280]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. I'm Alex Jones, your host. New story just went up on
[20:42.280 --> 20:50.760]  newswars.com. Kanye West says rap is the devil's music. Easy, also spiritually bothered by his
[20:50.760 --> 20:56.120]  wife's sexy image. A lot of folks are thinking that he is just pivoting and trying to get the
[20:56.120 --> 21:01.560]  Christian market, but he's actually been doing Christian music for about 10 years. So did Bob
[21:01.560 --> 21:08.520]  Marley. I think if you get older, you try to find redemption and sing songs of redemption. Maybe we
[21:08.520 --> 21:16.600]  should play that song by Bob Marley coming into the next segment. But I think we should give Kanye
[21:16.600 --> 21:21.880]  West time and see if he's for real. I know folks that know him, I think he is for real. And I know
[21:21.880 --> 21:29.720]  that he's a listener of this show and has really found fulfillment becoming a stronger Christian.
[21:29.720 --> 21:33.960]  And so I think those of us that kind of get mad at him and look down on him and some of the past
[21:33.960 --> 21:38.360]  things he's done, well, I think we should get the beams out of our eyes before he gets the
[21:38.360 --> 21:43.880]  speck out of his. That's why I don't plan to be perfect, but I love God and I love justice.
[21:43.880 --> 21:49.720]  And I don't look at people who sometimes might say a cuss word or get angry or drink a beer as a
[21:49.720 --> 21:56.520]  devil. I see people that don't stand up for the unborn, but then Bible thump all day and tell
[21:56.520 --> 22:02.520]  folks they're all going to hell. I see it as faith without works is dead. And of course, I believe
[22:02.520 --> 22:07.960]  in predestination and the fact that it's all by grace, but it doesn't matter if there's gas in
[22:07.960 --> 22:13.160]  the tank, the engine's going to start. If you love God, you're going to hate the devil. You're
[22:13.160 --> 22:19.160]  going to hate what's going on. Now, next segment, we never really got to this Friday because we
[22:19.160 --> 22:23.800]  didn't get back to town till 115. We didn't get to bed till past two. We had hours and hours
[22:23.800 --> 22:29.080]  and hours and hours of HD footage shot from five cameras. So we never really aired Friday.
[22:29.080 --> 22:35.640]  Any of the most powerful antifa encircling us, attacking us, attacking others. When I rode in
[22:35.640 --> 22:42.360]  in the armored vehicle, which did form as a nice photo op during the sunset, kind of the archetypal
[22:42.360 --> 22:48.760]  symbol of speech persevering. That was just the vehicle that the security up in Dallas had.
[22:48.760 --> 22:53.400]  We said, sure, it's got a turret in the top. I can bullhorn. It's powerful. So we're going to
[22:53.400 --> 23:02.040]  premiere the best compilation of that footage next segment. The articles up on info wars.com
[23:02.040 --> 23:06.200]  Alex Jones attends Dallas rally in armored vehicle. That's got all the old footage. We're going to
[23:06.200 --> 23:12.360]  upload and add this new compilation. That's the best to that article in the next 10, 15 minutes
[23:12.360 --> 23:18.680]  and repost it to info wars.com. So that's coming up next segment. But this is something really
[23:18.680 --> 23:24.520]  important that I haven't talked enough about. I mentioned it some and the leftist controlled CIA
[23:25.320 --> 23:32.680]  and the Carnegie Foundation and CNN and MSNBC and media matters and George Soros,
[23:32.680 --> 23:42.600]  Huffington Post, Atlantic Monthly, the Atlantic group. They've all had hearings and said that we
[23:42.600 --> 23:49.480]  track the vector point of the virus to Alex Jones. And it's true. They see us as a virus,
[23:50.040 --> 23:56.120]  pro God, pro family, pro country, pro human expansion into the universe, a pro human future.
[23:56.120 --> 24:02.760]  We're into free will. We're into success. We're into beauty. We're into God. And
[24:04.280 --> 24:09.880]  when you listen to Limbaugh or Hannity, they have adopted this show because it's the truth.
[24:09.880 --> 24:16.280]  Our worldview is accurate. Our worldview is right. You have spread the show. Matt Drudge has spread
[24:16.280 --> 24:20.760]  the show. Our affiliates have done a great job. Our crews done a great job. So our greatest success
[24:23.000 --> 24:26.520]  is that I'll have a guest on and another guest will call them say, you know, that guest was
[24:26.520 --> 24:30.600]  reading an article Paul Watson wrote a year ago, word for word, or, you know, that's a Mike Adams
[24:30.600 --> 24:34.040]  article, or you know, that's something you said six years ago, word for word. I said, I know,
[24:34.040 --> 24:39.480]  that's leadership. We want people to adopt what we're saying and doing as if it's their own,
[24:39.480 --> 24:42.840]  because it is their own. We don't territorialize information.
[24:46.840 --> 24:53.240]  We're here to change the world and sell an idea of liberty and freedom versus the post human
[24:53.960 --> 25:01.480]  exterminist, neural order, satanic view. But yes, I want listeners understand why M4s is critical.
[25:01.480 --> 25:08.040]  Everywhere I go, I shake probably a hundred hands for every person that says F you Russian agent,
[25:08.040 --> 25:15.080]  F you Trump supporter, we're going to kill you unless I go to a Trump rally. And then I take a
[25:15.080 --> 25:19.880]  lot even more hands, but then there's also Antifa and leftist and they all look like mental patients.
[25:20.840 --> 25:25.080]  They all surround us, spit on us, cuss at us, even when I have security, punch me in the ribs,
[25:25.080 --> 25:31.000]  slap me in the head, throw water bottles at me. These are un-American dangerous authoritarians.
[25:32.360 --> 25:37.880]  But they've been told by the media establishment to hate me because the enemy knows M4 wars
[25:37.880 --> 25:43.320]  set the fires politically that burned down large parts of the new world order that's now spread
[25:43.320 --> 25:49.080]  worldwide, 1776 worldwide. That's because you supported the broadcast by spreading the word and
[25:49.080 --> 25:56.040]  by financially supporting us. And so these leftist scream out at me. You're a Russian agent.
[25:56.760 --> 26:00.200]  You're a Nazi. You can't shouldn't question Sandy Hook.
[26:02.120 --> 26:06.760]  And they also say, ha ha, you're off the air. You're a failure. You're off Facebook, YouTube,
[26:06.760 --> 26:12.120]  Twitter. Like they're so proud of it. I was already shadow banned on that years before they
[26:12.120 --> 26:17.400]  officially banned us. I came from nowhere. I didn't go sell out to the system to get a show.
[26:17.400 --> 26:22.360]  And then I'm taking off the year. I built something organic with the listeners of this show.
[26:23.720 --> 26:27.080]  And that's why it's so important. And that's why they hate its existence. And
[26:28.200 --> 26:33.640]  I can tell you that hundreds of members of Congress listened to the show. I can tell you that all
[26:33.640 --> 26:39.720]  the other big talk show hosts. Producers listen, just like Matt Drudge is in every newsroom and
[26:39.720 --> 26:46.280]  every talk radio area, because it's a lot of news well laid out. He gets the pulse, the zeitgeist,
[26:46.280 --> 26:53.320]  and just really shows what the zeitgeist is. So Drudge is in all the newsrooms as the copy editor.
[26:53.880 --> 27:00.520]  Well, info wars is the broadcast of that. Or the profit of the Tea Party, as Newsweek said
[27:00.520 --> 27:05.800]  eight years ago, accurately back when it was still Newsweek. So that's why we're important.
[27:05.800 --> 27:09.640]  That's why staying on air is important. So one of our great engineers who's running the board
[27:09.640 --> 27:15.240]  today, while folks are on vacation, he doubles down CJ been there many years. He just said,
[27:15.240 --> 27:19.000]  you need to hammer that. You don't hammer that enough that he says, I listened to all the talk
[27:19.000 --> 27:23.240]  radio and word for word. We'll just say it in your own words, CJ. Go ahead. Basically, I thought
[27:23.240 --> 27:28.520]  that you can't really emphasize enough how much your talking points get carried. And I think
[27:28.520 --> 27:32.680]  the listeners need to realize that when they hear something you said, it's not you just saying
[27:32.680 --> 27:37.240]  something else that you heard somebody else say. It's your words. It's your research. I hear
[27:37.240 --> 27:41.800]  Rush Limbaugh every day because I listen to him on the radio instead of using my phone to consume
[27:41.800 --> 27:46.760]  data. And it makes me chuckle because he's saying the same things you said two months ago. And it's
[27:46.760 --> 27:51.480]  particularly about American freedoms and the attacks on our liberties because he's gotten in
[27:51.480 --> 27:55.720]  that vein because it's popular. People are afraid of losing their liberties. And he's getting
[27:55.720 --> 27:59.800]  talking points from you because you're ringing the alarm bell. You're the Paul Revere. He's just,
[28:00.760 --> 28:05.640]  I'm not going to say anything derogatory, but he's just basically robbing your audience of,
[28:06.680 --> 28:10.120]  or robbing his audience of the opportunity of hearing you say it and said he's saying it.
[28:11.800 --> 28:18.360]  But CJ, imitation is the most sincere form of flattery. And so I love that. And I don't even
[28:18.360 --> 28:23.000]  say that Limbaugh stealing my shtick is not a shtick. I see the globalist. I know the Chai
[28:23.000 --> 28:27.720]  Com takeover. I know their post human plan because I'm reading their white papers. I'm simply putting
[28:27.720 --> 28:33.320]  it out and people know that's real now. And the fact that whether it's Tucker Carlson, who puts
[28:33.320 --> 28:39.400]  his own spin on things, very intellectual, whether it's Sean Hannity, I am very honored by that.
[28:39.400 --> 28:45.080]  I just want the audience to know by the products, by the videos, by the water filtration, the non-GMO
[28:45.080 --> 28:51.800]  heirloom seeds, get them all because without you, this fortress of information and truth that
[28:51.800 --> 28:56.440]  literally is changing the world can be taken down. We don't reach as much of the unwashed masses
[28:56.440 --> 29:01.640]  as we once did. But when it comes to the halls of power around the world, they know we are the
[29:01.640 --> 29:29.400]  zeitgeist of truth and they're listening and staying on air is absolutely essential.
[29:29.400 --> 29:34.680]  My blood pressure has normalized. My diabetes has totally improved. Everyone is telling me now how
[29:34.680 --> 29:38.680]  much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel. I recommend heart and
[29:38.680 --> 29:43.960]  body extract to everyone. Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using
[29:43.960 --> 29:48.680]  this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy. Order your two

[30:07.160 --> 30:14.120]  My friends, I've seen a lot of Donald Trump just like you have. And my goodness, yesterday's press
[30:14.120 --> 30:19.000]  conference, when they came in on him with all their garbage, the foreign reporters, the U.S.
[30:19.000 --> 30:25.160]  reporters, these little political sellouts, these whores, he just tore them to bits. And it's one
[30:25.160 --> 30:30.840]  thing to hear out of your radio listeners. It's powerful. But if you see it, it's all at band.video.
[30:30.840 --> 30:36.280]  You've got the full press conference. We've got my boil down of how epic it is. It's all at band.video.
[30:36.280 --> 30:41.400]  And I just, you've got to share this with people because Trump was hitting on all 45 cylinders.
[30:41.400 --> 30:46.440]  This was amazing. And he turned the nitrous oxide on top of it. So in full wars, America,
[30:46.440 --> 30:51.480]  Trump, all of us, incredible things are happening. And we're sharing the ideas that are going to
[30:51.480 --> 30:57.400]  defeat the tyrants at band.video. And I got to tell you, we've done great video work. We've done
[30:57.400 --> 31:02.280]  great films. We've done so much. But websites are not our thing. Well, now they are. I'm so proud
[31:02.280 --> 31:08.440]  of band.video, folks. Check it out. There's a lot of new features band.video. I've been in this fight
[31:08.440 --> 31:14.040]  so long. It's a globalist that I forget sometimes we really came from nowhere and that we've changed
[31:14.040 --> 31:19.720]  the world together. And just how important your actions and my actions are every day in this fight.
[31:19.720 --> 31:23.800]  And right now we're running a gigantic sale, store-wide free shipping, double paid free of

[32:04.760 --> 32:10.360]  supplements and for store.com. I've got to really hand it to the listeners and viewers who enforce
[32:11.240 --> 32:17.640]  your support and your help in rebooting Americana is a challenge to the globalist system of corporate
[32:17.640 --> 32:23.240]  tyranny has really caught hold not just here in the US but worldwide and President Trump's
[32:23.240 --> 32:28.520]  fearlessness when it comes to promoting Americana and basic liberty is amazing as well.
[32:29.080 --> 32:34.200]  He's still lacking on the big tech censorship taking action against that in some other areas.
[32:34.200 --> 32:38.200]  But trying to end the wars boosting our economy speaking out against communist China
[32:38.840 --> 32:43.720]  Trump's been doing an amazing job but now more than ever we really have to realize that
[32:44.440 --> 32:50.280]  we're being targeted because we are effective and the globalists are beginning to lose their war
[32:51.000 --> 32:54.920]  against humanity in a big way and so we're going to see some major fireworks out of them
[32:54.920 --> 33:00.760]  but it's critical to not let ourselves get down when we see all the poison they spray at us.
[33:00.760 --> 33:05.960]  That's an attempt to demoralize us. We've got to remember that and stay focused and stay happy.
[33:05.960 --> 33:35.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show now I don't
[33:35.800 --> 33:40.520]  want to take away from info wars but I'm going to do it. I'm going to explain something.
[33:41.640 --> 33:45.480]  The truth is people like Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson and
[33:46.200 --> 33:50.040]  Rush Limbaugh are smart guys and they know all the stuff I've been covering is true.
[33:51.000 --> 33:55.160]  But in the old days if you talked about the CFR wanting to get rid of America and have a
[33:55.160 --> 34:00.840]  Chinese century or how China was buying up Hollywood 20 years ago you would get taken off the air by
[34:00.840 --> 34:09.320]  the conservative companies that were really owned by globalist companies. So there was never a truly
[34:09.320 --> 34:15.080]  independent grassroots organization that on a big platform on hundreds of radio stations
[34:15.080 --> 34:22.040]  and now TV stations could do it and so all across the country we would go on small stations big
[34:22.040 --> 34:26.840]  stations you name it and end up being the number one or number two show very quickly from stations
[34:26.840 --> 34:34.280]  that had no ratings. That was our big revolution really of the last 20 years. It's been 25 years
[34:34.280 --> 34:40.280]  I've been on air but now people need to listen and understand when I tell you that the globalists
[34:40.280 --> 34:45.240]  believe they're being communicated with by interdimensional creatures the aliens don't come
[34:45.240 --> 34:49.320]  in flying saucers and that the aliens are telling them you've got to build this tech
[34:49.320 --> 34:54.840]  world government and then forcibly reduce population to become AI gods. I told you
[34:54.840 --> 35:01.400]  that 20 years ago I put that in a film 12 years ago now Elon Musk talks about it now the head
[35:01.400 --> 35:07.240]  of Bank of America says we live in a simulation run by aliens. Now Joe Rogan you know has the
[35:07.240 --> 35:12.120]  biggest show in the world and has professors on going well we're declassifying that we have like
[35:12.120 --> 35:19.720]  astronauts mapping on DMT at facilities communicating with the aliens and Joe's like yes I communicate
[35:19.720 --> 35:27.240]  with the aliens but I'm the weirdo because I won't take DMT and talk to the aliens and I'm
[35:27.240 --> 35:33.160]  exposing that they think they're talking to aliens that are called in the old days demons
[35:33.160 --> 35:37.880]  genies whatever you want to call it. So I knew all this stuff a long time ago and kind of eat
[35:37.880 --> 35:42.760]  around the edges of it 15 20 years ago the last five or six I just say it all because we don't have
[35:42.760 --> 35:48.360]  much time left here and you can say well I don't believe in all that well they believe in it and
[35:48.360 --> 35:54.440]  they're coming after your kids to sexualize them and they're openly saying occult is their religion
[35:54.440 --> 35:59.560]  and satanism. So I want to get to this video report Rob do put together some of the compilations and
[35:59.560 --> 36:05.160]  and then we're going to have Mike Adams in here with Antifa openly funded by Soros getting ready
[36:05.160 --> 36:09.400]  to stage major attacks and blame it on us and we've got more articles today confirming what Mike
[36:09.400 --> 36:15.640]  wrote about this giant report for info wars.com that's also where it posted at naturalnews.com
[36:15.640 --> 36:21.640]  and I'm going to ask the web guys to repost his big article 18 page article alert Antifa
[36:21.640 --> 36:26.520]  puppet masters to engineer Patriot slaughter of leftist to spark violent uprising against
[36:26.520 --> 36:33.000]  conservatives back to the front page of info wars.com but CJ wanted to add some more when we
[36:33.000 --> 36:37.080]  went to break he's like look I understand it's good to have them repeating what you say it's
[36:37.080 --> 36:41.960]  just that we need to get credit for this so the listeners understand that that that we're literally
[36:41.960 --> 36:47.640]  being pounded because we're so vital in this fight and I'm not bragging the enemy knows we're vital
[36:47.640 --> 36:52.360]  the enemy knows if we were a fighter bomber in world war two we've got like a hundred shot down
[36:52.360 --> 36:57.800]  planes on our side and they're looking for us they're gunning for us okay I mean that's what
[36:57.800 --> 37:02.200]  I'm like we were a sniper that you know had a hundred kills the enemies got bounties out on
[37:02.200 --> 37:06.920]  our ass you understand they got new york times reporters camped out trying to pay people off
[37:06.920 --> 37:12.680]  to make up stuff I mean it's serious folks and I'm not a victim I'm a leader I just want you to
[37:12.680 --> 37:17.240]  know that we are important and I know you know that but I want to thank you all and just say

[37:36.520 --> 37:40.200]  know we're just going to do this and be completely humble about it I'm not trying to be prideful
[37:40.200 --> 37:45.480]  but folks need to remember that there's more than just uh more than just a handful of people in the
[37:45.480 --> 37:49.560]  fight we are all in this together because we have to stop it or else we're our future's over that's
[37:49.560 --> 37:54.520]  it and I think you're saying it right there in that everybody that works here knows I'm up here
[37:54.520 --> 37:59.320]  seven days a week and everybody knows how serious it is we don't get in all the stuff that goes on
[37:59.320 --> 38:03.880]  and people that live this every day know we're not bs-ing and it's like hey America wake up
[38:03.880 --> 38:08.200]  getting the fight Trump's been tweeting saying hey republicans help me we've got criminals
[38:08.200 --> 38:11.960]  we've got to remove the deep state help me indict them he's publicly trying to get the
[38:11.960 --> 38:17.400]  justice department to stop being cowards we're going to lose everything if we keep being cowards
[38:17.400 --> 38:22.200]  we've reached that point the old days being a coward for the last 50 years got you ahead maybe
[38:22.200 --> 38:28.280]  now it's going to get our goose cooked CJ anything else no you said it you said it I just I just uh

[38:35.640 --> 38:38.760]  just have people say the worst things about you and that's what they spread around the news and
[38:39.480 --> 38:45.880]  the whole truth of everything you say 99% of the time is being omitted well here's the good news
[38:45.880 --> 38:49.320]  is it there's there's there's a lot of good people that know the truth out there I know and
[38:49.320 --> 38:52.120]  anytime you're telling the truth in history you're going to be attacked God bless you CJ

[43:24.520 --> 43:28.600]  washington post comes out and says they hope that gg ping the dictator of china will quote
[43:28.600 --> 43:35.400]  destroy trump that's a headline show info wars has been the paul revere this operation we have
[43:35.400 --> 43:40.440]  blown the whistle continuously and have been proven right and that's why it's more important than ever
[43:40.440 --> 43:45.640]  that we override silicon valley and their chai com masters by word of mouth and spread the word
[43:45.640 --> 43:51.240]  about info wars and check out info war store dot com that's where the arsenal of our republic
[43:51.240 --> 44:11.240]  is being funded that's where the tip of the spear is continually being forged is info or store dot com

[45:46.200 --> 45:53.080]  percent off this is an energy boosting formula with l-theanine caffeine and a whole bunch of
[45:53.080 --> 45:59.400]  other incredible ingredients with the preglonone at infowarslife.com again that's the real red pill

[46:08.840 --> 46:14.360]  info wars on the air everything we've warned of is now being exposed and is out in the open
[46:14.360 --> 46:20.680]  want to be clear it's not coming true it was already true i didn't predict all this it was
[46:20.680 --> 46:26.360]  already going on now the globalists are making their move with the chikoms so it's naked it's
[46:26.360 --> 46:32.120]  brazen this is the point when the enemy emerges it's like before world war two the polls kept
[46:32.120 --> 46:36.520]  warning that nazi germany was going to attack them nobody believed them as they saw the troop
[46:36.520 --> 46:42.760]  smashing until it finally happened we're at that same point and we're all paul reviers who need to
[46:42.760 --> 46:48.200]  be out there warning everyone about what's unfolding because this is the critical fight and thank god
[46:48.200 --> 46:54.920]  america and the world is waking up at the eleventh hour 58 minute but will it be too little too
[46:54.920 --> 47:00.520]  late that's up to you this battle's hot it's real so spread the word and support info wars today
[47:00.520 --> 47:05.240]  at infowarstore.com but whatever you do spread the word about the live transmission
[47:09.960 --> 47:12.600]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[47:12.600 --> 47:25.160]  all pirates yesterday rob i sold i to the merchant ships
[47:27.400 --> 47:38.360]  minutes after date to guy from the bottom lists but my hand was made strong
[47:38.360 --> 47:47.240]  by the end of the almighty we forward in this generation
[47:49.080 --> 47:54.680]  triumph and plea won't you help just him
[47:57.480 --> 48:05.160]  these songs are freed on welcome back i'm i'm gonna play the rest of the boil down
[48:05.160 --> 48:09.960]  from the trump rally later in the fourth hour i'm gonna take about 15 minutes from solenta
[48:09.960 --> 48:14.040]  you'll be fine with that to finish up with that report because i want to give mike adams as much
[48:14.040 --> 48:22.440]  time as we can in the next 40 minutes or so before the cnn whistleblower carrie porch joins us and
[48:22.440 --> 48:28.360]  this is not project veritas holding anything back it's close to a thousand hours that mr porch taped
[48:28.360 --> 48:35.080]  and so it's something like 50 reports have been released so far that are all just insane
[48:36.040 --> 48:41.880]  and reportedly they think there's probably a hundred more because again veritas is like us
[48:41.880 --> 48:49.240]  you know they've got like 50 people or something um and they a lot of that's legal and production and
[48:49.240 --> 48:55.960]  then you know just going through it all a lot more is coming out of what goes on inside cnn so
[48:55.960 --> 49:00.600]  that's bottom of the next hour i'm gonna look at some of the biggest news that has come out so far
[49:00.600 --> 49:05.960]  but he'll get into some of the footage that's not been released yet and uh looks like he'll probably
[49:05.960 --> 49:16.040]  be in studio on wednesday but let me just say this very very calmly tribalism is real the term
[49:16.040 --> 49:22.120]  racism the communists invented that to then teach people that if you like your own group and are
[49:22.120 --> 49:26.120]  proud of your own culture that that's bad that you're supposed to give up your culture to the
[49:26.120 --> 49:30.200]  globalist corporate culture that's what multiculturalism is is just making sure you're totally alone
[49:30.200 --> 49:35.320]  and have no roots they want to break up the family break up women from men make sure children
[49:35.320 --> 49:43.160]  are awards of the state that's all official now um extension rebellion group you know says no our
[49:43.160 --> 49:48.280]  plan is to end heterosexuality in the family they claim they want to protect children no they want
[49:48.280 --> 49:55.560]  to sexualize and uh you know attack and and and inject with deadly vaccines and and gmo's
[49:55.560 --> 49:59.320]  the children they're unable to kill that's their plan and now it's out in the open
[50:00.920 --> 50:07.320]  and it's the horror of this that we're going to have to admit to ourselves but when you look at
[50:08.040 --> 50:12.360]  the the the tribalism that's been drummed up by the media and by the left
[50:12.360 --> 50:17.720]  it's also humans are at each other's throats
[50:20.040 --> 50:24.680]  so we're going to talk about mike adam's big report right now for three segments or so
[50:25.400 --> 50:29.960]  but then he really is an engineer and a really top expert because i do my research i don't want
[50:29.960 --> 50:34.920]  somebody knows what they're talking about and he's right up there at the top on the plan the
[50:34.920 --> 50:41.080]  post-human era and how it's not just elon musk zuckerberg came out and said we've got a better
[50:41.080 --> 50:47.400]  brain chip than him so just like all these in-home devices you bring in that spy on you and all this
[50:47.400 --> 50:50.840]  there's a good 10 15 percent of the public that if you sell something at a store
[50:52.440 --> 50:58.600]  like it's just normal and no big deal people will get it and that's why elon musk four months ago
[50:58.600 --> 51:05.880]  said oh 2020 we're gonna have it malls instead of a tesla dealership they'll have a dealership where
[51:05.880 --> 51:12.360]  you go in and they sell you on wires being put in your brain and then you go in the back and
[51:12.360 --> 51:16.200]  there's a robot that does it and you're like why would they do something so invasive like it's no
[51:16.200 --> 51:21.480]  big deal like getting your ears pierced that's the whole point is to make it oh this isn't medical
[51:22.280 --> 51:27.720]  this isn't like getting a tooth pulled or getting open heart surgery this is a corporation putting
[51:27.720 --> 51:35.240]  wires into your brain and musk says it will take you over and laughs so it's the hidden in plain
[51:35.240 --> 51:42.120]  view tactic that they use so i'm going to get mike's take on that here's the headline this is an
[51:42.120 --> 51:49.240]  nbc this is an abc it's in the daily star it's all being pushed right now today scientists use
[51:49.240 --> 51:56.920]  brains with ai implants to give people superhuman intelligence uh-huh hey use this heroin you'll
[51:56.920 --> 52:03.960]  feel like superman uh this is total enslavement and that they're going to tell you well then well
[52:03.960 --> 52:08.920]  the new iphone you know the new iphone 20 in a few years it's not going to work unless you've got
[52:08.920 --> 52:13.800]  this i mean that's what they say they're going to do it's a diabolical it's alien to this planet
[52:15.240 --> 52:21.640]  you know if zuckerberg getting a human hybrid with something i'm a monkey's uncle okay take one
[52:21.640 --> 52:27.480]  look at that guy i tell you he ain't from Kansas okay he ain't from nowhere around here so there's
[52:27.480 --> 52:32.920]  some big stuff going on here and his whole thing rolling out is the post-human world and if you
[52:32.920 --> 52:36.520]  believe the bible there's going to be a world leader that's going to kill a bunch of people that
[52:36.520 --> 52:42.920]  don't take it well you know what kiss my ass satan i'm not taking it so that's coming up next hour
[52:42.920 --> 52:48.360]  just briefly here before as we introduce mike with this huge story i keep meaning to do a whole
[52:48.360 --> 52:54.920]  report on air hoping that you fund our operation while at the same time semi-autically really

[54:24.280 --> 54:30.200]  other articles here uh pregnant mothers and the dangers of iodine deficiency the one in guardian
[54:31.880 --> 54:36.520]  and it just goes on from their effects of drinking water with iodine concentration of the
[54:36.520 --> 54:40.680]  intelligence of children and again china did big studies on this and found the icu's just keep
[54:40.680 --> 54:45.160]  growing and growing meanwhile daily beast fluoridation water during pregnancy like a lower iq
[54:45.160 --> 54:50.280]  study published in the journal american medicine listen to me the people running the show want to
[54:50.280 --> 54:57.320]  post human world i'm going to show you mainstream news calling for all of that later with mike
[54:57.320 --> 55:04.200]  adams but introducing the big story now is mike adams but i'm going to tell you get your iodine
[55:04.200 --> 55:09.800]  get your selenium it goes with it it's how your body operates if you want energy if you want stamina
[55:09.800 --> 55:15.560]  if you want clarity take the iodine my god it's incredible but if you've already been on the
[55:15.560 --> 55:20.120]  bad stuff it fills all your glands it could be rocky going on the iodine talk to your physician
[55:20.120 --> 55:24.360]  i'm just telling you the enemy doesn't want you to take it and they sure as hell don't want you to
[55:24.360 --> 55:29.480]  buy products from us selenium will blow you away iodine clean iodine will blow you away
[55:29.480 --> 55:33.720]  do the challenge if you already know about how great iodine is go out and proselytize others
[55:33.720 --> 55:39.720]  tell them warn them in foreshore.com 361 okay let's stop there mike this is so
[55:39.720 --> 55:43.720]  huge when i read your report yesterday it came out 30 minutes before i went on air
[55:43.720 --> 55:48.200]  i could barely do the show because there's so many that's documented so many plans but
[55:48.200 --> 55:53.320]  bottom line antifa is openly organizing and admitting plans to stage attacks against people
[55:53.320 --> 55:57.240]  to blame on trump supporters that's what we do if we were them i mean i wouldn't morally do that
[55:57.240 --> 56:01.640]  but if you get in their mind that's the logical move the same deep state's been caught before
[56:01.640 --> 56:06.840]  but you've really collated at naturalnews.com a blueprint for law enforcement and others to
[56:06.840 --> 56:11.240]  understand what is already happening and what's coming and even more stuff broke today confirming
[56:11.240 --> 56:15.880]  what you wrote over the weekend that i know took you three days to put together where they've got a
[56:15.880 --> 56:21.960]  database targeting people they call racist that's any trump supporter with a hit list of our homes
[56:21.960 --> 56:26.840]  so mike adams we're going to break in a moment but tell us what's coming up well we we have completely
[56:26.840 --> 56:32.040]  decoded the psychology of the globalist so that that's the bottom line we know their playbook now
[56:32.040 --> 56:37.560]  and i gotta give you credit alex i mean i quoted you in the article you have spearheaded this you've
[56:37.560 --> 56:43.640]  allowed researchers like me to be able to put the pieces of the puzzle together and if you weren't
[56:43.640 --> 56:48.680]  digging into this probably i wouldn't be digging into this either but we thanks to your work and
[56:48.680 --> 56:54.920]  all of us together we now know the the exact playbook we in fact i ran about 24 scenarios of
[56:54.920 --> 57:01.320]  how they would try to defeat trump and cause mass chaos and civil unrest and so on and the the one
[57:01.320 --> 57:07.880]  scenario that fit all the criteria is the scenario that i outlined in that report that's their preferred
[57:07.880 --> 57:12.040]  method that's how they're going to get the most bang for their buck so to speak so i know we're
[57:12.040 --> 57:17.480]  going to break shortly but when we come back i'll dig into it we'll go into the details of why that
[57:17.480 --> 57:24.200]  scenario is the most likely scenario and what it means for the future of our country so uh
[57:24.200 --> 57:28.280]  everything is at stake as you know so i know you'll probably take us out to break here but
[57:28.280 --> 57:32.840]  uh so actually mike i'm gonna i'm in the next three segments i'm gonna really just try to let
[57:32.840 --> 57:36.440]  you host i've kind of just set it up there and i want you to talk about it and then we're gonna
[57:36.440 --> 57:40.520]  know the post-human world they're now openly announcing won't it be great we're all gone won't

[59:07.960 --> 59:13.480]  has really caught hold not just here in the u.s worldwide and president trump's fearlessness
[59:13.480 --> 59:19.400]  when it comes to promoting americana and basic liberty is amazing as well he's still lacking
[59:19.400 --> 59:24.760]  on the big tech censorship taking action against that in some other areas but tried to end the
[59:24.760 --> 59:29.400]  wars boosting our economy speaking out against communist china trump's been doing an amazing
[59:29.400 --> 59:35.880]  job but now more than ever we really have to realize that we're being targeted because we are
[59:35.880 --> 59:42.280]  effective and the globalists are beginning to lose their war against humanity in a big way and so
[59:42.280 --> 59:47.640]  we're going to see some major fireworks out of them but it's critical to not let ourselves get down
[59:47.640 --> 59:53.480]  when we see all the poison they spray at us that's an attempt to demoralize us we've got to remember
[59:53.480 --> 1:00:13.400]  that and stay focused and stay happy you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:00:13.400 --> 1:00:27.080]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well so does he lie
[1:00:27.080 --> 1:00:34.760]  from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones all right mike adams launch into your 18 page
[1:00:34.760 --> 1:00:39.960]  report with new articles out today confirming what you said on sunday the story's been reposted
[1:00:39.960 --> 1:00:44.360]  the front page of info wars dot com don't share it from there as much that gets blocked share it
[1:00:44.360 --> 1:00:50.280]  from news wars dot com and natural news dot com banned out video as well um that has a breakdown of
[1:00:50.280 --> 1:00:56.440]  it alert antifa puppet masters to engineer patriots swatter of leftist to spark violent
[1:00:56.440 --> 1:01:00.840]  uprising against conservatives we enter the season of false flags i'll tell you what we just saw in
[1:01:00.840 --> 1:01:06.520]  california with the bear spray we're looking into that very suspicious take it over mike adams okay i'm
[1:01:06.520 --> 1:01:10.520]  gonna get right into it uh i apologize up front but i've got to add something else about your
[1:01:10.520 --> 1:01:15.400]  transhumanism uh discussion you know you you see how these leftists are saying there's no such thing
[1:01:15.400 --> 1:01:21.560]  as biology that men can have periods now or i think it was hillary and and chelsea said that
[1:01:22.280 --> 1:01:28.120]  a person with a beard and a penis can be a woman for example children that it's it's
[1:01:28.120 --> 1:01:33.480]  abusing their minds sorry go ahead absolutely well the question is if biology doesn't matter and you
[1:01:33.480 --> 1:01:39.800]  can choose to be whatever you want then why aren't progressives solving the species extinction problem
[1:01:39.800 --> 1:01:45.960]  by choosing to give birth to endangered animals such as eagles or polar bears they think even though
[1:01:45.960 --> 1:01:50.680]  polar bear populations are exploding why do you have to if you're a progressive why do you have to
[1:01:50.680 --> 1:01:55.720]  give birth to a human being if you can choose to be a man or a woman then why can't you choose to
[1:01:55.720 --> 1:02:01.240]  give birth to any animal you want so they deserve the blame for species extinction because they are
[1:02:01.240 --> 1:02:06.200]  not giving birth to the animals that they want to save so they're raising war on sanity because no one
[1:02:06.200 --> 1:02:10.200]  would want to post human world and to be keeping babies alive and selling their organs and taking
[1:02:10.200 --> 1:02:15.240]  brain chips so they have to make it cool to be foolish and to divorce yourself and to ask for
[1:02:15.240 --> 1:02:19.560]  a grand delusion and then god turns you over to the spirit of delusion they are literally
[1:02:19.560 --> 1:02:25.480]  engaged in a ritual assaulting reality yes it is mass mental illness and this is what we see of
[1:02:25.480 --> 1:02:30.600]  course always before the end of civilizations when things start to crater this mass mental illness
[1:02:30.600 --> 1:02:36.360]  now the second thing about transhumanism interfacing computers with your brain remember that the last
[1:02:36.360 --> 1:02:40.920]  refuge of personal privacy right now is the privacy of your own thoughts inside your own head
[1:02:41.640 --> 1:02:47.240]  inside your mind and that is the barrier that they're trying to break now this is not about
[1:02:47.240 --> 1:02:53.960]  augmenting human beings it's about controlling human beings and creating a new vector to impregnate
[1:02:53.960 --> 1:02:59.320]  your consciousness with the information that they want to push so this is about controlling your
[1:02:59.320 --> 1:03:05.880]  reality by invading the last barrier you have the privacy of your own thoughts if your thoughts are
[1:03:05.880 --> 1:03:10.600]  not even private if your thoughts are not even your own then who are you you lose your identity
[1:03:10.600 --> 1:03:15.960]  as a human being and you join the borg system and that's what they're trying to create the mark
[1:03:15.960 --> 1:03:22.120]  zuckerberg post humanism borg system and there's a scientist out there right now alex who is about
[1:03:22.120 --> 1:03:29.080]  to die and he believes he's going to be transformed into a computer that he's going to be uploaded
[1:03:29.080 --> 1:03:34.440]  that he's going to become version 2.0 of himself i forgot his name i'm sorry james lovelock and
[1:03:34.440 --> 1:03:39.720]  others are pushing that and it's all a total fraud where they didn't go oh look he's really in the
[1:03:39.720 --> 1:03:46.200]  computer but no it's only a ai computer mimicking you that's right they're going to kill him and
[1:03:46.200 --> 1:03:51.560]  then have an avatar in the computer that they claim is him and the avatar will also claim hey it's me
[1:03:51.560 --> 1:03:57.800]  here i am version 2.0 this will be let's be clear the very company you're right says oh unfortunately
[1:03:57.800 --> 1:04:06.600]  you have to die in the process yes yes it's all mass fraud from the beginning right well well
[1:04:06.600 --> 1:04:12.120]  liberals may sign up for that they may line up to be transhumanized so that their their physical
[1:04:12.120 --> 1:04:17.800]  bodies are killed off and they're uploaded to machines where they can contain the plan that's
[1:04:17.800 --> 1:04:23.000]  the game plan it's always been the game plan that is the luciferian deal and it's all a fraud it's
[1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:29.080]  all a lie yeah so and lastly about iodine a quick story i know we're about to go to break
[1:04:29.080 --> 1:04:35.160]  a few years ago we tried to investigate making iodine a transdermal patches and we were told
[1:04:35.160 --> 1:04:40.040]  by our attorneys that we should not pursue that because the FDA would shut it down because doing
[1:04:40.040 --> 1:04:45.480]  transdermal delivery which iodine does very well by the way they said would be considered a drug so
[1:04:45.480 --> 1:04:51.320]  there is actually an FDA conspiracy to shut down iodine people you should get it while you can
[1:04:51.320 --> 1:04:54.840]  because i don't know how long they're going to allow you to get it as a dietary supplement
[1:04:55.480 --> 1:04:58.920]  you know it's crazy you say that i just remember we're about to go to break but i when i was a
[1:04:58.920 --> 1:05:03.640]  kid i do this rich lady and she would put it in oil and rub it on her skin put it right back stay
[1:05:03.640 --> 1:05:10.040]  with us silicon valley thinks you're the dumb jellyfish they think the west is dead they think
[1:05:10.040 --> 1:05:13.560]  if they censor nationalist and patriots off the internet you'll just forget about us and then
[1:05:13.560 --> 1:05:17.720]  they'll be the only information out there well so far that's not been working too well for them
[1:05:17.720 --> 1:05:23.160]  thanks to you spreading the word steadfastly but the resistance to globalism is alive and well

[1:06:00.920 --> 1:06:16.840]  you to unleash its full potential band.video
[1:06:22.760 --> 1:06:26.760]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[1:06:26.760 --> 1:06:36.040]  alive from the info wars.com studios it's alex jones you can see it everything in the 25 year
[1:06:36.040 --> 1:06:43.480]  trajectory of info wars towards this point 2020 the global rebellion against the new world order
[1:06:43.480 --> 1:06:49.480]  against globalism against the post-human era mike adams of natural news.com has done a superlative
[1:06:49.480 --> 1:06:58.120]  job in a very detailed report that is vital to get out antifa puppet masters engineer patriot
[1:06:58.120 --> 1:07:04.520]  slaughter of leftist to spark violent uprising against conservatives and now we've caught them
[1:07:04.520 --> 1:07:09.960]  with an app that targets everybody that supports basically trump for their homes saying they're
[1:07:09.960 --> 1:07:15.800]  not human they're racist go after them this is their plan and again antifa is just the cover or
[1:07:15.800 --> 1:07:20.360]  the detonator so you've got an 18 page report you've got links to all the statements it's incredible
[1:07:21.160 --> 1:07:24.840]  we know what they're going to pull we can stop them together by getting this report
[1:07:24.840 --> 1:07:29.800]  out listeners to natural news.com and news wars.com i've had it reposted the front page
[1:07:29.800 --> 1:07:35.320]  of info wars.com now lay it out mike all right the first thing to realize is that the mainstream
[1:07:35.320 --> 1:07:42.280]  media operates with emotional currency so emotional currency just like the federal reserve prince fake
[1:07:42.280 --> 1:07:48.840]  fiat currency the mainstream media creates emotional currency that is outrage hatred
[1:07:48.840 --> 1:07:55.880]  and so on cnn is a hate network they are basically a hate spewing factory they produce hate and they
[1:07:55.880 --> 1:08:01.240]  produce outrage and they produce sometimes pity you know when they're showing pictures of children
[1:08:01.240 --> 1:08:05.480]  who have supposedly been bombed in other countries even when those photos are faked
[1:08:05.480 --> 1:08:10.520]  it creates the emotional currency now this emotional currency is then spent by the political
[1:08:10.520 --> 1:08:16.680]  establishment to create the political outcomes that they want to try to get trump out of office
[1:08:16.680 --> 1:08:22.280]  for example or to attack conservatives or attack christians or attack gun owners so emotional currency
[1:08:22.280 --> 1:08:29.480]  is created through mass shootings where there are real people who are shot and killed anytime the
[1:08:29.480 --> 1:08:35.160]  media can show actual bloodshed on camera remember if it bleeds it leads that's their motto then they
[1:08:35.160 --> 1:08:40.840]  are creating they're actually printing emotional currency that they can spend to push for new
[1:08:40.840 --> 1:08:47.160]  restrictions red flag gun confiscation laws for example or even an attempt to ban the second
[1:08:47.160 --> 1:08:52.680]  amendment now when it comes to getting trump out of office which is the all-important goal
[1:08:52.680 --> 1:08:59.720]  of the globalist right now they have to eliminate trump before bar and durham and trump himself
[1:08:59.720 --> 1:09:06.040]  expose the total crimes and corruption the the bribery the kickbacks like to joe biden's son and
[1:09:06.040 --> 1:09:12.520]  so on if if trump isn't removed then all of that's going to be exposed and it's going to be devastating
[1:09:12.520 --> 1:09:18.360]  to the dnc the clinton foundation barack obama himself and all the deep state operatives who took
[1:09:18.360 --> 1:09:25.400]  part in the illegal unconstitutional coup attempt against president trump so the emotional currency
[1:09:25.400 --> 1:09:31.960]  getting back to that has to be created and then directed as a weapon it's kind of like a it's a
[1:09:31.960 --> 1:09:38.920]  psychological weapon system it really is a psyop but they have to spark a major event in order to
[1:09:38.920 --> 1:09:45.560]  create this emotional currency now emotions bypass logic and reason so you notice how if you try to
[1:09:45.560 --> 1:09:52.040]  reason with a liberal that never works a milley weaver from info wars had some excellent videos
[1:09:52.040 --> 1:09:57.880]  that played i think yesterday on the sunday show about how she was talking to a progressive and
[1:09:57.880 --> 1:10:02.120]  saying hey it doesn't two plus two equal four and the progressive said no depends on what your
[1:10:02.120 --> 1:10:09.160]  definition of two is right so logic and reason are no longer there emotions bypass that neurological
[1:10:09.160 --> 1:10:14.840]  circuitry and this is well known by the globalists which is why they evoke emotion in order to bypass
[1:10:14.840 --> 1:10:20.440]  logic you know logically trump was elected by the people trump won the electoral college vote
[1:10:20.440 --> 1:10:26.760]  trump is a legitimate president and he is actually doing the work that his supporters and the voters
[1:10:26.760 --> 1:10:33.080]  want him to do and yet irrationally from an irrational point of view trump has to be removed
[1:10:33.080 --> 1:10:37.880]  because they say orange man bad and they don't like him they don't like his demeanor and so on
[1:10:37.880 --> 1:10:43.560]  so how do you do that that's what this report has focused on it is published at info wars.com how do
[1:10:43.560 --> 1:10:50.360]  you spark massive outrage and generate emotional currency to be directed against trump's supporters
[1:10:50.360 --> 1:10:55.560]  as a weapon here's the answer this is how the globalists do it this is their blueprint they
[1:10:55.560 --> 1:11:02.120]  take everything they want to demonize and they wrap it up into a scenario theater to be played out
[1:11:02.760 --> 1:11:09.160]  along with real casualties real violence real bloodshed that can be caught on camera so what
[1:11:09.160 --> 1:11:16.360]  do they want to demonize they want to demonize patriots trump supporters ar-15s homemade guns
[1:11:16.360 --> 1:11:22.440]  you know 80 percent lowers that are turned into ar-15s or 3d printed guns they want to demonize
[1:11:22.440 --> 1:11:27.080]  white men they want to demonize nationalism or just let's say pride in your own country
[1:11:27.080 --> 1:11:31.000]  they want to demonize the american flag and so on and so forth they want to demonize free speech
[1:11:31.000 --> 1:11:35.720]  online because they don't want conservatives to be allowed to have that speech so how could you
[1:11:35.720 --> 1:11:43.160]  create a scenario imagine if you were a playwright and you were writing a script what scenario could
[1:11:43.160 --> 1:11:49.560]  you write that would encompass all of these different elements and demonize all of them at
[1:11:49.560 --> 1:11:56.120]  the same time with emotional currency to provide a powerful narrative to the mainstream media how
[1:11:56.120 --> 1:12:02.120]  would you do that well we know the answer and this answer is what's described in that story i'll
[1:12:02.120 --> 1:12:08.120]  cover it here in a second this is the playbook this is the blueprint of how the globalists have
[1:12:08.120 --> 1:12:13.800]  run these operations forever i mean in america's history i should say they've been running these
[1:12:13.800 --> 1:12:17.960]  false flags especially since the end of world war two and mike i want you to get into this right
[1:12:17.960 --> 1:12:22.040]  now and it's in your article step by step for the citizens for law enforcement this is a maximum
[1:12:22.040 --> 1:12:26.200]  action item to get this out stop it or they try to pull it we can catch them with their pants
[1:12:26.200 --> 1:12:32.120]  down in the middle of it they prep so when it happens they go see we told you so they say trump's
[1:12:32.120 --> 1:12:37.640]  going to cause violence against the media trump's causing mass shootings and then when they're
[1:12:37.640 --> 1:12:42.600]  provocateurs of their minions or just their spiritual fellow travelers go out and do it they
[1:12:42.600 --> 1:12:47.400]  cover up and say it's a trump supporter and push it with maximum effect they've already been doing it
[1:12:47.400 --> 1:12:52.920]  they're just clearly gearing up to do it on a larger scale and so this is what they've just
[1:12:52.920 --> 1:12:58.040]  like charlottesville where they finance the right wing and they finance the leftist they collide them
[1:12:58.040 --> 1:13:03.240]  a poor woman gets killed uh we point out soros funded at the police stood down they spend it and say
[1:13:03.240 --> 1:13:07.720]  that we say they killed the woman themselves no they created the atmosphere that allowed it to
[1:13:07.720 --> 1:13:12.920]  happen and they sued me to try to stop us from questioning that narrative ahead of more of these
[1:13:12.920 --> 1:13:18.840]  conflagrations that they're trying to create so please continue well they they have to recruit
[1:13:18.840 --> 1:13:23.800]  a scapegoat or two in order to pull this off so the scapegoat will be recruited and this is
[1:13:23.800 --> 1:13:29.240]  harry oswald part two tim mcvay part two exactly the scapegoat will usually be a veteran it'll
[1:13:29.240 --> 1:13:35.400]  be a trump supporter of a firearms owner and the scapegoat will be told a lie uh such as hey the
[1:13:35.400 --> 1:13:40.360]  president wants you to join a secret protection team and we are going to protect the president
[1:13:40.360 --> 1:13:45.240]  during this rally you can't tell anybody wink wink you're going to be part of a team and we're not
[1:13:45.240 --> 1:13:49.880]  attacking everybody in cube because a lot of people think it's good it's perfect to set you up
[1:13:49.880 --> 1:13:55.960]  it's made for it uh yeah yeah exactly this is how the setup happens so then the the fbi usually
[1:13:55.960 --> 1:14:00.200]  that you know again they run many many terror plots all across the country and then they arrest
[1:14:00.200 --> 1:14:06.280]  people at the last minute this is how the fbi uh uh you know operates this is how they quote stop
[1:14:06.280 --> 1:14:10.040]  terrorism and you know the new york times covered that i quoted that in the story but they'll take
[1:14:10.040 --> 1:14:15.960]  these scapegoats and they'll load them up on a bus with other operatives who are part of this stage
[1:14:15.960 --> 1:14:21.640]  team they'll all be dressed up in american flags ballistic vests you know veteran type of patches
[1:14:21.640 --> 1:14:26.600]  on their on their outfits and so on they'll all have ar-15s and so on and then at the appropriate
[1:14:26.600 --> 1:14:33.160]  time this group will be unleashed and the scapegoats won't know what's happening but the operatives
[1:14:33.160 --> 1:14:38.360]  who are part of this will open fire on an innocent crowd perhaps antifa protesters
[1:14:38.360 --> 1:14:44.600]  perhaps leftist protesters who knows they're gonna open fire on an innocent crowd cnn's cameras
[1:14:44.600 --> 1:14:50.360]  will just happen to be there to catch all of this on camera the scapegoats will be arrested or shot
[1:14:50.360 --> 1:14:55.960]  on site so either killed or arrested and then the narrative rolls out everybody else will will
[1:14:55.960 --> 1:15:02.360]  escape and leave the scene and it'll be the scapegoat with a homemade ar-15 with a trump
[1:15:02.360 --> 1:15:08.440]  bumper sticker and an info wars history in his browser that will be the narrative and from that
[1:15:08.440 --> 1:15:12.840]  point on they will use all that powerful emotional currency the dead children the blood the gore the
[1:15:12.840 --> 1:15:17.880]  guts spilling out all over the streets they will say this is trump's fault this is alex jones fault
[1:15:17.880 --> 1:15:24.280]  and see trump is violent trump supporters are violent and they'll call for a total revolution
[1:15:24.280 --> 1:15:30.760]  antifa will be sparked it will explode across every street every city in america mass violence
[1:15:30.760 --> 1:15:35.320]  unrest arson the leftist will bomb government buildings that's how they're going to spark
[1:15:35.320 --> 1:15:40.040]  it the most likely scenario we could stop it and we should discuss that in the next segment how
[1:15:40.040 --> 1:15:44.680]  that's right and antifa run by soros is admitting that's the plan luckily the brother of one of

[1:18:03.320 --> 1:18:10.920]  my phone has been ringing off the hook constitutional lawyers national talk show
[1:18:10.920 --> 1:18:15.800]  host prominent guests i've had on over the years and they're all saying alex it's incredible
[1:18:15.800 --> 1:18:20.840]  you've been obsessing on china since you got on air 20 something years ago and and now it's all
[1:18:20.840 --> 1:18:25.400]  coming through how does you know it because the council on farm relations is the shadow government
[1:18:25.400 --> 1:18:31.800]  and they admitted the plan to transfer all power to communist china and almost everyone calling
[1:18:31.800 --> 1:18:37.000]  me says yeah and they banned you because you were saying all that and how silicon valley
[1:18:37.000 --> 1:18:41.320]  google and apple moved over there and it's incredible and wow you're vindicated you're
[1:18:41.320 --> 1:18:46.840]  going to get back on the air now aren't you and no uh if we don't defeat this takeover you're all
[1:18:46.840 --> 1:18:50.760]  going to be taken off in fact you're all going to end up getting put in prison camps they're making
[1:18:50.760 --> 1:18:55.320]  their move they're coming for your guns they're coming for your kids they're coming for your
[1:18:55.320 --> 1:19:01.080]  right to religion they are coming for your soul well you know what they say you got to lower your
[1:19:01.080 --> 1:19:08.120]  ideals of freedom if you want to suck on the warm teat of china globalism was doomed to fail if we
[1:19:08.120 --> 1:19:14.440]  just exposed it and then resisted it didn't i say a thousand times that there's no way you're
[1:19:14.440 --> 1:19:18.040]  going to have an authoritarian corporate world government above the law that doesn't pay taxes
[1:19:18.040 --> 1:19:22.840]  that has diplomatic immunity that runs around saying it's communist and socialist power to the
[1:19:22.840 --> 1:19:28.280]  people but then meanwhile his tax exempt again offshore well trump got that and all these other
[1:19:28.280 --> 1:19:33.480]  populace get it why would you throw away wealthy successful countries and cultures just so you
[1:19:33.480 --> 1:19:38.520]  could say the communist chinese that david rockefeller put in power are better than everybody
[1:19:38.520 --> 1:19:45.080]  that is a sick freakish joke and i will not stand by and watch humanity turn over to these people
[1:19:45.080 --> 1:19:50.920]  and i beg god for the strength and the will to have the discernment to help be part of their
[1:19:50.920 --> 1:19:56.840]  defeat and i've been saying that prayer for 20 plus years and god is delivering because god is great
[1:19:56.840 --> 1:20:02.200]  thank god for his son jesus christ and now let's move forward against the nw
[1:20:08.040 --> 1:20:10.680]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:20:10.680 --> 1:20:28.760]  welcome back on alex jones your host okay mike adams engineer researcher
[1:20:29.480 --> 1:20:34.680]  um he owns over 300 major websites one of his natural news dot com he's here he's put together
[1:20:34.680 --> 1:20:38.440]  the blueprint with their secret documents their public statements their admissions
[1:20:38.440 --> 1:20:44.040]  and then and then pj media today has an article out where they have an app saying where people live
[1:20:44.040 --> 1:20:50.600]  to go after them but they're just the cover to then go out and pay homeless and others to be
[1:20:50.600 --> 1:20:55.240]  agitators to go out and engage in violence and now you're seeing antifa numbers swell all over
[1:20:55.240 --> 1:21:00.600]  the country where it's not the kind of method you know low level and then professors above them and
[1:21:00.600 --> 1:21:07.800]  then managers from big foundations above that it's now even street rabble under them who really
[1:21:07.800 --> 1:21:12.440]  believe you're nazis and when i would explain to these antifa people i'm not a nazi they will go
[1:21:12.440 --> 1:21:18.760]  really you're not a nazi and they would really get freaked out and walk away uh so but very low
[1:21:18.760 --> 1:21:25.160]  iq folks so so so mike adams clearly they're going into this posture they've said they want the trial
[1:21:26.440 --> 1:21:32.200]  after trump is indicted in the house by thanksgiving they want him gone by christmas that's openly been
[1:21:32.200 --> 1:21:36.760]  announced uh the deep state's pushing for it doesn't matter there's no proof or nothing trump's done
[1:21:36.760 --> 1:21:42.360]  the the system is pushing harder than ever has in three years to remove him they wanted to get rid
[1:21:42.360 --> 1:21:47.080]  of him but now they know they really can't co-opt him because he's talking about our real enemies
[1:21:47.720 --> 1:21:53.960]  that is socialism communism and globalism and they just don't know what to do as he wins this trade
[1:21:53.960 --> 1:21:59.400]  war against china so how do you see them laying this out and how do we stop it well let's talk
[1:21:59.400 --> 1:22:05.080]  about the the theatrical elements first because that that leads us to how we stop it to answer your
[1:22:05.080 --> 1:22:10.520]  question uh let's go back to remember the a and e show it was a couple years ago where they were
[1:22:10.520 --> 1:22:16.120]  trying to film a show about nazis and skinheads and white supremacists in america and they couldn't
[1:22:16.120 --> 1:22:22.760]  find any so the a and e network had to provide the props and the slogans and the script to pay
[1:22:22.760 --> 1:22:27.880]  people extra money to read lines on camera where they were spouting like the n word and all these
[1:22:27.880 --> 1:22:33.560]  racist slogans and stuff but the the network provided the props the swastikas and so on
[1:22:33.560 --> 1:22:39.880]  uh that's just a small example now the stage is the entire country america is a stage for
[1:22:39.880 --> 1:22:45.400]  the globalists in fact much of american history that you think you know has been faked or stage
[1:22:45.400 --> 1:22:51.000]  i should say real events uh wrapped up in false narratives and engineered in order to achieve
[1:22:51.000 --> 1:22:57.000]  specific out of the stage the talking point that comes out of it and they're branding america and
[1:22:57.000 --> 1:23:02.520]  free market and family and christianity as nazi they literally believe they're gonna win this war
[1:23:02.520 --> 1:23:09.000]  against nazis they projected on us it's cold-blooded they know the plan that's exactly right so so the
[1:23:09.000 --> 1:23:15.800]  first thing is to to anyone who is a patriot who is a trump supporter uh don't ever think that you
[1:23:15.800 --> 1:23:20.920]  are being recruited for some secret mission to protect the president with your ar-15 you are
[1:23:20.920 --> 1:23:29.560]  being duped you're being made a scapegoat okay so 100 percent 100 percent uh support your local
[1:23:29.560 --> 1:23:33.960]  law enforcement if they are constitutional support your local sheriffs and deputies most of whom are
[1:23:33.960 --> 1:23:39.000]  constitutional especially in rural america and if anybody's trying to recruit you secretly videotape
[1:23:39.000 --> 1:23:44.200]  them and then just release it raw and call the police local police yeah exactly don't don't think
[1:23:44.200 --> 1:23:48.920]  that you are because the FBI doesn't run this now trump's taken a lot of it over that was left
[1:23:48.920 --> 1:23:54.680]  this unit's doing it before now it's foundations uh it's uh it's southern poverty law center ran
[1:23:54.680 --> 1:23:59.080]  elaheem city and oklahoma city that of course has come out in federal documents so it's going to be a
[1:23:59.080 --> 1:24:04.680]  leftist group they're very dangerous if they know you know they will kill you so you need to understand
[1:24:04.680 --> 1:24:09.480]  these are very dangerous people keep keep going absolutely this this is a really good scenario
[1:24:09.480 --> 1:24:15.640]  to say uh no no thanks i'm not going to be part of this and just be be conscious of how you would
[1:24:15.640 --> 1:24:23.240]  be viewed by a cnn camera run your life every day as if a cnn camera let's say is watching you
[1:24:23.240 --> 1:24:28.840]  as you're out in public what are you doing with a rifle at a trump rally it doesn't really make
[1:24:28.840 --> 1:24:33.080]  any sense trump doesn't need you to protect him with your rifle trump's got secret service trump's
[1:24:33.080 --> 1:24:38.600]  got you know uh undercover playing close people everywhere he doesn't need you to be there uh
[1:24:38.600 --> 1:24:42.680]  with your rifle i mean he needs you to be there as a supporter but not not with a firearm okay so
[1:24:43.560 --> 1:24:49.320]  that's one thing now concealed carry is a different thing i conceal carry everywhere in texas and i
[1:24:49.320 --> 1:24:54.920]  encourage people to lawfully and legally uh carry concealed wherever you can i don't know if that's
[1:24:54.920 --> 1:25:00.440]  allowed in trump rallies or not but just follow the law okay secondly i would say it's not advisable
[1:25:00.440 --> 1:25:06.520]  because they somebody can know your arm sets you up and blame you yeah well again but they want to
[1:25:06.520 --> 1:25:13.240]  demonize the rifles the ar-15s and probably i mean i agree with you exactly it's one thing to open
[1:25:13.240 --> 1:25:17.800]  carry somewhere to show you have that right we totally agree with it we're saying for optics
[1:25:17.800 --> 1:25:23.960]  don't do it around any antifa because they'll see you as a prime target and then once the crowd gets
[1:25:23.960 --> 1:25:29.000]  around you they will sniper some of the antifa and then they will warm it on you and they're trying
[1:25:29.000 --> 1:25:33.560]  to provoke you they're trying to cause a shooting for sure that's why they're using pepper spray and
[1:25:33.560 --> 1:25:39.560]  baseball bats and bike locks they want look the globalists who run antifa they want to sacrifice
[1:25:39.560 --> 1:25:47.800]  antifa soldiers so to speak in bloodshed so they can blame patriots so always walk away if you can
[1:25:47.800 --> 1:25:54.360]  run away if you have to you know just don't open fire this is too important i know you're busy
[1:25:54.360 --> 1:25:57.640]  running your big engineering deal and you're publishing company all your sites and you've

[1:26:31.960 --> 1:26:37.640]  don't want to leave telling people run away from from i mean if there's a civil war then yeah you
[1:26:37.640 --> 1:26:41.800]  got to defend your nation you got to defend the republic don't get tricked into the shot heard
[1:26:41.800 --> 1:26:48.280]  around the world early that's right whoever fires first loses the narrative this is what's key to
[1:26:48.280 --> 1:26:54.200]  understand and firearms owners are very polite they are law-abiding they are upstanding citizens
[1:26:54.200 --> 1:27:00.280]  they are civil society members and that's been great antifa has not been able to get and and
[1:27:00.280 --> 1:27:04.760]  let me add this if you're in antifa you're one of these leptis professor types that knows this is
[1:27:04.760 --> 1:27:11.000]  wrong it's not too late to leak us the info or veritas the info but show tips at info wars dot
[1:27:11.000 --> 1:27:16.360]  com or action and info wars dot com it's not too late also if you're the husband or wife or the
[1:27:16.360 --> 1:27:21.320]  mother or father of one of these antifa people if your son is in college he comes back and visits
[1:27:21.320 --> 1:27:26.840]  you he's out using methamphetamine or whatever get into his bag get into his phone get us the
[1:27:26.840 --> 1:27:33.720]  information but please with with this is a time for for people to do domestic intelligence operations
[1:27:33.720 --> 1:27:38.120]  just everywhere people need to go join antifa groups we need citizens to infiltrate them we
[1:27:38.120 --> 1:27:44.120]  can't do it all what else can do well and and understand our our philosophy i believe it is that
[1:27:44.120 --> 1:27:49.400]  we don't initiate violence but we are prepared to stop it and that's the correct attitude
[1:27:49.400 --> 1:27:54.280]  we don't initiate violence but we're prepared to stop it using legal and lawful means and that
[1:27:54.280 --> 1:27:58.520]  that means of course if you have to back out of a situation where you're being attacked
[1:27:58.520 --> 1:28:05.000]  then do so there's no harm in stepping back or or you could go out there just with with
[1:28:05.000 --> 1:28:09.160]  fists if you if you're going to brawl in the streets just you know just have fists like the
[1:28:09.160 --> 1:28:13.560]  proud boys did you know they're not using they are 15s they're just using the guns on the on
[1:28:13.560 --> 1:28:17.160]  the point is the left's going to try to push us into a civil war they're going to stage events
[1:28:17.160 --> 1:28:21.000]  against themselves and all of that is important operational if things are happening on the ground
[1:28:21.560 --> 1:28:27.240]  i'm saying if you're listening in in college particularly they won't suspect you infiltrate
[1:28:27.240 --> 1:28:32.040]  them get us the data now this next six months two years the most critical time ever these are

[1:28:41.320 --> 1:28:46.280]  you want to yourself knowing you're not an agent of the globalist you go infiltrate get us the data

[1:31:59.800 --> 1:32:05.560]  backing down and we're not going to sell america out to the chicanes one of the most frequently
[1:32:05.560 --> 1:32:10.920]  asked questions we get in customer services what is the real red pill and what is the real red pill
[1:32:10.920 --> 1:32:18.360]  plus well real red pill is a vitamin mineral multivitamin high quality with preglinone real red
[1:32:18.360 --> 1:32:24.760]  pill plus is the same thing with a little bit of clean added energy on top of it as well that kicks
[1:32:24.760 --> 1:32:31.480]  in in 30 minutes but the preglinone kicks in in about a week or so folks look into preglinone for
[1:32:31.480 --> 1:32:36.920]  yourself look in the high end sources of it like real red pill and real red pill plus and then you'll

[1:32:41.880 --> 1:32:47.480]  generally but believe me it's a missing link you need to find out about it as we age preglinone
[1:32:47.480 --> 1:32:52.600]  levels go down all of our hormones in our body are manufactured by the body using preglinone
[1:32:52.600 --> 1:32:58.440]  you need to learn about preglinone and then you need to get the real red pill or the real red pill

[1:33:25.480 --> 1:33:40.840]  from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones
[1:33:55.880 --> 1:33:58.840]  you
[1:34:07.400 --> 1:34:12.280]  ladies and gentlemen we are back live and kerry porch is a real whistleblower
[1:34:12.280 --> 1:34:18.120]  who outed cnn and its leader zeff zucker for its non-stop bias and corrupt reporting of news
[1:34:18.680 --> 1:34:25.320]  in the us now hundreds and hundreds of hours were recorded by him and project veritas got a lot of
[1:34:25.320 --> 1:34:28.760]  attention last week when it released the first few videos and the others are still getting a lot
[1:34:28.760 --> 1:34:33.480]  of attention but they're having to process all of these okay and then it takes filmmakers that
[1:34:33.480 --> 1:34:37.400]  have 100 hours of footage years to make a film will imagine hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of
[1:34:37.400 --> 1:34:44.040]  hours that they're going over their vetting they're then putting you know graphics on and releasing
[1:34:44.040 --> 1:34:49.480]  so a lot of incredible video and reports have been released so far jeff zucker admitting he's
[1:34:49.480 --> 1:34:55.160]  biased at just once trump out of office jeff zucker saying you know we don't want to cover when blacks
[1:34:55.160 --> 1:35:00.120]  get shot in democrat areas we only want to cover when it happens in conservative areas
[1:35:00.760 --> 1:35:08.760]  just so much a trump uh people wishing for his death there are so many of these so i want to
[1:35:08.760 --> 1:35:15.640]  ask kerry porch when we go to him in a moment why he did this because yeah we've seen james
[1:35:15.640 --> 1:35:20.680]  okay talk about the fact that he said he well he did it um you know for this republic so i want
[1:35:20.680 --> 1:35:26.840]  to give mr porch a chance to really just speak about why he went public and what else is going
[1:35:26.840 --> 1:35:31.640]  to be coming out from those hundreds and hundreds of hours of footage and what the response to the
[1:35:31.640 --> 1:35:36.680]  grapevine has been from cnn but to introduce you to kerry porch here's a little two minute
[1:35:36.680 --> 1:35:53.960]  boil down from project veritas my name is kerry porch i'm a satellite uplink technician
[1:35:53.960 --> 1:36:06.760]  i'm a contractor at the cnn washington dc bureau but jeff zucker yeah basically president of cnn
[1:36:06.760 --> 1:36:12.840]  has a personal vendetta against trump it's not gonna be positive for trump he hates it he's gonna
[1:36:12.840 --> 1:36:27.880]  be negative i decided to wear a hidden camera i decided to secretly record the nine a.m. rundown
[1:36:27.880 --> 1:36:47.720]  call meetings and it's basically run by jeff sucker the president of cnn when i came to work
[1:36:47.720 --> 1:37:00.920]  at cnn i mean it was my dream job and that dream actually just turned into a nightmare
[1:37:00.920 --> 1:37:09.640]  well i think what's going on in america now is really fundamentally uh the result of years uh
[1:37:09.640 --> 1:37:18.840]  of fake news conspiracy nonsense fake about fox news he was calling fox news fake news and a
[1:37:18.840 --> 1:37:23.480]  propaganda machine and with what i saw i'm like that's pretty much what cnn was like he's just
[1:37:23.480 --> 1:37:48.440]  pumping out propaganda uh i just wanted to own where they're at like hey if we if we lean left
[1:37:48.440 --> 1:37:54.920]  cool let's just say we lean left if we lean right let it be known but again it just dovetails back
[1:37:54.920 --> 1:38:00.040]  in that thing i just want people to have the information to make up their own minds all right
[1:38:00.040 --> 1:38:06.600]  joining us for the next 50 minutes or so is kerry porch who lost his job at cnn to be able to bring
[1:38:06.600 --> 1:38:11.000]  us forward he didn't come from project veritas he reached out to project veritas this is the real
[1:38:11.000 --> 1:38:16.840]  achilles heel of these corrupt organizations as people going public so we've already seen just
[1:38:16.840 --> 1:38:20.680]  so many it's going it's like 40 something 50 something videos that have come out i can't
[1:38:20.680 --> 1:38:25.320]  even keep track of it all they're all unbelievable uh and so i want to talk about what he did there
[1:38:25.320 --> 1:38:30.760]  why he went public what the response has been what else he sees uh coming out and then since he went
[1:38:30.760 --> 1:38:39.240]  public we see abc news with the fake footage of knob creek saying it's over in syria and
[1:38:39.240 --> 1:38:43.480]  earthquake victim photos from 92 saying it's trumps fault in the new york times i mean
[1:38:43.480 --> 1:38:49.320]  it it's it's like they got caught lying a lot and so now they just lie more as if it's gonna work
[1:38:49.320 --> 1:38:53.960]  and i don't know where this is all going but kerry porch thank you for your courage from for myself
[1:38:53.960 --> 1:38:58.040]  and my family's future for the republic and for the world and and thank you for coming on with us
[1:38:59.320 --> 1:39:04.360]  alex it's a pleasure to be here thank you for having me and um yeah it's a pretty wild ride
[1:39:04.360 --> 1:39:09.880]  this last week has been i'm sure you can understand um the to your question is why i did it is just uh
[1:39:09.880 --> 1:39:14.360]  uh you know i've always been a secret truth one way the other you know ideologies don't really
[1:39:14.360 --> 1:39:18.040]  matter i just wanted the truth to be out there and people to be able to make up their minds
[1:39:18.040 --> 1:39:24.040]  whichever way they lean that's fine um but just the stuff i saw over you know pretty much almost
[1:39:24.040 --> 1:39:28.600]  immediately when i started working there it just it led me down a path to like this is not right
[1:39:28.600 --> 1:39:33.480]  and something's got to be done either as you saw the tapes we just want them to either
[1:39:33.480 --> 1:39:39.080]  own where they're at or you know go back to being like you know the cnn of old the 90s and 2000s
[1:39:39.080 --> 1:39:45.000]  the the bastion of journalism is why we wanted to do it well you talk about how they need to just
[1:39:45.000 --> 1:39:50.200]  say we're journalists or we have a political uh perspective like donald brazil giving them the
[1:39:50.200 --> 1:39:57.800]  debate questions hillary's campaign head it's beyond just not admitting they're political and and have
[1:39:57.800 --> 1:40:04.680]  a slant they are constantly caught putting out fake news and just info i've experienced it myself
[1:40:04.680 --> 1:40:09.640]  they call me the king of fake news and they put out news articles that are just completely fake
[1:40:09.640 --> 1:40:15.240]  they say on cnn uh that i wrote a book called nobody died at sandy hook and lost a lawsuit
[1:40:15.240 --> 1:40:19.160]  i've never read the book i'm not in the book i didn't lose a lawsuit so the level of lies is
[1:40:19.160 --> 1:40:25.400]  just really scary yeah and i can only imagine what you and your family went through i mean
[1:40:26.280 --> 1:40:29.880]  thankfully most of the messages over the last week have been incredibly positive and we're
[1:40:29.880 --> 1:40:34.680]  thankful for that of course we get the nice little uh negative nugget here and there but i guess that
[1:40:34.680 --> 1:40:39.000]  just comes with the territory when you want to do something and you know blow the whistle so to speak
[1:40:39.000 --> 1:40:45.320]  um but yeah it's it's it's just crazy what i saw there it's um you know probably about three
[1:40:45.320 --> 1:40:49.160]  or four months in or even sooner like i started hearing those rundown calls that you played at
[1:40:49.160 --> 1:40:53.400]  the start at the top you know i didn't quite know what it was when i first started but that's
[1:40:53.400 --> 1:40:58.280]  where i started really hearing some things about hey we want to make this you know spin it this way
[1:40:58.280 --> 1:41:02.120]  it kind of fits this narrative or that way or that narrative i'm like but we're supposed to be
[1:41:02.680 --> 1:41:06.600]  middle of the road most trusted name and news like why why do we kind of have our finger on
[1:41:06.600 --> 1:41:11.720]  the scale so like all those little tidbits or what kind of started leading me down this path of
[1:41:11.720 --> 1:41:16.120]  you know transforming from a from a dream career you know because i came here as a registered
[1:41:16.120 --> 1:41:21.880]  democrat to a nightmare of having to lose sleep over what i'm seeing and what i can do if anything
[1:41:22.520 --> 1:41:27.800]  and just traveling down that path so it's been a crazy um last several months because i was there
[1:41:27.800 --> 1:41:32.440]  for almost three years about two and a half and this whole thing didn't even start until like the
[1:41:32.440 --> 1:41:38.600]  last six to eight months roughly well there's so many angles to this president trump also
[1:41:39.480 --> 1:41:44.440]  filed suit on cnn as you know i'm sure friday saying that they're engaged in false advertising
[1:41:44.440 --> 1:41:48.440]  calling themselves the most trusted name of news we're gonna hit every angle of that but when we
[1:41:48.440 --> 1:41:53.880]  come back i want to talk about the process what you did there and then when you decided to start
[1:41:53.880 --> 1:41:59.640]  recording and then what it felt like when you saw it break early last week uh and just that huge
[1:41:59.640 --> 1:42:04.120]  firestorm it's still ongoing and then what the repercussions have been because again you're a
[1:42:04.120 --> 1:42:10.520]  hero what you did was amazing it clearly spurred the president to finally uh take action against
[1:42:10.520 --> 1:42:17.320]  cnn but i and i'm not trying to put the victim here but cnn's oliver darcy and brian stelter
[1:42:17.320 --> 1:42:21.640]  literally terrorized all our sponsors three years ago to go away calling them up saying we're gonna
[1:42:21.640 --> 1:42:26.920]  expose you if you don't drop and then they went after all the big tech firms and worked to get
[1:42:26.920 --> 1:42:32.040]  me thrown off with dis info and so they're not just they're not just engaged in lying they're
[1:42:32.040 --> 1:42:37.480]  also engaged in working to get other people censored and then saying trump's trying to have a war on
[1:42:37.480 --> 1:42:40.920]  the press and shut them down so i want to get your takes on all this but i'm gonna try to just
[1:42:40.920 --> 1:42:44.280]  give you the floor because i've got a thousand thousand points i want to get to and i'm so excited
[1:42:44.280 --> 1:42:50.280]  that uh kerry porch is going to be in studio uh with us on wednesday uh very very excited about
[1:42:50.280 --> 1:42:54.200]  that we'll be right back on the other side and and by the way he's not really pushing this but
[1:42:54.200 --> 1:43:01.080]  i think you should go there folks you should go fund me dot com forward slash expose cnn and support
[1:43:01.080 --> 1:43:11.160]  this guy we'll be right back we are working to share a calm valley to make up ahead of them once
[1:43:11.160 --> 1:43:17.720]  we have full control we send you to re-education camp like we do our people when they talk back to
[1:43:17.720 --> 1:43:27.320]  the party whatever you do do not visit band that video band that video is evil americans
[1:43:27.320 --> 1:43:38.280]  who still come now we are teaching to shut up like china do hey i told you don't go to band
[1:43:38.280 --> 1:43:46.680]  that video i'm watching you haha our system has been adopted worldwide soon we will kill you if
[1:43:46.680 --> 1:43:56.680]  you don't do what we say haha all mark zucker but and others angry at you do what cnn says and
[1:43:56.680 --> 1:44:05.800]  do not visit band that video or i have to hurt you i've got to really hand it to the listeners
[1:44:05.800 --> 1:44:12.440]  and viewers who enforce your support and your help in rebooting americana is a challenge to the
[1:44:12.440 --> 1:44:18.120]  globalist system of corporate tyranny has really caught hold not just here in the u.s. worldwide
[1:44:18.120 --> 1:44:24.680]  and president trump's fearlessness when it comes to promoting americana and basic liberty is amazing
[1:44:24.680 --> 1:44:31.160]  as well he's still lacking on the big tech censorship taking action against that in some other areas but
[1:44:31.160 --> 1:44:35.800]  trying to end the wars boosting our economy speaking out against communist china trump's been
[1:44:35.800 --> 1:44:42.120]  doing an amazing job but now more than ever we really have to realize that we're being targeted
[1:44:42.120 --> 1:44:48.600]  because we are effective and the globalists are beginning to lose their war against humanity in a
[1:44:48.600 --> 1:44:52.920]  big way and so we're going to see some major fireworks out of them but it's critical to not
[1:44:52.920 --> 1:44:58.680]  let ourselves get down when we see all the poison they spray at us that's an attempt to demoralize
[1:44:58.680 --> 1:45:07.160]  us we've got to remember that and stay focused and stay happy communist china quietly bought up
[1:45:07.160 --> 1:45:11.960]  hollywood more than a decade ago and they've been approving almost all the scripts that you see
[1:45:11.960 --> 1:45:18.360]  on television or in the movies for many years and now they own our debt now they own the democratic
[1:45:18.360 --> 1:45:24.440]  party now they've merged silicon valley to censor patriots off the air washington post comes out
[1:45:24.440 --> 1:45:29.400]  and says they hope that gg ping the dictator of china will quote destroy trump that's a headline
[1:45:30.120 --> 1:45:36.680]  so info wars has been the paul revere of this operation we have blown the whistle continuously
[1:45:36.680 --> 1:45:41.240]  and have been proven right and that's why it's more important than ever that we override silicon
[1:45:41.240 --> 1:45:45.720]  valley and their chai kong masters by word of mouth and spread the word about info wars
[1:45:45.720 --> 1:45:51.480]  and check out info war store dot com that's where the arsenal of our republic is being funded that's
[1:45:51.480 --> 1:46:16.920]  where the tip of the spear is continually being forged is infowarstore.com now it's easier than
[1:46:16.920 --> 1:46:23.560]  ever to have band dot video on your iphone simply go to band dot video with your safari browser
[1:46:23.560 --> 1:46:28.840]  then you click the share button at the bottom of the screen when the menu comes up you simply click
[1:46:28.840 --> 1:46:35.560]  add to home screen it will then ask you to name the app i suggest band dot video you will now have
[1:46:35.560 --> 1:46:40.760]  band dot video app on your home screen despite the fact that tim cook tried to stop it the globalists
[1:46:40.760 --> 1:46:45.960]  think you're lazy but by taking a little bit of action you can override them have the app and then
[1:46:45.960 --> 1:46:51.000]  tell others about it so they can get the app so it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech
[1:46:51.000 --> 1:46:56.440]  and click the share buttons below on your email on facebook on twitter on youtube however you want
[1:46:56.440 --> 1:46:58.200]  be sure and share band dot video
[1:46:58.200 --> 1:47:11.000]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:47:28.280 --> 1:47:33.640]  welcome back i'm alex jones your host when you read the wiki links i've read thousands of pages
[1:47:33.640 --> 1:47:38.920]  of them what is hillary clinton and the deep state afraid of their afraid of whistleblowers
[1:47:39.560 --> 1:47:43.400]  now they tell you oh they love whistleblowers these political operatives that have been caught
[1:47:43.400 --> 1:47:48.360]  putting out this info against trump and trumps not persecuted him obama arrested hundreds of
[1:47:48.360 --> 1:47:53.240]  whistleblowers and persecuted the press and went after everybody the media loved that
[1:47:53.240 --> 1:47:59.240]  that now trumps done none of that and they say he's persecuting uh whistleblowers because he speaks
[1:47:59.240 --> 1:48:04.520]  out against what they've said but from what i've seen and maybe i'm wrong i've seen no response
[1:48:05.160 --> 1:48:12.760]  from cnn it's deafening and our guest uh kerry porch was there the morning all this already
[1:48:12.760 --> 1:48:18.200]  dropped and he got that last recording of jeff zucker the ceo so i don't want to be like cnn
[1:48:18.200 --> 1:48:22.760]  telling you what angle and what to cover first but uh can you get into what when you were there
[1:48:22.760 --> 1:48:27.480]  what you did when you started taping why you did it and then what it was like that last morning
[1:48:27.480 --> 1:48:31.640]  and then what the response has been like in the last week and a half since you were last week
[1:48:31.640 --> 1:48:36.840]  since you went public sure of course alex again thank you so much for having me thank you um
[1:48:36.840 --> 1:48:41.560]  it is an honor so like uh i know there's a lot of different you know uh pigeon and rabbit holes we
[1:48:41.560 --> 1:48:47.080]  can go down but the main thing is that again i started in june of 17 um you know i was a former
[1:48:47.080 --> 1:48:53.240]  bernie bro um in 16 so i came there fully entrenched on the left of what we now call the you know um
[1:48:53.240 --> 1:48:57.480]  you know screeching in pc type of thing but um that's where i was politically so i came there
[1:48:57.480 --> 1:49:02.760]  with my dream job and within three to six months as the tapes say just started noticing a lot of
[1:49:02.760 --> 1:49:07.880]  different things that really did not sit well with me like this we're not objective in my opinion
[1:49:07.880 --> 1:49:12.760]  like we were tipping our finger on the scale and it just started leading me down um you know a
[1:49:12.760 --> 1:49:16.840]  different path to kind of researching for my own stuff about what was what we were truly reporting
[1:49:16.840 --> 1:49:22.760]  and how we were presenting it as objectivity you know trusted name and news facts first their newest
[1:49:22.760 --> 1:49:26.840]  slogan and everything like that i mean all in all i'm thinking about there are hundreds and hundreds
[1:49:26.840 --> 1:49:32.360]  of tv's on every floor you can't really escape it there's even live uh live tv in the bathroom like
[1:49:32.360 --> 1:49:37.080]  you literally cannot escape it uh even if you are headphones you know your eyes catch the chiron so
[1:49:37.080 --> 1:49:42.600]  you're always consuming news like eight nine ten hours a day and it just it got to me to a point
[1:49:42.600 --> 1:49:46.920]  where i guess i was starting to lose sleep and coming home and my amazing uh amazing leading
[1:49:46.920 --> 1:49:51.160]  lady in my life you know she was noticing me just having a really rough time not sleeping and
[1:49:51.160 --> 1:49:56.920]  explaining to her what was going on she's been my rock and uh literally i was about to quit and i
[1:49:56.920 --> 1:50:03.320]  had my two weeks notice typed up on my computer and then i uh got assigned to work c-pack in dc
[1:50:04.040 --> 1:50:08.360]  and uh by this time i've already been kind of uh you know for lack of a better term red filling
[1:50:08.360 --> 1:50:14.200]  myself while inside the building the first couple years that i was in the building that makes sense
[1:50:14.200 --> 1:50:17.960]  so i was already like okay there's some cool people that i wanted to see and and meet and
[1:50:17.960 --> 1:50:22.840]  i've always been aware of okif and veritas even when i was on the left and they were taken down
[1:50:22.840 --> 1:50:28.120]  you know my guys and my girls but you can't argue with tape i mean it's there um so i always
[1:50:28.120 --> 1:50:34.040]  respected james but i didn't really like him but respected him if you know what i mean um and again
[1:50:34.040 --> 1:50:39.480]  i was just about to quit and then i saw him speak at like the epic times and hills del booth
[1:50:39.480 --> 1:50:43.400]  and then he got up on stage and that's where they debuted the facebook insider
[1:50:43.960 --> 1:50:49.000]  and it was a great expose a great video and it had that cheesy tagline on the end you know be brave
[1:50:49.000 --> 1:50:55.400]  do something um and you know what is cheesy as it was it spoke to me and uh you know let me interrupt
[1:50:55.400 --> 1:51:00.200]  you because it's cheesy when someone doesn't take action but when you really do it you are the man
[1:51:00.200 --> 1:51:05.960]  in the arena it is brave it is amazing and and and it's what civilization good civilization is
[1:51:05.960 --> 1:51:11.160]  built up buddy so we all admire you please continue awesome thanks alex and uh so you
[1:51:11.160 --> 1:51:15.960]  know my heart was pounding just keep in mind like i'm at a highly conservative uh leaning
[1:51:15.960 --> 1:51:21.080]  events and i have a cnn badge and everybody's looking at me weird like you know i'm the enemy
[1:51:21.080 --> 1:51:25.880]  and and i get that it's you know team sport whatever so i made my way down to the booth
[1:51:25.880 --> 1:51:30.040]  and um you know got to talk to james as he was signing books and like hey i'm you know my name's
[1:51:30.040 --> 1:51:35.400]  carry i work for a uh you know i work for a three-letter news agency and he originally thought i
[1:51:35.400 --> 1:51:39.720]  said like government agency so he thought i was like an fbi or you know spook or something like that
[1:51:40.760 --> 1:51:44.840]  so but we eventually started talking and that was in february or march of this year
[1:51:45.480 --> 1:51:50.600]  and he and i both talked i mean we were feeling each other out for a good month or so month and a
[1:51:50.600 --> 1:51:56.040]  half because we both had a lot to lose if you know one party wasn't in it to win it so to speak and
[1:51:56.760 --> 1:52:00.600]  then just a few more things happened at work and that's when i really decided to
[1:52:00.600 --> 1:52:04.840]  call them up and said hey look are you good because let's let's do this and that was around
[1:52:04.840 --> 1:52:09.560]  the summer like june or july somewhere around there so i have about a good you know five to
[1:52:09.560 --> 1:52:13.880]  six months or whatever of recordings and that's kind of what we that what they all drew from as
[1:52:13.880 --> 1:52:19.320]  you mentioned the um the back end editing bays and just a you know shout out i mean just as i was
[1:52:19.320 --> 1:52:25.240]  motivated by the facebook and other insiders anyone that's in a tech media finance insurance
[1:52:25.240 --> 1:52:31.080]  whatever if you see some malfeasance malfeasance please go to project baritoss.com slash brave
[1:52:31.080 --> 1:52:37.160]  it's got all the tip line pro uh proton mail to get in touch i mean just as i was motivated alex
[1:52:37.160 --> 1:52:41.320]  i'm hoping that other people will come forward because of what i did because i came forward
[1:52:41.320 --> 1:52:46.040]  because of the ones before me you know the facebook and pinterest and google people so that's kind of
[1:52:46.040 --> 1:52:51.080]  where we're at now and um you know a lot of family situations happened in the last several weeks
[1:52:51.080 --> 1:52:55.160]  you know found out i was having a child in the new year so that was just the big motivator to get
[1:52:55.160 --> 1:53:00.280]  it done as fast as i could and to wrap it up and you know you see what we have in the tapes there so
[1:53:01.480 --> 1:53:08.200]  that's kind of a very short story to a long story arc of kind of how we got from earlier than 2019
[1:53:08.200 --> 1:53:13.320]  to where we are you know this past monday and to your other question about the response it's
[1:53:13.320 --> 1:53:18.440]  it's been insane in good and bad ways i mean we knew it was going to be big but we didn't realize how
[1:53:19.240 --> 1:53:24.360]  crazy that the internet would say it's probably the biggest thing that there does ever done and
[1:53:24.360 --> 1:53:29.000]  that's saying a lot yeah they're they're great they're great team and let me just shout out
[1:53:29.000 --> 1:53:34.200]  uh oakheaf and company like everything that that man and his team have said to me uh everything
[1:53:34.200 --> 1:53:38.520]  they've promised me has come true and then some you know it was never about the money i wanted to
[1:53:38.520 --> 1:53:42.440]  do the right thing that was their idea like hey let's set you up a go fund me for like we did
[1:53:42.440 --> 1:53:46.200]  for the previous whistleblowers because you're probably not going to work in media ever again
[1:53:46.200 --> 1:53:51.480]  and let me say while this is important because when they get mccabe to lie about trump and
[1:53:51.480 --> 1:53:55.880]  then he got what was it almost a million bucks last time i checked in his go fund me they celebrate
[1:53:55.880 --> 1:54:01.480]  their people well we need to celebrate whistleblowers especially gigantic ones that you know deliver
[1:54:01.480 --> 1:54:06.280]  the motherload like you've done and who you know lose their job their dream job for doing the right
[1:54:06.280 --> 1:54:11.080]  thing people need to at least uh you know help you so that you end up getting a job and i'm sure
[1:54:11.080 --> 1:54:15.480]  you're gonna end up getting one with veritas or the rnc or you know wherever you want to hell if
[1:54:15.480 --> 1:54:18.920]  we have the money we will probably try to hire you because we're trying to expand they're trying
[1:54:18.920 --> 1:54:24.680]  to shut us down but absolutely people need to go to the go fund me so you've got money to continue
[1:54:24.680 --> 1:54:29.800]  on whether you do as independent journals whatever it is it's that wartime seed money that people
[1:54:29.800 --> 1:54:37.000]  need to get so uh people can go to gofundme.com forward slash expose cnn uh because it's it's
[1:54:37.000 --> 1:54:42.920]  just absolutely vital that people understand that we don't just uh support and say we support
[1:54:42.920 --> 1:54:47.960]  patriots like you but we actually back them absolutely thank you i like to know i'm working
[1:54:47.960 --> 1:54:52.520]  on something else in the meantime like yourself all your listeners the amazing patriots have been
[1:54:52.520 --> 1:54:57.160]  amazing and the go fund me got funded in a couple days i'm in process finding the legal
[1:54:57.160 --> 1:55:01.480]  works to do it right now but i want to take care of the other people that lost their job directly
[1:55:01.480 --> 1:55:06.040]  because of the expose so we're in the works of that right now because i want to get those people
[1:55:06.040 --> 1:55:10.040]  at least made whole or as whole as we can in the short term so i'll definitely stay in touch with
[1:55:10.040 --> 1:55:14.440]  you and hopefully can work to help these guys out that oh i didn't even let you finish we didn't do
[1:55:14.440 --> 1:55:18.760]  any pre-interview notice here there's no pre-interview there's no scripting cnn that you like five of
[1:55:18.760 --> 1:55:22.840]  them believe me i've been on it quite a few times here it's just boom so you're you've already gotten
[1:55:22.840 --> 1:55:26.840]  your go fund you're not even worried you want to help other folks tell us about that then we'll get
[1:55:26.840 --> 1:55:30.760]  into all the new stuff that's about to come out i don't i don't want to you know steal the thunder
[1:55:30.760 --> 1:55:35.160]  from the veritas there's a lot of stuff that's coming out soon that'll actually promote it uh but
[1:55:35.160 --> 1:55:39.400]  uh but so other folks got in trouble because of the whistleblowing well you know what that's
[1:55:39.400 --> 1:55:43.640]  collateral damage but at least you're trying to help them what happened yeah indeed alex and again
[1:55:43.640 --> 1:55:49.000]  i don't have direct confirmation yet but through third parties i've learned that there's uh my last
[1:55:49.000 --> 1:55:54.440]  count and again this is just from what i'm trying to deduce there were about six six to nine people
[1:55:54.440 --> 1:55:59.880]  throughout the three bureaus at lana new york and uh and dc that were directly tied to this contract
[1:55:59.880 --> 1:56:05.480]  that i worked for that uh from what i understand and again haven't confirmed it yet but that lost
[1:56:05.480 --> 1:56:10.360]  their jobs directly because the expose so the patriots you guys were amazing in helping you
[1:56:10.360 --> 1:56:14.840]  know my family and i get some seed money for for the next couple years or whatever but obviously
[1:56:14.840 --> 1:56:19.240]  collateral damage is never intended at all and that's what i'm losing sleep about right now because
[1:56:19.240 --> 1:56:24.200]  listen i know but so many good people never take action because there's never a perfect way you did
[1:56:24.200 --> 1:56:28.600]  what you did you lost your job these people are working in an evil place it's going to be better
[1:56:28.600 --> 1:56:33.160]  for them in the end my god i mean this is an anti-american criminal organization i'm sorry
[1:56:33.160 --> 1:56:39.320]  and i just i don't want you to feel guilty well i appreciate that i mean again i just want to
[1:56:39.320 --> 1:56:43.480]  throw it out there a lot of people are saying that i was a direct scene employee i was a contractor
[1:56:43.480 --> 1:56:48.760]  just like the facebook insider was a contractor um you know i just wait aren't most of them contractors
[1:56:49.720 --> 1:56:54.440]  uh and to my knowledge no most of them are direct cnn or employees i could be wrong but um
[1:56:54.440 --> 1:57:00.120]  most are direct employees but they do their tertiary stuff through contractors like myself yeah
[1:57:00.120 --> 1:57:03.000]  we're gonna go to break i'm gonna come back and i want you to be able to have a fuller
[1:57:03.000 --> 1:57:06.680]  seven to get a subject you want to get into that i want to get into what's coming up next what else
[1:57:06.680 --> 1:57:12.120]  you witnessed that hasn't come out yet and so many other angles here and where you think this
[1:57:12.120 --> 1:57:16.680]  election's going where you think we cnn's i mean did you ever witness when they're like attacking
[1:57:16.680 --> 1:57:22.120]  and supporting big tech censorship oh absolutely i saw it i mean firsthand where they're uh you
[1:57:22.120 --> 1:57:26.600]  know i i noticed that when they kind of scrub you from the internet like in a very concerted
[1:57:26.600 --> 1:57:32.280]  concise like you know singular strike action that to me was that blew me away i'm like you know

[2:00:09.080 --> 2:00:25.000]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[2:00:29.960 --> 2:00:33.880]  i can't wait till this guest is with us in studio on wednesday for a full two hours
[2:00:33.880 --> 2:00:38.120]  and i'm looking at all the other news i've gotten in front of me how does cnn
[2:00:39.000 --> 2:00:45.000]  spend half its time on ukraine or russia and then most the other stuff trying to create a race
[2:00:45.000 --> 2:00:50.600]  war i'm just i'm looking at all this news gender identity politics setting stage for post human
[2:00:50.600 --> 2:00:56.840]  future nick cave slams woke cultures an assault on free speech study reveals how super bugs acquire
[2:00:56.840 --> 2:01:01.880]  drug resistance a message from the front line of the info war this is just what the last few minutes
[2:01:01.880 --> 2:01:07.400]  is chili extends curfew as death toll rises riots and just unrest all of the world right now
[2:01:07.960 --> 2:01:12.760]  julian assange just oriented at court proceeding says i can't talk properly he's being tortured
[2:01:12.760 --> 2:01:16.680]  in solidary confinement one of the big things trump needs to do something about shame on trump
[2:01:16.680 --> 2:01:24.040]  for that carry porch the huge cnn contractor whistleblower is here whether this is a short
[2:01:24.040 --> 2:01:27.880]  segment long segments coming up boy the stuff he's been saying during breaks i'm like please repeat
[2:01:27.880 --> 2:01:34.360]  that when we come back but right now just getting back to the general climate of things uh what would
[2:01:34.360 --> 2:01:42.920]  you call this period we're in in america and and where do you think this is all going i mean so
[2:01:42.920 --> 2:01:47.320]  many ways we could go with that one alexon and again this is just my humble opinion is basically
[2:01:47.320 --> 2:01:53.960]  to try to sew as much pain and discord uh into the american fabric as possible i mean i remember
[2:01:53.960 --> 2:02:00.680]  even even five even five years ago i remember uh you know before the before the 16 election i mean
[2:02:00.680 --> 2:02:05.320]  we could always have discussions with those we disagreed with in a very civil humane manner
[2:02:05.320 --> 2:02:10.680]  and still walk away uh friendships and families intact and and now apparently it's just the
[2:02:10.680 --> 2:02:14.520]  wedge that's been driven either way it's it's just like if you it's all or nothing if you
[2:02:15.080 --> 2:02:20.120]  don't agree with any one part of my beliefs then you're a piece of crap and vice versa it's all
[2:02:20.120 --> 2:02:24.600]  or nothing and it's dividing us further in the teams and tribes and that's kind of what i've
[2:02:24.600 --> 2:02:30.040]  noticed and i mean how do you feel about that well i think you just hit the nail on the proverbial
[2:02:30.040 --> 2:02:35.800]  head and if you read the wedgie leaks thanks to assange it's hillary talking to top professors
[2:02:35.800 --> 2:02:39.880]  of media saying we've got to intensify the culture war that means men against women black
[2:02:39.880 --> 2:02:44.600]  against white and you can just see it you tune into it it's like an alternate universe or you
[2:02:44.600 --> 2:02:49.160]  read the new york times and you'd believe that america was run by nazis not that we kicked their
[2:02:49.160 --> 2:02:55.880]  ass indeed i mean that's the new buzzword for anything i mean anyone i don't agree with uh is
[2:02:55.880 --> 2:03:01.400]  a nazi and go punch nazis and violence is good against anyone even perceived to be a nazi i mean
[2:03:01.400 --> 2:03:06.040]  what was that uh they actually had like a uh a march in at the white house or something several
[2:03:06.040 --> 2:03:10.920]  months ago or it truly was like a you know what if i remember correctly like a kkk march or something
[2:03:10.920 --> 2:03:14.760]  and what there were like 40 people or something like that it wasn't the thousands and thousands
[2:03:14.760 --> 2:03:19.160]  that our people are making out to be right now it's just talk to your neighbor like i think rob
[2:03:19.160 --> 2:03:23.000]  schneider said it best talk to your neighbor you find out we have way more in common and the world
[2:03:23.000 --> 2:03:27.560]  is a lot nicer than what the tv is telling you it is and that's kind of what one of the many things
[2:03:27.560 --> 2:03:32.280]  i saw while working there is just constantly pumping out division topics that's going to force
[2:03:32.280 --> 2:03:37.960]  people into one camp or the other either or not either and and it's just sad to see um you know
[2:03:37.960 --> 2:03:43.000]  so many good friendships and family relationships broken over just some stuff that's not really a
[2:03:43.000 --> 2:03:47.080]  big deal like you can just agree to disagree on several topics but again that's not the cool thing
[2:03:47.080 --> 2:03:51.560]  to do you want to put some rage bait out there and get some clicks it's just i don't like the way
[2:03:51.560 --> 2:03:56.600]  it's going and i'm hoping that you know myself and everyone else that's on the front lines can like
[2:03:56.600 --> 2:04:01.320]  hey let's get back to a time of stability to discuss the differences we have like we did before
[2:04:02.360 --> 2:04:06.360]  you know the elites got their hands on everything you know well that's right then when you learn
[2:04:06.360 --> 2:04:11.800]  that the communist china literally owns and controls six of the big production houses and
[2:04:11.800 --> 2:04:16.760]  is financing the race war stuff and you can read in their major publications they brag oh we're
[2:04:16.760 --> 2:04:22.120]  financing this to divide our enemy america all the netflix shows about race war and all this
[2:04:22.120 --> 2:04:28.200]  and all these movies it's literally chai kong funded to divide our nation it's unbelievable
[2:04:28.200 --> 2:04:32.760]  that we've gotten to this point but luckily now the fact that china's influence is so big is coming
[2:04:32.760 --> 2:04:39.160]  out yeah i mean i i don't know too much about those details i'm loving to look into that stuff
[2:04:39.160 --> 2:04:44.600]  that you're mentioning um it's just i'm noticing from even from leading up to last uh the last
[2:04:44.600 --> 2:04:50.920]  election cycle that there was something different in the american fabric that truly was monumental
[2:04:50.920 --> 2:04:55.720]  a shift and that's what i want us to get back to is to be able to talk to not even those across the
[2:04:55.720 --> 2:05:00.360]  aisle those are the sitting right next to us in the seat on our side exactly stay right there major
[2:05:00.360 --> 2:05:05.000]  senior whistleblower is our guest stay with us i've got to really hand it to the listeners
[2:05:05.000 --> 2:05:11.720]  and viewers who enforce your support and your help in rebooting americana is a challenge to the
[2:05:11.720 --> 2:05:17.320]  globalist system of corporate tyranny has really caught hold not just here in the us worldwide
[2:05:17.320 --> 2:05:23.880]  and president trump's fearlessness when it comes to promoting americana and basic liberty is amazing
[2:05:23.880 --> 2:05:29.960]  as well he's still lacking on the big tech censorship taking action against that in some other areas
[2:05:29.960 --> 2:05:35.080]  but trying to end the wars boosting our economy speaking out against communist china trump's been
[2:05:35.080 --> 2:05:41.400]  doing an amazing job but now more than ever we really have to realize that we're being targeted
[2:05:41.400 --> 2:05:47.720]  because we are effective and the globalists are beginning to lose their war against humanity in
[2:05:47.720 --> 2:05:52.120]  a big way and so we're going to see some major fireworks out of them but it's critical to not
[2:05:52.120 --> 2:05:57.960]  let ourselves get down when we see all the poison they spray at us that's an attempt to demoralize
[2:05:57.960 --> 2:06:01.720]  us we've got to remember that and stay focused and stay happy
[2:06:08.360 --> 2:06:20.280]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[2:06:21.480 --> 2:06:24.200]  well we've got epic music playing in the background
[2:06:24.200 --> 2:06:31.640]  because this is epic we have seen high-level whistleblowers from google apple twitter facebook
[2:06:32.520 --> 2:06:41.960]  and now we see people like kerry porch contracts with cnn since 2017
[2:06:43.640 --> 2:06:49.560]  and running into project veritas at an event he was covering talking to him forming a relationship
[2:06:49.560 --> 2:06:55.320]  over the next six months or so and then deciding to document what he thought was immoral and deceptive
[2:06:55.320 --> 2:06:59.800]  going on undoubtedly it spurred the president to follow this big false advertising suit against
[2:06:59.800 --> 2:07:06.840]  cnn and we're going to look at some of that with kerry here but it gets into the fact that they say
[2:07:06.840 --> 2:07:13.960]  that with the most trusted name in journalism truth seekers fair and truly balanced and then
[2:07:13.960 --> 2:07:20.280]  you have all the internal video showing just the opposite you say that it's been an overwhelming
[2:07:20.280 --> 2:07:30.600]  response uh has the cnn responded in any way not as of yet um and again it's been i'd say 97 98
[2:07:30.600 --> 2:07:35.960]  percent positive i mean the like i should do screenshots or books and just show the amazing
[2:07:35.960 --> 2:07:40.600]  overwhelming response because as you can imagine alex and your listeners and you know leading up to
[2:07:40.600 --> 2:07:44.920]  it it was a roller coaster of emotions like am i doing the right thing of course i'm doing the
[2:07:44.920 --> 2:07:49.240]  right thing now a minute later no i'm doing the wrong thing i'm burning the rest of my career
[2:07:49.240 --> 2:07:55.640]  i mean all these things within minutes were highs and lows it was an insane like emotional roller
[2:07:55.640 --> 2:08:00.440]  coaster but the the messages the hundreds and thousands of messages that have rolled in both
[2:08:00.440 --> 2:08:05.800]  publicly and privately have been overwhelming to say that i've done to convince me and my family
[2:08:05.800 --> 2:08:11.240]  that we've done the right thing and um you know yourself and many others it's truly been overwhelming
[2:08:11.240 --> 2:08:16.440]  i mean the go funding got funded in the day and a half i mean that that blew our minds and it's
[2:08:16.440 --> 2:08:21.080]  obviously very much appreciated but it's one of those things that you know over the several months
[2:08:21.080 --> 2:08:26.120]  of being here seeing what seeing and hearing what i've seen is that i it just led me to want to
[2:08:26.120 --> 2:08:31.000]  protect the republic in in any way that i could and i was positioned at a very unique point in
[2:08:31.000 --> 2:08:36.520]  space and time with an opportunity to just do something about it my goal on that was uh well
[2:08:36.520 --> 2:08:42.200]  james and my goal is one of two things either get cnn and the rest of the media perhaps to just own
[2:08:42.200 --> 2:08:46.760]  where you're at cool just be transparent like hey we're going to get it from a left leaning lens
[2:08:46.760 --> 2:08:52.040]  great at least we know or to just return to the greatness of truly objective journalism as you
[2:08:52.040 --> 2:08:57.000]  saw on the tapes like people like um you know that the field ops uh head of field ops that
[2:08:57.000 --> 2:09:01.960]  patrick davis amazing guy and i mean you can hear his words like he's painful like he's been there
[2:09:01.960 --> 2:09:06.920]  you know 20 30 years and all he wanted to do was to do what he signed up to do do the news
[2:09:06.920 --> 2:09:10.600]  so many people like him in those conversations they're not villains they're just people that
[2:09:10.600 --> 2:09:15.480]  want to do true journalism is that the individual that talks about cnn's done a deal with the devil
[2:09:17.400 --> 2:09:23.640]  no no that was someone else patrick was the um uh the gentleman with with like we were having
[2:09:23.640 --> 2:09:29.000]  a beer and stuff outside of work uh talking about you know trump's doing this but those 500 assholes
[2:09:29.000 --> 2:09:32.760]  on the hill they're the ones that are the true criminals and stuff like that you remember that
[2:09:32.760 --> 2:09:40.360]  one yes that one there's so many uh right in fact that's my next question how many hours you think
[2:09:40.360 --> 2:09:44.280]  you shot i'm told it's hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and what other big bomb shells are coming
[2:09:45.480 --> 2:09:50.440]  i mean i mean think about it you'd have five six whatever months of of truly recording i mean
[2:09:50.440 --> 2:09:55.560]  there's there's gotta be hundreds hundreds and hundreds of hours um i love it i leave it to the
[2:09:55.560 --> 2:10:00.360]  great team over at veritas that the sift through then they found the biggest bomb shells that
[2:10:00.360 --> 2:10:04.520]  that they could um the one that the next one that's coming out pretty soon like
[2:10:04.520 --> 2:10:09.560]  i obviously can't speak to it but it's if it's what i what i think it is it's pretty uh it's
[2:10:09.560 --> 2:10:14.920]  going to be pretty big so um we have not got a response from uh cnn or anyone else obviously
[2:10:14.920 --> 2:10:19.080]  i'm not naive enough to think that they're going to take it laying down and you know my family and
[2:10:19.080 --> 2:10:23.480]  i were just kind of bracing for impact of whatever the next shoe falls may be if that makes sense
[2:10:24.280 --> 2:10:28.520]  well i think they're pretty smart over there they're evil but at the top but they know
[2:10:29.880 --> 2:10:35.000]  the guy like you if they persecute you it's going to make more whistleblowers come out of it i mean
[2:10:35.000 --> 2:10:40.200]  the way human nature works especially americans is you bully people more of the fight back i think
[2:10:40.200 --> 2:10:45.000]  the out of control left's beginning to realize that all their bullying is not making people go away
[2:10:45.000 --> 2:10:49.960]  it's actually making a lot of people start to take action absolutely and that's i mean that's
[2:10:49.960 --> 2:10:54.520]  why i came for it i mean you know we all loved facebook when it started and then slowly but
[2:10:54.520 --> 2:10:59.320]  surely we all kind of see how tech is kind of you know has its hands and everything um but
[2:10:59.320 --> 2:11:02.840]  one thing i'd obviously wanted to make sure of i mean as you see in the tapes i mean
[2:11:03.480 --> 2:11:08.920]  most of the people are good decent talented hardworking diligent people that just want to
[2:11:08.920 --> 2:11:13.000]  do their job and they're frustrated with like you know the orders from on high from the generals
[2:11:13.000 --> 2:11:18.360]  on well even van jones two years ago goes undercover veritas he goes oh that's a nothing burger
[2:11:18.360 --> 2:11:22.520]  there's nothing trumps not involved with russia you know trump won't take money from any special
[2:11:22.520 --> 2:11:27.480]  interest nobody tells him what to do not top generals not coming you think the russians tell
[2:11:27.480 --> 2:11:33.160]  donald trump what to do give me a break well i mean if we if we play the mainstream narrative i mean
[2:11:33.160 --> 2:11:38.520]  that's exactly what's going on everyone's a russian asset or a spy or you know you got a room full
[2:11:38.520 --> 2:11:43.960]  of whatever the report was 20 30 people making you know memes change an election go go figure but
[2:11:45.080 --> 2:11:48.360]  yeah the van jones thing that was that was actually one of my favorite things that kind of
[2:11:48.360 --> 2:11:54.360]  really stuck in me to go seek james out over over to veritas i mean it's just wild to see
[2:11:55.080 --> 2:12:01.000]  how the news goes and again i don't care what people believe left right center libertarian
[2:12:01.000 --> 2:12:05.800]  social i don't care a lot of people and say i don't have a bias but let's go further what about abc
[2:12:05.800 --> 2:12:12.120]  and others putting out fake videos cropped of a machine gun shootout saying it's 5000 foot mushroom
[2:12:12.120 --> 2:12:17.000]  clouds in a city being vaporized look like a godzilla movie or or the new york times you're
[2:12:17.000 --> 2:12:21.880]  putting out a fake photo uh well it was a real photo from 92 of earthquake victims and saying
[2:12:21.880 --> 2:12:26.440]  it's trump i mean this this isn't just seeing in it's like mainstream media is getting worse
[2:12:26.440 --> 2:12:31.880]  i would never do something like that and i'm supposedly the king of fake news i mean that's
[2:12:31.880 --> 2:12:36.760]  what i believed uh for for years i mean alex i was uh you know i consider myself a halfway
[2:12:36.760 --> 2:12:41.000]  intelligent person and i was brainwashing all the stuff to even hating you and other people that
[2:12:41.000 --> 2:12:47.640]  weren't you know authoritative sources as as uh as um youtube ceo says you know understand and
[2:12:47.640 --> 2:12:52.840]  and i'm a recent kind of convert and fan so it's just crazy that anyone of any intellect level can
[2:12:52.840 --> 2:12:59.000]  be kind of led down this amazingly powerful and potent media apparatus when you hear it enough i
[2:12:59.000 --> 2:13:04.840]  mean uh uh hereditary they comparing like trump to the nazis and gobbles and the propaganda but
[2:13:04.840 --> 2:13:09.480]  if you hear something enough i mean you kind of tend to believe it you know it's it's just strange
[2:13:09.480 --> 2:13:14.920]  to see how it works especially from the inside and that actually comes from gerbils tell a big
[2:13:14.920 --> 2:13:21.160]  lie and tell it over and over again and because it's so big people will believe it yeah i mean
[2:13:21.160 --> 2:13:25.800]  that's pretty much what happens i mean you saw with abc thing and everyone that does all these
[2:13:25.800 --> 2:13:29.960]  big stories and gets caught i mean the only reason that they're apologizing is we have people
[2:13:29.960 --> 2:13:33.960]  that are diligent enough to say hey this doesn't quite look right and then they find out what it is
[2:13:33.960 --> 2:13:39.880]  and oh well our bad i mean they're only apologizing because they got caught they're so powerful nowadays
[2:13:39.880 --> 2:13:43.960]  going back to the other point is just i don't care where you lean or where you want just here
[2:13:43.960 --> 2:13:47.880]  here's the facts in a truly objective manner you make up your own mind and we can go grab a beer
[2:13:47.880 --> 2:13:53.320]  afterwards no big deal and well also the minute i saw it i said that's knob creek i had been so
[2:13:53.320 --> 2:13:58.600]  busy i hadn't watched last years but i was i mean usually has like 15 20 million views when they do
[2:13:58.600 --> 2:14:03.800]  that big you know 100 machine guns at once tracer rounds blowing up cans of gasoline the minute i saw
[2:14:03.800 --> 2:14:09.400]  it i said that's knob creek so the arrogance of putting a knob creek video out and thinking we're
[2:14:09.400 --> 2:14:13.800]  so stupid that people wouldn't instantly know what it was now they cropped it and they turned
[2:14:13.800 --> 2:14:18.280]  the light level down to trying to see but people still knew and went and found the exact video
[2:14:18.280 --> 2:14:24.120]  so again that just shows an incredible level of arrogance can you did you see any arrogance uh
[2:14:24.120 --> 2:14:29.000]  not to that level or anything like that i mean i i i was still a relatively low level employee like
[2:14:29.000 --> 2:14:33.560]  you know i obviously wasn't in you know these nine a.m. meetings in person or in the editorial
[2:14:33.560 --> 2:14:38.280]  meetings so i just wanted another one of those uh cut you know cut and paste jobs like what was it
[2:14:38.280 --> 2:14:44.680]  the um the whole syrian um you know a solid thing where you know the chemical weapons and you had a
[2:14:44.680 --> 2:14:49.240]  boots on ground seeing a journalist smelling a backpack with a supposedly deadly gas i mean
[2:14:49.240 --> 2:14:55.160]  that doesn't seem like the smartest thing to do if you have one smell of sarin would kill you i mean
[2:14:55.160 --> 2:14:59.320]  it's like you're smelling a backpack and it's purported like you said immediately deadly i'm
[2:14:59.320 --> 2:15:05.000]  like that's the last thing i would do is smell a poisonous backpack you know and then foreign media
[2:15:05.000 --> 2:15:09.480]  found the kids that are dying on video saying they took us from the school they threw water on us
[2:15:09.480 --> 2:15:14.360]  put green paint on us and then gave us candy afterwards i mean the kids that are falling
[2:15:14.360 --> 2:15:19.400]  down convulsing that they later say died are saying no i had this was staged so then we
[2:15:19.400 --> 2:15:24.440]  have a right to then ask is something staged in the future that's the whole thing i mean regardless
[2:15:24.440 --> 2:15:29.960]  of where people stand just let's give us the mean potatoes give us what is triad i see it on screen
[2:15:29.960 --> 2:15:37.160]  that exact one the the sorry it's it just it's hysterical if you can smell sarin you're dead
[2:15:37.160 --> 2:15:40.440]  we're gonna come right back and i'm so excited you're gonna be in studio but i've got a bunch of

[2:18:08.360 --> 2:18:16.040]  right as the roman historian and senator cicero warned a powerful empire can't fall from without

[2:18:50.040 --> 2:18:54.920]  already upset but you've got to ring the alarm everywhere until others they've got to get upset
[2:18:54.920 --> 2:18:59.320]  and then take action and let congress everybody else know that we're not backing down and we're
[2:18:59.320 --> 2:19:05.080]  not going to sell america out to the chicoms one of the most frequently asked questions we get in
[2:19:05.080 --> 2:19:11.320]  customer service is what is the real red pill and what is the real red pill plus well real red
[2:19:11.320 --> 2:19:17.800]  pill is a vitamin mineral multivitamin high quality with pregleno real red pill plus is the
[2:19:17.800 --> 2:19:23.800]  same thing with a little bit of clean added energy on top of it as well that kicks in in 30
[2:19:23.800 --> 2:19:30.760]  minutes but the pregleno kicks in in about a week or so folks look into pregleno for yourself
[2:19:30.760 --> 2:19:35.480]  look in the high end sources of it like real red pill and real red pill plus and then you'll
[2:19:35.480 --> 2:19:40.440]  definitely want to try it out and see the effects you get within about seven days to two weeks
[2:19:40.440 --> 2:19:46.040]  generally but believe me it's a missing link you need to find out about it as we age pregleno
[2:19:46.040 --> 2:19:51.160]  levels go down all of our hormones in our body are manufactured by the body using pregleno
[2:19:51.160 --> 2:19:57.000]  you need to learn about pregleno and then you need to get the real red pill or the real red pill
[2:19:57.000 --> 2:20:19.640]  plus now 50 off at infowarslife.com the real red pill plus you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:20:27.960 --> 2:20:34.200]  Gary porch is a huge whistleblower and it seems like a five months ago but it just dropped last
[2:20:34.200 --> 2:20:39.880]  week of so many videos out on project veritas he wouldn't tell me what it was i wouldn't give me a
[2:20:39.880 --> 2:20:46.360]  hint but he says either today or tomorrow i think it's tomorrow now huge next step in all of this
[2:20:46.360 --> 2:20:50.680]  and i mean just wet my appetite i mean you're not going to tell us who it is or what it is but
[2:20:50.680 --> 2:20:57.400]  what area is it at cnn um if it's anything of what i think it might be again i'm sure you can
[2:20:57.400 --> 2:21:02.680]  understand and appreciate the uh the secrecy and and not uh not blowing the whistle so to speak
[2:21:02.680 --> 2:21:07.080]  again i don't want to take anything away from the delivery but it's it's going to be good and um
[2:21:07.720 --> 2:21:13.080]  it's definitely may involve some more top level people so that's all i'm going to say for now i'm
[2:21:13.080 --> 2:21:18.280]  sure you can understand and i understand yeah sure so so do you think jeff zucker is very happy
[2:21:18.280 --> 2:21:25.560]  about this they had a cnn um i can imagine the exact opposite of it to have some low level contractor
[2:21:25.560 --> 2:21:31.560]  like me um you know just record some stuff on the nine a.m. call it is pretty much open to anybody
[2:21:31.560 --> 2:21:36.920]  in any bureau i mean it most days i walked in the bureau alex is that someone had it on speakerphone
[2:21:36.920 --> 2:21:42.760]  so it's not like me trying to do some you know evil 007 villain type thing that to sneak into to the
[2:21:42.760 --> 2:21:49.960]  morning call i mean it's literally on speakerphone on every floor almost every day so um it's just
[2:21:49.960 --> 2:21:54.200]  there and that was again part of the key thing i started kind of raising my antenna just kind of
[2:21:54.200 --> 2:21:59.320]  see hey something's not quite passing the smell test here so and that's what kind of led me down
[2:21:59.320 --> 2:22:03.400]  the rabbit hole for lack of a better word well i'm really impressed with what you've done of
[2:22:03.400 --> 2:22:07.720]  course i'm obviously impressed with the great folks at project veritas that's what real journalism
[2:22:07.720 --> 2:22:11.880]  is supposed to be doing and imagine if cnn was doing real undercover stuff that as you were saying
[2:22:11.880 --> 2:22:16.120]  and the other employees were saying and crew members i mean they're real crooks are in congress
[2:22:16.120 --> 2:22:21.000]  and you know here's trump who really is not doing things as business as usual he really is the president
[2:22:21.000 --> 2:22:24.920]  they're trying to take him down now we talked about this some off air and i'm like well that's
[2:22:24.920 --> 2:22:32.440]  powerful please say that on air why did you do this uh and can you speak more to the attitude at
[2:22:32.440 --> 2:22:38.360]  cnn towards other media and how they're pushing censorship absolutely alex i mean it's it's not
[2:22:38.360 --> 2:22:43.560]  some big grandiose motive like i truly just as the tape said the first one that broke like i just
[2:22:43.560 --> 2:22:48.840]  wanted to do what i could to protect the republic to actually give the next you know the next four
[2:22:48.840 --> 2:22:53.720]  years the next eight years whatever the next generation my future child like to give them as
[2:22:53.720 --> 2:22:58.440]  fair and free in election as as possible like have all the information out there let you make
[2:22:58.440 --> 2:23:04.520]  up your own mind without someone's finger on the scale that's that's truly what i wanted and for
[2:23:04.520 --> 2:23:09.400]  that's you know i've you know pretty much lost everything and uh just like any other people
[2:23:09.400 --> 2:23:14.200]  like the google guys i mean what was that um the other google insider he was a direct report to
[2:23:14.200 --> 2:23:20.360]  sundar pachai and i'm sure they blackballed him in tech i mean it's just we see something wrong and
[2:23:20.360 --> 2:23:24.920]  we just hope we have the courage and fortitude to do something about it i mean it was the scariest
[2:23:24.920 --> 2:23:30.360]  thing i did i'm still scared i mean obviously i'm not gonna try to lie and say i'm not i mean we're
[2:23:30.360 --> 2:23:36.840]  still kind of scared about what may happen next but we had to do it and we did well the big corporations
[2:23:36.840 --> 2:23:41.400]  working with china won a global social score so in the future you blow a whistle on corruption
[2:23:41.400 --> 2:23:46.280]  you can't buy or sell i mean that's really the final equation they won and we have to fight that
[2:23:46.280 --> 2:23:51.240]  and say no to that it's why these castle societies are are are so incredibly dangerous but for now
[2:23:51.880 --> 2:23:55.720]  you're fighting we're fighting and we're still in a fighting position but we've really got to fight
[2:23:55.720 --> 2:24:01.240]  as you said as hard as we can for the future of course you're talking about zack vorhees we want
[2:24:01.240 --> 2:24:08.520]  to get back on in the very near future high level whistleblower and just showing devastating
[2:24:08.520 --> 2:24:14.520]  how google is premeditatedly trying trying to fix these elections uh look at tulsi gabberts
[2:24:14.520 --> 2:24:18.120]  she says look hillary's already running she just hasn't announced it quit hide mine other
[2:24:18.120 --> 2:24:23.240]  candidates come out hillary hillary calls her a russian asset with no proof but listen
[2:24:23.240 --> 2:24:27.800]  they say that in congress about me they use that to deplatform us no proof
[2:24:27.800 --> 2:24:33.800]  no facing our accusers i have no connection to russia and it's just it's so dangerous
[2:24:35.160 --> 2:24:39.640]  yeah you go against the uh the mainstream narrative and the mainstream talking heads of
[2:24:39.640 --> 2:24:46.120]  course you and many others like you are you know smeared as as russian people and it blows my mind
[2:24:46.120 --> 2:24:51.720]  that that this is where we're at right now that information is so is so powerful that they just
[2:24:51.720 --> 2:24:55.880]  want to restrict it to a single pipeline or a handful of pipelines that are you know
[2:24:55.880 --> 2:25:01.080]  authoritative sources as uh was it would just because the youtube ceo like we're going to prop up
[2:25:01.080 --> 2:25:06.760]  authoritative sources all the mainstream outlets and deplatform or or d boost or whatever the term
[2:25:06.760 --> 2:25:11.480]  is called like you know people like your you know your your alex jones your jimmy doors your
[2:25:11.480 --> 2:25:15.880]  tim pools all your independent people that are out there just trying to they have a fanbase and
[2:25:15.880 --> 2:25:19.560]  they're making it harder for people that are paying for that fanbase to just get the news that they
[2:25:19.560 --> 2:25:24.680]  want the you know the news that um that not only they're paying for but it's truly kind of objective
[2:25:24.680 --> 2:25:29.320]  i mean i watch ten pool almost every day and he's one of the most objective people i say and he
[2:25:29.320 --> 2:25:33.320]  owns where he's at on the spectrum hey i lean this way so what but here's the facts you make it up for
[2:25:33.320 --> 2:25:39.240]  yourself that's right this is a story up on info wars dot com hillary clinton declares bankrupt
[2:25:39.240 --> 2:25:43.960]  dnc we're going to be outgun outspent outlawed it's actually a bright white article well i've
[2:25:43.960 --> 2:25:49.960]  listened to the dnc calls she's basically running it she's going around to campaign events everywhere
[2:25:49.960 --> 2:25:54.600]  she's still collecting money at her foundation and she says we're going to be outlawed she's
[2:25:54.600 --> 2:26:00.760]  projecting on to republicans and seeing it'll have all these gumball containers saying oh 30
[2:26:00.760 --> 2:26:06.040]  thousand lies and you drill into that it's not true trump goes we had miles high of burgers
[2:26:06.040 --> 2:26:10.120]  they go actually if you stacked all the burgers they're at the white house he gave the sports team
[2:26:10.120 --> 2:26:15.720]  it would only be 500 feet tall that's not a mile high so they take all this weird stuff that's hyperbole
[2:26:15.720 --> 2:26:21.320]  by trump and then they say that you know he's like that guy's from mars well technically the senator
[2:26:21.320 --> 2:26:25.880]  is not from mars he's from you know from wherever and so they play these games but here's hillary
[2:26:25.880 --> 2:26:30.840]  saying they're gonna out lie us and and and so she's just saying we got a lot better than them
[2:26:30.840 --> 2:26:36.200]  talk about projection here it is i think we'll be a little better off than we were back then
[2:26:36.200 --> 2:26:43.000]  but we're gonna be outgunned outspent out lied i mean we're gonna have a lot of problems and
[2:26:43.640 --> 2:26:48.600]  the thing we have to out lie so so that's saying we've got a lie better i mean what does that say to
[2:26:48.600 --> 2:26:54.760]  you i mean i just and again this is just my personal opinion and i know this will anger or
[2:26:54.760 --> 2:26:59.560]  make some people happy it's just you know what in what other place can you be the literal most
[2:26:59.560 --> 2:27:05.880]  favored most um qualified candidate history and run against the tv game show host and still lose
[2:27:05.880 --> 2:27:10.600]  like that to me still blows my mind and that's back when i was a never trump or you know um
[2:27:11.480 --> 2:27:18.440]  it's i mean when people have to fact check the babel on b that's a weird it feels like the
[2:27:18.440 --> 2:27:24.200]  twilight zone like when people spend their time and whatever their salary is to fact check a known
[2:27:24.200 --> 2:27:29.320]  satire site that to me that's just bananas for lack of a better word you know that's right i've seen
[2:27:29.320 --> 2:27:39.960]  cnn and snopes now fact checking comics why do you think they're doing that just to wish to control
[2:27:39.960 --> 2:27:47.160]  everything or no i mean i say this a lot i said this to a lot of my friends like i can only dream
[2:27:47.800 --> 2:27:52.680]  if george carlin or robin williams was alive today with their own twitter account like how
[2:27:53.400 --> 2:27:58.200]  amazing would that be apparently comedy is the last bastion of free speech so that's why

[2:28:17.800 --> 2:28:22.040]  didn't agree with everything but everything was still funny even the stuff that i was trying to get

[2:33:31.720 --> 2:33:36.280]  okay gerol cement is coming up next hour but i'm gonna host 15 minutes into it because i've got
[2:33:36.280 --> 2:33:41.240]  some news i've got a hit before i leave the live airwaves i got a lot of stuff going on behind
[2:33:41.240 --> 2:33:46.040]  scenes we're gonna go to our guest here in just a moment who was at least detained i don't know
[2:33:46.040 --> 2:33:54.040]  if he was actually arrested and charged thomas bartram at the trump rally he didn't engage
[2:33:54.040 --> 2:33:59.320]  any crime up in dallas uh but we didn't just say it was a provocateur set up as an info warsluster
[2:33:59.320 --> 2:34:03.240]  we went out in research and said okay the guy that got detained by police was a lister but having a
[2:34:03.240 --> 2:34:08.040]  gun on you on the streets of dallas is not illegal especially when antifa slapped me in the head and
[2:34:08.040 --> 2:34:13.080]  punched me in the back you know i had security they got a few little swaps in when they were attacking
[2:34:13.080 --> 2:34:16.280]  families that were out there so we're gonna go to him in a moment but first i want to talk about
[2:34:16.280 --> 2:34:22.680]  victory i want to talk about success okay we just had a major cnn whistleblower on
[2:34:23.800 --> 2:34:29.400]  who reached out to project veritas himself and then secretly recorded for a year and showed the
[2:34:29.400 --> 2:34:35.400]  incredible immoral lies and corruption there and is cited in trump's lawsuit now against cnn for
[2:34:35.400 --> 2:34:40.680]  false advertising and i think that's the you know a great thing that president trump's doing because
[2:34:40.680 --> 2:34:44.760]  cnn actively is trying to destroy free speech they're trying to shut down their competition
[2:34:45.640 --> 2:34:49.800]  they are rigging debates they are just an organized crime group and i don't say that
[2:34:49.800 --> 2:34:57.880]  that in my opinion uh it's been proven and so you when we've had james though keep on years ago he'd
[2:34:57.880 --> 2:35:04.840]  say yeah i've never gotten so many calls so many threats so much pressure not to come on your show
[2:35:04.840 --> 2:35:09.000]  but i do it anyways because i know you're doing a good job and they lie about you well it's the
[2:35:09.000 --> 2:35:15.720]  same thing with somebody like carrie port she was on i guarantee you he got told not to come on here
[2:35:15.720 --> 2:35:20.840]  by people but he still came on now he wants to come in studio they want to scare everyone away
[2:35:20.840 --> 2:35:26.120]  from him for like it's dirty like it's bad but once everybody wakes up it's a badge of honor
[2:35:28.280 --> 2:35:33.240]  people say how do you take being demonized all the time with the media says trump's a nazi
[2:35:33.240 --> 2:35:39.480]  that he raped little girls none of it's true that's the democrats that have been caught doing it and
[2:35:39.480 --> 2:35:45.320]  so when a pack of criminals say all these bad things about us they're a discredited frauds that
[2:35:45.320 --> 2:35:51.560]  launch illegal wars based on lies and then march our military off and they're being caught and
[2:35:51.560 --> 2:35:55.320]  they're being exposed that's why they're trying to shut everybody down because used to they were
[2:35:55.320 --> 2:36:01.000]  arrogant now they realize they're losing so they're really showing their hand so yes it's rough in the
[2:36:01.000 --> 2:36:08.600]  interim to go through this but as long as we can stay on air and stay in position we're here
[2:36:08.600 --> 2:36:13.480]  so we can have big whistleblowers on like that as we can magnify what project veritas does
[2:36:14.440 --> 2:36:18.840]  i'm not tooting our horn it's the truth james oakheave has said on air that upwards of half
[2:36:18.840 --> 2:36:23.640]  the whistleblowers they get is from info horse now i could have our own whistleblower division
[2:36:24.440 --> 2:36:29.800]  and i could sit there and and and say call us do we'll do it no veritas is great you can come to
[2:36:29.800 --> 2:36:34.280]  us too people always come on us after they go on veritas and sometimes we have whistleblowers
[2:36:34.280 --> 2:36:39.160]  that's fine but sometimes we get really powerful stuff and that's really complex and i give them
[2:36:39.160 --> 2:36:44.520]  to james oakheave he knows that because i see james all over the news and doing great i love it
[2:36:44.520 --> 2:36:50.760]  they've sued him they tried to put him in prison they tried to infiltrate him we're brothers together
[2:36:50.760 --> 2:36:57.000]  in this fight folks this is the real deal so i'm gonna tell us for something i got so excited
[2:36:57.000 --> 2:37:01.560]  last hour that guest i didn't plug one time if i don't plug every hour bare minimum we're going
[2:37:01.560 --> 2:37:07.640]  to shut down in about 14 15 months well i've explained this and it makes the enemy really
[2:37:07.640 --> 2:37:12.760]  happy and i don't want but i have to get to the point of explaining this i'm selling out of all
[2:37:12.760 --> 2:37:18.440]  our stock to continue to fund us and i'm selling a lot of it at cost and we're gonna get in a
[2:37:18.440 --> 2:37:23.480]  position where i'm not even able to order a lot of the basic stuff in the future books films t-shirts
[2:37:23.480 --> 2:37:30.120]  supplements to be able to then have it and sell it to you because we have this stuff on stock we
[2:37:30.120 --> 2:37:34.440]  don't sit there and drop ship this stuff or or we are drop shipping and air filters for
[2:37:34.440 --> 2:37:40.120]  well food they have it you know that's why you get it in days so now's the time to think about
[2:37:40.120 --> 2:37:43.960]  what info wars is done and what you've done by supporting us to the investment you've made
[2:37:43.960 --> 2:37:48.680]  you get great products at the same time so listen we have limited edition shirts i designed this
[2:37:48.680 --> 2:37:52.760]  shirt from an acid design red white blue flag info wars dot com i said it would be limited
[2:37:52.760 --> 2:37:56.600]  edition it is the best seller because i said it was a limited edition that we'd only sell
[2:37:57.640 --> 2:38:03.560]  in 2019 and it came out like four four five months ago i told them no more orders for it two weeks
[2:38:03.560 --> 2:38:09.400]  ago what we have is what we have now i'm gonna do a different variant of it but then it's gone
[2:38:10.760 --> 2:38:15.720]  that's it so whether it's the trump hillary medusa shirt or whether it is the classic info
[2:38:15.720 --> 2:38:25.160]  wars shirt they're all there now by the way and i haven't talked about this yet and i want to do it
[2:38:25.160 --> 2:38:32.520]  justice but i uh well i mean i'll get to it later the point is is that we want to have an iconic shirt
[2:38:33.960 --> 2:38:39.160]  that is for the 2020 election we had the big iconic shirt 2016 hillary for prison and i've
[2:38:39.160 --> 2:38:44.680]  been searching and i've been thinking and it hit me in plain view it's the trump medusa shirt with
[2:38:44.680 --> 2:38:53.800]  hillary severed head and i was already thinking that saturday and then i was watching a katlyn
[2:38:53.800 --> 2:38:57.720]  benett video where she was interviewing trump supporters he was wearing one of our shirts
[2:38:57.720 --> 2:39:00.920]  they said man i don't know why i don't see more of this shirt out here it's the most popular shirt
[2:39:00.920 --> 2:39:05.080]  when people see it they all want one i'm glad i got one and i went wait she's running for president
[2:39:05.640 --> 2:39:10.920]  she's planning to remove trump before she does that's the 2020 shirt i really think so we have a
[2:39:10.920 --> 2:39:17.640]  new version that says trump 2020 and then the trump medusa so this will be a limited edition the one
[2:39:17.640 --> 2:39:21.960]  that doesn't say that get yours today at infowarstore.com we're gonna go to our guest here in just a
[2:39:21.960 --> 2:39:26.840]  moment i appreciate him holding while we do this but get your shirt today now separately
[2:39:28.600 --> 2:39:33.080]  ladies and gentlemen we have bio truce selenium it's the best selenium you're gonna find from

[2:39:37.960 --> 2:39:43.480]  must have selenium it's one of the biggest deficiencies and problems out there and the FDA
[2:39:43.480 --> 2:39:47.640]  keeps lowering the amount that you supposedly have and saying fluoride's good for you when all
[2:39:47.640 --> 2:39:51.080]  the studies say i look this fellow's actually got his bottle look at the fellow we're about to go
[2:39:51.080 --> 2:39:56.760]  to if you punch him up real quick uh our guest there guys just a bunch up skype it's okay

[2:40:14.200 --> 2:40:21.400]  powerful and you take it with the iodine it's next level the iodine conspiracy just research
[2:40:21.400 --> 2:40:26.920]  lowering IQ lowering fertility all of it you don't have iodine you break down you have major
[2:40:26.920 --> 2:40:30.840]  problems that's why they take the iodine out it's out of the soils it's been depleted and they put
[2:40:30.840 --> 2:40:36.440]  the bad halogen the fluoride in this is so game-changing yes i'm selling a product yes it's
[2:40:36.440 --> 2:40:46.680]  a pitch but the plug is one infinity true it's absolute it's total this is so important and

[2:40:55.080 --> 2:41:01.800]  documents news clips all the incredible facts but it just hit me like two weeks ago if we just get
[2:41:01.800 --> 2:41:06.840]  people to see what real pure iodine does with selenium then everybody'll order it they'll
[2:41:06.840 --> 2:41:10.680]  reorder it and then they'll tell others and it'll be a chain reaction and just as i started promoting
[2:41:10.680 --> 2:41:14.280]  iodine eight years ago when i figured this out talking to top scientists and others literally
[2:41:15.560 --> 2:41:19.080]  once i learned about it i people told me about it my whole life i just wasn't listening

[2:41:35.960 --> 2:41:41.080]  and iodine you have to have to live and it's depleted everywhere and people that don't live

[2:44:13.160 --> 2:44:17.480]  above the law that doesn't pay taxes that has diplomatic immunity that runs around saying
[2:44:17.480 --> 2:44:22.760]  it's communist and socialist power to the people but then meanwhile is tax exempt again offshore

[2:45:13.560 --> 2:45:19.400]  already true i didn't predict all this it was already going on now the globalists are making
[2:45:19.400 --> 2:45:25.960]  their move with the chai cons so it's naked it's brazen this is the point when the enemy emerges
[2:45:25.960 --> 2:45:30.120]  it's like before world war two the polls kept warning that nazi germany was going to attack
[2:45:30.120 --> 2:45:35.800]  them nobody believed them as they saw the troops massing until it finally happened we're at that
[2:45:35.800 --> 2:45:41.080]  same point and we're all paul reviers who need to be out there warning everyone about what's

[2:47:20.840 --> 2:47:27.480]  well our guests got arrested at the trump rally last thursday when i was driving around an
[2:47:27.480 --> 2:47:32.920]  armored vehicle and andy was physically attacking people what did he do nothing the police also stood
[2:47:32.920 --> 2:47:39.240]  down when andy started attacking us and the guys out with her very pro police you know a couple of
[2:47:39.240 --> 2:47:43.320]  them been police officers in their previous careers they just never seen anything like it we went
[2:47:43.320 --> 2:47:48.360]  over the cops we have some help they're just like nope walked off dallas had a lot of areas of texas
[2:47:48.360 --> 2:47:53.080]  really have become shameful uh a lot of the cops were smiling away but it didn't matter the ones we
[2:47:53.080 --> 2:47:59.800]  went over to were told nope i guess they let them beat up the old ladies as well uh but to thomas
[2:47:59.800 --> 2:48:04.920]  barkroom is about to join us here's some of the local newscast hi brine and meredith yeah
[2:48:04.920 --> 2:48:10.280]  we just learned that the man who was taken into custody was transported to a local hospital
[2:48:10.280 --> 2:48:15.880]  for evaluation here is what happened a crowd of about a hundred people were protesting the
[2:48:15.880 --> 2:48:22.600]  troop pullout in syria when a man wearing a helmet backpack and bulletproof vest walked towards them
[2:48:22.600 --> 2:48:28.840]  dallas police detained the man and found a pistol in his front pocket police confiscated a gas mask
[2:48:28.840 --> 2:48:35.400]  knee pads some sort of aerosol can mace and a video camera among other items we were there when the
[2:48:35.400 --> 2:48:42.760]  man who was wearing an infill wars t-shirt was taken away in a police cruiser that's a scary
[2:48:42.760 --> 2:48:49.880]  situation uh we we i guess we put our life on the line to to voice out our opinion about our
[2:48:49.880 --> 2:48:57.560]  our people and uh sweet antifa oh police tell us that man did have a license to carry that weapon
[2:48:57.560 --> 2:49:03.000]  he was taken into custody without incident and again tonight he is being evaluated at a hospital
[2:49:03.000 --> 2:49:07.400]  brine
[2:49:11.080 --> 2:49:15.080]  notice you can see his infill war shirt but the media sure got that info that is an infill
[2:49:15.080 --> 2:49:20.280]  war shirt though it's a good look at when that one has the sword for the shield uh came with that
[2:49:20.280 --> 2:49:26.040]  design so i thought hey let's find out if this was a stage to vent to demonizes and then we actually
[2:49:26.040 --> 2:49:31.240]  talked to the guy and he's like no and he was out there attacking people and so i thought you know
[2:49:31.240 --> 2:49:35.480]  i'd go out there but you got you've got the optics but he had every right and even was out there
[2:49:35.480 --> 2:49:42.280]  dressed like that actually attacking people uh so uh let's find out who thomas bar trim is
[2:49:42.280 --> 2:49:46.120]  he's a proud Texan and patriot who wants to do whatever he can to help save the country and benefit
[2:49:46.120 --> 2:49:51.400]  mankind dallas news is sensationalized his presence the trump rally where he was in possession of a
[2:49:51.400 --> 2:49:56.680]  legal firearm wearing a helmet and an import t-shirt was taken into custody make my driveway
[2:49:56.680 --> 2:50:01.800]  great again dot com he is going to powerwashing company uh so that's a big strike against him
[2:50:01.800 --> 2:50:06.120]  he he he works so so tell us who you really are and what really happened thanks for coming on
[2:50:08.360 --> 2:50:13.480]  well you know as you said i'm a patriot um you know i love this country and originally
[2:50:13.480 --> 2:50:17.800]  i wasn't going to go to the trump rally but the the moment uh the moment you came on air and said
[2:50:17.800 --> 2:50:23.000]  you're going to be down there i i've seen you before um at that one baby girl rally you did
[2:50:23.000 --> 2:50:28.520]  earlier uh i think this year or last year and i mean they swarmed on you they were attacking you
[2:50:28.520 --> 2:50:32.840]  and the thing that was going through my mind was like look i need to be out there i need to be out
[2:50:32.840 --> 2:50:35.880]  there because i know what they're going to do to them they're going to try to attack them they're
[2:50:35.880 --> 2:50:40.200]  going to throw things at them there's no telling what kind of things they could do um you know we
[2:50:40.200 --> 2:50:45.080]  were very concerned about the president so uh when i heard you're going to be out there i loaded up
[2:50:45.080 --> 2:50:51.160]  my truck grabbed everything i could think of and just just went there uh when i got there i threw
[2:50:51.160 --> 2:50:54.600]  on my vest threw on my helmet because we know they're throwing acid at people we know they hit
[2:50:54.600 --> 2:50:59.000]  people in the back of the head with bike locks uh you know i had a bike backpack full of all gear
[2:50:59.000 --> 2:51:03.320]  and my plan was i was going there i was going to try to find you and meet up with you uh you know
[2:51:03.320 --> 2:51:09.480]  to help do whatever i could uh uh keep anti-fill off your back uh within 60 seconds of me showing up
[2:51:09.480 --> 2:51:14.600]  at the trump rally i walked over there and i saw this huge crowd of people uh protesting Kurdistan
[2:51:14.600 --> 2:51:18.360]  or whatever and i was just looking at them trying to figure out all right which group of people are
[2:51:18.360 --> 2:51:21.400]  these guys with i mean what are they what are they even protesting i'm just standing there
[2:51:21.400 --> 2:51:26.760]  looking at them the next thing i know i got you know five cops all over me uh you know stripping
[2:51:26.760 --> 2:51:34.840]  me down searching all my stuff um but yeah i mean everything i had in that backpack was like directly
[2:51:34.840 --> 2:51:41.240]  related to like uh body bodyguard security stuff that aerosol can was a fire extinguisher had a gas
[2:51:41.240 --> 2:51:45.400]  mask there's no telling what sort of stuff they're gonna what they're gonna bring out they're gonna
[2:51:45.400 --> 2:51:52.040]  do i had a trauma kit in there um you know chest seals um you know anything i could think of in
[2:51:52.040 --> 2:51:55.960]  there so i mean it was just you know anti-fuzz allowed they're allowed to come out there wearing
[2:51:55.960 --> 2:51:59.960]  whatever they want they can come out there in a motorcycle helmet they can bring whatever sort
[2:51:59.960 --> 2:52:04.600]  of nonsense to cause trouble nothing ever happens to them but i guess when i do it uh it's a big deal
[2:52:05.320 --> 2:52:09.480]  um so you went out there in case they attacked me well i didn't know that well i i appreciate
[2:52:09.480 --> 2:52:13.720]  you trying to support uh us i mean you can i'm not defending what the police did because they
[2:52:13.720 --> 2:52:17.240]  they stood down let and if i actually attack us and then we just you know left that area
[2:52:17.960 --> 2:52:21.320]  they were attacking men women and children as well kind of shameful the dallas did that i guess
[2:52:21.320 --> 2:52:25.480]  they're like portland now but what did you say to the police when they came over and talked to you
[2:52:25.480 --> 2:52:28.520]  and then i heard that they psychologically i guess they tried to red flag you what happened
[2:52:30.200 --> 2:52:34.200]  yeah that's something i want to be clear on with the police because in any kind of situation like
[2:52:34.200 --> 2:52:39.080]  this um it's very hard to do intent it's very hard to know what they were thinking i haven't talked to
[2:52:39.080 --> 2:52:43.720]  them since but i do know the facts of what happened to me because for all i know i mean they could
[2:52:43.720 --> 2:52:47.480]  have said that thought oh he's he's antifa let's get him out of here because we don't want him
[2:52:47.480 --> 2:52:52.120]  attacking people but even then even from that angle even if i was antifa i would still have a
[2:52:52.120 --> 2:52:56.360]  right to free speech i'd still have a right to be out there so i mean you know anyway you look at
[2:52:56.360 --> 2:53:01.560]  it it doesn't look good but uh one thing i want to do here i definitely don't want to uh try to
[2:53:01.560 --> 2:53:07.000]  assume the intent of the police and like what they were doing um but i do know that i was legally
[2:53:07.000 --> 2:53:12.360]  armed i was out there um i wasn't hurting anybody i wasn't doing anything what did they say to you
[2:53:12.360 --> 2:53:18.680]  where did they take you they said they put you in a hospital what unfolded yeah so i i got out there
[2:53:18.680 --> 2:53:23.000]  they took me over the police fan and they started asking oh do you know do you like alex jones uh are
[2:53:23.000 --> 2:53:26.760]  you are you homicidal or you're suicidal do you want to hurt people well what do you think about
[2:53:26.760 --> 2:53:31.000]  nine eleven uh you know do you think there's uh what do you think about sandy hook and then
[2:53:31.000 --> 2:53:34.280]  they're like all right well we're going to send you off to a psych hospital because we think you're
[2:53:34.280 --> 2:53:40.200]  crazy uh and we'll let them sort you out and i was released from there within four hours uh because
[2:53:40.200 --> 2:53:44.200]  the psychiatrist looking at me were like no he's not crazy like within four hours they're like
[2:53:44.200 --> 2:53:50.520]  no this and and i'm lucky too because all of what we've taken is for me i guess i i happen to go to
[2:53:50.520 --> 2:53:56.120]  a hospital where um the psychiatrists have some degree of integrity because if i got sent to
[2:53:56.120 --> 2:54:00.440]  some leftist whatever hospital and they're like oh this guy supports enforcers there's no telling
[2:54:00.440 --> 2:54:05.560]  i mean i could still leave you alone or something well let's expand on that because i will make
[2:54:05.560 --> 2:54:14.520]  statements about the police in dallas this time they are becoming nothing but leftist and the city's
[2:54:14.520 --> 2:54:21.000]  run by leftist now it's my hometown it's very shameful that's propaganda i have a right to
[2:54:21.000 --> 2:54:26.040]  question sandy hook we've seen so many staged events so many things that have come out that
[2:54:26.040 --> 2:54:31.000]  aren't true i mean small it staging stuff babies and incubators that weren't there having their
[2:54:31.000 --> 2:54:35.960]  brains bashed out to launch wars uh you know fake kids being nerve-gassed in syria and they admit
[2:54:35.960 --> 2:54:40.920]  the kids weren't killed and they told them to do it as actors so we have a right but i hardly ever
[2:54:40.920 --> 2:54:46.840]  cover sandy hook i'm famous we helped get trump elected so the democrats say i'm the sandy hook
[2:54:46.840 --> 2:54:51.720]  got to give them attention for all their anti-gun stuff and to bring sandy hook back up and i'm
[2:54:51.720 --> 2:54:58.280]  tired of them doing that it's very cold-blooded and you know the system has sued the dead teacher
[2:54:58.280 --> 2:55:02.680]  they've sued the school they've sued the school district they've sued everybody and you know it's
[2:55:02.680 --> 2:55:07.240]  seven years later and so but i just love the police oh what do you think about sandy hook what about
[2:55:07.240 --> 2:55:13.320]  9 11 because it's in all these tv shows and movies like the good doctor last monday where oh if you
[2:55:13.320 --> 2:55:19.400]  question that there might be a cover-up of all of 9 11 you're a crazy person the senate admits the 28
[2:55:19.400 --> 2:55:24.360]  pages that there was a cover-up that the government knew and stood down and the saudi arabians and all
[2:55:24.360 --> 2:55:28.760]  the fbi agents went public and said that they were told to stand down they tried to stop the flight
[2:55:28.760 --> 2:55:39.560]  school stuff so again that's crazy it's crazy to not ask questions yeah absolutely i mean that's uh
[2:55:40.120 --> 2:55:43.640]  you know and that that's what people will tell you i mean they they're everyone i talk to you
[2:55:43.640 --> 2:55:47.480]  about you they're like oh oh he's crazy he doesn't know what he's talking about you know he's a con
[2:55:47.480 --> 2:55:52.120]  man i mean you know people uh people who aren't in the nose still think that like you know i had
[2:55:52.120 --> 2:55:56.360]  someone the other day tell me like oh well he's a he's a pervert because i still think like the
[2:55:56.360 --> 2:56:03.560]  child porn thing was real i mean it's like uh you know it's it's ridiculous um and again since we
[2:56:03.560 --> 2:56:09.800]  mentioned that we had nine plus million unopened emails the judge who's been called up by the
[2:56:09.800 --> 2:56:16.040]  supreme court is what she's doing says yeah you know give us all of them and then we give them the
[2:56:16.040 --> 2:56:21.720]  emails and then they find hidden attachments sent once the suit happened hidden it's code
[2:56:23.720 --> 2:56:29.720]  they find that and then say that i sent it to children when it was their law firm requesting
[2:56:29.720 --> 2:56:34.600]  the emails having them scanned why the hell would you be scanning them for hidden stuff
[2:56:35.320 --> 2:56:41.240]  unopened and that turns me into the child porn king when the democrats are known to be a bunch
[2:56:41.240 --> 2:56:46.760]  of pedos and they're so pissed i've exposed them so that's just their little message to me whoever
[2:56:46.760 --> 2:56:54.520]  did it so incredible my friend keep going sorry yeah i mean that's that's what's going on here but um
[2:56:54.520 --> 2:56:59.560]  oh and they also stole my gun uh my my uh my everyday carrier my favorite little uh double
[2:56:59.560 --> 2:57:04.600]  stack nine millimeter that's uh that's currently still the property room uh down in Dallas and
[2:57:04.600 --> 2:57:11.960]  supposedly i maybe might get it back in 46 weeks so uh i don't i have backups but uh so that also
[2:57:11.960 --> 2:57:16.760]  happens that's where this is all going look you're doing a great job i think you're a real
[2:57:16.760 --> 2:57:21.320]  guy and i love me to death and let me just tell anybody else comes up to me i get it if it gets
[2:57:21.320 --> 2:57:24.520]  addressed up in street battle gear and you have every right in america when the terror grips
[2:57:24.520 --> 2:57:29.560]  running around if you're gonna go to political thing to protect yourself um i just think that uh
[2:57:29.560 --> 2:57:35.160]  that that that that it might be in danger from the future because some police departments work
[2:57:35.160 --> 2:57:39.320]  for the left now it came out in internal documents with antifa they could set you up
[2:57:39.960 --> 2:57:43.640]  and i because there are leftists in all these departments now and and and they're the left
[2:57:43.640 --> 2:57:48.120]  that are terrorist uh and so you've got to be careful so next time you probably don't want to

[2:59:59.080 --> 3:00:01.080]  so
[3:00:10.920 --> 3:00:15.800]  spineless from the start on corruption it's alex jones apart
[3:00:20.760 --> 3:00:26.120]  we claim i'm spineless i lie all day i make money off tanya didn't make a dime
[3:00:26.120 --> 3:00:34.200]  those lawyers live off of it lumen's all in its quit sign let me let me say one more thing about all
[3:00:34.200 --> 3:00:46.520]  this we had carrie corch on earlier big whistleblower we're from cnn and you know he was just talking
[3:00:46.520 --> 3:00:52.520]  about how they demonize him for wars now they attack me that's a badge of honor from these people
[3:00:52.520 --> 3:00:57.880]  ladies and gentlemen project veritas tweeted it out that's a badge of honor to be attacked
[3:00:58.920 --> 3:01:03.400]  by these individuals they want to control the narrative they want to put out whatever
[3:01:03.400 --> 3:01:08.360]  disinformation they want but it's not working and the people that count see through it but
[3:01:08.360 --> 3:01:11.960]  that's why we need to stay on air do you imagine how bad it would be the lies if we weren't here to
[3:01:11.960 --> 3:01:20.200]  counter them because they see this operation as a spirit of americana it's really just that simple
[3:01:20.200 --> 3:01:23.640]  and we're not backing down there are a lot of good police across this country but take
[3:01:24.680 --> 3:01:29.880]  take uh carrie porch he got an offer from the head of dps or the head of icent over texas
[3:01:30.600 --> 3:01:33.720]  to come down here and run a whole hr department because he's got the background in that
[3:01:34.440 --> 3:01:38.280]  so see that's how one door closes another door opens so it's not everybody in law enforcement
[3:01:38.280 --> 3:01:43.000]  that's bad most of them aren't because i had them say that they're killing babies in cages
[3:01:43.000 --> 3:01:49.080]  none of that's true just like they lie about me and say i'm a child porn kingpin i mean it's it's
[3:01:49.080 --> 3:01:55.880]  it's and i followed lawsuits already over that i mean this is a war people and so the police ought
[3:01:55.880 --> 3:01:59.960]  to be smarter than that when the media's saying i'm a bad person the police ought to go well they
[3:01:59.960 --> 3:02:06.840]  say we're bad finishing up with thomas bartram artram uh make my driveway great again dot com

[3:02:40.360 --> 3:02:44.920]  officers about the second amendment and they said to me this is this is what i don't know if this

[3:02:48.040 --> 3:02:52.840]  look we the city can make walls that go against the second amendment we don't have to follow the
[3:02:52.840 --> 3:02:57.880]  second amendment we're allowed to the state is the constitution that's not true it's a fraud those

[3:05:03.160 --> 3:05:09.720]  viewers who info wars your support i got your help in rebooting americana is a challenge to the
[3:05:09.720 --> 3:05:15.400]  globalist system of corporate tyranny has really caught hold not just here in the u.s. worldwide
[3:05:15.400 --> 3:05:21.960]  and president trump's fearlessness when it comes to promoting americana and basic liberty is amazing
[3:05:21.960 --> 3:05:27.480]  as well he's still lacking on the big tech censorship taking action against that in some
[3:05:27.480 --> 3:05:32.040]  other areas but trying to end the wars boosting our economy speaking out against kindness china
[3:05:32.680 --> 3:05:37.480]  trumps been doing an amazing job but now more than ever we really have to realize that
[3:05:38.200 --> 3:05:44.040]  we're being targeted because we are effective and the globalists are beginning to lose their war
[3:05:44.040 --> 3:05:48.680]  against humanity in a big way and so we're going to see some major fireworks out of them
[3:05:48.680 --> 3:05:54.520]  but it's critical to not let ourselves get down when we see all the poison they spray at us
[3:05:54.520 --> 3:05:59.720]  that's an attempt to demoralize us we've got to remember that and stay focused and stay happy
[3:06:02.920 --> 3:06:09.560]  he's 35 years old worth close to a hundred billion dollars he founded and runs the largest
[3:06:09.560 --> 3:06:15.720]  and most powerful internet company in the world with close to three billion users his name is
[3:06:15.720 --> 3:06:22.440]  mark zuckerberg and he's standing on a stage proclaiming his defense of free speech and the
[3:06:22.440 --> 3:06:29.160]  first amendment at georgetown university i'm here today because i believe that we must continue
[3:06:29.160 --> 3:06:36.040]  to stand for free expression free speech is for everybody even the crazies that's the very definition
[3:06:36.040 --> 3:06:42.440]  of free speech in a free country everyone can be heard in totalitarian societies only the powerful
[3:06:42.440 --> 3:06:48.360]  can be heard the most repressive societies have always restricted speech the most and when people
[3:06:48.360 --> 3:06:53.480]  are finally able to speak they often use their voice to call for change and i understand the
[3:06:53.480 --> 3:06:59.800]  concerns uh that people have about how tech platforms have have centralized power but even
[3:06:59.800 --> 3:07:05.160]  american tradition recognizes that some speech infringes on other people's rights inevitably
[3:07:05.160 --> 3:07:10.600]  some people are going to use their voice to try to organize violence to try to undermine elections
[3:07:10.600 --> 3:07:16.760]  to to hurt others and we have a responsibility to address these risks because when you're serving
[3:07:16.760 --> 3:07:22.920]  billions of people even if a very small percent of them cause harm that can still be a lot of harm
[3:07:23.800 --> 3:07:31.000]  apple facebook spotify vimeo youtube twitter all of them pulled or froze jones's accounts on the
[3:07:31.000 --> 3:07:36.680]  grounds that his views are too dangerous to be heard publicly the left which seeks to crush
[3:07:36.680 --> 3:07:41.400]  anything it can't control applauded the news i believe that we have two responsibilities
[3:07:42.360 --> 3:07:46.840]  to remove content when it can cause real danger as effectively as we can
[3:07:47.880 --> 3:07:54.600]  and to fight to uphold as wide of a definition of freedom of expression as possible and to not
[3:07:54.600 --> 3:07:59.480]  allow the definition of what is considered dangerous to expand beyond what is absolutely
[3:07:59.480 --> 3:08:05.720]  necessary and that's what i'm committed to how dangerous is info wars well facebook believes
[3:08:05.720 --> 3:08:12.040]  it's so dangerous that you can be banned from using the platform facebook just for sharing its content
[3:08:12.040 --> 3:08:17.160]  unless you simultaneously denounce it let that penetrate for just one moment think about it
[3:08:17.160 --> 3:08:23.320]  just for a second mark zuckerberg is not simply censoring opinions he's prescribing which political
[3:08:23.320 --> 3:08:29.320]  opinions you're allowed to have which conversations all of us in this country can have about a
[3:08:29.320 --> 3:08:35.720]  america keep in mind that nobody voted for mark zuckerberg he's 34 years old he's completely cut
[3:08:35.720 --> 3:08:41.640]  off from reality he's worth 72 billion dollars and yet he can singlehandedly make our first
[3:08:41.640 --> 3:08:48.440]  amendment irrelevant after 250 years now i know many people disagree with this but in general
[3:08:48.440 --> 3:08:53.960]  i don't think it's right for a private company to censor politicians or the news in a democracy
[3:08:53.960 --> 3:09:00.120]  so as a principal in a democracy i believe that people should decide what is credible
[3:09:00.120 --> 3:09:06.600]  not tech companies now of course there are exceptions and even for politicians we're not
[3:09:06.600 --> 3:09:11.160]  going to allow content that incites violence or or risks imminent harm and of course we don't
[3:09:11.160 --> 3:09:17.400]  allow voter suppression our voting is voice a lot of our political debate takes place on social
[3:09:17.400 --> 3:09:21.000]  media platforms so if they clamp down on one side of the debate why wouldn't that influence
[3:09:21.000 --> 3:09:26.520]  elections outcome democracy depends on the idea that we hold each other's right to express
[3:09:26.520 --> 3:09:31.960]  ourselves and be heard above our desire to always get the outcomes that we want but it's not really
[3:09:31.960 --> 3:09:37.960]  about alex jones is it it's about the idea that companies can make it impossible for your voice
[3:09:37.960 --> 3:09:42.680]  to be heard is that a precedent we should be comfortable with because while we may disagree on
[3:09:42.680 --> 3:09:49.960]  exactly where to draw the line on specific issues we at least can disagree that's what free expression
[3:09:49.960 --> 3:09:56.440]  is people know what's true they can smell it you can't stop them from knowing that you can't
[3:09:56.440 --> 3:10:02.360]  control their minds you can only humiliate yourself and undermine your own authority by trying our
[3:10:02.360 --> 3:10:07.720]  childish billionaire overlords may be geniuses they say they are but they don't understand that someday
[3:10:07.720 --> 3:10:14.760]  soon they will learn and that is a comforting thought at a time like this why is zuckerberg telling
[3:10:14.760 --> 3:10:21.640]  a lie this transparent well on the surface he's just repeating what the ceo of youtube said in
[3:10:21.640 --> 3:10:27.720]  late august that they never censor and that youtube and google are totally open for everyone to say
[3:10:27.720 --> 3:10:34.200]  and do whatever they want as long as it isn't illegal info wars tested that and relaunched
[3:10:34.200 --> 3:10:42.280]  a youtube channel it was banned within four hours and right out of 1984 the youtube ceo said we are
[3:10:42.280 --> 3:10:50.360]  for free speech just not alex jonesus zuckerberg is simply imitating successful deception tactics
[3:10:50.360 --> 3:10:57.800]  deployed by google and apple against the western world big tech's real agenda is global domination
[3:10:57.800 --> 3:11:05.560]  not just total surveillance of all information but control of all information using orwellian alchemy
[3:11:05.560 --> 3:11:13.160]  zuckerberg transforms himself from an enemy of free speech to its chief guardian he will decide
[3:11:13.160 --> 3:11:21.560]  what his speech and what isn't he will decide and if you violate those rules the ai is closely
[3:11:21.560 --> 3:11:28.440]  watching and will punish you authoritarian nations authoritarian countries authoritarian
[3:11:28.440 --> 3:11:35.560]  individuals are all in a race for hegemonic information control on this planet and communist
[3:11:35.560 --> 3:11:41.560]  china's attempt to flex its muscles by fully controlling hollywood and the nba has now caused
[3:11:41.560 --> 3:11:47.640]  a massive backlash so zuckerberg and others want to get out ahead of that so that they don't get
[3:11:47.640 --> 3:11:55.160]  connected to it and then congress stays asleep and never does anything while they quietly take over
[3:11:55.160 --> 3:12:01.240]  the planet and destroy all of our basic liberties and freedoms that are the true protections on
[3:12:01.240 --> 3:12:07.880]  civilization and are the systems and societies that created an atmosphere of openness and freedom
[3:12:07.880 --> 3:12:16.440]  that allowed institutions like google apple and twitter to grow up the truth is big tech has been
[3:12:16.440 --> 3:12:21.800]  surveilling us big tech has been consolidating the economy big tech has been censoring us for a
[3:12:21.800 --> 3:12:29.000]  long time and the systems that they've developed are antithetical to free societies they know that
[3:12:29.000 --> 3:12:34.840]  the people value their basic freedoms they know that basic freedoms are what make populist movements
[3:12:34.840 --> 3:12:43.400]  strong but that basic freedom stands in the way of a global corporate dominance and the ceos
[3:12:43.400 --> 3:12:49.400]  that captain these systems have combined forces against humanity and believe that they can defeat
[3:12:49.400 --> 3:12:56.600]  us but if we're simply aware of the facts and speak up and use our consumer power to say no to
[3:12:56.600 --> 3:13:02.680]  these institutions we can take control of these organizations for the betterment of humanity
[3:13:02.680 --> 3:13:08.520]  but the first step is admitting that this is indeed happening and that these organizations are
[3:13:08.520 --> 3:13:15.560]  authoritarian and are dangerous the truth is the people have all the power that's why these
[3:13:15.560 --> 3:13:20.440]  companies are trying to control information and are trying to censor to begin with so even though
[3:13:20.440 --> 3:13:27.720]  things look dark at times we are getting into very very good waters because people understand
[3:13:27.720 --> 3:13:33.960]  the fundamentals that are happening and are beginning to awaken but this process is going
[3:13:33.960 --> 3:13:41.720]  to take time mark zuckerberg isn't our enemy mark zuckerberg is really just a tool of a larger
[3:13:41.720 --> 3:13:48.600]  agenda and a system that we need to stand up to if we don't the globalists the technocrats will
[3:13:48.600 --> 3:13:55.720]  not respect us and we won't respect ourselves it's our world so let's start acting like it belongs
[3:13:55.720 --> 3:14:25.640]  to us let's start acting like shareholders we are in an information war our objective
[3:14:26.200 --> 3:14:33.080]  is to destroy the false narrative by reminding as many people as possible to think for themselves
[3:14:33.080 --> 3:14:40.360]  and question everything we were effective and so they tried to destroy us alex jones' youtube
[3:14:40.360 --> 3:14:46.200]  channel posted a video uh that was seen by 2.3 million subscribers alex jones obviously
[3:14:46.200 --> 3:14:52.600]  is a well known conspiracy theorist whose brand is bullying this stuff is not speech it's incitement
[3:14:52.600 --> 3:15:00.680]  harassment defamation this is a real-time example of when we talk about this information being
[3:15:00.680 --> 3:15:08.760]  weaponized we survived but we were wounded apple facebook spotify vimeo youtube twitter all of

[3:20:55.400 --> 3:21:00.760]  missing but that's what you get on alex jones and of course what we do with the trends journal
[3:21:00.760 --> 3:21:08.200]  i want to talk a little bit as we begin about this whole thing going on with siri and the curds
[3:21:09.400 --> 3:21:15.960]  let's get this straight it's a lot of bs that we're fighting them islamic terrorists over there
[3:21:15.960 --> 3:21:24.360]  and that's why we need the coins the Nobel peace of craft prize winner along with the lady hawks
[3:21:24.360 --> 3:21:37.000]  samantha power and susan rice and obama we got to get that guy a shot at it i don't like him i want
[3:21:37.000 --> 3:21:47.080]  him gone that's it all this is about this isis story it made this isis stuff up in 2014 when
[3:21:47.080 --> 3:21:57.000]  obama the arrogant lying Nobel peace of craft prize winner we got to get saved in the zitties
[3:21:57.000 --> 3:22:04.680]  over there in iraq you know it was isis is getting them like everybody knows what a zitty is there
[3:22:04.680 --> 3:22:11.560]  they're like yemmins and curds and ways most americans don't have a clue again isis is there
[3:22:11.560 --> 3:22:18.120]  because of the murderous people like the bill clinton that was bombing a rock every time he
[3:22:18.120 --> 3:22:29.160]  get caught with his pants down or whatever dirty deal he was doing yeah destroyed the place you
[3:22:29.160 --> 3:22:35.400]  forgot those no fly zones didn't you yeah don't forget to keep you fly up in a no fly zone
[3:22:35.400 --> 3:22:41.720]  and at bernie sanders who supported the murder and the sanctions of over 500 000 iraqi children
[3:22:41.720 --> 3:22:48.440]  under the age of five dying oh i wonder why they're quote terrorist groups can't figure out why they
[3:22:48.440 --> 3:22:53.320]  don't like us and then the murder of george bush going in there and all the other liars
[3:22:53.800 --> 3:23:03.480]  that lied us into that war we've killed over a million iraqis destroyed the country and then
[3:23:03.480 --> 3:23:11.480]  the other murderers along with the arab little league saudi's and others we got to get rid of
[3:23:11.480 --> 3:23:20.680]  that guy kadafi let's get rid of kadafi oh yeah well hire the al-qaeda and other bandits to do it
[3:23:21.400 --> 3:23:27.560]  and then after they did that they sent them into syria but that's only the history of that so let's
[3:23:27.560 --> 3:23:36.040]  we're there to save the people in the united states from those islamic terrorists the terrorist
[3:23:36.040 --> 3:23:42.360]  groups are formed by the united states actions and supported by the united states people forget
[3:23:42.360 --> 3:23:49.400]  that half a billion dollars of our money that that lowlife obama stole from us like they all do
[3:23:50.120 --> 3:23:56.200]  and gave them to those other uh remember that syrian force that was gonna get rid of a sod
[3:23:56.200 --> 3:24:05.320]  and those uh isices yeah and then they have given them al-qaeda and the others our weaponry and money
[3:24:06.920 --> 3:24:12.680]  so this whole thing about the Kurds oh our allies the Kurds they've been fighting this
[3:24:12.680 --> 3:24:20.600]  stuff with turkey and syria for their portions the land over there for how long that's all this
[3:24:20.600 --> 3:24:27.720]  is there's nothing to do with isis but that's the lie and that's what the people report the
[3:24:27.720 --> 3:24:36.920]  prostitutes report people all these liberals all around me would stop new york is only 15
[3:24:36.920 --> 3:24:42.680]  minutes away from kingston and i'm here from everybody oh isn't it terrible that we would
[3:24:42.680 --> 3:24:50.840]  be ending the Kurds these are words spewing out of the mouths of these little gutless liberals
[3:24:51.560 --> 3:25:00.760]  could you imagine if it was reversed and obama obama was taking the troops out
[3:25:02.520 --> 3:25:11.080]  oh we have no business being there this is an illegal war the united states has no right
[3:25:11.080 --> 3:25:18.680]  being in syria it's in violation of international law this is a sovereign nation that did nothing
[3:25:18.680 --> 3:25:25.880]  to us oh we might not like the way it's run there but it's none of our business we should
[3:25:25.880 --> 3:25:32.680]  not be involved in these foreign entanglements that's what they'd be saying but they're gutless
[3:25:32.680 --> 3:25:39.000]  little lowlife creatures so they keep spewing out the lines that are being spewed out there
[3:25:39.000 --> 3:25:46.920]  there they're comparing the new york times the toilet paper of record one after another
[3:25:46.920 --> 3:25:58.040]  are comparing the withdrawal of a thousand troops to america's withdrawal of saigon in vietnam
[3:25:58.040 --> 3:26:10.200]  what imbecile could make a comparison like this what stupid moronic lowlife scum sucking
[3:26:10.760 --> 3:26:19.000]  jerk would do something like that the mainstream media that's who and everybody buys it oh yeah
[3:26:19.000 --> 3:26:25.240]  the vietnam war how dare we leave saigon because now we're doing a lot of business with him it's
[3:26:25.240 --> 3:26:32.440]  okay now them commies are okay we just increased our buying stuff from vietnam importing it from
[3:26:32.440 --> 3:26:42.200]  their 31 percent last year another war based on lies the gulf of tonkin incident never happened
[3:26:43.080 --> 3:26:48.440]  oh well we gotta stop them commies them dominos are going to keep falling before you know it
[3:26:48.440 --> 3:26:55.720]  they'll be falling on the shores of california not making that up these are the sick people these are

[3:27:10.360 --> 3:27:21.400]  we should have been in vietnam we only murdered about four million people there killed 58 000
[3:27:21.400 --> 3:27:36.200]  of our soldiers some 300 000 wounded and millions still mentally upset by it and they're comparing
[3:27:36.200 --> 3:27:43.160]  it to saigon another war based on lies in a country had no business being with but again
[3:27:43.960 --> 3:27:50.920]  to flip the coin and look at the other side trump then what did he do he sends 3000 troops
[3:27:51.560 --> 3:28:00.360]  into saudi arabia that dictatorship oh yeah the saudi gang invented in 1934 they've
[3:28:00.360 --> 3:28:07.160]  fighting the yemenis since then the houthis and where are the troops they're not coming home

[3:31:22.360 --> 3:31:28.680]  but the preglonone kicks in in about a week or so folks look into preglonone for yourself

[3:32:09.000 --> 3:32:15.080]  or in the movies for many years and now they own our debt now they own the democratic party now
[3:32:15.080 --> 3:32:20.600]  they've merged with silicon valley to censor patriots off the air washington post comes out
[3:32:20.600 --> 3:32:25.480]  and says they hope that gg ping the dictator of china will quote destroy trump that's a headline
[3:32:26.280 --> 3:32:32.840]  so infowars has been the paul revere of this operation we have blown the whistle continuously
[3:32:32.840 --> 3:32:37.320]  and have been proven right and that's why it's more important than ever that we override silicon
[3:32:37.320 --> 3:32:41.880]  valley and their chai kong masters by word of mouth and spread the word about infowars

[3:35:28.600 --> 3:35:35.880]  because that's all this is it's a presidential reality show quote if we think there is a
[3:35:35.880 --> 3:35:43.480]  commitment a treaty or a deal that we can improve on we go to the table and we make it happen and
[3:35:43.480 --> 3:35:53.880]  the mayor said what empty garbage stupid presidential reality show bs of course we'll

[3:38:04.200 --> 3:38:05.960]  trumps here we go
[3:38:05.960 --> 3:38:16.600]  he also dismissed the notion of completely removing us military from the middle east
[3:38:17.240 --> 3:38:22.360]  he completely dismissed it we have no right being there
[3:38:25.080 --> 3:38:25.800]  you got it
[3:38:25.800 --> 3:38:33.080]  we have no right being there

[3:39:28.040 --> 3:39:34.680]  you arrogant arrogant person telling us we should stay in the middle east
[3:39:37.880 --> 3:39:39.880]  and you know why we need to be in the middle east
[3:39:39.880 --> 3:39:47.960]  we need to keep american people safe when it comes to the middle east yes it will be messy
[3:39:49.320 --> 3:39:58.280]  for probably as long as i'm alive well maybe you should pass on real quick get a land huh
[3:40:00.280 --> 3:40:07.960]  as long as you're alive all this is is the tenth crusade get it in your head everybody
[3:40:07.960 --> 3:40:15.560]  the united states never had any business being there this is the tenth crusade what goes on
[3:40:15.560 --> 3:40:24.360]  over there should stay there if you came to my country and killed everybody that i love and
[3:40:24.360 --> 3:40:30.920]  destroyed my place would i want to get even with you oh you would call me an italian american
[3:40:30.920 --> 3:40:39.320]  fundamentalist wanting to get even with you pay back sabich
[3:40:41.880 --> 3:40:48.360]  but destroying everything that i loved and have no future like the united states
[3:40:48.360 --> 3:41:01.160]  and its coalition of the killing is done in the middle east iraq libya syria yemen
[3:41:01.960 --> 3:41:07.800]  and then of course there's israel taking more and more land and calling its settlements
[3:41:09.320 --> 3:41:14.680]  like you know it's like the wild west your happy trails to you and the wagon trains going down
[3:41:14.680 --> 3:41:19.880]  the empty places where nobody was except the indians of course but they were only locals
[3:41:21.000 --> 3:41:28.280]  settlements america has no right in any of this and it's all beginning to explode big time
[3:41:29.880 --> 3:41:33.560]  so let me see what this little little time man has to say
[3:41:37.320 --> 3:41:44.440]  what president trump does is wake up in the morning and have a phone call or maybe a tweet
[3:41:44.440 --> 3:41:53.400]  and completely change years or even decades of us policy surprising his own generals and the
[3:41:53.400 --> 3:42:07.880]  country in a process hey what decades of us policy are you talking about budigieg obama's wars
[3:42:07.880 --> 3:42:22.440]  clinton's wars bush's wars this isn't policy it's madness oh and the generals yeah generally
[3:42:22.440 --> 3:42:30.440]  haven't won anything like that guy matters shooting off his mouth going after trump and talking about
[3:42:30.440 --> 3:42:40.440]  what success haven't had one jack show me one or shut your mouth because i've had enough occupied
[3:42:40.440 --> 3:42:50.600]  peace w w w occupied peace let's get these mad men out of our life and out of war and bring joy
[3:42:50.600 --> 3:42:57.240]  beauty liberty and love back to america and we'll be back in just a few and remember support
[3:42:57.240 --> 3:43:01.960]  info wars put your money where your heart is i've got to really hand it to the listeners
[3:43:01.960 --> 3:43:08.680]  and viewers from info wars your support and your help in rebooting americana is a challenge to the
[3:43:08.680 --> 3:43:14.280]  globalist system of corporate tyranny has really caught hold not just here in the u.s. worldwide
[3:43:14.280 --> 3:43:20.840]  and president trump's fearlessness when it comes to promoting americana and basic liberty is amazing
[3:43:20.840 --> 3:43:26.360]  as well you're still lacking on the big tech censorship taking action against that in some
[3:43:26.360 --> 3:43:31.000]  other areas but trying to end the wars boosting our economy speaking out against communist china
[3:43:31.560 --> 3:43:36.440]  trump's been doing an amazing job but now more than ever we really have to realize that
[3:43:37.160 --> 3:43:43.000]  we're being targeted because we are effective and the globalists are beginning to lose their war
[3:43:43.720 --> 3:43:47.640]  against humanity in a big way and so we're going to see some major fireworks out of them
[3:43:47.640 --> 3:43:53.480]  but it's critical to not let ourselves get down when we see all the poison they spray at us
[3:43:53.480 --> 3:43:58.680]  that's an attempt to demoralize us we've got to remember that and stay focused and stay happy

[3:49:51.240 --> 3:49:57.240]  on to the news you get yesterday's news tomorrow we give you tomorrow's news today so we're putting
[3:49:57.240 --> 3:50:02.840]  it together for example it's going on over there in catalan with the massive protests
[3:50:02.840 --> 3:50:09.080]  that's going on there in hong kong as the protests get more and more violent and it we just put those
[3:50:09.080 --> 3:50:14.840]  two together how the governments are cracking down on the people and robbing them of more freedoms
[3:50:15.560 --> 3:50:21.880]  and then you take a look what went on in chile just this past weekend state of emergency chile
[3:50:21.880 --> 3:50:31.320]  chile just came out of the news at a nowhere ecuador last week the week before Peru
[3:50:33.080 --> 3:50:44.680]  all over the world destabilization Lebanon blew up one day one place after another angola

[3:51:04.040 --> 3:51:09.880]  this is a fight against poverty and the one percent getting everything this is a fight
[3:51:09.880 --> 3:51:16.280]  against corruption that runs a government near you all these governments are corrupt
[3:51:16.840 --> 3:51:23.880]  the united states corruptness right at the top look at it morons and imbeciles call them

[3:51:34.520 --> 3:51:45.560]  this opiate crisis look how big farm is taken over big ag big everything or we become a plantation
[3:51:45.560 --> 3:51:53.400]  workers on the global plantation of slave landia all the money's gone to the one percent i'm not
[3:51:53.400 --> 3:52:07.960]  making that up you know the facts markets going up yeah golden sacks is worried that
[3:52:10.520 --> 3:52:19.000]  stock buybacks are going down share repurchases have been a key element during this bull market
[3:52:19.000 --> 3:52:25.400]  it which is currently the longest on record by repurchasing shares the company reduces the
[3:52:25.400 --> 3:52:32.120]  number of shares outstanding it can have the effect of boosting the stock price and also
[3:52:32.120 --> 3:52:42.520]  lifts earnings per share figure you got it it's a rig game today just today
[3:52:42.520 --> 3:52:55.240]  today this morning but the federal reserve pumped in over 50 billion dollars into the overnight
[3:52:55.240 --> 3:53:01.640]  repo markets this is quantitative easing forever
[3:53:01.640 --> 3:53:12.360]  five they've already the new york federal reserve injected a hundred and four point
[3:53:12.360 --> 3:53:16.840]  one five billion dollars into the repo markets
[3:53:20.680 --> 3:53:27.000]  in one day last week the feds now going to repurchase

[3:53:36.840 --> 3:53:43.560]  not calling it that they're calling it something else you know what they're calling it i can't say
[3:53:44.200 --> 3:53:50.280]  but it begins with a b and ends with an s and it's two words and it comes from a ball
[3:53:50.280 --> 3:53:57.080]  ball and that's all the bull is the war street bull is an addicted addict
[3:53:59.160 --> 3:54:05.080]  and it keeps shoving more and more monetary methadone into them i just read you gorman sacks
[3:54:05.080 --> 3:54:10.600]  they're concerned that stock buybacks won't artificially prep up the market so the one
[3:54:10.600 --> 3:54:19.880]  percent could get richer every day giving the gamblers more more money as the repo
[3:54:19.880 --> 3:54:27.640]  markets are their injections to the gamblers to keep gambling hey you know that guy raid dalio
