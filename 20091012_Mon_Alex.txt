[00:00.000 --> 00:11.560]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well

[00:19.080 --> 00:39.640]  Texas Alex Jones it is Monday the 12th day of October 2009 we're gonna be live
[00:39.640 --> 00:47.120]  here for the next four hours extremely important revealing broadcast more and
[00:47.120 --> 00:49.880]  more I come on air at the start of the broadcast and say that everything is
[00:49.880 --> 00:53.720]  falling into place the world government is openly being announced and it is
[00:53.720 --> 01:00.520]  extremely crystal-clear what we're facing as a society and as a species there
[01:00.520 --> 01:05.120]  is no longer any doubts we were absolutely right about our analysis of
[01:05.120 --> 01:09.600]  the last 14 years of what we were facing in fact it is far worse than I
[01:09.600 --> 01:15.400]  even imagined early on though I've read thousands of government documents and
[01:15.400 --> 01:21.760]  pieces of legislation think tank policy reports to be living the new world order
[01:21.760 --> 01:31.080]  to now be inside of it and sinking deeper into it braces me it it chills me
[01:31.080 --> 01:43.840]  yet it shakes me to my very core love is the answer to this evil countering
[01:43.840 --> 01:52.720]  this wickedness with love and with perseverance and with honor and with
[01:52.720 --> 02:01.320]  courage is the only course we have I'm gonna be quite reflective in this first
[02:01.320 --> 02:05.480]  hour I'm gonna try to cover a lot of news but also make some important points
[02:05.480 --> 02:11.920]  as I had a few days this weekend with my family taking off to really reflect on
[02:11.920 --> 02:16.880]  the state of the world and not just the state of the world but the state of the
[02:16.880 --> 02:22.840]  liberty movement and the state of this radio show the good the bad and the
[02:22.840 --> 02:31.960]  ugly let me tell you about some of the guests we had today you know we had
[02:31.960 --> 02:35.800]  David icon last Wednesday for 30 minutes he'll be on with us for an hour
[02:35.800 --> 02:45.080]  today then we have a another guest joining us the author of defeating the
[02:45.080 --> 02:52.920]  totalitarian lie a former Hitler youth warns America this gentleman will be
[02:52.920 --> 03:01.400]  joining us coming up later in the broadcast as well and we're going to
[03:01.400 --> 03:12.320]  have open phones there have been at least five big hit pieces and I haven't
[03:12.320 --> 03:16.000]  even been looking for them so there's probably more that I've seen the last
[03:16.000 --> 03:27.960]  two days against me the new republic media matters salon and others there is
[03:27.960 --> 03:32.800]  no doubt I'm on the White House enemies list that's been reported even the
[03:32.800 --> 03:38.360]  Associated Press was reported there is a White House enemies list and it doesn't
[03:38.360 --> 03:53.440]  scare me it makes me sad and I am ready and willing and honored and blessed in
[03:53.440 --> 04:02.560]  whatever persecution and disinformation campaigns I have to go through but I am
[04:02.560 --> 04:06.840]  sad that the establishment the social engineers can find so many willing
[04:06.840 --> 04:18.040]  people who are so blind or so given over to evil that they revel and enjoy
[04:18.040 --> 04:25.600]  attacking myself and others who are simply trying to defend our little sad
[04:25.600 --> 04:36.400]  but also great species I've never claimed to be up to the challenge of
[04:36.400 --> 04:40.880]  fighting the new world order by myself I've never claimed that I'm not in over
[04:40.880 --> 04:49.760]  my head but as a species we're all in over our heads right now including the
[04:49.760 --> 04:55.680]  establishment is playing at God I say playing because they're not in control

[08:02.200 --> 08:07.000]  McAleer directed a documentary called not evil just wrong which challenged
[08:07.000 --> 08:11.520]  Al Gore's movie and inconvenient truth McAleer was more than happy to take
[08:11.520 --> 08:15.720]  advantage of the opportunity to ask or about his movie a judge in the British
[08:15.720 --> 08:19.240]  High Court after a lengthy hearing found there were nine significant errors
[08:19.240 --> 08:22.920]  this has been shown to children have you do accept those findings and have you
[08:22.920 --> 08:27.960]  done anything to correct those errors well I'm not going to go through all of
[08:27.960 --> 08:33.000]  those the ruling was in favor of the movie by the way and the ruling was in
[08:33.000 --> 08:39.440]  favor of showing the movie in schools and that that's that's really the bottom
[08:39.440 --> 08:45.240]  line on that there's been such a long discussion of each one of those specific
[08:45.240 --> 08:50.160]  things one I'm for example was it polar bears if I remember correctly it's been
[08:50.160 --> 08:53.760]  a long time ago that polar bears really aren't endangered well polar bears didn't
[08:53.760 --> 09:00.880]  get that word so well the number of polar bears have increased actually and
[09:00.880 --> 09:03.800]  are increasing you don't think they're endangered do you the number of polar
[09:03.800 --> 09:07.440]  bears have increased you think they're endangered the number of polar bears
[09:07.440 --> 09:12.080]  have increased I mean all right if the number of polar bears increase surely
[09:12.080 --> 09:15.960]  they're not an agent for the word for a judge judge we have to move on no but
[09:15.960 --> 09:20.240]  no I mean vice president go out vice president go or hasn't vice vice
[09:20.240 --> 09:23.720]  president hot we're not doing a debate here no this is a question I hasn't
[09:23.720 --> 09:27.360]  answered the question we have ten minutes left for these people I would
[09:27.360 --> 09:33.920]  appreciate his answer to the court after organizers cut knackle there's my
[09:33.920 --> 09:41.120]  they then followed him outside and gotten his face for daring the question
[09:41.120 --> 09:46.480]  their religion of eugenics their religion of taking over the planet
[09:46.480 --> 09:51.920]  archaeologists and biologists that have studied the history and the fossil
[09:51.920 --> 09:55.560]  record of polar bears show that during warming periods their numbers actually
[09:55.560 --> 10:00.000]  increase just in North America alone they've gone from around 35,000 to over
[10:00.000 --> 10:06.440]  45,000 in just the last decade and there's that many again in Europe
[10:06.440 --> 10:13.160]  northern Europe into areas of northern Russia and now that the earth has been
[10:13.160 --> 10:24.000]  cooling in the last 11 years even the BBC has that headline today even the
[10:24.000 --> 10:29.560]  drudge report today has a huge list of links at the top with the BBC and other
[10:29.560 --> 10:33.440]  mainstream publications going well whatever happened to global warming and
[10:33.440 --> 10:38.360]  admitting that the earth has not been warming for 11 years and is now rapidly
[10:38.360 --> 10:47.760]  cooling all because the Sun has gone into a dormant cycle it is in the last
[10:47.760 --> 10:51.160]  300 years of its heat radiance being measured it's one of the first things to
[10:51.160 --> 10:57.680]  be accurately scientifically measured this is the lowest ebb in the sunspots
[10:57.680 --> 11:03.760]  no sunspots in the last year back scientists are getting a little worried
[11:03.760 --> 11:11.000]  and I'll assure you your SUVs are not causing Mars to cool the moons of Saturn
[11:11.000 --> 11:15.520]  and Jupiter to cool they're not causing the moon to cool and they're not causing
[11:15.520 --> 11:22.000]  the earth to cool or heat it's all that giant Sun that you can fit over a
[11:22.000 --> 11:31.320]  million Earths into over one million Earths you can fit thousands and thousands
[11:31.320 --> 11:37.800]  of planet Earths in Jupiter Jupiter is heating they now have spectrometers and
[11:37.800 --> 11:43.200]  different devices on space probes and high-powered satellites that show this
[11:43.200 --> 11:49.880]  several moons of Saturn and Jupiter were melting they had been liquid they had
[11:49.880 --> 11:54.320]  been hard ice they're now turning to liquid and they're now refreezing again
[11:54.320 --> 12:01.400]  there had been a warming trend in the last 20 years that is starting about 20
[12:01.400 --> 12:10.200]  years ago ran for about 10 years we're now into a cooling cycle to be precise if
[12:10.200 --> 12:20.040]  you pull up the charts a cooling period began the last five years 20 years ago
[12:20.040 --> 12:27.400]  they're a heating period began it ran for about a decade then the heating
[12:27.400 --> 12:32.720]  stopped for five years and has since then been cooling for the last five and
[12:32.720 --> 12:38.640]  these are all public numbers the BBC has a big report out on it today the
[12:38.640 --> 12:46.320]  thermometers don't lie and the Sun doesn't lie record cold right now in many
[12:46.320 --> 12:51.000]  areas of the United States record temperatures record cold temperatures
[12:51.000 --> 12:56.720]  being reported in Montana in the last four days believe me I was there a week
[12:56.720 --> 13:05.520]  and a half ago and it was sleeting at night sleeting in early October in
[13:05.520 --> 13:11.720]  Montana and I was in Hardin down in the relatively low country not up on the
[13:11.720 --> 13:19.440]  snow-capped mountains 40 miles away but I belabor that issue we're gonna be
[13:19.440 --> 13:23.240]  getting more into it today coming up a little bit later in the show again
[13:23.240 --> 13:32.240]  David Ike is joining us on this live Monday October 12th 2009 edition when I
[13:32.240 --> 13:38.920]  talk about all the pieces of world government now coming crisply into view
[13:38.920 --> 13:44.360]  that is exactly what is happening Obama becoming the first sitting U.S.
[13:44.360 --> 13:49.280]  president or president period to be the chairman of the UN Security Council the
[13:49.280 --> 13:53.440]  true body that has all the power in the U.N.
[13:55.560 --> 14:01.840]  Obama being given the Nobel Peace Prize I can being given total control by the
[14:01.840 --> 14:04.720]  U.S. government and the private corporation and announcing it would
[14:04.720 --> 14:08.960]  give control to the U.N. over the Internet two weeks ago that's not
[14:08.960 --> 14:12.120]  happening by accident the announcement that they're planning to begin the
[14:12.120 --> 14:17.080]  process of scrapping the dollar as the world reserve currency and devaluing it
[14:17.080 --> 14:23.000]  that has all been announced the last two weeks everything is happening
[14:23.000 --> 14:31.080]  simultaneously they're also announcing a new global police force in the New York
[14:31.080 --> 14:37.280]  Times to be run by Interpol and backed up by NATO and the United Nations the
[14:37.280 --> 14:41.400]  U.S. Supreme Court has been announcing that it's going to be taking its orders
[14:41.400 --> 14:47.520]  from the Hague as the highest court in the world it's all happening
[14:47.520 --> 15:01.520]  simultaneously notice that California has passed laws to make biometric access
[15:01.520 --> 15:08.200]  key pads be placed on all new firearms produced in the state that tracker
[15:08.200 --> 15:12.840]  numbers be stamped into all ammunition sold in the state that will then cause
[15:12.840 --> 15:17.000]  adoption nationwide just as air conditioner automobile light bulb
[15:17.000 --> 15:21.360]  standards are all set in California this has been openly announced I have some
[15:21.360 --> 15:26.240]  bad news for everyone this out of news 10 ammunition bill signed in the law I
[15:26.240 --> 15:31.120]  told you Swartz and Edgar would sign it last week he lied and said he wasn't
[15:31.120 --> 15:35.120]  going to sign it he didn't support it that's a classic military tactic to
[15:35.120 --> 15:39.600]  deny he was going to sign it so that no opposition could be launched against it
[15:39.600 --> 15:44.960]  and then now they've signed it ammunition bill means you have to
[15:44.960 --> 15:51.040]  biometrically thumb print and scan and be registered to buy any ammo in the
[15:51.040 --> 15:54.520]  next legislative session they already have introduced legislation this
[15:54.520 --> 15:59.520]  session but it'll probably pass on the next to then make it a crime to even
[15:59.520 --> 16:04.000]  bring ammo in and then to own ammo even previously purchased and the state of
[16:04.000 --> 16:08.720]  California that's not registered you will then be SWAT teamed and rated over
[16:08.720 --> 16:14.360]  your quote arsenal of ammunition every day now I see reports from across the
[16:14.360 --> 16:20.800]  United States even in so-called pro-gun states like Vermont Texas and Arizona
[16:20.800 --> 16:25.400]  where people are rated neighbors will see generally it's almost always an old
[16:25.400 --> 16:31.440]  man or a veteran we've even seen a discovery channel piece called inside
[16:31.440 --> 16:37.480]  the LAPD where neighbors see you with firearms loading them in your car
[16:37.480 --> 16:42.640]  taking to the gunsmith of the shooting range or to go deer hunting or whatever
[16:42.640 --> 16:48.920]  the case may be and the police respond they SWAT team you the no crime has been
[16:48.920 --> 16:51.760]  committed they still go ahead and confiscate your firearms and ammo and
[16:51.760 --> 16:56.840]  most the time arrest you and take you in for psychological evaluation saying
[16:56.840 --> 17:04.400]  you're mentally ill because you believe you're being oppressed and so that
[17:04.400 --> 17:08.520]  ammunition bill has been signed into law in California Sacramento California
[17:08.520 --> 17:13.680]  before the midnight deadline governor Schwarzenegger acted on 685 bills that
[17:13.680 --> 17:18.960]  were on his desk he signed 456 and vetoed 229 one of the bills that he signed
[17:18.960 --> 17:24.200]  was assembly bill 962 it requires handgun ammunition to be kept behind the
[17:24.200 --> 17:27.960]  counter where customers cannot access it without assistance it also requires
[17:27.960 --> 17:33.240]  gun shop owners the thumbprint people who buy handgun ammunition as well as a
[17:33.240 --> 17:37.280]  record of their identification provided information to police it's God
[17:37.280 --> 17:40.800]  registration Schwarzenegger released a statement explaining why I signed the
[17:40.800 --> 17:46.280]  bill to the members of the California State Assembly I'm signing bill 962 the
[17:46.280 --> 17:51.080]  measure would require vendors of handgun ammunition and there's in every
[17:51.080 --> 17:56.880]  case a handgun type system that far 223 308 whatever and so under the bill
[17:56.880 --> 18:02.520]  basically all ammo was covered the measure would require vendors of handgun
[18:02.520 --> 18:05.680]  ammunition to keep a log of information hanging ammunition sales store
[18:05.680 --> 18:09.200]  ammunition in a safe and secure manner and require a face-to-face transfer
[18:09.200 --> 18:17.520]  ammunition sales and he did sign it as I told you he would because he's a liar
[18:17.520 --> 18:23.160]  and an anti-American piece of trash his father arrested people as an SS officer
[18:23.160 --> 18:30.440]  and took them to their deaths by the thousands he is an absolute monster but
[18:30.440 --> 18:38.400]  as his late mentor Kurt Volltime former head of the UN UN secretary general he
[18:38.400 --> 18:41.880]  follows in his footsteps and that's who the globalists like they like
[18:41.880 --> 18:46.160]  communists they like Nazis they like Marcus Wolf who advised Homeland
[18:46.160 --> 18:49.960]  Security on the setup of the Stasi forces here in the United States the
[18:49.960 --> 18:55.520]  former head of the Stasi that's who they like and that's who they work with and
[18:55.520 --> 19:01.160]  this is what they're doing this is what we face as a society now we get back I'm
[19:01.160 --> 19:06.240]  going to detail what we're facing in the latest open announcements of world
[19:06.240 --> 19:11.920]  government the internet being handed over to the United Nations the internet
[19:11.920 --> 19:17.000]  numbering system through ICANN the domain systems they openly announced they
[19:17.000 --> 19:20.960]  want to tax regulate shut down many domains the UN will decide if you can

[24:41.840 --> 24:46.800]  wish they weren't writing open government textbooks and policy reports

[25:05.160 --> 25:10.640]  I wish that when it was openly calmly announced like they were talking about a
[25:10.640 --> 25:18.760]  tire sale down the street at mr. Goodrench I wish that when they calmly
[25:18.760 --> 25:25.840]  reported oh from the Middle East to Africa from Asia to Latin America a

[25:47.480 --> 25:52.240]  White House and all the George Soros publications like media matters and
[25:52.240 --> 25:59.720]  think process that are attacking me don't you folks understand that you're in
[25:59.720 --> 26:05.160]  the crosshairs as well and this is a great abomination against our little
[26:05.160 --> 26:10.880]  species what's happening and then that the most vicious wicked disgusting
[26:10.880 --> 26:17.600]  people you can imagine are in control and are setting up a planetary
[26:17.600 --> 26:23.560]  dictatorship turning the entire globe into a giant torture dungeon so they
[26:23.560 --> 26:35.040]  can have our way with us so they can take us and tear us limb from limb what
[26:35.040 --> 26:41.920]  are we going to do about that we the people of this planet 99.9% of us are
[26:41.920 --> 26:45.960]  in the crosshairs we are inside the world government but it is gone from an
[26:45.960 --> 26:56.640]  embryonic phase to now being up on its feet and being operational and I look
[26:56.640 --> 27:01.040]  at the admitted crimes I look at daily the hundreds and hundreds of horrible
[27:01.040 --> 27:04.840]  things the establishment admits they're doing and how they're setting the
[27:04.840 --> 27:09.680]  precedent to just lie out on the open and to carry out crimes out on the open
[27:09.680 --> 27:16.720]  and to always push forward and always expand what they're doing it's sickening
[27:16.720 --> 27:37.440]  and then I see this article written for info wars dot com titled the real
[27:37.440 --> 27:47.720]  sicko movie by Adam Murdoch indeed and I don't even want to cover it on air it's
[27:47.720 --> 27:56.160]  just so outrageous so in our face and I know it's only the beginning of the
[27:56.160 --> 28:11.800]  crimes against humanity the bloodlust the blood thirst that the degenerates of
[28:11.800 --> 28:19.560]  the new world order are carrying out against this sweet species homo sapiens
[28:19.560 --> 28:27.160]  that has so many hopes and so many dreams and so many things that we could
[28:27.160 --> 28:34.080]  be doing as a people that has so much potential and to see our world hijack
[28:34.080 --> 28:45.800]  and run by these globalist it's just very sad more and more my rage and my
[28:45.800 --> 28:55.560]  anger at this coterie this society this league of evil my anger just gives way
[28:55.560 --> 29:03.680]  to intense sadness and intense discernment and the more I learn and the
[29:03.680 --> 29:13.160]  more I understand I just can't believe it I do I marvel at the beast I marvel
[29:13.160 --> 29:22.640]  to a point of speechlessness of fathomless cold and in my mind I can hold
[29:22.640 --> 29:27.200]  the image of all that is good and beautiful and wholesome and innocent
[29:27.200 --> 29:39.680]  those islands of goodliness versus the great ghosts of pain and suffering and

[33:38.560 --> 33:49.120]  their new chief enemy yes they are declaring me to be their chief enemy
[33:49.120 --> 34:05.040]  and there was a time there are still our times when my ego my bravada says
[34:05.040 --> 34:09.880]  great means you're doing your job John Hancock I want to be on all the list and
[34:09.880 --> 34:17.560]  at the top of the list and there is an intellectual satisfaction in knowing
[34:17.560 --> 34:25.200]  that in my life I've stood up for what's good haven't been perfect but it's
[34:25.200 --> 34:29.840]  another testament to what humanity can do when we stand up it's just a little
[34:29.840 --> 34:40.320]  old Alex Jones warts and all can stand up to the global technocratic empire it
[34:40.320 --> 34:44.560]  is a testament to what all of you as individuals black white Hispanic old
[34:44.560 --> 34:50.440]  young German Jew Chinese it doesn't matter what all of you can do as
[34:50.440 --> 34:56.600]  humanity if you study the enemy's own documents their own white papers
[34:56.600 --> 35:01.880]  understand their larger plan and blow the trumpet and warn the people we know
[35:01.880 --> 35:06.680]  their program we know their plan we know their operations and that is half the
[35:06.680 --> 35:13.760]  battle it's an old army motto knowing who your enemy is and what they're
[35:13.760 --> 35:21.200]  planning is half the battle the other half the battle is facing your enemy and
[35:21.200 --> 35:26.120]  I want it to be said only because if I am crushed or killed or set up or
[35:26.120 --> 35:33.560]  destroyed I want it to be said that that was my choice and that that itself is a
[35:33.560 --> 35:39.480]  victory I don't think that's coming anytime soon though I do approach that
[35:39.480 --> 35:47.280]  place in my life every day it is that unknown country because by arriving at
[35:47.280 --> 35:57.320]  that island of great pain and great personal persecution and suffering by
[35:57.320 --> 36:04.640]  willingly sailing to that island we also find the keys to the gate to free
[36:04.640 --> 36:10.560]  the captives and all of us as humans were born and forged in our mother's
[36:10.560 --> 36:15.760]  wombs where God knew us before we were even formed in our mother's wombs we
[36:15.760 --> 36:22.560]  were all made to stand up and to love the species and to love God's creations
[36:22.560 --> 36:33.680]  and to be good people and to be tested but the fact that I am being attacked
[36:33.680 --> 36:39.920]  from below and above and from all sides north south east and west and all
[36:39.920 --> 36:47.200]  different deceptions and devices of the enemy is the true seal the true
[36:47.200 --> 36:56.960]  certification of our bona fide authenticity but I challenge all of you
[36:56.960 --> 37:04.120]  out there to remember that each and every one of you has great individual
[37:04.120 --> 37:11.680]  power and that we as a species are great builders we are truly made in the
[37:11.680 --> 37:19.640]  image of the Creator the Creator of all that is and ever was and that is written
[37:19.640 --> 37:28.960]  on our soul the wicked manifest a counterfeit because they hate all that
[37:28.960 --> 37:32.760]  is good and wholesome because what is good and wholesome gives us liberty and
[37:32.760 --> 37:39.960]  freedom and does not allow them to play God they create a wicked dark
[37:39.960 --> 37:53.280]  destructive counterfeit that takes everything good and reverses it and
[37:53.280 --> 37:58.080]  they're very good at sugarcoating their poison to make it look like it's
[37:58.080 --> 38:04.720]  humanitarian that it's altruistic that it's humanitarian that it's philanthropy
[38:04.720 --> 38:12.680]  and the good people of the world have a blind spot for that they don't spend the
[38:12.680 --> 38:24.600]  time to drill down into the facts of the matter and discover the reality for
[38:24.600 --> 38:48.320]  themselves you know in the past I would laugh at these hit pieces
[38:48.800 --> 38:53.400]  and that pieces would come once a week or once a month now they come multiple
[38:53.400 --> 39:02.240]  times a day but I read them now and I do feel sadness for the people that write
[39:02.240 --> 39:10.120]  them in the the establishment that orders them because I know where all of
[39:10.120 --> 39:23.280]  this leads and it does not lead to a happy or nice place I have seen through
[39:23.280 --> 39:29.760]  history and I have seen through studying our present and future trajectory
[39:29.760 --> 39:40.720]  that where we're going is a hellish tyranny that
[39:40.720 --> 40:01.400]  beholding it changes my very soul to know what's going to happen to know
[40:01.400 --> 40:05.320]  they're going to kill not millions not hundreds of millions but billions of
[40:05.320 --> 40:15.760]  people and to know that they're going to carry it out and the public is so under
[40:15.760 --> 40:22.000]  a trance and so deeply and graciated in mind control that is the ambient soft
[40:22.000 --> 40:33.920]  kill purges expand and grow and blossom with their sickening fruit that the
[40:33.920 --> 40:45.480]  poor public won't even be able to recognize their destruction all right
[40:45.480 --> 40:50.320]  here are some of the stacks of news Obama and Nobel Prize when war becomes
[40:50.320 --> 40:57.000]  peace when the lie becomes the truth when war becomes peace when concepts and
[40:57.000 --> 41:01.000]  realities are turned upside down when fiction becomes truth and truth becomes
[41:01.000 --> 41:06.000]  fiction when a global military agenda is heralded as humanitarian endeavor when
[41:06.000 --> 41:10.600]  the killing of civilians is upheld is collateral damage when those who resist
[41:10.600 --> 41:14.280]  the u.s. NATO led invasion of their homeland or categorizes insurgents and
[41:14.280 --> 41:21.480]  terrorists when preemptive nuclear war is upheld as self-defense when advanced
[41:21.480 --> 41:24.800]  torture and interrogation techniques are routinely used to protect peacekeeping
[41:24.800 --> 41:28.640]  operations when tactical nuclear weapons are heralded as a Pentagon is
[41:28.640 --> 41:32.560]  harmless to the surrounding civilian population when three-quarters of the
[41:32.560 --> 41:38.040]  u.s. personnel and personal federal income tax revenues are allocated to
[41:38.040 --> 41:43.760]  financing what is euphemistically referred to as national defense when the
[41:43.760 --> 41:48.680]  commander-in-chief of the largest military force on the planet is presented
[41:48.680 --> 41:55.280]  as a global peacemaker when the lie becomes the truth that is what we face
[41:55.280 --> 41:58.760]  and that's the article at lou rockwell.com we have linked up one prison
[41:58.760 --> 42:10.400]  planet.com I'm Michelle Chassadowski and it says it well it's just pure lies and to
[42:10.400 --> 42:17.520]  watch conscious liars in the media on the fake left and the confake right part
[42:17.520 --> 42:22.960]  of the control limited paradigm sit there attacking those of us that point out
[42:22.960 --> 42:30.720]  that the emperor has no clothes it's a sick joke and it makes you really worry
[42:30.720 --> 42:39.400]  about humanity's sanity and it makes you wonder how these liars knowingly sit up
[42:39.400 --> 42:45.760]  there and deceive people and get off on deceiving people that'd be like watching
[42:45.760 --> 42:49.320]  a four-year-old or five-year-old get on a bicycle for the first time across the
[42:49.320 --> 42:53.640]  street as your neighbor sits there and guides their son or daughter down the
[42:53.640 --> 42:58.560]  sidewalk and watching them fall and skin their knees and then laughing and
[42:58.560 --> 43:03.080]  enjoying them falling down and hoping they fall and break their jaw or knock
[43:03.080 --> 43:08.880]  their teeth out or break an arm I mean that's the way to describe this to watch
[43:08.880 --> 43:12.320]  the social engineers write white papers and brag how they're breaking up the
[43:12.320 --> 43:15.480]  family and how they're gonna have year-round schooling and how they're
[43:15.480 --> 43:18.920]  gonna take basically everybody's children and break up the family and dump
[43:18.920 --> 43:24.320]  everyone down and add chemicals to retard the public's brains their intellects
[43:24.320 --> 43:29.080]  in the vaccines in the water in the food to watch the establishment celebrate
[43:29.080 --> 43:34.640]  and giggle and smirk about it to watch them persecute innocent families and
[43:34.640 --> 43:38.600]  take their children as the parents and children cry and to watch the police and
[43:38.600 --> 43:47.800]  social workers eyes burn with a demonic glow of enjoyment I've seen it all but I
[43:47.800 --> 43:52.440]  know I've seen little I think I've seen it all I think I've seen the limits of
[43:52.440 --> 43:57.680]  what I can take and I know it's only the beginning of this big banquet laid out
[43:57.680 --> 44:03.600]  before the establishment where they can rend and tear and corner the innocent
[44:05.840 --> 44:13.880]  I've seen articles in the times of London and in LaFigaro going back over a
[44:13.880 --> 44:20.360]  decade I first began to see the articles in 98-99 one article in the times of
[44:20.360 --> 44:25.520]  London one tiny window into all of this is the establishment through it in
[44:25.520 --> 44:28.120]  everyone's face
[44:31.240 --> 44:42.680]  describe a beautiful woman a once beautiful woman weighing 87 pounds I
[44:42.680 --> 44:51.680]  believe the article said I remember it was 80 pounds and change escaped in
[44:51.680 --> 45:00.320]  burgundy France she came to the local regional police office wearing nothing
[45:00.320 --> 45:05.600]  but a trash bag around her waist that she dug out of a garbage can and she
[45:05.600 --> 45:10.160]  came in they described her like a zombie most of her hair falling out
[45:10.160 --> 45:17.720]  cuts and burns all over her body and she screamed and begged for help and the
[45:17.720 --> 45:27.680]  police attempted to go to the Rothschild own castle they own scores of
[45:27.680 --> 45:35.280]  vineyards and estates and castles and chalets and when they got there they
[45:35.280 --> 45:41.880]  found other women in cages and then dead bodies as well buried of women the taste
[45:41.880 --> 45:45.120]  of this castle was women
[45:49.960 --> 45:57.480]  and then no one was prosecuted no one got in trouble the arts minister in
[45:57.480 --> 46:01.360]  France one of the most important positions it's rated in the French news
[46:01.360 --> 46:09.160]  is the third most important position only behind defense and finance a
[46:09.160 --> 46:14.160]  relative of the late French president Francois Mitterrand an admitted
[46:14.160 --> 46:21.000]  Luciferian who designed the 666 gold pieces gold glass for the Louvre
[46:21.000 --> 46:29.440]  pyramid his cousin wrote a book in France that was the best seller about
[46:29.440 --> 46:35.960]  how he liked to rape little boys and how they enjoyed them as slaves and how
[46:35.960 --> 46:41.680]  he wouldn't apologize he's one of the best friends it's reported of Nicholas
[46:41.680 --> 46:50.800]  Sarkozy and his wife the supermodel is one of his best friends and he writes
[46:50.800 --> 46:57.840]  about raping small children and he writes about it in the news and is hailed
[46:57.840 --> 47:02.640]  and this is just one of thousands of pieces I've seen on France where they
[47:02.640 --> 47:09.160]  advertised with pleasure that they are going to grab our children off the
[47:09.160 --> 47:13.640]  streets and our women and they're going to rip their teeth out with pliers and
[47:13.640 --> 47:17.480]  they're going to burn them with electrical wire and they're going to keep
[47:17.480 --> 47:23.000]  on doing it and doing it and doing it and there's nothing you are going to do
[47:23.000 --> 47:27.960]  just stop them in their minds eye and no one's going to bring them to justice
[47:27.960 --> 47:31.880]  and Dinecore and Halliburton are going to run giant kidnapping rings and it's
[47:31.880 --> 47:36.120]  going to be in the BBC and no one's going to get in trouble and one time
[47:36.120 --> 47:40.680]  during a protest there were police out guarding the Dinecore building now has a
[47:40.680 --> 47:45.080]  new name in downtown Austin and I said to them do you know Dinecore runs child
[47:45.080 --> 47:52.280]  kidnapping rings and the police captain laughed at me and said I know Jones I
[47:52.280 --> 48:00.400]  work there sometimes and I said to this group of 10 or 12 cops laughing at me I
[48:00.400 --> 48:04.240]  said are you joking do you I mean you really know about that they just laughed
[48:04.240 --> 48:10.000]  and said why don't you go find a black helicopter listen to me fool do you think
[48:10.000 --> 48:13.400]  these people are going to stop with women and children they love evil they
[48:13.400 --> 48:18.400]  love doing bad they are putting poisons in your shots they are poisoning your
[48:18.400 --> 48:24.800]  water big man big man thinks nobody's above him big man won't face there's
[48:24.800 --> 48:30.120]  evil above him big man won't face there's danger in his life he will bow down to
[48:30.120 --> 48:34.720]  the evil and decide that he's part of it and that he's cool I don't know if
[48:34.720 --> 48:42.320]  those Austin cops were joking but I'll tell you this my friend this is no
[48:42.320 --> 48:48.320]  laughing manner here's an article titled the real sicko and info wars.com it
[48:48.320 --> 48:53.120]  links to mainstream news articles in England the United States and in
[48:53.120 --> 49:00.840]  France Frederick Mitterrand in his 2005 autobiography The Bad Life Mr. Mitterrand
[49:00.840 --> 49:05.280]  wrote I got into the habit of paying for boys all these rituals of the market
[49:05.280 --> 49:10.920]  for youth the slave market excites me enormously he added one could judge this
[49:10.920 --> 49:14.760]  abominable spectacle from the moral standpoint but it pleases me beyond
[49:14.760 --> 49:20.000]  reasonable that translates in French into reasonable and finally the
[49:20.000 --> 49:26.160]  profession the profusion of very attractive and immediately available
[49:26.160 --> 49:32.760]  young boys puts me in a state of desire that I can no longer hide nor hinder as I
[49:32.760 --> 49:38.760]  know that I will not be refused and it goes on how could such a man escape
[49:38.760 --> 49:43.480]  justice much less become a member of Sarkozy's cabinet it was only in June
[49:43.480 --> 49:46.760]  that he joined the cabinet and was considered a great catch for Mr. Sarkozy
[49:46.760 --> 49:51.160]  as proof of his open style of government and the minister comes from the grand
[49:51.160 --> 49:55.200]  socialist family and is admired by the many in the left with cultural
[49:55.200 --> 50:01.080]  establishment Carla Sarkozy the first lady was said to have had a hand in his
[50:01.080 --> 50:09.640]  nomination and the article goes on to talk about Roman Polanski raping a drugged
[50:09.640 --> 50:15.680]  13 year old girl as he held her down even though she was drug she fought
[50:15.680 --> 50:23.040]  raping her sodomizing her but see to the establishment she's just a bundle of
[50:23.040 --> 50:28.760]  grapes she's a stake on a platter she's a delicacy and then see after you've
[50:28.760 --> 50:32.720]  raped little girls and rape little boys it's not enough then you want to pull
[50:32.720 --> 50:36.480]  their teeth out and the establishment says sometimes you don't like it at first
[50:36.480 --> 50:43.240]  but later you get a taste for it it becomes beautiful to them I'll ever
[50:43.240 --> 50:47.440]  forget seeing Arnold Schwarzenegger in a German newspaper visiting his favorite

[52:10.440 --> 52:15.360]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage? Was it engineered by you, David
[52:15.360 --> 52:26.360]  Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the CFR? The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[52:26.360 --> 52:32.360]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[52:32.360 --> 52:39.360]  An inside job? How dare you?
[52:39.360 --> 52:43.360]  If you know that there's treason going on you can be held accountable for treason yourself.

[54:21.360 --> 54:30.360]  You know why George Arwell, that was his pen name, Eric Blair, who wrote scores of essays.
[54:30.360 --> 54:38.360]  There's a lot of books that have compendiums of his essays. I suggest you read his nonfiction, like To Kill an Elephant.
[54:38.360 --> 54:45.360]  He worked as a member of the Imperial Police in India oppressing people.
[54:45.360 --> 54:51.360]  He then thought he was rebelling and went and joined the communists, found out they were controlled by the same people,
[54:51.360 --> 54:59.360]  was shot through the neck in front line battle with the Germans in 1938-39 in Spain in the Franco War.
[55:02.360 --> 55:10.360]  He came back and worked for the BBC at the highest levels, writing national and international propaganda releases for radio and film.
[55:10.360 --> 55:17.360]  And he wrote in 1984, and O'Brien is torturing Winston in the Ministry of Love.
[55:21.360 --> 55:29.360]  It's the opposite of love. And he tells him, he says, I'm the priest of power and I'm going to be tortured and killed by the government as well, but I love it.
[55:29.360 --> 55:33.360]  This is about trampling and being trampled on Winston.
[55:33.360 --> 55:41.360]  George Arwell, the real deal.
[55:41.360 --> 55:49.360]  I bet you didn't know the evidence is very conclusive that they killed him for writing 1984.
[55:49.360 --> 55:52.360]  He died a year after its release.
[55:54.360 --> 55:59.360]  You know, he traveled to an island and hid out to write it in Scotland.
[55:59.360 --> 56:09.360]  You might want to read that book again, because the establishment is here to press on the nerve of power.
[56:09.360 --> 56:16.360]  They are the priests of power, and they always cloak themselves in black uniforms.
[56:16.360 --> 56:25.360]  They always have secret police, and when they get control of a nation, they always kill large numbers of the people, because that's their nature.
[56:25.360 --> 56:30.360]  That's who they are. That's what they are.
[56:33.360 --> 56:38.360]  And so this entire world government is a giant dungeon.
[56:38.360 --> 56:48.360]  Dungeons are so the establishment can carry out their favorite delight of torturing and humiliating and killing and raping.
[56:48.360 --> 56:53.360]  That's why part of the CIA interrogation is rape and sexual torture.
[56:53.360 --> 56:57.360]  That's what the Army's own report admitted out of Abu Ghraib.
[56:57.360 --> 56:59.360]  They were ordered to do it.
[56:59.360 --> 57:06.360]  To do things I won't even mention here on air, but it deals with acid and rape.
[57:09.360 --> 57:11.360]  That is the dark side.
[57:11.360 --> 57:14.360]  That is America being wedded to pure evil.
[57:14.360 --> 57:21.360]  Our movie stars, the good guys, the heroes are people like Mr. Bauer.
[57:21.360 --> 57:24.360]  Jack Bauer in 24.
[57:24.360 --> 57:27.360]  Sometimes he tortures someone innocent, but it doesn't matter.
[57:27.360 --> 57:30.360]  He does it in the spirit of saving America.
[57:30.360 --> 57:34.360]  You were being sold on naked evil.
[57:37.360 --> 57:43.360]  We're going to go live at prismplanet.tv for the balance of the radio show today.

[57:56.360 --> 57:58.360]  I was out of town to comment on that.
[57:58.360 --> 58:02.360]  Dollar reaches breaking point as bank shift reserves Bloomberg.
[58:02.360 --> 58:06.360]  Waco siege enforcer to rule over global police force.

[1:01:13.360 --> 1:01:16.360]  But I want to do something a little bit different today.
[1:01:16.360 --> 1:01:21.360]  I want to try to give you the floor here and get into what you think is most important.
[1:01:21.360 --> 1:01:25.360]  I know when we left off with that little interview we did last Wednesday for 30 minutes,
[1:01:25.360 --> 1:01:32.360]  you said the awakening is happening and you see the New World Order falling in 2014 to 2016.
[1:01:32.360 --> 1:01:36.360]  I agree with you that that's the window of when their fall will occur
[1:01:36.360 --> 1:01:39.360]  and we're able to cause the mass revelation or awakening.
[1:01:39.360 --> 1:01:43.360]  But later I would like you to get into that or you can get into that first.
[1:01:43.360 --> 1:01:48.360]  Whatever is most important, in David Ike's mind right now, welcome.
[1:01:48.360 --> 1:01:49.360]  Thanks, Alex.
[1:01:49.360 --> 1:01:53.360]  Well, I've been speaking in the last few weeks in Amsterdam.
[1:01:53.360 --> 1:01:59.360]  People came from across Europe, then in Washington State, yesterday in Santa Fe.
[1:01:59.360 --> 1:02:04.360]  All different kinds of people from all walks of life.
[1:02:04.360 --> 1:02:09.360]  And there's no question whatsoever that there is a big awakening going on
[1:02:09.360 --> 1:02:14.360]  because one of the things I get into in detail when I talk
[1:02:14.360 --> 1:02:19.360]  is that the foundation of this whole global conspiracy
[1:02:19.360 --> 1:02:25.360]  is keeping people's sense of perception, sense of self in the world
[1:02:25.360 --> 1:02:28.360]  within a narrow band that suits the agenda.
[1:02:28.360 --> 1:02:31.360]  They have to put people who are infinite consciousness.
[1:02:31.360 --> 1:02:35.360]  All that is, has been and ever will be having an experience in this reality.
[1:02:35.360 --> 1:02:40.360]  They have to get those people to believe that they are their name,
[1:02:40.360 --> 1:02:46.360]  they are their job, they are their nation, whatever, their culture.
[1:02:46.360 --> 1:02:49.360]  When they are experiences, it's not who they are.
[1:02:49.360 --> 1:02:53.360]  This reality is a virtual reality.
[1:02:53.360 --> 1:02:59.360]  What's happening now is that technology is mirroring the reality that we're experiencing.
[1:02:59.360 --> 1:03:02.360]  I've been researching this in great depth for a long time.
[1:03:02.360 --> 1:03:06.360]  If I want to go on the Internet, I can't just go on the Internet,
[1:03:06.360 --> 1:03:10.360]  I have to have a conduit, an interface that takes me through
[1:03:10.360 --> 1:03:12.360]  so I can observe the Internet. It's called a computer.
[1:03:12.360 --> 1:03:15.360]  Without that interface, I can't get on the Internet.
[1:03:15.360 --> 1:03:21.360]  Consciousness, which is awareness, if you like, energy, it's not any form.
[1:03:21.360 --> 1:03:25.360]  That has to have a conduit to experience this reality.
[1:03:25.360 --> 1:03:29.360]  In that conduit, we call body-mind.
[1:03:29.360 --> 1:03:35.360]  It's fine if you are sitting in front of a computer and you're on the Internet.
[1:03:35.360 --> 1:03:40.360]  You are aware that the computer is what you're observing through.
[1:03:40.360 --> 1:03:46.360]  Imagine if you started to believe that you were the computer.
[1:03:46.360 --> 1:03:50.360]  Suddenly, you've lost complete control of your reality
[1:03:50.360 --> 1:03:54.360]  because the computer is now making decisions about where you go on the Internet,
[1:03:54.360 --> 1:03:58.360]  what you think of it. When you study the way society is structured,
[1:03:58.360 --> 1:04:02.360]  whether it's education or whatever it is,
[1:04:02.360 --> 1:04:08.360]  it's structured to pull people into the lower level of awareness we call mind,
[1:04:08.360 --> 1:04:13.360]  the interface, so that they believe that who they are is their name
[1:04:13.360 --> 1:04:16.360]  and their job and their income bracket and their culture and all the rest of it,
[1:04:16.360 --> 1:04:19.360]  their experiences. What is happening, Alex,
[1:04:19.360 --> 1:04:22.360]  it happened to me years ago, it's happening to so many people,
[1:04:22.360 --> 1:04:25.360]  is they're starting to move, their point of observation,
[1:04:25.360 --> 1:04:28.360]  their sense of self-identity.
[1:04:28.360 --> 1:04:32.360]  From I am David Ike born in last year in 1952,
[1:04:32.360 --> 1:04:37.360]  to I am Infinite Consciousness having an experience as David Ike born in last year in 1952,
[1:04:37.360 --> 1:04:40.360]  and that shift completely changes everything
[1:04:40.360 --> 1:04:43.360]  because you're not looking at a single dot anymore,
[1:04:43.360 --> 1:04:46.360]  you're able to see how everything connects.
[1:04:46.360 --> 1:04:53.360]  David, we've got a break, we've got a break here,
[1:04:53.360 --> 1:04:58.360]  stay there and we'll come back and continue along this key line.
[1:04:58.360 --> 1:05:00.360]  On the other side of this break, stay with us.
[1:05:00.360 --> 1:05:03.360]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie
[1:05:03.360 --> 1:05:05.360]  that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[1:05:05.360 --> 1:05:07.360]  Will you continue to be their profit center,
[1:05:07.360 --> 1:05:10.360]  buying their processed food that makes you sick,
[1:05:10.360 --> 1:05:12.360]  go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[1:05:12.360 --> 1:05:15.360]  You don't have to cooperate, there is a solution.
[1:05:15.360 --> 1:05:18.360]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love,
[1:05:18.360 --> 1:05:21.360]  have been providing products for the last five years
[1:05:21.360 --> 1:05:23.360]  that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[1:05:23.360 --> 1:05:26.360]  Try their inner food with 20 organic ingredients,
[1:05:26.360 --> 1:05:29.360]  full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need
[1:05:29.360 --> 1:05:31.360]  and will keep you well.
[1:05:31.360 --> 1:05:34.360]  It even won the award for best super food of 2009
[1:05:34.360 --> 1:05:37.360]  from our friend Mike Adams, the health manager.
[1:05:37.360 --> 1:05:40.360]  I love their NutriCafe, great organic coffee,
[1:05:40.360 --> 1:05:43.360]  infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[1:05:43.360 --> 1:05:45.360]  Try all of their truly honest products
[1:05:45.360 --> 1:05:47.360]  that will keep you alive and healthy.

[1:08:06.360 --> 1:08:07.360]  Well, so does he.
[1:08:07.360 --> 1:08:09.360]  He's Alex Jones
[1:08:09.360 --> 1:08:11.360]  on the GCN Radio Network
[1:08:11.360 --> 1:08:14.360]  and now, live from Austin, Texas,
[1:08:14.360 --> 1:08:23.360]  Alex Jones.
[1:08:23.360 --> 1:08:29.360]  I have never met David Iken person
[1:08:29.360 --> 1:08:32.360]  that I've interviewed many, many times
[1:08:32.360 --> 1:08:35.360]  and always been honored to have him on
[1:08:35.360 --> 1:08:40.360]  and he's taught me quite a lot.
[1:08:40.360 --> 1:08:42.360]  But really, David just shows us
[1:08:42.360 --> 1:08:43.360]  what is already in us,
[1:08:43.360 --> 1:08:44.360]  what we already innately knew,
[1:08:44.360 --> 1:08:46.360]  just weren't consciously focusing on.
[1:08:46.360 --> 1:08:48.360]  And I was really excited.
[1:08:48.360 --> 1:08:50.360]  I made the split second decision last Wednesday
[1:08:50.360 --> 1:08:52.360]  while talking to David during a break.
[1:08:52.360 --> 1:08:56.360]  To go to Phoenix this next Saturday
[1:08:56.360 --> 1:08:57.360]  where he's speaking
[1:08:57.360 --> 1:08:58.360]  because he says he won't be back to the U.S.
[1:08:58.360 --> 1:09:00.360]  perhaps for several years.
[1:09:00.360 --> 1:09:02.360]  There's so many demands in Asia and Europe
[1:09:02.360 --> 1:09:04.360]  and he feels like he's really
[1:09:04.360 --> 1:09:06.360]  woke a lot of people up here
[1:09:06.360 --> 1:09:07.360]  and he wants to focus on Europe
[1:09:07.360 --> 1:09:08.360]  and so I wanted to go
[1:09:08.360 --> 1:09:12.360]  and I was invited by a lot of other people to go.
[1:09:12.360 --> 1:09:14.360]  Then my wife pointed out this weekend,
[1:09:14.360 --> 1:09:15.360]  she said, you know,
[1:09:15.360 --> 1:09:18.360]  you've got a wedding next Saturday
[1:09:18.360 --> 1:09:20.360]  that you've agreed to go to
[1:09:20.360 --> 1:09:23.360]  and one of my daughters is a bridesmaid in it
[1:09:23.360 --> 1:09:25.360]  so I'm going to go take part
[1:09:25.360 --> 1:09:29.360]  in that ancient human ritual of wedding.
[1:09:29.360 --> 1:09:30.360]  So I won't be able to be there
[1:09:30.360 --> 1:09:34.360]  but I am sending Rob, Do, and Aaron Dykes.
[1:09:34.360 --> 1:09:37.360]  So we're very, very excited about that.
[1:09:37.360 --> 1:09:39.360]  Also I didn't mention last hour
[1:09:39.360 --> 1:09:43.360]  Fall of the Republic is coming out
[1:09:43.360 --> 1:09:45.360]  the 21st next Wednesday
[1:09:45.360 --> 1:09:47.360]  and we're getting the biggest response ever to this.
[1:09:47.360 --> 1:09:48.360]  I want to thank everybody.
[1:09:48.360 --> 1:09:50.360]  Please go get the three different trailers
[1:09:50.360 --> 1:09:52.360]  that are up on the site.
[1:09:52.360 --> 1:09:53.360]  Easiest place to find them
[1:09:53.360 --> 1:09:55.360]  is click on the fall of the Republic banner.
[1:09:55.360 --> 1:09:57.360]  Please send them out to your whole email list.
[1:09:57.360 --> 1:09:59.360]  Please post it on websites.
[1:09:59.360 --> 1:10:00.360]  We need this film to be the biggest ever
[1:10:00.360 --> 1:10:03.360]  because it breaks down the entire program.
[1:10:03.360 --> 1:10:04.360]  That said, going back to David Icke
[1:10:04.360 --> 1:10:05.360]  for the balance of the hour.
[1:10:05.360 --> 1:10:08.360]  David, some stations don't carry that first five minutes.
[1:10:08.360 --> 1:10:12.360]  You were getting into how people interface reality
[1:10:12.360 --> 1:10:14.360]  just like we interface the Internet through a computer
[1:10:14.360 --> 1:10:17.360]  and then the system, the social engineers,
[1:10:17.360 --> 1:10:23.360]  they tend to try to engineer our mental focus
[1:10:23.360 --> 1:10:27.360]  onto just the computer itself
[1:10:27.360 --> 1:10:31.360]  when really our larger mind and consciousness
[1:10:31.360 --> 1:10:34.360]  and who we are is accessing the computer,
[1:10:34.360 --> 1:10:37.360]  the five or the six senses.
[1:10:37.360 --> 1:10:41.360]  Yeah, what we call the five senses
[1:10:41.360 --> 1:10:45.360]  and the body, mind, and the brain,
[1:10:45.360 --> 1:10:49.360]  the computer interface that we use to go onto the Internet
[1:10:49.360 --> 1:10:54.360]  because this is a virtual reality that we are experiencing.
[1:10:54.360 --> 1:10:58.360]  And really, it was only when I started to understand
[1:10:58.360 --> 1:11:01.360]  the nature of the reality we're experiencing
[1:11:01.360 --> 1:11:05.360]  that I could really grasp in a much greater way
[1:11:05.360 --> 1:11:08.360]  the nature of the conspiracy that we're experiencing
[1:11:08.360 --> 1:11:13.360]  because one of the things, or a crucial thing
[1:11:13.360 --> 1:11:18.360]  that is imposed upon us or what is suppressed
[1:11:18.360 --> 1:11:20.360]  is the nature of the reality we're experiencing.
[1:11:20.360 --> 1:11:24.360]  You know, you can go around the world now
[1:11:24.360 --> 1:11:28.360]  and you can go 24-7 watching television channel
[1:11:28.360 --> 1:11:32.360]  after television channel, hundreds of them, thousands of them.
[1:11:32.360 --> 1:11:36.360]  When do you ever see a program or an article
[1:11:36.360 --> 1:11:40.360]  in any newspaper or magazine that is asking this question,
[1:11:40.360 --> 1:11:42.360]  what is the reality we're experiencing?
[1:11:42.360 --> 1:11:45.360]  Who are we? What are we doing here?
[1:11:45.360 --> 1:11:47.360]  These big questions are never asked
[1:11:47.360 --> 1:11:50.360]  because if you ask them, you start to get big answers
[1:11:50.360 --> 1:11:53.360]  and the big answers go, whoa, I can see it now.
[1:11:53.360 --> 1:12:00.360]  The Matrix Movie series was so accurate in its symbolism
[1:12:00.360 --> 1:12:03.360]  and indeed more than that, accurate literally in many, many ways.
[1:12:03.360 --> 1:12:10.360]  And when the DO character said in a computer simulation,
[1:12:10.360 --> 1:12:14.360]  this isn't real, and the Morpheus character said,
[1:12:14.360 --> 1:12:15.360]  what is real?
[1:12:15.360 --> 1:12:19.360]  If you're talking about what you can see, touch, hear, taste,
[1:12:19.360 --> 1:12:23.360]  then real is just electrical signals interpreted by your brain
[1:12:23.360 --> 1:12:27.360]  and it is because the prime level of this reality
[1:12:27.360 --> 1:12:31.360]  is a vibrational field, a vibrational construct.
[1:12:31.360 --> 1:12:34.360]  It's like the wireless internet.
[1:12:34.360 --> 1:12:37.360]  You know, I'm sitting here now, this hotel I'm in,
[1:12:37.360 --> 1:12:41.360]  as the wireless internet, I'm looking around, where is it?
[1:12:41.360 --> 1:12:44.360]  I can't see it, but if I tune this computer to the internet,
[1:12:44.360 --> 1:12:48.360]  out of the ether, it will pull a collective reality.
[1:12:48.360 --> 1:12:51.360]  We call the World Wide Web.
[1:12:51.360 --> 1:12:54.360]  Now our reality that we're experiencing is like that.
[1:12:54.360 --> 1:12:58.360]  These five senses decode vibrational information
[1:12:58.360 --> 1:13:02.360]  encoded in what we call light, the photons of light, information.
[1:13:02.360 --> 1:13:05.360]  They turn it into electrical signals, they send it to the brain
[1:13:05.360 --> 1:13:11.360]  and the brain decodes it into the reality that we think we're experiencing.
[1:13:11.360 --> 1:13:13.360]  Actually, it's not outside of us, it's inside of us.
[1:13:13.360 --> 1:13:16.360]  It's a holographic illusion.
[1:13:16.360 --> 1:13:18.360]  You know, if you say to someone, tell me about the internet,
[1:13:18.360 --> 1:13:22.360]  they'll say, well, it's graphics and websites and colours and words.
[1:13:22.360 --> 1:13:26.360]  Yes, it is, but only on the screen that you're looking at.
[1:13:26.360 --> 1:13:29.360]  Everywhere else, it's electronic circuits, etc.
[1:13:29.360 --> 1:13:30.360]  Tell me about television.
[1:13:30.360 --> 1:13:32.360]  Well, it's moving pictures on a screen.
[1:13:32.360 --> 1:13:34.360]  Yes, it is, but only on the screen.
[1:13:34.360 --> 1:13:37.360]  Everywhere else, it's not in that form.
[1:13:37.360 --> 1:13:41.360]  And if you take information on a disk and you put it in a computer,
[1:13:41.360 --> 1:13:43.360]  it's just information.
[1:13:43.360 --> 1:13:47.360]  The computer reads that information and turns it into pictures,
[1:13:47.360 --> 1:13:50.360]  moving pictures or whatever on the screen.
[1:13:50.360 --> 1:13:51.360]  That's what we're doing.
[1:13:51.360 --> 1:13:55.360]  Now, if you know that, Alex, because this is the knowledge
[1:13:55.360 --> 1:14:00.360]  that's passed along the top levels, the highest levels of the secret society network
[1:14:00.360 --> 1:14:04.360]  and systematically kept out of the public arena,
[1:14:04.360 --> 1:14:10.360]  it means that you know that if you can manipulate the way people read reality,
[1:14:10.360 --> 1:14:14.360]  read information, you can get them to create a reality that suits your agenda.
[1:14:14.360 --> 1:14:18.360]  For instance, one of the things I did when I was researching some of this
[1:14:18.360 --> 1:14:24.360]  is I went to hypnotist stage shows to watch them at work and you get people,
[1:14:24.360 --> 1:14:31.360]  their stooge is on the stage and the hypnotist implants a belief into their brain.
[1:14:31.360 --> 1:14:36.360]  A program, in other words, say he gives them a potato
[1:14:36.360 --> 1:14:40.360]  and he tells them, implants the belief they're eating an apple.
[1:14:40.360 --> 1:14:45.360]  What they do is they take a bite of the potato, which they should shy away from.
[1:14:45.360 --> 1:14:47.360]  But to them, it tastes like an apple.
[1:14:47.360 --> 1:14:48.360]  Why?
[1:14:48.360 --> 1:14:52.360]  Because when the electrical signal carrying the information of the potato
[1:14:52.360 --> 1:14:56.360]  hits the brain because of the implanted program,
[1:14:56.360 --> 1:15:02.360]  it doesn't read that, it reads the information as if it's an apple
[1:15:02.360 --> 1:15:04.360]  and so that's what the person tastes.
[1:15:04.360 --> 1:15:08.360]  Now, if you take that basic thing, which they can do so simply,
[1:15:08.360 --> 1:15:11.360]  these hypnotists, when they're working with people who are open to it,
[1:15:11.360 --> 1:15:17.360]  across the swathe of society, the 24-7 media, the education system,
[1:15:17.360 --> 1:15:21.360]  what passes for it and all these sources of information,
[1:15:21.360 --> 1:15:25.360]  what they're doing is they're programming a sense of reality.
[1:15:25.360 --> 1:15:28.360]  People like Wolf Blitzer and all these people, they're hypnotists,
[1:15:28.360 --> 1:15:31.360]  they don't know they are, 90% of them don't,
[1:15:31.360 --> 1:15:35.360]  but they are implanting a belief system, they're implanting a program
[1:15:35.360 --> 1:15:41.360]  and so people who accept that program then read reality to suit the program
[1:15:41.360 --> 1:15:43.360]  and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[1:15:43.360 --> 1:15:47.360]  This is a major level of how people are programmed to see the world
[1:15:47.360 --> 1:15:52.360]  in a way the system desires and crucially see themselves in a way the system desires.
[1:15:52.360 --> 1:15:57.360]  I'm just Joe Public, little me, I've got no power, like hell we have, no power.
[1:15:57.360 --> 1:16:02.360]  David, I want to add a point and get your response to it
[1:16:02.360 --> 1:16:05.360]  to simplify some of what you're saying.
[1:16:05.360 --> 1:16:10.360]  We are not the computer, we're using the computer to access this larger system
[1:16:10.360 --> 1:16:15.360]  that manifests just like our optic nerve manifest the three-dimensional world
[1:16:15.360 --> 1:16:20.360]  or television or our ears manifest what people are listening to now.
[1:16:20.360 --> 1:16:25.360]  It takes those sounds and decodes them, but instead the television, the culture, the media,
[1:16:25.360 --> 1:16:31.360]  it is trying to boil it down to where we're only reactive, only receiving
[1:16:31.360 --> 1:16:37.360]  and not directing our subconscious mind or our soul, our spirit in any way.
[1:16:37.360 --> 1:16:40.360]  We're becoming biological androids that are simply directed.
[1:16:40.360 --> 1:16:42.360]  Now let me add something to that.
[1:16:42.360 --> 1:16:49.360]  As you point out, the elite know that archetypal symbols, different terms, different ideas,
[1:16:49.360 --> 1:16:54.360]  different colors, they're using all these different integrated systems to control us
[1:16:54.360 --> 1:16:58.360]  and to manipulate us and they never want us thinking outside the box
[1:16:58.360 --> 1:17:02.360]  and seeing that larger paradigm because the minute you realize there's something
[1:17:02.360 --> 1:17:06.360]  much larger outside, then their defeat is imminent.
[1:17:06.360 --> 1:17:10.360]  Once that simple step can be made, but to expand on that,
[1:17:10.360 --> 1:17:15.360]  you notice how the social engineers, the eugenicists, the social Darwinists
[1:17:15.360 --> 1:17:19.360]  always say we're a disease, we're an animal, we're worthless,
[1:17:19.360 --> 1:17:24.360]  we have no soul, we can't direct ourselves, we have no destiny,
[1:17:24.360 --> 1:17:29.360]  we don't have any power, we simply react and that is their religion
[1:17:29.360 --> 1:17:33.360]  and they always tell you every child is not special, humanity is not special,
[1:17:33.360 --> 1:17:37.360]  but animals are, the elite will make decisions based on what's good for the animals
[1:17:37.360 --> 1:17:41.360]  and the earth, they know that we're an incredibly powerful species,
[1:17:41.360 --> 1:17:46.360]  they know we have an amazing destiny and the establishment want to control
[1:17:46.360 --> 1:17:50.360]  that destiny for themselves, they in their own writings that they don't really
[1:17:50.360 --> 1:17:55.360]  widely publicize but that are available publicly as you know, admit that we are
[1:17:55.360 --> 1:18:00.360]  this incredible species and this incredible group of builders,
[1:18:00.360 --> 1:18:04.360]  meant to have a destiny that we can't even imagine and so they're trying to get a corner
[1:18:04.360 --> 1:18:09.360]  on reality and future development, trying to shut that down and so that's why
[1:18:09.360 --> 1:18:13.360]  they're always telling us that we don't have any power and that we aren't effective
[1:18:13.360 --> 1:18:18.360]  and that we don't have some greater goal and why we should obsess on our neighbors
[1:18:18.360 --> 1:18:23.360]  and on fashion and on what we look like and on our weight when as you've said
[1:18:23.360 --> 1:18:29.360]  all this body is, is a earth suit that we are limitedly experiencing
[1:18:29.360 --> 1:18:34.360]  one tiny channel of the spectrum, go ahead.
[1:18:34.360 --> 1:18:42.360]  It is a tiny channel too Alex, I mean the mass matter that mainstream science says
[1:18:42.360 --> 1:18:47.360]  exists in this universe and far more does than they understand, I would suggest
[1:18:47.360 --> 1:18:52.360]  that the electromagnetic spectrum is something like 0.005% of what exists
[1:18:52.360 --> 1:18:57.360]  in this reality and visible light which is the only frequency range that we can
[1:18:57.360 --> 1:19:04.360]  decode through the five senses through sight is a fraction of the 0.005%.
[1:19:04.360 --> 1:19:13.360]  We're on a tiny holographic television station and if we think that that's all we are
[1:19:13.360 --> 1:19:19.360]  then of course we're being pulled into a very, very narrow band of a sense of possibility,
[1:19:19.360 --> 1:19:23.360]  sense of potential. Once you break out of that and you realize that within that band
[1:19:23.360 --> 1:19:28.360]  we are having an experience but it's not who we are then you start to open
[1:19:28.360 --> 1:19:32.360]  yourself to much greater levels of awareness. Not because you're special
[1:19:32.360 --> 1:19:37.360]  or you have to sit cross-legged on a mountain or meditate in a cave for 30 years
[1:19:37.360 --> 1:19:44.360]  you just have to move your point of self identity, your point of observation
[1:19:44.360 --> 1:19:50.360]  of self in the world from I am Charlie Jones to I am Infinite Consciousness
[1:19:50.360 --> 1:19:54.360]  and I am having an experience as Charlie Jones and when people do that,
[1:19:54.360 --> 1:19:57.360]  it happens to me, the shift that takes place.
[1:19:57.360 --> 1:20:00.360]  It's quantum, stay there, go on a break David Ike.
[1:20:00.360 --> 1:20:23.360]  We'll be right back.
[1:20:30.360 --> 1:20:58.360]  We'll be right back.
[1:21:01.360 --> 1:21:05.360]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[1:21:05.360 --> 1:21:10.360]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[1:21:10.360 --> 1:21:13.360]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[1:21:13.360 --> 1:21:16.360]  What their objective being world domination?
[1:21:16.360 --> 1:21:19.360]  For thousands of years their dark order grew.
[1:21:19.360 --> 1:21:22.360]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order,
[1:21:22.360 --> 1:21:29.360]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[1:21:29.360 --> 1:21:34.360]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[1:21:34.360 --> 1:21:38.360]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[1:21:38.360 --> 1:21:41.360]  Builder Bird is making great progress toward a world government.
[1:21:41.360 --> 1:21:44.360]  Most people have no idea, they're not after money, they have all the money they need.
[1:21:44.360 --> 1:21:46.360]  They're after power, yes they're after easier.

[1:22:26.360 --> 1:22:31.360]  Then cart the money off to a privately owned bank to have it lent back to us at interest,
[1:22:31.360 --> 1:22:33.360]  forcing us to pay taxes to service the debt.
[1:22:33.360 --> 1:22:36.360]  Is this capitalism or was Jefferson correct when he said,
[1:22:36.360 --> 1:23:00.360]  a central bank issuing a public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[1:23:00.360 --> 1:23:02.360]  Men, are you urinating more frequently?
[1:23:02.360 --> 1:23:04.360]  Do you wake up to urinate?
[1:23:04.360 --> 1:23:06.360]  Don't ignore your prostate health.
[1:23:06.360 --> 1:23:10.360]  See your doctor for checkups and call for a free bottle of beta-prostate.
[1:23:10.360 --> 1:23:14.360]  Beta-prostate is a natural supplement that helps your body support prostate health.
[1:23:14.360 --> 1:23:19.360]  Your prostate affects the quality of your life, including your sleeping habits and intimacy.
[1:23:19.360 --> 1:23:25.360]  Beta-prostate has plant sterols shown to support healthy urine flow and healthy sleeping habits.
[1:23:25.360 --> 1:23:30.360]  And beta-prostate is so powerful, you'd have to take 100 sawpaw metal capsules
[1:23:30.360 --> 1:23:34.360]  to get the same plant sterols found in one beta-prostate.
[1:23:34.360 --> 1:23:37.360]  New customers can get a free bottle of beta-prostate.
[1:23:37.360 --> 1:23:39.360]  You only pay shipping and handling.
[1:23:39.360 --> 1:23:44.360]  To get your free bottle of beta-prostate, call 1-800-360-8306.
[1:23:44.360 --> 1:23:47.360]  That's 1-800-360-8306.
[1:23:47.360 --> 1:23:50.360]  This offer is for one free bottle per household.
[1:23:50.360 --> 1:23:53.360]  Call now and try beta-prostate for free.
[1:23:53.360 --> 1:24:00.360]  Call 1-800-360-8306.
[1:24:24.360 --> 1:24:29.360]  In the time we have left, 35 minutes roughly with David Ike,
[1:24:32.360 --> 1:24:37.360]  I want to spend a little bit more time on the nature of reality, let him finish that point,
[1:24:37.360 --> 1:24:41.360]  and then I want to get into some of the latest things developing inside the New World Order,
[1:24:41.360 --> 1:24:45.360]  inside this false paradigm they have created.
[1:24:45.360 --> 1:24:49.360]  Going back to David Ike, we're trying to make a point about the awakening
[1:24:49.360 --> 1:24:52.360]  of someone you talked to when you were in New Mexico.
[1:24:52.360 --> 1:24:55.360]  It's funny how life goes.
[1:24:55.360 --> 1:25:00.360]  When I first began to consciously wake up myself about 20 years ago,
[1:25:00.360 --> 1:25:06.360]  I went through a real challenging time because the top of my head opened
[1:25:06.360 --> 1:25:13.360]  and information came in that was so vast and so amazing.
[1:25:13.360 --> 1:25:18.360]  The volume of it, basically I had a period of about three months
[1:25:18.360 --> 1:25:23.360]  when it was like you press too many keys on a computer and the computer freezes
[1:25:23.360 --> 1:25:27.360]  and goes, I can't filter this, I can't compute this, I'm freezing.
[1:25:27.360 --> 1:25:33.360]  After that three months happened, I kind of everything morphed back into
[1:25:33.360 --> 1:25:38.360]  how was the guy I was before, but I saw the world completely differently.
[1:25:38.360 --> 1:25:44.360]  One of the things that I picked up at that time was that there was a cycle coming
[1:25:44.360 --> 1:25:50.360]  of vibrational change that was going to wake people up from this amnesia
[1:25:50.360 --> 1:25:54.360]  and there seemed no chance of it at the time, no sign of it.
[1:25:54.360 --> 1:25:58.360]  The first book I ever wrote after I had my awakening experience,
[1:25:58.360 --> 1:26:03.360]  I actually called Truth Vibrations because after this vibrational change
[1:26:03.360 --> 1:26:08.360]  that was going to bring all that had been hidden to the surface so people could see it.
[1:26:08.360 --> 1:26:11.360]  Like again, where's the evidence?
[1:26:11.360 --> 1:26:15.360]  20 years later, look at it and I am seeing as I travel around the world
[1:26:15.360 --> 1:26:18.360]  this incredible awakening that's going on.
[1:26:18.360 --> 1:26:25.360]  I met a lovely guy in Santa Fe at the tour yesterday who'd come from Texas
[1:26:25.360 --> 1:26:28.360]  and he said to me three months ago, I was totally asleep,
[1:26:28.360 --> 1:26:34.360]  and three months later he's coming to an event, he's flying from Texas to Santa Fe to this event.
[1:26:34.360 --> 1:26:42.360]  People are waking up so fast and it's this awakening that is the real point
[1:26:42.360 --> 1:26:46.360]  I would suggest of what's going on in terms of all this new world order.
[1:26:46.360 --> 1:26:51.360]  It's absolutely no accident that they are throwing everything at us
[1:26:51.360 --> 1:26:55.360]  and they're preparing to throw everything they can in the next few years at us.
[1:26:55.360 --> 1:27:00.360]  At the time this awakening has taken place, I picked up a long time ago, years ago,
[1:27:00.360 --> 1:27:04.360]  that the core, the inner core of this new world order,
[1:27:04.360 --> 1:27:09.360]  absolutely knew that this awakening was coming and this vibrational cycle was coming
[1:27:09.360 --> 1:27:12.360]  that was going to awaken people to their true nature
[1:27:12.360 --> 1:27:15.360]  and they're backling and backling to keep the lid on it.
[1:27:15.360 --> 1:27:21.360]  And what's fantastic Alex, as a wonderful line in the sand that we could stand together on,
[1:27:21.360 --> 1:27:25.360]  the number of people who were seeing this swine flu vaccine,
[1:27:25.360 --> 1:27:30.360]  what it is, you imagine maybe ten years ago if they had played this, people had just lined up,
[1:27:30.360 --> 1:27:33.360]  not even thought about it, look at the change that's taking place
[1:27:33.360 --> 1:27:36.360]  and it's happening so fast, it's an exponential curve.
[1:27:36.360 --> 1:27:42.360]  And what we're looking at is the irresistible force, which is this awakening,
[1:27:42.360 --> 1:27:48.360]  it's coming face to face with the immovable object, the conspiracy which thinks it's immovable
[1:27:48.360 --> 1:27:51.360]  but isn't wishful thinking, Mr Rothschild and Co.
[1:27:51.360 --> 1:27:57.360]  and they are going to push forward with this for a while and it's going to seem as if it's going the wrong way
[1:27:57.360 --> 1:28:03.360]  and all is lost, but by 2016, this whole control system is coming down.
[1:28:03.360 --> 1:28:07.360]  Why? Because it's a vibrational construct like everything is
[1:28:07.360 --> 1:28:12.360]  and as we awaken and this vibrational change takes place,
[1:28:12.360 --> 1:28:18.360]  that construct is going to be unpicked, it cannot survive this, it cannot.
[1:28:18.360 --> 1:28:27.360]  What we need to do, I strongly suggest, is slow the progress down of this conspiracy as much as we can
[1:28:27.360 --> 1:28:33.360]  so that it's not as extreme by the time it goes down as it will be if we do nothing.
[1:28:33.360 --> 1:28:37.360]  We need to slow it down, it's progress through non-cooperation.
[1:28:37.360 --> 1:28:40.360]  It only exists because we cooperate with it.
[1:28:40.360 --> 1:28:46.360]  A handful of people comparatively at the core of this who know in full knowledge
[1:28:46.360 --> 1:28:49.360]  what's happening why and what it's for.
[1:28:49.360 --> 1:28:55.360]  We've got the numbers, we stop cooperating with our own enslavement
[1:28:55.360 --> 1:29:01.360]  and we'll slow this down very, very fast as we're showing with the swine flu vaccination.
[1:29:01.360 --> 1:29:04.360]  They are not going to get the numbers they want it, they're not
[1:29:04.360 --> 1:29:06.360]  and they're going to try to up the ante to get them.
[1:29:06.360 --> 1:29:10.360]  We must keep that backbone stiff and not succumb to it.
[1:29:10.360 --> 1:29:14.360]  Absolutely, David, and you see them losing more and more ground.
[1:29:14.360 --> 1:29:19.360]  You see them panicking as they try to shift us into a new paradigm
[1:29:19.360 --> 1:29:26.360]  of even greater dehumanization and tyranny where torture and war and death and secret police are the new goodness.
[1:29:26.360 --> 1:29:32.360]  They are trying to, they understand we're awakening and shifting out of their present tyranny
[1:29:32.360 --> 1:29:37.360]  so they're trying to do a judo move and bring us into even greater oppression
[1:29:37.360 --> 1:29:42.360]  but at every point their control is collapsing
[1:29:42.360 --> 1:29:47.360]  and as you said we've got to slow them down because they're going to throw everything at us
[1:29:47.360 --> 1:29:51.360]  including World War 3 and it's going to be deadly dangerous.
[1:29:51.360 --> 1:29:54.360]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[1:29:54.360 --> 1:29:58.360]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[1:30:01.360 --> 1:30:04.360]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[1:30:04.360 --> 1:30:09.360]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[1:30:09.360 --> 1:30:14.360]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[1:30:14.360 --> 1:30:18.360]  Food is your only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it?
[1:30:18.360 --> 1:30:21.360]  Now or after the battle starts. When will you need it?
[1:30:21.360 --> 1:30:25.360]  Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food?
[1:30:25.360 --> 1:30:29.360]  Will it make your children sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself
[1:30:29.360 --> 1:30:32.360]  will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[1:30:32.360 --> 1:30:35.360]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[1:30:35.360 --> 1:30:39.360]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[1:30:39.360 --> 1:30:41.360]  How much will you need? We don't know.
[1:30:41.360 --> 1:30:44.360]  How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones.
[1:30:44.360 --> 1:30:47.360]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[1:30:47.360 --> 1:30:55.360]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com
[1:30:55.360 --> 1:30:59.360]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633
[1:30:59.360 --> 1:31:03.360]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie
[1:31:03.360 --> 1:31:05.360]  that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[1:31:05.360 --> 1:31:10.360]  Will you continue to be their profit center? Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[1:31:10.360 --> 1:31:14.360]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs? You don't have to cooperate.
[1:31:14.360 --> 1:31:15.360]  There is a solution.
[1:31:15.360 --> 1:31:18.360]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love,
[1:31:18.360 --> 1:31:21.360]  have been providing products for the last five years

[1:31:36.360 --> 1:31:39.360]  I love their Nutric Cafe, great organic coffee
[1:31:39.360 --> 1:31:42.360]  infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.

[1:32:33.360 --> 1:32:36.360]  and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[1:32:36.360 --> 1:32:39.360]  Disease organisms like bacteria, viruses and cancer
[1:32:39.360 --> 1:32:43.360]  cannot survive in an alkaline high pH environment.

[1:32:54.360 --> 1:32:59.360]  2-6-940-917-76 today
[1:32:59.360 --> 1:33:09.360]  Music
[1:33:09.360 --> 1:33:14.360]  I was sitting in traffic listening to the radio
[1:33:14.360 --> 1:33:18.360]  David Ike will be with us 15 minutes into the next hour
[1:33:18.360 --> 1:33:23.360]  I'm then going to cover all this news
[1:33:23.360 --> 1:33:29.360]  headline dollar reaches breaking point as bank shift reserves Bloomberg
[1:33:29.360 --> 1:33:33.360]  Obama getting the Nobel Peace Prize
[1:33:33.360 --> 1:33:37.360]  that's all part of just flaunting corruption in our face
[1:33:37.360 --> 1:33:43.360]  trying to teach us to just submit and accept the lies and corruption and just capitulate
[1:33:43.360 --> 1:33:46.360]  We're going to go back to David Ike in just a moment
[1:33:46.360 --> 1:33:50.360]  the power of the people taking action is so important
[1:33:50.360 --> 1:33:55.360]  obviously that's a very simple statement but also very profound
[1:33:55.360 --> 1:33:59.360]  and the public has been brought into this deep false reality
[1:33:59.360 --> 1:34:01.360]  they've been hypnotized
[1:34:01.360 --> 1:34:04.360]  they've been brought into this false left right paradigm
[1:34:04.360 --> 1:34:10.360]  they have had their priorities set by Madison Avenue
[1:34:10.360 --> 1:34:14.360]  they have literally been put into an alpha state of mind control by the television set
[1:34:14.360 --> 1:34:19.360]  and my new film Fall of the Republic Vol. 1
[1:34:19.360 --> 1:34:22.360]  is a quantum leap from my other films
[1:34:22.360 --> 1:34:27.360]  the other films are excellent informative and are among some of the most watched out there
[1:34:27.360 --> 1:34:33.360]  even the major publication New Republic Attacks Me
[1:34:33.360 --> 1:34:36.360]  says I'm the most dangerous person out there basically
[1:34:36.360 --> 1:34:40.360]  and says that I am the counterculture icon
[1:34:40.360 --> 1:34:43.360]  and that's actually scary
[1:34:43.360 --> 1:34:47.360]  and I'm on the White House Enemies list number 24 or 25
[1:34:47.360 --> 1:34:49.360]  they're singling me out
[1:34:49.360 --> 1:34:50.360]  why is that?
[1:34:50.360 --> 1:34:53.360]  well they mention the Obama deception
[1:34:53.360 --> 1:34:56.360]  and they say it's been seen more than 4 million times on YouTube alone
[1:34:56.360 --> 1:34:59.360]  and that's true, more than 20 million times that we know of on the web
[1:34:59.360 --> 1:35:03.360]  just on different places where we can count up the views
[1:35:03.360 --> 1:35:07.360]  we need to not just have Fall of the Republic
[1:35:07.360 --> 1:35:09.360]  become a...
[1:35:09.360 --> 1:35:12.360]  it is a quantum better in production, more informative
[1:35:12.360 --> 1:35:17.360]  it needs to be seen by a quantum level by more people
[1:35:17.360 --> 1:35:21.360]  and the ball is in your court
[1:35:21.360 --> 1:35:24.360]  you can pre-order it right now
[1:35:24.360 --> 1:35:28.360]  we're only nine days away from its release
[1:35:28.360 --> 1:35:30.360]  October 21st, next Wednesday
[1:35:30.360 --> 1:35:34.360]  and the DVDs are scheduled to be arriving here on Friday
[1:35:34.360 --> 1:35:39.360]  we're going to start shipping those babies out on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday
[1:35:39.360 --> 1:35:43.360]  and so as your orders come in, they will be shipped out
[1:35:43.360 --> 1:35:45.360]  in the order that they are received
[1:35:45.360 --> 1:35:50.360]  we've hired a few extra people to try to rush all this out as quickly as possible
[1:35:50.360 --> 1:35:52.360]  and we're getting better and better about shipping stuff quickly
[1:35:52.360 --> 1:35:54.360]  the point is if you want Fall of the Republic
[1:35:54.360 --> 1:35:56.360]  go to falloftherepublic.com
[1:35:56.360 --> 1:35:58.360]  you can order it there or at infowars.com
[1:35:58.360 --> 1:36:06.360]  or call toll free 888-253-3139-888-253-3139
[1:36:06.360 --> 1:36:10.360]  you'll also be able to watch it October 21st
[1:36:10.360 --> 1:36:13.360]  we'll launch it midday on that Wednesday
[1:36:13.360 --> 1:36:15.360]  at prismplanet.tv in the highest quality
[1:36:15.360 --> 1:36:18.360]  there'll also be a mid-level quality DivX version
[1:36:18.360 --> 1:36:20.360]  so you can burn it on CD
[1:36:20.360 --> 1:36:24.360]  that plays on most DVD players, almost all new DVD players
[1:36:24.360 --> 1:36:27.360]  that way you can buy cheap 20, 30 cents disc
[1:36:27.360 --> 1:36:30.360]  burn copies of it, give it out to people
[1:36:30.360 --> 1:36:33.360]  not only was the Obama deception, it still is
[1:36:33.360 --> 1:36:36.360]  and we've released for free online views or people making copies of DVDs
[1:36:36.360 --> 1:36:38.360]  it's the best seller we've ever put out
[1:36:38.360 --> 1:36:40.360]  it was out of the park into the yard
[1:36:40.360 --> 1:36:43.360]  I wanted this to be a grand slam
[1:36:43.360 --> 1:36:45.360]  infowars.com
[1:36:45.360 --> 1:36:49.360]  prismplanet.tv or 888-253-3139
[1:36:49.360 --> 1:36:52.360]  you can also write to me at P.O. Box 19-549
[1:36:52.360 --> 1:36:55.360]  Austin, Texas 787-60
[1:36:55.360 --> 1:36:57.360]  it's 1995 per copy
[1:36:57.360 --> 1:37:00.360]  you're free to make copies for non-profit educational purposes
[1:37:00.360 --> 1:37:04.360]  you are not free to sell it
[1:37:04.360 --> 1:37:06.360]  and it's a good thing I made that stipulation
[1:37:06.360 --> 1:37:08.360]  Amazon will not let me open a shopping cart
[1:37:08.360 --> 1:37:10.360]  and sell my previous films
[1:37:10.360 --> 1:37:13.360]  because other people have opened carts and claim they own my films
[1:37:13.360 --> 1:37:15.360]  and I may have to litigate those people
[1:37:15.360 --> 1:37:17.360]  because they're not stopping or I lose my films
[1:37:17.360 --> 1:37:19.360]  I mean, I try to say here it is, make copies
[1:37:19.360 --> 1:37:21.360]  and then people try to take the films from me
[1:37:21.360 --> 1:37:23.360]  I know folks have tried that with David
[1:37:23.360 --> 1:37:25.360]  all I want to do is get my films out
[1:37:25.360 --> 1:37:27.360]  and have them seen by people
[1:37:27.360 --> 1:37:30.360]  but if I can't even own my own films or have my own films
[1:37:30.360 --> 1:37:33.360]  it becomes a very, very serious issue
[1:37:33.360 --> 1:37:36.360]  side issue but you know folks
[1:37:36.360 --> 1:37:39.360]  I can hang out with Hollywood people all day
[1:37:39.360 --> 1:37:43.360]  but once you know reality
[1:37:43.360 --> 1:37:45.360]  and you don't want to hang out with Hollywood people
[1:37:45.360 --> 1:37:48.360]  unless you admire their courage like Charlie Sheen
[1:37:48.360 --> 1:37:51.360]  I don't want to just hang out with them at their mansions for no reason
[1:37:51.360 --> 1:37:54.360]  I don't
[1:37:54.360 --> 1:37:57.360]  I'm less and less about the flesh, about food
[1:37:57.360 --> 1:38:00.360]  and sex and things
[1:38:00.360 --> 1:38:02.360]  and it's so liberating
[1:38:02.360 --> 1:38:05.360]  the horizons have expanded so greatly
[1:38:05.360 --> 1:38:08.360]  but how do you understand
[1:38:08.360 --> 1:38:10.360]  the limitlessness of the universe
[1:38:10.360 --> 1:38:12.360]  and how we're all tied into it
[1:38:12.360 --> 1:38:14.360]  one drop of water in the ocean is only one drop
[1:38:14.360 --> 1:38:16.360]  but it is part of the great ocean
[1:38:16.360 --> 1:38:18.360]  in its different permutations it will
[1:38:18.360 --> 1:38:20.360]  experience the ocean
[1:38:20.360 --> 1:38:22.360]  it will be in so many other life forms
[1:38:22.360 --> 1:38:24.360]  there's this limitlessness
[1:38:24.360 --> 1:38:27.360]  how do you experience that limitlessness
[1:38:27.360 --> 1:38:30.360]  but at the same time stay in this three-dimensional realm
[1:38:30.360 --> 1:38:32.360]  and fight the tyranny
[1:38:32.360 --> 1:38:34.360]  that's a question I have for David
[1:38:34.360 --> 1:38:36.360]  I could have a lot of quick questions for you now
[1:38:36.360 --> 1:38:38.360]  because I want to cover a lot of ground with you
[1:38:38.360 --> 1:38:40.360]  and pick your brain here today
[1:38:40.360 --> 1:38:42.360]  but how do you not become like some of the folks
[1:38:42.360 --> 1:38:44.360]  in India who just say so what if my kid dies
[1:38:44.360 --> 1:38:46.360]  so what if bad things happen
[1:38:46.360 --> 1:38:48.360]  you know it's all part of the limitlessness
[1:38:48.360 --> 1:38:50.360]  so you just float away into space
[1:38:50.360 --> 1:38:52.360]  this is another cop out
[1:38:52.360 --> 1:38:54.360]  the phony Rockefeller churches
[1:38:54.360 --> 1:38:56.360]  world council, national council of churches
[1:38:56.360 --> 1:38:58.360]  openly bragging that
[1:38:58.360 --> 1:39:00.360]  they teach the Christians lay down
[1:39:00.360 --> 1:39:02.360]  submit to tyranny you can't change anything
[1:39:02.360 --> 1:39:04.360]  you're going to be teleported out
[1:39:04.360 --> 1:39:06.360]  by Captain Kirk and the rapture
[1:39:06.360 --> 1:39:08.360]  though that's not even in the bible
[1:39:08.360 --> 1:39:10.360]  a pre-tribulation rapture as you said
[1:39:10.360 --> 1:39:12.360]  we've got to fight this tyranny now
[1:39:12.360 --> 1:39:14.360]  as this great battle
[1:39:14.360 --> 1:39:16.360]  comes to fruition so that we can
[1:39:16.360 --> 1:39:18.360]  bypass much of the pain and suffering
[1:39:18.360 --> 1:39:20.360]  it's going to be bad
[1:39:20.360 --> 1:39:22.360]  but everything we do now charts the course
[1:39:22.360 --> 1:39:24.360]  of future human destiny
[1:39:24.360 --> 1:39:26.360]  how do we get people to tune into the fact
[1:39:26.360 --> 1:39:28.360]  that the great decision is being made
[1:39:28.360 --> 1:39:30.360]  the greatest crossroads
[1:39:30.360 --> 1:39:32.360]  in human history
[1:39:32.360 --> 1:39:34.360]  and deciding our future destiny
[1:39:34.360 --> 1:39:36.360]  we hold humanity's destiny in our hands
[1:39:36.360 --> 1:39:38.360]  how do we
[1:39:38.360 --> 1:39:40.360]  make that decision
[1:39:40.360 --> 1:39:42.360]  how do we get people to take part
[1:39:42.360 --> 1:39:44.360]  because now I don't even hate
[1:39:44.360 --> 1:39:46.360]  the evil globalists I don't like them
[1:39:46.360 --> 1:39:48.360]  before I really hated them
[1:39:48.360 --> 1:39:50.360]  and had wrath towards them and I still do
[1:39:50.360 --> 1:39:52.360]  but more and more I feel sorry
[1:39:52.360 --> 1:39:54.360]  for them and their minions
[1:39:54.360 --> 1:39:56.360]  who are missing out on this
[1:39:56.360 --> 1:39:58.360]  great
[1:39:58.360 --> 1:40:00.360]  paradigm
[1:40:00.360 --> 1:40:02.360]  well first of all Alex they're pathetic
[1:40:02.360 --> 1:40:04.360]  they're pathetic little control freaks
[1:40:04.360 --> 1:40:06.360]  why are they control freaks
[1:40:06.360 --> 1:40:08.360]  what is a control freak
[1:40:08.360 --> 1:40:10.360]  it's a terrified frightened person
[1:40:10.360 --> 1:40:12.360]  because those that wish
[1:40:12.360 --> 1:40:14.360]  to control everything
[1:40:14.360 --> 1:40:16.360]  are seeking to control it
[1:40:16.360 --> 1:40:18.360]  because they're terrified of
[1:40:18.360 --> 1:40:20.360]  anything being in a state of flux
[1:40:20.360 --> 1:40:22.360]  these people couldn't watch
[1:40:22.360 --> 1:40:24.360]  a football match
[1:40:24.360 --> 1:40:26.360]  without making sure they knew the result
[1:40:26.360 --> 1:40:28.360]  before the game started
[1:40:28.360 --> 1:40:30.360]  because this is why
[1:40:30.360 --> 1:40:32.360]  they say in their own writings that
[1:40:32.360 --> 1:40:34.360]  one of the things that could bring them down
[1:40:34.360 --> 1:40:36.360]  is mavericks
[1:40:36.360 --> 1:40:38.360]  because mavericks just flow
[1:40:38.360 --> 1:40:40.360]  and they don't
[1:40:40.360 --> 1:40:42.360]  get
[1:40:42.360 --> 1:40:44.360]  in fear of things
[1:40:44.360 --> 1:40:46.360]  just happening as they happen
[1:40:46.360 --> 1:40:48.360]  so they're terrified
[1:40:48.360 --> 1:40:50.360]  they want to control everything
[1:40:50.360 --> 1:40:52.360]  because they're terrified of not being in control
[1:40:52.360 --> 1:40:54.360]  of everything they're pathetic
[1:40:54.360 --> 1:40:56.360]  and what
[1:40:56.360 --> 1:40:58.360]  they don't understand
[1:40:58.360 --> 1:41:00.360]  is people who
[1:41:00.360 --> 1:41:02.360]  are not looking at being attached
[1:41:02.360 --> 1:41:04.360]  to an outcome not wanting to control
[1:41:04.360 --> 1:41:06.360]  other people but just living in the moment
[1:41:06.360 --> 1:41:08.360]  they don't understand that
[1:41:08.360 --> 1:41:10.360]  and that's why they fear mavericks
[1:41:10.360 --> 1:41:12.360]  because that's what mavericks in that sense do
[1:41:12.360 --> 1:41:14.360]  in terms of
[1:41:14.360 --> 1:41:16.360]  what you were saying earlier about
[1:41:16.360 --> 1:41:18.360]  what we're all consciousness
[1:41:18.360 --> 1:41:20.360]  and it's just an experience
[1:41:20.360 --> 1:41:22.360]  so it doesn't matter
[1:41:22.360 --> 1:41:24.360]  the question comes, yes it is just an experience
[1:41:24.360 --> 1:41:26.360]  but do you want a nice experience
[1:41:26.360 --> 1:41:28.360]  do you want your children to go through
[1:41:28.360 --> 1:41:30.360]  a terrible experience
[1:41:30.360 --> 1:41:32.360]  do you want them to have their freedom
[1:41:32.360 --> 1:41:34.360]  to express themselves, deny it
[1:41:34.360 --> 1:41:36.360]  do you want them to have them come down
[1:41:36.360 --> 1:41:38.360]  through drugs
[1:41:38.360 --> 1:41:40.360]  do you want them to
[1:41:40.360 --> 1:41:42.360]  be controlled
[1:41:42.360 --> 1:41:44.360]  every minute of the day including eventually
[1:41:44.360 --> 1:41:46.360]  their thoughts, their very thoughts
[1:41:46.360 --> 1:41:48.360]  well do you want that, no
[1:41:48.360 --> 1:41:50.360]  so I ain't lying down because I don't want my kids
[1:41:50.360 --> 1:41:52.360]  or any other kids or any adults to go through
[1:41:52.360 --> 1:41:54.360]  that, I won't go through it myself
[1:41:54.360 --> 1:41:56.360]  but more than that though at the spiritual level
[1:41:56.360 --> 1:41:58.360]  the establishment
[1:41:58.360 --> 1:42:00.360]  is manifesting their Hellraiser
[1:42:00.360 --> 1:42:02.360]  type
[1:42:02.360 --> 1:42:04.360]  world here in the third dimension
[1:42:04.360 --> 1:42:06.360]  they are manifesting
[1:42:06.360 --> 1:42:08.360]  this hellish system
[1:42:08.360 --> 1:42:10.360]  this is our test
[1:42:10.360 --> 1:42:12.360]  we are being tested of what we really are
[1:42:12.360 --> 1:42:14.360]  and we're making a decision about
[1:42:14.360 --> 1:42:16.360]  what we are in eternity
[1:42:16.360 --> 1:42:18.360]  aren't we?
[1:42:18.360 --> 1:42:20.360]  what's important
[1:42:20.360 --> 1:42:22.360]  is what I said earlier to move our point
[1:42:22.360 --> 1:42:24.360]  of self-identity
[1:42:24.360 --> 1:42:26.360]  from I am Charlie Jones to I am consciousness
[1:42:26.360 --> 1:42:28.360]  have an experience of Charlie Jones
[1:42:28.360 --> 1:42:30.360]  the reason for that, crucially now Alex
[1:42:30.360 --> 1:42:32.360]  is because we're entering a period
[1:42:32.360 --> 1:42:34.360]  where they're going to throw everything at us
[1:42:34.360 --> 1:42:36.360]  you know
[1:42:36.360 --> 1:42:38.360]  not just the kitchen sink as we say
[1:42:38.360 --> 1:42:40.360]  but the plug as well
[1:42:40.360 --> 1:42:42.360]  and if we get caught in the five senses
[1:42:42.360 --> 1:42:44.360]  if we're in this world and of this world
[1:42:44.360 --> 1:42:46.360]  and this is our only sense of reality
[1:42:46.360 --> 1:42:48.360]  it's going to be
[1:42:48.360 --> 1:42:50.360]  very very challenging
[1:42:50.360 --> 1:42:52.360]  to say the very least
[1:42:52.360 --> 1:42:54.360]  if we move our point of observing it
[1:42:54.360 --> 1:42:56.360]  it's an experience
[1:42:56.360 --> 1:42:58.360]  it's still going to be challenging but it's completely changing everything
[1:42:58.360 --> 1:43:00.360]  you know I've got a quote here
[1:43:00.360 --> 1:43:02.360]  from someone who had a near-death experience
[1:43:02.360 --> 1:43:04.360]  what is a near-death experience?
[1:43:04.360 --> 1:43:06.360]  it's when that awareness
[1:43:06.360 --> 1:43:08.360]  which is what we are
[1:43:08.360 --> 1:43:10.360]  the eternal part of us
[1:43:10.360 --> 1:43:12.360]  withdraws from the computer mind
[1:43:12.360 --> 1:43:14.360]  interface
[1:43:14.360 --> 1:43:16.360]  during a near-death experience
[1:43:16.360 --> 1:43:18.360]  and suddenly what they say is
[1:43:18.360 --> 1:43:20.360]  there's a massive expansion of awareness
[1:43:20.360 --> 1:43:22.360]  and consciousness, why?
[1:43:22.360 --> 1:43:24.360]  because you're not being subject to the limitations
[1:43:24.360 --> 1:43:26.360]  of the computer anymore
[1:43:26.360 --> 1:43:28.360]  and this is what the man said he experienced
[1:43:28.360 --> 1:43:30.360]  and this is who we are
[1:43:30.360 --> 1:43:32.360]  beginning, my birth, my ancestors
[1:43:32.360 --> 1:43:34.360]  my children, my wife
[1:43:34.360 --> 1:43:36.360]  everything comes together simultaneously
[1:43:36.360 --> 1:43:38.360]  I saw everything about me
[1:43:38.360 --> 1:43:40.360]  and about everyone who was around me
[1:43:40.360 --> 1:43:42.360]  I saw everything they were thinking
[1:43:42.360 --> 1:43:44.360]  now, what they thought then
[1:43:44.360 --> 1:43:46.360]  what was happening before, what was happening now
[1:43:46.360 --> 1:43:48.360]  there is no time, there is no sequence of events
[1:43:48.360 --> 1:43:50.360]  no such thing as limitation
[1:43:50.360 --> 1:43:52.360]  a distance, a period
[1:43:52.360 --> 1:43:54.360]  of time, of place
[1:43:54.360 --> 1:43:56.360]  I could be anywhere I wanted to be
[1:43:56.360 --> 1:43:58.360]  simultaneously
[1:43:58.360 --> 1:44:00.360]  but what I'm describing is who we really are
[1:44:00.360 --> 1:44:02.360]  Alex
[1:44:02.360 --> 1:44:04.360]  and can you imagine if you're a control system
[1:44:04.360 --> 1:44:06.360]  and you want to control humanity
[1:44:06.360 --> 1:44:08.360]  or mass
[1:44:08.360 --> 1:44:10.360]  can you imagine how terrified you would be
[1:44:10.360 --> 1:44:12.360]  of people realizing that's who they are
[1:44:12.360 --> 1:44:14.360]  you control systems over
[1:44:14.360 --> 1:44:16.360]  you have to make them think
[1:44:16.360 --> 1:44:18.360]  that they're powerless little
[1:44:18.360 --> 1:44:20.360]  means and if we can move
[1:44:20.360 --> 1:44:22.360]  our self-identity, our observation
[1:44:22.360 --> 1:44:24.360]  of this reality to that level of who we are
[1:44:24.360 --> 1:44:26.360]  suddenly
[1:44:26.360 --> 1:44:28.360]  not only do we take our power back
[1:44:28.360 --> 1:44:30.360]  and start to manifest what we call miracles
[1:44:30.360 --> 1:44:32.360]  which are not miracles at all, they're just
[1:44:32.360 --> 1:44:34.360]  possibility manifesting itself
[1:44:34.360 --> 1:44:36.360]  because we understand now it's possible
[1:44:36.360 --> 1:44:38.360]  but it also will get us through this
[1:44:38.360 --> 1:44:40.360]  experience in a much
[1:44:40.360 --> 1:44:42.360]  smoother way than it would
[1:44:42.360 --> 1:44:44.360]  if we get caught in my body
[1:44:44.360 --> 1:44:46.360]  in my name and all that stuff
[1:44:46.360 --> 1:44:48.360]  David, let me throw two points out at you
[1:44:48.360 --> 1:44:50.360]  along that line and get your response
[1:44:50.360 --> 1:44:52.360]  and I do want to run through a bunch of separate points
[1:44:52.360 --> 1:44:54.360]  and get your quick response
[1:44:54.360 --> 1:44:56.360]  to those
[1:44:56.360 --> 1:44:58.360]  it's very humbling
[1:44:58.360 --> 1:45:00.360]  throughout my life
[1:45:00.360 --> 1:45:02.360]  very early on
[1:45:02.360 --> 1:45:04.360]  and I know everyone is having this experience
[1:45:04.360 --> 1:45:06.360]  I'm going to make that point, this is nothing
[1:45:06.360 --> 1:45:08.360]  special, it's I guess
[1:45:08.360 --> 1:45:10.360]  just special in how this information
[1:45:10.360 --> 1:45:12.360]  manifests and the choices I've made
[1:45:12.360 --> 1:45:14.360]  destiny
[1:45:14.360 --> 1:45:16.360]  in how many people I'm
[1:45:16.360 --> 1:45:18.360]  now reaching but I've always
[1:45:18.360 --> 1:45:20.360]  had a love affair with creation
[1:45:20.360 --> 1:45:22.360]  and humanity and goodness and love
[1:45:22.360 --> 1:45:24.360]  and beauty
[1:45:24.360 --> 1:45:26.360]  and I always
[1:45:26.360 --> 1:45:28.360]  didn't have
[1:45:28.360 --> 1:45:30.360]  the experience of
[1:45:30.360 --> 1:45:32.360]  who I was my entire life, my ancestors
[1:45:32.360 --> 1:45:34.360]  who people are
[1:45:34.360 --> 1:45:36.360]  where they came from
[1:45:36.360 --> 1:45:38.360]  but I could see shadows of that
[1:45:38.360 --> 1:45:40.360]  and then now
[1:45:40.360 --> 1:45:42.360]  you talk about being overwhelmed for three months
[1:45:42.360 --> 1:45:44.360]  now I am like that
[1:45:44.360 --> 1:45:46.360]  every day before I go to bed at night
[1:45:46.360 --> 1:45:48.360]  and I literally lay there
[1:45:48.360 --> 1:45:50.360]  with my limited
[1:45:50.360 --> 1:45:52.360]  consciousness and focus being able to
[1:45:52.360 --> 1:45:54.360]  peer into this window and look into that window
[1:45:54.360 --> 1:45:56.360]  and open this box
[1:45:56.360 --> 1:45:58.360]  and expand into this area
[1:45:58.360 --> 1:46:00.360]  and it's accurate and it's real
[1:46:00.360 --> 1:46:02.360]  and now
[1:46:02.360 --> 1:46:04.360]  I look at an incredibly beautiful woman
[1:46:04.360 --> 1:46:06.360]  or I look at some
[1:46:06.360 --> 1:46:08.360]  hunchback disheveled cleaning person
[1:46:08.360 --> 1:46:10.360]  it doesn't matter and I see
[1:46:10.360 --> 1:46:12.360]  the beauty of the species
[1:46:12.360 --> 1:46:14.360]  I literally, that's how I see them
[1:46:14.360 --> 1:46:16.360]  as their ancestors, their struggles
[1:46:16.360 --> 1:46:18.360]  the good, the bad, the ugly
[1:46:18.360 --> 1:46:20.360]  the tumults
[1:46:20.360 --> 1:46:22.360]  the great exertions, the great failures
[1:46:22.360 --> 1:46:24.360]  the great victories, I realize I'm connected
[1:46:24.360 --> 1:46:26.360]  to everyone
[1:46:26.360 --> 1:46:28.360]  and it accelerates to a point
[1:46:28.360 --> 1:46:30.360]  of where I do
[1:46:30.360 --> 1:46:32.360]  have to struggle
[1:46:32.360 --> 1:46:34.360]  just to not close down shop
[1:46:34.360 --> 1:46:36.360]  move to the country
[1:46:36.360 --> 1:46:38.360]  and literally sit under the tree
[1:46:38.360 --> 1:46:40.360]  because I'm more and more drawn to that
[1:46:40.360 --> 1:46:42.360]  but then I also am also
[1:46:42.360 --> 1:46:44.360]  separately just as passionately
[1:46:44.360 --> 1:46:46.360]  drawn towards resisting
[1:46:46.360 --> 1:46:48.360]  the globalist and meeting them
[1:46:48.360 --> 1:46:50.360]  and facing them and then I feel
[1:46:50.360 --> 1:46:52.360]  the strength of humanity
[1:46:52.360 --> 1:46:54.360]  and then I begin to envision our destiny
[1:46:54.360 --> 1:46:56.360]  and I just
[1:46:56.360 --> 1:46:58.360]  wish that other people could see it
[1:46:58.360 --> 1:47:00.360]  so that they wouldn't be destroyed
[1:47:00.360 --> 1:47:02.360]  and wouldn't be part of this system
[1:47:02.360 --> 1:47:04.360]  and wouldn't be
[1:47:04.360 --> 1:47:06.360]  taken over by this metastasizing
[1:47:06.360 --> 1:47:08.360]  counterfeit
[1:47:08.360 --> 1:47:10.360]  as they admit they're using Google
[1:47:10.360 --> 1:47:12.360]  and the technocracy so they can play God
[1:47:12.360 --> 1:47:14.360]  and predictive systems
[1:47:14.360 --> 1:47:16.360]  and algorithms to know what we're going to do
[1:47:16.360 --> 1:47:18.360]  and what our tastes are and who we are
[1:47:18.360 --> 1:47:20.360]  and it just all
[1:47:20.360 --> 1:47:22.360]  it's like trying to drink out a lick
[1:47:22.360 --> 1:47:24.360]  superior with a pixie straw
[1:47:24.360 --> 1:47:26.360]  Yeah, I've got a quote
[1:47:26.360 --> 1:47:28.360]  from Einstein who to a very
[1:47:28.360 --> 1:47:30.360]  large extent had
[1:47:30.360 --> 1:47:32.360]  a lot of things
[1:47:32.360 --> 1:47:34.360]  and he talked about
[1:47:34.360 --> 1:47:36.360]  the delusion
[1:47:36.360 --> 1:47:38.360]  he called reality an illusion
[1:47:38.360 --> 1:47:40.360]  albeit a persistent one
[1:47:40.360 --> 1:47:42.360]  but it's a persistent one because we keep
[1:47:42.360 --> 1:47:44.360]  coding it out of the
[1:47:44.360 --> 1:47:46.360]  wireless internet and I'm talking about
[1:47:46.360 --> 1:47:48.360]  he keeps on coming
[1:47:48.360 --> 1:47:50.360]  this delusion is a kind of prison for us
[1:47:50.360 --> 1:47:52.360]  restricting us to our personal
[1:47:52.360 --> 1:47:54.360]  desires and to affection for a few
[1:47:54.360 --> 1:47:56.360]  persons nearest to us
[1:47:56.360 --> 1:47:58.360]  our task must be to free ourselves from this prison
[1:47:58.360 --> 1:48:00.360]  by widening our circle of compassion
[1:48:00.360 --> 1:48:02.360]  to embrace all living creatures
[1:48:02.360 --> 1:48:04.360]  and the whole of nature in its beauty
[1:48:04.360 --> 1:48:06.360]  and that's what kind of happens as you
[1:48:06.360 --> 1:48:08.360]  open your mind
[1:48:08.360 --> 1:48:10.360]  it's literally opening your mind
[1:48:10.360 --> 1:48:12.360]  and what's wrong with mind is the interface
[1:48:12.360 --> 1:48:14.360]  it's like saying something wrong with a computer
[1:48:14.360 --> 1:48:16.360]  when you're going on the internet
[1:48:16.360 --> 1:48:18.360]  but it has to take its place
[1:48:18.360 --> 1:48:20.360]  to serve consciousness and serve the experience
[1:48:20.360 --> 1:48:22.360]  and not be the governor
[1:48:22.360 --> 1:48:24.360]  and as you kind of do that
[1:48:24.360 --> 1:48:26.360]  you do
[1:48:26.360 --> 1:48:28.360]  widen your
[1:48:28.360 --> 1:48:30.360]  circle of compassion
[1:48:30.360 --> 1:48:32.360]  and from the people
[1:48:32.360 --> 1:48:34.360]  immediately around you
[1:48:34.360 --> 1:48:36.360]  because you start to realize
[1:48:36.360 --> 1:48:38.360]  that you are the ocean
[1:48:38.360 --> 1:48:40.360]  they want us to believe we're a droplet
[1:48:40.360 --> 1:48:42.360]  because we're just a droplet what can we do
[1:48:42.360 --> 1:48:44.360]  well that was my point the droplet is the ocean
[1:48:44.360 --> 1:48:46.360]  access the ocean I mean
[1:48:46.360 --> 1:48:48.360]  it's all over and so
[1:48:48.360 --> 1:48:50.360]  this awakening
[1:48:50.360 --> 1:48:52.360]  is going to
[1:48:52.360 --> 1:48:54.360]  as this control system comes down
[1:48:54.360 --> 1:48:56.360]  it is literally going to transform
[1:48:56.360 --> 1:48:58.360]  this world into what we would call
[1:48:58.360 --> 1:49:00.360]  now utopia it's not utopia
[1:49:00.360 --> 1:49:02.360]  it's a natural state
[1:49:02.360 --> 1:49:04.360]  I use this analogy
[1:49:04.360 --> 1:49:06.360]  in my talks about
[1:49:06.360 --> 1:49:08.360]  how amazing we really are
[1:49:08.360 --> 1:49:10.360]  if you want to
[1:49:10.360 --> 1:49:12.360]  if you want to
[1:49:12.360 --> 1:49:14.360]  if you've got a ball
[1:49:14.360 --> 1:49:16.360]  in a tank of water
[1:49:16.360 --> 1:49:18.360]  its natural state is floating on the top of the tank
[1:49:18.360 --> 1:49:20.360]  to put it in an unnatural state
[1:49:20.360 --> 1:49:22.360]  which is what this control system has done to humanity
[1:49:22.360 --> 1:49:24.360]  you have to push the ball
[1:49:24.360 --> 1:49:26.360]  to the bottom of the tank and you have to hold it there
[1:49:26.360 --> 1:49:28.360]  you can't let go because
[1:49:28.360 --> 1:49:30.360]  it's in its natural state in a second
[1:49:30.360 --> 1:49:32.360]  and so the back seas
[1:49:32.360 --> 1:49:34.360]  the water the television
[1:49:34.360 --> 1:49:36.360]  throw everything at us
[1:49:36.360 --> 1:49:38.360]  including destabilizing our body computer
[1:49:38.360 --> 1:49:40.360]  receive a transmitter system
[1:49:40.360 --> 1:49:42.360]  through the additives in food and drink
[1:49:42.360 --> 1:49:44.360]  they have to program us
[1:49:44.360 --> 1:49:46.360]  in the way we talked about earlier through the education system
[1:49:46.360 --> 1:49:48.360]  and the media all these things
[1:49:48.360 --> 1:49:50.360]  they have to do to keep us in an unnatural state
[1:49:50.360 --> 1:49:52.360]  that's how amazing we are
[1:49:52.360 --> 1:49:54.360]  are we going back to that state
[1:49:54.360 --> 1:49:56.360]  and it's coming down
[1:49:56.360 --> 1:49:58.360]  now a lot of the suicidal nihilist
[1:49:58.360 --> 1:50:00.360]  I had this in in-game
[1:50:00.360 --> 1:50:02.360]  the quotes top futurist
[1:50:02.360 --> 1:50:04.360]  developers very wealthy people
[1:50:04.360 --> 1:50:06.360]  they say
[1:50:06.360 --> 1:50:08.360]  that if we can't control the earth
[1:50:08.360 --> 1:50:10.360]  we're going to destroy it because we have to be in control
[1:50:10.360 --> 1:50:12.360]  we have to go unwilling
[1:50:12.360 --> 1:50:14.360]  and we see
[1:50:14.360 --> 1:50:16.360]  linen in his poetry about how I want to destroy the earth and sun
[1:50:16.360 --> 1:50:18.360]  they are going to
[1:50:18.360 --> 1:50:20.360]  attempt to destroy things
[1:50:20.360 --> 1:50:22.360]  as 2016
[1:50:22.360 --> 1:50:24.360]  in your view
[1:50:24.360 --> 1:50:26.360]  your vision approaches
[1:50:26.360 --> 1:50:28.360]  how are they going to try to freeze us
[1:50:28.360 --> 1:50:30.360]  we're about to go to break we're going to come back and look at that
[1:50:30.360 --> 1:50:32.360]  because
[1:50:32.360 --> 1:50:34.360]  will they be allowed to destroy the earth
[1:50:34.360 --> 1:50:36.360]  because they say they're going to kill everybody
[1:50:36.360 --> 1:50:38.360]  they'll just blow the planet into a thousand pieces
[1:50:38.360 --> 1:50:40.360]  if we attempt to take control of it from them
[1:50:40.360 --> 1:50:42.360]  by simply
[1:50:42.360 --> 1:50:44.360]  no longer being under their control
[1:50:44.360 --> 1:50:46.360]  and then I want to get into all this news
[1:50:48.360 --> 1:50:50.360]  about world government
[1:50:50.360 --> 1:50:52.360]  and what's happening with
[1:50:52.360 --> 1:50:54.360]  all these satanists
[1:50:54.360 --> 1:50:56.360]  openly announcing
[1:50:56.360 --> 1:50:58.360]  the different things they're doing

[1:54:30.360 --> 1:54:32.360]  we're going to be covering
[1:54:34.360 --> 1:54:36.360]  David I went over an article
[1:54:36.360 --> 1:54:38.360]  written for infowars.com
[1:54:38.360 --> 1:54:40.360]  called The Real Sicko Movie
[1:54:40.360 --> 1:54:42.360]  and it talks about
[1:54:42.360 --> 1:54:44.360]  Roman Polanski
[1:54:44.360 --> 1:54:46.360]  raping that little 13-year-old girl
[1:54:46.360 --> 1:54:48.360]  and how Nicholas Arcozy and all these stars
[1:54:48.360 --> 1:54:50.360]  are saying it's not a big deal
[1:54:50.360 --> 1:54:52.360]  but then they're the ones pushing CPS
[1:54:52.360 --> 1:54:54.360]  laws where if you yell at your child
[1:54:54.360 --> 1:54:56.360]  when they run out in the street
[1:54:56.360 --> 1:54:58.360]  they take your children away
[1:54:58.360 --> 1:55:00.360]  so they're always saying oh we love you so much
[1:55:00.360 --> 1:55:02.360]  we want to take all your rights
[1:55:02.360 --> 1:55:04.360]  but then we're going to rape children
[1:55:04.360 --> 1:55:06.360]  the head of France's arts
[1:55:06.360 --> 1:55:08.360]  number three position in the cabinet
[1:55:08.360 --> 1:55:10.360]  is the
[1:55:10.360 --> 1:55:12.360]  relative of Francois Mitterrand
[1:55:12.360 --> 1:55:14.360]  he's Frederick Mitterrand
[1:55:14.360 --> 1:55:16.360]  and he wrote a book
[1:55:16.360 --> 1:55:18.360]  and he's the current culture minister
[1:55:18.360 --> 1:55:20.360]  talking about how he goes to slave camps
[1:55:20.360 --> 1:55:22.360]  and rapes little boys
[1:55:22.360 --> 1:55:24.360]  and dead people and at a Rothschild castle
[1:55:24.360 --> 1:55:26.360]  back in 1999
[1:55:26.360 --> 1:55:28.360]  a woman escaped who was 85 pounds
[1:55:28.360 --> 1:55:30.360]  87 pounds and a police did nothing
[1:55:30.360 --> 1:55:32.360]  you've studied the ritual
[1:55:32.360 --> 1:55:34.360]  Satanism it's very real
[1:55:34.360 --> 1:55:36.360]  and you don't even come from this
[1:55:36.360 --> 1:55:38.360]  every time I talk about the occultist
[1:55:38.360 --> 1:55:40.360]  they email me and say oh how dare you Christian
[1:55:40.360 --> 1:55:42.360]  we're the old time religion
[1:55:42.360 --> 1:55:44.360]  we predate you we're not sacrificing
[1:55:44.360 --> 1:55:46.360]  anybody but we know that's what they really do
[1:55:46.360 --> 1:55:48.360]  do they're always being caught doing it
[1:55:48.360 --> 1:55:50.360]  and now you have out in the open
[1:55:50.360 --> 1:55:52.360]  the head of France's
[1:55:52.360 --> 1:55:54.360]  arts saying yes
[1:55:54.360 --> 1:55:56.360]  I rape children and I'm allowed to
[1:55:56.360 --> 1:55:58.360]  and it's wonderful and I love raping them
[1:55:58.360 --> 1:56:00.360]  so this isn't just about
[1:56:00.360 --> 1:56:02.360]  why they do this
[1:56:02.360 --> 1:56:04.360]  it's also they're throwing it in our face
[1:56:04.360 --> 1:56:06.360]  by doing it out in the open and the CIA
[1:56:06.360 --> 1:56:08.360]  admitting they torture people and Obama saying
[1:56:08.360 --> 1:56:10.360]  he's going to continue it
[1:56:10.360 --> 1:56:12.360]  including the rape of children at Abu Ghraib
[1:56:12.360 --> 1:56:14.360]  with large objects dripping with battery acid
[1:56:14.360 --> 1:56:16.360]  that's the army's own report and it goes on and on from there
[1:56:16.360 --> 1:56:18.360]  they are trying to superimpose
[1:56:18.360 --> 1:56:20.360]  superimpose that on us
[1:56:20.360 --> 1:56:22.360]  and create a climate where that is normal
[1:56:22.360 --> 1:56:24.360]  why are they doing this
[1:56:24.360 --> 1:56:26.360]  well you know
[1:56:26.360 --> 1:56:28.360]  it's part of the programming
[1:56:28.360 --> 1:56:30.360]  to bring the
[1:56:30.360 --> 1:56:32.360]  horrors that they have done
[1:56:32.360 --> 1:56:34.360]  in secret up to this point
[1:56:34.360 --> 1:56:36.360]  to bring it more and more into
[1:56:36.360 --> 1:56:38.360]  acceptability
[1:56:38.360 --> 1:56:40.360]  and they'll be
[1:56:40.360 --> 1:56:42.360]  bringing this more and more to the fore
[1:56:42.360 --> 1:56:44.360]  because what you just described
[1:56:44.360 --> 1:56:46.360]  they want to bring this into the mainstream
[1:56:46.360 --> 1:56:48.360]  eventually
[1:56:48.360 --> 1:56:50.360]  but talking about Roman Polanski
[1:56:50.360 --> 1:56:52.360]  because I have done an enormous amount of research
[1:56:52.360 --> 1:56:54.360]  into this whole area that you just talked about
[1:56:54.360 --> 1:56:56.360]  Roman Polanski is a practicing satanist
[1:56:56.360 --> 1:56:58.360]  he's been a practicing satanist
[1:56:58.360 --> 1:57:00.360]  all the way through his
[1:57:00.360 --> 1:57:02.360]  his career
[1:57:02.360 --> 1:57:04.360]  and all that stuff
[1:57:04.360 --> 1:57:06.360]  what happened with Charles Manson
[1:57:06.360 --> 1:57:08.360]  and his wife and the family
[1:57:08.360 --> 1:57:10.360]  and all that stuff was all connected into it
[1:57:10.360 --> 1:57:12.360]  and
[1:57:12.360 --> 1:57:14.360]  whenever I follow these people
[1:57:14.360 --> 1:57:16.360]  the Rothschilds
[1:57:16.360 --> 1:57:18.360]  people like the Bush family
[1:57:18.360 --> 1:57:20.360]  particularly Father George Bush by the way
[1:57:20.360 --> 1:57:22.360]  and I follow them through
[1:57:22.360 --> 1:57:24.360]  they always
[1:57:24.360 --> 1:57:26.360]  lead to the same place
[1:57:26.360 --> 1:57:28.360]  which is racial sacrifice
[1:57:28.360 --> 1:57:30.360]  satanism and child abuse
[1:57:30.360 --> 1:57:32.360]  sexual abuse and one of the things that they're doing
[1:57:32.360 --> 1:57:34.360]  which
[1:57:34.360 --> 1:57:36.360]  they are feeding off
[1:57:36.360 --> 1:57:38.360]  the child's energy
[1:57:38.360 --> 1:57:40.360]  and what they want
[1:57:40.360 --> 1:57:42.360]  is the child
[1:57:42.360 --> 1:57:44.360]  before puberty
[1:57:44.360 --> 1:57:46.360]  because when people go through puberty as we know
[1:57:46.360 --> 1:57:48.360]  there are chemical changes that take place
[1:57:48.360 --> 1:57:50.360]  they want the energy of the child
[1:57:50.360 --> 1:57:52.360]  before that chemical change
[1:57:52.360 --> 1:57:54.360]  happens and so they
[1:57:54.360 --> 1:57:56.360]  rape children
[1:57:56.360 --> 1:57:58.360]  and in doing so they're literally
[1:57:58.360 --> 1:58:00.360]  sucking their energy out of them
[1:58:00.360 --> 1:58:02.360]  their life force
[1:58:02.360 --> 1:58:04.360]  that's the word
[1:58:04.360 --> 1:58:06.360]  by the way let me stop you
[1:58:06.360 --> 1:58:08.360]  I know so much more about this now
[1:58:08.360 --> 1:58:10.360]  after the last few weeks
[1:58:10.360 --> 1:58:12.360]  they are
[1:58:12.360 --> 1:58:14.360]  possessed by entities
[1:58:14.360 --> 1:58:16.360]  that operate just outside of visible light
[1:58:16.360 --> 1:58:18.360]  these are the demons
[1:58:18.360 --> 1:58:20.360]  under other names that people have talked about
[1:58:20.360 --> 1:58:22.360]  and religions and ancient texts have talked about
[1:58:22.360 --> 1:58:24.360]  and these
[1:58:24.360 --> 1:58:26.360]  demonic entities
[1:58:26.360 --> 1:58:28.360]  they feed off human energy
[1:58:28.360 --> 1:58:30.360]  they feed off the child's energy
[1:58:30.360 --> 1:58:32.360]  because they're possessing the rate test
[1:58:32.360 --> 1:58:34.360]  if you like of the child
[1:58:34.360 --> 1:58:36.360]  David I don't want to interrupt you but we've got to for the break
[1:58:36.360 --> 1:58:38.360]  that's what Frederick Mitterrand says in here
[1:58:38.360 --> 1:58:40.360]  he calls it a ritual

[1:59:16.360 --> 1:59:18.360]  is a low cost way to take back control
[1:59:18.360 --> 1:59:20.360]  of you and your families drinking water

[1:59:24.360 --> 1:59:26.360]  and uses state of the art carbon filtration
[1:59:26.360 --> 1:59:28.360]  reverse osmosis
[1:59:28.360 --> 1:59:30.360]  and ultra violent light sterilization techniques
[1:59:30.360 --> 1:59:32.360]  that's right clean water
[1:59:32.360 --> 1:59:34.360]  right from the air you breathe

[1:59:48.360 --> 2:00:14.360]  at www.ecolovle.com
[2:00:18.360 --> 2:00:20.360]  live from Austin Texas
[2:00:20.360 --> 2:00:22.360]  Alex Jones
[2:00:26.360 --> 2:00:28.360]  so we have this nephew
[2:00:28.360 --> 2:00:30.360]  of the late French resident
[2:00:30.360 --> 2:00:32.360]  François Mitterrand
[2:00:34.360 --> 2:00:36.360]  François Mitterrand
[2:00:36.360 --> 2:00:38.360]  openly said he was a Luciferian
[2:00:38.360 --> 2:00:40.360]  practitioner
[2:00:40.360 --> 2:00:42.360]  he designed or commissioned
[2:00:42.360 --> 2:00:44.360]  the 666 gold pieces of the pyramid
[2:00:44.360 --> 2:00:46.360]  at the Louvre
[2:00:46.360 --> 2:00:48.360]  let's punch up the Louvre pyramid
[2:00:48.360 --> 2:00:50.360]  the Louvre pyramid for folks
[2:00:50.360 --> 2:00:52.360]  just google Louvre pyramid
[2:00:52.360 --> 2:00:54.360]  and then he's got
[2:00:54.360 --> 2:00:56.360]  his family member the head
[2:00:56.360 --> 2:00:58.360]  of the French art department
[2:00:58.360 --> 2:01:00.360]  number 3 in the parliament
[2:01:00.360 --> 2:01:02.360]  in the cabinet
[2:01:02.360 --> 2:01:04.360]  appointed by Nicholas Sarkozy
[2:01:04.360 --> 2:01:06.360]  they're all defending
[2:01:06.360 --> 2:01:08.360]  Roman Polanski raping this 13 year old girl
[2:01:08.360 --> 2:01:10.360]  and he says
[2:01:10.360 --> 2:01:12.360]  hey I love doing the rituals
[2:01:12.360 --> 2:01:14.360]  with young boys
[2:01:14.360 --> 2:01:16.360]  and he goes I love raping
[2:01:16.360 --> 2:01:18.360]  I mean it goes on here
[2:01:18.360 --> 2:01:20.360]  David Ike you got cut off by the break
[2:01:20.360 --> 2:01:22.360]  continue
[2:01:22.360 --> 2:01:24.360]  well I was going to say that you know
[2:01:24.360 --> 2:01:26.360]  if you look back
[2:01:26.360 --> 2:01:28.360]  through what we call history
[2:01:28.360 --> 2:01:30.360]  you'll see this common theme
[2:01:30.360 --> 2:01:32.360]  of sacrificing
[2:01:32.360 --> 2:01:34.360]  young virgins to the gods
[2:01:34.360 --> 2:01:36.360]  all over the world
[2:01:36.360 --> 2:01:38.360]  well the gods
[2:01:38.360 --> 2:01:40.360]  code if you like
[2:01:40.360 --> 2:01:42.360]  for these demonic entities
[2:01:42.360 --> 2:01:44.360]  young virgins is
[2:01:44.360 --> 2:01:46.360]  code for children
[2:01:46.360 --> 2:01:48.360]  they were children that they were sacrificing
[2:01:48.360 --> 2:01:50.360]  and what they do in these
[2:01:50.360 --> 2:01:52.360]  satanic rituals
[2:01:52.360 --> 2:01:54.360]  is they create
[2:01:54.360 --> 2:01:56.360]  the terror of the victim
[2:01:56.360 --> 2:01:58.360]  they build up the terror
[2:01:58.360 --> 2:02:00.360]  it's all systematic
[2:02:00.360 --> 2:02:02.360]  so it reaches
[2:02:02.360 --> 2:02:04.360]  a point of absolute terror
[2:02:04.360 --> 2:02:06.360]  as it gets closer to the sacrifice
[2:02:06.360 --> 2:02:08.360]  and these
[2:02:08.360 --> 2:02:10.360]  demonic entities just outside of
[2:02:10.360 --> 2:02:12.360]  visible light but within the frequency
[2:02:12.360 --> 2:02:14.360]  range of the emotion
[2:02:14.360 --> 2:02:16.360]  of terror that's an energy
[2:02:16.360 --> 2:02:18.360]  which is being generated
[2:02:18.360 --> 2:02:20.360]  they're feeding off that
[2:02:20.360 --> 2:02:22.360]  and then at the point of sacrifice
[2:02:22.360 --> 2:02:24.360]  that terror manifests itself
[2:02:24.360 --> 2:02:26.360]  in an adrenaline
[2:02:26.360 --> 2:02:28.360]  that enters the bloodstream
[2:02:28.360 --> 2:02:30.360]  a very powerful adrenaline
[2:02:30.360 --> 2:02:32.360]  and the human satanist
[2:02:32.360 --> 2:02:34.360]  the people we're talking about
[2:02:34.360 --> 2:02:36.360]  when the child
[2:02:36.360 --> 2:02:38.360]  or the adult too
[2:02:38.360 --> 2:02:40.360]  sacrificed they drink
[2:02:40.360 --> 2:02:42.360]  the blood immediately which has
[2:02:42.360 --> 2:02:44.360]  this adrenaline which gives them some kind of high
[2:02:44.360 --> 2:02:46.360]  I mean these are the people
[2:02:46.360 --> 2:02:48.360]  Alex that are running
[2:02:48.360 --> 2:02:50.360]  governments all over the world
[2:02:50.360 --> 2:02:52.360]  that's why they're defending this satanist
[2:02:52.360 --> 2:02:54.360]  child abuser Polanski
[2:02:54.360 --> 2:02:56.360]  they're running
[2:02:56.360 --> 2:02:58.360]  the intelligence agencies
[2:02:58.360 --> 2:03:00.360]  they're running the military
[2:03:00.360 --> 2:03:02.360]  they're running the corporations
[2:03:02.360 --> 2:03:04.360]  because that
[2:03:04.360 --> 2:03:06.360]  movie by Stanley Kubrick
[2:03:06.360 --> 2:03:08.360]  got his last movie and he died
[2:03:08.360 --> 2:03:10.360]  very very soon after the
[2:03:10.360 --> 2:03:12.360]  executives of the
[2:03:12.360 --> 2:03:14.360]  movie corporation
[2:03:14.360 --> 2:03:16.360]  watched it at the first viewing
[2:03:16.360 --> 2:03:18.360]  he died very soon after
[2:03:18.360 --> 2:03:20.360]  it was more than that I remember at the time
[2:03:20.360 --> 2:03:22.360]  talking to people involved and it came
[2:03:22.360 --> 2:03:24.360]  out in the news they made him cut
[2:03:24.360 --> 2:03:26.360]  25 minutes he refused to cut it
[2:03:26.360 --> 2:03:28.360]  then he suddenly died
[2:03:28.360 --> 2:03:30.360]  and then they cut it
[2:03:30.360 --> 2:03:32.360]  we've never seen that
[2:03:32.360 --> 2:03:34.360]  film that was cut
[2:03:34.360 --> 2:03:36.360]  and yet even when you look
[2:03:36.360 --> 2:03:38.360]  at it Alex what was even left
[2:03:38.360 --> 2:03:40.360]  in he was telling the truth
[2:03:40.360 --> 2:03:42.360]  about what
[2:03:42.360 --> 2:03:44.360]  goes on with the mansion and the
[2:03:44.360 --> 2:03:46.360]  rituals except it was
[2:03:46.360 --> 2:03:48.360]  a very mild version of it
[2:03:48.360 --> 2:03:50.360]  and these are the people that are
[2:03:50.360 --> 2:03:52.360]  running the world and
[2:03:52.360 --> 2:03:54.360]  it's time they weren't and
[2:03:54.360 --> 2:03:56.360]  the time is coming when they weren't
[2:03:56.360 --> 2:03:58.360]  because
[2:03:58.360 --> 2:04:00.360]  one thing I'm very very very
[2:04:00.360 --> 2:04:02.360]  aware of is that there is another
[2:04:02.360 --> 2:04:04.360]  force
[2:04:04.360 --> 2:04:06.360]  call it consciousness call it whatever you like
[2:04:06.360 --> 2:04:08.360]  there's a force that is working
[2:04:08.360 --> 2:04:10.360]  to bring an end to this
[2:04:10.360 --> 2:04:12.360]  and that's what is going
[2:04:12.360 --> 2:04:14.360]  to prevail and
[2:04:14.360 --> 2:04:16.360]  we're seeing at the moment
[2:04:16.360 --> 2:04:18.360]  we're seeing a cornered rat
[2:04:18.360 --> 2:04:20.360]  or cornered rats and
[2:04:20.360 --> 2:04:22.360]  they're going to like
[2:04:22.360 --> 2:04:24.360]  rats do when you corner them they're going to be
[2:04:24.360 --> 2:04:26.360]  thrashing out in all directions
[2:04:26.360 --> 2:04:28.360]  but that's what it is it's
[2:04:28.360 --> 2:04:30.360]  the death rows it's going to be very
[2:04:30.360 --> 2:04:32.360]  challenging for us but it's
[2:04:32.360 --> 2:04:34.360]  the death rows of this stuff
[2:04:34.360 --> 2:04:36.360]  and then
[2:04:36.360 --> 2:04:38.360]  I forgot to get you to answer that
[2:04:38.360 --> 2:04:40.360]  question they're threatening
[2:04:40.360 --> 2:04:42.360]  to destroy the planet if we try to
[2:04:42.360 --> 2:04:44.360]  take control back away from them
[2:04:44.360 --> 2:04:46.360]  or just end the control and other
[2:04:46.360 --> 2:04:48.360]  final questions for our guest David
[2:04:48.360 --> 2:04:50.360]  Eich on the other side
[2:04:50.360 --> 2:04:52.360]  and I want to be clear with people
[2:04:52.360 --> 2:04:54.360]  even if you don't believe in Satanism
[2:04:54.360 --> 2:04:56.360]  and this Luciferian bloodletting
[2:04:56.360 --> 2:04:58.360]  that's what all the elites are into
[2:04:58.360 --> 2:05:00.360]  in their own words not mine
[2:05:28.360 --> 2:05:30.360]  you'll never have to suffer through
[2:05:30.360 --> 2:05:32.360]  painful power outages again
[2:05:32.360 --> 2:05:34.360]  when the power goes out you'll be ready

[2:07:46.360 --> 2:07:48.360]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day
[2:07:48.360 --> 2:07:50.360]  call
[2:07:50.360 --> 2:07:52.360]  1-800-409-5633
[2:07:52.360 --> 2:07:54.360]  or check it out on the web
[2:07:54.360 --> 2:07:56.360]  at eFoodsDirect.com
[2:07:56.360 --> 2:07:58.360]  again that number 1-800-409-5633
[2:08:02.360 --> 2:08:04.360]  from his central Texas command center
[2:08:04.360 --> 2:08:06.360]  deep behind enemy lines
[2:08:06.360 --> 2:08:08.360]  the information war continues
[2:08:08.360 --> 2:08:10.360]  it's Alex Jones
[2:08:10.360 --> 2:08:12.360]  and the GCN radio network
[2:08:16.360 --> 2:08:18.360]  there's an old adage
[2:08:18.360 --> 2:08:20.360]  the devil's greatest trick
[2:08:20.360 --> 2:08:22.360]  was convincing the world he didn't exist
[2:08:22.360 --> 2:08:24.360]  and that's why psychopaths
[2:08:24.360 --> 2:08:26.360]  are able to pick up young women and children
[2:08:26.360 --> 2:08:28.360]  that's why dictators are able to
[2:08:28.360 --> 2:08:30.360]  rise to power that's how this
[2:08:30.360 --> 2:08:32.360]  Michael Hilton con artist could go
[2:08:32.360 --> 2:08:34.360]  take over the town and
[2:08:34.360 --> 2:08:36.360]  harden Montana
[2:08:36.360 --> 2:08:38.360]  because people don't want to admit
[2:08:38.360 --> 2:08:40.360]  they're being conned
[2:08:40.360 --> 2:08:42.360]  or that other people are taking advantage of them
[2:08:42.360 --> 2:08:44.360]  final segment with David Ike
[2:08:44.360 --> 2:08:46.360]  I want to make this point though
[2:08:46.360 --> 2:08:48.360]  just from a
[2:08:48.360 --> 2:08:50.360]  anthropology
[2:08:50.360 --> 2:08:52.360]  view
[2:08:52.360 --> 2:08:54.360]  or from the angle of archaeology
[2:08:56.360 --> 2:08:58.360]  I don't claim to be
[2:08:58.360 --> 2:09:00.360]  a historian
[2:09:00.360 --> 2:09:02.360]  but I have made a
[2:09:02.360 --> 2:09:04.360]  wide study of history it's so huge
[2:09:04.360 --> 2:09:06.360]  no one can
[2:09:06.360 --> 2:09:08.360]  even be an expert really in one area in my opinion
[2:09:08.360 --> 2:09:10.360]  it's so lengthy
[2:09:10.360 --> 2:09:12.360]  in the different interpretations of history
[2:09:12.360 --> 2:09:14.360]  but
[2:09:14.360 --> 2:09:16.360]  whether it was the Babylonians
[2:09:16.360 --> 2:09:18.360]  or whether it was the Romans
[2:09:18.360 --> 2:09:20.360]  or whether it was the Greeks
[2:09:20.360 --> 2:09:22.360]  or whether it was
[2:09:22.360 --> 2:09:24.360]  many of the Middle Eastern tribes
[2:09:24.360 --> 2:09:26.360]  Asian tribes, African tribes
[2:09:26.360 --> 2:09:28.360]  Mesoamerican tribes, the Aztecs
[2:09:28.360 --> 2:09:30.360]  they all had
[2:09:30.360 --> 2:09:32.360]  high priest
[2:09:32.360 --> 2:09:34.360]  who all followed the same secret mathematics religion
[2:09:34.360 --> 2:09:36.360]  they all worshiped the same
[2:09:36.360 --> 2:09:38.360]  snake god
[2:09:38.360 --> 2:09:40.360]  and they all demanded women
[2:09:40.360 --> 2:09:42.360]  children and men normally the most beautiful
[2:09:42.360 --> 2:09:44.360]  the most healthy
[2:09:44.360 --> 2:09:46.360]  to be sacrificed
[2:09:46.360 --> 2:09:48.360]  and the Aztecs particularly believed
[2:09:48.360 --> 2:09:50.360]  great pain had to be created
[2:09:50.360 --> 2:09:52.360]  now even the elites there
[2:09:52.360 --> 2:09:54.360]  not just children having their hearts cut out
[2:09:54.360 --> 2:09:56.360]  and cut up into meat
[2:09:56.360 --> 2:09:58.360]  that's how the priests funded themselves
[2:09:58.360 --> 2:10:00.360]  was the sale of the number one meat that was consumed
[2:10:00.360 --> 2:10:02.360]  human flesh in all of the Mayan kingdoms
[2:10:02.360 --> 2:10:04.360]  but particularly the most aberrant
[2:10:04.360 --> 2:10:06.360]  the Aztecs the most extreme
[2:10:06.360 --> 2:10:08.360]  that they would take long pieces
[2:10:08.360 --> 2:10:10.360]  of rope with glass through their tongues
[2:10:10.360 --> 2:10:12.360]  and through their genitals
[2:10:12.360 --> 2:10:14.360]  hallucinations of pain
[2:10:14.360 --> 2:10:16.360]  while taking hallucinogens
[2:10:16.360 --> 2:10:18.360]  and you see that
[2:10:18.360 --> 2:10:20.360]  in all these different cultures
[2:10:20.360 --> 2:10:22.360]  believing that they had to feed
[2:10:22.360 --> 2:10:24.360]  the snake god with the blood
[2:10:24.360 --> 2:10:26.360]  and so even if you don't believe
[2:10:26.360 --> 2:10:28.360]  in god the devil two different forces
[2:10:28.360 --> 2:10:30.360]  any of this the point is
[2:10:30.360 --> 2:10:32.360]  Tony Blair his wife
[2:10:32.360 --> 2:10:34.360]  I mean they admit Blair went all over the world
[2:10:34.360 --> 2:10:36.360]  Francois Mineron
[2:10:36.360 --> 2:10:38.360]  all of them to be possessed by the spirit
[2:10:38.360 --> 2:10:40.360]  of white light he would hit the ground every morning
[2:10:40.360 --> 2:10:42.360]  flop around that's mainstream news
[2:10:42.360 --> 2:10:44.360]  the bushes and skull and bones
[2:10:44.360 --> 2:10:46.360]  in big pits of feces
[2:10:46.360 --> 2:10:48.360]  and urine being reborn
[2:10:48.360 --> 2:10:50.360]  in homosexual orgies
[2:10:50.360 --> 2:10:52.360]  someone dresses the devil with a crown
[2:10:52.360 --> 2:10:54.360]  brings them into nights
[2:10:54.360 --> 2:10:56.360]  in Satan's service this is admitted
[2:10:56.360 --> 2:10:58.360]  and so you need to
[2:10:58.360 --> 2:11:00.360]  understand this is real even if you're an atheist
[2:11:00.360 --> 2:11:02.360]  and don't believe in anything outside
[2:11:02.360 --> 2:11:04.360]  the limited senses you have
[2:11:04.360 --> 2:11:06.360]  and you don't believe in the six senses or anything
[2:11:06.360 --> 2:11:08.360]  that have been proven in university studies
[2:11:08.360 --> 2:11:10.360]  you must know
[2:11:10.360 --> 2:11:12.360]  that the most aberrant the most destructive
[2:11:12.360 --> 2:11:14.360]  have created a kingdom of psychopathic delight
[2:11:14.360 --> 2:11:16.360]  to trample on
[2:11:16.360 --> 2:11:18.360]  and be trampled on to
[2:11:18.360 --> 2:11:20.360]  press on the nerves of power
[2:11:20.360 --> 2:11:22.360]  to humiliate innocence
[2:11:22.360 --> 2:11:24.360]  and beauty because to them
[2:11:24.360 --> 2:11:26.360]  the psychopath describes
[2:11:26.360 --> 2:11:28.360]  being in a cold horrible depressed place
[2:11:28.360 --> 2:11:30.360]  until they're torturing
[2:11:30.360 --> 2:11:32.360]  a child until they're torturing a woman
[2:11:32.360 --> 2:11:34.360]  then it's like a blazing light
[2:11:34.360 --> 2:11:36.360]  I've had the top psychiatrist on who
[2:11:36.360 --> 2:11:38.360]  interviewed hundreds of killers
[2:11:38.360 --> 2:11:40.360]  and it's all the same they are alive
[2:11:40.360 --> 2:11:42.360]  when they've got a woman shamed down
[2:11:42.360 --> 2:11:44.360]  biting chunks out of her they're alive
[2:11:44.360 --> 2:11:46.360]  Hitler was only happy he would go to the front
[2:11:46.360 --> 2:11:48.360]  and watch through high power binoculars
[2:11:48.360 --> 2:11:50.360]  burning cities and could
[2:11:50.360 --> 2:11:52.360]  stay up for days on end
[2:11:52.360 --> 2:11:54.360]  without drugs or coffee just
[2:11:54.360 --> 2:11:56.360]  just loving the death and the burning
[2:11:56.360 --> 2:11:58.360]  and the black uniforms and the armored vehicles
[2:11:58.360 --> 2:12:00.360]  this is the spirit
[2:12:00.360 --> 2:12:02.360]  of the new world order it is death
[2:12:02.360 --> 2:12:04.360]  and it seeks to kill David
[2:12:04.360 --> 2:12:06.360]  Ike the elite have stated openly
[2:12:06.360 --> 2:12:08.360]  we have this in my film in game
[2:12:08.360 --> 2:12:10.360]  that they will destroy the planet before
[2:12:10.360 --> 2:12:12.360]  they let true humanity bloom
[2:12:12.360 --> 2:12:14.360]  how do where do you see that going
[2:12:14.360 --> 2:12:16.360]  wishful thinking that's that there's a lot
[2:12:16.360 --> 2:12:18.360]  of wishful thinking going on on
[2:12:18.360 --> 2:12:20.360]  it within their cabal
[2:12:20.360 --> 2:12:22.360]  because you know
[2:12:22.360 --> 2:12:24.360]  compared with
[2:12:24.360 --> 2:12:26.360]  consciousness in its true
[2:12:26.360 --> 2:12:28.360]  state compared with the
[2:12:28.360 --> 2:12:30.360]  infinite consciousness that is
[2:12:30.360 --> 2:12:32.360]  all that is and
[2:12:32.360 --> 2:12:34.360]  we are part of and we are
[2:12:34.360 --> 2:12:36.360]  they are a fly
[2:12:36.360 --> 2:12:38.360]  on an elephant's back
[2:12:38.360 --> 2:12:40.360]  they have
[2:12:40.360 --> 2:12:42.360]  a massively inflated
[2:12:42.360 --> 2:12:44.360]  opinion of their
[2:12:44.360 --> 2:12:46.360]  own power because they
[2:12:46.360 --> 2:12:48.360]  are completely
[2:12:48.360 --> 2:12:50.360]  exactly as you've just described
[2:12:50.360 --> 2:12:52.360]  for the reasons you just described
[2:12:52.360 --> 2:12:54.360]  they are absolutely
[2:12:54.360 --> 2:12:56.360]  disconnected
[2:12:56.360 --> 2:12:58.360]  from higher levels of awareness
[2:12:58.360 --> 2:13:00.360]  and consciousness they are
[2:13:00.360 --> 2:13:02.360]  in a tiny box themselves
[2:13:02.360 --> 2:13:04.360]  they've only been able to control
[2:13:04.360 --> 2:13:06.360]  us because they've manipulated
[2:13:06.360 --> 2:13:08.360]  us into a smaller box of awareness
[2:13:08.360 --> 2:13:10.360]  than they're in and when we
[2:13:10.360 --> 2:13:12.360]  awaken this is why they're terrified of it
[2:13:12.360 --> 2:13:14.360]  we
[2:13:14.360 --> 2:13:16.360]  we just blow the fly
[2:13:16.360 --> 2:13:18.360]  off the elephant's back when we're in
[2:13:18.360 --> 2:13:20.360]  our true power and this vibrational
[2:13:20.360 --> 2:13:22.360]  change this consciousness shift
[2:13:22.360 --> 2:13:24.360]  this consciousness awakening is coming
[2:13:24.360 --> 2:13:26.360]  they're going to get
[2:13:26.360 --> 2:13:28.360]  blown away by it
[2:13:28.360 --> 2:13:30.360]  eventually in a few years from now
[2:13:30.360 --> 2:13:32.360]  because they don't have the power
[2:13:32.360 --> 2:13:34.360]  they think they have because they're in a bubble
[2:13:34.360 --> 2:13:36.360]  therefore they don't know the picture either
[2:13:36.360 --> 2:13:38.360]  they don't know the big picture
[2:13:38.360 --> 2:13:40.360]  they can't access that level that's got the big picture
[2:13:40.360 --> 2:13:42.360]  and the big picture is what is now
[2:13:42.360 --> 2:13:44.360]  manifesting itself through more and more and more
[2:13:44.360 --> 2:13:46.360]  people and the big picture is going to bring
[2:13:46.360 --> 2:13:48.360]  this down and you know
[2:13:48.360 --> 2:13:50.360]  there's many people I would like to be
[2:13:50.360 --> 2:13:52.360]  for the next
[2:13:52.360 --> 2:13:54.360]  little part of our existence
[2:13:54.360 --> 2:13:56.360]  and every single one in the control
[2:13:56.360 --> 2:13:58.360]  system is top of that list
[2:13:58.360 --> 2:14:00.360]  I really wouldn't like to be
[2:14:00.360 --> 2:14:02.360]  there when they realize the true nature of
[2:14:02.360 --> 2:14:04.360]  what's actually going on that's right they
[2:14:04.360 --> 2:14:06.360]  punish themselves and they realize that
[2:14:06.360 --> 2:14:08.360]  they're damning themselves off
[2:14:08.360 --> 2:14:10.360]  from the universe we don't punish them
[2:14:10.360 --> 2:14:12.360]  the creator doesn't punish them
[2:14:12.360 --> 2:14:14.360]  they punish themselves
[2:14:14.360 --> 2:14:16.360]  what happens to them David Ike
[2:14:16.360 --> 2:14:18.360]  as the shift occurs
[2:14:18.360 --> 2:14:20.360]  well you know I could talk
[2:14:20.360 --> 2:14:22.360]  about this at some some considerable
[2:14:22.360 --> 2:14:24.360]  length but they are connected
[2:14:24.360 --> 2:14:26.360]  vibrationally they're connected
[2:14:26.360 --> 2:14:28.360]  to the control construct
[2:14:28.360 --> 2:14:30.360]  it's a vibrational construct
[2:14:30.360 --> 2:14:32.360]  and they're connected to it they're part of it
[2:14:32.360 --> 2:14:34.360]  and when that comes down
[2:14:34.360 --> 2:14:36.360]  well they're out of here
[2:14:36.360 --> 2:14:38.360]  they're out of here they're not going to be
[2:14:38.360 --> 2:14:40.360]  here anymore
[2:14:40.360 --> 2:14:42.360]  but you say the elites don't know that in all their fairy tales
[2:14:42.360 --> 2:14:44.360]  and all their archetypes
[2:14:44.360 --> 2:14:46.360]  when the evil wizard loses his orb
[2:14:46.360 --> 2:14:48.360]  the whole palace collapses on him
[2:14:48.360 --> 2:14:50.360]  this is it
[2:14:50.360 --> 2:14:52.360]  it's a vibrational construct
[2:14:52.360 --> 2:14:54.360]  you could symbolize it in your mind
[2:14:54.360 --> 2:14:56.360]  it's a vibrational box
[2:14:56.360 --> 2:14:58.360]  and they are attached to it
[2:14:58.360 --> 2:15:00.360]  they're part of it they're an expression
[2:15:00.360 --> 2:15:02.360]  of it so when the box comes down
[2:15:02.360 --> 2:15:04.360]  when that vibrational construct
[2:15:04.360 --> 2:15:06.360]  is unpicked and just
[2:15:06.360 --> 2:15:08.360]  falls they fall
[2:15:08.360 --> 2:15:10.360]  and go with it
[2:15:10.360 --> 2:15:12.360]  at the physical level
[2:15:12.360 --> 2:15:14.360]  these guys are going out of existence
[2:15:14.360 --> 2:15:16.360]  because obviously
[2:15:16.360 --> 2:15:18.360]  as consciousness
[2:15:18.360 --> 2:15:20.360]  higher levels of themselves
[2:15:20.360 --> 2:15:22.360]  that they're completely disconnected from
[2:15:22.360 --> 2:15:24.360]  that continues to exist
[2:15:24.360 --> 2:15:26.360]  because we are all eternal consciousness
[2:15:26.360 --> 2:15:28.360]  but that level of them
[2:15:28.360 --> 2:15:30.360]  that has become isolated
[2:15:30.360 --> 2:15:32.360]  in this reality
[2:15:32.360 --> 2:15:34.360]  to the point where they completely disconnected
[2:15:34.360 --> 2:15:36.360]  from the true level of who they are
[2:15:36.360 --> 2:15:38.360]  that's going, that's going
[2:15:38.360 --> 2:15:40.360]  when this change takes place
[2:15:40.360 --> 2:15:42.360]  I want to throw out a few other points
[2:15:42.360 --> 2:15:44.360]  just getting back
[2:15:44.360 --> 2:15:46.360]  to the lay of the ground the topography
[2:15:46.360 --> 2:15:48.360]  here in the third dimension
[2:15:48.360 --> 2:15:50.360]  David Ike
[2:15:50.360 --> 2:15:52.360]  there's no doubt the awakening is happening
[2:15:52.360 --> 2:15:54.360]  and we're always saying it's happening
[2:15:54.360 --> 2:15:56.360]  it's happening but now it's exponential
[2:15:56.360 --> 2:15:58.360]  in whole magnitudes of level
[2:15:58.360 --> 2:16:00.360]  so is their tyranny
[2:16:00.360 --> 2:16:02.360]  Obama being announced the peace prize
[2:16:02.360 --> 2:16:04.360]  for torture and expanding wars
[2:16:04.360 --> 2:16:06.360]  throwing it in our face saying this is what we honor
[2:16:06.360 --> 2:16:08.360]  a sick joke
[2:16:08.360 --> 2:16:10.360]  handing the internet fully over to ICANN
[2:16:10.360 --> 2:16:12.360]  in the UN two weeks ago
[2:16:12.360 --> 2:16:14.360]  open announcements of the end of the dollar
[2:16:14.360 --> 2:16:16.360]  open announcements of world government
[2:16:16.360 --> 2:16:18.360]  they're moving on every front
[2:16:18.360 --> 2:16:20.360]  there is no doubt
[2:16:20.360 --> 2:16:22.360]  that they are attempting
[2:16:22.360 --> 2:16:24.360]  to make their final move
[2:16:24.360 --> 2:16:26.360]  why are they doing this at this time
[2:16:26.360 --> 2:16:28.360]  well they're doing this as I said earlier
[2:16:28.360 --> 2:16:30.360]  because
[2:16:30.360 --> 2:16:32.360]  they're in a core
[2:16:32.360 --> 2:16:34.360]  no and I've known for a long time
[2:16:34.360 --> 2:16:36.360]  that this period
[2:16:36.360 --> 2:16:38.360]  was coming when this vibrational
[2:16:38.360 --> 2:16:40.360]  energetic cycle it's a natural cycle
[2:16:42.360 --> 2:16:44.360]  it was going to start
[2:16:44.360 --> 2:16:46.360]  to get people to
[2:16:46.360 --> 2:16:48.360]  break out of their
[2:16:48.360 --> 2:16:50.360]  mind prisons and so
[2:16:50.360 --> 2:16:52.360]  they have thrown everything they can
[2:16:52.360 --> 2:16:54.360]  and there's more to come obviously at us
[2:16:54.360 --> 2:16:56.360]  at this period of time because they
[2:16:56.360 --> 2:16:58.360]  know this is happening
[2:16:58.360 --> 2:17:00.360]  and they want to put the lid on it
[2:17:00.360 --> 2:17:02.360]  what do they think about us?
[2:17:02.360 --> 2:17:04.360]  if you look at it from another angle
[2:17:04.360 --> 2:17:06.360]  it seems that they're all powerful
[2:17:06.360 --> 2:17:08.360]  and all this you know what they're throwing
[2:17:08.360 --> 2:17:10.360]  all these things
[2:17:10.360 --> 2:17:12.360]  you could list them forever the things that are coming in
[2:17:12.360 --> 2:17:14.360]  why? it's panic
[2:17:14.360 --> 2:17:16.360]  it's blind panic
[2:17:16.360 --> 2:17:18.360]  they might be arrogant on the outside
[2:17:18.360 --> 2:17:20.360]  but not on the inside it's blind panic
[2:17:20.360 --> 2:17:22.360]  that's what I was going to say
[2:17:22.360 --> 2:17:24.360]  the control system is under more threat
[2:17:24.360 --> 2:17:26.360]  than ever before and I got news for them
[2:17:26.360 --> 2:17:28.360]  chill out guys it's coming down
[2:17:28.360 --> 2:17:30.360]  well I agree with you
[2:17:30.360 --> 2:17:32.360]  but it's going to be one hell of a ride
[2:17:32.360 --> 2:17:34.360]  it is the next few years are going to be
[2:17:34.360 --> 2:17:36.360]  big time challenging
[2:17:36.360 --> 2:17:38.360]  what do they think of us?
[2:17:38.360 --> 2:17:40.360]  I mean I've had five big head pieces
[2:17:40.360 --> 2:17:42.360]  the last couple days against me
[2:17:42.360 --> 2:17:44.360]  and they're almost marveling
[2:17:44.360 --> 2:17:46.360]  he's dangerous, he's hypnotic
[2:17:46.360 --> 2:17:48.360]  he's rising
[2:17:48.360 --> 2:17:50.360]  he's got them
[2:17:50.360 --> 2:17:52.360]  chanting the answer to 1984
[2:17:52.360 --> 2:17:54.360]  1776 he stood
[2:17:54.360 --> 2:17:56.360]  before Bilderberg
[2:17:56.360 --> 2:17:58.360]  and said
[2:17:58.360 --> 2:18:00.360]  your new order will fall, humanity will defeat you
[2:18:00.360 --> 2:18:02.360]  and just little old redneck Alex Jones
[2:18:02.360 --> 2:18:04.360]  has got them literally
[2:18:04.360 --> 2:18:06.360]  even in their own writings
[2:18:06.360 --> 2:18:08.360]  afraid, don't they understand
[2:18:08.360 --> 2:18:10.360]  there's only one little expression
[2:18:10.360 --> 2:18:12.360]  David Ike is only one little expression
[2:18:12.360 --> 2:18:14.360]  well you see, we go back
[2:18:14.360 --> 2:18:16.360]  we talked a little while ago
[2:18:16.360 --> 2:18:18.360]  earlier this year about that
[2:18:18.360 --> 2:18:20.360]  film about life
[2:18:20.360 --> 2:18:22.360]  where the grasshopper said
[2:18:22.360 --> 2:18:24.360]  oh, but one ant
[2:18:24.360 --> 2:18:26.360]  stood up to us
[2:18:26.360 --> 2:18:28.360]  and if they figure out
[2:18:28.360 --> 2:18:30.360]  that they outnumber us a hundred
[2:18:30.360 --> 2:18:32.360]  or one then that goes our way of life
[2:18:32.360 --> 2:18:34.360]  they're terrified of what I call
[2:18:34.360 --> 2:18:36.360]  the first domino
[2:18:36.360 --> 2:18:38.360]  because they know if the first domino goes down
[2:18:38.360 --> 2:18:40.360]  it hits another domino and the whole
[2:18:40.360 --> 2:18:42.360]  but it's already gone down so they target people
[2:18:42.360 --> 2:18:44.360]  who
[2:18:44.360 --> 2:18:46.360]  could push the first domino down
[2:18:46.360 --> 2:18:48.360]  and start this whole thing where a lot of dominoes have already gone down
[2:18:48.360 --> 2:18:50.360]  but you know what I mean
[2:18:50.360 --> 2:18:52.360]  but they know if they kill us
[2:18:52.360 --> 2:18:54.360]  brilliant, brilliant, it means you're doing
[2:18:54.360 --> 2:18:56.360]  something they don't want us to do, great
[2:18:56.360 --> 2:18:58.360]  but if they kill David Ike or Alex Jones
[2:18:58.360 --> 2:19:00.360]  they also know that will definitely
[2:19:00.360 --> 2:19:02.360]  be a domino
[2:19:02.360 --> 2:19:04.360]  so they want to attack us but at the same time
[2:19:04.360 --> 2:19:06.360]  they know it only makes us stronger
[2:19:06.360 --> 2:19:08.360]  and they know we're out of fear, ready for that
[2:19:08.360 --> 2:19:10.360]  if it happens, we don't want it to happen already
[2:19:10.360 --> 2:19:12.360]  David, it's been the most amazing interview ever
[2:19:12.360 --> 2:19:14.360]  promise me you'll come back in a couple months

[2:19:36.360 --> 2:19:38.360]  connecting loads of dots
[2:19:38.360 --> 2:19:40.360]  not just about the conspiracy
[2:19:40.360 --> 2:19:42.360]  but the real deep background
[2:19:42.360 --> 2:19:44.360]  where it's coming

[2:24:18.360 --> 2:24:22.360]  I was mailed
[2:24:22.360 --> 2:24:26.360]  from the defense intelligence agency address
[2:24:26.360 --> 2:24:30.360]  United States of America
[2:24:30.360 --> 2:24:32.360]  unclassified for official use only
[2:24:32.360 --> 2:24:34.360]  Dear Alex, we are not all asleep
[2:24:34.360 --> 2:24:36.360]  long live the republic
[2:24:36.360 --> 2:24:40.360]  death to the new world order
[2:24:40.360 --> 2:24:42.360]  this is the kind of stuff I get in the mail
[2:24:42.360 --> 2:24:44.360]  then one time I interviewed a marine
[2:24:44.360 --> 2:24:46.360]  who had worked at space command
[2:24:46.360 --> 2:24:48.360]  and he showed me the photos
[2:24:48.360 --> 2:24:50.360]  he couldn't show me classified stuff
[2:24:50.360 --> 2:24:52.360]  he couldn't show me their parties
[2:24:52.360 --> 2:24:54.360]  and events they'd had
[2:24:54.360 --> 2:24:56.360]  and he was the guy who
[2:24:56.360 --> 2:24:58.360]  in 2000 was driving up I-35
[2:24:58.360 --> 2:25:01.360]  on Kyle and saw an army checkpoint
[2:25:01.360 --> 2:25:03.360]  searching people
[2:25:03.360 --> 2:25:05.360]  and he'd been listening to me for years
[2:25:05.360 --> 2:25:07.360]  and got upset and called me and spilt the beans
[2:25:07.360 --> 2:25:09.360]  about Marines in
[2:25:09.360 --> 2:25:11.360]  88-89 in Norfolk, Virginia
[2:25:11.360 --> 2:25:13.360]  in police uniforms
[2:25:13.360 --> 2:25:15.360]  raiding gun dealers
[2:25:15.360 --> 2:25:19.360]  there's a huge secret program now it's all public
[2:25:19.360 --> 2:25:22.360]  but this is the type of
[2:25:25.360 --> 2:25:28.360]  I'm not going to even show the envelope
[2:25:28.360 --> 2:25:31.360]  I mean, why am I getting
[2:25:31.360 --> 2:25:36.360]  defense intelligence agency stuff
[2:25:36.360 --> 2:25:42.360]  and they had to, I guess, get permission
[2:25:42.360 --> 2:25:47.360]  to send me this
[2:25:47.360 --> 2:25:52.360]  very, very bizarre
[2:25:52.360 --> 2:25:55.360]  to receive this type of stuff
[2:25:55.360 --> 2:25:57.360]  but the Marine showed me his space command patch
[2:25:57.360 --> 2:25:59.360]  photos of him
[2:25:59.360 --> 2:26:01.360]  he was a Marine Corps captain
[2:26:01.360 --> 2:26:03.360]  he then got out and started a computer company
[2:26:03.360 --> 2:26:05.360]  that's a separate guy but it's just the type of stuff I get
[2:26:05.360 --> 2:26:07.360]  dear Alex, we're not all asleep
[2:26:07.360 --> 2:26:09.360]  long of the republic death to the new world order
[2:26:09.360 --> 2:26:11.360]  I mean, what does this mean
[2:26:11.360 --> 2:26:14.360]  to get this from defense intelligence agency
[2:26:14.360 --> 2:26:19.360]  in Washington DC
[2:26:19.360 --> 2:26:23.360]  I'm living in the twilight zone
[2:26:23.360 --> 2:26:27.360]  I really am
[2:26:27.360 --> 2:26:29.360]  I've decided that I will
[2:26:29.360 --> 2:26:32.360]  take off more time in the future
[2:26:32.360 --> 2:26:35.360]  because every time I take off three, four days
[2:26:35.360 --> 2:26:37.360]  and really unplug from a lot of stuff
[2:26:37.360 --> 2:26:39.360]  I still did a lot of work, a lot of research
[2:26:39.360 --> 2:26:43.360]  but I cut down my workload about 95%
[2:26:43.360 --> 2:26:45.360]  sometimes you got to pull back from things
[2:26:45.360 --> 2:26:47.360]  to really get your bearings and realize
[2:26:47.360 --> 2:26:52.360]  where you're at and what you're doing
[2:26:52.360 --> 2:26:55.360]  I just want to tell the guys running the show
[2:26:55.360 --> 2:26:56.360]  and everybody here at my office
[2:26:56.360 --> 2:26:57.360]  what a great job they do
[2:26:57.360 --> 2:26:59.360]  and how much I appreciate them
[2:26:59.360 --> 2:27:01.360]  you know, I'm not a manager
[2:27:01.360 --> 2:27:05.360]  I didn't go to college to be a business manager
[2:27:05.360 --> 2:27:08.360]  and I've tried to run the best operation I can
[2:27:08.360 --> 2:27:11.360]  and whereas I am in the world
[2:27:11.360 --> 2:27:16.360]  but not of the world, that's what the apostle Paul said we should be
[2:27:16.360 --> 2:27:18.360]  and please don't when I talk about religion
[2:27:18.360 --> 2:27:21.360]  I'm not talking about the Pharisees of mainline religion
[2:27:21.360 --> 2:27:24.360]  I mean the real thing that Christ talked about
[2:27:24.360 --> 2:27:26.360]  it's very frustrating to me
[2:27:26.360 --> 2:27:28.360]  because I want to be all information
[2:27:28.360 --> 2:27:31.360]  I don't want to be up here
[2:27:31.360 --> 2:27:34.360]  having to pitch my sponsors and pitch things
[2:27:34.360 --> 2:27:36.360]  and constantly try to fund my operation
[2:27:36.360 --> 2:27:40.360]  but that's what the real world entails
[2:27:40.360 --> 2:27:43.360]  and I don't like having to spend my time
[2:27:43.360 --> 2:27:45.360]  deciding on what type of light bulbs to buy
[2:27:45.360 --> 2:27:48.360]  and who's not carrying the trash out
[2:27:48.360 --> 2:27:50.360]  and I'm not complaining
[2:27:50.360 --> 2:27:53.360]  it's just that I'm so tied up
[2:27:53.360 --> 2:27:55.360]  like we all are in the everyday grind
[2:27:55.360 --> 2:27:57.360]  that I want to do even more
[2:27:57.360 --> 2:27:59.360]  to fight the new world order
[2:27:59.360 --> 2:28:01.360]  but then when I overwork myself
[2:28:01.360 --> 2:28:02.360]  like a race car engine
[2:28:02.360 --> 2:28:04.360]  I kind of heat up and blow a gasket
[2:28:04.360 --> 2:28:06.360]  and then it's ineffective
[2:28:06.360 --> 2:28:09.360]  but I'm just going to turn it over to God
[2:28:09.360 --> 2:28:11.360]  because last night
[2:28:11.360 --> 2:28:14.360]  I wrote some notes to myself
[2:28:14.360 --> 2:28:16.360]  I have a little blue tablet here
[2:28:16.360 --> 2:28:18.360]  I guess it's out there
[2:28:18.360 --> 2:28:21.360]  but the first thing I wrote that I wanted to talk about today
[2:28:21.360 --> 2:28:23.360]  was the fact that I'm in over my head
[2:28:23.360 --> 2:28:26.360]  I mean I'm in way over my head
[2:28:26.360 --> 2:28:29.360]  and I just want to acknowledge everybody
[2:28:29.360 --> 2:28:31.360]  that I don't claim to have all the answers
[2:28:31.360 --> 2:28:34.360]  and that I'm not perfect and that I make mistakes
[2:28:34.360 --> 2:28:36.360]  but I will tell you this
[2:28:36.360 --> 2:28:40.360]  at least I'm trying my best
[2:28:40.360 --> 2:28:44.360]  and so it's easy for a lot of people
[2:28:44.360 --> 2:28:46.360]  out there to criticize what I do
[2:28:46.360 --> 2:28:47.360]  and when I stumble when I fall
[2:28:47.360 --> 2:28:48.360]  and I appreciate that
[2:28:48.360 --> 2:28:50.360]  because that helps me
[2:28:50.360 --> 2:28:54.360]  and helps me be more of a humble person
[2:28:54.360 --> 2:28:56.360]  but at the same time
[2:28:56.360 --> 2:28:58.360]  if you can do better, please do it
[2:28:58.360 --> 2:29:00.360]  and I know a lot of you can do better
[2:29:00.360 --> 2:29:04.360]  listen, we need strong men and women
[2:29:04.360 --> 2:29:06.360]  to stand up against this tyranny
[2:29:06.360 --> 2:29:08.360]  and speak out against the corruption
[2:29:08.360 --> 2:29:10.360]  that is manifesting and expanding all around us
[2:29:10.360 --> 2:29:13.360]  we need you to be leaders
[2:29:13.360 --> 2:29:15.360]  and we also need you to not get caught up
[2:29:15.360 --> 2:29:17.360]  in all the COINTELPRO infighting
[2:29:17.360 --> 2:29:20.360]  I feel sorry for the operatives
[2:29:20.360 --> 2:29:23.360]  and their minions and their camp followers
[2:29:23.360 --> 2:29:25.360]  who attack me and lie about me constantly
[2:29:25.360 --> 2:29:28.360]  because I know I'm for real
[2:29:28.360 --> 2:29:32.360]  and I know the information we're discussing is important
[2:29:32.360 --> 2:29:34.360]  and I just want to see other people
[2:29:34.360 --> 2:29:40.360]  be good, passionate, strong, loving leaders
[2:29:40.360 --> 2:29:42.360]  I love you
[2:29:42.360 --> 2:29:44.360]  I love all of you
[2:29:44.360 --> 2:30:04.360]  and I love all the magnificent and amazing things you've done
[2:30:14.360 --> 2:30:16.360]  and I hope you enjoyed this video
[2:30:16.360 --> 2:30:44.360]  I hope you enjoyed this video
[2:30:44.360 --> 2:31:02.360]  and I hope you enjoyed this video

[2:31:59.360 --> 2:32:05.360]  For thousands of years, Native American healing has been practiced in North America.
[2:32:05.360 --> 2:32:09.360]  The Native Americans discovered an astonishing healing plant called Siaga.
[2:32:09.360 --> 2:32:20.360]  This pesticide-free, wild-crafted, all-natural wonder is hand-picked by a medicine man and effectively combined with other all-natural and sacred ingredients into a product called defense.

[2:33:27.360 --> 2:33:34.360]  We've got Ted Pike running us for about 10 minutes.
[2:33:34.360 --> 2:33:37.360]  They're really close to passing the hate crimes bill.
[2:33:37.360 --> 2:33:41.360]  They have the cyberbullying bill that says, if you hurt someone's feelings, there's a federal felony.
[2:33:41.360 --> 2:33:50.360]  They're passing bills all over the country that devastate the Second Amendment, California, to make you biometrically scanned by AMO and register you.
[2:33:50.360 --> 2:33:52.360]  Swartz and Eggers signed it.
[2:33:52.360 --> 2:33:56.360]  I haven't even gotten to the five hit pieces against me.
[2:33:56.360 --> 2:34:01.360]  I don't usually cover hit pieces, but these are so desperate by the establishment.
[2:34:01.360 --> 2:34:03.360]  I'll either do it today or tomorrow.
[2:34:03.360 --> 2:34:12.360]  We've got a former Hitler youth coming on to talk about the police state in the next hour.
[2:34:12.360 --> 2:34:14.360]  And then I want to get into Obama and the Peace Prize.
[2:34:14.360 --> 2:34:16.360]  There's just so much.
[2:34:16.360 --> 2:34:27.360]  But I thought of an imperable this morning, a good analogy of the unconscious nature of humanity.
[2:34:27.360 --> 2:34:45.360]  I was in a hurry, shaving, got up, hung out with the kids, did some research, jogged, jumped in the shower, shaved, cut myself really bad for a shaving cut.
[2:34:45.360 --> 2:34:51.360]  And I thought about how every time I get in a hurry and I'm not thinking, hey, this is a dangerous razor is when I cut myself.
[2:34:51.360 --> 2:34:58.360]  And sometimes I'm really bad because I'm like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I mean, you know, really sharp razor getting it done fast.
[2:34:58.360 --> 2:34:59.360]  And it's the same thing.
[2:34:59.360 --> 2:35:01.360]  I was driving back from Port Aransas with my family yesterday.
[2:35:01.360 --> 2:35:04.360]  I took the kids to the beach tail end of summer.
[2:35:04.360 --> 2:35:07.360]  And a person almost came out of their lane and hit us once.
[2:35:07.360 --> 2:35:14.360]  I looked in the fog and rain, didn't see a car that was gray blended in almost hit that car.
[2:35:14.360 --> 2:35:27.360]  And I thought about how it's the things that we do that are dangerous every day that we do every day that we get a blind spot for because we're just immersed in it.
[2:35:27.360 --> 2:35:34.360]  We have to get conscious of the police state and the deadly vaccines and the government corruption and the wars and the lies.
[2:35:34.360 --> 2:35:36.360]  I mean, this is heavy stuff.
[2:35:36.360 --> 2:35:44.360]  Getting on the highway, driving 75 miles an hour with your children down rainy roads is the most dangerous thing statistically you'll ever do with your family.
[2:35:44.360 --> 2:35:47.360]  It's the number one cause of death.
[2:35:47.360 --> 2:35:51.360]  Just like government is the number one cause of unnatural death.
[2:35:51.360 --> 2:35:52.360]  We better be worried about governments.
[2:35:52.360 --> 2:35:55.360]  They killed 200 million people last century.
[2:35:55.360 --> 2:36:01.360]  You know, a shaving cut isn't deadly, but it'll remind you how when you're not thinking doing something fast, you get killed.
[2:36:01.360 --> 2:36:03.360]  So everybody drives safe out there.
[2:36:03.360 --> 2:36:10.360]  Everybody think about what you're doing.
[2:36:10.360 --> 2:36:12.360]  And it's the same thing with the New World Order.
[2:36:12.360 --> 2:36:13.360]  You drive every day.
[2:36:13.360 --> 2:36:20.360]  How do you make yourself realize how dangerous it is with big giant trucks going 70 miles an hour right beside you?
[2:36:20.360 --> 2:36:25.360]  You're driving along with your precious babies that I would give my life up for them in a second to protect them.
[2:36:25.360 --> 2:36:31.360]  But I couldn't stay conscious enough to almost not pull into the wrong lane and smash into somebody.
[2:36:31.360 --> 2:36:35.360]  And I had somebody else almost do it to me.
[2:36:35.360 --> 2:36:39.360]  And every time I'm on the highway on a long trip, I see carnage.
[2:36:39.360 --> 2:36:40.360]  It's the same thing.
[2:36:40.360 --> 2:36:46.360]  We have this evil world government, but because we live here every day, we live with its corruption every day dealing with it.
[2:36:46.360 --> 2:36:49.360]  We don't consciously get how serious it is.
[2:36:49.360 --> 2:36:51.360]  So take your time when you're shaving.
[2:36:51.360 --> 2:36:55.360]  Take your time when you're driving and think about the government and what it's doing.
[2:36:55.360 --> 2:36:58.360]  Do we have Ted Pike?
[2:36:58.360 --> 2:37:01.360]  We're going to go to Pastor Pike here in just a moment.
[2:37:01.360 --> 2:37:03.360]  I wanted to bring Ted up because it's the only time we have to have him on.
[2:37:03.360 --> 2:37:08.360]  And I wanted to get him up today because gold is at $1,055 today.
[2:37:08.360 --> 2:37:11.360]  And I haven't talked to Ted since last Friday.
[2:37:11.360 --> 2:37:15.360]  The owner of this company is a gold broker, one of the most trusted names out there.
[2:37:15.360 --> 2:37:16.360]  It's where I get my precious metals.
[2:37:16.360 --> 2:37:21.360]  I got some last week as backup money for this office and operation.
[2:37:21.360 --> 2:37:23.360]  Better than real estate, better than anything.
[2:37:23.360 --> 2:37:27.360]  And it's more than triple in the last six years, seven years.
[2:37:27.360 --> 2:37:32.360]  I wanted to briefly have Ted come on because he bought gold when it was lower.
[2:37:32.360 --> 2:37:34.360]  He sold out of almost all of it.
[2:37:34.360 --> 2:37:36.360]  It's gone up some, but still lower than what gold's trading at.
[2:37:36.360 --> 2:37:39.360]  He's about to run out of that gold and silver.
[2:37:39.360 --> 2:37:42.360]  So the market just goes up and up and up because they're killing the dollar.
[2:37:42.360 --> 2:37:43.360]  Here's Bloomberg.
[2:37:43.360 --> 2:37:47.360]  Dollar reaches breaking point as banks shift reserves.
[2:37:47.360 --> 2:37:51.360]  Ted Anderson, give us a quick report on what you've got to offer to the listeners today.
[2:37:51.360 --> 2:37:52.360]  Yeah, sure.
[2:37:52.360 --> 2:37:53.360]  I'll make it real brief.
[2:37:53.360 --> 2:37:55.360]  Obviously, yes, the dollar is falling today.
[2:37:55.360 --> 2:37:56.360]  That's why gold has gone up.
[2:37:56.360 --> 2:37:57.360]  Our gold is going up.
[2:37:57.360 --> 2:38:00.360]  We did see a thousand 60, 30 so far today.
[2:38:00.360 --> 2:38:05.360]  What I have right now presently that's at the older prices right now is the 10 dollar
[2:38:05.360 --> 2:38:11.360]  Liberty still at eight 1850 walking Liberty have still at eight 69 British sovereigns
[2:38:11.360 --> 2:38:14.360]  and Franks have just moved up just a little bit.
[2:38:14.360 --> 2:38:19.360]  Currently right now, the British sovereign is at 293, which is $3, $4 more than it was
[2:38:19.360 --> 2:38:21.360]  last time I was on the air with you.
[2:38:21.360 --> 2:38:26.360]  The Frank at 238 again, just a little bit higher than what it was before.
[2:38:26.360 --> 2:38:28.360]  The gold market is very hot.
[2:38:28.360 --> 2:38:30.360]  And it's actually better that the thing is holding like this.
[2:38:30.360 --> 2:38:35.360]  And we were trading in this 1,050 range now for about a week.
[2:38:35.360 --> 2:38:39.360]  And when it breaks through this, it'll hold better because of the fact that it's solid.
[2:38:39.360 --> 2:38:42.360]  It isn't just bouncing like a basketball all over the place.
[2:38:42.360 --> 2:38:46.360]  But yeah, indeed right now, Alex, if you can get into the gold and silver market, I'd get
[2:38:46.360 --> 2:38:50.360]  in the stock market, everything else that's going on out there.
[2:38:50.360 --> 2:38:52.360]  We all know there's trouble.
[2:38:52.360 --> 2:38:57.360]  The oil countries detaching their valuable oil from the dollar.
[2:38:57.360 --> 2:39:02.360]  That means that places like China are going to have to trade to something else in order
[2:39:02.360 --> 2:39:03.360]  to buy their oil.
[2:39:03.360 --> 2:39:05.360]  What do you think they're going to do with their dollars they hold in reserves?
[2:39:05.360 --> 2:39:12.360]  I mean, it's just going to create this tremendous liquidity problem for the United States currency,
[2:39:12.360 --> 2:39:14.360]  which means lower prices on the dollar.
[2:39:14.360 --> 2:39:20.360]  It also means rising prices in commodities like gold and silver oil and everything else.
[2:39:20.360 --> 2:39:24.360]  So if you want to park yourself into something that I consider safe, and I'll give you that,
[2:39:24.360 --> 2:39:29.360]  that's my opinion, many others agree with me, but I consider it much safer to have the
[2:39:29.360 --> 2:39:34.360]  dollar or to have gold than it is to have a fiat paper currency.
[2:39:34.360 --> 2:39:37.360]  So I recommend that you get into gold and you get into gold now.
[2:39:37.360 --> 2:39:39.360]  And I happen to know that's what you hold.
[2:39:39.360 --> 2:39:40.360]  That's what I hold.
[2:39:40.360 --> 2:39:47.360]  Again, what has gone from $280 an ounce the last seven years to $1,055?
[2:39:47.360 --> 2:39:49.360]  They are in the process of killing the dollars.
[2:39:49.360 --> 2:39:50.360]  This year or next year, I don't know.
[2:39:50.360 --> 2:39:52.360]  They are now saying they're going to kill it.
[2:39:52.360 --> 2:39:56.360]  They've gone from should we kill it to how are we going to kill it?
[2:39:56.360 --> 2:40:01.360]  They've gone from should we get rid of it a year ago to how do we gut this Christmas hog?
[2:40:01.360 --> 2:40:06.360]  We're now down to the wire in layman's terms.
[2:40:06.360 --> 2:40:08.360]  What did you buy this gold at in the market?
[2:40:08.360 --> 2:40:12.360]  What level was the market with this group of gold versus 1,055 an ounce?
[2:40:12.360 --> 2:40:17.360]  Well, this is the stuff that I picked up right when gold was breaking from 900 to 1,000.
[2:40:17.360 --> 2:40:20.360]  The Franks and the British sovereigns priced in the marketplace today,
[2:40:20.360 --> 2:40:23.360]  British sovereigns are going to be over 300 now.
[2:40:23.360 --> 2:40:27.360]  Franks are going to be trading in that $240 range.
[2:40:27.360 --> 2:40:28.360]  And you're selling them for what?
[2:40:28.360 --> 2:40:29.360]  Explain this.
[2:40:29.360 --> 2:40:34.360]  Well, right now I'm trading the Franks at 238 and I'm trading the British sovereigns at 393.
[2:40:34.360 --> 2:40:35.360]  But how about this?
[2:40:35.360 --> 2:40:41.360]  What's left over on my walking Liberty halves out of the 50 bags that I picked up at that 869 level?
[2:40:41.360 --> 2:40:45.360]  That stuff is going to go up like crazy because silver is almost, well, what is it?
[2:40:45.360 --> 2:40:50.360]  Silver right now is sitting at, I didn't give that price $17 and 78 cents.
[2:40:50.360 --> 2:40:53.360]  Do you realize that I picked up those walkers when silver was closer?
[2:40:53.360 --> 2:40:56.360]  It was trading between $11 and $12 an ounce.
[2:40:56.360 --> 2:41:03.360]  Yeah, you're paying the $12 an ounce factored into the market price when it said 17 about to go to 18.
[2:41:03.360 --> 2:41:07.360]  Here's the toll free number 800-686-2237.
[2:41:07.360 --> 2:41:12.360]  It's on your screen for prisonplanet.tv viewers 800-686-2237.
[2:41:12.360 --> 2:41:14.360]  Ted, can you hold this till midnight?
[2:41:14.360 --> 2:41:15.360]  I will be, yes.
[2:41:15.360 --> 2:41:19.360]  800-686-2237 or modestresources.com.
[2:41:19.360 --> 2:41:23.360]  Tell them it's the Alex Jones radio special or you will pay more.
[2:41:23.360 --> 2:41:25.360]  800-686-2237.
[2:41:25.360 --> 2:41:27.360]  Thank you so much, Ted.
[2:41:27.360 --> 2:41:28.360]  Yeah, thanks, Alex.
[2:41:28.360 --> 2:41:33.360]  All right, there goes Ted Anderson, one more time, 800-686-2237.
[2:41:33.360 --> 2:41:38.360]  We have a man who was a Hitler youth coming on, wrote the book, Defeating the Talitarian Lie.
[2:41:38.360 --> 2:41:41.360]  A former Hitler youth warns America that's coming up.
[2:41:41.360 --> 2:41:46.360]  I want to go to Reverend Ted Pike and we appreciate him joining us.
[2:41:46.360 --> 2:41:47.360]  He'll give you his website.
[2:41:47.360 --> 2:41:52.360]  No one out there has fought the hate crimes bills, the cyber bullying bills like this man.
[2:41:52.360 --> 2:41:58.360]  They'll use a poor person beaten to death by people to try to pass these laws.
[2:41:58.360 --> 2:42:01.360]  They openly say they want to ban dying climate change.
[2:42:01.360 --> 2:42:03.360]  They want to ban reading from the Bible.
[2:42:03.360 --> 2:42:04.360]  Canada's already started it.
[2:42:04.360 --> 2:42:08.360]  They want to restrict in the cyber bullying act.
[2:42:08.360 --> 2:42:13.360]  It says if you hurt someone's feelings, not even call for violence, you can be federally charged.
[2:42:13.360 --> 2:42:18.360]  This is all happening and this could be on Obama's desk very, very soon.
[2:42:18.360 --> 2:42:20.360]  This is very serious.
[2:42:20.360 --> 2:42:23.360]  Reverend Ted Pike, thank you for joining us.
[2:42:23.360 --> 2:42:25.360]  Well, thanks for having me, Alex.
[2:42:25.360 --> 2:42:27.360]  Tell us the latest, sir.
[2:42:27.360 --> 2:42:29.360]  Well, I'll give you a little background here.
[2:42:29.360 --> 2:42:37.360]  Most of our listeners are probably aware that the federal hate crimes bill passed the House and Senate this spring.
[2:42:37.360 --> 2:42:44.360]  And in the Senate, the hate bill was attached as an amendment to the annual defense authorization bill.
[2:42:44.360 --> 2:42:51.360]  Now, America has a rare opportunity right now, I believe, to actually destroy this federal hate crimes bill.
[2:42:51.360 --> 2:43:01.360]  Because this spring and throughout the spring and summer, Obama has been warning Congress that he will veto any defense spending bill
[2:43:01.360 --> 2:43:08.360]  if it asks $100 billion for extra F-35 warplane engines.
[2:43:08.360 --> 2:43:13.360]  Now, that's exactly what the House and the Senate are asking right now.
[2:43:13.360 --> 2:43:19.360]  They are demanding an extra $100 billion for extra F-35 warplane engines.
[2:43:19.360 --> 2:43:26.360]  They are defying Obama and they are putting him in an excellent position to stand his ground.
[2:43:26.360 --> 2:43:29.360]  You see, this is his first veto threat to Congress.
[2:43:29.360 --> 2:43:33.360]  He has the lot to lose if he loses this veto threat.
[2:43:33.360 --> 2:43:43.360]  And I believe that if Americans avalanche through email the White House website today, we could see the real possibility
[2:43:43.360 --> 2:43:50.360]  that if Obama saw a tsunami of protests coming in against the F-35 engines
[2:43:50.360 --> 2:43:56.360]  and encouraging him not to pass the defense authorization bill,
[2:43:56.360 --> 2:44:07.360]  I think there's a window of opportunity that he could be encouraged to stand true to his promise and actually veto the hate crimes authorization bill package.
[2:44:07.360 --> 2:44:11.360]  And that, of course, would mean the end of the hate bill in this Congress.
[2:44:11.360 --> 2:44:17.360]  And so I'm just encouraging people to send in emails now to the White House website.
[2:44:17.360 --> 2:44:28.360]  And I'll just briefly give that. It's www.whitehouse.gov forward slash contact.
[2:44:28.360 --> 2:44:30.360]  And you can get that on the web.
[2:44:30.360 --> 2:44:34.360]  And here's briefly the two things I suggest you tell the president.
[2:44:34.360 --> 2:44:46.360]  Number one, Mr. President, I will vote out Democrats at midterms if you sign the Freedom Destroying Federal Hate Crimes Bill.
[2:44:46.360 --> 2:44:50.360]  That's number one email. I'd like to send y'all just repeat that a little slower.
[2:44:50.360 --> 2:45:02.360]  Mr. President, I will vote out Democrats at midterms if you sign the Freedom Destroying Federal Hate Crimes Bill.
[2:45:02.360 --> 2:45:12.360]  And then number two, Mr. President, I expect you to keep your promise to veto any military authorization bill
[2:45:12.360 --> 2:45:20.360]  that wastes $100 billion of taxpayers' money on unnecessary F-35 jet engines.
[2:45:20.360 --> 2:45:31.360]  Again, Mr. President, I expect you to keep your promise to veto any military authorization bill
[2:45:31.360 --> 2:45:39.360]  that wastes $100 billion of taxpayers' money on unnecessary F-35 jet engines.
[2:45:39.360 --> 2:45:49.360]  Now, this bill, this authorization bill with this defiant demand for $100 billion of taxpayers' money for unnecessary engines,
[2:45:49.360 --> 2:45:53.360]  that was approved by the House of Representatives last Thursday.
[2:45:53.360 --> 2:45:56.360]  It has not been approved by the Senate.
[2:45:56.360 --> 2:45:59.360]  And today's Memorial Day, obviously, they can't approve it today.
[2:45:59.360 --> 2:46:01.360]  It's not on the Senate calendar for tomorrow.
[2:46:01.360 --> 2:46:03.360]  It could be on for Wednesday.
[2:46:03.360 --> 2:46:11.360]  So we have the better part of a week here to absolutely bombard the White House with these two messages.
[2:46:11.360 --> 2:46:13.360]  Pastor Ted Pike.
[2:46:13.360 --> 2:46:15.360]  People don't have their pen and paper handy.
[2:46:15.360 --> 2:46:18.360]  Just come to truthtellers.org.
[2:46:18.360 --> 2:46:19.360]  We have this article.
[2:46:19.360 --> 2:46:26.360]  We have these instructions and so on right there on the homepage at truthtellers.org.
[2:46:26.360 --> 2:46:30.360]  Reverend, is there any other maneuvers we can do to beat this?
[2:46:30.360 --> 2:46:37.360]  Obviously, they have House rules on no legislating on appropriations, but this is legislation.
[2:46:37.360 --> 2:46:40.360]  Freedom of speech killing.
[2:46:40.360 --> 2:46:42.360]  Is there any other maneuver?
[2:46:42.360 --> 2:46:46.360]  How could Republicans allow this to be on there?
[2:46:46.360 --> 2:46:48.360]  I mean, are they fighting it?
[2:46:48.360 --> 2:46:49.360]  Is there anything else we can do?
[2:46:49.360 --> 2:46:53.360]  Or do we just hope to kill it over these raptor engines?
[2:46:53.360 --> 2:46:56.360]  I mean, is this a done deal if we don't kill it this one way?
[2:46:56.360 --> 2:47:06.360]  Last week, the House Republicans fought very hard to try to strip it off of the defense authorization bill.
[2:47:06.360 --> 2:47:09.360]  They said it was irrelevant and so on.
[2:47:09.360 --> 2:47:10.360]  They failed.
[2:47:10.360 --> 2:47:13.360]  The Democratic majority was simply too strong.
[2:47:13.360 --> 2:47:17.360]  I expect the same thing will probably happen in the Senate.
[2:47:17.360 --> 2:47:22.360]  And as I say, that could happen probably as early as Wednesday.
[2:47:22.360 --> 2:47:29.360]  What I think we have to do here is paradoxically we have to stand behind Obama.
[2:47:29.360 --> 2:47:35.360]  Obama in his DFW speeches late as August, he laid down a lot of the Democrats.
[2:47:35.360 --> 2:47:44.360]  He said, if you add $100 billion of extra pork on this defense authorization bill, I'm going to veto it.
[2:47:44.360 --> 2:47:45.360]  He laid it down.
[2:47:45.360 --> 2:47:46.360]  He says, I'm not backing down.
[2:47:46.360 --> 2:47:49.360]  And that's exactly what they did last week.
[2:47:49.360 --> 2:47:54.360]  Reverend Pike, briefly, people can go to trutelers.org to find out more.
[2:47:54.360 --> 2:47:55.360]  And this is serious.
[2:47:55.360 --> 2:47:56.360]  We've got to fight this.
[2:47:56.360 --> 2:47:57.360]  Consequences ours.
[2:47:57.360 --> 2:47:59.360]  Well, duty is ours.
[2:47:59.360 --> 2:48:01.360]  Consequence belongs to God.
[2:48:01.360 --> 2:48:03.360]  We've got to do the right thing here regardless.
[2:48:03.360 --> 2:48:07.360]  But for those that don't know, briefly explain to them what this hate bill does.
[2:48:07.360 --> 2:48:12.360]  It expands a federal thought crimes division, a commissariat.
[2:48:12.360 --> 2:48:13.360]  Absolutely.
[2:48:13.360 --> 2:48:19.360]  Just look up to Canada where they've lost free speech as a result of this kind of legislation,
[2:48:19.360 --> 2:48:24.360]  which was introduced by the ADL, Anti-Defamation League, back in 1970.
[2:48:24.360 --> 2:48:26.360]  That's what's coming for America.
[2:48:26.360 --> 2:48:30.360]  I'll just give you a brief resume of the amendments to the Constitution it destroys.
[2:48:30.360 --> 2:48:37.360]  It destroys the 14th Amendment of the Constitution, which says the government can't give special protections,
[2:48:37.360 --> 2:48:41.360]  rights and services to special groups above others.
[2:48:41.360 --> 2:48:50.360]  This bill elevates homosexuals, Jews, Latinos, Muslims three times higher than the rest of the population,
[2:48:50.360 --> 2:48:54.360]  tripling penalties for anybody who commits a hate crime against them.
[2:48:54.360 --> 2:49:02.360]  It also destroys the 10th Amendment of the Constitution by unifying federal law enforcement with local law enforcement.
[2:49:02.360 --> 2:49:06.360]  It's called the Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act.
[2:49:06.360 --> 2:49:18.360]  That means it's an attempt to unify in a seamless chain of command federal policing powers with local policing powers against violent hate crimes.
[2:49:18.360 --> 2:49:25.360]  That's the very definition of a police state when you have no checks and balances on federal policing powers.
[2:49:25.360 --> 2:49:29.360]  Thirdly, it will destroy the First Amendment of the Constitution.
[2:49:29.360 --> 2:49:40.360]  The 1968 law on which this is based says in Title 18, Section 2A, that if anybody's speech induces or incites somebody else,
[2:49:40.360 --> 2:49:46.360]  even on the airwaves 2,000 miles away, to commit some kind of violent hate crime,
[2:49:46.360 --> 2:49:54.360]  and the perpetrator of the hate crime says he was influenced by Alex Jones or Reverend So-and-So or whatever,
[2:49:54.360 --> 2:50:02.360]  then Alex Jones and that pastor are going to have to stand in federal court as having been guilty of inciting the violent hate crime.
[2:50:02.360 --> 2:50:08.360]  Now, it is true that as a result of a great deal of protests that we brought in back in July,
[2:50:08.360 --> 2:50:17.360]  the Brownback Amendment was reluctantly added by the Democrats saying that a pastor, a talk show host,
[2:50:17.360 --> 2:50:23.360]  a publisher, whatever cannot be directly indicted for the general effect of his speech.
[2:50:23.360 --> 2:50:27.360]  He has to immediately incite some kind of violent act.
[2:50:27.360 --> 2:50:35.360]  On the other hand, the whole momentum of this legislation is to create a bias-oriented justice system in America,
[2:50:35.360 --> 2:50:41.360]  which will lay down indictments, and then these cases will go to...
[2:50:41.360 --> 2:50:46.360]  Stay there. Stay there. Do a final segment, Reverend Pike. We've got a break.
[2:50:46.360 --> 2:50:51.360]  It sets up the federalization of police and builds the grid and sets up the political police.
[2:50:51.360 --> 2:50:56.360]  Now they've openly announced World Government Police run by the Justice Department,
[2:50:56.360 --> 2:51:22.360]  and they're going to track you down for your speech. That's in the New York Times.
[2:51:22.360 --> 2:51:37.360]  That's right.
[2:51:37.360 --> 2:52:02.360]  That's right.
[2:52:02.360 --> 2:52:28.360]  That's right.
[2:52:28.360 --> 2:52:54.360]  That's right.

[2:54:21.360 --> 2:54:32.360]  We've got a few minutes left with Reverend Ted Pine, TrueTellers.org. I'm Alex Jones with infowarx.com and prismplanet.com.
[2:54:32.360 --> 2:54:39.360]  Reverend, you were going over some of the things that it does, and we've got the cyberbullying on top of it.
[2:54:39.360 --> 2:54:42.360]  I mean, this really is the fall of the Republic.
[2:54:42.360 --> 2:54:48.360]  Alex, in the last several weeks, we've pretty much knocked the cyberbullying bill in the head.
[2:54:48.360 --> 2:54:52.360]  A lot of people called in and we got the Republicans active.
[2:54:52.360 --> 2:55:01.360]  They brought in excellent constitutional witnesses in that judiciary crime subcommittee hearing, and we routed them.
[2:55:01.360 --> 2:55:07.360]  In fact, the big media in the United States, including the New York Times, the popular science online and so on,
[2:55:07.360 --> 2:55:09.360]  was ridiculing the cyberbullying bill.
[2:55:09.360 --> 2:55:16.360]  I tell you that to encourage people that when we take action and really scream bloody murder about these bills,
[2:55:16.360 --> 2:55:22.360]  we can hold the Liberals ADL and so on homosexual lobby back in Congress.
[2:55:22.360 --> 2:55:25.360]  That's exactly what we've got to do right now.
[2:55:25.360 --> 2:55:27.360]  We literally have hours before that.
[2:55:27.360 --> 2:55:31.360]  This awful federal hate crimes bill could be brought before the president.
[2:55:31.360 --> 2:55:36.360]  We need to send off those emails to whitehouse.gov, come to TrueTellers.
[2:55:36.360 --> 2:55:39.360]  We've got it all laid out there on our action page.
[2:55:39.360 --> 2:55:41.360]  Exactly what you're supposed to say. Get those off.
[2:55:41.360 --> 2:55:47.360]  It only takes you 10 minutes, 5 minutes, in fact, to do more than you could possibly imagine right now,
[2:55:47.360 --> 2:55:54.360]  I believe, to encourage the president to stand by his harsh promise he made to Democrats.
[2:55:54.360 --> 2:55:59.360]  But if they're going to add $100 billion more pork on that arms bill, he's going to veto it.
[2:55:59.360 --> 2:56:01.360]  Let's stand behind him.
[2:56:01.360 --> 2:56:07.360]  Let's stand behind Obama and let him know that the American people are number one.
[2:56:07.360 --> 2:56:10.360]  They're not going to stand for him to sign this bill in the law.
[2:56:10.360 --> 2:56:14.360]  We're going to take revenge next year with midterms if he does sign it in.
[2:56:14.360 --> 2:56:22.360]  Number two, he has to stand up behind his promise repeatedly made this spring
[2:56:22.360 --> 2:56:29.360]  that he will not load down the American people with another $100 billion
[2:56:29.360 --> 2:56:33.360]  for unnecessary wasteful F-35 action.
[2:56:33.360 --> 2:56:38.360]  Well, Ted Pike, the problem is he always does the opposite of what he says he'll do.
[2:56:38.360 --> 2:56:43.360]  But, well, let's pray we put pressure on him this time because this is a First Amendment killer.
[2:56:43.360 --> 2:56:45.360]  Ted Pike, thank you for joining us.
[2:56:45.360 --> 2:56:47.360]  Thank you, Alex.
[2:56:47.360 --> 2:56:49.360]  There he goes, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:56:49.360 --> 2:56:52.360]  Now, we're going to start the next hour.
[2:56:52.360 --> 2:57:00.360]  And at the second break, we're going to get our guest on, the five after, who was in the Hitler Youth
[2:57:00.360 --> 2:57:05.360]  and he'll tell you about the police status book as defeating the egalitarian line.
[2:57:05.360 --> 2:57:09.360]  I also want to thank some of the sponsors that have made today's radio show possible.
[2:57:09.360 --> 2:57:12.360]  One of them is AkolaBlue.com.

[2:58:39.360 --> 2:58:58.360]  Stay with us.
[2:59:09.360 --> 2:59:16.360]  E-C-U-A-D-O-R, Central.com, Ecuador.
[2:59:39.360 --> 2:59:49.360]  E-C-U-A-D-O-R, Central.com, Ecuador.
[2:59:49.360 --> 2:59:59.360]  E-C-U-A-D-O-R, Central.com, Ecuador.
[2:59:59.360 --> 3:00:15.360]  Monday through Friday, from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., Central Standard Time, that's high noon to 4 p.m.
[3:00:15.360 --> 3:00:17.360]  Eastern, we are here live.
[3:00:17.360 --> 3:00:19.360]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[3:00:19.360 --> 3:00:25.360]  We're making leaps and bounds every day exponentially in the amount of people that we're reaching.
[3:00:25.360 --> 3:00:32.360]  And most of that credit goes to you, the core audience of this show, for now 14 years,
[3:00:32.360 --> 3:00:35.360]  or to believe it's been 14 years.
[3:00:35.360 --> 3:00:38.360]  Together, we're making a difference with God's help.
[3:00:38.360 --> 3:00:43.360]  So I commend you, and the edifying work you're doing continue.
[3:00:43.360 --> 3:00:49.360]  And remember that any persecution, all the pain we go through is a blessing,
[3:00:49.360 --> 3:00:54.360]  and then we suffered it together against the globalist.
[3:00:54.360 --> 3:00:59.360]  And if you ever look into their mind and look into their works and find out who they really are,
[3:00:59.360 --> 3:01:03.360]  so many people that never fought the globalist, once they research it and find out who they are,
[3:01:03.360 --> 3:01:06.360]  they're like, how did I not know about this before?
[3:01:06.360 --> 3:01:08.360]  How did I not fight these people?
[3:01:08.360 --> 3:01:14.360]  Later in the show, but probably more tomorrow, I probably never even getting to it.
[3:01:14.360 --> 3:01:16.360]  I never seem to, really.
[3:01:16.360 --> 3:01:21.360]  I wanted to read the piece out of the, or parts of it out of the New Republic,
[3:01:21.360 --> 3:01:26.360]  big in Europe, the U.S. and Canada, top Bilderberg group, family publishes it,
[3:01:26.360 --> 3:01:33.360]  really savaging me and saying that, you know, I'm hypnotizing the population,
[3:01:33.360 --> 3:01:41.360]  that I am, you know, dangerous, that I'm making up that there's a call for a new world currency,
[3:01:41.360 --> 3:01:47.360]  that I'm making up, that there's eugenics, that I'm making it up,
[3:01:47.360 --> 3:01:53.360]  that the White House Science Zarb said that they wanted to put sterilants in the water to sterilize this.
[3:01:53.360 --> 3:02:05.360]  It doesn't matter that I own at least 10 textbooks he wrote or co-authored calling for it.
[3:02:05.360 --> 3:02:15.360]  And they say I'm anti-Semitic and they're, well, they say my work is like the protocols of the earned
[3:02:15.360 --> 3:02:20.360]  elders of Zion without the Jew references.
[3:02:20.360 --> 3:02:25.360]  No, it's you pimping Jews, just like black Chicago leaders,
[3:02:25.360 --> 3:02:31.360]  pimp black people and use them to sell their agenda and call anybody a racist who doesn't want to go along with them.
[3:02:31.360 --> 3:02:41.360]  You are the people most responsible for putting the word Jews into debates about the private Federal Reserve and the New World Order.
[3:02:41.360 --> 3:02:45.360]  And they know that they want to divide and conquer.
[3:02:45.360 --> 3:02:53.360]  They want to divide us along race, religion, ethnicity, and I'm just sick of it.
[3:02:53.360 --> 3:02:56.360]  We're here calling for humanity to stand against evil.
[3:02:56.360 --> 3:02:58.360]  We know there are evil people in every group.
[3:02:58.360 --> 3:03:00.360]  There are good people in every group.
[3:03:00.360 --> 3:03:08.360]  We are about ideas here and the salon article just says I'm completely insane and dangerous in this big threat.
[3:03:08.360 --> 3:03:12.360]  Media Matter says I'm the big rising threat.
[3:03:12.360 --> 3:03:14.360]  A bunch of other publications.
[3:03:14.360 --> 3:03:17.360]  George Soros run or attacking me.
[3:03:17.360 --> 3:03:27.360]  So keep us in your prayers as we face these folks down in the totalitarianism that they're trying to bring into this nation.
[3:03:27.360 --> 3:03:29.360]  Because it's very serious.
[3:03:29.360 --> 3:03:34.360]  You know, I remember reading State Department document 7277.
[3:03:34.360 --> 3:03:53.360]  I had a copy of it from the State Department little blue 40 something page booklet and it announced in the 60s how they would disarm the American people, how they would bring in foreign troops, how they would federalize police, how they would then bring in foreign troops and foreign police to arrest Americans under international law where you have no
[3:03:53.360 --> 3:04:11.360]  civil rights or constitution and then I'd see news eight pieces in Austin and around the country see other ones where they'd say oh 24 police from Tokyo, Japan are coming for six months to live in Austin and work with Austin police and 24 Austin police.
[3:04:11.360 --> 3:04:23.360]  I saw this a few years ago are going to Tokyo and when they're done with the exchange program they'll be able to come and arrest people in the US will be able to go arrest people under our laws in Japan.
[3:04:23.360 --> 3:04:31.360]  See this global corporate government that's rewriting all the rules getting rid of the checks and balances getting rid of due process and liberties and freedom.
[3:04:31.360 --> 3:04:42.360]  That's all that's happening and now the New York Times and others have announced with great fervor and said how great it is that they are announced a new world police force for taxes for speech for everything.
[3:04:42.360 --> 3:04:48.360]  We've got an article about it Waco siege and force her to rule over global police force.
[3:04:48.360 --> 3:05:00.360]  Man who both approved of and covered up government slaughter of 76 people including 20 children will lead move to establish international model of law enforcement.
[3:05:00.360 --> 3:05:04.360]  Hello this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[3:05:04.360 --> 3:05:09.360]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[3:05:09.360 --> 3:05:15.360]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[3:05:15.360 --> 3:05:19.360]  Food is your only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it?
[3:05:19.360 --> 3:05:27.360]  Now or after the battle starts. When will you need it? Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick?
[3:05:27.360 --> 3:05:32.360]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[3:05:32.360 --> 3:05:36.360]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[3:05:36.360 --> 3:05:42.360]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't know.
[3:05:42.360 --> 3:05:45.360]  How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones.
[3:05:45.360 --> 3:06:00.360]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com. Again that number 1-800-409-5633.

[3:07:01.360 --> 3:07:09.360]  Remain in your houses. The President of the United States has declared martial law under Executive Order 11,004.
[3:07:09.360 --> 3:07:20.360]  Will they do it? Will they pull the trigger this time? We all pray they stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day.
[3:07:20.360 --> 3:07:31.360]  Think it can't happen here? Executive Order 10,990 locks down all highways. Executive Order 10,995 seizes control of all media outlets.
[3:07:31.360 --> 3:07:42.360]  Executive Order 10,998 controls all farms and food supplies. All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded and waiting for the right crisis.
[3:07:42.360 --> 3:07:51.360]  So if you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America, or have questions about how to survive it, go to martiallawsurvival.com.
[3:07:51.360 --> 3:07:56.360]  That's martiallawsurvival.com. Go to martiallawsurvival.com right now.
[3:07:56.360 --> 3:08:13.360]  You must remain in your houses until your bracelets are scanned.
[3:08:27.360 --> 3:08:41.360]  We've had victims of the communist oppressors on from China, the Maoist, we've had victims of the Vietnamese oppressors on, and I've also interviewed survivors of Hitler's Germany as well.
[3:08:41.360 --> 3:08:56.360]  But there is an author, Hilmer von Kompi, and he's written Defeating the Totalitarian Lie, a former Hitler Youth Warns America, and I've scanned over the book. It's excellent. I just got it last week before I went out of town.
[3:08:56.360 --> 3:09:07.360]  But I do recommend it to everyone from his perspective. So for the balance of the hour, the next 51 minutes, we're going to be spending some time with Hilmer von Kompi.
[3:09:07.360 --> 3:09:18.360]  He moved out of Germany after World War II and lived in Central South America and then Mexico and now the United States for the last 20 years. His website is vonkompi.com.
[3:09:18.360 --> 3:09:24.360]  We have that up on screen. Also, Sommel Casting on the Radio at PrismPlanet.tv for PrismPlanet.tv members.
[3:09:24.360 --> 3:09:29.360]  And they'll also be archived up there for everybody who wants people to see the show, not just hear it.
[3:09:29.360 --> 3:09:32.360]  I want to thank all the great radio listeners as well.
[3:09:32.360 --> 3:09:41.360]  But they have openly announced 3.4 million Girl Scouts are being trained by Homeland Security to quote, fight terror and be a PR spokesman for the government.
[3:09:41.360 --> 3:09:48.360]  They always claim it's for Al Qaeda. Then they flip it and say it's for Homeland Security, for gun owners, conservatives, libertarians.
[3:09:48.360 --> 3:09:55.360]  We broke the MIAC report and the DHS report eight months ago on that subject here.
[3:09:55.360 --> 3:10:02.360]  When I was in Hardin, Montana, the last night I went up to Billings to catch my plane the next day.
[3:10:02.360 --> 3:10:07.360]  In the hotel was a Girl Scouts convention with police and Homeland Security.
[3:10:07.360 --> 3:10:12.360]  So I'm not just reading this in the Associated Press. I am seeing it.
[3:10:12.360 --> 3:10:17.360]  The Boy Scouts, New York Times reports are training for gun confiscation to quote, take on disgruntled vets.
[3:10:17.360 --> 3:10:23.360]  The New York Times says it's a good thing. We cover that in my new film, Coming Out Fall, The Republic.
[3:10:23.360 --> 3:10:29.360]  They've got citizen spies everywhere. They're training everyone to spy. They're training us to submit to tyranny.
[3:10:29.360 --> 3:10:32.360]  It's happening all over the planet. The hate speech laws.
[3:10:32.360 --> 3:10:38.360]  And the name of fighting Hitlerian type things are actually being used to bring in Hitler-like systems of control.
[3:10:38.360 --> 3:10:45.360]  So joining us is Hilmer Von Campy, author of Defeating with the Talitarian Lie, a former Hitler Youth, Warns American.
[3:10:45.360 --> 3:10:49.360]  And we're going to get into his warning to America and the parallels today.
[3:10:49.360 --> 3:10:56.360]  But I first want him to describe the citizen spies, the Hitler Youth, the process, how they turned them against their families,
[3:10:56.360 --> 3:11:02.360]  how this culture took over because the Germans were very moral people.
[3:11:02.360 --> 3:11:06.360]  Just like Americans in the 30s and 40s were more moral than we are now.
[3:11:06.360 --> 3:11:14.360]  Germans were very moral then, probably even more moral because I've studied it on average, crime rates, not stealing, not lying than Americans.
[3:11:14.360 --> 3:11:20.360]  A very moral first world Christian nation taken over by Hitler very quickly.
[3:11:20.360 --> 3:11:25.360]  Now, that can happen here. And they are training the police and military to engage us now.
[3:11:25.360 --> 3:11:28.360]  So we're going to talk about all of this and how we stop it.
[3:11:28.360 --> 3:11:31.360]  Mr. Von Campy, thank you for joining us.
[3:11:31.360 --> 3:11:33.360]  But I'm glad to be here. I know you're sure.
[3:11:33.360 --> 3:11:41.360]  It's good to have you here with us today. You've got the floor. Tell us about your youth, being in the Hitler Youth, what you witnessed.
[3:11:41.360 --> 3:11:46.360]  Well, I was seven years old when the Nazis took over.
[3:11:46.360 --> 3:11:52.360]  So with other words, I didn't have no concept. That was something which was there.
[3:11:52.360 --> 3:12:02.360]  My father, however, he was a civil servant. He was a county commissioner.
[3:12:02.360 --> 3:12:08.360]  He was responsible for a certain area in Germany.
[3:12:08.360 --> 3:12:14.360]  But here in America, you are being elected in Germany. You are being appointed by the government.
[3:12:14.360 --> 3:12:26.360]  So the first day after the Nazis had taken over, they immediately started their own, on the side, organization, I might say.
[3:12:26.360 --> 3:12:45.360]  In the whole country, in Germany, between my father and between his superior area and the provinces, they all had an organization of the Nazis at their side which controlled what was being done and what was not being done.
[3:12:45.360 --> 3:12:49.360]  Were those called the local Gauleiters or what were they called?
[3:12:49.360 --> 3:12:58.360]  Yeah, the Gauleiter was, he was the party person for the province.
[3:12:58.360 --> 3:13:23.360]  My father's side Nazi was a Christ area, a Christ person. They were the real Nazis as they came to my father and asked him to join the party.
[3:13:23.360 --> 3:13:37.360]  And my father refused. So he couldn't dismiss him entirely, but they threw him out of his job and put him in the corner of the country with a much lower income.
[3:13:37.360 --> 3:13:41.360]  But he wasn't very angry because there were others who were like him.
[3:13:41.360 --> 3:13:53.360]  So your father was demoted because he wouldn't fervently serve Hitler as a sub-Gauleiter, as a county commissioner, like Arnold's father. He loved it and served with pleasure.
[3:13:53.360 --> 3:14:15.360]  And they continued expanding from there.
[3:14:15.360 --> 3:14:24.360]  And it was forbidden by a penalty of death to listen to foreign information.
[3:14:24.360 --> 3:14:46.360]  And my father, when there were two broadcasters at that time, one was BBC and another one was Biro Münster in Switzerland who broadcasted German language information into the air.
[3:14:46.360 --> 3:14:58.360]  And my father, at 10 o'clock at night, sat in front of the radio and listened to what they had to say. So he was informed about what other people thought about.
[3:14:58.360 --> 3:15:03.360]  So even though your father didn't like Hitler, his son ended up being a Hitler-Yugin. Explain how that happened.
[3:15:03.360 --> 3:15:19.360]  Well, he just didn't. I think he was aware of the character of the Nazis. And in our family, there were two groups. One were the Nazis and the other one were the non-Nazis.
[3:15:19.360 --> 3:15:30.360]  And my father was heading up the non-Nazis. It was family. And at the end, we didn't talk to each other anymore.
[3:15:30.360 --> 3:15:40.360]  Now, that's a key point, because this happens under these states. The state knows the sons or the daughters are young. They want to show off to their parents.
[3:15:40.360 --> 3:15:45.360]  And a lot of times, they get the kids to even end up turning in their parents.
[3:15:45.360 --> 3:15:50.360]  Or, you know, the kid comes home in the uniform and mom and dad have got to kiss their butt.
[3:15:50.360 --> 3:16:01.360]  Basically, and I've read a lot about that happening in the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany and in Fidel's Cuba, where the dad of the mother knows it's bad, but the kids get indoctrinated and you're saying your family was divided.
[3:16:01.360 --> 3:16:05.360]  Were you the leader of the Nazis in your family or was somebody else?
[3:16:05.360 --> 3:16:23.360]  No, I was not. I was a child. This is what I afterwards learned. What you said is absolutely correct. The Nazis tried to get to the children, to the parents and control what they were doing, but they shouldn't do and so forth.
[3:16:23.360 --> 3:16:30.360]  You know, Hitler's favorite saying, did you hear this at the time? First, we get the women, then we've got the children, so follow the men.
[3:16:30.360 --> 3:16:37.360]  Yeah, no, I haven't heard that one, but that was his, he was after the youth. There was no question about it.
[3:16:37.360 --> 3:16:51.360]  And they also had a parallel organization with Kool. That's where the Nazi elite was being trained and they had my elder brother on their list to get them into it.
[3:16:51.360 --> 3:17:06.360]  And for my parents, it was very difficult. Their main concern in all these years was to save the character of our children so that we were not taken over by the Nazi ideology.
[3:17:06.360 --> 3:17:21.360]  And they only got my elder brother out of the system, so to speak, out of the Nazi school with the help of a doctor who certified that he was at some health reasons why he couldn't be in such a school.
[3:17:21.360 --> 3:17:24.360]  So that worked. So we did not.
[3:17:24.360 --> 3:17:33.360]  So total federalization of schools. How was your family later divided? How did you find out they were divided Nazi, pro-Nazi, anti-Nazi?
[3:17:33.360 --> 3:17:47.360]  Well, that was in the family only. If my father would have been named anti-Nazi, he wouldn't have lived any time much longer.
[3:17:47.360 --> 3:17:48.360]  I understand.
[3:17:48.360 --> 3:18:08.360]  So that was plainly inside the family. But for my parents, it was the same. Now, as far as the Hitler youth is concerned, there was a law which said that every child from 10 years onwards has to get into the Hitler youth.
[3:18:08.360 --> 3:18:23.360]  And there were two sections, the youth from 10 to 14 and then from until 18. And my parents had no choice. They had to deliver us to the Hitler youth.
[3:18:23.360 --> 3:18:39.360]  We had that. I had that for 10 years. I didn't know anything about what was happening for us. The Hitler youth was there when you saw them. And it was part of the infrastructure of the nation at that time.
[3:18:39.360 --> 3:18:53.360]  And we had a good time. We lived in a small village. I think the difference between the bigger city and the smaller city is that in the smaller city everybody knew about everyone.
[3:18:53.360 --> 3:19:12.360]  And it was not that way as in the big cities where people were always on the close to the top Nazis and so forth. We are called out for demonstrations and these kinds of things. But that was all not the case for us.
[3:19:12.360 --> 3:19:20.360]  So we had children. We had not beds. We had quite a good family. We were four children. We had a good time.
[3:19:20.360 --> 3:19:30.360]  We're going to go to break and I want to come back and get into how they took over the children, how they tried to turn them against the parents and parallels with what is happening today.
[3:19:30.360 --> 3:19:42.360]  Because I'm sure you've read Obama wants year round school. They say they want to ban homeschooling so kids can be socialized. They want kids to stay longer at school.
[3:19:42.360 --> 3:19:55.360]  He wants to address them and enlist them to aid him. And we now have the different training manuals that they have the kids singing, changing Christian verses of Jesus loves all the little children.
[3:19:55.360 --> 3:20:12.360]  Red, yellow, black and white. To Obama loves all the children, yellow, black and white. Stay with us.

[3:21:16.360 --> 3:21:26.360]  Whitman, EVA director on the 18 made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.

[3:22:01.360 --> 3:22:09.360]  Gold isn't for you. Ted Anderson, president of Midas Resources. One of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms. I get it.
[3:22:09.360 --> 3:22:18.360]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy that social security would be there for you.
[3:22:18.360 --> 3:22:28.360]  That's not what's happening. You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation or that the dollar wouldn't lose value or that your retirement would be secure.
[3:22:28.360 --> 3:22:36.360]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold. For the realist, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[3:22:36.360 --> 3:22:46.360]  Since 2001, the US dollar index has tanked 30% while gold has risen 300%. Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios. You should, too.

[3:24:17.360 --> 3:24:24.360]  I've got the book here in my hands, defeating the totalitarian life. Former Hitler Youth warns America.
[3:24:24.360 --> 3:24:32.360]  Hillmar von Kampi. We're going to show you some photographs in the book for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers. Everybody else listens along on the radio.
[3:24:32.360 --> 3:24:45.360]  Hey, short segment, long segment coming up, sir. You wanted to get into the parallels between what was happening then. Do you as a Hitler Youth, Hitler's takeover through the war with what's starting to happen in the western world today, namely the United States? Go ahead.
[3:24:45.360 --> 3:25:05.360]  Well, there are quite a number. Let me start with two. We had in our schools, that is what I wanted to say already earlier, the communication system was in control of the Nazis.
[3:25:05.360 --> 3:25:25.360]  And what we heard was not the news, but the promotion of the news. In other words, they told us as news, which was where we wanted to know us, to know their, not their view, but that is a brainwashed of what was really happening.
[3:25:25.360 --> 3:25:46.360]  And in the schools, there you had the same Darwinism, which denies God, which you have in your schools here, and taking God out of society, and taking God out of any path in decision making.
[3:25:46.360 --> 3:25:51.360]  And making the state God. And then making the state God, correct?
[3:25:51.360 --> 3:25:58.360]  Well, I didn't get your point. They remove God and the family because they want to make the state God.
[3:25:58.360 --> 3:26:24.360]  Yeah, they had realized the Nazis, like the Soviets, had realized that any authority about their government meets their lives and their power difficult. So we were told, not so much even in the Hitler use, but in school, that the Nazis told us, you can't pray and sing hymns as much as you like in your home and in your churches.
[3:26:24.360 --> 3:26:35.360]  But in society, it is us, the national socialists and not the national fascists, the national socialists controlled everything.
[3:26:35.360 --> 3:26:56.360]  So that was the education is without God. And the society is without God. And that is to my horror, that has developed here. And that is why these guys can do what they are doing. And it is not a battle between communism and capitalism.
[3:26:56.360 --> 3:27:09.360]  It is a battle between God and almighty men. It is about truth and it is about lie. And the question is, who wins this battle? And that is what my book is all about.
[3:27:09.360 --> 3:27:12.360]  So that is part, there are many other parts.
[3:27:12.360 --> 3:27:29.360]  And of course, the point of taking over the youth is to take over the family, but also you ended up becoming a tanker in the war. I mean, you were Hitler youth when he came in in the early 30s, mid 30s, you grew up and then were used in the war. That's why they want the youth is for that indoctrination.
[3:27:29.360 --> 3:27:49.360]  Well, let me answer you. This is a very important point because my book is very much about that to show how in our society, in the totalitarian society, which is what, which I didn't even know the word totalitarian, what it is.
[3:27:49.360 --> 3:28:04.360]  Now, the war began when Hitler told his generals that he would know we needed land in the east and he would now go to war. And then they asked what reason would we have.
[3:28:04.360 --> 3:28:16.360]  He said, I will eventually, don't you worry. What he did was he put some SS people in Polish uniforms, give them Polish arms and send them into Poland.
[3:28:16.360 --> 3:28:28.360]  Then they killed a number of people in the closest concentration camp, put them in the Polish uniform and distributed the dead bodies around a number of buildings.
[3:28:28.360 --> 3:28:49.360]  And then at night, the SS in Polish uniform came to the area, shot in the air, fire in support, pretending a battle, and then they disappeared again. And then came the press and they saw all the dead soldiers lying on the ground.
[3:28:49.360 --> 3:29:04.360]  And Hitler said on the 1st of September, 1939, he said in the speech over radio to the nation that we were attacked by the Polish armed forces and now we are shooting back.
[3:29:04.360 --> 3:29:15.360]  So what I want to stress here is that he lied to us about, we took it for granted that he was speaking the truth, but he lied to us about how it was.
[3:29:15.360 --> 3:29:25.360]  And two days later, the British and the French government declared war on Germany because they had a treaty with the Polish people.
[3:29:25.360 --> 3:29:34.360]  And the British government has rejected to receive the German assistance, wanted to tell them what is going to happen.
[3:29:34.360 --> 3:29:46.360]  Stay there, sir. We've got a break. A false flag terror attack. Hitler, with the Reichstag fire, used that to get total control. Then he launched his war against Poland with Operation Gliwitz.
[3:29:46.360 --> 3:29:51.360]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[3:29:51.360 --> 3:30:01.360]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[3:30:07.360 --> 3:30:15.360]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[3:30:15.360 --> 3:30:21.360]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[3:30:21.360 --> 3:30:23.360]  Now what are you going to do about it?

Shocking, declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[3:31:18.360 --> 3:31:26.360]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[3:31:26.360 --> 3:31:38.360]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spy, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.

[3:35:14.360 --> 3:35:18.360]  Okay, let's continue where you left off. Your story got caught off by the break.
[3:35:18.360 --> 3:35:21.360]  So, Hitler obviously stayed...
[3:35:21.360 --> 3:35:36.360]  On September 1, 1939, the Polish army, which were in reality not the Polish army, but the SS soldiers in Polish uniforms, that they had intruded into Germany
[3:35:36.360 --> 3:35:44.360]  and had shot killed people, and now we should shoot back.
[3:35:44.360 --> 3:35:52.360]  And, well, we took it... I took it... I was then 14 years old, so I took that as a truth.
[3:35:52.360 --> 3:36:06.360]  But then, two days later, the French and British governments declared war on Germany because they had a contract treaty with Poland if they would be attacked by us.
[3:36:06.360 --> 3:36:20.360]  And so, when we heard about this, we said, these are the same enemies as World War I, the British, the main principle enemies, French, the French and British.
[3:36:20.360 --> 3:36:31.360]  This, therefore, is not a Nazi war. This is a German war, and we first have to win the war, and then we have to deal with the Nazis.
[3:36:31.360 --> 3:36:47.360]  So, we went voluntarily. I was drafted, but I would have gone alone also and become a soldier and defend my fatherland.
[3:36:47.360 --> 3:36:59.360]  We had... There were millions of us who did not go for the Nazis into the war, but we wanted to defend our fatherland.
[3:36:59.360 --> 3:37:05.360]  My elder brother fell in Russia, and it was... At that time, it was usual...
[3:37:05.360 --> 3:37:12.360]  We have announcements in the newspapers about people who die and in the war, people who fell.
[3:37:12.360 --> 3:37:27.360]  And if people fell, the family normally said, so and so fell for the Nazi leader, for Hitler, for Germany, and for the people of Germany.
[3:37:27.360 --> 3:37:33.360]  And my brother did not die for the Nazis.
[3:37:33.360 --> 3:37:45.360]  Like us, he thought he would... He's a patriot. He would defend Germany, and so it happened.
[3:37:45.360 --> 3:37:55.360]  And when the war was over, my mother, we were refugees, we were thrown out of Germany, of Eastern Europe, Germany.
[3:37:55.360 --> 3:38:07.360]  And the hatred of the Nazis for her was so terrible that the whole person was full of hate.
[3:38:07.360 --> 3:38:20.360]  Because my father was killed in a Soviet concentration camp, and she made the Nazis responsible for the destruction of our country and for the destruction of our family.
[3:38:20.360 --> 3:38:29.360]  And only when she realized that the Christian hatred was not what Christian teaching was, she realized that she was a fake Christian.
[3:38:29.360 --> 3:38:35.360]  And she went down on her knees, and she couldn't get rid... She could not kill this hatred.
[3:38:35.360 --> 3:38:44.360]  And she went on her knees, and he said to God, if you are there, I know that I shouldn't hate, I cannot help me.
[3:38:44.360 --> 3:38:50.360]  Please help you, me. And I don't get up before I am free of my hatred.
[3:38:50.360 --> 3:38:56.360]  It took her two hours, and then she got up, and she was a free woman.
[3:38:56.360 --> 3:39:07.360]  And I'm telling you this story to tell you the depths of the feeling inside Germany about the Nazi system and the Nazi people and the Nazi ideology.
[3:39:07.360 --> 3:39:17.360]  Of course, one tyranny brought you into World War II, but then your father was killed by the other Soviet tyranny that even killed more people than Hitler.
[3:39:17.360 --> 3:39:26.360]  Let's get into parallels, because you said you really wanted to get into that, and your book covers that, between what's happening in the West and the United States and what you saw in Germany.
[3:39:26.360 --> 3:39:32.360]  The totalitarian mindset, the totalitarian system. More parallels.
[3:39:32.360 --> 3:39:51.360]  Yeah, I think, like everybody else, I look at the radio, I listen to radio broadcasts like this one, I look to the commentaries in the television show,
[3:39:51.360 --> 3:40:03.360]  the national shows where I want to get into, like they're quite a number, the Hediti and then Beckett, and so forth.
[3:40:03.360 --> 3:40:18.360]  But they all deal on territory, which is not the original American territory, it is the consequence of what we have been faced with for quite some time.
[3:40:18.360 --> 3:40:28.360]  I hear people speaking about the battle between capitalism and communism or socialism.
[3:40:28.360 --> 3:40:43.360]  That is not the main issue. The main issue is that God is being taken out of society, out of schools, out of families.
[3:40:43.360 --> 3:41:03.360]  And so I'm saying is that the global ideological war in which we are for decades now, and most Americans don't realize it, which we are in decades, is the role of God in human society.
[3:41:03.360 --> 3:41:16.360]  And Nazi Germany was a part of the interaction against God by Christians and by atheists, people who don't want to accept the commandment of God.
[3:41:16.360 --> 3:41:36.360]  I think the Godlessness in the infrastructure of the United States with 50 million abortions dead, human beings not born being killed, that is much more than the 6 million Jews which the Nazis killed,
[3:41:36.360 --> 3:41:48.360]  and 10 million small like my father, or people like my father who were taken from the Soviets, which have the same similar ideologies.
[3:41:48.360 --> 3:42:12.360]  So there is a connecting part where the so-called Christians who don't stand up and the Nazi ways of defeat the people, their own people, how they went after their own people.
[3:42:12.360 --> 3:42:25.360]  And what you told me, what they're doing now with putting the ideology to bear on our use, that is terrible because it is a road to totalitarian system.
[3:42:25.360 --> 3:42:35.360]  We in America are on the road into a totalitarian system, and we are very close to get in there and have no reply, no return.
[3:42:35.360 --> 3:42:55.360]  I want my book to go to the whole of America to show the difference of what is in common between the Nazi regime, and what we have here, the only difference is that we have also millions of millions of people who do believe in God,
[3:42:55.360 --> 3:43:11.360]  and who want to live a Christian life, and who want a nation which is run not by communists, socialists, but is being run by people who listen to the voice of God and making America a nation under God.
[3:43:11.360 --> 3:43:29.360]  Mr. Von Campy, when you look at Glenn Beck on one side and then Obama on the other, you made a very important point that they're only discussing symptoms, not the disease itself, and the left-right paradigm,
[3:43:29.360 --> 3:43:40.360]  foreign offshore banks that want a centralized government and who want to end the family, and who don't want people to have allegiance to family or God.
[3:43:40.360 --> 3:43:52.360]  I mean, you know, the God could be the Easter Bunny, and I'm a Christian, but I'm saying even if an atheist doesn't believe this, the point is they wouldn't want you worshiping the Easter Bunny, they want you worshiping them.
[3:43:52.360 --> 3:44:03.360]  They want the state to be God, and that's what's being set up here, and classical tyranny is coming in on the left and the right, and you're right, the Nazis called themselves national socialists.
[3:44:03.360 --> 3:44:16.360]  They wanted a centralized system, and any time you get a centralized system, you're going to have the control freaks. You're going to have the people that want to have a centralized system so they can rob and control the population.
[3:44:16.360 --> 3:44:20.360]  You're going to have them come streaming in, and you're right, we're on the road.
[3:44:20.360 --> 3:44:35.360]  In fact, we're already there to totalitarianism. The question is, how much worse will we allow it to get, and so that's why the information you're covering is so important. Tell people the best place to get the book.
[3:44:35.360 --> 3:44:53.360]  Can they get it at Amazon.com? Bookstores, can they get it at VonCampi.com that we'll put up on screen? What's the best way for people to get defeating the totalitarian lie, a former Hitler Youth Warrants America, and then how do we defend the republic?
[3:44:53.360 --> 3:44:57.360]  How do we save, how do we defend against the totalitarian?
[3:44:57.360 --> 3:45:14.360]  The book is via my website, you get my signature with it, but you can get it also at Amazon.com. You can get it also on the WorldNet Daily, it's promoting my books, you can get it there.
[3:45:14.360 --> 3:45:29.360]  Your bookstore may not have them, but unless they're a socialist bookstore, they will get it for you. What was the other question?
[3:45:29.360 --> 3:45:45.360]  Well, no, I just want people to know where they can get the book because I haven't read the whole thing, I got it last week.
[3:45:45.360 --> 3:46:13.360]  It's an enemy, and what have we to do to take them out? First of all, I want to say that the Declaration of Independence says clearly in the second paragraph that the people are entitled to take a government which does not follow the constitution out of their job.
[3:46:13.360 --> 3:46:22.360]  And I'm always asking myself, now who is going to do that? Can we do it and how do we do it?
[3:46:22.360 --> 3:46:49.360]  The other, on the way to that, is the Tea Party movement, I have spoken to these people, they are patriots, they want America as on the basis of the constitution, which this government we have do not want to have this, they promote abortion instead of life, they promote death.
[3:46:49.360 --> 3:46:55.360]  They should not be in our government, they should not tell us what we have to do.
[3:46:55.360 --> 3:47:06.360]  Well, Mr. Von Campy, are you aware of the White House science are not calling for forced abortion, not just abortion, and calling for putting sterilence in the water?
[3:47:06.360 --> 3:47:11.360]  Mr. John P. Holdren, the White House science are, were you aware of that?
[3:47:11.360 --> 3:47:20.360]  I'm aware of that, and that's why I'm saying what most people don't realize, that totalitarianism, that means control of everything.
[3:47:20.360 --> 3:47:22.360]  It means eugenics.
[3:47:22.360 --> 3:47:44.360]  The immorality go hand in hand, it is because people do not have commandments of God, not follow the commandments which God and Jesus have given us, that is because the elect people who have say they are Christian, but have nothing to do with the Christian teachings, and they are enemies of God.
[3:47:44.360 --> 3:47:52.360]  Obama is an enemy of God, and his people develop against the enemies of God and the enemies of America.
[3:47:52.360 --> 3:48:07.360]  But I want to go further though, they are trying to put people in control of the tea parties who are Benedict Arnold's, who are wolves in sheep's clothing to misdirect it and weaken the movement.
[3:48:07.360 --> 3:48:17.360]  Obviously, you know that the establishment isn't going to just let us rise up and take America back, they are going to control the right and the left.
[3:48:17.360 --> 3:48:38.360]  Yeah, but here they have people which may be fiction-like as to the right, but in that sense, the people I have met, they don't really have...
[3:48:38.360 --> 3:48:50.360]  That's the chant of the tea parties, that's my line from in game, we developed that, you know, the answer in 1974, 1976, big hit piece in the New Republic against me points out that I did coin that phrase.
[3:48:50.360 --> 3:48:52.360]  You're absolutely right, sir.
[3:48:52.360 --> 3:49:06.360]  In fact, you mentioned the Declaration of Independence, it says that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it and to institute new government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form
[3:49:06.360 --> 3:49:15.360]  as it shall seem most likely to affect their safety, happiness, prudence, and evil dictate that governments long-established should not be changed for a lot of transient causes.
[3:49:15.360 --> 3:49:28.360]  And accordingly, all experience has shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable than to write themselves by, and it goes on by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed.
[3:49:28.360 --> 3:49:43.360]  But when a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing inevitably the same object invents as a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty to throw off such government and to provide new guards for the future security.
[3:49:43.360 --> 3:49:54.360]  And it goes on to say that, so yes, it is our right and duty to throw off this alien tyranny, this road to perdition, this road to tyranny that we're on.
[3:49:54.360 --> 3:50:03.360]  Looking at America today, being in the Hitler Youth, being a German soldier after that in World War II, is there any doubt in your mind that we're on a very similar path?
[3:50:03.360 --> 3:50:25.360]  Well, I know that we are on a similar path, and the only thing which we did not have is we did not have people. The Germans are not the same as the Americans. The Americans are used that they are, that the government is a servant of the people,
[3:50:25.360 --> 3:50:35.360]  while the Germans are more inclined to accept the government as the ultimate wisdom, and they are likely to obey what...
[3:50:35.360 --> 3:50:45.360]  Yes, very intelligent, very hardworking, very smart, but also because of the Roman control and then the different kingdoms that were there after that.
[3:50:45.360 --> 3:50:53.360]  Germany was only unified in the last 160 years or so, as you know, and so there is that European angle of going along with the king.
[3:50:53.360 --> 3:50:56.360]  We'll be right back with our guests in the final segment.

[3:52:07.360 --> 3:52:15.360]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[3:52:15.360 --> 3:52:22.360]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interests of the American people.
[3:52:22.360 --> 3:52:26.360]  Well, Obama's already fudging. He's fudged since day one in this election.
[3:52:26.360 --> 3:52:38.360]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[3:52:38.360 --> 3:52:48.360]  It's not about left or right. It's about a one-world government. This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[3:55:41.360 --> 3:55:52.360]  fighting against the bank or takeover. That's what we do at infowars.com. And we have people on, like Congressman Ron Paul, the list goes on and on. David Eich coming up in the rebroadcast at infowars.com.
[3:55:52.360 --> 3:55:56.360]  Huge jam-packed show today. Most amazing interview I've ever done with Eich.
[3:55:56.360 --> 3:56:08.360]  VonCampi.com. VonV-O-N-C-A-M-P-E.com is the site to get the book as well. Defeating the utilitarian. Li, a former Hitler Youth, warrants America.
[3:56:08.360 --> 3:56:19.360]  Okay, in closing, we've got about three minutes, sir. When you see the media saying it's anti-government to criticize government, when you hear them say it's anti-American to criticize the private fellow reserve,
[3:56:19.360 --> 3:56:27.360]  when you hear them say that Homeland Security is watching Ron Paul, how did they sell not being able to criticize the government in Germany?
[3:56:27.360 --> 3:56:34.360]  They know it started incrementally. Or were you too little to notice that and just woke up when you were a teenager, you know, a Hitler Youth from age seven,
[3:56:34.360 --> 3:56:39.360]  when you were given the death penalty instantly if you criticize the government? I mean, how did that happen?
[3:56:39.360 --> 3:56:47.360]  Well, we had the Gestapo. The Gestapo is a secret state police. We had them in front of our church in the war.
[3:56:47.360 --> 3:56:53.360]  When they took down, so that everybody who went to church could see it, it took the names down.
[3:56:53.360 --> 3:57:04.360]  And that's the only thing my father, my mother, and we saw four children did not pay any attention to them and they went into the church.
[3:57:04.360 --> 3:57:13.360]  But everybody who saw that knew exactly and everybody know what happens when you express your opposition to what they are doing.
[3:57:13.360 --> 3:57:23.360]  And there was no outcry from the Christian churches against the persecution of the Jews.
[3:57:23.360 --> 3:57:28.360]  But sir, you say by taking their names down, people that had been disappeared?
[3:57:28.360 --> 3:57:33.360]  No, they did not disappear. That was the kind of intimidation which went out.
[3:57:33.360 --> 3:57:45.360]  What names were taken down? What names did not dare to express critics on the government? That was the idea.
[3:57:45.360 --> 3:57:59.360]  And there was this constant propaganda not to become a Nazi, but to be against the Germans having to go to the war.
[3:57:59.360 --> 3:58:05.360]  In fact, the Germans had to go against the warm weather.
[3:58:05.360 --> 3:58:09.360]  You had to be pro-war, or you were an evil person.
[3:58:09.360 --> 3:58:12.360]  No, if I just, we were called.
[3:58:12.360 --> 3:58:24.360]  Any totalitarian system invented a way where it can criminalize the people and take them away.
[3:58:24.360 --> 3:58:29.360]  That's what it does. It makes the general public criminal, like garage sales are illegal and things like that.
[3:58:29.360 --> 3:58:31.360]  Sir, we're out of time.
[3:58:31.360 --> 3:58:38.360]  Obama is also calling the people terrorists who are nothing but patriots.
[3:58:38.360 --> 3:58:43.360]  Sir, we're going to have to talk to you again. Let me say bye to you.
[3:58:43.360 --> 3:58:51.360]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.

[3:59:17.360 --> 3:59:22.360]  Run some pumps, shortwave radios, computers and even keep food from spoiling.
[3:59:22.360 --> 3:59:28.360]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
