[00:00.000 --> 00:08.920]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08.920 --> 00:15.360]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:15.360 --> 00:23.880]  Wow, we've got even more news stacked on the desk here today that needs to be covered
[00:23.880 --> 00:24.880]  than normal.
[00:24.880 --> 00:30.680]  And a normal day is a total information awareness overload.
[00:30.680 --> 00:32.800]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:32.800 --> 00:37.360]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours today as we are every weekday, 11am
[00:37.360 --> 00:40.080]  to 3pm Central Standard Time.
[00:40.080 --> 00:45.160]  We have Wayne Madsen investigative journalist on a whole bunch of huge fronts joining us
[00:45.160 --> 00:46.560]  in the second hour.
[00:46.560 --> 00:49.920]  Richard Reeves pops in also during the second hour.
[00:49.920 --> 00:55.480]  Blue Rockwell on the big theft of the 2016 election, not just from Donald Trump, but from
[00:55.480 --> 00:57.360]  Bernie Sanders as well.
[00:57.360 --> 01:00.840]  And then of course we have Paul Joseph Watson from England who will be hosting the fourth
[01:00.840 --> 01:10.120]  hour of the Nightly News Returns this evening, seven o'clock Central Standard Time.
[01:10.120 --> 01:18.960]  I really need to focus in though, not on manmade things some, but on just the volatile universe,
[01:18.960 --> 01:22.760]  the ever changing universe that we live in.
[01:22.760 --> 01:29.840]  Because tectonic activity right now, depending on which seismologist you read or which publication
[01:29.840 --> 01:35.360]  you look at, but they're pretty much all lining up now, agreeing that this is the most seismic
[01:35.360 --> 01:43.120]  activity ever recorded since they began to record globally about 100 years ago.
[01:43.120 --> 01:53.360]  From Yellowstone in the heart of our nation to the great ring of fire around the Pacific
[01:53.360 --> 01:59.920]  Ocean, things are extremely volatile right now.
[01:59.920 --> 02:03.840]  Huge earthquakes just all over the world yesterday and the day before that and the day before
[02:03.840 --> 02:10.680]  that, there are just giant earthquakes happening all over the planet.
[02:10.680 --> 02:16.960]  And so I almost need to carve out some time away from 2016 and the election and all the
[02:16.960 --> 02:23.920]  war news and the economic news in the next few days to get Stan Dayo and others on.
[02:23.920 --> 02:31.920]  We had Stan Dayo on three years ago and again about six months ago and he predicted that
[02:31.920 --> 02:36.600]  in the next year we would see the most tectonic activity we've ever seen.
[02:36.600 --> 02:37.600]  He's a really smart guy.
[02:37.600 --> 02:39.560]  In fact, they just put on the screen for me.
[02:39.560 --> 02:40.560]  I didn't know.
[02:40.560 --> 02:41.560]  Thanks for telling me.
[02:41.560 --> 02:42.560]  This was just set up this morning.
[02:42.560 --> 02:44.720]  Stan Dayo will be on for over an hour.
[02:44.720 --> 02:51.480]  Always informative on Wednesday and he's a geologist and a lot more, but I should probably
[02:51.480 --> 02:52.480]  get George Norrie on.
[02:52.480 --> 02:56.320]  He's somebody that's really been focused on this and been predicting a lot of this because
[02:56.320 --> 02:58.240]  of all the expert guests he's had on.
[02:58.240 --> 03:03.560]  And you know, George has his fun shows as he calls them, ghost to ghost around Halloween
[03:03.560 --> 03:08.280]  and you know, some of the shows that are more in the fiction realm, but he's the guy that
[03:08.280 --> 03:12.720]  took that broadcast, so I don't want to go off on a jag about this, from 80% Chewbacobras
[03:12.720 --> 03:18.400]  and space aliens to 80% private Federal Reserve, New World Order, World Government.
[03:18.400 --> 03:23.360]  And so we all owe him a continued debt of gratitude that broadcast is there and as ever
[03:23.360 --> 03:28.800]  popular as always, really informing a lot of people.
[03:28.800 --> 03:31.680]  But I digress down a rabbit trail with that.
[03:31.680 --> 03:36.840]  We're going to be getting some more guests on this week also discussing it.
[03:36.840 --> 03:41.000]  Now I'm not a Planet X guy, but there are a lot of big planets out in the Kuiper Belt
[03:41.000 --> 03:46.080]  out past Pluto and there is now a big one coming through the solar system, which a lot
[03:46.080 --> 03:48.960]  of ancient societies predicted would show up about now.
[03:48.960 --> 03:53.360]  What I don't like is ever since I've been on air for 20 years, people are always telling
[03:53.360 --> 03:57.120]  me that Planet X is imminent and it's going to destroy the earth.
[03:57.120 --> 03:58.120]  And then it never happens.
[03:58.120 --> 04:01.960]  It's a way to sell a book perennially every single year.
[04:01.960 --> 04:04.080]  And I just don't go there, but there are big comments.
[04:04.080 --> 04:05.520]  There are big planetoids.
[04:05.520 --> 04:15.080]  There is a big gas giant coming through that is in mainstream media, that is in mainstream
[04:15.080 --> 04:23.120]  media, but not really getting a lot of the attention that it deserves.
[04:23.120 --> 04:26.680]  So that is coming up as well today.
[04:26.680 --> 04:30.280]  I almost have a mustasher.
[04:30.280 --> 04:33.600]  What do they call those little mustaches that are under your lip?
[04:33.600 --> 04:34.600]  Van Dyke.
[04:34.600 --> 04:37.920]  I've got some black ink on my finger.
[04:37.920 --> 04:39.480]  I'm trendy now.
[04:39.480 --> 04:41.280]  I have a Van Dyke.
[04:41.280 --> 04:42.280]  That's really what matters.
[04:42.280 --> 04:47.040]  Let's come back to the next four hours and talk about different type of facial hair.
[04:47.040 --> 04:48.040]  Do you like it?
[04:48.040 --> 04:49.040]  Do you dislike it?
[04:49.040 --> 04:50.040]  What do you think of Van Dyke?
[04:50.040 --> 04:56.320]  What's it mean when a woman has a big handle bear, handle bear, mustach, she's a handle
[04:56.320 --> 04:57.320]  bear.
[04:57.320 --> 04:58.920]  See, I'm inventing new terms here.
[04:58.920 --> 05:07.000]  Nearly 40 volcanoes are currently erupting across the world, and scientists warn that the current conditions could trigger at least four record-breaking earthquakes.
[05:07.000 --> 05:10.880]  The earthquakes that just hit recently have left over 270 dead in Ecuador and over 42 dead
[05:10.880 --> 05:14.560]  in Japan, with massive evacuations continuing out of fear of aftershocks.
[05:14.560 --> 05:18.920]  And scientists say at Tokyo University estimate there's at least a 70% chance that Japan will
[05:18.920 --> 05:23.120]  eventually suffer from another earthquake equivalent to the Great Canto of 1923, which
[05:23.120 --> 05:26.720]  measured 8.9 and killed over 142,000 people.
[05:26.720 --> 05:30.640]  Other scientists also fear a full-blown eruption of the Yellowstone National Park volcano,
[05:30.640 --> 05:35.280]  which could have up to 2,000 times the power of the Mount St. Helens eruption of 1980.
[05:35.280 --> 05:39.000]  Some even speculate that the volcanic winter resulting from a Yellowstone eruption could
[05:39.000 --> 05:42.840]  devastate America's food supply and could even cool the planet 20 degrees.
[05:42.840 --> 05:46.880]  The volcanic ash could even blanket areas 1,000 miles away, and there's already signs
[05:46.880 --> 05:47.880]  an eruption could happen.
[05:47.880 --> 05:51.920]  A few weeks ago, a river near the supervolcano started to boil, and the volcano itself is
[05:51.920 --> 05:53.920]  blasting out even more steam than before.
[05:53.920 --> 05:57.760]  For more news, visit infowars.com and prismplanet.tv.
[05:57.760 --> 05:59.360]  This is Kit Daniels reporting.
[05:59.360 --> 06:03.600]  Please listen carefully, because I'm about to point out three things that will save
[06:03.600 --> 06:09.080]  you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the InfoWars, a 360 win.
[06:09.080 --> 06:14.040]  Number one, when you choose auto ship before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order
[06:14.040 --> 06:15.640]  at infowarsore.com.
[06:15.640 --> 06:19.480]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for
[06:19.480 --> 06:23.560]  auto ship because we hold back a surplus for auto ship customers.
[06:23.560 --> 06:28.840]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[06:28.840 --> 06:32.880]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder
[06:32.880 --> 06:34.680]  the products that you need each month.
[06:34.680 --> 06:39.280]  Just go to infowarsore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on auto ship and
[06:39.280 --> 06:42.400]  choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[06:42.400 --> 06:47.720]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win, and with the new auto ship feature at infowarslife.com,
[06:47.720 --> 06:50.680]  this is a sure win, 10% off on auto ship.
[06:50.680 --> 06:56.040]  Win, win, win at infowarslife.com, free shipping on orders above $50, and all out of stock
[06:56.040 --> 06:59.360]  items are never out of stock when you sign up for auto ship.
[06:59.360 --> 07:03.120]  Anthony Goodsharty here with an InfoWars health news update with Alex Jones.
[07:03.120 --> 07:06.920]  That's right Anthony, one of our top selling products is Brainforge.
[07:06.920 --> 07:11.440]  It is very affordably priced at retail that we normally discount it.
[07:11.440 --> 07:16.120]  We've discounted from the discount 25%, but if you count it from its regular price, that's
[07:16.120 --> 07:21.040]  45% discount for a limited time at infowarslife.com.
[07:21.040 --> 07:24.560]  There are a lot of brain boosters out there, or what's known as new tropics, but here's
[07:24.560 --> 07:27.160]  what separates BrainForce from the rest.
[07:27.160 --> 07:31.720]  Unlike some energy drinks and supplements, BrainForce uses natural brain activation ingredients
[07:31.720 --> 07:38.040]  like Yerba Mante extract, AlphaGPC, L-Theanine, HyperXine A, Phosphatidylserine, B12, and
[07:38.040 --> 07:39.040]  many others.
[07:39.040 --> 07:43.760]  Major nutraceutical review sites rave about this formulation, and they also rave about
[07:43.760 --> 07:44.760]  the price.
[07:44.760 --> 07:51.040]  Ensure your BrainForce today at infowarslife.com and get 45% off retail, 25% off the regular
[07:51.040 --> 07:56.000]  sales price on BrainForce for a limited time at infowarslife.com, or by calling toll-free
[07:56.000 --> 08:02.120]  888-253-3139.
[08:02.120 --> 08:09.400]  I have sworn upon the altar of God, eternal hostility, against every form of tyranny over
[08:09.400 --> 08:11.760]  the mind of man.
[08:11.760 --> 08:28.320]  I'm Thomas Jefferson, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[08:28.320 --> 08:34.000]  It's Monday, the 18th day of April 2016.
[08:34.000 --> 08:38.200]  I'm your host Alex Jones, we're going to be here until 3 o'clock Central Standard
[08:38.200 --> 08:43.400]  Times today, thank you for joining us.
[08:43.400 --> 08:49.200]  All right, obviously there is massive election 2016 news, there is huge military news, there
[08:49.200 --> 08:56.040]  is incredibly important geopolitical military and financial news that ties together.
[08:56.040 --> 09:03.640]  There is unprecedented leftist censorship going on around the world as well, and we're
[09:03.640 --> 09:06.960]  going to be breaking all of that down today.
[09:06.960 --> 09:11.160]  The fate of Obama's immigration plan is in the hands of the Supreme Court, we're going
[09:11.160 --> 09:13.120]  to be looking at that.
[09:13.120 --> 09:17.920]  The State Department wants to speed up the process of bringing Syrian refugees into the
[09:17.920 --> 09:20.200]  United States.
[09:20.200 --> 09:26.360]  A new AOL poll shows nearly half of Sanders supporters might switch to Trump, there's
[09:26.360 --> 09:30.560]  a lot of top Democrats and others coming out saying that he'll already so corrupt that
[09:30.560 --> 09:33.040]  if Sanders loses they're going to go with Trump.
[09:33.040 --> 09:39.600]  So I do bash Sanders supporters, I do dislike socialism and communism, but that said a lot
[09:39.600 --> 09:44.800]  of people are so anti-establishment, they're going for Sanders just as a desperation move,
[09:44.800 --> 09:48.080]  a lot of Ron Paul supporters are supporting him.
[09:48.080 --> 09:54.200]  And so regardless of what you think of Sanders, I think that's a smart move by Sanders supporters
[09:54.200 --> 10:00.680]  watching him be robbed, but he isn't winning by as much or wasn't winning by as much so
[10:00.680 --> 10:06.680]  it's easier to steal from him, it's a smart move to understand that Trump is also anti-establishment
[10:06.680 --> 10:10.720]  and that the power structure is coming after him and so it's very, very important to get
[10:10.720 --> 10:17.040]  behind Donald Trump, even if you have issues with him, the fact that these globalist controllers
[10:17.040 --> 10:22.880]  are so scared illustrates the fact that they've already hijacked the nation and they don't
[10:22.880 --> 10:27.680]  like anybody talking about the fact that they've set up a lot of unfair deals that have put
[10:27.680 --> 10:35.600]  America at disadvantage by design to de-industrialize us and to consolidate control over our lives.
[10:35.600 --> 10:40.000]  And coming up, Donald Trump is said quote, we have the video clip, I'm so happy China
[10:40.000 --> 10:47.160]  is upset, they have waged economic war against us and I'm glad Trump talks like that now
[10:47.160 --> 10:49.400]  because I know he knows what's going on.
[10:49.400 --> 10:52.600]  Previously he would say that they're smarter than us, their leaders are smarter than our
[10:52.600 --> 11:00.080]  leaders and that we've made some really bad deals, no globalist like Henry Kissinger and
[11:00.080 --> 11:04.160]  the Bushes, Bush was the Bush senior, was the first ambassador to China once it opened
[11:04.160 --> 11:13.000]  back up, they made deals, one-sided factory deals to pass regulations in America prohibiting
[11:13.000 --> 11:20.720]  industry here and commerce here and artificially shift it with corporate combines selectively
[11:20.720 --> 11:32.200]  to China as a slave plantation model labeled communism to leverage out all competition
[11:32.200 --> 11:33.440]  globally.
[11:33.440 --> 11:38.840]  This is economic warfare and I've been hammering that for 21 years on air because that's what
[11:38.840 --> 11:40.760]  it is.
[11:40.760 --> 11:48.280]  Globalism is economic warfare, it is a modern form of corporate colonialism.
[11:48.280 --> 11:54.880]  Corporate monopoly colonialism and by the way, I've coined all these terms that are
[11:54.880 --> 11:59.880]  now in use, I'm not bragging, I'm just showing the power of the truth, the power of people
[11:59.880 --> 12:04.800]  finally hearing the truth and then historically looking at definitions and realizing that
[12:04.800 --> 12:12.280]  they are establishing neo feudalistic global fascism labeled as socialism and communism
[12:12.280 --> 12:14.000]  at the grassroots level.
[12:14.000 --> 12:18.560]  The name of the game is domestication of the population, making you dependent, putting
[12:18.560 --> 12:25.480]  you into an artificial system so you can't survive outside of a quote modern smart grid
[12:25.480 --> 12:33.440]  that is really a AI, high tech, artificially intelligent, false creation template that
[12:33.440 --> 12:39.520]  is a proto matrix type human soul destroying machine.
[12:39.520 --> 12:46.760]  We're going to get to all of that today, we're going to get to even foreign newspapers and
[12:46.760 --> 12:52.440]  even major US papers going look, you're supposed to have voters and primaries, you've never
[12:52.440 --> 12:58.400]  done anything like this before, this is unprecedented and the worst part is Ted Cruz keeps talking
[12:58.400 --> 13:04.040]  about the popular vote, landslides and voters and I talked about this two weeks ago.
[13:04.040 --> 13:09.360]  I said he keeps saying I've got grassroots, I've got democracy, I've got the vote and
[13:09.360 --> 13:17.200]  Trump's a sore loser and Fox News and CNN won't ever say what Trump is being a sore
[13:17.200 --> 13:18.200]  loser about.
[13:18.200 --> 13:25.360]  They're now trimming Trump down folks so that people don't know exactly what's happening.
[13:25.360 --> 13:30.040]  But if you actually go look at what's happened in Wyoming this weekend and in Colorado and
[13:30.040 --> 13:37.240]  in Georgia and in Tennessee and in Arizona and Louisiana, they either steal delegates
[13:37.240 --> 13:43.640]  after Trump wins and give them to Ted Cruz or they just cancel it outright and the whole
[13:43.640 --> 13:50.040]  world sees that and goes wait a minute, you're trying to run a Psyop where you look at people
[13:50.040 --> 13:55.640]  with a straight face, a psychological operation and you say listen, there was never a vote,
[13:55.640 --> 14:02.200]  get used to it and Previs and Curly Hewland and all of them keep going on TV smiling with
[14:02.200 --> 14:07.960]  Cheshire Cat, you know what eating grins, laughing at you, trying to act as confident
[14:07.960 --> 14:10.360]  as they can.
[14:10.360 --> 14:16.120]  Like walking in, you get home from work early, your wife is in the bed, there's no sheets,
[14:16.120 --> 14:24.960]  your neighbor is right there, playing his day on top of your wife and he gets up, naked
[14:24.960 --> 14:32.040]  as a J-Burt in front of you, starts putting on his pants and he says Mr. Brown, Mr. Sanchez,
[14:32.040 --> 14:35.440]  Mr. Johnson, whatever your name is.
[14:35.440 --> 14:41.320]  I was just helping your wife put her shoes on and she goes that's right honey, he was
[14:41.320 --> 14:45.840]  just helping with sweat running down her, folks that's how dumb they think we are and
[14:45.840 --> 14:50.160]  I hate to use an allegory or an analogy like that, it's a family show but that's what's
[14:50.160 --> 14:56.840]  going on here except it's not just cheating on you know with your wife in front of you,
[14:56.840 --> 15:03.440]  they're robbing your whole future, this is 21st century fourth fifth generation conquest,
[15:03.440 --> 15:09.320]  this is warfare and Donald Trump saying this is warfare, the Chinese president, the Chinese
[15:09.320 --> 15:15.480]  head of trade, the Chinese censorship board have all come out and called him Hitler.
[15:15.480 --> 15:23.160]  These are people with mobile execution vans that sell peaceful, not even Zen Buddhists,
[15:23.160 --> 15:27.440]  the Falun Gong aren't even religious, you can argue well Buddhism isn't a religion,
[15:27.440 --> 15:33.080]  it's a philosophy, it's a religion okay and it's also a very peaceful religion historically
[15:33.080 --> 15:38.520]  and has a lot of tenets that I find admirable, I'm not a Buddhist but the point is this is
[15:38.520 --> 15:43.040]  one of the most peaceful groups of people there are, they're into not eating unhealthily,
[15:43.040 --> 15:54.200]  not drinking and exercising and so they are perfect for organ harvesting
[15:54.200 --> 15:59.840]  and you have people selling peaceful political dissidents who get caught practicing their
[15:59.840 --> 16:05.520]  religion and I was pointing out that Buddhism is a religion in my view and they say it isn't,
[16:05.520 --> 16:10.680]  when you get down to Falun Gong they've trimmed it back so much that it's not even a religion,
[16:10.680 --> 16:23.840]  it's like an exercise, relaxation, health practice and they are killing them on record
[16:23.840 --> 16:27.520]  and advertising that they quote have fresh organs, that's how they translate it in the
[16:27.520 --> 16:32.680]  Chinese communist publications and then again they take your organs on the way to the airport
[16:32.680 --> 16:37.320]  so they're totally fresh, put them on ice, fly the hour flight into Tokyo and implant
[16:37.320 --> 16:41.520]  most of the organs right there and there's a huge tourism, a medical tourism trade
[16:41.520 --> 16:46.360]  to go over there and they have the nerve and there's just one of the huge crimes China
[16:46.360 --> 16:53.760]  commits, the suicide nets, the forced abortions, the infanticide, the one child policy on and
[16:53.760 --> 17:02.640]  on, the 84 million killed by Mao Zedong alone, bearing his nightmare, what was his reign?
[17:02.640 --> 17:10.600]  He was over China 49 until the late 70s, under him 84 million, the Chinese government admits,
[17:10.600 --> 17:17.080]  you guys killed probably, just under Mao, four or five times what Hitler did, three times
[17:17.080 --> 17:25.240]  what Stalin and Lenin did together, you are the heavyweight champion mass murderers of
[17:25.240 --> 17:34.600]  world history, of your own people, most of them didn't even resist you and then you get
[17:34.600 --> 17:40.120]  up in the whole political correct racket and tell us Donald Trump is Hitler and let's
[17:40.120 --> 17:43.280]  get down to what the Ford Foundation is really saying there when they put that talking point
[17:43.280 --> 17:50.120]  out, they're saying if you're white you're Hitler, just like Obama said sorry I'm trying
[17:50.120 --> 17:55.080]  to appoint a white guy who's a horrible anti-gunner even worse than Kagan and so to my ear in many
[17:55.080 --> 17:59.520]  ways, I'm sorry he's white but he's the best jurist for the job, again the idea that white
[17:59.520 --> 18:04.920]  people are inherently bad, that's all they're selling is total vulcanization, get everybody's
[18:04.920 --> 18:09.000]  throat because we're bringing in hundreds of thousands of non-vetted refugees where they
[18:09.000 --> 18:13.360]  don't even check their IDs or passports in many cases, they won't even give the state
[18:13.360 --> 18:17.760]  governors their names, the state police their names for a database, the feds just turn them
[18:17.760 --> 18:21.960]  loose millions of them in Europe and he says you got to stop everybody coming in until
[18:21.960 --> 18:26.240]  we start vetting them again, yeah close the border till we turn the vetting back on that
[18:26.240 --> 18:31.080]  Obama's order turned off and they spin that, I saw an article in USA Today, I saw another
[18:31.080 --> 18:37.000]  one this morning in CNN about why New Yorkers are rejecting Trump, yeah that's why he's
[18:37.000 --> 18:42.840]  about to win by 60 points, it was like well this guy from Italy who's an African doesn't
[18:42.840 --> 18:46.640]  like him because he hates immigrants, Trump never says that immigrants are great, come
[18:46.640 --> 18:52.680]  here legally, and then it's this whole article about how hurt he is that Trump hates him
[18:52.680 --> 18:58.800]  and again that's the new titles in America of nobility, I get to be a victim, I get
[18:58.800 --> 19:03.600]  to be protected, I get to go around with a chip on my shoulder disliking everyone and
[19:03.600 --> 19:09.400]  sovereignty because I just listened to talking points to the media and decided to be but
[19:09.400 --> 19:15.360]  hurt and it's this whole religion where people collect like baseball cards, how they've been
[19:15.360 --> 19:20.560]  slided and how someone got in their way and you know that's why they're not successful,
[19:20.560 --> 19:26.280]  people get in my way, I just go over them, around them, through them, but frankly a lot
[19:26.280 --> 19:29.280]  of times I'll be exhausted and somebody tries to block what I'm doing, I just suddenly go
[19:29.280 --> 19:37.800]  oh my gosh I just got five hours of energy, it's called the animating contest of liberty,
[19:37.800 --> 19:43.000]  but no, no, no, let's not worry about the cancer viruses and the vaccines, the GMOs,
[19:43.000 --> 19:46.640]  the human cloning that's already going on everywhere, all of the craziness, the toxic
[19:46.640 --> 19:52.040]  waste dumping, let's worry about Donald Trump because the communist Chinese mass murderer
[19:52.040 --> 19:58.240]  grand champions who out Hitler Hitler by four to five times under one dictator, they say
[19:58.240 --> 19:59.240]  so.
[19:59.240 --> 20:05.120]  Hello, I'm Michael Reagan, my father president Ronald Reagan believes so strongly in gold
[20:05.120 --> 20:11.200]  that in 1985 he changed gold ownership forever, today our national debt is spiraling out of

[20:59.920 --> 21:04.440]  Something shocking just happened in a Coast Guard unit in San Diego, the old guys in the
[21:04.440 --> 21:10.040]  unit have turned the tables and are now destroying the young bucks in head to head fitness tests.
[21:10.040 --> 21:11.920]  How is this even possible?
[21:11.920 --> 21:15.640]  Turns out the old guys in this unit have been part of a special test group for a doctor
[21:15.640 --> 21:19.560]  formulated fountain of youth drink called Patriot Power Greens.
[21:19.560 --> 21:22.960]  Patriot Power Greens has been so effective for many of the older soldiers that it's

[21:37.480 --> 21:40.480]  specifically for our conservative friends.
[21:40.480 --> 21:44.640]  But you must act fast, do the high demand for members of the Coast Guard, our supply

[22:33.200 --> 22:35.600]  was when we said, ah, that's it, we're out.
[22:35.600 --> 22:37.680]  Loved my dad, but boy was he stubborn.
[22:37.680 --> 22:40.640]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[22:40.640 --> 22:41.640]  His excuse?
[22:41.640 --> 22:42.840]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[22:42.840 --> 22:44.440]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.

[23:57.760 --> 24:09.760]  We could not be forgotten, we won't be left behind, our demerits will all end for a while.
[24:09.760 --> 24:14.000]  Trump said, I'm so happy China is upset they have waged economic war against us.
[24:14.000 --> 24:16.040]  We're going to play that clip here in a moment.
[24:16.040 --> 24:22.240]  But first off, I want everybody out there, especially listeners we've had for 15 years,
[24:22.240 --> 24:28.040]  to do a huge victory lap right now, because if this information fully comes out, it will
[24:28.040 --> 24:36.200]  be a death blow to the New World Order corporate national security combined system that organizes
[24:36.200 --> 24:42.040]  terrorists, that protects terrorists, that funds and arms radical jihadists all over
[24:42.040 --> 24:48.600]  the world and other criminal groups and allows them to then attack or protects them and opens
[24:48.600 --> 24:53.720]  the door for them to attack or sometimes carries out the complete attack and then the affiliate
[24:53.720 --> 24:59.240]  group takes the credit, so that the West and the rest of the world can have whatever progress
[24:59.240 --> 25:06.000]  we've made towards due process and human liberty and privacy dismantled.
[25:06.000 --> 25:08.480]  And now the examples are completely naked.
[25:08.480 --> 25:12.640]  They think the public's so dumb and so illogical, totally out in the open.
[25:12.640 --> 25:17.600]  Europe brings in 5 million people in the last two years, mainly out of North Africa and
[25:17.600 --> 25:25.440]  Syria, a huge conduit of migrants, of invaders through the Middle East is allowed into Syria
[25:25.440 --> 25:33.840]  who borders Eastern Europe and Southern Europe and Turkey and allows them to then come in
[25:33.840 --> 25:40.960]  and have safe harbor and safe transport into Deutschland, France and other nations.
[25:40.960 --> 25:48.840]  They then trans ship through the EU system to the United States and the rest of the world.
[25:48.840 --> 25:52.600]  And they think we're so dumb when these groups start attacking, which they've done, and when
[25:52.600 --> 25:57.320]  they launch their huge jihad tent offensives that we know are coming in the future, civil
[25:57.320 --> 26:03.760]  emergency will be declared from the anniversary of the Boston bombing.
[26:03.760 --> 26:06.040]  The media claims that I say there was no bombing at all.
[26:06.040 --> 26:09.160]  I do not say that.
[26:09.160 --> 26:12.960]  Or they say that I claim mercenaries did it because people were wearing craft international
[26:12.960 --> 26:15.280]  style uniforms and punisher hats.
[26:15.280 --> 26:20.120]  I'm not saying craft international did that.
[26:20.120 --> 26:23.000]  I'm saying they were clearly there running some type of security.
[26:23.000 --> 26:26.520]  They knew something was coming and there was a drill going on that day.
[26:26.520 --> 26:32.280]  That cover for someone else to bomb it.
[26:32.280 --> 26:34.960]  And then it turned out the two brothers had CIA connections.
[26:34.960 --> 26:39.560]  The older one paid by the State Department through Georgetown University to travel undercover
[26:39.560 --> 26:47.480]  under a fake name to areas of southern Russia and into the stands like Chechnya.
[26:47.480 --> 26:51.840]  And Russia, two years before the Boston bombing, blew his cover.
[26:51.840 --> 26:56.680]  He was a boxer, playboy, cool guy.
[26:56.680 --> 26:57.680]  He got set up.
[26:57.680 --> 27:00.680]  We don't know exactly what happened.
[27:00.680 --> 27:03.640]  But that terror attack had false flag written all over it.
[27:03.640 --> 27:06.800]  But regardless, they're letting these people in en masse.
[27:06.800 --> 27:11.440]  San Bernardino, the major Hassan shooting Fort Hood, all of it.
[27:11.440 --> 27:14.960]  They keep trying to call it workplace violence.
[27:14.960 --> 27:19.680]  We're exposing that it's terror, but pointing out who opened the door.
[27:19.680 --> 27:21.120]  How does the mainstream media respond?
[27:21.120 --> 27:25.360]  They lie about what we've said.
[27:25.360 --> 27:30.560]  Just like I've been saying two months before 9-11, 15 years ago.
[27:30.560 --> 27:35.600]  And from the day it happened that NORAD stood down, they had drills that day.
[27:35.600 --> 27:38.120]  They ordered 15 of the 19 hijackers to be let in.
[27:38.120 --> 27:41.200]  I had the head of the embassy on months after 9-11.
[27:41.200 --> 27:48.120]  Mr. Springman who said they were told they were CIA and to let the hijackers in.
[27:48.120 --> 27:49.600]  And then the FBI tried to bust them.
[27:49.600 --> 27:50.920]  They were ordered to stand down.
[27:50.920 --> 27:52.280]  And there's more to the story than that.
[27:52.280 --> 27:54.840]  But we have NORAD ordered to stand down.
[27:54.840 --> 27:57.640]  We have the FAA ordered to stand down.
[27:57.640 --> 28:00.760]  We have the evidence.
[28:00.760 --> 28:01.760]  We know it happened.
[28:01.760 --> 28:07.160]  And the congressional commission, the 28 pages says there was a stand down order and
[28:07.160 --> 28:11.120]  an order afterwards to cover up the Saudi connection.
[28:11.120 --> 28:13.360]  We already know the FBI was ordered to do that.
[28:13.360 --> 28:15.200]  It was in the news at the time.
[28:15.200 --> 28:19.320]  I would hold up mainstream news when this stuff came out.
[28:19.320 --> 28:24.600]  When the media would say, oh, Alex isn't covering C-SPAN or the Associated Press, Alex is making
[28:24.600 --> 28:27.400]  it up.
[28:27.400 --> 28:30.760]  Just like they misrepresent what Donald Trump says.
[28:30.760 --> 28:35.440]  And now Donald Trump comes out a few months ago and says the Saudis were involved in 9-11
[28:35.440 --> 28:37.480]  and I'm going to expose the 28 pages.
[28:37.480 --> 28:42.080]  And all of you pushing over these years, and Congressman Walter Jones has come on probably
[28:42.080 --> 28:46.000]  20 times the last four or five years trying to get his bill passed to release this, is
[28:46.000 --> 28:50.680]  now inches away from it coming out unredacted.
[28:50.680 --> 28:52.800]  People say, well, there's going to be more to it than that.
[28:52.800 --> 28:56.520]  Yes, but this is like getting Al Capone on income tax evasion.
[28:56.520 --> 28:59.520]  Then you get him for everything else.
[28:59.520 --> 29:03.240]  Member of the mainstream media, Donald Trump suggested Saudi Arabia was behind 9-11 multiple
[29:03.240 --> 29:05.160]  times Wednesday.
[29:05.160 --> 29:06.680]  That was two months ago.
[29:06.680 --> 29:08.520]  Let's go back to the date there.
[29:08.520 --> 29:09.520]  Scroll back up for me, please.
[29:09.520 --> 29:11.480]  For radio listeners, you can go see this.
[29:11.480 --> 29:16.480]  Back to the New York Daily News, February 17th.
[29:16.480 --> 29:19.440]  Oh, how dare him.
[29:19.440 --> 29:21.520]  Oh, Donald Trump was right again.
[29:21.520 --> 29:25.160]  And look for Donald Trump to come out and say, see, I was right.
[29:25.160 --> 29:31.160]  See, I told you.
[29:31.160 --> 29:38.160]  Oh, man.
[29:38.160 --> 29:41.440]  Oh, Donald Trump, folks.
[29:41.440 --> 29:44.880]  The Sleeper Cell Patriot.
[29:44.880 --> 29:49.080]  That's why they're so scared of him.
[29:49.080 --> 29:50.360]  We're on the march.
[29:50.360 --> 29:52.800]  The Empire's on the run.
[29:52.800 --> 29:59.640]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[29:59.640 --> 30:02.360]  The day is Monday, April 18th, and here's some of the latest news.
[30:02.360 --> 30:05.720]  It's now known that the Colorado lawmakers who voted to scrap the state primary in fact
[30:05.720 --> 30:06.720]  had Cruz Delegates.
[30:06.720 --> 30:10.160]  Four state Republicans voted against the bill that would allow Colorado voters a chance
[30:10.160 --> 30:11.800]  to vote in a presidential primary.
[30:11.800 --> 30:15.440]  And all of them are Cruz supporters, with three of them listed as members of Cruz's Colorado
[30:15.440 --> 30:16.440]  leadership team.
[30:16.440 --> 30:20.480]  And one of them, Senator Kevin Grantam, even had the audacity to brag about Cruz's quote
[30:20.480 --> 30:24.120]  victory on Twitter despite the fact that the voters did not get to pick a candidate.
[30:24.120 --> 30:28.120]  In other news, only 6% of people trust the mainstream media, putting the industry about
[30:28.120 --> 30:31.840]  equal to Congress and well below the public's view of other organizations.
[30:31.840 --> 30:35.720]  This lack of confidence in establishment media is fueled by an accuracy in reporting and
[30:35.720 --> 30:36.720]  deceptive bias.
[30:36.720 --> 30:41.720]  Another study revealed that only 45% of Americans, over $77 million, will not pay an income tax
[30:41.720 --> 30:45.360]  this year because they have no taxable income or they receive enough tax breaks to raise
[30:45.360 --> 30:46.360]  their liability.
[30:46.360 --> 30:48.880]  This says a lot about the current decline of the economy.
[30:48.880 --> 30:53.440]  You'd expect less tax revenue as more Americans leave the job market or stay underemployed
[30:53.440 --> 30:54.440]  at part-time jobs.

[31:27.400 --> 31:32.720]  You will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue, used since
[31:32.720 --> 31:37.880]  before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems and enhance overall
[31:37.880 --> 31:38.880]  Health.
[31:38.880 --> 31:42.500]  Wild crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the
[31:42.500 --> 31:45.100]  most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[31:45.100 --> 31:50.800]  This winter season it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.

[31:58.680 --> 32:03.240]  Hey, how you doing? Good brother. Just recently started using your products. Everything you
[32:03.240 --> 32:07.400]  said about them is correct. Me and my wife both use a lot of them and it's made a lot
[32:07.400 --> 32:11.120]  of changes in our lives here. Well thank you brother, it's because it also funds our operation
[32:11.120 --> 32:15.840]  but doing that I know I've got to have the highest quality. Supermail vitality was developed
[32:15.840 --> 32:22.080]  to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals. We did
[32:22.080 --> 32:27.040]  the supermail and the super female vitality, big changes, a lot of energy, we've gotten
[32:27.040 --> 32:31.600]  off the cheap energy drinks, energy shots, they've got a ton of money there. Sourced
[32:31.600 --> 32:38.080]  from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet and then concentrated or maximum
[32:38.080 --> 32:42.600]  potency. They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that
[32:42.600 --> 32:46.880]  up for a while but then burn you out in my experience whereas stuff that gets your glands
[32:46.880 --> 32:51.360]  naturally going goes right to the source. So it's pretty exciting and I love it. Visit
[32:51.360 --> 32:57.280]  infowarslife.com today to secure your supermail vitality and other powerful products from

[32:58.280 --> 33:07.640]  Hi, I'm Janet Napolitano, Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. Homeland
[33:07.640 --> 33:18.080]  security begins with hometown security. It seems apparent that our citizens are staying
[33:18.080 --> 33:25.360]  off the streets which may make scarring particularly difficult even with this year's rule changes
[33:25.360 --> 33:34.520]  to recap those revisions. Women are still worth 10 points more than men in all age brackets
[33:34.520 --> 33:43.680]  but teenagers now rack up 40 points and toddlers under 12 now rate a big 70 points. The big
[33:43.680 --> 33:55.800]  score, anyone, any sex, over 75 years old has been up to 100 points. As always, how fast
[33:55.800 --> 34:07.560]  you move determines how long you'll live. Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[34:07.560 --> 34:18.720]  It's Alex Jones. That intro's about four years old. John Baum put it together. Remember
[34:18.720 --> 34:24.080]  when Homeland security ordered 3 million life-sized targets of little children and women in the
[34:24.080 --> 34:30.000]  shower and old people? So we simply took those news articles, well we broke the news about
[34:30.000 --> 34:34.200]  it, showed the articles, if you're a radio listener, I'm describing what people just
[34:34.200 --> 34:42.480]  saw and then cut it together with Death Race 2000, the David Carradine, Sylvester Stallone
[34:42.480 --> 34:48.080]  and others. Man, that's a really good movie. Breaking down the future dystopia we would
[34:48.080 --> 34:55.160]  live in under a depopulation agenda. And as usual, the faster you are, the longer you
[34:55.160 --> 35:05.160]  live. Again, not bragging, I want to give everybody hope because there is a lot of hope
[35:05.160 --> 35:13.280]  there. The talking points we put out sometimes take 15 years to bear fruit but we can directly
[35:13.280 --> 35:20.600]  follow the line of this audience at the very heart of 9-Eleven Truth, the demonization
[35:20.600 --> 35:25.920]  we went under, the misrepresentation we went under, the attacks we went under, the monetary
[35:25.920 --> 35:34.600]  attack we went under. I had over 120 affiliates at the time and the program director came
[35:34.600 --> 35:40.400]  to Ted and said we're losing all of our affiliates. Alex's show is exploding. I was like 27 years
[35:40.400 --> 35:47.600]  old. He keeps saying it's an inside job and I can't get him to stop doing it and the
[35:47.600 --> 35:53.840]  stations are turning him off. And Ted Anderson called me and he said I tell you what, Alex,
[35:53.840 --> 35:57.600]  when I first hired you you were only on a couple of stations and so you're losing most
[35:57.600 --> 36:05.040]  your stations but if you want to do that, go ahead. And I did because I knew that there
[36:05.040 --> 36:09.760]  were criminal elements in our government working with Saudi Arabia and Jihadist just like they
[36:09.760 --> 36:15.160]  do in Syria, just like they do in Libya today and in Europe, Merkel and Aland. And I knew
[36:15.160 --> 36:23.080]  I had to morally tell the truth. It didn't matter. And people were amazed by that. That
[36:23.080 --> 36:29.520]  my show just out of nowhere was one of the fastest growing in radio history. 27 years
[36:29.520 --> 36:39.520]  old. 26 years old. It was 15 years ago. I'm 42 today. I'd already been on there like four
[36:39.520 --> 36:47.120]  years, five years. Already paid my dues and it was exploding and it was not hard to say
[36:47.120 --> 36:54.760]  no and do the right thing. I mean, I saw them that day on television and I heard them on
[36:54.760 --> 37:02.040]  CBS radio say we're going to demolition building 7, the Solomon Brothers building. And then
[37:02.040 --> 37:05.880]  I went on air and said they said they were going to blow it up and then people said that
[37:05.880 --> 37:11.280]  I was lying. It took years for the Internet Archive to get good enough to where CNN and
[37:11.280 --> 37:17.200]  ABC and NBC and BBC started uploading their full coverage of 9-11 to the Internet and
[37:17.200 --> 37:22.200]  it was all on tape on newscasts or newscasts. We're going to blow it up. We've got the explosives
[37:22.200 --> 37:25.880]  inside. We're going to bring it down. And then I interviewed the emergency manager,
[37:25.880 --> 37:30.600]  the deputy emergency manager, and he said no, there were bombs. They told us get out
[37:30.600 --> 37:36.840]  and then they killed him two weeks later. I mean, I'm just supposed to shut up about
[37:36.840 --> 37:46.760]  that. And then a lot of folks out there say, Jones, why don't you cover 9-11 truth more?
[37:46.760 --> 37:50.960]  It's like one of these little moral scoreboard things that, you know, anybody out there can
[37:50.960 --> 37:54.800]  make themselves better than the evil Alex Jones and say, Jones isn't the father of
[37:54.800 --> 37:58.680]  9-11 truth. Jones isn't the progenitor of it all. Jones isn't the guy that questioned
[37:58.680 --> 38:03.520]  it before, on the day, and after. And that hammered it and made a whole bunch of films
[38:03.520 --> 38:07.200]  about it and wrote a book about it and had all these guests on and put on huge 9-11 events
[38:07.200 --> 38:13.760]  in L.A. with thousands of people for the first time on C-SPAN. No, no, no. He's the one covering
[38:13.760 --> 38:21.560]  it up because he doesn't cover it every day or let somebody call him up and bully him saying,
[38:21.560 --> 38:24.640]  have me on, space beams did it. If you don't agree with me or with the government, you
[38:24.640 --> 38:33.560]  know, all this mental illness. I haven't spent most of my time on 9-11 in five or six years
[38:33.560 --> 38:39.280]  because worldwide it's already well known. The 28 pages are being exposed. I knew there
[38:39.280 --> 38:44.920]  was a movement that would end up bringing it all out. I'd already in my bombing run imagined
[38:44.920 --> 38:49.480]  like I'm a high tech or this operation is a high tech B3 bomber going mock five loaded
[38:49.480 --> 38:55.480]  with bombs and I've got a bunch of cities to hit, a bunch of lies to blow. And I'm going
[38:55.480 --> 38:59.760]  to target, drop, make sure I hit target, accelerate on to the next target. And while folks are
[38:59.760 --> 39:04.680]  back there looking at the wreckage of the enemy operation, I'm going to be six, seven,
[39:04.680 --> 39:12.680]  eight, nine, 10 targets up blasting and doing maneuvers and the sand missiles, you know,
[39:12.680 --> 39:16.360]  barely hitting us. I mean, seriously, I'm talking infiltrators, you're going to get
[39:16.360 --> 39:22.200]  in the real world, black ops, dirty tricks, but incredible Providence folks, incredible
[39:22.200 --> 39:27.560]  Providence. But my life behind the scenes is like a James Bond movie. Many times might
[39:27.560 --> 39:32.480]  be totally still for six months and then all hell breaks loose. And I've just never seen
[39:32.480 --> 39:37.560]  such Providence as it all blows up in the enemy's face. It's amazing. But just know
[39:37.560 --> 39:42.280]  this, you deserve the credit as the listeners, the viewers, the activists. And I know you
[39:42.280 --> 39:46.920]  don't want credit. You want justice and liberty and freedom. But just understand you got ridiculed
[39:46.920 --> 39:50.960]  for talking about 9 11 truth. You got demonized and Fox News was saying anybody that talked
[39:50.960 --> 39:55.480]  about it should be arrested. You went through hell and you deserve just as much credit as
[39:55.480 --> 40:00.280]  we do. But at the same time, I've always been so focused on the next mission that I never
[40:00.280 --> 40:07.040]  get up here and celebrate the victories we've had and the amazing successes we've had together
[40:07.040 --> 40:11.600]  as a liberty movement. And all of you out there as activists and radio hosts and filmmakers
[40:11.600 --> 40:18.280]  and authors and researchers and everything you've gone through, I salute you from Alex
[40:18.280 --> 40:22.920]  Jones to you. You're my hero. That's why I don't want you calling up telling me how
[40:22.920 --> 40:29.560]  great I am. I've done my duty and it is very humbling to have such good people look up
[40:29.560 --> 40:34.520]  to me. Listen, I look up to you and we're all in this together, brothers and sisters,
[40:34.520 --> 40:39.280]  regardless of race, color, creed, religion, you name it. We love truth and we're standing
[40:39.280 --> 40:46.360]  up for justice and history has proven. As Martin Luther King Jr. said, the universe
[40:46.360 --> 40:53.160]  bends towards justice. There is Providence. And what people don't understand is the secret
[40:53.160 --> 40:56.520]  hidden stuff taught on Oprah Winfrey, where you just magically believe something and it
[40:56.520 --> 41:02.120]  happens. You've got to have the infrastructure, the people, justice on your side and the will
[41:02.120 --> 41:09.360]  and the perseverance and then, then you can do almost anything. It's true. Look, humans
[41:09.360 --> 41:13.840]  envision things and then a few decades later, their reality. We are incredible creatures
[41:13.840 --> 41:21.080]  made in the image of the creator, but you don't fully activate as a soul and as an intellect
[41:21.080 --> 41:26.200]  and as a mind and as a people until you're put through the fire and until you have stood
[41:26.200 --> 41:35.320]  up against evil and every level I go up fighting evil, just more opens up and it's like the
[41:35.320 --> 41:40.040]  knowledge intensifies to the point of just, it's just too much. It's like that Moby's
[41:40.040 --> 41:46.480]  song. We got to go out with it. We've got to dissolve for a music. I forget the name
[41:46.480 --> 41:53.560]  of the song. It's like, I would stand in line for this. Yeah. There's always time and life
[41:53.560 --> 41:59.080]  for this extreme ways. Yeah. There's a line of the song about, you know, I had to shut
[41:59.080 --> 42:05.840]  my mind down. I couldn't, couldn't handle it too much and I couldn't think too little
[42:05.840 --> 42:09.400]  and I was basically a zombie. I forget the exact exact words to it and that's what it
[42:09.400 --> 42:14.960]  comes down to. But we're changing the world right now because we have the narrative. We
[42:14.960 --> 42:21.640]  actually know what's going on. We know how the enemy operates. We understand their criminology.
[42:21.640 --> 42:25.560]  We understand what their goals are. We understand what their next moves are going to be and
[42:25.560 --> 42:29.320]  we've now reached a point where the enemy is still operating out in the open thinking
[42:29.320 --> 42:35.600]  that we're not going to resist them or say no to their, their operations. So if I impart
[42:35.600 --> 42:41.360]  anything to you, it's this, because you sure teach me a lot. It's that you have incredible
[42:41.360 --> 42:45.640]  power. You are the engine of human liberty worldwide. And let me tell you the listeners
[42:45.640 --> 42:50.800]  of this broadcast, you are the front line. You are the tip of the spear. You were the
[42:50.800 --> 42:56.280]  eyes and ears of humanity. You're the people for your background, your genetics, your religious
[42:56.280 --> 43:01.120]  experiences, your spiritual experiences. For whatever reason, you're the people in this
[43:01.120 --> 43:08.260]  time and place, the biggest assemblage of awakened people to the technocratic globalist
[43:08.260 --> 43:13.920]  anti-human takeover. That's why I say look in the mirror. It's not a tagline. It's not
[43:13.920 --> 43:20.480]  a logo. It's not a cool saying. It's the truth. Look in the mirror because you are the
[43:20.480 --> 43:32.360]  resistance. And the answer to their 1984 society is 1776. That's why the enemy said everything
[43:32.360 --> 43:37.400]  they can to dumb us down and poison us and physically poison us with chemicals and biologicals
[43:37.400 --> 43:44.160]  but also culturally poison us. Lord knows I've been poisoned. Good Lord. But I still
[43:44.160 --> 43:48.160]  have my soul and my heart focused on God and I know the way out of this and I'm stumbling
[43:48.160 --> 43:53.640]  through this fight but I'm telling you. Somebody who loves God and loves the truth, stumbling
[43:53.640 --> 44:02.840]  on their knees is a giant compared to these evil people. Greedy, self-serving and hateful.
[44:02.840 --> 44:08.440]  They have no empathy. They have no love of humanity and they know we do so they tailor
[44:08.440 --> 44:14.360]  their propaganda around love and the fraternity of humans together and all they're doing
[44:14.360 --> 44:24.560]  is trying to kill, still destroy. These people are devils. And I mean literal devils because
[44:24.560 --> 44:31.240]  they've manifested themselves as devilish creatures. I saw the White House run Right
[44:31.240 --> 44:36.080]  Wing Watch and the White House run Media Matters this weekend and my Google Alerts saying
[44:36.080 --> 44:42.480]  Jones now thinks it's the end times. Ha ha ha. Laugh at me. And then you know they've
[44:42.480 --> 44:46.400]  got other alerts. Trump's a cook. He says Saudi Arabia was involved in 9-11. You know
[44:46.400 --> 44:50.400]  they'll say something such as a cook. They say the sun's yellow at high noon and a clear
[44:50.400 --> 45:01.400]  sky. So they take the most obvious stuff and then they make a big joke out of it. Like
[45:01.400 --> 45:05.960]  they're the high authority reporting on us and my whole rant was about even if you don't
[45:05.960 --> 45:14.240]  believe in God. The genetic engineering, the chimeras, the manipulation of the environment,
[45:14.240 --> 45:19.640]  the geoengineering, the world government, phasing out of cash, the elites saying they're
[45:19.640 --> 45:23.960]  going to merge with machines and become gods. It was all about the fact that boy that sounds
[45:23.960 --> 45:28.120]  like the end times to me and if they've got enough nuclear weapons to destroy the world
[45:28.120 --> 45:31.960]  dozens of times over and we end up having a nuclear war which the Pentagon says we're
[45:31.960 --> 45:37.440]  in more danger of now than during the Cuban Missile Crisis. We could make our own Armageddon
[45:37.440 --> 45:42.240]  whether the Bible's true or not. We need to have some restraint and not do this and then
[45:42.240 --> 45:47.520]  I saw the restraint. How creepy is it that those organizations are admittedly run by
[45:47.520 --> 45:51.200]  the White House and get their talking points from them and the White House is worried about
[45:51.200 --> 46:00.600]  making fun of me saying we need to not blow the earth up? That's what I mean. They all
[46:00.600 --> 46:09.080]  have this giggling demonic attitude like everything's funny and nothing serious. But when they
[46:09.080 --> 46:17.440]  get diagnosed with cancer at 35 or 40 years old, the slacker outfit, the trendy outfit
[46:17.440 --> 46:22.880]  and the trendy nomenclature, it ain't going to get you out of it. And if we have a nuclear
[46:22.880 --> 46:28.640]  war, that's not going to, you know, be in trendy and using the proper language systems
[46:28.640 --> 46:32.360]  in your cult isn't going to protect you. And I'm reaching out to you as fellow humans
[46:32.360 --> 46:37.080]  and saying what is your problem? And I realize the problem. They can always find somebody
[46:37.080 --> 46:45.480]  to take that position and take that place. They can always find sociopaths and evil people
[46:45.480 --> 46:50.040]  that are willing to prey on their fellow humans. But it is a giant victory. It's a devastating
[46:50.040 --> 46:58.000]  victory that they have New York Daily News headlines. How the U.S. government covered
[46:58.000 --> 47:03.880]  up Saudi role in 9-11. That's a headline. Secret 28 pages of 9-11 report under new scrutiny.
[47:03.880 --> 47:07.560]  Saudi Arabia threatens to pull 750 billion from U.S. economy if Congress allows them
[47:07.560 --> 47:13.360]  to be sued for 9-11 terror attacks. How the U.S. covered up Saudi role in 9-11. New York
[47:13.360 --> 47:21.400]  Post. Saudi Arabia warns of economic fallout. If Congress passes 9-11 bill, that just releases
[47:21.400 --> 47:27.720]  that congressional report. That Saudi Arabia holding us hostage again, threatening economic
[47:27.720 --> 47:37.080]  armageddon. Look at how much control we're already under with the Saudi sea. See how far
[47:37.080 --> 47:40.880]  down they've taken us and the communist Chinese. They all say we can't have Trump. They're
[47:40.880 --> 47:47.320]  also mad at Trump because he dare talk about 9-11 truth. You see. I'm going to go to break
[47:47.320 --> 47:51.000]  and come back and play Trump talking about the communist Chinese and how they're in economic
[47:51.000 --> 47:57.040]  war with us. Yes. And then with elites here that make deals with them to pass rules and
[47:57.040 --> 48:07.280]  laws making it impossible for us to compete. Remember that guy named Pacharya over in India
[48:07.280 --> 48:14.400]  who was running the U.N. carbon program. And it turned out his son owned the new multi-hundred
[48:14.400 --> 48:19.520]  million dollar coal-fired plant that was also going to have a steel mill operating off of
[48:19.520 --> 48:27.120]  it. And they even made a carbon deal with the last steel mill and the last coal plant
[48:27.120 --> 48:33.480]  in Sheffield, England. Sheffield Steel moved to India. And then it came out he was getting
[48:33.480 --> 48:39.160]  the money for it. And so he had to step down. This is literally trading and selling out
[48:39.160 --> 48:43.000]  and the politicians get five, ten million dollars and you get a hundred million billion
[48:43.000 --> 48:48.000]  dollar plant in your country. They're selling us out so cheap. They're not making bad deals
[48:48.000 --> 48:52.240]  like Trump says. They're making deals to sink this country because they're globalists.
[48:52.240 --> 48:58.440]  They want to bring us down. Speaking of economic warfare, shop local. Shop USA as much as you
[48:58.440 --> 49:02.520]  can. Nobody's perfect. Hardly anything's made here. Support local communities. Go to the
[49:02.520 --> 49:08.400]  farmer's market. Plant a garden. That's how we bring America back is learning basic self-sufficiency
[49:08.400 --> 49:14.120]  activities. They don't want us to be able to take care of ourselves. We have a special

[50:17.560 --> 50:27.200]  deeply and with truth sabotaging them at every level. And doing things that down the road,
[50:27.200 --> 50:30.880]  you see, just like Force 10 from Navarone, I've explained that allegory where they bomb
[50:30.880 --> 50:37.480]  the dam. And it's the sequel of Force 10 Navarone and it doesn't collapse right away
[50:37.480 --> 50:41.280]  and they're getting up and just give it a minute. And that's what I keep explaining
[50:41.280 --> 50:46.840]  to everybody. We're doing things that have already destroyed the globalist. Now there
[50:46.840 --> 50:50.120]  may be some new group that rises up and that's why they want to keep building the system,
[50:50.120 --> 50:54.720]  but believe me, we've devastated the national security combine, run by foreign institutions,
[50:54.720 --> 50:58.480]  we've devastated the New World Order, the globalist, a pan-Arab alliance, all of it's
[50:58.480 --> 50:59.480]  coming down.

[54:14.520 --> 54:19.760]  We're starting a new meme. It's up at Real Alex Jones on Twitter. We're going to post
[54:19.760 --> 54:23.720]  an article at infowars.com and welcome you to send your memes in. We'll post them as
[54:23.720 --> 54:29.560]  well. At least the good ones. But everybody wins engaging in the info war. And so for
[54:29.560 --> 54:33.880]  radio listeners, I'll go ahead and read the meme out. TV viewers already saw it, obviously.
[54:33.880 --> 54:38.280]  We'll put that back on screen. Kit Daniels came up with the idea. The truth about Ted
[54:38.280 --> 54:44.800]  Cruz in one image. And it's at Real Donald Trump and at Drudge. We just tweeted it there.
[54:44.800 --> 54:53.120]  It's up on Real Alex Jones right now. And at Kit Daniels 1776. These men all agree.
[54:53.120 --> 55:03.320]  Voterless elections work. That's right. These men all agree. Mao Zedong. Saddam Hussein.
[55:03.320 --> 55:08.600]  Joseph Stalin. And quite frankly, I really don't think Saddam Hussein even deserves to
[55:08.600 --> 55:12.280]  be up there. I'm not saying he was a good guy, but he was shut up by the CIA and stabilized
[55:12.280 --> 55:16.600]  the whole area and took out all the radical jihadis and let women go to college and listen
[55:16.600 --> 55:21.640]  to rock and roll on the radio. And they really set him up. Let's just say this. He's evil.
[55:21.640 --> 55:24.960]  Compare people that set him up in our government. He's an angel. The media will say I said he's
[55:24.960 --> 55:28.600]  an angel. No, I said he's evil. But compared to them, he's an angel. So let's put that
[55:28.600 --> 55:32.440]  meme back up there, folks. The power of you, the people. Let's go with this. These men
[55:32.440 --> 55:36.000]  all agree. Voterless elections work. And just all the different dictators, all the different
[55:36.000 --> 55:40.520]  tyrants, all the different. You could put LBJ up there who famously stole his way into
[55:40.520 --> 55:48.280]  the Texas delegation for Congress. We just tweeted that out. Let's see that go mega viral.
[55:48.280 --> 55:52.880]  Also, if you want to stay in contact with us, the censorship intensifies. You want to get
[55:52.880 --> 55:57.560]  exclusive videos, exclusive audio, exclusive articles. You want to be part of the info

[56:07.040 --> 56:15.200]  in contact with you. So even the Daily Mail gets it. Cruz claims he's won landslides over
[56:15.200 --> 56:21.320]  and over beating Trump in five consecutive states, even though only one of them held
[56:21.320 --> 56:25.440]  an election. That's right. See, the Daily Mail and others are now picking up on the fact
[56:25.440 --> 56:31.280]  he keeps calling it landslide and democracy and voter revolt and grassroots uprising.
[56:31.280 --> 56:36.240]  These are quotes. It's not grassroots uprising when they cancel an election and then have
[56:36.240 --> 56:41.040]  party delegates selected by the upper party members vote and then you act like voters
[56:41.040 --> 56:46.640]  voted and he goes on Glenn Beck and goes, he's just mad. I want all the votes. You're not
[56:46.640 --> 56:54.680]  telling him it's super delegates Cruz. The reason he's going to have a landslide in
[56:54.680 --> 56:59.120]  New York, not just his home state, but because he gets to have a popular vote there. But
[56:59.120 --> 57:02.620]  in other states where he won, they're taking the delegates afterwards. Let's go out to
[57:02.620 --> 57:07.440]  break though with Trump saying, I'm so happy. China's upset. They have waged economic war
[57:07.440 --> 57:14.840]  against us. Yes, it's war. Here it is today on the top of drugs. Matt Drudge is a phenomenal
[57:14.840 --> 57:21.960]  person or phenomenal guy. It's a big deal. Top of drugs. China is upset with Donald Trump.
[57:21.960 --> 57:27.200]  How dare them? So they go. They're upset. No, here's the story. The biggest story top
[57:27.200 --> 57:32.960]  of drugs. Big story. China is upset because of the way Donald Trump is talking about trade
[57:32.960 --> 57:37.800]  with China. They're ripping us off, folks. It's time. I'm so happy they're upset. They
[57:37.800 --> 57:47.960]  haven't been upset with us in 30 years. They're never upset. It's so racist. They have a trade
[57:47.960 --> 57:56.960]  deficit with China of $500 billion a year. Okay. They tax and you know, they said we're
[57:56.960 --> 58:01.360]  not living up to treaties. They're the ones that don't live up to the agreements because
[58:01.360 --> 58:06.240]  they tax. I have friends and manufacturers. They can't get their product into China. And
[58:06.240 --> 58:10.880]  when they do, they have to pay a tax on it. And let me tell you, it's them. That's the
[58:10.880 --> 58:14.800]  problem. And they're going to treat us fairly and they're going to treat us justly or it's
[58:14.800 --> 58:21.600]  bye bye. Bye bye. We get things going fast. And you have to look at my answer. My response
[58:21.600 --> 58:24.760]  we're going to go to break. We'll go ahead and fade this down. That's why they hating.
[58:24.760 --> 58:29.080]  These are nationalists. They have a 35 to 40% tariff at berries on their currency on
[58:29.080 --> 58:33.160]  us where we can't compete. It's a total screw job. It's why we've been deindustrialized,
[58:33.160 --> 58:38.760]  but it's part of a plan to make us helpless. And Trump doesn't like it. So he's Hitler
[58:38.760 --> 58:43.040]  by the people that killed more than Hitler ever did. It's a joke. The communist Chinese
[58:43.040 --> 58:46.600]  don't like Donald Trump. What does that tell you?

[01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:06.680]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show because there's
[01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:11.160]  a war on for your mind.
[01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:18.400]  Globalism is about training a country that you're broke back, you have no rights and
[01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:24.400]  you have terms dictated to you by gangs of multinational combines, megacorporations and
[01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:28.120]  the banks that own and control it through fraud. You know, the big six banks, the big
[01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:32.320]  five banks that package the same mortgage they don't even own and sell it up to a hundred
[01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:37.280]  times and don't get in trouble for mass total fraud. These are these are Bernie Madoff
[01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:42.920]  scams thousands of times bigger that have taken the world over through fraud and now
[01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:48.120]  the communist Chinese are saying we can't have Trump and he's an enemy and Trump comes
[01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:52.000]  out and says you've hijacked our country, you have unfair trade deals, huge currency
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.400]  tariffs on us bare minimum, no environmental standards, there's no way we compete with
[01:00:55.400 --> 01:01:00.440]  you. We're not against you but you can't screw us and have a 400 to 500 billion dollar
[01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:03.000]  a year trade deficit.
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:08.360]  He Watson has a new article info wars.com this article needs to go viral. Chinese government
[01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:14.840]  official Trump presidency would mean us no longer a superpower. Chinese Finance Minister
[01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:20.400]  calls Trump an irrational type. Trump says China has waged economic war on us. China
[01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:25.520]  sells its political peaceful dissidents organs and then calls him in the people's daily
[01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:32.680]  Hitler. Let me tell you China the communist Chinese wish they were as nice as Hitler
[01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:41.640]  literally Hitler may have killed if you know some people he actually killed maybe seven
[01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:46.480]  eight million people that you know that they actually took and that weren't military combatants
[01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:54.640]  and killed. They killed though about 20 million Russians died but a lot of starvation things
[01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:58.280]  but let's just say he killed 20 million Russians and other seven eight million other people
[01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:03.760]  let's just say 27 million people that's on the high end. Hitler bad guy. I almost don't
[01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:08.160]  exist because of Hitler. I don't just mean George Soros is former operatives trying to
[01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:11.600]  shut me down and things but my grandfather's post almost died fighting Hitler that's why
[01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:15.680]  the ADL you know tries to make up stuff about me and Hitler because there's actually five
[01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:19.960]  Hitler if I was George Soros or Arnold Schwarzenegger going around wearing actual Nazi outfits
[01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:24.600]  it'd be okay. Seriously I mean if you're a Nazis you get like awards and stuff from
[01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:30.560]  them but if you almost don't exist because of the Nazis you know you're with them but
[01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:39.240]  there it is Chinese government official Trump presidency would mean US no longer a superpower.
[01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:44.920]  So Hitler kills 27 million and then Mao kills 84 million where the Chinese communists themselves
[01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:50.200]  and then of course they've killed tens of millions since then. So these are the biggest most
[01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:56.160]  bloodthirsty hateful evil people in the world. Criticize the government five years forced
[01:02:56.160 --> 01:03:02.480]  labor camp do it again they sell your organs and they're gonna sit there with a straight
[01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:09.040]  face the North Korea the big North Korea that's what China is and lecture us about who we
[01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:15.720]  can have and the average trendy loves being lectured by the Pope. I saw an article last
[01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:21.400]  week I didn't get to where Bernie Sanders went to the Vatican wall and it said Bernie
[01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:28.720]  Sanders did a press conference I saw the headline never saw the video from the Vatican wall
[01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:34.640]  and praise the Pope on letting in immigrants. They got a 200 foot wall there yeah there
[01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:44.840]  it is. Sanders greets supporters at the Vatican. You got two atheist dirtbag communists. See
[01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:48.960]  that's a commie command base now the Vatican so he loves it and there he is below one of
[01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:56.320]  their smaller 50 foot walls. The headline is so it's such an oxymoron. I want to praise
[01:03:56.320 --> 01:04:04.560]  you at your giant wall to call for the borders but no one inside your old city and Trump
[01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:13.600]  is a very dangerous person. There it is outside Vatican walls it's just the hypocrisy of these
[01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:20.720]  people has reached a new level but see they mean to have hypocrisy they want oxymorons
[01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:28.040]  they want to destroy logic. Truth is a menace and logic is a crime. In fact we should probably
[01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:36.680]  come in with the obsolete man with Rod Serling. You walk into this room you walk into a world
[01:04:36.680 --> 01:04:42.320]  run by the globe where your intellect is seen as competition and you're slated from birth
[01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:48.920]  to be turned into a drooling zombie. Well guess what this world's almost complete but
[01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:55.760]  it's got a demolition filing for the near future and on the tickets that hangs on its
[01:04:55.760 --> 01:05:01.240]  toe it says New World Order dead on arrival. The day is Monday April 18th and here's some
[01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:04.720]  of the latest news. It's now known that the Colorado lawmakers voted to scrap the state
[01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:08.400]  primary and in fact had Cruz Delegates. Four state Republicans voted against the bill that
[01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:12.120]  would allow Colorado voters a chance to vote in a presidential primary and all of them
[01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:16.320]  are Cruz supporters with three of them listed as members of Cruz's Colorado leadership team
[01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:20.360]  and one of them Senator Kevin Grantham even had the audacity to brag about Cruz's quote
[01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:24.000]  victory on Twitter despite the fact that the voters did not get to pick a candidate. In
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:28.920]  other news only 6% of people trust the mainstream media putting the industry about equal to Congress
[01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:32.720]  and well below the public's view of other organizations. This lack of confidence in
[01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:36.920]  establishment media is fueled by an accurate season reporting and deceptive bias. Another
[01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:41.560]  study revealed that only 45% of Americans over 77 million will not pay an income tax
[01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:45.240]  this year because they have no taxable income or they receive enough tax breaks to raise
[01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:49.240]  their liability. This says a lot about the current decline of the economy. You'd expect
[01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:53.920]  less tax revenue as more Americans leave the job market or stay underemployed at part-time
[01:05:53.920 --> 01:06:19.920]  jobs. For more news and reports visit infowars.com. This is Kit Daniels reporting.

[01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:11.920]  it leads to the future. Not a future that will be but one that might be. This is not
[01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:18.680]  a new world. It is simply an extension of what began in the old one. It has patterned
[01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:23.440]  itself after every dictator who has ever planted the ripping imprint of a boot on the pages
[01:08:23.440 --> 01:08:29.680]  of history since the beginning of time. It has refinements, technological advances and
[01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:35.640]  a more sophisticated approach to the destruction of human freedom. But like every one of the
[01:08:35.640 --> 01:08:42.120]  super states that preceded it, it has one iron rule. Logic is an enemy and truth is
[01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:51.180]  a menace. This is Mr. Romney Wordsworth in his last
[01:08:51.180 --> 01:08:57.440]  48 hours on earth. He's a citizen of the state but will soon have to be eliminated
[01:08:57.440 --> 01:09:03.440]  because he is built out of flesh and because he has a mind. Mr. Romney Wordsworth who will
[01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:13.160]  draw his last breaths in the twilight zone.

[01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:50.280]  against the internet against talk radio against filmmakers now not just here but all over
[01:09:50.280 --> 01:09:55.280]  the western world. There is a concerted effort by both political parties in this country
[01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:59.560]  to complete the bankruptcy of this country and to roll us into a world government to
[01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:06.480]  transfer our governmental powers to the non-elected IMF World Bank and of course the World Trade
[01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:16.160]  Organization under agreements like the NAU, EU and TPP systems. The good news is Donald
[01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:24.480]  Trump's coming out and saying China with 35 to 40% currency tariffs on our goods is devastating
[01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:29.400]  this nation by design and economic warfare. He's telling the truth. Donald Trump is coming
[01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:34.120]  out and of course saying the Saudis were heavily involved in 9-11 with criminal elements inside
[01:10:34.120 --> 01:10:39.160]  our government and others. People say well go all the way was more than that. The point
[01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:43.800]  is for a major presidential frontrunner this is devastating. He started it three months
[01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:50.000]  ago and I'm not going to toot my horn but let's just say repeatedly I have gotten info
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:54.640]  of Trump and then he's gone public with it. Stone was on months ago and said watch next
[01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:59.840]  week Trump's going to go public for auditing the private Federal Reserve and he said now
[01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:04.200]  to be clear I didn't tell him to he now knows it's the time and he's been mad about that
[01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:12.040]  for 40 years. I talked to Dr. Corsi he's known him 40 years. He says Trump is a sleeper patriot
[01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:15.840]  not a sleeper cell but like a sleeper patriot and that's why they're so scared of him and
[01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:22.680]  now in a new AOL poll and others. Nearly half of Sandra supporters say they might switch
[01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:27.040]  to Trump just over the fact that he's being robbed when he's clearly the frontrunner
[01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:34.040]  as well. So the gloves are off the system is showing itself be very naked. Ted Cruz is
[01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:39.680]  trying to spin all this here's the Daily Mail. Cruz claims he's won landslides as a quote
[01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:44.240]  over and over beating Trump in five consecutive states even though only one of them held an
[01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:50.720]  election. He's walking a tightrope on Glenn Beck and Fox News. He goes on there and never
[01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:58.040]  says he goes the voters have spoken and Trump is a sore loser and then never says the party
[01:11:58.040 --> 01:12:03.480]  cancelled the election or he won Louisiana he won Georgia he won Arizona he won Tennessee
[01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:09.120]  he won these other states and then they just take the delegates and give them to Cruz.
[01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:13.120]  He just goes I'm winning I've got the bushes behind me he's talking more and more like Herbert
[01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:19.400]  Walker Bush he says as his mentor. Revealed Colorado lawmakers who voted the scrap election
[01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:25.520]  are Ted Cruz delegates Breitbart well that's not really surprising. Exclusive Trump campaign
[01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:32.040]  Cruz staged attack in Georgia to steal delegates not grassroots activism. RNC chief no changes
[01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:39.760]  to delegate requirement likely they're gonna go ahead with the steal. It is simply amazing
[01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:43.240]  to see all this happen and I want to cover the waterfront with him he's with us till
[01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:50.200]  about 40 after then we have Richard Reeves from New York on the eve of the primaries
[01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:56.200]  that start tomorrow looks like Trump's gonna get 99 or more delegates but if you add all
[01:12:56.200 --> 01:13:07.080]  the math up he's gonna be at like 116 120 they're saying but if you added up if Cruz
[01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:11.200]  had stolen more than 70 80 delegates Trump would be way ahead of he wins these other
[01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:15.920]  states at the projections he's got so this is really unprecedented again I got big issues
[01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:20.320]  with some of the things Trump does is yeah you know Al Qaeda is not human so let's torture
[01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:24.840]  him or whatever we just become them or ISIS or you know let the FBI into the iPhone he's
[01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:29.320]  not tech savvy I told you the FBI was in that thing you know beforehand of course they admit
[01:13:29.320 --> 01:13:35.200]  that now but he's he's a nationalist he doesn't want us to be screwed over he just wants fair
[01:13:35.200 --> 01:13:39.120]  deals and they hate him they've got the MO on him and I'm here to tell you I've talked
[01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:43.120]  to people before he ran but said he ever talked about Trump I'm like no they're like boy he
[01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:46.760]  sure is against the new world order and these people that know him well I'm gonna stop right
[01:13:46.760 --> 01:13:52.080]  there and I'm like really Donald Trump that guy like a liberal because I knew he was on
[01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:57.560]  the East Coast tried to work with people and like no man so so for whatever reason they're
[01:13:57.560 --> 01:14:01.480]  scared of him and I want to ask Wayne Madsen formerly high level with the National Security
[01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:06.760]  Agency bestselling author journalist covering for decades what's happening on Capitol Hill
[01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:09.920]  doesn't really need any introduction here but I want to ask him why he thinks they're
[01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:14.600]  so scared of Trump what he thinks they may do and then of course that ties into the
[01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:20.560]  devastating victory for humanity and all the listeners the viewers Wayne Madsen is one
[01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:25.960]  of the only other people who within days of 9-11 happening came out and said this thing
[01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:30.240]  absolutely stinks to high heaven you know during the break let's just replace my earpiece
[01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:34.080]  whatever's going on we readjusted four times I just want to get a new one thanks just keeps
[01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:42.480]  falling out for whatever reason though we readjusted drive me crazy Wayne Madsen was
[01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:47.160]  one of the only people who would come out and say look we have false flags we have inside
[01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:54.200]  jobs criminal elements working with Saudi Arabia and others clearly order to stand down normal
[01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:59.120]  procedures were not there 15 of the 19 come from there we had all these FBI whistleblowers
[01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:02.920]  and the embassy head whistleblowers saying they were ordered to let them in and we told
[01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:08.040]  you Saudi Arabia helped run the attack they at least helped create the patsies there was
[01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:12.840]  a stand down and then they tried to radically fundamentally change American liberty to take
[01:15:12.840 --> 01:15:18.480]  our freedoms launched all these wars attack the wrong country Iraq and now we're backing
[01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:26.320]  ISIS and Al Qaeda who Saudi Arabia runs and Saudi Arabia is threatening to pull $750 billion
[01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:30.520]  out of the United States to quote bankrupt us that's the definition of terrorism threatening
[01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:38.680]  physical or economic harm for a political or economic reason and you can pull up as
[01:15:38.680 --> 01:15:44.080]  different definitions but it's basically threatening violence or economic harm unless your political
[01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:52.280]  or economic demands aren't met and they're holding a hostage think about how this is
[01:15:52.280 --> 01:15:59.360]  now one of the number one stories here in the United States and I guess this is the
[01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:06.480]  season of things here on the show can you guys come in and turn the Mac many off it's
[01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:12.000]  blaring protest stuff in here thanks we have a really big complex studio and we've been
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:16.360]  adding a lot of equipment and a lot of things and it's playing a video behind Wayne Madsen
[01:16:16.360 --> 01:16:21.480]  right now so we will get that shut down thank you very much and again Wayne Madsen with
[01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:29.000]  us now to about 45 after want to give him plenty of time and then we will be able to
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:33.160]  basically oh I could hit it right here on my butt I've got too much equipment here but
[01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:39.880]  but seriously this is a really really big time right now because the fact that the golden
[01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:44.160]  silver marketer rigged that's now mainstream news the fact that the currency rates are
[01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:48.680]  rigged that's now out the fact that interest rates are rigged that's now public everything's
[01:16:48.680 --> 01:16:55.800]  coming out and the establishment though is just moving forward so I want to ask Wayne
[01:16:55.800 --> 01:16:59.720]  where he sees all of this going but Wayne do you agree with me that this is this is
[01:16:59.720 --> 01:17:05.200]  cause for celebration and that Donald Trump kind of at the coup de gras at the end of
[01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:09.840]  the road help push this over the edge the fact that Saudi Arabian involvement in our
[01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:15.800]  governments bare minimum stand down we know there's more there but if this all comes out
[01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:19.480]  congressmen that have seen it Democrat and Republican tell me it'll bring down the bushes
[01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:24.000]  and the Clintons and the quote made them cry we know what's in those pages where do you
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:30.040]  see all this going Wayne Madsen well for years you know myself and several other people have
[01:17:30.040 --> 01:17:37.720]  been calling for the 28 pages from that the congressional intelligence report on the failures
[01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:46.280]  of 9 11 to be released I've spoken to former senator Robert Graham Bob Graham I've spoken
[01:17:46.280 --> 01:17:52.880]  to Walter Jones I've spoken to quite a few of the members of Congress who have called
[01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:59.800]  for that release and it's always been you know the immense Saudi lobby that has weighed
[01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:06.200]  in against any any release now the Obama administration has signaled it's willing to release it but
[01:18:06.200 --> 01:18:12.160]  my question is what is it going to look like it will the release of the 28 pages well the
[01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:19.120]  only thing that's not blacked out be the page numbers as is often the case with you know
[01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:25.480]  major intelligence reports I would also note that in the last week we finally seen most
[01:18:25.480 --> 01:18:31.400]  of the national intelligence estimate on Saddam Hussein and weapons of mass destruction that's
[01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:37.600]  been released the CIA report and it says it's right there it says there there was nothing
[01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:44.200]  to link Saddam Hussein with either 9 11 or WMD's and a lot of people I know in the intelligence
[01:18:44.200 --> 01:18:51.360]  community who are my sources and who suffered greatly because of what they said they said
[01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:55.800]  the same thing they said what was in that report and they contributed to that report
[01:18:55.800 --> 01:19:03.360]  saying there was no connection between Saddam and WMD's or Al Qaeda and yet they many of
[01:19:03.360 --> 01:19:11.320]  them were lost many of them lost their jobs and one case a young analyst at NSA named
[01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:18.120]  Ken Ford Jr. he said look there's no evidence I've been looking at the intercepts of Iraqi
[01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:24.960]  communication there's no evidence of any connection between Saddam Hussein and WMD's
[01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:33.800]  and yet you know he was basically targeted in an FBI NSA securities thing operation
[01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:38.880]  basically what I heard that Dick Cheney said we're gonna make an example of some of these
[01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:45.360]  naysayers and and Ken Ford unfortunately it was one of the people targeted by the real
[01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:51.600]  criminal Dick Cheney and his you know his boss who one could argue whether Bush knew
[01:19:51.600 --> 01:19:56.420]  really what was going on at the time he was drunk now now Wayne Madsen you have amazing
[01:19:56.420 --> 01:20:03.760]  sources some of them public like Sibel Edmonds FBI translator but today we're really releasing
[01:20:03.760 --> 01:20:09.720]  new info from the 9-11 congressional report the 28 pages because I've interviewed Jones
[01:20:09.720 --> 01:20:14.360]  and other members of Congress so have you you've talked to a lot of the sources who
[01:20:14.360 --> 01:20:23.560]  got in trouble under the persecution of whistleblowers and so now we know what they said 13, 14, 15
[01:20:23.560 --> 01:20:28.160]  years ago depending on which whistleblower has now been vetted and proven to be true
[01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:34.760]  so these were valiant people that wouldn't fix intelligence and wouldn't frame Iraq after
[01:20:34.760 --> 01:20:41.760]  the fact at the FBI at the CIA at the Pentagon and other areas so let's spend the next ten
[01:20:41.760 --> 01:20:45.480]  minutes before we go to break because you're a top expert on this fleshing out what's really
[01:20:45.480 --> 01:20:50.080]  in the 28 pages and what the whistleblowers told us about it because they're the unsung
[01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:55.520]  heroes now this is coming out I'm glad you reminded me that major persecution happened
[01:20:55.520 --> 01:21:02.200]  to the people that testified to Congress and others who didn't go along with the big lie
[01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:06.760]  right well like when you look back at these individual I gotta say they came from almost
[01:21:06.760 --> 01:21:11.840]  every agency imaginable including some that you know people haven't heard of like the
[01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:18.080]  national geospatial intelligence agency was what one of the places where people military
[01:21:18.080 --> 01:21:25.600]  officers at the Pentagon people at norad like the FAA you name it treasury department that
[01:21:25.600 --> 01:21:32.160]  were monitoring the money flows they all they all suffered and you know including a secretary
[01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:38.160]  of the treasury Paul O'Neill who was basically run out of Washington because of what he found
[01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:44.840]  out about Sally financing of the 9-11 don't forget John O'Neill deputy FBI director quit
[01:21:44.840 --> 01:21:50.440]  months before went to be the head of security his first day on the job was 9-11 at the towers
[01:21:50.440 --> 01:21:54.840]  hired by the security firm of Marvin Bush they sure killed two birds with one stone yeah
[01:21:54.840 --> 01:22:00.600]  John yeah it's right John O'Neill I actually I never met John O'Neill but I I know where
[01:22:00.600 --> 01:22:08.280]  he used to go and drink in DC and the bartender who used to serve him told me how John O'Neill
[01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:12.480]  used to say look they're covering up for the Saudis like we've got them and there's going
[01:22:12.480 --> 01:22:16.080]  to be something really terrible is going to happen of course well he was in the London
[01:22:16.080 --> 01:22:20.400]  independent of a few months before 9-11 he gave a speech saying we're covering up for
[01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:24.720]  the Saudis there's gonna be a giant terror attack I'm trying to stop it he left the FBI
[01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:33.840]  to try to stop it right so so what's in the report from what I gather it's going to basically
[01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:39.840]  it names Prince Bondar remember Bondar Bush he was so close to the Bush family he got that
[01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:44.640]  nickname Bondar Bush he was a Saudi ambassador to the United States he was the dean of the
[01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:50.240]  diplomatic corps he'd been here longer than any other ambassador so he's named his wife
[01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:55.520]  was involved in transferring money to some of the actual hijackers who are then in San
[01:22:55.520 --> 01:23:01.440]  Diego let's be clear the Saudi ambassador to the U.S. his wife wiring money to the hijackers
[01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:08.840]  that is sensational yes and it doesn't stop with Saudi Arabia I've been told that the
[01:23:08.840 --> 01:23:15.360]  real gems in that in those 28 pages are what is what are contained in the footnoted material
[01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:20.320]  I don't know if the footnotes are at the bottom of the page or they're you know back towards
[01:23:20.320 --> 01:23:26.640]  the end somewhere but the footnoted material you if you look at that it's like peeling
[01:23:26.640 --> 01:23:32.840]  back and onion layer by layer you're going to get to some other countries in addition
[01:23:32.840 --> 01:23:40.400]  to Saudi Arabia that are implicated now again people get confused between the congressional
[01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:44.480]  report and the 9-11 Commission report but right the mainstream media is trying to use
[01:23:44.480 --> 01:23:49.600]  quotes out of the 9-11 Commission report to confuse people and to say that Saudi Arabia
[01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:54.240]  you know clear evidence wasn't shown but even members of the 9-11 Commission say there was
[01:23:54.240 --> 01:24:00.840]  a cover-up and Saudi Arabia was involved yes even even the 9-11 Commission and that's a
[01:24:00.840 --> 01:24:05.320]  governor came Tom Kane of New Jersey and Lee Hamilton who used to be the chairman of the
[01:24:05.320 --> 01:24:12.640]  House Intelligence Committee both came out and said that they were lied to so the 9-11
[01:24:12.640 --> 01:24:17.560]  Commission report you might as well throw that in a trash can now the one we're talking
[01:24:17.560 --> 01:24:25.640]  about with the 28 pages was the Joint Congressional Report done by the Intelligence Committees
[01:24:25.640 --> 01:24:31.480]  on the failures of 9-11 why did it happen they looked at it more closely than the 9-11
[01:24:31.480 --> 01:24:36.560]  Commission because what the 9-11 Commission did is they generated a report that was already
[01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:41.600]  written which was basically a wish list of everything the Justice Department the FBI
[01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:47.800]  and as they wanted to have in it in a perfect world where the U.S. has suffered a perfect
[01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:51.840]  world for them where the U.S. has suffered a catastrophic terrorist attack so that's
[01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:57.520]  what the 9-11 Commission did is a rubber stamp something that was already written that's
[01:24:57.520 --> 01:25:04.040]  right and expanding on this we see the perfect storm Saudi Arabia wants to take out Iraq
[01:25:04.040 --> 01:25:08.840]  because then they can start going after Iran and Syria that's all admitted the globalist
[01:25:08.840 --> 01:25:13.560]  want to be able to have all their weapons sales take domestic liberties away here in
[01:25:13.560 --> 01:25:17.720]  the United States but the whole world used it to basically trample on freedoms and then
[01:25:17.720 --> 01:25:22.160]  now they think we're so ignorant round two they're funding ISIS they're funding al-Qaeda
[01:25:22.160 --> 01:25:26.080]  it's now gone from a few thousand al-Qaeda to hundreds of thousands in ISIS very same
[01:25:26.080 --> 01:25:30.680]  Saudi flag they fly it's just black not green and our media tries to cover up the link
[01:25:30.680 --> 01:25:36.080]  between Saudi Arabia and ISIS and al-Qaeda today when the West and Obama and NATO are
[01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:40.960]  working with Saudi Arabia and their proxy armies with Turkey and others Israel's involved
[01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:47.360]  to to try to overthrow these countries that's right and and the Saudi ambassador who replaced
[01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:53.080]  Bondar this guy to bear is now the Saudi foreign minister he's basically in charge of this
[01:25:53.080 --> 01:26:01.480]  huge lobbying effort in Washington now to suppress the 28 pages to basically twist the
[01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:07.760]  arms of members of Congress and also now the Saudis are threatening to divest and sell
[01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:14.400]  off billions of dollars 750 billion isn't that going to cause a Streisand effect well
[01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:20.560]  may you know what we have it now is Barack Obama going to Saudi Arabia what's he you
[01:26:20.560 --> 01:26:24.560]  know what's he going over there to a power and we've got emergency meetings with him
[01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:28.080]  and the head of the Federal Reserve in secret and the Treasury had that aren't supposed
[01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:34.000]  to happen under federal law right and we know that his CIA director John Brennan if he's
[01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:39.840]  not a Wahhabist it former he was also former station chief of the CIA and Riyadh Saudi
[01:26:39.840 --> 01:26:46.880]  Arabia if he's not a Wahhabist he certainly has shown that he's very much pro Wahhabist
[01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:50.360]  in his policies certainly on their payroll so let's talk about that I've talked to a
[01:26:50.360 --> 01:26:53.800]  lot of their high-level people and they say Brennan who lived there over 20 years did
[01:26:53.800 --> 01:26:58.920]  convert to radical Islam and that would show could this actually be a total double cross
[01:26:58.920 --> 01:27:02.920]  where they're not just going to use radical Islam to attack us in a type of giant Tet
[01:27:02.920 --> 01:27:07.000]  offensive down the road with sleeper cells but they actually may be deciding to totally
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:12.360]  double cross the West and bring it down well we've seen a little bit of that with the the
[01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:20.040]  Turks you know their government is basically Islamist it's cozy with Saudi Arabia and you
[01:27:20.040 --> 01:27:25.440]  know letting all these refugees flood into Europe and what what happens you know we've
[01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:33.680]  got this you know it's been called a weapon of mass migration and we got Soros and and
[01:27:33.680 --> 01:27:39.120]  the head of the OECD saying oh yeah well this has to happen these people need to replace
[01:27:39.120 --> 01:27:45.040]  the people who are retiring in the workforce in Europe so there's more to it than just
[01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:50.960]  accepting refugees there's people meeting behind the scenes that are looking at a new
[01:27:50.960 --> 01:28:01.000]  labor pool for Europe but this labor pool of of of young men who are jihadists they're
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:07.400]  not the kind of people you want taking jobs in in Europe because well they're gonna effectively
[01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:12.240]  change what we know as Western civilization I know this I went to high school and college
[01:28:12.240 --> 01:28:16.720]  was a lot of really nice Muslim people from Iraq Jordan you name it Lebanese awesome people
[01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:21.680]  other be Christian or Muslim but let me tell you I mean stereotype people from Saudi Arabia
[01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:26.600]  whether they be rich or not are super arrogant chip on the shoulder very hateful and they
[01:28:26.600 --> 01:28:31.760]  just feel super entitled and just walk around treating everybody like crap and I just why
[01:28:31.760 --> 01:28:37.120]  on earth we want to bring millions of these people in here military age men when so many
[01:28:37.120 --> 01:28:41.000]  of them admit they're going to attack us I mean it's just and then and then in Europe
[01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:45.120]  if you criticize them they arrest you I'm sure you've heard if you criticize the Turkish
[01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:51.120]  president Merkel will now have you arrested in Germany right right I mean that's that's
[01:28:51.120 --> 01:28:56.120]  what's going on and I do know from being you know talking to people and being in the Middle
[01:28:56.120 --> 01:29:01.880]  East the countries that surround Saudi Arabia hate that country they don't like the Saudi
[01:29:01.880 --> 01:29:06.720]  kingdom and I'm talking about not just Iran where there's a religious difference and
[01:29:06.720 --> 01:29:11.920]  the she is by the way the she is when you compare them to the Wahhabists the she is
[01:29:11.920 --> 01:29:20.120]  are like Unitarians or Quakers I mean in comparison but the Iraqis the Jordanians the Yemenis
[01:29:20.120 --> 01:29:28.000]  the Omanis the Bahrainis the Emirates the Kuwaitis have no time for the Saudis for
[01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:32.120]  those that don't know these Saudis were white slavers that doesn't mean they only kidnapped
[01:29:32.120 --> 01:29:37.080]  white people sex slavers they also robbed caravans that's who they are they are they're
[01:29:37.080 --> 01:29:41.480]  desert bandits I mean man you wonder why they took Islam and turned it into you know keep
[01:29:41.480 --> 01:29:46.240]  women and slave pits that's why the feminist groups love them it's a form of cuddling
[01:29:46.240 --> 01:29:51.160]  glorious time and people just can't get enough of it we're on the march the empires on the
[01:29:51.160 --> 01:30:01.360]  run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network today is Monday April 18th and here's some of the
[01:30:01.360 --> 01:30:05.160]  latest news it's now known that the Colorado lawmakers who voted to scrap the state primary
[01:30:05.160 --> 01:30:08.560]  and in fact had Cruz delegates four state Republicans voted against the bill that would
[01:30:08.560 --> 01:30:12.200]  allow Colorado voters a chance to vote in a presidential primary and all of them are
[01:30:12.200 --> 01:30:15.760]  crew supporters with three of them listed as members of Cruz's Colorado leadership
[01:30:15.760 --> 01:30:20.360]  team and one of them senator Kevin Grantham even had the audacity brag about Cruz's quote
[01:30:20.360 --> 01:30:24.000]  victory on Twitter despite the fact that the voters did not get to pick a candidate in
[01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:28.920]  other news only 6% of people trust the mainstream media putting the industry about equal to Congress
[01:30:28.920 --> 01:30:32.720]  and well below the public's view of other organizations this lack of confidence in
[01:30:32.720 --> 01:30:36.920]  establishment media is fueled by an accurate season reporting and deceptive bias another
[01:30:36.920 --> 01:30:41.600]  study revealed that only 45% of Americans over 77 million will not pay an income tax
[01:30:41.600 --> 01:30:45.240]  this year because they have no taxable income or they receive enough tax breaks or raise
[01:30:45.240 --> 01:30:49.240]  their liability this says a lot about the current decline of the economy you'd expect
[01:30:49.240 --> 01:30:53.920]  less tax revenue as more Americans leave the job market or stay underemployed at part time

[01:34:25.720 --> 01:34:29.920]  but I wanted to ask Wayne madson what he wants to cover for us so we go ahead and get him
[01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:38.000]  in place as well to cover both of those conventions with our crews as well so Wayne madson part
[01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:43.800]  of the team and you notice that team is expanding because the globalist are engaging in so many
[01:34:43.800 --> 01:34:47.680]  crimes openly and as people realize that we know what we're talking about we get more
[01:34:47.680 --> 01:34:55.080]  and more support but with that comes a lot of expenses and that's why it's so important
[01:34:55.080 --> 01:35:00.000]  to remember if you're buying water filters or want non GMO heirloom seeds or want a mow

[01:37:30.600 --> 01:37:35.520]  cost thirty thousand dollars for us to run a batch just for the bio PQQ was it fourteen
[01:37:35.520 --> 01:37:40.000]  thousand dollars a kilo it takes more than two kilos in each batch that's why this is
[01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:44.440]  such a game changer that's why it's somewhat expensive a similar stuff out there that you

[01:38:10.920 --> 01:38:15.520]  three nine now going back to Wayne Madsen and a little bit of time we have left with
[01:38:15.520 --> 01:38:21.240]  Wayne Wayne you've heard me throw out a lot of points here the election theft why are
[01:38:21.240 --> 01:38:25.520]  they so scared of Trump what's other big news you're working on I know you've broken some
[01:38:25.520 --> 01:38:31.200]  big stories as well that are at Wayne Madsen report.com and infowars.com Carl Rove backing
[01:38:31.200 --> 01:38:38.560]  Cruz and Clinton at the same time also you asked was Cruz's father linked the JFK assassination
[01:38:38.560 --> 01:38:43.640]  Cuban hired by Lee Harvey Oswald bears a striking resemblance but we know he was tied into these
[01:38:43.640 --> 01:38:50.800]  very groups so we can and the bushes were running on operation we know he later Cruz himself
[01:38:50.800 --> 01:38:55.040]  came to work for the bushes so let's let's cover those issues right now Wayne.
[01:38:55.040 --> 01:39:02.520]  Well yeah the one I'm currently working on is the Raphael Cruz now there's actually there's
[01:39:02.520 --> 01:39:09.200]  like three Raphael cruises this gets really complicated but when I'm looking at the background
[01:39:09.200 --> 01:39:15.560]  of the Cruz family I think we got another Obama we've got CIA people on both sides mom and
[01:39:15.560 --> 01:39:24.240]  dad and the photograph the the one with Lee Harvey Oswald pamphleteering in front of the
[01:39:24.240 --> 01:39:29.640]  international trademark New Orleans by the way which was owned by Clay Shaw who was the
[01:39:29.640 --> 01:39:36.520]  main target of Jim Garrison's investigation we have the only guy not identified in that
[01:39:36.520 --> 01:39:45.360]  photograph is the guy that looks a lot like Raphael Cruz I've got the FBI report from November
[01:39:45.360 --> 01:39:52.840]  1963 they were not able to identify that individual the House Select Committee on Assassinations
[01:39:52.840 --> 01:40:01.440]  of 1978 Robert Blakey the general counsel recently reaffirmed after he appeared on a
[01:40:01.440 --> 01:40:07.240]  front line he said we don't know who that guy is we never determine who that guy is well
[01:40:07.240 --> 01:40:12.440]  even if you're not going to use the photo as evidence of Raphael's ties to the people
[01:40:12.440 --> 01:40:17.640]  in New Orleans that were being looked at by Jim Garrison let's look at his company he
[01:40:17.640 --> 01:40:26.760]  worked for he said he was a geophysical computer guy for this company that was owned by a French
[01:40:26.760 --> 01:40:34.200]  oil services company Schlumberger the heir to the Schlumberger company Jean de Manille
[01:40:34.200 --> 01:40:39.560]  winds up as a member of the board of directors of Permindex out of New Orleans which was
[01:40:39.560 --> 01:40:46.960]  a CIA front company run by who Clay Shaw the photograph of the Raphael Cruz lookalike
[01:40:46.960 --> 01:40:53.280]  is taken where in front of the international trademark owned by Clay Shaw so even if you
[01:40:53.280 --> 01:40:58.040]  don't use the photograph as evidence you got to look at the business ties as evidence
[01:40:58.040 --> 01:41:05.840]  and here's the scariest thing Ted Cruz has just hired a company called strategic communications
[01:41:05.840 --> 01:41:14.920]  laboratories out of London where his mom lived for from 1960 to 1966 married to a guy over
[01:41:14.920 --> 01:41:19.920]  there who we don't know what he did for a living but this company specializes in mass
[01:41:19.920 --> 01:41:26.400]  deception psychological warfare influence influence operations and behavioral modification
[01:41:26.400 --> 01:41:32.560]  that's us subsidiary Cambridge analytics has been retained by the Cruz for president campaign
[01:41:32.560 --> 01:41:39.680]  as an advisor now after I I broke the story about New Orleans and and the possibility
[01:41:39.680 --> 01:41:46.640]  that's Raphael Cruz their pamphleting with Lee Hardy Oswald I've been attacked and it's
[01:41:46.640 --> 01:41:52.600]  always the same characters one of the attacking sites is one cat they were the same site nine
[01:41:52.600 --> 01:41:59.640]  years ago that attacked me for reporting that Dennis Haster was involved in molesting members
[01:41:59.640 --> 01:42:04.320]  underage members of his high school wrestling team in Yorkville Illinois they by the way
[01:42:04.320 --> 01:42:08.640]  you've now been you've now been proven right you're the first person I ever heard say that
[01:42:08.640 --> 01:42:13.520]  Haster this is like over a decade ago you said he was a perv pedophile that you were
[01:42:13.520 --> 01:42:19.560]  investigating that and so where's your Pulitzer prize there buddy I don't I don't need those
[01:42:19.560 --> 01:42:24.160]  prizes I've been to these ceremonies where these people award each other prizes it's
[01:42:24.160 --> 01:42:30.400]  really disgusting because I agree you don't want a Nobel Prize or Pulitzer no no I mean
[01:42:30.400 --> 01:42:36.400]  that you're basically to get one of those you're submitting to some control so if you
[01:42:36.400 --> 01:42:41.720]  get one if I ever got anything like that I say I messed up how did I how I get one of
[01:42:41.720 --> 01:42:46.040]  these I I shouldn't be getting one of these because you know people to get those are part
[01:42:46.040 --> 01:42:54.920]  of the system but the story on Rafael Cruz and the grandparents his name was look Ted
[01:42:54.920 --> 01:43:01.440]  Cruz's father was Rafael bienvenidos Cruz his father was Rafael bienvenidos Cruz now try
[01:43:01.440 --> 01:43:07.120]  to try to look up records on people with the same last name but the grandparents came from
[01:43:07.120 --> 01:43:15.400]  Cuba in 1966 Rafael came in 57 he said he came to escape Castro Castro's Cuba 57 Castro
[01:43:15.400 --> 01:43:20.840]  wasn't in power for another three years so he lied about that his father worked for RCA
[01:43:20.840 --> 01:43:27.480]  in Cuba at a time when RCA was involved in a lot of anti-communist activities including
[01:43:27.480 --> 01:43:33.800]  setting up plain desk and radio stations for the CIA so you know what do we know about
[01:43:33.800 --> 01:43:40.240]  the Cruz family right now we know about as much as we know about Obama's family in 2008
[01:43:40.240 --> 01:43:47.480]  and Manicopa I didn't look at Obama's family back then and I found out soon enough weeks
[01:43:47.480 --> 01:43:53.400]  after his inauguration how he was linked to the CIA and it turns out the whole the whole
[01:43:53.400 --> 01:44:01.200]  family I tell you Cruz's dad does have a interesting looking features that are somewhat unique
[01:44:01.200 --> 01:44:05.160]  and it does look like a spinning image of his dad but then you add it in together with
[01:44:05.160 --> 01:44:10.160]  the whole Cuban community how he's one of the early communities how he's hooked into
[01:44:10.160 --> 01:44:14.680]  all these different skunk works type organizations and then how his son goes right up at the
[01:44:14.680 --> 01:44:19.320]  top with the bushes who we know were running the operation to kill Kennedy George Herbert
[01:44:19.320 --> 01:44:24.320]  Walker Bush senior who's come out and declassified documents to have been in the CIA in the early
[01:44:24.320 --> 01:44:28.880]  60s he lied about it when he became the director in the 70s just magically the director but
[01:44:28.880 --> 01:44:33.640]  never been in it yeah and one of the guys in that photograph in front of the trademark
[01:44:33.640 --> 01:44:39.560]  at the far right is Chauncey Holt who was the accountant for Meyer Lansky the mobster
[01:44:39.560 --> 01:44:47.600]  and Chauncey Chauncey Holt apparently told author Ed Haslam who wrote a book about all
[01:44:47.600 --> 01:44:54.560]  this in New Orleans in those years that all the Cubans in that photograph were part of
[01:44:54.560 --> 01:45:00.640]  the CIA's operation Mongoose that was the clandestine program to overthrow Fidel Castro
[01:45:00.640 --> 01:45:06.960]  and Oswald was there doing all this just to you know sheep dip these people as part of
[01:45:06.960 --> 01:45:12.960]  an anti a pro Castro movement sure it's a cover absolutely this is to get our legend
[01:45:12.960 --> 01:45:17.320]  going let's shift gears out of this what do you make of Trump with the communist Chinese
[01:45:17.320 --> 01:45:21.840]  government now coming out saying you know we're gonna have a trade war with you you're
[01:45:21.840 --> 01:45:25.040]  not gonna be a superpower if you go for Trump Trump saying hey you're involved in economic
[01:45:25.040 --> 01:45:29.200]  warfare what do you make of the Saudis getting so mad of him what are you thinking about
[01:45:29.200 --> 01:45:36.360]  Trump these days well I mean I think he's absolutely right to be upset about the theft
[01:45:36.360 --> 01:45:42.640]  of delegates by Ted Cruz I ran across this and when I covered the 2000 campaign in a
[01:45:42.640 --> 01:45:50.760]  Republican convention that year was in Philadelphia and remember McCain was running against Bush
[01:45:50.760 --> 01:45:57.120]  for that nomination and McCain won the state of Michigan which was a winner take all state
[01:45:57.120 --> 01:46:02.040]  so here I see Michigan governor John Engler on the street and I said governor can I have
[01:46:02.040 --> 01:46:08.680]  a word with you and I said how come you're here representing Michigan when Michigan was
[01:46:08.680 --> 01:46:14.320]  in a you know winner take all McCain wanted you're the co-chair of the Bush for president
[01:46:14.320 --> 01:46:19.600]  campaign in Michigan he says oh we just couldn't allow anybody coming off the street to say
[01:46:19.600 --> 01:46:24.800]  they were a McCain delegate we had to vet them and then that process McCain lost a lot
[01:46:24.800 --> 01:46:31.120]  of his delegates in winner take all Michigan look for the same thing to happen in Florida
[01:46:31.120 --> 01:46:38.400]  where Trump won every county except for Rubio's Miami Dade a winner take all we'll see they've
[01:46:38.400 --> 01:46:41.400]  already done that they're already taking Georgia they're already taking Tennessee they're already
[01:46:41.400 --> 01:46:45.720]  taking Arizona all these states where he wins they just take it and then Cruz gets up there
[01:46:45.720 --> 01:46:51.760]  and says I've won a grassroots uprising the voters have spoken talk about a Psyop and
[01:46:51.760 --> 01:46:56.880]  he never says it was voterless and then they criticize myself and drudge and others because
[01:46:56.880 --> 01:47:01.320]  we dare to point out they're now going voterless like never before is this a sign of desperation
[01:47:01.320 --> 01:47:06.280]  or arrogance Wayne well look you look at the people who have glommed on to the Cruz campaign
[01:47:06.280 --> 01:47:11.240]  you got the Neil Bush acting as an advisor to him he's a crook from the Silverado saving
[01:47:11.240 --> 01:47:17.160]  a loan collapse we got Jeb endorsing him and then and then we have David Dewhurst the
[01:47:17.160 --> 01:47:23.120]  former lieutenant governor of Texas who ran against Cruz for the Senate nomination lost
[01:47:23.120 --> 01:47:28.160]  in the primary and all of a sudden he comes out and endorses a guy who he absolutely had
[01:47:28.160 --> 01:47:34.160]  no time for Ted Cruz why well who did you know what agency did David Dewhurst use CIA
[01:47:34.160 --> 01:47:39.400]  and by the way he wasn't just some analyst he was down in Central and South America with
[01:47:39.400 --> 01:47:46.240]  Klaus Barbie yes and and you know what this is all this is all home week with the Cruz
[01:47:46.240 --> 01:47:52.520]  campaign they're all coming together David Dewhurst and the Bushes and and and and and
[01:47:52.520 --> 01:47:56.900]  we're you know we're to believe that Rafael Cruz who lived in Dallas and then moved to
[01:47:56.900 --> 01:48:01.440]  New Orleans in the early 60s and now this crew of narcotics trafficking rogue government
[01:48:01.440 --> 01:48:06.480]  CIA people are telling us we don't get to vote in America anymore and they have the
[01:48:06.480 --> 01:48:11.320]  Chinese Communist calling Trump Hitler when they've killed 84 million people yeah I would
[01:48:11.320 --> 01:48:16.760]  note that Ted Cruz's dad decides to leave New Orleans in 67 to move to Calgary that's
[01:48:16.760 --> 01:48:23.880]  the same year Jim Garrison began his investigation of exactly who was with Oswald in 1963 you
[01:48:23.880 --> 01:48:31.040]  know gee Rafael you sure got out of the country fast and amazing amazing Wayne let's talk
[01:48:31.040 --> 01:48:35.640]  call me this afternoon or just tell me send an email to do the news director I know we're
[01:48:35.640 --> 01:48:39.240]  getting everything coordinated what you think we ought to target what you want to do in
[01:48:39.240 --> 01:48:45.400]  Cleveland but but also there when the Democrats meet later and what in Philly so let's get
[01:48:45.400 --> 01:48:51.560]  this going absolutely I think you're right though that in both Philly and Cleveland we're
[01:48:51.560 --> 01:48:58.200]  going to see a lot of protesters Sanders protesters out in the streets in Philly and Trump people
[01:48:58.200 --> 01:49:03.920]  out in the streets in Cleveland if if more of the chicanery is by the way Trump's come
[01:49:03.920 --> 01:49:06.960]  out and said I don't want violence you're a lot of mad people if you still the election
[01:49:06.960 --> 01:49:10.600]  in Cleveland I'm concerned when he's at a police union in New York I saw the clip on
[01:49:10.600 --> 01:49:14.400]  Fox this morning and they act like he was calling for violence no he wasn't it's the
[01:49:14.400 --> 01:49:19.080]  Soros Democratic Party Black Lives Matter crews that are openly running around calling
[01:49:19.080 --> 01:49:24.080]  for violence and our crews have been all over the country documenting it right and remember
[01:49:24.080 --> 01:49:29.720]  who is his major opponent Cruz has working for him a company that's tied to the CIA that
[01:49:29.720 --> 01:49:35.440]  specializes in mass deception psychological warfare influence operations and behavioral
[01:49:35.440 --> 01:49:41.280]  modification and we know through history the CIA has used the media to accomplish and what

[01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:37.760]  I was just a baby my mama told me son always be a good boy don't ever play with God but
[01:54:37.760 --> 01:54:43.640]  I shot a man and Reno just Richard wouldn't tell us his location he's got something to
[01:54:43.640 --> 01:54:47.440]  surprise us on air we're gonna go to Richard Reeves my good buddy and info wars political
[01:54:47.440 --> 01:54:50.960]  correspondent joining us I would guess from New York probably trump tower I'm not sure
[01:54:50.960 --> 01:54:58.000]  we're about to find out but before we go any further I cannot express to you that huge exciting
[01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:02.720]  things are happening good bad and ugly when I say we're starting to turn the tide against
[01:55:02.720 --> 01:55:06.800]  tyranny and that evil is in trouble I'm not saying that as a cheerleader I'm saying it
[01:55:06.800 --> 01:55:13.840]  because it's true and it's a big deal that Saudi Arabia's role in 911 is coming out there's
[01:55:13.840 --> 01:55:20.080]  a lot of whistleblowers lost their jobs got in trouble and got killed so we know the truth
[01:55:20.080 --> 01:55:26.920]  the globalist are in trouble people the Pentagon said no to backing al-qaeda in Syria so they
[01:55:26.920 --> 01:55:31.320]  changed the name to ISIS I mean so many good people in government not a government are
[01:55:31.320 --> 01:55:36.080]  saying no the new world orders have in trouble and now they want to tell us trump is Hitler
[01:55:36.080 --> 01:55:41.000]  the communist Chinese the biggest mass murderers in history because he because they got deals
[01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:46.120]  screwing us and they got a bunch of collaborators in our media and the left and the Republicans
[01:55:46.120 --> 01:55:53.480]  going along with foreign leaders that are mass murder connected lecturing us it's over
[01:55:53.480 --> 01:55:57.320]  so we win because of Trump running even if they cheat him they do it in front of everybody
[01:55:57.320 --> 01:56:01.200]  I know he's got a lot to talk about the 1015 minutes we've got with him Richard Reeves
[01:56:01.200 --> 01:56:06.480]  is in I'm guessing New York where are you Richard yes sir we do have a lot to talk about
[01:56:06.480 --> 01:56:11.120]  him before I reveal my surprise location I got to say that piece that you and Wayne
[01:56:11.120 --> 01:56:18.560]  Madsen just did that is completely best totally best of this audience anybody that calls themselves
[01:56:18.560 --> 01:56:23.120]  a journalist if they're not listening to the Alex Jones show on a daily basis then they're
[01:56:23.120 --> 01:56:27.280]  not a journalist they're missing out it's incredible what made Wayne Madsen did now
[01:56:27.280 --> 01:56:31.720]  I know this breaks protocol but I am actually here I'm on the way to shuffling off the buffalo
[01:56:31.720 --> 01:56:36.680]  here after this interview but I am actually in Cleveland at the Quicken Loans Arena right
[01:56:36.680 --> 01:56:40.320]  across the street right behind me I don't know if they had any idea when they paid the
[01:56:40.320 --> 01:56:44.280]  big bucks for that sponsorship if they knew they were going to be ground zero for what's
[01:56:44.280 --> 01:56:49.240]  coming up but they are so yeah we got a lot to talk about that Wayne Madsen piece just
[01:56:49.240 --> 01:56:53.680]  incredible yeah just bombshell after bombshell he was breaking down what's in the 28 pages
[01:56:53.680 --> 01:56:58.120]  because he's interviewed the people that put it together absolutely and speaking of 9-11
[01:56:58.120 --> 01:57:04.360]  the 28 pages there are people as of even today that oh you know us talking about 9-11 inside
[01:57:04.360 --> 01:57:10.720]  job the 28 pages etc hey take your tin foil hat off Alex take your tin foil hat off Richard
[01:57:10.720 --> 01:57:15.360]  Reeves take your tin foil hat off if a worse crew will get but they've all put on their
[01:57:15.360 --> 01:57:19.920]  tin foil hat they're joining in on I know what's it like when it's in the New York post
[01:57:19.920 --> 01:57:26.240]  that he's saying US government covered up Saudi role US government stood down on 9-11
[01:57:26.240 --> 01:57:30.240]  we're proving correct I got to tell you it feels good because it means the criminals
[01:57:30.240 --> 01:57:33.920]  are going to get brought to justice there's a better chance of that now this is so exciting
[01:57:33.920 --> 01:57:37.560]  Richard those arrogant bastards when they did this thought they'd get away with it well
[01:57:37.560 --> 01:57:43.040]  guess what you're not it's exciting and that's like okay if anybody thinks that Trump is
[01:57:43.040 --> 01:57:48.840]  not the right man president think of the influence Trump has had on so many things oh my gosh
[01:57:48.840 --> 01:57:55.640]  it's like gigantic wavos man got the Chinese threatening economic sanctions come on you

[02:00:13.200 --> 02:00:18.520]  national review has been totally discredited two months ago february 15th we'll show tv
[02:00:18.520 --> 02:00:24.360]  viewers a document cam shot it makes perfect sense that donald trump is a 9-11 truther
[02:00:24.360 --> 02:00:33.800]  february 15th 2016 and the article opens up in south carolina on saturday night donald
[02:00:33.800 --> 02:00:39.920]  trump turned into an alex jones show caller saying that saudi arabia was involved in
[02:00:39.920 --> 02:00:45.520]  9-11 and then a secret 28 pages showed it well i mean that was admitted then and known they
[02:00:45.520 --> 02:00:52.480]  just hope their readers were dumb and attacked yours truly but bernie sanders says he doesn't
[02:00:52.480 --> 02:00:58.520]  want to know it isn't going to talk about it isn't he a good little commie and hillary
[02:00:58.520 --> 02:01:02.880]  says she doesn't know anything about such a 28 pages richard i'm ranting but go ahead
[02:01:02.880 --> 02:01:06.040]  and finish up your points i know you're going to be on the nightly news tonight as well you're
[02:01:06.040 --> 02:01:11.160]  going to follow report for leon macadoo who's hosting but go ahead my friend absolutely
[02:01:11.160 --> 02:01:16.280]  well i'll tell you uh that piece of Wayne madson you talk about ted cruz one thing
[02:01:16.280 --> 02:01:21.360]  that i noticed back you know it didn't come up in y'all's interview but ted cruz ran
[02:01:21.360 --> 02:01:25.640]  against david dewhurst for that sentencing and david dewhurst was supposed to be the
[02:01:25.640 --> 02:01:30.640]  shoe in for that so this is all kind of started to really explain how ted cruz was able to
[02:01:30.640 --> 02:01:35.360]  really jump up there and be able to beat dewhurst and by the way there was a runoff for that
[02:01:35.360 --> 02:01:42.040]  race back in back in 2012 when ted cruz ran against dewhurst one thing that happened was
[02:01:42.040 --> 02:01:46.200]  is that i think i can't remember how many candidates there were in the primary but nobody
[02:01:46.200 --> 02:01:50.720]  got a majority in the primary so they had to have a runoff and i remember you know what
[02:01:50.720 --> 02:01:55.520]  i want to hear ted cruz victory speech the night of the runoff and so i'm listening
[02:01:55.520 --> 02:02:00.040]  to his speech listening to his speech and he he goes into his thank yous thank you so
[02:02:00.040 --> 02:02:06.040]  and so thank you so so thank you george bush and i'm like whoa where did that come from
[02:02:06.040 --> 02:02:10.080]  you know it's like wow and so hopefully an info warrior can find that i've looked for
[02:02:10.080 --> 02:02:15.120]  it on the web it's the victory speech that he gave when he won ted cruz's texas senate
[02:02:15.120 --> 02:02:20.800]  victory speech i remember it was when he won the primary so there's a little there's a
[02:02:20.800 --> 02:02:25.160]  little tidbit on that now here's a different info nugget you're talking about the chinese
[02:02:25.160 --> 02:02:29.280]  the trade war potentially brewing up and all that well we shot a bunch of video in
[02:02:29.280 --> 02:02:32.600]  iowa some of it didn't get put up cause we shot so much it takes a while to process
[02:02:32.600 --> 02:02:37.760]  anyway we were at a jeff bush event and it was matt weber and i matt and i went to jeff
[02:02:37.760 --> 02:02:43.720]  bush event and we encountered this young chinese man probably mid twenties he had to be one
[02:02:43.720 --> 02:02:47.840]  of the elite i mean he's at a jeff bush event right and on the hop of that he was about six
[02:02:47.840 --> 02:02:52.800]  foot four he wasn't a regular chinese man and he was like and i said where are you from
[02:02:52.800 --> 02:02:58.560]  and he said he traveled all the way from china to be at a cedar rapids iowa jeff bush event
[02:02:58.560 --> 02:03:03.520]  so tell me how important jeff bush family is to the chinese i mean we saw henry kiss
[02:03:03.520 --> 02:03:08.120]  no it was his dad opened it up and made the whole deal to screw america absolutely henry
[02:03:08.120 --> 02:03:12.520]  kissinger started to crack there for the open door to china you know we know what henry
[02:03:12.520 --> 02:03:18.480]  kissinger did with saudi arabia and then like you said george senior poppy bush really
[02:03:18.480 --> 02:03:22.440]  took our industry and started taking it over china and the bushes are these total enemies
[02:03:22.440 --> 02:03:27.320]  of this country absolutely and uh switching gears a little bit zika i haven't really had
[02:03:27.320 --> 02:03:31.720]  a chance to totally look into it and we i know there's been so much news but are the
[02:03:31.720 --> 02:03:35.600]  new world order fingerprints all over zika or what they are they are richard credible
[02:03:35.600 --> 02:03:40.360]  so that that's another brewery that's your Rockefeller foundation souped up weapon that
[02:03:40.360 --> 02:03:44.680]  actually says that from the fifties and then it's tied in the billable indicates as usual

[02:04:54.240 --> 02:05:01.800]  globally lou rockwell on the big fix 2016 nearly 40 volcanoes are currently erupted across
[02:05:01.800 --> 02:05:05.720]  the world and scientists warned that the current conditions could trigger at least four record
[02:05:05.720 --> 02:05:09.880]  breaking earthquakes the earthquakes that just hit recently have left over 270 dead in ecuador
[02:05:09.880 --> 02:05:14.440]  and over 42 dead in japan with a mass evacuations continuing out of fear of aftershocks and
[02:05:14.440 --> 02:05:18.800]  scientists at tokyo university estimate there's at least a 70 percent chance that japan will
[02:05:18.800 --> 02:05:23.000]  eventually suffer from another earthquake equivalent to the great kanto of 1923 which
[02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:28.120]  measured 8.9 and killed over 142,000 people and other scientists also fear a full blown
[02:05:28.120 --> 02:05:32.440]  eruption of the yellowstone national park volcano which could have up to 2000 times
[02:05:32.440 --> 02:05:36.840]  the power of the mount st helens eruption of 1980 some even speculate that the volcanic
[02:05:36.840 --> 02:05:40.640]  winter resulting from a yellowstone eruption could devastate america's food supply and
[02:05:40.640 --> 02:05:45.280]  could even cool the planet 20 degrees the volcanic ash could even blanket areas a thousand
[02:05:45.280 --> 02:05:48.920]  miles away and there's already signs and eruption could happen a few weeks ago river
[02:05:48.920 --> 02:05:52.840]  near the super volcanoes started to boil and the volcano itself is blasting out even more

[02:08:25.560 --> 02:08:31.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, the next hour Lou Rockwell of LouRockwell.com and the head of the Yvonne
[02:08:31.800 --> 02:08:36.680]  Mies Institute will be our guest. I intend the last 20 minutes or so to open the phones up and

[02:08:43.400 --> 02:08:50.520]  800-259-9231. I'm Alex Jones your host InfoWars.com is obviously our main site.
[02:08:50.520 --> 02:08:58.520]  Wow, where to begin? We now see America under global governance to a great extent, secret trade
[02:08:58.520 --> 02:09:05.320]  deal signed. We see elections being openly canceled all over the country and Ted Cruz calling it a
[02:09:05.320 --> 02:09:12.200]  grassroots victory. Are we seeing the death throws of the out of control political class or are we
[02:09:12.200 --> 02:09:19.320]  seeing their complete takeover and a victory? I think it's up to us to decide that but if you go
[02:09:19.320 --> 02:09:26.040]  back to two months ago quote it makes perfect sense that Donald Trump is a 9-11 truther February 15th
[02:09:26.920 --> 02:09:31.320]  and then you go to the article in South Carolina on Saturday night Donald Trump turned into an
[02:09:31.320 --> 02:09:36.440]  Alex Jones show caller and what they always do is misrepresent what we've said.
[02:09:38.680 --> 02:09:44.120]  Saudi Arabia had 15 of the 19 hijackers. I talked to the FBI agents, the translators,
[02:09:44.120 --> 02:09:49.240]  the whistleblowers. I interviewed them all. They were ordered to stand down before on and after
[02:09:49.800 --> 02:09:53.320]  by criminal elements in our government. The media spun it that I was saying there was
[02:09:53.320 --> 02:09:56.600]  any radical Islam. Of course there is. We stand firmly against it.
[02:09:58.440 --> 02:10:04.120]  Circus Soleil is canceling coming to different states that pass laws protecting Christians free
[02:10:04.120 --> 02:10:10.440]  speech but they're going to go to countries in the Middle East that chop gay people's heads off.
[02:10:10.440 --> 02:10:17.400]  While the left pushes for massive censorship across America and calls Donald Trump Hitler
[02:10:18.760 --> 02:10:24.200]  while the communist Chinese under Mao that killed over 84 million people according to them
[02:10:26.200 --> 02:10:29.560]  lecture us. Anybody's close to Hitler if the communist Chinese
[02:10:32.120 --> 02:10:36.920]  and the reason I open up with the fact that it's in the Associated Press it's in the New York Times
[02:10:36.920 --> 02:10:44.760]  it's in the New York Post look at these headlines headlines that's a new term I have for but what
[02:10:44.760 --> 02:10:50.120]  happens when they start telling the truth what happens when they're forced to get it out in the
[02:10:50.120 --> 02:10:59.160]  open this is the collapse of the facade Saudi Arabia threatens to pull 750 billion from the U.S.
[02:10:59.160 --> 02:11:04.200]  economy of Congress allows them to be sued for 911 terror attacks. Here's another headline New
[02:11:04.200 --> 02:11:10.760]  York Post how U.S. covered up Saudi role in 911 Saudi Arabia warrants of economic fallout of
[02:11:10.760 --> 02:11:18.360]  Congress praises 911 bill passes it Saudi Arabia warrants of economic fallout these are the threats
[02:11:19.080 --> 02:11:25.800]  of a hereditary dictatorship like North Korea who got their power from British intelligence
[02:11:25.800 --> 02:11:31.720]  in 1901 they controlled about 200 square miles along a key caravan route where they would rob
[02:11:31.720 --> 02:11:39.160]  people including capturing women and children to be used as sex slaves if anybody is bad
[02:11:40.120 --> 02:11:43.560]  it's not Donald Trump it's Saudi Arabia and the communist Chinese leadership
[02:11:45.240 --> 02:11:48.680]  and the reason I preface this with all that is I wanted to get Lou Rockwell on for a few weeks
[02:11:48.680 --> 02:11:53.640]  he's a busy guy about the election theft and we're going to cover that look at this daily
[02:11:53.640 --> 02:11:59.400]  male headline Cruz claims he's won landslides over and over beating Trump in five consecutive
[02:11:59.400 --> 02:12:05.480]  states even though only one of them had an election and then in other states like Louisiana,
[02:12:05.480 --> 02:12:15.960]  Tennessee, Arizona, Georgia, Trump wins and then they just give the delegates before they even go
[02:12:15.960 --> 02:12:23.000]  to the convention to Cruz and the reason I want to get Lou Rockwell on he helped get Ron Paul in
[02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:27.240]  Congress he's worked in Congress he was a chief of staff before he went on to be the best selling
[02:12:27.240 --> 02:12:31.400]  author and head of the Von Mies Institute and the rest of it and found the popular news site
[02:12:31.400 --> 02:12:38.360]  LouRockwell.com as a political expert and elections expert what his view is on all of this and where
[02:12:38.360 --> 02:12:42.520]  he sees this going and I want to ask him again I have some major issues with Donald Trump just
[02:12:42.520 --> 02:12:48.680]  like Ron Paul does but the fact that they're so scared of him and that he is a nationalist
[02:12:49.800 --> 02:12:53.960]  is why I'm supporting him because at this point I'm just supporting open elections
[02:12:53.960 --> 02:12:59.320]  Lou Rockwell am I wrong in saying this is one of the most epic times in the history of the United
[02:12:59.320 --> 02:13:07.800]  States I mean it has a 1776 feel to it or am I wrong are we at that crossroads that you and Ron
[02:13:07.800 --> 02:13:13.960]  Paul have warned about for 30 years? Well Alex I certainly hope so I mean I think we definitely
[02:13:13.960 --> 02:13:20.280]  we need a an ideological and a moral upheaval in this country and it's why the regime the
[02:13:20.280 --> 02:13:27.320]  neocons the republican establishment the democratic establishment the academic establishment the
[02:13:27.320 --> 02:13:33.480]  corporate establishment on bankers and all these people fear populism because it it riles up the
[02:13:33.480 --> 02:13:39.880]  people it says you know what you're being ripped off not only are there are there are there bad
[02:13:39.880 --> 02:13:44.040]  ideologically they're stealing from you they're ripping you off they're taking your freedom they're
[02:13:44.040 --> 02:13:51.400]  taking your money and they're all living very well thanks to it so Trump has the ability to
[02:13:51.400 --> 02:13:57.240]  really connect to people and like you and Ron I have many differences with Mr. Trump on the issues
[02:13:57.240 --> 02:14:02.200]  although I think where but there all these guys are bad on trade from my standpoint they're all
[02:14:02.200 --> 02:14:07.400]  bad on all the issues that Trump is bad on they're all bad on on the other hand the places where
[02:14:07.400 --> 02:14:15.160]  Trump is good whether it's immigration or the political correctness movement or the especially
[02:14:15.160 --> 02:14:21.000]  foreign policy questions of war and peace he's uniquely different and better than the others
[02:14:22.120 --> 02:14:28.680]  is he for real you know I after so many years of watching this stuff I'm sure you forgive me if
[02:14:28.680 --> 02:14:35.640]  I'm not a hundred percent sure but I think he's stirring up just tremendous outrage among the
[02:14:35.640 --> 02:14:41.000]  American people tapping into that outrage we've seen it even in the polls people in more and more
[02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:45.800]  distrust the government they distrust the big media they know there are things are desperately
[02:14:45.800 --> 02:14:50.600]  wrong they fear for themselves they fear for their children and their grandchildren they just are
[02:14:50.600 --> 02:14:54.600]  very worried about what's happening in this kind of they all know this is not the same America they
[02:14:54.600 --> 02:15:01.800]  grew up in and they don't like it so Trump is stirring everybody up you know we'll see what
[02:15:01.800 --> 02:15:06.200]  happens I should just mention by the way the music institute is not a political or a partisan
[02:15:06.200 --> 02:15:11.640]  organization so I'm simply giving my own views when I when I talk about some of these things about
[02:15:11.640 --> 02:15:18.840]  Trump sure you guys promote Austrian economics yes and libertarianism but I will say that I think
[02:15:18.840 --> 02:15:26.840]  Trump is doing a whole lot of good he's scaring everybody evil I mean if you look at the people
[02:15:26.840 --> 02:15:32.120]  who really hate the guys of Trump it's like a who's who of the creeps of the country so that
[02:15:32.120 --> 02:15:38.440]  has to tell us something and he's just much better on foreign policy when we're facing people I think
[02:15:38.440 --> 02:15:44.600]  probably Hillary is the worst the most likely to start a world war three Cruz is probably not far
[02:15:44.600 --> 02:15:51.960]  away from her when we're facing people like that Trump I think is the least likely to start a war
[02:15:51.960 --> 02:15:55.640]  he actually I think that's the best thing he doesn't want to just randomly start a war with Russia
[02:15:55.640 --> 02:16:00.600]  they have two bases they're doing nothing to us we're funding ISIS against him and that's what I
[02:16:00.600 --> 02:16:04.680]  like best is the fact that he wants us to be strong to be able to defend ourselves but says we're
[02:16:04.680 --> 02:16:09.320]  not just going to go around attacking people and listen I do the same calculus you engage in Lou
[02:16:09.320 --> 02:16:14.280]  I look at him and I say look I don't just trust somebody off their rhetoric but when I see true
[02:16:14.280 --> 02:16:19.320]  palpable fear hundreds and hundreds of millions thrown against him by the republic and the democratic
[02:16:19.320 --> 02:16:25.720]  establishment the stealing of the election they're so desperate openly desperately the Chinese
[02:16:25.720 --> 02:16:32.520]  communists the socialist pope the Mexican presidents and former presidents and Hollywood and the
[02:16:32.520 --> 02:16:38.520]  kitchen sink I've been told by high-level Trump people and I'm just gonna leave it at that that
[02:16:38.520 --> 02:16:44.360]  he really is a closet libertarian a closet anti-new world order guy and more and more he comes out
[02:16:44.360 --> 02:16:50.040]  against Saudi Arabia he comes out against China I mean I really think it's true more and more
[02:16:50.040 --> 02:16:55.480]  and so I think that's why this was here he comes out against NATO he asked why why should we have
[02:16:55.480 --> 02:17:00.040]  all the why should we have all these bases all over the world if you look at a map of US bases
[02:17:00.040 --> 02:17:06.120]  they surround Russia there aren't any Russian bases surrounding the US US feels they're perfectly
[02:17:06.120 --> 02:17:12.360]  fine to send destroyers armed with who knows what kinds of weapons very close to st. Petersburg and
[02:17:12.360 --> 02:17:18.280]  and Russian territory and the Russians are supposed to just think that's fine you can imagine what
[02:17:18.280 --> 02:17:22.200]  would happen if the Russians sent a bunch of destroyers into the Gulf of Mexico can you imagine
[02:17:22.200 --> 02:17:26.760]  if there were 50 Russian ships around the US I'd be calling for blowing them up well I mean there
[02:17:26.760 --> 02:17:32.040]  would be you know the US would be blowing them up so and you know the US of course as we're told
[02:17:32.040 --> 02:17:37.000]  by all the neocons and all the creeps is the exceptional nation the rules that apply to everybody
[02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:41.800]  else don't apply to the US just like they would argue that the rules that apply to all the other
[02:17:41.800 --> 02:17:47.160]  human beings where does this arrogance come from the bushes well I you know I think it has something
[02:17:47.160 --> 02:17:51.560]  to do with government you know if you go I don't like to go to Washington but one of the things
[02:17:51.560 --> 02:17:56.040]  that always strikes me about Washington is the level of arrogance I mean these people even walk
[02:17:56.040 --> 02:18:01.480]  arrogantly they talk arrogantly they all think of themselves as being at the center of the empire
[02:18:01.480 --> 02:18:06.840]  and therefore they're very very important of course they're not important but US feels it
[02:18:06.840 --> 02:18:11.240]  should rule the world the solar system you know whatever they believe their history's actors
[02:18:11.240 --> 02:18:16.760]  are so forth well they they believe that you know is it any different the Roman Empire or the
[02:18:16.760 --> 02:18:22.280]  Babylonians or the Egyptians or the British or all all these empires in the history of the world
[02:18:22.280 --> 02:18:27.640]  have this kind of arrogance everybody else is just dirt under their feet their boots should be under
[02:18:27.640 --> 02:18:33.080]  throat and of course most of all they concentrate on the people they fear the most which is not foreigners
[02:18:33.080 --> 02:18:38.680]  it's Americans so they're worried about Americans tossing off the yoke and so when they see something
[02:18:38.680 --> 02:18:43.480]  like what's happening with Trump it's why they're so desperate I'm afraid they may be successful
[02:18:43.480 --> 02:18:49.480]  but it's why they're so desperate to deny him the nomination why they're willing to be openly rip
[02:18:49.480 --> 02:18:55.160]  off with these ripoff festivals in Colorado and elsewhere where they're going to take his delegates
[02:18:55.880 --> 02:19:01.800]  very few maybe a half of the Trump delegates will actually be Trump supporters maybe a half of them
[02:19:01.800 --> 02:19:08.920]  will be will be like double agents so if they can deny him the nomination on the first ballot
[02:19:08.920 --> 02:19:14.040]  and that's of course what they're working very hard to do I think he's not he's not going to get it
[02:19:14.040 --> 02:19:20.120]  probably is going to be Cruz or you know I don't think they can actually get away with bringing
[02:19:20.120 --> 02:19:24.120]  Paul Ryan Lou I want to get into that I want to get into that with Lou Rockwell of Lou Rockwell
[02:19:24.120 --> 02:19:29.640]  dot com speaking to us today from the Mises Institute Mises dot org key information obviously
[02:19:29.640 --> 02:19:34.360]  there on economics and libertarianism and in true free market through the dollar you know through
[02:19:34.360 --> 02:19:39.880]  voting with our our decisions but getting back to what you mentioned you will know someone by
[02:19:39.880 --> 02:19:45.480]  their friends and their enemies I've never seen such a laundry list and I'm kind of ashamed of
[02:19:45.480 --> 02:19:51.320]  Americans and that there's not even more support for Trump when the whole world's bossing us around
[02:19:51.320 --> 02:19:58.520]  I mean this is really pathetic like we're some colonialized controlled nation run by multinationals
[02:19:58.520 --> 02:20:05.240]  but I guess that's what it's come down to you know I I hark back to one of the seconders for
[02:20:05.240 --> 02:20:11.400]  Grover Cleveland's second nomination for president and the man nominating talked about it how great
[02:20:11.400 --> 02:20:15.640]  Cleveland's first term had been and it was be so wonderful he the second term how he was great in
[02:20:15.640 --> 02:20:22.040]  so many ways but then he said you know we love him most for the enemies he has made so I mean it
[02:20:22.040 --> 02:20:28.520]  does say something about a man who his enemies are who hates him and in Trump's case I mean you're
[02:20:28.520 --> 02:20:33.640]  it's it's definitely a rogue's gallery it's like a you know the one of those books in the police
[02:20:33.640 --> 02:20:37.400]  station with all the photos of the criminals that's what you know they're gonna have the book of the
[02:20:37.400 --> 02:20:42.840]  anti-trumpians that's what it would look like and you should have them facing front and facing to the
[02:20:42.840 --> 02:20:49.240]  side these are these are very bad people George Soros and I mean now you know we get on the list
[02:20:49.240 --> 02:20:56.760]  of all the people who've dedicated their billions to destroying this country to to changing things
[02:20:56.760 --> 02:21:02.760]  radically in the worst kind of a way these are people who you know in some sense there are aspects
[02:21:02.760 --> 02:21:07.320]  of communism they want to bring here we already have some aspects of communism with the Fed and
[02:21:07.320 --> 02:21:13.320]  other government programs now they'd like to make it worse they want to of course inundate us with
[02:21:13.320 --> 02:21:17.720]  welfare immigrants and all the rest of the all the rest of the horrible things they're doing
[02:21:17.720 --> 02:21:22.520]  let's talk about their policy Rockwell yes sir but but first getting back into the election
[02:21:22.520 --> 02:21:26.040]  since you mentioned it you know you've been chief of staff around Paul you've run congressional
[02:21:26.040 --> 02:21:31.800]  campaigns successfully have you ever seen a steal this blatant and what do you expect to see next
[02:21:31.800 --> 02:21:38.040]  I mean your expert view on the election well the I wasn't there to see it but the 52 Republican
[02:21:38.040 --> 02:21:45.560]  convention chaired by Earl Warren stole the nomination from Bob Taft who was sort of the
[02:21:45.560 --> 02:21:50.920]  Ron Paul of his day great man and gave it to Dwight Eisenhower who was the establishment candidate
[02:21:50.920 --> 02:21:56.600]  the Rockefeller the Rockefeller candidate Murray Rothbard always said if only Robert Welch had
[02:21:56.600 --> 02:22:01.000]  referred to Eisenhower as a conscious dedicated agent of the Rockefeller conspiracy you would
[02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:10.200]  have been exactly right so they what they did was they threw out elected and Taft delegates
[02:22:10.200 --> 02:22:14.760]  and installed in the convention Eisenhower delegates in various states to give Eisenhower
[02:22:14.760 --> 02:22:19.480]  the nomination but there was no social media in those days was just the establishment press
[02:22:19.480 --> 02:22:26.680]  who were of course cheering for for Ike and they got away with it then I don't think they're going
[02:22:26.680 --> 02:22:31.400]  to get away with it this time they may get away with giving the nomination to the creep of the
[02:22:31.400 --> 02:22:35.320]  moment but I think they're not going to get away with it with the American people I think
[02:22:35.320 --> 02:22:40.040]  this means and I would love to see it got my fingers crossed the demolition of the Republican
[02:22:40.040 --> 02:22:45.800]  party I come out of the Republican party before going straight and I'd love to see them go down
[02:22:45.800 --> 02:22:50.040]  they really are a rotten organization yes there are good people who are Republicans
[02:22:50.040 --> 02:22:55.720]  but the establishment of the party in the states in the national party in the senate in the congress
[02:22:55.720 --> 02:23:00.600]  in the chivalry in the various bureaucracies these are evil people these are awful people
[02:23:00.600 --> 02:23:07.000]  and to see their their little game taken away how sweet it would be blue rockwell's our guest
[02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:11.160]  separately I want to get back into the campaign and back into other big issues that are in your
[02:23:11.160 --> 02:23:18.120]  radar but the economy the big bubble the big event that you've talked about so long the
[02:23:18.120 --> 02:23:22.040]  Federal Reserve saying we're gonna you know just go back to zero interest rates the IMF the World Bank
[02:23:23.080 --> 02:23:27.960]  Trump's talking about the big bubble China's imploding you really are first and foremost an
[02:23:27.960 --> 02:23:32.520]  economic expert what are the other experts at the Mises Institute saying about what's happening
[02:23:32.520 --> 02:23:38.040]  well first of all another thing they've attacked trump for is saying there is a bubble and as he
[02:23:38.040 --> 02:23:43.400]  thinks is very dangerous bubble and he fears that it's going to pop and of course he's exactly
[02:23:43.400 --> 02:23:48.600]  right there is a huge bubble that's been pumped up by the Fed in order to reward wall street in
[02:23:48.600 --> 02:23:54.200]  order to make stocks go up in order to make Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan and all the rest of these
[02:23:54.200 --> 02:24:00.040]  these firms even richer than they are so that's been that's been the deliberate policy now of
[02:24:00.040 --> 02:24:04.280]  course we're going to have negative interest rates zero zero interest rate that's already
[02:24:04.280 --> 02:24:10.920]  unnatural and unbelievably economically destructive because the Fed holding interest rates near zero
[02:24:10.920 --> 02:24:17.240]  but of course they're going to bring them below zero same time they want to outlaw cash because
[02:24:17.240 --> 02:24:22.600]  one of the problems for them with zero interest rates or even negative interest rates people think
[02:24:22.600 --> 02:24:27.080]  that why should I heck should I keep my money in the bank when they're charging me a fee
[02:24:27.080 --> 02:24:32.200]  much better to take it out and either keep it just in cash or buy gold so in order to prevent that
[02:24:32.200 --> 02:24:37.240]  from happening they want to outlaw cash they do not want you to be able to you can transfer your
[02:24:37.240 --> 02:24:42.200]  money from bank a to bank b of course they're okay with that but you're not going to be allowed to
[02:24:42.200 --> 02:24:46.920]  take your money out of the form of cash this is what they'd like so they're talking you know about
[02:24:46.920 --> 02:24:51.720]  what politically correct person is going to be on which dollar bill which 20 or the 10 or whatever
[02:24:51.720 --> 02:24:57.080]  course i must say i think they're all pretty awful if you get on the uh you get on one of the us
[02:24:57.080 --> 02:25:02.680]  notes uh you're pretty awful the late bird blumbert used to uh hark back to the days when
[02:25:02.680 --> 02:25:09.000]  us coins and notes had no politicians on them but had lady liberty or american indian or buffalo
[02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:13.640]  or things like that and he said that uh you know things have taken a bad step when they
[02:25:13.640 --> 02:25:17.880]  started to put politicians on the money although he said the actual worst step when you really need
[02:25:17.880 --> 02:25:22.840]  to watch out is when they put living politicians on the money and that's not quite not quite there
[02:25:22.840 --> 02:25:27.000]  but is there going to be an obama 10 dollar bill at some point i don't think we can rule it out
[02:25:27.960 --> 02:25:33.240]  these people are so arrogant so crazy they'll be right back to to to caesar and that's what scares
[02:25:33.240 --> 02:25:37.720]  me they have all these advanced weapons they're totally arrogant everything they're doing now
[02:25:38.280 --> 02:25:43.080]  basically falls on its face but they don't care they just move forward speaking of that
[02:25:43.080 --> 02:25:48.520]  that how big a deal is it to see all the big newspapers talking about us government stood
[02:25:48.520 --> 02:25:54.920]  down on 9 11 us government covered up for soddies that has got to really scare the power structure
[02:25:55.480 --> 02:26:00.840]  well i think it's i think it's great of course those 28 first of all the whole 9 11 report is
[02:26:00.840 --> 02:26:05.960]  i should like put this highly flawed uh as ron paul and you've said we need an honest
[02:26:05.960 --> 02:26:11.800]  investigation of those events uh but the you know of course it all should be published
[02:26:11.800 --> 02:26:17.560]  and the soddies are a very corrupt and rotten regime they are allowed to get away with all
[02:26:17.560 --> 02:26:22.680]  kinds of things that nobody else is because i don't want to shock anybody they pay off american
[02:26:22.680 --> 02:26:28.120]  politicians there's huge money involved if you go over there and kiss their hand hold their hand
[02:26:28.120 --> 02:26:35.320]  like the george h bush george hw bush and george w bush used to do obama you know saluting and uh
[02:26:35.320 --> 02:26:39.960]  bowing to them and so forth he's getting the big bucks in return and maybe when he's in office
[02:26:39.960 --> 02:26:44.440]  maybe it's when he's out of office but they have a lot of money to hand around washington
[02:26:44.440 --> 02:26:49.720]  got a lot of people on the payroll so if this actually happens no i think it's a great thing
[02:26:49.720 --> 02:26:54.840]  and i hope it will encourage more interest in this i was thrilled to see that uh you know
[02:26:54.840 --> 02:27:02.600]  wane madson is questioning whether uh rafael cruz uh ted cruz's father might have had some
[02:27:02.600 --> 02:27:07.400]  very shady connections back in the days of the anti-cuban exiles involved with the cia
[02:27:07.400 --> 02:27:13.960]  and the kennedy assassination so maybe cruz's ties to the regime go much deeper than any of us have
[02:27:13.960 --> 02:27:18.360]  thought i mean we've always known as roger stone points out he's a bush republican with a history
[02:27:18.360 --> 02:27:23.240]  of being a bush republican but maybe he's a bush republican and even uh even a deeper
[02:27:23.240 --> 02:27:29.320]  and more important sense but the whole the the regime is corrupt the deep state is corrupt
[02:27:29.320 --> 02:27:35.000]  the empire is corrupt it's economically corrupt and that maybe is what's going to bring it down
[02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:41.080]  not only what trump and uh other people are doing it to uh make the american people feel
[02:27:41.080 --> 02:27:45.320]  we don't have to put up with this we're actually not it's not written in stone
[02:27:45.320 --> 02:27:50.120]  that we have to take it we don't have to take it so that's very very important but also the
[02:27:50.120 --> 02:27:56.760]  negative interest rates uh the banks getting um shakier and shakier the dollar getting shakier
[02:27:56.760 --> 02:28:02.920]  the whole the whole world empire of finance getting shakier this is this you know there's
[02:28:02.920 --> 02:28:07.880]  real trouble ahead on that on that uh on that is when of course they've continued to build the police
[02:28:07.880 --> 02:28:13.640]  state here at home i mean these are really a very bad bunch of people u.s. government the biggest
[02:28:13.640 --> 02:28:19.000]  richest most powerful government in the history of the world by many magnitudes to get stolen or
[02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:25.560]  whatever uh listally didn't try to tell you the size of your toilet tank so we you have the u.s.
[02:28:25.560 --> 02:28:30.040]  is it soft or not to use the word mother or father in public schools across the country
[02:28:30.040 --> 02:28:33.960]  on the literature when you enroll your kids don't use what mother or father that's offensive
[02:28:33.960 --> 02:28:38.520]  well that would be bigoted alex you know that so no these people these people are uh
[02:28:39.320 --> 02:28:44.040]  are you know just unbelievable at the whole sjw business which is like the official
[02:28:44.680 --> 02:28:48.600]  the official part of the regime again not saying mother and father might hurt somebody's
[02:28:49.480 --> 02:28:57.400]  feelings can't say male or female you can't say his or hers i mean yes i do think there's
[02:28:57.400 --> 02:29:02.440]  huge opposition to it even though it's suppressed i think trump is calling on this opposition
[02:29:02.440 --> 02:29:07.960]  is helping stir it up rise it up you know people get courage when somebody is so they see somebody
[02:29:07.960 --> 02:29:13.240]  else speaking out when they they know what he's saying is true uh this is true for ron paul that's
[02:29:13.240 --> 02:29:19.240]  right he's a bellwether he's a bellwether on populism rising i'm going to ask you what you would do

[02:30:32.600 --> 02:30:37.240]  in establishment media is fueled by an accurate season reporting and deceptive bias another study

[02:34:05.720 --> 02:34:11.160]  watching fox news on the elliptical this morning and they go he's calling for violence uh and then
[02:34:11.160 --> 02:34:18.040]  they cut to the clip and it's not trump calling for violence i have never seen the gloves off like
[02:34:18.040 --> 02:34:23.800]  this and they can barely try to suppress trump i mean it's it's neck and neck right now and it
[02:34:23.800 --> 02:34:32.440]  shows their power is waning the question is will they start a huge war or do something catastrophic
[02:34:32.440 --> 02:34:37.640]  like kim jung unthreatens before they get unseated from power and the bigger question is is it our
[02:34:37.640 --> 02:34:42.520]  own weakness that has empowered these people i think it's a little bit of both before i go any
[02:34:42.520 --> 02:34:48.120]  further we have a limited edition hillary for prison shirt that's almost like the old one that was
[02:34:48.120 --> 02:34:53.960]  the last limited edition but people really wanted us to bring it back so we did and it's got hillary
[02:34:53.960 --> 02:35:00.520]  for prison 2016 looks like a campaign shirt and our camera crews are all over the country at at
[02:35:00.520 --> 02:35:04.280]  different political events and people are seeing them everywhere they're getting all over the news
[02:35:04.280 --> 02:35:12.120]  uh course obviously donald trump's talked about the shirts as well we've got them in all sizes available
[02:35:12.760 --> 02:35:19.560]  printed up and made right here in good old america it has a 4.9 star review out of a possible five
[02:35:19.560 --> 02:35:26.040]  stars that's from a third party review site power reviews we've got another variant of it that's also
[02:35:26.040 --> 02:35:30.280]  a collector's item with her as the joker and this is because she needs to be arrested she's
[02:35:30.280 --> 02:35:34.680]  threatened everybody she's told comedy clubs don't make fun of me or i'll have you you know basically
[02:35:34.680 --> 02:35:39.160]  indicted or the iris will come after you so this is our big middle finger to hillary to say listen
[02:35:39.160 --> 02:35:45.480]  we're going to exercise free speech and the moral here is so clear you either use free speech or you
[02:35:45.480 --> 02:35:49.880]  lose it it's like muscles don't let a matrophy and know your support in the broadcast when you get
[02:35:49.880 --> 02:35:54.760]  the shirt we kind of have a not a rip off of the trump hats that come in next week it's the same
[02:35:54.760 --> 02:36:00.600]  design same company a big old redneck hat i love it so obnoxious says make america free again
[02:36:00.600 --> 02:36:04.440]  because before america can be great again she must be free again it's freedom
[02:36:04.440 --> 02:36:08.360]  made us so great we weren't even that free but compared to other countries we were uh so it's
[02:36:08.360 --> 02:36:13.640]  the idea that was great in america about its individualism not what group you're in not what
[02:36:13.640 --> 02:36:18.840]  gang but what marlin with her king said the content of what you actually stand for i don't
[02:36:18.840 --> 02:36:22.920]  care what color you are if you cook good food i'm going to your restaurant i don't care what color
[02:36:22.920 --> 02:36:27.080]  you are you play good music i'm going to hear you i don't care what color you are if you're a good
[02:36:27.080 --> 02:36:32.920]  actor i'm going to go watch you in the movie i mean i love actors of every stripe and we've
[02:36:32.920 --> 02:36:38.600]  people fundamentally want to come together we're tribally based but how about a tribe based on
[02:36:38.600 --> 02:36:42.760]  free market economics that i want to spend a few minutes on with lure rock wall here because it
[02:36:42.760 --> 02:36:49.640]  really is the answer i mean you study history it's not even a comparison to fascism or marxism
[02:36:49.640 --> 02:36:59.000]  or linenism or all these other isms that are out there oligarchy any of it it is the answer
[02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:03.080]  the problem is it creates a bunch of spoiled brat kids later who get conned by the beat next
[02:37:03.080 --> 02:37:07.000]  and the rest of them so we're going to talk to you in a moment but go to infowarstore.com

[02:38:22.200 --> 02:38:27.880]  minutes about the solution not crony groups not combines not monopolies not one sided trade deals
[02:38:27.880 --> 02:38:35.240]  for insiders tell us about lubig von mis the von mis institute austrian economics let's spend
[02:38:35.240 --> 02:38:39.240]  five minutes on that in a few minutes on any other subjects you want to cover and then some calls
[02:38:39.240 --> 02:38:46.440]  well alex it you know it just has to do as you point out with freedom so if we look at what
[02:38:47.080 --> 02:38:53.560]  has made us free frozen up the economy made it crony oriented made us all significantly poorer
[02:38:53.560 --> 02:38:58.280]  than we would be we are significantly poorer as a people because of the existence of all these
[02:38:58.280 --> 02:39:03.080]  federal programs these federal wars but if we have to look what's the worst thing the government
[02:39:03.080 --> 02:39:10.040]  does to us probably the federal reserve and the manipulation of the dollar the banks that whole
[02:39:10.040 --> 02:39:16.360]  apparatus bringing on recessions and depressions we're probably in a recession right now it's
[02:39:16.360 --> 02:39:23.240]  going to get worse maybe it won't be horrifically worse and certainly hope and pray but a lot of
[02:39:23.240 --> 02:39:29.480]  bad things happening economically the government regulations that impede entrepreneurs entrepreneurs
[02:39:29.480 --> 02:39:34.680]  are the spark plugs that are driving really the driving force of an economy the extent that they
[02:39:34.680 --> 02:39:42.680]  are hindered taxed and ordered about it makes us all poorer so all the government regulations
[02:39:42.680 --> 02:39:48.120]  across all the government spending the taxation which of course has bad civil liberties standpoint
[02:39:48.120 --> 02:39:53.960]  as well as ripping as a you know it's as well as a theft you may get mugged on the street by a
[02:39:53.960 --> 02:39:58.280]  private criminal but you're not necessarily going to you're not going to necessarily going to ruin
[02:39:58.280 --> 02:40:02.360]  your whole life and change everything else you do the government of course when they rip you off
[02:40:02.360 --> 02:40:07.160]  when they mug you you know in fact everything in your business everything you do as an entrepreneur
[02:40:07.800 --> 02:40:14.440]  has very very bad effects so really we need less government maybe we're going to get less
[02:40:14.440 --> 02:40:20.520]  government if if all you know all these troubles continue this constant attack on property rights
[02:40:20.520 --> 02:40:25.960]  that's what's going on in north carolina and these other states where the state government says
[02:40:25.960 --> 02:40:31.000]  if a restaurant wants to just have a male and female bathroom that's fine so they want to outlaw
[02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:36.360]  that and force a private restaurant to have the bathrooms that you know that you know that
[02:40:36.360 --> 02:40:41.800]  katlyn jenner or whatever it would like them to have that's just that's talk about fascism or
[02:40:41.800 --> 02:40:47.000]  socialism but that's you know there's very little freedom of association left in this country we
[02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:52.440]  should have freedom of association business people should be able to hire or fire whom they want
[02:40:52.440 --> 02:40:56.760]  just according to the contracts they make the government ought not to be involved there ought
[02:40:56.760 --> 02:41:02.600]  to be freedom of speech all the things that the government is attacking that's what we need so
[02:41:02.600 --> 02:41:06.920]  just a rule of thumb whoever the whatever the government is going after whoever the government
[02:41:06.920 --> 02:41:13.480]  is demonizing those are the people to be supported uh it's i think a a good just a general good rule
[02:41:13.480 --> 02:41:19.480]  of thumb even over that anything the government is telling you to believe don't believe it anything
[02:41:19.480 --> 02:41:24.040]  they're telling you to do it's not a good thing for you to do it maybe you'll do it from a prudential
[02:41:24.040 --> 02:41:28.520]  standpoint because of course they've got the guns we're not people of violence that's that's the
[02:41:28.520 --> 02:41:33.800]  government way uh we just want to educate people we want to change hearts we want to change minds
[02:41:33.800 --> 02:41:38.760]  and by the way as you keep pointing out if we change enough hearts and minds if people are
[02:41:38.760 --> 02:41:42.760]  willing to speak out if they're willing to act if they're willing to do it for themselves and
[02:41:42.760 --> 02:41:47.400]  their children their grandchildren their communities their churches their businesses everything they
[02:41:47.400 --> 02:41:53.480]  care about and love in their lives uh it is actually possible to undo what's going on we're not
[02:41:54.120 --> 02:41:59.160]  it's we're not frozen with our feet in cement to put up with this right forever it's not true
[02:41:59.160 --> 02:42:04.680]  well that's why they're trying to extinct any free market choice or any grassroots free market
[02:42:04.680 --> 02:42:09.960]  activity because you know no one can compete with free market that's why they have government schools
[02:42:09.960 --> 02:42:14.760]  and of course all these things from our standpoint from the standpoint of parents and students are a
[02:42:14.760 --> 02:42:18.040]  failure they're not a failure from the standpoint of the government the government would like to
[02:42:18.040 --> 02:42:23.800]  dumb us all down they'd like to extinguish critical thinking independent thinking and it's all it you
[02:42:23.800 --> 02:42:28.040]  know so their failure their great successes from the standpoint of the government but
[02:42:28.040 --> 02:42:33.800]  failures from our standpoint so we want to push back about everything the government is doing to us
[02:42:33.800 --> 02:42:41.160]  they have no right to take our money to run our lives to start wars how many millions of people
[02:42:41.160 --> 02:42:46.920]  has the u.s. government killed in its career of wars aggressive wars all over the world tens of
[02:42:46.920 --> 02:42:52.200]  millions of people i mean we talk about the crimes of the of the chinese communist and we should
[02:42:52.200 --> 02:42:56.840]  of the soviet communist and we definitely should of hitler and all his people we definitely should
[02:42:57.400 --> 02:43:01.800]  but the u.s. government uh is one of the great butchers in the history of mankind
[02:43:01.800 --> 02:43:07.240]  while of course going around and pretending to be morally superior so they're not morally superior
[02:43:07.240 --> 02:43:13.240]  they're morally inferior they have to be opposed uh first of all in our hearts and minds by our own
[02:43:13.240 --> 02:43:18.040]  learning we have to learn something about economics about something about politics i totally agree
[02:43:18.040 --> 02:43:21.560]  and and the way i get socialist to wake up is explaining that most these multinationals
[02:43:21.560 --> 02:43:26.600]  write the laws they're pretty much tax exempt they're the ones pushing socialism at the grass
[02:43:26.600 --> 02:43:31.800]  roots to make us dependent so that we don't get uppity so they can control and cut the cream
[02:43:31.800 --> 02:43:39.240]  off the top it's crony capitalism that that these people are setting up and then they scapegoat
[02:43:39.240 --> 02:43:44.360]  real free market he's been a few minutes describing plus history shown this what even a little of
[02:43:44.360 --> 02:43:51.320]  free market does is create such renaissance it quickly displaces the other systems just by choice
[02:43:51.320 --> 02:43:56.200]  in a bloodless revolution that's why they act like it's the devil and want to shut it down
[02:43:56.200 --> 02:44:04.120]  well of course it's true and even even as bad as things are today even as corrupt and as the fascist
[02:44:04.120 --> 02:44:09.080]  socialist as the u.s. government is it's it's the controls of the economy there are still great
[02:44:09.080 --> 02:44:15.800]  things happening so we can see wonderful entrepreneurs wonderful uh companies serving us
[02:44:15.800 --> 02:44:20.920]  wonderful uh products that are available to us there's still so much great stuff going on but
[02:44:20.920 --> 02:44:27.960]  yes it only requires amazingly enough just a small change to bring on much greater prosperity
[02:44:27.960 --> 02:44:33.480]  and there's no way of telling if we uh if we had a free market economy in this country sure we
[02:44:33.480 --> 02:44:38.120]  didn't have the federal car bunk over there in washington um uh diseaseing all of us and
[02:44:38.120 --> 02:44:42.920]  disease in the economy there's no telling how wealthy would everybody would be much wealthier
[02:44:42.920 --> 02:44:48.360]  there would never have been a society the current day america would look like uh appalachia compared
[02:44:48.360 --> 02:44:55.960]  to what uh could be the case so we're capable of uh socially much and by the way you dig deeper
[02:44:55.960 --> 02:45:01.640]  governments attacking families it's attacking all the all the uh indices of social health
[02:45:01.640 --> 02:45:07.000]  in order to make us serfs they all they don't want to make us poorer they want to control us
[02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:10.440]  it's the whole purpose of the immigration inundation and many other things they're doing
[02:45:10.440 --> 02:45:15.000]  that's because they're scared of what they call disruptive technologies and quote empowered
[02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:18.680]  individuals the pentagon even admits and jade helm they're practicing to take over the us
[02:45:18.680 --> 02:45:25.080]  domestically and they say we're worried about empowered individuals worried about new economies
[02:45:25.080 --> 02:45:29.080]  and new systems we don't control now i'm not demonizing our military itself but the controllers
[02:45:29.080 --> 02:45:33.880]  are giving them that mission you know the special forces says uh you know free the oppressor
[02:45:33.880 --> 02:45:40.680]  defending oppress they've totally turned into the opposite of that and there they are scared of the
[02:45:40.680 --> 02:45:45.560]  next innovation that will come from private industry in the next tinker's garage that'll
[02:45:45.560 --> 02:45:50.120]  overthrow all these monopolies they've created just think about any of us who've ever had anything
[02:45:50.120 --> 02:45:54.200]  to do with the government people who've been in the military people have to deal with bureaucracy
[02:45:54.200 --> 02:46:00.680]  all of us at the dmv or whatever the government as an institution is a very stupid thing it's
[02:46:00.680 --> 02:46:06.760]  just like a low iq thing it's not only not effective it's delivered you know it's massively
[02:46:06.760 --> 02:46:13.640]  uh just mass massively destructive and stupid whether it's bombing people whether it's
[02:46:13.640 --> 02:46:19.160]  economically bombing us uh it's just doing horrible things and there's of course a vast
[02:46:19.160 --> 02:46:23.080]  propaganda campaign to make you think they're doing you good and it's disconnected you don't
[02:46:23.080 --> 02:46:28.040]  have you don't know what's good for yourself but all the creeps the hillary's and the and the obamas
[02:46:28.040 --> 02:46:33.640]  and the paul ryan's and the all the rest of you know the cruises of the world they know what's best
[02:46:33.640 --> 02:46:39.240]  for you you know what uh no they don't they're in fact your enemies so if it doesn't show they're
[02:46:39.240 --> 02:46:44.440]  airing in the right place that they would try to run hillary and jab and and everybody's face
[02:46:44.440 --> 02:46:49.240]  i mean just shows they're just not well and also i think they're going to run they're going to run
[02:46:49.240 --> 02:46:55.800]  somebody in trump's place who's going to cause a lot of trouble for them and uh i just hope by the
[02:46:55.800 --> 02:47:00.440]  way that trump i wish to goodness trump are planning right now to run as an independent he'll
[02:47:00.440 --> 02:47:04.440]  still be able to run as an independent for quite a while he runs a libertarian they have ballot
[02:47:04.440 --> 02:47:08.920]  access yeah but the libertarians i'm sorry to say would never and would never nominate him i'd like
[02:47:08.920 --> 02:47:14.120]  to see it but i don't believe it's possible he would have to in my view have to run as an independent
[02:47:14.120 --> 02:47:18.680]  and richard winger who's the great ballot access guy i had a piece from him and the rockwell dot
[02:47:18.680 --> 02:47:24.440]  com the other day about how trump can run as an independent also existing parties he could get
[02:47:24.440 --> 02:47:29.800]  the reform party and so forth he could get on the ballot with it is possible for him to do it
[02:47:29.800 --> 02:47:33.560]  i think it's a very good thing to hold over the republican party's head for example
[02:47:33.560 --> 02:47:38.520]  i mean he's always said from the beginning he's only staying loyal to the party and the nominee
[02:47:38.520 --> 02:47:45.640]  if he's treated fairly well treated fairly he's you know it's he's they put a uh a ball and chain
[02:47:45.640 --> 02:47:53.800]  around both his legs so um it's he's you know very much uh justified in every sense to be
[02:47:53.800 --> 02:47:58.280]  getting ready to run as an independent if they steal the nomination from him it's incredible
[02:47:58.280 --> 02:48:03.000]  but i agree with you the way he could win as an independent i think i think they've miscalculated
[02:48:03.000 --> 02:48:07.560]  live i mean if they really i was looking at arrogant previces like a smiling vampire on
[02:48:07.560 --> 02:48:14.920]  fox news and then there's other curly mo huland arrogantly laugh they really think laughing at us
[02:48:14.920 --> 02:48:20.120]  what's weird is they laugh at us arrogantly rubbing it in it's like they're mentally ill or something
[02:48:20.120 --> 02:48:25.480]  well they they do laugh at us we're all laughable we're just the peons for the cash cows
[02:48:25.480 --> 02:48:31.800]  where our only job is to work hard and give them the money give them the power and let them live it
[02:48:31.800 --> 02:48:38.680]  up so they're a very bad bunch uh i want to call curly and all these people are of course uh just
[02:48:38.680 --> 02:48:42.440]  typical you're right let's take a few calls we're about to go to break let's get one in now
[02:48:42.440 --> 02:48:47.640]  lou rockwell's our guest i mean look my my job is easy now folks stuff is so out in the open since
[02:48:47.640 --> 02:48:51.640]  i've been on 21 years you've been fighting tyranny for 40 years lou i mean you agree with me just
[02:48:51.640 --> 02:48:57.560]  briefly that tyranny is now more brazen and open than ever our job is easier than ever yes that's
[02:48:57.560 --> 02:49:02.040]  true and i think more and more people are waking up young people are especially waking up because
[02:49:02.040 --> 02:49:07.480]  of the the student loans they face the getting degrees that are totally useless in the marketplace
[02:49:07.480 --> 02:49:12.200]  it's another big ripoff of course is the whole the whole education system designed and run by
[02:49:12.200 --> 02:49:18.280]  the government ripping off students and uh there's there is resistance teaching them for an economy
[02:49:18.280 --> 02:49:21.960]  that doesn't even exist kevin in canada you're on the air with lou rockwell go ahead with your
[02:49:21.960 --> 02:49:28.280]  question or comment i've been on x2 for two years that i've quit smoking for one year starting
[02:49:28.280 --> 02:49:33.960]  this month so i owe you a thank you for that wow i didn't know x2 to help with that i mean overall
[02:49:33.960 --> 02:49:40.840]  what did what did it do once you took it i'm not a doctor but my theory is is that it's cleaned
[02:49:40.840 --> 02:49:49.320]  out my thyroid which plays a huge part in your attitude the way you feel in cravings and i figure
[02:49:49.320 --> 02:49:55.080]  while i was smoking i was taking it i didn't take it to quit smoking but about eight months in i hated
[02:49:55.080 --> 02:50:01.080]  this taste of cigarettes and it wasn't doing anything for me when i would smoke them so literally i
[02:50:01.080 --> 02:50:06.920]  quit with my best friend and it's been a year i guess uh yeah well well true iodine deficiency
[02:50:06.920 --> 02:50:11.240]  is is is you die without it and there's no real iodine supplement out there that we discovered
[02:50:11.240 --> 02:50:15.160]  that's what we made our own with top scientists that's why it's such a huge i'm gonna skip this
[02:50:15.160 --> 02:50:18.440]  network break this is so important i want lou to have time to get to the other point because you were
[02:50:18.440 --> 02:50:22.760]  thank you for the testimony kevin but that's why everybody should get x2 it is true deep earth
[02:50:22.760 --> 02:50:28.920]  iodine unbound it turns purple blue on paper not red it's not bound stuff it's it's special
[02:50:28.920 --> 02:50:33.800]  and it's the good halogen and this is a huge conspiracy the government used to put it in the
[02:50:33.800 --> 02:50:38.920]  salt of a bad version mind you because they didn't want you know huge iq reductions in the country
[02:50:38.920 --> 02:50:42.680]  then they started taking it out again they put the bad halogen in the water that's the fluoride
[02:50:42.680 --> 02:50:47.720]  this is the answer to fluoride it's x2 and it's at infowarslife.com so thank you for the plug but
[02:50:47.720 --> 02:50:52.280]  getting back to lou rockwell it says you had a point here about senator sessions and nato control
[02:50:52.280 --> 02:50:58.760]  go ahead i mean i mean we uh i watch the show quite a bit so the video that you put out was
[02:50:58.760 --> 02:51:06.920]  senator sessions questioning leon panetta secretary of defense in regards to when united
[02:51:06.920 --> 02:51:12.200]  states has the authority to go to war now oh yes and he said when nato gives us the authorization
[02:51:12.200 --> 02:51:17.400]  he said we don't get it from congress now yeah that's that's powerful look what trump the powerful
[02:51:17.400 --> 02:51:22.120]  thing is look what trump said about nato he didn't put his friend down and say well the reason why
[02:51:22.120 --> 02:51:27.080]  i'm saying this is because of because of sessions but i can almost i can almost feel in the back of
[02:51:27.080 --> 02:51:33.000]  my mind that the reason why trump bring this up in the first place is because a good man like sessions
[02:51:33.000 --> 02:51:36.520]  actually bring it up to begin well here's the deal i'm not going to brag because it's actually
[02:51:36.520 --> 02:51:40.200]  dangerous they pay attention now and write stories about it but let me just tell you this
[02:51:41.800 --> 02:51:46.440]  unless donald trump is the greatest actor ever and he's conning everybody behind the scenes the
[02:51:46.440 --> 02:51:51.320]  last four or five years he's learned about all this stuff before he ran i was told this by a movie
[02:51:51.320 --> 02:51:56.920]  star who knows trump on records friends with him and you know the truth is trump is dolled
[02:51:56.920 --> 02:52:00.760]  into all this he's dolled into ron paul he's dolled into lou rockwell he's dolled into my show
[02:52:00.760 --> 02:52:05.720]  but specifically i was told ron paul lou rockwell and quite frankly i'm not going to get into it but
[02:52:05.720 --> 02:52:10.120]  the trump people are obviously gonna want to reach out to lou rockwell and other people uh believe me
[02:52:10.120 --> 02:52:15.160]  trump found out about all this like a decade ago he didn't believe it now he knows it's true he really
[02:52:15.160 --> 02:52:19.720]  he is an egomaniac i mean according to his inside sources he does want to save the country though
[02:52:19.720 --> 02:52:24.440]  he's a good egomaniac and he just doesn't like screwing people over he loves free market he's
[02:52:24.440 --> 02:52:27.560]  done some things you know that aren't perfect in the market you know once he's building something
[02:52:27.560 --> 02:52:31.160]  somebody's trying to stop him then he goes out you know i mean he is aggressive alpha male
[02:52:31.160 --> 02:52:35.400]  they're scared of him and the word is from a whole bunch of sources is that he and i keep
[02:52:35.400 --> 02:52:40.040]  getting told watch he's going to do this and he does it and so and i'm not going to talk about
[02:52:40.040 --> 02:52:45.960]  some of the behind-the-scenes stuff but the point is is that it's pretty scary to know that the
[02:52:45.960 --> 02:52:50.040]  establishment is this scared is what i'm saying uh that's a good point he makes though so there are
[02:52:50.040 --> 02:52:54.360]  sessions that makes a big deal out of being told you don't have authority over where we go to war
[02:52:54.360 --> 02:52:58.520]  with the authorization to attack syria which they finally helped defeat with ron paul's
[02:52:58.520 --> 02:53:03.720]  and of course senator paul's help and and of course ted cruz jumped on the bandwagon later
[02:53:03.720 --> 02:53:09.720]  but looking at that knowing that he's advised by folks like sessions that's that's a positive for
[02:53:09.720 --> 02:53:15.480]  me lou rockwell for sure i think it is and and uh it's very important to go after nato it's just
[02:53:15.480 --> 02:53:21.640]  one of the organization you know and then if albania is capable of getting the us into a third world
[02:53:21.640 --> 02:53:26.760]  war under this under under nato and there are other organizations like this the us has got these
[02:53:26.760 --> 02:53:31.480]  so-called alliances and they're actually imperial alliances with countries all over the world
[02:53:31.480 --> 02:53:35.800]  member how georgia tried to get us into war with russia yeah we need to get out we need to get out
[02:53:35.800 --> 02:53:41.000]  of out of nato we need a free europe by the way this is a method for the us to control europe
[02:53:41.000 --> 02:53:46.360]  uh they should be freed i'm sure they're sick and tired of being u.s colonies except for their
[02:53:46.360 --> 02:53:51.400]  the people at the top where it goes all on the payroll merkel merkel and the evil merkel and
[02:53:51.400 --> 02:53:57.240]  the cameron and uh halland and people of that sort but i have a lot of people in europe were ready
[02:53:57.240 --> 02:54:01.720]  for a change too by the way it's not just in this country this is an international freedom movement
[02:54:01.720 --> 02:54:07.000]  and i want to be clear the big mega banks that have hijacked this country that that that you know
[02:54:07.000 --> 02:54:13.160]  you know folks back to congress in the 1913 talked about they are doing all this in our name we're
[02:54:13.160 --> 02:54:17.880]  paying for it we don't even get a benefit and so we talk about the u.s occupying europe i agree
[02:54:17.880 --> 02:54:21.400]  technically that's what's happening but at the same time it's the very same corporate interests
[02:54:21.400 --> 02:54:26.200]  that are occupying europe are occupying us so we're all in this together is it the brexit exciting
[02:54:26.200 --> 02:54:33.000]  blue rockwell oh i think the brexit is i'm 100 for it this would be so fantastic if britain gets
[02:54:33.000 --> 02:54:39.800]  out of the u the u is an evil uh global government kind of institution highly bureaucratic ordering
[02:54:39.800 --> 02:54:46.440]  people around very corrupt very dangerous and uh all of europe needs to get out and it's great of
[02:54:46.440 --> 02:54:51.400]  all the opposition in eastern europe somehow the people who lived under communism are more freedom
[02:54:51.400 --> 02:54:56.440]  oriented than the people further west uh so maybe less because they've already enjoyed the total
[02:54:56.440 --> 02:55:03.160]  hungry in poland and uh slovakia check republic and so forth maybe these countries are gonna save
[02:55:03.160 --> 02:55:08.120]  europe maybe they're gonna set a good example for us and just you know i propose that your your
[02:55:08.120 --> 02:55:14.280]  collars point alex is so important to free yourself to the extent you can from the medical monopoly
[02:55:15.080 --> 02:55:21.400]  you know obama care and all that uh is dangerous to your health the extent you can be independent
[02:55:21.400 --> 02:55:27.080]  that you can take care of your own health uh very very important so don't just don't be a
[02:55:27.080 --> 02:55:32.280]  shill for the government in that way either uh that's all about obama care is designed to sicken
[02:55:32.280 --> 02:55:39.320]  you to get rich off you not to cure you of anything asked about you know about uh you know trump
[02:55:39.320 --> 02:55:44.120]  being an alpha male what you know uh what is wrong with that isn't it nice to have a masculine guy
[02:55:44.120 --> 02:55:50.280]  rather than a metrosexual i mean it seems to me trump trump is a nice change and i think it's why
[02:55:50.280 --> 02:55:54.600]  by the way he appeals to women much more than you would learn from the media although i think we all
[02:55:54.600 --> 02:55:59.800]  know what did i see just the other six percent of americans say they fully trust the media
[02:55:59.800 --> 02:56:03.320]  and i guess they probably all work for that's good news the only thing more popular than the
[02:56:03.320 --> 02:56:08.440]  government with a nine percent gallup was the media at six exactly and there's another poll too
[02:56:08.440 --> 02:56:13.480]  the media is the government i mean the media is connected to the government just as surely as pravda
[02:56:13.480 --> 02:56:19.000]  and uh nazi papers and communist papers all over the world were connected to their governments so
[02:56:19.000 --> 02:56:23.480]  they've really only collapsed and to be independent but of course they're not they've already collapsed
[02:56:23.480 --> 02:56:27.480]  they just don't seem to know it yet like zombies thank you kevin let's talk to john and texas
[02:56:27.480 --> 02:56:34.920]  you're on the air with lou rockwell lou rockwell dot com hi elix go ahead brother the communist goals
[02:56:34.920 --> 02:56:39.400]  which is part of the congressional record right at the top of the communist goals it says promote
[02:56:39.400 --> 02:56:44.440]  free trade and in fact all of our manufacturing jobs went over there that evil communist police
[02:56:44.440 --> 02:56:49.880]  state in china to build them up into the first class superpower is the greatest act of treason
[02:56:49.880 --> 02:56:53.720]  and servant under this country but that's not real free trade i mean when china has a 35
[02:56:53.720 --> 02:56:58.440]  percent economic currency tariff on us it's not free trade when they don't have the same standards
[02:56:58.440 --> 02:57:02.840]  as we do they put them on us that's not free trade so people get confused by this and think well
[02:57:02.840 --> 02:57:07.800]  then why is alex jones and ron paul lou rockwell for free i'm for open trade as long as it's a good
[02:57:07.800 --> 02:57:13.160]  deal uh well what's your specific point john will let lou rockwell respond here in closing
[02:57:13.160 --> 02:57:18.440]  well i just thought that was one of the big acts of treason the fact that the free trade agreement
[02:57:18.440 --> 02:57:22.680]  was used to arm up china into a first-rate superpower and one-sided deal though wasn't a
[02:57:22.680 --> 02:57:26.840]  fair trade absolutely it was a one-sided deal and i mean what would you say about that how
[02:57:26.840 --> 02:57:30.600]  do you gauge that i would say by the way just i might make the point that china's military
[02:57:30.600 --> 02:57:37.720]  budget is less than 10 of the us's so it's not it's it's not a first-class superpower uh it's
[02:57:37.720 --> 02:57:43.000]  just another thing they're wanting to gin up they want a war with russia and china hillary has talked
[02:57:43.000 --> 02:57:48.920]  about this cruise oh yeah china is teetering on the verge of total collapse it would like a world war
[02:57:48.920 --> 02:57:54.120]  so what is free trade i do believe in free trade although you know just like george hw bush and
[02:57:54.120 --> 02:57:59.480]  george w bush and obama talk about freedom they mean of course anti-freedom uh they talk about
[02:57:59.480 --> 02:58:04.440]  free trade they mean anti-free trade what is free trade means if i'm a businessman i can sell my
[02:58:04.440 --> 02:58:09.480]  goods to somebody in germany or china or mexico or any other place and i can buy from there
[02:58:09.480 --> 02:58:14.440]  without the government interfering it doesn't mean these managed trade treaties that are designed
[02:58:14.440 --> 02:58:21.160]  to like nafta to benefit the crony 14 000 pages long that's not free it's a screw job i actually
[02:58:21.160 --> 02:58:25.720]  looked through nafta i spent a whole day the terrible time about wasting a day going through
[02:58:25.720 --> 02:58:30.120]  the nafta treaty and of course it was just full of how they're going to benefit caterpillar or
[02:58:30.120 --> 02:58:33.880]  westinghouse or blue this is too important do five more i know you got to go but we're back in 70
[02:58:33.880 --> 02:58:38.760]  seconds do five more with us finish up on a guy when he was in congress dug through nafta literally

[02:59:18.520 --> 02:59:24.360]  supplements brain force uses natural brain activation ingredients like gerba mate extract alpha gpc
[02:59:24.360 --> 02:59:31.480]  elphianine hypozine a phosphatidylserine b12 and many others major nutraceutical review sites rave

[03:00:40.520 --> 03:00:45.160]  with that you know why not just go ahead and cancel elections foreign groups write some multi
[03:00:45.160 --> 03:00:50.520]  thousand page piece of garbage 200 pages of summary and then we can't see it till it's already globally
[03:00:50.520 --> 03:00:55.960]  passed and then ted cruz votes to fast track it but claims he's against it when his wife helped
[03:00:55.960 --> 03:01:00.680]  write it if i'm ashamed of anything we rock well it's this i've been neutral on ted cruz because
[03:01:00.680 --> 03:01:07.400]  of how he was acting in the senate on a few issues but man if he isn't a bush rock a fellers sleeper cell
[03:01:07.400 --> 03:01:18.120]  nobody is texas he was the solicitor general of the bush of george h george w bush uh then he got a job
[03:01:18.120 --> 03:01:22.200]  through the bush administration at the federal trade commission the federal the federal bush
[03:01:22.200 --> 03:01:27.880]  administration is versus the state bush administration uh he and his wife are heralded as the first
[03:01:27.880 --> 03:01:33.640]  bush campaign marriage that they were both working for george w bush and they got married
[03:01:33.640 --> 03:01:40.440]  and uh these these people and a christians a total busher and uh this is the fourth fourth term
[03:01:41.480 --> 03:01:47.880]  yeah well i mean cruz cruz is uh the cruz is a very bad guy it's not a coincidence he looks like a
[03:01:47.880 --> 03:01:54.520]  vampire well they say he's completely hateful and cold and person but acts all nice on the surface
[03:01:54.520 --> 03:01:58.440]  well all he needs is a set of fangs and we'll know who he is
[03:01:59.880 --> 03:02:04.680]  lou rockwell getting back to nafta and the thousands of pages of that and other key tidbits we really
[03:02:04.680 --> 03:02:09.720]  appreciate your time well it's you know i as i mentioned i i actually went through the whole
[03:02:09.720 --> 03:02:15.320]  nafta you as you say we we're not allowed to look through the tpp agreement uh but uh i look through
[03:02:15.320 --> 03:02:20.280]  the in those days certainly freer days i was able to look through the whole thing and it consisted
[03:02:20.280 --> 03:02:26.600]  of nothing but special deals just as you might expect special crony deals um they didn't mean
[03:02:26.600 --> 03:02:31.960]  for example here's free trade with mexico i can drive my car to mexico fill it up with goods
[03:02:31.960 --> 03:02:36.840]  bring it back and wave at the border guards on the way in that's free trade because that's not
[03:02:36.840 --> 03:02:43.160]  what's allowed everything has to be operated through the crony banks through the crony companies

[03:03:57.480 --> 03:04:01.880]  lives but we know nothing about them they're more secretive than ever as rumpal always says
[03:04:01.880 --> 03:04:05.160]  there should be the opposite should be total transparency for the government let's have
[03:04:05.160 --> 03:04:09.960]  a camera in the white house and so forth but we should have no transparency whatsoever except
[03:04:09.960 --> 03:04:15.480]  what we voluntarily give up so we should have total privacy they total transparency of course
[03:04:15.480 --> 03:04:21.160]  it's uh just the opposite privacy is our greatest asset we're naked before them they're able to

[03:04:54.040 --> 03:05:00.600]  watson from her botanic majesties all beyond straight ahead today is monday april 18th and
[03:05:00.600 --> 03:05:04.200]  here's some of the latest news it's now known that the color out lawmakers who voted to scrap
[03:05:04.200 --> 03:05:08.120]  the state primary are in fact had cruised elegance four state republicans voted against the bill that
[03:05:08.120 --> 03:05:11.960]  would allow colorado voters to chance to vote in a presidential primary and all of them are
[03:05:11.960 --> 03:05:16.200]  cruise supporters with three of them listed as members of cruises colorado leadership team and
[03:05:16.200 --> 03:05:20.680]  one of them senator kevin grantham even had the audacity to brag about cruises quote victory on
[03:05:20.680 --> 03:05:24.680]  twitter despite the fact that the voters did not get to pick a candidate in other news only six
[03:05:24.680 --> 03:05:28.760]  percent of people trust the mainstream media putting the industry about equal to congress and
[03:05:28.760 --> 03:05:33.320]  well below the public's view of other organizations this lack of confidence in establishment media
[03:05:33.320 --> 03:05:37.560]  is fueled by an accurate season reporting and deceptive bias another study revealed that only
[03:05:37.560 --> 03:05:42.440]  45 of americans over 77 million will not pay an income tax this year because they have no
[03:05:42.440 --> 03:05:46.680]  taxable income or they receive enough tax breaks or raise their liability this says a lot about
[03:05:46.680 --> 03:05:51.480]  the current decline of the economy you'd expect less tax revenue as more americans leave the job

[03:08:44.120 --> 03:08:51.080]  watson and while americans are still talking about colby bryant the elite are preparing for
[03:08:51.080 --> 03:08:57.720]  complete bedlam and mayhem of course we had the report last week surrounding the company that's
[03:08:57.720 --> 03:09:05.640]  building luxury underground bunkers for the ultra wealthy to quote protect high net worth individuals
[03:09:05.640 --> 03:09:11.640]  from the general public that's you and me does that mean that you know mass civil unrest is
[03:09:11.640 --> 03:09:17.640]  going to happen next week next month even next year no but it tells us that the elite are preparing
[03:09:17.640 --> 03:09:23.800]  for something big they see this global political awakening that's a big new brzezinski talked about
[03:09:23.800 --> 03:09:30.120]  years ago they see it going hot they see it going violent all around the world and even in the west
[03:09:30.120 --> 03:09:36.680]  which is why you know as of last year we had the news story about the elite buying strips of land
[03:09:36.680 --> 03:09:44.040]  remote property in new zealand that came out of the davos economic forum last january january 2015
[03:09:45.240 --> 03:09:50.120]  and members of the elite were a lot were asked why they were doing this and they said basically
[03:09:50.120 --> 03:09:57.160]  well we're afraid of ferguson style riots and mass civil unrest arising in the west and of course
[03:09:57.160 --> 03:10:03.720]  with this rising wealth inequality it makes that kind of social disorder more likely so we've got
[03:10:03.720 --> 03:10:11.400]  this huge story which just went up on info wars dot com about an hour ago top insurer warns global
[03:10:11.400 --> 03:10:18.680]  civil unrest could go viral that's not alex jones saying that that's not me saying that it's loins
[03:10:18.680 --> 03:10:24.840]  one of the biggest insurers in the world warning that quote pandemic of global civil unrest could
[03:10:24.840 --> 03:10:32.520]  go viral threatening international stability this is a report that's being sent out to the mega
[03:10:32.520 --> 03:10:39.160]  wealthy just come out today it was commissioned uh they loins commissioned leading risk management
[03:10:39.160 --> 03:10:44.360]  consultancy the risk advisory group to produce a report analyzing what factors could prompt the
[03:10:44.360 --> 03:10:51.480]  spread of civil unrest around the world the report found that quote instances of political violence
[03:10:51.480 --> 03:10:57.400]  contagion are becoming more frequent and the contagion effects ever more rapid and powerful
[03:10:58.040 --> 03:11:03.560]  with the head of exposure management and reinsurance trevor maynard warning that global
[03:11:03.560 --> 03:11:09.880]  outbreaks of violence are increasingly likely to develop into quote pandemics that's their word
[03:11:09.880 --> 03:11:17.000]  pandemics of civil unrest they're talking about a transformation which will lead to quote widespread
[03:11:17.000 --> 03:11:24.520]  disruption yet prove extremely difficult to anticipate so this is going to go global they
[03:11:24.520 --> 03:11:29.640]  talk about jihadists in the middle east they talk about the arab spring and they kind of tie the two
[03:11:29.640 --> 03:11:36.920]  together of course we've also had reports about crack us troops being repositioned in major cities
[03:11:36.920 --> 03:11:44.680]  cities around the world for this very express purpose to deal with mass civil unrest we already
[03:11:44.680 --> 03:11:50.680]  see it happening in places like brazil we've seen it in japan hong kong over the past couple of years
[03:11:51.240 --> 03:11:57.400]  and of course we're seeing it in europe we're seeing warnings of civil war from the head of the swiss
[03:11:57.400 --> 03:12:03.320]  army the head of the norwegian police people in prominent people in sweden prominent security
[03:12:03.320 --> 03:12:10.280]  experts in germany and france warning those national governments that this migrant crisis which
[03:12:10.280 --> 03:12:17.480]  has been created by the elite their policies led to it will lead to a clash of civilizations whether
[03:12:17.480 --> 03:12:22.840]  that turns out to be you know some holocaust remains to be seen obviously that's very unlikely but
[03:12:22.840 --> 03:12:29.320]  they say the middle class as a result of being censored and lectured all day about being racist
[03:12:29.320 --> 03:12:36.040]  racist if they so much as criticize this migrant issue is becoming quote radicalized and that's
[03:12:36.040 --> 03:12:41.240]  going to lead to a clash with these millions of migrants they're bringing in who are already
[03:12:41.240 --> 03:12:48.120]  rioting with each other as we will get on too shortly but this is a huge report again loids one
[03:12:48.120 --> 03:12:53.640]  of the top insurers in the world is saying that nobody has adequately prepared for this mass civil
[03:12:53.640 --> 03:12:59.240]  unrest that's coming we've had the story about the elite buying bunkers again it doesn't mean
[03:12:59.240 --> 03:13:05.400]  that absolute mayhem is going to happen tomorrow but they again cite the reason why they're buying
[03:13:05.400 --> 03:13:12.920]  these you know luxury survival bunkers is not only civil unrest the prospect for social disorder
[03:13:12.920 --> 03:13:19.080]  but also natural disasters we see what's going on in japan where there's been a spate of earthquakes
[03:13:19.080 --> 03:13:25.320]  also an earthquake in ecuador and people genuinely worried about what could happen next in terms of
[03:13:25.320 --> 03:13:32.280]  natural disasters and that is another reason cited as to why the elite are buying these secure
[03:13:32.280 --> 03:13:40.680]  underground luxury bunkers in safe locations away from these potential disaster zones so again the
[03:13:40.680 --> 03:13:46.040]  elite are getting prepared whenever you know preppers are in the news whenever national
[03:13:46.040 --> 03:13:53.400]  geographic does a series about preppers they're ridiculed they're lambasted as kooks as freaks
[03:13:53.400 --> 03:14:00.760]  and yet we have the global elite the mega rich doing exactly the same thing but on an even bigger
[03:14:00.760 --> 03:14:07.160]  level i mean they're talking about you know 4 000 square foot underground luxury apartments
[03:14:07.960 --> 03:14:16.520]  but you know bobber in idaho is the kook for having his little 12 foot by 10 foot bomb shelter so
[03:14:16.520 --> 03:14:20.840]  again this whole narrative that preppers are insane they're crazy they're paranoid and yet the elite
[03:14:20.840 --> 03:14:28.200]  is doing the exact same thing only on a bigger level so this is a huge report get this article
[03:14:28.200 --> 03:14:34.200]  out share it of course it ties in with the report we had last week out of the chicago tribune which
[03:14:34.200 --> 03:14:40.600]  was about how millionaires were fleeing the city of chicago again in line with what's happening
[03:14:40.600 --> 03:14:47.720]  in major cities in europe paris and roam are also seeing a mass exodus of millionaires we have
[03:14:47.720 --> 03:14:53.720]  wealthy elites in new york city in other major american cities installing panic rooms into
[03:14:53.720 --> 03:15:00.840]  their big city apartments because again they fear civil unrest they fear race riots which
[03:15:00.840 --> 03:15:07.800]  have been exacerbated by these violent radical leftists like black lives matter buying land
[03:15:07.800 --> 03:15:13.080]  strips buying remote houses in new zealand whether it's going to happen or not they're going to be
[03:15:13.080 --> 03:15:19.960]  prepared for it so if anyone lectures you about how paranoid and kooky you are about buying you know
[03:15:19.960 --> 03:15:26.840]  three six months worth of storable food just in case then throw this back in their face
[03:15:27.480 --> 03:15:33.160]  the global mega rich are preparing for this they're spending tens of millions of dollars
[03:15:33.160 --> 03:15:38.840]  i mean the elite in london where i live have stopped buying high-end luxury properties they're
[03:15:38.840 --> 03:15:45.560]  down in some areas 33 percent over the past couple of years all the mega rich in london and other
[03:15:45.560 --> 03:15:51.480]  european cities are going back to renting because again they're getting an inkling of this global
[03:15:51.480 --> 03:15:57.480]  economic collapse this second downturn that's just around the corner so they're making financial
[03:15:57.480 --> 03:16:03.000]  moves they're making practical moves to prepare for this again while the general public is laughed
[03:16:03.000 --> 03:16:08.920]  at for having three months worth of storable food and a water filter now let's look at what's
[03:16:08.920 --> 03:16:14.840]  happening in belgium of course we had the brussels attacks back a few weeks ago this is out of our
[03:16:14.840 --> 03:16:23.960]  tea many danced after attacks muslim integration failure caused cancer that's not tommy robinson
[03:16:23.960 --> 03:16:28.920]  saying that that's not poor joseph watson saying that it's not stefan molyneux saying that that's
[03:16:28.920 --> 03:16:35.800]  the belgian interior minister belgium's integration policy has caused a cancer within muslim communities
[03:16:36.440 --> 03:16:42.520]  many of whom quote danced after the deadly brussels attacks last month said the belgian
[03:16:42.520 --> 03:16:49.000]  interior minister blaming the government for failing to integrate migrants into society now
[03:16:49.000 --> 03:16:54.920]  we go back to the isis manifesto from a few months ago where they said we're going to exploit this
[03:16:54.920 --> 03:17:03.480]  refugee wave to infiltrate migrants create more of these radicalized ghettos arm them and use them
[03:17:03.480 --> 03:17:09.720]  as sleeper cells to carry out further terror attacks in europe of course we had the raid on abdeslam
[03:17:09.720 --> 03:17:17.000]  one of the uh assailants involved in the paris massacre how was he able to hide away in mollambique
[03:17:17.000 --> 03:17:24.120]  for a period of over three months because he was supported by a network of friends and neighbors
[03:17:24.120 --> 03:17:31.560]  who advocated his goals after he'd been involved in the massacre of over 200 people in paris
[03:17:31.560 --> 03:17:38.680]  after he had been involved in plotting the brussels massacre again this is a network of islamists
[03:17:38.680 --> 03:17:45.640]  that surround the ghettos so no it's not a tiny proportion of muslims who are the problem it's
[03:17:45.640 --> 03:17:52.120]  a significant percentage as we saw with the poll last week which caused a lot of controversy in the
[03:17:52.120 --> 03:17:57.880]  uk there was a program on channel four called what muslims really think and again it simply
[03:17:57.880 --> 03:18:04.040]  restated the facts that i've stated over and over again that many of them in some cases the majority
[03:18:04.040 --> 03:18:09.880]  have completely intolerant beliefs that are incompatible with western secular liberal societies
[03:18:10.760 --> 03:18:17.640]  and now that has manifested itself in belgium with them actually celebrating dancing on the streets
[03:18:17.640 --> 03:18:24.920]  people being blown apart limbs being scattered everywhere in belgium in brussels airport in
[03:18:24.920 --> 03:18:32.360]  the metro station you know dozens of people dead dozens more injured belgium muslims were on the
[03:18:32.360 --> 03:18:38.680]  street celebrating you had children in classrooms celebrating just like after 9 11 even though the
[03:18:38.680 --> 03:18:44.040]  media called it a conspiracy theory when trump brought it up there were people there were muslims
[03:18:44.040 --> 03:18:51.480]  in new jersey celebrating 9 11 multiple anecdotal reports we had people on the radio the same day
[03:18:51.480 --> 03:18:56.360]  saying they drove past muslim areas saw them high fiving saw them celebrating
[03:18:57.560 --> 03:19:03.240]  trump mentions it and the media claims it's a huge conspiracy theory even though it was documented
[03:19:03.240 --> 03:19:08.600]  at the time and then subsequently more people came out and said that yes they saw the same thing
[03:19:08.600 --> 03:19:14.840]  in an interview with a belgium newspaper jan jan bond said that he regretted that a significant

[03:24:18.600 --> 03:24:23.880]  we are back for the election for power overdrive and the belgium interior minister has said that
[03:24:23.880 --> 03:24:31.000]  blindingly obvious that muslim migrants on integrating into society forget the millions of
[03:24:31.000 --> 03:24:37.800]  new arrivals these are people who have been there for years and years they were dancing on the streets
[03:24:37.800 --> 03:24:44.360]  when the brussels attack happened they were pelting the police with bottles and stones
[03:24:44.360 --> 03:24:49.720]  when they tried to arrest one of the individuals abdeslam who was involved in the paris massacre
[03:24:49.720 --> 03:24:56.200]  okay it's not a tiny fringe minority this is a huge problem and it's not a problem
[03:24:57.080 --> 03:25:01.160]  that europe has with people coming in from other backgrounds you know there's a lot of
[03:25:01.160 --> 03:25:06.680]  Sikhs in the united kingdom there's a lot of hindu people we don't have these this kind of problem
[03:25:06.680 --> 03:25:12.040]  we don't have no go areas where hindus and Sikhs are pelting the police with bottles
[03:25:12.840 --> 03:25:17.960]  you know firefighters who try to put out fires they get in attack this is happening in France
[03:25:17.960 --> 03:25:22.360]  it's happening in sweden they call it a conspiracy theory and yet the riots keep on happening
[03:25:23.000 --> 03:25:28.360]  in fact we had another one back at the end of last week shocking video shows hundreds of
[03:25:28.360 --> 03:25:34.520]  migrants brawling at paris metro station two people have been seriously injured and a historic
[03:25:34.520 --> 03:25:39.880]  paris metro station trashed after two massive brawls are up to between hundreds of migrants
[03:25:39.880 --> 03:25:45.320]  on thursday night and you can go and watch the video it's in the article again this is not the
[03:25:45.320 --> 03:25:50.600]  first time it's happened it happens all the time at these migrant camps throughout europe
[03:25:51.160 --> 03:25:57.880]  and in many cases the police now it's so common that they just refuse to go there you have migrants
[03:25:57.880 --> 03:26:04.040]  raping young muslim girls you have migrants killing their own wives and this is before they've even
[03:26:04.040 --> 03:26:10.120]  been let loose into the general society this is what they do amongst each other it's clearly not
[03:26:10.120 --> 03:26:17.000]  working dancing in the streets after the brussels attacks you know i've talked about the statistics
[03:26:17.000 --> 03:26:24.680]  before just in belgium belgium six percent muslim population the prison population of belgium is
[03:26:24.680 --> 03:26:31.960]  45 percent muslim that's how much that over represented in terms of criminal behavior
[03:26:31.960 --> 03:26:38.280]  you can look at the welfare state again you know six seven eight percent muslims in sweden
[03:26:38.280 --> 03:26:45.560]  yet foreign immigrants represent the majority of welfare payments so this crap they trot out again
[03:26:45.560 --> 03:26:51.400]  and again that we need these waves of migrants to do jobs because you know we're dying out we need
[03:26:51.400 --> 03:26:59.800]  this input of labor simply not true the majority of them go on welfare 800 million muslims are
[03:26:59.800 --> 03:27:05.240]  illiterate they can't even get to grips with their own language how are they going to get to grips
[03:27:05.240 --> 03:27:10.280]  with ours how are they going to assimilate so we see more and more of this social unrest these
[03:27:10.280 --> 03:27:18.040]  riots taking place then we have this article finished migrants posed with preteen girlfriends on
[03:27:18.040 --> 03:27:25.400]  social media oh another wonderful piece of cultural enrichment images surfaced on the finished image
[03:27:25.400 --> 03:27:31.720]  board lia luta of finished migrants and their preteen white girlfriends posing on instagram
[03:27:31.720 --> 03:27:39.720]  and facebook in the finished city of sarjavi the men of arab descent in their 20s to 40s are
[03:27:39.720 --> 03:27:47.000]  seen posing with the young girls with captions such as beautiful my baby and i love you and again
[03:27:47.000 --> 03:27:54.920]  bearing in mind that these people follow a religion in which muhammad married a nine-year-old
[03:27:54.920 --> 03:27:59.560]  girl married a six-year-old girl concentrated the marriage when she was nine this is the background
[03:27:59.560 --> 03:28:05.240]  they come from we have the mass rape in cologne several other major european cities we have children
[03:28:05.240 --> 03:28:12.120]  being attacked in these migrant camps and now they're posing on social media with preteen girlfriends
[03:28:12.120 --> 03:28:19.720]  men as old as 40 and what's most shocking about this is that they asked the parents what the hell
[03:28:19.720 --> 03:28:27.720]  was going on the parents of these preteen finish girls posing with arab migrants who said they
[03:28:27.720 --> 03:28:32.440]  were their girlfriends they went and asked the parents what was going on and they basically said
[03:28:32.440 --> 03:28:38.360]  oh they're just friends it's no big deal some 40 year old guys hanging out with your 11 year old
[03:28:38.360 --> 03:28:46.680]  daughter calling her my baby and it's no big deal these people are seriously deranged i mean if
[03:28:46.680 --> 03:28:53.320]  ever there's a need for child protective services then this is it meanwhile you know they take away
[03:28:53.320 --> 03:29:00.120]  children from loving foster homes just because the foster parents supported ukip a political party
[03:29:00.120 --> 03:29:07.720]  that was anti-immigration but it's perfectly fine to have your preteen daughter posing on social media
[03:29:07.720 --> 03:29:14.760]  with 40 year old arab men who call them my baby i mean how frigging sick is that and the parents
[03:29:14.760 --> 03:29:21.800]  are just like well god forbid someone might call us racist it's perfectly fine that some weird 40
[03:29:21.800 --> 03:29:25.800]  year old man who can barely speak english you know being in the country a few months he's hanging out
[03:29:25.800 --> 03:29:31.480]  with that 11 year old daughter i mean i've never seen something this shocking this is in this is in
[03:29:31.480 --> 03:29:38.840]  finland it's also happening in austria absolutely despicable we'll get more into this after the
[03:29:38.840 --> 03:29:44.280]  break we're also going to talk about the latest controversy with the north carolina bathroom
[03:29:44.280 --> 03:29:53.400]  bill we'll be right back keep it locked in we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and
[03:29:53.400 --> 03:30:02.520]  the gcn radio network today is monday april 18th and here's some of the latest news it's now known
[03:30:02.520 --> 03:30:06.680]  that the colorado lawmakers who voted to scrap the state primary in fact had cruised elegance four
[03:30:06.680 --> 03:30:10.360]  state republicans voted against the bill that would allow colorado voters to chance to vote in a
[03:30:10.360 --> 03:30:14.280]  presidential primary and all of them are cruise supporters with three of them listed as members
[03:30:14.280 --> 03:30:18.760]  of cruises colorado leadership team and one of them senator kevin grantham even had the
[03:30:18.760 --> 03:30:22.600]  audacity to brag about cruises quote victory on twitter despite the fact that the voters did not
[03:30:22.600 --> 03:30:26.920]  get to pick a candidate in other news only six percent of people trust the mainstream media
[03:30:26.920 --> 03:30:30.520]  putting the industry about equal to congress and well below the public's view of other
[03:30:30.520 --> 03:30:34.600]  organizations this lack of confidence in establishment media is fueled by an accurate
[03:30:34.600 --> 03:30:39.960]  season reporting and deceptive bias another study revealed that only 45 percent of americans over 77
[03:30:39.960 --> 03:30:43.800]  million will not pay an income tax this year because they have no taxable income or they
[03:30:43.800 --> 03:30:47.880]  receive enough tax breaks or raise their liability this has a lot about the current decline of the
[03:30:47.880 --> 03:30:53.320]  economy you'd expect less tax revenue as more americans leave the job market or stay underemployed

[03:33:19.320 --> 03:33:35.400]  from the front lines of the info war. Now of course liberals continue to freak out over these
[03:33:35.400 --> 03:33:41.400]  bathroom bills that are either in the process of passing or have passed in several states and of
[03:33:41.400 --> 03:33:49.640]  course the main battlefront is north carolina they passed a bill called hb2 which would god forbid
[03:33:49.640 --> 03:33:55.640]  require people to use public bathrooms that correspond with the gender they were born now
[03:33:55.640 --> 03:34:02.520]  this was a reaction it was a defensive measure against an ordinance in charlotte which would have
[03:34:02.520 --> 03:34:10.200]  forced private businesses to cater for transgender people and allow them to use whichever bathroom
[03:34:10.200 --> 03:34:17.560]  they like depending on which gender they identify on that particular day so this was a complete
[03:34:17.560 --> 03:34:23.560]  violation of the rights of private businesses similar to what we've seen with christian bakeries
[03:34:23.560 --> 03:34:30.120]  of course we've had gay activists go out and try and ruin people's lives this was this was a vindictive
[03:34:30.120 --> 03:34:37.800]  measure it wasn't a random occurrence in several examples where they go to a christian bakery ask
[03:34:37.800 --> 03:34:44.760]  for a gay wedding cake and they're refused because the owners say sorry that doesn't accord with our
[03:34:44.760 --> 03:34:50.760]  beliefs we politely reject you know we suggest you go somewhere else of course steven crowded
[03:34:50.760 --> 03:34:57.480]  did that in michigan he went to a bunch of muslim owned bakeries and asked for a gay wedding cake
[03:34:58.040 --> 03:35:04.520]  they refused but there was no national hounding campaign there was no national scandal surrounding
[03:35:04.520 --> 03:35:11.080]  that so again it's one rule for one set of people and another rule for another set of people
[03:35:11.080 --> 03:35:16.760]  so they passed this bill in north carolina there are similar bills in other states and all it said
[03:35:16.760 --> 03:35:22.280]  was in public bathrooms you have to use the bathroom which corresponds with your biological
[03:35:22.280 --> 03:35:29.000]  gender which is on your birth certificate they said if you're a private business feel completely
[03:35:29.000 --> 03:35:36.680]  free to provide transgender bathrooms or to allow transgender identifying people to use whichever
[03:35:36.680 --> 03:35:44.280]  bathroom they choose so in a sense it was a defense of rights in terms of the majority
[03:35:44.280 --> 03:35:50.120]  whereas the charlotte ordinance was a violation of people's rights to cater for a minority
[03:35:50.120 --> 03:35:59.720]  bearing in mind zero point zero three percent of the u.s population identifies as transgender a tiny
[03:35:59.720 --> 03:36:06.280]  minority and the point i made in a video that i put out about this is if you make the effort to
[03:36:06.280 --> 03:36:10.760]  look if you're a man and you want to be a woman and you make the effort to look like a woman
[03:36:10.760 --> 03:36:17.080]  then nobody is even going to notice if you use the female bathroom of course what this will do
[03:36:17.080 --> 03:36:23.080]  and it's already had this effect in several cases which i talk about in the video it basically
[03:36:23.080 --> 03:36:29.080]  it's a loophole to allow perverts and freaks to go into women's bathrooms and i'm not just saying
[03:36:29.080 --> 03:36:35.160]  that for effect it already happened in seattle back a couple of months ago there was a man who
[03:36:35.160 --> 03:36:40.680]  quote made no verbal or physical attempt to identify as a woman you know he didn't even make the
[03:36:40.680 --> 03:36:48.280]  effort to put on a wig he walked into a female bathroom in seattle and began to undress as a
[03:36:48.280 --> 03:36:56.280]  man he didn't even look like a woman but again he cited the law quote the law has changed and i
[03:36:56.280 --> 03:37:02.520]  have a right to be here that's what this hairy creep said as he walked into a women's bathroom and
[03:37:02.520 --> 03:37:08.120]  began to undress so again this is what this kind of ordinance that we saw in charlotte is going to
[03:37:08.120 --> 03:37:15.720]  to make more likely it's basically a red carpet for perverts and pedophiles you had the case in
[03:37:15.720 --> 03:37:23.640]  colorado where teen girls complained about a quote transgender student who kept entering the girls
[03:37:23.640 --> 03:37:31.560]  changing room they were threatened with hate crimes charges for doing so so again violating the
[03:37:31.560 --> 03:37:37.480]  privacy rights violating the private business rights the private religious rights of people
[03:37:37.480 --> 03:37:47.400]  the majority to cater for this tiny tiny minority 0.03 percent of the population you know people
[03:37:47.400 --> 03:37:53.480]  like the the guy who we featured a few months ago who left his wife and family to become a woman
[03:37:53.480 --> 03:38:00.440]  and now now identifies as a six-year-old girl and he's in the clip you can go and watch the video
[03:38:00.440 --> 03:38:06.840]  you know if he identifies as a six-year-old girl shouldn't he be allowed to use the children's
[03:38:06.840 --> 03:38:14.840]  playground shouldn't he be allowed to use the children's locker room you know a 55-year-old guy
[03:38:14.840 --> 03:38:20.520]  with a beard doesn't really look much like a woman but he identifies as a woman and he also
[03:38:20.520 --> 03:38:26.600]  identifies as a six-year-old child so are you committing hate speech are you violating his
[03:38:26.600 --> 03:38:34.440]  rights by saying that he as a biological 55-year-old man shouldn't be allowed to go into a children's
[03:38:34.440 --> 03:38:41.000]  locker room this is the abuse that this is opening up the potential for it but it's no surprise you
[03:38:41.000 --> 03:38:49.000]  know given that the left is now beginning to hail as we predicted all along pedophilia as an
[03:38:49.000 --> 03:38:57.400]  alternative sexual lifestyle choice they're actually giving pedophiles platforms on salon.com
[03:38:57.400 --> 03:39:03.480]  to argue that they're just victims of right-wing bigotry and that their sexual preference
[03:39:03.480 --> 03:39:10.280]  should just be accepted in the same way that being gay is accepted so it's no surprise
[03:39:10.280 --> 03:39:17.960]  that the left is really again laying down the red carpet for pedophiles for perverts to abuse this
[03:39:17.960 --> 03:39:24.920]  kind of situation and then you have of course the virtue signaling on steroids that's taking place
[03:39:24.920 --> 03:39:31.880]  you had Ringo Starr cancel a gig in North Carolina to protest against this bathroom bill
[03:39:31.880 --> 03:39:38.440]  now he didn't cancel a gig in Russia where they actually arrest gay people for protesting on
[03:39:38.440 --> 03:39:46.440]  the streets oh no only in North Carolina you had PayPal come out and say they were withdrawing plans
[03:39:46.440 --> 03:39:53.960]  for an operation centering North Carolina that would have employed 400 people with the justification
[03:39:53.960 --> 03:40:02.280]  quote this is from the CEO PayPal's Dan Shulman the new law perpetuates discrimination and it
[03:40:02.280 --> 03:40:08.280]  violates the values and principles that are at the core of PayPal's mission and culture that's what
[03:40:08.280 --> 03:40:14.600]  they said when they decided to pull this 400 people operations unit in North Carolina to protest
[03:40:14.600 --> 03:40:21.880]  against this bathroom bill again citing their values and principles those values and principles
[03:40:21.880 --> 03:40:29.640]  don't get in the way of PayPal doing business in Saudi Arabia a country that beheads homosexuals the
[03:40:29.640 --> 03:40:33.640]  virtue signaling kind of disappears when it comes to Middle Eastern countries of course
[03:40:34.360 --> 03:40:41.480]  because they can do no wrong you had Coca-Cola Starbucks Microsoft Google all signing this
[03:40:41.480 --> 03:40:49.880]  letter decrying the North Carolina bill yet they all do business in Q8 where cross-dressing
[03:40:49.880 --> 03:40:57.240]  is punishable by up to 10 years in prison they didn't sign off on a letter condemning Q8
[03:40:57.960 --> 03:41:03.400]  no they only signed off on a letter condemning North Carolina because again god forbid people
[03:41:03.400 --> 03:41:09.720]  will have to use the bathroom that correlates with their biological gender Cirque du Soleil
[03:41:10.280 --> 03:41:16.360]  they've cancelled shows in North Carolina over this bathroom bill they haven't cancelled shows in
[03:41:16.360 --> 03:41:24.280]  Dubai where being transgender is illegal where people go to prison for this but again there's no
[03:41:24.280 --> 03:41:30.360]  virtue signaling when it comes to Dubai because of course that's a vastly more lucrative market
[03:41:31.720 --> 03:41:37.640]  these companies have no principles whatsoever this is all about virtue signaling but I go back
[03:41:37.640 --> 03:41:43.160]  to the point this is nothing to do with human rights this was a defensive measure against an
[03:41:43.160 --> 03:41:47.560]  ordinance which if it would have you know taken effect and become a pretext for the rest of the
[03:41:47.560 --> 03:41:54.200]  state would have forced private businesses to adhere to this rule of allowing people who
[03:41:54.200 --> 03:42:00.840]  identify as transgender to use whichever bathroom they liked now I don't care if you identify as
[03:42:00.840 --> 03:42:07.640]  Barney the purple dinosaur but when government conspires to violate the rights of the majority
[03:42:07.640 --> 03:42:15.080]  to be politically correct and please a tiny minority that's a huge problem you don't let
[03:42:15.080 --> 03:42:21.720]  people who identify as six-year-old girls when they're 55 year old men use children's changing
[03:42:21.720 --> 03:42:28.680]  rooms so why should you allow people who maybe on a whim identify as being female female even though
[03:42:28.680 --> 03:42:34.360]  they're male use the female locker room now we're going to go to this video which ties into this
[03:42:34.360 --> 03:42:42.360]  this is by youtuber joey salads who we featured on info wars.com before he does these social
[03:42:42.360 --> 03:42:48.840]  experiments where he puts these you know liberal sacred cows to the test he did one a couple of
[03:42:48.840 --> 03:42:54.440]  weeks ago where he went out and tried to ascertain who was the most violent Trump supporters or
[03:42:54.440 --> 03:42:59.160]  Bernie Sanders supporters of course he ended up getting physically attacked by Bernie Sanders
[03:42:59.160 --> 03:43:04.680]  supporters because they're vile intolerant hateful people as our reporters have proven over and over
[03:43:04.680 --> 03:43:11.000]  again in Portland New York and other areas over the past couple of weeks so he basically went out
[03:43:11.000 --> 03:43:17.400]  and did a video testing this bathroom bill and now for you know people listening on the radio who've
[03:43:17.400 --> 03:43:24.680]  only got the audio he basically just dressed up as a woman and followed women into female bathrooms
[03:43:24.680 --> 03:43:31.720]  to get their reaction their organic natural reaction to a guy with facial hair who is
[03:43:31.720 --> 03:43:38.120]  dressed up as a woman following them into the female bathroom this is a four minute clip here it is
[03:43:39.080 --> 03:43:43.800]  what's up guys joey salads here in north Carolina passed a bill that requires trans people to use
[03:43:43.800 --> 03:43:48.040]  the bathrooms that correspond with the sex listed on their birth certificate a reset to a
[03:43:48.040 --> 03:43:52.440]  trans friend of mine and a doctor whom I'm also friends with and both had some contradicting points
[03:43:52.440 --> 03:43:57.080]  my trans friends told me that nobody is born to a sex or a gender and that gender and sex
[03:43:57.080 --> 03:44:02.200]  are a social construct and that dna and genetics have nothing to do with your sex my doctor said
[03:44:02.200 --> 03:44:07.800]  that dna and genetics have everything to do with your gender at birth you either become a male or
[03:44:07.800 --> 03:44:13.320]  a female with help of my trans friend today i'm going to dress and act like a transgender
[03:44:13.960 --> 03:44:18.360]  i'm then going to enter women's bathrooms and let's see how they react all right guys so i'm
[03:44:18.360 --> 03:44:25.000]  about to make my transformation to look like a transgender now i know that dressing up like a
[03:44:25.000 --> 03:44:30.360]  girl doesn't necessarily make me transgender it would just make me a cross dresser but on the
[03:44:30.360 --> 03:44:36.040]  outside people will still think that i'm transgender i got this information from my transgender friend
[03:44:36.040 --> 03:44:48.440]  and it is transgender approved how about look oh my god joe you look fabulous i got my transgender
[03:44:48.440 --> 03:44:58.040]  friend on the phone and i'm going to see what they think about my dress so it looks good do i have
[03:44:58.040 --> 03:45:07.800]  do i is it transgender approved all right well i also found out through the transgender community
[03:45:07.800 --> 03:45:14.280]  that some of them actually keep their voice the same way so going through the requirement checklist
[03:45:14.920 --> 03:45:21.160]  penis you're allowed to have voice you're allowed to have technically speaking i would be considered
[03:45:21.720 --> 03:45:26.360]  somebody just starting their transgender transformation let's go uh let's go into some
[03:45:26.360 --> 03:45:37.880]  girls bathrooms to see what they think what are you doing i'm transgender what no you can't be in
[03:45:37.880 --> 03:45:42.120]  here but this is a girl's bathroom i identify as a girl you're not do you hear yourself right now
[03:45:42.120 --> 03:45:48.200]  you are not a woman you have such i am a girl transgender we could we could stay with our
[03:45:48.200 --> 03:45:53.560]  regular voice what doesn't make any sense you definitely have a penis you need to come here
[03:45:53.560 --> 03:45:59.000]  i do have a penis but i identify as a girl so i'm allowed in here why not i'm a girl no you
[03:45:59.000 --> 03:46:06.280]  can't be in here but i'm a girl you can't just say you're a girl all right i'm gonna i'll get out
[03:46:06.280 --> 03:46:22.440]  i'll let you be i'm trans you're a guy get out of here but i identify as a girl why can't i be
[03:46:22.440 --> 03:46:37.800]  disgusting get the out of here usually okay okay okay okay okay hello oh hi how are you good are
[03:46:38.440 --> 03:46:44.840]  you transgender yeah yeah oh good for you thanks how long have you been transgendered for
[03:46:44.840 --> 03:46:54.840]  you just started like a couple days ago oh yeah yeah i gotta go i'm gonna go right now
[03:46:59.080 --> 03:46:59.400]  hey
[03:47:02.280 --> 03:47:08.440]  get out get out i'm transgender what are you doing in here i'm transgender i'm a girl no no no i'm a
[03:47:08.440 --> 03:47:17.880]  girl why it's not okay it's not okay i'm a girl thank you guys for watching please
[03:47:17.880 --> 03:47:22.920]  this video like share and subscribe and as you can tell from this video that most women are not
[03:47:22.920 --> 03:47:28.920]  comfortable sharing a bathroom with a trans person there has to be another solution for this debate
[03:47:28.920 --> 03:47:34.200]  because women are not comfortable sharing a bathroom and a trans people want to share the
[03:47:34.200 --> 03:47:37.960]  bathroom so there needs to be a better solution comment below what you think the solution needs
[03:47:37.960 --> 03:47:43.000]  to be do you think that trans people should be allowed to use the bathrooms on what they associate
[03:47:43.000 --> 03:47:47.240]  themselves with or do you think they need to use the bathrooms on what my doctor calls what they
[03:47:47.240 --> 03:47:55.000]  biologically associate with i'm joey salads thanks for watching tell you the truth okay and that was
[03:47:55.000 --> 03:48:03.240]  in hollywood so that's how liberal women react to transgender men going into the female bathroom
[03:48:03.240 --> 03:48:08.760]  so they're going to virtue signal about it all day in opposing this north carolina bathroom bill
[03:48:08.760 --> 03:48:15.320]  but when it's actually put to the test and a guy with a wig walks into the female bathroom
[03:48:15.320 --> 03:48:23.800]  that is how they react very telling but of course you know that's being transphobic but the christian
[03:48:23.800 --> 03:48:29.880]  bakery whose business was destroyed because it refused to make a gay wedding cake they're bad
[03:48:29.880 --> 03:48:35.000]  even though you know steven crowded went in did the same experiment with muslim bakeries
[03:48:35.000 --> 03:48:40.600]  they refused to make the cake and again nothing happened so again that video by joey salads which
[03:48:40.600 --> 03:48:47.000]  is an exclusive he gave it to us first it's going up on youtube in a moment again proves that when
[03:48:47.720 --> 03:48:53.400]  liberals react to a man walking into a woman's bathroom that's the natural organic reaction
[03:48:53.400 --> 03:48:58.840]  you're going to get and that's what's going to happen if these ordinances like the one in charlotte
[03:48:58.840 --> 03:49:07.560]  are passed so again given that evidence the north carolina bathroom bill makes perfect sense and you
[03:49:07.560 --> 03:49:14.920]  can go watch my video about it it's linked from the alex jones channel about this transgender
[03:49:14.920 --> 03:49:20.680]  bathroom controversy let's get back into some more news now of course before the previous
[03:49:20.680 --> 03:49:25.880]  segment i was talking about muslims in brussels who were dancing on the street celebrating the
[03:49:25.880 --> 03:49:31.800]  brussels attack then we have this article out of breitbart uk equalities chief who popularized the
[03:49:31.800 --> 03:49:37.720]  term islamophobia admits i never thought muslims would blend i thought muslims would blend into
[03:49:37.720 --> 03:49:42.840]  britain i should have known better and of course this is off the back of a channel four program
[03:49:42.840 --> 03:49:49.640]  which caused quite a stir here in the uk people said it was islamophobic i watched it it wasn't
[03:49:49.640 --> 03:49:56.200]  it was completely tame most of the people interviewed in the program were muslims most of the people
[03:49:56.200 --> 03:50:01.880]  speaking out about this were muslim reformists and again it revealed that muslims share a lot of
[03:50:01.880 --> 03:50:08.600]  these intolerant attitudes which are completely intolerant towards homosexuals towards transgenres
[03:50:08.600 --> 03:50:15.800]  is completely incompatible with western ideals of liberalism and that's what leads to these ghettos
[03:50:15.800 --> 03:50:22.600]  that what that's what leads to people protect protecting abdeslam the paris massacre assailant
[03:50:23.640 --> 03:50:29.640]  because again it's concentric rings it's not just jihadists it's islamists who protect this
[03:50:29.640 --> 03:50:37.160]  ideology this integration hasn't worked bringing in millions more of these people won't work it
[03:50:37.160 --> 03:50:42.680]  will only lead to mass civil unrest london preacher and friend hail fanatic who killed
[03:50:42.680 --> 03:50:49.080]  politician in pakistan as hero and martyr yet another example this guy who defended liberal
[03:50:49.080 --> 03:50:55.640]  values in pakistan was murdered and his death is being celebrated by quote moderate muslims everywhere
[03:50:55.640 --> 03:51:00.760]  will be back in the final segment this is the alex joneshow live stay tuned my name is don

[03:54:52.040 --> 03:54:59.560]  report declassified of course obama is set to visit saudi arabia tomorrow to bow and kowtow
[03:54:59.560 --> 03:55:05.880]  to the royal dictators president barack obama is facing increased pressure due to renewed effort
[03:55:05.880 --> 03:55:11.080]  to make a secret congressional report public that may describe links between saudi arabia and
[03:55:11.080 --> 03:55:17.000]  september 11 terror attacks over the past week families of 9 11 victims have criticized obama
[03:55:17.000 --> 03:55:22.360]  because of reports stating that his administration is lobbying congress to block a bill that would
[03:55:22.360 --> 03:55:28.200]  allow terror victims to sue foreign governments connected to the attacks on american soil now
[03:55:28.200 --> 03:55:35.480]  hillary clinton was also asked about that bill this is out the daily caller chock schumer's

[03:55:40.440 --> 03:55:46.600]  government clinton surprised abc's this week host george stephanopoulos on sunday when she

[03:56:08.600 --> 03:56:16.760]  interesting that hillary clinton refuses to comment on the 28 pages on saudi arabia's involvement
[03:56:16.760 --> 03:56:23.640]  with 9 11 when the clinton foundation before she was even secretary of state received
[03:56:23.640 --> 03:56:31.000]  10 million dollars from saudi arabia gee what a coincidence and then of course it was under
[03:56:31.000 --> 03:56:37.400]  hillary's state department that saudi arabia got that sweetheart deal with the fighter jets
[03:56:37.400 --> 03:56:44.920]  so again that's the reason why she's not commenting on it because she's in bed with the saudi
