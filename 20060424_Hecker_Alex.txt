[00:00:15.583 --> 00:00:20.207]  We have a modern Paul Revere on the line with us.
[00:00:20.207 --> 00:00:23.350]  An amazing lady.
[00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:24.731]  She's a doctor.
[00:00:24.731 --> 00:00:26.293]  Worked at Mount Sinai Medical Center.
[00:00:27.384 --> 00:00:29.645]  A mother of two, lives in Flushing, Queens.
[00:00:29.645 --> 00:00:35.406]  Used to be a researcher at Mount Sinai Medical Center, but now works full-time as a Falun Gong activist, friends said.
[00:00:35.406 --> 00:00:39.808]  There is no higher calling, I would add, to what she's doing.
[00:00:39.808 --> 00:00:41.488]  She was born in China, naturalized U.S.
[00:00:41.488 --> 00:00:46.050]  citizen, got to the White House grounds in the past from the Epoch Times Falun Gong newspaper.
[00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.331]  We have links to all that up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:00:50.331 --> 00:00:53.392]  I'd love to have 20 million Chinese in America like her.
[00:00:55.462 --> 00:00:57.163]  I mean, she is so American.
[00:00:57.163 --> 00:01:01.044]  She's so much more American than anybody else I see out there.
[00:01:01.044 --> 00:01:02.765]  Pathetic Americans.
[00:01:02.765 --> 00:01:17.630]  I've heard neocons on talk radio saying she deserved to go to prison, that she disrupted it, that she threatened him when her full quote, and we have it here, was simply that the Communist Chinese Party's days are numbered involving their abuse against Falun Gong and others.
[00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:23.312]  They have mobile execution vans, they advertise in major publications that they take organs, that they have good, quote, fresh organs.
[00:01:24.463 --> 00:01:31.369]  The British Medical Society, the Society of Transplantee Doctors, all of them have gone public.
[00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:32.109]  It's admitted.
[00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:35.172]  It's been in major publications.
[00:01:35.172 --> 00:01:37.654]  We have video of public executions in China.
[00:01:37.654 --> 00:01:44.179]  We have video of Tiananmen Squares that happen on average every month as they machine gun and attack and murder peaceful farmers.
[00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:47.242]  We're going to play a clip of that in a few minutes.
[00:01:47.242 --> 00:01:48.643]  It is unbelievable.
[00:01:50.111 --> 00:02:17.740]  and now they're talking about charging her with intimidating a public a foreign official months and what six months in federal prison bush had me arrested back in nineteen ninety eight fact dig up that club when i simply ask him a question at a press conference so we're becoming like the murdering communist chinese government who has killed more people than hitler and stalin almost combined there is no greater evil and uh... wang wing long joins us
[00:02:18.624 --> 00:02:20.506]  And we really appreciate her.
[00:02:20.506 --> 00:02:24.269]  The press just has her as Wang Winyai.
[00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:27.672]  But she says her full name is Wang Winyai Wong.
[00:02:27.672 --> 00:02:30.134]  And thank you so much for coming on with us, Doctor.
[00:02:30.134 --> 00:02:31.776]  Oh, thank you.
[00:02:31.776 --> 00:02:34.098]  I'm glad to be your program.
[00:02:35.308 --> 00:02:39.432]  And just because I'm one of these dumb Texans, I'm joking folks.
[00:02:39.432 --> 00:02:41.735]  Pronounce your full name properly for us.
[00:02:41.735 --> 00:02:46.119]  Last name Wong and first name Wen-Yee.
[00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:47.000]  Wen-Yee?
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.881]  Wen-Yee.
[00:02:47.881 --> 00:02:49.302]  Wen-Yee Wong.
[00:02:49.302 --> 00:02:49.763]  Okay.
[00:02:49.763 --> 00:02:50.583]  Wen-Yee Wong.
[00:02:50.583 --> 00:02:51.845]  Now I got it right.
[00:02:51.845 --> 00:02:56.850]  Well, Dr. Wen-Yee Wong, we really appreciate you coming on with us.
[00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:57.931]  First off, I want to talk about
[00:02:58.883 --> 00:03:09.511]  What happened when you were in jail, after we saw you carted away, what they're charging you with, what you're facing, and then tell us about the murder in Communist Chinese.
[00:03:09.511 --> 00:03:20.139]  They charged me with a threat to the foreign state head, that means specifically the Chinese president.
[00:03:21.394 --> 00:03:24.596]  And it's going to be a rehearsal.
[00:03:24.596 --> 00:03:32.679]  I think there's a hearing next Wednesday to decide how they are going to proceed legally.
[00:03:32.679 --> 00:03:49.427]  But one thing I just want to make clear, and this is not a threat, because I just want to urgently call upon the people's help, because there is an atrocity going on, especially
[00:03:50.003 --> 00:03:50.984]  Thank you.
[00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:21.905]  uh... make the money out of them and let me tell you what's going on and i'll stop you there for just a second yeah specifically right now what are you being charged with because they're saying they're going to charge you have a charge you yet with the intimidating a foreign uh... official yet that at the apart today but they are at me
[00:04:22.265 --> 00:04:28.746]  Okay, now let me add to that that I have your full quote here, but can you re-quote it for us?
[00:04:28.746 --> 00:04:32.727]  Because basically you said that their days of doing this are numbered.
[00:04:32.727 --> 00:04:41.709]  I would certainly hope their days of grabbing peaceful people and murdering them ghoulishly for their organs would be numbered, but our media is trying to spin that.
[00:04:41.709 --> 00:04:45.050]  Can you please give us exactly what you said?
[00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:50.831]  And because I said in Chinese, I don't know the media, how they got the translation.
[00:04:50.831 --> 00:04:53.211]  It's a really distorted message.
[00:04:53.211 --> 00:05:04.053]  Because I said that if you continue to persecute Falun Gong and your day to be numbered, that means that your time is running out.
[00:05:04.053 --> 00:05:06.314]  That would be your office.
[00:05:06.314 --> 00:05:08.294]  The time you're in your office.
[00:05:08.294 --> 00:05:13.315]  How could I, myself, can really stretch such a
[00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:19.936]  Uh, head of state have the millions of the soldier.
[00:05:19.936 --> 00:05:22.600]  I'll tell you there's a four million soldier and his command.
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.161]  And how could I have a threat to his life?
[00:05:27.161 --> 00:05:37.166]  Basically, I just want to say that there's a saying, a Chinese saying, if you do something really bad, something bad will come to you.
[00:05:37.166 --> 00:05:39.507]  We have a lot of Chinese listeners over the internet.
[00:05:39.507 --> 00:05:48.731]  Why don't you say hi to them and repeat what you said to the dictator of China in Chinese for us.
[00:05:48.731 --> 00:05:50.451]  I just recalled his name, Hu Jintao.
[00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:52.660]  That's it!
[00:06:06.625 --> 00:06:10.207]  Would you say that China is now more oppressive than it was a decade ago?
[00:06:10.207 --> 00:06:12.127]  Because it looks to me like it is more oppressive.
[00:06:12.127 --> 00:06:19.230]  Every few weeks there are riots of farmers and others against men with machine guns.
[00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:24.973]  I mean, why are the Chinese people revolting like never before since the revolution in 1949?
[00:06:24.973 --> 00:06:30.115]  I think the people now had a more connection with the outside world.
[00:06:30.115 --> 00:06:32.116]  And before it closed up.
[00:06:32.116 --> 00:06:34.097]  And now they have, even though they
[00:06:34.594 --> 00:06:41.098]  They censored the information and severed the connection of the Chinese with the outside world.
[00:06:41.098 --> 00:06:47.941]  But people can get around and using the internet and watch the program and in different ways.
[00:06:47.941 --> 00:07:00.628]  So now they realize what kind of a situation they live in and they want more freedom of speech and the freedom of the assembly and the freedom of belief, which ironically
[00:07:01.269 --> 00:07:06.638]  And guaranteed by Chinese own constitution, but we never really enjoyed that privilege.
[00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:17.314]  The persecution of Falun Gong is one of the typical examples of the Chinese Communist Party regularly do.
[00:07:17.314 --> 00:07:21.676]  They also persecute Buddhists, Christians, basically anybody.
[00:07:21.676 --> 00:07:24.017]  And I'm going to let you get into the persecution of the Falun Gong.
[00:07:24.017 --> 00:07:29.959]  We've covered it quite a bit here and I've interviewed Falun Gong before and we're going to give you some time, Doctor, to speak about that.
[00:07:29.959 --> 00:07:33.981]  But I want to get back to what did they do to you once they had arrested you?
[00:07:33.981 --> 00:07:36.942]  What was it like having news reporters trying to cover your mouth?
[00:07:37.282 --> 00:07:44.823]  And what is it like to see the American government act like this murdering dictator is a good person?
[00:07:44.823 --> 00:07:52.385]  I think my intention there, and this is coming from a long way, actually.
[00:07:52.385 --> 00:07:56.405]  I try to use the normal channel to deliver the message.
[00:07:56.405 --> 00:08:05.747]  In fact, in the last few weeks, I talked to quite a number of officials in Congress level, Senate level, and to raise the alarm
[00:08:06.815 --> 00:08:17.818]  The message, because I think that right now, still, quite a number of the people held in labor camps, their organs being harvested.
[00:08:17.818 --> 00:08:36.163]  And once we report this news in March 8th, that's the first time we report, and there are several thousand people held in one of the facilities in Shenyang City, Liaoning Province, and their organs have been harvested and sold for quite a number of money.
[00:08:36.681 --> 00:08:40.665]  And let me tell you what they're advertising in that website.
[00:08:40.665 --> 00:08:48.272]  The website in that city called China International Transplantation Center in Shenyang.
[00:08:48.272 --> 00:08:59.142]  And they're advertising worldwide, say, if you want to have an organ transplant coming to our center, we can give you an organ within two weeks.
[00:08:59.142 --> 00:09:00.403]  As a physician, I know
[00:09:01.806 --> 00:09:04.748]  It's not simple to do the transplantation.
[00:09:04.748 --> 00:09:14.392]  Not only you need a blood type match, and most importantly, you have to match your tissue, HLA antigens.
[00:09:14.392 --> 00:09:30.659]  So, in the United States, if someone wants the kidney or liver, they have to wait for years, or two years minimum, and sometimes the people will wait for longer, because not so many people donate their organs.
[00:09:31.158 --> 00:09:39.505]  But in China, because they persecuted Falun Gong, they have a policy, say, we kill you because you didn't listen to the Communist Party.
[00:09:39.505 --> 00:09:41.006]  So you're a criminal.
[00:09:41.006 --> 00:09:47.171]  So your body, once you're being killed, they don't need a consent from the family member.
[00:09:47.171 --> 00:09:55.658]  They just took the organ and gave it to the cell in the international market to make money.
[00:09:55.658 --> 00:09:59.181]  Well, Dr. Wong, you've hit the nail on the head here.
[00:09:59.181 --> 00:10:00.642]  Let me break this down for listeners.
[00:10:02.523 --> 00:10:15.392]  The Chinese government and the private hospitals that they control openly, and this has been in the mainstream news, advertise that they have the best organs available.
[00:10:15.392 --> 00:10:21.136]  There's not a two, three year wait, like when my step-grandfather had hepatitis from blood transfusion years before.
[00:10:21.136 --> 00:10:23.978]  It took him about two years of waiting to get a proper liver.
[00:10:24.378 --> 00:10:28.559]  They have to wait until someone dies in an auto accident or dies of other causes.
[00:10:28.559 --> 00:10:31.239]  Then they hurriedly fly the organs to you.
[00:10:31.239 --> 00:10:33.800]  You go in on just a few hours notice.
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:34.780]  You have it done.
[00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:35.700]  But no!
[00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:37.621]  They get your blood type here in the U.S.
[00:10:37.621 --> 00:10:41.541]  or in Japan or in England or in France or in Russia if you're wealthy.
[00:10:41.541 --> 00:10:43.042]  You fly to China.
[00:10:43.042 --> 00:10:46.082]  They murder a peaceful political dissident.
[00:10:46.082 --> 00:10:48.483]  The Falun Gong is known for being non-violent.
[00:10:48.483 --> 00:10:50.903]  They've committed no crimes, done nothing wrong.
[00:10:50.903 --> 00:10:54.004]  They ghoulishly, like in a Nightmare Horror movie, like coma,
[00:10:54.744 --> 00:11:00.028]  Murder them, and they keep them alive while they take their organs, and they kill them, and then transplant it.
[00:11:00.028 --> 00:11:01.630]  This is openly admitted.
[00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:11.277]  Now our media, in CNN headlines, says, quote, that Falun Gong claims they take organs when the government advertises they do.
[00:11:11.277 --> 00:11:13.239]  So imagine how evil this is.
[00:11:13.239 --> 00:11:19.423]  Our government brings the murdering king rat that runs all this here to the U.S.
[00:11:19.423 --> 00:11:23.787]  Bill Gates tells him to act like he's a good guy when he's literally Adolf Hitler.
[00:11:24.887 --> 00:11:34.590]  They then, this doctor, this incredibly wonderful woman, full of courage and honor, stands up to this brutal sack of demons.
[00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:39.772]  She stands up to him, and then they don't just drag her out and arrest her and charge her with disorderly conduct.
[00:11:39.772 --> 00:11:47.554]  They're charging her with something out of a terrorism subdivision under new laws of intimidating foreign officials, Section 802 of the USA Patriot Act.
[00:11:48.363 --> 00:11:54.069]  Okay, I want Americans to realize the type of evil we're wallowing in.
[00:11:54.069 --> 00:12:01.797]  Now, from the inside reports you've gotten, can you describe, Doctor, how they murder these people, exactly what goes on for us?
[00:12:01.797 --> 00:12:09.285]  In fact, the March 8th, our newspaper report, because two witnesses came to us from China.
[00:12:09.645 --> 00:12:13.028]  They risked their life and told us the story.
[00:12:13.028 --> 00:12:18.632]  Before that, I have collected six cases of this, but an individual one.
[00:12:18.632 --> 00:12:28.820]  That time, and I saw, for example, Mr. Wang Bin, seven years old, is from an oil factory in Daqing, an oil factory.
[00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:39.308]  And his family sent me a photo and showed an autopsy card from the throat to the lower abdomen, and that's an autopsy card.
[00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:39.930]  That's
[00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:06.697]  Not only the heart and also the liver and the kidney, they all took it out and then closed up, then burned.
[00:13:06.697 --> 00:13:19.288]  Now, ma'am, doctor, the Falun Gong is known for being totally peaceful, but now our media would just run the headline, Chinese government says they're dangerous cult, and then wouldn't even say who you are, what you are.
[00:13:19.288 --> 00:13:22.411]  Our media is now demonizing the Falun Gong.
[00:13:23.607 --> 00:13:31.209]  And I think a lot of the media, because they couldn't get the information, they just copied the communist media.
[00:13:31.209 --> 00:13:34.831]  But in China, you have to realize that that's a state-run media.
[00:13:34.831 --> 00:13:37.972]  It's a mouthpiece of the Communist Party.
[00:13:37.972 --> 00:13:38.632]  They know that.
[00:13:38.632 --> 00:13:39.112]  They know that.
[00:13:39.112 --> 00:13:44.814]  Why are the... I mean, CNN cut the feed of you for the Chinese without the Chinese even asking.
[00:13:44.814 --> 00:13:48.375]  What does that mean to you that CNN cut your international feed?
[00:13:49.768 --> 00:13:52.329]  Um, I don't know.
[00:13:52.329 --> 00:13:56.571]  Actually, I was interviewed later and live on the program.
[00:13:56.571 --> 00:14:05.435]  They gave me four minutes to talk about this organ harvest, but I didn't have time to explain what's going on.
[00:14:05.435 --> 00:14:14.319]  I told them this is an unspeakable crime, which all of humanity, all of the races should stand up and say no.
[00:14:14.944 --> 00:14:18.847]  Otherwise, it's a shame for us to let it continue.
[00:14:18.847 --> 00:14:21.930]  And this involves thousands and thousands of people's lives.
[00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:27.354]  It's a crime that we just simply cannot tolerate.
[00:14:27.354 --> 00:14:32.758]  Just from the camps you know of, how many people are they brutally murdering for their organs?
[00:14:32.758 --> 00:14:35.441]  And the witness came to us.
[00:14:35.441 --> 00:14:37.943]  They talked about thousands of them.
[00:14:37.943 --> 00:14:42.326]  And it's interesting that once we expose this case,
[00:14:43.772 --> 00:14:46.452]  The China is kind of chaotic over there.
[00:14:46.452 --> 00:14:58.294]  And three weeks after we exposed this case, the foreign ministry spokesperson had a conference in Beijing and said, this is a liar.
[00:14:58.294 --> 00:15:07.376]  After three weeks, then they said, now we will welcome all the investigation team coming to the facility to have an investigation.
[00:15:07.376 --> 00:15:09.456]  And of course, that's three weeks.
[00:15:09.456 --> 00:15:11.637]  You can imagine what they can do.
[00:15:11.637 --> 00:15:13.037]  They can clear up everything.
[00:15:13.975 --> 00:15:18.219]  Yeah, they had a stage-managed Warren Commission.
[00:15:18.219 --> 00:15:28.988]  Then they had, actually, they invited diplomats from the United States two weeks after we published the paper.
[00:15:28.988 --> 00:15:33.131]  Well, it makes it even more ridiculous that your group is known to be totally
[00:15:52.088 --> 00:15:52.928]  Totally peaceful.
[00:15:52.928 --> 00:15:55.669]  That's part of your religious beliefs.
[00:15:55.669 --> 00:15:58.710]  For those that don't know, describe what the Falun Gong are.
[00:15:58.710 --> 00:16:00.471]  Describe your basic tenets.
[00:16:00.471 --> 00:16:05.752]  Yes, and the Falun Gong is a very ancient type of the practice.
[00:16:05.752 --> 00:16:08.773]  And we call the mind-body exercise.
[00:16:08.773 --> 00:16:12.814]  The theory is really rooted from the Buddhist school and Taoist school.
[00:16:12.814 --> 00:16:14.495]  You know the Tai Chi, right?
[00:16:14.495 --> 00:16:14.615]  Yes.
[00:16:14.615 --> 00:16:15.335]  The Tai Chi.
[00:16:15.335 --> 00:16:18.716]  It's very similar to Tai Chi, very slow motion exercise.
[00:16:19.315 --> 00:16:25.681]  There's a five-step exercise that you can do, and it gives you energy to purify your body.
[00:16:25.681 --> 00:16:30.925]  And so there's a spiritual or moral teaching principle.
[00:16:30.925 --> 00:16:33.587]  The Tibetan monks do this.
[00:16:33.587 --> 00:16:35.709]  They call it the Fountain of Youth.
[00:16:35.709 --> 00:16:38.872]  Then they teach truthfulness, compassion, tolerance.
[00:16:38.872 --> 00:16:40.794]  And as a physician, I know this is...
[00:16:41.773 --> 00:16:48.857]  If you wanted to be healthy and well-being, you need to practice something both mentally and physically.
[00:16:48.857 --> 00:16:52.519]  Why are the Communist Chinese butchers so afraid of Falun Gong?
[00:16:52.519 --> 00:17:06.146]  I think because they feel... First of all, because such practices talk about the balance of both mind and body, they didn't want the people to know or to be
[00:17:07.185 --> 00:17:14.548]  To be conscious about themselves, and to study something that's outside of the Chinese Communist ideology.
[00:17:14.548 --> 00:17:16.248]  They don't want people to have an identity.
[00:17:16.248 --> 00:17:16.768]  You're right.
[00:17:16.768 --> 00:17:30.433]  Then, another thing is, they're really, really scared of the popularity of Falun Gong, because in seven years they've grown up like double the Communist Party number.
[00:17:30.433 --> 00:17:33.254]  A hundred million people practicing in seven years.
[00:17:33.254 --> 00:17:35.335]  Is there persecution of Falun Gong working?
[00:17:36.415 --> 00:17:38.997]  And not working at all.
[00:17:38.997 --> 00:17:53.786]  And because since they start the persecution, and in fact, outside China, there's 75 countries of people start practicing Falun Gong.
[00:17:53.786 --> 00:18:01.731]  Then more people coming to find out what's going on, then a lot of people, including the Westerners, start practicing Falun Gong.
[00:18:03.297 --> 00:18:12.132]  Well, I know before the mid-70s, these murdering Chinese Communist leaders didn't come here, and I don't think our President should meet with them.
[00:18:12.132 --> 00:18:16.339]  They are disgusting criminals, and to meet with them only gives them aid and comfort.
[00:18:18.027 --> 00:18:21.130]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:18:21.130 --> 00:18:23.052]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:18:23.052 --> 00:18:28.057]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:18:28.057 --> 00:18:32.922]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[00:18:32.922 --> 00:18:37.326]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:18:37.326 --> 00:18:37.927]  The Constitution
[00:18:38.247 --> 00:18:45.112]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:18:45.112 --> 00:18:49.755]  Marshall Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:18:49.755 --> 00:18:57.241]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[00:19:19.186 --> 00:19:30.274]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[00:19:30.274 --> 00:19:34.856]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[00:19:34.856 --> 00:19:46.184]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[00:19:46.784 --> 00:19:54.007]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[00:19:54.007 --> 00:19:56.648]  Your purified water is now ready!
[00:19:56.648 --> 00:20:01.931]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 Host Filter Elements.

[00:20:16.357 --> 00:20:16.757]  I think so.

[00:21:20.306 --> 00:21:22.327]  This show is documented.
[00:21:22.327 --> 00:21:25.508]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:21:25.508 --> 00:21:29.469]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[00:21:29.469 --> 00:21:34.091]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[00:21:34.091 --> 00:21:38.152]  And it burns, burns, burns, the ring of fire.
[00:21:38.152 --> 00:21:41.793]  Dr. Wayne Lee Wong is our guest.
[00:21:41.793 --> 00:21:46.435]  Dr., give out any Falun Gong websites or news websites where our listeners can learn more.
[00:22:04.147 --> 00:22:11.249]  I know we have links on Infowars.com over to your organization's sites, but give those out for our listeners, please.
[00:22:11.249 --> 00:22:21.113]  Yes, if you're interested, you can log in at www.falundafa.org.
[00:22:21.113 --> 00:22:24.414]  The Falundafa spelling is F-A-L-U-N-D-A-F-A.
[00:22:29.537 --> 00:22:32.520]  Or they go to the Epoch Times.
[00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:42.068]  And the Epoch Times, yes, that's the newspaper we expose what happened in China, the cases I mentioned, and we have a serious report.
[00:22:42.068 --> 00:22:51.757]  And the website www.epochtime.com, that's in Chinese, E-P-O-C-H, Times.
[00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:55.052]  And for the English, we have eight languages.
[00:22:55.052 --> 00:22:57.193]  This is an international newspaper.
[00:22:57.193 --> 00:23:00.055]  Eight languages distributed in about 40 countries.
[00:23:00.055 --> 00:23:04.978]  So the English one is theepaktime.com.
[00:23:04.978 --> 00:23:09.101]  Now, we've also confirmed that they also murder Christians and take their organs.
[00:23:09.101 --> 00:23:11.363]  Can you tell us about that?
[00:23:11.363 --> 00:23:20.849]  And in fact, in the last 30 years, they have a document that mentions the white part of the abuse using the
[00:23:21.314 --> 00:23:24.937]  Yes, there are congressional ongoing hearings, it's admitted it's going on, and the national media says
[00:23:47.137 --> 00:23:48.418]  that Falun Gong claims.
[00:23:48.418 --> 00:23:50.560]  Specifically, Christians and other groups.
[00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:54.242]  Can you tell us about how they're murdered?
[00:23:54.242 --> 00:24:11.775]  Actually, the Christians and other dissidents, anyone, you have your own belief, and the underground church, and people being suffering, and the torture, and quite a number of the people being beaten to death.
[00:24:11.775 --> 00:24:13.657]  They're all thinking out.
[00:24:14.233 --> 00:24:34.233]  Last year, the Minister of the Health Department of China came to one of the meetings in the Philippines and admitted that 95% of the organ transplantation took place and the donor actually executed the prisoner.
[00:24:39.145 --> 00:24:47.186]  In China, they said that those organs, they got consent from their family member, but in fact
[00:24:47.651 --> 00:24:55.594]  Most of the time, they really threaten the people to have this donor or organ donation.
[00:24:55.594 --> 00:25:02.276]  We've also caught them selling the dead bodies of babies that they murder in front of the parents if they have more than two children.
[00:25:02.276 --> 00:25:09.118]  I also wanted to bring up the riots every month where the farmers are fighting back against machine guns.
[00:25:09.118 --> 00:25:10.018]  Were you aware of that?
[00:25:10.018 --> 00:25:12.559]  Do you have comments on the growing resistance in China?
[00:25:13.519 --> 00:25:18.382]  Oh, that one, I'm probably not in a good position to make a comment.
[00:25:18.382 --> 00:25:24.987]  The only thing I can add to the news I reported is regarding the military part.
[00:25:24.987 --> 00:25:34.313]  There's a famous argument that last year, in June, the former general of the Chinese Army
[00:25:35.769 --> 00:25:39.650]  Yes, he said he'd nuke the U.S.
[00:25:39.650 --> 00:25:41.051]  Yes, he said he'd nuke the U.S.

[00:26:24.284 --> 00:26:26.245]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:26:26.245 --> 00:26:32.246]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[00:26:32.246 --> 00:26:37.708]  The Berkey Light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[00:26:37.708 --> 00:26:47.351]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[00:26:47.351 --> 00:26:52.272]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[00:26:52.612 --> 00:26:56.816]  The lights can run all night on a single charge and it is bright enough to read by.
[00:26:56.816 --> 00:27:01.961]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light and allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[00:27:01.961 --> 00:27:07.866]  The Murky Lights revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.

[00:27:26.791 --> 00:27:29.191]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:27:29.191 --> 00:27:31.952]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:27:38.487 --> 00:27:43.328]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:27:43.328 --> 00:27:44.909]  You want answers?
[00:27:44.909 --> 00:27:46.449]  Well, so does he.
[00:27:46.449 --> 00:27:50.650]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:27:50.650 --> 00:27:55.272]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:27:55.272 --> 00:28:01.333]  She's leaving us in a few minutes and I'll get into some other news issues and items internationally, nationally.
[00:28:01.333 --> 00:28:07.195]  But she's Dr. Wing Wing Wong and you saw her get arrested for simply asking a mass murdering killer
[00:28:07.981 --> 00:28:13.325]  Killed more people, works for the government that killed more people than Hitler and Stalin.
[00:28:13.325 --> 00:28:16.607]  Openly selling organs on the world market, publicly doing it.
[00:28:16.607 --> 00:28:22.011]  The big story is our media spins it and acts like they don't know if it's true, when in the past they've admitted it.
[00:28:22.011 --> 00:28:25.774]  And I just want to commend you Dr. Wong for your amazing courage.
[00:28:25.774 --> 00:28:27.055]  My heart goes out to you.
[00:28:27.055 --> 00:28:28.596]  I will pray for you.
[00:28:29.642 --> 00:28:31.364]  I believe in what you're doing.
[00:28:31.364 --> 00:28:32.606]  Your courage is amazing.
[00:28:32.606 --> 00:28:35.829]  You totally did what Americans wouldn't do.
[00:28:35.829 --> 00:28:44.720]  You shifted it away from this love fest with this murderer and made everybody face the evil of our country being in bed with these people.
[00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:48.964]  And then you bring up how the top communist general says they're targeting 200 U.S.
[00:28:48.964 --> 00:28:52.347]  cities, called a press conference, said they'll preemptively kill us.
[00:28:52.347 --> 00:28:56.432]  They're threatening to kill all our families, but our government loves them and Walmart loves them.
[00:28:56.432 --> 00:28:58.634]  This is serious business.
[00:28:58.634 --> 00:29:00.596]  Closing comments here in the last few minutes, Doctor.
[00:29:01.577 --> 00:29:07.523]  And there was one thing I want to say, and for Falun Gong practitioners, they are very peaceful.
[00:29:07.523 --> 00:29:20.034]  For me, there's one thing you talk about me, I just want to make one correction, because I came to this country 20 years ago as a student, then I got a PhD in the University of Chicago,
[00:29:21.442 --> 00:29:33.130]  I passed the board exam, so I trained as a pathologist in UC San Diego, University of California San Diego, and the Mount Sinai Hospital.
[00:29:33.130 --> 00:29:45.540]  Now I'm currently the chief editor for the Medicine and Life magazine, and I volunteer to do this for the epic time, especially the health-related news.
[00:29:46.771 --> 00:29:57.135]  The real reason I'm doing this, this time, is because I feel the urgency to stop the life harvest organ from practitioners.
[00:29:57.135 --> 00:30:07.219]  They are peaceful, they just simply have this belief and practice something good for their body and mind, and they should have a right and a privilege for that.
[00:30:08.796 --> 00:30:19.888]  And I would add to that, the addendum, that you've already made them shut down one of the execution harvesting centers, at least for a few weeks, when they had a staged inspection.
[00:30:19.888 --> 00:30:22.911]  So you have already saved some lives.
[00:30:22.911 --> 00:30:27.075]  And so I want this Chinese leader to know what's going on.
[00:30:30.347 --> 00:30:32.869]  I really want to work for the people.
[00:30:32.869 --> 00:30:34.890]  They should be investigated fully.
[00:30:34.890 --> 00:30:43.176]  And I opened up this fully independent international team to fully investigate throughout all the labor camps in China.
[00:30:43.176 --> 00:30:44.356]  Let me ask you a question.
[00:30:44.356 --> 00:30:45.918]  So you're calling for international investigation.
[00:30:45.918 --> 00:30:47.058]  Let me ask you a question.
[00:30:47.058 --> 00:30:50.461]  How do the communist police and military feed on their own people?
[00:30:50.461 --> 00:30:52.522]  How do they bash babies' brains out?
[00:30:52.522 --> 00:30:54.023]  How do they steal organs?
[00:30:54.023 --> 00:30:56.785]  How do they engage in this evil and feel good about themselves?
[00:30:58.084 --> 00:31:25.437]  And these two witnesses told us, because her husband is responsible for removing the cornea from Practitioner Falun Gong, and he told us, Falun Gong, they gave some kind of anesthetic, then they actually took the organ, because the blood, for example, the heart, when you take it out, within four or six hours, you should transplant, otherwise they die, no use.
[00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:36.287]  So, they just do it in live person, then they basically kill the person, live the person, then give it to another.
[00:31:36.287 --> 00:31:39.410]  The heart they sell in international community is 200,000 U.S.
[00:31:39.410 --> 00:31:39.950]  dollars.
[00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:41.551]  That's 2 million Chinese dollars.
[00:31:44.468 --> 00:31:47.810]  For the kidney, they sell for $62,000.
[00:31:47.810 --> 00:31:50.231]  I'm not saying it's a lie or anything.
[00:31:50.231 --> 00:31:54.213]  Anyone can log in to their website and take a look at it.
[00:31:54.213 --> 00:31:57.115]  Yeah, tell us that website, because you're doing this for money is what you're saying.
[00:31:57.115 --> 00:31:57.655]  Give us the website.
[00:31:57.655 --> 00:32:05.300]  You just go to the website and type in the China International Transplantation Center, Assistant Center.
[00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:12.724]  So yesterday, the British Committee, the Committee for Transplantation Center, the doctor
[00:32:13.206 --> 00:32:13.466]  Absolutely.
[00:32:13.466 --> 00:32:15.688]  Doctor, again, I only want to commend you for your amazing courage.
[00:32:15.688 --> 00:32:16.369]  We salute you.
[00:32:16.369 --> 00:32:16.649]  Dr. Wong.
