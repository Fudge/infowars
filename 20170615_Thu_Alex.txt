[00:00.000 --> 00:19.600]  From the Infowars.com News Center, deep behind enemy lines in occupied Texas, broadcasting
[00:19.600 --> 00:25.600]  worldwide, you're listening to the voice of human resistance against the Technotronic
[00:25.600 --> 00:31.600]  Technocracy Takeover. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:31.600 --> 00:37.600]  Well, I've always been a news hero since I was a little boy. I liked non-fiction.
[00:37.600 --> 00:42.600]  Then as I grew older, I learned that a lot of the news itself was fiction.
[00:42.600 --> 00:51.600]  I am so honored that I'm being attacked in U.S. media more than Saddam Hussein was on the eve of both wars.
[00:51.600 --> 00:57.600]  I mean, I am being attacked more than Saddam Hussein, and they're now saying on CNN, Fox News, everywhere,
[00:57.600 --> 01:02.600]  that I am like Charlie Manson or Saddam Hussein.
[01:02.600 --> 01:10.600]  This is an incredible honor that Hollywood and MSM and the pedophile rings and the rest of them so mad at me.
[01:10.600 --> 01:16.600]  This is an extreme honor. I have asked God for this the last 25 years to really be set against the enemy.
[01:16.600 --> 01:21.600]  And thank you all for your prayers. It's really amazing to stand against radical Islam as well.
[01:21.600 --> 01:25.600]  Let's play a powerful Paul Watson report that I'm going to come back and break down the bombshell news.
[01:31.600 --> 01:37.600]  Steve Scalise and several other Republican lawmakers were shot by a deranged leftist gunman this morning.
[01:37.600 --> 01:42.600]  The shooter asked if the representatives were Democrats or Republicans before opening fire.
[01:42.600 --> 01:48.600]  Representative Mark Walker said the gunman, quote, was there to kill as many Republican members as possible.
[01:48.600 --> 01:59.600]  Before the shooter was named, I was smeared by the left for saying this was a terror attack carried out by an anti-Trump leftist radicalized by hysterical mainstream media propaganda.
[01:59.600 --> 02:05.600]  Oh look, turns out it was a terror attack carried out by an anti-Trump leftist radicalized by hysterical mainstream media propaganda.
[02:05.600 --> 02:14.600]  He was a Bernie Sanders voter. He said Trump should be locked up for treason. He was obsessed with conspiracy theories about Russia interfering in the election.
[02:14.600 --> 02:24.600]  He loved the Daily Show, John Oliver and Rachel Maddow. He literally said, quote, one of my favorite TV shows is the Rachel Maddow Show on MSNBC.
[02:24.600 --> 02:32.600]  So it was a terrorist attack targeting conservatives carried out by a deranged anti-Trump Russian collusion obsessed leftist.
[02:32.600 --> 02:35.600]  Gonna be hard for the mainstream media to spin that one, isn't it?
[02:35.600 --> 02:41.600]  Oh, but this guy on CNN says the shooter was just tired and Wolf Blitzer said nothing to challenge it.
[02:41.600 --> 02:48.600]  He wasn't evil that he was, I guess, tired of some of the politics that are going on.
[02:48.600 --> 02:50.600]  That's what we just heard.
[02:50.600 --> 02:57.600]  Give me a break. Can you imagine the freak out if an Info Wars fan tried to massacre a bunch of Democrats?
[02:57.600 --> 03:03.600]  Just like the Orlando massacre was Islamic terrorism. This was leftist terrorism.
[03:03.600 --> 03:13.600]  It's not about gun control. It's about a dominant culture that since before Trump was even elected has greased the skids for left wing domestic terrorism.
[03:13.600 --> 03:22.600]  How many times have you heard me warn that the media, the left and Hollywood's rampant anti-Trump hysteria was legitimizing violence against conservatives?
[03:22.600 --> 03:25.600]  Loretta Lynch talking about blood on the streets.
[03:25.600 --> 03:30.600]  They've marched. They've bled. Yes, some of them have died. This is hard.
[03:30.600 --> 03:41.600]  Kathy Griffin mock beheading Trump. New York Times sponsored theater productions where Trump is assassinated, the media applauding the whole punchin' at sea movement.
[03:41.600 --> 03:53.600]  Almost exactly a year ago, crazed left wing lunatic Michael Sanford tried to assassinate Donald Trump at a rally in Las Vegas after he grabbed an officer's gun and the media barely even reported on it.
[03:53.600 --> 04:03.600]  Celebrities envisioning anti-Trump violence over and over again. It's time to take some responsibility. This is your fault.
[04:03.600 --> 04:13.600]  What do you think's gonna happen when you relentlessly signal to deranged crazies that Trump and his administration are committing treason and are illegitimate?
[04:13.600 --> 04:19.600]  This. Exactly this. This is the context in which the shooting took place.
[04:19.600 --> 04:31.600]  And guess what? Leftists were more outraged about me pointing out these facts than they were other leftists celebrating the congressman being shot.
[04:31.600 --> 04:45.600]  Let that sink in. The media, the left and Hollywood must stop legitimizing violence and return to the realm of civil discussion. The blood is on their hands.
[04:45.600 --> 04:55.600]  This hatefulness that we see in this country today over policy differences has got to stop. We can have our differences, but let's not let it lead to such hate.
[05:16.600 --> 05:25.600]  Right on cue, one of the researchers blamed the ice on man-made climate change. But notice how it's typically government-funded scientists and politicians who are pushing the climate change agenda.
[05:25.600 --> 05:37.600]  Despite the fact that historically the biggest polluter in the world is the government. You see, the globalists harped the dangers of man-made climate change, which they renamed from global warming once the data didn't fit their agenda, to push for carbon taxes and carbon currencies.
[05:37.600 --> 05:45.600]  That allowed them to subjugate the US by impoverishing Americans for a new technocratic form of colonialism. The globalists don't want independent nation-states with strong economies.
[05:45.600 --> 05:55.600]  They want unelected, super-regional governments like the EU, consisting of member states that are subordinate to the globalist-controlled economy, driven by multinational banks and other unelected global bodies.

[06:25.600 --> 06:36.600]  Yeah, I've actually have just run out of my super-female. I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again. Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[06:36.600 --> 06:43.600]  And I know my hair is a little luxurious once again. So obviously the super-female is amazing. I love it.
[06:43.600 --> 06:57.600]  Nascent iodine is essential. Survival Shield X2. If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest it's nascent iodine Survival Shield X2. It's got a five star rating. It's a win-win infowarslife.com.
[07:13.600 --> 07:22.600]  This is one of the top three selling organic brands in the country that puts out high-quality organic shampoo, mouthwash, you name it.
[07:22.600 --> 07:28.600]  And if they're such patriots, they have led us to basically keep their well-known packaging. It is an answer to prayer.
[07:28.600 --> 07:38.600]  And because we're cutting out the middleman, 20% off retail, sign-up for auto-ship, an additional 25% off. It's all there. The body wash, the shampoo, the deodorant, the mouthwash.
[07:38.600 --> 07:51.600]  All of it is truly game-changing. It is the exact same product. Just the name is different, EmRick's Essentials, and it's on average 20% off what it would be in stores, buying it directly from infowarstore.com.

[08:16.600 --> 08:24.600]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty. It's Alex Jones.
[08:24.600 --> 08:51.600]  It is a fact that on the eve of the Gulf War in 1990, a PR firm was hired, and the daughter of the owner of the PR firm, who'd never been to Kuwait, and who spoke fluent English and been brought up in the U.S., went and testified to seeing Iraqi soldiers ripping babies out of incubators and bashing their brains out by the hundreds.
[08:51.600 --> 09:11.600]  This was used as the pretext to launch that war that was meant to legitimize the U.N. as a global government body and bring in a new world order, as George Herbert Walker Bush said, or Bush 41.
[09:11.600 --> 09:31.600]  Now, if criminal elements of our government will do something like that to launch now three wars in the Middle East, back radical jihadists to take over Iraq, Syria, Libya, other areas, overthrow our allies in Egypt,
[09:31.600 --> 09:44.600]  kill millions of people, starve millions more, and have Madeleine Albright, Clinton's Secretary of State, say a half million kids is an okay price to pay. In fact, let's queue that up.
[09:44.600 --> 10:02.600]  If they'll do that, then am I supposed to question Sandy Hook when it happens and they've got the kids going in circles in and out of the building, and they don't call the rescue helicopters, and then instead an hour later there's porta potties and food being delivered and PR firms are there,
[10:02.600 --> 10:15.600]  and Anderson Cooper says he's on location, but he's clearly faking the location. We looked at every angle of that. And so they've now misrepresented what we've said that I said it could have been totally true, could have been totally fake.
[10:15.600 --> 10:35.600]  I didn't regenerate. I didn't create. I wasn't the fount of that. The things that I am the fountain of I'll tell you 1776 worldwide rebooting America. Nationalism, but many other people are the creators of that as well.
[10:35.600 --> 10:45.600]  You are taking action. So something very interesting happened and I wasn't going to have proof of it.
[10:45.600 --> 10:52.600]  But then as God seems to work mysterious ways or somebody did this on purpose, I'm not sure.
[10:52.600 --> 11:02.600]  I did an interview with Hollywood reporter a few days ago because I knew they'd done a fairer job actually interviewing people like Stephen Bannon and others and actually letting him have quotes.
[11:02.600 --> 11:09.600]  They still attacked him, but they actually let him have real quotes. They're actually real journalists sometimes.
[11:09.600 --> 11:18.600]  And so they call me up hundreds of publications have called, but they always want to written statement or they want to act like they talk to me and then they don't ever really put anything I said in the piece.
[11:18.600 --> 11:37.600]  I've done some interviews where they go, Jones said no kids died on the phone today. Totally a lie or Jones said, you know, you want to suck my sausage. They're spiegel total lie. So I really can't be interviewed anymore because they just lie because they've been authorized to lie as political hit men and women.
[11:37.600 --> 11:53.600]  But just to give you a window into all of this and the big national firestorm and that they are now saying that I am like Charlie Manson and Saddam Hussein on Fox on singing in on MSNBC unified that a Don Salazar is posting it right now.
[11:53.600 --> 11:58.600]  He walked up and said, Have you seen this? And I said, Yeah, I know all about it.
[11:58.600 --> 12:03.600]  But it was just too fantastical to even tell people. So I wasn't going to tell you.
[12:03.600 --> 12:16.600]  I just there's too much stuff happening. I've decided to go ahead and tell you about this. There's the article cashed right there.
[12:16.600 --> 12:28.600]  The reporter calls me back and says, you know, I've never seen this before. This this this got pulled away from me. And I've interviewed everybody.
[12:28.600 --> 12:34.600]  Mr. Bond's name of the reporter, he said it got taken away at the top of the company and above. And I said, That's interesting.
[12:34.600 --> 12:41.600]  Then I was talking to one of my government sources and they said, No, this is a deep state CIA Disinformation Bureau.
[12:41.600 --> 12:55.600]  And when you say it's like wartime propaganda, like we see before a war, it's because it is and it is deep state an actual division of the State Department, the CIA and the Ford Foundation.
[12:55.600 --> 13:02.600]  And when I walked into that house that Megan Kelly had rented that night, I know Spooks when I see him. It was it was academic analyst Spooks.
[13:02.600 --> 13:09.600]  It was a like a CIA substation or something. And I was like, Wow, this is going to be big. This is the big hit piece.
[13:09.600 --> 13:17.600]  I told my wife it was a huge attack on the free press, an attempt to destroy me and set an example to intimidate everybody else.
[13:17.600 --> 13:24.600]  It's not the interview. It's what they say around the interview with the innuendo, just like they do about the president with these fake leaks,
[13:24.600 --> 13:29.600]  which then it turns out the leaks aren't even what they said they were.
[13:29.600 --> 13:33.600]  And I am just honored to be attacked at this level.
[13:33.600 --> 13:44.600]  But I was told by that reporter and I was told by a lot of other reporters, they said, Listen, this is the first time ever we're not allowed to actually say anything you've said.
[13:44.600 --> 13:51.600]  We're just basically supposed to make stuff up.
[13:51.600 --> 13:57.600]  And then I started reading last night, New York Times articles and others were where they slip up.
[13:57.600 --> 14:03.600]  Megan Kelly goes, Of course, I was nice to him. I had to fool him. She didn't fool me.
[14:03.600 --> 14:11.600]  And where they admit in newspapers that orders have gone out and that they're all working together to misrepresent.
[14:11.600 --> 14:21.600]  Imagine the entire MSM working together with comedy shows and news shows and thousands of newspapers to misrepresent who you are.
[14:21.600 --> 14:24.600]  There's only one other person this has happened to.
[14:24.600 --> 14:29.600]  And that's Donald John Trump. I am so honored to be in that company.
[14:29.600 --> 14:38.600]  And they're doing this to destroy Trump and to destroy the free press and to demonize the new burgeoning media.
[14:38.600 --> 14:41.600]  That's why they're misrepresenting what I said about 9-11.
[14:41.600 --> 14:46.600]  I've got the clips where they said that I said the firefighters blew it up because I said government was involved.
[14:46.600 --> 14:49.600]  No firefighters are the ones that told us about the countdown.
[14:49.600 --> 14:54.600]  Deep state working with the Islamists, just like they've done on the Arab Spring and the invasion of Europe with the UN.
[14:54.600 --> 14:56.600]  It's all public now.
[14:56.600 --> 14:59.600]  When I say inside job, I mean our government working with Islamists.
[14:59.600 --> 15:03.600]  And now you see the FBI and CIA saying it's like Islamists are above us.
[15:03.600 --> 15:06.600]  They know everything we're doing before we do it.
[15:06.600 --> 15:15.600]  Chinese patriots have been killed by the hundreds because the CIA gave China via moles who they are and where they are.
[15:15.600 --> 15:18.600]  And they say your CIA is communist.
[15:18.600 --> 15:22.600]  That was in even the Washington Post last week.
[15:22.600 --> 15:27.600]  We're totally penetrated, ladies and gentlemen, like with this winner lady, reality winner.
[15:27.600 --> 15:32.600]  You know, wanted to join the Taliban and said all whites should be exterminated and she was white.
[15:32.600 --> 15:38.600]  She had a top secret clearance. They are hiring total white jobs and they're all in the media.
[15:38.600 --> 15:42.600]  They're everywhere and they're just lying about what I say, lying about what I do.
[15:42.600 --> 15:45.600]  I point out our government criminally worked with Saudi Arabia.
[15:45.600 --> 15:47.600]  I say the firefighters blew up the towers.
[15:47.600 --> 15:48.600]  No, I didn't.
[15:48.600 --> 15:52.600]  I say, yes, my audience doesn't believe Newtown happened the way they said.
[15:52.600 --> 15:57.600]  It has a lot of earmarks of a PR stunt, but I tended to think people probably did get killed there.
[15:57.600 --> 16:04.600]  Then they make me the father of hurting children and that I'm hurting the families and I'm hurting children.
[16:04.600 --> 16:06.600]  And I'm this big monster like Charlie Manson.
[16:06.600 --> 16:09.600]  I've got the clips coming up.
[16:09.600 --> 16:13.600]  But doesn't work to call you a rat racist.
[16:13.600 --> 16:15.600]  Doesn't work to call you a Russian agent.
[16:15.600 --> 16:18.600]  Now they're saying it's OK for her to air this interview.
[16:18.600 --> 16:20.600]  Why we interview Charlie Manson.
[16:20.600 --> 16:22.600]  We interview child molesters.
[16:22.600 --> 16:23.600]  We interview.
[16:23.600 --> 16:25.600]  This is word for word coming up.
[16:25.600 --> 16:28.600]  And a lot of people going to see this and say, man, I feel sorry for you.
[16:28.600 --> 16:29.600]  I asked for this.
[16:29.600 --> 16:30.600]  I am honored.
[16:30.600 --> 16:44.600]  And I'm so blessed of my friends and my family and this crew that is my family who knows the truth and who sees the news and who sees the real clips and who knows what I really said for standing with me because they're standing by their own First Amendment and their own country.
[16:44.600 --> 16:46.600]  And I want to thank you for standing with us as well.
[16:46.600 --> 16:47.600]  We're making history.
[16:47.600 --> 16:49.600]  History is happening right now.
[16:49.600 --> 16:54.600]  And whether they're successful in destroying me or not, they're going to fall in the end.
[16:54.600 --> 16:57.600]  And what you're seeing is total desperation.
[16:57.600 --> 16:59.600]  Now, Dr. Course is going to pop in in a moment.
[16:59.600 --> 17:04.600]  And we are going to play some of these clips.
[17:04.600 --> 17:06.600]  And he's going to be in studio with us the next hour.
[17:06.600 --> 17:11.600]  But since I mentioned it, here's the babies in the incubator story.
[17:11.600 --> 17:14.600]  A fake report of children being murdered.
[17:14.600 --> 17:17.600]  Hundreds of children having their brains stomped out.
[17:17.600 --> 17:18.600]  Didn't happen.
[17:18.600 --> 17:21.600]  I'm not attacking any children Saddam ever killed.
[17:21.600 --> 17:23.600]  He was a bad guy.
[17:23.600 --> 17:25.600]  The point is this was fake.
[17:25.600 --> 17:29.600]  And the Gulf of Tonkin was fake in 1964 to get us into NAMM.
[17:29.600 --> 17:31.600]  And all the rest of it that then killed millions of people.
[17:31.600 --> 17:34.600]  So it's normal to question known liars.
[17:34.600 --> 17:38.600]  And what I did was question like everybody else.
[17:38.600 --> 17:39.600]  And I'm proud of the fact I questioned.
[17:39.600 --> 17:40.600]  I'm not running away from that.
[17:40.600 --> 17:43.600]  Like Joey Bayhard said on the view this morning.
[17:43.600 --> 17:45.600]  I'm proud of it.
[17:45.600 --> 17:46.600]  That I told the truth.
[17:46.600 --> 17:51.600]  Just because you misrepresent what I actually said is a straw man.
[17:51.600 --> 17:52.600]  It's not Alex Jones.
[17:52.600 --> 17:53.600]  And you're going to fail.
[17:53.600 --> 17:55.600]  People are going to find the real Alex Jones.
[17:55.600 --> 17:58.600]  The danger here is I've analyzed this attack profile.
[18:03.600 --> 18:04.600]  Must get this break.
[18:04.600 --> 18:13.600]  Volunteered at the Al-Adhan hospital with 12 other women who wanted to help as well.
[18:13.600 --> 18:15.600]  I was the youngest volunteer.
[18:15.600 --> 18:19.600]  Other women were from 20 to 30 years old.
[18:19.600 --> 18:24.600]  While I was there I saw the Iraqi soldiers coming to the hospital with guns.
[18:24.600 --> 18:27.600]  They took the babies out of incubators.
[18:27.600 --> 18:34.600]  They took the incubators and left the children to die on the cold floor.
[18:34.600 --> 18:38.600]  It was horrifying.
[18:38.600 --> 18:41.600]  I could not help but think of my nephew.
[18:41.600 --> 18:45.600]  Who if more premature might have died that day as well.
[18:45.600 --> 18:49.600]  There's hours of it.
[18:49.600 --> 18:52.600]  It was admitted to have been fake a month later.
[18:52.600 --> 18:53.600]  Totally fake.
[18:53.600 --> 18:54.600]  Never been to collate.
[18:54.600 --> 18:55.600]  No babies were killed.
[18:55.600 --> 18:57.600]  No babies were thrown out of incubators.
[18:57.600 --> 19:00.600]  Now if they'll stage that they'll stage anything.
[19:00.600 --> 19:01.600]  Then they personalize it.
[19:01.600 --> 19:05.600]  Then they go show families and say Jones says this or Jones says that.
[19:05.600 --> 19:07.600]  Or it's in the pedestrian emails.
[19:07.600 --> 19:09.600]  All this clear pedophile stuff.
[19:09.600 --> 19:12.600]  We break that weiner is sexting young girls trying to recruit them.
[19:12.600 --> 19:13.600]  That all came out later.
[19:13.600 --> 19:20.600]  They change the subject to a DC pizza place and say that I say Hillary's murdering children in a basement there.
[19:20.600 --> 19:23.600]  Never said it.
[19:23.600 --> 19:27.600]  Then when they come and attack me and say I'm saying it I say we never said that.
[19:27.600 --> 19:30.600]  We reported on some of the news report on the pizza place.
[19:30.600 --> 19:31.600]  I think it's a diversion.
[19:31.600 --> 19:35.600]  And they go he admits he lied when he said Hillary killed kids in a basement.
[19:35.600 --> 19:38.600]  Now I said Hillary funded the Arab Spring that killed hundreds of thousands of people.
[19:38.600 --> 19:41.600]  Tens of thousands of children sold into sex slavery.
[19:41.600 --> 19:44.600]  Then I hold up mainstream news articles admitting it.
[19:44.600 --> 19:51.600]  See they don't like me because I'm discrediting them because I'm exposing them because I have a memory and I go and show you what they've done in the past.
[19:51.600 --> 19:56.600]  And then you remember what you saw and you learn faster than I do in most cases.
[19:56.600 --> 20:02.600]  But make no mistake this attack on me is an attack on you.
[20:02.600 --> 20:12.600]  And if they can get away with this long term they're going to start doing this to many other people.
[20:12.600 --> 20:21.600]  This is a jihad just like they're hyping all over the news and the Huffington Post is saying you know too bad that this wasn't more coordinated.
[20:21.600 --> 20:24.600]  We need a mass violent attack.
[20:24.600 --> 20:31.600]  One of their writers is saying we don't need just a few congressmen shot or cop shot and black lives matter in George Soros.
[20:31.600 --> 20:33.600]  They're the monsters.
[20:33.600 --> 20:35.600]  They're the people that want civil war.
[20:35.600 --> 20:37.600]  They're the ones that say ISIS on CNBC.
[20:37.600 --> 20:42.600]  Please come blow up Trump's tower.
[20:42.600 --> 20:48.600]  They're the ones trying to organize insurrection and then using weaponized media viciously.
[20:48.600 --> 20:50.600]  And then I knew it was coming.
[20:50.600 --> 20:51.600]  This is what I said on Monday.
[20:51.600 --> 20:52.600]  Of course he briefly.
[20:52.600 --> 20:55.600]  I appreciate coming in the studio to tell us what's coming up in the next hour.
[20:55.600 --> 20:58.600]  He's going to be joining us.
[20:58.600 --> 21:03.600]  And I knew it all clicked on Monday and people said it's on Father's Day.
[21:03.600 --> 21:07.600]  That's when they announced they're going to air because they weren't clear before.
[21:07.600 --> 21:13.600]  And I went oh my gosh he kept asking me how do you feel for the fathers of the new town children.
[21:13.600 --> 21:14.600]  You're a father.
[21:14.600 --> 21:15.600]  And it all clicked.
[21:15.600 --> 21:18.600]  Guaranteed they're going to have promos that start up this weekend.
[21:18.600 --> 21:20.600]  We're on Father's Day.
[21:20.600 --> 21:22.600]  He says it never happened.
[21:22.600 --> 21:27.600]  And then sure enough they ran a promo Monday.
[21:27.600 --> 21:32.600]  And in the promo they edited it where I say Newtown never happened.
[21:32.600 --> 21:37.600]  When I said what you just heard me say five minutes ago, very clear but also nuanced historically
[21:37.600 --> 21:42.600]  that if they'll stage stuff in Iraq and kill half million Iraqis and send our troops in to die.
[21:42.600 --> 21:43.600]  Don't blame the troops.
[21:43.600 --> 21:44.600]  They got lied to like we did.
[21:44.600 --> 21:45.600]  Then they'll do anything.
[21:45.600 --> 21:46.600]  So it's okay to question.
[21:46.600 --> 21:47.600]  Boom.
[21:47.600 --> 21:50.600]  She cuts that and goes sounds like a cop out.
[21:50.600 --> 21:52.600]  What's Iraq got to do with it?
[21:52.600 --> 21:54.600]  See so none of it makes sense.
[21:54.600 --> 21:56.600]  This is the Psyop.
[21:56.600 --> 21:57.600]  This is the fake news.
[21:57.600 --> 21:58.600]  But here's the deal.
[21:58.600 --> 21:59.600]  I've analyzed it.
[21:59.600 --> 22:01.600]  We're going to beat them.
[22:01.600 --> 22:02.600]  They have no credibility.
[22:02.600 --> 22:04.600]  They have a 6% trust rate AP reports.
[22:04.600 --> 22:06.600]  And I tend to agree with that number.
[22:06.600 --> 22:13.600]  The problem is that the attack profile shows they may be getting ready to kill me.
[22:13.600 --> 22:15.600]  And of course he talked about this.
[22:15.600 --> 22:18.600]  They're clearly promoting Trump's death everywhere and members of Congress.
[22:18.600 --> 22:20.600]  And we are seen as the American resistance.
[22:20.600 --> 22:21.600]  I mean, you're looking at it.
[22:21.600 --> 22:26.600]  I don't want to be Sam Adams part two, but I've pretty much analyzed.
[22:26.600 --> 22:30.600]  If you compared what I do to 1776, I mean, I'm like Sam Adams.
[22:30.600 --> 22:31.600]  It's true.
[22:31.600 --> 22:32.600]  And I don't say that as a power trip.
[22:32.600 --> 22:34.600]  He was living in his time.
[22:34.600 --> 22:38.600]  He spent his money in the media to expose the globalist of the time, the British Empire.
[22:38.600 --> 22:41.600]  And you know, Dr. Corsi is like a Benjamin Franklin type.
[22:41.600 --> 22:44.600]  And Donald Trump stores Washington, ladies and gentlemen.
[22:44.600 --> 22:45.600]  And here's the deal.
[22:45.600 --> 22:47.600]  We're not saying that the power trip.
[22:47.600 --> 22:51.600]  We're saying that because we're under full globalist attack.
[22:51.600 --> 22:54.600]  Every channel, every day lies, lies, lies.
[22:54.600 --> 22:59.600]  And if you look at the attack profile, it only makes sense of their plan to kill us.
[22:59.600 --> 23:01.600]  And that means the president too.
[23:01.600 --> 23:03.600]  And that's what Corsi talked about on Monday as well.
[23:03.600 --> 23:06.600]  So I'm going to get a brief analysis of him of where this is going.
[23:06.600 --> 23:07.600]  And I want to go through all these clips.
[23:07.600 --> 23:13.600]  But ladies and gentlemen, they are now saying that I am in the company of child molesters.
[23:13.600 --> 23:16.600]  And then I am in the company of Charles Manson and Saddam Hussein.
[23:16.600 --> 23:21.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, to have the scum of the MSM that launched all these evil wars,
[23:21.600 --> 23:26.600]  that opened our borders, that decided with radical Islam, that has looted our pension funds,
[23:26.600 --> 23:29.600]  that has deindustrialized our nation, I am honored.
[23:29.600 --> 23:30.600]  I am serious.
[23:30.600 --> 23:31.600]  I am honored.
[23:31.600 --> 23:33.600]  Everybody knows I ask for this.
[23:33.600 --> 23:36.600]  And God just keeps giving whatever I ask for.
[23:36.600 --> 23:38.600]  But it's not a careful what you ask for.
[23:38.600 --> 23:45.600]  I am so honored that I can now begin to measure up to my ancestors that were extremely illustrious.
[23:45.600 --> 23:51.600]  And the founding of Texas and this great nation that I can now start to measure up to some of those people.
[23:51.600 --> 23:54.600]  I never even say who my ancestors are because, you know, it sounds like I'm bragging.
[23:54.600 --> 23:56.600]  I'll just leave it at that.
[23:56.600 --> 24:00.600]  And I am now beginning again, genetically and spiritually, to begin to measure up.
[24:00.600 --> 24:02.600]  And I'm going to go in through and beyond.
[24:02.600 --> 24:03.600]  It doesn't mean I won't stumble.
[24:03.600 --> 24:04.600]  It doesn't mean I won't fall.
[24:04.600 --> 24:06.600]  It doesn't mean I won't.
[24:06.600 --> 24:08.600]  Physically, probably fail.
[24:08.600 --> 24:10.600]  But spiritually, we're going to win.
[24:10.600 --> 24:18.600]  But this is a historic epic battle and now more than ever pray for America, pray for the world, pray for President Trump, pray for me, pray for my family.
[24:18.600 --> 24:23.600]  I've seen God working and I've seen every time the enemy hits us harder, we just get stronger.
[24:23.600 --> 24:33.600]  And it makes me sick to see our country falling this far, to be in the hands of these wicked globalists, how they're attacking our families, how they're promoting sexualization of young children.
[24:33.600 --> 24:35.600]  I mean, you see them on the news.
[24:35.600 --> 24:37.600]  You see them on Nickelodeon.
[24:37.600 --> 24:43.600]  You see MTV, you see MTV promoting murdering innocent white people and all this race baiting.
[24:43.600 --> 24:44.600]  I mean, these are horrible.
[24:44.600 --> 24:52.600]  The Muslims celebrated the tower burning up, even though a bunch of Muslims died saying, oh good, I hope the West all burns down yesterday in England.
[24:52.600 --> 25:00.600]  I mean, it's just a bunch of existential envy losers who hate the West and who hate honor and who hate strength.
[25:00.600 --> 25:02.600]  And Trump has done nothing but deliver.
[25:02.600 --> 25:11.600]  The guy has such courage, he's so amazing going to the hospital last night with the congressman fighting for his life still.
[25:11.600 --> 25:15.600]  And they're all over the news just celebrating this and saying, we need more, kill more.
[25:15.600 --> 25:22.600]  And nothing's being done because the government is still hijacked and Trump has this precarious beach head.
[25:22.600 --> 25:24.600]  But again, look how far we've come.
[25:24.600 --> 25:25.600]  This is the fight.
[25:25.600 --> 25:26.600]  We're going to win, people.
[25:26.600 --> 25:27.600]  Trump may fall.
[25:27.600 --> 25:29.600]  I may fall like the Alamo.
[25:29.600 --> 25:30.600]  It doesn't matter.
[25:30.600 --> 25:31.600]  It doesn't matter.
[25:31.600 --> 25:32.600]  It doesn't matter.
[25:32.600 --> 25:40.600]  We're going to live forever because the republic's going to live on and humanity's going to move on and have greater destiny because we're being men in our age.
[25:40.600 --> 25:50.600]  So I want to thank you all who've supported us over the years and have prayed for us because we are now under the full globalist assault.
[25:50.600 --> 25:52.600]  And again, the remorseless left.
[25:52.600 --> 25:55.600]  It's all over the news is celebrating or saying more death.
[25:55.600 --> 26:00.600]  They are just they are drunk on the on the on the blood of all the aborted children.
[26:00.600 --> 26:02.600]  They are just absolute demons.
[26:02.600 --> 26:12.600]  Dr. Corsi, thanks for coming in to pop in and tell us what's coming up at the bottom of the next hour when you join us with some of the other guests while you're down here in studio with us, our Washington bureau chief.
[26:12.600 --> 26:13.600]  You've heard me break this down.
[26:13.600 --> 26:16.600]  You have said that the next civil war is starting.
[26:16.600 --> 26:28.600]  They're initiating it and that this indicates from your psychological warfare training at the State Department and other areas that they are preparing to commence basically paramilitary operations against the republic.
[26:28.600 --> 26:31.600]  And they said that on Monday and now we're seeing it.
[26:31.600 --> 26:33.600]  Well, and Donald Trump is in the fight of his life.
[26:33.600 --> 26:35.600]  This is about impeachment.
[26:35.600 --> 26:43.600]  If if the left, the far left, the hard left, the Bill Ayers left violent cannot impeach Trump.
[26:43.600 --> 26:45.600]  They will assassinate him.
[26:45.600 --> 26:57.600]  And what we're going to do is we're going to start the deconstructing of the deep state so people understand exactly how it works and how Donald Trump needs in this hour to understand what JFK did not understand.
[26:57.600 --> 27:04.600]  And that this this is a serious threat and the the hard vicious violent left intends to win.
[27:04.600 --> 27:17.600]  I'm confident Donald Trump's going to win with with the help of God and all those out there who are going to stand behind Donald Trump and defend the United States of America and the Constitution because this is our freedom at stake.
[27:17.600 --> 27:22.600]  If we lose this battle, we lose the republic and Donald Trump.
[27:22.600 --> 27:30.600]  We've got to be blessed to have him there because Donald Trump, when he catches on to this and fully understands it, will fight back and will win.
[27:30.600 --> 27:31.600]  I'm confident of that.
[27:31.600 --> 27:34.600]  We need to deconstruct the deep state in order to help him.
[27:34.600 --> 27:37.600]  Well, Dr. Corsi, again, you're in the studio, but I'm looking at you on a camera here.
[27:37.600 --> 27:39.600]  I don't think I've ever seen you get tears in your eyes on air.
[27:39.600 --> 27:41.600]  Do you have tears in your eyes right now?
[27:41.600 --> 27:47.600]  This is a very emotional subject for me because as a kid, I was around Jack Kennedy a lot.
[27:47.600 --> 27:51.600]  I was around a lot of the people that tried to warn Jack Kennedy he was going to be killed.
[27:51.600 --> 27:56.600]  And he just, quite frankly, never really took it all that deeply.
[27:56.600 --> 27:58.600]  I mean, he understood it.
[27:58.600 --> 28:01.600]  Jack Kennedy had Addison's disease.
[28:01.600 --> 28:03.600]  He had a congenital spine ailment.
[28:03.600 --> 28:09.600]  He had to take massive shots of amphetamines every day in order to be able to walk.
[28:09.600 --> 28:11.600]  He did not want to end his life in a wheelchair.
[28:11.600 --> 28:19.600]  He had a very different perspective than Donald Trump, who just celebrated a birthday, happy birthday, and we hope that he's going to have many more.
[28:19.600 --> 28:26.600]  And I think Donald Trump is in this battle to win where John Kennedy, unfortunately, realized he'd already lost.
[28:26.600 --> 28:28.600]  That's right, and let's be clear.
[28:28.600 --> 28:32.600]  We cannot stress to you the peril the country is in.
[28:32.600 --> 28:36.600]  As I told Stone that night when Trump won, I said, the real war just started, brother.
[28:36.600 --> 28:37.600]  I knew it intellectually.
[28:37.600 --> 28:40.600]  I could feel it in my gut, and I could feel what was coming down.
[28:40.600 --> 28:43.600]  I told my wife two weeks ago, I said, baby, something about 50 times worse.
[28:43.600 --> 28:44.600]  She said, I'm standing by.
[28:44.600 --> 28:45.600]  I understand that.
[28:45.600 --> 28:53.600]  And I told her, I said, down the road, I haven't got around telling my kids this yet, but, you know, I'm not feeling sorry for myself.
[28:53.600 --> 28:57.600]  I'm very honored, but they want to destroy us in front of everybody to try to scare people.
[28:57.600 --> 28:58.600]  And I'm not scared.
[28:58.600 --> 29:01.600]  I just want the listeners to stay strong and stay focused.
[29:01.600 --> 29:06.600]  We can't turn our kids over to all these pedophiles and devil worshipers and communists and Muslims.
[29:06.600 --> 29:07.600]  And that's what they are.
[29:07.600 --> 29:12.600]  They just are a bunch of scum and they hate us because we're good and they know we love God.
[29:12.600 --> 29:20.600]  And so we need to pray, you know, to Christ for discernment and for strength and that his will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
[29:20.600 --> 29:25.600]  So I think I'm going to come back with the Lord's prayer after this break, but we're here.
[29:25.600 --> 29:27.600]  We're in the fulcrum and this is it.
[29:27.600 --> 29:29.600]  All right, Dr. Corsi, we'll see you in the middle of the next hour.
[29:29.600 --> 29:30.600]  Thanks for visiting us here in Austin.
[29:30.600 --> 29:32.600]  Great pleasure and honor to be here. Thank you.
[29:32.600 --> 29:33.600]  Absolutely, folks.
[29:33.600 --> 29:34.600]  This is the fight.
[29:34.600 --> 29:35.600]  This is it.
[29:35.600 --> 29:36.600]  I feel so good right now.
[29:36.600 --> 29:38.600]  I feel really close to God.
[29:38.600 --> 29:44.600]  Never felt as close to God because the enemy is preparing horrible things against us all.
[29:44.600 --> 30:09.600]  Prepare for the main attack, ladies and gentlemen.
[30:14.600 --> 30:17.600]  It's a random woman on the street giving her opinion.
[30:17.600 --> 30:25.600]  And the fact that he would make a very specific request to have everybody else leave the office so that he would be alone with Comey.
[30:25.600 --> 30:27.600]  For me, speaks volumes.
[30:27.600 --> 30:33.600]  Well, it turns out that this random woman just happened to be political strategist Alma Marquez.
[30:33.600 --> 30:37.600]  But this is what we've all learned to expect from the establishment news media,
[30:37.600 --> 30:45.600]  where perhaps the worst reputation belongs to CNN, who has a long history of questionable news reporting,
[30:45.600 --> 30:50.600]  including the recent staged Muslim anti-terror protest,
[30:50.600 --> 30:56.600]  where you can clearly see host Becky Anderson directing the entire scene.
[30:56.600 --> 30:59.600]  And you can learn more right now at infowars.com.
[30:59.600 --> 31:01.600]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[31:01.600 --> 31:03.600]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[31:03.600 --> 31:06.600]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[31:06.600 --> 31:12.600]  The artificial particulates of the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[31:12.600 --> 31:19.600]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure ground-breaking water filtration systems
[31:19.600 --> 31:21.600]  have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze.
[31:21.600 --> 31:26.600]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children,
[31:26.600 --> 31:29.600]  to the best job you can to purify your air.
[31:29.600 --> 31:37.600]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most toxic effects for themselves.
[31:37.600 --> 31:39.600]  The general public doesn't.
[31:39.600 --> 31:43.600]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[31:43.600 --> 31:47.600]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[31:47.600 --> 31:49.600]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house,
[31:49.600 --> 31:53.600]  replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[31:53.600 --> 31:59.600]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at m4warstore.com.

[33:00.600 --> 33:02.600]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[33:31.600 --> 33:35.600]  Right and wrong.
[33:35.600 --> 33:37.600]  We know Hollywood.
[33:37.600 --> 33:39.600]  We know the globalists are evil.
[33:39.600 --> 33:42.600]  We know you're liars.
[33:42.600 --> 33:46.600]  You're going to be put through the fire, the fire you've already started.
[33:50.600 --> 33:59.600]  New World Order, World Monetary Corporate Government, anti-free market, anti-family, anti-woman, anti-god, anti-child, anti-man,
[33:59.600 --> 34:05.600]  anti-decency, anti-productivity, anti-justice.
[34:05.600 --> 34:11.600]  Our Father, which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done, in earth as it is in heaven.
[34:11.600 --> 34:17.600]  Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us.
[34:17.600 --> 34:26.600]  And lead us not in a temptation, but deliver us from evil, for thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory forever and ever. Amen.
[34:26.600 --> 34:34.600]  And then it goes on, though I walk to the valley of the shadow of the dead, I shall fear no evil.
[34:34.600 --> 34:39.600]  And of course, why do you think Trump's wife came out unannounced and said that with tears in her eyes?
[34:39.600 --> 34:46.600]  Because can you imagine what they're dealing with behind the scenes because they're not devil worshipers?
[34:46.600 --> 34:50.600]  And because they love their family and prosperity in America?
[34:50.600 --> 34:57.600]  And all the fruits of a godly nation, despite the fact they're not perfect?
[34:57.600 --> 35:05.600]  Because when the devil comes against you, you get closer to God, and then you go, oh my gosh, God's real. Why was I ever afraid?
[35:05.600 --> 35:17.600]  The only thing you then fear is separation from God.
[35:17.600 --> 35:23.600]  He that dwelleth in the secret place the most high shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.
[35:23.600 --> 35:28.600]  I will say of the Lord, he is my refuge, my fortress, my God and him.
[35:28.600 --> 35:36.600]  Will I trust? Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler and from the noisome pestilence.
[35:36.600 --> 35:43.600]  He shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings, shout thou trust.
[35:43.600 --> 35:47.600]  His truth shall be thy shield and buckler.
[35:47.600 --> 35:50.600]  It's all there.
[35:50.600 --> 36:02.600]  Thou shalt not be afraid by the terror by night or the arrow that felleth by day.
[36:02.600 --> 36:12.600]  A thousand shall fall at thy side and ten thousand by thy right hand, but it shall not come nigh thee.
[36:12.600 --> 36:19.600]  As long as they can't get to your mind, they have such a psychological warfare and spiritual attack against info wars.
[36:19.600 --> 36:21.600]  I can't imagine what it's like around Trump.
[36:21.600 --> 36:26.600]  The mental illness around me is just rampant.
[36:26.600 --> 36:28.600]  It's a science fiction movie.
[36:28.600 --> 36:34.600]  We're living in the year 2017, ladies and gentlemen, and we're not battling against flesh and blood.
[36:34.600 --> 36:36.600]  Know that for a fact.
[36:36.600 --> 36:40.600]  We're fighting against really wicked powers.
[36:40.600 --> 36:43.600]  Most men roll over. They want success. They want to be praised.
[36:43.600 --> 36:46.600]  Most of these churches are the abode of evil.
[36:46.600 --> 36:48.600]  And I'm not up here on some high horse.
[36:48.600 --> 36:51.600]  People say, there's all this news. Why are you preaching?
[36:51.600 --> 36:52.600]  Let me tell you something.
[36:52.600 --> 36:54.600]  At the end of the day, that's all there is.
[36:54.600 --> 37:00.600]  It's good and evil, right and wrong on this fantastic planet.
[37:00.600 --> 37:08.600]  And I watch the lies that they tell about me and my family and the things they do.
[37:08.600 --> 37:11.600]  And to watch the reporters that follow me around their eyes,
[37:11.600 --> 37:18.600]  light up with like demoniac glow as they swear they're going to get me and see me fall.
[37:18.600 --> 37:24.600]  As if they're in some existential contest and that if I fall, they somehow rise.
[37:24.600 --> 37:30.600]  Fools.
[37:30.600 --> 37:37.600]  If you just tuned in, we've got a ton of news here. It's all important.
[37:37.600 --> 37:43.600]  But there are thousands of articles a day and every major TV program in the country,
[37:43.600 --> 37:55.600]  even bigger than Sessions testimony, even bigger than the trial of Cosby.
[37:55.600 --> 38:01.600]  Even bigger than all of that is Alex Jones is the devil.
[38:01.600 --> 38:06.600]  Alex Jones is horrible. Alex Jones is evil. Alex Jones did this.
[38:06.600 --> 38:11.600]  Alex Jones did that. And Donald Trump loves him.
[38:11.600 --> 38:20.600]  And they've had petitions to Trump and they've had reporters ask Trump and he hasn't forsaken me yet.
[38:20.600 --> 38:26.600]  But I almost want to tell the president, in fact, I have told the president before,
[38:26.600 --> 38:29.600]  if you disagree with some of the things I've said, throw me under the bus.
[38:29.600 --> 38:34.600]  I don't like seeing you sit there and have them twist what I've said against you.
[38:34.600 --> 38:39.600]  That's not how Trump is. He knows. They lie about him. They lie about me.
[38:39.600 --> 38:42.600]  He knows they twist everything.
[38:42.600 --> 38:48.600]  Two days after 9-11, he talked about how the towers fell and how the republic bombs inside.
[38:48.600 --> 38:54.600]  Trump's real smart, folks. He knew everything before I was born.
[38:54.600 --> 39:03.600]  Of course, he's going 45 years. Of course, he knew him before I was born.
[39:03.600 --> 39:09.600]  And Trump's the same way. Trump loves the energy of fighting evil.
[39:09.600 --> 39:16.600]  He's hired in a kite, totally naturally. No caffeine, no drugs, no nothing.
[39:16.600 --> 39:19.600]  Does like sweets.
[39:19.600 --> 39:26.600]  He is higher than a kite with all these attacks and all these lies as he just delivers jobs
[39:26.600 --> 39:31.600]  and delivers better healthcare and delivers sovereignty and delivers Americana.
[39:31.600 --> 39:42.600]  When he's there, he's ready, no matter what happens. And they cannot stand that.
[39:42.600 --> 39:47.600]  It's like that old song, I forget who's saying it, country music song from the 40s or 50s.
[39:47.600 --> 39:52.600]  Big John. Got to play that song if he can, going on to break a couple minutes of it.
[39:52.600 --> 40:00.600]  It's only a two-minute song. Big John. And there's Trump down at the bottom of the mind, holding it up.
[40:00.600 --> 40:05.600]  The girders, everybody can get out of the mind. Everybody else has gotten out.
[40:05.600 --> 40:11.600]  The bottom of that mind lies one hell of a man.
[40:11.600 --> 40:17.600]  And not because he wants to be a hero, because he's a good person.
[40:17.600 --> 40:21.600]  Just like you got pedophiles and devil worshipers and communists and Islamists,
[40:21.600 --> 40:28.600]  you've got people that don't like those people and want to stand up against them.
[40:28.600 --> 40:32.600]  The type of man that gets a smile on their face when they're loading something in their car in an alley
[40:32.600 --> 40:35.600]  and three thugs come over and think they're about to rob you.
[40:35.600 --> 40:40.600]  Because the only time your spirit even wakes up is when you're surrounded.
[40:40.600 --> 40:43.600]  That's the kind of person Donald Trump is.
[40:43.600 --> 40:50.600]  And those are the type of men that are going to save this country and this planet with God's help.
[40:50.600 --> 40:55.600]  But God set us on this planet to be tested.
[40:55.600 --> 41:08.600]  And if you don't want to be tested, then you're obviously not conscious. You're not alive.
[41:08.600 --> 41:12.600]  All right, I've got this news and these clips I want to hit. It's unbelievable.
[41:12.600 --> 41:15.600]  I can't even keep track of it all.
[41:15.600 --> 41:22.600]  Hundreds of clips. I can't watch them all. Each one is worse than the next or the last.
[41:22.600 --> 41:29.600]  It's just Alex Jones. It's like a child molester. Alex Jones is a criminal.
[41:29.600 --> 41:41.600]  But to have the empty, horrible, narcissistic, demonic mouth of Satan screaming that I'm the worst thing on earth.
[41:41.600 --> 41:47.600]  Man, that is a great honor.
[41:47.600 --> 41:52.600]  And now Hollywood reporter saying Megan Kelly stakes the sky high for her Alex Jones interview.
[41:52.600 --> 41:56.600]  Well, she interviewed me for four hours over a 12-hour period.
[41:56.600 --> 42:00.600]  They were here from 9.30 in the morning until about 11 at night, so it's all edited, scrambled crap.
[42:00.600 --> 42:03.600]  Oh, I probably should have opened the show with this.
[42:03.600 --> 42:12.600]  I'm going to play excerpts tonight.
[42:12.600 --> 42:17.600]  And I'm going to air some today of the Megan Kelly interview.
[42:17.600 --> 42:22.600]  Oh, it's going to premiere here first.
[42:22.600 --> 42:30.600]  Because she, in my educated research view, engaged in deception, sculduggery, fraud.
[42:30.600 --> 42:35.600]  And you're going to hear the phone calls where she promised that it was going to be a nice profile
[42:35.600 --> 42:38.600]  and that she wasn't going to attack me or would only barely mention certain subjects.
[42:38.600 --> 42:42.600]  And I just have 30-plus minutes of her lying.
[42:42.600 --> 42:46.600]  In fact, let's queue up that first clip right now.
[42:46.600 --> 42:48.600]  This is when she called me as I was driving down the road.
[42:48.600 --> 42:56.600]  And I said, let me get to the office, my pretty.
[42:56.600 --> 43:07.600]  And then she interviewed me for two hours on Newtown and Pizza Gate and all the rest of the made-up PR stuff that she shuffled at me.
[43:07.600 --> 43:11.600]  I mean, the made-up quotes, the made-up things I supposedly said.
[43:11.600 --> 43:13.600]  So they could edit it together.
[43:13.600 --> 43:18.600]  So here is Megan Kelly talking to me about a week before she came to town.
[43:18.600 --> 43:19.600]  Here it is.
[43:19.600 --> 43:25.600]  This is not going to be a contentious, you know, sort of gotcha exchange.
[43:25.600 --> 43:35.600]  That's not what this show is, and that's really not what I wanted to do.
[43:35.600 --> 43:39.600]  You say parents faked their children's death.
[43:39.600 --> 43:41.600]  People get very angry.
[43:41.600 --> 43:44.600]  Oh, I know, but they don't get angry about the half-million debt I racked from the sanctions,
[43:44.600 --> 43:46.600]  or they don't get angry about all the illegal foreign aid.
[43:46.600 --> 43:47.600]  That's a dodge.
[43:47.600 --> 43:48.600]  No, no, it's not a dodge.
[43:48.600 --> 43:51.600]  The media never covers all the evil wars it's promoted, all the big things.
[43:51.600 --> 43:54.600]  That doesn't excuse what you did and said about Newtown.
[43:54.600 --> 43:56.600]  That's good.
[43:56.600 --> 44:00.600]  Oh, this isn't going to be contentious.
[44:00.600 --> 44:06.600]  And I'm on tape with her saying, I know you're just going to hammer Newtown,
[44:06.600 --> 44:07.600]  because I knew she's one of their people.
[44:07.600 --> 44:09.600]  She goes and speaks at the event.
[44:09.600 --> 44:10.600]  She's an anti-gunner.
[44:10.600 --> 44:12.600]  I knew she was set to speak this year at their big gala.
[44:12.600 --> 44:14.600]  I said, this is a Newtown piece.
[44:14.600 --> 44:16.600]  She said, no, it's not.
[44:16.600 --> 44:18.600]  Alex, I promise you, this is a profile of you.
[44:18.600 --> 44:19.600]  I want to get big profiles.
[44:19.600 --> 44:21.600]  I don't want to do hard news anymore.
[44:21.600 --> 44:23.600]  I want to rehabilitate myself from Fox.
[44:23.600 --> 44:25.600]  I got it all on tape, sweetheart.
[44:25.600 --> 44:27.600]  You're a big, fat liar.
[44:27.600 --> 44:29.600]  Oh, and by the way, that's in the car.
[44:29.600 --> 44:35.600]  I got it real clear and nice here in my office right over there for 25 minutes.
[44:35.600 --> 44:39.600]  Oh, and we got more than that, sweetheart.
[44:39.600 --> 44:42.600]  You want to edit my comments?
[44:42.600 --> 44:44.600]  Want to play games?
[44:44.600 --> 44:48.600]  I'm going to call your bluff on that one, too.
[44:48.600 --> 44:50.600]  Oh, I know.
[44:50.600 --> 44:51.600]  The big order's out.
[44:51.600 --> 44:52.600]  Never show my real quotes.
[44:52.600 --> 44:54.600]  Never let me respond anywhere.
[44:54.600 --> 44:58.600]  Hollywood Reporter.
[44:58.600 --> 45:01.600]  Contact me through one of my other big sources and it says,
[45:01.600 --> 45:03.600]  we'll give you a straight up interview with real quotes.
[45:03.600 --> 45:05.600]  It gets killed at the very top.
[45:05.600 --> 45:06.600]  Then I talk to other sources.
[45:06.600 --> 45:11.600]  They said, no, there is a Pentagon CIA, Ford Foundation, high level.
[45:11.600 --> 45:12.600]  It's all being managed.
[45:12.600 --> 45:14.600]  No one is allowed to actually run your quotes.
[45:14.600 --> 45:16.600]  No one is allowed to actually interview you.
[45:16.600 --> 45:22.600]  Imagine, I've done probably 10 interviews the last week about this
[45:22.600 --> 45:24.600]  and none of them got published.
[45:24.600 --> 45:25.600]  None of them got put out.
[45:25.600 --> 45:27.600]  None of them got aired.
[45:27.600 --> 45:31.600]  Because they can't actually have what I said.
[45:31.600 --> 45:36.600]  The fake Alex Jones has to be given the spotlight so he can be destroyed.
[45:36.600 --> 45:38.600]  But the real one has to sit here.
[45:38.600 --> 45:41.600]  I promise you, oh, I want to get a big juice.
[45:41.600 --> 45:42.600]  I'm obsessed with you.
[45:42.600 --> 45:44.600]  Okay, Alex, I'm obsessed with you.
[45:44.600 --> 45:45.600]  All right.
[45:45.600 --> 45:46.600]  I'm going to be honest.
[45:46.600 --> 45:49.600]  I'm going to be, as a Megan, knock it off.
[45:49.600 --> 45:51.600]  I mean, it was literally worse than college being at a topless bar
[45:51.600 --> 45:54.600]  when they're trying to get you to pay for a table dance.
[45:54.600 --> 45:55.600]  It was so fake.
[45:55.600 --> 46:00.600]  I was like, sweetheart, sweetheart, why do you hear all this?
[46:00.600 --> 46:01.600]  I do.
[46:01.600 --> 46:08.600]  I want to go to dinner with you and I want to get a big juicy steak and a dessert.
[46:08.600 --> 46:20.600]  I mean, this is sensational, but you'll never hear it on the news.
[46:20.600 --> 46:23.600]  Because they're controlled and they said we lost the election
[46:23.600 --> 46:26.600]  because we weren't big enough liars, because we weren't organized enough
[46:26.600 --> 46:31.600]  with the fake polls and giving the questions to Hillary for the debates.
[46:31.600 --> 46:38.600]  You know, we totally rigged it, but we spent too much time spirit-cooking
[46:38.600 --> 46:43.600]  and devil-worshipping, having the kids delivered to the hot tub.
[46:43.600 --> 46:46.600]  We've got to spend more time destroying and getting meaner
[46:46.600 --> 46:50.600]  and saying kill Trump and kill congressmen and then having the post-writers go,
[46:50.600 --> 46:53.600]  too bad it wasn't larger or more organized.
[46:53.600 --> 46:55.600]  Wolf Blitzer has a guest on.
[46:55.600 --> 46:57.600]  So this man wasn't a monster and he was just tired of things.
[46:57.600 --> 46:59.600]  Wolf Blitzer, OK, thanks for your view.
[46:59.600 --> 47:00.600]  Very interesting.
[47:00.600 --> 47:03.600]  What happens, Wolf Blitzer, when somebody pumps rounds into your little pumpkin head
[47:03.600 --> 47:08.600]  and says, it's just political?
[47:08.600 --> 47:12.600]  You people, you guys better have some helicopter jump jets
[47:12.600 --> 47:18.600]  and be ready to get out of here real quick if the actual Civil War kicks off.
[47:18.600 --> 47:20.600]  I mean, I'm not the one that's calling for violence.
[47:20.600 --> 47:23.600]  You're going to get wrecked bad.
[47:23.600 --> 47:27.600]  There are a lot of people like Santa Claus been making a list,
[47:27.600 --> 47:29.600]  been checking in twice by who's been naughty and nice,
[47:29.600 --> 47:32.600]  and you kick off Civil War, too, baby.
[47:32.600 --> 47:38.600]  You'll think Lexington and Concord was a cakewalk.
[47:38.600 --> 47:39.600]  But you never listen.
[47:39.600 --> 47:40.600]  You've never been in fights.
[47:40.600 --> 47:42.600]  That's the weird thing about globalists is their,
[47:42.600 --> 47:48.600]  their minions are all like super wimpy, candy ass fobs,
[47:48.600 --> 47:49.600]  but they play World of Warcraft.
[47:49.600 --> 47:50.600]  I guess they feel powerful.
[47:50.600 --> 47:53.600]  And they just talk about how they're going to kill people all the time
[47:53.600 --> 47:56.600]  and how they're going to murder us and how our kids belong to them.
[47:56.600 --> 47:59.600]  And ha, ha, ha, the sky rise burned down.
[47:59.600 --> 48:03.600]  Dirk and Dirk and Mohammed Jihad and, you know, just on and on and on
[48:03.600 --> 48:06.600]  and everyone rolls over to it.
[48:06.600 --> 48:09.600]  And I am sick of it.
[48:09.600 --> 48:12.600]  Before we go any further, I'm going to come back and get into some
[48:12.600 --> 48:13.600]  of these outrageous clips.
[48:13.600 --> 48:15.600]  We've got a bunch of guests joining us to talk about the Civil War.
[48:15.600 --> 48:17.600]  The Democrats are openly kicking off.
[48:17.600 --> 48:19.600]  But here's the deal.
[48:19.600 --> 48:22.600]  We're getting more traffic than we've ever had in the summer.
[48:22.600 --> 48:25.600]  Not as big as it was election week, but it's, it's close.
[48:25.600 --> 48:28.600]  And we're getting a lot of support, but obviously we're under mega attack.
[48:28.600 --> 48:30.600]  And they got lots of other stuff lined up, the pipeline,
[48:30.600 --> 48:34.600]  but we've got operations that will hold them off for at least four years
[48:34.600 --> 48:40.600]  at our current attack profile unless they kill me.
[48:40.600 --> 48:43.600]  And I'm not giving them some, you know, code they didn't already have.
[48:43.600 --> 48:47.600]  That's the only code that works in their operation.
[48:47.600 --> 48:51.600]  They can't kill my name or your name because, you know, they're a bunch of liars.
[48:51.600 --> 48:52.600]  They can't get to you.
[48:52.600 --> 48:53.600]  They can't break you.
[48:53.600 --> 48:56.600]  And they know that they can't stand it.
[48:56.600 --> 48:58.600]  They don't want to make me a martyr, but if they could demonize me enough
[48:58.600 --> 49:04.600]  that have some angry person do it, you know, like, like, like a family member
[49:04.600 --> 49:08.600]  of a slain child, you can see the whole PR thing.
[49:08.600 --> 49:13.600]  Very upset I canceled the view and aren't coming to New York.
[49:13.600 --> 49:16.600]  You don't think we have people that are jacked into everything
[49:16.600 --> 49:20.600]  and don't know what you're up to?
[49:20.600 --> 49:24.600]  Should I publish the directive from a U.S. agency
[49:24.600 --> 49:28.600]  in countervalence of the president out of the State Department,
[49:28.600 --> 49:31.600]  the Board of Governors of the FCC and the Central Intelligence Agency
[49:31.600 --> 49:36.600]  ordering everyone not to actually play clips or what I say?
[49:36.600 --> 49:41.600]  Maybe we'll release that in the next hour.
[49:41.600 --> 49:44.600]  But you just think it's only red coats in this fight.
[49:44.600 --> 49:46.600]  You don't think there aren't minute men.
[49:46.600 --> 49:49.600]  What you just think in the universe, you just pound the children in a boredom
[49:49.600 --> 49:53.600]  and kill them in devil worship and open the borders and bring in disease
[49:53.600 --> 49:56.600]  and pound us in the face forever and no one ever stands up.
[49:56.600 --> 49:57.600]  No one ever fights back.
[49:57.600 --> 49:59.600]  Oh, yes, that's what's happening now.
[49:59.600 --> 50:02.600]  Get ready.

[50:54.600 --> 50:57.600]  Nobody seemed to know where John called home.
[50:57.600 --> 51:00.600]  He just drifted into town and stayed all alone.

[54:21.600 --> 54:28.600]  All right, Alex Jones here, back live.
[54:28.600 --> 54:30.600]  We've got a bunch of amazing guests coming up.
[54:30.600 --> 54:34.600]  I'm going to get into all the mainstream media outlets you name it,
[54:34.600 --> 54:38.600]  celebrating the congressman being shot, the cops being shot.
[54:38.600 --> 54:42.600]  I got stacks of it here and they're like, it's time for violence.
[54:42.600 --> 54:46.600]  Even CNN's like, you know, having guests on there saying, you know,
[54:46.600 --> 54:54.600]  what an evil man took action. Too bad, though, that what more coordinated.
[54:54.600 --> 54:58.600]  That's who they are. They've demonized us. They're delusionals.
[54:58.600 --> 55:02.600]  You look at the profile of the average liberal. They don't work. They're stupid.
[55:02.600 --> 55:06.600]  They're hateful. They want to tell others how to live.
[55:06.600 --> 55:11.600]  They're not compatible in our free society. They're out live with radical Islam.
[55:11.600 --> 55:15.600]  I mean, look at these clips. I've got so many of these like Don Lemon saying,
[55:15.600 --> 55:18.600]  don't admit he's an actor and he's fake.
[55:18.600 --> 55:23.600]  No, my ex-wife was in a court hearing playing a clip or trying to get a clip
[55:23.600 --> 55:28.600]  entered of me as a joker doing a joker character saying, take, you know,
[55:28.600 --> 55:32.600]  take your fluoride and Prozac kids, it'll eat your brains.
[55:32.600 --> 55:35.600]  Obviously doing satire saying, don't take prozac, don't drink fluoride.
[55:35.600 --> 55:38.600]  And my lawyer goes, that's like being an actor there.
[55:38.600 --> 55:41.600]  Jack Nicholson isn't really the joker.
[55:41.600 --> 55:46.600]  So see, that's how they play these games is their cover or their excuse.
[55:46.600 --> 55:48.600]  I've got that clip. There's so many of these, but listen to this.
[55:48.600 --> 55:52.600]  Fox News compares Alex Jones to murderers and rapists.
[55:52.600 --> 55:55.600]  And they're like, well, you know, she should be able to interview whoever she wants.
[55:55.600 --> 55:58.600]  I mean, we interview murderers and rapists and the despicable things.
[55:58.600 --> 56:02.600]  Jones says how he hates the little kids that died in Newtown. Never said that.
[56:02.600 --> 56:05.600]  I just said, my listeners are like, we don't believe it. You see this anomaly.
[56:05.600 --> 56:10.600]  And I said, I said, yeah, they said babies died in incubators and got their brains bashed out.
[56:10.600 --> 56:14.600]  That's fake. So they'll do anything. I'm not saying that case wasn't real or not,
[56:14.600 --> 56:19.600]  but we can legitimately then question every event as if it's fake because we have a history of that.
[56:19.600 --> 56:24.600]  Common sense, two plus two equals four.
[56:24.600 --> 56:31.600]  But they want to bully you and say, if you try to stand up and speak out, we'll destroy you.
[56:31.600 --> 56:35.600]  Got news for you MSM, never had more traffic, never had more support.
[56:35.600 --> 56:37.600]  You're that pathetic.
[56:37.600 --> 56:42.600]  People are going to ask, who is this guy that is as bad as Saddam Hussein,
[56:42.600 --> 56:47.600]  who's on every channel, but you won't show what he said or you'll edit it.
[56:47.600 --> 56:49.600]  Here's that clip.
[56:49.600 --> 56:54.600]  The interview itself hasn't even aired yet. They just played an excerpt on Sunday night.
[56:54.600 --> 56:59.600]  And already, well, the flames are being fanned here.
[56:59.600 --> 57:04.600]  That's what's so striking here about this controversy involving our former Fox News colleague,
[57:04.600 --> 57:07.600]  Megan Kelly, is that nobody has seen the full interview.
[57:07.600 --> 57:11.600]  And look, what we have here is a classic collision because one can, you know,
[57:11.600 --> 57:17.600]  you cannot be moved by listening to some of these Sandwich parents and how they think that Alex Jones should not get a platform.
[57:17.600 --> 57:24.600]  At the same time, he is somebody who President Trump called after the election to thank him for his role.
[57:24.600 --> 57:27.600]  Trump had gone on his radio show during the campaign.
[57:27.600 --> 57:35.600]  Not so much that NBC is creating or elevating Alex Jones as it is reflecting the fact that he is an influential guy.
[57:35.600 --> 57:40.600]  But look, over the years, John, as you know, journalists have interviewed murderers and rapists and child molesters.
[57:40.600 --> 57:44.600]  I mean, the anchors have interviewed Saddam Hussein, Charles Manson, O.J. Simpson.
[57:44.600 --> 57:46.600]  So this is part of what we do.
[57:46.600 --> 57:51.600]  The test will be, is it an aggressive interview in which the person is pressed to explain,
[57:51.600 --> 57:55.600]  is held to account for some of the outrageous things in this case that he has said,
[57:55.600 --> 57:58.600]  or is it more of a passive interview where you are just kind of giving them a free pass?
[57:58.600 --> 58:03.600]  And I think we can't really answer that question until we see the full interview on her Sunday night magazine show.
[58:03.600 --> 58:04.600]  That's right.
[58:04.600 --> 58:10.600]  And they're setting a precedent to say they can just ban someone from the airwaves or being interviewed.
[58:10.600 --> 58:13.600]  That's like old Soviet Russia or communist China today.
[58:13.600 --> 58:15.600]  It's just ridiculous.
[58:15.600 --> 58:20.600]  And again, you've got families that have been manipulated through their pain to be political operatives,
[58:20.600 --> 58:26.600]  to sue Bushmaster and go after the Second Amendment and blame American gun owners for what happened at Newtown,
[58:26.600 --> 58:30.600]  who are now political operatives, trying to go after the First Amendment too.
[58:30.600 --> 58:32.600]  And it's very, very sad.
[58:32.600 --> 58:34.600]  You know, I didn't kill your children.
[58:34.600 --> 58:36.600]  You know, it's that simple.
[58:36.600 --> 58:38.600]  I'm very, very, very sad that that happened.
[58:38.600 --> 58:42.600]  And I'm sad that the government lies so much that people don't question things.
[58:42.600 --> 58:44.600]  But that's the truth.
[58:44.600 --> 58:48.600]  And you can't suppress my speech.
[58:48.600 --> 58:55.600]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing
[58:55.600 --> 58:59.600]  to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[58:59.600 --> 59:04.600]  That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[59:04.600 --> 59:06.600]  It's made in the USA.
[59:06.600 --> 59:11.600]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body
[59:11.600 --> 59:13.600]  and it supports the informal war.
[59:13.600 --> 59:15.600]  It is a classical 360-win.
[59:15.600 --> 59:18.600]  It is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year.
[59:18.600 --> 59:24.600]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[59:24.600 --> 59:29.600]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world
[59:29.600 --> 59:34.600]  that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be
[59:34.600 --> 59:39.600]  because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the next level
[59:39.600 --> 59:41.600]  and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[59:41.600 --> 59:44.600]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[59:44.600 --> 59:48.600]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield and InfowarsLive.com.
[1:00:14.600 --> 1:00:16.600]  Alex Jones.
[1:00:32.600 --> 1:00:38.600]  Congressman Scalise, who is still in critical condition after being shot by a foaming at the mouth Democrat,
[1:00:38.600 --> 1:00:46.600]  a superfan of Rachel Maddow, he had been really pushing Trump and really quarterbacking
[1:00:46.600 --> 1:00:51.600]  as the number three ranking Republican in the House to go after the child porn rings,
[1:00:51.600 --> 1:00:54.600]  the child kidnapping rings, and he was dialed in with the patriots
[1:00:54.600 --> 1:00:58.600]  and U.S. intelligence agencies, that civil war going on to fight it.
[1:00:58.600 --> 1:01:03.600]  And the word is that's now being looked into that this was targeted.
[1:01:03.600 --> 1:01:06.600]  Thank God Senator Paul wasn't killed or shot.
[1:01:06.600 --> 1:01:09.600]  This is amazing. Again, I've got a stack of news.
[1:01:09.600 --> 1:01:15.600]  I mean, it's all over Infowars.com where they are having the post writers are saying,
[1:01:15.600 --> 1:01:20.600]  it's time for more action. I mean, it's just crazy.
[1:01:20.600 --> 1:01:25.600]  I'm going to go over all this today. It is just amazing. These people are crazy.
[1:01:25.600 --> 1:01:30.600]  And they really believe we all deserve to die.
[1:01:30.600 --> 1:01:35.600]  And a lot of people through Stockholm syndrome, through peer pressure, are kind of bowing to this.
[1:01:35.600 --> 1:01:39.600]  Just like they had fake polls against Trump where he was 15 points behind,
[1:01:39.600 --> 1:01:41.600]  he was really 15, 20 points ahead.
[1:01:41.600 --> 1:01:47.600]  They had the Australian Prime Minister in a closed event that the Aussies have had
[1:01:47.600 --> 1:01:49.600]  for over 100 years where you remember the government get drunk.
[1:01:49.600 --> 1:01:53.600]  It's a famous speech ball. And he got drunk and got up there.
[1:01:53.600 --> 1:01:57.600]  That's the Aussies. You got to love them. That is the Texans.
[1:01:57.600 --> 1:02:02.600]  And made jokes about Trump and about how the polls are fake.
[1:02:02.600 --> 1:02:05.600]  And they go, oh, look, the Prime Minister hates him.
[1:02:05.600 --> 1:02:07.600]  Well, it was obviously good natured fun.
[1:02:07.600 --> 1:02:17.600]  But what I'm saying is everything's twisted. Everything's a lie.
[1:02:17.600 --> 1:02:20.600]  So I'm going to be getting to that in the next segment.
[1:02:20.600 --> 1:02:24.600]  And then we have former Navy SEAL Patriot bestselling author.
[1:02:24.600 --> 1:02:29.600]  There's been warning of the leftist get ready to launch a major civil war.
[1:02:29.600 --> 1:02:32.600]  He's been coming on several years, warning of it. He's joining us.
[1:02:32.600 --> 1:02:35.600]  And then we got popping in Dr. Corsi in studio.
[1:02:35.600 --> 1:02:38.600]  Greg Sawyer retired Navy SEAL.
[1:02:38.600 --> 1:02:41.600]  Then in all the major groups that group you name it,
[1:02:41.600 --> 1:02:45.600]  he's going to be on with us talking about the child kidnapping rings that he and his team are.
[1:02:45.600 --> 1:02:48.600]  And that's getting right now than John Rappaport in the fourth hour.
[1:02:48.600 --> 1:02:56.600]  But they are now attacking me like I am a guy that got caught with 10 dead kids in his basement.
[1:02:56.600 --> 1:03:00.600]  Because they're the people that backed the government and the groups that are involved in that.
[1:03:00.600 --> 1:03:05.600]  I mean, this is the big, evil, demonic, vampiric, globalist spider coming out of its hole.
[1:03:05.600 --> 1:03:08.600]  Then Don Lemon, you know, is at the airport.
[1:03:08.600 --> 1:03:11.600]  And nobody, I was showing this to my family this morning, they go, who's that?
[1:03:11.600 --> 1:03:14.600]  Shannon has almost no viewers, a couple hundred thousand on average.
[1:03:14.600 --> 1:03:18.600]  You know, talk about how I admit I'm fake and he doesn't want to build me up
[1:03:18.600 --> 1:03:20.600]  and he doesn't want to give me too much attention.
[1:03:20.600 --> 1:03:24.600]  Like, he's this royalty that besides who doesn't.
[1:03:24.600 --> 1:03:26.600]  Now here's that clip.
[1:03:28.600 --> 1:03:32.600]  You see all this backlash going on with Megan Kelly, okay?
[1:03:32.600 --> 1:03:36.600]  You know, do you think it's fair that people are saying, you know,
[1:03:36.600 --> 1:03:40.600]  she's giving Alex Jones a platform, you know, by putting...
[1:03:40.600 --> 1:03:42.600]  Giving me a platform in the break.
[1:03:42.600 --> 1:03:43.600]  Do I think it's fair?
[1:03:43.600 --> 1:03:45.600]  Yeah, I mean, in such a negative way, you know.
[1:03:45.600 --> 1:03:48.600]  Well, I mean, I think that people can react the way that they want.
[1:03:48.600 --> 1:03:51.600]  I understand the position she's in, you know.
[1:03:51.600 --> 1:03:54.600]  She can have the highest rating she's ever had, just like Joe Rogan did when I was on.
[1:03:54.600 --> 1:03:56.600]  I like giving people like Alex Jones.
[1:03:56.600 --> 1:03:57.600]  Highest ever, dum-dum.
[1:03:57.600 --> 1:03:59.600]  What do you do? He's out there.
[1:03:59.600 --> 1:04:03.600]  I know how hard it is that sometimes you don't want to give people a platform,
[1:04:03.600 --> 1:04:11.600]  but then I think that part of the business of journalism is shining light in dark places
[1:04:11.600 --> 1:04:14.600]  and that's not always where places people like.
[1:04:14.600 --> 1:04:16.600]  Right, right, right.
[1:04:16.600 --> 1:04:19.600]  But for someone, honestly, for someone like Alex Jones,
[1:04:19.600 --> 1:04:23.600]  I'd rather not give him a platform because he's already admitted that he doesn't believe what he says.
[1:04:23.600 --> 1:04:25.600]  Right, the whole Sandy Hook thing, and then...
[1:04:25.600 --> 1:04:27.600]  Well, the Sandy Hook thing is disgusting.
[1:04:27.600 --> 1:04:29.600]  Oh, it's disgusting.
[1:04:29.600 --> 1:04:33.600] ...for his divorce that he doesn't believe in what he's saying and he's playing a character.
[1:04:33.600 --> 1:04:37.600]  Oh, Lemon's so good. All these wars, all the corruption, all the stuff that's being covered up,
[1:04:37.600 --> 1:04:39.600]  kids being hurt, I'm so bad.
[1:04:39.600 --> 1:04:42.600]  Like my listeners, I didn't just buy him the official story
[1:04:42.600 --> 1:04:44.600]  when governments have been caught ringing things so much,
[1:04:44.600 --> 1:04:47.600]  and I admit I'm faking court documents.
[1:04:47.600 --> 1:04:51.600]  When they're playing clubs to me in a lizard outfit of the Joker,
[1:04:51.600 --> 1:04:55.600]  going, look, he's insane, and my lawyer goes, it's a skit, he's acting.
[1:04:55.600 --> 1:04:58.600]  That doesn't mean I'm an actor in what I believe.
[1:04:58.600 --> 1:05:03.600]  A team of global warming scientists were forced to cancel an Arctic trip due to extreme ice conditions,
[1:05:03.600 --> 1:05:06.600]  which highlights how the advocacy against man-made climate change
[1:05:06.600 --> 1:05:08.600]  is actually a global scheme to weaken the U.S. economy.
[1:05:08.600 --> 1:05:11.600]  A group of 40 scientists were onboard the Amlundson,
[1:05:11.600 --> 1:05:13.600]  a research ship known for its ice-breaking capabilities,
[1:05:13.600 --> 1:05:16.600]  but this time the ice proved too thick for the ship to break through safely.
[1:05:16.600 --> 1:05:20.600]  Right on cue, one of the researchers blamed the ice on man-made climate change,
[1:05:20.600 --> 1:05:23.600]  but notice how it's typically government-funded scientists and politicians
[1:05:23.600 --> 1:05:25.600]  who are pushing the climate change agenda.
[1:05:25.600 --> 1:05:28.600]  Despite the fact that historically, the biggest flutter in the world is the government.
[1:05:28.600 --> 1:05:31.600]  You see, the globalists harped the dangers of man-made climate change,
[1:05:31.600 --> 1:05:34.600]  which they renamed from global warming once the data didn't fit their agenda,
[1:05:34.600 --> 1:05:37.600]  to push for carbon taxes and carbon currencies
[1:05:37.600 --> 1:05:40.600]  that allowed them to subjugate the U.S. by impoverishing Americans
[1:05:40.600 --> 1:05:42.600]  through a new technocratic form of colonialism.
[1:05:42.600 --> 1:05:45.600]  The globalists don't want independent nation-states with strong economies.
[1:05:45.600 --> 1:05:48.600]  They want unelected, super-regional governments like the EU,
[1:05:48.600 --> 1:05:51.600]  consisting of member states that are subordinate to the globalist-controlled economy,
[1:05:51.600 --> 1:05:55.600]  driven by multinational banks and other unelected global bodies.

[1:06:27.600 --> 1:06:56.600]  This is Kid Daniels reporting.
[1:06:58.600 --> 1:07:02.600]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide,
[1:07:02.600 --> 1:07:07.600]  while also enjoying what I have found to be the best-tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[1:07:07.600 --> 1:07:12.600]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico,
[1:07:12.600 --> 1:07:16.600]  where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[1:07:16.600 --> 1:07:21.600]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[1:07:21.600 --> 1:07:28.600]  If you want to discover and try a bag of the Patriot blend, 100% organic coffee at infowarslife.com.

[1:07:33.600 --> 1:07:35.600]  that so many other coffees give me personally.
[1:07:35.600 --> 1:07:37.600]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee.
[1:07:37.600 --> 1:07:42.600]  And it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[1:07:42.600 --> 1:07:46.600]  Dropped by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[1:07:46.600 --> 1:07:50.600]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.

[1:08:16.600 --> 1:08:19.600]  Alright, I have a stack of mainstream news articles here.
[1:08:19.600 --> 1:08:26.600]  Where the left is celebrating the shooting of Congressman Steve Scalise,
[1:08:26.600 --> 1:08:29.600]  who was the number three Republican in the House,
[1:08:29.600 --> 1:08:33.600]  a good friend of Trump, and a guy that was really pushing hard for America,
[1:08:33.600 --> 1:08:35.600]  and the restoration of our Republic.
[1:08:35.600 --> 1:08:39.600]  And the word is, from my sources, and it's also in the news,
[1:08:39.600 --> 1:08:41.600]  is that this was coordinated.
[1:08:41.600 --> 1:08:43.600]  This was a plan.
[1:08:43.600 --> 1:08:47.600]  They used a wind-up toy, basic, you know, leftist Bernie Sanders,
[1:08:47.600 --> 1:08:50.600]  mental patient, communist to do this.
[1:08:50.600 --> 1:08:53.600]  And I mean, just this weekend in Austin, they had communists with their guns,
[1:08:53.600 --> 1:08:56.600]  with their fingers on the triggers, threatening everybody.
[1:08:56.600 --> 1:08:58.600]  I mean, they are getting ready to make their move,
[1:08:58.600 --> 1:09:02.600]  just like our next guest, Matt Bracken, former Navy SEAL terrorism expert,
[1:09:02.600 --> 1:09:05.600]  and of course, best-selling author, to be breaking down.
[1:09:05.600 --> 1:09:12.600]  But shot Congressman Representative Steve Scalise was actively seeking to stop pedophilia.
[1:09:12.600 --> 1:09:15.600]  He had come out and said, human trafficking is easy as ordering a pizza.
[1:09:15.600 --> 1:09:18.600]  That's code word to us, letting us know he knows.
[1:09:18.600 --> 1:09:24.600]  It's over 10,000 arrests of pedophiles, several thousand that had kids in cages.
[1:09:24.600 --> 1:09:30.600]  Hundreds in LA, hundreds, I mean, hundreds in San Francisco, any major city, hundreds.
[1:09:30.600 --> 1:09:34.600]  You've got the whole playpin thing with 150,000 pedophiles.
[1:09:34.600 --> 1:09:36.600]  That's why there's a civil war inside the FBI,
[1:09:36.600 --> 1:09:38.600]  because the FBI is actually trying to do something about it.
[1:09:38.600 --> 1:09:44.600]  This is how they control people. This is a deep state operation.
[1:09:44.600 --> 1:09:49.600]  So we now have Scalise, we learned weeks ago, was coming out saying we're going after the pedophiles.
[1:09:49.600 --> 1:09:51.600]  Then this happens. Here's the clip.
[1:09:51.600 --> 1:09:57.600]  One of America's greatest values is our strong belief in the inherent worth of every human life.
[1:09:57.600 --> 1:10:01.600]  Human trafficking is a direct assault on this core value,
[1:10:01.600 --> 1:10:04.600]  and it affects millions of victims throughout the world.
[1:10:04.600 --> 1:10:08.600]  While many of us would like to believe that this issue isn't something that affects us,
[1:10:08.600 --> 1:10:11.600]  the sad truth is that human trafficking is a real problem,
[1:10:11.600 --> 1:10:15.600]  plaguing each and every community here in the United States.
[1:10:15.600 --> 1:10:17.600]  Enough is enough.
[1:10:17.600 --> 1:10:22.600]  This week, the House took strong actions to stand up for the victims of human trafficking,
[1:10:22.600 --> 1:10:28.600]  passing tough bills to provide them protection, and to target child predators.
[1:10:28.600 --> 1:10:33.600]  Let's work together to get these bills signed into law.
[1:10:33.600 --> 1:10:38.600]  And there were over 400 pedophile arrests in his state just alone last year.
[1:10:38.600 --> 1:10:42.600]  Now, again, you've got Huffington Post Writers that's all up on infowars.com saying,
[1:10:42.600 --> 1:10:44.600]  you know, it's time for organized resistance.
[1:10:44.600 --> 1:10:48.600]  You've got other writers, major papers saying, you know, too bad there weren't more of this guy.
[1:10:48.600 --> 1:10:52.600]  He's a big super fan of Rachel Maddow.
[1:10:52.600 --> 1:10:54.600]  This is where this is all going.
[1:10:54.600 --> 1:10:56.600]  And then where's the false flag?
[1:10:56.600 --> 1:10:59.600]  That would fit nicely into their narrative to make themselves the victims.
[1:10:59.600 --> 1:11:01.600]  But I don't think they care.
[1:11:01.600 --> 1:11:04.600]  They have this weird bloodlust and they want a civil war.
[1:11:04.600 --> 1:11:08.600]  Huff Post Writers, violent resistance needs to be organized for it to work.
[1:11:08.600 --> 1:11:12.600]  Again, too bad, you know, only five people were shot.
[1:11:12.600 --> 1:11:14.600]  And, you know, Scalise is fighting for his life.
[1:11:14.600 --> 1:11:16.600]  This is a terrible situation.
[1:11:16.600 --> 1:11:19.600]  So, and I love how it's people that have never probably been in a fist fight.
[1:11:19.600 --> 1:11:21.600]  It's like the wimpier of the person.
[1:11:21.600 --> 1:11:23.600]  I've been around these libs in person.
[1:11:23.600 --> 1:11:25.600]  They look like they've had lobotomies.
[1:11:25.600 --> 1:11:27.600]  Seriously, I'm not being mean.
[1:11:27.600 --> 1:11:29.600]  They all have, like, motor function problems and stuff.
[1:11:29.600 --> 1:11:30.600]  I don't know what happened.
[1:11:30.600 --> 1:11:33.600]  They were, like, locked in a basement when they were kids, abused what?
[1:11:33.600 --> 1:11:34.600]  They want war.
[1:11:34.600 --> 1:11:36.600]  They want the right of passage.
[1:11:36.600 --> 1:11:38.600]  But they don't want to join the military to do it.
[1:11:38.600 --> 1:11:40.600]  They don't want to be a firefighter or a cop.
[1:11:40.600 --> 1:11:41.600]  They just want war.
[1:11:41.600 --> 1:11:42.600]  They want death.
[1:11:42.600 --> 1:11:43.600]  They want murder.
[1:11:43.600 --> 1:11:47.600]  And now, every channel, again, I'm worse, you know, than a killer.
[1:11:47.600 --> 1:11:48.600]  I'm like Saddam Hussein.
[1:11:48.600 --> 1:11:50.600]  They misrepresent what I've said.
[1:11:50.600 --> 1:11:53.600]  They write articles about resistance past, present, and future.
[1:11:53.600 --> 1:11:57.600]  How they're the resistance is the big banks and the multinationals all pile on
[1:11:57.600 --> 1:12:03.600]  against an attempt to just not completely gut and bankrupt the country.
[1:12:03.600 --> 1:12:05.600]  And so they're everywhere, condoning violence, pushing it.
[1:12:05.600 --> 1:12:06.600]  This is organized crime.
[1:12:06.600 --> 1:12:08.600]  This is racketeering.
[1:12:08.600 --> 1:12:11.600]  Matt Bracken, what do you make of the situation where we're currently at?
[1:12:11.600 --> 1:12:15.600]  Because you've been accurately predicting this, and they are really gearing up for it.
[1:12:15.600 --> 1:12:20.600]  And it's the craziest thing I've ever seen.
[1:12:20.600 --> 1:12:24.600]  Well, the left-wing mainstream media is absolutely instigating it.
[1:12:24.600 --> 1:12:30.600]  You can almost say stage managing it with the help from the Democrats in Congress.
[1:12:30.600 --> 1:12:38.600]  Gateway Pundit has a great story up today about the New York Times article in April 12th this year.
[1:12:38.600 --> 1:12:43.600]  I saw that yesterday where they advertised where they are and that there's not much security.
[1:12:43.600 --> 1:12:44.600]  Right.
[1:12:44.600 --> 1:12:51.600]  So for a guy like Hodgkesson who left Illinois as a killer, you know, he left Illinois to
[1:12:51.600 --> 1:12:56.600]  get in striking range of his enemies so that he can be the John Brown of the New Resistance,
[1:12:56.600 --> 1:12:58.600]  the John Brown of the New Civil War.
[1:12:58.600 --> 1:13:05.600]  Obviously, he would have no luck with a white van parked outside of the White House.
[1:13:05.600 --> 1:13:08.600]  But the New York Times handed him the information.
[1:13:08.600 --> 1:13:11.600]  This is where to go, where they'll have very minimal security.
[1:13:11.600 --> 1:13:17.600]  It said, you know, there may be some Capitol Police sitting in a black SUV at the ballpark.
[1:13:17.600 --> 1:13:23.600]  Well, that gives you another, you know, 350 degrees of a big fenced-in area away from
[1:13:23.600 --> 1:13:26.600]  the black SUV where you can take your shots from.
[1:13:26.600 --> 1:13:31.600]  So clearly he, I mean, I'm sure that if the FBI, they were doing their job, they would
[1:13:31.600 --> 1:13:36.600]  have a, you know, the cookies on his computers and his smartphones would show that he had
[1:13:36.600 --> 1:13:39.600]  read this article, probably, you know, saved the article.
[1:13:39.600 --> 1:13:44.600]  And that's why he was living at that YMCA out of his van, keeping an eye on that park.
[1:13:44.600 --> 1:13:48.600]  So the New York Times should get an assist on this hit.
[1:13:48.600 --> 1:13:50.600]  They absolutely should get credit for it.
[1:13:50.600 --> 1:13:51.600]  Sure.
[1:13:51.600 --> 1:13:53.600]  I mean, they were the intel office.
[1:13:53.600 --> 1:13:57.600]  And it's so ironic because the paragraph above the paragraph where it says, you know, that
[1:13:57.600 --> 1:14:03.600]  they are practicing at this field, it said, well, security officials are very cautious
[1:14:03.600 --> 1:14:08.600]  about giving out details because they, you know, say it could compromise security.
[1:14:08.600 --> 1:14:12.600]  And in the next paragraph, the New York Times says, you know, wink, wink.
[1:14:12.600 --> 1:14:16.600]  But if you, you know, if you really wanted to get a bunch of congressmen without much
[1:14:16.600 --> 1:14:18.600]  security, here's where you would do it.
[1:14:18.600 --> 1:14:23.600]  And sure enough, that's where Hodgson went to shoot these guys.
[1:14:23.600 --> 1:14:28.600]  What do you make of, of even CNN's Wolf Blitzer going to a person they interviewed.
[1:14:28.600 --> 1:14:31.600]  So it's, it's prepared and they admit they're going to this clip.
[1:14:31.600 --> 1:14:33.600]  And he says he wasn't a monster.
[1:14:33.600 --> 1:14:34.600]  He wasn't evil.
[1:14:34.600 --> 1:14:36.600]  You know, he just, he was just upset about politics.
[1:14:36.600 --> 1:14:39.600]  And then, and then Blitzer just pretty much agrees with him.
[1:14:39.600 --> 1:14:45.600]  I mean, don't they understand that if this kicks off, that they have really are asking
[1:14:45.600 --> 1:14:46.600]  for it.
[1:14:46.600 --> 1:14:49.600]  I mean, what is Blitzer going to do if somebody walks up, God forbid and pumps up rounds into
[1:14:49.600 --> 1:14:54.600]  his head when, when he's, and then just says, Hey, this is just sorry, Blitzer.
[1:14:54.600 --> 1:14:55.600]  It's just politics.
[1:14:55.600 --> 1:14:56.600]  No big deal.
[1:14:56.600 --> 1:14:57.600]  Well, it's, it's amazing.
[1:14:57.600 --> 1:15:01.600]  I mean, you know, CNN, we know what they are, but going back to the New York Times for a
[1:15:01.600 --> 1:15:05.600]  moment before we get to the Washington Post, the other, the other, you know, fingers of
[1:15:05.600 --> 1:15:07.600]  this machine.
[1:15:07.600 --> 1:15:11.600]  The New York Times today is blaming Sarah Palin for yesterday.
[1:15:11.600 --> 1:15:12.600]  That's right.
[1:15:12.600 --> 1:15:14.600]  They're going, they're going back to their, they weren't even crosshairs.
[1:15:14.600 --> 1:15:16.600]  They were surveyors marks.
[1:15:16.600 --> 1:15:21.600]  You know, the, the congressional district thing, uh, Lough, the guy down in Arizona, he was
[1:15:21.600 --> 1:15:26.600]  a lunatic that had been planning to kill like a Robert De Niro taxi driver kind of character.
[1:15:26.600 --> 1:15:27.600]  Sure.
[1:15:27.600 --> 1:15:29.600]  He took hallucinogens every day, according to his friends.
[1:15:29.600 --> 1:15:31.600]  It was in another world.
[1:15:31.600 --> 1:15:35.600]  And he had been planning it for years way before, you know, he didn't even know who Sarah Palin
[1:15:35.600 --> 1:15:36.600]  was.
[1:15:36.600 --> 1:15:37.600]  He was a devil worshipper.
[1:15:37.600 --> 1:15:38.600]  He was a devil worshipper.
[1:15:38.600 --> 1:15:40.600]  Had a devil worship alter in his backyard.
[1:15:40.600 --> 1:15:41.600]  Exactly.
[1:15:41.600 --> 1:15:45.600]  And I predicted this yesterday that they would blame the Gabby Griffords thing and say, oh,
[1:15:45.600 --> 1:15:46.600]  you Republicans do this.
[1:15:46.600 --> 1:15:49.600]  No, the difference is Republicans weren't saying go out and kill Democrats.
[1:15:49.600 --> 1:15:50.600]  That's the difference.
[1:15:50.600 --> 1:15:57.600]  And not only, not only that, imagine if Fox News or, or, uh, Breitbart or Infowars had done
[1:15:57.600 --> 1:16:01.600]  an article on Hillary Clinton's security.
[1:16:01.600 --> 1:16:06.600]  And in this article about Hillary Clinton's security mentioned, uh, let's say, you know,
[1:16:06.600 --> 1:16:10.600]  a tennis club she liked to go to with only a close friend.
[1:16:10.600 --> 1:16:11.600]  Exactly.
[1:16:11.600 --> 1:16:15.600]  Oh, here's where Hillary, you know, goes once a week to play bridge right here at the corner
[1:16:15.600 --> 1:16:16.600]  of this.
[1:16:16.600 --> 1:16:17.600]  There's not much security.
[1:16:17.600 --> 1:16:18.600]  There'll just be one car.
[1:16:18.600 --> 1:16:20.600]  So if you just come into the alley, you can get her right there.
[1:16:20.600 --> 1:16:21.600]  Right.
[1:16:21.600 --> 1:16:22.600]  So for the New York Times to blame Palin.
[1:16:22.600 --> 1:16:26.600]  Oh, let me stop because you're a former Navy SEAL and involved in clandestine operations
[1:16:26.600 --> 1:16:27.600]  in the Middle East and a lot of other areas.
[1:16:27.600 --> 1:16:28.600]  You know this.
[1:16:28.600 --> 1:16:29.600]  A lot of folks don't know this.
[1:16:29.600 --> 1:16:33.600]  Back in the Cold War, the, the, the Russians would have operatives in publication.
[1:16:33.600 --> 1:16:37.600]  So would we and would actually put orders in the paper.
[1:16:37.600 --> 1:16:40.600]  Well, this isn't even where, you know, this paragraph, that paragraph put it together.
[1:16:40.600 --> 1:16:44.600]  This is open commands in public that a five year old could tell.
[1:16:44.600 --> 1:16:48.600]  This is openly, uh, putting the Intel out there.
[1:16:48.600 --> 1:16:49.600]  Right.
[1:16:49.600 --> 1:16:50.600]  This is on a silver platter.
[1:16:50.600 --> 1:16:56.600]  This is saying all of the, all of you triggered lunatics since everybody from Nancy Pelosi
[1:16:56.600 --> 1:17:02.600]  and Chuck Schumer to the talking heads on ABC and NBCBS, New York times, Washington Post.
[1:17:02.600 --> 1:17:08.600]  All of these guys have been saying, Obamacare is being repealed repealed to kill people.
[1:17:08.600 --> 1:17:10.600]  They want to kill grandma.
[1:17:10.600 --> 1:17:12.600]  They want to kill your children.
[1:17:12.600 --> 1:17:19.600]  They're basically sending a signal to these lunatics by comparing Trump to Hitler on a daily basis.
[1:17:19.600 --> 1:17:20.600]  Sure.
[1:17:20.600 --> 1:17:23.600]  And then showing him being killed in plays and killed on TV and killed everywhere.
[1:17:23.600 --> 1:17:25.600]  Kill, kill, kill, kill.
[1:17:25.600 --> 1:17:29.600]  Historically though, I know there's a globalist and elites behind this that want to cause a civil war here.
[1:17:29.600 --> 1:17:33.600]  They're using known Soros tactics and others and it's admitted Soros is involved.
[1:17:33.600 --> 1:17:36.600]  They've got this big summer of rage geared up, kill the cops, kill everybody.
[1:17:36.600 --> 1:17:42.600]  But don't the little minions of this realize if it actually kicks off historically, it's not going to go well for them.
[1:17:42.600 --> 1:17:46.600]  I mean, I think they're really, really, really, really mistaken.
[1:17:46.600 --> 1:17:47.600]  No, they don't get it.
[1:17:47.600 --> 1:17:52.600]  You know, the leftists primarily are first level thinkers.
[1:17:52.600 --> 1:17:55.600]  They are like goldfish in a goldfish bowl.
[1:17:55.600 --> 1:18:01.600]  They realize that, you know, it gets dark and light at that window over there and food gets dumped in over here.
[1:18:01.600 --> 1:18:03.600]  They're first level thinkers.
[1:18:03.600 --> 1:18:08.600]  If you want to cure poverty, tax the rich and give money to poor people, that's how you cure poverty.
[1:18:08.600 --> 1:18:10.600]  Pure first level thinking.
[1:18:10.600 --> 1:18:19.600]  So the Wolf Blitzers of the world, which are not high IQ people, you know, they're just news readers, what they call them in England, news readers.
[1:18:19.600 --> 1:18:25.600]  They only are looking at this from the point of view of my bosses want to get rid of Trump.
[1:18:25.600 --> 1:18:28.600]  So they're handing me headlines to read to help get rid of Trump.
[1:18:28.600 --> 1:18:36.600]  They're not thinking, you know, if I'm helping to instigate a dirty war where we're doing a, you know, not just a dog whistle.
[1:18:36.600 --> 1:18:39.600]  This is like a cowbell for lunatics.
[1:18:39.600 --> 1:18:41.600]  Oh yeah, I mean, a lot of people, they're calling for violence.
[1:18:41.600 --> 1:18:44.600]  If this all kicks off, they're going to be up there with that helicopter ride to nowhere.
[1:18:44.600 --> 1:18:45.600]  Right.
[1:18:45.600 --> 1:18:55.600]  Or it's just going to be, you know, somebody like in my first novel where a couple of attorneys just have their own local, the senator that lives in their neighborhood pre-registered as a target.
[1:18:55.600 --> 1:19:05.600]  So there are a lot of people that have done their own, you know, local area target analysis that if the balloon goes up, these are some people that I'm going to take out.
[1:19:05.600 --> 1:19:08.600]  And I have no doubt that exists on both sides.
[1:19:08.600 --> 1:19:09.600]  Absolutely.
[1:19:09.600 --> 1:19:12.600]  But they're exactly, these people are crazy.
[1:19:12.600 --> 1:19:16.600]  And I'd say what about 90% of the veterans are on the republic side.
[1:19:16.600 --> 1:19:21.600]  And I think 90% of the police, correct me if I'm wrong, that is a disastrous scenario for these idiots.
[1:19:21.600 --> 1:19:22.600]  Not only that.
[1:19:22.600 --> 1:19:27.600]  So you've got current police, which means that they have the encoded radio frequencies.
[1:19:27.600 --> 1:19:37.600]  They can listen on a law enforcement scanner and break through the encryption because they're like, you know, deputy or part-time sheriffs, things like that.
[1:19:37.600 --> 1:19:42.600]  They've got former experience in Afghanistan and Iraq.
[1:19:42.600 --> 1:19:50.600]  So they know all about, you know, how to do coordinate search, how to do social network analysis to find the bomb maker that never touches the bomb.
[1:19:50.600 --> 1:19:51.600]  They know how to do this.
[1:19:51.600 --> 1:19:54.600]  And when this all kicks off, it's going to be mayhem.
[1:19:54.600 --> 1:19:56.600]  And these idiots on the left.
[1:19:56.600 --> 1:19:57.600]  Stay right there.
[1:19:57.600 --> 1:19:58.600]  They're going to cry for mommy.
[1:19:58.600 --> 1:20:01.600]  Are you happy washing your hands with harsh chemicals?
[1:20:01.600 --> 1:20:03.600]  Are you happy doing laundry with detergents?
[1:20:03.600 --> 1:20:07.600]  Are you happy paying high prices? Find your happiness with pure soap.

[1:21:55.600 --> 1:22:02.600]  Hi, this is Ron Paul, former congressman in Republican presidential candidate.
[1:22:02.600 --> 1:22:06.600]  I love these summer months because this is when I get to enjoy the fresh fruits and vegetables
[1:22:06.600 --> 1:22:10.600]  that are being harvested on small farms and in our backyards.
[1:22:10.600 --> 1:22:13.600]  We all look forward to garden tomatoes and corn on the cob.
[1:22:13.600 --> 1:22:17.600]  Don't you wish there was a better way to preserve their true taste and flavors?
[1:22:17.600 --> 1:22:20.600]  I'm here to tell you that there is a better way.
[1:22:20.600 --> 1:22:24.600]  It's by using the amazing home freeze dryer from Harvest Right.
[1:22:24.600 --> 1:22:28.600]  I have a Harvest Right freeze dryer and use it to preserve the foods I love.
[1:22:28.600 --> 1:22:33.600]  Strawberries, apples and even lasagna and ice cream can stay fresh for 25 years.
[1:22:33.600 --> 1:22:39.600]  And the best part of my freeze drying is my family and I have a supply of long-lasting food on hand.
[1:22:39.600 --> 1:22:42.600]  So no matter what may come, we feel better prepared.
[1:22:42.600 --> 1:22:44.600]  We love our freeze dryer.

[1:23:20.600 --> 1:23:26.600]  I'll be totally honest, I tried a different product and I wasn't happy with a different product.
[1:23:26.600 --> 1:23:53.600]  You guys are considerably cheaper than the other brands and I can really feel the difference.
[1:23:53.600 --> 1:24:02.600]  888-400-0435.
[1:24:02.600 --> 1:24:13.600]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[1:24:13.600 --> 1:24:23.600]  I don't want to make myself the center of the show but we are the second most attacked organization on the planet right now, more than Putin.
[1:24:23.600 --> 1:24:27.600]  Putin and Russia is now a third behind Imphal Wars.
[1:24:27.600 --> 1:24:33.600]  Trump is number one because we represent Christian sovereign nations.
[1:24:33.600 --> 1:24:35.600]  That's all. Doesn't mean Russia doesn't have a bunch of problems.
[1:24:35.600 --> 1:24:37.600]  Never been to Russia but I've studied it.
[1:24:37.600 --> 1:24:45.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, they are attacking me everywhere with this stupid Megan Kelly interview that's totally fake.
[1:24:45.600 --> 1:24:49.600]  Where she totally edited it, it's clear from the promo piece they put out.
[1:24:49.600 --> 1:24:51.600]  And Brad is going to write shotgun with me.
[1:24:51.600 --> 1:24:54.600]  Dr. Corsi is coming in here, round table discussion in the next segment.
[1:24:54.600 --> 1:25:01.600]  But here's an example, we've got the second biggest hack attack on Imphal Wars store.com.
[1:25:01.600 --> 1:25:05.600]  It's just a denial of service, it's a bunch of traffic, it doesn't mess with the security of the store.
[1:25:05.600 --> 1:25:15.600]  And we've got such giant servers that they're not slowing the site down but sometimes we have attacks that go on the sites for like a week and they're governmental.
[1:25:15.600 --> 1:25:28.600]  I mean some of these big IT companies and some of the biggest server companies out there, cloud companies tell us that one of these attacks that happened a few months ago was the biggest they'd ever seen and they're companies the second largest in the U.S.
[1:25:28.600 --> 1:25:36.600]  So they're demonizing us, they're attacking us, this is multinational corporations that have hijacked the U.S.
[1:25:36.600 --> 1:25:41.600]  We're trying to take it back, we're trying to stabilize the country, they're engaged in hardcore culture war.
[1:25:41.600 --> 1:25:44.600]  I mean watch Nickelodeon, man they're teaching five-year-olds how to give blowjobs.
[1:25:44.600 --> 1:25:47.600]  I mean it is just, this is psych warfare.
[1:25:47.600 --> 1:25:59.600]  Pedophile rings, you name it, they are sexualizing children everywhere, they are just pushing the most vile stuff on everybody as a culture war.
[1:25:59.600 --> 1:26:08.600]  And they use pedophilia that's being pushed in the schools and everywhere else, the sexualization you see on MTV everywhere, that's Viacom as well.
[1:26:08.600 --> 1:26:14.600]  They do all this to demoralize the public and then they use the pedophilia as a way to compromise people.
[1:26:14.600 --> 1:26:20.600]  And so that's why they're defending this so hard and why they're so scared because Trump is really making a run at him.
[1:26:20.600 --> 1:26:25.600]  As he said three years ago before he announced that he was going to run that he was going to try to take out the pedophiles.
[1:26:25.600 --> 1:26:34.600]  So Matt Bracken, former Navy SEAL author, EnemiesFar to Domestic.com's his website, The Gates of Vienna, also another great site he writes for.
[1:26:34.600 --> 1:26:37.600]  Matt, this is a short segment, longer segment coming up.
[1:26:37.600 --> 1:26:42.600]  Just as this fits in to them trying to start a civil war, we'll talk about that in the next segment.
[1:26:42.600 --> 1:26:50.600]  Why do you think info wars in yours truly is under such attack, but they won't really ever show what I said or it's edited.
[1:26:50.600 --> 1:26:55.600]  In fact, there's an order out in media, it's so controlled, never to actually show what I say.
[1:26:55.600 --> 1:27:01.600]  They're storing info wars.com where Hollywood reporter interviewed me and actually had quotes and then the higher ups killed it.
[1:27:01.600 --> 1:27:06.600]  And then I talked to other people in media and they said, no, you're not allowed now to even have quotes in the media.
[1:27:06.600 --> 1:27:14.600]  So it's next level control to that they're exercising in this weird civil war where we've got the president, we've got most of Congress.
[1:27:14.600 --> 1:27:23.600]  We got the states and the governors, but the deep state of bureaucracy, like I guess corrupt employees or something to tell the boss they're the owner now.
[1:27:23.600 --> 1:27:25.600]  I mean, this is a hijacking Matt Bracken.
[1:27:25.600 --> 1:27:41.600]  Well, it just shows that you're hitting them hard and there's a new paradigm of the great cartoonist Ben Garrison as a cartoon out the last few days or a week showing the new media asteroids coming down on the dinosaur media.
[1:27:41.600 --> 1:27:44.600]  And I mean, they're feeling it.
[1:27:44.600 --> 1:27:59.600]  This is the deep state's existential moment. If Trump succeeds, they're finished and a lot of people will go to prison. Not only Hillary and all of the people involved in her illegal top secret server, but these pedophile rings and you just go down the list.
[1:27:59.600 --> 1:28:03.600]  And hundreds murdered and fast and furious. The media helped cover it up.
[1:28:03.600 --> 1:28:15.600]  So the media have the blood of fast and furious on their hands, just as much as the ATF and the Department of Justice, Eric Holder, those people. So for them, this is an existential moment.
[1:28:15.600 --> 1:28:22.600]  So we're seeing right now a box move, like a trap that was built for Trump. And I don't see how he gets out of it.
[1:28:22.600 --> 1:28:35.600]  It's very going to be very difficult to get out of this where obviously it's now obvious to me that Rosenstein is part of this job was writing that letter to instigate the firing of Comey.
[1:28:35.600 --> 1:28:45.600]  And that's the trap being sprung. And so you've you've got Rosenstein saying that Mueller will not be taken off the case no matter what and that Trump can't do it.
[1:28:45.600 --> 1:28:55.600]  So you've got Comey, Mueller, Rosenstein and McCabe, they acting who's a, you know, the big Democrat. And they're violating the the Unitary Executive Clause that still is the law.
[1:28:55.600 --> 1:29:04.600]  Congress has usurped that with the FBI. It doesn't matter what they do. It doesn't matter what they do as long as they control the media narrative.
[1:29:04.600 --> 1:29:18.600]  You know, Alan Dershowitz, who is maybe one of the leading minds in a liberal Hillary voter, he's been clear on this, but it just doesn't matter. They're still running with this obstruction of justice narrative, even though there's a new crime.
[1:29:18.600 --> 1:29:25.600]  The Russian thing wasn't true. But just like they always the FBI always gets people, then in the investigation, they find a crooked toenail or something.
[1:29:25.600 --> 1:29:28.600]  And so that's going to claim that the president ordered it to stop.
[1:29:28.600 --> 1:29:37.600]  Yeah, that's the Martha Stewart paradigm. There was no crime. So they got her for, you know, things and untruth about a crime that never happened or something.
[1:29:37.600 --> 1:29:59.600]  And they're so arrogant that once they take Trump out, they plan to shut down the media, arrest people and have a red terror. Good luck, scum. I'll be back.
[1:30:07.600 --> 1:30:17.600]  MSNBC was caught trying to pretend that a former Obama campaign director was just a random woman on the street giving her opinion.
[1:30:17.600 --> 1:30:27.600]  And the fact that he would make a very specific request to have everybody else leave the office so that he would be alone with Comey, for me, speaks volumes.
[1:30:27.600 --> 1:30:37.600]  Well, it turns out that this random woman just happened to be political strategist Alma Marquez. But this is what we've all learned to expect from the establishment news media,
[1:30:37.600 --> 1:30:50.600]  where perhaps the worst reputation belongs to CNN, who has a long history of questionable news reporting, including the recent staged Muslim anti-terror protest,
[1:30:50.600 --> 1:31:00.600]  where you can clearly see host Becky Anderson directing the entire scene. And you can learn more right now at infowars.com.

[1:33:31.600 --> 1:33:43.600]  Alright, I need to spend a few minutes here fighting our operation. You can turn on any TV and see the corporate controlled media that's the enemy of the American people, the enemy of freedom, the enemy of families, the enemy of God.
[1:33:43.600 --> 1:33:49.600]  I mean, they're just, they're evil. They've chosen their side, and then once you choose evil, you just get worse and worse.
[1:33:49.600 --> 1:33:55.600]  Those of us that try to be good are actually ashamed of ourselves because we're not, you know, better because we have a conscience.
[1:33:55.600 --> 1:34:05.600]  But the globalists, they have been separated from God by their own choice and they are launching massive denial of service attacks on info wars and on our store.
[1:34:05.600 --> 1:34:11.600]  As of 30 minutes ago, it's not slowing it down so we can just keep unlimited servers being turned up and it's totally safe to order on there.
[1:34:11.600 --> 1:34:19.600]  They haven't hacked into it. They're just trying to shut it down, you know, like with big long lines at the door basically, but you can just go right around those lines.
[1:34:19.600 --> 1:34:25.600]  Whether it's tactical, nano tech body armor that's just available in the last six months to the public and infowarstore.com.
[1:34:25.600 --> 1:34:37.600]  Very inexpensive, amazing developed right here in Texas or super blue fluoride free toothpaste with loyal silver and iodine, 33% off with the 10 to one concentrated central oil.
[1:34:37.600 --> 1:34:42.600]  Amazing mouthwash that we have from Emmerich's Essentials. That's 33% off.
[1:34:42.600 --> 1:34:55.600]  You can also get brain force plus and info wars life.com are amazing. Neutropic, which is, I mean, really, we went out and saw what the top brands were that were the highest rated produce something similar for a third the price.
[1:34:55.600 --> 1:35:09.600]  I mean, that's what we do. Okay, like knock out 19 bucks for a bottle of melatonin. We have the same dose for $19 with eight other things like L trip to fan and valerian root and lemon balm and chamomile to give you the best sleep out there.
[1:35:09.600 --> 1:35:17.600]  Amazing. Check that out as to the new Z shield that's shellogy and a bunch of other key compounds.
[1:35:17.600 --> 1:35:25.600]  Literally just pulls the heavy metals and toxins out of the body from the research is there that I've done. Look it up yourself. It goes after the pesticides, the other garbage.
[1:35:25.600 --> 1:35:31.600]  So it's there. Go check out what's in the Z shield for yourself. Again, it's got the zeolites. It's got the shellogy.
[1:35:31.600 --> 1:35:40.600]  That's our newest product. Amazing detoxer. We also have the natural defense parasite cleanse.
[1:35:40.600 --> 1:35:53.600]  That is back in stock. That's been sold out for a long time. It is an act of war against the globalist to spread our links to spread our videos to pray for us to support our local affiliates and their sponsors and to purchase living
[1:35:53.600 --> 1:36:07.600]  defense and other products from infowarstore.com or call toll free triple a two five three three one three nine. I mean the very mouth of the new world order is saying destroy us lying about us misrepresenting what we say constantly.
[1:36:07.600 --> 1:36:21.600]  We say globalist working with Islamists is carried out 9 11. There was a cover up. They say I say firefighters blew it up. No, that's not what I said. I say we should question these mass shooting sometimes because they've been caught doing false flags like babies and incubators and stuff in Iraq.
[1:36:21.600 --> 1:36:30.600]  That means that I'm a good guy, but the babies weren't getting killed in incubators. If they'll do that, they'll do other stuff. Everybody should look at that. Oh my gosh, I say I hate the kids at Newtown. None of it's true.
[1:36:30.600 --> 1:36:41.600]  So what they do is they sit there and play games. They edit me. You see it everywhere. I double down on Newtown. According to the new, you know, video clip they've got out for days. It's the top story.
[1:36:41.600 --> 1:36:55.600]  And I didn't say that it was all edited. So this is what they do. And Megan Kelly said it wouldn't be a hit piece. We have the clips of her. I'm going to shoot a video today about this. It'll be on info wars.com later today where I break it all down and play clips of Megan Kelly lying to me.
[1:36:55.600 --> 1:37:00.600]  And I did it to protect myself so I could show what she really did.
[1:37:00.600 --> 1:37:13.600]  And what I really said. So again, biome defense is now back in stock. 50 billion live cultures we went out and got the top company in the nation to make the Rolls Royce probiotic is the pesticide to kill the good bacteria in your gut.
[1:37:13.600 --> 1:37:23.600]  This replaces it with the good ones. And they call it snake oil in the media that I sell a high quality refrigerated probiotic. This is totally documented science. It's not even debated. It's uncontrovertible.
[1:37:23.600 --> 1:37:32.600]  So there you go. They're so scared that you might fund a new economy that we might build something to resist their monopoly of lies when we have the truth.
[1:37:32.600 --> 1:37:54.600]  In full war store.com. And I forgot last hour to say this. I should be saying this at the start each time. Storewide free shipping. We rarely do that store wide free shipping. And if you sign up for auto ship on any item, it's an additional 10% off.
[1:37:54.600 --> 1:38:08.600]  But that's 25% off when you sign up for auto ship. And it's 20% off retail. It's a big national brand that allows us to private label it. That's how we get around them trying to boycott us and trying to shut down us having sponsors, which we can get.
[1:38:08.600 --> 1:38:14.600]  But why not just put out great products ourselves? See, that's how we do it. In full war store.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[1:38:14.600 --> 1:38:23.600]  Now, Dr. Corsi's ride the shotgun with me right into the next hour and co interviewing these great guests, Matt Bracken, former Navy SEAL best selling authors here. He has eerily.
[1:38:23.600 --> 1:38:34.600]  I only knew about this guy about two and a half years ago. People's smart folks said this is who you should be listening to. We can't give you a lot of classified info. Obviously, people still in the government, but this guy's on target with his analysis in the books he writes.
[1:38:34.600 --> 1:38:44.600]  So now I consider him a friend and a great guy here. Weather's predicting the false flag of everybody from the hubbing and post writers to you name it celebrating saying too bad it wasn't coordinated.
[1:38:44.600 --> 1:38:57.600]  Wolf Blitzer having a guy on saying this guy wasn't evil. He was just mad. I mean, Dr. Corsi, you've been saying they're preparing people for the president to be killed. They have they have this college of cowards feeling powerful together.
[1:38:57.600 --> 1:39:10.600]  I don't think they realize they lost the election. They miscalculated. Clearly, historically, they're going to lose if you look at the cultural topography, the sociology, the anthropology of America.
[1:39:10.600 --> 1:39:25.600]  They've taken libertarians, conservatives, veterans and others restraint as weakness as we have made a major preparation and information warfare to counter them with the truth while others have been making preparations to physically defend very decisively.
[1:39:25.600 --> 1:39:28.600]  Where would you say we are benchmark right now?
[1:39:28.600 --> 1:39:45.600]  Just at the very beginning, the left has not done their most shocking types of violence yet. I mean, I'm going to just go back to the left and remember, National Socialist Nazis were left, the Reichstag fire, all staged, burned down by Hitler.
[1:39:45.600 --> 1:39:47.600]  The French Revolution was the first left movement.
[1:39:47.600 --> 1:39:56.600]  Precisely. And the shocking violence is yet to occur. This violence is just a warm up. This is just the initial phase of the violence.
[1:39:56.600 --> 1:39:58.600]  They're probing.
[1:39:58.600 --> 1:40:13.600]  Yeah, but the violence is going to be planned, that is in the works, is going to be shocking, catastrophic and 9-11 type catastrophe, a blowing up of a national monument, some hugely important and disturbing.
[1:40:13.600 --> 1:40:16.600]  I think they might set a nuke off during the State of the Union.
[1:40:16.600 --> 1:40:22.600]  I'm not sure. I mean, anything you can imagine, the left, this is the Bill Ayers left.
[1:40:22.600 --> 1:40:34.600]  Let me ask you again, I understand he needs to fire all these people, take control, address the nation, we're in a civil crisis, they've started a war, start arresting some of the people that are organizing this in the media, show what they've done.
[1:40:34.600 --> 1:40:40.600]  I mean, I'm not a fascist guy. They're the ones calling for death and murder. They're the ones beating people up all over the country.
[1:40:40.600 --> 1:40:43.600]  I mean, we can't just sit here and take this.
[1:40:43.600 --> 1:40:45.600]  Well, let me explain a couple things in terms.
[1:40:45.600 --> 1:40:48.600]  Isn't it best for the president to launch the counter-strike?
[1:40:48.600 --> 1:40:52.600]  Okay, that's what he's got to do next. Trump has got the counter-attack.
[1:40:52.600 --> 1:40:57.600]  Now, first of all, let's realize that, first, I'll give you an example.
[1:40:57.600 --> 1:41:03.600]  During the campaign, Trump was being pressed to release his taxes and he said, I'm not going to do it.
[1:41:03.600 --> 1:41:05.600]  Okay, and he said, here's why I'm not going to do it.
[1:41:05.600 --> 1:41:10.600]  I've already disclosed all my financial statements. That's much more revealing than my taxes.
[1:41:10.600 --> 1:41:15.600]  The issue went away. Okay, now, the issue's got to go away again.
[1:41:15.600 --> 1:41:18.600]  This whole idea that Trump, it's morphed.
[1:41:18.600 --> 1:41:23.600]  The Democrats, the far left, could not prove the Russian collusion, so they dropped it.
[1:41:23.600 --> 1:41:25.600]  It's morphed now into obstruction.
[1:41:25.600 --> 1:41:27.600]  You said this weeks ago.
[1:41:27.600 --> 1:41:29.600]  Yeah, and the obstruction, here's the deal with the obstruction.
[1:41:29.600 --> 1:41:34.600]  First of all, President Trump can't obstruct the Department of Justice.
[1:41:34.600 --> 1:41:38.600]  He can. He has the authority to order Mueller to be fired.
[1:41:38.600 --> 1:41:41.600]  He has the authority to order Mueller to stop investigating.
[1:41:41.600 --> 1:41:46.600]  The remedy is impeachment, and the Democrats know they can't impeach Trump.
[1:41:46.600 --> 1:41:49.600]  They don't have the votes in Congress. They don't control the committees.
[1:41:49.600 --> 1:41:51.600]  Impeachments out of the question.
[1:41:51.600 --> 1:41:58.600]  So what they're going to try to do is prolong this obstruction meme and try to get it to have legs,
[1:41:58.600 --> 1:42:01.600]  so that they have new things to talk about every day.
[1:42:01.600 --> 1:42:04.600]  If Trump just comes out and says, look, I'm going to take a hit for it.
[1:42:04.600 --> 1:42:06.600]  I'm going to fire Mueller. This is my authority.
[1:42:06.600 --> 1:42:08.600]  If you don't like it, impeach me.
[1:42:08.600 --> 1:42:11.600]  Go ahead. There's the Congress. Impeach me. Do it.
[1:42:11.600 --> 1:42:15.600]  Exactly. He can't sit there and let them make up their whole fake Russian era that's now failed
[1:42:15.600 --> 1:42:18.600]  and then make up obstruction when he's just been completely open,
[1:42:18.600 --> 1:42:21.600]  and then Comey admits he didn't order him to stop.
[1:42:21.600 --> 1:42:26.600]  And so they're just trying to find somebody else that will give false testimony now to cobble it together.
[1:42:26.600 --> 1:42:30.600]  Let me go to Matt Bracken on that, but let me also just add, here's Tom Brokaw.
[1:42:30.600 --> 1:42:33.600]  I want to get this clip, guys, if you don't already have it.
[1:42:33.600 --> 1:42:38.600]  Tom Brokaw slams Alex Jones. He says he is a racist.
[1:42:38.600 --> 1:42:42.600]  I mean, what the hell is this? Let me, I don't want to be selfish here,
[1:42:42.600 --> 1:42:44.600]  but I'm asking you because you're, you work for him for hours, you're in the middle of this.
[1:42:44.600 --> 1:42:45.600]  Right.
[1:42:45.600 --> 1:42:46.600]  And we know each other like 15, 16 years.
[1:42:46.600 --> 1:42:47.600]  Right.
[1:42:47.600 --> 1:42:49.600]  Why are they so after me? What is going on?
[1:42:49.600 --> 1:42:55.600]  Because Alex, the plan was that if Hillary won, you were going to be shut down.
[1:42:55.600 --> 1:42:59.600]  They'd already started the fake news meme that was out there.
[1:42:59.600 --> 1:43:06.600]  They were clearly going to say once they had control of the White House, that you were done.
[1:43:06.600 --> 1:43:07.600]  They were going to prosecute you.
[1:43:07.600 --> 1:43:10.600]  They were going to argue that you committed some kind of a crime.
[1:43:10.600 --> 1:43:13.600]  Oh yeah, we had that from the gesture department.
[1:43:13.600 --> 1:43:14.600]  They're going to shut you down.
[1:43:14.600 --> 1:43:15.600]  They'd investigate.
[1:43:15.600 --> 1:43:18.600]  And then you'd go on a bunch of other others would go.
[1:43:18.600 --> 1:43:24.600]  Anyone who is not in lockstep with the CIA funded media,
[1:43:24.600 --> 1:43:32.600]  who is not in lockstep with an operation mockingbird since the fifties type of the approved press,
[1:43:32.600 --> 1:43:35.600]  the CNN, New York Times.
[1:43:35.600 --> 1:43:39.600]  I mean, Tom Brokaw, known, you know, known operation mockingbird said,
[1:43:39.600 --> 1:43:43.600]  I am a pure and unadulterated racist, unalloyed.
[1:43:43.600 --> 1:43:45.600]  He said, I am a pure.
[1:43:45.600 --> 1:43:47.600]  In fact, let's just play this clip folks.
[1:43:47.600 --> 1:43:52.600]  You have to understand, I was told by the Trump administration when they were even in transition.
[1:43:52.600 --> 1:43:54.600]  And of course this came out.
[1:43:54.600 --> 1:43:59.600]  I was told days before that Nancy Pelosi was saying that I wanted to kill her and her daughter,
[1:43:59.600 --> 1:44:01.600]  and was demanding Loretta Lynch arrest me.
[1:44:01.600 --> 1:44:03.600]  She doesn't even know who the president is.
[1:44:03.600 --> 1:44:04.600]  She said, I'm not being mean.
[1:44:04.600 --> 1:44:05.600]  She literally a senile.
[1:44:05.600 --> 1:44:07.600]  Other congressmen think islands are floating.
[1:44:07.600 --> 1:44:10.600]  That's what's dangerous is these people are crazy.
[1:44:10.600 --> 1:44:11.600]  They're in power.
[1:44:11.600 --> 1:44:13.600]  There's a conspiracy against the Republic.
[1:44:13.600 --> 1:44:18.600]  But what's dangerous is they don't realize how crazy this is that they try to kill me or arrest me,
[1:44:18.600 --> 1:44:20.600]  because everybody sees what's going on.
[1:44:20.600 --> 1:44:23.600]  And then I was told, and then the day after, I didn't say it on air,
[1:44:23.600 --> 1:44:27.600]  Pelosi's daughter came out and said, Alex Jones is death-threading me.
[1:44:27.600 --> 1:44:30.600]  And imagine, I'm talking to the president's crew.
[1:44:30.600 --> 1:44:32.600]  They're going, yeah, they're trying to have you arrested right now.
[1:44:32.600 --> 1:44:34.600]  They're having meetings in the Justice Department.
[1:44:34.600 --> 1:44:39.600]  And the transitioning Attorney General's already telling them this is insane.
[1:44:39.600 --> 1:44:42.600]  The lawyers at the Justice Department told them no.
[1:44:42.600 --> 1:44:44.600]  And I'm telling you, they're so whacked out.
[1:44:44.600 --> 1:44:46.600]  They want to arrest me.
[1:44:46.600 --> 1:44:48.600]  They don't believe in the First Amendment.
[1:44:48.600 --> 1:44:52.600]  They don't want you to be broadcasting or me or any of it.
[1:44:52.600 --> 1:44:53.600]  But what is it?
[1:44:53.600 --> 1:44:54.600]  What is it that scares them so much?
[1:44:54.600 --> 1:44:55.600]  The guest, I think.
[1:44:55.600 --> 1:44:58.600]  And the fact that we know their game plan and that we're not.
[1:44:58.600 --> 1:44:59.600]  I mean, what is it?
[1:44:59.600 --> 1:45:00.600]  Matt Bracken?
[1:45:00.600 --> 1:45:01.600]  Matt?
[1:45:01.600 --> 1:45:02.600]  It's sheer desperation.
[1:45:02.600 --> 1:45:04.600]  They're cornered.
[1:45:04.600 --> 1:45:07.600]  Their fury is actually, in a way, a good sign.
[1:45:07.600 --> 1:45:12.600]  Because when they feel in control, you never see this desperation.
[1:45:12.600 --> 1:45:15.600]  You know, their hair is looking nice, the makeup.
[1:45:15.600 --> 1:45:17.600]  There's no sweat popping out.
[1:45:17.600 --> 1:45:18.600]  They're desperate.
[1:45:18.600 --> 1:45:19.600]  They're going to Megan Kelly.
[1:45:19.600 --> 1:45:20.600]  It's evident.
[1:45:20.600 --> 1:45:24.600]  In the last month, your name is not to even be spoken on TV.
[1:45:24.600 --> 1:45:25.600]  That's the new thing.
[1:45:25.600 --> 1:45:27.600]  Not even to mention your name.
[1:45:27.600 --> 1:45:33.600]  The new code for Alex Jones is a conspiracy theorist who is making millions of dollars
[1:45:33.600 --> 1:45:35.600]  by telling lies.
[1:45:35.600 --> 1:45:37.600]  That's at the new meme.
[1:45:37.600 --> 1:45:38.600]  That's going to be the show.
[1:45:38.600 --> 1:45:40.600]  And we do, quote, make millions to fund this.
[1:45:40.600 --> 1:45:42.600]  They make billions to fund their lies.
[1:45:42.600 --> 1:45:43.600]  We make millions to fund it.
[1:45:43.600 --> 1:45:49.600]  But Megan Kelly's sin, her overarching sin, was she broke the taboo.
[1:45:49.600 --> 1:45:52.600]  She was not only going to mention your name.
[1:45:52.600 --> 1:45:54.600]  She was going to put your face on television.
[1:45:54.600 --> 1:45:59.600]  And millions of people that have never heard of Alex Jones would have heard of you.
[1:45:59.600 --> 1:46:03.600]  So her sin was breaking this embargo and actually mentioning your name.
[1:46:03.600 --> 1:46:04.600]  But I think that's the setup.
[1:46:04.600 --> 1:46:07.600]  Because none of them ever, all of a sudden, a bunch called at the same time she called,
[1:46:07.600 --> 1:46:08.600]  like 50 outfits.
[1:46:08.600 --> 1:46:13.600]  I think they shut it up, then they're burning her, having the keg eating it too.
[1:46:13.600 --> 1:46:14.600]  Well, they're burning her.
[1:46:14.600 --> 1:46:19.600]  But her way of getting back into their good graces is to re-edit the four hours of footage
[1:46:19.600 --> 1:46:21.600]  to turn you into a monster.
[1:46:21.600 --> 1:46:22.600]  It's obvious.
[1:46:22.600 --> 1:46:25.600]  But they don't control the entire media anymore.
[1:46:25.600 --> 1:46:33.600]  Now, this morning, Trump sort of went on the attack talking about the pivot from Russian
[1:46:33.600 --> 1:46:35.600]  collusion to obstruction of justice.
[1:46:35.600 --> 1:46:37.600]  Yeah, let's get that clip, guys.
[1:46:37.600 --> 1:46:39.600]  It needs to go much further, though.
[1:46:39.600 --> 1:46:41.600]  He needs to say, how dare you, you liars.
[1:46:41.600 --> 1:46:43.600]  Hillary's in bed with the Russians and the Chinese.
[1:46:43.600 --> 1:46:44.600]  And now you make up collusion.
[1:46:44.600 --> 1:46:45.600]  You people want it.
[1:46:45.600 --> 1:46:50.600]  She needs to go after them with his bully pulpit now, not while they develop this case.
[1:46:50.600 --> 1:46:53.600]  And with specifics and a great specific.
[1:46:53.600 --> 1:46:54.600]  This is like...
[1:46:54.600 --> 1:46:55.600]  Let me ask you this though.
[1:46:55.600 --> 1:46:57.600]  What can the FBI agents do themselves?
[1:46:57.600 --> 1:46:58.600]  Because it's this paradigm thing.
[1:46:58.600 --> 1:47:02.600]  You go back to Cleon Scowles and all these guys that were good FBI guys.
[1:47:02.600 --> 1:47:04.600]  The FBI is too slow.
[1:47:04.600 --> 1:47:08.600]  When you're talking about what FBI agents can do, you're talking about months from now.
[1:47:08.600 --> 1:47:09.600]  The news cycle...
[1:47:09.600 --> 1:47:13.600]  I understand, but I'm saying it's this paradox where there's bad FBI on top.
[1:47:13.600 --> 1:47:16.600]  But then the rank and file people are patriots, generally.
[1:47:16.600 --> 1:47:17.600]  What do they do?
[1:47:17.600 --> 1:47:21.600]  What do government people do right now, watching the Civil War, knowing that...
[1:47:21.600 --> 1:47:25.600]  They would have to leak the investigation files that they've got on Hillary.
[1:47:25.600 --> 1:47:26.600]  That's what they would have to do.
[1:47:26.600 --> 1:47:28.600]  But see, they're conservative so they don't break the law.
[1:47:28.600 --> 1:47:29.600]  The left is doing it.
[1:47:29.600 --> 1:47:30.600]  But they have to now.
[1:47:30.600 --> 1:47:35.600]  They have to now, and their bosses basically approved it because their bosses leak a number of...
[1:47:35.600 --> 1:47:36.600]  That's right.
[1:47:36.600 --> 1:47:38.600]  When they've already set the precedent, you have a responsibility.
[1:47:38.600 --> 1:47:39.600]  I agree.
[1:47:39.600 --> 1:47:40.600]  But the big...
[1:47:40.600 --> 1:47:46.600]  The Trumpet, the clarion that can be blown, the note that can be blown right now, today,
[1:47:46.600 --> 1:47:49.600]  by Trump, face to face with the camera.
[1:47:49.600 --> 1:47:53.600]  He was all Mr. Nice Guy yesterday talking about the baseball shooting.
[1:47:53.600 --> 1:47:59.600]  But he can say, the New York Times drew a map for assassins.
[1:47:59.600 --> 1:48:00.600]  The New York Times...
[1:48:00.600 --> 1:48:02.600]  They gave the target vector.
[1:48:02.600 --> 1:48:07.600]  They gave all the lunatics a map on where to shoot down...
[1:48:07.600 --> 1:48:12.600]  But isn't that the target vector to even show who the target is and where they are?
[1:48:12.600 --> 1:48:14.600]  And their lack of security.
[1:48:14.600 --> 1:48:16.600]  Put them on the defensive.
[1:48:16.600 --> 1:48:18.600]  Don't respond.
[1:48:18.600 --> 1:48:19.600]  Attack.
[1:48:19.600 --> 1:48:21.600]  There is a lot to attack them for.
[1:48:21.600 --> 1:48:23.600]  Sure, you can go out of the way back.
[1:48:23.600 --> 1:48:24.600]  Fast and furious.
[1:48:24.600 --> 1:48:25.600]  Hillary's server.
[1:48:25.600 --> 1:48:26.600]  Yes, we got it.
[1:48:26.600 --> 1:48:29.600]  WikiLeaks, we got it.
[1:48:29.600 --> 1:48:30.600]  That's what I'm saying to the audience.
[1:48:30.600 --> 1:48:31.600]  It's full attack.
[1:48:31.600 --> 1:48:32.600]  And talk about financially.
[1:48:32.600 --> 1:48:33.600]  They're going to hit us.
[1:48:33.600 --> 1:48:34.600]  They're trying to sue us.
[1:48:34.600 --> 1:48:35.600]  They're trying to shut us down.
[1:48:35.600 --> 1:48:37.600]  They got the Islamists after us.
[1:48:37.600 --> 1:48:38.600]  That's their main fifth column.
[1:48:38.600 --> 1:48:42.600]  Folks, when you buy these great products, we need to be flooded with money to let them
[1:48:42.600 --> 1:48:44.600]  know that we're not demoralized.
[1:48:44.600 --> 1:48:45.600]  We're growing.
[1:48:45.600 --> 1:48:47.600]  I want Matt Bracken to do a show.
[1:48:47.600 --> 1:48:49.600]  I'm trying to get all the studios built, everything set up right now.
[1:48:49.600 --> 1:48:51.600]  I want to launch 18 hours a day.
[1:48:51.600 --> 1:48:53.600]  I may just do it even low-tech without the new studio being built.
[1:48:53.600 --> 1:48:56.600]  We've got to launch soon because I know this is the launch time.
[1:48:56.600 --> 1:48:57.600]  Dr. Corsi?
[1:48:57.600 --> 1:48:58.600]  Well, we've got to launch soon.
[1:48:58.600 --> 1:49:00.600]  And that's one of the reasons I'm here.
[1:49:00.600 --> 1:49:06.600]  I really do expand the Washington Bureau to figure out a game plan where we can staff
[1:49:06.600 --> 1:49:08.600]  up and expand.
[1:49:08.600 --> 1:49:11.600]  The prowlers of the presidency are enormous.
[1:49:11.600 --> 1:49:13.600]  They're huge.
[1:49:13.600 --> 1:49:14.600]  And Donald Trump's going to-
[1:49:14.600 --> 1:49:16.600]  And they're calling for civil war.
[1:49:16.600 --> 1:49:19.600]  He has to launch a counteroffensive.
[1:49:19.600 --> 1:49:24.600]  And he's got to clean out the White House of all the Obama-Clinton people.
[1:49:24.600 --> 1:49:25.600]  Fire previous.
[1:49:25.600 --> 1:49:27.600]  I've been saying this now for a month.
[1:49:27.600 --> 1:49:28.600]  Fire previous.
[1:49:28.600 --> 1:49:30.600]  And then fire a bunch more.
[1:49:30.600 --> 1:49:32.600]  You know, he's been right up to the edge doing that three times.
[1:49:32.600 --> 1:49:33.600]  Why hasn't he done it yet?
[1:49:33.600 --> 1:49:36.600]  Because they come in and tell him, oh, this is going to happen if you do this.
[1:49:36.600 --> 1:49:40.600]  This is all the bad things the left is going to say in the New York Times.
[1:49:40.600 --> 1:49:41.600]  They're going to-
[1:49:41.600 --> 1:49:45.600]  They're just discrediting him with the rush obstruction.
[1:49:45.600 --> 1:49:46.600]  They're planning to kill him, like you said.
[1:49:46.600 --> 1:49:47.600]  You're a smart guy.
[1:49:47.600 --> 1:49:48.600]  Precisely.
[1:49:48.600 --> 1:49:50.600]  If your gut tells you they're getting ready to kill him, I'll talk to Matt Bracken about it.
[1:49:50.600 --> 1:49:52.600]  Because it's the same thing that was done to John Kennedy.
[1:49:52.600 --> 1:49:54.600]  It was the same kind of setup.
[1:49:54.600 --> 1:49:56.600]  The deep state wanted to go to war in Vietnam.
[1:49:56.600 --> 1:49:58.600]  They wanted to go to war in Laos, and Kennedy wouldn't do it.
[1:49:58.600 --> 1:50:01.600]  And now they want to teach five-year-olds how to be trainees.
[1:50:01.600 --> 1:50:02.600]  And they were running the-
[1:50:02.600 --> 1:50:07.600]  The CIA's been running the drug trade out of Southeast Asia since before World War II.
[1:50:07.600 --> 1:50:08.600]  They didn't want to end the drug trade.
[1:50:08.600 --> 1:50:09.600]  It was too much money.
[1:50:09.600 --> 1:50:10.600]  That's right.
[1:50:10.600 --> 1:50:12.600]  Matt Bracken, do you agree with Corsi?
[1:50:12.600 --> 1:50:16.600]  They're really trying to precondition the public so they don't panic when Trump gets his head blown off?
[1:50:16.600 --> 1:50:18.600]  Yeah, and just the way that-
[1:50:18.600 --> 1:50:23.600]  It's sort of lost in the shadow of 9-11, but the day of 9-11, or the day before,
[1:50:23.600 --> 1:50:29.600]  the guy named Masoud, I believe, he was called the lion of the Panjir Valley.
[1:50:29.600 --> 1:50:31.600]  He was the patriotic Afghan.
[1:50:31.600 --> 1:50:37.600]  He was killed by a false photojournalist crew with batteries that were explosives.
[1:50:37.600 --> 1:50:41.600]  And so when you see guys with cameras and, you know, big battery packs,
[1:50:41.600 --> 1:50:47.600]  there's no way X-rays are otherwise to know a lithium-ion battery that's the size of decels,
[1:50:47.600 --> 1:50:51.600]  a bag of decels, that they're not full of explosives.
[1:50:51.600 --> 1:50:56.600]  It could even take out Air Force One because they bring these pull reporters through.
[1:50:56.600 --> 1:50:57.600]  And who knows-
[1:50:57.600 --> 1:51:00.600]  That's right. Stay there. Exactly. Left to suicide bombers.
[1:51:00.600 --> 1:51:01.600]  It's on the rise.
[1:51:01.600 --> 1:51:06.600]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you,
[1:51:06.600 --> 1:51:08.600]  but the symptoms are there.
[1:51:08.600 --> 1:51:13.600]  Cross-off energy, blood sugar, spikes, and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat
[1:51:13.600 --> 1:51:16.600]  are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[1:51:16.600 --> 1:51:22.600]  Here, how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[1:51:22.600 --> 1:51:26.600]  My blood pressure has normalized. My diabetes has totally improved.
[1:51:26.600 --> 1:51:30.600]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[1:51:30.600 --> 1:51:33.600]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[1:51:33.600 --> 1:51:38.600]  Everybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative
[1:51:38.600 --> 1:51:41.600]  to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[1:51:58.600 --> 1:52:02.600]  It's been said any society has only three missed meals away from chaos.
[1:52:02.600 --> 1:52:04.600]  Those times may be near.
[1:52:04.600 --> 1:52:09.600]  Think about it. Our country faces multiple terrorist threats and aggressions from Russia and North Korea.
[1:52:09.600 --> 1:52:14.600]  Social unrest and violent marches yet again may lead to looting of stores and city shutdowns.
[1:52:14.600 --> 1:52:20.600]  And our crumbling infrastructure leaves our power grid vulnerable to long-term outages from a single cyber attack.
[1:52:20.600 --> 1:52:27.600]  When the chaos from any one of these threats arises, the government knows it can't provide during a widespread national emergency.
[1:52:27.600 --> 1:52:30.600]  That's why you need your own plan for self-reliance.
[1:52:30.600 --> 1:52:33.600]  That's where my Patriot supply comes in.

[1:53:27.600 --> 1:53:30.600]  It's a no-brainer. A Big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.
[1:53:30.600 --> 1:53:35.600]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA, and other endocrine disruptors,
[1:53:35.600 --> 1:53:38.600]  pesticides, bacteria, viruses, and much more, right?
[1:53:38.600 --> 1:53:40.600]  And does it all at only $0.02 per gallon.
[1:53:40.600 --> 1:53:44.600]  Get the original, most trusted name in gravity water filtration, Big Berkey.

[1:53:53.600 --> 1:53:58.600]  That's 1-877-99-B-E-R-K-E-Y.
[1:54:02.600 --> 1:54:08.600]  So, good ol' Tom Brokaw, the guy that told us about WMDs in Iraq.
[1:54:08.600 --> 1:54:12.600]  The guy that pushed so much to the garbage on us.
[1:54:12.600 --> 1:54:15.600]  He says that I am an unadulterated pure racist.
[1:54:15.600 --> 1:54:19.600]  That's what the $100 word he used means.
[1:54:19.600 --> 1:54:22.600]  And so, here is that clip. I mean, there are just hundreds of these.
[1:54:22.600 --> 1:54:24.600]  It's a full-out assault.
[1:54:24.600 --> 1:54:26.600]  But he tried it on Trump.
[1:54:26.600 --> 1:54:28.600]  Trump's a racist. Trump wants to kill you.
[1:54:28.600 --> 1:54:30.600]  Trump's evil. Trump's a Russian.
[1:54:30.600 --> 1:54:32.600]  Now I'm a racist.
[1:54:32.600 --> 1:54:34.600]  I killed the kids at Newtown.
[1:54:34.600 --> 1:54:36.600]  I mean, basically, they've gotten to that level.
[1:54:36.600 --> 1:54:38.600]  All of it lies. All of it bull.
[1:54:38.600 --> 1:54:42.600]  An unalloyed, I mean, I guess that just means completely confirmed
[1:54:42.600 --> 1:54:45.600]  or over-the-top 100% racist.
[1:54:45.600 --> 1:54:46.600]  Okay, well.
[1:54:46.600 --> 1:54:47.600]  An alloyed is pure.
[1:54:47.600 --> 1:54:48.600]  Yeah, pure.
[1:54:48.600 --> 1:54:52.600]  So, I'm a pure, but they can't show a clip.
[1:54:52.600 --> 1:54:54.600]  I mean, these people are the ultimate fake news.
[1:54:54.600 --> 1:54:56.600]  Tom Brokaw is a joke. Here it is.
[1:54:56.600 --> 1:54:59.600]  The whole game is to, let me play Gotcha.
[1:54:59.600 --> 1:55:02.600]  Let me show you how mean I can be.
[1:55:02.600 --> 1:55:06.600]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones, for example.
[1:55:06.600 --> 1:55:09.600]  But the fact is that he is an unalloyed racist,
[1:55:09.600 --> 1:55:12.600]  a man whose outs are pulling the pin on the grenade every day,
[1:55:12.600 --> 1:55:17.600]  and he has 6 million viewers who are paying attention to him.
[1:55:17.600 --> 1:55:22.600]  And the parents at Newtown are saying they're hearing from his followers all the time.
[1:55:22.600 --> 1:55:26.600]  They buy into what he is saying, which is partly not true.
[1:55:26.600 --> 1:55:31.600]  So at some point, there's got to be a coming together of the political culture.
[1:55:31.600 --> 1:55:33.600]  It's never going to be kumbaya.
[1:55:33.600 --> 1:55:37.600]  We don't expect that because out of that tension can come with things.
[1:55:37.600 --> 1:55:41.600]  But I don't remember in my lifetime, and I'm a pretty good student of history,
[1:55:41.600 --> 1:55:47.600]  when this country was at the slaughter heads with such great consequences
[1:55:47.600 --> 1:55:49.600]  that can result from all of this.
[1:55:49.600 --> 1:55:50.600]  I think our leader is up.
[1:55:50.600 --> 1:55:53.600]  So, I've protested the KKK more than 15 times.
[1:55:53.600 --> 1:55:56.600]  You go to any white supremacist site, they hate me because I want everybody to have freedom
[1:55:56.600 --> 1:55:59.600]  and come together around free market and Christianity.
[1:55:59.600 --> 1:56:01.600]  I don't want to make you be a Christian, but like a Muslim,
[1:56:01.600 --> 1:56:03.600]  but I want you to make you be a Muslim.
[1:56:03.600 --> 1:56:08.600]  I mean, I am hated by the anti-Semites and people
[1:56:08.600 --> 1:56:12.600]  because my ex-wife was part Jewish, so they said they want to kill my kids and all the rest of the stuff
[1:56:12.600 --> 1:56:15.600]  because they're, you know, I guess part Jewish or whatever.
[1:56:15.600 --> 1:56:21.600]  I mean, it's the craziest wack job world to then watch Tom Brokaw say,
[1:56:21.600 --> 1:56:25.600]  I'm the pure racist, hey asshole, excuse me, delay that.
[1:56:25.600 --> 1:56:30.600]  Hey jerk, hey punk, you little skexie.
[1:56:30.600 --> 1:56:34.600]  How about you show the clip of me saying something racist, you jerk.
[1:56:34.600 --> 1:56:37.600]  You know, it isn't fun to get attacked by David Duke and people constantly
[1:56:37.600 --> 1:56:39.600]  and then have people like you on the other side lie about me.
[1:56:39.600 --> 1:56:40.600]  You're scum.
[1:56:40.600 --> 1:56:41.600]  How about that?
[1:56:41.600 --> 1:56:42.600]  How about you're a bastard?
[1:56:42.600 --> 1:56:46.600]  How about you cover up the media for all the pedophilia that goes on in Hollywood?
[1:56:46.600 --> 1:56:47.600]  Tom Brokaw?
[1:56:47.600 --> 1:56:50.600]  I'm sorry, go ahead gentlemen, I don't mean to be ranting, but I mean.
[1:56:50.600 --> 1:56:55.600]  They try to say that Trump was endorsing David Duke.
[1:56:55.600 --> 1:56:59.600]  I mean, any kind of lie, any kind of, see, in the last mine.
[1:56:59.600 --> 1:57:00.600]  That is so desperate.
[1:57:00.600 --> 1:57:02.600]  They've all green-lighted.
[1:57:02.600 --> 1:57:03.600]  Let's be fiction writers.
[1:57:03.600 --> 1:57:04.600]  Let's say, I'm sorry, go ahead.
[1:57:04.600 --> 1:57:09.600]  Well, they've demonized anyone who believes in America, anyone who supports the Constitution.
[1:57:09.600 --> 1:57:10.600]  We're demonized.
[1:57:10.600 --> 1:57:16.600]  And so therefore, on their leftist agenda, which doesn't believe at all in any First
[1:57:16.600 --> 1:57:20.600]  Amendment, Second Amendment, any of the constitutional rights, they want to get rid of it.
[1:57:20.600 --> 1:57:26.600]  They want a revolution that will produce, as Barack Obama said, this fundamental change,
[1:57:26.600 --> 1:57:28.600]  which means socialism, means communism.
[1:57:28.600 --> 1:57:30.600]  That's where they're headed.
[1:57:30.600 --> 1:57:32.600]  And they don't want any opposition.
[1:57:32.600 --> 1:57:35.600]  So you, of course, have to be branded at all their terms.
[1:57:35.600 --> 1:57:36.600]  Look, we're the deplorables.
[1:57:36.600 --> 1:57:37.600]  Hillary said it.
[1:57:37.600 --> 1:57:42.600]  It's just so crazy to see Tom Brokaw, who 20 years ago would show clips first.
[1:57:42.600 --> 1:57:48.600]  He just says, I am a pure racist when everybody can do a search and knows that the black racist
[1:57:48.600 --> 1:57:50.600]  and white racist all hate me because I'm trying to bring this together.
[1:57:50.600 --> 1:57:51.600]  Matt Bracken, we're going to break.
[1:57:51.600 --> 1:57:52.600]  Do five more with us.
[1:57:52.600 --> 1:57:54.600]  But I mean, what do you make of this?
[1:57:54.600 --> 1:57:59.600]  Brokaw is classic because he's a CIA operation mockingbird stooge.
[1:57:59.600 --> 1:58:02.600]  You wind him up and he says WMDs.
[1:58:02.600 --> 1:58:05.600]  So, you know, he's he's got no credibility.
[1:58:05.600 --> 1:58:08.600]  Bringing him out as an elder statesman is like bringing out Dan Rather.
[1:58:08.600 --> 1:58:10.600]  It's just a sign of desperation.
[1:58:10.600 --> 1:58:12.600]  Why do you think they're so desperate?
[1:58:12.600 --> 1:58:15.600]  Because they see that they can lose this whole thing.
[1:58:15.600 --> 1:58:19.600]  They can be they can be wiped out politically speaking.
[1:58:19.600 --> 1:58:23.600]  Don't they get destroying us makes us even stronger.
[1:58:23.600 --> 1:58:27.600]  I mean, I don't want it to happen flesh wise, but spiritually fine.
[1:58:27.600 --> 1:58:29.600]  I mean, let's come back and talk about that.
[1:58:29.600 --> 1:58:30.600]  Because historically, I've studied this.
[1:58:30.600 --> 1:58:31.600]  We'll get Matt Bracken's take on that.
[1:58:31.600 --> 1:58:33.600]  And then, of course, we'll keep riding shotgun with us.
[1:58:33.600 --> 1:58:36.600]  Don't they get that they are losers?
[1:58:36.600 --> 1:58:38.600]  I mean, they are in deep trouble, folks.
[1:58:38.600 --> 1:58:39.600]  We're not just saying that.
[1:58:39.600 --> 1:58:41.600]  I mean, of course, you say they're back in 70 seconds.
[1:58:41.600 --> 1:58:43.600]  We'll get Matt Bracken's final comment.
[1:58:43.600 --> 1:58:45.600]  Enemiesfarmdomestic.com.
[1:58:45.600 --> 1:58:46.600]  We're infowars.com.
[1:58:46.600 --> 1:58:47.600]  We need your support.
[1:58:47.600 --> 1:58:49.600]  We're under enemy attack.
[1:58:49.600 --> 1:58:51.600]  Not a group you develop living defense for us.
[1:58:51.600 --> 1:58:52.600]  It took you over a year to do it.
[1:58:52.600 --> 1:58:53.600]  Why is this so good?
[1:58:53.600 --> 1:58:56.600]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem
[1:58:56.600 --> 1:58:58.600]  that pretty much scares me the most.
[1:58:58.600 --> 1:59:02.600]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food
[1:59:02.600 --> 1:59:04.600]  and water and beverages in my system.
[1:59:04.600 --> 1:59:07.600]  But right now, we're dealing with massive parasites,
[1:59:07.600 --> 1:59:10.600]  which is anything that's harmful to your body
[1:59:10.600 --> 1:59:12.600]  that lives off a host mechanism.
[1:59:12.600 --> 1:59:15.600]  Right now, with all the refugees spreading disease around,
[1:59:15.600 --> 1:59:18.600]  we have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[1:59:18.600 --> 1:59:19.600]  These are all parasites.
[1:59:19.600 --> 1:59:21.600]  Tell us about that all of a sudden.
[1:59:21.600 --> 1:59:22.600]  There's so many things that are in it.
[1:59:22.600 --> 1:59:23.600]  You have the neem in there.
[1:59:23.600 --> 1:59:26.600]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[1:59:26.600 --> 1:59:30.600]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[1:59:30.600 --> 1:59:31.600]  All right.
[1:59:31.600 --> 1:59:32.600]  Well, I'm glad we've got some back in,
[1:59:32.600 --> 1:59:33.600]  because I'm going back on it today.
[1:59:33.600 --> 1:59:34.600]  It just came back in yesterday.
[1:59:34.600 --> 1:59:36.600]  LivingDefense.infowarslife.com.
[1:59:36.600 --> 1:59:37.600]  And folks, you can't lose.
[1:59:37.600 --> 1:59:39.600]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[1:59:39.600 --> 1:59:43.600]  And you support the broadcast, infowarslife.com.
[1:59:43.600 --> 1:59:45.600]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[1:59:45.600 --> 1:59:52.600]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[2:00:15.600 --> 2:00:19.600]  Again, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:00:19.600 --> 2:00:22.600]  What they don't understand is this is America.
[2:00:22.600 --> 2:00:24.600]  Despite all their cultural poisoning,
[2:00:24.600 --> 2:00:26.600]  the spirit is still there and is rising.
[2:00:26.600 --> 2:00:28.600]  I don't just say this, put a good face on it.
[2:00:28.600 --> 2:00:31.600]  I'd say my prognosis and Trump's aren't very good.
[2:00:31.600 --> 2:00:33.600]  But the countries, if people have faith to move forward,
[2:00:33.600 --> 2:00:35.600]  is very good.
[2:00:35.600 --> 2:00:38.600]  And this is an epic moment that they're so afraid of us
[2:00:38.600 --> 2:00:41.600]  and so afraid of Trump and are panicking.
[2:00:41.600 --> 2:00:43.600]  Don't they get, they've been rejected.
[2:00:43.600 --> 2:00:47.600]  They can destroy leaders in the reassurgence of America,
[2:00:47.600 --> 2:00:50.600]  but they cannot destroy the spirit if the people understand that.
[2:00:50.600 --> 2:00:52.600]  Closing comments, Matt Bracken.
[2:00:52.600 --> 2:00:57.600]  Well, it's the most massive gaslighting operation in history.
[2:00:57.600 --> 2:01:01.600]  They did the full-out gaslight to get Hillary elected,
[2:01:01.600 --> 2:01:03.600]  and it wasn't enough.
[2:01:03.600 --> 2:01:06.600]  That's why they're in total panic mode now,
[2:01:06.600 --> 2:01:11.600]  because they're 100% full-throttle gaslight operation,
[2:01:11.600 --> 2:01:13.600]  this media operation.
[2:01:13.600 --> 2:01:17.600]  It didn't snow us, and we're still coming at them.
[2:01:17.600 --> 2:01:20.600]  And that's why they're in panic mode right now.
[2:01:20.600 --> 2:01:21.600]  That's right.
[2:01:21.600 --> 2:01:23.600]  He was just saying during the break what he just said.
[2:01:23.600 --> 2:01:24.600]  We're deconstructing.
[2:01:24.600 --> 2:01:26.600]  We're exposing the compartmentalization.
[2:01:26.600 --> 2:01:27.600]  It's not left or right.
[2:01:27.600 --> 2:01:30.600]  They don't want their own people knowing what's going on.
[2:01:30.600 --> 2:01:33.600]  Our guests, our experts, we have the very blueprint
[2:01:33.600 --> 2:01:35.600]  that only top globalists have,
[2:01:35.600 --> 2:01:37.600]  and that's why they're so upset,
[2:01:37.600 --> 2:01:40.600]  is that Trump's following the new Americana blueprint.
[2:01:40.600 --> 2:01:41.600]  We're aware of it.
[2:01:41.600 --> 2:01:42.600]  We're exposing their blueprint.
[2:01:42.600 --> 2:01:44.600]  That's freaking them out.
[2:01:44.600 --> 2:01:46.600]  It's back to they can't handle the truth,
[2:01:46.600 --> 2:01:48.600]  and the truth is coming out.
[2:01:48.600 --> 2:01:51.600]  They're beginning to understand that day by day,
[2:01:51.600 --> 2:01:52.600]  we're taking their lives.
[2:01:52.600 --> 2:01:56.600]  We've been through eight years of a lying Obama administration.
[2:01:56.600 --> 2:01:58.600]  We have $20 trillion in debt.
[2:01:58.600 --> 2:02:01.600]  We've got the highest amount of tax revenue ever being raised,
[2:02:01.600 --> 2:02:04.600]  and yet we're not able to balance the budget.
[2:02:04.600 --> 2:02:05.600]  We still have a deficit.
[2:02:05.600 --> 2:02:07.600]  We've got to get rid of the GOP elite, too.
[2:02:07.600 --> 2:02:10.600]  Remember, the Trump's enemies are all around him.
[2:02:10.600 --> 2:02:12.600]  It's also the Paul Ryan,
[2:02:12.600 --> 2:02:14.600]  until Trump gets a hold of the RNC money.
[2:02:14.600 --> 2:02:15.600]  A bunch of sycophantic cowards.
[2:02:15.600 --> 2:02:17.600]  I don't want to be a reverent of Trump,
[2:02:17.600 --> 2:02:20.600]  but I mean, think of what he, the courage, what he's done,
[2:02:20.600 --> 2:02:23.600]  what he goes through, the cowards around him.
[2:02:23.600 --> 2:02:26.600]  Matt Bracken, what is it like for you as a veteran, a patriot,
[2:02:26.600 --> 2:02:27.600]  to see somebody like Trump?
[2:02:27.600 --> 2:02:28.600]  I mean, I don't want to be gushing,
[2:02:28.600 --> 2:02:31.600]  but I think we really, we ought to thank God for Donald Trump.
[2:02:31.600 --> 2:02:34.600]  Well, he's very rough around the edges.
[2:02:34.600 --> 2:02:36.600]  Obviously, he's got a lot of flaws,
[2:02:36.600 --> 2:02:38.600]  but I'll tell you what, he's like Atlas,
[2:02:38.600 --> 2:02:42.600]  and he's, who else can go in to drain the swamp,
[2:02:42.600 --> 2:02:47.600]  but a real, you know, ultimate cage fighter?
[2:02:47.600 --> 2:02:51.600]  You know, Mitt Fontleroy III was never going to do anything,
[2:02:51.600 --> 2:02:54.600]  but, you know, go to the cocktail circuit.
[2:02:54.600 --> 2:02:57.600]  That's the Paul Ryan's, the Mitch McConnell's.
[2:02:57.600 --> 2:02:59.600]  Yeah, they just get off on that.
[2:02:59.600 --> 2:03:00.600]  They're in the elite.
[2:03:00.600 --> 2:03:01.600]  Screw everybody.
[2:03:01.600 --> 2:03:02.600]  Trump's different.
[2:03:02.600 --> 2:03:03.600]  Absolutely.
[2:03:03.600 --> 2:03:04.600]  The Lindsey Graham's there.
[2:03:04.600 --> 2:03:08.600]  And they're just as afraid of Trump as the Democrats.
[2:03:08.600 --> 2:03:10.600]  I think, and I totally believe this,
[2:03:10.600 --> 2:03:13.600]  the Republicans want to be the minority party.
[2:03:13.600 --> 2:03:15.600]  It's a lot more comfortable.
[2:03:15.600 --> 2:03:17.600]  You still get to go to the cocktail parties,
[2:03:17.600 --> 2:03:18.600]  but nobody calls you a racist.
[2:03:18.600 --> 2:03:19.600]  Exactly.
[2:03:19.600 --> 2:03:20.600]  They're the opposite of leaders,
[2:03:20.600 --> 2:03:22.600]  and they're scared that Trump isn't afraid to die.
[2:03:22.600 --> 2:03:24.600]  They're scared of the return of men.
[2:03:24.600 --> 2:03:26.600]  Final comment, Matt Bracken.
[2:03:26.600 --> 2:03:29.600]  Yeah, well, I just like to mention my new book,
[2:03:29.600 --> 2:03:32.600]  my new novel, Red Cliffs of Zerhun.
[2:03:32.600 --> 2:03:35.600]  It's about sex slavery, child sex trafficking.
[2:03:35.600 --> 2:03:38.600]  It'll, it's already, I've uploaded it on Kindle,
[2:03:38.600 --> 2:03:41.600]  but I'm going to wait until the print edition is out
[2:03:41.600 --> 2:03:42.600]  in a couple of weeks.
[2:03:42.600 --> 2:03:44.600]  And by the way, that parallels real world,
[2:03:44.600 --> 2:03:46.600]  massive sex trafficking with our little Islamic buddy.
[2:03:46.600 --> 2:03:48.600]  So please come on in the next week to do a full hour
[2:03:48.600 --> 2:03:49.600]  on the book, Matt.
[2:03:49.600 --> 2:03:52.600]  Yeah, and that's why the left is so in line with Islam.
[2:03:52.600 --> 2:03:53.600]  They're both evil.
[2:03:53.600 --> 2:03:55.600]  They both are completely willing to, you know,
[2:03:55.600 --> 2:03:56.600]  traffic children.
[2:03:56.600 --> 2:03:57.600]  It's a religion of pedophiles.
[2:03:57.600 --> 2:03:58.600]  They use sex slavery.
[2:03:58.600 --> 2:04:00.600]  They're allied in that sense.
[2:04:00.600 --> 2:04:02.600]  Don't you think that the congressman was probably targeted
[2:04:02.600 --> 2:04:04.600]  specifically?
[2:04:04.600 --> 2:04:05.600]  I don't know.
[2:04:05.600 --> 2:04:06.600]  He was a second base.
[2:04:06.600 --> 2:04:09.600]  It might have just been one of those lucky things like,
[2:04:09.600 --> 2:04:12.600]  you know, Oswald having a job at the book deposit.
[2:04:12.600 --> 2:04:14.600]  By the way, the word is, his organs got...
[2:04:14.600 --> 2:04:15.600]  The wheels just line up.
[2:04:15.600 --> 2:04:18.600]  We need to pray for the congressman because the word is,
[2:04:18.600 --> 2:04:20.600]  it tore up a bunch of his organs and stuff.
[2:04:20.600 --> 2:04:21.600]  He's a tough guy, but he did it good.
[2:04:21.600 --> 2:04:23.600]  He's fighting for his life right now.
[2:04:23.600 --> 2:04:25.600]  And they're celebrating.
[2:04:25.600 --> 2:04:26.600]  They're celebrating hoping he dies.
[2:04:26.600 --> 2:04:28.600]  I hate these people that live off the backs
[2:04:28.600 --> 2:04:29.600]  of hardworking Americans.
[2:04:29.600 --> 2:04:30.600]  They aren't even ready to fight.
[2:04:30.600 --> 2:04:32.600]  They're trying to start a fight with us.
[2:04:32.600 --> 2:04:34.600]  And they're going to make a hero out of this loser yesterday.
[2:04:34.600 --> 2:04:37.600]  They're going to make him the John Brown of their movement.
[2:04:37.600 --> 2:04:38.600]  Watch what happens.
[2:04:38.600 --> 2:04:40.600]  They're going to call for more of him.
[2:04:40.600 --> 2:04:41.600]  God.
[2:04:41.600 --> 2:04:42.600]  Thanks, man.
[2:04:42.600 --> 2:04:43.600]  Okay.
[2:04:43.600 --> 2:04:45.600]  Dr. Corsi, let's come back with our next guest,
[2:04:45.600 --> 2:04:47.600]  armored dev group, Navy SEAL,
[2:04:47.600 --> 2:04:49.600]  fighting the globalists in the Pedophile Ring.
[2:04:49.600 --> 2:04:59.600]  Let's hear it, Ed.
[2:05:19.600 --> 2:05:21.600]  To seclude members of the Clinton administration,
[2:05:21.600 --> 2:05:23.600]  who may have coordinated with Burger
[2:05:23.600 --> 2:05:25.600]  in the destruction of classified documents.
[2:05:25.600 --> 2:05:28.600]  Burger, Cheryl Mills and now disgraced Loretta Lynch
[2:05:28.600 --> 2:05:30.600]  all worked together at the law firm
[2:05:30.600 --> 2:05:32.600]  that handled Clinton's tax returns.
[2:05:32.600 --> 2:05:34.600]  No wonder why Lynch didn't want Clinton's emails
[2:05:34.600 --> 2:05:36.600]  to be investigated or prosecuted.
[2:05:36.600 --> 2:05:37.600]  You throw that in with the fact
[2:05:37.600 --> 2:05:39.600]  Comey admitted he's the leaker
[2:05:39.600 --> 2:05:42.600]  and, well, we have a new investigation to focus on, don't we?
[2:05:42.600 --> 2:05:44.600]  No, we don't because the Trump administration
[2:05:44.600 --> 2:05:47.600]  is busy trying to make America great again.
[2:05:47.600 --> 2:05:49.600]  But perhaps someday a real investigation
[2:05:49.600 --> 2:05:52.600]  into real collusion will make it to Capitol Hill
[2:05:52.600 --> 2:05:54.600]  and Lynch and Clinton will have their days
[2:05:54.600 --> 2:05:56.600]  to testify under oath.
[2:05:56.600 --> 2:06:18.600]  We've taken thousands of years of research
[2:06:18.600 --> 2:06:28.600]  and research into the future of the American people.
[2:06:28.600 --> 2:06:31.600]  We believe we've come as close to perfection
[2:06:31.600 --> 2:06:34.600]  when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[2:06:34.600 --> 2:06:36.600]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family
[2:06:36.600 --> 2:06:39.600]  and you owe it to the future of this country in the world
[2:06:39.600 --> 2:06:41.600]  that patriots stay as healthy and as clean
[2:06:41.600 --> 2:06:43.600]  and as focused as you can be
[2:06:43.600 --> 2:06:46.600]  because we need you, the remnant of America,
[2:06:46.600 --> 2:06:48.600]  to reignite those brush fires to the next level
[2:06:48.600 --> 2:06:50.600]  and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[2:06:50.600 --> 2:06:52.600]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together,
[2:06:52.600 --> 2:06:54.600]  we're changing the world.
[2:06:54.600 --> 2:06:55.600]  Now it's time to change our bodies
[2:06:55.600 --> 2:07:17.600]  with ZShieldM4sLife.com.
[2:07:26.600 --> 2:07:27.600]  It is an answer to prayer
[2:07:27.600 --> 2:07:29.600]  and because we're cutting out the middleman,
[2:07:29.600 --> 2:07:30.600]  20% off retail,

[2:07:31.600 --> 2:07:33.600]  an additional 25% off.
[2:07:33.600 --> 2:07:34.600]  It's all there.
[2:07:34.600 --> 2:07:35.600]  The body wash,
[2:07:35.600 --> 2:07:36.600]  the shampoo,
[2:07:36.600 --> 2:07:37.600]  the deodorant,
[2:07:37.600 --> 2:07:38.600]  the mouthwash,
[2:07:38.600 --> 2:07:40.600]  all of it is truly game-changing.
[2:07:40.600 --> 2:07:41.600]  It is the exact same product,
[2:07:41.600 --> 2:07:43.600]  just the name is different,
[2:07:43.600 --> 2:07:44.600]  EmRick's Essentials
[2:07:44.600 --> 2:07:46.600]  and it's on average 20% off
[2:07:46.600 --> 2:07:48.600]  what it would be in stores,
[2:07:48.600 --> 2:07:50.600]  buying it directly from infowarstore.com.

[2:07:56.600 --> 2:07:58.600]  of EmRick's Essentials.

[2:08:04.600 --> 2:08:06.600]  It's Alex Jones
[2:08:06.600 --> 2:08:07.600]  coming to you live
[2:08:07.600 --> 2:08:10.600]  from the front lines of the info war.
[2:08:10.600 --> 2:08:13.600]  All right, he's the host of Discovery Channel,
[2:08:13.600 --> 2:08:15.600]  History Channel shows.
[2:08:15.600 --> 2:08:17.600]  He, of course, is a famous Navy SEAL.
[2:08:17.600 --> 2:08:18.600]  Can't get into all the different groups
[2:08:18.600 --> 2:08:20.600]  he was involved in or in.
[2:08:20.600 --> 2:08:22.600]  We just had another great Navy SEAL
[2:08:22.600 --> 2:08:23.600]  Patriot on Matt Bracken.
[2:08:23.600 --> 2:08:24.600]  Craig Sawyer is on with us right now
[2:08:24.600 --> 2:08:26.600]  on tacticalinsider.com.
[2:08:26.600 --> 2:08:27.600]  He's a former Marine,
[2:08:27.600 --> 2:08:29.600]  former Navy SEAL sniper combat structure.
[2:08:29.600 --> 2:08:30.600]  He's a great fighter.
[2:08:30.600 --> 2:08:31.600]  He's a great fighter.
[2:08:31.600 --> 2:08:32.600]  He's a great fighter.
[2:08:32.600 --> 2:08:33.600]  He's a great fighter.
[2:08:33.600 --> 2:08:34.600]  He's a great fighter.
[2:08:34.600 --> 2:08:35.600]  He's a great fighter.
[2:08:35.600 --> 2:08:36.600]  He's a great fighter.
[2:08:36.600 --> 2:08:37.600]  He's a great fighter.
[2:08:37.600 --> 2:08:38.600]  He's a great fighter.
[2:08:38.600 --> 2:08:40.600]  He's a former Navy SEAL sniper combat structure.
[2:08:40.600 --> 2:08:42.600]  Sawyer is the owner of Tactical Insider,
[2:08:42.600 --> 2:08:43.600]  which brings technical advice
[2:08:43.600 --> 2:08:45.600]  and weapons and combat to Hollywood and films.
[2:08:45.600 --> 2:08:47.600]  He began his career in the U.S. Marine Corps
[2:08:47.600 --> 2:08:48.600]  and switched to the U.S. Navy
[2:08:48.600 --> 2:08:50.600]  to pursue his career in special operations.
[2:08:50.600 --> 2:08:51.600]  Sawyer has run specialized teams,
[2:08:51.600 --> 2:08:53.600]  provides security to politicians, dignitaries,
[2:08:53.600 --> 2:08:54.600]  and goes on from there.
[2:08:54.600 --> 2:08:56.600]  Tactical Insider has contributed to
[2:08:56.600 --> 2:08:58.600]  CBS, Fox, U-Namen.
[2:08:58.600 --> 2:08:59.600]  I'm not going to go over it all.
[2:08:59.600 --> 2:09:01.600]  He's been a host of Top Shot,
[2:09:01.600 --> 2:09:03.600]  five seasons on the History Channel.
[2:09:03.600 --> 2:09:04.600]  I'm not going to go over it all.
[2:09:04.600 --> 2:09:06.600]  But what he's really doing is getting blocked,
[2:09:06.600 --> 2:09:09.600]  trying to produce TV shows about the pedophile rings.
[2:09:09.600 --> 2:09:12.600]  He's got amazing sources nationally, internationally.
[2:09:12.600 --> 2:09:14.600]  I, not made out of money,
[2:09:14.600 --> 2:09:16.600]  but I've given $100,000 to the effort
[2:09:16.600 --> 2:09:19.600]  because they've been trying to censor him and block him.
[2:09:19.600 --> 2:09:22.600]  This pedophile thing is what they're most scared of.
[2:09:22.600 --> 2:09:24.600]  And the congressman that's fighting for his life,
[2:09:24.600 --> 2:09:27.600]  Steve Scalise, I know from my sources,
[2:09:27.600 --> 2:09:29.600]  I don't want to get into things that's classified.
[2:09:29.600 --> 2:09:32.600]  Behind the scenes was spearheading a lot of this.
[2:09:32.600 --> 2:09:34.600]  He got it obviously shot yesterday
[2:09:34.600 --> 2:09:36.600]  and it's fighting for his life.
[2:09:36.600 --> 2:09:38.600]  So this is what they're scared of.
[2:09:38.600 --> 2:09:41.600]  This is what they're really, really scared of right now.
[2:09:41.600 --> 2:09:44.600]  Dr. Corsi's riding shotgun with us for at least 30 minutes.
[2:09:44.600 --> 2:09:46.600]  We'll open the phones up in about 30 minutes
[2:09:46.600 --> 2:09:49.600]  when Corsi leaves us and we're just taking calls
[2:09:49.600 --> 2:09:51.600]  with Craig Sawyer or the Sawman.
[2:09:51.600 --> 2:09:53.600]  But we got Tom Brokaw saying,
[2:09:53.600 --> 2:09:55.600]  I am a complete racist.
[2:09:55.600 --> 2:09:57.600]  That's a quote.
[2:09:57.600 --> 2:09:59.600]  He used this fancy term,
[2:09:59.600 --> 2:10:02.600]  unalloyed, which means in the dictionary,
[2:10:02.600 --> 2:10:04.600]  total or complete.
[2:10:04.600 --> 2:10:06.600]  Pure.
[2:10:06.600 --> 2:10:08.600]  And then, thank you Mr. Webster.
[2:10:08.600 --> 2:10:10.600]  He's right. I said pure.
[2:10:10.600 --> 2:10:13.600]  And I mean, it's like, where's the clip of me being racist?
[2:10:13.600 --> 2:10:15.600]  I'm like unifying people.
[2:10:15.600 --> 2:10:17.600]  They are such scum.
[2:10:17.600 --> 2:10:19.600]  Then they say that I'm glad kids died
[2:10:19.600 --> 2:10:21.600]  or kids didn't die at Newtown.
[2:10:21.600 --> 2:10:22.600]  Never said that.
[2:10:22.600 --> 2:10:24.600]  The public didn't buy it because they were using blue screens
[2:10:24.600 --> 2:10:25.600]  and stuff.
[2:10:25.600 --> 2:10:27.600]  I said, were they doing fake locations?
[2:10:27.600 --> 2:10:29.600]  Did they fake kill kids, really kill kids?
[2:10:29.600 --> 2:10:30.600]  You never know.
[2:10:30.600 --> 2:10:32.600]  What's happening?
[2:10:32.600 --> 2:10:34.600]  They are misrepresenting.
[2:10:34.600 --> 2:10:36.600]  They're in total panic mode.
[2:10:36.600 --> 2:10:38.600]  I don't want to make the show about me.
[2:10:38.600 --> 2:10:40.600]  We've got huge hack attacks trying to take down the websites right now.
[2:10:40.600 --> 2:10:43.600]  I mean, I've seen pre-war propaganda
[2:10:43.600 --> 2:10:45.600]  that wasn't this heavy against myself,
[2:10:45.600 --> 2:10:47.600]  Trump and others.
[2:10:47.600 --> 2:10:49.600]  But let me tell you, it's surreal
[2:10:49.600 --> 2:10:51.600]  to have them, you know,
[2:10:51.600 --> 2:10:53.600]  this whole Megan Kelly thing, by the way,
[2:10:53.600 --> 2:10:55.600]  I'm going to put behind the scenes stuff out
[2:10:55.600 --> 2:10:57.600]  to prove she's a liar later.
[2:10:57.600 --> 2:10:59.600]  In fact, let's queue that up in a moment.
[2:10:59.600 --> 2:11:00.600]  This isn't a hit piece.
[2:11:00.600 --> 2:11:01.600]  Oh, this isn't about Peter Gate.
[2:11:01.600 --> 2:11:03.600]  Oh, this isn't about Newtown.
[2:11:03.600 --> 2:11:04.600]  And of course, the whole thing is,
[2:11:04.600 --> 2:11:06.600]  she's the keynote speaker there and all the rest of it.
[2:11:06.600 --> 2:11:08.600]  They are on a desperate offensive.
[2:11:08.600 --> 2:11:11.600]  Craig Sawyer, what on earth do you think is really going on?
[2:11:11.600 --> 2:11:13.600]  Again, I don't want to make it about me,
[2:11:13.600 --> 2:11:15.600]  but I think in what they're targeting,
[2:11:15.600 --> 2:11:17.600]  we learn what they're afraid of.
[2:11:17.600 --> 2:11:20.600]  What is going on in your view?
[2:11:20.600 --> 2:11:22.600]  Well, look at their desperation, Alex.
[2:11:22.600 --> 2:11:26.600]  I think that's really the answer is they are in a corner.
[2:11:26.600 --> 2:11:30.600]  Trump is not on board with the deep state subversion
[2:11:30.600 --> 2:11:32.600]  of the United States, of the people.
[2:11:32.600 --> 2:11:34.600]  And he's not on board with tearing down
[2:11:34.600 --> 2:11:36.600]  our protective constitution.
[2:11:36.600 --> 2:11:39.600]  And he's a threat to those that want power.
[2:11:39.600 --> 2:11:42.600]  They've been slowly gaining power
[2:11:42.600 --> 2:11:44.600]  through brown stoning operations
[2:11:44.600 --> 2:11:48.600]  and other methods of undermining the American people.
[2:11:48.600 --> 2:11:51.600]  And Trump is, President Trump is on board
[2:11:51.600 --> 2:11:54.600]  with the United States, with American people
[2:11:54.600 --> 2:11:56.600]  being empowered.
[2:11:56.600 --> 2:12:00.600]  They're scared of a real American being back.
[2:12:00.600 --> 2:12:02.600]  I mean, they're scared America's back.
[2:12:02.600 --> 2:12:06.600]  So break down your latest information.
[2:12:06.600 --> 2:12:09.600]  Yeah, they're going out on a limb
[2:12:09.600 --> 2:12:12.600]  in desperation to try to make something stick.
[2:12:12.600 --> 2:12:15.600]  So it's almost like they're swirling the drain,
[2:12:15.600 --> 2:12:18.600]  grasping for anything and throwing mud in all directions
[2:12:18.600 --> 2:12:20.600]  to see what they can cause to stick.
[2:12:20.600 --> 2:12:22.600]  And a lot of it's pathetic to watch,
[2:12:22.600 --> 2:12:25.600]  and none of it stands up to any sort of scrutiny.
[2:12:25.600 --> 2:12:28.600]  So I encourage people just turn off the volume
[2:12:28.600 --> 2:12:30.600]  and watch what happens.
[2:12:30.600 --> 2:12:35.600]  And if you notice, the only violent that's condemned
[2:12:35.600 --> 2:12:38.600]  is the violence against the ruling elite.
[2:12:38.600 --> 2:12:41.600]  You know, they're okay pumping out all this rhetoric
[2:12:41.600 --> 2:12:43.600]  and go, you know, burn the White House
[2:12:43.600 --> 2:12:46.600]  and I'm envisioning this against the president
[2:12:46.600 --> 2:12:48.600]  and all the violence, boom, boom, boom.
[2:12:48.600 --> 2:12:53.600]  They're bombing our populace with hate speech
[2:12:53.600 --> 2:12:56.600]  and encouragement to be violent.
[2:12:56.600 --> 2:12:58.600]  They won't condone it unless it's against one,
[2:12:58.600 --> 2:13:00.600]  so they're one of their own.
[2:13:00.600 --> 2:13:02.600]  So it's a double standard.
[2:13:02.600 --> 2:13:07.600]  People need to kind of tune out the radical,
[2:13:07.600 --> 2:13:09.600]  the cooler heads.
[2:13:09.600 --> 2:13:12.600]  The whole objective here with all this craziness
[2:13:12.600 --> 2:13:15.600]  is it's a power struggle over the United States.
[2:13:15.600 --> 2:13:19.600]  So the people need to realize that the objective
[2:13:19.600 --> 2:13:22.600]  is to get us to vote away the rest of our rights,
[2:13:22.600 --> 2:13:25.600]  our freedoms and liberties, and we must not do that.
[2:13:25.600 --> 2:13:26.600]  You know, there's the...
[2:13:26.600 --> 2:13:30.600]  That's right, America is coming back from the grave yet again.
[2:13:30.600 --> 2:13:31.600]  They're panicking, they're scared,
[2:13:31.600 --> 2:13:33.600]  so they're throwing the kitchen sink at it.
[2:13:33.600 --> 2:13:36.600]  And I agree with Corsi and with you, Craig.
[2:13:36.600 --> 2:13:37.600]  This is desperation.
[2:13:37.600 --> 2:13:40.600]  So watching them try to kill all these congressmen,
[2:13:40.600 --> 2:13:42.600]  watching Huffington Post and others sing too bad,
[2:13:42.600 --> 2:13:44.600]  you know, it wasn't more people.
[2:13:44.600 --> 2:13:46.600]  They organized war.
[2:13:46.600 --> 2:13:48.600]  What do you make as a veteran,
[2:13:48.600 --> 2:13:52.600]  a combat guy, a baddest of the bad, but a good guy?
[2:13:52.600 --> 2:13:55.600]  What do you make of all these wimps
[2:13:55.600 --> 2:13:57.600]  who are playing at war and envisioning
[2:13:57.600 --> 2:14:00.600]  how they're going to kill us and calling for me to die
[2:14:00.600 --> 2:14:03.600]  and calling for us all to be killed and running their mouths?
[2:14:03.600 --> 2:14:05.600]  I mean, this is bizarre behavior.
[2:14:05.600 --> 2:14:08.600]  Well, it's hostile and they're getting their marching orders
[2:14:08.600 --> 2:14:10.600]  from the same place they're getting their funding.
[2:14:10.600 --> 2:14:13.600]  And that's why they're all in the same sheet of music.
[2:14:13.600 --> 2:14:18.600]  Yeah, Soros and those that are like-minded, you know?
[2:14:18.600 --> 2:14:21.600]  Soros is a big figure as far as we're concerned,
[2:14:21.600 --> 2:14:23.600]  but he's a small figure in relation to the rest
[2:14:23.600 --> 2:14:27.600]  of the global elite who are kind of wise enough
[2:14:27.600 --> 2:14:28.600]  to hang back and run for it.
[2:14:28.600 --> 2:14:29.600]  Exactly, he's the archetype.
[2:14:29.600 --> 2:14:31.600]  He's the guy that's willing to be out front.
[2:14:31.600 --> 2:14:34.600]  Yeah, it's an easy name to throw on, you know,
[2:14:34.600 --> 2:14:35.600]  a face to throw on the...
[2:14:35.600 --> 2:14:37.600]  So we've got a global crime syndicate,
[2:14:37.600 --> 2:14:39.600]  the traffic's children, it's backing radical Islam,
[2:14:39.600 --> 2:14:41.600]  it hates Christianity,
[2:14:41.600 --> 2:14:44.600]  it's basically like a satanic chaos or specter.
[2:14:44.600 --> 2:14:46.600]  What do we do to counter them?
[2:14:46.600 --> 2:14:48.600]  I mean, clearly they're hyping up murder and death,
[2:14:48.600 --> 2:14:50.600]  kill us, kill us, kill us.
[2:14:50.600 --> 2:14:51.600]  What do we do?
[2:14:51.600 --> 2:14:53.600]  Well, look, in the military,
[2:14:53.600 --> 2:14:59.600]  we realize that the fire superiority is an absolute must
[2:14:59.600 --> 2:15:01.600]  to win any conflict.
[2:15:01.600 --> 2:15:06.600]  And what it is, is if you are able to have a greater volume
[2:15:06.600 --> 2:15:10.600]  of fire against your enemy and a more effective volume of fire,
[2:15:10.600 --> 2:15:15.600]  it allows it to be even easier for you as the fight progresses.
[2:15:15.600 --> 2:15:16.600]  And what's gone on right now,
[2:15:16.600 --> 2:15:19.600]  we've got the dynamic to where the deep state subversives
[2:15:19.600 --> 2:15:24.600]  and the anti-American radicals have been allowed
[2:15:24.600 --> 2:15:28.600]  to attack our constitution and our president at will
[2:15:28.600 --> 2:15:31.600]  with seemingly no return fire upon them.
[2:15:31.600 --> 2:15:36.600]  So they're able to have a greater effect than they would
[2:15:36.600 --> 2:15:38.600]  if we were to start prosecuting them.
[2:15:38.600 --> 2:15:42.600]  They need to be investigated and perp-walked unmasked
[2:15:42.600 --> 2:15:43.600]  because right now...
[2:15:43.600 --> 2:15:44.600]  I mean, totally.
[2:15:44.600 --> 2:15:46.600]  You're also a federal officer as well.
[2:15:46.600 --> 2:15:48.600]  But here's the problem, Craig Sawyer.
[2:15:48.600 --> 2:15:50.600]  We don't even have that time now.
[2:15:50.600 --> 2:15:52.600]  They're clearly getting ready for a physical civil war,
[2:15:52.600 --> 2:15:55.600]  an attempted chaos, an attempted overthrow.
[2:15:55.600 --> 2:15:59.600]  So as we enter this paradigm, what does the president do?
[2:15:59.600 --> 2:16:01.600]  I mean, when people are openly saying all over the news,
[2:16:01.600 --> 2:16:03.600]  kill the president, overthrow the government,
[2:16:03.600 --> 2:16:05.600]  kill everybody we don't agree with,
[2:16:05.600 --> 2:16:07.600]  I'm not calling for a military move,
[2:16:07.600 --> 2:16:10.600]  but it almost seems like all the president can do
[2:16:10.600 --> 2:16:12.600]  is now know the military's behind him,
[2:16:12.600 --> 2:16:14.600]  get a bunch of state governors behind him
[2:16:14.600 --> 2:16:15.600]  and move against these people.
[2:16:15.600 --> 2:16:17.600]  I mean, I think we need military action.
[2:16:17.600 --> 2:16:20.600]  Well, I want to comment on one thing to the Democrats,
[2:16:20.600 --> 2:16:23.600]  especially through the Obama years,
[2:16:23.600 --> 2:16:26.600]  have taken control of all the agencies.
[2:16:26.600 --> 2:16:27.600]  They're in charge.
[2:16:27.600 --> 2:16:28.600]  And it's an outside power.
[2:16:28.600 --> 2:16:30.600]  We need military operations.
[2:16:30.600 --> 2:16:33.600]  Trump has got to clean out the Department of Justice,
[2:16:33.600 --> 2:16:38.600]  the IRS, the White House, Fire Prevus, get these under control.
[2:16:38.600 --> 2:16:39.600]  They're never going to let him get there.
[2:16:39.600 --> 2:16:41.600]  What I'm telling you is they're clearly getting ready
[2:16:41.600 --> 2:16:42.600]  to launch their offensive.
[2:16:42.600 --> 2:16:43.600]  I can tell you.
[2:16:43.600 --> 2:16:44.600]  So what do you disagree?
[2:16:44.600 --> 2:16:45.600]  No, I don't disagree.
[2:16:45.600 --> 2:16:47.600]  But he needs to do this now.
[2:16:47.600 --> 2:16:48.600]  He needs to do it right now.
[2:16:48.600 --> 2:16:51.600]  We need the Ray Cohn to come out of Trump
[2:16:51.600 --> 2:16:55.600]  when he realizes that his top aides, Michael Cohn,
[2:16:55.600 --> 2:16:58.600]  his lawyer is going to be under investigation.
[2:16:58.600 --> 2:17:00.600]  Roger Stone's under investigation.
[2:17:00.600 --> 2:17:02.600]  They intend to take down all the people around him
[2:17:02.600 --> 2:17:03.600]  just like...
[2:17:03.600 --> 2:17:05.600]  They've said, I'm commanding the Russians.
[2:17:05.600 --> 2:17:07.600]  You didn't see that clip?
[2:17:07.600 --> 2:17:09.600]  Hillary now says, I command the Russians.
[2:17:09.600 --> 2:17:10.600]  Right.
[2:17:10.600 --> 2:17:12.600]  Well, Hillary always was in the back pocket of the Russians
[2:17:12.600 --> 2:17:13.600]  just as Podesta was.
[2:17:13.600 --> 2:17:15.600]  I report on that extensively.
[2:17:15.600 --> 2:17:17.600]  They are the ones who are getting money from the Russians.
[2:17:17.600 --> 2:17:20.600]  And what they're blaming, the Democrats are blaming
[2:17:20.600 --> 2:17:22.600]  the Republicans for what the Democrats...
[2:17:22.600 --> 2:17:23.600]  Exactly.
[2:17:23.600 --> 2:17:24.600]  Let me ask Craig Sawyer this and then you.
[2:17:24.600 --> 2:17:25.600]  Right.
[2:17:25.600 --> 2:17:26.600]  What do we do?
[2:17:26.600 --> 2:17:28.600]  Because everybody knows I've been on there 22 years.
[2:17:28.600 --> 2:17:29.600]  I don't get this alarmist.
[2:17:29.600 --> 2:17:32.600]  They're all over the news saying, kill everybody,
[2:17:32.600 --> 2:17:33.600]  kill the president.
[2:17:33.600 --> 2:17:34.600]  The New York Times is like,
[2:17:34.600 --> 2:17:36.600]  here's where they play baseball if you want to kill them.
[2:17:36.600 --> 2:17:38.600]  I mean, it's like...
[2:17:38.600 --> 2:17:40.600]  I don't want an offensive war.
[2:17:40.600 --> 2:17:41.600]  We're already under attack.
[2:17:41.600 --> 2:17:43.600]  Craig Sawyer, what do we do?
[2:17:43.600 --> 2:17:46.600]  I'm with you, Alex, in being upset
[2:17:46.600 --> 2:17:49.600]  at the call for violence and destruction
[2:17:49.600 --> 2:17:56.600]  and the lack of prosecutions in response.
[2:17:56.600 --> 2:18:00.600]  However, we still have to play a long-term game here.
[2:18:00.600 --> 2:18:04.600]  As you know, I've been pounding all of my contacts
[2:18:04.600 --> 2:18:07.600]  that have the president's ear to please urge him
[2:18:07.600 --> 2:18:12.600]  to replace any and all directors of each of our agencies
[2:18:12.600 --> 2:18:14.600]  that he does not have 100% faith in
[2:18:14.600 --> 2:18:16.600]  and to grab each one of them
[2:18:16.600 --> 2:18:19.600]  and personally charge them with his commander's intent
[2:18:19.600 --> 2:18:21.600]  to clean their agencies of all subversives.
[2:18:21.600 --> 2:18:23.600]  And if they do that,
[2:18:23.600 --> 2:18:26.600]  they could free up the log jams and have these agencies
[2:18:26.600 --> 2:18:29.600]  working on our behalf instead of against us.
[2:18:29.600 --> 2:18:31.600]  Right now, so many people are reporting crimes
[2:18:31.600 --> 2:18:33.600]  and it's not only...
[2:18:33.600 --> 2:18:35.600]  Well, let me stop you there and we'll come back and get to it.
[2:18:35.600 --> 2:18:37.600]  Craig Sawyer, you talk about commander's intent.
[2:18:37.600 --> 2:18:39.600]  They're calling him talking to people
[2:18:39.600 --> 2:18:42.600]  about loyalty to America obstruction.
[2:18:42.600 --> 2:18:44.600]  That's how they've got him trying to paralyze him.
[2:18:44.600 --> 2:18:45.600]  It's normal.
[2:18:45.600 --> 2:18:49.600]  The president has the executive power
[2:18:49.600 --> 2:18:51.600]  to command the executive.
[2:18:51.600 --> 2:18:54.600]  They're trying to usurp that right now.
[2:18:54.600 --> 2:18:56.600]  Yeah, well, it's not loyalty to him.
[2:18:56.600 --> 2:18:58.600]  It's loyalty to the Constitution.
[2:18:58.600 --> 2:19:00.600]  I think he needs to be careful to make that clear
[2:19:00.600 --> 2:19:02.600]  just so that they can't take semantics
[2:19:02.600 --> 2:19:04.600]  and use that as leverage again.
[2:19:04.600 --> 2:19:05.600]  No, I agree, but I was interrupting you.
[2:19:05.600 --> 2:19:06.600]  We're going to break in a minute.
[2:19:06.600 --> 2:19:07.600]  I mean, he needs to...
[2:19:07.600 --> 2:19:09.600]  Look, I'm not somebody that wants...
[2:19:09.600 --> 2:19:11.600]  I want stability. Everybody knows that.
[2:19:11.600 --> 2:19:12.600]  They're all over the news saying,
[2:19:12.600 --> 2:19:14.600]  kill the president, kill everybody.
[2:19:14.600 --> 2:19:16.600]  They've got communists marching around awesome
[2:19:16.600 --> 2:19:18.600]  with loaded guns with their fingers on the trigger.
[2:19:18.600 --> 2:19:20.600]  The police just sit there
[2:19:20.600 --> 2:19:22.600]  while they're menacing everybody.
[2:19:22.600 --> 2:19:25.600]  I'm not going to be intimidated by a bunch of communists.
[2:19:25.600 --> 2:19:28.600]  Well, I mean, again, I think it's a matter of
[2:19:28.600 --> 2:19:31.600]  Trump now going on the offensive
[2:19:31.600 --> 2:19:33.600]  and going on the offensive by taking control
[2:19:33.600 --> 2:19:35.600]  of the White House and taking control of the agencies.
[2:19:35.600 --> 2:19:38.600]  Then let's define that with Greg Sawyer, Jerome Corsi,
[2:19:38.600 --> 2:19:40.600]  on the other side of this break.
[2:19:40.600 --> 2:19:42.600]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen,
[2:19:42.600 --> 2:19:45.600]  these people are frothing criminals.
[2:19:45.600 --> 2:19:47.600]  They have a bloodlust for us,
[2:19:47.600 --> 2:19:49.600]  and they've got all these weirdo wimps
[2:19:49.600 --> 2:19:51.600]  that we've been in a fist fight
[2:19:51.600 --> 2:19:53.600]  that want to have this coming of age
[2:19:53.600 --> 2:19:55.600]  to kill a bunch of veterans and cops and people.
[2:19:55.600 --> 2:20:24.600]  I just can't believe anybody's putting up with this.
[2:20:25.600 --> 2:20:27.600]  FullyCookedBacon.com.
[2:20:55.600 --> 2:20:57.600]  We've taken thousands of years of known research
[2:20:57.600 --> 2:20:59.600]  and put it together with our own four years
[2:20:59.600 --> 2:21:02.600]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems
[2:21:02.600 --> 2:21:04.600]  that God gave us through Mother Nature
[2:21:04.600 --> 2:21:06.600]  to detoxify the body.
[2:21:06.600 --> 2:21:08.600]  That's why I'm introducing Z Shield,
[2:21:08.600 --> 2:21:10.600]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[2:21:10.600 --> 2:21:12.600]  It's made in the USA.
[2:21:12.600 --> 2:21:14.600]  It's filled with known compounds from nature
[2:21:14.600 --> 2:21:17.600]  that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body
[2:21:17.600 --> 2:21:19.600]  and it supports the infomer.
[2:21:19.600 --> 2:21:21.600]  It is a classical 360-win.
[2:21:21.600 --> 2:21:23.600]  This is the first time
[2:21:23.600 --> 2:21:25.600]  that I personally have been taking for over a year,
[2:21:25.600 --> 2:21:28.600]  and now we believe we have come as close to perfection
[2:21:28.600 --> 2:21:31.600]  when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[2:21:31.600 --> 2:21:33.600]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family,
[2:21:33.600 --> 2:21:36.600]  and you owe it to the future of this country and the world
[2:21:36.600 --> 2:21:39.600]  that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused
[2:21:39.600 --> 2:21:41.600]  as you can be because we need you,
[2:21:41.600 --> 2:21:43.600]  the remnant of America,
[2:21:43.600 --> 2:21:45.600]  to reignite those brush fires to the next level
[2:21:45.600 --> 2:21:47.600]  and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[2:21:47.600 --> 2:21:49.600]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together,
[2:21:49.600 --> 2:21:51.600]  we're truly grateful for your support
[2:21:51.600 --> 2:21:53.600]  and your prayers together.
[2:21:53.600 --> 2:21:54.600]  We're changing the world.
[2:21:54.600 --> 2:21:56.600]  Now it's time to change our bodies
[2:21:56.600 --> 2:22:25.600]  and our lives.
[2:22:27.600 --> 2:22:30.600]  Any time, any place, any way,
[2:22:30.600 --> 2:22:33.600]  radio remains the most intimate of all forms of media
[2:22:33.600 --> 2:22:36.600]  at home, at work, in the car, on smartphones.
[2:22:36.600 --> 2:22:39.600]  Over 90% of consumers still listen to radio every week.
[2:22:39.600 --> 2:22:41.600]  That makes choosing radio
[2:22:41.600 --> 2:22:43.600]  is a place to advertise your business.
[2:22:43.600 --> 2:22:45.600]  One of the best decisions you can make.

[2:23:54.600 --> 2:23:56.600]  Shelter when you need it most.
[2:24:24.600 --> 2:24:28.600]  It's really how I feel,
[2:24:28.600 --> 2:24:30.600]  but I'm letting the dog off the leash
[2:24:30.600 --> 2:24:32.600]  because I don't want a civil war to start.
[2:24:32.600 --> 2:24:34.600]  They're trying to start one.
[2:24:34.600 --> 2:24:36.600]  Greg Sawyer is riding the shotgun on this the rest of the hour
[2:24:36.600 --> 2:24:39.600]  and we're going to open the phones up in the next segments.
[2:24:39.600 --> 2:24:41.600]  We'll get into his pedophile investigations
[2:24:41.600 --> 2:24:43.600]  and more that are going on.
[2:24:43.600 --> 2:24:45.600]  Of course, he's going to finish up right here.
[2:24:45.600 --> 2:24:48.600]  He'll be back on the mountain news tonight, 7 o'clock central.
[2:24:48.600 --> 2:24:50.600]  But when you study history
[2:24:50.600 --> 2:24:52.600]  and you see where this country is
[2:24:52.600 --> 2:24:55.600]  and you see the elite doubling down to control everybody.
[2:24:55.600 --> 2:24:57.600]  Greg, it really concerns me
[2:24:57.600 --> 2:25:01.600]  and I just hope that somehow
[2:25:01.600 --> 2:25:04.600]  cooler heads prevail where all this is going
[2:25:04.600 --> 2:25:06.600]  because all we're trying to do is cut taxes
[2:25:06.600 --> 2:25:08.600]  and get some of the factory jobs back
[2:25:08.600 --> 2:25:11.600]  and not let them sexualize children in school, Greg.
[2:25:11.600 --> 2:25:14.600]  Yep, yep, it's steady as she goes
[2:25:14.600 --> 2:25:16.600]  is what the doctor ordered on this, Alex.
[2:25:16.600 --> 2:25:19.600]  Yes, it's upsetting. Yes, it's destructive.
[2:25:19.600 --> 2:25:22.600]  It needs to play long-term ball.
[2:25:22.600 --> 2:25:24.600]  Like I said, he needs to get a hold of the directors
[2:25:24.600 --> 2:25:26.600]  of these top agencies
[2:25:26.600 --> 2:25:28.600]  and make sure that they're cleaning house.
[2:25:28.600 --> 2:25:30.600]  That needs to be done en masse.
[2:25:30.600 --> 2:25:32.600]  Yeah, why can't Trump do that?
[2:25:32.600 --> 2:25:34.600]  It's a project going on.
[2:25:34.600 --> 2:25:36.600]  I don't know that he's not doing that.
[2:25:36.600 --> 2:25:38.600]  I mean, look at Comey.
[2:25:38.600 --> 2:25:40.600]  Some of these things take time
[2:25:40.600 --> 2:25:43.600]  and I'm sure he's kind of swamped.
[2:25:43.600 --> 2:25:46.600]  He's surrounded by opposition on all sides
[2:25:46.600 --> 2:25:48.600]  even though they're supposed to cover his back
[2:25:48.600 --> 2:25:50.600]  and don't have his back.
[2:25:50.600 --> 2:25:52.600]  So I imagine I don't want to be too critical of him
[2:25:52.600 --> 2:25:54.600]  because I know he's in hostile...
[2:25:54.600 --> 2:25:56.600]  No, I agree. It's a college of cowards.
[2:25:56.600 --> 2:25:58.600]  Of course, he's about to leave, so let me have him finish.
[2:25:58.600 --> 2:26:01.600]  What does he do when he's just surrounded by yes men and trash?
[2:26:01.600 --> 2:26:03.600]  Well, he's surrounded by worse than that.
[2:26:03.600 --> 2:26:07.600]  Trump is surrounded by previous and others who have their agenda
[2:26:07.600 --> 2:26:11.600]  is really the agenda of the elite GOP establishment,
[2:26:11.600 --> 2:26:14.600]  which is to keep in the money trough
[2:26:14.600 --> 2:26:16.600]  and they don't want to cut off.
[2:26:16.600 --> 2:26:18.600]  They don't want to lose their power.
[2:26:18.600 --> 2:26:20.600]  So this is a, right now,
[2:26:20.600 --> 2:26:23.600]  Trump during the campaign reached a point
[2:26:23.600 --> 2:26:27.600]  where Lewandowski could not get the delegates counted for him.
[2:26:27.600 --> 2:26:29.600]  So he changed horses.
[2:26:29.600 --> 2:26:31.600]  He brought in someone who could count delegates.
[2:26:31.600 --> 2:26:34.600]  Now, the team of Trump has got advising him
[2:26:34.600 --> 2:26:40.600]  can't counter this democratic deep state propaganda techniques.
[2:26:40.600 --> 2:26:42.600]  He needs to bring in an A team
[2:26:42.600 --> 2:26:45.600]  that can counter the propaganda techniques
[2:26:45.600 --> 2:26:48.600]  and turn this around just like he did during the campaign.
[2:26:48.600 --> 2:26:50.600]  And even the one in Telegraph says that.
[2:26:50.600 --> 2:26:53.600]  Yeah, and he's got to do it starting at the top in the White House
[2:26:53.600 --> 2:26:56.600]  because he's got people in the White House who are disloyal to him
[2:26:56.600 --> 2:26:59.600]  who are leaking, subverting, and giving him bad advice.
[2:26:59.600 --> 2:27:01.600]  I mean, this whole idea, you know, I said,
[2:27:01.600 --> 2:27:03.600]  first thing you do is you change the subject.
[2:27:03.600 --> 2:27:05.600]  Well, now, previous's idea is you take a trip to Wisconsin
[2:27:05.600 --> 2:27:07.600]  and talk about jobs.
[2:27:07.600 --> 2:27:09.600]  Mainstream media is going to laugh that off.
[2:27:09.600 --> 2:27:11.600]  They don't have to cover that. They didn't.
[2:27:11.600 --> 2:27:13.600]  It doesn't change the subject.
[2:27:13.600 --> 2:27:16.600]  They're going to shed at least twice a week going right at them.
[2:27:16.600 --> 2:27:18.600]  I'll tell you what changes the subject.
[2:27:18.600 --> 2:27:20.600]  Fire, previous and Fire Mueller.
[2:27:20.600 --> 2:27:22.600]  The subject will change right away.
[2:27:22.600 --> 2:27:24.600]  And the press will go berserk and Trump should sit there
[2:27:24.600 --> 2:27:26.600]  and say impeach me.
[2:27:26.600 --> 2:27:27.600]  You don't like this, impeach me.
[2:27:27.600 --> 2:27:28.600]  And they won't have the votes.
[2:27:28.600 --> 2:27:29.600]  Screw them.
[2:27:29.600 --> 2:27:31.600]  Right. They won't be able to do it.
[2:27:31.600 --> 2:27:33.600]  Instead, they're waiting to undermine him until they have an election.
[2:27:33.600 --> 2:27:35.600]  And then they admit, the Democrats admit,
[2:27:35.600 --> 2:27:37.600]  they want COG, overthrow Trump.
[2:27:37.600 --> 2:27:39.600]  And then remove all the Republicans that got elected
[2:27:39.600 --> 2:27:41.600]  saying they're Russian agents.
[2:27:41.600 --> 2:27:43.600]  It's nothing to be accomplished by the Trump administration.
[2:27:43.600 --> 2:27:45.600]  They want to block every legislative effort.
[2:27:45.600 --> 2:27:48.600]  And what Trump's got to do is he's got to get an A team of people around him
[2:27:48.600 --> 2:27:50.600]  who understand how you fight.
[2:27:50.600 --> 2:27:52.600]  Yeah, why do you think the Deputy Attorney General came out and said,
[2:27:52.600 --> 2:27:54.600]  oh, he can't fire Mueller? That's a load of manure.
[2:27:54.600 --> 2:27:56.600]  It's nonsense. He can fire anybody he wants.
[2:27:56.600 --> 2:27:58.600]  So does that show that guy's either compromised, scared or not?
[2:27:58.600 --> 2:28:01.600]  Trying to convince Trump to go down the path
[2:28:01.600 --> 2:28:04.600]  in which the end result is he commits suicide.
[2:28:04.600 --> 2:28:07.600]  And that's not the path we want Trump to go on.
[2:28:07.600 --> 2:28:09.600]  We want him to save the administration.
[2:28:09.600 --> 2:28:11.600]  And to do it, he's got to get better advisers.
[2:28:11.600 --> 2:28:14.600]  No, I agree. But you say you're seeing all the telltale signs of them
[2:28:14.600 --> 2:28:16.600]  preconditioning, getting folks ready for an assassin.
[2:28:16.600 --> 2:28:21.600]  Yes, because see, the point is, if they lose by not able to impeach,
[2:28:21.600 --> 2:28:23.600]  if they can't get Trump out of office through those methods,
[2:28:23.600 --> 2:28:26.600]  the next plan is assassination.
[2:28:26.600 --> 2:28:28.600]  Same thing that happened to Jack Kennedy.
[2:28:28.600 --> 2:28:31.600]  And I want to start running some shows which demonstrate exactly how this works.
[2:28:31.600 --> 2:28:33.600]  How this works. All right.
[2:28:33.600 --> 2:28:35.600]  Dr. Jerome Kurs, you'll be back on the news tonight.
[2:28:35.600 --> 2:28:37.600]  Infowars, Washington bureau chief, thank you so much. Stay there.
[2:28:37.600 --> 2:28:39.600]  We're about to go to break. Craig, I'm going to give you the floor for like 10 minutes
[2:28:39.600 --> 2:28:41.600]  when we come back and then take calls.
[2:28:41.600 --> 2:28:42.600]  All right.
[2:28:42.600 --> 2:28:46.600]  800-25-99231, 800-25-99231.
[2:28:46.600 --> 2:28:47.600]  We're using the GCN number today.
[2:28:47.600 --> 2:28:50.600]  800-25-99231.
[2:28:50.600 --> 2:28:54.600]  Your questions to veteran Navy SEAL TV host, expert marksman, patriot,
[2:28:54.600 --> 2:28:58.600]  and a guy running a undercover production operation with news
[2:28:58.600 --> 2:29:01.600]  to expose the pedophile rings and all the busk
[2:29:01.600 --> 2:29:02.600]  happening around the country.
[2:29:02.600 --> 2:29:03.600]  We'll talk to him after the break.
[2:29:03.600 --> 2:29:07.600]  What some of the points you want to get to, Craig Sawyer?
[2:29:07.600 --> 2:29:11.600]  Well, one of the points, it's a two-point answer to your previous question.
[2:29:11.600 --> 2:29:14.600]  One is Trump needs to fire people.
[2:29:14.600 --> 2:29:16.600]  That's what he's good at in business.
[2:29:16.600 --> 2:29:18.600]  And I think that's what needs to happen.
[2:29:18.600 --> 2:29:22.600]  And the other is while playing a long-term intelligent ball,
[2:29:22.600 --> 2:29:26.600]  if there is an extremist threat, he can pull in the National Guard
[2:29:26.600 --> 2:29:31.600]  and even contract companies of veterans that'll cover his sick where needed.
[2:29:31.600 --> 2:29:33.600]  Well, let's talk about that.
[2:29:33.600 --> 2:29:34.600]  You're done giving your points.
[2:29:34.600 --> 2:29:36.600]  I want to ask you, what happens if this goes south?
[2:29:36.600 --> 2:29:40.600]  I mean, what are the bad scenarios with a nation full of great people
[2:29:40.600 --> 2:30:05.600]  but also a bunch of spoiled rotten commies and scum that want to ride a passage war?
[2:30:10.600 --> 2:30:13.600]  But while this parading around of your child dressing in drag
[2:30:13.600 --> 2:30:16.600]  for your own personal benefit should be considered child abuse,
[2:30:16.600 --> 2:30:17.600]  in fact, it's quite the opposite.
[2:30:17.600 --> 2:30:21.600]  In Ontario, Canada, Bill 89, the Youth and Family Services Act,
[2:30:21.600 --> 2:30:24.600]  now includes language for the proper treatment of children
[2:30:24.600 --> 2:30:27.600]  in regards to their gender identity and expression.
[2:30:27.600 --> 2:30:31.600]  So if your boy wants to be a girl and you tell your boy that's not natural
[2:30:31.600 --> 2:30:33.600]  or not in my home, then the government can take your kid.
[2:30:33.600 --> 2:30:37.600]  And with Bill Nye in the left trying to convince everyone in gender fluidity,
[2:30:37.600 --> 2:30:40.600]  this could become a major concern for some households.
[2:30:40.600 --> 2:30:42.600]  Perhaps this is why here in the United States,
[2:30:42.600 --> 2:30:46.600]  we now have at least 20 transsexuals who will be running for office
[2:30:46.600 --> 2:30:47.600]  in the next round of elections.
[2:30:47.600 --> 2:30:49.600]  But governments are getting ahead of this trend,
[2:30:49.600 --> 2:30:52.600]  making sure if you feel this is an unnatural thing,
[2:30:52.600 --> 2:30:55.600]  you don't speak up because the government might take your kids.
[2:30:55.600 --> 2:31:18.600]  For infowars.com, this is Owen Schreuer.
[2:31:25.600 --> 2:31:27.600]  To the best job you can to purify your air.
[2:31:27.600 --> 2:31:30.600]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment,
[2:31:30.600 --> 2:31:33.600]  while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid
[2:31:33.600 --> 2:31:35.600]  most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[2:31:35.600 --> 2:31:37.600]  The general public doesn't.
[2:31:37.600 --> 2:31:41.600]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[2:31:41.600 --> 2:31:45.600]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[2:31:45.600 --> 2:31:48.600]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house,
[2:31:48.600 --> 2:31:52.600]  replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[2:31:52.600 --> 2:31:55.600]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today
[2:31:55.600 --> 2:31:57.600]  at infowars.com.
[2:32:01.600 --> 2:32:03.600]  Let's go to Devin and Florida.
[2:32:03.600 --> 2:32:05.600]  Devin and Florida, you're on the air.
[2:32:05.600 --> 2:32:07.600]  Great. Hey, thank you so much.
[2:32:07.600 --> 2:32:09.600]  Listen, I have bought your product,
[2:32:09.600 --> 2:32:11.600]  and I gotta say they're amazing.
[2:32:11.600 --> 2:32:13.600]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it,
[2:32:13.600 --> 2:32:16.600]  because I've got caveman, superman vitality,
[2:32:16.600 --> 2:32:19.600]  secret swell, vitamin, inner fusion.
[2:32:19.600 --> 2:32:21.600]  I've got the body armor.
[2:32:21.600 --> 2:32:23.600]  You're the type of listener that makes it all possible.
[2:32:23.600 --> 2:32:25.600]  Which nutraceutical does you like best?
[2:32:25.600 --> 2:32:27.600]  I really like the vitamin,
[2:32:27.600 --> 2:32:29.600]  mineral fusion, to be honest.
[2:32:29.600 --> 2:32:30.600]  That's amazing. That's really incredible.
[2:32:30.600 --> 2:32:32.600]  I drank it in the morning, and I swear to you,
[2:32:32.600 --> 2:32:34.600]  I felt incredible.
[2:32:34.600 --> 2:32:36.600]  My morning was fantastic,
[2:32:36.600 --> 2:32:39.600]  and I love you guys, I love the info wars through,
[2:32:39.600 --> 2:32:41.600]  and I just want to, yeah,
[2:32:41.600 --> 2:32:44.600]  I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there
[2:32:44.600 --> 2:32:46.600]  who's on the fence, just buy it,
[2:32:46.600 --> 2:32:48.600]  you will love it. I'm telling you,
[2:32:48.600 --> 2:32:50.600]  I've never bought a bad product.
[2:32:50.600 --> 2:32:52.600]  In our news, it's the same thing you find
[2:32:52.600 --> 2:32:54.600]  in our products at infowarslife.com.
[2:32:54.600 --> 2:33:22.600]  It's a win-win, infowarslife.com.
[2:33:24.600 --> 2:33:26.600]  If you're watching on television,
[2:33:26.600 --> 2:33:28.600]  you see a black screen,
[2:33:28.600 --> 2:33:30.600]  our computer just crashed,
[2:33:30.600 --> 2:33:32.600]  one of the computers that feeds the screen.
[2:33:32.600 --> 2:33:34.600]  That's what'll happen if the hack attack's happening
[2:33:34.600 --> 2:33:36.600]  against infowars.com,
[2:33:36.600 --> 2:33:38.600]  and our whole operation right now are successful.
[2:33:38.600 --> 2:33:40.600]  But this is a war.
[2:33:40.600 --> 2:33:42.600]  I'm not some social justice warrior
[2:33:42.600 --> 2:33:44.600]  that gets upset, you know,
[2:33:44.600 --> 2:33:46.600]  when five guys try to kill me in a parking lot,
[2:33:46.600 --> 2:33:48.600]  or the IRS comes after me,
[2:33:48.600 --> 2:33:50.600]  or the IRS comes after me,
[2:33:50.600 --> 2:33:52.600]  or the IRS comes after me,
[2:33:52.600 --> 2:33:54.600]  or the media says that I'm, you know,
[2:33:54.600 --> 2:33:56.600]  worse than Charlie Manson.
[2:33:56.600 --> 2:33:58.600]  Because I'm fighting
[2:33:58.600 --> 2:34:00.600]  a corrupt media that works
[2:34:00.600 --> 2:34:02.600]  for the most nasty elites on Earth
[2:34:02.600 --> 2:34:04.600]  that are devil worshipers, pedophiles.
[2:34:04.600 --> 2:34:06.600]  Look at the Clintons, look at Jerry Epstein,
[2:34:06.600 --> 2:34:08.600]  look how we broke
[2:34:08.600 --> 2:34:10.600]  from the NYPD when the FBI wouldn't do anything.
[2:34:10.600 --> 2:34:12.600]  We broke.
[2:34:12.600 --> 2:34:14.600]  We broke the day before Breitbart,
[2:34:14.600 --> 2:34:16.600]  the day before Eric Prince,
[2:34:16.600 --> 2:34:18.600]  his credit, broke
[2:34:18.600 --> 2:34:20.600]  that they were, you know,
[2:34:20.600 --> 2:34:22.600]  that Wiener was trying to procure young girls online,
[2:34:22.600 --> 2:34:24.600]  and sexting them.
[2:34:24.600 --> 2:34:26.600]  I mean, I had guest on and stuff
[2:34:26.600 --> 2:34:28.600]  that, like, had the photos before it was in the news,
[2:34:28.600 --> 2:34:30.600]  from NYPD and the New Jersey
[2:34:30.600 --> 2:34:32.600]  to state police. You think these
[2:34:32.600 --> 2:34:34.600]  pedo rings that'll grab kids out of a backyard
[2:34:34.600 --> 2:34:36.600]  aren't going to fight back?
[2:34:36.600 --> 2:34:38.600]  I expect anything to happen.
[2:34:38.600 --> 2:34:40.600]  And so, it's not like I'm Mr. Tough Guy,
[2:34:40.600 --> 2:34:42.600]  in fact, I'm going to tell you something.
[2:34:42.600 --> 2:34:44.600]  You have fight and flight.
[2:34:44.600 --> 2:34:46.600]  And I guess you can hide, too,
[2:34:46.600 --> 2:34:48.600]  that's a form of flight.
[2:34:48.600 --> 2:34:50.600]  In my life, that's my fight is my flight.
[2:34:50.600 --> 2:34:52.600]  Like, I'm upset by this.
[2:34:52.600 --> 2:34:54.600]  I fight it.
[2:34:54.600 --> 2:34:56.600]  It's not because I have courage. It's like, how the hell
[2:34:56.600 --> 2:34:58.600]  could you not fight a group of people
[2:34:58.600 --> 2:35:00.600]  that do the most of this
[2:35:00.600 --> 2:35:02.600]  despic, raping babies, you name it?
[2:35:02.600 --> 2:35:04.600]  I mean, Craig Sawyer's got all his sources. He can tell you about it.
[2:35:04.600 --> 2:35:06.600]  We're going to get to him here in just a moment.
[2:35:06.600 --> 2:35:08.600]  But take Tom Brokaw.
[2:35:08.600 --> 2:35:10.600]  I don't make fun of my elders.
[2:35:10.600 --> 2:35:12.600]  I love old folks. But to see him all
[2:35:12.600 --> 2:35:14.600]  doddering and looking like
[2:35:14.600 --> 2:35:16.600]  a shriveled cryptkeeper
[2:35:16.600 --> 2:35:18.600]  up there saying that I'm a pure racist,
[2:35:18.600 --> 2:35:20.600]  unalloyed,
[2:35:20.600 --> 2:35:22.600]  using a fancy term,
[2:35:22.600 --> 2:35:24.600]  what? I mean, no one
[2:35:24.600 --> 2:35:26.600]  even ever claimed that till I supported
[2:35:26.600 --> 2:35:28.600]  Trump. It's just made up. It's like saying,
[2:35:28.600 --> 2:35:30.600]  he's a Kibler elf.
[2:35:30.600 --> 2:35:32.600]  But it doesn't hurt me. He thinks he like
[2:35:32.600 --> 2:35:34.600]  uses that as a power term.
[2:35:34.600 --> 2:35:36.600]  He's the fake news. Bottom line.
[2:35:36.600 --> 2:35:38.600]  We need your financial support.
[2:35:38.600 --> 2:35:40.600]  We have amazing products that have changed
[2:35:40.600 --> 2:35:42.600]  my life and changed so many other people's lives.
[2:35:42.600 --> 2:35:44.600]  The good halogen iodine, nobody else out
[2:35:44.600 --> 2:35:46.600]  there's got the pure deep earth crystal
[2:35:46.600 --> 2:35:48.600]  source. It's all from seaweed. We have it
[2:35:48.600 --> 2:35:50.600]  next to that's back in stock.
[2:35:50.600 --> 2:35:52.600]  4.9 stars.
[2:35:52.600 --> 2:35:54.600]  That is our highest rated product.
[2:35:54.600 --> 2:35:56.600]  It's our second best seller.
[2:35:56.600 --> 2:35:58.600]  It's actually Brainforce is the number
[2:35:58.600 --> 2:36:00.600]  one seller. Amazing. Just top
[2:36:00.600 --> 2:36:02.600]  Neutropic at a lower price. We just
[2:36:02.600 --> 2:36:04.600]  followed all the other top brands do
[2:36:04.600 --> 2:36:06.600]  both a stronger dose at a lower price. Now
[2:36:06.600 --> 2:36:08.600]  20% more each bottle.
[2:36:08.600 --> 2:36:10.600]  We have a bottom defense.
[2:36:10.600 --> 2:36:12.600]  Great high quality probiotic that we keep
[2:36:12.600 --> 2:36:14.600]  refrigerated and send to you refrigerated.
[2:36:14.600 --> 2:36:16.600]  But it also keeps non-refrigerators
[2:36:16.600 --> 2:36:18.600]  stronger if you don't. That's back
[2:36:18.600 --> 2:36:20.600]  we got 25 billion and 50
[2:36:20.600 --> 2:36:22.600]  billion. We've discontinued the half
[2:36:22.600 --> 2:36:24.600]  strength. People like the full strength one.
[2:36:24.600 --> 2:36:26.600]  50 billion bottom defense.

[2:36:36.600 --> 2:36:38.600]  and infowarsstore.com. And I want to come to
[2:36:38.600 --> 2:36:40.600]  tomorrow and show folks that we've had record
[2:36:40.600 --> 2:36:42.600]  sales in the face of them trying to shut down
[2:36:42.600 --> 2:36:44.600]  and denial of service
[2:36:44.600 --> 2:36:46.600]  our sites. Because
[2:36:46.600 --> 2:36:48.600]  I'm just trying to fund the revolution against the global
[2:36:48.600 --> 2:36:50.600]  as peacefully. I have 2700
[2:36:50.600 --> 2:36:52.600]  yesterday
[2:36:52.600 --> 2:36:54.600]  to a great American running for congress
[2:36:54.600 --> 2:36:56.600]  against the Democrats.
[2:36:58.600 --> 2:37:00.600]  I'm not bragging. I just gave $100,000
[2:37:00.600 --> 2:37:02.600]  to the film production that nobody else will fund.
[2:37:02.600 --> 2:37:04.600]  The Craig Sawyer who's got all these big top
[2:37:04.600 --> 2:37:06.600]  TV shows and all these big names.
[2:37:06.600 --> 2:37:08.600]  But it came to exposing pedophiles and stuff
[2:37:08.600 --> 2:37:10.600]  happening. They killed it. So I'm not up here
[2:37:10.600 --> 2:37:12.600]  as a goody two shoe. How could I
[2:37:12.600 --> 2:37:14.600]  not when I first gave 10 grand
[2:37:14.600 --> 2:37:16.600]  and watched them try to ban his PayPal
[2:37:16.600 --> 2:37:18.600]  and his Facebook and say he's fake news
[2:37:18.600 --> 2:37:20.600]  when he's got three or four TV shows
[2:37:20.600 --> 2:37:22.600]  and is well known forever and then I want to talk
[2:37:22.600 --> 2:37:24.600]  about it was in dev group. All that.
[2:37:24.600 --> 2:37:26.600]  It just shows what he's gone through. I've gone
[2:37:26.600 --> 2:37:28.600]  through even on a bigger scale. So I do
[2:37:28.600 --> 2:37:30.600]  that. So when you support us, you know
[2:37:30.600 --> 2:37:32.600]  I'm committed wherever my heart leads
[2:37:32.600 --> 2:37:34.600]  me to fund it. But you are who
[2:37:34.600 --> 2:37:36.600]  empowers us. So it's a serious act
[2:37:36.600 --> 2:37:38.600]  of resistance. It's a
[2:37:38.600 --> 2:37:40.600]  major
[2:37:40.600 --> 2:37:42.600]  kick or a major
[2:37:42.600 --> 2:37:44.600]  punch
[2:37:44.600 --> 2:37:46.600]  at the heart of the globalist

[2:37:58.600 --> 2:38:00.600]  I'm a soldier in an information war
[2:38:00.600 --> 2:38:02.600]  and it's becoming physical and it's
[2:38:02.600 --> 2:38:04.600]  psychological and I tell the truth they lie.
[2:38:04.600 --> 2:38:06.600]  It's clear.
[2:38:06.600 --> 2:38:08.600]  But you know I have to get to the point now
[2:38:08.600 --> 2:38:10.600]  talking to my children, not just my wife
[2:38:10.600 --> 2:38:12.600]  about where this is going. But I've got to
[2:38:12.600 --> 2:38:14.600]  do it as a man because there's
[2:38:14.600 --> 2:38:16.600]  no future if I don't. So Craig Sawyer
[2:38:16.600 --> 2:38:18.600]  author, researcher
[2:38:18.600 --> 2:38:20.600]  for folks that just tuned in, they can
[2:38:20.600 --> 2:38:22.600]  go to one of your great websites
[2:38:22.600 --> 2:38:24.600]  tacticalinsider.com or vets
[2:38:24.600 --> 2:38:26.600]  for childrescue.org
[2:38:26.600 --> 2:38:28.600]  Let's get into what's currently happening.
[2:38:28.600 --> 2:38:30.600]  You're all these big pedophile bust
[2:38:30.600 --> 2:38:32.600]  everywhere getting almost no attention
[2:38:32.600 --> 2:38:34.600]  representative Steve
[2:38:34.600 --> 2:38:36.600]  Scalia, Scalise that was shot.
[2:38:36.600 --> 2:38:38.600]  Just kind of spearheading that. What can you tell us
[2:38:38.600 --> 2:38:40.600]  about ongoing things that are happening
[2:38:40.600 --> 2:38:42.600]  in the nature of the war against these
[2:38:42.600 --> 2:38:44.600]  vampires?
[2:38:44.600 --> 2:38:46.600]  Well, one of the things that speaking of
[2:38:46.600 --> 2:38:48.600]  representative Steve Scalise
[2:38:48.600 --> 2:38:50.600]  he was gunned down and
[2:38:50.600 --> 2:38:52.600]  by whom? You know, we don't
[2:38:52.600 --> 2:38:54.600]  have a gun problem in this country. We've got
[2:38:54.600 --> 2:38:56.600]  a culture problem. A part of our
[2:38:56.600 --> 2:38:58.600]  culture which is a loving mother
[2:38:58.600 --> 2:39:00.600]  and father and family unit
[2:39:00.600 --> 2:39:02.600]  is under attack and look what all these
[2:39:02.600 --> 2:39:04.600]  crazed
[2:39:04.600 --> 2:39:06.600]  mass murderers come from. They don't come
[2:39:06.600 --> 2:39:08.600]  from
[2:39:08.600 --> 2:39:10.600]  stable Christian families
[2:39:10.600 --> 2:39:12.600]  that have strong moral
[2:39:12.600 --> 2:39:14.600]  values and teach their kids
[2:39:14.600 --> 2:39:16.600]  right from wrong. They come from
[2:39:16.600 --> 2:39:18.600]  broken, lost
[2:39:18.600 --> 2:39:20.600]  families where there is no moral code.
[2:39:20.600 --> 2:39:22.600]  The media won't talk
[2:39:22.600 --> 2:39:24.600]  about that. They want to put it on an object
[2:39:24.600 --> 2:39:26.600]  when they're using trucks and bombs
[2:39:26.600 --> 2:39:28.600]  and knives and machetes
[2:39:28.600 --> 2:39:30.600]  and guns and everything else. They want to blame it
[2:39:30.600 --> 2:39:32.600]  only on the gun because
[2:39:32.600 --> 2:39:34.600]  the one tool that the American
[2:39:34.600 --> 2:39:36.600]  can defend themselves
[2:39:36.600 --> 2:39:38.600]  from against oppressors.
[2:39:38.600 --> 2:39:40.600]  So that's the only thing that
[2:39:40.600 --> 2:39:42.600]  they're out there. So we got to realize
[2:39:42.600 --> 2:39:44.600]  what the false narrative
[2:39:44.600 --> 2:39:46.600]  is. But I think
[2:39:46.600 --> 2:39:48.600]  looking at
[2:39:48.600 --> 2:39:50.600]  representative Scalise and
[2:39:50.600 --> 2:39:52.600]  him being gunned down. Well, we've even got
[2:39:52.600 --> 2:39:54.600]  Democrats now too, congressman
[2:39:54.600 --> 2:39:56.600]  saying Trump's parsley to blame for the
[2:39:56.600 --> 2:39:58.600]  shooting. I mean, we've got Wolf Blitzer
[2:39:58.600 --> 2:40:00.600]  having guessed on saying the guy wasn't evil that did
[2:40:00.600 --> 2:40:02.600]  it. These people are really asking
[2:40:02.600 --> 2:40:04.600]  for it. I mean, where's the line in the sand?
[2:40:04.600 --> 2:40:06.600]  I get info war wise. We can
[2:40:06.600 --> 2:40:08.600]  probably still win. But what do we do
[2:40:08.600 --> 2:40:10.600]  if they just start killing people everywhere?
[2:40:10.600 --> 2:40:12.600]  Well, it's
[2:40:12.600 --> 2:40:14.600]  projection. They project what they
[2:40:14.600 --> 2:40:16.600]  actually are on to
[2:40:16.600 --> 2:40:18.600]  others and it's gotten to where it's laughable
[2:40:18.600 --> 2:40:20.600]  now for people that aren't heavily
[2:40:20.600 --> 2:40:22.600]  medicated
[2:40:22.600 --> 2:40:24.600]  and don't have any form of communication.
[2:40:24.600 --> 2:40:26.600]  It's laughable. So the good
[2:40:26.600 --> 2:40:28.600]  news is people are turning out tuning out
[2:40:28.600 --> 2:40:30.600]  the mainstream media more
[2:40:30.600 --> 2:40:32.600]  and more and going through alternative sources
[2:40:32.600 --> 2:40:34.600]  of getting straight to the facts.
[2:40:34.600 --> 2:40:36.600]  It's a sad
[2:40:36.600 --> 2:40:38.600]  it's a sad day to
[2:40:38.600 --> 2:40:40.600]  see the mass deception and deceit
[2:40:40.600 --> 2:40:42.600]  going on against the we the people.
[2:40:42.600 --> 2:40:44.600]  But we've got to realize
[2:40:44.600 --> 2:40:46.600]  who it is that owns all of our
[2:40:46.600 --> 2:40:48.600]  our mainstream news outlets.
[2:40:48.600 --> 2:40:50.600]  So quote unquote news.
[2:40:50.600 --> 2:40:52.600]  So we've got to take it with
[2:40:52.600 --> 2:40:54.600]  a grain of salt and watch the actions
[2:40:54.600 --> 2:40:56.600]  where I agree. Craig, I'm going to go back to you
[2:40:56.600 --> 2:40:58.600]  in a minute and get into your pedophile investigation.
[2:40:58.600 --> 2:41:00.600]  But first, here is this
[2:41:00.600 --> 2:41:02.600]  senator. Here's this congressman
[2:41:02.600 --> 2:41:04.600]  who's a Republican. It's also Democrats
[2:41:04.600 --> 2:41:06.600]  saying it will put the article on screen. I can
[2:41:06.600 --> 2:41:08.600]  read it to folks if the crew will do that place
[2:41:08.600 --> 2:41:10.600]  and a GOP rep
[2:41:10.600 --> 2:41:12.600]  or representative Trump
[2:41:12.600 --> 2:41:14.600]  partially to blame for hostility
[2:41:14.600 --> 2:41:16.600]  that led to lawmakers shooting.
[2:41:16.600 --> 2:41:18.600]  I mean, a lot of Republicans
[2:41:18.600 --> 2:41:20.600]  are running up the white flag. This
[2:41:20.600 --> 2:41:22.600]  guy is a shameful
[2:41:22.600 --> 2:41:24.600]  creature when he's just trying to cut
[2:41:24.600 --> 2:41:26.600]  our taxes and repeal Obamacare.
[2:41:26.600 --> 2:41:28.600]  They're the ones lying and putting on all the
[2:41:28.600 --> 2:41:30.600]  rhetoric. Trump has been incredibly
[2:41:30.600 --> 2:41:32.600]  nice compared to them. This is
[2:41:32.600 --> 2:41:34.600]  sickening to watch these people
[2:41:34.600 --> 2:41:36.600]  literally kissing the butt of MSNBC.
[2:41:36.600 --> 2:41:38.600]  Let's play that clip.
[2:41:38.600 --> 2:41:40.600]  I would argue that the president has
[2:41:40.600 --> 2:41:42.600]  unleashed is partially again, not in any way
[2:41:42.600 --> 2:41:44.600]  totally, but partially to blame
[2:41:44.600 --> 2:41:46.600]  for demons that have been unleashed,
[2:41:46.600 --> 2:41:48.600]  whether it's what I saw at
[2:41:48.600 --> 2:41:50.600]  a senior center back home
[2:41:50.600 --> 2:41:52.600]  and people saying FU and FU and FU
[2:41:52.600 --> 2:41:54.600]  to each other at a senior center
[2:41:54.600 --> 2:41:56.600]  or retirement center where they're going to see each other
[2:41:56.600 --> 2:41:58.600]  playing croquet the next day
[2:41:58.600 --> 2:42:00.600]  or with what happened, again,
[2:42:00.600 --> 2:42:02.600]  not with what happened yesterday,
[2:42:02.600 --> 2:42:04.600]  but the fact
[2:42:04.600 --> 2:42:06.600]  that you've got the top guy saying
[2:42:06.600 --> 2:42:08.600]  well, I wish I could hit you in the face
[2:42:08.600 --> 2:42:10.600]  and it's not why don't you and I'll pay your legal fees,
[2:42:10.600 --> 2:42:12.600]  that's bizarre.
[2:42:12.600 --> 2:42:14.600]  And that was a year and a half ago after attack
[2:42:14.600 --> 2:42:16.600]  after attack after attack.
[2:42:16.600 --> 2:42:18.600]  So you've got the Republican establishment rolling over
[2:42:18.600 --> 2:42:20.600]  to this.
[2:42:20.600 --> 2:42:22.600]  You've got them absolutely groveling.
[2:42:22.600 --> 2:42:24.600]  I mean, it's the media
[2:42:24.600 --> 2:42:26.600]  that's creating this saying kill Trump.
[2:42:26.600 --> 2:42:28.600]  They're the ones and imagine
[2:42:28.600 --> 2:42:30.600]  there's such crybabies
[2:42:30.600 --> 2:42:32.600]  if a Republican had gone
[2:42:32.600 --> 2:42:34.600]  and done something like this with the media,
[2:42:34.600 --> 2:42:36.600]  with the Republican media calling for it,
[2:42:36.600 --> 2:42:38.600]  it'd be the end of the world. These people are
[2:42:38.600 --> 2:42:40.600]  so arrogant.
[2:42:40.600 --> 2:42:42.600]  Well, they are.
[2:42:42.600 --> 2:42:44.600]  I think it's important for us to realize
[2:42:44.600 --> 2:42:46.600]  your enemy
[2:42:46.600 --> 2:42:48.600]  is going to want to divide you
[2:42:48.600 --> 2:42:50.600]  and your enemy is going to be calling for violence.
[2:42:50.600 --> 2:42:52.600]  A leader
[2:42:52.600 --> 2:42:54.600]  calls for peace and a leader
[2:42:54.600 --> 2:42:56.600]  calls for unity.
[2:42:56.600 --> 2:42:58.600]  So I think we, the American people, need to
[2:42:58.600 --> 2:43:00.600]  watch and see who is it
[2:43:00.600 --> 2:43:02.600]  that's trying to bring about peace
[2:43:02.600 --> 2:43:04.600]  and unity. That's our friend.
[2:43:04.600 --> 2:43:06.600]  Well, Trump's been doing that. He's been promoting,
[2:43:06.600 --> 2:43:08.600]  bringing people together around the economy
[2:43:08.600 --> 2:43:10.600]  of freedom. He's been doing that.
[2:43:10.600 --> 2:43:12.600]  Yes, and just because
[2:43:12.600 --> 2:43:14.600]  radical left claim that he's not doesn't
[2:43:14.600 --> 2:43:16.600]  make it so. That's why I say
[2:43:16.600 --> 2:43:18.600]  watch the actions. Don't just listen
[2:43:18.600 --> 2:43:20.600]  to the
[2:43:20.600 --> 2:43:22.600]  false rhetoric. You can see the truth.
[2:43:22.600 --> 2:43:24.600]  What about the police and military?
[2:43:24.600 --> 2:43:26.600]  You've been a federal officer as well,
[2:43:26.600 --> 2:43:28.600]  Craig Sawyer.
[2:43:28.600 --> 2:43:30.600]  I mean, what's the sense of them right now?
[2:43:30.600 --> 2:43:32.600]  We know they back Trump overwhelmingly.
[2:43:32.600 --> 2:43:34.600]  We know there's a civil war inside the agencies.
[2:43:34.600 --> 2:43:36.600]  I see Trump with the people actually
[2:43:36.600 --> 2:43:38.600]  turning the corner. They've got all these fake polls out
[2:43:38.600 --> 2:43:40.600]  just like during the campaign, but I think Trump
[2:43:40.600 --> 2:43:42.600]  overall is winning the hearts and minds.
[2:43:42.600 --> 2:43:44.600]  That's why they're so desperate.
[2:43:44.600 --> 2:43:46.600]  I do too. I think
[2:43:46.600 --> 2:43:48.600]  they're getting desperate as they swirl the drain
[2:43:48.600 --> 2:43:50.600]  and they're like I said earlier, they're grasping
[2:43:50.600 --> 2:43:52.600]  at anything they can.
[2:43:52.600 --> 2:43:54.600]  And what I'm about is
[2:43:54.600 --> 2:43:56.600]  celebrating the problem solvers
[2:43:56.600 --> 2:43:58.600]  and not the problem causers like in
[2:43:58.600 --> 2:44:00.600]  the recent
[2:44:00.600 --> 2:44:02.600]  DC shooting on Steve Scalise.
[2:44:02.600 --> 2:44:04.600]  We've got
[2:44:04.600 --> 2:44:06.600]  police officers David Bailey
[2:44:06.600 --> 2:44:08.600]  and Crystal Griner who
[2:44:08.600 --> 2:44:10.600]  put an end to the violence
[2:44:10.600 --> 2:44:12.600]  put an end to the crisis there.
[2:44:12.600 --> 2:44:14.600]  So
[2:44:14.600 --> 2:44:16.600]  I'm about praising those who
[2:44:16.600 --> 2:44:18.600]  put a stop to the violence and
[2:44:18.600 --> 2:44:20.600]  instead of saying the names of those who perpetuate it.
[2:44:20.600 --> 2:44:22.600]  So I think
[2:44:22.600 --> 2:44:24.600]  the police law enforcement appreciate
[2:44:24.600 --> 2:44:26.600]  to President Trump the ones that I'm hearing
[2:44:26.600 --> 2:44:28.600]  because he knows
[2:44:28.600 --> 2:44:30.600]  they know that he's got our backs
[2:44:30.600 --> 2:44:32.600]  and it's just a matter of time.
[2:44:32.600 --> 2:44:34.600]  Like we said earlier, he's got
[2:44:34.600 --> 2:44:36.600]  to clean house. He's got to surround himself
[2:44:36.600 --> 2:44:38.600]  by people that at least have his back.
[2:44:38.600 --> 2:44:40.600]  Absolutely.
[2:44:40.600 --> 2:44:42.600]  Undoubtedly Trump being an office
[2:44:42.600 --> 2:44:44.600]  for six months, or five and a half months
[2:44:44.600 --> 2:44:46.600]  is moving hardcore against the pedophile rings.
[2:44:46.600 --> 2:44:48.600]  I think this is one of the central things
[2:44:48.600 --> 2:44:50.600]  they're very upset about. I don't want you to get any investigations
[2:44:50.600 --> 2:44:52.600]  of your film crew or what you're doing.
[2:44:52.600 --> 2:44:54.600]  Now you've run into major opposition trying
[2:44:54.600 --> 2:44:56.600]  to get your operation off the ground.
[2:44:56.600 --> 2:44:58.600]  What's the latest?
[2:44:58.600 --> 2:45:00.600]  Well, one of the latest is
[2:45:00.600 --> 2:45:02.600]  filling our board of advisors.
[2:45:02.600 --> 2:45:04.600]  We've got Dr. Judith Reisman
[2:45:04.600 --> 2:45:06.600]  who has been instrumental
[2:45:06.600 --> 2:45:08.600]  in blowing the whistle
[2:45:08.600 --> 2:45:10.600]  and shining the light on
[2:45:10.600 --> 2:45:12.600]  Sadomasochistic pedophile
[2:45:12.600 --> 2:45:14.600]  Alfred Kinsey's
[2:45:14.600 --> 2:45:16.600]  falsified studies on pedophilia
[2:45:16.600 --> 2:45:18.600]  and...
[2:45:18.600 --> 2:45:20.600]  That's right. He kept kids in cages.
[2:45:20.600 --> 2:45:22.600]  Yeah. He was a dark and creepy guy.
[2:45:22.600 --> 2:45:24.600]  The Liberals love him.
[2:45:24.600 --> 2:45:26.600]  By the way, the Liberals love Kinsey.
[2:45:26.600 --> 2:45:28.600]  He kept his own family in cages.
[2:45:28.600 --> 2:45:30.600]  Well, because
[2:45:30.600 --> 2:45:32.600]  they love him only because
[2:45:32.600 --> 2:45:34.600]  they've been disinformed about him.
[2:45:34.600 --> 2:45:36.600]  Intentionally disinformed.
[2:45:36.600 --> 2:45:38.600]  Once they learn the truth,
[2:45:38.600 --> 2:45:40.600]  Dr. Reisman knows the truth.
[2:45:40.600 --> 2:45:42.600]  She and I are working together
[2:45:42.600 --> 2:45:44.600]  to stroke
[2:45:44.600 --> 2:45:46.600]  new legislation to get back
[2:45:46.600 --> 2:45:48.600]  to sound, wholesome, real
[2:45:48.600 --> 2:45:50.600]  science
[2:45:50.600 --> 2:45:52.600]  to replace Dr. Kinsey's
[2:45:52.600 --> 2:45:54.600]  falsified studies that have caused
[2:45:54.600 --> 2:45:56.600]  two generations of pedophiles
[2:45:56.600 --> 2:45:58.600]  to be raised in the United States
[2:45:58.600 --> 2:46:00.600]  causing incalculable harm
[2:46:00.600 --> 2:46:02.600]  to the nation's youth.
[2:46:02.600 --> 2:46:04.600]  She's a beautiful soul.
[2:46:04.600 --> 2:46:06.600]  We've got Bob Hamer that went inside
[2:46:06.600 --> 2:46:08.600]  of Nambla under cover
[2:46:08.600 --> 2:46:10.600]  to help bring down some of those scumbags.
[2:46:10.600 --> 2:46:12.600]  We've got Jack Farmer.
[2:46:12.600 --> 2:46:14.600]  And by the way,
[2:46:14.600 --> 2:46:16.600]  I'm teleprompter free, so I go from memory.
[2:46:16.600 --> 2:46:18.600]  Nobody corrects me in the studio.
[2:46:18.600 --> 2:46:20.600]  I always mix up Kinsey and Skinner.
[2:46:20.600 --> 2:46:22.600]  One of them kept his own son in a cage
[2:46:22.600 --> 2:46:24.600]  until he committed suicide.
[2:46:24.600 --> 2:46:26.600]  His whole life from birth,
[2:46:26.600 --> 2:46:28.600]  like 12 years old, I think,
[2:46:28.600 --> 2:46:30.600]  and they would graft electrodes into their mouths.
[2:46:30.600 --> 2:46:32.600]  I've got footage of this film footage.
[2:46:32.600 --> 2:46:34.600]  I put it in a film. So it's either Skinner
[2:46:34.600 --> 2:46:36.600]  or Kinsey. The point is they were all
[2:46:36.600 --> 2:46:38.600]  into the sexualization of children.
[2:46:38.600 --> 2:46:40.600]  Yeah.
[2:46:40.600 --> 2:46:42.600]  Well, what
[2:46:42.600 --> 2:46:44.600]  Kinsey did was going around
[2:46:44.600 --> 2:46:46.600]  we went around to each state, state
[2:46:46.600 --> 2:46:48.600]  by state,
[2:46:48.600 --> 2:46:50.600]  politicking for his preferred views
[2:46:50.600 --> 2:46:52.600]  on, you know, basically
[2:46:52.600 --> 2:46:54.600]  condoning
[2:46:54.600 --> 2:46:56.600]  child rape
[2:46:56.600 --> 2:46:58.600]  to put it
[2:46:58.600 --> 2:47:00.600]  folks that don't know explain. He's well known.
[2:47:00.600 --> 2:47:02.600]  He went to the PTAs everywhere. Tell folks what he taught.
[2:47:02.600 --> 2:47:04.600]  Yeah. Well, he taught
[2:47:04.600 --> 2:47:06.600]  that children are sexual
[2:47:06.600 --> 2:47:08.600]  from birth. And so in his studies,
[2:47:08.600 --> 2:47:10.600]  he threw out all
[2:47:10.600 --> 2:47:12.600]  the findings that he didn't like and he took the findings
[2:47:12.600 --> 2:47:14.600]  from
[2:47:14.600 --> 2:47:16.600]  falsified studies that basically said,
[2:47:16.600 --> 2:47:18.600]  you know, all children are sexual from birth.
[2:47:18.600 --> 2:47:20.600]  And member Clinton, member Bill Clinton's first
[2:47:20.600 --> 2:47:22.600]  surgeon general nominee,
[2:47:22.600 --> 2:47:24.600]  Jocelyn Elder said, you know,
[2:47:24.600 --> 2:47:26.600]  that we needed to take the toddlers
[2:47:26.600 --> 2:47:28.600]  and teach him how to have sex. Remember?
[2:47:28.600 --> 2:47:30.600]  Well, it's in our elementary
[2:47:30.600 --> 2:47:32.600]  schools now. So
[2:47:32.600 --> 2:47:34.600]  Kinsey's falsified studies have
[2:47:34.600 --> 2:47:36.600]  invested our educational
[2:47:36.600 --> 2:47:38.600]  system, our laws, and our
[2:47:38.600 --> 2:47:40.600]  medical and psychological
[2:47:40.600 --> 2:47:42.600]  systems. So
[2:47:42.600 --> 2:47:44.600]  the laws are too soft on
[2:47:44.600 --> 2:47:46.600]  child rape. We're teaching children
[2:47:46.600 --> 2:47:48.600]  how to become victims of child rape
[2:47:48.600 --> 2:47:50.600]  in elementary school.
[2:47:50.600 --> 2:47:52.600]  They're learning all manner of perversions that young
[2:47:52.600 --> 2:47:54.600]  children don't need to be subjected
[2:47:54.600 --> 2:47:56.600]  to. And by the way, you're hard to get info
[2:47:56.600 --> 2:47:58.600]  out of because you don't get into stuff that, like, Crips investigations.
[2:47:58.600 --> 2:48:00.600]  But the pedophiles know everybody's
[2:48:00.600 --> 2:48:02.600]  after them. They're getting rounded up everywhere.
[2:48:02.600 --> 2:48:04.600]  What can you just get to the spirit of the
[2:48:04.600 --> 2:48:06.600]  battle right now and how big it is from
[2:48:06.600 --> 2:48:08.600]  your sources all over the world? What's happening
[2:48:08.600 --> 2:48:10.600]  currently? I know a lot of them also are falling down and hitting their
[2:48:10.600 --> 2:48:12.600]  heads.
[2:48:12.600 --> 2:48:14.600]  Well, if you
[2:48:14.600 --> 2:48:16.600]  look at the numbers online, you'll see that
[2:48:16.600 --> 2:48:18.600]  there are a lot of arrests going
[2:48:18.600 --> 2:48:20.600]  on there. There's a wide scope of this. A
[2:48:20.600 --> 2:48:22.600]  lot of people are wanting
[2:48:22.600 --> 2:48:24.600]  the big names. And I hope and pray
[2:48:24.600 --> 2:48:26.600]  that some of the big names will start to fall.
[2:48:26.600 --> 2:48:28.600]  But I know some of those larger federal
[2:48:28.600 --> 2:48:30.600]  cases take more time
[2:48:30.600 --> 2:48:32.600]  to make stick in the court of law
[2:48:32.600 --> 2:48:34.600]  with the lawyers that will defend anybody
[2:48:34.600 --> 2:48:36.600]  just to win a case. So
[2:48:36.600 --> 2:48:38.600]  especially when they're paid a ton of money.
[2:48:38.600 --> 2:48:40.600]  Now they can hold it up for two years. A lot of the state case, local cases
[2:48:40.600 --> 2:48:42.600]  are going very rapidly.
[2:48:42.600 --> 2:48:44.600]  But the larger federal cases will take a little
[2:48:44.600 --> 2:48:46.600]  bit of time. But what will happen
[2:48:46.600 --> 2:48:48.600]  you'll find is that once the first
[2:48:48.600 --> 2:48:50.600]  big name goes down, you'll start
[2:48:50.600 --> 2:48:52.600]  to see a domino effect because
[2:48:52.600 --> 2:48:54.600]  the research... And the globalists are acting
[2:48:54.600 --> 2:48:56.600]  really scared right now because I mean
[2:48:56.600 --> 2:48:58.600]  Trump's breathing down their neck.
[2:48:58.600 --> 2:49:00.600]  Yeah, well
[2:49:00.600 --> 2:49:02.600]  the tide's changing. The tide is
[2:49:02.600 --> 2:49:04.600]  changing for once.
[2:49:04.600 --> 2:49:06.600]  The veil of secrecy behind this
[2:49:06.600 --> 2:49:08.600]  child sex trafficking
[2:49:08.600 --> 2:49:10.600]  and satanic ritual abuse
[2:49:10.600 --> 2:49:12.600]  is being torn away
[2:49:12.600 --> 2:49:14.600]  and the American public is getting a glimpse
[2:49:14.600 --> 2:49:16.600]  at it. The genie's kind of out of the bottle
[2:49:16.600 --> 2:49:18.600]  now. It's just now
[2:49:18.600 --> 2:49:20.600]  emerging. And they'll try to deny it but just like
[2:49:20.600 --> 2:49:22.600]  the Catholic Church, it's coming out now.
[2:49:22.600 --> 2:49:24.600]  I mean look at the head of Penn State just got
[2:49:24.600 --> 2:49:26.600]  indicted for covering it up. I mean
[2:49:26.600 --> 2:49:28.600]  Sandusky's son just got indicted.
[2:49:28.600 --> 2:49:30.600]  It's happening.
[2:49:30.600 --> 2:49:32.600]  Yeah, well 60 minutes did a great
[2:49:32.600 --> 2:49:34.600]  special about what's going on in the UK.
[2:49:34.600 --> 2:49:36.600]  A lot of members of parliament
[2:49:36.600 --> 2:49:38.600]  implicated in this
[2:49:38.600 --> 2:49:40.600]  systematic child rape and
[2:49:40.600 --> 2:49:42.600]  human trafficking. Horrible ugly stuff.
[2:49:42.600 --> 2:49:44.600]  They're calling it the biggest scandal
[2:49:44.600 --> 2:49:46.600]  in UK history. So even NSM
[2:49:46.600 --> 2:49:48.600]  can't hold this back. Is that why they're so desperate?
[2:49:48.600 --> 2:49:50.600]  Or what else has got the globalist so
[2:49:50.600 --> 2:49:52.600]  panicked right now from your intel?
[2:49:52.600 --> 2:49:54.600]  Well it is. It's the exposure.
[2:49:54.600 --> 2:49:56.600]  You know, right now they're able to
[2:49:56.600 --> 2:49:58.600]  parade around and pretend to be
[2:49:58.600 --> 2:50:00.600]  respectable and
[2:50:00.600 --> 2:50:02.600]  honorable people
[2:50:02.600 --> 2:50:04.600]  of influence. Whereas really
[2:50:04.600 --> 2:50:06.600]  behind the scenes, they're weaklings. They're
[2:50:06.600 --> 2:50:08.600]  scumbags that are harming children and
[2:50:08.600 --> 2:50:10.600]  once people find that out
[2:50:10.600 --> 2:50:12.600]  their wealth
[2:50:12.600 --> 2:50:14.600]  and prestige will be taken from them.
[2:50:14.600 --> 2:50:16.600]  So it threatens everything.
[2:50:16.600 --> 2:50:18.600]  This is a fight between good and evil.
[2:50:18.600 --> 2:50:20.600]  So it's all on the line. That's why
[2:50:20.600 --> 2:50:22.600]  it's getting very, very crazy is
[2:50:22.600 --> 2:50:24.600]  the elite's grasp to the last
[2:50:24.600 --> 2:50:26.600]  hope of keeping this
[2:50:26.600 --> 2:50:28.600]  thing under wraps. But like I said,
[2:50:28.600 --> 2:50:30.600]  the genie's already creeping out.
[2:50:30.600 --> 2:50:32.600]  You're saying right now, we're seeing
[2:50:32.600 --> 2:50:34.600]  them flailing right now in a death battle.
[2:50:36.600 --> 2:50:38.600]  It really is.
[2:50:38.600 --> 2:50:40.600]  It's just the start of it though.
[2:50:40.600 --> 2:50:42.600]  That's why they're still trying to kill off people.
[2:50:42.600 --> 2:50:44.600]  Look, if
[2:50:44.600 --> 2:50:46.600]  pedophilia and child sex trafficking rings
[2:50:46.600 --> 2:50:48.600]  weren't not a big, a big
[2:50:48.600 --> 2:50:50.600]  issue, then why would they be
[2:50:50.600 --> 2:50:52.600]  bothering to kill everybody off like
[2:50:52.600 --> 2:50:54.600]  Seth Rich and the others?
[2:50:54.600 --> 2:50:56.600]  That's right, stay there. Dan, Stephen, Dustin, Jesse,
[2:50:56.600 --> 2:50:58.600]  you're called straight ahead.
[2:50:58.600 --> 2:51:00.600]  Hi, this is Ron Paul,
[2:51:00.600 --> 2:51:02.600]  former congressman and Republican presidential
[2:51:02.600 --> 2:51:04.600]  candidate. I love these summer months
[2:51:04.600 --> 2:51:06.600]  because this is when I get to enjoy the
[2:51:06.600 --> 2:51:08.600]  fresh fruits and vegetables that are being
[2:51:08.600 --> 2:51:10.600]  harvested on small farms and in our backyards.
[2:51:10.600 --> 2:51:12.600]  We all look forward
[2:51:12.600 --> 2:51:14.600]  to garden tomatoes and corn on the cob.
[2:51:14.600 --> 2:51:16.600]  Don't you wish there was a better way to preserve
[2:51:16.600 --> 2:51:18.600]  their true taste and flavors?
[2:51:18.600 --> 2:51:20.600]  I'm here to tell you that there is a better
[2:51:20.600 --> 2:51:22.600]  way. It's by using the amazing
[2:51:22.600 --> 2:51:24.600]  home freeze dryer from Harvest Right.
[2:51:24.600 --> 2:51:26.600]  I have a Harvest Right
[2:51:26.600 --> 2:51:28.600]  freeze dryer and use it to preserve the
[2:51:28.600 --> 2:51:30.600]  foods I love. Strawberries,
[2:51:30.600 --> 2:51:32.600]  apples, and even lasagna and ice cream
[2:51:32.600 --> 2:51:34.600]  can stay fresh for 25 years.
[2:51:34.600 --> 2:51:36.600]  And the best part of my freeze drying
[2:51:36.600 --> 2:51:38.600]  is my family and I have a supply
[2:51:38.600 --> 2:51:40.600]  of long lasting food on hand.
[2:51:40.600 --> 2:51:42.600]  So no matter what may come, we feel
[2:51:42.600 --> 2:51:44.600]  better prepared. We love
[2:51:44.600 --> 2:51:46.600]  our freeze dryer. To learn more

[2:54:08.600 --> 2:54:11.600]  for this segment and the next,
[2:54:11.600 --> 2:54:13.600]  and we've got John Rabbiport coming up.
[2:54:13.600 --> 2:54:15.600]  I'll host a little bit with him as well
[2:54:15.600 --> 2:54:19.560]  him as well in the fourth hour. The Daily Caller does a lot of great stuff. We link
[2:54:19.560 --> 2:54:24.440]  to him all the time. Carlson's been on the show. He listens to it. They keep writing
[2:54:24.440 --> 2:54:30.200]  hit pieces now that aren't true. Fact check. Did Tim Cain and Loretta Lynch call for blood
[2:54:30.200 --> 2:54:37.200]  and death in the streets? Well, remember Lynch last year said there were times for Black
[2:54:37.200 --> 2:54:41.080]  Lives Matter and back what they were doing. That was a big controversy. And they just
[2:54:41.080 --> 2:54:47.560]  say that, no, it's not true. But here's our article that's quotes out of videos. I mean,
[2:54:47.560 --> 2:54:55.360]  it's videos of them calling for action. The Democrats are everywhere calling for violence.
[2:54:55.360 --> 2:55:00.920]  I just, I guess all these Republicans are scared. They want to hedge their bets. I want to go
[2:55:00.920 --> 2:55:06.440]  to calls here, but real quick, Greg Scheuer, former Navy SEAL author, TV host, Patriot,
[2:55:06.440 --> 2:55:10.400]  that's getting a little pedophile network. Why do you think they're coming after info
[2:55:10.400 --> 2:55:17.200]  or so bad? I mean, it's crazy the lies. Well, you should be honored, Alex. You've gotten
[2:55:17.200 --> 2:55:21.640]  their attention. If you were no threat, they would not bother with you. They are they're
[2:55:21.640 --> 2:55:28.760]  validating you by by their attacks. So hold your head high, my friend. Well, I do. I just
[2:55:28.760 --> 2:55:32.640]  I just can't believe that it's like they're this pathetic. They're worried about me. I
[2:55:32.640 --> 2:55:37.120]  mean, quite frankly, I don't think how big I am. I think it's how small they are. Just
[2:55:37.120 --> 2:55:42.600]  crazy. Here's something else, Alex. Here's something else. You, you don't want to give
[2:55:42.600 --> 2:55:48.080]  yourself a lot of credit and it seems almost counterintuitive that a guy, if you don't see
[2:55:48.080 --> 2:55:52.240]  yourself as some big guy, it's hard to wrap your mind around the fact that they'll be
[2:55:52.240 --> 2:55:56.920]  threatened by you. I got the same thing when my intel sources let me know that two of the
[2:55:56.920 --> 2:56:01.800]  big groups were worried about my little organization. Dude, they block you within seconds of you
[2:56:01.800 --> 2:56:08.160]  posting stuff over and blocking your PayPal, the sites, all of it. I mean, they are on
[2:56:08.160 --> 2:56:12.880]  you in seconds. Yes, sir. Well, here's the thing though, Alex, you give yourself a little
[2:56:12.880 --> 2:56:20.800]  credit. The dynamic is this. There are so few people willing to stand up and draw their
[2:56:20.800 --> 2:56:25.240]  little sword and stand up against the giant and say, you know what, this goes no further.
[2:56:25.240 --> 2:56:30.320]  If no one else will stand up to you, I will do it. And that freaks them right out because
[2:56:30.320 --> 2:56:36.080]  so many other people are, are, they're weaker and they're, they're going to turn and take
[2:56:36.080 --> 2:56:40.680]  the path of least resistance and they're going to go with the flow. And that leads to tyranny.
[2:56:40.680 --> 2:56:45.880]  Well, let me explain to the tyrants what's happening then. I know history. I can't run
[2:56:45.880 --> 2:56:49.680]  and hide from my kids. They're going to get me all I can do is fight. It's not courage.
[2:56:49.680 --> 2:56:56.480]  It's survival. Yeah. Well, but you're that, that your actions are in fact a threat to
[2:56:56.480 --> 2:57:02.520]  them. Your voice is a threat to those who want to do our country harm. And that's why
[2:57:02.520 --> 2:57:07.240]  I appreciate you. I don't care about those that want to criticize you for your passion
[2:57:07.240 --> 2:57:11.400]  or your energy. I, you know, I got the pleasure of meeting you and hanging out with you a little
[2:57:11.400 --> 2:57:16.440]  bit while I was there. And I see where your heart is. So that, that's all I need to know.
[2:57:16.440 --> 2:57:19.280]  You're a patriot and trying to appreciate your brother, you too. I mean, we're fighting
[2:57:19.280 --> 2:57:23.120]  vampires. How can we not get upset? Dan and Indiana, go ahead. Thanks for holding your
[2:57:23.120 --> 2:57:30.320]  hand on the air with Craig Sawyer. Yes, sir. Go ahead. I have my own, I have my own trouble
[2:57:30.320 --> 2:57:39.240]  here with a teenager boys, black, who hate me for hanging a painted portrait of Trump
[2:57:39.240 --> 2:57:46.960]  that I painted myself on my house and they ripped it down Sunday. Then some teenagers
[2:57:46.960 --> 2:57:54.200]  came two o'clock in the morning and were menacing my house. Then I have a friend in Cleveland
[2:57:54.200 --> 2:58:01.480]  where Antifa is threatening her shop. You do not threaten our person's business and
[2:58:01.480 --> 2:58:10.120]  Antifa and Cleveland. And Alex, you are a career killer. You kill Prince, Pierce Morgan,
[2:58:10.120 --> 2:58:18.120]  now Megan Kelly. Now go after Stephen can compare and kill his career.
[2:58:18.120 --> 2:58:22.120]  Dan, stay there. Don't hang up. I want to hear about the intimidation folks are going
[2:58:22.120 --> 2:58:25.920]  through. Yeah, that's the crazy thing is the bullying, the level of it. Do a few more minutes
[2:58:25.920 --> 2:58:29.120]  with us, Craig Sawyer. I'll go us with us a little bit of you can if you got to go,
[2:58:29.120 --> 2:58:33.000]  understand. And then we'll come back to Dan and Ryan, Steve, Dustin and Jesse. I promise
[2:58:33.000 --> 2:58:38.640]  I'll get to those five calls before I hand the baton to John Rappaport. Stay with us.
[2:58:38.640 --> 2:58:42.800]  First hour, you're the power of the info or folks. They're scared of you. That's why
[2:58:42.800 --> 2:58:51.840]  they hate us. They're scared of you. Men, give your body the support it needs with

[2:59:51.960 --> 3:00:13.120]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:00:13.120 --> 3:00:19.280]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on
[3:00:19.280 --> 3:00:26.160]  and do nothing from the front lines of the information war. It's Alex Jones.
[3:00:26.160 --> 3:00:33.560]  I remember 27 years ago, there was almost nobody fighting the globalist. We were always
[3:00:33.560 --> 3:00:36.360]  on the front lines and now as the war gets bigger and bigger, we're still on the front
[3:00:36.360 --> 3:00:39.920]  lines. There's so many other great people out there. I just hate seeing people that
[3:00:39.920 --> 3:00:43.960]  hedge their bets to kind of play both sides. You don't want to sign on to the globalist
[3:00:43.960 --> 3:00:48.400]  folks. You don't want to sign on to child kidnappers and devil worshipers. You just don't
[3:00:48.400 --> 3:00:52.240]  want to be part of that. Dan in Indiana, you were talking about hanging up a pro Trump
[3:00:52.240 --> 3:00:57.400]  sign and people tearing it down. They're just buying the hype and I bet if you had a chance
[3:00:57.400 --> 3:01:00.760]  to actually talk to him, you could talk them out of it, but you're making some great points.
[3:01:00.760 --> 3:01:01.760]  Go ahead.
[3:01:01.760 --> 3:01:11.080]  Yes, I painted back in November a pro Trump portrait that I painted a portrait of Trump
[3:01:11.080 --> 3:01:17.680]  and I hung it on my house and I had a lot of negative people comment, but this Sunday
[3:01:17.680 --> 3:01:24.480]  was the first ever. They trespassed on my property, broad daylight. I lived next to
[3:01:24.480 --> 3:01:32.480]  a public park and everybody could see them, jump out of their cars, rip the banner down.
[3:01:32.480 --> 3:01:40.880]  I'll send you a copy of it so you can put it on your link. It has also a poster of Hillary
[3:01:40.880 --> 3:01:48.040]  Clinton as a witch. It says move, which get out of way. So they came back. That's better.
[3:01:48.040 --> 3:01:53.520]  That's family friendly, not move. Female dog move, which get out the way. That's a good
[3:01:53.520 --> 3:02:00.520]  idea. Yeah, she's wearing a black witch's hat, but they came back on Wednesday night
[3:02:00.520 --> 3:02:06.920]  and I'm out walking my dogs at 2am in the morning and they standing out there just looking
[3:02:06.920 --> 3:02:12.240]  at my house and I said, what are you looking at? And then they go, Trump this, Trump that,
[3:02:12.240 --> 3:02:17.960]  come on in the street and face us. I said, let me go back in my house, put my clothes
[3:02:17.960 --> 3:02:26.600]  on and when I went back out to the street, they were gone. I had earlier confrontation
[3:02:26.600 --> 3:02:35.040]  with teenage boys, seven in a group. When I was working on my driveway, they come yelling
[3:02:35.040 --> 3:02:39.840]  Trump this, Trump that, you voted for Trump. Why you vote for Trump? They won't even give
[3:02:39.840 --> 3:02:47.000]  you a time to answer their questions, but they're 15, 14. They're brainwashed at this
[3:02:47.000 --> 3:02:52.680]  young age. That was my next point, Dan. God bless you. Send this video of that at Showtipsinpoors.com.
[3:02:52.680 --> 3:02:55.800]  We don't post it soon again and again because we get a lot of stuff and miss things, but
[3:02:55.800 --> 3:03:02.600]  God bless you. Thank you, sir. Craig, this is what I'm talking about. It's like the media
[3:03:02.600 --> 3:03:07.560]  is like, a lot of people doing this mean well. How do you deal with some of that means well,
[3:03:07.560 --> 3:03:14.840]  but it's still dangerous? What do you do? Well, those people, you kind of slip them
[3:03:14.840 --> 3:03:20.440]  off to the side and let them learn as things progress. That's the media problem. Alex, they're
[3:03:20.440 --> 3:03:29.960]  being pumped full of disinformation by a ministry of propaganda, just like in a wartime situation.
[3:03:29.960 --> 3:03:35.480]  It's despicable and shameful what our so-called mainstream news media has resorted to. The
[3:03:35.480 --> 3:03:40.320]  hostility against the American people, the call for violence and the rhetoric that's
[3:03:40.320 --> 3:03:49.760]  coming out of these news channels is not only shameful, but a lot of it's seditious. I wouldn't
[3:03:49.760 --> 3:03:57.800]  be surprised to see some convictions just due to the amount of harm and damage that's
[3:03:57.800 --> 3:04:04.600]  coming from it because of the lies. Briefly, none of us want war. We hope to stop it. What
[3:04:04.600 --> 3:04:09.240]  happens if they really start a civil war with patriots and veterans and the people that
[3:04:09.240 --> 3:04:15.520]  actually work in this country? I mean, it's a joke. It's like the mouse that roared that
[3:04:15.520 --> 3:04:23.160]  they really think they can do this. Well, if you equate it to a threat against the president,
[3:04:23.160 --> 3:04:28.040]  he and the Secret Service have the right to bring in the National Guard if they need to
[3:04:28.040 --> 3:04:35.560]  or even contract companies that have got as many veterans as they need. It'd be foolish
[3:04:35.560 --> 3:04:40.920]  to start something like that because the opposition would be over their heads. Immediately, they'd
[3:04:40.920 --> 3:04:47.840]  become readily apparent. But it's disappointing to see how disinformed and misinformed they
[3:04:47.840 --> 3:04:53.200]  are. What are they fighting for? President Trump's brought back more jobs than we've
[3:04:53.200 --> 3:04:56.960]  seen in the US. Exactly. Craig, we'll talk to you soon. Thank you so much, brother.
[3:04:56.960 --> 3:05:02.920]  Doing a great job. While the anti-American, anti-Trump Democrats are looking up each other's
[3:05:02.920 --> 3:05:07.000]  rear ends for Trump-Russia collusion, the real collusion is hiding in plain sight. It should
[3:05:07.000 --> 3:05:10.200]  have come as no surprise when Comey didn't prosecute Hillary Clinton for the illegal
[3:05:10.200 --> 3:05:15.040]  email and server scandal. Comey and Clinton had a history. In 2004, while serving as Deputy
[3:05:15.040 --> 3:05:18.680]  Attorney General to the Justice Department, Comey narrowed the scope of the Sandy Berger
[3:05:18.680 --> 3:05:22.920]  investigation to seclude members of the Clinton administration who may have coordinated with
[3:05:22.920 --> 3:05:27.680]  Berger in the destruction of classified documents. Berger, Sheryl Mills, and now disgraced Loretta
[3:05:27.680 --> 3:05:32.320]  Lynch all worked together at the law firm that handled Clinton's tax returns. No wonder
[3:05:32.320 --> 3:05:36.960]  why Lynch didn't want Clinton's emails to be investigated or prosecuted. You throw that
[3:05:36.960 --> 3:05:41.200]  in with the fact Comey admitted he's the leaker and, well, we have a new investigation to
[3:05:41.200 --> 3:05:45.840]  focus on, don't we? No, we don't, because the Trump administration is busy trying to
[3:05:45.840 --> 3:05:51.080]  make America great again. But perhaps someday, a real investigation into real collusion will
[3:05:51.080 --> 3:05:56.280]  make it to Capitol Hill, and Lynch and Clinton will have their days to testify under oath.
[3:05:56.280 --> 3:05:59.000]  For Infowars.com, this is Owen Troyer.

[3:06:02.560 --> 3:06:07.400]  in stock at InfowarsStore.com, the first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week. I thought
[3:06:07.400 --> 3:06:11.320]  it would be a six-month supply for listeners. And since then, people are beating down our

[3:07:59.440 --> 3:08:07.280]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones, who claims that
[3:08:07.280 --> 3:08:15.080]  9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs. I don't know what happens in somebody's
[3:08:15.080 --> 3:08:22.880]  mind or how dark their heart must be to say things like that. The Russians ran an extensive
[3:08:22.880 --> 3:08:32.200]  information war campaign against my campaign to influence voters in the election and then
[3:08:32.200 --> 3:08:41.120]  they began to weaponize them and they began to have some of their allies within the internet
[3:08:41.120 --> 3:08:48.920]  world like Infowars. Take out pieces and begin to say the most outrageous, outlandish, absurd
[3:08:48.920 --> 3:08:54.600]  lies you can imagine. But Trump doesn't challenge these lies. He actually went on Jones' show
[3:08:54.600 --> 3:09:02.120]  and said, your reputation is amazing, I will not let you down.
[3:09:02.120 --> 3:09:08.840]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of
[3:09:08.840 --> 3:09:18.080]  the Infowar. I'll admit it, I like to fight. I'll admit
[3:09:18.080 --> 3:09:23.080]  it, I like what's happening. The scarier it gets, the worse it gets, the more surrounded
[3:09:23.080 --> 3:09:29.800]  I get. I just love it. It's like destiny's happening. I said a month and a half ago,
[3:09:29.800 --> 3:09:33.200]  we'd already launched this stuff and I'm behind schedule getting a lot of things done. We're
[3:09:33.200 --> 3:09:37.640]  like a month out from launching other shows. People like John Rappaport, he can host an
[3:09:37.640 --> 3:09:40.520]  hour a day, three hours a day, whatever he wants, he can have it. We're going to get
[3:09:40.520 --> 3:09:43.920]  them sponsors, we're going to pay all the crew, we're putting in these studios, we're
[3:09:43.920 --> 3:09:47.320]  doing it all right now. I just say that because I feel bad, I'm going to take over part of
[3:09:47.320 --> 3:09:56.160]  this hour he's agreed to do every week. No more fake news dot com. But I feel a kinship
[3:09:56.160 --> 3:10:02.920]  to humanity and I'll say that's easily. I really do. I am connected to everything and
[3:10:02.920 --> 3:10:11.520]  it's like, I'm not a sadomasochist. I'm not a masochist. I like to give pleasure, not
[3:10:11.520 --> 3:10:17.200]  pain. When I'm attacked by these horrible liars, it's like I'm being given Pulitzer
[3:10:17.200 --> 3:10:24.360]  prizes. It's the only thing that my, not even my ego, just my spirit, like says you're
[3:10:24.360 --> 3:10:36.880]  doing well. I don't want to have to say bye-bye to my children, but they don't have any future.
[3:10:36.880 --> 3:10:41.800]  Give men don't die in the service of freedom and they're going to kill us anyways if we
[3:10:41.800 --> 3:10:54.640]  don't stand up against them. That's a big secret. These are bad people and I'm just
[3:10:54.640 --> 3:11:01.960]  ashamed for humanity that I'm so prominent in the fight against these people. But I know
[3:11:01.960 --> 3:11:06.960]  there are so many men smarter, better looking, more well spoken than I am, but they're too
[3:11:06.960 --> 3:11:12.280]  smart. See, they go with what's easy. They, they play both sides. They, they want a bigger
[3:11:12.280 --> 3:11:15.840]  house, a bigger pool and I'm a free market guy. I'm not saying that's just bad, but
[3:11:15.840 --> 3:11:25.920]  it's not my God. And I see the horrible things they're doing to humanity and then I see them
[3:11:25.920 --> 3:11:32.560]  attacking us and Tom Brokow saying, I am a complete racist. He, you know, he was this
[3:11:32.560 --> 3:11:38.000]  fancy term that I'm this, I'm this total racist and they don't even show a clip. It's not
[3:11:38.000 --> 3:11:44.320]  that he hurts me calling me a racist. He hurts me that he wasn't that bad when I was a kid
[3:11:44.320 --> 3:11:50.160]  growing up or in college or when, you know, or 30 years old when he retired. Now I'm 43,
[3:11:50.160 --> 3:11:56.840]  44. It's that he's such a piece of crap as a fellow human seeing him so fallen. That's
[3:11:56.840 --> 3:12:03.560]  how he wounds me. Cause I could fall as far as he did and I'm afraid I don't want to be
[3:12:03.560 --> 3:12:11.800]  that man. Daughtering up there looking like the crypt keeper, you know, just spewing with
[3:12:11.800 --> 3:12:18.480]  a whole nest of people lies. It's not about me. It's a lie to everybody. It's that we're
[3:12:18.480 --> 3:12:29.480]  this fallen with this desperate of an elite. And then I see Trump crude and selfish, classic
[3:12:29.480 --> 3:12:35.620]  German Scott, like King Kong and the Empire States pulling trying to swat off the airplanes
[3:12:35.620 --> 3:12:43.160]  attacking him. I see him so big up there like hercules and his great, great, great, great
[3:12:43.160 --> 3:12:49.240]  test. And then I look around and I'm on top of the Empire States building to swatting
[3:12:49.240 --> 3:12:57.080]  at the airplanes. And it's just like, this is insane. Our enemy is so weak that a guy
[3:12:57.080 --> 3:13:01.880]  that owns casinos and hotels is their arch enemy. And some guy in Texas on a couple of
[3:13:01.880 --> 3:13:06.440]  radio stations, their enemy, it's like a paradox. It's like, it's not that we're that strong.
[3:13:06.440 --> 3:13:11.240]  They're that weak. And then I look at humanity and I think, is humanity that bad? Are they
[3:13:11.240 --> 3:13:16.560]  this pathetic? How the hell did we get like this? Because I don't see humanity's weaknesses
[3:13:16.560 --> 3:13:21.120]  of strength for me. I see it as my own weakness. The last John Rubenport, what he thinks, he's
[3:13:21.120 --> 3:13:27.680]  always got the perfect, you know, deep edge to whatever is happening. And then a few calls
[3:13:27.680 --> 3:13:32.000]  on the guy here and let him take over. She'll have more showtime when they ever want it.
[3:13:32.000 --> 3:13:35.960]  No more fake news.com. But here's Tom Brokaw of all the clips I haven't gotten to the view
[3:13:35.960 --> 3:13:44.800]  and 20 clips from CNN. But they, they roll out Tom Brokaw, who looks like he's about
[3:13:44.800 --> 3:13:52.240]  to die to go, Alex Jones is a total racist. I mean, this is what you've got. Here it is.
[3:13:52.240 --> 3:13:58.320]  The whole game is to let me play gotcha. Let me, let me show you how me or I can be. There's
[3:13:58.320 --> 3:14:03.080]  a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones, for example. But the fact is that
[3:14:03.080 --> 3:14:08.400]  he is an unalloyed racist, a man whose outs are pulling the pin on the grenade every day
[3:14:08.400 --> 3:14:15.440]  and he has six million viewers who are paying attention to him. And the parents at Newtown
[3:14:15.440 --> 3:14:19.880]  are saying they're hearing from his followers all the time. They buy into what he is saying,
[3:14:19.880 --> 3:14:25.400]  which is partly not true. So at some point, there's got to be a coming together of the
[3:14:25.400 --> 3:14:30.360]  political culture. It's never going to be kumbaya. We don't expect that because out
[3:14:30.360 --> 3:14:35.560]  of that tension can come with things. But I don't remember in my lifetime and I'm a
[3:14:35.560 --> 3:14:41.840]  pretty good student of history when this country was at the slaughterheads with such great
[3:14:41.840 --> 3:14:44.880]  consequences that can result from all of this.
[3:14:44.880 --> 3:14:52.920]  So Tom Brokaw and it's like so pathetic. It's, it's like beyond cathartic in a negative
[3:14:52.920 --> 3:14:58.000]  way. It's like they don't show a clip. They don't show proof. John Robbaport, separate
[3:14:58.000 --> 3:15:03.360]  from myself or you or anybody. What moment have we reached in history where this is happening?
[3:15:03.360 --> 3:15:08.400]  Well, I think we can take our cue from the clip that you just showed. Look at the other
[3:15:08.400 --> 3:15:15.240]  people in the clip. That's what I was doing. They're like stone statues. They really don't
[3:15:15.240 --> 3:15:21.240]  have any idea what he's referring to. You know, they're just sitting there going, what
[3:15:21.240 --> 3:15:28.400]  are we doing here? What is this? As you say, they roll out the skeleton who looks like
[3:15:28.400 --> 3:15:34.120]  he is, you know, been dug up out of a graveyard and he doesn't know what he's talking about
[3:15:34.120 --> 3:15:41.640]  either. He just took his cue from somebody who passed along a lie to him.
[3:15:41.640 --> 3:15:44.040]  That's it. They're soulless. Again, you just did it again.
[3:15:44.040 --> 3:15:51.040]  Yeah, they don't have, there's nothing there. It's like a shell covering dust.
[3:15:51.040 --> 3:15:55.280]  You know, they hate us because we still have our souls and we don't say that arrogantly.
[3:15:55.280 --> 3:16:01.640]  Thank God. Yeah. I mean, you know, they've trapped inside
[3:16:01.640 --> 3:16:06.800]  their own prison and they can't get out. They wouldn't have the first idea of how to get
[3:16:06.800 --> 3:16:14.800]  out. All they can do is rail against the people that they see as competitors. Okay. I mean,
[3:16:14.800 --> 3:16:21.960]  that's the level at which this is really existing. Your program, your website, other independent
[3:16:21.960 --> 3:16:28.200]  media are pulling millions of people away from them and they are the keepers of the
[3:16:28.200 --> 3:16:33.280]  crypt that have all the lies in them. And so they have to keep on dispensing the lies
[3:16:33.280 --> 3:16:39.080]  because that's all they can do. And now they suddenly look around and they say, you know,
[3:16:39.080 --> 3:16:44.880]  our domain is being threatened. So now we have to, what are we going to do? Let's, let's
[3:16:44.880 --> 3:16:50.880]  get in Broca. Dig them up. Dig them up out of the ground. Bring them in. He's the grand
[3:16:50.880 --> 3:16:57.560]  daddy of grand daddies. And we'll just sit here like stones and listen to him. It goes
[3:16:57.560 --> 3:17:04.040]  over like lead. It's like nothing. I mean, if I, that's right, their greatest weapon,
[3:17:04.040 --> 3:17:11.040]  Dan rather Tom Broca, it does nothing. Yeah. I mean, how would you feel or how would I
[3:17:11.040 --> 3:17:20.160]  feel if we were hosting that show? You know, in five seconds, we'd say, wake up guys. Hey,
[3:17:20.160 --> 3:17:26.160]  hello. Hello. Life is here. Can we get some actual live something or other going, but
[3:17:26.160 --> 3:17:30.280]  they're all reading off scripts so they're not allowed to be real. That's right. They
[3:17:30.280 --> 3:17:36.560]  can't, they can't depart. If they depart, they get fired. If somebody actually suddenly
[3:17:36.560 --> 3:17:42.640]  said, look, uh, I got something on my mind. I want to say so everybody shut up and listen.
[3:17:42.640 --> 3:17:49.040]  And they went off on some kind of uncontrolled rant that just showed that they were walking
[3:17:49.040 --> 3:17:55.760]  dead and they were trying to break out of that somehow. That would be the adequate response
[3:17:55.760 --> 3:18:03.320]  from these corpses, but they can't even do that. All they can do is sit around like statues.
[3:18:03.320 --> 3:18:08.040]  It's amazing. It's like death in life. And they've gone from being arrogant now to like
[3:18:08.040 --> 3:18:15.520]  horrified scared. Is that good though? Well, I don't know if it's good. I mean, it's just
[3:18:15.520 --> 3:18:22.720]  the way it is. What else can you do? You can't negotiate with people like this. You can't
[3:18:22.720 --> 3:18:29.240]  say, look, we don't want to push you over the edge if we can help it. You can't do that.
[3:18:29.240 --> 3:18:34.240]  They don't even understand what you're talking about. You can't say, look, we'd like to
[3:18:34.240 --> 3:18:38.120]  know exactly. They don't get they've been running us over killing us and we just want
[3:18:38.120 --> 3:18:43.400]  to live. They think cause we're fighting for our lives. We're attacking them. Yeah. They
[3:18:43.400 --> 3:18:50.400]  say, uh, if you said, I want to help bring your spirit back from the dead. Okay. I know
[3:18:50.400 --> 3:18:56.920]  you're dead. You feel dead. You look dead. They wouldn't know what you're talking about.
[3:18:56.920 --> 3:19:01.960]  They're just that was the thing about Kelly. I've never been around a woman cause an old
[3:19:01.960 --> 3:19:05.800]  lady that has spirit. I'm attracted to not sexually, but attractive. She had no spirit.
[3:19:05.800 --> 3:19:11.540]  She was literally like a robot. Even when she acted like a woman, it was totally fake.
[3:19:11.540 --> 3:19:16.360]  I've been interviewed by people like that. I had somebody show up at my apartment once
[3:19:16.360 --> 3:19:22.480]  long time ago, a major kind of network. Okay, we're going to do this now and yes and yes
[3:19:22.480 --> 3:19:30.200]  and whatever. And I kept looking for any sign of life or humanity or something going on.
[3:19:30.200 --> 3:19:38.720]  It was like she had sold her soul on the way up, you know, to get to where she was and
[3:19:38.720 --> 3:19:44.440]  she knew that she wasn't totally there yet, but she was almost there and she was just
[3:19:44.440 --> 3:19:49.560]  a robot moving straight ahead. Yeah. You just want to know when you get there, you realize
[3:19:49.560 --> 3:19:54.200]  you were conned. You were, you were taken to hell. They, they, they transport themselves
[3:19:54.200 --> 3:20:00.640]  of this place and then it's a total emptiness. Yeah. That's right. Can you imagine what happens
[3:20:00.640 --> 3:20:04.960]  if you win that game and you're sitting on top of the pile? To me, that would be the
[3:20:04.960 --> 3:20:11.360]  very worst thing that could happen because then you really have no way out. You fought
[3:20:11.360 --> 3:20:15.280]  after all your life to get to this place that you thought was going to be, you know, some
[3:20:15.280 --> 3:20:23.960]  kind of news nirvana and now you're there and you're all alone and you see all these
[3:20:23.960 --> 3:20:30.760]  robots around you. You're sitting on top of the little hill and life is drained away and
[3:20:30.760 --> 3:20:36.800]  you've got nothing. Man, that's some fate. That's some destiny that I would not like
[3:20:36.800 --> 3:20:44.240]  to taste. That reminds me of the Christmas Carol, but he sees it and finally turns back.
[3:20:44.240 --> 3:20:48.720]  The problem is to do those evil things. The only lie of C.S. Lewis is by the time you've
[3:20:48.720 --> 3:20:55.160]  been willing to do all that, God doesn't take your soul. You, you give it up to be dehumanized,
[3:20:55.160 --> 3:20:59.560]  to get that temporal power. And by the time you get there, you can't turn back cause you've
[3:20:59.560 --> 3:21:06.080]  gone so far. Christmas Carol is a great analogy. That's exactly what happened. So he turned
[3:21:06.080 --> 3:21:10.960]  around because that's the way Dickens wrote it. You know, we're going to visit him with
[3:21:10.960 --> 3:21:17.480]  enough ghosts so that it shows him what his life has become and how dead and horrible
[3:21:17.480 --> 3:21:27.200]  and cruel he is and he sees it and he, you know, weeps. He weeps to see what he's become.
[3:21:27.200 --> 3:21:35.480]  These people don't weep. They don't do it. They just keep on going and they have no life
[3:21:35.480 --> 3:21:43.800]  in them. I mean, I've met some of them along the way. Talk to them. They just shut down
[3:21:43.800 --> 3:21:50.560]  completely, even the best of them, even the best of them. Nothing left.
[3:21:50.560 --> 3:21:55.280]  All right, I want you to take over my friend. I got three callers and holding for over
[3:21:55.280 --> 3:22:00.320]  an hour or close to an hour. I appreciate him doing it. It's just, it's the energy level.
[3:22:00.320 --> 3:22:03.480]  Do you agree with that? The energy level? I want to get all metaphysical or new age.
[3:22:03.480 --> 3:22:08.920]  It's not the science, the technology, the information, the quickening, the singularity,
[3:22:08.920 --> 3:22:13.720]  whether we have a total singularity or partial one, you can feel the consciousness of the
[3:22:13.720 --> 3:22:17.560]  planet rising and that's what's horrifying these people.
[3:22:17.560 --> 3:22:23.760]  Yeah, it's like it's bumping up against the ceiling and it's punching holes in the ceiling.
[3:22:23.760 --> 3:22:30.320]  People are emerging who are awake, conscious, realized how they bought into the big con
[3:22:30.320 --> 3:22:37.000]  all their lives and they're not going to do it anymore. And those people in major media
[3:22:37.000 --> 3:22:44.320]  centers are looking and seeing this is happening. They're really jealous, Alex. Let's put it
[3:22:44.320 --> 3:22:52.360]  the way it is. They see people waking up and they wish they could too, but they can't.
[3:22:52.360 --> 3:22:57.280]  And they're trapped. So they have to just try to spew as much as they can.
[3:22:57.280 --> 3:23:01.760]  That's it because it's so freeing to walk down a beach and have your belly hanging out
[3:23:01.760 --> 3:23:05.400]  and not care what people think because you have a soul and you love them and you don't
[3:23:05.400 --> 3:23:09.440]  care or to not care if you don't agree with the establishment and they're attached to
[3:23:09.440 --> 3:23:15.840]  not the opposer anymore to be conscious and open and real is like graduating into humanity.
[3:23:15.840 --> 3:23:19.040]  And then we're not on a power trip that we've done that. We look over here and feel pathetic
[3:23:19.040 --> 3:23:23.160]  that our own species is like this and they're doing everything they can to stop that and
[3:23:23.160 --> 3:23:28.120]  you look at these people with their billions of dollars that serve evil. They are the greatest
[3:23:28.120 --> 3:23:32.440]  slaves. It's like you said, they compete to become the greatest slave to give up their
[3:23:32.440 --> 3:23:36.680]  most humanity so they can be part of this court of idiots.
[3:23:36.680 --> 3:23:44.640]  Exactly. Exactly. That's the irony of the whole thing. They think that if they climb
[3:23:44.640 --> 3:23:49.020]  that ladder that at the end of the ladder is going to be the thing that they've been
[3:23:49.020 --> 3:23:55.160]  yearning for all their lives that they've lost. And of course, it's just the opposite.
[3:23:55.160 --> 3:24:01.200]  It's worse. It's horrible at the top of that particular ladder where they get to. I mean,
[3:24:01.200 --> 3:24:06.680]  look at a guy like Zuckerberg, right? I have to imagine that he was just kind of a crazy
[3:24:06.680 --> 3:24:13.240]  talented kid in a little dorm room in Harvard and he had this idea and sure he got support
[3:24:13.240 --> 3:24:19.520]  and funding and some of it was like, you know, cutouts of CIA money and so on. But okay,
[3:24:19.520 --> 3:24:23.800]  whatever. And he builds this thing and all of a sudden it turns into an empire and he
[3:24:23.800 --> 3:24:31.920]  starts to think, I can get everything I've ever wanted. I can be recognized in a way
[3:24:31.920 --> 3:24:35.880]  that's not like a geek anymore and people won't look down at me if I just keep getting
[3:24:35.880 --> 3:24:41.280]  richer and richer and bigger and bigger. And now he's gotten to this point where I know
[3:24:41.280 --> 3:24:46.360]  he looks around and he's still got a big puffed up ego, but he's getting close to the point
[3:24:46.360 --> 3:24:53.160]  where he's going to be sitting there one day realizing that he's totally dead inside.
[3:24:53.160 --> 3:25:01.200]  And that's his reward for going the way he went. He's totally dead. Totally.
[3:25:01.200 --> 3:25:06.600]  Whereas the opposite right now, if you're fighting for Renaissance and against globalism,
[3:25:06.600 --> 3:25:11.840]  the consciousness is so fulfilling, it's like a drug so powerful you can't hardly stand
[3:25:11.840 --> 3:25:15.480]  it. Look at what happens when you can get behind
[3:25:15.480 --> 3:25:23.400]  a microphone and say what's really on your mind. That's another thing these people are
[3:25:23.400 --> 3:25:33.160]  horrendously jealous of. You can go on every day and say what the truth is, your truth,
[3:25:33.160 --> 3:25:38.280]  the truth you've discovered. Unfiltered. Unfiltered. It's the freedom. We can be individuals.
[3:25:38.280 --> 3:25:43.200]  It doesn't mean our truth is perfect, but it's real. It came from a human.
[3:25:43.200 --> 3:25:52.320]  Right. And how does that make somebody feel? Makes them feel alive, alert, energetic, expanded.
[3:25:52.320 --> 3:25:57.800]  You know, all the things that you want. And here they are all locked up in prison sitting
[3:25:57.800 --> 3:26:03.560]  there and now the news. And here's a horrible guy that we want to talk about here with our
[3:26:03.560 --> 3:26:11.200]  granddaddy Tom Brocaw. They got nothing. They're just dust inside a shell.
[3:26:11.200 --> 3:26:16.320]  That's actually what scares me the most is they are so pathetic and grasping. It's like,
[3:26:16.320 --> 3:26:22.000]  is this a Twilight Zone episode? I mean, it's what it looked like to me. I could put that
[3:26:22.000 --> 3:26:28.800]  right into Twilight Zone, what you showed with Brocaw there. To me, that's like, look
[3:26:28.800 --> 3:26:35.840]  at these people. Dead. All dead talking about what supposedly is important.
[3:26:35.840 --> 3:26:41.680]  It's like their ghost because they gave up their life talking about the real world and
[3:26:41.680 --> 3:26:47.280]  we're alive. It's like they're dead. We're alive. We're alive. They sleep. It's like
[3:26:47.280 --> 3:26:52.300]  they literally bought into the Matrix and then they're mad that we're not part of it.
[3:26:52.300 --> 3:26:55.920]  It's crazy. Yeah, they're very mad that we're not part
[3:26:55.920 --> 3:27:03.720]  of it. They look at people in independent media and they say, why are they so energetic?
[3:27:03.720 --> 3:27:11.160]  Why are they so expressive? What's going on? Do we have to stop that? We have to stop that.
[3:27:11.160 --> 3:27:16.800]  We don't understand it. We don't like it. We have to stop that. Yeah, because it reminds
[3:27:16.800 --> 3:27:23.640]  them that there's this thing called life and they don't have it. They threw it away.
[3:27:23.640 --> 3:27:28.280]  What is it about so many powerful people in the system? They are like dead and they get
[3:27:28.280 --> 3:27:32.880]  off on the fact they're so robotic. Yeah, they love that. I mean, it's all
[3:27:32.880 --> 3:27:41.000]  they've got left. It's like the private who goes up the ranks and somehow becomes the
[3:27:41.000 --> 3:27:48.840]  general in an army dedicated to endless war. You get to the top of that and you're completely
[3:27:48.840 --> 3:27:55.160]  dead. Well, what do you got left? You got nothing but control left. There's nothing
[3:27:55.160 --> 3:27:59.880]  you can do except say, I will control all of these things and I will keep going and
[3:27:59.880 --> 3:28:07.200]  make it tighter and tighter, control and control and control. And that's just one death experienced
[3:28:07.200 --> 3:28:15.560]  after another. One more degree of death. Wow. I got three callers. I got to go too far.
[3:28:15.560 --> 3:28:18.400]  I got out of here. I'm just hung up. Ryan in Kentucky. Thanks for holding her on the
[3:28:18.400 --> 3:28:25.960]  air and Steve. Yeah. Yeah, thank you. I look just good to talk to you. This last Monday
[3:28:25.960 --> 3:28:30.920]  I was listening to your show on my phone and I stopped over here at the Myers and I did
[3:28:30.920 --> 3:28:37.160]  out my truck and have my phone with me and I'm trying to convert it over to my headset.
[3:28:37.160 --> 3:28:40.440]  But it's blurring and everybody around me can hear it as I'm getting out and this lady
[3:28:40.440 --> 3:28:47.120]  comes up and she says, are you listening to Alex Jones? And I said, but yeah, actually
[3:28:47.120 --> 3:28:54.320]  I am. She's about in early 20s, you know, a millennial blind headed lady. And she just
[3:28:54.320 --> 3:29:01.960]  starts going on and on about how you preach and that Trump preaches white man power and
[3:29:01.960 --> 3:29:08.640]  or, you know, white privilege. And I said, ma'am, I said, you're white too. And I said,
[3:29:08.640 --> 3:29:13.520]  do you ever listen to anything that Alex actually says? I said, do you not realize that you're
[3:29:13.520 --> 3:29:19.120]  going to be caught up in your millennial world? You're going to become enslaved to the government
[3:29:19.120 --> 3:29:25.000]  system? Do you not actually listen to what he's saying? And she just went off and finally
[3:29:25.000 --> 3:29:29.120]  I mean, she was actually between me and my truck where I couldn't really get around comfortably.
[3:29:29.120 --> 3:29:32.880]  And I finally had to tell the lady I said, listen, man, I said, hold on, Ryan, I'm glad
[3:29:32.880 --> 3:29:36.800]  you held on to come back to you. And then Steve, then John Rappaport takes over. No more fake
[3:29:36.800 --> 3:29:40.600]  news.com. It's always great to talk to my little listen to the show and he doesn't find
[3:29:40.600 --> 3:29:45.960]  his own show and videos and things in his books. No more fake news.com. Alex Jones info wars.com.
[3:29:45.960 --> 3:29:52.160]  Ryan, don't hang up on the rest of the story. We're on the March, the empires on the run.
[3:29:52.160 --> 3:30:02.040]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. The liberal destruction of culture continues.
[3:30:02.040 --> 3:30:06.360]  In case you haven't heard, in a tragic case of what could be considered child abuse, season
[3:30:06.360 --> 3:30:11.000]  Will Ward has transformed her son, Ethan, into a cross dressing drag queen. But while
[3:30:11.000 --> 3:30:15.400]  this parading around of your child dressing in drag for your own personal benefit should
[3:30:15.400 --> 3:30:20.480]  be considered child abuse, in fact, it's quite the opposite. In Ontario, Canada, Bill 89,
[3:30:20.480 --> 3:30:25.020]  the Youth and Family Services Act now includes language for the proper treatment of children
[3:30:25.020 --> 3:30:29.920]  in regard to their gender identity and expression. So if your boy wants to be a girl and you
[3:30:29.920 --> 3:30:33.840]  tell your boy that's not natural or not in my home, then the government can take your
[3:30:33.840 --> 3:30:38.340]  kid. And with Bill nine in the left trying to convince everyone in gender fluidity,
[3:30:38.340 --> 3:30:42.280]  this could become a major concern for some households. Perhaps this is why here in the
[3:30:42.280 --> 3:30:47.120]  United States, we now have at least 20 transsexuals who will be running for office in the next
[3:30:47.120 --> 3:30:51.360]  round of elections. But governments are getting ahead of this trend, making sure if you feel
[3:30:51.360 --> 3:30:55.480]  this is an unnatural thing, you don't speak up because the government might take your
[3:30:55.480 --> 3:31:00.400]  kids for info wars.com. This is Owen Schreuer. Alex Jones here to tell you about how you
[3:31:00.400 --> 3:31:04.400]  can help spread liberty worldwide. I'm also enjoying what I have found to be the best

[3:32:26.200 --> 3:32:31.560]  have just run out of my super female. I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking
[3:32:31.560 --> 3:32:37.120]  it again, hitting the gym once again. Very exciting feeling great looking good. So and
[3:32:37.120 --> 3:32:43.040]  I know my hair is luxurious once again. So obviously the super female is amazing. I love

[3:32:48.560 --> 3:32:53.440]  is life changing that I would suggest it's nascent iodine survival shield x2. It's got

[3:33:10.880 --> 3:33:17.200]  listening to the Alex Jones show. I've been on there 22 years and I've never violated
[3:33:17.200 --> 3:33:22.160]  an off the record conversation. I've never given up a source either unless the source
[3:33:22.160 --> 3:33:29.720]  wanted to be given up. But Megan Kelly lied to me and I got tape of it. And she edited
[3:33:29.720 --> 3:33:34.120]  the interview together too. Supposing an error this Sunday. And that's why I said, don't
[3:33:34.120 --> 3:33:37.520]  air it because then I clicked. I said, I was gonna error about two, three weeks. And then
[3:33:37.520 --> 3:33:42.040]  they went, Oh, it's Aaron next Sunday. And I went father's day. And I remember the questions
[3:33:42.040 --> 3:33:46.120]  as a father to other fathers. What do you say? It's just like all those Super Bowl ads
[3:33:46.120 --> 3:33:53.480]  were anti dad, anti father. Remember, it's just these people are demonic. So I want to
[3:33:53.480 --> 3:33:58.160]  finish up with Ryan and finish up with Steve and let our great host here again, he'll have
[3:33:58.160 --> 3:34:04.400]  more comedy once soon, John Rappaport, finish up. But we run out of time here. There's so
[3:34:04.400 --> 3:34:10.280]  much every major show, misrepresenting one. I've said a lot about babies and incubators
[3:34:10.280 --> 3:34:14.800]  killing them. My listeners question new town. There was a lot of anomalies. I'm not saying
[3:34:14.800 --> 3:34:20.320]  if it happened, I don't believe the parents. I'm saying we have to question. And when I'm
[3:34:20.320 --> 3:34:24.120]  the guy that first says something, I'll take credit. I was not the first. Our listeners
[3:34:24.120 --> 3:34:28.560]  got really mad at me about new town. You know, when I when I first thought it might be real,
[3:34:28.560 --> 3:34:32.520]  they pointed out all the anomalies, but I'll get John Rappaport's take on that. But here's
[3:34:32.520 --> 3:34:39.960]  whoopie Goldberg and the view who wanted me on. I guess it was tomorrow. And I went ahead.
[3:34:39.960 --> 3:34:42.880]  You know, I went ahead and canceled it. And then that's the New York Times. They said,
[3:34:42.880 --> 3:34:46.480]  oh, I'm afraid. No, I don't want to be there with five women yelling over me and you don't
[3:34:46.480 --> 3:34:52.400]  call me a Nazi and stuff like that. It's not that I'm afraid to go. It's just that.
[3:34:52.400 --> 3:34:55.680]  What is the point? Let let them make up their own lives. I mean, I'm already on too many
[3:34:55.680 --> 3:35:00.120]  shows. I don't want to miss my family. I don't want to leave town, but I'm going to respond
[3:35:00.120 --> 3:35:06.400]  to them here because they built a straw man and then I attacked dead children and attacked,
[3:35:06.400 --> 3:35:12.360]  you know, the families. That's the talking point. And let me tell you, I've been banned
[3:35:12.360 --> 3:35:16.120]  on mainstream media, not that I even need to be on there for a while. Suddenly, about
[3:35:16.120 --> 3:35:23.440]  three weeks ago, we get like 30 requests from TV, international, the views, CNN, Fox News,
[3:35:23.440 --> 3:35:28.640]  you know, just everything because they decided, okay, let's go after him. Instead of just
[3:35:28.640 --> 3:35:32.280]  ignoring, let's go after him because they realized we're just growing despite them
[3:35:32.280 --> 3:35:36.600]  ignoring us. In fact, it's almost bad when I go on MSN because my listeners asked, what
[3:35:36.600 --> 3:35:41.760]  are you doing there? So we've now reached that tipping point. And then so you have these
[3:35:41.760 --> 3:35:46.040]  holier than those, but I almost want to go on live and say, okay, I'll still come maybe
[3:35:46.040 --> 3:35:50.200]  next week, but they won't let me. I'm going to say they lied about babies and incubators
[3:35:50.200 --> 3:35:53.280]  having their brains bashed out. Of course I questioned it, but I've been taken out of
[3:35:53.280 --> 3:35:57.600]  context. They go, oh, you're backing off it. No, we always looked at all the angles. That's
[3:35:57.600 --> 3:36:03.160]  what we do. It's not like some set directive comes down. You know, he says the firefighters
[3:36:03.160 --> 3:36:07.640]  blew up the World Trade Centers. Never said that. They just lie. I said, our government
[3:36:07.640 --> 3:36:11.400]  worked with radical Islam. There was a coverup. That's now been proven. And it's because the
[3:36:11.400 --> 3:36:16.960]  John Rappaports and the Matt drudges and the Donald Trump's been proven right. They're
[3:36:16.960 --> 3:36:21.280]  so pissed because say what you want about Trump or John Rappaport or anybody or a Matt
[3:36:21.280 --> 3:36:26.360]  drudge, they're their own men and that's what the technocrats don't like. So I asked Rappaport
[3:36:26.360 --> 3:36:30.160]  sometime in a full hour interview, what is it up at the top of that pyramid? We know
[3:36:30.160 --> 3:36:35.480]  it's Luciferianism, pedophilia, evil, occultism. They believe they're talking to offworld stuff,
[3:36:35.480 --> 3:36:40.040]  whether that's real or not. That's their cosmology. They don't see themselves as human. Maybe
[3:36:40.040 --> 3:36:43.920]  I'll just ask them that question a moment. That is these two calls. But as I pontificate
[3:36:43.920 --> 3:36:51.200]  here, let's just get to the club itself. Truly relishing and how Fox News, you're like, I'm
[3:36:51.200 --> 3:36:58.360]  a child molester. I'm a murderer. I'm Saddam. What is it we're doing? We're alive. We have
[3:36:58.360 --> 3:37:04.480]  a spirit. We have a soul. We want to live. We want you to live. We're not destructive.
[3:37:04.480 --> 3:37:10.480]  That's what they don't like. Here it is.
[3:37:10.480 --> 3:37:14.920]  He's been taking a lot of heat for interviewing radio show host Alex Jones, but the New York
[3:37:14.920 --> 3:37:18.840]  Times interviewed him recently. He was booked here at one point at the view, but then he
[3:37:18.840 --> 3:37:25.040]  canceled and he's not going to be rescheduled. So it's Megan writes when she says, you know,
[3:37:25.040 --> 3:37:29.840]  you can't just interview the good guys. She wants to expose the garbage. He's viewed by
[3:37:29.840 --> 3:37:35.400]  a guy who has a presence here. Well, you know, the thing about him and, you know, people
[3:37:35.400 --> 3:37:39.120]  have free speech in this country, but no matter how hateful and how stupid, no matter how
[3:37:39.120 --> 3:37:46.480]  we name, give him their time, give him Thorazine also. This guy also went after the families
[3:37:46.480 --> 3:37:52.360]  in Newtown. That was the major show. The clip did, lady, because those kids all died little
[3:37:52.360 --> 3:37:56.680]  six year old kids. Okay, we're talking about the 500,000 Iraqis saying that it was a hoax
[3:37:56.680 --> 3:38:02.720]  that they made it up. And it's such a heinous people that listened to him were harassing
[3:38:02.720 --> 3:38:07.480]  the dead children's parents. Yes. And he has. Oh, I did that too. Where's the privilege?
[3:38:07.480 --> 3:38:11.920]  Number one follower, Donald Trump, the president of the United States. I'm just saying. So,
[3:38:11.920 --> 3:38:17.680]  you know, if the president listens to him, um, I would like to listen to him too. I want
[3:38:17.680 --> 3:38:21.720]  to hear what this idiot has to say so that I can go after him. Yeah. What's the point
[3:38:21.720 --> 3:38:27.120]  of keeping it in the closet? Now, I hope that Megan does that because he deserves to be
[3:38:27.120 --> 3:38:31.240]  vilified and attacked on the air. I'm just not so sure about that. I mean, you know,
[3:38:31.240 --> 3:38:36.560]  Anderson Cooper has spearheaded this no notoriety campaign where he won't say the name of killers.
[3:38:36.560 --> 3:38:43.160]  He won't, it gives exposure that they want. This is a nasty man that has harassed the
[3:38:43.160 --> 3:38:47.760]  parents of dead children. I don't think you give him a platform to more than the six million
[3:38:47.760 --> 3:38:51.840]  people that already follow him. I mean, I think there certainly is a balance to your
[3:38:51.840 --> 3:38:56.720]  point when you want to expose people, but why give him the notoriety that he obviously
[3:38:56.720 --> 3:39:00.640]  crazed. Well, the thing is he already has that. People find him. That's right. That's
[3:39:00.640 --> 3:39:03.800]  enough of them. Shut them up for a second. Look, look, I want to get reports taken. Take
[3:39:03.800 --> 3:39:08.000]  a few calls and get out of here, but listen. I don't know. Notice it's all scripted, whether
[3:39:08.000 --> 3:39:14.840]  it's NBC or the view on ABC or whatever. It's all six million. Like they, like they got,
[3:39:14.840 --> 3:39:19.800]  it's 45 million dumb ass. And the thing is, I love how it's all like, where do these scripts
[3:39:19.800 --> 3:39:24.400]  come from? Cause you see the same and then like deeply racist, just throw that in and
[3:39:24.400 --> 3:39:28.760]  he loves killing kids and he's, you know, he's like killers and you, you, you heard that
[3:39:28.760 --> 3:39:33.160]  Fox News said the same thing, MSNBC and then all these other cowards pile on. Like maybe
[3:39:33.160 --> 3:39:38.080]  they'll get promoted at daily caller. If they write articles saying, you know, that Kane
[3:39:38.080 --> 3:39:44.160]  never called for revolution or his son didn't get arrested. It's like, I'd always thought
[3:39:44.160 --> 3:39:48.800]  I was a nobody. Like just an average man and then I don't feel big at how pathetic they
[3:39:48.800 --> 3:39:53.360]  are. Rappaport. Again, you're, you're more savvy than I don't just say that it's true.
[3:39:53.360 --> 3:39:59.880]  What do you, as our great Oracle take from this?
[3:39:59.880 --> 3:40:09.080]  Fantasy projection is what I saw there. You know, they have some idea called Alex Jones
[3:40:09.080 --> 3:40:18.040]  and they've gotten their cues from other people and they are completely immersed in the, what
[3:40:18.040 --> 3:40:22.960]  they think is the left versus the right. And, you know, all this mental apparatus that they
[3:40:22.960 --> 3:40:29.080]  share and now they have this projected fantasy. Okay, we're, we're told he's evil. Did we
[3:40:29.080 --> 3:40:33.320]  ever listen to him? What he has to say? No, of course not. Don't be silly. We don't have
[3:40:33.320 --> 3:40:38.400]  time for that. All we have time to do is attack. So let's attack. You know, so this is like
[3:40:38.400 --> 3:40:46.280]  a classic case of fantasy projection. I mean, we don't want to talk to him really. We don't
[3:40:46.280 --> 3:40:50.880]  want to give him a platform to say anything. We just want to talk over him. That's our
[3:40:50.880 --> 3:40:52.640]  job. That's what we do. We just,
[3:40:52.640 --> 3:40:55.880]  And that is Bayard made the only true statement then backed off of it. Oh, because he's not
[3:40:55.880 --> 3:40:59.360]  going to be rebooked because he didn't want to be screamed at for no reason. I threw this
[3:40:59.360 --> 3:41:02.960]  on one of the other security reasons. They're not involved in it, but it's much larger folks.
[3:41:02.960 --> 3:41:05.560]  We have the intel. They wanted to get me in New York because we're not going. We're not
[3:41:05.560 --> 3:41:10.000]  playing their game. They can't believe we refused them. She said, we need to hear what
[3:41:10.000 --> 3:41:14.320]  he had to say, but instead they're going to see an edited Megan Kelly four hours down
[3:41:14.320 --> 3:41:19.880]  to 11 minutes. And I've already seen the promo. She aired. That's not what I said, John.
[3:41:19.880 --> 3:41:26.440]  And also look at what they're doing with Megan Kelly. She's now a colleague, right? Because
[3:41:26.440 --> 3:41:33.360]  she's on one of the good networks. So they're trying to save her bacon. They're trying to
[3:41:33.360 --> 3:41:39.880]  keep her, you know, afloat because as soon as she started her show, the ratings started
[3:41:39.880 --> 3:41:45.720]  to go down. Sure. So they want this big controversy to boon her. Yeah, of course, because she's
[3:41:45.720 --> 3:41:49.880]  part of the club now. We have to defend the people in the club. We can't just let them
[3:41:49.880 --> 3:41:56.240]  sink down into the muck. You know, what would it look like if Megan Kelly, after three months
[3:41:56.240 --> 3:42:01.320]  at her new network job was suddenly let go because nothing's happening. Ratings are in
[3:42:01.320 --> 3:42:07.480]  the toilet. No, no, no, we can't let that happen. We, you know, we're all in this together.
[3:42:07.480 --> 3:42:11.440]  So we all indeed, you have to prop each other up even though we're competing. Yeah, the
[3:42:11.440 --> 3:42:15.560]  view couldn't believe that I canceled. I've been on there before. It's just totally idiotic.
[3:42:15.560 --> 3:42:22.400]  I mean, what's the point of going and being screamed at by a bunch of morons? Yeah, I'm
[3:42:22.400 --> 3:42:26.640]  not afraid to do it. I could just only handle so many harpies. Let's go to Ryan. Ryan, you're
[3:42:26.640 --> 3:42:32.800]  at the truck stop. I guess you're fueling up. A lady just hears my voice over your radio.
[3:42:32.800 --> 3:42:37.600]  She runs over screaming. I'm a racist. I guess she heard Tom Brokaw. I mean, did you ask
[3:42:37.600 --> 3:42:43.120]  her what's the proof? How did this end? Yeah, well, basically she got between me and my
[3:42:43.120 --> 3:42:46.360]  truck to where I couldn't even comfortably get out of the way. And I told her she had
[3:42:46.360 --> 3:42:52.120]  a choice. She needs to move back or she can go to jail. And it was this nice Latino fell
[3:42:52.120 --> 3:42:58.480]  actually nearby. He kind of came over asking if we needed any help. And she backed away
[3:42:58.480 --> 3:43:03.800]  real quick after that. And I told her, I said, go to info wars.com and actually read some
[3:43:03.800 --> 3:43:08.640]  of the material before you start hating on people. I said, contrary to popular belief,
[3:43:08.640 --> 3:43:13.640]  Alexander's trying to save humanity, not grown it. And that's kind of how the conversation
[3:43:13.640 --> 3:43:18.440]  ended. And I got to thinking, you know, what is the solution? Well, for people like me
[3:43:18.440 --> 3:43:24.800]  who don't have a big platform like you do, I think everybody needs to, you know, it's
[3:43:24.800 --> 3:43:29.280]  time to take our money and start spending it on patriots such as, you know, yourself
[3:43:29.280 --> 3:43:35.000]  and your program and absolutely refuse to give any money that funnels into these programs.
[3:43:35.000 --> 3:43:41.000]  That's why we got rid of Tom Warner cable. We're not going to fund the money to a corporation
[3:43:41.000 --> 3:43:42.000]  of globalist.
[3:43:42.000 --> 3:43:45.920]  That's right. They had to change the name. We have the economic power. That's why they
[3:43:45.920 --> 3:43:51.680]  want to sew it up North Korea or Venezuela. And by you supporting us, believe me, just
[3:43:51.680 --> 3:43:57.240]  spreading the word about info wars or no more fake news.com. You are that. That's the oxygen.
[3:43:57.240 --> 3:44:01.560]  That's the power. So don't think you're small. You know, what do you do with a small platform?
[3:44:01.560 --> 3:44:09.440]  You, you, the individual are the entire universe just contained in your space. John Rabaport.
[3:44:09.440 --> 3:44:15.080]  Absolutely. I found that to be true. And I'm sure you have an other independent media
[3:44:15.080 --> 3:44:21.160]  have. You start getting communications from people all over the world. How does that happen?
[3:44:21.160 --> 3:44:27.240]  Because people start to say, look at this. Oh yeah. And they say, and they say, and it
[3:44:27.240 --> 3:44:35.160]  just geometrically progresses because people want to know other points of view. They want
[3:44:35.160 --> 3:44:41.680]  to hear other voices. That's what's going on. And the awakening just keeps on spreading
[3:44:41.680 --> 3:44:47.320]  in various ways that nobody can track. And that's another one of their big problems.
[3:44:47.320 --> 3:44:51.400]  They haven't figured out that one yet. They think they have, but they haven't. How do
[3:44:51.400 --> 3:44:56.920]  we, how do we identify the people that are actually waking up? Well, we have this parameter
[3:44:56.920 --> 3:45:01.960]  and that algorithm, but you're not really, you know, it's out of control. It's out of
[3:45:01.960 --> 3:45:08.080]  their control. And their control freaks. So they don't know what to do. Thank you, Ryan.
[3:45:08.080 --> 3:45:13.080]  Steve in Florida, last caller. Go ahead. You're on the air with John Robbaport. Yeah. Hey,
[3:45:13.080 --> 3:45:20.320]  Alex, several things. I want to talk about how the strategy for Trump's succeeding and
[3:45:20.320 --> 3:45:24.200]  countering this attack. But first of all, I want to say this, your guest, you just had
[3:45:24.200 --> 3:45:29.120]  on Craig. He mentioned, I've called before and mentioned this to you. And I know you're
[3:45:29.120 --> 3:45:37.400]  really busy, but you really need to look into Alfred Kinsey. Go to Dr. Dr. Judith Reisman,
[3:45:37.400 --> 3:45:44.480]  M-A-N-R-E-I-S-M-A-N, Dr. Judith Reisman.com and get her excellent three hour documentary,
[3:45:44.480 --> 3:45:48.880]  the Kinsey Syndrome. No, I know, let's get her on. I'm aware of it. Her and also not
[3:45:48.880 --> 3:45:55.120]  just Kinsey, but Skinner. I mean, it was just, it's just, it's unbelievable. Steve, let's
[3:45:55.120 --> 3:46:02.600]  get Robbaport's take on that. Jose Delgado, you know, the Yale experimenter putting electrodes
[3:46:02.600 --> 3:46:08.320]  into people. Now we're really getting into the, into the stuff, the science lab. Here's
[3:46:08.320 --> 3:46:13.680]  how we're going to turn people into machines. That's basically what we're doing. And that's
[3:46:13.680 --> 3:46:20.040]  what all this is. We ask, why are these people like robots? Because they've shown I'm a robot.
[3:46:20.040 --> 3:46:23.520]  And so people up above them do that. So let me ask you this. I'm going to ask Steve this.
[3:46:23.520 --> 3:46:27.600]  And then let me ask you, I'm going to report this. What is above the robotic control? Who's
[3:46:27.600 --> 3:46:31.440]  pulling the strings? Who comes up with something like this? Because I'm not into space aliens.
[3:46:31.440 --> 3:46:39.520]  I don't go there, but you really study this. This isn't human. This doesn't make sense.
[3:46:39.520 --> 3:46:44.320]  Steve. Yeah, here, here's the thing. The one that's behind all this. Here's the thing
[3:46:44.320 --> 3:46:50.400]  out. She talked about in fours being the tip of the spear. If they can cut the tip off,
[3:46:50.400 --> 3:46:55.320]  what good is a spear? The thing that you represent more than anything else is the same thing
[3:46:55.320 --> 3:47:01.680]  with Trump is what they are afraid of the most. And that is the truth. And the thing is, is
[3:47:01.680 --> 3:47:06.520]  that in the Bible, the truth is represented by a sword. So here's what I wanted to say
[3:47:06.520 --> 3:47:10.960]  to you. And we should say it info wars and all the second action are the sort of truth.
[3:47:10.960 --> 3:47:16.200]  You're right. Right. So here's what I want to say. You've been talking about wanting,
[3:47:16.200 --> 3:47:20.680]  you know, Trump to have these fireside chats. It's been in front of you all along. And I'm
[3:47:20.680 --> 3:47:25.560]  not fulking. I'm just giving you a suggestion of how you can do that. Make that happen.
[3:47:25.560 --> 3:47:31.400]  Okay. The New World Order has had two, now he has a two-pronged pincer attack. They're
[3:47:31.400 --> 3:47:37.400]  hitting Trump and Alex Jones because Trump represents the real Washington, the father
[3:47:37.400 --> 3:47:42.840]  of our country. And Alex Jones represents the real media that puts forth the truth.
[3:47:42.840 --> 3:47:49.320]  So here's what I would suggest. Make info wars, Trump's war room. Have this fireside
[3:47:49.320 --> 3:47:54.600]  chat. He's asked you about going on a show. But Trump's smart. He knows how they've demonized
[3:47:54.600 --> 3:47:58.440]  him with info wars. So he's, he's doing his own deal. He needs to do his own fireside chat.
[3:47:58.440 --> 3:48:02.840]  But I hear you, we should go into a war room mode. The audience realize how big a war it is.
[3:48:02.840 --> 3:48:05.880]  Thank you, Steve. Great points. Report. Well, you have the last segment. Thanks for letting
[3:48:05.880 --> 3:48:10.760]  me crash your show as usual. Always love being on you. But I mean, to answer his question or
[3:48:10.760 --> 3:48:16.520]  answer my question, what is above the robotic control they're trying to put on us? Why are they
[3:48:16.520 --> 3:48:23.640]  doing this? I think we covered some of it earlier. It's, it's the dead trying to make everybody else
[3:48:23.640 --> 3:48:31.400]  dead. You know, it's an inevitable pattern. When you have no spirit, no life, no energy of any kind
[3:48:31.400 --> 3:48:37.160]  really left in you, the only thing that's left is control. And what do you want to control? Or
[3:48:37.160 --> 3:48:45.720]  how do you want to control by making everybody like you dead, automatic machines that just
[3:48:45.720 --> 3:48:53.080]  function in their slots, they perform their tasks, and you keep enough of them around to make it look
[3:48:53.080 --> 3:49:00.440]  like the planet is populated. I mean, this is the ultimate technocratic globalist solution.
[3:49:00.440 --> 3:49:05.160]  We want to make people into machines. So it's a spiritual takeover.
[3:49:05.960 --> 3:49:11.400]  Yeah, of course, it's always happening at that level, at the highest level. I mean,
[3:49:11.400 --> 3:49:18.200]  they certainly don't need money. But they do have to keep, they still have the obsession to control.
[3:49:19.160 --> 3:49:26.760]  Because if they don't, freedom might break out. And that would be, you know, that's like holding
[3:49:26.760 --> 3:49:31.720]  a silver cross up to a vampire or shooting a vampire with a silver bullet. They see freedom
[3:49:31.720 --> 3:49:39.800]  breaking out. They go insane. They feel like it's the end of their existence. I've had experiences
[3:49:39.800 --> 3:49:45.880]  with people like that. There is no question about it in my mind. That's how they feel.
[3:49:47.000 --> 3:49:55.640]  My existence could come to an end just by seeing something that's free and alive.
[3:49:57.000 --> 3:50:01.880]  We have to kill it. Because they're living in artificial facsimiles, not in the real universe.
[3:50:01.880 --> 3:50:06.760]  Exactly. That's what they've come to. That's why they always want to create little artificial
[3:50:06.760 --> 3:50:14.120]  universes and then force us into them. Right. And make us fit into those slots so that
[3:50:14.120 --> 3:50:21.080]  nothing is alive anymore. It's all machine. I look at so many so-called successful people.
[3:50:21.080 --> 3:50:26.040]  They revel in going along with the system as if they're playing the game and winning,
[3:50:26.040 --> 3:50:30.440]  even though that system is destroying them and their own children. Wow. All right, Mr.

[3:54:07.800 --> 3:54:12.360]  John Rapp, we're here in the last segment sitting in for Alex on info wars.
[3:54:12.360 --> 3:54:21.160]  I think we covered a fair amount of territory over the last hour. It's called life against death.
[3:54:22.200 --> 3:54:32.680]  Okay, really life against death. I've been a reporter now for about 35 years going back all
[3:54:32.680 --> 3:54:42.120]  the way in 1982. What have I seen out there as in the mainstream because I've talked to reporters and
[3:54:42.120 --> 3:54:54.680]  so on and so forth? Death. Pretty much death. What kind of death? Spiritual death mainly.
[3:54:54.680 --> 3:55:00.760]  I mean that's the ultimate form. I've got to cover this and I've got to cover it in a certain way
[3:55:00.760 --> 3:55:10.680]  and I know that and everybody else knows that but nevertheless I'm going to do what I'm told to do
[3:55:10.680 --> 3:55:15.880]  and I'm going to pretend that I believe in it and these are my principles and it all has to do
[3:55:15.880 --> 3:55:20.440]  with who the bosses of the bosses are that are telling me what to do but I don't want to think
[3:55:20.440 --> 3:55:26.520]  about that because then I would become a slave, a robot in my own mind so I have to pretend that
[3:55:26.520 --> 3:55:32.040]  I'm always advancing, I'm always progressing, I'm getting better jobs, better positions as a
[3:55:32.040 --> 3:55:37.000]  reporter within the mainstream and everything is working out and you get there and you get
[3:55:37.000 --> 3:55:41.160]  there and you get there and then you get to a big position. How do you like your new position?
[3:55:41.160 --> 3:55:52.760]  Well it's, you know, it's death. It's death. Now you are the prime robot in the prime position
[3:55:52.760 --> 3:56:00.760]  telling the prime cut lies. That's what's happening. That is what's happening to you.
[3:56:01.320 --> 3:56:07.000]  That is what's happening to the people around you and so on and so forth all the time every day.
[3:56:08.920 --> 3:56:13.880]  So when somebody else comes along, as Alex and I were talking about, who's in independent media,
[3:56:14.520 --> 3:56:22.120]  what does that mean? I say what's on my mind, not what somebody else tells me to say.
[3:56:22.120 --> 3:56:28.840]  Ooh, what a revolutionary concept that is. And I research on my own to discover what the truth is.
[3:56:28.840 --> 3:56:35.160]  Oh, that's true. We can't do that. No, of course not. And then I put it out there.
[3:56:37.800 --> 3:56:42.200]  In the biggest possible terms, going as deep as possible down to the core
[3:56:42.200 --> 3:56:50.280]  and talking about issues like freedom, the individual, individual power,
[3:56:53.560 --> 3:57:00.200]  the struggles of centuries to liberate humanity from kings and monarchs who said they had the
[3:57:00.200 --> 3:57:05.880]  divine right to rule and all manner of different forms of slavery, etc, etc, etc.
[3:57:05.880 --> 3:57:14.040]  Well, that's an enviable position to be in when you really think about it,
[3:57:15.160 --> 3:57:20.040]  to be able to do that. Everybody can do that in their own way.
[3:57:21.240 --> 3:57:30.760]  You're your own person is another way of saying it. You're your own person. What future do you want to see?
[3:57:30.760 --> 3:57:41.000]  What future are you willing to strive for and work for? That's not robot future,
[3:57:41.800 --> 3:57:47.320]  death future, no life energy future, but is alive.
[3:57:50.120 --> 3:57:57.480]  Creative. What future are you willing to put all your energy behind?
[3:57:57.480 --> 3:58:00.040]  You're your own person.
[3:58:02.680 --> 3:58:09.720]  The titans of news who deliver the false picture of reality are working for death.
[3:58:09.720 --> 3:58:37.560]  See you next time, folks.
