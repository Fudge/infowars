[00:00.000 --> 00:14.160]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.160 --> 00:33.840]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones they say that when
[00:33.840 --> 00:39.980]  you slow down and really think about nothing that you clear your mind and really can see
[00:39.980 --> 00:44.560]  the world clearly for what it is and I was able to do that yesterday one of my friends
[00:44.560 --> 00:54.760]  has a boat on Lake Austin and so I took my children out on the lake with his children
[00:54.760 --> 01:02.440]  and we ran into Rob Lowe's younger brother one of the stars of true blood that was weird
[01:02.440 --> 01:08.600]  but other than that I there was almost no one on the lake which is very rare it's really
[01:08.600 --> 01:12.940]  the dammed up Colorado River they just call it Lake Austin now it's Ladybird Lake they
[01:12.940 --> 01:17.340]  changed the name over a few years why not it's really a river and lie and call the lake
[01:17.340 --> 01:23.220]  why not tell more lies the point is we're out on the Colorado River wheels within wheels
[01:23.220 --> 01:33.340]  and I've watched we're out there about four or five hours and probably saw five boats
[01:33.340 --> 01:38.560]  it was deader than when I was a kid when come down here and visit my grandparents in my
[01:38.560 --> 01:44.240]  dad would say let's drive out to Lake Austin that was hillbillies then back in the 80s
[01:44.240 --> 01:49.440]  nobody out there maybe a few fishing shacks and a few mansions on the hill and you would
[01:49.440 --> 01:54.600]  see more boats when I was a little kid on Lake Austin that I saw out there yesterday
[01:54.600 --> 02:08.280]  it was the perfect day dead and I watched the police drive around and pull over every single
[02:08.280 --> 02:14.000]  boat on the lake and people kayaking they would stop them and have their lights on and
[02:14.000 --> 02:18.440]  do something so then they got behind us and I got up with my iPhone started filming it
[02:18.440 --> 02:22.960]  because they were bugging their eyes out you know with a predatory bearing until they drive
[02:22.960 --> 02:26.680]  right up by the boat and looked at me in the face and then look sheepishly and waved and
[02:26.680 --> 02:31.440]  drove off and I don't know if they recognize me or what because I was wearing a fedora
[02:31.440 --> 02:36.960]  and with a son a straw fedora they probably weren't it was that I wasn't going to just
[02:36.960 --> 02:42.400]  sit there and roll around the bottom of the boat begging them that oh I'm a criminal please
[02:42.400 --> 02:50.280]  please don't get me and again I'm not anti police but every day I see videos where they
[02:50.280 --> 02:56.120]  arrest someone filming them even 100 yards away not interfering with them or I see video
[02:56.120 --> 03:00.560]  where the cops and the woman's face as she kisses his nose and they slam her to the ground
[03:00.560 --> 03:08.040]  and then arrest her and then charge her with assaulting them I saw an article yesterday
[03:08.040 --> 03:14.640]  in the video in another case where they knocked the woman's windows out because she bought
[03:14.640 --> 03:21.720]  LaCroix water I drink LaCroix water really good canned water and I I know cans aren't
[03:21.720 --> 03:25.960]  good for you but I still if I see it sometimes I drink it because it's such LaCroix LaCroix
[03:25.960 --> 03:32.920]  how do you pronounce it she's going to a charity event for people with disabilities they've
[03:32.920 --> 03:40.840]  got cookie dough and they've also got LaCroix water and she gets in her car closes the door
[03:40.840 --> 03:52.000]  they run up screaming with guns unmarked tell her get out well first I told her roll down
[03:52.000 --> 03:55.920]  the window so she goes around the window they go she has to start the car they go no don't
[03:55.920 --> 04:01.120]  roll down your window and then they tell her stable she's at and then they knock the windows
[04:01.120 --> 04:07.800]  out and then charge her with assaulting them she never touched them and it's it's it's
[04:07.800 --> 04:13.360]  militarized police is what it is most of them are vets of occupied zones where they'll just
[04:13.360 --> 04:16.920]  shoot up whole vehicles of somebody looks at them wrong on record and they're coming
[04:16.920 --> 04:21.480]  back and they're not peace officers they are paramilitary police they'll admit this and
[04:21.480 --> 04:26.520]  we are an occupied country and this is how we're treated and the more slaves they can
[04:26.520 --> 04:34.240]  bag the better and it's really crazy as I saw this footage of this guy filming police
[04:34.240 --> 04:41.520]  looks like she's about 60 70 yards away broad daylight they come over put him in handcuffs
[04:41.520 --> 04:47.400]  looks like one of them punches him in the face the guy's dog jumps out of his vehicle
[04:47.400 --> 04:52.600]  and they shoot the dog and then they charge the guy with a bunch of stuff I mean this
[04:52.600 --> 04:56.800]  is this is how they take you to the FEMA camp now folks we have the biggest prison population

[09:05.000 --> 09:09.600]  he could come on and talk about his experiences as a mission controller on the front line
[09:09.600 --> 09:15.640]  of the Apollo missions and he did talk to us a little bit about the NSA and said that
[09:15.640 --> 09:19.040]  I could you know talk about some of it that wasn't classified but then he called us the
[09:19.040 --> 09:23.000]  other day and said hey will you please stop talking about that so we'll we'll see what
[09:23.000 --> 09:32.160]  Raymond is able to talk about coming on the broadcast hearing about 25 minutes from now
[09:32.160 --> 09:38.320]  and then Professor Griff of course one of the founders of Public Enemy who's here in
[09:38.320 --> 09:45.160]  town with LL Cool J and Ice Cube he is scheduled he's driving down from Dallas right now with

[10:12.520 --> 10:16.440]  Team who's always pro second amendment goes hey when the government turns theirs in I'll
[10:16.440 --> 10:22.680]  turn mine in and hey peers you got bodyguards you want them to turn their guns in okay so
[10:22.680 --> 10:26.280]  when you turn yours in I'll turn mine in how's that sound just real that's what Jesse Ventura
[10:26.280 --> 10:31.480]  says that's what I say the only people that want our guns are gangster government and
[10:31.480 --> 10:37.280]  the mark of whether somebody's a good guy or a bad guy where you start is are they pro
[10:37.280 --> 10:46.680]  self defense it's very very simple so that's some of the issues that we're gonna be raising
[10:46.680 --> 10:53.640]  and going over in the meantime at the start of the next hour as I've got Raymond coming
[10:53.640 --> 10:59.760]  up another news I'm gonna get to now I'm gonna break down foreign troops in America and
[10:59.760 --> 11:05.320]  Paul Watson did a story on this yesterday morning that ended up being the top story
[11:05.320 --> 11:15.880]  on DrudgeReport.com and so it was covered by Michael Savage, Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity
[11:15.880 --> 11:19.680]  and I didn't hear of Becky Poo covered it but we were sent clips by their listeners
[11:19.680 --> 11:23.720]  that people we don't really listen we're too busy doing our own news research but people
[11:23.720 --> 11:27.760]  sent us the clips I listened to the Savage clip and he had the best analysis of it compared
[11:27.760 --> 11:33.280]  to the others but the point is and that that clips up on info wars.com the point is I want
[11:33.280 --> 11:40.240]  to explain something to people the old timers of the John Virch society in the 50s and 60s
[11:40.240 --> 11:46.640]  and the old timers who they called extremist crazies were constantly saying there's a plan
[11:46.640 --> 11:51.800]  to put foreign troops in America there's a plan to get rid of our borders there's a
[11:51.800 --> 11:57.960]  plan to put you in 200 square foot homes there's a plan to break up families there's a plan
[11:57.960 --> 12:06.400]  to take our guns there's a plan for forced inoculation now 60 years later all of this
[12:06.400 --> 12:18.480]  is being phased in or has been phased in remember all the people like G. Ebert Griffin 45 years
[12:18.480 --> 12:24.400]  ago and Red Beckman 50 years ago and it's weird to get an old folks I was doing this
[12:24.400 --> 12:34.200]  20 years ago on air 18 years ago we were always going off source documents but then people
[12:34.200 --> 12:39.440]  heard about it and then oh it just became a rumor we were going off congressional hearings
[12:39.440 --> 12:45.400]  council on foreign relations publications club of Rome publications you in statements
[12:45.400 --> 12:52.360]  Rockefeller statements and that's what's so frustrating about this and we said they're
[12:52.360 --> 12:56.800]  going to implode the world economy bail out the governments with fiat currency shining
[12:56.800 --> 13:02.640]  us on to their fake derivatives debts I've been saying this for 1415 years because it
[13:02.640 --> 13:06.240]  was the plan when they got rid of Glass-Steagall I had the economist on to break it down like
[13:06.240 --> 13:13.640]  George Humphrey the issue I'm getting at here is that we've known exactly what's going
[13:13.640 --> 13:20.160]  to happen because they all wrote about it like the White House science are in 1974 the
[13:20.160 --> 13:26.960]  year I was born he's now the White House science are wrote it with the former science are of
[13:26.960 --> 13:35.320]  Bush senior John P. Holdren saying we're going to put stuff in your water to sterilize your
[13:35.320 --> 13:39.320]  butt incrementally but not everybody because we don't want it to be causal or you can find
[13:39.320 --> 13:45.200]  one thing that's doing it it's going to be an aggregate cocktail effect and then all
[13:45.200 --> 13:49.640]  the other books Bertrand Russell and the rest of them wrote about spiking our water spiking
[13:49.640 --> 13:55.160]  our food reducing fertility how they get rid of the family how they do it first by encouraging
[13:55.160 --> 14:02.120]  homosexuality so that there was no definition of man and woman now in the US and Europe
[14:02.120 --> 14:06.160]  they've banned the word husband and wife on government forms because husband and wife
[14:06.160 --> 14:11.880]  is hurtful to people that don't have a husband or wife we're already there and so it's it's
[14:11.880 --> 14:18.120]  way past them turning it into some fake civil liberty about oh you don't like gay people
[14:18.120 --> 14:23.160]  it has nothing to do with that it I mean if a frog isn't able to reproduce because it's
[14:23.160 --> 14:30.120]  had chemicals put in the water is that about gay or heterosexual if more and more fish
[14:30.120 --> 14:34.240]  are hermaphroditic I mean is that because I'm homophobic I'm reporting that this is
[14:34.240 --> 14:38.360]  the mindlessness of where you know they had that teapot I never really even talked about
[14:38.360 --> 14:43.520]  it that was simply a teapot with a handle look nothing like Hitler it's like looking
[14:43.520 --> 14:48.160]  in a cloud and saying it looks like a dinosaur if a cloud looked like Hitler to somebody
[14:48.160 --> 14:51.880]  we have to send up you know the Air Force to spray it with chemicals to dissipate it
[14:51.880 --> 14:57.080]  because it's racist all the real tyrannies going on we're giving 85 billion a month of
[14:57.080 --> 15:04.440]  taxpayer money to foreign banks to bankrupt this cancer rates are exploding all this horrible
[15:04.440 --> 15:11.600]  tyrannies taking place we're all losing our rights to habeas corpus to possecom and taught
[15:11.600 --> 15:17.120]  us all the basic liberties are being eroded destroyed demolished and people are going
[15:17.120 --> 15:25.680]  into JC penny and seeing a good looking teapot with a curve in an area for your handle and
[15:25.680 --> 15:34.040]  a round handle on the top that someone imagine looks like Adolf Hitler and now a girl's
[15:34.040 --> 15:38.080]  eating a pastry and it looks like the shape of a gun after she took bites out of it they've
[15:38.080 --> 15:42.360]  kicked kids out for bringing a gun gun cookie you know they're making cookies with moms
[15:42.360 --> 15:48.920]  the boy makes one like a gun I did that when I was a kid no no no now you're kicked out
[15:48.920 --> 15:55.200]  of school if you're sitting there eating it you're sitting there you're sitting there
[15:55.200 --> 16:03.920]  eating it and you lay down the pastry and someone goes a gun and then they want to add
[16:03.920 --> 16:13.200]  into this mind control hysteria you're then kicked out of school or you wear an NRA shirt
[16:13.200 --> 16:18.280]  with an R in our ACL saying defend our rights and you're kicked out and then the cops tell
[16:18.280 --> 16:21.920]  you to take the shirt off you go there's no rule without you know for wearing political
[16:21.920 --> 16:27.360]  shirts in school I'm not going to take it off so they then charge you with that when
[16:27.360 --> 16:32.880]  it's an unlawful order the cops can't show up at your house say mow your yard they can't
[16:32.880 --> 16:39.800]  show up at your house and say come out here and comb my hair and you laugh in most third
[16:39.800 --> 16:44.480]  world countries and most Soviet style countries they make you a few days a week go do compulsory
[16:44.480 --> 16:50.480]  volunteerism and another Orwellian oxymoron and do this so at the start of the next hour
[16:50.480 --> 16:54.760]  I'm going to get into our article it's now on the right hand side of Drudge it's in top
[16:54.760 --> 17:00.880]  story archive of info wars dot com just click on that link Russian forces to provide security
[17:00.880 --> 17:09.280]  at U.S. events ladies and gentlemen in NLE09 they had tabletop 15 nations here with military
[17:09.280 --> 17:17.120]  representatives doing drills on tabletops of how they'd help take over U.S. cities quote
[17:17.120 --> 17:23.720]  during natural disasters or civil emergencies and the documents have been in the Washington
[17:23.720 --> 17:28.640]  Post but like it's a good thing that oh we're going to have Mexican and Canadian troops on
[17:28.640 --> 17:33.440]  the streets of America during any emergency or to deal with civil unrest or insurrection
[17:33.440 --> 17:38.600]  and then Canada and Mexico reciprocate where we go down there and then you saw the Olympics
[17:38.600 --> 17:43.320]  a few years ago the winter Olympics it was in all the big papers U.S. troops weren't
[17:43.320 --> 17:48.600]  just in the one city where they had the event what was it Calgary if I go from memory it
[17:48.600 --> 17:53.440]  was in the paper but like it was good U.S. troops patrol the bar district and they were
[17:53.440 --> 18:00.440]  all over multi cities helping run checkpoints you don't just get royal mounted police running
[18:00.440 --> 18:06.560]  warrantless checkpoints in Canada you get U.S. Army and U.S. Marines that were just
[18:06.560 --> 18:15.040]  in Fallujah a few years before and you have from from Tennessee to California mainstream
[18:15.040 --> 18:21.200]  news articles where the the Marines and Army set up checkpoints with nine millimeters on
[18:21.200 --> 18:26.040]  their hips and with heavy machine guns in the backs of Humvees and search vehicles at
[18:26.040 --> 18:32.920]  highway checkpoints it's illegal to have the cops do that but they just do it under the
[18:32.920 --> 18:40.320]  civil emergency under the PDD 51 and Obama has expanded those so so now if they can get
[18:40.320 --> 18:45.120]  away with Russians at NORAD and Russians and anti-terror drills they had last year and
[18:45.120 --> 18:51.040]  by the way we publish this stuff with Pentagon press releases and FEMA press releases and
[18:51.040 --> 18:56.240]  last year no one would cover it because it was too unbelievable people were saying we
[18:56.240 --> 19:01.440]  were making it up until folks in the comments would go wait a minute this is on the Pentagon

[23:38.080 --> 23:44.200]  secret reason why Obama is after your guns and ammo and it's not just in response to
[23:44.200 --> 23:50.600]  mass murders of preparing for war it's something much darker go watch the video now at one
[23:50.600 --> 23:57.160]  two three conspiracy dot com before they shut it down again that's one two three conspiracy
[23:57.160 --> 24:07.720]  dot com the genesis communications radio network proudly presents the alex jones show
[24:07.720 --> 24:28.080]  because there's a war on for your mind by the way president obama told young africans
[24:28.080 --> 24:34.720]  this video is now breaking via cns news that you shouldn't be able to have air conditioning
[24:34.720 --> 24:41.600]  big houses and cars no you've just got to have air force one and have over three thousand
[24:41.600 --> 24:47.040]  aircraft for military brass and congress to fly around on an air force to that cost hundreds
[24:47.040 --> 24:52.960]  of millions a year to run and one night per hotel for obama and his entourage is a million
[24:52.960 --> 24:58.240]  dollars conservatively on average they get three four five six and even ten thousand
[24:58.240 --> 25:02.920]  dollar a night hotel rooms I guarantee you if I was the president I wouldn't be doing
[25:02.920 --> 25:07.560]  things like this but again Michelle Obama is out in the news saying that she feels like
[25:07.560 --> 25:13.120]  she lives in a really nice prison well yeah because they spent two billion dollars putting
[25:13.120 --> 25:21.280]  this puppet in there he's owned by the globalist and so he's an important teleprompter reader
[25:21.280 --> 25:25.400]  so of course they're going to put you in a gilded cage but it's more than that it's
[25:25.400 --> 25:30.600]  about having all the pomp and circumstance and red carpets so that people actually believe
[25:30.600 --> 25:38.080]  the buck stops with El Presidente but just as Maurice Strong swore the head of the United
[25:38.080 --> 25:42.540]  Nations UNESCO program at the time in Rio de Janeiro twenty years ago that they would
[25:42.540 --> 25:49.120]  create a post industrial world a hunger games world where the elite live in fabulous high
[25:49.120 --> 25:53.320]  tech splendor with live extension technologies and you live at starvation level and when
[25:53.320 --> 25:57.840]  you go above certain calorie level you're sent off to be killed that's what they're proposing
[25:57.840 --> 26:04.040]  that's Logan's run that's eugenics they're now calling for calorie taxes across the board
[26:04.040 --> 26:08.400]  here in the US after beta testing you got to have a smart card that tracks everywhere
[26:08.400 --> 26:16.080]  you go with the new VAT slash sales tax system this is the plan one hundred trillion a year
[26:16.080 --> 26:23.120]  in carbon calorie taxes taxing everything from your food to water to transportation
[26:23.120 --> 26:31.160]  paid to private banks watch the Obama deception part one five years old and everything I said
[26:31.160 --> 26:34.680]  Obama did I said he'll it came out right when he was elected I said he'll break all his
[26:34.680 --> 26:40.600]  promises and he'll do a through Z and exactly what I told you he did because I've got their
[26:40.600 --> 26:46.520]  playbook it's like I'm the new England Patriots and I stole the playbook of the Steelers man
[26:46.520 --> 26:53.720]  I know what they're going to do this is not my opinion Obama's Africa trip will cost one
[26:53.720 --> 27:01.560]  hundred million dollars one hundred million dollars and again the global mega banks the
[27:01.560 --> 27:08.320]  global mega rich they have given over a hundred thousand different people last time I checked
[27:08.320 --> 27:14.000]  total diplomatic community their friends their families you name it just from the UN now they're
[27:14.000 --> 27:18.760]  getting diplomatic immunity for big banks that are part of the carbon trading scandal
[27:18.760 --> 27:23.920]  above the law they pay none of this they do none of this they can do whatever they want
[27:23.920 --> 27:30.800]  it's taxes on you to them to say that are exhaling our carbon dioxide's hurting the earth let's
[27:30.800 --> 27:36.440]  go to a clip of Obama telling people that live some of the poorest in the world some
[27:36.440 --> 27:41.360]  of the most wealthy in Africa and in South Africa but still in the top you know percent
[27:41.360 --> 27:46.880]  of poorest people you're just in the lowest percent telling them it's bad for you to have
[27:46.880 --> 27:52.120]  anything nice because you're going to burn the earth up when carbon dioxide has nothing
[27:52.120 --> 27:57.400]  to do with that and it's been a proven hoax and a fraud is Obama worried about genetic
[27:57.400 --> 28:01.400]  engineering open air is he worried about all the toxic waste dumping is he worried you
[28:01.400 --> 28:08.360]  ever hear about any of the real threats thousands of different crops with live pharmacological
[28:08.360 --> 28:13.280]  viruses and things being created they have crops that grow the vaccines that grow the
[28:13.280 --> 28:19.440]  medicines that grow the age virus look it up look up corn crops that grow AIDS vaccine
[28:19.440 --> 28:25.840]  and then it's an AIDS virus in it it's twilight zone but none of that's a threat crossing
[28:25.840 --> 28:32.720]  humans with animals to then grow organs and animals for humans all of this happening brain
[28:32.720 --> 28:41.880]  transplants all of it with mutagenic properties and we ladies and gentlemen are not supposed
[28:41.880 --> 28:47.360]  to talk about it and there it is mutated GM mays on the loose maybe carrying AIDS virus
[28:47.360 --> 28:53.000]  there you go Aaron Dykes wrote about that last year let's go to this clip of Obama the
[28:53.000 --> 28:57.520]  the guy exempt from everything above the law telling you that you shouldn't be able to
[28:57.520 --> 29:02.280]  have a car here it is the youth that everybody's mentioned here in Africa if everybody's
[29:02.280 --> 29:06.920]  raising living standards to the point where everybody's got a car and everybody's got
[29:06.920 --> 29:13.920]  air conditioning everybody's got a big house well the planet will boil over unless we
[29:13.920 --> 29:19.720]  find new ways of producing energy and and and what that means is they are transferring
[29:19.720 --> 29:25.040]  it now now then he says oh new energy sounds great then you just give it to insider buddies
[29:25.040 --> 29:30.640]  who never even get an office space never build any of it while they block all the real new
[29:30.640 --> 29:35.960]  energy systems that have been developed they're just cutting off the resources as a total
[29:35.960 --> 29:40.360]  act of domination and selling the idea that progress is bad and that we've got to have
[29:40.360 --> 29:47.360]  austerity unbelievable control of energy is control of everything the power to tax is

[33:50.800 --> 33:56.000]  seventies put out the club of room documents council on farm relations documents i covered
[33:56.000 --> 34:01.080]  all of my film what is the end game dot com is the bibliography of that film now seven
[34:01.080 --> 34:06.680]  years old where i show how they were going to establish a post industrial world on calories
[34:06.680 --> 34:12.120]  and energy consumption and that they would produce the fear stimulus to create a guilt
[34:12.120 --> 34:17.560]  complex and they said do we say it's an ice age or do we say it's because it's too hot
[34:17.560 --> 34:22.240]  or that we're going to lose our atmosphere and they looked at all of these and they decided
[34:22.240 --> 34:27.840]  and you can go to the any library and pull up the club of rum quarterlies nineteen sixty
[34:27.840 --> 34:33.760]  two you name it i have screenshots of this and they settled on whatever the warming trend

[35:21.200 --> 35:26.120]  they would say yes i agree it's my fault they could kill whoever they wanted every culture

[37:51.960 --> 37:58.440]  but but right at double 195 percent of the taxes were paying a hundred percent they
[37:58.440 --> 38:03.040]  be paying a hundred ninety five percent of what we were paying and lord mongton wrote
[38:03.040 --> 38:06.760]  down the numbers he's the guy that got the document and got absolutely no credit for
[38:06.760 --> 38:10.520]  it that's my point you know we broke that they're sharing all the nsa data with europe
[38:10.520 --> 38:13.600]  and they're spying on us and we're spying on them and the government's let each other
[38:13.600 --> 38:18.680]  do that to create plausible deniability and now that's big news today like we break major
[38:18.680 --> 38:22.600]  news here every day ladies and gentlemen but the enemy media is not going to give us credit
[38:22.600 --> 38:27.720]  so people realize the prestige and i don't need the prestige for myself you need to know
[38:27.720 --> 38:32.040]  the prestige of the liberty movement you need to know that we're winning and we're the real
[38:32.040 --> 38:37.540]  media and maybe we should give it give our say you have events and give each other awards
[38:37.540 --> 38:41.240]  and stuff because i guess that means something it's like napoleon said men will give their
[38:41.240 --> 38:47.240]  lives away for little pieces of metal and ribbon and and we're the opposite of that surface
[38:47.240 --> 38:51.880]  oriented propaganda world but at the same time i don't think we all realize the effect
[38:51.880 --> 38:59.800]  we're having that it came out and we push it on this show we got demonized and some
[38:59.800 --> 39:03.080]  of the press for actually helping push it out over the edge remember i popped champagne
[39:03.080 --> 39:07.520]  on the air when that document came out and then the documents came out of them meeting
[39:07.520 --> 39:12.200]  and secret at the un about how a lot of the public that was a death star blowing up level
[39:12.200 --> 39:19.240]  event i mean that really crippled the enemy that was devastating victory i mean i literally
[39:19.240 --> 39:24.360]  almost rolled around the ground in pleasure it'd be like a Rothschild's you know being
[39:24.360 --> 39:28.280]  you know caught in some huge crime and actually going to jail it'd be like the rocker fellers
[39:28.280 --> 39:34.480]  uh it'd be like uh the police locally doing the right thing and busting a cia white slavery
[39:34.480 --> 39:40.960]  kidnapping aircraft on the tarmac and you know uh it all coming out on the news i mean
[39:40.960 --> 39:47.640]  it's death star level blowing up event okay i mean you want to run around for two weeks
[39:47.640 --> 39:53.760]  and have a celebration that was it things like that are gigantor victories it's a gigantor
[39:53.760 --> 39:57.800]  victory that we forced two billion bullets out in the open armored vehicles and the fact
[39:57.800 --> 40:02.520]  that the government is predatory arming against us in all their manuals so people realize wait
[40:02.520 --> 40:06.960]  we have a predatory government why is it setting up homeland security for us while running al-qaeda
[40:06.960 --> 40:12.800]  the fact that that's all out in the news is a giant devastating victory the fact that
[40:12.800 --> 40:19.680]  russian troops have already been deployed here for decades is a huge victory that we're
[40:19.680 --> 40:24.640]  now exposing that the fact that the things that that they tried to suppress for decades
[40:24.640 --> 40:34.880]  have now been rammed out in the open is a devastating victory against tyranny
[40:34.880 --> 40:41.760]  and so now you go to whole foods you go anywhere where people have the right idea to eat organic
[40:41.760 --> 40:46.760]  to try to be healthy but then they piggyback the tyranny on top every other magazine austerity
[40:46.760 --> 40:53.160]  how great it is to be poor how bad you know carbon is blah blah blah ignoring all the
[40:53.160 --> 40:58.880]  real crises and setting the globalist Goldman Sachs is the number one funder of carbon taxes
[40:58.880 --> 41:03.560]  worldwide the number one funder of all these fake green initiatives go look it up because
[41:03.560 --> 41:07.680]  they're the ones that run the carbon trading systems for all the major exchanges from the
[41:07.680 --> 41:12.120]  chicago mercantile look at who funds the Bilderberg committee that's now being exposed in in the
[41:12.120 --> 41:19.120]  british parliament as being it appears illegal in the lobbying laws the two funders the only
[41:19.120 --> 41:27.960]  two donors to the Bilderberg charity are Goldman Sachs and British Petroleum Goldman Sachs British
[41:27.960 --> 41:33.720]  Petroleum the Queen of England is the majority owner of British Petroleum look it up and
[41:33.720 --> 41:40.680]  then Goldman Sachs is a Rockefeller Rothschild arm go look at who founded every union organization
[41:40.680 --> 41:44.440]  more than 50 of them it's David Rockefeller he's been given awards there where they brag
[41:44.440 --> 41:50.680]  about it his family who gave them the land this is a corporate robber baron global corporate
[41:50.680 --> 42:01.720]  government get out of jail free card system where they get to be above the law un personnel
[42:01.720 --> 42:06.960]  can be caught shipping drugs in their let go they can be caught with slaves all the time
[42:06.960 --> 42:12.240]  in their apartment sex slaves they get let go because they're above the law folks but
[42:12.240 --> 42:16.840]  it's not just them it's this whole corporate anti free market class and now they come and
[42:16.840 --> 42:24.360]  say africa you can't have nice cars you can't have a nice house you can't have air conditioning
[42:24.360 --> 42:30.080]  because we're going to burn the earth up when we have the lowest level of carbon dioxide
[42:30.080 --> 42:35.400]  ever recorded right now it's very low let's go ahead and play a clip again this is so
[42:35.400 --> 42:41.680]  bombshell of obama saying unless we develop clean energies which again they don't let
[42:41.680 --> 42:46.680]  the real clean energies come out they suppress those on record and have windmill farms often
[42:46.680 --> 42:52.600]  won't fun totally clean natural gas has shut down all its power plants it owned so g e plants
[42:52.600 --> 42:58.200]  make more money we gotta buy money pay money for a Mexican power plants that are totally
[42:58.200 --> 43:03.640]  dirty right over the border all because Goldman Sachs and others came in and finance the city
[43:03.640 --> 43:08.440]  council people and general electric came in and so Austinites paid double what we paid
[43:08.440 --> 43:13.320]  five years ago I heard him talking about on local radio this morning just incredible crimes
[43:13.320 --> 43:24.240]  being committed out in front of everybody we have Raymond here okay I just saw people
[43:24.240 --> 43:27.360]  walking around in control room so I thought maybe that was the case let's go ahead and
[43:27.360 --> 43:32.480]  play this clip right now here it is the youth that everybody's mentioned here in Africa
[43:32.480 --> 43:37.160]  if everybody's raising living standards to the point where everybody's got a car and
[43:37.160 --> 43:42.720]  everybody's got air conditioning everybody's got a big house well the planet will boil
[43:42.720 --> 43:52.720]  over oh yeah unless we find new ways of producing energy translation if you the American people
[43:52.720 --> 43:57.400]  people the world don't pay mega banks 100 trillion will you guys put in a devos calls
[43:57.400 --> 44:03.320]  for 100 trillion in capital and then it says it's a tax to private banks 100 trillion in
[44:03.320 --> 44:07.800]  the next decade and they're they're going ahead with it all Obama signed on the carbon
[44:07.800 --> 44:14.440]  taxes last month even though Congress shot it down three years ago he just signed an order
[44:14.440 --> 44:20.600]  and the companies will pay it and pass it on to you I mean this is such a big deal folks
[44:20.600 --> 44:25.320]  this is such a big deal what about the right to not have foreign banks rip me off and shut
[44:25.320 --> 44:34.720]  down community paid for utilities that Austinites paid for over the last 70 years they'd upgrade
[44:34.720 --> 44:40.120]  them they built new plants on the sites they shut them down there it is over 100 trillion
[44:40.120 --> 44:45.720]  additional credit needed to support global growth from the world economic forum and they
[44:45.720 --> 44:50.160]  call it credit they mean taxes because the way central banking works is for a dollar
[44:50.160 --> 45:00.040]  or a euro or a yen or a yawn or a shilling to be created a dollar of debts created that
[45:00.040 --> 45:05.040]  we owe to them man and they can't even take over the world like that they've got to be
[45:05.040 --> 45:09.160]  able to selectively shut down all their competition and you don't hear this on the money shows
[45:09.160 --> 45:13.920]  on the yuppie shows you won't hear this on Republican shows because either they don't
[45:13.920 --> 45:17.240]  understand it or they're bought and paid for ladies and gentlemen I mean this is so easy
[45:17.240 --> 45:23.760]  to understand let me get into the other news now ladies and gentlemen and again after Raymond
[45:23.760 --> 45:28.760]  leaves us sometime the next hour I will cover Russian forces to provide security at US events
[45:28.760 --> 45:35.520]  what's behind that I'm gonna have the next issue of the magazine the August issue I'm
[45:35.520 --> 45:39.480]  gonna have that I'm gonna write articles with all the facts because no one seems to get
[45:39.480 --> 45:46.080]  the big picture that's hiding in 100% plain view sitting on top of us I mean it's all
[45:46.080 --> 45:52.000]  public the plan to occupy the US with foreign troops and every other country don't you understand
[45:52.000 --> 45:57.920]  they're just acclimating I've had foreign troops walk up on tape and tell me turn my
[45:57.920 --> 46:05.240]  camera off in America I made films 13 14 years ago showing you troops training and saying
[46:05.240 --> 46:15.400]  they're training to take on Americans do you not understand that in all the video games
[46:15.400 --> 46:22.920]  and all the movies and the ROCT ROCT training it's always fighting gun owning right wing
[46:22.920 --> 46:27.640]  militias and it's very racist it's always fighting white people in the manuals that
[46:27.640 --> 46:32.480]  white males are the enemy they don't want a new world order used to it was we believe
[46:32.480 --> 46:36.200]  in a new world order and a foreign global takeover by mega banks and all the rest of
[46:36.200 --> 46:39.880]  this go read the ADL Southern property law center demonizing yours truly now it's we're
[46:39.880 --> 46:46.240]  bad because we oppose it we're the real Americans black white it doesn't matter they want to
[46:46.240 --> 46:52.240]  frame it though like only hillbillies from Michigan or Texas in all these video games
[46:52.240 --> 46:57.520]  or Tennessee or Alabama oh I don't want to be pro you know sovereignty and bill of rights
[46:57.520 --> 47:02.080]  that's only white crackers that do that I mean that's it you know the media always calls
[47:02.080 --> 47:05.080]  me and goes to your financial sovereignty and don't want open borders don't want carbon
[47:05.080 --> 47:09.560]  taxes and don't want your guns taken are you a racist the awesome record statesman asked
[47:09.560 --> 47:13.880]  me that one time and actually published it at I said what how do you respond to a question
[47:13.880 --> 47:21.920]  like that what does this have to do with race it was an issue of guns wasn't even borders
[47:21.920 --> 47:29.480]  and this is what they do I am an American patriot whose family goes back on both sides
[47:29.480 --> 47:36.040]  to the founding not of the country but to what became the colonies my family has been
[47:36.040 --> 47:40.400]  here on both sides from the beginning my family has done nothing in both sides of its lineage
[47:40.400 --> 47:45.600]  but defend liberty and defend freedom and defend this country and help found the state
[47:45.600 --> 47:51.280]  of Texas and I won't even get into all of that I'm a real American I'm a good guy I
[47:51.280 --> 47:56.400]  recognize the enemy takeover it's in my guts it's in my jeans it's in my blood that's why
[47:56.400 --> 48:01.160]  I didn't have to be told to do this I instantly began resisting it from day one as soon as
[48:01.160 --> 48:05.200]  I discovered it and that's not because I'm a hero it's because I simply want justice
[48:05.200 --> 48:09.120]  and liberty I don't like being conquered I don't like being usurped I don't like seeing
[48:09.120 --> 48:14.280]  paramilitary police parading around openly preparing for war with the American people
[48:14.280 --> 48:18.360]  I'm not the enemy of these police either they've been incrementally brainwashed brought into
[48:18.360 --> 48:22.760]  this from birth the cartoons are all about you in occupation the cartoons when I was
[48:22.760 --> 48:29.680]  a kid were about gun owners being bad we have been brought up in a giant lie and it's time
[48:29.680 --> 48:38.900]  to awaken from it no you know Leo nine go pull it up on FEMA's own website troops from
[48:38.900 --> 48:44.680]  fifteen countries trained to deal with the civil unrest in America they will bring in
[48:44.680 --> 48:49.400]  foreign troops and by then it'll be so acclimated the uniforms have already been merged a decade
[48:49.400 --> 48:54.800]  ago they've all joint trained the local police have trained with Russians and checks and Polish
[48:54.800 --> 49:00.800]  and it doesn't matter because it's part of a global mega banking plan that's playing
[49:00.800 --> 49:05.120]  the country's off against each other so there's a mega corporation above everything that then
[49:05.120 --> 49:09.040]  plays different regions off against each other you've got all these police programs in every
[49:09.040 --> 49:14.160]  major city where the police for twenty years are sent to Tokyo and then in the case of
[49:14.160 --> 49:18.800]  Austin and then the Tokyo cops come here and then they do agreements where they can arrest
[49:18.800 --> 49:27.240]  people there blah blah blah it's all global government look at Snowden he went to twenty
[49:27.240 --> 49:34.680]  countries twenty one nations asking for asylum and none of them but one communist state and
[49:34.680 --> 49:38.280]  as much as I don't like Venezuela socialist and communist I've told you they're rogue
[49:38.280 --> 49:40.520]  they're out there pretty much on their own that's what the whole world wants to bring
[49:40.520 --> 49:44.120]  them down I don't agree with their policies but that's its own country they're saying
[49:44.120 --> 49:47.760]  maybe but they're all so scared because it's not just America they're dealing with it's
[49:47.760 --> 49:51.400]  this global mafia where they want to be able to grab anybody they want anywhere where you
[49:51.400 --> 49:55.280]  have no rights you have no justice you have no privacy you have no freedom and then the
[49:55.280 --> 50:05.040]  made men of the UN Rockefeller Rothschild Saxe-Coburg-Gotha Combine they are one hundred and ten percent
[50:05.040 --> 50:10.840]  above the law and can do anything they want it even came out in the New York Times last
[50:10.840 --> 50:16.520]  year that the UN sent in trips in central Africa but also in South America and it lists
[50:16.520 --> 50:21.280]  the countries to kill whole villages of people when land had been laid aside as a carbon
[50:21.280 --> 50:29.360]  sink off limits they go and kill the villagers that live on it they they line them up and
[50:29.360 --> 50:35.240]  shoot them but hey Miss America always says the UN loves me and you know every good looking
[50:35.240 --> 50:38.960]  girl you see at the shopping malls wearing a unicef shirt because that's what good looking
[50:38.960 --> 50:44.160]  women do because they saw Miss America do it and Miss America and Miss USA they say you

[01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:43.640]  snowden there's a lot must be more to it than we see because i haven't i don't know what
[01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:49.720]  snowden has revealed other than it was fairly well known as far as what snowden said that
[01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:55.040]  we were looking at all the day they were the nsa was looking at the world's data well that's
[01:11:55.040 --> 01:12:01.360]  what all intelligence agencies do every country is a modern country has an intelligence agency
[01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:07.960]  and said that bears go poop in the woods and you can expect everything to be looked at
[01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:15.680]  so so what so what's the big deal i don't know i am surprised if they really want i
[01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:19.640]  think that if they really wanted snowden out of the picture they would have immediately
[01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:26.440]  killed him like they have others so even if he's hiding them out the Moscow airport that
[01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:33.320]  doesn't mean he's assassination proof anybody can come by and shoot him or whatever are giving
[01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:40.280]  him an injection and he'd be gone that's right they've got those poison ice darts is is is
[01:12:40.280 --> 01:12:45.120]  coming in a different ways to shoot a little ice dart it's got cyanide in but i'm you're
[01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:53.080]  well rison's become a favorite also anyway i don't see what the big deal is about snowden
[01:12:53.080 --> 01:13:00.120]  other than something is going on they're covering up well i think they're i think he's real but
[01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:04.720]  they're using him because he is somebody that ran to a foreign country to just scare all
[01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:10.000]  the other whistleblowers and the biggest thing it does is this the way the communist system
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:19.160]  worked in east germany and the communist and and you if you half of the people were involved
[01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:26.880]  with the security services and so if you said anything to the wrong person or had a thought
[01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:35.120]  committed a thought crime that somebody overheard you got thrown in the gulag are killed and
[01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:39.040]  so that made you afraid to talk to anybody else you wouldn't cooperate with anybody
[01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:44.880]  else to establish a new political realm or that's how they destroyed the individual was
[01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:49.280]  by naming political dissent as terrorism as they're not doing here and i think this is
[01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:55.600]  the deal with snowden now you must be more are you're more aware that if you say anything
[01:13:55.600 --> 01:14:00.920]  on the phone are you try to coordinate with anybody on the email you might as well run
[01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:04.440]  it in the new york time well that's what pat cenic pat cenic called when this all broke
[01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:10.600]  and he said alex it's a sigh up this is i know general alexander i maybe we should get
[01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:15.480]  him on but he goes this is being done to bring all this out to create a conversation about
[01:14:15.480 --> 01:14:23.160]  it well it's done that but i don't think snowden knows what he's doing and then it forces us
[01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:27.080]  to defend him because of the free speech issues and they're trying to persecute the press
[01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:31.240]  but then it changes the subject from a week before he came out it was all in essay spying
[01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:38.960]  on the press see it's an issue of who they're spying on yes well you can assume anything
[01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:43.680]  you say or do will be monitored now listen i thought i could talk about what you told
[01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:47.840]  us in here last week and i want to get into the nasa stuff but since i've already set
[01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:54.200]  it out there specifically many people know i don't make stuff up what were you told when
[01:14:54.200 --> 01:15:01.280]  you graduated from an intelligence agency oh they tell they tell you going in that if
[01:15:01.280 --> 01:15:07.400]  you get at too far out of line they may kill you and and that was if you talk we're gonna
[01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:13.800]  kill you essentially what specifically just i don't remember the exact words long and
[01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:17.720]  you said to them at the graduation though you were sitting around you know like at the
[01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:22.840]  final well you had a debriefing where you're not allowed to go to travel outside the country
[01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:29.720]  without permission for so a certain length of time and essentially not allowed to work
[01:15:29.720 --> 01:15:36.000]  for various people for several years now now they reported the shuttle program you worked
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:44.840]  on was at least 80 secret military operations did you work on those yes but you're talking
[01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:51.400]  about payloads now i didn't really have much to do with the actual payloads the shuttle
[01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:59.280]  was flying in order to launch satellites the shuttle would carry a say a communication
[01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:06.080]  satellite up but it would have its own rocket and the words when you got it up into orbit
[01:16:06.080 --> 01:16:13.640]  you then set it outside the payload bay and after getting a safe distance away from it
[01:16:13.640 --> 01:16:18.760]  you would light the engine and put it into whatever orbit it was intended to be in and
[01:16:18.760 --> 01:16:24.920]  that was done many times over but there was anything especially secret about it except
[01:16:24.920 --> 01:16:29.920]  those the payloads now well i apologize if i said too much but i but you said none of
[01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:35.040]  this is really classified you talked about you know the 97 hearings on the CIA solicitor
[01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:38.120]  general and rug dealing and you just said that it was well known in the intelligence
[01:16:38.120 --> 01:16:43.800]  community watching the communiques that it was just all over the place correct correct
[01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:50.960]  and there are other things for instance here's a book here that i read like they'd be elite
[01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:58.200]  serial killers of linkin jfk rfk and mlk robert galin ross shall we sell that book okay well
[01:16:58.200 --> 01:17:03.480]  the most amazing thing about it is when i especially on the description of the jfk
[01:17:03.480 --> 01:17:12.160]  i worked with an engineer some time ago who lived in dallas grew up in dallas knew a bunch
[01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:18.800]  people on the dallas police force and we got into discussions over the jfk assassination
[01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:22.840]  up to the point where he was really afraid of me and afraid to say anything else and
[01:17:22.840 --> 01:17:29.080]  this was many years after the assassination and he was still afraid to talk about it i
[01:17:29.080 --> 01:17:32.920]  was on an airplane with a well-known lawyer i'll just leave it that bodies with the bushes
[01:17:32.920 --> 01:17:37.600]  and he was just flying back from dallas when i flew in from london and he was just like
[01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:42.320]  going to course i grew up with my ranch next door to the lawyer that was running the whole
[01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:45.840]  thing i mean it's just in dallas it's well known i mean it's only an idiot knows they
[01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:53.760]  didn't kill kennedy well and the book explains the frightening thing about our whole country
[01:17:53.760 --> 01:17:59.360]  their whole system is we have sunk in morality to the point where you can have most of the
[01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:07.080]  government officials of a city and of a state and of a nation in on an assassination and
[01:18:07.080 --> 01:18:11.920]  that's viewed as all right this normal course of doing business what do you think about
[01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:18.600]  hastings michael hastings of the rolling stone well i didn't know his work or him or anything
[01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:24.800]  about him and yes i believe just like this one that got killed in houston that was assassinated
[01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:31.640]  he is i didn't know him either but uh yeah that's an example of but nowadays they just
[01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:36.840]  blow your car up and then the wife's come out through his friends and tweets and things
[01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:41.000]  and i've talked to his army buddy and they believe he was killed they want investigation
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:47.640]  you'd think that would be news well when you have something like pat tillman go on and
[01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:55.400]  many other examples somewhat similar to that how can we do anything as a nation anymore
[01:18:55.400 --> 01:19:01.640]  there's nobody to turn to there's nobody that is has an overall power to have set things
[01:19:01.640 --> 01:19:08.320]  right to make a moral judgment to provide moral leadership apparently and then once you reach
[01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:13.160]  that point though it only gets worse in history because once it's the rule of the fog once
[01:19:13.160 --> 01:19:17.680]  it's the rule of assassination death squads it's over they'll take everything and even
[01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:22.520]  if the dons that are in place now won't do it they will be replaced by people that want
[01:19:22.520 --> 01:19:30.080]  to do it the worst for the worst then take over well there's no end of the greed in other
[01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:38.200]  words uh in football and everything else nothing is ever good enough as part of our big problems
[01:19:38.200 --> 01:19:43.160]  we don't have enough money we don't have enough of the house we don't have enough of anything
[01:19:43.160 --> 01:19:48.720]  this is the general attitude in the public and so they're willing to sell themselves
[01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:52.880]  to get more always get more because they know and in truth they're going to lose everything
[01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:57.880]  as they sold out that's right we'll be right back ramon stay there i want to get into uh
[01:19:57.880 --> 01:20:02.840]  i want to get into nasa secrets straight ahead i'm not secrets digestive health is the key

[01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:37.920]  is going to be faved in this is an important talk on air because then my writers paul watson
[01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:42.560]  curtain and others who have an understanding of this as well can go off my talking points
[01:24:42.560 --> 01:24:46.960]  they can go look up everything I'm going to say they just search whatever I say and then
[01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:52.120]  articles and documents come up and then they'll write stories on it because no one has given
[01:24:52.120 --> 01:24:59.040]  everybody the full picture except myself and that is not a good feeling that is not a good
[01:24:59.040 --> 01:25:04.640]  feeling the people that came the closest to it 50 years ago were john birth society and
[01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:08.320]  that's because they had military insiders that were patriots and leaked hey we're being
[01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:12.520]  told we're going to be occupied by you and troops people like oh yeah crazy man we're
[01:25:12.520 --> 01:25:15.680]  going to explain how this works it's not just us is going to get occupied it's going to
[01:25:15.680 --> 01:25:20.400]  be everybody Raymond I want to get into the fact of did we go to the moon because there
[01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:24.440]  you are on the major Apollo missions you're being told it's all happening but you told
[01:25:24.440 --> 01:25:29.200]  me off air you said look well I mean repeat what you said and then tell me about the Russian
[01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:33.760]  engineer you worked with and what they said okay one more thing I'm going to put on for
[01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:41.760]  Snowden that nobody has looked at this while Snowden is not such a big deal and all of
[01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:49.000]  these companies I've worked for which is several three solid state companies here device manufacturers
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:58.660]  they have in their employee Chinese and Indian and other people that are from China from
[01:25:58.660 --> 01:26:03.560]  the from most oh yeah they're all in it the stuff's manufactured over there they go home
[01:26:03.560 --> 01:26:09.720]  to visit their families they go home to set up things some of them go quit and go home
[01:26:09.720 --> 01:26:14.480]  and set up for their own factory so what is the big deal you know we've we're going to
[01:26:14.480 --> 01:26:20.480]  hire all these the rest of the world to build our stuff here then they know what's going
[01:26:20.480 --> 01:26:24.600]  on you don't have to worry about it being stolen you've already given it away that's
[01:26:24.600 --> 01:26:28.920]  right the hardware the Pentagon comes out and says we want to know what you're thinking
[01:26:28.920 --> 01:26:32.480]  five years ago we're tracking everything you do we have a computer that has a model of
[01:26:32.480 --> 01:26:37.560]  the world in it and the head of the CIA says your dishwasher is watching you were listening
[01:26:37.560 --> 01:26:43.400]  to you but then Snowden says it's a bad idea oh he's a trader what he's a trader for is
[01:26:43.400 --> 01:26:49.640]  saying it's bad that's the real underlying message well you agree without a statement
[01:26:49.640 --> 01:26:57.880]  or well yes I'd say that the the government are on the highest levels is afraid they're
[01:26:57.880 --> 01:27:05.240]  going to get overthrown of all the corrupt and dirty deals they're involved in the other
[01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:10.880]  night I watched a film on the amount of money that was covered up was being handled in the
[01:27:10.880 --> 01:27:16.920]  World Trade Center there were billions of dollars that were lost from the books because
[01:27:16.920 --> 01:27:24.600]  billions in gold disappeared at the bottom and so there were thousands of people killed
[01:27:24.600 --> 01:27:31.240]  and then billions of dollars worth of property destroyed just to cover that up how shameful
[01:27:31.240 --> 01:27:38.600]  and no real investigation in fact now I'm told or I've heard that in the anniversary
[01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:44.440]  of coming up they don't want any of the firefighters and the New York City police down oh no that's
[01:27:44.440 --> 01:27:49.040]  two in a row they're not allowed yeah not allowed how absolutely ridiculous well look
[01:27:49.040 --> 01:27:53.720]  at how the it's not just the Secretary of Defense but top generals now won't be around
[01:27:53.720 --> 01:27:59.360]  troops with guns I mean but again this is all planned this is all planned what they're
[01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:07.920]  doing well just like the gun free school zones you don't bring a gun around a Roman Emperor
[01:28:07.920 --> 01:28:12.720]  you don't bring a gun around a general I'm telling you this is an enemy force so of course
[01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:16.920]  they hate the military I mean that's why I can't even get mad at cops when they run around
[01:28:16.920 --> 01:28:21.040]  and act like psycho goons they've been trained where the enemy they've been given paramilitary
[01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:25.480]  training occupation training and they think this is normal they think this is how they
[01:28:25.480 --> 01:28:30.560]  go home at night instead it's gearing them up for a civil war you have any idea how many
[01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:33.820]  cops are going to get wiped out when they start this thing and I don't I'm not happy
[01:28:33.820 --> 01:28:40.120]  about it it's going to be very nasty if they started but one of the things that urge me
[01:28:40.120 --> 01:28:46.640]  right now they're very quick to use their weapons well they're wearing body armor they're pretty
[01:28:46.640 --> 01:28:51.760]  well protected so I mean they they now shoot people every day I see articles where a guy
[01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:56.160]  gets out and has a pen in his hand or and they just it's instinctive shooting which I get
[01:28:56.160 --> 01:29:00.440]  makes you a good shot but the thing is you know you've got a weight belt in your car
[01:29:00.440 --> 01:29:04.160]  they shoot you in the head you get out with your license and it glimmers they shoot you
[01:29:04.160 --> 01:29:09.080]  they don't even think it's like you know okay they're out they're not in that much danger
[01:29:09.080 --> 01:29:13.840]  unless the P their perpetrator is going to make a headshot on them which you'd probably
[01:29:13.840 --> 01:29:19.680]  need a high-powered rifle to do they really you really can't kill one well it's not even
[01:29:19.680 --> 01:29:24.160]  an issue now if you look statistically it's car wrecks that are killing cops but they're
[01:29:24.160 --> 01:29:27.960]  all walking around absolutely scared to death about to be killed but Raymond we got to get
[01:29:27.960 --> 01:29:32.200]  to the NASA news okay I know it's hard for you to talk about this stuff but I want you
[01:29:32.200 --> 01:29:35.680]  to tell me what you told me the other day okay we're going to break we're going to get
[01:29:35.680 --> 01:29:38.600]  you on your piece you can actually hear because I know that it's confusing when the brakes
[01:29:38.600 --> 01:29:44.760]  are we're going to come right back with the insider Air Force intelligence the NSA connected
[01:29:44.760 --> 01:29:54.960]  the frontline NASA you name it we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and
[01:29:54.960 --> 01:30:04.480]  the GCN radio network Oklahoma reminds us there are many kinds of storms in our lives
[01:30:04.480 --> 01:30:10.360]  nature regularly sends us destructive storms 24 hours before a storm strikes people panic
[01:30:10.360 --> 01:30:15.680]  it would be wise to prepare ahead of the panic curve the food price storm from drought and
[01:30:15.680 --> 01:30:20.840]  livestock problems is forecast to hit ridiculous heights by the end of the summer wonder if

[01:32:09.920 --> 01:32:16.880]  billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your
[01:32:16.880 --> 01:32:22.880]  psyche from compulsory state education to the hollywood media brainwashing machine we
[01:32:22.880 --> 01:32:28.020]  are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions when somebody obscures
[01:32:28.020 --> 01:32:32.440]  that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying it they can take
[01:32:32.440 --> 01:32:36.560]  total control of your awareness all of this is happening so fast you need to be ahead
[01:32:36.560 --> 01:32:41.680]  of the game how to engineer the opinion of the american people so that they would not
[01:32:41.680 --> 01:32:48.400]  only endorse but demand war another one another plane just a state of mind because there's
[01:32:48.400 --> 01:32:54.800]  a war on or your mind get your copy of state of mind the movie at info wars dot com and

[01:33:06.760 --> 01:33:20.080]  answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the alex jones show you know I had to twist
[01:33:20.080 --> 01:33:24.800]  his arm a little bit to get Raymond to come in here and talk about this he's always privately
[01:33:24.800 --> 01:33:28.160]  talking about stuff nothing classified but just things that he's able to speak about
[01:33:28.160 --> 01:33:31.920]  it's always amazing as you got to come in so what's going to happen is we've got professor
[01:33:31.920 --> 01:33:35.960]  griff coming up I got a bunch of news thing to get to Raymond is going to be on the nightly
[01:33:35.960 --> 01:33:40.640]  news tonight I'm not sure who's hosting is it jacari jackson rob do Darren McBreen is
[01:33:40.640 --> 01:33:45.920]  it david night I'm not sure who's doing it tonight Watson was scheduled but Watson's
[01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:52.080]  going to be co hosting Friday all three hours so he's not doing tonight but Raymond says
[01:33:52.080 --> 01:33:57.160]  he's up to do it to really talk for 3040 minutes commercial free during the interview to just
[01:33:57.160 --> 01:34:02.920]  get into Snowden NASA and really kind of let him just roll with it so we're going to get
[01:34:02.920 --> 01:34:09.560]  that set up right now for info wars nightly news seven o'clock tonight central with Raymond
[01:34:09.560 --> 01:34:15.040]  T we'll go take that right after this show today Raymond for those that just joined us
[01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:20.000]  you were a NASA engineer we can put up the photo of you on the Apollo missions frontline
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:24.520]  you know they're running a lot of the systems you were then over the cameras on the shuttle
[01:34:24.520 --> 01:34:29.680]  program you obviously did some other classified programs you can't talk about but you were
[01:34:29.680 --> 01:34:34.600]  getting into the NSA now we're segueing into because I took it from what you told me years
[01:34:34.600 --> 01:34:40.720]  ago that look to you like it went to the moon look to you you later worked at RCA corporation
[01:34:40.720 --> 01:34:46.640]  as well they had cameras there but then later you said you could see how well we say it in
[01:34:46.640 --> 01:34:52.840]  your own words that that that that they could fake this just like on norad they were having
[01:34:52.840 --> 01:34:57.840]  a simulation of the very thing happening Raymond again I tell people how many Apollo programs
[01:34:57.840 --> 01:35:02.080]  you worked on and what your gut level is and then what that Russian engineer you were friends
[01:35:02.080 --> 01:35:09.760]  with told you well I've been asked this before even on this program and by many people
[01:35:09.760 --> 01:35:19.720]  did we actually go to the moon and I would say well yes I believe we did but I cannot
[01:35:19.720 --> 01:35:24.400]  be absolutely sure and the reason I can't be absolutely sure from the things I've seen
[01:35:24.400 --> 01:35:29.560]  and can relate to you you would be certain that we did but at the same time from other
[01:35:29.560 --> 01:35:37.960]  things I've seen go on we might not have now one of the many instances I worked with a
[01:35:37.960 --> 01:35:45.680]  patriotic Russian engineer on a solid state program for a company here there's a camera
[01:35:45.680 --> 01:35:53.960]  over there brother look at them okay so and we became pretty good friends anyway discussing
[01:35:53.960 --> 01:36:03.080]  things like this he told me no you did not go to the moon it was all staged well I don't
[01:36:03.080 --> 01:36:09.000]  see how we would have staged Apollo 13 whoever put that one together would be the ultimate
[01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:14.680]  and suspense adventure writing if they put the mission Apollo 13 together because there
[01:36:14.680 --> 01:36:20.440]  was just too many things to be thought of and too many details the rest of it but they've
[01:36:20.440 --> 01:36:25.200]  now leaked that there's dead Russians on the moon all sorts of disasters a lot of I've
[01:36:25.200 --> 01:36:29.680]  been told by high-level people off record that there's a large not just hundreds of
[01:36:29.680 --> 01:36:34.080]  deaths in secret space plane programs but hundreds of deaths and you add them up it's
[01:36:34.080 --> 01:36:38.440]  even more than that in secret space programs I mean it's admitted there's a secret space
[01:36:38.440 --> 01:36:44.440]  program Bob Bowman's talked about that were you involved in any of the secret space program
[01:36:44.440 --> 01:36:48.920]  no not really now I know I've heard rumors the Russians apparently have lost quite a
[01:36:48.920 --> 01:36:54.080]  few people and of course we lost three on the very first one burned up right on the
[01:36:54.080 --> 01:37:05.240]  pad and that was tragic and then of course we had the Columbia accident so lost a few
[01:37:05.240 --> 01:37:09.560]  people but we sure lost anywhere near what apparently the Russians have lost but they've
[01:37:09.560 --> 01:37:15.600]  done a lot more flying than we have so if the more you fly them well what are the Russian
[01:37:15.600 --> 01:37:20.680]  engineer explained to you and break down break down you're being fed info and you were saying
[01:37:20.680 --> 01:37:25.640]  they have you doing drills all the time of the same thing you don't know drill from real
[01:37:25.640 --> 01:37:31.680]  okay now I think you've gotten a wrong impression on what I told you is explain it explain it
[01:37:31.680 --> 01:37:37.200]  yeah okay alright let's say you're in a you're an assimilator that amounts to your personal
[01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:42.920]  car and you're driving down the highway and now you've got controllers that put problems
[01:37:42.920 --> 01:37:47.160]  in there that you're supposed to solve in order to be able to keep your driver's license
[01:37:47.160 --> 01:37:52.560]  up whenever let's say you're tooling off down the highway here and all of a sudden you get
[01:37:52.560 --> 01:37:59.240]  an oil pressure light your oil pressure is gone this means you've got 15 seconds or less
[01:37:59.240 --> 01:38:05.320]  to save your engine if you're going to solve the engine problem you've got to shut the
[01:38:05.320 --> 01:38:11.520]  engine down almost immediately otherwise it's going to be ruined now if you're not going
[01:38:11.520 --> 01:38:17.000]  to lose any altitude and probably not crash if you lose oil pressure in your car but it
[01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:24.240]  requires instant reaction well on the spacecraft there are systems many systems that might get
[01:38:24.240 --> 01:38:31.680]  you killed you might wind up with no oxygen no power too high level of CO2 there's lots
[01:38:31.680 --> 01:38:37.000]  of life support involved and if the system goes out and you take no action then you will
[01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:44.800]  wind up dead and this is part of the big problem on Apollo 13 the oxygen canisters are the
[01:38:44.800 --> 01:38:53.040]  CO2 removal canisters on the command module did not fit the ones on the limb the lunar
[01:38:53.040 --> 01:39:02.680]  magic module and they had to do a big they had to invent overnight with with the stuff
[01:39:02.680 --> 01:39:11.960]  that was on it on board the the spacecraft so and the limb to to figure out how to forget
[01:39:11.960 --> 01:39:18.960]  the error what were you doing on Apollo 13 well I said the first thing I did was call
[01:39:18.960 --> 01:39:25.040]  in all of the rest of our our troop and everybody else did the same so we had three shifts in
[01:39:25.040 --> 01:39:32.080]  the mission control room at one time not only that they called in the people that that were
[01:39:32.080 --> 01:39:37.960]  the support people that did the training that called in all of their people to to figure
[01:39:37.960 --> 01:39:43.960]  out what to do to get around fire supply problems air filtration problems and it had to be done
[01:39:43.960 --> 01:39:49.720]  with stuff that was on board they had to use duct tape and cardboard and and so forth to
[01:39:49.720 --> 01:39:58.280]  make adapters to get these to work and so you worked on that well I we were in a tremendous
[01:39:58.280 --> 01:40:04.920]  position at that time the three people I worked with on guidance and control we monitored
[01:40:04.920 --> 01:40:11.800]  the guidance system and the state vectors in other words the direction the didn't they
[01:40:11.800 --> 01:40:16.080]  have like radio telescopes and things and radio trackers to be able to I mean I mean
[01:40:16.080 --> 01:40:22.480]  certainly the spacecraft went out to the moon oh you had three different stations around
[01:40:22.480 --> 01:40:27.840]  the world that kept track of all that sent received all the communications and the data
[01:40:27.840 --> 01:40:30.920]  sure because from the evidence I've seen I believe it went to the moon as well from
[01:40:30.920 --> 01:40:35.800]  the intel I've got go is that there was a whole nother secret mission there as backup
[01:40:35.800 --> 01:40:40.800]  no yeah and so that's not going on no there was not okay well then how could it have been
[01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:49.480]  fake then just devil's advocate well if you're sitting in a room here and you see at a display
[01:40:49.480 --> 01:40:56.080]  of instrumentation like all the save the instrumentation on your car your your your gas
[01:40:56.080 --> 01:41:00.960]  gauge or sure they can feed bad info into that they yes they can control all the info
[01:41:00.960 --> 01:41:05.480]  and make you believe that something else is going on of the but in this case that was
[01:41:05.480 --> 01:41:09.240]  not the case but they'd have to have a whole nother room of other engineers know how to
[01:41:09.240 --> 01:41:18.640]  fool engineers well this they did they had the whole bottom floor of the IBM 360 computers
[01:41:18.640 --> 01:41:24.120]  plus all these staff support rooms and part of them were devoted to putting into problems
[01:41:24.120 --> 01:41:31.920]  to train us to recognize when you had a problem now let me finish on what I was going to tell
[01:41:31.920 --> 01:41:40.000]  you the navigation system did not go down when the oxygen tank blew up it knocked the
[01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:48.120]  fuel cell power generators offline and so and it blew most of the circuit breakers but
[01:41:48.120 --> 01:41:54.240]  what happened was just like in an aircraft if you're familiar with aircraft operations
[01:41:54.240 --> 01:42:01.480]  you have an endless stream of emergency procedures you're supposed to follow you pick out what
[01:42:01.480 --> 01:42:05.200]  seems to be the most appropriate and you start going down a checklist and checking things
[01:42:05.200 --> 01:42:11.320]  off to see how where you are in the system how your system is working well this was absolutely
[01:42:11.320 --> 01:42:16.600]  endless an Apollo they had everything but they didn't have this because this was not
[01:42:16.600 --> 01:42:22.400]  something that was supposed to be survivable and what happened they lost all the power
[01:42:22.400 --> 01:42:26.960]  well they were afraid just to turn all the circuit breakers back on because it might
[01:42:26.960 --> 01:42:35.360]  all go up in flames they know what was wrong so about 45 minutes later when they finally
[01:42:35.360 --> 01:42:39.320]  found out what the problem really was got they got the right circuit breakers on to show
[01:42:39.320 --> 01:42:46.960]  that the the systems engineer monitoring the fuel cells on the oxygen hydrogen levels found
[01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:54.760]  said flight we've got 30 minutes of power left he came back 10 minutes later and said
[01:42:54.760 --> 01:43:00.720]  we've got less than 10 minutes well this was a disaster because without the power on
[01:43:00.720 --> 01:43:05.600]  and the nav system running there was no chance and this was being kept secret from the public
[01:43:05.600 --> 01:43:11.920]  no it wasn't well at the time it wasn't broadcast but it's the whole movie but no no you're not
[01:43:11.920 --> 01:43:15.160]  giving anything secret on that I got it Raymond all you're doing is trying to not give anything
[01:43:15.160 --> 01:43:19.360]  secret out now now what about the suicide pills what was the procedure if they were
[01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:24.240]  going to die just wait and suffocate or take pills I never heard anything about suicide
[01:43:24.240 --> 01:43:37.400]  pills they may have had some but actually running out of oxygen if you're in a if you're
[01:43:37.400 --> 01:43:43.960]  in a pressure system for instance you just go to sleep you will take about three or four
[01:43:43.960 --> 01:43:49.360]  breaths and then you will be passed out and you will never know what happened to you you
[01:43:49.360 --> 01:43:55.000]  will not know you will not feel it coming and you will not know what happened that's
[01:43:55.000 --> 01:44:01.440]  part of the problems and what happened on some of the spatial accidents I'm not spatial
[01:44:01.440 --> 01:44:09.560]  well even that but people they'd purge areas with nitrogen to get hydrazine out of it make
[01:44:09.560 --> 01:44:16.560]  sure there was no hydrazine left and it lingers well box you know the your normal error is
[01:44:16.560 --> 01:44:21.760]  28% nitrogen but if you went in there too quick or didn't have the enough oxygen put
[01:44:21.760 --> 01:44:29.920]  in or wearing a scuba system to supply your air or oxygen then you would die well well
[01:44:29.920 --> 01:44:32.600]  Raymond we're almost out of time you're gonna be able to talk about whatever you want on
[01:44:32.600 --> 01:44:36.240]  the nightly news tonight you're a really interesting guy again a good friend of mine for 15 years
[01:44:36.240 --> 01:44:41.080]  joining us here specifically then you're saying you're saying they could have been feeding
[01:44:41.080 --> 01:44:45.880]  you guys fake data but then weren't there other governments and things also they do this
[01:44:45.880 --> 01:44:50.760]  mirror test now where they fire a laser from the observatory out in west Texas and hit
[01:44:50.760 --> 01:44:54.880]  the mirrors on the moon but then I guess the argument there is they could have a satellite
[01:44:54.880 --> 01:45:04.240]  with a robot like Viking place mirrors okay I haven't there's the Apollo 13 was on a non
[01:45:04.240 --> 01:45:11.920]  free return orbit it would crash into the moon if you did not make a maneuver to circularize
[01:45:11.920 --> 01:45:20.360]  your your entry into lunar orbit so they had to make a burn and shut it down anyway they
[01:45:20.360 --> 01:45:28.240]  were running out of power and the nav systems were going down so normally we would verify
[01:45:28.240 --> 01:45:37.480]  the data once mainly the the locking ring mechanism between the command module and the lunar module
[01:45:37.480 --> 01:45:42.760]  there were marks on it and you had to align these and normally we'd run them three times
[01:45:42.760 --> 01:45:48.480]  read them three times make sure everything was actually perfect for committing we were
[01:45:48.480 --> 01:45:56.840]  we did it once very rapid committing is firing thrusters firing the they used a limbo motor
[01:45:56.840 --> 01:46:02.280]  to make this because the CSM there was something wrong with it but we didn't know what and
[01:46:02.280 --> 01:46:09.000]  that's the that that's the normal actuators no this was you know the normal on the command
[01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:14.440]  module had a large motor on it that was doing mainly use no no I got it they couldn't use
[01:46:14.440 --> 01:46:18.640]  the normal thruster controls yes this was an alternative to use the main engine right
[01:46:18.640 --> 01:46:26.280]  well the main they used a landing engine for them that was intended to to lower to the
[01:46:26.280 --> 01:46:31.280]  so what's the bottom line we're going to break okay the bottom line was only God brought
[01:46:31.280 --> 01:46:39.520]  us back we never expected anybody to get back from this because the problems were so immense
[01:46:39.520 --> 01:46:44.560]  you had to do it with enormous accuracy when they did it pretty why haven't we gone back
[01:46:44.560 --> 01:46:48.080]  to the moon because look I know there's a lot of suppressed technology they've got black
[01:46:48.080 --> 01:46:56.920]  man on space planes but dr. Bob this is one of the big problems when Robert rack McNamara
[01:46:56.920 --> 01:47:01.720]  and I don't know what he had to anyhow he ordered the drawings and all the tooling for
[01:47:01.720 --> 01:47:08.520]  the Saturn 5 rocket destroyed I saw that well when he which was really verner von bronze
[01:47:08.520 --> 01:47:16.440]  design anybody I mean everyone all of the NASA people were in shock because they knew
[01:47:16.440 --> 01:47:21.080]  that before they had anything else to fly with it would be 10 years so a lot of them
[01:47:21.080 --> 01:47:29.360]  were still using the Russian heavy boaster right that's right and I mean this was treason
[01:47:29.360 --> 01:47:34.520]  of the highest order they just literally abandoned the space program well they had enough rockets
[01:47:34.520 --> 01:47:43.360]  to fly through Apollo 17 already manufactured but at the same time and this was done during
[01:47:43.360 --> 01:47:50.880]  2012 so this was one of the strange things it seemed like they wanted to bail out of
[01:47:50.880 --> 01:47:56.200]  the space program the government wanted to bail out of the Apollo program I can tell
[01:47:56.200 --> 01:48:02.080]  you why the decision was made then to go with robots man isn't going to go into space we're
[01:48:02.080 --> 01:48:05.960]  going nowhere it's over the elite believe they're going to merge with machines they
[01:48:05.960 --> 01:48:10.160]  all say this and that they're not going to let the idea of us going to space it's over
[01:48:10.160 --> 01:48:14.240]  the decision's been made to bring in the world government bring in the technocracy release
[01:48:14.240 --> 01:48:18.480]  the bioweapons kill everybody and the elite are going to merge with the machines which
[01:48:18.480 --> 01:48:22.320]  of course is a lie of Lucifer they're not going to be given eternal life either but
[01:48:22.320 --> 01:48:26.000]  that they all say that that's their actual plan that's why they killed the real space
[01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:30.400]  program well they killed the real space program when they when they destroyed the tooling for
[01:48:30.400 --> 01:48:34.360]  building the rocket well here's an example verner von bronze with the space shuttle idea
[01:48:34.360 --> 01:48:39.360]  in 35 in Germany was the head of the rocket program he came up with the Saturn program
[01:48:39.360 --> 01:48:45.200]  around then was able to then deploy at a genius though he was a Nazi and and now we can't
[01:48:45.200 --> 01:48:50.320]  even have stuff that good again they frozen our development while they have an advanced
[01:48:50.320 --> 01:48:55.040]  development that's what bowman who was the head of the star wars program says he said
[01:48:55.040 --> 01:48:58.040]  when he was the head of the program in the late 70s before they even announced it they
[01:48:58.040 --> 01:49:05.720]  already had hundreds of unmanned decapitation weapons in space with d.u. sabos meteor guns
[01:49:05.720 --> 01:49:10.600]  and he said he can only say that because they'd accidentally declassified part of that did
[01:49:10.600 --> 01:49:16.440]  you ever anything about it any of that about that what it seems strange don't we eliminate
[01:49:16.440 --> 01:49:23.000]  our capability to go into space and at least in a visible way we've never looked back at
[01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:30.200]  the hardware that was left on the moon with that could be done with well here's the issue
[01:49:30.200 --> 01:49:34.000]  why not just focus telescopes up there and show all the wreckage there's enough private
[01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:40.160]  telescopes in the landing zones I mean what you could do that with like a three-foot refractor
[01:49:40.160 --> 01:49:45.640]  on a mountaintop I don't think so but with the I don't know a digital photography they
[01:49:45.640 --> 01:49:50.600]  could blow it up I'm trying to think of the satellite normally does all this star pit
[01:49:50.600 --> 01:49:55.440]  Hubble Hubble yes with Hubble you should be able to pick up the yeah amen at the moon landing
[01:49:55.440 --> 01:49:59.400]  site and there he is another hardware that were left on the surface should be able to
[01:49:59.400 --> 01:50:03.720]  see that and I'm surprised that none of that has been done they've never admitted going
[01:50:03.720 --> 01:50:08.200]  yeah have the public in let them see the the the readout or send they'd say they just fake
[01:50:08.200 --> 01:50:16.960]  the feed so anyhow strange that we've never gone back we've never what is your gut tell
[01:50:16.960 --> 01:50:20.640]  you I mean you worked on the Apollo program frontline what is your gut tell you Raymond
[01:50:20.640 --> 01:50:28.040]  I would say that the shuttle program has been a cover for what is actually going on and
[01:50:28.040 --> 01:50:32.480]  I don't know what's going on except we it does not make sense that they threw all this
[01:50:32.480 --> 01:50:38.480]  capability away and we've done nothing since then we'll see America's not meant to have
[01:50:38.480 --> 01:50:41.920]  that looks like we get the Panama Canal to the Chinese we're being sold out I'm gonna
[01:50:41.920 --> 01:50:46.480]  explain that we come back Raymond you're gonna have the floor tonight on the nightly news

[01:54:31.440 --> 01:54:38.640]  and me Raymond Tiggs a great guy Alex Jones here back live I got a shotgun arrived but
[01:54:38.640 --> 01:54:46.160]  every time I start getting him on air to talk about stuff he won't talk about most of it
[01:54:46.160 --> 01:54:51.520]  and that's just the conditioning of all the programs he was involved in secret programs
[01:54:51.520 --> 01:54:57.840]  and he starts shaking a little bit when he starts to talk about it and it's not like
[01:54:57.840 --> 01:55:02.920]  he's telling me secret stuff when he's here I mean he was ready to not even tell people
[01:55:02.920 --> 01:55:08.280]  they kept Apollo 13 disaster secret for a few hours in case the astronauts died they
[01:55:08.280 --> 01:55:11.520]  wanted to be able to you know announce this so their families wouldn't be freaked out
[01:55:11.520 --> 01:55:19.600]  he was ready to not even talk about that because I said you kept that secret he's like oh Raymond
[01:55:19.600 --> 01:55:23.280]  Raymond's a really smart guy I tell you really interesting fun guy to go shooting with as
[01:55:23.280 --> 01:55:27.760]  well okay here's what's going on this kind of stuff always happens dealing with rock bands
[01:55:27.760 --> 01:55:32.640]  rock groups rap groups to the point of almost tell the crew it's like stop trying to set
[01:55:32.640 --> 01:55:38.640]  these interviews up you know if they fall in our lap I'll do them but I'm not really interested
[01:55:38.640 --> 01:55:42.160]  you know in it I was out yesterday and ran into a movie star and didn't even try to talk
[01:55:42.160 --> 01:55:47.240]  to him or interview him I like professor grip because he's interesting and he's informed
[01:55:47.240 --> 01:55:51.640]  and I'd like to get LL Cool J's take on something and Ice Cube will end up probably getting
[01:55:51.640 --> 01:55:58.440]  that tonight they they left a little late and thought they'd already be here from Dallas
[01:55:58.440 --> 01:56:03.400]  and I was like they're 30 minutes out an hour ago turns out they're like in temple right
[01:56:03.400 --> 01:56:08.840]  now and I guess they're gonna try to go drop griff off here or something who knows what'll
[01:56:08.840 --> 01:56:14.480]  happen so I'm not even worried about it but it'll either happen in overdrive today some
[01:56:14.480 --> 01:56:18.280]  stations carry the fourth hour or it'll be on the nightly news or it won't happen I'm
[01:56:18.280 --> 01:56:21.160]  not you know one way or the other we have a great interview with professor griff coming
[01:56:21.160 --> 01:56:25.560]  up for the Obama deception too but they're coming to town and wanted to come in so we'll
[01:56:25.560 --> 01:56:32.280]  see what happens that said I mean to me the big news is the Russian troops in America
[01:56:32.280 --> 01:56:37.920]  to patrol to patrol the American people and now I will start that in the second segment
[01:56:37.920 --> 01:56:43.240]  when some stations join us in the next hour I will start that big presentation what's
[01:56:43.240 --> 01:56:47.200]  behind it the history of it all of it then it's kind of a good thing I got behind and
[01:56:47.200 --> 01:56:51.600]  they got behind because this is really the big enchilada you want to understand everything
[01:56:51.600 --> 01:56:56.640]  else you've got to understand this because remember all the crazy old timers that crazy
[01:56:56.640 --> 01:57:00.920]  uncle who was an retired army colonel you know that you know said they were gonna bring in
[01:57:00.920 --> 01:57:07.760]  Russian troops and why why he's nuts and oh the NSA spy on us you know your crazy dad
[01:57:07.760 --> 01:57:14.280]  said oh but he worked in the government but wouldn't say where we had patriots folks when
[01:57:14.280 --> 01:57:20.960]  this whole plan was rolled out who warned everybody and now we're here so you better
[01:57:20.960 --> 01:57:25.160]  listen next hour that's all I'm saying I'll spend one segment on this and then I'm gonna
[01:57:25.160 --> 01:57:28.920]  get into Obama's compulsory service stuff they're calling up again I'm gonna get into
[01:57:28.920 --> 01:57:34.240]  this incredible video of the guy filming police from like 67 yards away they come in a resting
[01:57:34.240 --> 01:57:39.000]  man handling his dog jumps out of the window runs over they shoot it and the police say
[01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:44.200]  we thought the dog was gonna attack you I mean and again I'm not here to even if I just bash
[01:57:44.200 --> 01:57:48.640]  the police that helps the new world order that puts them more into their gang mentality
[01:57:48.640 --> 01:57:53.080]  I want to reach out to police and explain the brainwashing there under it ties into the
[01:57:53.080 --> 01:57:58.640]  Russian troops I'm gonna break all this down to show you the source documents on this okay
[01:57:58.640 --> 01:58:04.680]  not rumors the plan that print me in le09 just type in FEMA in le09 was on their site
[01:58:04.680 --> 01:58:10.280]  for two years they pulled it but their screenshots of it thanks I forgot that as an exhibit briefly
[01:58:10.280 --> 01:58:14.200]  we're going to break in 30 seconds if you believe in this show the enemy wants it shut
[01:58:14.200 --> 01:58:17.320]  down is doing dirty tricks that I won't even get into you need to spread the word about

[02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:08.680]  of the story here's michael savage from a syndicated radio transmission russian soldiers
[02:02:08.680 --> 02:02:14.240]  will be put on u.s. soil by obama to provide security at u.s. events that's right you heard
[02:02:14.240 --> 02:02:21.440]  me correctly as part of a deal signed last week in washington d.c. between the russkes
[02:02:21.440 --> 02:02:27.800]  and fema you know fema is don't you the people with the camps ready for you russian robbers
[02:02:27.800 --> 02:02:36.200]  are going to be put on u.s. soil to provide security at mass events in the united states
[02:02:36.200 --> 02:02:40.920]  do you have any idea what this means the use of foreign troops or other officials in the
[02:02:40.920 --> 02:02:47.800]  law enforcement capacity providing security inside the u.s. is illegal on the posse comatatus
[02:02:47.800 --> 02:02:56.080]  but it does not prevent this regime from violating the constitution again many people fear that
[02:02:56.080 --> 02:03:00.360]  this government is getting ready for some major action against the people they think
[02:03:00.360 --> 02:03:06.240]  that this gang that targeted their political enemies through the irs and through the nsa
[02:03:06.240 --> 02:03:12.440]  is getting ready to use foreign troops on this on soil on our soil who will not hesitate
[02:03:12.440 --> 02:03:19.360]  to shoot to kill that was signed just last week between fema and the russia the russian
[02:03:19.360 --> 02:03:24.920]  emergency situations ministry and fema where russian soldiers were will provide security
[02:03:24.920 --> 02:03:31.120]  at mass events in the united states this is illegal it's a violation of the posse comatatus
[02:03:31.120 --> 02:03:37.040]  act whoever signed on you for the u.s. government should go to prison just as the irs manager
[02:03:37.040 --> 02:03:42.720]  should go to prison just as other out of control government bureaucrats who belong who in my
[02:03:42.720 --> 02:03:47.320]  opinion belong in belong in eastern europe working for the stasi but this is what's
[02:03:47.320 --> 02:03:51.080]  emerged under this criminal administration i don't have any other words no do i have
[02:03:51.080 --> 02:03:56.040]  the time to mince words obama is a gangster he's run he's running the country like he's
[02:03:56.040 --> 02:04:01.840]  a gangster commander not like the president of all the people but we the people now have
[02:04:01.840 --> 02:04:05.160]  to live a life we have to get through our days we have to earn a living we have to deal
[02:04:05.160 --> 02:04:10.920]  with our medical problems our children's issues our parents issues making a living paying
[02:04:10.920 --> 02:04:16.680]  taxes going to work and yet there's news out there the news is awesome i don't like to
[02:04:16.680 --> 02:04:20.120]  hear the words it's a slow news day there's never a slow news day in this in this country
[02:04:20.120 --> 02:04:24.280]  under this under this regime you know good for michael savage admitting there's fema
[02:04:24.280 --> 02:04:28.720]  camps good for him to cover stuff like this that's why i like him because none of the
[02:04:28.720 --> 02:04:33.720]  others will even touch it and a lot of times he gives us credit to for our news the covers
[02:04:33.720 --> 02:04:37.840]  on the show if that clips longer there's a longer clip he did later but the point is
[02:04:37.840 --> 02:04:43.600]  is that this is for me this isn't about a radio show this is about saving our future
[02:04:43.600 --> 02:04:51.520]  this is a conscious coordinated creeping authoritarian acclimation that's going on there's no choice

[02:08:38.120 --> 02:08:53.120]  USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA!
[02:08:53.120 --> 02:09:06.120]  That's what the people chanted, at least with the news cameras, showed as half of Boston or more had armored vehicles come in, hundreds of them, and police and military from all over the country,
[02:09:06.120 --> 02:09:23.120]  aiming guns at children, at women. In Los Angeles, the police drove around shooting up multiple vehicles with white women driving cars when the mad cop supposedly was driving a truck and wasn't even the same color.
[02:09:23.120 --> 02:09:41.120]  And it happened over and over again at least three times. Just a crazed mad dog psychology where you get out of your car and have your driver's license in your hand and it flashes so the quickest gun in the west shoots you down and the police always say,
[02:09:41.120 --> 02:09:53.120]  he felt threatened, it's a good kill. I'd start putting on the side of the police cards how many innocent civilians, as you call us, you've killed. So how many Japanese zeros you've shot down?
[02:09:53.120 --> 02:10:02.120]  Maybe how many baby strollers you've run over? Maybe how many old ladies you've shot? Maybe how many people's dogs you've shot when you're in their backyard?
[02:10:02.120 --> 02:10:20.120]  And again, I know most police are not bad people, but the system is turning them into paramilitary. And the feds are funding unconstitutional, it's been thrown out of court, checkpoints on our highways, the army, the marines are involved,
[02:10:20.120 --> 02:10:33.120]  all of this just goes on, the military drills, until we're so conditioned to it and it's also in the TV and the movies to where we accept it. And then you read the Rand Corporation documents I'm about to go over.
[02:10:33.120 --> 02:10:49.120]  And they admit that this is a long term strategic plan to prepare us for the conversion from a once free society with due process and freedom over to a paramilitary third world banana boat republic.
[02:10:49.120 --> 02:11:05.120]  And that's at the heart of why this is happening in our culture. Yesterday, Paul Watson at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com published an article with press releases by FEMA that Drudge Report, the number one aggregating news site in the world,
[02:11:05.120 --> 02:11:19.120]  linked to. And so it went all over the web. It was talked about on different talk shows all over the country yesterday. Should we have Russians in America to keep us safe? And it's all part of the bizarreness.
[02:11:19.120 --> 02:11:33.120]  The globalists talk about how if they can acclimate us with learned helplessness and kind of the psychological warfare tenets of mass Stockholm syndrome, we will basically put up with anything.
[02:11:33.120 --> 02:11:48.120]  And they need to slowly incrementally titrate the dose of globalist poison to where we'll accept pretty much anything. It is normalcy bias is really the best way to to describe it incrementally.
[02:11:48.120 --> 02:12:06.120]  We're globally, you notice the police, the military all basically dress the same now. NATO troops dressed like US troops, Russian troops dressed like NATO troops, and they all do exchange programs with each other, even though on the surface they claim their enemies with one another.
[02:12:06.120 --> 02:12:25.120]  Now, if you go back to the newspapers in the 1960s, you will see the State Department plan 7277 that we're about to show you on screen of your TV viewer for radio listeners just search the term State Department memorandum 7277 or link to our article.
[02:12:25.120 --> 02:12:48.120]  Russian forces provide security at US events, and you'll be able to link through and actually read the PDF of it. And the accompanying New York Times graphic from the 1960s that showed US helmets getting smaller, less US troops, Russian helmets getting smaller, less Russian troops,
[02:12:48.120 --> 02:13:00.120]  while the peacekeeping machinery of general and complete disarmament of every nation state except the UN and its army NATO.
[02:13:00.120 --> 02:13:07.120]  Now fast forward to today and look at how last year and this year in three separate hearings that we've covered.
[02:13:07.120 --> 02:13:24.120]  The Joint Chiefs of Staff sit there and tell the Congress, you don't control the power of the purse under the Constitution anymore, we get our orders from NATO and the President got military authorization for Libya and now Syria from NATO.
[02:13:24.120 --> 02:13:35.120]  Now NATO was created by the Bilderberg group. NATO was created by the CIA, which again is a robber baron controlled group. So let me in layman's terms explain what's happening here.
[02:13:35.120 --> 02:13:49.120]  You have the wealth of Europe, the wealth of the West, parlayed by robber barons in around 1900 in a Rockefeller Rothschild meeting, meetings they had in London and New York. These are all on record.
[02:13:49.120 --> 02:14:07.120]  Let's look them up for the Cecil Rhodes group as the front man for the Rothschilds. This is all on record. Look this up. They wrote books about it. I had guests in last week naming the books to establish a corporate global government on the lines of the British East India
[02:14:07.120 --> 02:14:17.120]  company that had run more than 15 nations at one time. The British found that British government, if they put up their flag, they couldn't run India.
[02:14:17.120 --> 02:14:37.120]  But if they just called it a corporation, they could. For hundreds of years, a private Dutch British German company, the British Dutch East India company, they merged at one point, ran most the ships, ran its own military, commanded British military, and would go in and take over all of India.
[02:14:37.120 --> 02:14:49.120]  They only got problems when they got so arrogant as to run the Jolly Roger, I mean the Union Jack. That's a joke. They call that the real pirate flag worldwide. That is free people running from it.
[02:14:49.120 --> 02:14:59.120]  They would run that sucker up and people would resist it. So Rhodes and others, this is why they set up the Council on Foreign Relations in 22 at Proudhouse, New York. Read that. That's on record.
[02:14:59.120 --> 02:15:11.120]  Shad, we're going to have a corporate global government on the lines of the British Empire. But we're going to get rid of the wealth of England because people look at the wealth of the average Britisher.
[02:15:11.120 --> 02:15:23.120]  Back then, you joined the empire. You actually got something out of it. It really did benefit England to a great extent. Sure, they paid millions of dead soldiers in the war, millions over the hundred years or so of its peak.
[02:15:23.120 --> 02:15:37.120]  They paid in taxes, but they could also get a piece of the booty, a piece of the loot. I know the popular meaning of booty means a woman's rear end or derriere, but it means pirate loot booty.
[02:15:37.120 --> 02:15:48.120]  Continuing, ladies and gentlemen, the problem is this is such a giant area of history. It was the British East India Company that took down China with a fake drug war.
[02:15:48.120 --> 02:15:58.120]  They lobbied China to make opium illegal. Then they brought in the illegal opium and bought off the police over again about 100 years and finally broke the country up in 10 and then 12 parts.
[02:15:58.120 --> 02:16:07.120]  So you have to understand, there's a global corporate government. It isn't about to be set up. It's existed.
[02:16:07.120 --> 02:16:13.120]  What is the British East India Company? It's about 400 years old. Look up the founding of the British East India Company for me. It's about 400 years old.
[02:16:13.120 --> 02:16:24.120]  The Dutch East India Company is about 400 as well. The point is this model, and they even write books about it. This is not my opinion. The globalists do. This is their global government.
[02:16:24.120 --> 02:16:37.120]  The British East India Company didn't pay taxes. The British East India Company was above the law. The British East India Company could take private ships, basically, if anybody they wanted, even when there wasn't a war going on.
[02:16:37.120 --> 02:16:47.120]  The British East India Company commanded British warships. The British East India Company was the guys that invented modern false flagging.
[02:16:47.120 --> 02:17:00.120]  On and on and on. Stage terror attacks against their own interest. And so the model of the British East India Company, my memory served. It was formed in 1612.
[02:17:00.120 --> 02:17:07.120]  So that make it 400 years old, exactly. All right, continuing here. I don't do that on purpose on there. I do that to test my own memory.
[02:17:07.120 --> 02:17:22.120]  This is the model. The new order ain't coming, Jack. The new order's here. It went and grabbed the resources of the world. It beat the Spanish. It beat the Portuguese. It ran out the Germans. It ran out the French.
[02:17:22.120 --> 02:17:32.120]  It won, okay? The British Empire. It ran everybody out. The Portuguese and Spanish had a lot more than they did just 200 years ago.
[02:17:32.120 --> 02:17:40.120]  Okay, nobody could beat this model. This is the model. Using freebooters, using letter of mark, you name it.
[02:17:40.120 --> 02:17:57.120]  And so when you read about Russian troops training to take on, quote, U.S. extremist in Colorado drills last year, when you read about Russian troops to be at sporting events, and it's going to be on the news, Russian troops, just to acclimate you.
[02:17:57.120 --> 02:18:07.120]  If you'll put up with the old enemy, the Ruskies here, you'll put up with your own cops doing it. You'll put up with your own military. It doesn't matter if they're Rusky.
[02:18:07.120 --> 02:18:14.120]  It doesn't matter if they're Japanese. It doesn't matter if they're Dutch. It doesn't matter if they're Israeli. It doesn't matter if they're German, French, any of it.
[02:18:14.120 --> 02:18:18.120]  They've all been here. I've been to the drills. I've videotaped it.
[02:18:18.120 --> 02:18:29.120]  It's all treason against humanity. Your police have been militarized. Your police on record by the Rand Corporation the last 60 years have been transformed into paramilitary soldiers.
[02:18:29.120 --> 02:18:39.120]  They now admit in the news that police are now running anti-insurgent operations in the U.S. That's what it is. You've been labeled the enemy.
[02:18:39.120 --> 02:18:45.120]  So your wife gets out with a driver's license. Looks like a gun. They kill her. They're training you to go, good job, officer.
[02:18:45.120 --> 02:18:54.120]  You felt threatened where they can just kill us whenever they want. Pull Alex Jones over. Boom. Shoot me in the head. Say I had a pen in my hand.
[02:18:54.120 --> 02:19:01.120]  They're now executing people publicly. They're acclimating the cops, the military, the people, everybody.
[02:19:01.120 --> 02:19:08.120]  We're going to go to break and I'm going to come back and break all this down no matter how long it takes and go over these exhibits here.
[02:19:08.120 --> 02:19:21.120]  But I remember when I first got on air 18 years ago getting calls going, I was in a Missouri national park or state park or in a Michigan or in Maryland.
[02:19:21.120 --> 02:19:30.120]  It was always the same story and Russian troops came over and searched our bags and I thought these people are insane until I was sent photos.
[02:19:30.120 --> 02:19:40.120]  And then I went. I would get calls. I said, oh, next time you see the shoe call me. So I'd get on an airplane. I'd go there and the government was already listening.
[02:19:40.120 --> 02:19:49.120]  They'd break in our hotel rooms. They'd sabotage our rent car and I would get there and there would be Russian troops and Israelis and everything.
[02:19:49.120 --> 02:19:57.120]  They would get that footage of it and then they would set fires and try to blame me. I mean, folks, this is a giant covert off.
[02:19:57.120 --> 02:20:01.120]  I'm going to tell you about it when we come back.
[02:20:01.120 --> 02:20:09.120]  Hi, my name is Annette and due to menopause symptoms for nearly two years, I suffered severe hot flashes which prevented me from sleeping all night.
[02:20:09.120 --> 02:20:14.120]  It was so hard to work because I continued all day to have the hot flashes from hell.
[02:20:14.120 --> 02:20:22.120]  I was exhausted and depleted. After only three weeks on one roadway, I have no hot flashes and I'm sleeping normally again.
[02:20:22.120 --> 02:20:26.120]  I feel energized and strong. This is an amazing product.
[02:20:26.120 --> 02:20:32.120]  It is a little known fact that every single cell of your body is supposed to produce 10% of its protein content as glutathione.
[02:20:32.120 --> 02:20:39.120]  But due to toxicity and aging, it does not. Could glutathione be a missing factor in optimal cell function for your entire body?
[02:20:39.120 --> 02:20:46.120]  If you restore the optimal glutathione levels in your cells, especially your glands and organs, then as a result, your glands and organs work better.
[02:20:46.120 --> 02:20:49.120]  Imagine the quality of life improvement you might have.

[02:21:41.120 --> 02:21:51.120]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[02:21:51.120 --> 02:22:01.120]  The war is here. It's an info war. The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[02:22:01.120 --> 02:22:06.120]  Summer is here and nothing looks better than tanned skin and white teeth.

[02:23:09.120 --> 02:23:17.120]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth. According to the World Gold Council in the U.S. Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[02:23:17.120 --> 02:23:25.120]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.

[02:24:00.120 --> 02:24:17.120]  All right, Alex Jones here back live on this Tuesday live edition. By the way, every week now we're getting contacted by really iconic people and one of the most iconic people I could think of living.
[02:24:17.120 --> 02:24:31.120]  We've gotten in touch with they've gotten in touch with us because of the system doing something anti-liberty to them. Talk about a living legend.
[02:24:31.120 --> 02:24:38.120]  You know, the good news is everybody that knows what's going on needs to speak out now, just like I said last week, and I guess that's starting to happen.
[02:24:38.120 --> 02:24:47.120]  We better continue to check all our Facebooks and emails and everything because the kind of messages that are coming in here, guys.
[02:24:47.120 --> 02:24:59.120]  We need all these iconic people who've got the right stuff to go public and speak out against the New World Order, and it needs to be done right now.
[02:24:59.120 --> 02:25:11.120]  Because I'm telling you, folks, all the John Burt society gets is demonized from the 50s and 60s saying there's a plan to bring in foreign troops in America incrementally getting us used to globalism.
[02:25:11.120 --> 02:25:19.120]  They knew because they had a lot of military officers who weren't traders of this country who were involved in classified briefings about this plan.
[02:25:19.120 --> 02:25:27.120]  And then in the 60s, they tried to float the plan when they thought America totally trusted the government to put you in troops in America.
[02:25:27.120 --> 02:25:34.120]  That's why you always hear the good old boys going, I see blue helmets, I start shooting.
[02:25:34.120 --> 02:25:43.120]  Because it's a real plan, and we've held it back. This is a big New Brzezinski admits they're at least a decade behind.
[02:25:43.120 --> 02:25:55.120]  But now they're trying to catch up. Every video game, every sitcom, every movie that's got cops in it, the militias, our child molesters are blowing things up, and George Washington's a pig.
[02:25:55.120 --> 02:26:03.120]  I mean, come on, man, that's the bad guys. You'd expect if the Russians would have took over in the 70s, that's what they'd have on TV.
[02:26:03.120 --> 02:26:11.120]  You know, once they took over, America is bad. Founding fathers are bad. Your guns are bad. The family is bad. The conservatives are bad.
[02:26:11.120 --> 02:26:21.120]  I mean, on and on and on and on. Al-Qaeda is not the threat. It is the American people. It's game over.
[02:26:21.120 --> 02:26:33.120]  So going over these articles, Russian forces to provide security at U.S. events under NLE09 via FEMA, and I'll show you that coming up in the next segment.
[02:26:33.120 --> 02:26:41.120]  Did you guys print NLE09? FEMA NLE09, I'll do it, I'll have a three minute break, I can get it during the next break.
[02:26:41.120 --> 02:26:54.120]  I mean, is Russian forces to provide security at U.S. events? And then it goes on to say they're going to have their security here advising the TSA and advising others.
[02:26:54.120 --> 02:27:00.120]  And now they're announcing they're going to start arming the TSA. They've already armed some. That article's up on infowars.com.
[02:27:00.120 --> 02:27:17.120]  All this is is global megabanks that are above the United States and above Russia and above China, and they make these deals where they control the unlimited trillions of dollars because they got all the governments to accept private,
[02:27:17.120 --> 02:27:37.120]  federal reserves, EU central banks, UK central bank, Russian central bank. There's less than maybe 15 or so countries, most of them backwaters that don't have a globalist run central bank where one dollar that you deposit can be loaned out as 10.
[02:27:37.120 --> 02:27:49.120]  Well, that gives those megabanks the power to take over the world. They have that power. Now they get trillions at 0% interest, and then loaned out to us at 10, 20, 30% or 40.
[02:27:49.120 --> 02:27:59.120]  Or in some cases, they just get trillions, hundreds of billions per company and straight bailouts. They get the corporate welfare. They get the NSA spiger to spy on people.
[02:27:59.120 --> 02:28:14.120]  And so it's not just Russians here. It's Americans over there. And it's Latin American troops practicing landing in Florida and it's US troops practicing landing in the Latin American countries.
[02:28:14.120 --> 02:28:31.120]  And in LE09, 15 troop groups and security forces from 15 listed nations on FEMA's website here to, quote, train to take on domestic extremist.
[02:28:31.120 --> 02:28:39.120]  So that's what it is. The globalists set up a world government. They start all these global forms of taxes. That's what these direct bailouts and the banks are and bail ins.
[02:28:39.120 --> 02:28:52.120]  They go and grab money out of your private bank accounts, send it to private individuals. Who's getting it's even secret. And then there's just NATO forces just land or are invited in by your country as what they call a stabilization force.
[02:28:52.120 --> 02:29:02.120]  We're going to go to break in a long segment. I'm going to show you all these documents of your TV viewer. Radio listeners can just write down what I'm saying and look it up for themselves.
[02:29:02.120 --> 02:29:11.120]  And then again the globalists control the media, the dominant media, so they implode the countries, poses the saviors and then are invited in.
[02:29:11.120 --> 02:29:18.120]  EU stabilization force brought into Greece. EU stabilization force brought into Spain. EU stabilization forces.
[02:29:18.120 --> 02:29:25.120]  UN stabilization forces brought into Latin America to help carry out the environmental law, exterminating people.
[02:29:25.120 --> 02:29:33.120]  It's Africa. It's global peacekeepers who are the only ones that are going to be able to have the guns. In the future our military will have no weapons.
[02:29:33.120 --> 02:29:41.120]  They'll still be U.S. units. But they'll be, and this is already happening, commanded under the UN NATO.
[02:29:41.120 --> 02:29:50.120]  It's self created by the Rockefellers and Rothschilds on record. Look who created it. 1945 at a U.S. Naval base in San Francisco, Presidio.
[02:29:50.120 --> 02:30:01.120]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.120 --> 02:30:13.120]  There is an increased need to support our immunity and health. At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing a full selection of silver based products.

[02:31:01.120 --> 02:31:10.120]  Are we choosing our own destiny or has it been pre-selected for us? As we've moved through history, every great leader has had to understand the potential of information.
[02:31:10.120 --> 02:31:18.120]  Billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche.
[02:31:18.120 --> 02:31:27.120]  From compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[02:31:27.120 --> 02:31:34.120]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying it, they can take total control of your awareness.
[02:31:34.120 --> 02:31:37.120]  All of this is happening so fast, you need to be ahead of the game.
[02:31:37.120 --> 02:31:44.120]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse but demand a war.
[02:31:44.120 --> 02:31:58.120]  Out of another one, another plane to stay.
[02:32:14.120 --> 02:32:25.120]  Viruses and mold that cause disease. This helps to reduce the workload of your already overworked immune system and allows the immune system to refocus its energy and recharge.
[02:32:25.120 --> 02:32:35.120]  Supernatural silver can help combat over 300 different conditions and it has the ability to kill over 143 types of bacteria, viruses, mold and yeast.

[02:33:04.120 --> 02:33:09.120]  We are on the march. The empire is on the run.
[02:33:09.120 --> 02:33:27.120]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:27.120 --> 02:33:34.120]  I'm looking for a few good men and women of every race, color, creed, religion who want basic freedom.
[02:33:34.120 --> 02:33:41.120]  You want to build a right to constitution, you want to be able to stand on your own two feet and be treated like a human being and you want freedom.
[02:33:41.120 --> 02:33:46.120]  You want to be a slave then sign up with the New World Order because I studied history, I studied current regimes.
[02:33:46.120 --> 02:34:02.120]  There ain't nothing and I mean there ain't nothing worse than the New World Order. Nothing nastier, nothing smarter, nothing more vicious, more murderous, more committed than the globalist.
[02:34:02.120 --> 02:34:12.120]  And if the general public could just wrap their brains around this, why do you think they're in the news now saying Russian troops are going to be in America?
[02:34:12.120 --> 02:34:24.120]  They always did these drills before and then if we tried to cover it and even add video, they'd have their talking heads and bots come out and say we were crazy.
[02:34:24.120 --> 02:34:29.120]  They call them their megaphones, their sock puppets, fake online profiles.
[02:34:29.120 --> 02:34:40.120]  They'll have them in this post and we put this on YouTube later tomorrow saying none of this exist or that it's no big deal because they're there to just acclimate you.
[02:34:40.120 --> 02:34:51.120]  Okay, yeah, they have Russian troops. See, first it's TSA in the airport, then they're on the street, then they're at the football game and then now it's TSA everywhere and all over the country.
[02:34:51.120 --> 02:34:56.120]  You film police, they walk over and go, why are you filming me? I'm just documenting what you're doing.
[02:34:56.120 --> 02:35:04.120]  Put your hands behind your back, they put you in handcuffs, slam your head in the concrete, your dog jumps out of the car, they shoot it.
[02:35:04.120 --> 02:35:18.120]  It's because you are an enemy soldier and basic military training is an enemy soldier gives you a lip, kick them in the head, cover up murders, cover up corruption.
[02:35:18.120 --> 02:35:26.120]  We are called civilians. Your mayors call you civilians. Your police chiefs call you civilians. They're civilians too, but not really.
[02:35:26.120 --> 02:35:32.120]  They'll tell you, we're a paramilitary force. You are civilians because we are under a military occupation.
[02:35:32.120 --> 02:35:36.120]  Now, the good news is this is waking up the police. This is an incredible takeover.
[02:35:36.120 --> 02:35:43.120]  So a lot of police are going, yeah, this is going on and a lot of military, especially they're really waking up.
[02:35:43.120 --> 02:35:56.120]  So it's our job to reach out to police and military and because the globalists plan to have the police abuse us to then make us get angry and make us act as a hostile force to play into that psychology.
[02:35:56.120 --> 02:36:02.120]  Instead of going over to these guys and going, do you understand what's happening? Do you want the big picture?
[02:36:02.120 --> 02:36:11.120]  And you pull back with police and military and show them like I'm doing right now. There's a reason half the military was 40% is six months ago.
[02:36:11.120 --> 02:36:20.120]  Half the military I walk up to and then I talk to them are listeners and then they'll tell me either 90% of their union unit or 30%.
[02:36:20.120 --> 02:36:28.120]  But it's always about half are awake and know what's going on and are upset and listen to the show. Why? Because I talk about things they know are true.
[02:36:28.120 --> 02:36:36.120]  I talk about things that they've been part of and didn't understand. They know when they hear this show. I know what I'm talking about.
[02:36:36.120 --> 02:36:44.120]  Because I am a veteran of defending the Republic for 18 years on air, 20, it'll be 21 years in a few months.
[02:36:44.120 --> 02:36:52.120]  Folks, I used to hear about there were black helicopters in our town. They blew up the old police station and threatened to kill us if we talked about it.
[02:36:52.120 --> 02:36:58.120]  And I'd go down there to be a burnout building and cops asking, you're not supposed to ask questions. I'm like, you mean this is real?
[02:36:58.120 --> 02:37:06.120]  I'd be told, oh yeah, they got foreign troops. They're going to practice rounding people up in the town. So I'd go to the events. I'd shoot video of it.
[02:37:06.120 --> 02:37:12.120]  And have Marines walk over with machine guns and say, turn your camera off.
[02:37:12.120 --> 02:37:18.120]  I'd witness them with troops from seven different nations in Oakland, trains for gun confiscation.
[02:37:18.120 --> 02:37:28.120]  And admit it was for America. On video, police state 2000, police state to the takeover, police state three total enslavement, police state four, the rise of FEMA.
[02:37:28.120 --> 02:37:36.120]  I mean, you think this is all just an exercise in baloney? We have the video.
[02:37:36.120 --> 02:37:42.120]  And then I was told they were going to have foreign trips, but really it turned out it was probably drug smuggling the way they acted.
[02:37:42.120 --> 02:37:51.120]  I get to Brooksville, Florida. I got to get Mike Hansen back in here. Guy Raymond Teague's worked me for two years. He worked off on his volunteer before that.
[02:37:51.120 --> 02:37:57.120]  I did between a better engineering job when they had a bunch of layoffs. He worked for me. Really smart guy.
[02:37:57.120 --> 02:38:08.120]  I need to get Mike Hansen in here who was with me in Florida in the woods trying to cover military drills.
[02:38:08.120 --> 02:38:15.120]  When they had a guy jump out of the bushes, it was where them set fires. I had to start putting out and then had to jump on the guy to stop him.
[02:38:15.120 --> 02:38:23.120]  I mean, only, I mean, they were going to burn down Brooksville, Florida and blame it on me.
[02:38:23.120 --> 02:38:30.120]  The day before they got there, we got footage of this. I'm walking down the street. People come and go, you're Alex Jones. This is a good size town.
[02:38:30.120 --> 02:38:35.120]  We're not supposed to talk to you. The army came to our door.
[02:38:35.120 --> 02:38:48.120]  And I later learned when Marines visited me, popped in the VHS tape that was a screen capture, I guess, off of the digital of myself a year before
[02:38:48.120 --> 02:38:56.120]  at Operation Urban Warrior in Oakland, California. And they had a drone over me called Death Star. That was its code name.
[02:38:56.120 --> 02:39:05.120]  And they had drones using us, gassing our car up, leaving the hotel, going to cover it. They used us as part of the simulation.
[02:39:05.120 --> 02:39:12.120]  When you go protest one of these things or you go cover it, it's a simulation when they break in your hotel room.
[02:39:12.120 --> 02:39:19.120]  It's a simulation when they set a fire and say, why are you setting in a fire as they light the grass on fire?
[02:39:19.120 --> 02:39:28.120]  I mean, this is so sick. This is so sick. And of course, these Marines weren't supposed to be showing me this.
[02:39:28.120 --> 02:39:35.120]  They weren't there to threaten me. They said, hey, we all got upset about this too. And they showed it to me because they knew some family I knew that I'm going to leave it at that.
[02:39:35.120 --> 02:39:44.120]  And I said, let me show this. And they said, nope, we'd get arrested for this. And they said goodbye and left. And Mike Hanson was sitting there going...
[02:39:44.120 --> 02:39:54.120]  And they're like, Death Star, Death Star, we're over the targets. I mean, they had drones on me in 1999. I'm just Alex Jones, man.
[02:39:54.120 --> 02:40:01.120]  They're trying to take my guns. I want to show you. But they can't let me show you that because you might wake up.
[02:40:01.120 --> 02:40:10.120]  Now they got Russians here. Folks, they've had Russians here for 20 stinking years that I know of.
[02:40:10.120 --> 02:40:18.120]  I remember getting calls from England going, they've got foreign troops, including Russians, in Scotland searching our houses.
[02:40:18.120 --> 02:40:23.120]  And I didn't believe it. And then it came out in the BBC a year later because the people basically rioted.
[02:40:23.120 --> 02:40:32.120]  They had Russian and Ukrainian troops or supposedly old enemies ransacking people's vehicles at highway checkpoints in Scotland.
[02:40:32.120 --> 02:40:38.120]  Look it up. As a psych warfare test to see what they would do.
[02:40:38.120 --> 02:40:44.120]  I can't tell you, folks, how many people are in some remote area of the woods and foreign troops come over.
[02:40:44.120 --> 02:40:54.120]  And in some cases they kill Americans just to see if they can get away with it.
[02:40:54.120 --> 02:41:06.120]  And so that's what I'm getting at here is that they're now telling you about the Russians in anti extremist training last year and earlier this year in Colorado.
[02:41:06.120 --> 02:41:14.120]  You know, first it's, oh, they're inspecting our missiles and then they're inspecting our helicopters and then, oh, they're inspecting our national security system.
[02:41:14.120 --> 02:41:21.120]  And then they're doing, and I'm not saying the Russians are the enemy. The globalists have all the money. They're above all the countries.
[02:41:21.120 --> 02:41:31.120]  They've got their operatives in almost everywhere and they order the ministries to do these things and do exchange programs to where we'll put up with anything.
[02:41:31.120 --> 02:41:37.120]  Just like last year, or no, it's two years ago now, the Winter Olympics in Canada.
[02:41:37.120 --> 02:41:48.120]  It was in all their papers that, oh, look, the Yanks are here helping run checkpoints and run security in the towns outside the Olympics.
[02:41:48.120 --> 02:41:51.120]  Because Canadians have always been wary of a U.S. takeover.
[02:41:51.120 --> 02:41:59.120]  So if they'll put up with Americans doing it and vice versa, folks, this is all public is what's so frustrating.
[02:41:59.120 --> 02:42:01.120]  Now, let's go over some of these news articles here.
[02:42:01.120 --> 02:42:08.120]  Russia forces, Russian forces to provide security at U.S. events.
[02:42:08.120 --> 02:42:17.120]  FEMA signs deal with Russian emergency situations ministry to exchange experts to oversee security events like football games, baseball games, city events.
[02:42:17.120 --> 02:42:24.120]  That's why I can't go to any major city event now, open air and not have regular Army, National Guard, State Guard.
[02:42:24.120 --> 02:42:35.120]  They're searching people. I can't go on Lake Austin without watching every boat be pulled over and every kayaker pulled over and harassed.
[02:42:35.120 --> 02:42:37.120]  But I got up and stood there with the same body language.
[02:42:37.120 --> 02:42:45.120]  I mean, these cops yesterday were just, were just like, just like, like if I was trying to intimidate somebody or like if I was about to get in the fight with somebody, I'd act like this.
[02:42:45.120 --> 02:42:48.120]  I mean, just like when you're just bugging their eyes out at you.
[02:42:48.120 --> 02:42:55.120]  So when they pulled up behind us, I just stood up, started filming them. I couldn't wait to educate them.
[02:42:55.120 --> 02:42:57.120]  I couldn't wait because they won't listen now.
[02:42:57.120 --> 02:42:59.120]  But when they're dying of cancer in five years, they will.
[02:42:59.120 --> 02:43:08.120]  I was talking about the vaccines and things and how pathetic and how in this system, how am I automatically a suspect when they have no evidence to pull us over?
[02:43:08.120 --> 02:43:14.120]  Everything, you know, blah, blah, blah, how, how this is a violation of the Fourth Amendment, how they've been told that waterways are a privilege.
[02:43:14.120 --> 02:43:16.120]  They're not Supreme Court rulings.
[02:43:16.120 --> 02:43:18.120]  I was going to educate them.
[02:43:18.120 --> 02:43:23.120]  Well, why when I was a kid, did you not stick your chest out and pull over every boat and bug your eyes out?
[02:43:23.120 --> 02:43:33.120]  The truth is you've been given paramilitary training like this is a Fallujah checkpoint and that you're in deadly danger of me when the truth is I'm in danger of you and a tyrannical government.
[02:43:33.120 --> 02:43:39.120]  And that's George Washington talking there, buddy.
[02:43:39.120 --> 02:43:43.120]  The truth is, are we going to celebrate on the Fourth of July this tyranny?
[02:43:43.120 --> 02:43:45.120]  I'm not going to celebrate it.
[02:43:45.120 --> 02:43:47.120]  How about we mourn?
[02:43:47.120 --> 02:43:48.120]  How about we cry?
[02:43:48.120 --> 02:43:53.120]  How about we go to the back of a church for six hours and meditate on what we become?
[02:43:53.120 --> 02:44:04.120]  So to going out and, you know, going through some checkpoints and celebrating some fireworks they're trying to ban for the citizens to have because we can't be trusted to have them.
[02:44:04.120 --> 02:44:09.120]  This is a global corporate total takeover where they're acclimating everyone.
[02:44:09.120 --> 02:44:15.120]  They're taking all our deep water ports in the Pacific and in the Atlantic to the Communist Chinese.
[02:44:15.120 --> 02:44:18.120]  Give them the Panama Canal.
[02:44:18.120 --> 02:44:22.120]  Let Chinese Communist front companies have 6,000 companies in the U.S.
[02:44:22.120 --> 02:44:26.120]  Pay 21 million dollars of tax money to move the major new plants.
[02:44:26.120 --> 02:44:28.120]  They didn't just build them there.
[02:44:28.120 --> 02:44:31.120]  They will, you paid to move them there.
[02:44:31.120 --> 02:44:37.120]  Militarily, they're shutting off all our major power plants, shipping our jobs, paying to ship them.
[02:44:37.120 --> 02:44:39.120]  It's like we can't take your General Motors plants.
[02:44:39.120 --> 02:44:44.120]  We'll pay you 21 billion, the cost of all the plants and workers for five years.
[02:44:44.120 --> 02:44:46.120]  And we can then sell those to America.
[02:44:46.120 --> 02:44:48.120]  You bet your boots.
[02:44:48.120 --> 02:44:49.120]  We haven't got the robots ready.
[02:44:49.120 --> 02:44:58.120]  We want your slaves because they can leverage out all their factories in America.
[02:44:58.120 --> 02:45:00.120]  Study military warfare.
[02:45:00.120 --> 02:45:01.120]  You blow up their infrastructure.
[02:45:01.120 --> 02:45:03.120]  You blow up their manufacturing.
[02:45:03.120 --> 02:45:04.120]  You blow up their power plants.
[02:45:04.120 --> 02:45:05.120]  You bomb them.
[02:45:05.120 --> 02:45:06.120]  Our government is doing that right now.
[02:45:06.120 --> 02:45:08.120]  It's bombing everything politically.
[02:45:08.120 --> 02:45:14.120]  Everything's being ripped out, shoved into the ocean.
[02:45:14.120 --> 02:45:18.120]  Obama's telling people, it's not good to have a nice house or a nice car.
[02:45:18.120 --> 02:45:19.120]  That hurts the earth.
[02:45:19.120 --> 02:45:24.120]  Getting you ready to think it's sexy to be poor.
[02:45:24.120 --> 02:45:27.120]  This is a radical transformation we're now entering.
[02:45:27.120 --> 02:45:28.120]  I want to go over more of these articles.
[02:45:28.120 --> 02:45:29.120]  Let me show you what this really is.
[02:45:29.120 --> 02:45:35.120]  Here's State Department memorandum 7277, public law, freedom from war.
[02:45:35.120 --> 02:45:40.120]  How the U.S. will incrementally lose its entire military along with the Russians.
[02:45:40.120 --> 02:45:42.120]  The exchange programs, everything.
[02:45:42.120 --> 02:45:43.120]  And I've got the full binder.
[02:45:43.120 --> 02:45:45.120]  It's that thick going over all this.
[02:45:45.120 --> 02:45:48.120]  I've shown it to you before here on air.
[02:45:48.120 --> 02:45:53.120]  And then you find in the news articles, oh, Russian police come over to learn how to American policing.
[02:45:53.120 --> 02:45:59.120]  And then our police are sent to them back and forth to where everybody's comfortable with having foreign troops here.
[02:45:59.120 --> 02:46:04.120]  Because if you'll put up with that, you'll surely put up with your own so-called police setting up a checkpoint.
[02:46:04.120 --> 02:46:06.120]  When it's all illegal.
[02:46:06.120 --> 02:46:07.120]  Supreme Court rules.
[02:46:07.120 --> 02:46:12.120]  They can't set up checkpoints to see who exit the highway and then use that as fourth amendment to search your car.
[02:46:12.120 --> 02:46:16.120]  So they call them April fools jokes and go, there was no checkpoint up ahead.
[02:46:16.120 --> 02:46:25.120]  Or they have you dropped a checkpoint and say, we're here to take blood and most people just give the blood.
[02:46:25.120 --> 02:46:27.120]  State Department memorandum 7277.
[02:46:27.120 --> 02:46:31.120]  Let's put up the helmet graphic on TV for folks.
[02:46:31.120 --> 02:46:32.120]  Go read this.
[02:46:32.120 --> 02:46:33.120]  This has been the plan.
[02:46:33.120 --> 02:46:37.120]  This is why this is why everybody warns you about this.
[02:46:37.120 --> 02:46:39.120]  Why is there freedom from war?
[02:46:39.120 --> 02:46:45.120]  Because only the UN is going to have the weapons and who set it up private corporations.
[02:46:45.120 --> 02:46:55.120]  And then again, the UN is above the law with diplomatic community run by the big billionaires that control trillions who are exempt from taxes and above the law with diplomatic community.
[02:46:55.120 --> 02:46:57.120]  Google has diplomatic community.
[02:46:57.120 --> 02:46:59.120]  Goldman Sachs has diplomatic community.
[02:46:59.120 --> 02:47:03.120]  British Petroleum has diplomatic community and they fund the Bilderberg group on record.
[02:47:03.120 --> 02:47:07.120]  They're allowed to steal all your data because they are the NSA.
[02:47:07.120 --> 02:47:12.120]  But they've got a new movie out called interns where they're friendly.
[02:47:12.120 --> 02:47:14.120]  That's military propaganda.
[02:47:14.120 --> 02:47:21.120]  We're working on a story where hundreds of millions are being given to directors covertly for huge propaganda purposes.
[02:47:21.120 --> 02:47:28.120]  I mean, folks, if you knew the things we knew that I'm not even really ready to break to you yet, it is a full on takeover.
[02:47:28.120 --> 02:47:31.120]  It is by the grace of God, I'm even alive right now.
[02:47:31.120 --> 02:47:33.120]  Okay, pray for us.
[02:47:33.120 --> 02:47:35.120]  Spread the word about this broadcast.
[02:47:35.120 --> 02:47:37.120]  Let me show you the really key document.
[02:47:37.120 --> 02:47:38.120]  Let's go to the next one.
[02:47:38.120 --> 02:47:45.120]  O'Royal Center, Rand Corporation.
[02:47:45.120 --> 02:47:49.120]  This is the stability police force for the United States.
[02:47:49.120 --> 02:47:52.120]  It describes UN occupation forces.
[02:47:52.120 --> 02:47:54.120]  This is 200 plus pages long.
[02:47:54.120 --> 02:47:57.120]  I suggest you go read it.
[02:47:57.120 --> 02:48:10.120]  They are advised by the former head of national security for the Pentagon, General Jones, and all these other top names.
[02:48:10.120 --> 02:48:11.120]  Read it.
[02:48:11.120 --> 02:48:13.120]  And I read similar documents.
[02:48:13.120 --> 02:48:16.120]  This is just an update of what's been around since the late 1990s when I first read all this.
[02:48:16.120 --> 02:48:24.120]  And that's why I knew everything because it's admitted justification and options for creating U.S. capabilities for stability police force.
[02:48:24.120 --> 02:48:26.120]  This is 7277.
[02:48:26.120 --> 02:48:32.120]  This is the freedom for war multinational corporate U.S. Army Corps.
[02:48:32.120 --> 02:48:34.120]  That's at the center of it.
[02:48:34.120 --> 02:48:36.120]  Stability international force.
[02:48:36.120 --> 02:48:42.120]  And it says modeled after the UN occupations and it lists Serbia, Herzegovina.
[02:48:42.120 --> 02:48:44.120]  It lists areas of Africa.
[02:48:44.120 --> 02:48:45.120]  It lists the Middle East.
[02:48:45.120 --> 02:48:46.120]  It lists this.
[02:48:46.120 --> 02:48:53.120]  Right now U.S. troops, this plan is going into full bore, have been sent to northern Israel and southern Israel.
[02:48:53.120 --> 02:48:57.120]  U.S. troops have now landed in Jordan and are refusing to leave.
[02:48:57.120 --> 02:48:59.120]  And it's not even in our news.
[02:48:59.120 --> 02:49:00.120]  It's in Reuters.
[02:49:00.120 --> 02:49:01.120]  So-called U.S. forces.
[02:49:01.120 --> 02:49:02.120]  They're not.
[02:49:02.120 --> 02:49:06.120]  This is under NATO orders and UN orders.
[02:49:06.120 --> 02:49:08.120]  This is the world government force.
[02:49:08.120 --> 02:49:10.120]  You'll still have the military.
[02:49:10.120 --> 02:49:14.120]  You'll still have an American patch, but you'll be under UN command.
[02:49:14.120 --> 02:49:15.120]  That's the plan.
[02:49:15.120 --> 02:49:16.120]  Boom.
[02:49:16.120 --> 02:49:17.120]  Bada-bing.
[02:49:17.120 --> 02:49:18.120]  It's done.
[02:49:18.120 --> 02:49:21.120]  Go read the stability police force United States.
[02:49:21.120 --> 02:49:22.120]  Go read it.
[02:49:22.120 --> 02:49:24.120]  We just printed out the summary today.
[02:49:24.120 --> 02:49:28.120]  Around the office we printed the whole 200 plus page baby about a month ago and I went through it.
[02:49:28.120 --> 02:49:35.120]  And it describes off the UN military occupation of a country model how to do that for the U.S.
[02:49:35.120 --> 02:49:39.120]  And again, they've been saying since the 90s we're going to collapse the U.S.
[02:49:39.120 --> 02:49:40.120]  We're going to federalize the police.
[02:49:40.120 --> 02:49:41.120]  Here's how they'll be federalized.
[02:49:41.120 --> 02:49:43.120]  We're going to set the threat fusion centers.
[02:49:43.120 --> 02:49:45.120]  We're going to make it free to core.
[02:49:45.120 --> 02:49:49.120]  We're only the elite police are part of the special events team.
[02:49:49.120 --> 02:49:51.120]  Then we'll expand that where all the other cops want to be part of it.
[02:49:51.120 --> 02:49:54.120]  They'll be given a supplemental federal paycheck.
[02:49:54.120 --> 02:49:58.120]  Then that will be swung under UN control via FEMA.
[02:49:58.120 --> 02:50:06.120]  And now FEMA says we're under the UN with the Russians and the Russians are coming here to run security at events.
[02:50:06.120 --> 02:50:08.120]  And they're going to have Russians on the news.
[02:50:08.120 --> 02:50:11.120]  Well, I guess I'm glad the Russians are here to search my bag.
[02:50:11.120 --> 02:50:12.120]  Why not?
[02:50:12.120 --> 02:50:14.120]  You let them stick your hands down your pants.
[02:50:14.120 --> 02:50:17.120]  You let them take your five-year-old away and stick their hands down their pants.
[02:50:17.120 --> 02:50:19.120]  Why wouldn't they hurt you?
[02:50:19.120 --> 02:50:25.120]  I listen to the childlike pathetic weakness of the average American who calls into other talk radio shows,
[02:50:25.120 --> 02:50:26.120]  not my listeners on average.
[02:50:26.120 --> 02:50:31.120]  I watch them who are just into loving the government and trusting the state and,
[02:50:31.120 --> 02:50:32.120]  oh, I take all my shots.
[02:50:32.120 --> 02:50:33.120]  I love the system.
[02:50:33.120 --> 02:50:37.120]  You are the biggest idiots the world's ever seen.
[02:50:37.120 --> 02:50:41.120]  This is a on record total takeover.
[02:50:41.120 --> 02:50:46.120]  And let me tell you, they're getting close to blowing stuff up and blaming it on us and having the whole insurrection and the whole nine yards
[02:50:46.120 --> 02:50:49.120]  if they're already rolling out the Russians, they've been here for 20 years.
[02:50:49.120 --> 02:50:51.120]  Now they're getting you ready for them.
[02:50:51.120 --> 02:50:55.120]  That means they're getting very close to dropping the hammer, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:50:55.120 --> 02:50:58.120]  So now we're right again about foreign trips.
[02:50:58.120 --> 02:51:27.120]  I've got more documents straight ahead.
[02:51:29.120 --> 02:51:35.120]  Until July 10th, buy three of any food item and receive the fourth one free with free shipping.

[02:52:05.120 --> 02:52:08.120]  I want you to know some very important information.
[02:52:08.120 --> 02:52:14.120]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House
[02:52:14.120 --> 02:52:18.120]  at a time when only the president could obtain this world-class healer.
[02:52:18.120 --> 02:52:23.120]  Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.

[02:53:05.120 --> 02:53:08.120]  Dozens of diseases are caused by infectious organisms
[02:53:08.120 --> 02:53:12.120]  and now the emergence of superbugs that are resistant to antibiotics
[02:53:12.120 --> 02:53:15.120]  poses an even bigger threat to our safety.
[02:53:15.120 --> 02:53:19.120]  Don't wait for the medical world to discover a new treatment for the latest superbug.
[02:53:19.120 --> 02:53:24.120]  It's important to realize that a simple, safe and effective alternative already exists.

[02:54:08.120 --> 02:54:15.120]  Alex Jones here back live on this Tuesday edition.
[02:54:15.120 --> 02:54:24.120]  Look, what's going on here is acclimation, is conditioning, is incrementalism.
[02:54:24.120 --> 02:54:29.120]  And the globalists are masters at just slowly bringing in things,
[02:54:29.120 --> 02:54:32.120]  slowly turning the heat up until you're like,
[02:54:32.120 --> 02:54:34.120]  oh yeah, everybody's heard about the Russian troops.
[02:54:34.120 --> 02:54:37.120]  Everybody's heard about the TSA checkpoints on the highways.
[02:54:37.120 --> 02:54:41.120]  Yeah, everybody's heard. Everybody's had the cops pull up to each boat on the lake
[02:54:41.120 --> 02:54:44.120]  and bug their eyes out and act rude.
[02:54:44.120 --> 02:54:46.120]  And we all cower and the cops all see that and think,
[02:54:46.120 --> 02:54:48.120]  watch out, you're out towards people.
[02:54:48.120 --> 02:54:50.120]  You little scum.
[02:54:50.120 --> 02:54:53.120]  This is all so they can take our bank accounts, shut our industry down,
[02:54:53.120 --> 02:54:55.120]  break us financially.
[02:54:55.120 --> 02:55:00.120]  This is a military, foreign, corporate, British East India Company style takeover.
[02:55:00.120 --> 02:55:02.120]  We're under total siege.
[02:55:02.120 --> 02:55:05.120]  And the cops, they're under attack, the military's under attack.
[02:55:05.120 --> 02:55:08.120]  Look at how they say veterans are the number one terror threat.
[02:55:08.120 --> 02:55:10.120]  That tells you who the government is.
[02:55:10.120 --> 02:55:14.120]  The government has been totally taken over at the federal level.
[02:55:14.120 --> 02:55:17.120]  And the good part about this show is we put it all in perspective as a think tank
[02:55:17.120 --> 02:55:20.120]  for even members of Congress, a bunch of them. Listen.
[02:55:20.120 --> 02:55:22.120]  A lot of them, listen.
[02:55:22.120 --> 02:55:26.120]  And I get Congress from, I was listening to your show yesterday about the
[02:55:26.120 --> 02:55:30.120]  more people dying from honeybees things than dying from terrorism.
[02:55:30.120 --> 02:55:31.120]  I call it another Congressperson.
[02:55:31.120 --> 02:55:34.120]  Well, we listened. We heard you two days ago, but, you know, we're not doing interviews right now.
[02:55:34.120 --> 02:55:37.120]  You know, we're afraid to come on.
[02:55:37.120 --> 02:55:40.120]  And everybody just stands around going, it's kind of crazy.
[02:55:40.120 --> 02:55:42.120]  You talk about Russian troops in America.
[02:55:42.120 --> 02:55:43.120]  It's kind of crazy.
[02:55:43.120 --> 02:55:47.120]  You talk about billions of bullets in the training manual saying it's for gun owners.
[02:55:47.120 --> 02:55:51.120]  Well, it says that the government is arming and training against us.
[02:55:51.120 --> 02:55:55.120]  And then having drills where they train to take us on with foreign troops.
[02:55:55.120 --> 02:56:01.120]  I mean, the first time I went to one of these drills and everything the old timers had told me was all true,
[02:56:01.120 --> 02:56:05.120]  including Raymond Teague, who was telling me all this stuff.
[02:56:05.120 --> 02:56:07.120]  And I didn't completely believe it.
[02:56:07.120 --> 02:56:12.120]  And then it all came true because he worked in Air Force intelligence with access to all the NSA stuff.
[02:56:12.120 --> 02:56:14.120]  And then he worked in other classified areas.
[02:56:14.120 --> 02:56:17.120]  And again, these guys would then go and warn people.
[02:56:17.120 --> 02:56:19.120]  There's a plan to bring in foreign troops.
[02:56:19.120 --> 02:56:21.120]  Oh, that guy's crazy. No, they saw it.
[02:56:21.120 --> 02:56:27.120]  They were there before we were, before it was rolled out against us.
[02:56:27.120 --> 02:56:29.120]  I'm going to come back and do some overdrive.
[02:56:29.120 --> 02:56:31.120]  Some stations carry it. Others don't.
[02:56:31.120 --> 02:56:33.120]  infowars.com.
[02:56:33.120 --> 02:56:37.120]  I want to get into this video that's up on infowars.com.
[02:56:37.120 --> 02:56:39.120]  The guy videotaping police, there's a whole bunch of them.
[02:56:39.120 --> 02:56:41.120]  He's like 60 yards away.
[02:56:41.120 --> 02:56:44.120]  They come over and say, turn around.
[02:56:44.120 --> 02:56:46.120]  I'm putting you in handcuffs for filming us.
[02:56:46.120 --> 02:56:49.120]  And then it looks like one of the cops punches him in the face.
[02:56:49.120 --> 02:56:52.120]  And the guy's dog jumps out of his car and runs over and they shoot it.
[02:56:52.120 --> 02:56:58.120]  And the cops are usual saying, well, this is a great thing because you're in Fallujah, folks.
[02:56:58.120 --> 02:57:01.120]  And now the CPS is coming in people's houses for no reason.
[02:57:01.120 --> 02:57:04.120]  They said they're going to take your kids without even having a reason to do it.
[02:57:04.120 --> 02:57:05.120]  It's insane.
[02:57:05.120 --> 02:57:07.120]  As I end this hour, please spread the word about the broadcast.
[02:57:07.120 --> 02:57:10.120]  We're going 110% against the New World Order.

[02:59:52.120 --> 02:59:55.120]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[02:59:55.120 --> 03:00:00.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:00.120 --> 03:00:10.120]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[03:00:10.120 --> 03:00:12.120]  You want answers?
[03:00:12.120 --> 03:00:14.120]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:14.120 --> 03:00:18.120]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:18.120 --> 03:00:23.120]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:23.120 --> 03:00:28.120]  All right, Professor Griff, famous founder of Public Enemy.
[03:00:28.120 --> 03:00:37.120]  He got off his bus, got checked at his hotel in Austin, and he is getting in a car in the next five minutes to drive over here to the studio.
[03:00:37.120 --> 03:00:39.120]  And he should be in there the last 30 minutes of the hour.
[03:00:39.120 --> 03:00:41.120]  So that should be interesting. It's been human person.
[03:00:41.120 --> 03:00:43.120]  So we're going to continue on.
[03:00:43.120 --> 03:00:48.120]  I want to give the phone number out to the military and police specifically.
[03:00:48.120 --> 03:00:56.120]  Homeland Security has now put out a public press release that Russian police and military are going to be here advising in advance
[03:00:56.120 --> 03:00:58.120]  in helping search American citizens.
[03:00:58.120 --> 03:01:00.120]  I mean, I told you that was coming.
[03:01:00.120 --> 03:01:03.120]  I mean, I've been to the urban warfare drills, but this has gone on forever.
[03:01:03.120 --> 03:01:06.120]  But they do this just to get everybody conditioned.
[03:01:06.120 --> 03:01:08.120]  And are you agreeing with what I'm saying? Are you disagreeing?
[03:01:08.120 --> 03:01:10.120]  I'd like to hear from you.
[03:01:10.120 --> 03:01:16.120]  The toll-free number to join us, police and military only, 800-259-9231.
[03:01:16.120 --> 03:01:19.120]  And I'll go to you quickly because Griff's coming up in about 30 minutes.
[03:01:19.120 --> 03:01:21.120]  So I'm going to come back, cover some news briefly.
[03:01:21.120 --> 03:01:23.120]  And then I want to get your take on this.
[03:01:23.120 --> 03:01:26.120]  This is paramilitary training you've been given.
[03:01:26.120 --> 03:01:33.120]  In fact, you guys print me the articles in the Wall Street Journal, but in a couple others, it was police train that citizens are insurgents.
[03:01:33.120 --> 03:01:37.120]  And of course, that's only in high crime areas, but then it's in every area.
[03:01:37.120 --> 03:01:39.120]  It's all military.
[03:01:39.120 --> 03:01:45.120]  And then the public starts taking on the idea that you're the enemy as well.
[03:01:45.120 --> 03:01:47.120]  This is the plan.
[03:01:47.120 --> 03:01:54.120]  They put us into these roles, citizen and police, and then just conditioned everybody to basically line up with each other and fight.
[03:01:54.120 --> 03:01:56.120]  I'd rather we wake up and realize what's happening.
[03:01:56.120 --> 03:02:01.120]  800-259-9231.
[03:02:01.120 --> 03:02:07.120]  And again, I don't want to hear, oh, they're just giving us their advice on how they set up police states over there.
[03:02:07.120 --> 03:02:09.120]  I've been to the drills.
[03:02:09.120 --> 03:02:10.120]  I've put out films.
[03:02:10.120 --> 03:02:11.120]  It's on record.
[03:02:11.120 --> 03:02:13.120]  They're all free online.
[03:02:13.120 --> 03:02:21.120]  I've got four police state films showing foreign troops training to confiscate our guns and saying it's for America with the Marines and the Army.
[03:02:21.120 --> 03:02:26.120]  I've shown police state checkpoints with Army and Marines on highways in America.
[03:02:26.120 --> 03:02:32.120]  I've shown police chiefs admit foreign troops with a Delta Force practicing to attack U.S. cities and courthouses.
[03:02:32.120 --> 03:02:38.120]  And then the John Warner Defense Authorization Act admitting it's for domestic operations.
[03:02:38.120 --> 03:02:44.120]  This is the reality, 800-259-9231.
[03:02:44.120 --> 03:02:45.120]  And we're going to go to break.
[03:02:45.120 --> 03:02:53.120]  This is a short segment and come back and go to your phone calls, David and Hawaii and others that are patiently holding.
[03:02:53.120 --> 03:02:56.120]  I see the phone lines have almost loaded up with police and military.
[03:02:56.120 --> 03:03:02.120]  We have one phone line idle at 800-259-9231.
[03:03:02.120 --> 03:03:06.120]  But first I'm going to cover and play the video here.
[03:03:06.120 --> 03:03:08.120]  All that he did was love me.
[03:03:08.120 --> 03:03:09.120]  Heartbreaking moment.
[03:03:09.120 --> 03:03:14.120]  Police shoot and kill dog that was defending owner when officers arrested him for filming them.
[03:03:14.120 --> 03:03:17.120]  And I would say the guy's filming while black and is that why he got arrested?
[03:03:17.120 --> 03:03:22.120]  And the cops have M-16s while they're out doing this, by the way.
[03:03:22.120 --> 03:03:25.120]  And the actual police, whatever they're doing is about 60 yards away.
[03:03:25.120 --> 03:03:27.120]  They've got some cars blocking the streets.
[03:03:27.120 --> 03:03:30.120]  So the guy knows, you know, he's been, he's been in Fallujah trained.
[03:03:30.120 --> 03:03:39.120]  He doesn't get past that line and they march over with their M-16s because he's got an evil cell phone camera and arresting.
[03:03:39.120 --> 03:03:46.120]  And then his dog with his leash tied to him jumps out and runs over in the cop shooting.
[03:03:46.120 --> 03:03:48.120]  Absolutely amazing.
[03:03:48.120 --> 03:03:52.120]  But when a police dog gets shot coming to somebody's house, they have a funeral,
[03:03:52.120 --> 03:03:58.120]  shut down Houston and act like, act like, you know, George Washington had just died.
[03:03:58.120 --> 03:04:00.120]  So see, it's all about turning your emotions on and off.
[03:04:00.120 --> 03:04:02.120]  When it's the government, oh, we have emotions.
[03:04:02.120 --> 03:04:03.120]  We love you.
[03:04:03.120 --> 03:04:04.120]  Oh, thank God for you.
[03:04:04.120 --> 03:04:09.120]  And again, I'll tell the story of being out there with a friend that has a boat on Lake Austin.
[03:04:09.120 --> 03:04:11.120]  There was nobody out there yesterday.
[03:04:11.120 --> 03:04:12.120]  Saw five boats.
[03:04:12.120 --> 03:04:16.120]  I saw the cops pull over the five boats.
[03:04:16.120 --> 03:04:17.120]  I saw two kayakers.
[03:04:17.120 --> 03:04:19.120]  I saw him go over and harass the kayakers.
[03:04:19.120 --> 03:04:24.120]  And when we drove by it, like 50 yards away, the cops were bugging their eyes out at us.
[03:04:24.120 --> 03:04:26.120]  We were sitting there very calmly looking at them.
[03:04:26.120 --> 03:04:30.120]  Then they pulled up behind us and were bugging their eyes out and looking real aggressive.
[03:04:30.120 --> 03:04:31.120]  I didn't stand up aggressively.
[03:04:31.120 --> 03:04:34.120]  I just stood there with a smile on my face, videotaping them.
[03:04:34.120 --> 03:04:35.120]  And that took the pleasure away.
[03:04:35.120 --> 03:04:37.120]  Then they all wave sheepishly.
[03:04:37.120 --> 03:04:39.120]  And again, those aren't bad men individually.
[03:04:39.120 --> 03:04:44.120]  They've been brought up that that's manly and that that's how you treat the American people.
[03:04:44.120 --> 03:04:45.120]  Because, you know, we're dangerous scum.
[03:04:45.120 --> 03:04:47.120]  Got to be kept in line for his safety.
[03:04:47.120 --> 03:04:49.120]  We're insurgents.
[03:04:49.120 --> 03:04:50.120]  Everyone's a criminal.
[03:04:50.120 --> 03:04:55.120]  Everyone's guilty until proven slave, except for them.
[03:04:55.120 --> 03:04:57.120]  We'll be right back.
[03:04:57.120 --> 03:05:26.120]  We'll be right back.
[03:05:27.120 --> 03:05:52.120]  We'll be right back.
[03:05:57.120 --> 03:06:01.120]  Or by calling 888-253-3139.
[03:06:27.120 --> 03:06:29.120]  Or by calling 888-253-3139.
[03:06:57.120 --> 03:07:01.120]  That's goberky.com today.
[03:07:27.120 --> 03:07:29.120]  That's goberky.com today.
[03:07:57.120 --> 03:07:59.120]  That's goberky.com today.
[03:08:27.120 --> 03:08:29.120]  That's goberky.com today.
[03:08:57.120 --> 03:09:03.120]  They come out with a lacroix bottled water and cookie dough and tell her, roll down her window.
[03:09:03.120 --> 03:09:05.120]  She goes to start the car so she can.
[03:09:05.120 --> 03:09:06.120]  They say, don't do that.
[03:09:06.120 --> 03:09:07.120]  They say, put your hands up.
[03:09:07.120 --> 03:09:09.120]  They say, open the door and put your hands up.
[03:09:09.120 --> 03:09:15.120]  They knock the windows out, slam her to the ground, charge her with assaulting them on video.
[03:09:15.120 --> 03:09:20.120]  And now they assault you, then you're charged and go to the gulag.
[03:09:20.120 --> 03:09:21.120]  And then I see this video.
[03:09:21.120 --> 03:09:23.120]  And again, this isn't anti-police.
[03:09:23.120 --> 03:09:25.120]  It's that you've been brainwashed.
[03:09:25.120 --> 03:09:26.120]  What you're doing is wrong.
[03:09:26.120 --> 03:09:29.120]  Cops in LA get out with M16s.
[03:09:29.120 --> 03:09:32.120]  They've got a dozen police cars blocking the street.
[03:09:32.120 --> 03:09:36.120]  A guy's at the end of where they block the street videotaping.
[03:09:36.120 --> 03:09:43.120]  The cops come over and watch the full unedited video on infowars.com.
[03:09:43.120 --> 03:09:47.120]  They put him in handcuffs and it looks like the cop hits him in the face.
[03:09:47.120 --> 03:09:48.120]  There's something to him.
[03:09:48.120 --> 03:09:51.120]  He turns with his back to the camera and then, boom, looks like something happens.
[03:09:51.120 --> 03:09:56.120]  The dog jumps out of the window, the Rottweiler, runs over and they shoot the Rottweiler.
[03:09:56.120 --> 03:10:00.120]  And now they're saying they did it for the man's safety.
[03:10:00.120 --> 03:10:02.120]  This is how they execute people.
[03:10:02.120 --> 03:10:03.120]  A lot of CIA guys.
[03:10:03.120 --> 03:10:04.120]  You've seen the famous case.
[03:10:04.120 --> 03:10:08.120]  What was he, Carney, down in Houston?
[03:10:08.120 --> 03:10:09.120]  Famous CIA section chief.
[03:10:09.120 --> 03:10:10.120]  They get him out of the car.
[03:10:10.120 --> 03:10:11.120]  His hands are on his side.
[03:10:11.120 --> 03:10:13.120]  The cop just shoots him in the head.
[03:10:13.120 --> 03:10:15.120]  They're like, oh, that's a good thing.
[03:10:15.120 --> 03:10:18.120]  So the death squads are now operated.
[03:10:18.120 --> 03:10:21.120]  And most of them have been in a heavy combat overseas.
[03:10:21.120 --> 03:10:24.120]  They've sat there with heavy machine guns at checkpoints.
[03:10:24.120 --> 03:10:27.120]  You've seen the entertainment videos where they just shoot up vehicles for fun.
[03:10:27.120 --> 03:10:31.120]  You've seen the death letters signed by the troops that have been ordered to kill all these people.
[03:10:31.120 --> 03:10:33.120]  And then come home and commit suicide.
[03:10:33.120 --> 03:10:35.120]  I mean, we're in a lot of trouble, folks.
[03:10:35.120 --> 03:10:36.120]  All this is coming home to roost.
[03:10:36.120 --> 03:10:39.120]  The new enemy in Al Qaeda, it's the conservative libertarians.
[03:10:39.120 --> 03:10:41.120]  And what a perfect plan.
[03:10:41.120 --> 03:10:47.120]  This was all sold to conservatives as a way to fight the extreme Muslims when the globalists run them.
[03:10:47.120 --> 03:10:51.120]  So I want to go to this clip and I'll narrate it for radio listeners.
[03:10:51.120 --> 03:10:53.120]  All he did was love me.
[03:10:53.120 --> 03:10:58.120]  Heartbreaking moment, police shoot and kill dog that was defending owner when officers arrested him for filming them.
[03:10:58.120 --> 03:11:01.120]  They can make up arguments about the Rottweiler.
[03:11:01.120 --> 03:11:08.120]  I mean, anybody knows you can just scream at a dog and they'll run off if you act aggressive unless it's been police trained.
[03:11:08.120 --> 03:11:10.120]  And that's usually a German shepherd.
[03:11:10.120 --> 03:11:12.120]  Those will jump for your throat and stuff.
[03:11:12.120 --> 03:11:16.120]  And I guess if some pit bulls will jump on your leg, they're mainly trained to kill dogs.
[03:11:16.120 --> 03:11:20.120]  I mean, I've seen them kill Chihuahuas or they go in your backyard and shoot your dog.
[03:11:20.120 --> 03:11:24.120]  I mean, I've seen them shoot labs here in Austin that are chained up because it's barking.
[03:11:24.120 --> 03:11:26.120]  And it's just total mental illness.
[03:11:26.120 --> 03:11:30.120]  And look, cops, America didn't act like this in the past.
[03:11:30.120 --> 03:11:31.120]  You may think it's okay now.
[03:11:31.120 --> 03:11:32.120]  Why are we doing it now?
[03:11:32.120 --> 03:11:34.120]  Why is everything else going bad?
[03:11:34.120 --> 03:11:40.120]  We're going to your calls here in a moment to David and propaganda machine and others that are patiently holding.
[03:11:40.120 --> 03:11:47.120]  We're talking to police and military about what they think of what I covered last hour, Russian troops in America to patrol security events.
[03:11:47.120 --> 03:11:54.120]  800-2599-231, 800-2599-231, police and military only right now.
[03:11:54.120 --> 03:11:55.120]  I want to get your take.
[03:11:55.120 --> 03:11:58.120]  What about old timers who were the military that were told about this?
[03:11:58.120 --> 03:12:01.120]  Because it was in government documents like 7277, State Department.
[03:12:01.120 --> 03:12:02.120]  Now it's public.
[03:12:02.120 --> 03:12:05.120]  What does that mean that now they're doing it publicly?
[03:12:05.120 --> 03:12:06.120]  800.
[03:12:06.120 --> 03:12:09.120]  Now, it's a lot more serious than what they're even telling you.
[03:12:09.120 --> 03:12:12.120]  This is just the ice breaking to make it sound normal.
[03:12:12.120 --> 03:12:14.120]  800-2599-231.
[03:12:14.120 --> 03:12:17.120]  Let's roll this very painful video and audio.
[03:12:17.120 --> 03:12:18.120]  Here it is.
[03:12:20.120 --> 03:12:22.120]  So he's filming them.
[03:12:22.120 --> 03:12:24.120]  Back it up a little bit more.
[03:12:24.120 --> 03:12:30.120]  Because some viewers are going to see this and think, oh, what did he do beforehand?
[03:12:30.120 --> 03:12:32.120]  Show it about 30 seconds before.
[03:12:32.120 --> 03:12:35.120]  So he's behind the police line, videotaping on an iPhone.
[03:12:35.120 --> 03:12:38.120]  Looks like an iPhone or a droid, a black droid.
[03:12:38.120 --> 03:12:39.120]  And the police look at him.
[03:12:39.120 --> 03:12:43.120]  They have M16s and they come over just total Goonland.
[03:12:43.120 --> 03:12:44.120]  Yeah, here it is.
[03:12:51.120 --> 03:12:54.120]  And again, I'm going to talk over it because some of the people filming from across the other street
[03:12:54.120 --> 03:12:58.120]  drop a few F-bombs and then we'll queue it up to the point when that happens.
[03:13:03.120 --> 03:13:06.120]  All right, now again, he's standing there videotaping police
[03:13:06.120 --> 03:13:08.120]  and the cops are saying something to him.
[03:13:08.120 --> 03:13:10.120]  You can't hear him because they're about 60 yards away
[03:13:10.120 --> 03:13:14.120]  and they start walking over to the man standing there with his video camera.
[03:13:14.120 --> 03:13:19.120]  And again, what they're mad about is that he's not bowing down and acting cowardly.
[03:13:19.120 --> 03:13:25.120]  Now it looks like they tell him to leave, so he starts walking away to put his dog in the car.
[03:13:25.120 --> 03:13:32.120]  And from everything I've ever seen with these videos, as soon as he acted like he wasn't a threat, that's when they come.
[03:13:32.120 --> 03:13:38.120]  The minute you grovel to paramilitary train police is the day it doesn't matter what you do,
[03:13:38.120 --> 03:13:41.120]  you're going to go to jail and you're going to have charges.
[03:13:41.120 --> 03:13:44.120]  And they say, turn around, go ahead and fade it up.
[03:13:44.120 --> 03:13:52.120]  And they grab his arms and they put handcuffs on him.
[03:13:52.120 --> 03:13:58.120]  And the dog has now been put in the car because the guy was going to leave.
[03:13:58.120 --> 03:14:03.120]  The dog's barking seeing the guy that feeds him being taken away.
[03:14:03.120 --> 03:14:05.120]  And they got their M16s out.
[03:14:05.120 --> 03:14:07.120]  Actually, those are MP5s.
[03:14:07.120 --> 03:14:09.120]  Those are hecklers.
[03:14:09.120 --> 03:14:13.120]  It's nine millimeters. I looked at them wrong earlier.
[03:14:13.120 --> 03:14:19.120]  And the dog sees daddy over there being manhandled, comes over, dog stops, dog scared.
[03:14:19.120 --> 03:14:26.120]  Cops don't care. They're still going to shoot it.
[03:14:26.120 --> 03:14:30.120]  There goes the cops. Boom, boom, boom.
[03:14:30.120 --> 03:14:34.120]  Kill the dog. Yeah, take him out.
[03:14:34.120 --> 03:14:37.120]  Put George Washington down like that. Yeah.
[03:14:37.120 --> 03:14:40.120]  Destroy America. Shoot the guy's dog for having courage.
[03:14:40.120 --> 03:14:42.120]  And it goes on and on and on.
[03:14:42.120 --> 03:14:46.120]  Now, let me show you another article that we're going to our guest on this.
[03:14:46.120 --> 03:14:48.120]  This is how they handle it in the Ukraine.
[03:14:48.120 --> 03:14:52.120]  Because they're not drinking fluoride over there, folks, which lowers testosterone.
[03:14:52.120 --> 03:14:56.120]  Ukraine, police units stormed after brutal rape.
[03:14:56.120 --> 03:14:59.120]  Protesters hurled firebomb, stormed local police station.
[03:14:59.120 --> 03:15:06.120]  Unit in southern Ukraine after authorities refused to detain one of two police officers implicated the brutal gang rape of a young woman.
[03:15:06.120 --> 03:15:08.120]  Well, I mean, I'm sure she deserved it.
[03:15:08.120 --> 03:15:11.120]  It makes sarcastic folks, poor dog, poor lady.
[03:15:11.120 --> 03:15:18.120]  Residents of the towns of 330 kilometers south of Kiev continue to rally outside the station Tuesday,
[03:15:18.120 --> 03:15:23.120]  booing the local governor and vowing to continue their vigil until the officer is arrested.
[03:15:23.120 --> 03:15:27.120]  During the storming late Monday, protesters smashed windows, broke doors, and set fire.
[03:15:27.120 --> 03:15:31.120]  And, of course, it was the Ukrainians and Polish that finally started fighting the secret police.
[03:15:31.120 --> 03:15:34.120]  Tired of their daughters being raped, they killed most of the Russian secret police.
[03:15:34.120 --> 03:15:38.120]  So they won't roll over, and that's why they're called terrorists.
[03:15:38.120 --> 03:15:43.120]  A very painful video to watch that dog up against, and dogs are smart, too.
[03:15:43.120 --> 03:15:47.120]  They could tell this is like, you know, three cops with guns. The dog knows it's a weapon.
[03:15:47.120 --> 03:15:49.120]  You name a squirt gun at a dog, it starts groveling.
[03:15:49.120 --> 03:15:54.120]  And that dog sees its daddy being drug-a-way, so it goes over to protect him, and they killed it.
[03:15:54.120 --> 03:15:58.120]  And they're going to make excuses, and they're going to make excuses when your bank accounts are taken.
[03:15:58.120 --> 03:16:01.120]  They're going to make excuses when you die of cancer from the vaccines.
[03:16:01.120 --> 03:16:05.120]  They're going to make excuses when Russians rape your children.
[03:16:05.120 --> 03:16:08.120]  It's not going to be mainly Russians, though. It's going to be Chinese that are meant to invade the U.S.
[03:16:08.120 --> 03:16:14.120]  That's in all the documents. That's why they're being given the Panama Canal and the Mexican ports and all of it.
[03:16:14.120 --> 03:16:17.120]  America is to be gutted one way or another.
[03:16:17.120 --> 03:16:23.120]  And you can bet the average cop out there will be side-by-side with Chinese trips and Mexican trips coming to your house.
[03:16:23.120 --> 03:16:26.120]  They'll do it in a minute, because they're all being trained with them.
[03:16:26.120 --> 03:16:30.120]  Now, let's go to David in Hawaii. David, what do you think of all this today?
[03:16:30.120 --> 03:16:31.120]  Really?
[03:16:31.120 --> 03:16:33.120]  Yeah, you say you're in the Army, sir. Go ahead.
[03:16:33.120 --> 03:16:37.120]  Yes, I am. This is David and I. I mean, about 23 years of experience.
[03:16:37.120 --> 03:16:45.120]  I just wanted to make one comment, and then I wanted to say something about the video clip you just showed, and if I had a chance to say something about vaccinations and military.
[03:16:45.120 --> 03:16:55.120]  But that video clip you just showed to the police officers, I mean, that's an example of kind of an extreme activity that's going on within the police departments.
[03:16:55.120 --> 03:16:58.120]  We do exchanges. We live in military programs all the time.
[03:16:58.120 --> 03:17:05.120]  But to bring in Russian troops, to bring in foreign soldiers, not only as unconstitutional in the United States of America,
[03:17:05.120 --> 03:17:11.120]  but what you just showed in that video clip is exactly what you're going to get with foreign forces patrolling large streets.
[03:17:11.120 --> 03:17:18.120]  Well, we're getting it with our police. But here's the issue. You can say you train with foreign troops in case there's a hostage situation in an Ato country.
[03:17:18.120 --> 03:17:25.120]  I've been to the drills. They say it's one thing, but really, it was for the occupation of the Bay Area and gun confiscation.
[03:17:25.120 --> 03:17:30.120]  I was able to get interrogations on video and have Marines off-record admit what was going on.
[03:17:30.120 --> 03:17:35.120]  And then the colonel love freaked out when he found out I had it on tape. That's because it's meant to acclimate you.
[03:17:35.120 --> 03:17:44.120]  This is an exchange program. Exactly. Now it's actually running events against American citizens. What do you make of that?
[03:17:44.120 --> 03:17:54.120]  Exactly. And that's my point, that, you know, whether other training operations were designed to acclimate people, that could be.
[03:17:54.120 --> 03:18:01.120]  But what you just showed, that video clip of the gentleman with his dog in his stride and him being detained, that is what you're going to get with foreign forces.
[03:18:01.120 --> 03:18:10.120]  We are, the U.S. military and police force are way more constrained with regards to how we handle people and civilians than foreign governments are.
[03:18:10.120 --> 03:18:16.120]  What do you just showed right there? And that's just what you put out about the people getting raped and everything like that.
[03:18:16.120 --> 03:18:20.120]  That's what you're going to get with foreign forces. And it's absolutely unconstitutional.
[03:18:20.120 --> 03:18:24.120]  You know, I'm retired now, but I mean, I could stomach that if I were an active person.
[03:18:24.120 --> 03:18:30.120]  Well, for people that don't know, George Washington hung people that raped or even abused people and the British were wild.
[03:18:30.120 --> 03:18:42.120]  But he knew just from a position of morale and with the public PR, the French, the British, they were separate sides, allies and enemies remarked on the comportment of U.S. forces.
[03:18:42.120 --> 03:18:52.120]  So from the beginning, the U.S. military was known for not torturing, not at all changed in Vietnam, obviously. But now we're known as getting very, very bad.
[03:18:52.120 --> 03:18:57.120]  According to what I read, you've been in the middle of it, but I've also seen what's been admitted.
[03:18:57.120 --> 03:19:03.120]  My whole issue is absolutely in Mexico, in Ukraine. I mean, the cops, if they see a woman, they rape her if they want to.
[03:19:03.120 --> 03:19:11.120]  North Korea, same deal. We are becoming like that. I mean, what do you think of the L.A. police coming over to the guy? That's an unedited video.
[03:19:11.120 --> 03:19:15.120]  He's just standing there videotaping them so they come over and arrest him and then kill his dog.
[03:19:15.120 --> 03:19:23.120]  Well, it goes right back to what the coverage of what happened to Boston. I mean, you're right, the shoot, Dave Grossman calls him the shoot.
[03:19:23.120 --> 03:19:32.120]  I mean, bottom line is, is that the guy was just taking a video just like all those people in Boston cowering in their homes and he's waiting to get their homes kicked in and so they get taken out of them.
[03:19:32.120 --> 03:19:47.120]  Listen, the cops, it was a game warden and a regular, it was Travis County on the river yesterday and they were driving around with their jaw stuck out, bugging out, look like, like, like they were bad guys in a movie.
[03:19:47.120 --> 03:20:00.120]  And I just got up and started, you know, basically laughing at them and then they waved and drove off, but I don't understand the mindset where people bug their eyes out at you and treat you like, like, because, you know,
[03:20:00.120 --> 03:20:11.120]  they treated me like the few times I was in juvenile hall for fights I'd get in and the cops get there and, you know, somebody's going in a hospital, you go to jail, even if you're found not guilty later or they drop the charges.
[03:20:11.120 --> 03:20:20.120]  I've experienced being in jail and the way the police act now in general is like, I'm a perpetrator. I'm already locked up in jail. Do you see what I'm saying?
[03:20:20.120 --> 03:20:27.120]  I mean, they really act aggressive and it's just, it's what I've experienced in third world countries. It's why I don't go to third world countries.
[03:20:27.120 --> 03:20:33.120]  My parents drug me to all sorts of third world countries when I was a kid because they wanted to go see stuff and I didn't like it when I was a kid.
[03:20:33.120 --> 03:20:36.120]  I don't like it now. What do you have to say to that?
[03:20:36.120 --> 03:20:43.120]  Well, I'm spot on. I know that all the people around the continental U.S. are all like, man, this isn't going to foreign countries so cool, so cool.
[03:20:43.120 --> 03:20:46.120]  And I said, hey, I've been to a lot of those foreign countries and it ain't cool.
[03:20:46.120 --> 03:20:54.120]  Nice face to see, watch them on TV, but you don't want to go to these other countries because what they do to people, innocent people, it's horrendous.
[03:20:54.120 --> 03:21:00.120]  Oh yeah, they target innocent people and to see America that used to be better, it really was.
[03:21:00.120 --> 03:21:12.120]  To now see us acting like Mexico or Honduras, the stuff I've seen is just very upsetting. I'll be honest though, I smile at them and show nice body language.
[03:21:12.120 --> 03:21:21.120]  I videotape police at checkpoints in Mexico. I videotape stuff like that and then they kind of look at you, but when you're not scared, then they just kind of go, well, that guy must be in charge or something.
[03:21:21.120 --> 03:21:26.120]  But what's sad is when a family grovels, then they are mean to him.
[03:21:26.120 --> 03:21:30.120]  Then as soon as the cops tell the guy leave and he does, then they come after him.
[03:21:30.120 --> 03:21:36.120]  I think he should have argued with him and said, hey, it's my first amendment, then the dog would have seen that body language.
[03:21:36.120 --> 03:21:42.120]  In my experience, if you grovel with bad cops, you're going to jail.
[03:21:42.120 --> 03:21:57.120]  I don't have the experience with actually arguing with cops, but I do know, I've had complications over the years and I will tell you that groveling is never the answer because the world, so to speak, aggressive people are going to feed on you being weak.
[03:21:57.120 --> 03:22:03.120]  And that's exactly what happened. The guy started complying with him and he was like, dude, I didn't do nothing. I would have gotten the car and drove off.
[03:22:03.120 --> 03:22:09.120]  But nobody complied with him and for them to just come down the street like that was completely out of line. There was no reason for them to do what they did.
[03:22:09.120 --> 03:22:13.120]  Exactly. I'm going to run to some other callers. God bless you, sir. I mean, I know this.
[03:22:13.120 --> 03:22:18.120]  Most cops run into her nice and friendly, but it's whatever ones they've got that are interfacing with the general public.
[03:22:18.120 --> 03:22:23.120]  In the old days, you called a cop if something was going on or they were driving around and saw something, they dealt with it.
[03:22:23.120 --> 03:22:27.120]  Now it's all about general public. It's all about we've done something wrong.
[03:22:27.120 --> 03:22:37.120]  And for me to look at us the way that those cops were looking at other people, I would, I mean, if I was driving up to somebody looking at them,
[03:22:37.120 --> 03:22:40.120]  the way these cops were looking at families with kids and stuff.
[03:22:40.120 --> 03:22:45.120]  I mean, I look at somebody like this if I'm coming to beat the brains out.
[03:22:45.120 --> 03:22:52.120]  I mean, if I've got my jaw out and my eyes open up and I'm bugging my eyes out and trying to, I mean, I don't try to intimidate people.
[03:22:52.120 --> 03:22:55.120]  I mean, if I'm looking like that, you are about to get stomped on.
[03:22:55.120 --> 03:23:02.120]  And so somebody's first looking at me like that. I'm like that dog. I'm going to go mmm and start, you know, thinking, I just can't help it.
[03:23:02.120 --> 03:23:07.120]  I'm like, I just can't help it anymore. That's why I will not go to third world countries.
[03:23:07.120 --> 03:23:13.120]  Because when I've watched Mexican troops and police sit there and pull over the bus and grab the money from the bus driver and laugh at them.
[03:23:13.120 --> 03:23:19.120]  And the guys crying and the cops are all arrogant and sticking their chest out and like enjoying their criminality.
[03:23:19.120 --> 03:23:25.120]  And then I see that in American cops. I just start going, I just can't handle it.
[03:23:25.120 --> 03:23:32.120]  All right, let's go ahead and take another call here. Propaganda machine who's in the Air Force from FEMA Region 9.
[03:23:32.120 --> 03:23:36.120]  Formally, what area were you in? You're now under Globalist Occupied Region 9.
[03:23:36.120 --> 03:23:38.120]  What area is that? That's up in...
[03:23:38.120 --> 03:23:42.120]  That's, no, Region 9 I think is West Coast.
[03:23:42.120 --> 03:23:45.120]  That's right. Yeah, there's two. Two areas. Yeah, one of them is...
[03:23:45.120 --> 03:23:49.120]  I guess you're the Southwest Coast and the North is Region 10, right?
[03:23:49.120 --> 03:23:52.120]  Yeah, I think you're right about that.
[03:23:52.120 --> 03:23:56.120]  You're in Region 9. Good to know you're under FEMA occupation. Go ahead.
[03:23:56.120 --> 03:24:00.120]  Anyways, hey, everything you've been talking about is right on.
[03:24:00.120 --> 03:24:08.120]  But I think for a lot of folks, for the average folks, the people that are recently awake, it's maybe a little overwhelming.
[03:24:08.120 --> 03:24:15.120]  And I wanted to suggest something that's maybe not so overwhelming, you know, something to wake other people up.
[03:24:15.120 --> 03:24:23.120]  That is a movie that's been out for a long time, a movie that I think is older than you and about as old as I am.
[03:24:23.120 --> 03:24:29.120]  It's a movie from the 60s and it's called Fahrenheit 451.
[03:24:29.120 --> 03:24:37.120]  And it's a pretty interesting flick. It's got a German actor in the lead and it also has Julie Christie.
[03:24:37.120 --> 03:24:41.120]  Yeah, that's a book by Bradbury, right?
[03:24:41.120 --> 03:24:45.120]  That's a book by Ray Bradbury, but this is the Hollywood version of it.
[03:24:45.120 --> 03:24:49.120]  And a remake of it is an equilibrium.
[03:24:49.120 --> 03:24:56.120]  That one I have not seen. But anyways, this one, I actually watched with my family. You know, my mom is older.
[03:24:56.120 --> 03:25:03.120]  This was kind of a great introduction to her to visit some of these things. She had never seen this movie.
[03:25:03.120 --> 03:25:10.120]  And it happened about the time of some of the follow-up from the Boston bombing.
[03:25:10.120 --> 03:25:16.120]  By watching this with her, with some of the stuff that was in there, I was able to kind of, you know, it kind of
[03:25:16.120 --> 03:25:22.120]  inoculated her from some of the official spin that came because you saw in that movie how things were played out.
[03:25:22.120 --> 03:25:30.120]  I don't want to give it away for anybody, but that movie from the mid-60s is, I think, a ripe for a reviewing right now.
[03:25:30.120 --> 03:25:36.120]  Absolutely. God bless you. I'm going to jump to others. Anthony in New York says he's police. Are you current or retired, Anthony?
[03:25:36.120 --> 03:25:41.120]  Go ahead, Anthony. Are you there, buddy?
[03:25:41.120 --> 03:25:43.120]  Yeah. How are you doing, Alex?
[03:25:43.120 --> 03:25:45.120]  Good. Are you currently on the force or retired?
[03:25:45.120 --> 03:25:53.120]  Yeah. Yeah. And I'm still working. And I'd just like to make a comment about the police shooting, the video that you were just talking about.
[03:25:53.120 --> 03:25:54.120]  Yes.
[03:25:54.120 --> 03:26:00.120]  Okay. Just to let you know, a couple of bad apples could definitely spoil a whole bunch.
[03:26:00.120 --> 03:26:15.120]  I did see the guy videotaping. The two police officers, in my opinion, I don't want to Monday and I quarterback it, but you could simply weave and ignore people videotaping because that's what you're allowed to do.
[03:26:15.120 --> 03:26:25.120]  You know, for the most part, the police officer that drew his gun and shot the dog, I did see the dog jump, but you know what?
[03:26:25.120 --> 03:26:41.120]  The streets aren't the okay corral. Some people to pull and draw and shoot a dog like that, a bullet can definitely ricochet.
[03:26:41.120 --> 03:26:48.120]  Oh, yeah. That was pretty dangerous, that close. Well, for those that don't know, around here they shoot dogs if they just bark at them.
[03:26:48.120 --> 03:26:59.120]  I think once they escalated the dogs leaping, I know why they shot it, but why did they immediately grab the guy? Why did they start manhandling him when they could see a dog was hanging out a window?
[03:26:59.120 --> 03:27:10.120]  I would have said, go put your dog up, even if they were going to arrest him for no reason. I mean, we do have a right to videotape police, the Supreme Court's ruled, as long as it doesn't interfere with their duties.
[03:27:10.120 --> 03:27:13.120]  And I don't think 60 yards away he was doing that.
[03:27:13.120 --> 03:27:27.120]  Yes, sir. I agree with you. But I do definitely think that there should be some kind of retraining, because like I said, when you get into the police department, Alex, we're just all normal people, okay, just like you.
[03:27:27.120 --> 03:27:37.120]  A lot of times we don't talk to the news because everything we say or do is misconstrued by the media to make us look bad.
[03:27:37.120 --> 03:27:38.120]  Sure.
[03:27:38.120 --> 03:27:50.120]  That's why a lot of times when you say, oh, the police just don't talk or they just give orders, because when the news is there, a lot of times things are cut and put on the news.
[03:27:50.120 --> 03:28:00.120]  No, no, I know how the mainstream media is. And I understand that. That's why I said, I don't want to just be in a fight with the police, because that's what they want is an us against them, another form of balkanization.
[03:28:00.120 --> 03:28:16.120]  But I'm saying the training, the direction is authoritarian. They want to make the American police forces authoritarian. Real quick, what is your take on the Russian troops to not be part of a drill, but to actually oversee security operations against the American people?
[03:28:16.120 --> 03:28:18.120]  Yeah, it's bad news.
[03:28:18.120 --> 03:28:41.120]  Did you ever think they'd openly announced that? No, no, absolutely not. I don't really see. I mean, I'm not military. But if I had to work side by side with a Russian soldier, I would hope that he would have the same views that I have.
[03:28:41.120 --> 03:28:45.120]  We all have families. We all want our streets and our people protected.
[03:28:45.120 --> 03:28:54.120]  I know, but it's unconstitutional to have our military on the streets much. See, they've already gotten us used to that. Now it's going to be foreign troops. See how this works?
[03:28:54.120 --> 03:28:55.120]  Yes.
[03:28:55.120 --> 03:29:08.120]  I mean, here's the deal. We've got to ask, how many orders will we follow? How far will we go? Is there any order that citizens won't follow? And is there any order police won't follow?
[03:29:08.120 --> 03:29:17.120]  I mean, will we let foreign banks take our bank accounts like Cyprus? They're saying Congress is having hearings on that. That's my point. Is there any order you won't follow?
[03:29:17.120 --> 03:29:43.120]  Oh, well, you know, we'll have to use our own common sense when it comes to orders. Because I really have never, I mean, if I got an order that I felt that wasn't something that I felt was justified, then I would just say I'm not going to do it because I don't feel that that's the way I want to do it.
[03:29:43.120 --> 03:29:49.120]  You have discretion unless there's something criminal going on.
[03:29:49.120 --> 03:29:51.120]  I hear you. Police need to support the Constitution.
[03:29:51.120 --> 03:29:55.120]  We're on the march. The Empire is on the run. Alex Jones.

[03:33:23.120 --> 03:33:27.120]  Professor Griff is here in studio with us.
[03:33:27.120 --> 03:33:30.120]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, I am your host, Alex Jones.
[03:33:30.120 --> 03:33:34.120]  We're in overdrive on this Tuesday Worldwide Edition.
[03:33:34.120 --> 03:33:37.120]  And I'm going to try to pull him over to the nightly news tonight as well.
[03:33:37.120 --> 03:33:44.120]  And I'm going to try to get some of the crew backstage to talk to some of the people that he's on tour with as well to get his take on it all.
[03:33:44.120 --> 03:33:47.120]  But Professor Griff, I heard you wanted to ask me questions today.
[03:33:47.120 --> 03:33:51.120]  Yeah, when your people contacted me, I said, let's do something different.
[03:33:51.120 --> 03:33:58.120]  Let me ask a few questions, tapping into the hearts and minds of the people that are in the street and just some things that they might want to know.
[03:33:58.120 --> 03:34:01.120]  So I just wrote down about four or five questions, I'm going to shoot them at you.
[03:34:01.120 --> 03:34:03.120]  And let's see what happens.
[03:34:03.120 --> 03:34:04.120]  Absolutely.
[03:34:04.120 --> 03:34:11.120]  Professor Griff, again, one of the founders of Public Enemy Hip Hop Rap Sensation for decades now,
[03:34:11.120 --> 03:34:17.120]  touring the country all over the place, but also very politically aware and spiritually aware and involved.
[03:34:17.120 --> 03:34:19.120]  Frequent guests are often on guests via the phone.
[03:34:19.120 --> 03:34:20.120]  It's great to have you here in person.
[03:34:20.120 --> 03:34:21.120]  Thank you.
[03:34:21.120 --> 03:34:25.120]  It was great to shake your hand over there during the short break.
[03:34:25.120 --> 03:34:27.120]  What is your take as an Army veteran?
[03:34:27.120 --> 03:34:29.120]  What is your take on this whole new world order?
[03:34:29.120 --> 03:34:36.120]  What is your take on Snowden and now announcements that Russian troops are going to help control the American people?
[03:34:36.120 --> 03:34:39.120]  I mean, we're entering the Twilight Zone.
[03:34:39.120 --> 03:34:50.120]  Well, you know, I've had this information for quite some time and putting this information out in popular entertainment and popular culture,
[03:34:50.120 --> 03:34:57.120]  putting it on an album and mixing it on a CD and talking about it in different interviews.
[03:34:57.120 --> 03:35:05.120]  It comes as a shock to some people to talk about how the roads and bridges and ports are owned by foreign governments.
[03:35:05.120 --> 03:35:09.120]  A lot of times you just don't...
[03:35:09.120 --> 03:35:10.120]  They're not even allowed to be owned by America under globalism.
[03:35:10.120 --> 03:35:12.120]  And it's the same thing than the globalists own their stuff.
[03:35:12.120 --> 03:35:13.120]  Right.
[03:35:13.120 --> 03:35:18.120]  So when you pull up documents like this and you show the people and you read it and you show them the information,
[03:35:18.120 --> 03:35:19.120]  they're kind of blown away.
[03:35:19.120 --> 03:35:21.120]  And you don't want to say, I told you so.
[03:35:21.120 --> 03:35:26.120]  So we're at that stage of the game now in popular entertainment and popular culture.
[03:35:26.120 --> 03:35:30.120]  We actually put it in the song and let them know that this is what's going on.
[03:35:30.120 --> 03:35:33.120]  Whether you like it or not, study it or be a victim of it.
[03:35:33.120 --> 03:35:38.120]  It's like $21 billion to ship General Motors to China.
[03:35:38.120 --> 03:35:40.120]  And it doesn't even help the Chinese people.
[03:35:40.120 --> 03:35:41.120]  Right.
[03:35:41.120 --> 03:35:42.120]  They're building robots to replace them.
[03:35:42.120 --> 03:35:43.120]  It's madness.
[03:35:43.120 --> 03:35:44.120]  Right.
[03:35:44.120 --> 03:35:45.120]  Exactly.
[03:35:45.120 --> 03:35:51.120]  So these particular jobs and the American people suffer at the hands of people that never cared about them in the first place.
[03:35:51.120 --> 03:35:52.120]  All right.
[03:35:52.120 --> 03:35:54.120]  Well, listen, you've got the floor then.
[03:35:54.120 --> 03:35:56.120]  You've got to ask Alex.
[03:35:56.120 --> 03:36:01.120]  But first off, tell us about the websites, your site, public enemy site and some of the great shows you've got coming up.
[03:36:01.120 --> 03:36:03.120]  What's my wife's birthday?
[03:36:03.120 --> 03:36:06.120]  We didn't already have something planned two months ago with family.
[03:36:06.120 --> 03:36:08.120]  I would be coming in on some of the crews begging to go.
[03:36:08.120 --> 03:36:10.120]  You've got quite a lineup.
[03:36:10.120 --> 03:36:11.120]  Oh, yeah.
[03:36:11.120 --> 03:36:14.120]  We're on the Kings and the Mike tour with LL Cool J, Ice Cube.
[03:36:14.120 --> 03:36:16.120]  Now these are two movie stars now.
[03:36:16.120 --> 03:36:23.120]  And every chance we get, we try to pull them backstage and pull them to the side and say, do you know that some of these things are going on?
[03:36:23.120 --> 03:36:29.120]  And then they kind of, they take to it, but you know, they strictly about the music and about them.
[03:36:29.120 --> 03:36:32.120]  Any idea how much good they could do if we got them going for Liberty?
[03:36:32.120 --> 03:36:33.120]  Ice Cube is the one.
[03:36:33.120 --> 03:36:35.120]  I pulled them aside, him and his manager.
[03:36:35.120 --> 03:36:40.120]  And they want me to submit a script for a movie that I put together.
[03:36:40.120 --> 03:36:41.120]  Oh, awesome.
[03:36:41.120 --> 03:36:43.120]  And yeah, I definitely like to see what you'll be.
[03:36:43.120 --> 03:36:45.120]  Professor Griff always waking people up.
[03:36:45.120 --> 03:36:47.120]  I'm trying to get in the best way I know how.
[03:36:47.120 --> 03:36:51.120]  But I like to sit with some, put some think tank together.
[03:36:51.120 --> 03:36:53.120]  Let's think about some of the things that we need to kind of implement.
[03:36:53.120 --> 03:36:57.120]  And hopefully Ice Cube could help us get it on the big and the small screen.
[03:36:57.120 --> 03:36:59.120]  He's in a position to also take advantage of it.
[03:36:59.120 --> 03:37:00.120]  He's willing.
[03:37:00.120 --> 03:37:01.120]  Well, that's the thing.
[03:37:01.120 --> 03:37:02.120]  All, you know, it's funny.
[03:37:02.120 --> 03:37:05.120]  You said all this stuff about rappers and stuff that I thought was pretty scary.
[03:37:05.120 --> 03:37:08.120]  And then it all sort of coming out in the news right after you shed it.
[03:37:08.120 --> 03:37:09.120]  Right.
[03:37:09.120 --> 03:37:11.120]  About how it's a weird sex cult and the Luminati.
[03:37:11.120 --> 03:37:12.120]  Exactly.
[03:37:12.120 --> 03:37:13.120]  Now they're all bragging.
[03:37:13.120 --> 03:37:14.120]  That's what they're in.
[03:37:14.120 --> 03:37:16.120]  Yeah, I think now they're trying to make it.
[03:37:16.120 --> 03:37:20.120]  Well, you call you, you say it's so much becomes less important.
[03:37:20.120 --> 03:37:21.120]  Everybody.
[03:37:21.120 --> 03:37:22.120]  They're acclimating.
[03:37:22.120 --> 03:37:23.120]  They're just throwing it out.
[03:37:23.120 --> 03:37:24.120]  It's a fad.
[03:37:24.120 --> 03:37:25.120]  Everybody needs to do this year.
[03:37:25.120 --> 03:37:26.120]  Right.
[03:37:26.120 --> 03:37:30.120]  They're too dangerous and people still losing their lives and losing their minds and ultimately
[03:37:30.120 --> 03:37:33.120]  losing their souls.
[03:37:33.120 --> 03:37:35.120]  I don't know why they're into this.
[03:37:35.120 --> 03:37:38.120]  Reportedly Lady Gaga has been confirmed by multiple friends and managers.
[03:37:38.120 --> 03:37:42.120]  Someone has to sleep in the room with her and she's tortured by demons and thinks she's
[03:37:42.120 --> 03:37:44.120]  falling around by ghost.
[03:37:44.120 --> 03:37:46.120]  Well, yeah, you're telling little girls to worship the devil.
[03:37:46.120 --> 03:37:48.120]  Bad stuff's going to happen to you.
[03:37:48.120 --> 03:37:49.120]  Exactly.
[03:37:49.120 --> 03:37:51.120]  Beyonce has this alter ego she calls.
[03:37:51.120 --> 03:37:56.120]  It's her entity that lives inside of her.
[03:37:56.120 --> 03:38:01.120]  She calls Sasha fierce Lady Gaga mentioned the fact that there's a young 13 year old
[03:38:01.120 --> 03:38:05.120]  white gay individual lives inside of her, which is called Roman.
[03:38:05.120 --> 03:38:07.120]  So they're admitting these things.
[03:38:07.120 --> 03:38:08.120]  These things are out there.
[03:38:08.120 --> 03:38:10.120]  People are just not taking it serious.
[03:38:10.120 --> 03:38:14.120]  This is the actual demon possession and they're going to rituals in front of millions of
[03:38:14.120 --> 03:38:18.120]  people in front of Tony Blair admitted that he falls to the ground every morning and is
[03:38:18.120 --> 03:38:20.120]  possessed by the angel of light.
[03:38:20.120 --> 03:38:21.120]  This is mainstream news.
[03:38:21.120 --> 03:38:25.120]  And he said, yeah, what's the big deal and flops around on the ground.
[03:38:25.120 --> 03:38:26.120]  The devil's called the angel of light.
[03:38:26.120 --> 03:38:28.120]  I mean, you can't make this up.
[03:38:28.120 --> 03:38:29.120]  Definitely can't.
[03:38:29.120 --> 03:38:30.120]  Definitely can't make this up.
[03:38:30.120 --> 03:38:34.120]  But these are the things that need to be brought out to let the people know that this is actual
[03:38:34.120 --> 03:38:36.120]  fact and this is real.
[03:38:36.120 --> 03:38:39.120]  How can you, I mean, I know you're not around it a lot, but how can you be around these
[03:38:39.120 --> 03:38:40.120]  some of this stuff?
[03:38:40.120 --> 03:38:42.120]  Well, you know, my thing is touch and go.
[03:38:42.120 --> 03:38:44.120]  I guess you're waking them up.
[03:38:44.120 --> 03:38:47.120]  And that's probably one of the main issues why they got hands off.
[03:38:47.120 --> 03:38:52.120]  That's the Griff campaign, which they're going to have to have a campaign because I'm going
[03:38:52.120 --> 03:38:53.120]  to get in their chest regardless.
[03:38:53.120 --> 03:38:55.120]  I'm going to be in their face.
[03:38:55.120 --> 03:38:56.120]  You understand what I'm saying?
[03:38:56.120 --> 03:38:57.120]  So they got to deal with it regardless.
[03:38:57.120 --> 03:39:00.120]  Yeah, you're you're a really hard soldier for the truth out there.
[03:39:00.120 --> 03:39:01.120]  Exactly.
[03:39:01.120 --> 03:39:02.120]  I have to be.
[03:39:02.120 --> 03:39:03.120]  I have to be.
[03:39:03.120 --> 03:39:05.120]  So well, it's all coming out.
[03:39:05.120 --> 03:39:08.120]  I mean, I mean, it's coming out with a lot of them.
[03:39:08.120 --> 03:39:12.120]  There's some of them that's still, you know, lip service and then they say is.
[03:39:12.120 --> 03:39:14.120]  But in a minute, they're not going to be able to deny it.
[03:39:14.120 --> 03:39:19.120]  But I read about how unhappy all these devil worshipers are, whether they're white or black
[03:39:19.120 --> 03:39:20.120]  or whatever it is.
[03:39:20.120 --> 03:39:24.120]  It is like reportedly it gets bad right away.
[03:39:24.120 --> 03:39:27.120]  I mean, it's it's like they're not even happy doing this.
[03:39:27.120 --> 03:39:29.120]  I mean, no, no, they're not.
[03:39:29.120 --> 03:39:32.120]  But then, you know, they're hiding behind the wealth, hiding behind the fact that they can
[03:39:32.120 --> 03:39:36.120]  take a private plane to central place and wear and party for a weekend and, you know,
[03:39:36.120 --> 03:39:38.120]  drink, then it troubles away.
[03:39:38.120 --> 03:39:42.120]  But you got to come right back to the same reality, right back to the same reality.
[03:39:42.120 --> 03:39:44.120]  And then music industry is not getting any better.
[03:39:44.120 --> 03:39:49.120]  It's spilling over into the entertainment aspect when the movie stars, television stars,
[03:39:49.120 --> 03:39:52.120]  and it's spilling over into sports.
[03:39:52.120 --> 03:39:55.120]  And yeah, the National Baseball League, they've now confirmed people didn't believe it.
[03:39:55.120 --> 03:39:56.120]  We first put it out.
[03:39:56.120 --> 03:39:59.120]  They've now responded and said we were just joking, but we do believe in witchcraft.
[03:39:59.120 --> 03:40:03.120]  They put witchcraft, hard core stuff up on during the baseball game.
[03:40:03.120 --> 03:40:04.120]  Did you see that video?
[03:40:04.120 --> 03:40:05.120]  No, no, I didn't see it.
[03:40:05.120 --> 03:40:06.120]  I didn't see it.
[03:40:06.120 --> 03:40:08.120]  But I know some of the other.
[03:40:08.120 --> 03:40:10.120]  I mean, the athletes can't mention their name just yet.
[03:40:10.120 --> 03:40:13.120]  But a lot of them have came out to seeking help.
[03:40:13.120 --> 03:40:15.120]  How do they deal with this kind of thing?
[03:40:15.120 --> 03:40:20.120]  Because they act, they're being asked to be a part of this commercial, this television
[03:40:20.120 --> 03:40:24.120]  show, this movie, this cult, you know, in order to enhance their careers.
[03:40:24.120 --> 03:40:26.120]  And this is very real.
[03:40:26.120 --> 03:40:27.120]  You know what's happening?
[03:40:27.120 --> 03:40:28.120]  I got you in here.
[03:40:28.120 --> 03:40:29.120]  I'm going to have to get you on the nightly news.
[03:40:29.120 --> 03:40:31.120]  Ask your questions, my friend.
[03:40:31.120 --> 03:40:36.120]  Well, one of my first questions is, can you comment on the revelations about the U.S.
[03:40:36.120 --> 03:40:39.120]  domestic spying and how does that affect the average person on the street?
[03:40:39.120 --> 03:40:41.120]  But I want to ask you that.
[03:40:41.120 --> 03:40:46.120]  I think the people in the street want to know from you that Professor Griffith's asking
[03:40:46.120 --> 03:40:48.120]  this question for them.
[03:40:48.120 --> 03:40:49.120]  Absolutely.
[03:40:49.120 --> 03:40:53.120]  The average cat with an iPhone with some of his songs on it, he doesn't think it affects
[03:40:53.120 --> 03:40:54.120]  him.
[03:40:54.120 --> 03:40:55.120]  This is why it affects you.
[03:40:55.120 --> 03:40:56.120]  People say, well, I'm not a spy.
[03:40:56.120 --> 03:40:57.120]  I'm not a terrorist.
[03:40:57.120 --> 03:40:58.120]  Why do I care?
[03:40:58.120 --> 03:40:59.120]  No, they're there to make sure the terrorists can attack.
[03:40:59.120 --> 03:41:00.120]  They run Al Qaeda.
[03:41:00.120 --> 03:41:02.120]  They run the extremist groups to get Islam killing each other.
[03:41:02.120 --> 03:41:03.120]  That's all on record.
[03:41:03.120 --> 03:41:08.120]  They want to know what you believe and what you think to use that intel to be able to package
[03:41:08.120 --> 03:41:11.120]  propaganda to effectively control you.
[03:41:11.120 --> 03:41:14.120]  It's the same reason people say, I have nothing to hide.
[03:41:14.120 --> 03:41:16.120]  I'll put where I live and what I own on Facebook.
[03:41:16.120 --> 03:41:18.120]  Then thieves use that to rob you.
[03:41:18.120 --> 03:41:20.120]  Well, think about the globalists as the big thieves in the sky.
[03:41:20.120 --> 03:41:21.120]  Right.
[03:41:21.120 --> 03:41:22.120]  Google, we all seeing eye.
[03:41:22.120 --> 03:41:26.120]  Frodo hadn't done anything wrong, but why did he not want to be seen by Sauron?
[03:41:26.120 --> 03:41:28.120]  Because Sauron wanted to kill him.
[03:41:28.120 --> 03:41:32.120]  In fact, your privacy is to protect you because if you don't have privacy, you don't have
[03:41:32.120 --> 03:41:33.120]  freedom.
[03:41:33.120 --> 03:41:39.320]  So they're using the NSA to spy on everybody, to know your mind, to build a database on
[03:41:39.320 --> 03:41:43.120]  you, and they can also break into your computer and plant stuff on you.
[03:41:43.120 --> 03:41:45.120]  That's another reason the back doors are bad.
[03:41:45.120 --> 03:41:46.120]  Right.
[03:41:46.120 --> 03:41:52.120]  The average person that uses Facebook, how would their information be used against them
[03:41:52.120 --> 03:41:53.120]  in the future?
[03:41:53.120 --> 03:41:56.720]  It'll be, it's given to the FBI to create digital face print scans.
[03:41:56.720 --> 03:41:59.320]  So face scanning cameras can track everywhere you go.
[03:41:59.320 --> 03:42:03.320]  And then Facebook, to prove that you quote, it's your Facebook, will say, are these your
[03:42:03.320 --> 03:42:04.320]  friends from high school?
[03:42:04.320 --> 03:42:05.320]  Right.
[03:42:05.320 --> 03:42:07.320]  Did you ever ask how it knows a photo as you with your friends from high school?
[03:42:07.320 --> 03:42:08.320]  Right, right, right.
[03:42:08.320 --> 03:42:11.820]  It's comparing a face scan with you and your friends to make you interface with it to give
[03:42:11.820 --> 03:42:13.320]  it human intelligence.
[03:42:13.320 --> 03:42:14.320]  Right.
[03:42:14.320 --> 03:42:18.800]  The computer is using you, Facebook is really an NSA computer.
[03:42:18.800 --> 03:42:23.120]  This has come out that is trying to become artificially aware, and it's using humans
[03:42:23.120 --> 03:42:24.120]  to train it.
[03:42:24.120 --> 03:42:25.120]  So.
[03:42:25.120 --> 03:42:26.120]  It's a war game.
[03:42:26.120 --> 03:42:27.120]  Brain fingerprinting.
[03:42:27.120 --> 03:42:28.120]  Is this true, false?
[03:42:28.120 --> 03:42:29.120]  Absolutely.
[03:42:29.120 --> 03:42:33.680]  So if you committed a crime, they can plug you up to this machine, go into your brain
[03:42:33.680 --> 03:42:35.360]  to figure out whether or not you committed this crime.
[03:42:35.360 --> 03:42:37.520]  Well, they can also show you subliminals.
[03:42:37.520 --> 03:42:41.320]  Everyone is subliminally being programmed with brain fingerprinting to then have false
[03:42:41.320 --> 03:42:42.320]  arrests in the future.
[03:42:42.320 --> 03:42:47.560]  Then they have false pre-crime where they claim the machine knows you're going to commit
[03:42:47.560 --> 03:42:49.600]  a crime, but really it's not true.
[03:42:49.600 --> 03:42:52.920]  But they'll bust some real people with it to legitimize its use.
[03:42:52.920 --> 03:42:53.920]  Right.
[03:42:53.920 --> 03:42:57.920]  Will America account for and admit domestic drone killings?
[03:42:57.920 --> 03:43:02.440]  Yes, they admit the program, but then doubly say it isn't real and you're a cuckoo if you
[03:43:02.440 --> 03:43:03.920]  cover it, as Robert Gibbs said.
[03:43:03.920 --> 03:43:04.920]  Remember that?
[03:43:04.920 --> 03:43:05.920]  Yeah.
[03:43:05.920 --> 03:43:06.920]  Remember that.
[03:43:06.920 --> 03:43:07.920]  He said, yeah, it exists, but I'm supposed to tell you it doesn't.
[03:43:07.920 --> 03:43:11.400]  Then he laughs at you, which is all part, again, thrown at your face.
[03:43:11.400 --> 03:43:13.920]  Will we ever have a list of people that they've targeted?
[03:43:13.920 --> 03:43:17.560]  Will we ever have a list of the organizations that they targeted?
[03:43:17.560 --> 03:43:22.280]  It turns out any group against the New World Order, mainly libertarian groups, again, when
[03:43:22.280 --> 03:43:26.400]  Obama's in, he targets the right wing, so the left wing gets behind it.
[03:43:26.400 --> 03:43:30.320]  When a Republican gets in, they target the left wing, so Republicans get behind it, and
[03:43:30.320 --> 03:43:32.480]  then everybody basically accepts it.
[03:43:32.480 --> 03:43:36.280]  So we're talking about targeting in the wake of the IRS skin, is the government using the
[03:43:36.280 --> 03:43:42.200]  non-government agency, such as the IRS, to target American groups that are not primarily
[03:43:42.200 --> 03:43:43.200]  for or against...
[03:43:43.200 --> 03:43:45.080]  This is called classical authoritarianism.
[03:43:45.080 --> 03:43:46.880]  Now, you have to explain that to me.
[03:43:46.880 --> 03:43:51.120]  Well, it's just that's what every corrupt regime uses, the tax police, to selectively
[03:43:51.120 --> 03:43:52.520]  target and harass people.
[03:43:52.520 --> 03:43:55.000]  We've always known they've done this to people that get out of line.
[03:43:55.000 --> 03:43:57.880]  You know they've done it to entertainers and people that don't tell the line.
[03:43:57.880 --> 03:44:00.480]  People get told, watch out, you're going to get audited.
[03:44:00.480 --> 03:44:04.400]  And now they're kind of admitting an all too scared people and to create a chilling effect.
[03:44:04.400 --> 03:44:05.760]  It's really a coming out.
[03:44:05.760 --> 03:44:08.000]  Like Snowden isn't a double agent.
[03:44:08.000 --> 03:44:13.160]  He means well, I've analyzed it, this is my opinion, but of all the whistleblowers, they
[03:44:13.160 --> 03:44:18.040]  chose him because he ran so they can make it look like it's traitorous, and then they
[03:44:18.040 --> 03:44:20.520]  could use going after him as a way to scare everybody.
[03:44:20.520 --> 03:44:28.280]  That's interesting, two more questions, has the agenda of the elitist oligarchy of evil
[03:44:28.280 --> 03:44:36.440]  changed their plan for what you've observed in the Bilderberger meeting?
[03:44:36.440 --> 03:44:41.760]  Based on the information that you've seen and heard in reference to the Bilderberger's
[03:44:41.760 --> 03:44:44.800]  meeting, has the plan changed?
[03:44:44.800 --> 03:44:50.720]  Oh, there's a general mega plan that's at least as old as 1850 by the eugenicists from
[03:44:50.720 --> 03:44:55.120]  England, this is on record, to find out how the body works, to create a scientific way
[03:44:55.120 --> 03:44:59.160]  to control people, to set up a worldwide grid of control and then kill the majority of the
[03:44:59.160 --> 03:45:00.160]  world population.
[03:45:00.160 --> 03:45:02.240]  That's been their plan for 160 years.
[03:45:02.240 --> 03:45:07.720]  They're only now getting within grasp of it, but their plan is still way behind.
[03:45:07.720 --> 03:45:10.160]  And so they're in a race against free humanity.
[03:45:10.160 --> 03:45:13.680]  They believe to become gods, and they don't want to give this power to what they see as
[03:45:13.680 --> 03:45:19.360]  the profane people who aren't ruthless like them, so there's a race by humanity to decide
[03:45:19.360 --> 03:45:20.360]  the future destiny.
[03:45:20.360 --> 03:45:25.080]  And yeah, they're always fine-tuning the plan, but it's the same ancient plan.
[03:45:25.080 --> 03:45:30.120]  And then when you read back to Egypt or Babylon or Greece, some of the more ancient cultures,
[03:45:30.120 --> 03:45:35.080]  the oldest cultures, this was all being debated then, it was the same camps then.
[03:45:35.080 --> 03:45:38.720]  People that wanted to give knowledge to the people and bring humanity forward or the priests
[03:45:38.720 --> 03:45:43.840]  that wanted to use it to dominate and control so that they could believe, they believe become
[03:45:43.840 --> 03:45:44.840]  gods.
[03:45:44.840 --> 03:45:45.840]  Okay.
[03:45:45.840 --> 03:45:47.840]  This is a question I didn't have written down.
[03:45:47.840 --> 03:45:54.480]  I wanted to ask you, just face-to-face, I know you're not a rapper per se, but you think
[03:45:54.480 --> 03:46:00.680]  we might be able to kind of construct an album to get this out for the people that can't
[03:46:00.680 --> 03:46:01.680]  necessarily read.
[03:46:01.680 --> 03:46:05.880]  It was in a very heartfelt phone call I received from a guy.
[03:46:05.880 --> 03:46:11.720]  He said he's purchased my three books, and he just wanted to show support.
[03:46:11.720 --> 03:46:14.520]  By the way, we sell all three of your great books at importstore.com.
[03:46:14.520 --> 03:46:15.520]  You bet.
[03:46:15.520 --> 03:46:16.520]  Thank you very much.
[03:46:16.520 --> 03:46:17.520]  It's very deep.
[03:46:17.520 --> 03:46:24.400]  People don't want low-level lightweight stuff, then your books are what they need because
[03:46:24.400 --> 03:46:27.400]  they're definitely heavyweight stuff, but very deep, a lot of great perspectives.
[03:46:27.400 --> 03:46:32.520]  I've studied history a lot myself, and I even learned some things by reading your book so
[03:46:32.520 --> 03:46:34.520]  we can always learn more.
[03:46:34.520 --> 03:46:36.040]  I believe that's what they're scared of.
[03:46:36.040 --> 03:46:40.720]  I know they're scared of entertainment and music having a positive message.
[03:46:40.720 --> 03:46:45.240]  That's why I've talked to high-level people that worked at MTV and a top rock star who
[03:46:45.240 --> 03:46:49.280]  were there in the meetings when they said, we're getting rid of all this music that has
[03:46:49.280 --> 03:46:50.960]  a political thing for liberty.
[03:46:50.960 --> 03:46:57.920]  We're going to bring in nothing but just thug-kill-death party, evil rock and roll, evil rap, everything.
[03:46:57.920 --> 03:47:02.920]  So obviously, that's the answer, and it's for people to consume the alternative stuff
[03:47:02.920 --> 03:47:05.720]  that in many cases is better and not the devil worship stuff.
[03:47:05.720 --> 03:47:06.720]  Right.
[03:47:06.720 --> 03:47:11.120]  So do you think we can, as Karris wants to, educate, marry the education component to
[03:47:11.120 --> 03:47:12.120]  the entertainment component?
[03:47:12.120 --> 03:47:14.400]  I'm talking about Griffin and Alex Jones.
[03:47:14.400 --> 03:47:15.400]  Sure, absolutely.
[03:47:15.400 --> 03:47:16.400]  Let's make it happen.
[03:47:16.400 --> 03:47:22.400]  I mean, maybe I come up with some ideas for lyrics, but not probably not very good, but
[03:47:22.400 --> 03:47:23.400]  let's just make it happen.
[03:47:23.400 --> 03:47:25.840]  No, but if you do some, I mean, you're doing political stuff.
[03:47:25.840 --> 03:47:29.160]  It's just that I think it's important.
[03:47:29.160 --> 03:47:36.160]  I'm sure you've heard that Paris song he put out like a decade ago about 9-11, and I think
[03:47:36.160 --> 03:47:39.520]  of that song, it's like a history lesson in three minutes.
[03:47:39.520 --> 03:47:42.000]  I think something like that's kind of the model.
[03:47:42.000 --> 03:47:46.520]  There's been groups that have came before that have done this thing.
[03:47:46.520 --> 03:47:49.920]  Of course, like Karris won Brand Newby and has pulled right through the teachers, and
[03:47:49.920 --> 03:47:54.240]  there's groups that's been out there that's been pulling the message in the songs.
[03:47:54.240 --> 03:48:01.360]  But for some strange reason, they want to make it very cutesy, popular, pop-ish, and
[03:48:01.360 --> 03:48:02.360]  play down.
[03:48:02.360 --> 03:48:03.360]  It's important.
[03:48:03.360 --> 03:48:06.240]  No, I think it should be hardcore like you do and like others do, because that's when
[03:48:06.240 --> 03:48:07.240]  people need the truth.
[03:48:07.240 --> 03:48:09.720]  And people say, oh, don't scare us.
[03:48:09.720 --> 03:48:10.720]  We need to be scared.
[03:48:10.720 --> 03:48:12.040]  There's fears there to get you moving.
[03:48:12.040 --> 03:48:13.040]  Right.
[03:48:13.040 --> 03:48:15.240]  Because people, I mean, you can't just put this under the rug.
[03:48:15.240 --> 03:48:18.560]  You have to admit that it's only going to get worse if we lay down.
[03:48:18.560 --> 03:48:19.560]  Right.
[03:48:19.560 --> 03:48:25.520]  We're on stage with Rage Against the Machine probably twice in our career.
[03:48:25.520 --> 03:48:27.560]  And we sit around and we talk.
[03:48:27.560 --> 03:48:31.040]  We just say, you know something, they probably don't want public enemy in a Rage Against
[03:48:31.040 --> 03:48:33.920]  the Machine kind of collaboration.
[03:48:33.920 --> 03:48:39.760]  Because both of these groups are high-packed, high-energy, and reach the masses of the people.
[03:48:39.760 --> 03:48:44.600]  Do you think we'll see these collaborations in the future politicize?
[03:48:44.600 --> 03:48:45.600]  Absolutely.
[03:48:45.600 --> 03:48:50.040]  I mean, the reason I like your music is that it's not about left or right.
[03:48:50.040 --> 03:48:52.640]  It's about common sense waking up and not being a slave.
[03:48:52.640 --> 03:48:56.640]  If you take Rage Against the Machine, incredible music, I'm a fan of the way it sounds.
[03:48:56.640 --> 03:48:58.560]  And I've interviewed some people involved.
[03:48:58.560 --> 03:48:59.560]  They're good guys.
[03:48:59.560 --> 03:49:03.400]  Like, they're more socialist, but they'll criticize Obama when the rest of the left
[03:49:03.400 --> 03:49:05.320]  won't when he does something bad.
[03:49:05.320 --> 03:49:10.360]  My whole thing is I realize socialism has been created as kind of a fake escape valve.
[03:49:10.360 --> 03:49:13.000]  Because then it collectivizes things yet again.
[03:49:13.000 --> 03:49:19.000]  But that would be an incredible mix, I think, of public enemy and Rage.
[03:49:19.000 --> 03:49:21.000]  I mean, I think that would be a great collaboration.
[03:49:21.000 --> 03:49:22.000]  Right.
[03:49:22.000 --> 03:49:27.120]  It's very critical that you talk about this simply because during the inauguration celebration,
[03:49:27.120 --> 03:49:31.120]  Lupe Fiasco, I'm not sure if you're familiar with his work, got pulled off the stage by
[03:49:31.120 --> 03:49:36.480]  the Secret Service because he wasn't doing an anti-Barack Obama song, just basically
[03:49:36.480 --> 03:49:40.160]  talking about the government, how corrupt the government is, and Secret Service shut
[03:49:40.160 --> 03:49:42.120]  him down and pulled him off stage.
[03:49:42.120 --> 03:49:44.680]  But to him after that, we're not sure.
[03:49:44.680 --> 03:49:47.880]  We sent, we should call him, we should try to get a hold of him and find out if my crew
[03:49:47.880 --> 03:49:48.880]  should.
[03:49:48.880 --> 03:49:51.000]  If you've got the contacts, we'd love to talk to him.
[03:49:51.000 --> 03:49:55.880]  We sent Dan Badandi to the press conferences with the drill they were having in the photos
[03:49:55.880 --> 03:50:00.120]  from the Boston bombing, and they had Secret Service come over and get in his face and
[03:50:00.120 --> 03:50:01.120]  threaten him.
[03:50:01.120 --> 03:50:02.120]  And it's on video.
[03:50:02.120 --> 03:50:06.480]  You see all these big shaved head guys come over, and Dan to his credit didn't back down.
[03:50:06.480 --> 03:50:10.920]  And then they told the media, you don't talk to him on TV, and the media didn't.
[03:50:10.920 --> 03:50:14.320]  That's how enslaved they are, that they follow these orders.
[03:50:14.320 --> 03:50:17.800]  And yeah, the Secret Service is becoming the Praetorian Guard.
[03:50:17.800 --> 03:50:22.240]  And now look at Obama, the war crimes in Syria, the war crimes in Libya, invading eight different
[03:50:22.240 --> 03:50:26.120]  African countries the last six months, putting troops now in Gaza.
[03:50:26.120 --> 03:50:28.280]  U.S. troops have now been put in Gaza.
[03:50:28.280 --> 03:50:29.800]  It's not even on our news.
[03:50:29.800 --> 03:50:31.360]  It's in the back of Reuters.
[03:50:31.360 --> 03:50:35.080]  And again, only Obama could get away with this.
[03:50:35.080 --> 03:50:36.840]  I mean, people will lay down to anything now.
[03:50:36.840 --> 03:50:42.140]  Just like KRS-1 said in Obama Deception, America was on the edge of revolution under
[03:50:42.140 --> 03:50:43.140]  Bush.
[03:50:43.140 --> 03:50:44.640]  They put Obama in, everybody just sat out.
[03:50:44.640 --> 03:50:48.280]  Yes, everybody got quiet, passive, and laid down.
[03:50:48.280 --> 03:50:49.280]  This is weird, though.
[03:50:49.280 --> 03:50:50.280]  You're asking me questions.
[03:50:50.280 --> 03:50:51.280]  We're going to come back with Professor Griff.
[03:50:51.280 --> 03:50:53.520]  Fire out your website real quick.
[03:50:53.520 --> 03:51:00.880]  www.peagriff.info and www.publicenemy.com Sure, and I bet the show's already sold out tonight.
[03:51:00.880 --> 03:51:01.880]  We'll be right back.
[03:51:01.880 --> 03:51:02.880]  Already sold out.
[03:51:02.880 --> 03:51:09.280]  My friends, myself, my family, the Infowars.com team want to relay to you and your families
[03:51:09.280 --> 03:51:14.520]  that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalist on every front.
[03:51:14.520 --> 03:51:18.440]  Infowars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats.
[03:51:18.440 --> 03:51:21.120]  But we can't do that without your help.
[03:51:21.120 --> 03:51:26.400]  By getting the films, bumper stickers, and t-shirts at Infowars.com, you will wake up
[03:51:26.400 --> 03:51:32.440]  people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.
[03:51:32.440 --> 03:51:35.920]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[03:51:35.920 --> 03:51:42.120]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[03:51:42.120 --> 03:51:49.680]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization,
[03:51:49.680 --> 03:51:51.920]  and ultimate extermination.
[03:51:51.920 --> 03:51:53.480]  The war is here.
[03:51:53.480 --> 03:51:55.320]  It's an Infowar.
[03:51:55.320 --> 03:52:01.640]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[03:52:01.640 --> 03:52:03.640]  Have you ever consumed protein powder supplements?
[03:52:03.640 --> 03:52:04.640]  I have.
[03:52:04.640 --> 03:52:06.120]  And all of them don't taste that good.
[03:52:06.120 --> 03:52:09.240]  Have artificial flavors, sweeteners, or unhealthy sugars?
[03:52:09.240 --> 03:52:13.520]  About a year ago, I was introduced to a new protein powder that changed my experience.
[03:52:13.520 --> 03:52:17.400]  This protein powder made me feel noticeably better, and it tasted more delicious than
[03:52:17.400 --> 03:52:19.360]  any drink I've ever had.
[03:52:19.360 --> 03:52:22.400]  Here's the experience of one satisfied user named Rich.
[03:52:22.400 --> 03:52:26.880]  The term best of all worlds has been belabored to death, and yet I've just discovered a
[03:52:26.880 --> 03:52:31.920]  weight protein powder that truly deserves to be called best of all worlds, best taste
[03:52:31.920 --> 03:52:35.040]  by far, best results by far.
[03:52:35.040 --> 03:52:39.440]  You almost feel like you're cheating at something that tastes that good could be so good for
[03:52:39.440 --> 03:52:40.440]  you.
[03:52:40.440 --> 03:52:42.600]  Thank you, Steven, and cocoon nutrition.
[03:52:42.600 --> 03:52:47.320]  One World Way truly is the best of all worlds, the only way for me.
[03:52:47.320 --> 03:52:49.640]  You're truly Rich from Georgia.
[03:52:49.640 --> 03:52:52.040]  Real user, real happy.
[03:52:52.040 --> 03:53:01.440]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit OneWorldWay.com, that's OneWorldWHEY.com.
[03:53:01.440 --> 03:53:06.160]  We all know the terrible damage that viruses and bacteria can inflict in the human body.
[03:53:06.160 --> 03:53:11.360]  Dozens of diseases are caused by infectious organisms, and now the emergence of superbugs
[03:53:11.360 --> 03:53:16.280]  that are resistant to antibiotics poses an even bigger threat to our safety.
[03:53:16.280 --> 03:53:20.560]  Don't wait for the medical world to discover a new treatment for the latest superbug.
[03:53:20.560 --> 03:53:26.160]  It's important to realize that a simple, safe, and effective alternative already exists.
[03:53:26.160 --> 03:53:28.320]  Supernatural Silver.
[03:53:28.320 --> 03:53:32.440]  Advances in silver technology have given us a silver solution that is effective against
[03:53:32.440 --> 03:53:34.520]  these pathogens.
[03:53:34.520 --> 03:53:38.200]  Supernatural Silver can help the body fight against the diseases that can endanger your

[03:37:42.620 --> 03:54:43.240] 're very nice fresh off playing last night or on a bus from Dallas, coming
[03:54:43.240 --> 03:54:45.280]  into Austin to run over here into this interview.
[03:54:45.280 --> 03:54:46.280]  I really appreciate it.
[03:54:46.280 --> 03:54:47.280]  Oh, give thanks.
[03:54:47.280 --> 03:54:48.600]  I really appreciate that.
[03:54:48.600 --> 03:54:49.600]  Tell us about your books.
[03:54:49.600 --> 03:54:51.460]  We sell all three of them.
[03:54:51.460 --> 03:54:59.220]  My first book, the three that I got to you guys, Analytics, it was just 20 years of conversation
[03:54:59.220 --> 03:55:00.220]  and interviews.
[03:55:00.220 --> 03:55:04.060]  A lot of times, you know, to get a book like that to the average cat in the street, they're
[03:55:04.060 --> 03:55:05.060]  not reading that.
[03:55:05.060 --> 03:55:06.460]  You understand what I'm saying?
[03:55:06.460 --> 03:55:14.580]  I put it in an interview form, like I'm talking to you now, and it's very, very, very, very
[03:55:14.580 --> 03:55:17.220]  easy to read, so to speak.
[03:55:17.220 --> 03:55:22.260]  My second book, the Psychological Covert Warm Hip-Hop, which I have with me right here,
[03:55:22.260 --> 03:55:24.660]  the Illuminati's Takeover of Hip-Hop Discipline.
[03:55:24.660 --> 03:55:25.660]  That's powerful.
[03:55:25.660 --> 03:55:26.660]  That's powerful.
[03:55:26.660 --> 03:55:31.500]  Yeah, talk about the culture bandits, and kind of going into it.
[03:55:31.500 --> 03:55:37.020]  The last book I put out is the acapella revolution, letting these young cats know, like Lupe Fiasco
[03:55:37.020 --> 03:55:40.300]  that, you know, you can do the research, here's how to do it.
[03:55:40.300 --> 03:55:41.940]  The research is out there to be done.
[03:55:41.940 --> 03:55:45.580]  Here's some of the subjects, here's some of my formulas that I've used in Public Enemy
[03:55:45.580 --> 03:55:47.300]  to do the research.
[03:55:47.300 --> 03:55:48.300]  Well, I mean, take Muse.
[03:55:48.300 --> 03:55:51.700]  I know for a fact that Bellamy's a listener, I've talked to him on Fair Before, talked
[03:55:51.700 --> 03:55:53.100]  to him on air.
[03:55:53.100 --> 03:55:58.420]  His management, you know, of Muse came to him and said, shut up, don't do this anymore,
[03:55:58.420 --> 03:56:01.860]  and even got him to backtrack on some of what he says he could be more successful.
[03:56:01.860 --> 03:56:06.700]  I mean, they try to keep people literally on a very short leash, and why?
[03:56:06.700 --> 03:56:08.860]  Why should you politically have to do what they say?
[03:56:08.860 --> 03:56:10.500]  Well, you know, silence is really no excuse.
[03:56:10.500 --> 03:56:14.500]  A lot of times when you're quiet, you know, there's no guarantee that you're going to
[03:56:14.500 --> 03:56:16.740]  be more successful.
[03:56:16.740 --> 03:56:21.100]  There's a lot of artists that we can mention that were speaking out, very vocal, ended
[03:56:21.100 --> 03:56:26.140]  up being quiet and disappearing, one way or the other.
[03:56:26.140 --> 03:56:27.140]  That's right.
[03:56:27.140 --> 03:56:28.820]  In fact, that's what Jim Garrison said from the Kennedy thing.
[03:56:28.820 --> 03:56:31.900]  He said, if you're public, you better stay public, they tell you, shut up, that's when
[03:56:31.900 --> 03:56:32.900]  they come kill you.
[03:56:32.900 --> 03:56:36.020]  Exactly, because you take yourself out of the public's view in the public's eye, and
[03:56:36.020 --> 03:56:38.740]  people wonder what happened to you, and they think you just kind of fell off and stopped
[03:56:38.740 --> 03:56:39.740]  making music.
[03:56:39.740 --> 03:56:43.860]  No, they injected you with something and put something in your food or whatever else,
[03:56:43.860 --> 03:56:45.220]  and now you have to be quiet.
[03:56:45.220 --> 03:56:48.660]  That's why they either kill you or brain damage you like Ronald Reagan.
[03:56:48.660 --> 03:56:51.060]  Exactly, and we don't think it happens.
[03:56:51.060 --> 03:56:52.060]  It happens all the time.
[03:56:52.060 --> 03:56:57.140]  You see, young black men think it's a white people eye spy thing that you see on TV and
[03:56:57.140 --> 03:56:58.140]  the movie.
[03:56:58.140 --> 03:57:02.260]  They don't think this stuff really happens to real people in everyday real life, and
[03:57:02.260 --> 03:57:03.260]  it does.
[03:57:03.260 --> 03:57:06.740]  Well, they should know the drugs being brought into their neighborhoods came in on Army C-130.
[03:57:06.740 --> 03:57:12.020]  See, but when we explain these things, they don't, in most cases, they don't care where
[03:57:12.020 --> 03:57:13.340]  it's coming from.
[03:57:13.340 --> 03:57:17.980]  When you explain to them that, look, several years ago, there was an influx of this type
[03:57:17.980 --> 03:57:18.980]  of drug.
[03:57:18.980 --> 03:57:22.620]  A minute ago, black people didn't pop pills and do all this kind of stuff.
[03:57:22.620 --> 03:57:32.220]  Now it's readily available, and to most cases, to rappers, entertainers, and sports players.
[03:57:32.220 --> 03:57:39.100]  Mae Brussels did an article, and she talked about the CIA during the Monterey Pop Festival
[03:57:39.100 --> 03:57:42.820]  and some of these festivals during the counterculture during the 60s.
[03:57:42.820 --> 03:57:46.500]  You see, I was the one bringing the drugs in and offering for free.
[03:57:46.500 --> 03:57:50.180]  And that's all been declassified, and Gary Webb writes about it, and they blow his head
[03:57:50.180 --> 03:57:51.180]  off.
[03:57:51.180 --> 03:57:52.180]  Exactly.
[03:57:52.180 --> 03:57:54.420]  What do you think about Michael Hastings' car blowing up?
[03:57:54.420 --> 03:57:58.980]  That was very critical, because I remember, what is it, gentlemen that wrote, There is
[03:57:58.980 --> 03:58:06.740]  a River, Walter Rodney, I believe, and he died in the same kind of way, and I say to myself,
[03:58:06.740 --> 03:58:10.660]  okay, well, man, that was a terrible accident, but now that I have knowledge of myself and
[03:58:10.660 --> 03:58:12.460]  knowledge of what's going on.
[03:58:12.460 --> 03:58:14.420]  What about Malcolm X's grandson?
[03:58:14.420 --> 03:58:15.420]  That's clearly a hit.
[03:58:15.420 --> 03:58:18.140]  Now that was very critical, but that was very interesting, because there was three or four
[03:58:18.140 --> 03:58:21.620]  stories that were being circulated at the same time, and you know, that's a tactic that
[03:58:21.620 --> 03:58:22.620]  they use now.
[03:58:22.620 --> 03:58:24.860]  They confuse you at the out start.
[03:58:24.860 --> 03:58:26.700]  You know what, we're going to do a ten minute interview for the nightly news, and you've
[03:58:26.700 --> 03:58:27.700]  got to go and get ready.
[03:58:27.700 --> 03:58:32.260]  Professor Griff is here, get his books at infowarstore.com, and please spread the word
[03:58:32.260 --> 03:58:33.260]  about infowarstore.com.
[03:58:33.260 --> 03:58:36.340]  We are risking our lives to bring you this information.
[03:58:36.340 --> 03:58:43.340]  God bless you all.
