[00:00.000 --> 00:21.760]  The answer to 1984 is 1776, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[00:21.760 --> 00:29.960]  Well searches for the term World War 3 have broken the planetary record because we're
[00:29.960 --> 00:32.960]  closer to World War 3 than this planet has ever been.
[00:32.960 --> 00:37.840]  Of course I've been telling you that the last few years we were entering this phase, that's
[00:37.840 --> 00:44.160]  what top analysts are saying, MSM said I was a fearmonger for being absolutely on target.
[00:44.160 --> 00:47.680]  Now I have children, I'm trying to stop World War 3.
[00:47.680 --> 00:52.400]  I want to taunt with Russia and China and other nations and I don't want to be outlawed
[00:52.400 --> 00:54.080]  with radical Islam.
[00:54.080 --> 00:58.440]  Here we are on this 12th day of April 2017.
[00:58.440 --> 00:59.880]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:59.880 --> 01:05.520]  They've got the big communist birthday of the founding dictator of North Korea coming
[01:05.520 --> 01:13.920]  up on April 15th, not just income tax day, but Kim Jong-un's grandfather's birthday.
[01:13.920 --> 01:19.440]  It's his 100th and something birthday and that's when they're set to test an atomic bomb.
[01:19.440 --> 01:23.880]  And Paul Watson has the headline Trump may be prepping to hit nuclear sites.
[01:23.880 --> 01:30.600]  Now Trump's been in the news and they say they are prepped and ready to hit.
[01:30.600 --> 01:35.760]  From space, from sea, from land, from air.
[01:35.760 --> 01:42.160]  That's right, we're not just land, sea, and air, there's also space command and that's
[01:42.160 --> 01:47.560]  the key to this whole situation, the most secretive part of the breakaway civilization
[01:47.560 --> 01:50.800]  that we live at the bottom of.
[01:50.800 --> 01:54.880]  Coming back, I'm going to play a clip from Monday where I told you, I also said it on
[01:54.880 --> 02:00.000]  Sunday, but they found the clip from Monday that I had to talk to folks very close to
[02:00.000 --> 02:09.000]  the president, very close to the president, closer than his wife, okay, I'm going to stop.
[02:09.000 --> 02:12.080]  The media just can't stand the fact that we've got these connections.
[02:12.080 --> 02:17.440]  White House source, Trump pushes back against an EOcon plan to invade Syria.
[02:17.440 --> 02:22.840]  Now I told you that on Sunday and on Monday, we wrote an article, several of the paragraphs
[02:22.840 --> 02:27.760]  are transcripts of what the president said.
[02:27.760 --> 02:31.520]  And I just almost don't even want to say that because the media goes so crazy with it.
[02:31.520 --> 02:34.000]  But I did say that on Sunday, I did say that on Monday.
[02:34.000 --> 02:38.840]  What happened last night?
[02:38.840 --> 02:43.640]  And I do this more and more because MSM says we're fake because we are the opposite, ladies
[02:43.640 --> 02:49.080]  and gentlemen, and they know it and they can't stand it.
[02:49.080 --> 02:56.080]  Trump, we're not going into Syria.
[02:56.080 --> 03:02.480]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen, we're not going into Syria.
[03:02.480 --> 03:05.160]  Let's go ahead and play that clip right now.
[03:05.160 --> 03:09.560]  And we're not going into Syria because you know there were some questions, Nikki Halley
[03:09.560 --> 03:16.080]  is doing a great job, Rex is doing a fantastic job, our Secretary of State, General McMaster,
[03:16.080 --> 03:17.080]  fantastic.
[03:17.080 --> 03:20.680]  But if you add it all up and if they take every little word, they'll say, oh, they're
[03:20.680 --> 03:21.680]  different.
[03:21.680 --> 03:24.360]  Just so you understand, we're not going into Syria.
[03:24.360 --> 03:32.000]  But when I see people using horrible, horrible chemical weapons, which they agreed not to
[03:32.000 --> 03:36.520]  use under the Obama administration, but they violated it.
[03:36.520 --> 03:37.520]  They said they got rid of them.
[03:37.520 --> 03:43.560]  Look, what I did should have been done by the Obama administration a long time before
[03:43.560 --> 03:44.560]  I did it.
[03:44.560 --> 03:47.680]  And you would have had a much better, I think Syria would be a lot better off right now
[03:47.680 --> 03:50.040]  than it has been.
[03:50.040 --> 03:55.880]  You know why the FBI admits a month ago in Congress that I'm under investigation and
[03:55.880 --> 03:59.240]  that I'm being wiretapped?
[03:59.240 --> 04:05.240]  Because I talk to the president and I talk to people to talk to the president every day
[04:05.240 --> 04:07.120]  and they want to be able to say, Mr. President.
[04:07.120 --> 04:08.560]  He's under investigation.
[04:08.560 --> 04:10.200]  You can't talk to Alex Jones.
[04:10.200 --> 04:13.200]  That's why they want to put Bannon under FBI investigation and let me give you a little
[04:13.200 --> 04:14.200]  newsflash.
[04:14.200 --> 04:17.120]  Bannon's been under FBI investigation, but they haven't had the nerve to announce that
[04:17.120 --> 04:18.440]  yet.
[04:18.440 --> 04:19.440]  And so that's what they do.
[04:19.440 --> 04:25.000]  They just put everybody under investigation, except the Democratic Party that's been in
[04:25.000 --> 04:30.800]  bed with Russia since the Democratic Party sent people over to Russia to overthrow the
[04:30.800 --> 04:32.840]  Tsar in 1917.
[04:32.840 --> 04:36.640]  Yes, that was a Democratic Party operation out of New York.
[04:36.640 --> 04:37.640]  New York, baby.
[04:37.640 --> 04:39.680]  That's mainline history books.
[04:39.680 --> 04:45.320]  And then you point your finger at Mr. Red, White, and Blue and say, I'm a Rusky agent.
[04:45.320 --> 04:48.480]  I mean, yeah, I like Russian Vodka.
[04:48.480 --> 04:49.480]  Russian women are very beautiful.
[04:49.480 --> 04:51.920]  So I'll just, I mean, I'll, I mean, is that okay?
[04:51.920 --> 04:55.120]  We'll be back with huge, I mean, I mean, huge news.
[04:55.120 --> 05:01.880]  Stay with us.
[05:01.880 --> 05:05.240]  The more things change, the more they stay the same.
[05:05.240 --> 05:11.520]  A few months ago, President-elect Donald Trump told an audience during his victory tour that
[05:11.520 --> 05:15.720]  his administration will not take part in regime changes.
[05:15.720 --> 05:22.000]  We will stop looking to topple regimes and overthrow governments, folks.
[05:22.000 --> 05:27.920]  That was then, and this is now after the false flag chemical attack in Syria, which was blamed
[05:27.920 --> 05:28.920]  on Assad.
[05:28.920 --> 05:34.600]  The neocons and the military industrial complex have convinced the new president that its
[05:34.600 --> 05:38.960]  business as usual and the regime changes will commence.
[05:38.960 --> 05:43.080]  My attitude toward Syria and Assad has changed very much.
[05:43.080 --> 05:50.040]  Well, the only difference is this time the American patriots won't be fooled again.

[08:11.640 --> 08:16.360]  threw against us failed now just because we defeated these
[08:16.360 --> 08:21.320]  tyrants for now doesn't mean we've won the war the war is happening within our
[08:21.320 --> 08:27.280]  hearts within our souls and our minds we have to be good we have to be pure we
[08:27.280 --> 08:31.080]  have to be strong we have to build prosperity we have to bring every one
[08:31.080 --> 08:35.400]  of every race color and creed together if we're going to truly defeat these
[08:35.400 --> 08:38.880]  tyrants who believed we were going to fail who believed their divide and
[08:38.880 --> 08:45.720]  conquer would work yes we've won the first phase but the battle for the soul
[08:45.720 --> 08:54.120]  of humanity has just begun but Obama and Hillary and Soros he were losers from
[08:54.120 --> 09:07.800]  the day you were born
[09:07.800 --> 09:15.840]  this is the heart of 1776 it's also what happens when you listen to the
[09:15.840 --> 09:37.160]  radio host Alex Jones it's been a cozy relationship from the beginning I will
[09:37.160 --> 09:50.000]  not let you down this means the Donald Trump will be the 45th president of the
[09:50.000 --> 09:59.760]  United States waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones ladies and gentlemen we
[09:59.760 --> 10:06.720]  are live on this Wednesday the 12th day of April 2017 the world is at the
[10:06.720 --> 10:13.080]  greatest danger in its history of all human life being destroyed and that's a
[10:13.080 --> 10:16.720]  very conservative statement I'm going to go over a lot of mainline analysts
[10:16.720 --> 10:21.480]  saying the exact same thing right now so we should all be praying hourly for
[10:21.480 --> 10:27.160]  peace on earth and for a human awakening to help precarious our
[10:27.160 --> 10:30.920]  existence is now that we have such incredible technology like hydrogen
[10:30.920 --> 10:39.600]  weapons fission fusion antimatter particle accelerating cyclotrons
[10:39.600 --> 10:49.920]  weaponized space platforms biological warfare race specific weapons we're
[10:49.920 --> 10:53.520]  gonna be breaking it all down we've also got good news meadows revives
[10:53.520 --> 10:57.400]  health care negotiations confident republicans will pass bill maybe for
[10:57.400 --> 11:03.840]  recess and a good one at that we have bombshell exclusive at info wars com by
[11:03.840 --> 11:10.120]  dr. Jerome Corsi he's joining us at the bottom of the hour exclusive Obama
[11:10.120 --> 11:15.680]  wiretap Trump insiders not just the one person they are admitting to their only
[11:15.680 --> 11:19.960]  going after him Carter Page because he's the only person that even visited
[11:19.960 --> 11:26.600]  Moscow gave a speech basically pushing his own energy business never even met
[11:26.600 --> 11:32.800]  with Trump but that's all they've got they were spying on everyone ladies and
[11:32.800 --> 11:35.320]  gentlemen that's why they admit in congressional testimony a month ago that
[11:35.320 --> 11:40.280]  I am quote under FBI investigation for actually being directed by the Russians
[11:40.280 --> 11:52.400]  that is so insulting and outrageous when you know that the Democrats Hillary the
[11:52.400 --> 11:57.320]  Podesta brothers are under Russian funding I mean up to their eyeballs and
[11:57.320 --> 12:02.480]  then bankroll by the chai comms I mean just chai comms are using them as meat
[12:02.480 --> 12:13.680]  puppets so that is absolutely mind-blowing and then they're saying
[12:13.680 --> 12:18.000]  Carter patient doing anything wrong but he did go to Moscow and he did give a
[12:18.000 --> 12:22.160]  speech oh my gosh he talked to Russians that that's just not allowed to do that
[12:22.160 --> 12:27.800]  the Democrats can all meet with him constantly and we're getting into all
[12:27.800 --> 12:31.920]  that today and Adam Schiff the Democrat Ranking Member on the House
[12:31.920 --> 12:35.840]  Intelligence Committee who leaked classified info to say they had evidence
[12:35.840 --> 12:39.360]  of Trump including with the Russians there is no evidence so now he wants to
[12:39.360 --> 12:42.280]  back it up and they're saying you should recuse yourself from the committee you
[12:42.280 --> 12:45.880]  said Nunes couldn't go meet with the president and discuss intelligence and
[12:45.880 --> 12:49.320]  then back the president up that he was under surveillance which of course the
[12:49.320 --> 12:52.840]  intelligence head could do when the Democrats are running around politicizing
[12:52.840 --> 12:56.520]  everything but Nunes says I'm gonna recuse myself while the ethics committee
[12:56.520 --> 13:01.680]  looks at this and then Schiff goes 50 times further not just putting out
[13:01.680 --> 13:11.680]  intelligence but lying about it lying about it his dirty party who've had
[13:11.680 --> 13:16.880]  their nose in the Russian but forever makes me sick and then he won't recuse
[13:16.880 --> 13:23.040]  himself and I'm not even personally mad at people like Schiff and all this I'm
[13:23.040 --> 13:29.040]  just sick of them but when you're actually I used to tell Roger stop getting
[13:29.040 --> 13:32.480]  so upset they're calling you a Russian agent it's ridiculous and you get really
[13:32.480 --> 13:37.160]  mad even in person about it and and quite frankly I've been Roger pretty good
[13:37.160 --> 13:41.120]  for a few years now he will start cussing and then I realize why I got mad and
[13:41.120 --> 13:43.880]  started having I guess Tourette syndrome or something a few weeks ago about it
[13:43.880 --> 13:51.200]  because it's just having somebody accuse you of being disloyal to the country
[13:51.200 --> 13:59.880]  you love when their party is full of scumbags that are globalist and
[13:59.880 --> 14:08.040]  globalism's fundamental precept is that it destroys nation-states and sells out
[14:08.040 --> 14:16.680]  the people it's a hyper predatory global corporate crony capitalist nightmare
[14:16.680 --> 14:23.320]  of poverty by design for the general public I mean it's just they're
[14:23.320 --> 14:32.520]  unspeakably bad people whether they love globalism or whether mercenaries or just
[14:32.520 --> 14:43.720]  what power all I know is it's outrageously uncool I mean I'm known in the
[14:43.720 --> 14:51.960]  media for 20 years as a super patriot as an absolute nationalist just Tasmanian
[14:51.960 --> 14:56.920]  devil when it comes to defending our Republic and they've got the nerve to
[14:56.920 --> 15:01.800]  criminally investigate me oh they say oh you're too stupid to know how they
[15:01.800 --> 15:06.800]  influence you as if I can't have free speech and not want to back Al Qaeda
[15:06.800 --> 15:11.240]  going in to Syria and killing hundreds of thousands of people doesn't mean I
[15:11.240 --> 15:15.640]  like Assad and so they tell Rand Paul you're a Russian agent on the Senate
[15:15.640 --> 15:20.920]  floor McCain doesn't get in trouble violates the rules you're a Russian
[15:20.920 --> 15:27.400]  agent and I'll tell you presidential material right there because Senator
[15:27.400 --> 15:30.840]  Paul just turned his back and walked off I would have started probably yelling at
[15:30.840 --> 15:34.680]  McCain like what is your problem by the way we got to put somebody on an
[15:34.680 --> 15:39.560]  airplane a congressman's on his deathbed and wants to spill the beans and I have
[15:39.560 --> 15:44.240]  all this intel it's super dangerous and I just been so busy do I want to watch
[15:44.240 --> 15:48.320]  somebody today we've got limited crew and I don't want to send our best camera
[15:48.320 --> 15:53.400]  people but I've just got to do it so just find out who wants to go I'll always
[15:53.400 --> 15:56.280]  make somebody go to it but I like to know who wants to go and they'll do this
[15:56.280 --> 16:03.400]  deathbed interview because he could die any minute and we're under total
[16:03.400 --> 16:05.960]  surveillance and we need to get this out because it's too dangerous not to get it
[16:05.960 --> 16:13.240]  out so she probably sent somebody whoever goes and look I didn't ask you
[16:13.240 --> 16:16.920]  know ever get in this position I just thought I'd expose the globalist other
[16:16.920 --> 16:19.800]  people would stand up and beat them and Trump and others are starting to do that
[16:19.800 --> 16:23.920]  but I am now in the position I mean put it this way I never thought I'd be in
[16:23.920 --> 16:29.160]  this position and it's crazy but America and the world is in this position so
[16:29.160 --> 16:32.040]  we're going to go over the World War three news the economic news the
[16:32.040 --> 16:37.720]  Obamacare news and this big exclusive bombshell Obama wiretap Trump and
[16:37.720 --> 16:41.640]  Siders that's come up the bottom of the hour Dr. Jerome Corsi incredible
[16:41.640 --> 16:44.840]  investigative journalist broken hundreds of top national news stories three
[16:44.840 --> 16:53.920]  number one New York Times bestsellers political non fiction admittedly change
[16:53.920 --> 16:57.080]  the outcome of a major election but the point is is that you know he's a very
[16:57.080 --> 17:04.120]  credible person his sources are in the CIA FBI or unparalleled but the point is
[17:04.120 --> 17:07.520]  is this is all documented information remember on Monday remember on Sunday I
[17:07.520 --> 17:11.080]  do this because the media says we're not real we just keep throwing it in their
[17:11.080 --> 17:14.520]  face that we are that's why they want to get rid of us because they can't let
[17:14.520 --> 17:20.840]  this spread White House source Trump pushes back against neocon plan to
[17:20.840 --> 17:24.760]  invade Syria says there will not be boots on the ground changing regime or
[17:24.760 --> 17:33.840]  there will not be a no-fly zone but that Assad could not be allowed to have
[17:33.840 --> 17:36.920]  those chemicals and he'd agreed to give them up and they didn't and Trump had
[17:36.920 --> 17:40.480]  intel of the chemicals on the ground and it looks like the containers of the
[17:40.480 --> 17:43.760]  chemicals we know Syria had that's what the president really thinks that's what
[17:43.760 --> 17:50.600]  he did he's been having to get Haley and others to you know dial it back they've
[17:50.600 --> 17:54.680]  been doing that so has the Secretary of State but it's not a double message on
[17:54.680 --> 17:58.160]  purpose his people are all bullied by neocons they want to be loved by the
[17:58.160 --> 18:01.680]  liberal media they don't want to be called Russian agents and so they're
[18:01.680 --> 18:09.600]  going along with it so I'll play a clip from a show Monday and the article we
[18:09.600 --> 18:13.640]  should have just bragged and said it was directly from the president I mean
[18:13.640 --> 18:16.040]  this is word for word what the president said that's why it's word for
[18:16.040 --> 18:22.200]  word what you heard on Fox business last night word for word and I'm not
[18:22.200 --> 18:27.480]  going to get into our sources let's just say they're close to Trump now let's go
[18:27.480 --> 18:35.880]  ahead and play that clip from Monday these areas all Joseph Watson has in
[18:35.880 --> 18:41.160]  his article on info wars.com Trump pushes back against neocon plan to invade
[18:41.160 --> 18:46.040]  Syria and I rarely agree with CNN but here's the headline from CNN
[18:46.040 --> 18:52.440]  Trump administration sends mixed signals on Syria ahead of g7 meeting boy they
[18:52.440 --> 18:58.400]  said it was George Washington trained by the greatest empire on earth at the
[18:58.400 --> 19:01.680]  time who said no foreign entanglements let's have our own wealth our own
[19:01.680 --> 19:05.040]  country because these foreign wars don't even help the people they help the
[19:05.040 --> 19:08.320]  elites and are more trouble than they're worth he didn't even say that from some
[19:08.320 --> 19:11.800]  moral position even though he was a very moral man he said it from a very
[19:11.800 --> 19:19.320]  informed educated system and he launched the American system now by 1898 with
[19:19.320 --> 19:23.040]  William McKinley and again that's the start of the show date after on Monday
[19:23.040 --> 19:26.400]  and then I read through the article and go over it all and it's right there when

[24:16.280 --> 24:21.680]  but where I first got into the exclusive article that went up on Monday
[24:21.680 --> 24:27.000]  morning at info wars dot com White House source Trump pushes back against
[24:27.000 --> 24:31.200]  neocon plan to invade Syria said he's not gonna have a no-fly zone and doesn't
[24:31.200 --> 24:34.920]  want a wider war there now we have the headline today from the Hill the
[24:34.920 --> 24:38.920]  Associated Press you name it we're not going into Syria from Fox Business last
[24:38.920 --> 24:44.920]  night now why is this so important just what I was saying earlier the media
[24:44.920 --> 24:48.920]  claims that I don't have an original thought in my head and everything comes
[24:48.920 --> 24:54.200]  from Russia or from some foreign government we're the ones that broke and
[24:54.200 --> 25:00.040]  exposed three plus years ago and last year first the jihadis on their own
[25:00.040 --> 25:04.520]  websites were bragging that they fired the chemicals at their own population to
[25:04.520 --> 25:10.040]  blame it on Assad and make Obama cross the red line and come in so they were
[25:10.040 --> 25:14.840]  crossing it for Assad that's been in the UN that's been on the BBC that's
[25:14.840 --> 25:21.000]  been on ABC Nightly News that all came out they have the Economist magazine one
[25:21.000 --> 25:29.160]  of the most elite publications in the world coming out saying how a pair of
[25:29.160 --> 25:34.160]  self publicists that just means self-promoters wound up as apologists
[25:34.160 --> 25:40.400]  for Assad and it says that we're being directed by Assad but that we're useful
[25:40.400 --> 25:47.840]  idiots that's the top headline that's an old Soviet term a VI Lenin term you I'm
[25:47.840 --> 25:53.200]  a useful idiot ladies and gentlemen I don't even read Arabic I don't even
[25:53.200 --> 26:00.800]  look at yeah sites in Syria maybe twice a year or something I go to the rebel
[26:00.800 --> 26:06.200]  zone websites where they're bragging about what they do we had colonels and
[26:06.200 --> 26:12.280]  generals and the inside and CIA contractors exposing what happened in
[26:12.280 --> 26:17.720]  Benghazi I've had canto on repeatedly you know one of the heroes of Benghazi we
[26:17.720 --> 26:24.520]  go directly to the people we don't go to Assad in fact it came out in the London
[26:24.520 --> 26:28.920]  Independent five years ago that Assad goes when they hacked his email and its
[26:28.920 --> 26:34.880]  info wars and he's reading what we say not the other way around the Russians
[26:34.880 --> 26:39.480]  read what I say not the other way around and I'm not bragging I'm just sick of
[26:39.480 --> 26:44.480]  this I've pro-generated the entire info wars movement against the globalist we
[26:44.480 --> 26:49.040]  launched this entire operation against them I am an American I am an original
[26:49.040 --> 26:54.880]  thinker par excellence oh but the economists with their pseudo-intellectual
[26:54.880 --> 27:04.800]  around go oh look at Alex Jones he just got it from from the Easter Bunny just
[27:04.800 --> 27:13.320]  like I talked to our White House source Sunday and I even called some of the
[27:13.320 --> 27:24.860]  crew and said good news my source my source says we're not gonna have an
[27:24.860 --> 27:28.680]  off-line zone and we're not going to take out Assad but he has agreed to step
[27:28.680 --> 27:33.840]  down four years ago and there were chemicals on the ground so what am I
[27:33.840 --> 27:37.940]  supposed to do about that Alex well what are all the ground forces there can't
[27:37.940 --> 27:42.520]  talk about that but we're not going to have a big war over there and we're not
[27:42.520 --> 27:48.720]  planning to overthrow Assad now that's what somebody that talked to Trump told
[27:48.720 --> 27:53.080]  me we'll just leave it at that and here it is word for word like I said oh well
[27:53.080 --> 27:57.320]  the economists say I got that from Damascus when Ron Paul and Rand Paul
[27:57.320 --> 28:00.560]  come out and the British ambassador comes out and says the same thing and
[28:00.560 --> 28:04.960]  Michael Savage says it and I'm not toot my horn but I said it all first on
[28:04.960 --> 28:10.960]  Wednesday and our reporters said it first and our correspondence who've
[28:10.960 --> 28:19.400]  lived in Syria but Syrian girl lives in Australia and the point is is that we're
[28:19.400 --> 28:23.240]  just saying they've launched chemical attacks before why in 101 game theory
[28:23.240 --> 28:27.120]  like Cernovich said would you attack using this knowing it bring in the
[28:27.120 --> 28:32.240]  United States why it's the dumbest thing I've ever heard but see I can't have an
[28:32.240 --> 28:36.160]  original thought I'm being directed by the Russians and they're having house
[28:36.160 --> 28:40.800]  intelligence and armed services committee hearings saying I'm directed by
[28:40.800 --> 28:46.880]  them no judge no jury I don't get to go to those hearings I want to go right now
[28:46.880 --> 28:53.040]  I want to be able to defend myself from you jerks you lying un-American dirt
[28:53.040 --> 28:58.640]  bags you attack my honor when all I want is prosperity for this country in the
[28:58.640 --> 29:02.080]  world and you run your evil mouths you're a bunch of trash excuse I'm not
[29:02.080 --> 29:06.440]  gonna get angry I'm gonna come back play all the clips we've got the clip they
[29:06.440 --> 29:09.560]  found it great job crew I just from cutting into the show Monday where I
[29:09.560 --> 29:13.800]  broke it down one of many times but I sit here to the break and I read this
[29:13.800 --> 29:19.160]  stupid article and see it's like this is why we have to shut down info wars and
[29:19.160 --> 29:23.280]  the and the alternative media and the alt-right because they they're directed
[29:23.280 --> 29:32.120]  by far by Assad oh my oh and and the pseudo-intellectuals you see reading the
[29:32.120 --> 29:35.480]  economists on airplanes and acting like they're getting some big important
[29:35.480 --> 29:40.120]  powerful news last time I checked it was like published it owned in part by
[29:40.120 --> 29:46.040]  in him Rothschild the biggest warmongering people you know you can
[29:46.040 --> 29:53.520]  ever imagine it's a sick we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones
[29:53.520 --> 29:57.480]  and the GCN radio network
[29:59.920 --> 30:06.040]  Russian President Vladimir Putin says the Syria chemical attack was a false
[30:06.040 --> 30:12.880]  flag and more are on the way we have information from various sources that a
[30:12.880 --> 30:17.160]  similar provocation and I can't call it anything other than a provocation is
[30:17.160 --> 30:21.480]  being prepared in other parts of Syria including the southern suburbs of
[30:21.480 --> 30:27.000]  Damascus where they're again prepared to lease some similar chemical substances
[30:27.000 --> 30:31.280]  and accuse the Syrian authorities of using them Putin went on to compare the
[30:31.280 --> 30:36.600]  situation in Syria to Saddam Hussein's non-existence weapons of mass
[30:36.600 --> 30:41.720]  destruction which may indicate that he believes the US is either behind the
[30:41.720 --> 30:46.520]  false flag or actively pushing the propaganda meanwhile the Russian
[30:46.520 --> 30:52.160]  government says Syrian forces possess no chemical weapons and any further attacks
[30:52.160 --> 30:57.600]  in Syria by the United States will be unacceptable you can learn more right

[33:38.520 --> 33:44.680]  gonna go down as George W. Bush and I'm not gonna start World War three but they

[33:57.400 --> 34:00.480]  up and the Russians were supposed to fly them out or incinerate them what are
[34:00.480 --> 34:06.760]  they doing there now you saw Trump last night on Fox Business say all that word
[34:06.760 --> 34:10.360]  for word and everybody knows we talk to president sometimes we have sources to
[34:10.360 --> 34:13.680]  talk to him basically every day and it's not just Roger Stone he is one of the
[34:13.680 --> 34:17.080]  sources I call to double check stuff with but I'm gonna leave it at that
[34:17.080 --> 34:24.760]  because he doesn't want to be quoted on these particular areas but the point is
[34:24.760 --> 34:29.720]  they're calling us fake news everywhere because we're the opposite we're about to
[34:29.720 --> 34:34.080]  go to Dr. Jerome Corsi who's got three number one New York Times best-selling
[34:34.080 --> 34:38.600]  books changed at least one election is credited for winning George W. Bush's
[34:38.600 --> 34:43.320]  second election the point is that he's very effective as a sources he has the
[34:43.320 --> 34:48.120]  intel bombshell exclusive info wars.com Obama wiretap Trump insiders this is
[34:48.120 --> 34:52.360]  huge we're gonna break down all this in a second but I want to go to these clips
[34:52.360 --> 34:56.520]  here I am Monday cover also covered at Sunday covering the exclusive article
[34:56.520 --> 35:00.160]  that's got paragraph after paragraph that are quotes and I didn't really want
[35:00.160 --> 35:03.640]  to say these were direct quotes to the president here because the media has such
[35:03.640 --> 35:07.600]  a circus with it but then at the same time you know this is real stuff from
[35:07.600 --> 35:12.800]  the president on Syria on a lot of big issues so people actually know where he
[35:12.800 --> 35:19.600]  stands so you'll now notice word for word what we tell you here is what he
[35:19.600 --> 35:23.360]  then says two days later the media keeps saying he must be getting it all
[35:23.360 --> 35:26.840]  from info wars it's the other way around we're talking to the president or our
[35:26.840 --> 35:30.560]  sources are and I talked to another source last night that's in regular
[35:30.560 --> 35:34.320]  contact with the president as well and I'm gonna leave it at that and we have a
[35:34.320 --> 35:38.560]  lot of sources folks and a lot of people that play golf with the president
[35:38.560 --> 35:42.480]  people that are in the White House people that are longtime friends and
[35:42.480 --> 35:47.680]  other things and Trump wants this info to get out and he knows the media
[35:47.680 --> 35:55.520]  distorts it so I'm just gonna leave it at that and look at China now having to
[35:55.520 --> 35:58.840]  back off and saying they'll back even a strike on North Korea if they do
[35:58.840 --> 36:02.080]  something in fact China says they'll go in well notice that's what Trump said
[36:02.080 --> 36:06.160]  weeks ago they'll get North Korea under control or I will so now they're turned
[36:06.160 --> 36:09.680]  back their ships they're not letting them sell their coal to China and their
[36:09.680 --> 36:13.960]  major people's daily said if you attack the United States without a
[36:13.960 --> 36:17.760]  provocation or Japan or anybody else we're gonna take you out because you're
[36:17.760 --> 36:22.480]  crossing our bottom line five out of the Chinese are you know into business
[36:22.480 --> 36:27.240]  the paradox their comments but they're good business people so that's what's
[36:27.240 --> 36:30.880]  happening here and but everything is how we're dupes we're idiots we don't know
[36:30.880 --> 36:34.320]  anything everything we say is fake on and on and on all these red herrings and I
[36:34.320 --> 36:39.120]  know you know we're for real but folks have to understand how hardcore and how
[36:39.120 --> 36:43.960]  precious info wars is that's why we're the main target of attack now let's go
[36:43.960 --> 36:47.040]  to the clip from Monday then I'll get to the clip of the president here it is
[36:47.040 --> 36:51.560]  there's a report I've got directly out of the White House and other sources that
[36:51.560 --> 36:55.200]  in these meetings Trump saying I'm not put up a no-fly zone I don't intend to
[36:55.200 --> 36:59.160]  escalate this and I don't have the generals bossing me around we've got
[36:59.160 --> 37:03.400]  that force there to protect our ground troops as they kick ISIS and Al Qaeda out
[37:03.400 --> 37:08.520]  of the country we intend to end the civil war that threatens all of Europe
[37:08.520 --> 37:12.220]  because if that country falls to a hobbyist then we already have Turkey
[37:12.220 --> 37:15.120]  linking up with them calling for jahads in Europe they'll have a direct
[37:15.120 --> 37:18.540]  invasion route into Europe and we'll have the jahads that started the
[37:18.540 --> 37:24.400]  crusades all over again this is exclusive information Paul Joseph Watson
[37:24.400 --> 37:29.320]  has in his article on them four wars calm and see at first I wasn't even put
[37:29.320 --> 37:31.880]  my name on it because I don't want to create a big controversy this is a
[37:31.880 --> 37:34.240]  direct conduit to the White House because obviously I want to keep that
[37:34.240 --> 37:37.880]  conduit open they've got all my phones tapped they know all this that's why
[37:37.880 --> 37:40.360]  they say I'm under criminal investigation by the FBI for being
[37:40.360 --> 37:45.080]  actually a Russian agent remember that a month ago in Congress in hearings with
[37:45.080 --> 37:47.920]  no proof and I can't go face them in there so they can tell the president
[37:47.920 --> 37:51.640]  don't talk to you know Alex Jones or don't talk to this person because they're
[37:51.640 --> 37:54.920]  they're under Russian investigation then you get the internal media matters
[37:54.920 --> 37:58.920]  reports they're like we got to take out Roger Stone he's an MVP he's gonna help
[37:58.920 --> 38:03.280]  Trump win we got to call him a Russian agent you know we got to get him kicked
[38:03.280 --> 38:06.040]  off all the news channels and it's in their memos it's in their recordings
[38:06.040 --> 38:10.640]  it's it's all come out that we've got to stop these people we've got to stop his
[38:10.640 --> 38:15.560]  base we've got to get him cut off from them so here is Trump last night on
[38:15.560 --> 38:20.120]  Fox Business there's several clips but here is the president saying word for
[38:20.120 --> 38:24.560]  word what is in the article that we wrote much of it a direct transcript of
[38:24.560 --> 38:28.360]  what the president said here it is then we're not going into Syria because you
[38:28.360 --> 38:31.520]  know there were some questions Nikki Halley is doing a great job Rex is
[38:31.520 --> 38:37.440]  doing a fantastic job our Secretary of State a General McMaster fantastic but
[38:37.440 --> 38:40.520]  if you add it all up and if they take every little word they'll say oh they're
[38:40.520 --> 38:45.280]  different just so you understand we're not going into Syria but when I see
[38:45.280 --> 38:52.680]  people using horrible horrible chemical weapons which they agreed not to use
[38:52.680 --> 38:57.600]  under the Obama administration but they violated it they said they got rid of
[38:57.600 --> 39:03.360]  them look what I did should have been done by the Obama administration a long
[39:03.360 --> 39:07.120]  time before I did it and you would have had a much better I think Syria would be
[39:07.120 --> 39:11.080]  a lot better off right now than it has been see what Trump does is he hits
[39:11.080 --> 39:14.360]  somebody militarily and then tells you I did it he doesn't telegraph the strike
[39:14.360 --> 39:18.880]  first word for word Sunday on the show I broke it down they pull the transcript
[39:18.880 --> 39:22.720]  he did an article on Monday word for word White House source Trump pushes back
[39:22.720 --> 39:26.920]  against neoconplanned invade Syria and it says his rationale was they agree to
[39:26.920 --> 39:29.800]  give up the chemicals and whether they use them or not they had intel on the
[39:29.800 --> 39:34.080]  ground from special forces and others including journalists of giant stockpiles
[39:34.080 --> 39:36.840]  of it just sitting out there at the airfields now you can argue and say
[39:36.840 --> 39:40.440]  that's not what it is and I'm not even pushing for these strikes but look how
[39:40.440 --> 39:46.760]  I got the Chinese debacle for the first time since the Korean War in 1953 that
[39:46.760 --> 39:51.280]  ceasefire is saying we will hit North Korea if they start a fight US you stay
[39:51.280 --> 39:54.680]  out of it we'll hit them wow then they can hit them we don't have a nuclear
[39:54.680 --> 39:58.720]  war because North Korea is out of control and is threatening everybody so you
[39:58.720 --> 40:01.560]  can see what Trump's doing and here's the deal it's not globalist doing it it's
[40:01.560 --> 40:05.760]  nationalist it's America didn't didn't say once we got an American president he'd
[40:05.760 --> 40:10.240]  be absolutely you know like your pastor like like Phyllis Schlafly would always
[40:10.240 --> 40:15.520]  say but he's got the world's respect he's turning our economy back on and he
[40:15.520 --> 40:19.400]  does not intend to have a water war he's saying I've got to clean up Obama's
[40:19.400 --> 40:23.560]  mess or it's gonna become a wider war and he's got to control the generals not
[40:23.560 --> 40:27.400]  getting a water war they always want that don't they but that's word for word
[40:27.400 --> 40:32.320]  another thing I'm gonna clean up Obama's mess or it's gonna flood Europe
[40:32.320 --> 40:37.640]  that's what Trump's doing so you know in hindsight and I've been critical but six
[40:37.640 --> 40:42.080]  days later seven days later coming into focus what the president did coming
[40:42.080 --> 40:45.160]  into focus what the president did and there's several other clips where he
[40:45.160 --> 40:49.340]  talks about China I'm gonna play those they go to Dr. Jerome Corsi setting up
[40:49.340 --> 40:54.480]  we got our offices now he's getting all that together they're in DC let's go
[40:54.480 --> 40:59.440]  ahead and go to the next clip Trump and Chinese president agree on solutions for
[40:59.440 --> 41:03.560]  North Korea this is from the same interview here it is was North Korea
[41:03.560 --> 41:07.720]  so you gotta help us with North Korea because we can't allow it and it's no
[41:07.720 --> 41:11.640]  good for you and you have a tremendous power because of trade now he then
[41:11.640 --> 41:16.960]  explains thousands of years of history with Korea not that easy in other words
[41:16.960 --> 41:21.320]  not as simple as people would think they've had tremendous conflict with
[41:21.320 --> 41:26.640]  Korea over the years now his father was in China four times he was never in
[41:26.640 --> 41:32.760]  China so I said look you have a tremendous power because of trading
[41:32.760 --> 41:36.600]  through the border they don't get food they don't get you know they can't sell
[41:36.600 --> 41:40.680]  their coal in fact I hear today two massive coal ships from North Korea
[41:40.680 --> 41:45.520]  was sent back to North Korea heading to China they were sent back which is a
[41:45.520 --> 41:50.160]  very good sign but I think China can help us I hope China can help us we
[41:50.160 --> 41:54.080]  talked about trade and I can tell you China will do much better on trade if
[41:54.080 --> 41:58.520]  they help us with North and you think he knows that I think he knows that I told
[41:58.520 --> 42:05.960]  him that yeah when you were with so see this is all deals that are direct they
[42:05.960 --> 42:08.680]  aren't run by these globalist combines where presidents are supposed to sit
[42:08.680 --> 42:11.920]  there and wait while policy boards tell them what to do and the North Korea
[42:11.920 --> 42:15.440]  keeps arming keeps getting more nukes keeps threatening the world China gets
[42:15.440 --> 42:18.680]  more belligerent and all of a sudden China's starting to pull back and
[42:18.680 --> 42:22.640]  realizing listen you can't just push us around we dropped atomic bombs on
[42:22.640 --> 42:27.800]  Japan we're not playing games okay the West is back we will kill you if you
[42:27.800 --> 42:32.200]  start a fight now the danger of having this much power and America having its
[42:32.200 --> 42:36.600]  power again not the globalist is that we could get a little little little
[42:36.600 --> 42:40.440]  heady and a little belligerent and those the gods would destroy they first
[42:40.440 --> 42:44.120]  make man I've got one more clip they're going to Dr. Corsi with this big breaking
[42:44.120 --> 42:49.160]  news this is a Trump on telling Chinese president about Syria airstrikes here it
[42:49.160 --> 42:54.440]  is it finished in or we're now having dessert and we had the most beautiful
[42:54.440 --> 43:00.000]  piece of chocolate cake that you've ever seen and president she was enjoying it
[43:00.000 --> 43:08.440]  and I was given the message from the generals that the ships are locked and
[43:08.440 --> 43:13.760]  loaded what do you do and we made a determination to do so the missiles were
[43:13.760 --> 43:19.880]  on the way and I said mr. president let me explain something to you this is
[43:19.880 --> 43:26.440]  during dessert we've just fired 59 missiles all of which hit by the way
[43:26.440 --> 43:32.400]  unbelievable from you know hundreds of miles away all of which hit on man it's
[43:32.400 --> 43:36.240]  so incredible it's brilliant it's genius our technology our equipment is better
[43:36.240 --> 43:40.760]  than anybody body by a factor of five I mean what we have in terms of
[43:40.760 --> 43:45.640]  technology nobody can go 30 years old to competing now we're going to start
[43:45.640 --> 43:49.720]  getting it because you know the military has been cut back and depleted so
[43:49.720 --> 43:53.920]  badly by the past administration and by the war in Iraq which was another
[43:53.920 --> 44:01.160]  disaster so what happens is I said we've just launched 59 missiles heading to
[44:01.160 --> 44:06.920]  Iraq well you headed to Syria yes heading toward Syria and I want you to
[44:06.920 --> 44:09.920]  know that because I didn't want to go home we're almost finished was a full

[44:18.480 --> 44:25.320]  attacked how did he react so he paused for 10 seconds and then he asked the
[44:25.320 --> 44:30.320]  interpreter to please say it again I didn't think that was a good sign and he
[44:30.320 --> 44:39.560]  said to me anybody that uses gases you could almost say or anything else but
[44:39.560 --> 44:46.560]  anybody that was so brutal and uses gases to do that to young children and
[44:46.560 --> 44:53.920]  babies it's okay he agreed he was okay with it he was okay it was all done
[44:53.920 --> 44:58.480]  personally that's what Trump does now Dr. Corsi this all ties together has big
[44:58.480 --> 45:02.800]  breaking news on info wars.com Dr. Jerome Corsi also longtime friend of
[45:02.800 --> 45:06.760]  Donald Trump as well so he has that all back around Obama wiretapped Trump
[45:06.760 --> 45:12.280]  insiders that's an exclusive FISA order targeted Trump Center Circle not just
[45:12.280 --> 45:16.920]  Carter Page who they've got some tenuous Russian connection so they're only
[45:16.920 --> 45:21.840]  letting that come out now because they have nothing and now chef on the
[45:21.840 --> 45:25.480]  intelligence committee the Democrat he won't recuse himself even though he's
[45:25.480 --> 45:30.120]  putting out fake intel which is illegal just put out intel period he won't
[45:30.120 --> 45:33.640]  recuse himself this is just unbelievable so we have this big breaking news and
[45:33.640 --> 45:39.480]  all ties together with it coming out the CIA has been spoofing Russian and other
[45:39.480 --> 45:44.000]  systems and attacking Congress you name it to get more power so Dr. Jerome
[45:44.000 --> 45:47.360]  Corsi an expert by the way on cybersecurity as well and banking's
[45:47.360 --> 45:50.800]  his real real calling State Department Consultant you name it but all over the
[45:50.800 --> 45:56.080]  world he you know he's here to break down how big this story is and what it ties
[45:56.080 --> 45:59.680]  into they have national polls were close to 60% of Americans think Obama
[45:59.680 --> 46:05.400]  illegally spied well it's not think it's all admitted that's why they've been
[46:05.400 --> 46:10.040]  stonewalling okay it because they first admitted they done it to say they had
[46:10.040 --> 46:13.160]  this intel but there was no intel so then Trump goes that's illegal they go we
[46:13.160 --> 46:16.720]  never said that we have all the front pages of the newspapers and their sources
[46:16.720 --> 46:21.320]  so see put up or shut up show where I'm this Russian agent they're in the the
[46:21.320 --> 46:25.920]  economists today saying I'm being directed by Damascus what a load of
[46:25.920 --> 46:34.120]  horsemen are let's go to let's go to Dr. Jerome Corsi doc you've got the floor
[46:34.120 --> 46:39.800]  break this big nose well Alex the the news is that the wiretapping order the
[46:39.800 --> 46:45.200]  fights to order that placed electronic surveillance on Kyder page which now has
[46:45.200 --> 46:50.360]  been confirmed we know that happened during the election so this is where
[46:50.360 --> 46:55.600]  tapping during the election was also the same fights to order was used against
[46:55.600 --> 47:00.680]  Paul Manafort who was formerly Trump's campaign manager and Roger Stone the
[47:00.680 --> 47:06.200]  longtime Trump political advisor and just like you've been reporting I mean we
[47:06.200 --> 47:13.680]  went back to the New York Times on January 19th 2017 this year and in that
[47:13.680 --> 47:17.960]  newspaper there were four reporters and they said that you know intercepted
[47:17.960 --> 47:23.480]  Russian communications were part of the inquiry into Trump associates so even
[47:23.480 --> 47:28.520]  the White House had already linked leaked to the New York Times that it was
[47:28.520 --> 47:33.560]  doing electronic surveillance of Trump associates which include the highest
[47:33.560 --> 47:39.280]  levels you know Manafort and Stone and the question is of course whether any
[47:39.280 --> 47:44.000]  of our Donald Trump's conversations were captured which almost certainly they
[47:44.000 --> 47:50.720]  had to be and also the New York Times revealed in that January 19th that
[47:50.720 --> 47:56.480]  article that the wiretapping the FISA ordered electronic surveillance of
[47:56.480 --> 48:04.240]  Carter page Paul Manafort and Roger Stone was being directed by the FBI but
[48:04.240 --> 48:10.280]  aided by the National Security Agency NSA and the CIA and the Treasury
[48:10.280 --> 48:15.920]  Department's Financial Crimes Unit and the information had been shared with the
[48:15.920 --> 48:21.360]  White House so this is very broad sharing of exactly what Trump said that
[48:21.360 --> 48:26.200]  there was electronic surveillance of Trump and his top associates during the
[48:26.200 --> 48:30.760]  campaign again Donald Trump's right it was right there in front of us but now
[48:30.760 --> 48:36.360]  when the Carter page story breaks we find that it was also the same FISA
[48:36.360 --> 48:41.880]  order that was used against Manafort and Stone this this reveals the entire lie
[48:41.880 --> 48:48.080]  at the at the core of the Obama administration's denial that there had
[48:48.080 --> 48:53.000]  been wiretapping of presidential candidate and then President-elect
[48:53.000 --> 48:58.840]  Trump which obviously now we know there has been and I mean it's shocking to
[48:58.840 --> 49:03.080]  think that President Obama was wiretapping his opponent and who knows
[49:03.080 --> 49:09.080]  if the information was shared with Hillary Clinton please continue breaking
[49:09.080 --> 49:12.120]  down I mean the different angles of this because this is just massive that
[49:12.120 --> 49:15.080]  they've been caught lying the whole time about this and then more and more is
[49:15.080 --> 49:19.520]  coming out well and to break it down further I mean what it means is that
[49:19.520 --> 49:24.560]  this whole Russian I think this whole Russian angle was a pretext I mean
[49:24.560 --> 49:30.640]  first of all Carter page is a businessman he was a junior former policy
[49:30.640 --> 49:34.880]  advisor to the campaign he never had a single meeting in person with Donald
[49:34.880 --> 49:39.560]  Trump and yet when the wiretapping of this electronic surveillance properly the
[49:39.560 --> 49:45.840]  order went through the FISA court it looks like the FBI tagged on a Paul
[49:45.840 --> 49:51.920]  Manafort and Roger Stone now that immediately allows the FBI and all
[49:51.920 --> 49:58.080]  these other agencies NSA CIA Treasury the Financial Crimes Unit to be collecting
[49:58.080 --> 50:02.720]  information during the campaign and during the transition about candidate
[50:02.720 --> 50:06.400]  Trump and then President-elect Trump now this information I mean first of all
[50:06.400 --> 50:12.040]  it's unprecedented in American history that you would wiretap or do electronic
[50:12.040 --> 50:17.520]  surveillance on an opponent I mean this this is Watergate on steroids I mean it's
[50:17.520 --> 50:19.960]  beyond that we're about to go to break let's come back and talk about that I
[50:19.960 --> 50:23.520]  also got told by a White House source and it came out the next day that Nancy
[50:23.520 --> 50:26.360]  Pelosi said that I threatened her daughter but I never threatened her
[50:26.360 --> 50:32.480]  daughter who was running the whole unfaithful elector deal trying to keep
[50:32.480 --> 50:36.920]  Trump from being seated as the president on January 20th and then she went on
[50:36.920 --> 50:40.520]  Fox and said I was death-threading her and I learned they had meetings at the
[50:40.520 --> 50:45.640]  Justice Department with Lynch saying I want Alex Jones arrested Nancy Pelosi so
[50:45.640 --> 50:50.280]  I mean they are after us folks it is unbelievable they are after our free
[50:50.280 --> 50:54.200]  speech they would lock us up it's my view Nancy Pelosi would in a minute we'll

[54:19.760 --> 54:24.720]  Associated Press see sex rings everywhere and no one's getting in trouble and
[54:24.720 --> 54:27.480]  then when you bring it up they say it doesn't exist or if you correct some
[54:27.480 --> 54:30.600]  story you're working on they go oh look Joan says children have never been
[54:30.600 --> 54:34.800]  right pedophilia doesn't exist I mean that's the level in the controlled
[54:34.800 --> 54:38.720]  medium but it they can't stop it coming out I'm there's also cases down the US
[54:38.720 --> 54:44.120]  where people admittedly migrants rape people and then you point out that our
[54:44.120 --> 54:47.280]  government's importing them or companies are and then the company say we're
[54:47.280 --> 54:52.560]  going to sue you for saying we and we've imported people that then they
[54:52.560 --> 54:59.200]  themselves their children ended up raping people I mean it's just it's

[55:14.480 --> 55:18.720]  people or whatever the point is is that a lot of Islamic culture has this
[55:18.720 --> 55:22.600]  underlying and that mainstream media makes jokes about it I mean they've had
[55:22.600 --> 55:26.120]  like Colbert and others go what's a slave block Joan says women are being

[59:51.840 --> 59:57.200]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[59:57.200 --> 1:00:09.960]  the globalist great error is to believe that as they collapse humanity they end
[1:00:09.960 --> 1:00:16.200]  up on top when the truth is humanity is coming down fast but we're miles above
[1:00:16.200 --> 1:00:32.360]  you coming down fast but a miles above you all right
[1:00:32.360 --> 1:00:36.120]  that was your own course see of info wars.com is our guest with a big
[1:00:36.120 --> 1:00:41.040]  exclusive report on info wars.com they're spying on the entire Trump
[1:00:41.040 --> 1:00:44.960]  inner circle twisting the information giving it to the media it's all coming
[1:00:44.960 --> 1:00:48.600]  out the Democrats have committed something I mean thousands of times
[1:00:48.600 --> 1:00:54.760]  conservatively bigger than Watergate so Dr. Corsi where does all this go now well
[1:00:54.760 --> 1:00:58.600]  I think first of all Alex it makes it clear that the Democrats have been
[1:00:58.600 --> 1:01:04.640]  lying when they said that you know Obama had not been electronic surveillance or
[1:01:04.640 --> 1:01:09.760]  having wiretapping on the Trump campaign it's clear that it was done very
[1:01:09.760 --> 1:01:14.200]  broadly and the information was shared very broadly across the administration
[1:01:14.200 --> 1:01:17.960]  including to the White House I mean it's shocking that this information came
[1:01:17.960 --> 1:01:22.120]  to the White House and President Obama didn't order it why didn't President
[1:01:22.120 --> 1:01:26.680]  Obama say stop it we can't be you know having electronic surveillance on a
[1:01:26.680 --> 1:01:32.280]  presidential candidate or president-elect so under law of course he ordered it but
[1:01:32.280 --> 1:01:36.440]  he's responsible whether he quote new or not and rice and all of them have been
[1:01:36.440 --> 1:01:39.200]  caught lying so where do you think this is going and what should we do about it
[1:01:39.200 --> 1:01:44.160]  well I think it's going into a major crisis in terms of the finally what
[1:01:44.160 --> 1:01:47.840]  we get some of these intel committee committee's meeting I don't think the
[1:01:47.840 --> 1:01:51.040]  Democrats are going to be able to stonewall this I also think Trump's
[1:01:51.040 --> 1:01:56.560]  been very effective in defusing the whole Russian conclusion narrative the
[1:01:56.560 --> 1:02:01.920]  Democrats I mean if Trump's sending missiles into Syria he's not exactly
[1:02:01.920 --> 1:02:06.200]  engaging in a bromance with Putin and the whole narrative the Democrats have
[1:02:06.200 --> 1:02:12.040]  looks lying and silly I mean what's apparent is the Democrats concocted this
[1:02:12.040 --> 1:02:18.160]  whole Russian conclude conclusion in order to be able to to have wiretapping
[1:02:18.160 --> 1:02:23.520]  electronic surveillance on top Trump campaign officials including Manafort
[1:02:23.520 --> 1:02:28.760]  and Roger Stone and then they tried to turn it around and say well Roger Stone
[1:02:28.760 --> 1:02:33.360]  and Manafort were colluding with the Russians it was absolutely silly and
[1:02:33.360 --> 1:02:36.400]  everyone who's looked at the intelligence about Russian collusion has
[1:02:36.400 --> 1:02:39.840]  said there's nothing there that's now been admitted so where do they go we've
[1:02:39.840 --> 1:02:43.040]  got Adam Schiff of the ranking Democrat on the intelligence committee in the
[1:02:43.040 --> 1:02:47.160]  House refusing to accuse himself when he's out there blabbering that he has
[1:02:47.160 --> 1:02:51.360]  intelligence a hundred times what Nunez has done Nunez recuses himself so the
[1:02:51.360 --> 1:02:54.720]  other committee can clear him but then but Schiff just runs around like a
[1:02:54.720 --> 1:02:59.400]  maniac he the Democrats act like they're the party in power when they're not
[1:02:59.400 --> 1:03:04.120]  they're a party that got its ass kicked at the states at the legislators we have
[1:03:04.120 --> 1:03:08.640]  a trifecta in government Trump needs to prosecute these people they're the ones
[1:03:08.640 --> 1:03:12.360]  that are enemies of the Republic and it looks to me I mean this is clear with
[1:03:12.360 --> 1:03:15.520]  the leaks and everything there's been crimes committed so after the
[1:03:15.520 --> 1:03:19.800]  congressional investigations we ought to have referrals into the Department of
[1:03:19.800 --> 1:03:24.240]  Justice for a grand jury and it looks to me like our Trump when his interview
[1:03:24.240 --> 1:03:28.120]  with Maria Bartaroma on her guilty Hillary effect let's play that next
[1:03:28.120 --> 1:03:32.160]  segment guilty Hillary that's big and saying that the only reason she's not
[1:03:32.160 --> 1:03:36.920]  going through trials because of Comey well that sure sounds like Trump is
[1:03:36.920 --> 1:03:42.440]  getting ready to clean house now he needs to sack any instincts yeah you
[1:03:42.440 --> 1:03:45.640]  know that it's the same with our pile we've gone by the way let's just say
[1:03:45.640 --> 1:03:49.520]  for Machiavellian view I don't like being Machiavelli but he hit that site
[1:03:49.520 --> 1:03:54.640]  nobody died and then now he can move against all the enemies of the country
[1:03:54.640 --> 1:03:59.920]  and he's got it I mean and the Chinese are now you know getting in line and
[1:03:59.920 --> 1:04:02.760]  not trying to start World War three I mean I gotta say it Trump really is
[1:04:02.760 --> 1:04:06.560]  impressing me right now and I hate to be a Machiavelli supporter I'm not I'm just
[1:04:06.560 --> 1:04:10.320]  really he knows what he's doing and I've said from the beginning I mean
[1:04:10.320 --> 1:04:14.040]  knowing Donald Trump I said from the beginning Trump has no intention of
[1:04:14.040 --> 1:04:18.320]  putting troops into Syria he's not putting troops into Korea he wants a
[1:04:18.320 --> 1:04:22.520]  strong military so that the world you know we got Stefan Stefan Malin who
[1:04:22.520 --> 1:04:26.600]  coming up but he'll be cool to hold five minutes we've been able to finish on the
[1:04:26.600 --> 1:04:30.120]  fact that you've been pointing out since day one before he would struck what
[1:04:30.120 --> 1:04:32.800]  Trump would probably do I know you that's just because you studied this we
[1:04:32.800 --> 1:04:36.480]  obviously have our sources some of the same ones where we specifically laid out
[1:04:36.480 --> 1:04:39.960]  what his policy is and now he's told the world he just couldn't say it until you
[1:04:39.960 --> 1:04:42.640]  after the strikes were done so stay there dr. course he will finish up with
[1:04:42.640 --> 1:04:46.600]  our DC bureau chief ladies and gentlemen we got Easter special some of the

[1:04:58.720 --> 1:05:06.680]  the more things change the more they stay the same a few months ago president
[1:05:06.680 --> 1:05:11.600]  elect Donald Trump told an audience during his victory tour that his
[1:05:11.600 --> 1:05:17.240]  administration will not take part in regime changes we will stop looking to
[1:05:17.240 --> 1:05:23.520]  topple regimes and overthrow governments folks that was then and this is now
[1:05:23.520 --> 1:05:28.360]  after the false flag chemical attack in Syria which was blamed on Assad
[1:05:28.360 --> 1:05:33.440]  the neocons and the military industrial complex have convinced the new
[1:05:33.440 --> 1:05:38.920]  president that its business as usual and the regime changes will commence my
[1:05:38.920 --> 1:05:43.760]  attitude toward Syria and Assad has changed very much well the only
[1:05:43.760 --> 1:05:50.000]  difference is this time the American Patriots won't be fooled again I'm

[1:08:32.160 --> 1:08:37.280]  system that is the apple of the world's eye and we have Stefan Malin joining us
[1:08:37.280 --> 1:08:42.040]  about five minutes has been having some great analysis and debates with folks
[1:08:42.040 --> 1:08:46.320]  I'm gonna go back to Dr. Corsi here for just a moment so he can finish up our
[1:08:46.320 --> 1:08:50.680]  DC bureau chief we've done got our offices were setting all that up as we
[1:08:50.680 --> 1:08:55.160]  speak he's back in New Jersey right now about to fully move there and we have
[1:08:55.160 --> 1:08:59.240]  this big breaking news exclusive bombshell Obama wiretap Trump insiders
[1:08:59.240 --> 1:09:03.320]  but the reason I held you over for listeners who just joined us is you
[1:09:03.320 --> 1:09:08.200]  got into the fact that you said last Wednesday when the gas attack whoever was
[1:09:08.200 --> 1:09:11.040]  behind it happened a lot of it points towards a false flag and putans come
[1:09:11.040 --> 1:09:14.960]  out said that so is Ron Paul and many others it's just common sense as the
[1:09:14.960 --> 1:09:18.920]  British ambassador to Syria or the former British ambassador but but
[1:09:18.920 --> 1:09:26.480]  regardless I talked to two people on Sunday that talks the president I'll
[1:09:26.480 --> 1:09:31.400]  just leave it at that so it doesn't get too politicized and the president we
[1:09:31.400 --> 1:09:36.560]  have basically a transcripts what the article is the headline that Trump has
[1:09:36.560 --> 1:09:41.800]  been standing up and saying no to the warmongers on a wider war in Syria and
[1:09:41.800 --> 1:09:45.800]  does not want to know flies on but that they agree to give up the chemicals and
[1:09:45.800 --> 1:09:48.840]  it appears that they still have chemicals so that's why he had a right to strike
[1:09:48.840 --> 1:09:52.040]  them and Assad did make a deal with our military and the Russians and the
[1:09:52.040 --> 1:09:58.560]  Russians know that so we have that information now you were able to come up
[1:09:58.560 --> 1:10:02.760]  with that before I guess any of us were able to talk to Trump because you've
[1:10:02.760 --> 1:10:07.160]  known Trump for 40 plus years just just briefly give us a breakdown or just
[1:10:07.160 --> 1:10:13.040]  stalt in five minutes of knowing what he's done with China seeing what China's
[1:10:13.040 --> 1:10:17.720]  doing right now sitting back to Korean ships with massive amounts of coal
[1:10:17.720 --> 1:10:23.360]  they're only major export other than slave labor China saying if North Korea
[1:10:23.360 --> 1:10:27.960]  starts a war China will deal with it and will nuke them they've had a bunch of
[1:10:27.960 --> 1:10:33.620]  wars with them obviously so North Korea is kind of like they're in China's
[1:10:33.620 --> 1:10:38.440]  Mexico they have a long relationship lots of wars lots of problems lots of
[1:10:38.440 --> 1:10:42.080]  crises so so what do you make geopolitically right now with the top
[1:10:42.080 --> 1:10:45.400]  search term being World War three and North Korea threatening to nuke our
[1:10:45.400 --> 1:10:48.520]  task force that's entering the South China Sea because I don't want war you
[1:10:48.520 --> 1:10:52.120]  don't want war but sometimes being an appeaser like Neville Chamberlain as you
[1:10:52.120 --> 1:10:56.120]  know gets you a war because you've got North Korea threatening to nuke Tokyo
[1:10:56.120 --> 1:10:59.840]  threatening to nuke Seoul they're completely out of control so I see
[1:10:59.840 --> 1:11:03.320]  Trump being strong you know at least in his message in North Korea what do you
[1:11:03.320 --> 1:11:08.480]  think well Trump is very strong on this I mean I've watched him for years I'll
[1:11:08.480 --> 1:11:11.920]  get it's you know there's always a you know people saying what's either gonna be
[1:11:11.920 --> 1:11:15.720]  we're you know gonna completely concede we're gonna be Neville Chamberlain or
[1:11:15.720 --> 1:11:20.200]  we're gonna go into a World War three Trump has a third way of dealing with
[1:11:20.200 --> 1:11:24.840]  these things Trump you like negotiating with labor unions I mean Trump means it
[1:11:24.840 --> 1:11:28.880]  he's not gonna put troops into Syria he's not gonna go into World War three
[1:11:28.880 --> 1:11:33.720]  he might tell the labor unions in a negotiation you know I'm tired of you
[1:11:33.720 --> 1:11:39.120]  it might make make me a threat to them or but at the end of the negotiation the
[1:11:39.120 --> 1:11:43.880]  unions shake hands with Trump and the workers go to work happily what you're
[1:11:43.880 --> 1:11:50.360]  gonna find is there's no bromance I mean between Putin and Trump Trump sent
[1:11:50.360 --> 1:11:56.280]  missiles into Syria warned the Russians get out Trump's gonna be tough with
[1:11:56.280 --> 1:11:59.920]  Russia and that Tillerson over there right now is being tough with the
[1:11:59.920 --> 1:12:04.120]  Russians well just him bringing the coal back online with a few things Haley
[1:12:04.120 --> 1:12:09.720]  said that's true as absolutely crippled of the price of gas for the Russians so
[1:12:09.720 --> 1:12:12.240]  and he didn't do that to hurt Russia he did that to give us cheaper energy to be
[1:12:12.240 --> 1:12:15.200]  more competitive and then the Russia doesn't want us having a new fabulous
[1:12:15.200 --> 1:12:21.040]  military what is he what Trump wants it's not he's not gonna end up loving
[1:12:21.040 --> 1:12:26.160]  Putin or China he wants to work with both but he wants to work with both from a
[1:12:26.160 --> 1:12:30.680]  position of strength which is yeah we'll launch a missile attack you know
[1:12:30.680 --> 1:12:35.600]  North Korea better worry that we'll send steel teams in there to you know to
[1:12:35.600 --> 1:12:42.480]  assassinate you know this crazy dictator or send missiles at their nuclear and
[1:12:42.480 --> 1:12:47.600]  other facilities Trump will do that he won't hesitate that's the word Trump
[1:12:47.600 --> 1:12:53.320]  has assassination decapitation but the word is they might even use bunker
[1:12:53.320 --> 1:12:56.960]  busters I'm not giving any secrets so they're moving Kim Jong-un around quite
[1:12:56.960 --> 1:13:01.560]  a bit I mean he needs to go his own regime needs to just get rid of him he
[1:13:01.560 --> 1:13:05.400]  needs to be dealt with he's an arrogant crazy person sending people around you
[1:13:05.400 --> 1:13:09.360]  know nerve-gassing his brother I mean he's a real piece of work let's see what
[1:13:09.360 --> 1:13:14.200]  you're gonna find is at the end Russia works with us and China works with us
[1:13:14.200 --> 1:13:19.680]  from a position of strength and it's and Trump is gonna be tough by the way
[1:13:19.680 --> 1:13:23.000]  China's been very belligerent the last day years and grabbing the South China
[1:13:23.000 --> 1:13:26.520]  Sea they're suddenly backing off what else do you think Trump set up in those
[1:13:26.520 --> 1:13:30.920]  three days well I mean Trump made it very clear that he wants to work with
[1:13:30.920 --> 1:13:35.160]  China but he's not gonna be pushed around and he's sick of this North Korea
[1:13:35.160 --> 1:13:39.920]  there's no solution what you know was done by the Clinton administration and
[1:13:39.920 --> 1:13:44.000]  then Obama was they did nothing they said oh we're gonna let them have it
[1:13:44.000 --> 1:13:48.160]  North Korea have the nuclear weapons remember the whole framework agreement
[1:13:48.160 --> 1:13:54.120]  the car put together under the Clinton administration failed and Obama did
[1:13:54.120 --> 1:14:00.400]  nothing the North Korea is laughing at Obama well not laughing anymore they
[1:14:00.400 --> 1:14:06.160]  realizing that Trump will take out their nuclear capacity and he'll do it
[1:14:06.160 --> 1:14:11.560]  effectively and stop that's what he wants to do and by the way next is Iran
[1:14:11.560 --> 1:14:17.360]  it's it first was Syria now it's North Korea as soon as this is done Trump's
[1:14:17.360 --> 1:14:21.560]  gonna move on Iran now he doesn't want to look war with Iran he wants Russia to
[1:14:21.560 --> 1:14:25.440]  come in and say to Iran you know we better put the leash back on you the
[1:14:25.440 --> 1:14:29.440]  same with what you know the way Eric Prince met to try to work on that and
[1:14:29.440 --> 1:14:33.280]  they called that treason that he was trying to get Russia on our side with
[1:14:33.280 --> 1:14:36.760]  Iran that's what you do for the nation that's what the president does is
[1:14:36.760 --> 1:14:40.160]  communicate with the Russians Dr. Corsi great job with your breaking news I
[1:14:40.160 --> 1:14:43.360]  don't even got more breaking news coming to info wars.com some big stories
[1:14:43.360 --> 1:14:47.360]  you're working on thank you so much my pleasure thank you Alex there he goes and
[1:14:47.360 --> 1:14:51.800]  we just got our offices we're getting all set up there in DC and more now
[1:14:51.800 --> 1:14:55.280]  joining us for the balance of the hour to cover the waterfront is Stefan
[1:14:55.280 --> 1:14:59.400]  Malone and of course it really doesn't need any introduction to our audience
[1:14:59.400 --> 1:15:03.400]  but to attend new listeners that tuned in he says millions of viewers and
[1:15:03.400 --> 1:15:08.920]  listeners every week and he's also a prolific researcher and writer and of
[1:15:08.920 --> 1:15:13.720]  course an entrepreneur free domain radio.com is his site we'll talk about
[1:15:13.720 --> 1:15:17.720]  censorship we see intensifying on Google but also other platforms we'll talk
[1:15:17.720 --> 1:15:23.840]  about the situation with war and Syria and Russia and of course the Korean
[1:15:23.840 --> 1:15:29.360]  Peninsula we'll get into this witch hunt that's ongoing that anybody that
[1:15:29.360 --> 1:15:32.480]  doesn't want war with Russia must be a Russian agent they have the economist
[1:15:32.480 --> 1:15:38.320]  today saying now that I'm basically an agent of Syria and I guess Ron Paul is
[1:15:38.320 --> 1:15:41.320]  in Rand Paul because well remember the chemical attacks where they got caught
[1:15:41.320 --> 1:15:45.680]  launching them but see I don't have a memory no no no it's not that that's
[1:15:45.680 --> 1:15:52.400]  admitted it's that the Assad told me okay that's in the economist today I'm
[1:15:52.400 --> 1:15:56.400]  called a useful idiot yes I built one of the biggest independent media
[1:15:56.400 --> 1:16:02.440]  operations in the world the biggest of them like Drudge and and I've got 70
[1:16:02.440 --> 1:16:05.080]  plus employees and we reach 45 million people a week
[1:16:05.080 --> 1:16:09.600]  conservatively conservatively school actually listen or watch yes I'm just a
[1:16:09.600 --> 1:16:14.240]  complete useful idiot I don't know anything I don't know anything I don't
[1:16:14.240 --> 1:16:17.320]  know anything just you know a bunch of my family was in different intelligence
[1:16:17.320 --> 1:16:20.520]  operations and everything else and just grew up around it all and everything
[1:16:20.520 --> 1:16:26.680]  else but I just don't know anything I'm this big giant useful idiot so people
[1:16:26.680 --> 1:16:29.400]  reading the economists and again I don't want to talk about myself but they're
[1:16:29.400 --> 1:16:33.640]  making it all about Alex Jones so they can demonize me take me out of context
[1:16:33.640 --> 1:16:38.320]  then they can shut down everybody else so we're hanging together so we'll go
[1:16:38.320 --> 1:16:42.520]  into all these subjects of Stefan Maloney but but know this they're slowly
[1:16:42.520 --> 1:16:47.080]  strangling free speech and it's accelerating and so we have to point
[1:16:47.080 --> 1:16:50.320]  out hey we told you Trump was gonna come out and say he doesn't want a wider
[1:16:50.320 --> 1:16:54.080]  war and a no-fly zone I told you that on Sunday and Monday and gave you
[1:16:54.080 --> 1:16:58.720]  transcripts of what the president said I said oh White House source it's the
[1:16:58.720 --> 1:17:05.160]  president okay the president what the president says and I'd rather have the
[1:17:05.160 --> 1:17:08.280]  information and have the media have these conniption fits but of course the
[1:17:08.280 --> 1:17:11.360]  FBI says to Congress I'm under surveillance not because I'm a Russian
[1:17:11.360 --> 1:17:15.760]  spy because they cannot stand the fact that the president talks to us and
[1:17:15.760 --> 1:17:21.160]  reads our website at night so there's an amazing amount of stuff to talk about
[1:17:21.160 --> 1:17:26.440]  Stefan Maloney is our guests really appreciate him joining us and coming on
[1:17:26.440 --> 1:17:30.160]  I Stefan I don't know where to begin here but this is just a crazy time to be
[1:17:30.160 --> 1:17:35.520]  alive it is a crazy and great time to be alive Alex said the fact that they're
[1:17:35.520 --> 1:17:38.520]  coming after us the fact that they're trying to demonetize people who are
[1:17:38.520 --> 1:17:42.360]  speaking out on YouTube because YouTube is largely owned by people who are
[1:17:42.360 --> 1:17:47.760]  anti-useless wars you know anti-lap and so on you know Facebook and other places
[1:17:47.760 --> 1:17:51.760]  seem to be a little bit more on the left but we've kind of taken over on YouTube
[1:17:51.760 --> 1:17:55.720]  which is why YouTube is being targeted now so that people unable to speak up
[1:17:55.720 --> 1:17:59.800]  and speak their minds without fear of being demonetized which is why they're
[1:17:59.800 --> 1:18:03.120]  always trying to target your source of income and discredit you at a personal
[1:18:03.120 --> 1:18:07.080]  level rather than actually engage in your arguments you know it used to be known
[1:18:07.080 --> 1:18:10.920]  very well in civilized society that anyone who refused to engage in your
[1:18:10.920 --> 1:18:15.000]  arguments like someone who refused to hit the ball back in a tennis game they
[1:18:15.000 --> 1:18:19.320]  lost my default but unfortunately people have become kind of pro-candies dumb
[1:18:19.320 --> 1:18:23.160]  down good job government schools so now these kinds of attack the source of
[1:18:23.160 --> 1:18:26.880]  income attack your character seem to have some traction but I think we're
[1:18:26.880 --> 1:18:30.880]  gonna win nonetheless well Stefan when we come back what do you want to get
[1:18:30.880 --> 1:18:34.800]  into first obviously you've been not a big fan of these military strikes and I
[1:18:34.800 --> 1:18:38.840]  see your perspective I tend to lean your way but now I'm seeing results out of
[1:18:38.840 --> 1:18:43.200]  what Trump did that's almost scarier because that'll encourage more of this
[1:18:43.200 --> 1:18:47.720]  aggressive stance I am perfectly willing to put the Tomahawks in the rear view
[1:18:47.720 --> 1:18:51.280]  you know that that was a one-time thing it's it's a sort of maybe it's a trial
[1:18:51.280 --> 1:18:54.600]  balloon from the deep state of the military industrial complex my concern
[1:18:54.600 --> 1:18:58.800]  Alex is another ground invasion in the Middle East its commitment to regime
[1:18:58.800 --> 1:19:01.960]  change in the Middle East which has been tried so many times throughout history
[1:19:01.960 --> 1:19:05.840]  and fails every single time and the reasons are pretty clear you were
[1:19:05.840 --> 1:19:09.600]  dealing with a highly indoctrinated fairly low IQ population all the smart
[1:19:09.600 --> 1:19:13.240]  people left the Middle East Middle East decades ago to escape to the West to
[1:19:13.240 --> 1:19:17.280]  escape to other places you don't have the hard clay you need to build the
[1:19:17.280 --> 1:19:21.120]  foundations of some Jeffersonian democracy in the ruins and indoctrinated
[1:19:21.120 --> 1:19:25.320]  mess that is left over from centuries of foreign imperialism and domestic
[1:19:25.320 --> 1:19:28.400]  propaganda right we have to build a wall around it and then people that want to
[1:19:28.400 --> 1:19:31.360]  convert to the West no matter what color they are and want freedom and
[1:19:31.360 --> 1:19:33.960]  prosperity can come here but if you want to come here and make us go under
[1:19:33.960 --> 1:19:37.800]  Sharia and come here and bully everybody and sue everybody that doesn't agree with
[1:19:37.800 --> 1:19:42.000]  Islam and pull all your infighting crap sorry we don't want to be a stone-aged
[1:19:42.000 --> 1:19:47.040]  death cult monotheistic thing where women are slaves right Stefan I certainly
[1:19:47.040 --> 1:19:50.000]  would not want to live under that kind of look absolutely and they want to make
[1:19:50.000 --> 1:19:53.480]  us live under it and it just ain't gonna happen we'll be right back with Stefan

[1:24:14.680 --> 1:24:17.320]  your host I want to play a bunch of clips and cover the waterfront the next
[1:24:17.320 --> 1:24:21.040]  long 18-minute segment coming up this is a short six-minute segment Stefan
[1:24:21.040 --> 1:24:25.680]  Malinu free domain radio is our guest this is a breaking story confirming what
[1:24:25.680 --> 1:24:29.520]  zero hedge was linking to in the people's daily yesterday we'll cover more of the
[1:24:29.520 --> 1:24:32.800]  censorship the next segment because that's that's key folks I know you know
[1:24:32.800 --> 1:24:37.120]  about it but we're becoming conditioned to accept it that's when they've got us
[1:24:37.120 --> 1:24:41.040]  we got about a battle plan on that and more but first China warns North Korea
[1:24:41.040 --> 1:24:45.080]  I'm in massive troop build up on the border we will react strongly to nuclear
[1:24:45.080 --> 1:24:48.920]  threats China says and threatens to take nuclear action says not gonna let the
[1:24:48.920 --> 1:24:53.240]  US do it which is exactly what Trump said he said listen you're making most
[1:24:53.240 --> 1:24:57.320]  your money off the US and Japan knock it off man give massive trade with South
[1:24:57.320 --> 1:25:01.760]  Korea almost none of the North just chill out quit using it as some Cold War
[1:25:01.760 --> 1:25:07.040]  relic see Trump's a realist so this is a big deal he got North Korea's nuclear
[1:25:07.040 --> 1:25:10.440]  test reaching meltdown that's posing gonna happen on the birthday of the
[1:25:10.440 --> 1:25:16.000]  sick in a hereditary dictator Grandfather Kim Jong-un's grandfather Stefan
[1:25:16.000 --> 1:25:20.520]  Malinu could there not be a better poster child of the ridiculousness of
[1:25:20.520 --> 1:25:26.280]  state worship than Kim Jong-un this feckless craven demon smiling fat
[1:25:26.280 --> 1:25:30.840]  chipmunk horrible little creature that you know kills his family with you know
[1:25:30.840 --> 1:25:34.840]  mortars for entertainment out on a grass lawn firing mortars out of a half
[1:25:34.840 --> 1:25:39.720]  mile away I mean he is literally the art type of a spoiled demonic brat who was
[1:25:39.720 --> 1:25:43.480]  given his own planet basically I mean the stuff of satire doesn't go for enough
[1:25:43.480 --> 1:25:47.480]  and then I see the left and people thinking he's cute and funny and liking
[1:25:47.480 --> 1:25:51.800]  malbars and Denver and what the hell and people you know last week in DC
[1:25:51.800 --> 1:25:56.280]  where we're spitting on a small memorial for the victims of communism what is
[1:25:56.280 --> 1:26:01.720]  going on here well people don't like and the left doesn't like him as an example
[1:26:01.720 --> 1:26:06.200]  of the end game of communism which is rancid horrifying totalitarian
[1:26:06.200 --> 1:26:09.800]  dictatorships where people are regularly shipped off to camps where if you manage
[1:26:09.800 --> 1:26:13.200]  to escape the regime of course your family is dragged into these camps where
[1:26:13.200 --> 1:26:17.480]  people live and die underground in minds and die horribly of vitamin D
[1:26:17.480 --> 1:26:22.280]  deficiencies and other ailments and so on it is a monstrous hideous regime and
[1:26:22.280 --> 1:26:26.520]  it was started of course with the support of Stalin at the end of the
[1:26:26.520 --> 1:26:30.880]  Second World War after it had suffered under decades of occupation from Japan
[1:26:30.880 --> 1:26:35.360]  so this is a country that results from significant military and ideological
[1:26:35.360 --> 1:26:40.880]  occupation by foreign powers and so the the left doesn't like it because it
[1:26:40.880 --> 1:26:44.640]  really shows up just what happens in the long run to central planning to price
[1:26:44.640 --> 1:26:49.960]  controls to communism and socialism and all of those toxic ideologies so they
[1:26:49.960 --> 1:26:55.040]  have some sympathy for it because to hate it is you know like they hate Russia
[1:26:55.040 --> 1:26:58.000]  now but they loved Russia under Stalin they loved Russia when it was
[1:26:58.000 --> 1:27:01.360]  murderous now they hate Russia when it's largely Christian and nationalistic
[1:27:01.360 --> 1:27:06.000]  because it goes against the toxic internationalism of the left that's
[1:27:06.000 --> 1:27:09.360]  right and you know it's so pitiful I mean it's great that you know history I
[1:27:09.360 --> 1:27:12.400]  know the audience does but I've studied it because it's so intriguing I don't
[1:27:12.400 --> 1:27:17.560]  study history actually I'd be impressive North Korea has been enslaved for
[1:27:17.560 --> 1:27:23.640]  thousands of years it's never had a free culture and smart you know hard-working
[1:27:23.640 --> 1:27:28.680]  people who the Japanese use as slave labor and as coal miners to fuel
[1:27:28.680 --> 1:27:32.680]  themselves in World War two China has used it had a bunch of wars with them
[1:27:32.680 --> 1:27:37.240]  and then look at the South just 60 years of quasi-freedom one of the richest
[1:27:37.240 --> 1:27:40.800]  countries in the world incredible inventions that you know the people are
[1:27:40.800 --> 1:27:45.360]  just worlds apart compared to the North just a total example of what a little
[1:27:45.360 --> 1:27:48.680]  bit of freedom does and so we can look at North Koreans and laugh at them
[1:27:48.680 --> 1:27:52.760]  worshipping the tyrant but they were born into this you know most the
[1:27:52.760 --> 1:27:56.080]  population has their children taken at birth and put into commune so there's
[1:27:56.080 --> 1:27:59.840]  not even family their mother and father when they're not given love in their
[1:27:59.840 --> 1:28:03.520]  crib or anything when they are given love they're told you know that the dear
[1:28:03.520 --> 1:28:06.700]  leader gives you this love when they're given food Venezuela does this they're
[1:28:06.700 --> 1:28:10.480]  told you know that the spirit of Hugo Chavez gives you this milk I mean it is
[1:28:10.480 --> 1:28:14.480]  the religion of the state and the stupid leftist that think it's cute
[1:28:14.480 --> 1:28:19.440]  sitting here in the wreck of what was freedom have no idea the gates of hell
[1:28:19.440 --> 1:28:23.160]  they've opened well this is this is what people need to understand if a people
[1:28:23.160 --> 1:28:27.000]  who are too young to remember as you and I do Alex the difference between East and
[1:28:27.000 --> 1:28:31.520]  West Berlin in the divided Germany because this has happened a bunch of
[1:28:31.520 --> 1:28:34.760]  times before it happened in Vietnam it happened in Germany when the East and the
[1:28:34.760 --> 1:28:38.920]  West divide up a country when communism and capitalism divide up a country you
[1:28:38.920 --> 1:28:42.640]  know South Korea has like twice the population of North Korea but it has
[1:28:42.640 --> 1:28:46.800]  over 40 times the economic output of North Korea because they're free and
[1:28:46.800 --> 1:28:50.520]  because it has all of this wealth it seems hard to me to understand why they
[1:28:50.520 --> 1:28:55.080]  need 25,000 American troops sitting in there you know many decades after the
[1:28:55.080 --> 1:28:58.880]  end or I guess there was never an official end of the Korean War but to this
[1:28:58.880 --> 1:29:02.680]  is the difference between socialism and central planning and totalitarianism
[1:29:02.680 --> 1:29:07.000]  versus a relatively free market and I gotta tell you Alex the ring of power
[1:29:07.000 --> 1:29:10.680]  is dangling itself in front of me in a very very tempting way because I can
[1:29:10.680 --> 1:29:15.040]  think of two successful regime changes in history brutal though they were we're
[1:29:15.040 --> 1:29:19.160]  talking at the liberation of a Germany under the Nazis and the liberation of
[1:29:19.160 --> 1:29:24.280]  the emperor's grip over the semi-death cult in Japan that occurred of course at
[1:29:24.280 --> 1:29:29.040]  the end of the Second World War you had existing infrastructures decapitated
[1:29:29.040 --> 1:29:32.480]  you had new infrastructures coming the only time that happened before was the
[1:29:32.480 --> 1:29:35.280]  black plague wiping out the elites as well let's come back and talk about that
[1:29:35.280 --> 1:29:38.680]  quite frankly who needs to be wiped out is the elites I'm not calling for violence
[1:29:38.680 --> 1:29:43.080]  but Trump is a blue-collar elite who actually wants to have productivity the
[1:29:43.080 --> 1:29:47.280]  but at least throughout history want feudalism our guests will explain that
[1:29:47.280 --> 1:29:54.120]  when we come back we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the
[1:29:54.120 --> 1:29:57.680]  GCN radio network
[1:29:59.960 --> 1:30:06.000]  Russian President Vladimir Putin says the Syria chemical attack was a false
[1:30:06.000 --> 1:30:12.880]  flag and more are on the way we have information from various sources that a
[1:30:12.880 --> 1:30:17.160]  similar provocation and I can't call it anything other than a provocation is
[1:30:17.160 --> 1:30:21.480]  being prepared in other parts of Syria including the southern suburbs of
[1:30:21.480 --> 1:30:27.000]  Damascus where they're again prepared to lease some similar chemical substances
[1:30:27.000 --> 1:30:31.280]  and accuse the Syrian authorities of using them Putin went on to compare the
[1:30:31.280 --> 1:30:36.560]  situation in Syria to Saddam Hussein's non-existent weapons of mass
[1:30:36.560 --> 1:30:41.680]  destruction which may indicate that he believes the US is either behind the
[1:30:41.680 --> 1:30:46.480]  false flag or actively pushing the propaganda meanwhile the Russian
[1:30:46.480 --> 1:30:52.120]  government says Syrian forces possess no chemical weapons and any further attacks
[1:30:52.120 --> 1:30:57.560]  in Syria by the United States will be unacceptable you can learn more right

[1:33:45.800 --> 1:33:49.960]  I know I've done the right thing I've always tried to tell the truth I make
[1:33:49.960 --> 1:33:54.240]  mistakes sometimes we correct what we do but I really do care about humanity I
[1:33:54.240 --> 1:33:56.880]  don't get off on seeing other people being brought down we're talking about
[1:33:56.880 --> 1:34:00.840]  feudalism here in a moment but if you understand these inbred elites a lot of
[1:34:00.840 --> 1:34:04.600]  them have had their DNA checked it's been proven that there are psychopathic
[1:34:04.600 --> 1:34:08.440]  tendencies a lot of these royal houses people that have inbred you see a lot of
[1:34:08.440 --> 1:34:12.360]  that in in Islam I mean it's there's folks in Appalachia and breeding and
[1:34:12.360 --> 1:34:15.080]  there's a lot of killers and stuff you just need to stop doing it we're not
[1:34:15.080 --> 1:34:18.200]  criticizing folks there in Middle East just stop having you know stop marrying
[1:34:18.200 --> 1:34:24.000]  your sister and we're facing a bunch of crazy people and so I'm all stirred up
[1:34:24.000 --> 1:34:26.720]  and angry trying to do something about it and I've got them coming after me
[1:34:26.720 --> 1:34:30.000]  because they think those of us that are nice and friendly you're just gonna roll
[1:34:30.000 --> 1:34:34.720]  over we're not and they've gone from laughing at us down to lying about us
[1:34:34.720 --> 1:34:39.040]  demonizing is trying to you know shut us down well listen we already have
[1:34:39.040 --> 1:34:43.120]  amazing products like the 40% off and that sales gonna end in just a couple
[1:34:43.120 --> 1:34:48.120]  days on the pro pure water filtration nomad system as gravity-fed I mean at
[1:34:48.120 --> 1:34:51.680]  120 something bucks you just can't beat it the leading competitors like 300 for
[1:34:51.680 --> 1:34:55.920]  a similar unit that doesn't even filter as good that's available at info wars
[1:34:55.920 --> 1:35:01.760]  store.com that special is gonna end very very soon beautiful stainless steel
[1:35:01.760 --> 1:35:05.800]  unit cuts out all the garbage leaves in the good minerals cuts out the fluoride
[1:35:05.800 --> 1:35:09.400]  cuts out the there's just hundreds of chemicals even in the average well
[1:35:09.400 --> 1:35:13.240]  water glyphosate you name it you need to be filtering your your water if you
[1:35:13.240 --> 1:35:15.840]  don't care at least filter your children's water so much of the bottle
[1:35:15.840 --> 1:35:18.520]  water's not good I drink some nice mineral waters and things that are great
[1:35:18.520 --> 1:35:21.760]  they're out of natural springs the point is there's a lot of stuff you buy
[1:35:21.760 --> 1:35:25.600]  from the you know Houston tap water and they just put it through a cheap carbon
[1:35:25.600 --> 1:35:30.120]  filter and just makes it taste good but doesn't cut out the real garbage so
[1:35:30.120 --> 1:35:34.880]  again we have that filtration system we've never offered 40% off on that but
[1:35:34.880 --> 1:35:38.640]  that is a loss leader there I think we make like 10 bucks or something also we
[1:35:38.640 --> 1:35:43.720]  have survival shield x2 the good halogen nascent iodine is selling out fast it's
[1:35:43.720 --> 1:35:48.440]  the cleanest purest form out there we have to get a DEA license to buy it
[1:35:48.440 --> 1:35:52.000]  from the oil companies you get it for 25% off all supplies last even though it
[1:35:52.000 --> 1:35:56.480]  sold out last week we got a limited supply in a produced right here in the
[1:35:56.480 --> 1:36:00.280]  good old us of a we're quickly selling out of our remaining deep earth iodine
[1:36:00.280 --> 1:36:03.960]  supply at info wars life comm as we face the biggest threat to our supply in
[1:36:03.960 --> 1:36:07.760]  more than four years now is the chance to stock up on the essential supplement
[1:36:07.760 --> 1:36:11.520]  and drastically reduced price we found this deep earth source that nobody else
[1:36:11.520 --> 1:36:15.760]  had because we got our really clean kelp source which is good and clean but not
[1:36:15.760 --> 1:36:21.600]  as strong so again that's how we found this again 25% off and help us get
[1:36:21.600 --> 1:36:25.760]  enough funding to try to place a new order of the deep earth iodine with a
[1:36:25.760 --> 1:36:28.760]  supplier actually a gas company wants that oil company they're drilling for
[1:36:28.760 --> 1:36:33.160]  gases where they get it since we were able to secure the most high quality true
[1:36:33.160 --> 1:36:38.880]  iodine from a 99.999 plus deep earth source more than four years ago we have
[1:36:38.880 --> 1:36:44.480]  never faced a bigger threat to our supply our analysis say that we are being
[1:36:44.480 --> 1:36:47.920]  targeted by grips I want to cut off our funding and shut down info wars I mean
[1:36:47.920 --> 1:36:51.120]  we're being hit by every angle they're clearly surveilling us they've clearly
[1:36:51.120 --> 1:36:54.960]  got inside intel on how the operation works and they are just like gremlins
[1:36:54.960 --> 1:36:57.920]  running around foaming at the mouth I mean it's it's a lot of fun let me tell
[1:36:57.920 --> 1:37:00.640]  you but again I'll be able to see why better not fight the globalist we're in
[1:37:00.640 --> 1:37:05.640]  the war it's a 21st century economic war info war I am so proud that we're
[1:37:05.640 --> 1:37:11.160]  devastating them but I mean it's just everything is just it's just where it's
[1:37:11.160 --> 1:37:13.960]  like the Alamo folks I mean I'm just running a musket here in a minute I
[1:37:13.960 --> 1:37:17.760]  mean this is crazy or 300 I mean that's that's the political level of this
[1:37:17.760 --> 1:37:26.760]  Watson's had his monetization cut by 75% in one month we're cut by like 60% and
[1:37:26.760 --> 1:37:30.600]  and again they're just celebrating in the news the Democrats and David Brock oh
[1:37:30.600 --> 1:37:33.360]  look we're shutting them off oh it's great for us give us more money we'll
[1:37:33.360 --> 1:37:36.240]  shoot Nazi collaborator give us more money we'll shut up that loudmouth
[1:37:36.240 --> 1:37:41.280]  American but we're burning them down politically we're talking to the
[1:37:41.280 --> 1:37:45.640]  president we're breaking the big news our metrics are going straight up so it's
[1:37:45.640 --> 1:37:50.920]  crazy everything they do suddenly doors open and then support happens so I'm
[1:37:50.920 --> 1:37:53.760]  just praying to God every day it's an amazing kind of you live but you need
[1:37:53.760 --> 1:37:59.200]  these great products just like our info is game-changing our our products are
[1:37:59.200 --> 1:38:02.240]  game-changing I go I mean I didn't sell a water filtration system those gravity
[1:38:02.240 --> 1:38:05.280]  fed for four years because I couldn't find one that was up the specs that was
[1:38:05.280 --> 1:38:08.760]  good enough we finally did now there's three companies we sell their apples and
[1:38:08.760 --> 1:38:11.800]  oranges different ones are better at this or that Pro Peer is great Alexa
[1:38:11.800 --> 1:38:16.120]  Peer is great the point is is that I mean I treat you like I want to be treated
[1:38:16.120 --> 1:38:23.920]  not because it's beyond metaphysical it's an ingrained thing okay and I'm not
[1:38:23.920 --> 1:38:28.120]  bragging I'm some wonderful person you know I was the type of guy when I was
[1:38:28.120 --> 1:38:31.400]  younger I might go after your wife if you're not around but but if you boil
[1:38:31.400 --> 1:38:35.840]  this down I mean I'm just being honest I'm not perfect if you boil all this down
[1:38:35.840 --> 1:38:40.560]  I just want to be treated like I want to be treated I'm gonna treat you like that

[1:39:17.880 --> 1:39:22.360]  to know we're in a serious battle and take Stefan Malinou you know we're going
[1:39:22.360 --> 1:39:25.760]  from reaching millions a week to tens of millions a week it's good to know he's
[1:39:25.760 --> 1:39:29.120]  there with free domain radio.com I haven't asked him specifically about his
[1:39:29.120 --> 1:39:32.440]  monetization but let's ask him now you can follow him on Twitter at
[1:39:32.440 --> 1:39:36.960]  to Stefan Malinou looks like Malinoux with X well the reason I'm making a big
[1:39:36.960 --> 1:39:41.600]  issue out of this is it's so it's the Democrats it's the UN it's George
[1:39:41.600 --> 1:39:46.400]  Soros it's in the WikiLeaks by name they say arrest them as Russian spies shut
[1:39:46.400 --> 1:39:49.760]  off info wars shut off Breitbart we're the main groups are trying to shut off
[1:39:49.760 --> 1:39:53.840]  the federal elections commission says shut off Rudge everyone should be
[1:39:53.840 --> 1:39:56.920]  horrified it's not like I'm up here saying oh I'm being censored oh you know
[1:39:56.920 --> 1:40:01.280]  give me more money we're here with the main globalist force spending half their
[1:40:01.280 --> 1:40:05.640]  time on us demonizing his articles coming out every minute and I'm talking
[1:40:05.640 --> 1:40:09.320]  every few minutes demon sometimes thousands of days Stefan so when I bring
[1:40:09.320 --> 1:40:12.720]  this up we are the issue I don't want to be gone so journalism almost ever
[1:40:12.720 --> 1:40:16.040]  talk about myself all day we're in the center of this this is happening it's
[1:40:16.040 --> 1:40:19.920]  happening to you I know because I know anybody's a libertarian or a patriot
[1:40:19.920 --> 1:40:23.360]  some would call you a liberal you know the the globalist call you a right
[1:40:23.360 --> 1:40:27.080]  winger it's all a load of crap none of these definitions mean anything I'm a
[1:40:27.080 --> 1:40:34.280]  super classical liberal pro-freedom live and let live guy just it's crazy the
[1:40:34.280 --> 1:40:37.600]  liberals are like the they have a religion of being neurotic weirdos just
[1:40:37.600 --> 1:40:41.120]  like super right-wing Christians and I'm just sick of their cult I'm sick of
[1:40:41.120 --> 1:40:44.440]  Islam I'm sick of all these groups trying to make me be in their cult and
[1:40:44.440 --> 1:40:48.560]  and then we're under attack what do you think we should do what have you gone
[1:40:48.560 --> 1:40:52.000]  through how do I get it through the listeners I know they're supporting but
[1:40:52.000 --> 1:40:56.560]  I understand if they can shut us down folks we'll be like China it's over
[1:40:56.560 --> 1:41:00.080]  they're going after the First Amendment nakedly and have the left
[1:41:00.080 --> 1:41:07.160]  celebrating yeah yeah shut Alex up arrest team I mean it's crazy Stefan it
[1:41:07.160 --> 1:41:12.880]  is and I hate to be annoying I told you so guys to to other people but many many
[1:41:12.880 --> 1:41:17.240]  years ago I recognize the dangers of the waters I was treading into and I made a
[1:41:17.240 --> 1:41:21.400]  very very clear business plan around decentralizing my monetization so I
[1:41:21.400 --> 1:41:25.840]  take donations directly from listeners at free domain radio calm slash donate
[1:41:25.840 --> 1:41:29.520]  and of course everyone has their part to play some of us are the more vocal
[1:41:29.520 --> 1:41:33.640]  mouthpieces maybe we have the the history we have the charisma we have the
[1:41:33.640 --> 1:41:37.480]  fluid linguistic skills we can make goofy jokes and we can get the message
[1:41:37.480 --> 1:41:40.760]  across to the audience other people can help support in their own ways they can
[1:41:40.760 --> 1:41:43.880]  share videos they can like videos they can talk with their friends and family if
[1:41:43.880 --> 1:41:47.160]  they want a more private life they can donate they can do lots of things but
[1:41:47.160 --> 1:41:51.920]  we all need to work together of course they're gonna go after the source of our
[1:41:51.920 --> 1:41:54.800]  income because they perceive that we're going after the source of their income
[1:41:54.800 --> 1:41:58.320]  which a lot of times is government spending military industrial complex
[1:41:58.320 --> 1:42:02.880]  massive amounts of welfare refugee settlement money you name it affirmative
[1:42:02.880 --> 1:42:06.160]  action they feel that we're going after the source of their income when we start
[1:42:06.160 --> 1:42:09.960]  talking about equality before the law a true free market letting supply and
[1:42:09.960 --> 1:42:13.480]  demand set prices not having the government regulations choke and
[1:42:13.480 --> 1:42:17.280]  claustrophobic everything off that people are trying to do to make a buck so
[1:42:17.280 --> 1:42:22.480]  yeah they're retaliating in in money wars because they can't match us in the
[1:42:22.480 --> 1:42:25.960]  intellectual wars and everyone has their part to play in helping to fight back
[1:42:25.960 --> 1:42:30.240]  what do you save in your money for if we lose if there's increasing censorship
[1:42:30.240 --> 1:42:33.800]  if their first amendment is lost if they're a useless foreign wars your
[1:42:33.800 --> 1:42:37.360]  money's gonna end up worthless anyway you might as well spend it now in the fight
[1:42:37.360 --> 1:42:41.360]  for freedom that's right so many people go oh things are bad I'm gonna hoard my
[1:42:41.360 --> 1:42:45.400]  money more you lose it to globalists you lose everything that's why this year I've
[1:42:45.400 --> 1:42:49.440]  said I'm not even intending to take any profit I you know for myself as backup
[1:42:49.440 --> 1:42:54.240]  money for my family I'm going to spend everything in expanding and doing
[1:42:54.240 --> 1:42:58.520]  everything I can because exactly it's claustrophobic that's what it feels like
[1:42:58.520 --> 1:43:04.280]  you said it South Korea has 40 times the GDP of the north they have
[1:43:04.280 --> 1:43:07.680]  incredible wealth some of the best medicine in the world some of the best
[1:43:07.680 --> 1:43:11.320]  universities the most connected group in the world versus a place that only has
[1:43:11.320 --> 1:43:16.160]  two cities that have any light almost no cars don't the people that want
[1:43:16.160 --> 1:43:21.280]  affirmative this affirmative that understand free market is the engine
[1:43:21.280 --> 1:43:26.440]  never perfect but it over delivers a hundred to one versus collectivism my
[1:43:26.440 --> 1:43:30.720]  god don't they understand if you look at look at American foreign policy right
[1:43:30.720 --> 1:43:34.040]  and the foreign policy of the West there were a number of totalitarian
[1:43:34.040 --> 1:43:39.240]  dictatorships throughout the 20th century where there was a often fractious but
[1:43:39.240 --> 1:43:43.080]  generally non-confrontational coexistence I mean there were proxy wars and all of
[1:43:43.080 --> 1:43:47.080]  that but if you look at places like Russia Russia Russia was allowed to fall
[1:43:47.080 --> 1:43:51.880]  down on its own and China China was allowed to reform itself to a large
[1:43:51.880 --> 1:43:55.680]  degree starting in the 90s on its own look at extreme socialism that was
[1:43:55.680 --> 1:43:59.680]  handed to to India after the Second World War under the Raj by all these
[1:43:59.680 --> 1:44:03.560]  British educated socialists it was allowed to reform on its own and now you
[1:44:03.560 --> 1:44:07.920]  have 50,000 people a month a month in India going from poverty to the middle
[1:44:07.920 --> 1:44:13.560]  class so there are ways that countries can reform themselves if they're allowed
[1:44:13.560 --> 1:44:17.240]  to sort of continue down that path but if you go in and start blowing people up
[1:44:17.240 --> 1:44:20.880]  it is going to turn a lot of the population against you it may in fact
[1:44:20.880 --> 1:44:24.560]  retard any progress now that having been said I was talking earlier about the
[1:44:24.560 --> 1:44:28.760]  ring of power I'm tempted by Alex if I had to choose between intervention in
[1:44:28.760 --> 1:44:32.600]  Syria regime change in Syria versus regime change in North Korea I would choose
[1:44:32.600 --> 1:44:36.320]  North Korea every day of the week and twice on Sundays because I think of the
[1:44:36.320 --> 1:44:39.920]  people groaning in these concentration camps starving to death afraid to have
[1:44:39.920 --> 1:44:44.720]  children afraid to open their mouths these weekly self-condemnation situations
[1:44:44.720 --> 1:44:48.040]  with these henpecking parties where you're supposed to nag at yourself and
[1:44:48.040 --> 1:44:52.080]  nag at everyone else where you didn't polish the the dear president's picture
[1:44:52.080 --> 1:44:56.160]  enough and if you could take out that leadership you know this is an amoral
[1:44:56.160 --> 1:45:00.120]  geopolitical calculation so forgive me for for stepping in this direction but
[1:45:00.120 --> 1:45:04.960]  that is that is a decapitation politically that could conceivably work
[1:45:04.960 --> 1:45:09.640]  in the same way it worked in Japan in the same way that it worked in Germany you
[1:45:09.640 --> 1:45:15.320]  have a high IQ population that are desperate for freedom you're absolutely
[1:45:15.320 --> 1:45:19.040]  on target with that let's speak for you back into the World War three and it is
[1:45:19.040 --> 1:45:24.280]  only important stuff stuff I'm all in him about feudalism because the average
[1:45:24.280 --> 1:45:27.800]  person just gets caught up in daily life and doesn't study history so they don't
[1:45:27.800 --> 1:45:31.360]  know the establishment doesn't want people know obviously or they'd be free
[1:45:31.360 --> 1:45:35.200]  and then they wouldn't need these monopolies anymore but why do elites
[1:45:35.200 --> 1:45:39.640]  throughout history create feudalism they clearly know that it's a monopoly of
[1:45:39.640 --> 1:45:43.400]  power and that that's how they stay in power and never actually have to
[1:45:43.400 --> 1:45:47.320]  perform or compete I mean that's what we're up against well of course look at
[1:45:47.320 --> 1:45:50.320]  the elites and how they were developed throughout most of human history most of
[1:45:50.320 --> 1:45:55.000]  human history was bloody warfare was repression was brutality was violence
[1:45:55.000 --> 1:45:59.720]  and so who floats to the top in a prison well it tends to be the most violent
[1:45:59.720 --> 1:46:02.840]  and so if you look at the aristocracies around the world a lot of
[1:46:02.840 --> 1:46:06.160]  inbreeding which you talked about before and we can look at the the Syrian
[1:46:06.160 --> 1:46:10.080]  situation where there's you know between 30% in the cities and 40% cousin
[1:46:10.080 --> 1:46:14.160]  marriage going on in the countries which suppresses IQ significantly so the
[1:46:14.160 --> 1:46:18.320]  elites not only are the inbred but also they have floated to the top usually
[1:46:18.320 --> 1:46:21.800]  through their capacity to commit violence either directly as the king or on
[1:46:21.800 --> 1:46:25.200]  behalf of the king who were the nobles who were the aristocracy those who
[1:46:25.200 --> 1:46:28.520]  slaughtered usually the most defenseless peasants on behalf of the king in order
[1:46:28.520 --> 1:46:32.600]  to repress people and gain tax revenue so the elites have been bred for
[1:46:32.600 --> 1:46:37.080]  ferocity and have been inbred into some pretty challenging intellectual
[1:46:37.080 --> 1:46:42.560]  standards or capacity so that is an ancient inbred murder cult in a way that
[1:46:42.560 --> 1:46:47.080]  has fostered the foundation of a lot of elites in society and it is a pretty
[1:46:47.080 --> 1:46:52.200]  demonic group as a whole he's elaborating on that because I mean again
[1:46:52.200 --> 1:46:55.800]  that's why history so fascinating people that haven't looked into it just replete
[1:46:55.800 --> 1:47:00.720]  with this yeah you so you have to be willing to kill for the king and and
[1:47:00.720 --> 1:47:03.720]  the more you kill for the king and the more revenue you generate for the king
[1:47:03.720 --> 1:47:06.640]  and the more peasants you enslave and conquer for the king the more you're
[1:47:06.640 --> 1:47:11.080]  promoted up in at court so it you know most of human history is a well
[1:47:11.080 --> 1:47:16.640]  decorated well-costumed well-bejeweled mafia and who rises in the mafia it's
[1:47:16.640 --> 1:47:20.160]  not the nice guy it's not Barney the Dinosaur and it's not the guy who likes
[1:47:20.160 --> 1:47:24.400]  to hug trees it's the guy who can boast most efficiently kill or in threatened
[1:47:24.400 --> 1:47:28.960]  for profit and because these people were incredibly violent in their origins and
[1:47:28.960 --> 1:47:33.160]  in their promotion they dragged with them a lot of sophists who would help
[1:47:33.160 --> 1:47:41.320]  recast the murderousness of the elites as patriotism a bunch of sick a fanic
[1:47:41.320 --> 1:47:45.000]  artist in people who would then like worship and make the evil look
[1:47:45.000 --> 1:47:49.640]  beautiful just like we see in North Korea well yes and of course just like
[1:47:49.640 --> 1:47:52.960]  we see in a lot of government-funded art which is making the ugly appear
[1:47:52.960 --> 1:47:56.680]  beautiful and attempting to corrupt our love of beauty and are therefore our
[1:47:56.680 --> 1:48:01.600]  love of truth in order to get us to view evil as good which is the foundation
[1:48:01.600 --> 1:48:06.120]  for allegiance to a lot of political elites we should show for TV viewers
[1:48:06.120 --> 1:48:09.320]  some North Korean art but anybody can search engine it and pull it up step on
[1:48:09.320 --> 1:48:15.760]  Malin is our guest let's look at some of these headlines we have China
[1:48:15.760 --> 1:48:18.400]  threatening to bomb North Korea's nuclear facilities we have Google search
[1:48:18.400 --> 1:48:24.160]  for World War three hits highest ever we have price of gold going up on the
[1:48:24.160 --> 1:48:29.720]  concerns we have China's president calling Trump urges peaceful approach to
[1:48:29.720 --> 1:48:35.040]  North Korea so that's just some of the news we have on that front more and more
[1:48:35.040 --> 1:48:38.880]  do you think North Korea will back down because they're the big wild card how
[1:48:38.880 --> 1:48:44.080]  much control does China really have Stefan from your research I do not think
[1:48:44.080 --> 1:48:48.640]  that North Korea will back down power as we've talked about before is a very
[1:48:48.640 --> 1:48:51.760]  highly addictive drug and there's very few people there are a few people but
[1:48:51.760 --> 1:48:55.760]  very few people in history have a relinquished power voluntarily because
[1:48:55.760 --> 1:48:59.840]  it is so addictive so this there's two things that that need to be done in my
[1:48:59.840 --> 1:49:02.600]  opinion and I don't know which one of the right one is they all leave this to
[1:49:02.600 --> 1:49:06.720]  you and your listeners to sort of concentrate on but isolating the
[1:49:06.720 --> 1:49:10.240]  country is not going to do any good you know one of the things that laid the
[1:49:10.240 --> 1:49:14.560]  foundation to World War two was a 70% drop in international trade that came
[1:49:14.560 --> 1:49:17.000]  out because of America's protectionism and the rest of the world's
[1:49:17.000 --> 1:49:21.200]  protectionism so you know it's an old state saying that when goods stop
[1:49:21.200 --> 1:49:24.480]  crossing borders soldiers will start crossing borders when countries are
[1:49:24.480 --> 1:49:29.760]  united in trade they tend to be going to war less against each other North Korea
[1:49:29.760 --> 1:49:33.400]  if it remains completely isolated from the world economy will have no way ever
[1:49:33.400 --> 1:49:36.760]  of integrating into the world economy when it integrates into the world
[1:49:36.760 --> 1:49:41.320]  economy if that's even possible there's a flow back and forth of goods and you
[1:49:41.320 --> 1:49:44.960]  know the last ruler of North Korea was hugely enamored as a lot of people are
[1:49:44.960 --> 1:49:48.480]  of Western culture didn't like the American government or the Western
[1:49:48.480 --> 1:49:52.840]  governments but loved Western culture if the Koreans North Koreans can get
[1:49:52.840 --> 1:49:56.520]  access to trade to goods to Western culture there's a chance that an
[1:49:56.520 --> 1:49:59.800]  incipient freedom movement might begin to spontaneously arise within the
[1:49:59.800 --> 1:50:05.920]  borders of North Korea or that's another possibility sorry go ahead well
[1:50:05.920 --> 1:50:08.840]  you're right but they don't have electricity they are totally kept away
[1:50:08.840 --> 1:50:15.680]  from Western culture they believe that the world still in 1947 basically but
[1:50:15.680 --> 1:50:20.080]  have no idea again what planet they're on kind of like a lot of Afghans and so
[1:50:20.080 --> 1:50:23.120]  they just don't understand that's what brought down the Soviet Union was they
[1:50:23.120 --> 1:50:26.080]  could see how we were living or at least how Hollywood claimed we were they just
[1:50:26.080 --> 1:50:30.160]  have no idea so we have to come back and talk about how do you break through
[1:50:30.160 --> 1:50:33.560]  that because sure Kim Jong-un's brother was running off to you know Disney
[1:50:33.560 --> 1:50:37.520]  world in Tokyo and you know Kim Jong-un things Dennis Rodman's really cool
[1:50:37.520 --> 1:50:40.840]  they're all obsessed with it they know how hard imagine what it's like for him
[1:50:40.840 --> 1:50:46.240]  though in his decrepit heartable pathetic country and then he's got hundreds
[1:50:46.240 --> 1:50:49.920]  or thousands of channels and he can see how the rest of the world's living
[1:50:49.920 --> 1:50:54.200]  imagine how pathetic Kim Jong-un feels or does he really like walking around
[1:50:54.200 --> 1:51:02.120]  like a little demon smiling a little piggy eyes if you have under eye bags and

[1:54:32.840 --> 1:54:38.960]  coming up and then we've got Millie Weaver and of course Owen Schreuer with
[1:54:38.960 --> 1:54:45.120]  the Associated Press talking about UN child kidnapping rings which the media
[1:54:45.120 --> 1:54:49.280]  says don't exist out of one side of their mouth and I haven't even got into
[1:54:49.280 --> 1:54:53.360]  Sean Spicer not that the story is important but how they misrepresent on
[1:54:53.360 --> 1:55:00.080]  every front but I also want to mention the North Korea paradigm with Malinu
[1:55:00.080 --> 1:55:06.640]  because he is a I think a deep thinker I don't say that you know as a little
[1:55:06.640 --> 1:55:12.720]  verbal flourish as a compliment it's just true imagine being Kim Jong-un because
[1:55:12.720 --> 1:55:16.160]  I'm a good guy and I work hard and I care about people and I don't have cultural
[1:55:16.160 --> 1:55:19.960]  guilt I still get guilty that I'm smarter than a lot of people I'm not
[1:55:19.960 --> 1:55:22.840]  saying I'm perfect I got problems or that I do have nice things even though I
[1:55:22.840 --> 1:55:26.800]  don't worship the nice things I can tell other people feel bad that I have
[1:55:26.800 --> 1:55:30.120]  nicer things than they do and it's just weird when knowledge is really the
[1:55:30.120 --> 1:55:34.880]  greatest value so is it genetic with these dictators and people it is a
[1:55:34.880 --> 1:55:38.440]  regulatory dictatorship soon they'll be wearing crowns in North Korea that Kim
[1:55:38.440 --> 1:55:44.560]  Jong-un just looks completely psychotic like a cartoon character like the Joker
[1:55:44.560 --> 1:55:50.120]  smiling maniacally with a bunch of crazy people behind him with a bunch of rotting
[1:55:50.120 --> 1:55:55.760]  1950s crap around them and then I see the left running around going we want
[1:55:55.760 --> 1:56:00.880]  socialism we want communism we want you know we want malism and I'm like the
[1:56:00.880 --> 1:56:05.880]  Chinese rejected malism you idiots I mean you want some crazy chipmunk ruling
[1:56:05.880 --> 1:56:09.720]  over you and you want to work 18 hours a day I just I don't understand so some
[1:56:09.720 --> 1:56:13.120]  answers question and we'll come back in the next short segment and get into
[1:56:13.120 --> 1:56:17.880]  Spicer and all this but stuff on Malinu free domain radio calm what do you
[1:56:17.880 --> 1:56:21.320]  think's going through these dictators minds or are they just so selfish they
[1:56:21.320 --> 1:56:26.280]  don't even care when he's watching how fabulously rich just quasi free market
[1:56:26.280 --> 1:56:29.160]  countries are with all our problems compared to what he's done to his people
[1:56:29.160 --> 1:56:34.320]  how does he psychically I don't think consciously he doesn't care but it's
[1:56:34.320 --> 1:56:37.800]  got to be some blood level all right I guess he is super unhealthy and his dad
[1:56:37.800 --> 1:56:42.520]  was unhealthy I guess do they not know that there's literally a blowback not
[1:56:42.520 --> 1:56:45.400]  even spiritual people don't believe in that they've genetically proven you're
[1:56:45.400 --> 1:56:49.720]  doing bad things around you it's kind of your body doesn't like it your body
[1:56:49.720 --> 1:56:54.240]  gives you cancer doesn't he know that what he's doing is bad well I mean this
[1:56:54.240 --> 1:56:58.840]  is the question of the conscience and the conscience is not evenly distributed
[1:56:58.840 --> 1:57:02.920]  across the population there is a combination of genetic and environmental
[1:57:02.920 --> 1:57:08.800]  factors that can help produce people who don't have a conscience this is really
[1:57:08.800 --> 1:57:11.120]  really important for people to understand we're not all the same don't
[1:57:11.120 --> 1:57:14.680]  mistake the world for yourself so you and I and others we care about the world
[1:57:14.680 --> 1:57:17.960]  we'll take the personal hits to make the world a better place for our kids for
[1:57:17.960 --> 1:57:21.520]  everyone for the future and that's because I feel obligated to all of the
[1:57:21.520 --> 1:57:25.040]  great heroes and heroines in the past who helped deliver a relatively free
[1:57:25.040 --> 1:57:28.880]  world for me to be able to pass it along add to it and move it to the next
[1:57:28.880 --> 1:57:32.080]  generation hopefully enhanced you know we don't inherit freedom from our
[1:57:32.080 --> 1:57:36.520]  ancestors we borrow it from our children and we need to add to it in the same way
[1:57:36.520 --> 1:57:39.280]  we need to protect the environment but there are studies in England that show
[1:57:39.280 --> 1:57:43.720]  if you have a genetic predisposition to a certain kind of psychopathy to a
[1:57:43.720 --> 1:57:47.600]  certain amount of conscience less behavior if you're exposed to child
[1:57:47.600 --> 1:57:52.000]  abuse particularly beatings physical violence and so on then 100% of the kids
[1:57:52.000 --> 1:57:57.040]  who had this genetic tendency who were exposed to violence became criminals and
[1:57:57.040 --> 1:58:01.760]  and so on so there is this capacity partly genetic and partly environmental
[1:58:01.760 --> 1:58:05.920]  the development of the of the conscience and of empathy involves 13
[1:58:05.920 --> 1:58:09.880]  complicated parts of your brain all interacting together and it's a very
[1:58:09.880 --> 1:58:13.760]  challenging thing to try and get it into people after the fact it's like a
[1:58:13.760 --> 1:58:16.320]  language window you know I don't remember teaching my daughter all the
[1:58:16.320 --> 1:58:19.720]  words that she uses but she just kind of picks them up and starts using them if
[1:58:19.720 --> 1:58:23.640]  you start trying to teach kids at the age of 10 language they never really
[1:58:23.640 --> 1:58:26.720]  pick it up very organically that's right if you put babies in cribs and they're
[1:58:26.720 --> 1:58:30.320]  not up next to you they don't learn empathy it's it is spiritual let me I
[1:58:30.320 --> 1:58:34.000]  mean I mean whatever you want to call it there's this deepness and a lot of people
[1:58:34.000 --> 1:58:37.800]  don't get this deepness if you get the deepness or the place of the most high
[1:58:37.800 --> 1:58:41.160]  then you're interconnected to everybody and people are missing that we'll be
[1:58:41.160 --> 1:58:43.560]  back and it's not like we're on some high horse folks we have all the evil
[1:58:43.560 --> 1:58:46.280]  thoughts and all the rest of it it's just that we have the other thoughts too
[1:58:46.280 --> 1:58:53.000]  we'll be right back with Stefan Maladu powerful this is Alex Jones I want to tell
[1:58:53.000 --> 1:58:56.640]  you about a way to save a lot of money on one of the best new off the grid
[1:58:56.640 --> 1:59:00.480]  products of 2017 and seriously I really think everyone should have one of these
[1:59:00.480 --> 1:59:03.840]  I'm talking about the PPX solar generator system from our friends at
[1:59:03.840 --> 1:59:08.040]  solutions from science one of our oldest sponsors the PPX is so small you
[1:59:08.040 --> 1:59:11.960]  can put it in your pocket but so powerful you can run some 110 appliances at
[1:59:11.960 --> 1:59:16.160]  your house like a small refrigerator so you can keep food from spoiling plus you
[1:59:16.160 --> 1:59:19.640]  can take it with you to jumpstart cars trucks buses 18 wheelers heavy
[1:59:19.640 --> 1:59:23.160]  equipment even airplanes the system provides an endless supply of off the
[1:59:23.160 --> 1:59:27.000]  grid electricity allowing you to create your own private power grid literally
[1:59:27.000 --> 1:59:31.440]  anywhere in the world perfect for cabins remote locations any time you need to
[1:59:31.440 --> 1:59:35.760]  get off the grid for a while go to privatepowergrid.com to watch this thing

[1:59:46.080 --> 1:59:50.240]  that's privatepowergrid.com
[1:59:50.240 --> 2:00:01.040]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:00:12.360 --> 2:00:18.800]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop
[2:00:18.800 --> 2:00:28.280]  tyranny well so does he live from the info wars.com studios it's alex jones
[2:00:28.280 --> 2:00:33.760]  now the fact that they're having to censor hundreds of prominent classical
[2:00:33.760 --> 2:00:37.040]  liberals that's who they're really going after not right wingers not fake left
[2:00:37.040 --> 2:00:40.560]  wingers but people that really do just want to go hey this works the best in
[2:00:40.560 --> 2:00:43.920]  society we want to bring it back we didn't invent it but we'd like to you
[2:00:43.920 --> 2:00:47.120]  know go in the direction we were going not we you know towards North Korea you
[2:00:47.120 --> 2:00:49.760]  can go the direction the United States and England and places have been going
[2:00:49.760 --> 2:00:53.200]  for the last 200 years we'd like to go in that direction you know not the other
[2:00:53.200 --> 2:00:57.320]  direction but the fact that they're having to come out and try to censor us
[2:00:57.320 --> 2:01:02.480]  and shut us down and do all this really shows they're losing step on my little
[2:01:02.480 --> 2:01:05.400]  free domain radio comms our guests in a few minutes we have a look for Roger
[2:01:05.400 --> 2:01:09.360]  Stone pops in with us Sean Spicer obviously it's a stupid non-story
[2:01:09.360 --> 2:01:15.160]  because technically he's right Hitler didn't use offensive chemical weapons
[2:01:15.160 --> 2:01:19.240]  on the battlefield until the very end and then there actually was some it's a
[2:01:19.240 --> 2:01:22.280]  little more esoteric and hard to find but it's in some history books that some
[2:01:22.280 --> 2:01:28.760]  but he used massive chemicals against populations I mean I mean undoubtedly
[2:01:28.760 --> 2:01:32.040]  it started killing retarded children you name it you inject a retarded child
[2:01:32.040 --> 2:01:34.600]  with a chemical that kills them that's a chemical weapon are you you know they
[2:01:34.600 --> 2:01:39.520]  had mobile vans gassing people so so he says you know even Hitler didn't use
[2:01:39.520 --> 2:01:43.320]  gas I love how he's warmongering that's where he's wrong on this whole you know
[2:01:43.320 --> 2:01:48.560]  thing with Syria probably a false flag but then in his in his lust to look
[2:01:48.560 --> 2:01:52.320]  like he hates Syria he then jumps on this whole Holocaust thing well Spicer's
[2:01:52.320 --> 2:01:56.040]  family wasn't involved in the Holocaust so so why is it like some guilt now with
[2:01:56.040 --> 2:02:01.320]  fake Democrat groups calling them the Anne Frank Center to say that he's guilty
[2:02:01.320 --> 2:02:06.320]  Stefan of this when technically he was right I said what the hell's he thinking
[2:02:06.320 --> 2:02:09.600]  it's like Schwarzenegger saying I want to kill my opponents with carbon monoxide
[2:02:09.600 --> 2:02:13.240]  I'm like your dad was an SS officer that sounds really dumb Arnold doesn't get it
[2:02:13.240 --> 2:02:17.120]  so technically he's right they use me saying what is he an idiot of course they
[2:02:17.120 --> 2:02:22.320]  use chemical weapons that's saying I'm attacking Spicer so it's just lie upon
[2:02:22.320 --> 2:02:25.840]  line it was like hundreds of newspapers all over the news last night then I was
[2:02:25.840 --> 2:02:30.520]  attacking Spicer totally made up what do you make of this of course he was not
[2:02:30.520 --> 2:02:34.200]  denying the Holocaust he misspoke or he spoke in a way that could be
[2:02:34.200 --> 2:02:38.120]  misinterpreted and because he's a Republican the mainstream media is going
[2:02:38.120 --> 2:02:42.520]  to misinterpret what Sean Spicer said in the most negative possible way and
[2:02:42.520 --> 2:02:46.680]  he's gonna rouse the usual suspects to rail against him and so on but as most
[2:02:46.680 --> 2:02:49.840]  things that are happening under the Trump administration a lot is being
[2:02:49.840 --> 2:02:54.080]  revealed about the mainstream media my god Alex the pornography that these
[2:02:54.080 --> 2:02:58.480]  people are addicted to you know when there was a hint of a potential ground
[2:02:58.480 --> 2:03:03.120]  war in Syria if there's a hint of sudden military action against the Middle
[2:03:03.120 --> 2:03:06.720]  Eastern country that has not directly or even indirectly threatened the United
[2:03:06.720 --> 2:03:11.920]  States they're suddenly all over this war this military industrial complex
[2:03:11.920 --> 2:03:15.520]  they're not offended by that potential at all by another multi-trillion dollar
[2:03:15.520 --> 2:03:18.600]  misadventures I've got to interrupt you hundreds of thousands of people but one
[2:03:18.600 --> 2:03:23.120]  guy misspeaks and now they're outraged I've got interrupted you can do five
[2:03:23.120 --> 2:03:26.280]  more minutes I'd like to interview you with stone if you do if you got to go
[2:03:26.280 --> 2:03:31.760]  it's okay but Mauna you're amazing I've got to just say this I'm during the one
[2:03:31.760 --> 2:03:37.240]  minute break 70 second break thinking I'm gonna come back and make the point
[2:03:37.240 --> 2:03:40.960]  that these evil war mongers and all these evil bad things are involved in and
[2:03:40.960 --> 2:03:44.640]  then some guy misspeaks then they project the Holocaust on him and then I
[2:03:44.640 --> 2:03:47.520]  forget to make the point and you make it better than I would and that is awesome
[2:03:47.520 --> 2:03:50.840]  because that's exactly how my brain works and it seems like other people's
[2:03:50.840 --> 2:03:54.960]  don't like who are these monsters that push all these lies all these wars all
[2:03:54.960 --> 2:03:58.760]  this tyranny they back radical Islam they cover it up they won't show us I saw
[2:03:58.760 --> 2:04:02.520]  your tweet like all you need to know is that they didn't show you the dead bodies
[2:04:02.520 --> 2:04:08.440]  from Stockholm and the car attack but they did show the you know up close stuff
[2:04:08.440 --> 2:04:11.560]  for the babies with the nerve gas it's so ridiculous when you're simply
[2:04:11.560 --> 2:04:17.840]  conscious it's not that we're even smart we just are awake they don't believe
[2:04:17.840 --> 2:04:22.960]  anything that comes out of a republicans mouth but if Turkey says oh
[2:04:22.960 --> 2:04:27.080]  absolutely for sure it was sarin gas and we managed to have the ambulances right
[2:04:27.080 --> 2:04:30.840]  there as the bombs were dropped we took it back we analyzed it completely that
[2:04:30.840 --> 2:04:34.040]  apparently is a hundred percent verified that apparently is a hundred no
[2:04:34.040 --> 2:04:38.360]  skepticism no skepticism about what could potentially be a false flag attack
[2:04:38.360 --> 2:04:44.040]  as if the WMD and lie in Iraq never ever happen as if the Gulf of Tonkin
[2:04:44.040 --> 2:04:48.800]  never ever happen as if no other culture there's no history of the complete
[2:04:48.800 --> 2:04:52.880]  line with useless war exactly if you got to go you got to go you five more
[2:04:52.880 --> 2:04:56.800]  minutes on this side great Stefan Malinan and we're gonna have Roger Stone
[2:04:56.800 --> 2:05:02.720]  with us too at the same time and he'll hold it longer the more things change
[2:05:02.720 --> 2:05:07.960]  the more they stay the same a few months ago president-elect Donald Trump
[2:05:07.960 --> 2:05:13.720]  told an audience during his victory tour that his administration will not take
[2:05:13.720 --> 2:05:19.840]  part in regime changes we will stop looking to topple regimes and overthrow
[2:05:19.840 --> 2:05:25.200]  governments folks that was then and this is now after the false flag chemical
[2:05:25.200 --> 2:05:30.440]  attack in Syria which was blamed on Assad the neocons and the military
[2:05:30.440 --> 2:05:35.200]  industrial complex have convinced the new president that it's business as
[2:05:35.200 --> 2:05:40.680]  usual and the regime changes will commence my attitude toward Syria and
[2:05:40.680 --> 2:05:46.440]  Assad has changed very much well the only difference is this time the American

[2:08:32.280 --> 2:08:35.920]  coming up about 52 minutes Roger Stone's gonna be live hosting the fourth
[2:08:35.920 --> 2:08:40.560]  hour former head of the Trump campaign I got stuff on Malinu here to tell us
[2:08:40.560 --> 2:08:43.040]  whether five minutes or so I wanted him to have a chance to ask Roger any
[2:08:43.040 --> 2:08:45.880]  questions he's kind of like to bring different guests on together occasionally
[2:08:45.880 --> 2:08:52.800]  and have a panel here they attack our credibility every millisecond I mean
[2:08:52.800 --> 2:08:55.720]  there's just articles every minute or two coming out with this lies things we
[2:08:55.720 --> 2:09:00.120]  didn't say you name it creating division it's a major sigh but we bring that up
[2:09:00.120 --> 2:09:06.240]  because what are we doing we're having an effect it's intensifying and the MSM
[2:09:06.240 --> 2:09:09.960]  is losing its power that they're not effectively shutting us down they're
[2:09:09.960 --> 2:09:13.320]  losing intellectual battles and now they want to shut us down that's a magic
[2:09:13.320 --> 2:09:16.840]  moment because if they fail in the censorship they take us to the next
[2:09:16.840 --> 2:09:20.560]  level like Paul Watson says conservatism which is really just means
[2:09:20.560 --> 2:09:26.280]  neoliberalism going back to stuff that was actually the cutting edge is the
[2:09:26.280 --> 2:09:29.560]  new punk rock and of course now the head of the sex pistols a month after Watson
[2:09:29.560 --> 2:09:32.400]  said that came out and said yeah Watson's right that's the case and the
[2:09:32.400 --> 2:09:35.480]  left just can't stand it because they're the status Kim Jong-un's not cool
[2:09:35.480 --> 2:09:39.960]  that's not liberal the tyranny they want to not cool Venezuela's not liberal it's
[2:09:39.960 --> 2:09:43.880]  not cool liberal means open free keep more what you have so we've got Roger
[2:09:43.880 --> 2:09:49.320]  Stoner give us a preview of what's coming up but I called Roger on Sunday and I
[2:09:49.320 --> 2:09:54.000]  said listen I just talked to my winehouse source and he told me that Trump's not
[2:09:54.000 --> 2:09:56.360]  gonna have no fly zone this is a limited deal because I hadn't got rid of their
[2:09:56.360 --> 2:09:59.480]  chemicals and he said well you got a good source that's that's what I've got
[2:09:59.480 --> 2:10:02.880]  because I don't want to be you know be basically quoted in all this cuz I want
[2:10:02.880 --> 2:10:06.240]  to keep my connections you know you know there as I said I understand but you know
[2:10:06.240 --> 2:10:09.240]  here he is I've talked to him yesterday he said you know it's fine to tell some
[2:10:09.240 --> 2:10:12.280]  of the story now but here's an example White House source Trump pushes back
[2:10:12.280 --> 2:10:16.600]  against neocon plan to invade Syria so the good news is and I want to go to
[2:10:16.600 --> 2:10:20.520]  step on first on this is Trump's now come out on Fox business and other places
[2:10:20.520 --> 2:10:24.160]  and and now you see a surrogates have backed off and aren't saying they want
[2:10:24.160 --> 2:10:27.360]  water war in Syria even though they're now on the news saying they want war
[2:10:27.360 --> 2:10:34.800]  crimes charges so it really really shows that Trump is battling a bunch of people
[2:10:34.800 --> 2:10:38.560]  in his own cabinet that do whatever they want I mean I I'm not trying to give the
[2:10:38.560 --> 2:10:44.240]  president a pass here on some of this it just shows that not even 1% of the
[2:10:44.240 --> 2:10:47.640]  federal agencies are doing what he says that they're just doing whatever they
[2:10:47.640 --> 2:10:54.520]  want Stefan they are testing whether or not the population is going to go to war
[2:10:54.520 --> 2:10:58.040]  or whether the population is going to resist a war I'm not saying any
[2:10:58.040 --> 2:11:00.960]  particular individual it's like a B testing right like you put out two
[2:11:00.960 --> 2:11:03.720]  trailers you see what one is more popular and then that's the one you use
[2:11:03.720 --> 2:11:07.960]  for the wider audience you test a product before you try and sell it and so
[2:11:07.960 --> 2:11:11.640]  I think that various elements within the government were floating up the idea of
[2:11:11.640 --> 2:11:15.200]  invasion regime chains boots on the ground and others were saying well a
[2:11:15.200 --> 2:11:18.520]  political solution or maybe something else or whatever and they were working
[2:11:18.520 --> 2:11:21.240]  to see what kind of reaction they were going to get not just from the general
[2:11:21.240 --> 2:11:24.920]  public but from the supporting base of people who were on social media who
[2:11:24.920 --> 2:11:28.120]  helped Donald Trump get elected and I think the pushback against the war
[2:11:28.120 --> 2:11:32.240]  narrative is one of the reasons why the pendulum tipped more to the side of a
[2:11:32.240 --> 2:11:35.640]  post of a peaceful solution and everybody should be proud who participated in
[2:11:35.640 --> 2:11:39.480]  that particular by the way I agree but McMasters admittedly said regime change
[2:11:39.480 --> 2:11:44.320]  for ISIS anisad and as Roger Stone said on Wednesday and Thursday limited
[2:11:44.320 --> 2:11:49.080]  strike but if you go into a big war you're done Roger Stone can you comment
[2:11:49.080 --> 2:11:51.400]  on that and I want to give him the other news you have but I want to get one
[2:11:51.400 --> 2:11:56.520]  question in from from Stefan Malinow to you well first of all I salute my
[2:11:56.520 --> 2:12:02.120]  friend Stefan we had a very vigorous discussion last week on his podcast
[2:12:02.120 --> 2:12:08.120]  about this very topic I would make the point just slightly different
[2:12:08.120 --> 2:12:15.040]  interpretation of Stefan is that the neocons the globalists the establishment
[2:12:15.040 --> 2:12:20.040]  types around the president whether they are White House staff from the
[2:12:20.040 --> 2:12:25.800]  Republican National establishment or whether they are Democrats or others
[2:12:25.800 --> 2:12:35.840]  Bushites brought in by Jerry Kushner and and Ivanka Trump I think they have pushed
[2:12:35.840 --> 2:12:41.280]  the president in the direction of war they would like him to be more
[2:12:41.280 --> 2:12:49.080]  mainstream more neocon they think that the praise of your actions by John
[2:12:49.080 --> 2:12:54.360]  McCain and Hillary and Obama they think that's a good thing sadly I think the
[2:12:54.360 --> 2:12:59.960]  president hasn't had a countervailing influence on him that I don't think that
[2:12:59.960 --> 2:13:04.160]  there are a circle advisors reminding him that the bedrock principle of
[2:13:04.160 --> 2:13:10.240]  Trumpism is non-interventionism that he promised us no more foreign wars for
[2:13:10.240 --> 2:13:15.080]  regime change when our interests the United States or the interests of the
[2:13:15.080 --> 2:13:20.000]  locals are not sure but Roger word for word what we got from our White House
[2:13:20.000 --> 2:13:24.200]  source Sunday and and my other source as well and I called you about it you were
[2:13:24.200 --> 2:13:28.040]  kind of well that sounds accurate but I'm not gonna make any statements is now
[2:13:28.040 --> 2:13:31.720]  in the news where he's saying I don't want war I don't want to apply zones so
[2:13:31.720 --> 2:13:34.800]  so that's very encouraging or do you think Stefan's right I'm not saying he's
[2:13:34.800 --> 2:13:39.400]  right or wrong that it's like beta testing no I think Stefan is half right
[2:13:39.400 --> 2:13:43.520]  he's being pushed in the direction of war despite the fact that there's no
[2:13:43.520 --> 2:13:49.720]  countervailing a council from advisors to the contrary his instincts are right
[2:13:49.720 --> 2:13:56.680]  on he has he reads social media he follows cable television he follows info
[2:13:56.680 --> 2:14:03.160]  wars and therefore the reaction of the rank and file Trump supporter has
[2:14:03.160 --> 2:14:08.800]  registered he knows who he is he knows what he stands for so it is Trump making
[2:14:08.800 --> 2:14:14.920]  the decisions to turn away from the interventionist path his advisors
[2:14:14.920 --> 2:14:21.600]  Mattis McMaster they have failed to capture the king and in transforming into
[2:14:21.600 --> 2:14:26.240]  being our next neocon Roger I want you to be able to tell us what's up next in
[2:14:26.240 --> 2:14:29.320]  the fourth hour when you host and some of the big news I know you're gonna be
[2:14:29.320 --> 2:14:31.920]  breaking today but I wanted to get since I held Stefan over he's always has great
[2:14:31.920 --> 2:14:35.000]  questions Stefan I throw one question in there at Roger and then thanks for
[2:14:35.000 --> 2:14:38.840]  joining us well I think what the American I mean comment than a question I
[2:14:38.840 --> 2:14:41.840]  think the American people is seeing that Trump is having a challenging time
[2:14:41.840 --> 2:14:45.960]  enacting some of the central platforms of his domestic agenda the Constitution
[2:14:45.960 --> 2:14:48.680]  clearly gives the president the right to control immigration but he's being
[2:14:48.680 --> 2:14:53.040]  blocked from doing that repeatedly by liberal Obama appointed judges he wished
[2:14:53.040 --> 2:14:56.240]  to repeal and replace Obamacare that is hitting challenges he's done some great
[2:14:56.240 --> 2:15:00.160]  work but he's having challenges getting his domestic agenda done what people are
[2:15:00.160 --> 2:15:03.880]  seeing is that what they want what they really want from Trump is hard for him
[2:15:03.880 --> 2:15:07.120]  to do domestically but man if he wants to go lob some bombs by which he's
[2:15:07.120 --> 2:15:10.240]  supposed to go through Congress the entire system is a slippery slope that
[2:15:10.240 --> 2:15:13.560]  allows him to do that I think people are getting a sense of how big the fight is
[2:15:13.560 --> 2:15:16.840]  ahead of us and how much we're gonna need to concentrate to support and it
[2:15:16.840 --> 2:15:20.360]  shows how reckless the elite and it shows our reckless the elites are you
[2:15:20.360 --> 2:15:27.000]  have a final question for Roger yes so Roger do you think that people are
[2:15:27.000 --> 2:15:30.160]  beginning to wake up to some of the challenges in the deep state fighting
[2:15:30.160 --> 2:15:34.520]  back and what a monolith it is that needs to be opposed I think they are
[2:15:34.520 --> 2:15:41.560]  today's news that Carter Page a low-level issue advisor to Donald Trump who
[2:15:41.560 --> 2:15:45.360]  admits today's never met Donald Trump or even shaking his hand and who had no
[2:15:45.360 --> 2:15:50.800]  authority in his campaign was subject to government surveillance to a FISA warrant
[2:15:50.800 --> 2:15:55.280]  I believe that there's a great deal of evidence that indicates that I was also
[2:15:55.280 --> 2:16:00.400]  surveilled under that very same warrant or a duplicate of it and I think Paul
[2:16:00.400 --> 2:16:06.960]  Manafort was as well their rationale for this Stefan was the Russian collusion
[2:16:06.960 --> 2:16:10.800]  which clearly doesn't exist and for which there is no evidence meaning their
[2:16:10.800 --> 2:16:16.840]  real motive was politics they were using the investigative surveillance
[2:16:16.840 --> 2:16:22.040]  capability of our intelligence services to spy on Trump and his advisors for
[2:16:22.040 --> 2:16:28.600]  purely political reasons totally illegal Watergate times 10 if Ehrlichman and
[2:16:28.600 --> 2:16:33.040]  Holloman and others can go to jail well then Rice and Jarrett and perhaps even
[2:16:33.040 --> 2:16:36.760]  those above them can go to jail well this was using the official state to
[2:16:36.760 --> 2:16:41.440]  illegally spy on a mass scale look they admitted a month ago in Congress in the
[2:16:41.440 --> 2:16:49.120]  House armed services committee that I Alex Jones in full wars and Breitbart are
[2:16:49.120 --> 2:16:55.680]  under investigation for actually being under Russian control outrageous folks
[2:16:55.680 --> 2:17:01.160]  outrageous that's like saying I'm under Martian control now why they do that
[2:17:01.160 --> 2:17:04.000]  because they're got us under surveillance and they want to be able to tell the
[2:17:04.000 --> 2:17:08.240]  president don't talk to Alex Jones don't talk to Roger Stone because they're
[2:17:08.240 --> 2:17:12.000]  under investigation is Russian spies that's how they don't talk to Nunes he's
[2:17:12.000 --> 2:17:16.400]  under investigation now oh and Rand Paul he's under investigation they're saying
[2:17:16.400 --> 2:17:20.520]  get rid of the entire election and get rid of all the Republicans that got
[2:17:20.520 --> 2:17:24.320]  elected because the Russians ran it all Roger it's now reached that level in
[2:17:24.320 --> 2:17:29.280]  Atlantic Monthly and in the Economist magazine well and there's one person who
[2:17:29.280 --> 2:17:33.440]  for sure knows that that's false that would be Donald J. Trump the president
[2:17:33.440 --> 2:17:40.320]  of the United States and I think that strategy has failed I trust his instincts
[2:17:40.320 --> 2:17:46.040]  I understand that when Donald Trump has all the information he will invariably
[2:17:46.040 --> 2:17:48.680]  make the right decision all right I've kind of run over here I know you got to
[2:17:48.680 --> 2:17:51.920]  go in two minutes you're up in 40 minutes live Stefan Molyneux my friend
[2:17:51.920 --> 2:17:55.440]  thank you so much for joining us today I just always always thought provoking
[2:17:55.440 --> 2:17:58.720]  thank you sir thank you we got two minutes to break Roger sorry for
[2:17:58.720 --> 2:18:02.240]  interrupting tell us what's coming up in the next hour well I think we're gonna
[2:18:02.240 --> 2:18:06.520]  focus Alex on the Trump economy something he's not getting credit for
[2:18:06.520 --> 2:18:11.640]  we're going to talk about the machinations of Google to strangle
[2:18:11.640 --> 2:18:17.360]  alternative media which is you know surged in this most recent election we're
[2:18:17.360 --> 2:18:21.960]  gonna talk about Stephen K. Bannon and why the president seemed to throw him
[2:18:21.960 --> 2:18:27.080]  over the side in an interview in which he the president actually said I barely
[2:18:27.080 --> 2:18:32.040]  know the guy so that will be a focus a lot of good inside stuff and we'll be
[2:18:32.040 --> 2:18:36.800]  making some news in the next hour I don't know if you can say this on there
[2:18:36.800 --> 2:18:40.840]  but what's that rule about Trump you know first he starts saying hey what do
[2:18:40.840 --> 2:18:43.520]  you think of this guy and then hey other people are saying bad things about this
[2:18:43.520 --> 2:18:47.200]  guy the next I don't know this guy that's when you're going yeah that and
[2:18:47.200 --> 2:18:51.080]  that appears to be the three steps here look I like Steve Bannon and we probably
[2:18:51.080 --> 2:18:55.760]  have a closer worldview than some of the others on the White House staff but in
[2:18:55.760 --> 2:19:00.560]  many ways I think he has fostered his own problems here and we'll analyze it in
[2:19:00.560 --> 2:19:03.640]  the next hour well sure like the famous thing the media keeps saying he's
[2:19:03.640 --> 2:19:09.680]  Trump's brain I mean I know Trump Trump knows that's bull but it just becomes a
[2:19:09.680 --> 2:19:13.360]  distraction for the fact it is Trump calling the shots undoubtedly that's
[2:19:13.360 --> 2:19:17.480]  what I always call me or you Trump's brain which is just ridiculous yeah I'm
[2:19:17.480 --> 2:19:21.320]  gonna look this is a very key point I think that there are those in the
[2:19:21.320 --> 2:19:24.960]  mainstream media have who have picked up on the fact that the president hates it
[2:19:24.960 --> 2:19:29.640]  when he believes others are taking credit for his accomplishments if you
[2:19:29.640 --> 2:19:33.520]  read my book to making the president 2016 I make very clear that Trump is his
[2:19:33.520 --> 2:19:37.960]  own strategist that there is no coral rogue in Trump world and by the way
[2:19:37.960 --> 2:19:43.680]  that's not high Trump really is the guy I mean look us absolutely all right
[2:19:43.680 --> 2:19:49.560]  that's up on drugs saying he's not my brain sure what she's worse though Alex
[2:19:49.560 --> 2:19:55.360]  that's that shirt that he's wearing or the headline I'm not sure
[2:19:55.360 --> 2:19:59.440]  Roger Stone coming up in 40 minutes I'll be back with your phone calls and more

[2:24:17.280 --> 2:24:27.280]  all those pictures days are past me now I've got so much more to think about
[2:24:27.280 --> 2:24:36.280]  deadlines and commitments what to leave in what to leave out
[2:24:36.280 --> 2:24:53.520]  notice because of optics because the president paralyzed the lying media
[2:24:53.520 --> 2:24:59.480]  saying he's a Russian agent with no proof such poppycock then all his best
[2:24:59.480 --> 2:25:03.040]  supporters and people that support the return of our republic or Russian
[2:25:03.040 --> 2:25:08.120]  agents by a bunch of globalists trying to get rid of our country sovereignty the
[2:25:08.120 --> 2:25:18.120]  open traders the open enemies that he hasn't met with Vladimir Putin yet and
[2:25:18.120 --> 2:25:20.240]  they're not even talking about doing it anytime in the near future they're
[2:25:20.240 --> 2:25:26.960]  already supposed to meet so when Rex Tillerson went over to Moscow Putin said
[2:25:26.960 --> 2:25:31.120]  I'm not meeting with you bro so he's meeting with Lavrov the foreign
[2:25:31.120 --> 2:25:34.360]  minister of the equivalent of the Secretary of State I was watching earlier
[2:25:34.360 --> 2:25:38.200]  while he was just like you hang people you murder him you do you bomb Belgrade
[2:25:38.200 --> 2:25:44.520]  for the Muslims you take over and then you tell us that there's war crimes with
[2:25:44.520 --> 2:25:51.040]  no proof but he said listen we want Assad out we agreed four years ago there's a
[2:25:51.040 --> 2:25:53.920]  transcript in there I mean the press conference is ongoing but here's a
[2:25:53.920 --> 2:25:59.160]  minute or two of it and then we've got UN sex crimes that are all confirmed UN
[2:25:59.160 --> 2:26:05.600]  child sex ring is a new guy and he prefers not looking into history but to
[2:26:05.600 --> 2:26:10.160]  deal with the matters of today but the thing is the world is built in such a
[2:26:10.160 --> 2:26:15.160]  fashion that if we do not take lessons from the past we will happily be able to
[2:26:15.160 --> 2:26:23.720]  achieve success in the present and I record certain situations when groups of
[2:26:23.720 --> 2:26:30.720]  countries primarily Western countries native countries were sort of
[2:26:30.720 --> 2:26:37.760]  fixated on eliminating this or that dictator an authoritarian or totalitarian
[2:26:37.760 --> 2:26:46.200]  leader in order to oust Slobodan Milosevic president of Axis Yugoslavia
[2:26:46.200 --> 2:26:54.640]  NATO in 1999 launch to war in 1999 and gross violation of the UN
[2:26:54.640 --> 2:27:01.200]  chart as well as the health and key final act of the OSCE TV station was
[2:27:01.200 --> 2:27:06.840]  bombed which incidentally as a military crime however you interpret the Geneva
[2:27:06.840 --> 2:27:17.040]  conventions residential areas were shelled the Chinese embassy was also
[2:27:17.040 --> 2:27:24.040]  attacked civil chains and bridges were bombed the shelling went on for three
[2:27:24.040 --> 2:27:36.000]  months and then they ran out of targets that could be
[2:27:36.000 --> 2:27:44.720]  qualified as double g-duel use facilities there was another dictator
[2:27:44.720 --> 2:27:50.440]  Saddam Hussein who was hanged after the invasion we know how this invasion was
[2:27:50.440 --> 2:27:58.320]  justified since that I think Tony Blair was the only one to repent publicly
[2:27:58.320 --> 2:28:06.040]  admitting that it had been a fake all the grounds for the Iraq invasion there
[2:28:06.040 --> 2:28:09.320]  was another when mama Gaddafi
[2:28:09.320 --> 2:28:18.240]  it had been said that there was no place for this dictator in his country it
[2:28:18.240 --> 2:28:24.040]  was said that democracy would prevail but that's Sergey Lavrov Russia's foreign
[2:28:24.040 --> 2:28:29.600]  minister and here's the deal I'm not a russophobe I've never been to Russia but
[2:28:29.600 --> 2:28:34.920]  I'm I was on the air while all this happened I covered it six seven days a
[2:28:34.920 --> 2:28:41.560]  week I remember it all like yesterday everything Lavrov is saying is true so I
[2:28:41.560 --> 2:28:46.920]  look at our leaders especially under Obama and Bush it was just all lies the
[2:28:46.920 --> 2:28:52.920]  list of the Russians it's basically the truth that's a sick feeling but I've
[2:28:52.920 --> 2:28:55.600]  studied the Soviet Union and watch those old film reels and stuff they would
[2:28:55.600 --> 2:29:02.880]  tell ridiculous lies back then they acted like our media and you really got
[2:29:02.880 --> 2:29:06.960]  understand it's not that the Russians are that good we're not lionizing him or
[2:29:06.960 --> 2:29:12.720]  putting him up on some pedestal our elite took over the dominant power of
[2:29:12.720 --> 2:29:17.280]  America in the globe and ran our name into the ground and has just run around
[2:29:17.280 --> 2:29:23.360]  on power trips crazier than a you know what rat trying to get global
[2:29:23.360 --> 2:29:27.000]  domination when we could all just have trade with each other we've got so much
[2:29:27.000 --> 2:29:32.840]  technology and innovations it's not about square feet anymore and I'm not
[2:29:32.840 --> 2:29:36.240]  against having militaries and all that stuff my point is is that we're gonna
[2:29:36.240 --> 2:29:40.320]  kill each other we keep doing this and we shouldn't be on the side of radical
[2:29:40.320 --> 2:29:45.280]  jihadis who started the war in Syria I mean yeah Assad's a bad guy but he didn't
[2:29:45.280 --> 2:29:49.600]  start the war and who we're back in 50 times worse stay with us we're on the
[2:29:49.600 --> 2:29:57.680]  March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[2:29:59.600 --> 2:30:05.920]  Russian President Vladimir Putin says the Syria chemical attack was a false
[2:30:05.920 --> 2:30:12.760]  flag and more are on the way we have information from various sources that a
[2:30:12.760 --> 2:30:17.040]  similar provocation and I can't call it anything other than a provocation is
[2:30:17.040 --> 2:30:21.320]  being prepared in other parts of Syria including the southern suburbs of
[2:30:21.320 --> 2:30:26.880]  Damascus where they're again prepared to lease some similar chemical substances
[2:30:26.880 --> 2:30:31.160]  and accuse the Syrian authorities of using them Putin went on to compare the
[2:30:31.160 --> 2:30:36.440]  situation in Syria to Saddam Hussein's non-existence weapons of mass
[2:30:36.440 --> 2:30:41.560]  destruction which may indicate that he believes the US is either behind the
[2:30:41.560 --> 2:30:46.400]  false flag or actively pushing the propaganda meanwhile the Russian
[2:30:46.400 --> 2:30:52.040]  government says Syrian forces possess no chemical weapons and any further attacks
[2:30:52.040 --> 2:30:57.040]  in Syria by the United States will be unacceptable and you can learn more

[2:33:56.480 --> 2:34:01.280]  Tillerson in the Kremlin after warning us Russian relations have degraded under
[2:34:01.280 --> 2:34:04.320]  Donald Trump is that in public or is that happening right now we'll pull that
[2:34:04.320 --> 2:34:09.080]  up and see what's happening on that front but the big thing everybody's
[2:34:09.080 --> 2:34:13.280]  watching right now is the situation with North Korea I'll cover that briefly
[2:34:13.280 --> 2:34:21.320]  before we go into the fourth hour today with Roger Stone now Millie Weaver just
[2:34:21.320 --> 2:34:26.080]  came back with Zimmerman and Gavin and the great intrepid crew from LA for a
[2:34:26.080 --> 2:34:34.080]  week that your great support is listeners allows to investigate child sex crimes
[2:34:34.080 --> 2:34:38.200]  and they went to official orphanages and official state police and sheriff's
[2:34:38.200 --> 2:34:42.480]  departments and saw the documentation of like a thousand arrestors so the last
[2:34:42.480 --> 2:34:47.040]  few months in LA alone in California I know it's like 3,000 plus by Trump so
[2:34:47.040 --> 2:34:50.080]  far green lighting police who were scared to do this we're not so much
[2:34:50.080 --> 2:34:53.280]  child-born we mean the people being trafficked and we're not just talking
[2:34:53.280 --> 2:34:58.320]  about 15 year old girls or you know young men or whatever that's that's illegal
[2:34:58.320 --> 2:35:02.520]  and horrible we're talking about little kids so I thought all these arrests get
[2:35:02.520 --> 2:35:05.720]  announced but nothing ever is in the news after so you guys spent a week there
[2:35:05.720 --> 2:35:09.920]  you've got all this footage you and Gavin it's gonna start coming out some
[2:35:09.920 --> 2:35:14.280]  came out tonight last night some more tonight some more tomorrow you also got
[2:35:14.280 --> 2:35:17.920]  into a place that nobody gets into we're gonna be showing that tomorrow that
[2:35:17.920 --> 2:35:22.600]  actually shows the real black magic Bibles the real child sacrifice stuff
[2:35:22.600 --> 2:35:27.040]  from the Big Getty Museum that that nobody gets access to but you guys have
[2:35:27.040 --> 2:35:30.280]  some connections because you're from Hollywood and you know some of those
[2:35:30.280 --> 2:35:34.440]  folks so this is this is a big deal because here's what happens we cover
[2:35:34.440 --> 2:35:40.920]  child abuse we cover originalistic abuse the media covers the pizza place
[2:35:40.920 --> 2:35:44.960]  pizza gates just code words for for pedophilia obviously that's the FB
[2:35:44.960 --> 2:35:49.080]  manuals the media focuses on a pizza place to then discredit everybody well
[2:35:49.080 --> 2:35:54.400]  and see we figure that out early on we're the ones exposing that and then the
[2:35:54.400 --> 2:35:57.880]  media goes oh you're weak Alex you know you retract the word come after you fine
[2:35:57.880 --> 2:36:02.720]  let's go because I know I have have have gone with the truth exposed things
[2:36:02.720 --> 2:36:06.440]  been honest it's not weakness that we retract things when we're wrong covering
[2:36:06.440 --> 2:36:10.280]  somebody else's report because we have credibility we want people to know that
[2:36:10.280 --> 2:36:15.760]  there are thousands of mainstream news articles since I've been on air that I've
[2:36:15.760 --> 2:36:23.200]  seen in 1995 on the internet there are mainstream news AP today Owen Stroyer
[2:36:23.200 --> 2:36:29.880]  brought up you and child sex ring left victims but no arrest and then you've
[2:36:29.880 --> 2:36:37.600]  got Obama's high-level official caught smuggling kids out of Haiti convicted of
[2:36:37.600 --> 2:36:41.680]  it and convicted of abuse she's now changed her name and runs a child rescue
[2:36:41.680 --> 2:36:46.200]  group you do this never ends remember like Sandusky separately running a
[2:36:46.200 --> 2:36:50.280]  child help group it's the same story the Catholic Church all of it they're not
[2:36:50.280 --> 2:36:53.880]  saying the Catholic Church never raped anybody so they've taken pizza gate and
[2:36:53.880 --> 2:36:57.720]  I figured it out as their cause celeb that none of this happened in Muslims
[2:36:57.720 --> 2:37:00.920]  come in and rape people now if you say they do once in the newspaper they
[2:37:00.920 --> 2:37:07.440]  threaten to sue or sue that's going on as we speak today so we've entered a new
[2:37:07.440 --> 2:37:12.880]  world folks where you see salon and the medias and Nickelodeon sexualizing
[2:37:12.880 --> 2:37:17.200]  children they're going operational they want us to know it's the new right we're
[2:37:17.200 --> 2:37:20.240]  not just going to put trainees in your bathroom and I'm not against trainees
[2:37:20.240 --> 2:37:23.920]  that aren't pedophiles but you know a 40 year old male with your six-year-old
[2:37:23.920 --> 2:37:29.280]  the bathroom and then Cuomo says hey if he sees you know if your daughter sees
[2:37:29.280 --> 2:37:34.040]  his penis it doesn't like it that's her problem seriously let me tell you
[2:37:34.040 --> 2:37:36.880]  something I got daughters young daughters I some guy comes in and pulls
[2:37:36.880 --> 2:37:40.440]  his thing out buddy you better help police get there for a beach oh my god
[2:37:40.440 --> 2:37:44.640]  Jones threatens false cuz trannies no I said against people pulling their
[2:37:44.640 --> 2:37:48.880]  weenies out with with little girls in bathrooms okay but that's how they've
[2:37:48.880 --> 2:37:52.960]  got us through political correctness at this point so I'm ranting but I want to
[2:37:52.960 --> 2:37:57.120]  give first as a gateway cuz you know tomorrow and then right through Friday
[2:37:57.120 --> 2:38:00.000]  next week we got like five or six reports you're gonna be premiering each day on
[2:38:00.000 --> 2:38:03.000]  the nightly news the next day here Millie you're gonna be with us every day
[2:38:03.000 --> 2:38:06.680]  Gavin's welcome to come in he's a shy guy but really smart obviously Owen's
[2:38:06.680 --> 2:38:11.000]  really pissed off about this but here's a giant 19-page report about sex
[2:38:11.000 --> 2:38:14.880]  slavery and the UN running it that's all they ever do that's what they do that's
[2:38:14.880 --> 2:38:18.520]  their business everywhere they go they do this whether it's Eastern Europe
[2:38:18.520 --> 2:38:21.480]  whether it's Africa whether it's the Caribbean whether it's Latin America
[2:38:21.480 --> 2:38:26.280]  whether it's Asia this is what they do so we should probably hit this first then
[2:38:26.280 --> 2:38:31.120]  just give people a forte into what's coming out the next week here every day
[2:38:31.120 --> 2:38:38.000]  with the bombshell bona fides well Alex it didn't surprise me to find out that
[2:38:38.000 --> 2:38:43.120]  the story came out of Haiti right somehow I wasn't surprised by foundation and
[2:38:43.120 --> 2:38:46.840]  then you go on and you learn about this and you read about this this was going
[2:38:46.840 --> 2:38:53.160]  on for over a decade and not only was this going on even when the UN found out
[2:38:53.160 --> 2:38:59.120]  that there were reports of this going on they still allowed it to go on even when
[2:38:59.120 --> 2:39:03.160]  they said they were doing investigations they still allowed the commandos that
[2:39:03.160 --> 2:39:07.000]  were coming in from Sri Lanka and other places to come in and commit these
[2:39:07.000 --> 2:39:12.760]  heinous sex acts now this 19 page report gets into detail about some of the
[2:39:12.760 --> 2:39:19.600]  stories they keep a lot of the victims names obviously out of this and the UN
[2:39:19.600 --> 2:39:25.360]  still keeps classified some of the abusers so wait a minute no and in says
[2:39:25.360 --> 2:39:29.080]  child sex abuse does not exist well let me tell you Alex ever it never happened
[2:39:29.080 --> 2:39:35.640]  let me tell you Alex you know they don't really get into exactly how it ends up
[2:39:35.640 --> 2:39:41.400]  going down but what you take away from this is without a doubt the UN gets in
[2:39:41.400 --> 2:39:46.160]  they create a stronghold and you have people that come in and take advantage
[2:39:46.160 --> 2:39:53.120]  of this program commandos volunteers are not pedophiles the UN
[2:39:53.120 --> 2:39:57.880]  peacekeeping force specifically attracts them I have seen thousands I've
[2:39:57.880 --> 2:40:01.760]  put the film's out my first film America's War by Design has the photos
[2:40:01.760 --> 2:40:05.840]  from the German press they would even show it here of Belgian peacekeepers
[2:40:05.840 --> 2:40:10.680]  raping children and then slitting their throats that see the Satanists there's
[2:40:10.680 --> 2:40:14.200]  the deal they're not just raping they slit their throats while they rape them
[2:40:14.200 --> 2:40:18.440]  so the you join the UN peacekeeper force that's why our military so upset
[2:40:18.440 --> 2:40:23.520]  about the UN to carry this out so people anybody Google UN troops kill
[2:40:23.520 --> 2:40:28.720]  children UN troops sex slavery babies dinecore loading them on planes
[2:40:28.720 --> 2:40:32.920]  congressional hearings I mean it but they always use national security or
[2:40:32.920 --> 2:40:36.600]  UN diplomatic immunity to hide it because they're about the law well and they
[2:40:36.600 --> 2:40:40.880]  caught UN officials in New York and Houston with kidnapped kids from the
[2:40:40.880 --> 2:40:46.480]  neighborhood in their houses in in basements they even get caught bringing
[2:40:46.480 --> 2:40:52.480]  slaves in in chains through customs but because it's but it's Muslim culture to
[2:40:52.480 --> 2:40:56.320]  do that so it's okay so but now if you look at the overarching picture you have
[2:40:56.320 --> 2:40:59.560]  to ask why is the United States government still working with the UN and
[2:40:59.560 --> 2:41:02.880]  the likes of Dinecorp but Alex I mean this the numbers in here are just
[2:41:02.880 --> 2:41:05.680]  appalling and again it's out of Haiti I thought that the Clinton Foundation was
[2:41:05.680 --> 2:41:10.160]  in Haiti setting up hospitals setting up schools trying to industrialize this
[2:41:10.160 --> 2:41:13.800]  nation what a bunch of bull crap by like there's the Guardian killing and raping
[2:41:13.800 --> 2:41:18.880]  it's killing they they're killing it's human sacrifice during 12 years the
[2:41:18.880 --> 2:41:22.720]  Associated Press found nearly 2,000 allegations of sexual abuse and
[2:41:22.720 --> 2:41:26.440]  exploitation by peacekeepers and other personnel around the world and that's
[2:41:26.440 --> 2:41:30.440]  just in Haiti and these are people that come in from Brazil people that come in
[2:41:30.440 --> 2:41:35.400]  from Sri Lanka people that come in from Nepal all over the world in Haiti at
[2:41:35.400 --> 2:41:39.960]  least 134 Sri Lankan peacekeepers exploited nine children in a sex ring
[2:41:39.960 --> 2:41:46.160]  from 2004 to 2007 so in Haiti now in the United States or in industrialized
[2:41:46.160 --> 2:41:50.200]  countries as you're talking about Alex these are UN power brokers who basically
[2:41:50.200 --> 2:41:53.280]  feel like they have the rights to do whatever they want by the way maybe one
[2:41:53.280 --> 2:41:56.400]  out of a thousand of these cases just reported in the third world they say
[2:41:56.400 --> 2:42:00.880]  300 cases in just one year and that's the key Alex I mean it is a it is folks
[2:42:00.880 --> 2:42:05.760]  reportedly UN camps are literally like Satan's parlor there's nothing these
[2:42:05.760 --> 2:42:08.840]  there's nothing these victims can do they can't do anything they don't have
[2:42:08.840 --> 2:42:11.480]  any money they don't have an infrastructure they don't have a lawyer
[2:42:11.480 --> 2:42:15.520]  they don't have a police officer nothing and where is all the US where's all the
[2:42:15.520 --> 2:42:21.080]  so-called BAT and all the black groups zero zero zero Soros is funding you know
[2:42:21.080 --> 2:42:24.440]  randomly go kill a copper whatever while the real attacks on black people but
[2:42:24.440 --> 2:42:27.880]  it's in Europe Eastern Europe folks I mean the women there are obviously at a
[2:42:27.880 --> 2:42:32.120]  premium they're being grabbed in mass ladies and gentlemen it is and again
[2:42:32.120 --> 2:42:35.680]  what's crazy is just 10 years ago this was all over the news remember it's gone
[2:42:35.680 --> 2:42:40.400]  you don't hear about this anymore and how about this from the UN they sent some
[2:42:40.400 --> 2:42:43.720]  peacekeepers home that they found were involved in these alleged sexual
[2:42:43.720 --> 2:42:47.840]  abuses zero got a punishment zero were in prison imprisoned and all of their
[2:42:47.840 --> 2:42:51.760]  use run by pedophile ranks it's mainstream news even admits that now
[2:42:51.760 --> 2:42:55.440]  now before I forget how to get to this yesterday international business times
[2:42:55.440 --> 2:43:00.040]  others admitted they're selling girls as young as six in the sex slavery that
[2:43:00.040 --> 2:43:03.400]  are kidnapped in Libya after Hillary's liberation that wouldn't happen under
[2:43:03.400 --> 2:43:06.240]  Gaddafi 60% of graduates were women didn't wear hoods over their heads
[2:43:06.240 --> 2:43:11.520]  everything that's a fact after the break we should probably play that clip of the
[2:43:11.520 --> 2:43:16.360]  women being sold to sex slavery in Libya it's video but again Colbert and others
[2:43:16.360 --> 2:43:21.840]  make jokes about this and they can use the coverings to kind to hide that some
[2:43:21.840 --> 2:43:26.000]  of these people are in fact missing people in traffic like I've heard
[2:43:26.000 --> 2:43:30.440]  stories about people going missing and being sex trafficked to Saudi Arabia to
[2:43:30.440 --> 2:43:34.400]  service why the muscles began covering women because they have them hooded on
[2:43:34.400 --> 2:43:38.320]  the caravan so no one will recognize yeah exactly it wasn't too long ago
[2:43:38.320 --> 2:43:45.360]  caravans the Wahhabis were a kidnapping sex trade white slavery group yeah I
[2:43:45.360 --> 2:43:49.880]  mean they trafficked women from India all the way into Europe there's a lot of
[2:43:49.880 --> 2:43:54.320]  history of that with within the Ottoman Empire where they would actually you're
[2:43:54.320 --> 2:43:57.840]  right they would steal women from Italy from all other places they would
[2:43:57.840 --> 2:44:00.960]  conquer they would steal the women and children and they bring them back a lot
[2:44:00.960 --> 2:44:04.440]  of them would end up being part of harems are sold into like Vikings they
[2:44:04.440 --> 2:44:08.640]  would pull up at night in a village and grab everybody yeah exactly and it
[2:44:08.640 --> 2:44:14.040]  wasn't too long ago that in Haiti they actually had rescued some children that
[2:44:14.040 --> 2:44:17.160]  they were trying to these traffickers were trying to move them across the
[2:44:17.160 --> 2:44:19.840]  border before they got caught and they wouldn't found out that they were
[2:44:19.840 --> 2:44:24.480]  selling these children on the dark web for about $300 a piece from Haiti so
[2:44:24.480 --> 2:44:31.200]  that's just more of $300 and sorry go ahead yeah it's it's pretty disturbing
[2:44:31.200 --> 2:44:34.920]  and it just reminds me of some of the videos that we're gonna be showing
[2:44:34.920 --> 2:44:39.720]  coming out this week it shows inside the dark web now it doesn't go to some of
[2:44:39.720 --> 2:44:44.880]  these sites specifically because they are a law enforcement group involved
[2:44:44.880 --> 2:44:48.720]  group we had authorization to go there we did not go on the side we didn't go on
[2:44:48.720 --> 2:44:53.280]  it but this was a law enforcement approved group they um yeah they work
[2:44:53.280 --> 2:44:57.400]  with trafficking victims they have like therapy certificates I mean they're so
[2:44:57.400 --> 2:45:02.360]  basically what it is is we didn't actually go on the specific child sites
[2:45:02.360 --> 2:45:06.120]  because that could be against a law on the portals we actually went to show on
[2:45:06.120 --> 2:45:10.120]  the portals where they have kind of like a TV guide but somewhat like a guide for
[2:45:10.120 --> 2:45:16.960]  the dark web and the what they call the child pedophile pornography sites they
[2:45:16.960 --> 2:45:21.240]  call them hard candy so that's like a term and like how we saw I mean it
[2:45:21.240 --> 2:45:23.800]  reminds me a little bit of some of the terms but they actually call them hard
[2:45:23.800 --> 2:45:28.480]  candy on the internet which I found to be in the media will pick a hard candy
[2:45:28.480 --> 2:45:35.040]  shop and say we're saying a hard candy shop you know in in wherever is doing it
[2:45:35.040 --> 2:45:38.520]  and then say oh my god a gunman went the hard candy shop so we're not saying the
[2:45:38.520 --> 2:45:41.760]  code words hard candy they met with law enforcement they met with the sheriff's
[2:45:41.760 --> 2:45:45.280]  department tell folks about some people you met with we also met with some
[2:45:45.280 --> 2:45:49.560]  Hollywood insiders which kind of confirms some stories and and did say
[2:45:49.560 --> 2:45:55.040]  that they had witnessed that there are a lot of people and young children being
[2:45:55.040 --> 2:45:59.640]  sex trafficked in the Hollywood LA area I mean they said down on Sepulveda
[2:45:59.640 --> 2:46:03.440]  Boulevard you can see just all these young girls on the street there and
[2:46:03.440 --> 2:46:09.520]  actually to where in Anaheim a group of citizens had to actually form a human
[2:46:09.520 --> 2:46:15.000]  chain to block these johns from coming into this hotel where they knew that
[2:46:15.000 --> 2:46:19.680]  these children and young people were being sex trafficked out of a hotel in
[2:46:19.680 --> 2:46:25.040]  Anaheim and again that's 13 14 15 year old girls that's horrible that's in
[2:46:25.040 --> 2:46:29.600]  plain view imagine what's going on in the you know other exactly and we did
[2:46:29.600 --> 2:46:35.040]  have I mean this Hollywood insider knows a lot of celebrities and has heard
[2:46:35.040 --> 2:46:42.560]  things about young children young boys being molested basically by people in
[2:46:42.560 --> 2:46:48.640]  high positions and it was actually very surprising to me that he kind of in a
[2:46:48.640 --> 2:46:53.320]  sense just from this person's opinion kind of confirms some of those
[2:46:53.320 --> 2:46:57.320]  allegations on Michael Jackson which was kind of pretty crazy sure well let's
[2:46:57.320 --> 2:47:00.560]  we have the Jesus just give me a break I've got a playland in this house kids
[2:47:00.560 --> 2:47:04.400]  sleeping with him yeah you did go to some of the orphanages some of them
[2:47:04.400 --> 2:47:08.240]  groups you wouldn't mess with the police I tell us about some of the videos the
[2:47:08.240 --> 2:47:12.680]  reports that are coming out well actually I wanted to just clarify we had started
[2:47:12.680 --> 2:47:16.040]  making arrangements with the police and then the police just backed out
[2:47:16.040 --> 2:47:19.400]  completely and completely ignored us last time I talked to the sheriff's
[2:47:19.400 --> 2:47:24.120]  department so they but but you know what hearing about what Owen just brought up
[2:47:24.120 --> 2:47:27.560]  with the UN and and their corruption in that and then actually talking to with
[2:47:27.560 --> 2:47:31.600]  this woman from Children of the Night how she's had problems with law
[2:47:31.600 --> 2:47:36.160]  enforcement and how actually they were criminalizing these young children it
[2:47:36.160 --> 2:47:39.880]  wasn't too long ago that these children were treated as criminals for
[2:47:39.880 --> 2:47:43.960]  prostituting themselves and they were actually thrown in jail so even young
[2:47:43.960 --> 2:47:47.280]  kids that were like maybe like ten years old eight years old that's a way to keep
[2:47:47.280 --> 2:47:50.160]  it underground and to be clear yeah the police go bust the groups it should be all
[2:47:50.160 --> 2:47:53.080]  over the news it'll be the news one time the never again they're getting told not
[2:47:53.080 --> 2:47:55.840]  to talk to and what it is is she said the police were excited when you first got
[2:47:55.840 --> 2:47:59.680]  there yeah I did the police were excited but then they just kind of blew us off
[2:47:59.680 --> 2:48:03.880]  and we contacted them over and over and over again and then what this lady was
[2:48:03.880 --> 2:48:06.840]  kind of telling me is that you know the police will rescue these children from
[2:48:06.840 --> 2:48:10.200]  the traffickers and then what do they do they just shove them right back out on
[2:48:10.200 --> 2:48:13.960]  the street so then what they get back up in and then they make this big like
[2:48:13.960 --> 2:48:17.680]  grandstanding that oh we're doing all these human trafficking bus for rescuing
[2:48:17.680 --> 2:48:20.200]  these children and then you just throw them right back out on the street into
[2:48:20.200 --> 2:48:23.160]  the environment I was talking to some folks who are involved in bringing these
[2:48:23.160 --> 2:48:27.040]  groups actually down the higher levels and they said that you've got to go after
[2:48:27.040 --> 2:48:30.160]  the people that are controlling it you know the highest they could ever get is
[2:48:30.160 --> 2:48:34.800]  say the hotel or whatever group they're in that's the controller you can't ever
[2:48:34.800 --> 2:48:38.360]  get above it because the investigations get killed yeah and you know what we
[2:48:38.360 --> 2:48:41.800]  kind of did confirm though from some of our investigations that this is
[2:48:41.800 --> 2:48:46.240]  something that tends to be more so even amongst the elite and some of the elite
[2:48:46.240 --> 2:48:49.760]  members of society we've been talking to regular regular people it's heterosexual
[2:48:49.760 --> 2:48:52.800]  stuff and then it's a lot rare homosexual and then it goes in the
[2:48:52.800 --> 2:48:55.840]  pedophilia I mean we've been talking with someone who has connections with
[2:48:55.840 --> 2:49:00.960]  multiple intelligence agencies is actually investigating a serial killer
[2:49:00.960 --> 2:49:04.960]  murder that's like that they believe is one of these children that has been
[2:49:04.960 --> 2:49:08.960]  sex traffic that kind of snapped and is now a serial murder for these travel
[2:49:08.960 --> 2:49:13.760]  clubs and the crazy thing about this is you know like some of these people that
[2:49:13.760 --> 2:49:18.160]  we've talked to have even admitted to themselves being kind of made to be
[2:49:18.160 --> 2:49:22.840]  page boys or sex slaves to some pretty influential people which I'm not going to
[2:49:22.840 --> 2:49:28.600]  say right now on but it's pretty I mean that's why I don't like your legs
[2:49:28.600 --> 2:49:32.760]  people tell you point blank what's going on oh and what is it like for you to be
[2:49:32.760 --> 2:49:36.080]  investigating this and just seeing this and then to see more and more the media
[2:49:36.080 --> 2:49:41.720]  defending it or saying it doesn't exist well as you know pizza gate is not about
[2:49:41.720 --> 2:49:46.480]  a lone pizza joint it's much deeper than that and before you started looking
[2:49:46.480 --> 2:49:50.600]  into this stuff you would be shocked that people like Dennis Hastert exist or
[2:49:50.600 --> 2:49:54.080]  that Laura Sillsby that's a fact convicted pedophile procuring kids for
[2:49:54.080 --> 2:49:58.760]  the elite that's a fact that Jerry at the church fact Jerry Sandusky fact sorry
[2:49:58.760 --> 2:50:02.320]  Jerry Epstein flies Bill Clinton out to his private island Bill Clinton ditches
[2:50:02.320 --> 2:50:04.720]  his secret service I mean it's just stuff it just goes on and on and then you
[2:50:04.720 --> 2:50:07.120]  find out the Clinton connection with Laura Sillsby and then you look into
[2:50:07.120 --> 2:50:11.200]  what's going on in Haiti and you're just sitting here like how can this go on it's
[2:50:11.200 --> 2:50:15.800]  a massive industrial operation how can I feel so helpless to save these kids how
[2:50:15.800 --> 2:50:19.440]  can I feel so helpless and then we're being demonized by the media for even
[2:50:19.440 --> 2:50:24.160]  looking into it and and and all we do is point out facts all we do is try to get
[2:50:24.160 --> 2:50:27.600]  to the bottom of this and you know it's like that's like coming out and saying
[2:50:27.600 --> 2:50:31.480]  all the Associated Press report is just they're just hate Haiti they just start
[2:50:31.480 --> 2:50:34.680]  looking to blame Haiti it's Haiti no they're out here investigating what's
[2:50:34.680 --> 2:50:38.600]  going on in Haiti it probably goes on all over the world it's just guess what
[2:50:38.600 --> 2:50:41.880]  Haiti's such a mess right now they've been caught in so many illegal things
[2:50:41.880 --> 2:50:44.520]  that they're able to find this investigation and the Clintons and their
[2:50:44.520 --> 2:50:47.920]  people are all over it with child traffickers getting convicted when we
[2:50:47.920 --> 2:50:51.960]  come back you got into the place that nobody gets into and we won't reveal
[2:50:51.960 --> 2:50:55.880]  obviously sources and methods but we we've got the actual devil worship
[2:50:55.880 --> 2:51:00.680]  manuals that the that the devil worshiper rips one can't get paying off

[2:56:47.120 --> 2:56:51.800]  doubt that the that Hollywood wasn't into pedophilia you should just look at
[2:56:51.800 --> 2:56:57.520]  people like Jay-Z, Keisha, Katy Perry, Beyonce, so on and so forth and they have
[2:56:57.520 --> 2:57:01.560]  what do they have they have these Alistair Crowley occult symbols all
[2:57:01.560 --> 2:57:04.840]  throughout their music they were shirts that have to do with that wilt they
[2:57:04.840 --> 2:57:09.280]  they literally have these satanic rituals they meet with Marina Abramovich
[2:57:09.280 --> 2:57:13.400]  they meet with Marina Abramovich I mean we have Lady Gaga and here here are
[2:57:13.400 --> 2:57:18.400]  these satanic manuscripts now I'm gonna get into this this is an image this is
[2:57:18.400 --> 2:57:21.920]  not something that's easy to get ahold of these were some in fact this is being
[2:57:21.920 --> 2:57:26.600]  seen for the first time yeah these are these are manuscripts that were held by
[2:57:26.600 --> 2:57:32.640]  Manly P. Hall who was an amazing guardian of literature I mean he helped start a
[2:57:32.640 --> 2:57:37.520]  library the philosophical research society in LA that had a vast amount of
[2:57:37.520 --> 2:57:42.120]  books and manuscripts and literature and he didn't only collect these satanic
[2:57:42.120 --> 2:57:46.600]  black magic books but he collected everything and he collected these books
[2:57:46.600 --> 2:57:52.680]  for educational purposes however he had several attempts in cases where these
[2:57:52.680 --> 2:57:58.000]  satanic Alistair Crowley groups would actually try to break in and steal these
[2:57:58.000 --> 2:58:02.880]  manuscripts because they taught about how to perform these child sex sacrifice
[2:58:02.880 --> 2:58:06.000]  rituals as you can see you've got babies laying on the floor and that's how it's
[2:58:06.000 --> 2:58:09.520]  done folks I've seen manuscripts that nobody else has seen and let me tell
[2:58:09.520 --> 2:58:13.840]  you these I've got these are really old this is how they do it these are
[2:58:13.840 --> 2:58:17.940]  hundreds of years old this is something that's been being practiced in elite
[2:58:17.940 --> 2:58:24.040]  is that out of France hundreds of years that French I don't think so it is as
[2:58:24.040 --> 2:58:27.960]  far as I know it is not French but it is hundreds of years old and well
[2:58:27.960 --> 2:58:31.560]  well let's be clear Manly P. Hall again get their biases over this big satanist
[2:58:31.560 --> 2:58:34.320]  whatever and I'm certainly not endorsing everything he did but he was somebody
[2:58:34.320 --> 2:58:37.240]  that was just in the pantheistically researching everything but he does does
[2:58:37.240 --> 2:58:40.240]  have that giant library that ended up at the Getty Center which you guys got
[2:58:40.240 --> 2:58:43.440]  exclusive access to that we're gonna be put preparing to not on the mountain is
[2:58:43.440 --> 2:58:46.920]  yeah but he was not a satanist by any means sure and I understand that's what
[2:58:46.920 --> 2:58:51.360]  the museum saying hey I appreciate exactly I appreciate the product DNA
[2:58:51.360 --> 2:58:56.040]  force that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce
[2:58:56.040 --> 2:59:00.080]  about a group you took years for you to develop DNA force for us it's been
[2:59:00.080 --> 2:59:03.440]  something that I've been working on for a long time Alex because I think it's
[2:59:03.440 --> 2:59:08.440]  very very important what the aging process is is when the cell replicates
[2:59:08.440 --> 2:59:13.600]  we lose a little bit of our telomeres telomeres are the little cups on the end
[2:59:13.600 --> 2:59:17.800]  of our chromosomes but when it runs out you start dying we chose the PQQ because
[2:59:17.800 --> 2:59:22.240]  it has over 175 different clinical trials it's one of the most effective
[2:59:22.240 --> 2:59:27.040]  substances in the world it works like an antioxidant it works to repair nerve
[2:59:27.040 --> 2:59:31.600]  growth factor so this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount it's in

[3:00:11.000 --> 3:00:18.640]  network
[3:00:18.640 --> 3:00:22.320]  all right Roger Stone's coming up and he's actually a little late getting back
[3:00:22.320 --> 3:00:26.040]  in the studio so that that's fine we're gonna continue on Millie Weaver with your
[3:00:26.040 --> 3:00:29.720]  contacts in Los Angeles I don't know if anybody that's gotten into the Getty
[3:00:29.720 --> 3:00:32.960]  Center there and the actual works of Manly P. Hall I know some folks that
[3:00:32.960 --> 3:00:35.800]  would who aren't on the Satanist side of the Christian side that would you
[3:00:35.800 --> 3:00:39.960]  probably kill metaphorically to get in to see those so you've got the floor you
[3:00:39.960 --> 3:00:44.280]  were kind of ranting during the break lay this out well basically Manly P.
[3:00:44.280 --> 3:00:48.600]  Hall himself was not a Satanist he was just somebody who was an academic and
[3:00:48.600 --> 3:00:52.760]  really into literature manuscripts he collected he had like his own mini
[3:00:52.760 --> 3:00:57.720]  library of Alexandria it was Alistair Crowley that he loathed and actually
[3:00:57.720 --> 3:01:00.920]  when his students would come to him and say hey you know I'm interested in
[3:01:00.920 --> 3:01:04.200]  dabbling in this stuff he would actually pull out a handwritten letter that he
[3:01:04.200 --> 3:01:08.840]  had of Alistair Crowley's it was actually a poem basically of Alistair
[3:01:08.840 --> 3:01:12.920]  Crowley being a pedophile and in expressing his pedophile lusts and
[3:01:12.920 --> 3:01:16.720]  wants and it was absolutely disgusting so well probably reportedly killed his own
[3:01:16.720 --> 3:01:22.080]  son well you know Crowley was just sick I mean if you actually read some of the
[3:01:22.080 --> 3:01:26.560]  stuff it was a pathetic wimp just like people worship Kim Jong-un he was a
[3:01:26.560 --> 3:01:32.600]  Kim Jong-un weak pathetic scumbag exactly he was disgusting and so these
[3:01:32.600 --> 3:01:36.560]  discussing satanic groups would actually try and get their hands on these
[3:01:36.560 --> 3:01:41.000]  manuscripts and Manly P. Hall actually bought them up and hoarded them to
[3:01:41.000 --> 3:01:45.200]  protect them from these satanic groups and actually he had a very untimely
[3:01:45.200 --> 3:01:49.520]  mysterious death when these satanic groups wanted these manuscripts they
[3:01:49.520 --> 3:01:54.160]  actually in his old age tricked him into signing over the rights of these
[3:01:54.160 --> 3:02:00.200]  manuals to him and then he died mysteriously very odd you know after
[3:02:00.200 --> 3:02:03.320]  that and while there is this investigation into his murder and it was
[3:02:03.320 --> 3:02:07.400]  untimely death and they were suing over that they wanted these satanic
[3:02:07.400 --> 3:02:12.320]  manuscripts his ex-wife or his widow should I say she had to battle them in
[3:02:12.320 --> 3:02:15.280]  court and she ended up selling them to the Getty instead of giving them to
[3:02:15.280 --> 3:02:20.240]  these satanic groups where they could be held and kept more safely but it's not
[3:02:20.240 --> 3:02:22.960]  getting in the means I mean I know you've told me some of the stuff it's off
[3:02:22.960 --> 3:02:27.120]  record but interesting how you guys got in to be able to see all this yeah you
[3:02:27.120 --> 3:02:31.320]  know we were actually able to get in and see this stuff because we had
[3:02:31.320 --> 3:02:37.280]  established rapport with people at PRS through an academic perspective and they
[3:02:37.280 --> 3:02:40.480]  were like okay you know they've had people come in and do hit pieces just to
[3:02:40.480 --> 3:02:45.560]  just in general do a hit piece on masonry but in actuality these Alistair
[3:02:45.560 --> 3:02:49.440]  Crowley satanists they call themselves masons but in reality Alistair Crowley
[3:02:49.440 --> 3:02:54.040]  himself was rejected and I want to say this that's why I mean you know some of
[3:02:54.040 --> 3:02:57.520]  my family have been masons great-grandfather stuff high-level masons
[3:02:57.520 --> 3:03:01.480]  they're the ones that found a Texas that founded America George Washington was a
[3:03:01.480 --> 3:03:06.080]  mason he wrote letters against the satanic takeover of masonry and against
[3:03:06.080 --> 3:03:09.000]  the French Revolution he warned Thomas Jefferson but they later tried to kill
[3:03:09.000 --> 3:03:12.120]  in France he came back and kind of woke up because Thomas Jefferson was the head
[3:03:12.120 --> 3:03:14.960]  of the Illuminati people say whoa I thought Thomas Jefferson is good every
[3:03:14.960 --> 3:03:19.120]  there's a counterfeit the globalist have their Illuminati and a lot of the
[3:03:19.120 --> 3:03:24.560]  stuff isn't even books this is just known through Americana lore and and and so
[3:03:24.560 --> 3:03:31.640]  I'm not in the Illuminati but America was founded by the real Illuminati and so
[3:03:31.640 --> 3:03:36.520]  then all Americans who are really for the Republic are in the Illuminati but
[3:03:36.520 --> 3:03:40.480]  not in the Illuminati of the globalist that is the false Illuminati
[3:03:40.480 --> 3:03:45.840]  illuminated just means light God but the devil was the lightbearer of God he
[3:03:45.840 --> 3:03:49.560]  kind of caught God's light so he's the false God like Christ is referred to as
[3:03:49.560 --> 3:03:55.040]  the morning star so is Lucifer because he's the false Christ and so people
[3:03:55.040 --> 3:03:57.800]  understand that there's bad stuff in mainstream because it's been taken over
[3:03:57.800 --> 3:04:02.120]  by this but if you look at masonry it's just ancient colleges because it was
[3:04:02.120 --> 3:04:05.840]  called the mystery schools good and bad because they didn't just give everybody
[3:04:05.840 --> 3:04:10.760]  knowledge of mathematics or weapons or farming or culture you had to be into
[3:04:10.760 --> 3:04:16.080]  the secret right to be able to get into a university and so you know the Masons
[3:04:16.080 --> 3:04:20.880]  today get demonized and things projected on them I'm not a Mason just like I'm
[3:04:20.880 --> 3:04:24.540]  not in any intelligence agency but I know everything the Masons basically know
[3:04:24.540 --> 3:04:27.920]  and I know everything that basically the intelligence agencies know but only
[3:04:27.920 --> 3:04:32.400]  because I've organically grown up in the Republic so it's a spiritual thing and
[3:04:32.400 --> 3:04:36.480]  again it's all deception with them where they've got everybody believing that the
[3:04:36.480 --> 3:04:41.360]  Masons are devil worshipers when in truth the Masons were only the colleges or
[3:04:41.360 --> 3:04:44.880]  intelligence agencies their age and they could either be good or bad or a mix
[3:04:44.880 --> 3:04:48.000]  of them so when we come back I want you to speak to that and then I want sure
[3:04:48.000 --> 3:04:51.640]  you've been polite sitting over there we'll talk about it straight ahead but
[3:04:51.640 --> 3:04:55.480]  we're here to not just have illumination for those that are the elite but
[3:04:55.480 --> 3:04:59.560]  illumination for all that want to know the truth
[3:05:00.760 --> 3:05:06.600]  the more things change the more they stay the same a few months ago president
[3:05:06.600 --> 3:05:11.520]  elect Donald Trump told an audience during his victory tour that his

[3:05:39.320 --> 3:05:45.000]  for Syria and Assad has changed very much well the only difference is this

[3:08:16.000 --> 3:08:23.480]  to Alex Jones I want to be clear I'm giving people historical
[3:08:23.480 --> 3:08:29.200]  irrefutable facts that any historian knows that studied Solomon's temple or
[3:08:29.200 --> 3:08:37.560]  the first colleges that were in Greece and in northern Africa in Egypt or in
[3:08:37.560 --> 3:08:41.040]  Babylon they're on the Tiger Street Fridays I'm not endorsing those mystery
[3:08:41.040 --> 3:08:47.120]  schools and what they were doing this is pre-Christianity pre-Judaism and so
[3:08:47.120 --> 3:08:51.400]  those mystery schools go through Judaism and other cultures as well and
[3:08:51.400 --> 3:08:55.120]  religions and then George Washington wrote letters about this and exposed
[3:08:55.120 --> 3:09:00.120]  that the Satanists who did the most heartable acts as he talks about it
[3:09:00.120 --> 3:09:03.600]  were taking over masonry not that masonry was ever perfect it's just not
[3:09:03.600 --> 3:09:08.520]  fair to say masonry was all a bunch of Satanism and then or masonry is
[3:09:08.520 --> 3:09:12.800]  totally perfect and so I mean I've been part of documentaries of the
[3:09:12.800 --> 3:09:16.760]  Belfastry Channel Discovery Channel you know dealing with masonry just from my
[3:09:16.760 --> 3:09:21.040]  real research of it you know I even had family and stuff that said don't become
[3:09:21.040 --> 3:09:27.320]  a mason it's really become bad so that's how corrupt it's gotten so so but
[3:09:27.320 --> 3:09:29.720]  I mean we've got Roger Stone coming up it's a little bit late he's gonna be
[3:09:29.720 --> 3:09:33.240]  ready in about three minutes Millie this is coming up tonight premiering some of
[3:09:33.240 --> 3:09:35.720]  this other reports and then oh and jump in here whenever you want yeah I just
[3:09:35.720 --> 3:09:40.000]  wanted to clarify one thing and kind of ask this rhetorical question why would
[3:09:40.000 --> 3:09:44.920]  these celebrity elites be so into Satanism well it's really quite simple
[3:09:44.920 --> 3:09:50.600]  Hollywood elites are also really into staying young looking young living for a
[3:09:50.600 --> 3:09:55.800]  long time immortality and what it boils down to is that these were supposedly
[3:09:55.800 --> 3:10:00.560]  like the amongst these satanic elite the secret to immortality is secret to
[3:10:00.560 --> 3:10:04.520]  staying young looking young they think that if they perform these rituals on
[3:10:04.520 --> 3:10:09.280]  these babies and kill them in a certain way and then harvest their blood and
[3:10:09.280 --> 3:10:14.880]  drink it that they will then be younger and rejuvenated a long time there's
[3:10:14.880 --> 3:10:19.600]  Egyptian manuscripts on this one you've got evil was it was pituitary glands the
[3:10:19.600 --> 3:10:23.080]  blood it was the original growth armor and and and the theory behind this
[3:10:23.080 --> 3:10:26.520]  manuscript is that the man who wrote it lived to be like 200 years old I mean
[3:10:26.520 --> 3:10:29.560]  there's some weird theory which I don't know if I even believe but they say he
[3:10:29.560 --> 3:10:32.960]  lived to be 200 years old because he drank baby's blood and it's the same way
[3:10:32.960 --> 3:10:36.480]  we see people using stem cells today and you have Hollywood celebrities where
[3:10:36.480 --> 3:10:40.000]  they go and get these stem cell treatments from aborted fetuses but
[3:10:40.000 --> 3:10:43.800]  Seattle went for David Bowie he looked great but then he died yeah I mean we're
[3:10:43.800 --> 3:10:47.360]  doing it exactly today when you see these aborted fetuses that are being
[3:10:47.360 --> 3:10:52.320]  hired China sells you know the powder made of dead babies and then the media
[3:10:52.320 --> 3:10:56.840]  makes jokes about it when we cover it yeah it's pretty disgusting Owen well
[3:10:56.840 --> 3:11:01.760]  the reason why we cover this disgusting news is to try to enlighten people and
[3:11:01.760 --> 3:11:06.080]  wake people up and try to get them in a call to action to try to make their
[3:11:06.080 --> 3:11:09.000]  world a better place not just ignore all the things that are going on right
[3:11:09.000 --> 3:11:12.480]  under their rug and you know Alex I'm reading this story and a few things
[3:11:12.480 --> 3:11:17.840]  really speak to me I'm reading about this Haitian lawyer Mario Joseph who's
[3:11:17.840 --> 3:11:22.720]  who's trying to get compensations to help victims of these peacekeepers that
[3:11:22.720 --> 3:11:26.560]  are spreading cholera to all these victims 10 over 10,000 people he's
[3:11:26.560 --> 3:11:30.080]  trying to get child support for all the Haitian women that got raped and then
[3:11:30.080 --> 3:11:34.640]  left pregnant he can't get the compensation meanwhile in Los Angeles
[3:11:34.640 --> 3:11:40.200]  and other liberal cities around America we have lawyers getting compensation
[3:11:40.200 --> 3:11:43.680]  from the government and private investors to stand up in court for
[3:11:43.680 --> 3:11:48.160]  illegal non-citizens folks but you can't even get this lawyer who's standing up
[3:11:48.160 --> 3:11:53.240]  for rape victims to get compensation or why is that or the giant water treatment
[3:11:53.240 --> 3:11:59.880]  facility that the UN used on purpose to swim in naked and crap in so also
[3:11:59.880 --> 3:12:04.400]  another thing that's out another thing that sticks out to me is there gonna be
[3:12:04.400 --> 3:12:07.440]  any mainstream media coverage on this I haven't seen it yet I've been made to
[3:12:07.440 --> 3:12:10.200]  I've been monitoring the news all day since this broke this morning I haven't
[3:12:10.200 --> 3:12:14.880]  seen it on Fox CNN MSNBC nowhere nowhere on the hill on C-span and it goes on
[3:12:14.880 --> 3:12:17.920]  Alex listen to this and I think we can all learn a few things from this here's
[3:12:17.920 --> 3:12:22.560]  another headline deported felon arrested in sexual abuse of a 12-year-old girl
[3:12:22.560 --> 3:12:26.840]  at Virginia daycare this is a man who had already been deported came back into
[3:12:26.840 --> 3:12:31.960]  Virginia and was raping a 12-year-old girl at a Virginia health care or
[3:12:31.960 --> 3:12:35.560]  excuse me daycare clinic listen to this Alex here's another story that came
[3:12:35.560 --> 3:12:40.800]  today tagging device found in human trafficking victim a young doctor known
[3:12:40.800 --> 3:12:44.320]  as doctor a couldn't help but roll his eyes when he read that his next patient
[3:12:44.320 --> 3:12:47.600]  claimed to have a GPS tracker implanted in her side of course right oh this is
[3:12:47.600 --> 3:12:50.800]  all crazy pedophilia running the world that's all crazy Satanism run the world
[3:12:50.800 --> 3:12:54.800]  it's all crazy that's the response guess what then you look into it you find out
[3:12:54.800 --> 3:12:58.000]  it's real sure enough the doctor looked into it did an investigation and guess
[3:12:58.000 --> 3:13:04.040]  what this young woman had an RFID chip in her this was a sex trafficking slave
[3:13:04.040 --> 3:13:08.600]  with an RFID chip in it that's how serious this stuff is okay this isn't
[3:13:08.600 --> 3:13:13.840]  some low-level stuff this is real stuff folks you don't implant an RFID chip
[3:13:13.840 --> 3:13:17.840]  into your sex slave unless you are some serious business by the way that's
[3:13:17.840 --> 3:13:22.160]  mainstream news and what's crazy is it breaks and gets no attention nothing I
[3:13:22.160 --> 3:13:26.760]  can't get anything this story broke this morning it took a few hours for it to
[3:13:26.760 --> 3:13:30.400]  get rolling on Twitter finally people on Twitter are reporting it I I'm telling
[3:13:30.400 --> 3:13:34.560]  you I've got all the mainstream news and c-span pulled up on my desk zero Alex
[3:13:34.560 --> 3:13:38.640]  oh they're so industrialized they've got the LATD report either I remember being
[3:13:38.640 --> 3:13:42.480]  told by people that had connections the CIA and of course it's been on the news
[3:13:42.480 --> 3:13:46.080]  that they took over 10,000 kids and literally reprogrammed their brains that
[3:13:46.080 --> 3:13:49.240]  was a doctor human camera that's even on history channel and they found all
[3:13:49.240 --> 3:13:52.960]  these chips in those women and that's what's crazy is that I've talked to the
[3:13:52.960 --> 3:13:56.720]  medical doctors that didn't believe it in Oklahoma where they were removing chips
[3:13:56.720 --> 3:14:04.720]  from little kids that were in foster care little little kids that just shows
[3:14:04.720 --> 3:14:08.760]  you how deep this goes because it's so industrialized yeah hundreds of thousands
[3:14:08.760 --> 3:14:12.040]  missing a year and they go oh they're all runaways no most of them aren't they
[3:14:12.040 --> 3:14:15.560]  the traffickers are like mafia so they have to scan to see whose property this
[3:14:15.560 --> 3:14:18.880]  is because a lot of these kids might be ten years old have been right for six
[3:14:18.880 --> 3:14:23.040]  seven years their minds going they put them on drugs they give them toxins so
[3:14:23.040 --> 3:14:25.640]  they're like zombies and then they have nothing they have no family they have no
[3:14:25.640 --> 3:14:28.160]  money they have nothing all they have is their holder well the word is people
[3:14:28.160 --> 3:14:31.760]  think Dahmer and I've talked to people that were involved with him in his
[3:14:31.760 --> 3:14:36.840]  Akhidrishan prison Dahmer they believe was probably a victim that's why he was
[3:14:36.840 --> 3:14:40.840]  trying to inject their brains with different chemicals trying to make them
[3:14:40.840 --> 3:14:45.840]  sex slaves like he'd seen I mean this is hardcore and a lot of connections just
[3:14:45.840 --> 3:14:51.160]  got made right there wow wow this is unbelievable Roger Stone is there is he
[3:14:51.160 --> 3:14:56.520]  there now good we're going to Roger Stone he was a little like it well this
[3:14:56.520 --> 3:14:59.840]  because he was on me last hour I appreciate Roger I just want to point
[3:14:59.840 --> 3:15:03.400]  out drudgerport.com and put it on screen Navy SEALs training to take out Kim
[3:15:03.400 --> 3:15:09.840]  Jeong-un listen we need to see 5,000 pound bunker busters on his ass I mean I'm
[3:15:09.840 --> 3:15:13.720]  not a tactician but I've studied it you do not need to send down Navy SEALs into
[3:15:13.720 --> 3:15:18.000]  some armed compound with 5,000 crazy North Koreans that is a suicide mission
[3:15:18.000 --> 3:15:24.120]  USA not bluffing hidden sub-threat nuke sniffer deployed yeah we broke that
[3:15:24.120 --> 3:15:29.080]  yesterday they got nuke sniffers planes out flying around and they've also got
[3:15:29.080 --> 3:15:32.080]  missiles being fired off our coast I mean this is just insane as hell in fact
[3:15:32.080 --> 3:15:36.760]  you know I've kind of gotten World War 3 fatigue I should have been all day
[3:15:36.760 --> 3:15:39.880]  people finally understand World War 3 could happen North Korea is not
[3:15:39.880 --> 3:15:43.440]  blinking China says they may nuke North Korea if they don't back off Russia
[3:15:43.440 --> 3:15:47.760]  Russia also has aircraft in the air right now around Japan and North Korea
[3:15:47.760 --> 3:15:52.520]  that can carry a nuclear load and that's I think why the US sent the nuclear
[3:15:52.520 --> 3:15:56.400]  tracing aircraft out there to try to monitor that and we saw some positive
[3:15:56.400 --> 3:16:00.080]  statements out of Russia today towards Trump like hey yeah let's clean up North
[3:16:00.080 --> 3:16:04.120]  Korea let's clean up in fact they're gonna get rid of Assad now Russia is I
[3:16:04.120 --> 3:16:07.120]  think Trump said hey we'll do business with you we'll end all this but we got
[3:16:07.120 --> 3:16:10.560]  to deal with these crazy people first thank you great job guys there's a
[3:16:10.560 --> 3:16:13.080]  live show kind of three if you want to be part of that let's talk about all this
[3:16:13.080 --> 3:16:16.140]  breaking stuff with Rob do and others it'll be on info wars.com so let's
[3:16:16.140 --> 3:16:20.120]  let's do it together. All right Alex. Great job. Thank you. Roger Stone thank
[3:16:20.120 --> 3:16:23.520]  you so much my friend I'm gonna skip this network break so you have more time

[3:16:26.520 --> 3:16:28.920]  rid of the fourth hour and start my own network but you know it's just
[3:16:28.920 --> 3:16:32.360]  while it works I love GCN but I want to give you your time back Roger Stone as
[3:16:32.360 --> 3:16:36.520]  you're a busy guy in high demand. Wow so much going on where do you want to
[3:16:36.520 --> 3:16:40.680]  begin I'm gonna turn the baton to you my friend. Yeah it's really hard to know
[3:16:40.680 --> 3:16:46.200]  where to start Alex I mean there's bombshell news today that should have
[3:16:46.200 --> 3:16:50.040]  the Obama administration and the Clintons quaking in their boots because
[3:16:50.040 --> 3:16:56.960]  Donald Trump does an interview with Maria Bartiromo in which he says that FBI
[3:16:56.960 --> 3:17:01.760]  director Comey saved Hillary's life by not bringing her up for
[3:17:01.760 --> 3:17:08.320]  prosecution that she would be on trial right now but for Mr. Comey but now he
[3:17:08.320 --> 3:17:12.960]  won't say as he had said previously that she shouldn't be investigated and tried
[3:17:12.960 --> 3:17:20.280]  on her various Clinton Foundation or email related scandals this is not good
[3:17:20.280 --> 3:17:24.920]  news for Mrs. Clinton you'll remember Alex what they told us to the end of
[3:17:24.920 --> 3:17:30.880]  Watergate no person is above the law and then you have President Trump seeming
[3:17:30.880 --> 3:17:36.360]  to throw our friend Steve Bannon under the bus as you correctly pointed out I
[3:17:36.360 --> 3:17:40.440]  want to get this right there's actually I think four stages it's who is Steve
[3:17:40.440 --> 3:17:45.840]  Bannon what do you think of Steve Bannon then it's what our people saying
[3:17:45.840 --> 3:17:51.360]  about Steve Bannon and then I really don't know Steve Bannon I'm afraid that's
[3:17:51.360 --> 3:17:57.160]  the continuum we are now in Steve's a friend and I think I probably as you do
[3:17:57.160 --> 3:18:03.200]  share his worldview more certainly than some of the establishment Republicans
[3:18:03.200 --> 3:18:08.560]  in this administration but I think he is being held responsible for the policy
[3:18:08.560 --> 3:18:15.400]  failures of health care blame that he should share with rights previous and I
[3:18:15.400 --> 3:18:23.080]  can report that Ivanka Trump really has been the lead in urging his replacement
[3:18:23.080 --> 3:18:29.840]  I don't think the outlook is good for Steve but my sources also tell me that
[3:18:29.840 --> 3:18:36.400]  he did not stand up against the the strike that he was neutral on the
[3:18:36.400 --> 3:18:43.360]  question of the strike against Syria as the leading non-interventionist voice in
[3:18:43.360 --> 3:18:50.120]  this administration that would of course be disappointing I do think that there
[3:18:50.120 --> 3:18:56.360]  is a dynamic for change within the White House staff despite the official
[3:18:56.360 --> 3:19:02.360]  denials in this case I'm going to stand up for Sean Spicer of whom I've been
[3:19:02.360 --> 3:19:07.040]  most critical because I think he merely made an honest mistake he should now
[3:19:07.040 --> 3:19:11.960]  come back and say that his reading of history was incorrect regarding the
[3:19:11.960 --> 3:19:17.680]  Third Reich's use of chemicals on their own people or on any peoples it is
[3:19:17.680 --> 3:19:24.080]  horrific regardless and move on he is being unfairly targeted and ostracized
[3:19:24.080 --> 3:19:34.080]  because he's the spokesman for president Donald J. Trump we are we are also I
[3:19:34.080 --> 3:19:41.640]  think interested to see that Donald Trump's moves in Syria the limited and
[3:19:41.640 --> 3:19:46.760]  very surgical airstrike which I think turns out to be in the end more
[3:19:46.760 --> 3:19:53.560]  symbolic than determinative in terms of what happens on the ground in Syria there
[3:19:53.560 --> 3:19:58.080]  are indications that despite the very best efforts of generals Mattis and
[3:19:58.080 --> 3:20:05.160]  McMaster to push President Trump into being George W. Bush and expanding the
[3:20:05.160 --> 3:20:12.120]  war in Syria with 150,000 ground troops Trump to his credit whose instincts are
[3:20:12.120 --> 3:20:19.160]  always good is resisting that narrative and falling back to his campaign
[3:20:19.160 --> 3:20:26.120]  position of not seeking you know foreign wars based on the need for regime
[3:20:26.120 --> 3:20:31.400]  change the positives of the Trump initiative in Syria I think are pretty
[3:20:31.400 --> 3:20:38.400]  clear China is now openly urging the North Koreans to behave and saying that
[3:20:38.400 --> 3:20:45.640]  if they don't the Chinese may nuke their nuclear plant the or I should say bomb
[3:20:45.640 --> 3:20:51.120]  their nuclear plant the Russians giving indications that they might be willing
[3:20:51.120 --> 3:20:57.520]  to reconsider their support for Assad as long as we are committed to the
[3:20:57.520 --> 3:21:03.040]  destruction of ISIS and Islamic terrorism in the country these are all
[3:21:03.040 --> 3:21:08.120]  manifestations of the of the diplomatic move or I should say the geo
[3:21:08.120 --> 3:21:17.360]  political move of the assault on the air base in Syria at the same time I don't
[3:21:17.360 --> 3:21:23.600]  think that you have a circle of advisors around the president reminding him of his
[3:21:23.600 --> 3:21:29.040]  campaign pledges and making the case for non-interventionism but the case is
[3:21:29.040 --> 3:21:36.320]  being made by many rank-and-file Trump supporters who are bombarding social
[3:21:36.320 --> 3:21:44.560]  media and the White House with negative reaction to the limited incursion into
[3:21:44.560 --> 3:21:51.400]  Syria and letting the president know that they remember his pledge not to go
[3:21:51.400 --> 3:22:01.240]  off to future foreign wars that is having an effect not in the sense that
[3:22:01.240 --> 3:22:10.400]  his advisors are affecting him McMaster Mahis certainly the first son-in-law but
[3:22:10.400 --> 3:22:18.840]  Trump is I think reinforced in a corrective view that we should not expand
[3:22:18.840 --> 3:22:25.280]  our engagement into Syria and as I told Politico yesterday in my opinion doing
[3:22:25.280 --> 3:22:31.640]  so would be the functional end of Trumpism president seems to be going the
[3:22:31.640 --> 3:22:37.120]  right direction here I think he has a diplomatic success on his hands remains
[3:22:37.120 --> 3:22:42.360]  to be seen whether it is a military success whether it in fact affects the
[3:22:42.360 --> 3:22:48.600]  bottom line of what happens in Syria but he seems to be making a number of
[3:22:48.600 --> 3:22:57.960]  signals that he is moving against a wider war then there is the news by the
[3:22:57.960 --> 3:23:06.360]  Washington Post that Carter Page who appended himself to some issue advisory
[3:23:06.360 --> 3:23:13.640]  committee for the Trump campaign was indeed under a surveilled under a FISA
[3:23:13.640 --> 3:23:22.800]  warrant based on what probable cause we do not know Mr. Page denies any wrong
[3:23:22.800 --> 3:23:30.360]  doing but clearly unlike myself or others he has visited Russia he had had
[3:23:30.360 --> 3:23:37.720]  communications with some Russians I continue to favor a full and vigorous
[3:23:37.720 --> 3:23:45.840]  investigation here but the investigation needs to include whether the actions of
[3:23:45.840 --> 3:23:55.240]  Susan Rice to unmask the various Trump associates utilizing intelligence
[3:23:55.240 --> 3:24:02.720]  community data from surveillance for political purposes how high did that go
[3:24:02.720 --> 3:24:10.080]  did that go to Valerie Jarrett the alter ego of President Obama did it go to the
[3:24:10.080 --> 3:24:16.200]  president himself if no person is above the law while I would like to see the
[3:24:16.200 --> 3:24:20.480]  House and Senate Intelligence Committee delve into these issues the real place
[3:24:20.480 --> 3:24:25.960]  they should be adjudicated is before a grand jury I would point out the
[3:24:25.960 --> 3:24:31.520]  criminalization of Watergate and the fact that although the Senate hearings
[3:24:31.520 --> 3:24:36.760]  into Watergate were riveting television and the House impeachment proceedings
[3:24:36.760 --> 3:24:43.120]  against Nixon were riveting television and in the end it was the Watergate
[3:24:43.120 --> 3:24:48.360]  special prosecutor who sent the circle the closest circle of aides around
[3:24:48.360 --> 3:24:55.080]  President Reagan of President Nixon to prison once again no person is above the
[3:24:55.080 --> 3:25:01.040]  law the real vulnerability here as it becomes clear that there is no Russian
[3:25:01.040 --> 3:25:08.960]  collusion is that the Russian collusion claim invented by John Podesta as a
[3:25:08.960 --> 3:25:14.600]  diversion from Podesta's own business activities making millions of dollars
[3:25:14.600 --> 3:25:22.240]  with the clique around Putin of oligarchs the gas deal the uranium deal the bank
[3:25:22.240 --> 3:25:31.360]  deal and so on is a is a manufactured of whole cloth and this rationalization
[3:25:31.360 --> 3:25:40.240]  this legal justification for the monitoring of we know for certain now
[3:25:40.240 --> 3:25:46.440]  a Mr. Page is not based in any probable cause or evidence but based in a
[3:25:46.440 --> 3:25:54.600]  political motive that makes what Susan Rice did worse than Watergate Watergate
[3:25:54.600 --> 3:26:02.880]  times 10 this could bring down the entire front line of the Obama administration
[3:26:02.880 --> 3:26:08.400]  and I believe and I have said this previously and we're going to find out
[3:26:08.400 --> 3:26:13.880]  shortly that I was most likely under surveillance either under the same
[3:26:13.880 --> 3:26:20.120]  warrant or under an additional identical warrant I say that because of
[3:26:20.120 --> 3:26:25.240]  information in the New York Times on January 20th the day of the inaugural
[3:26:25.240 --> 3:26:33.040]  the headline is a wiretapped data utilized in probe of Trump associates I
[3:26:33.040 --> 3:26:40.600]  am named in that story with Carter Page and Paul Manafort if that is true then
[3:26:40.600 --> 3:26:52.920]  then the FISA court the super secret FISA court is is has conducted this
[3:26:52.920 --> 3:27:00.760]  surveillance for political motives that Rice and others use the fruit of that
[3:27:00.760 --> 3:27:10.120]  surveillance for political purposes and most importantly my civil rights my
[3:27:10.120 --> 3:27:16.000]  civil liberties were violated on the basis of no probable cause on the basis
[3:27:16.000 --> 3:27:21.920]  of no real tangible evidence on the basis of a outrageous claim by John
[3:27:21.920 --> 3:27:30.720]  Podesta I am huddling with my lawyers to see what my options are with the caveat
[3:27:30.720 --> 3:27:36.840]  that I hear deafening silence from the House and Senate Intelligence Committees
[3:27:36.840 --> 3:27:43.320]  John McCain has defamed me has said things that are patently not true has
[3:27:43.320 --> 3:27:49.000]  claimed that I have a relationship with former Ukrainian president Yanukovych who
[3:27:49.000 --> 3:27:53.880]  I have no relationship with whatsoever I've never worked for him I've never
[3:27:53.880 --> 3:27:58.680]  met him I don't know him I have no association with him he's also said
[3:27:58.680 --> 3:28:05.040]  that I have association with the Russians that's also false on the house side
[3:28:05.040 --> 3:28:11.600]  congressman Adam Schiff a politician on the make a guy who may think he's going
[3:28:11.600 --> 3:28:19.360]  to move to Diane Feinstein's US Senate seat over my dead body is incorrect he
[3:28:19.360 --> 3:28:23.760]  has made a number of flat statements about me that are false that are
[3:28:23.760 --> 3:28:29.640]  demonstrably false and I await my time in front of either committee but what I
[3:28:29.640 --> 3:28:37.280]  hear is deafening silence from both now it's not because the president's action
[3:28:37.280 --> 3:28:42.720]  in Syria has knocked the wind out of the Russian narrative the mainstream
[3:28:42.720 --> 3:28:47.920]  media continues to try to whip this the fact that the Carter Page story in
[3:28:47.920 --> 3:28:54.000]  today's Washington Post is a page one story proves of the point so Washington
[3:28:54.000 --> 3:29:00.880]  is boiling now with intrigue the House Democrats are flummoxed by the fact
[3:29:00.880 --> 3:29:05.520]  that Devin Nunes selflessly stepped aside even though he's done nothing wrong
[3:29:05.520 --> 3:29:12.400]  and will now leave the prosecution of this investigation to Trey Gowdy and
[3:29:12.400 --> 3:29:17.720]  congressman Tom Rooney from my home state of Florida both good men both
[3:29:17.720 --> 3:29:24.120]  former prosecutors both attorneys and they will insist on an investigation
[3:29:24.120 --> 3:29:30.040]  that is broader than just the question of Russian collusion that will extend to
[3:29:30.040 --> 3:29:35.240]  the improprieties with surveillance information by the Obama administration
[3:29:35.240 --> 3:29:49.840]  thanks for joining me at info wars and we'll be right back we're on the March
[3:29:49.840 --> 3:29:57.520]  the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[3:29:57.520 --> 3:30:05.800]  Russian president Vladimir Putin says the Syria chemical attack was a false
[3:30:05.800 --> 3:30:12.720]  flag and more are on the way we have information from various sources that a
[3:30:12.720 --> 3:30:16.960]  similar provocation and I can't call it anything other than a provocation is
[3:30:16.960 --> 3:30:21.240]  being prepared in other parts of Syria including the southern suburbs of
[3:30:21.240 --> 3:30:25.760]  Damascus where they're again preparing to release some similar chemical
[3:30:25.760 --> 3:30:30.280]  substances and accuse the Syrian authorities of using them Putin went
[3:30:30.280 --> 3:30:35.920]  on to compare the situation in Syria to Saddam Hussein's non-existence weapons
[3:30:35.920 --> 3:30:40.760]  of mass destruction which may indicate that he believes the US is either
[3:30:40.760 --> 3:30:45.960]  behind the false flag or actively pushing the propaganda meanwhile the
[3:30:45.960 --> 3:30:50.880]  Russian government says Syrian forces possess no chemical weapons and any
[3:30:50.880 --> 3:30:56.600]  further attacks in Syria by the United States will be unacceptable and you can

[3:35:37.240 --> 3:35:46.420]  assault on our first amendment rights the active gambit of the tech left to
[3:35:46.420 --> 3:35:54.160]  engage in Stalin-like censorship you see they can't argue with the fact that
[3:35:54.160 --> 3:35:59.280]  their policies whether they be their fiscal policies of borrowing and
[3:35:59.280 --> 3:36:05.800]  spending their adventurous foreign policies their porous border immigration
[3:36:05.800 --> 3:36:13.280]  policies their one-sided rigged trade policies their policies have brought the
[3:36:13.280 --> 3:36:20.640]  country to its knees rather than engage in a vigorous debate with us they want
[3:36:20.640 --> 3:36:30.560]  to shut us up about their failures and many Americans and many journalists look
[3:36:30.560 --> 3:36:36.840]  at me like i'm some kind of a conspiracy theorist when i talk about the fact
[3:36:36.840 --> 3:36:45.200]  that in christmas of 2017 buried deep in the 2017 national defense authorization
[3:36:45.200 --> 3:36:51.120]  act and never mentioned by the president in his official statement after
[3:36:51.120 --> 3:36:56.800]  signing it was the counter disinformation and anti-propaganda act of
[3:36:56.800 --> 3:37:05.400]  2017 this essentially makes free speech on the internet it criminalizes
[3:37:05.400 --> 3:37:13.320]  certain free speech that is deemed to be quote-unquote fake news there you have
[3:37:13.320 --> 3:37:22.280]  it folks the this sets up essentially the ministry of truth the the the the
[3:37:22.280 --> 3:37:27.400]  national board of censorship if you will the new law will allow the government
[3:37:27.400 --> 3:37:33.000]  to crack down with impunity against any media outlet that it deems to be
[3:37:33.000 --> 3:37:39.720]  propaganda this piece of legislation provides huge amounts of money to fund
[3:37:39.720 --> 3:37:45.760]  counter propaganda to make sure the government's approved stories drown out
[3:37:45.760 --> 3:37:52.680]  alternative news or any journalists like those here at info wars who challenge
[3:37:52.680 --> 3:38:01.240]  the US government narrative of events this would be an entirely legal crack
[3:38:01.240 --> 3:38:07.960]  down it's also been called the countering information warfare act of 2016
[3:38:07.960 --> 3:38:16.000]  and ironically this particular piece of censorship was sponsored by senator rob
[3:38:16.000 --> 3:38:24.520]  portman of Ohio a longtime retainer for the bush family and a certified member
[3:38:24.520 --> 3:38:33.720]  of the two-party ruling duopoly in Washington DC how is this manifesting
[3:38:33.720 --> 3:38:39.000]  itself well we've reported extensively here at info wars dot com about the
[3:38:39.000 --> 3:38:49.200]  active treachery of Google and Facebook a story from email marketing in March of
[3:38:49.200 --> 3:39:01.080]  2017 notes incredibly that Google when putting forward press releases from
[3:39:01.080 --> 3:39:08.520]  Hillary Clinton's campaign classified those updates those as updates whereas
[3:39:08.520 --> 3:39:17.000]  Donald Trump's were classified as promotions this this interpretation
[3:39:17.000 --> 3:39:23.440]  alone guaranteed that Hillary Clinton's press releases would get millions of
[3:39:23.440 --> 3:39:29.920]  more opens than Donald Trump's it's a perfect example of the subtle techniques
[3:39:29.920 --> 3:39:37.040]  that the folks at Google were using in their efforts to limit the reach of
[3:39:37.040 --> 3:39:42.040]  Donald Trump during the campaign and typical of the kind of efforts that are
[3:39:42.040 --> 3:39:49.680]  being used to block info wars dot com or stone cold truth dot com or the stone
[3:39:49.680 --> 3:39:55.280]  zone or I should just say stone zone dot com or daily caller or Breitbart or so
[3:39:55.280 --> 3:40:04.240]  many other fine sites Paul Joseph Watson yesterday posted the proof a claim a
[3:40:04.240 --> 3:40:10.720]  story that said correctly that Hillary Clinton essentially sold 20% of the
[3:40:10.720 --> 3:40:16.320]  uranium production in the United States to a company that is controlled by
[3:40:16.320 --> 3:40:21.840]  Vladimir Putin and the Kremlin but snopes com it is noted in the lower left
[3:40:21.840 --> 3:40:29.320]  corner deems this story to be fake news well I deem snopes to be fake news and
[3:40:29.320 --> 3:40:35.240]  the idea that some third party is going to decide what we can read and what we
[3:40:35.240 --> 3:40:40.480]  cannot read or what we should believe and not believe it's entirely
[3:40:40.480 --> 3:40:47.800]  antithetical to the First Amendment of the US Constitution that's what we're
[3:40:47.800 --> 3:40:57.280]  up against now the slipping of brother Steve Bannon which sadly I think is
[3:40:57.280 --> 3:41:04.760]  exacerbated by the fact that mr. Bannon would not utilize his political capital
[3:41:04.760 --> 3:41:12.400]  to bring other non-globalists into the White House staff to bring other
[3:41:12.400 --> 3:41:19.000]  nationalists those who share the Trump vision into the White House staff now
[3:41:19.000 --> 3:41:26.760]  sadly surrounded by his establishment enemies Steve Bannon's alone this makes
[3:41:26.760 --> 3:41:34.480]  the question of his long-term survival or his even his future effectiveness
[3:41:34.480 --> 3:41:44.360]  unclear this development is particularly concerning in view of the the the onslaught
[3:41:44.360 --> 3:41:50.320]  through the internet media to slowly strangle us through censorship because
[3:41:50.320 --> 3:41:54.720]  if there is anyone in the president's entourage who should understand this
[3:41:54.720 --> 3:42:00.600]  issue and who can educate the president about this issue it would be Steve
[3:42:00.600 --> 3:42:08.240]  Bannon he comes after all from alternative media I have always valued
[3:42:08.240 --> 3:42:15.360]  my my contributions to Breitbart for whom I write on occasion my many occasions
[3:42:15.360 --> 3:42:23.080]  on the Breitbart radio program on serious but it is therefore problematic
[3:42:23.080 --> 3:42:30.320]  that while mr. Bannon may be on the skids the folks at Facebook the folks at
[3:42:30.320 --> 3:42:38.160]  Google are whining and dining the first son-in-law Jared Kushner and his wife
[3:42:38.160 --> 3:42:47.520]  Ivanka about whom I cannot say enough good things as I reported earlier Ivanka
[3:42:47.520 --> 3:42:55.640]  has rather taken the lead in the in the effort to purge Steve Bannon and when
[3:42:55.640 --> 3:43:00.680]  the president says to Michael Goodwin in the New York Post that he barely knows
[3:43:00.680 --> 3:43:09.680]  Bannon it's a very bad sign so we have Bannon in eclipse we have the people who
[3:43:09.680 --> 3:43:15.840]  are trying to kneecap info wars dot com and kneecap the stone cold truth dot
[3:43:15.840 --> 3:43:23.000]  com and kneecap stone zone dot com and daily caller and Breitbart town hall and
[3:43:23.000 --> 3:43:32.560]  so many other fine conservative liberty oriented websites this is problematic
[3:43:32.560 --> 3:43:42.400]  if the censors have their way the prospect for the reelection of Donald
[3:43:42.400 --> 3:43:48.160]  Trump without a vibrant and robust alternative media readily available on
[3:43:48.160 --> 3:43:55.960]  the internet well those prospects are zero this is survival folks and this is
[3:43:55.960 --> 3:44:01.320]  why again we need your support at the info wars com store whether it's the
[3:44:01.320 --> 3:44:07.320]  caveman formula or whether it's your Hillary Clinton pardon me Hillary
[3:44:07.320 --> 3:44:13.640]  Clinton for prison t-shirts which were very much in evidence the Hillary
[3:44:13.640 --> 3:44:19.280]  Clinton for prison 2017 t-shirts very much in evidence the other night in
[3:44:19.280 --> 3:44:25.000]  Pembroke Pines when I spoke to two back-to-back Trump rallies this is a
[3:44:25.000 --> 3:44:31.680]  very popular item it sticks it right in the thumb of the eye it takes your thumb
[3:44:31.680 --> 3:44:36.480]  and sticks it in the eye of the political establishment and the Hillary
[3:44:36.480 --> 3:44:45.600]  apologists and it supports the movement so I send you there for for your t-shirt
[3:44:45.600 --> 3:44:53.440]  make a statement and support us we're we're going to see I think an upheaval
[3:44:53.440 --> 3:44:58.640]  in the Trump administration I tweeted last week that change is going to come
[3:44:58.640 --> 3:45:05.400]  and I think it will at the end I put my faith in the instincts of Donald J
[3:45:05.400 --> 3:45:11.000]  Trump I honestly believe that when he gets all the information he almost
[3:45:11.000 --> 3:45:17.800]  invariably makes the right decision what I fear is that he is not getting the
[3:45:17.800 --> 3:45:25.000]  the whole truth the full truth the necessary facts and we know that some
[3:45:25.000 --> 3:45:33.080]  around him McMaster Mattis and others have advocated a broad war for example I
[3:45:33.080 --> 3:45:38.800]  don't know that he is aware of the enormous challenge posed by the
[3:45:38.800 --> 3:45:45.800]  censorship brigade which is legally authorized by Barack Obama and their
[3:45:45.800 --> 3:45:53.320]  cooperation with the barons of Silicon Valley to strangle the Trump perform
[3:45:53.320 --> 3:46:01.760]  movement in the cradle and without Steve Bannon at his sleeve to tell him we
[3:46:01.760 --> 3:46:10.760]  have to count on you yes you the individual activist who watches info
[3:46:10.760 --> 3:46:17.680]  wars or tunes into any other fine conservative alternative media you need
[3:46:17.680 --> 3:46:25.800]  to contact the lighthouse you need to post your feelings on social media you
[3:46:25.800 --> 3:46:32.720]  need to stand up for Trump ism and in that way I think the president will get
[3:46:32.720 --> 3:46:38.640]  the signal that's why I think he's moving away from the wider war there are
[3:46:38.640 --> 3:46:46.360]  number of indications in his public comments that the incurred Syria was
[3:46:46.360 --> 3:46:51.720]  meant to be limited in his mind was limited was a very effective in several
[3:46:51.720 --> 3:46:58.840]  respects but it does not signal the abandonment of Trump ism and a new
[3:46:58.840 --> 3:47:07.200]  interventionist jag if it does well then we will have failed what do I mean by
[3:47:07.200 --> 3:47:14.040]  that well the president's coalition the coalition of right of center voters
[3:47:14.040 --> 3:47:20.320]  that elected him has many stripes some in our coalition our social
[3:47:20.320 --> 3:47:26.000]  conservatives they're motivated by issues like abortion and transgendered
[3:47:26.000 --> 3:47:32.240]  bathrooms and states rights others in our movement are libertarians they're
[3:47:32.240 --> 3:47:38.920]  fed up with with interventionism abroad and foreign war that does not involve
[3:47:38.920 --> 3:47:44.720]  our national interests there also they tend to be against big government
[3:47:44.720 --> 3:47:51.200]  against the government criminalization of marijuana and Donald Trump with his
[3:47:51.200 --> 3:47:56.280]  position on medical marijuana and states rights appealed to these voters as did
[3:47:56.280 --> 3:48:02.920]  his anti-war position and then there are the traditional conservative
[3:48:02.920 --> 3:48:08.760]  Republicans of the Reagan stripe in our coalition the one thing that isn't in our
[3:48:08.760 --> 3:48:16.440]  coalition are neocons now we cannot afford to lose any of the elements of
[3:48:16.440 --> 3:48:21.680]  the Trump coalition because the president has to govern and he can only
[3:48:21.680 --> 3:48:29.000]  govern with a majority coalition no matter how slender and if that coalition
[3:48:29.000 --> 3:48:37.080]  splinters over war it could be the functional end of Trump ism look at the
[3:48:37.080 --> 3:48:43.880]  economic indicators look at the recent Supreme Court justice who was
[3:48:43.880 --> 3:48:50.400]  confirmed relatively easily look at the incredible work the president is doing
[3:48:50.400 --> 3:48:58.320]  at the regulatory and departmental level which doesn't get the media coverage
[3:48:58.320 --> 3:49:04.080]  it should and you will see that as Alex Jones says when it comes to domestic
[3:49:04.080 --> 3:49:13.960]  policy the president's an A a BS at worst and if the incursion into Syria does
[3:49:13.960 --> 3:49:21.160]  turn out to be a limited one-time military operation and doesn't herald a
[3:49:21.160 --> 3:49:26.960]  wider war well then Trump ism despite many who work for him in the White
[3:49:26.960 --> 3:49:32.880]  House is very much intact let me say at the close here if you want to
[3:49:32.880 --> 3:49:38.160]  understand the backstory on so much of this I still urge you to go to the
[3:49:38.160 --> 3:49:43.800]  m4s.com store and get your copy of the making of the president 2016 by that
[3:49:43.800 --> 3:49:50.240]  brilliant New York Times best-selling author Roger Stone this is an insider's
[3:49:50.240 --> 3:49:58.440]  take on how Alex Jones and others other MVPs like James O'Keefe played a crucial
[3:49:58.440 --> 3:50:04.680]  role in providing an alternative narrative for the American people then
[3:50:04.680 --> 3:50:10.480]  the narrative put forward by the mainstream media and CNN and the other
[3:50:10.480 --> 3:50:18.160]  mainstream pundits who in their elitism and in their arrogance could not see
[3:50:18.160 --> 3:50:23.840]  that the American people were fed up with globalism they were fed up with the
[3:50:23.840 --> 3:50:30.240]  loss of American sovereignty they were fed up with those who reject American
[3:50:30.240 --> 3:50:38.400]  exceptionalism that they want a muscular national defense as a deterrent to bad
[3:50:38.400 --> 3:50:46.960]  actors like the North Korean dictator but that they rejected adventurism
[3:50:46.960 --> 3:50:53.280]  around the globe it's a definitive look on how Donald Trump pulled off the
[3:50:53.280 --> 3:50:58.600]  greatest upset in American history and you can still grab it at the info wars
[3:50:58.600 --> 3:51:03.760]  dot com store now all right so I've just gotten word that we're going to keep

[3:52:38.880 --> 3:52:46.640]  market long before I ever met Alex Jones long before I became an aficionado and a
[3:52:46.640 --> 3:52:53.000]  member of the family here at info wars I had been a believer in holistic medicine
[3:52:53.000 --> 3:52:58.000]  and the use of natural herbs and settlements to supplement and in fact
[3:52:58.000 --> 3:53:06.720]  have a prophylactic effect on health and I can tell you there are sadly a lot of
[3:53:06.720 --> 3:53:11.400]  bogus purveyors out there who are selling you products that are mostly filler
[3:53:11.400 --> 3:53:17.480]  or that are of inferior or diluted quality you will never find that at
[3:53:17.480 --> 3:53:24.160]  info wars dot com at the store every one of these products has to go through the
[3:53:24.160 --> 3:53:29.200]  rigorous testing and the personal approval of Alex Jones himself and he
[3:53:29.200 --> 3:53:33.640]  sells nothing in which he does not believe and that belief is based on
[3:53:33.640 --> 3:53:38.560]  hundreds and hundreds in some cases thousands of individual testimonials
[3:53:38.560 --> 3:53:43.080]  people who have tried and tested the product and come back and said this
[3:53:43.080 --> 3:53:49.680]  really works this is a great product so no matter what you choose you can do so
[3:53:49.680 --> 3:53:57.720]  with confidence that every one of these products is the best available that when
[3:53:57.720 --> 3:54:03.560]  you buy iodine for example the iodine supplement you are getting the best
[3:54:03.560 --> 3:54:10.160]  iodine the most efficient or effective iodine available on the market a lot of
[3:54:10.160 --> 3:54:18.560]  these herbs and and key natural elements are not that easy to find in high
[3:54:18.560 --> 3:54:26.240]  quality quantities but info wars manages to do that every once in a while I get
[3:54:26.240 --> 3:54:30.520]  upset when they're out of a product but frankly I think people who are into
[3:54:30.520 --> 3:54:35.920]  alternative supplements understand that the quality is here and therefore some
[3:54:35.920 --> 3:54:43.480]  of the best products sell out very quickly the superfluoride toothpaste which
[3:54:43.480 --> 3:54:48.840]  is now available not only in the peppermint flavor but a new bubblegum
[3:54:48.840 --> 3:54:54.360]  flavor which is great for kids my grandchildren love the bubblegum they
[3:54:54.360 --> 3:54:59.360]  thought that the peppermint was a little spicy a little harsh my wife on the
[3:54:59.360 --> 3:55:03.760]  other hand likes the peppermint and that is the whitest most gleaming smile
[3:55:03.760 --> 3:55:09.200]  you're ever going to see so this is a perfect example of the high quality
[3:55:09.200 --> 3:55:15.640]  product you can only get here at info wars and not only are you going to have
[3:55:15.640 --> 3:55:21.080]  better oral health and frankly the health of the gums has been tied directly

[3:55:25.820 --> 3:55:29.520]  fight for freedom you're going to be giving us the war chest we need to take
[3:55:29.520 --> 3:55:35.760]  on the globalists to take on the the folks at Google to take on the the
[3:55:35.760 --> 3:55:42.320]  sensors who would seek to silence those of us who stood shoulder to shoulder for
[3:55:42.320 --> 3:55:49.240]  Donald J. Trump so it's a it's a win-win situation folks you can help back the
[3:55:49.240 --> 3:55:55.400]  revolution and you can get superior products please hit the info wars.com

[3:56:02.040 --> 3:56:08.520]  for liberty will go on I noticed that I got a lot of mail today pointing out to
[3:56:08.520 --> 3:56:15.120]  me that Michelle and Barack Obama our esteemed former president and the future
[3:56:15.120 --> 3:56:20.480]  nominee of the Democratic Party for president in 2020 marked my words Michelle
[3:56:20.480 --> 3:56:26.560]  Obama are in Tahiti a country that has no current extradition treaty with the
[3:56:26.560 --> 3:56:30.680]  United States now the president is slated to return to the United States on
[3:56:30.680 --> 3:56:36.440]  Monday but that appears it has now been postponed with the arrival of the former
[3:56:36.440 --> 3:56:42.720]  first lady on Saturday the president's been staying for at least a month 30
[3:56:42.720 --> 3:56:49.040]  miles from Tahiti in a private island resort called the Brando which can only
[3:56:49.040 --> 3:56:58.280]  be reached by boat or small seaplane now he is a he may have left us resort to go
[3:56:58.280 --> 3:57:05.120]  to French Polynesian Islands but the question is is this Elba is the president
[3:57:05.120 --> 3:57:10.520]  out of the country and unavailable because perhaps just perhaps he sees
[3:57:10.520 --> 3:57:18.280]  Susan Rice and Valerie Jarrett headed to the grand jury and he sees the collapse
[3:57:18.280 --> 3:57:23.280]  of the phony Russian argument and the spying on Donald Trump about to hit the
[3:57:23.280 --> 3:57:29.440]  fan yes you heard it here first at info wars.com all right so we're going to
[3:57:29.440 --> 3:57:39.920]  continue the the terrific reporting of Jerry Corsi last week regarding the the
[3:57:39.920 --> 3:57:46.040]  Soros funded fight for the future is yet another manifestation of the Google
[3:57:46.040 --> 3:57:52.520]  effort to choke us I've seen this myself at stone cold truce.com and the fact
[3:57:52.520 --> 3:57:58.040]  that we are in our retweets while we were surging before the election and
[3:57:58.040 --> 3:58:02.400]  after the election now suddenly were mysteriously down yes it's an all-out
[3:58:02.400 --> 3:58:06.800]  assault on our first amendment and we're going to talk about how to fight it
[3:58:06.800 --> 3:58:29.360]  coming up at info wars many thanks
