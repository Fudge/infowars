[00:00.000 --> 00:24.480]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex
[00:24.480 --> 00:46.680]  Jones. It's Sunday, March 24, 2019, under host Alex Jones. Well, we always knew there
[00:46.680 --> 00:51.320]  wasn't any Russian collusion by President Trump or myself. That was the main thing they
[00:51.320 --> 00:56.000]  cited in Congress to have me. The platform was a Russian agent. It never called me to
[00:56.000 --> 01:02.520]  beat me. Interrogated, never brought me before Congress, but with the face of my accusers.
[01:02.520 --> 01:07.760]  But they said it nonetheless. They're not one American charged with actual collusion
[01:07.760 --> 01:17.480]  with a Rusky. Meanwhile, we have the Democratic Party literally on the Chai-Com payroll. But
[01:17.480 --> 01:22.080]  what's coming next? A lot of Republicans and a lot of conservatives, a lot of nationalists
[01:22.080 --> 01:27.640]  are celebrating right now. And if you thought it was dangerous to be on the streets of your
[01:27.640 --> 01:32.640]  recognizable Trump supporter when Trump won, or in the last two and a half years, let me
[01:32.640 --> 01:40.640]  tell you something. Since this news came out Friday, if I go to the grocery store, if I
[01:40.640 --> 01:46.600]  go to a restaurant, if I go to a comedy club, 95% of people that recognize me, and that's
[01:46.600 --> 01:52.680]  like half the people shake my hand. But every four or five minutes of I'm in public around
[01:52.680 --> 01:59.640]  a crowd, somebody starts trying to physically attack me. I mean, they are crazy people.
[01:59.640 --> 02:09.080]  Their whole identity is in that they are the chosen ones and that they are the intellectuals
[02:09.080 --> 02:14.600]  because they're all unemployed or school teachers or professors who dress up as anti-slaught
[02:14.600 --> 02:19.880]  here in the weekends. And they listen to NPR and believe, even though statistically they
[02:19.880 --> 02:29.200]  have lower IQs and are paid less, that they are the anointed ones. And it's just not going
[02:29.200 --> 02:34.080]  the way it was planned. So it's crazy. And I want to open the phones up today to get
[02:34.080 --> 02:41.240]  your take on this. But as I told you over and over again, they use the Russiagate phony
[02:41.240 --> 02:50.680]  investigation, the Inquisition, the witch hunt, the real red scare, to not just cover up
[02:50.680 --> 02:54.920]  the illegal spying on Trump during the campaign and once he was president-elect, but to cover
[02:54.920 --> 02:58.520]  up the criminal activity of the Clintons and others with the Russians, because who would
[02:58.520 --> 03:03.440]  think people investigating Russia would be actually in bed with Russia, and then it
[03:03.440 --> 03:09.680]  was used as a dragnet to try to find dirt on Trump and his associates. But Trump is
[03:09.680 --> 03:15.440]  so clean compared to other, quote, politicians and people that despite the fact they busted
[03:15.440 --> 03:20.720]  a few of his lawyers who had their own scams going on the side, in two-plus years they
[03:20.720 --> 03:27.880]  haven't been able to find anybody other than Michael Cohen who will make up stuff. And
[03:27.880 --> 03:33.880]  so, yes, Mueller in its third phase, special counsel was meant to find the dirt to hand
[03:33.880 --> 03:37.800]  off to Congress and to hand off to U.S. attorneys. And there will be more investigations, but
[03:37.800 --> 03:44.520]  they're going nowhere. And it's what happens when the tyranny of an entrenched bureaucracy
[03:44.520 --> 03:53.720]  and political classes who had all their power handed to them runs into a sharp, aggressive,
[03:53.720 --> 03:59.840]  intelligent person like Trump. And then Trump's able to rally the people to take action and
[03:59.840 --> 04:03.520]  the left thought intimidation and all the rest of us will make us go away. It only made
[04:03.520 --> 04:10.880]  us entrenched. That said, though, just from what I've seen on the street, they are foaming
[04:10.880 --> 04:15.720]  at the mouth of the stage, Jesse Smollett stuff. I was in a restaurant and people come
[04:15.720 --> 04:19.080]  in and threaten me three times. When I left the restaurant, they were waiting outside.
[04:19.080 --> 04:25.480]  Then when I got in their face, they go, we're victims, we're victims, we're victims. And
[04:25.480 --> 04:28.640]  the leftist media grabbed it and posted it at the top. But it's like Jesse Smollett.
[04:28.640 --> 04:35.720]  We got the raw footage. It's going to work. You were supposed to just roll over and die.
[04:35.720 --> 04:40.320]  We're supposed to just go away, but we didn't. We're still there. And we're still winning
[04:40.320 --> 04:43.600]  thanks to you, the listeners. So that's just some of what we've got. We've got some of
[04:43.600 --> 04:47.080]  the epic former predictions of the Democrats. Now we've got their epic meltdowns. Then your
[04:47.080 --> 04:51.280]  phone calls. But then the rest of the story. Yeah, a lot of good stuff's happening, but
[04:51.280 --> 04:54.960]  the globalists have got some tricks up their sleeves. We better look at those. Plus some
[04:54.960 --> 05:01.080]  other really good news. Oh my gosh. We'll be back in 60 seconds.
[05:01.080 --> 05:06.720]  And now through the end of March, we are running the biggest special of this year. So far it

[06:00.000 --> 06:14.080]  crashing through the lies and disinformation. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the
[06:14.080 --> 06:38.920]  front lines of the info war. Well, I think instead of making comments myself, it's just
[06:38.920 --> 06:44.640]  best to play a short compilation in a moment of the controlled corporate fascist media
[06:44.640 --> 06:49.400]  posing as leftist posing as liberals. Just the walls are closing in. There's no doubt
[06:49.400 --> 06:57.920]  he's a Russian absolute proof. Russia's stole the election. Total fiction. Russia on a scale
[06:57.920 --> 07:03.600]  of one to 10 for infiltrating the US politically is about a one. The Chinese are about a 20.
[07:03.600 --> 07:09.560]  You're like, I thought it was a scale of one to 10. Yeah. The Russians were doing that
[07:09.560 --> 07:16.560]  to be all over them. They're not. What they are doing is injecting a bunch of trips into
[07:16.560 --> 07:24.120]  Venezuela, which is our hemisphere is dangerous and it's wrong. Militarily, Russia's militarily
[07:24.120 --> 07:29.680]  a threat and about 10. But see, we're not worried about that. We're worried about just
[07:29.680 --> 07:42.120]  dominating politically. But now the attorney general, Bob Barr has sent over the report
[07:42.120 --> 07:46.880]  and he's sending it over to Congress reportedly about a Mara. They sent over summary saying
[07:46.880 --> 07:54.760]  no Russia collusion and the Democrats just don't know what to do. Ladies and gentlemen,
[07:54.760 --> 07:58.680]  there never was any collusion. We know that the Democrats tried to steal the election.
[07:58.680 --> 08:04.160]  They failed. They tried to discredit the election. And because they're globalists that are anti-American,
[08:04.160 --> 08:07.600]  that's the point that made them lose the elections. They went, wait, how do we globalists that
[08:07.600 --> 08:12.480]  want to get rid of the country and say America was never great? It'll never be great. And
[08:12.480 --> 08:16.240]  that's what all these new members of Congress have said. America sucks. It's horrible. It's
[08:16.240 --> 08:23.600]  terrible. It's embarrassing. Capitalism is irredeemable. How do they then make it look
[08:23.600 --> 08:34.520]  like they're good guys? Oh, Trump's a Russian. He wants to hurt America. No one buys that.
[08:34.520 --> 08:40.320]  And now the big drag net they had to illegally spy on everything Trump's done for years,
[08:40.320 --> 08:46.320]  that they claim was a Russia investigation, he's over. And they're farming out to different
[08:46.320 --> 08:53.560]  U.S. attorneys pieces of dirt they think they found in the next round to try to come out
[08:53.560 --> 08:58.640]  with Trump and impeaching, but the defeat of this whole thing and the fact they could
[08:58.640 --> 09:03.920]  not find one person that actually colluded in the Trump camp shows how outsider Trump
[09:03.920 --> 09:10.560]  was. Trump was not a political insider. Trump was a maverick. Trump did things his own way.
[09:10.560 --> 09:16.720]  Trump took his own counsel. All the other parties and political systems are councils
[09:16.720 --> 09:21.520]  that sit around and war game ideas and send it to insurance companies and send it to think
[09:21.520 --> 09:29.040]  tanks and then come up with the consensus of lying their own pockets and selling the
[09:29.040 --> 09:33.000]  country out. Trump comes in and is his own guy. Say what you want about it. He's definitely
[09:33.000 --> 09:41.040]  the president. He's calling the shots and that fundamentally freaks out the D.C. LA,
[09:41.040 --> 09:47.360]  New York, San Francisco, power access. They don't know what to do. They disdain the Midwest.
[09:47.360 --> 09:51.960]  They disdain Illinois. They disdain Texas. They disdain everything from Tennessee to
[09:51.960 --> 10:00.360]  Alabama out to most of Washington state to Idaho to Utah, Montana to Colorado. And so
[10:00.360 --> 10:07.360]  say what you want about Trump. I give him an A plus right now. He had about an A minus,
[10:07.360 --> 10:13.120]  which is better than Hillary's like a negative F. But when he signed the executive order
[10:13.120 --> 10:19.600]  Friday right when he knew the report was done, as our sources told us, he dropped the hammer.
[10:19.600 --> 10:23.640]  Tens of billions of college money at state colleges and federally funded colleges that
[10:23.640 --> 10:28.240]  keep running the censorship will have their money pulled. That's default. It's discriminatory.
[10:28.240 --> 10:31.440]  Federal law says that they'll try to challenge it in court. Just like everything else Trump's
[10:31.440 --> 10:37.120]  done. It'll get shot down at the night circuit. It'll win the Supremes.
[10:37.120 --> 10:43.760]  I took Trump for about a 91 to about a 96. If I was president, I'd probably be doing
[10:43.760 --> 10:48.440]  about a 55. Just because you want to get something good done doesn't mean you can get it done.
[10:48.440 --> 10:55.400]  This is phenomenal. And in this instant gratification culture, people don't appreciate what we've
[10:55.400 --> 11:02.400]  got, but I got to tell you, I still love Trump in the last couple of months. And I was sincere
[11:02.400 --> 11:07.160]  on air that I was upset. He wasn't fight the censorship, but I knew getting all of you
[11:07.160 --> 11:12.000]  active and everybody else on target along with Tucker Carlson, even Don Jr. and others
[11:12.000 --> 11:17.760]  going after his dad saying, you need to take action. This is front burner. Where did Trump's
[11:17.760 --> 11:22.320]  going to do it? And I got that word about a week ago before he did. I said, look, relax,
[11:22.320 --> 11:29.720]  Cavalry's coming. And I figured that it's just that now I've gone from my gut telling
[11:29.720 --> 11:38.080]  me Trump's totally on target to thinking, thank the Lord. But as I told you, just department
[11:38.080 --> 11:42.680]  says Mueller report does not exonerate Trump. They still may try obstruction. I love it.
[11:42.680 --> 11:49.680]  Obstruction of a crime that doesn't exist. So they're going to try a bunch of other crap,
[11:49.680 --> 11:54.360]  but this is a big blow. And it's because MSMs failed to turn people against Trump. They
[11:54.360 --> 11:58.360]  failed to kill the economy. They failed. And a lot of this power structure is pragmatically
[11:58.360 --> 12:02.840]  going. Why are we going to find a civil war with the Chinese run everything? This isn't
[12:02.840 --> 12:07.800]  even good for the elite. Why? Just just stop. But it's all about the left's hate of America.
[12:07.800 --> 12:14.400]  It's spiritual. There's part of a compilation that's up on info wars.com and news wars.com.
[12:14.400 --> 12:20.920]  Donald Trump's finished the walls are closing in. Here it is. Donald Trump's done. He's
[12:20.920 --> 12:27.360]  done. There's no question about that. He's done breaking news. The bombshell today is
[12:27.360 --> 12:32.040]  a turning point. Today was historically bad for President Trump. Today was a turning point.
[12:32.040 --> 12:36.520]  A turning point. We're at a turning point here. The beginning of the end for the Trump
[12:36.520 --> 12:41.160]  presidency. The beginning of the end. And breaking news. We have another bombshell.
[12:41.160 --> 12:45.800]  Mike Pence might have to assume the office of the presidency. The call for impeachment.
[12:45.800 --> 12:49.760]  Rumblings of the word impeachment. Breaking news. Another bombshell out of the White
[12:49.760 --> 12:53.240]  House. I believe this is the beginning of the end. Identity. It's really the beginning
[12:53.240 --> 12:57.240]  of the end. The beginning of the end. He may be feeling the walls closing in on him. All
[12:57.240 --> 13:02.520]  the walls closing in on him. The walls closing in on him. Breaking news. A new bombshell.
[13:02.520 --> 13:06.280]  One astrologer says this means the beginning of the end for President Donald Trump. The
[13:06.280 --> 13:10.560]  beginning of the end of the Trump presidency. Trump will resign. Trump is going to resign.
[13:10.560 --> 13:15.160]  Is this the tipping point? I know we've said it over and over. You think this is a tipping
[13:15.160 --> 13:20.240]  point? And over and over. This is a tipping point. And over and over. Breaking news. President
[13:20.240 --> 13:23.240]  Trump off the rails. This is the beginning of the end today. This is the beginning of
[13:23.240 --> 13:28.120]  the end. It reminds me a lot of the last days of Nixon. Breaking news. Tonight new bombshell.
[13:28.120 --> 13:32.400]  This is the beginning of the end. The beginning of the end. The walls are closing in. The
[13:32.400 --> 13:37.280]  walls closing in. The walls closing in. Breaking overnight bombshell. This is a very dramatic
[13:37.280 --> 13:40.560]  day and I think it might be near a tipping point. Do you think this is a tipping point?
[13:40.560 --> 13:45.000]  This is unbelievable. This is remarkable. Have you ever seen anything like this? His presidency
[13:45.000 --> 13:50.600]  is crippled. December 1st, 2017, you can mark it down. This is the day that everything
[13:50.600 --> 13:54.720]  changed. We begin with the bombshell. The beginning of the end. The beginning of the
[13:54.720 --> 13:58.800]  end. The beginning of the end. The beginning of the end. The beginning of the end. The
[13:58.800 --> 14:02.640]  beginning of the end. In fact, if this were a football game, we're in the third quarter.
[14:02.640 --> 14:05.840]  May even be the beginning of the end. We begin tonight with the bombshell. Donald Trump
[14:05.840 --> 14:09.520]  is in a lot of trouble. Trump is in trouble. The president will resign. Another hour, another
[14:09.520 --> 14:14.640]  bombshell. This is a tipping point. Trump's going down. This president could be impeached.
[14:14.640 --> 14:19.120]  I do not think the president will serve out his term. Resignation. Resignation. I don't
[14:19.120 --> 14:22.720]  think this president is going to serve out his term. Mr. Trump will not serve out his
[14:22.720 --> 14:28.000]  term. He will not serve out his term. No way. No how. Breaking news. Absolute bombshell.
[14:28.000 --> 14:32.920]  I think Donald Trump is in trouble. Donald Trump is not. He's done. And it's over. It's
[14:32.920 --> 14:37.560]  over. The walls closing in. The walls closing in. This is going to be the Achilles Hill.
[14:37.560 --> 14:41.800]  Breaking news tonight. I expect Trump to depart. This week will be the watershed week. Trump
[14:41.800 --> 14:45.880]  is in big trouble. Trump's in a lot of trouble. It's the side of a terrified old man who feels
[14:45.880 --> 14:50.720]  the walls closing in. The walls are increasingly closing in on him. Tonight the walls are closing
[14:50.720 --> 14:55.600]  in. Today changed everything. This is the beginning of the end. Today the biggest tipping point
[14:55.600 --> 14:59.840]  for the Trump administration. What a historic day. The bombshells they fell. It's entropy
[14:59.840 --> 15:05.400]  and it's crumbling internally. He's underwater. He feels the walls closing in. Could his testimony
[15:05.400 --> 15:08.840]  be a turning point? We may be at a tipping point. It's the beginning of the end. The
[15:08.840 --> 15:15.000]  beginning of the end. Another bombshell. Bombshell. Bombshell. Bombshell. Bombshell. Bombshell.
[15:15.000 --> 15:22.080]  This is a bombshell. It is a bombshell. I am beginning to resent the word bombshell.
[15:22.080 --> 15:26.920]  And then Twitter users said clips of Rachel Maddow and others crying when Mueller found
[15:26.920 --> 15:32.240]  no collusion with Russia and Twitter banned them. Those clips are coming up. Last night
[15:32.240 --> 15:35.080]  when I had left us come into a restaurant and yell at me and scream, they were going
[15:35.080 --> 15:39.480]  to get me. I tried to leave. They accosted me and then told security I'd come out and
[15:39.480 --> 15:43.560]  accosted them. You got to get them to the left, man. They know how to unify lie, as you just
[15:43.560 --> 15:49.520]  saw. It's a very nasty, nasty group of delusionals. The good news is humanity is waking up to
[15:49.520 --> 15:55.760]  them and the jig is up. The jig is up in a big, big way. No, you're the colluders. You're
[15:55.760 --> 16:00.200]  the people that hate America. You're the left.
[16:00.200 --> 16:03.960]  Our grandparents, the great grandparents, knew that they canned food during the falls.
[16:03.960 --> 16:09.240]  They'd have it during the winter. And that's what I'm talking about at M4sTour.com. With

[20:21.760 --> 20:41.400]  All right, I want to open the phones up in the next segment, specifically on what do
[20:41.400 --> 20:48.800]  you think of Muller? A lot of people say, well, it's added credibility to Muller now
[20:48.800 --> 20:55.080]  because he didn't find a collusion. No, there was none. There were low-level campaign
[20:55.080 --> 20:59.080]  aides that the Russians talked to. There were a few Russian ambassadors and people
[20:59.080 --> 21:04.800]  that went to big campaign events trying to meet with the guy after he was the nominee.
[21:04.800 --> 21:09.160]  That's standard. There was General Flynn when Trump was president-elect already making
[21:09.160 --> 21:17.280]  contact with the Chinese, Russian, British, French, Mexican, all the major leaders. Canadian.
[21:17.280 --> 21:24.280]  What you see the control corporate press knew that the public didn't know standard procedure.
[21:24.280 --> 21:29.000]  So they made everything Trump did look like some giant criminal activity. So they had
[21:29.000 --> 21:34.520]  that first G20 meeting and Putin was there. It was like, what did he say as they walked
[21:34.520 --> 21:37.960]  down the hall of their leaders? They talked to each other for up to a minute. It was like
[21:37.960 --> 21:45.680]  done, done, done, proof of treason. Then when Trump, six months after he should have in
[21:45.680 --> 21:50.960]  office, should have won his first meetings, a superpower nuclear weapons, they send the
[21:50.960 --> 21:55.960]  Russian ambassador Lavrov and he meets with Trump for like an hour and it's like, prison
[21:55.960 --> 22:02.520]  ladies and gentlemen, Trump met us. The president meets with foreign leaders. He's the head
[22:02.520 --> 22:07.640]  of a branch of government. But we had to watch this and, you know, it's surreal when you're
[22:07.640 --> 22:11.600]  walking through a hotel lobby or at the grocery store and you hear, F you, you Russian, I
[22:11.600 --> 22:17.520]  hope you go to prison or die. You turn it some businessman or it's a business woman.
[22:17.520 --> 22:23.720]  It's those with their kids. You're like, I'm an American patriot. Shut up, traitor. Stay
[22:23.720 --> 22:31.040]  away from us. And it's just very twilight zone. It's like, you're a Martian space alien.
[22:31.040 --> 22:39.360]  None of it's true, but you're just like, but these are conformist leftist. They watch
[22:39.360 --> 22:57.240]  PBS and CNN and they believe it's God. They believe every word of it. And to them, this
[22:57.240 --> 23:05.560]  is their whole identity. And because it's not true, they're freaking out. I have personally,
[23:05.560 --> 23:09.200]  since this happened on Friday, since we heard the report came out, no collusion, not confirmed
[23:09.200 --> 23:13.800]  by the attorney general, set to publish almost all the reports, except for some secret names
[23:13.800 --> 23:22.760]  and sources. And I'll just be walking down the street and all of a sudden as soon as
[23:22.760 --> 23:30.880]  I just pull their car up and I'm like, they literally think I'm like, yes, I am with the
[23:30.880 --> 23:38.040]  FSB. I can make my orders from a book in this. And if you say to him, hey, Hillary got hundreds
[23:38.040 --> 23:42.680]  of millions of dollars from Uranium One, hey, you know, the globalists want to get rid of
[23:42.680 --> 23:49.400]  our country and then shift to shut up racists, shut up Nazis, shut up, and then they try
[23:49.400 --> 24:01.280]  to attack you. And their spirit is just as small. That's what they do because they're
[24:01.280 --> 24:09.720]  virtue signals. They don't produce. They lie. And our big, rich, powerful, free market country
[24:09.720 --> 24:15.880]  has created a climate. You've seen it at the Grand Canyon. You've heard about it in Japan
[24:15.880 --> 24:20.440]  with those monkeys that are so fat that live by the volcanic hot springs that, you know,
[24:20.440 --> 24:27.440]  the equivalent of like 500 pound men are so fat, the ratio of obesity. And they're just
[24:27.440 --> 24:31.360]  totally lazy, hateful, mean. Suddenly when there's no work to do, because everybody just
[24:31.360 --> 24:35.520]  gives them food, they're mean to each other. They do bad things. They throw poop people's
[24:35.520 --> 24:39.240]  cars that give them food. When you pull up to give them food, they get mad at you and
[24:39.240 --> 24:44.680]  scream at you. Just 50 years ago, they wouldn't even get in the pools. We're scared of humans.
[24:44.680 --> 24:55.200]  Now they run everything. That is the mindset. And because no one's ever stood up to these
[24:55.200 --> 25:08.920]  little spulbrats, they believe they're God. It's unbelievable. So the question to callers
[25:08.920 --> 25:18.040]  at 877-789-2539, where do you think this goes next? 877-789-2539, 877-789-Alex. Let me tell
[25:18.040 --> 25:24.840]  you something. The corporate media is such liars. Twice yesterday, I had leftist one
[25:24.840 --> 25:32.840]  time a guy slowed his car down when I was downtown to go eat dinner with Joe Rogan.
[25:32.840 --> 25:39.920]  And another time, when these people were confronting me at a restaurant and then telling security
[25:39.920 --> 25:43.760]  that I'd come over to their table when they were on record coming over to me, I just stood
[25:43.760 --> 25:48.880]  up to them and they go, where's your kids? Aha, I lost your kids. They're like, well,
[25:48.880 --> 25:55.480]  they're at home with the Danny. I didn't say that. I've got my kids 95% of the time. But
[25:55.480 --> 25:59.560]  the media says I lost my kids. The media says we're bankrupt and have been shut down. The
[25:59.560 --> 26:03.480]  media says we're losers because to the left, it doesn't matter if info wars is just as
[26:03.480 --> 26:09.120]  successful as it's ever been in a way even stronger, more hardened, more focused. Our
[26:09.120 --> 26:15.960]  listeners understand the score. We're more battle hardened. But the left doesn't care.
[26:15.960 --> 26:24.340]  They want a simulation in their head. But when I'm in an airport, this has happened
[26:24.340 --> 26:32.320]  every time I've flown in the last two years, when they see me with all four of my children.
[26:32.320 --> 26:36.080]  Sometimes right in front of my wife and kids, they come over and they go, F you and F your
[26:36.080 --> 26:43.520]  family. And my 14 year old son, he's 16 now said, Hey, man, that's not very nice. And
[26:43.520 --> 26:48.640]  they said F you want to fight and two grown men bowed up to him. And then when I came
[26:48.640 --> 26:55.920]  over, they ran off. That's who the left are, ladies and gentlemen. And you have to understand
[26:55.920 --> 27:04.280]  that there's no end to them. You understand there's no end to these people. They're entitled.
[27:04.280 --> 27:07.240]  They've been brought up in universities in their own bubble where they're allowed to
[27:07.240 --> 27:11.280]  intimidate, attack anybody they want. And they're now supposed to come out and conquer
[27:11.280 --> 27:15.400]  the world. Hillary was supposed to win. They were supposed to all get big, high powered
[27:15.400 --> 27:19.800]  jobs. They were supposed to run our lives. They were born to rule, born to run like
[27:19.800 --> 27:26.000]  Beto, a shot of him out in the desert where he doesn't even live in Grand Canyon, 200
[27:26.000 --> 27:30.640]  miles from where he even lives. And it's like, the profit is here. They go, Are you a profit?
[27:30.640 --> 27:38.320]  He says, I was born for this. Yes. I want to see say he says, The question, Trump is
[27:38.320 --> 27:46.880]  a Russian agent today. Well, if Russian agents get thousands of new factories and strengthen
[27:46.880 --> 27:52.080]  our military and take care of the veterans and stand up against censorship and get us
[27:52.080 --> 27:57.680]  out of foreign TPP that took our sovereignty, boy, we sure need more Russians running things.
[27:57.680 --> 28:07.040]  No, Trump's a hardcore American. And he's from a winning country. And he knows we're
[28:07.040 --> 28:12.560]  going to dominate if we just promote American values. And he isn't part of the sick, chai
[28:12.560 --> 28:17.200]  calm, loving cult that sold the country out. And now under his leadership, we're learning
[28:17.200 --> 28:23.720]  about the treason that we told you about with Google and all the rest, these big telecoms.
[28:23.720 --> 28:28.120]  And I was told by sources just settle down, Alex, as soon as the Mueller report comes
[28:28.120 --> 28:33.040]  out, Trump's dropping the hammer. He's not going to wait till the next election to stop
[28:33.040 --> 28:39.920]  the censorship. He knows he's suckering them in so that they get really arrogant and admit
[28:39.920 --> 28:45.200]  it all. And it's true. As soon as the CEOs went on TV and admitted, okay, we are censoring
[28:45.200 --> 28:52.340]  and we're going to do more. Trump went, Oh, well, that's illegal then. So he definitely
[28:52.340 --> 29:09.320]  has patience. He's 72 on 45. Stay with us.

[31:01.800 --> 31:06.320]  so long. Go ahead. Yeah, I just have to say something, man. It seems like every time I
[31:06.320 --> 31:11.160]  turn on your broadcast, you're bragging. It just gets old now. I'm going to shut you
[31:11.160 --> 31:16.360]  down right now, okay? We're taking calls about your nomination. Do you understand they're
[31:16.360 --> 31:21.320]  having congressional hearings trying to shut us down? Do you understand I'm ringing the
[31:21.320 --> 31:25.880]  alarm? If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out. I mean, what's it going
[31:25.880 --> 31:30.560]  to take us being shut down? Is that what you want, Frank? You know what, Alex? I'll put
[31:30.560 --> 31:35.680]  him on pause again. Hey, Frank, do you understand it's not bragging to say we are the tip of

[31:40.400 --> 31:44.280]  pay the bills and grow in the face of this. I'm not going to just stop growth and let

[32:01.280 --> 32:06.800]  you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing pollen block. We have found an extraordinary
[32:06.800 --> 32:12.920]  new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and
[32:12.920 --> 32:20.120]  sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function. In the 1960s, researchers in France
[32:20.120 --> 32:25.480]  noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory
[32:25.480 --> 32:30.640]  responses. They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we
[32:30.640 --> 32:36.240]  now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal
[32:36.240 --> 32:41.520]  distress symptoms. Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine.
[32:41.520 --> 32:46.200]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of
[32:46.200 --> 32:52.000]  tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[32:52.000 --> 32:57.400]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe. Head to InfowarsLife.com and grab a pack of
[32:57.400 --> 33:03.560]  our pollen block chewable tablets.
[33:03.560 --> 33:14.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[33:14.240 --> 33:20.400]  Welcome back. You found it. The tip of the spear, the most hated broadcast in the world.
[33:20.400 --> 33:27.840]  By pedophiles, comics, terrors. Live from Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones
[33:27.840 --> 33:28.840]  Show.
[33:28.840 --> 33:39.160]  By the way, there's just too much gold to get to even a 10% of it, but at newswars.com,
[33:39.160 --> 33:43.880]  if you're a radio listener, you definitely want to go look at collusion, delusion, dims,
[33:43.880 --> 33:52.320]  best, Mueller meltdown memes. After two-plus years of the harassment, the attacks, there's
[33:52.320 --> 33:56.680]  got to be at least 10 congressional hearings I watched where they would just go, Alex Jones
[33:56.680 --> 34:06.480]  is a Russian agent, needs to be shut down. He takes his orders. And Obama set up that
[34:06.480 --> 34:11.960]  CIA stay behind that work and they shut down almost everybody. So you can say, oh, well,
[34:11.960 --> 34:18.160]  haha, no collusion. They use that cover to turn intelligence agencies loose on the American
[34:18.160 --> 34:25.120]  people and censor the living hell out of everybody. So it's satisfying that they couldn't dig
[34:25.120 --> 34:28.680]  anything up or make anything up, but it's kind of like having your legs chopped off and then
[34:28.680 --> 34:35.000]  come at how it's satisfied because they didn't get your throat slit yet. And believe me,
[34:35.000 --> 34:40.760]  with that whole big fake dragnet, they dug up lots of dirt on Trump associates for taxes
[34:40.760 --> 34:47.560]  or checks or girlfriends. And the next phase, I told you it was coming, but they said it's
[34:47.560 --> 34:55.080]  coming. I see one of the callers is making the point that the Dems are already saying,
[34:55.080 --> 35:02.480]  Mueller sold out. Oh, yeah, right. The establishment guy brought in works with the Clintons, the
[35:02.480 --> 35:09.920]  Bushes, Obama, all of them. There's no Russia collusion. They grilled everyone trying to
[35:09.920 --> 35:15.480]  get people to make something up. The best they had was one of the Trump people talked
[35:15.480 --> 35:19.680]  to a Russian agent at a bar in Italy and then got questioned about it a year later and forgot
[35:19.680 --> 35:28.240]  about it. Oh my gosh, he talked to a Russian. It's kind of like the beginning of that great
[35:28.240 --> 35:34.440]  movie, Aliens, sir, is this going to be another bug hunt? Like, who's that? Apparently she's
[35:34.440 --> 35:51.000]  thought an alien. Apparently he talked to a Russian once. Oh my gosh. You know, I just
[35:51.000 --> 35:58.520]  can't help but have to tell the truth. You know what? I'm not going to say it on here.
[35:58.520 --> 36:06.600]  I had Jack Pesovic on Friday and I basically said it then. But you know, these Google executives
[36:06.600 --> 36:11.440]  and people helping oppress the Chinese people, giving them all our secret, our technology.
[36:11.440 --> 36:15.880]  If a colonel in the military gave one, one million to the Chinese, something like that,
[36:15.880 --> 36:22.440]  never even get tried. They'd be killed. You signed on for that. You should be. And I know
[36:22.440 --> 36:25.840]  there's a lot of money and everybody's been bought off by China, but my God, we've been
[36:25.840 --> 36:32.760]  sold out and the audacity to point their fingers at people like me and Trump and say, we're
[36:32.760 --> 36:40.680]  on foreign payrolls. No, you are and you know it scum. And I'm not going to do anything
[36:40.680 --> 36:48.680]  to you because that's not my department. But the worm is turning. Doesn't mean if I needed
[36:48.680 --> 36:53.680]  to, I wouldn't. You're found guilty of treason. They want me to kick the switch to open that
[36:53.680 --> 36:58.960]  trap door and drop your neck down and snap that son of a bitch. I swear to God, I'll pull
[36:58.960 --> 37:05.800]  those levers all day because I'm sick of your crap. You're not just traders selling us out
[37:05.800 --> 37:09.360]  to horrible authoritarian regime that's killed way more than Hitler did. You're trying to
[37:09.360 --> 37:18.960]  take my freedoms and lock my ass up to quote Emperor Palpatine. No, no, no, you will die.
[37:18.960 --> 37:29.080]  Anyways, I've just had enough. I am not a trader. I am an American. That's all I've
[37:29.080 --> 37:33.800]  ever done. Everyone knows it's all my family's ever done. And I am sick of these traders
[37:33.800 --> 37:37.360]  pissing all over the country and getting away with it. I said, I'd give these clips to go
[37:37.360 --> 37:45.760]  to your calls. I'm sorry. You try having your phones tapped. You try getting followed around
[37:45.760 --> 37:49.000]  by the FBI where they want you to know they're out in the parking lot. You try and questioning
[37:49.000 --> 37:53.080]  your friends and family. You try the whole system trying to bankrupt you and they know
[37:53.080 --> 38:04.040]  full damn well you have no connections to foreign powers. It's disgusting. Again, I'm
[38:04.040 --> 38:10.280]  not saying 99% of the FBI is involved. It's the special dirty units. And this is a big
[38:10.280 --> 38:14.640]  defeat for them. Believe me, they thought they'd find something. My God, you go to DC.
[38:14.640 --> 38:20.880]  These Russian and Chinese and Indian and Mexican and Saudi and Qatari money and Dubai money
[38:20.880 --> 38:29.240]  just flying everywhere. So they thought, well, there's got to be something because they're
[38:29.240 --> 38:37.200]  all knee-deep in it. A lot of them over their heads. But there wasn't because Trump doesn't
[38:37.200 --> 38:44.680]  trust anybody and runs everything himself. And that's why you're so scared as he's the
[38:44.680 --> 38:48.760]  total outsider. Just like I'm a total outsider. I don't want to be in DC around all you people.
[38:48.760 --> 38:53.960]  I don't need to be around your establishment to think I've arrived. I've arrived genetically,
[38:53.960 --> 39:00.040]  spiritually. I don't want to be around you. There was some free open country better than
[39:00.040 --> 39:05.640]  this one. I'd get out of here. I went without the middle of nowhere. So don't you ever try
[39:05.640 --> 39:13.280]  to say I'm you. And this is a big repudiation of your treasonous garbage. So it is a victory.
[39:13.280 --> 39:17.640]  But they're not going to give up. Here's Mark Dice breaking down some of their whining
[39:17.640 --> 39:22.320]  and peeling. Once things didn't come through the way they wanted it, here it is.
[39:22.320 --> 39:26.600]  Well, Robert Mueller has finally ended his investigation into the Trump-Russia collusion
[39:26.600 --> 39:32.720]  conspiracy theories and handed his big nothing burger of a report into the attorney general's
[39:32.720 --> 39:37.160]  office. Before we take a look at how the liberal media is reacting to the news that there will
[39:37.160 --> 39:42.640]  be no impeachment, let's take a quick trip down memory lane. You told the Washington
[39:42.640 --> 39:47.320]  Post last week that, quote, there's a smell of treason in the air when it comes to this
[39:47.320 --> 39:52.240]  investigation. We are looking at the possibility that the president of the United States and
[39:52.240 --> 39:58.640]  those around him during an election campaign colluded with a hostile foreign power to undermine
[39:58.640 --> 40:06.120]  the basis of our democracy. Donald Trump now sits at the threshold of impeachment. There's
[40:06.120 --> 40:12.160]  outright treason. I mean, there is no question that what he is doing is giving aid and comfort
[40:12.160 --> 40:16.600]  to the enemy. It does look like collusion. It does look like he's listening to Putin
[40:16.600 --> 40:21.640]  more than he is American intelligence. And frankly, I've never seen that before. Vladimir
[40:21.640 --> 40:26.880]  Putin and his associates, somebody has something on Donald Trump. We're hearing a new word,
[40:26.880 --> 40:31.960]  he said it was treason. Do you believe that the Trump campaign colluded with the Russians
[40:31.960 --> 40:37.760]  in the 2016 campaign? Yes. Do you believe the president himself colluded with the Russians?
[40:37.760 --> 40:41.200]  Yes, he colluded. I don't think that's a hard answer to the question. I certainly say with
[40:41.200 --> 40:47.160]  confidence that there is significant evidence of collusion between the campaign and Russia.
[40:47.160 --> 40:52.280]  It's beyond the shout of a doubt to me that if there was not collusion, there was at least
[40:52.280 --> 40:57.720]  the effort to collude with a foreign power. And then the report then goes into the fact
[40:57.720 --> 41:00.320]  that they now have to admit that that's not the case. We'll come back and play some more
[41:00.320 --> 41:04.520]  of that in a moment. But I wanted to play Maxine Waters. She says, oh, nothing stops.
[41:04.520 --> 41:10.080]  We just go forward. Now remember, this is the lady that wants to get rid of our borders.
[41:10.080 --> 41:12.520]  This is the lady that wants to get rid of our sovereignty. She's the lady that says America
[41:12.520 --> 41:18.000]  sucks. She says drain the swamp came from Putin with no proof. Here's Maxine Waters flipping
[41:18.000 --> 41:23.080]  out. And you have Donald Trump supporters, including his former U.N. Ambassador Nikki
[41:23.080 --> 41:29.080]  Haley out there tweeting and saying essentially presuming that the president has been exonerated
[41:29.080 --> 41:34.120]  by the report and in Nikki Haley's case, saying that it's been completed and everyone should
[41:34.120 --> 41:40.000]  just move on. It's a curious position to take since we don't know what's in the report.
[41:40.000 --> 41:44.440]  But do you see colleagues on the other side of the aisle sort of declaring this whole
[41:44.440 --> 41:48.800]  thing at an end, uh, and wanting no further inquiry? I know that the house has something
[41:48.800 --> 41:54.640]  like 80 subpoenas still out. Absolutely. Well, I want to tell you that this president has
[41:54.640 --> 42:00.240]  a way of trying to get into people's heads and indoctrinate them. He's been saying no
[42:00.240 --> 42:05.600]  collusion, no collusion, no collusion over and over again for a long time now. And he's
[42:05.600 --> 42:11.680]  going to try and conclude that there this report is proving that there's no collusion.
[42:11.680 --> 42:16.520]  You have a lot of his sickle fans who will, you know, take the nod from him and they'll
[42:16.520 --> 42:22.520]  say the same thing. Uh, but we cannot allow them to get away with this. He does this all
[42:22.520 --> 42:29.520]  the time. This is not the end of anything. This is the, well, it's the end of the report
[42:29.520 --> 42:30.520]  and the investigation.
[42:30.520 --> 42:39.640]  Let's stop there. So now Trump runs Mueller. No, that's, that's not true. There is nothing
[42:39.640 --> 42:43.240]  except you getting 30 something million, your corrupt husband, a taxpayer money, and you're
[42:43.240 --> 42:49.960]  a damn crook. That's just what a damn crook. I mean, Maxine Waters is an America hating
[42:49.960 --> 42:56.200]  witch dirty as the day is long. And then she points her finger at us and says, we're trading
[42:56.200 --> 43:02.440]  the country out when we're doing the opposite. I've got some really good news, though. X

[43:22.520 --> 43:27.240]  the scientists that do that, it sold a lot that people want original X two. Well, I was
[43:27.240 --> 43:31.080]  resigned the fact we didn't have X two, but it came through about a month ago. We now
[43:31.080 --> 43:36.160]  have X two again and info or store.com. So hallelujah. It's been sold out for about almost

[48:27.400 --> 48:29.200]  So we have the special counsel.
[48:31.720 --> 48:36.960]  After two plus years, a giant dragnet and all they could find was one of Trump's lawyers
[48:36.960 --> 48:43.120]  didn't pay $5 million in taxes for a taxi company he had that had zero to do with Trump.
[48:44.160 --> 48:48.440]  And another lawyer in Chicago that was the one of the lawyers on Trump Tower there and
[48:48.440 --> 48:53.120]  his own personal tax deal as well. And then a few other lawyers.
[48:53.120 --> 48:59.680]  So a giant dragnet, a national security dragnet looking into everything warrantless spying.
[49:00.360 --> 49:07.720]  Trump has basically had a magnifying glass put on him that has never been done to a president
[49:07.720 --> 49:14.920]  in US history. It's the equivalent of a proctology exam every day, a dental exam every day. I
[49:14.920 --> 49:24.560]  mean, it's complete and there's nothing there. He'll been trying to set up Trump for 45 years.
[49:26.080 --> 49:30.400]  When he bought up golf courses because the old rich white people wouldn't let blacks,
[49:30.400 --> 49:34.440]  Hispanics or Jews or Asians be on them. They were all falling apart because all the weird
[49:34.440 --> 49:38.440]  old white people wouldn't let anybody in, but they were all like 90 years old and wouldn't
[49:38.440 --> 49:41.920]  let anybody in. Trump bought them up for nothing, but they'd come after him when he bought
[49:41.920 --> 49:48.600]  them up. It's famous. And they would look for any dirt they could with the local government
[49:48.600 --> 49:53.760]  and they couldn't find it. Trump knows not having dirt is a good thing, just like me.
[49:53.760 --> 49:59.320]  There's no dirt. And I watch people try to always manufacture it, always like act like
[49:59.320 --> 50:02.160]  something we're doing is dirty or something we're doing is bad. Now we do things that
[50:02.160 --> 50:07.080]  are private and secret so the enemy doesn't know where to hit us, but we don't do anything
[50:07.080 --> 50:15.240]  illegal. I don't even speed anymore. I just have a little bit of a heavy foot. Very rarely.
[50:15.240 --> 50:19.680]  Today I got on the highway and was going like 60 and the car had like a hundred car links
[50:19.680 --> 50:25.520]  behind me probably way back there. Come zoom on up like a hundred on my ass. No kids in
[50:25.520 --> 50:31.120]  the car, no cars around me. All right, boom, 100 about three seconds and like, whoa, they
[50:31.120 --> 50:34.640]  are like, yeah. So I mean, I'm not going to live for once in a while. I get a little
[50:34.640 --> 50:39.480]  of a left foot. Maybe five times a year instead of five times a day now, though I never with
[50:39.480 --> 50:44.440]  my kids around or the highways busy. It's still not good. I shouldn't do it. My wife's
[50:44.440 --> 50:52.560]  like sell the Hellcat and just drive your F 150. And it's true. But I'm digressing.
[50:52.560 --> 50:57.840]  That's it. You want to get me on something? That's it. I did it today. And it was really
[50:57.840 --> 51:02.000]  funny because there's these young kids and these little bit of Japanese cars like fast
[51:02.000 --> 51:06.280]  and furious. They really think they're really fast. And they've got this thing about running
[51:06.280 --> 51:10.920]  up on the ass of your car. And if you're driving a real powerful muscle car, you just blast
[51:10.920 --> 51:15.080]  past them. Okay. I'm sorry. I'm digressing. You don't do them for that. And I want to
[51:15.080 --> 51:19.360]  go to your phone calls. We'll start your calls next hour. Preston and Chase and Heather and
[51:19.360 --> 51:24.880]  Matthew in Virginia and Jim and Mike and David and Greg and Dennis and pastor and everybody
[51:24.880 --> 51:30.240]  else. But getting back to this, since I mentioned the Mark Dice piece here, here's Mark just
[51:30.240 --> 51:34.160]  playing some of the clips. I've got like a 10 minute compilation here, but here's a shorter,
[51:34.160 --> 51:38.920]  probably better. The video is up on infowars.com and Mark Dice.com. Here's some of them having
[51:38.920 --> 51:44.080]  to admit that, okay, there's no collusion in the report. And now summary's been sent.
[51:44.080 --> 51:47.120]  And now the full report's going to probably be released. They rarely do that because there's
[51:47.120 --> 51:50.480]  your names of sources and things. But other than those being cut out, it's going to be
[51:50.480 --> 51:53.320]  pretty much unredacted. Here it is.
[51:53.320 --> 51:58.160]  Beyond the shadow of a doubt to me that if there was not collusion, there was at least
[51:58.160 --> 52:03.720]  the effort to collude with a foreign power. Let's go now to MSNBC's Mika Brzezinski for
[52:03.720 --> 52:08.080]  the latest because I'm sure that the final round of indictments have been issued and that
[52:08.080 --> 52:13.960]  those in Trump's inner circle are being arrested at this very moment. ABC News citing sources
[52:13.960 --> 52:18.960]  familiar with the investigation reporting that no more indictments are coming from the
[52:18.960 --> 52:23.760]  special counsel. The report also highlights a letter from Deputy Attorney General Rod
[52:23.760 --> 52:28.360]  Rudd. She just called the Ron Burgundy there. No more indictments are coming. But Mika
[52:28.360 --> 52:32.800]  Lavinatti guaranteed that at least Donald Trump Jr. would get indicted for lying to
[52:32.800 --> 52:38.040]  the special counsel. Nope, wrong again, moron. But surely the report says that the White
[52:38.040 --> 52:42.840]  House and the Attorney General's office tried to interfere in the Mueller investigation.
[52:42.840 --> 52:47.480]  Right, Rachel Mandel? He's notifying Congress formally there was never anything the special
[52:47.480 --> 52:54.280]  counsel sought to do that Bill Barr stopped Mueller from doing. This is a woman who was
[52:54.280 --> 52:59.080]  literally crying moments before going to air after realizing that all of her hopes and
[52:59.080 --> 53:05.080]  dreams came crashing down. Chris Matthews isn't much happier. How can there be a charge
[53:05.080 --> 53:12.840]  here or a claim of a collusion? Normally the term is advancing a Russian conspiracy to
[53:12.840 --> 53:20.600]  interfere and screw with our elections basically. How can that blame, that accusation be laid
[53:20.600 --> 53:26.920]  against the president by Mueller if he's not indicting any of Trump's people here?
[53:26.920 --> 53:29.440]  So thank you for having me, Chris. I've been listening to the questions you've been raising.
[53:29.440 --> 53:33.040]  I think they're important ones, but I think it's hard to speculate until we've actually
[53:33.040 --> 53:37.400]  seen the report. I'm asking, I'm not speculating. Why didn't he, why didn't he indict? We were
[53:37.400 --> 53:42.360]  told by a DOJ official tonight there will be no indictments. That means no indictments
[53:42.360 --> 53:48.680]  about collusion. Does that startle you with after all these meetings? The reason is, Chris,
[53:48.680 --> 53:55.000]  there's no evidence for that. That's right. That's enough. Thank you, Mark. Yeah. If there
[53:55.000 --> 54:00.680]  isn't any evidence and it didn't happen just because you said it yourself probably 5,000
[54:00.680 --> 54:05.360]  times the last two years, Chris, and the rest of the media 100,000 times or more, just because
[54:05.360 --> 54:12.160]  you keep saying two plus two equals seven, it always equals four. It doesn't equal seven.
[54:12.160 --> 54:21.600]  It doesn't equal 100. It doesn't equal 75 billion, 371. No, two plus two equals four.
[54:21.600 --> 54:24.240]  Now I want to go to this because we consider and laugh about this all day, but it's not
[54:24.240 --> 54:30.520]  funny. I've got a whole stack of articles here that are up on him for wars.com and news wars.com.
[54:30.520 --> 54:34.360]  You can read all the reporters names. They didn't ban James Woods because he's still
[54:34.360 --> 54:43.600]  got a voice, but the lady that tweeted the image of Rachel Maddow crying MSNBC got angry,
[54:43.600 --> 54:46.920]  of course, and complained. And just like I got banned from Twitter, the final straw was
[54:46.920 --> 54:51.480]  saying that Oliver Darcy, who gets people banned as a punk to his face. I said, you're
[54:51.480 --> 54:56.080]  a modern book burner. Shame on you. He's a public figure at work at Congress. I tell
[54:56.080 --> 55:00.440]  him how dare you and dress him down. I was taken down because you don't criticize public
[55:00.440 --> 55:07.960]  figures. Well, stories up on info wars.com Twitter bans user for laughing at Rachel Maddow's
[55:07.960 --> 55:13.560]  tears of despair over Mueller report. Here it is.
[55:13.560 --> 55:24.000]  To do that, Bill Barr stopped Mueller from doing. And that's from Robert Mueller as well
[55:24.000 --> 55:30.120]  as from Bill Barr. At this point, it's only Bill Barr who was speaking on Mueller's behalf.
[55:30.120 --> 55:35.600]  Robert Mueller is still at this point publicly silent as he has been from the very beginning,
[55:35.600 --> 55:44.800]  although we'll have more on that in a moment. That's what got banned. Laughing at a public
[55:44.800 --> 55:50.840]  figure when I have these levels, confront me in a restaurant and wait outside for me when
[55:50.840 --> 55:55.480]  I came out, chant death to me and all this stuff. And then when the security came, they
[55:55.480 --> 56:00.920]  went, he came to us. He's harassing us. It's what they did in the headline on Reddit was
[56:00.920 --> 56:07.160]  Alex Jones can't deal with criticism and that just attacks innocent people for no reason.
[56:07.160 --> 56:12.280]  See, that's how it works. They're the ones that can't handle criticism. They're the ones
[56:12.280 --> 56:18.200]  that can't handle speech. They're the ones that can't handle any of it. They want to
[56:18.200 --> 56:23.160]  slap you in the back of the head, pour coffee on you. And then when you chase them down,
[56:23.160 --> 56:28.520]  they get mad at you because you're supposed to just sit there and take it. You're supposed
[56:28.520 --> 56:33.160]  to be one dimensional. We're going to go to break. Come back with your phone calls. I've
[56:33.160 --> 56:37.320]  got a lot more obviously and a couple of other big issues we haven't hit yet. We've covered
[56:37.320 --> 56:43.440]  some positive things. We have some really positive things I haven't hit. The SPLC implodes
[56:43.440 --> 56:47.840]  president and legal director resigned amid sexual misconduct scandal. That's not even
[56:47.840 --> 56:52.120]  half the story. I'll break down the rest of story when we come back. Please don't forget.

[59:53.520 --> 1:00:20.640]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show. We now take you live. We are alive. We are
[1:00:20.640 --> 1:00:29.760]  alive. Broadcasting worldwide. Out on the road for 25 years. We now take you live to the
[1:00:29.760 --> 1:00:35.880]  Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance. You're listening to Alex
[1:00:35.880 --> 1:00:44.960]  Jones. All right, rest of the hour. It's your call. Greg Reese at a very powerful report
[1:00:44.960 --> 1:00:52.520]  dealing with why you can't question Christchurch in New Zealand. And I'm not even questioning
[1:00:52.520 --> 1:00:56.320]  that people didn't die. The guy said he's trying to cause a revolution. Why can't you
[1:00:56.320 --> 1:01:00.280]  question it? Why are they censoring? It's very dangerous. It's never happened before.
[1:01:00.280 --> 1:01:05.240]  That's really unifies us. If that's coming up in the last segment of this hour. There's
[1:01:05.240 --> 1:01:10.240]  a lot of really positive news as well. But I'm going to go ahead and go to your calls
[1:01:10.240 --> 1:01:17.880]  right now. And we're going to talk about the Mueller report. What's coming next? Well,
[1:01:17.880 --> 1:01:21.440]  Mueller get away. She got free all briefly. We start the next segment. Give you my take
[1:01:21.440 --> 1:01:27.440]  on it. But yeah, they're lucky. They're not all indicted because the way they went about
[1:01:27.440 --> 1:01:33.320]  this whole investigation was fraudulent. They lied to Congress and I can tell you behind
[1:01:33.320 --> 1:01:38.920]  the scenes, there's been a truth supposedly made by the bodies. But I wouldn't trust the
[1:01:38.920 --> 1:01:45.480]  globalists as far as you could throw them. I don't just want wars and internal strife
[1:01:45.480 --> 1:01:49.160]  for no reason. I'm not like the globalists that want to mount everybody's head on the
[1:01:49.160 --> 1:01:53.720]  wall. So I feel dominant, but these people, there's no honor amongst these people. So
[1:01:53.720 --> 1:01:56.160]  this is a big victory though, because they came up empty, but they're going to try to
[1:01:56.160 --> 1:02:00.160]  regroup. So a lot of people think that, you know, we can all just sell off in the sunset
[1:02:00.160 --> 1:02:05.080]  together. Dennis, you think the left's going to implode? They're already imploding. I want
[1:02:05.080 --> 1:02:09.840]  to put out an alert for any public figures, Christians, conservatives, well-known people.
[1:02:09.840 --> 1:02:15.240]  They are out. They are usually one of them tries to assault me every two weeks or so.
[1:02:15.240 --> 1:02:21.040]  Twice yesterday, the day before, I've been thrown out of businesses I'm in now, but they
[1:02:21.040 --> 1:02:26.400]  just see I'm in them. They are women just walk up and start crying and hyperventilating
[1:02:26.400 --> 1:02:33.040]  them. Get out of here. Get out. I mean, they're already imploding. What do you think is going
[1:02:33.040 --> 1:02:38.640]  to happen? Well, technically, they are going to implode. What's happening now, you will
[1:02:38.640 --> 1:02:44.120]  start seeing them eat at each other at a rapid rate. They will start bringing up the negative
[1:02:44.120 --> 1:02:49.000]  stuff that each one of them have done, but it's going to be done during that presidential
[1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:53.840]  debate. They have so many people. You're going to watch the ultimate show on the Democrat
[1:02:53.840 --> 1:02:59.320]  Party. This is about to be it. I'm telling you, 2020, we are moving straightforward.
[1:02:59.320 --> 1:03:03.720]  There ain't no turning back for us now. You know, I agree with you. What is the phenomenon
[1:03:03.720 --> 1:03:07.960]  about leftists all over the world that they have to bring people down so they're always
[1:03:07.960 --> 1:03:13.720]  backbiting each other? They're their own worst problem. That's because they just like a bait
[1:03:13.720 --> 1:03:18.560]  or a walk set. He was made for this. This is the mentality of these people. They're
[1:03:18.560 --> 1:03:22.520]  showing you, you're supposed to heal to me. I think that what Hillary Clinton said about
[1:03:22.520 --> 1:03:28.120]  black people. You have to look at it. Look at it. These people think they're the elite
[1:03:28.120 --> 1:03:33.760]  ruling class politically. That's it. Just let them, let them do what they do. No, you're
[1:03:33.760 --> 1:03:40.320]  right. They want everybody to heal to them like a dog. Exactly. One way shape, form or
[1:03:40.320 --> 1:03:43.080]  fashion doesn't make a difference. It will start with your censorship. Then we're going
[1:03:43.080 --> 1:03:47.240]  to come and get your guns. And then after that, Hey, we're going to turn this into China.
[1:03:47.240 --> 1:03:52.280]  Please start giving us your kids. You can only have two kids. One of them better be a girl.
[1:03:52.280 --> 1:03:59.400]  I'm telling you, that's just a mentality model. That's the model. That is the leftist model.
[1:03:59.400 --> 1:04:04.520]  They've been taking everything that George Soros has thrown at them, all that money.
[1:04:04.520 --> 1:04:11.040]  Guess what? Going to have to pay the piper now. Dennis, don't hang up. Your points are
[1:04:11.040 --> 1:04:15.400]  so good. I want you to repeat them and expand on when we come back from break because you're
[1:04:15.400 --> 1:04:20.040]  and I want to hear what you think should have come next, but that's exactly right. And I've
[1:04:20.040 --> 1:04:23.760]  learned with the left to, especially with their minions, it's all about the illusion
[1:04:23.760 --> 1:04:29.440]  of power. They'll wait for you outside a restaurant to say, get out of here, get out of here.
[1:04:29.440 --> 1:04:33.200]  When they knew I was already going to my car. So they would feel powerful when I left. Like
[1:04:33.200 --> 1:04:38.120]  that wasn't real power. And, but I mean, you just, how do you get in that mindset? You're
[1:04:38.120 --> 1:04:41.640]  absolutely right. They're, they are imploding, but will they take us down with them? Well,
[1:04:41.640 --> 1:04:44.720]  I said, it's that question. How does he think we counter it? And then I promise I'm going
[1:04:44.720 --> 1:04:51.440]  to bam, bam, bam through your calls info wars.com, news wars.com to Mars news today.
[1:04:51.440 --> 1:04:54.480]  And I agree. Things are really looking up now with Trump fighting censorship and things,
[1:04:54.480 --> 1:04:58.880]  but let's not get too confident.
[1:04:58.880 --> 1:05:02.680]  In forward store.com is how you support us. And it's not like we're selling stuff you
[1:05:02.680 --> 1:05:08.360]  don't need. You don't want the air in the average American home is filled with toxins

[1:05:14.480 --> 1:05:20.200]  major cities. How can I solve that problem? So we have air filters at info wars store.com,

[1:05:57.360 --> 1:06:15.800]  From the front lines of the information war. It's Alex Jones. We're going to your phone
[1:06:15.800 --> 1:06:21.600]  calls right now. Robert Mueller's report was first going to come out on the first of this
[1:06:21.600 --> 1:06:30.920]  month. It was going to be the 27th. He released it on the 22nd. And now the attorney general
[1:06:30.920 --> 1:06:36.760]  is sent a summary to Congress and they're redacting out some sources and key names.
[1:06:36.760 --> 1:06:41.120]  The FBI is asking for and they're going to reportedly release it in the next few days.
[1:06:41.120 --> 1:06:44.800]  I always do. There was no collusion and they couldn't get anybody for plea bargains to
[1:06:44.800 --> 1:06:53.040]  make it up. But what do they do now? I'm telling people. You don't know what it's like to be
[1:06:53.040 --> 1:06:56.680]  Trump or his family unless you're a public figure that's been a Trump supporter. I have
[1:06:56.680 --> 1:07:03.840]  and I'm not complaining. I'm just telling you something. I try to go anywhere in downtown
[1:07:03.840 --> 1:07:15.040]  Austin or I try to go to Whole Foods or I try to go to a restaurant and I may shake 30 hands.
[1:07:15.040 --> 1:07:22.480]  But in the last two days since this happened, I get confronted everywhere I go and they
[1:07:22.480 --> 1:07:28.840]  are violent and they are angry. And after they threaten you, they run and call security
[1:07:28.840 --> 1:07:43.000]  on you. These people are crazy and dangerous. And they really believe MSNBC and CNN. They
[1:07:43.000 --> 1:07:49.120]  really are that whacked out and I don't know what's going to come next. You were making
[1:07:49.120 --> 1:07:53.280]  some great points. Repeat those and then my question, Dennis, is you said they're going
[1:07:53.280 --> 1:07:56.800]  to implode what's that going to look like and are they going to take us with them?
[1:07:56.800 --> 1:08:05.160]  Well, it's not so much. All right. The implosion of them is the politically elite class who
[1:08:05.160 --> 1:08:08.840]  believe in their mind. They should have total control over you.
[1:08:08.840 --> 1:08:11.600]  Like you said, Ben O'Rourke says, I'm just born to rule you.
[1:08:11.600 --> 1:08:17.720]  Exactly. I'm born for this. But in actuality, just like you said earlier as well, it's a
[1:08:17.720 --> 1:08:22.080]  false pretense. They believe in this thing called power. Well, let's say you do get the
[1:08:22.080 --> 1:08:27.920]  power. How do you divide up the pot? Who is going to be where? Who's going to do what?
[1:08:27.920 --> 1:08:32.080]  That was the whole reason Hillary Clinton had to win. They have already divvied up this
[1:08:32.080 --> 1:08:36.280]  country how they were. That's, that's why they're so pissed. Exactly.
[1:08:36.280 --> 1:08:41.640]  They believe this was their time. Yes. This was their time. But unfortunately,
[1:08:41.640 --> 1:08:48.360]  they didn't count on real smart Americans to actually see through it. And hence comes
[1:08:48.360 --> 1:08:55.560]  Trump. It's just that simple. Everybody was sitting here wondering, how did this happen?
[1:08:55.560 --> 1:09:00.560]  Well, let's look at the chain of events you people put us through. That's just it.
[1:09:00.560 --> 1:09:06.920]  I mean, everything that is something hard happened, hard hitting the, that could possibly
[1:09:06.920 --> 1:09:13.200]  affect society. Why is there no full disclosure? Why does it take so long for those reports
[1:09:13.200 --> 1:09:18.040]  to come out? Has that, has anybody thought of that? Because you're not made to know.
[1:09:18.040 --> 1:09:25.200]  They think that the average mind here in America is so low IQ that, oh, you just shut up and
[1:09:25.200 --> 1:09:30.400]  you just do like you told. Go to work, go home, go to work, go home. Don't enjoy life.
[1:09:30.400 --> 1:09:36.400]  Hell, it's about the end in 12 years. Come on. And by the way, she's told to say that
[1:09:36.400 --> 1:09:40.880]  imagine to a young person, like adults learn to not be scared. But when I was a kid, if
[1:09:40.880 --> 1:09:45.480]  I saw a Congresswoman say the world's in it, I'd be scared at night. Yeah. And that's
[1:09:45.480 --> 1:09:51.160]  the whole thing. You need to do like we're telling you. Don't question it. You need to
[1:09:51.160 --> 1:09:57.440]  do like we're telling you. And the whole thing about it is this, Alex. This is the ultimate
[1:09:57.440 --> 1:10:05.520]  thing. How do we fix it? We start in the areas that need it. Look at Detroit with their water.
[1:10:05.520 --> 1:10:11.480]  Look at Michigan. Look at what's happening in Chicago. You think, I mean, I mean, literally
[1:10:11.480 --> 1:10:16.560]  think about the Chicago with all those cameras. I used to live there. There's a camera. It's
[1:10:16.560 --> 1:10:22.080]  not four on every street corner. So how did how did they find who did that to Jesse Small
[1:10:22.080 --> 1:10:26.840]  it? But they can't find out who killing these cops. Hmm. How is that possible? No, you're
[1:10:26.840 --> 1:10:31.320]  right. It's because the Democratic Party's a mafia and it wants it to be crime-ridden.
[1:10:31.320 --> 1:10:35.480]  And they've had the Republicans under control for a while. But I've got articles where record
[1:10:35.480 --> 1:10:40.720]  drug interceptors at the border, record indictment of drug dealers, Trump's going after pharmaceutical
[1:10:40.720 --> 1:10:44.840]  companies that are pushing OxyContin. He's actually trying to clean things up. And I
[1:10:44.840 --> 1:10:50.600]  can't believe he's actually doing it. Great points. God bless you, Dennis. Yeah, Trump's
[1:10:50.600 --> 1:10:55.040]  a miracle. And they attacked me because I say that, but it's just the truth. I mean,
[1:10:55.040 --> 1:11:02.080]  he is a miracle. But people are praying. No collusion, no obstruction, complete and total
[1:11:02.080 --> 1:11:08.640]  exoneration. Keep America great. And what is one of the top liberal journalists out
[1:11:08.640 --> 1:11:13.720]  there? Greenwald say about all this. Len Greenwald, you know, a liberal that has a conscience.
[1:11:13.720 --> 1:11:18.760]  Old fashioned liberal. All standard liberal outlets obediently said whatever they were
[1:11:18.760 --> 1:11:23.320]  told by the CIA and the FBI. Many reporters of right wing media outlets, which are routinely
[1:11:23.320 --> 1:11:28.840]  mocked by super smart liberals as primitive, propagandistic, did relentlessly great digging
[1:11:28.840 --> 1:11:41.240]  and reporting. Sorry, this is true. And it goes on. Great caller. Dems already saying
[1:11:41.240 --> 1:11:45.800]  Mueller sold out. Yeah, let's go to Preston here about that. We'll go to Chase and then
[1:11:45.800 --> 1:11:51.880]  to Pastor Sam Preston. Yeah, I've got the articles right here. They've got Joy Reid.
[1:11:51.880 --> 1:11:59.680]  They're saying that Mueller sold out a Mueller. That's pretty hilarious. Yeah, that's what
[1:11:59.680 --> 1:12:03.800]  I'm seeing in the news. That's what everything looks to be. And I just wanted to make the
[1:12:03.800 --> 1:12:08.800]  point that we need to make sure as Trump supporters that we don't rush to defend Mueller against
[1:12:08.800 --> 1:12:12.960]  the Democrats character assassination campaign that's already underway. Just let them eat
[1:12:12.960 --> 1:12:18.360]  Mueller up. Let him keep going dead more wide on Mueller. Kind of like the Dems. Whenever
[1:12:18.360 --> 1:12:22.280]  he told me it was fired, they immediately fell in love with him. But we just said that
[1:12:22.280 --> 1:12:26.760]  with the last caller. I've noticed conservatives and people, we don't throw each other overboard
[1:12:26.760 --> 1:12:31.280]  unless somebody really deserves it and ask for it. They love to throw each other overboard.
[1:12:31.280 --> 1:12:36.280]  It's their big weakness. And you're absolutely right that that's what Trump's saying. He's
[1:12:36.280 --> 1:12:40.880]  saying it's criminal. It's a joke that it's all a fraud. And it was the biggest criminal
[1:12:40.880 --> 1:12:44.960]  which shot in history, which is true. He's not kissing Mueller's. But now that now the
[1:12:44.960 --> 1:12:50.680]  truth has come out. Yeah. And what the Dems are doing to their voters and constituents
[1:12:50.680 --> 1:12:56.280]  because Mueller and Comey are registered Republicans on paper. They're basically controlled opposition.
[1:12:56.280 --> 1:13:01.680]  Rhinos, Republicans and name. But they both said they were over Hillary. Yeah, exactly.
[1:13:01.680 --> 1:13:06.160]  Exactly. And Ben Shapiro said he'd rather have Hillary as president than, you know,
[1:13:06.160 --> 1:13:10.680]  Trump. So, but they're going to sell the false left, right paradigm to their voters as if
[1:13:10.680 --> 1:13:14.120]  the establishments on both sides don't hate Trump and they don't work together behind
[1:13:14.120 --> 1:13:20.680]  the scenes. It's two front doors to the slaughterhouse, but they will convince their constituents
[1:13:20.680 --> 1:13:25.960]  that there's some vast Republican conspiracy, even though Comey and Mueller couldn't be any
[1:13:25.960 --> 1:13:30.240]  less Republican than if they are. No, I agree. So obviously we know what comes next. They
[1:13:30.240 --> 1:13:35.120]  use the illegal wiretaps in the Mueller investigation to drag net and find dirt. But because they
[1:13:35.120 --> 1:13:38.600]  didn't find it, they would have already launched more of these investigations. They keep saying
[1:13:38.600 --> 1:13:42.120]  it's coming. I think you'll see a few Southern District in New York. You'll see some stuff
[1:13:42.120 --> 1:13:47.680]  in Chicago, but I just, they came up empty. I mean, Trump's not running scams for the
[1:13:47.680 --> 1:13:52.040]  mere fact that that's how people get control of you is running scams.
[1:13:52.040 --> 1:13:56.920]  Yeah, I can't even believe that they were able to go through everything that they did
[1:13:56.920 --> 1:14:02.440]  with Trump and not find a crooked toenail, not find something messed up on taxes or something
[1:14:02.440 --> 1:14:07.680]  to get him. It's really unbelievable. I would have, you know, that pretty much everything
[1:14:07.680 --> 1:14:12.720]  I had, they would have found something that was illegal or something that was, you know,
[1:14:12.720 --> 1:14:15.920]  against the fray. They can't because it's all standard operating procedure. It's like
[1:14:15.920 --> 1:14:20.040]  when the New York Times published 50 year old tax returns saying, from the time his
[1:14:20.040 --> 1:14:24.520]  children were young, every year the father put money into trust funds. That's what rich
[1:14:24.520 --> 1:14:30.080]  people have done for 100 years. It's standard. I mean, that's all you've got. Oh, wow. He
[1:14:30.080 --> 1:14:35.720]  avoided taxes legally. What do you do? Yeah, that's what you're supposed to do. And I mean,
[1:14:35.720 --> 1:14:40.520]  he got a million dollar loan from his father and turned it into 10 billion or whatever
[1:14:40.520 --> 1:14:45.640]  it is. He increased his original loan by 10,000 times, but he's, he's either somewhat
[1:14:45.640 --> 1:14:53.360]  dyke idiot who can't run the country or he's some super genius, you know, evil person that
[1:14:53.360 --> 1:14:57.680]  was able to sneak past the NSA and the DOJ and everybody else.
[1:14:57.680 --> 1:15:01.840]  I know what the truth is. Trump's a hard hitting pragmatist who just common sense looks at
[1:15:01.840 --> 1:15:06.520]  things and doesn't do it on a Machiavellian weirdo scale. He just shoots it straight.
[1:15:06.520 --> 1:15:09.760]  And that's why they keep thinking it's a, you know, 10th dimension chess. It's not.
[1:15:09.760 --> 1:15:13.040]  It's just looking at things like what's fair and what's real. I can tell you, you know,
[1:15:13.040 --> 1:15:16.720]  the secret, you know, about Trump, why he doesn't want his tax returns released. It's
[1:15:16.720 --> 1:15:20.880]  because he isn't like Googling people who pay zero tax, but he does diversify it into
[1:15:20.880 --> 1:15:25.160]  new companies, new businesses to keep it low or you could never run a business. And the
[1:15:25.160 --> 1:15:28.680]  truth is, is that he doesn't have that much money on paper because it's all in the companies
[1:15:28.680 --> 1:15:35.440]  and his family. But the family's got about, where it is about a hundred billion. So he's
[1:15:35.440 --> 1:15:39.120]  a lot richer than they even say. And compared to the big banks and Google, he pays a lot
[1:15:39.120 --> 1:15:43.160]  more taxes. But, you know, they think he'll be like, he's not worked that much once they
[1:15:43.160 --> 1:15:48.400]  get him. Well, yeah, no kidding. All the real rich people don't have money on paper. Hey,
[1:15:48.400 --> 1:15:52.680]  God bless you. Great points, Preston. We'll be right back with more calls straight ahead

[1:20:01.040 --> 1:20:21.680]  listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:21.680 --> 1:20:33.760]  We won't ride back to your phone calls, but I thought I'd play Bitoeroric yesterday morning
[1:20:33.760 --> 1:20:38.560]  after it had come out that there's no rush of collusion, nothing found, thousands of people
[1:20:38.560 --> 1:20:46.240]  interviewed, hundreds and hundreds of subpoenas, excuse me, 2,800 subpoenas. I was thinking 200
[1:20:46.240 --> 1:20:50.880]  subpoenas. I went no, no, it's 2,800 subpoenas. People always accuse me of rounding up. I tend
[1:20:50.880 --> 1:21:00.080]  to round down. Nothing because there wasn't any. The Russians are small-time players in
[1:21:00.080 --> 1:21:06.000]  geopolitical manipulation. They're big players in raw energy, raw material. The Chinese are the
[1:21:06.000 --> 1:21:10.880]  ones that basically have already taken the country over. Trump's just trying to get control back.
[1:21:12.720 --> 1:21:16.640]  And finally, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Secretary of Defense are saying that because it's
[1:21:16.640 --> 1:21:27.200]  a fact. I was sold 15 years ago in Hollywood by top people that China already owned controlling shares
[1:21:28.080 --> 1:21:33.680]  in half of the production companies. It's six of the eight now. They run it.
[1:21:33.680 --> 1:21:43.200]  And Google is helping them. Yeah, it's crazy.
[1:21:45.440 --> 1:21:49.360]  My subconscious brain sometimes gets mad at me because it's smarter, obviously,
[1:21:49.360 --> 1:21:53.360]  than the conscious brain hundreds of times. I had a dream about Jeff Bezos last week
[1:21:54.800 --> 1:21:58.400]  because I had like these dreams of power points and speeches I'm doing. I like work
[1:21:58.400 --> 1:22:02.960]  during my dreams and that's my best work time. And in my dream, I'm sitting there talking to Jeff
[1:22:02.960 --> 1:22:10.400]  Bezos and just like I ship stuff in from all over the world and have millions of employees
[1:22:10.400 --> 1:22:15.760]  here in the U.S. And you say I'm the worst big tech giant. I'm not selling slave goods in China.
[1:22:15.760 --> 1:22:21.200]  I don't run death camps in China. I'm not like Apple that is helping round up the political
[1:22:21.200 --> 1:22:26.960]  dissidents and put their iCloud keys over there. And I'm not like Google helping them run Dragonfly
[1:22:26.960 --> 1:22:32.400]  and surveil their people. I'm fighting Alibaba in China. It's a weird dream. And the weird thing is
[1:22:32.400 --> 1:22:41.440]  you wake up from that dream and you're like, why am I going after Jeff Bezos when literally of all
[1:22:41.440 --> 1:22:47.520]  the tech heads, he's the worst. He's the least of the worst. He's the lesser of the corruption.
[1:22:48.480 --> 1:22:53.040]  And this is some defense of Jeff Bezos and all the stuff that goes on at Amazon and all the
[1:22:54.000 --> 1:22:58.800]  employees and the rest of it. It was just sitting back and thinking about orders of magnitude,
[1:22:58.800 --> 1:23:04.880]  what Google and Apple are doing in China versus what Amazon's doing. And it's just my subconscious
[1:23:04.880 --> 1:23:12.400]  brain, even in a dream, is like going, Alex, this, he's not the target. Because let me tell you
[1:23:12.400 --> 1:23:17.680]  something. You could give the head of Google 50 years in prison for selling us out to China and
[1:23:17.680 --> 1:23:23.680]  giving them the AI. Bezos is working with the U.S. military. You could go after Apple for what they've
[1:23:23.680 --> 1:23:29.440]  done in China and arrest Tim Cook. And I'm not even saying do that. But my God, it's just the order
[1:23:29.440 --> 1:23:35.120]  of magnitude of treason is unbelievable about these people. And it was kind of an epiphany.
[1:23:36.880 --> 1:23:40.000]  Don't know why I just threw that out there. Just hit me the other night, had a dream about it.
[1:23:40.000 --> 1:23:43.680]  I'm telling you about it. Okay, we're going to go back to your calls. I have that big news on the
[1:23:43.680 --> 1:23:49.360]  SPLC that I'm going to cover during the last segment and then get to Greg Reese's powerful report.
[1:23:49.360 --> 1:23:53.920]  But a lot of things are happening to the establishment groups that are promoting racism
[1:23:53.920 --> 1:23:58.080]  and division in this country and they're fighting it. And they've got up to a billion dollars offshore.
[1:23:58.640 --> 1:24:03.120]  They're tied into foreign intelligence agencies. I'm going to give you the inside scoop on the SPLC
[1:24:04.080 --> 1:24:09.200]  and their employees and all the documented racism, sexism, sexual abuse. But that was their
[1:24:09.200 --> 1:24:14.080]  specialty 30 years ago. It came out in Morris Deez's divorce. All the stuff that was going on
[1:24:14.080 --> 1:24:19.120]  with his wife didn't want to do in those hotel rooms. Let's talk to who's up next here. I'm
[1:24:19.120 --> 1:24:23.360]  going to get everybody to start one of these calls. Pastor Sam in Texas, thanks for holding
[1:24:23.360 --> 1:24:33.040]  your own here. Hey, Alex. Yes, Trump is a genius. And I met with a lot of Republicans, really the
[1:24:33.040 --> 1:24:37.920]  whole Republican core of Texas over the weekend at two different meetings. A lot of great heroes.
[1:24:37.920 --> 1:24:42.400]  There was a lot of talk there. These were the, these are the people that we support and that
[1:24:42.400 --> 1:24:48.000]  support us. But Trump got out ahead of Mueller. He got out ahead of him and pushed upon in the
[1:24:48.000 --> 1:24:56.720]  center of the board by bringing up McCain. This is a real hot button because, for example, Dan
[1:24:56.720 --> 1:25:04.800]  Crenshaw, Navy SEAL, Texas congressman, he's really sore about this. He's served in the military.
[1:25:04.800 --> 1:25:10.400]  He's a war hero. He lost his eye on the battlefield. He's one of the few congressmen that is in
[1:25:10.400 --> 1:25:16.640]  favor as I am of intervention in Venezuela. He's ticked off about this. Joni's ticked off about
[1:25:16.640 --> 1:25:23.120]  it too. But here's the thing, Alex, you have pushed the real issue out front that there's
[1:25:23.120 --> 1:25:30.400]  devil worship behind all this. Joni just admitted she stood up for all the USA gymnastics girls
[1:25:30.400 --> 1:25:38.720]  valiantly. Joni just admitted in 2019 that she herself is a rape victim, that she was raped
[1:25:38.720 --> 1:25:46.880]  in college. And so now the question is, how much does rape, child rape, child sacrifice
[1:25:46.880 --> 1:25:52.560]  control the world? And are we going to face that or not? And I would really like to see
[1:25:52.560 --> 1:25:55.920]  all of the Republican Congress come out strong, strong.
[1:25:55.920 --> 1:25:59.680]  No, no, I hear you and I appreciate your call. Well, Trump's coming out against this post-birth abortion,
[1:25:59.680 --> 1:26:04.720]  partial birth abortion, and that's good. You know, John McCain can hide behind his military service.
[1:26:04.720 --> 1:26:10.400]  He was part of the Keating 5, was part of working with ISIS in Al Qaeda, and just all sorts of
[1:26:10.400 --> 1:26:16.320]  anti-gun, open border stuff. So, you know, this is that giant month-long worship when he died,
[1:26:16.320 --> 1:26:20.800]  like Herbert Walker Bush. I just think a lot of these well-meaning conservatives buy into
[1:26:20.800 --> 1:26:25.040]  mainstream media hype. And a lot of that's because they're so old. They're not bad, they're old, but
[1:26:25.760 --> 1:26:29.120]  that's not where the world's going. But I appreciate your call. Good point.
[1:26:29.120 --> 1:26:35.760]  Okay, who's up next here? Heather in New York. You're on the air. Welcome.
[1:26:37.840 --> 1:26:40.880]  Hi, Alex. Can you hear me? Yes, go ahead.
[1:26:42.000 --> 1:26:48.880]  Hi. Well, you know, I just wanted to say that I'm a long-time listener. I'm a big fan of you.
[1:26:49.840 --> 1:26:55.440]  You know, like I'm in New York. I hate New York. I think New York's gotten even worse than
[1:26:55.440 --> 1:27:01.840]  California, if you ask me, with it, the blah, and everything else. Take away our rights and
[1:27:01.840 --> 1:27:08.560]  everything else. It's so liberal, disgusting. But, you know, I do agree with everything that
[1:27:08.560 --> 1:27:14.000]  you're saying. And I think that it's total corruption. It's just total corruption. I mean,
[1:27:14.000 --> 1:27:18.960]  I think that I don't even know if there is any Republicans left. You know what I mean? I think
[1:27:18.960 --> 1:27:22.960]  they're like... Well, if you're up in New York, I can understand why you think that. But Trump has
[1:27:22.960 --> 1:27:28.560]  said greatest witch-hunting history. He's tweeted. It's his latest tweets. I have them. I can't find
[1:27:28.560 --> 1:27:33.280]  the stack. He came out and said, you know, it's a huge... There it is. Trump celebrates the Mueller
[1:27:33.280 --> 1:27:38.640]  findings. This was an illegal takedown that failed. That's what it is. And the crew's asking,
[1:27:38.640 --> 1:27:42.800]  what about lock her up? What about going after Mueller? What about going after Strach? What about
[1:27:42.800 --> 1:27:48.240]  going after Page? What about going after McCabe? And they're the ones that commit all the crimes.
[1:27:48.240 --> 1:27:53.440]  And the word is, it's confirmed. There are grand juries open and looking at it all.
[1:27:54.400 --> 1:27:58.960]  And so I think Trump has to go down that path because, sure, let them sell off in the sun
[1:27:58.960 --> 1:28:03.920]  instead of they left America alone. That deep state's not going to quit unless we bring them
[1:28:03.920 --> 1:28:09.840]  to justice. Remember what Trump said? Now that the Russia collusion is over, can we go after the
[1:28:09.840 --> 1:28:13.920]  real crimes of the deep state? You guys put that tweet, the president put out a few months ago,
[1:28:13.920 --> 1:28:18.480]  back up on screen please, because I want TV viewers to be able to see that. Now that Russian
[1:28:18.480 --> 1:28:23.680]  collusion is a proven lie, when do the trials for treason begin? Thank you so much, Heather.
[1:28:23.680 --> 1:28:29.120]  You're asking when does Mueller not get away scot-free? Well, I don't want to have a war with
[1:28:29.120 --> 1:28:33.680]  these people, but they won't stop. They won't even join Trump in America and stand up to the
[1:28:33.680 --> 1:28:40.640]  chai comms and come in for the big win because they're trained from birth spiritually to hate
[1:28:40.640 --> 1:28:45.280]  this country and to believe, as the earlier collars said, they have a right to rule it.
[1:28:45.840 --> 1:28:52.320]  Like a baby duck imprints on its mother. They've imprinted on evil and hurting us. They can't change
[1:28:52.320 --> 1:29:02.880]  their spots. Getting your protein has never been easier with InfoWars Life Protein Bars.

[1:31:57.920 --> 1:32:01.520]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine,
[1:32:01.520 --> 1:32:05.520]  introducing pollen block. We have found an extraordinary new,
[1:32:05.520 --> 1:32:10.720]  natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal
[1:32:10.720 --> 1:32:18.160]  and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory function. In the 1960s, researchers in France
[1:32:18.160 --> 1:32:23.520]  noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory
[1:32:23.520 --> 1:32:29.120]  responses. They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later, we now have
[1:32:29.120 --> 1:32:34.720]  the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress
[1:32:34.720 --> 1:32:40.720]  symptoms. Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine. In fact, current
[1:32:40.720 --> 1:32:45.440]  research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase, which is an
[1:32:45.440 --> 1:32:51.360]  enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body. Go outside and enjoy the
[1:32:51.360 --> 1:32:57.360]  air you breathe. Head to InfoWarsLife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.

[1:34:19.760 --> 1:34:24.640]  and I've got a bunch I need to cover in the last segment as well. So let's go quickly through your
[1:34:24.640 --> 1:34:31.360]  great calls. Let's go ahead and talk to Chase the Patriot from California. You're on the air, go ahead.
[1:34:32.720 --> 1:34:37.040]  Alex, thank you so much for taking my call. Yes, Chase the Patriot frontlines on YouTube,
[1:34:37.040 --> 1:34:41.600]  brother, and I got three big points here that I'm putting together an episode for.
[1:34:41.600 --> 1:34:46.720]  You know, with President Trump and the Ebola report coming out, it's a big win for him. So what's
[1:34:46.720 --> 1:34:51.280]  going to be the counterattack from the deep state? The second one is the Democrats and all their
[1:34:51.280 --> 1:34:55.920]  investigations in the House of Representatives, all that is is the drag on to the next election
[1:34:55.920 --> 1:35:00.960]  cycle. And then third and most important, when I saw your clip in the restaurant,
[1:35:00.960 --> 1:35:06.960]  those people attacking you, that reminds me here in California of all the closet Trump supporters,
[1:35:06.960 --> 1:35:11.600]  they don't wear the MAGA hat. They don't put a bumper sticker on because they know that they
[1:35:11.600 --> 1:35:16.640]  will actually get attacked by the crazy leftist loon. But, you know, we try to compose ourselves
[1:35:16.640 --> 1:35:21.040]  and we support the president and you better believe they'll go in and vote when it comes election time.
[1:35:22.640 --> 1:35:26.720]  Chase, thank you. Great point. And I think you're right that we're in danger of them staging a
[1:35:26.720 --> 1:35:32.640]  false flag. What type of false flag do you think they might stage? Well, you know, the thing that
[1:35:32.640 --> 1:35:38.320]  it's like in New Zealand, it's probably going to do something with a second amendment because
[1:35:38.320 --> 1:35:42.400]  they're already attacking our first amendment, right? And it's only, you know, second amendment
[1:35:42.400 --> 1:35:47.040]  is on their targets as well. Well, I got to say this, you know, I know they're real crazies on
[1:35:47.040 --> 1:35:53.680]  all sides, Muslim extremists, white supremacists, whatever. So I'm like, okay, God goes in, he kills,
[1:35:53.680 --> 1:35:57.280]  manifesto, I don't agree with it, but you know, it looks like it's a real crazy. And then the way
[1:35:57.280 --> 1:36:01.280]  you can't question it, and then the way they said that I said it didn't happen, and the way they
[1:36:01.280 --> 1:36:05.840]  won't let you show the manifesto or the video, but they can show it. And now all the censorship
[1:36:05.840 --> 1:36:10.720]  and URLs being blocked in New Zealand and all this stuff, now it's very suspicious. I don't know
[1:36:10.720 --> 1:36:15.680]  what's going on, but it's like when they banned us on YouTube back last February, not this February,
[1:36:15.680 --> 1:36:22.240]  last February, 20, I don't know, 14 months ago, we had local people saying the police stood down
[1:36:22.880 --> 1:36:28.000]  on video. And then they said, Joan says no one dies. Then later it turned down, turned out the
[1:36:28.000 --> 1:36:32.560]  cop stood down. So a lot of times when they're saying don't question it, it's because it's not
[1:36:32.560 --> 1:36:36.880]  that it didn't happen, there's something they're covering up, I appreciate your call. They're acting
[1:36:36.880 --> 1:36:42.880]  very, very, very, very, very, very suspicious. And since when are we not supposed to look into
[1:36:42.880 --> 1:36:47.840]  vaccines or look into drugs that are on the market or look into a big public event? Everybody
[1:36:47.840 --> 1:36:51.760]  always questions big public events. There are all sorts of conspiracy theories about
[1:36:51.760 --> 1:37:00.400]  OJ Simpson. They used one to get him off. Turns out it was probably false. He probably did it.
[1:37:02.240 --> 1:37:07.280]  But there's some evidence the police were trying to frame OJ because they thought he was guilty.
[1:37:08.320 --> 1:37:11.520]  So he got off. That's the American system.
[1:37:11.520 --> 1:37:18.880]  Imagine today you're not supposed to question OJ did it. We're told OJ did it, OJ did it.
[1:37:21.680 --> 1:37:24.080]  That makes sense, does it? Thank you so much for the call, Chase.
[1:37:25.920 --> 1:37:29.920]  Let's talk to Matthew in South Carolina about the Mueller report and what he thinks is coming next.
[1:37:29.920 --> 1:37:30.640]  Go ahead, Matthew.
[1:37:33.920 --> 1:37:34.720]  Hey, Alex.
[1:37:34.720 --> 1:37:35.120]  Yes, sir.
[1:37:36.640 --> 1:37:40.240]  Hey, it's actually South Georgia. It's not South Carolina.
[1:37:40.240 --> 1:37:41.600]  I'm sorry. I read that wrong.
[1:37:42.800 --> 1:37:48.240]  That's fine, man. It's an honor to be on the show, man. Hey, I learned about you at a Trump rally,
[1:37:48.240 --> 1:37:58.080]  man. Back in 2016, I saw all the info wars shirts and I put two and two together. I remember here
[1:37:58.080 --> 1:38:03.360]  and Hillary mentioned something about it. So I went and checked it out. It was probably 25 to 30%
[1:38:03.360 --> 1:38:16.960]  of info wars shirts out there. And I just want to say, man, the majority of that 25 to 30% was
[1:38:18.480 --> 1:38:27.600]  young college kids. He did the rally near college. And those college kids, they don't want to listen
[1:38:27.600 --> 1:38:34.320]  to Donna Brazil, Shepard Smith, Juan William. These college kids are learning and they want
[1:38:34.320 --> 1:38:40.000]  to hear from Owen Sawyer and David Knight, Alex Jones, Paul Joseph Watson, Mark Dice.
[1:38:40.000 --> 1:38:44.160]  These are the people that we want to hear from. We don't want to hear from this establishment.
[1:38:44.720 --> 1:38:53.520]  Fake news. I'm sick of it. I am sick. I'm putting boots on the crown. I got a chip tooth from these
[1:38:53.520 --> 1:39:00.000]  people, these scum demons that want to ruin our country. They want to turn it into communist China.
[1:39:00.560 --> 1:39:03.760]  And this is what's gonna happen to you. Were you attacked? Were you attacked by leftists?
[1:39:04.640 --> 1:39:09.680]  I was attacked by leftists at a Trump rally. We had to park like four or five miles away.
[1:39:10.800 --> 1:39:17.280]  And on the walk there, Antifa, and there was this truck going by and it said, Brian Kemp. And then
[1:39:17.280 --> 1:39:28.240]  it said, it was like comparing Brian Kemp to Jim Crow. Well, let me break this down for you.
[1:39:28.240 --> 1:39:33.440]  Let me break this down for you. Why do you think the left and Hillary came after me?
[1:39:34.160 --> 1:39:38.720]  They had ignored info wars and then all the Trump rallies, like you said, about 20 to 30% of the
[1:39:38.720 --> 1:39:43.920]  shirts were lock her up info wars.com. So then they went and looked at our numbers and went, my
[1:39:43.920 --> 1:39:48.800]  God, I mean, before they censored us back then, it was like 50 million extra viewers a week,
[1:39:49.360 --> 1:39:54.240]  conservatively election week, 80 something million. And then they went, Oh, my God,
[1:39:54.240 --> 1:39:59.920]  we got to destroy this guy. He's relaunched the grassroots anti globalist movement. No,
[1:39:59.920 --> 1:40:05.200]  I was just a person that saw it and was involved in it. The focal point trying to shut me down
[1:40:05.200 --> 1:40:09.520]  does nothing. It only makes it get stronger. So the point you make is great. That's why we need
[1:40:09.520 --> 1:40:16.400]  the next viral T shirts at public events so that when Democrats and others see that, they know
[1:40:17.920 --> 1:40:21.920]  that they're going to lose. And so that's very exciting. Matthew, thank you so much for the call.
[1:40:23.120 --> 1:40:27.200]  You know, I've got Chad, Virginia, Jim, Mike, David and Greg. And I said, I'm getting every call,
[1:40:27.200 --> 1:40:31.840]  but I've got to get to the great stuff happened at the Southern primary law centers. They've been
[1:40:32.640 --> 1:40:36.080]  caught red handed. They're imploding. We've also got this Greg Reese report, but let's
[1:40:36.080 --> 1:40:41.680]  let's get one more caller in before we go to break here. Greg wants to make fun of Mueller.
[1:40:41.680 --> 1:40:46.160]  Now the criminals are going to get what they deserve. David, who's been holding the longest
[1:40:46.160 --> 1:40:52.960]  year? That'd be David in New York. David, thanks for holding. What is your take on that? You think
[1:40:52.960 --> 1:40:57.280]  they're going to get what they deserve now? Great job, Alex. Great show today. A lot of great points.
[1:40:57.280 --> 1:41:00.880]  I'd like to say, Alex, that what I think is going to happen is you're going to see a reverse
[1:41:00.880 --> 1:41:07.760]  engineering of the two years of the slow, but terrible process we had to endure of trying
[1:41:07.760 --> 1:41:13.280]  to wear the Trump people out in our great president. Now, even today, our great president said,
[1:41:13.280 --> 1:41:18.080]  Hey, maybe we're going to start looking into the other side of this. And slowly with Shirley
[1:41:18.080 --> 1:41:23.440]  Alex, we're going to see Comey. We're going to see McCabe and all these creeps. And I hope
[1:41:23.440 --> 1:41:27.680]  even Obama and Clinton slowly, but surely come under the great hand of justice of this great
[1:41:27.680 --> 1:41:33.440]  country and turn this thing around and bring us back into control because we should have it because
[1:41:33.440 --> 1:41:38.240]  we're in the right and we want to do the right thing. Keep up the great work, Alex. I'm starting
[1:41:38.240 --> 1:41:42.480]  to get excited again. Well, David, don't hang up because you're making great points. Trump knows
[1:41:42.480 --> 1:41:47.520]  that this evil is so out of control and so embedded. We have to go after it or it's just going to come
[1:41:47.520 --> 1:41:52.400]  back. And they're not going to make deals to back off. Their religion is destroying America.
[1:41:52.400 --> 1:41:56.320]  And I agree with him going after censorship on Friday and the statements he's making,
[1:41:56.320 --> 1:42:01.040]  they're scared and spiritually leftists are linked up. It's demonic. It's low level,
[1:42:01.040 --> 1:42:05.680]  but they're linked up. They are running around like chickens with their heads cut off right now.
[1:42:06.320 --> 1:42:10.320]  Absolutely, Alex. When you stand up to bully, just like your last call, you look the bully in the
[1:42:10.320 --> 1:42:15.520]  eye and he takes his best shot. And then you respond, then you keep going after them. That's
[1:42:15.520 --> 1:42:19.520]  exactly what we're going to do. And the president's going to do that. And this new attorney general,
[1:42:19.520 --> 1:42:25.120]  I have faith in our country again. And it's exciting. Take them on. Look, you can't back down
[1:42:25.120 --> 1:42:30.320]  now, Mr. President. We got to take them down. Like you said so well in many of your shows and your
[1:42:30.320 --> 1:42:34.880]  people, are they going to take us out? You know, we got to take them out. We got to take them out
[1:42:34.880 --> 1:42:39.440]  legally the right way. Take them out through the system that they tried to take our great president
[1:42:39.440 --> 1:42:45.040]  down. Just flip it. And let's remember, they've been given two plus years and failed. And that's why
[1:42:45.040 --> 1:42:49.040]  they're getting dumped right now. You're right. This is a very exciting time, David. Thank you.
[1:42:50.560 --> 1:42:53.440]  I said I get the calls. We're just going to come back with the calls. I'll get those reports
[1:42:53.440 --> 1:43:01.760]  tomorrow. Stay with us. The globalist, the eugenicist are always talking down to us.
[1:43:02.480 --> 1:43:08.160]  They're always trying to make us feel small to feel insignificant. They try to censor
[1:43:08.160 --> 1:43:12.400]  because they fear you and don't want you to have the right to access information
[1:43:12.400 --> 1:43:18.560]  so you can make your own decisions. They want you to believe you're powerless. But the truth is,
[1:43:18.560 --> 1:43:25.200]  it is we the people and our ideas and our actions and what we say and what we do that changes the
[1:43:25.200 --> 1:43:31.920]  world. We are the power structure. We are the inventors. We are the trailblazers. And the globalists
[1:43:33.200 --> 1:43:39.200]  understand that. And they understand that they are basically trying to control and steal the
[1:43:39.200 --> 1:43:44.320]  future from we the people. Now, to help fund our operation that is undoubtedly the very tip of
[1:43:44.320 --> 1:43:48.960]  the spear against these globalists. I want to encourage listeners and viewers to understand

[1:47:28.240 --> 1:47:33.240]  We're live ten hours a day here on the InfoWarsNet, working soon, even more new shows set to be announced soon.
[1:47:33.240 --> 1:47:40.240]  We're about a year behind, we've been held back by Global's Attacks, but we're still expanding in the face of it.
[1:47:40.240 --> 1:47:45.240]  I want to go to Chad, Virginia, Jim, Mike and Greg.
[1:47:45.240 --> 1:47:53.240]  Greg Reese just filed a very powerful report about why can't anybody question or even investigate the New Zealand shooting.
[1:47:53.240 --> 1:47:56.240]  Why is it so unprecedented?
[1:47:56.240 --> 1:48:00.240]  Christchurch used a silence questioning on global scale.
[1:48:00.240 --> 1:48:04.240]  Very important report will air it tomorrow during the weekday show.
[1:48:04.240 --> 1:48:07.240]  I hope David Knight airs it too, it's powerful.
[1:48:07.240 --> 1:48:12.240]  And I promise I'm going to start the show off tomorrow unless there's some huge event with SPLC implodes.
[1:48:12.240 --> 1:48:16.240]  President and legal director resigned amid sexual misconduct scandal.
[1:48:16.240 --> 1:48:19.240]  Folks, they've got up to a billion bucks offshore.
[1:48:19.240 --> 1:48:21.240]  First was 500 million, they found even more.
[1:48:21.240 --> 1:48:27.240]  And they're just there to say everything under the sun's racist, but they themselves are horrible people and working with a globalist.
[1:48:27.240 --> 1:48:32.240]  And the fact that they're in so much trouble, the word is media matters is next.
[1:48:32.240 --> 1:48:35.240]  Soros, you notice, came out two weeks ago and said, OK, China's the threat.
[1:48:35.240 --> 1:48:37.240]  Let's leave Trump alone.
[1:48:37.240 --> 1:48:39.240]  They get the riding on the wall.
[1:48:39.240 --> 1:48:41.240]  They're losing, we're winning.
[1:48:41.240 --> 1:48:43.240]  That's a big deal.
[1:48:43.240 --> 1:48:45.240]  And that's a big takeaway.
[1:48:45.240 --> 1:48:53.240]  So your prayers, you're spreading the word of newswords.com, infowords.com, the videos, the articles, via email, via text,
[1:48:53.240 --> 1:48:57.240]  thanking local stations, supporting our sponsors.
[1:48:57.240 --> 1:48:59.240]  All of it is out of effect.
[1:48:59.240 --> 1:49:01.240]  You've done it.
[1:49:01.240 --> 1:49:08.240]  It's coming up for the free newsletter, infowords.com, for us newsletter, buying the products and infowordsstore.com.
[1:49:08.240 --> 1:49:10.240]  It's had a huge effect.
[1:49:10.240 --> 1:49:15.240]  And yeah, we are one of the most central systems here attacking the globalist.
[1:49:15.240 --> 1:49:19.240]  We're just a focal point, so I salute you and I thank you.
[1:49:19.240 --> 1:49:25.240]  Chad in Texas, you asked how long until Rosenstein resides?
[1:49:25.240 --> 1:49:27.240]  There's almost trouble.
[1:49:27.240 --> 1:49:28.240]  Hey, Alex, man.
[1:49:28.240 --> 1:49:30.240]  Thanks for being the vanguard in the fight, brother.
[1:49:30.240 --> 1:49:32.240]  Thank you.
[1:49:32.240 --> 1:49:39.240]  Now that Mueller's done, how long do you think it's going to be until Rosenstein's in the unemployment line?
[1:49:39.240 --> 1:49:46.240]  Well, you know, that's a question because does Trump leave them all alone so they don't struggle and fight against the country
[1:49:46.240 --> 1:49:47.240]  and just move forward?
[1:49:47.240 --> 1:49:56.240]  That's called giving people abstentia or kind of a reprieve or amnesty.
[1:49:56.240 --> 1:49:58.240]  Or do they keep coming back?
[1:49:58.240 --> 1:50:00.240]  And I don't think they can help but come back.
[1:50:00.240 --> 1:50:09.240]  Because they've committed so many crimes, the political interests that run them because they're just minions are going to keep pushing them.
[1:50:09.240 --> 1:50:11.240]  And so I don't think Trump has a choice.
[1:50:11.240 --> 1:50:12.240]  It's the right thing to do.
[1:50:12.240 --> 1:50:14.240]  Anyways, he's to prosecute him.
[1:50:14.240 --> 1:50:16.240]  Absolutely, brother.
[1:50:16.240 --> 1:50:17.240]  Absolutely.
[1:50:17.240 --> 1:50:18.240]  Thanks for taking McCulden.
[1:50:18.240 --> 1:50:19.240]  Amen.
[1:50:19.240 --> 1:50:20.240]  Thank you, Chad.
[1:50:20.240 --> 1:50:22.240]  Let's go ahead and talk to Virginia in California.
[1:50:22.240 --> 1:50:23.240]  Virginia, you're on the air.
[1:50:23.240 --> 1:50:24.240]  Thanks for holding.
[1:50:24.240 --> 1:50:30.240]  Hey, Alex, can you hear me?
[1:50:30.240 --> 1:50:31.240]  Yes, ma'am.
[1:50:31.240 --> 1:50:32.240]  Thanks for joining us.
[1:50:32.240 --> 1:50:35.240]  I wanted to say thank you for the vanilla coconut bars.
[1:50:35.240 --> 1:50:36.240]  Those are great.
[1:50:36.240 --> 1:50:46.240]  And I just wanted to say that we need to keep our eyes on France because God is going to send them a leader that's going to save them.
[1:50:46.240 --> 1:50:55.240]  And he's going to give a lot of consolation to President Trump.
[1:50:55.240 --> 1:51:00.240]  Let's just keep our eyes on France.
[1:51:00.240 --> 1:51:01.240]  Are you there?
[1:51:01.240 --> 1:51:02.240]  Yes, I'm there.
[1:51:02.240 --> 1:51:11.240]  You know, they asked Pompeo over in Israel a few days ago, CBN did, whether he thought Trump was risen up by God, he said probably.
[1:51:11.240 --> 1:51:14.240]  And then the media freaked out saying, oh, my God, we've got a cult running us.
[1:51:14.240 --> 1:51:19.240]  You know, God uses good people, bad people, people in between, but the left has their own God.
[1:51:19.240 --> 1:51:29.240]  So the idea that people are Christian and that they believe we pray and then God sends us people that'll be good leaders, that's what history shows.
[1:51:29.240 --> 1:51:31.240]  So I do appreciate your call, Virginia.
[1:51:31.240 --> 1:51:35.240]  What are your things coming next?
[1:51:35.240 --> 1:51:42.240]  I think that we're going to find out that France is going to kind of lead the world into peace.
[1:51:42.240 --> 1:51:46.240]  And then after that, you know, whatever.
[1:51:46.240 --> 1:51:51.240]  So anyway, all right.
[1:51:51.240 --> 1:51:52.240]  All right, well, I appreciate your call.
[1:51:52.240 --> 1:51:54.240]  Sounds like your phone's breaking up a little bit.
[1:51:54.240 --> 1:51:55.240]  Appreciate you.
[1:51:55.240 --> 1:51:57.240]  Jim in Texas, you're on the air.
[1:51:57.240 --> 1:51:58.240]  Welcome.
[1:51:58.240 --> 1:51:59.240]  God bless you, Alex.
[1:51:59.240 --> 1:52:01.240]  And God bless the crew.
[1:52:01.240 --> 1:52:05.240]  Man is so thankful to be part of the Info Warriors crew.
[1:52:05.240 --> 1:52:06.240]  I'm a monthly supporter.
[1:52:06.240 --> 1:52:12.240]  I'm hoping there's going to be a lot more people, especially after this 50 hour broadcast that will be monthly supporters.
[1:52:12.240 --> 1:52:14.240]  Just amazing time we're in.
[1:52:14.240 --> 1:52:15.240]  Absolutely.
[1:52:15.240 --> 1:52:23.240]  And people like things like our great coffee or toothpaste or fish oil or the protein bars, things you're going to want every month, every two months.
[1:52:23.240 --> 1:52:26.240]  Sign up for auto ship and additional 10% off.
[1:52:26.240 --> 1:52:28.240]  And that way it's a tithe and you get the product.
[1:52:28.240 --> 1:52:30.240]  You don't have to worry about it because I'm the same way.
[1:52:30.240 --> 1:52:35.240]  We came with auto ship like five years ago because I forget to get the coffee myself and go to the store.
[1:52:35.240 --> 1:52:36.240]  And I'm like, wait, I sell good coffee.
[1:52:36.240 --> 1:52:38.240]  Why not go into our own warehouse?
[1:52:38.240 --> 1:52:39.240]  So that's why we do that.
[1:52:39.240 --> 1:52:40.240]  So thank you.
[1:52:40.240 --> 1:52:41.240]  No, my wife says it's the best.
[1:52:41.240 --> 1:52:45.240]  I mean, she's gone to a lot of organic coffees and I keep bringing them home.
[1:52:45.240 --> 1:52:46.240]  So it's awesome.
[1:52:46.240 --> 1:52:51.240]  Joe Rogan's a big coffee addict and he was like, God, this is really good coffee.
[1:52:51.240 --> 1:52:53.240]  This is the amazing times we're in.
[1:52:53.240 --> 1:53:01.240]  It's sort of like the the chat blocks off of the semi on a big hill has been released because it's the Mueller report.
[1:53:01.240 --> 1:53:07.240]  So now I think our president can do what he wanted to do a long time ago, but it was hesitant.
[1:53:07.240 --> 1:53:14.240]  And rightly so, because you can't say that he's obstructing the investigation by doing anything.
[1:53:14.240 --> 1:53:19.240]  And now he can't be told that he's obstructing anything.
[1:53:19.240 --> 1:53:20.240]  No, I agree.
[1:53:20.240 --> 1:53:28.240]  But before the house launches dozens of other fake investigations, he's got to strike back now because they're telling him, sir, we're going to stop.
[1:53:28.240 --> 1:53:30.240]  We know you're not a bad guy.
[1:53:30.240 --> 1:53:32.240]  It's not going to stop.
[1:53:32.240 --> 1:53:33.240]  Absolutely.
[1:53:33.240 --> 1:53:40.240]  But now he can Alex because he had that fog over him that he couldn't go ahead and fire.
[1:53:40.240 --> 1:53:42.240]  By the way, I've always been spiritual.
[1:53:42.240 --> 1:53:53.240]  But if you look at how the left is connected like wirelessly, like bots, I don't know if you've if you see how not just on TV, but in person, the left is freaking out, which signifies to me.
[1:53:53.240 --> 1:53:55.240]  They're God knows they're in trouble.
[1:53:55.240 --> 1:53:56.240]  Absolutely.
[1:53:56.240 --> 1:54:00.240]  But so now we need to be more unified than them.
[1:54:00.240 --> 1:54:06.240]  If your lights go out in six months and we do our absolute best, I'll be knocking on your door.
[1:54:06.240 --> 1:54:07.240]  I'll be walking down the street.
[1:54:07.240 --> 1:54:13.240]  We'll still keep this fight going because this is a spiritual fight and God's been working in the background.
[1:54:13.240 --> 1:54:15.240]  You got to see that.
[1:54:15.240 --> 1:54:16.240]  You got to see.
[1:54:16.240 --> 1:54:17.240]  I know you know.
[1:54:17.240 --> 1:54:24.240]  A thousand percent know that we're going to see more because now the floodgates are open.
[1:54:24.240 --> 1:54:25.240]  Absolutely.
[1:54:25.240 --> 1:54:27.240]  And you know, you hang with the people that are hot.
[1:54:27.240 --> 1:54:30.240]  It's like colds in the middle of the fire.
[1:54:30.240 --> 1:54:31.240]  Keep it going.
[1:54:31.240 --> 1:54:34.240]  That little cold that goes off to the side kind of burns out.
[1:54:34.240 --> 1:54:42.240]  So we can't reach everybody, but we're going to red pill as many as we can and knowing that Americana is white.
[1:54:42.240 --> 1:54:44.240]  It's godly influence.
[1:54:44.240 --> 1:54:47.240]  It cannot be stopped by Islam or any other thing.
[1:54:47.240 --> 1:54:49.240]  And we are going to win this fight.
[1:54:49.240 --> 1:54:50.240]  Beautiful job.
[1:54:50.240 --> 1:54:52.240]  Thank you.
[1:54:52.240 --> 1:54:56.240]  Mike in North Carolina, Northern California, Mike in Northern California, then Greg.
[1:54:56.240 --> 1:54:58.240]  Go ahead, Mike.
[1:54:58.240 --> 1:55:00.240]  Hey, Alice, good to talk to you.
[1:55:00.240 --> 1:55:05.240]  Hey, listen, I'm just a simple logger up here in Northern California listening to all this.
[1:55:05.240 --> 1:55:09.240]  You know, I'm a former deputy sheriff on the United States Marine.
[1:55:09.240 --> 1:55:15.240]  I love the country, but I think what most people need to realize is not Democrat Republican.
[1:55:15.240 --> 1:55:16.240]  It's good and evil.
[1:55:16.240 --> 1:55:22.240]  It's about a fundamental change in the United States of America to change.
[1:55:22.240 --> 1:55:27.240]  I mean, what happens if every 10 years we get another, what is her name, Ian Omar?
[1:55:27.240 --> 1:55:33.240]  If they keep bringing people into our country, which I want all people to be here if you want to assimilate.
[1:55:33.240 --> 1:55:36.240]  Sure, but they're bringing people in that fundamentally are to conquer.
[1:55:36.240 --> 1:55:37.240]  Exactly.
[1:55:37.240 --> 1:55:38.240]  And that's what's good.
[1:55:38.240 --> 1:55:39.240]  Look at Minnesota.
[1:55:39.240 --> 1:55:40.240]  Okay.
[1:55:40.240 --> 1:55:41.240]  And now we have Omar.
[1:55:41.240 --> 1:55:45.240]  What's going to happen in five years in 10 years when they keep opening the floodgates?
[1:55:45.240 --> 1:55:51.240]  I hate to say it, but I mean, somebody, somebody needs to say it and somebody needs to do it
[1:55:51.240 --> 1:55:53.240]  and they need to get a handle on what's going on in this country.
[1:55:53.240 --> 1:55:57.240]  And when the muslims blow stuff up and shoot people, we don't say it's muslims.
[1:55:57.240 --> 1:56:01.240]  We go, oh, ISIS isn't muslims or this church being blown up isn't muslims.
[1:56:01.240 --> 1:56:04.240]  But then when muslims get killed, everybody goes, oh, we're all guilty.
[1:56:04.240 --> 1:56:05.240]  We're all wearing jibs.
[1:56:05.240 --> 1:56:07.240]  And I feel sorry for the muslims.
[1:56:07.240 --> 1:56:10.240]  I wanted to get out of that cult, but I hear what you're saying.
[1:56:10.240 --> 1:56:14.240]  And you were going to point out that real conservatives don't have a platform.
[1:56:14.240 --> 1:56:16.240]  They're shutting down people that don't back down.
[1:56:16.240 --> 1:56:17.240]  Mike, thank you.
[1:56:17.240 --> 1:56:20.240]  I'm taking on for five minutes, but I've got to get to the final caller.
[1:56:20.240 --> 1:56:25.240]  Greg in California, again, another Californian wants to make fun of Mueller.
[1:56:25.240 --> 1:56:26.240]  Go ahead, brother.
[1:56:26.240 --> 1:56:27.240]  You got about 70 seconds.
[1:56:27.240 --> 1:56:28.240]  Yeah.
[1:56:28.240 --> 1:56:29.240]  Oh, hello, Alex.
[1:56:29.240 --> 1:56:30.240]  How are you doing?
[1:56:30.240 --> 1:56:31.240]  I'm all right.
[1:56:31.240 --> 1:56:32.240]  I've been a listener since 2008.
[1:56:32.240 --> 1:56:35.240]  It's been about $6,000 since last April.
[1:56:35.240 --> 1:56:37.240]  And I'm going to be one for you.
[1:56:37.240 --> 1:56:40.240]  If it wasn't for you, Soros would have won, brother.
[1:56:40.240 --> 1:56:41.240]  Yeah.
[1:56:41.240 --> 1:56:42.240]  You know what?
[1:56:42.240 --> 1:56:43.240]  Well, never mind.
[1:56:43.240 --> 1:56:44.240]  You know what?
[1:56:44.240 --> 1:56:48.240]  I wrote the president yesterday.
[1:56:48.240 --> 1:56:56.240]  I asked him, you know, for a campaign gimmick fundraiser, Mueller report toilet paper.
[1:56:56.240 --> 1:57:06.240]  So I went, looked at custom toilet paper printing in a company called pro paper products.com.
[1:57:06.240 --> 1:57:10.240]  And I think they look a little patriotic.
[1:57:10.240 --> 1:57:13.240]  So I think those guys might accept that.
[1:57:13.240 --> 1:57:14.240]  That's pretty funny.
[1:57:14.240 --> 1:57:16.240]  I just think we should put Hillary's face on there.
[1:57:16.240 --> 1:57:19.240]  Mueller that the left buildup is God as he was going to destroy Trump.
[1:57:19.240 --> 1:57:22.240]  Now he's just, he's gone because they're all no bodies.
[1:57:22.240 --> 1:57:24.240]  Their whole investigation was a fraud.
[1:57:24.240 --> 1:57:25.240]  It was run by globalist.
[1:57:25.240 --> 1:57:27.240]  It was all based on lies.
[1:57:27.240 --> 1:57:30.240]  And it just shows how pathetic they are, my friend.
[1:57:30.240 --> 1:57:33.240]  And a couple more t-shirts that you might think about doing.
[1:57:33.240 --> 1:57:37.240]  You guys can write this down.
[1:57:37.240 --> 1:57:43.240]  Pardon me, butthole, you know, Beto, butthole t-shirt and it has a bull.
[1:57:43.240 --> 1:57:44.240]  We're out of time, brother.
[1:57:44.240 --> 1:57:45.240]  I'll be back tomorrow at 11.
[1:57:45.240 --> 1:57:48.240]  I love you.
[1:57:48.240 --> 1:57:51.240]  There are thousands of ideologies out there.
[1:57:51.240 --> 1:57:53.240]  Hundreds of different political systems.
[1:57:53.240 --> 1:57:56.240]  And most of them are funded by the globalist.
[1:57:56.240 --> 1:57:59.240]  Info wars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist.
[1:57:59.240 --> 1:58:02.240]  That's why the globalists are obsessed with it, trying to shut it down.
[1:58:02.240 --> 1:58:04.240]  I didn't invent all this.
[1:58:04.240 --> 1:58:08.240]  I researched the Renaissance, Americana and what really works for humanity.
[1:58:08.240 --> 1:58:10.240]  And I'm simply trying to bring it back.
[1:58:10.240 --> 1:58:14.240]  And lo and behold, it's super popular like it's always been.
[1:58:14.240 --> 1:58:17.240]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately.
[1:58:17.240 --> 1:58:20.240]  Because we have the light in the dark of the night.
[1:58:20.240 --> 1:58:22.240]  That sends chills at my spine.
[1:58:22.240 --> 1:58:25.240]  So whatever you do, continue to support yourself and info wars.
