[00:00.000 --> 00:29.000]  This is the Alex Jones show. In the driver's seat today for Alex, I am Owen Shroyer. We
[00:29.000 --> 00:33.960]  do have Alex over the phone. He's going to give us an update on the latest attack on
[00:33.960 --> 00:38.600]  info wars. Alex, what's going on? They're trying to censor us and shut us down. What
[00:38.600 --> 00:43.440]  are we dealing with now? Well, that's right. We've got amazingly positive news actually
[00:43.440 --> 00:48.320]  today. Just just incredibly positive news coming up the next segment. I'm only going
[00:48.320 --> 00:53.520]  to do two segments with you because you've got a full play today, but the developments,
[00:53.520 --> 00:57.360]  the head of the Trump campaign and really one of the key people in the White House right
[00:57.360 --> 01:02.880]  now way more important than Stephen Bannon ever was for my sources is Brad Parscale.
[01:02.880 --> 01:06.440]  You never hear about him because he's behind the scenes. He's a tech expert and all the
[01:06.440 --> 01:10.160]  rest of it who helped galvanize the American people through the internet to get around
[01:10.160 --> 01:16.440]  the globalist. He's come out on the record as the president and said that big tech we're
[01:16.440 --> 01:20.840]  watching you. If you don't want to get busted up for being monopolies, you better stop the
[01:20.840 --> 01:25.520]  censorship. So we're going to read his tweets, cover all that next segment. They're now
[01:25.520 --> 01:30.080]  saying if you talk about globalism, it's anti-Semitic. So I guess we're talking about freedom. They
[01:30.080 --> 01:33.560]  can just say the word freedom is anti-Semitic. We've been on that. We've got that coming
[01:33.560 --> 01:37.400]  up. This globalism just means a system of world government. The biggest globalist in
[01:37.400 --> 01:40.960]  the world is the Chinese Communist dictator. He's the guy they say they think it's going
[01:40.960 --> 01:45.040]  to hold the whole thing together. Of course, David Rockefeller basically created it and
[01:45.040 --> 01:52.600]  that guy wasn't Jewish. So pretty desperate. That's all coming up and so much more. But
[01:52.600 --> 01:58.880]  before we get into all of that, I just briefly wanted to get into Matt Fury, the individual
[01:58.880 --> 02:03.480]  that created, I guess a decade ago, Pepe the Frog that we really don't care about, that
[02:03.480 --> 02:08.120]  became a symbol of the campaign, a meme, not a meme we created or even really picked up
[02:08.120 --> 02:13.440]  on. And of course, we've been selling a poster, the third party artist made that's got a bunch
[02:13.440 --> 02:21.240]  of images from 2016, totally protected speech, transformative art. But beyond that, beyond
[02:21.240 --> 02:25.000]  that, we're a third party selling it. So no connection will be instantly thrown out
[02:25.000 --> 02:28.920]  of court. The problem is it will cost us money to deal with it. That's why we have the countersuit
[02:28.920 --> 02:34.720]  with slapback statues where the Democrats will just keep killing us to have 5,000 cuts.
[02:34.720 --> 02:37.560]  So people aren't going to get a paper cut back now when they sue us. They're going to
[02:37.560 --> 02:44.960]  get a giant war hammer, depositions, PIs and everything else. So enjoy yourselves. Everybody's
[02:44.960 --> 02:49.960]  already on the ground. Start enjoying. Now, that said, they want to fight. They got one.
[02:49.960 --> 02:56.880]  The thirdly, third strike and even more devastating, our own Michael Zimmerman, the intrepid researcher
[02:56.880 --> 03:05.200]  in Infowars, found this from the Daily Dot 2015, before I even heard of Pepe, when he
[03:05.200 --> 03:14.200]  was the number one thing on 4chan, the frog, and Mr. Fury said that quote, this is an interview
[03:14.200 --> 03:18.480]  with the Daily Dot. By the way, we found more quotes from saying this. What about people
[03:18.480 --> 03:23.320]  profiting off Pepe? I believe in supporting people's decision to profit off Pepe in order
[03:23.320 --> 03:28.880]  to provide them with the most positive business experience possible. I strive to be an advocate
[03:28.880 --> 03:34.000]  for Pepe in both love and enterprise and hope to help business people to have an empowering
[03:34.000 --> 03:38.720]  and joyful experience while making an ocean of profits and limitless as the universe.
[03:38.720 --> 03:43.480]  He goes on to say, I don't care why supremacists are using it. Good people are using it too.
[03:43.480 --> 03:49.080]  This guy's made so much money off the internet taking a comic book he put out in 2005 that
[03:49.080 --> 03:54.280]  reportedly had almost no sales. Somebody picked it up. Now, he's got all these distribution
[03:54.280 --> 03:59.720]  deals, all these sales deals, and he's coming back saying even private citizens as memes
[03:59.720 --> 04:05.720]  can't use it. That's what they're going to try to do with the TPP, use trademark to falsely
[04:05.720 --> 04:13.000]  applied, fraudulently applied, abusively applied to shut down free speech worldwide. That's
[04:13.000 --> 04:17.400]  why the left, you know, the good left was so against TPP along with the libertarian
[04:17.400 --> 04:23.440]  right because it was so draconian. So this is unbelievable. He says use it. It's public
[04:23.440 --> 04:30.120]  use. It's free to use. Everybody then uses it. An artist creates a poster with 5% of
[04:30.120 --> 04:34.960]  the poster being Pepe. Images of the campaign totally protected. Supreme Court rulings just
[04:34.960 --> 04:41.360]  incredibly protected. And then he goes further, puts out a press release libeling us saying
[04:41.360 --> 04:46.880]  we're like supremacists basically tying our name to it. To do famous, we'll be right
[04:46.880 --> 04:48.360]  back. Stay with us.
[05:00.360 --> 05:06.600]  Introducing Cell Force by Info Wars Life. Cell Force focuses on mitochondria efficiency
[05:06.600 --> 05:12.560]  and protection. Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy. They are your body's cellular
[05:12.560 --> 05:18.520]  engines. Cell Force helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria.
[05:18.520 --> 05:23.560]  Much like a cellular engine overhaul. Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100%
[05:23.560 --> 05:29.280]  efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species. Top scientists agree that
[05:29.280 --> 05:36.000]  aging is most likely caused by cellular damage, resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[05:36.000 --> 05:41.040]  The antioxidants found in Cell Force are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[05:41.040 --> 05:45.840]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen
[05:45.840 --> 05:53.640]  species and other free radicals. Boost, protect, and adapt with Cell Force from Info Wars Life.
[05:53.640 --> 05:59.760]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[05:59.760 --> 06:06.760]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[06:20.760 --> 06:28.240]  Well, huge news breaking right now. Where Info Wars is under attack, free speech is under attack,
[06:28.240 --> 06:33.240]  conservative speech is under attack. Well, we're fighting back. Not only is our audience
[06:33.240 --> 06:37.040]  fighting back by supporting us at InfoWarsLife.com, now you have the Trump administration, the
[06:37.040 --> 06:42.520]  Trump campaign manager, Brad Parsgill, warning Big Tech on Twitter. Hey, Facebook, Google,
[06:42.520 --> 06:46.720]  Twitter, Facebook, everybody, we're watching. This is your opportunity to make sure the
[06:46.720 --> 06:54.240]  playing field is level. Alex Jones obviously was spearheading the watching of the Big
[06:54.240 --> 06:58.440]  Tech giants that are centering conservatives. He's on the phone with us now. Alex, when
[06:58.440 --> 07:02.640]  you saw this, what was the first thing that came to your mind seeing Trump's new campaign
[07:02.640 --> 07:07.640]  manager saying, hey, look, Big Tech, we're watching you, we know what you're doing?
[07:07.640 --> 07:13.560]  Well, news was coming thanks to the audience and thanks to Drudge Report and thanks to
[07:13.560 --> 07:19.240]  everybody else speaking out and pointing out that there is a purge of not just InfoWars,
[07:19.240 --> 07:25.080]  but thousands and thousands of Christian, pro-gun, pro-military, shooting clubs, you
[07:25.080 --> 07:32.560]  name it, in the last three weeks, and that actually News Corp met with Google, Facebook,
[07:32.560 --> 07:37.320]  and Twitter going back again about four and a half weeks ago and bragged that they were
[07:37.320 --> 07:41.840]  going to work with the left to come in and shut down censorship. Well, now there's the
[07:41.840 --> 07:47.240]  headline up on InfoWars.com directly linking to his tweets, Brad Parsgill, who was really,
[07:47.240 --> 07:50.360]  you know, one of the chief people in the Trump campaign, head of their internet operations
[07:50.360 --> 07:55.720]  now the head of Trump 2020, which means really head of Trump's outreach to the public for
[07:55.720 --> 08:01.320]  the next three years as we go into 2020. So the Trump administration fires first shot
[08:01.320 --> 08:07.600]  across Big Tech's bow, warns them of censorship, Trump 2020 campaign manager Brad Parsgill
[08:07.600 --> 08:13.920]  warns Big Tech, we are watching, and then we've got his tweet here, hey, Facebook, Twitter,
[08:13.920 --> 08:18.160]  and Google, we are watching, this is your opportunity to make sure the playing field
[08:18.160 --> 08:23.480]  is level. And of course, the playing field is not level. Hillary is openly cheerleading
[08:23.480 --> 08:28.560]  that she's planning to run again insanely, or Joe Biden, that don't worry, she'll win
[08:28.560 --> 08:32.880]  because by the time she runs, and by the time 2018 is over, they're going to have internet
[08:32.880 --> 08:37.960]  censorship in place. But the great news is, now the White House gets it, they know what's
[08:37.960 --> 08:44.320]  going on, they've put two top lawyers in at the Securities and Exchange Commission, and
[08:44.320 --> 08:49.440]  also at the Federal Trade Commission, heading up both groups that are anti-trust, that are
[08:49.440 --> 08:53.640]  anti-monopoly, and then understand what Google, Facebook, and Twitter have been doing creating
[08:53.640 --> 08:58.080]  these monopolies and then discriminating. So this is really, really super news, and
[08:58.080 --> 09:02.760]  everybody's got to get the article out that's on infowars.com. There's another article about
[09:02.760 --> 09:08.600]  it as well, it's very well written, at rightbark.com. Of course, DrudgeReport.com, along with American
[09:08.600 --> 09:12.880]  people, receives the lion's share of credit, and it's not about credit, but we need to
[09:12.880 --> 09:17.040]  realize how closely we are to oblivion. If Drudge hadn't pointed out the conservative
[09:17.040 --> 09:21.960]  purge starting three weeks ago, and followed Dr. Corsi being banned, and us being banned,
[09:21.960 --> 09:26.280]  and everybody else being banned, and linked directly to it, and made it the number one
[09:26.280 --> 09:31.520]  story off and on for several days, it wouldn't have broken out, it wouldn't have gotten
[09:31.520 --> 09:36.720]  into the White House. So thank God for DrudgeReport.com. This is a huge situation. I hope throughout
[09:36.720 --> 09:41.720]  the day you cover it more, and talk about all the gas, because we as an audience need
[09:41.720 --> 09:45.440]  to keep pushing this, and let this be their water loom, because they thought they'd come
[09:45.440 --> 09:51.000]  in, censor us, engage in incredibly draconian, abusive systems. They thought that they would
[09:51.000 --> 09:57.080]  get away with all of this, but now it is completely, and totally, and absolutely blown up in their
[09:57.080 --> 10:01.840]  face spectacularly, but we've got to keep pushing, keep pushing, and we're getting ready to file
[10:01.840 --> 10:05.280]  lawsuits, because we've got a lot going on, obviously, they keep hitting us with new ones
[10:05.280 --> 10:09.000]  when we prepare for the next ones, but we are preparing the lawsuits, we're preparing
[10:09.000 --> 10:14.280]  the protest against Google, Twitter, Facebook. They want to fight, they've got one, that's
[10:14.280 --> 10:18.200]  our motto here, you want to fight, but we've got one, because there's a one for your mind,
[10:18.200 --> 10:24.240]  so it's on. Now shifting here to another huge top story, you knew it was coming. They denied
[10:24.240 --> 10:27.960]  the global government, they denied corporate world government, their tax exempted above
[10:27.960 --> 10:32.400]  the law, but once you force people to admit that Google, Facebook, Twitter, Amazon pay
[10:32.400 --> 10:36.680]  zero tax, that they run basically Chinese slave factories in many cases, in the case
[10:36.680 --> 10:41.920]  of Apple and others, once you show their ally with the Communist Chinese, people get why
[10:41.920 --> 10:45.240]  they're funding leftist movements, why they're funding the breakup of the family, why they're
[10:45.240 --> 10:49.000]  funding the beta male movement to weaken this country, and they brag about it, and they
[10:49.000 --> 10:53.800]  celebrate it as a sickening, admit it total and complete takeover, like the goals of
[10:53.800 --> 10:58.840]  the Communist that came out in the House Committee on American Activities in the 50s, they said
[10:58.840 --> 11:03.120]  the plan is to bring up the family and emasculate the male. Well, that has been done, and it's
[11:03.120 --> 11:07.760]  all declassified now. Those of us that are resisting are now called the enemy, and it's
[11:07.760 --> 11:13.760]  an incredible time to be alive. So now at Huffington Post, MSNBC, you name it, they're
[11:13.760 --> 11:18.040]  saying when people bring up the fact that, okay, you know, you're getting rid of globalists,
[11:18.040 --> 11:22.320]  you know, we're getting rid of people. Fox News asked the question like Cohen and others
[11:22.320 --> 11:26.520]  that believe in global government, that believe in a private corporate group, basically ruling
[11:26.520 --> 11:32.400]  the world, will Trump bring in another globalist? And I don't care if he brings in globalists,
[11:32.400 --> 11:35.680]  as long as we get our policies, because globalists know how to get things done and where the bodies
[11:35.680 --> 11:40.840]  are buried, so it's all about policy. They're now calling that anti-Semitic. Now listen,
[11:40.840 --> 11:45.280]  David Rockefeller created modern globalism. It just means private corporate world government
[11:45.280 --> 11:50.240]  tax exempt that then gets so powerful and so wealthy it takes up the nation state and
[11:50.240 --> 11:54.840]  sets up a world government, okay, with a new form of royalty, basically. It's corporate
[11:54.840 --> 11:59.600]  fascism, corporate crony capitalism taken to the extreme, and then it works and sets
[11:59.600 --> 12:06.440]  up dictatorships and forms of oppression in the different zones it controls. So the Chinese
[12:06.440 --> 12:14.400]  dictator went to Davos 14 months ago, 13 months ago, in 2017 and said, I will defeat Trump,
[12:14.400 --> 12:19.560]  I will defeat America, all us globalists rally behind China, we will win. Yunker, the air
[12:19.560 --> 12:25.240]  to the Nazi fortune, the dictator of the EU, unelected, said, I agree. We will join forces
[12:25.240 --> 12:31.400]  to stop America and stop their economic recovery, and we'll launch economic warfare on them
[12:31.400 --> 12:38.160]  to stop them. They failed in the last 13, 14 months. So that's globalism. A grandson
[12:38.160 --> 12:42.560]  of the richest Nazi family, his father was a top Nazi, and his grandfather was the number
[12:42.560 --> 12:47.280]  two Nazi in Germany economically, number one economically, but number two beside Hitler.
[12:47.280 --> 12:51.160]  Yunker bombers, hold on yards, look it up, folks. And the Chinese Communist Dictatorship,
[12:51.160 --> 12:57.480]  so a Nazi and a communist Chinese person are at the top of globalism. It's a world system,
[12:57.480 --> 13:01.520]  but now you can't label tyranny, tyranny, because they're going to say, oh, you know,
[13:01.520 --> 13:05.200]  prove world government's real, and the system of world government is called globalism.
[13:05.200 --> 13:10.800]  Different from world citizens or world travelers or world peace or people working together.
[13:10.800 --> 13:15.680]  That's fine. I'm not against people being international. That's great. What I'm saying
[13:15.680 --> 13:21.280]  is globalism is an authoritarian world model. So now they're saying, if you try to engage
[13:21.280 --> 13:24.280]  in resisting that and exposing it, you're anti-semitic. Well, next, if they don't like
[13:24.280 --> 13:27.720]  the word America or freedom, they'll just say it's anti-semitic. They already say the
[13:27.720 --> 13:31.880]  Declaration of Independence is bad. They already say this, you know, that the Star-Spangled
[13:31.880 --> 13:37.160]  Banner is evil. This is the plan. They can't deny globalism as the world system. They
[13:37.160 --> 13:40.160]  can't deny it's authoritarian. So now they're just going to claim it's anti-semitic. Here
[13:40.160 --> 13:43.560]  is a short clip of Sarah Huckabee Sanders being asked about it.
[13:43.560 --> 13:48.680]  To ask her just about Gary Tung, who's a noted free trader or globalist, will the President
[13:48.680 --> 13:52.720]  seek another globalist, another free trader? I'm not going to get ahead of the President's
[13:52.720 --> 13:57.640]  announcement on who will replace Gary. Follow up on...
[13:57.640 --> 14:04.640]  So there you go. And they go on to say, oh my gosh, will he be replaced for another globalist?
[14:04.640 --> 14:08.640]  And that just means someone that supports this hegemonic global power structure. I'll
[14:08.640 --> 14:11.600]  ensure I've got a few other topics I'm going to hit after this break, and then I'm going
[14:11.600 --> 14:17.880]  to turn the ship over to you. I've got some really interesting, important information
[14:17.880 --> 14:22.960]  going on here with not just California, but Colorado and other areas. Just watching the
[14:22.960 --> 14:27.360]  local news while I'm here in Colorado. What I've been trying to watch, I was in a restaurant
[14:27.360 --> 14:31.720]  and saw an illegal alien who's done hit and runs, other crimes, you name it. The Sheriff's
[14:31.720 --> 14:36.680]  Department is protecting him from deportation. We've also got, you know, out in California,
[14:36.680 --> 14:42.840]  it turns out, ICE. People are warned about ICE who were convicted felons, robbers, rapists,
[14:42.840 --> 14:46.680]  you name it. I mean, this is just the lawlessness of the globalist, waging war against this
[14:46.680 --> 14:51.680]  country. But look how far we've come, Owen. But now, globalism's out in the open. World
[14:51.680 --> 14:55.760]  government's out in the open. Big tech censorship of nationalists, conservatives, Christians,
[14:55.760 --> 14:59.920]  veterans is out in the open. I mean, I'm telling you, as long as we fight back, we're going
[14:59.920 --> 15:02.840]  to win. And that's why this audience is so awesome, because they are the heart of this
[15:02.840 --> 15:03.840]  thing.
[15:03.840 --> 15:10.440]  Well, and I think the fact that Brad Parscale is warning Facebook, Twitter and Google tells
[15:10.440 --> 15:15.040]  you that he sees our audience crying, saying, look at the censorship of free speech. He
[15:15.040 --> 15:19.600]  sees info wars. He sees everyone. He sees Republican candidates that are getting banned
[15:19.600 --> 15:24.120]  on Facebook, getting banned on Twitter. And so he's like, look, we're watching you. We
[15:24.120 --> 15:29.200]  see what's going on. This is the info war. You better have a level playing field. Or
[15:29.200 --> 15:33.560]  I don't know, maybe there's an antitrust lawsuit in your future. Maybe you need to be
[15:33.560 --> 15:38.200]  broken up in the future. So this is the info war. We've been preparing for it, Alex. And
[15:38.200 --> 15:41.960]  thank God you have the audience and you've built this platform to run independently.
[15:41.960 --> 15:46.880]  The audience, the audience, but that's the key is Trump just giving a rope to hang themselves
[15:46.880 --> 16:00.200]  or is he not acting enough? We take action now.
[16:00.200 --> 16:05.280]  Ever since ID stronghold created RFID blocking wallet technology over 10 years ago, major
[16:05.280 --> 16:09.360]  designer brands have tried to create their own versions. But do they really work? We
[16:09.360 --> 16:14.520]  let real people test designer brand RFID blocking wallets using the same rigorous testing ID
[16:14.520 --> 16:17.800]  stronghold wallets go through. So how did the designer brands do?
[16:17.800 --> 16:22.160]  I expected notable brands to perform well. And I was pretty surprised to see that it
[16:22.160 --> 16:26.960]  was not fully protective wallets by those big brand names that I like and trust don't
[16:26.960 --> 16:31.040]  really do what they're advertising that they do. Get a stronghold on your credit cards,
[16:31.040 --> 16:36.040]  license and other critical data with ID stronghold wallets. Other RFID blocking wallets simply
[16:36.040 --> 16:40.680]  aren't the same. ID stronghold just outperformed them in every aspect. I would definitely recommend
[16:40.680 --> 16:44.680]  ID stronghold wallets to my friends and family. Check the label. If it doesn't say it's an
[16:44.680 --> 16:49.600]  ID stronghold, it's not. I'm very impressed with the ID stronghold wallet. Get the most
[16:49.600 --> 16:56.000]  trusted brand in RFID blocking wallets and protect yourself from electronic tick cocketing.

[19:00.000 --> 19:06.280]  Let's go to Devin in Florida. Devin in Florida you're on the air.
[19:06.280 --> 19:12.160]  Great. Hey, thank you so much. Listen, I have bought your product and I gotta say they're
[19:12.160 --> 19:18.600]  amazing. It was on the fence by it because I've got caveman, superman vitality, secret
[19:18.600 --> 19:22.160]  swell, vitamin interfusion. I've got the body armor.
[19:22.160 --> 19:23.160]  Wow, thank you.
[19:23.160 --> 19:24.160]  Wow.
[19:24.160 --> 19:26.520]  You're the type of listener that makes it all possible. Which nutraceutical does you
[19:26.520 --> 19:27.520]  like best?
[19:27.520 --> 19:30.960]  I really like the vitamin mineral fusion to be honest. That's amazing.
[19:30.960 --> 19:35.280]  That's incredible. I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible. Like
[19:35.280 --> 19:40.200]  I haven't felt sweet. My morning was fantastic and I love the guys. I love the info wars
[19:40.200 --> 19:47.160]  crew and I just want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence
[19:47.160 --> 19:51.600]  just buy it. We'll love it. I'm telling you, I've never bought a bad product.
[19:51.600 --> 19:56.000]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at infowarslife.com.
[19:56.000 --> 20:04.120]  It's a win-win infowarslife.com.
[20:04.120 --> 20:21.840]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:21.840 --> 20:27.960]  Coming to you from the former United States of America, from deep in the heart of Texas,
[20:27.960 --> 20:29.680]  it's Alex Jones.
[20:29.680 --> 20:36.680]  Well, we're making America great again. Alex Jones is enjoying the spoils of capitalism
[20:36.680 --> 20:40.440]  right now, but cannot take a break because we're constantly under attack. But it looks
[20:40.440 --> 20:46.440]  like the Trump administration has our back as Brad Parscale tweets out today. Google,
[20:46.440 --> 20:49.880]  Facebook, Twitter, we're watching you. We know what you're doing. You've got a chance
[20:49.880 --> 20:55.240]  now to level the playing field and we're watching you. Alex, I don't think they're going to
[20:55.240 --> 20:57.920]  get the message though. I don't think they're going to get the message. I think they have
[20:57.920 --> 21:01.520]  to continue with their plan of censorship. They have to stop us from getting the truth
[21:01.520 --> 21:06.640]  out. They have to stop independent media from being free thinkers. So I think that what you
[21:06.640 --> 21:10.480]  alluded to earlier is kind of accurate. I think maybe this is just baiting them and
[21:10.480 --> 21:16.280]  maybe them getting a false air of confidence here, just so the next round of warnings to
[21:16.280 --> 21:17.280]  come through.
[21:17.280 --> 21:21.440]  Well, absolutely. And I've seen this with Trump over and over again. He's taken the
[21:21.440 --> 21:28.200]  high road and giving a rope to censor and censor and censor and then build huge amounts
[21:28.200 --> 21:33.360]  of anger in the country so that we didn't have the political capital to actually punish
[21:33.360 --> 21:39.600]  these authoritarians. But words cannot describe how draconian thousands of Christian, number
[21:39.600 --> 21:44.680]  one Christian, number two, Second Amendment, number three, libertarian style talk radio.
[21:44.680 --> 21:50.800]  All of us have been censored on a huge scale, number four scene. The Project Earth Houses
[21:50.800 --> 21:55.960]  caught them all on tape bragging how they do it. We have them when it comes to lawsuits,
[21:55.960 --> 21:59.240]  but they're acting like they're going to take over and overthrow Trump and none of that's
[21:59.240 --> 22:05.680]  going to matter. They have a race to the finish line attitude to all of this and it's so
[22:05.680 --> 22:09.840]  long as what they're doing. So I agree with you. I don't think Trump can have his normal
[22:09.840 --> 22:15.960]  policy of letting them have more rope. They've already got plenty of rope and here's the
[22:15.960 --> 22:23.320]  takeaway for me. The Democrats, the globalists all over the world, leftist parties funded
[22:23.320 --> 22:28.960]  by George Soros and others are making their move to end free speech, to end nationalism,
[22:28.960 --> 22:33.760]  to end the family, to end Christianity, to end sovereignty. I mean, Apple's merging
[22:33.760 --> 22:38.120]  with Communist China. The Pope's saying Communist China is the ultimate form of Christianity.
[22:38.120 --> 22:41.840]  He's been taking off Apple's calendar and they said, no, we did that on purpose, but
[22:41.840 --> 22:48.560]  Ramadan's on there. This is a globalist move against us by an yardstick and the attacks
[22:48.560 --> 22:52.320]  on the First Amendment in this country are way beyond the second right now. And it comes
[22:52.320 --> 22:56.560]  first because it protects the second. If the first fails, then it goes to the second.
[22:56.560 --> 23:01.680]  He is number one for a reason. I agree with the founders and if anybody was gun nuts,
[23:01.680 --> 23:05.640]  it was them. The first is more important than the second because it motivates everything.
[23:05.640 --> 23:09.440]  With the First Amendment, if I still have that and they've taken all our guns, I can
[23:09.440 --> 23:13.440]  still motivate people to wake up and take action and take the guns from the enemy and
[23:13.440 --> 23:18.240]  win again. But without the First, no amount of guns matter because you have command and
[23:18.240 --> 23:24.120]  control and leadership and ideology and policy and ideas. So ladies and gentlemen, we carry
[23:24.120 --> 23:28.800]  the light in the dark of the night. This is epic history. And that's why I start hyperventilating
[23:28.800 --> 23:33.160]  because this is so crazy. But because of you getting upset listeners and because of drugs
[23:33.160 --> 23:37.160]  getting upset and because of congressmen and I got to give credit. I mean, he's so articulate,
[23:37.160 --> 23:40.680]  so great. Senator Ted Cruz, that's why when he got a little bit dirty during the campaign,
[23:40.680 --> 23:45.000]  I got really upset with him, but he's totally decimating him. Congressional hearings. We
[23:45.000 --> 23:50.560]  played those clips, but they can't stop. The more they get exposed, the more they censor
[23:50.560 --> 23:55.000]  because they're like corner rats. So ladies and gentlemen, you did it. You got upset.
[23:55.000 --> 24:00.640]  You backed them off. And then predictably, BuzzFeed, The Washington Post, other fake
[24:00.640 --> 24:05.000]  news outlets said that we made it up. No one was censored. There wasn't a part. There
[24:05.000 --> 24:09.080]  wasn't CNN calling for our banning. There wasn't CNN private tech responses. There wasn't
[24:09.080 --> 24:12.800]  CNN trying to block my book being published. Of course, all that happened. There wasn't
[24:12.800 --> 24:17.160]  Pepe the Frog lawsuit or the Communist Party suing us or other lawsuits I'm not going to
[24:17.160 --> 24:21.600]  get into yet on air. All Democratic Party. I have two former Clinton lawyers that work
[24:21.600 --> 24:25.960]  directly under her suing me right now. Okay. I mean, this is two of the biggest law firms
[24:25.960 --> 24:33.000]  in the country. Okay. So some of those prestigious and then filing things like the Pepe thing
[24:33.000 --> 24:38.640]  where he said, everybody can use this. It's copyright free in 2015. He can't go back.
[24:38.640 --> 24:42.680]  Even though ours is a transformative work and isn't even our work at third party, they
[24:42.680 --> 24:48.600]  don't even care. These lawyers sit down and they, and they just don't care because there's
[24:48.600 --> 24:52.760]  this idea that they're going to win because they're mobilized and they're aggressive.
[24:52.760 --> 24:56.760]  We have to get mobilized. We have to get aggressive and in closing, I'll hand this over to Alan
[24:56.760 --> 25:01.920]  doing a great job financially. I have committed to sue these people for everybody's free speech.
[25:01.920 --> 25:05.960]  These are watershed cases for everybody just as important as the second amendment. Just
[25:05.960 --> 25:09.800]  like I tell folks who joined the NRA and got owners of America, you join us by signing
[25:09.800 --> 25:13.160]  up for auto ship and getting four out of free toothpaste. If everybody just got our super
[25:13.160 --> 25:16.520]  blue four out of free toothpaste, four to five, a coil silver and high nine, nobody else
[25:16.520 --> 25:21.600]  has got it. It's super popular. 5,000 plus five star reviews. That would fund their operation,
[25:21.600 --> 25:26.440]  but only maybe 1% of our audience buy stuff and I'm not complaining. I'm just saying folks,
[25:26.440 --> 25:29.960]  I'm committed. I need your commitment. Everybody just signs up for auto ship once a month to
[25:29.960 --> 25:33.520]  get the toothpaste. It's great. We'll make three, four bucks on each tube. That would
[25:33.520 --> 25:36.920]  fund the operation right there and help me defend the first amendment. They're coming
[25:36.920 --> 25:42.520]  after us all. I could try to shut down Patrick Henry or Sam Adams printing press. This is
[25:42.520 --> 25:48.320]  really going down, ladies and gentlemen. We need you to continue to commit, spread the
[25:48.320 --> 25:51.800]  word, spread the article, spread the videos. It's a fight, 12 rounds. We're about seven
[25:51.800 --> 25:55.320]  rounds in. We're winning, but both sides are bloody. We've got a bunch of specials that
[25:55.320 --> 26:00.960]  in this week of extended last week, 30 to 80% off, brain force, super male, super female
[26:00.960 --> 26:06.200]  about talenting, alpha power, bodies, our great tumor formula, I think still sold out
[26:06.200 --> 26:10.960]  by your ads running for it. All these products are going to stay at this price for the rest
[26:10.960 --> 26:15.040]  of the week, but a lot of them are selling out. Thank you for your support, but again,
[26:15.040 --> 26:18.760]  without you, ladies and gentlemen, we are nothing and they just hope you forget. They
[26:18.760 --> 26:23.160]  hope you just roll over, but you're not and they're so upset. They don't know what to
[26:23.160 --> 26:27.600]  do and please finally pray for the broadcast, pray for Providence, pray for the country
[26:27.600 --> 26:31.920]  to awaken and please support our local AM and FM affiliates and TV affiliates, become
[26:31.920 --> 26:36.520]  a sponsor, let them know you appreciate them or tithe $20 wherever you can a month to them
[26:36.520 --> 26:39.680]  and all the middle class people and everybody else that have been on the sidelines that thank
[26:39.680 --> 26:43.880]  me and pat me on the back. Listen, I need you to get involved. I need you to write
[26:43.880 --> 26:47.400]  letters to the editor. I need you to call C-SPAN. Get out of your comfort zone. The
[26:47.400 --> 26:51.800]  journey with 1000 miles starts with a single step. Stop just letting 5% of the activists
[26:51.800 --> 26:55.440]  carry the weight. I'm not bitching at you. I'm telling you, don't let the globalists
[26:55.440 --> 26:59.680]  get control. They know we're winning. This will not be politics as usual anymore. If
[26:59.680 --> 27:04.360]  they get back control of the house or Senate or the presidency for even a little bit of
[27:04.360 --> 27:09.080]  time, they are going to come for the free speech. They are going to go full authoritarian.
[27:09.080 --> 27:12.760]  They were gearing up for that for a long time, but our police and military woke up to it
[27:12.760 --> 27:16.160]  and didn't go along with it. That's why they started all the cop killing and the Strong
[27:16.160 --> 27:20.720]  Cities Initiative to bully them under UN control. This is mainstream news. Think how crazy
[27:20.720 --> 27:26.080]  this is to go on with the plan, but that filled as well. We are in an epic, tectonic, ultra
[27:26.080 --> 27:30.000]  massive battle. This is the second American Revolution. Everybody knows it's not hype,
[27:30.000 --> 27:35.080]  so you, the activist audience of info wars, are seen by the enemy. These attacks on myself
[27:35.080 --> 27:39.520]  and the crew are attacks on you. You are seen as the cadre, as the force multiplying
[27:39.520 --> 27:44.360]  feed that they're trying to bury that will defeat them in the end. And they thought
[27:44.360 --> 27:50.040]  they'd buried us, but I was a seed and then it backfired. Back to Owen Shore and the rest
[27:50.040 --> 27:54.480]  of the crew. Please commit to info wars.com. Great products you need shop with a good
[27:54.480 --> 27:58.480]  guy, sign up for auto ship, get 10% off additional free shipping store wide. I should have added
[27:58.480 --> 28:02.000]  that free shipping store wide. It's all in the end this weekend. Thank you. I want to
[28:02.000 --> 28:04.360]  back to the amazing crew. Thank you.
[28:04.360 --> 28:08.760]  So there goes Alex Jones and I'm sure he'll have multiple reports and other special reports
[28:08.760 --> 28:14.360]  as well as this is all developing. And you know, it's amazing just in the just over a
[28:14.360 --> 28:19.280]  year and a half that I've been here at info wars. I've seen it grow exponentially with
[28:19.280 --> 28:24.440]  your support. And I don't see Alex pulling up with a brand new fancy car every day, you
[28:24.440 --> 28:28.920]  know, buying an airplane or a jet or something, buying new mansions. No, I see him building
[28:28.920 --> 28:33.240]  new studios. I see him building actually two new studios right now. I see him hiring
[28:33.240 --> 28:38.800]  new people. I see him expanding the broadcast. So your support at info wars store.com goes
[28:38.800 --> 28:44.000]  back into everything that we do here, hiring the crew, building these great studios, building
[28:44.000 --> 28:51.080]  new studios, expanding our broadcast. I mean, this is how we defeat the fake news is by
[28:51.080 --> 28:55.640]  just getting bigger than them and then just drowning them out. So we'll be right back
[28:55.640 --> 29:01.600]  with all the news on the other side. This is the Alex Jones show here. That's the sound
[29:01.600 --> 29:07.720]  of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransacked the place and what they don't steal
[29:07.720 --> 29:14.320]  will be destroyed this year. Resolve not to be the next victim of a break in go to faketv.com
[29:14.320 --> 29:19.240]  and discover a device that creates the illusion someone inside is watching TV even when you're
[29:19.240 --> 29:25.000]  miles away. Security is a mindset and fake TV should be part of your security solution.
[29:25.000 --> 29:31.640]  Be vigilant but not fearful fake TV.com. This is Dan Billard. You owe the IRS money.

[30:00.200 --> 30:06.520]  I want to plow into all of this. I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging
[30:06.520 --> 30:12.920]  listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books
[30:12.920 --> 30:20.840]  or videos or other material from infowarstore.com, you are funding the revolution. I cannot
[30:20.840 --> 30:26.000]  say it any clearer. It is essential that you purchase the products at infowarstore.com.
[30:26.000 --> 30:29.960]  I want to thank everybody that has but we've got the best fluoride free toothpaste with
[30:29.960 --> 30:35.400]  colloidal silver and with high quality atomic iodine in it. You cannot beat that for children
[30:35.400 --> 30:39.560]  and adults. We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones. That's my dad with
[30:39.560 --> 30:46.480]  colloidal silver and iodine as well. Infowarslife.com or triple-A-2533139 and your purchase of the
[30:46.480 --> 30:51.320]  products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists
[30:51.320 --> 30:55.080]  and their satanic pedophile armies and that's who they are and they know we know who they
[30:55.080 --> 31:01.320]  are and they're coming back against us so we need your support.
[31:01.320 --> 31:05.200]  The reason Infowarslife has five star ratings on major third party sites is because I want
[31:05.200 --> 31:09.000]  products I'm going to use for my family. I take this. My family takes this and then it
[31:09.000 --> 31:12.640]  funds the operation with the most hardcore truthful information you're going to find
[31:12.640 --> 31:16.480]  anywhere. So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at
[31:16.480 --> 31:22.200]  infowarslife.com. If I ever forget to take them, like I'm having noticeable difference.
[31:22.200 --> 31:27.040]  I don't feel good. The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life changing for me.
[31:27.040 --> 31:32.000]  Yeah, I've actually have just run out of my superfemale. I had a few bottles at my house
[31:32.000 --> 31:37.400]  and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again. Very exciting, feeling great,
[31:37.400 --> 31:43.760]  looking good. And I know my hair is luxurious once again. So obviously the superfemale is
[31:43.760 --> 31:45.240]  amazing. I love it.
[31:45.240 --> 31:50.080]  Nascent iodine is essential. Survival Shield X2. If there's one product that I would say
[31:50.080 --> 31:54.840]  is life changing that I would suggest it's nascent iodine. Survival Shield X2. It's
[31:54.840 --> 32:04.480]  got a five star rating. It's a win win infowarslife.com. I'm so excited. The new product at infowarslife.com
[32:04.480 --> 32:10.520]  in a glass bottle, two month servings filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the
[32:10.520 --> 32:16.840]  real red pill. This is a heart and brain pill, a new tropic that doesn't have any stimulants
[32:16.840 --> 32:22.480]  in it. But boy, does it stimulate because it's beyond that. Quite frankly, I just went
[32:22.480 --> 32:28.280]  off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription,
[32:28.280 --> 32:34.320]  but they were charging people $100, $200 for the formulae. And I came up with our own formulae
[32:34.320 --> 32:40.320]  working with some scientists and developers. Non-GMO made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[32:40.320 --> 32:47.120]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglinone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones
[32:47.120 --> 32:53.720]  that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands. It is amazing. Red
[32:53.720 --> 33:15.720]  pill now available at infowarsstore.com and your purchase fuzz the operation.
[33:15.720 --> 33:26.480]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show. And now your host
[33:26.480 --> 33:38.720]  Owen Schreuer. There are distinct differences between the left or liberals and the right
[33:38.720 --> 33:46.240]  or conservatives or Trump supporters, whatever you want to call it. And that generally speaking,
[33:46.240 --> 33:53.040]  we don't really have double standards here. We're pretty much just straight down the line.
[33:53.040 --> 33:59.280]  Call it as we see it. How you treat, how we treat you, we expect you to treat us. Now,
[33:59.280 --> 34:04.840]  you notice that we don't go on air every day calling for CNN to be shut off of cable news.
[34:04.840 --> 34:09.600]  You don't go on air every day saying that our opposition needs to be shut down. Well,
[34:09.600 --> 34:14.040]  I mean, I'll be honest with you. The only, I guess, quote unquote opposition that I think
[34:14.040 --> 34:17.320]  well, it doesn't have to be shut down. It's just, I think NPR should quit getting government
[34:17.320 --> 34:22.280]  funding. I would say any news outlet receiving government funding that needs to be cut immediately.
[34:22.280 --> 34:25.080]  That doesn't necessarily mean they have to be shut down, but now you have to compete
[34:25.080 --> 34:31.680]  in the free market. But we don't call for them to be shut down. See, we're not Nazis. We're
[34:31.680 --> 34:37.800]  not authoritarians. In fact, I'm glad that Don Lemon goes on air for an hour a night
[34:37.800 --> 34:42.240]  and reads off a teleprompter. And then once a week gives me a sound clip that I can expose
[34:42.240 --> 34:49.200]  him as a total moron here on the air. So that's perfectly fine. But that's not them. See, they
[34:49.200 --> 34:54.120]  call for censorship. CNN says we have to ban info wars. They flag our videos. The Southern
[34:54.120 --> 35:02.160]  Poverty Law Center wants us shut down. Even Glenn Beck, the Cuxervative Glenn Beck, even
[35:02.160 --> 35:10.160]  he wants us shut down. We've never called for Glenn Beck to be shut down. So that's
[35:10.160 --> 35:14.320]  the big difference, but it doesn't stop there. And I talked about this yesterday. If you're
[35:14.320 --> 35:21.680]  a Trump supporter, first let's say this. If you're a whatever, Hillary, Bernie, liberal,
[35:21.680 --> 35:27.880]  whatever it is you are, and you go to a conservative event or a Trump event or something, and
[35:27.880 --> 35:31.440]  you're open minded, you'll have a fine time. People aren't going to be rude to you. They're
[35:31.440 --> 35:35.240]  not going to beat you up. They're not going to spit on you. As long as you're fair, you'll
[35:35.240 --> 35:42.520]  have a good time. Now, you take the opposite of that and you say, oh, I'm a Trump supporter.
[35:42.520 --> 35:47.000]  I'll go to a Bernie event or a Hillary event or I'll go to a Trump protest. You've seen
[35:47.000 --> 35:52.760]  what happens. We film it. You get attacked, you get ridiculed, you get cursed at, you
[35:52.760 --> 35:57.360]  get spat on, you get coffee thrown at you. I mean, you've seen it all. We filmed it.
[35:57.360 --> 36:04.280]  So we aren't the ones with double standards. We aren't the hypocrites. And we're also not
[36:04.280 --> 36:08.640]  the racist. That's them. We're also not the ones that colluded with Russia. That's Hillary.
[36:08.640 --> 36:17.880]  So it's funny how that works. Anyway, the news today, first of all, I need like stretch
[36:17.880 --> 36:22.080]  arm strong just to get all the way to the other side of the desk just to try to reach
[36:22.080 --> 36:29.720]  some of these stories. But the big news that we're blowing up, we've got a story right
[36:29.720 --> 36:35.840]  now that we're working on at infowars.com, breaking it all down how we get strikes and
[36:35.840 --> 36:39.160]  then it's one strike, two strike, three strikes and then two strikes and then three strikes
[36:39.160 --> 36:43.120]  again and then two strikes and then one strike. And then there's a media storm and a spin
[36:43.120 --> 36:49.200]  about it. And then you see a bunch of Republican candidates getting censored from Twitter and
[36:49.200 --> 36:55.720]  censored from Facebook. You see all the YouTube channels, the Christian channels, the gun
[36:55.720 --> 37:02.080]  activists channels, the alternative media channels, Trump supporting channels, they
[37:02.080 --> 37:07.160]  get shut down on YouTube. So all of this is going on in the backdrop. So then today, Brad
[37:07.160 --> 37:12.760]  Parsgill tweets out, Hey, Facebook, Twitter, Google, we are watching. This is your opportunity
[37:12.760 --> 37:18.220]  to make sure the playing field is level. So to me, that's a warning to them saying, look,
[37:18.220 --> 37:25.360]  we know what you're doing. We know you're censoring people. We know that you have political bias.
[37:25.360 --> 37:30.800]  And if you continue to do this, we're going to have to take some action. This is your
[37:30.800 --> 37:38.740]  opportunity before we have to take action. Now, I don't suspect those, the tech left
[37:38.740 --> 37:44.200]  to actually hear this warning and they'll probably go about censorship as usual because
[37:44.200 --> 37:49.560]  they have to. This isn't something I think, of course, they want to do it, but they also
[37:49.560 --> 37:54.440]  have to do it because they're losing on the battlefield of ideas. They're losing on the
[37:54.440 --> 37:58.840]  battlefield of policy and they have to do everything they can to try to prop up the
[37:58.840 --> 38:05.640]  fake news against President Trump by silencing out reports and all of the noise that fights
[38:05.640 --> 38:07.800]  back against it.
[38:07.800 --> 38:14.200]  But that's just one huge story today. Look at some of these other huge stories today.
[38:14.200 --> 38:20.280]  Now they say we're Russian bots. They say that Russia has has deceived Americans into
[38:20.280 --> 38:26.080]  supporting Trump, supporting the Second Amendment, supporting America somehow. That's Russian.
[38:26.080 --> 38:33.840]  But now this comes out. China's long arm reaches into American campuses. Beijing is stepping
[38:33.840 --> 38:39.800]  up efforts to inject party ideology into student life. Some Chinese students are crying foul.
[38:39.800 --> 38:47.360]  Well, the story talks about basically how the Chinese government, the Chinese communist
[38:47.360 --> 38:53.240]  government is infiltrating college campuses to spread the ideas of communism. Oh, and
[38:53.240 --> 38:59.280]  then this comes out from the Free Beacon CIA warns of extensive Chinese operation to infiltrate
[38:59.280 --> 39:04.560]  American institutions.
[39:04.560 --> 39:13.760]  So again, think about it like this. You've got herds of college students that march against
[39:13.760 --> 39:19.880]  Trump, indoctrinated liberal college students, they'll protest Trump, they'll march against
[39:19.880 --> 39:24.520]  Trump, and they'll say, you're a Russian operative. You've been fooled by Russia. You're a Russian
[39:24.520 --> 39:32.320]  bot. These are communists. And so you sit here and you scratch your head and you say,
[39:32.320 --> 39:41.880]  why are college universities producing communists? You had the one graduate. Was it from Navy
[39:41.880 --> 39:48.400]  or Army? I think West Point, who puts communism will win in his graduation cap. Why are these
[39:48.400 --> 39:54.040]  universities graduating communists in America? What the heck is going on? Now in the Cold
[39:54.040 --> 40:01.240]  War, you had Russian communists infiltrating the education system to sow the seeds of communism.
[40:01.240 --> 40:09.040]  Now you've got Chinese operations infiltrating the education system to sow the seeds of communism.
[40:09.040 --> 40:16.000]  So for all of you liberal communist college students out there, for all of you socialist
[40:16.000 --> 40:20.680]  Bernie supporters out there at the university, for all of you indoctrinated liberals by your
[40:20.680 --> 40:28.960]  state run public university, understand something. You're a Chinese operative. You have been
[40:28.960 --> 40:37.160]  hacked by China. You have been propagandized by China to thinking communism is great. How
[40:37.160 --> 40:44.000]  does it feel? You've been punked. You've been punked by Chinese propaganda to supporting
[40:44.000 --> 40:54.440]  communism instead of supporting capitalism that's given you everything you've ever imagined,
[40:54.440 --> 41:00.180]  including the grand dose university that you go to to get the ideas of capitalism sewn
[41:00.180 --> 41:07.760]  in your head by Chinese infiltrators. Congratulations. So go march for Bernie Sanders. Go march
[41:07.760 --> 41:13.440]  against Trump. Go support communism. All the while thinking Trump supporters are Russian
[41:13.440 --> 41:21.080]  bots, Russian influenced, understand you've been to see us by China. And you know what?
[41:21.080 --> 41:27.200]  It's not just the universities. It's Hollywood too, because China's buying that. So the next
[41:27.200 --> 41:35.720]  time you want to look at a Trump supporter and say, Russia, Russia, Trump supporter,
[41:35.720 --> 41:43.240]  Russia. Remember, in your indoctrinating education system at the state run universities,
[41:43.240 --> 41:47.020]  they've been infiltrated by China. They've been infiltrated by communists, and they're
[41:47.020 --> 41:52.240]  sowing the seeds of communism. That's an infiltration. That's a foreign infiltration
[41:52.240 --> 41:58.280]  into your mind. You've actually been incepted. China has incepted you. How does that feel?
[41:58.280 --> 42:05.160]  China has now incepted college students to love communism and hate capitalism, and now
[42:05.160 --> 42:12.920]  they march against Trump and love crazy Bernie Sanders. And you cannot make this up. And
[42:12.920 --> 42:22.200]  then meanwhile, it was amazing how in the last year or two, terms like globalist, globalism
[42:22.200 --> 42:26.860]  and deep state are now household terms. You hear them on the news every night. You never
[42:26.860 --> 42:32.440]  heard the term globalism. You never heard the term deep state, false flag, except right
[42:32.440 --> 42:39.920]  here until about two years ago. You never heard any of that except right here until
[42:39.920 --> 42:45.400]  about two years ago. But now the MSM, the mainstream media is trying to twist it. And
[42:45.400 --> 42:50.440]  they're saying the stories by Kit Daniels at infowars.com to say it's anti-Semitic to
[42:50.440 --> 42:59.680]  say globalist. No, it's just pro nation state pro sovereignty to not be a globalist.

[46:44.060 --> 46:51.060]  this. The only way we save our country and our freedom is to fight this violence of lies
[46:51.060 --> 46:57.620]  with a clenched fist of truth. I'm the National Rifle Association of America and I'm Freedom's
[46:57.620 --> 47:25.620]  Safest Place.
[47:28.620 --> 47:37.620]  Oh, it's my favorite time of year in Austin, Texas. South by Southwest is here, not. It's
[47:37.620 --> 47:42.340]  like my least favorite time of year, to be honest. Traffic is worse. A bunch of smelly
[47:42.340 --> 47:49.140]  people invade. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be mean here, but Me Too is taking over South
[47:49.140 --> 47:54.780]  by Southwest. So now it's going to be even more loving and liberal and tolerant and you've
[47:54.780 --> 48:01.180]  got 50 panels. Oh, excuse me, excuse me. I don't want to sell you short here, folks.
[48:01.180 --> 48:08.540]  More than 50 panels, more than 50 hashtag Me Too panels focused on harassment and gender
[48:08.540 --> 48:15.860]  parity. What would we do without South by Southwest except have a lot better time next
[48:15.860 --> 48:25.060]  week in Austin, Texas? But we'll be shooting reports, I'm sure. Oh my gosh. I'm sorry.
[48:25.060 --> 48:35.100]  I can't stand South by Southwest. Oh, oh, oh. But we'll be filing reports and we'll be
[48:35.100 --> 48:38.780]  out there and we'll be dealing with it. You know, I went last year. You know, they kicked
[48:38.780 --> 48:44.140]  me out. I could they literally anytime we had people stalking me and my cameraman anywhere
[48:44.140 --> 48:51.900]  we went and they would harass us and they kept telling us we had to move. Oh, more than
[48:51.900 --> 48:58.740]  50 hashtag Me Too panels will be focused, focusing on harassment and gender parity at
[48:58.740 --> 49:04.100]  South by Southwest this year. Now, the reason why I'm actually going here, there is a rhyme
[49:04.100 --> 49:10.380]  to my reason. Bernie Sanders is going to be at South by Southwest tomorrow being interviewed
[49:10.380 --> 49:18.700]  by Jake Tapper. So Tweety Bird will be interviewing the crazed socialist. Crazy Bernie. What does
[49:18.700 --> 49:24.060]  Trump say? He's crazier than a bat or something. Bed bug. He's crazier than a bed bug. He kind
[49:24.060 --> 49:29.140]  of looks like a bed bug. He looks like he just rolled out a bed bug. So Tapper will be interviewing
[49:29.140 --> 49:35.060]  Bernie. And that'll go just fine. You've also got Sadiq Khan coming to town. I mean, see,
[49:35.060 --> 49:42.780]  this is why, you know, Bernie Sanders come to town. Sadiq Khan coming to town. What does
[49:42.780 --> 49:48.820]  Sadiq Khan say? Well, whatever Sadiq Khan says, wherever Sadiq Khan goes, you know,
[49:48.820 --> 49:53.060]  terrorism just becomes part and parcel. So Sadiq Khan is coming to Austin. So I guess
[49:53.060 --> 49:57.020]  I should just expect terrorism to be part and parcel than to because that's what happens
[49:57.020 --> 50:03.260]  when Sadiq Khan is in your city, according to Sadiq Khan. But you'll notice something.
[50:03.260 --> 50:07.780]  Although I don't know this for sure, but I'm guessing that you're not going to have a bunch
[50:07.780 --> 50:14.540]  of rabid foaming at the mouth, mask wearing, violent protesters outside of Bernie Sanders
[50:14.540 --> 50:20.260]  interview. I doubt you'll have a bunch of vile, disgusting hate mongers outside of Sadiq
[50:20.260 --> 50:25.220]  Khan's interview during South by Southwest. I highly doubt that any conservatives or any
[50:25.220 --> 50:32.540]  Trump supporters will be trying to shut those interviews down by using violence, intimidation,
[50:32.540 --> 50:39.300]  terrorist tactics and Nazi tactics. That's what the left does. And I mean, these videos
[50:39.300 --> 50:43.100]  surface all the time. I had one in the news. I think it was yesterday or two days ago.
[50:43.100 --> 50:50.660]  I didn't even go to it. But here's Jordan Peterson goes to Queens University. And of
[50:50.660 --> 51:01.180]  course, what happens? Violent leftist protesters storm it and want it shut down. Burn it down.
[51:01.180 --> 51:20.580]  How loving? The guy is just like a philosopher, a logician, if you will. Look at these people.
[51:20.580 --> 51:40.700]  Shame, shame. Wow, we're dealing with mental illness. Look at these nuts. So how much you
[51:40.700 --> 51:44.740]  want to bet you're not going to see something like this when Bernie Sanders is in town or
[51:44.740 --> 51:51.220]  when Sadiq Khan is in town waving things around with making noises, chanting, trying to shut
[51:51.220 --> 52:05.380]  things down, saying, burn people. No. Shame on you. Shame on you. Look, they're harassing
[52:05.380 --> 52:10.660]  this young girl. She's just like, Hello, I'm trying to get through here. Can you move?
[52:10.660 --> 52:17.660]  Shame on you. I'm not even here for the event. Can you get out the way? I don't care. I hate
[52:17.660 --> 52:22.020]  everyone right now. Where's Jordan Peterson? I don't know where he is, but you're the closest
[52:22.020 --> 52:28.380]  person to me. Shame, shame. She's like, I'm just trying to go to class. What's going on?
[52:28.380 --> 52:33.020]  You're not going to see this outside of Bernie Sanders, Jake Tapper interview. You're not
[52:33.020 --> 52:38.020]  going to see this outside of Sadiq Khan's interview, even though Sadiq Khan says terrorism
[52:38.020 --> 52:45.660]  is part and parceled any major city. Well, not here. So maybe it's just you, Khan. Look
[52:45.660 --> 52:53.820]  at that. Look at that. You know, I just, I'm going to try not to be mean here. I was probably
[52:53.820 --> 53:02.500]  mean enough yesterday. You know, where do you go from there? Where do you go? See, this
[53:02.500 --> 53:07.780]  is what I'm saying. We don't call for CNN to be shut down. We don't attack them with
[53:07.780 --> 53:13.820]  violence and lies. We just take what they say and we say, look at how much they're lying
[53:13.820 --> 53:20.300]  to you. Look at how much they deceive the public. And then they say, shut infowars down, flag
[53:20.300 --> 53:29.100]  their videos, attack them, censor them. You had Alex actually mentioned this story earlier.
[53:29.100 --> 53:33.300]  He alluded to it. He didn't get into it though. Denver Sheriff Shields illegal hit and run
[53:33.300 --> 53:40.700]  suspect from ICE deportation. Now, the mayor of Oakland gets to aid and abet criminals.
[53:40.700 --> 53:48.180]  She gets away with it. You have a non-citizen shoot and kill Kate Signley. He gets away
[53:48.180 --> 53:58.900]  with it. Now you have a hit and run suspect, a non-citizen who is going to be free to walk
[53:58.900 --> 54:09.460]  the streets and get away with it and not get deported. So this is what happens when you
[54:09.460 --> 54:15.740]  let criminals run the city. I had actually a lot of people attack me saying, why are
[54:15.740 --> 54:19.140]  you so insensitive to the homeless, Owen? You're complaining about the homeless guy
[54:19.140 --> 54:23.940]  with his truck and everything. No, I'm not being insensitive to the homeless. I'm saying
[54:23.940 --> 54:31.100]  when you let that element of society run society, society is going to be turned into dregs.
[54:31.100 --> 54:38.700]  That's what I'm saying. When Libby's chef and non-citizens get away with crime that
[54:38.700 --> 54:43.260]  the average American citizen can't get away with, this is how society becomes dregs. This
[54:43.260 --> 54:49.420]  is how you create a third world country. There is no justice. And I've got this whole stack
[54:49.420 --> 54:56.660]  of news. I might as well just go into it now. California leaders rebuke Sessions as going
[54:56.660 --> 55:01.460]  to war over state immigration policy. Now apparently Sessions has said no, California
[55:01.460 --> 55:07.300]  can't succeed. I say let him succeed. I say give us New California instead of creating
[55:07.300 --> 55:13.140]  the 51st state of New California and then having the old California. Just let California
[55:13.140 --> 55:17.540]  succeed and then we'll take New California and then the old California will turn into
[55:17.540 --> 55:23.940]  a third world nation and we'll yet again have a case study of why communism fails every time.
[55:23.940 --> 55:28.580]  But they're fighting back and I want to use his exact language here. Governor Jerry Brown
[55:28.580 --> 55:35.980]  in response to Jeff Sessions yesterday says Sessions is initiating a reign of terror against
[55:35.980 --> 55:41.180]  immigrants in California. Now do you understand how big of a liar Governor Jerry Brown is?
[55:41.180 --> 55:47.700]  Do you understand how big of a phony Governor Jerry Brown is? Initiating a reign of terror
[55:47.700 --> 55:53.420]  against immigrants is so wrong. It's not even funny. First of all, they want to crack down
[55:53.420 --> 55:58.980]  on illegal immigration. So again, let's use the correct terminology. But then for Governor
[55:58.980 --> 56:03.700]  Jerry Brown to say he's initiating a reign of terror, how about the reign of terror you,
[56:03.700 --> 56:08.620]  Jerry Brown, have initiated on the citizens of California with sanctuary cities? How about
[56:08.620 --> 56:13.940]  the reign of terror you, Jerry Brown, have initiated on the state of California with
[56:13.940 --> 56:19.780]  open border policies and with liberal welfare policies that have made California and parts
[56:19.780 --> 56:24.580]  of California look like a third world country? How about you, Jerry Brown, take some of the
[56:24.580 --> 56:29.780]  responsibility for the terror that you have initiated on California? That's you, Jerry
[56:29.780 --> 56:35.420]  Brown, feces covered streets, needle-ridden streets, drug-ridden streets, poverty-ridden
[56:35.420 --> 56:41.060]  streets, homeless-ridden streets. That's on you, Jerry Brown. That's on you. That's not
[56:41.060 --> 56:49.740]  on Jeff Sessions. That's on you. But he'll blame Jeff Sessions. And now California, Trump
[56:49.740 --> 56:56.180]  is going to California next week to visit and address what's going on there with the
[56:56.180 --> 57:01.700]  sanctuary cities. So that's going to be explosive. Oh, this is the story, though. See, this is
[57:01.700 --> 57:05.920]  what happens when you let criminals run the justice system. This is what happens when
[57:05.920 --> 57:12.300]  you let the dregs of society make the rules in society. Hartford police say man drove
[57:12.300 --> 57:20.980]  stolen car to court to face stolen car charge. Do you see how arrogant and wanton these criminals
[57:20.980 --> 57:27.420]  are becoming in this country? Do you see how empowered and entitled non-citizens and criminals
[57:27.420 --> 57:33.020]  are becoming in this country? And how American citizens are being shut down and silenced?
[57:33.020 --> 57:37.860]  That's because of the left. That's because of Democrats. That's because of liberals.
[57:37.860 --> 57:42.780]  That's what you get. You get a third-world country and the hardworking people get shuffled
[57:42.780 --> 57:49.700]  off to the side to pay for the entire thing.

[59:28.140 --> 59:33.340]  maximum potency. They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff, just cover
[59:33.340 --> 59:37.100]  that up for a while, but then burn you out in my experience, whereas stuff that gets
[59:37.100 --> 59:41.460]  your glands naturally going goes right to the source. So it's pretty exciting and I

[59:49.780 --> 59:59.780]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[59:59.780 --> 01:00:10.340]  We're all living in America, America, it's wonderful. We're all living in America.
[01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:16.420]  So California is basically collapsing and Jerry Brown wants to blame Jeff Sessions, who simply
[01:00:16.420 --> 01:00:23.100]  asks that California follow the law. I mean, you can't even make this stuff up. It's so
[01:00:23.100 --> 01:00:29.300]  mad. It's so insane. I can't even believe I have to report on it. What is this twilight
[01:00:29.300 --> 01:00:40.860]  zone going on in California? Well, I mean, it just gets worse. I mean, look at this.
[01:00:40.860 --> 01:00:47.340]  Good water from sewers approved for California taps. Once a Mecca for healthiness, California
[01:00:47.340 --> 01:00:56.140]  continues downward spiral. No, see when pseudo intellectuals and fake liberals run your state,
[01:00:56.140 --> 01:01:01.340]  run your town, they run it directly into the ground because they're all pseudo. They're
[01:01:01.340 --> 01:01:11.260]  fake. They're phonies. They're woozies. They're wazies. They're nothing. I just, I just don't
[01:01:11.260 --> 01:01:17.580]  get it. Why can't people look at California, look at what's happening in California, look
[01:01:17.580 --> 01:01:32.260]  at who runs California and realize those policies don't work. Why are people so stupid? Now,
[01:01:32.260 --> 01:01:39.140]  this is interesting. Let me propose a scenario for you. We've all heard about what's happening
[01:01:39.140 --> 01:01:44.140]  in South Africa. If you're white in South Africa, you're facing genocide, you're losing
[01:01:44.140 --> 01:01:49.220]  your property, and they're basically saying they're coming to kill you. Now, think about
[01:01:49.220 --> 01:01:59.020]  this. Let me propose a scenario for you. Let's just say it reaches that point in South Africa
[01:01:59.020 --> 01:02:02.300]  where whites are just, I mean, it's already happening, honestly, whites are already being
[01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:08.940]  genocided, but let's say it goes just full on slaughter of white people. And that's what
[01:02:08.940 --> 01:02:21.340]  it's on the verge of. And then let's say, so now you've got 10,000 or more white refugees
[01:02:21.340 --> 01:02:29.060]  in South Africa trying to get out. Do we start bringing in white refugees from South Africa
[01:02:29.060 --> 01:02:35.780]  who are facing genocide into America? Do we look at that scenario? And let's say, let's
[01:02:35.780 --> 01:02:41.780]  just say President Trump comes out or someone from the Trump administration comes out and
[01:02:41.780 --> 01:02:48.580]  says, we're going to be taking in X amount of refugees from South Africa because they're
[01:02:48.580 --> 01:02:56.220]  facing genocide. You know what's going to happen. The left is going to freak out. Trump
[01:02:56.220 --> 01:03:00.020]  wants to take white people in. Trump only wants white people. Trump hates Muslims, but
[01:03:00.020 --> 01:03:07.380]  he wants the white people. Oh, yeah. Can you imagine what the liberals would say if anyone
[01:03:07.380 --> 01:03:12.660]  from the Trump administration suggested bringing in white South Africans who are facing genocide
[01:03:12.660 --> 01:03:18.340]  and bringing them in as refugees? Oh, by the way, these are farmers. So they could actually
[01:03:18.340 --> 01:03:23.460]  come here. A lot of them probably may even speak English. So they could come here and
[01:03:23.460 --> 01:03:32.620]  immediately integrate into our society, farm, create jobs. It would actually work. It would
[01:03:32.620 --> 01:03:36.820]  actually make sense instead of bringing in a bunch of people from the Middle East who
[01:03:36.820 --> 01:03:42.460]  don't speak the language, don't care about the culture. In fact, hate the culture. Totally
[01:03:42.460 --> 01:03:47.380]  don't fit in with our society. Don't fit in with our civilization. Instead of bringing
[01:03:47.380 --> 01:03:53.220]  all of them in with no vetting, by the way, where we're bombing all the countries, that
[01:03:53.220 --> 01:04:00.700]  makes sense. That's what the liberals want. But you know, you just, you know it. If Trump
[01:04:00.700 --> 01:04:05.420]  or anyone from the Trump administration suggested bringing in white South Africans facing genocide
[01:04:05.420 --> 01:04:09.660]  as refugees, the liberals would freak out and they would call it racist, even though
[01:04:09.660 --> 01:04:14.660]  it would actually make sense to bring people in that can actually contribute to society,
[01:04:14.660 --> 01:04:22.660]  farm the land, create jobs, speak the language, want to be here, want to be free, are facing
[01:04:22.660 --> 01:04:31.060]  genocide. I think that that is almost a genius move that the Trump administration should
[01:04:31.060 --> 01:04:37.740]  do. Whether or not you actually end up taking in white refugees from South Africa, all you
[01:04:37.740 --> 01:04:43.140]  have to do is float the idea out there just for the liberals to take debate. Imagine the
[01:04:43.140 --> 01:04:48.440]  liberal media for 24 hours after Trump or someone from the Trump administration suggests
[01:04:48.440 --> 01:04:53.340]  taking white refugees from South Africa. Imagine the Democrats the next 24 hours. Folks, that
[01:04:53.340 --> 01:04:57.060]  is a, I'm telling you, that's a brilliant move. Trump should do it.
[01:04:57.060 --> 01:05:02.060]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back
[01:05:02.060 --> 01:05:06.900]  in stock at M4store.com. The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week. I thought
[01:05:06.900 --> 01:05:10.580]  it would be a six-month supply for listeners. And since then, people are beating down our
[01:05:10.580 --> 01:05:15.340]  doors wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue. Research across the board is
[01:05:15.340 --> 01:05:20.100]  clear. In fact, it's certified. When bacteria infect your gums, it can enter your bloodstream
[01:05:20.100 --> 01:05:23.940]  and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks. That's why the last Surgeon General's
[01:05:23.940 --> 01:05:28.280]  report on oral health warns that your oral health can have a serious impact on your
[01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:32.500]  entire body. Super Blue fluoride-free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula that's loaded
[01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:37.340]  with good halogen iodide, some of the bad halogen fluoride. Super Blue contains natural
[01:05:37.340 --> 01:05:41.940]  oils and ingredients used its biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate
[01:05:41.940 --> 01:05:46.480]  bad breath. Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include
[01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:51.980]  silo toll, peppermint oil, iodide, nano silver and more. Learn more about M4Ware's Life

[01:05:58.060 --> 01:06:14.060]  Broadcasting live from the UN Stronghold, Austin, Texas. You're listening to the Alex Jones
[01:06:14.060 --> 01:06:33.940]  Show and now your host, Owen Troyer. Why is it that certain politicians and non-citizens
[01:06:33.940 --> 01:06:40.460]  can get away with crime that an average US citizen could not get away with? You have
[01:06:40.460 --> 01:06:47.700]  to ask yourself, why is that? Who benefits from that? Who funds that? Then you look at
[01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:53.980]  the ACLU, you look at the Democrat Party, you look at Democrat appointed judges and
[01:06:53.980 --> 01:07:00.640]  then you understand the big picture. Then you understand what's actually going on here.
[01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:07.940]  Criminals bringing in more criminals to distract from their own criminal behavior and to get
[01:07:07.940 --> 01:07:16.500]  votes. Now, Alex alluded to this earlier as he's in Colorado, the stories at infowars.com.
[01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:21.100]  Denver Sheriff shields illegal hit and run suspect from ICE deportation. Now, if you
[01:07:21.100 --> 01:07:26.900]  or I was guilty of hit and run, we would face the full extent of the law. We would face
[01:07:26.900 --> 01:07:31.860]  full justice. But if you're a non-citizen, you only get half justice. Here's the report
[01:07:31.860 --> 01:07:39.220]  from the local Fox affiliate in Denver. This cell phone video captures the fiery aftermath
[01:07:39.220 --> 01:07:45.940]  of a deadly hit and run crash at I-70 in I-25. Just an illegal immigrant just burning things
[01:07:45.940 --> 01:07:52.860]  in the street. Ivan Zamaripa Castaneda slammed into a semi-truck killing the driver. Please
[01:07:52.860 --> 01:07:58.620]  say he took off from the scene, but officers later arrested him. Yesterday ICE officers
[01:07:58.620 --> 01:08:06.460]  discovered that suspect is in the United States illegally. Oh, how do you know that? Shocking.
[01:08:06.460 --> 01:08:12.180]  To get him deported back to Mexico. But the Denver Sheriff's Department told me they don't
[01:08:12.180 --> 01:08:18.980]  honor civil detainers, saying their department could be liable for a Fourth Amendment violation.
[01:08:18.980 --> 01:08:24.780]  The Sheriff's Department said... How is that possible? He's not a citizen. How dumb is
[01:08:24.780 --> 01:08:50.580]  the Denver Sheriff's Department? Wow. So now you've got liberals in Denver, liberals
[01:08:50.580 --> 01:08:55.180]  in California standing up for non-citizens before they stand up for veterans, before
[01:08:55.180 --> 01:09:04.900]  they stand up for American citizens. That's what you get. A truck on fire after a non-citizen
[01:09:04.900 --> 01:09:17.660]  crashed into it and killed the driver. But no, thanks to the ACLU and liberal judges,
[01:09:17.660 --> 01:09:28.660]  a non-citizen, guilty of probably manslaughter at least, has a Fourth Amendment right? What's
[01:09:28.660 --> 01:09:34.660]  next? Does he have a Second Amendment right too? Oh, I guarantee you they'll say he has
[01:09:34.660 --> 01:09:39.820]  a Second Amendment right, but the white NRA member doesn't. The white NRA member needs
[01:09:39.820 --> 01:09:45.660]  to turn in his guns, but the illegal that just ran over a guy, killed him and then fled
[01:09:45.660 --> 01:09:49.580]  the scene, he somehow has a Second Amendment right, a Fourth Amendment right, every right
[01:09:49.580 --> 01:09:57.220]  under the sun, thanks to the ACLU, Democrats and liberal judges. Do you see the mental
[01:09:57.220 --> 01:10:01.220]  illness that we're dealing with here? And you just have to wonder, are these people
[01:10:01.220 --> 01:10:06.740]  wantonly just totally hate America? Do these people want to see America destroyed? Are
[01:10:06.740 --> 01:10:12.060]  they that stupid? What is the deal? Are they that big of criminals? What is going on here?
[01:10:12.060 --> 01:10:20.580]  How does the ACLU still operate? The American Civil Liberties Union, the most un-American
[01:10:20.580 --> 01:10:29.220]  team of lawyers you could ever imagine. So that's great. Gosh, I love reporting on that.
[01:10:29.220 --> 01:10:35.820]  It's infuriating. So now, here's Kamala Harris, though. I'm telling you, you know what? I
[01:10:35.820 --> 01:10:40.780]  don't know how much longer I can deal with these people. I'm starting to just, Kamala
[01:10:40.780 --> 01:10:45.620]  Harris now, you know what? Just play. This woman is sick. Just play it. Attorney General
[01:10:45.620 --> 01:10:52.340]  Sessions compared California's actions quite intentionally, I think, to the actions of
[01:10:52.340 --> 01:10:58.780]  the slave states in nullification and secession during the Civil War. What do you say to that?
[01:10:58.780 --> 01:11:07.700]  Indeed. Indeed, he did. Listen, as far as I'm concerned, Jeff Sessions should be advised
[01:11:07.700 --> 01:11:14.580]  and I'll advise him right now that it is a bad idea for him to start talking about anything
[01:11:14.580 --> 01:11:19.660]  to do with the history of slavery or reconstruction or the Civil War in the United States. How
[01:11:19.660 --> 01:11:27.220]  dare he? He's not allowed to. He has no credibility. I'm Kamala Harris. I think Jerry Brown is
[01:11:27.220 --> 01:11:32.620]  absolutely right. This administration and Jeff Sessions... The pause is right here.
[01:11:32.620 --> 01:11:41.820]  CCC, look, look. I'm sorry I'm struggling with this, folks. It's just these people, liars
[01:11:41.820 --> 01:11:47.820]  and phonies like Kamala Harris and Jerry Brown, the fact that they institute policy
[01:11:47.820 --> 01:11:52.940]  and their lawmakers in this country, I mean, it really, it crushes me. It's like a kick
[01:11:52.940 --> 01:11:59.620]  to the groin that these phony, anti-American scumbags run my country. Look at what they've
[01:11:59.620 --> 01:12:06.140]  done to California. And then here's Kamala Harris like, I think Jerry Brown's done a
[01:12:06.140 --> 01:12:11.140]  great job. I love the fact that illegal citizens run this country. I love the state. I love
[01:12:11.140 --> 01:12:14.860]  the fact that the homiest population runs the state. I love the fact we're totally in
[01:12:14.860 --> 01:12:19.620]  debt. I love the fact there's feces in the streets. I love the state of California. Governor
[01:12:19.620 --> 01:12:24.540]  Jerry Brown's done a great job and Jeff Sessions should just shut up even though Alabama seems
[01:12:24.540 --> 01:12:28.860]  to be doing just fine without all the liberal policies. They don't have feces in the streets
[01:12:28.860 --> 01:12:35.300]  and needles everywhere and rampant homelessness. California's doing much better. I'm on Jerry
[01:12:35.300 --> 01:12:39.820]  Brown's team. We're going to destroy the state of California together. And Jeff Sessions
[01:12:39.820 --> 01:12:49.100]  has no credibility. And then Kamala Harris wants to run for president. A total knit.
[01:12:49.100 --> 01:12:54.940]  A total knit. Kamala Harris thinks she can run for president. And that's what the Democrats
[01:12:54.940 --> 01:13:05.180]  have to offer. Let's go back to Kamala Harris, who probably couldn't even read a map. They
[01:13:05.180 --> 01:13:10.260]  put a target on the back of California and California's going to fight. Pause it right
[01:13:10.260 --> 01:13:16.860]  there. Pause it. Pause it. Pause it. Pause it. I'm seriously struggling to report on
[01:13:16.860 --> 01:13:23.700]  this without just screaming and throwing things and breaking things. Jeff Sessions put a target
[01:13:23.700 --> 01:13:28.660]  on the back of California, folks. Jeff Sessions. Excuse me. Was it Jeff Sessions that was
[01:13:28.660 --> 01:13:33.220]  in power when you have piles of feces in the streets? Was it Jeff Sessions that enacted
[01:13:33.220 --> 01:13:39.020]  the clean needle policy? No. Was it Jeff Sessions that instituted the sanctuary city policy
[01:13:39.020 --> 01:13:44.660]  that's led to nothing but crime and violence? No. Was it Jeff Sessions that was the mayor
[01:13:44.660 --> 01:13:50.900]  of Oakland that aided and abetted criminals, at least 800 of them, to get away with crime?
[01:13:50.900 --> 01:13:57.060]  Was that Jeff Sessions? No. Was it Jeff Sessions that shot and killed Kate Steinle and then
[01:13:57.060 --> 01:14:02.100]  got away with it? Nope. Nope. Was it Jeff Sessions that was in charge of California when a homeless
[01:14:02.100 --> 01:14:08.220]  population went through the roofs and now you have homeless tent cities all across the
[01:14:08.220 --> 01:14:13.580]  West Coast of California? Was that Jeff Sessions? No. That was Jerry Brown. That was Kamala
[01:14:13.580 --> 01:14:19.180]  Harris. That was Maxine Waters. That was Nancy Pelosi. That was Diane Feinstein. That was
[01:14:19.180 --> 01:14:25.020]  Adam Schiff. That was Eric Swalwell. That's who it was. And then Kamala Harris says, Jeff
[01:14:25.020 --> 01:14:30.240]  Sessions has put a target on the back of California. Well, you know what, Kamala Harris? Maybe
[01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:34.900]  Jeff Sessions put a target on the back of California because it's become a third-world
[01:14:34.900 --> 01:14:41.420]  hellhole and he wants to clean it up. You, you, Kamala Harris, have defecated with all
[01:14:41.420 --> 01:14:46.740]  your other Democrats and all your liberal judges and the ACLU all over California. So
[01:14:46.740 --> 01:14:51.100]  yes, Sessions put a target on the back of California because you made it a third-world
[01:14:51.100 --> 01:14:57.060]  hellhole and he wants to clean it up and here you are defending it. I want to stay a third-world
[01:14:57.060 --> 01:15:01.580]  hellhole. I want the streets of California to be riddled with violence and crime and
[01:15:01.580 --> 01:15:07.100]  drugs and poverty. That's what the Democrats do. Put me in charge of the country. Go back
[01:15:07.100 --> 01:15:11.140]  to Kamala Harris before my head explodes. Actually, you know what? Just cut her off.
[01:15:11.140 --> 01:15:20.020]  Just cut her off. Okay. Don't you just love it, folks? Don't you just love it? White people
[01:15:20.020 --> 01:15:24.300]  being genocided in Africa. The liberals say nothing. California turns into a third-world
[01:15:24.300 --> 01:15:29.820]  hellhole and the Democrats think it's great. Meanwhile, the New York Police Department
[01:15:29.820 --> 01:15:35.380]  is ready to arrest Harvey Weinstein, one of the big liberal Democrat donors, friends
[01:15:35.380 --> 01:15:40.940]  with the Obamas, friends with the Clintons, ran Hollywood that tries to spout all of their
[01:15:40.940 --> 01:15:46.700]  liberal agenda down our throats. These people are the biggest frauds. You know what it is?
[01:15:46.700 --> 01:15:51.580]  This is why America loves Infowars because we are done with frauds. We're done being
[01:15:51.580 --> 01:15:55.300]  run by frauds. We're done with the country being run by frauds. We're done with frauds
[01:15:55.300 --> 01:16:00.620]  in the media. I'm just done with all the frauds. Hey, this is Ricky from Banion Hill. You like

[01:17:27.340 --> 01:17:32.380]  Hear that? That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the
[01:17:32.380 --> 01:17:36.820]  place. And what they don't steal will be destroyed.

[01:17:58.620 --> 01:18:03.020]  You know, someone very profoundly once said many years ago that if fascism ever comes to
[01:18:03.020 --> 01:18:12.020]  America, it'll come in the name of liberalism. You're a white male! You're a white man!

[01:19:57.100 --> 01:20:19.100]  in FullWarsLife.com. Here's a crazy notion. I want to live in the greatest, most prosperous
[01:20:19.100 --> 01:20:24.460]  country on earth with the highest standard of living. Oh, here I am in the United States
[01:20:24.460 --> 01:20:32.460]  of America. Wow. But the Democrats and the liberals are trying to destroy it all. Just
[01:20:32.460 --> 01:20:39.140]  look at California. And that's why I get so mad when I have to cover California and cover
[01:20:39.140 --> 01:20:44.780]  liars and phonies like Jerry Brown and Kamala Harris because everywhere people like them
[01:20:44.780 --> 01:20:52.700]  go, they leave total destruction and annihilation of culture, of finance, of civilization, of
[01:20:52.700 --> 01:21:00.460]  infrastructure, and they want to run everywhere. They're authoritarians and their total failures.
[01:21:00.460 --> 01:21:08.060]  Their policies fail every time. But I'm going to try to divulge from that so that I'm not
[01:21:08.060 --> 01:21:13.260]  screaming at the audience all day long because I know that tends to be an issue for me when
[01:21:13.260 --> 01:21:17.860]  I cover this stuff. So let's switch tracks. And I'm also going to go to the audience here
[01:21:17.860 --> 01:21:22.900]  and open up the phone lines momentarily too. Maybe the audience can try to calm me down.
[01:21:22.900 --> 01:21:31.220]  You're starting to hear more echoes in D.C., in the Hill, in the White House, in the Senate,
[01:21:31.220 --> 01:21:38.380]  in the House, everywhere about a second special counsel, Trey Gowdy, Ron DeSantis, Devin Nunes,
[01:21:38.380 --> 01:21:43.660]  Matt Gaetz, Warren Hats, Chuck Grassley. And they're all suggesting we have to have a second
[01:21:43.660 --> 01:21:47.820]  counsel. We have to have a second counsel. We need more people interviewed. There's bias in this
[01:21:47.820 --> 01:21:51.900]  counsel. There's bias in the FBI. All we can do is have the second counsel. And they're all
[01:21:51.900 --> 01:22:02.220]  signaling to Jeff Sessions like, Sessions, second counsel, please, where are you? Well, it looks
[01:22:02.220 --> 01:22:08.620]  like Sessions has pulled the potatoes out of his ears and is finally hearing them as he is
[01:22:08.620 --> 01:22:15.300]  apparently seriously considering it. Here's a report on Fox. Well, I have great respect for
[01:22:15.300 --> 01:22:21.900]  Mr. Gowdy and Chairman Goodlatt. And we're going to consider seriously their recommendations. I
[01:22:21.900 --> 01:22:27.780]  have appointed a person outside of Washington many years in the Department of Justice to look at
[01:22:27.780 --> 01:22:33.180]  all the allegations that the House Judiciary Committee members sent to us. And we're conducting
[01:22:33.180 --> 01:22:40.300]  that investigation. I also am well aware that we have a responsibility to ensure the integrity of
[01:22:40.300 --> 01:22:46.380]  the FISA process. We're not afraid to look at that. The Inspector General, something that our
[01:22:46.380 --> 01:22:55.100]  Inspector General is not very strong, but he has almost 500 employees, most of which are lawyers
[01:22:55.100 --> 01:23:02.140]  and prosecutors. He just doubted his impartiality. At the FISA process, we must make sure it's done
[01:23:02.140 --> 01:23:06.700]  properly. And we're going to do that. And I'll consider their request.
[01:23:07.420 --> 01:23:12.220]  All right then. Let's hope he's serious about that. And let's hope he's not just considering it,
[01:23:12.220 --> 01:23:18.380]  but is going to give us a second counsel. Because as President Trump has said, the crimes
[01:23:19.180 --> 01:23:23.340]  and everything that's been going on with Hillary Clinton and the emails and Benghazi,
[01:23:23.340 --> 01:23:28.780]  it's unbelievable. And then the Obama FISA scandal is bigger than Watergate. So yeah,
[01:23:28.780 --> 01:23:34.060]  let's get something going. Please, Jeff Sessions, we're begging you. We are begging you to do
[01:23:34.060 --> 01:23:38.060]  something about these criminals that have infiltrated our government and that are still
[01:23:38.060 --> 01:23:42.220]  walking free. Every day that Hillary Clinton walks free, I lose a little more patience.
[01:23:42.220 --> 01:23:49.340]  Now, just to show you, just to show you how out of touch with reality and warped the mind
[01:23:49.340 --> 01:23:56.460]  of an average liberal is, let me break this down for you. Okay. Now, I covered the collapse of
[01:23:56.460 --> 01:24:01.900]  Hollywood and the movie industry yesterday. There's many reasons for that. But you better believe
[01:24:02.700 --> 01:24:09.340]  that liberals in Hollywood have done it to themselves. Yes, Netflix is part of the reason
[01:24:09.340 --> 01:24:14.620]  why movie sales are down. But it's not the whole story. A lot of it has to do with liberals
[01:24:14.620 --> 01:24:18.060]  espousing their politics, and then people don't want to go pay to see them in the theater.
[01:24:18.060 --> 01:24:26.620]  Here's the most recent example. A wrinkle in time, latest mega million dollar movie,
[01:24:27.260 --> 01:24:33.740]  huge cast, big advertisement push. You see it everywhere. A wrinkle in time starring Oprah.
[01:24:35.020 --> 01:24:40.540]  Well, a wrinkle in time has totally flopped at the box office. A total failure, a total bust,
[01:24:40.540 --> 01:24:50.460]  a wrinkle in time. Again, starring Oprah. A wrinkle in time starring Oprah fails in the box office.
[01:24:52.140 --> 01:24:59.100]  Now, what is also happening at the same time? People are pushing Oprah to run for president.
[01:25:01.100 --> 01:25:06.300]  Do you see the disconnect here? Ladies and gentlemen, Oprah can't even sell a movie.
[01:25:06.300 --> 01:25:13.580]  She can't even sell a children's movie. Do you think she can win a presidential election?
[01:25:15.100 --> 01:25:22.140]  Please, I beg you to nominate Oprah. Oprah doesn't have a chance. Now look, Oprah will get
[01:25:22.140 --> 01:25:26.860]  the dumb down liberal vote. Of course she will. She'll get all of the dumb down liberal votes.
[01:25:26.860 --> 01:25:35.420]  That's a given. That's fine. But most Americans aren't dumb down liberals. And I've got news for
[01:25:35.420 --> 01:25:42.700]  you too. Most dumb down liberals don't even vote. So good luck with that strategy.
[01:25:43.900 --> 01:25:51.020]  But they're moving forward. CBS urges Oprah to run against Trump. You heal and connect all people.
[01:25:51.020 --> 01:25:59.180]  Again, a woman that can't even sell a movie they think can run for president. Here is CBS
[01:25:59.180 --> 01:26:07.020]  promoting or prompting Oprah to run for president. One of the things that, as we were saying before,
[01:26:07.020 --> 01:26:10.220]  the break is that there are a lot of people out there who like to see you be president of the
[01:26:10.220 --> 01:26:19.340]  United States. This guy's their propaganda man. Oprah, we've been honored by that. It just isn't
[01:26:19.340 --> 01:26:26.460]  something. I've said this before. I would know it. I mean, it would be, you know, everybody's
[01:26:26.460 --> 01:26:33.180]  saying it. I am very much in touch with my inner GPS. And let's pause it right here for a second.
[01:26:33.180 --> 01:26:37.020]  Let's pause it right here for a second. Let's give Oprah the respect that she's do. I mean,
[01:26:37.020 --> 01:26:42.060]  this is a very successful woman. Okay. I mean, she knows how to get rich. She knows how to build a
[01:26:42.060 --> 01:26:46.220]  business empire, even though her television network totally failed. Other than that, she's
[01:26:46.220 --> 01:26:51.740]  pretty much been a success, you know, as far as her business life is concerned her whole life.
[01:26:51.740 --> 01:26:56.540]  So this is a woman who wouldn't run for president unless she thought she's going to win. I don't
[01:26:56.540 --> 01:27:02.220]  think Oprah's stupid. I think Oprah knows that she can't beat Trump. So she's not going to run in 2020.
[01:27:02.220 --> 01:27:05.980]  Now, maybe she thinks she can beat someone in 2024 or maybe something down the road.
[01:27:05.980 --> 01:27:10.940]  But I think this is why this is why Oprah kind of flirts with the idea and kind of plays,
[01:27:10.940 --> 01:27:16.060]  plays patty cake with it. Because she knows that she can't beat Trump, but she likes the notion and
[01:27:16.060 --> 01:27:19.820]  having it out there. And she's a smart business woman. It's good publicity. But I don't think
[01:27:19.820 --> 01:27:23.420]  she would ever put herself in a position to lose an election. That's why I don't think she'll run.
[01:27:25.260 --> 01:27:29.500]  You know what? All right, go ahead and finish that clip.
[01:27:30.220 --> 01:27:34.380]  Yeah, the voice of God. In fact, you said in, again, People Magazine, if I have this quote,
[01:27:34.380 --> 01:27:40.460]  right, you said, if God, if you think I'm supposed to run, you got to tell me, and it has to be so
[01:27:40.460 --> 01:27:47.580]  clear, so clear, even I can miss it. That's right. That's right. So have you, but they make fun of,
[01:27:47.580 --> 01:27:52.060]  they make fun of Mike Pence when he says he speaks to God, he's the bad guy. But Oprah,
[01:27:52.060 --> 01:27:55.660]  it's okay for her to invoke God. You know, that those are all people outside you,
[01:27:55.660 --> 01:27:59.420]  you know what that is. If a thousand people tell you to do something, but you don't feel it inside
[01:27:59.420 --> 01:28:03.340]  yourself, or if a thousand people say, oh, you know, you can't win. You know, it doesn't.
[01:28:05.260 --> 01:28:11.980]  You know, you can't win. You know, it doesn't. So no, I haven't. Okay. Well, I guess, I guess that
[01:28:11.980 --> 01:28:20.540]  settles it. Yeah. Oprah, Stephen, what's up? Hey. Okay. So now CBS projects the image of God
[01:28:21.100 --> 01:28:24.780]  on top of the studio to invoke Oprah to run for president. Look at this.
[01:28:24.780 --> 01:28:30.460]  Apologize. I apologize. God stops by every once in a while. He's a fan. Can I, can I help you,
[01:28:30.460 --> 01:28:35.580]  Lord? I'm kind of the middle of talking to somebody important. Oh, I know Stephen. I'm a huge fan.
[01:28:35.580 --> 01:28:42.540]  That's great to hear. I'm a big fan of yours too, God. Oh, but Mike Pence is crazy when he talks
[01:28:42.540 --> 01:28:48.540]  about God. Trump is crazy when he talks about God. Here's CBS literally invoking God, putting an
[01:28:48.540 --> 01:28:53.500]  image of God, a projection of God on the studio while Colbert is interviewing Oprah to get her to
[01:28:53.500 --> 01:28:58.220]  run for president. These people have lost their minds. They've lost their minds. It's a no-brainer.

[01:32:03.100 --> 01:32:07.900]  Thank you sir for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America
[01:32:07.900 --> 01:32:12.460]  and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[01:32:12.460 --> 01:32:19.980]  And as a longtime InfoWar's listener I want to say thanks for the awesome BrainForce Anthroplex.
[01:32:19.980 --> 01:32:24.540]  My girlfriend would like to say thanks for the Anthroplex too. Thank you. I use the Biotru Selenium,
[01:32:24.540 --> 01:32:29.180]  the super blue toothpaste for you folks who aren't big normal toothpaste fans. The super blue is
[01:32:29.180 --> 01:32:34.380]  awesome and thank you so much Alex for the InfoWar'sLife products. They are quality.
[01:32:34.380 --> 01:32:39.100]  I can't wait to get some more and thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy.
[01:32:39.100 --> 01:32:45.500]  Absolutely. Because then we could all as educated patriots help our other countrymen and women
[01:32:45.500 --> 01:32:50.300]  understand that there's a bigger problems going on and if we can get our houses in order
[01:32:50.300 --> 01:33:09.500]  and be good to each other and ourselves we can take our country back. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:33:09.500 --> 01:33:25.100]  You found it. The tip of the spear. It is the Alex Jones show with Owen Troyer.
[01:33:25.100 --> 01:33:42.780]  Well here's the story folks. We are under constant censorship, constant attack
[01:33:43.980 --> 01:33:50.220]  and the liberal media is behind a lot of it whether it's the Southern Poverty Law Center or
[01:33:50.220 --> 01:33:57.740]  Mother Jones or even CNN constantly trying to demonize us, dehumanize us, attack us,
[01:33:57.740 --> 01:34:05.260]  lie about us and then have us shut down. But because Alex Jones created an independent
[01:34:05.260 --> 01:34:12.700]  platform here and made the InfoWar store we can remain independent. So even if they try to shut
[01:34:12.700 --> 01:34:19.260]  us down and silence us thanks to you we can still operate and remain independent and you're supported
[01:34:19.260 --> 01:34:23.900]  InfoWarStore.com makes that possible. So we've got huge specials running right now. In fact
[01:34:24.940 --> 01:34:30.940]  this is actually week two of these specials. So I doubt that these get extended into week three.
[01:34:30.940 --> 01:34:35.820]  So take advantage of all the specials right now at InfoWarStore.com before they come to an end.
[01:34:36.940 --> 01:34:43.900]  I would guess by Sunday sometimes Alex tends to just let these things run on and just kind of
[01:34:43.900 --> 01:34:48.700]  let him go off the rails before he shuts them down just because he wants you to try the products
[01:34:48.700 --> 01:34:54.220]  out at a great price. But my guess is this probably can't last much past Sunday. So I would make sure
[01:34:54.220 --> 01:34:58.700]  to get to the InfoWarStore.com today and take advantage of these specials including free shipping
[01:34:58.700 --> 01:35:07.100]  store wide. Free shipping store wide. Now for big ticket items like emergency food and air filters

[01:36:41.100 --> 01:36:47.500]  defeat the fake news. That's why CNN wants us shut down. That's why News Corp wants us shut down
[01:36:47.500 --> 01:36:53.900]  because we're defeating them. They can't survive with us as competition. So they have to shut us
[01:36:53.900 --> 01:37:03.020]  down. That's a Nazi technique. So help InfoWars defeat the Nazis at CNN by going to InfoWarStore.com.
[01:37:03.020 --> 01:37:09.500]  All right. I've gotten a little angry here today having to cover the liberal nonsense in California.
[01:37:09.500 --> 01:37:15.820]  So I'm going to give out the phone line now and we'll let the audience kind of talk me back off
[01:37:15.820 --> 01:37:27.580]  the ledge here. The phone number is 1-877-789-2539. 1-877-789-ALEX. Now specifically with Brad Parscale,
[01:37:27.580 --> 01:37:30.540]  guys, let's actually try to screen some of these calls today.
[01:37:30.540 --> 01:37:44.140]  Because I want to talk about really this as the biggest story. But what do we do? I guess here's
[01:37:44.140 --> 01:37:52.780]  what I want to hear from the audience today. What do we do about the bias, the censorship,
[01:37:54.140 --> 01:38:00.220]  the Nazi style rollout of their quote unquote public forum that's not really public. It's
[01:38:00.220 --> 01:38:05.820]  totally biased, totally slanted at Facebook, Twitter and Google. What do we do? What should
[01:38:05.820 --> 01:38:11.260]  the Trump administration do? What do you think Brad Parscale is warning when he says we're
[01:38:11.260 --> 01:38:16.460]  watching you? What do you think the answer to this is? That's one topic you can call in today on.
[01:38:17.020 --> 01:38:22.540]  Brad Parscale's tweets warning big tech. What do you think about that? What do we do about that?
[01:38:22.540 --> 01:38:25.740]  What do we do moving forward? So that's one topic, guys, when screening these calls.
[01:38:25.740 --> 01:38:33.740]  The other topic you've got, and I'm going to go to this clip. Because of the tariffs,
[01:38:33.740 --> 01:38:37.500]  and I've heard arguments both ways, I'm not going to act like the expert. I'm going to say
[01:38:38.140 --> 01:38:43.660]  I'm willing to give Trump a chance on this and see if he can deliver. And it does appear he's
[01:38:43.660 --> 01:38:48.380]  already delivering. Now we'll see what happens if a quote unquote trade war happens. But
[01:38:50.060 --> 01:38:55.180]  you have had steel plants reopening, aluminum plants reopening. I've had callers call into
[01:38:55.180 --> 01:39:00.220]  the war room that I normally host with Roger Stone from 3 to 6 p.m. at infowars.com slash show.
[01:39:01.340 --> 01:39:06.860]  I've had callers call in from Pennsylvania saying, yeah, we are now opening the steel plants again.
[01:39:06.860 --> 01:39:11.180]  We're now back to work. I actually, he was, I had a guy call and say, I used to work full
[01:39:11.180 --> 01:39:15.340]  time over time and then I got slashed to nothing during the Obama years. Now I'm back working
[01:39:15.340 --> 01:39:20.540]  over time. We're hiring more people. So the two subjects I want to take calls on today.
[01:39:20.540 --> 01:39:26.300]  What do you take from Brad Parskill's tweet warning big tech about censorship? And then two,
[01:39:27.180 --> 01:39:33.180]  are you a steel worker? Are you a steel worker in Ohio? Are you a steel worker in Pennsylvania?
[01:39:33.180 --> 01:39:37.180]  Have you worked in the steel plants before? Have you seen the steel plants get shut down?
[01:39:37.180 --> 01:39:42.460]  Now are you seeing them come back? So I want to hear specifically from people in steel country,
[01:39:42.460 --> 01:39:47.740]  from people that manufacture steel and aluminum. What do you think about this? Are you seeing the
[01:39:47.740 --> 01:39:52.300]  rejuvenation of American manufacturing? Are you seeing the steel industry coming back?
[01:39:52.300 --> 01:39:57.420]  Those are the two topics specifically I want to hear about today. So either someone working in
[01:39:57.420 --> 01:40:03.020]  steel country with experience in the steel country or what do you think about Brad Parskill's tweet
[01:40:03.020 --> 01:40:09.020]  and what do we do about the censorship from big tech guys? Those are the two subjects I want
[01:40:09.020 --> 01:40:12.780]  today. So we're going to kind of be screening your calls. I want to only talk about those two
[01:40:12.780 --> 01:40:17.740]  things. Now we're aggregating your calls right now. Again, the Wall Street Journal. Some steel and
[01:40:17.740 --> 01:40:23.420]  aluminum makers to restart plant operation amid tariff plans. Boom, rejuvenating American
[01:40:23.420 --> 01:40:31.660]  manufacturing. Don Salazar, infowars.com. Trump Effect. US Steel reopens plant, brings back 500
[01:40:31.660 --> 01:40:37.900]  jobs. And here is the CEO of US Steel on CNBC, crediting Trump with their reopening.
[01:40:37.900 --> 01:40:44.540]  We're really excited to be able to tell our employees in the community in Granite City,
[01:40:44.540 --> 01:40:50.700]  Illinois that we will be calling back 500 employees. This feels like the beginning
[01:40:50.700 --> 01:40:56.940]  of a renaissance for us. We're finally doing the right thing for American workers after decades,
[01:40:56.940 --> 01:41:03.100]  decades of unfairly traded steel into the United States. So we're really happy and delighted to
[01:41:03.100 --> 01:41:09.020]  share with everybody that we're getting back on track after so many years. Mr. Burr, at the Granite
[01:41:09.020 --> 01:41:14.540]  City facilities had been idled since December of 2015. What happened? What caused the idling?
[01:41:15.260 --> 01:41:21.500]  Well, it's the unfair trade. If you don't have customers here to sell to and you can't make
[01:41:21.500 --> 01:41:27.580]  money, you have to shut them down. And we've seen our facilities go from 15 facilities here in the
[01:41:27.580 --> 01:41:33.660]  most recent years down to seven. That's what Obama did. That was stopping the American manufacturing
[01:41:33.660 --> 01:41:39.660]  industry, stopping American prosperity. A value of a billion dollars, a market capitalization
[01:41:39.660 --> 01:41:45.900]  of a billion dollars. And in January of 2016, we're actually less than a billion dollars.
[01:41:45.900 --> 01:41:51.820]  And here we are working hard every day trying to get the things back on track. And we finally get
[01:41:51.820 --> 01:41:56.620]  some good news because we got some courageous leadership in the administration and big, big
[01:41:56.620 --> 01:42:02.140]  thanks to Commerce Secretary Ross and certainly President Trump for taking the leadership and
[01:42:02.140 --> 01:42:07.580]  righting some wrongs. It's really important that we get this right and finally it's happening.
[01:42:07.580 --> 01:42:12.060]  One more very quick question. What we've heard in the pushback from people on the opposite side
[01:42:12.060 --> 01:42:17.340]  of this issue this week has been that, look, the jobs aren't going to come back regardless,
[01:42:17.340 --> 01:42:23.500]  that so much has been automated in the steel industry and in the aluminum industry. What do
[01:42:23.500 --> 01:42:26.940]  you say that? Nothing can replace American grit and American hard work. All right, we got to go
[01:42:26.940 --> 01:42:30.860]  to a break here. On the other side, we'll start taking your calls. But folks, this is Trump fulfilling
[01:42:30.860 --> 01:42:36.780]  his promise. This is Trump bringing back American manufacturing, rejuvenating American manufacturing,
[01:42:36.780 --> 01:42:42.540]  making us more reliant and independent or less reliant on other steel, more independent and
[01:42:42.540 --> 01:42:48.460]  reliant on our own manufactured goods. And they always spin, oh, it'll never work. There's no magic
[01:42:48.460 --> 01:42:53.100]  jobs won. And then Trump just delivers stock markets up, American manufacturing back, steel,
[01:42:53.100 --> 01:42:55.980]  plants back. Your call is on the other side. This is the Alex Jones show.
[01:42:57.660 --> 01:43:02.780]  They use their media to assassinate real news. They use their schools to teach children that
[01:43:02.780 --> 01:43:08.140]  their president is another Hitler. They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and
[01:43:08.140 --> 01:43:14.060]  award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again. And then they use their ex-president to
[01:43:14.060 --> 01:43:20.700]  endorse the resistance all to make them march, make them protest, make them scream racism and
[01:43:20.700 --> 01:43:26.940]  sexism and xenophobia and homophobia to smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and
[01:43:26.940 --> 01:43:33.180]  airports, bully and terrorize the law abiding until the only option left is for the police to do
[01:43:33.180 --> 01:43:39.260]  their jobs and stop the madness. And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their
[01:43:39.260 --> 01:43:47.020]  outrage. The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom is to fight
[01:43:47.020 --> 01:43:54.380]  this violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth. I'm the National Rifle Association of America
[01:43:54.380 --> 01:43:59.420]  and I'm Freedom's safest place. Fuel your body with carnivore, the new digestive
[01:43:59.420 --> 01:44:04.940]  enzyme product by Infowars Life. Digestive enzymes assist in the digestive process and increase the
[01:44:04.940 --> 01:44:09.980]  bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components. They also
[01:44:09.980 --> 01:44:13.980]  help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in
[01:44:13.980 --> 01:44:18.780]  the gut. Digestive enzyme production declines as we age. Carnivore is filled with digestive
[01:44:18.780 --> 01:44:23.900]  enzymes like those naturally present in the body. Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods
[01:44:23.900 --> 01:44:29.500]  again. You can eat protein-heavy foods now while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort
[01:44:29.500 --> 01:44:34.700]  commonly associated with high meat diets. Just one pill with every high protein meal helps increase
[01:44:34.700 --> 01:44:39.260]  the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[01:44:39.260 --> 01:44:44.620]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates,
[01:44:44.620 --> 01:44:50.380]  so you can fully digest all types of meals. Don't let a meal go to waste. Use carnivore by Infowars

[01:44:58.140 --> 01:45:04.620]  Introducing Cell Force by Infowars Life. Cell Force focuses on mitochondria efficiency and
[01:45:04.620 --> 01:45:11.420]  protection. Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy. They are your body's cellular engines.
[01:45:11.420 --> 01:45:16.140]  Cell Force helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria,
[01:45:16.140 --> 01:45:21.340]  much like a cellular engine overhaul. Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100%
[01:45:21.340 --> 01:45:27.500]  efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species. Top scientists agree that aging
[01:45:27.500 --> 01:45:32.780]  is most likely caused by cellular damage, resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[01:45:32.780 --> 01:45:38.620]  The antioxidants found in Cell Force are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[01:45:38.620 --> 01:45:43.660]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen
[01:45:43.660 --> 01:45:51.180]  species and other free radicals. Boost, protect, and adapt with Cell Force from Infowars Life.
[01:45:51.180 --> 01:45:59.660]  Head to InfowarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139. After years of research working with top
[01:45:59.660 --> 01:46:05.260]  developers here in the United States with the latest cutting-edge science, we are rolling out
[01:46:05.260 --> 01:46:13.180]  three new digestive gut aids. One of them is a powerful pro-digestive enzyme, carnivore,
[01:46:13.180 --> 01:46:18.220]  for being able to break down meat and other proteins better. And then the other two is a

[01:46:57.180 --> 01:47:04.060]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:47:16.220 --> 01:47:21.980]  All right we're about to go to your phone calls here before I'm joined by Leanne McAdoo in the
[01:47:21.980 --> 01:47:28.060]  third hour. Before I do though I'm going to be taking your calls on Brad Parsgill's tweets
[01:47:29.580 --> 01:47:36.540]  or his tweet warning big tech. Again I mentioned this last segment Jeff Sessions seriously considering
[01:47:36.540 --> 01:47:43.420]  second special counsel. Hey Jeff stop seriously considering it and do it. I'm giving you credit
[01:47:43.420 --> 01:47:48.220]  this week you've been alive you have a pulse you've you've you've woken from your comatose.
[01:47:48.220 --> 01:47:54.140]  Now let's start moving forward with some of this. Get the special counsel the second one
[01:47:55.580 --> 01:48:00.540]  and and let's let's start jailing some of these politicians that are breaking the law like Libby
[01:48:00.540 --> 01:48:13.500]  Schaff. All right real quick this is just wild and I suspect the the Fox News of the world will
[01:48:13.500 --> 01:48:19.100]  be all over this tonight so we'll let this kind of stew and we'll see what comes of it but you
[01:48:19.100 --> 01:48:26.620]  probably heard about the poisoned Russian spy. Well it turns out Sergei Skripal I don't know
[01:48:26.620 --> 01:48:30.300]  if I'm saying that right uh Russia Putin am I saying that right Putin how do I say that
[01:48:32.300 --> 01:48:41.900]  uh Putin Putin guys I've been abandoned by Putin here thank you Putin. Sergei Skripal
[01:48:41.900 --> 01:48:48.780]  was close to consultant who was linked to the Trump dossier. Now how do we know that because
[01:48:48.780 --> 01:48:57.740]  as far as I know Christopher Steele has not given the identity of his Russian sources so
[01:48:57.740 --> 01:49:03.580]  Christopher Steele colluded with Russia to make up the fake narrative that Trump colluded with
[01:49:03.580 --> 01:49:08.700]  Russia. I mean you can't make this stuff up unless you're in the twilight zone and now you've got
[01:49:08.700 --> 01:49:15.260]  this poisoned spy this Russian spy Sergei Skripal and I'm sitting here and I'm like how do we know
[01:49:15.260 --> 01:49:20.460]  he wasn't one of the sources how do we know this man wasn't one of the sources for the Trump dossier
[01:49:21.100 --> 01:49:25.580]  and like all these other Russians right now just totally trolled the United States media.
[01:49:27.260 --> 01:49:31.260]  It's like Russians have the greatest sense of humor right now it's like everything is just a joke
[01:49:31.260 --> 01:49:36.380]  to them like US media is such a joke to them US politics is such a joke to them they just call
[01:49:36.380 --> 01:49:45.900]  up politicians and prank call them so but this this Russian spy gets poisoned how do I know
[01:49:45.900 --> 01:49:51.740]  he wasn't one of the consultants directly Christopher Steele went to maybe they had to
[01:49:53.020 --> 01:50:04.380]  you know rub him out. Seth Rich style to try to hide their crimes once again so I have a
[01:50:04.380 --> 01:50:08.780]  feeling that that's going to stew and something more is going to come of that but but I'll just
[01:50:08.780 --> 01:50:17.020]  leave that out there for you to chew on. Let's go out to the phone lines now. Where should we go
[01:50:17.020 --> 01:50:23.820]  first? Let's go to Corey calling in from Pennsylvania a truck driver in Steele country go ahead Corey.
[01:50:24.780 --> 01:50:30.940]  Hey how you doing today? Doing good what have you seen differently since Trump has become president
[01:50:30.940 --> 01:50:38.220]  out there in Steele country? Hey you know what Corey Corey I'm sorry to interrupt you but
[01:50:38.220 --> 01:50:41.500]  are you on a speakerphone or something can you can you get off that we're having trouble hearing you.
[01:50:46.220 --> 01:50:50.620]  This is great national talk radio here. Hey sorry about that my friend. All right go ahead.
[01:50:51.660 --> 01:50:58.380]  So what I've been seeing is not only just in the the industrial side but by the retail and
[01:50:58.380 --> 01:51:03.340]  manufacturing side as well for the freight rates across the floor have been increasing under the
[01:51:03.340 --> 01:51:08.380]  current administration. So it's not just the steel industry in general but the whole trucking
[01:51:08.380 --> 01:51:14.140]  industry is coming up. It's been down for a little while there are a huge shortage of drivers but
[01:51:14.140 --> 01:51:18.460]  it's not just drivers it's also with the pay side so pay starting to come up and the qualified
[01:51:18.460 --> 01:51:25.740]  drivers are making more money. So you're saying your experience as a truck driver you're saying
[01:51:25.740 --> 01:51:32.140]  you've seen in that industry wages going up more work opportunities being made available
[01:51:32.140 --> 01:51:38.300]  and more American manufacturing being shipped using the trucking industry. Oh absolutely well
[01:51:38.300 --> 01:51:45.420]  I'm hearing the heart of an R.D. so we're just been not so busy and getting better so I'm not
[01:51:45.420 --> 01:51:51.260]  complaining that's for sure. And wouldn't you say I mean I would say that based on what we've seen
[01:51:51.260 --> 01:51:59.180]  so far Trump should have Ohio and Pennsylvania locked up for 2020. I would hope so. I was very happy
[01:51:59.180 --> 01:52:04.140]  with the win there during the election process. There was a little nerve-wracking in the last
[01:52:04.140 --> 01:52:10.940]  few hours but we saw a record turnout just in my little town. Kind of like 3,000 people and
[01:52:11.500 --> 01:52:17.580]  two birds with a town actually counted. Well I think it's only going to get better and the more
[01:52:17.580 --> 01:52:22.060]  jobs return the more manufacturing returns I think more people are going to come over to Trump
[01:52:22.060 --> 01:52:27.100]  because more people are going to benefit from the industry, from the job market expanding,
[01:52:27.100 --> 01:52:32.460]  from the pay wages going up. Thank you for the call Corey. Let's now jump over to Michael in
[01:52:32.460 --> 01:52:38.700]  Michigan. He wants to talk about the solution to Twitter and Facebook basically centering
[01:52:38.700 --> 01:52:47.980]  conservatives. Go ahead Michael. Hey Owen thanks for taking my call. So what's on your mind?
[01:52:50.140 --> 01:52:58.940]  My solution to the to the Twitter, Twitter, Facebook, Interference is back when I was a kid
[01:53:00.780 --> 01:53:07.420]  when the president spoke on spoke. All the TV stations had nothing but the president speaking.
[01:53:07.420 --> 01:53:11.740]  Everything was shut down. It was nothing but the president speaking. They should do that today.
[01:53:11.740 --> 01:53:17.980]  We have the emergency broadcast system that the president could take over and when he has news
[01:53:17.980 --> 01:53:23.500]  to put out to the people not just the conservatives but if he was able to use the emergency broadcasting
[01:53:23.500 --> 01:53:30.220]  system on the radio and TV his message would get out to everyone. I think I understand what
[01:53:30.220 --> 01:53:33.020]  you're saying. Well I do understand what you're saying but are you saying he needs to do this
[01:53:33.020 --> 01:53:38.620]  like all the time or maybe just hit it once where he just goes in and goes over all the broadcast
[01:53:38.620 --> 01:53:44.060]  networks and is just like hey look there's serious censorship going on on these platforms that you
[01:53:44.060 --> 01:53:52.380]  need to be aware of to just force it out into you know the mainstream? Yeah once a month you know
[01:53:52.380 --> 01:53:56.860]  that's all that would be needed and that's kind of what he does with his Twitter account but
[01:53:56.860 --> 01:54:03.340]  you're saying take it one step further and basically kind of just just force it out there. Force it
[01:54:03.340 --> 01:54:09.980]  out there yeah and another thing when when Trump's uh renegotiating this after he needs to keep
[01:54:10.540 --> 01:54:16.780]  Canadian trash in Canada instead of littering all of Michigan with it. Canada keeps none of their
[01:54:16.780 --> 01:54:22.780]  trash. We take it all in Michigan. What do you guys have like big incinerators or something up there?
[01:54:22.780 --> 01:54:29.740]  No they use their lands all their landfills. Canada has all the land all the land possible
[01:54:29.740 --> 01:54:36.460]  up there and we take all their trash. Interesting interesting that sounds like a local issue I'm
[01:54:36.460 --> 01:54:40.220]  not too aware of that but um an interesting issue to bring up thank you for the call Michael.
[01:54:40.940 --> 01:54:45.580]  Speaking of Canada let's go to Jeff calling from Vancouver Island go ahead Jeff.
[01:54:45.580 --> 01:54:53.740]  Hey Owen thanks for taking my call. I just want to say um the topic I called in on was
[01:54:54.780 --> 01:54:59.660]  righteous economics and I think you know Trump has got so many plates spinning with
[01:54:59.660 --> 01:55:05.580]  so many different issues that I think you know the perspective from the north I think you guys
[01:55:05.580 --> 01:55:11.180]  really have to trust that he is doing the right thing and you know just I was just thinking of
[01:55:11.180 --> 01:55:17.260]  Alex taking a week off with his family you know economically it might not make sense but you know
[01:55:17.260 --> 01:55:21.900]  for the health of his family it makes sense so I have to trust that that Trump does see the big
[01:55:21.900 --> 01:55:31.180]  picture he's got so many people working on that and that just let let time prove that this is
[01:55:31.180 --> 01:55:36.700]  right because I think he's got a righteous stance on the country I think he's got a you know he's
[01:55:36.700 --> 01:55:43.660]  got a team of people that that pray for him that's really encouraging to see and and just know that
[01:55:43.660 --> 01:55:50.780]  it's going to bear fruit and it seems like every every time he does something that looks a bit off
[01:55:50.780 --> 01:55:57.420]  it always seems to come around so I just want to put that out. Well and to me I'm not an expert on
[01:55:57.420 --> 01:56:03.180]  tariffs or the seal industry or anything like that I go just I go based off what I see what I read
[01:56:03.180 --> 01:56:08.460]  and there's pretty much experts on both sides of the aisle with this issue some saying yes these
[01:56:08.460 --> 01:56:12.540]  tariffs will benefit others saying no these tariffs are bad so I'm just sitting here neutral in the
[01:56:12.540 --> 01:56:17.100]  middle saying look I trust Trump's instincts I think that he wants to do what's best for this
[01:56:17.100 --> 01:56:23.580]  country so I'm willing to to see what happens with this new initiative with these new tariffs
[01:56:23.580 --> 01:56:28.860]  to try to bring steel manufacturing back and he actually was speaking today before a meeting when
[01:56:28.860 --> 01:56:33.420]  the cameras were in there and he was basically saying look you know I know that we don't like tariffs
[01:56:33.420 --> 01:56:39.340]  I know that that's something we've been against but one thing we've always been for is America first
[01:56:39.340 --> 01:56:43.900]  I mean keeping American businesses here keeping American manufacturing here keeping the wealth
[01:56:43.900 --> 01:56:50.700]  and the prosperity here and that I think is what's driving this policy and these tariffs so again
[01:56:50.700 --> 01:56:57.500]  we'll have to see what happens but I'm just more on the side of I trust Trump I'm not an expert I see
[01:56:57.500 --> 01:57:01.740]  experts on both sides of the aisle so I just want to wait and see what it bears out thank you for

[02:00:09.020 --> 02:00:13.420]  oh and shawyer you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:00:13.420 --> 02:00:20.540]  you know there's this
[02:00:23.340 --> 02:00:29.260]  i don't even know how to explain it most people wouldn't expect president trump and his campaign
[02:00:29.260 --> 02:00:38.940]  staff to be so advanced on social media where they do things that millennial social media
[02:00:38.940 --> 02:00:45.980]  expert users do where brad parskill tweets this out today hey facebook twitter google
[02:00:45.980 --> 02:00:52.780]  we are watching this is your my words final opportunity to make sure the playing field
[02:00:52.780 --> 02:01:00.700]  is level hashtag mega now guys if you would go to president trump's twitter and pull up i think
[02:01:00.700 --> 02:01:06.780]  it was like his third or fourth tweet ago where he says we are going to do something about stolen
[02:01:06.780 --> 02:01:12.460]  intellectual property but he doesn't really talk about who brad parskill doesn't really get into
[02:01:12.460 --> 02:01:17.500]  what he means by this is your opportunity to make sure the playing field is is level we're
[02:01:17.500 --> 02:01:22.060]  kind of just left to assume what that means let me explain to you what this is this is what
[02:01:22.780 --> 02:01:29.660]  millennials and twitter users call a sub tweet you notice sub tweet is leon yes i do well a
[02:01:29.660 --> 02:01:35.980]  sub tweet yeah there it is a sub tweet is when you put a tweet out there but there's actually a
[02:01:35.980 --> 02:01:42.620]  bit of nuance to it there's a message there's a hidden message underlining the actual tweet
[02:01:42.620 --> 02:01:47.500]  that's why it's called a sub tweet and president trump pull up that last tweet about intellectual
[02:01:47.500 --> 02:01:55.500]  property that tweet is 100 a sub tweet telling china to quit stealing our intellectual property
[02:01:55.500 --> 02:01:59.740]  that has been an ongoing story in this country for a while chinese hackers infiltrating us
[02:01:59.740 --> 02:02:04.300]  businesses stealing their intellectual property and then brad parskill hey facebook twitter google
[02:02:04.300 --> 02:02:07.580]  we are watching this is your opportunity to make sure the playing field is level i think
[02:02:07.580 --> 02:02:12.380]  there's a sub tweet there some of the callers think they have an idea of what that means but
[02:02:12.380 --> 02:02:15.980]  i mean leon what do you take out of this before we go to calls in the next segment what do you
[02:02:15.980 --> 02:02:20.940]  think about trump's new campaign manager the trump administration basically warning facebook
[02:02:20.940 --> 02:02:26.140]  twitter and google like hey we know what you're doing you better stop right this is i mean this is
[02:02:26.140 --> 02:02:31.100]  very important we see them really cracking down obviously leading up into the 2018 elections
[02:02:31.100 --> 02:02:36.140]  and then beyond and if they're allowed to get away with this and decide who has a voice in the
[02:02:36.140 --> 02:02:42.060]  public square i mean this is going to be probably one of the biggest free speech issues of our time
[02:02:42.060 --> 02:02:47.900]  this is huge and we have to decide now who's going to be in charge of the information that
[02:02:47.900 --> 02:02:52.620]  we are allowed to have access to and facebook twitter and google have gotten so big they're
[02:02:52.620 --> 02:02:56.220]  they're essentially bigger than the government i mean they're essentially bigger than the government
[02:02:56.220 --> 02:03:02.300]  a lot of them don't even pay taxes the government needs google's ai right to for the department
[02:03:02.300 --> 02:03:08.540]  of defense to help them with their drones so i mean they're they're huge same with you know amazon
[02:03:08.540 --> 02:03:14.220]  and how you know certain alphabet biographies use amazon cloud and everything right give out and
[02:03:14.220 --> 02:03:19.100]  then amazon doesn't pay taxes so there's a huge conflict of interest there and it really makes
[02:03:19.100 --> 02:03:24.460]  you wonder how do you how do you break that conflict of interest and and hold twitter facebook
[02:03:24.460 --> 02:03:30.220]  and google accountable right and i like this article out of bright bart i believe john nolte
[02:03:30.220 --> 02:03:35.660]  is the author and i like his writing style in general and you know he he's he admits he's not
[02:03:35.660 --> 02:03:40.940]  a fan of alex jones but you know he he knows he employs some good people but that doesn't mean
[02:03:40.940 --> 02:03:45.580]  that he wants to live in a country where an alex jones is not allowed to be a part of the public
[02:03:45.580 --> 02:03:50.300]  square he doesn't want to live in a country where certain people decide what's a conspiracy theory
[02:03:50.300 --> 02:03:56.540]  and what's the truth and i agree with that i mean because as we've seen a lot of these theories
[02:03:56.540 --> 02:04:03.660]  turn out to be facts and it's only after being pushed for decades that people do find the truth
[02:04:03.660 --> 02:04:08.860]  but we don't want to live in a world where people are not allowed to put theories out there and to
[02:04:08.860 --> 02:04:14.140]  question the official narrative yeah if you go back and you listen to an alex jones show from
[02:04:14.140 --> 02:04:18.380]  ten years ago you'd think you were listening to something predicting the future right but that's
[02:04:18.380 --> 02:04:23.020]  just because he was reporting on real news he wasn't controlled like mainstream media was
[02:04:24.060 --> 02:04:30.380]  and and now that we have this pushback with the internet being open new media you know coming and
[02:04:30.380 --> 02:04:35.100]  getting more audience this is like their pushback to try to stop that because they can't control the
[02:04:35.100 --> 02:04:39.580]  narrative anymore and it freaks them out but you would think i mean with with the craziness that
[02:04:39.580 --> 02:04:43.900]  goes on on the alex jones show i mean myself included you would think they want that for content
[02:04:43.900 --> 02:04:49.260]  just like i want don lemons idiotic comments and rachel madcow's idiotic comments so that i can
[02:04:49.260 --> 02:04:53.420]  respond i don't like the fact they're liars and deceivers but we don't call for them to be shut
[02:04:53.420 --> 02:05:01.180]  down that's the difference right i'm so excited the new product at info warslife.com in a glass

[02:06:34.940 --> 02:06:40.460]  here again the topics today were what do you think of brad par skills tweets uh tweet warning
[02:06:40.460 --> 02:06:45.980]  facebook twitter and google to stop censoring and then do you work in the steel industry do you live
[02:06:45.980 --> 02:06:50.860]  in steel country what differences are you seeing since the tariffs have been talked about and i
[02:06:50.860 --> 02:06:55.260]  believe they got enacted either today or yesterday and we've got some callers calling in right now
[02:06:55.260 --> 02:06:59.980]  that work in the steel industry scott calling in from indiana works at us steel we heard from the
[02:06:59.980 --> 02:07:06.300]  ceo of us deal crediting trump with delivering scott what do you think about president trump
[02:07:06.300 --> 02:07:12.780]  and the tariffs bringing steel manufacturing back to america good afternoon how you doing i
[02:07:12.780 --> 02:07:17.660]  appreciate what you guys are doing um you know you guys are standing up for everybody and you're
[02:07:17.660 --> 02:07:24.620]  the tip of the spear thank you guys the whole crew for what you do um yeah it i think it's
[02:07:24.620 --> 02:07:30.220]  going to be a good thing i think it's been a long overdue um you know things have been
[02:07:30.220 --> 02:07:36.780]  shutting down uh our sister plant in granite city at all illinois i've known people from that plant
[02:07:36.780 --> 02:07:42.620]  and uh it it it basically shuts down that whole community when that plant went down i don't
[02:07:42.620 --> 02:07:46.540]  think i can tell you and i can tell you um i'm from st louis granite city is just on the other
[02:07:46.540 --> 02:07:50.780]  side of the river uh member of the crew here lived on the ill side and we were actually talking
[02:07:50.780 --> 02:07:55.340]  about that one of the breaks there used to be all types of manufacturing lining the mississippi
[02:07:55.340 --> 02:08:01.820]  river in st louis in granite city in bellville and it just got all shut down it just disappeared
[02:08:01.820 --> 02:08:06.140]  and you go down the mississippi river whether you're on the ill side of the most side and there's
[02:08:06.140 --> 02:08:12.700]  just empty manufacturing plants everywhere it's terrible people don't understand the association
[02:08:12.700 --> 02:08:19.100]  of big steel in any community where a mill is located you've got people that sell fasteners you
[02:08:19.100 --> 02:08:25.580]  get people that sell office supplies you've got restaurants diners that that line that area um
[02:08:26.540 --> 02:08:32.460]  supermarkets it's all tied together the steel mill supports so many other businesses in any
[02:08:32.460 --> 02:08:39.580]  community they're in and when that steel mill is gone it has a huge impact on any area economy
[02:08:40.220 --> 02:08:46.140]  any small businesses it's terrible it's very terrible to see that happen well and just think
[02:08:46.140 --> 02:08:51.020]  about it guys is that the one from granite city that you just pulled up there all right well
[02:08:51.020 --> 02:08:57.260]  there's just an example of an empty steel mill but but just to echo what scott is saying you don't
[02:08:57.260 --> 02:09:03.580]  have to listen to scott to know that he's telling the truth all you have to do is go to the local
[02:09:03.580 --> 02:09:10.620]  the biggest city by you go to the the inner city by you whether it's st louis or chicago or baltimore
[02:09:10.620 --> 02:09:16.300]  you have massive manufacturing plants shut down empty warehouses empty buildings and then that's
[02:09:16.300 --> 02:09:21.100]  what's guys talking about that brings the poverty that brings the the lack of job opportunity that
[02:09:21.100 --> 02:09:25.740]  brings the lack of growth and then the homelessness and then the rest of the degradation that comes
[02:09:25.740 --> 02:09:31.820]  with it i mean it's so weirdly and that this is some sort of foreign concept that people see right
[02:09:31.820 --> 02:09:36.060]  in front of their face right they go downtown they see the empty warehouses they see the manufacturing
[02:09:36.060 --> 02:09:39.740]  shutdown but it like it doesn't click why all of a sudden is there poverty here why is this being
[02:09:39.740 --> 02:09:44.940]  shut down right why why our entire cities that were once booming they've just disappeared like
[02:09:44.940 --> 02:09:49.820]  detroit has to move away and then and then they suggest oh well let's build up detroit by bringing
[02:09:49.820 --> 02:09:56.220]  in refugees and re-creating a new city with you know foreigners but i mean it's just we're seeing
[02:09:56.220 --> 02:10:02.060]  that all over the country and now scott you say you work at us deal we heard from the ceo earlier
[02:10:02.060 --> 02:10:07.820]  i mean are you guys as a company i mean is this like just huge for you just expansion more job
[02:10:07.820 --> 02:10:13.420]  more work i mean is this just like a celebration time for for your industry right now well what
[02:10:13.420 --> 02:10:20.460]  what happened us up here in the northwest indiana we're kind of the flagship of the us deal corporation
[02:10:20.460 --> 02:10:25.020]  so when they started shutting down you know it's it's like you start shutting down things to keep
[02:10:25.020 --> 02:10:31.660]  the main body alive we've been running pretty strong up here in northwest indiana we really
[02:10:31.660 --> 02:10:39.500]  haven't missed a beat but again they were shutting down granite city they shut down our tubular plants
[02:10:39.500 --> 02:10:45.580]  in lorraine ohio uh at fairfield alabama they shut down a blast furnace in fairfield alabama
[02:10:45.580 --> 02:10:52.140]  that one doesn't get the press fairfield is all but gone um you had texas the lone star tubular
[02:10:52.940 --> 02:10:57.740]  us deal owns that and since the gas prices are doing what they're doing the tubular businesses
[02:10:57.740 --> 02:11:03.420]  in the toilet so there's been a lot of other exterior facilities that have been shut down
[02:11:03.420 --> 02:11:08.140]  but we've been running pretty strong here in northwest indiana but they're going to expect
[02:11:08.140 --> 02:11:15.260]  us to run even harder now and that's the insight that's such good insight scott because as you
[02:11:15.260 --> 02:11:23.660]  mentioned earlier those manufacturing plants and and those companies created cities i mean that's
[02:11:23.660 --> 02:11:28.780]  how american cities would would come about you create a business you have a manufacturing plant
[02:11:28.780 --> 02:11:33.180]  and then you hire people and then they hire people and then it gets bigger and then you manufacture
[02:11:33.180 --> 02:11:39.180]  more i mean that was that that used to be what built america that was industrialism right right
[02:11:39.820 --> 02:11:44.380]  no when we're here in northwest indiana one time our plant just this plant
[02:11:45.100 --> 02:11:53.420]  employed 27 000 people we are down to 4 000 people now do you expect that number to go back up now
[02:11:54.460 --> 02:12:01.500]  yes they they're in the process of hiring as we speak wow so so more jobs more job opportunities
[02:12:01.500 --> 02:12:06.780]  more work and it looks like this is trump delivering on bringing manufacturing specifically
[02:12:06.780 --> 02:12:10.300]  in the steel industry back to america thank you so much for the call scott he mentioned
[02:12:10.300 --> 02:12:16.380]  ohio we know we now go out to ohio where matt calls in he also works at a steel mill go ahead matt
[02:12:18.220 --> 02:12:23.980]  hi uh hi oh and uh also want to hit a quick plug i take dna force i thank you guys for that it's a
[02:12:23.980 --> 02:12:31.100]  great product works great uh highly and uh i actually did work in steel industry and steel
[02:12:31.100 --> 02:12:37.260]  country my dad spent 16 years at or met aluminum plant i was at or met with him and then went to
[02:12:37.260 --> 02:12:43.100]  wheeling pittsburgh steel and a job that i thought i'd have for life the tariffs actually shut them
[02:12:43.100 --> 02:12:49.980]  down and uh now since trumps been in that mill has opened back up they might do more hiring they're
[02:12:49.980 --> 02:12:54.780]  hoping to open the whole thing up now that the tariffs actually started to go away they're
[02:12:54.780 --> 02:12:59.100]  actually hoping to expand and a couple other industries up the ohio river are starting to open
[02:12:59.100 --> 02:13:05.260]  up so it sounds to me that the heads of these industries were shutting down and kind of rationing
[02:13:05.260 --> 02:13:09.340]  back because they didn't have that confidence in the future market they didn't think that that
[02:13:09.340 --> 02:13:13.660]  that business opportunity would be there in the future now they have that confidence they see signs
[02:13:13.660 --> 02:13:19.900]  of it returning so they're reopening and they're actually getting the jobs back yes the same way
[02:13:19.900 --> 02:13:24.700]  with so after the steel industry i went underground in the coal mine and hope to retire there but
[02:13:24.700 --> 02:13:30.540]  obama of course shut that down with the no with the war on coal policy but now that that's out the
[02:13:30.540 --> 02:13:35.980]  coal industry now around here because we border west virginia we're right across the river the
[02:13:35.980 --> 02:13:41.340]  coal country and steel country in the same place and they're both now just getting just booming
[02:13:41.340 --> 02:13:45.900]  because it shut the economy down it shut the towns down the i lived in and grew up in it's a
[02:13:45.900 --> 02:13:50.780]  completely different place see and that's what is so frustrating about this land because the
[02:13:50.780 --> 02:13:55.340]  democrats and liberals like obama say well we have to shut this down we have to kill coal to stop
[02:13:55.340 --> 02:13:59.340]  steel manufacturing because it kills the environment they're not actually stopping it from being
[02:13:59.340 --> 02:14:03.260]  produced it just goes overseas and all that wealth and prosperity goes somewhere else and then it
[02:14:03.260 --> 02:14:06.940]  destroys the american cities i mean doesn't that show how phony they are they don't actually stop
[02:14:06.940 --> 02:14:11.340]  it from happening they just stop america from benefiting right and no plan as far as how to
[02:14:11.340 --> 02:14:16.380]  replace those jobs or what they were going to do i mean just listening to these callers i i can't help
[02:14:16.380 --> 02:14:24.140]  but feel just such tremendous relief about can you imagine how close this country was to collapsing
[02:14:24.140 --> 02:14:28.380]  and people were just ready to kind of throw in the towel we've got our we we bought our home in
[02:14:28.380 --> 02:14:33.260]  new zealand for the collapse will be fine the rest of you are going to have to fend for yourselves
[02:14:33.260 --> 02:14:38.460]  in your collapsing country i mean i know when i went to flint michigan that's what it looked like
[02:14:38.460 --> 02:14:44.060]  there just a ghost town and then you had your several just a few families were holding on there
[02:14:44.060 --> 02:14:47.660]  maybe they couldn't afford to move out or you know that's where their generations of families
[02:14:47.660 --> 02:14:52.300]  had lived there but a ghost town and then you see pictures of the old downtown and the people are
[02:14:52.300 --> 02:14:58.780]  like in fur coats and you know just a booming booming downtown and then it turns into blight
[02:14:58.780 --> 02:15:03.580]  where they have to destroy the homes and it was all independent too because they had their own
[02:15:03.580 --> 02:15:07.420]  manufacturing company they had their own commerce they had their own market there that they could
[02:15:07.420 --> 02:15:11.500]  always count on thriving and it just gets shut down with all these government regulations
[02:15:11.500 --> 02:15:18.140]  um matt you got 30 seconds left uh do you expect this trend of more steel jobs more
[02:15:18.140 --> 02:15:23.740]  steel manufacturing to continue here in america yes i do i think it's going to prosper great

[02:20:45.740 --> 02:20:53.100]  first ever hearing on climate change science now this is set to be an absolute circus you know
[02:20:53.100 --> 02:21:00.380]  that the left is going to have their protesters out there but you wonder will sanity prevail because
[02:21:00.380 --> 02:21:05.420]  there is no science on man-made climate change but this is going to be strange because you know
[02:21:05.420 --> 02:21:09.740]  they're going to try to twist it and spin it and manipulate it and then say it's man-made
[02:21:09.740 --> 02:21:14.620]  even though there's no science there's just theories and formulas and then they'll use real
[02:21:14.620 --> 02:21:19.180]  science that indicates climate change not man-made and then they'll say it's man-made
[02:21:19.180 --> 02:21:25.420]  so that's going to be an absolute circus um i'm excited to stay tuned to that fbi agent and a
[02:21:25.420 --> 02:21:31.420]  strange wife dead in apparent murder suicide um in crownsville i think that's just outside of
[02:21:31.420 --> 02:21:41.660]  anopolis maryland um donna fisher and fbi special agent david reynard um both dead and an apparent
[02:21:41.660 --> 02:21:47.820]  murder suicide um so an interesting story there secret service employee arrested on
[02:21:47.820 --> 02:21:53.900]  child porn charges this also in maryland 52 year old so all these guys are in their 50s
[02:21:53.900 --> 02:22:00.300]  52 year old jeffrey literal how about that literal faces charges of possession of child
[02:22:00.300 --> 02:22:04.780]  pornography distribution of child pornography possession of obscene material and distribution
[02:22:04.780 --> 02:22:12.220]  of obscene material a secret service employee boy that is uh something something you always
[02:22:12.220 --> 02:22:16.540]  gotta wonder there when that type of stuff happens yeah like who what secret service who is he working
[02:22:16.540 --> 02:22:23.260]  for and uh you know who who who was friends with him uh ho picks told house intelligence committee
[02:22:23.260 --> 02:22:30.540]  she was hacked yeah i mean this is kind of a duh type of a story but again it just tells you the
[02:22:30.540 --> 02:22:35.500]  deep state is up to things i mean even i mean russia's up to things too i mean i don't know who
[02:22:35.500 --> 02:22:39.660]  who fished john podesta was it russians i mean i don't know john podesta is an idiot
[02:22:39.660 --> 02:22:45.180]  he fell for it he fell for prince abu abu you know offering ten thousand dollars and then lian
[02:22:45.180 --> 02:22:48.540]  actually you want to talk about this why don't you read that story for us right well this was a
[02:22:48.540 --> 02:22:55.260]  conspiracy theory you know maybe even just a year ago that from alex jones um that talking about using
[02:22:55.260 --> 02:23:02.460]  pigs for transplantation to humans and this is a scientist developing pigs for transplants and they
[02:23:02.460 --> 02:23:09.900]  kind of give this whole process for how they're going to remove the uterus from a pregnant pig
[02:23:09.900 --> 02:23:16.140]  just before delivery and disinfect it take the newborn piglets out of the uterus raise with
[02:23:16.140 --> 02:23:20.540]  sterile artificial milk raise the piglets for three weeks conduct all sorts of tests
[02:23:20.540 --> 02:23:27.100]  um but then of course being able to transplant these pancreas live liver kidneys and any other
[02:23:27.100 --> 02:23:32.060]  organs into humans that might need them cell patients i don't know what your take on this
[02:23:32.060 --> 02:23:37.100]  is my take honestly i mean i don't know i'm kind of open minded about it if my life end up ends
[02:23:37.100 --> 02:23:42.220]  up getting saved by a pig liver i mean i guess i would support that uh but is that what we're
[02:23:42.220 --> 02:23:46.220]  really supposed to be doing with science i'm not sure but again the story to me is that
[02:23:46.220 --> 02:23:50.940]  they said that this was fake news they said that info wars were conspiracy theorists for reporting
[02:23:50.940 --> 02:23:56.300]  on this but it's like no it's really happening and it's not just pigs and you know just because
[02:23:56.300 --> 02:24:00.140]  they're telling you that this is going on now this has been probably going on for decades you know
[02:24:00.140 --> 02:24:05.980]  what i'm saying so we've actually got a caller who the screeners let slip through however he was
[02:24:05.980 --> 02:24:12.700]  lucky because it is a topic it is a shame shame shame shame it is a topic that we wanted to discuss
[02:24:12.700 --> 02:24:17.260]  so let's go out to dan in canada who wanted to talk about the human organs and pigs go ahead dan
[02:24:18.140 --> 02:24:22.380]  oh yeah definitely shame on me for that right well it's not shame on you it's shame on the
[02:24:22.380 --> 02:24:29.180]  screeners how you guys doing today doing good good good good yeah i've been doing a
[02:24:30.460 --> 02:24:36.620]  a bit of research into this subject matter i just find it weird like how do you these people go
[02:24:36.620 --> 02:24:41.340]  about doing that thing do they go to the farmers hey we need to do some tests on your pigs can we
[02:24:41.340 --> 02:24:46.780]  borrow one for you guys like how is that like they just go buy one from the farmers market and
[02:24:47.820 --> 02:24:51.420]  yeah i mean who knows what i mean come on man you know what kind of who knows what goes on at
[02:24:51.420 --> 02:24:58.700]  cia black size yeah like i i was born with only one kidney so it's like um i'm not too
[02:24:58.700 --> 02:25:02.620]  terrified to really feel safe having like either like a pig or even with like a cow or
[02:25:02.620 --> 02:25:06.940]  someone or animal like i just like we said it's a very like a controversial thing and
[02:25:06.940 --> 02:25:14.460]  and it's a human pig hybrid which you know the that's that's that's not real that's fake news
[02:25:14.460 --> 02:25:20.220]  i mean it's happening japanese scientists have have developed it but but you're saying you're
[02:25:20.220 --> 02:25:26.220]  saying as somebody that that may benefit from this science even it's even iffy for you oh yes
[02:25:26.220 --> 02:25:31.260]  for sure because um this goes back to like even i know you guys don't really cover this much topic
[02:25:31.260 --> 02:25:37.340]  but ufo stuff you can hear both like cow mutilation stuff like taking the organs out of that that's like
[02:25:37.340 --> 02:25:42.620]  that's some pretty crazy stuff that now that uh going from that theory to now humans are integrating
[02:25:42.620 --> 02:25:47.020]  animal organs with humans like how do we even know that stuff even compatible compatible
[02:25:47.020 --> 02:25:51.580]  with humans and vice versa well i assume that they've been testing this for a while and they're
[02:25:51.580 --> 02:25:58.140]  just now releasing it to the public um as far as ufo's obliterating cow organs i don't know liana
[02:25:58.140 --> 02:26:03.100]  do you know anything about that i i do know i've heard i assume you did yes of course but um you
[02:26:03.100 --> 02:26:08.540]  know it might help with organ harvesting and trafficking people for their organs specifically
[02:26:08.540 --> 02:26:15.260]  to you know remove their organs a lot of people fleeing uh africa for instance there's they've
[02:26:15.260 --> 02:26:20.700]  been accused of oh yeah you've had you've had organ hard well you know what i won't we don't
[02:26:20.700 --> 02:26:24.780]  need to go too deep into the rabbit hole but yeah organ harvesting is a big industry no
[02:26:24.780 --> 02:26:31.420]  doubt even on the black market anything else dan um just uh not i've been hearing uh back even in
[02:26:31.420 --> 02:26:36.140]  the 90s with uh the chinese and human cloning i just i thought that was a bit of an interesting
[02:26:36.140 --> 02:26:41.740]  something to remember hearing about that earlier in the 90s yeah now you've got who is it who is it
[02:26:41.740 --> 02:26:46.700]  that just cloned their dog barbara strisand was it barbara strisand that cloned their dog somebody
[02:26:46.700 --> 02:26:52.540]  cloned their dog yes two dogs now out of her cloned dog and you can make dogs that like glow
[02:26:52.540 --> 02:26:57.660]  in the dark too or something yeah who doesn't want that yeah all right dan hey thank you so much for
[02:26:57.660 --> 02:27:04.940]  the call um by the way we are about to run out of time here in this segment but we've got this story
[02:27:04.940 --> 02:27:10.700]  on info wars dot com hollywood openly celebrates the triumph of the beta male it you know it was
[02:27:10.700 --> 02:27:15.740]  actually funny leon i saw that this this hollywood reporter cover it went totally viral on social media
[02:27:15.740 --> 02:27:22.140]  yesterday it's got four beta males on the cover and the cover title is triumph of the beta male
[02:27:22.140 --> 02:27:26.060]  and then look at this they're all playing pocket pool with one another what do you think about that leon

[02:35:20.140 --> 02:35:24.860]  who wants to talk about the brad par scale tweet warning twitter google and facebook go ahead brad
[02:35:24.860 --> 02:35:32.620]  or scott hey man thanks for having me on um what we really need to do is take over the companies
[02:35:32.620 --> 02:35:38.140]  in order to make sure they have a plan to deal with that level for us uh in order to do that what
[02:35:38.140 --> 02:35:43.580]  we need to do is to start buying their stock and they may try to dump the values and they try to
[02:35:43.580 --> 02:35:47.740]  raise the value but really what you need to start doing is just calling up your friends calling up
[02:35:47.740 --> 02:35:53.180]  your neighbors and saying hey we're under attack this is the way to beat the censorship we need to
[02:35:53.180 --> 02:36:02.460]  get on the border director we need to start changing this stuff now i took the when i saw your
[02:36:02.460 --> 02:36:07.020]  subject on the list here i was wondering if you meant that brad par scale was kind of
[02:36:07.020 --> 02:36:11.820]  sub tweeting here saying hey look abandon your stock in facebook twitter and google because
[02:36:11.820 --> 02:36:18.220]  they're about to go down oh no i mean that's the thing they're wants to plunge their stock to try
[02:36:18.220 --> 02:36:24.620]  and get you to sell out but when that happens buy more so that you can be on that board so that you
[02:36:24.620 --> 02:36:32.380]  can stop censorship so that you can replace the entire border director and get new fresh people
[02:36:32.380 --> 02:36:38.860]  that are either more moderate or more conservative on there i mean we know zuckerberg told a huge
[02:36:38.860 --> 02:36:43.500]  rally i think it was last year two years ago or something like that the human t-shirt
[02:36:44.940 --> 02:36:49.420]  yeah we're um he invited all the conservative people over but he didn't really do anything
[02:36:49.420 --> 02:36:54.620]  with that other than know who to censor well he's low energy he's a prop he's a walking human
[02:36:54.620 --> 02:36:58.460]  t-shirt so i you know it's that's what you get from mark zuckerberg oh my whoa i didn't even know
[02:36:58.460 --> 02:37:03.340]  he ever wore a tie unbelievable hey thank you for the call scott uh interesting stuff there an
[02:37:03.340 --> 02:37:06.620]  interesting angle i haven't really heard about anybody uh thinking about it or approaching it
[02:37:06.620 --> 02:37:12.940]  like that let's go to mark who is from the steel industry out in atlanta go ahead mark
[02:37:14.620 --> 02:37:20.380]  yeah hey oh and hey listen um i just wanted to make the point that uh domestically produced
[02:37:20.380 --> 02:37:28.060]  steel is a strategic asset for any country and uh it was the steel industry here in america that
[02:37:28.060 --> 02:37:37.500]  actually won world war two and uh i think it's a possibility trump may be preparing this country for
[02:37:37.500 --> 02:37:43.580]  or maybe a war with china you know what this is this is actually an excellent caller right here now
[02:37:44.460 --> 02:37:51.020]  i'm actually recalling too not only did us steal manufacture during the war for the american army
[02:37:51.020 --> 02:37:57.340]  but also for the nazis uh i think for the italians and i think for like almost everyone involved in
[02:37:57.340 --> 02:38:02.540]  the war us steel is using being used to manufacture their weapons so yeah that's an interesting point
[02:38:03.100 --> 02:38:09.100]  bringing the steel back to america to give more leverage to the united states if uh the the terrible
[02:38:09.100 --> 02:38:14.620]  situation of a war broke out right good point anything else mark so yeah please remember that
[02:38:14.620 --> 02:38:20.700]  japan one of the reason they were good japan was building aircraft out of wood because of their lack
[02:38:20.700 --> 02:38:27.420]  of raw you know net resources for to make steel and uh it was you know then the fact that japan was
[02:38:27.420 --> 02:38:32.780]  an island and had they had to already had to import all their raw materials for the still for their
[02:38:32.780 --> 02:38:38.700]  stereo steel industry but as we cut those materials off that was one of the things that helped us
[02:38:38.700 --> 02:38:45.900]  win world war two so my point is domestic steel production is an essential uh you know item if
[02:38:45.900 --> 02:38:51.180]  you're looking at a at a war with you know even a minor war you know it's a total asset think about
[02:38:51.180 --> 02:38:56.220]  if your enemy wanted to cripple you and handicap you in the time of war what they would do they would
[02:38:56.220 --> 02:39:02.460]  shut down the steel manufacturer right you know you can't well you can't build tanks that i always
[02:39:02.460 --> 02:39:07.020]  you know it has to be steel you know so uh well not good tanks anyway what was the name of the
[02:39:07.020 --> 02:39:13.580]  company was it ig farbin they were so i can't remember there was some steel manufacturing
[02:39:13.580 --> 02:39:17.260]  company in the united states i mean they were literally making they were manufacturing everything
[02:39:17.260 --> 02:39:23.180]  for the whole war i mean they'd make the tanks for both sides so i mean yeah great caller mark
[02:39:23.180 --> 02:39:28.860]  in atlanta great point uh how the steel industry is so important during times of war and given the
[02:39:28.860 --> 02:39:34.140]  escalating tensions geopolitically perhaps that's a strategic move by president trump now let's go to
[02:39:34.140 --> 02:39:38.860]  rob in indiana he's been working in the steel industry for almost three decades go ahead rob
[02:39:38.860 --> 02:39:45.660]  oh and how are you great pleasure to talk to you as a matter of fact i just want to tell you how much
[02:39:45.660 --> 02:39:53.100]  of a patriot you are and how much i appreciate listening to your comments that it's it's refreshing
[02:39:53.100 --> 02:40:00.060]  so thank you well common sense isn't so common well we're we're lacking that look the what i'm
[02:40:00.060 --> 02:40:07.100]  going to get at here is uh the media is not talking about the fact that we've been assaulted with
[02:40:07.100 --> 02:40:15.100]  what's called dump steel for the last 30 to 40 years and what that means is that producers other
[02:40:15.100 --> 02:40:22.620]  countries they're actually making the steel they're selling it below the cost of what it cost them to
[02:40:23.260 --> 02:40:30.700]  make the product and then they are being reimbursed by their country for the difference so they don't
[02:40:30.700 --> 02:40:39.260]  lose anything but what they do is they undercut our market which messes us up so all so that's
[02:40:39.260 --> 02:40:44.060]  kind of like china so that's kind of like china manipulating their currency that's exactly what
[02:40:44.060 --> 02:40:48.780]  they're doing it's called illegal dump steel they've been doing it we've been fighting it forever
[02:40:48.780 --> 02:40:55.340]  and it's finally amazing to see a republican president stand up and do something and actually
[02:40:55.340 --> 02:41:00.860]  did what does what he says he's going to do we everyone else has all been talk talk talk and
[02:41:01.420 --> 02:41:06.700]  all the unions and all these steel industries we all support them but they never follow through
[02:41:06.700 --> 02:41:12.620]  and it's so refreshing to have trump actually do what he's going to say say what he's going to do
[02:41:12.620 --> 02:41:18.860]  and just do it well robbie it's says here you've been working in the steel industry for almost
[02:41:18.860 --> 02:41:24.380]  three decades i mean these are some of the toughest workers in the union here i mean what what have you
[02:41:24.380 --> 02:41:31.020]  seen in the steel industry just since trump's been elected well i tell you what um what i've seen is
[02:41:31.020 --> 02:41:36.620]  just a huge push we're actually almost running at capacity right now yeah that's keep that's
[02:41:36.620 --> 02:41:41.820]  what i keep hearing yeah we are we're two years ago we're two years ago it was like you could
[02:41:41.820 --> 02:41:47.580]  hardly even get work well that's true and we're hiring now we've we haven't we've had a drive
[02:41:47.580 --> 02:41:53.340]  spell with hiring the last two to three four years now we're hiring we can't get enough people so
[02:41:53.340 --> 02:41:59.180]  it's it's uh it's it's nice it's good for our economy and these are good paying jobs but what
[02:41:59.180 --> 02:42:03.580]  people fail to realize is everything out here tries to kill us and when you work in the steel
[02:42:03.580 --> 02:42:10.140]  industry everything is trying to get you even the air you breathe is toxic so i mean it's not a fun
[02:42:10.140 --> 02:42:15.740]  place to work by any means but it's what we do and it's the background of the country i mean that
[02:42:15.740 --> 02:42:21.740]  exactly that's the american grit that's the american grit that that created this nation and you know
[02:42:21.740 --> 02:42:27.420]  what when you work in the steel industry and you have to deal with the heat and the smelting
[02:42:27.420 --> 02:42:33.340]  and everything that you deal with and the toxic air and you go home and you've got some beta cuck
[02:42:33.340 --> 02:42:40.300]  son who wants to be you know some soy boy you're not going to stand for that they've killed american
[02:42:40.300 --> 02:42:44.940]  grit they killed american grit in the manufacturing industry they killed american grit in the home
[02:42:44.940 --> 02:42:49.340]  they killed american grit in the school it's time for american grit to come back and that's what
[02:42:49.340 --> 02:42:53.020]  president trump is invoking alex jones on the other side don't go anywhere
[02:42:56.540 --> 02:43:00.620]  the reason info wars life has five star ratings on major third party sites is because i want

[02:46:24.780 --> 02:46:31.100]  cheap energy drinks energy shots they've been ton of money there sourced from powerful organic herbs
[02:46:31.100 --> 02:46:38.300]  harvested around the planet and then concentrated or maximum potency they want to stun and dumb down

[02:46:55.340 --> 02:47:11.260]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:47:11.260 --> 02:47:21.260]  you
[02:47:24.380 --> 02:47:33.260]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[02:47:33.260 --> 02:47:41.260]  you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[02:47:46.700 --> 02:47:52.060]  on the front cover of the current issue of hollywood reporter it has members of the male cast of
[02:47:52.060 --> 02:47:59.580]  silicon valley putting their hands in each other's pockets in a very sexual way with the headline
[02:47:59.580 --> 02:48:07.580]  the triumph of the beta male the victory of the beta male there to be celebrated for all to see
[02:48:07.580 --> 02:48:15.580]  but what's really being said here they're saying if you act like a domesticated twisted version
[02:48:15.580 --> 02:48:21.580]  of an effeminate creature that somehow you're going to end up in dominant positions in the corporate
[02:48:21.580 --> 02:48:29.580]  world because you see jeff bezos and all the rest of the heads of the tech titan companies
[02:48:29.580 --> 02:48:37.580]  are cold-blooded globalists who are committed to consolidating wealth and viciously dehumanizing
[02:48:37.580 --> 02:48:43.580]  the population if you look at apple you look at facebook twitter you look at amazon all these
[02:48:43.580 --> 02:48:53.580]  companies pay either zero or next to zero taxes in the united states they've all basically moved
[02:48:53.580 --> 02:49:01.580]  to china apple's actually merged with the chinese government but they project this issue of the
[02:49:01.580 --> 02:49:06.580]  beta male out into the population like it's cool and trendy so people accept the fact that they've
[02:49:06.580 --> 02:49:12.580]  been emasculated growing up indoors watching television playing video games eating massive
[02:49:12.580 --> 02:49:19.580]  amounts of estrogen mimicers not just the soy milk but the bpa and the rest of it in the plastics
[02:49:19.580 --> 02:49:25.580]  and so they're basically making it cool this synthetic transformation that has been engineered
[02:49:25.580 --> 02:49:30.580]  over the males and the chemicals are so powerful that in most areas of the united states 50 to
[02:49:30.580 --> 02:49:38.580]  80 percent of the amphibian life is sterile and in many cases according to scientific studies
[02:49:38.580 --> 02:49:46.580]  the male frogs prefer other male frogs and so the female frogs never get their eggs fertilized
[02:49:46.580 --> 02:49:51.580]  and so the amphibian populations are nose diving just like fish populations and other
[02:49:51.580 --> 02:49:58.580]  but then again the soy boy is taught to just giggle to laugh to make it all a big joke and
[02:49:58.580 --> 02:50:05.580]  it's no big deal their own demise they're taught to love the transformation that's taken place
[02:50:05.580 --> 02:50:09.580]  and now with the genetic engineering and the genetic drift happening and the mutations
[02:50:09.580 --> 02:50:14.580]  exploding on our species so if you looked at any other species and said they're going sterile
[02:50:14.580 --> 02:50:22.580]  their IQs are dropping their males are shriveled and weak you would say look at the decline
[02:50:22.580 --> 02:50:28.580]  of the polar bear look at the decline of this type of praying manus or look at the decline
[02:50:28.580 --> 02:50:37.580]  of the red tail hawk or look at the cause of pesticides on the condor falcons eggs almost
[02:50:37.580 --> 02:50:43.580]  making them go extinct but instead it's the triumph of the beta male now I've been friends
[02:50:43.580 --> 02:50:48.580]  with my judge for years creator of silicon valley he was some butt head king of the hill
[02:50:48.580 --> 02:50:54.580]  and he's a patriot he's libertarian and I've seen the show I don't think overall its message
[02:50:54.580 --> 02:50:59.580]  bad in all cases but it is a modern message the point is the media takes what he's saying
[02:50:59.580 --> 02:51:04.580]  about silicon valley and then projects the idea that it's the triumph of the beta male
[02:51:04.580 --> 02:51:11.580]  silicon valley is the triumph of alpha predators posing as other beta males and being part
[02:51:11.580 --> 02:51:16.580]  of the whole globalist engineering program that the former white house science sergeant
[02:51:16.580 --> 02:51:22.580]  p. Holdren wrote about the year I was born in 1974 the 1100 page book is free online
[02:51:22.580 --> 02:51:27.580]  and it buys you all to go scan over it how they called for the emasculation of males
[02:51:27.580 --> 02:51:34.580]  with estrogen mimicers in the food and water so look into all this now for women it's causing
[02:51:34.580 --> 02:51:40.580]  them to be hyper feminine that is accelerating the aging of their ovaries of their uterus
[02:51:40.580 --> 02:51:48.580]  and of their breast tissue all sexual tissue in the female body is associated with reproduction
[02:51:48.580 --> 02:51:52.580]  and it's the age the very accelerated rate when you have higher levels of glyphosate in
[02:51:52.580 --> 02:51:57.580]  the water and other estrogen mimicers it actually accelerates even more and gives you cancer
[02:51:57.580 --> 02:52:04.580]  all of this is admitted incontrovertible fact but again they call it a triumph so it's a beautiful
[02:52:04.580 --> 02:52:09.580]  thing and they have why the future doesn't need us and all these publications about the
[02:52:09.580 --> 02:52:15.580]  earth after humans and we're a scourge they're teaching us to hate ourselves the globalists
[02:52:15.580 --> 02:52:21.580]  now for life force to turn off our instincts so there's that report on m4wars.com it's critical
[02:52:21.580 --> 02:52:27.580]  for people to understand then the soy boys get together and mimic their bosses above
[02:52:27.580 --> 02:52:33.580]  them the robber baron technocrats posing as liberal trendies who are camouflage uniforms
[02:52:33.580 --> 02:52:40.580]  of Patagonia vest and you know little skinny jeans and all the rest of it it is a camouflage
[02:52:40.580 --> 02:52:46.580]  cover so that other alpha males that are still left despite the chemical warfare and the social
[02:52:46.580 --> 02:52:53.580]  warfare and the biological warfare don't notice that they're being taken control of and being
[02:52:53.580 --> 02:52:58.580]  enslaved and then the globalists are very good at then organizing the betas into what
[02:52:58.580 --> 02:53:02.580]  they call beta armies and remember I've been telling you about this for years and now you're
[02:53:02.580 --> 02:53:07.580]  seeing it being mainstream news that the nerd armies the beta armies well the nerd armies
[02:53:07.580 --> 02:53:12.580]  are being enslaved themselves but if they believe they're part of the ruling class and
[02:53:12.580 --> 02:53:17.580]  are in on the big joke and in on the censorship at Google Facebook Twitter Apple you name
[02:53:17.580 --> 02:53:24.580]  it they'll go along long enough until the AI and the algorithms and the Chinese communists
[02:53:24.580 --> 02:53:28.580]  who are now taking over Apple are able to replace them and that's exactly what's happening
[02:53:28.580 --> 02:53:33.580]  they're just like IBM engineers I knew 20 years ago several of them were my friends and they
[02:53:33.580 --> 02:53:39.580]  thought oh Alex they'll never get rid of us sure we're replying we're training our replacements
[02:53:39.580 --> 02:53:44.580]  and then years later when they got let go first their pay got cut then they got let go they
[02:53:44.580 --> 02:53:48.580]  understood then that they were destroying their own economy when you demand a better
[02:53:48.580 --> 02:53:54.580]  economy and better pay and more complex systems it's upwardly mobile but when you bring in
[02:53:54.580 --> 02:53:58.580]  centralized systems command and control systems it limits choices and vertically integrates
[02:53:58.580 --> 02:54:03.580]  wealth and there's many examples of this in history but just look at capitalism versus
[02:54:03.580 --> 02:54:07.580]  communism and other command and control systems like fascism and socialism they do not work
[02:54:07.580 --> 02:54:12.580]  at all because they're not designed to work for the average person there is designed to
[02:54:12.580 --> 02:54:17.580]  work for predatory elite then if you see another story on info wars dot com right now it's
[02:54:17.580 --> 02:54:24.580]  how in major studies in a new big study this guy television did in the UK people find women
[02:54:24.580 --> 02:54:29.580]  that say they're feminists incredibly unattractive and don't have anything to do with them well
[02:54:29.580 --> 02:54:36.580]  the plan is to get women to be unattractive and not be into a normal mammalian pattern
[02:54:36.580 --> 02:54:40.580]  and to have men so arrested in their development that they only want to hang around with other
[02:54:40.580 --> 02:54:45.580]  men like their 12 year old boys it's not a gay thing it's a aggressive development thing
[02:54:45.580 --> 02:54:50.580]  so the two sexes never get together and then if the sexes do want to get together there's
[02:54:50.580 --> 02:54:55.580]  so much me too movement demonizing the whole system between men and women coming together
[02:54:55.580 --> 02:55:00.580]  that it also stifles that the study showed as well and again you pull back it's the triumph
[02:55:00.580 --> 02:55:05.580]  of the end of humanity the triumph of a death culture the triumph of a culture committing
[02:55:05.580 --> 02:55:11.580]  suicide a triumph of the fall of humanity as we know it and the upwardly mobile renaissance
[02:55:11.580 --> 02:55:16.580]  systems that can take us to the stars and it's being done because of breakaway civilization
[02:55:16.580 --> 02:55:21.580]  as a side of the general public doesn't deserve to be part of the future or the life extension
[02:55:21.580 --> 02:55:25.580]  or any of the mysteries of the universe that we fellow humans have discovered and developed
[02:55:25.580 --> 02:55:31.580]  they intend to cut the resources off use governmental and corporate systems to extract the wealth
[02:55:31.580 --> 02:55:37.580]  and ideas put it through a cultural wall of the breakaway civilization while they build
[02:55:37.580 --> 02:55:44.580]  their structure and while we ourselves are basically then just recycled that's the plan
[02:55:44.580 --> 02:55:48.580]  this isn't a video game it's not a science fiction book it's the real world but a lot
[02:55:48.580 --> 02:55:52.580]  of people have decided to be delusional through their cognitive dissonance and decide they're
[02:55:52.580 --> 02:55:56.580]  part of the structure even though that structure is destroying them and to imagine that they're
[02:55:56.580 --> 02:56:02.580]  actually part of the power structure and are alphas so this whole beta thing is a alpha
[02:56:02.580 --> 02:56:11.580]  directed psycho alpha directed system organizing betas into quasi alpha groups but only as part
[02:56:11.580 --> 02:56:20.580]  time seasonal mercenaries in their own destruction alright that is the prime computation analysis
[02:56:20.580 --> 02:56:26.580]  info wars dot com news wars dot com prison planet dot com police research everything I've said
[02:56:26.580 --> 02:56:30.580]  you'll find out it's all in the public venue the globalist believe you're complete idiots
[02:56:30.580 --> 02:56:35.580]  I believe in you I have to believe in you because I know it's a feedback loop if I start believing
[02:56:35.580 --> 02:56:38.580]  you don't matter if I start believing you're scum then why should I care about my own children
[02:56:38.580 --> 02:56:41.580]  in the future for them I do believe in my children I believe in you and I believe in your
[02:56:41.580 --> 02:56:45.580]  children and I believe you should come together understand the attack on humanity and men and
[02:56:45.580 --> 02:56:49.580]  women should come together and realize our species has come so far together and reclaim
[02:56:49.580 --> 02:56:53.580]  our survival instinct and break free from the conditioning and move the next level and

[03:02:04.580 --> 03:02:12.580]  funding this is nothing like that okay let's get to these major stories first
[03:02:12.580 --> 03:02:18.580]  of all here's something breaking from Australia which is very important and I
[03:02:18.580 --> 03:02:22.580]  want to give credit to an independent media operation out there because we
[03:02:22.580 --> 03:02:30.580]  all are now depending on independent media supporting it the crass vials craz
[03:02:30.580 --> 03:02:40.580]  the crass vials in Australia reports on a defeat in Australia of a bill that
[03:02:40.580 --> 03:02:47.580]  would crush alternative complimentary traditional medicine such as Chinese
[03:02:47.580 --> 03:02:55.580]  medicine there was a major a coup attempt really in Australia so that all of
[03:02:55.580 --> 03:03:00.580]  these alternative traditional products would be marked with some kind of a
[03:03:00.580 --> 03:03:07.580]  government notice claiming this is all pseudoscience beware I mean you know if
[03:03:07.580 --> 03:03:12.580]  you want some reason not to buy a product right hey this is a great product
[03:03:12.580 --> 03:03:17.580]  but it's super pseudoscience so beware and don't get it that's kind of what the
[03:03:17.580 --> 03:03:23.580]  government was trying to do well this went down in flames a crushing defeat
[03:03:23.580 --> 03:03:31.580]  because as it turns out the people of Australia strongly support alternative
[03:03:31.580 --> 03:03:37.580]  complimentary traditional medicine whatever you want to call it natural
[03:03:37.580 --> 03:03:47.580]  health or even just health so this has gone down to an astounding defeat for
[03:03:47.580 --> 03:03:56.580]  the forces of evil in Australia which is a major victory so I put up an article
[03:03:56.580 --> 03:04:03.580]  about this at no more fake news and I included a part two which is a major
[03:04:03.580 --> 03:04:11.580]  revelation basically what I'm saying is do you think modern medicine is as is
[03:04:11.580 --> 03:04:17.580]  described by mainstream press do you really think that's what it is unending
[03:04:17.580 --> 03:04:24.580]  progress and so forth the dark side is concealed the conspiracy yes is
[03:04:24.580 --> 03:04:33.580]  concealed and the reason basically is as I've ordered before the local is and we
[03:04:33.580 --> 03:04:37.580]  will have more details after we go to
[03:04:40.580 --> 03:04:45.580]  infowars life is launching its newest product we're really really proud of

[03:05:56.580 --> 03:06:05.580]  the Alex Jones show and now your host John Rappaport
[03:06:05.580 --> 03:06:09.580]  okay back after the break John Rappaport here sitting in for Alex in the fourth
[03:06:09.580 --> 03:06:15.580]  hour at Info Wars so I was just talking about this major victory in Australia
[03:06:15.580 --> 03:06:24.580]  the globalist forces of evil over there we're trying to brand all alternative
[03:06:24.580 --> 03:06:34.580]  natural health remedies as pseudoscience warning beware etc etc so when we went to
[03:06:34.580 --> 03:06:38.580]  the break I said all this is about globalism it's about globalism's medical
[03:06:38.580 --> 03:06:43.580]  cartel which is attacking the globalist population as I've talked about here many
[03:06:43.580 --> 03:06:52.580]  times why because if you're going to control a planet you've got to weaken
[03:06:52.580 --> 03:06:59.580]  and disable the population and what better way to do that than through a
[03:06:59.580 --> 03:07:09.580]  complicated system of medical treatment that advertises itself as the essence of
[03:07:09.580 --> 03:07:17.580]  what humanity is all about that's the front story behind that is the pain the
[03:07:17.580 --> 03:07:24.580]  suffering the toxicity and the disabling medical treatments that soften up the
[03:07:24.580 --> 03:07:30.580]  global population for takeover so that we end up with basically one company one
[03:07:30.580 --> 03:07:36.580]  country or you could call it a company called planet Earth that is under a
[03:07:36.580 --> 03:07:43.580]  strict global management system no borders no nations that's the long range
[03:07:43.580 --> 03:07:51.580]  objective so in this article that I posted today talking about the victory in
[03:07:51.580 --> 03:07:57.580]  Australia I said well let's look at the dark side what is being concealed about
[03:07:57.580 --> 03:08:06.580]  modern medicine in fact let's go to the authorities let's go to people who are
[03:08:06.580 --> 03:08:15.580]  consummate insiders who have looked at red and scrutinized more medical studies
[03:08:15.580 --> 03:08:23.580]  over a long period of time than any doctor any medical bureaucrat any medical
[03:08:23.580 --> 03:08:34.580]  school instructor on the planet so the first insider is Dr. Marsha Angel
[03:08:34.580 --> 03:08:40.580]  formally the editor of one of the most prestigious medical journals in the
[03:08:40.580 --> 03:08:46.580]  world New England Journal of Medicine and let me read you a quote of hers from
[03:08:46.580 --> 03:08:53.580]  2009 New York review of books listen carefully screw in your thinking cap on
[03:08:53.580 --> 03:09:00.580]  this she says it is simply no longer possible to believe much of the clinical
[03:09:00.580 --> 03:09:06.580]  research that is published or to rely on the judgment of trusted physicians or
[03:09:06.580 --> 03:09:13.580]  authoritative medical guidelines I take no pleasure in this conclusion which I
[03:09:13.580 --> 03:09:19.580]  reached slowly and reluctantly over my two decades as editor of the New
[03:09:19.580 --> 03:09:30.580]  England Journal of Medicine cue the ominous music folks that is a consummate
[03:09:30.580 --> 03:09:37.580]  insider deciding that she can't take it any longer and she goes public what is
[03:09:37.580 --> 03:09:43.580]  she saying basically she is saying that by and large what you read in medical
[03:09:43.580 --> 03:09:52.580]  journals is a fraud a complete fraud that would include clinical trials of
[03:09:52.580 --> 03:09:57.580]  medical drugs that are supposed to be safe and effective when in fact they are
[03:09:57.580 --> 03:10:08.580]  disabling toxic and destructive that's what she's fessing up to let's take one
[03:10:08.580 --> 03:10:15.580]  more here from the pile let me just read the quote part of it and then I'll give
[03:10:15.580 --> 03:10:21.580]  you the source the case against science is straightforward much of the
[03:10:21.580 --> 03:10:29.580]  scientific literature perhaps half may simply be untrue afflicted by studies
[03:10:29.580 --> 03:10:37.580]  with small sample sizes tiny effects invalid exploratory analyses and flagrant
[03:10:37.580 --> 03:10:44.580]  conflicts of interest together with an obsession for pursuing fashionable
[03:10:44.580 --> 03:10:53.580]  trends of dubious importance science has taken a turn toward darkness that ain't
[03:10:53.580 --> 03:11:02.580]  me that's not me talking that is dr. Richard Horton editor in chief of the
[03:11:02.580 --> 03:11:08.580]  Lancet which is again one of the most prestigious medical journals in the
[03:11:08.580 --> 03:11:18.580]  world a statement he made in April of 2015 getting the message here this is
[03:11:18.580 --> 03:11:30.580]  absolutely incredible insiders coming out and confessing and so I say well if all
[03:11:30.580 --> 03:11:35.580]  of this medical literature is fake and false and fake news and the clinical
[03:11:35.580 --> 03:11:43.580]  trials of these wondrous drugs are faked and false and incompetent then we ought
[03:11:43.580 --> 03:11:51.580]  to be seeing widespread destruction from medical drugs because of the flagrant
[03:11:51.580 --> 03:11:57.580]  fraudulence at which point people who only get their news from mainstream
[03:11:57.580 --> 03:12:02.580]  television would say well I see no evidence of a widespread medical scandal
[03:12:02.580 --> 03:12:09.580]  yeah well there is there is where where is it reported in the open source
[03:12:09.580 --> 03:12:17.580]  medical literature July 26 2000 Journal of the American Medical Association
[03:12:17.580 --> 03:12:27.580]  again insiders are fessing up dr. Barbara Starfield a revered public health expert
[03:12:27.580 --> 03:12:32.580]  at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health writes a review is US health really
[03:12:32.580 --> 03:12:38.580]  the best in the world and one of her shocking conclusions among several is
[03:12:38.580 --> 03:12:44.580]  that every year in the US correctly prescribed FDA approved medical drugs
[03:12:44.580 --> 03:12:52.580]  kill 106,000 people thus every decade these drugs kill more than a million
[03:12:52.580 --> 03:13:04.580]  people in the US wrap your mind around that if you can that is exactly what we
[03:13:04.580 --> 03:13:12.580]  would predict after hearing those two insiders dr. Engel and dr. Horton of these
[03:13:12.580 --> 03:13:18.580]  two prestigious medical journals talk about medical fraud and to add my
[03:13:18.580 --> 03:13:27.580]  commentary to it this is also exactly what we would expect from the medical
[03:13:27.580 --> 03:13:33.580]  cartel which is the most toxic arm of the globalist enterprise to take over the
[03:13:33.580 --> 03:13:40.580]  planet because again if you're going to soften up the population if you're
[03:13:40.580 --> 03:13:44.580]  going to make people incapable of thinking or reasoning or getting an
[03:13:44.580 --> 03:13:51.580]  education if it's offered to them or knowing what's what being able to look
[03:13:51.580 --> 03:13:59.580]  down below the fake news to see the real news to be able to resist to be able to
[03:13:59.580 --> 03:14:04.580]  stand their ground to be able to have courage if you want to eliminate all of
[03:14:04.580 --> 03:14:13.580]  that not just here and there and now and then but on a continuous ongoing basis
[03:14:13.580 --> 03:14:19.580]  what are you going to do you're going to get people to go to their doctor all the
[03:14:19.580 --> 03:14:24.580]  time you're going to have drug ad after drug ad on television convincing people
[03:14:24.580 --> 03:14:30.580]  that this is the only way to treat their symptoms if they want to remain healthy
[03:14:30.580 --> 03:14:34.580]  they have to get these drugs they have to go to the doctor they have to ask a
[03:14:34.580 --> 03:14:43.580]  doctor if they have drug is right for you because this provides the endless
[03:14:43.580 --> 03:14:52.580]  bleak trail from cradle to grave of medical cartel toxic debilitating
[03:14:52.580 --> 03:15:00.580]  destroying treatments of every kind imaginable for every kind of disease
[03:15:00.580 --> 03:15:10.580]  you could imagine many many of which are fake to begin with to weaken and soften
[03:15:10.580 --> 03:15:23.580]  populations that's the game that's the deal we'll be back after the break
[03:15:23.580 --> 03:15:31.580]  defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's Alex Jones

[03:21:03.580 --> 03:21:11.580]  weaponizing the stock market that's an interesting idea isn't it how do you do
[03:21:11.580 --> 03:21:20.580]  that why is it important dig in deep on this one folks this applies to Trump but
[03:21:20.580 --> 03:21:29.580]  it applies to every other president as well if you control the stock market you
[03:21:29.580 --> 03:21:39.580]  control the perception underlined 100 times of how the overall economy is doing
[03:21:39.580 --> 03:21:47.580]  okay despite the fact that the stock market by and large is a giant Vegas
[03:21:47.580 --> 03:21:56.580]  casino and has nothing to do with how the overall economy is doing you've got to
[03:21:56.580 --> 03:22:05.580]  get that idea through your noggin yes when a company decides to go public and
[03:22:05.580 --> 03:22:12.580]  issues was called an initial public offering or an IPO the money from the
[03:22:12.580 --> 03:22:18.580]  sale of that stock during a limited time period does go back to the company so
[03:22:18.580 --> 03:22:28.580]  that they can expand but by and large the overwhelming majority of activity in
[03:22:28.580 --> 03:22:34.580]  this giant casino called the stock market is buy and sell buy and sell buy
[03:22:34.580 --> 03:22:38.580]  and sell buy and sell put down your bets are you betting the stock is going to go
[03:22:38.580 --> 03:22:46.580]  up or it's going to go down place your bets folks here we go and like any Vegas
[03:22:46.580 --> 03:22:55.580]  casino operation there is an advantage for the house but in this case in the
[03:22:55.580 --> 03:23:02.580]  stock market we're talking about something even more severe the advantage for
[03:23:02.580 --> 03:23:10.580]  the insiders is monumental because they basically rigged the game they can take
[03:23:10.580 --> 03:23:16.580]  a stock up and they can push it down they can take the overall stock market up
[03:23:16.580 --> 03:23:22.580]  or they can push it down they can take this precious thing called the Dow
[03:23:22.580 --> 03:23:30.580]  industrial average stock average and send it up or take it down and then all of
[03:23:30.580 --> 03:23:38.580]  the pundits climb on board and they begin to spew their garbage about what the
[03:23:38.580 --> 03:23:48.580]  direction of the stock market means in terms of the overall economy that's how
[03:23:48.580 --> 03:23:57.580]  you control the president because if the performance of the stock market is
[03:23:57.580 --> 03:24:03.580]  perceived to be a reflection of the overall economy and the president
[03:24:03.580 --> 03:24:09.580]  sitting in the White House has economic policies then by taking the stock market
[03:24:09.580 --> 03:24:15.580]  down if they want to the insiders can then just simply point at the president
[03:24:15.580 --> 03:24:20.580]  and say this is why not only the stock market is going down but the overall
[03:24:20.580 --> 03:24:28.580]  economy is down when as I pointed out here at the top the gigantic casino
[03:24:28.580 --> 03:24:34.580]  called the stock market has nothing to do with the overall economy which has to
[03:24:34.580 --> 03:24:40.580]  do with production which has to do with sales which has to do with certain key
[03:24:40.580 --> 03:24:49.580]  industries etc etc etc not about selling and buying stocks in the casino
[03:24:49.580 --> 03:24:58.580]  so many people noticed when Trump was elected that he surrounded himself with
[03:24:58.580 --> 03:25:05.580]  key Goldman Sachs people Goldman Sachs is you know what are you going to call
[03:25:05.580 --> 03:25:16.580]  it the giant squid as has been used one of the largest investment banks
[03:25:16.580 --> 03:25:25.580]  financial behemoths in the world what was Trump doing what would any president
[03:25:25.580 --> 03:25:31.580]  be doing by surrounding himself with Goldman Sachs people making a deal
[03:25:31.580 --> 03:25:38.580]  making a deal to protect himself and what he intended to do and basically
[03:25:38.580 --> 03:25:43.580]  the deal was this Goldman Sachs said look Mr. President we can keep the stock
[03:25:43.580 --> 03:25:53.580]  market up for you we can do that and by doing that we will create the perception
[03:25:53.580 --> 03:25:59.580]  that the economy is doing well now you have to actually come in behind that
[03:25:59.580 --> 03:26:08.580]  with policies that in reality make the economy do well that's your business
[03:26:08.580 --> 03:26:14.580]  we have no problem with that but since that has nothing to do with the stock
[03:26:14.580 --> 03:26:21.580]  market we can keep the stock market up for you thus creating the perception
[03:26:21.580 --> 03:26:29.580]  that you're doing a good job because if it goes down way down everybody and
[03:26:29.580 --> 03:26:34.580]  his brother is going to say you're the reason why Mr. President and your
[03:26:34.580 --> 03:26:42.580]  presidency is going to crash on the rocks Trump understands that every president
[03:26:42.580 --> 03:26:52.580]  gets that it's not a mystery to those people but it's a mystery to the public
[03:26:52.580 --> 03:26:58.580]  now you recently saw two episodes one Trump said that he was going to lay on
[03:26:58.580 --> 03:27:07.580]  tariffs 25% on steel coming into the country and 10% on aluminum this was
[03:27:07.580 --> 03:27:15.580]  perhaps a major signal that Trump was going to double down on his anti-globalist
[03:27:15.580 --> 03:27:24.580]  economic policy because for globalists there must be no tariffs mega
[03:27:24.580 --> 03:27:31.580]  corporations must be able to roam the international landscape like dinosaurs
[03:27:31.580 --> 03:27:38.580]  of old picking up cash and assets putting in investments taking out investments
[03:27:38.580 --> 03:27:44.580]  closing down factories and industrial countries and taking them to hell
[03:27:44.580 --> 03:27:49.580]  holes where the same products can be produced at a tiny fraction of the
[03:27:49.580 --> 03:27:54.580]  cost as slave wages with no environmental protection for workers
[03:27:54.580 --> 03:28:01.580]  whatsoever and no tariffs on these products coming back into the country
[03:28:01.580 --> 03:28:07.580]  which is sheer insanity that's how to destroy an economy which is what globalists
[03:28:07.580 --> 03:28:12.580]  obviously intend to do in the industrial countries and they're well underway
[03:28:12.580 --> 03:28:39.580]  got that or when we come back on info

[03:32:52.580 --> 03:33:02.580]  the answer to nineteen eighty four is seventeen seventy six you're listening
[03:33:02.580 --> 03:33:07.580]  to the alex jones show
[03:33:07.580 --> 03:33:12.580]  john mack report back in the fourth hour sitting in for alex here
[03:33:12.580 --> 03:33:17.580]  and here's where i left it off told you to put your thinking cap on because
[03:33:17.580 --> 03:33:24.580]  this is serious stuff the globalists want no tariffs on any product anywhere in
[03:33:24.580 --> 03:33:31.580]  the world to benefit their mega corporate agendas so that means ridiculously
[03:33:31.580 --> 03:33:38.580]  that a company in the americas or any industrialized nation shut down their
[03:33:38.580 --> 03:33:44.580]  factory fire their workers take their factory to some hellhole where they can
[03:33:44.580 --> 03:33:49.580]  pay workers three cents an hour and there is no environmental protection for
[03:33:49.580 --> 03:33:56.580]  those workers whatsoever manufacture the product at a tiny cost bring them on
[03:33:56.580 --> 03:34:02.580]  back bring those products back to the original countries that they left
[03:34:02.580 --> 03:34:07.580]  under cutting more competitors destroying more business wrecking more
[03:34:07.580 --> 03:34:13.580]  economies throwing more people out of work this is globalism
[03:34:13.580 --> 03:34:19.580]  so whenever the globalists here that a president is going to lay on tariffs
[03:34:19.580 --> 03:34:26.580]  what does that mean well that means okay boys if you who are manufacturing say
[03:34:26.580 --> 03:34:33.580]  steel in some far nation want to export that steel to america and sell it here
[03:34:33.580 --> 03:34:39.580]  all right but we're going to charge you an additional twenty five percent to
[03:34:39.580 --> 03:34:46.580]  sell it in america to level the playing field with domestic producers of steel
[03:34:46.580 --> 03:34:53.580]  only fair globalists don't like it absolutely not they don't like that at
[03:34:53.580 --> 03:35:00.580]  all they take that as a very very bad sign i would contend that's really why
[03:35:00.580 --> 03:35:06.580]  they got bichard nixon out of the white house there's a long history to that
[03:35:06.580 --> 03:35:11.580]  nixon started to do the same thing he started to protect a few industries in
[03:35:11.580 --> 03:35:19.580]  america and began to lay on tariffs on imported goods globalists don't like
[03:35:19.580 --> 03:35:26.580]  that that's not their agenda they stand for mega corporate license as
[03:35:26.580 --> 03:35:35.580]  opposed to freedom to roam the world and destroy while making billions of
[03:35:35.580 --> 03:35:42.580]  trillions in the process so that's what trump announced he said twenty five
[03:35:42.580 --> 03:35:50.580]  percent tariff on steel ten percent on aluminum and then gary cone chief
[03:35:50.580 --> 03:35:59.580]  economic advisor to the president resigned who is gary cone well he is the
[03:35:59.580 --> 03:36:13.580]  past president and ceo of drumroll goldman sax goldman sax who in the last
[03:36:13.580 --> 03:36:21.580]  segment i indicated trump had made a deal with goldman sax said to trump we
[03:36:21.580 --> 03:36:27.580]  can maintain the perception that the u.s. economy is strong by keeping the stock
[03:36:27.580 --> 03:36:33.580]  market up hey we know the stock market giant casino has nothing to do with
[03:36:33.580 --> 03:36:38.580]  the economy the real economy but everybody thinks it does that's the
[03:36:38.580 --> 03:36:43.580]  perception so you need somebody mr. president to keep the stock market up
[03:36:43.580 --> 03:36:52.580]  and we can do that for you unless you start doing things that you know rub us
[03:36:52.580 --> 03:36:58.580]  the wrong way that really begin to make a deep incursion against the globalist
[03:36:58.580 --> 03:37:04.580]  agenda in which case we could bail on you and do something different with the
[03:37:04.580 --> 03:37:13.580]  stock market gary cone resigns former president and ceo of goldman sax he
[03:37:13.580 --> 03:37:20.580]  resigns as trump economic advisor stock market begins to get wobbly and go down
[03:37:20.580 --> 03:37:25.580]  come back at wobbly go down again back and of course what do all the pundits
[03:37:25.580 --> 03:37:34.580]  say whoa this is a very bad sign it's reflecting overall trouble in the
[03:37:34.580 --> 03:37:42.580]  economy in america and trade wars on the horizon etc etc etc doom gloom big
[03:37:42.580 --> 03:37:48.580]  clouds ominously overhead will last their job that's what they're supposed to do
[03:37:48.580 --> 03:37:56.580]  to keep the globalist agenda on track is to maintain this mind control equation
[03:37:56.580 --> 03:38:03.580]  between the performance of a giant insider rigged casino called the stock
[03:38:03.580 --> 03:38:13.580]  market and the real overall economy and its performance understand that so what
[03:38:13.580 --> 03:38:20.580]  will we see now remains to be seen what is goldman sax thinking what are they
[03:38:20.580 --> 03:38:28.580]  saying how far do they want to go in torpedoing the perception that the US
[03:38:28.580 --> 03:38:35.580]  economy is recovering and doing well we'll find out but that's the game
[03:38:35.580 --> 03:38:42.580]  that's the way the game is played folks every president faces the same situation
[03:38:42.580 --> 03:38:55.580]  making a deal with somebody who can keep the stock market up it happens it's
[03:38:55.580 --> 03:39:03.580]  happened it's going to keep happening so we'll see where this goes compromises
[03:39:03.580 --> 03:39:07.580]  are often made and then the stock market comes back up again is that going to
[03:39:07.580 --> 03:39:15.580]  happen here we don't know but golden sacks is to a degree running the show
[03:39:15.580 --> 03:39:23.580]  and that is a globalist show on the other hand trump has pointed out and other
[03:39:23.580 --> 03:39:31.580]  people have pointed out to trade wars disagreements now between countries about
[03:39:31.580 --> 03:39:38.580]  who's going to lay tariffs on which products etc etc is that a desperate
[03:39:38.580 --> 03:39:43.580]  horrible thing that signals the end of the world no not at all it's all part
[03:39:43.580 --> 03:39:51.580]  of a process of sorting out the ruin this globalist economic policies of
[03:39:51.580 --> 03:39:58.580]  decades in America and other nations that have torpedoed their economies there
[03:39:58.580 --> 03:40:05.580]  has to be a reshuffling of trade agreements so that the industrial
[03:40:05.580 --> 03:40:11.580]  companies do not take the short end of the stick you want to call that trade
[03:40:11.580 --> 03:40:16.580]  wars yeah you could promote that and of course the pundits in the mainstream
[03:40:16.580 --> 03:40:24.580]  press and the financial sold out pawns called financial reporters are slanting
[03:40:24.580 --> 03:40:30.580]  the story that way oh oh the trade wars are coming the trade wars are coming a
[03:40:30.580 --> 03:40:37.580]  reshuffling could be coming which if it does is a very good thing to put back
[03:40:37.580 --> 03:40:45.580]  on track saying economic policies that have to do with tariffs and fairness in
[03:40:45.580 --> 03:40:51.580]  trade so that America and other industrialized countries are not just
[03:40:51.580 --> 03:40:59.580]  absorbing absorbing absorbing and letting corporations flee to far-flung
[03:40:59.580 --> 03:41:07.580]  areas where they produce products for virtually nothing okay grab on to that
[03:41:07.580 --> 03:41:14.580]  story research and investigate it dig into it because you're going to see that
[03:41:14.580 --> 03:41:22.580]  in the mainstream lying fake news press it's all the time every day everywhere
[03:41:22.580 --> 03:41:30.580]  the performance of the stock market is the performance of the economy total
[03:41:30.580 --> 03:41:38.580]  BS total lie aimed at being able to control any president who sits in the
[03:41:38.580 --> 03:41:46.580]  White House okay I reported on the story some months ago and in for wars and
[03:41:46.580 --> 03:41:52.580]  elsewhere about the next generation of vaccines this is crucial to understand
[03:41:52.580 --> 03:42:00.580]  because it's preceding a pace clinical studies are underway we could soon see
[03:42:00.580 --> 03:42:08.580]  some kind of approval for the next generation of vaccines which are going
[03:42:08.580 --> 03:42:14.580]  to be far more dangerous threat than what we've got now stay with me after the
[03:42:14.580 --> 03:42:42.580]  break I'll go into it John Rappaport for info war I'm so excited the new product
[03:42:42.580 --> 03:42:47.580]  info wars live calm in a glass bottle two months servings filled to the brim

[03:42:58.580 --> 03:43:04.580]  because it's beyond that quite frankly I just went off what I saw medical doctors
[03:43:04.580 --> 03:43:08.580]  prescribing to their patients but it wasn't prescription but they were charging
[03:43:08.580 --> 03:43:13.580]  people a hundred two hundred dollars for the formulae and I came up with our own
[03:43:13.580 --> 03:43:18.580]  formulae working with some scientists and developers non-gmo made right here in
[03:43:18.580 --> 03:43:24.580]  America 120 capsules and ladies and gentlemen you add the preglinone to it

[03:44:57.580 --> 03:45:01.580]  is its proprietary process and technology that disperses more kinetic energy
[03:45:01.580 --> 03:45:05.580]  at a rate higher than any other traditional body armor using one of the strongest
[03:45:05.580 --> 03:45:09.580]  synthetic materials ever created called ultra high molecular weight polyethylene
[03:45:09.580 --> 03:45:13.580]  defender armor is also super compact and lightweight there's a reason the
[03:45:13.580 --> 03:45:17.580]  department of defense chose defender to manufacture their new line of advanced
[03:45:17.580 --> 03:45:22.580]  lightweight armor it works defender body armor is made right here in America

[03:45:43.580 --> 03:45:48.580]  they use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler
[03:45:48.580 --> 03:45:52.580]  they use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat
[03:45:52.580 --> 03:45:57.580]  their narrative over and over again and then they use their ex president to endorse
[03:45:57.580 --> 03:46:02.580]  the resistance all to make them march make them protest make them scream
[03:46:02.580 --> 03:46:08.580]  racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia to smash windows burn cars
[03:46:08.580 --> 03:46:13.580]  shut down interstates and airports bully and terrorize the law abiding until the
[03:46:13.580 --> 03:46:19.580]  only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness and when
[03:46:19.580 --> 03:46:24.580]  that happens they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage the only way we stop
[03:46:24.580 --> 03:46:30.580]  this the only way we save our country and our freedom is to fight this violence
[03:46:30.580 --> 03:46:36.580]  of lies with a clenched fist of truth I'm the National Rifle Association of
[03:46:36.580 --> 03:46:47.580]  America and I'm freedom's safest place you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[03:46:47.580 --> 03:46:50.580]  you
[03:47:03.580 --> 03:47:09.580]  John Rappaport in our last segment the fourth hour sitting in for Alex you know
[03:47:09.580 --> 03:47:19.580]  it occurs to me that today's know nothing rebels underline know nothing
[03:47:19.580 --> 03:47:29.580]  know nothing their fathers and their mothers some of them and their grandparents
[03:47:29.580 --> 03:47:35.580]  were the ones back in the 60s and 70s that were saying never trust the
[03:47:35.580 --> 03:47:43.580]  government never trust the government and now whether these know nothing
[03:47:43.580 --> 03:47:50.580]  rebels know it or not they are protesting and rioting and trying to suppress
[03:47:50.580 --> 03:47:57.580]  free speech on behalf of the government they are the ultimate government
[03:47:57.580 --> 03:48:02.580]  trusters they're putting all their eggs in that basket that's where they're
[03:48:02.580 --> 03:48:09.580]  going and they somehow think of this as a rebellion really now really how
[03:48:09.580 --> 03:48:17.580]  ignorant can you possibly get how ignorant can you possibly get and in fact
[03:48:17.580 --> 03:48:24.580]  if you look at various shows on television that are trying to parody truth
[03:48:24.580 --> 03:48:33.580]  tellers independent media people etc these days they usually bring this factor
[03:48:33.580 --> 03:48:40.580]  up you see they have their version of the independent media truth teller
[03:48:40.580 --> 03:48:48.580]  saying don't trust the government folks as if well now we know that he's
[03:48:48.580 --> 03:48:54.580]  completely crazy now we know that he's trying to lead people down the wrong
[03:48:54.580 --> 03:49:05.580]  path now we know that he's lying falsifying because above all the
[03:49:05.580 --> 03:49:13.580]  righteous path is trust the government really now is that right is that right
[03:49:13.580 --> 03:49:20.580]  you can read two three four hundred books written out of the 1960s and 70s
[03:49:20.580 --> 03:49:26.580]  and 80s by defectors and whistleblowers and so forth and so on that all carry
[03:49:26.580 --> 03:49:31.580]  the same explosive message based on my experience and what I discovered when
[03:49:31.580 --> 03:49:38.580]  I was working for this agency or that agency is don't trust the government
[03:49:38.580 --> 03:49:46.580]  whatever you do don't trust the government but this is now well he might be a
[03:49:46.580 --> 03:49:50.580]  terrorist because he's saying don't trust the government where did that
[03:49:50.580 --> 03:49:58.580]  equation come from where did that equation come from let's see if he says
[03:49:58.580 --> 03:50:03.580]  don't trust the government she he's right next door on the verge of becoming a
[03:50:03.580 --> 03:50:12.580]  terrorist so that would be Jefferson Madison Thomas Payne Alexander Hamilton
[03:50:12.580 --> 03:50:17.580]  and the rest of the people who participated in the Declaration of
[03:50:17.580 --> 03:50:22.580]  Independence in the Constitution because strangely enough you know as it turns
[03:50:22.580 --> 03:50:31.580]  out they didn't trust the government no no that's right they didn't they didn't
[03:50:31.580 --> 03:50:35.580]  trust the government they had experience with European governments and when they
[03:50:35.580 --> 03:50:44.580]  founded this one they said the core principle has to be has to be severely
[03:50:44.580 --> 03:50:51.580]  limiting the reach and the power and the potential oppression of centralized
[03:50:51.580 --> 03:51:00.580]  power meaning the new federal government they didn't trust central government
[03:51:00.580 --> 03:51:05.580]  that's why they founded the American Republic so I guess that made him
[03:51:05.580 --> 03:51:10.580]  terrorists to obviously well sure just a bunch of terrorists you know flinging
[03:51:10.580 --> 03:51:20.580]  words around and what good are they that would be the conclusion today in
[03:51:20.580 --> 03:51:28.580]  2018 the FBI arrested the reincarnation of James Madison and put him in prison
[03:51:28.580 --> 03:51:37.580]  awaiting trial for acts of terrorism namely the framing of a document called
[03:51:37.580 --> 03:51:45.580]  the Constitution which forms something called the American Republic Madison is
[03:51:45.580 --> 03:51:53.580]  certainly going to serve a long-term in prison at the very least that would be
[03:51:53.580 --> 03:52:02.580]  the judgment so let's take a sharp turn here and go to technocracy which is one
[03:52:02.580 --> 03:52:08.580]  of the great arms of the current oppression oligarchical oppression of
[03:52:08.580 --> 03:52:15.580]  human life dedicated to central power central power central government such
[03:52:15.580 --> 03:52:19.580]  a degree that it rules the entire planet as if it's one nation and I'm talking
[03:52:19.580 --> 03:52:24.580]  about the next generation of vaccines which are called DNA vaccines and they
[03:52:24.580 --> 03:52:30.580]  are currently being studied in clinical trials and soon you could see the approval
[03:52:30.580 --> 03:52:41.580]  of the first of these DNA vaccines in brief this is what they do genes are
[03:52:41.580 --> 03:52:52.580]  synthesized and then injected into the body carried by viruses it's like let's
[03:52:52.580 --> 03:52:57.580]  load these synthetic genes on this little airplane called a virus shoot it
[03:52:57.580 --> 03:53:03.580]  into the body because we have decided that it will protect this person against
[03:53:03.580 --> 03:53:08.580]  disease X whatever it is this is a major breakthrough in the next generation of
[03:53:08.580 --> 03:53:13.580]  vaccines well we already know that the globalist program of vaccination
[03:53:13.580 --> 03:53:19.580]  worldwide has been exposed many many many times and we're not on the defense in
[03:53:19.580 --> 03:53:26.580]  this we are on the offense these products are incredibly toxic and harmful to
[03:53:26.580 --> 03:53:32.580]  human life period they have no basis in scientific knowledge in the way that
[03:53:32.580 --> 03:53:38.580]  they are supposed to be acting to create immunity and they are a gigantic toxic
[03:53:38.580 --> 03:53:44.580]  host hoax so the next generation is even going to be worse because do you know
[03:53:44.580 --> 03:53:49.580]  what's going to happen when these genes are injected into the human body these
[03:53:49.580 --> 03:54:00.580]  synthetic genes they are going to form a new part of an individual's permanent
[03:54:00.580 --> 03:54:11.580]  genetic makeup permanent genetic makeup not just a visit a resident the man who
[03:54:11.580 --> 03:54:17.580]  came to dinner and never left that's the way this whole operation is supposed to
[03:54:17.580 --> 03:54:24.580]  work I cited when I first started writing about this an article in the
[03:54:24.580 --> 03:54:29.580]  New York Times that just openly admitted the whole thing and they decided to
[03:54:29.580 --> 03:54:33.580]  get a comment on this from a Nobel Prize winner named David Baltimore and they
[03:54:33.580 --> 03:54:37.580]  said what do you think of this he said oh yeah sure uh-huh he said but you know
[03:54:37.580 --> 03:54:44.580]  it's it wouldn't be surprising if some people objected to the idea of permanently
[03:54:44.580 --> 03:54:52.580]  altering their DNA really you think so huh you think that might happen when
[03:54:52.580 --> 03:55:00.580]  people become aware that just over the hill approaching us is purportedly the
[03:55:00.580 --> 03:55:06.580]  next generation of vaccines which are DNA altering on a permanent basis with no
[03:55:06.580 --> 03:55:13.580]  guarantee by the way no guarantee absolutely that these vaccines will do
[03:55:13.580 --> 03:55:19.580]  anything to create immunity that will be the selling point that's what will be
[03:55:19.580 --> 03:55:24.580]  told oh this is a fantastic advance over the older forms of vaccination and so
[03:55:24.580 --> 03:55:29.580]  far as good as they were mind you oh yes this is much better it's much cleaner
[03:55:29.580 --> 03:55:38.580]  it's much safer etc etc of course there is this one little factor you know we
[03:55:38.580 --> 03:55:43.580]  we pretty much need to tell you this and that is that your DNA is going to be
[03:55:43.580 --> 03:55:50.580]  permanently altered and since that's the case then you will be passing down
[03:55:50.580 --> 03:55:57.580]  this altered configuration of your own genetic makeup to the next generation
[03:55:57.580 --> 03:56:04.580]  and so on and so forth and that will be true for every human on the planet who
[03:56:04.580 --> 03:56:11.580]  receives this innovative new type of vaccine so what are they saying
[03:56:11.580 --> 03:56:21.580]  basically they're saying we're here to alter your DNA that's it you know if you
[03:56:21.580 --> 03:56:26.580]  want to just reduce it down to the bare bones or what they're saying that's it
[03:56:26.580 --> 03:56:32.580]  hi we're the experts and we're here to alter your DNA no problem right you
[03:56:32.580 --> 03:56:42.580]  don't have a problem with this do you well actually I do actually I do I don't
[03:56:42.580 --> 03:56:48.580]  think anybody should be able to alter my DNA in fact these heralded ethicists you
[03:56:48.580 --> 03:56:52.580]  know in modern medicine who argue in debate in journals and talk about the
[03:56:52.580 --> 03:56:56.580]  dangers of this and that and the other thing why aren't they up on their hind
[03:56:56.580 --> 03:57:04.580]  legs screaming and yelling from rooftops hey they're going to alter your DNA
[03:57:04.580 --> 03:57:10.580]  that's our last segment folks good to be back here at info wars John Rappaport
