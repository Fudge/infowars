[00:00.000 --> 00:11.920]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:11.920 --> 00:36.640]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:36.640 --> 00:42.640]  T-party billionaires think attack ads can cover the truth Joe Garcia is working to fix
[00:42.640 --> 00:47.040]  Obamacare he voted to let you keep your existing health plan and took the White
[00:47.040 --> 00:51.360]  House to task for the disastrous healthcare website and Joe Garcia fought
[00:51.360 --> 00:55.040]  to hold the insurance companies accountable so they can't deny coverage
[00:55.040 --> 00:59.520]  for pre-existing conditions or drop coverage when you get sick attack ads
[00:59.520 --> 01:04.460]  can't change the truth Joe Garcia is doing what's right for Florida house
[01:04.460 --> 01:08.760]  majority tax responsible for the content of this ad that's right the
[01:08.760 --> 01:14.760]  Democrats are now running ads against themselves but this is all Democratic
[01:14.760 --> 01:19.080]  Party strategy being tested in Florida you can guarantee it because Obama
[01:19.080 --> 01:23.840]  himself is now saying hey I know how to fix Obamacare make me a dictator and he's
[01:23.840 --> 01:29.280]  changed scores of provisions of it that is completely illegal to do completely
[01:29.280 --> 01:33.440]  outside of law so they create the train wreck and then offer the solution and
[01:33.440 --> 01:43.920]  finally mainline even Democrat controlled media is admitting that Obamacare was
[01:43.920 --> 01:47.880]  designed to fail and that the website doesn't work because they don't want you
[01:47.880 --> 01:53.840]  to know what a screw job it is they want to make it about oh we had a mess up we
[01:53.840 --> 01:56.400]  had a problem and I've learned their tricks fucks they've only got about 10
[01:56.400 --> 02:00.920]  of them and the Republicans play the same games but they're just the loyal
[02:00.920 --> 02:06.760]  opposition in the supposed opposition to the takeover that's the Republican
[02:06.760 --> 02:09.760]  leadership's job but they're bought and paid for by the very same offshore
[02:09.760 --> 02:13.360]  interest the robber barons and so of course you keep getting the same
[02:13.360 --> 02:16.840]  outcomes though you get different rhetoric it's all about tricking people
[02:16.840 --> 02:20.680]  but it's not going to work forever if my voice sounds like it's out of it I went
[02:20.680 --> 02:25.560]  shooting 50 cows did a lot of shooting Sunday and I was with Weldon and some
[02:25.560 --> 02:29.880]  friends and he said Alex you know you're not supposed to breathe you hold your
[02:29.880 --> 02:32.200]  breath when you shoot and then you breathe in around you pull a trigger I
[02:32.200 --> 02:37.240]  can see you blowing smoke out like you're smoking a cigarette and by the
[02:37.240 --> 02:40.440]  time I was driving home I had a sore throat from it I was like coughing some
[02:40.440 --> 02:44.760]  blood up this morning not that big of a deal it's just a big irritant and a
[02:44.760 --> 02:49.560]  little bit of stuff going on in my bronchioles and it should get better very
[02:49.560 --> 02:54.720]  very quickly but I'm not trying to sound like Batman
[02:54.720 --> 03:05.600]  Bruce Wayne that's the sound like but I do have some guests coming on the
[03:05.600 --> 03:11.000]  broadcast we have Paul Craig Roberts on what's happening with the economy and
[03:11.000 --> 03:18.480]  QE unlimited being somewhat slowed down and always interesting Gerald Solinte
[03:18.480 --> 03:22.760]  will be popping in and I promise that means the crew has to make me do this if
[03:22.760 --> 03:27.160]  I forget and go into perseveration take a lot of your phone calls today that way
[03:27.160 --> 03:31.560]  I can also save my voice while trying to concisely get to some of the news and
[03:31.560 --> 03:34.840]  believe me there is a lot of it today so I'm gonna go ahead and give the phone
[03:34.840 --> 03:39.320]  number out for first-time callers right now and if you'd like to comment on

[03:47.760 --> 03:51.200]  increments fractionally by actually trying to go to your calls move the next
[03:51.200 --> 03:55.600]  person at least in the first few rounds other people sit there on purgatory
[03:55.600 --> 04:06.680]  hold but trapped in purgatory awaiting the hour of reprisal your time slips away
[04:06.680 --> 04:18.080]  so the point is 800 259 92 31 800 259 92 31 and this voice literally sounds like
[04:18.080 --> 04:26.600]  someone trying to act like the voice of God the NFL announcer president Camacho
[04:26.600 --> 04:32.800]  people got stupider and stupider over the next 300 years until the average IQ

[10:10.520 --> 10:14.600]  my again I love guns ladies and gentlemen and I usually am under better
[10:14.600 --> 10:19.200]  discipline when I'm not shooting with Shane Steiner and folks 50 cows and you
[10:19.200 --> 10:22.640]  know you do not breathe when you pull the trigger on those because it's basically
[10:22.640 --> 10:28.400]  light artillery and it's just incredible nauseous smoke that comes back burns
[10:28.400 --> 10:32.880]  your eyes you name it especially the winds blow on your face and I basically
[10:32.880 --> 10:38.120]  unintentionally huffed about a hundred rounds of 50 cows Sunday and I am going
[10:38.120 --> 10:42.840]  through the aftermath of it right now I stopped about 10 into it I was going to
[10:42.840 --> 10:46.400]  the second clip and Weldon was we had double fifties going and he was like
[10:46.400 --> 10:54.040]  Alex I just saw you exhale smoke there was like judge he was shooting to and
[10:54.040 --> 10:57.120]  we're like none of them I remember not to breathe and I looked at him and he
[10:57.120 --> 11:03.320]  excelled I didn't give him a call so yeah he's doing but it's some new ammo too
[11:03.320 --> 11:07.320]  because I know I've huffed it before and hadn't done this to me but I don't want
[11:07.320 --> 11:10.880]  to turn the entire broadcast into a discussion of that I'm just letting you
[11:10.880 --> 11:13.960]  know up front what's going on
[11:16.360 --> 11:20.960]  man I tell you it's just insane and I'm never able to just read the headlines
[11:20.960 --> 11:28.280]  but I'm gonna do it today right now took the cough button out of here to put the
[11:28.280 --> 11:32.440]  new one in it had a malfunction last week so I guess you have to hear me cough
[11:32.440 --> 11:38.680]  today I probably should have thrown in the towel and taken off but I just loved
[11:38.680 --> 11:42.120]  doing the radio broadcast so I'm gonna try it here we're gonna try it we're gonna
[11:42.120 --> 11:44.840]  open the phones up whatever issue you want to discuss but I'm just gonna kind
[11:44.840 --> 11:46.880]  of let you have your comment you probably don't want to call them with
[11:46.880 --> 11:50.160]  questions Paul Craig Roberts is gonna love it because I'll probably shut up with
[11:50.160 --> 11:54.280]  the first time in my life and that Joe Salante is coming up as well today so
[11:54.280 --> 11:58.040]  we'll see what happens with that
[11:59.920 --> 12:06.280]  all right where to start let me just let me just in the interest of the
[12:06.280 --> 12:09.760]  interest of news just the reason I can ever get to the news I'm trying to
[12:09.760 --> 12:14.040]  figure out what's most important and literally I'm like a dog in a butcher shop
[12:14.040 --> 12:18.480]  and with just all the important news and I don't know which giant piece of meat
[12:18.480 --> 12:23.080]  to sink my fangs into first you know it's almost like a deer in the headlights
[12:23.080 --> 12:25.840]  mode I think that's their intention but right now let's just give you the
[12:25.840 --> 12:31.000]  headlines survey US press freedom plunges under Obama the 46th in the
[12:31.000 --> 12:35.840]  world after Romania gotta love that that's out of the Washington Times this
[12:35.840 --> 12:40.440]  out of the times of Israel Iran we're ready for decisive battle with Israel
[12:40.440 --> 12:46.320]  US and again folks I've been against attacking Iran offensively I don't want
[12:46.320 --> 12:50.040]  World War 3 but now I saw people criticizing me on info wars in the
[12:50.040 --> 12:54.200]  comments and on the YouTubes from a few days ago when they were showing
[12:54.200 --> 12:58.600]  simulated videos of blowing up Tel Aviv and US aircraft carriers preemptively
[12:58.600 --> 13:05.120]  I mean that's really asking for it and so I'm saying why are they doing that
[13:05.120 --> 13:08.840]  because their government wants to stay in power and needs war rhetoric because
[13:08.840 --> 13:11.920]  they're very unpopular and our governments want the war rhetoric to stay
[13:11.920 --> 13:16.560]  in power the Likudniks the military-industrial complex over here and
[13:16.560 --> 13:21.160]  it's just that some people are not sophisticated enough to get I'm on the
[13:21.160 --> 13:26.360]  side of anti-World War 3 I'm on the side of prospering live long and
[13:26.360 --> 13:31.440]  prosper I'm on the side of building a civilization towards the stars not
[13:31.440 --> 13:35.240]  constantly having a mindless war economy but that doesn't mean I like the
[13:35.240 --> 13:39.520]  peaceniks that go oh be peaceful teach your little boys how to wear dresses and
[13:39.520 --> 13:45.520]  to have basket weaving and no one can have a toy gun no I'm for individuals to
[13:45.520 --> 13:49.680]  be actually primitive and warlike because an actual primitive is more
[13:49.680 --> 13:54.200]  dialed in and smarter statistics show this can be taken to me you could take
[13:54.200 --> 13:57.120]  somebody out of the jungle folks and give them a top-level training and they
[13:57.120 --> 14:00.360]  end up being incredible people and the globalists had recognized this by the
[14:00.360 --> 14:06.400]  1850s the eugenicist Francis Galton wrote about it the father of eugenics that
[14:06.400 --> 14:12.000]  that that that the elite need to be like like like wild men but with a facade of
[14:12.000 --> 14:18.480]  grace and gentile effect and I'm telling you to counter them we need to be
[14:18.480 --> 14:25.960]  barbaric in our in our heart with love and strong against the usurpers
[14:25.960 --> 14:29.560]  because we're being usurped at every level by social engineers playing games
[14:29.560 --> 14:35.000]  with us and getting us to stand down and I'll have a survival instinct see I
[14:35.000 --> 14:38.440]  said I would read all the headlines and I went and I ran sort of ranning about
[14:38.440 --> 14:44.120]  that CJ this is a direct order because I don't have a producer producer wise you
[14:44.120 --> 14:47.640]  guys book guests make recommendations to a great job but most talk show hosts
[14:47.640 --> 14:50.840]  would have a consultant there just to keep them in line even if the talk show
[14:50.840 --> 14:54.400]  host was more than the consultant it's good to have somebody take them back you
[14:54.400 --> 14:59.120]  know the basic goals to cover news so I want you to stop me with the mic on just
[14:59.120 --> 15:04.160]  put turn on wherever I start going off the reservation right now you were to
[15:04.160 --> 15:09.520]  say no or hit a buzzer need to put up because we're gonna do it let me stop

[15:31.720 --> 15:37.400]  propaganda the head of their military said we got sleeper cells in America
[15:37.400 --> 15:43.320]  it's really asking for it really asking for it I mean and people like what
[15:43.320 --> 15:50.080]  you're suddenly pro-war no you don't threaten to attack my country and again
[15:50.080 --> 15:52.920]  they want to keep the fight going now that Obama's done this piece tell of

[17:26.960 --> 17:30.880]  things but it's not putting off a lot of radiant heat on average and that's a
[17:30.880 --> 17:35.280]  cycle and the sun does affect the weather I know that's a conspiracy theory
[17:35.280 --> 17:39.040]  for some but I'm sure you would be absolute zero without it winter storm

[19:08.640 --> 19:11.800]  Sun they said no it's not they said no that's why the ice caps are melting on
[19:11.800 --> 19:15.680]  Mars then of course they're growing again because the Sun's cooled off but

[26:16.920 --> 26:21.800]  has been proven to cause depression and not getting outside cabin fever whatever
[26:21.800 --> 26:24.800]  you want to call there's a lot of different things associated with it
[26:24.800 --> 26:28.360]  that's why it's important folks to go out anytime it's sunny during the winter
[26:28.360 --> 26:31.680]  and just walk around without sunglasses for about an hour and you'll just get
[26:31.680 --> 26:35.080]  totally excited I was a little bummed out yesterday I went to a tanning bed
[26:35.080 --> 26:37.960]  something I don't do except in the deep of winter it's artificial it's not
[26:37.960 --> 26:42.720]  probably good as the Sun but I just felt fabulous about eight o'clock at night
[26:42.720 --> 26:46.560]  last night when I went and did that was like a just total recharge so there's
[26:46.560 --> 26:51.400]  that news right there and again the reason I'm covering this right now is if
[26:51.400 --> 26:55.920]  you watch these videos that are up on info wars.com and are linked right there
[26:55.920 --> 27:00.600]  as I guess the eight story down one two three four five six seven eight no nine
[27:00.600 --> 27:06.040]  stories down at drudgereport drudgereport.com panic shoppers fight over
[27:06.040 --> 27:12.600]  food and it just shows that I mean I'm not plugging our sponsor I guess I might
[27:12.600 --> 27:16.280]  as well just say this hour brought to you by my my patreon supply.com forward
[27:16.280 --> 27:20.880]  slash Alex that's the reason I have storable food that's the reason it
[27:20.880 --> 27:25.160]  really stores like 25 years after it's about five years old I just go give it
[27:25.160 --> 27:30.520]  to the local food bank it's high quality and then just buy more that's what I
[27:30.520 --> 27:35.040]  do and it totally lasts for ten years they've proven in the last 25 but
[27:35.040 --> 27:39.000]  whatever it's like this race for how long can last the point is is it's the
[27:39.000 --> 27:42.640]  best storeable food out there my patreon supply.com forward slash Alex or
[27:42.640 --> 27:45.880]  eight six six two two nine zero nine two seven and I didn't even intend to plug
[27:45.880 --> 27:49.720]  that right now it's done later but this is why we have storeable food this is
[27:49.720 --> 27:54.120]  why we have guns this is why I know how to change the tire and compared to my
[27:54.120 --> 27:58.640]  dad who knows how to fix cars knows how to roof the roof or fix anything
[27:58.640 --> 28:03.240]  basically he doesn't know as much as his dad knew because back then you were the
[28:03.240 --> 28:07.480]  auto shop you were the roofing company you were the plumber I mean I am like a
[28:07.480 --> 28:13.280]  gibbering idiot compared to somebody like my dad or his dad who could skin a
[28:13.280 --> 28:18.200]  buck I mean I could skin a buck I could run a trot line I mean I make her own
[28:18.200 --> 28:22.800]  whiskey her own smoke too there ain't many things these old boys can do that
[28:22.800 --> 28:27.840]  they want you domesticated ladies and gentlemen they want you to be hyphenated
[28:27.840 --> 28:35.120]  balkanized Americans that literally don't know how to change the tire don't
[28:35.120 --> 28:40.040]  know how to do anything and it is getting worse and worse and worse by the
[28:40.040 --> 28:43.120]  minute and people don't know how to do basic math now because of calculators
[28:43.120 --> 28:47.280]  myself included I mean I'm like a minimal moron now at math I try to do it
[28:47.280 --> 28:51.640]  shorthand on a piece of paper but don't have an iPhone with me I mean this is
[28:51.640 --> 28:54.960]  part of the dumbing down of the of the technocracy there's a lot of things in
[28:54.960 --> 28:58.480]  the technological development that empower humans but overall it's a
[28:58.480 --> 29:02.040]  negative thing no one can debate that all the aggregates are there all the
[29:02.040 --> 29:06.480]  actuaries all the numbers and if we have a real depression again 90% of this
[29:06.480 --> 29:11.400]  country look it up in the 10-year depression from 29 to 40 11 year I
[29:11.400 --> 29:17.080]  guess still went into 41 or so the point is 11 12-year depression seven
[29:17.080 --> 29:22.720]  million people starved to death or died from malnutrition from other colds and
[29:22.720 --> 29:27.000]  things major university studies you can look it up with 90% being rural about
[29:27.000 --> 29:32.920]  50% being fully self-sufficient we're now 90% urban 10% rural half the rural
[29:32.920 --> 29:37.520]  communities are somewhat self-sufficient that's 5% versus 50 being fully
[29:37.520 --> 29:41.480]  self-sufficient I mean you're talking about a road scenario with Vigo
[29:41.480 --> 29:45.800]  Mortensen if this unfolds ladies and gentlemen if we have a collapse it will

[33:40.720 --> 33:46.600]  to spread to another area that's right deep space here we come
[33:46.600 --> 33:54.040]  watch the mayfly another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern
[33:54.040 --> 34:04.200]  you know what it is a virus a virus human beings are disease a cancer this is
[34:04.200 --> 34:11.920]  what the globalist think of us plague so they're turning us into a disease
[34:11.920 --> 34:23.200]  resistance to tyrants is obedience to God it's Alex Jones
[34:27.400 --> 34:34.520]  here's a another story that's in the top news archive of info wars com just the
[34:34.520 --> 34:37.840]  top story archive will take you to the stuff that's rolled off the front page
[34:37.840 --> 34:42.040]  and the new design of the site it's all ready but I want to really get it right
[34:42.040 --> 34:45.720]  we have a way to keep the best stuff up at the top but you can still go to the
[34:45.720 --> 34:52.400]  most popular area of info wars com and find the article about more bullets
[34:52.400 --> 34:57.320]  being bought by Homeland Security this time they're buying zombie killer which
[34:57.320 --> 35:04.120]  is a really high quality boat tailed long-distance sniper round that just so
[35:04.120 --> 35:09.040]  happens to be hollow partially hollow inside and is illegal under the Geneva
[35:09.040 --> 35:13.960]  Convention even use in warfare reason I keep plugging drudge is he keeps our
[35:13.960 --> 35:17.440]  stuff up it's important on the front page you go to drug report calm to the
[35:17.440 --> 35:22.400]  middle column and if we show that at drug report calm I like how he mixes it
[35:22.400 --> 35:26.040]  together with the other stuff to give you a an image of what's happening right
[35:26.040 --> 35:31.080]  under the monster Pelosi who looks like she's done one Botox shot too far
[35:31.080 --> 35:36.640]  Pelosi pack runs ad slamming Obamacare well that mean they're running away from
[35:36.640 --> 35:44.880]  their great victory homeland purchasing 141,000 more rounds of sniper ammo that
[35:44.880 --> 35:47.640]  by the way is illegal under the Geneva Convention what Watson should probably
[35:47.640 --> 35:51.200]  add that and then under it outfitting city buses with spy cameras and then
[35:51.200 --> 35:56.040]  here's the key tying it together National Guard trains to fight second
[35:56.040 --> 36:01.160]  amendment supporters by the way nationwide and I know I keep harping on
[36:01.160 --> 36:04.760]  that day after day but that we used to get the secret documents and people
[36:04.760 --> 36:08.760]  wouldn't believe it about this now it's like all over the news yes the main
[36:08.760 --> 36:14.080]  enemy is the gun owners and the veterans and don't talk about the founders
[36:14.080 --> 36:17.200]  they wouldn't be welcome in the day's army I mean this is West Point folks
[36:17.200 --> 36:22.400]  this is all AP Reuters Fox News going should we ban the Declaration of
[36:22.400 --> 36:28.600]  Independence Boston Globe is it hateful all men are created equal and doubt by
[36:28.600 --> 36:33.400]  their creator I mean we have a right to revolt against oppression is that
[36:33.400 --> 36:39.200]  actually legal to say you have a right to revolt against a tyranny two years
[36:39.200 --> 36:44.080]  ago they had an article they had a bunch of them saying should we get rid of the
[36:44.080 --> 36:50.480]  Declaration of Independence is it treason I think was the headline when
[36:50.480 --> 36:54.880]  freedom fails the best men rot in filthy jails and those that cried appease
[36:54.880 --> 36:59.920]  appease are hung by those they tried to please
[36:59.920 --> 37:05.360]  it'd be like if the ocean was alive the HD O2O was alive and had a voice it was
[37:05.360 --> 37:09.080]  there talking to the captain of a submarine and just said open the doors
[37:09.080 --> 37:14.120]  open the torpedo launch tips let the water come in depressurize you're gonna
[37:14.120 --> 37:19.440]  not be racist against water anymore just open the bulkhead just let the state

[38:00.720 --> 38:07.640]  heads cut off that the military is training for war with people that like
[38:07.640 --> 38:10.760]  the Bill of Rights and Constitution Declaration of Independence and private
[38:10.760 --> 38:15.680]  property the family the right to self-defense and they're a bunch of
[38:15.680 --> 38:21.240]  thugs the mayor of New York secretly you know caught 50 plus mayors of quits
[38:21.240 --> 38:24.000]  saying once we register we will confiscate we already knew that one of
[38:24.000 --> 38:28.280]  his own group members Mike Martinez here in Austin mayor pro team admitted
[38:28.280 --> 38:32.000]  that last year to us on video he said we're not gonna get confiscated now but
[38:32.000 --> 38:36.080]  after we register we will so get ready and this whole gang of them all looked
[38:36.080 --> 38:39.720]  at each other because they're on the winning team they think you got the
[38:39.720 --> 38:45.960]  governor in New York Homo all his bodyguards say hey you got guns your

[39:25.240 --> 39:28.920]  know they're obsessing on it because me thinks they protest too much the whole
[39:28.920 --> 39:35.320]  issue here ladies and gentlemen though is that it's a political agenda attaching
[39:35.320 --> 39:39.480]  all the socialism all the communism all the collectivism all the eugenics all
[39:39.480 --> 39:44.760]  the anti-family turn on the news turn on a sitcom men are degraded heterosexual

[40:11.720 --> 40:19.600]  aggressive cult move and can you imagine what John Wayne would think a guy who
[40:19.600 --> 40:23.280]  literally went over to the Communist Party headquarters in LA one time and

[41:10.920 --> 41:19.320]  compassion this is not about being tolerant it is about adoption and wide
[41:19.320 --> 41:23.920]  we cover this in in-game 2.0 with dr. Kaufman I gotta go watch that again and
[41:23.920 --> 41:29.080]  pull up the university documents I forget which ones it was a couple of them it was
[41:29.080 --> 41:34.240]  in the psychology departments and sociology departments and they said
[41:34.240 --> 41:37.640]  no we're gonna promote homosexuality we're gonna degrade the image of a man
[41:37.640 --> 41:42.200]  to reduce population and to break up families so the state is the only
[41:42.200 --> 41:48.000]  unifying system this is the end Germany is banning single family homes being
[41:48.000 --> 41:53.640]  built now as of this year by 2020 they're going to start bulldozing them many
[41:53.640 --> 42:01.360]  of them it's on you will live in a system controlled by them I mean this is

[43:10.160 --> 43:18.120]  brain and they were shoving her in my face 24-7 and just telling me I had to
[43:18.120 --> 43:21.360]  adopt what she said and what she wanted and what she was doing I would say

[43:42.640 --> 43:47.440]  the demonization in literature and on TV and in all the trendy shops where it
[43:47.440 --> 43:50.920]  shows you know a woman making dinner and it says oh you know I always wanted to
[43:50.920 --> 43:54.000]  be somebody I just should have you know what actually be something that mattered
[43:54.000 --> 43:58.000]  as if a woman staying home with her children and running the finances in the
[43:58.000 --> 44:01.000]  house in the full-time job and it's the most important thing ever for the
[44:01.000 --> 44:05.440]  civilization to go forward now the state rules the kids raises them look what's
[44:05.440 --> 44:10.480]  happened none of this was done putting women in the workforce to empower women
[44:10.480 --> 44:16.120]  it was done to get a hundred percent paying taxes it was done on record
[44:16.120 --> 44:19.720]  Edward Bernays wrote three books bragging about it they engineered the whole
[44:19.720 --> 44:22.560]  program worldwide

[44:36.240 --> 44:39.800]  and the women are all empowered running the house and the money and the whole
[44:39.800 --> 44:44.880]  nine yards and they're having five six seven kids but they tell you you don't
[44:44.880 --> 44:50.040]  do that you understand that women you get ahead by hating your husband you get
[44:50.040 --> 44:54.000]  ahead by using your husband and then your kids are destroyed and the men are a
[44:54.000 --> 44:58.720]  bunch of slobs to the men see the role models of acting like schlubs on TV and
[44:58.720 --> 45:03.240]  they buy into that as well it's scientific it's not my opinion become
[45:03.240 --> 45:09.440]  aware of it and then meanwhile I'm gonna get to the stock market stuff with

[48:02.360 --> 48:08.320]  taking over we've got to break through the wall of fake national security that's
[48:08.320 --> 48:12.120]  the elite security for a breakaway civilization we've got to capture the
[48:12.120 --> 48:15.960]  future we need the life extension technology that they're already hoarding
[48:15.960 --> 48:21.240]  we need Elysium for ourselves their answer to give you Elysium is open the
[48:21.240 --> 48:26.080]  borders no the answer is to give the technology to everybody and to break
[48:26.080 --> 48:29.800]  these monopolies the elite will never get off this planet if they don't do that
[48:29.800 --> 48:34.600]  you could just prime project on every angle you're not gonna do the wrong thing
[48:34.600 --> 48:38.640]  and get the future you're gonna really screw stuff up all right I'm gonna stop

[48:50.640 --> 48:54.360]  what's up Alex I want to throw a couple things out here I've been noticing in
[48:54.360 --> 48:59.960]  the last month I'm in Orange County California I saw I went fishing this last
[48:59.960 --> 49:04.760]  weekend down in San Diego fishing at the lake and I saw a drone launch from the
[49:04.760 --> 49:08.640]  back of a military chopper and I was kind of interesting I recorded on my
[49:08.640 --> 49:13.120]  iPad and kind of sketch me out a little bit so I had to leave the lake real
[49:13.120 --> 49:19.440]  quick I got home and then I saw another one launch there and Lemon Grove down
[49:19.440 --> 49:23.760]  in San Diego so I know that they're doing some they're doing some big down in
[49:23.760 --> 49:28.160]  San Diego I think something's gonna happen here real quick well Google's
[49:28.160 --> 49:33.080]  moving into all these DARPA and NASA bases building all sorts of secret
[49:33.080 --> 49:37.040]  stuff and giant warehouses I mean it's just crazy land man it's total
[49:37.040 --> 49:41.680]  can you imagine the technology we're seeing and it's 35 40 years advanced on
[49:41.680 --> 49:45.400]  average can you imagine no water they're so arrogant no wonder they don't care I
[49:45.400 --> 49:49.880]  mean it's just it's it's amazing they have stolen everything using our
[49:49.880 --> 49:53.360]  ingenuity to build a breakaway civilization you get what I'm saying
[49:53.360 --> 49:57.200]  brother yeah we're we're way behind they're still far ahead of us we're
[49:57.200 --> 50:01.080]  we're we're everybody's on beat out everybody's brains are turned off well
[50:01.080 --> 50:04.320]  they're getting ready for extermination I mean you gotta say they aren't being
[50:04.320 --> 50:12.160]  somewhat at least in the West somewhat loving about it they're giving us you
[50:12.160 --> 50:15.880]  know it's a soft kill they're basically killing our brains before they finally

[57:08.280 --> 57:13.120]  movie has grossed over a hundred million dollars and they're releasing a sequel

[58:12.080 --> 58:15.160]  of America no no but that's how they demonize they do this and all these
[58:15.160 --> 58:18.760]  movies where where the tyranny government's taken over they don't really
[58:18.760 --> 58:22.440]  say that movie til the end and and then it's founding fathers to demonize the

[01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:56.000]  in Washington thank you for holding as another first-time caller welcome hi
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:03.120]  Alex I'm calling today because I wanted to talk about my daughter and she was
[01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:08.080]  damaged by the MMR vaccine when she got her booster oh yeah that's one of the
[01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:13.320]  really bad ones yeah it is and you know the doctors have been denying that this
[01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:18.840]  has happened well of course they're accomplices sure well so start you know
[01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:23.920]  she got her shot and within a couple hours she started walking like she was
[01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:29.880]  drunk um this continue that's standard that's a neurological autoimmune response
[01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:33.680]  in the brain like a similar to Guillain beret this is that what they told you
[01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:39.160]  they're not that no well they've said that this is a mysterious illness and so
[01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:45.600]  it went from her walking once she was drunk to having double vision to being
[01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:50.360]  unresponsive small seizures and she ended up in the hospital with massive
[01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:54.120]  brain swelling and yeah see there there you go I mean I've never seen so many
[01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:58.360]  medical doctors that's why I know that look the vaccine inserts say it can do
[01:01:58.360 --> 01:02:02.320]  that to you but but listen you're listen here's the problem you're lucky they
[01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:05.640]  didn't say you beat her up with the brain breeding because that when it's
[01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:09.960]  when it's much worse for boys because they're not as strong blood-brain barrier
[01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:13.360]  as women women are much tougher than men when it comes to trauma you name it
[01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:15.680]  because they have to go through childbirth that's a genetic fact in all mammals
[01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:20.640]  it's on record right from whales to homo sapiens sapien and and I'm just so sad
[01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:25.200]  to hear this but yeah no but imagine the little boys it's many times worse and
[01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:29.640]  then they give them the 18 month all the third round in the year blessed if they
[01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:33.240]  have the convulsion and then become autistic from brain damage right there
[01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:36.800]  in the hospital because then they look at the surveillance camera and can't say
[01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:40.800]  you beat them up because they like the double juicy bonus of putting you in
[01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:44.560]  prison and institutionalizing the child they've just brain damage but I'm sorry
[01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:46.680]  go back to what happened to your daughter
[01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:57.440]  so um you know so now she is um she is legally mentally disabled she is in the sixth grade and she does second grade level work
[01:02:57.440 --> 01:03:04.200]  how old was she when they hit her with the chem web? this actually happened I I got
[01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:08.680]  them done wait for this last phase happened between the first and the second grade
[01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:13.120]  yeah and so she was doing great at the first the second grade and then they
[01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:16.080]  lied to you and said it was the law you got to have the shots for school which is
[01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:20.280]  not true it's part of a criminal conspiracy a eugenics operation and and
[01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:23.400]  and then and then you gave her the shot and this happened
[01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:26.880]  yes and you know the reason I'm calling is because
[01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:30.320]  talk right on your telephone I think somebody else is on your phone line
[01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:36.920]  listening somebody else at your house go ahead so there's two reasons why I'm
[01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:42.200]  calling to tell this story the first is that this could not have happened to my
[01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:48.320]  daughter if I was a so-called anti-vaccination conspiracy nut the
[01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:52.940]  second reason I am calling is because I made a huge mistake by never
[01:03:52.940 --> 01:03:58.720]  questioning the doctors in the system um this is my only way to honor her now is
[01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:03.840]  by telling people what had happened to her and well ma'am I'm obnoxious I'm
[01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:06.520]  gonna put you on hold I'm gonna come back to the floor for four minutes to
[01:04:06.520 --> 01:04:11.160]  start the whole story over and tell it as a testament because I get so upset
[01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:14.360]  when you start talking as I know what you're gonna say and I I've seen it
[01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:18.120]  thousands of times I'll see an autistic kid and I'll say let me guess 18 months
[01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:22.240]  third round MMR I mean it's like clockwork it's all on purpose there's
[01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:25.160]  all these government documents they admit it and they're just literally
[01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:29.760]  trying to kill our children's brains and I just love my daughter so much in my
[01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:34.160]  son and I have empathy I feel your daughter as if it was my daughter and
[01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:38.280]  it makes me very violent feeling I'm gonna be quite honest with you and I
[01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:42.200]  just hope the doctors are all real proud of themselves and the cancer the brain
[01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:47.560]  damage the autism up 30,000% now stay there ma'am I'm gonna come back to you
[01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:51.760]  start the whole story over give a testament from Kim and then we'll talk
[01:04:51.760 --> 01:05:00.520]  to Jonathan and we'll talk to Reese Joseph the Luth and others Alex Jones

[01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:23.240]  have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet but we can help to
[01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:27.240]  get it out of our bodies I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive

[01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:58.080]  cleansing our bodies now and support the info war at the same time that's info
[01:07:58.080 --> 01:08:28.040]  wars life.com there is a war it's happening now
[01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:33.920]  it will decide the fate of humanity the time to choose sides has come we are the
[01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:42.520]  resistance we are the info war that's right and the enemy's operations are so
[01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:47.200]  over-the-top the eugenicist by the 40s said we're having trouble forcibly
[01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:51.120]  sterilizing people worldwide and dumbing them down and the answer was from the
[01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:55.160]  Soviet gulags this is a Pulitzer prize winning two Pulitzer prize winning books
[01:08:55.160 --> 01:08:59.600]  on the Nuremberg trials because the Nazis and adopted hydrofluorosalic acid
[01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:04.920]  at about three parts per million they do 1.6 per million here to massively
[01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:13.400]  reduce IQ points at least 20% 1.6 does it between 7 IQ and 14 IQ depending on
[01:09:13.400 --> 01:09:17.120]  the study you look at I'm giving you Harvard studies I'm giving you Chinese
[01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:20.720]  government studies Japanese government studies Canadian studies University of
[01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:23.920]  Texas studies you don't believe me just typing University of Texas study on
[01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:27.720]  fluoride IQ I mean just just gonna take the challenge find out why I'm so freaked
[01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:35.680]  out and I've always been a sane person but it is insane what the globalists are
[01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:46.120]  doing and to sit there and watch them carry it out and to know that you keep
[01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:50.760]  hearing about secret sterilizations in Texas and California they're totally
[01:09:50.760 --> 01:09:54.000]  illegal where they grab foster kids you name it sterilize them prisoners and
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:58.120]  sterilize them and they'll even do surgery test on them and test docs and
[01:09:58.120 --> 01:10:00.400]  on them you know it comes in it's like well nobody's gonna get in trouble and
[01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:05.600]  it's all been sealed and oh we did take your blood from birth since 1972 and put
[01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:08.520]  it in a global database and companies say they own your blood now blah blah
[01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:11.880]  blah your DNA and then a lady called in the last segment we just joined us
[01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:16.760]  Kim in Washington and I was illustrating let me guess you took the
[01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:22.680]  shot and then had blood on the brain and convulsions and then lost a bunch of
[01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:29.640]  IQ see it's designed to only skim off 10 20 points but sometimes you have a
[01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:35.040]  catastrophic event especially in males because the blood brain barrier and
[01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:40.160]  other issues according to medical doctors and I'm here talking about it's
[01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:43.280]  only Joe Stalin lining folks up and shoot number Hitler they're just have
[01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:47.200]  doctors who believe in what they're doing the nurses their brain damaging
[01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:50.640]  people they pretty much know what's going on now but they can't admit the
[01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:55.400]  whole thing was wrong going back eight years ago now the American Dental
[01:10:55.400 --> 01:11:01.360]  Association via lawsuits and their own toxicologist going public they had
[01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:04.440]  toxicologist in Canada who's also a dentist has gone public who promoted
[01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:09.200]  fluoridation and he's now apologized that was two years ago that was all
[01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:16.080]  over the Canadian papers about how deadly it is and how he believed the lies the
[01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:21.680]  point is is that for seven eight years about eight years ago now you can look
[01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:25.320]  this up that they said stop giving children under six fluoride toothpaste or
[01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:30.320]  fluoride water but then you notice they rolled out fluoride for kids in all the
[01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:34.600]  major bottled water started fortifying juice drinks with it stuff calling it
[01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:38.960]  minerals added for flavor and they put the most deadly type you need calcium
[01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:43.440]  fluoride or you will die very small amounts of it you need arsenic very
[01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:46.760]  low amounts of you you know you will die you need lead very low amounts or you
[01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:52.240]  will die it's all part of the chain reaction range structure cell transfers
[01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:55.400]  according to scientists we've interviewed it's well-known science but
[01:11:55.400 --> 01:11:59.200]  they're giving it to you at hundreds of thousands of times what you need and
[01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:07.400]  they're giving you the electro electrified hydrofluorosilic acid so
[01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:12.000]  they're taking it and turbocharging it so that it then acts as an adjuvant to
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:16.600]  the other drugs added to the food and water to then elevate the level of the
[01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:21.360]  drugging and that's why people look so unhealthy and society screwed up I mean
[01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:24.560]  you're in the matrix folks you're being hit with chemical biological attack
[01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:27.880]  that's why when some Aryan cop or somebody yells at me filming in public
[01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:30.480]  I sort of laughing under man you're a slave they're gonna take your pension
[01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:34.040]  fund you know this isn't freedom why are you following these orders how much of
[01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:37.240]  your family's down to cancer right now I did this in England and the US repeatedly
[01:12:37.240 --> 01:12:42.040]  on tape and they just go what do you know about that I'm like well I saw in
[01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:45.680]  the local British paper that half the Brits by 2010 are gonna have cancer he
[01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:49.080]  goes I know what's why is it going up why's everybody got it I'm like it's a
[01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:53.440]  chemical biological warfare program here are some books you can read written by
[01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:57.360]  the enemy you understand you're not part of the winning team and they go I
[01:12:57.360 --> 01:13:02.040]  already know that I'm just following my orders well I'm like okay just whatever
[01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:06.080]  man I told you what's going on and I'm not a hero I'm nothing special they're
[01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:09.800]  killing us of course I'm warning you it's not special that I'm telling you
[01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:18.720]  this it's crazy they put plastic in most of the fast food bread that gives you
[01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:29.120]  kidney failure and liver failure I'm not good and I think about this woman who
[01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:33.800]  called in and her little sweet first grade daughter who they lied to and said
[01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:37.280]  take the MMR shot just joined us she was telling the story I wanted to recap the
[01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:42.720]  whole thing about me interrupting and they gave her the MMR shot and then she
[01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:46.440]  couldn't walk first she was stumbling they couldn't walk then had seizures
[01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:49.280]  blood on the brain they admitted it all so we don't know what the mystery
[01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:56.320]  illnesses fucks they designed Gardasil to eat your ovaries we told you that eight
[01:13:56.320 --> 01:13:59.960]  years ago with scientists and doctors and they had Rick Perry lie and say it's
[01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:03.760]  the law to take it and a majority of Texas girls lined up and took it and
[01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:12.720]  folks they are Rex now and they got away with it they got away with it and I've
[01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:16.600]  had Rick Perry staff not once but twice now people I see on TV but off record
[01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:22.520]  and people are really come to me and apologize and go what do we do one of
[01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:27.560]  them was in the military at Fort Sam Houston and saw special forces brought
[01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:31.480]  in it was six years before end game he came to the end game premier so that
[01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:38.480]  was 14 years ago right when Perry was already governor about to be governor and
[01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:43.240]  he came in this is before he worked for Perry and they all gave him an
[01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:46.720]  oculation so that he said it was eight of them and they all died two days later
[01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:49.360]  and they strapped them all down they said we're giving them an oculation
[01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:52.880]  went oh they don't give you all the info they go oh they're sick they're
[01:14:52.880 --> 01:14:57.040]  convulsing probably some of a rabies or something weaponized rabies they strapped
[01:14:57.040 --> 01:15:01.720]  them all down as these special forces guys were murdered then they sent guys
[01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:05.600]  in and hazmat suits to spray bleach all over the walls and take them out but
[01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:09.720]  before they did that they sucked all the blood out of the troops and you know
[01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:13.760]  what they were gonna do they're using their blood as growth medium then
[01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:22.400]  literally took the troops and suck their blood out for growth medium you want to
[01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:27.040]  compromise with these people you think they just use fetal cells to grow
[01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:33.760]  vaccines they use the troops blood and organs you're nothing to them and the
[01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:37.200]  sooner you figure that out the sooner we're gonna turn this around
[01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:42.440]  he goes what do I do he goes Rick Perry's really good you know he believed in all
[01:15:42.440 --> 01:15:50.760]  that he didn't know but I know a lot of this is true because I saw it you
[01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:59.320]  saw it didn't you what you know give him shots watch him die it's loving it's
[01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:05.160]  loving so take all the shots okay the government wants to help you let's talk
[01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:09.240]  to Kim Kim you've got four minutes tell your story of what happened to your
[01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:14.400]  daughter where you're at and how it all unfolded go ahead I'm starting from
[01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:18.480]  starting from the beginning or where we're at now no no because some stations
[01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:23.920]  just joined to start over look at your daughter what happened okay my daughter
[01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:31.680]  was vaccinated by the MMR vaccine on the booster within a couple hours she
[01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:38.840]  started walking like she was drunk she could not walk a straight line and this
[01:16:38.840 --> 01:16:44.840]  continued for a few weeks and you know honestly I was so young I I didn't
[01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:51.000]  really connect it to the shot unfortunately and it was that it was
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:58.240]  looking back now that I've seen you know it started within a couple hours and
[01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:04.600]  she just continued on for weeks she'd be walking and then just fall over on the
[01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:09.160]  ground and let me guess the hospital didn't even tell you to give her benadryl
[01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:11.800]  or anything to reduce swelling or anything they just said we don't know
[01:17:11.800 --> 01:17:16.600]  what's happening yeah no like we're giving your daughter a gift go ahead I'm
[01:17:16.600 --> 01:17:21.880]  sorry and I took her back to the doctor and told him what was happening and you
[01:17:21.880 --> 01:17:26.640]  know they had no explanation they didn't they didn't even it was almost like they
[01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:31.520]  were just ignoring what I was saying and so she started complaining of double
[01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:36.560]  vision you know I'd be talking to her and she's like mommy I see a whole bunch
[01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:41.840]  of you and you know I took her back to the doctor for that and no putting her on
[01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:47.960]  ice no giving her benadryl no nothing when they knew full well what they just
[01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:51.320]  done but they couldn't diagnose it or they would admit they did it so they
[01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:56.600]  sat there and watched her loser IQ but tell us what happened next absolutely
[01:17:56.600 --> 01:18:03.400]  and so you know I started she'd go into these bells where she just there and I
[01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:09.040]  try and talk to her and she wouldn't even talk back to me and this continued for
[01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:15.920]  months about two months I I took her to the doctor I took her into the ER for
[01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:22.560]  the for the double vision they all ignored me honestly they ignored me
[01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:33.480]  after two months I I looked in at her and she was completely swamped over she
[01:18:33.480 --> 01:18:39.760]  couldn't move she couldn't even pick up her own head and but she was
[01:18:39.760 --> 01:18:45.520]  complaining of headache and so I took her into the hospital and they were
[01:18:45.520 --> 01:18:50.200]  trying to say she had meningitis and all of these crazy things that she did
[01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:56.820]  not have the test came back negative of course and she had massive brain
[01:18:56.820 --> 01:19:03.920]  swelling they had to put her on steroids get the brain slowing to stop we
[01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:11.000]  were in there for weeks and but it it's floated down didn't it yeah but see they
[01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:15.640]  could have given you that minutes after but they can't admit they just did it so
[01:19:15.640 --> 01:19:20.600]  they send you off and for liability I mean these people these doctors and
[01:19:20.600 --> 01:19:25.360]  nurses are murdering people's brains you know a lot of people die I mean just
[01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:29.800]  search woman dies at the flu shot boy does it flu shot boy dies after MMR shot
[01:19:29.800 --> 01:19:34.360]  it's happening all the time it is happening all the time and you know my
[01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:41.120]  my daughter was one of those people and her life has been changed forever this is
[01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:44.680]  too powerful we're skipping the break the money doesn't matter can skip the
[01:19:44.680 --> 01:19:52.800]  break continue ma'am go ahead no thank you before it happened she was a happy
[01:19:52.800 --> 01:20:01.960]  thriving little girl she had friends she had fun she she did excellent in school
[01:20:01.960 --> 01:20:06.680]  granted she didn't have a lot of schooling under her belt because she was
[01:20:06.680 --> 01:20:15.560]  young but she was doing wonderful she was such a sweet happy girl and it when
[01:20:15.560 --> 01:20:23.760]  this happened it felt like when I left that hospital my daughter died and I
[01:20:23.760 --> 01:20:29.400]  have someone else now now that's what they did they they gave your daughter
[01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:34.760]  partial lobotomy and they do that to little babies every day they do to
[01:20:34.760 --> 01:20:38.280]  little girls little boys they sterilize them with the garter cell and it's all
[01:20:38.280 --> 01:20:42.680]  on record but it's so horrible the public can't admit it and even when
[01:20:42.680 --> 01:20:46.440]  doctors get brain damage children themselves they won't admit it most of
[01:20:46.440 --> 01:20:50.280]  them but let me tell you most doctors I know a nurses they pressured me three
[01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:53.640]  times to give shots even though the doctor we have as a listener and a good
[01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:57.440]  lady and but it's such a cult from the hospital management and the nurses
[01:20:57.440 --> 01:21:01.360]  would always go we don't give our kids it either we we know it causes auto
[01:21:01.360 --> 01:21:05.600]  immune stuff but we get fired if we don't push it and we this is but because
[01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:10.720]  all the time that's gay lesbian black white you know blah blah blah Michelle
[01:21:10.720 --> 01:21:16.560]  Obama's arms while meanwhile they're doing this to everybody and it tears my
[01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:20.720]  guts out and and but also sends me into a rage because here's the deal they're
[01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:25.040]  now beginning for the first time ever in California and New York actual forced
[01:21:25.040 --> 01:21:28.720]  inoculations where they're not just lying and saying it's the law to show
[01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:32.400]  their criminality it's the law this August to get vaccinated there's 50
[01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:36.960]  vaccines by law you've got to get show up at Zilker Park in Austin to get your
[01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:42.440]  free shots parents prevent disease and and people will even collapse there or
[01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:45.640]  they'll go oh they just got scared by the shot my daughter's having a
[01:21:45.640 --> 01:21:50.680]  convulsion ten minutes after well that did we don't know what that is blood's
[01:21:50.680 --> 01:21:55.240]  coming out their nose out their ears you know that's a gift that's the gift of
[01:21:55.240 --> 01:22:00.520]  the New World Order it's the sacrament and I'm not trying to be sarcastic with
[01:22:00.520 --> 01:22:06.680]  you your pain really gets to me but but I'm being cynical with dark satire back
[01:22:06.680 --> 01:22:12.480]  at the people that they go along with this I mean I know medical doctors who
[01:22:12.480 --> 01:22:16.920]  literally I've run into and then I knew years ago let's just say connected to
[01:22:16.920 --> 01:22:22.800]  family who who literally hate my guts because I talk about this nigga well
[01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:27.640]  there are some problems but but but problem you know problems are outpaced
[01:22:27.640 --> 01:22:32.720]  by benefits cost-benefit analysis but that's not even true nigga well don't
[01:22:32.720 --> 01:22:36.640]  see believe in the science of inoculation and acquired immunity and I go
[01:22:36.640 --> 01:22:40.920]  yes I know it's 500 years old I know it started with Hawks I know how it was they
[01:22:40.920 --> 01:22:46.120]  took the Pustules with a toothpick and shove it under the skin I get all that
[01:22:46.120 --> 01:22:49.920]  give someone a lesser exposure so don't get the full exposure give it to them
[01:22:49.920 --> 01:22:52.680]  when they're immune systems up not down you'd usually get it when you had a
[01:22:52.680 --> 01:22:55.880]  bad immune system and it would kill you so give it to someone when they're doing
[01:22:55.880 --> 01:22:59.720]  well still though the pox treatment it could kill people sometimes it was a
[01:22:59.720 --> 01:23:05.160]  cost-benefit analysis but pox out of somebody's pussy arm put into your
[01:23:05.160 --> 01:23:09.120]  center daughter so that they don't get it when they're sick and then die is not
[01:23:09.120 --> 01:23:13.640]  genetically engineered super weapons by a global government known for doing a
[01:23:13.640 --> 01:23:17.360]  hundred years of secret testing and literally creating Nazi Germany as a
[01:23:17.360 --> 01:23:21.440]  testing ground and then destroying it who are involved in depopulation and
[01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:25.000]  openly saying babies are like mackerel I have articles here today where they're
[01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:29.240]  now coming out saying it's end-of-life planning to kill your your your unborn
[01:23:29.240 --> 01:23:33.920]  child or your baby I mean that's how there it is right there on screen this
[01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:39.320]  this is the type of stuff that we're talking about and when you're faced with
[01:23:39.320 --> 01:23:45.360]  something this evil this over the top by the authorities it's hard for the
[01:23:45.360 --> 01:23:49.240]  average person to come to grips with it I believe in the science of inoculation
[01:23:49.240 --> 01:23:55.000]  the elites get very special proprietary multi-thousand dose made in
[01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:59.800]  incredibly clean laboratories they get real vaccines and that's come out in
[01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:03.200]  the news the British elite the German elite the German government and the
[01:24:03.200 --> 01:24:05.720]  German military heard about it and said we're not taking it unless you give us
[01:24:05.720 --> 01:24:09.440]  that this is the issue then they lie to you and say oh we've cleaned up the
[01:24:09.440 --> 01:24:13.400]  vaccines no they haven't no they haven't that it's not cleaning them up it's done
[01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:19.080]  on purpose bear put HIV and hepatitis in the factor 8 and knew it and shipped
[01:24:19.080 --> 01:24:22.760]  it out to hundreds of thousands and killed them and that all came out in
[01:24:22.760 --> 01:24:28.200]  court folks that's on the news they wanted to kill people they knew and did
[01:24:28.200 --> 01:24:33.080]  it they want to kill you they will kill you if they can but they don't want you
[01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:36.480]  to know how you got killed they want to hit you in 20 years you down the road
[01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:40.040]  you drop with debilitating diseases they know what you're gonna get from what
[01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:44.920]  they've done to you they develop the treatments not the cures and then while
[01:24:44.920 --> 01:24:48.480]  testing all this stuff on you they're developing life extension technologies
[01:24:48.480 --> 01:24:54.040]  for themselves and I've given you the entire paradigm of the enemy your
[01:24:54.040 --> 01:25:01.040]  daughter is not dead her soul is there she can be taught to grow again I would
[01:25:01.040 --> 01:25:06.000]  limit the television screen time I would play her classical music I would pray
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:10.680]  for her I would take her to the top of clear clean mountains and she will she
[01:25:10.680 --> 01:25:16.720]  she can come back from it your daughter is not dead they wish she was but God
[01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:21.880]  bless you and I really appreciate your call thank you thank you so much thank
[01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:25.280]  you and sometimes I go off when I get a caller like that for 20 30 minutes because
[01:25:25.280 --> 01:25:29.280]  ladies and gentlemen this is so serious talk about dehumanization police shoot
[01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:33.480]  helper dog instead of a shoot labs you name it all time account with her tail
[01:25:33.480 --> 01:25:36.440]  wagging will shoot them some cases the dogs are growling and I get while
[01:25:36.440 --> 01:25:42.240]  somebody shoots a big scary dog but it's not a bull mastiff it's not a you know
[01:25:42.240 --> 01:25:47.280]  it's a pit bull or something it they shoot Chihuahuas and stuff as a default you
[01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:50.960]  should be a little bit more manly if you want to be a cop or womanly valkyrie like
[01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:54.920]  but here's your curry Jackson's report on this event that happened a few days ago
[01:25:54.920 --> 01:26:03.880]  from info wars nightly news police shoot a service dog here's the report
[01:26:03.880 --> 01:26:22.120]  we've all been annoyed by a barking dog or a dog on the loose and sometimes
[01:26:22.120 --> 01:26:26.040]  police are called in to handle these situations but is this the type of police
[01:26:26.040 --> 01:26:31.120]  response that you would want to happen in your own front yard and yes once again
[01:26:31.120 --> 01:26:35.120]  those dogs should have been under the direct supervision and control of their
[01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:39.280]  owner but with a modern officer carrying things such as pepper spray was
[01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:43.960]  lethal force really necessary let's stay on this topic of lethal force what if
[01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:48.120]  the gun was turned the other way and the officer was in the crosshairs that's
[01:26:48.120 --> 01:26:52.640]  exactly what happened right here in the state of Texas sheriffs looking for
[01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:57.280]  marijuana burst into a man's home and ran straight into gunfire by a startled
[01:26:57.280 --> 01:27:02.520]  resident killing an officer the resident was able to avoid a murder charge but it
[01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:06.840]  goes to show that over aggressive police tactics can backfire on officers
[01:27:06.840 --> 01:27:12.400]  over aggressive tactics such as kicking a woman out of her own home a woman was
[01:27:12.400 --> 01:27:16.960]  displaced from her home so a SWAT team could perform reconnaissance much like
[01:27:16.960 --> 01:27:21.600]  we saw during the Boston bombing but to give credit where it's due not all
[01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:25.440]  officers are out in the streets behaving badly such as in New York where they
[01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:29.000]  just busted up a New York crime syndicate with the joint agency
[01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:33.400]  cooperation so if we have more stories like this police going after real crimes
[01:27:33.400 --> 01:27:37.160]  and going out to the real perpetrators and not harassing the general populace
[01:27:37.160 --> 01:27:41.400]  we can break free of this current police state you can find more reports at
[01:27:41.400 --> 01:27:47.720]  info wars calm at a prison planet dot TV all right that's jacquard Jackson and
[01:27:47.720 --> 01:27:50.520]  that's just a minute and a half of the 30 minute news transmission every night

[01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:08.360]  later in the broadcast because it's so important it deals with a dumpster diving
[01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:12.240]  professor who's trying to teach us that we should live with nothing so that the
[01:28:12.240 --> 01:28:15.960]  globalists can have bigger red carpets bigger palaces and live like kings while
[01:28:15.960 --> 01:28:20.080]  telling us we can't have air conditioning or over a 250 square foot home so that
[01:28:20.080 --> 01:28:23.560]  more of what we make and be paid in taxes that's what the austerity is all
[01:28:23.560 --> 01:28:27.400]  about that's coming up after dr. Paul Craig Roberts leaves us we're gonna play
[01:28:27.400 --> 01:28:33.160]  that with Gerald Salente and talk about this artificial scarcity economy that is

[01:33:17.360 --> 01:33:31.600]  it's Alex Jones we are joined the next 25 minutes by dr. Paul Craig Roberts he's
[01:33:31.600 --> 01:33:37.920]  an American economist and he's of course a syndicated columnist as well he's a
[01:33:37.920 --> 01:33:45.200]  former editor the Wall Street Journal and business week and he is the father
[01:33:45.200 --> 01:33:49.360]  of Reaganomics and he's really needs no introduction our audience we have a lot
[01:33:49.360 --> 01:33:53.000]  of new stations a lot of listeners so I guess he does and we'll give you his
[01:33:53.000 --> 01:34:00.360]  website address as well on screen coming up here in just a moment we also carry
[01:34:00.360 --> 01:34:05.840]  his work at info wars dot com and prison planet dot com but before I go any
[01:34:05.840 --> 01:34:09.320]  further I just want to cover the waterfront with him to make sense of
[01:34:09.320 --> 01:34:13.680]  what's going on the economic meltdown clearly a global depression this market
[01:34:13.680 --> 01:34:20.880]  watch article scary 1929 market chart gains traction government is gearing up
[01:34:20.880 --> 01:34:24.520]  for a collapse I think we're going into a slow collapse but I want to get an
[01:34:24.520 --> 01:34:27.160]  update from him on that but first the reason I wanted to get him on last week
[01:34:27.160 --> 01:34:32.360]  and now he's here is to talk about Ukraine and again I'm not a Putinite but
[01:34:32.360 --> 01:34:38.160]  compared to what we've got our system so bad he's not aggressively trying to
[01:34:38.160 --> 01:34:42.120]  expand things he stopped the Syria war the purge of Christians clearly the
[01:34:42.120 --> 01:34:46.040]  Saudi Arabians are bombing them because they didn't go along with the takeover
[01:34:46.040 --> 01:34:54.200]  of Syria to destabilize the Olympics but you you see Ukraine not voting at
[01:34:54.200 --> 01:35:02.160]  first to go with the EU and now Russia is not even trying to control Ukraine
[01:35:02.160 --> 01:35:06.280]  from what I've seen I want to free independent Ukraine and George Soros's
[01:35:06.280 --> 01:35:11.280]  people are all over this as usual trying to destabilize Russia because they want
[01:35:11.280 --> 01:35:14.520]  a new world order run by the Wall Street kleptocrats they want a new world
[01:35:14.520 --> 01:35:18.760]  order run by anti-free market folks that make the Wolf of Wall Street Jordan
[01:35:18.760 --> 01:35:24.520]  Belford look like a saint and that's that's the bottom line this is not
[01:35:24.520 --> 01:35:28.800]  America doing this to Russia this is criminal elements doing it in my view I
[01:35:28.800 --> 01:35:33.040]  want Dr. Roberts take on that so there's the preface of my questions and how I
[01:35:33.040 --> 01:35:38.040]  see it this is a big deal though to be trying to overthrow Ukraine and audio
[01:35:38.040 --> 01:35:41.800]  recordings of this obviously with ambassadors coming out in a very serious
[01:35:41.800 --> 01:35:46.160]  situation Dr. Roberts give us your expert breakdowns I know you were in big
[01:35:46.160 --> 01:35:49.640]  talks with the Russians so they bring down their their empire at the end of
[01:35:49.640 --> 01:35:52.560]  the Reagan administration I know that you know a lot of these folks you know
[01:35:52.560 --> 01:35:56.960]  the French you've gotten their highest award for some of the work you've done
[01:35:56.960 --> 01:36:02.840]  on that front as well what's really happening right now and the Ukraine
[01:36:02.840 --> 01:36:12.400]  there was a joint effort initially between the EU and Washington to bring
[01:36:12.400 --> 01:36:21.320]  the EU I started to bring the Ukraine into NATO and into EU now the EU just
[01:36:21.320 --> 01:36:31.920]  wanted an expansion of its domain Washington wanted to have the Ukraine
[01:36:31.920 --> 01:36:36.360]  incorporated in the NATO so they can put more military bases on Russia's
[01:36:36.360 --> 01:36:42.960]  frontier and they also want to have their puppets running the country so that
[01:36:42.960 --> 01:36:48.320]  can be opened up for looting by the American banks in the American
[01:36:48.320 --> 01:36:57.120]  corporations you know like for example Latvia was so what has happened is for
[01:36:57.120 --> 01:37:03.200]  many years Washington and also the EU have been financing what are called
[01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:10.320]  NGOs non-governmental organizations in Ukraine last December this Victoria
[01:37:10.320 --> 01:37:15.000]  Newland the Assistant Secretary of State who's running the operation the
[01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:20.160]  American operation there told the National Press Club that Washington had
[01:37:20.160 --> 01:37:28.160]  invested five billion dollars in agitation in the Ukraine and so what
[01:37:28.160 --> 01:37:32.400]  we're witnessing now is all of these NGOs some of them pretend to be human
[01:37:32.400 --> 01:37:38.840]  rights organizations some pretend to be educational to teach democracy some are
[01:37:38.840 --> 01:37:47.520]  just provocative and they have used these that is the State Department CIA have
[01:37:47.520 --> 01:37:58.560]  used these institutions these NGOs to have this ongoing protest now the EU and
[01:37:58.560 --> 01:38:05.080]  Washington have now fallen out over this because the EU has realized that for
[01:38:05.080 --> 01:38:11.440]  Washington to take over the Ukraine is a direct threat to Russia and they
[01:38:11.440 --> 01:38:16.520]  realize that Russia can cut Europe off from oil and natural gas and they
[01:38:16.520 --> 01:38:20.720]  realize that if there's a war a Europe will be destroyed and that's why we
[01:38:20.720 --> 01:38:25.000]  don't need Ukraine to fall to the EU that's gonna suck it dry that's like
[01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:28.680]  asking to have cancer and plant it in you clearly predatory as you know their
[01:38:28.680 --> 01:38:32.440]  own EU documents have come out that it was a planned program to consolidate and
[01:38:32.440 --> 01:38:36.920]  suck countries dry so the Ukrainians vote to not join it and so they have
[01:38:36.920 --> 01:38:40.720]  hordes of paid operatives take the streets it'd be one thing of these were
[01:38:40.720 --> 01:38:45.000]  real you know Ukrainians wanting to get rid of their government but clearly
[01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:50.360]  these are foreign manipulated saboteur operatives by every by every benchmark
[01:38:50.360 --> 01:38:59.480]  well the NGOs are financed by the West and there they had provoked it but I
[01:38:59.480 --> 01:39:03.600]  think most of the people out there are just dudes and they're Ukrainians of
[01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:09.440]  course yeah the Western Ukraine is about the NGOs that are made up of Ukrainian
[01:39:09.440 --> 01:39:17.400]  operatives sorry I was talking about the NGOs themselves doctors yeah yeah well I
[01:39:17.400 --> 01:39:22.960]  was in Washington when they decided to create the National Endowment for
[01:39:22.960 --> 01:39:29.080]  Democracy which is sort of the parent organization for these NGOs and the
[01:39:29.080 --> 01:39:35.480]  explicit purpose given was that it would be used to destabilize Eastern Europe
[01:39:35.480 --> 01:39:44.240]  and and Soviet publics and would be used for the benefit of American hegemy and
[01:39:44.240 --> 01:39:49.880]  that's the reason it was created and so we've seen it operate in many places
[01:39:49.880 --> 01:39:55.480]  they tried to achieve that revolution that color revolution in the Ukraine
[01:39:55.480 --> 01:39:58.880]  what they call it the orange revolution I think yes they've tried over and over
[01:39:58.880 --> 01:40:04.480]  again they came very close to getting the Ukraine there and they tried to have
[01:40:04.480 --> 01:40:11.160]  Georgia start a war with Russia a very dangerous situation what do you expect
[01:40:11.160 --> 01:40:14.160]  Russia to do I mean they're they're starting to really get in more of a
[01:40:14.160 --> 01:40:24.040]  fighting stance well I don't know about what they would do I one prospect is the
[01:40:24.040 --> 01:40:30.360]  country will split apart because the the Eastern Ukraine they had it's more
[01:40:30.360 --> 01:40:37.120]  Russian it's Russian Orthodox the Western Ukraine is less Russian it's
[01:40:37.120 --> 01:40:44.680]  Catholic and I think that it's really two countries and what you may see is is a
[01:40:44.680 --> 01:40:52.600]  split what I find so distressing is that the Ukrainians in them I think these
[01:40:52.600 --> 01:41:00.680]  protests are largely in the West West apart now they are right yeah and and so
[01:41:00.680 --> 01:41:05.600]  what I find stressing is that these protesters are such dudes that they're
[01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:10.320]  destroying the independence of their own country they don't understand that if
[01:41:10.320 --> 01:41:16.200]  you are in the EU that your national government is subservient to the EU how
[01:41:16.200 --> 01:41:20.560]  can they not look at Greece and Spain and Ireland and everywhere I mean this is
[01:41:20.560 --> 01:41:24.080]  like wanting to get in the car with Jeffrey Dahmer or something why would
[01:41:24.080 --> 01:41:30.760]  anyone want to join the EU that's that just shows the influence of the NGOs
[01:41:30.760 --> 01:41:36.080]  you know the NGOs of like Victoria Newland said there's Washington said
[01:41:36.080 --> 01:41:41.120]  five billion dollars that's five thousand million dollars you can buy a lot
[01:41:41.120 --> 01:41:47.880]  of people for that money you can buy a lot and and the years of agitation by
[01:41:47.880 --> 01:41:54.840]  these NGOs and and also you know in the in the Western Ukraine there's a huge
[01:41:54.840 --> 01:42:00.560]  disaffection from Russia they there's this romantic form of Ukrainian
[01:42:00.560 --> 01:42:08.120]  nationalism and there's a real dislike of Russian so even though Ukraine is
[01:42:08.120 --> 01:42:16.000]  independent now they have this notion that well the country will somehow be
[01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:20.240]  under Russia's thumb unless we can get under the thumb of the Europeans and
[01:42:20.240 --> 01:42:26.200]  the Americans so it's it's kind of a nonsensical thing but it is very
[01:42:26.200 --> 01:42:33.000]  dangerous because I think that the Russians do view a NATO basis in the
[01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:37.680]  Ukraine or in Ukraine as it's called that's right on their border as as a
[01:42:37.680 --> 01:42:44.880]  direct threat and so they and this is why there's now a divergence between the
[01:42:44.880 --> 01:42:52.680]  EU and the United States and why the Victoria Newland said you know screw the
[01:42:52.680 --> 01:42:59.800]  EU. Now for those that don't know, tell me about that. Well the Europeans
[01:42:59.800 --> 01:43:05.320]  realized that this was going too far and they wanted to stop encouraging the
[01:43:05.320 --> 01:43:10.040]  protests because they understand they don't know it's a threat to Russia and
[01:43:10.040 --> 01:43:16.320]  then therefore it's an indirect threat to Europe and so they the Europeans EU said
[01:43:16.320 --> 01:43:20.320]  we've had enough let's stop these protests and Washington said no we're
[01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:26.520]  gonna keep them going we're gonna use the protests turn it into a revolt take
[01:43:26.520 --> 01:43:30.440]  over the government see we've got a list of the candidates we're gonna put in
[01:43:30.440 --> 01:43:35.800]  charge and the EU was protesting and by the way that's what the Russians used to
[01:43:35.800 --> 01:43:39.560]  do was get a quasi-puppet government in that would then invite them into these
[01:43:39.560 --> 01:43:44.200]  countries we are doing what the USSR used to do I mean this is we're doing
[01:43:44.200 --> 01:43:50.480]  the bad guy deeds correct but we always have especially in in central and
[01:43:50.480 --> 01:43:56.600]  South America there's never been any difference really between the United
[01:43:56.600 --> 01:44:01.640]  States and the Soviet Union and how they manipulate other countries but what
[01:44:01.640 --> 01:44:06.120]  we're doing now is we're manipulating the countries in the Russian sphere of
[01:44:06.120 --> 01:44:12.600]  influence we've gone beyond our own spirit the whole world now is our sphere
[01:44:12.600 --> 01:44:17.720]  influence and no other country has and what do you make what's the strategy I
[01:44:17.720 --> 01:44:22.080]  mean I want your take on this to have the athletes dressing like women I mean
[01:44:22.080 --> 01:44:25.880]  you know everybody loved us because of James Dean and John Wayne and I mean
[01:44:25.880 --> 01:44:28.880]  guys look dressed like women that's great but should our national symbol be a
[01:44:28.880 --> 01:44:32.440]  man in drag I mean it should that be our symbol at the at the Olympics I don't
[01:44:32.440 --> 01:44:37.040]  think that propaganda is very well thought out no it's not but we don't
[01:44:37.040 --> 01:44:42.040]  need to get into that right now we've got the Ukraine and the economy which are
[01:44:42.040 --> 01:44:46.520]  important no absolutely I'm just saying a lot like British you know deputy
[01:44:46.520 --> 01:44:50.720]  defense minister said two weeks ago the United States doesn't even seem to have
[01:44:50.720 --> 01:44:55.760]  a strategy now except chaos and we're losing all the soft power what do you
[01:44:55.760 --> 01:44:59.640]  think of Washington right now I mean how would you describe it it's it's it's
[01:44:59.640 --> 01:45:02.200]  set up I mean do they know what they're doing are they out of control what's
[01:45:02.200 --> 01:45:10.680]  going on I think overall it's all about a control but on specific things they
[01:45:10.680 --> 01:45:14.760]  know what they're doing they know what they're doing in the Ukraine and notice
[01:45:14.760 --> 01:45:19.200]  that this week the House representatives overwhelmingly passed the
[01:45:19.200 --> 01:45:24.760]  resolution supporting the protest in the Ukraine is if that's got anything to do
[01:45:24.760 --> 01:45:34.000]  with the United States and they issued a threat of imposing sanctions should the
[01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:42.600]  Ukrainian police put the protest down so in other words if you treat people
[01:45:42.600 --> 01:45:46.200]  there the way our police treat protesters in the United States we're
[01:45:46.200 --> 01:45:52.120]  going to put sanctions on you so it this type of hypocrisy it must stun the
[01:45:52.120 --> 01:45:55.800]  world you know what happens to peaceful protesters in the United States they get
[01:45:55.800 --> 01:46:01.000]  beat up and tasered and tears at Paul Craig Roberts org let me ask you this
[01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:05.520]  question then looking at this what does your gut tell you how was the Ukraine
[01:46:05.520 --> 01:46:16.800]  gonna go well I don't know I think that ultimately it could split if you see the
[01:46:16.800 --> 01:46:22.520]  Ukraine has Ukraine has given up on putting down the protests and they even
[01:46:22.520 --> 01:46:27.640]  abolish the laws against protest and the police have been viciously attacked a
[01:46:27.640 --> 01:46:34.680]  lot of them have been burnt with mullet top cocktails they've been charged with
[01:46:34.680 --> 01:46:39.560]  bulldozers but they haven't replied with the kind of violence that you would
[01:46:39.560 --> 01:46:45.440]  expect any protesters in the United States acting like the Ukrainian
[01:46:45.440 --> 01:46:49.880]  protesters or would have been shot down the streets and killed because the
[01:46:49.880 --> 01:46:55.560]  Ukrainian protests are not peaceful they're extremely violent and the police
[01:46:55.560 --> 01:47:01.080]  are just sort of sitting there taking it so I think well it's clear the
[01:47:01.080 --> 01:47:04.720]  government knows it was unpopular to join the EU so they're acting like
[01:47:04.720 --> 01:47:08.920]  they're neutral but the orders gone down stand down let this happen fake Arab
[01:47:08.920 --> 01:47:13.360]  Spring and then there'll be a civil war it'll split up which is the grand
[01:47:13.360 --> 01:47:18.760]  strategy of tension that Brzezinski's been pushing and there you go I don't
[01:47:18.760 --> 01:47:23.680]  think I don't think the United States wants to split up because it does in
[01:47:23.680 --> 01:47:27.240]  the Western part will be reincorporating in Russia and they won't get the
[01:47:27.240 --> 01:47:33.800]  pipelines and and and that's right and so the rough state wouldn't be enough
[01:47:33.800 --> 01:47:41.240]  for the EU or the US but I think what may happen is that the EU simply
[01:47:41.240 --> 01:47:47.520]  disassociates from this policy and breaks off from it which leaves it as a
[01:47:47.520 --> 01:47:54.040]  Washington saying only and that then could weaken it and that could be good
[01:47:54.040 --> 01:47:56.720]  cop back up to let's let's give the economy a little bit of this segment
[01:47:56.720 --> 01:48:00.880]  the next one left what do you make of the I'm sure you've seen the market
[01:48:00.880 --> 01:48:05.120]  graph that the Wall Street Journal market watch has scary 1929 market chart
[01:48:05.120 --> 01:48:09.880]  gains traction if market follows the same script trouble lies directly ahead
[01:48:09.880 --> 01:48:15.280]  they're slowing down on QE unlimited dr. Roberts well you have to keep in mind
[01:48:15.280 --> 01:48:21.520]  that in 1929 the United States government wasn't in there manipulating
[01:48:21.520 --> 01:48:26.320]  every market there was no plunge protection team no no exchange
[01:48:26.320 --> 01:48:34.280]  stabilization plan there wasn't the Federal Reserve manipulating the price
[01:48:34.280 --> 01:48:42.320]  of gold driving up the price of bonds myth manipulating the stock market today
[01:48:42.320 --> 01:48:46.520]  all the markets are manipulated so it would be a mistake sure they are
[01:48:46.520 --> 01:48:51.400]  manipulated markets to the extent they're manipulated now how long can the
[01:48:51.400 --> 01:48:57.440]  false reality continue I think the Fed can manipulate things until the dollar
[01:48:57.440 --> 01:49:04.440]  goes the only vulnerability that I can see in this is if there's a run on the
[01:49:04.440 --> 01:49:14.040]  dollar and they because the Fed has really no way to guarantee to support the
[01:49:14.040 --> 01:49:18.640]  dollar price they can't print foreign currencies to buy dollars and apparently
[01:49:18.640 --> 01:49:25.080]  they've they don't any longer have any gold so I think that's right the Germans
[01:49:25.080 --> 01:49:29.960]  asked for their gold a year ago and have gotten basically none of it right I think
[01:49:29.960 --> 01:49:36.080]  that the vulnerability is the dollar the dollars is what was threatened by QE and
[01:49:36.080 --> 01:49:40.680]  I think the reason they're backing off on QE is trying to take some of the
[01:49:40.680 --> 01:49:45.400]  pressure off the dollar because if the dollar goes it's a bigger crisis than
[01:49:45.400 --> 01:49:52.440]  the banks fail and so their house of cards I think they can keep it going
[01:49:52.440 --> 01:50:00.160]  until there's a foreign run on the dollar and it may not happen it's just you
[01:50:00.160 --> 01:50:05.520]  don't know how long they can keep this going so that's really yet the the
[01:50:05.520 --> 01:50:08.680]  liberty the scientists we had created the greatest technologies they've been
[01:50:08.680 --> 01:50:12.800]  turned towards fraud the worlds of a technological disadvantage and we're
[01:50:12.800 --> 01:50:16.400]  being inserted into a false system and and I guess that's why we see the
[01:50:16.400 --> 01:50:22.760]  hubris are coming out of Washington right that's right look the trading desk as
[01:50:22.760 --> 01:50:29.680]  I understand it the trading desk of the New York Federal Reserve Bank it is now
[01:50:29.680 --> 01:50:37.160]  huge in it they can do everything stocks bonds commodities gold that foreign
[01:50:37.160 --> 01:50:43.040]  currencies and and they have the mechanisms in place to intervene in all
[01:50:43.040 --> 01:50:48.880]  of those markets and in recent columns that I did together with Dave Krasler
[01:50:48.880 --> 01:50:54.520]  experienced gold trader that we show we can we point out we can isolate to the
[01:50:54.520 --> 01:50:58.280]  minute the manipulation incredible I want to talk about that manipulation
[01:50:58.280 --> 01:51:02.840]  straight ahead with dr. Roberts attention gun owners it's reasonable to
[01:51:02.840 --> 01:51:06.280]  assume that at some point you may need to defend your family from an armed
[01:51:06.280 --> 01:51:10.560]  attack but is it reasonable to mount a defense without a strong offense in

[01:54:31.520 --> 01:54:35.920]  finishing up with you know the fact would that this whole thing's rigged and
[01:54:35.920 --> 01:54:38.920]  that just keeps coming out even the Rolling Stones and investigations you
[01:54:38.920 --> 01:54:43.960]  know years ago saying it's all rigged that was the headline what else is on
[01:54:43.960 --> 01:54:50.680]  your radar but where do we go from here what do we do well I don't know what
[01:54:50.680 --> 01:54:54.760]  what we can do Alex other than what you and I try to do is give people
[01:54:54.760 --> 01:55:02.320]  information that's more or less on the mark there's no recovery they continue
[01:55:02.320 --> 01:55:07.840]  to pretend that if you read Janet Yeltsin's testimony you know she's the
[01:55:07.840 --> 01:55:14.480]  new Fed chairman before Congress it was all about how we have this recovery which
[01:55:14.480 --> 01:55:21.280]  doesn't exist so when you're living a world of complete total disinformation
[01:55:21.280 --> 01:55:28.640]  what do what do you do what do you do what I suspect is going to happen but I
[01:55:28.640 --> 01:55:36.040]  don't know is the economy will continue to weaken this year it'll get weaker so
[01:55:36.040 --> 01:55:41.000]  that the deficit becomes a bigger issue again the debt ceiling has to be raised
[01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:51.520]  higher it puts more pressure and the Fed will have to restart quantitative
[01:55:51.520 --> 01:56:00.760]  easing or boost it or else they'll have to let the economy go to save the dollar
[01:56:00.760 --> 01:56:05.920]  it's hard to know where the Fed will come out on this because it's really
[01:56:05.920 --> 01:56:12.960]  caught between two big crises one is you cannot forever print your currency in
[01:56:12.960 --> 01:56:19.120]  such enormous amounts and not see the exchange value of your currency collapse
[01:56:19.120 --> 01:56:26.040]  and in the exchange markets so that is the limit on their ability to have
[01:56:26.040 --> 01:56:30.320]  quantitative easing on the other hand if they don't do quantitative easing and
[01:56:30.320 --> 01:56:36.920]  the economy is weakening they're faced with collapse of employment collapse of
[01:56:36.920 --> 01:56:41.360]  the bond market collapse the stock market and that's an immediate crisis so
[01:56:41.360 --> 01:56:46.880]  what's the slow weaning going to do then it's it's it's a the slow weaning
[01:56:46.880 --> 01:56:53.680]  right now I think it's show it's show to take pressure off the dollar it may be
[01:56:53.680 --> 01:57:00.000]  they're running out of the ability to manipulate the gold price and so they
[01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:06.400]  want to take pressure off of quantitative easing on the dollar you know
[01:57:06.400 --> 01:57:11.400]  one of the reasons for the rapid rise in gold is that people said well they're
[01:57:11.400 --> 01:57:15.760]  just going to inflate the currency away well quantitative easing so to prove
[01:57:15.760 --> 01:57:21.000]  that's what they're going to do so if they back off from it it sort of quits
[01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:27.480]  down the fears about the dollar being over produced I just don't think they
[01:57:27.480 --> 01:57:33.640]  have a good long-term plan for their economic situation well that's evident
[01:57:33.640 --> 01:57:41.400]  by the police state Europe absolutely and we also don't know what they make they
[01:57:41.400 --> 01:57:48.440]  may be caught off guard by what happens in the Ukraine you know now Kerry the
[01:57:48.440 --> 01:57:54.080]  Secretary of State is threatening France with sanctions crazy because French
[01:57:54.080 --> 01:57:59.840]  companies are going over to see about doing business with with the Iranians
[01:57:59.840 --> 01:58:04.040]  because it looks like the sanctions are going to be removed and so Kerry is
[01:58:04.040 --> 01:58:09.160]  threatening France well when you start threatening your own NATO allies you
[01:58:09.160 --> 01:58:13.880]  don't know what the result is we know that the German government is very upset
[01:58:13.880 --> 01:58:22.560]  with Washington they can't get his gold they don't want to be a drug into a war
[01:58:22.560 --> 01:58:28.200]  with Russia they're very uneasy about all this Ukraine business how does it
[01:58:28.200 --> 01:58:33.880]  benefit them to have the Russians simply deteriorating and we'll get you back up

[02:01:06.400 --> 02:01:10.240]  couple things I wanted to say one was something that you mentioned earlier
[02:01:10.240 --> 02:01:17.280]  about how the older generations just did everything and I just my grandfather
[02:01:17.280 --> 02:01:22.280]  died five years ago from Alzheimer's and he was one of those guys that you
[02:01:22.280 --> 02:01:26.680]  couldn't list on three pages of notebook paper all the things that he was a
[02:01:26.680 --> 02:01:31.440]  master of and they didn't watch television unless it was once a week to watch a
[02:01:31.440 --> 02:01:37.560]  ballgame they did things and they like to work and and work hard and work to the
[02:01:37.560 --> 02:01:44.520]  to be the best and so yeah that's absolutely they enjoyed working enjoyed
[02:01:44.520 --> 02:01:49.720]  it so much that they would and he tried to teach me so many things and I did
[02:01:49.720 --> 02:01:55.440]  take some from from what he gave me but I look at myself now and I you know I
[02:01:55.440 --> 02:02:00.840]  just look at and then I bad as modern good old boy gun owning libertarians are
[02:02:00.840 --> 02:02:07.640]  black white old young I don't care compared to what are our forebears

[02:03:59.440 --> 02:04:02.280]  and that's why I may just be honest when we come up with stuff and say this is the
[02:04:02.280 --> 02:04:06.200]  cleanest we can find anybody that says they're clean cleaner than us is in a

[02:04:19.280 --> 02:04:25.880]  of criticism is you know every time you bring up wow the devil or God and then

[02:08:53.760 --> 02:08:57.720]  beautiful they wanted us to see no difference between something ugly and
[02:08:57.720 --> 02:09:01.120]  something beautiful that's what you're also linty talks about you start by

[02:09:09.160 --> 02:09:14.080]  on war and the economy in this 1929 chart the Wall Street Journal is
[02:09:14.080 --> 02:09:17.840]  reporting on so much but I don't do pre-interviews with folks like Gerald
[02:09:17.840 --> 02:09:21.400]  Salente I'll just I'm gonna ask him in a moment what he wants to cover first we
[02:09:21.400 --> 02:09:27.240]  had a caller earlier Emma's just been a few minutes on this and go to Gerald the
[02:09:27.240 --> 02:09:32.200]  last caller and he said look I got I got a beef you talk about how the elite are
[02:09:32.200 --> 02:09:35.120]  into the occult how the elite are into Satanism because it's all about them
[02:09:35.120 --> 02:09:39.560]  and dominating others in pure power but then you say even if there isn't a
[02:09:39.560 --> 02:09:46.840]  devil or a God humans in this archetype aka Joseph Campbell aka Carl Jung the
[02:09:46.840 --> 02:09:52.360]  psychology are manifesting it and cultures manifest the same tyrannies
[02:09:52.360 --> 02:09:56.240]  over and over again give the rise of Greece city-states and then decline same
[02:09:56.240 --> 02:10:00.720]  decadence the rise of the Roman Republic incredible immoral science you know
[02:10:00.720 --> 02:10:04.680]  honorable people become corrupt degenerate again collapse the same
[02:10:04.680 --> 02:10:12.160]  cycle and they always get into the same behavior Aztecs Mayans African tribes
[02:10:12.160 --> 02:10:17.880]  human sacrifice dominance serial killer type status getting control and set up
[02:10:17.880 --> 02:10:22.120]  systems where people submit to them and the whole world becomes a system based
[02:10:22.120 --> 02:10:29.840]  on the likes and dislikes and the palate the the taste of the worst people in
[02:10:29.840 --> 02:10:33.920]  society all that evil men and tyrants seem to flourish is that good men and
[02:10:33.920 --> 02:10:44.360]  women do nothing so I am a Christian raised a Christian and I believe in the
[02:10:44.360 --> 02:10:48.440]  teachings of Christ and I personally have had spiritual experiences that are
[02:10:48.440 --> 02:10:54.920]  private and but I don't put people down who don't believe it or who question it
[02:10:54.920 --> 02:11:00.560]  because of the corrupt churches in the whole system I don't judge them as bad
[02:11:00.560 --> 02:11:04.400]  as the state-run religion is in this country across the board not just
[02:11:04.400 --> 02:11:08.440]  Christianity they've infiltrated all the groups the Muslims the Hindus the the
[02:11:08.440 --> 02:11:11.520]  atheists have kind of become the democratic type of government worshipping
[02:11:11.520 --> 02:11:15.440]  group we've had famous atheists on who actually agree with that like Stefan
[02:11:15.440 --> 02:11:18.560]  Molyneux he says no it's true they just get rid of God and then worship state
[02:11:18.560 --> 02:11:24.200]  that's why you say you have God-given rights because that's above the state so
[02:11:24.200 --> 02:11:28.320]  if you don't believe in God but in the system of God-given rights you're a
[02:11:28.320 --> 02:11:34.560]  humanist you are on top not the state so my issue is the system wants to get
[02:11:34.560 --> 02:11:39.200]  rid of the real teachings of Christ I believe in God I know it's real but I
[02:11:39.200 --> 02:11:43.320]  don't get mad at Jesse Ventura who's my friend who doesn't believe in it I don't
[02:11:43.320 --> 02:11:48.360]  get mad at at people so all I'm saying is whether you believe in the devil or
[02:11:48.360 --> 02:11:53.600]  not there is human destructive parasitic enslavement systems going into
[02:11:53.600 --> 02:11:59.080]  place that we should morally say are wrong well they tell you in psychology
[02:11:59.080 --> 02:12:02.360]  there is no right and wrong there is no morals but do what we say or you're
[02:12:02.360 --> 02:12:06.520]  racist turn your guns in or you know blah blah it's all
[02:12:06.520 --> 02:12:10.440]  guilty they just don't want you to have a moral compass that you set so they can
[02:12:10.440 --> 02:12:16.400]  set yours for you that's what I'm saying so that's the issue I'm an inclusive
[02:12:16.400 --> 02:12:24.680]  broadcast here and I don't judge people that believe in other other things I
[02:12:24.680 --> 02:12:29.800]  believe enough in my thoughts and then what I'm trying to put out that I believe
[02:12:29.800 --> 02:12:32.360]  it's going to lead people more to my point of view but I'm not going to beat
[02:12:32.360 --> 02:12:34.960]  them over the head with it some of the most corrupt out of control people are
[02:12:34.960 --> 02:12:38.880]  these churches and these clergy response teams in these in these systems
[02:12:38.880 --> 02:12:42.880]  it's all a bunch of Pharisees just like in Christ's time up on the hill saying I
[02:12:42.880 --> 02:12:47.680]  pray in public I'm good everybody else is bad that's that would make me an
[02:12:47.680 --> 02:12:52.240]  atheist looking at those people but I know that God will say I didn't know you
[02:12:52.240 --> 02:12:58.000]  and you can call it you know what what the Roanichel Salenta you can Martin
[02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:01.400]  Luther King talked about the universe bends towards justice whatever there is
[02:13:01.400 --> 02:13:04.240]  justice there is right right I know you got so much Gerald I appreciate you
[02:13:04.240 --> 02:13:07.800]  coming on when you already came on just a few weeks ago but back by popular
[02:13:07.800 --> 02:13:12.160]  demand trends research dot com trends journal dot com and I want to get into
[02:13:12.160 --> 02:13:15.360]  all the latest trends things are really moving quick we appreciate the update but
[02:13:15.360 --> 02:13:19.520]  you just heard this topic I introduced kind of a curveball here what is your
[02:13:19.520 --> 02:13:24.960]  view on what I just said I agree with you 100% you believe what you believe in
[02:13:24.960 --> 02:13:29.000]  you don't tell anybody else what they should believe in and you and you live
[02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:34.400]  by it and that's really all it's about and the people that proselytize you know
[02:13:34.400 --> 02:13:39.440]  that's their own trip and they shouldn't throw it on anybody else and it's you
[02:13:39.440 --> 02:13:43.120]  know I only speaking for myself because you know the motto of the trends
[02:13:43.120 --> 02:13:49.920]  journal think for yourself and my my definition of hell is taking that last
[02:13:49.920 --> 02:13:56.440]  breath and knowing that you lied to yourself and you weren't the person who
[02:13:56.440 --> 02:14:01.800]  you said you were or could have been and when all of these people talk about
[02:14:01.800 --> 02:14:07.040]  you know the politicians particularly what will their legacy be how will
[02:14:07.040 --> 02:14:13.920]  history judge them history doesn't judge you you judge yourself what's your
[02:14:13.920 --> 02:14:19.520]  legacy ask your soul who could care less are you proud of what you done Gerald I
[02:14:19.520 --> 02:14:23.080]  know you you coined that statement you say when you come on this show repeat
[02:14:23.080 --> 02:14:26.960]  that again because I think that is a great profound description of life and
[02:14:26.960 --> 02:14:31.760]  sums up what all honorable men and women believe in is that I make mistakes in
[02:14:31.760 --> 02:14:35.960]  the passion I'm not perfect I wrote but but in the final equation I really want
[02:14:35.960 --> 02:14:39.680]  people to succeed I want to be good I want to leave the world a better place
[02:14:39.680 --> 02:14:45.160]  than I came in because of my ancestors so many of them were so honorable it's
[02:14:45.160 --> 02:14:49.400]  about your family name it's about class go ahead well you know it's interesting
[02:14:49.400 --> 02:14:54.080]  you say that you know every morning I meditate and it's trying to clear my
[02:14:54.080 --> 02:14:57.520]  mind you know I want to keep the movie playing all the time so I try to quiet
[02:14:57.520 --> 02:15:02.720]  it and some of the thing I got into with probably within the last year now the
[02:15:02.720 --> 02:15:07.360]  guys have been up here to the trends research Institute I have a wall of the
[02:15:07.360 --> 02:15:14.440]  ancestors my my grandparents my great grandmother my parents aunts and uncles
[02:15:14.440 --> 02:15:22.960]  and I'm looking at it one day and I said to myself all I am are their DNA I
[02:15:22.960 --> 02:15:28.720]  didn't get here on my own just you know I just didn't pop out of it you know it's
[02:15:28.720 --> 02:15:35.040]  all of this DNA so I've got into the custom of every day and continually
[02:15:35.040 --> 02:15:39.960]  thinking throughout the day of thanking them for all that they've given me and
[02:15:39.960 --> 02:15:44.240]  all that they've taught me because all I am as I see it again not speaking for
[02:15:44.240 --> 02:15:51.480]  anyone is parts of them and a respect for the elders for all they I remember my
[02:15:51.480 --> 02:15:55.080]  father made so rest in peace I'd be complaining about something and he said
[02:15:55.080 --> 02:15:58.960]  you know you're always a bitch in a moment about something he's gonna tell you
[02:15:58.960 --> 02:16:03.680]  something I do a hundred times more for you than my dad did for me and it was
[02:16:03.680 --> 02:16:07.720]  true and they came here as immigrants they lost everything they were upstate
[02:16:07.720 --> 02:16:11.960]  New York they came as farmers and they got wiped out in floods and you know
[02:16:11.960 --> 02:16:15.360]  they they had to separate the kids and they grew up with their aunts and uncle
[02:16:15.360 --> 02:16:20.680]  you know so I appreciate and now as I become an adult I understand more and
[02:16:20.680 --> 02:16:25.160]  more what they did give me and and as you mentioned I'm not close to the guy
[02:16:25.160 --> 02:16:29.400]  that I was when I was in my you know growing up yeah I look back at the
[02:16:29.400 --> 02:16:34.600]  things that I did oh my god I did that you know so to me it's about leaving
[02:16:34.600 --> 02:16:40.240]  this life on a high note and the high note is simply being true to yourself you
[02:16:40.240 --> 02:16:45.640]  know the truth within everybody does everybody knows it you could be as all
[02:16:45.640 --> 02:16:49.880]  you want man when the lights go out and if you have time to think of that last
[02:16:49.880 --> 02:16:55.760]  thought you're gonna know where truth or lies are and that's it and it's an
[02:16:55.760 --> 02:16:59.960]  inside job to change the world and fix it we've got to change it one person at
[02:16:59.960 --> 02:17:04.120]  a time and we've got to have respect for ourselves as you've said Gerald a
[02:17:04.120 --> 02:17:08.360]  finish up talking about having respect for yourself and then I'm gonna come
[02:17:08.360 --> 02:17:12.200]  back and get into all the war news and economic news with you well you know it's
[02:17:12.200 --> 02:17:17.160]  dignity and respect takes a lot of levels to it you know I go out every time I
[02:17:17.160 --> 02:17:20.080]  go out you know I look around that I can't believe what the people have come
[02:17:20.080 --> 02:17:26.400]  to look like and it's a reflection on you know who they are and we become what
[02:17:26.400 --> 02:17:31.640]  they eat what they think what they watch and but it really goes much deeper than
[02:17:31.640 --> 02:17:35.760]  that as I think about it and again this is only where I say it it's about
[02:17:35.760 --> 02:17:41.680]  dignity courage and self-respect because when you have those elements you don't
[02:17:41.680 --> 02:17:49.720]  take anybody else's baloney you know if you look up to your political leader as
[02:17:49.720 --> 02:17:56.920]  I see it you're looking down to yourself so why would anybody want to do that so
[02:17:56.920 --> 02:18:02.440]  yeah as you know it's like the headlines all of a sudden and all of a
[02:18:02.440 --> 02:18:06.640]  sudden this is big news this is today's New York Times the world's going to crap
[02:18:06.640 --> 02:18:13.000]  right we got all these problems going on front page story before coming out a
[02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:19.400]  hard time coming up and this is about this Michael Sam who announced that he's
[02:18:19.400 --> 02:18:24.640]  gay what the hell do I care the gays have been out of the closet now for how
[02:18:24.640 --> 02:18:33.080]  long I got loads of gay friends who cares and then I hear Michelle Obama's say
[02:18:33.080 --> 02:18:37.360]  that this should be an inspiration to us hey man that's his trip I don't care
[02:18:37.360 --> 02:18:41.960]  who he's with who's doing what oh that's not my business I don't care and
[02:18:41.960 --> 02:18:48.800]  number two it's not an inspiration for me it's his trip and number three Michelle
[02:18:48.800 --> 02:18:53.880]  or do I have to call her her Highness I'm sick of them making her a movie star
[02:18:53.880 --> 02:18:58.240]  and all these other politicians in Hillary like you said politics is show
[02:18:58.240 --> 02:19:03.320]  business for ugly people I'm sick of them well not only that it's I say her
[02:19:03.320 --> 02:19:09.600]  Highness because we heard Obama's say basically it's good to be king you know
[02:19:09.600 --> 02:19:13.800]  I could do anything that I want they stored on your website and by the way
[02:19:13.800 --> 02:19:18.560]  great article by Kurt Nemo on what's going on in Ukraine and I like to talk
[02:19:18.560 --> 02:19:24.160]  about that later but when I say you know these people then the hypocrisy after
[02:19:24.160 --> 02:19:29.680]  her making all the news about how great this is and again you do it I agree I
[02:19:29.680 --> 02:19:33.480]  mean is Obama auditioning for a Mel Brooks movie says good for be king and
[02:19:33.480 --> 02:19:39.920]  they're like catapulting people yeah and now the thing is in 2008 he said he was
[02:19:39.920 --> 02:19:46.120]  against gay marriages how's that for hypocrisy it's all just politics it's a
[02:19:46.120 --> 02:19:50.320]  bunch of people that have no rudder they don't stand for anything and more and
[02:19:50.320 --> 02:19:53.280]  more in my life even I disagree with somebody if they're consistent I admire

[02:25:22.280 --> 02:25:27.520]  I mean I mean how far is this gonna go before it implodes you know I don't know
[02:25:27.520 --> 02:25:31.400]  and I'm wondering where the people are how come they're not standing up and
[02:25:31.400 --> 02:25:36.600]  speaking out and I just keep thinking you know and you know people say to me
[02:25:36.600 --> 02:25:42.040]  well you know we've been dumbed down yeah fine we've been dumbed down but you
[02:25:42.040 --> 02:25:46.680]  know look what happened over there in in World War two and the Germans weren't
[02:25:46.680 --> 02:25:51.800]  dumbed down in the 1930s they were at the height of Western civilization
[02:25:51.800 --> 02:25:56.680]  culturally philosophically the greatest pinnacle to that time was Germany
[02:25:56.680 --> 02:26:02.240]  right yeah so it's not a dumbing down process it's something greater than that
[02:26:02.240 --> 02:26:06.800]  and I don't know what it is but I can see where this is going you know look
[02:26:06.800 --> 02:26:14.600]  what they did with this Olympics I mean here you know if this is no it's a
[02:26:14.600 --> 02:26:20.680]  toothpaste bar oh yeah it's a dead so one before oh can you imagine they made
[02:26:20.680 --> 02:26:25.680]  that crap up there's toothpaste bar they're creating mentally illness a
[02:26:25.680 --> 02:26:29.880]  total mental illness where everyone's scared of everything exactly and what
[02:26:29.880 --> 02:26:34.000]  they did is the Americans said if you get on their planes going to so she
[02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:39.040]  watch out for them toothpaste bombs and all the major media repeated it and
[02:26:39.040 --> 02:26:46.560]  you're talking about sick people only only a psychotic person could make up
[02:26:46.560 --> 02:26:50.280]  something like a toothpaste bomb well statistically it's more dangerous to
[02:26:50.280 --> 02:26:54.080]  drive to work even if terror attacks are real they stop being cowards Americans
[02:26:54.080 --> 02:26:57.880]  never I'm gonna give up all my rides cuz somebody might kill somebody sometime
[02:26:57.880 --> 02:27:02.720]  I mean it's ridiculous I know but you're you're but to go back on to your
[02:27:02.720 --> 02:27:08.440]  question they come out with the most ludicrous crap and people believe it now
[02:27:08.440 --> 02:27:13.000]  where they're gonna go it can't pegs missiles next I mean anything don't make
[02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:20.600]  it up and and and the people keep buying it so I don't know what's going on and
[02:27:20.600 --> 02:27:25.000]  why and it goes back to the beginning what we're talking about courage dignity
[02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:28.800]  and respect and until people get and it's the products that you sell
[02:27:28.800 --> 02:27:32.880]  everything that you have on your on that you're offering to the people are
[02:27:32.880 --> 02:27:37.720]  going to help them physically emotionally and mentally and those are the
[02:27:37.720 --> 02:27:42.480]  ways you to me you have to build yourself because when you do you see
[02:27:42.480 --> 02:27:47.200]  right through this stuff who could believe this who could believe what
[02:27:47.200 --> 02:27:53.240]  they're telling us and and it's one lie after what you said about Obama we've
[02:27:53.240 --> 02:27:56.240]  got that clip or two days ago the French president knowing the cameras were
[02:27:56.240 --> 02:27:59.880]  running saying I can do whatever I want as president you know it's good to be
[02:27:59.880 --> 02:28:11.960]  king he joins Mel Brooks here it is obviously Gerald the establishment
[02:28:11.960 --> 02:28:15.200]  wants to set the president where we have a unitary executive what do you make of
[02:28:15.200 --> 02:28:20.360]  all the power grabbing we're seeing well you've heard me say this when when the
[02:28:20.360 --> 02:28:26.320]  panic of 08 began it's the merger of state and corporate powers it's called
[02:28:26.320 --> 02:28:32.640]  fascism and if anybody doesn't believe it look at the way they treat us I you
[02:28:32.640 --> 02:28:35.800]  know again we're going to be talking about what's going on in Ukraine later
[02:28:35.800 --> 02:28:41.280]  but all of these people complaining that you know they bug the phones over
[02:28:41.280 --> 02:28:44.720]  there look what they're doing to us they're listening to everything that
[02:28:44.720 --> 02:28:50.240]  we're doing they're watching us I don't need some cat in a black robe with a
[02:28:50.240 --> 02:28:56.160]  bad attitude calling himself judge to interpret the fourth amendment for me
[02:28:56.160 --> 02:29:00.560]  how dare them bug the US ambassador who's trying to overthrow their country
[02:29:00.560 --> 02:29:05.280]  I mean it's incredible there's total spying you're supposed to spy on foreign
[02:29:05.280 --> 02:29:09.360]  agents in your country you're not supposed to spy on the general public go
[02:29:09.360 --> 02:29:15.120]  ahead no and then when you read the comments coming from other people in the
[02:29:15.120 --> 02:29:20.880]  EU complaining about it and they say things like how dare that they they
[02:29:20.880 --> 02:29:27.600]  spy on high-level diplomats yeah you don't spy on them just spy on us we're
[02:29:27.600 --> 02:29:30.920]  just the stupid people stay there I want to go to Ukraine what else do you want

[02:35:01.280 --> 02:35:08.920]  the or much more out of the emerging markets I mean tens of probably a
[02:35:08.920 --> 02:35:12.000]  trillion that's what's happening in Turkey all over the place yeah as a
[02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:16.680]  matter of fact in Kazakhstan yesterday they just devalued the currency by 20
[02:35:16.680 --> 02:35:21.440]  percent and you don't have to be a trend forecaster a mathematician or an
[02:35:21.440 --> 02:35:25.720]  economist to figure this out there's a race to devalue or what yeah what
[02:35:25.720 --> 02:35:30.760]  happens is that all of the tape all of the stimulus pushed a lot of hot money
[02:35:30.760 --> 02:35:35.480]  into these emerging markets it's called a carry trade you borrow real cheap you
[02:35:35.480 --> 02:35:39.160]  bring it to another place we're gonna get a lot more for it it's as simple as
[02:35:39.160 --> 02:35:44.400]  that now with the tapering that money's flowing out but when the money flowed in
[02:35:44.400 --> 02:35:51.760]  it built the economies of places like Turkey like Brazil like South Africa it
[02:35:51.760 --> 02:35:58.320]  kept pumping up all India so now as the money flows out what they're trying to
[02:35:58.320 --> 02:36:03.120]  do because their their currencies are crashing is they're raising interest
[02:36:03.120 --> 02:36:08.040]  rates to protect their currency brilliant now let me get this straight
[02:36:08.040 --> 02:36:15.080]  your economy is going down you it's getting worse your currency is being
[02:36:15.080 --> 02:36:20.800]  devalued and to save that currency now you're going to raise interest rates to
[02:36:20.800 --> 02:36:27.360]  make it even more expensive to borrow brilliant that'll really help the
[02:36:27.360 --> 02:36:33.240]  economy go way down because that's what's happening so now as I mentioned
[02:36:33.240 --> 02:36:38.120]  it would be either devaluing or raising their interest rates the net result is
[02:36:38.120 --> 02:36:43.920]  the same recessions turn into depressions now going back to the biggest
[02:36:43.920 --> 02:36:52.400]  story we just saw the Dorgan pony show yesterday on I got it you can't call
[02:36:52.400 --> 02:36:58.960]  her fed chair woman she doesn't like that fed chair yelling at at the house
[02:36:58.960 --> 02:37:02.840]  meeting that's good say it how you how she says to do it or you're bad
[02:37:02.840 --> 02:37:08.240]  exactly yeah yeah as well we'd call it an Italian fudge a brute but we won't say
[02:37:08.240 --> 02:37:16.600]  that but I could call you that but anyway the she went on let me set the
[02:37:16.600 --> 02:37:24.640]  scene the markets are crashing a week and a half ago all over the Dow then all
[02:37:24.640 --> 02:37:30.760]  over the world the Asian markets the Dax in Europe all of them are going way way
[02:37:30.760 --> 02:37:36.640]  down every day every day every day everyone's waiting for Friday now this
[02:37:36.640 --> 02:37:42.760]  is a fact everyone was waiting for Friday to see what the job numbers would
[02:37:42.760 --> 02:37:48.520]  be so the job numbers come out the consensus on Wall Street we're gonna
[02:37:48.520 --> 02:37:54.760]  have an 189,000 new jobs and they got this guy over there there's shill that
[02:37:54.760 --> 02:38:00.760]  they're always quoting in all the newspapers everywhere this Mark Zandy he
[02:38:00.760 --> 02:38:12.240]  was up to 189 to 170,000 he comes in the numbers come in there are 113,000 the
[02:38:12.240 --> 02:38:19.480]  estimate on the streets 189,000 Zandy said when the September December numbers
[02:38:19.480 --> 02:38:25.400]  came out at 74,000 and anybody could look it up it's gone it's so you could
[02:38:25.400 --> 02:38:32.720]  Google it up and on CNBC back in December numbers connect these numbers
[02:38:32.720 --> 02:38:37.040]  now now they're wrong they're wrong they're gonna be readjusted I pay no
[02:38:37.040 --> 02:38:42.600]  attention they asked them how much is the December number going to be pushed up
[02:38:42.600 --> 02:38:49.640]  200k okay 200,000 so now remember going back to last Friday now they readjusted
[02:38:49.640 --> 02:38:53.480]  December numbers December numbers come out they readjust them it went from
[02:38:53.480 --> 02:39:01.920]  74,000 to 75,000 now you look at the market full when the numbers came out at
[02:39:01.920 --> 02:39:07.480]  830 the the the expectations were for the market the pre-market opening to be
[02:39:07.480 --> 02:39:13.440]  down the market opens up and on the good news of lousy job numbers the
[02:39:13.440 --> 02:39:20.120]  market pumps up and follows through a little bit on Monday and then Yellen
[02:39:20.120 --> 02:39:27.600]  comes out Yellen bloody murder and she says that they're gonna keep doing the
[02:39:27.600 --> 02:39:32.880]  tapering but if things get bad there'll be some quantitative easing the market
[02:39:32.880 --> 02:39:38.800]  shoot up more on what not on the fundamentals because here's the big
[02:39:38.800 --> 02:39:45.600]  lie or I should say cover-up that the Fed share said she makes a point of
[02:39:45.600 --> 02:39:51.920]  saying how great the drop the number dropped from the high unemployment rate
[02:39:51.920 --> 02:39:59.680]  of over 10% down now to approaching 6.5 what she failed to acknowledge in all
[02:39:59.680 --> 02:40:08.920]  of this BS that no one called her out on was a miss Fed chair the reason the
[02:40:08.920 --> 02:40:14.120]  number went so low is because of all those people that what they do now in
[02:40:14.120 --> 02:40:20.280]  the USA is once you're unemployed once you're no longer getting benefits once
[02:40:20.280 --> 02:40:24.920]  you can't find a job you're not count as unemployed anymore that's why the
[02:40:24.920 --> 02:40:31.000]  number went down so now today the markets are down what about 30 points as
[02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:37.120]  we're speaking 36 points there's nothing to drive the markets up there's only
[02:40:37.120 --> 02:40:43.240]  pressure to drive them down now let's look at gold since the beginning of the
[02:40:43.240 --> 02:40:49.840]  year gold has been steadily increasing all of the time and now it's
[02:40:49.840 --> 02:40:56.000]  approaching the 1300 mark now I want to make this clear you made it real clear
[02:40:56.000 --> 02:41:03.120]  when you said the markets were rigged and what I'm leading up to is that we know
[02:41:03.120 --> 02:41:08.760]  the forex market is rigged that's the market which trades currencies I'm not
[02:41:08.760 --> 02:41:16.160]  making it up it's a fact at the point of by the way the trading each day 5.3
[02:41:16.160 --> 02:41:21.840]  trillion dollar look at live or it just goes on on live or now here's some that
[02:41:21.840 --> 02:41:31.160]  guy Jim Kramer that's always on CNBC this was reported on yahoo yesterday
[02:41:31.160 --> 02:41:37.640]  here's the headline so everyone knows that I'm not making it up Jim Kramer
[02:41:37.640 --> 02:41:51.200]  yes the market is rigged yes the market is rigged there's no doubt about it so
[02:41:51.200 --> 02:41:56.560]  when I say gold is going up and the market is rigged it is not in the best
[02:41:56.560 --> 02:42:05.240]  interests of the central banks that are pumping out this cheap dough to see gold
[02:42:05.240 --> 02:42:13.520]  prices go up at the same time if you go to people's daily yesterday out of China
[02:42:13.520 --> 02:42:30.760]  the report is that gold consumption in China from 2012 to 2013 increased 41%
[02:42:30.760 --> 02:42:36.200]  so the rig market the paper market that the Goldman Sachs gang the Merrill
[02:42:36.200 --> 02:42:43.760]  Lynch mob the Deutsche Bank bandits keep rigging that's very different from the
[02:42:43.760 --> 02:42:47.960]  real gold and it shows the false reality we talked about this years ago they use
[02:42:47.960 --> 02:42:51.560]  naked shorts all of it they won't give Jeremy their gold they trade gold in the
[02:42:51.560 --> 02:42:55.120]  market they don't have India China they're all buying at record levels you
[02:42:55.120 --> 02:43:00.760]  can't buy physical gold for what they claim spot is the men sir running out and
[02:43:00.760 --> 02:43:03.720]  meanwhile I get emails and see comments going thought gold was a good
[02:43:03.720 --> 02:43:08.440]  investment I'll tell people buy it at 270 and it went up to almost 2000 and you
[02:43:08.440 --> 02:43:13.440]  know at 1200 3 to 1300 whatever I haven't sold one gold coin I bought one
[02:43:13.440 --> 02:43:17.560]  silver coin I bought because I know it's all a fraud and and regardless it's my
[02:43:17.560 --> 02:43:22.720]  emergency backup but the issue is it is rigged on every front and when gold
[02:43:22.720 --> 02:43:26.320]  shot up as you know a few weeks ago Gerald suddenly the dollar started going
[02:43:26.320 --> 02:43:32.600]  down but it's the seesaw but it can't go on it can't go on forever and so it's
[02:43:32.600 --> 02:43:37.400]  just so frustrating to watch them do this again this is Jim Kramer this is a
[02:43:37.400 --> 02:43:43.440]  guy that's on CNBC you know weekdays every night and on their shows saying
[02:43:43.440 --> 02:43:49.480]  that market is read well it's like people saying to you Gerald nothing ever
[02:43:49.480 --> 02:43:53.240]  collapsed you were wrong when by every real metric they're rigging all the
[02:43:53.240 --> 02:43:56.680]  jobless numbers and employment numbers we're in a depression most sectors the
[02:43:56.680 --> 02:44:01.760]  economy it's worldwide they got like 30 40 50% unemployment in areas of Europe
[02:44:01.760 --> 02:44:06.720]  I mean they're doing 100% taxes in France to pay the bills the world is
[02:44:06.720 --> 02:44:10.720]  going over the edge there's riots worldwide food riots inflation worldwide
[02:44:10.720 --> 02:44:13.800]  and they're going no none of that's happening there was no collapse well
[02:44:13.800 --> 02:44:17.880]  we're just like collapsing down to different levels in different strata
[02:44:17.880 --> 02:44:22.120]  towards the bottom but undoubtedly it's happening and then people say Alex
[02:44:22.120 --> 02:44:26.200]  where's the martial law well naked body scanners checkpoints NSA spying
[02:44:26.200 --> 02:44:30.480]  arresting people that demonstrate Obama saying he's above the law he's good at
[02:44:30.480 --> 02:44:35.800]  killing people no bid contracts funding al-qaeda I mean we are in a fascist
[02:44:35.800 --> 02:44:40.400]  system by degree and people keep saying well nobody's kicked my door down no
[02:44:40.400 --> 02:44:44.720]  they just made you go from 40 hours to 30 hours under Obamacare and you're
[02:44:44.720 --> 02:44:48.720]  going bankrupt I mean they just don't get it that we're trying to hold back
[02:44:48.720 --> 02:44:53.280]  the takeover and we've been somewhat successful and we're here trying to hold
[02:44:53.280 --> 02:44:56.840]  the gate up and they're going there's no enemy behind that gate as you know
[02:44:56.840 --> 02:45:02.440]  arrows shoot over the parapet at us again you know it's it's what we have
[02:45:02.440 --> 02:45:08.080]  right now to me is very reminiscent of prior to World War one you have a lot
[02:45:08.080 --> 02:45:13.440]  of inept incompetent sociopaths and psychopaths whether they're in government
[02:45:13.440 --> 02:45:17.720]  or the military that are leading the people to destruction over nothing and
[02:45:17.720 --> 02:45:25.600]  you know going back to the jobs here Home Depot plans 80,000 new higher
[02:45:25.600 --> 02:45:38.280]  ease Amazon 2,500 new workers okay Home Depot 80,000 right once upon a time in
[02:45:38.280 --> 02:45:44.040]  America there were these things called hardware stores and you could own one
[02:45:44.040 --> 02:45:48.840]  you had one on your block in your neighborhood in your village in your
[02:45:48.840 --> 02:45:53.640]  town if you lived in a city they were all over the place owned by individuals
[02:45:53.640 --> 02:46:01.560]  now is controlled by the multinational 80,000 slave landia jobs oh well it's
[02:46:01.560 --> 02:46:05.720]  worse than that as you know they cut most people from 40 to 20 hours not just
[02:46:05.720 --> 02:46:09.360]  30 and then they went out and hired other people so it's all part time like
[02:46:09.360 --> 02:46:12.640]  Walmart now because they say we want to keep our workers at the level to get
[02:46:12.640 --> 02:46:18.080]  welfare to supplement their job here Walmart's on record so that's not 80,000
[02:46:18.080 --> 02:46:24.920]  new jobs exactly and then you have Amazon so all you young boys and girls out
[02:46:24.920 --> 02:46:32.240]  there that want to get a college degree a BA or BS you could get one in packing
[02:46:32.240 --> 02:46:36.440]  and shipping because those are the kind of job except they're putting robots in
[02:46:36.440 --> 02:46:43.640]  now to replace them now this is from CNBC today just to show you how far out of
[02:46:43.640 --> 02:46:53.480]  touch everybody is this is the headline luxury CEO the poor should stop
[02:46:53.480 --> 02:47:02.920]  whining now this is from bud Cohnheim who is the head of Nicole Miller which is
[02:47:02.920 --> 02:47:12.720]  a luxury fashion product they sell luxury fashion shop he said we've got a
[02:47:12.720 --> 02:47:20.880]  country that the poverty level is wealth in 99% of the rest of the world so
[02:47:20.880 --> 02:47:29.680]  we're talking about woe is me woe is us woe is this the guy that's making oh my
[02:47:29.680 --> 02:47:38.160]  god he's making $35,000 a year why don't we try that out in India or some
[02:47:38.160 --> 02:47:48.040]  countries we can't even name China anyplace the guy is wealthy that's how
[02:47:48.040 --> 02:47:51.760]  out of touch they are yeah their new argument is but the cost of living here
[02:47:51.760 --> 02:47:57.120]  is a lot more to 10 20 30 times what it is in Africa this is this is a guy no
[02:47:57.120 --> 02:48:01.360]  no that's a new thing no no that's on article last week in AP the new rich
[02:48:01.360 --> 02:48:07.280]  make $4 a day the new middle class Gerald effect that's my next piece and I
[02:48:07.280 --> 02:48:10.080]  don't mean to do this it's horrible but I'm skipping the network break because I
[02:48:10.080 --> 02:48:13.320]  promise to go to calls but I've got to play this for you because I want you to
[02:48:13.320 --> 02:48:18.560]  hear this land marketing report from info wars nightly news and this aired
[02:48:18.560 --> 02:48:23.720]  last night or actually I guess on on Tuesday night no never was on Monday
[02:48:23.720 --> 02:48:27.960]  night and this is the new austerity at Whole Foods that they have the magazines
[02:48:27.960 --> 02:48:32.800]  everywhere it's like be a hobo be poor don't have a job don't take a bath live
[02:48:32.800 --> 02:48:36.240]  in a garbage can you've got the agenda 21 professor that's his department at UT
[02:48:36.240 --> 02:48:40.880]  the learned helplessness artificial scarcity things saying we all need to
[02:48:40.880 --> 02:48:44.640]  learn to live in 200 square foot apartments so you can pay more in taxes
[02:48:44.640 --> 02:48:48.080]  the political class that's their plan is make us so poor so they get more
[02:48:48.080 --> 02:48:53.120]  Obama tells Africans you can't have air conditioning or a car ever but he's
[02:48:53.120 --> 02:48:57.760]  you know got a fleet of jets it's literally their plan to make us poor and
[02:48:57.760 --> 02:49:02.880]  controlled and she went out to do a report on this so see how about raise the
[02:49:02.880 --> 02:49:07.840]  quality demand more quality no no this is about no no lower quality is good but
[02:49:07.840 --> 02:49:12.280]  only for us talk about a mind game here is her report I want to get your take on
[02:49:12.280 --> 02:49:16.360]  it Gerald and phone calls talk about trashing the American dream a Texas
[02:49:16.360 --> 02:49:20.480]  professor is going to be living inside of a dumpster for the next year Dr. Jeff
[02:49:20.480 --> 02:49:24.560]  Wilson moved into his new digs on Tuesday in an experiment designed to show
[02:49:24.560 --> 02:49:29.360]  students and the world that humans can live on a smaller scale and lessen our
[02:49:29.360 --> 02:49:33.680]  environmental footprint outfitting the tiny spaces step one in this trash can
[02:49:33.680 --> 02:49:37.440]  challenge and the goal is to design the dumpster to be as energy efficient as
[02:49:37.440 --> 02:49:42.520]  possible with solar panels and an energy producing toilet Wilson jokes he's part
[02:49:42.520 --> 02:49:47.520]  of the 1% saying his space is 1% the living space of the average American
[02:49:47.520 --> 02:49:53.280]  home using just 1% the water that's good waste professor dumpster as he's lovingly
[02:49:53.280 --> 02:49:57.640]  referred to by his students says the idea here is to ultimately show one can
[02:49:57.640 --> 02:50:03.360]  have a pretty good life in a dumpster oh and the dumpster diving professor says
[02:50:03.360 --> 02:50:08.320]  that he's gonna be transforming his trashy home into a capsule hotel by the
[02:50:08.320 --> 02:50:12.160]  end of the year much like the kind being called home in Japan built for
[02:50:12.160 --> 02:50:16.920]  salarymen who miss the last train home tiny capsule hotels are now the homes of
[02:50:16.920 --> 02:50:21.520]  last resort for Japan's unemployed looking more like a stack of washing
[02:50:21.520 --> 02:50:26.720]  machines there's six and a half foot by five foot rooms that contain a bed a TV
[02:50:26.720 --> 02:50:30.560]  and a pair of coffins but it seems the professor is just preparing the
[02:50:30.560 --> 02:50:34.440]  community for the coming tiny apartments that cities are toying with as an
[02:50:34.440 --> 02:50:38.200]  answer to overcrowding and the need for affordable housing micro units
[02:50:38.200 --> 02:50:43.280]  apartments of 500 square feet or less might be Austin's next big building
[02:50:43.280 --> 02:50:46.400]  trend that's because they restrict all the building here is that for those of
[02:50:46.400 --> 02:50:50.760]  us who can't afford it the answer is to just shove us into tiny little boxes
[02:50:50.760 --> 02:50:54.680]  like a can of sardines and then just culturally normalize it so we don't
[02:50:54.680 --> 02:50:59.480]  realize that we're actually being caged recent studies show that living in tiny
[02:50:59.480 --> 02:51:03.760]  spaces can actually be sizably hazardous to your health according to Dal
[02:51:03.760 --> 02:51:07.840]  Kopeck director of design for human health at Boston architectural college
[02:51:07.840 --> 02:51:11.960]  the space-saving trend of tiny apartments can lead to increased
[02:51:11.960 --> 02:51:16.960]  claustrophobia domestic abuse and alcoholism on top of that researchers
[02:51:16.960 --> 02:51:20.880]  believe that children need bigger spaces to flourish they say children raise
[02:51:20.880 --> 02:51:25.200]  confined spaces can end up becoming withdrawn and have trouble studying and
[02:51:25.200 --> 02:51:29.880]  consumptions the professor Wilson's dumpster has a stench of agenda 21 all
[02:51:29.880 --> 02:51:35.920]  over it as the globalist plan for the 21st century it's not what is agenda 21
[02:51:35.920 --> 02:51:41.520]  it's almost what isn't it is the blueprint it is the action plan to
[02:51:41.520 --> 02:51:50.480]  inventory and control all land all water all plants all minerals all
[02:51:50.480 --> 02:51:56.760]  construction all animals all means of production all energy all information
[02:51:56.760 --> 02:52:03.400]  and all human beings in the world it is a completely comprehensive plan it's
[02:52:03.400 --> 02:52:09.280]  global and it's implemented locally this map entitled the simulated reserve and
[02:52:09.280 --> 02:52:14.640]  corridor system to protect biodiversity illustrates how the UN's agenda 21 plan
[02:52:14.640 --> 02:52:19.400]  would work in the United States under this takeover all personal property
[02:52:19.400 --> 02:52:24.240]  rights would cease to exist the majority of the map is red-zoned mandated for
[02:52:24.240 --> 02:52:29.120]  little to no human use yellow zones are buffer zones for highly regulated use
[02:52:29.120 --> 02:52:35.480]  only in the scant green areas is normal human use allowed the tiny black dots
[02:52:35.480 --> 02:52:39.800]  are the dense mega cities where transportation will be tightly controlled
[02:52:39.800 --> 02:52:44.880]  freedom will be restricted and people will be packed in like sardines living
[02:52:44.880 --> 02:52:51.560]  in tiny units no bigger than a jail cell wake up America under agenda 21 in the
[02:52:51.560 --> 02:52:57.560]  name of sustainability we are building our own prisons for the greater good
[02:52:57.560 --> 02:53:01.280]  all right that's Leigh Ann McAdoo's excellent report and again in their own
[02:53:01.280 --> 02:53:04.680]  documents that we've covered here it's not that it's affordable to have
[02:53:04.680 --> 02:53:09.240]  something small and lowering standards it's they're gonna raise taxes to where
[02:53:09.240 --> 02:53:12.640]  you only get like five percent of your money then you go to these big things
[02:53:12.640 --> 02:53:18.400]  owned by Bloomberg and others is pushing it and you pay $10,000 a month for a
[02:53:18.400 --> 02:53:24.120]  200 square foot coffin I mean this is die a bollacle Gerald Salenta you talk
[02:53:24.120 --> 02:53:28.200]  about raising the quality 50 years ago McDonald's sort of putting signs up
[02:53:28.200 --> 02:53:31.840]  saying thank you as if he were supposed to throw away your own trash and then
[02:53:31.840 --> 02:53:35.320]  now everywhere's dirty no one picks up the trash it not just McDonald's
[02:53:35.320 --> 02:53:39.840]  anywhere and it's again it's about training us to be animals Gerald
[02:53:39.840 --> 02:53:45.920]  Salenta well that that was a great report and the message is really terrible
[02:53:45.920 --> 02:53:50.880]  and I love these guys professor you know get off your trip Jack professor he's
[02:53:50.880 --> 02:53:54.840]  a Houston television one of these guys that never works a day in his life and
[02:53:54.840 --> 02:53:59.840]  has a tenured professor he has a bow tie and he's gonna tell us what to do though
[02:53:59.840 --> 02:54:02.680]  by the way it turned out we went down and looked he doesn't even live in it
[02:54:02.680 --> 02:54:06.440]  it's all a big joke and he admitted I don't really stay there so he's not even
[02:54:06.440 --> 02:54:09.960]  living in the dumpster tell us how great it is he goes and lives in his house yeah
[02:54:09.960 --> 02:54:15.080]  again you know he's professors you know professor what and and and again there
[02:54:15.080 --> 02:54:19.400]  could be total jerks which most of a lot of them are because just to make this
[02:54:19.400 --> 02:54:24.280]  clear if the education system was working in this country particularly for
[02:54:24.280 --> 02:54:28.600]  what people are paying for it you think we'd be in the problems that we are so
[02:54:28.600 --> 02:54:32.960]  you get a clown like this guy again who's never worked a day in his life and
[02:54:32.960 --> 02:54:36.960]  only shoots his mouth off and tells everybody what to do what to think and
[02:54:36.960 --> 02:54:41.360]  to give them money so he could never get fired because he's protected well
[02:54:41.360 --> 02:54:44.800]  no that's how you're gonna get more money to pay his job and the $200,000
[02:54:44.800 --> 02:54:49.960]  degree is to live in a coffin while he lives in a house right so again when you
[02:54:49.960 --> 02:54:55.720]  go back to what I just read that story that broke on Bloomberg today about this
[02:54:55.720 --> 02:55:03.600]  guy from Nicole Miller saying that if you're making $35,000 a year stop complaining
[02:55:03.600 --> 02:55:07.040]  you could be living in China and if you were making that kind of money you'd be
[02:55:07.040 --> 02:55:14.000]  rich what that this guy you know did this guy should be brought up for some
[02:55:14.000 --> 02:55:18.120]  men you want prosperity you're evil it's so sexy to be poor except for the
[02:55:18.120 --> 02:55:21.720]  elite are all in red carpets of private jets let's talk to recent Texas he has a
[02:55:21.720 --> 02:55:24.560]  question which also lent a research for holding go ahead you're on the air with
[02:55:24.560 --> 02:55:31.560]  the trans forecaster yes sir I had a question about why our country pushes the
[02:55:31.560 --> 02:55:37.280]  petro dollar so much well because that keeps the dollar in charge Gerald yeah
[02:55:37.280 --> 02:55:43.160]  that that was a deal made by Kissinger back in the 70s when the when they took
[02:55:43.160 --> 02:55:48.400]  us off the gold standard and that was the deal that was made so that's why they
[02:55:48.400 --> 02:55:53.480]  do with the petro dollar that bailed out the United States and I had one more
[02:55:53.480 --> 02:56:00.600]  question for you is there a way to get rid of debt that someone basically ripped
[02:56:00.600 --> 02:56:04.640]  you off like basically I recently went to full sell online and they basically
[02:56:04.640 --> 02:56:10.160]  stole $8,000 for me to take court classes that were completely useless yeah
[02:56:10.160 --> 02:56:16.600]  and now charging me 34.57% and they're trying to pass laws to make you pay
[02:56:16.600 --> 02:56:20.320]  back student loans but that's illegal under our Constitution you can't have
[02:56:20.320 --> 02:56:24.200]  an injured servitude or debtor prisons Gerald we don't have any Constitution
[02:56:24.200 --> 02:56:28.560]  anymore what are you talking about they brought back debtor prisons in Illinois
[02:56:28.560 --> 02:56:33.560]  yeah it is a debtors prison I mean when these kids have taken them 20 years to pay
[02:56:33.560 --> 02:56:37.280]  off their America is a debtors prison that's what I mean you know so there's
[02:56:37.280 --> 02:56:41.320]  no Constitution anymore and you know I wanted to mention this too about the
[02:56:41.320 --> 02:56:46.560]  game being rigged and so I'm not making this up or you're not making it up this
[02:56:46.560 --> 02:56:53.040]  is from the Wall Street Journal last Friday speed traders get an edge so
[02:56:53.040 --> 02:56:57.360]  that shows you how these people buy information and they get like they're
[02:56:57.360 --> 02:57:03.000]  trading they're trading in nanoseconds to beat everybody else and the language
[02:57:03.000 --> 02:57:09.760]  is very very Orwellian high-frequency traders have been paying to get direct
[02:57:09.760 --> 02:57:14.640]  access to market move moving news releases a practice that can give firms
[02:57:14.640 --> 02:57:21.080]  the ability to trade fractions of a second ahead of less year ago fleet
[02:57:21.080 --> 02:57:27.840]  footed is footed investors less feet footed investors means you suckers
[02:57:27.840 --> 02:57:33.200]  that think that you're getting into the game and playing it now it even gets
[02:57:33.200 --> 02:57:44.600]  worse that's Friday today the article is traders with need for speed turn to
[02:57:44.600 --> 02:57:54.240]  laser beams that's how ridiculous this is trading in the markets and then when
[02:57:54.240 --> 02:58:00.240]  you put the whole package together who owns the companies well Hines well they
[02:58:00.240 --> 02:58:04.640]  were bought out by Buffett and that Brazilian group and then you keep going
[02:58:04.640 --> 02:58:09.880]  down the list all the companies in America the big ones many of them aren't
[02:58:09.880 --> 02:58:14.880]  owned by the people of the companies of the stockholders they're owned by private
[02:58:14.880 --> 02:58:20.080]  equity groups hedge funds it's a multinational takeover they used
[02:58:20.080 --> 02:58:24.120]  derivative garbage money to buy it all Gerald I'm gonna come back in five more

[03:00:44.840 --> 03:00:50.600]  question for Gerald Salente go ahead. Hey Gerald it's nice to talk to you on
[03:00:50.600 --> 03:00:56.680]  air. Go ahead what's your question thank you. I was wondering like there was a
[03:00:56.680 --> 03:01:01.560]  gentleman posted a thing about the scary pair parallel between the market crash
[03:01:01.560 --> 03:01:08.440]  of 29 and the current period and this guy from the Atlantic he wrote it
[03:01:08.440 --> 03:01:14.200]  basically an argument saying that oh this is nothing to worry about and Matthew
[03:01:14.200 --> 03:01:18.760]  O'Brien yeah he's basically saying oh you can't worry about these parallels
[03:01:18.760 --> 03:01:23.440]  because you got to worry about the double y-axis you know I mean it's that
[03:01:23.440 --> 03:01:28.120]  really like is it something I know you've been talking about it forever but
[03:01:28.120 --> 03:01:32.760]  they're just popping the whole system up. Well yeah I mean that's that's what we
[03:01:32.760 --> 03:01:36.920]  had a guest on Paul Craig Roberts earlier it's the same thing it's rigged but
[03:01:36.920 --> 03:01:42.120]  it still will end up in imploding Gerald. Yeah no Dr. Paul Craig Roberts so you
[03:01:42.120 --> 03:01:44.680]  know he's a contributor to the transjournal he knows this stuff I mean
[03:01:44.680 --> 03:01:49.560]  guy was an assistant treasury secretary to Reagan and he's one of the you know
[03:01:49.560 --> 03:01:55.080]  he's a he's a real straight deal this guy I mean he could have sold out like the
[03:01:55.080 --> 03:01:58.840]  rest of them but you know he's just interested in the truth and he has the
[03:01:58.840 --> 03:02:05.040]  the well-based knowledge of being on the inside and knowing what it is you have
[03:02:05.040 --> 03:02:10.600]  these things called you know these ongoing monetary transactions in the in
[03:02:10.600 --> 03:02:19.040]  the ECB in Europe and in Germany they had brought a court case that no you
[03:02:19.040 --> 03:02:23.040]  can't do this you just can't keep dumping money into the system and of
[03:02:23.040 --> 03:02:27.400]  course the court backed off on it and they're letting it happen so whether
[03:02:27.400 --> 03:02:33.840]  it's in the United States whether it's in Europe and by the way what people
[03:02:33.840 --> 03:02:37.960]  really should start doing now is to pay attention what's going on in China
[03:02:37.960 --> 03:02:43.040]  because all this is tying together the Chinese did the same thing the United
[03:02:43.040 --> 03:02:48.400]  States they just have a different name for it and and with stimulus and now
[03:02:48.400 --> 03:02:55.080]  some 30 to 40 percent of the Chinese GDP is built upon borrowing money from
[03:02:55.080 --> 03:02:59.960]  shadow banking which what we used to call in the Bronx loan sharks and like
[03:02:59.960 --> 03:03:03.600]  that person they called in that has a dirty deal from the loan shock that's
[03:03:03.600 --> 03:03:09.120]  and by the way now they want the post office to have payday loans exactly so
[03:03:09.120 --> 03:03:14.960]  now what's going on in China interest rates are going up interest rates are
[03:03:14.960 --> 03:03:19.480]  going to go up across the board you're seeing in hot residential markets that
[03:03:19.480 --> 03:03:26.080]  were building in 2013 and read in real estate they're cooling down interest
[03:03:26.080 --> 03:03:31.840]  rates are going to go up as this tapering goes up so going back to the
[03:03:31.840 --> 03:03:38.400]  1929 parallel they're going to do everything they can to keep pumping money
[03:03:38.400 --> 03:03:44.840]  into the system and so they're going to pretend to taper they're not going to
[03:03:44.840 --> 03:03:52.720]  be able to do it because you can see by the data it's weak at every level so
[03:03:52.720 --> 03:03:56.880]  they're going to juice it again and when they do that's when you're going to see
[03:03:56.880 --> 03:04:00.760]  the panic hit because that's when you're going to start seeing real currency
[03:04:00.760 --> 03:04:05.040]  devaluations that's when you're going to see gold and silver prices skyrocket
[03:04:05.040 --> 03:04:09.480]  because they've been artificially holding them back and they only could do it for
[03:04:09.480 --> 03:04:12.400]  so long all the paper is going to be worthless so you won't even want to sell
[03:04:12.400 --> 03:04:17.560]  your gold at that time except for basic items Gerald Solente folks can subscribe
