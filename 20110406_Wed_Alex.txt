[00:00:04.827 --> 00:00:09.672]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.672 --> 00:00:11.254]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.254 --> 00:00:12.795]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.795 --> 00:00:17.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.064]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:28.308 --> 00:00:40.514]  Well, Reuters is reporting that OPEC is saying if the Middle East unrest continues, oil may go to $200 to $300 a barrel in the next few months.
[00:00:40.514 --> 00:00:55.141]  As the unrest in Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Syria, obviously the war going on in Libya, it is all just intensifying and they've got a bunch of analysts in this Reuters report that came out yesterday.
[00:00:56.061 --> 00:00:58.882]  In fact, guys, re-pull me that headline from yesterday, please.
[00:00:58.882 --> 00:01:03.724]  Oil to go to $200 to $300 a barrel on Saudi unrest.
[00:01:03.724 --> 00:01:23.391]  So, Lindsey Williams called it six months ago, in October of 2010, from Ken Fromm, who then died two months later of cancer, former head of operations, Atlantic Richfield, with his inside knowledge, and the other still-living CEO, former CEO, even more high-powered of another major oil company,
[00:01:24.131 --> 00:01:24.612]  I don't know.
[00:01:39.722 --> 00:01:48.589]  That said, obviously it is Wednesday, the sixth day of April 2011, and we're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:01:48.589 --> 00:01:56.094]  I'm going to open the phones up coming up later in this hour, and we're going to go over all of the important news as well.
[00:01:56.094 --> 00:01:58.416]  Rebel-held Libya running out of cash.
[00:01:58.416 --> 00:02:00.878]  The rebels say NATO is the problem.
[00:02:00.878 --> 00:02:02.419]  Europe feels the strain as U.S.
[00:02:02.419 --> 00:02:04.660]  alters Libya policy.
[00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.523]  Oil near two-and-a-half-year peak on Middle East weak dollar.
[00:02:08.643 --> 00:02:12.704]  Defense Secretary meeting with Saudi King to discuss Mideast unrest.
[00:02:12.704 --> 00:02:16.426]  Tired of violence, Mexicans ready for mass protest.
[00:02:16.426 --> 00:02:20.087]  Obama rolling out his new Facebook campaign.
[00:02:20.087 --> 00:02:22.028]  Commodities gold hits new record.
[00:02:22.028 --> 00:02:23.588]  Brent oil above $122 a barrel right now.
[00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:39.632]  Obviously, it made big news in USA Today, Politico, The Hill, New York Times, when Ron Paul said that he will announce one way or the other in a month or less.
[00:02:39.632 --> 00:02:43.833]  He was going to be running for president and basically hinted that he would be running for president.
[00:02:43.833 --> 00:02:47.374]  His son, Rand Paul, is in the news today saying he expects him to run.
[00:02:47.374 --> 00:02:50.494]  We're going to be breaking all of that down.
[00:02:50.494 --> 00:02:53.755]  But we've got a psyop going on here.
[00:02:55.063 --> 00:03:15.678]  Where we're so distracted with the economy, we're so distracted with what's happening as well with the new wars and NCAA and other distractions that we're missing the forest for the trees here.
[00:03:15.678 --> 00:03:19.441]  Scores of mainstream publications are quietly reporting
[00:03:20.543 --> 00:03:29.656]  That the United States, Canada and even the EU are set to raise what they say is safe radiation levels.
[00:03:29.656 --> 00:03:33.161]  And of course we've already had Dr. Busby on the broadcast.
[00:03:34.838 --> 00:03:51.986]  There's a chemical physicist breaking down that what they already say is safe levels is the key to the entire whitewash with all the different forms of radiation that are being loosed upon the planet through reactors, DU, nuclear weapons production facilities, enrichment facilities.
[00:03:51.986 --> 00:04:01.891]  But now that's becoming more evident than ever with them just saying we'll just raise the level and not report to people what's in the produce, what's in the milk.
[00:04:01.891 --> 00:04:02.912]  India has banned
[00:04:04.258 --> 00:04:11.762]  Any Japanese fish, seafood, produce, fruits, vegetables, beef coming into India.
[00:04:11.762 --> 00:04:25.789]  Other countries are moving to do that, though they're on the other side of the world compared to where the winds, the winds start over Japan, go over the Pacific, hit North America, Atlantic, Europe, Middle East, Central Asia.
[00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:28.791]  And so India is literally on the other side of the world comparatively.
[00:04:29.451 --> 00:04:31.072]  Well, they're geographically closer to Japan.
[00:04:31.072 --> 00:04:36.316]  They're on the other side of the world, where this radiation's coming in, but they're banning the importation.
[00:04:36.316 --> 00:04:37.898]  But here, there's no discussion about that.
[00:04:37.898 --> 00:04:43.042]  They're saying, well, if it does get higher in the food, which it's showing, we'll just say it's safe.
[00:04:43.042 --> 00:04:44.483]  Wave the magic pixie wand.
[00:04:44.483 --> 00:04:46.504]  So we're going to be covering that first.
[00:04:46.504 --> 00:04:49.927]  When we get back, then into all the economic, military news.
[00:04:49.927 --> 00:04:51.368]  Lindsey Williams coming up.
[00:04:51.368 --> 00:04:54.731]  InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, GCNLive.com.
[00:04:54.731 --> 00:04:55.371]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:55.371 --> 00:04:55.772]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.403 --> 00:05:05.424]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:05:05.424 --> 00:05:08.664]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:05:08.664 --> 00:05:13.466]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:05:13.466 --> 00:05:19.847]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:05:19.847 --> 00:05:22.088]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:05:22.628 --> 00:05:22.948]  Tim Geithner?
[00:05:22.948 --> 00:05:23.448]  Bernanke?
[00:05:23.448 --> 00:05:24.129]  They're arsonists!
[00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:25.409]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:27.650]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:05:41.536 --> 00:05:48.825]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the republic.
[00:05:48.825 --> 00:05:57.937]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:06:00.365 --> 00:06:03.948]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[00:06:03.948 --> 00:06:05.249]  It ended on June of 2009.
[00:06:05.249 --> 00:06:09.652]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[00:06:09.652 --> 00:06:15.596]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[00:06:15.596 --> 00:06:17.738]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[00:06:17.738 --> 00:06:20.420]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:27.264]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[00:06:27.264 --> 00:06:29.466]  They both make fabulous investments.
[00:06:29.466 --> 00:06:34.829]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[00:06:34.829 --> 00:06:40.093]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[00:06:40.093 --> 00:06:45.476]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long-term.
[00:06:45.476 --> 00:06:48.418]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[00:06:48.658 --> 00:06:51.659]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[00:06:51.659 --> 00:06:52.439]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[00:06:52.439 --> 00:06:53.079]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:56.380]  citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:07:07.803 --> 00:07:10.365]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:07:10.365 --> 00:07:15.747]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:07:15.747 --> 00:07:18.789]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:07:18.789 --> 00:07:21.110]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:27.353]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:07:27.353 --> 00:07:30.735]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:07:30.735 --> 00:07:32.116]  Recently, he created a video
[00:07:32.256 --> 00:07:32.496]  We're good.
[00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:09.803]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:08:09.803 --> 00:08:11.405]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.405 --> 00:08:12.926]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:12.926 --> 00:08:17.129]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.129 --> 00:08:21.212]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:33.766 --> 00:08:35.268]  Welcome my friends, welcome.
[00:08:35.268 --> 00:08:40.273]  It is Wednesday, the 6th day of April 2011.
[00:08:40.273 --> 00:08:50.965]  Pastor Lindsey Williams, with his very important connections into former oil company CEOs and executives, dropped the key bombshell on us in October.
[00:08:52.146 --> 00:09:07.296]  What, 22nd, 2010, now six months ago that the globalists would trigger destabilization in the Middle East, leading directly to massive oil price increases within six months to a year of $150 to $200 a barrel.
[00:09:07.296 --> 00:09:08.897]  Brent crude is now trading at $122 a barrel.
[00:09:08.897 --> 00:09:10.899]  That is the news headlines today.
[00:09:10.899 --> 00:09:11.779]  Here is Reuters yesterday.
[00:09:20.745 --> 00:09:20.925]  I think?
[00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:49.382]  Also, new article that just went up minutes ago at InfoWars.com.
[00:09:49.382 --> 00:09:53.183]  We're going to be breaking down Ron Paul gold commodity prices.
[00:09:53.183 --> 00:09:57.145]  Big event signaling economic collapse has begun.
[00:09:58.385 --> 00:10:02.567]  Signaling big event, economic collapse.
[00:10:02.567 --> 00:10:09.691]  And so that report and the video and audio interview with Ron Paul is up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:10:09.691 --> 00:10:18.716]  That interview made headlines today and yesterday in more than 10 major newspapers, including USA Today, The Hill, Politico, and the New York Times.
[00:10:19.436 --> 00:10:25.560]  Headline from Infowars.com, Ron Paul to announce presidential bid next month.
[00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:32.904]  Appearing on the Alex Jones Show today, Texas Representative Ron Paul said he will make a final decision within a month on whether he will run for president in 2012.
[00:10:32.904 --> 00:10:38.388]  The congressman added that he will soon make a token decision if he will participate in a presidential debate.
[00:10:38.888 --> 00:10:40.468]  to be held in South Carolina.
[00:10:40.468 --> 00:10:42.749]  And the way he said it is he's going to take part in that.
[00:10:42.749 --> 00:10:57.753]  In May, Dr. Paul said he will likely agree to be included in the debate, which is again saying a token that he's in the race, between potential presidential contenders without a commitment to run or officially filing papers declaring his candidacy.
[00:10:57.753 --> 00:11:01.154]  That will be covered a little bit later in the hour in more detail.
[00:11:01.154 --> 00:11:04.115]  Here is The Hill reporting on our report.
[00:11:04.115 --> 00:11:06.396]  Ron Paul to make presidential decision in next month.
[00:11:07.569 --> 00:11:07.809]  I think?
[00:11:31.178 --> 00:11:36.722]  The latest on GOP budget proposal, not a penny for Obamacare, certainly good news.
[00:11:36.722 --> 00:11:43.987]  With the Republicans so far keeping their promise because of massive public backlash on that front, they smell victory.
[00:11:43.987 --> 00:11:53.314]  The question is, will they reverse themselves once they get back into full power over the House, Senate, and perhaps in the next two years, or year and a half, the presidency of the United States.
[00:11:53.314 --> 00:12:00.259]  The globalists, of course, do still control both parties, but the Republicans are playing the part right now as the populist rebels.
[00:12:01.676 --> 00:12:18.847]  Also, there's a AP article promoting climate manipulation and geoengineering as a way to save us from global warming, as they admit more and more that they are chemtrailing us, but they say all of the previous chemtrailing has simply been scientific testing, that they may increase the operations.
[00:12:18.847 --> 00:12:20.749]  So they're now introducing that to the public.
[00:12:20.749 --> 00:12:24.071]  Commodities, gold has hit record new high, and again Brent...
[00:12:24.551 --> 00:12:29.452]  Crude above $122 per barrel, that out of Reuters today.
[00:12:29.452 --> 00:12:33.513]  We're gonna be going over all of that in great detail.
[00:12:33.513 --> 00:12:39.295]  And Lindsey Williams, as I said, is joining us coming up in about 50 minutes from now for the full second hour.
[00:12:39.295 --> 00:12:45.277]  We'll also open the phones up for folks who have any questions or comments for Pastor Lindsey Williams.
[00:12:46.451 --> 00:12:54.793]  That said, before I came into the office this morning, my wife had been reading InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com the last few days, and she said, I've been listening to your show.
[00:12:55.993 --> 00:13:00.477]  And I've heard you talk some about this, but isn't this the big top story?
[00:13:00.477 --> 00:13:03.019]  My wife rarely gets involved in the show.
[00:13:03.019 --> 00:13:09.684]  Years ago, she was my producer and webmaster for InfoWars.com, going back more than 10 years ago, so she's always been involved.
[00:13:09.684 --> 00:13:15.508]  But normally, she just doesn't have a lot of input listening to the show on which direction I should go.
[00:13:15.508 --> 00:13:16.869]  And I really thought about it.
[00:13:16.869 --> 00:13:19.251]  I said, you know, you're right.
[00:13:19.251 --> 00:13:22.133]  I've talked about it quite a bit, but not as much as we should.
[00:13:22.133 --> 00:13:23.735]  I talked about it for an hour Sunday.
[00:13:25.325 --> 00:13:38.747]  An hour on Monday, probably 30 minutes yesterday, but really, she's right that even though the mainstream media is spinning this and acting like it's no big deal, it's a huge deal.
[00:13:38.747 --> 00:13:52.770]  We have the New York Times reporting, we have California Papers reporting as of Sunday, 181 times safe levels of radioactive iodine-131 found via the state monitoring facility at Berkeley.
[00:13:53.490 --> 00:14:16.072]  In the tap water, minor footnote in the news, I now have articles out of the EU, articles out of Canada, articles out of the US, where quietly the EPA of our government, but also other governments, environmental monitors, agencies, are announcing that they are set to raise the safe levels of radioactive isotopes
[00:14:16.934 --> 00:14:30.479]  I guess they wave the magic wand and tell us what's safe, and many of the radiologists, nuclear physicists, chemical physicists we've had on have pointed out that they already have radiation set at a level that they say is safe that's not safe.
[00:14:30.479 --> 00:14:45.185]  Just like they say DU is now safe for the troops, though 20 years ago, before that, they said it was so deadly they couldn't use it unless they were in a full-out nuclear war already as an emergency weapon for ground troops to be able to take on the 10 to 1 superiority of Russian armor.
[00:14:45.785 --> 00:14:50.066]  Pouring in to the what folder gap in Germany and other areas.
[00:14:50.066 --> 00:14:55.587]  It was an emergency weapon to be served out of the armories only once nuclear war had already started.
[00:14:55.587 --> 00:15:00.367]  But in 91 they made the decision to wave the magic wand and say that it was no longer a problem.
[00:15:00.367 --> 00:15:06.408]  The troops could use it at shooting ranges, proving grounds, in wars, bomb civilian centers.
[00:15:06.408 --> 00:15:12.910]  Israel used it against Lebanon, Gaza, even though it blows right back into Israel.
[00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:14.930]  The winds blow from the north and from the
[00:15:16.494 --> 00:15:16.734]  Yes.
[00:15:37.088 --> 00:15:41.731]  In plain view, they're now reporting radiation dumping into the ocean.
[00:15:41.731 --> 00:15:54.559]  Reuters, AP, LA Times, Kyoto News, we covered this yesterday, all with the headlines, radiation 7.5 million, and that's confirmed.
[00:15:54.559 --> 00:16:04.185]  Safe levels being dumped directly out of the reactors into the Pacific Ocean with those currents going right towards the U.S., though it'll take, they say, six weeks on average to get here.
[00:16:04.185 --> 00:16:05.987]  I mean, this is just incredible.
[00:16:07.738 --> 00:16:08.838]  7.5 million times.
[00:16:08.838 --> 00:16:14.361]  Now the Japanese are saying there's so much radiation coming out that it's incalculable.
[00:16:14.361 --> 00:16:18.804]  So many different variants, so many different types, uranium, plutonium, cesium.
[00:16:21.025 --> 00:16:21.626]  I don't
[00:16:42.339 --> 00:16:46.480]  Is that the media here is reporting on this in minor footnotes.
[00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:54.322]  If you go to InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, we have boil-down articles with little snippets from mainstream news and then links to the news.
[00:16:54.322 --> 00:16:56.843]  We're buried in each article.
[00:16:56.843 --> 00:17:04.024]  They take just incredible news and just bury it like it's no big deal.
[00:17:04.024 --> 00:17:10.066]  And NKH World reporting, plant radiation monitor says levels immeasurable.
[00:17:11.707 --> 00:17:12.227]  I don't think so.
[00:17:30.811 --> 00:17:40.781]  Only shipped in frozen food, vegetables, fruit, poultry, beef, fish from the Americas and from Asia.
[00:17:40.781 --> 00:17:44.785]  The grain, the milk, all of it was just thrown away.
[00:17:44.785 --> 00:17:50.351]  Production shut down for at least six months until the levels went down in the food, especially for children.
[00:17:50.871 --> 00:17:56.676]  And we've had nuclear physicist John saying, you know, this 181 times level being safe.
[00:17:56.676 --> 00:18:02.020]  Dr. Busby said, let's get Busby back on tomorrow if we can, or even today, if he could do it in the last 30 minutes.
[00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:03.582]  I know Williams is coming up.
[00:18:03.582 --> 00:18:10.147]  That he would look at, still talking to a physician yourself, but that children might want to start taking potassium iodate.
[00:18:12.987 --> 00:18:13.668]  On the West Coast.
[00:18:24.875 --> 00:18:26.175]  I can't make that call for you.
[00:18:26.175 --> 00:18:30.716]  That's a call for you to make, but it's out of sight, out of mind.
[00:18:30.716 --> 00:18:34.697]  They're just burying this information that, oh, it's no big deal.
[00:18:34.697 --> 00:18:43.119]  The EPA and the EU are set to raise the levels of what they say is safe in beef, in poultry, in milk.
[00:18:43.119 --> 00:18:44.579]  Obviously, cows are large.
[00:18:44.579 --> 00:18:49.420]  They eat a lot of grass with the accumulated fallout coming in.
[00:18:52.762 --> 00:19:02.348]  It bioaccumulates there and then the cows excrete it, we breathe it as well, but they also excrete it in the higher levels.
[00:19:02.348 --> 00:19:13.316]  If the water's got 181 times in the Bay Area, safe levels of radioactive iodine, can you imagine when the cows bioaccumulate that and what's going on in the milk?
[00:19:13.316 --> 00:19:17.058]  And the EPA's answer is they're not giving out radiation numbers.
[00:19:17.058 --> 00:19:21.361]  Washington and Oregon and California have.
[00:19:23.121 --> 00:19:34.248]  And so there's just a complete whitewash and ongoing cover-up of this happening, and even I'm susceptible to this, that when they're not making a big deal of it, I don't make as big a deal as I should.
[00:19:34.248 --> 00:19:40.852]  I mean, compared to the mainstream media, sure, we're covering it, but I'm going to come back and go through more of these articles and some of the numbers here.
[00:19:40.852 --> 00:19:45.495]  I mean, the larger question is for the listeners, I'd like to get your take on this, is what do we do about this?
[00:19:46.135 --> 00:19:48.557]  How do we force them to stop this cover-up?
[00:19:48.557 --> 00:19:54.122]  Or to not say, well, we'll just raise the levels of what we say are safe in the food and water?
[00:19:54.122 --> 00:19:55.644]  This is a big, big deal.
[00:19:55.644 --> 00:19:57.205]  We'll continue with this on the other side.
[00:19:57.205 --> 00:20:00.808]  It's all up at InfoWars.com.
[00:20:00.808 --> 00:20:07.755]  Freedom, the blistering anti-globalist anthem from the rock band Ravelin.

[00:21:04.953 --> 00:21:05.533]  The U.S.
[00:21:05.533 --> 00:21:12.798]  government is a Ponzi scheme that relies on the Treasury continuously selling large amounts of government bonds to foreign central banks.
[00:21:12.798 --> 00:21:15.520]  With Japan about to become a seller of U.S.
[00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:18.862]  bonds in order to rebuild its own nation, and the U.S.
[00:21:18.862 --> 00:21:25.507]  antagonizing China by calling them currency manipulators, the Federal Reserve, which is already buying about 70% of U.S.
[00:21:25.507 --> 00:21:28.149]  Treasuries, will soon be the only buyer left of U.S.
[00:21:28.149 --> 00:21:28.589]  Treasuries.
[00:21:29.009 --> 00:21:32.532]  Our friends at the National Inflation Association believe that the U.S.
[00:21:32.532 --> 00:21:38.475]  dollar will soon become worthless and Americans will see the purchasing power of their incomes and savings destroyed.

[00:23:37.594 --> 00:23:44.659]  This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:23:44.659 --> 00:23:45.540]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:48.802]  I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.

[00:24:06.032 --> 00:24:07.893]  Watch me!
[00:24:07.893 --> 00:24:09.634]  Watch me!
[00:24:09.634 --> 00:24:11.735]  I got it!
[00:24:11.735 --> 00:24:13.696]  Watch me!
[00:24:13.696 --> 00:24:14.597]  I got it!
[00:24:14.597 --> 00:24:15.137]  Hey!
[00:24:15.137 --> 00:24:24.382]  Well, it's so predictable that we're three plus weeks into this crisis.
[00:24:24.382 --> 00:24:25.903]  What, three weeks and five days?
[00:24:27.794 --> 00:24:39.644]  And the European Union, the US government, the Canadian government, they're all discussing because they don't want to scare the public and actually have people take precautions to protect themselves.
[00:24:39.644 --> 00:24:42.846]  And they're saying, well, we're just set to raise the safe levels.
[00:24:42.846 --> 00:24:50.553]  The EPA last week said, last Wednesday, yes, we found higher levels of radioactive isotopes in cow milk on the West Coast.
[00:24:52.592 --> 00:24:52.832]  I think?
[00:25:14.753 --> 00:25:18.415]  You stack enough pieces of paper on top of each other, you get a big pile.
[00:25:18.415 --> 00:25:20.176]  Well, it's the same thing with radiation.
[00:25:20.176 --> 00:25:31.422]  It starts to go up and up and up, and their response is, hey, now it's 7.5 million times normal levels of radiation dumping into the ocean.
[00:25:31.422 --> 00:25:31.882]  So what?
[00:25:31.882 --> 00:25:32.923]  It's not a problem.
[00:25:32.923 --> 00:25:35.944]  And the Japanese say they don't think it'll be a problem for seafood.
[00:25:35.944 --> 00:25:42.848]  And the only country, big country I've seen is India, saying we're banning everything from Japan that's produce coming into this nation.
[00:25:44.130 --> 00:25:46.152]  And they're on the other side of the world from the fallout.
[00:25:46.152 --> 00:25:49.935]  It's got to go all the way around the world before it gets back to there.
[00:25:49.935 --> 00:25:55.159]  Brandon Tuberville wrote a good article boiling us down with links to the mainstream news and EPA.
[00:25:55.159 --> 00:25:58.322]  America and EU raise radiation levels for food.
[00:25:58.322 --> 00:26:00.463]  This is on Infowars.com.
[00:26:00.463 --> 00:26:09.170]  On March 28, 2011, I wrote an article entitled, EPA to help mainstream media obscure the truth about radiation exposure to Americans, in which I discussed the
[00:26:10.091 --> 00:26:25.351]  Changes to the PAG's protective action guidelines being proposed by the EPA Environmental Protection Agency that would raise the acceptable levels of radiation allowed in the environment, food, and even the general public themselves in the event of a nuclear emergency.
[00:26:27.013 --> 00:26:41.743]  Interestingly enough, another article was published on April 3, 2011 by Alexander Higgins, citing KOPP Online and Xander News, stating that similar rule change was occurring in the European Union.
[00:26:42.605 --> 00:26:42.925]  Yeah.
[00:27:01.459 --> 00:27:03.380]  Yes, well the EPA is to raise acceptable radiation levels.
[00:27:26.075 --> 00:27:26.355]  I don't know.
[00:27:41.363 --> 00:27:52.069]  And it continues, no congressional approval is needed, is legally needed to make such changes because the EPA is a regulatory agency that sets policy.
[00:27:52.069 --> 00:27:55.731]  Kind of like they're shutting down coal-powered plants with no laws behind them.
[00:27:55.731 --> 00:27:58.993]  All of these types of agencies can be directed by Congress or the President.
[00:27:58.993 --> 00:28:00.774]  They often form their own policies.
[00:28:00.774 --> 00:28:08.338]  All that is required is that agencies such as the EPA wish to change their policy is that they first publish the proposed changes to the Federal Register
[00:28:08.638 --> 00:28:12.580]  For a designated public period or public comment time.
[00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:20.645]  However, since public opinion is worth virtually nothing, once the proposed change is published in the Federal Register, it is well on its way to becoming the new policy.
[00:28:20.645 --> 00:28:31.071]  This is the unfortunate to consider the fact that according to P.E.E.R., Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, the new standards will result in a nearly 1,000, here's the key,
[00:28:32.512 --> 00:28:42.674]  Nearly 1,000 fold increase for exposure to strontium-90 and 3,000 to 100,000 fold increase hike for exposure to iodine-131.
[00:28:42.674 --> 00:28:52.895]  So they're worried about it being so high that the proposed rules that we have links to, that they've entered this in the register, would be 3,000 to 100,000 time hike for iodine-131.
[00:28:52.895 --> 00:28:55.576]  That's what they're really picking up.
[00:28:55.576 --> 00:29:00.037]  And an almost 25,000 rise for exposure to radioactive nickel-63 in drinking water.
[00:29:02.759 --> 00:29:28.789]  Which brings us to the EU Mirror of EPA Policy, actually set back in 89 by amending standards in 87, and they are now announcing the EU Ordinance 297-2011 raises the maximum levels of radiation and radioactive isotopes for the food and feed to rather serious levels, including animal feed in some cases, such as cesium-134 and cesium-137.
[00:29:33.343 --> 00:29:37.506]  Uh, the levels are actually twice the amount of previously acceptable levels.
[00:29:37.506 --> 00:29:42.129]  Many of these increases are allowed in products such as infant formula and baby foods.
[00:29:42.129 --> 00:29:42.890]  And it just goes on.
[00:29:42.890 --> 00:29:50.515]  We'll continue along these lines, and we'll take your calls at 800-259-9231.
[00:29:50.515 --> 00:29:51.896]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.896 --> 00:29:54.438]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.438 --> 00:29:57.100]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.253 --> 00:30:04.454]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[00:30:04.454 --> 00:30:10.855]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[00:30:10.855 --> 00:30:18.236]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:30:18.236 --> 00:30:23.117]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:34.101]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[00:30:34.101 --> 00:30:34.421]  Call us!
[00:31:00.831 --> 00:31:15.256]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[00:31:16.297 --> 00:31:20.999]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.

[00:31:59.679 --> 00:32:04.221]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:32:04.221 --> 00:32:05.141]  Number 1.
[00:32:05.141 --> 00:32:08.563]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:32:08.563 --> 00:32:09.423]  Number 2.
[00:32:09.423 --> 00:32:14.305]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:32:14.305 --> 00:32:15.066]  It's true.
[00:32:15.066 --> 00:32:19.928]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:32:19.928 --> 00:32:20.748]  Number 3.
[00:32:20.748 --> 00:32:24.329]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:32:24.329 --> 00:32:28.031]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:32:28.251 --> 00:32:29.052]  Number 4.
[00:32:29.052 --> 00:32:31.794]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:32:31.794 --> 00:32:35.477]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:32:35.477 --> 00:32:36.277]  Number 5.
[00:32:36.277 --> 00:32:40.420]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:32:40.420 --> 00:32:45.184]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:07.622]  Government cover-ups.
[00:33:07.622 --> 00:33:08.943]  You want answers?
[00:33:08.943 --> 00:33:10.985]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:10.985 --> 00:33:14.968]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:14.968 --> 00:33:20.133]  What do you mean I don't believe in God?
[00:33:20.133 --> 00:33:22.335]  Talk to him every day.
[00:33:22.335 --> 00:33:26.799]  What do you mean I don't support your system?
[00:33:31.451 --> 00:33:42.617]  You know, I talked to Dave Mustaine a few weeks ago.
[00:33:42.617 --> 00:33:43.357]  He gave me a call.
[00:33:43.357 --> 00:33:46.779]  He said call him back the next week to get him back on the show.
[00:33:46.779 --> 00:33:47.519]  I never did it.
[00:33:47.519 --> 00:33:49.220]  I need to get around to that.
[00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:58.765]  In fact, today, guys, make me call Dave Mustaine of Megadeth, named his new album, Endgame, after our film Endgame, and help, helping spread the word about the New World Order.
[00:33:59.725 --> 00:34:03.309]  And he's since become a born-again Christian.
[00:34:03.309 --> 00:34:09.936]  I even had a chance to pray with him last year when he was in Dallas and invited me to an event up there.
[00:34:09.936 --> 00:34:14.101]  It's really great to see this show having that type of effect on people.
[00:34:17.357 --> 00:34:23.380]  It's interesting to see how many prominent people are really waking up to the New World Order.
[00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:33.926]  I want to go through a little bit more on these radiation headlines and the fact that in plain view the federal government is not giving us radiation numbers.
[00:34:33.926 --> 00:34:42.491]  State governments have quietly put out numbers of as high as 181 times safe levels of radioactive iodine and it's not getting
[00:34:43.527 --> 00:34:45.408]  Any of the attention it needs.
[00:34:45.408 --> 00:34:48.190]  How do we get the word out on this?
[00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:50.131]  I mean, sure, I do other radio interviews.
[00:34:50.131 --> 00:34:52.193]  I go on other TV programs.
[00:34:52.193 --> 00:34:54.474]  I try to bring these issues up.
[00:34:54.474 --> 00:34:57.576]  A lot of people don't want to know how serious this is.
[00:34:57.576 --> 00:35:00.578]  They just want to imagine that everything's going to be okay.
[00:35:02.025 --> 00:35:18.735]  Before we go back to the calls, it is your support of the sponsors of the show, our local AM and FM affiliate sponsors as well, that makes this broadcast possible and funds the news websites, the TV show, the radio show, and future films that we are producing.
[00:35:18.735 --> 00:35:20.356]  And we're also an information war.
[00:35:21.096 --> 00:35:41.484]  And when you get books like 63 Documents the Government Doesn't Want You to Read, that has gone as high as number two on Amazon now, and is climbing up the New York Times bestselling list, you get a tool that will inform you to a higher level, but also that you can then give to folks after you've read it, and pass on the information, and every mind we unlock is a great victory against the globalists.
[00:35:41.484 --> 00:35:46.606]  We're in a race against these people as they implode the world economy and try to offer their solution.
[00:35:47.666 --> 00:35:53.952]  of total world tyranny as the way out, as Ron Paul concurred yesterday.
[00:35:53.952 --> 00:35:57.275]  So, 63 documents the government doesn't want you to read.
[00:35:57.275 --> 00:36:08.665]  When you get it at Infowars.com with Big Brother, The Orwellian Nightmare Come True, Mark Dice's amazing new book, Illustrating the Parallels Between Modern Day and 1984.
[00:36:08.665 --> 00:36:09.646]  Very powerful read.
[00:36:09.646 --> 00:36:13.389]  When you get these two books together, already discounted, you can get
[00:36:13.949 --> 00:36:18.310]  One of my best-selling, most powerful films, free of your choice.
[00:36:18.310 --> 00:36:20.251]  DVDs with expanded extras.
[00:36:20.251 --> 00:36:26.493]  So a 1995 DVD, free when you get the two books at InfoWars.com.
[00:36:26.493 --> 00:36:30.274]  Also, we got a little bit more of these from him last week, but it's now out of print.
[00:36:31.127 --> 00:36:34.869]  It'll take him a few months to get them reprinted and back in stock.
[00:36:34.869 --> 00:36:38.350]  We do have a limited number of these because we ordered some more last week.
[00:36:38.350 --> 00:36:43.292]  The very last that he had, they came in and we now have them available.
[00:36:43.292 --> 00:36:49.554]  Strategic Relocation North American Guide to Safe Places 3rd Edition, Joel M. Skousen.
[00:36:49.554 --> 00:36:51.675]  I expect these to be sold out today.
[00:36:51.675 --> 00:36:54.816]  They are available for a limited time at InfoWars.com.
[00:36:57.754 --> 00:37:07.361]  Also, the V for Victory t-shirt, You Are The Resistance, is the best-selling t-shirt we've ever had, even better than the Obama Joker shirt that was a limited edition.
[00:37:07.361 --> 00:37:10.283]  The V for Victory is a limited edition as well.
[00:37:10.283 --> 00:37:17.948]  In fact, I'll just go ahead and make the announcement now that in three months we will not reorder these, even though it's our bestseller.
[00:37:17.948 --> 00:37:19.890]  They are limited edition and we will not offer the
[00:37:20.470 --> 00:37:23.354]  You are the Resistance V for Victory shirt again.
[00:37:23.354 --> 00:37:29.401]  We may come out with another variant but this particular shirt will be gone in three months or we'll stop ordering them in three months.
[00:37:29.401 --> 00:37:36.409]  So in three or four months they'll be gone if you want to get those because I did say when we launch them they'd be limited edition and they are.
[00:37:37.338 --> 00:37:39.339]  Many of our t-shirts are limited edition.
[00:37:39.339 --> 00:37:55.951]  And then, if you want to meet like-minded people, if you want to spread the word, if you want to be a walking billboard for liberty and the resistance and help expand the buzz for freedom and the fact that there are so many people that are awake and aware, get an InfoWars.com shirt.
[00:37:55.951 --> 00:37:58.753]  Get a In The Fed shirt with InfoWars.com on it.
[00:37:58.753 --> 00:38:00.614]  Get a draft Ron Paul 2012.
[00:38:00.614 --> 00:38:02.356]  By the way, he will be announcing
[00:38:02.936 --> 00:38:03.357]  I don't think so.
[00:38:22.054 --> 00:38:25.078]  I mean, you heard him pretty much say that yesterday here on air.
[00:38:25.078 --> 00:38:30.104]  So that limited edition shirt will not be available as soon as he announces.
[00:38:30.104 --> 00:38:34.009]  In fact, I'm already going to give the word today not to reorder any more of those when they sell out.
[00:38:34.009 --> 00:38:37.854]  That's it for the draft Ron Paul 2012 shirts that are quite handsome.
[00:38:38.695 --> 00:38:38.955]  I think?
[00:38:59.554 --> 00:39:12.182]  By 90 times, 3,000 to 100,000 fold for iodine-131, 25,000 or right at, right below 25,000 time increase for exposure to radioactive nickel-63.
[00:39:12.182 --> 00:39:16.585]  And that, of course, is the stuff showing up in the milk and food.
[00:39:16.585 --> 00:39:19.987]  So they just, again, just magically say it's safe.
[00:39:19.987 --> 00:39:22.689]  So it's safe, and they're not warning people.
[00:39:22.689 --> 00:39:26.551]  And I'm sorry for dairy producers on the West Coast.
[00:39:26.551 --> 00:39:28.413]  Of course, radiation's showing up all over the U.S.
[00:39:29.413 --> 00:39:32.777]  Uh, but I'm sorry for folks over there, but that's where most of the stuff is coming in.
[00:39:32.777 --> 00:39:44.027]  That's where the jet stream goes from a higher altitude and dumps in at the lower altitude, and that's where we predicted three weeks ago you'd see the first signs of this, and it's in the drinking water as well, and they're not telling people.
[00:39:45.305 --> 00:39:46.486]  Filter the water.
[00:39:46.486 --> 00:39:51.570]  They're not telling people get bottled water from out of state.
[00:39:51.570 --> 00:39:54.893]  They're not telling people or cities that they should be testing it further.
[00:39:54.893 --> 00:39:57.315]  They're not saying don't drink the milk.
[00:39:57.315 --> 00:40:00.098]  And I'm sorry for dairy producers on the West Coast, but I mean come on.
[00:40:01.220 --> 00:40:01.800]  Come on.
[00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:02.941]  The Feds aren't even testing it.
[00:40:02.941 --> 00:40:04.822]  The states have tested it and found higher levels.
[00:40:04.822 --> 00:40:09.425]  And they're now telling us they're just going to raise the levels and just forget about it.
[00:40:09.425 --> 00:40:13.228]  And people flying in from Japan to U.S.
[00:40:13.228 --> 00:40:19.892]  airports for two and a half weeks have been covered in radiation and they don't even take their shoes away from them that have the most of it on it.
[00:40:19.892 --> 00:40:21.614]  They just tell them go on into the U.S.
[00:40:21.614 --> 00:40:25.216]  So the policy is just don't worry about any of this.
[00:40:25.216 --> 00:40:30.720]  Toyota did last week come out and put out a little advisory to those that had just bought cars.
[00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:32.460]  Yeah, I think so.
[00:40:47.962 --> 00:40:51.766]  And how many apples go on your store shelves from California?
[00:40:51.766 --> 00:40:54.449]  How many strawberries?
[00:40:54.449 --> 00:40:55.670]  How much milk?
[00:40:55.670 --> 00:41:03.537]  I mean, there are literally hundreds of different produce products that come out of California that produces a lot of our food.
[00:41:03.537 --> 00:41:04.919]  A lot of really good food.
[00:41:04.919 --> 00:41:08.062]  Everything from artichokes to green beans to blueberries.
[00:41:08.062 --> 00:41:10.084]  I mean, you name it, it's grown there.
[00:41:10.084 --> 00:41:11.265]  Grapes.
[00:41:11.265 --> 00:41:11.765]  I mean, the list...
[00:41:12.788 --> 00:41:14.250]  It just goes on and on.
[00:41:14.250 --> 00:41:20.937]  Wine that's being picked right now, and people will be drinking this wine a couple of years from now.
[00:41:20.937 --> 00:41:25.602]  A lot of the radiation will break down by then, but it'll still have the toxic effects of these chemicals.
[00:41:27.296 --> 00:41:30.098]  It's basically immeasurable.
[00:41:30.098 --> 00:41:34.181]  As the Plant Radiation Monitor said today, that the levels are immeasurable.
[00:41:34.181 --> 00:41:40.585]  A radiation monitor in Troubled Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant says workers there are exposed to immeasurable levels of radiation.
[00:41:40.585 --> 00:41:51.252]  The monitor told NHK that no one can enter the plant's number one or three reactor buildings because radiation levels are so high that monitoring devices have been rendered useless.
[00:41:51.252 --> 00:41:52.753]  It's off the charts.
[00:41:52.753 --> 00:41:56.616]  But they're dumping into the ocean 7.5 million times at least safe levels.
[00:41:58.098 --> 00:42:02.088]  He said even levels outside the building exceed 100 millisieverts.
[00:42:03.625 --> 00:42:05.166]  And it continues.
[00:42:05.166 --> 00:42:12.392]  Pools and streams of water contaminated with highly radioactive isotopes are being found throughout the facility.
[00:42:12.392 --> 00:42:18.717]  The monitor says he takes measurements as soon as he finds water because he can't determine whether it's contaminated just by looking at it.
[00:42:18.717 --> 00:42:21.759]  He said he's very worried about the safety of the workers there.
[00:42:21.759 --> 00:42:25.462]  Contaminated water and efforts to remove it have been hampered.
[00:42:25.462 --> 00:42:27.984]  Much needed work to cool the reactors.
[00:42:27.984 --> 00:42:31.047]  The monitor expressed frustration linking the situation to looking up
[00:42:31.767 --> 00:42:36.429]  Mountains that one has to climb without having taken a single step.
[00:42:36.429 --> 00:42:39.130]  It's just that high.
[00:42:39.130 --> 00:42:41.491]  Here's another New York Times article.
[00:42:41.491 --> 00:42:41.771]  U.S.
[00:42:41.771 --> 00:42:45.312]  sees array of new threats at Japan's nuclear plant.
[00:42:45.312 --> 00:42:55.176]  Continued meltdowns, explosions, unable to plug all the different leaks from the explosions because you've got pipes going into the containment areas, breach containment.
[00:42:55.176 --> 00:42:57.337]  It just goes on and on.
[00:42:59.816 --> 00:43:04.358]  And the likelihood of more explosions, they report on that.
[00:43:04.358 --> 00:43:08.179]  Japan has plugged one uncontrolled leak from the nuclear plant for now.
[00:43:08.179 --> 00:43:10.260]  That's some good news out of AFP.
[00:43:10.260 --> 00:43:14.581]  TEPCO to inject nitrogen into number one reactor to prevent explosion.
[00:43:14.581 --> 00:43:16.702]  That's Japan today.
[00:43:16.702 --> 00:43:18.842]  That's just some of what we have there.
[00:43:18.842 --> 00:43:23.044]  Okay, I'm gonna go to your calls now for the balance of the hour.
[00:43:24.793 --> 00:43:38.315]  And then Lindsey Williams is going to be joining us because of course he said six months ago, October 22nd here, that his inside sources would, that there was going to be destabilization in the Middle East.
[00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:39.640]  Today is
[00:43:59.070 --> 00:44:09.559]  According to top analyst, oil prices could rocket 200-300 a barrel if the world's top crude exporter, Saudi Arabia, is hit by serious political unrest, former Saudi oil minister told Reuters.
[00:44:09.559 --> 00:44:12.562]  And they've got other analysts basically saying the same thing.
[00:44:12.562 --> 00:44:18.067]  Also, Ron Paul announces that he will be saying he's going to run or not run in the next month.
[00:44:18.067 --> 00:44:22.151]  Here on air yesterday that got picked up by Politico, USA Today.
[00:44:22.951 --> 00:44:24.573]  Thank you for taking my call, sir.
[00:44:24.573 --> 00:44:25.674]  It's a pleasure to speak with you.
[00:44:46.335 --> 00:44:51.780]  I just had a question regarding a court case that began yesterday involving 9-11.
[00:44:51.780 --> 00:44:58.867]  You had spoken to a young lady named April Gallup back in 2008 regarding her account as what happened at the Pentagon.
[00:44:58.867 --> 00:45:04.912]  Yeah, she was one of the only survivors where the missile hit at the Pentagon.
[00:45:04.912 --> 00:45:06.594]  Yes, that's correct.
[00:45:06.594 --> 00:45:10.898]  I just was wondering if you had any general comments on the court case, if you have spoken to Ms.
[00:45:10.898 --> 00:45:11.719]  Gallup since then?
[00:45:13.937 --> 00:45:16.679]  No, but it would be good to get her on.
[00:45:16.679 --> 00:45:23.685]  I know we've had some of her associates on since then, but April Gallup is a good person to get back on.
[00:45:23.685 --> 00:45:25.307]  Okay, and one other question.
[00:45:25.307 --> 00:45:29.250]  In the suit, it's Gallup versus Cheney for Roosevelt and Myers.
[00:45:29.250 --> 00:45:35.395]  Why wasn't President Bush, and for that matter, the majority of his administration included in the suit?
[00:45:35.395 --> 00:45:38.798]  Because most of the experts who've really studied it, including myself,
[00:45:39.779 --> 00:45:43.140]  It looks like Bush was running around scared and was out of the lube.
[00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:51.844]  Cheney was in command of the operation in the bunker, according to Norman Mineta and others.
[00:45:51.844 --> 00:46:04.249]  And we have the stand-down order from June of that year taking the default power for brass to shoot down hijacked aircraft that were going to be used as weapons or that were going to crash into populated areas.
[00:46:04.249 --> 00:46:05.810]  So you also have that.
[00:46:05.810 --> 00:46:08.311]  They then rescinded that stand-down order a week after 9-11.
[00:46:10.546 --> 00:46:11.567]  Okay.
[00:46:11.567 --> 00:46:14.009]  And just one follow-up thing on the article I originally read.
[00:46:14.009 --> 00:46:16.131]  It was on 911truth.org.
[00:46:16.131 --> 00:46:25.440]  As of that article being published on March 24, I have not seen anything in mainstream media or even local news in New Haven, Connecticut, addressing the court case.
[00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:27.723]  Is that deliberate that they're not speaking about it?
[00:46:28.667 --> 00:46:29.407]  Absolutely.
[00:46:29.407 --> 00:46:33.169]  They don't want a survivor who had her baby there that day.
[00:46:33.169 --> 00:46:46.913]  You know, they let them have their baby a couple days a year come, your children, with secretaries and she barely survived and was basically told to shut up and it's a key piece of testimony and we're going to work on getting her on.
[00:46:46.913 --> 00:46:49.274]  The producers are listening and I give the green light to that.
[00:46:49.274 --> 00:46:50.474]  Thank you, Adam.
[00:46:50.474 --> 00:46:52.675]  I'm happy to take Adam's question because we're open phones.
[00:46:52.675 --> 00:46:54.756]  Does anybody want to talk about the cover-up of the radiation?
[00:46:55.745 --> 00:46:59.208]  And the media and the government saying they're going to raise safe levels.
[00:46:59.208 --> 00:47:01.169]  I mean, I'm not scolding you.
[00:47:01.169 --> 00:47:02.090]  I'm glad you brought that up.
[00:47:02.090 --> 00:47:08.115]  But I hope somebody is concerned about this radiation and the fact that the government's covering this up.
[00:47:08.115 --> 00:47:09.436]  Let's go to Richard in Vermont.
[00:47:09.436 --> 00:47:11.477]  Richard, you're on the air.
[00:47:11.477 --> 00:47:12.118]  Hi, Alex.
[00:47:12.118 --> 00:47:12.858]  How are you doing?
[00:47:12.858 --> 00:47:13.979]  Good.
[00:47:13.979 --> 00:47:15.260]  OK.
[00:47:15.260 --> 00:47:24.888]  In the New York Times, in the Asia Pacific section from yesterday's paper, article by James Glantz and
[00:47:25.919 --> 00:47:28.401]  William J. Broad, from April 5th.
[00:47:28.401 --> 00:47:30.682]  The name of the article is, U.S.
[00:47:30.682 --> 00:47:34.805]  Sees Array of New Threats at Japan's Nuclear Plant.
[00:47:34.805 --> 00:47:36.686]  Yeah, I just mentioned that, yeah.
[00:47:36.686 --> 00:47:46.253]  Okay, and... They don't get to... This is one of those footnote things that they just happen to throw in their seventh paragraph down.
[00:47:47.481 --> 00:47:58.209]  Okay, now when you and I saw that, I actually was the guy that called you and told you that they had blown plutonium rods all over the place after we were trying to figure out what was coming out of that 3,000 foot cloud.
[00:47:58.209 --> 00:48:00.391]  That's right, you're a former nuclear worker.
[00:48:00.391 --> 00:48:01.972]  You've called before, right?
[00:48:01.972 --> 00:48:03.253]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:48:03.253 --> 00:48:09.078]  Okay, down in regards to three weeks and four days ago when I called,
[00:48:09.926 --> 00:48:12.887]  You and I were sure that we saw stuff getting flying out of that.
[00:48:12.887 --> 00:48:19.130]  Well, they admit they were storing 644,000 rods on top of these facilities, and it was clearly rods.
[00:48:19.130 --> 00:48:22.992]  I said that the day I saw it, that Monday, you know, three days into the event.
[00:48:22.992 --> 00:48:25.373]  I said, looks like fuel rods, and it turns out here it is.
[00:48:25.373 --> 00:48:32.757]  The document also suggests that fragments or particles of nuclear fuel from spent fuel rods above the reactors were blown up to one mile
[00:48:33.097 --> 00:48:41.382]  Yep, and the pieces of highly reactive or radioactive material fell between two of the units, which doesn't that make it a nice cozy little place in there between two of the units?
[00:48:41.382 --> 00:48:42.683]  We know for a fact that it had blown
[00:48:59.932 --> 00:49:10.777]  Within a mile, and I don't know if you recall or if you ever saw one of the examples that they give on how radiation spreads.
[00:49:10.777 --> 00:49:18.600]  They put a room full of mousetraps and they have a ping pong ball set on instead of a piece of cheese on each one of those.
[00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:28.304]  And they take one ping pong ball and they throw it into the middle of the room and within a matter of seconds all the rest of the mousetraps in the room all
[00:49:28.956 --> 00:49:32.537]  Fire off and the ping pong balls are flying all over the place.
[00:49:32.537 --> 00:49:40.338]  Well, what happens when that stuff hits this, when particularly plutonium, uh, plutonium isotopes hit the soil?
[00:49:40.338 --> 00:49:43.179]  All right, now this is spread around within a mile.
[00:49:43.179 --> 00:49:44.119]  Those things spread.
[00:49:44.119 --> 00:49:51.260]  Each molecule of dirt spreads it onto the next molecule of dirt and it just starts spreading out farther and farther.
[00:49:51.260 --> 00:49:56.401]  And for them to pull those over these things, it's like having a field of landmines.
[00:49:56.977 --> 00:49:58.358]  And you don't even have to step on something.
[00:49:58.358 --> 00:49:59.018]  Well, sure.
[00:49:59.018 --> 00:50:11.122]  I mean, for billions of years, the radioactive half-life of uranium is four and a half bill on average, depending on the variant of it, from what we've seen and the physicists we've had on.
[00:50:11.122 --> 00:50:15.364]  And it's going to be leaching into the soil, the water table, the ocean.
[00:50:15.364 --> 00:50:20.525]  And that's what we said when number one blew up on Saturday.
[00:50:20.525 --> 00:50:21.986]  We wrote an article, Curt Nemo did.
[00:50:23.483 --> 00:50:30.905]  Uh, and then we linked to other articles that Drudge picked up, uh, from some of our auxiliary writers, where we said, looks like fuel rods were blown sky-high.
[00:50:30.905 --> 00:50:33.345]  I'm not bragging, it's just, we don't make stuff up here.
[00:50:33.345 --> 00:50:38.546]  And then, Monday, the Mach 3, uh, number 3 blew sky-high.
[00:50:38.546 --> 00:50:42.367]  And, I mean, clearly, that damaged the core, and later they admitted, yeah, it damaged the core.
[00:50:42.367 --> 00:50:44.067]  That explosion looked like a nuke went off.
[00:50:44.067 --> 00:50:46.688]  I mean, of course it damaged the core.
[00:50:46.688 --> 00:50:49.088]  Uh, and, and this stuff is spreading, it's terrible.
[00:50:49.088 --> 00:50:51.429]  Richard, uh, you want to add anything else after the break, or are you done?
[00:50:52.798 --> 00:50:53.239]  Uh, no.
[00:50:53.239 --> 00:50:54.103]  Go ahead and go to your break.
[00:50:54.103 --> 00:50:54.986]  Yeah, I'm pretty well done.
[00:50:54.986 --> 00:50:56.050]  Alright, God bless you.
[00:50:56.050 --> 00:50:57.134]  And you were absolutely right, sir.
[00:51:00.359 --> 00:51:02.180]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:51:02.180 --> 00:51:17.731]  The earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear disaster that killed thousands of Japanese citizens is nothing compared to the devastation that could be caused by hyperinflation that will soon hit the United States and could lead to millions of Americans becoming homeless, all caused by the devalued U.S.
[00:51:17.731 --> 00:51:18.071]  dollar.
[00:51:18.071 --> 00:51:26.217]  While the mainstream media continues to ignore inflation, our friends at the National Inflation Association provide a free weekly newsletter that educates Americans of the
[00:51:26.497 --> 00:51:26.918]  I think so.

[00:54:18.672 --> 00:54:20.254]  Maybe a bad bad thing.
[00:54:20.254 --> 00:54:22.858]  Maybe a bad bad thing.
[00:54:29.738 --> 00:54:31.060]  They did a bad, bad thing.
[00:54:31.060 --> 00:54:40.051]  They're dumping 7.5 million times safe levels of cocktail of radioactive poisons into the Pacific Ocean.
[00:54:40.051 --> 00:54:47.961]  This New York Times article does have buried that the government and Japanese report says that they did spray fuel rods everywhere, that they're just bulldozing.
[00:54:48.582 --> 00:54:50.705]  Upwards of a mile away, not even picking them up.
[00:54:50.705 --> 00:54:52.366]  They're just burying them on the spot.
[00:54:52.366 --> 00:54:53.708]  I mean, this is insane.
[00:54:53.708 --> 00:54:55.150]  Not even marking where they're at.
[00:54:55.150 --> 00:54:59.595]  This just shows the ham-fisted, not caring attitude of these people.
[00:54:59.595 --> 00:55:00.376]  And why not?
[00:55:00.376 --> 00:55:02.678]  They can just say, radiation's now good for you.
[00:55:02.678 --> 00:55:03.079]  And raise it.
[00:55:04.340 --> 00:55:08.586]  25,000 times with one isotope, 10,000 times with another, and that's all in the news.
[00:55:08.586 --> 00:55:15.314]  The EPA just calmly reporting it like it's no big deal, and then we're the alarmist conspiracy theorists for being concerned.
[00:55:15.314 --> 00:55:20.741]  Later in the third hour, I'll talk about this a little bit, but I want to go to your calls right now, and then Lindsey Williams at 8 after.
[00:55:21.542 --> 00:55:25.944]  We'll get Lindsey on at 8 after the second segment so I can finish up with these callers.
[00:55:25.944 --> 00:55:32.287]  The Huffington Post is reporting and we'll get a link to this up on InfoWars.com right now.
[00:55:32.287 --> 00:55:34.428]  The best place to find it is up at the Drudge Report right now.
[00:55:34.428 --> 00:55:38.630]  It's the top link, big headline, back out at Fox.
[00:55:38.630 --> 00:55:40.711]  And this is exactly how I predicted they would do it.
[00:55:42.112 --> 00:55:44.895]  It's like when they took Gibson.
[00:55:44.895 --> 00:55:46.537]  I've been a guest on his show and his radio show.
[00:55:46.537 --> 00:55:49.620]  When they took Gibson, New York Times also has it.
[00:55:49.620 --> 00:55:52.103]  Back to in daily Fox News program.
[00:55:53.186 --> 00:55:53.406]  I think?
[00:56:12.468 --> 00:56:40.228]  uh... that he does specials and as a contributor to some of the shows and so uh... he said on his radio program today that uh... they are phasing that he's being phased out and transitioned off fox now i have three sources inside fox i was going to leave it at that and i knew over a month and a half ago that the word was that the only person keeping back there was roger ailes and that it was being looked at the back would be gone and that
[00:56:41.792 --> 00:56:48.273]  His ratings had dropped by about 35% in the last year and were continuing in free fall.
[00:56:48.273 --> 00:56:51.814]  Then last week the numbers came out that he fell even more on TV.
[00:56:51.814 --> 00:56:59.676]  Still 2 million viewers, still more than CNN and MSNBC combined, but they're bigger shows.
[00:56:59.676 --> 00:57:03.877]  The real reason he's being run out of Fox is the fact that
[00:57:05.123 --> 00:57:14.069]  Media Matters, George Soros funded, took and brags that they basically were instrumental in running off 400 plus sponsors.
[00:57:14.069 --> 00:57:22.055]  And now the memos have been released two weeks ago out of Politico that Media Matters job is to sabotage and destroy Fox, period.
[00:57:22.055 --> 00:57:27.559]  So I think Fox has made a big mistake here because now they're just going to turn their guns on Hannity and others.
[00:57:27.559 --> 00:57:33.023]  And even though I don't particularly like these guys as phony conservatives, it's it's they're better than George Soros.
[00:57:33.283 --> 00:57:39.008]  Any day of the week, they'll at least be pro-gun and talk about cutting taxes.
[00:57:39.008 --> 00:57:41.350]  And Beck would talk about the Federal Reserve and the New World Order.
[00:57:41.350 --> 00:57:42.451]  He was a lot better than them.
[00:57:42.451 --> 00:57:57.484]  I would have loved to be able to support Beck as a lesser of evils compared to something like MSNBC, but he privately did stuff to mess with my show and to keep people off as guests and threaten and try to keep me off Fox News.
[00:57:59.168 --> 00:58:03.598]  And so it's infuriating.
[00:58:03.598 --> 00:58:04.861]  But I'm not happy about this.
[00:58:06.397 --> 00:58:08.337]  He's gained 88 stations in the last year.
[00:58:08.337 --> 00:58:11.218]  The media says, ooh, he's lost seven, like he's losing affiliates.
[00:58:11.218 --> 00:58:12.798]  You always lose and gain affiliates.
[00:58:12.798 --> 00:58:14.119]  They change formats.
[00:58:14.119 --> 00:58:15.859]  Program directors have new ideas.
[00:58:15.859 --> 00:58:17.179]  His show's growing.
[00:58:17.179 --> 00:58:18.680]  He's doing better in radio than ever.
[00:58:18.680 --> 00:58:20.540]  And that's where his big audience is.
[00:58:20.540 --> 00:58:22.540]  He's only got 2 million on Fox.
[00:58:22.540 --> 00:58:26.961]  He's got about 6, 7 million a day, over 11 million a week.
[00:58:26.961 --> 00:58:33.883]  And though I find him disingenuous and distasteful and very deceptive towards myself, playing edited tapes of me and things on air,
[00:58:35.843 --> 00:58:37.526]  Still, this is not good.
[00:58:37.526 --> 00:58:43.914]  This is not good news.
[00:58:43.914 --> 00:58:47.880]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:50.253 --> 00:58:54.075]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot movement.
[00:58:54.075 --> 00:58:58.377]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[00:58:58.377 --> 00:59:03.460]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[00:59:03.460 --> 00:59:09.023]  I'm looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[00:59:09.023 --> 00:59:12.264]  Not worried about them moving south.
[00:59:12.264 --> 00:59:16.046]  Closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[00:59:18.798 --> 00:59:24.325]  I'm looking for America.
[00:59:24.325 --> 00:59:25.967]  We're American and be proud.

[01:00:00.895 --> 01:00:01.655]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.326 --> 01:00:08.108]  Mainstream media.

[01:00:11.450 --> 01:00:12.351]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.351 --> 01:00:17.195]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.195 --> 01:00:25.002]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:25.002 --> 01:00:26.243]  We are back live.
[01:00:26.243 --> 01:00:30.866]  Pastor Lindsey Williams, certainly proven right yet again six months ago inside sources.
[01:00:32.008 --> 01:00:44.853]  Big Oil Company execs told him that they were going to stage events in the Middle East to create a crisis, that oil prices would go in the next six months to a year from $65 a barrel to $150 and then as high as $200 a barrel.
[01:00:44.853 --> 01:00:47.794]  Brent crude's now at $122 today.
[01:00:47.794 --> 01:00:50.035]  Gold going towards all-time high.
[01:00:50.035 --> 01:00:52.015]  Headline Bloomberg Financial.
[01:00:52.015 --> 01:00:54.496]  Gold advances to record for second day.
[01:00:54.496 --> 01:00:55.137]  Silver at 31-year high.
[01:00:57.261 --> 01:00:59.162]  We're going to be breaking that down as well.
[01:00:59.162 --> 01:01:04.326]  I want to continue now with some of your phone calls here with Jason in Florida.
[01:01:04.326 --> 01:01:05.808]  Jason, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:01:05.808 --> 01:01:08.209]  Hi, Alex.
[01:01:08.209 --> 01:01:09.330]  Keep up the good work.
[01:01:09.330 --> 01:01:13.734]  I appreciate everything you're doing, but I have a couple questions, actually.
[01:01:13.734 --> 01:01:25.403]  I'm in the military, and I keep trying to tell these guys about radiation poisoning and everything like that because we're actually a squadron, our sister squadron, has gone to Japan, and everyone thinks it's a joke.
[01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:31.102]  Really, the aircraft carriers ran out of the area and they've been evacuating U.S.
[01:01:31.102 --> 01:01:32.342]  troops all the way to the south.
[01:01:32.342 --> 01:01:35.943]  I mean, that's been on record for two weeks, but your guys think it's a joke?
[01:01:35.943 --> 01:01:40.585]  Yeah, everyone's laughing about it, saying, oh, radiation, that's not going to affect us.
[01:01:40.585 --> 01:01:42.086]  And I keep telling them, but...
[01:01:43.524 --> 01:01:43.864]  Yeah, I don't know.
[01:02:12.990 --> 01:02:20.476]  I was wondering, I've been trying to look on Google and everything, Dex, you said the state's been putting out radiation levels and I haven't found anything on Florida.
[01:02:20.476 --> 01:02:22.758]  Do you know anything if they're finding radiation?
[01:02:22.758 --> 01:02:30.043]  No, I've seen it in more than 20 states, Massachusetts, California, Nevada.
[01:02:30.043 --> 01:02:36.068]  Just put the name of your Florida, Florida reports minuscule or low level increase.
[01:02:36.068 --> 01:02:37.009]  That's usually the spin.
[01:02:37.009 --> 01:02:39.371]  I haven't seen them report that in Florida, but I've seen it.
[01:02:40.171 --> 01:02:45.533]  In more than 20 states, just minor footnotes, that, oh by the way, there's some increased radiation.
[01:02:45.533 --> 01:02:46.513]  It's safe.
[01:02:46.513 --> 01:02:52.655]  And now that it's going up levels that aren't safe according to their old measurement, they just say, well, we're raising what's safe then.
[01:02:52.655 --> 01:02:59.677]  So, uh, I mean, if the government comes out and says cyanide's safe to eat, I wouldn't eat it.
[01:02:59.677 --> 01:03:01.037]  See what I'm saying?
[01:03:01.037 --> 01:03:06.859]  Yeah, because, um, well, it's just, it's just really frustrating, Alex, because I'm trying to, you know, open these guys' eyes up, because
[01:03:07.481 --> 01:03:22.124]  It's actually, you know, talking about the tough guy thing, um, when I was talking about Libya and all the things that were going on in Libya, and I was actually showing these guys reports directly from, you know, MSNBC, CNN, all this stuff about, you know, them using DU bombs and everything like that.
[01:03:22.124 --> 01:03:31.986]  And everyone's calling me, you know, I'm a, you know, I'm scared, you know, I'm a, I'm a, um, you know, I'm a hippie, I'm against, you know, the military, I'm not a hard ass, you know, all that good stuff like that.
[01:03:31.986 --> 01:03:34.046]  And they don't understand that.
[01:03:34.468 --> 01:03:35.029]  We're good to go.
[01:03:49.147 --> 01:04:01.013]  In the last few weeks, seeing a lot of former military people on the news saying it's a bad idea and hearing current military calling in saying that the mission's not defined and that they're backing Al Qaeda and that's wrong.
[01:04:01.013 --> 01:04:04.635]  And a lot of congressmen and people have talked about it.
[01:04:04.635 --> 01:04:08.257]  Even the Secretary of Defense three weeks ago said he didn't think it was a very good idea.
[01:04:08.257 --> 01:04:12.880]  So, sounds like some of the guys in your, you say in your squadron, are you in the Air Force?
[01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:14.941]  No sir, I'm in the Navy.
[01:04:16.445 --> 01:04:19.646]  Okay, so they're not concerned.
[01:04:19.646 --> 01:04:21.126]  Well, I don't know what to say.
[01:04:21.126 --> 01:04:27.407]  I mean, I always thought it was important and intelligent to be concerned and to weigh things and to discuss things.
[01:04:27.407 --> 01:04:30.948]  It doesn't mean you don't follow orders as long as they're lawful orders.
[01:04:30.948 --> 01:04:35.629]  But to talk about radiation concerns doesn't mean you're a wimp.
[01:04:35.629 --> 01:04:37.029]  I mean, that's bizarre.
[01:04:37.029 --> 01:04:39.410]  But unfortunately, they'll find out.
[01:04:39.410 --> 01:04:42.311]  People think they can smoke a pack of cigarettes a day and get away with it.
[01:04:42.311 --> 01:04:43.991]  On average, take about 20 years off your life.
[01:04:45.846 --> 01:04:47.949]  It just shows people think they're bulletproof.
[01:04:47.949 --> 01:04:54.157]  But let me tell you, time has a way of showing folks that they weren't bulletproof.
[01:04:54.157 --> 01:04:55.359]  That's the foolishness of youth.
[01:04:55.359 --> 01:04:58.904]  A lot of good things come with youth, but also a lot of bad things.
[01:05:00.655 --> 01:05:04.238]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[01:05:04.238 --> 01:05:05.539]  It ended on June of 2009.
[01:05:05.539 --> 01:05:09.942]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[01:05:09.942 --> 01:05:15.886]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[01:05:15.886 --> 01:05:18.028]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[01:05:18.028 --> 01:05:20.710]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[01:05:21.050 --> 01:05:27.555]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[01:05:27.555 --> 01:05:29.776]  They both make fabulous investments.
[01:05:29.776 --> 01:05:35.100]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[01:05:35.100 --> 01:05:40.403]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[01:05:40.403 --> 01:05:45.767]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long-term.
[01:05:45.767 --> 01:05:47.108]  This will freeze the cost of your
[01:05:47.108 --> 01:05:47.468]  We're good.
[01:06:04.191 --> 01:06:05.451]  Tyranny is here.
[01:06:05.451 --> 01:06:09.312]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:06:09.312 --> 01:06:11.613]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:06:11.613 --> 01:06:17.474]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:06:17.474 --> 01:06:23.716]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:06:24.136 --> 01:06:30.101]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:06:30.101 --> 01:06:34.305]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:06:34.305 --> 01:06:38.609]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:06:38.609 --> 01:06:44.554]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[01:06:44.554 --> 01:06:48.117]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:06:48.117 --> 01:06:50.078]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:06:50.078 --> 01:06:50.519]  It's here.

[01:07:52.378 --> 01:07:53.199]  Thank you!
[01:08:01.798 --> 01:08:08.430]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:08.430 --> 01:08:11.416]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:15.811 --> 01:08:19.093]  For the next hour, Pastor Lindsey Williams is our guest.
[01:08:19.093 --> 01:08:21.835]  In fact, five minutes into the next hour, we're gonna open the phones up.
[01:08:21.835 --> 01:08:34.043]  I know we have callers that were previously holding, but if you, I'm sorry we didn't get to all of you, but if you have a question for Lindsey Williams about the Middle East, about commodity and oil prices increasing, you're welcome to stay.
[01:08:34.043 --> 01:08:38.306]  If not, I'd ask you to please disconnect so others can call in at 1-800-259-9231 and you'll be welcome
[01:08:42.449 --> 01:08:47.271]  To call back in in the third hour when we have open phones for everybody and go through a lot of important news.
[01:08:47.271 --> 01:08:58.815]  Pastor Lindsey Williams, going back three years ago plus, said oil will go from $60 a barrel to $150 in the next six months.
[01:08:58.815 --> 01:09:00.876]  Everybody laughed at him but me.
[01:09:00.876 --> 01:09:05.278]  It went up to $150, then he said, now it's gonna go down to $40.
[01:09:05.278 --> 01:09:06.238]  Everybody laughed again.
[01:09:06.238 --> 01:09:10.600]  It went down to $40, exactly as he said, on the exact same time frame.
[01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:15.862]  Uh, and he then said two years ago, he said, enjoy yourself.
[01:09:15.862 --> 01:09:19.503]  It's going to stay at 60 or thereabouts for two years.
[01:09:19.503 --> 01:09:26.766]  Uh, but then when it starts going back up, uh, it will then race up to 150 or higher, perhaps 200.
[01:09:26.766 --> 01:09:33.949]  Now he wasn't looking into tea leaves or runes or a crystal ball at a roadside gypsy shack.
[01:09:35.549 --> 01:09:39.952]  He wasn't consulting the Easter Bunny or doing seances.
[01:09:39.952 --> 01:09:42.094]  He worked as the head chaplain.
[01:09:42.094 --> 01:09:45.836]  That's a key position just like in Congress or just like on an aircraft carrier.
[01:09:45.836 --> 01:09:50.179]  The chaplain's the only person that can walk in and talk to the admiral or the captain whenever they want.
[01:09:50.179 --> 01:09:53.361]  It's a liaison to the men throughout history.
[01:09:53.361 --> 01:09:58.384]  He was out there running his own charter company of aircraft on the side preaching.
[01:09:58.384 --> 01:09:58.985]  They liked him.
[01:09:59.997 --> 01:10:07.241]  Brought him up to the, you know, what they called the Atlantic Richfield Hilton, their own private hotel for the elites.
[01:10:07.241 --> 01:10:21.710]  Put him in there for years, and he became the chaplain and sat in on inter-oil company board meetings as the liaison to the work crews, because he decreased the prostitution, the alcoholism, the fighting.
[01:10:21.710 --> 01:10:22.311]  He was their guy.
[01:10:24.148 --> 01:10:29.750]  And he wrote a book, Energy Non-Crisis, how there was more oil in Alaska discovered than Saudi Arabia and how they wouldn't release it.
[01:10:29.750 --> 01:10:31.371]  Now that's been declassified.
[01:10:31.371 --> 01:10:34.292]  When he wrote it back in the 1980s, he was laughed at.
[01:10:34.292 --> 01:10:37.473]  It's all confirmed now.
[01:10:37.473 --> 01:10:47.217]  He wrote about the deal they'd done with the Arabs to have them invest all of their, most of their money in T-bills.
[01:10:47.217 --> 01:10:53.240]  And in turn, the US would keep most of the oil out of the Gulf and out of Alaska.
[01:10:54.312 --> 01:10:54.472]  I think
[01:11:18.766 --> 01:11:23.248]  Federal Reserve documents that most of the trillions went to foreign banks and to private corporations.
[01:11:23.248 --> 01:11:45.461]  Same thing, AP sued, we wrote big articles about it at the time, and then again in 2006 when more came out, that the oil companies got together in 95 and 96, the big ten at meetings, and there's the minutes of the meetings, and we linked to those in the articles, and AP, again, are the ones that got them, and it was how they met and said there's too much oil, we've already shut down most of the fields in areas we don't control using government,
[01:11:47.062 --> 01:11:49.606]  To create artificial scarcity, we need...
[01:11:50.649 --> 01:11:57.872]  To buy up all of the existing refineries that we don't own, and shut them down, and not expand our refineries.
[01:11:57.872 --> 01:11:59.753]  That's how we're going to create an artificial bottleneck.
[01:11:59.753 --> 01:12:01.474]  So, there's another confirmed.
[01:12:01.474 --> 01:12:02.074]  How they're doing it.
[01:12:02.074 --> 01:12:05.135]  The oil companies don't want you to get the oil.
[01:12:05.135 --> 01:12:09.037]  Just like diamonds are only semi-precious, but they're geographically located.
[01:12:09.037 --> 01:12:14.059]  So, the De Beers is able, on record, to shut them down and have a 90 plus percent diamond monopoly.
[01:12:14.059 --> 01:12:17.760]  So, a diamond that should cost $5, they lay on the ground in Africa.
[01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:18.301]  You know, costs $10,000.
[01:12:20.275 --> 01:12:21.575]  On the scale, they're semi-precious.
[01:12:21.575 --> 01:12:22.696]  It's a giant scam.
[01:12:22.696 --> 01:12:24.816]  Same thing with oil.
[01:12:24.816 --> 01:12:38.579]  And Lindsey then came on here six months ago, October 22nd, and he said, and I'm just building this up so new listeners understand why this is important, and Ken Fromm was nearing death.
[01:12:38.579 --> 01:12:42.880]  And so he went ahead and revealed Ken Fromm because then he was allowed to.
[01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:46.100]  And then Ken Fromm did die in December of cancer, long battle.
[01:12:46.100 --> 01:12:48.501]  Ken Fromm was the operations director at No.
[01:12:48.501 --> 01:12:49.221]  2 Atlantic Richfield.
[01:12:50.165 --> 01:12:52.772]  But not his main source, just one of his big ones.
[01:12:52.772 --> 01:12:55.178]  The other guy is the former CEO of the Big Three.
[01:12:55.178 --> 01:12:57.022]  I know his name, not allowed to say.
[01:12:58.696 --> 01:13:00.097]  And obviously, it's a source.
[01:13:00.097 --> 01:13:00.997]  That's how the media works.
[01:13:00.997 --> 01:13:02.398]  I get emails going, why can't you tell us?
[01:13:02.398 --> 01:13:17.163]  Well, that's how, when Homeland Security people, federal marshals send me internal documents, how Homeland Security is really for the American people, and it goes into 500 newspapers the next day, and then they're saying, tell us your source, they would be fired if I told you the source.
[01:13:17.163 --> 01:13:18.524]  That's how media works.
[01:13:18.524 --> 01:13:19.745]  It's called sources.
[01:13:19.745 --> 01:13:24.767]  Now, this other source, we can't reveal, we have revealed the other one, because he's dead now.
[01:13:28.991 --> 01:13:30.312]  They both told him.
[01:13:30.312 --> 01:13:31.052]  In October.
[01:13:31.052 --> 01:13:36.155]  Because he talked to Fromm, and then he called the other guy, and he said, yeah, that's right, and let me tell you more.
[01:13:36.155 --> 01:13:37.475]  You're going to see destabilization.
[01:13:37.475 --> 01:13:38.075]  He said war?
[01:13:38.075 --> 01:13:38.736]  He said no.
[01:13:38.736 --> 01:13:40.897]  Crises in the Middle East.
[01:13:40.897 --> 01:13:42.097]  That's going to run oil up.
[01:13:42.097 --> 01:13:43.418]  We're behind it to 150.
[01:13:43.418 --> 01:13:48.480]  Then we're going to use that to decouple the dollar and to start the slide of the dollar.
[01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:51.202]  The Arabs will be double-crossed because they've invested in the dollar.
[01:13:51.202 --> 01:13:53.383]  And then we'll open up drilling all over North America.
[01:13:55.745 --> 01:13:57.287]  But that'll take years to go online.
[01:13:57.287 --> 01:13:58.748]  In that interim, oil will go to 150 to 200.
[01:13:58.748 --> 01:13:59.529]  Well, Reuters yesterday reports...
[01:14:04.764 --> 01:14:05.044]  Thank you.
[01:14:26.875 --> 01:14:40.768]  Alex Jones, I want to congratulate you for being such a brave talk show host to allow me to appear on InfoWars over the years and say such nearly unbelievable things that my latest friends have told me.
[01:14:40.768 --> 01:14:43.710]  I admire you more than you can possibly imagine.
[01:14:43.710 --> 01:14:46.653]  There were other talk show hosts that wouldn't even allow me on the air.
[01:14:46.653 --> 01:14:48.354]  Many of them laughed at me.
[01:14:48.354 --> 01:14:49.716]  You took me on as a friend.
[01:14:50.636 --> 01:14:57.880]  And I just say congratulations, because every single thing that they said has taken place exactly like they said.
[01:14:57.880 --> 01:15:04.764]  You know, I mentioned to your audience back about two years ago where the price of gold and silver was going.
[01:15:04.764 --> 01:15:12.568]  Do you realize that it costs as much today to mail an ounce of silver, a silver dollar, as it did to buy it in 1960?
[01:15:14.723 --> 01:15:16.225]  Alex, you ought to be congratulated.
[01:15:16.225 --> 01:15:24.496]  I just sit back here amazed and am always considered such a privilege to be on InfoWars.
[01:15:24.496 --> 01:15:26.699]  Well, Lindsey, you've got the floor.
[01:15:26.699 --> 01:15:32.627]  Give us any new information you have, what's happening in the Middle East, where all this is going.
[01:15:34.076 --> 01:15:35.397]  Well, yes.
[01:15:35.397 --> 01:15:43.360]  I have been in contact with the other Mr. X in my book, Energy Non-Crisis, two different times in the past, so about a week and a half.
[01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:48.622]  And some of the things I've been given, again, it's like the information they've given me in the past.
[01:15:48.622 --> 01:15:49.862]  It's startling.
[01:15:49.862 --> 01:15:55.444]  But again, may I say to everyone out there in your listening audience, I take no credit for this.
[01:15:55.444 --> 01:15:56.965]  I'm just an ordinary, everyday guy.
[01:15:57.665 --> 01:16:09.661]  That puts on his britches just like any other man on any given day, and it's by the providence of God that I've known all of this so that I could give it to you over the air here at InfoWars today.
[01:16:09.661 --> 01:16:15.249]  The Muslim Brotherhood, I think this is probably the most critical thing that's been given to me just recently.
[01:16:15.969 --> 01:16:28.373]  We are going to give, or we are in the process of giving, now this came from my source, we are in the process of giving Egypt and Libya to the Muslim Brotherhood.
[01:16:28.373 --> 01:16:38.596]  I think the average person would not have the slightest idea as to how startling this is going to be because this is going to spread all over the Middle East.
[01:16:38.596 --> 01:16:41.757]  And I'm glad that you picked up on that on yesterday because I did also.
[01:16:43.177 --> 01:16:52.563]  Saudi Arabia oil minister on yesterday was interviewed on national news and he said that the price of crude oil is going from $200 to $300 a barrel.
[01:16:52.563 --> 01:16:58.247]  Now, do you suppose this man knows nothing about what he's talking about?
[01:16:58.247 --> 01:17:02.970]  He knows things that the average person doesn't have the slightest idea of the knowledge of.
[01:17:03.570 --> 01:17:04.490]  And he's right.
[01:17:04.490 --> 01:17:07.752]  Now, he said $200 to $300 a barrel.
[01:17:07.752 --> 01:17:12.394]  I was told a number of months ago that it was going to $200 a barrel.
[01:17:12.394 --> 01:17:16.976]  When I heard the Saudi Arabian oil minister say $300, I was startled.
[01:17:16.976 --> 01:17:23.918]  They may take it to that, because they've got to do it in order to take the price of gold to $3,000 an ounce.
[01:17:23.918 --> 01:17:24.879]  I hope you're hearing this.
[01:17:25.559 --> 01:17:38.104]  Gold and silver is such a vital part of this whole thing, because in order to have a new world order currency in the future, they must back it with gold and silver.
[01:17:38.104 --> 01:17:42.685]  In order to do that, they have got to take gold to $300 an ounce, silver to $50 to $100 an ounce,
[01:17:48.200 --> 01:17:56.047]  I told this on your program back, oh my goodness, it was nearly two years ago that the price of gold and silver was only going to go one way.
[01:17:56.047 --> 01:17:57.288]  It's quite interesting.
[01:17:57.288 --> 01:18:05.254]  Just the other day, in the last few days, I had a phone call from a friend of mine who is a very prominent businessman over in the Las Vegas area.
[01:18:05.254 --> 01:18:08.417]  And he mentioned our conversation about a year ago.
[01:18:08.417 --> 01:18:10.379]  He said, Lindsey, about a year ago I called you.
[01:18:11.079 --> 01:18:15.626]  And I said, well, I think gold and silver has gone to its peak.
[01:18:15.626 --> 01:18:19.031]  This business man over in Las Vegas said that about a year ago.
[01:18:19.031 --> 01:18:20.974]  He said gold and silver has got to its peak.
[01:18:20.974 --> 01:18:23.298]  He said, I think I'll sell everything I've got.
[01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:27.541]  And I told him, I said, don't you dare do that.
[01:18:27.541 --> 01:18:28.702]  This was a year ago now.
[01:18:28.702 --> 01:18:30.963]  I said, don't you dare sell your gold and silver.
[01:18:30.963 --> 01:18:32.164]  I said, you're going to keep going up.
[01:18:32.164 --> 01:18:33.465]  He said, no, no, no.
[01:18:33.465 --> 01:18:37.007]  I think it's leveled out and it's gotten about as high as it's going.
[01:18:37.007 --> 01:18:38.348]  I said, no, it's not.
[01:18:38.348 --> 01:18:40.129]  I said, it's going to keep going right up.
[01:18:40.129 --> 01:18:45.572]  Well, I talked to him the other day and he said, Chaplain Williams, I am so glad I took your advice.
[01:18:45.572 --> 01:18:51.776]  He said, if I sold my gold and silver a year ago because I thought it had reached the peak, I said, well, you haven't seen anything yet.
[01:18:52.436 --> 01:18:55.737]  I said, you're going to see gold go to $3,000 an ounce.
[01:18:55.737 --> 01:18:59.379]  You're going to see silver continue to climb.
[01:18:59.379 --> 01:19:09.382]  And it's amazing how some people, and you in particular, Alex, have been willing to accept this information that the elitists have given me over the years.
[01:19:09.382 --> 01:19:14.044]  And as a result, every single time it's been exact, as they said.
[01:19:14.044 --> 01:19:16.145]  Now, what's going to happen in the Middle East?
[01:19:17.347 --> 01:19:22.391]  Egypt and Libya both are being given... Did you hear this?
[01:19:22.391 --> 01:19:23.932]  I just got this.
[01:19:23.932 --> 01:19:28.036]  Egypt and Libya both are being given to the Muslim Brotherhood.
[01:19:28.036 --> 01:19:31.378]  Now, right now, Egypt does not have a government.
[01:19:31.378 --> 01:19:32.839]  It's in shambles.
[01:19:32.839 --> 01:19:34.200]  Wait till September.
[01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:35.862]  They're going to elect a new government.
[01:19:37.543 --> 01:19:42.145]  Dr. David Barry has provided excellent advice for all those interested in practical economics and sound money.
[01:20:07.296 --> 01:20:08.898]  It's certainly worth reading.
[01:20:08.898 --> 01:20:16.986]  That's what Congressman Ron Paul said about Cha-Ching Wisdom 123 Practical Universal Truths About Money, the new book by Dr. David Barry.
[01:20:16.986 --> 01:20:25.975]  The cool part of this book, certainly it'll speak to you personally, your life, your lifestyle, your money, your investments, but it also can be generalized into the nation, what's going on as a nation.
[01:20:25.975 --> 01:20:28.358]  We do these same things personally that we do as a nation.
[01:20:28.758 --> 01:20:38.585]  Dr. Barry's book, Cha-Ching Wisdom, presents many facets of your relationship with the once-almighty dollar and how current national and international politics affect your daily life.
[01:20:38.585 --> 01:20:40.306]  Some of the other things are about that.
[01:20:40.306 --> 01:20:41.887]  They're not just economic.
[01:20:41.887 --> 01:20:42.928]  They're philosophical.
[01:20:42.928 --> 01:20:44.609]  There's psychology involved in this book.
[01:20:44.609 --> 01:20:46.270]  There's philosophy involved in this book.
[01:20:46.270 --> 01:20:49.832]  Read Cha-Ching Wisdom by Dr. David Barry, only $9.95.

[01:21:00.845 --> 01:21:02.326]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:21:02.326 --> 01:21:03.367]  The real U.S.
[01:21:03.367 --> 01:21:08.672]  unemployment rate is now 22%, and not 9%, like what we are told by the mainstream media.
[01:21:08.672 --> 01:21:13.496]  The primary instinct of unemployed Americans is to go to college and seek a higher education.
[01:21:13.496 --> 01:21:19.061]  But all across America, students are graduating with hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt and no jobs.
[01:21:19.461 --> 01:21:27.624]  Most college graduates are now admitting that they would have been better off getting a job at Walmart or McDonald's than having their lives destroyed by student loans.
[01:21:27.624 --> 01:21:35.167]  Our friends at the National Inflation Association are getting ready to release College Conspiracy, the world's most comprehensive documentary ever produced.
[01:21:35.387 --> 01:21:35.627]  We're good.
[01:21:59.648 --> 01:22:00.829]  Go solar for cheap!

[01:22:29.339 --> 01:22:30.580]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:30.580 --> 01:22:35.142]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:22:35.142 --> 01:22:40.965]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:22:40.965 --> 01:22:44.606]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:22:44.606 --> 01:22:49.468]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:49.468 --> 01:22:52.370]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[01:22:52.370 --> 01:22:52.670]  Call 800-686-2237.

[01:24:07.762 --> 01:24:19.930]  We got Max Keiser popping in in the last 20 minutes of the broadcast today on the big breakout of Silver, the crashed JPMorgan Buy Silver program that he launched months ago.
[01:24:19.930 --> 01:24:22.152]  Lindsey Williams will be with us a little bit in the next hour.
[01:24:22.152 --> 01:24:26.615]  I do want to open the phones up for your questions for Lindsey Williams at 800-259-9231.
[01:24:26.615 --> 01:24:35.421]  Lindsey, you've also been attacked a lot from mainstream media, alternative, because you've been so right.
[01:24:36.261 --> 01:24:37.882]  And that's another indicator.
[01:24:37.882 --> 01:24:39.183]  I know who your sources are.
[01:24:39.183 --> 01:24:41.665]  Ken Fromm's now public, because he's died.
[01:24:41.665 --> 01:24:42.886]  The other guy's even bigger.
[01:24:42.886 --> 01:24:44.086]  I know his name.
[01:24:44.086 --> 01:24:46.748]  I know people that have talked to him and confirmed this.
[01:24:46.748 --> 01:24:48.609]  I haven't attempted to call him.
[01:24:48.609 --> 01:24:52.352]  But I know your other source, former CEO of a big three.
[01:24:52.352 --> 01:24:54.133]  And the proof is in the pudding of what you said.
[01:24:54.133 --> 01:24:55.874]  Now, you got cut off by the break.
[01:24:55.874 --> 01:25:00.097]  You were getting into handing it over to the Muslim Brotherhood.
[01:25:00.097 --> 01:25:04.340]  The headline of the Wall Street Journal was, Mujahideen Al-Qaeda are the core
[01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:12.189]  Are the core of these groups, so just like they used them to take over the Serbs in Kosovo, they used them against the Russians.
[01:25:12.189 --> 01:25:18.737]  They're just switching back to their old game with Al-Qaeda, just like Amir al-Awlaki, the head of Al-Qaeda, secretly hangs out at the Pentagon.
[01:25:18.737 --> 01:25:21.280]  Source Fox News AP getting orders.
[01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:23.202]  I mean, he's the guy running all these domestic attacks.
[01:25:24.162 --> 01:25:30.546]  I hope, Alex, that you have some of the Middle East Kings and wherever family is listening to your show today.
[01:25:48.149 --> 01:25:56.296]  Because the next item that I've been given just recently is so startling that... But again, you remember the day that I said it was going from $147 a barrel to $50 a barrel?
[01:25:56.296 --> 01:26:01.280]  And talk show hosts around the country laughed at me.
[01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:03.282]  You were willing to at least accept what I said.
[01:26:03.682 --> 01:26:09.045]  Because, Lindsey, if it didn't come out to be true, it just meant that your sources double-crossed you.
[01:26:09.045 --> 01:26:10.946]  I mean, Stan Monteith's talked to your sources.
[01:26:10.946 --> 01:26:12.166]  I know who they are.
[01:26:12.166 --> 01:26:13.467]  I've read your book you wrote in 81.
[01:26:13.467 --> 01:26:16.589]  I mean, you were on record working there.
[01:26:16.589 --> 01:26:21.111]  It was on record that Fromm got fired when your book came out and then rehired.
[01:26:22.287 --> 01:26:32.534]  Well, it's now on record, I hope, as of your show today, if any of the Middle East kings and royal families are listening, you're on your way out.
[01:26:32.534 --> 01:26:37.738]  First of all, it was Mubarak in Egypt, and then it's Gaddafi in Libya.
[01:26:37.738 --> 01:26:39.519]  He's just a little more stubborn.
[01:26:39.519 --> 01:26:41.721]  It's going to take longer to get him out of there.
[01:26:41.721 --> 01:26:45.043]  Then it's going to be one country after the other.
[01:26:45.043 --> 01:26:46.984]  Syria, Bahrain, Yemen.
[01:26:46.984 --> 01:26:50.387]  These guys always use buzzwords when they said
[01:26:51.007 --> 01:26:58.191]  Destabilization, and when they said the prices were going to go up, and that things were going to change, we now see what that is.
[01:26:58.191 --> 01:27:08.918]  And when they told you they're going to double-cross the Arabs, that's what you're saying is, that's not, now they've told you, that's not just cheating them out of their T-bills, that means basically backing their overthrow as well.
[01:27:09.636 --> 01:27:11.198]  They are going to be overthrown.
[01:27:11.198 --> 01:27:12.239]  Mark my words.
[01:27:12.239 --> 01:27:21.989]  The royal families in the Middle East, the oil barons, one after the other, are going to be overthrown until they have done exactly what they want to do.
[01:27:21.989 --> 01:27:27.014]  They did it in Egypt, and now we have given Egypt to the Muslim Brotherhood.
[01:27:27.014 --> 01:27:29.557]  Do you realize that the Muslim Brotherhood is jihad?
[01:27:29.557 --> 01:27:32.040]  They're going to put in sharia law.
[01:27:33.140 --> 01:27:36.342]  By the way, no, stop, stop, stop!
[01:27:36.342 --> 01:27:39.985]  The Egyptian government banned protests last week, and I meant to cover this two days ago.
[01:27:39.985 --> 01:27:41.205]  Guys, put it into the search engine.
[01:27:41.205 --> 01:27:43.127]  I want to back up Pastor Williams.
[01:27:43.127 --> 01:27:49.711]  Egyptian government calls for modesty police just like Iran, so they literally are doing this.
[01:27:50.748 --> 01:27:52.370]  Yes, and they believe in the Koran.
[01:27:52.370 --> 01:27:55.013]  They do not believe in the Bible as God's Word.
[01:27:55.013 --> 01:27:56.615]  In fact, they hate it.
[01:27:56.615 --> 01:27:58.798]  We are considered infidels.
[01:27:58.798 --> 01:28:00.640]  Women, oh my goodness.
[01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:05.567]  Well, Lindsey, just to be clear, and we're going to go to break in a long segment coming up, I want to interrupt you because I want you to be able to go.
[01:28:06.127 --> 01:28:10.834]  I'm not here, and I know you're a Baptist pastor, and I respect you, and I'm a Christian myself.
[01:28:10.834 --> 01:28:22.891]  I mean, a lot of the Muslims don't want war and don't hate Christians, but the point is, the groups they're putting in do want war and have been calling for crises so the globalists can have this larger clash of civilizations.
[01:28:23.462 --> 01:28:25.743]  Motherland Brotherhood is militant.
[01:28:25.743 --> 01:28:27.645]  And do you know what happens to women?
[01:28:27.645 --> 01:28:35.830]  You know, we talk about segregation, we talk about nobody being put down or talked bad about in America.
[01:28:35.830 --> 01:28:47.557]  You know, every single woman's organization in the United States of America should literally be raising the roof, shouting, uh, holy horrid to Washington that the Muslim Brotherhood is going to be taking over all of these Middle East countries.
[01:28:47.557 --> 01:28:51.699]  You know what rights women are going to have under the Muslim Brotherhood?
[01:28:51.699 --> 01:28:52.780]  Ladies, where are you?
[01:28:53.260 --> 01:29:05.906]  Why in this world aren't you out there shouting to the top of your voice that this is the most cruel thing that could ever happen on the face of this earth, is for our government to basically... Okay, a week and a half ago, you ready?
[01:29:05.906 --> 01:29:07.326]  I may as well give it right now.
[01:29:07.326 --> 01:29:09.768]  And then if we have to, we'll take it up on the next part.
[01:29:09.768 --> 01:29:17.091]  A week and a half ago, our Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, went to Libya.
[01:29:17.091 --> 01:29:21.353]  I heard it one time on the national news, then I found out from my source what it was all about.
[01:29:30.876 --> 01:29:32.517]  Stay there, stay there, Lindsey.
[01:29:32.517 --> 01:29:33.737]  Eighteen minute segment coming up.
[01:29:33.737 --> 01:29:35.638]  You'll have the floor when we come back.
[01:29:35.638 --> 01:29:37.938]  The double cross, the overthrow of the Arab countries.
[01:29:37.938 --> 01:29:41.439]  You were just told this by your powerful source.
[01:29:41.439 --> 01:29:42.860]  On the other side, break it all down.
[01:29:42.860 --> 01:29:44.600]  What's going on with Hillary?
[01:29:44.600 --> 01:29:45.101]  Quick break.
[01:29:45.101 --> 01:29:46.441]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:29:46.441 --> 01:29:49.082]  I'm Alex Jones with InfoWars.com interviewing Lindsey Williams.
[01:29:50.851 --> 01:29:54.777]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.777 --> 01:29:57.440]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.438 --> 01:30:04.981]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:30:04.981 --> 01:30:05.901]  Number 1.
[01:30:05.901 --> 01:30:09.324]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:30:09.324 --> 01:30:10.184]  Number 2.
[01:30:10.184 --> 01:30:15.067]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:30:15.067 --> 01:30:15.808]  It's true.
[01:30:15.808 --> 01:30:20.691]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:30:20.691 --> 01:30:21.511]  Number 3.
[01:30:21.511 --> 01:30:25.094]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:30:25.094 --> 01:30:28.796]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:30:28.996 --> 01:30:29.796]  Number 4.
[01:30:29.796 --> 01:30:32.558]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:30:32.558 --> 01:30:36.239]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:30:36.239 --> 01:30:37.019]  Number 5.
[01:30:37.019 --> 01:30:41.181]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:30:41.181 --> 01:30:46.223]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:30:46.223 --> 01:30:50.405]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:30:50.405 --> 01:30:52.186]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:30:52.186 --> 01:30:56.788]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com, or call 1-866-422-9000.
[01:31:00.571 --> 01:31:04.174]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[01:31:04.174 --> 01:31:05.295]  It ended on June of 2009.
[01:31:05.295 --> 01:31:09.859]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[01:31:09.859 --> 01:31:15.804]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[01:31:15.804 --> 01:31:17.946]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[01:31:17.946 --> 01:31:20.628]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[01:31:20.968 --> 01:31:27.472]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[01:31:27.472 --> 01:31:29.693]  They both make fabulous investments.
[01:31:29.693 --> 01:31:35.017]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[01:31:35.017 --> 01:31:40.320]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[01:31:40.320 --> 01:31:45.443]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long-term.
[01:31:45.663 --> 01:31:48.866]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[01:31:48.866 --> 01:31:51.869]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[01:31:51.869 --> 01:31:53.070]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[01:31:53.070 --> 01:31:53.730]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:31:53.730 --> 01:31:57.674]  citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:31:57.674 --> 01:32:00.176]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:32:10.546 --> 01:32:15.930]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:32:15.930 --> 01:32:18.972]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:32:18.972 --> 01:32:21.293]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:32:21.293 --> 01:32:27.537]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:32:27.537 --> 01:32:30.919]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:32:30.919 --> 01:32:36.703]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:32:36.703 --> 01:32:38.344]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:32:38.344 --> 01:32:39.465]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:32:39.625 --> 01:32:42.307]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:32:42.307 --> 01:32:46.529]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:32:46.529 --> 01:32:51.152]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[01:32:51.152 --> 01:32:53.734]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[01:33:04.505 --> 01:33:10.752]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:15.418 --> 01:33:17.779]  We're going back to Lindsey Williams here in just a moment.
[01:33:17.779 --> 01:33:19.580]  He'll be with us a little bit in the next hour.
[01:33:19.580 --> 01:33:27.425]  Scott, John, Julio, Bob, Tony, we're going to get to all of you here live on air coming up in about 10-15 minutes from now.
[01:33:27.425 --> 01:33:40.913]  But I want Lindsey to be able to calmly go through the Globalist Master Plan, the plan to overthrow all of these Arab-run countries that have royalty in charge or plutocrats.
[01:33:40.913 --> 01:33:42.574]  Will that include Jordan?
[01:33:43.871 --> 01:33:44.251]  The Global
[01:33:59.983 --> 01:34:02.605]  Because he has this insider information.
[01:34:02.605 --> 01:34:05.868]  But continuing here, I want to tell you about Pure Water Freedom.
[01:34:05.868 --> 01:34:07.349]  PureWaterFreedom.com.
[01:34:07.349 --> 01:34:11.413]  If you want to affordably remove fluoride from your tap water, visit PureWaterFreedom.com.
[01:34:11.413 --> 01:34:13.074]  They have a full line of household fluoride filters.
[01:34:13.074 --> 01:34:17.317]  You can even remove fluoride from every water source in your home with a whole house fluoride system.
[01:34:18.038 --> 01:34:18.178]  I don't
[01:34:40.805 --> 01:34:42.807]  De-pegging the dollar is the world reserve currency.
[01:34:42.807 --> 01:34:46.269]  See the free video at EndOfAmericaTheNumberThree.com.
[01:34:46.269 --> 01:34:48.070]  That's EndOfAmericaTheNumberThree.com.

[01:34:55.396 --> 01:34:57.677]  They have more subscribers than the New York Times.
[01:34:57.677 --> 01:35:02.981]  They recently created an eye-opening video you can see for free at EndOfAmericaThree.com.

[01:35:08.516 --> 01:35:12.759]  Lastly, I want to tell you about Diamond Gusset and their April special.
[01:35:12.759 --> 01:35:19.404]  They've got big discounts running for the month of April, and they also financed and helped get the new song out.
[01:35:19.404 --> 01:35:26.429]  Just an amazing Mark Wills song that wasn't even on the charts until it aired here first, and then they wanted me to point that out and thank the listeners.
[01:35:27.229 --> 01:35:31.230]  It's gone down to number four on the GAC Big Country Charts.
[01:35:31.230 --> 01:35:33.530]  You heard it here first from Diamond Gussett.
[01:35:33.530 --> 01:35:44.112]  You can hear the song, of course, for free in the MP3 at gussett.com forward slash sale and check out all the big sales and discounts of the Made in America jeans and other great clothing products.
[01:35:44.112 --> 01:35:46.532]  They celebrate 25 years this year, by the way.
[01:35:46.532 --> 01:35:52.613]  gussett.com forward slash sale and looking for America number four on the GAC Charts.
[01:35:52.613 --> 01:35:55.154]  When they called me and said, hey, we're trying to get this
[01:35:55.874 --> 01:35:59.538]  This song out about restoring America, getting factories back, stopping the globalists.
[01:35:59.538 --> 01:36:00.999]  Would you air it?
[01:36:00.999 --> 01:36:01.981]  And I said, let me hear the song.
[01:36:01.981 --> 01:36:03.222]  I was like, man, this is a really good country.
[01:36:03.222 --> 01:36:05.364]  Yeah, I'll air it.
[01:36:05.364 --> 01:36:06.065]  It's a good message.
[01:36:06.065 --> 01:36:07.907]  It's what we need to use the media for.
[01:36:07.907 --> 01:36:09.348]  And see, the truth sells.
[01:36:09.348 --> 01:36:10.650]  Number four.
[01:36:10.650 --> 01:36:11.551]  I want it to go to number one.
[01:36:12.441 --> 01:36:14.122]  So requestations play it.
[01:36:14.122 --> 01:36:17.743]  Okay, let's go ahead now and go back to Lindsay.
[01:36:17.743 --> 01:36:19.443]  Lindsay, I'm going to try to shut up, sit back.
[01:36:19.443 --> 01:36:21.364]  I just want to add, I looked it up.
[01:36:21.364 --> 01:36:24.785]  You're saying your inside source says she went to eastern Libya.
[01:36:24.785 --> 01:36:33.268]  They're reporting she's had a bunch of meetings the last three weeks in Europe and London's closed meetings with the Muslim Brotherhood and quote the Libyan rebel leadership.
[01:36:33.928 --> 01:36:38.313]  And then the head of the rebels was in the New York Times admitting, I sent people to kill Americans.
[01:36:38.313 --> 01:36:39.974]  So he is Al-Qaeda.
[01:36:39.974 --> 01:36:42.717]  Of course, he's been in Virginia, another one for two decades.
[01:36:42.717 --> 01:36:45.840]  I mean, this is red-handed that we're talking about.
[01:36:45.840 --> 01:36:49.244]  So break down, recap the master plan, where this is going.
[01:36:49.244 --> 01:36:52.307]  Your source saying they're going to go all the way to Riyadh.
[01:36:52.307 --> 01:36:53.928]  They're going to overthrow the king.
[01:36:53.928 --> 01:36:55.590]  The king is meeting with Gates.
[01:36:56.631 --> 01:37:03.337]  Six months ago on The Informed Rose, I said that I had just been told on the phone by my elitist friend that there was going to be a crisis in the Middle East.
[01:37:03.337 --> 01:37:04.618]  It began in Egypt.
[01:37:04.618 --> 01:37:06.720]  Then it went over to Libya.
[01:37:06.720 --> 01:37:09.282]  It will spread from one part of the Middle East to the other.
[01:37:23.687 --> 01:37:24.928]  It is a master plan.
[01:37:24.928 --> 01:37:29.991]  I did not know at the time what the extent of this was going to be.
[01:37:29.991 --> 01:37:35.515]  One week after the crisis in Egypt, my friend told me again everything that was going to happen.
[01:37:35.515 --> 01:37:38.317]  And last time I was on InfoWars, I gave that.
[01:37:38.317 --> 01:37:43.821]  How that they will spread this crisis situation through the entire Middle East.
[01:37:43.821 --> 01:37:46.042]  How that the elite are supporting.
[01:37:46.042 --> 01:37:48.504]  They are the ones behind them with the money.
[01:37:48.504 --> 01:37:51.886]  Of the Muslim Brotherhood, which is Jihad.
[01:37:51.886 --> 01:37:52.907]  It is Shias.
[01:37:54.969 --> 01:37:59.696]  By the way, that's on record that the West is funding all the rebels and starting all this.
[01:37:59.696 --> 01:38:00.778]  So that's on record.
[01:38:01.849 --> 01:38:04.930]  And the women of America should be raising the roof.
[01:38:04.930 --> 01:38:16.873]  If you say that you believe in women's rights, for goodness sakes, why don't you start taking some action with what the Muslim Brotherhood's going to do to their little poor women in every one of these countries that they take over.
[01:38:16.873 --> 01:38:21.874]  And as it were, spread from place to place, every middle- Okay, here we go.
[01:38:21.874 --> 01:38:23.595]  Please, put this down.
[01:38:23.595 --> 01:38:24.835]  Every Middle East kid.
[01:38:24.855 --> 01:38:25.055]  I think?
[01:38:41.784 --> 01:38:42.605]  We're good to go.
[01:39:02.819 --> 01:39:06.323]  I want to be clear, the purpose is not to give freedom to the people.
[01:39:06.323 --> 01:39:07.605]  I mean, who likes Mubarak?
[01:39:07.605 --> 01:39:09.126]  They're putting something in worse.
[01:39:09.126 --> 01:39:12.250]  Banning protests, bringing in the modesty police.
[01:39:12.250 --> 01:39:15.033]  We just put that headline up earlier.
[01:39:15.033 --> 01:39:18.598]  They're getting rid of Gaddafi, putting in Al-Qaeda.
[01:39:18.598 --> 01:39:20.320]  They're going to put even worse people in.
[01:39:21.605 --> 01:39:27.368]  So last week our Secretary of State Hillary Clinton actually met with the Muslim Brotherhood.
[01:39:27.368 --> 01:39:35.333]  She met that for the purpose of guaranteeing them that each country that they take over, they will have the government of that country.
[01:39:35.333 --> 01:39:41.356]  Mark my words, you are going to see the Muslim Brotherhood put in in September whenever they have the elections in Egypt.
[01:39:41.896 --> 01:39:47.240]  Once Qaddafi is removed out of Libya, the Muslim Brotherhood will take over.
[01:39:47.240 --> 01:39:54.145]  This is being done, but to me it's so interesting how the elite create a crisis and then create a solution.
[01:39:54.145 --> 01:40:00.769]  They're going to use the Muslim Brotherhood over however long a period of time it takes them to accomplish what they want.
[01:40:00.769 --> 01:40:08.095]  And they will be scuttled again in the end because the whole thing turns out with the New World Order over a period of years.
[01:40:08.935 --> 01:40:09.355]  We're good to go.
[01:40:38.835 --> 01:40:41.379]  Our government better take immediate action.
[01:40:41.379 --> 01:40:44.463]  This is an action that is not going to end.
[01:40:44.463 --> 01:40:48.309]  It's nowhere near coming to a close.
[01:40:48.309 --> 01:40:54.418]  It's going to go from country to country, Syria is killing them, Bahrain, you're going to have Yemen.
[01:40:54.938 --> 01:40:57.080]  The last place is Saudi Arabia.
[01:40:57.080 --> 01:41:06.090]  The reason for this is, as I was told one week after the first crisis in Egypt, was to raise the price of crude oil to $200 a barrel.
[01:41:06.090 --> 01:41:10.414]  Now Saudi Arabia's oil minister is saying $400 a barrel possible.
[01:41:10.414 --> 01:41:11.315]  Well, I don't know that.
[01:41:11.315 --> 01:41:17.142]  I haven't been told that, but I was told $200 a barrel for the purpose of laying about
[01:41:17.722 --> 01:41:19.084]  The end result.
[01:41:19.084 --> 01:41:20.025]  Now, notice this.
[01:41:20.025 --> 01:41:21.126]  End result.
[01:41:21.126 --> 01:41:25.491]  Saudi Arabia supplies more crude oil to America than any other country.
[01:41:25.491 --> 01:41:34.400]  And the end result is what they want, which Saudi Arabia, when it hits them, mark my words, you'll have $200 a barrel, you'll have $6, $7, $8 a gallon at the gas pump.
[01:41:37.063 --> 01:41:40.326]  My son, this past weekend, was in California.
[01:41:40.326 --> 01:41:43.870]  He actually took a picture and brought it home to me.
[01:41:43.870 --> 01:41:49.535]  $4.83 a gallon in California for diesel fuel last weekend.
[01:41:49.535 --> 01:42:01.026]  Now, the end result of all of this is to take the price of crude oil where they want it, to basically make it non-available because of all the crisis that will take place in the Middle East.
[01:42:01.426 --> 01:42:03.588]  So that they can collapse the dollar.
[01:42:03.588 --> 01:42:08.972]  Don't you understand that the New World Order is not destroying America?
[01:42:08.972 --> 01:42:11.554]  The New World Order is taking over America.
[01:42:11.554 --> 01:42:13.776]  It is a matter of control.
[01:42:13.776 --> 01:42:30.730]  And in order to do it, they have to take the price of crude oil to $200 a barrel, collapse the dollar, bring it to a situation of having so little purchasing power by the end of 2012 that the government of the United States of America will have to default on its debt.
[01:42:31.190 --> 01:42:41.197]  You realize this is a long-range program through the end of 2012 to bring about basically a control of America so they can control the whole world.
[01:42:41.197 --> 01:42:44.739]  After all, we've had the reserve currency of the world for all of these years.
[01:42:44.739 --> 01:42:48.482]  There's got to be a default on the American debt right now.
[01:42:48.482 --> 01:42:49.843]  We are in horrible trouble.
[01:42:49.843 --> 01:42:53.125]  Just listen to Congress and what they're saying about the debt crisis.
[01:42:53.125 --> 01:43:00.270]  They can't even get anything together up there whatsoever for Friday being the day that the budget runs out.
[01:43:01.071 --> 01:43:04.503]  Whenever the dollar collapses, do you realize what's going to happen to China?
[01:43:05.461 --> 01:43:11.163]  Who holds one trillion dollars of our paper, T-bills, and have trusted it.
[01:43:11.163 --> 01:43:23.767]  All of these kings and heads of state in the oil producing countries of the world, they have trusted it because there was nothing as sound as the American dollar and our T-bills and our Federal Reserve issues.
[01:43:23.767 --> 01:43:28.108]  When all of this collapses, can you imagine what the end result of it is going to be?
[01:43:28.108 --> 01:43:33.230]  It's going to be a total takeover of the new world order, but in order to do that,
[01:43:33.670 --> 01:43:34.711]  We're good to go.
[01:43:48.863 --> 01:43:51.346]  You haven't seen anything yet.
[01:43:51.346 --> 01:43:52.487]  I am pleading with you.
[01:43:52.487 --> 01:43:53.609]  I'm begging of you.
[01:43:53.609 --> 01:44:01.117]  I don't care if you lose $1,455 on Alex right now and Silver's $3,950 in pushing parity.
[01:44:01.117 --> 01:44:02.178]  It doesn't matter.
[01:44:02.178 --> 01:44:03.920]  Go buy it because he's going to go to $3,000.
[01:44:09.467 --> 01:44:11.709]  Exactly, they're going to back their One World Government currency with it.
[01:44:11.709 --> 01:44:22.939]  Ron Paul said yesterday on air, and we're going to add this to our article that's linked up on Drudge right now, when Ron Paul basically said that he would be announcing in the next month that he's probably going to run for president.
[01:44:22.939 --> 01:44:31.025]  Now we're going to add to that article an update, headline, Ron Paul, Gold Commodity Prices Signal Big Event Economic Collapse.
[01:44:32.026 --> 01:44:48.492]  And it's a simple rule that if you devalue the global currency, the dollar, that it isn't that gold and silver have gone up, it just takes more of those dollars to buy that gold and silver, and it signifies the beginning of the serious inflation.
[01:44:48.492 --> 01:44:50.212]  And Ron Paul agreed.
[01:44:50.212 --> 01:44:57.215]  The One World Government crowd, the New World Order crowd, this is Ron Paul, the big presidential contender, concurring with us.
[01:44:58.444 --> 01:45:11.852]  That as they do this, they need to destroy the existing orders of the world to bring in the new Bancor Global One World Government Currency because things will get so bad, they will offer this as the solution.
[01:45:11.852 --> 01:45:16.134]  We are now entering that time of crises ordered out of chaos.
[01:45:16.134 --> 01:45:17.715]  What else did your source tell you?
[01:45:17.715 --> 01:45:18.696]  Any other key tidbits?
[01:45:19.412 --> 01:45:25.741]  Alex, isn't it amazing, and I sit here listening to you right now just utterly stunned because you're exactly right.
[01:45:25.741 --> 01:45:36.216]  Isn't it amazing that everything that Mr. Fromm told me before he died, everything that my elitist friend now is telling me, that every single bit of it they told me two years, three years ago,
[01:45:36.656 --> 01:45:45.760]  Back 35 years ago when Mr. Fromm told me that they were not going to open up Gar Island and the Arctic Wildlife Refuge until they got the price of crude oil to where they wanted it to go.
[01:45:45.760 --> 01:45:48.301]  And at the time he wouldn't tell me what that price was.
[01:45:48.301 --> 01:45:51.682]  But then I found out just recently that they wanted to go to $200 a barrel.
[01:45:51.682 --> 01:46:01.646]  Isn't it amazing that every single thing that these people said way back yonder 2, 3, 4, 5, 10 years ago, now Ron Paul is talking about it.
[01:46:01.646 --> 01:46:04.767]  Now the national newsletters of almost every single writer
[01:46:04.867 --> 01:46:15.233]  And then oil and natural gas is going to be scapegoated for this, and they're going to force us onto the new green economy that costs two or three or four times even what oil does.
[01:46:15.233 --> 01:46:20.377]  This is the shutdown of our industrial system, the stated UN plan.
[01:46:20.377 --> 01:46:26.040]  The head of NASA, Goddard Center, says he wants a post-industrial America, shut off our power.
[01:46:26.040 --> 01:46:27.221]  This is how they're doing it.
[01:46:27.221 --> 01:46:28.622]  They'll sell us less of it.
[01:46:29.102 --> 01:46:43.234]  For a much higher price, when they built our whole society off interstate highways under the Eisenhower plan, when you've got to travel to get to work, when most people can't use buses or trains, they are holding us hostage.
[01:46:43.234 --> 01:46:55.163]  They got us dependent on oil, and now they're shutting down the refineries, they're shutting down the supply, they have engineered this whole thing beautifully for global control, and they will pose as the saviors.
[01:46:55.163 --> 01:46:56.845]  Anything else he tells you, then we're going to calls.
[01:46:57.762 --> 01:47:04.983]  Well, first of all, he said that our Secretary of State had met, Hillary Clinton, had actually met with the Muslim Brotherhood.
[01:47:04.983 --> 01:47:09.144]  And they have been guaranteed that they will be given each of the nations they take over.
[01:47:09.144 --> 01:47:10.005]  What?
[01:47:10.005 --> 01:47:14.886]  We're being so betrayed by Washington, D.C., it is faddling to me as I hear all of this.
[01:47:14.886 --> 01:47:18.906]  So, when she met with them, she said, okay, go ahead and take all these countries.
[01:47:18.906 --> 01:47:21.027]  This never appeared on the news media anywhere.
[01:47:21.027 --> 01:47:25.368]  No news person was allowed to talk with her after she came out of the meetings.
[01:47:25.368 --> 01:47:26.408]  I was given a chart.
[01:47:27.368 --> 01:47:28.730]  Uh, I know this is startling.
[01:47:28.730 --> 01:47:30.652]  I haven't said this yet on your program.
[01:47:30.652 --> 01:47:39.683]  I was sent a chart by my present living, uh, elitist friend, and the chart indicated what the Muslim Brotherhood wants to do.
[01:47:39.683 --> 01:47:42.646]  Now, the elite won't let them go as far as they want to go.
[01:47:42.646 --> 01:47:46.991]  They're gonna let them go as far as taking over everything in the Middle East, every single king.
[01:47:46.991 --> 01:47:47.612]  Not my words!
[01:47:48.192 --> 01:47:51.596]  I haven't said this before because this past week I got it.
[01:47:51.596 --> 01:47:54.880]  Every Middle East King, every royal family is going to be deposed.
[01:47:54.880 --> 01:47:59.665]  They think that somehow the American government might stand with the people of Saudi Arabia.
[01:47:59.665 --> 01:48:00.326]  No way.
[01:48:00.326 --> 01:48:01.287]  You mock my words.
[01:48:01.287 --> 01:48:03.570]  The Muslim Brotherhood will eventually take it over.
[01:48:03.570 --> 01:48:05.252]  That'll be the last one to be taken.
[01:48:05.912 --> 01:48:23.138]  And they will be given, the Muslim Brotherhood will be given these countries because they want chaos in every one of them in order to cut off the oil supply basically as they've done in Libya, 1.6 million barrels was cut off in Libya from going to certain places in Europe, not America.
[01:48:23.138 --> 01:48:27.419]  When Saudi Arabia comes around, the majority of our oil supply will be cut off.
[01:48:27.419 --> 01:48:29.120]  Every bit of this is a part of the plan.
[01:48:29.700 --> 01:48:34.161]  And some people say to me, Captain Williams, why in the world would the elite destroy their own country?
[01:48:34.161 --> 01:48:36.242]  They aren't destroying their own country.
[01:48:36.242 --> 01:48:40.403]  They're gaining control of their own country, the United States of America.
[01:48:40.403 --> 01:48:42.144]  Most of them live in America.
[01:48:42.144 --> 01:48:45.645]  And they're gaining control of it by, first of all, bankrupting it.
[01:48:45.645 --> 01:48:54.928]  You don't take General Motors and Chrysler until you bankrupt them first, then you get them by way of the Treasury through the Federal Reserve,
[01:48:55.989 --> 01:49:04.055]  And they're going to bring all 50 states into receivership under the Feds, then self-bankrupt to the IMF and World Bank.
[01:49:04.693 --> 01:49:06.214]  And they have everything to gain by it.
[01:49:06.214 --> 01:49:10.316]  Every bit of this was a part of a long-range plan devised many years ago.
[01:49:10.316 --> 01:49:15.319]  I heard them referring to it 35 years ago when I sat in their business meetings.
[01:49:15.319 --> 01:49:21.963]  And, of course, they, 15 years ago, began the housing crisis about the diesel loans and the interest-only loans.
[01:49:21.963 --> 01:49:25.164]  They knew it would bring about a housing crisis.
[01:49:25.164 --> 01:49:29.167]  You haven't seen anything until the commercial real estate.
[01:49:29.167 --> 01:49:29.627]  And it's just
[01:49:29.807 --> 01:49:29.907]  Man.
[01:49:49.173 --> 01:49:51.254]  And now it sets the precedent where the globalists
[01:50:10.999 --> 01:50:18.784]  Can go fund rebels to try to overthrow a government and then in humanitarian grounds have the New World Order military come in and bombard that country.
[01:50:18.784 --> 01:50:20.925]  This is the new neo-colonial model.
[01:50:20.925 --> 01:50:24.367]  Now, Lindsey, can I keep you 15 minutes in the next hour because I really want to go to calls?
[01:50:25.527 --> 01:50:27.348]  Gladly Alex, I'll stay with you any day.
[01:50:44.994 --> 01:50:45.435]  I think so.
[01:51:03.020 --> 01:51:04.521]  $349, $359, $379.
[01:51:04.521 --> 01:51:06.983]  How much pain to the pump can you handle?
[01:51:06.983 --> 01:51:08.184]  Ease your pain now.

[01:51:51.096 --> 01:52:01.783]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:52:01.783 --> 01:52:07.366]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:52:07.366 --> 01:52:12.389]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:52:12.389 --> 01:52:17.412]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:52:17.938 --> 01:52:23.162]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:52:23.162 --> 01:52:25.483]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:52:25.483 --> 01:52:30.287]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.

[01:54:16.280 --> 01:54:20.883]  Being driven out of there.
[01:54:20.883 --> 01:54:23.284]  Big victory for George Soros.
[01:54:23.284 --> 01:54:23.945]  Continuing
[01:54:25.134 --> 01:54:28.275]  We have the Spread the Truth with the new InfoWars widget.

[01:54:33.976 --> 01:54:41.118]  A great way to get the word out to people or to go in places like MySpace that let you post it on people's pages.
[01:54:41.118 --> 01:54:49.420]  We're going to put a version up there later today that has an autoplay if you choose, just where you post it and it just plays on your site, guaranteeing that people will hear it.
[01:54:50.367 --> 01:54:53.428]  Wonderful way to force multiply our information.
[01:54:53.428 --> 01:55:00.290]  And the other big news, Ron Paul, gold commodity prices, big event signaling economic collapse.
[01:55:00.290 --> 01:55:05.732]  The Drudge Report, the New York Times, Politico, The Hill, USA Today.
[01:55:06.612 --> 01:55:30.129]  All linking to the interview and report we did yesterday with Congressman Ron Paul, where he basically said that he will announce his presidential bid sometime in the next month, if he's going to do it or not, but went on to say that he's already going ahead with the token fact that he is by agreeing to the debate in May, so that's big news as well.
[01:55:30.129 --> 01:55:33.331]  Now going to your phone calls here with Lindsey Williams.
[01:55:34.592 --> 01:55:35.213]  Yes, thanks Alex.
[01:55:35.213 --> 01:55:39.418]  Lindsey, since your last interview I've had two big questions I've been wanting to get to you.
[01:55:53.976 --> 01:55:59.641]  The first one is, you know, all of the forecasters have been predicting the crash of the dollar.
[01:55:59.641 --> 01:56:01.682]  It's absolutely certain.
[01:56:01.682 --> 01:56:12.471]  Do your elitist friends, is this a detailed forecast on their part, or are they saying, we are going to crash the dollar in late 2012?
[01:56:14.494 --> 01:56:19.416]  They said that the dollar will be dead by the end of 2012.
[01:56:19.416 --> 01:56:21.197]  I don't want to change their words.
[01:56:21.197 --> 01:56:24.458]  I try to be as exact as I can with what they say.
[01:56:24.458 --> 01:56:33.081]  Because sometimes the things behind what they're saying mean a lot more than what comes to the... Now, the dollar will not be non-existent.
[01:56:33.081 --> 01:56:40.304]  And they'll make the American people desire, beg, plead, get on their knees and beg for a new currency.
[01:56:40.304 --> 01:56:41.925]  That basically is what they want to do.
[01:56:42.978 --> 01:56:46.221]  Okay, thanks for that answer.
[01:56:46.221 --> 01:56:48.502]  My next question has to do with the Chinese.
[01:56:48.502 --> 01:56:52.285]  You barely alluded to it last interview.
[01:56:52.285 --> 01:57:02.573]  It almost seems as though there's a lot going on behind the scenes between our State Department and China and even a possible alliance with our military.
[01:57:03.422 --> 01:57:06.443]  For them to have some kind of big operation in this country.
[01:57:06.443 --> 01:57:11.445]  I've heard about these bases in Mexico that are empty, but they're fully armed.
[01:57:11.445 --> 01:57:16.908]  Oh, they've now signed official deals to use Mexican and Canadian troops in America for insurrection.
[01:57:16.908 --> 01:57:22.030]  That's Associated Press, Toronto Newspaper, and Ottawa Citizen.
[01:57:22.030 --> 01:57:24.070]  Okay.
[01:57:24.070 --> 01:57:29.113]  Our military normally would not allow China to overtake the country.
[01:57:29.113 --> 01:57:31.674]  They would bomb their tanks or whatever.
[01:57:31.674 --> 01:57:32.274]  Is it going to be
[01:57:33.547 --> 01:57:37.092]  In the back door like as peacekeepers.
[01:57:37.092 --> 01:57:42.739]  From what Joel Skousen says and from what Lindsey's saying is, it's a clash between the two.
[01:57:42.739 --> 01:57:46.704]  The Western elite, correct Lindsey, are not planning on being buddies with the Chinese.
[01:57:47.765 --> 01:57:53.572]  The Chinese, the expression was made by Ken Prom before he passed away, said, China is the big one.
[01:57:53.572 --> 01:58:00.060]  He said, watch that above everything else, no matter what we do in the Middle East, North and South Korea, anything else, he said, watch the Chinese.
[01:58:00.060 --> 01:58:01.863]  The Chinese right now, angry.
[01:58:01.863 --> 01:58:06.008]  They know they've been double-crossed or that they're going to lose over a trillion dollars of paper.
[01:58:06.548 --> 01:58:09.010]  That they were told that they could trust in.
[01:58:09.010 --> 01:58:16.055]  As a result, I have not, and I'm going to say this very emphatically, I have not been told what the Chinese will do to America.
[01:58:16.055 --> 01:58:21.358]  But I do know that they're very angry and that it is scheduled for something.
[01:58:21.358 --> 01:58:22.979]  Watch China.
[01:58:22.979 --> 01:58:24.080]  It's so important.
[01:58:24.080 --> 01:58:35.808]  Even though what's happening in the Middle East, watching China is more important than even watching over there, which of course is going to impact America more than anything because when Saudi Arabia is hit, our prices at the gas pump are going to go where they want it to go
[01:58:36.308 --> 01:58:37.849]  You are listening to GCN.

[01:59:56.007 --> 02:00:05.329]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.329 --> 02:00:06.649]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.649 --> 02:00:08.410]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.410 --> 02:00:10.170]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.170 --> 02:00:11.750]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.750 --> 02:00:13.310]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.310 --> 02:00:17.491]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.491 --> 02:00:21.592]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:25.177 --> 02:00:30.881]  Okay, I got five or six callers that I'm absolutely bent on getting to.
[02:00:30.881 --> 02:00:33.103]  John Julio, Bobby, Janice, Jack.
[02:00:33.103 --> 02:00:34.945]  We've got Lindsey Williams for two more segments.
[02:00:34.945 --> 02:00:37.446]  We'll obviously have him up in the near future again.
[02:00:37.446 --> 02:00:40.108]  Everything he laid out is happening exactly as he said it would.
[02:00:40.108 --> 02:00:41.009]  Very scary stuff.
[02:00:43.459 --> 02:00:51.366]  I just want to add, you can go to prophecyclub.com, get his latest DVD, Breaking All This Down, called Middle East, The Rest of the Story, or 888-799-6111.
[02:00:51.366 --> 02:00:55.730]  If you want to share that with your friends and family, we appreciate him breaking all this here.
[02:00:55.730 --> 02:00:56.851]  John in Wisconsin.
[02:00:56.851 --> 02:00:58.832]  John, you're on the air with Lindsey Williams.
[02:00:58.832 --> 02:00:59.173]  Go ahead.
[02:01:00.587 --> 02:01:03.611]  Hello guys, this is a real privilege to be on with you guys.
[02:01:03.611 --> 02:01:09.098]  I've got a few comments I'd like to make and get Lindsey's take on them and some questions.
[02:01:09.098 --> 02:01:15.167]  One of my things that was just answered, I think it was answered, Lindsey, you've talked a number of times about China being the big one.
[02:01:16.122 --> 02:01:25.784]  That leaves a lot to imagination, and I wonder if that ties in somehow with these reports you hear about Chinese troops being, you know, north and south of the border, but primarily south of the border.
[02:01:25.784 --> 02:01:33.485]  Well, they did give them the Panama Canal, and both sides of the government, Republican and Democrat, and all three branches went along with that.
[02:01:33.485 --> 02:01:36.266]  But, I mean, there's this obsession with the Chinese invading.
[02:01:36.266 --> 02:01:37.326]  They won't have to invade.
[02:01:37.326 --> 02:01:38.706]  They own our debt.
[02:01:38.706 --> 02:01:39.926]  They own thousands of U.S.
[02:01:39.926 --> 02:01:41.007]  companies.
[02:01:41.007 --> 02:01:42.567]  But go ahead with your question, I'm sorry.
[02:01:42.984 --> 02:01:51.672]  Well it ties in with that and the reports that I've received I believe are factual with hundreds of thousands of UN troops and foreign troops in different areas of this nation.
[02:01:51.672 --> 02:02:03.623]  So that was one thing I'd like either you or Lindsey to comment on but going back Lindsey to back in October and I listened to everything that you say especially when you're on Alex Jones programs
[02:02:04.306 --> 02:02:16.235]  You talked about, it was said in there that there was, I'm wondering if they changed their time frame because I remember you commented it was 6 to 9 months for the moving crude to be $150 to $200 a barrel.
[02:02:16.235 --> 02:02:24.521]  And then it seemed like maybe they were altering their time frame because it seemed like it was, you know, and then it was 12 months and then, you know, maybe by the end of 2012.
[02:02:24.521 --> 02:02:27.183]  And then, you know, combine that with
[02:02:28.248 --> 02:02:31.089]  The move in Brent Crude, is it specifically Brent Crude?
[02:02:31.089 --> 02:02:37.132]  Because that seems to be taking off more than the New York Crude, which wouldn't really affect the United States quite so much.
[02:02:37.132 --> 02:02:39.273]  First of all, let's go back to China.
[02:02:39.273 --> 02:02:53.299]  The greatest impact that you're going to see out of China, then I'll get to the crude question, the greatest impact you're going to see on the United States of America, can you imagine the shelves of Walmart without a single product on them, mentioned, said, made in China?
[02:02:53.299 --> 02:02:54.760]  Everything's made out of oil.
[02:02:54.760 --> 02:02:56.060]  Everything's shipped with oil.
[02:02:56.060 --> 02:02:57.701]  I mean, it drives up everything.
[02:02:58.516 --> 02:03:01.418]  Yeah, that's the greatest impact China's going to have on America.
[02:03:01.418 --> 02:03:07.082]  They're beginning to realize that they have been double-crossed, that the paper they're holding is going to become worthless.
[02:03:07.082 --> 02:03:09.523]  I'm quite sure they've listened to Alex Jones Show.
[02:03:09.523 --> 02:03:13.686]  They're bound to know what the elitists are doing.
[02:03:13.686 --> 02:03:18.049]  And as a result, they are buying gold and silver by the tons.
[02:03:18.049 --> 02:03:19.970]  Do you realize what China's doing?
[02:03:19.970 --> 02:03:21.431]  They're getting out of paper.
[02:03:21.431 --> 02:03:22.271]  John, thank you.
[02:03:22.271 --> 02:03:24.453]  And how much do we know they're selling secretly?
[02:03:24.753 --> 02:03:26.915]  Yeah, we've got to move quick to get to all these calls.
[02:03:26.915 --> 02:03:33.021]  But folks, it's in mainstream newspapers that they've signed deals to use foreign troops against the American people.
[02:03:33.021 --> 02:03:34.642]  But no one ever calls about that.
[02:03:34.642 --> 02:03:35.943]  I can't get any attention on it.
[02:03:35.943 --> 02:03:37.925]  It's always the rumors, the rumors.
[02:03:37.925 --> 02:03:40.567]  Folks, the rumors are over.
[02:03:40.567 --> 02:03:41.668]  It's in Ottawa.
[02:03:42.509 --> 02:03:43.029]  Citizen.
[02:03:43.029 --> 02:03:44.150]  It's in other papers.
[02:03:44.150 --> 02:03:45.691]  I've shown them here.
[02:03:45.691 --> 02:03:47.291]  With the headlines.
[02:03:47.291 --> 02:03:50.073]  Foreign military to be used inside the U.S.
[02:03:50.073 --> 02:03:51.753]  I don't know how else I'm telling you.
[02:03:51.753 --> 02:03:52.914]  It's admitted.
[02:03:52.914 --> 02:03:53.874]  Julio in Illinois.
[02:03:53.874 --> 02:03:54.995]  You're on the air with Lindsey Williams.
[02:03:55.967 --> 02:03:59.970]  Gentlemen, God bless you both on this beautiful Wednesday.
[02:03:59.970 --> 02:04:12.698]  Lindsay, I'm getting set to do an independent documentary on 501c3 and the churches and the Devil's Messiah.
[02:04:12.698 --> 02:04:17.061]  How is there any way I could possibly interview you sometime in the future?
[02:04:17.061 --> 02:04:25.687]  Secondly, has your elitist friend, the new Mr. X, talked about what's going on in Japan with Fukushima and the whole nuclear disaster?
[02:04:26.267 --> 02:04:33.250]  And then finally, with gold and silver, what's going on with CarMax and the way silver has skyrocketed to $39 an ounce?
[02:04:33.250 --> 02:04:42.214]  And Alex, if you could ask Max how this is going to affect once silver is near the pinnacle of JPMorgan's chase stock price, which is at $46.
[02:04:43.783 --> 02:04:47.245]  All right, I'll bring that up with Kaiser when he joins us in about 30 minutes.
[02:04:47.245 --> 02:04:52.988]  We'll have Lindsey answer those questions you just asked after the break.
[02:04:52.988 --> 02:04:54.509]  So we'll be right back.
[02:04:54.509 --> 02:04:55.910]  Stay with us.
[02:04:55.910 --> 02:04:57.131]  Lindsey Williams on the other side.
[02:05:02.054 --> 02:05:06.075]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:05:06.075 --> 02:05:09.316]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:05:09.316 --> 02:05:14.117]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[02:05:14.117 --> 02:05:20.499]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:05:20.499 --> 02:05:22.740]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:05:23.280 --> 02:05:24.760]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:05:24.760 --> 02:05:25.861]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:05:25.861 --> 02:05:28.301]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:05:42.185 --> 02:05:44.046]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[02:05:44.046 --> 02:05:49.470]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:05:49.470 --> 02:05:58.576]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:06:00.629 --> 02:06:05.171]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:06:05.171 --> 02:06:06.072]  Number 1.
[02:06:06.072 --> 02:06:09.514]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:06:09.514 --> 02:06:10.374]  Number 2.
[02:06:10.374 --> 02:06:15.257]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:06:15.257 --> 02:06:16.017]  It's true.
[02:06:16.017 --> 02:06:20.880]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:06:20.880 --> 02:06:21.700]  Number 3.
[02:06:21.700 --> 02:06:25.282]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:06:25.282 --> 02:06:28.984]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:06:29.184 --> 02:06:29.984]  Number 4.
[02:06:29.984 --> 02:06:32.745]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:06:32.745 --> 02:06:36.427]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:06:36.427 --> 02:06:37.207]  Number 5.
[02:06:37.207 --> 02:06:41.369]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:06:41.369 --> 02:06:46.411]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:06:46.411 --> 02:06:50.592]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:06:50.592 --> 02:06:52.373]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:06:52.373 --> 02:06:56.975]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com, or call 1-866-422-9000.
[02:07:00.416 --> 02:07:01.557]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:07:01.557 --> 02:07:08.499]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:07:08.499 --> 02:07:11.060]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:07:11.060 --> 02:07:16.442]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:07:16.442 --> 02:07:19.483]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:07:19.483 --> 02:07:21.544]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:07:21.784 --> 02:07:28.048]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:07:28.048 --> 02:07:31.430]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:07:31.430 --> 02:07:37.213]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:07:37.213 --> 02:07:38.854]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:07:38.854 --> 02:07:40.135]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:07:40.135 --> 02:07:42.816]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:07:42.816 --> 02:07:44.237]  He explains everything you need to know.
[02:07:44.497 --> 02:07:47.018]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:07:47.018 --> 02:07:51.659]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:07:51.659 --> 02:07:54.239]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[02:07:54.239 --> 02:07:58.100]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:07:58.100 --> 02:08:01.181]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:08:01.181 --> 02:08:03.941]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:08:03.941 --> 02:08:06.742]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:22.014 --> 02:08:25.076]  Ron Paul is calling for investigations of the U.S.
[02:08:25.076 --> 02:08:26.297]  Mint.
[02:08:26.297 --> 02:08:29.219]  The Federal Reserve, a lot more set to do that tomorrow in Congress.
[02:08:29.219 --> 02:08:33.021]  Max Keiser coming up in about 22 minutes to go over this breaking news with us.
[02:08:33.021 --> 02:08:36.103]  We're almost out of time with Lindsey Williams.
[02:08:36.103 --> 02:08:42.367]  It's clear we're going to have to have him back up on air with us next week for part two of this.
[02:08:42.367 --> 02:08:45.849]  But I got lost in the mix exactly what Julio's first question was.
[02:08:45.849 --> 02:08:46.309]  I do remember
[02:08:47.430 --> 02:08:51.533]  He has a question for Max Keiser I will bring up.
[02:08:51.533 --> 02:08:53.515]  But let's go ahead and talk to Bobby in Florida.
[02:08:53.515 --> 02:08:57.057]  Bobby, you're on the air with Lindsey Williams.
[02:08:57.057 --> 02:08:57.377]  Great.
[02:08:57.377 --> 02:08:59.099]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:08:59.099 --> 02:09:02.441]  Long-time monthly member, first-time caller.
[02:09:02.441 --> 02:09:09.566]  I own a small recycling yard in Florida and taking a lot of advice on the gold and silver.
[02:09:09.566 --> 02:09:15.010]  But in our poor economy, I've had a lot of people asking me what a backup may be.
[02:09:16.214 --> 02:09:19.756]  And I kind of would like to get Lindsey's thought on copper.
[02:09:19.756 --> 02:09:25.519]  I keep telling people copper pennies for maybe two and back will probably be worth dollars someday.
[02:09:25.519 --> 02:09:33.023]  Yeah, that's something you can get out of general pennies, and people don't know that they're worth a lot more, the old pennies, than the new ones, and you can cash those in.
[02:09:33.023 --> 02:09:37.085]  But all commodities, as the dollars devalued, historically will go up.
[02:09:37.085 --> 02:09:37.365]  Lindsey?
[02:09:38.393 --> 02:09:42.895]  The only reason that gold and silver is going to continue to escalate and probably never stop.
[02:09:42.895 --> 02:09:47.637]  You think $3,000 an ounce for gold is going to be high.
[02:09:47.637 --> 02:09:48.837]  You haven't seen anything.
[02:09:48.837 --> 02:09:52.118]  After they put in the new world currency, they'll continue to take it up.
[02:09:52.118 --> 02:09:59.101]  The reason that's going is because they want to back it, back the new world currency with something that is tangible, gold and silver.
[02:09:59.221 --> 02:10:02.402]  And by the way, the IMF and World Bank have talked about this new global currency.
[02:10:02.402 --> 02:10:04.362]  You'll still have your local currencies.
[02:10:04.362 --> 02:10:12.385]  They'll just be denominated and controlled by this private central bank of the world that Newsweek has written about, and they say it'll be partially gold-backed.
[02:10:12.385 --> 02:10:14.465]  So, you're correct there as well, Lindsey.
[02:10:14.465 --> 02:10:16.286]  Bobby, anything else?
[02:10:16.286 --> 02:10:22.047]  Also, yeah, I'd like to catch Lindsey's idea on the government poised for the shutdown.
[02:10:22.047 --> 02:10:23.108]  You think this is a
[02:10:24.815 --> 02:10:28.148]  Something headed into just a move for their elitism.
[02:10:28.148 --> 02:10:30.316]  It's another stunt to keep spending high, Lindsey.
[02:10:31.092 --> 02:10:42.154]  Yeah, the elite have, okay, the gentleman just earlier in the program called and said, you said something about the price of crude oil going to a certain place by a certain date.
[02:10:42.154 --> 02:10:52.477]  The elite have had to, should I say this, they'll go up to $4 a gallon, they'll come back to $3.80, they'll go up to $4.25.
[02:10:52.477 --> 02:10:56.658]  They've had to go back and forth on this in order to keep the American people from waking up.
[02:10:56.658 --> 02:10:57.478]  They throttled it!
[02:10:58.278 --> 02:11:01.480]  One thing about the elite, they do not want the American people to wake up.
[02:11:01.480 --> 02:11:04.581]  They do not want anarchy.
[02:11:04.581 --> 02:11:09.164]  They want a slow frog in the pot boiling sort of a situation.
[02:11:09.164 --> 02:11:10.905]  So this is the reason that they do this.
[02:11:10.905 --> 02:11:12.045]  Alright Bobby, thank you.
[02:11:12.045 --> 02:11:13.946]  We got to move quick now to get to all these callers.
[02:11:13.946 --> 02:11:17.508]  But that's something else in October you told me that was really creepy because I don't
[02:11:17.628 --> 02:11:20.934]  Really even like being on their radar, because I know they're dangerous people.
[02:11:20.934 --> 02:11:28.006]  You said that your sources, both known to yours truly, said that this radio show is definitely on the radar?
[02:11:28.956 --> 02:11:32.379]  We're definitely watching you, Alex.
[02:11:32.379 --> 02:11:36.903]  You know, two times over these past 35 years, they've contacted me and threatened me.
[02:11:36.903 --> 02:11:43.128]  They haven't done that to you yet, fortunately, and I don't think they will, because the last... Oh, please, you've got to see this.
[02:11:43.128 --> 02:11:47.052]  The last thing I've been told... I've been told this by Mr. Fromm before he passed away.
[02:11:47.052 --> 02:11:49.574]  The last thing to go in America is going to be talk radio.
[02:11:50.274 --> 02:11:50.834]  Oh boy.
[02:11:50.834 --> 02:11:52.455]  Janice in Michigan, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:12:14.517 --> 02:12:17.119]  Thank you, it's an honor to talk to both of you.
[02:12:17.119 --> 02:12:22.663]  And, um, Lindsey, we even show your films in our Sunday School class.
[02:12:22.663 --> 02:12:25.725]  For the Prophecy class.
[02:12:25.725 --> 02:12:33.070]  And, um, you know, I've been telling my friends that when GM was going under, they're saying, they're going down, they're going down, they're bankrupt, they're going bankrupt.
[02:12:33.070 --> 02:12:35.852]  And I said, this is planned, this is a takedown.
[02:12:35.852 --> 02:12:37.273]  This is a government takeover.
[02:12:37.273 --> 02:12:39.655]  I called it, and they made fun of me.
[02:12:39.655 --> 02:12:40.796]  When we went into Egypt,
[02:12:42.344 --> 02:12:47.247]  I said, when all this was going on in Egypt, they called me a Mubarak supporter.
[02:12:47.247 --> 02:12:48.508]  Thanks a lot, you know?
[02:12:48.508 --> 02:13:02.618]  I mean, these are patriotic friends that supposedly accused me of being a... And I told them this was a planned, staged thing, and that it was going to spread throughout the Middle East because I listen to you and I know what's going on.
[02:13:02.618 --> 02:13:03.258]  I can see it.
[02:13:03.258 --> 02:13:05.179]  I know how to interpret the news.
[02:13:05.179 --> 02:13:08.762]  And I'm just so thankful for you today to be saying this.
[02:13:09.366 --> 02:13:25.095]  And this is all staged, and I would like to ask Ron Paul about the Tea Parties and have you and Alex talk more about this because they've been taking over, or the Republican Party is all it is, and Ron Paul's the one that started the Tea Parties.
[02:13:25.095 --> 02:13:28.257]  But my question to you, Lindsay, is about the stock market.
[02:13:28.257 --> 02:13:32.359]  Do you have any news on what would happen to the stock market as the dollar falls?
[02:13:33.001 --> 02:13:39.265]  The Plunge Protection Team is going to keep the stock market up as long as they possibly want it there.
[02:13:39.265 --> 02:13:44.849]  And the only reason it's staying there is because of the Plunge Protection Team that comes to its rescue every day.
[02:13:44.849 --> 02:13:49.212]  By the way, I feel honored that you would show my film, Skid Row, Sunday School Class.
[02:13:49.212 --> 02:13:51.593]  This is appreciative of me.
[02:13:51.593 --> 02:13:56.857]  Now, every single one of you, you, me, all of us are thankful to Alex Jones.
[02:13:56.857 --> 02:14:00.179]  Do you realize that none of this message could get out were it not for Alex's program?
[02:14:00.419 --> 02:14:05.584]  Lindsay, you know, I appreciate that and we appreciate you, but we've got to hurry to the next caller, but I'm just doing my duty.
[02:14:05.584 --> 02:14:06.645]  Thank you so much, sir.
[02:14:06.645 --> 02:14:07.946]  Thank you, Janice.
[02:14:07.946 --> 02:14:08.867]  Jack in Illinois.
[02:14:08.867 --> 02:14:10.749]  Got to move really quick now to get to everybody.
[02:14:10.749 --> 02:14:11.529]  Jack, you're on the air.
[02:14:11.529 --> 02:14:13.331]  Hey, Alex.
[02:14:13.331 --> 02:14:15.213]  Lindsay, I certainly respect your work.
[02:14:15.213 --> 02:14:19.216]  Let's go back to the BP Gulf oil disaster for a moment.
[02:14:19.216 --> 02:14:25.602]  What's your take on the reason the tsunami did not occur as you, Richard Hoagland, and others predicted?
[02:14:25.990 --> 02:14:35.012]  And then also, what do you feel is the actual state of danger in the Gulf region today due to the oil spill and the use of the toxic coal?
[02:14:35.012 --> 02:14:36.033]  Yeah, I know.
[02:14:36.033 --> 02:14:39.914]  That's the only thing that these guys have told him that did not come true.
[02:14:39.914 --> 02:14:46.976]  And at the time, that was speculation by these elitists that a methane explosion could happen and could trigger a tsunami.
[02:14:46.976 --> 02:14:50.757]  And I personally pooh-poohed that myself.
[02:14:50.757 --> 02:14:53.297]  But, Lindsey, quickly, and I appreciate your call, Jack.
[02:14:53.297 --> 02:14:54.498]  I've got to let you go.
[02:14:54.498 --> 02:14:55.158]  We're almost out of time.
[02:14:55.558 --> 02:15:02.167]  When they hit this super deep well in the Gulf of Mexico, they knew that they could not control it.
[02:15:02.167 --> 02:15:03.869]  They did not know what was going to happen.
[02:15:03.869 --> 02:15:09.276]  They knew if they used a nuclear device that it could possibly rupture that strata.
[02:15:14.167 --> 02:15:27.601]  Yes, and they knew that there was a possibility of this, and when those people were giving me, some insiders in BP were giving me every detail of what was happening in the Gulf, they said, this could possibly happen, people better watch out just in case it does.
[02:15:27.601 --> 02:15:32.086]  But, of course it did not, and I think even they were glad that it didn't, or they would have been in big trouble.
[02:15:32.446 --> 02:15:34.569]  Yeah, that's different from a globalist policy.
[02:15:34.569 --> 02:15:36.531]  Oh, I remember what the last caller wanted to know.
[02:15:36.531 --> 02:15:49.567]  He wanted to know if the tsunami could have been staged, and then during the break you were talking to me before we forgot what the question was, and you were saying the elitists told you that no, that was not a staged event, that was not a bombing of the nuclear power plant.
[02:15:50.311 --> 02:15:55.493]  No, now the elitists did not tell me that they did not have anything to do with the tsunami.
[02:15:55.493 --> 02:15:57.194]  Oh yeah, misunderstood you.
[02:15:57.194 --> 02:16:03.156]  ...in Japan, but from what I gather, from what they have said, is they only want to touch the subject.
[02:16:03.156 --> 02:16:05.818]  I don't think personally that they had anything to do with it.
[02:16:05.818 --> 02:16:18.223]  I think it was a natural disaster, but they definitely have not indicated to me that they had anything to do with it whatsoever through HAARP and the scalar waves.
[02:16:18.803 --> 02:16:22.184]  Okay, well, I misunderstood you during the quick break, then, because I had other people talking in my ear.
[02:16:22.184 --> 02:16:30.666]  Lindsey, to recap, the globalists are going to try to overthrow all the Arab dictatorships and fiefdoms of these royalty.
[02:16:30.666 --> 02:16:33.267]  They're going to continue jacking up the prices.
[02:16:33.267 --> 02:16:44.589]  I'm going to definitely have the producers put you on hold right now and set you up for another hour sometime next week when it's good for you for part two of this, because there's so much more we need to go over and more calls we need to take.
[02:16:44.589 --> 02:16:46.110]  God bless you, and thank you for joining us.
[02:16:46.110 --> 02:16:46.930]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[02:16:47.608 --> 02:16:48.188]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:16:48.188 --> 02:16:48.769]  Have a great day.
[02:17:07.879 --> 02:17:22.548]  So much is going on, so much is happening right now, and I've got a smattering of other news I need to hit on before Max Keiser joins us, getting into Ron Paul's investigation he's launching tomorrow.
[02:17:22.548 --> 02:17:24.289]  This is a big deal.
[02:17:24.289 --> 02:17:31.153]  Also, Ron Paul says gold commodity prices signify the triggering of the big event, signaling economic collapse.
[02:17:31.153 --> 02:17:32.173]  That's at Infowars.com.
[02:17:33.334 --> 02:17:40.441]  The Drudge Report has our report linked on the right-hand side dealing with Paul saying he'll probably announce in the next month to run for president.
[02:17:40.441 --> 02:17:42.543]  That's big news all over the country.
[02:17:42.543 --> 02:17:46.087]  Very pleased that that was announced here.
[02:17:46.087 --> 02:17:47.688]  We do have gold right now.
[02:17:47.688 --> 02:17:49.430]  Well, let's bring Ted Anderson up briefly.
[02:17:49.430 --> 02:17:51.432]  Ted, what's the latest numbers on gold and silver?
[02:17:52.452 --> 02:17:53.654]  Well, right now gold is at $14.5910.
[02:17:53.654 --> 02:17:54.535]  Seen a high today of $14.6370.
[02:17:54.535 --> 02:17:55.756]  Silver's the big gainer, however.
[02:17:55.756 --> 02:17:58.099]  Right now, currently $39.46, but had a high today of $39.79.
[02:17:58.099 --> 02:18:00.923]  Alex, I think we're going to see $40 an ounce silver here very soon.
[02:18:09.457 --> 02:18:13.963]  It's been a big day in trading and my goodness is it ever short in supply.
[02:18:13.963 --> 02:18:17.247]  Try to get a US Eagle out there, a Silver Eagle.
[02:18:17.247 --> 02:18:23.215]  I'm having to beg and plead with a lot of my wholesalers and dealers and so on and so forth.
[02:18:23.215 --> 02:18:24.137]  I need to buy this stuff.
[02:18:24.437 --> 02:18:36.506]  I've been in business 32 years, 14 with Midas, and the good news is you've got a supply, you've got a list of those, and discounted on that list when people call and say it's the Alex Jones Radio Special.
[02:18:36.506 --> 02:18:42.230]  Now, did you have to go up from the $110 for the three silver dollars, the free shipping, and three of my films?
[02:18:42.230 --> 02:18:43.011]  Have you had to go up?
[02:18:43.371 --> 02:18:45.754]  Well, I've held that one, Alex, right now.
[02:18:45.754 --> 02:18:51.901]  The only thing I've increased on that sheet that we talked about yesterday on was The Creature from Jekyll Island and Silver Dollar.
[02:18:51.901 --> 02:18:54.043]  I have that at $41 now.
[02:18:54.043 --> 02:18:57.447]  For those of you who picked that up, I hope to goodness that you'll read that book.
[02:18:58.268 --> 02:19:05.074]  Silver dollar basically at cost with a free $20 book on top of it, so that is a move of $9 increase.
[02:19:05.074 --> 02:19:15.783]  You're saying you're holding the three silver dollars, free shipping, the silver dollars below spot, the free shipping, and the three of my films, best-selling films on top of it.
[02:19:15.783 --> 02:19:20.287]  Now where silver's at, that's over an $80 discount.
[02:19:20.287 --> 02:19:22.369]  No one can beat that deal on silver dollars alone.
[02:19:22.369 --> 02:19:22.909]  That's $31 a piece, Ted.
[02:19:24.190 --> 02:19:28.073]  I know, and I know that there isn't a single dealer in the entire world that has them for less than that.
[02:19:28.073 --> 02:19:30.554]  Plus, you get the videos to go with it.
[02:19:30.554 --> 02:19:33.957]  You know, all I can say, Alex, is that let's get these videos out in the hands of people.
[02:19:33.957 --> 02:19:44.383]  Yeah, but Ted, Ted, I mean, it's like you still have silver that you bought at the lower price, but I thought you were going to change this.
[02:19:44.383 --> 02:19:44.604]  800-686-2237.
[02:19:44.604 --> 02:19:45.284]  800-686-2237.
[02:19:45.284 --> 02:19:48.066]  Ted, come back and explain to me, because I haven't talked to you yet today.
[02:19:48.066 --> 02:19:49.947]  Explain to me how you're able to do this.
[02:19:51.508 --> 02:19:56.849]  How long your supplies are going to last, or are you selling silver you just bought at this price and losing money?
[02:19:56.849 --> 02:20:01.050]  We'll be right back.
[02:20:01.050 --> 02:20:03.151]  Daddy, I'm hungry.
[02:20:03.151 --> 02:20:05.472]  That little girl will get fed, for now.
[02:20:05.472 --> 02:20:08.592]  But what if people like Glenn Beck are right about the threats we face?
[02:20:08.592 --> 02:20:09.132]  If the U.S.
[02:20:09.132 --> 02:20:14.614]  dollar loses its status as the global reserve currency, prices on the things you need most will skyrocket.
[02:20:14.614 --> 02:20:17.355]  Food may be unaffordable, or worse, unavailable.
[02:20:17.355 --> 02:20:18.935]  Earthquakes, economic turmoil,
[02:20:19.235 --> 02:20:28.302]  Continuing unemployment, rampant inflation, and even threats of terrorism are all reasons to let the experts at Ready Reserve Foods help you with a long-term food storage plan.
[02:20:28.302 --> 02:20:33.405]  Ready Reserve Foods has been a premier supplier of long-term storage foods for 37 years.

[02:22:02.853 --> 02:22:05.174]  Alex Jones here with key information.
[02:22:05.174 --> 02:22:05.754]  The U.S.
[02:22:05.754 --> 02:22:13.038]  government is a Ponzi scheme that relies on the Treasury continuously selling large amounts of government bonds to foreign central banks.
[02:22:13.038 --> 02:22:15.739]  With Japan about to become a seller of U.S.
[02:22:15.739 --> 02:22:19.060]  bonds in order to rebuild its own nation, and the U.S.
[02:22:19.060 --> 02:22:25.724]  antagonizing China by calling them currency manipulators, the Federal Reserve, which is already buying about 70% of U.S.
[02:22:25.724 --> 02:22:28.365]  Treasuries, will soon be the only buyer left of U.S.
[02:22:28.365 --> 02:22:28.825]  Treasuries.
[02:22:29.225 --> 02:22:32.747]  Our friends at the National Inflation Association believe that the U.S.
[02:22:32.747 --> 02:22:38.691]  dollar will soon become worthless and Americans will see the purchasing power of their incomes and savings destroyed.
[02:22:38.691 --> 02:22:47.157]  I strongly urge my fellow Americans to sign up for the free NIA newsletter at www.inflation.us.

[02:24:04.667 --> 02:24:08.130]  By the way, Kurt Nemo did a great job last night getting a quick report out.
[02:24:08.130 --> 02:24:11.093]  Ron Paul to announce presidential bid next month.
[02:24:11.093 --> 02:24:24.046]  But then this morning, I was re-listening to the 20-minute interview we did with him live yesterday, and he actually said, I'm going to announce in the next month or maybe even sooner, because in the next few weeks he's going to announce whether he's going to be in the presidential debate.
[02:24:24.046 --> 02:24:26.288]  He said he tentatively is probably going to do that.
[02:24:26.288 --> 02:24:29.010]  And his son said, yes, I expect him to run, Rand Paul.
[02:24:30.491 --> 02:24:33.592]  He's running and but Drudge actually got it right.
[02:24:33.592 --> 02:24:45.476]  His headline is Ron Paul to announce in weeks because technically he said within weeks or at least within the next month and the Drudge Report has that link up on DrudgeReport.com
[02:24:47.017 --> 02:24:48.978]  Let me actually pull up the headline here.
[02:24:48.978 --> 02:24:51.799]  Ron Paul to announce presidential run in weeks.
[02:24:51.799 --> 02:24:56.541]  And then that links over to our article at Infowars.com.
[02:24:56.541 --> 02:24:59.962]  And we have an updated article now posted at the top of that story.
[02:24:59.962 --> 02:25:05.824]  Ron Paul, gold commodity prices, big event signaling economic collapse.
[02:25:05.824 --> 02:25:08.705]  And again, he agreed the globalists have engineered this.
[02:25:08.705 --> 02:25:10.286]  And now we're going to try to get even more power.
[02:25:11.686 --> 02:25:15.247]  out of it in that process.
[02:25:15.247 --> 02:25:20.389]  Ted Anderson, talking to you about this right now, and I want to get back into the gold and silver offers.
[02:25:20.389 --> 02:25:22.249]  I could say buy gold and silver from Midas.
[02:25:22.249 --> 02:25:27.631]  It's the sister company of Genesis, and that's how you started this whole thing.
[02:25:27.631 --> 02:25:33.993]  But at the same time, I can't even really say it supports the network or you or me, because I happen to know.
[02:25:33.993 --> 02:25:39.095]  But I know you bought a megaload of silver and gold, and then when it goes up, you sell it at the old price.
[02:25:39.775 --> 02:25:40.356]  We're good to go.
[02:26:03.049 --> 02:26:07.092]  Let's put it this way Alex, I'm not making money on them, I'll tell you that.
[02:26:07.092 --> 02:26:13.157]  But I can tell you, I'll also tell you this, I think it's so important to get those videos out in people's hands.
[02:26:13.157 --> 02:26:15.059]  I will raise those prices too, I just have to.
[02:26:15.743 --> 02:26:19.506]  The creature from Jekyll Island was so far distorted, I couldn't help it.
[02:26:19.506 --> 02:26:21.047]  I had to go.
[02:26:21.047 --> 02:26:30.414]  You were losing about 50% on that, because of a silver dollar costing you $39, and then a book that retails for $24, you're getting them on over about $15.
[02:26:30.414 --> 02:26:35.217]  So $40 and $15, $55, and you were selling that for $31, correct?
[02:26:35.217 --> 02:26:36.598]  Yeah, don't forget I have to put them into a...
[02:26:37.739 --> 02:26:43.123]  Priority envelope to and that's you know, that's about six, but you gotta pay to ship it You got to have your people pack it.
[02:26:43.123 --> 02:26:47.567]  So I mean folks when I say these are insanely good deals They are it's still a great deal.
[02:26:47.567 --> 02:26:51.790]  How much is the creature in a silver dollar now 41 bucks?
[02:26:51.790 --> 02:26:53.632]  Try to just buy a silver dollar for that.
[02:26:53.632 --> 02:26:56.074]  I mean you're not gonna get it delivered to you for 41 bucks.
[02:26:56.074 --> 02:26:56.094]  I
[02:26:56.294 --> 02:26:57.915]  Well, that's still a fabulous deal.
[02:26:57.915 --> 02:27:02.938]  Now, there's a grab bag of limited supplies of different gold and silver coins, silver half-dollars.
[02:27:02.938 --> 02:27:05.699]  As long as you say it's the radio special, you'll get the older price.
[02:27:05.699 --> 02:27:07.040]  The current one is great.
[02:27:07.040 --> 02:27:08.761]  They got it on the website, but this is better.
[02:27:08.761 --> 02:27:11.223]  What's a grab bag of some of the other stuff you've got?
[02:27:11.223 --> 02:27:15.025]  Well, we have bags of dimes, what we call survival bags of dimes.
[02:27:15.025 --> 02:27:20.108]  They're sitting in the $2,800 range.
[02:27:20.108 --> 02:27:22.529]  If you're looking for gold, the Frank is a great buy.
[02:27:22.529 --> 02:27:23.290]  British Sovereign's $390.
[02:27:24.577 --> 02:27:26.640]  You know, there's Walking Liberty halves.
[02:27:26.640 --> 02:27:28.081]  I'm going to have to raise that price, too.
[02:27:28.081 --> 02:27:29.723]  Right now it's $18.08.
[02:27:29.723 --> 02:27:35.190]  Man, it was $8.08 here just about a year ago, it seems, when we were talking about those.
[02:27:35.190 --> 02:27:37.833]  I mean, everything's just going out of this world.
[02:27:37.833 --> 02:27:41.897]  Alex, I don't know if you know this or not, but supplies right now are so tight.
[02:27:42.598 --> 02:27:43.299]  Uh, the U.S.
[02:27:43.299 --> 02:27:46.001]  Mint isn't making enough Silver Eagles to go around.
[02:27:46.001 --> 02:27:48.562]  It's hard for people to fill IRAs right now.
[02:27:48.562 --> 02:27:50.364]  And you know what the weird part about it is?
[02:27:50.364 --> 02:27:55.788]  Is Von Knothaus is going to prison, and the people that have been running the Fed are going to walk free.
[02:27:55.788 --> 02:27:58.510]  It's just, everything's so turned around upside down.
[02:27:58.510 --> 02:27:59.851]  It's just driving me crazy.
[02:27:59.851 --> 02:28:06.576]  And it comes out that Wachovia and Wells Fargo, laundering $370 plus billion, didn't even get in trouble.
[02:28:08.577 --> 02:28:13.099]  I mean, this is just, it's just incredible that that's what this country and this world has come to.
[02:28:13.099 --> 02:28:16.361]  People need to protect themselves with gold and silver to get a hold of these specials.
[02:28:16.361 --> 02:28:16.601]  800-686-2237.
[02:28:16.601 --> 02:28:16.921]  800-686-2237.
[02:28:16.921 --> 02:28:22.524]  Again, 800-686-2237.
[02:28:22.524 --> 02:28:28.787]  And Ted's just too busy to go up on prices, and they'll still be a great deal.
[02:28:28.787 --> 02:28:30.047]  But he went up on one of them.
[02:28:30.047 --> 02:28:31.848]  He'll go up on the other very soon.
[02:28:31.848 --> 02:28:33.549]  When do you think you're going to go up on the other one, Ted?
[02:28:33.829 --> 02:28:37.370]  You know, I'm hoping to be able to make it at least to this weekend, but I'll see.
[02:28:37.370 --> 02:28:44.932]  I have to watch what I'm doing here because, you know, the prices are just rising so fast in silver, it's just hard to keep up with my offers, you know?
[02:28:44.932 --> 02:28:48.273]  I have to change my TV commercials, radio commercials.
[02:28:48.273 --> 02:28:53.134]  There's so much I have to do, but it's just running like crazy, and that's the way it's going to be.
[02:28:53.134 --> 02:28:57.255]  The dollar's dropping like a stone in a lake, and, you know, that's just the way it is.
[02:28:57.255 --> 02:29:02.917]  What do you think of the exciting fact that Ron Paul pretty much said he was going to announce in the next month to run for president?
[02:29:03.297 --> 02:29:05.998]  Well, you know that there's nobody that wants that more than me.
[02:29:05.998 --> 02:29:10.038]  I just can't wait to start flying those banners I did last time around.
[02:29:10.038 --> 02:29:12.939]  I mean, I am just all pumped up and ready to go with that.
[02:29:12.939 --> 02:29:14.079]  Yeah, you were funding blimps.
[02:29:14.079 --> 02:29:15.720]  You had airplanes up all over the country.
[02:29:15.720 --> 02:29:17.380]  I saw them in Austin.
[02:29:17.380 --> 02:29:18.720]  Incredible job, Ted Anderson.
[02:29:18.720 --> 02:29:21.181]  What do you think of Glenn Beck exiting Fox?
[02:29:21.181 --> 02:29:22.421]  Well, you know, that's another thing.
[02:29:22.421 --> 02:29:25.582]  Oh, we found out about that at dinner, didn't we, months ago.
[02:29:25.582 --> 02:29:29.423]  Yeah, you know, that's true.
[02:29:29.423 --> 02:29:30.423]  Oh, did we say too much?
[02:29:32.779 --> 02:29:33.459]  No, we didn't.
[02:29:33.459 --> 02:29:34.820]  We didn't say anything.
[02:29:34.820 --> 02:29:36.060]  I'm really bummed out about it.
[02:29:36.060 --> 02:29:41.922]  As bad as he is going after me behind the scenes and on air, I dislike George Soros even more.
[02:29:41.922 --> 02:29:44.522]  George Soros is going to be very pleased right now.
[02:29:44.522 --> 02:29:46.503]  Ted Anderson, thank you so much for joining us.
[02:29:46.503 --> 02:29:51.064]  We'll be back with Max Keiser and the latest Libya news.
[02:29:51.064 --> 02:29:52.464]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.464 --> 02:29:54.985]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.985 --> 02:29:57.666]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.149 --> 02:30:04.732]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[02:30:04.732 --> 02:30:06.034]  It ended on June of 2009.
[02:30:06.034 --> 02:30:10.438]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[02:30:10.438 --> 02:30:16.383]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[02:30:16.383 --> 02:30:18.525]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[02:30:18.525 --> 02:30:21.208]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[02:30:21.548 --> 02:30:28.052]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[02:30:28.052 --> 02:30:30.253]  They both make fabulous investments.
[02:30:30.253 --> 02:30:35.597]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[02:30:35.597 --> 02:30:40.880]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[02:30:40.880 --> 02:30:46.023]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long-term.
[02:30:46.243 --> 02:30:49.446]  This will freeze the cost your food while you can still afford it.

[02:30:52.448 --> 02:30:53.209]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[02:31:04.668 --> 02:31:05.929]  Tyranny is here.
[02:31:05.929 --> 02:31:09.851]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:31:09.851 --> 02:31:12.093]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:31:12.093 --> 02:31:17.956]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:31:17.956 --> 02:31:24.200]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:31:24.620 --> 02:31:30.563]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:31:30.563 --> 02:31:34.765]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:31:34.765 --> 02:31:39.068]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:31:39.068 --> 02:31:45.011]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:31:45.011 --> 02:31:48.573]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:31:48.573 --> 02:31:50.534]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:31:50.534 --> 02:31:50.974]  It's here.

[02:33:57.514 --> 02:34:00.396]  FEMA training to stop people like you.
[02:34:00.396 --> 02:34:01.556]  Key article.
[02:34:01.556 --> 02:34:02.757]  GCNLive.com.
[02:34:02.757 --> 02:34:08.520]  North Carolina SB-31 bill seeks to turn healers into felons.
[02:34:08.520 --> 02:34:11.202]  Another article at GCNLive.com from the economic collapse.
[02:34:11.202 --> 02:34:14.844]  How to find a job, just be willing to flip burgers and work for minimum wage.
[02:34:16.155 --> 02:34:26.958]  Gold hits new record at $1,460 plus an ounce and just incredible information on that front.
[02:34:26.958 --> 02:34:34.321]  Continuing with Ron Paul, one reason Max Keiser is joining us for the last 25 minutes of the transmission here in a moment, Ron Paul to highlight
[02:34:34.741 --> 02:34:36.082]  Pet themes with U.S.
[02:34:36.082 --> 02:34:37.123]  Mint hearing.
[02:34:37.123 --> 02:34:38.104]  Here's another headline.
[02:34:38.104 --> 02:34:42.308]  Silver moving towards $40 an ounce as Ron Paul to investigate the U.S.
[02:34:42.308 --> 02:34:43.129]  Mint.
[02:34:43.129 --> 02:34:47.533]  And Kaiser is here to discuss that with us and a lot more.
[02:34:47.533 --> 02:34:51.136]  The Saudi government saying oil to hit $200 to $300 a barrel.
[02:34:51.136 --> 02:34:53.699]  Basically give the globalists try to overthrow them.
[02:34:53.699 --> 02:34:54.620]  That's out of Reuters.
[02:34:56.378 --> 02:35:11.711]  Also, the New York Times, USA Today, The Hill, Politico all picked up Ron Paul's interview here yesterday saying, yeah, he's pretty much going to announce in the next month whether he's going to run or not, and that he's putting a token in that he's going to probably go ahead and be part of the debate.
[02:35:11.711 --> 02:35:12.752]  So he's running, folks.
[02:35:12.752 --> 02:35:14.634]  You heard it here first.
[02:35:14.634 --> 02:35:16.936]  Big news across the country.
[02:35:16.936 --> 02:35:21.019]  We appreciate Matt Drudge for linking it as well at DrudgeReport.com.
[02:35:21.019 --> 02:35:23.862]  Now, here's the latest Libya news before we go to Max Keiser.
[02:35:24.142 --> 02:35:32.869]  Gaddafi in letter asked Obama to end airstrikes says you are a man who has enough courage to annul a wrong and mistake taken.
[02:35:32.869 --> 02:35:36.452]  He went on to say we were under attack by Al Qaeda forces as you know.
[02:35:36.452 --> 02:35:38.033]  Why are you backing the terrorist network?
[02:35:38.033 --> 02:35:42.436]  He's been saying that for five weeks and now it's confirmed all over the news that Al Qaeda is the core.
[02:35:43.197 --> 02:35:44.338]  And rebel leaders the U.S.
[02:35:44.338 --> 02:35:49.400]  is backing are people that sent Mujahideen, as they call them, in to Iraq to kill U.S.
[02:35:49.400 --> 02:36:00.887]  soldiers, and you're called anti-military, anti-American if you don't worship al-Qaeda now, and if you don't like Amir al-Awlaki hanging out secretly at the Pentagon, number two in al-Qaeda, number one if you believe the New York Times.
[02:36:00.887 --> 02:36:03.708]  I mean, we're supposed to just ignore all this like we're idiots.
[02:36:05.868 --> 02:36:14.789]  Because it's too scary with the comfort bubble, or, oh what's that term, people have this normalcy bias where
[02:36:16.095 --> 02:36:17.416]  I heard Beck talking about this.
[02:36:17.416 --> 02:36:19.497]  We've talked about it a lot, but I'm glad he was telling some truth.
[02:36:19.497 --> 02:36:25.399]  Now, unfortunately, getting a show on Fox phased out, but he was saying people on the Titanic just went back to their state rooms.
[02:36:25.399 --> 02:36:29.361]  This, we couldn't be sinking, even as it was listing at a 45 degree angle.
[02:36:29.361 --> 02:36:31.902]  Uh, people on 911 said, I'm going back to my office.
[02:36:31.902 --> 02:36:33.183]  I'm going to go turn my computer off.
[02:36:33.183 --> 02:36:35.104]  They'd go up 20 floors and die.
[02:36:35.104 --> 02:36:36.604]  And, and we're here breaking this down.
[02:36:36.604 --> 02:36:38.785]  This doesn't have to happen.
[02:36:38.785 --> 02:36:41.427]  We don't have to go over this cliff.
[02:36:41.427 --> 02:36:41.647]  And, uh,
[02:36:43.580 --> 02:36:50.649]  It shows that the globalists are really moving into their endgame, but we've been prepared for this warning, people being laughed at for decades.
[02:36:50.649 --> 02:36:53.072]  Now people aren't laughing, they're really listening everywhere I go.
[02:36:54.500 --> 02:36:59.665]  Bigwigs, mainline business people that laughed at me years ago, run up and say, you're right, this is really happening.
[02:36:59.665 --> 02:37:04.350]  People that don't even know who I am are talking about the collapse coming, the Federal Reserve engineering it.
[02:37:04.350 --> 02:37:11.557]  Wall Street and its criminal activities, its non-free market vertical integration of the economy through government controls is really being exposed.
[02:37:11.557 --> 02:37:16.002]  They're trying to make us fight with each other via the left-right paradigm, but more and more it's not working.
[02:37:16.582 --> 02:37:28.106]  And now is the time to scream bloody murder and get this information out like never before, because the quickening is here, the acceleration, the amplification is here, and people have never been more ready to hear the truth.
[02:37:28.106 --> 02:37:28.946]  So it's on.
[02:37:28.946 --> 02:37:31.647]  We're in the New World Order, toe-to-toe with the globalists.
[02:37:31.647 --> 02:37:33.247]  We gotta fight and chance.
[02:37:33.247 --> 02:37:39.069]  They just want to arrogantly throw all this in our face, hide it in plain view, and think that we'll just go along with it.
[02:37:39.069 --> 02:37:40.710]  We gotta break the trance.
[02:37:40.710 --> 02:37:40.850]  Now,
[02:37:41.860 --> 02:37:42.981]  Max Keiser joins us.
[02:37:42.981 --> 02:37:48.466]  He's the inventor of the Hollywood Stock Exchange virtual trading system used in major stock markets worldwide.
[02:37:48.466 --> 02:37:51.249]  A very successful retired stock broker in his own right.
[02:37:51.249 --> 02:37:58.035]  Journalist with the BBC, RT, Al Jazeera, Press TV, Genesis on Saturday mornings.
[02:37:58.035 --> 02:37:58.876]  You name it, he does it.
[02:37:58.876 --> 02:38:00.638]  MaxKeiser.com.
[02:38:00.638 --> 02:38:03.781]  And we wanted to get Max on to talk about what Ron Paul's doing.
[02:38:03.781 --> 02:38:05.222]  His move for investigations.
[02:38:07.364 --> 02:38:11.086]  Testimony he's going to be leading tomorrow in the house.
[02:38:11.086 --> 02:38:13.307]  What's happening with Silver?
[02:38:13.307 --> 02:38:15.369]  It's on, as Max said to me during the break.
[02:38:15.369 --> 02:38:17.470]  Max Keiser, break down what you see happening.
[02:38:18.550 --> 02:38:20.151]  Well, we've totally got him.
[02:38:20.151 --> 02:38:22.811]  We've totally got him, Alex.
[02:38:22.811 --> 02:38:28.053]  And this Bernie Vaughn, not House, case is that J.P.
[02:38:28.053 --> 02:38:31.334]  Morgan is totally desperate.
[02:38:31.334 --> 02:38:37.256]  Their stock price now is directly under assault by the rising price of silver.
[02:38:37.256 --> 02:38:44.979]  And tomorrow, of course, is the 7th of April, 4-7, which is the atomic number of silver
[02:38:45.539 --> 02:38:52.324]  And this is the formal recognition of the Silver Liberation Army, the SLA.
[02:38:52.324 --> 02:38:56.386]  And that is one of the best ideas for a Google bomb I ever heard.
[02:38:56.386 --> 02:39:05.252]  The Silver Liberation Army is going to take all the silver off the market necessary to completely bankrupt the banksters.
[02:39:05.252 --> 02:39:09.735]  This Bernie Von Nuthouse case, you know, JPM is in the nuthouse.
[02:39:09.735 --> 02:39:11.797]  They're going to put JPMorgan in the nuthouse.
[02:39:11.797 --> 02:39:15.299]  It's absolutely outrageous that they would go after this guy.
[02:39:15.659 --> 02:39:20.262]  By the way, it's pronounced note house, he corrected me, but I guess you can call it nut house if you want.
[02:39:20.262 --> 02:39:27.767]  But, you know, the issue here is even the Wall Street Journal, even AP said this makes regular barter illegal.
[02:39:27.767 --> 02:39:35.752]  They didn't even have a law, they just had a servile jury who probably have IQs below room temperature.
[02:39:36.673 --> 02:39:46.225]  Well, the 7 million in silver that they're trying to grab from citizens is directly going to be used to offset JPMorgan's short silver position.
[02:39:46.225 --> 02:39:47.887]  That's how desperate they are.
[02:39:47.887 --> 02:39:50.771]  They're scrambling for silver in the open market and they can't get it.
[02:39:50.771 --> 02:39:55.397]  You've got guys in Canada and all over the United States who are taking physical off the market.
[02:39:55.657 --> 02:39:59.760]  You're saying you believe what you launched here three, four months ago and what others picked up on.
[02:39:59.760 --> 02:40:01.841]  Tens of thousands of video sites.
[02:40:01.841 --> 02:40:07.245]  You're saying that the crash JPMorgan Buy Silver has now gone into terminal velocity.
[02:40:07.245 --> 02:40:11.148]  It's now gone into point of no return and that they are scrambling.
[02:40:11.690 --> 02:40:13.431]  Yes, because J.P.
[02:40:13.431 --> 02:40:17.054]  Morgan has put up their own stock as collateral against these shorts.
[02:40:17.054 --> 02:40:21.136]  And that means that when the price gets above $47, as you see, it's now almost $40.
[02:40:21.136 --> 02:40:22.497]  Once it gets over $47, J.P.
[02:40:22.497 --> 02:40:25.339]  Morgan is going to fall like a house of cards.
[02:40:25.339 --> 02:40:31.283]  This is going to be an unbelievable spectacle to watch, this $160 million colossus, this financial terrorist.
[02:40:31.283 --> 02:40:34.966]  The two terrorists get totally decimated right before our eyes.
[02:40:42.190 --> 02:40:42.751]  Everybody's...
[02:40:57.262 --> 02:40:57.882]  They're done!
[02:40:57.882 --> 02:40:58.522]  Alright, alright.
[02:40:58.522 --> 02:40:59.823]  I want to give you the floor.
[02:40:59.823 --> 02:41:00.903]  I want to give you the floor to go over this.
[02:41:00.903 --> 02:41:02.684]  I'm not disagreeing with you.
[02:41:02.684 --> 02:41:12.266]  Explain to people, though, that only a fraction of the silver needs to be physically held, and then that calls their bluff on their paper manipulation.
[02:41:12.266 --> 02:41:15.607]  Explain the technicals of that, and then you got the floor.
[02:41:15.607 --> 02:41:17.748]  Well, for every ounce that somebody buys of silver, J.P.
[02:41:17.748 --> 02:41:21.069]  Morgan sells 20 to 50 ounces of silver that don't exist.
[02:41:21.069 --> 02:41:22.209]  It's called naked short selling.
[02:41:22.992 --> 02:41:24.553]  That's the simple, that's the bottom line.
[02:41:24.553 --> 02:41:26.693]  They sell silver that doesn't exist, that's naked short selling.
[02:41:26.693 --> 02:41:34.196]  They've sold more than, by some estimates, 3 billion ounces short, but more than a billion, certainly, and that's the entire silver stock above ground.
[02:41:34.196 --> 02:41:38.677]  They've sold short more stock than exists above ground, and they're on the floor every day manipulating the price.
[02:41:38.677 --> 02:41:41.518]  Every time someone shows up to buy one ounce of silver, J.P.
[02:41:41.518 --> 02:41:47.760]  Morgan tried to sell 10 as a naked short sale, silver that they don't own, but at the end of the month,
[02:41:48.320 --> 02:41:49.761]  The books have to be squared.
[02:41:49.761 --> 02:41:51.743]  The COMEX has to physically deliver.
[02:41:51.743 --> 02:41:57.628]  Just a few days ago, the COMEX came once again with an inherent breath of collapsing due to physical delivery.
[02:41:57.628 --> 02:41:59.650]  Every month gets closer and closer.
[02:41:59.650 --> 02:42:13.281]  And now, with what's happening with the Silver Liberation Army, which is being launched globally around the world, we're going to take what's remaining of that silver out of the physical stock, off the physical market, and we're going to put, you know, J.P.
[02:42:13.982 --> 02:42:18.604]  By the way, that did come out when Bernanke for several years didn't want to release where the trillions in bailout went.
[02:42:18.604 --> 02:42:22.566]  A lot of it, most of it went to Europe and private corporations, but some of it did go to Qaddafi.
[02:42:34.989 --> 02:42:43.881]  Absolutely, through the back-end machinations and the financial pipelines conducted primarily by Morgan and Goldman Sachs.
[02:42:43.881 --> 02:42:49.448]  So now it's coming to the surface, but this Civil Liberation Army, this global force,
[02:42:50.189 --> 02:42:50.610]  We're good to go.
[02:43:13.270 --> 02:43:17.514]  The pirate's gonna go, and this is a fantastic wealth transfer.
[02:43:17.514 --> 02:43:19.436]  They stole our wealth.
[02:43:19.436 --> 02:43:21.217]  Now we're taking it back.
[02:43:21.217 --> 02:43:38.372]  And that gives us the wherewithal to rebuild this entire economy and rebuild this entire political system with smart people like Ron Paul in charge who can bring back all of the freedoms that people had before these gangster terrorists took them away.
[02:43:39.246 --> 02:43:42.587]  Now, how do you expect Morgan to try to stop this from happening?
[02:43:42.587 --> 02:43:46.209]  I mean, even mainstream news is now saying the Comex could default.
[02:43:46.209 --> 02:43:52.371]  You're correct on that, but what are the exact numbers that'll happen at 47?
[02:43:52.371 --> 02:43:56.192]  When do you expect that to happen, or do you think they could successfully drive it back down?
[02:43:56.192 --> 02:43:58.013]  How is the empire going to strike back?
[02:43:58.800 --> 02:44:02.261]  Well, they're going to have to choose.
[02:44:02.261 --> 02:44:03.542]  Either J.P.
[02:44:03.542 --> 02:44:11.324]  Morgan lives, or they're going to have to completely sacrifice the dollar and the Federal Reserve Bank.
[02:44:11.324 --> 02:44:13.505]  It's all going to go down the toilet anyway.
[02:44:13.505 --> 02:44:14.785]  It's all worthless.
[02:44:14.785 --> 02:44:25.989]  And if they go to the Fed, like they did in October of 2008, if they go to the Treasury, they're getting a wall of paper, but this only increases
[02:44:26.069 --> 02:44:29.172]  Well, I don't want credit for devastating moves.
[02:44:29.172 --> 02:44:30.713]  We'll just give it all to you, Max.
[02:44:54.045 --> 02:44:59.511]  Well, it launched on your show, and it caught fire, and they never anticipated that.
[02:44:59.511 --> 02:45:04.175]  In other words, they've got analysts who try to put pencil to paper and figure out the risk of owning all of the resources.
[02:45:04.175 --> 02:45:15.187]  No, they've got Google, predictive, futuristic modeling systems, but they can't gauge the organic, explosive, info-war, attack paradigm.
[02:45:15.691 --> 02:45:16.051]  That's right.
[02:45:16.051 --> 02:45:18.672]  That was not calculated on their risk analysis.
[02:45:18.672 --> 02:45:21.094]  And they've been playing catch-up ever since.
[02:45:21.094 --> 02:45:23.255]  And it just gets worse and worse every single day.
[02:45:23.255 --> 02:45:31.078]  And the Devon Note House spectacle, to me, is a clear indication that we've totally won this war.
[02:45:31.078 --> 02:45:38.822]  Because they're going after numb-nuts, nobody with a silver Liberty coin, to try to attack this guy to get immediately $7 million of silver to him.
[02:45:40.544 --> 02:45:49.536]  They're doing it to scare people that are holding silver and gold and to teach juries that silver and gold is illegal even when it's not.
[02:45:55.307 --> 02:46:01.250]  It's time to call their bluff and as a British naval lord once said, damn the torpedoes, go straight at them.
[02:46:15.299 --> 02:46:16.780]  They're in the tuxedos.
[02:46:16.780 --> 02:46:19.521]  Let's go straight to the cocktail bar.
[02:46:19.521 --> 02:46:20.722]  We got them!
[02:46:20.722 --> 02:46:30.567]  I mean, this is the best news we could have had, is this spectacle of these coming out and going after this guy after $7 million worth of silver.
[02:46:30.567 --> 02:46:31.928]  I mean, how fantastic is that?
[02:46:32.528 --> 02:46:33.248]  How piddling?
[02:46:33.248 --> 02:46:35.009]  How corrupt?
[02:46:35.009 --> 02:46:37.289]  It's like you pull back the curtain at The Wizard of Oz.
[02:46:37.289 --> 02:46:40.770]  There's just a little old crumpled Jamie Dimon in his bag full of paper money.
[02:46:40.770 --> 02:46:42.190]  He's nothing.
[02:46:42.190 --> 02:46:43.190]  No, I agree.
[02:46:43.190 --> 02:46:52.952]  I mean, these bankers are ugly little hunchback men in $5,000 suits scrabbling around just like Ken Lay, just like Bernie Madoff.
[02:46:52.952 --> 02:46:55.933]  They're sacks of criminal maggot-filled pus.
[02:46:55.933 --> 02:47:00.574]  And all we've got to do is be red-blooded and let them hear our war growl of information.
[02:47:01.254 --> 02:47:03.256]  We're coming for you, New World Order!
[02:47:03.256 --> 02:47:05.718]  We've got history and destiny on our side!
[02:47:05.718 --> 02:47:11.443]  You may have taught some people that you're invincible with your little conman bluff, but it doesn't work on a lot of us.
[02:47:11.443 --> 02:47:12.784]  And we're coming for you!
[02:47:12.784 --> 02:47:16.908]  Let me hear your war growl, Max!
[02:47:16.908 --> 02:47:17.789]  Let me hear it!
[02:47:17.789 --> 02:47:19.310]  Watch the Google bomb!
[02:47:19.310 --> 02:47:20.852]  Let me hear your war growl!
[02:47:20.852 --> 02:47:22.333]  Pull the trigger!
[02:47:22.333 --> 02:47:23.214]  Pull the trigger, Alex!
[02:47:23.214 --> 02:47:24.475]  Silver Liberation Army!
[02:47:24.475 --> 02:47:25.436]  Watch the Google bomb!
[02:47:26.303 --> 02:47:27.626]  Alright, well here's the problem.
[02:47:27.626 --> 02:47:29.730]  Their algorithm is starting to defeat us on that.
[02:47:29.730 --> 02:47:33.918]  Have you launched an article that has Silver Liberation Army in the headline?
[02:47:33.918 --> 02:47:35.862]  It's on my site right now, MaxKaiser.com
[02:47:36.866 --> 02:47:39.967]  Okay, so we'll see if we can do this at the end of the show.
[02:47:39.967 --> 02:47:41.268]  It's harder at the end.
[02:47:41.268 --> 02:47:43.328]  Silver Liberation Army.
[02:47:43.328 --> 02:47:44.669]  Hit them, hit them hard, folks.
[02:47:44.669 --> 02:47:46.510]  Silver Liberation Army.
[02:47:46.510 --> 02:47:47.330]  Hit them, hit them hard.
[02:47:47.330 --> 02:47:49.911]  Three words into Google over and over and over again.
[02:47:49.911 --> 02:47:51.612]  We normally always succeeded.
[02:47:51.612 --> 02:47:53.832]  They now have algorithms trying to block us.
[02:47:53.832 --> 02:47:55.573]  Silver Liberation Army.
[02:47:55.573 --> 02:47:58.834]  And we'll clone his article at InfoWars.com right now.
[02:47:58.834 --> 02:48:03.276]  Tell the guys or the gals and everybody else clone his article at your site.
[02:48:03.276 --> 02:48:04.636]  Silver Liberation Army.
[02:48:04.636 --> 02:48:05.757]  You do have an article about this.
[02:48:06.425 --> 02:48:08.086]  It's on my site, MaxKaiser.com.
[02:48:08.086 --> 02:48:10.666]  Well done, Lord Kaiser.
[02:48:10.666 --> 02:48:13.847]  It's fantastic, Alex, I gotta tell ya.
[02:48:13.847 --> 02:48:17.128]  This is gonna be a major win, and then we're just gonna go win, win, win.
[02:48:17.128 --> 02:48:19.389]  I predict, you know... I wanna hear that in a minute, but I wanna hear your war growl.
[02:48:19.389 --> 02:48:35.634]  AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
[02:48:36.212 --> 02:48:40.075]  We're spoiling for a fight and nothing on earth is going to stop them!
[02:48:55.268 --> 02:48:56.671]  Alright, Civil Liberation Army.
[02:48:56.671 --> 02:48:57.131]  Three words.
[02:48:57.131 --> 02:48:58.093]  Civil Liberation Army.
[02:48:58.093 --> 02:48:59.035]  Civil Liberation Army.
[02:48:59.035 --> 02:49:00.197]  Civil Liberation Army.
[02:49:00.197 --> 02:49:01.479]  Civil Liberation Army.
[02:49:01.479 --> 02:49:02.601]  Attack Delta.
[02:49:02.601 --> 02:49:05.786]  And then add a bunch of sub-articles and plump links.
[02:49:05.786 --> 02:49:07.109]  You were going to say something about Ron Paul.
[02:49:07.109 --> 02:49:07.529]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:49:08.823 --> 02:49:13.844]  Well, the thing is, I think he's going to be nominated for this 2012 election.
[02:49:13.844 --> 02:49:15.104]  I really do.
[02:49:15.104 --> 02:49:16.945]  He's got the momentum.
[02:49:16.945 --> 02:49:18.845]  He's got the right message.
[02:49:18.845 --> 02:49:20.246]  It's his time.
[02:49:20.246 --> 02:49:25.547]  And he's going after these guys, and I'm a big supporter.
[02:49:25.547 --> 02:49:26.887]  You know, the guy has got it.
[02:49:26.887 --> 02:49:27.787]  This is his year.
[02:49:27.787 --> 02:49:28.628]  I really believe in him.
[02:49:28.628 --> 02:49:31.008]  I think Obama's got nothing.
[02:49:31.008 --> 02:49:33.729]  He was, as you pointed out in the Obama deception,
[02:49:34.409 --> 02:49:36.290]  He's just an empty suit.
[02:49:36.290 --> 02:49:37.590]  He's got nothing.
[02:49:37.590 --> 02:49:39.651]  And the inflation is skyrocketing.
[02:49:39.651 --> 02:49:43.952]  People are buying, you know, 12 bucks for a bag of tomatoes.
[02:49:43.952 --> 02:49:45.793]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[02:49:45.793 --> 02:49:47.233]  And they know exactly what the problem is.
[02:49:47.233 --> 02:49:48.454]  These bankers and the Fed.
[02:49:48.454 --> 02:49:49.534]  And that's Ron Paul.
[02:49:49.534 --> 02:49:50.535]  That's where he's going after.
[02:49:50.535 --> 02:49:52.315]  He's going after the problem.
[02:49:52.315 --> 02:49:53.395]  So this is what's happening.
[02:49:53.395 --> 02:49:56.937]  And I think he's going to do really, really well.
[02:49:56.937 --> 02:49:57.897]  Absolutely.
[02:49:57.897 --> 02:50:02.579]  And, you know, the system is horrified of Ron Paul, but they can't kill an idea.
[02:50:02.579 --> 02:50:03.599]  Ideas are bulletproof.
[02:50:04.298 --> 02:50:17.926]  Well, supposedly, tomorrow, he's doing an address in front of Congress, I think he talked about it, and he's going to start talking more and more about precious metals, the gold and silver, as their role in a sound economy and in rebuilding the American economy.
[02:50:17.926 --> 02:50:32.314]  And this, of course, if they come back and they have to go back to a gold standard, because the debts are so high, because they've got hundreds of trillions of dollars in debt, the way to go back to a Bretton Woods-style gold-backed currency, you'd have to mark the price of gold up to a minimum of $7,000 an ounce.
[02:50:33.815 --> 02:50:34.255]  A minimum of $7,000.
[02:50:34.255 --> 02:50:35.495]  All right, stay there.
[02:50:35.495 --> 02:50:37.096]  Let's talk about... Yeah, no.
[02:50:37.096 --> 02:50:38.916]  Ron Paul took the gloves off yesterday.
[02:50:38.916 --> 02:50:40.436]  Hardcore against the New World Order.
[02:50:40.436 --> 02:50:41.176]  Global government.
[02:50:41.176 --> 02:50:42.317]  They've engineered it.
[02:50:42.317 --> 02:50:43.717]  Hardcore yesterday.
[02:50:43.717 --> 02:50:44.857]  He's taking the gloves off.
[02:50:44.857 --> 02:50:45.917]  We all gotta do it.
[02:50:45.917 --> 02:50:52.159]  It's now time to get serious and put your war face on, ladies and gentlemen, and gut up, okay?
[02:50:52.159 --> 02:50:54.279]  Because the globalists aren't gonna give us quarter.
[02:50:54.279 --> 02:50:55.959]  We gotta go in against them right now.
[02:50:55.959 --> 02:50:57.059]  It's InfoWar.
[02:50:57.059 --> 02:50:58.800]  We'll be right back with Max Keiser.
[02:50:58.800 --> 02:50:59.700]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:51:01.033 --> 02:51:10.559]  Nine years, thousands of clients worldwide, amazing results, and here's more proof of the effectiveness of how Heart and Body Extract supports good circulation and healthy arterial flow.
[02:51:10.559 --> 02:51:11.880]  My name is Crystal.
[02:51:11.880 --> 02:51:14.801]  I'm a 45-year-old and live in Houston, Texas.
[02:51:14.801 --> 02:51:18.764]  I was diagnosed with having mitral valve prolapse 10 years ago.
[02:51:18.764 --> 02:51:22.906]  My cardiologist said surgery and drugs was the only thing he could offer me.
[02:51:22.906 --> 02:51:23.747]  What did Crystal do?
[02:51:23.747 --> 02:51:26.168]  I ordered Heart and Body Extract in August 2006.
[02:51:27.689 --> 02:51:34.091]  When I first took my first 15 drops, I embraced the formula and could even feel the goodness of the formula starting to work.
[02:51:34.091 --> 02:51:37.933]  Clean, clear arteries are happy arteries after using Heart and Body Extract.

[02:51:40.434 --> 02:51:41.254]  That's HBextract.com or call 866-295-5305.
[02:51:41.254 --> 02:51:43.355]  HBextract comes with a 100% ironclad money back guarantee.
[02:51:43.355 --> 02:51:45.556]  Details at HBextract.com or
[02:51:56.620 --> 02:52:00.483]  Or call 866-295-5305 for heart and body extract.
[02:52:00.483 --> 02:52:02.285]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:52:02.285 --> 02:52:17.858]  The earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear disaster that killed thousands of Japanese citizens is nothing compared to the devastation that could be caused by hyperinflation that will soon hit the United States and could lead to millions of Americans becoming homeless, all caused by the devalued U.S.
[02:52:17.858 --> 02:52:18.198]  dollar.
[02:52:18.198 --> 02:52:23.623]  While the mainstream media continues to ignore inflation, our friends at the National Inflation Association provide.
[02:52:23.863 --> 02:52:27.886]  A free weekly newsletter that educates Americans of the facts and truth about the U.S.
[02:52:27.886 --> 02:52:29.087]  economy and inflation.
[02:52:29.087 --> 02:52:39.174]  I urge you to sign up at the NIA's free newsletter at www.inflation.us to learn how you can not only survive but prosper during the upcoming hyperinflation crisis.
[02:52:39.174 --> 02:52:45.238]  Silver has more than doubled since the NIA declared silver the best investment for the next decade on inflation.us.
[02:52:45.578 --> 02:52:55.052]  The NIA's team of expert economists are happy to answer any economic questions you have about inflation, debt, currencies, real estate, precious metals, and commodities.
[02:52:55.052 --> 02:53:00.019]  Visit inflation.us to learn the economic truth that the mainstream media ignores.
[02:53:00.498 --> 02:53:03.919]  The largest part of gaining radiant health is detoxification.
[02:53:03.919 --> 02:53:11.762]  You can drink ionized water, cleanse your intestines, eat a perfect diet, and even take lots of quality supplements and in many instances only make minimal progress.
[02:53:11.762 --> 02:53:16.303]  What is the key to detoxifying your body of mercury, heavy metals, chemicals, and drugs?
[02:53:16.303 --> 02:53:17.744]  It is glutathione.
[02:53:17.744 --> 02:53:21.805]  Glutathione is the master antioxidant used to detoxify your entire body.
[02:53:21.805 --> 02:53:25.186]  It stops free radicals, keeps cells young, and reduces inflammation.
[02:53:25.806 --> 02:53:31.589]  One World Whey Protein Powder may be able to raise your glutathione production by 64% or more.
[02:53:31.589 --> 02:53:38.833]  One World Whey is more effective than any other whey protein powder on the market because it is unheated and from grass-fed cows.
[02:53:38.833 --> 02:53:45.276]  All other, quote, cold-processed whey protein powders have been heated and damaged by 15% or more.
[02:53:45.276 --> 02:53:47.317]  One World Whey comes in three delicious flavors.
[02:53:47.677 --> 02:53:48.097]  Call 888-988-3325.
[02:53:48.097 --> 02:53:48.297]  That's 888-988-3325.
[02:53:48.297 --> 02:53:49.358]  Or visit OneWorldWay.com.
[02:53:49.358 --> 02:53:49.878]  That's OneWorldWhey.com.
[02:54:11.013 --> 02:54:16.340]  Okay, Max has got actually a little blurb video up about the Silver Liberation Army.
[02:54:16.340 --> 02:54:17.921]  He's gonna get a little article out soon.
[02:54:17.921 --> 02:54:28.734]  We'll get it up at InfoWars and Prison Planet, so that when you search Silver Liberation Army, when people see it listed on Google News and all the media checks that daily for trends, then they'll know what we're talking about.
[02:54:29.808 --> 02:54:30.929]  But very, very exciting.
[02:54:30.929 --> 02:54:39.712]  Getting back to Ron Paul, he has clearly taken the gloves off and is going to be exposing what's going on at the Mint, how they're not allowing enough for supply.
[02:54:39.712 --> 02:54:46.294]  We see the paper price of silver and gold being way below what it really is in the market.
[02:54:46.294 --> 02:54:50.675]  I mean, slowly but surely, the globalist time is running out.
[02:54:50.675 --> 02:54:54.597]  More comments on Ron Paul and when you really think they're going to default on the comics.
[02:54:56.075 --> 02:55:12.502]  Well, yeah, as you point out, you know, the game for the silver market for years, because silver doesn't pay any interest, this is how the whole thing got started, they would short silver and buy back cheaper, and then the federal government would allow them to do so by leasing them out precious metals.
[02:55:12.502 --> 02:55:20.545]  And this is the way the investment banks and the broker-dealers could make up maybe 1 or 2% a year on silver and gold, which don't pay any interest.
[02:55:20.925 --> 02:55:26.548]  But what's happened over the past 10 or 15 years is that the amount that they've sold short has mushroomed and ballooned.
[02:55:26.548 --> 02:55:41.154]  And with interest rates at 0%, their ability to borrow money from the Fed and other sources at 0% means that they can expand that silver short position to where it is astronomically large, and this is where the unexpected thing happens, the black swan event.
[02:55:41.514 --> 02:55:42.215]  We're good to go.
[02:55:58.525 --> 02:55:59.486]  We're good to go.
[02:56:28.665 --> 02:56:29.685]  We're good to go.
[02:56:56.412 --> 02:57:01.675]  You know, from 20 years ago, there was that huge swing in the marketplace.
[02:57:01.675 --> 02:57:03.476]  JPMorgan are the losers.
[02:57:03.476 --> 02:57:09.300]  They have to go into the market and buy in the open market, which is only going to catapult the price into the triple figures.
[02:57:09.300 --> 02:57:13.002]  It's almost comical, because it's going to be such a spectacular firework.
[02:57:13.002 --> 02:57:15.603]  Because it's been cheap for 20 years, artificially cheap.
[02:57:15.603 --> 02:57:16.924]  So the genie's out of the bottle.
[02:57:16.924 --> 02:57:21.627]  Meanwhile, if you own it, you're getting wealthier, and the banks are getting poorer.
[02:57:21.627 --> 02:57:22.707]  That's the beautiful thing.
[02:57:22.707 --> 02:57:25.209]  They stole our wealth, now we're taking it back.
[02:57:29.251 --> 02:57:45.502]  Well, you're absolutely right, and I am seeing the trolls and the George Soros people go all out against Ron Paul right now with their Pentagon robot fake posts, so people better get ready and pray for Ron Paul and pray for everybody else that's in this fight.
[02:57:45.502 --> 02:57:51.425]  Pray for me, please, Max Keiser, everybody else, because this is a very serious time to be alive, and
[02:57:53.163 --> 02:57:56.510]  We've got some gallows humor here, but this is not a joke at the end of the day.
[02:57:56.510 --> 02:57:59.536]  This is very, very serious time we're in.
[02:57:59.536 --> 02:58:04.405]  Max, what's your ETA on having that Silver Liberation Army article out?
[02:58:04.405 --> 02:58:05.047]  Like 10 minutes.
[02:58:05.981 --> 02:58:06.682]  Well, take your time.
[02:58:06.682 --> 02:58:10.385]  It'll take a few hours for this to go to number one, and it's up to the listeners out there.
[02:58:10.385 --> 02:58:10.905]  Three words.
[02:58:10.905 --> 02:58:12.167]  Put it in Google over and over again.
[02:58:12.167 --> 02:58:13.408]  Hit enter over and over again.
[02:58:13.408 --> 02:58:15.129]  I'll do it after the show here in a minute.
[02:58:15.129 --> 02:58:16.330]  Silver Liberation Army.
[02:58:16.330 --> 02:58:18.112]  We'll see you back live tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[02:58:18.112 --> 02:58:18.732]  Central.
[02:58:18.732 --> 02:58:21.655]  More informative, big guests tomorrow, right through Friday.
[02:58:21.655 --> 02:58:22.736]  You thought Ventura was big.
[02:58:22.736 --> 02:58:23.877]  Ron Paul, Max Keiser.
[02:58:23.877 --> 02:58:25.318]  We got even more for you.
[02:58:25.318 --> 02:58:28.721]  Bringing you the number one most informative guests and analysis and information.
[02:58:28.721 --> 02:58:31.264]  Max Keiser, thank you so much for spending time with us.
[02:58:32.861 --> 02:58:33.563]  Yes, yes Alex.
[02:58:33.563 --> 02:58:34.746]  Thank you.
[02:58:34.746 --> 02:58:38.437]  Alright, retransmission starts now with Lindsey Williams at InfoWars.com.
[02:58:38.437 --> 02:58:39.119]  God bless you all.
