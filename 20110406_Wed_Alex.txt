[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:20.760]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.760 --> 00:34.680]  well Reuters is reporting that OPEC is saying if the Middle East unrest continues oil may
[00:34.680 --> 00:43.160]  go to 200 to $300 a barrel in the next few months as the unrest in Bahrain Saudi Arabia
[00:43.160 --> 00:51.160]  but Jordan Syria obviously the war going on in Libya it is all just intensifying and
[00:51.160 --> 00:56.800]  they've got a bunch of analysts in this Reuters report that came out yesterday that guys repull
[00:56.800 --> 01:03.480]  me that headline from yesterday please oil to go to $200 to $300 a barrel on Saudi unrest
[01:03.480 --> 01:10.520]  so Lindsay Williams called it six months ago in October of 2010 from Ken Fromm who then
[01:10.520 --> 01:16.080]  died two months later of cancer former head of operations Atlantic Ridgefield with his
[01:16.080 --> 01:22.440]  inside knowledge and the other still living CEO former CEO even more high powered of another
[01:22.440 --> 01:27.520]  major oil company name known to me but I'm not allowed to give it out obviously that
[01:27.520 --> 01:32.080]  this that they would start unrest in the Middle East and then trigger this global meltdown
[01:32.080 --> 01:36.960]  through that system we're going to be talking about that with Lindsay Williams coming up
[01:36.960 --> 01:46.320]  in one hour today that said obviously it is Wednesday the sixth day of April 2011 and
[01:46.320 --> 01:49.840]  we're going to be live here for the next three hours I'm going to open the phones up coming
[01:49.840 --> 01:56.320]  up later in this hour and we're going to go over all of the important news as well rebel
[01:56.320 --> 02:01.800]  held Libya running out of cash the rebels say NATO is the problem Europe feels the strain
[02:01.800 --> 02:08.840]  is us alters Libya policy oil near two and a half year peak on Middle East week dollar
[02:08.840 --> 02:13.520]  defense secretary meeting with Saudi king to discuss mitties unrest tired of violence
[02:13.520 --> 02:20.920]  Mexicans ready for mass protest Obama rolling out his new Facebook campaign commodities gold
[02:20.920 --> 02:30.440]  hits new record Brent oil above $122 a barrel right now obviously it made big news in us
[02:30.440 --> 02:37.320]  say today Politico the hill New York Times when Ron Paul said that he will announce one
[02:37.320 --> 02:42.040]  where the other in a month or less if he's going to be running for president and basically
[02:42.040 --> 02:46.160]  hinted that he would be running for president his son Rand Paul is in the news today saying
[02:46.160 --> 02:53.260]  he expects him to run we're going to be breaking all of that down but we've got a scyop going
[02:53.260 --> 03:01.800]  on here where we're so distracted with the economy we're so distracted with what's happening
[03:01.800 --> 03:12.480]  as well with the new wars and NCA and other distractions that we're missing the forest
[03:12.480 --> 03:21.560]  for the trees here scores of mainstream publications are quietly reporting that the United States
[03:21.560 --> 03:30.000]  Canada and even the EU are set to raise what they say is safe radiation levels and of course
[03:30.000 --> 03:37.240]  we've already had Dr. Busby on the broadcast who's a chemical physicist breaking down
[03:37.240 --> 03:43.240]  that what they already say is safe levels is the key to the entire whitewash with all
[03:43.240 --> 03:47.560]  the different forms of radiation that are being loosed upon the planet through reactors
[03:47.560 --> 03:54.040]  du nuclear weapons production facilities enrichment facilities but now that's becoming more evident
[03:54.040 --> 03:59.120]  than ever with them just saying we'll just raise the level and not report to people what's
[03:59.120 --> 04:07.560]  in the produce what's in the milk India has banned any Japanese fish seafood produce fruits
[04:07.560 --> 04:13.640]  vegetables beef coming into India other countries are moving to do that though they're on the
[04:13.640 --> 04:19.920]  other side of the world compared to where the winds the wind start over Japan go over
[04:19.920 --> 04:26.920]  the Pacific hit North America Atlantic Europe Middle East Central Asia and so India is literally
[04:26.920 --> 04:31.200]  on the other side of the world comparatively other geographically closer to Japan they're
[04:31.200 --> 04:35.360]  on the other side of the world where this radiation is coming in but they're banning
[04:35.360 --> 04:39.680]  the importation but here there's no discussion about that they're saying well if it does get
[04:39.680 --> 04:44.080]  higher in the food which it's showing we'll just say it's safe man wave the magic pixie
[04:44.080 --> 04:48.920]  wand so we're going to be covering that first when we get back then into all the economic
[04:48.920 --> 04:53.960]  military news Lindsay Williams coming up info wars dot com prison planet dot com GCN live

[05:10.760 --> 05:15.840]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I have tremendous influence
[05:15.840 --> 05:21.120]  on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I think it's incumbent
[05:21.120 --> 05:27.040]  upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for the republic identifies the
[05:27.040 --> 05:32.680]  enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty
[05:32.680 --> 05:37.600]  and on its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists they're
[05:37.600 --> 05:41.720]  asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today
[05:41.720 --> 05:48.920]  seems like nobody does care right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the republic yet

[08:20.600 --> 08:40.920]  Jones welcome my friends welcome it is Wednesday the sixth day of April 2011 Pastor Lindsey
[08:40.920 --> 08:48.080]  Williams with his very important connections into former oil company CEOs and executives
[08:48.080 --> 08:56.880]  dropped the key bombshell on us in October what 22nd 2010 now six months ago that the
[08:56.880 --> 09:02.200]  globalist would trigger destabilization in the Middle East leading directly to massive
[09:02.200 --> 09:10.920]  oil price increases within six months to a year of $150 to $200 a barrel Brent crude
[09:10.920 --> 09:20.720]  is now trading at $122 a barrel that is the news headlines today here is Reuters yesterday
[09:20.720 --> 09:30.440]  update oil could hit $200 to $300 a barrel on Saudi unrest and unrest in Yemen as well
[09:30.440 --> 09:36.280]  as Bahrain and other areas that's what many top analysts are now saying there's an emergency
[09:36.280 --> 09:43.200]  meeting set to happen in the next two days with the Saudi king and secretary of defense
[09:43.200 --> 09:49.720]  gates also new article that just went up minutes ago at info wars dot com we're going to be
[09:49.720 --> 09:56.600]  breaking down Ron Paul gold commodity prices big event signaling economic collapse has
[09:56.600 --> 10:04.760]  begun signaling big event economic collapse and so that report and the video and audio
[10:04.760 --> 10:10.440]  interview with Ron Paul is up on info wars dot com and present planet dot com that interview
[10:10.440 --> 10:16.040]  made headlines today and yesterday and more than 10 major newspapers including us a today
[10:16.040 --> 10:23.080]  the hill politico and the new york times headline from info wars dot com Ron Paul to announce
[10:23.080 --> 10:27.480]  presidential bid next month appearing on the Alex Jones show today Texas representative
[10:27.480 --> 10:32.080]  Ron Paul said he will make a final decision within a month on whether he will run for
[10:32.080 --> 10:36.760]  president in 2012 the congressman added that he will soon make a token decision if he will
[10:36.760 --> 10:41.040]  participate in a presidential debate to be held in South Carolina and the way he said
[10:41.040 --> 10:45.840]  it is he's going to take part in that in May Dr. Paul said he will likely agree to be included
[10:45.840 --> 10:51.160]  in the debate which is again saying a token that he's in the race between potential presidential
[10:51.160 --> 10:57.480]  contenders without a commitment to run or officially filing papers declaring his candidacy
[10:57.480 --> 11:02.280]  that will be covered a little bit later in the hour and more detail here is the hill
[11:02.280 --> 11:09.800]  reporting on our report Ron Paul to make presidential decision in next month here is politico in
[11:09.800 --> 11:16.280]  us say today Ron Paul close to joining 2012 presidential race decision day Ron Paul says
[11:16.280 --> 11:23.120]  it's next month so that is just some of those reports that we're going to be breaking down
[11:23.120 --> 11:31.200]  for you today we've also got the latest news on what's happening in North Africa in Libya
[11:31.200 --> 11:36.880]  the latest on GOP budget proposal not a penny for Obamacare certainly good news with the
[11:36.880 --> 11:42.280]  republicans so far keeping our promise because of massive public backlash on that front they
[11:42.280 --> 11:47.560]  smell victory the question is will they reverse themselves once they get back into full power
[11:47.560 --> 11:51.960]  over the House Senate and perhaps the next two years or year and a half the presidency
[11:51.960 --> 11:57.080]  of the United States the globalist of course do still control both parties but the republicans
[11:57.080 --> 12:04.320]  are playing the part right now as the populist rebels also there's a AP article promoting
[12:04.320 --> 12:08.880]  climate manipulation in geoengineering as a way to save us from global warming as they
[12:08.880 --> 12:13.560]  admit more and more that they are chemtrailing us but they say all of the previous chemtrailing
[12:13.560 --> 12:19.120]  has simply been scientific testing that they may increase the operations so they're now
[12:19.120 --> 12:24.480]  introducing that to the public commodities gold is hit record new high and again Brent
[12:24.480 --> 12:30.560]  crude above $122 per barrel that out of Reuters today we're going to be going over all of
[12:30.560 --> 12:36.520]  that in great detail and Lindsay Williams as I said is joining us coming up in about 50
[12:36.520 --> 12:41.560]  minutes from now for the full second hour will also open the phones up for folks who
[12:41.560 --> 12:47.840]  have any questions or comments for Pastor Lindsay Williams that said before I came into
[12:47.840 --> 12:52.640]  the office this morning my wife had been reading info wars dot com and prison planet dot com
[12:52.640 --> 12:57.000]  the last few days and she said I've been listening to your show and I've heard you talk some
[12:57.000 --> 13:03.160]  about this but isn't this the big top story my wife rarely gets involved in the show years
[13:03.160 --> 13:07.640]  ago she was my producer and webmaster for info wars dot com going back more than 10
[13:07.640 --> 13:13.440]  years ago she's always been involved but normally she just doesn't have a lot of input on listening
[13:13.440 --> 13:17.840]  to the show on which direction I should go and I really thought about it I said you know
[13:17.840 --> 13:22.440]  you're right I've talked about it quite a bit but not as much as we should I talked
[13:22.440 --> 13:29.240]  about it for an hour Sunday an hour on Monday probably 30 minutes yesterday but but really
[13:29.240 --> 13:34.480]  she's right that even though the mainstream media is spending this and acting like it's
[13:34.480 --> 13:42.040]  no big deal it's a huge deal we have the New York Times reporting with California papers
[13:42.040 --> 13:51.280]  reporting as of Sunday 181 times safe levels of radioactive iodine 131 found via the state
[13:51.280 --> 13:57.440]  monitoring facility at Berkeley in the tap water minor footnote the news I now have articles
[13:57.440 --> 14:04.800]  out of the EU articles out of Canada articles out of the US we're quietly the EPA of our
[14:04.800 --> 14:12.560]  government but also other governments environmental monitors agencies are announcing that they
[14:12.560 --> 14:18.680]  are set to raise the safe levels of radioactive isotopes I guess they wave the magic wand
[14:18.680 --> 14:24.160]  and tell us what's safe and many of the radiologists nuclear physicists chemical physicists we've
[14:24.160 --> 14:28.840]  had on have pointed out that they already have radiation set at a level that they say
[14:28.840 --> 14:34.320]  is safe that's not safe just like they say DU is now safe for the troops though 20 years
[14:34.320 --> 14:38.000]  ago before that they said it was so deadly they couldn't use it unless they were in
[14:38.000 --> 14:42.240]  a full out nuclear war already as an emergency weapon for ground troops to be able to take
[14:42.240 --> 14:48.840]  on the 10 to 1 superiority of Russian armor pouring in to the what folder gap in Germany
[14:48.840 --> 14:53.760]  and other areas it was an emergency weapon to be served out of the armories only once
[14:53.760 --> 14:58.440]  nuclear war already started but in 91 they made the decision to wave the magic wand and
[14:58.440 --> 15:03.040]  say that it was no longer a problem the troops could use it use it at shooting ranges proving
[15:03.040 --> 15:11.160]  grounds in wars bomb civilian centers Israel use it against Lebanon Gaza is with even though
[15:11.160 --> 15:17.480]  it blows right back into Israel the winds blow from the north and from the West East
[15:17.480 --> 15:23.560]  it blows right back on Israel they made the decision to use it in Libya Iraq Afghanistan
[15:23.560 --> 15:28.560]  Pakistan they they they use it in proving grounds again testing facilities all over
[15:28.560 --> 15:34.960]  the continental US Hawaii Puerto Rico it's just incredible and so what they're doing
[15:34.960 --> 15:45.080]  is in plain view they're now reporting radiation dumping into the ocean Reuters AP LA Times
[15:45.080 --> 15:53.280]  Kyoto news we covered this yesterday all with the headlines radiation 7.5 million and that's
[15:53.280 --> 15:59.120]  confirmed safe levels being dumped directly out of the reactors into the Pacific Ocean
[15:59.120 --> 16:03.320]  with those currents going right towards the US though it'll take they say six weeks on
[16:03.320 --> 16:09.960]  average to get here I mean this is just incredible 7.5 million times now the Japanese are saying
[16:09.960 --> 16:15.560]  there's so much radiation coming out that it's incalculable so many different variants
[16:15.560 --> 16:25.000]  so many different types uranium plutonium cesium iodine tritium I mean it's dozens
[16:25.000 --> 16:33.040]  of them it's just a giant laundry list 7.5 million the reactor still smoking still putting
[16:33.040 --> 16:39.480]  off smoke that gets into the trade winds into the jet stream blowing over here it's just
[16:39.480 --> 16:45.840]  incredible but the bigger issue is that the media here is reporting on this in minor
[16:45.840 --> 16:51.200]  footnotes if you go to info wars.com and prison planet.com we have boil down articles with
[16:51.200 --> 16:56.880]  little snippets from mainstream news and then links to the news we're buried in each article
[16:56.880 --> 17:07.000]  they take just incredible news and just bury it like it's no big deal and in KH world reporting
[17:07.000 --> 17:13.840]  plant radiation monitor says levels immeasurable an info wars report that has links to the
[17:13.840 --> 17:23.480]  EPA own statements America and EU agree raise radiation levels for food and back with Chernobyl
[17:23.480 --> 17:28.800]  in 86 the different European countries for over six months you can go pull these old
[17:28.800 --> 17:38.680]  reports up only shipped in frozen food vegetables fruit poultry beef fish from the Americas and
[17:38.680 --> 17:45.800]  from Asia the grain the milk all of it was just thrown away production shut down for
[17:45.800 --> 17:50.960]  at least six months until the levels went down in the food especially for children and
[17:50.960 --> 17:55.240]  we've had nuclear physicist on saying you know this hundred and eighty one times level
[17:55.240 --> 18:00.040]  being safe buzz be doctor buzz be said let's get buzz be back on tomorrow we can or even
[18:00.040 --> 18:03.760]  today if you could do it in the last thirty minutes I know Williams is coming up that
[18:03.760 --> 18:08.000]  he would look at still talking to a physician yourself but the children might want to start
[18:08.000 --> 18:15.560]  taking potassium iodate on the west coast I'm not saying that I'm a medical doctor
[18:15.560 --> 18:20.520]  or a chemical physicist you know who reports to the EU and even the BBC I mean he's an
[18:20.520 --> 18:26.120]  expert but you can take what he said and research yourself I I can't make that call for you
[18:26.120 --> 18:32.320]  that's a call for you to make but it's out of sight out of mind they're just burying
[18:32.320 --> 18:38.960]  this information that oh it's no big deal the EPA and the EU are set to raise the levels
[18:38.960 --> 18:44.760]  of what they say is safe in beef in poultry in milk obviously cows are large they eat
[18:44.760 --> 18:54.400]  a lot of grass with the accumulated fallout coming in and it bio accumulates there and
[18:54.400 --> 19:01.480]  then the cows excrete it we breathe it as well but but they also excrete it in the
[19:01.480 --> 19:06.680]  higher levels if the waters got a hundred and eighty one times and in in the bay area
[19:06.680 --> 19:12.040]  safe levels of radioactive iodine can you imagine when the cows bio accumulate that
[19:12.040 --> 19:16.240]  and what's going on in the milk and the EPA's answer is they're not giving out radiation
[19:16.240 --> 19:24.500]  numbers Washington and Oregon and California have and so there's just a complete white
[19:24.500 --> 19:30.160]  wash and ongoing cover up of this happening and and and even I'm susceptible to this that

[24:07.040 --> 24:25.000]  well it's so predictable that we're three plus weeks into this crisis what three weeks
[24:25.000 --> 24:33.720]  and five days and the european union the u.s. government the canadian government they're
[24:33.720 --> 24:38.200]  all discussing they don't want to scare the public and actually have people take precautions
[24:38.200 --> 24:42.880]  to protect themselves and they're saying well we're just set to raise the safe levels the
[24:42.880 --> 24:48.600]  e p a last week said last wednesday yes we found higher levels of radioactive isotopes
[24:48.600 --> 24:56.160]  and cow milk on the on the west coast in three states but we expect these levels to drop
[24:56.160 --> 25:00.920]  well they're obviously not dropping because the lion share of that radiation of the last
[25:00.920 --> 25:07.680]  two weeks is now just arriving and settling in on top of the other radioactive fallout
[25:07.680 --> 25:13.360]  that's been building up day after day of quote low level radiation stacking on top of each
[25:13.360 --> 25:18.640]  other you stack enough pieces of paper on top of each other you know you get a big pile
[25:18.640 --> 25:22.920]  well it's the same thing with radiation it starts to go up and up and up and their response
[25:22.920 --> 25:30.880]  is hey now it's seven point five million times normal levels of radiation dumping into the
[25:30.880 --> 25:34.640]  ocean so what it's not a problem and the japanese say they don't think it'll be a problem for
[25:34.640 --> 25:40.160]  seafood and the only country big country i've seen is india saying we're banning everything
[25:40.160 --> 25:45.160]  from japan that's produce coming into this nation and they're on the other side of the
[25:45.160 --> 25:48.600]  world from the fallout it's got to go all the way around the world before it gets back
[25:48.600 --> 25:53.160]  to their brandon tuberville wrote a good article boiling us down with links to the mainstream
[25:53.160 --> 26:00.400]  news and e p a america and e u raise radiation levels for food this is on info wars dot com
[26:00.400 --> 26:04.440]  on march twenty eight two thousand eleven i wrote an article entitled e p a to help mainstream
[26:04.440 --> 26:11.000]  media obscure the truth about radiation exposure to americans in which i discussed the changes
[26:11.000 --> 26:16.000]  to the p a g's protective action guidelines being proposed by the e p a environmental protection
[26:16.000 --> 26:21.680]  agency that would raise the acceptable levels of radiation allowed in the environment food
[26:21.680 --> 26:27.480]  and even the general public themselves in the event of a nuclear emergency interestingly
[26:27.480 --> 26:32.640]  enough another article was published on april third two thousand eleven by alexander higgins
[26:32.640 --> 26:39.880]  citing k o p p online and xander news stating that similar rule change was occurring in
[26:39.880 --> 26:47.320]  the european union p a g's or policies and guidelines established by the e p a that guide
[26:47.320 --> 26:53.640]  the e p a's response to the event of radioactive emergency specifically p a g's deal with
[26:53.640 --> 26:59.360]  how the e p a should enforce laws such as the clean air act the water act in relation
[26:59.360 --> 27:04.560]  to disaster although p a g's had already been established in ninety two the agency now plans
[27:04.560 --> 27:09.680]  to amend these guidelines to much higher levels of acceptable radiation and he has links to
[27:09.680 --> 27:14.240]  the e p a's announcements and i was on man cal as i am every wednesday his big syndicated
[27:14.240 --> 27:20.280]  show and he was playing news clips but we might try to dig them up but but but he had
[27:20.280 --> 27:25.280]  actually national news clips saying yes well the e p a's to raise acceptable radiation
[27:25.280 --> 27:29.480]  levels i mean what they say is safe so i guess when i say the mainstream media isn't covering
[27:29.480 --> 27:34.560]  this that's not entirely accurate they're covering it but it's just a footnote it's
[27:34.560 --> 27:42.080]  just yeah we're set to raise the safe level threshold to a higher level and it continues
[27:42.080 --> 27:49.440]  no congressional approval is needed is a legally needed to make such changes because
[27:49.440 --> 27:54.040]  the e p a is a regulatory agency that sets policy like they're shutting down coal power
[27:54.040 --> 27:58.320]  plants with no laws behind them although these types of agencies can be directed by congress
[27:58.320 --> 28:02.240]  or the president they often form their own policies all that is required as an agency
[28:02.240 --> 28:07.480]  such as the e p a wish to change their policy is that they first publish the proposed changes
[28:07.480 --> 28:13.200]  to the federal register for a designated public period or public comment time however since
[28:13.200 --> 28:17.120]  public opinion is worth virtually nothing once the proposed changes published in the
[28:17.120 --> 28:22.120]  federal register is well in its way to becoming the new policy this is the unfortunate to
[28:22.120 --> 28:28.200]  consider the fact that according to p e e r public employees for environmental responsibility
[28:28.200 --> 28:33.440]  the new standards were result in a nearly one thousand here's the key nearly one thousand
[28:33.440 --> 28:38.520]  fold increase for exposure to strontium ninety and three thousand to one hundred thousand
[28:38.520 --> 28:43.560]  fold increase hike for exposure to iodine one three one so they're worried about it
[28:43.560 --> 28:48.400]  being so high that the proposed rules that we have links to they've entered this in the
[28:48.400 --> 28:53.320]  register would be three thousand to one hundred thousand time hike for iodine one three one
[28:53.320 --> 28:58.240]  that's what they're really picking up and almost twenty five thousand rise for exposure
[28:58.240 --> 29:04.760]  to radioactive nickel sixty three in drinking water which brings us to the e u mirror of
[29:04.760 --> 29:09.720]  e p a policy actually set back in eighty nine by amending standards in eighty seven and
[29:09.720 --> 29:16.560]  they are now announcing the e u ordinance two nine seven slash two zero one one raises
[29:16.560 --> 29:24.360]  the maximum levels of radiation and radioactive isotopes for the food and feed to rather serious
[29:24.360 --> 29:30.920]  levels including animal feed in some cases such as a cesium one three four and cesium
[29:30.920 --> 29:37.480]  one three seven the levels are actually twice the amount of previously acceptable levels
[29:37.480 --> 29:42.320]  many of these increases are allowed in products such as infant formula and baby foods and it

[34:11.200 --> 34:18.480]  this show having that type of effect on people and just it's interesting to see how many
[34:18.480 --> 34:24.120]  prominent people are really waking up to the new world order i want to go through a little
[34:24.120 --> 34:30.320]  bit more on these radiation headlines and the fact that in plain view the federal government
[34:30.320 --> 34:36.880]  is not giving us radiation numbers state governments have quietly put out numbers of as high as
[34:36.880 --> 34:44.680]  181 times safe levels of radioactive iodine and it's not getting any of the attention
[34:44.680 --> 34:50.120]  it needs how do we get the word out on this i mean sure i do other radio interviews i
[34:50.120 --> 34:56.280]  go on other tv programs i try to bring these issues up a lot of people don't want to know
[34:56.280 --> 35:02.240]  how serious this is they just want to imagine that everything's going to be okay before
[35:02.240 --> 35:07.480]  we go back to the calls it is your support of the sponsors of the show our local am
[35:07.480 --> 35:12.760]  and fm affiliate sponsors as well that makes this broadcast possible and funds the news

[35:42.440 --> 35:48.840]  these people as they implode the world economy and try to offer their solution of total world
[35:48.840 --> 35:56.360]  tyranny as as the way out as ron paul concurred yesterday so 63 documents the government doesn't

[37:53.840 --> 37:58.880]  get an info wars dot com shirt get a in the fed shirt with info wars dot com on it get
[37:58.880 --> 38:04.360]  a draft ron paul 2012 by the way he will be announcing you heard it here first i'm not
[38:04.360 --> 38:08.320]  going to get any more details but he will be announcing the next month the the run for
[38:08.320 --> 38:12.960]  the presidency barring medical checkups and things and he's last time he was in good health
[38:12.960 --> 38:17.600]  but he's getting that all checked out barring a few things with the family and some other
[38:17.600 --> 38:22.480]  issues ron paul will be announcing he's running for president the next month i mean you heard
[38:22.480 --> 38:26.560]  him pretty much say that yesterday here on air but i yeah so that limited edition shirt
[38:26.560 --> 38:31.520]  will will not be available as soon as he announces in fact i'm already going to give the word
[38:31.520 --> 38:35.640]  today not to reorder anymore though so when they sell out that's it for the draft ron
[38:35.640 --> 38:40.600]  paul 2012 shirts that are quite handsome and again when you're on the street you will you
[38:40.600 --> 38:45.040]  will find out how many people are awake and involved and know what's happening very exciting
[38:45.040 --> 38:49.880]  tools all available at info wars dot com or call eight eight eight two five three three
[38:49.880 --> 38:57.280]  one three nine so uh... the u.s. government is set to increase safe radiation levels
[38:57.280 --> 39:05.520]  with uh... strontium by ninety times uh... three thousand one hundred thousand fold for iodine one three one
[39:05.520 --> 39:10.520]  twenty five thousand are right at right below twenty five thousand uh... time increase for
[39:10.520 --> 39:14.480]  exposure to radioactive nickel sixty three and that of course is the stuff showing up
[39:14.480 --> 39:20.040]  in the milk uh... and food show what they just again just magically say it's safe so
[39:20.040 --> 39:25.040]  it's safe and they're not warning people and i'm sorry for dairy producers on the west
[39:25.040 --> 39:30.400]  coast uh... of course radiation showing up all over the u.s. uh... but i'm sorry for
[39:30.400 --> 39:33.680]  folks over there but that's where most of the stuff is coming in that's where the jet
[39:33.680 --> 39:37.520]  stream uh... goes from a higher altitude and dumps in at the lower altitude and that's
[39:37.520 --> 39:41.640]  where we predicted three weeks ago you'd see the first signs of this and it's in the drinking
[39:41.640 --> 39:47.480]  water as well and they're not telling people filter the water they're not telling people
[39:47.480 --> 39:53.080]  uh... get bottled water from out of state uh... they're not telling people or cities
[39:53.080 --> 39:57.800]  that they should be testing it further they're not saying don't drink the milk and i'm sorry
[39:57.800 --> 40:02.280]  for dairy producers on the west coast but i mean come on come on uh... the feds aren't
[40:02.280 --> 40:06.800]  even testing it the states have tested it and found higher levels and and there's now telling
[40:06.800 --> 40:10.400]  us they're just going to raise the levels and just forget about it and people flying
[40:10.400 --> 40:16.440]  in from uh... japan to u.s. airports for two and a half weeks have been covered in radiation
[40:16.440 --> 40:19.920]  and they don't even take their shoes away from them that have the most of it on it uh...
[40:19.920 --> 40:23.960]  they just tell them go on into the u.s. and so the policy is just don't worry about any
[40:23.960 --> 40:29.040]  of this uh... toyota did uh... last week come out and put out a little advisory to those
[40:29.040 --> 40:36.280]  that had just bought cars and saying there could be radiation in your car uh... because
[40:36.280 --> 40:42.160]  of the fallout over there uh... it's it's just incredible that all of this is going
[40:42.160 --> 40:49.160]  on and that the media is playing it down and and and this is a big deal and uh... how
[40:49.160 --> 40:54.520]  many apples go on your store shelves from california how many strawberries uh... how
[40:54.520 --> 40:59.840]  much milk i mean there are literally hundreds of different produce products that come out
[40:59.840 --> 41:05.360]  of california that produces a lot of our food a lot of really good food everything from
[41:05.360 --> 41:11.160]  artichokes to green beans to blueberries i mean you name it it's grown their grapes
[41:11.160 --> 41:17.200]  i mean the list it just goes on and on uh... wine uh... that's being picked right now
[41:17.200 --> 41:22.240]  and and people to drink in this wine in couple years from now a lot of the radiation breakdown
[41:22.240 --> 41:28.880]  by them it'll still have the toxic effects of these chemicals it's it's it's it's basically
[41:28.880 --> 41:34.120]  immeasurable as the plant radiation monitor said today that the levels are immeasurable
[41:34.120 --> 41:38.080]  a radiation monitor in trouble Fukushima dashi nuclear power plant says workers they're
[41:38.080 --> 41:44.000]  exposed to immeasurable levels of radiation the monitor told nk nhk that uh... no one
[41:44.000 --> 41:47.840]  can enter the plants number one or three reactor buildings because radiation levels are so
[41:47.840 --> 41:52.920]  high that monitoring devices have been rendered useless it's off the charts uh... but they're
[41:52.920 --> 41:58.580]  dumping into the ocean seven point five million times at least safe levels uh... he said even
[41:58.580 --> 42:05.080]  levels outside the building exceed one hundred million seabirds uh... and it continues uh...
[42:05.080 --> 42:10.120]  pools and streams of water contaminated with highly radioactive uh... isotopes are being
[42:10.120 --> 42:14.880]  found throughout the facility uh... the monitor says he takes measurements as soon as he finds
[42:14.880 --> 42:19.120]  water because he can't determine whether it's contaminated just by looking at it he said
[42:19.120 --> 42:23.440]  he's very worried about the safety of workers there contaminated water and efforts to remove
[42:23.440 --> 42:28.720]  it have been hampered uh... much uh... needed work to cool the reactors the monitor expressed
[42:28.720 --> 42:34.960]  frustration linking the situation to looking up mountains that one has declined without
[42:34.960 --> 42:41.120]  being taken a single step it's just that high uh... here's another new york times article
[42:41.120 --> 42:47.520]  uh... u s c's array of new threats in japan's nuclear plant continued meltdowns explosions
[42:47.520 --> 42:52.600]  unable to uh... plug all the different leaks from the explosions she got pipes going into
[42:52.600 --> 43:00.480]  the containment areas breach containment uh... it just goes uh... on and on and the likelihood
[43:00.480 --> 43:06.440]  of more explosions uh... the report on that uh... japan has plugged one uncontrolled leak
[43:06.440 --> 43:11.680]  from the nuclear plant for now that's some good news out of a fp tapco to inject nitrogen
[43:11.680 --> 43:17.360]  into number one reactor to prevent explosion that's japan today uh... that's just some
[43:17.360 --> 43:24.960]  of what we have there okay i'm gonna go to your calls now for the balance of the hour
[43:24.960 --> 43:30.960]  and then lindsay williams is going to be uh... joining us because of course uh... he said
[43:30.960 --> 43:35.720]  six months ago october twenty second here uh... that's uh... his inside sources would
[43:35.720 --> 43:40.840]  uh... that there was to be destabilization in the middle east to then drive a smoke screen
[43:40.840 --> 43:45.400]  for decoupling the dollar is the world reserve currency that would come after oil rose from
[43:45.400 --> 43:49.760]  a hundred and fifty to two hundred dollars a barrel from where it was sixty five dollars
[43:49.760 --> 43:54.200]  a barrel at the time brent crude today is a hundred and twenty two dollars and rising
[43:54.200 --> 43:57.880]  towards the hundred and fifty mark he predicted and they're reporting it could go to two hundred
[43:57.880 --> 44:01.760]  to three hundred uh... according to top analyst oil prices could rocket two hundred three
[44:01.760 --> 44:06.080]  hundred a barrel in the world's top crude exporter saudi arabia is hit by serious political
[44:06.080 --> 44:10.840]  unrest former saudi oil minister uh... told writers and they've got other analysts basically
[44:10.840 --> 44:16.240]  saying the same thing also ron paul announces that he will be saying he was gonna run or
[44:16.240 --> 44:21.680]  not run in the next month uh... here on areas today they got picked up by politico u s a
[44:21.680 --> 44:27.600]  today uh... the hill and others we're gonna go over more of that also other commodities
[44:27.600 --> 44:31.520]  like gold hitting another record high same with silver we're gonna be breaking that down
[44:31.520 --> 44:36.120]  as well but right now let's go ahead and go to your phone calls wilson just hung up he
[44:36.120 --> 44:42.040]  was next so let's go to adam in pennsylvania adam you're on the air thank you for taking
[44:42.040 --> 44:47.120]  my call sir it's going to speak with you pleasure to talk to you um... i just had a question
[44:47.120 --> 44:52.320]  uh... regarding a court case that began yesterday uh... involving nine eleven you had spoken
[44:52.320 --> 44:57.160]  to a young lady named april gallup uh... back in two thousand eight regarding her account
[44:57.160 --> 45:01.880]  is what happened at the pentagon yes she was one of the only survivors where the uh... missile
[45:01.880 --> 45:08.920]  hit at the pentagon that's correct i just was wondering if you had any general comments
[45:08.920 --> 45:15.680]  on the court case if you have spoken to miss gallup since then no but she uh... it would
[45:15.680 --> 45:19.920]  be good to get her on i know we've had some of uh... her associates on since then but
[45:19.920 --> 45:25.920]  april gallup is a good person to get back on okay now one other question uh... in the
[45:25.920 --> 45:30.760]  the suit it's a gallup versus cheney who was called a mires uh... why wasn't president
[45:30.760 --> 45:35.680]  bush and for that matter the majority of his administration included in the suit because
[45:35.680 --> 45:41.040]  most of the experts who've really studied including myself it looks like bush was running
[45:41.040 --> 45:46.040]  around scared and was out of the loop cheney was in command of the operation in the bunker
[45:46.040 --> 45:53.720]  according to uh... uh... norman manetta uh... and others and we have the stand-down order
[45:53.720 --> 46:01.000]  from june of that year taking the default power for brass to shoot down hijacked aircraft
[46:01.000 --> 46:04.600]  that were going to be used as weapons or that were going to crash into populated areas
[46:04.600 --> 46:10.600]  she also have that they then rescinded that stand-down order a week after nine eleven
[46:10.600 --> 46:14.440]  okay uh... and just one follow-up thing on the article i originally read it was on nine
[46:14.440 --> 46:20.120]  eleven truth dot org um... as of that article being published on march twenty four i have
[46:20.120 --> 46:24.200]  not seen anything in mainstream media or even local news in new haven can etiquette addressing
[46:24.200 --> 46:29.720]  the court case or is that deliberate that they're not speaking about it absolutely they don't
[46:29.720 --> 46:34.680]  want a survivor uh... who had her baby there that day they let them have their baby a couple
[46:34.680 --> 46:39.360]  days a year com your children uh... with the secretaries and she barely survived and was
[46:39.360 --> 46:45.400]  basically told to shut up and it's a key piece of uh... testimony and we're gonna work on
[46:45.400 --> 46:49.520]  getting her on uh... the producers are listening and i give the green light to that thank you
[46:49.520 --> 46:53.600]  adam i'm happy to get a question is we're open phones is anybody want to talk about
[46:53.600 --> 46:57.320]  the cover up the radiation and the media and the government saying they're gonna raise
[46:57.320 --> 47:03.640]  safe levels uh... and i'm not scolding you i'm glad you brought that up but i hope somebody
[47:03.640 --> 47:07.760]  is concerned about this radiation and the fact that the government's covering the sub
[47:07.760 --> 47:11.440]  uh... let's go to richard and vermont richard you're on the air
[47:11.440 --> 47:13.840]  hi alex how you doing good
[47:13.840 --> 47:21.320]  okay uh... in the new york new york times in the asia pacific uh... section from yesterday's
[47:21.320 --> 47:29.440]  paper article by james glance and william j broad uh... from april fifth name of the
[47:29.440 --> 47:35.560]  article is u s sees a ray of new threats at japan's nuclear plant yeah i just mentioned
[47:35.560 --> 47:43.120]  that yeah okay and they don't get to this is one of those footnote things that they
[47:43.120 --> 47:49.920]  just happen to throw in their seventh paragraph down okay now when you and i saw that i i actually
[47:49.920 --> 47:53.520]  was a guy that called you and told you that they had blown plutonium rods all over the
[47:53.520 --> 47:57.680]  place after we were trying to figure out what was coming out of that three thousand foot
[47:57.680 --> 48:01.920]  clouds that's right you're a former nuclear worker you've called before right
[48:01.920 --> 48:10.160]  yeah yeah okay down in regards to three weeks and four days ago when i called you and i
[48:10.160 --> 48:13.960]  were sure that we saw stuff get flying out of that well they admit they were storing
[48:13.960 --> 48:19.600]  644 thousand rods on top of these facilities and it was clearly rods i said that the day
[48:19.600 --> 48:24.400]  i saw it that monday you know three days into the event i said looks like fuel rods and
[48:24.400 --> 48:28.480]  it turns out here it is the document also suggested fragments or particles of nuclear
[48:28.480 --> 48:34.040]  fuel from spent fuel rods above the reactors were blown up to one mile from the units yeah
[48:34.040 --> 48:38.240]  it was three thousand feet tall because i looked up those towers or a thousand feet
[48:38.240 --> 48:43.080]  was at least at least three times taller than those and yeah they're saying right here in
[48:43.080 --> 48:48.960]  their reports uh... that it splattered or fuel rods up to a mile away yeah pieces of
[48:48.960 --> 48:54.000]  highly reactive or radioactive material fell between two of the units which doesn't that
[48:54.000 --> 48:58.360]  make it a nice cozy little place in there between two of the units we know for a fact
[48:58.360 --> 49:03.440]  that it had blown within a mile and i don't know if you recall or if you ever saw one
[49:03.440 --> 49:13.040]  of the examples that they give on how radiation spreads they put a room full of mice trap
[49:13.040 --> 49:17.400]  mouse traps and they have a ping pong ball set on instead of a piece of cheese on each
[49:17.400 --> 49:22.200]  one of those and they take one ping pong ball and they throw it into the middle of the room
[49:22.200 --> 49:28.040]  and within a matter of seconds all the rest of the mouse mouse mice traps in the room
[49:28.040 --> 49:33.480]  all fire off and the ping pong balls are flying all over the place well what happens
[49:33.480 --> 49:40.240]  when that stuff hits this when particularly plutonium plutonium isotopes hit the soil
[49:40.240 --> 49:44.960]  all right now this is spread around within a mile those things spread each molecule of
[49:44.960 --> 49:50.320]  dirt spread it on to the next molecule of dirt and it just starts spreading out farther
[49:50.320 --> 49:56.800]  and farther and for them to pull those over these things it's like having a field of landmines
[49:56.800 --> 50:02.280]  and you don't even have to step on well sure i mean for for uh... billions of years the
[50:02.280 --> 50:08.280]  radioactive half-life of uranium's four-and-a-half bill uh... on average depending on the variant
[50:08.280 --> 50:12.560]  of it from what we've seen and the fizzes we've had on and it's going to be leaching
[50:12.560 --> 50:18.280]  into the soil the water table the ocean uh... and and that's what we said when when when
[50:18.280 --> 50:23.160]  when number one blew up uh... on saturday we wrote an article curtain emmo did
[50:23.160 --> 50:27.040]  uh... and then we link to other articles that drudge picked up uh... from some of our
[50:27.040 --> 50:31.400]  auxiliary riders where we said looks like fuel rods were blown sky high
[50:31.400 --> 50:34.920]  i'm not bragging it just we don't make stuff up here and then monday
[50:34.920 --> 50:38.360]  the mox three uh... number three blue sky high
[50:38.360 --> 50:42.360]  and i mean clearly that damaged the core and later they admitted yet damaged the core
[50:42.360 --> 50:46.400]  that explosion look like a nuke went off i mean of course it damaged the core
[50:46.400 --> 50:50.120]  uh... and and this stuff is spreading it's terrible richard uh... you want to add
[50:50.120 --> 50:52.680]  anything else after the break are you done
[50:52.680 --> 50:55.200]  uh... no go ahead and go to your break out pretty well done

[51:11.720 --> 51:15.920]  united states and could lead to millions of americans becoming homeless all
[51:15.920 --> 51:20.080]  caused by the devalued u.s. dollar all the mainstream media continues to ignore

[54:35.840 --> 54:41.320]  of radioactive poisons into the pacific ocean this new york times article does
[54:41.320 --> 54:45.800]  have buried that the government in japanese report says that they did spray
[54:45.800 --> 54:49.880]  fuel rods everywhere that they're just bulldozing upwards of a mile away not
[54:49.880 --> 54:52.840]  even picking them up they're just burying them on the spot i mean this is
[54:52.840 --> 54:57.520]  insane not even marking where they're at this just shows the ham-fisted not
[54:57.520 --> 55:01.600]  caring attitude of these people and why not they can just say radiation is now
[55:01.600 --> 55:06.880]  good for you and raise it 25,000 times with one isotope 10,000 times with
[55:06.880 --> 55:11.000]  another and that's all in the news the epa just calmly reporting it like it's
[55:11.000 --> 55:14.720]  no big deal and then we're the alarmist conspiracy theorist for being concerned
[55:14.720 --> 55:17.960]  later in the third hour i'll talk about this a little bit but i want to go to

[55:33.720 --> 55:38.960]  report right now it's the top link a big headline back out at fox and this is
[55:38.960 --> 55:45.000]  exactly how i predicted they would do it it's like when they took gibson i've
[55:45.000 --> 55:48.000]  been a guest on his show and his radio show when they took gibson new york
[55:48.000 --> 55:55.800]  times also has it back to in daily fox news program and what they're doing is
[55:55.800 --> 56:00.000]  this is how they transition you off he's going to go basically to a weekend
[56:00.000 --> 56:04.840]  show or special reports with glenn beck that you see occasionally and that's
[56:04.840 --> 56:08.840]  basically what they've done with people like alan combs when they kicked him
[56:08.840 --> 56:13.840]  off hannity and combs and it just became hannity that he does specials and
[56:13.840 --> 56:17.480]  is a contributor to some of the shows and so he said on his radio program
[56:17.480 --> 56:23.040]  today that they are phasing that he's being phased out and transitioned off
[56:23.040 --> 56:28.240]  fox now i have three sources inside fox i was going to leave it at that and i
[56:28.240 --> 56:34.400]  knew over a month and a half ago that the word was that the only person
[56:34.400 --> 56:37.560]  keeping back there was roger rails and that it was being looked at that beck
[56:37.560 --> 56:45.800]  would be gone and that his ratings had dropped by about 35 percent in the last
[56:45.800 --> 56:49.840]  year and we're continuing in freefall then last week the numbers came out that
[56:49.840 --> 56:55.040]  he fell even more on tv still two million viewers still more than cnn and
[56:55.040 --> 57:01.640]  msnbc combined with their bigger shows the the the real reason he's being run
[57:01.640 --> 57:08.640]  out of fox is the fact that media matters george soros funded took and in
[57:08.640 --> 57:12.680]  brags that they basically were instrumental in running off 400 plus
[57:12.680 --> 57:16.520]  sponsors and now the memos have been released two weeks ago out of politico
[57:16.520 --> 57:22.760]  that media matters job is to sabotage and destroy fox period so i think fox has
[57:22.760 --> 57:25.800]  made a big mistake here because now they're just going to turn their guns
[57:25.800 --> 57:29.400]  on hannity and others and even though i don't particularly like these guys as
[57:29.400 --> 57:33.680]  phony conservatives it's it's they're better than george soros any day of the
[57:33.680 --> 57:39.440]  week they'll at least be pro-gun and talk about cutting taxes and beck would
[57:39.440 --> 57:42.160]  talk about the federal reserve in the new world order he was a lot better than
[57:42.160 --> 57:46.560]  them i would have loved to be able to support beck as a lesser of evils
[57:46.560 --> 57:52.560]  compared to something like msnbc but he privately did stuff to to mess with my
[57:52.560 --> 57:57.080]  show and to keep people off his guest and threaten and try to keep me off fox
[57:57.080 --> 58:04.480]  news and so it's it's it's it's infuriating but i'm not happy about
[58:04.480 --> 58:09.840]  this he's gained 88 stations the last year the media says who he's lost seven
[58:09.840 --> 58:13.120]  like he's losing affiliates you always lose and gain affiliates they change
[58:13.120 --> 58:17.960]  formats program directors have new ideas his shows growing he's doing better in
[58:17.960 --> 58:21.720]  radio than ever and that's where his big audiences he's only got two million on
[58:21.720 --> 58:27.480]  fox he's got about six seven million a day over 11 million a week and though i
[58:27.480 --> 58:31.720]  find him disingenuous and distasteful and very deceptive towards myself
[58:31.720 --> 58:37.880]  playing edited tapes of me and things on air still this is not good this is not
[58:37.880 --> 58:50.640]  goodness this is gcn the genesis communications radio network diamond

[01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:11.080]  hi alex keep up the good work i appreciate everything you're doing but i
[01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:16.760]  have a couple questions actually i'm in the military and i keep trying to tell
[01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:20.080]  these guys about radiation poisoning and everything like that because we're
[01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:25.120]  actually a squadron our sister squadron gun to japan and everyone thinks it's a
[01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:29.480]  joke but those really the aircraft carriers ran out of the area and they've
[01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:33.160]  been evacuating u.s. troops all the way to the south i mean that's been on record
[01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:37.240]  for two weeks but your guys think it's a joke yeah everyone everyone they're
[01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:40.760]  laughing about it you know radiation that that's not going to affect us and i
[01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:45.920]  keep treating you know keep telling them but you know my grandfather it's use
[01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:50.080]  cooper talks on his cows so flies wouldn't bite him and my dad would say
[01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:53.560]  when his little kid he said daddy this has cyanide in it it has a skull and
[01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:57.960]  crossbones it says you got to wear a mask and wash yourself after daddy don't
[01:01:57.960 --> 01:02:02.440]  breathe that he'd say son i'm i'm tough you know he was you know you're rough
[01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:06.880]  outdoorsman guy he said i'll be fine and of course it gave him bone cancer and
[01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:13.200]  lung cancer but so young guys think they're bulletproof yeah and i was
[01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:16.520]  wondering i'm i've been trying to look on google and everything that you said
[01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:20.000]  uh the states and putting out radiation levels and i haven't find anything on
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:24.720]  florida do you know anything if they're finding radiation no i've seen it in
[01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:30.960]  more than 20 states massachusetts california novata just put the name of
[01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:36.600]  your florida florida reports minuscule or low level increase that's usually the
[01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:40.600]  spin i haven't seen them report that in florida but i've seen it in more than
[01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:44.520]  20 states just minor footnotes that oh by the way there's some increased
[01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:48.360]  radiation it's safe and now that it's going up levels that aren't safe
[01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:51.600]  according to their old measurement they just say well we're raising what's safe
[01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:57.960]  then so uh i mean if the government comes out and says cyanide safe to eat i
[01:02:57.960 --> 01:03:03.240]  wouldn't eat it see what i'm saying yeah because um well it just gives us
[01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:06.480]  really frustrating out because i'm trying to you know open these guys eyes up
[01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:11.360]  because it's actually you know talk about the tough guy thing it when i was
[01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:14.160]  talking about libya and all things are going on libya and i was actually
[01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:19.080]  showing these guys reports directly from you know msnb cn and all this stuff
[01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:22.680]  but you know them using du bombs and everything like that and everyone's
[01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:27.640]  calling me you know i'm it you know i'm scared you know i'm a i'm a you know i'm
[01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:30.920]  a hippie i'm against you know the military i'm not a hard-ass you know all
[01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:34.360]  that good stuff like that and they don't understand that
[01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:38.120]  we're taking over a sovereign nation and they just think you know it's another
[01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:41.560]  you know these are bad guys and we must you know kill them all and
[01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:45.320]  if you if you're not with that you're against us
[01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:48.360]  well i remember
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:52.600]  in the last few weeks seeing a lot of former military people on the news
[01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:56.680]  saying it's a bad idea and hearing current military calling in saying
[01:03:56.680 --> 01:04:00.840]  that the mission's not defined and that they're backing al-qaeda and that's wrong
[01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:04.440]  and a lot of congressmen and people talked about it
[01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:07.400]  even the secretary of defense three weeks ago said he didn't think it was a
[01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:10.680]  very good idea so sounds like some of the guys in your
[01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:13.640]  you say in your squadron are you in the air force
[01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:20.440]  uh no sir i'm in the navy okay but so so they're not concerned well i i don't
[01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:22.920]  know what to say i mean i always thought it was
[01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:26.680]  important and intelligent to be concerned and to weigh things and to discuss
[01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:29.160]  things it doesn't mean you don't follow orders as long as
[01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:32.600]  they're lawful orders but to but to talk about
[01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:37.960]  radiation concerns doesn't mean you're a wimp i mean that's that's bizarre but
[01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:40.840]  unfortunately they'll find out people think they could smoke a pack of cigarettes
[01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:45.000]  and get away with it and on average take about 20 years off your life
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:48.600]  just it just shows people think they're bulletproof but
[01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:52.040]  let me tell you time has a way of showing folks that they weren't bulletproof
[01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:56.520]  and that's just it's that's the foolishness of youth
[01:04:56.520 --> 01:05:00.520]  a lot of good things come with youth but also a lot of bad things
[01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:04.040]  alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over
[01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:09.240]  it ended on june of 2009 the millions of americans unable to find work might not
[01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:13.240]  agree perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees but
[01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:15.800]  for the rest of us things seem to be getting worse

[01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:28.360]  get to all of you but if you have a question for
[01:08:28.360 --> 01:08:32.040]  lynsey williams about the middle east about commodity and oil prices
[01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:35.880]  increasing you're welcome to stay if not i'd ask you to please disconnect
[01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:42.280]  so others can call in at 1-800-259-9231 then you'll be welcome
[01:08:42.280 --> 01:08:45.240]  to call back in the third hour we have open phones for everybody and go
[01:08:45.240 --> 01:08:50.280]  through a lot of important news pastor lynsey williams
[01:08:50.280 --> 01:08:56.440]  going back three years ago plus said oil will go from 60 dollars a barrel
[01:08:56.440 --> 01:09:00.680]  to 150 in the next six months everybody laughed at him but me
[01:09:00.680 --> 01:09:05.080]  it went up to 150 then he said now it's going to go down to 40
[01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:09.160]  everybody laughed again it went down to 40 exactly as he said
[01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:14.760]  on the exact same time frame and he then said two years ago he said enjoy
[01:09:14.760 --> 01:09:20.280]  yourself it's going to stay at 60 or thereabouts for two years
[01:09:20.280 --> 01:09:25.960]  but then when it starts going back up it will then race up to 150 or higher
[01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:29.400]  perhaps 200 now he wasn't looking into tea leaves
[01:09:29.400 --> 01:09:35.400]  or runes or a crystal ball at a roadside gypsy shack
[01:09:35.400 --> 01:09:39.880]  he wasn't consulting the easter bunny or doing seances
[01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:43.880]  he worked as the head chaplain that's a key position just like in congress
[01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:46.840]  or just like on an aircraft carrier the chaplain's the only person that can
[01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:49.880]  walk in and talk to the admiral or the captain whenever they want
[01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:53.160]  and it's a liaison to the men throughout history
[01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:57.640]  he was out there running his own charter company of aircraft on the side
[01:09:57.640 --> 01:10:01.160]  preaching they liked him brought him up to the
[01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:04.440]  you know what they called the Atlantic Richfield Hilton their own
[01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:08.040]  you know private hotel for the elites put him in there
[01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:12.120]  for years and he became the chaplain and sat in on
[01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:17.880]  inner oil company board meetings as the liaison to the work crews because he
[01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:21.080]  decreased the prostitution the alcoholism the fighting
[01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:26.040]  and he was their guide and he wrote a book the energy non crisis how there was
[01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:28.600]  more oil in Alaska discovered than Saudi Arabia and
[01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:32.120]  how they wouldn't release it now that's been declassified when he wrote it back
[01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:37.320]  in the 1980s he was laughed at but it's all confirmed now
[01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:41.000]  he wrote about the deal they done with the Arabs
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:47.080]  to have them invest all of their most their money in tea bills
[01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:51.320]  and in turn the US would keep most the oil out of the gulf
[01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:57.560]  and out of Alaska and Prudeau Bay off the market and they've done that with
[01:10:57.560 --> 01:11:00.200]  regulators that's why the the big old companies fund all the big
[01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:03.400]  environmental groups and then gripe and say they won't let us drill they're
[01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:06.920]  the ones that work for them that's just their shill their foil their minion
[01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:14.840]  their front and AP sued in 2000 and in 2001 just like
[01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:18.520]  Bloomberg sued and got the
[01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:21.800]  Federal Reserve documents that most of the trillions went to foreign banks and
[01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:25.400]  to private corporations same thing AP sued we wrote big articles about it at
[01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:28.280]  the time and then again in 2006 when more came out
[01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:32.840]  that the oil companies got together in 95 and 96 the big 10 at meetings
[01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:35.640]  and that there's the minutes of the meetings and we linked to those in the
[01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:38.120]  articles and AP again are the ones that got them
[01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:40.360]  and it was how they met and said there's too much oil
[01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:44.600]  we've already shut down most the fields in areas we don't control
[01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:48.920]  using government to create artificial scarcity
[01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:54.120]  we need to buy up all of the existing refineries that we don't own
[01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:57.640]  and shut them down and not expand our refineries
[01:11:57.640 --> 01:12:00.600]  that's how we're going to create our artificial bottleneck so there's another
[01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:03.400]  confirmed how they're doing it the oil companies
[01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:06.920]  don't want you to get the oil just like diamonds are only semi precious but
[01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:11.160]  they're geographically located so the debirrs is able on record to
[01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:14.520]  shut them down and have a 90 plus percent diamond monopoly so a diamond that
[01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:17.560]  should cost five dollars they lay on the ground in Africa
[01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:21.640]  you know cost ten thousand dollars on the scale they're semi precious it's a
[01:12:21.640 --> 01:12:26.280]  giant scam same thing with oil and lindsey then came on here six
[01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:29.720]  months ago october 22nd and he said and i'm just
[01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:33.480]  building this up so new listeners understand why this is important
[01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:39.960]  and ken from was was nearing death and so he went ahead and revealed
[01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:42.680]  ken from because then he was allowed to
[01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:45.880]  and then come from did die in december of cancer long battle
[01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:49.960]  ken from was the operations director number two at lennick richfield
[01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:53.960]  but not his main source just one of his big ones the other guy is the former
[01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:58.360]  ceo of the big three i'm we're i know his name not allowed to say
[01:12:58.360 --> 01:13:01.800]  and obviously it's a source that's how the media works again emails when why
[01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:06.520]  can't you tell us well that's how when when when homeland security people
[01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:09.800]  federal marshals send me internal documents how homeland security is
[01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:13.320]  really for the american people and it goes into 500 newspapers the next day
[01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:16.760]  and then they're saying tell us your source they would be fired if i told you
[01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:19.640]  the source that's how media works it's called sources
[01:13:19.640 --> 01:13:23.560]  now this other source we can't reveal we have revealed the other one
[01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:28.840]  because he's dead now um
[01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:33.160]  they both told him in october because he talked to from and then he called the
[01:13:33.160 --> 01:13:35.960]  other guy and he said yeah that's right and let me tell you more
[01:13:35.960 --> 01:13:39.240]  you're going to see destabilization he said war he said no crises in the
[01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:43.000]  middle east that's going to run oil up we're behind it
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:46.680]  to 150 then we're going to use that to decouple the dollar
[01:13:46.680 --> 01:13:49.640]  and to start the slide of the dollar the Arabs will be double cross because
[01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:52.680]  they've invested in the dollar and then we'll open up drilling all over
[01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:57.240]  north america but that'll take years to go online in
[01:13:57.240 --> 01:14:00.840]  that interim oil will go to 150 to 200 well roiders
[01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:06.760]  yesterday uh reports saudi arabian government others are saying 200 to
[01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:11.800]  300 a barrel brent crudes 122 today that's roiders
[01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:15.400]  gold hits new record rent oil above 122
[01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:18.680]  and everything lindsay said to happen uh lindsay williams
[01:14:18.680 --> 01:14:22.760]  my friend uh good to have you here weatherson you've got more intel
[01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:26.600]  for us now today from your source and so we're very pleased to have you
[01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:31.800]  our storms i want to congratulate you for being such a brave talk show host to
[01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:35.000]  allow me to peer on info wars over the years
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:40.520]  and say such nearly unbelievable things that my religious friends had told me
[01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:43.560]  i admire you more than you can possibly imagine
[01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:46.520]  there were other talk show hosts that wouldn't even allow me on the air
[01:14:46.520 --> 01:14:50.280]  many of them laughed at me you took me on as a friend
[01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:54.680]  and i just say congratulations because every single
[01:14:54.680 --> 01:14:58.680]  thing that they said has taken place exactly like they said you know
[01:14:58.680 --> 01:15:02.280]  i mentioned to your audience back about two years ago
[01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:06.600]  where the price of gold and silver was going do you realize that it cost
[01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:11.080]  as much today to mail an ounce of silver a silver dollar
[01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:17.960]  as it did to buy it in 1960 alex you to be congratulated i i just sit back here
[01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:23.640]  may as in it am always considered such a privilege to be on info wars
[01:15:24.360 --> 01:15:29.400]  well lindsay you've got the floor give us any new information you have
[01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:33.960]  what's happening in the middle east uh where all this is going
[01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:39.160]  well yes i have been in contact with the other mr rickson my book energy non
[01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:43.160]  crisis two different times in the past still about a week and a half
[01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:47.480]  and some of the things i've been given again it's like the information they've
[01:15:47.480 --> 01:15:52.200]  given me in the past is startling but again i may i'll say to everyone out
[01:15:52.200 --> 01:15:56.280]  there in your listening audience i take no credit for this i'm just an ordinary
[01:15:56.280 --> 01:15:59.720]  everyday guy that puts on his bridges just like any
[01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:02.760]  other man on any given day and it's by the
[01:16:02.760 --> 01:16:07.080]  providence of god that i've known all of this so that i could give it to you over
[01:16:07.080 --> 01:16:11.000]  the air here at info wars today the merciful and brotherhood
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:14.360]  i think this is probably the most critical thing that's been given to me
[01:16:14.360 --> 01:16:18.360]  just recently we are going to give or we are in
[01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:22.120]  the process of giving now this came from my source
[01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:26.600]  we are in the process of giving egypt and libya
[01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:29.880]  to the most one brotherhood i think the average person
[01:16:29.880 --> 01:16:34.840]  would not have the slightest idea as to how startling this is going to be
[01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:38.440]  because this is going to spread all over the middle east
[01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:42.680]  and i'm glad that you picked up on that on yesterday because i did also
[01:16:42.680 --> 01:16:48.440]  uh sardine radio oil minister on yesterday was interviewed on national news
[01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:54.360]  and he said that the price of crude oil is going from 200 to 300 dollars a barrel
[01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:58.120]  now if you suppose this man knows nothing about what he's talking about
[01:16:58.120 --> 01:17:02.360]  he knows things that the average person didn't have the slightest idea of the
[01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:06.360]  knowledge of and he's right now he said two to 300
[01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:09.880]  dollars a barrel i was told a number of months ago
[01:17:09.880 --> 01:17:13.960]  that it was going to 200 dollars a barrel when i heard this already a radio
[01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:18.440]  oil minister say 300 i was startled they may take it to that
[01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:23.000]  because they've got to do it in order to take the price of gold to three thousand
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.480]  dollars an ounce i hope you're hearing this
[01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:29.080]  gold and silver is such a vital part of this whole thing
[01:17:29.080 --> 01:17:34.040]  because in order to have a new world order currency
[01:17:34.040 --> 01:17:37.960]  in the future they must back it with gold and silver
[01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:42.920]  in order to do that they have got to take gold and silver to 300
[01:17:42.920 --> 01:17:48.040]  gold to 300 dollars an ounce silver to 50 to 100 dollars an ounce
[01:17:48.040 --> 01:17:52.760]  i told this on your program back oh my goodness it was nearly two years ago
[01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:55.880]  that the price of gold and silver was only going to go one way
[01:17:55.880 --> 01:18:00.360]  it's quite interesting just the other day uh in the last few days i had a phone
[01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:03.640]  call from a friend of mine who is a very prominent business man over in the
[01:18:03.640 --> 01:18:07.560]  Las Vegas area and he mentioned our conversation of
[01:18:07.560 --> 01:18:10.920]  about a year ago he said Lindsay about a year ago i called you
[01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:15.480]  and i said well i think golden silver has gone to his peak
[01:18:15.480 --> 01:18:18.840]  this business man over in Las Vegas said about a year ago
[01:18:18.840 --> 01:18:22.520]  he said golden server's got to his peak he said i think i'll sell it i'll sell
[01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:27.400]  everything i've got and i told him i said don't you dare do that
[01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:30.520]  this was a year ago now i said don't you dare sell your golden
[01:18:30.520 --> 01:18:33.960]  silver i said you're going to keep going up he said no no no i think it's
[01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:36.840]  leveled out and it's gotten about as high as it's going
[01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:39.960]  i said no it's not i said it's going to keep going right up
[01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:44.040]  well i talked to him the other day and he said chaplain Williams why i'm so glad
[01:18:44.040 --> 01:18:48.520]  i took your advice he said if i sold my gold and silver a year ago because i
[01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:52.280]  thought it'd reach the peak i said would you haven't seen anything yet
[01:18:52.280 --> 01:18:56.200]  i said you're going to see gold go to three thousand dollars an ounce
[01:18:56.200 --> 01:18:59.800]  you're going to see silver continue to climb and
[01:18:59.800 --> 01:19:05.160]  it's amazing how people some people and you in particular alex have been
[01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:08.600]  willing to accept this information that the elitist have given me over the
[01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:12.280]  years and as a result every single time it's been
[01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:17.160]  exact as they said now what's going to happen in the middle east
[01:19:17.160 --> 01:19:23.800]  Egypt and Libya both are being given did you hear this i just got this
[01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:28.520]  Egypt and Libya both are being given to the muslim brotherhood now right now
[01:19:28.520 --> 01:19:32.760]  Egypt does not have a government the eastern shambles
[01:19:32.760 --> 01:19:37.640]  wait till september they're going to elect a new government stay there and
[01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:41.720]  notice now alberidae who's admittedly you and menion has said
[01:19:41.720 --> 01:19:46.120]  we they might have war with israel so we so we see this stabilization program
[01:19:46.120 --> 01:19:49.560]  they admit al qaeda is the core of the group now al qaeda is the good guys if
[01:19:49.560 --> 01:19:53.240]  you don't like al qaeda you're unamerican well but i'm unamerican
[01:19:53.240 --> 01:19:56.520]  by no lindsay williams doesn't like al qaeda either the muslim brotherhood is
[01:19:56.520 --> 01:19:59.960]  british intelligence globally stabilization program now going into
[01:19:59.960 --> 01:20:04.520]  high gear dr david berry has provided excellent advice for all those interested

[01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:21.160]  that he launched months ago lindsay williams will be with us a little bit in

[01:24:25.480 --> 01:24:31.480]  25 at 9 92 31 uh lindsay you've also been attacked a lot
[01:24:31.480 --> 01:24:36.040]  from from mainstream media alternative because you've been so right
[01:24:36.040 --> 01:24:39.560]  and and that's another indicator i know who your sources are ken
[01:24:39.560 --> 01:24:43.880]  froms now public because he's died the other guy's even bigger i know his name
[01:24:43.880 --> 01:24:47.320]  i know people that have talked to him and confirmed this uh i haven't attempted
[01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:50.840]  to call him i know your other source former CEO
[01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:54.680]  of a big three and the proof is in the pudding of what you said now that
[01:24:54.680 --> 01:24:57.960]  you got cut off by the break you were getting into handing it over
[01:24:57.960 --> 01:25:01.640]  to the muslim brotherhood uh the headline the wall street journal was
[01:25:01.640 --> 01:25:07.160]  muja hadin al-qaeda are the core are the core of these groups so
[01:25:07.160 --> 01:25:10.600]  just like they use them to take over the serbs in kosovo they used them against
[01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:14.680]  the russians they're just switching back to their old game with al-qaeda
[01:25:14.680 --> 01:25:18.120]  just like amiral alaki the head of al-qaeda secretly hangs out at the
[01:25:18.120 --> 01:25:22.200]  pentagon sourced fox news ap getting orders i mean he's the guy running all
[01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:25.640]  these domestic attacks they this is their weapon
[01:25:25.640 --> 01:25:29.720]  and it's so diabolical the average person has trouble understanding it
[01:25:29.720 --> 01:25:33.800]  uh but but you were getting into this program of destabilization that you
[01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:36.440]  predicted through your source with precision
[01:25:36.440 --> 01:25:43.160]  october 22nd last year six months ago i hope uh alex that you have some of the
[01:25:43.160 --> 01:25:46.440]  middle east kings and rarer families listen to you
[01:25:46.440 --> 01:25:50.120]  are sure today because the next item that i've been given just
[01:25:50.120 --> 01:25:54.280]  recently is so startling that but again you remember the day that i said it was
[01:25:54.280 --> 01:25:58.440]  going from 147 dollars a barrel to 30 to 50 dollars a barrel
[01:25:58.440 --> 01:26:02.200]  and talk to your host around the country laughed at me you were willing to at
[01:26:02.200 --> 01:26:06.520]  least accept what i said because lindsay if it didn't come out to be true
[01:26:06.520 --> 01:26:10.280]  it just meant that your sources double cost you i mean stan monteef's talk to
[01:26:10.280 --> 01:26:14.200]  your sources i know who they are i've read your book he wrote in 81
[01:26:14.200 --> 01:26:18.680]  i mean you you were on record working there it was on record that uh from got
[01:26:18.680 --> 01:26:22.200]  fired when your book came out and then rehired
[01:26:22.200 --> 01:26:26.120]  well it's now on record i hope that's off your show today
[01:26:26.120 --> 01:26:30.360]  if any of the middle east kings and rarer families are listening
[01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:36.280]  you're on your way out uh first of all it was mubarak in egypt and then it's
[01:26:36.280 --> 01:26:39.960]  to daffy in libya he's just a little more stubborn it's going to take a
[01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:43.240]  longer to get him out of there then it's going to be one
[01:26:43.240 --> 01:26:49.560]  country after the other syria Bahrain yehman now these guys always use buzzwords
[01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:54.200]  when they said destabilization and when they said the prices were going to go
[01:26:54.200 --> 01:26:58.440]  up and that things were going to change we now see what that is and when they
[01:26:58.440 --> 01:27:00.680]  told you they're going to double cross the arab's
[01:27:00.680 --> 01:27:04.440]  that's what you're saying is that's not now they've told you that's not just
[01:27:04.440 --> 01:27:07.960]  cheating them out of their t-bills that means basically backing their
[01:27:07.960 --> 01:27:11.080]  overthrow as well they are going to be over thrown
[01:27:11.080 --> 01:27:14.920]  mark my words the royal families in the middle east
[01:27:14.920 --> 01:27:19.320]  the all barons one after the other are going to be over thrown
[01:27:19.320 --> 01:27:23.240]  until they have done exactly what they want to do they did it in egypt
[01:27:23.240 --> 01:27:27.720]  and now we have given egypt to the muslim brother do you realize that the
[01:27:27.720 --> 01:27:32.440]  muslim brotherhood is jihad they're going to put into real law
[01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:37.480]  do you by the way uh no stop stop stop uh uh the egyptian government ban

[01:30:23.240 --> 01:30:27.640]  grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[01:30:27.640 --> 01:30:31.080]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[01:30:31.080 --> 01:30:34.680]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power

[01:36:18.440 --> 01:36:22.040]  shut up sit back i just want to add i looked it up you're seeing your inside
[01:36:22.040 --> 01:36:26.040]  source says she went to eastern libya they're reporting she's had a bunch of
[01:36:26.040 --> 01:36:29.480]  meetings the last three weeks in europe and london's
[01:36:29.480 --> 01:36:32.680]  closed meetings with the muslim brotherhood and quote the libyan rebel
[01:36:32.680 --> 01:36:35.240]  leadership and then the head of the rebels was in the
[01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:38.200]  new york times admitting i sent people to kill americans
[01:36:38.200 --> 01:36:42.520]  so he is al-qaeda of course he's been in virginia another one for two decades
[01:36:42.520 --> 01:36:47.080]  i mean this is red handed that we're talking about so so break down recap the
[01:36:47.080 --> 01:36:49.960]  master plan where this is going your source saying they're
[01:36:49.960 --> 01:36:53.720]  going to go all the way to re-odd they're going to overthrow the king
[01:36:53.720 --> 01:36:57.880]  the king is meeting with gates uh what today
[01:36:57.880 --> 01:37:01.240]  threatening to raise the oil prices above 200 so i guess they're they're
[01:37:01.240 --> 01:37:04.840]  starting to get desperate that adds credibility to what you're saying lindsay
[01:37:04.840 --> 01:37:08.760]  you've got the floor six months ago on informers
[01:37:08.760 --> 01:37:11.880]  i said that i had just been told on the phone by
[01:37:11.880 --> 01:37:15.960]  my latest friend that there was going to be a crisis in the middle east
[01:37:15.960 --> 01:37:21.640]  it began in egypt then it went over to libya it was spread from one point of
[01:37:21.640 --> 01:37:25.480]  the middle east to the other it was a master plan
[01:37:25.480 --> 01:37:29.800]  i did not know at the time what the extent of this was going to be
[01:37:29.800 --> 01:37:34.040]  one week after the crisis in egypt my friend told me again
[01:37:34.040 --> 01:37:38.200]  everything that was going to happen and last time i was on info wars i gave that
[01:37:38.200 --> 01:37:43.720]  how that they will spread this crisis situation through the entire middle east
[01:37:43.720 --> 01:37:48.280]  how that the elite are supporting the other ones behind them with the money
[01:37:48.280 --> 01:37:52.600]  of the muslim brotherhood which is the hard it is
[01:37:52.600 --> 01:37:57.400]  yes uh sharia law but by the way that's on record that that the west is is
[01:37:57.400 --> 01:38:01.640]  funding all the rebels and starting all this so so that's on record
[01:38:01.640 --> 01:38:04.760]  and the women of america should be raising the roof
[01:38:04.760 --> 01:38:07.880]  if you say that you believe in in in women's rights
[01:38:07.880 --> 01:38:11.560]  for goodness sakes i'm just gonna start taking some action with what the muslim
[01:38:11.560 --> 01:38:14.840]  brotherhood's going to do with that little poor women in every one of these
[01:38:14.840 --> 01:38:19.480]  countries that they take over and as it was spread from place to place
[01:38:19.480 --> 01:38:23.480]  every middle okay here we go please put this down
[01:38:23.480 --> 01:38:28.200]  every middle east king every royal family is going to feral
[01:38:28.200 --> 01:38:34.520]  it's only a matter of time now the elite's timeline is the end of 2012
[01:38:34.520 --> 01:38:40.040]  they said mr. farm boy over died said that the dollar will be dead
[01:38:40.040 --> 01:38:44.040]  not non-existent but dead by the end of 2012
[01:38:44.040 --> 01:38:47.480]  that means that they have to create a number of things first of all
[01:38:47.480 --> 01:38:51.080]  they uh when they told me that though there would be a price in the middle
[01:38:51.080 --> 01:38:54.920]  east and four to five months it took place in each of first just as they
[01:38:54.920 --> 01:38:57.640]  have said it would and then it will spread through the
[01:38:57.640 --> 01:39:01.640]  entire middle east for the purpose of getting crude oil to the price where
[01:39:01.640 --> 01:39:04.920]  they want it to go i want to be clear the purpose is not to give
[01:39:04.920 --> 01:39:07.960]  freedom to the people i mean who likes mubarak they're putting
[01:39:07.960 --> 01:39:12.440]  something in worse banning protest bringing in the modesty police we just
[01:39:12.440 --> 01:39:16.600]  put that headline up earlier uh they're they're getting rid of qaddafi
[01:39:16.600 --> 01:39:21.240]  putting in al-qaeda uh they're they're going to put even worse people in
[01:39:21.240 --> 01:39:25.160]  sir last week our secretary of state irrick lind actually met with the
[01:39:25.160 --> 01:39:28.600]  muslim brotherhood uh she met that for the purpose
[01:39:28.600 --> 01:39:32.120]  of guaranteeing them that each country that they take over
[01:39:32.120 --> 01:39:35.240]  they will have the government of that country
[01:39:35.240 --> 01:39:39.320]  mark my words you are going to see the muslim brotherhood put in in september
[01:39:39.320 --> 01:39:44.040]  whatever they have the elections in each once qaddafi is removed out of
[01:39:44.040 --> 01:39:47.080]  bolivia the muslim brotherhood will take over
[01:39:47.080 --> 01:39:52.120]  this is being done but the it to me is so interesting how the elite create a
[01:39:52.120 --> 01:39:56.520]  crisis and then create a solution they're going to use the muslim brotherhood
[01:39:56.520 --> 01:40:00.600]  over a long period of time it takes them to accomplish what they were
[01:40:00.600 --> 01:40:03.880]  and they will be scuttled again in the end
[01:40:03.880 --> 01:40:07.960]  because the whole thing turns out with the new world order over a period of
[01:40:07.960 --> 01:40:11.400]  years bringing about total control over the face of the
[01:40:11.400 --> 01:40:15.880]  earth now watch this spread you're going to see it spread everywhere
[01:40:15.880 --> 01:40:21.240]  last please watch this the last place that the muslim brotherhood will take
[01:40:21.240 --> 01:40:25.320]  over is the royal family in saudi arabia there's a reason for this
[01:40:25.320 --> 01:40:28.280]  they want to catch all of the other countries first siria
[01:40:28.280 --> 01:40:31.800]  all of my grace is they're opening fire the government is on the people and
[01:40:31.800 --> 01:40:35.800]  killing them the same thing that happened in libya and if we say that we
[01:40:35.800 --> 01:40:40.280]  agreed disagreed with what qaddafi did in libya our government better take immediate
[01:40:40.280 --> 01:40:44.920]  action but this is an action that is not going to end
[01:40:44.920 --> 01:40:49.960]  it's nowhere near coming to a close it's going to go from country to country
[01:40:49.960 --> 01:40:53.880]  sirius killing them right a barrain you're going to have
[01:40:53.880 --> 01:40:59.880]  yamon the last place is saudi arabia the reason for this is as i was told one
[01:40:59.880 --> 01:41:04.680]  week after the first crisis in aju was to raise the price of kudal to 200
[01:41:04.680 --> 01:41:08.600]  dollars a barrel now saudi arabia's oil minister is saying
[01:41:08.600 --> 01:41:12.120]  300 dollars a barrel possible well i don't know that i haven't been told that
[01:41:12.120 --> 01:41:16.120]  but i was told 200 dollars a barrel for the purpose
[01:41:16.120 --> 01:41:21.880]  i'm going about the end result now notice this in the result saudi arabia
[01:41:21.880 --> 01:41:25.240]  supplies more crude oil to america than any other country
[01:41:25.240 --> 01:41:29.960]  and the end result is what they want with saudi arabia
[01:41:29.960 --> 01:41:34.120]  when it hits them walk my words you'll have 200 dollars a barrel you'll have
[01:41:34.120 --> 01:41:39.160]  six seven eight dollars a gallon of the gas pump my son this past weekend was in
[01:41:39.160 --> 01:41:43.080]  california he actually took a picture and brought it home to me
[01:41:43.080 --> 01:41:46.760]  four dollars and eighty three cents of the hour in
[01:41:46.760 --> 01:41:50.040]  in california but they saw fuel it last weekend
[01:41:50.040 --> 01:41:54.440]  now the end result of all of this is is to take the price of kudal where they
[01:41:54.440 --> 01:41:57.800]  want it to basically make it non available
[01:41:57.800 --> 01:42:01.320]  because of our the crisis that will take place in the middle east
[01:42:01.320 --> 01:42:04.760]  so that they can collapse the dollar don't you understand
[01:42:04.760 --> 01:42:08.840]  that the new world order is not destroying america
[01:42:08.840 --> 01:42:13.880]  the new world order is taking over america it is a matter of control and in
[01:42:13.880 --> 01:42:18.760]  order to do it they have to take the price of kudal to 200 dollars a barrel
[01:42:18.760 --> 01:42:22.520]  collapse the dollar bring it to a situation of
[01:42:22.520 --> 01:42:26.200]  having so little purchasing power by the end of 2012
[01:42:26.200 --> 01:42:30.120]  that the the government of the united states of america will have to depart on
[01:42:30.120 --> 01:42:34.040]  its debt to realize this is a long-range program
[01:42:34.040 --> 01:42:40.040]  through the end of 2012 to bring about uh basically a control of america so they
[01:42:40.040 --> 01:42:43.160]  can control the whole world after all we've had the reserve currency of the
[01:42:43.160 --> 01:42:47.480]  world for all of these years there's got to be a defect on the american debt
[01:42:47.480 --> 01:42:51.320]  right now we are in horrible trouble just listen to congress and what they're
[01:42:51.320 --> 01:42:54.200]  saying about the debt crisis they can't even
[01:42:54.200 --> 01:42:57.480]  let anything together up there whatsoever for friday
[01:42:57.480 --> 01:43:00.920]  uh being the day that the budget runs out now
[01:43:00.920 --> 01:43:05.320]  whenever the dollar collapses do you realize what's going to happen to china
[01:43:05.320 --> 01:43:08.920]  who earns one trillion dollars of our paper
[01:43:08.920 --> 01:43:13.480]  t bills and they've trusted it all of these uh kings and
[01:43:13.480 --> 01:43:17.240]  heads of state in the all producing countries of the world
[01:43:17.240 --> 01:43:21.080]  they have trusted it because there was nothing as sound as the american dollar
[01:43:21.080 --> 01:43:25.320]  and our t bills and all federal reserve issues when all of this collapses can you
[01:43:25.320 --> 01:43:27.960]  imagine what the end result of it is going to be
[01:43:27.960 --> 01:43:33.560]  is going to be a total takeover of the new world order but in order to do that
[01:43:33.560 --> 01:43:36.920]  they've got to get the price of gold to three
[01:43:36.920 --> 01:43:41.400]  hot three thousand dollars an ounce folks please please please
[01:43:41.400 --> 01:43:46.200]  i'm begging you two years ago to buy every piece of gold you could get every
[01:43:46.200 --> 01:43:48.760]  piece of silver you could get your hands on
[01:43:48.760 --> 01:43:52.600]  you haven't seen anything yet i am pleading with you i'm
[01:43:52.600 --> 01:43:55.320]  begging of you i don't care if he was fourteen
[01:43:55.320 --> 01:43:59.320]  hundred and fifty five dollars an ounce right now and silver is thirty nine
[01:43:59.320 --> 01:44:02.040]  fifty and pushing thirty it doesn't matter
[01:44:02.040 --> 01:44:06.360]  goodbye because he's going to go to three thousand dollars well lindsay
[01:44:06.360 --> 01:44:09.320]  that's what your high power currency with it
[01:44:09.320 --> 01:44:11.880]  exactly they're going to back to one world government currency with it ron
[01:44:11.880 --> 01:44:14.920]  paul said yesterday on air we're going to add this to our
[01:44:14.920 --> 01:44:19.400]  article that's linked up on drudge right now when ron paul basically
[01:44:19.400 --> 01:44:22.120]  said that he would be announcing in the next month that he's probably going to
[01:44:22.120 --> 01:44:25.320]  run for president now we're going to add to that article and update
[01:44:25.320 --> 01:44:31.880]  headline ron paul gold commodity prices signal big event economic collapse
[01:44:31.880 --> 01:44:38.040]  and uh... it's a simple rule that if you devalue the global currency the dollar
[01:44:38.040 --> 01:44:40.360]  that it isn't the gold and silver have gone up
[01:44:40.360 --> 01:44:44.280]  it just takes more of those dollars to buy that golden silver
[01:44:44.280 --> 01:44:47.240]  and it signifies the beginning of the serious
[01:44:47.240 --> 01:44:52.120]  uh... inflation and uh... ron paul agreed the one world government crowd
[01:44:52.120 --> 01:44:55.320]  the new world order crowd this is ron paul the big presidential contender
[01:44:55.320 --> 01:44:58.360]  can't uh... concurring with us
[01:44:58.360 --> 01:45:02.840]  that as they do this they need to destroy the existing orders of the world
[01:45:02.840 --> 01:45:07.240]  to bring in the new band core global one world government currency
[01:45:07.240 --> 01:45:10.360]  because things will get so bad they will offer this
[01:45:10.360 --> 01:45:14.840]  as the solution we are now entering that time of crises
[01:45:14.840 --> 01:45:19.240]  ordered out of chaos what else did your source tell you any other key tidbits
[01:45:19.240 --> 01:45:23.000]  Alex it was amazing and i said you're listening to you right now just
[01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.560]  utterly stunned because you're exactly right
[01:45:25.560 --> 01:45:29.400]  it was amazing that everything that mr. prom told me before he died
[01:45:29.400 --> 01:45:32.520]  everything that my elitist friend now is telling me
[01:45:32.520 --> 01:45:36.520]  that every single bit of it they told me two years three years ago
[01:45:36.520 --> 01:45:40.440]  back 35 years ago when mr. prom told me that they were not going to open up
[01:45:40.440 --> 01:45:44.200]  garland and the article while i refuse until they got the price of
[01:45:44.200 --> 01:45:47.240]  crude oil where they wanted to go and it's time he wouldn't tell me what that
[01:45:47.240 --> 01:45:50.120]  price was but then i found out just recently they
[01:45:50.120 --> 01:45:53.400]  wanted to go to two hundred dollars a barrel it is amazing
[01:45:53.400 --> 01:45:57.640]  that there's this single thing that these people said way back down to two
[01:45:57.640 --> 01:46:02.440]  three four five ten years ago now ron paul talking about it now the national
[01:46:02.440 --> 01:46:06.040]  newsletters of almost every single writer and then oil
[01:46:06.040 --> 01:46:09.480]  and then oil and natural gas is going to be scapegoated for this
[01:46:09.480 --> 01:46:12.760]  and they're going to force us on to the new green economy that costs two or
[01:46:12.760 --> 01:46:15.160]  three or four times even what oil does
[01:46:15.160 --> 01:46:18.680]  this is the shutdown of our industrial system the stated
[01:46:18.680 --> 01:46:22.520]  un plan the head of a nasa goddard center
[01:46:22.520 --> 01:46:25.960]  says he wants a post industrial america shut off our power
[01:46:25.960 --> 01:46:30.520]  this is how they're doing it they'll sell us less of it for a much higher price
[01:46:30.520 --> 01:46:33.640]  when they built our whole society off interstate highways
[01:46:33.640 --> 01:46:37.080]  under the eisenhower plan when you've got
[01:46:37.080 --> 01:46:41.480]  to travel to get to work when most people can't use buses or trains
[01:46:41.480 --> 01:46:44.840]  they are holding us hostage they got us dependent on oil
[01:46:44.840 --> 01:46:47.800]  and now they're shutting down the refineries they're shutting down the
[01:46:47.800 --> 01:46:50.680]  supply they have they have engineered this whole
[01:46:50.680 --> 01:46:55.000]  thing beautifully for global control and they will pose as the saviors
[01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.640]  anything else he tells you that we're going to calls
[01:46:57.640 --> 01:47:01.640]  well first of all he said that our secretary of state had met
[01:47:01.640 --> 01:47:04.840]  eury clinton had actually met with the muslim brotherhood
[01:47:04.840 --> 01:47:08.520]  and they have been guaranteed that they will be given each of the nations they
[01:47:08.520 --> 01:47:12.760]  take over what we're being served the trade by russian and dc it is
[01:47:12.760 --> 01:47:17.240]  battling to me as i hear all of this so when she met with him she said okay
[01:47:17.240 --> 01:47:20.520]  go ahead and take all these countries this never appeared on the news media
[01:47:20.520 --> 01:47:23.640]  anywhere no news person was allowed to talk with her
[01:47:23.640 --> 01:47:27.400]  after she came out of the meetings i was given a chart
[01:47:27.400 --> 01:47:30.440]  i know this is startling i haven't said this yet on your program
[01:47:30.440 --> 01:47:33.720]  i was sent a chart by my president living
[01:47:33.720 --> 01:47:38.920]  a religious friend and the chart indicated what the muslim brotherhood
[01:47:38.920 --> 01:47:42.840]  wants to do now the elite won't let them go as far as they want to go
[01:47:42.840 --> 01:47:45.880]  they're going to let them go as far as taking over everything in the middle east
[01:47:45.880 --> 01:47:50.040]  every single king want my words i haven't said this before because it's just
[01:47:50.040 --> 01:47:54.040]  this past week i got it every middle east king every royal family is going to
[01:47:54.040 --> 01:47:57.000]  be deposed they think that somehow the american
[01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:00.200]  government might stand with the people of sardinia russia no way
[01:48:00.200 --> 01:48:03.480]  you mark my words the muslim brotherhood will eventually take it over
[01:48:03.480 --> 01:48:07.720]  that'll be the last one to be taken and they will be given the muslim
[01:48:07.720 --> 01:48:11.160]  brotherhood will be given these countries because they want chaos in
[01:48:11.160 --> 01:48:13.640]  every one of them in order to cut off the oil
[01:48:13.640 --> 01:48:17.160]  supply basically as they've done in libya 1.6 million
[01:48:17.160 --> 01:48:20.600]  barrels uh it was cut off in libya from going to
[01:48:20.600 --> 01:48:24.680]  certain places in europe dot america when sardinia russia comes around the
[01:48:24.680 --> 01:48:27.480]  majority of our oil supply will be cut off every
[01:48:27.480 --> 01:48:31.000]  boot of this is a part of the plan and some people said to me
[01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:34.200]  champion Williams find the world with the elite destroy their own country they
[01:48:34.200 --> 01:48:38.040]  aren't destroying their own country beginning control
[01:48:38.040 --> 01:48:41.960]  of their own country the united states of america most of them live in america
[01:48:41.960 --> 01:48:45.560]  and beginning control of it by first of all bankrupting it
[01:48:45.560 --> 01:48:51.480]  you don't take general voters and class law until you bankrupt them first then
[01:48:51.480 --> 01:48:54.120]  you get them by way of the treasury through the
[01:48:54.120 --> 01:48:58.440]  federal reserve which is not the age and they're going to bring all 50 states
[01:48:58.440 --> 01:49:01.640]  they're going to bring all 50 states into receivership under the feds
[01:49:01.640 --> 01:49:06.280]  themself bankrupt to the imf and world bank and everything to gain back every
[01:49:06.280 --> 01:49:08.760]  bit of this is a part of a long-range plan
[01:49:08.760 --> 01:49:13.000]  devised many years ago i heard him referring to it 35 years ago when i
[01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:16.120]  sat in that business meetings and of course
[01:49:16.120 --> 01:49:19.480]  the 15 years ago began the housing crisis by the
[01:49:19.480 --> 01:49:23.480]  kids loans and the interest only loans they knew would bring about
[01:49:23.480 --> 01:49:26.840]  a housing crisis you haven't seen anything until the
[01:49:26.840 --> 01:49:31.080]  commercial real estate and it's just about to hit the fan
[01:49:31.080 --> 01:49:35.240]  commercial real estate is the next one residential real estates was brought us
[01:49:35.240 --> 01:49:38.920]  to the station uh position we are now one of the
[01:49:38.920 --> 01:49:42.680]  commercial real estate begins to fall close the banks haven't tested yet
[01:49:42.680 --> 01:49:46.520]  because they knew that the residential real estate man such bad condition
[01:49:46.520 --> 01:49:50.200]  everybody this is a part of that plan yes so that they can take it over and
[01:49:50.200 --> 01:49:52.920]  then over a period of years bring it back out on the
[01:49:52.920 --> 01:49:57.400]  auspices of the new world order and the middle east was what they told me
[01:49:57.400 --> 01:50:01.240]  is a starting point for this each of us the first place libya
[01:50:01.240 --> 01:50:05.000]  and on and on to each middle east country saudi arabia last when it does
[01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:08.120]  you better be out of here and now it sets the precedent
[01:50:08.120 --> 01:50:12.840]  now it sets the precedent where the globalist can go fund rebels to try to
[01:50:12.840 --> 01:50:16.120]  overthrow a government and then in humanitarian grounds have the new world
[01:50:16.120 --> 01:50:19.640]  order military come in and bombard that country this is the new

[01:55:19.320 --> 01:55:22.200]  sometime in the next month if he's going to do it or not but went on to say
[01:55:22.200 --> 01:55:26.840]  that he's already going ahead with the token fact that he is by agreeing to
[01:55:26.840 --> 01:55:31.560]  the debate in may so that's big news as well now going to your phone calls
[01:55:31.560 --> 01:55:36.680]  here with lindsay williams tony was first but he just hung up
[01:55:36.680 --> 01:55:41.080]  so let's go to scott john julio bobby janice and others will at least get to
[01:55:41.080 --> 01:55:44.760]  those calls with lindsay williams scott in texas questions or comments for
[01:55:44.760 --> 01:55:49.320]  lindsay williams yes thanks alex lindsay since your last interview i've
[01:55:49.320 --> 01:55:53.880]  had two big questions i've been wanting to get to you
[01:55:53.880 --> 01:55:58.440]  the first one is you know all the forecasters have been predicting the
[01:55:58.440 --> 01:56:01.560]  crash of the dollar it's absolutely certain
[01:56:01.560 --> 01:56:06.360]  do your elitist friends is this a detailed forecast
[01:56:06.360 --> 01:56:12.440]  on their part or are they saying we are going to crash the dollar in late
[01:56:12.440 --> 01:56:16.760]  2012 they said that the dollar will be dead
[01:56:16.760 --> 01:56:21.000]  by the end of 2012 i don't want to change their words
[01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:24.360]  i try to be as exact as i can with what they say
[01:56:24.360 --> 01:56:28.040]  because sometimes the things behind what they're saying
[01:56:28.040 --> 01:56:32.840]  mean a lot more than what comes to them now the dollar will not be non-existent
[01:56:32.840 --> 01:56:36.520]  and they'll make the american people desire big
[01:56:36.520 --> 01:56:40.200]  please get on their knees and beg for a new currency
[01:56:40.200 --> 01:56:46.120]  that basically is what they want to do okay and my thanks for that answer
[01:56:46.120 --> 01:56:49.080]  my next question has to do with the chinese you
[01:56:49.080 --> 01:56:55.720]  barely alluded to it last interview it almost seems as though there's a lot
[01:56:55.720 --> 01:56:59.000]  going on behind the scenes between our state department
[01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:03.240]  and china and even a possible alliance with our military
[01:57:03.240 --> 01:57:06.600]  for them to have some kind of big operation in this country i've heard
[01:57:06.600 --> 01:57:10.120]  about these bases in mexico that are empty but they're fully
[01:57:10.120 --> 01:57:13.240]  they're fully armed oh they've now signed official deals to use
[01:57:13.240 --> 01:57:16.760]  mexican and canadian troops in america for insurrection
[01:57:16.760 --> 01:57:21.880]  that's associated press toronto newspaper and auto a citizen
[01:57:21.880 --> 01:57:28.920]  okay our military normally would not allow china to overtake the country
[01:57:28.920 --> 01:57:33.400]  they would bomb their tanks or whatever is it going to be
[01:57:33.400 --> 01:57:39.400]  in the back door like as peacekeepers from what joel scousen says and from what
[01:57:39.400 --> 01:57:43.800]  lindsay's saying is it's a clash between the two the western elite correct
[01:57:43.800 --> 01:57:47.640]  lindsay are not planning on being buddies with the chinese
[01:57:47.640 --> 01:57:52.280]  the chinese the expression was made by ken from before he passed away said
[01:57:52.280 --> 01:57:55.720]  china is the big one he said watch that above everything else no matter what
[01:57:55.720 --> 01:57:58.680]  we do in the middle east north of south korea anything
[01:57:58.680 --> 01:58:01.720]  else he said watch the chinese and chinese right now angry
[01:58:01.720 --> 01:58:04.520]  they know they've been double crossed that they're going to lose over a
[01:58:04.520 --> 01:58:08.840]  trillion dollars of paper that they were told that they could trust in
[01:58:08.840 --> 01:58:13.640]  as a result i have not i will say this very emphatically i have not been told
[01:58:13.640 --> 01:58:18.120]  what the chinese will do to america but i do know that they're very angry
[01:58:18.120 --> 01:58:22.120]  and that it is uh scheduled for something watch
[01:58:22.120 --> 01:58:25.800]  china it's so important even though what's happening in the middle east
[01:58:25.800 --> 01:58:29.320]  watching china is more important than even watching over there which of course
[01:58:29.320 --> 01:58:32.040]  will go to impact america more than anything because what's already
[01:58:32.040 --> 01:58:35.800]  rabies but our prices at the gas pump are going to go where they wanted to go
[01:58:35.800 --> 01:58:42.040]  in order to all right let's see the value of it yeah we gotta go to break

[02:00:58.120 --> 02:01:01.880]  lindsay williams go ahead uh hello guys um this is a real
[02:01:01.880 --> 02:01:05.800]  privilege to be on uh with you guys i got a few comments i'd like to make and
[02:01:05.800 --> 02:01:09.720]  get lindsay's take on him and some questions uh one of my things that was
[02:01:09.720 --> 02:01:12.040]  just answered i think it was answered lindsay
[02:01:12.040 --> 02:01:15.800]  you've talked a number of times about china being the big one
[02:01:15.800 --> 02:01:19.560]  um that leaves a lot to imagination and i wonder if that ties in somehow
[02:01:19.560 --> 02:01:22.440]  with these reports you hear about chinese troops being
[02:01:22.440 --> 02:01:25.800]  you know north and south of the border but primarily south of the border well
[02:01:25.800 --> 02:01:30.600]  they did give him the panama canal uh and uh both sides of the government
[02:01:30.600 --> 02:01:33.880]  republican and democrat and all three branches went along with that
[02:01:33.880 --> 02:01:36.840]  but i mean there's a succession with the chinese invading they won't have to
[02:01:36.840 --> 02:01:40.760]  invade they own our debt they own thousands of us companies
[02:01:40.760 --> 02:01:44.680]  uh but uh go ahead with your question i'm sorry well it ties in with that and
[02:01:44.680 --> 02:01:48.280]  the reports that i've received i believe are factual with hundreds of thousands
[02:01:48.280 --> 02:01:51.960]  of un troops and foreign troops at different areas of this nation
[02:01:51.960 --> 02:01:55.560]  so that was one thing i'd like uh either you or lindsay to comment on but
[02:01:55.560 --> 02:02:00.840]  um going back uh lindsay um to back in october and i listened to everything
[02:02:00.840 --> 02:02:04.200]  that you say i know especially when you're on alec shone's programs
[02:02:04.200 --> 02:02:08.760]  you talked about it was said in there that there was i wonder if they changed
[02:02:08.760 --> 02:02:12.520]  their time frame because i remember you commented was six to nine months for the
[02:02:12.520 --> 02:02:16.120]  move and crude to be a hundred and fifty to two hundred dollars a barrel
[02:02:16.120 --> 02:02:18.920]  and then it then it seemed like maybe they were altering their time frame
[02:02:18.920 --> 02:02:22.840]  because it seemed like it was uh you know now that was 12 months and then you
[02:02:22.840 --> 02:02:28.120]  know it's maybe by the end of 2012 and then you know combine that with
[02:02:28.120 --> 02:02:31.320]  the move in in brent crude as a specifically brent crude because that
[02:02:31.320 --> 02:02:34.280]  seems to be taking off more than the new york crude which wouldn't really
[02:02:34.280 --> 02:02:37.240]  affect the united states quite so much
[02:02:37.240 --> 02:02:40.760]  lezzie well let's go back to china the greatest impact that you're going to
[02:02:40.760 --> 02:02:42.760]  see out of china then i'll get to the crude set
[02:02:42.760 --> 02:02:46.120]  of question the greatest impact you're going to see on the united states of
[02:02:46.120 --> 02:02:49.560]  america and you imagine the shows of war mart
[02:02:49.560 --> 02:02:53.160]  without a single product on them mentioned said it moved in china
[02:02:53.160 --> 02:02:57.320]  everything's made out of oil everything shipped with oil i mean it it drives up
[02:02:57.320 --> 02:03:00.440]  everything yeah that's the greatest impact china's
[02:03:00.440 --> 02:03:03.400]  going to have on america they're beginning to realize that they have been
[02:03:03.400 --> 02:03:06.920]  double crossed that the paper they're holding is going to become worthless
[02:03:06.920 --> 02:03:09.400]  i'm quite sure they've listened to alex joneshow
[02:03:09.400 --> 02:03:13.400]  they're bound to know what the the elitists are doing
[02:03:13.400 --> 02:03:18.840]  and as a result they are buying gold and silver by the tons do you realize what
[02:03:18.840 --> 02:03:23.000]  china's doing they're getting out of paper john thank you and how much do we
[02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:26.440]  know they're selling secretly yeah we've got to move quick to get to all these
[02:03:26.440 --> 02:03:29.720]  calls but folks it's in mainstream newspapers
[02:03:29.720 --> 02:03:32.840]  that they've signed deals to use foreign troops against the american people
[02:03:32.840 --> 02:03:36.520]  but no one ever calls about that i can't get any attention on it it's always the
[02:03:36.520 --> 02:03:39.640]  rumors the rumors folks the rumors are over
[02:03:39.640 --> 02:03:45.560]  they're they're it's in ottawa citizen it's in other papers i've shown them here
[02:03:45.560 --> 02:03:49.880]  with the headlines foreign military to be used inside the u.s
[02:03:49.880 --> 02:03:52.760]  i don't know how else i'm telling you it's we're admitted

[02:04:28.440 --> 02:04:33.080]  what's going on with car max and the way silver skyrocketed the thirty nine
[02:04:33.080 --> 02:04:35.400]  dollars an ounce and alex if you could ask
[02:04:35.400 --> 02:04:40.840]  max how this is going to affect one silver is near the pentacle of jp morgan's
[02:04:40.840 --> 02:04:43.720]  chase stock price which is at forty six dollars

[02:05:01.960 --> 02:05:05.960]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone
[02:05:05.960 --> 02:05:09.160]  this is our last chance to not relive history
[02:05:09.160 --> 02:05:13.160]  as we're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath
[02:05:13.160 --> 02:05:16.360]  americans at home i have a tremendous influence
[02:05:16.360 --> 02:05:20.760]  on our president and congress and they really are calling the shots i think
[02:05:20.760 --> 02:05:25.560]  it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay attention
[02:05:25.560 --> 02:05:28.840]  full of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation
[02:05:28.840 --> 02:05:33.240]  the criminal off-short cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty
[02:05:33.240 --> 02:05:36.520]  and on its ashes constructing world government tim geithner
[02:05:36.520 --> 02:05:40.280]  Bernanke and arsonists they're asking for more matches and the congress is
[02:05:40.280 --> 02:05:44.120]  saying who do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does care
[02:05:44.120 --> 02:05:47.640]  and right now in washington dc we have seen
[02:05:47.640 --> 02:05:51.480]  a fall of the republic get your copy of fall of the republic

[02:06:19.320 --> 02:06:23.000]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country
[02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:27.400]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[02:06:27.400 --> 02:06:31.320]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[02:06:31.320 --> 02:06:34.440]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose
[02:06:34.440 --> 02:06:38.360]  their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator
[02:06:38.360 --> 02:06:41.240]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[02:06:41.240 --> 02:06:44.360]  folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from

[02:08:25.960 --> 02:08:29.640]  uh the federal reserve a lot more set to do that tomorrow in congress max kaiser
[02:08:29.640 --> 02:08:33.160]  coming up in about 22 minutes to go over this breaking news with us we're
[02:08:33.160 --> 02:08:37.480]  almost out of time with lindsay williams uh it's clear we're going to have him
[02:08:37.480 --> 02:08:42.280]  back up on air with us next week for part two of this
[02:08:42.280 --> 02:08:47.160]  but i got lost in the mix exactly what julio's first question was i do remember
[02:08:47.160 --> 02:08:51.400]  uh his his question for max kaiser i will bring up
[02:08:51.400 --> 02:08:54.440]  but let's go ahead and talk to bobby in florida bobby you're on the air with
[02:08:54.440 --> 02:08:58.520]  lindsay williams great thank you alex
[02:08:58.520 --> 02:09:02.120]  um long time monthly member first-time caller
[02:09:02.120 --> 02:09:06.520]  um on a small recycling yard in florida
[02:09:06.520 --> 02:09:09.800]  and taking a lot of advice on the gold and silver but
[02:09:09.800 --> 02:09:15.800]  in our poor economy i've had a lot of people asking me what a backup may be
[02:09:15.800 --> 02:09:19.560]  and kind of would like to get lindsay's thought on copper
[02:09:19.560 --> 02:09:24.040]  i keep telling people copper pennies from 82 and back will probably be
[02:09:24.040 --> 02:09:27.000]  worth dollars someday yeah that's something you can get out of general
[02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:30.120]  pennies and people don't know that they're worth a lot more the old pennies
[02:09:30.120 --> 02:09:34.440]  than the new ones and you can uh cash those in but all commodities as the
[02:09:34.440 --> 02:09:38.280]  dollars devalued historically will go up lindsay
[02:09:38.280 --> 02:09:41.640]  the only reason the garland server is going to continue to escalate and
[02:09:41.640 --> 02:09:44.840]  probably never stop you think three thousand dollars an
[02:09:44.840 --> 02:09:48.680]  ounce for gold is going to be high you haven't seen anything
[02:09:48.680 --> 02:09:51.960]  after they put in the new world currency they'll continue to take it up
[02:09:51.960 --> 02:09:55.320]  the reason that's going is because they want to back it back the new world
[02:09:55.320 --> 02:09:59.320]  currency with something that is tangible and silver and by
[02:09:59.320 --> 02:10:02.280]  the way the i'm f and world bank has talked about this new global currency
[02:10:02.280 --> 02:10:06.040]  you'll still have your local currencies they'll just be denominated
[02:10:06.040 --> 02:10:09.640]  and controlled by this private central bank of the world that newsweek
[02:10:09.640 --> 02:10:12.760]  has written about and they say it'll be partially gold back so
[02:10:12.760 --> 02:10:16.120]  you're correct there as well lindsay bobby anything else
[02:10:16.120 --> 02:10:19.560]  also yeah i'd like to uh catch lindsay's idea on the
[02:10:19.560 --> 02:10:24.680]  government poised for the shutdown you think this is a uh
[02:10:24.680 --> 02:10:28.040]  something headed into just a move for their elitism
[02:10:28.040 --> 02:10:31.000]  it's another stunt to keep spending high lindsay
[02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:36.600]  yeah the elite have uh okay the gentleman just earlier in the program
[02:10:36.600 --> 02:10:40.280]  called and said you said something about the price of food all going to a
[02:10:40.280 --> 02:10:44.520]  certain place by certain date the elite has had to
[02:10:44.520 --> 02:10:49.320]  should i say they'll grow up to uh two dollars a gallon they'll come back
[02:10:49.320 --> 02:10:52.360]  three eighty they'll grow up to four point five
[02:10:52.360 --> 02:10:55.640]  they've had to go back and forth on this and they'll always keep the american
[02:10:55.640 --> 02:10:58.040]  people from waking up they throttle it one thing
[02:10:58.040 --> 02:11:01.400]  one thing about the elite they do not want the american people to wake up
[02:11:01.400 --> 02:11:06.280]  they do not want uh anarchy they they want to a slow
[02:11:06.280 --> 02:11:10.120]  frog in the pot boiling sort of a situation yeah so this is the reason
[02:11:10.120 --> 02:11:13.080]  that they do this all right bobby thank you we got to move quick now to get to
[02:11:13.080 --> 02:11:16.280]  all these callers but that's something else in october you told me that was
[02:11:16.280 --> 02:11:19.240]  really creepy because i don't really like being on their radar
[02:11:19.240 --> 02:11:23.720]  because i know they're dangerous people you said that uh your sources
[02:11:23.720 --> 02:11:29.560]  both known to yours truly said that this radio show is definitely on the radar
[02:11:29.560 --> 02:11:34.520]  definitely watching you alex uh you know two times over these past 35 years
[02:11:34.520 --> 02:11:38.200]  they've contacted me and threatened me uh they haven't done that to you yet
[02:11:38.200 --> 02:11:42.360]  fortunately and i don't think they will because well oh please you've got to
[02:11:42.360 --> 02:11:45.000]  see this the last thing i've been told i've told this
[02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:50.040]  by this Trump we have been passed away the last thing to go to america is going to be talk radio
[02:11:50.040 --> 02:11:53.640]  you people like you and others that are doing the same thing you're doing
[02:11:53.640 --> 02:11:57.400]  you are the last people they're going to shut up the reason is we don't want the
[02:11:57.400 --> 02:12:00.840]  american people to get too alarmed over what's happening they know when that
[02:12:00.840 --> 02:12:04.440]  happens that the american people will get upset at that point they'll have them
[02:12:04.440 --> 02:12:07.640]  slow on the control by the dollar that they can basically do with them what
[02:12:07.640 --> 02:12:12.520]  they want to but yes you are on their radar oh boy janice in michigan you're
[02:12:12.520 --> 02:12:16.920]  on the air go ahead thank you it's an honor to talk to both of you
[02:12:16.920 --> 02:12:22.920]  and um lindsay we even show your films are in our sunday school class for the
[02:12:22.920 --> 02:12:27.640]  prophecy prophecy class and um you know i've been telling my
[02:12:27.640 --> 02:12:30.920]  friends that when gm was uh going over there saying they're going down they're
[02:12:30.920 --> 02:12:34.120]  going down they're bankrupt they're going bankrupt and i said this is planned
[02:12:34.120 --> 02:12:38.040]  this is a takedown and this is a government takeover i called it
[02:12:38.040 --> 02:12:42.840]  and they and they made fun of me when we went into egypt um i i said when all
[02:12:42.840 --> 02:12:47.160]  this was going on in egypt they called me a mubarak supporter
[02:12:47.160 --> 02:12:49.960]  thanks a lot you know i mean these are patrick
[02:12:49.960 --> 02:12:54.760]  patriotic friends that supposedly that accused me of being a um
[02:12:54.760 --> 02:12:59.320]  and i told them this was a planned staged uh thing and that it was going to
[02:12:59.320 --> 02:13:02.040]  spread throughout the middle east because i listened to you and i know what's
[02:13:02.040 --> 02:13:05.000]  going on i can see it i know how to interpret the news
[02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:09.240]  and i'm just so thankful for you today to be saying this
[02:13:09.240 --> 02:13:12.440]  and this is all staged and i would like to um
[02:13:12.440 --> 02:13:16.360]  ask ron paul about the tea parties and have you and alex uh
[02:13:16.360 --> 02:13:20.840]  talk more about this because they've been uh taken over or the republican party
[02:13:20.840 --> 02:13:25.400]  is all it is but um and ron paul's one that started the tea parties but my
[02:13:25.400 --> 02:13:29.400]  question to you lindsay is about the stock market do you have any news on what
[02:13:29.400 --> 02:13:32.920]  would happen to the stock market as the dollar falls
[02:13:32.920 --> 02:13:37.160]  the pledge protection claim team is going to keep the stock market up as long
[02:13:37.160 --> 02:13:41.000]  as they possibly want it there and the only reason it's staying there
[02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:44.680]  is because of the plunge protection team that comes to its rescue every day
[02:13:44.680 --> 02:13:48.520]  by the way i feel honored that you would show my films until sunday's move
[02:13:48.520 --> 02:13:54.520]  class this is appreciative of me now every single one up so you me or i was

[02:14:02.360 --> 02:14:05.480]  appreciate you but we've got to hurry the next caller but i'm just doing my duty

[02:14:09.400 --> 02:14:12.040]  really quick now to get to everybody jack you're on the air
[02:14:12.040 --> 02:14:17.320]  alex uh lindsay i certainly respect your work let's go back to the bp golf
[02:14:17.320 --> 02:14:22.040]  oil disaster for a moment what's your take on the reason the tsunami did not
[02:14:22.040 --> 02:14:25.880]  occur as you richard hoagland and others predicted
[02:14:25.880 --> 02:14:30.680]  and then also what do you feel is the actual state of danger in the gulf
[02:14:30.680 --> 02:14:34.600]  region today due to the oil spill and the use of the toxic
[02:14:34.600 --> 02:14:38.520]  yeah no that's the only that's the only thing that these guys have told
[02:14:38.520 --> 02:14:42.040]  him that did not come true and at the time that was speculation by these
[02:14:42.040 --> 02:14:47.560]  elitists that a methane explosion could happen and could trigger a tsunami and i
[02:14:47.560 --> 02:14:52.200]  personally poo pooed that myself uh but lindsay quickly and i appreciate your
[02:14:52.200 --> 02:14:55.400]  call we jack i gotta let you go it was almost out of time
[02:14:55.400 --> 02:14:58.920]  uh your take on that lindsay when they get this group of deep well and the
[02:14:58.920 --> 02:15:02.040]  gulf of mexico they knew that they could not control it
[02:15:02.040 --> 02:15:04.840]  they did not know what was going to happen they knew if they knew that you
[02:15:04.840 --> 02:15:08.600]  used a nuclear device that it could possibly rupture
[02:15:08.600 --> 02:15:11.880]  that and that was talked about on the news i mean we that was just lindsay
[02:15:11.880 --> 02:15:16.200]  reporting on things in the news yes and they knew that there was a possibility
[02:15:16.200 --> 02:15:19.160]  of this and when those people were giving me some
[02:15:19.160 --> 02:15:22.600]  insiders in bp were giving me every detail of what was happening in the
[02:15:22.600 --> 02:15:26.680]  gulf they said this could possibly happen people better watch out just in case
[02:15:26.680 --> 02:15:29.480]  it does but of course it did not and i think even
[02:15:29.480 --> 02:15:32.280]  they were glad that it didn't all they would have been in big trouble
[02:15:32.280 --> 02:15:35.880]  yeah that's different from a globalist policy oh i remember what the last caller
[02:15:35.880 --> 02:15:40.440]  wanted to know he wanted to know if the tsunami could have been staged
[02:15:40.440 --> 02:15:42.920]  and then during the break you were talking to me before we forgot what the
[02:15:42.920 --> 02:15:45.400]  question was and you were saying the elitist told you
[02:15:45.400 --> 02:15:49.000]  that that no that was not a staged event that was not a bombing of the nuclear
[02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:52.760]  power plant no now the elitist did not tell me
[02:15:52.760 --> 02:15:57.000]  that they did not have anything to do with the tsunami okay i misunderstood you
[02:15:57.000 --> 02:16:01.160]  in japan but uh from what i gather from what they have said
[02:16:01.160 --> 02:16:04.760]  he was the only one to touch the subject i don't think personally that they had
[02:16:04.760 --> 02:16:08.040]  anything to do with it i think it was a natural disaster
[02:16:08.040 --> 02:16:12.520]  but they had they definitely uh have not indicated to me that they had anything
[02:16:12.520 --> 02:16:18.680]  to do with it whatsoever through uh um park and the uh scale away
[02:16:18.680 --> 02:16:21.240]  okay well i misunderstood you during the quick break thing is that other people
[02:16:21.240 --> 02:16:25.880]  talking to my ear lindsay to recap the globalists are going to try to overthrow
[02:16:25.880 --> 02:16:30.600]  all the arab uh dictatorships and and fiefdoms of these royalty
[02:16:30.600 --> 02:16:33.640]  they're going to continue uh jacking up the prices
[02:16:33.640 --> 02:16:36.680]  i'm going to definitely have the producers put you on hold right now
[02:16:36.680 --> 02:16:40.040]  and set you up for another hour sometime next week when it's good for you

[02:23:58.600 --> 02:24:08.040]  by the way curtain emote did a great job last night getting a quick report out
[02:24:08.040 --> 02:24:12.120]  ron paul to announce presidential bid next month but then this morning i was
[02:24:12.120 --> 02:24:15.640]  relistening to the 20-minute interview we did with him live yesterday and he
[02:24:15.640 --> 02:24:20.120]  actually said i'm gonna announce in the next month or maybe even sooner
[02:24:20.120 --> 02:24:23.160]  because in the next few weeks he's gonna announce whether he's gonna be in the
[02:24:23.160 --> 02:24:26.120]  presidential debate he said he tentatively is probably gonna do that
[02:24:26.120 --> 02:24:29.560]  and his son said yes i expect him to run ron paul
[02:24:29.560 --> 02:24:33.480]  he he's running and but drudge actually got it right
[02:24:33.480 --> 02:24:38.120]  his headline is ron paul to announce in weeks
[02:24:38.120 --> 02:24:41.960]  because technically he said within weeks or at least within the next month
[02:24:41.960 --> 02:24:46.840]  and the drudge report has that link up on drudgereport.com
[02:24:46.840 --> 02:24:50.600]  let me actually pull up the headline here ron paul to announce presidential run
[02:24:50.600 --> 02:24:54.120]  in weeks and then that links over to our article
[02:24:54.120 --> 02:24:58.040]  at infowars.com and we have an updated article now
[02:24:58.040 --> 02:25:02.440]  posted at the top of that story ron paul gold commodity prices
[02:25:02.440 --> 02:25:07.560]  big event signaling economic collapse and again he agreed the globalists have
[02:25:07.560 --> 02:25:11.560]  engineered this and now we're going to try to get even more power
[02:25:11.560 --> 02:25:17.080]  out of it in that process. Ted Anderson talking to you about this
[02:25:17.080 --> 02:25:19.640]  right now and i want to get back into the golden
[02:25:19.640 --> 02:25:22.680]  silver offers i could say by golden silver from mitis it's the sister
[02:25:22.680 --> 02:25:25.880]  company of genesis and that's how you started this whole thing
[02:25:25.880 --> 02:25:31.480]  but at the same time i can't even really say it supports the network or you
[02:25:31.480 --> 02:25:35.880]  or me because i happen to know but but i know you bought a mega load of silver
[02:25:35.880 --> 02:25:39.560]  and gold and then and then when it goes up you sell it at the old price
[02:25:39.560 --> 02:25:42.760]  with your tiny three percent markup i see your internal printouts
[02:25:42.760 --> 02:25:46.760]  that you send me on deals especially when i'm shopping around but
[02:25:46.760 --> 02:25:50.840]  i mean did you sell out of the silver you bought at 31 dollars an ounce
[02:25:50.840 --> 02:25:53.720]  are you crazily with it up there at 40 right now
[02:25:53.720 --> 02:25:57.720]  and most people selling a silver ounce for about 44 with the markup i mean are
[02:25:57.720 --> 02:26:01.080]  you selling three silver dollars free shipping and
[02:26:01.080 --> 02:26:04.520]  60 dollars let's put it this way i like films
[02:26:04.520 --> 02:26:08.280]  i'm not making money on them i'll tell you that but i can tell you i'll also
[02:26:08.280 --> 02:26:11.720]  tell you this i think it's so important to get those videos out in people's
[02:26:11.720 --> 02:26:15.400]  hands it just we you know i will raise those prices do i just have to i
[02:26:15.400 --> 02:26:19.640]  the creature from jekyll island was so far distorted i i couldn't help it i had
[02:26:19.640 --> 02:26:22.760]  to go uh but you were losing about 50 percent on that
[02:26:22.760 --> 02:26:26.200]  because of the silver dollars costing you you know 39 dollars
[02:26:26.200 --> 02:26:30.280]  and then your book that retails for 24 you're getting them on over about 15
[02:26:30.280 --> 02:26:35.960]  so 40 and 15 55 and you were selling that for 31 correct don't forget i have to
[02:26:35.960 --> 02:26:39.720]  put them into a priority envelope too and that's you know that's
[02:26:39.720 --> 02:26:43.000]  about six bucks you gotta pay to ship it you gotta have your people pack it
[02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:45.800]  so i mean folks when i say these are insanely good deals
[02:26:45.800 --> 02:26:49.320]  they are it's still a great deal how much is the creature in a silver dollar
[02:26:49.320 --> 02:26:53.160]  now 41 bucks try try to just buy a silver dollar
[02:26:53.160 --> 02:26:56.280]  for that i mean you're not going to get it delivered to you for 41 bucks well
[02:26:56.280 --> 02:26:59.640]  that's still a fabulous deal now now there's a grab bag of limited
[02:26:59.640 --> 02:27:03.080]  supplies of different gold and silver coins silver half dollars
[02:27:03.080 --> 02:27:05.720]  as long as you say it's the radio special you'll get the older price the
[02:27:05.720 --> 02:27:08.600]  current one is is great they got on the website but this is better
[02:27:08.600 --> 02:27:12.680]  what's a grab bag of some of the other stuff you've got well we have bags of
[02:27:12.680 --> 02:27:15.880]  dimes what we call survival bags of dimes they're sitting in the

[02:27:32.040 --> 02:27:35.800]  about a year ago it seems when we're talking about those i mean everything's
[02:27:35.800 --> 02:27:39.960]  just going out of this world elix i don't know if you know this or not but
[02:27:39.960 --> 02:27:44.840]  supplies right now are so tight uh the u.s. mint isn't making enough silver

[02:27:56.120 --> 02:27:59.960]  everything's so turned around upside down it's just driving me crazy and it

[02:36:25.240 --> 02:36:29.320]  this we couldn't be sinking even as it was listing at a 45 degree angle
[02:36:29.320 --> 02:36:31.720]  people on 9 11 said i'm going back to my office

[02:36:38.600 --> 02:36:43.400]  we don't have to go over this cliff and uh
[02:36:43.400 --> 02:36:46.680]  it shows that the globalist are really moving into their end game
[02:36:46.680 --> 02:36:50.520]  but we've been prepared for this warning people being laughed at for decades
[02:36:50.520 --> 02:36:54.360]  now people aren't laughing they're really listening everywhere i go
[02:36:54.360 --> 02:36:58.040]  big wigs mainline business people that laughed at me years ago run up and say

[02:37:10.200 --> 02:37:13.080]  is really being exposed they're trying to make us fight with each other
[02:37:13.080 --> 02:37:16.440]  via the left right paradigm but more and more it's not working
[02:37:16.440 --> 02:37:19.800]  and now is the time to scream bloody murder and get this information out like
[02:37:19.800 --> 02:37:23.560]  ever before because the quickening is here the acceleration the
[02:37:23.560 --> 02:37:27.000]  amplification is here and people i've never been more ready to
[02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:29.720]  hear the truth so it's on we're in the new world
[02:37:29.720 --> 02:37:33.080]  order toe-to-toe with the globalist we got a fight and chance
[02:37:33.080 --> 02:37:36.120]  they just want to arrogantly throw all this in our face
[02:37:36.120 --> 02:37:39.400]  hide it in plain view and think that we'll just go along with it we got to
[02:37:39.400 --> 02:37:43.240]  break the trance now max keiser joins us he's the
[02:37:43.240 --> 02:37:46.680]  inventor of the hollywood stock exchange virtual trading system used in

[02:38:03.640 --> 02:38:07.240]  his move for investigations uh the this
[02:38:07.240 --> 02:38:11.560]  testimony he's going to be uh leading tomorrow in the house what's happening
[02:38:11.560 --> 02:38:16.200]  with silver uh it's on as max said to me during the break max keiser
[02:38:16.200 --> 02:38:20.040]  break down what you see happening well we've totally got him
[02:38:20.040 --> 02:38:24.360]  we've totally got him alex um and this uh bernie vaughn
[02:38:24.360 --> 02:38:31.880]  not house a case is gold is a jp morgan is totally desperate uh their stock
[02:38:31.880 --> 02:38:37.000]  price now is directly under assault by the rising price of silver
[02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:41.000]  and uh tomorrow of course is the 7th of april
[02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:45.400]  uh four seven which is the atomic number of silver
[02:38:45.400 --> 02:38:48.920]  and this is the formal recognition of the silver
[02:38:48.920 --> 02:38:55.000]  liberation army the s l a and that is the one of the best ideas for google
[02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:58.840]  bomb i ever heard the silver liberation army
[02:38:58.840 --> 02:39:02.440]  is going to take all the silver off the market necessary
[02:39:02.440 --> 02:39:07.160]  to completely bankrupt the banksters this this bernie vaughn not house case
[02:39:07.160 --> 02:39:11.160]  you know jpm is is in the nut house they were going to put jp morgan in the
[02:39:11.160 --> 02:39:15.640]  nut house there's absolutely outrageous that they would go after this guy by
[02:39:15.640 --> 02:39:19.080]  the way it's pronounced note house he corrected me but we i guess you can call
[02:39:19.080 --> 02:39:22.600]  it nut house if you want but you know the the the issue here is even the
[02:39:22.600 --> 02:39:27.560]  wall street journal even ap said this makes regular barter illegal
[02:39:27.560 --> 02:39:30.120]  they didn't even have a law they just had a
[02:39:30.120 --> 02:39:36.520]  servile jury who probably have have iqs below room temperature
[02:39:36.520 --> 02:39:39.800]  well the the seven million in silver that they're trying to
[02:39:39.800 --> 02:39:44.840]  uh grab from citizens is is directly going to be used to offset jp morgan
[02:39:44.840 --> 02:39:47.560]  the short silver position that's how desperate they are
[02:39:47.560 --> 02:39:50.600]  they they're scrambling for silver in the open market they can't get it
[02:39:50.600 --> 02:39:54.440]  you've got guys in canada uh in all over the united states who are taking
[02:39:54.440 --> 02:39:57.320]  physical off the market so you're saying you believe what you launched here
[02:39:57.320 --> 02:39:59.640]  three four months ago when others picked up on
[02:39:59.640 --> 02:40:03.800]  tens of thousands of video sites you're saying that the crash jp morgan by
[02:40:03.800 --> 02:40:07.800]  silver has now gone into terminal velocity uh it's it's now gone into
[02:40:07.800 --> 02:40:11.560]  point no return uh and and that they are scrambling
[02:40:11.560 --> 02:40:16.040]  yes because the jp morgan has put up their own stock as collateral against
[02:40:16.040 --> 02:40:20.200]  these shorts and that means that when the price gets above 47 as you see it's
[02:40:20.200 --> 02:40:24.920]  now almost 40 once it gets over 47 jp morgan's going to fall like a house of
[02:40:24.920 --> 02:40:28.120]  cart this is it going to be an unbelievable spectacle to watch this
[02:40:28.120 --> 02:40:32.120]  160 million dollar colossus this financial terrorist the two terrorists get
[02:40:32.120 --> 02:40:36.760]  totally defamated right before our eyes now we get calls saying well they'll
[02:40:36.760 --> 02:40:40.280]  just print money and paper and throw it at it but
[02:40:40.280 --> 02:40:44.520]  everybody's gross rock ball everybody's rock ball thing no more
[02:40:44.520 --> 02:40:47.320]  he's going to put a lie in the sand no more paper money
[02:40:47.320 --> 02:40:51.000]  you've got utah going to golden a silver standard you got five states
[02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:54.920]  are going through precious metal standard rock ball standing and saying no more
[02:40:54.920 --> 02:40:59.000]  jp morgan's being carried on a structure good done all right i want to give you
[02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:01.080]  the floor i want to give you the floor to go with this i'm not
[02:41:01.080 --> 02:41:05.400]  disagreeing with you explain to people though that only a fraction
[02:41:05.400 --> 02:41:08.920]  of the silver needs to be physically held and then that
[02:41:08.920 --> 02:41:13.080]  calls their bluff on their paper manipulation explain
[02:41:13.080 --> 02:41:16.360]  the technicals of that and then you got the floor well for every ounce that
[02:41:16.360 --> 02:41:20.280]  somebody buys a silver jp morgan sells 20 to 50 ounces of silver that don't
[02:41:20.280 --> 02:41:23.160]  exist it's called naked short selling that's the
[02:41:23.160 --> 02:41:26.120]  simple that's the bottom line they sell silver that doesn't exist it's naked
[02:41:26.120 --> 02:41:29.880]  short selling they've sold more than by some estimates three billion ounces
[02:41:29.880 --> 02:41:33.400]  short but more than a billion certainly and that's the entire silver stock
[02:41:33.400 --> 02:41:36.440]  above ground they've sold short more stock than exist above ground
[02:41:36.440 --> 02:41:38.920]  and they're on the floor every day manipulating the price every time
[02:41:38.920 --> 02:41:42.280]  selling shows up to buy one ounce of silver jp morgan tries to sell
[02:41:42.280 --> 02:41:46.200]  10 as a naked short sale sale silver that they don't
[02:41:46.200 --> 02:41:49.560]  own but at the end of the month the books have to be squared
[02:41:49.560 --> 02:41:52.680]  the co-max has to physically deliver just a few days ago
[02:41:52.680 --> 02:41:56.920]  the co-max came once again within a hair breath of collapsing due to physical
[02:41:56.920 --> 02:41:59.480]  delivery every month gets closer and closer
[02:41:59.480 --> 02:42:03.800]  and now with what's happening with the silver liberation army
[02:42:03.800 --> 02:42:06.520]  which is being launched globally around the world
[02:42:06.520 --> 02:42:10.040]  uh we're going to take what's remaining of that silver off the out of the
[02:42:10.040 --> 02:42:13.240]  physical stock off the physical market and we're going to put you know jp
[02:42:13.240 --> 02:42:16.680]  market six feet under they're the terrorists they're the ones financing
[02:42:16.680 --> 02:42:20.600]  khaddafi they're the ones financing al-qaeda they're the ones financing
[02:42:20.600 --> 02:42:24.360]  the the financial terrorist on wall by the way that did come out
[02:42:24.360 --> 02:42:28.120]  that did come out when uh murnaki for several years didn't want to release
[02:42:28.120 --> 02:42:31.720]  where the trillions in mail out went a lot of it but most of it went to europe
[02:42:31.720 --> 02:42:34.840]  and private corporation but some of it did go to khaddafi
[02:42:34.840 --> 02:42:39.000]  absolutely through the back end mechanism the machinations and and and the
[02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:42.840]  pipeline financial pipelines conducted primarily by morgan and
[02:42:42.840 --> 02:42:47.800]  engolmes act so now it's coming to the surface but this silver liberation
[02:42:47.800 --> 02:42:53.640]  army this global force of physical buyers is striking a
[02:42:53.640 --> 02:42:57.240]  blow for freedom and they are we're going to have the joy of
[02:42:57.240 --> 02:43:01.640]  watching for our own spectacle the collapse of this colossal
[02:43:01.640 --> 02:43:05.800]  terrorist jp morgan and the price is now run away the price of silver is
[02:43:05.800 --> 02:43:10.120]  running away like wild dogs can't stop it anymore
[02:43:10.120 --> 02:43:12.840]  people are taking it off the market the more they take off the market
[02:43:12.840 --> 02:43:16.440]  the higher it's going to go and this is a fantastic
[02:43:16.440 --> 02:43:21.080]  wealth transfer they stole our wealth now we're taking it back
[02:43:21.080 --> 02:43:26.360]  and that's uh giving us the wherewithal to rebuild this entire economy and
[02:43:26.360 --> 02:43:30.440]  rebuild this entire political system with smart people like ron paul
[02:43:30.440 --> 02:43:36.760]  in in charge who can bring back all the freedoms that people had before these
[02:43:36.760 --> 02:43:41.720]  banks or terrorists took them away now how do you expect morgan to try to stop
[02:43:41.720 --> 02:43:44.280]  this from happening i mean even mainstream news
[02:43:44.280 --> 02:43:47.240]  is now saying the comics could default you're correct
[02:43:47.240 --> 02:43:51.880]  on that but but uh one of the exact numbers that'll happen at forty seven
[02:43:51.880 --> 02:43:55.080]  uh when do you expect that to happen or do you think they could successfully
[02:43:55.080 --> 02:43:58.280]  drive it back down how how is the empire going to strike back
[02:43:58.280 --> 02:44:02.120]  well the what'll what'll have to go they have to choose
[02:44:02.120 --> 02:44:07.000]  either jp morgan lives or they're going to have to
[02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:10.760]  completely sacrifice the dollar and the federal reserve bank
[02:44:10.760 --> 02:44:14.680]  and it's all going to go down the toilet anyway it's all worthless
[02:44:14.680 --> 02:44:21.080]  and if they go to the fed like they did in october of 2008 if they go to the
[02:44:21.080 --> 02:44:25.480]  treasury and they're getting a wall of paper but this only
[02:44:25.480 --> 02:44:29.080]  increases the inflation and the price of the silver
[02:44:29.080 --> 02:44:32.840]  which is causing damage on their balance sheet because they are short
[02:44:32.840 --> 02:44:36.280]  the silver every time the silver goes up a buck they
[02:44:36.280 --> 02:44:40.680]  that they've got millions and millions more liabilities on their balance sheet
[02:44:40.680 --> 02:44:45.000]  they never anticipated that campaign that was launched on your show on
[02:44:45.000 --> 02:44:49.400]  november 11th silver was 26 and a half they never anticipated well i don't
[02:44:49.400 --> 02:44:53.880]  want i don't want credit for devastating moves we'll just give it all to you max
[02:44:53.880 --> 02:44:59.320]  well they lost on your show and it caught fire and they never anticipated
[02:44:59.320 --> 02:45:02.040]  that in other words they've got analysts who try to put pencil to paper and
[02:45:02.040 --> 02:45:05.640]  figure out the risk of owning all of them now they've got google predictive
[02:45:05.640 --> 02:45:11.960]  futuristic modeling uh systems and and but but they can't gauge the
[02:45:11.960 --> 02:45:16.520]  organic explosive info war attack paradigm that's right that was not
[02:45:16.520 --> 02:45:20.920]  calculated on their risk analysis and they've been playing catch up ever since
[02:45:20.920 --> 02:45:24.360]  and it just gets worse and worse every single day and it is on
[02:45:24.360 --> 02:45:29.160]  a note house uh it's practical it to me is a clear indication that we've
[02:45:29.160 --> 02:45:32.600]  totally won this this war because they're going after
[02:45:32.600 --> 02:45:36.600]  num nuts nobody with a silver liberty coin to try to attack this guy to get
[02:45:36.600 --> 02:45:39.800]  seven immediately seven million dollars the silver to cover their
[02:45:39.800 --> 02:45:43.880]  you know father really doing it to scare they're doing it to scare
[02:45:43.880 --> 02:45:47.960]  people that are holding silver and gold and to teach juries that silver and
[02:45:47.960 --> 02:45:51.160]  gold is illegal even when it's not yeah i'm really scared

[02:49:11.960 --> 02:49:16.840]  for this 2012 election i really i think he he's got the momentum
[02:49:16.840 --> 02:49:22.280]  he's got the right message it's his time and he's got he's going after these
[02:49:22.280 --> 02:49:26.200]  guys and he's i'm a big supporter i you know the guy
[02:49:26.200 --> 02:49:29.800]  has got it this is his year i really believe it i think obama's
[02:49:29.800 --> 02:49:34.280]  got nothing he was as you pointed out in the obama deception
[02:49:34.280 --> 02:49:40.120]  he's just an empty suit he's got nothing and the inflation skyrocketing people
[02:49:40.120 --> 02:49:44.520]  people are buying you know 12 bucks for a bag of tomatoes i mean it's
[02:49:44.520 --> 02:49:48.280]  ridiculous and they know exactly what the problem is these banksters must fit
[02:49:48.280 --> 02:49:51.480]  and that's ron paul that's where he's going after he's going after the
[02:49:51.480 --> 02:49:54.760]  problem so this is what's happening and i think he's going to do really really
[02:49:54.760 --> 02:49:59.320]  well absolutely and you know that the system is
[02:49:59.320 --> 02:50:04.120]  horrified of ron paul but they can't kill an idea ideas are bulletproof
[02:50:04.120 --> 02:50:07.400]  well supposedly tomorrow he's doing an address in front of congress i think he
[02:50:07.400 --> 02:50:10.920]  talked about it and he's going to start talking more and more about precious
[02:50:10.920 --> 02:50:15.400]  metals the gold and silver as their role in a sound economy
[02:50:15.400 --> 02:50:19.080]  and and and rebuilding the american economy and this of course if they come
[02:50:19.080 --> 02:50:23.000]  back and they have to go back to a gold standard because the debts are so high
[02:50:23.000 --> 02:50:26.600]  because they've got hundreds of trillion dollars in debt the way to go back to a
[02:50:26.600 --> 02:50:31.000]  breton wood style gold back currency you'd have to mark the price of gold up
[02:50:31.000 --> 02:50:34.760]  to a minimum of seven thousand dollars an ounce a minimum of seven
[02:50:34.760 --> 02:50:38.920]  stay there let's talk about it yeah no ron paul put the gloves off yesterday

[02:54:44.280 --> 02:54:49.000]  the market i mean slowly but surely the globalist
[02:54:49.000 --> 02:54:52.680]  time is running out you're more comments on ron paul and when you really
[02:54:52.680 --> 02:54:55.960]  think they're going to default on the comics
[02:54:55.960 --> 02:55:00.520]  well yeah as you point out you know the game for the silver market for years
[02:55:00.520 --> 02:55:03.720]  because silver doesn't pay any interest this is how the whole thing got started
[02:55:03.720 --> 02:55:07.560]  they would short silver and buy back cheaper
[02:55:07.560 --> 02:55:11.240]  and then the federal government would allow them to do so by leasing them out
[02:55:11.240 --> 02:55:14.520]  precious metals and this is the way the investment banks
[02:55:14.520 --> 02:55:18.120]  and the broker dealers could make up maybe one or two percent a year
[02:55:18.120 --> 02:55:21.720]  on silver and gold which don't pay any interest but what's happened over the
[02:55:21.720 --> 02:55:24.920]  past 10 or 15 years is that the amount that they've sold short has
[02:55:24.920 --> 02:55:28.520]  mushroomed and ballooned and with interest rate that zero percent
[02:55:28.520 --> 02:55:31.800]  their ability to borrow money from the fed and other sources
[02:55:31.800 --> 02:55:35.640]  that zero percent means that they can expand that silver short position to
[02:55:35.640 --> 02:55:39.240]  where it is astronomically large and this is where the unexpected thing
[02:55:39.240 --> 02:55:42.600]  happens at the black swan event where people said you know what we're going
[02:55:42.600 --> 02:55:46.280]  to take physical delivery thus forcing you to buy that silver in the open
[02:55:46.280 --> 02:55:50.120]  market and once that ball got rolling it started to
[02:55:50.120 --> 02:55:52.840]  and get faster and faster down the mountain of price
[02:55:52.840 --> 02:55:56.600]  appreciation and right now with silver just under 40 bucks a share
[02:55:56.600 --> 02:56:01.560]  you've got this outrageous kleptomaniac jp market and friends trying to go
[02:56:01.560 --> 02:56:04.600]  after four uh bernie von note house and a seven
[02:56:04.600 --> 02:56:07.640]  million dollars of silver which is clearly just a way to get some physical
[02:56:07.640 --> 02:56:10.920]  in-house to offset their huge short position but it's such a piddling
[02:56:10.920 --> 02:56:14.680]  sum and their problem is so huge that it's laughable and it's only going to
[02:56:14.680 --> 02:56:17.320]  inspire people like myself and everyone around the world
[02:56:17.320 --> 02:56:21.400]  that she's keep buying physical silver to make the situation worse and worse
[02:56:21.400 --> 02:56:24.120]  and worse and the more you do the higher the price is going to go
[02:56:24.120 --> 02:56:28.600]  once it gets past the old 1980 hunts brother's 50 dollar price
[02:56:28.600 --> 02:56:32.440]  level that there's no resistance you know this is a technical term there's no
[02:56:32.440 --> 02:56:35.400]  sellers there's nobody's selling it anymore because no one's ever owned it
[02:56:35.400 --> 02:56:38.600]  that high so you then you see a gap go from 50
[02:56:38.600 --> 02:56:42.520]  you can see a gap right do a straight shot up to 75
[02:56:42.520 --> 02:56:46.520]  and that's what the traders the professional traders are banking on now
[02:56:46.520 --> 02:56:50.440]  they get it past that jp morgan price jp morgan throws in the towel
[02:56:50.440 --> 02:56:54.680]  and starts to buy in the open market just like that movie trading places they
[02:56:54.680 --> 02:56:59.240]  remember it with uh you know um the uh from from 20 years
[02:56:59.240 --> 02:57:02.600]  ago there was that huge swing in the marketplace jp morgan
[02:57:02.600 --> 02:57:05.880]  are the losers they have to go into the market and buy it in the open market
[02:57:05.880 --> 02:57:09.160]  which is only going to catapult the price into the triple figures
[02:57:09.160 --> 02:57:12.840]  it's it's almost comical because it's going to be such a spectacular fireworks
[02:57:12.840 --> 02:57:16.280]  because it's been cheap for 20 years artificially cheap so the genie's out of
[02:57:16.280 --> 02:57:20.120]  the bottle meanwhile if you own it you're getting wealthier
[02:57:20.120 --> 02:57:24.120]  and the banks are getting poorer that's the beautiful thing they stole our wealth
[02:57:24.120 --> 02:57:29.160]  now we're taking it back through the mechanism of silver
[02:57:29.160 --> 02:57:33.000]  well you're absolutely right and i am seeing the trolls
[02:57:33.000 --> 02:57:37.480]  and the george soros people go all out against uh ron paul right now with
[02:57:37.480 --> 02:57:43.080]  their pentagon robot uh fake posts so people better get ready and pray for
