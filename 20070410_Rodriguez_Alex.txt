[00:00:05.635 --> 00:00:21.721]  We are carrying a five-camera shoot production of the presentation that William Rodriguez gave last June in Los Angeles, and it brought so many people to tears.
[00:00:21.721 --> 00:00:29.284]  We all pretty much unanimously agree, I know Charlie Sheen and myself, that it was the most powerful presentation that was given.
[00:00:29.284 --> 00:00:31.585]  Of course, I got second place, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:31.585 --> 00:00:32.565]  It doesn't really matter.
[00:00:33.594 --> 00:00:39.596]  But the point is that it's extremely powerful, and we got a couple hundred copies of these, and those are going fast.
[00:00:39.596 --> 00:00:41.276]  And William produced this himself.
[00:00:41.276 --> 00:00:42.237]  It's very well done.
[00:00:42.237 --> 00:00:45.458]  And our two cameras, and he had three cameras there.
[00:00:45.458 --> 00:00:56.461]  He did a great job, and he goes through 9-11, he goes through the tragedy, he goes through how he saved the people, and then how the cover-up's taking place, and how they try to use him.
[00:00:56.461 --> 00:00:59.202]  It's a very poignant, important, well-done piece.
[00:00:59.202 --> 00:00:59.742]  We carry it.
[00:00:59.742 --> 00:01:00.923]  $15 at InfoWars.com.
[00:01:03.104 --> 00:01:08.687]  It's called What Really Happened on 9-11 by William Rodriguez.
[00:01:08.687 --> 00:01:14.991]  Available at Infowars.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:01:14.991 --> 00:01:20.835]  And while you're on the site or calling the toll-free number, be sure and get America, Freedom to Fascism by Aaron Russo.
[00:01:20.835 --> 00:01:25.858]  Be sure and get my new film Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror, and peruse all the discounts and specials.
[00:01:26.278 --> 00:01:27.820]  Okay, going to William Rodriguez now.
[00:01:41.678 --> 00:01:56.309]  This morning, I talked to him, and he'd just gotten back from his trip from New York to Michigan, and he'd been there defending Kevin Barrett, the professor who they've been calling for him to be fired, for him not to be able to give speeches, for him to have his... I mean, it's horrible.
[00:01:56.309 --> 00:01:57.370]  You know what they do.
[00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.111]  I need to be put in a camp.
[00:01:59.111 --> 00:02:01.713]  Charlie Sheen needs to lose his job.
[00:02:01.713 --> 00:02:03.454]  Mark Cuban needs to go to prison.
[00:02:03.454 --> 00:02:05.896]  I need to die.
[00:02:05.896 --> 00:02:09.979]  Rosie needs to be hung by the neck until she dies.
[00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.120]  All of this is going on.
[00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.502]  And we're sick of it.
[00:02:14.502 --> 00:02:15.943]  We're tired of it.
[00:02:15.943 --> 00:02:19.866]  And they love to use the first responders, the heroes like Willie Rodriguez.
[00:02:19.866 --> 00:02:30.614]  They love to do all of this and they love to sit up there and use them and use their heroism to appropriate it under their own agendas.
[00:02:30.614 --> 00:02:31.975]  And we're sick of it.
[00:02:31.975 --> 00:02:34.516]  The majority of the families believe it's an inside job.
[00:02:34.516 --> 00:02:38.219]  Bill Doyle, the head of the biggest victim group, has told you that on air.
[00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:39.340]  Many others have come on air.
[00:02:40.535 --> 00:02:45.777]  The majority of police and firemen, the vast majority I talked to in New York, know there's a cover-up.
[00:02:45.777 --> 00:02:55.080]  Okay, so the New World Order is sitting on top of a keg of dynamite here, a keg of TNT, and let me tell you, there's fuses all over the place, and those fuses are already lit, folks.
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:00.462]  The question is, will that keg of TNT go off and blow us to bits, or are we going to get in a position where this doesn't hurt us?
[00:03:01.392 --> 00:03:03.513]  And now is the time to act.
[00:03:03.513 --> 00:03:04.954]  So William Rodriguez joins us.
[00:03:04.954 --> 00:03:08.996]  He also spoke to some of the family of one of the people on Flight 77.
[00:03:08.996 --> 00:03:13.018]  And he did a really professional job, but I didn't talk to him after this morning.
[00:03:13.018 --> 00:03:23.703]  He sent me this video clip he put together of a slideshow, so it made more sense to just cut out the questions that were asked and, you know, insert them ourselves to make it have more brevity.
[00:03:23.703 --> 00:03:27.605]  But I was unable to get that in time, so William's going to do it.
[00:03:27.605 --> 00:03:29.746]  William Rodriguez, thank you for joining us.
[00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:31.160]  Thank you, thank you.
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:39.205]  It's a pleasure, like always, to be on your show, and a lot of things are happening here in the Tri-State area as well.
[00:03:39.205 --> 00:03:42.187]  The presentation this weekend was amazing.
[00:03:42.187 --> 00:03:45.529]  We have close to 300 people, full venue.
[00:03:45.529 --> 00:03:46.429]  Tell folks about that.
[00:03:46.429 --> 00:03:48.691]  Where you went, why you went, what happened.
[00:03:48.691 --> 00:03:57.036]  And our board, of course, the site of Michigan State University, and what we were trying to do was, I heard
[00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.700]  I think?
[00:04:19.591 --> 00:04:22.132]  from his university while he was away.
[00:04:22.132 --> 00:04:23.593]  He wasn't even at the university.
[00:04:23.593 --> 00:04:28.795]  He was doing a speech, a conference somewhere in another state.
[00:04:28.795 --> 00:04:34.517]  And they just kind of put this together because they knew he wasn't going to be there to debate this guy.
[00:04:34.517 --> 00:04:41.159]  And what basically this guy is doing is he's going on a speaking tour, you know, promoting a book.
[00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:47.602]  And he's a survivor from the 50-something floor and basically attacked Mr. Barrett directly.
[00:04:48.654 --> 00:04:54.819]  And what we have here was an attempt by this organization to discredit these men.
[00:04:54.819 --> 00:05:05.888]  But again, you know, you're going to have, of course, the victims that do not agree with what we're doing, but the majority agree with what we are trying to do to look for the search for the truth.
[00:05:05.888 --> 00:05:11.112]  And so I got so angry that I said, well, how come they never call me this group?
[00:05:11.112 --> 00:05:13.714]  And of course, because they wanted to attack Mr. Barrett.
[00:05:13.714 --> 00:05:17.437]  So I said, no, I'm going to take it upon myself to go over there and try to do something.
[00:05:18.178 --> 00:05:28.462]  And little do we know is that so many people were so upset that they started to call for the possibility of an argumentation and debate forum.
[00:05:28.462 --> 00:05:35.725]  And they brought Mr. Kevin from UL Laboratory and Kevin Ryan.
[00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:49.487]  And they put together this debate and invited the youth of the Republican Party, they invited all the groups that supposedly attack us constantly, and they didn't show up.
[00:05:49.487 --> 00:05:58.792]  We had an empty seat, and what happened was that Mr. Barrett and Mr. Kevin Ryan had to do the debate themselves.
[00:05:58.792 --> 00:06:03.375]  And it was funny because just to see Mr. Kevin Ryan playing the devil's advocate,
[00:06:04.277 --> 00:06:04.837]  I think so.
[00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:35.773]  Now tell us specifically about who this family is, who this woman and man are that you then talked to and who they had that was family on Flight 77.
[00:06:52.836 --> 00:06:55.257]  Well, this is John and Bev Titus.
[00:06:55.257 --> 00:06:58.038]  They lost their daughter.
[00:06:58.038 --> 00:07:00.740]  Her daughter was Alicia Titus.
[00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:09.924]  And if you play the clip, you could hear the first question that I asked is, can you please tell us, what do you think of William Rodriguez's presentation?
[00:07:09.924 --> 00:07:11.764]  And this is what they said.
[00:07:11.764 --> 00:07:18.727]  Okay, network, go ahead and play that and then leave William's audio up, because he's going to speak and ask the question so it's more condensed, so it makes sense.
[00:07:18.727 --> 00:07:20.488]  Yeah, leave it running.
[00:07:20.488 --> 00:07:21.709]  Yeah, just leave it running.
[00:07:21.709 --> 00:07:22.029]  Here it is.
[00:07:22.737 --> 00:07:37.300]  I thought he did an incredible job of telling the facts, giving us some insight from the inside of the towers, portraying it in such a strong and powerful emotional way.
[00:07:38.621 --> 00:07:44.445]  That, and with the evidence to back it up, that it was, it was beyond credible.
[00:07:44.445 --> 00:07:46.627]  It was, it was incredible.
[00:07:46.627 --> 00:07:53.371]  And it was, you know, it's something that we, we've been looking for the answers for a long time.
[00:07:53.371 --> 00:08:00.577]  And to hear people that were there that knew what was going on helps us to, in some of the, in our grieving.
[00:08:01.983 --> 00:08:03.704]  Who do you lose on 9-11?
[00:08:03.704 --> 00:08:08.368]  Alicia was killed on the second plane that hit the South Tower.
[00:08:08.368 --> 00:08:15.454]  So we've been dealing with our own grief and we felt Mr. Rodriguez's pain as well.
[00:08:15.454 --> 00:08:21.159]  And we know that he's dealing with some of the same issues that we are.
[00:08:21.159 --> 00:08:23.701]  Yeah, let me ask you the question everybody have in their minds.
[00:08:23.701 --> 00:08:28.685]  As an affected family member of 9-11, do you support us and Mr. Rodriguez's search for the truth?
[00:08:29.204 --> 00:08:34.367]  On what we're trying to bring out for the families.
[00:08:34.367 --> 00:08:37.529]  Absolutely.
[00:08:37.529 --> 00:08:45.874]  That'll be our lifelong quest is to try to find the truth of September 11th and what's really the real story behind it.
[00:08:45.874 --> 00:08:53.239]  Because we know that what we've been given is only a glimpse of it and distortions of it.
[00:08:55.817 --> 00:08:59.858]  We deserve, my daughter deserves better than that.
[00:08:59.858 --> 00:09:01.339]  Where was your daughter on 9-11?
[00:09:01.339 --> 00:09:07.161]  She was a flight attendant on flight 175.
[00:09:07.161 --> 00:09:18.485]  I feel five years later that it's still very difficult for me to wrap my mind around that Alicia was killed and that there are still no answers.
[00:09:19.824 --> 00:09:35.069]  To so many questions that we have and we've not been given the truth and that we're going to continue to search and support people that are out there asking the same kinds of questions and demanding the truth.
[00:09:35.069 --> 00:09:39.570]  For us it's a loss that will never end.
[00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:45.232]  Each day we feel the pain and the sadness from a loss of our daughter who is
[00:09:46.072 --> 00:10:06.524]  Very important in our lives and it's it doesn't you know we have moments where we can feel joy but the pain is always there it follows you around the sadness in our family we feel it whenever we have family get-togethers and family is very very important to us.
[00:10:06.524 --> 00:10:09.866]  We ask them how they feel five years after and this is what they answer.
[00:10:13.797 --> 00:10:16.679]  She was like a best friend as well as a daughter.
[00:10:16.679 --> 00:10:23.664]  And I know her and Bev were... She used to call her almost every day and tell her about what was going on in her life.
[00:10:23.664 --> 00:10:30.490]  I mean, it was... Even though she traveled all over the world, she was very, very connected with us.
[00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:35.974]  And still is, but... The loss is great.
[00:10:35.974 --> 00:10:38.876]  And the last words after the interview was these ones.
[00:10:42.974 --> 00:10:51.543]  We want to thank Mr. Rodriguez for all he's doing to bring out the truth because it's very important to us.
[00:10:51.543 --> 00:10:52.664]  Wow, that is amazing.
[00:10:52.664 --> 00:11:03.955]  In fact, I think we might just at the end of the show, in the last five minutes, re-air that with just you at the first, William, you know, asking the three or four questions up front and then just playing it.
[00:11:04.591 --> 00:11:05.831]  I will place it on my website in a day or two.
[00:11:05.831 --> 00:11:07.412]  The interview is really long.
[00:11:07.412 --> 00:11:09.853]  We're just going to put the one that you just played.
[00:11:32.055 --> 00:11:34.859]  It's 911keymaster.com or William911.com
[00:11:36.714 --> 00:11:40.015]  That's easier to remember, William911.com.
[00:11:40.015 --> 00:11:47.437]  William911.com, and of course we've got links right now up on InfoWars.com to your main site there.
[00:11:47.437 --> 00:11:50.718]  Basically what we're going to do, we're going to re-edit everything.
[00:11:50.718 --> 00:12:00.721]  Actually, I did a long interview because I'm going to many, many of the families and recording them on their views and also to support me on some of the things.
[00:12:00.721 --> 00:12:01.781]  I'm putting my gloves on.
[00:12:01.781 --> 00:12:04.482]  I'm fighting a lot of the people out there that are attacking us.
[00:12:05.535 --> 00:12:16.141]  I'm putting together the support from the families, and what you will see is one of the future releases of another video that we are putting together that, of course, we're going to make available to you.
[00:12:16.141 --> 00:12:17.662]  You know, I love the way you put that, though.
[00:12:17.662 --> 00:12:26.748]  You say, I'm putting the gloves on, meaning you're getting in the ring with them, but I guess in Texas we say we're taking the gloves off, but bottom line, William Rodriguez is taking the gloves off.
[00:12:26.748 --> 00:12:27.008]  Correct.
[00:12:27.703 --> 00:12:39.107]  No, I'm fighting back, and I'm fighting with all the strength that I can to expose these people, people that supported us in the beginning as well, and then attackers.
[00:12:39.107 --> 00:12:44.649]  I'm just going and just protecting, protecting what we're trying to do here.
[00:12:44.649 --> 00:12:56.533]  And what we have here also is a full... I want to talk about so many things, but they're confidential, and they're not... Still, we cannot put it out there, but you know what I'm talking about, Alex.
[00:12:57.846 --> 00:13:01.348]  A lot of developments are happening as we speak right now.
[00:13:01.348 --> 00:13:08.692]  This week is going to be amazing and hopefully we will have wonderful news for the movement this week.
[00:13:08.692 --> 00:13:14.155]  So it looks like that's on for this week then?
[00:13:14.155 --> 00:13:15.736]  Hopefully, yes.
[00:13:15.736 --> 00:13:16.637]  If not, next week?
[00:13:17.646 --> 00:13:26.272]  Well, you know, it's some mixed communications of what we're doing, but hopefully something will happen this week.
[00:13:26.272 --> 00:13:32.897]  Well, if I know this individual, we're going to see something sooner rather than later, because they just can't, you know, I mean, they're like us, they want to charge in.
[00:13:32.897 --> 00:13:35.139]  Yes, yes, correct, correct.
[00:13:35.139 --> 00:13:39.322]  But the other thing is, like I said, I've seen a lot of activism.
[00:13:39.867 --> 00:13:40.467]  I don't know.
[00:14:04.256 --> 00:14:04.396]  Yes.
[00:14:23.303 --> 00:14:28.086]  I mean, obviously, this is why you're doing the interviews with victims, but you didn't even know they'd be there.
[00:14:28.086 --> 00:14:46.097]  But that is really a good idea, to counter these neocons, is to make a whole film just with victims like yourself, and also heroes, saying, we know it's an inside job, we know it's an inside job, we know it's an inside job, but then I guess the Fox News and others will still just ignore that, but at least we can get it out to the people going, look,
[00:14:46.577 --> 00:14:49.097]  You know, the victims don't believe the official story.
[00:14:49.097 --> 00:14:51.618]  They know it's an inside job, many of them.
[00:14:51.618 --> 00:14:54.358]  Because, I mean, we talked about this last time you were on.
[00:14:54.358 --> 00:15:02.360]  It makes me sick at my stomach watching the very killers use those they killed and their families to make themselves look like heroes.
[00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:05.740]  But it's got to feel good to you now to see people fighting back like this family.
[00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:11.861]  And again, it's Joan, Titus, and what's the husband's name?
[00:15:11.861 --> 00:15:14.602]  The wife is Beverly, Bev.
[00:15:14.602 --> 00:15:15.302]  Okay, Beverly.
[00:15:16.906 --> 00:15:18.368]  Go ahead and dig it out, it's okay.
[00:15:18.368 --> 00:15:19.809]  John and Bev.
[00:15:19.809 --> 00:15:21.010]  John and Bev, okay.
[00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:23.993]  John and Bev Titus.
[00:15:23.993 --> 00:15:30.739]  And their daughter was... By 177, that was the flight that hit the South Tower.
[00:15:30.739 --> 00:15:32.421]  Alicia Titus, right?
[00:15:32.421 --> 00:15:32.801]  Correct.
[00:15:32.801 --> 00:15:36.885]  Okay, I've got it all written down in the other room, but of course I don't have my notes in front of me, sorry.
[00:15:36.885 --> 00:15:39.388]  But Alicia Titus, did you get their phone number, William?
[00:15:39.388 --> 00:15:40.449]  Because I'd love to get them on.
[00:15:41.383 --> 00:15:46.365]  I have all the information, and not only that, we actually are going to put something big.
[00:15:46.365 --> 00:15:51.368]  We're talking about 400 families, so we are putting it together, yes.
[00:15:51.368 --> 00:16:05.655]  And that's some of the big news that we are putting on the... Well, we cannot talk too much about it, because, you know, the people on the powers that be will try to preempt whatever we are trying to do.
[00:16:06.345 --> 00:16:19.096]  That's why you have, uh, I mean, I sent several emails to the people from, uh, O'Reilly and these, uh, both of them won't even have me on the show because he knows that, uh, I will go face to face with him.
[00:16:19.096 --> 00:16:23.580]  And, uh, you know, the first question that I will ask him, were you there?
[00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:25.341]  Were you there?
[00:16:25.341 --> 00:16:31.667]  How can you speak about something you have no experience whatsoever on what happened on that day?
[00:16:31.667 --> 00:16:32.908]  Very simple.
[00:16:32.908 --> 00:16:34.009]  And let's see what he responds.
[00:16:35.678 --> 00:16:38.222]  Well, he's not stupid, you know.
[00:16:38.222 --> 00:16:39.985]  O'Reilly used to be anti-New World Order.
[00:16:39.985 --> 00:16:44.772]  We've got a bunch of clips of him from JFK to the Illuminati, and he really sold out.
[00:16:44.772 --> 00:16:45.913]  That makes him even worse.
[00:16:46.621 --> 00:16:55.889]  You know, and the other thing, I mean, news aside was that I just read an article that says a professor who criticized Bush was added to terrorist no-fly list.
[00:16:55.889 --> 00:16:57.671]  Oh yeah, that's mainstream news, yeah.
[00:16:57.671 --> 00:16:59.132]  That's in a law journal, yeah.
[00:16:59.132 --> 00:17:01.474]  Yeah, it's incredible, but you know what?
[00:17:01.474 --> 00:17:02.495]  Welcome to my world.
[00:17:02.495 --> 00:17:11.502]  Remember, I'm a recognized personality and hero by both governments, and I have been put on the same no-fly list.
[00:17:11.502 --> 00:17:14.245]  I am on the no-fly list for more than two years.
[00:17:15.029 --> 00:17:16.629]  And it's funny because people don't understand it.
[00:17:16.629 --> 00:17:22.390]  Sometimes they stop me in the airport, put me in a room, and they ask me, we don't understand why you're on this list.
[00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:24.711]  People that recognize me from television.
[00:17:24.711 --> 00:17:26.511]  They say, how can they put you on this list?
[00:17:26.511 --> 00:17:29.572]  You're, you know, you're such a recognized person for what you did on 9-11.
[00:17:29.572 --> 00:17:32.272]  They say, well, there it goes.
[00:17:32.272 --> 00:17:39.814]  I talk against the administration and what they have done to eliminate the civil rights and how they have used 9-11 as an agenda for propaganda.
[00:17:40.527 --> 00:17:41.928]  And they put me right there.
[00:17:41.928 --> 00:17:43.408]  I'm probably on the top of the list.
[00:17:43.408 --> 00:17:46.870]  And for those that don't know, they ransack your bags.
[00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:48.470]  Frankly, I'm on it, folks.
[00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:51.592]  They lose them every time, if you're even able to get on the airplane.
[00:17:51.592 --> 00:17:54.713]  And then they put my family on the list, but I don't like to give them attention.
[00:17:54.713 --> 00:17:55.433]  We'll be right back.
[00:17:55.433 --> 00:18:01.656]  Stay with us.
[00:18:01.656 --> 00:18:03.477]  It's here, after a year in production.
[00:21:22.037 --> 00:21:25.884]  Traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:21:25.884 --> 00:21:33.538]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:21:34.218 --> 00:21:41.662]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:21:41.662 --> 00:21:53.407]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:21:53.407 --> 00:21:57.369]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:21:57.369 --> 00:21:59.630]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:03.492]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:21.724]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:22:21.724 --> 00:22:29.188]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[00:22:29.188 --> 00:22:33.111]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria.
[00:22:33.311 --> 00:22:39.996]  Cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[00:22:39.996 --> 00:22:44.839]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[00:22:44.839 --> 00:22:49.803]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water like food coloring particles.
[00:22:50.023 --> 00:22:53.185]  Yeah, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:22:53.185 --> 00:23:03.090]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black Berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.
[00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:07.973]  Get a two-pack for only $99 or a four-pack for only $188 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:23:16.698 --> 00:23:18.639]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:23:18.639 --> 00:23:22.661]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[00:23:22.661 --> 00:23:25.382]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions.
[00:23:25.382 --> 00:23:31.746]  Credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more, all in the hands of a total stranger.
[00:23:31.746 --> 00:23:36.868]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door because you left it unlocked.
[00:23:36.868 --> 00:23:38.609]  Every time you walk away from your computer,
[00:23:38.629 --> 00:23:39.209]  We're good to go.
[00:24:08.488 --> 00:24:10.630]  Visit NET7TECH.COM.
[00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:15.754]  That's NET, the number 7, TECH.COM, and start protecting yourself today.
[00:24:15.754 --> 00:24:25.262]  Look at your young men fighting.
[00:24:25.262 --> 00:24:27.544]  Look at your women crying.
[00:24:27.544 --> 00:24:31.627]  Look at your young men dying.
[00:24:31.627 --> 00:24:36.891]  The way they've always done before.
[00:24:47.201 --> 00:25:03.749]  Look at the hate we're breeding Look at the fear we're feeding Look at the lives we're leading The way we've always done before
[00:25:05.749 --> 00:25:07.090]  Welcome back.
[00:25:07.090 --> 00:25:09.631]  You know, we don't have time to play that again, but we did play it.
[00:25:09.631 --> 00:25:12.252]  I've got the raw audio file.
[00:25:12.252 --> 00:25:13.833]  We're gonna post it.
[00:25:13.833 --> 00:25:17.354]  We'll post it with the questions that William did ask.
[00:25:17.354 --> 00:25:21.736]  We even have a little computer slideshow we put together, so we'd know the questions.
[00:25:21.736 --> 00:25:23.057]  Really nice of him to do that.
[00:25:23.886 --> 00:25:32.433]  William, it's got to be encouraging though, because Gandhi did say that first they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they attack you, then you win.
[00:25:32.433 --> 00:25:40.739]  And they are in the major attacking phase right now, and the truth is coming out, and time is on our side.
[00:25:40.739 --> 00:25:47.565]  Do you think they'll try to stage another 9-11 to smokescreen the fact that we're exposing them on the last attack they carried out?
[00:25:48.465 --> 00:25:52.849]  As we get closer to the truth, that's exactly what's going to happen.
[00:25:52.849 --> 00:26:01.337]  It's their modus operandi, and they need to basically bypass the attention of the world to something new.
[00:26:01.337 --> 00:26:04.040]  They need to keep people on their toes.
[00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:07.843]  And exactly what you said, they will need to stage something new.
[00:26:07.843 --> 00:26:08.304]  I believe that.
[00:26:09.301 --> 00:26:19.284]  Now, you went down to Venezuela and then just a few weeks after you guys were there and you talked to the head of the parliament and got your info to the president, he went public saying 9-11's an inside job.
[00:26:19.284 --> 00:26:24.565]  You know, we here in the U.S., the majority believe there's a cover-up and the majority of that majority inside job.
[00:26:24.565 --> 00:26:31.627]  But overseas, you've been all over the world, from England to, you know, the Middle East to East Asia.
[00:26:31.627 --> 00:26:32.367]  What's going on?
[00:26:32.367 --> 00:26:33.967]  What percentage overseas know the truth? 99%.
[00:26:37.367 --> 00:26:38.248]  It's incredible.
[00:26:38.248 --> 00:26:51.059]  Everybody's just like... In the tour, for example, the last two tours that I have done, I probably received from hundreds and hundreds of audiences that I presented the information only to dissenting voices.
[00:26:51.059 --> 00:26:52.401]  And that's incredible.
[00:26:52.401 --> 00:26:55.523]  I mean, even by anybody's standards.
[00:26:55.523 --> 00:27:00.688]  And the dissenting voice was usually somebody from the control media.
[00:27:01.559 --> 00:27:04.721]  But from the audience, all I got was support.
[00:27:04.721 --> 00:27:05.961]  Look, it's simple.
[00:27:05.961 --> 00:27:06.441]  Yeah.
[00:27:06.441 --> 00:27:07.042]  It's simple.
[00:27:07.042 --> 00:27:15.566]  The bad guys have taken over America, and the bad guys always, you can go on for a long time, but sooner or later, God's going to cut you down.
[00:27:15.566 --> 00:27:18.447]  And I think they've gone, in fact, I know they've gone too far.
[00:27:18.447 --> 00:27:25.171]  Do you think, though, they're still full of hubris and arrogance and bravado and, you know, are still macho about this, William Rodriguez?
[00:27:25.171 --> 00:27:27.772]  Or do you think the elite's starting to figure out they're in trouble?
[00:27:29.048 --> 00:27:38.255]  They know they're in trouble, but they're still keeping their machismo stance because they think that nobody can take them out.
[00:27:38.255 --> 00:27:40.396]  But they have a surprise coming.
[00:27:40.396 --> 00:27:49.062]  Because once we start identifying people and whistleblowers, the problem with the United States is that they effectively eliminated the Whistleblower Act.
[00:27:49.062 --> 00:27:57.448]  There is no way to protect anybody to come out publicly from the government and speak about crimes inside the administration.
[00:27:58.166 --> 00:27:58.326]  Yeah.
[00:28:14.474 --> 00:28:17.256]  But now the costs are so high, though, they're being forced to.
[00:28:17.256 --> 00:28:18.917]  William, it's always great to have you on.
[00:28:18.917 --> 00:28:20.438]  Thanks for spending time with us.
[00:28:20.438 --> 00:28:28.983]  And there may be some big news this week or next week, and you'll be the first to tell us about it, and we'll be here to let everybody know about what's going on, because we're privy to the same info.
[00:28:28.983 --> 00:28:31.464]  And so we'll be talking to you very, very soon, my friend.
[00:28:31.464 --> 00:28:36.087]  His film, his presentation, available at InfoWars.com.
[00:28:36.087 --> 00:28:38.689]  William Rodriguez, What Really Happened on 9-11.
[00:28:38.689 --> 00:28:39.249]  Get it today.
[00:28:39.249 --> 00:28:40.790]  William, talk to you soon.
[00:28:40.790 --> 00:28:41.190]  You got it.
[00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:41.590]  All the best.
[00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:41.951]  Bye-bye.
[00:28:41.951 --> 00:28:44.112]  We're going to write an article about it and get your audio up, okay?
[00:28:44.938 --> 00:28:45.379]  Got it.
[00:28:45.379 --> 00:28:46.221]  Good job, my friend.
[00:28:46.221 --> 00:28:47.143]  God bless.
[00:28:47.143 --> 00:28:48.286]  Back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[00:28:48.286 --> 00:28:49.348]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
[00:28:49.348 --> 00:28:50.210]  God bless you all.
[00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:51.253]  Thanks for tuning in.
[00:28:51.253 --> 00:28:52.295]  Thanks for taking action.
[00:28:52.295 --> 00:28:53.819]  Now get out there and take on the new world order.
