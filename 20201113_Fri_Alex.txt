[00:00.000 --> 00:11.000]  It is Friday, November 13th, the year is 2020, open world government is being announced,
[00:11.000 --> 00:15.000]  U.N. concentration camps are being publicly announced, we will break all the information
[00:15.000 --> 00:16.000]  now.
[00:16.000 --> 00:19.300]  Spread the word, Paul Reverez, this is not a drill.
[00:19.300 --> 00:24.880]  The hypocrisy of the left continues its criminal path toward completing the bidding of the
[00:24.880 --> 00:25.880]  New World Order.
[00:25.880 --> 00:32.200]  The World Federalist Association, or WFA, is one of the largest organizations that openly
[00:32.200 --> 00:34.200]  promote world government.
[00:34.200 --> 00:41.080]  1993, the WFA honored an editor for Time Magazine for an essay he had written entitled, The
[00:41.080 --> 00:43.080]  Birth of a Global Nation.
[00:43.080 --> 00:48.800]  Nationhood, as we know it, will be obsolete, all states will recognize a single global
[00:48.800 --> 00:49.800]  authority.
[00:49.800 --> 00:55.800]  And we are in the midst of one of the historic global transformations that is going to advance
[00:55.800 --> 00:58.520]  and eventually lead to a New World Order.
[00:58.520 --> 01:03.160]  The shape of that we don't know at this point, but we know the processes that are underway.
[01:03.160 --> 01:12.280]  The affirmative task we have now is to actually create a new world order.
[01:12.280 --> 01:17.360]  It's overwhelming our interest that China prosper.
[01:17.360 --> 01:19.520]  We have to level the playing field.
[01:19.520 --> 01:27.680]  I believe we, and particularly you, your class, has an incredible window of opportunity to
[01:27.680 --> 01:34.480]  lead in shaping a New World Order for the 21st century.
[01:34.480 --> 01:41.240]  Democracy, freedom, openness that we cherish is under threat from within and from without
[01:41.240 --> 01:48.080]  by the siren call of this phony nationalism and populism and xenophobia that exists in
[01:48.080 --> 01:50.880]  many western democracies today.
[01:50.880 --> 02:01.000]  All has changed, changed utterly in the last 15 years, and a terrible beauty has been born.
[02:01.000 --> 02:06.360]  As the Washington Examiner explains, just four years after the Obama administration
[02:06.360 --> 02:11.560]  authorized the secret surveillance of Michael Flynn for his communications with Russian
[02:11.560 --> 02:18.680]  Ambassador Sergei Kislak, Ben Rhodes has boasted that Joe Biden is already talking to foreign
[02:18.680 --> 02:23.160]  leaders while another president rules the White House.
[02:23.160 --> 02:28.360]  Ready to congratulate you and congratulate Kamala Harris for this election.
[02:28.360 --> 02:34.360]  This of course violates the Logan Act, but Biden isn't wasting any time kneeling to his
[02:34.360 --> 02:39.560]  foreign overlords to dismantle everything President Trump did to protect the United
[02:39.560 --> 02:40.560]  States.
[02:40.560 --> 02:45.760]  Mr. McCabe, yesterday on MSNBC, Ben Rhodes, the former deputy national security adviser
[02:45.760 --> 02:50.560]  to President Obama, said that foreign leaders are already having conversations with Joe
[02:50.560 --> 02:55.840]  Biden, quote, talking about the agenda they're going to pursue January 20th.
[02:55.840 --> 02:59.720]  Mr. McCabe, based on that testimony, do you believe Joe Biden is violating the Logan
[02:59.720 --> 03:00.720]  Act?
[03:00.720 --> 03:05.080]  I'm not aware of Ben Rhodes' statements.
[03:05.080 --> 03:08.480]  He is talking with foreign leaders and it doesn't violate the Logan Act because the
[03:08.480 --> 03:12.960]  Logan Act is unconstitutional, which is why it's never been used to prosecute anyone.
[03:12.960 --> 03:18.520]  You authorized using it to go after General Flynn as part of a political persecution.
[03:18.520 --> 03:19.520]  I can give you the answer.
[03:19.520 --> 03:22.080]  Hell no, Joe Biden is not violating the Logan Act.
[03:22.080 --> 03:27.500]  The reason you won't say it is because that was your flimsy political basis to go after
[03:27.500 --> 03:32.120]  a decorated war hero because you disagreed politically with President Trump.
[03:32.120 --> 03:37.840]  Biden will reverse travel restrictions from countries sponsoring terrorism like Libya,
[03:37.840 --> 03:42.360]  Iraq, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Yemen and Iran.
[03:42.360 --> 03:46.120]  Biden also seeks to re-enter the Iranian nuclear deal.
[03:46.120 --> 03:51.840]  Biden plans to re-institute DACA and Biden will also rejoin the Paris Climate Accord
[03:51.840 --> 03:54.880]  and resume funding for the World Health Organization.
[03:54.880 --> 04:00.240]  Of course, these are all initiatives by the Bilderberg Cartel, promoting the disintegration
[04:00.240 --> 04:04.080]  of United States sovereignty in favor of their New World Order.
[04:04.080 --> 04:09.880]  About 140 participants this year, including the chief executive of Google, the chancellor
[04:09.880 --> 04:15.440]  of this country, and the former head of the CIA, churned executive for the private equity
[04:15.440 --> 04:17.280]  firm KKR.
[04:17.280 --> 04:19.720]  They're here at this event.
[04:19.720 --> 04:23.320]  If you've never heard of the Bilderberg conference, don't be worried.
[04:23.320 --> 04:25.160]  I've been in the news business for about two decades.
[04:25.160 --> 04:26.280]  I've never heard of it.
[04:26.280 --> 04:29.720]  That's because the organizers don't really want you to know about it.
[04:29.720 --> 04:32.640]  It is very secret, a very guarded affair.
[04:32.640 --> 04:38.560]  If Joe Biden does steal the Oval Office, he will face a country where at least half of
[04:38.560 --> 04:45.080]  the population despises him, where a movement will exponentially grow against his occupation.
[04:45.080 --> 04:49.240]  Fertile ground for a false flag blamed on patriots.
[04:49.240 --> 04:51.920]  John Bowne reported.
[04:51.920 --> 04:53.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, stay with us.
[04:53.680 --> 04:54.680]  Spread the word now.
[04:54.680 --> 04:56.080]  We are now in the New World Order.
[04:56.080 --> 04:57.080]  We are fighting for our lives.
[04:57.080 --> 05:23.480]  I'm going to get worse from here unless you fight back.
[05:23.480 --> 05:49.880]  I'm going to get worse from here unless you fight back.
[05:49.880 --> 06:08.280]  I'm going to get worse from here unless you fight back.
[06:19.880 --> 06:49.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are standing at the historic crossroads and we are now passing
[06:49.440 --> 06:56.480]  out of the crossroads into a path of absolute hell on earth, concentration camps, forced
[06:56.480 --> 06:59.920]  inoculations, and mass death.
[06:59.920 --> 07:01.280]  We are still at the crossroads.
[07:01.280 --> 07:07.240]  We still have a chance to go down another path, but if Trump cannot defeat this communist
[07:07.240 --> 07:14.440]  globalist takeover, we are being sucked into the black hole vortex.
[07:14.440 --> 07:15.440]  We have all the proof.
[07:15.440 --> 07:22.360]  The whole public, it's all hiding in plain view.
[07:22.360 --> 07:29.040]  We all have to get very conscious about this and understand that we're not in the normal
[07:29.040 --> 07:34.120]  incremental globalist takeover anymore that's already been horrible.
[07:34.120 --> 07:39.960]  Everything you've seen has been probing and conditioning and a readying process for what
[07:39.960 --> 07:46.080]  is now about to unfold and I want to lay out for you at the bottom of the hour as best
[07:46.080 --> 07:48.600]  I can what is now going to unfold.
[07:48.600 --> 07:51.840]  The headline for the show today is a shocking headline.
[07:51.840 --> 07:52.840]  It's totally true.
[07:52.840 --> 07:53.840]  We have all the admissions.
[07:53.840 --> 07:55.680]  We have the UN saying it.
[07:55.680 --> 07:56.680]  We have them preparing it.
[07:56.680 --> 08:01.240]  Now we have them implementing it and we have the Democrats, the communists, the socialists,
[08:01.240 --> 08:08.080]  the labor parties of the world all singing from the exact same sheets of music with big
[08:08.080 --> 08:13.920]  tech enforcing it along with mainstream corporate enemy of the people media and the mainstream
[08:13.920 --> 08:19.600]  is authoritarianism, AI surveillance, social credit scores, children being taken from their
[08:19.600 --> 08:26.320]  parents by the state, forced inoculations, medical passports to even have a job or leave
[08:26.320 --> 08:27.320]  your house.
[08:27.320 --> 08:33.120]  But then when you refuse to take the vaccine, you will be taken to an emergency camp and
[08:33.120 --> 08:34.640]  many people will never be seen again.
[08:34.640 --> 08:36.680]  They're going to claim you died in the camp.
[08:36.680 --> 08:40.840]  They're going to inject you and they're going to innovate you and murder you.
[08:40.840 --> 08:43.240]  That is their plan and the documents are out.
[08:43.240 --> 08:45.880]  So this is all the smoke screen cover.
[08:45.880 --> 08:50.240]  That's why suddenly you see massive fraud.
[08:50.240 --> 08:52.280]  Suddenly you see massive criminal activity.
[08:52.280 --> 08:58.960]  Everything you already witnessed is now turned up tenfold and this morning I was sent a video
[08:58.960 --> 09:08.280]  of a doctor doing a online TV podcast answering Lister's questions and he's talking about
[09:08.280 --> 09:14.480]  a document from six months ago when the Labor Party of Canada and it's a confirmed document.
[09:14.480 --> 09:17.080]  I went and pulled it up in Reuters.
[09:17.080 --> 09:19.800]  We're talking about how the big lockdown is coming, how there's going to be exponential
[09:19.800 --> 09:22.880]  cases because of testing, which they already know it's out set up.
[09:22.880 --> 09:24.840]  Everyone's going to end up getting COVID.
[09:24.840 --> 09:28.200]  It's designed to reinfect where you're all suspects.
[09:28.200 --> 09:32.640]  They can divide the public against each other, set up a secret police to contact racers and
[09:32.640 --> 09:35.320]  give the leftist all badges and guns.
[09:35.320 --> 09:37.480]  That's why they're in the process of overthrowing the police.
[09:37.480 --> 09:39.040]  They're not getting rid of the police.
[09:39.040 --> 09:42.040]  You're about to be in a real police state.
[09:42.040 --> 09:48.200]  Everything you saw in the worst parts of Australia run by leftist mayors under UN command and
[09:48.200 --> 09:53.960]  paid by the Communist Chinese government, one mayor over a billion dollars in Australia
[09:53.960 --> 09:57.560]  has now been duplicated in Europe, the UK and now here.
[09:57.560 --> 10:02.120]  The only presidents really fighting this are in Eastern Europe and in Brazil and the United
[10:02.120 --> 10:08.200]  States and they're all under incredible attack, but Bolsonaro and Trump are absolute brigades.
[10:08.200 --> 10:12.240]  They are fortresses against this and that's why they're under such attack.
[10:12.240 --> 10:13.240]  This is a very serious time.
[10:13.240 --> 10:15.280]  Everybody understand something?
[10:15.280 --> 10:16.760]  You don't get out of this by submitting.
[10:16.760 --> 10:18.160]  You don't get out of this by being scared.
[10:18.160 --> 10:20.840]  You don't get out of this by going along with them.
[10:20.840 --> 10:23.200]  They're coming for everyone.
[10:23.200 --> 10:25.200]  They're going to wipe out the third world.
[10:25.200 --> 10:26.640]  This is only phase one.
[10:26.640 --> 10:31.360]  Once you've gone to lockdown for about two or three years, then the real bio weapons
[10:31.360 --> 10:32.360]  get released.
[10:32.360 --> 10:34.080]  I've told you this for decades.
[10:34.080 --> 10:37.840]  Gates said it a few months ago, he said, this is just a drill.
[10:37.840 --> 10:43.280]  The real thing's coming from terrorists and he and Colbert began to have a visual satanic
[10:43.280 --> 10:47.080]  type of gleeful orgasm.
[10:47.080 --> 10:48.520]  We have their battle plans.
[10:48.520 --> 10:49.520]  We know what they're doing.
[10:49.520 --> 10:55.000]  I know this has always sounded extreme and horrible, but it's the truth.
[10:55.000 --> 10:58.320]  Now, that's all coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[10:58.320 --> 10:59.320]  We have some video.
[10:59.320 --> 11:00.320]  I'm going to show you the Reuters articles.
[11:00.320 --> 11:06.600]  I'm going to show you local videos out of French, Quebec, Montreal, and I'm going to
[11:06.600 --> 11:11.320]  show you the health department heads saying, we're coming in your house forcibly testing
[11:11.320 --> 11:12.800]  you, even if no one's sick.
[11:12.800 --> 11:14.280]  We're taking your children.
[11:14.280 --> 11:18.120]  If anyone is sick, we're going to separate your family.
[11:18.120 --> 11:19.120]  Now understand that.
[11:19.120 --> 11:21.480]  Now remember, it's never going to go away.
[11:21.480 --> 11:25.860]  The people resist going to the camps next year, they're going to say, see, COVID didn't
[11:25.860 --> 11:29.920]  go away because you resisted and didn't go to the camps and take your shots.
[11:29.920 --> 11:30.920]  That's how the rollout works.
[11:30.920 --> 11:32.200]  Oh, you didn't wear your mask right.
[11:32.200 --> 11:33.920]  The lockdown wasn't long enough.
[11:33.920 --> 11:36.120]  Oh, you didn't submit enough.
[11:36.120 --> 11:39.200]  And then now here we are already into the next cycle.
[11:39.200 --> 11:40.200]  Okay.
[11:40.200 --> 11:43.920]  Here we are already into the next beginning of the next year, 10 months into this, they're
[11:43.920 --> 11:48.000]  launching their new operation, not in January, but in November.
[11:48.000 --> 11:52.000]  On the 5th of November, when they launched it all over the world, the UN announcement
[11:52.000 --> 11:55.160]  that you're going to take the inoculations, you're going to be taken from your family.
[11:55.160 --> 11:56.600]  Your business is not essential.
[11:56.600 --> 11:58.080]  The police are coming to watch you.
[11:58.080 --> 12:00.480]  They're backed up by leftist social workers.
[12:00.480 --> 12:04.440]  And they talk in these labor documents what the UN talks about.
[12:04.440 --> 12:10.560]  It's all just from the UN down saying, we started the big cities, we show everyone on TV that
[12:10.560 --> 12:11.560]  it's normal.
[12:11.560 --> 12:12.560]  We normalize it.
[12:12.560 --> 12:14.080]  That's how the Communists took over Russia.
[12:14.080 --> 12:16.480]  They only had Moscow for a couple of years.
[12:16.480 --> 12:21.800]  And they show you it's normal in the newsreels on the radio and now on the TV and the internet.
[12:21.800 --> 12:22.800]  Everyone else is blocked.
[12:22.800 --> 12:26.200]  And as we told you what happened, the media is asking the independent media, oh, is it
[12:26.200 --> 12:27.200]  true?
[12:27.200 --> 12:30.400]  Suddenly people can't stop the steel videos on their iPhones.
[12:30.400 --> 12:32.600]  Oh, suddenly people can't do instant messenger.
[12:32.600 --> 12:35.200]  Is it censorship?
[12:35.200 --> 12:38.880]  They announced last year on CNN that they were going to start blocking instant messages
[12:38.880 --> 12:39.880]  and text messages.
[12:39.880 --> 12:42.520]  And now they're saying they're going to be monitoring you live time.
[12:42.520 --> 12:47.600]  The networks are the big telecoms for what you're saying over the phone and cutting your
[12:47.600 --> 12:49.840]  phone off if you speak improperly.
[12:49.840 --> 12:52.920]  That's why they're making everyone stay at home so they can monitor everything over the
[12:52.920 --> 12:55.320]  Skype, over the Zoom, over the phones.
[12:55.320 --> 13:00.120]  This is AI, machine learning, forcing all of us into it.
[13:00.120 --> 13:03.400]  You know, like in the original Tron, when he wants all the little programs being merged
[13:03.400 --> 13:09.800]  to him, they're all being thrown in, they're all, I mean, that's the metaphor for tyranny.
[13:09.800 --> 13:14.920]  They're forcing everyone onto the phones, everyone onto the computers to live, which
[13:14.920 --> 13:19.200]  then forces everything over to robots and computers and automation so that it can actually
[13:19.200 --> 13:20.200]  take over.
[13:20.200 --> 13:23.800]  So we're having our legs cut out from under us, our voices taken away.
[13:23.800 --> 13:27.640]  This isn't just old liberals that mean well and woke folks that went a little too far
[13:27.640 --> 13:29.080]  and ha, ha, ha.
[13:29.080 --> 13:34.440]  This is an incremental program where they change the Overton window and where they're
[13:34.440 --> 13:40.760]  always again pushing what's acceptable to narrow and narrow our fields while they turn
[13:40.760 --> 13:46.560]  their rabble into a group of authoritarians that are there to bully us into submission.
[13:46.560 --> 13:48.560]  Now thank God we still have a constitution.
[13:48.560 --> 13:52.040]  That's why federal and state courts have ruled, and there was another ruling today against
[13:52.040 --> 13:55.840]  the Democrats, that they're not allowed to have these lockdowns, no matter what Biden
[13:55.840 --> 13:59.400]  says or what anybody says, but they just don't care.
[13:59.400 --> 14:06.640]  When the courts tell them they can't do this, when the courts pull this, pull the constitution
[14:06.640 --> 14:11.240]  out, then the leftist says, we don't care.
[14:11.240 --> 14:15.080]  We are the cities, we are the states, we are the bureaucrats, we are the businesses.
[14:15.080 --> 14:18.040]  We are in charge and we're not budging.
[14:18.040 --> 14:27.480]  So it's a form of siege, of sabotage, of civil disobedience.
[14:27.480 --> 14:32.200]  This is civil disobedience, asymmetrical warfare.
[14:32.200 --> 14:39.200]  Sabotage comes from the French word of putting your sandal in the gears at a factory.
[14:39.200 --> 14:43.120]  And literally, because workers will get tired of working 18 hours a day during the start
[14:43.120 --> 14:49.960]  of the Industrial Revolution, and they would just throw their shoes into the machine, sabotage,
[14:49.960 --> 14:53.280]  putting your sandal into the machine.
[14:53.280 --> 14:55.120]  And so, but this is the big bankers.
[14:55.120 --> 14:59.200]  This is the robber barons who didn't know how to deal with people sabotaging them.
[14:59.200 --> 15:05.120]  So they built a system to control us, where they sabotage us, bring us to our knees and
[15:05.120 --> 15:06.120]  hold us hostage.
[15:06.120 --> 15:11.120]  And they call it a lockdown, a term developed in the United States for when the people get
[15:11.120 --> 15:16.200]  unruly, when there's a riot, they learn don't just punish the people who start it.
[15:16.200 --> 15:18.560]  Lock the whole prison down for a week or two.
[15:18.560 --> 15:21.720]  Don't let folks come out of their cells, make them eat in their cells.
[15:21.720 --> 15:22.720]  Don't let them go lift weights.
[15:22.720 --> 15:24.000]  Don't let them go work.
[15:24.000 --> 15:28.480]  Don't let them, you know, be a custodian and go, you know, mow the lawn of the state capital
[15:28.480 --> 15:29.800]  or whatever.
[15:29.800 --> 15:31.000]  Make you stay in your house.
[15:31.000 --> 15:32.640]  You're under a lockdown.
[15:32.640 --> 15:34.920]  This was just baby training the last eight months.
[15:34.920 --> 15:38.080]  Now they're going to bring out what you saw in Australia, what you saw in Spain, and they
[15:38.080 --> 15:39.720]  admit that's the model.
[15:39.720 --> 15:44.280]  And they're coming with their special police political units to your house.
[15:44.280 --> 15:48.080]  And they are going to drag you out, and they are going to take you to a facility in this
[15:48.080 --> 15:49.080]  phase.
[15:49.080 --> 15:53.520]  But next year, they're going to take you and kill you with a intubation, the new execution
[15:53.520 --> 15:55.520]  systems aren't guillotines.
[15:55.520 --> 15:56.520]  They're ventilators.
[15:56.520 --> 16:01.960]  Election 2020 is here, and whether Trump wins or loses, we have all won by exposing the
[16:01.960 --> 16:07.920]  Communist Chinese, by exposing the globalist, by exposing the pedophile rings, by exposing
[16:07.920 --> 16:11.040]  the fact this is really a fight between good versus evil.
[16:11.040 --> 16:15.040]  Now I'm personally a Christian and I believe in God, and I know God's real and I've experienced
[16:15.040 --> 16:16.040]  it in my life.
[16:16.040 --> 16:18.040]  Believe you don't believe in God.
[16:18.040 --> 16:20.480]  It's important to recognize that there is good in this world.
[16:20.480 --> 16:21.480]  There is evil.
[16:21.480 --> 16:25.760]  And there are people out there that want to do you harm because they enjoy doing that.
[16:25.760 --> 16:31.120]  And what I see happening across the spectrum of different political views is people finally
[16:31.120 --> 16:35.720]  get that, they finally understand that they're not being naive anymore.
[16:35.720 --> 16:41.560]  Don't ever project your decency and your goodness onto other people until they've proven what
[16:41.560 --> 16:44.840]  they stand for and who they are, or you're going to get hurt.
[16:44.840 --> 16:48.000]  But those of you out there that have done your own research and discovered who's good
[16:48.000 --> 16:52.080]  and who is faithful, will then come together with those organizations and support them
[16:52.080 --> 16:53.080]  like in full wars.
[16:53.080 --> 16:56.400]  Without your support, in full wars would not exist.
[16:56.400 --> 16:59.000]  Alex Jones here with an important message, all of our listeners and viewers.
[16:59.000 --> 17:00.400]  I want to thank you for your support over the years.
[17:00.400 --> 17:04.560]  I want to thank you for having skin in the game and no one has had more skin in the
[17:04.560 --> 17:06.320]  game than our president.
[17:06.320 --> 17:07.320]  And he needs our prayers.
[17:07.320 --> 17:08.320]  He needs our support.
[17:08.320 --> 17:12.880]  He is the president, Secretary of State Pompeo understands that's why he said yesterday
[17:12.880 --> 17:18.720]  we will be a smooth transition from this Trump administration into the next Trump administration
[17:18.720 --> 17:24.120]  because in all the major states where they're still counting, they are gaining ground.
[17:24.120 --> 17:28.840]  That is President Trump, Republican Party, the American people, the populace, the patriots,
[17:28.840 --> 17:32.920]  the enemy, the Democrats, backed by the shy comms, backed by the European Union, backed
[17:32.920 --> 17:36.200]  by Hollywood, backed by the left, the blue cities, the blue states.
[17:36.200 --> 17:41.720]  They are in a rage trying to gaslight us, keep calling Biden president-elect, he's not.
[17:41.720 --> 17:46.360]  It has to concede and or all of the states have to certify the vote, which hasn't happened
[17:46.360 --> 17:47.360]  yet.
[17:47.360 --> 17:51.400]  And then you have to have the electors seek who is going to be the president and this
[17:51.400 --> 17:53.440]  may be a dispute that goes back to the states.
[17:53.440 --> 17:59.480]  That's why it's in the Constitution and the Constitution is kicking in.
[17:59.480 --> 18:23.800]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:23.800 --> 18:31.480]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance, live from the InfoWars.com
[18:31.480 --> 18:34.480]  studios, it's Alex Jones.
[18:34.480 --> 18:40.880]  All right, we come to you live from Washington, D.C.
[18:40.880 --> 18:41.880]  I am Alex Jones, your host.
[18:41.880 --> 18:43.360]  I'm very, very honored to be here.
[18:43.360 --> 18:46.640]  We have the big historic March tomorrow.
[18:46.640 --> 18:48.720]  We caught Antifa on the way here.
[18:48.720 --> 18:57.000]  They were following us from Florida up into Virginia now into D.C. posing as patriots
[18:57.000 --> 18:59.960]  in handing out white supremacist literature.
[18:59.960 --> 19:02.640]  So that's going to be their main mission tomorrow.
[19:02.640 --> 19:09.040]  We actually caught them on video red-handed and we actually intercepted their communications
[19:09.040 --> 19:15.320]  through a source and they, through a mole, I was telling them, we've infiltrated them
[19:15.320 --> 19:20.520]  and they're planning to dress like MAGA folks at the March tomorrow.
[19:20.520 --> 19:28.000]  We'll be wearing their red baseball caps backwards and wearing camouflage pants is how they're
[19:28.000 --> 19:29.000]  dressing.
[19:29.000 --> 19:31.320]  So we've got that to look forward to.
[19:31.320 --> 19:32.320]  This is the true scum.
[19:32.320 --> 19:35.800]  It wants to deny us third-dimensional access to the streets.
[19:35.800 --> 19:44.240]  We have big tech everywhere, admittedly blocking everyone now online and then now over their
[19:44.240 --> 19:49.560]  phones and many text messages and email services not letting people sin, stop, steal, or videos
[19:49.560 --> 19:53.840]  exposing election fraud because you can't have all these election officials coming on
[19:53.840 --> 19:55.120]  saying they saw fraud.
[19:55.120 --> 19:58.120]  You can't have the racists that are going back to Republicans all over the country as
[19:58.120 --> 20:01.760]  they go in and look at the machines, everything flipping against Trump.
[20:01.760 --> 20:02.760]  They can't have this coming out.
[20:02.760 --> 20:08.480]  They have to just keep saying to everyone over and over and over again, it is a hoax.
[20:08.480 --> 20:10.560]  There is no election fraud.
[20:10.560 --> 20:13.480]  Even though Georgia officials looked about and said, yeah, we found a bunch of fraud.
[20:13.480 --> 20:17.000]  There's thousands of dead people they've already found in Michigan and Pennsylvania and we
[20:17.000 --> 20:23.080]  know the ballots were sent out so they could stuff the deck before and stuff it after.
[20:23.080 --> 20:26.000]  Then we have the mathematicians that have looked at it and they tell you how it's two
[20:26.000 --> 20:32.320]  companies, Dominion and of course, Staples Street, they're having the quote anomalies
[20:32.320 --> 20:36.080]  and the patches that private companies came in and put on the day before the election
[20:36.080 --> 20:40.000]  in these battleground states and all the weird food trucks and other vehicles showing up
[20:40.000 --> 20:43.320]  in the middle of the night that had swipe guards after everything's closed and going in with
[20:43.320 --> 20:45.800]  the big boxes of ballots.
[20:45.800 --> 20:46.960]  This was insane.
[20:46.960 --> 20:48.800]  The globalists are in full panic mode.
[20:48.800 --> 20:50.200]  Yes, it's bad they're moving against us.
[20:50.200 --> 20:51.840]  Yes, it's bad they're totally criminal.
[20:51.840 --> 20:55.840]  Yes, it's bad they've taken the mask off, taken the gloves off.
[20:55.840 --> 21:00.080]  But this is because there was a landslide for Trump.
[21:00.080 --> 21:03.040]  They tried to manipulate the polls, but they still couldn't.
[21:03.040 --> 21:09.520]  Real internal polling shows as much as 50% of black males now supporting President Trump.
[21:09.520 --> 21:14.280]  That's five times whatever was exit polls showed 36%.
[21:14.280 --> 21:18.360]  That's triple whatever was black females about 35%.
[21:18.360 --> 21:20.440]  That's about triple what it used to be.
[21:20.440 --> 21:22.120]  Same thing with Hispanics is even higher.
[21:22.120 --> 21:25.700]  There is a total awakening what the Democrats do.
[21:25.700 --> 21:28.320]  They don't want a big tent for America.
[21:28.320 --> 21:32.000]  They want people to hate America and believe it's bad and evil so that all the brown people
[21:32.000 --> 21:35.800]  that live here that built this country and the brown people that are coming to the country
[21:35.800 --> 21:41.280]  hate their chance to be in a capitalist society and successful.
[21:41.280 --> 21:43.480]  And that's why it's total absolute race baiting.
[21:43.480 --> 21:49.200]  That's why the attorney general of Michigan who's a Southern private law center operative
[21:49.200 --> 21:51.560]  is saying it's racist to recount the votes.
[21:51.560 --> 21:52.720]  Don't do it.
[21:52.720 --> 21:57.120]  It's why they're harassing all the lawyers and their families from law firms and even
[21:57.120 --> 21:59.600]  the New York Times is saying you shouldn't have law firms.
[21:59.600 --> 22:02.640]  You shouldn't be able to have representation and go look at these things.
[22:02.640 --> 22:03.640]  That's the system.
[22:03.640 --> 22:07.240]  And the Democrats said they were going to contest all of this.
[22:07.240 --> 22:13.600]  So again, if it was just old fashioned Democrats earlier in the game who were just corrupt,
[22:13.600 --> 22:14.840]  I wouldn't be so concerned.
[22:14.840 --> 22:17.640]  We can make it out of that.
[22:17.640 --> 22:20.240]  The globalist want to break this country once and for all.
[22:20.240 --> 22:23.080]  I'm going to break it down next segment.
[22:23.080 --> 22:30.000]  But this is the admitted plan to only ratchet down the tourniquet, to only tighten up the
[22:30.000 --> 22:34.760]  noose around our necks, every successive point as all of this unfolds.
[22:34.760 --> 22:40.280]  Now I want to play you a clip of Joe Biden conceding the election.
[22:40.280 --> 22:41.280]  That's right.
[22:41.280 --> 22:45.040]  Here's Joe Biden conceding the presidential election.
[22:45.040 --> 22:46.040]  This is a real video.
[22:46.040 --> 22:47.440]  Here it is.
[22:47.440 --> 22:52.080]  There is one less candidate in the race for the presidency tonight, Delaware Senator Joseph
[22:52.080 --> 22:56.680]  Biden dropped out of the hunt today, saying the disclosures about his plagiarism in law
[22:56.680 --> 23:03.440]  school and his exaggerations about his academic record made it impossible for him to continue.
[23:03.440 --> 23:09.120]  I do it with incredible reluctance and it makes me angry.
[23:09.120 --> 23:15.200]  I'm angry with myself for having been put in a position, put myself in the position
[23:15.200 --> 23:17.640]  of having to make this choice.
[23:17.640 --> 23:21.880]  The Delaware Democrat is the second candidate to be forced from the race by questions of
[23:21.880 --> 23:23.760]  character and integrity.
[23:23.760 --> 23:26.720]  Gary Hart dropped out earlier this year.
[23:26.720 --> 23:31.320]  Meantime with Joseph Biden out of the race, Colorado Congresswoman Pat Schroeder may soon
[23:31.320 --> 23:35.640]  fill the spot vacated by the Delaware senator.
[23:35.640 --> 23:38.820]  So that was him, you know, decades ago.
[23:38.820 --> 23:40.840]  This is a disgraceful creature.
[23:40.840 --> 23:41.840]  That's why they put him in.
[23:41.840 --> 23:44.000]  This is the type of trash they have to get.
[23:44.000 --> 23:48.760]  Senile doesn't know what planet he's on, an enemy of this country who spent 47 years selling
[23:48.760 --> 23:49.760]  us out.
[23:49.760 --> 23:53.740]  And America did not reject President Trump.
[23:53.740 --> 24:03.320]  He didn't get triple the black votes and double the Hispanic votes he got.
[24:03.320 --> 24:06.720]  And he got record number four years ago.
[24:06.720 --> 24:13.760]  It's like five times the black male vote now than what other Republicans ever got.
[24:13.760 --> 24:18.020]  I mean, that's all you need to know right there, folks, is they lost control of people's
[24:18.020 --> 24:19.020]  minds.
[24:19.020 --> 24:27.520]  And I've talked to a ton of black folks here in D.C. and it's a black city.
[24:27.520 --> 24:29.100]  And I just ask them, hey, you like Trump?
[24:29.100 --> 24:30.600]  Absolutely, I like Trump.
[24:30.600 --> 24:31.600]  I'm driving down the road.
[24:31.600 --> 24:36.160]  I see black people all over the place wearing Trump office, Trump gear, and they are just
[24:36.160 --> 24:37.880]  so pissed, man.
[24:37.880 --> 24:39.840]  So good luck, New World Order.
[24:39.840 --> 24:40.840]  Good luck.
[24:40.840 --> 24:44.600]  Because you may get some idiots buying into your BS and all your leftists running around
[24:44.600 --> 24:46.160]  preaching race and division.
[24:46.160 --> 24:47.640]  People see through your crap.
[24:47.640 --> 24:51.120]  And now when Biden takes the prosperity away, he's able to get in and puts us into a depression
[24:51.120 --> 24:52.120]  and starts rounding folks up.
[24:52.120 --> 24:53.120]  Oh, and guess what?
[24:53.120 --> 24:55.160]  Biden's got something really good for black folks.
[24:55.160 --> 25:00.560]  Aziz Gil-Emanuel, the same one that says kill people at 75, death panels.
[25:00.560 --> 25:02.600]  His people are in the news on infowars.com.
[25:02.600 --> 25:05.920]  It's a big article.
[25:05.920 --> 25:07.360]  You can link right to the statements.
[25:07.360 --> 25:12.400]  It's an actual news article originally, and it's all right there.
[25:12.400 --> 25:18.440]  It's the blacks, Joe Biden's COVID-19 task force recommends withholding food stamps and
[25:18.440 --> 25:24.640]  rent assistance from those who refuse coronavirus vaccines, and they specifically say blacks
[25:24.640 --> 25:27.640]  really need it because they're twice as likely to get COVID.
[25:27.640 --> 25:31.760]  Yeah, because black people need about three times the sun as a white person.
[25:31.760 --> 25:33.720]  People that aren't along around the sun have white skins.
[25:33.720 --> 25:37.880]  They absorb it and get vitamin D. Blacks from the equator where they would get too much
[25:37.880 --> 25:39.720]  sun so they got skin to reflect it.
[25:39.720 --> 25:44.800]  But blacks live in northern clines, they tend to get more diseases and all sorts of problems
[25:44.800 --> 25:50.600]  because of vitamin D. So if you really want a virtue signal for real and help black folks,
[25:50.600 --> 25:54.520]  I walk around and tell black people, I just walk up and say, hey, they want to kill you,
[25:54.520 --> 25:57.600]  they don't want you to have vitamin D. And you need to get vitamin D if you want to stop
[25:57.600 --> 25:58.600]  COVID.
[25:58.600 --> 25:59.600]  They go, what do you mean?
[25:59.600 --> 26:03.200]  I go, well, you know, you got black skin and you don't absorb as much light, and you
[26:03.200 --> 26:04.200]  need it.
[26:04.200 --> 26:05.200]  Look into it.
[26:05.200 --> 26:06.200]  A lot of black folks, yeah, I know that.
[26:06.200 --> 26:07.200]  You're right.
[26:07.200 --> 26:08.200]  I was telling my mom that.
[26:08.200 --> 26:12.120]  Just look, you want to beat the enemy, faulty on these murderers, they want to kill us all,
[26:12.120 --> 26:15.000]  but they got a special liken for black folks.
[26:15.000 --> 26:16.000]  They're killing them in Africa.
[26:16.000 --> 26:20.040]  And by the way, the black folks here, they know Gates is running operations in Africa.
[26:20.040 --> 26:25.000]  So you globals are in a lot of trouble, but it makes me sick, makes me physically ill
[26:25.000 --> 26:27.720]  to watch this unfold.
[26:27.720 --> 26:30.400]  Another thing is, it's a stick in the eye of the enemy to keep us on air.
[26:30.400 --> 26:31.400]  I need your financial support.
[26:31.400 --> 26:32.400]  I love you and I appreciate it.
[26:32.400 --> 26:36.520]  We got supplements you already need, vitamin mineral fusion, we got the fish oil that's
[26:36.520 --> 26:38.400]  got all the D3 and the rest of it.
[26:38.400 --> 26:40.760]  We've got the DNA force plus it's so good for your cells.
[26:40.760 --> 26:43.280]  You take it one product is that we have X2.
[26:43.280 --> 26:47.440]  The big sales got it in soon as the emergency stop lockdown to save the republic stop the
[26:47.440 --> 26:51.840]  steel cell and informerstore.com free shipping more, but it's got to end in a couple days.
[26:51.840 --> 26:54.840]  Informerstore.com will be right back.
[26:54.840 --> 26:59.040]  Remember Hillary Clinton, remember Pelosi, remember Bill Clinton, remember Obama, all
[26:59.040 --> 27:03.840]  of them said we are not going to concede if there's a red mirage.
[27:03.840 --> 27:07.360]  We believe it's going to look like Trump's going to win in the landslide because they
[27:07.360 --> 27:08.360]  had the internal polls.
[27:08.360 --> 27:12.440]  And indeed, Trump won most of the states he won last time by an even bigger margin.
[27:12.440 --> 27:18.200]  And when he was set to win the other ones, they froze these seven states on election
[27:18.200 --> 27:21.680]  night and then they brought in all of the reserve ballots they had.
[27:21.680 --> 27:22.680]  This is completely transparent.
[27:22.680 --> 27:25.760]  So when they say that he is president-elect, he's not.
[27:25.760 --> 27:29.080]  Trump has not conceded, none of the states have certified the vote and now all these
[27:29.080 --> 27:34.440]  investigations have been opened up and avalanches, mountains, oceans of election fraud has come
[27:34.440 --> 27:38.160]  out and already been documented in Georgia.
[27:38.160 --> 27:40.360]  Officials are on record saying we've already found fraud.
[27:40.360 --> 27:42.640]  So ladies and gentlemen, the fix is in.
[27:42.640 --> 27:46.600]  They've run bigger and bigger hoaxes every time because the last hoax failed.
[27:46.600 --> 27:48.520]  But now this is the mother of all hoaxes.
[27:48.520 --> 27:51.240]  And if they get away with this, it's the end of America as we know it.
[27:51.240 --> 27:54.880]  We will be Venezuela in full wars.com.
[27:54.880 --> 28:00.240]  There are many references in the Holy Bible to the mustard seed and why is that?
[28:00.240 --> 28:04.840]  It's one of the tiniest seeds out there, but a giant tree like bush grows from it that
[28:04.840 --> 28:08.400]  produces more mustard seeds.
[28:08.400 --> 28:12.520]  Mustard was known by the ancients around the world to have amazing health effects.
[28:12.520 --> 28:13.520]  They didn't know why.
[28:13.520 --> 28:18.680]  Well, with modern science, we know it's one of the purest, cleanest, organic forms of

[28:59.040 --> 29:01.520]  This is taken under the tongue.
[29:01.520 --> 29:03.680]  It is pure turmeric.
[29:03.680 --> 29:08.680]  It goes together very well with our body's ultimate turmeric formula that is taken as
[29:08.680 --> 29:13.040]  a powdered capsule and absorbed in the stomach and intestines.
[29:13.040 --> 29:17.200]  This is absorbed under the tongue into the bloodstream and then the remaining also is
[29:17.200 --> 29:21.360]  then absorbed by the stomach so it's more of an intense delivery system.
[29:21.360 --> 29:25.680]  The two formulas are different but both are concentrates and our first product got rave
[29:25.680 --> 29:26.680]  reviews.
[29:26.680 --> 29:28.640]  We've now been testing this out for several months.
[29:28.640 --> 29:32.120]  Some of our staff like it more than bodies, some like bodies better.
[29:32.120 --> 29:36.680]  For me, they're both amazing for their anti-inflammatory action and so much more and they fund the

[30:06.760 --> 30:12.880]  That grass bean is coming down.
[30:12.880 --> 30:14.880]  Waging war on corruption.
[30:14.880 --> 30:24.880]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[30:24.880 --> 30:32.880]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining me.
[30:32.880 --> 30:37.520]  I'm bringing you very, very grave information and I know a lot of people are listening now,
[30:37.520 --> 30:40.280]  a lot more people are tuning in, they're paying a lot of attention to us.
[30:40.280 --> 30:44.080]  That's why do we have to stay on air while they try to silence us the last few years.
[30:44.080 --> 30:48.160]  They were so scared of us because we had the blueprint of their takeover plan.
[30:48.160 --> 30:52.480]  That's why before they launched the COVID operation a year ago, they took in game off
[30:52.480 --> 30:57.040]  of Amazon and many other platforms and basically had the distributors were still selling in
[30:57.040 --> 31:03.840]  stores, stopped restocking the DVDs was also taken off many other player services because
[31:03.840 --> 31:09.280]  in the film, we lay out how the UN and others say we're going to bring in planetary government
[31:09.280 --> 31:15.760]  using a real virus or the threat of a virus and we know what COVID-19 is.
[31:15.760 --> 31:23.360]  If you go back to the H1N1 flu scare of almost a decade ago, it later came out in white papers
[31:23.360 --> 31:29.360]  by pharmaceutical companies a year after that a year before that they created a simulant
[31:29.360 --> 31:35.320]  flu virus that was a live flu virus, but they claimed wasn't harmful that they could put
[31:35.320 --> 31:42.560]  in the regular vaccine so that they could quote track the spread of it and track how
[31:42.560 --> 31:45.560]  flu spread that that really wasn't what was going on.
[31:45.560 --> 31:48.560]  They had jacked into the RNA of the virus.
[31:48.560 --> 31:51.880]  It had a lot of mutinogenic effects and cancer-causing effects.
[31:51.880 --> 31:55.400]  You looked that up and so that's what they're doing with the vaccines is the vaccines are
[31:55.400 --> 31:57.480]  a cover for the Trojan horses.
[31:57.480 --> 32:02.240]  They're putting in people just like, oh, black folks, we're going to give you a vaccine.
[32:02.240 --> 32:06.120]  That's really life syphilis, but again, when they started coming out, the only focus on
[32:06.120 --> 32:08.360]  the black folks and people say, oh, it's just the black folks.
[32:08.360 --> 32:12.720]  No, it's everybody that was poor, but they could target.
[32:12.720 --> 32:15.920]  So now there's a giant planetary operation.
[32:15.920 --> 32:17.560]  Bill Gates has been thrown out of India.
[32:17.560 --> 32:18.560]  He's been thrown out of Tanzania.
[32:18.560 --> 32:20.240]  He's been thrown out of Kenya.
[32:20.240 --> 32:24.080]  He's been thrown out of over 20 countries because they caught him giving people cancer
[32:24.080 --> 32:25.080]  viruses.
[32:25.080 --> 32:27.400]  They caught him giving people HIV.
[32:27.400 --> 32:32.120]  They caught him giving people polio and again, I'm on Joe Rogan three weeks ago.
[32:32.120 --> 32:38.240]  I go, Joe, AP reports that most of the polio cases are from the UN's own vaccine program
[32:38.240 --> 32:39.680]  paid for by Bill Gates.
[32:39.680 --> 32:40.680]  It's his specific vaccine.
[32:40.680 --> 32:43.280]  And Joe's like, there's no way that's true, man.
[32:43.280 --> 32:48.600]  Boom, pulls it right up because they don't even try to hide this now.
[32:48.600 --> 32:52.880]  So when you're tuning in, I want everybody to understand your life is over as you know
[32:52.880 --> 32:55.480]  it until you fight back.
[32:55.480 --> 32:59.680]  We need people every day surrounding the governor's mansion where Governor Abbott is.
[32:59.680 --> 33:02.280]  If he's in a restaurant eating, you don't go up and threatening.
[33:02.280 --> 33:05.480]  You go up and you say, sir, we know you're being blackmailed.
[33:05.480 --> 33:06.760]  We know the lockdown is permanent.
[33:06.760 --> 33:07.760]  Be a leader and stop it.
[33:07.760 --> 33:09.400]  We need to start his recall.
[33:09.400 --> 33:10.400]  Okay.
[33:10.400 --> 33:15.080]  We need to see more state Supreme Courts and federal courts throw this out and say, no,
[33:15.080 --> 33:17.400]  I know so many of you are in love with Amy Comey Barrett.
[33:17.400 --> 33:18.400]  I hope she's good.
[33:18.400 --> 33:22.120]  I hope she votes for Trump against the Supreme Court, but she's for lockdown.
[33:22.120 --> 33:23.680]  She's for far, for stipulations.
[33:23.680 --> 33:27.640]  She supported the 1901 court case.
[33:27.640 --> 33:32.560]  That governor, Tony Evers, furious about Wisconsin Supreme Court, tosses out his latest COVID
[33:32.560 --> 33:34.200]  stay at home order.
[33:34.200 --> 33:35.640]  That's what we need.
[33:35.640 --> 33:41.520]  But if we keep complying, if we keep rolling over, it's successive approximation of basic
[33:41.520 --> 33:44.160]  psychological operation.
[33:44.160 --> 33:47.760]  Now obviously we all know this is listeners.
[33:47.760 --> 33:49.280]  We've got to get it out to others.
[33:49.280 --> 33:53.120]  We can look at it and tell it's an incremental fish trap.
[33:53.120 --> 33:58.440]  We know those fish traps where the hole looks like it's only so big, but once the fish gets
[33:58.440 --> 34:02.360]  in, has a tendency to swim forward, and then it squeezes through, but won't go back through
[34:02.360 --> 34:06.520]  a hole that it sees as too small, it'll squeeze through it once it thinks it's trapped and
[34:06.520 --> 34:07.520]  actually get trapped.
[34:07.520 --> 34:10.880]  But when it turns around and try to leave, the hole's smaller, so even though it can
[34:10.880 --> 34:15.040]  still squeeze through, almost no species of fish will squeeze through.
[34:15.040 --> 34:19.120]  The globalists have studied us like fish, and they've had Stanford, they've had Yale,
[34:19.120 --> 34:22.960]  they've had Harvard, they've had Oxford, they've had Cambridge, all put out in the last year
[34:22.960 --> 34:26.520]  that years ago they did studies on how to make you accept lockdowns, how to make you
[34:26.520 --> 34:31.760]  accept forced inoculations, how to make you accept your children being taken from you.
[34:31.760 --> 34:33.400]  But that's just the takeover.
[34:33.400 --> 34:38.360]  Then they break the economy, put everyone on a universal income, and control every step
[34:38.360 --> 34:42.160]  of your life for that universal income you get, and now they have that giant mass of
[34:42.160 --> 34:46.000]  people that'll do whatever they're told for that universal income, and you are slaves.
[34:46.000 --> 34:48.280]  The chains are on.
[34:48.280 --> 34:52.880]  This is a systematic, illegal program, and I don't want any offensive violence, but I
[34:52.880 --> 34:56.560]  see a lot of talk online, people saying time to dust off the muskets.
[34:56.560 --> 35:02.040]  Here's the issue, existentially, and I'll give you these clips of the big news.
[35:02.040 --> 35:10.560]  Under common law, under common sense, you cannot come with experimental, dangerous vaccines,
[35:10.560 --> 35:14.760]  whether they be safe or not, and they're not, they're deadly, and it's obviously the takeover.
[35:14.760 --> 35:17.720]  These people have liability protection, they have long histories of killing people with
[35:17.720 --> 35:20.080]  vaccines, they are eugenicists that want to depopulate you.
[35:20.080 --> 35:24.000]  When somebody says, I want to depopulate you, and he's spent hundreds of billions of dollars
[35:24.000 --> 35:27.800]  he got from big foundations, and the robber barons to get control of the world health
[35:27.800 --> 35:32.120]  system, and most nation-state systems, he's been thrown out of over 20 countries, Gates
[35:32.120 --> 35:36.120]  Hasby's, he's in another 140 or so.
[35:36.120 --> 35:40.960]  When you've got something of that magnitude going down, and he says he wants to do this,
[35:40.960 --> 35:45.840]  and it's what he comes out of, Cold Springs Harbor, and the eugenics, and then he's coming
[35:45.840 --> 35:51.480]  violating the Geneva Convention, violating the Nuremberg Code, violating international
[35:51.480 --> 35:56.440]  law, if the Nazis were coming to give you a deadly shot or take your kids away, you
[35:56.440 --> 35:59.320]  don't just have a right, you have a duty to fight them.
[35:59.320 --> 36:01.920]  So they've already shut down the communications almost everywhere.
[36:01.920 --> 36:06.720]  Now they're coming, now they're going to beta test in Canada, and Europe in this round,
[36:06.720 --> 36:10.200]  and in California and in New York, dragging people out of their homes, beating people
[36:10.200 --> 36:13.800]  up that don't wear a mask, taking people's children away, the UN said that was the goal,
[36:13.800 --> 36:18.560]  it's already happened in Australia and Spain, now it's happening in England, and there's
[36:18.560 --> 36:23.600]  this normalizing that vans come, cops have guns, you disappear, and then again, if they
[36:23.600 --> 36:28.720]  say you have COVID, these are leftist doctors at extermination centers, not guillotines,
[36:28.720 --> 36:32.720]  they say, oh, he had COVID, and now you're going to see people take it to the COVID centers,
[36:32.720 --> 36:36.880]  it's already happening in Australia, people die in these, you're totally healthy, they
[36:36.880 --> 36:41.280]  take you, they go, oh, he got sick, we had to innovate him, and yeah, he died after two
[36:41.280 --> 36:42.280]  weeks on a ventilator.
[36:42.280 --> 36:47.960]  So they strap you down, and the Communist Chinese do this, and they put it down your
[36:47.960 --> 36:52.200]  lungs, and they kill you, and they sit there and laugh at you while you're dying, and they
[36:52.200 --> 36:53.200]  turn it up way higher.
[36:53.200 --> 36:57.120]  In fact, a lot of the old folks in the blue city areas where they have these killer eugenics
[36:57.120 --> 37:02.240]  doctors, they're in cult bioethics boards like Ezekiel Emanuel, saying he wants to kill
[37:02.240 --> 37:09.080]  old people, he runs this, he hires for decades all these boards, these are psycho killers,
[37:09.080 --> 37:13.720]  and even the medical association said, why did you give people twice the pressure you're
[37:13.720 --> 37:19.280]  supposed to, and they're just like, because they got to get kill numbers.
[37:19.280 --> 37:25.160]  So they're coming to kill you, they're coming to kill you, they're coming to kill you, and
[37:25.160 --> 37:29.480]  then they're like, oh, see death numbers, they're already beta tested in the nursing
[37:29.480 --> 37:33.600]  homes, they already wouldn't let families in, oh, you might have COVID, but if you have
[37:33.600 --> 37:38.280]  COVID, but we're healthy, asymptomatic, oh, we're going to bring you in to the nursing
[37:38.280 --> 37:42.560]  home where there's no sunlight, and they eat crappy food to get half the death numbers
[37:42.560 --> 37:43.560]  in the country.
[37:43.560 --> 37:48.080]  So they're going to kill the old people, that's what COVID-19 is, that's why Ezekiel Emanuel
[37:48.080 --> 37:54.320]  is going to run the whole new system for Biden if he gets in, and that's why he's announcing.
[37:54.320 --> 37:57.280]  Black folks, you want your welfare, you're going to take it.
[37:57.280 --> 38:00.600]  Poor white folks, poor black folks, you're going to take it.
[38:00.600 --> 38:06.920]  Old people, you can't come see your kids, kids can't come see you, they've already said we're
[38:06.920 --> 38:10.920]  going to ship more people in and kill them, and it's all a test to see if they can get
[38:10.920 --> 38:16.240]  away with not with guillotines, if they got guillotines out, you'd know you'd resist.
[38:16.240 --> 38:20.520]  They had guillotines in downtown D.C., chopping Trump's head off tomorrow, and chopping his
[38:20.520 --> 38:25.480]  family's head off, you'd rise up, we'd overthrown, but it's not that, it's, oh, we're taking
[38:25.480 --> 38:31.120]  you to an emergency COVID center, and when you get to the emergency COVID center, you
[38:31.120 --> 38:35.160]  just disappear, and we already know there's been operating for six months in Canada, and
[38:35.160 --> 38:40.400]  the number of death statistics they're holding, but we know that the main deaths are happening
[38:40.400 --> 38:47.040]  in these centers, and they're beta testing on old people and on homeless who are rundown.
[38:47.040 --> 38:50.040]  So at first, you get the cops used to it, well, we take them to the center, they don't
[38:50.040 --> 38:54.160]  have any new process, no one knows who they are, they take them, and then they have special
[38:54.160 --> 38:58.240]  doctors that believe they're saving the earth, humans are bad, they're being paid money to
[38:58.240 --> 39:03.080]  do it, $3,000 extra here in the U.S., they're paid extra in Canada, these are very high
[39:03.080 --> 39:08.800]  paid doctors, just like the organ harvesting doctors that keep baby comfortable, he says,
[39:08.800 --> 39:14.240]  mama doesn't want baby, we keep baby comfortable, we harvest organs, Governor Northam, and he's
[39:14.240 --> 39:19.360]  a baby harvester, and he's up there telling you, listen, police don't need to be involved,
[39:19.360 --> 39:23.520]  husband doesn't need to be involved, only the woman and the doctors, there should be
[39:23.520 --> 39:28.520]  at least two doctors in the room, and we agree to say baby's not resuscitated, now babies
[39:28.520 --> 39:33.320]  are alive, resuscitation means we don't say you're a viable life under eugenics, under
[39:33.320 --> 39:38.200]  bioethics, then baby is taken and kept a week, two weeks, whatever, while they blood type
[39:38.200 --> 39:42.680]  it, get the organs ready for harvesting, and we're going to harvest baby, they're going
[39:42.680 --> 39:47.240]  to harvest you, so that's why we have the second vote to defend ourselves, but this
[39:47.240 --> 39:52.360]  is it, they're coming for you and your family, they will murder you, they've got brainwashed
[39:52.360 --> 39:55.400]  nurses who don't even know what plans they have, something very sad is happening, it's
[39:55.400 --> 39:59.160]  very sad because it was all avoidable, two and a half years ago when info wars got banned
[39:59.160 --> 40:04.840]  off of more than 60 major platforms, I warned everybody that was a precedent for the upcoming
[40:04.840 --> 40:09.840]  presidential election and that they would continue to ratchet down and tighten down
[40:09.840 --> 40:15.800]  the censorship until effectively there was a total internet kill switch in place against
[40:15.800 --> 40:19.920]  conservatives, nationals, and populace, and now that's happened, and then I told everybody
[40:19.920 --> 40:24.200]  that they would then start moving to arrest individuals that demonstrate and protest using
[40:24.200 --> 40:29.880]  a second COVID-19 lockdown, and that Trump needed to get out front and fully repudiate
[40:29.880 --> 40:35.080]  COVID-19 is basically an overblown hoax, he started to do that in the last few months
[40:35.080 --> 40:39.120]  of the campaign, but we have to understand that that's the pincer attack they're going
[40:39.120 --> 40:43.560]  to use, they're going to use black lives matter and race war to start up the American people
[40:43.560 --> 40:47.320]  and divide us, and they're going to use economic warfare shutting down the economy to try to
[40:47.320 --> 40:52.280]  control us, I hope people will listen now to my warnings because I'm on air, tell them
[40:52.280 --> 40:56.240]  what's coming next. The problem with social Darwinism is the
[40:56.240 --> 41:03.640]  so-called elites, the most cunning, smart, inventive people believe that chivalry doesn't
[41:03.640 --> 41:07.560]  exist anymore, they don't believe in being aristocrats, trying to hold up civilization
[41:07.560 --> 41:13.120]  and power the people, and once the establishment has that predatory idea, civilization collapses
[41:13.120 --> 41:17.400]  very, very quickly, you can't treat the least of us like garbage and not treat your own
[41:17.400 --> 41:22.880]  family like that, and so it is this lack of empathy that's going to destroy us.
[41:22.880 --> 41:27.600]  The globalists can try to be heartless devil worshipers that commit rituals of all sorts
[41:27.600 --> 41:31.600]  of horrible crimes, try to get away from a humanity, but really they can't escape the
[41:31.600 --> 41:37.280]  laws of the universe, they may train themselves to commit heinous crimes and not feel it themselves,
[41:37.280 --> 41:41.280]  but the repercussions of what they commit always comes back on them and their families
[41:41.280 --> 41:46.680]  and the very structure itself, wealth is created by loving God, wealth is created by having
[41:46.680 --> 41:50.840]  the connection with God. God is the source of all creation, all success, all power.
[41:50.840 --> 42:20.680]  We deny that, you'll be destroyed.
[42:20.680 --> 42:31.680]  God is the source of all creation, wealth is created by loving God, wealth is created
[42:31.680 --> 42:43.680]  by having the connection with God, wealth is created by having the connection with God,
[42:43.680 --> 43:03.600]  wealth is created by having the connection with God, wealth is created by having the
[43:03.600 --> 43:10.200]  Biden is not president-elect. Well on its face he's not president-elect because
[43:10.200 --> 43:16.240]  the votes have not been certified by any of the 50 states and counting is still
[43:16.240 --> 43:22.000]  going on what in seven of the states and Trump is gaining ground in all but one
[43:22.000 --> 43:26.800]  of them and then there's also going to be recounts audits and all the spot checks
[43:26.800 --> 43:32.160]  have already shown massive fraud but in comes the ace card the ace of spades
[43:32.160 --> 43:36.080]  big tech censorship is blocking not just the president not just members of
[43:36.080 --> 43:40.280]  Congress but tens of millions of Americans from even sharing local
[43:40.280 --> 43:44.680]  news stations confirming the fraud this is a foreign-backed multinational take
[43:44.680 --> 43:50.000]  over the United States. Trump is battling a Chinese-backed new world order system
[43:50.000 --> 43:55.440]  bit on keeping us locked down forever in an economic war and bringing us to our knees.
[43:55.440 --> 44:19.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're
[44:19.320 --> 44:26.720]  listening to the Alex Jones show all right I want to be deadly straight with
[44:26.720 --> 44:31.200]  you at absolutely level with you a trillion percent okay I am not
[44:31.200 --> 44:35.960]  exaggerating about any of this I know it sounds completely insane what I'm
[44:35.960 --> 44:41.840]  saying I can prove every point of this in their own admissions their own
[44:41.840 --> 44:47.040]  statements their own preparation but now we're ten months into this global
[44:47.040 --> 44:53.680]  government martial law medical tyranny fear machine takeover and you've got
[44:53.680 --> 44:58.680]  arch bishops saying it's a planetary new world order satanic takeover to kill
[44:58.680 --> 45:02.040]  you and your family and shut down the economy and start a third world it's
[45:02.040 --> 45:06.480]  top scientist it's thousands of prominent virologists doctors scientists
[45:06.480 --> 45:12.240]  it's only clear when I say that they have medical boards and special hospitals
[45:12.240 --> 45:17.280]  trained by Z kill a manual and others this is on record okay my dad used to
[45:17.280 --> 45:20.840]  own a hospital my dad managed 200 dental offices at one time my dad's
[45:20.840 --> 45:24.680]  testified the state legislature okay and so I grew up around medical
[45:24.680 --> 45:29.800]  management all right and my dad told me he goes there's certain hospitals in
[45:29.800 --> 45:34.360]  Dallas where they kill people and take their organs now when I was 16 get my
[45:34.360 --> 45:37.680]  driver's license he said don't sign the organ donor card there's certain
[45:37.680 --> 45:40.960]  hospitals in Dallas kill people I just thought he was crazy but I still didn't
[45:40.960 --> 45:45.960]  sign it again a few years later 60 minutes back when did a good job talked
[45:45.960 --> 45:52.800]  about Dallas and Chicago two specific cities also Austin killing people that
[45:52.800 --> 45:58.240]  were could be saved for their organs so it's certain hospitals like anything
[45:58.240 --> 46:01.200]  it's good and evil like you go to one Catholic church it's good people go to
[46:01.200 --> 46:04.520]  another it's run by child molesters you go to one Baptist church is run by good
[46:04.520 --> 46:10.280]  people go to another it's run by devil worshipers it's everything isn't what
[46:10.280 --> 46:14.720]  it seems when so doctors are great people on average like Dr. Ron Paul and
[46:14.720 --> 46:17.960]  so many others and they have the Hippocratic oath but people like
[46:17.960 --> 46:21.360]  Northum and people like Ezekiel have trained and created these bioethics
[46:21.360 --> 46:25.200]  boards and they've gotten lost chains in New York in places where they can kill
[46:25.200 --> 46:29.680]  already born babies that are healthy now why do they want that they don't want
[46:29.680 --> 46:38.280]  just the babies they want you so the UN with their director of global crisis
[46:38.280 --> 46:45.400]  response we've played the clip up a bunch here he said years ago when the
[46:45.400 --> 46:49.040]  global pandemic hits and it's coming so did Fauci he said we'll deal with Trump
[46:49.040 --> 46:53.000]  there's a little pandemic coming Trump didn't see that speech because it's
[46:53.000 --> 46:56.680]  Fauci was already there people like why does Trump have Fauci it's the whole
[46:56.680 --> 47:01.640]  bureaucracy Fauci involved covering up what age really was what happened in
[47:01.640 --> 47:05.960]  Africa he's been involved in all of it he's he's been around longer than gates
[47:05.960 --> 47:12.280]  in this so if Gates is Darth Vader he's Palpatine okay so here's what I'm
[47:12.280 --> 47:17.800]  getting at the UN recommended emergency centers be set up as prisons with
[47:17.800 --> 47:22.600]  special doctors and special staff for people that refuse to be tested or
[47:22.600 --> 47:28.200]  quarantine so like they've got special hospitals and special facilities like in
[47:28.200 --> 47:30.880]  New York they have one hospital where more people died there than everywhere
[47:30.880 --> 47:34.360]  else in New York because they're that's where they're running the op they're
[47:34.360 --> 47:37.840]  getting fifty three thousand dollars everybody they killed I'm sorry there's
[47:37.840 --> 47:41.680]  two thousand extra you get so it's fifty four thousand and change for one
[47:41.680 --> 47:46.560]  they kill sorry it's a little bit extra so this is real this is happening this is
[47:46.560 --> 47:51.440]  for money at the low level but creating these cadre cores of killers
[47:51.440 --> 47:58.160]  assassins they can then expand those cadre cords out and so the new system
[47:58.160 --> 48:03.880]  is not death by a firing squad need to create a meme it's not firing squads it's
[48:03.880 --> 48:12.040]  not guillotines they don't hang you they take you and they intubate you because
[48:12.040 --> 48:16.040]  that's the UN recommendation if you have COVID we stick a thing down your
[48:16.040 --> 48:22.200]  throat down your airways into your bronchia and that's how they murder you
[48:22.200 --> 48:26.640]  that's the fast murder way the slow murder is the vaccine which is why you
[48:26.640 --> 48:29.040]  see the cancer rates up and all the death all the disease all the
[48:29.040 --> 48:34.080]  logical problems and that's all the studies so in Africa in places they just
[48:34.080 --> 48:37.920]  come in and pay the village leaders to let us shoot up people will give you a
[48:37.920 --> 48:41.640]  half million dollars and the village leaders will send out machine guns and
[48:41.640 --> 48:44.680]  make a thousand people take it and then like hundreds die the next day you know
[48:44.680 --> 48:48.520]  miscarriages total death it comes out of local news well now the villagers when
[48:48.520 --> 48:53.680]  they see you in trucks they just run and they fight and so the Africans now fight
[48:53.680 --> 48:56.520]  for their lives and they're having trouble so now Bill Gates announced
[48:56.520 --> 49:02.120]  they're gonna start shipping in free food food aid that has live virus vaccine in
[49:02.120 --> 49:09.840]  the food so everything being done to the Africans is now time for us so when I
[49:09.840 --> 49:14.160]  tell you all of this I want you to know we're not making this up okay I'm sorry
[49:14.160 --> 49:17.480]  it's this horrible so it's special hospitals they're gonna take political
[49:17.480 --> 49:21.000]  people they want oh you went this restaurant gave us your QR code or you
[49:21.000 --> 49:25.160]  know gave us your it's someone else in their head that then they come and say
[49:25.160 --> 49:29.320]  sorry we need to test you oh who says you're positive it's all fake and they
[49:29.320 --> 49:35.680]  go we need you to come with us now see in phase one that we run it was just stay
[49:35.680 --> 49:39.120]  locked down it's up to you everybody's kind of scared we did ourselves then
[49:39.120 --> 49:41.240]  phase two is what you already saw in Australia they've been already done
[49:41.240 --> 49:45.600]  phase two in Spain where they come and threaten you your neighbor sees you out
[49:45.600 --> 49:48.920]  they get money you get taken away the facility phase three they're gonna go
[49:48.920 --> 49:53.080]  sorry we just can't allow that we're just creating a computer list of those
[49:53.080 --> 49:57.000]  that we think are dissenting against the lockdown and that's the reason millions
[49:57.000 --> 49:59.960]  died of COVID when they're really just gonna be killing you with ventilators so
[49:59.960 --> 50:03.760]  that's why they're still going we need ventilators than the New York mayor the
[50:03.760 --> 50:09.080]  New York governor because that's the murder weapon and again the UN is the
[50:09.080 --> 50:13.080]  boss they say hi hi how to turn the air up they say who to do it to they say no
[50:13.080 --> 50:17.200]  family allowed in to the hospital or the nursing home so they can kill you so
[50:17.200 --> 50:23.240]  they already made in the US the nursing homes the FEMA centers as a beta test now
[50:23.240 --> 50:26.040]  they're just gonna move directly to FEMA centers so let's go ahead and go back
[50:26.040 --> 50:30.480]  to October next hour I'm gonna lay out the latest info how to stop it what we've
[50:30.480 --> 50:38.120]  got to do but this is a Matt Hillier out of Kingston Canada member of
[50:38.120 --> 50:43.440]  Parliament back in October 14th talking about what was coming now it's here and
[50:43.440 --> 50:47.640]  again they're just now going to step two we're not going to step two yet but we
[50:47.640 --> 50:51.240]  will this is all a laid-out plan here it is
[50:51.240 --> 50:57.400]  thank you speaker my question is to the Premier in my supplemental question
[50:57.400 --> 51:00.960]  yesterday I asked this government if the people of Ontario should prepare for
[51:00.960 --> 51:05.800]  internment camps in September the federal government posted a call for
[51:05.800 --> 51:10.520]  expressions of interest for contractors to supply provide and manage
[51:10.520 --> 51:16.240]  quarantine isolation camps throughout every province and every territory in
[51:16.240 --> 51:24.000]  Canada these quarantine isolation camps however are not limited to people with
[51:24.000 --> 51:31.600]  COVID but provide a wide latitude for many people to be detained surely this
[51:31.600 --> 51:36.480]  government is aware of the intentions to build these isolation camps from coast
[51:36.480 --> 51:41.480]  to coast and my question to the Premier is how many of these camps will be built
[51:41.480 --> 51:46.160]  and how many people does this government expect to do question
[51:46.160 --> 51:51.680]  government house leader thank you thank you mr. Speaker it is very true that
[51:51.680 --> 51:55.560]  when people leave the country and when they come back in that the the province
[51:55.560 --> 51:58.320]  is suggesting and in the federal government cooperation with federal
[51:58.320 --> 52:02.440]  government we're suggesting that people isolate themselves that has been a
[52:02.440 --> 52:05.520]  practice that has been very successful not only here in the province of Ontario
[52:05.520 --> 52:11.600]  but across across Canada and we will we're gonna go through the actual
[52:11.600 --> 52:16.600]  documents when we start the next hour but here it is in French out of Quebec
[52:16.600 --> 52:20.320]  City breaking Canada forcefully removes and in prisons this is months ago
[52:20.320 --> 52:25.560]  uncooperative coronavirus positive citizens at secret location then we have
[52:25.560 --> 52:31.800]  videos of people that criticize the lockdown in their homes and the police
[52:31.800 --> 52:35.400]  come and say you're not allowed to criticize the lockdown and arrest them
[52:35.400 --> 52:38.280]  and disappear them and by the way a lot of these people we try to get a
[52:38.280 --> 52:43.600]  Mondaria remember that what Swedish couple was panicking and they come
[52:43.600 --> 52:47.320]  and she was organizing a demonstration and they arrested her husband they
[52:47.320 --> 52:51.000]  never been seen again last time I heard we need to check on them same thing in
[52:51.000 --> 52:54.600]  Australia they've disappeared thousands of people members of city councils that
[52:54.600 --> 52:59.960]  said no we're taking a military basis some were never seen again and see that's
[52:59.960 --> 53:03.720]  the thing we're used to being free in the US or Australia or the UK to a
[53:03.720 --> 53:07.200]  certain extent we're all told you know it's cops killing black people that's
[53:07.200 --> 53:11.640]  the big problem with police no it's leftist bureaucrats that are going out
[53:11.640 --> 53:15.080]  and grabbing everyone and now they're saying you can't go to a concert you
[53:15.080 --> 53:18.000]  can't go to school unless you've had all the vaccines you've got to have a
[53:18.000 --> 53:21.880]  government-issued phone just like they have at the universities now in the US
[53:21.880 --> 53:27.720]  that says you've got your digital passport which also tracks you and again
[53:27.720 --> 53:31.160]  all that's just the police state takeover and the precedent of them being
[53:31.160 --> 53:35.920]  able to disappear anybody they want under UN command that's the real issue is
[53:35.920 --> 53:40.760]  UN command world government the first world collapses third world dies and
[53:40.760 --> 53:45.200]  the Davos group says in the great reset in his book and in their own statements
[53:45.200 --> 53:48.320]  go look it up we've showed you videos we show you the articles they say the
[53:48.320 --> 53:54.400]  third world is gonna collapse because of COVID no it's the COVID lockdown hundreds
[53:54.400 --> 53:57.040]  of millions are gonna starve to death and they're gonna flood us and we've got
[53:57.040 --> 54:00.240]  to feed them now but they're not really gonna feed them they're just gonna
[54:00.240 --> 54:06.160]  bring in they said 600 million people in the next 20 years the US because of
[54:06.160 --> 54:11.800]  COVID 250 million into France alone France isn't even 100 million people did
[54:11.800 --> 54:17.640]  you just hear what I said this is dystopia hell like you've never imagined
[54:17.640 --> 54:23.840]  I'm explaining again that trap just snapped shut okay and I'm not trying to
[54:23.840 --> 54:27.240]  scare you here you're gonna see all this happen they're gonna murder your
[54:27.240 --> 54:31.000]  neighbors with those damn ventilators they're gonna murder you if they can
[54:31.000 --> 54:34.560]  and they're gonna have ignorant people around them going just the science the
[54:34.560 --> 54:39.360]  cops like well I take you we got to get in their faces now lay it out before
[54:39.360 --> 54:44.560]  they roll out the next mode that's our secret weapon when President Trump said
[54:44.560 --> 54:47.600]  that the mainstream corporate media was the enemy of America he really was
[54:47.600 --> 54:50.840]  telling the truth they don't just work for the communist Chinese and the
[54:50.840 --> 54:55.280]  globalist the EU and the whole Hollywood America hating God-hating crew they
[54:55.280 --> 55:00.680]  literally say that they are in control of our minds and believe they do own us
[55:00.680 --> 55:04.800]  and tell us who the president is even though that's not in law and they're
[55:04.800 --> 55:08.040]  just gaslighting the whole public over and over again saying Joe Biden's
[55:08.040 --> 55:13.000]  president-elect repeating it over and over young a brainwashing mantra when
[55:13.000 --> 55:16.400]  it's up again to the state government to certify those votes most votes for
[55:16.400 --> 55:19.480]  being challenged there's massive evidence of fraud again this is so
[55:19.480 --> 55:24.120]  incredibly clear Biden said because he thought he was gonna lose up front that
[55:24.120 --> 55:28.080]  oh we're gonna challenge the vote no matter what until every votes counted
[55:28.080 --> 55:31.160]  well a lot of those have been counted and there's massive fraud being
[55:31.160 --> 55:34.360]  discovered so we're gonna hold the course here because Joe Biden is a
[55:34.360 --> 55:37.760]  communist Chinese agent he's a globalist he wants carbon taxes he will
[55:37.760 --> 55:41.520]  destroy this country by design to consolidate power and take control of
[55:41.520 --> 55:44.240]  us this is war
[55:44.240 --> 55:48.560]  communist China has been fully open for business for more than six months but the
[55:48.560 --> 55:52.480]  European Union and every other major Western nation is still under some form
[55:52.480 --> 55:56.360]  of lockdown and the lockdowns are getting more intense and people are being
[55:56.360 --> 55:59.520]  told they're gonna be arrested and they leave their houses just like we've seen
[55:59.520 --> 56:05.320]  in Australia you see the authoritarians want total control and because they
[56:05.320 --> 56:09.360]  don't respect this because the general public puts up with so much abuse they're
[56:09.360 --> 56:13.520]  going for broke why shouldn't they they never get in trouble for the big illegal
[56:13.520 --> 56:17.640]  wars never get in trouble the Chinese slave camps and ever get in trouble for
[56:17.640 --> 56:21.600]  all the terrible exploitation in Africa they never get in trouble for shipping
[56:21.600 --> 56:26.120]  and all other deadly drugs into our country and so why shouldn't they go
[56:26.120 --> 56:30.040]  for broke because so many people are domesticated and they're soft and they
[56:30.040 --> 56:34.160]  have Stockholm syndrome they love their abusers they can't believe they're being
[56:34.160 --> 56:38.200]  lied to they can't believe they're being conned and so they're going into
[56:38.200 --> 56:42.400]  bondage you see there's always a minority that says no and in fours is that
[56:42.400 --> 56:44.880]  minority
[56:44.880 --> 56:52.560]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[57:02.560 --> 57:09.520]  there are a further 135 million people facing crisis levels of hunger or worse
[57:09.520 --> 57:15.440]  that means 135 million people on earth are marching toward the brink of
[57:15.440 --> 57:22.120]  starvation an additional 130 million people could be pushed to the brink of
[57:22.120 --> 57:29.800]  starvation by the end of 2020 that's a total of 265 million people our analysis
[57:29.800 --> 57:35.360]  shows that 300,000 people could starve to death every single day over a three
[57:35.360 --> 57:41.840]  month three months period so that was six months ago that's David Beasley head of
[57:41.840 --> 57:45.400]  the UN food program I don't just believe the UN I've looked at the numbers
[57:45.400 --> 57:47.960]  there's probably more people starving to death because they don't call it
[57:47.960 --> 57:51.920]  starvation unless it's on a toe tag if you it's malnutrition you just die of
[57:51.920 --> 57:56.040]  the first virus comes along because of malnutrition just like so many Americans
[57:56.040 --> 57:59.800]  are obese but they're not getting the right nutrition I mean I'm not perfect
[57:59.800 --> 58:02.720]  either I eat like a pig at least I supplement on top of it so I don't get
[58:02.720 --> 58:06.960]  sick hardly ever I got a lot of stamina and libido but again they know what
[58:06.960 --> 58:11.800]  they're doing here's Richard Ryan head of the UN global emergency disease
[58:11.800 --> 58:15.720]  response saying we're coming in your houses to take you out while they started
[58:15.720 --> 58:21.880]  doing it in Spain in Australia everywhere they got people in line in key
[58:21.880 --> 58:28.040]  cities controlled by leftists and they say that in this labor party secret
[58:28.040 --> 58:31.800]  document that leaked six months ago that's now confirmed everything in that
[58:31.800 --> 58:37.400]  document they now admit is real they had hearings in parliament in Ottawa
[58:37.400 --> 58:42.000]  admitting that it's all a takeover it's a political operation it's so damn
[58:42.000 --> 58:46.480]  criminal just like they're still in the election here's what this monster Ryan
[58:46.480 --> 58:52.240]  had to say and at the moment in most parts of the world due to lockdown most
[58:52.240 --> 58:55.440]  of the transmission that's actually happening in many countries now is
[58:55.440 --> 59:00.600]  happening in the household at family level in some senses transmission has
[59:00.600 --> 59:06.560]  been taken off the streets and pushed back into family units now we need to
[59:06.560 --> 59:11.480]  go and look in families to find those people who may be sick and remove them
[59:11.480 --> 59:17.960]  and isolate them in a safe and dignified manner oh just like you keep the
[59:17.960 --> 59:22.560]  baby comfortable when you harvest its organs in a safe and dignified manner
[59:22.560 --> 59:26.680]  oh it's like a CIA would say we torture people in a very safe and dignified
[59:26.680 --> 59:32.240]  manner it's very professional this is all sycophantic bureaucrats and their
[59:32.240 --> 59:37.040]  takeover and Klaus Schwab admits running all this from the Davos group that
[59:37.040 --> 59:41.240]  COVID's just the cover Bill Gates says COVID's just a drill we're bringing in
[59:41.240 --> 59:45.920]  the New World Order we're cutting your carbon and they're doing it all now this
[59:45.920 --> 59:53.440]  is short segment we come back I'm gonna get to a doctor Dr. Batar who again this
[59:53.440 --> 59:57.840]  video goes viral people ask is this real and I saw this and remembered in the
[59:57.840 --> 1:00:02.600]  last eight months we saw this build up it's ten months now and I'm like yeah
[1:00:02.600 --> 1:00:07.440]  of course it's real but see that's the thing is Joseph Goebbels I've read some
[1:00:07.440 --> 1:00:13.240]  of his writings the Nazi propaganda's he said don't make your propaganda too
[1:00:13.240 --> 1:00:17.800]  complex don't get into the fine minutiae because that's trains people to think
[1:00:17.800 --> 1:00:23.040]  complex you want to dumb them down with a propaganda and make it real simple and
[1:00:23.040 --> 1:00:27.120]  so you want to speak to their laziness and just say oh don't worry about it
[1:00:27.120 --> 1:00:30.840]  it's not going on that's probably not real and that's the attitude when I'm
[1:00:30.840 --> 1:00:33.720]  like hey you know Bill Gates ran the wheel on lab with Fauci and all the bird
[1:00:33.720 --> 1:00:38.280]  flew gain a function bat coronavirus research you know here it came out five
[1:00:38.280 --> 1:00:41.120]  years ago they said it was really dangerous and then China ran the cover
[1:00:41.120 --> 1:00:44.680]  up with them and the China had mentions a weapon and it's gained a function so it
[1:00:44.680 --> 1:00:48.040]  never goes away and it always reinfects so we're always guilty forever we're
[1:00:48.040 --> 1:00:51.840]  always fighting an enemy that can't be defeated people just go dude nobody
[1:00:51.840 --> 1:00:57.040]  knows this stuff stop acting like you're smart I'm like I'm not acting like I'm
[1:00:57.040 --> 1:01:02.640]  smart these are enemies I've studied our enemy I know what they're doing I know
[1:01:02.640 --> 1:01:06.880]  what's coming next and now think to you the listeners I'm gonna thank you so

[1:01:11.600 --> 1:01:16.760]  and now our listeners are just skyrocketing which which is dangerous
[1:01:16.760 --> 1:01:21.120]  for me but I'm I'm I'm here to take my licks I'm in Jesus Christ hands so I'm
[1:01:21.120 --> 1:01:24.120]  not up or going all my shows big I want to be the biggest that's not I want to
[1:01:24.120 --> 1:01:28.800]  I want to go live on a farm I'm sick of this but I got a fight and I just want

[1:03:42.240 --> 1:03:47.800]  doing so that's all coming up here is a video from six months ago and now
[1:03:47.800 --> 1:03:53.240]  they're doing it people criticizing the lockdown in Australia in Canada are now
[1:03:53.240 --> 1:03:59.640]  being arrested and taken to secret facilities and disappearing and the
[1:03:59.640 --> 1:04:03.320]  liberals are like that's good kill fascist to see you tell a leftist hey
[1:04:03.320 --> 1:04:09.200]  lockdowns are fighting Nazis oh good your country existing is Nazi oh get
[1:04:09.200 --> 1:04:13.880]  rid of my country this these people are so sick but they're millennials and
[1:04:13.880 --> 1:04:16.760]  others that have been given everything and they just want to be on the winning
[1:04:16.760 --> 1:04:21.600]  team they're not on the winning team so again I am your host Alex Jones on this
[1:04:21.600 --> 1:04:26.960]  live Friday edition if you pull up the headline of the live show today it says
[1:04:26.960 --> 1:04:32.400]  it all and the magnitude of this is just totally unspeakable they are now
[1:04:32.400 --> 1:04:38.240]  officially rolling this system out with the AI surveillance grid with all of it
[1:04:38.240 --> 1:04:43.560]  to enforce this societal takeover that causes a global societal collapse and
[1:04:43.560 --> 1:04:48.680]  then they will reorganize society with a universal income that makes you a
[1:04:48.680 --> 1:04:54.400]  slave a slave in the bottom of a slave ship coming over from Africa or in the
[1:04:54.400 --> 1:04:59.440]  back of a wagon out of Germany into Rome thousands years ago was given food to
[1:04:59.440 --> 1:05:05.200]  keep the slave alive but you are not free and so they admit that's what this is
[1:05:05.200 --> 1:05:09.120]  and they say is to get you ready for sterilization and they're gonna give you
[1:05:09.120 --> 1:05:14.120]  vaccines that sterilize you bare minimum and then also give you cancer the way it
[1:05:14.120 --> 1:05:19.320]  works is is they go and bed yourselves start replicating your body defeats at
[1:05:19.320 --> 1:05:23.320]  the first few times that it reinfects and that's really what COVID-19 is
[1:05:23.320 --> 1:05:29.720]  COVID-19 is the opening salvo for a whole family of viruses that are in the
[1:05:29.720 --> 1:05:36.360]  COVID Chimera family that are gonna be brought out COVID is like a starter
[1:05:36.360 --> 1:05:42.400]  pistol cartridge it's got powder in it it makes a gunshot noise and if you put a
[1:05:42.400 --> 1:05:47.800]  starter pistol to your head it'll blow gas out of the barrel into your brain and
[1:05:47.800 --> 1:05:52.080]  kill you you know that's how Bruce Lee's son died was playing around with a
[1:05:52.080 --> 1:05:57.760]  starter pistol a lot of folks do that but if you put a bullet in it it's very
[1:05:57.760 --> 1:06:03.960]  deadly and so that's what it is it's a gain of function spreader system to
[1:06:03.960 --> 1:06:09.320]  infect everyone so infection is what's bad infection is the crime infection is
[1:06:09.320 --> 1:06:13.680]  the big deal not the death rate they had to kill a lot of old folks count folks
[1:06:13.680 --> 1:06:18.320]  that died of flu and gunshot wounds and car wrecks in the column now that local
[1:06:18.320 --> 1:06:22.560]  doctors know about that they're refusing when ordered to put COVID-19 on the
[1:06:22.560 --> 1:06:25.280]  death certificate it's like they did six months ago they understood was
[1:06:25.280 --> 1:06:30.000]  political they said no well that's like fine we won't talk about increased deaths
[1:06:30.000 --> 1:06:34.040]  we will simply say look the number of infections is going up
[1:06:34.040 --> 1:06:38.600]  correspondingly with the testing Elon Musk took four tests two came up
[1:06:38.600 --> 1:06:42.840]  positive two came up negative Tanzanian president who's a scientist sent off a
[1:06:42.840 --> 1:06:47.040]  bunch of tests he saw more than 20 but the ones that got attention was the
[1:06:47.040 --> 1:06:54.200]  goat and the papaya both the goat and papaya came up positive and you know he
[1:06:54.200 --> 1:06:58.200]  thought this must be staged because something like 80% of the tests the UN
[1:06:58.200 --> 1:07:01.960]  was getting out of their country were saying the Tanzanians had this but they
[1:07:01.960 --> 1:07:06.480]  weren't sick he said I think the test is faulty by design he's a scientist and
[1:07:06.480 --> 1:07:15.520]  sure enough the goat the papaya the cabbage the some other animal all had
[1:07:15.520 --> 1:07:19.560]  it ladies and gentlemen look it up over 20 things they tested it's all a fraud
[1:07:19.560 --> 1:07:24.680]  it's all a lie it's all a scam and it's only gonna get worse until we say no so
[1:07:24.680 --> 1:07:29.040]  here's the health director of Quebec City candidates in French I won't play
[1:07:29.040 --> 1:07:33.560]  the whole thing but they say if you criticize the lockdown you'll be taken
[1:07:33.560 --> 1:07:37.240]  to the FEMA center it's the same thing up there and here here's a little bit of
[1:07:37.240 --> 1:07:39.960]  the sky this little tyrant
[1:07:39.960 --> 1:07:45.720]  dr. Girard before to terminate a journalist who could not be present here
[1:07:45.720 --> 1:07:50.760]  is that the ordinance was put in place at the place of the client recalcite
[1:07:50.760 --> 1:07:55.600]  yes thank you dr. Girard
[1:07:55.600 --> 1:08:02.120]  all right that's enough now this is a medical tyranny not oh listen to the
[1:08:02.120 --> 1:08:05.880]  doctors they're the scientists you they know you don't know well most of the
[1:08:05.880 --> 1:08:11.680]  doctors say it's all a hoax and a fraud to scam okay most of the doctors know
[1:08:11.680 --> 1:08:16.560]  it's a giant fraud but they don't get to have voices in fact they get shut down
[1:08:16.560 --> 1:08:20.360]  online because you got to listen to the scientists these few select people like
[1:08:20.360 --> 1:08:27.280]  Fauci and this dirt bag let's listen to dr. Boutard was a medical doctor he has
[1:08:27.280 --> 1:08:32.040]  a show that's popular called asked Boutard and here he is this is being
[1:08:32.040 --> 1:08:34.960]  censored off Facebook off Twitter off everywhere so we're gonna add it to the
[1:08:34.960 --> 1:08:40.240]  censored page at band.video and he's reading a real document I've got it
[1:08:40.240 --> 1:08:43.960]  all right here it's in the news months after this came out but this is going
[1:08:43.960 --> 1:08:48.480]  viral now and so here's what they don't want you to see the full video is posted
[1:08:48.480 --> 1:08:52.880]  in the live show feed today under my live show feed at historic Friday
[1:08:52.880 --> 1:08:55.800]  transmission you'll announce his planetary lockdown concentration
[1:08:55.800 --> 1:09:01.600]  cancer centers only president Trump and we the free people the planet stand in
[1:09:01.600 --> 1:09:06.640]  the way of world government depopulation plan Alex Jones reports from deep in the
[1:09:06.640 --> 1:09:12.440]  swamp of DC on the eve of the stop the steel march on Saturday at the White
[1:09:12.440 --> 1:09:16.680]  House a lot of folks are here it's big crowds are showing up so be sure and
[1:09:16.680 --> 1:09:20.000]  get here folks this is a story you won't show up for a peaceful march you won't
[1:09:20.000 --> 1:09:24.400]  show up for the fight this will stop the fight if it's big enough but let's go
[1:09:24.400 --> 1:09:32.080]  to dr. Batar here it is sent to me and I'll just say her first name to protect
[1:09:32.080 --> 1:09:38.640]  her identity Denise DENYSE maybe that's not protecting identity because that's
[1:09:38.640 --> 1:09:44.280]  not a common name but anyway Denise is her name and she sent an email and this
[1:09:44.280 --> 1:09:51.180]  email talked about something that's happening in Canada the subject was
[1:09:51.180 --> 1:09:58.320]  leaked email from liberal party of Canada lays out the plan for what's going to
[1:09:58.320 --> 1:10:02.200]  happen in November December and then the first and second and third quarters of
[1:10:02.200 --> 1:10:09.160]  2021 and this is not based upon what in person's opinion is a conjecture is this
[1:10:09.160 --> 1:10:18.280]  is based upon what actually happened at a meeting in the legislative bodies on
[1:10:18.280 --> 1:10:24.360]  the liberal side in Canada so here's what it comes down to the road map and
[1:10:24.360 --> 1:10:29.200]  aim was set out by the PMO and is as follows and I hate looking down when
[1:10:29.200 --> 1:10:34.760]  I'm when I'm reading this so let me see if I can read it this way all right phase
[1:10:34.760 --> 1:10:39.440]  in secondary lockdown restrictions on a rolling basis starting with major
[1:10:39.440 --> 1:10:47.560]  metropolitan areas first and expanding outward expected by November 2020 next one
[1:10:47.560 --> 1:10:52.680]  rush the acquisition off or construction of isolation facilities across every
[1:10:52.680 --> 1:10:57.240]  province and territory expected by December 2020 these are concentration
[1:10:57.240 --> 1:11:02.440]  camps are talking about daily new cases of COVID-19 will surge beyond capacity
[1:11:02.440 --> 1:11:05.120]  of testing interesting that they already know that they're going to surge right
[1:11:05.120 --> 1:11:09.080]  why because they know that it's the more every if there is such a virus out
[1:11:09.080 --> 1:11:12.720]  there assuming that there's a real virus out there the testing is already going
[1:11:12.720 --> 1:11:15.720]  it's already predetermined they're testing their attenuating that they're
[1:11:15.720 --> 1:11:21.480]  basically amplifying the RT PCR test to the point that every human being will
[1:11:21.480 --> 1:11:25.220]  test positive that's what their goal is all right so in the new daily cases of
[1:11:25.220 --> 1:11:28.680]  COVID daily new cases of COVID will surge beyond capacity of testing
[1:11:28.680 --> 1:11:32.240]  including increases in COVID related deaths following the same growth curves
[1:11:32.240 --> 1:11:37.960]  expected by end of November 2020 complete and total secondary lockdown much
[1:11:37.960 --> 1:11:41.400]  stricter than the first and second rolling phase restrictions expected by
[1:11:41.400 --> 1:11:47.400]  end of December 2020 early January 2021 reform and expansion of the unemployment
[1:11:47.400 --> 1:11:51.680]  program to be transitioned into the universal basic income program except
[1:11:51.680 --> 1:11:58.440]  expected by quarter one 2021 projected COVID-19 mutation and or co-infection
[1:11:58.440 --> 1:12:03.600]  with secondary virus referred to as COVID-21 leading to a third wave with
[1:12:03.600 --> 1:12:08.800]  much higher mortality rate and higher rate of infection expected by February
[1:12:08.800 --> 1:12:14.040]  2021 daily new cases of COVID-21 hospitalizations and COVID-19 and
[1:12:14.040 --> 1:12:18.800]  COVID-21 related deaths will exceed medical facility capacities
[1:12:18.800 --> 1:12:23.760]  guys bring me on guys back that up 20 seconds and come back and again I have
[1:12:23.760 --> 1:12:27.360]  this came out months and months ago people oh it's not real now I have

[1:14:47.440 --> 1:15:03.440]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:15:11.440 --> 1:15:15.200]  I want to be clear here again Alex Jones back live from Washington DC on the
[1:15:15.200 --> 1:15:21.360]  big marks of our 12 men right outside the White House most people aren't
[1:15:21.360 --> 1:15:24.520]  inherently evil we're all falling we've all sinned we've all fallen short of
[1:15:24.520 --> 1:15:29.400]  glory God but we still love God we love justice but there are people that love
[1:15:29.400 --> 1:15:35.480]  Satan take Fauci right behind me if you're a TV viewer he is acting like he
[1:15:35.480 --> 1:15:39.240]  is happy as a pig and you know what and I've been watching all the former
[1:15:39.240 --> 1:15:42.680]  Homeland Security has talked about the permanent lockdown how they're taking
[1:15:42.680 --> 1:15:47.960]  over how great it is it makes you all alkyda suspects and all they're doing is
[1:15:47.960 --> 1:15:51.640]  making the test more and more sensitive where if there's any viral debris or
[1:15:51.640 --> 1:15:57.120]  bacterial debris it says you have COVID it's very simple it's a little
[1:15:57.120 --> 1:16:00.880]  computer a swab up your nose and the computer sees what's going on and it's
[1:16:00.880 --> 1:16:05.960]  why one person says positive one person says negative but you get the flu you
[1:16:05.960 --> 1:16:10.040]  get pneumonia they're gonna kill your ass with the innovation if you go to the
[1:16:10.040 --> 1:16:15.160]  wrong hospital so this is life and death to warn everyone we know and stop
[1:16:15.160 --> 1:16:18.040]  being these people just look at our phones all day but talk to other people
[1:16:18.040 --> 1:16:22.680]  that's the real fight here I want to take your calls about the election about
[1:16:22.680 --> 1:16:27.440]  the election fraud about what President Trump should do I saw an article last
[1:16:27.440 --> 1:16:30.440]  night where Trump will speak when the time is right now he's getting his
[1:16:30.440 --> 1:16:35.400]  evidence of fraud ready and it's there it's massive I want to be clear about
[1:16:35.400 --> 1:16:40.440]  something the globalists have run this whole COVID exaggeration hoax situation
[1:16:40.440 --> 1:16:45.240]  they have lied to us on so many fronts Joe Biden is a communist Chinese agent
[1:16:45.240 --> 1:16:51.240]  even if Joe Biden had legally won this election which he didn't he's illegitimate
[1:16:51.240 --> 1:16:54.800]  because he's a communist Chinese agent and that needs to be the tack of the
[1:16:54.800 --> 1:16:58.560]  president that he's a communist Chinese agent they said Trump was a Russian
[1:16:58.560 --> 1:17:01.440]  agent and was illegitimate and he almost didn't get inaugurated with no
[1:17:01.440 --> 1:17:08.040]  evidence you're talking about empty air not one shred of proof empty air but
[1:17:08.040 --> 1:17:15.960]  with the case of Trump it's as solid as this table that he's a patriot but with
[1:17:15.960 --> 1:17:22.960]  the case of Biden we have him dead to rights open and shut but again the
[1:17:22.960 --> 1:17:26.240]  globalists are going for broke they're gonna steal elections they're gonna lie
[1:17:26.240 --> 1:17:30.360]  they're gonna exaggerate COVID deaths hundreds of times they are they're never
[1:17:30.360 --> 1:17:34.120]  gonna let go once they get their teeth into you because they're ruthless and
[1:17:34.120 --> 1:17:39.600]  they want power and they were brought into cults how many times did I tell you
[1:17:39.600 --> 1:17:47.560]  about my dad my dad volunteered he thought for a pre-induction system in
[1:17:47.560 --> 1:17:53.640]  Donassa okay and by the time it was 15 he was an MD Anderson cancer research
[1:17:53.640 --> 1:18:02.080]  facility in Houston working in absolutely incredible stuff okay and then
[1:18:02.080 --> 1:18:09.280]  he was in plan to UT by 16 and they were only letting a very small number of
[1:18:09.280 --> 1:18:13.200]  people in the whole state of Texas who tested the high score levels into this
[1:18:13.200 --> 1:18:17.280]  they called him in they go here's a secret reactor nuclear reactor under UT
[1:18:17.280 --> 1:18:21.360]  we don't tell the public about the nuclear reactor they said they took him
[1:18:21.360 --> 1:18:25.240]  and they said here's our computers here's our CD-ROMs weren't invented for 20
[1:18:25.240 --> 1:18:29.280]  years don't tell the public about this and when I was my dad didn't tell me
[1:18:29.280 --> 1:18:34.280]  this stuff till I was older I'd heard this and that when I was a kid I knew
[1:18:34.280 --> 1:18:38.480]  that they when he was 16 they delivered him an 18-wheeler with the parts to
[1:18:38.480 --> 1:18:43.000]  build a Ruby laser as part of a union carbide thing I mean it was part of the
[1:18:43.000 --> 1:18:46.880]  Eisenhower's whiz kid program but Eisenhower later learned what it really
[1:18:46.880 --> 1:18:51.080]  was and all these kids wanted to be in NASA they weren't getting recruited for
[1:18:51.080 --> 1:18:56.000]  NASA ladies and gentlemen and so finally my dad was top of the top of those
[1:18:56.000 --> 1:19:02.600]  groups so they call him in he's 17 years old he's at the head of the body
[1:19:02.600 --> 1:19:08.960]  department's house and it's an old Jewish guy Professor Spear he closes the
[1:19:08.960 --> 1:19:13.920]  door and he goes David he goes we don't like Hitler he was only gonna get
[1:19:13.920 --> 1:19:17.920]  certain people but we do eugenics is real and we have to get rid of the bad
[1:19:17.920 --> 1:19:23.000]  people of every group and you're part of the good group now and we want you to
[1:19:23.000 --> 1:19:27.880]  be part of this and my dad was involved in a few years and got out of it okay but
[1:19:27.880 --> 1:19:32.200]  this they did this with millions of people Fauci all of them were recruited
[1:19:32.200 --> 1:19:37.120]  by Robert Barron scientist he's 70 you know nine years old so they bring them
[1:19:37.120 --> 1:19:43.200]  in they go there's too many people Tony and you are in charge and you're an
[1:19:43.200 --> 1:19:48.080]  elitist and you're you're 16 you're 17 you get recruited out of high school
[1:19:48.080 --> 1:19:52.800]  before you're out of high school and you're told that the earth has a carrying
[1:19:52.800 --> 1:19:58.560]  capacity just like bacteria in a petri dish with the cuter and they're gonna
[1:19:58.560 --> 1:20:01.080]  eat through that and it's limited resources and we're gonna kill the
[1:20:01.080 --> 1:20:06.480]  planet and he managed to die Tony Tony we need you to join us and be part of
[1:20:06.480 --> 1:20:09.840]  this is gonna be some hard stuff we got to do we're gonna have to just like
[1:20:09.840 --> 1:20:14.000]  breeding dogs to get certain breeds you'd have hundreds of breedings and
[1:20:14.000 --> 1:20:16.400]  they would take the puppies that didn't have the traits they liked and put them
[1:20:16.400 --> 1:20:19.800]  in a cage and put them in water and it looks really sad but we got we got
[1:20:19.800 --> 1:20:25.320]  poodles we got German shepherds we did the hard thing to get these cool dogs
[1:20:25.320 --> 1:20:31.680]  well we're gonna do it with humans Tony Tony you're the best we want to groom
[1:20:31.680 --> 1:20:36.840]  you for position of power and here he is it almost 80 years old and he's a
[1:20:36.840 --> 1:20:43.920]  planetary ruler he's this little god he knows best like John P. Holdren and all
[1:20:43.920 --> 1:20:46.760]  of them and I've read their books I've read their writings John P. Holdren
[1:20:46.760 --> 1:20:51.200]  Obama science are said use a virus to take over put fluoride in the water to
[1:20:51.200 --> 1:20:55.840]  sterilize people give them forced inoculations dumb them down use zip
[1:20:55.840 --> 1:20:59.760]  codes according to how low income somebody is we'll give them this
[1:20:59.760 --> 1:21:03.080]  vaccine and this and this zip code we'll give people this vaccine and that zip
[1:21:03.080 --> 1:21:08.680]  code and that's why that's why Gates again on Japanese TV said listen you've
[1:21:08.680 --> 1:21:14.120]  heard we're sterilizing people do this he goes don't worry about that the third
[1:21:14.120 --> 1:21:19.400]  world is a different vaccine and the Japanese reporter went oh I mean this
[1:21:19.400 --> 1:21:27.080]  is the real deal folks okay and so they tried to recruit everybody I remember
[1:21:27.080 --> 1:21:31.400]  reading having historians on a reading Anthony Sutton's book and about how you
[1:21:31.400 --> 1:21:34.080]  have somebody top of their class in high school in what was where it was
[1:21:34.080 --> 1:21:38.520]  Minnesota it's a valedictorian in the lunch line and David Rockefeller just
[1:21:38.520 --> 1:21:44.200]  pops up and goes you've got the highest test scores in every field and we know
[1:21:44.200 --> 1:21:47.360]  you want for some advanced testing that this group offered you and we found
[1:21:47.360 --> 1:21:52.200]  you're really we want you and they just want every thinker for them and so
[1:21:52.200 --> 1:21:55.600]  that's what Google and Facebook are telling you only our thinkers can talk
[1:21:55.600 --> 1:22:02.240]  only our thinkers can be heard only our thinkers can be on air no one else can't
[1:22:02.240 --> 1:22:07.320]  and it's all about wiping out almost everybody and establishing a world
[1:22:07.320 --> 1:22:10.640]  government but that was the old story oh we're doing this to save the earth now
[1:22:10.640 --> 1:22:14.880]  they're like you know humans are bad we're gonna be a silicon life form we're
[1:22:14.880 --> 1:22:19.120]  gonna override all the genetics the planet we're gonna be gods and people
[1:22:19.120 --> 1:22:21.840]  like well I thought we're gonna save the earth don't yeah yeah we can build a
[1:22:21.840 --> 1:22:26.160]  hundred earths let's actually genetically engineer everything and change it all
[1:22:26.160 --> 1:22:30.160]  let's have human animal hybrids let's do it all it's all there see so it's all
[1:22:30.160 --> 1:22:35.080]  alive folks it's all satanic it's all evil they try to dumb us down to control
[1:22:35.080 --> 1:22:39.640]  us they're not trying to build us up they're not trying to take the smart
[1:22:39.640 --> 1:22:43.400]  people to join them because they care about smart people it's an alien evil
[1:22:43.400 --> 1:22:48.400]  spirit an alien dimensional force as the Bible says it wants to kill steal and
[1:22:48.400 --> 1:22:52.600]  destroy and it's come to get our intelligentsia so no one would stand
[1:22:52.600 --> 1:22:57.640]  against them when the time came and they came to flatter the intelligentsia when
[1:22:57.640 --> 1:23:03.040]  they were high school students and to say you're gonna join NASA it's like well
[1:23:03.040 --> 1:23:07.200]  the slots are filled for NASA for 15 year olds but how would you like us to
[1:23:07.200 --> 1:23:11.600]  deliver you an 18-wheeler with a laser and see if you can build it how do you
[1:23:11.600 --> 1:23:14.960]  like to see the nuclear reactor nobody else gets to see this how do you like to
[1:23:14.960 --> 1:23:18.240]  cross humans with animals in our lab I've had the scientists call in I've had
[1:23:18.240 --> 1:23:21.720]  guests on the same deal where they're like research scientists now 25 years

[1:31:27.360 --> 1:31:30.640]  he was too confident
[1:31:30.920 --> 1:31:37.440]  doesn't matter we wish we still had him hopefully we get him but in a way let it
[1:31:37.440 --> 1:31:43.080]  get worse let him come you'll see they're already on El Paso TV saying we're

[1:31:45.720 --> 1:31:52.680]  facility this is the doctors we trust not normal doctors special doctors
[1:31:52.680 --> 1:31:57.440]  appointed for their evil let's go back to the video of the doctor projected
[1:31:57.440 --> 1:32:02.200]  COVID-19 mutation and or co-infection with secondary virus referred to as
[1:32:02.200 --> 1:32:08.040]  COVID-21 leading to a third wave with much higher mortality rate and higher
[1:32:08.040 --> 1:32:13.960]  rate of infection expected by February 2021 daily new cases of COVID-21
[1:32:13.960 --> 1:32:18.520]  hospitalizations and COVID-19 and COVID-21 related deaths will exceed
[1:32:18.520 --> 1:32:26.480]  medical facility capacities expected by quarter first by Q1 Q2 of 221 enhanced
[1:32:26.480 --> 1:32:30.680]  lockdown restrictions referred to as third lockdown will be implemented full
[1:32:30.680 --> 1:32:34.440]  travel restrictions will be imposed including inter-province and intercity
[1:32:34.440 --> 1:32:38.600]  expected by quarter to 2021 guys understand that that means that if you're
[1:32:38.600 --> 1:32:45.360]  if you're in British Columbia you can't go to Quebec all right this is what
[1:32:45.360 --> 1:32:48.720]  they're talking about and if you're in one city and you try to go into another
[1:32:48.720 --> 1:32:51.480]  city in the same province they're not gonna try to they're not gonna allow you
[1:32:51.480 --> 1:32:55.440]  to do that this is in Canada of course they're gonna try to roll this out and
[1:32:55.440 --> 1:33:04.400]  I'll get to that point here in a second all right transitioning of individuals
[1:33:04.400 --> 1:33:11.800]  into the universal basic income program expected mid quarter to 2021 projected
[1:33:11.800 --> 1:33:17.200]  supply chain breakdowns in inventory storage large economic instability all
[1:33:17.200 --> 1:33:23.200]  expected late second quarter 2021 deployment of military personnel into
[1:33:23.200 --> 1:33:27.640]  major metropolitan areas as well as all major roadways to establish travel
[1:33:27.640 --> 1:33:32.280]  checkpoints restrict travel and movement provide logistical support to the area
[1:33:32.280 --> 1:33:39.520]  expected by third quarter 2021 along with that provided roadmap the strategic
[1:33:39.520 --> 1:33:43.320]  planning committee was asked to design an effective way of transitioning
[1:33:43.320 --> 1:33:47.800]  Canadians to meet an unprecedented economic endeavor one that would change
[1:33:47.800 --> 1:33:52.400]  the face of Canada and forever alter the lives of Canadians alright guys this is
[1:33:52.400 --> 1:33:57.880]  where it gets really disturbing as if it's not already disturbing what we are
[1:33:57.880 --> 1:34:03.320]  told was that in order to offset what was essentially an economic collapse on
[1:34:03.320 --> 1:34:06.920]  an international scale that the federal government was going to offer
[1:34:06.920 --> 1:34:11.480]  Canadians a total debt relief so people are getting excited about that that
[1:34:11.480 --> 1:34:16.640]  sounds good but wait this is how it works the federal government will offer to
[1:34:16.640 --> 1:34:20.040]  eliminate all personal debts all mortgages all loans all credit cards
[1:34:20.040 --> 1:34:24.600]  etc with all funding which all funding will be provided to Canada by the IMF
[1:34:24.600 --> 1:34:30.240]  under what will become known as the world debt reset program in exchange for
[1:34:30.240 --> 1:34:33.600]  acceptance of this total debt forgiveness the individual would forfeit
[1:34:33.600 --> 1:34:41.600]  ownership of any and all property and assets forever in exchange for acceptance
[1:34:41.600 --> 1:34:45.200]  of this total debt forgiveness the individual would forfeit ownership of
[1:34:45.200 --> 1:34:52.880]  any and all property and assets forever the individual would also have to agree
[1:34:52.880 --> 1:34:58.400]  to partake in the COVID-19 COVID-21 vaccination schedule which will provide
[1:34:58.400 --> 1:35:04.640]  the individual with unrestricted travel and unrestricted living even under a
[1:35:04.640 --> 1:35:09.520]  full lockdown so if you agree you can go do anything you're doing as long as you
[1:35:09.520 --> 1:35:13.880]  partake in the COVID-19 and COVID-21 vaccination schedule regardless of the
[1:35:13.880 --> 1:35:18.120]  lockdown magically you take this vaccine and boom guess what you don't
[1:35:18.120 --> 1:35:20.680]  have to social distance you don't have to wear a mask anymore because you have
[1:35:20.680 --> 1:35:25.600]  already gotten your vaccines alright so this is unrestricted living under even
[1:35:25.600 --> 1:35:30.280]  under a full lockdown through the use of a photo identification referred to as
[1:35:30.280 --> 1:35:36.440]  Canada's health pass committee members asked who would become the owner of the
[1:35:36.440 --> 1:35:41.200]  forfeited property and assets in that scenario and what would happen to lead
[1:35:41.200 --> 1:35:46.960]  to lenders of financial institutions we were simply told the world debt reset
[1:35:46.960 --> 1:35:50.200]  program will handle all of the details so when that was they were asked what
[1:35:50.200 --> 1:35:53.560]  happens to the property and what happens to the banks don't worry about it we're
[1:35:53.560 --> 1:35:56.960]  going to take care of it that's what they were told
[1:35:56.960 --> 1:36:05.080]  alright and now it gets really really interesting wow committee members asked
[1:36:05.080 --> 1:36:08.800]  who would become I'm sorry excuse me I read that several committee members also
[1:36:08.800 --> 1:36:12.840]  question what would happen to individuals if they refuse to participate in the
[1:36:12.840 --> 1:36:17.840]  world debt reset program or the health pass or the vaccination schedule the
[1:36:17.840 --> 1:36:24.240]  answer we got was very troubling essentially we were told it was our duty to
[1:36:24.240 --> 1:36:27.760]  make sure we come up with the plan meaning the Liberal Party was told that
[1:36:27.760 --> 1:36:32.000]  it was their duty to come up with the plan to ensure that would never happen
[1:36:32.000 --> 1:36:36.440]  we were told it was the it was in the individual's best interest to
[1:36:36.440 --> 1:36:40.160]  participate when several committee members pushed relentlessly to get
[1:36:40.160 --> 1:36:49.040]  back and finish this up and go to your phone calls get ready for the news about bread
[1:36:49.040 --> 1:36:53.800]  talk about tomorrow's news today this is all very transparent when you wore game
[1:36:53.800 --> 1:36:58.280]  it out six months ago in four was predicted the mail-in ballots would be
[1:36:58.280 --> 1:37:02.440]  used to steal the election from prompt they would simply pause the voting at
[1:37:02.440 --> 1:37:06.000]  night and that have an unlimited number that they had in reserve to bring
[1:37:06.000 --> 1:37:09.480]  forward in battleground states to secure the victory and now that happened
[1:37:09.480 --> 1:37:13.560]  now what else did I predict a few months ago and again last week and again last
[1:37:13.560 --> 1:37:18.720]  night all on record that when Joe Biden was president-elect via fraud Trump
[1:37:18.720 --> 1:37:22.800]  would challenge it but Biden's next move would be to form his own covert
[1:37:22.800 --> 1:37:27.440]  task force say that Trump is inept and has killed 267,000 Americans which is
[1:37:27.440 --> 1:37:31.800]  it true and demand Trump's removal via the 25th Amendment if he doesn't let
[1:37:31.800 --> 1:37:36.240]  Joe Biden's new covert task force give all the new orders they'll tell Trump
[1:37:36.240 --> 1:37:39.400]  that if he backs down and follows their orders and steps down they won't blame
[1:37:39.400 --> 1:37:42.680]  for coven but if he does it they're gonna blame for coven but then if he does do
[1:37:42.680 --> 1:37:46.120]  what they say he's talking about many ways plus this is meant for martial law
[1:37:46.120 --> 1:37:50.960]  destroy the economy I warned you all remember Hillary Clinton remember Pelosi
[1:37:50.960 --> 1:37:56.200]  remember Bill Clinton remember Obama all of them said we are not gonna concede
[1:37:56.200 --> 1:37:59.920]  if there's a red mirage we believe it's gonna look like Trump's gonna win in
[1:37:59.920 --> 1:38:04.720]  landslides they have the internal polls and indeed Trump won most of the states
[1:38:04.720 --> 1:38:08.000]  he won last time by an even bigger margin and when he was set to win the
[1:38:08.000 --> 1:38:14.120]  other ones they froze the seven states on election night and then they brought
[1:38:14.120 --> 1:38:17.480]  in all of the reserve ballots they had this is completely transparent so when
[1:38:17.480 --> 1:38:21.600]  they say that he is president elect he's not Trump is not conceded none of the
[1:38:21.600 --> 1:38:24.720]  states have certified the vote and now all these investigations have been opened
[1:38:24.720 --> 1:38:29.720]  up and avalanches mountains oceans of election fraud has come out and already
[1:38:29.720 --> 1:38:33.920]  been documented in Georgia officials are on record saying we've already found
[1:38:33.920 --> 1:38:38.420]  fraud so ladies and gentlemen the fixes in they've run bigger and bigger hoaxes
[1:38:38.420 --> 1:38:42.800]  every time because the last hoax failed but now this is the mother of all hoaxes
[1:38:42.800 --> 1:38:46.160]  and if they get away with this it's the end of America as we know it we will be

[1:45:09.720 --> 1:45:15.680]  you alex on November 1st 2020 the CDC officially told all Americans that
[1:45:15.680 --> 1:45:20.680]  people who had recently tested positive for COVID and were current currently in
[1:45:20.680 --> 1:45:26.240]  quarantine were free to go in person to the election polls and vote my wife and
[1:45:26.240 --> 1:45:30.240]  I voted a local church here in Indianapolis and we could not go to any
[1:45:30.240 --> 1:45:35.440]  church for much of 2020 because of COVID nevertheless the CDC announced via
[1:45:35.440 --> 1:45:41.880]  the media including CNN and Microsoft News MSN that COVID positive persons who
[1:45:41.880 --> 1:45:46.320]  were in quarantine were free to go into polling places inside churches all
[1:45:46.320 --> 1:45:51.160]  across our country along with massive lines of uninfected voters and these
[1:45:51.160 --> 1:45:55.680]  COVID infected people under quarantine could do this in order to protect the
[1:45:55.680 --> 1:46:02.040]  COVID positive voters constitutional right to vote however our first amendment
[1:46:02.040 --> 1:46:07.320]  constitutional rights to worship Jesus Christ in our churches here in Indian
[1:46:07.320 --> 1:46:12.560] apolis during most of 2020 has been violated in an ongoing and massive way
[1:46:12.560 --> 1:46:17.480]  by our Republican governor Eric Holcomb and our Democrat Mayor Joe Hogsett
[1:46:17.480 --> 1:46:22.760]  furthermore our Attorney General Curtis Hill here in Indiana wrote an amazing
[1:46:22.760 --> 1:46:28.720]  legal opinion detailing this exact unconstitutional denial of our first
[1:46:28.720 --> 1:46:33.000]  amendment rights to worship God in our churches and the Attorney General's
[1:46:33.000 --> 1:46:37.840]  opinion verified these completely unconstitutional acts by both Governor
[1:46:37.840 --> 1:46:43.680]  Eric Holcomb and Mayor Joe Hogsett again wasn't COVID the entire reason for
[1:46:43.680 --> 1:46:48.240]  mail-in ballots which is President Trump predicted have now produced massive
[1:46:48.240 --> 1:46:52.320]  voter fraud on a scale we have never seen before here in the United States
[1:46:52.320 --> 1:46:57.040]  citizens were told we had to have massive fraud mail-in ballots to protect
[1:46:57.040 --> 1:47:02.840]  us from COVID but now CDC's actions urging COVID positive people who were in
[1:47:02.840 --> 1:47:07.880]  quarantine to go in person and vote at polls located inside inside churches
[1:47:07.880 --> 1:47:12.800]  all across our nation has fully and forever exposed the entire COVID hoax
[1:47:12.800 --> 1:47:17.480]  and the massive deep state voter fraud of mail-in ballots in one single
[1:47:17.480 --> 1:47:23.360]  revealing act by the deep state and the CDC well let me just say this you want
[1:47:23.360 --> 1:47:26.960]  to be hired as a writer for info wars that's total truth if this guy's name and
[1:47:26.960 --> 1:47:30.040]  number I'd love to have you on as a guest you callers are so incredible but
[1:47:30.040 --> 1:47:36.200]  absolutely with the left it's all about killing common sense like our churches
[1:47:36.200 --> 1:47:41.880]  can't be open but bars can be open or or or the porno shops or Walmart but then
[1:47:41.880 --> 1:47:45.400]  your small business can't be and now we're gonna send contact tracers like
[1:47:45.400 --> 1:47:49.320]  that in Europe to make sure not having too big a Christmas party they all want
[1:47:49.320 --> 1:47:54.360]  to get good people that follow the rules to follow illegal rules to be total
[1:47:54.360 --> 1:47:58.440]  slaves and Trump obviously won the election it's all a giant fraud that's
[1:47:58.440 --> 1:48:02.920]  been proven and we're just in such a crisis and so when I tell people that
[1:48:02.920 --> 1:48:05.840]  things aren't ever going back to normal I'm not trying to be negative I'm being
[1:48:05.840 --> 1:48:10.560]  honest we are coming under judgment but I'll tell you the good news about
[1:48:10.560 --> 1:48:14.120]  judgment as you know now people are gonna really wake up there's gonna be a
[1:48:14.120 --> 1:48:18.640]  backlash to this that is mega massive what do you think's gonna come next well
[1:48:18.640 --> 1:48:24.200]  you know I first of all I'm honored that you would say that because I would do
[1:48:24.200 --> 1:48:30.320]  anything to help this movement of the people of the United States who are
[1:48:30.320 --> 1:48:35.960]  who are trying their hearts out to honor God and you know what's great about
[1:48:35.960 --> 1:48:42.040]  Trump is when he stands up at these rallies and he says you know minority
[1:48:42.040 --> 1:48:46.600]  unemployment is that the lowest rate you know in years and decades and we're all
[1:48:46.600 --> 1:48:51.000]  saying yay you know we want to get together we want to have a great
[1:48:51.000 --> 1:48:56.160]  country he's saying you know Latino unemployment is that the lowest rate
[1:48:56.160 --> 1:49:00.440]  and the enemy wants to divide us it's so it's so obvious that they're evil it's
[1:49:00.440 --> 1:49:04.320]  so obvious they're bad and that's what it comes down to hey we're doing that show
[1:49:04.320 --> 1:49:07.120]  soon we're getting all the names get his name a number I want to get him on as a
[1:49:07.120 --> 1:49:11.480]  guest we're gonna start you know what I'm gonna get back Sunday but start next

[1:49:18.400 --> 1:49:24.400]  on this is a power grab they've lied at every level it's a hoax but it's the
[1:49:24.400 --> 1:49:29.400]  corporate bureaucracy with the blue states blue cities and leftist political
[1:49:29.400 --> 1:49:34.440]  parties worldwide forcing their will on us and they know it even their low level
[1:49:34.440 --> 1:49:38.040]  people know it's a power grab well what's the left gonna think of Biden gets in

[1:50:40.520 --> 1:50:44.840]  excellent to add to his point a lot of what we're dealing with here in North
[1:50:44.840 --> 1:50:51.080]  Carolina considering the lockdowns is it kind of depends on the region North
[1:50:51.080 --> 1:50:56.720]  Carolina so split you know a lot of your more rural country side you got left
[1:50:56.720 --> 1:51:00.680]  this they keep you locked down if you're got conservative they know exactly right
[1:51:00.680 --> 1:51:05.880]  exactly but one thing and I don't know if a lot of people are really paying as
[1:51:05.880 --> 1:51:09.520]  much attention I know a lot of more people have gotten politically active
[1:51:09.520 --> 1:51:14.520]  this year which is absolutely great but they do need to be paying very close
[1:51:14.520 --> 1:51:21.000]  attention to your really local legislative and and more along the lines
[1:51:21.000 --> 1:51:27.280]  of your state officials because with Roy Cooper who is a complete and total
[1:51:27.280 --> 1:51:33.840]  cook he's trying to he's trying to roll this you know mid-phase absolutely the

[1:51:38.080 --> 1:51:43.240]  much John cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left it can be
[1:51:43.240 --> 1:51:48.160]  very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept if you have a family

[1:52:41.960 --> 1:52:46.400]  been two basic forms of civilizations in different mixes of the two one is
[1:52:46.400 --> 1:52:50.760]  born of Renaissance the other is born of conquest one bases its power on having
[1:52:50.760 --> 1:52:56.360]  strong enlightened focused people with an ethos and a culture and ingenuity art
[1:52:56.360 --> 1:53:01.040]  and skill and strength the other is based on the massive number of slaves it
[1:53:01.040 --> 1:53:07.240]  controls with a tiny elite above it America is transferring out of a system
[1:53:07.240 --> 1:53:11.800]  based on the ethos of liberty and freedom into one of total mass high tech
[1:53:11.800 --> 1:53:15.480]  slavery that's why the globalists tell us America was founded up slavery when
[1:53:15.480 --> 1:53:19.280]  it wasn't they point out one of our evils so they can invert the fact that
[1:53:19.280 --> 1:53:23.640]  they are truly the slave masters a global permanent lockdown is here is
[1:53:23.640 --> 1:53:26.760]  already causing millions and millions of starved death when they're done
[1:53:26.760 --> 1:53:29.960]  billions will start with that even the former head of the Ministry of Defense
[1:53:29.960 --> 1:53:34.280]  in England and a top general have come out and said the covered lockdown is going
[1:53:34.280 --> 1:53:38.400]  to trigger a giant new world war that's the facts this is the Bill Gates new
[1:53:38.400 --> 1:53:47.240]  world-order weapon you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:54:01.360 --> 1:54:07.280]  all right we have mega massive Trump news that's about to break I am right
[1:54:07.280 --> 1:54:11.760]  down the street from the White House oh and Troyer and my son Rex Jones now a
[1:54:11.760 --> 1:54:18.080]  man 18 years are out there fighting hard we got big news ladies and gentlemen
[1:54:18.080 --> 1:54:23.200]  and so this is very exciting as a little event is coming up about 15 after
[1:54:23.200 --> 1:54:28.560]  let's go back to your calls right now my wife is calling me so I'm on the phone
[1:54:28.560 --> 1:54:34.560]  using that Taylor in New Jersey you're on the air go ahead hello Alex I'm the
[1:54:34.560 --> 1:54:38.840]  breathwork guy that you said you would do a half hour segment with before we want
[1:54:38.840 --> 1:54:42.480]  to get you on soon that's why we're gonna start yes sir we want to get you on yes
[1:54:42.480 --> 1:54:46.200]  sir all right what I want to say real quick was I think that the left is
[1:54:46.200 --> 1:54:49.800]  because the left obviously what they are with their line with and that God
[1:54:49.800 --> 1:54:54.240]  creates itself and evil destroys itself I feel like the left is winding up their
[1:54:54.240 --> 1:54:58.680]  people they projected this win so that when Trump does win on the day of the
[1:54:58.680 --> 1:55:02.640]  eclipse with December 14th when that all gets sorted out I feel like it's just
[1:55:02.640 --> 1:55:05.360]  gonna create bedlam in the streets and that's why I feel like that they're
[1:55:05.360 --> 1:55:09.160]  going right into the COVID news now to create a lockdown scenario and all those
[1:55:09.160 --> 1:55:12.840]  leftist areas to lock those people down to suppress them even more but if they
[1:55:12.840 --> 1:55:17.240]  go crazy when Trump wins to really stop this civil war and I feel like that that's
[1:55:17.240 --> 1:55:21.120]  really what they set up so that totally agree with you I totally agree with you
[1:55:21.120 --> 1:55:24.840]  sir what else you think's coming I feel like you were saying about the bio
[1:55:24.840 --> 1:55:28.680]  attack thing I feel like just just going with God here and looking at the
[1:55:28.680 --> 1:55:32.040]  alignment and God's handiwork here just look there's a great conjunction on
[1:55:32.040 --> 1:55:36.680]  December 21st and for me my heart I feel like that that's gonna be a they're
[1:55:36.680 --> 1:55:40.320]  gonna try to do that that week from the as you said the Bible says the evidence
[1:55:40.320 --> 1:55:46.560]  of God is in the firmament yes sir Psalm 19 and 1 yes sir I feel like that on
[1:55:46.560 --> 1:55:51.400]  December 21st from all the planets from what I'm looking at astrologically
[1:55:51.400 --> 1:55:53.720]  because that's just the handiwork of God I feel like there's gonna there's an
[1:55:53.720 --> 1:55:57.000]  alignment obviously there will be an alignment on the on that day they call
[1:55:57.000 --> 1:56:00.240]  it a great conjunction it doesn't happen often and it's a massive shift in the
[1:56:00.240 --> 1:56:04.080]  consciousness I feel like there will be a coronal coronal mass ejection on
[1:56:04.080 --> 1:56:08.440]  December 21st and they'll call it a bio attack and all of the superpowers of the
[1:56:08.440 --> 1:56:11.840]  world will point fingers and then they'll lock their people down and then
[1:56:11.840 --> 1:56:15.960]  we'll really be in this thing well I'll tell you I look at the globalists
[1:56:15.960 --> 1:56:19.480]  whether it's Zuckerberg or whether it's they look scared if you notice that
[1:56:19.480 --> 1:56:25.240]  they look really scared what are they so scared of I feel like they know they
[1:56:25.240 --> 1:56:28.960]  know that God they they are definitely aware of God like you said these people
[1:56:28.960 --> 1:56:32.760]  are not atheists they're just they have a malalignment or misalignment however you
[1:56:32.760 --> 1:56:36.760]  want to look at it but these people are you know firmly aware that there is one
[1:56:36.760 --> 1:56:42.480]  source of power and all they can do is manipulate and try to you jade the
[1:56:42.480 --> 1:56:46.720]  perspective of that power but they're they're totally aware I feel like they're
[1:56:46.720 --> 1:56:50.080]  just trying to get as many people as they can to create you know their flocks
[1:56:50.080 --> 1:56:54.240]  and try to absorb as much energy as they can while this is their time this is it
[1:56:54.240 --> 1:56:58.160]  this is their last shot like this is the death rows of pure evil and you know in
[1:56:58.160 --> 1:57:02.320]  human form and I think they're they're fully aware that you know love always
[1:57:02.320 --> 1:57:06.960]  wins God always wins is just that through these challenges we cultivate our
[1:57:06.960 --> 1:57:11.480]  divine nature for us to reach heaven we need these challenges to cultivate that
[1:57:11.480 --> 1:57:15.440]  divine nature and and there you know at some level our enemies are a gift so
[1:57:15.440 --> 1:57:18.440]  that we can cultivate this and this is the challenge I feel like you know the
[1:57:18.440 --> 1:57:22.080]  people that are of the spirit of the breath or everyone look up at the spirit
[1:57:22.080 --> 1:57:28.120]  of Christ the breath of Christ I hear you sir Taylor you make me feel

[1:58:19.080 --> 1:58:24.040]  scared you know people don't realize that Paul Krugman and other globalist
[1:58:24.040 --> 1:58:29.360]  economics have been forced to admit that globalization hurt America there's a
[1:58:29.360 --> 1:58:33.920]  lot of articles don't hang up don't hang up Todd I'm gonna come right back to you
[1:58:33.920 --> 1:58:38.320]  and a few more callers chase and mark and then I've got Eslore event coming up

[1:58:41.920 --> 1:58:47.720]  side back in 60 seconds news wars dot com ban dot video info wars dot com tomorrow
[1:58:47.720 --> 1:58:52.120]  is DNA force plus if you did one thing for your immune system you would be get
[1:58:52.120 --> 1:58:55.960]  all the essential things and that's the clean eye nine x2 or x3 that's the
[1:58:55.960 --> 1:59:00.560]  bio tricillinium that is the vitamin D3 that is the sea that is the zinc there's
[1:59:00.560 --> 1:59:03.240]  13 vitamins and minerals that are essential that I'm you die and studies
[1:59:03.240 --> 1:59:06.560]  show you really the other ones too but DNA force goes beyond that it helps get
[1:59:06.560 --> 1:59:10.360]  all that in the cells and out the cells with pqq and coq 10 of the highest
[1:59:10.360 --> 1:59:15.040]  quality sources with other ingredients that clean out the cells that unclog
[1:59:15.040 --> 1:59:19.240]  them so all that stuff can get in viruses don't get in the good stuff gets
[1:59:19.240 --> 1:59:22.520]  in as the NIH website says that if you have all the proper things they can't
[1:59:22.520 --> 1:59:25.960]  replicate like they could but I do this because it's essential like oxygen like
[1:59:25.960 --> 1:59:30.360]  water DNA force sold out for months 50% off out of the gates triple patriot

[1:59:46.960 --> 1:59:49.760]  thank you all for tuning in
[2:00:02.240 --> 2:00:08.400]  well President Trump won by a landslide four years ago barely beat the
[2:00:08.400 --> 2:00:12.280]  fraud this time they froze the election brought in the extra ballots they've been
[2:00:12.280 --> 2:00:16.200]  caught red-handed plus I was a chat com agent so he's ill of gentlemen regardless
[2:00:16.200 --> 2:00:22.520]  but Trump just tweeted this 29 minutes ago heartwarming to see all of the we'll
[2:00:22.520 --> 2:00:27.760]  put the tweet up on screen if we can heartwarming to see all of the tremendous
[2:00:27.760 --> 2:00:33.120]  support out there especially the organic rallies that are springing up all over
[2:00:33.120 --> 2:00:38.760]  the country including the big one on Saturday in DC I may even try to stop by
[2:00:38.760 --> 2:00:45.840]  and say hello the election was rigged from Dominion all the way up and down and
[2:00:45.840 --> 2:00:50.640]  so that's good because that's why this is huge Trump is building evidence of
[2:00:50.640 --> 2:00:55.120]  fraud it's there it's incredible I can't even keep track of there so much and the
[2:00:55.120 --> 2:00:59.000]  blocking poll watchers and not certifying machines and flipping numbers I
[2:00:59.000 --> 2:01:02.480]  mean it's incredible that's why they're targeting his lawyers and threatening
[2:01:02.480 --> 2:01:07.120]  them to quit because they know they're in trouble and that's why I just keep
[2:01:07.120 --> 2:01:11.720]  like you know the Pope like oh Joe Biden's the greatest Catholic he's pro
[2:01:11.720 --> 2:01:17.960]  abortion I mean this is sick that's not a real Pope folks I mean I'm not Catholic
[2:01:17.960 --> 2:01:20.440]  but I studied the Catholic Church is very famous very important a lot of
[2:01:20.440 --> 2:01:27.880]  friends are Catholics a great work and hope John Paul the second was like 180
[2:01:27.880 --> 2:01:32.200]  degrees away from this pope he helped defeat communism he was pro-life he was
[2:01:32.200 --> 2:01:35.680]  and this this new pope runs all these pedophile rings I mean that's not a pope
[2:01:35.680 --> 2:01:41.320]  folks that is a literal imposter whatever your church has been or was this
[2:01:41.320 --> 2:01:45.160]  guy's bad and Catholics see that and and it's the same thing if your Protestant
[2:01:45.160 --> 2:01:49.080]  church is a speaking up they're bad if your university is a speaking up they're
[2:01:49.080 --> 2:01:52.760]  bad it's time for us to stop bowing to them like oh you're the liberals let me
[2:01:52.760 --> 2:01:56.480]  comply with you it's like don't say the n-word well I never said that I love
[2:01:56.480 --> 2:02:01.440]  black people everybody good don't say mother and father well why well it hurts
[2:02:01.440 --> 2:02:05.520]  people's feelings whether mother and father you see it's always like they
[2:02:05.520 --> 2:02:09.960]  get you to go oh you can't say that you're like well I don't like the KKK
[2:02:09.960 --> 2:02:14.480]  okay take their rights away now your rights are taken away it's it's very
[2:02:14.480 --> 2:02:21.480]  elementary my dear Watson as Lord event is coming up very excited I'm gonna
[2:02:21.480 --> 2:02:24.720]  interview him for a segment that I'm he's a great talk show host his own right
[2:02:24.720 --> 2:02:28.360]  the rebel media he's gonna take over for two segments and then we're gonna have
[2:02:28.360 --> 2:02:33.360]  Harrison Smith and Owen shroyer hosting from DC Harrison's back in Austin Texas
[2:02:33.360 --> 2:02:38.440]  but let's go ahead and go back to that caller who's making a really really
[2:02:38.440 --> 2:02:44.560]  important point about what's happening Todd in Texas start over some stations
[2:02:44.560 --> 2:02:51.560]  don't carry that first five-minute start over okay so what my point is is that you
[2:02:51.560 --> 2:03:00.560]  know why this is happening now is because the it's kind of like the all the
[2:03:00.560 --> 2:03:05.160]  all the chips are in and people are starting to write articles such as
[2:03:05.160 --> 2:03:11.120]  economists are on the run about Paul Krugman and the globalist economist that
[2:03:11.120 --> 2:03:16.080]  it hurt America and now they're actually Paul Krugman is admitting he's he was
[2:03:16.080 --> 2:03:21.240]  wrong and it's really absurd because he's saying that no one no one saw the
[2:03:21.240 --> 2:03:24.760]  pitfalls when we know that you've been doing it for the last 20 years that we
[2:03:24.760 --> 2:03:30.680]  all especially Ron Paul was worrying about this and now that it's kind of
[2:03:30.680 --> 2:03:35.560]  like in the Terminator when when Skynet realizing it's losing and it has to
[2:03:35.560 --> 2:03:41.760]  drop the final nail I was gonna call in back in October and ask you well there
[2:03:41.760 --> 2:03:46.240]  if they're admitting that globalism has failed what's their next move and I've
[2:03:46.240 --> 2:03:53.560]  realized this is it there is nothing after let me say this Todd never true
[2:03:53.560 --> 2:03:58.120]  words have been spoken the globalists admit they were a system that claimed
[2:03:58.120 --> 2:04:03.160]  egalitarianism freedom redistribution they hoarded everything they all made
[2:04:03.160 --> 2:04:07.000]  trillions of dollars and then they go over liberal we love black men oh a cop
[2:04:07.000 --> 2:04:10.960]  shot an innocent black guy oh let's have a you know it's a total distraction while
[2:04:10.960 --> 2:04:15.080]  they run Chinese slave camps for Christians Buddhists and Muslims and
[2:04:15.080 --> 2:04:20.360]  others so you're absolutely right this is just unprecedented and this is their
[2:04:20.360 --> 2:04:24.160]  move to devastate the economy to lock you in your house to make you scared of a
[2:04:24.160 --> 2:04:29.160]  virus so you don't think about how they created all these derivatives and sold
[2:04:29.160 --> 2:04:33.800]  mortgages hundreds of times a piece and engaged in all this fraud and are
[2:04:33.800 --> 2:04:38.560]  involved in child kidnapping and child trafficking and all and Hollywood's
[2:04:38.560 --> 2:04:42.880]  collapsing so they're collapsing they want to hide their collapse by
[2:04:42.880 --> 2:04:47.440]  collapsing us is what you're saying that's it and there's one other point I
[2:04:47.440 --> 2:04:51.040]  want to make I saw a disgusting interview between Paul Krugman and Bill
[2:04:51.040 --> 2:04:57.520]  Moyers where they had a book and it was a bunch of statistics about any
[2:04:57.520 --> 2:05:04.360]  inequality in America and Paul Krugman who you know is kind of the the
[2:05:04.360 --> 2:05:09.560]  architect of a lot of this what we saw in American globalized Paul Krugman is
[2:05:09.560 --> 2:05:15.840]  absolute demon he is blaming the iniquity that they created with their
[2:05:15.840 --> 2:05:25.320]  globalization on race I remember like five years ago the globalists were in
[2:05:25.320 --> 2:05:28.880]  the financial times and came out wiki leaks to they said we're in trouble
[2:05:28.880 --> 2:05:33.600]  everyone's on us let's just have a race war I mean so that exactly that's their
[2:05:33.600 --> 2:05:39.320]  rearguard action that's their sports earth policy let's go to chase in
[2:05:39.320 --> 2:05:44.000]  California chase thanks for holding go ahead Alex thanks for taking my call
[2:05:44.000 --> 2:05:47.640]  over there hey everybody out there you need to go support in force go get you
[2:05:47.640 --> 2:05:51.920]  some emergency food supply to protect your family or go get you a hat or a
[2:05:51.920 --> 2:05:55.080]  shirt spread the word and here's the thing that you're going to get in there
[2:05:55.080 --> 2:05:59.680]  you know Alex really cool you send in a pocket Constitution on every shipment
[2:05:59.680 --> 2:06:03.640]  and right now is one of those times where that pocket Constitution and that
[2:06:03.640 --> 2:06:07.320]  Declaration of Independence is very important when you read that declaration
[2:06:07.320 --> 2:06:11.560]  there's a long list of complaints that was the main meat potatoes of the
[2:06:11.560 --> 2:06:17.400]  Declaration and if you go to complaint number 13 it says he has combined with
[2:06:17.400 --> 2:06:21.760]  others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our Constitution and
[2:06:21.760 --> 2:06:26.320]  acknowledged by our laws giving his assent to their acts of pretended
[2:06:26.320 --> 2:06:30.400]  legislation and that is exactly one of many that are being violated again
[2:06:30.400 --> 2:06:34.280]  today but I want you guys there's a little grain of good news Alex there's
[2:06:34.280 --> 2:06:38.720]  an article been going around by Reuters saying that 80% say that Biden won the
[2:06:38.720 --> 2:06:42.240]  White House if you guys bring that article up there's another little truth
[2:06:42.240 --> 2:06:47.880]  nugget in there something that gives me hope it also says that 3% of Americans
[2:06:47.880 --> 2:06:52.440]  believe that President Trump won the election 3% of Americans are the
[2:06:52.440 --> 2:06:56.720]  original colonists that started the original revolution so everyone out
[2:06:56.720 --> 2:07:02.280]  there 3% can make a huge difference if you stand true Patriot you need to use
[2:07:02.280 --> 2:07:07.160]  this energy you need to take action locally run for city council get on to
[2:07:07.160 --> 2:07:11.040]  parlor and start a national organization because they're actually allowing free
[2:07:11.040 --> 2:07:15.640]  speech local elections I was about to say though the awakening I'm seeing now
[2:07:15.640 --> 2:07:19.800]  should shake the globalist they're very foundations that's why they're gonna
[2:07:19.800 --> 2:07:23.120]  launch everything they've got they realize this is a desperate gamble they're
[2:07:23.120 --> 2:07:27.200]  in trouble but let me be clear with you sir 3% did start the country and did
[2:07:27.200 --> 2:07:31.480]  win it you're absolutely right but man I let me tell you Trump won a landslide
[2:07:31.480 --> 2:07:36.840]  everyone I know believes Trump on black white Hispanic old young I mean it's
[2:07:36.840 --> 2:07:42.200]  like 60% support Trump everybody knew Trump was working his ass off no one
[2:07:42.200 --> 2:07:47.040]  votes for that dead zombie Biden and Kamala that had half percent support
[2:07:47.040 --> 2:07:51.200]  Democrats everyone hates them that's why the globalist chose them is there's
[2:07:51.200 --> 2:07:56.280]  such weak puppets they can control them so I think we have 60% it's just we have
[2:07:56.280 --> 2:07:59.800]  to convince ourselves that we are the majority and start not complying they
[2:07:59.800 --> 2:08:03.120]  think they've got civil disobedience how about we all start going to shut down
[2:08:03.120 --> 2:08:06.160]  Google buildings how about we start shutting down target how about we start
[2:08:06.160 --> 2:08:09.280]  shutting down all their operations that is saying kill the police how about we
[2:08:09.280 --> 2:08:13.760]  peacefully go out and block them and go to the Democrat mayor's houses and the
[2:08:13.760 --> 2:08:17.400]  legislators and just live out their yards and follow them around and never
[2:08:17.400 --> 2:08:21.240]  stop how about they get real civil disobedience on their little bullying
[2:08:21.240 --> 2:08:27.560]  asses I appreciate your call as well LeVan is about to take over he does an
[2:08:27.560 --> 2:08:32.800]  incredible job over at rebel media he's a patriot and I want to get his take on
[2:08:32.800 --> 2:08:39.240]  the Canadian lockdowns that are a model for here the FEMA camps the concentration
[2:08:39.240 --> 2:08:43.200]  camps are announcing and where this is going his take on Trump and so much more

[2:09:14.800 --> 2:09:18.560]  White House and Trump tweeted out while they were there we're going to be there
[2:09:18.560 --> 2:09:22.840]  again tonight I'm gonna go bullhorn the White House and it has an effect every
[2:09:22.840 --> 2:09:26.200]  time I bullhorn it's on the news people pick it up it's good it's so simple we're
[2:09:26.200 --> 2:09:30.040]  gonna be there we're fighting hard and Angie was telling Americans they better
[2:09:30.040 --> 2:09:35.680]  not show up screw you you commies work for George Soros and the the chai comms
[2:09:35.680 --> 2:09:39.640]  you claim you're the resistance you work for the establishment you are
[2:09:39.640 --> 2:09:46.000]  absolutely disgusting and a joke and the public sees right through everything
[2:09:46.000 --> 2:09:49.040]  you're doing we'll be right back look we all know that CNN is the epitome of
[2:09:49.040 --> 2:09:53.520]  fake news but there's a headline on their site today that says there are
[2:09:53.520 --> 2:09:57.160]  disinformation groups and organizations saying Joe Biden is not
[2:09:57.160 --> 2:10:04.280]  president-elect well on its face he's not president-elect because the votes
[2:10:04.280 --> 2:10:09.480]  have not been certified by any of the 50 states and counting is still going on
[2:10:09.480 --> 2:10:15.120]  what in seven of the states and Trump is gaining ground in all but one of them
[2:10:15.120 --> 2:10:19.640]  and then there's also going to be recounts audits and all the spot checks
[2:10:19.640 --> 2:10:25.000]  have already shown massive fraud but in comes the ace card the ace of spades
[2:10:25.000 --> 2:10:28.920]  big tech censorship is blocking not just the president not members of
[2:10:28.920 --> 2:10:33.320]  Congress but tens of millions of Americans from even sharing local news
[2:10:33.320 --> 2:10:37.760]  stations confirming the fraud this is a foreign-backed multinational takeover
[2:10:37.760 --> 2:10:42.840]  the United States Trump is battling a Chinese-backed New World Order system
[2:10:42.840 --> 2:10:46.400]  bit on keeping us locked down forever in an economic war bring us to our knees
[2:10:46.400 --> 2:10:49.680]  when President Trump said that the mainstream corporate media was the
[2:10:49.680 --> 2:10:53.280]  enemy of America he really was telling the truth they don't just work for the
[2:10:53.280 --> 2:10:57.040]  Communist Chinese and the globalist the EU and the whole Hollywood America
[2:10:57.040 --> 2:11:01.920]  hating God hating crude they literally say that they are in control of our minds
[2:11:01.920 --> 2:11:06.840]  and believe they do own us and tell us who the president is even though that's
[2:11:06.840 --> 2:11:10.360]  not in law and they're just gaslighting the whole public over and over again
[2:11:10.360 --> 2:11:14.760]  saying Joe Biden is president-elect repeating it over and over you know like
[2:11:14.760 --> 2:11:18.480]  a brainwashing mantra when it's up again to the state government to certify
[2:11:18.480 --> 2:11:21.480]  those votes most votes are being challenged there's massive evidence of
[2:11:21.480 --> 2:11:26.400]  fraud again this is so incredibly clear Biden said because he thought he was
[2:11:26.400 --> 2:11:30.160]  gonna lose up front that oh we're gonna challenge the vote no matter what
[2:11:30.160 --> 2:11:33.880]  until every votes counted well a lot of those have been counted and there's
[2:11:33.880 --> 2:11:37.440]  massive fraud being discovered so we're gonna hold the course here because Joe
[2:11:37.440 --> 2:11:41.280]  Biden is a Communist Chinese agent he's a globalist he wants carbon taxes people
[2:11:41.280 --> 2:11:45.160]  destroy this country by design to consolidate power and take control of us
[2:11:45.160 --> 2:11:47.920]  this is war
[2:11:49.840 --> 2:11:55.200]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:12:05.360 --> 2:12:10.920]  all right Esla Levant an amazing patriot up in Canada was scheduled to be on
[2:12:10.920 --> 2:12:13.600]  this this hour and I appreciate him coming on late because we got behind
[2:12:13.600 --> 2:12:17.160]  we've got more breaking news I'm gonna interview him for a minute and hand the
[2:12:17.160 --> 2:12:21.480]  baton over to him but it's being coming on the Washington Examiner and just the
[2:12:21.480 --> 2:12:26.720]  news never bet against me Trump makes first post-election comments lays out
[2:12:26.720 --> 2:12:32.400]  path to victory it's probably two weeks to three weeks to know that's what
[2:12:32.400 --> 2:12:37.000]  president Trump told the Washington Examiner report Brian York today in his
[2:12:37.000 --> 2:12:40.480]  first post-election comments on the state of the 2020 presidential election
[2:12:40.480 --> 2:12:44.800]  Trump was optimistic laying out a scenario in which he pulls out a key in
[2:12:44.800 --> 2:12:49.640]  battleground states and gets to the magic 270 votes in the electoral college
[2:12:49.640 --> 2:12:53.880]  when a win was constant the president said which lose the phone interview
[2:12:53.880 --> 2:12:59.080]  Arizona it's down to 8,000 votes yeah he keeps training to win and if we can't do
[2:12:59.080 --> 2:13:03.480]  an audit of the millions of votes we'll find 8,000 votes easily if we can do an
[2:13:03.480 --> 2:13:07.120]  audit we will be in good shape Georgia we're going to win because now we're
[2:13:07.120 --> 2:13:10.920]  going down to about 10,000-5,000 votes and we are hand counting he said
[2:13:10.920 --> 2:13:14.000]  referring to a call by Georgia Secretary of State to perform a hand count
[2:13:14.000 --> 2:13:19.800]  hand counting is the best to do a spin of the machine doesn't mean anything you
[2:13:19.800 --> 2:13:25.120]  pick up 10 votes then you hand count I think we're going to win Georgia and he
[2:13:25.120 --> 2:13:29.960]  goes on to lay out Pennsylvania Trump also was in a rosy view of North
[2:13:29.960 --> 2:13:33.560]  Carolina where he leads by more than 70,000 votes but they won't call it
[2:13:33.560 --> 2:13:36.600]  because they don't want to never win he predicts the win there unless he said
[2:13:36.600 --> 2:13:40.520]  generally they happen to find lots of votes like before when are we going to
[2:13:40.520 --> 2:13:44.240]  put in these new North Carolina when are they going to find a bunch from
[2:13:44.240 --> 2:13:48.360]  Charlotte he goes into Pennsylvania he goes into it all what's up on info wars
[2:13:48.360 --> 2:13:53.000]  calm Ezra Levant from rebel media thank you for joining us let's talk a few
[2:13:53.000 --> 2:13:57.040]  minutes about the big picture about lockdown to about Trump your smart cookie
[2:13:57.040 --> 2:14:02.880]  what is your gut telling you what is that noodle telling you Ezra well I think
[2:14:02.880 --> 2:14:07.840]  you're trying to condition Americans and the world to accept the fate of
[2:14:07.840 --> 2:14:11.800]  complete that's why they're delaying these counts that's why every you know
[2:14:11.800 --> 2:14:16.600]  when Biden himself stands in front of a made-up thing the office of the
[2:14:16.600 --> 2:14:21.360]  president-elect that's not a thing I mean you may as well so say I'm the king
[2:14:21.360 --> 2:14:25.960]  of the moon just because you put it in authoritative text on a banner behind
[2:14:25.960 --> 2:14:31.480]  you doesn't make it true that was fake news and that that image was not
[2:14:31.480 --> 2:14:36.720]  censored on Twitter or anyone you'll notice the first people around the
[2:14:36.720 --> 2:14:41.520]  world to call Biden to congratulate him were all the anti-American world leaders
[2:14:41.520 --> 2:14:46.920]  Justin Trudeau of Canada boasted about being the first because they want to
[2:14:46.920 --> 2:14:52.560]  cement it they want to project it they want anyone to give up hope that it
[2:14:52.560 --> 2:14:56.440]  would be otherwise and they want to curry favor with Biden if he actually does
[2:14:56.440 --> 2:15:00.800]  pull it off they want to disparage Trump in any way you'll notice that the
[2:15:00.800 --> 2:15:04.440]  savvier leaders like the president of Mexico president of Russia say you know
[2:15:04.440 --> 2:15:08.080]  what we'll actually wait till the things counted but all your America haters
[2:15:08.080 --> 2:15:13.920]  who like a weak America by the way countries who are against Trump they're
[2:15:13.920 --> 2:15:19.880]  not against Trump so much personally is that Trump makes America stronger it
[2:15:19.880 --> 2:15:24.680]  demands from NATO allies that they spend more it demands from other countries
[2:15:24.680 --> 2:15:28.760]  that the trade deals are fair so when you have a foreign leader cheering a
[2:15:28.760 --> 2:15:34.080]  Biden America they're actually cheering for a pushover America whether it's
[2:15:34.080 --> 2:15:39.840]  Iran or Venezuela or countries like that or China which has been exhilarated
[2:15:39.840 --> 2:15:44.360]  these last two weeks that's what's going on and the only question is will 72
[2:15:44.360 --> 2:15:50.400]  million Americans by the lie well that's right as we're coming to China saw
[2:15:50.400 --> 2:15:54.040]  their internal currency go up to all-time highs they're celebrating bragging
[2:15:54.040 --> 2:15:58.680]  quote Biden is in sync with us we own him I mean they are just celebrating this
[2:15:58.680 --> 2:16:04.840]  well and it's it's absolutely official state-run media from China the people's
[2:16:04.840 --> 2:16:11.680]  daily global times these are mouthpieces in English for propaganda to the
[2:16:11.680 --> 2:16:15.600]  outside world so these aren't just independent pundits there is no such
[2:16:15.600 --> 2:16:20.520]  thing as an independent pundit in Chinese media there so when you see the
[2:16:20.520 --> 2:16:25.680]  mockery of Trump and the cheering of Biden that is that country's
[2:16:25.680 --> 2:16:31.320]  dictatorship saying thankfully the trade battles over the skepticism of Huawei
[2:16:31.320 --> 2:16:39.720]  is over you know the pushing back against Chinese military expansionism so
[2:16:39.720 --> 2:16:44.960]  what's happening is you see in Venezuela Nicholas Maduro himself tweeted how
[2:16:44.960 --> 2:16:49.480]  excited he was to have a dialogue with Biden and Harris these people are
[2:16:49.480 --> 2:16:54.800]  telling you that if Biden actually pulls the thing off and let's be candid
[2:16:54.800 --> 2:16:58.880]  Alex there's a real chance of that I'm just saying that those who are
[2:16:58.880 --> 2:17:04.440]  assuming it's a fate of complete they're trying to undermine America I mean I
[2:17:04.440 --> 2:17:07.880]  totally agree clearly there's a lot of election fraud clearly brought in most
[2:17:07.880 --> 2:17:12.480]  later it looks like they stole it but if he's a Chinese agent Biden his son we
[2:17:12.480 --> 2:17:15.200]  heard this whole time if you're compromised you get me president well
[2:17:15.200 --> 2:17:19.240]  Russia gate was made up but China gate wow are they really gonna put this
[2:17:19.240 --> 2:17:25.520]  doddering crazy compromised puppet that brags that he got you know a billion
[2:17:25.520 --> 2:17:29.320]  bucks a Ukraine to drop investigations on a son I mean this just smells like a
[2:17:29.320 --> 2:17:34.440]  nightmare to me yeah well and that's the thing is you look at Biden and I mean
[2:17:34.440 --> 2:17:38.160]  they give him a big injection in the tush of I don't know adrenaline and
[2:17:38.160 --> 2:17:42.720]  vitamin B and he's good for half an hour an hour he actually managed not to
[2:17:42.720 --> 2:17:47.160]  stumble over himself too badly in the debates but I don't believe he's gonna
[2:17:47.160 --> 2:17:52.120]  be the de facto president I think he's gonna be more like a mascot trot him out
[2:17:52.120 --> 2:17:56.160]  there and what's curious to me and you starting to see it as he puts together
[2:17:56.160 --> 2:18:02.160]  his transition team so confidently that he's gonna win these recounts those are
[2:18:02.160 --> 2:18:06.520]  the people I think we have to scrutinize I truly don't I mean yes you're gonna
[2:18:06.520 --> 2:18:10.200]  have the Chinese connection and Hunter Biden can't believe his luck he's gonna
[2:18:10.200 --> 2:18:15.680]  be a billionaire out of this but who will actually be making the decision the
[2:18:15.680 --> 2:18:19.880]  chiefs of staff the the chiefs of staff for the different cabinet ministers
[2:18:19.880 --> 2:18:26.680]  who's in control is it the Ilhan Omar AOC wing of the party that I mean what
[2:18:26.680 --> 2:18:30.320]  Joe Biden says and does I mean half the time he doesn't even know where he is
[2:18:30.320 --> 2:18:36.000]  he is the facade like in the Wizard of the Wizard of Oz I want to see who's
[2:18:36.000 --> 2:18:42.800]  best behind the scene I totally agree with you he's the curtain and behind the
[2:18:42.800 --> 2:18:47.440]  scenes is Obama is Hillary is the Muslim Brotherhood is the chai comms is
[2:18:47.440 --> 2:18:51.360]  the Russians I mean this is just open for business there they're there I mean
[2:18:51.360 --> 2:18:55.840]  this is this is incredible it's like Biden will be the pimp and then we are
[2:18:55.840 --> 2:19:01.280]  the person that gets raped here well the last count I saw is that more than
[2:19:01.280 --> 2:19:07.240]  40 registered lobbyists have already joined the transition team with Trump
[2:19:07.240 --> 2:19:11.480]  that one of the reasons the deep state hated him was not so much that they
[2:19:11.480 --> 2:19:14.720]  disagreed with him but they didn't know how to connect with him how to schmooze
[2:19:14.720 --> 2:19:19.200]  him how to bend his arm he didn't have access points he didn't have pressure
[2:19:19.200 --> 2:19:25.060]  points you couldn't tempt him with a sexy woman with money with influence
[2:19:25.060 --> 2:19:29.420]  celebrity power he already had all those things so he was immune to the
[2:19:29.420 --> 2:19:34.520]  various traps that Hunter Biden ran into so the deep state hated Trump not
[2:19:34.520 --> 2:19:38.080]  just because they did disagree with him on things but that they couldn't interact
[2:19:38.080 --> 2:19:43.200]  with them as they had with other swamp creatures before him and perhaps after
[2:19:43.200 --> 2:19:47.800]  him so the exactly was an island under himself who really believes in America
[2:19:47.800 --> 2:19:51.800]  was fair and pragmatic believing other country sovereignty and that the
[2:19:51.800 --> 2:19:54.800]  bureaucracy didn't like the fact that they didn't have a president that they
[2:19:54.800 --> 2:19:58.640]  would come to with committees and have him agree to their policy making them the
[2:19:58.640 --> 2:20:03.360]  president they were pissed that there's actually a real president yeah you know I
[2:20:03.360 --> 2:20:07.480]  mean log rolling is the word that he can use it positively or negatively it's
[2:20:07.480 --> 2:20:12.600]  basically you do me a favor I do you a favor Trump doesn't really work that way
[2:20:12.600 --> 2:20:19.320]  and I think Washington is excited not just the Democrats but all of Washington
[2:20:19.320 --> 2:20:23.920]  every public sector bureaucrat every government union they're saying oh good
[2:20:23.920 --> 2:20:29.320]  that irritant is gone let's go back to this you know irreplaceable deep state
[2:20:29.320 --> 2:20:34.120]  that never comes and goes I think it's sad and I'm a Canadian and I'm worried
[2:20:34.120 --> 2:20:38.520]  about the effect on our country because absolutely is the founder of rebel
[2:20:38.520 --> 2:20:41.680]  media I'll tell you all about it I'm introducing next segment he takes over
[2:20:41.680 --> 2:20:44.560]  they've also got draconian lockdowns around the world and Canada is the
[2:20:44.560 --> 2:20:48.920]  epicenter coming here next wait to hear about that I get asked all the time by
[2:20:48.920 --> 2:20:53.040]  listeners and by the media what am I most proud of when it comes to show and
[2:20:53.040 --> 2:20:57.520]  it's the fact that info wars more than 25 years ago doing basic research with
[2:20:57.520 --> 2:21:01.640]  what the club of Rome and the CFR and others were actually saying develop the
[2:21:01.640 --> 2:21:05.640]  hypothesis that the communist China had been set up to take our jobs and
[2:21:05.640 --> 2:21:09.380]  transfer them to China and then make us economically destitute and position us
[2:21:09.380 --> 2:21:13.680]  into debt well now China owns the debt now China owns Hollywood all the one
[2:21:13.680 --> 2:21:17.840]  side of trading deals it turns out our analysis was absolutely dead on but
[2:21:17.840 --> 2:21:22.160]  again it wasn't that hard the CFR and others admitted what they were doing but
[2:21:22.160 --> 2:21:27.400]  still others didn't want to focus on that issue we did and you focused on it

[2:23:03.720 --> 2:23:07.320]  believe in God and I know God's real and I've experienced it in my life but even
[2:23:07.320 --> 2:23:10.880]  you don't believe in God it's important to recognize that there is goodness
[2:23:10.880 --> 2:23:14.440]  world there is evil there are people out there that want to do you harm because
[2:23:14.440 --> 2:23:19.880]  they enjoy doing bad and what I see happening across the spectrum of
[2:23:19.880 --> 2:23:24.080]  different political views is people finally get that they finally understand
[2:23:24.080 --> 2:23:29.200]  that they're not being naive anymore don't ever project your decency and your
[2:23:29.200 --> 2:23:33.520]  goodness on to other people until they've proven what they stand for and who
[2:23:33.520 --> 2:23:37.040]  they are or you're gonna get hurt but those of you out there have done your
[2:23:37.040 --> 2:23:40.600]  own research and discovered who's good and who is faithful will then come
[2:23:40.600 --> 2:23:44.440]  together with those organizations and support them like info wars is without
[2:23:44.440 --> 2:23:48.600]  your support info wars would not exist
[2:23:49.240 --> 2:23:54.600]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show

[2:24:51.760 --> 2:24:56.880]  over my pleasure great to be in the chair thanks for the trust that your
[2:24:56.880 --> 2:25:02.880]  invitation shows for me hello to Alex's viewers around the world I'm based here
[2:25:02.880 --> 2:25:08.120]  in Canada with rebel news calm but we deeply believe in freedom and we believe
[2:25:08.120 --> 2:25:11.960]  in the success of the United States although we're proud Canadians we
[2:25:11.960 --> 2:25:16.480]  understand that America is the bulwark of liberty against so many forces of
[2:25:16.480 --> 2:25:21.440]  tyranny including from China and if I may Alex just a moment ago mentioned my
[2:25:21.440 --> 2:25:28.640]  book China virus that book was not controversial there's a ton of footnotes
[2:25:28.640 --> 2:25:33.000]  in it really everything there was confirmed by legacy media mainstream
[2:25:33.000 --> 2:25:38.720]  media there were no speculative theories in him but because it contradicted quote
[2:25:38.720 --> 2:25:45.320]  official sources it was banned by amazon.com which is the number one
[2:25:45.320 --> 2:25:49.840]  bookstore in the world so I wrote the book we went to upload it as we've
[2:25:49.840 --> 2:25:54.920]  uploaded our previous 14 books we published it was rejected for two
[2:25:54.920 --> 2:25:59.320]  months they fought us claiming it contradicted official narratives that
[2:25:59.320 --> 2:26:03.800]  was the language they use official sources we tried to inquire with lawyers
[2:26:03.800 --> 2:26:08.400]  are those Canadian sources are those World Health Organization sources maybe
[2:26:08.400 --> 2:26:13.240]  those are Chinese sources what do you mean by an official source then one day
[2:26:13.240 --> 2:26:16.800]  they relented they didn't even explain why they uploaded the book to Amazon it
[2:26:16.800 --> 2:26:22.280]  went to number one in Canada and within a week they banned it again they took it
[2:26:22.280 --> 2:26:27.480]  down and gave the same explanation again it contradicted official sources it was
[2:26:27.480 --> 2:26:32.160]  down for a week they banned it and then they unbanned it again as of this moment
[2:26:32.160 --> 2:26:37.040]  it's unbanned but this goes to so many issues it goes to censorship it goes to
[2:26:37.040 --> 2:26:41.960]  the tech oligarchs that have so much control over our lives it goes to the
[2:26:41.960 --> 2:26:45.480]  fact that you're not even allowed to criticize official sources we don't
[2:26:45.480 --> 2:26:48.680]  dispute that we criticize official sources that our point of view may be
[2:26:48.680 --> 2:26:53.480]  alternative or dissident that's the whole point now Alex invited me to talk
[2:26:53.480 --> 2:26:58.880]  about some issues regarding pandemic lockdowns in Canada and the world and I
[2:26:58.880 --> 2:27:05.480]  want to show you a clip from Canada's Chief Public Health Officer our version
[2:27:05.480 --> 2:27:13.320]  of Dr. Fauci her name is Teresa Tam and she actually served on the World Health
[2:27:13.320 --> 2:27:19.440]  Organization at the same time as working as Canada's as Justin Trudeau's Chief
[2:27:19.440 --> 2:27:23.560]  Public Health Officer so which is it how can you serve two masters work for the
[2:27:23.560 --> 2:27:28.680]  UN's World Health Organization controlled by China and at the same time work for
[2:27:28.680 --> 2:27:31.400]  Justin Trudeau what if there's a contradiction what if there's a
[2:27:31.400 --> 2:27:36.520]  difference of opinion well I'll show you what Teresa Tam stands for this is a
[2:27:36.520 --> 2:27:42.520]  clip from a Canadian National Film Board documentary where Teresa Tam wasn't yet
[2:27:42.520 --> 2:27:48.000]  the Chief Public Health Officer of the country listen to her talk prospectively
[2:27:48.000 --> 2:27:53.480]  about what she would do if she ever had the chance to people who refuse to
[2:27:53.480 --> 2:27:58.520]  comply with government orders to take a government vaccine to be locked down
[2:27:58.520 --> 2:28:04.040]  take a look at this this woman is named Teresa Tam she is Canada's Chief Public
[2:28:04.040 --> 2:28:09.320]  Health Officer I think the public has to know this is one of the worst case
[2:28:09.320 --> 2:28:13.280]  scenarios in terms of an infectious disease outbreak in that their
[2:28:13.280 --> 2:28:17.880]  cooperation is sought if there are people who are non-compliant there are
[2:28:17.880 --> 2:28:25.040]  definitely laws and and public health powers that can quarantine people in
[2:28:25.040 --> 2:28:30.880]  mandatory settings it's potential you could track people put bracelets on
[2:28:30.880 --> 2:28:36.760]  their arms have police and other setups to ensure quarantine is
[2:28:36.760 --> 2:28:39.640]  undertaken
[2:28:44.800 --> 2:28:50.720]  it is better to be pre-emptive and precautionary and take the heat of people
[2:28:50.720 --> 2:28:56.560]  thinking you might be overreactionary get ahead of the curve and then think
[2:28:56.560 --> 2:29:01.920]  about whether you've overreacted later but it's such a serious situation that I
[2:29:01.920 --> 2:29:10.320]  think decisive early action is the key
[2:29:10.320 --> 2:29:14.280]  police checkpoints are set up on all the bridges and everyone leaving the city
[2:29:14.280 --> 2:29:18.960]  is required to show proof of vaccination those who refuse to cooperate
[2:29:18.960 --> 2:29:23.840]  it's almost like that was
[2:29:23.840 --> 2:29:29.400]  a plan as opposed to a hypothesis that was a documentary where Teresa Tam
[2:29:29.400 --> 2:29:34.000]  sort of brainstormed what would happen if a pandemic broke out in the Canadian
[2:29:34.000 --> 2:29:39.280]  City of Montreal and alas now she's in the position to actually action those
[2:29:39.280 --> 2:29:45.480]  items I know that info wars played this video earlier it's a Canadian
[2:29:45.480 --> 2:29:51.480]  provincial politician in our great province of Ontario and I know that
[2:29:51.480 --> 2:29:59.320]  our great province of Ontario asking about planned quarantine facilities take
[2:29:59.320 --> 2:30:02.160]  a quick look we're not going to play the whole thing but here's Randy Hill here
[2:30:02.160 --> 2:30:07.880]  asking a question and he got no answer about plans for quarantine facilities
[2:30:07.880 --> 2:30:13.960]  across Canada take a look thank you speaker my question is to the Premier
[2:30:13.960 --> 2:30:18.520]  in my supplemental question yesterday I asked this government if the people of
[2:30:18.520 --> 2:30:23.480]  Ontario should prepare for internment camps in September the federal government
[2:30:23.480 --> 2:30:28.720]  posted a call for expressions of interest for contractors to supply provide
[2:30:28.720 --> 2:30:34.360]  and manage quarantine isolation camps throughout every province and every
[2:30:34.360 --> 2:30:41.400]  territory in Canada these quarantine isolation camps however are not limited
[2:30:41.400 --> 2:30:49.320]  to people with COVID but provide a wide latitude for many people to be detained
[2:30:49.320 --> 2:30:54.560]  surely this government is aware of the intentions to build these isolation
[2:30:54.560 --> 2:30:59.240]  camps from coast to coast and my question to the Premier is how many of these
[2:30:59.240 --> 2:31:03.560]  camps will be built and how many people does this government expect to
[2:31:03.560 --> 2:31:10.320]  question government host leader thank you thank you mr. Speaker it is very true
[2:31:10.320 --> 2:31:14.040]  that when people leave the country and when they come back in that the the
[2:31:14.040 --> 2:31:16.960]  province is suggesting and in the federal government cooperation with
[2:31:16.960 --> 2:31:21.080]  federal government we're suggesting that people isolate themselves that has
[2:31:21.080 --> 2:31:24.040]  been a practice that has been very successful not only here in the province
[2:31:24.040 --> 2:31:28.360]  of Ontario but across across Canada and we will of course be redoubling our
[2:31:28.360 --> 2:31:32.520]  efforts to make sure that the people of the province of Ontario remain safe
[2:31:32.520 --> 2:31:37.320]  mr. Speaker so if the member is referring to the fact that that one of
[2:31:37.320 --> 2:31:40.640]  the public health policies is that when you return from a jurisdiction outside
[2:31:40.640 --> 2:31:44.040]  of the province of Ontario or from another country that you isolate yourself
[2:31:44.040 --> 2:31:49.040]  for for two weeks I would suggest that that has been a good a good policy that
[2:31:49.040 --> 2:31:51.960]  has been working in fact this house has been doing the same thing since we came
[2:31:51.960 --> 2:31:55.800]  back we are working in cohorts to make sure that the legislative assembly can
[2:31:55.800 --> 2:31:59.960]  continue to operate that's why we have two separate cohorts the answer was
[2:31:59.960 --> 2:32:03.320]  about coming in from foreign countries and there's a quarantine but let me show
[2:32:03.320 --> 2:32:09.040]  you the actual document this is called a request for information put out by
[2:32:09.040 --> 2:32:14.320]  Canada's public works agency so this is a document published by the Trudeau
[2:32:14.320 --> 2:32:19.160]  government of Canada asking private contractors so if you run a hotel if
[2:32:19.160 --> 2:32:23.600]  you're a private prison contractor anyone in the private sector this was a
[2:32:23.600 --> 2:32:29.920]  document put up on the official government website calling for not bids at
[2:32:29.920 --> 2:32:34.960]  this phase but for ideas brainstorming they called it a crew request for
[2:32:34.960 --> 2:32:39.920]  information and let me read a little bit from paragraph C where they talk about
[2:32:39.920 --> 2:32:44.800]  background if you can see that there I just want to read one sentence from about
[2:32:44.800 --> 2:32:51.680]  two-thirds of the way down the sentence says over time the use of the
[2:32:51.680 --> 2:32:58.000]  designated quarantine sites DQS maybe temporarily discontinued until needed
[2:32:58.000 --> 2:33:06.040]  again by the government of Canada or may be used for other requirements so these
[2:33:06.040 --> 2:33:10.280]  could be just for people who are coming in from a foreign country and have to
[2:33:10.280 --> 2:33:15.000]  quarantine for a couple weeks or they could be used for other requirements
[2:33:15.000 --> 2:33:20.080]  let me read just one more sentence in before we go to a break in anticipation
[2:33:20.080 --> 2:33:25.560]  of a possible continued need for quarantine sites over the next one to
[2:33:25.560 --> 2:33:33.560]  two years so these quarantine sites aren't temporary they could be here for
[2:33:33.560 --> 2:33:40.440]  years to come we have to take a short break now but when we come back I want
[2:33:40.440 --> 2:33:45.600]  to show you how this public health mandate is being used to censor and
[2:33:45.600 --> 2:33:49.680]  it's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with one of our most

[2:34:49.240 --> 2:34:55.120]  Obama all of them said we are not gonna concede if there's a red mirage we
[2:34:55.120 --> 2:34:57.640]  believe it's gonna look like Trump's gonna win a landslide if they had the
[2:34:57.640 --> 2:35:02.480]  internal polls and indeed Trump won most of the states he won last time by an
[2:35:02.480 --> 2:35:07.520]  even bigger margin and we was set to win the other ones they froze the seven
[2:35:07.520 --> 2:35:12.560]  states on election night and then they brought in all of the reserve ballots
[2:35:12.560 --> 2:35:15.720]  they had this is completely transparent so when they say that he is president
[2:35:15.720 --> 2:35:19.280]  elect he's not Trump has not conceded none of the states have certified the
[2:35:19.280 --> 2:35:22.960]  vote and now all these investigations have been opened up and avalanches
[2:35:22.960 --> 2:35:27.840]  mountains oceans of election fraud has come out and already been documented in

[2:35:32.040 --> 2:35:35.680]  gentlemen the fix is in they've run bigger and bigger hoaxes every time

[2:35:39.960 --> 2:35:42.920]  get away with this it's the end of America as we know it we will be

[2:38:52.520 --> 2:38:56.280]  information wasn't a request for a proposal it was a request for information
[2:38:56.280 --> 2:39:01.240]  they wanted big ideas from the private sector for building and running these
[2:39:01.240 --> 2:39:07.480]  quarantine facilities they were described as a place for quarantining
[2:39:07.480 --> 2:39:14.320]  travelers but for other purposes too used for other requirements and most
[2:39:14.320 --> 2:39:19.920]  ominously but this would continue for one or two years
[2:39:20.480 --> 2:39:24.720]  well we're based here in Canada we've a lot of American viewers but we also have
[2:39:24.720 --> 2:39:29.440]  a very powerful journalist in Australia maybe you've heard of him his name is
[2:39:29.440 --> 2:39:34.000]  Avi Yamini and he's done outstanding journalism there I'll get to Avi in a
[2:39:34.000 --> 2:39:37.800]  moment but first I want to show you if you think things are bad in America and
[2:39:37.800 --> 2:39:43.480]  I tell you they're worse in many ways in Canada and Europe the UK's gone nuts but
[2:39:43.480 --> 2:39:47.040]  let me show you a minister in the Australian government this was in
[2:39:47.040 --> 2:39:53.880]  August I believe talking about what they would do if they got a vaccine and they
[2:39:53.880 --> 2:39:59.160]  were talking about a made in China vaccine hastily rushed to market listen
[2:39:59.160 --> 2:40:07.200]  to the phrase no jab no pay take a listen to this have absolutely no doubt
[2:40:07.200 --> 2:40:13.480]  about that but there will be strong you know them I suspect the majority of
[2:40:13.480 --> 2:40:18.640]  Australians will get vaccinated and then there will be a strong public view that
[2:40:18.640 --> 2:40:27.400]  those who choose not to get vaccinated need to there needs to be some sort of
[2:40:27.400 --> 2:40:33.040]  incentive stick perhaps through the current programs including no jab no pay
[2:40:33.040 --> 2:40:39.680]  to to make that happen so I think that is a very reasonable interpretation of
[2:40:39.680 --> 2:40:46.280]  what the PM had to say today again looking at specific things like not
[2:40:46.280 --> 2:40:51.560]  being able to go into restaurants not being able to travel internationally not
[2:40:51.560 --> 2:40:56.400]  did you hear that and he used the phrase no jab no pay I've also heard in
[2:40:56.400 --> 2:41:01.480]  Australia no jab no play that kids would not be allowed to go to school to
[2:41:01.480 --> 2:41:05.520]  join sports leagues to go to clubs but I've watched that clip about four times
[2:41:05.520 --> 2:41:13.280]  every time he says no jab no pay a jab that means taking the vaccine no going
[2:41:13.280 --> 2:41:20.160]  to a restaurant no travel and how would all this be tracked why it's by the same
[2:41:20.160 --> 2:41:24.040]  source is where the vaccine in that case would come from from China China's
[2:41:24.040 --> 2:41:28.400]  social credit system they're getting you conditioned to using the apps these
[2:41:28.400 --> 2:41:33.120]  tracing apps these warning apps just go on the app we promise your privacy is
[2:41:33.120 --> 2:41:39.000]  protected we only have a few minutes left in the show before I hand it over to
[2:41:39.000 --> 2:41:44.040]  Nick baggage will take over the top of the hour but I told you that I'm in
[2:41:44.040 --> 2:41:48.520]  Canada and rebel news comm is the name of our company but we're in America we're
[2:41:48.520 --> 2:41:52.320]  in Canada in the UK we've got a journalist in Australia you've probably
[2:41:52.320 --> 2:41:56.400]  seen him on the internet he fights like hell and I just showed you that clip of
[2:41:56.400 --> 2:42:01.640]  the Australian cabinet minister saying Australians should get used to the idea
[2:42:01.640 --> 2:42:05.160]  of no jab no pay you can't go to restaurant you can't travel but it's
[2:42:05.160 --> 2:42:09.880]  voluntary vaccine mind you I'll be a meanie our reporter down under has been
[2:42:09.880 --> 2:42:13.800]  covering the lockdowns there and in the Australian state of Victoria they've
[2:42:13.800 --> 2:42:18.920]  had the strictest lockdowns in the world even stricter than China police
[2:42:18.920 --> 2:42:22.560]  checkpoints on the road fines for being more than five kilometers from your
[2:42:22.560 --> 2:42:28.200]  house curfews of course permits to go out obviously been personally assaulted
[2:42:28.200 --> 2:42:33.800]  by police he's suing police right now for a false arrest and assault so that
[2:42:33.800 --> 2:42:39.320]  was covering the pandemic protests the anti-lockdown protests but there was a
[2:42:39.320 --> 2:42:44.720]  global warming protests just last week in Australia and like the black lives
[2:42:44.720 --> 2:42:49.800]  matter protests earlier this summer the police couldn't be happier about it they
[2:42:49.800 --> 2:42:54.160]  were rolling out the red carpet for black lives matter protests and global
[2:42:54.160 --> 2:42:58.440]  warming protests but I'll be a meanie one of our journalists who has been
[2:42:58.440 --> 2:43:06.160]  skeptical of the lockdown I want you to see how using the powers of the pandemic
[2:43:06.160 --> 2:43:11.280]  lockdown using the health emergency in Australia which is one of the freest
[2:43:11.280 --> 2:43:16.360]  countries in the world they went after our reporter we won't watch the whole
[2:43:16.360 --> 2:43:20.480]  clip but let's watch a good few minutes of this take a look

[2:45:59.200 --> 2:46:05.080]  peaceful protests but today for some reason there's a big police presence and
[2:46:05.080 --> 2:46:08.720]  there are some protesters that set up a stand
[2:46:09.280 --> 2:46:14.480]  suddenly COVID is fine the problem is over your mini is outside of these 25
[2:46:14.480 --> 2:46:20.320]  kilometers we better jail him I think that's a good idea I need to fill out

[2:46:35.360 --> 2:46:40.480]  that's our reporter Ari Yamini the police know who he is he's suing those
[2:46:40.480 --> 2:46:46.480]  police for arresting him throwing him to the ground at a previous pandemic rally
[2:46:46.480 --> 2:46:49.720]  by the way he's not a protester he's a journalist as you can see did you see
[2:46:49.720 --> 2:46:55.160]  the hassle and I don't know if you heard those key words I have my permit I have
[2:46:55.160 --> 2:47:01.560]  my press pass the kind of paperwork and rules and red tape you heard he
[2:47:01.560 --> 2:47:06.640]  mentioned 25 kilometers they recently really used to be a five kilometer from
[2:47:06.640 --> 2:47:11.240]  your house rule now it's 25 kilometers there's not a single case of the virus
[2:47:11.240 --> 2:47:15.480]  in the entire Australian state of Victoria it's about six and a half
[2:47:15.480 --> 2:47:19.840]  million people that the main city of Melbourne it's not a single case and did
[2:47:19.840 --> 2:47:23.000]  you see what those police were doing they didn't like Avi he's been a burr
[2:47:23.000 --> 2:47:28.160]  under their saddle in a pain in their neck and so where's your papers your
[2:47:28.160 --> 2:47:32.920]  papers he they interrupted him he was interviewing someone at this global
[2:47:32.920 --> 2:47:37.800]  warming rally but they honed in on him and what gives them that power what
[2:47:37.800 --> 2:47:43.120]  gives him that right the pandemic obviously but we have to do it it's an
[2:47:43.120 --> 2:47:46.920]  emergency look at that he was interviewing that man and they just
[2:47:46.920 --> 2:47:50.840]  came right in and said show us your papers and they knocked him off his
[2:47:50.840 --> 2:47:55.960]  course for 10 minutes there and they and I don't know if you heard that one cop
[2:47:55.960 --> 2:48:01.280]  said I'm gonna ask you to leave the implication being if you don't leave
[2:48:01.280 --> 2:48:05.640]  you'll be arrested now we're suing them on behalf of Avi and I think we're gonna
[2:48:05.640 --> 2:48:10.920]  win I've only got a few seconds left here today it's been a pleasure being with
[2:48:10.920 --> 2:48:15.400]  you telling you a little bit of what's going on in Canada and Australia if you
[2:48:15.400 --> 2:48:20.720]  want to learn more go to our website rebel news.com you can see I mean
[2:48:20.720 --> 2:48:25.080]  there's a story right there a great story about a conservative MP who is for
[2:48:25.080 --> 2:48:29.440]  the lockdown so all the bars in this city abandoned for life I love that
[2:48:29.440 --> 2:48:34.560]  story all right it's time for me to say goodbye up next is Nick Begich go to
[2:48:34.560 --> 2:48:37.720]  rebelnews.com and take a look around here with an important message all of
[2:48:37.720 --> 2:48:40.080]  our listeners and viewers I want to thank you for your support over the years I
[2:48:40.080 --> 2:48:44.160]  want to thank you for having skin in the game and no one has had more skin in the
[2:48:44.160 --> 2:48:48.760]  game than our president and he needs our prayers he needs our support he is the
[2:48:48.760 --> 2:48:52.360]  president secretary of state Pompeo understands that's why he said yesterday
[2:48:52.360 --> 2:48:57.040]  there will be a smooth transition from this Trump administration into the next
[2:48:57.040 --> 2:49:02.280]  administration because in all the major states where they're still counting they
[2:49:02.280 --> 2:49:06.440]  are gaining ground that is President Trump Republican Party the American
[2:49:06.440 --> 2:49:10.080]  people the populace the Patriots the enemy the Democrats backed by the
[2:49:10.080 --> 2:49:13.800]  chai comms backed by the European Union backed by Hollywood backed by the left
[2:49:13.800 --> 2:49:18.680]  the blue cities the blue states they are in a rage trying to gaslight us keep
[2:49:18.680 --> 2:49:23.560]  calling Biden president elect he's not president has to concede and or all of
[2:49:23.560 --> 2:49:27.000]  the states have to certify the vote which hasn't happened yet and then you have
[2:49:27.000 --> 2:49:31.360]  to have the electors seek who is going to be the president and this may be a
[2:49:31.360 --> 2:49:34.440]  dispute that goes back to the states that's why it's in the Constitution and
[2:49:34.440 --> 2:49:41.440]  the Constitution's kicking in it's all on record Yale Harvard Princeton
[2:49:41.440 --> 2:49:47.360]  Stanford they were all hired a year ago and then again six months ago to war
[2:49:47.360 --> 2:49:51.920]  game how to get the public to stay locked down during a pandemic and how to
[2:49:51.920 --> 2:49:56.000]  get the public to take inoculations and they talk about calling people heroes
[2:49:56.000 --> 2:49:59.880]  that do it they talk about shaming those that don't this is all been
[2:49:59.880 --> 2:50:04.720]  psychologically tested it's all been psychologically prepared and once they
[2:50:04.720 --> 2:50:08.760]  get a lockdown for 15 days you notice now they say it's permanent that's how
[2:50:08.760 --> 2:50:13.400]  it works oh just put these handcuffs on the serial killer says the woman in the
[2:50:13.400 --> 2:50:18.080]  parking lot everything will be alright no now we've already put the handcuffs on
[2:50:18.080 --> 2:50:23.600]  and we're in the serial killer's van he's taking us to his shack in the woods
[2:50:23.600 --> 2:50:27.680]  to slowly torture us to death that's the allegory we got a bust out of this
[2:50:27.680 --> 2:50:31.160]  thing now we got to say no now we got to make a run for it now what we still
[2:50:31.160 --> 2:50:35.160]  can't once he gets us in that base but it's gonna get a lot a lot worse folks
[2:50:35.160 --> 2:50:38.280]  so stop submitting
[2:50:38.280 --> 2:50:51.320]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:50:51.320 --> 2:51:09.480]  and welcome welcome back to the fourth hour and it's interesting you know
[2:51:09.480 --> 2:51:16.160]  here in Alaska today we're on the third Friday the 13th 2020 and just before
[2:51:16.160 --> 2:51:22.480]  noon here snows on the ground it's cold again it's dark again we're back to
[2:51:22.480 --> 2:51:28.880]  winter and you know kind of the backdrop of the nation right now a little gloomy
[2:51:28.880 --> 2:51:37.760]  a little dark a little bit cold really what a mess the last couple of weeks have
[2:51:37.760 --> 2:51:43.120]  been talking about the last hour and listening to a lot of the commentary
[2:51:43.120 --> 2:51:49.720]  about China and kind of how this all goes and what rolls out in Canada in
[2:51:49.720 --> 2:51:57.040]  terms of perceived next steps and man it looks more like China every day doesn't
[2:51:57.040 --> 2:52:02.800]  it but we give it different names you know it's so so bizarre and I was talking
[2:52:02.800 --> 2:52:08.360]  last week about this book unrestricted warfare and this is written by two
[2:52:08.360 --> 2:52:14.440]  Chinese kernels that was written late 90s so it's you know it's 20 years dated
[2:52:14.440 --> 2:52:19.320]  and and why I want to talk about this is because we're in that war you see it
[2:52:19.320 --> 2:52:24.800]  started in the late 90s and the Chinese announced it and it involved a lot of
[2:52:24.800 --> 2:52:29.280]  different aspects and I'm going to get into those aspects over the next hour
[2:52:29.280 --> 2:52:34.560]  because none of them had anything to do with the old concepts of war you know
[2:52:34.560 --> 2:52:41.000]  tanks bullets bombs and see I've been talking about this for 25 years as long
[2:52:41.000 --> 2:52:46.400]  as the Chinese have as a matter of fact and because we could read the literature
[2:52:46.400 --> 2:52:51.600]  what was in the open literature then and pretty clearly conclude where we were
[2:52:51.600 --> 2:52:59.880]  headed now and so now all these reports come out as if oh my gosh what are we
[2:52:59.880 --> 2:53:05.240]  gonna do well it's been going on a long time and for wars have been talking
[2:53:05.240 --> 2:53:10.440]  about this for a long time we've been talking about this for a very long time
[2:53:10.440 --> 2:53:13.960]  let's talk about what some of the aspects of unrestricted warfare might look
[2:53:13.960 --> 2:53:20.840]  like how about a drug war you're not the one that we've been seeing but the one
[2:53:20.840 --> 2:53:26.080]  mentioned here the drug war the Chinese mention is a war where they
[2:53:26.080 --> 2:53:35.520]  introduce drugs that damage a population you know like fentanyl like things
[2:53:35.520 --> 2:53:40.440]  that you're expecting to be safe like baby formula you know these kinds of
[2:53:40.440 --> 2:53:46.120]  things were a little contamination here a little contamination there and then
[2:53:46.120 --> 2:53:51.560]  something even more direct how about just find a way to get that fentanyl in
[2:53:51.560 --> 2:53:55.520]  they would bring it through Mexico through the drug cartels there because
[2:53:55.520 --> 2:53:59.360]  they're always looking for new arrangements but you have to start
[2:53:59.360 --> 2:54:03.280]  thinking about this in a very different way unrestricted warfare the book
[2:54:03.280 --> 2:54:07.680]  covers on the screen for those that can see it but here's the thing about all
[2:54:07.680 --> 2:54:12.080]  that let's talk about the drug war a little bit more think that might be
[2:54:12.080 --> 2:54:17.320]  happening in the United States hmm the source of a lot of this fentanyl
[2:54:17.320 --> 2:54:26.480]  killing thousands of Americans hmm hmm sounds to me like a weaponized system
[2:54:26.480 --> 2:54:33.160]  right and here's what this book says it says everything let me say that again
[2:54:33.160 --> 2:54:40.520]  everything can be a weapon in the 21st century in the way the Chinese play it
[2:54:40.520 --> 2:54:47.240]  and they don't make bones about it they write about it publish it freely
[2:54:47.240 --> 2:54:52.760]  circulate it and then their friends in the West give it a new package a new
[2:54:52.760 --> 2:54:59.120]  narrative a new bunch of words to describe something that's still who
[2:54:59.120 --> 2:55:07.880]  garbage junk you know not at all what is interesting and useful to living
[2:55:07.880 --> 2:55:15.000]  thriving souls but what's really convenient for crushing the West let's
[2:55:15.000 --> 2:55:20.040]  talk about some of the other things how about financial war they're gonna talk
[2:55:20.040 --> 2:55:26.080]  about financial war we're gonna talk about how about information war from
[2:55:26.080 --> 2:55:31.400]  the Chinese perspective entertainment news coverage taking over the networks
[2:55:31.400 --> 2:55:36.640]  you think that's happening hey let's get into this today let's talk about the
[2:55:36.640 --> 2:55:41.120]  chai comms real moves and their allies in the new world order this dr. Nick
[2:55:41.120 --> 2:56:08.200]  baggage will be right back America is in crisis emergency lockdown to is coming
[2:56:08.200 --> 2:56:18.200]  from the U.S. economy and so many other amazing products these are changing
[2:56:18.200 --> 2:56:23.360]  things these are things that are absolutely elemental to what you and
[2:56:23.360 --> 2:56:27.560]  your body have to have to live but regardless buying these products from

[2:56:34.360 --> 2:56:37.600]  the products that for store.com today because without you won't be on the
[2:56:37.600 --> 2:56:41.040]  air again I salute you thank you all the toll free numbers triple eight two five
[2:56:41.040 --> 2:56:56.120]  three three one three nine please take action today in our emergency cell you're
[2:56:56.120 --> 2:57:06.240]  listening to the Alex Jones show with Nick baggage and welcome back you know
[2:57:06.240 --> 2:57:10.200]  I'm thinking about unrestricted warfare and just before the break we're talking
[2:57:10.200 --> 2:57:15.640]  about the concept of financial war now think about it and in this text it also
[2:57:15.640 --> 2:57:20.800]  talks about Soros and what he was doing in the 90s in terms of crushing
[2:57:20.800 --> 2:57:26.400]  economies financially as a non-state actor okay at least officially a non-state
[2:57:26.400 --> 2:57:32.360]  actor okay but here's something to consider about non-state actors when
[2:57:32.360 --> 2:57:38.000]  when governments find a friendly actor that has some capacity they like to
[2:57:38.000 --> 2:57:42.520]  corrupt them they like to actually own them because think about this a modern
[2:57:42.520 --> 2:57:48.160]  bomber might cost you two three billion dollars just one just one bomber and for
[2:57:48.160 --> 2:57:52.960]  a fraction of the price you too can bribe and corrupt hundreds of government
[2:57:52.960 --> 2:57:58.360]  officials you know so this is what really goes on with deep state it's about
[2:57:58.360 --> 2:58:01.640]  not just government for private companies whoever you can corrupt that
[2:58:01.640 --> 2:58:06.640]  will serve your bidding you see this is one of the methods and unrestricted
[2:58:06.640 --> 2:58:11.720]  warfare okay financial warfare now I talked a little bit about Soros but how
[2:58:11.720 --> 2:58:20.440]  about the Chinese they own the banks that gave oh excuse me set up Hunter Bart
[2:58:20.440 --> 2:58:25.760]  Biden and if you've watched the videos would you guys want this guy managing
[2:58:25.760 --> 2:58:31.600]  anything for you any of your money at all this guy mr. unreliable would you
[2:58:31.600 --> 2:58:37.280]  want that happening with your billion and a half dollars less than the price of
[2:58:37.280 --> 2:58:41.800]  a bomber you get Biden and all of his context think of his rolodex that ran
[2:58:41.800 --> 2:58:47.640]  through the news right all the major players so you come in under the radar
[2:58:47.640 --> 2:58:53.080]  screen corrupt a few people on the pier peripheral and then dive on in and start
[2:58:53.080 --> 2:58:58.320]  picking the low-hanging fruit and work your way up to the top branches this is
[2:58:58.320 --> 2:59:02.960]  what is done in unrestricted warfare financial warfare think about this
[2:59:02.960 --> 2:59:07.200]  these guys went from riding bicycles all around Beijing there's even a song
[2:59:07.200 --> 2:59:13.000]  about you know about bicycles in Beijing you know because that's what we saw in
[2:59:13.000 --> 2:59:21.360]  1971 was a bunch of bicycles now no one's laughing no one's joking anymore
[2:59:21.360 --> 2:59:26.200]  because we all did it you me and everyone else that consumed every little
[2:59:26.200 --> 2:59:29.960]  Chinese widget and piece of garbage because there was nothing else on the
[2:59:29.960 --> 2:59:36.360]  market so we they made sure this pipeline of money through consumption flowed
[2:59:36.360 --> 2:59:40.960]  right into China but you know consumption kind of came to a reaching
[2:59:40.960 --> 2:59:46.200]  halt right not happening right now a lot of people kind of holding back except the
[2:59:46.200 --> 2:59:50.600]  financial sector which is disconnected from the real world and went in to
[2:59:50.600 --> 2:59:55.320]  financial illusion this is a financial war ladies and gentlemen and it has a
[2:59:55.320 --> 3:00:01.680]  design and a purpose and it's intended to grab us by the private parts and
[3:00:01.680 --> 3:00:07.480]  drag us through the streets of China only it's everywhere now because this is
[3:00:07.480 --> 3:00:16.960]  how it works you're in the digital gulag already wake up time to wake up
[3:00:16.960 --> 3:00:24.880]  time to wake up because the game is afoot and has been played out a long
[3:00:24.880 --> 3:00:29.040]  time think about financial work think about the Chinese acquiring all these
[3:00:29.040 --> 3:00:33.960]  treasuries and suck them all up and grabbing all these dollars and then
[3:00:33.960 --> 3:00:37.720]  everyone goes then they what are they doing with those dollars well they're
[3:00:37.720 --> 3:00:42.880]  playing part of the financial war which is grabbing everybody else's stuff and
[3:00:42.880 --> 3:00:47.800]  instead of going over there and just taking it you pay for it you give them
[3:00:47.800 --> 3:00:53.480]  fiat you know and they're grabbing fiat grabbing all the currency they can and
[3:00:53.480 --> 3:00:57.880]  then they're buying assets real stuff with that all over the world and they're
[3:00:57.880 --> 3:01:01.600]  outbidding American companies and European companies we're going they're
[3:01:01.600 --> 3:01:07.880]  crazy to pay those kind of prices they're crazy but no they're not because
[3:01:07.880 --> 3:01:10.600]  they take a long view they're not thinking about the next quarter thing
[3:01:10.600 --> 3:01:17.800]  about the next century the next century you see the long game and the long game
[3:01:17.800 --> 3:01:26.800]  says you buy up all the chips for an aid as a concept for warfare Chinese spell
[3:01:26.800 --> 3:01:31.800]  it out in that same book you know for an aid way to come on in and be your
[3:01:31.800 --> 3:01:35.760]  friends as a grab you again from those private parts to drag you through the
[3:01:35.760 --> 3:01:42.400]  streets only now you're smiling about it because your cash registers full until
[3:01:42.400 --> 3:01:47.200]  the game is afoot again and they decide to just take your stuff so that black
[3:01:47.200 --> 3:01:51.840]  male do they've got your Swiss account you know all wired in you know this is
[3:01:51.840 --> 3:02:00.920]  how it really works they have no restrictions there are no rules okay let
[3:02:00.920 --> 3:02:08.680]  me say that again there are no rules hey this is how it is actually playing out
[3:02:08.680 --> 3:02:14.720]  that's why America can torture people and kidnap people and extort people we
[3:02:14.720 --> 3:02:20.840]  do that too you see because there are no rules we have the illusion of rulemaking
[3:02:20.840 --> 3:02:27.000]  and this is also part of a warfare front identified by the Chinese non-state
[3:02:27.000 --> 3:02:32.000]  actors and regulatory body like the United Nations like the World Health
[3:02:32.000 --> 3:02:40.360]  Organization like the World Monetary Fund these organizations the Chinese
[3:02:40.360 --> 3:02:46.200]  have a deliberate mission to corrupt them and use them and remember nobody
[3:02:46.200 --> 3:02:55.080]  voted for any of these people no one voted for any of them and everything
[3:02:55.080 --> 3:03:00.480]  being equal right do you want a billion Chinese because if it was a
[3:03:00.480 --> 3:03:07.480]  democratic world after all they would decide right a lot more than they do
[3:03:07.480 --> 3:03:11.760]  this out of co okay with you it's not okay with me within the sovereign
[3:03:11.760 --> 3:03:16.560]  boundaries of this country it is not okay with one of the other fronts is
[3:03:16.560 --> 3:03:20.600]  just information generally and how do they come into that information well
[3:03:20.600 --> 3:03:25.080]  they can't own the news media as foreign actors in and not being clearly
[3:03:25.080 --> 3:03:29.160]  identified but they can only entertainment industry maybe a chunk of the
[3:03:29.160 --> 3:03:34.960]  textbook industry you know the intellectual property industry that
[3:03:34.960 --> 3:03:40.120]  begins to frame the way future generations see the world through the
[3:03:40.120 --> 3:03:49.080]  illusion of the window of the world TV right the screen the propaganda tool of
[3:03:49.080 --> 3:03:56.440]  the 21st century it's either to educate or manipulate that's all it's for
[3:03:56.440 --> 3:04:03.600]  educate or manipulate that's it the games of manipulation are obvious it's
[3:04:03.600 --> 3:04:09.760]  charge you up take the vacuum out of your brain keep the messages simple and
[3:04:09.760 --> 3:04:12.840]  get you to start repeating them even if you don't believe through political
[3:04:12.840 --> 3:04:17.480]  correctness shut down the consciousness this is also simply
[3:04:17.480 --> 3:04:23.640]  orchestrated if you generate fear anxiety all of those things you shut down
[3:04:23.640 --> 3:04:27.600]  higher-order thinking keep the messaging simple get the sheep to move like a
[3:04:27.600 --> 3:04:33.600]  herd and man you can push them around any way you want whether you live in
[3:04:33.600 --> 3:04:37.880]  China whether you live in central Europe or whether you live in the
[3:04:37.880 --> 3:04:43.200]  wonderful USA or our friends in Canada as we've been hearing in the last hour
[3:04:43.200 --> 3:04:48.240]  what's about to happen to them I've talked to some of my friends in Canada
[3:04:48.240 --> 3:04:53.640]  recently in the last week now one of my good friends who's used to traveling a
[3:04:53.640 --> 3:04:58.000]  lot internationally as part of his normal life has been locked down since
[3:04:58.000 --> 3:05:03.200]  March and I'm listening to the conversation and there's way too much
[3:05:03.200 --> 3:05:09.160]  acceptance as this is okay and I don't like that part of okay I think these
[3:05:09.160 --> 3:05:12.720]  challenges moving up to the Supreme Court eventually about what is
[3:05:12.720 --> 3:05:17.440]  appropriate in terms of personal liberty and freedom within the context of the
[3:05:17.440 --> 3:05:23.600]  21st century with the context of maybe a Chinese virus which also is part of
[3:05:23.600 --> 3:05:28.360]  the program right if you can use this the first time we all thought about you
[3:05:28.360 --> 3:05:32.880]  know biological weapons was when we handed off blankets to Indians right to
[3:05:32.880 --> 3:05:39.360]  indigenous people we handed off blankets with smallpox now we wiped out
[3:05:39.360 --> 3:05:46.160]  thousands maybe millions even with some of that so this isn't really anything
[3:05:46.160 --> 3:05:52.520]  new it's just got a new framework a new narrative surrounding it makes everyone
[3:05:52.520 --> 3:05:57.200]  feel good being in jail we're all under house arrest right now in case you
[3:05:57.200 --> 3:06:05.160]  haven't noticed that's what this is actually house arrest oh and the
[3:06:05.160 --> 3:06:10.840]  Deutsche Bank what they want to do now in Europe is tax Europeans five percent
[3:06:10.840 --> 3:06:14.320]  for staying at home and working out of your home because it costs you less
[3:06:14.320 --> 3:06:19.120]  money you don't have to commute by lunch all those things so they want you to
[3:06:19.120 --> 3:06:23.160]  pay a five percent day-at-home tax so now they're gonna put you under house
[3:06:23.160 --> 3:06:27.800]  arrest and you're gonna pay for this is the new world Lord ladies and gentlemen
[3:06:27.800 --> 3:06:32.720]  welcome to the 21st century but we still have time the hour is late but the
[3:06:32.720 --> 3:06:37.360]  hour is not gone this is dr. Nick Beggett we'll be right back
[3:06:41.920 --> 3:06:46.520]  look we all know that CNN is the epitome of fake news but there's a headline on
[3:06:46.520 --> 3:06:51.560]  their site today that says there are disinformation groups and organizations
[3:06:51.560 --> 3:06:57.560]  saying Joe Biden is not president-elect well on its face he's not
[3:06:57.560 --> 3:07:02.960]  president-elect because the votes have not been certified by any of the 50
[3:07:02.960 --> 3:07:07.960]  states and counting is still going on what in seven of the states and Trump
[3:07:07.960 --> 3:07:12.800]  is gaining ground in all but one of them and then there's also going to be
[3:07:12.800 --> 3:07:19.320]  recounts audits and all the spot checks are shown NASA fraud but in comes the
[3:07:19.320 --> 3:07:23.600]  ace card the ace of spades big tech censorship is blocking not just the
[3:07:23.600 --> 3:07:27.880]  president not just members of Congress but tens of millions of Americans from
[3:07:27.880 --> 3:07:32.000]  even sharing local news stations confirming the fraud this is a foreign
[3:07:32.000 --> 3:07:36.240]  backed multinational takeover the United States Trump is battling a Chinese
[3:07:36.240 --> 3:07:40.800]  backed New World Order system fit on keeping us locked out forever in an
[3:07:40.800 --> 3:07:44.200]  economic war and bring us to our knees you know something very sad it's
[3:07:44.200 --> 3:07:47.480]  happening it's very sad because it was all avoidable two and a half years ago
[3:07:47.480 --> 3:07:51.720]  when info wars got banned off of more than 60 major platforms I warned
[3:07:51.720 --> 3:07:55.880]  everybody that was a precedent for the upcoming presidential election and that
[3:07:55.880 --> 3:08:00.840]  they would continue to ratchet down and tighten down the censorship until
[3:08:00.840 --> 3:08:05.240]  effectively there was a total internet kill switch in place against
[3:08:05.240 --> 3:08:08.840]  conservatives nationals and populace and now that's happened and then I told
[3:08:08.840 --> 3:08:12.280]  everybody that they would then start moving to arrest individuals that
[3:08:12.280 --> 3:08:17.600]  demonstrate in protest using a second COVID-19 lockdown and that Trump need to
[3:08:17.600 --> 3:08:21.440]  get out front and fully repudiate COVID-19 is basically an overblown
[3:08:21.440 --> 3:08:26.280]  hoax he started to do that the last few months of the campaign but we have to
[3:08:26.280 --> 3:08:29.840]  understand that that's the pincer attack they're going to use they're going to use
[3:08:29.840 --> 3:08:33.680]  black lives matter and race for to start up the American people and divide us and
[3:08:33.680 --> 3:08:36.720]  they're gonna use economic warfare shutting down the economy to try to
[3:08:36.720 --> 3:08:41.560]  control us I hope people will listen now to my warnings because I'm on air tell

[3:10:33.680 --> 3:10:37.320]  you know talking about the what has happened with China and really the
[3:10:37.320 --> 3:10:43.240]  takeover of so many various aspects of a policy and impact and now people are
[3:10:43.240 --> 3:10:48.960]  afraid you see these big business leaders that millions billions even
[3:10:48.960 --> 3:10:55.600]  trillions at stake you know when you think about where China reaches in the
[3:10:55.600 --> 3:11:00.160]  world today and their influence they don't want to make them mad you see they
[3:11:00.160 --> 3:11:08.600]  don't want to lose the business but they don't care about values unless it's
[3:11:08.600 --> 3:11:14.000]  their bottom line see they translated it all into transactions all into money all
[3:11:14.000 --> 3:11:21.880]  into the material all into the earthy the fleshy the anchored you know and
[3:11:21.880 --> 3:11:28.400]  that's where that is at and the fear that's being pumped out is intended to
[3:11:28.400 --> 3:11:31.800]  dampen the West because here's the other war that they talk about and that's
[3:11:31.800 --> 3:11:37.520]  saying Chinese directory for how to waste the West the culture war and in
[3:11:37.520 --> 3:11:44.960]  case you haven't noticed look at the fire and the gas poured into that fight
[3:11:44.960 --> 3:11:49.920]  all over every major city in the last couple hundred days as this thing is
[3:11:49.920 --> 3:11:56.000]  escalated and continues to because each of these events offers opportunity for
[3:11:56.000 --> 3:12:00.640]  bad actors I've been saying it for a long time you got morons walking around
[3:12:00.640 --> 3:12:05.160]  abolish the police to ballast the police who are these stupid people right
[3:12:05.160 --> 3:12:10.520]  abolish the police what are you asking for take a look in the cities where
[3:12:10.520 --> 3:12:17.960]  they're asking for that you'll find out chaos looting craziness billions
[3:12:17.960 --> 3:12:24.920]  destroyed in assets insurance claims blah blah blah blah blah even deaths
[3:12:24.920 --> 3:12:33.920]  violence deaths and weirdos you know and the Chinese laugh all the way to the
[3:12:33.920 --> 3:12:40.280]  bank because they've looted us from the inside out from the values to the money
[3:12:40.280 --> 3:12:46.080]  they've managed to corrupt it all and we've let them in hey open up Pandora's
[3:12:46.080 --> 3:12:52.520]  box invite every disease every hassle every contrarian philosophy that
[3:12:52.520 --> 3:12:57.320]  violates the essence of what humans are you think China reflects that and their
[3:12:57.320 --> 3:13:04.480]  structure of governance that's it right is socialism but they let everybody
[3:13:04.480 --> 3:13:10.160]  own some stuff so they can acquire some factories and some productive capacity
[3:13:10.160 --> 3:13:14.640]  they don't mind letting people think they own some stuff because they can
[3:13:14.640 --> 3:13:21.520]  just take it in a snap of your fingers and they know it because they have the
[3:13:21.520 --> 3:13:28.040]  power you see now let's talk about power and how it plays out and we've heard
[3:13:28.040 --> 3:13:32.440]  about this I've been talking about the power of non-profits the freeloaders and
[3:13:32.440 --> 3:13:38.400]  I'm saying it loud and clear freeloaders accepting religion that
[3:13:38.400 --> 3:13:45.760]  government has no place in and they've managed to hold that front a bit you see
[3:13:45.760 --> 3:13:50.240]  it eroding when they open churches for voting but not for worship it's crazy
[3:13:50.240 --> 3:13:56.360]  right and we heard about that in the last hour in the last weeks you know the
[3:13:56.360 --> 3:14:01.840]  whole thing is getting flipped upside down with new narratives new words and
[3:14:01.840 --> 3:14:08.600]  new BS being sold as fertilizer and we need to recognize this is not
[3:14:08.600 --> 3:14:16.400]  fertilizer this is poison this is the poison pill of greed and materialism and
[3:14:16.400 --> 3:14:22.040]  what it gets you when we're only viewed as consumers and taxpayers feeding the
[3:14:22.040 --> 3:14:28.040]  P&L as the balance sheet of the nation is looted let me say that loud and clear
[3:14:28.040 --> 3:14:37.080]  looted I'm in the primary battleground the last loot being being extracted you
[3:14:37.080 --> 3:14:41.240]  see because Alaska is the treasury of the nation I've talked about it before
[3:14:41.240 --> 3:14:46.440]  I'm not getting into it today it's not the subject of the day but if you don't
[3:14:46.440 --> 3:14:51.240]  think the Chinese have been sniffing around at Arctic doorways you're wrong
[3:14:51.240 --> 3:14:58.640]  they have take a look at the news you know what are they interested in a feed
[3:14:58.640 --> 3:15:04.360]  of natural resources they can convert into stuff that they can eventually use
[3:15:04.360 --> 3:15:09.760]  against the West and they have been all along with all of our institutions our
[3:15:09.760 --> 3:15:16.720]  openness invites a modern warfare environment you know from creating rumors
[3:15:16.720 --> 3:15:23.000]  right political rumors is one of the tactics used in in the war that's going
[3:15:23.000 --> 3:15:31.880]  on trade wars not in some symbolic way but real war like blood and guts war
[3:15:31.880 --> 3:15:35.760]  only trade where you don't see the blood and guts but when people are
[3:15:35.760 --> 3:15:42.960]  unemployed and hungry and living in the street isn't that the same really and
[3:15:42.960 --> 3:15:47.320]  guess what it ties up more resources you know it's like the wounded in a battlefield
[3:15:47.320 --> 3:15:50.280]  they tie up three or four more to get them out of the battle feel better not
[3:15:50.280 --> 3:15:55.360]  to kill them wound a bunch of them it's what they're doing to our economies it's
[3:15:55.360 --> 3:16:01.120]  what they're doing to our people right now wound a bunch of them so everyone
[3:16:01.120 --> 3:16:05.840]  else has to scramble around and figure out the answers and that's happening
[3:16:05.840 --> 3:16:14.880]  right now economic it's happening through the panic party of pandemic endemic as
[3:16:14.880 --> 3:16:20.920]  Chinese move on producing their stuff laughing all the way they've wiped out
[3:16:20.920 --> 3:16:26.160]  the West they've destroyed supply chains they've crippled our economies they've
[3:16:26.160 --> 3:16:30.840]  bankrupted people half the small businesses in America gone and a bunch
[3:16:30.840 --> 3:16:36.000]  of them in Europe too and they keep falling away it's as if a big nuke went
[3:16:36.000 --> 3:16:42.120]  off in your city but nobody saw flash and that's what just happened folks it
[3:16:42.120 --> 3:16:47.280]  happened all over the world in a slow-motion train wreck that Alex and
[3:16:47.280 --> 3:16:54.200]  I and others have been talking about for a quarter of a century quoting the guys
[3:16:54.200 --> 3:16:58.600]  in the game all right now I've got a front row seat I've had a front row
[3:16:58.600 --> 3:17:03.520]  seat since 1971 to say open China because that's when my life kind of
[3:17:03.520 --> 3:17:07.960]  started as a young adult you know this is where I began to see the world
[3:17:07.960 --> 3:17:12.360]  differently as I sat outside of Washington DC and McLean Virginia being
[3:17:12.360 --> 3:17:17.480]  raised as a teenager and watching all hell break loose as the whole thing
[3:17:17.480 --> 3:17:23.360]  changed in 1971 and since this is Dr. Nick baggots we'll be right back after
[3:17:23.360 --> 3:17:40.480]  these important messages
[3:17:40.480 --> 3:17:47.080]  warning warning warning there is not long to stop the complete martial law
[3:17:47.080 --> 3:17:52.040]  takeover the giant third world collapse and a new world war that is going to be
[3:17:52.040 --> 3:17:56.480]  triggered by the new COVID lockdown announced by globalist systems in
[3:17:56.480 --> 3:18:01.840]  Europe in Asia and now in the United States Joe Biden is set to announce
[3:18:01.840 --> 3:18:06.680]  today that he has a new COVID task force that is calling for a national mass
[3:18:06.680 --> 3:18:12.320]  mandate to prove your servitude contact tracing forced inoculations coming but
[3:18:12.320 --> 3:18:17.840]  most importantly a new lockdown that way he can say that Trump is the blame for
[3:18:17.840 --> 3:18:23.400]  COVID they claim that only a new lockdown will stop COVID then of course
[3:18:23.400 --> 3:18:26.920]  when that new lockdown doesn't work those of us that didn't submit to the
[3:18:26.920 --> 3:18:30.440]  lockdown are gonna be blamed for it and that's when all the mass arrest start
[3:18:30.440 --> 3:18:35.040]  sometime towards the end of next year this is a permanent martial law plan
[3:18:35.040 --> 3:18:39.920]  Trump must be putiated exposed out seeing gates and the UN takeover not play
[3:18:39.920 --> 3:18:43.840]  games with it two in full wars best-selling products are now back

[3:20:43.760 --> 3:20:49.120]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[3:20:49.120 --> 3:21:11.200]  the Alex Jones show because there is a war on for your mind with Nick Begich
[3:21:11.200 --> 3:21:16.000]  welcome back you know I'm looking at this book during the break and I
[3:21:16.000 --> 3:21:21.120]  wanted to read a one-liner out of this it fits the day now remember this is one
[3:21:21.120 --> 3:21:26.200]  of years ago okay that this was written by the by the Chinese military for
[3:21:26.200 --> 3:21:30.960]  application how they look at warfare in the 21st century and they said by
[3:21:30.960 --> 3:21:36.000]  analyzing the chaos in Albania not long ago we can clearly see
[3:21:36.000 --> 3:21:40.240]  the role played by various types of foundations that were set up by
[3:21:40.240 --> 3:21:44.680]  transnational groups and millionaires with riches rivaling the wealth of
[3:21:44.680 --> 3:21:51.240]  nation states these foundations control the media control subsidies to
[3:21:51.240 --> 3:21:56.680]  political organizations and limit any resistance from the authorities resulting
[3:21:56.680 --> 3:22:01.720]  in the collapse of national order and the downfall of legally authorized
[3:22:01.720 --> 3:22:07.200]  government now that's a quote out of this Chinese book for what happened in
[3:22:07.200 --> 3:22:12.560]  Albania and now what's happening actually in the United States that was
[3:22:12.560 --> 3:22:17.520]  like the test run you know can you can you send in nonprofits what they call
[3:22:17.520 --> 3:22:23.160]  NGOs non-governmental organizations like the Gates Foundation into these
[3:22:23.160 --> 3:22:27.560]  countries to establish a foothold and then to have an impact on government and
[3:22:27.560 --> 3:22:32.000]  then change them by co-option by getting them to believe a little
[3:22:32.000 --> 3:22:35.640]  differently at the leadership level for whatever reason bribery corruption
[3:22:35.640 --> 3:22:41.440]  whatever you're doing to feed that beast to take the power from them and then
[3:22:41.440 --> 3:22:44.360]  control them and manipulate them and change the outcome by controlling the
[3:22:44.360 --> 3:22:49.720]  media outlets now the Chinese did this by buying the entertainment industry by
[3:22:49.720 --> 3:22:53.160]  having an impact on those that want to do business in China I mean you want to
[3:22:53.160 --> 3:22:57.920]  be Google in China you better why you know you want to play the game of big
[3:22:57.920 --> 3:23:03.840]  info in China you better why and that means you you dampen you tap down your
[3:23:03.840 --> 3:23:09.040]  values consistently and constantly in exchange for money that's what's
[3:23:09.040 --> 3:23:13.280]  happening it's about money it's about a lot of money and then eventually money
[3:23:13.280 --> 3:23:17.840]  runs out it's about power and then it's just a big chess game and that's the way
[3:23:17.840 --> 3:23:24.160]  these guys actually even refer to it as a big chess game where all of us are just
[3:23:24.160 --> 3:23:27.760]  pawns in the way in fact they're less than that you're not even players on the
[3:23:27.760 --> 3:23:34.920]  board let me say that again most of us are not even considered players on the
[3:23:34.920 --> 3:23:42.280]  board where the inconvenient deplorables as Hilary used to call us you know the
[3:23:42.280 --> 3:23:48.880]  masses of humanity that are thought of as some swill of flesh and that is not
[3:23:48.880 --> 3:23:54.280]  what we are and I resent that kind of diminishing of what we are because it
[3:23:54.280 --> 3:23:59.160]  continues to strip us of the very essence of what gives us the power that
[3:23:59.160 --> 3:24:04.720]  we are and they keep taking it from us and it's a robbery going on on a whole
[3:24:04.720 --> 3:24:13.920]  sale basis to grab the hearts and minds and defeat us without ever firing a
[3:24:13.920 --> 3:24:19.920]  shot and there's a lot of forces being used in this play by those that have an
[3:24:19.920 --> 3:24:27.240]  interest in subduing the human spirit in manipulating the human spirit and
[3:24:27.240 --> 3:24:33.800]  controlling what we are and this is the evil in it all you see because this
[3:24:33.800 --> 3:24:38.520]  strips us of what we actually are and replaces it with something synthetic and
[3:24:38.520 --> 3:24:44.320]  we keep seeing this play out in the information war because now these morons
[3:24:44.320 --> 3:24:51.200]  believe the answer is a chip in your head and a hook to your PC right what
[3:24:51.200 --> 3:24:58.200]  what stupidity is this okay and this is from limited thinking in a materialistic
[3:24:58.200 --> 3:25:02.480]  world that believe that that's what you need to connect people because it misses
[3:25:02.480 --> 3:25:10.000]  the fact that we already are and if you actually study the science that that is
[3:25:10.000 --> 3:25:16.080]  really blending this area of consciousness with physics and quantum
[3:25:16.080 --> 3:25:22.240]  physics it's where the meat of it is it's where a lot of explanation begins to
[3:25:22.240 --> 3:25:28.520]  take form on how this works is creative process works and why we can be so
[3:25:28.520 --> 3:25:34.760]  potent within the universe that's created and we're a part of and connected
[3:25:34.760 --> 3:25:39.680]  to in a fundamental way these things keep trying to break that connection from
[3:25:39.680 --> 3:25:45.200]  the face mask so we can no longer as easily perceive each other by covering
[3:25:45.200 --> 3:25:51.800]  our faces what's missed in that is it's in the eyes see this is where the power
[3:25:51.800 --> 3:25:57.880]  flows from us as living souls it's through our eyes through our vision through
[3:25:57.880 --> 3:26:01.840]  what we see it's even metaphorical right it's through our vision that we can
[3:26:01.840 --> 3:26:05.880]  create that which is around us right because we have to see it first in our
[3:26:05.880 --> 3:26:11.040]  called our minds eye and then projected through the eye so when you look into the
[3:26:11.040 --> 3:26:14.320]  eye of another you look into the soul of another and then you can discern some
[3:26:14.320 --> 3:26:19.000]  things but you can also get lost in that and forget the shell of the person in
[3:26:19.000 --> 3:26:24.200]  terms of how they behave in the materialistic fleshy world because within
[3:26:24.200 --> 3:26:32.240]  each soul within each pure pure soul of light that's in each of us this choice
[3:26:32.240 --> 3:26:39.680]  that decides how we do this how we play this out how we engage the world around
[3:26:39.680 --> 3:26:46.120]  us and the world that we cannot see around us the bigger world is that
[3:26:46.120 --> 3:26:50.720]  which we cannot see I often talk about the space around words if you want to
[3:26:50.720 --> 3:26:55.040]  know what someone's really thinking you got to get past the words you got to get
[3:26:55.040 --> 3:26:59.960]  deeper into the the elements around those words because words if they truly
[3:26:59.960 --> 3:27:04.240]  flew out of the heart of a person they contain an incredible amount of other
[3:27:04.240 --> 3:27:09.040]  information that flows in and gets conveyed clearly you can feel it like
[3:27:09.040 --> 3:27:13.600]  this conversation we're having today around the world you can feel it because
[3:27:13.600 --> 3:27:18.800]  we're engaged together in this because we see the power in this is our unity as
[3:27:18.800 --> 3:27:25.480]  living souls as we begin to formulate a new view of the world that allows us to
[3:27:25.480 --> 3:27:32.680]  retain our power within a very very uneasy time a fearful time even a
[3:27:32.680 --> 3:27:36.600]  worrisome time even and I would say that without I mean there's no exaggeration
[3:27:36.600 --> 3:27:42.560]  and on any of that we all see all that but this whole concept of living in a
[3:27:42.560 --> 3:27:47.000]  fearful state and the violin acts that come from it and just it's just a
[3:27:47.000 --> 3:27:54.720]  constant blow of anger as you suppress the human soul and that's what begins to
[3:27:54.720 --> 3:27:58.800]  break out on what we begin to see played out around the world and what I would
[3:27:58.800 --> 3:28:05.280]  say is let's get these issues addressed as quickly as we can because I don't
[3:28:05.280 --> 3:28:10.600]  believe they can stand the test in the courts the burden of proof to suppress
[3:28:10.600 --> 3:28:17.800]  an entire population with house arrest starting at 15 days and all of us
[3:28:17.800 --> 3:28:25.440]  laughing when they announced that nine months ago here we are you know and
[3:28:25.440 --> 3:28:32.080]  they're talking years decades forever chips in your hand to say you're good
[3:28:32.080 --> 3:28:37.360]  give me a break ladies gentlemen this is not the gateway experience we've been
[3:28:37.360 --> 3:28:42.960]  looking for this is a one we want to avoid and the reset can happen in either
[3:28:42.960 --> 3:28:49.600]  way because here's what I know the power of one or two who come into harmony who
[3:28:49.600 --> 3:28:55.640]  come into a clear perspective two or more gathered in his name right you have
[3:28:55.640 --> 3:29:01.000]  the faith of a mustard seed right greater things you shall do also right
[3:29:01.000 --> 3:29:07.120]  do you believe it or do you just parrot these words and hope they're true a lot
[3:29:07.120 --> 3:29:11.160]  of people do and I don't mean to diminish any of this but I got challenge you
[3:29:11.160 --> 3:29:15.080]  on that if you're one of those that hope that they're true then you're not a
[3:29:15.080 --> 3:29:24.960]  believer you bought an illusion you have no faith you have to know okay you don't
[3:29:24.960 --> 3:29:28.960]  know it's okay it's okay don't panic don't get worried like somehow you missed
[3:29:28.960 --> 3:29:36.800]  the boat no that's not the requirement requirement is to seek to know truth and
[3:29:36.800 --> 3:29:42.640]  you find it don't give up don't sell yourself short don't warm a pew don't
[3:29:42.640 --> 3:29:48.720]  be a bench warmers and oh yeah I believe I believe when you know be honest start
[3:29:48.720 --> 3:29:54.840]  with yourself God already knows the truth of it you know he already knows
[3:29:54.840 --> 3:30:00.960]  truth so start with yourself be honest if you don't know things ask things get
[3:30:00.960 --> 3:30:05.680]  revealed ask believe it voice it with your mouth with your words with the
[3:30:05.680 --> 3:30:10.760]  vibration that comes from your soul speak out what you don't know ask it
[3:30:10.760 --> 3:30:15.600]  shows up it's the way it works it's amazing when you do it but no it's true
[3:30:15.600 --> 3:30:19.240]  take the first step to act on what you know to be right and true that's where
[3:30:19.240 --> 3:30:22.680]  you reclaim your power that's the power of it that's your power it's yours to
[3:30:22.680 --> 3:30:26.920]  have yours to take yours to execute right now because what you're given is a
[3:30:26.920 --> 3:30:40.320]  God-given gift of choice and you have this is Nick baggage will be right when
[3:30:40.320 --> 3:30:43.120]  president Trump said that the mainstream corporate media was the enemy of
[3:30:43.120 --> 3:30:46.800]  America he really was telling the truth they don't just work for the Communist
[3:30:46.800 --> 3:30:50.640]  Chinese and the globalist the EU and the whole Hollywood America hating God
[3:30:50.640 --> 3:30:55.840]  hating crew they literally say that they are in control of our minds and believe
[3:30:55.840 --> 3:31:00.240]  they do own us and tell us who the president is even though that's not in
[3:31:00.240 --> 3:31:03.760]  law and they're just gaslighting the whole public over and over again saying
[3:31:03.760 --> 3:31:08.560]  Joe Biden's president-elect repeating it over and over again like a brainwashing
[3:31:08.560 --> 3:31:12.720]  mantra when it's up again to the state government to certify those votes most
[3:31:12.720 --> 3:31:15.880]  votes from being challenged there's massive evidence of fraud again this is
[3:31:15.880 --> 3:31:20.320]  so incredibly clear Biden said because he thought he was gonna lose up front
[3:31:20.320 --> 3:31:24.680]  that oh we're gonna challenge the vote no matter what until every votes counted
[3:31:24.680 --> 3:31:28.200]  well a lot of those have been counted and there's massive fraud being discovered
[3:31:28.200 --> 3:31:31.320]  so we're gonna hold the course here because Joe Biden is a Communist
[3:31:31.320 --> 3:31:34.800]  Chinese agent he's a globalist he wants carbon taxes people destroy this
[3:31:34.800 --> 3:31:39.440]  country by design to consolidate power and take control of us this is war
[3:31:39.440 --> 3:31:43.480]  remember Hillary Clinton remember Pelosi remember Bill Clinton remember
[3:31:43.480 --> 3:31:49.400]  Obama all of them said we are not gonna concede if there's a red mirage we
[3:31:49.400 --> 3:31:51.880]  believe it's gonna look like Trump's gonna win in landslides they had the
[3:31:51.880 --> 3:31:56.760]  internal polls and indeed Trump won most of the states he won last time by an
[3:31:56.760 --> 3:32:01.400]  even bigger margin and when he was set to win the other ones they froze these
[3:32:01.400 --> 3:32:06.400]  seven states on election night and then they brought in all of the reserve
[3:32:06.400 --> 3:32:09.520]  ballots they had this is completely transparent so when they say that he is
[3:32:09.520 --> 3:32:13.000]  president-elect he's not Trump has not conceded none of the states have
[3:32:13.000 --> 3:32:16.240]  certified the vote and now all these investigations have been opened up and
[3:32:16.240 --> 3:32:21.000]  avalanches mountains oceans of election fraud has come out and already been
[3:32:21.000 --> 3:32:25.280]  documented in Georgia officials are on record saying we've already found fraud
[3:32:25.280 --> 3:32:29.480]  so ladies and gentlemen the fixes in they've run bigger and bigger hoaxes
[3:32:29.480 --> 3:32:33.400]  every time because the last hoax failed but now this is the mother of all
[3:32:33.400 --> 3:32:36.800]  hoaxes and if they get away with this it's the end of America as we know it we

[3:33:46.600 --> 3:33:51.120]  there are disinformation groups and organizations saying Joe Biden is not
[3:33:51.120 --> 3:33:58.240]  president-elect well on its face he's not president-elect because the votes
[3:33:58.240 --> 3:34:03.440]  have not been certified by any of the 50 states and counting is still going on
[3:34:03.440 --> 3:34:09.080]  what in seven of the states and Trump is gaining ground in all but one of them
[3:34:09.080 --> 3:34:13.600]  and then there's also going to be recounts audits and all the spot checks
[3:34:13.600 --> 3:34:19.640]  already shown as a fraud but in comes the ace card the ace of spades big tech
[3:34:19.640 --> 3:34:24.200]  censorship is blocking not just the president not members of Congress but
[3:34:24.200 --> 3:34:28.360]  tens of millions of Americans from even sharing local news stations confirming
[3:34:28.360 --> 3:34:32.480]  the fraud this is a foreign-backed multinational takeover the United States
[3:34:32.480 --> 3:34:38.080]  Trump is battling a Chinese-backed new world order system bit on keeping us
[3:34:38.080 --> 3:34:44.960]  locked out forever in an economic war bring us to our knees you're listening
[3:34:44.960 --> 3:34:48.760]  to the Alex Jones show
[3:34:48.760 --> 3:35:14.960]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show and we're going into the last segment of
[3:35:14.960 --> 3:35:20.200]  the hour and you know a couple weeks and days or so after the election still
[3:35:20.200 --> 3:35:27.320]  have to math sort that that's out but really the disruption that's happening
[3:35:27.320 --> 3:35:32.080]  around the world right now is is purposeful and is is in fact the biggest
[3:35:32.080 --> 3:35:38.240]  war ever fought with the biggest casualties in terms of economy ever seen
[3:35:38.240 --> 3:35:46.240]  there's not a flash a gunpowder anywhere this is the wars the 21st century and
[3:35:46.240 --> 3:35:51.280]  what we predicted long ago and how it would play out is this is it no
[3:35:51.280 --> 3:35:55.960]  surprises here the script has been written you know I want to talk about
[3:35:55.960 --> 3:35:59.840]  I've been talking about a couple different segments areas of war but I
[3:35:59.840 --> 3:36:04.560]  want to talk about some of these psychological warfare this is again one
[3:36:04.560 --> 3:36:08.600]  of the things pointed out in the Chinese literature smuggling warfare media
[3:36:08.600 --> 3:36:13.360]  warfare drug warfare network warfare technological warfare fabrication
[3:36:13.360 --> 3:36:21.320]  warfare resource warfare economic aid warfare culture war war warfare sorry
[3:36:21.320 --> 3:36:26.440]  international law warfare okay this is where they use the institution I was
[3:36:26.440 --> 3:36:29.560]  talking about in one of the earlier segments the UN the World Trade
[3:36:29.560 --> 3:36:34.880]  Organization these other things these are opportunities to set up regulation
[3:36:34.880 --> 3:36:39.040]  benefit them hurt us they can cheat they cheat all the time there's no worries
[3:36:39.040 --> 3:36:43.800]  who's gonna penalize the cheaters they're a dictatorship for God's sake they
[3:36:43.800 --> 3:36:48.520]  don't analyze anyone but cheaters who don't cheat in their favor you know those
[3:36:48.520 --> 3:36:52.320]  who cheat for their own self-interest gives an excuse to go grab all their
[3:36:52.320 --> 3:36:56.440]  stuff and they do it all the time and they disappear them you know they grab
[3:36:56.440 --> 3:37:00.640]  all their stuff disappear the guy thank you very much for creating some wealth
[3:37:00.640 --> 3:37:05.920]  because communists leadership they don't have a clue either about making money
[3:37:05.920 --> 3:37:10.600]  they know that you think the military knows how to make money no they not
[3:37:10.600 --> 3:37:17.920]  destroy stuff that's a job okay but they use businesses we do it too the CIA
[3:37:17.920 --> 3:37:21.800]  underwrites a lot of the big tech company and then they own their asses you
[3:37:21.800 --> 3:37:25.680]  see and then they use them against us and the elected officials wander around
[3:37:25.680 --> 3:37:30.280]  stamped of approval because they're a bunch of shills in a game they're not
[3:37:30.280 --> 3:37:36.680]  even in control of the few players that know the game are writing the scripts and
[3:37:36.680 --> 3:37:43.360]  the others think they're no they think they're in they're not there's about a
[3:37:43.360 --> 3:37:48.160]  thousand players in the world about a dozen that really want to win badly
[3:37:48.160 --> 3:37:54.240]  enough to wipe everyone else out and they're around okay not to create more
[3:37:54.240 --> 3:37:59.200]  of a panic party or to feed into this because we've got the secret weapon the
[3:37:59.200 --> 3:38:10.840]  secret weapon the truth the power of the truth the power of the word when the
[3:38:10.840 --> 3:38:15.920]  word when what you say when the vibration of your voice carries its
[3:38:15.920 --> 3:38:22.360]  intentions so deeply so completely that it couples with consciousness in a way
[3:38:22.360 --> 3:38:26.040]  that brings us together this is what we do individually we do it in our
[3:38:26.040 --> 3:38:29.760]  households we do it with our friends we do it with our families although we may
[3:38:29.760 --> 3:38:34.760]  not see the fullness of it doesn't matter whether we see the fullness of it do
[3:38:34.760 --> 3:38:39.120]  the things you know to be right and true use your voice to express that which you
[3:38:39.120 --> 3:38:46.320]  know to be right and true not just think it say it not at a risk situation no
[3:38:46.320 --> 3:38:52.280]  don't get scared if you're fearful check your mouth okay you got to conquer
[3:38:52.280 --> 3:38:58.640]  the fear first so you have the power of knowing that allows you to deliver a
[3:38:58.640 --> 3:39:05.040]  message with absolute confidence knowing and that's the power of it everyone
[3:39:05.040 --> 3:39:09.560]  can see it everyone can feel that knowing so stick with what you know to be
[3:39:09.560 --> 3:39:13.320]  right and true people will feel that they'll respond to that we can make
[3:39:13.320 --> 3:39:18.160]  changes in ourselves with that we can change others by helping them see that
[3:39:18.160 --> 3:39:22.560]  possibility within themselves out by trying to dominate control and change
[3:39:22.560 --> 3:39:26.920]  them that's the other guys plan we don't have to do that we have to inform and
[3:39:26.920 --> 3:39:32.320]  remind help people remember what we are at our essence and then how to better
[3:39:32.320 --> 3:39:38.120]  project that who are fleshy filters they get it all screwed up you know and we've
[3:39:38.120 --> 3:39:42.360]  been warned about it in a lot of different words that 2000 years ago made a
[3:39:42.360 --> 3:39:45.880]  lot more sense in the way the syntax the way the words were expressed the way
[3:39:45.880 --> 3:39:49.200]  they were used a little tougher now you got to think about a little differently
[3:39:49.200 --> 3:39:54.680]  you know that's what I'm trying to do here in the last hour of the week you
[3:39:54.680 --> 3:40:00.280]  know the fourth hour of the week is to try and kind of pull all these world
[3:40:00.280 --> 3:40:06.080]  events back in because they are just events they're just flashes at the end
[3:40:06.080 --> 3:40:12.080]  of the day their grains of sand on the beach of eternity let me say that again
[3:40:12.080 --> 3:40:17.600]  they're grains of sand on the beach of eternity you see these things that we
[3:40:17.600 --> 3:40:21.800]  think are so vitally important and I'm not to say that they're not they are in
[3:40:21.800 --> 3:40:28.880]  this moment by Lee vitally important but is it more important that our cores
[3:40:28.880 --> 3:40:34.520]  stay intact we don't fall into fear because in our power stays intact as
[3:40:34.520 --> 3:40:38.840]  individuals because then we can begin to move confidently within the faith that
[3:40:38.840 --> 3:40:43.560]  we each have the faith of a mustard seed more than enough the widows might more
[3:40:43.560 --> 3:40:52.640]  than enough bigger than the riches of Bill Gates even okay I said it but but
[3:40:52.640 --> 3:40:57.080]  you don't necessarily believe it okay I can't illustrate it anymore for you all
[3:40:57.080 --> 3:41:03.280]  right I can only say this small things matter the smallest of things matter
[3:41:03.280 --> 3:41:08.280]  it's physics actually it's called the butterfly effect look it up and what it
[3:41:08.280 --> 3:41:13.840]  was was a very small change in one part of the world the flapping of a butterfly's
[3:41:13.840 --> 3:41:18.040]  wings in the right place in the right moment can create a hurricane on the
[3:41:18.040 --> 3:41:25.200]  other side of the planet it's a law of physics be that butterfly be those
[3:41:25.200 --> 3:41:31.760]  flapping wings recognize there's power in that there's no limit in that there's
[3:41:31.760 --> 3:41:37.640]  unlimited power and the choices that we each get to make we get to flap our
[3:41:37.640 --> 3:41:41.880]  wings when you do it with intention hurricanes happen on the other side of
[3:41:41.880 --> 3:41:46.080]  the world power of faith this power of prayer when you combine all of what you
[3:41:46.080 --> 3:41:51.440]  know to be right and true it's how the world changes it's how you reclaim your
[3:41:51.440 --> 3:41:56.880]  power how you change the very essence of who you are and begin to project
[3:41:56.880 --> 3:42:00.200]  differently in the world take your power back begin to affect those things
[3:42:00.200 --> 3:42:06.160]  around you in a way that is constructive not destructive and you begin to build
[3:42:06.160 --> 3:42:11.520]  there's millions of others doing the same know that to be right and true
[3:42:11.520 --> 3:42:18.560]  because you know it is right and true millions are doing the same are you
[3:42:18.560 --> 3:42:23.080]  doing the best you can are you making your best effort are you beating
[3:42:23.080 --> 3:42:29.320]  yourself up unnecessarily within that okay I'll say this in real strong words
[3:42:29.320 --> 3:42:32.800]  if you're one of those people that's highly critical of your own performance
[3:42:32.800 --> 3:42:38.200]  which most people are if they're a type personalities really critically your
[3:42:38.200 --> 3:42:44.920]  own performance all the time I would say this don't take that too far be as
[3:42:44.920 --> 3:42:52.520]  forgiving of yourself as God is how about that one whoa how about this if
[3:42:52.520 --> 3:42:56.440]  you're creating the image and likeness of God then to be self-condemning without
[3:42:56.440 --> 3:43:02.000]  doing something about it to condemn the highest creation of all you your living
[3:43:02.000 --> 3:43:08.480]  soul all the time what is that about what does that represent for me that's
[3:43:08.480 --> 3:43:15.240]  blaspheming against the highest creation of all to be self-critical as important
[3:43:15.240 --> 3:43:20.440]  as we know our flaws better than anyone to make changes to make choices that
[3:43:20.440 --> 3:43:25.920]  alter our course that's where the liberty happens and that's where the power is
[3:43:25.920 --> 3:43:30.880]  found again when we begin to take steps in a direction that changes us it
[3:43:30.880 --> 3:43:36.400]  changes us around us and they build something that's when consciousness
[3:43:36.400 --> 3:43:42.720]  comes together and God works through us in the calm of the center of the storm as
[3:43:42.720 --> 3:43:47.920]  I've said it before to be in the middle of it to see it all clearly around you
[3:43:47.920 --> 3:43:53.840]  but to stay calm in the middle of that storm so that your power is held and and
[3:43:53.840 --> 3:44:03.800]  amplified by being available right if you're depressed fearful worried you're
[3:44:03.800 --> 3:44:09.040]  not available for creative work you're in survival mode you're operating from
[3:44:09.040 --> 3:44:13.400]  the reptilian brain the adrenals are kicked in you're burning out your body
[3:44:13.400 --> 3:44:18.040]  your mind and your soul don't get lost in that we all do from time to time get
[3:44:18.040 --> 3:44:25.400]  lost in that find your center again pray for the peace of it again find the way
[3:44:25.400 --> 3:44:30.360]  to assert your own individual power in the world to change the world don't let
